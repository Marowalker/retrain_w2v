Leakage from cementitious structures with a retaining
function
can have devastating environmental consequences. Leaks can originate
from cracks within the hardened cementitious material that is supposed
to seal the structure off from the surrounding environment. Bioactive
self-healing concretes containing bacteria capable of microbially
inducing CaCO3 precipitation have been suggested to mitigate
the healing of such cracks before leaking occurs. An important parameter
determining the biocompatibility of concretes and cements is the pH
environment. Therefore, a novel ratiometric pH optode imaging system
based on an inexpensive single-lens reflex (SLR) camera was used to
characterize the pH of porewater within cracks of submerged hydrated
oil and gas well cement. This enabled the imaging of pH with a spatial
distribution in high resolution (50 μm per pixel) and a gradient
of 1.4 pH units per 1 mm. The effect of fly ash substitution and hydration
time on the pH of the cement surface was evaluated by this approach.
The results show that pH is significantly reduced from pH >11 to
below
10 with increasing fly ash content as well as hydration time. The
assessment of bioactivity in the cement was evaluated by introducing
superabsorbent polymers with encapsulated Bacillus
alkalinitrilicus endospores into the cracks. The bacterial
activity was measured using oxygen optodes, which showed the highest
bacterial activity with increasing amounts of fly ash substitution
in the cement, correlating with the decrease in the pH. Overall, our
results demonstrate that the pH of well cements can be reliably measured
and modified to sustain the microbial activity.

==== Body
Introduction
Crack formation can severely reduce the
lifetime of cementitious
materials. Even small cracks are penetrated by water with erosive
and corrosive ions that further widen the cracks and corrode steel
reinforcements.1,2 In installations designed with
a retaining function, cracks may compromise the tightness, allowing
either dangerous substances to reach the environment or loss of pressure
in a pressurized system.1 One such cement
application where tightness is highly important is the cementing of
wells used in the oil and gas industry.3 Here, cementing serves to position steel casings in the borehole
and to seal off and isolate different sections of the well. Cracks
in oil and gas well cement installations can lead to the loss of zonal
isolation in the well, resulting in a significant loss in well productivity
with a corresponding negative economic impact.4 Another concern is “plug and abandonment” of oil and
gas wells, where decommissioned wells are plugged with cement to contain
the remnant gas and oil inside the abandoned well. Loss of zonal isolation
in active oil and gas wells and fluid leakage due to cracks in cement
plugs can lead to serious environmental issues.5 Strategies to potentially mitigate these cracks in the
cement are self-“healing” or -“sealing”
of the cracks by either chemical or biological agents mixed into the
wet cementitious mixture.6,7 Chemical self-healing
agents typically consists of encapsulated precursors of polymers,
such as epoxy resins or cyanoacrylates.6,8−10 Recently, biologically based healing of concrete has been proposed
as an alternative self-healing technique, utilizing bacterial activity
to precipitate CaCO3 inside the cracks of concrete in above-ground
structures.7,11−14 Products of chemical healing
agents designed for well cement are commercially available;15,16 however, a bioactive self-healing well cement is yet to be engineered.
The limitation on biological activity in well cement lies in the nature
of the cement composition. Contrary to concretes, well cement does
not contain sand or other large aggregates; instead, it is a pure
cement paste with various additives.17Cement produces alkalinity during hydration due to the
dissolution of alkali ions and portlandite (Ca(OH)2) from
the cement phases. As pH influences the bacterial activity, it is
paramount to investigate the pH within well cements to further the
potential development of a bioactive self-healing cement for use in
oil and gas wells.

The pH of concretes has previously been measured
with potentiometric18−20 or fiber optic sensors,21,22 and recently with optical
sensing using planar optodes with an advanced lifetime camera, generating
high-resolution images that show a detailed spatial distribution of
the pH.23−25 Based on measurements with potentiometric sensors,
the pH of concrete can be as high as 12.5; however, these values often
represent the pH of milled concrete suspensions in water and not as
such the pH of the porewater within the cementitious matrix.19,20 Fiber optic sensors can be cast inside the cementitious matrix and
record the pH over time (pH 12.622); however,
this technique does not take the spatial resolution of the matrix
into consideration.

The pH of well cements has previously only
been determined for
slurry mixes (pH > 11.8);26 however,
no
high-resolution data of the spatial distribution of pH in the porewater
or inside cracks exists for hardened well cements used in the oil
and gas industry. Microbial life occurs in natural alkaline environments;
however, a pH above 11 is generally not suitable for bacterial activity.27,28 Thus, such high pH values would hardly allow any bacteria-induced
precipitation of CaCO3 to occur.

Here, a basic single-lens
reflex (SLR) camera was modified to image
the pH and oxygen consumption in a highly alkaline cracked well cement.
In an effort to reduce the pH of well cement specimens, pozzolanic
fly ash was added, which reacts with calcium and hydroxyl ions in
solutions, reducing the amount of formed portlandite and thereby the
pH at high substitution levels.29,30 A novel pH planar optode
was used to measure the pH of the porewater in the cement matrix and
the water in induced cracks in hardened well cements. The experiments
were conducted with various amounts of fly ash substitution to evaluate
the effect on the pH. The bioactive potential of well cement was evaluated
by measuring the oxygen consumption inside the cracks using oxygen
planar optodes.

Results and Discussion
Two-Dimensional (2D) Determination of pH Inside of Cracks of
Well Cement
It is paramount to understand the abiotic factors
affecting the metabolic activity and growth when implementing biology
in a nonbiological system. For cementitious materials, the highly
alkaline pH of the pore solution likely represents a key controlling
factor. Imaging pH at highly alkaline conditions found within cement
is not trivial and has only recently been demonstrated for concrete
surfaces.23−25 While those studies used a lifetime-based readout,
the present work is the first report of the ratiometric pH imaging
of cement using a single-lens reflex camera that can be acquired easily
and without large investments (approximately $1000). As the applied
pH indicator emits light in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the
electromagnetic spectrum, it was necessary to remove the NIR blocking
filter from the camera prior to the experiments.31 A typical sigmoidal calibration curve was obtained with
this equipment, and the pH indicator system enabled imaging pH within
the range 8–11 (Figure 1). Measuring pH optically allowed the visualization of the
spatial distribution of pH in the porewater of the cement matrix and
in the induced cracks without destructive sampling. The pH of the
well cement was measured in a high resolution of up to 50 μm
per pixel with a steep gradient of 1.4 pH unit per 1 mm visually observed,
equivalent to more expensive systems.23−25

Figure 1 Calibration curve of
pH optode and experimental setup. The colors
of the calibration curve are the true colors of the raw RGB images
at the respective pH. The calibration curve has its dynamic range
between pH 8 and 11, which is thus the pH range of the optode. The
cement specimen is pressed on the optode and kept in place by a distance
spacer. The camera with removed NIR filter is coupled to the LED light
source through a trigger box controlled by the image acquisition program
on the computer.

The optode design allowed measurements of pH at
the cement surface
when pressed against the pH-sensitive film of the optode (Figure 2). The measured values
represent the pH of the water layer in contact with the optode and
in direct equilibrium with the porewater in the outer layers of the
cement specimens. In agreement, the substitution of fly ash caused
the pH measured inside cracks to decrease (Figure 2). Cement hydration results in the formation
of a calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H)
phase and portlandite as the main hydration products, where the solubility
of portlandite buffers the pH of the pore solution.32 The reaction of fly ash consumes portlandite and forms
C–S–H and calcium aluminate hydrate phases similar to
those found in hydrated Portland cement.30 Thus, the degree of fly ash reaction depends on the available amount
of portlandite and high substitution levels can thereby be used to
reduce the pH of the pore solution in blended cements. The pH of the
porewater in pure well cement hydrated for 1 month exceeded 11 (Figure 2), which will expectedly
diminish the bacterial activity.27,28 The induced
crack with the ingress of artificial seawater (ASW, pH 8) was equilibrated
to the same pH as the cement porewater within 1 h of experiment time
(Figure 2), suggesting
that pure well cement is not compatible with biological healing agents.
Notably, the pH of the pure well cement porewater is above the dynamic
pH range of the optode (Figure 1 and Figure 2). However, other optode chemistries may cover higher pH values.23,24 When substituting the cement by 10 wt % of fly ash, the pH of the
porewater decreases to a measurable level at ∼10.5. At this
pH, for example, Bacillus alkalinitrilicus, which is the biological agent used in self-healing concrete applications,7 would still be active but not exhibit growth.33 Only the initial wide opening of the crack can
be visually seen in the pH profiles of the 10–20 wt % fly ash
substituted specimens, since the rest of the crack reaches the same
pH as the cement. Apparently, the buffering capacity of portlandite
in the blended cement with 10–20% fly ash substitution was
sufficient to increase the pH of the entering ASW to the level of
the cement pore solution. For the 30–40 wt % fly ash substitution
specimens, approximately half of the crack length has a lower pH than
the cement porewater (Figure 2). When 50 wt % of the cement is replaced by fly ash, the
entire crack is visible as the portlandite buffering capacity is reduced
to such an extent that the pH inside the cracks is ∼9–10,
which represents the optimum pH for the growth of B.
alkalinitrilicus.33

Figure 2 pH imaging
of well cement specimens with varying percentages of
fly ash substitution. The optode measures pH in the range of 8–11,
thus the white color in the images correspond to a pH value of more
or equal to 11 and black less or equal to 8. The dotted line is the
outline of the cement specimens with induced cracks. Substituting
10 wt % of the cement with fly ash decreases the pH within the pH
range of the optode. Increasing the substitution of fly ash does not
seem to influence the pH of the porewater in the cement itself; however,
the induced crack becomes more and more visible due to a decrease
in the cements alkaline buffering capacity. At 30–50 wt % fly
ash substitution, the pH of the ingressed ASW is not nearly as affected
by the cement as in 0–20 wt %. The 40 wt % specimen had a rougher
surface and therefore not as good a contact to the optode as the others,
which is why the pH fluctuates in this particular image. The measurements
were highly replicable but did depend on a good specimen to optode
contact.

Decrease of pH by Increased Hydration Time to Potentially Sustain
Bacterial Activity in Cracks of Well Cement
Portlandite is
mainly produced by the reaction of the calcium silicate phases, alite
and belite (impure forms of Ca3SiO5 and Ca2SiO4, respectively), the principal phases in Portland
cement, which also result in the formation of the C–S–H
phase, which is the main phase responsible for the strength development.
Alite reacts within hours to days, whereas belite hydration takes
place over roughly 1−4 weeks, contributing to the strength
development at later ages.32 After a few
days, the formed C–S–H phase resulted in a dense material,
slowing down the hydration of the remains of alite and belite, as
the dissolution and precipitation reactions become diffusion controlled.
Fly ash reacts after the hydration of alite and over longer time and
thus the amount of portlandite in the cement matrix will decrease
with time and increasing degree of fly ash reaction. Thus, the pH
in the pore solution will decrease, in particular after the depletion
of portlandite. The consumption of portlandite can explain the decrease
in the pH when comparing cement specimens prehydrated for 1 month
(pH > 11) to those prehydrated for 2 months (pH ∼ 10) (Figure 3). For the specimen
with 50 wt % fly ash substitution, the pH decreased from 10.5 to 9.75
for the specimens hydrated for 1 and 2 months. The pH inside the crack
decreased even more from 10 to 9.25 in the part of the crack furthest
away from the penetrating ASW. Thus, the addition of a significant
amount of pozzolanic material such as fly ash to the cement results
in an accelerated decrease in pH, thereby potentially further facilitating
bacterial activity.

Figure 3 pH imaging of well cement with 0 or 50 wt % fly ash substitution
and 1 (top) or 2 (bottom) months of prehydration times. Extended prehydration
time alone reduces the pH of the cement porewater from above 11 to
∼10. Substituting 50 wt % of the cement with fly ash and extending
the prehydration time decreased the pH of the cement porewater to
below 10 and that inside the crack to ∼9.

Mapping Bacterial Activity in Well Cement
As discussed
above, the measured pH regime within submillimeter-sized cracks of
pure and fly ash substituted well cement suggest that only the fly
ash substituted cement specimens will sustain bacterial activity.
To test this prediction, freeze-dried superabsorbent polymers (SAPs)
with B. alkalinitrilicus endospores
were added to cracks in cement specimens and hydrated with a suitable
growth medium. The aerobic respiratory activity of the bacteria inside
the cracks was subsequently monitored with oxygen optodes, which enables
the reversible visualization of oxygen concentrations in 2D (similarly
to the pH optode images) to quantify bacterial oxygen consumption
inside the cracks.

In all cement specimens, the oxygen air saturation
within cracks containing hydrated SAPs decreased immediately upon
exposure to the oxygen optode (Figure 4), demonstrating that the embedded endospores of the
bacteria were able to germinate and grow even in the pure well cement.
However, the inferred respiratory activity was very low and spotty
in the cracks of pure well cement but increased substantially with
the increasing degree of fly ash substitution and thus decreasing
pH (Figure 2). The
pH decreased from above 10 to 9.25 inside the cracks in these samples
with increasing fly ash substitutions. B. alkalinitrilicus has a pH range of 7–10.2 with an optimum at 9,33 which leads to more activity and O2 consumption in the samples with the most fly ash substitution, as
the pH inside the cracks in these specimens resembles the pH optimum
of the bacteria. Given that all other parameters, except fly ash substitution,
were kept constant, this also highlights pH as a key factor limiting
the bacterial activity in these experiments. In pure well cement,
leaching of portlandite due to longer hydration times alone may therefore
likely allow bacteria with a pH tolerance similar to that of B. alkalinitrilicus to metabolize and precipitate
CaCO3.

Figure 4 Oxygen imaging of the bacterial activity of SAPs encapsulated
endospores
induced to germinated inside cracks of well cement. The air saturation
decreases due to aerobe bacterial activity. Arrows indicate microbially
active SAP particles inside the cracks of the cement specimens. The
microbial oxygen consumption is detected in all images, even inside
the cracks of pure well cement; however, the activity increases with
increasing amounts of fly ash substitution. The oxygen consumption
seen in the bottom of the images in the specimens is due to the bacterial
activity originating from the crack transported downward by a thin
flow of water between the cement specimen and optode.

The oxygen consumption originates from B. alkalinitrilicus loaded SAP particles placed inside
the cement cracks in all the
cement specimens (Figure 4, arrows). The aerobic B. alkalinitrilicus cells use oxygen to oxidize the supplemented electron donor (Na-lactate),
and the decrease in oxygen concentration around cracks is due to their
activity. In the 2D images of the oxygen concentration inside cracks
(Figure 4), downward
streaks of lower oxygen concentrations from the crack opening are
evident. These are caused by a flow of a thin watery film between
the cement specimen and optode (Figure 4). Unfortunately, surface roughness makes it impossible
to avoid such flow-induced movements. Contrary to the pH optode that
is composed of a swelling hydrogel, the oxygen optode used in this
study is more sensitive to surface roughness. This explains the observed
flow-induced water movement. For structurally complex surfaces, optical
sensor particles have been shown to be suitable alternatives, enabling
oxygen imaging even on complex biological surfaces.34 Nevertheless, for the current study, the oxygen optode
system used here was sufficient and enabled the estimations of bacterial
activity in 2D.

pH has not previously been measured in cementitious
materials for
the application of microbial self-healing compatibility. The evidence
of bacterial precipitation of CaCO3 in concrete specimens
inoculated with B. alkalinitrilicus is strong. Thus, the pH in ordinary Portland cement based concrete
must be within the biocompatible range.7 Concrete surfaces exposed to accelerated carbonation or biogenic
acid attack show the pH values, measured optically, in the range of
above 12 to below 10 similar to the results presented here.23−25 It is therefore not surprising that the alkaliphile B. alkalinitrilicus would metabolize in both concrete
and hardened well cement specimens.

Conclusions
Oil and gas well cements are very alkaline
with the pH above 11
for pure hydrated cements. Here, we found that the buffering capacity
can be reduced to an extent where bacterial activity occurs and thrives
by the addition of supplementary pozzolanic materials. Although significant
amounts of fly ash may hardly be introduced in well cements for other
reasons, the present work shows that the partial replacement of cement
by pozzolanic materials may reduce the pH of the cement pore solution
to a level at which the bacterial activity can occur. Thus, this study
is a step toward the design of suitable bioactive self-healing well
cement formulations that may contribute to a more sustainable construction
of future oil wells with longer service life times and an improved
material for well abandonment.

Experimental Section
Cement Specimen Preparation
The main component used
for the specimen preparation in this study was a class G cement, commonly
used for wells in the oil and gas industry.26,35 The mix was prepared with 0.25% by volume of polypropylene fibers
to keep the specimens attached after the introduction of cracks, and
with varying additions of fly ash (Table 1). The ingredients were mixed by a blender-type
homogenizer for 1 min and then poured into 40 mm × 40 mm ×
160 mm prismatic molds. The specimens were demolded after 48 h and
then postcured in demineralized water at 20 °C for 20 days.Figure 5 Schematic presentation
of prismatic cement specimens: (A) specimens

cracks in prismatic specimens while continuously measuring the crack
width.

After 20 days of curing, cracks were induced in a
3-point bending
setup (Figure 5). The
cracks were induced by deformation controlled tests by applying a
loading rate of 0.1 mm/min of cross-head displacement. When a crack
mouth opening displacement (CMOD) of 0.8 mm was reached, a plastic
wedge was installed at the widest part of the crack to keep this size.
After cracking, specimens were submerged in demineralized water at
20 °C for an additional 30 or 60 days to induce portlandite leaching
and reduction in pH before conducting the pH measurements.

Preparation of pH and Oxygen Planar Optodes
Luminescence-based
pH and oxygen imaging was performed using planar optodes. For the
oxygen-sensitive foil, 1.5 mg of the indicator dye platinum(II) meso-tetra(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin
(PtTFPP; Frontier Scientific, Logan, Utah), 1.5 mg of the reference
dye Macrolex fluorescence yellow (Lanxess, Köln, Germany),
100 mg of diamond powder (1–2 μm, Microdiamant.com),
and 100 mg of polystyrene (MW ∼192.000, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen,
Germany) were dissolved/dispersed in 1 g of chloroform and knife-coated
(∼12 μm thickness) on a dust-free poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET) foil (Puetz Folien, Taunusstein, Germany). The indicator emits
in the red part of the spectrum (red channel within a RGB image),
while the reference dye emits a green light (green channel).

The pH-sensitive optode consisted of a NIR pH indicator with a high
pKa, namely, DiF-OH-aza-BODIPY (compound
4 in ref (31)), and
the green emitting coumarin based reference dye Bu3Coum.36 A 0.5 mg of the indicator, 0.4 mg of the reference
dye, 100 mg of diamond powder, and 100 mg of Hydromed D4 (purchased
from AdvanSource Biomaterials) were dissolved/dispersed in 1 g of
tetrahydrofuran (THF) and again knife coated on a poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET) foil to give a ∼12 μm thickness sensor layer.

Optical Sensing of pH and O2 in Well Cement
The pH and O2 planar optodes were mounted at the sidewall
of a 6 L aquarium with an electrical tape (carefully avoiding the
formation of air bubbles between the glass and the optode). Cement
specimens were pressed against the optode with a specially designed
distance spacer made of rubber to ensure that the specimen was pressed
against the optode as tight as possible (Figure 1). The aquarium was filled with sterile artificial
seawater (ASW, void of sulfates to eliminate sulfate attack, salinity
of 35‰, pH 8) and kept at 30 °C using a temperature-controlled
Lauda α RA8 water bath (LAUDA–Brinkmann, LP, Delran,
New Jersey). Both optodes were excited using the same blue (470 nm)
LED (i-led, ILH-GD01-DEBL-SC201; r-s components, Copenhagen, Denmark)
powered by a USB-controlled LED driver unit.37 Images were taken after 60 min of contact with an SLR camera (EOS
1300D; Canon, Tokyo, Japan), modified by removing the near-infrared
filter (NIR filter) to obtain sufficient signal from the pH indicator.
The camera was equipped with a macro objective (100 mm f/2.8 AT-X
M100 AF Pro D; Tokina, Tokyo, Japan) and a 530 nm long-pass filter
(OG530 SCHOTT, 52 mm × 2 mm) to block out the excitation light.
LED excitation and image acquisition were controlled and synchronized
with the software look@RGB.37 The optodes
were calibrated in the aquarium in the same ASW prior to the experiment.
Oxygen calibrations were obtained by flushing the water in the aquarium with
a known air/N2 mixture (using red-y massflow controllers
from Vögtlin, Switzerland), while the oxygen saturation in
the aquarium was checked using a calibrated commercial oxygen sensor
(OXROB3 oxygen sensor connected to a FireStingGO2; both from Pyroscience,
Aachen, Germany) (Figure S1). In a similar
fashion, the pH optode was calibrated by adjusting the pH within the
aquarium adding appropriate amounts of 5 M NaOH and performing simultaneous
reference measurements using a calibrated glass pH electrode (Radiometer
Analytical–Hach Company, Loveland, Colorado) (Figure 1).

Image processing was
performed with ImageJ38 using the plugin
Ratio Plus as described in detail elsewhere.39,40

Microbial Activity in Cement Cracks
To assess the potential
for sustaining bacterial activity inside cracks of well cement, endospores
of B. alkalinitrilicus were encapsulated
in a superabsorbent polymer (SAP) and manually introduced into cracks. B. alkalinitrilicus endospores were produced on modified
Schaeffer’s medium and encapsulated in an acrylamide polymer
cross-linked with bis-acrylamide to give superabsorbent properties.41 The endospore amended SAPs were freeze-dried
until all water had sublimated and ground to <0.5 mm diameter particles
in an agate mortar. The SAP particles were placed inside the entire
length of the cracks of the well cement specimens with sterile tweezers.
The cement specimens with 0–50 wt % fly ash substitution were
prepared identically to the specimens above and prehydrated for 60
days at 20 °C before the endospore-amended SAPs were added to
the cracks. The SAPs were hydrated inside the cracks with a concentrated
sodium lactate based medium, Na-lactate 70 mM, NaCl 0.1 M, yeast extract
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) 1 g/L, which caused the SAP particles
to swell and fill out the entire void of the crack. The specimens
were then incubated in a closed humidified plastic container (0.5
m × 0.3 m × 0.3 m) for 5 days. Every 24 h, 2 mL of sterile
medium was added to the cement cracks to support the germination and
growth of endospores to a substantial cell density before oxygen measurements
by planer optodes in the aquarium setup described above (Figures 1, S1, and S2).
