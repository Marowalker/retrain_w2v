The 239+240Pu activities and 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios in surface sediments from the major
river basins in
southern China were analyzed to investigate the distribution and source
of Pu. We clarified that the 239+240Pu activities in these
river basins were very similar, however, only the 239+240Pu activities in the Jinjiang Basin were generally higher than other
samples. Because of river transport function, the distribution of 239+240Pu activities in these river basins presented an increasing
trend from the upstream region to the estuary. According to the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios, the Pu source in the inner
river basins might be from global fallout, and the Pu in river estuaries
might be from the global fallout and the Pacific Proving Grounds (PPG)
in the Marshall Islands. Using a mass balance of the Pu model, we
quantified in the Pearl River Estuary and the Pu contribution from
the Pearl River Basin to Pu inventory was 13 ± 5%. These data
not only filled in a knowledge gap of Pu in these river basins but
also served as background data for Pu contamination from a nuclear
reactor. Also, there are several planned and operating nuclear power
plants in these river basins and these data could provide some indications
for dealing with nuclear accidents in different parts of river basins
in the future. In this study, we also analyzed some factors that would
affect the distribution of 239+240Pu activities; however,
only total organic carbon (TOC) content and the heavy metal As had
a positive correlation with the 239+240Pu activity.

Introduction
Plutonium (Pu), caused by atmospheric
nuclear weapons tests,1 nuclear power plants,
nuclear accidents (e.g.,
Fukushima accident), and nuclear fuel reprocessing,2,3 was
mainly derived from the global fallout. Anthropogenic radionuclides 239Pu (T1/2 = 24 100 years)
and 240Pu (T1/2 = 6560 years)
have high radiological toxicity and long-term retention in the environment.
It was estimated that approximately 15 000 TBq 239+240Pu was produced by atmospheric nuclear weapon tests, and approximately
12 500 TBq was globally distributed via the stratosphere.4239Pu and 240Pu with relatively
long half-life have been used as tracers to analyze series processes
of Pu in nature, including the sources of Pu, Pu inputs, and distribution,
rebuilding the Pu historical events, migration of Pu in seas and land,
and special impacts on the environment.5−12 For example, the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio can
provide fingerprints for different sources,13 and it is considered an excellent indicator for nuclear forensics.
In detail, the weapons-grade Pu has the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio of 0.01–0.07,6 the
Pu from nuclear reactor-grade has the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio of 0.2–1.0,14 the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio from global fallout is approximately
0.178 ± 0.019,15 while the Pu from
the Pacific Proving Ground (PPG) in the Marshall Islands has the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio of 0.30–0.36.16,17 In addition, the Pu caused by the Fukushima accident (FNA) has the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio of 0.30–0.38.13,14

In the past few years, many researchers have studied Pu in
China.
In mainland China, the activity of 239+240Pu in surface
soils showed obvious latitude-dependent distribution, with maximum
settlement occurring between 40°N and 50°N.18 The average atom ratio of 240Pu/239Pu is 0.19, indicating that the Pu source in surface soils is mainly
from global fallout.18−20 It is well known that 45 nuclear tests had been conducted
at the Lop Nor nuclear test site from 1964 to 1996, 23 of which were
atmospheric nuclear tests, which is located in the northwestern part
of China.21 A 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio of 0.103 was found in sediments from Lake Sugan located
ca. 500 km southeast of the Lop Nor test site.22 A similar 240Pu/239Pu ratio (0.080)
was found in a sediment core collected from Lake Bosten, which is
the closest lake to the Lop Nor nuclear test site.10 Moreover, a three-peak pattern vertical distribution of
Pu in a sediment core was collected in Lake Chenghai, and one peak
indicated that the Pu might have been derived from Chinese nuclear
tests (CNTs) during the 1970s.23 However,
the source of Pu in Chinese marginal seas is complicated. Many previous
studies on the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios in Chinese
marginal seas have found that these values are between the value of
global fallout (0.178 ± 0.019) and the signature value (0.30–0.36)
of the PPG, which indicates a finite fraction of Pu from PPG into
Chinese marginal seas via some ocean currents (the North Equatorial
Current and Kuroshio Current).11,12,24 Even the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios in some surface
sediments of river estuaries in China are also higher than the value
of global fallout but lower than the value of PPG, indicating that
PPG and global fallout are mainly the sources of Pu in some river
estuaries (Table 1).7,9,11

Although there have been some studies on the transportation
and
distribution of Pu in China, there is less information on the Pu in
Chinese river basins. In this study, we selected several surface sediments
of river basins in southern China, including the Pearl River Basin,
coastal rivers in western Guangdong Province (WGC), the Jinjiang Basin
and the Minjiang Basin (Figure 1). We did a series of tests, including the 239+240Pu activity, the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio, the
content of clay, and the content of total organic carbon (TOC) of
these samples, aiming (1) to investigate the distribution of 239+240Pu activity and 240Pu/239Pu atom
ratio; (2) to identify the source of Pu and to fill in the gap of
Pu in the major river systems in southern China; (3) to identify the
function of Pu transport in river basins and to provide the basic
background data for the planned and operational nuclear power plants
in Chinese river basins; and (4) to analyze some factors (the content
of clay, TOC, heavy metals) that affect the 239+240Pu activity.

The Pearl River is the second longest river in
China and the Pearl
River Basin is comprised of four tributaries: the Dongjiang River,
Beijiang River, Xijiang River, and some rivers of the Pearl River
Delta (PRD). The coastal rivers in western Guangdong Province (WGC)
mainly refer to the rivers that flow into the sea from the west of
the Pearl River estuary to the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong Province.
The Jinjiang basin originates from Daiyun Mountain in central Fujian
Province, Dongxi and Xixi tributaries are on the upper reach, and
the Xixi tributary is the source of this basin. The Minjiang basin
is the largest river flowing into the East China Sea in Fujian Province,
which is composed of three main tributaries: Jianxi, Futunxi, and
Shaxi, and Shaxi is the source of the basin. Hainan Island is a tropical
island with three major rivers on the island, namely, Wanquan River
in the eastern part of the island, Nandu River in the northern part
of the island, and Changhua River in the midwest part of the island.

In this study, we used the basin partitioning function of the GeoMap
app to divide the main river basins in our study region (the dark
red lines in Figures 2 and 3). However, we divided WGC into the
Pearl River Basin because of the partition. (The individual watershed
system of WGC is less affected by the upstream Xijiang and Pearl River
Basins.) Moreover, our samples were selected from the main streams
and tributaries of these river basins, representing all the river
basins (Figure 2).

Results and Discussion
The analytical results of the 239+240Pu activities and 240Pu/239Pu
atom ratios in the surface sediments
of river basins in southern China are summarized in Table S1.

239+240Pu Activities
The 239+240Pu activities in surface sediments collected from river basins in
southern China ranged from 0.01 to 4.676 mBq/g. Therein, a wide range
of 239+240Pu activities was found in the surface sediments
of the Pearl River Basin at 0.011–3.322 mBq/g (mean: 0.242
± 0.065 mBq/g). While a sample (E31) (3.322 ± 0.499 mBq/g)
collected from Dongjiang estuary (Pearl River Basin) had the highest 239+240Pu activity (Figures 1 and 2) in samples of Pearl
River Basin, and most of the samples collected from the Pearl River
Basin had similar 239+240Pu activities to the 239+240Pu activities found in the Pearl River estuary (0.026–0.137
mBq/g) (Table S1).11 Moreover, similar 239+240Pu activities were observed
in surface sediments near the Yangtze estuary.7 The samples collected from WGC had 239+240Pu activities
from 0.033 to 4.676 mBq/g (mean: 0.609 ± 0.028 mBq/g). Only one
sample (W73), closed to the South China Sea (Figures 1 and 2), had the highest 239+240Pu activity (4.676 ± 0.075 mBq/g) in WGC samples.
Different from the surface sediments collected from the Pearl River
Basin and WGC, the samples from Jinjiang basin had 239+240Pu activities ranging from 0.091 to 0.586 mBq/g, with an average
of 0.374 ± 0.057 mBq/g. Unfortunately, there was only one sample
that was collected from Minjiang basin (E40), with a 239+240Pu activity of 0.029 ± 0.011 mBq/g. The samples collected from
rivers in Hainan Province had the 239+240Pu activities
from 0.034 to 0.076 mBq/g (mean: 0.056 ± 0.016 mBq/g).

In Figure 2, the distribution
of 239+240Pu activity presented an increasing trend from
the upstream and midstream to the estuary, and some higher values
appeared in some estuaries. For example, in the Pearl River Basin,
the average 239+240Pu activity was approximately 0.173
± 0.040 mBq/g in the upstream region, approximately 0.479 ±
0.047 mBq/g in the midstream region, and 0.560 ± 0.082 mBq/g
in the downstream region. Similar to the Jinjiang basin, the average 239+240Pu activities in the upstream and downstream regions
were approximately 0.302 ± 0.051 and 0.417 ± 0.037 mBq/g,
respectively. However, the 239+240Pu activities in the
Jinjiang basin were generally higher than those in the Pearl River
Basin. Many factors might affect the distribution of 239+240Pu activities, such as contents of TOC and particle sizes of samples,
riverine input, and estuary experiences (river runoff, tide bores,
coastal currents, and anthropogenic activities (dam-building, oil
exploration, and nuclear power plants)).27,30 Furthermore, the higher 239+240Pu activities in some
estuaries show the transport function of Pu in these river basins,
where Pu is transported from the Chinese continent to estuaries then
to seas by river basins, and the soil erosion in southern China might
have also contributed to this trend. The Pu isotopes absorbed by soil
particles enter rivers along with surface runoff,31,32 and the Pu together with riverine mass finally lead to resuspension
and redeposition of bottom sediments in some areas, particularly the
estuary, coastal zone, marginal sea, and bottom of the ocean.33 Remarkably, the higher 239+240Pu
activities in these estuaries might be affected not only by the source
of Pu from the upstream of these river basins but also by the source
of Pu from the open Pacific.34

In
addition, the activity of 239+240Pu in surface soils
in southern China (<25°) was at 0.03–0.17 mBq/g, with
an average of 0.07 mBq/g.18 Obviously,
the 239+240Pu activities in surface sediments in these
river basins were higher than those in surface soils in southern China
(<25°) (except for samples in Hainan rivers), which was mostly
because the Pu isotopes precipitate with materials in river basins.
And there is input of soils into these river basins due to deposition,
resuspension, and erosion processes, which could also be interpreted
as “source-sink”.23 Moreover,
similar to these river basins in southern China, an increasing number
of research results of Pu in Chinese marginal seas has indicated that
the 239+240Pu activities in seawater and ocean sediments
are evidently higher than those in terrestrial soils in China, which
could also be explained by source-sink.18,24,35,36

240Pu/239Pu Atom Ratio
The 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio can be used as fingerprint
to determine the source of Pu. For example, the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio of global fallout was suggested to be 0.178
± 0.019 in the Northern Hemisphere (0–30°N).15 Unlike the variations in 240+239Pu
activities, the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios in surface
sediments in the Pearl River Basin were 0.165–0.212 (Table S1). The 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios in WGC ranged from 0.163 to 0.221. Samples from the
Jinjiang basin had 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios of
0.167–0.222, and the 240Pu/239Pu atom
ratio in the Minjiang basin was 0.182 ± 0.016. The 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios in the Hainan Province rivers (individual
watershed system) ranged from 0.167 to 0.172, with an average of 0.169
± 0.021, which were well within the value of global fallout (0.178
± 0.019, 0–30°N).

Therefore, most of these 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios in surface sediments agreed
well with the global fallout value (0.178 ± 0.019, 0–30°N)
(Figures 3 and 4). These results were also consistent with previous
studies on the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios in surface
soils in southern China.18−20 Moreover, the major source of
Pu in these surface soils was mainly global fallout. In central and
northern China, similar 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios
have also been reported.18,31,37 However, there was a relatively higher 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio (0.222 ± 0.011) in a surface sediment sample (E25)
upstream of Jinjiang basin, presenting a special “outlier”
of Pu pollution in China (abnormally high 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio), which might be because of the higher TOC content
in this sample (Table S1) (Figures 3 and 5). Unfortunately, there was only data on the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio of one river surface sediment sample, and
it is not yet clear whether this abnormal point was widespread or
merely a sporadic outlier of Pu pollution.

Figure 4 Relationship between 239+240Pu activity and 240Pu/239Pu atom
ratio found in surface sediments of river
basins in southern China. The mean level of the atom ratio is significantly
higher than the mean value of global fallout ratio 0.178 (P = 0.0065), but significantly lower than 0.197, the upper
limit of global fallout ratio (P < 0.0001).

Figure 5 TOC content in surface sediments of river basins in southern
China.

Therefore, these values implied that these places
might have received
Pu with high atom ratio (such as Pu from high-yield thermonuclear
devices) that some samples collected from estuaries of Jinjiang basin
and some places in WGC (which were closed to the South China Sea)
had higher 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios than the
global fallout value (0.178 ± 0.019, 0–30°N) (Figures 3 and 4). In addition, the Pu in the western Pacific with high atom
ratio is mostly from PPG in the Marshall Islands, where large-scale
nuclear tests were carried out during 1952–1958. Moreover,
due to the North Equatorial Current, the Pu from PPG with high atom
ratio (0.30–0.36) enter into China marginal seas and flow into
coastal estuaries along the Kuroshio Current and its extension currents
(Figure S2).24,34,35,38 Previous published
data and some other upcoming data from Liu et al. also observed similar
higher 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios in the Yangtze
River estuary, which indicated that the sources of Pu mainly consisted
of global fallout and the PPG.7,9 The Pu from PPG showed
intense scavenging with sediments in these estuaries, which led to
a higher value of the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio.
Consequently, we could explicitly confirm that the source of Pu in
these estuaries was mainly from global fallout and the PPG, while
the source of Pu in inner river basins was from global fallout.

Until now, both the Pu isotope activity and the Pu atom ratio in
surface sediments of river basins in southern China has shown the
baseline and can fill in the knowledge gap of Pu, which has hitherto
existed in the major river systems in southern China. These data can
also provide a reference for Pu transport and pollution control in
other river basins in China and basic background data for the planned
and operational nuclear power plants in Chinese river basins (data
for Pu pollution prevention and control for nuclear power plant activities,
nuclear accidents (like the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant),
and previous nuclear weapons tests). If a nuclear accident happens
in the operational nuclear power plants in the coastal zones, it would
affect the entire surrounding coastal area and spread to other seas
with the currents.36,39,40 If a nuclear accident happened in the inner river basins, it might
cause Pu pollution of the whole river system and river sediments throughout
the catchments and affect the whole downstream and coastal zones.
As a result, the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios surrounding
ca. 10–20 km of nuclear power plants would increase, and the
atom ratios downstream would also deviate from the average value of
the global fallout.

Mass Balance of Pu in the Pearl River Estuary
According
to the above discussion results, the source of Pu in the Pearl River
Estuary (PRE) was affected not only by the Pu of riverine input (rivers
of the Pearl River Basin) but also by the Pu from PPG. To calculate
the contributions of Pu from different sources, we used a simple mass
balance model, which is summarized in Figure 6. In this balanced model, the surface area
of the Pearl River Estuary was estimated to be 8.6 × 109 m2 based on Google Earth. In this study, we estimated
the 239+240Pu inventory to be 360 Bq/m2 in the
PRE,11,21 and the total sedimentary deposition of
Pu was calculated to be 3.096 × 1012 Bq. The previous
study has reported that the contributions to the PRE from the PPG
were approximately 30 ± 5%.11 Therefore,
the Pu from PPG in the PRE was calculated to be 7.74 × 1011–10.84 × 1011 Bq, and the rest of
the Pu was from the global fallout of approximately 2.01 × 1012–2.32 × 1012 Bq (70 ± 5%), which
included the Pu of riverine input (rivers of the Pearl River Basin)
and the Pu of direct deposition. Unfortunately, we did not directly
analyze the 239+240Pu inventory in the Pearl River Basin,
so we used the value of the global fallout of 36–88.5 Bq/m2 between 20°N and 30°N to calculate the riverine
input.19,21 Previous studies have reported that the
residence time of Pu in river basins is 800–3000 years,41,42 and the Pearl River Basin is the second largest river basin in China
and contains many dams. Therefore, we took 3000 years as the residence
time of Pu in the Pearl River Basin. The following equation was used
to calculate the Pu of the Pearl River Basin input43 1  where Ad is the
area of the catchment (4.4 × 1011 m2), If is the 239+240Pu inventory (36–88.5
Bq/m2), and fe is the fraction
of Pu eroded in the catchments each year (fe = ln2*3000 years = 2.3 × 10–4 years). The
Pu from the Pearl River Basin was calculated to be 3.64 × 109–8.96 × 109 Bq/year, and the total
Pu input derived from the Pearl River Basin was 2.33 × 1011–5.73 × 1011 Bq during 64 years (1952–2016).
The Pu of direct deposition was approximately 14.39 × 1011–20.89 × 1011 Bq. Therefore, the Pu
percentages from riverine input and direct deposition contributing
to the Pu source in the PRE were approximately 13 ± 5% and 57
± 5%, respectively.

Figure 6 Mass balance of Pu in the Pearl River Estuary.

From the calculated results, we suggested that
the major source
of Pu in the PRE was from the Pu of direct deposition of global fallout.
In contrast, the Pu from river input accounted for a small proportion
to the entire inventory of Pu in the PRE, which might indicate that
the soil erosion in the Pearl River Basin was not very serious. However,
77–80% of the Pu in the Yangtze River estuary was from the
Yangtze River input,44 which was nearly
eight times higher than that in the PRE. Thus, we should pay more

Factors Associated with the Distribution of 239+240Pu Activity
The 239+240Pu activities in surface
sediments of river basins in southern China was much higher than that
in surface soils, and this might be associated with the result of
multiple factors, including (1) the organic matter contents and particle
sizes of surface sediments of river basins, (2) the variable climatic
conditions (rainfall, humidity, wind, etc.), for example, wind and
rain have competing effects on the amounts of resuspended plutonium-containing
material collected,45,46 (3) estuary experiences (such
as river runoff, tide bores, currents, and anthropogenic activities
(dam-building, oil exploration, nuclear power plants)),47 and (4) the material composition of the surface
sediments.

In addition to direct Pu isotope measurements, some
correlation coefficients can be used to estimate the degree of contamination
of the territory by plutonium isotopes. For example, previous studies
have already reported correlations between the activity of plutonium
isotopes and the other radionuclides (144Ce, 103,106Ru, 137Cs, etc.) to estimate the content of plutonium
isotopes in the environment and other radioactive fallout.48−51 The activity of radiocesium is related to clay-sized sediment and
material enriched in organic matter.52,53 However, there
is no significant relationship between 137Cs concentrations
and TOC in sediments.54 Although there
are many correlations between Pu and Cs,13,55 Pu is easily adsorbed on refractory oxides, colloidal particles,
and organic matter,56 and Pu particles
with strong activity are more easily transferred to sediments by sedimentary
particles; thus, Pu has a higher reserve in sediments.57 Therefore, we paid special attention to the
influence of material composition in surface sediments, such as TOC
content, grain size, clay content, and heavy metals. The test results
of the material composition are summarized in Table S1.

Previous studies reported less information
about the content of
TOC and the 239+240Pu activity. In this study, the distribution
of TOC showed that the estuaries had higher contents of TOC in addition
to some other sporadic areas of the river basins. These estuaries
also had higher 239+240Pu activity (Figure 2), which was consistent with the distribution
of TOC. However, not all sporadic areas showed such characteristics,
which might be due to the complexity of the river environment (such
as climatic variation and human activities), and our study river basins
were too broad to agree with all special sporadic areas. In other
words, there was a certain correlation between the 239+240Pu activity and the content of TOC in surface sediments of river
basins (Figure 5).

The study on the relationship between natural soil particles and
Pu isotope has indicated that Pu isotopes are easy to associate with
finer particles because of their large specific surface areas.44,58 In Figure S3, particle components of
surface sediments in these river basins implied that these sediments
existed in different grain sizes and mainly contained coarse particles
(>150 μm) (Table S1). However,
because
of the smaller size of particles absorbing a higher content of Pu
isotopes, in this study, the particle size of these samples was not
the factor affecting the 239+240Pu activities in these
river basins.59 It was also noteworthy
that 239+240Pu activities were essentially uncorrelated
with particle components. This result might be due to the less content
of clay particles in study samples.

Because heavy metals are
difficult to be removed from water by
self-purification, they are considered as a kind of pollutants with
high ecological significance in environment.60,61 Although Pu isotope testing techniques are developing rapidly, some
properties of Pu isotopes are not well known.37,62−64 We had some reported data on some heavy metals (V,
Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Cd, Sn, Tl, Pb, Mn) in the surface sediments
that were collected from our study river basins in southern China.65Figure S4 clearly
showed that most heavy metals were unrelated to the distribution of 239+240Pu activity. Only heavy metal As demonstrated consistent
associations with the distribution of 239+240Pu activity,
and the correlation coefficient was 0.69 (Figure S5). This correlation might mean that samples with higher As
content would have higher 239+240Pu activity.

In
addition, the 239+240Pu activities in surface sediments
of river basins were significantly higher than those in surface soils
in southern China, suggesting that there are other important factors
besides particle components, particle sizes, organic matter, and heavy
metal contents that control Pu activity in surface sediments in our
investigated areas. These factors could include the chemical properties
of the sediment (pH, other inorganic ion concentrations), root water
uptake, and biological effect.66 The influence
of these factors on the activity of 239+240Pu in the surface
sediments of the basin remains to be further studied in detail.

Conclusions
The spatial distribution of the 239+240Pu activity in
surface sediments confirmed that it was nonuniform for 239+240Pu activity in major river basins in southern China. Due to riverine
transport of masses of Pu isotopes into seas and the effect of Pu
from the open Pacific, estuaries reserved higher 239+240Pu activities, and the spatial distribution of 239+240Pu activity showed an increasing trend from the upstream and midstream
regions to the estuaries of these river basins. The distribution of
atom ratios implied that the Pu source of the inner river basins was
mainly global fallout, while the Pu sources in river estuaries were
a mix of global fallout and the PPG. The mass balance model revealed
that the major source of Pu in the PRE was from direct deposition
(57 ± 5%), and the Pu input to the Pearl River Basin was only
13 ± 5%. By analyzing the particle components of surface sediments,
we concluded that only the content of TOC and the heavy metal As had
a certain correlation with the 239+240Pu activity. Sediment
components, particle sizes, and contents of heavy metals (except As)
had no connection with the 239+240Pu activity.

Samples and Methods
Sample Collection and Sample Preparation
A total of
53 surface sediments in this study were collected from river basins
in southern China in 2016, located 105°–119°E, 18°–26°N
(Figure 1). Sediment
samples were collected by box core recovery and treated by vertical
extrusion using a hydraulic jack from river bed, with top 3 cm sediments.
These samples included 30 samples from the Pearl River Basin (Beijing,
Dongjiang, Hanjiang, Xijiang), 11 samples from WGC, eight samples
from Jinjiang basin, one sample from Minjiang basin, and three samples
from some rivers in Hainan Province. The regions of these samples
were within inner river basins and estuaries, and the samples were
packed into clean polypropylene sample bags and then kept in a 4 °C
refrigerator until analysis. The detailed site information and sample
properties are shown in Table S1.

Clay Content and TOC Content Analysis
Separated sample
aliquot (2 g) from each sample was tested to determine the grain size
using a Master-size 2000 (Malvern Instruments, U.K.). Carbonate-free
samples (decalcified using 2 M HCl) were used for total organic carbon
(TOC) measurements. The TOC was determined using an elemental analyzer
(Heraeus, Germany) and a set of tyrosine standards were used to calibrate
the TOC concentrations. The measurements of particle size and TOC
were completed in the laboratory of Nanjing University, and the relative
errors of the test were within ±3%.

Pu Isotope Measurement
After the analysis of particle
sizes and TOC, these surface sediments were dried in an 80° oven
and crushed in an agate mortar to prepare for Pu isotopes analyses.
The detailed experiments regarding the separation of Pu isotopes and
its analytical methods have been previously described.25 First, we weighed 2.5 g of each sample in a
Teflon cup and added 1.14 pg 242Pu as a chemical yield
tracer. The Pu was extracted from samples by heating sample solutions
on a hot plate at 200 °C for 4 h using 8 M HNO3. Subsequently,
the sample solutions were filtered with AG 1-x8 and AG MP-1 M anion-exchange
resins to purify Pu isotopes. The final purified liquids were evaporated
to almost dryness and were volume to 1 mL with 4% HNO3.
Then, an APEX-Q sample introduction system with a membrane desolvation
unit (ACM) and a conical concentric nebulizer were together used as
sample introduction systems to improve the sensitivity of sector field
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS). The total
recovery of Pu in these sample solutions was 80–95% and the
average recovery was 87 ± 3%. A certified Pu isotope standard
solution (NBS-947) was used for mass deviation correction.25

The Pu isotope measurement was completed
in the Key Laboratory of Radiation Medicine and Protection at Soochow
University, Suzhou, China. Relative standard deviations of the replicate
analyses were all within ±5%.
