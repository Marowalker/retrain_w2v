Introduction
Vinylsilanes are considered
as important building blocks in organic
synthesis. Owing to their α-, β-, and γ-silicon
effects, they stabilize the carbocation much more than the unsilylated
analogues and undergo regio-specific electrophilic substitution reactions.1 They have been utilized in construction of five-,
six-, seven-, eight-, and nine-membered oxacycles using various methodologies,
among them oxonium-ene cyclization2 and
Prins cyclization3 are notable. They are
also used in the synthesis of various carbocycles.4 Interestingly, these heterocyclic ring systems are core
units of many biologically active molecules5 and natural products.6 Overman and co-workers
demonstrated the use of vinylsilanes for the regio-selective synthesis
of five-, six-, seven-,7 eight-, and nine-membered
oxacycles via oxonium-ene cyclization reaction.2 The same procedure has been used for the synthesis of eight-membered
(−)-laurenyne natural product.8 Goeke
and co-workers used this species for the synthesis of macrolides.9 In this case, the α-silicon effect and
steric factor are considered to be the deciding factor for the formation
of macrolides. Dobbs and co-workers studied the applicability of vinylsilanes
toward the synthesis of indolizidine and quinolizidine derivatives.10 They have also developed methodologies for the
regio-selective synthesis of dihydropyrans using vinylsilanes via
Prins cyclization reactions.3 Other methods
for the generation of dihydropyrans using vinylsilane include Hinkle’s
Lewis acid-initiated addition/silyl-Prins cyclization11 and Speckamp’s vinylsilane-terminated cyclization
of ester-substituted oxycarbenium ion intermediates.12 The formation of regio-selective dihydropyrans is believed
to be the β-silicon effect.3 The
drawback of the existing methods are the formation of silylated oxacycles
which needs to be removed in the subsequent steps2,8 and
formation of diastereomers.11a,12 Therefore, there is
an urgent need for development of highly regio- and diastereo-selective
methodologies for the synthesis of oxacycles. In this communication,
we report a synthesis of dihydropyrans via oxonium-ene cyclization
using vinylsilanes and aldehydes mediated by borontrifluoride etherate
(BF3·OEt2) in good yields with excellent
regio- and diastereo-selectivity. Oxonium-ene reaction is gaining
importance in organic synthesis because of its ability to form carbon–carbon
and carbon–heteoatom bonds in a single step and its diastereo
selectivity.13

Results and Discussion
As part of our continuing efforts to explore the diastereo- and
regio-selective synthesis of oxacycles,14 we envisioned that Prins cyclization of silyl-homoallyl alcohol 1a and aldehyde 2a would give intermediate carbocation 3, which after subsequent elimination of α-protons will
generate regio-isomeric silylated dihydropyrans 4a (Scheme 1). However, in contrast,
dihydropyran 5a was obtained as a single regio-isomer
in 50% yield. In order to increase the yield, the reaction was performed
under different reaction conditions, which are summarized in Table 1; when the reaction
was performed at −45 °C, the yield increased to 72% (Table 1, entry 2). InCl3 in dichloromethane and dichloroethane gave 50 and 45% yields,
respectively (Table 1, entries 3–4). On the other hand, with In(OTf)3 produced 65% yield (Table 1, entry 5). FeCl3 furnished only 40% yield (Table 1, entry 6), whereas
CeCl3·7H2O at 80 °C in CH3CN did not give any products but starting material was recovered
(Table 1, entry 7).
Bronsted acids TfOH and p-TSA were proved to be inappropriate
for the reaction (Table 1, entries 8–9). SnCl4 with 10 mol % gave only 45%
along with silylated product 4a (Table 1, entry 10).

With these optimized reaction conditions,
the scope of the reaction
was further tested using primary alcohols 1a and aldehydes 2a–k as substrates, and the results are summarized
in Table 2. As seen
from the Table 2, the
reaction shows wide applicability to various aldehydes including aryl
aldehydes having electron-donating (Table 2, 5c–d) and electron-withdrawing
groups (Table 2, 5b, 5e–j) on the aromatic ring. 2-Naphthaldehyde
was also found to be effective for this reaction (Table 2, 5k). The reaction
with aliphatic aldehydes (Table 2, 5l–m) gave a regio-isomeric mixture
with a ratio of 62:38 and 63:37 in moderate yields. Alkyl-substituted
secondary silylated alcohols 1b–c also gave good
yields with high diastereo selectivity (Table 2, 5n–5q) under these
reaction conditions, whereas reaction of arylated secondary silylated
alcohol 1d with aldehyde 2i gave a mixture
of two regio-isomers 5r with a ratio of 80:20 and 60%
overall yield. The stereochemistry of the products was determined
from crude 1H NMR and X-ray crystallographic analysis of
compound 5h.15 The cis-configuration
of the 2,6-disubstituted compounds was determined by the 2-D nuclear
Overhauser effect experiment of compound 5o. It may be
noted that the structure and stereochemistry of the products are in
contrast to the product obtained by Overman from SnCl4-mediated
cyclization of acetal vinylsilanes,2,7 where silylated
oxacycles and oxacycles having exocyclic double bonds were formed.
The position of the double bond of the present reaction is also different
from the products of Dobbs as well.3 The
remarkable feature of this reaction is the configurational control
of the vinylsilane for the exclusive formation of 3,6-dihydro-2H-pyran in most of the cases.

of Dihydropyrans
a Yields refer to

b Ratio is
determined from 1H NMR.

As far as the mechanism is concerned, it is believed
that the reaction
proceeds via oxonium-ene cyclization reaction. Lewis acid activates
the carbonyl group for the nucleophilic attack by alcohol to generate
oxocarbenium ion D which forms a six-membered transition
state with hydrogen at C-3. The species D after oxonium-ene
cyclization reaction followed by elimination of protons gives silylated
dihydropyrans E. Finally, the removal of the silyl group
by in situ-generated HF acid gives the final product 5 (Scheme 2). The formation
of the mixture of regio-isomers in the case of 5l–m and 5r can be explained with the help of Claisen rearrangement
of intermediate D. Here, intermediate D undergoes
Claisen rearrangement to give intermediate F, which after
oxonium-ene cyclization reaction gives intermediate G. G eliminates a proton to give silylated dihydropyran 4′ which after desilylation with HF produce dihydropyran 5′. This mechanism is less probable as the newly formed
oxocarbenium ion F is less stabilized by the H (Table 2, entries 1–13)
group compared to Me and Et groups (Table 2, entries 14–17).

Scheme 2 Oxonium-ene Mechanism
The formation of regio-isomeric
compounds 5l–m and 5r could also
be explained as follows. Carbocation 3 formed after cyclization
may eliminate protons via pathways
“a” and “b” to give silylated intermediate 4 as a regio-isomeric mixture, which after desilylation by
HF acid gives regio-isomeric compounds 5 (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Stepwise Mechanism
for the Formation of the Regio-isomeric Mixture
The reaction is not proceeded via classical
Prins cyclization reaction
because carbenium ion 3 (Scheme 1), formed during the reaction, is destabilized
because of the α-silicon effect, which is attributed to poor
ability of the Si–C bond to undergo hyperconjugation.9,16 Therefore, it proceeded via oxonium-ene cyclization reaction. Another
possibility of formation of dihydropyrans is via acyclic-ene reaction
as shown in Scheme 4. The ene reaction between aldehydes and triethylsilyl homoallylic
alcohols generates diol 6, which after reaction with
BF3·OEt2 forms carbenium ion 7. The nucleophilic attack of carbenium ion 7 by the
alcoholic group via SN1 type reaction will produce 5 as a diastereomeric mixture. Therefore, this mechanism is
ruled out, although it supports the formation of single regio-isomer.

Scheme 4 Acyclic-ene Mechanism
In order to prove the mechanism, a controlled reaction
was performed.
Thus, alcohol 1a (1.0 mmol) was reacted with benzaldehyde
(1.0 mmol) in the presence of BF3·OEt2 (1.2
mmol) at −80 °C for 4 h. It was observed that 15% of silylated
compound 4a was obtained along with 50% of 5a (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Controlled
Reaction of 1a and Benzaldehyde
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a methodology
for the synthesis of
dihydropyrans from silyl-homoallylic alcohols and aldehydes in moderate
to good yields. The reaction proceeds via concerted oxonium-ene and
stepwise oxonium-ene reactions. The oxonium-ene cyclization process
provides single regio-isomeric products, whereas stepwise oxonium-ene
reaction gives a mixture of regio-isomers. The reaction is also diastereo-selective.
The drawback of the reaction is that it gives the regio-isomeric mixture
with aliphatic aldehydes and aromatic-substituted secondary homoallylic
alcohols.

Experimental Section
General Information
All the reagents
were of the reagent
grade (AR grade) and were used as purchased without further purification.
Silica gel (60–120 mesh size) was used for column chromatography.
Reactions were monitored by TLC on silica gel GF254 (0.25
mm). Melting points were recorded in an open capillary tube and are
uncorrected. Fourier transform infrared spectra were recorded as neat
liquid or KBr pellets. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard for 1H (600 MHz, 400 MHz) or 13C (150 MHz, 100 MHz) NMR. Chemical
shifts (δ) are reported in ppm, and spin–spin coupling
constants (J) are given in hertz. HRMS spectra were
recorded using a Q-TOF mass spectrometer.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Starting Material 1a–1d
To a solution of [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (5 mol %) in CH2Cl2 (3 mL) was added
triethylsilane (1.3 mmol), and the mixture
was stirred for 15 min at 45 °C before addition of homopropargyl
derivatives (1.0 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at the same
temperature for 2.5 h under a N2 atmosphere. After evaporation
of the solvent under reduced pressure, the crude mixture was chromatographed
on silica gel using ethyl acetate and hexane as eluents to afford
the desired compounds.17

General Procedure
for the Synthesis of Dihydropyrans (5a–5r)
To a solution of vinylsilane (0.5 mmol)
in CH2Cl2 (3 mL) was added aldehyde (0.55 mmol),
followed by BF3·OEt2 (0.6 mmol) at −45
°C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred
at the same temperature for around 4–5 h. After completion
of the reaction, as determined by TLC, the reaction mixture was brought
to room temperature, diluted with CH2Cl2 (10
mL), washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate and brine solutions,
and dried (Na2SO4). Evaporation of the solvent
gave the crude product, which was purified by column chromatography
using ethyl acetate and hexane as eluents.

Procedure for Controlled Reaction
To a mixture of benzaldehyde
(2a) (63 mg, 0.59 mmol) and 3-(triethylsilyl)but-3-en-1-ol
(1a) (100 mg, 0.54 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (2 mL) at −80 °C was added borontrifluoride etherate
(91 mg, 0.65 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at −80
°C for 4 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC.
After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was warmed
to room temperature and CH2Cl2 was added to
the mixture, which was then washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate
and brine solutions and dried (Na2SO4). Evaporation
of the solvent gave the crude product, which was purified by column
chromatography using ethyl acetate and hexane (hexane/EtOAC; 99:1)
as eluents to give triethyl(2-phenyl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)silane (4a) with 15% yield and 2-phenyl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyran (5a) with 50% yield.
