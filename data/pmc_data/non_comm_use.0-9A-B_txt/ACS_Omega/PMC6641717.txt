A cost-effective
solution-based synthesis route to grow MoSe2 thin films
with vertically aligned atomic layers, thereby
maximally exposing the edge sites on the film surface as well as enhancing
charge transport to the electrode, is demonstrated for hydrogen evolution
reaction. The surface morphologies of thin films are investigated
by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, and transmission
electron microscopy analyses confirm the formation of the vertically
aligned layered structure of MoSe2 in those films, with
supporting evidences obtained by Raman. Additionally, their optical
and compositional properties are investigated by photoluminescence
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and their electrical properties
are evaluated using bottom-gate field-effect transistors. The resultant
pristine MoSe2 thin film exhibited low overpotential of
88 mV (at 10 mA·cm–2) and a noticeably high
exchange current density of 0.845 mA·cm–2 with
excellent stability, which is superior to most of other reported MoS2 or MoSe2-based catalysts, even without any other
strategies such as doping, phase transformation, and integration with
other materials.

==== Body
Introduction
As the interest in
hydrogen (H2) has continuously increased
as a future sustainable energy source because of its high energy density
without environmental pollution,1,2 massive efforts have
been devoted to develop efficient processes for H2 production.
One of the most effective and eco-friendly approaches to produce H2 is hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from electrochemical
water splitting, which utilizes appropriate catalysts.3,4 Platinum (Pt) and its alloys have been acknowledged as the most
active catalyst for this reaction because they can dramatically improve
the energy conversion efficiency by significantly dropping the overpotential
to drive the reaction;5,6 however, their scarcity and high
cost hinder its large-scale use for H2 production. In recent
years, layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 and MoSe2 have received great attention by showing
their potentials as efficient electrocatalysts for the HER,7−41 and their cost-effectiveness, chemical stability, and profusion
further support their extension to future earth-abundant noble-metal-free
electrocatalysts.

Each charge-neutral layer of TMDCs, which
consists of covalently
bonded three atomic sheets (e.g., center Mo- and adjacent two S-sheets
in MoS2), is stacked together by weak out-of-plane van
der Waals interactions to form bulk-state. Therefore, those layered
materials have two types of surfaces, which are terrace sites on the
basal planes and edge sites on the side surfaces, providing highly
anisotropic property including hydrogen adsorption free energy on
each surface, ΔGH, for HER. From
the theoretical studies, in the TMDCs with the conventional semiconducting
2H phase, the basal plane has been known to be electrochemically inert
(ΔGH ≈ 2 eV),42,43 thus limiting the catalytic activity of bulk-state TMDC materials
and having initiated various research efforts to maximally expose
the catalytically active edge site by controlling their nanostructures
to increase the edge to the basal plane ratio;7−16,18 however, all those performances
are still far behind of Pt-based catalysts. Alternatively, improving
the catalytic activity of both basal and edge planes by transforming
semiconducting 2H phase to 1T metallic phase (e.g., lithium intercalation)
has been acknowledged to improve the HER performance of TMDCs,16,17,25,31,39 but the process is cost-ineffective as well
as time-consuming, and the stability of metastable 1T phase would
be an issue to be solved. In addition to increasing the number of
active sites, enhancing the charge transport property of the TMDC-based
catalyst could be another crucial factor to improve the HER performance,
and therefore, approaches such as chemical doping of TMDCs to increase
their inherent conductivity20−22 and constructing hybrid nanostructures
with highly conductive platforms23−39 were demonstrated. However, the overall process could be complicated
with the introduction of the additional materials, also inducing an
increase in cost, compared to that of pristine TMDSs, and the grown
TMDC layers, which were usually parallel to the substrate, had the
inherently high resistance through the basal planes connected by van
der Waals bond, inducing the limited performances.

In this work,
a simple solution-based cost-effective methodology,
which can grow MoSe2 layers vertically aligned on substrates
regardless of their types, maximizing the exposed active edge sites
as well as charge transport property, is realized. MoSe2 has known to have higher intrinsic conductivity with lower conduction
band minimum44 and better hydrogen adsorption
coverage36 than those of MoS2. Consequently, it is proven that the catalytic performances of pristine
MoSe2 thin film having vertically aligned atomic layers
could be significantly improved to produce outstanding HER catalytic
performances with low overpotential of 88 mV at 10 mA·cm–2, an extremely high exchange current density of 0.845
mA·cm–2, and excellent stability, superior
to most of the other reported MoS2 or MoSe2-based
catalysts, even without additional strategies such as doping, phase
transformation, and integration with other materials.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of MoSe2 Thin Film Having Vertically Aligned
Layered Structure
The synthesis of vertically aligned MoSe2 layers was achieved on different substrates (SiO2/Si and Au/Si) using a cost-effective chemical bath deposition (CBD)
method.45 Dissimilar to the traditional
solution-based coating methods such as spin-coating, this approach
can be utilized for various substrates regardless of the type, shape,
and size. As shown in Figure 1a–c, the substrates were immersed in the precursor
solution containing ammonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24) and selenium dioxide (SeO2), and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4) and ammonia
solution (NH3) were involved in the reaction kinetics to
form clear bath solution without any precipitation. Additionally,
hydrochloric acid (HCl) was utilized to adjust the solution pH. The
prepared MoSe2 thin films were post-annealed at 450 °C
in a Se environment to improve the crystallinity of the MoSe2 layers. The detailed experimental conditions are described in the Methods section. The overall reaction proceeded
as follows (eq 1): 1

films. (a–c) Schematic

In this process, the deposition time played a key
role in the growth
of MoSe2, and it was changed from 1 to 20 min to adjust
the thickness of the MoSe2 thin film. The variation of
surface morphology according to the deposition time was investigated
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy
(AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was further utilized
to unveil the structural information of the MoSe2 layers
within those thin films. SEM images in Figure 2a–e represent that smooth surface
without any agglomerations was firstly formed (e.g., 1 and 5 min samples),
and it evolved into uniformly distributed larger-sized spherical grains
as the deposition time increased. This surface topology was further
confirmed by AFM images (Figure 2k–o), and the thicknesses of MoSe2 thin films were estimated to be approximately 1.8 (1 min), 8.4 (5
min), 16.5 (10 min), 25.7 (15 min), and 33.8 nm (20 min) (inset of Figure 2k–o). This
morphological evolution suggests that the MoSe2 film formation
process follows homogeneous nucleation, producing larger agglomeration
with the increase of the film thickness. The layered structure of
MoSe2, comprising the thin film, was further investigated
by TEM, and densely packed stripes, representing vertically aligned
MoSe2 layers, were observed within the spherical grains
of thin films as shown in Figure 2f–j. From the TEM images, we could also confirm
that the deposition time shorter than 15 min was not enough to grow
the film to be the thickness forming the multiple vertically aligned
stripes. Moreover, the less discernible stripes in 20 min sample show
that MoSe2 layers grow randomly after the optimum deposition
time (15 min), and it is expected that the property of the MoSe2 film would become similar to that of bulk film as its thickness
increases. The surface profile image, with their FFT patterns, is
shown in Figure S1, and the spacing between
the stripes is approximately 6.4–6.5 Å (Table S1), consistent with the interlayer spacing of MoSe2.8,13,29 Because most
part of the thin film was terminated by the catalytically active edge
sites of MoSe2 layers (e.g., 15 min sample), we could expect
efficient catalytic reactions from those thin films.

MoSe2 thin films prepared with different deposition times,

Figure 1d
shows
the vibrational Raman modes of layered MoSe2 thin films.
The Raman profiles exhibited two characteristic phonon modes: one
corresponded to the A1g mode (242.01–242.89 cm–1) associated with the out-of-plane vibration of Se
atoms and the other corresponded to the E2g1 mode (290.41–292.17 cm–1) associated with the in-plane vibration of Mo and Se atoms.46−48 Similar to the previous results in the literature,47,48 A1g and E2g1 peaks exhibited blue and red shift, respectively, as the
thickness increased with the deposition time. The wide range of Raman
spectra in Figure S2 shows that the out-of-plane
vibrational mode A1g peaks are stronger than the characteristic
peaks of the Si substrate (530 cm–1), representing
that the high-quality MoSe2 layers are obtained using our
CBD growth method.47 Moreover, much higher
A1g peak about out-of-plane vibration than E2g1 peak about in-plane
vibration further supports our claim for the vertically aligned MoSe2 layer structures,13 consistent
with the TEM results. The Raman mapping results with respect to the
intensity of A1g and E2g1 mode peaks, obtained at 1 and 15 min-deposited
samples over an area of 10 μm × 10 μm, are shown
in Figure S3, which demonstrates uniform
growth of MoSe2. Additionally, the B2g1 mode, which came from the broken
translation symmetry along the c-axis direction, often found in few-layer
samples, appeared at 352 cm–1 (Figure S2).47,49,50 The crystal structure of MoSe2 was also studied by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns as shown in the inset of Figure 1d, and (002) preferentially
oriented peak was exhibited at 2θ = 13.45°, which is in
agreement with the earlier report.49 The
(002) orientation lattice d-spacing values are estimated
for different thickness MoSe2 films, and they are compared
with the TEM results as shown in Table S1.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the MoSe2 thin
films obtained at the deposition times from 1 to 20 min are shown
in Figure 1e. All spectra
exhibit a broad peak, which can be deconvoluted to two separate peaks,
and especially, those peaks in the thinnest film (1 min deposition),
at 796 nm (1.56 eV) and 721 nm (1.72 eV), are similar to previous
experimental results of A and B excitonic peaks observed in monolayer
MoSe2, respectively.47,51 It has been known that
those direct bandgaps of MoSe2 are due to the quantum confinement
effect in atomically thin MoSe2 layers,52 and large energy splitting of 0.1–0.4 eV in direct
band transition peaks, originated from strong spin–orbit coupling,
has been reported in monolayer TMDCs.48,53,54 Meanwhile, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analysis was performed to measure the binding energies of Mo and Se.
For the 1 min deposited MoSe2, Mo 3d peaks are observed
at 230.9 and 227.7 eV (Figure 1f), which are ascribed to the doublet of Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2, respectively.55 Furthermore, Se 3d XPS deconvoluted spectra revealed that the Se
3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks were at 53.9 and 53.2
eV, respectively (Figure 1g). The detailed XPS peak positions and their intensities
are provided in Table S2. Thicker films also have similar characteristics,
and all the observed results are in highly consistent with the earlier
reported values for MoSe2.47 The XPS survey spectra are shown in Figure S4.

Electrical Property of MoSe2 Thin Films
In order
to evaluate the electrical properties of the MoSe2 thin
films, bottom-gate field-effect transistors (FETs) were fabricated
using those thin films grown on SiO2/Si. Optical images
of the prepared devices are shown in the insets of Figures 3a and S5. The field-effect mobility, μFE, was calculated
from the slope of ΔIDS/ΔVGS fitted to the linear regime of the transfer
curves using the following equation (eq 2): 2  where W is the width
of the
channel (10 μm), L is the length of the channel
(10 μm), Cox is the capacitance
per unit area of the gate dielectric (1.15 × 10–8 F·cm–2), VDS is
the applied drain voltage (VDS = 1 V),
and ΔIDS/ΔVGS is the slope in the linear part of the transfer plot
(IDS–VGS) or transconductance (gm). The gm, μFE, and on/off current
ratio were approximately 2.82 × 10–9 S, 0.24
cm2·V–1·s–1, and 105, respectively, at VDS = 1 V for the lowest-thickness MoSe2 (1 min-grown) FET
(Figure S5a). The values increased to approximately
1.01 × 10–7 S, 8.8 cm2·V–1·s–1, and 105, respectively,
at VDS = 1 V for the higher-thickness
MoSe2 (15 min-grown) FET (Figure 3a,b). For the highest-thickness MoSe2 (20 min-grown) FET (Figure S5b), the gm, μFE, and
on/off current ratio decreased to approximately 6.86 × 10–9 S, 0.59 cm2·V–1·s–1, and 105, respectively, at VDS = 1 V, and this may be due to the nature
of the film becoming the bulk-state. The prepared MoSe2 FETs showed a little lower performance than the chemical vapor deposition-grown
MoSe2 nanosheet-based devices because of the vertically
aligned layered structure, and their electrical properties are expected
to be further improved by applying the suitable processes such as
post-annealing and doping.

at low VDS exhibiting a good linearity.

Application of MoSe2 Thin Films to HER
To
validate the electrocatalytic behavior of the vertically aligned MoSe2 for the HER, MoSe2 was grown on an Au (200 nm)/Si
substrate. Using the standard three-electrode system, the linear sweep
voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves of the samples in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution were recorded with a scan
rate of 2 mV·s–1. Figure 4a shows the LSV curves for the HER activity
of the MoSe2 thin films, grown for various deposition times.
As a reference, a commercially available Pt electrode was compared.
The lowest onset overpotential value at 10 mA·cm–2 (η10mA·cm–2) is found from
the 15 min-grown MoSe2 to be −88 [mV vs reversible
hydrogen electrode (RHE)], which is superior to most of the MoS2 and MoSe2-based HER catalysts,7−41 including those with the dopant,20−22 phase-transformed TMDCs,16,17,25,31,39 and nanohybrid with other materials23−39 (Table 1). This value
increases with a decrease of deposition time because of insufficient
thickness, and the observed onset overpotential values are at −367,
−296, and −185 (mV vs RHE) for 1, 5, and 10 min-grown
MoSe2 films, respectively. It also increases slightly to
−95 (mV vs RHE) for the 20 min-grown sample, and it is believed
that the MoSe2 film in this thickness range has more bulk
nature, which has the reduced conductivity and the decreased number
of active edge site, consequently degrading its electrocatalytic properties.
Additionally, the maximum cathodic current density (j) value of 365 mA·cm–2 (at a overpotential
of 341 mV) was estimated for 15 min-grown MoSe2, which
is superior to that of reference (Pt, 162 mA·cm–2 at a overpotential of 109 mV). The outstanding hydrogen evolution
property of 15 min-grown MoSe2 is revealed by the maximum
“j” value, which is directly proportional
to the amount of evolved hydrogen.14

The Tafel slope values were estimated
from the Tafel plots (Figure 4b). The extracted
lowest slope value was approximately 59.8 mV·dec–1 for the 15 min-deposited MoSe2, suggesting excellent
kinetic behavior, and the value increased with a decrease in deposition
time (107 mV·dec–1 at 10 min, 125 mV·dec–1 at 5 min, and 150 mV·dec–1 at 1 min). Twenty minute-deposited sample also showed a slightly
higher value, 87 mV·dec–1, than the 15 min-deposited
sample. The Tafel slope is an intrinsic characteristic of the electrocatalyst
and calculated by the rate-limiting step of the HER curves.11 From the hydrogen evolution mechanism, this
can be explained by the Volmer reaction, shown in eq 3, followed by the electrochemical
desorption of Hads, known as the Heyrovsky reaction, shown
in eq 4. A recombination
step, Tafel reaction, is also engaged in this process, as expressed
in eq 5. The reactions
are listed as follows: 3   4   5  

The exchange current density (j0),
a crucial parameter in the HER performance, was extracted for all
the samples from the extrapolation of Tafel plots (Figure 4b). Particularly, the 15 min-grown
MoSe2 exhibits a remarkably high j0 of 0.845 mA·cm–2, which is one of
the maximum values among the reported MoS2 and MoSe2-based catalysts,7−41 as presented in Table 1. In earlier reports, Cui et al.13,22 have reported
the vertically aligned MoSe2 layers, but their performances
were much lower than our results. The superior HER parameters from
this work are summarized in Table S3.

To further investigate the interface reactions and electrode kinetics
during the catalytic HER process, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) was performed. From the Nyquist plots in Figure S6, the charge-transfer resistances (RCT) of the MoSe2 deposited for 20, 15, 10,
5, and 1 min were observed at 4.09, 3.61, 6.91, 8.61, and 13.74 Ω,
respectively, and that of the Pt electrode was 20.83 Ω. The
15 and 20 min-grown MoSe2 samples showed much lower RCT values than those deposited for shorter times
and Pt reference (the lowest value was shown from 15 min-grown MoSe2), which was due to the more active site for H+ reduction at the electrode–electrolyte interface. In addition,
the small series resistances (Rs) of all
the MoSe2 samples (3.37 Ω: 20 min, 2.29 Ω:
15 min, 4.51 Ω: 10 min, 4.27 Ω: 5 min, and 3.06 Ω:
1 min), representing efficient electrical contact at the interface
of the electrode with minimized parasitic Ohmic losses, are favorable
for the practical applications.

Besides the HER activity, the
stability is another important criterion
to evaluate the electrocatalytic properties. To investigate the durability
in an acidic environment, long-term cycling tests were conducted. Figure 4c shows that the
performances of the 15 min deposited sample are not noticeably changed
even after 20 h test, indicating its superior electrocatalytic stability
for the long-term HER performance. Moreover, the time versus current
density curve in Figure 4d shows the consistent current generation for the stable hydrogen
molecule production over 20 h at a constant overpotential of −88
mV (15 min deposited MoSe2).

Conclusions
In
this work, vertically aligned MoSe2 layers, maximizing
the accessibility to the active edge sites and charge transport property
simultaneously, were demonstrated by newly designed low-cost solution-based
CBD process. The proposed preparation process is simple, scalable,
and inexpensive, and the applicability to various substrates regardless
of type and shape could offer a boundless opening to the preparation
of layered structures. Even without additional strategies such as
doping, phase transformation, and integration with other materials,
the resultant pristine MoSe2 films exhibited a low overpotential
of 88 mV (at 10 mA·cm–2) and noticeably a high
exchange current density of 0.845 mA·cm–2 with
excellent stability, superior to most of the reported MoS2 and MoSe2-based electrocatalysts in the references. We
believe that the methodology described in this work for superior HER
performance with the long-term stability of MoSe2 catalyst
guides to the development of efficient practical hydrogen production
catalysts.

Methods
Synthesis of Vertically Aligned MoSe2 Layers
The CBD process was utilized to synthesize
MoSe2 thin
films. The precursor solution bath was prepared by 0.03 M ammonium
molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24) and 0.005 M selenium dioxide (SeO2). The hydrazine hydrate
(N2H4, 1.0 M) and ammonia solution (NH3, 4 M) were added to form a clear bath solution without any precipitation.
Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used to control the solution pH (12 ±
0.1). The deposition time was varied to control the thickness of the
MoSe2 films (1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min). SiO2 (300 nm)/Si and Au (200 nm)/Si were utilized as substrates for FET
and HER devices, respectively. The bath temperature was 90 °C.
The prepared MoSe2 layers were subjected to post-annealing
treatment at 450 °C for 60 min in a Se atmosphere.

Characterization
of MoSe2 Films
The Renishaw
inVia Raman microscope (model: RE04) was used to characterize MoSe2 films with a scan speed of 30 s. XRD analysis was conducted
with a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer, using a source of Cu Kα
radiation. XPS analysis was performed using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe
(25 W Al Kα, 6.7 × 10–8 Pa). The room
temperature PL analysis was performed using a HORIBA microspectrometer
with a spot size of 1 μm by the Nd:YAG laser source (532 nm
wavelength). The surface morphology of MoSe2 films was
analyzed using field emission-SEM (JEOL JSM-6700F). Topology and film
thickness were estimated using AFM (Vecco Dimension 3100). The vertically
aligned MoSe2-layered structures were confirmed with a
support of a JEOL-2010F high-resolution transmission electron microscope.
For TEM sample preparation, PMMA was coated onto the as-deposited
MoSe2 sample (on SiO2/Si) and then SiO2 was etched using KOH solution. After etching SiO2, PMMA
with MoSe2 was floated on KOH solution, and it was transferred
to the TEM Cu grid. The transferred sample was cleaned using acetone
to remove poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) for analysis. The FFT and
R-FFT images were extracted using the Gatan DigitalMicrograph (version
3.21).

Electrochemical Measurements
LSV measurements were
performed in the acidic electrolyte solution of 0.5 M H2SO4 (purged with pure N2) with the scan rate
of 2 mV·s–1. The three-electrode system, which
comprised a working electrode (MoSe2-deposited Au), a counter
electrode (graphite rod), and a reference electrode (saturated calomel
electrode), was used for the LSV measurement. Au substrate was utilized
to decrease the Ohmic resistance, and it was shown that the catalytic
property of Au-only substrate was not noticeable.11 The EIS measurements were performed with frequencies ranging
from 105 to 0.1 Hz. The LSV curves were iR-corrected with the Rs values calculated
from the EIS measurement.

Construction of the MoSe2 FET
Devices
The
proposed CBD process was employed to prepare different thicknesses
of MoSe2 films onto SiO2 (300 nm)/Si substrates
for the FET device fabrication. The combination of photolithography
and reactive ion SF6/O2 plasma etching was used
to make the device structure and contact points. Ti/Au (10/50 nm)
was deposited on MoSe2 films onto SiO2 (300
nm)/Si via electron beam evaporation as source/drain (S/D) electrode
patterns. To remove the resist residue affecting the contact resistance,
the prepared devices were annealed at 200 °C for 2 h in a tubular
furnace with the 100 sccm Ar flow after preparing the electrode contacts.
The fabricated MoSe2 transistors were characterized using
a two-probe technique at room temperature in a vacuum chamber to avoid
oxidation.
