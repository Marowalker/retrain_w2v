The full potential energy surface
for the hydrodeoxygenation of
furfural to furan and other ring-opening products has been systematically
investigated using periodic density functional theory including dispersion
corrections (PBE-D3) on the bimetallic NiCuCu(111) surface. For furan
formation, the most favorable first step is the dehydrogenation of
furfural into furoyl (F-CHO + H = F-CO + 2H), the successive step
is decarbonylation of furoyl into furanyl (F-CO + H = F + CO + 2H),
and the third step of furan formation from the hydrogenation of furanyl
(F + CO + 2H = FA + CO + H) is the rate-determining step. In addition,
on the basis of the most stably adsorbed furan and H, the ring opening
of furan was found to be more favorable for producing many chemicals
such as propane, butanal, butanol, and butene. In summary, furan is
the main product of furfural conversion on the NiCuCu(111) surface.
Since results have been obtained only for the NiCuCu(111) surface
constructed by replacing the topmost Cu atoms by Ni atoms, the entire
experimentally observed reactivity and selectivity of bimetallic CuNi
catalysts for different construction methods cannot be fully rationalized.
Nevertheless, the results provide the basis for investigating the
intrinsic activity of CuNi catalysts in the hydrodeoxygenation of
oxygenates involved in the refining of biomass-derived oils.

1 Introduction
The
furfural molecule contains a carbonyl group and furan ring,
which contains two C=C double bonds and one cyclic ether bond.
The furfural molecule, therefore, is highly reactive and can be converted
into many useful chemicals such as furan, tetrahydrofuran, furfuryl
alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and 2-methylfuran through decarbonylation,
hydrogenation, and hydrodeoxygenation. It is a multiply oxygenated
compound usually found in bio-oils and is considered as a key molecule
in biomass conversion, which has been widely studied by researchers.

Experimentally, furfural can be converted to different products
using a variety of catalysts. Reactions involving the use of this
molecule have been extensively studied employing single-metal catalysts
such as Cu,1−5 Ni,6−8 Pd,9−13 Pt,14−18 and Ru.19−22 For example, Sitthisa et al.4 found that
at a low temperature, furfural is hydrogenated mainly to furfuryl
alcohol and a small amount of 2-methylfuran, and the production of
2-methylfuran increases at high temperatures (>200 °C) upon
using
a Cu-based catalyst. Using a Pd-based catalyst,12 a 99.5% production of furan can be achieved in the decarbonylation
of furfural.

Recently, it has been found that after a metal
is doped with another
metal to form a bimetallic catalyst, its activity changes significantly
due to the structural or electronic effects, possibly affording a
new catalyst with higher catalytic performance and broad application
prospects in catalysis.23 Non-noble-metal
bimetallic CuNi catalysts have received widespread attention because
of their low cost.24−29 Lukes et al.24 found as early as in 1951
that furan is the main product in furfural conversion using bimetallic
CuNi (Cu/Ni = 1:1) catalysts at temperatures of more than 200 °C.
Merat’s research team25 and Liu’s
group26 found that furfural hydrogenation
mainly produced tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol with a yield of >90%
employing
the bimetallic catalyst using a Cu/Ni molar ratio of 1/1. Results
obtained by Yang et al. showed that the main product of the furfural
reaction catalyzed by a CuNi bimetallic catalyst in an aqueous solvent
is cyclopentanone.27 Recently, it has been
determined that the properties of CuNi bimetallic catalysts in the
liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural are significantly affected
by the chemical composition of the catalyst as well as the method
and solvent used in the reaction. For example, the optimized CuNi
(Cu/Ni = 1/1) catalyst showed high activity and selectivity for furfural
conversion to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol in ethanol, whereas the main
product converted to furfuryl alcohol in methanol.28

These experimental studies have shown that even for
the same catalyst,
the selectivities and activities of the catalyst are different under
different experimental conditions. This needs to be rationalized on
the basis of the theoretically determined reaction mechanisms. However,
few theoretical studies have been undertaken to investigate the reaction
mechanism of furfural conversion on bimetallic catalysts. Xiong et
al.30 studied only the adsorption configuration
of furfural on CuNi bimetallic catalysts and speculated the possible
reaction mechanism according to the adsorption configuration, but
the specific reaction mechanism has not been clarified.

In this
work, the dispersion-corrected PBE-D3 method was used to
explore the mechanism of furfural conversion to furan as well as the
reaction of furan on the bimetallic NiCuCu(111) surface. On the basis
of the computed kinetic and thermodynamic results, the minimum reaction
path and rate-determining step were identified. In agreement with
the experimental data, the results provide insights into the bimetallic
CuNi-catalyzed selective furfural conversion and broaden the fundamental
understanding of the selective deoxygenation reactions of biomass-derived
oxygenates.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Adsorption
of Intermediates
The top
and side views of the NiCuCu(111) surface are shown in Figure 1. There are four potential
exposed sites for adsorption, i.e., the top (t), bridge (b), 3-fold
face-centered cubic (fcc) site over the third layer of atoms, and
3-fold hexagonal close-packed (hcp) site over the second layer of
atoms.

The adsorptions of the trans and cis configurations of furfural (F-CHO, F = 2-furanyl) as well as furan
(FA), propene (CH3CHCH2), propane (CH3CH2CH3), butanal (R-CHO, R= CH3CH2CH2), butanol (R-CH2OH), butene (R′-CH=CH2, R′ = CH3CH2), and butane (R-CH3) were computed on the NiCuCu(111) surface. The adsorption
configurations and their structural properties are shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, respectively.

For the adsorptions
of cis- and trans-furfural, it was
found that all C and O atoms interacted with the
surface Ni atoms, and the entire molecule was parallel to the surface.
As shown in Figure 1, F-CHO showed an obvious η2(C=O) surface
bonding mode, as the C=O bonds were elongated by 0.087 and
0.097 Å, compared with the corresponding bonds in the gas phase.
The computed adsorption energies of cis- and trans-F-CHO were −1.78 and −1.88 eV, respectively,
significantly larger than those on the Cu(111) surface (−0.88
and −0.91 eV),31 for which F-CHO
showed a η1(O) surface bonding mode. In addition, the values were lower
than those obtained on the Mo2C(101) surface (−2.68
and −2.50 eV),32 for which F-CHO
showed the same η2(C=O) surface bonding mode.

Furthermore, the adsorptions of furan (FA), propene (CH3CHCH2), propane (CH3CH2CH3), butanal (R-CHO), butanol (R-CH2OH), butene (R′-CH=CH2), and butane (R-CH3) were computed. For FA, a
similar adsorption configuration as that of F-CHO was observed and
the computed adsorption energy was −1.42 eV. For propene and
butene, the molecule interacted with the surface mainly through the
C=C bond with one C atom at the fcc site and one C at the top
site, and the adsorption energies were −1.95 and −1.48
eV, respectively. For propane and butane, the molecules were above
the surface with all C atoms over the top sites without direct bonding
interactions, and the adsorption energies were −0.54 and −0.73
eV, respectively. For R-CHO, the molecules contacted the surface mainly
through the C=O bond, and the Ni−O distances were 1.980
and 2.000 Å, the Ni−C distance was 1.967 Å. This
shows that R-CHO exhibited a η2(C=O) surface
bonding mode, where the C=O distance was elongated by 0.152
Å compared with that in the gas phase, and the computed adsorption
energy was −1.08 eV. The most stable adsorption of R-CH2OH contacted with the surface via the O atom and two H atoms,
in which the Ni–O and two Ni–H distances were 2.034,
and 1.895 and 1.872 Å, respectively. The adsorption energy was
−1.03 eV, which was slightly lower than that of R-CHO.

2.1.2 H2 Dissociative Adsorption
As H2 is used in furfural conversion, H2 dissociative
adsorption on the NiCuCu(111) surface was computed for direct comparison
with that on the Cu(111) surface.31 The
adsorption configurations and structural properties are shown in Figure 2. H2 was
adsorbed at the top site, parallel to the surface, and the Ni–H
distances were 1.587 and 1.589 Å, which were much shorter than
those (2.960 and 3.022 Å) on the Cu(111) surface, indicating
stronger adsorption of H2 in this case than on the Cu(111)
surface. In effect, the adsorption energy was −0.61 eV, much
higher than that (−0.08 eV) on the Cu(111) surface.

Figure 2 Potential energy
surface of H2 dissociative adsorption
and H diffusion (energy is in eV, Ni/blue, Cu/orange, H/white).

Starting from the molecularly adsorbed H2 at the top
site, the dissociative adsorption of two H atoms showed a barrier
of only 0.08 eV and was highly exothermic by 1.05 eV, indicating a
thermodynamically and kinetically favorable process. Compared with
the results obtained for the Cu(111) surface,31 it was concluded that H2 dissociative adsorption on the
NiCuCu(111) surface was significantly more favored both kinetically
(0.08 vs 0.59 eV) and thermodynamically (−1.05 vs −0.55
eV). In the transition state TS(H–H), both H atoms were at
the top sites with a H–H distance of 1.156 Å, and the
Ni–H distances were 1.490 and 1.508 Å. For the most stable
co-adsorption of two H atoms, one H atom was at the fcc site and the
other was at the hcp site, and they shared one surface Ni atom, wherein
the distance between the two H atoms was 2.961 Å and the corresponding
Ni–H distances were 1.686, 1.689, and 1.689 Å as well
as 1.685, 1.689, and 1.691 Å.

Furthermore, H diffusion
from one hcp site to the neighboring fcc
site was computed, which had a barrier of only 0.13 eV and was neutral
in terms of reaction energy, indicating the high mobility of surface
H atoms. This result was in close agreement with that observed for
the Cu(111) surface.31 In the transition
state TS(Hhcp–Hfcc), a H atom bridged
the Ni–Ni bond with a Ni–H distance of 1.608 Å.
In addition, the co-adsorption of two H atoms at two remote fcc sites
was less stable by 0.02 eV than that where both H atoms at two neighboring
fcc sites shared one Ni atom. For the adsorption of one H atom, the
computed adsorption energy at the fcc site was slightly higher than
that at the hcp site (the values were −3.25 and −3.23
eV, respectively).

2.2 Mechanisms of Furfural
Conversion
Using the most stably adsorbed trans-F-CHO in the
parallel configuration, the full potential energy surface (PES) for
furfural selective conversion was computed, for which the energy barrier
and reaction energy were computed on the basis of the stable species
without direct co-adsorption interactions. As the adsorption energies
of the H atom on the fcc and hcp sites were very close in value and
the H atom showed high diffusion mobility, a H atom was placed on
either the fcc site or the hcp site for computation, which was close
to the substrates, for finding the transition states. The selected
structural parameters of the IS, TS, and FS, as well as the computed
energy barrier and reaction energy, are included in the Supporting
Information (Tables S1 and S2).

2.2.1 –CH=O Hydrogenation against
Dissociation
For the first reaction route of furfural, five
possible reaction pathways were considered: selective hydrogenation
of the −CH=O group, i.e., (a) hydrogenation of the C
atom of the C=O group (R1, F-CHO + H = F-CH2O) and (b) hydrogenation of the O atom of the C=O group
(R2, F-CHO + H = F-CHOH), and the parallel and competitive
−CH=O dissociation reactions, i.e., (c) direct C–H
dissociation (R3, F-CHO + H = F-CO + 2H), (d) direct
C=O dissociation (R4, F-CHO + H = F-CH + O + H),
and (e) direct −CHO dissociation (R5, F-CHO +
H = F + CHO + H). The optimized structures of the adsorbed intermediates
are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). The full PES was plotted on the basis of a step-by-step
comparison (Figure 3), i.e., searching all possible pathways for a given adsorbed species
gained from the previous step and continuing with only the reaction
pathways with the lowest reaction barriers while abandoning those
with clear high barriers.

Figure 3 Potential energy surfaces (in eV) for the reaction
routes of R1–R7 on the NiCuCu(111)
surface (F =
2-furanyl).

In the reaction step R1, a H atom was added to the
C atom of the C=O group, leading to a F-CH2O intermediate.
In the co-adsorbed structure (IS1), the H atom was located
at the hcp site in the vicinity of the −CH=O group with
Ni–H distances of 1.665, 1.673, and 1.711 Å. In the transition
state (TS1), the H atom moved to the top site and the
forming C6–H distance observed was 1.551 Å. In the final
state (FS1), the adsorption of the C6 atom occurred away
from the surface and the O7 was at the bridge site with Ni–O
distances of 1.934 and 1.938 Å. The computed energy barrier was
0.89 eV, and the reaction was endothermic by 0.40 eV. The alternative
reaction route to R1 was the H addition to the O atom
of the C=O group, resulting in a F-CHOH intermediate. In the
transition state (TS2), the forming O7–H distance
was 1.378 Å and the H atom was at the bridge site away from the
original hcp site. The energy barrier was 0.85 eV, and the reaction
was endothermic by 0.42 eV. This indicated that F-CH2O
and F-CHOH formations were parallel and were both kinetically (0.89
vs 0.85) and thermodynamically (0.40 vs 0.42 eV) competitive.

The parallel and competitive reactions of −HC=O hydrogenation
are direct C–H, C=O, and CHO dissociations. In the R3 step (F-CHO + H = F-CO + 2H), F-CHO dissociated into F-CO
and H. In the transition state (TS3), the C6–H
breaking distance was 1.690 Å and H moved to the top site with
a Ni–H distance of 1.512 Å. The energy barrier was 0.42
eV, and the reaction energy was −0.13 eV. For F-CHO dissociation
into F-CH and O (R4), the transition state (TS4) and the final state (FS4) were computed. In TS4, the O atom moved from the top site to the bridge site,
and the C6–O7 breaking distance was 1.822 Å. The energy
barrier was 1.32 eV, and the reaction energy was −0.42 eV.
For direct CHO dissociation (R5, F-CHO + H = F + CHO
+ H), the energy barrier was 1.11 eV and the reaction energy was 0.50
eV. As shown in Figure 3, all of these results clearly demonstrate that direct C–H
dissociation involves the lowest energy barrier and is most kinetically
favorable. Therefore, the co-adsorption of surface F-CO and H was
used to discuss the furan formation.

2.2.2 Furan
Formation
Starting from the
most stable co-adsorption of F-CO and H, CO dissociation (R6, F-CO + 2H = F + CO + 2H) was first computed. In the transition
state TS6, the C–C breaking distance was 1.876
Å and the O atom of the CO group was away from the surface. In
the final state (FS6), the CO molecule formed was almost
perpendicular to the surface with the C atom located at the fcc site,
and the Ni–C distances were 1.921, 1.925, and 1.918 Å.
The computed energy barrier was 0.63 eV, and the reaction was exothermic
by 0.70 eV. Second, on the basis of the most stable co-adsorbed F
+ CO + 2H, furan formation was computed (R7, F + CO +
2H = FA + CO + H). The forming C–H distance determined was
1.763 Å for TS7. In FS7, furan and
CO were as far away from each other as possible without direct co-adsorption.
The energy barrier was 0.76 eV, and the reaction energy was −0.33
eV. As shown in Figure 3, on the NiCuCu(111) surface, furan formation was both kinetically
and thermodynamically facile. In the following sections, the hydrogenation
and ring opening of furan will be discussed.

2.2.3 Propene
and Propane Formation
On
the basis of the co-adsorption of furan and H, the hydrogenation and
ring opening of the furan ring were computed. The optimized structures
of the adsorbed intermediates are shown in the Supporting Information
(Figure S2), and the potential energy surface
is shown in Figure 4. For the hydrogenation reaction, there are two possible reaction
routes: a H atom is added either to the C2 atom (R8,
FA + H = FA-C2H) or to the C3 atom (R9, FA + H = FA-C3H),
as C5 and C4 atoms are equivalent to C2 and C3 atoms, respectively.
The computed results show that the energy barriers of R8 and R9 are
very close (0.93 and 0.95 eV, respectively), and the reaction energies
are 0.57 and 0.73 eV, respectively. This result implies that hydrogenation
of the C2 atom is slightly more favored than that of the C3 atom kinetically
(0.93 vs 0.95 eV) and thermodynamically (0.57 vs 0.73 eV) and therefore
the steps should be competitive.

the reaction routes of R8–R11 and R18–R22 on the NiCuCu(111) surface.

In addition, starting from the most stable adsorption
of furan
and H as the initial state (IS10), the ring opening of
furan (R10, FA + H = C4H4O + H)
was computed. In the transition state (TS10), the C5–O1
breaking distance was 1.839 Å. The computed energy barrier was
only 0.41 eV, and the reaction was exothermic by 0.59 eV. Compared
with the hydrogenation of the furan ring, the C–O breakage
was much more kinetically (0.41 vs 0.93 and 0.95 eV) and thermodynamically
(−0.59 vs 0.57 and 0.73 eV) favored. Therefore, surface C4H4O + H was used for the subsequent reaction.

First, on the basis of the most stable adsorption of C4H4O + H, the dissociation of CHO into C3H3 + CHO + H (R11, C4H4O
+ H = C3H3 + CHO + H) was computed. In the transition
state (TS11), the C–C breaking distance was 1.961
Å. In FS11, the dissociated CHO group was at the
fcc site owing to the interaction between Ni and C as well as that
between Ni and O. The energy barrier was 0.67 eV, and the reaction
was endothermic by 0.19 eV. Second, starting from the co-adsorbed
C3H3 + CHO + H, the hydrogenation of C3H3 and dehydrogenation of CHO were calculated separately.
The computed results indicated no transition state in the dehydrogenation
of CHO into CO + H (C3H3 + CHO + H = C3H3 + CO + 2H) as the structure with a reasonable C–H
distance showed a lower energy than that of the initial state. This
implied that CHO dissociation into CO + H was spontaneous and highly
exothermic by 1.41 eV. With respect to the hydrogenation of C3H3, there are two competitive and parallel pathways:
H addition to the C1 atom leading to CH2CHCH (R12, C3H3 + 2H + CO = CH2CHCH + H +
CO) and H addition to the C2 atom resulting in CHCH2CH
(R13, C3H3 + 2H + CO = CHCH2CH + H + CO), as the C3 atom is the same as the C1 atom. As
shown in Figures 5 and S3, CH2CHCH formation involved a lower
barrier (0.60 vs 1.20 eV) and reaction energy (0.16 vs 0.59 eV) than
CHCH2CH formation. It was concluded that as the reaction
energy increases, the energy barrier increases. Therefore, only the
step showing the lowest reaction energy was considered in the subsequent
hydrogenation of CH2CHCH.

Figure 5 Potential energy surfaces (in eV) for
the reaction routes of R12–R17 on
the NiCuCu(111) surface.

Following the hydrogenation
of the C1 atom leading to CH2CHCH, the H addition to the
C3 atom leading to CH2CHCH2 (R14, CH2CHCH + H + CO = CH2CHCH2 +
CO) was computed as it had a lower reaction energy
than that of hydrogenation of C1 (CH2CHCH + H + CO = CH3CHCH + CO) and C2 (CH2CHCH + H + CO = CH2CH2CH + CO) atoms (0.06 vs 0.46 and 0.68 eV). The computed
results indicated that hydrogenation of the C3 atom had the lowest
barrier (0.49 vs 1.00 and 1.04 eV, Figure S7).

On the basis of the most stable adsorption of CH2CHCH2 + CO, the co-adsorption of one H atom as the initial
state
(IS15) was computed and two parallel and competitive
pathways were considered: the hydrogenation of C1 leading to propene
(R15, CH2CHCH2 + H + CO = CH3CHCH2 + CO) and the C2 atom resulting in the CH2CH2CH2 intermediate (CH2CHCH2 + H + CO = CH2CH2CH2 + CO).
It was found that the reaction energy of propene formation was lower
than that of CH2CH2CH2 formation
(0.44 vs 0.68 eV, Figure S7); therefore,
the transition state of propene formation (TS15) was
located where H moved to the top site from the original fcc site and
the forming C–H distance was 1.510 Å, and the computed
barrier was 0.95 eV. Subsequently, the adsorption energies of CH3CH2CH2 owing to H addition to the C2
atom (R16, CH3CHCH2 + H + CO =
CH3CH2CH2 + CO) and CH3CHCH3 owing to H addition to the C3 atom (CH3CHCH2 + H + CO = CH3CHCH3 + CO)
were computed, and it was determined that the formation of CH3CH2CH2 required a lower energy (0.25
vs 0.60 eV, Figure S7) than that of CH3CHCH3. The computed energy barrier of CH3CH2CH2 formation was only 0.29 eV, indicating
that it was the kinetically favorable step. The last step of propane
formation was the hydrogenation of the C2 atom (R17,
CH3CH2CH2 + H + CO = CH3CH2CH3 + CO), which showed a barrier of 1.00
eV, and the reaction was endothermic by 0.12 eV.

2.2.4 Butanal Formation
The alternative
way to CHO dissociation is the hydrogenation of C4H4O. On the basis of the most stable adsorbed C4H4O, the co-adsorption of one H atom in the initial state (C4H4O + H) was computed for the following parallel
and competitive pathways: the hydrogenation of the O atom or the four
other C atoms leading to C4H4-OH (R18, C4H4O + H = C4H4-OH)
or C4H5O (R19, C4H4O + H = C3H3O-C2H2; R20, C4H4O + H = C3H3O-C3H2; R21, C4H4O + H = C3H3O-C4H2; R22, C4H4O + H = C3H3O-C5H2), respectively. The optimized structures are given in the
Supporting Information (Figure S4), and
the potential energy surface is also shown in Figure 4. Starting from the co-adsorbed C4H4O and H, the C4H4-OH intermediate
was computed. In TS18, the forming O–H distance
was 1.441 Å, the energy barrier was 0.96 eV, and the reaction
energy was 0.58 eV. For the hydrogenation of four C atoms, the energy
barrier was found to be 1.02, 1.05, 0.94, and 0.79 eV, and the reaction
energies were 0.84, 0.84, 0.78, and 0.34 eV for the formation of C3H3O-C2H2, C3H3O-C3H2, C3H3O-C4H2, and
C3H3O-C5H2, respectively. As expected,
the hydrogenation of the C5 atom was the most favored, both kinetically
(0.79 vs 1.02, 1.05, 0.94, and 0.96 eV) and thermodynamically (0.34
vs 0.84, 0.84, 0.78, and 0.58 eV). Under hydrogenation-rich conditions,
it can be assumed that hydrogenation of the C5 atom and CHO dissociation
should be competitive, although CHO dissociation is slightly more
favored kinetically (0.67 vs 0.79 eV) and thermodynamically (0.19
vs 0.34 eV). In addition, the result showed that the most favored
hydrogenation of the C4H4O intermediate occurred
at the C atom, which was the farthest away from the −CHO group.
Therefore, the hydrogenation of the C atom distant from the −CHO
group was considered stepwise. The optimized structures are also given
in the Supporting Information (Figure S4), and the potential energy surface is given in Figure 6.

(in eV) for the reaction routes of R23–R25 on the NiCuCu(111) surface.

First, the second H addition to the C5 atom leading to the formation
of the C3H3O-C5H3 intermediate (R23, C3H3O-C5H2 + H = C3H3O-C5H3) was computed; the energy barrier
was found to be 0.83 eV, and the reaction was endothermic by 0.44
eV. As shown in the SI (Figure S7), the
hydrogenation of the other three C atoms and the O atom was neither
kinetically (0.83 vs 0.91, 1.10, 0.95, and 1.06 eV, respectively)
nor thermodynamically (0.44 vs 0.69, 0.80, 0.77, and 0.51 eV, respectively)
favored when compared with the hydrogenation of the C5 atom.

Second, starting from the co-adsorption of C3H3O-C5H3 and the H atom, the hydrogenation of the C4 atom
was computed (R24, C3H3O-C5H3 + H = CH3CH2CHCHO). The energy barrier
and reaction energy were 0.59 and 0.54 eV, respectively. Finally,
butanal (R-CHO) was formed by the hydrogenation of the C3 atom (R25, CH3CH2CHCHO + H = R-CHO), with
an energy barrier of 0.59 eV and a reaction energy of 0.21 eV.

2.2.5 Butanol and Butene Formation
On
the basis of the most stable adsorption configuration of butanal and
one H atom, the hydrogenation and dissociation of the CHO group according
to the following pathways were considered: (a) the hydrogenation of
the C atom of the C=O group (R26, R-CHO + H =
R-CH2O), (b) the hydrogenation of the O atom of the C=O
group (R27, R-CHO + H = R-CHOH), and (c) direct −CHO
dissociation (R28, R-CHO + H = R + CHO + H). The optimized
structures are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S5), and the energy profile is given in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Potential energy surfaces
(in eV) for the reaction routes of R26–R30 on the NiCuCu(111) surface.

On the basis of the co-adsorbed R-CHO + H, the hydrogenation of
C and O atom of the CHO group was calculated. H addition to the C
atom leading to the R-CH2O intermediate was much more kinetically
(0.59 vs 0.81 eV) and thermodynamically (−0.10 vs 0.46 eV)
favored than R-CHOH formation. In addition, direct CHO dissociation
was less favored kinetically (1.10 vs 0.59 eV) than R-CH2O formation. As shown in Figure 7, the hydrogenation of the C atom resulting in R-CH2O was the most favorable for the first reaction step of butanal.
Therefore, the surface R-CH2O was used for the formation
of butanol (R-CH2OH).

Starting from the most stable
adsorbed R-CH2O, the co-adsorption
structure of one H atom was computed, and two competitive pathways were considered: the hydrogenation
of O atom (R29, R-CH2O + H = R-CH2OH) and direct C–O dissociation (R30, R-CH2O + H = R-CH2 + O + H). The computed results show
that R-CH2OH formation was slightly more favored kinetically
(1.13 vs 1.23 eV) than C–O direct dissociation into R-CH2 + O. Therefore, the most stable surface species was R-CH2OH, which was used for the subsequent reaction.

On the
basis of the most stable adsorption of R-CH2OH,
the direct OH dissociation was computed (R31, R-CH2OH = R-CH2 + OH). In TS31, the C–O
breaking distance was 2.320 Å, and the OH group was at the bridge
site with Ni–O distances of 1.891 and 2.330 Å. The computed
energy barrier was 1.57 eV, and the reaction was exothermic by 0.45
eV. Starting from the co-adsorbed R-CH2 + OH + H as the
initial state, the parallel and competitive reaction pathways of butane
formation (R32, R-CH2 + OH + H = R-CH3 + OH), H2O formation (R33, R-CH2 + OH + H = R-CH2 + H2O), and butene
formation (R34, R-CH2 + OH + H = R′-CH=CH2 + 2H + OH) were computed. As shown in Figures 8 and S6, the formation
of butene from β-H elimination was much more favored, both kinetically
(0.07 vs 0.87 and 1.10 eV) and thermodynamically (−0.44 vs
0.12 and 0.50 eV), than butane and H2O formation. Therefore,
the main product should be butene rather than butane. Nevertheless,
butane formation is also possible under hydrogenation-rich conditions
as it has a relatively low barrier of 0.87 eV and is slightly endothermic
by 0.12 eV.

Finally, the formation of H2O (R35, R′-CH=CH2 + 2H + OH = R′-CH=CH2 + H + H2O) was computed on the NiCuCu(111) surface
after the formation
and desorption of butene. The computed energy barrier was 1.09 eV,
and the reaction was endothermic by 0.51 eV.

2.2.6 Potential
Energy Surface
On the
basis of the above results and the full potential energy surfaces
(Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8), the formation
of the intermediates and the rate-determining step for the overall
reaction would be interesting to investigate. In addition, to explain
the selective conversion of furfural, the rate constants (k) were computed on the basis of the transition-state theory,33,34 which was used in my previous work.32 The computed energy barrier and reaction energy as well as the rate
constant of furan formation are included in Table 2.

As shown in Figure 3, for the first step of the F-CHO reaction,
C–H direct dissociation
was the most favorable pathway as it had a lower barrier than that
of the hydrogenation of C and O atoms as well as direct C=O
and CHO dissociations (0.42 vs 0.89, 0.85, 1.32, and 1.11 eV, respectively).
In addition, the computed rate constants also revealed that F-CHO
dissociation into F-CO + H was the fastest, and the rate constant
at 473 K was as high as 2.71 × 108, which was much
higher than that of the other four reaction pathways (2.71 ×
108 vs 2.44 × 103, 8.94 × 103, 4.63 × 10–2, and 2.30 × 101). In the subsequent reaction of FA formation starting from the surface
F-CO + H, CO dissociation had a barrier of 0.63 eV, and the last step
of FA formation with the highest energy barrier (0.76 eV) was the
rate-determining step. As shown in Table 2, the computed rate constants were consistent
with the energy barriers, wherein the formation of FA showed a lower
rate constant than that of C–H and CO dissociations (1.59 ×
105 vs 2.71 × 108 and 1.86 × 106, respectively). In addition, the rate constants of higher
temperatures were also computed. As shown in Table 2, the results are in good agreement with
those at 473 K, further confirming the predominance of the main product
of furan for the studied reaction pathway.

Starting from the
most stable co-adsorption of furan and the H
atom, the CH3CH2CH3 formation was
computed. The first surface intermediate was C4H4O, originating from the ring opening of furan; the second step was
C4H4O dissociation into C3H3 + CHO; the subsequent reactions constituted the stepwise hydrogenation
of C3H3 leading to CH3CH2CH3, in which the last step of the H addition to CH3CH2CH2 had the highest barrier of 1.00
eV and was therefore the rate-determining step.

The parallel
and competitive reaction to CH3CH2CH3 formation was the stepwise hydrogenation of C4H4O leading first to R-CHO, then to R-CH2OH, and finally
to R′-CH=CH2. For R-CHO
formation, the first step was the hydrogenation of the C5 atom into
C3H3O-C5H2, which had a barrier of
0.79 eV, slightly higher than that of C4H4O
dissociation (0.67 eV) into C3H3 + CHO, but
both should be competitive under hydrogenation-rich conditions. The
subsequent step was the hydrogenation of the C atom distant from the
−CHO group stepwise (Figure 6), and the hydrogenation of C3H3O-C5H2 resulting in C3H3O-C5H3 with the highest barrier of 0.83 eV, which could be considered
the rate-determining step. For R-CH2OH formation from R-CHO
(Figure 7), R-CH2O hydrogenation into R-CH2OH had a higher barrier
than R-CH2O formation from R-CHO (1.13 vs 0.59 eV), and
R-CH2O hydrogenation was the rate-determining step. For
R′-CH=CH2 from R-CH2OH dissociation,
R-CH2OH dissociation into R-CH2 + OH had the
highest barrier of 1.57 eV and was the rate-determining step.

On the basis of the above discussion, it could be concluded that
furan was the main product of furfural conversion on the NiCuCu(111)
surface as furan formation was highly exothermic by 1.16 eV, indicating
a thermodynamically favorable process (Figure 3). This was in agreement with the experimental
study,24 in which Lukes et al. found that
furan was the main product with a yield of 46% upon using a 1:1 Ni–Cu
catalyst above 200 °C. In addition, they did not observe the
reduction of furan to tetrahydrofuran, which was consistent with my
theoretical results, i.e., the ring opening of furan was much more
favorable than the hydrogenation of furan (Figure 4). Based on the complete PES, the main product,
furan, can also be converted into propane as well as butanal, butanol,
and butene. This result also agrees with the experimental findings
regarding butanal formation.24

Furthermore,
it is interesting to compare the results obtained
in this study with those computed on the pure metallic Cu(111) surface.31 On the Cu(111) surface, F-CHO showed a tilted
η1(O) surface bonding mode in which furfural interacted
with the surface only via the O7 atom. On the bimetallic NiCuCu(111)
surface, not only the −HC=O group but also the furan
ring was in contact with the surface and the molecule was nearly parallel
to the surface. The adsorption energies of cis- and trans-F-CHO on the NiCuCu(111) surface (−1.78 and
−1.88 eV, respectively) were much higher than those on the
Cu(111) surface (−0.88 and −0.91 eV, respectively).
As expected, the adsorption configurations of F-CHO were different
on the two surfaces as the d-band of Cu was filled whereas that of
Ni was unfilled, and this facilitated the electron transfer to the
substrate.

Due to different adsorption configurations, different
reaction
mechanisms were possible on the two surfaces. On Cu(111),31 the most favorable process for the first step
was the hydrogenation of the C atom of the C=O group, leading
to a F-CH2O intermediate. In the subsequent reaction, both
F-CH2O hydrogenation into F-CH2OH and F-CH2O dissociation into F-CH2 were kinetically competitive
and, in addition, the final product was F-CH3, resulting
from F-CH2OH dissociation and hydrogenation as well as
the hydrogenation of F-CH2. On NiCuCu(111), the F-CHO dehydrogenation
into F-CO + H was much more kinetically and thermodynamically favored
than F-CHO hydrogenation into F-CH2O, leading to the main
product, furan. On the basis of the principal reaction of furan formation,
formation of other products, such as propane, butanal, butanol, and
butene, was considered possible. From the entire PES, CO constituted
the remaining surface species, with a high adsorption energy of −2.30
eV. Therefore, it was inferred that CO may have accumulated on the
surface and blocked the available surface sites, resulting in catalyst
deactivation. This highlights the need to find ways to eliminate CO
during experimental investigations.

3 Conclusions
In this study, the full potential energy surface of furfural conversion
into furan and other ring-opening products on the NiCuCu(111) surface
was investigated using periodic density functional theory computations
including the latest correction of long-range dispersion interaction
(PBE-D3). The goal was to clarify the full reaction mechanism by explaining
the experimentally observed selectivity of furan as well as other
byproducts in selective furfural conversion. All results obtained
will contribute toward the fundamental understanding of the hydrodeoxygenation
reactions of oxygenates obtained from biomass materials. Comparison
of NiCuCu(111) and Cu(111) for furfural hydrodeoxygenation revealed
their intrinsic differences in selectivity mainly owing to the different
adsorption configurations of furfural.

On the basis of the detailed
comparisons, F-CHO dissociation into
F-CO + H (F-CHO + H = F-CO + 2H) could be considered as the most favorable
kinetic process for the first step of furfural conversion, the subsequent
step was the decarbonylation of F-CO into furanyl (F-CO + 2H = F +
CO + 2H), and the last step of furan formation from the hydrogenation
of furanyl (F + CO + 2H = FA + CO + H) was the rate-determining step.
This implies that furan is the principal product of furfural conversion.

Starting from the most stable adsorption of furan and one H atom,
the computed results showed that the ring opening was much more kinetically
and thermodynamically favored than the hydrogenation of furan, indicating
that there was no possibility of the reduction of furan to tetrahydrofuran.
It was determined that the ring opening of furan could form a series
of products, such as propane, butanal, butanol, and butene. Notably,
the significant surface CO accumulation could occur due to the strong
adsorption of CO and favorable decarbonylation of F-CO; therefore,
researchers should consider eliminating the dissociated CO, experimentally.

Finally, it should be noted that the computed results will not
always show good agreement with all experimental observations using
bimetallic Cu–Ni catalysts. This is because there are many
factors that affect the activity of the catalyst in experiments, such
as the composition, preparation method, morphology, and support of
the catalyst. Especially, the reaction kinetics and products also
depend on the changes of the reaction conditions, such as the realistic
experimental temperatures and hydrogen pressures. In addition, there
are different methods for constructing monolayer bimetallic surfaces;
in this study, only one of them was selected to investigate the furfural
conversion. In the future, it would be interesting to explore other
methods to construct Cu–Ni bimetallic surfaces to study furfural
hydrodeoxygenation.

4 Computational Methods and
Models
4.1 Methods
All calculations were performed
using the plane-wave-based periodic density functional theory (DFT)
method implemented in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP, version
5.3.5),35,36 wherein the ionic cores were described by
the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method.37,38 The exchange and correlation energies were computed using the Perdew,
Burke, and Ernzerhof functional together with the latest dispersion
correction for counting van de Waals interaction (PBE-D3).39−41 To ensure accurate energies with errors of less than 1 meV per atom,
a cutoff energy of 400 eV and the Gaussian electron smearing method
with σ = 0.10 eV were used. Geometry optimization was performed
until the forces acting on atoms were lower than 0.02 eV/Å, whereas
the energy threshold-defining self-consistency of the electron density
was set at 10–4 eV. All transition-state structures
were located using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB)
method.42 For each optimized stationary
point, vibrational analysis was carried out at the same level of theory
to determine its characteristic as the minimum or saddle point, and
it was ensured that each transition state had only one imaginary frequency
along the reaction coordinate. In my previous work,31 it was demonstrated that the zero-point energy correction
had a slight effect on the calculated kinetic and thermodynamic results;
therefore, it was not included in this study. For bulk optimization,
the lattice parameter of the face-centered cubic (fcc) Cu unit cell
was determined by minimizing the total energy using a conjugated gradient
algorithm to relax the ions, and a 15 × 15 × 15 Monkhorst–Pack
k-point grid43 was used for sampling the
Brillouin zone. The computed lattice parameter of 3.561 Å was
in good agreement with the experimental value (3.614 Å)44 and results of other DFT calculations.45,46

4.2 Models
Chen et al.47 found that depending on the deposition temperature and
reaction environment, the bimetallic surface can be in one of the
three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the
surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the
subsurface monolayer, and alloying with the surface to produce intermixed
bimetallic surfaces. In a previous work by Myint,48 the Fe/Ni(111) and Cu/Ni(111) surfaces were modified by
replacing all Ni atoms in the top layer with Fe or Cu atoms. In addition,
Xiong et al.30 modeled the Ni/Cu(111) surface
by replacing all Cu atoms in the first layer of Cu(111) with Ni atoms.
In my previous study,31 a three-layer model
of the most stable Cu(111) surface was chosen to investigate the selective
hydrodeoxygenation of furfural, where the first layer was allowed
to relax, whereas the bottom two layers were fixed as bulk positions
by maintaining their optimized lattice constants. In this study, the
NiCuCu(111) surface was constructed by replacing all Cu atoms of the
first layer with Ni atoms, in agreement with the previous reports.30,47,48

The surface structural
relaxation and total energy calculations were performed with 3 ×
3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling.
For relevant gas phase species, a cubic box with a side of 15 Å
was used to determine the structures and total energies.

The
adsorption energy (Eads) was calculated
according to the equation Eads = EX/slab – Eslab – EX,31,34 where EX/slab is the total energy of
the slab with the adsorbate in its equilibrium structure, Eslab is the total energy of the slab, and EX is the total energy of the free adsorbate
in the gas phase. According to this relationship, the more negative
the Eads, the stronger the adsorption.
The energy barrier (Ea) and reaction energy
(Er) were calculated according to the
equations Ea = ETS – EIS and Er = EFS – EIS, where EIS, ETS, and EFS are the total
energies of the initial state (IS), transition state (TS), and the
final state (FS), respectively.
