Plasmonic
nanostructures, which allow light focusing at the deep
subwavelength scale, and colloidal nanoparticles with unique optoelectronic
properties are nowadays fabricated with nanometer precision. However,
to fully control and exploit nanoscale light–matter interactions
in hybrid plasmonic–nanophotonic devices, both materials must
be assembled in heterostructures with similar precision. Near-field
optical forces have recently attracted much attention, as they can
precisely trap and position nanoparticles at plasmonic hotspots. However,
long-range attraction and the surface bonding of nanoparticles usually
require other specific techniques, such as electrothermal heating
and surface chemical treatments. This Letter reports on the optical
trapping and deposition of dye–molecule nanoparticles in the
nanogap of a gold antenna. The nanoparticles are captured by focusing
a near-infrared laser beam on a targeted plasmonic antenna. This single-step
deposition process requires only a few seconds under 1.4–1.8
MW·cm–2 continuous-wave illumination and shows
a polarization dependence smaller than expected. Fluorescence and
electronic microscopy observations suggest that nanoparticle deposition
arises from a trade-off between optical and thermal effects.

Introduction
The possibility of
assembling metallic and dielectric materials
into nanoscale heterostructures has recently attracted much attention.1 Specific materials integrated into metallic nanostructures
such as plasmonic antennas and waveguides can enhance nanoscale light–matter
interactions such as directional light coupling and emission,2−4 surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)5 and infrared absorption (SEIRA),6 enhanced
and tunable single- and two-photon absorption/emission,7−12 second- or third-harmonic generation (SHG, THG),13,14 and strong plasmon–exciton coupling.15−17 These near-field
phenomena have given birth to numerous new fabrication and characterization
techniques and to a new class of hybrid plasmonic–nanophotonic
components.1 Among the candidate integration
materials, organic molecules are particularly anticipated in miniaturized
devices with improved or new functionalities for molecular nanoelectronics
and nanophotonics applications.1,18−20

However, fabricating metal–dielectric nanostructures,
especially
those involving plasmonic nanogap features, remains a challenging
task. Whereas downscaled top-down processes inherited from microelectronics
face critical resolution limits, bottom-up approaches promise to simplify
and reduce the cost of nanofabrication techniques, while preserving
their high accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility. A promising
avenue is the direct assembly of liquid-suspended nanomaterials on
targeted points on a chip’s surface.11,13,16,21−26 Colloidal synthesis science has been actively and fruitfully researched
in recent years, enabling the fabrication of miscellaneous kinds of
nanoparticles, from metallic and carbon nanostructures to quantum
dots and molecular aggregates. In this technique, the compositions,
sizes, and shapes of the particles can be tightly controlled.

Several deposition techniques have recently flourished. Among these,
deposition methods based on optical forces can precisely attach a
large variety of nanomaterials to target surfaces.27−35 Especially, near-field optical gradient forces arising from localized
surface plasmons can be conveniently used to attract nanoparticles
toward plasmonic hotspots36−39 and precisely fix the particles at the trap location.23,26 Nevertheless, the deposition requires accurate nanoscale management
of optical, electrostatic, chemical, and thermal interactions. For
instance, particle adhesion and long-range attraction have been promoted
in previous works by chemical-surface functionalization and electrically
induced heating, respectively.20,23

In this Letter,
we introduce a fast single-step technique for the
bottom-up fabrication of hybrid plasmonic–nanophotonic devices.
More specifically, we show that organic dye–molecule nanoparticles
suspended in a liquid colloidal solution can be precisely deposited
in the nanogap of a plasmonic bowtie antenna under intense laser irradiation.

Results
The deposition technique is demonstrated on nanoparticles of orange
organic dye molecules (1,4-bis(4-diphenylaminophenyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) fabricated by the reprecipitation method.40,41 The 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) fluorophore exhibits strong fluorescence
properties in both solution and solid (nanoparticle) states, a large
Stokes shift, and high photostability.42 It also forms stable spherical nanoparticles in aqueous solution.43 In the present study, the BTD molecules were
dissolved in acetone (1 × 10–5 mol L–1), and 0.3 mL of this solution was quickly dropped into 9 mL of ultrapure
water (Millipore Direct Q UV3 Water Purification System) with vigorous
stirring, as shown in Figure 1a. After 10 min of continuous stirring, the residual organic
solvent (acetone) was removed from the obtained solution by heating
in a microwave oven (2.45 GHz, 500 W, 2 min).

(a) Schematic of the fabrication process. A 0.3 mL solution made of
dye molecules diluted in acetone was quickly dropped into 9 mL of
stirred ultrapure water. The residual organic solvent was completely
removed after 2 min of microwave heating. (b) SEM micrograph of fabricated
nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were deposited on a glass substrate
by evaporating a drop of the colloidal solution used in the following
experiments.

Figure 1b shows
a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the nanoparticles contained
in a drop of the solution that was deposited and dried on a glass
coverslip. To prevent charging effects, a few-nanometer-thick layer
of tungsten was deposited on the sample. Most of the observed single
nanoparticles are 30–40 nm wide (average diameter = 34 nm).
The minimum and maximum values of measured particle diameters were
22 and 57 nm, respectively (see Supporting Information). However, the number of small particles may have been underestimated
because of the limited SEM resolution and the high density of the
nanoparticles on the SEM images.

The plasmonic nanogap antennas
in this work were gold triangular
dimers, called bowtie nanoantennas. These nanoantennas
were fabricated on a glass substrate (Matsunami #5) by electron beam
(e-beam) lithography. After e-beam exposure and development of the
resist film, a 30 nm thick gold layer was deposited on a 3 nm thick
chromium adhesion layer. After lift-off, bowtie antennas with nanogaps
of only a few nanometers were successfully fabricated. Each gold nanotriangle
had a 250 ± 5 nm long edge orthogonal to the antenna axis and
a 230 ± 5 nm length along the antenna axis.

A thin microfluidic
chamber was built on a thin glass coverslip
(Matsunami #1) as follows. The colloidal nanoparticle solution was
sonicated, and a 5 μL drop of the sonicated solution was deposited
on the thin coverslip. The coverslip was then covered with the plasmonic
chip in an inverted configuration (with the plasmonic structures located
on the bottom side). Finally, the fluidic chamber was sealed with
tape to prevent water evaporation. Based on the dimensions of the
plasmonic chip (24 × 24 mm2), the estimated depth
of the water chamber was 8 μm.

The sample was then placed
on an inverted microscope stage (see Figure 2) and targeted with
near-infrared (NIR) light from a Nd:YAG laser source (Millennia IR,
Spectra-Physics) emitting at 1064 nm. The light was focused through
a high-numerical aperture lens (Olympus UPlanSApo 100 × /1.40
oil). The fluorescence of the nanoparticles was excited by a green
laser emitting at 532 nm at low power (laser intensity below 0.1 kW
cm–2). To prevent rapid photobleaching of the dye
molecules, the fluorescence excitation was modulated by an electronic
signal generator. Experimental observations were recorded by an intensified
charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera (Hamamatsu, type C7772-01).

Figure 2 Schematic of
the experimental setup of nanoparticle deposition.
The intensity and polarization of the NIR laser beam are controlled
using a variable neutral density filter and a half-wave plate followed
by a quarter-wave plate. Fluorescence is excited by a green laser
whose intensity is modulated by a signal generator. The incident laser
beams are directed toward the sample by two dichroic mirrors. The
fluorescence emission is passed through a band-pass filter and collected
by an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera.

As schematically depicted in Figure 3a, the nanoparticles were deposited by bringing
the
gold nanoantenna through the focal point of the NIR laser, then returning
it to its initial position. This process was completed within a brief
time (less than 5 s). When the nanoantenna reached the focal point
of the laser beam, the laser intensity jumped from an estimated 55–74
kW cm–2 to 1.4–1.8 MW cm–2. During this brief increase in laser irradiation intensity, a few
of the nanoparticles were attracted and deposited in the nanogap of
the targeted antenna. Particle adhesion on the sample surface required
a strong laser intensity; at lower intensities, the optical trapping
of nanoparticles was brief and reversible.

laser beam’s path. (b) Image sequence taken from a recorded
nanoparticle-deposition experiment. Red dashed circular outlines denote
the positions of the laser beam spot. Fluorescence emitted by already
deposited nanoparticles is visible at the right side of each panel.
After focusing the NIR laser beam on the gold antenna, fluorescence
from the deposited nanoparticles is also seen at the laser beam position.
Adsorption of the nanoparticles to the sample’s surface is
evidenced by moving the gold antenna away from the laser beam path.
Scale bar: 2 μm.

Figure 3b
shows
an image sequence from Movie S1, illustrating
the nanoparticle-deposition process described above. Initially, the
imaging plane coincided with the sample surface, and the defocused
NIR laser beam was aligned with the bare gold nanoantenna. Only the
fluorescent light emitted by previously deposited nanoparticles at
the right side of the picture can be observed. Eventually, the sample
surface moves through the focal point of the NIR laser beam. The fluorescent
signal from the previously deposited nanoparticles decreased as the
imaging plane shifted downward, and a weak fluorescent signal appeared
at the laser spot position. Within 5 s, the focusing condition was
restored to its initial stage. Nanoparticle deposition is evidenced
by an additional white spot at the nanoantenna position. In the last
part of the experiment, the microscope stage was shifted to the right,
and the nanoparticles on the sample’s surface were confirmed
in the absence of laser–light interaction.

Nanoparticle
deposition was confirmed a posteriori by SEM observations
of the sample. Figure 4 shows a set of micrographs evidencing the location of deposited
nanoparticles. An additional picture shows a pre-experiment gold antenna
with no deposited particles. Experiments were performed using an elliptically
polarized laser beam at three intensity settings. Because the incident
beam was partially depolarized after reflection by the band-pass dichroic
mirror, the polarization ratio in the nanoparticle-deposition experiments
were set to 10:1. The polarization was set either parallel or orthogonal
to the antenna’s main axis. Under the parallel polarization
condition, a few nanoparticles were trapped and deposited in the nanogaps
of the bowtie antennas at 1.4 and 1.6 MW cm–2 laser
intensities, as can be observed in panels a and b of Figure 4, respectively. However, at
higher laser intensity (1.8 MW cm–2), the nanoparticles
attracted toward the antenna were stopped before reaching the nanogap.
Some nanoparticles (shown in red in Figure 4c) were deposited and melted a few tens of
nanometers away from the nanogap on both sides of the plasmonic antenna.
On the other hand, under the transverse polarization condition, no
particle was deposited at 1.4 and 1.6 MW cm–2 (Figure 4e), but interestingly,
single nanoparticle deposition was achieved at 1.8 MW cm–2 (Figure 4f). This
result proves that the optical gradient force was sufficiently strong
to attract nanoparticles toward the antenna’s nanogap using
high laser intensity irradiation. In other words, sufficient electromagnetic
energy was coupled to the plasmonic gap mode, probably because the
incident beam was elliptically polarized. No particle was found to
be deposited at the outer corners of the gold nanostructure.

(a–c) Nanoparticles deposited under parallel polarization at
different irradiation intensities. The nanoparticles are successfully
deposited in the nanogaps of the gold antennas at 1.4 MW cm–2 and 1.6 MW cm–2 but are melted at each side of
the nanoantennas at 1.8 MW cm–2. (d) A bare gold
nanoantenna, shown as a reference. Scale bar: 100 nm. (e) Nanoantenna
without deposited nanoparticle after irradiation under transverse
polarization conditions at 1.6 MW cm–2. (f) Single
nanoparticle deposited in the nanogap of a gold antenna under transverse
polarization conditions at 1.8 MW cm–2.

It can be seen in the panels a, b, and f of Figure 4 that the nanoparticles
were partially melted
when adhering to the nanogap surface. Despite the shape modification
caused by the partial melting, the particles can be individually distinguished
even when forming a compact assembly in the nanogap vicinity. The
sizes of the deposited nanoparticles well agree with the nanoparticles’
size measured prior to the experiment (see Supporting Information). Although the nanoparticles are larger than the
nanogap’s size, it can be seen that the nanogap was filled
by some melted parts of the deposited nanoparticles during the deposition
process. Thus, the partial melting of the deposited nanoparticles
allows for the deposition of dye molecules in the nanogap of the plasmonic
antenna.

Discussion
Although it was already reported in the
literature that plasmonic
nanoantennas can be used to trap nanoparticles,36−39 nanoparticle deposition relying
on near-field optical gradient forces arising from surface plasmons
remains a widely unexplored field. When a nanoparticle is trapped
by a plasmonic nanoantenna, the particle can be adsorbed at the surface
of the antenna if the optical gradient force acting on the particle
is strong enough to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the
particle’s and sample’s surfaces. When the distance
between both surfaces shrinks to a few nanometers, the two surfaces
attract each other and permanently bond under attractive van der Waals
interactions. In this work, the partial melting of the deposited nanoparticles
leads to an extended contact area between the particle and the sample,
which may play an important role in the adhesion of the nanoparticles.

The partial or complete melting of the deposited nanoparticles
observed on the SEM images indicates that the temperature significantly
rises near the surface of the gold nanoantenna during the deposition
process. The heat generated by the NIR light absorbed by the gold
nanostructure plays a significant role in the nanoparticle trapping
mechanism, causing additional effects such as heat convection, thermophoresis,
and thermo-osmosis. As discussed hereinafter, these phenomena may
either help or hinder the optical trapping of the nanoparticles.

As previously mentioned, under the parallel polarization conditions
the nanoparticles attracted toward the nanoantenna were stopped and
deposited before reaching the plasmonic nanogap when the laser intensity
was increased to 1.8 MW cm–2 (Figure 4c). Tsuboi et al., who observed a similar
phenomenon at the microscale,22 suggested
that such deposition patterns result from negative thermophoretic
forces acting on the nanoparticles. At high laser intensities, repulsive
thermophoretic forces may counterbalance the attractive optical gradient
force as the temperature of the gold antenna reaches a given threshold.
Consequently, the nanoparticles cannot reach the nanogap of the antenna
and are instead deposited at the position of equilibrium between both
thermophoretic and optical gradient forces.

The heat diffusion
in the liquid environment of the gold antenna
may also generate hydrodynamic flows, via convection or thermo-osmosis.
Although previous work from Ndukaife et al. reported that a controlled
convective flow can advantageously be used for the long-range attraction
of particles,26 convective flows are usually
considered as undesirable phenomena, making optical trapping unstable
or even impossible. In our experiment, the 8 μm high microfluidic
chamber was designed for preventing convective flows from reaching
more than a few tens of nm s–1.44 Yet, the nanoparticles were trapped and deposited within
seconds, in contrast to low-power plasmonic trapping of larger particles
(which rather occurs on minute time scales). Given the low nanoparticle
concentration (only a few nanoparticles were visible at any one time
in the (41 × 28) μm2 field of view) and the
limited range of action of the near-field optical gradient force,
thermal effects are expected to play a fundamental role in the fast,
long-range attraction process, drawing the nanoparticles toward the
plasmonic antenna over distances of several micrometers.

Heat
convection being ruled out, the long-range attraction of the
nanoparticles was attributed to thermo-osmosis, a phenomenon already
reported by different groups.45,46 Thermo-osmotic flows
result from the gradient of surface tension induced by a temperature
gradient at the interface between two phases (the liquid water and
the glass substrate in the present case). Due to the nanosize and
the high temperature of the gold antenna, a thermo-osmotic flow may
be generated during the deposition process, drawing surrounding particles
toward the center of the gold nanoantenna. Considering the time scale
of the nanoparticle trapping and deposition mechanism, the thermo-osmotic
flow velocity is expected to reach at least a few tens of micrometers
per second in our experiment, which is in good agreement with already
observed thermo-osmotic flows.45,46 Such a fast flow converging
toward the nanogap of the antenna may also explain the absence of
particle deposited near the outer corners of the gold nanostructure.
Indeed, the temperature gradient is expected to be stronger around
the outer tips of the gold triangles, while the temperature gradient
near the nanogap should tend to zero as the gap size decreases. Thus,
the flow velocity near the outer corners of the antenna is expected
to be faster than the flow velocity in the vicinity of the nanogap.
Moreover, due to its central position below the circulating fluid
loop, the nanogap should be subject to slower fluid flow.46 This would make the trapping of nanoparticles
more unstable in the outer part of the antenna, while still allowing
nanoparticles to be trapped and deposited in the nanogap of the antenna.

In addition, it is worth noticing that as recently highlighted
by Baffou et al.47 the amount of heat induced
by the light absorbed by the gold nanostructure is not directly proportional
to the electromagnetic field enhancement in the nanogap of the antenna.
This fact implies that the heat-induced long-range attraction and
the optical gradient force-induced short-range attraction of the particles
are not directly correlated. The NIR laser light being absorbed under
both polarization conditions, the light polarization should have a
weaker influence on the long-range attraction of the nanoparticles
than on the short-range attraction. In the case of the long-range
attraction being the critical factor for the particle deposition to
occur, it seems consistent to observe the deposition of nanoparticles
at relatively close laser intensities under both polarization conditions.

Eventually, we would like to underline the fact that despite the
small amount of deposited fluorescent material a bright fluorescence
signal was still experimentally observed after the nanoparticles had
settled in the nanogaps of the plasmonic antennas. The dye molecules
used in this work are robust against fluorescent quenching effects,
enabling the detection of nanoparticle-deposition events to the single-particle
level. As the described technique requires no chemical surface functionalization
prior to the nanoparticle deposition, we believe that it is straightforwardly
adaptable to the deposition of other organic nanomaterials. Nonorganic
nanoparticles may be deposited in a similar way, depending on their
surface properties.23 However, trapping
and depositing smaller nanoparticles would require a substantial increase
of the laser intensity, which may result in detrimental heating effects.

Conclusions
In summary, we have experimentally demonstrated a one-step optical
process for the trapping and the deposition of dye–molecule
nanoparticles in the nanogaps of plasmonic nanoantennas. This process
operates by briefly increasing the irradiation intensity of a laser
focused on a gold bowtie nanoantenna. Nanoparticles with approximate
diameters of 30–40 nm were successfully attracted and deposited
at the centers of the gold antennas. Consequently, plasmonic gaps
less than 20 nm wide were filled with nanoscale amounts of organic
material in a single optical operation. While precise positioning
and adhesion of the nanoparticles relied on the action of the near-field
optical gradient force, the fast, long-range attraction of the nanoparticles
was attributed to light-absorption-induced thermo-osmotic flows in
the thin microfluidic chamber. This technique allows the precise deposition
of colloidal nanoparticles in targeted plasmonic nanogaps, bringing
new perspectives to the fabrication of on-chip hybrid plasmonic–nanophotonic
devices. For instance, the hybrid nanoparticle–antenna structures
fabricated in this work could be used as efficient nanoscale organic
light sources in integrated plasmonic circuits. With additional specific
functionalization of the nanoparticles, this technique may also find
applications for the fabrication of a highly ordered array of organic
nanoparticles for ultrahigh density optical memory devices, highly
sensitive sensors, and so on.
