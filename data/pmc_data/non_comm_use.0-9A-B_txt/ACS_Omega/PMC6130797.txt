On the basis of the long-known prototypic
pharmacophore 3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)propylguanidine
(SK&F 91486, 2), monomeric, homodimeric, and heterodimeric
bisalkylguanidine-type
histamine H2 receptor (H2R) agonists with various
alkyl spacers were synthesized. Aiming at increased H2R
selectivity of the ligands, the imidazol-4-yl moiety was replaced
by imidazol-1-yl, 2-aminothiazol-5-yl or 2-amino-4-methylthiazol-5-yl
according to a bioisosteric approach. All compounds turned out to
be partial or full agonists at the h/gp/rH2R. The most potent analogue, the
thiazole-type heterodimeric ligand 63 (UR-Po461), was
a partial agonist (Emax = 88%) and 250
times more potent than histamine (pEC50: 8.56 vs 6.16, gpH2R, atrium). The homodimeric structures 56 (UR-Po395) and 58 (UR-Po448) exhibited the
highest hH2R affinities (pKi: 7.47, 7.33) in binding studies. Dimeric amino(methyl)thiazole
derivatives, such as 58, generated an increased hH2R selectivity compared to the monomeric analogues,
e.g., 139 (UR-Po444). Although monomeric ligands showed
up lower affinities and potencies at the H2R, compounds
with a short alkylic side chain like 129 (UR-Po194) proved
to be highly affine hH4R ligands.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
humans, the histamine receptor family comprises four subtypes,
namely, H1, H2, H3, and H4 receptors.1−4 They are activated by the biogenic amine histamine (1, Figure 1)5 and belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs).6 For more than three
decades, 3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)propylguanidine (SK&F
91486, 2, Figure 1)7 has been used as prototypic
pharmacophore for the synthesis of highly potent histamine H2-receptor (H2R) agonists of the guanidine class, e.g.,
compounds such as arpromidine (3, Figure 1).8 The application
of the bivalent ligand approach to acylguanidine-type H2R agonists by Birnkammer et al. led to highly potent and selective
H2R agonists, e.g., UR-AK 381 (4, Figure 1), raising questions
about the binding mode and usability of such dimeric ligands as pharmacological
tools.9 Insufficient chemical stability
of these acylguanidines, due to hydrolytic cleavage, led to carbamoylguanidine-type
H2R agonists, which proved to be stable.10 As many class A GPCRs were reported to form homo- and heterodimers,
bivalent ligands can potentially be used as pharmacological tools
to investigate the binding mode.11,12 Using different
spacer lengths, Birnkammer et al. showed that an interaction of the
second pharmacophore with an allosteric binding site at the same receptor
protomer is more likely than binding to the second orthosteric binding
site of an H2R homodimer.9

Figure 1 Structures
of histamine and selected H2R agonists (2–5).

For a better understanding
of the structure–activity relationship
of bisalkylguanidine-type dimeric H2R ligands, we prepared
and pharmacologically characterized several monomeric and dimeric
compounds derived from the recently reported homodimeric H2R agonist SK&F 93082 (5, Figure 1).13 In particular,
the influence of different heteroaromatic ring systems and different
spacer lengths on histamine receptor subtype selectivity was studied,
using radioligand binding assays to investigate the affinities to
the respective receptors. Investigations on H2R species
selectivity were performed involving recombinant human, guinea pig,
and rat H2Rs ([35S]GTPγS binding assay),14 which gave information about the type, affinity/potency,
and efficacy of the receptor ligand. Organ pharmacological studies
(gpH1R (ileum), gpH2R (right atrium))15,16 afforded agonistic
(H2R) and antagonistic (H1R) activities under
more physiological conditions. Functional activities on the guinea
pig ileum and right atrium were measured via the contractility of
the tissue and the increase of the heart frequency, respectively.
The main focus of this project was the development of H2R agonists. This also includes the characterization of numerous compounds
at the other histamine receptors (H1,3,4R), which led to
the identification of selective H4R ligands.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemistry
The
structures of amines 6–9, which were
used for the synthesis
of compounds 5, 53–63, 127–141, and 145,
are depicted in Figure 2. For the preparation of the dimeric ligands, the diamines 11–16 were treated with benzoyl isothiocyanate
(10) to give the corresponding dibenzoylthioureas 17–22 (Scheme 1) via nucleophilic addition, followed by
alkaline hydrolysis yielding the bisthioureas 23–28 as described.17,8 After S-methylation
using methyl iodide, the bis(S-methylisothioureas) 29–34 were Boc-protected to give the guanidinylation
reagents 35–40 (Scheme 1) following reported procedures.8,18 The homodimeric ligands 5, 53–60 were obtained by treating amines 6, 7, 8, or 9 (each 2 equiv) with some
of the guanidinylation reagents 35–40 in the presence of HgCl2 (2 equiv) and triethylamine
(NEt3),19 followed by Boc deprotection
of the intermediates 41–49. The heterodimeric
ligands 61–63 were synthesized by
treatment of the guanidinylating reagent 38 with an equimolar
mixture of two different amines (6 and 7, 6 and 8, or 7 and 8), followed by deprotection of the intermediates 50–52 using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, Scheme 1). It should be mentioned
that the use of more than 2 equiv of HgCl2 led to a decrease
in yield, presumably due to conversion of one S-methylisothiourea
moiety to the respective carbodiimide as described in the literature.18,19

were used for the preparation of the dimeric and monomeric
compounds 5, 53–63, 127–141, and 145 (cf. scheme 1–3).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the Homodimeric (5, 53–60) and Heterodimeric
(61–63) Histamine Receptor (HR) Ligands
Reagents and conditions: (a)
diamine (1 equiv), 10 (2 equiv), dichloromethane (DCM),
overnight, 0 °C → room temperature (rt); (b) K2CO3 (4.1 equiv), MeOH/H2O (7/3, v/v), 3–5
h, rt; (c) CH3I (2.1 equiv), MeCN, 1 h, reflux; (d) NEt3 (2 equiv), di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O) (2 equiv), overnight, rt; (e) 6, 7, 8, or 9 (2 equiv), HgCl2 (2
equiv), NEt3 (6 equiv), DCM, overnight, rt; (f) equimolar

rt; (g) 20% TFA, DCM, overnight, reflux.

The
synthetic strategy for the dimeric compounds was also used
for the synthesis of the monomeric compounds 127–141 (Scheme 2). Although the alkylated thioureas 82–87 were commercially available, 76–81 had to be synthesized by nucleophilic addition of the corresponding
amine (64–69) with 10 to give 70–75, followed by alkaline
hydrolysis yielding the desired compounds (cf. Scheme 2). S-methylation (88–99), Boc-protection (100–111), and guanidinylation (112–126)
were accomplished as described for the dimeric ligands with adapted
amount of substance (Scheme 2). Finally, the precursors 112–126 were deprotected using TFA to give 127–141 (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of the Monomeric HR Ligands 127–141
Reagents and conditions: (a)
amine (1 equiv), 10 (1 equiv), MeCN, 2 h, 0 °C →
rt; (b) K2CO3 (2.1 equiv), MeOH/H2O (7/3, v/v), 3–5 h, rt; (c) CH3I (1.1 equiv),

The cyclic guanidine derivative N-[3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)propyl]-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidin-2-amine
(145) was prepared in a three-step synthesis starting
from tetrahydropyrimidine-2(1H)-thione (142) (Scheme 3). Di-Boc-protection
of 142 in the presence of sodium hydride resulted in 143 (Scheme 3), as described.20 After guanidinylation
with 6, intermediate 144 was treated with
TFA to receive 145 (Scheme 3).

2.2 Stability of Dimeric Alkylguanidines
The chemical stability
of the bisalkylguanidine-type dimeric HR ligands
was exemplarily investigated for compounds 57 and 58, which were incubated in a binding buffer (BB, pH 7.4)
at a concentration of 100 μM at room temperature for 12 months.
Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis
revealed that 57 and 58 exhibited, in contrast
to the previously reported acylguanidine-type HR ligands,10 excellent chemical stabilities (Figure 3).

Figure 3 RP-HPLC images of 57 (A) and 58 (B) after
incubation in BB (pH 7.4) at rt for 12 months. Both compounds showed
no decomposition.

2.3 Pharmacology
The synthesized dimeric
(5, 53–63) and monomeric
(127–141 and 145) ligands
were investigated in radioligand competition binding assays (hH1,2,3,4R), in the [35S]GTPγS
binding assay (hH2,3,4R, gp/rH2R), in the guinea pig ileum assay
(gpH1R), and in the guinea pig right atrium
assay (gpH2R). For the radioligand and
the GTPγS binding assay, membranes of Sf9 cells, expressing hH1R + RGS4, h/gp/rH2R + Gsαs, hH3R + Giα2 + Gβ1γ2, or hH4R Giα2 + Gβ1γ2, were used.

2.3.1 Receptor Subtype Selectivity
To
investigate the affinities of 5, 53–63, 127–141, and 145 at the four hHR subtypes, competition binding studies
were performed using the radioligands [3H]mepyramine (hH1R), [3H]tiotidine or [3H]UR-DE25721 (hH2R), [3H]Nα-methylhistamine
(hH3R), and [3H]histamine (hH4R). The imidazol-4-yl-type homodimeric ligands 56 and 57, containing a decamethylene and a dodecamethylene
spacer, respectively, exhibited the highest affinities at every HR
subtype with the following selectivity profile: pKi H1R < H2R ≈ H3R ≈ H4R (Table 1). The same selectivity profile was evident for the
homodimeric compounds 5 and 53–55. The 2-amino-4-methylthiazol-5-yl- and 2-aminothiazol-5-yl-type
homodimeric ligands 58 and 59, respectively,
as well as the 2-amino-4-methylthiazol-5-yl/2-aminothiazol-5-yl-type
heterodimeric compound 63 proved to be selective H2R ligands with at least 1.5 log units difference in
pKi (H2R) over pKi (H1,3,4R) (Table 1). This demonstrated that replacement of
the imidazol-4-yl by an 2-aminothiazol-5-yl moiety is bioisosteric
with respect to H2R binding, but not in case of H3 and H4 receptor binding, and was in accordance with previous
reports on 2-aminothiazol-5-yl-type H2R selective ligands.22 The binding data at
the hH1R showed values, which were dependent
from the spacer length, respectively the lipophilicity. The replacement
of imidazol-4-yl by a imidazol-1-yl ring (60) leads to
a collapse of the affinities at all histamine receptor subtypes. The
monomeric reference substances 127–141 and 145 displayed increasing affinities at the hH2R with respect to their chain length, but
lower affinities compared to the respective dimeric compounds. Overall,
the affinities at the hH3,4Rs were higher,
except of the aminothiazole-containing structures 139–140. Molecules with a small side chain like 129 are of special interest as highly affine hH4R ligands. Sigmoidal radioligand displacement curves
at all HR subtypes are shown for 58, which exhibited
the highest H2R selectivity (Figure 4).

2.3.2 Functional
Characterization at the hH2,3,4R ([35S]GTPγS Binding
Assay)
The compounds 5, 57–59, 61–63, 136, and 139 were chosen to be investigated in the [35S]GTPγS binding assay to determine their agonistic
or antagonistic activities at the hH2,3,4R (Table 2). All compounds
proved to be partial agonists at the hH2R and silent antagonists at the hH3R
and hH4R, except the monomeric ligands 136 and 139, which exhibited inverse agonistic
activity at the hH3R and the hH4R, respectively. The homodimeric ligand 58, containing a C12-spacer, showed the highest H2R potency with a pEC50 of 7.27 and a maximal response
of 52% relative to histamine. At the H3R, the antagonistic
activities of imidazole-containing ligands (5, 57, 61, 62, and 136) were considerably higher than those of compounds with an amino(methyl)thiazole
moiety (58, 59, 63, and 139) (e.g., pKB values of 57 and 59: 7.33 vs 4.05; Table 2). Antagonistic activities at the hH4R were throughout low (pKB < 4).

2.3.3 H2R Species Selectivity
To study the H2R
species selectivity of the bisalkylguanidine-type
dimeric ligands, the agonistic activities of compounds 5, 57, 58, and 63 were also
investigated at the gpH2R and rH2R in the GTPγS binding assay. The studied
compounds exhibited slightly higher agonistic potencies at the gpH2R and rH2R compared
to the hH2R, with pEC50 values
>7.2 and >6.8, respectively (Table 3). Compound 5 showed the highest gpH2R potency (pEC50 = 7.60) with
a high efficacy (Emax = 0.95), and 57 displayed the highest rH2R
potency (pEC50 = 7.61) with an efficacy of 0.80. In general,
the efficacies were considerably higher at the gpH2R and rH2R (Emax > 0.7) compared to the hH2R (Emax < 0.52), reaching full
agonism
in case of compound 63 (gpH2R, Emax = 1.02). In sum, these investigations
revealed that the highest potencies and efficacies were observed at
the gpH2R followed by the rH2R and the hH2R.

2.3.4 Organ
Bath Studies
In addition
to the pharmacological characterization by radioligand competition
binding (cf. Table 1) and by functional studies using the [35S]GTPγS
binding assay (cf. Tables 2 and 3), organ bath experiments at
the guinea pig ileum (gpH1R) and at the
spontaneously beating guinea pig right atrium (gpH2R) were carried out. All ligands (5, 53–63, 127–141, and 145) displayed antagonistic activities at the gpH1R (Table 4). The imidazol-4-yl-type homodimeric ligands 57 and the monomeric compound 137, containing
a dodecamethylene spacer and a decamethyl side chain, respectively,
showed the highest pA2 values (6.91 and
6.74, respectively, cf. Table 4). A variation of the heteroaromatic moieties did almost not
affect the pA2 value (gpH1R), as shown for compounds containing a C8-spacer (5 and 58–63). The experiments at the gpH2R provided
interesting information about the structure–activity relationship
from monomeric and dimeric HR ligands. Regarding the imidazole-containing
ligands (5, 53–57, and 127–138), longer alkyl spacers resulted
in higher agonistic potencies (e.g., pEC50 of 53 (C3-spacer) and 57 (C12-spacer):
7.31 vs 8.11, pEC50 of 127 (methyl) and 138 (dodecyl): 5.10 vs 6.63). By contrast, an inverse correlation
was observed for the dimeric compounds with respect to the efficacy:
compound 53, containing a C3-spacer, acted
nearly as a full agonist (Emax = 0.96),
and 57, containing a C12-chain, exhibited
a maximum response of 0.63 compared to histamine (Table 4). With the aim of getting compounds
of highest potency and efficacy, 58–63 were equipped with a C8-spacer with 5 (pEC50 = 7.98, Emax = 0.91) as a prototype.
The replacement of imidazol-4-yl (5 and 138) by imidazol-1-yl (60 and 141) led to
a drastic decrease in potency and efficacy (5 vs 60: pEC50: 7.98 vs 5.31, Emax: 0.91 vs 0.20; 138 vs 141: pEC50: 6.63 vs not active, Emax: 0.91
vs 0). The introduction of amino(methyl)thiazole moieties (58, 59, and 61–63) resulted
in potent gpH2R agonists (pEC50: 7.69–8.56, Emax: 0.78–1.02, Table 4). Overall, a switch
from monomeric to dimeric ligands revealed compounds, which are approximately
100 times more potent than their monomeric analogues. The concentration–response
curve (CRC) of 63 (atrium, gpH2R) is exemplarily shown in Figure 5A.

The maximum response of all H2R agonists at the right
atrium could be completely antagonized by the addition of the H2R antagonist cimetidine (pA2 =
6.1025,26) (30 μM) after cumulative organ stimulation
(63, cf. Figure 5A). Full CRCs in the presence of cimetidine (30 μM,
30 min preincubation) were obtained for compounds 5, 57, 62, 63 (Figure 5B), 127, 128, 132, 135, and 137. The presence
of cimetidine led to a rightward shift of the CRCs in a way that is
in accordance with the calculated values via Schild equation (Table S1, Supporting Information). These results
proved that the positive chronotropic effect of the investigated (partial)
agonists in the guinea pig right atrium assay was mediated via the
H2R.

2.4 Computational Studies
To determine
accurate binding modes of the most interesting bivalent compounds 5 and 58 at the hH2R, and of the monovalent ligand 129 at both the hH3R and hH4R, molecular
docking studies were performed, coupled with molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations and free-energy (molecular mechanics generalized born
surface area (MM-GBSA)) calculations. Overall, five promising binding
poses for 5 and 58 at the hH2R, two poses for 129 at the hH3R, and three poses for 129 at the hH4R were determined by docking studies. Visual
analysis of ligand–receptor complexes refined by molecular
dynamics simulations (30 ns) has shown that some poses primarily formed
contacts within the orthosteric binding site, whereas other poses
additionally interacted with residues of the allosteric site between
extracellular loop (ECL)2 and ECL3 (Figures S29–S31 and Table S3). The binding free energies (MM-GBSA) of the respective
refined lowest free-energy docking poses (pose 1) of 5 (hH2R), 58 (hH2R), 129 (hH3R), and 129 (hH4R) amounted
to −49.0, −61.5, −30.4, and −46.0 kcal/mol
(Figures 6, 7, and S28). Interestingly,
compared to the other poses, these lowest free-energy conformations
were among those with the strongest H-bond contacts between ligand
atoms and acidic amino acids of the orthosteric binding site (D983.32, D1865.42 for 5 and 58 at hH2R, D1143.32 for 129 at hH3R, and D943.32, E1825.46 for 129 at hH4R) (cf. Figure S32). The probability
for an interaction with these residues is supported by the fact that
they were proven to act as key player in aminergic GPCR activation
and ligand binding,27−30 or to account for receptor selectivity (D1865.42 at hH2R).31 Interestingly,
both 5 and 58 showed high binding affinities
at hH2R (Ki < 100 nM), low affinities at the hH1R (Ki > 1 μM), but varying affinities
at the hH3R and hH4R (5: Ki < 100
nM; 58: Ki > 1 μM).
Although, by contrast, the monomeric imidazole-type analogue 129 bound unexpectedly poor to the hH2R, and, comparable to the dimeric compounds, also to the hH1R (Ki > 1 μM),
it bound to the hH3R and hH4R with high affinity (Ki < 100 nM). In this context, an amino(methyl)thiazole moiety present
in 58, unlike an imidazole moiety present in 5 or 129, was shown to trigger hH2R selectivity also in the case of other ligands.32,33 Aiming at an attempt to explain this behavior, different steric
effects of amino acids enclosing the orthosteric binding pocket may
come into play due to less voluminous residues at the hH2R (V993.33, V176ECL2.54-Q177ECL2.55) compared to hH1R (Y1083.33, F184ECL2.54-Y185ECL2.55), hH3R (Y1153.33, F192ECL2.54-F193ECL2.55), and hH4R (Y953.33, F168ECL2.54-F169ECL2.55). In addition,
an absence (hH1R) or different locations
(hH3R: E2065.46; hH4R: E1825.46) of fundamental acidic amino
acids in TM5 compared to hH2R (D1865.42) may further contribute to hH2R selectivity of amino(methyl)thiazole-type compounds, but to preferential
binding of imidazole-type ligands, such as 5 or 129, to the hH3R and hH4R. Although 5 is still capable of binding
to hH2R, most probably due to its larger
and more flexible chain, 129 merely binds to the hH3R and hH4R with
high affinity in a well-defined binding mode. Noteworthy, the lowest
free-energy pose (pose 1) of 129 bound to the hH4R showed H-bond contacts with E163ECL2 and T1785.42 in addition to contacts with D943.32 and E1825.46, compared to relatively few and weak H-bond
interactions when bound to hH3R (Figures 7 and S32). This may contribute to a lower 129 binding free energy when bound to the hH4R, compared to hH3R (Figure S28).

sticks, 5 is colored in green and 58 in

allosteric binding site is located most likely between ECL2 and ECL3.

the lowest binding free energy of the docking poses investigated by
30 ns MD simulations. Fundamental amino acids involved in ligand binding
are shown as light-blue sticks, 129 is colored in cyan
when bound to the hH3R (A) and in orange
when bound to the hH4R (B). H-bond contacts
are illustrated as dashed yellow lines. The allosteric binding site
is located most likely between ECL2 and ECL3 in both cases.

3 Summary
and Conclusions
Homo- (5 and 53–60) and heterodimeric (61–63) as well
as monomeric (127–141 and 145) hetarylpropylguanidine-type HR ligands were obtained in excellent
yield by a six-step synthesis. The replacement of the imidazolyl by
an aminothiazolyl moiety led, in accordance with previous reports
on acylguanidine- and carbamoylguanidine-type HR ligands,9,10,22 to highly selective and potent
H2R agonists. The variation of the spacer length revealed
best results for compounds containing a C8-, C10-, or C12-spacer (5, 56–59, and 61–63). The heterodimeric
compounds showed potencies in a one-digit nanomolar range (up to 250
times the potency of histamine) as full agonists in the gpH2R atrium assay. In comparison to the monomeric ligands,
the dualsteric structures showed up notably higher hH2R selectivity, higher affinities in the hH2R binding assay, and higher potencies at the functional
H2R assays (e.g., guinea pig right atrium). The dimeric
ligands displayed a slightly higher sensitivity for gpH2R and rH2R compared to the hH2R (maximum deviation less than 1 log
unit). Monomeric imidazole-type compounds with small side chains,
like 129, showing high hH4R affinity, could be of interest for the development of selective hH4R ligands to play an important role in different
inflammatory, allergic, and immunological processes.34,35 Molecular modeling studies, including the bivalent ligands 5 and 58, suggested an interaction of the guanidine
groups with the acidic residues D983.32 and D1865.42 as key contributions to H2R binding. As the bisalkylguanidines
turned out to be very stable chemical entities, the synthesized H2R selective aminothiazole derivatives represent promising
lead structures for the development of pharmacological tools for the
H2R, such as 58, 59, and 63. Moreover, the presented data could be of interest for
the development of CNS penetrating H2R agonists—in
consideration of changing the basicity of the strongly basic alkylguanidine
structure, using bioisosteric approaches, and the lipophilicity—and
H2R ligands useful for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Conditions
Commercially available
chemicals (9, 10, 11–16, 64–69, and 82–87) and solvents were purchased from Acros Organics
(Geel, Belgium), Alfa Aesar GmbH & Co. KG (Karlsruhe, Germany),
Iris Biotech GmbH (Marktredwitz, Germany), Merck KGaA (Darmstadt,
Germany), Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (München, Germany), or
TCI Europe (Zwijndrecht, Belgium) and were used as received. Deuterated
solvents for nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR and 13C NMR) spectra were purchased from Deutero GmbH (Kastellaun,
Germany). Compounds 6–8 were prepared
as previously described.22,32,36,37 The synthesis steps described
in Section 2.1 were
carried out according to reported procedures.8,17−19 All reactions involving dry solvents were accomplished
in dry flasks under nitrogen or argon atmosphere. Millipore water
was used for the preparation of buffers, HPLC eluents, and stock solutions.
Column chromatography was carried out using Merck silica gel Geduran
60 (0.063–0.200 mm) or Merck silica gel 60 (0.040–0.063
mm) (flash column chromatography). The reactions were monitored by
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on Merck silica gel 60 F254 aluminum sheets, and spots were visualized under UV light at 254
nm, by iodine vapor, ninhydrin, or fast blue B staining.

Nuclear
magnetic resonance (1H NMR and 13C NMR) spectra
were recorded on a Bruker (Karlsruhe, Germany) Avance 300 (1H: 300 MHz, 13C: 75 MHz) or Avance 400 (1H:
400 MHz, 13C: 101 MHz) spectrometer using perdeuterated
solvents. The chemical shift δ is given in parts per million
(ppm). Multiplicities were specified with the following abbreviations:
s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), quint (quintet),
m (multiplet), and br (broad signal) as well as combinations thereof. 13C NMR peaks were determined by distortionless enhancement
by polarization transfer (DEPT) 135 and DEPT 90: “+”
primary and tertiary carbon atom (positive DEPT 135 signal), “–”
secondary carbon atom (negative DEPT 135 signal), and “quat”
quaternary carbon atom. NMR spectra were processed with MestReNova
11.0 (Mestrelab Research, Compostela, Spain). High-resolution mass
spectrometry (HRMS) was performed on an Agilent 6540 UHD Accurate-Mass
quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
(MS) system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using an electrospray
ionization (ESI) source. Elemental analyses (EA) were performed on
a Heraeus Elementar Vario EL III and are within ±0.4% unless
otherwise noted. Melting points (mp) were measured on a Büchi
(Essen, Germany) B-545 apparatus using an open capillary and are uncorrected.
Preparative HPLC was performed with a system from Knauer (Berlin,
Germany) consisting of two K-1800 pumps and a K-2001 detector. A Eurospher-100
C18 (250 × 32 mm2, 5 μm) (Knauer, Berlin, Germany)
or a Kinetex XB-C18 (250 × 21.2 mm2, 5 μm) (Phenomenex,
Aschaffenburg, Germany) served as stationary phase. As mobile phase,
0.1% TFA in millipore water and acetonitrile (MeCN) were used. The
temperature was 25 °C, the flow rate was 15 mL/min, and UV detection
was performed at 220 nm. Analytical HPLC was performed on system from
Merck-Hitachi (Darmstadt/Düsseldorf, Germany) composed of an
L-6200-A pump, an AS 2000A autosampler, an L-4000A UV detector, and
a D-6000 interface. Stationary phase was a Eurosphere-110 C18 (250
× 4 mm2, 5 μm) (Knauer, Berlin, Germany) or
a Kinetex XB-C18 (250 × 4.6 mm2, 5 μm) (Phenomenex,
Aschaffenburg, Germany). As mobile phase, mixtures of MeCN and aqueous
TFA were used (linear gradient: MeCN/TFA (0.1%) (v/v) 0 min: 5:95,
25 min: 50:50, 26–35 min: 95:5 (method A); 0 min: 10:90, 25
min: 50:50, 26–35 min: 95:5 (method B); flow rate = 0.80 mL/min, t0 = 3.32 min). Capacity factors were calculated
according to k = (tR – t0)/t0. Detection
was performed at 220 nm. All compounds were analyzed using method
A, except for 139–141 (method B).
Furthermore, filtration of the stock solutions with poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
filters (25 mm, 0.2 μm, Phenomenex Ltd., Aschaffenburg, Germany)
was accomplished before testing. Compound purities determined by HPLC
were calculated as the peak area of the analyzed compound in % relative
to the total peak area (UV detection at 220 nm). The HPLC purities
(see Supporting Information) of the final
compounds were ≥95% except for compound 58 (94.3%).
The tested compounds were screened for pan-assay interference compounds
(PAINS) and aggregation by publicly available filters (http://zinc15.docking.org/patterns/home, http://advisor.docking.org).38,39 None of the screened structures have been
previously reported as PAINS or an aggregator. Since Devine et al.
described 2-aminothiazoles as a promiscuous frequent hitting scaffold
at different enzymes,40 full dose–response
curves for all experiments and compounds, not only for the 2-aminothiazoles,
were measured. None of the curves showed abnormalities, e.g., high
Hill slopes, which could be a hint for PAINS.39

4.2 Chemical Synthesis and Analytical Data

Dibenzoylthioureas 17–22
To an ice-cold solution of the pertinent diamine (11–16, 1 equiv) in dichloromethane (DCM), benzoyl
isothiocyanate (2 equiv) in DCM was added dropwise. The reaction was
allowed to stir at room temperature (rt) overnight, and the organic
solvent was concentrated under vacuum. The residue was suspended in
80 mL of methanol (MeOH) for 1 h and filtered to give the pure title

the Monomeric Ligands (127–141 and 145)
TFA (4.0 mL) was added to a solution of the
protected precursors 112–126 or 144 in DCM (16.0 mL, 20% TFA in DCM), and the mixture was
refluxed overnight until the protecting groups were removed (TLC control).
Subsequently, the solvent was evaporated in vacuo and the residue
was washed three times with Et2O (each 20 mL). The crude
product was purified by preparative RP-HPLC (MeCN/0.1% TFA (aq): 5/95–40/60).
All compounds were dried by lyophilization and obtained as di-trifluoroacetates.

4.2.14 Synthesis of Di-tert-butyl-2-thioxodihydropyrimidin-1,3(2H,4H)-dicarboxylat (143)45
To a stirred solution of 142 (871 mg, 7.50 mmol) in THF (150 mL) under argon at 0 °C, hexane
(20 mL) and sodium hydride (1.35 g, 33.8 mmol, 60% in mineral oil)
were added. After 5 min, the ice bath was removed, and the reaction
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min. The mixture was
cooled to 0 °C again, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate
(3.60 g, 16.5 mmol) was added, and the ice bath was removed after
30 min of stirring at that temperature. The resulting slurry was stirred
for another 2 h at room temperature. Then, the reaction was quenched
with an aqueous solution of saturated NaHCO3 (10 mL). The
reaction mixture was poured into water (250 mL) and extracted with
EtOAc (3 × 70 mL). The combined organic layer was dried over
Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo

4.3 Pharmacological
Methods
4.3.1 Materials
Histamine dihydrochloride
was purchased from Alfa Aesar GmbH & Co. KG (Karlsruhe, Germany).
[3H]mepyramine (specific activity: 20.0 Ci/mmol), [3H]tiotidine (specific activity: 78.4 Ci/mmol), [3H]Nα-methylhistamine (specific
activity: 85.3 Ci/mmol), and [3H]histamine (specific activity:
25.0 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig,
Germany). GTPγS was purchased from Roche (Mannheim, Germany),
and [35S]GTPγS was purchased from PerkinElmer Life
Science (Boston) or Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany). [3H]UR-DE257 was synthesized in our laboratories. All stock
solutions were dissolved in millipore water or in a mixture of Millipore
water/DMSO. In all assays, the final DMSO content amounted to <0.5%.

4.3.2 Membrane Preparations46
Sf9 cells were seeded at 3.0 × 106 cells/mL
and infected with a 1:100 dilution of high-titer baculovirus
stocks encoding hH1R + RGS4, h/gp/r H2R + Gsαs, hH3R Giα2 + Gβ1γ2, or hH4R Giα2 + Gβ1γ2. The cells were cultured for 48 h before
the production of the membrane preparation according to a previously
reported protocol, using 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/mL benzamidine,
and 10 μg/mL leupeptin as protease inhibitors. Membranes were
suspended in binding buffer (12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA,
and 75 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) and stored at −80 °C until
use.

4.3.3 Radioligand Binding Assay14,47−49
Sf9 membranes were thawed and sedimented
by centrifugation at 13 000g at 4 °C
for 10 min. The membranes (hH1R + RGS4, hH2R + Gsαs, hH3R Giα2 + Gβ1γ2, hH4R Giα2 + Gβ1γ2) were resuspended in a cold (4 °C) binding buffer (BB: 12.5
mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, and 75 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) at a final
soluble protein concentration of 2–6 μg per 1 μL
BB. Experiments were performed in 96-well plates (polypropylene (PP)
microplates 96 well, Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) using
a total volume of 100 μL of BB, which contained 40–90
μg of membrane, 0.05% bovine serum albumin (BSA), the respective
radioligand ([3H]mepyramine 5 nM, [3H]tiotidine
10 nM, [3H] UR-DE257 20 nM, [3H]Nα-methylhistamine 3 nM, or [3H]histamine
15 nM), and the investigated ligands at various concentrations. During
the incubation period (60 min) at room temperature, the plates were
shaken at 250 rpm with a Heidolph Titramax 101 (Heidolph Instruments
GmbH & Co. KG, Schwabach, Germany). Afterward, bound radioligand
was separated from free radioligand by collection of the membranes
on polyethylenimine-pretreated GF/C filters (Whatman, Maidstone, U.K.)
using a 96-well Brandel harvester (Brandel Inc., Unterföhring,
Germany). After two washing steps with binding buffer, filter pieces
were punched and transferred into 1450-401 96-well sample plates (PerkinElmer,
Rodgau, Germany). Scintillation cocktail (200 μL, Rotiszint
Eco plus, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) was added, and the plates were
sealed with Plateseal 1450-461 (PerkinElmer, Rodgau, Germany) and
incubated in the dark for 12 h. Radioactivity (dpm) was measured with
a MicroBeta2 1450 scintillation counter (PerkinElmer).
Experimental data were analyzed by nonlinear regression and were best-fitted
to sigmoidal concentration–response curves using Prism 5.0c
software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).50

4.3.4 [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay14,49,51,52
Membranes of Sf9 cells expressing the h/gp/rH2R + Gsαs, hH3R Giα2 + Gβ1γ2, or hH4R Giα2 + Gβ1γ2 were thawed and sedimented by centrifugation
at 13 000g at 4 °C for 10 min. The membranes
were resuspended in a cold (4 °C) binding buffer BB (12.5 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, and 75 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) at a final
soluble protein concentration of 1 μg per 1 μL BB. All
H4R experiments contained additionally 100 mM NaCl. For
investigations in the antagonist mode, histamine was added to the
reaction mixture (hH2R: 1 μM, hH3,4R: 100 nM). Experiments were performed in
96-well plates (PP microplates 96 well, Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen,
Germany) in a total volume of 100 μL, containing 10 μg
of membrane, 1 μM GDP, 0.05% BSA, 20 nCi [35S]GTPγS,
and the investigated ligands at various concentrations. During the
incubation period (90 min) at room temperature, the plates were shaken
at 250 rpm with a Heidolph Titramax 101 (Heidolph Instruments GmbH
& Co. KG, Schwabach, Germany). Afterward, bound radioligand was
separated from free radioligand by filtration through GF/C filters
(Whatman, Maidstone, U.K.) using a 96-well Brandel harvester (Brandel
Inc., Unterföhring, Germany). After two washing steps with
binding buffer, the filter pieces were punched and transferred into
1450-401 96-well sample plates (PerkinElmer). Unspecific binding was
determined in the presence of 10 μM GTPγS. Each well was
supplemented with 200 μL of scintillation cocktail (Rotiszint
Eco plus, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), and the plates were sealed with
Plateseal 1450-461 (PerkinElmer, Rodgau, Germany) and incubated in
the dark for 12 h. Radioactivity (ccpm) was measured with a MicroBeta2 1450 scintillation counter (PerkinElmer). Data were analyzed
by nonlinear regression and were best-fitted to sigmoidal concentration–response
curves with the Prism 5.0c software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).

4.3.5 Histamine H1 Receptor Assay on
Isolated Guinea Pig Ileum15
Guinea
pigs of either sex (250–500 g) were stunned by a blow on the
neck and exsanguinated. The ileum was rapidly removed, rinsed, and
cut into segments of 1.5–2.0 cm length. The tissues were mounted
isotonically (preload of 5 mN) in a jacketed 20 mL organ bath that
was filled with Tyrode’s solution (composition [mM]: NaCl,
137; KCl, 2.7; CaCl2, 1.8; MgCl2, 1.0; NaH2PO4, 0.4; NaHCO3, 11.9; and glucose
5.0) supplemented with atropine, at a concentration not affecting
H1 receptors (0.05 μM), to block cholinergic muscarinic
receptors. The bath was aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2 and heated to 37 °C. During an equilibration period of 80 min,
the tissues were stimulated three times with histamine (2 × 1
μM, 1 × 10 μM) followed by washout. Up to four cumulative
CRCs were determined on each tissue: the first by addition of histamine
(0.01–30 μM) and the second to fourth by addition of
histamine in the presence of increasing concentrations of antagonist
(preincubation: 10–15 min). pEC50 differences were
not corrected because four successive curves for histamine were superimposable
under these conditions (N > 10). Data were analyzed
by nonlinear regression and were best-fitted to sigmoidal concentration–response
curves using Prism 5.0c software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).

4.3.6 Histamine H2 Receptor Assay on
the Isolated Guinea Pig Right Atrium (Spontaneously Beating)2,16,53
Hearts were rapidly
removed from guinea pigs used for studies on the ileum (see above).
The right atrium was quickly dissected and set up isometrically in
the Krebs–Henseleit solution under a diastolic resting force
of approximately 5 mN in a jacketed 20 mL organ bath at 32.5 °C.
The bath fluid (composition [mM]: NaCl, 118.1; KCl, 4.7; CaCl2, 1.8; MgSO4, 1.64; KH2PO4, 1.2; NaHCO3, 25.0; glucose, 5.0; sodium pyruvate, 2.0),
supplemented with (RS)-propranolol (0.3 μM)
to block β-adrenergic receptors, was equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Experiments were started after 30
min of continuous washing and an additional equilibration period of
15 min. Two successive histamine CRCs displayed a significant desensitization
of 0.13 ± 0.02 (N = 16 control organs). This
value was used to correct each individual experiment. For agonists,
two successive concentration–frequency curves were generated:
the first for histamine (0.1–30 μM) and the second for
the agonist of interest either in the absence or in the presence of
cimetidine (30 μM, 30 min preincubated). Additionally, the sensitivity
to 30, 100, or 300 μM cimetidine was checked at the end of each
H2R agonist CRC, and a significant reduction of frequency
was observed. The relative potency of the agonist under study was
calculated from the corrected pEC50 difference (ΔpEC50). pEC50 values are given relative to the long-term
mean value for histamine (pEC50 = 6.16) determined in our
laboratory (pEC50 = 6.16 + ΔpEC50). Data
were analyzed by nonlinear regression and were best-fitted to sigmoidal
concentration–response curves using Prism 5.0c software (GraphPad,
San Diego, CA).

4.4 Computational Methods
4.4.1 Model Preparation
To examine possible
binding modes of the bivalent ligands 5 and 58 at hH2R and of the monovalent ligand 129 at both hH3R and hH4R, homology models of these receptors were prepared
as follows: For hH4R, the described hH4R model was used,54 which was based on the inactive state crystal structure of the hH1R55 (PDB ID: 3RZE), and the models
comprising hH2R and hH3R were adapted from this model. Model preparation was
essentially performed as described in Wifling et al.54 using the modeling suite SYBYL-X 2.0 (Tripos Inc., St.
Louis, MO).

4.4.2 Molecular Docking
The most interesting
bivalent compounds 5 and 58 on the one hand
and the monomeric ligand 129 on the other hand were geometry-optimized
by means of Gaussian 0956 at the HF/6-31(d,p)
level, attributing the ligands a formal charge of +2 and +1, respectively.
Upon file conversion by means of Open Babel57 and assignment of physiological ionization states by means of ChemAxon
(http://www.chemaxon.com) Marvin 16.3.28.0, 2016 Calculator Plugins, flexible docking was
performed with the software package Autodock Vina.58 The following hH2R amino acids
were kept as flexible: K18, S75, Q79, Y94, T95, D98, V99, C102, R161,
N168, H169, T170, T171, S172, K173, K175, V176, V178, N179, E180,
G183, D186, G187, T190, W247, Y250, F251, F254, R257, R260, N266,
E267, E270, L274, W275, G277, Y278. For hH3R, the amino acids T34, M41, Y91, Y94, V95, W110, L111, D114, Y115,
C118, E185, H187, F192, F193, Y194, W196, L199, A202, S203, E206,
W371, Y374, T375, M378, R381, H387, D391, D394, E395, D398, W399,
L401, W402 were kept as flexible, and for hH4R the residues R15, M22, Y72, H75, T76, W90, L91, D94, Y95,
C98, M150, K158, E160, S162, E163, F168, F169, S170, W172, L175, T178,
S179, E182, W316, Y319, S320, T323, L326, S330, S331, T333, S337,
Y340, R341, F344, W345, Q347, W348. The search box was set to a size
of 28 Å × 32 Å × 32 Å, centered at the binding
pocket. Up to 20 binding poses were exported for each ligand. Taking
into account the results of the scoring function as well as experimental
data, the respective best poses were selected for downstream molecular
dynamics simulations.

4.4.3 Molecular Dynamics Simulations
To identify the respective most probable binding pose, 30 ns molecular
dynamics simulations were performed in a water box at 310 K, and subsequently,
free energy (MM-GBSA59) calculations were
performed using the Amber 1460 molecular
dynamics package. To determine ligand force-field parameters, RESP61 charges were determined by means of Gaussian
0956 at the HF/6-31(d,p) level, and general
amber force field62 atom types as well
as RESP61 charges were assigned using antechamber.60 parmchk260 and tleap60 were used for input file generation. For ligand
guanidine atoms and protein residues, the Amber ff99SB63 force-field parameters were used. The simulation
steps were carried out in an octahedral box comprising an 8.0 Å
TIP3P64 water layer and neutralizing chloride
ions.65 The mbondi2 parameter set was utilized.66,67 The respective systems were minimized using the steepest descent
(2500 steps) and conjugated gradient (7500 steps) methods without
restraints, and were subsequently heated from 0 to 100 K over 50 ps
in the NVT ensemble as well as from 100 to 310 K over 450 ps in the
NPT ensemble. During the first ns of the 5 ns equilibration period,
initial harmonic restraints of 5 kcal/mol Å2 were
applied to all ligand and receptor atoms, and, beginning from 1 ns,
harmonic restraints on receptor main chain atoms were reduced from
5.0 to 0.5 kcal/mol Å2 in a stepwise manner and maintained
during the 30 ns simulation. Bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained
using SHAKE68 to enable a frame step size
of 2 fs.65,69 Nonbonded interactions were cut off at 8.0
Å, and long-range electrostatics were computed using the particle-mesh
Ewald70 method. The Langevin thermostat71,72 with a collision frequency of 1.0 ps–1 and randomly
assigned initial velocities was used to maintain a target temperature
of 310 K. The Berendsen barostat73 with
isotropic position scaling and a pressure relaxation time of 1.0 ps
was employed to keep the pressure constant at 1 bar. Data were collected
every 10 ps. H-bond and cluster analysis were performed by means of
CPPTRAJ60 for the entire 30 ns trajectories.
Moreover, the average linkage algorithm74 was applied for cluster analysis, setting a cluster size of 5, and
the programming language R75−78 was used for the preparation of H-bond plots. Binding
free-energy (MM-GBSA) calculations of the 30 ns trajectories were
performed using MMPBSA.py59 and a frame
step size of 10 ps, and the corresponding plots were obtained using
the Prism 5.01 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). All other figures
were created with PyMOL Molecular Graphics system, version 1.8.2.1
(Schrödinger LLC, Portland, OR).
