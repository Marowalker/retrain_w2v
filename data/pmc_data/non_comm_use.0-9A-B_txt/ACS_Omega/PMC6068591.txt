A major challenge in synthetic biology,
particularly for mammalian
systems, is the inclusion of adequate external control for the synthetic
system activities. Control at the transcriptional level can be achieved
by adaptation of bacterial repressor–operator systems (e.g.,
TetR), but altering the activity of a protein by controlling transcription
is indirect and for longer half-life mRNAs, decreasing activity this
way can be inconveniently slow. Where possible, direct modulation
of protein activity by soluble ligands has many advantages, including
rapid action. Decades of drug discovery and pharmacological research
have uncovered detailed information on the interactions between large
numbers of small molecules and their primary protein targets (as well
as off-target secondary interactions), many of which have been well
studied in mammals, including humans. In principle, this accumulated
knowledge would be a powerful resource for synthetic biology. Here,
we present SynPharm, a tool that draws together information from the
pharmacological database GtoPdb and the structural database, PDB,
to help synthetic biologists identify ligand-binding domains of natural
proteins. Consequently, as sequence cassettes, these may be suitable
for building into engineered proteins to confer small-molecule modulation
on them. The tool has ancillary utilities which include assessing
contact changes among different ligands in the same protein, predicting
possible effects of genetic variants on binding residues, and insights
into ligand cross-reactivity among species.

Introduction
Synthetic biology is a technology for
engineering of new biological
functions through the construction of novel genetic networks to realize
novel metabolic, signaling, and developmental pathways.1−5 Some synthetic biological systems use only natural proteins (i.e.,
as represented by the Swiss-Prot canonical sequence for that species)
or achieve novel functions by combining proteins not normally found
in the same cell or even the same species. Other systems involve the
use of novel proteins, themselves typically including domains chosen
from various natural proteins and coded into an engineered gene: an
example is the SynNotch synthetic cell–cell signaling system.6 In many applications, there is a clear need for
synthetic biological devices to be subject to external controls, for
example, to create adequate safeguards and to exert temporal and/or
spatial control on a particular system. This need is particularly
acute when the device is intended to be used in the general environment
or in a medical implant. At the very least, there needs to be a reliable
means to shut the system down quickly, and much thought is being given
to this problem.7,8

Most control systems used
to date have operated by using small
molecules to control gene transcription. Typically, they use antibiotic-sensitive
transcriptional repressor proteins from bacterial systems, the operator
sites of which are fused to the promoter of the synthetic gene: the
well-known tetR system is a much-used example.9 These systems work well but their effect on protein activity is
very indirect, blocking transcription of further mRNA for a protein
but not affecting existing molecules of the protein itself nor of
the mRNA from which new protein molecules will be translated. Constitutive
differences in mRNA half-lives can, however, limit this approach for
particular proteins.10 Direct control of
protein activity would be faster, which is why this dominates natural
inter- and intracellular signaling. For synthetic circuits, control
by rapidly diffusing small molecules would be particularly useful
and several novel controls of this type have been constructed, generally
by a laborious process of selection from large libraries of protein
variants.11,12

As modulators of activity, small molecules
have many advantages
over alternative forms of experimental functional modulation, such
as CRISPR, RNAi, and antibody blocking. Principal advantages of these
are as follows: (a) rapid action; (b) dose response can be used to
vary the effects quantitatively; (c) reversal by wash-out; (d) use
of equal and low-potency analogues with different chemotypes as specificity
and reproducibility controls; (e) although less common, activators
or agonists may be suitable for positive modulation (i.e., gain-of-function
interventions); (f) allosteric modulators offer a different type of
kinetic control; and (g) small molecules can be accurately measured
both pre and post experiment (e.g., to monitor input dosing and metabolic
degradation).

The need for pharmacological researchers to access
data for the
interactions between druglike molecules and their protein targets
has resulted in the production of a range of databases aligned to
this general task, starting with BindingDB in 2001.13 Updates on these resources have recently been reviewed.14 These databases present valuable sources of
information that might help synthetic biologists identify drug–protein
pairs in which the drug-binding site of the protein is small and self-contained
enough to be used as a “module” that will confer drug
control on engineered proteins. This would allow rapid and direct
modulation of the activity of the protein without the lag times involved
in transcription, translation, and degradation. The use of an approved
drug as the controlling ligand would bring the additional advantage
in that safety aspects of clinical drugs, and their possible off-target
side effects, are generally well established. This makes the approach
particularly valuable if the synthetic biological constructs are eventually
to be translated into in vivo, clinical, or animal-agricultural contexts.
However, attempting such module selection from large-scale chemogenomic
databases such as BindingDB,15 ChEMBL,16 and even directly from PDB17 would be challenging. Various types of PDB abstractions
such as the sc-PDB ligand-binding database18 and PDBbind19 are also useful resources
but have long update cycles.

To make navigating these complex
datasets easier, we have created
a web-based tool that integrates pharmacological and protein-binding
information as a first-stop entry point for the drug-binding domains
of selected proteins in a manner useful to synthetic biologists. The
interface we designed supports a variety of searching and browsing
strategies and facilitates the choosing of the most appropriate protein
domain to be used as a controllable module for a particular purpose.
This functionality, that we have named SynPharm, has been integrated
as a tool within the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY database (GtoPdb),
an expert-curated, open-access database by the International Union
of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology.20 This
was chosen for the following reasons:1. It is embedded in an environment with
an active experimental synthetic biology team. This means that the
initial bioinformatics in vitro testing cycles are already in progress
(and the latter will feed back to enhancements of the former).

2. GtoPdb has a relatively
rapid release
cycle of approximately 2 months, and it is intended to synchronize
SynPharm updates.

3. Relative
to the larger resources our
less broad-ranging but pharmacologically selective PDB mappings present
much smaller sets for users to easily navigate but still capture approved
drugs and clinical candidates.

4. Every ligand in SynPharm is expert-curated
and activity-mapped even though this activity is not always explicitly
referenced in the publication associated with the PDB entry.

5. This means that our selected
ligands
are also manually identified as authentically binding to specific
protein pockets rather than inorganic ions and/or heteroatoms from
crystallization reagents.

6. Partially due to SynPharm but also
because of the increasing interest in new receptor and enzyme ligand
structures in general, we have been recently enhancing our capture
by triaging all new human PDB depositions.

7. Beyond direct application to synthetic
biology per se, SynPharm has ancillary utility for GtoPdb users to
explore ligand structures.



The Results section below presents the
web pages that we have instantiated for SynPharm, the technical construction
of which is described in the “Methods” section.

Results
Our ligand-identification
process identified 804 ligand–target
interactions that were associated with at least 1 PDB code. Manually
checking these interaction—PDB maps and rejecting duplicates
gave a preliminary list of 768 interactions with associated PDB files.
Among the interactions with structural data, 744 of the 768 (97%)
interactions concern human data, with 15 (2%) rat, 8 (1%) mouse targets,
and 1 Plasmodium falciparum target.
The statistics reported, including for the web page captured in figures,
were distilled from GtoPdb release 2018.1. They will thus change with
subsequent releases, mainly from the curation of new PDB ligands but
also some cases where PDB structures with activity data against new
targets are reported.

Our results established (not unexpectedly)
that the distribution
of interactions for which there is identifiable structural data is
unevenly distributed among target families, as shown below in Table 1.

NHR = nuclear hormone receptors.

As is well known, some target classes are more tractable to X-ray
determination and consequently proportionally more highly represented
with structural data. For example, nuclear hormone receptor (NHR)
interactions are particularly structure-dense in comprising 17% of
the annotated sequences but just 3% of GtoPdb interactions overall.
Enzymes are also over-represented in that just 20% of GtoPdb interactions
involve enzymes, but 60% of those proteins with structural data. By
contrast, voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) have just 3 annotated
sequences (0.5%), compared with 1408 (8%) total interactions. This
bias reflects the inherent difficulties with structural studies of
membrane proteins, although recent advances have led to an increase
in the number of GPCR structures in the last few years, many of which
include ligands.21

Our process of
compiling the SynPharm resource, detailed in the Methods section, is outlined in Figure 1. The output has been used
to populate the home page designed to allow users to search the dataset
by ligand or target protein (Figure 2).

Figure 1 Strategy used to produce a database of potentially useful
interactions
from known binding data.

Figure 2 SynPharm home page with summary statistics at http://synpharm.guidetopharmacology.org/.

Users may browse the site without
a specific molecule in mind or
alternatively take as their starting point identifying any ligand-binding
segment of a protein that might be transferrable to an engineered
protein in their project. In this case, clicking on the “Sequences”
link without entering a search term lists all target proteins in the
list of potentially useful pairs described above. This list can be
browsed as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Top section of the list served to a user entering the target sequence
part of the database. http://synpharm.guidetopharmacology.org/sequences/.

In Figure 3, targets
have been ordered by the length of ligand-binding segment but they
can be ordered by any of the columns by clicking on the table headers.
These metrics can provide useful first-pass information to prioritize
more detailed analyses. Selecting any target brings the user to its
sequence page. At the head of this page is a three-dimensional visualization
of the target chain bound in complex with the ligand, with the binding
segment itself highlighted in green to show its context within the
original chain (Figure 4A).

Figure 4 Examples of the types of structural display found on the sequence
details page for human β-secretase 1 in complex with the ligand
AMG-8718 (sequence ID 84541). The top-left panel shows the three-dimensional
structure interactive viewer where the binding segment is highlighted
in purple, the rest of the target protein in green, and the ligand
is shown in stick view. The top-right panel shows the residue distance
matrix. The distance between any two residues in the target chain
is denoted by color, green to red, and, on desktop screens, hovering
over any pixel will provide an exact numerical distance in angstroms
of the relevant residues. White portions denote residues missing from
the PDB file of origin. The dotted line indicates the binding sequence.
The central panel shows the binding portion of the sequence. The arrows
allow the sequence sections to be extended outward beyond the first
and last interaction residues (five are shown on each end in this
case) The lower panel shows a zoomed-in section of the feature viewer.
Binding residues are shown in context with secondary structure elements
(α-helices and β-strands) and hydrophobicity over the
peptide sequence.

The views in Figure 4 provide a rapid
visual indication of how independent of the other
features of the protein the binding segment’s structure is
likely to be and thus more transferable to other proteins. Visualization
of the structure uses the JavaScript PV protein viewer.22 In addition to showing the structures, the sequence
pages present metrics such as proportional chain length and contact
ratio (used as a rough measure of likelihood that the sequence will
fold correctly by itself, as it is a measure of “domain-likeness”:
higher is more promising). The GtoPdb affinity data for the specific
ligand–target interaction are also provided. Each sequence
also has a residue distance matrix (Figure 4B), which depicts the distances between any
two given residues in the binding chain, with the bind sequence itself
highlighted with a black dotted line. This is to give a sense of the
globularity of the sequence within the chain, and how compact it is.

There is also a feature viewer (Figure 4D) for each sequence, which utilizes the
biojs-vis-protein features viewer.23 In
addition to binding residues and secondary structure elements, the
feature viewer also maps hydrophobicity along the bind sequence, using
the Kyte–Doolittle measures of amino-acid hydrophobicity.24 There are extensive search functions for identifying
sequences or ligands by various metrics. All ligands have links back
to GtoPdb, and a subset of their data is available directly on the
SynPharm page, particularly molecular data and clinical approval information.
These were chosen because they may be relevant to a researcher when
picking a molecular switch inducer, but the full range of pharmacological
data is accessible via the link back to GtoPdb. This can be illustrated
for BACE1, an aspartyl protease drug target for Alzheimer’s
disease.25 In Figure 5, a section of the BACE1 entry is shown and Figure 6 shows a sequence
alignment of the extracted ligand interaction sections.

Figure 5 Snapshot from
the GtoPdb BACE1 target entry, with ligands ranked
by affinity values. http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=2330.

Figure 6 Differences in the contact residues extracted
for the eight BACE1
ligands. The eight SynPharm sequences (in descending order) are 84891,
78993, 78985, 78477, 78900, 82636, 78987, and 84541. The latter (lowermost)
is for AMG-8718 as shown in Figure 3. As for the SynPharm display, the uppercase letters
indicate ligand contact residues.

The eight SynPharm entries are indicated in the upper panel.
From
the total ligand entries in the lower panel, affinity values are displayed
for three of the SynPharm ligands, compound 16 [PMID: 23412139], AZ-4217,
and AMG-8718. The PDB ligands crystallized in a target are indicate
with the red circular logo intersected with a helix (note that verubecestat
did not pass the SynPharm fault filters but the PDB entry can still
be inspected).

A number of SynPharm advantages can be discerned
from the BACE1
example, particularly because it is one of the most intensively perused
drug targets (reflecting the massive unmet need for effective Alzheimer’s
treatments). Metrics in support of this are that no less than 364
BACE1 structures are in PDB (nearly all with ligands), 11 of which
were deposited in 2017. The ChEMBL 23 human BACE1 entry is linked
to 6846 structures with some level of activity mapping. The GtoPdb
BACE1 entry maps 21 quantitative ligand interactions with a focus
on clinical candidates and stringently selected research leads. Of
these, 11 are in PDB (indicated with the orange circular logo) and
5 are not in ChEMBL. From the 11, the 8 indicated in Figures 4 and 5 have passed the SynParm triage (described in the Methods section) and, as multiple ligands for the same target,
provide a useful calibration.

For example, the alignments shown
in Figure 5 indicate
explicit differences among ligand
interaction residues for the set even though the alignment of the
sequence sections indicates they are binding to the same pocket. We
can note that all eight interact with Tyr 132 whereas only 82636 interacts
with Glu 134 and Gly 135 and Tyr 137 only interacts with 78987 and
84541. These differences may be spatially minor (i.e., possibly only
just outside the 5 Å limit used by SynPharm) but can nonetheless
be useful. Even more useful to the synthetic biologist is to compare
the overall length of the contiguous binding section for particular
ligands. In Figure 5, we can see that five sequences extend out to Ala 396 as the ultimate
interaction point. However, the results also indicate that only extending
to DSGTT (or just past it in cassette terms) may be sufficient.

Although SynPharm would be sufficient as a stand-alone tool, there
are external resources that complement it. The most obvious of these
are the primary data sources of RCSB PDB and PDBe, both of which both
of which have complementary features for visualizing ligand binding
in a sequence context. We would also recommend PDBSum for other types
of display.26 These include advanced two-dimensional
secondary structure diagrams, the LIGPLOT display of ligand binding,
and indications of sequence conservation. In cases where there are
many ligands co-crystalized in the same protein (e.g., for BACE1),
the PocketOme encyclopedia of small-molecule binding sites will give
a detailed breakdown of ligand sets.27 For
a deep exploration of both sequence- and structure-based homology,
we suggest the Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction,
and analysis.28 For ligands per se (with
or without PDB entries), we have made another important utility accessible
from within GtoPdb in the form of ChEMBL outlinks. For BACE1, this
means that we were able to find one of the highest reported potencies
for a lead compound with a 0.3 nM IC50 against the purified enzyme
(ligand ID 9982, compound 15 [PMID 25699151]). This would be of interest
to test against an engineered protein despite the absence of a PDB
entry.

Discussion
The work described in this paper has resulted
in a new open web
resource mainly designed to help synthetic biologists to engineer
pharmacological regulation into their proteins. The idea of adding
regulation into engineered proteins has already proved itself useful
in a variety of contexts. A famous example is the addition of the
tamoxifen-sensitive ERT2 domain into Cre recombinase to create a drug-inducible
gene excision, allowing experimenters to remove gene function from
an experimental animal at the time of their choosing.29 This has been used in a variety of applications. Some have
used the system to genetically mark cells for lineage tracing in development,30,31 disease,32 and regeneration.3,33 Other applications have used ligand-inducible Cre to examine gene
function by removing it from a cell only at a chosen stage of development.34,35 Induced Cre-mediated recombination has also been used to create
sarcomas in model animals for the purposes of studying tumor development.36 The technique has even been used in anatomical
studies, deliberately suboptimal doses of inducer being used to mark
only sparse neuronal cells, allowing their detailed morphology to
be studied in otherwise unlabeled tissue.37 The use of photocaged estrogen adds an optogenetic dimension to
a version of the system using Cre-ER instead of Cre-ERT2, allowing
light to be used to activate Cre-ERT2 in specific cells.38

The addition of ligand control is not
limited to Cre. A similar
technique has been used to add the ER domain to Snail, to study the
role of that mediator of epithelial–mesenchymal transitions
in controlling fibrosis in adult kidney disease.39 A recent example of a construct design success using SynParm
is provided by our own work in placing the effectors of CRISPR, Cas9
and Cpf1, under the control of tamoxifen and mifepristone (Dominguez-Monedero et al., manuscript
submitted). The impact of these examples establishes that engineering
control into proteins can be useful. It is our hope that the tools
described here will be useful in the construction of further examples,
broadening the range of ligands that can be used for this type of
work.

Several caveats should be taken into consideration with
our approach.
One of these is the necessary restriction to contiguous sections of
sequence. However, it is well known that overall binding energies
are likely to have at least some contribution from long-range secondary
structure interactions within the entire protein structure. Thus,
the binding sequence cassette not only needs to fold correctly within
the engineered host sequence, but it may also have a lower binding
constant and altered kinetics (e.g., Kon and/or Koff) compared with the full
length native counterpart. This also means that the discontinuous
binding sites characteristic of receptors, ion channels, and transporters
are largely excluded from our data harvest (but the associated ligands
are not necessary ruled out for synthetic applications). Another caveat
is that GtoPdb literature selection focuses on clinical candidates
where optimization often result in a lower potency than the initial
lead compounds. This bias is thus not optimal for ligand-binding
cassettes. Notwithstanding, for in vitro synthetic biology applications,
complementary data can be explored, including searching for very potent
inhibitors that are neither in GtoPdb nor in the PDB but have a high
likelihood of binding the same sequence section (and this could be
supported by structural superimposition and/or docking experiments).
We note also the caveat that the nesting-in of active site sections,
by definition, could endow the host protein with enzyme activity.
In such cases, it should be possible to abolish such unwanted properties
by mutating active site residues that are not major contributors to
the binding energy. Alternatively, because GtoPdb has annotated a
number of allosteric ligands, these noncatalytic binding modules could
be exploited.

We can point out utilities of SynPharm that extend
beyond practical
applications to synthetic biology per se. First, the entries simply
act as a convenient flag to users for the existence of relevant PDB
structures, along with the orange logo. Second, there is increasing
interest in the effects of protein sequence variants that affect protein
function in pharmacologically significant ways, for example, patient
drug responses if substitutions are found in the SynPharm sequences
for individuals and population groups. Third, by adding rodent or
other model organism sequences to the sequence alignments shown in Figure 5, insight can be
gained into orthologous cross-reactivity of ligands that could be
experimentally tested. An example for BACE1 is that the longest sequence
section from Figure 5 has 82% identity with the Zebrafish orthologue (UniProt Q6NZT7).
Although no structure of this protein is yet available, the SynPharm
results indicate that there are differences in the vicinity of the
binding residues. Notwithstanding, the similarity suggests that functional
perturbations could be carried out (e.g., with compound 15 [PMID 25699151])
in this important model organism for human disease conditions. Matching
ligand-binding sequences to distant homologs raises the possibility
of predicting binding sites in proteins rather than relying on known
ones. Although this goes beyond the functionality of SynPharm per
se, this could be generally applicable in GtoPdb. Probable binding
pockets of compounds with potent affinities may be predictable for
human paralogues or species orthologues on the basis of homology modeling
(e.g., using Phyre228).

We would
be pleased to hear from other teams who would like to
use SynPharm, and we may be able to assist in cross-checking complementary
sources to expedite their choices. In addition, we would be like to
record future examples of success that we could reference.

Methods
We used a sequential bioinformatic strategy for identifying ligand-binding
sequence sections potentially useful to synthetic biology (Figure 1). Stage 1 was a
screen for targets in GtoPdb for which any structural ligand-binding
data were available in the form of RCSB PDB files. This screen was
performed by using GtoPdb web services to request PDB codes for each
ligand associated with a target in GtoPdb (2018.1 release). To obtain
further structural data on this first set of potentially interesting
interactions, the RCSB PDB web services were queried with information
from GtoPdb. For each ligand–target interaction, PDB codes
associated with ligands were obtained by searching on ligand code,
name, SMILES, InChI, or peptide sequence. PDB codes associated with
targets were obtained by searching the RCSB PDB web services using
UniProtKB accessions.

Stage 2 was to identify amino-acid residues
on the target that
mediate each of the ligand–target binding interactions. The
residues that mediate the ligand binding were identified by either
using the information in REMARK 800 and SITE records of the relevant
PDB file or, if no such records exist, by selecting all residues with
atoms within 5 Å of a ligand atom (ignoring hydrogen atoms).
The binding sequence was then defined as the segment of the protein
chain that contained all the ligand-binding residues, for example,
a segment between amino acids 30 and 45 of a protein chain. If binding
residues were on more than one peptide chain of a multipeptide target
protein complex, the interaction was rejected as not being useful
for the purposes of protein engineering. Interactions were also rejected
if more than 5% of the residues in the chain are “missing”,
that is, not observed in the PDB file (according to REMARK 465 records).
This was the most frequent reason for discarding candidates. Stage
2 cut the list of potentially useful interactions down to 618 sequences.
This is a relatively small proportion (3.5%) of the number of interactions
in the 2018.2 release of GtoPdb, a reflection of the small number
of PDB target–ligand interactions that pass our filtration
rules for SynPharm.

Stage 3 associated certain metrics with
each sequence. These were
as follows: (i) its length as a proportion of the original chain,
(ii) its “contact ratio”—defined as the ratio
of internal contacts (all nonhydrogen atom pairs within the sequence
within 5 Å of each other, excluding atoms within two covalent
bonds of each other) to external contacts (all nonhydrogen atom pairs
between the sequence and the rest of the chain, less than 5 Å).
In cases where an interaction had multiple PDB maps and so multiple
potential sequences to represent it, we selected those with the smallest
length proportional to their original chain length as the most likely
to be useful for engineering purposes. The system also allows manual
selection of an interaction—PDB map if this is required.

The functions for accessing the GtoPdb web services have been bundled
into a stand-alone Python library called pyGtoP,40 and the code for parsing PDB files and identifying the
various elements within them (used in sequence construction) has been
bundled into a Python PDB parser called molecuPy. Both are open source
projects viewable on GitHub. The scripts that used these new libraries
to do the work described above, as well as the code for the database
and web interface itself, are also open source and viewable on GitHub
in the SynPharm repository.41,42

Construction of a Web Interface
Our aim was to make
the data available in a useful format to synthetic biologists, in
the form of an easy-to-use web page. We have therefore stored the
data in a PostgreSQL43 database, with a
separate staging database to make future updates easier. This is connected
to a web page using a Java (Oracle Corporation, Redwood City, CA)
web application installed on an Apache Tomcat web server (The Apache
Software Foundation), and the web page is open access at ref (44).
