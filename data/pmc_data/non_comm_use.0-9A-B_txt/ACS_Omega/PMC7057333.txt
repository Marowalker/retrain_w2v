Lysine-specific demethylase
1 (LSD1) is an epigenetic enzyme which
regulates the methylation of Lys4 of histone 3 (H3) and is overexpressed
in certain cancers. We used structures of H3 substrate analogues bound
to LSD1 to design macrocyclic peptide inhibitors of LSD1. A linear,
Lys4 to Met-substituted, 11-mer (4) was identified as
the shortest peptide distinctly interacting with LSD1. It was evolved
into macrocycle 31, which was >40 fold more potent (Ki = 2.3 μM) than 4. Linear and macrocyclic
peptides exhibited unexpected differences in structure–activity
relationships for interactions with LSD1, indicating that they bind
LSD1 differently. This was confirmed by the crystal structure of 31 in complex with LSD1-CoREST1, which revealed a novel binding
mode at the outer rim of the LSD1 active site and without a direct
interaction with FAD. NMR spectroscopy of 31 suggests
that macrocyclization restricts its solution ensemble to conformations
that include the one in the crystalline complex. Our results provide
a solid basis for the design of optimized reversible LSD1 inhibitors.

==== Body
Introduction
Lysine-specific demethylase
1 (LSD1, KDM1A) is an FAD-dependent
amine oxidase and the first reported human histone demethylase.1 It is classified as an epigenetic enzyme as it
is involved in the regulation of gene expression via covalent post-translational
modification of histones. Epigenetic enzymes and proteins recognizing
the modification state of histones are important drug targets for
cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, inflammation, and metabolic diseases.2,3 LSD1 was originally identified to specifically demethylate the lysine
residue at position 4 of the N-terminal tail of histone H3, thereby
repressing transcription.1 However, its
substrate specificity is modified through interactions with other
proteins.4 For example, it selectively
removes methyl groups from both mono- and dimethylated H3 lysine 45 when in complex with the accessory protein CoREST,5 while it selectively demethylates histone H3
lysine 9 when interacting with the androgen receptor.6 Moreover, LSD1 also acts on specific lysine residues of
several nonhistone proteins.4 In addition,
it has been reported that demethylases also have biological functions
independent of their demethylase activity.7 Thus, LSD1 takes on different biological roles depending on the
context.

The design of effective and specific drugs that act
on epigenetic
enzymes is challenging. Their substrate recognition is often mediated
by large, solvent accessible, and charged active sites suitable for
the selective binding of peptides but not small nonpeptidic compounds.
Additionally, the nuclear localization of epigenetic enzymes makes
them difficult to access, while their noncatalytic and cytosolic interactions
with other regulatory proteins add to the complexity of this target
class. In the case of LSD1, it has a large, negatively charged active
site cavity, well-suited to achieve specificity through extensive
interactions with the first 10–20 residues of the histone tail.
The properties of the binding site complicates the design of small
molecule inhibitors of LSD1, but several different classes have been
reported8 and a few are currently undergoing
phase I or II clinical trials for different indications.9

The first-described LSD1 inhibitors were
nonselective monoamine
oxidase (MAO) A and B inhibitors that covalently modify the prosthetic
FAD in the structurally conserved amine oxidase domain of LSD1.10 The most potent inhibitor identified was tranylcypromine,
approved as a drug for the treatment of depression. Optimization of
such suicide inhibitors have resulted in inhibitors that display excellent
selectivity for LSD1 over structurally related MAOs.8,11−13 Interestingly, complete specificity can potentially
be achieved because the attachment of tranylcypromine to Lys4 of 9-
to 21-mer peptides derived from histone 3 has been found to give a
>200-fold preference for LSD1 over both MAO A and B.14 Because the improved selectivity of the tranylcypromine-derived
inhibitors has been achieved through structural modifications that
increase both their molecular weight and polar surface area, they
may be less likely to cross the blood–brain barrier than tranylcypromine,
thereby reducing the risks for CNS MAO-related side effects. However,
suicide LSD1 inhibitors carry a risk of covalent modification also
of other proteins, which potentially could result in idiosyncratic
toxicity.9,15

Reversible inhibitors of LSD1 have
also been developed, of which
polyamine derivatives were amongst the first to be reported. Optimization
by the introduction of urea, thiourea, and biphenyl groups has led
to inhibitors with modest (μM range) potencies.16 Polymyxin B and E, which are cyclic polyamine antibiotics,
also inhibit LSD1 with Ki values in the
submicromolar range.17 Although these compounds
have shown beneficial effects on tumor cell lines, they are expected
to be of limited pharmaceutical value because of their highly charged
and polar nature. Pyrimidine- and triazole-based inhibitors have better
selectivity toward LSD1 in comparison to MAO A and B but exhibit similar
μM IC50 values.18−20 Inhibitors based on
indene-containing benzohydrazides are promising, as they have shown
nM inhibitory potencies for LSD1, excellent selectivity relative to
the two MAOs and good activity in tumor cell viability assays.21 An inhibitor based on the pyrimidinone scaffold
is the first reversible inhibitor to reach clinical trials.9

Although peptides are generally unsuitable
as orally administered
drugs, they can be of great value as starting points for drug discovery
projects, in particular when structure-based design can be used for
their optimization into less peptidic and more drug-like compounds.
Development of orally administered inhibitors of HIV and HCV proteases
using a peptide-based approach constitute important success stories.22 Initial endeavors to design and optimize potent
peptide inhibitors of LSD1 have been reported.14,23,24 For instance, the inhibitory effect of a
21-mer peptide derived from the N-terminus of histone 3 (H31-21) was effectively increased by the substitution of Lys4, the methyl
group acceptor, by a Met residue (here designated H31-21 K4M). The inhibition constant (Ki) was
thus decreased from 1.8 μM to 50 nM.24 A cyclic 21-mer peptide based on H31-21 K4M (cyclized
via a Lys5–Glu10 lactam) was a somewhat weaker inhibitor of LSD1 (Ki = 400 nM) but had equal potency in cell viability
assays as the corresponding linear peptide and better metabolic stability.25 Sub- or low μM Ki values have also been reported for hexa- to nonamer peptides
derived from SNAIL1, a transcription factor that interacts with LSD1
via a domain similar to histone H3.23

Macrocycles offer improved opportunities for binding drug targets
that have a large and somewhat featureless binding site, as compared
to nonmacrocyclic analogues.26,27 In addition, as exemplified
by the lactamized H31-21 K4M peptide discussed above,
macrocyclization usually confers higher metabolic stability to peptides
or their mimetics and may also provide improved cell permeability
and oral bioavailability.28−32 We have therefore initiated a program to use peptides as starting
points for the design of specific, reversible, and safe macrocycles
that target the large pocket-shaped binding site of LSD1 using a ligand-based
design. Specifically, our approach was to (i) use different crystal
structures of peptides in complex with LSD1-CoREST for the design
of macrocyclic peptidomimetic inhibitors of LSD1, (ii) prepare and
evaluate peptides that vary in length, functionality, and conformational
restriction to generate structure–activity relationships suitable
for the design of more drug-like macrocyclic inhibitors of LSD1, and
(iii) establish and validate state-of-the-art biophysical and biochemical
LSD1 assays that can be used to guide the optimization of drug-like
LSD1 inhibitors.

Results and Discussion
Design of Peptidic LSD1
Inhibitors
The starting point
for the project was the analysis of approximately 20 available crystal
structures of LSD1-CoREST complexes with active-site bound peptides.
The majority of these peptides originated from the N-terminus of histone
H3, or the transcription factor SNAIL1, and fall into two different
secondary structure classes. The first includes H3 and SNAIL1-derived
peptides that adopt a helical turn at their N-terminus. They were
found in structures where the peptides form noncovalent complexes
with LSD1-CoREST (e.g. H31-21 K4M, PDB: 2V1D,24 or a SNAIL1 20-mer, PDB: 2Y48(33)). The second
class consists of a propargylamine-derivatized H3 peptide (H31-21 K4(Pr), PDB: 2UXN).34 This peptide
is covalently bound to the FAD cofactor in LSD1 and adopts a different
turn conformation. Polymyxin B and E display a different backbone
orientation as compared to H31-21 K4M and H31-21 K4(Pr) and occupy part of the volume of the binding
site filled by these peptides.17 In all
studied structures, the amino acid residues of the LSD1 active site
have similar conformations, suggesting that structure-based design
can be used to design inhibitors of LSD1.24,33,34

Two 21-mer peptides which come from
each of the two secondary structure classes and are based on the same
histone H3 sequence [H31-21 K4M and H31-21 K4(Pr)] were selected as starting points for the inhibitor design.
In the LSD1-CoREST cocrystal structures of both peptides, residue
4 contacts the FAD co-factor localized in a hydrophobic pocket of
the active site (Figure 1). The positively charged α-amino group of Ala1 and the guanidinium
group of Arg2 of the two peptides are anchored in an anionic pocket
of LSD1 consisting of several aspartic acid residues, while the aliphatic
part of the Arg2 side chain contributes via hydrophobic interactions.
However, the backbone conformations of the two peptides show major
differences, with the Ala1–Gln5 segment of H31-21 K4M forming two consecutive β-turns (Figure 1A, left panel), while the Arg2–Thr6
segment of H31-21 K4(Pr) is folded into three consecutive
γ-turns (Figure 1B, left panel). As a result of the more compact folding of H31-21 K4(Pr), the interactions between the peptide backbone
and the LSD1 active site are reduced, while the interactions involving
side chains are maximized. This feature may be advantageous when using
H31-21 K4(Pr) for the design of drug-like, nonpeptidic
inhibitors.34 To exploit the different
features of the peptides and increase the overall likelihood of success,
we used both secondary structures as starting points for the design.

of two linear H3-derived peptides bound in different conformations
by LSD1-CoREST. (A) Structure of residues 1–7 of H31-21 K4M (PDB: 2V1D)24 showing the close spatial proximity
of the sidechains of Ala1 and Thr3 (left). Model of the complex between
LSD1 and a macrocyclic peptide in which the α-carbons of residues
1 and 3 have been linked by a 4-carbon atom bridge (right). (B) Structure
of residues 1–7 of H31-21 K4(Pr) (PDB: 2UXN)34 showing the spatial proximity of the sidechains of Thr3
and Thr6 (left). Model of the complex between LSD1 and a macrocyclic
peptide in which the α-carbons of residues 3 and 6 have been
linked by an 8-carbon atom bridge (right). The distances between the
β-carbons of the residues to be connected by bridges are given
for both structures in the left panels. Intramolecular hydrogen bonds
in the backbone are indicated by dashed lines. The peptide backbone
and the side chains of the amino acids not involved in the formation
of the macrocycle retain the positions found in the crystal structures
used as starting points for the design (right panels). The modeled
bridged structures were selected based on conformational sampling
with LowModeMD.

Molecular dynamics simulations
of hypothetical cyclized peptides,
bridged by alkyl chains of varying lengths, were performed. They indicated
that a bridge of 4 atoms between the α-carbons of Ala1 and Thr3
would enforce the conformation displayed by the structure of H31-21 K4M (2V1D), while 5–8 atoms between the α-carbons
of Thr3 and Thr6 would provide a conformation similar to the one found
in the H31-21 K4(Pr) complex (2UXN) (Figure 1, right panels). The feasibility
of the proposed cyclization scheme was judged to be likely to succeed
as the side chains of the amino acids to be bridged are not interacting
with the protein. Macrocyclization thus appeared unlikely to give
rise to steric clashes with LSD1, in particular for peptides cyclized
between residues Thr3 and Thr6 where the bridge would be solvent-exposed.

Assays for Evaluation of Peptides
Surface plasmon resonance-based
biosensor (SPR) interaction and enzyme activity assays were set up
to experimentally assess the interactions between LSD1 and various
peptides. The assays differed in the information provided, giving
insight into both the direct interactions between peptides and LSD1,
and the peptides’ capability to inhibit the catalytic function
of LSD1. The data from the two assays should correlate as the peptides
are designed to bind to the active site of LSD1 and directly compete
with the substrate.

The biosensor-based interaction kinetic
assay was developed by immobilizing LSD1 via amine coupling to the
sensor chip. A variety of control experiments were carried out. Injection
of the irreversible, mechanism-based LSD1 inhibitor GSK-LSD135 confirmed that the enzyme was functional after
immobilization and sensitive to the inhibitor as it blocked the surface
and prevented the subsequent binding of peptides (see below). This
was further supported by the data showing that H31-21 K4M (peptide 1, cf. Table 1) interacted reversibly with the immobilized
enzyme in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2A). This experiment also demonstrated that
peptide 1 was suitable as a reference compound and that
the sensor surfaces had a sensitivity suitable for the analysis of
interactions with peptides of similar molecular weights. Peptide 1 was subsequently injected before and after each test compound
concentration series to verify that the sensor surface remained functional
during the experimental series. Injections of concentration series
of peptides 4 (a second positive control) and 13 (negative control) were also included in each experimental series
to address the reproducibility of the assay. This ensured that data
obtained using different sensor surfaces could be reliably compared.
Analysis of the data obtained with different surfaces for different
protein and ligand batches showed that the standard deviation of KD for the reference peptides did not exceed
30% of their values. Finally, control peptides 1 and 4 did not interact with the LSD1-modified surfaces after injection
of GSK-LSD1 or tranylcypromine, thus confirming that they interacted
specifically with the active site of the protein.

at pH 8.0. (C) Initial velocities were determined at substrate concentrations
from 0 to 200 μM (inset in C), and the Michaelis–Menten
equation was fitted to the data by nonlinear regression analysis.

The
kinetic rate constants and the affinities (ka, kd and KD) for the interactions were determined when feasible,
i.e., when the sensorgrams could be fitted using
a 1-step Langmuir interaction model with 1:1 stoichiometry. To overcome
the inadequacy of this model, several approaches to determine the
kinetic parameters were tried. These included using two-step models
and an alternative experimental design where the injection length
was varied to monitor the association time dependency of the dissociation
kinetics. However, this did not help, and a quantitative kinetic analysis
was therefore only carried out when the information was useful. Only
affinities were approximated for weak interactions, i.e., those that did not reach saturation at the highest tested concentration
of 200 μM. In these cases, the maximal response values were
estimated using the saturation levels for peptide 1.
For peptides giving a clear signal upon injection, but a saturation
level <50% of the expected value, the KD values were qualitatively estimated to be above the highest tested
concentration, i.e., >200 μM. The data for
the designed series of peptides are presented in Tables 1–4.

An enzyme activity assay, monitoring the demethylation
of a peptide
corresponding to the N-terminal 21 amino acids of histone H3, mono-N-methylated at Lys4 [H31-21 K4(Me)],
was also developed for this study (Figure 2B,C). The reaction was monitored continuously
in a Tris-based buffer system with an enzyme concentration of 25 nM
(estimated by an active site titration using the irreversible inhibitor
GSK-LSD1).35 To better understand the details
of the enzyme–substrate interaction and thus optimizing the
conditions for the detection of weakly interacting inhibitors, the
demethylation activity was studied at several concentrations of NaCl
(Figure 2B). There
was no effect on Vmax (i.e. kcat), but the Km values increased
with ionic strength, being 10 μM without added NaCl, 20 μM
in 50 mM NaCl, and 80 μM in 150 mM NaCl. This indicates that
substrate recognition is predominantly mediated by electrostatic interactions.
An intermediate concentration of 50 mM NaCl was chosen for experiments
as the presence of NaCl reduces the affinity for the substrate, and
higher ionic strength would require impractically high substrate concentrations.
Using these conditions and after conversion to standard units using
a hydrogen peroxide calibration curve, the kinetic constants were
determined to kcat = 0.6 s–1 and Km = 20 μM (Figure 2B). The conditions for the
standard assay used thus deviated from those previously reported.36

Analysis of the potential inhibition of
LSD1 by test peptides was
performed at a substrate concentration of 20 μM (i.e. equal
to the Km). Inhibition data was normalized
and reported as % inhibition, using 10 μM of the GSK-LSD1 irreversible
inhibitor and 2% (v/v) DMSO as positive (100% inhibition) and negative
controls, respectively. For inhibitors showing a significant effect,
IC50 values were estimated from experiments using a serial
dilution of compounds, with duplicated measurements approximated by
a two-parametric sigmoidal curve equation. To track the reproducibility
between experiments, each experimental series included inhibition
analysis of peptide 1. For the most potent compounds,
substrate saturation curves were monitored at four different inhibitor
concentrations and analyzed globally employing the Michaelis–Menten
model for competitive inhibition, thereby confirming the mode of inhibition
and quantifying Ki values experimentally.
If Ki values were not determined by this
procedure, they were estimated from IC50 values using the
Cheng–Prusoff relationship for competitive inhibitors. However,
inhibition constants were not quantified for the peptides that had
inhibition curves with a Hill-like slope coefficient significantly
above 1, as it indicates a significant deviation of the inhibition
mechanism from an expected competitive model. It should be noted that
the experimental conditions were slightly different in the biosensor
and activity assays, with variations in buffer composition and analysis
temperatures (SPR assays were performed at 15 °C and enzyme activity
assays were performed at 22 °C). However, it has not had a major
impact on the interpretations of our results because the SAR analyses
for the macrocyclic lactams and triazoles, that is, the key compounds
discovered herein, were based on the inhibition data.

Identification
of a Suitable Peptide Length
As replacement
of Lys4 with Met in peptides derived from the N-terminus of histone
H3 provides a major increase in affinity for LSD1,24 we chose the N-terminal 21-mer H31-21 K4M (1) as a starting point for the design and synthesis
of peptidomimetics targeting LSD1. In order to identify a scaffold
suitable for evolution, the minimal peptide length having an adequate
affinity for the enzyme to allow reliable structure–activity
relationship analyses had to be identified. To this end, peptide 1 and the N- and C-terminally truncated analogues (2–8) were synthesized and analyzed for interactions
with LSD1 (Table 1).
The 11-mer peptide having the native Lys at position 4 (9), that is, a product-like peptide, and an 11-mer reference peptide
(10), designed by scrambling macrocyclic peptides 27 or 28 and thus having a similar amino acid
composition as H31-11 K4M (4), were
also prepared as controls. The peptides were synthesized on a solid
phase in an automatic peptide synthesizer via the Fmoc protocol using
acid labile protective groups for amino acids having nucleophilic
sidechains.37 Cleavage of the peptides
from the solid support, with concomitant deprotection of the sidechains,
was performed with a trifluoroacetyl (TFA) cocktail containing cation
scavengers. After cleavage, the crude peptides were purified with
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and characterized
by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (Table 5).

LSD1 had the highest affinity for the 21-mer peptide H31-21 K4M (1) (Table 1). The interaction was well described by a simple Langmuir
model, i.e., a reversible 1-step interaction with a 1:1 binding stoichiometry
(Figure 2A). In this
study, the KD value for 1 was determined to be 140 nM, and the rate constants were ka = 1.2 × 106 M–1 s–1 and kd = 0.15
s–1. It can be noted that the kd value is of the same order as the kcat (0.6 s–1), suggesting that product
dissociation might be the rate-limiting step for enzyme catalysis.
The demethylation assay confirmed that peptide 1 was
a competitive inhibitor, with a Ki = 600
nM.

The affinity decreased gradually upon truncation of H31-21 K4M (1) at the C-terminus, indicating
a role for the
C-terminus in the interaction with LSD1 (Table 1). Removal of six amino acids to give 15-mer
H31-15 K4M (peptide 2) led to an increase
in KD from 140 nM to 5 μM. The KD was further increased 7- and 4-fold for two
additional rounds of removal of residues that gave the 13- and 11-mer
peptides H31-13 K4M (3) and H31-11 K4M (4), while the 9- and 7-mers H31-9 K4M (5) and H31-7 K4M (6) displayed very weak binding (KD > 200 μM). The affinity of 11-mer H31-11 K4M (peptide 4) was low, with apparent kinetics and
secondary effects seen at higher concentrations. However, the KD could be estimated to 140 μM, in contrast
to H31-9 K4M and H31-7 K4M (peptides 5 and 6), for which the affinities were not quantifiable.

Unexpected apparent association and dissociation phases and secondary
effects were observed for H31-11 K4M (4, Figure 3A). The
interaction was explored by analyzing the influence of the association
time on the dissociation phase, thus investigating the possibility
of a complex interaction mechanism. However, this was not detected,
as the dissociation was found to be identical for 30 s, 1-, 2-, and
4 min injections. To exclude the possibility of data misinterpretation,
the reference peptide 10 was used as a negative control.
No interaction was observed, emphasizing the selectivity of LSD1 for
peptide motifs derived from the N-terminus of histone H3.

Insets correspond to interaction isotherms, fitted with the Langmuir
model (red lines).

N-terminal truncation
of the parent H31-21 K4M
(peptide 1) was explored via removal of one or two N-terminal
amino acids, namely, Ala1 and Arg2. The 20-mer H32-21 K4M (peptide 7) was found to have a KD of 45 μM, which is 320 times higher than H31-21 K4M (1) and nine times higher than
H31-15 K4M (2). Further truncation,
represented by H33-21 K4M (peptide 8), abolished the interaction completely. This emphasizes the important
role of Ala1 and Arg2 in complex formation and clearly demonstrates
that the N-terminal amino acids in H31-21 K4M (1) have a much larger contribution to the affinity for LSD1
than those at the C-terminus.

As H31-11 K4M
(4) was the smallest
truncated version of the histone H3 N-terminus that displayed a clear
interaction, it was chosen as the minimal sequence suitable for further
evolution. It was found to be a poor inhibitor in the enzyme activity
assay, with IC50 > 100 μM. To further justify
the
incorporation of the K4M substitution into the monosubstituted and
macrocyclized peptides to be synthesized in this study, the wild-type
11-mer H31-11 K4 (peptide 9) was compared
to the substituted H31-11 K4M (Figure 3B). As seen earlier for the
corresponding 21-mer peptides, the wild-type 11-mer 9 was found to have a lower affinity than the K4M-substituted peptide 4. No signs of saturation of the interaction with the LSD1-modified
surface were seen at concentrations up to 100 μM, and the interaction
of H31-11 K4 (9) with LSD1 could therefore
not be reliably characterized.

SAR Analysis via Monosubstituted
H31-11 Peptides
Inspection of the crystal
structures of the complexes between H31-21 K4M24 and H31-21 K4(Pr)34 with LSD1 indicates that residues
Ala1, Arg2, Met4, and Arg8 form important contacts with the LSD1 active
site. In order to obtain a first insight into the structure–activity
relationships of the interaction between H31-11 K4M
(4) and LSD1, we probed the importance of these four
residues using a series of monosubstituted peptides (Table 2).

The critical role of the N-terminal residue found for the 21-mer
peptide 1 was further explored with the 11-mer series.
The affinity was drastically increased by substituting Ala1 for Pro,
the N-terminal residue in SNAIL 1 (peptide 11); the KD dropped from 140 to 10 μM (Figure 3C, Table 2). In addition, the kinetics
became faster, and indications for secondary effects at higher concentrations
disappeared (Figure 3A,C). Peptide 11 was established to be a competitive
inhibitor with Ki = 8 μM. By instead
substituting Ala1 for a sterically bulky l-tert-leucine (Tle, peptide 12), it was investigated whether
the increased affinity of the A1P-substituted peptide resulted only
from hydrophobic contacts or if it also had an electrostatic or conformational
contribution. The absence of a detectable interaction for the A1Tle-substituted
peptide (Figure 3D)
indicated the advantage of Pro in increasing the charge and/or restricting
the conformation at the N-terminus, rather than simply increasing
the hydrophobicity. It was later found that the replacement of Ala1
together with Thr3 by l-allyl glycine (peptide 18) resulted in an even higher affinity (see below), supporting the
importance of the features of the N-terminal residues.

The importance
of the contacts mediated by the two arginine residues
(Arg2 and Arg8) was explored by replacing them by citrulline, which
has a neutral side chain (peptides 13 and 14). Replacement of either of these arginine residues resulted in a
complete loss of interaction, demonstrating that both arginine residues
contribute essential electrostatic interactions.

Finally, the
contribution of the residue in position 4 of H31-11 K4M (4) to the interaction with LSD1
was explored with several substitutions. The residue is located in
a large, hydrophobic subpocket of LSD1 composed of A539, Y761, A809,
T810, and the FAD isoalloxazine moiety. The H31-11 K4M peptide 4 was therefore complemented by peptides 15–17, having amino acids with extended
aliphatic or aromatic side chains in position 4, that is, norleucine
(Nle), 2-S-amino octanoic acid (Aoc), and l-homophenylalanine (homo-Phe). The results revealed that the interaction
is more complicated than expected as all had weak and unquantifiable
affinities. However, methionine was the most favorable side chain
in this position, as residues with an equal or two carbon atoms longer
aliphatic chain (peptides 15 and 16) or
an aromatic moiety (peptide 17) had lower affinities.

Structures of Macrocyclic H31-11 K4M-Based
Peptides
As discussed in the design section above, the two
different secondary structure classes that were observed for peptides
bound in the active site of LSD1 revealed the possibility of restricting
their conformational flexibility by side-chain to side-chain macrocyclization
between residues Ala1 and Thr3 or residues Thr3 and Thr6, respectively
(Figure 1). Sets of
peptides based on the sequence of H31-11 K4M (4) that were cyclized by olefin metathesis to give stapled
peptides (19, 21, 23–26), by lactamization of glutamic acid and lysine (27–34), or by 1,2,3-triazole formation using azide–alkyne
cycloaddition (35 and 36) were designed
(Chart 1). Based on
the results from the conformational sampling of different bridge structures
a four carbon atom alkenyl bridge was incorporated between Ala1 and
Thr3. Residues Thr3 and Thr6 were first connected by alkenyl bridges
of four or eight carbon atoms, whereas lactamization and cycloaddition
both gave eight-atom bridged cyclic peptides.

Peptides That Were Designed Based on

Synthesis of Macrocyclized H31-11 K4M-Based
Peptides
Precursors of stapled peptides having selected olefinic
amino acids at the desired positions were prepared on a solid phase,
as described above for the linear peptides (Scheme 1). The N-terminal Fmoc group and side-chain
protective groups were retained while olefin metathesis was conducted
on solid-phase under microwave irradiation at 200 °C using the
Hoveyda–Grubbs catalyst.38 After
removal of the Fmoc group with piperidine, the peptide resins were
treated with TFA and a cocktail of scavengers to remove the side-chain
protective groups and cleave the cyclic peptides from the resin. Deprotection
and cleavage of the resin bound linear precursors, for use as controls
in the SPR interaction and activity assays, was conducted using the
same procedure. Purification by reversed-phase HPLC gave stapled peptides 19, 21, and 23–26 in 3–10% yields, as well as their acyclic precursors 18, 20, and 22 (Tables 3 and 5).

In the
synthesis of lactam-bridged peptides 27–34 (Table 4), Nα-Fmoc-protected glutamic acid and lysine,
with side chains protected with allyl and allyloxycarbonyl groups,
respectively, were incorporated at positions 3 and 6 of the peptide
resins (Scheme 2).
A Boc-group was used for N-terminal alanine, and after completion
of solid-phase synthesis, the allyl and allyloxycarbonyl groups were
cleaved by treatment with Pd(PPh3)3. Lactamization
of the two deprotected side chains was then achieved on the solid
phase using a dilute solution of HCTU (O-(1H-6-chlorobenzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate). The remaining protective groups were removed
with TFA, with simultaneous cleavage of the peptide from the solid-phase.
After purification by reversed-phase HPLC, the lactamized peptides
were obtained in 6–8% yields (Tables 4 and 5).

In the synthesis of
triazole-bridged peptides 35–36 (Table 4), l-5-azidolysine
and l-progargylglycine were
incorporated at positions 3 and 6 of the peptide resin. After completion
of the solid-phase synthesis, the linear peptides were cleaved from
the resin with TFA and purified by reversed-phase HPLC. Subsequently,
closing of the 1,2,3-triazole bridges between the side chains of azidolysine
and propargylglycine was effected in a Cu(I)-catalyzed click reaction,39,40 and peptides 35 and 36 were obtained in
60 and 50% yield, respectively, after purification by reversed-phase
HPLC (Scheme 3).

Evaluation of Stapled Olefin-Bridged Macrocyclic
H31-11 K4M-Based Peptides
SPR biosensor
analysis of LSD1 interactions
with stapled peptides and their precursors (peptides 18–26, Table 3) highlighted
challenges in monitoring interactions with KD values in the middle to high micromolar range. In addition,
almost all olefin-modified peptides showed unspecific interactions
with both reference and test surfaces, characterized by super-stoichiometric
binding and relatively slow association and dissociation kinetics.
No quantitative analysis was performed for these interaction kinetic
curves, as it could significantly mislead SAR interpretation.41 This behavior most likely originates from the
hydrophobic alkenyl moieties and complicates the data analysis. Controls
where the signal levels from the H31-21 K4M reference
peptide (4) was confirmed to be the same before and after
each peptide concentration series, excluded the possibility that spurious
results were due to the active site of LSD1 being partially blocked
by residual binding of stapled peptides having a slow apparent dissociation.

Despite the high complexity of the biosensor-acquired
data, certain important SAR correlations were observed. It was immediately
obvious that there was no point in pursuing the 4-carbon atom olefin-bridged
peptides further as peptides 19 (Ala1–Thr3 cyclization)
and 21 (Thr3–Thr6 cyclization) did not demonstrate
any specific interaction with immobilized LSD1. In contrast, peptide 18 bearing two allylglycine residues in positions 1 and 3
(the linear precursor of 19) interacted in a well-defined
manner, with a saturable interaction profile and an affinity of 26
μM. In fact, it exhibited an even higher affinity than the parent
H31-11 K4M peptide (4, KD = 140 μM). We speculate that this is due to hydrophobic
contacts between the N-terminal allylglycine moiety and the enzyme
active site, as already discussed for the beneficial A1P-substitution
in H31-11 K4M (see above).

The stapled stereoisomeric
peptides having eight carbon atoms in
the bridge between residues 3 and 6 all bound to LSD1, unlike the
four-atom bridged peptides. Macrocycle 23 interacted
with immobilized LSD1 in a satisfactory manner, with the KD approximated to 15 μM. This is in contrast to
the linear precursor 22 that demonstrated extreme unspecific
binding, as well as multiple carry-over effects. Considering the presence
of two hydrophobic pentenyl substituents in this peptide, nonideal
interaction behavior was not unexpected. We attempted to investigate
the influence of the configuration of the stapled peptides using a
series of stereoisomers of 23, in which the stereochemistry
at the α-carbon atoms of the bridging residues was varied. However,
no clear SAR was found as macrocycle 26 had a high unspecific
binding, while compounds 24 and 25 demonstrated
interactions with saturable binding isotherms, minimum secondary effects,
and KD values similar to 23.

All stapled peptides, as well as their precursors, showed
an apparent
inhibition in the enzyme activity assay, but there was no clear SAR
for inhibition by compounds 18–26 (Table 3). Moreover,
the dose–response inhibition curves had a Hill-like slope coefficient
significantly above 1 for most stapled peptides, indicating a complex
interaction mechanism. For peptides 18–23, 25, and 26, it was therefore not possible
to discriminate between specific inhibition arising from a mechanistically
well-defined interaction and unspecific inhibition due to their hydrophobic
nature. Interestingly, stapled peptide 24, which behaved
well in the biosensor assay, was found to be a competitive inhibitor
of LSD1 (IC50 = 11 μM, Ki = 8.5 μM as determined by global regression analysis). In
summary, stapled peptides were concluded to provide an improvement
in binding to LSD1 but to be too hydrophobic relative to their affinity
for reliable interaction and inhibition analysis. Further optimization
of this series of eight atom bridged macrocyclic peptides was therefore
focused on increasing their polarity by replacement of the olefin
bridge by a lactam or triazole bridge.

Evaluation of Lactam- and
Triazole-Bridged Macrocyclic H31-11 K4M-Based Peptides
Lactam- and triazole-bridged
macrocycles did not show a detectable interaction with LSD1 in the
SPR biosensor assay under the conditions used for interaction analysis
with the linear and olefin-bridged peptides. However, unlike the stapled
peptides, they had an inhibitory activity with a clear SAR in the
enzyme activity-based assay (Table 4). This difference in the possibility to generate data
may be a consequence of the higher solubility of lactams and triazoles,
as compared to olefins.

Cyclizing the linear
parent H31-11 K4M peptide (4) with
the aforementioned groups generated a set of competitive inhibitors,
with potency dependent on the cyclization chemistry and the bridge
orientation. The lactam-bridged peptide 28 was a competitive
inhibitor, with a Ki = 4 μM (Figure 4A,B, Table 4). Lactam 27, in
which the bridging Glu and Lys residues have been interchanged, was
less potent (Ki = 31 μM). Triazoles 35 and 36 were weak competitive inhibitors, with 36 being more potent (Ki = 30
μM).

Figure 4 Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of LSD1 by H31-11 K4M based lactams 27, 28, and 31. (A) Data for the determination of IC50 values, fitted
with a two-parametric sigmoidal equation. (B) LSD1 substrate saturation
curves, obtained at various concentrations of lactam 28 (0, 1, 5 μM. 10 μM) and 31 (0, 1, 2.5,
5 μM). The data was analyzed through a global nonlinear regression
analysis using a model for competitive inhibition to identify the
mechanism of action and the Ki values.

The SAR was explored for the lactam series, but
the triazoles were
not pursued further. First, the importance of the terminal residue
was studied for the macrocycles, as the N-terminal residue was found
to be critical for the interaction of the parental peptide 4 (Figure 3A,C). An
A1P substitution in the linear H31-11 K4M peptide 4 resulted in a major increase in both affinity and inhibition
potency toward LSD1 (Table 2). However, the corresponding A1P substitution of lactams 27 and 28, giving 29 and 30, was not accompanied by any increase in potency, and lactam 28 remained the most potent macrocycle. This difference in
SAR between monosubstituted macrocyclic and linear peptides suggests
that the members of the two series interact differently with LSD1.

Second, the stereochemistry for residue 3 was investigated by replacing
the l-lysine or l-glutamic acid residues in lactams 27 and 28 by the corresponding d-amino
acids. This generated the most potent LSD1 inhibitor among the lactam
series; following such modification, the weak inhibitor 27 was transformed into a competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 2.3 μM (peptide 31, Table 4 and Figure 4A,B). The effect was opposite for peptide 28, its stereoisomer 32 was a very poor inhibitor
of LSD1. Importantly, 31, obtained from linear H31-11 K4M (4) by macrocyclization and inversion
of stereochemistry of residue 3, displayed >40 times higher inhibition
of the enzymatic activity of LSD1 than the parent 4.

Third, the SAR was also explored for Arg2 and Arg8 residues, both
of which contribute essential electrostatic interactions for the linear
parent H31-11 K4M 4 (Table 2). Each of the two charged arginines
in peptide 28 was replaced by neutral citrullines (peptides 33 and 34). Surprisingly, both citrulline analogues
demonstrated similar interaction kinetics and inhibitory potency as
peptide 28 (Table 4).

The SAR of the macrocyclic series was thus different
from the linear
peptides both with respect to the A1P substitution and the introduction
of citrulline, again suggesting that the members of the two series
bound differently to LSD1. Interestingly, the possibility of replacing
the charged arginine residues by neutral counterparts indicates that
the preparation of less polar and more druglike inhibitors is possible
for the series of macrocyclic peptides.

To investigate the disagreement
between the SPR biosensor and enzymatic
assays for the lactam- and triazole bridged macrocycles, the conditions
for the biophysical evaluation were tuned to mimic those used in the
enzyme activity-based assay. The buffer composition was changed to
omit disulfide exchange reagents, and the analysis temperature was
increased to 25 °C. Under these conditions, clear interaction
of some of the lactam-bridged macrocycles with LSD1 was observed (Figure 5). Although the complexity
of the kinetic curves did not allow a straightforward analysis, the
qualitative SAR correlations were precisely the same as in the inhibition
enzyme assay. Lactam 28 interacted specifically with
the immobilized LSD1, while the recognition of 27 was
low or undetectable (Figure 5A). No interaction was observed for peptide 32, while the interaction of peptide 31 had a profile
similar to that of lactam 28 (Figure 5B). Similarly, Arg2Cit and Arg8Cit-substituted
analogues of peptide 28, peptides 33 and 34, gave well-defined dose–response interaction curves
in the optimized experiments (Figure 5C,D).

dilution series, starting from 50 μM. (A) Macrocycle 28 interacted specifically with LSD1, unlike its analogue with interchanged

has interchanged bridging residues. (C,D) interaction kinetic analysis

NMR Studies of Key Linear and Macrocyclic H31-11 K4M Peptides
Complete NMR chemical shift assignments were
obtained for the linear parent H31-11 K4M peptide 4 and the two macrocyclic peptides, stapled 23 and lactam 28 in DMSO-d6 at 298 K and at pH 6.5 in aqueous solution at 276 and 298 K (Supporting Information). Four consecutive amino
acid residues with significant negative or positive Δ(δCα – δCβ) values (chemical
shift differences between measured and average random coil Cα and Cβ chemical shifts) have been reported to be
indicative of the α-helical or β-sheet secondary structure.42 Neither of the three peptides displayed such
a pattern of secondary chemical shifts (Supporting Information, Figure 1), indicating that the three peptides adopt random coil structures
in solution. However, a larger difference for Gln5 in the macrocyclic
peptides 23 and 28 may suggest an increased
propensity for adopting a local γ-turn like conformation at
this position. No such difference was found for the linear parent
peptide 4. The linear H31-11 K4M peptide 4 only showed a weak NHα–NHα rotating-frame nuclear Overhauser effect (ROE) between residues
Ser10 and Thr11 (Supporting Information, Figure 2A) in the
aqueous solution at 276 K, further confirming that the linear peptide
behaves as a random coil even at low temperature. However, both stapled
peptide 23 and lactam 28 displays NHα–NHα ROEs close to the site
of macrocyclization (Supporting Information, Figure 2B,C) indicative
of a turn-like structure involving Gln5. In conclusion, analyses of
secondary chemical shifts and NH–NH ROEs both reveal that the
three peptides mainly adopt random coil structures in solution, most
likely with the formation of a turn-like conformation in the region
of Gln5 for 23 and 28.

Crystal Structure
of LSD1 in Complex with Macrocyclic Inhibitor 31
Most of the structure–activity relationships
of the designed macrocyclic lactams 27–34 could not be interpreted on the basis of crystal structures of LSD1-CoREST
complexes with linear H31-21 K4M peptide 1 (PDB: 2V1D(24)), or the covalently bound H31-21 K4(Pr) analogue of 1 (PDB: 2UXN(34)). Additionally,
no SAR correlation with the linear peptides reported herein was found.
To clarify this and to uncover fine details of the mechanism of action
of the designed LSD1 inhibitors, attempts to determine the structure
of LSD1 with the most potent macrocyclic peptides were made. Initial
crystallization trials were done with LSD1 alone; however, the active
site of the enzyme was rendered inaccessible due to crystal packing
interactions (data now shown). To alter the packing, all subsequent
structural experiments were based on the LSD1-CoREST1 system. Crystals
of the binary protein complex were obtained and soaked with three
macrocyclic peptides (28, 31, and 36), i.e., the two most potent lactams and the most potent
triazole. This led to that a crystal structure of the ternary complex
of LSD1-CoREST1 with lactam 31 was determined at 3.1
Å resolution.

Comparison of the structures of the linear
H31-21 K4M peptide 1 (PDB: 2V1D(24)) and macrocycle 31 in their complexes with
LSD1-CoREST1 revealed striking differences (Figure 6). Peptide 1, which has the
first 16 amino acids well resolved, penetrates deep into the active
site of the LSD1 amine oxidase domain, with Met4 of 1 close to the isoalloxazine moiety of the FAD prosthetic group. Surprisingly,
a different and unexpected binding pose was observed for macrocycle 31, for which the electron density was found at the outer
rim of the active site (Figure 6A,C,D). In addition, the macrocyclic peptide is rotated by
nearly 180° around two axes as compared to 1, with
the first rotation switching positions of N- and C-termini, and the
other flipping the ring with regard to the path the peptide backbone
takes in the active site (Figure 6C). As a result, Met4 of 31 is protruding
out of the active site and is fully solvent-exposed, rather than being
deeply buried and pointing toward the FAD as for linear peptide 1. In addition, the C-terminal residues 8–11 of 31 could not be modelled due to a lack of the electron density
and appear to be mobile and solvent-exposed.

(E) Stereo view showing the details of the interactions between LSD1
and 31. LSD1 residues are shown as sticks with the carbon
atoms in white, and key residues labelled with black one letter codes.
Macrocycle 31 is depicted with thicker sticks and the
carbon atoms in yellow. Residues of 31 are indicated
with three letter codes and are colored orange. Hydrogen bonds are
depicted as dashed lines. The FAD prosthetic group is depicted as
sticks in red.

The α-amino group of Ala1
of 31 is bound in
one of the cationic pockets of LSD1 formed by D375 and E379 (Figure 6E), forming a salt
bridge with the former residue. The same pocket is responsible for
the recognition of the crucial Arg8 in linear, histone H3-based peptides
such as 1. Six additional hydrogen bonds are formed between
the amide backbone of residues Ala1 through Ala7 of 31 and different functional groups in LSD1 (Figure 6E). These involve the carbonyl and amino
groups of Ala1 binding to the matching backbone groups of C360 in
LSD1, the α-amide of Arg2 with the E379 carboxylate group, the
carbonyl group of Met4 to the side chain of N535, and the carbonyl
groups of both Glu6 and Ala7 with the side chain of H564. Most importantly,
the amide forming the lactam of 31 is flanked by two
polar residues, Q358 and N535, with the side chain of the latter being
hydrogen-bonded to the lactam NH. This hydrogen bond may explain why
LSD1 binds somewhat better to macrocycle 31 than to 32, in which the amide bond geometry is reversed. The main
chain carbonyl group of Q358 is also within the hydrogen bonding distance
to this ring-forming amide group, but an unfavorable angle between
the respective groups prevents its formation. The aliphatic parts
of the macrocycle ring, that is, the methylene groups of the side
chains of the lactamized D-Lys3 and Glu6, are docked against a relatively
hydrophobic patch of the LSD1 active site formed by L693 and L677.
Further hydrophobic interactions are found between Ala1 and L362 and
Gln5 with F382 and L536, respectively.

The SAR differences between
the linear and macrocyclic series of
peptides discussed herein are well-rationalized by the different binding
modes of linear peptide 1 and macrocyclic peptide 31 in their complexes with LSD1-CoREST1. Specifically, the
side chains of Arg2 and Arg7 of linear peptide 1 are
both located in cationic pockets, which explains why replacement of
either of them with citrulline results in a diminished recognition
by LSD1. For macrocycle 31, the side chains of both arginine
residues are solvent-exposed, allowing their replacement with citrulline.
Replacement of Ala1 in linear 1 with Pro strengthens
the interaction with LSD1 >10-fold but leads to a lower improvement
(3-fold) or a reduced binding to LSD1 in the macrocycle series. This
difference can be understood by that the binding pocket for Ala1 of
macrocycle 31 is considerably narrower and more polar
than the LSD1 pocket occupied by Ala1 of linear 1. Finally,
NMR spectroscopy revealed that macrocycle 28 mainly adopts
random coil structures in aqueous solution but that it appears to
form a turn which involves Gln5. Such a turn at Gln5 is also found
in the LSD1-bound conformation of 31. This suggests that
the macrocyclization restricts the solution ensemble of 31 to conformations that include the one in the crystalline complex
with LSD1.

The crystal structure of the ternary complex of LSD1-CoREST1
with
the macrocyclic peptide 31, and SAR for a few analogues,
provides some guidance for future optimization of 31 into
a more druglike inhibitor of LSD1. The lack of the electron density
for the C-terminal residues 8–11 of 31 suggests
that it could be possible to remove these residues, thereby reducing
the molecular weight to a range (<1000 Da) allowing cell permeability
and oral absorption.43 The finding that
the charged Arg2 and Arg8 can be replaced by the neutral citrulline
suggests a first step toward reduction of the polarity of 31, which will also be essential for a successful transformation of 31 into an oral drug candidate. Further improvement of the
potency of 31 can be envisioned by compounds reaching
deeper into the active site of LSD1. Inspection of the crystal structure
indicates that this could be achieved by the replacement of the C-terminus
and/or Gln5 of 31 with suitable substituents or by structural
alterations of the lactam bridge.

Conclusions
SPR
biosensor analysis of a series of truncated peptides derived
from the N-terminus of histone H3 revealed that H31-11 K4M (4), a Lys4 to Met-substituted 11-mer peptide,
was the shortest motif that displayed a clear, albeit complex interaction
with LSD1. Macrocyclic derivatives of H31-11 K4M
designed on the basis of H3 peptide-LSD1-CoREST crystal structures
were more potent inhibitors of LSD1 (Ki > 2 μM) but displayed a completely different SAR as compared
to linear 4.

The differences in SAR between the
linear and macrocyclic peptide
inhibitors of LSD1 could be rationalized by determination of the crystal
structure of the complex between LSD1-CoREST1 and one of the lactam-bridged
macrocycles (31). This revealed an intrinsic difference
between the binding poses of cyclized and linear peptides. Macrocyclic
peptide 31 was bound at the outer rim of the histone
tail recognition pocket of LSD1, blocking the entrance into the active
site. In contrast to linear peptides from histone H3, macrocycle 31 did not reach down to the FAD prosthetic group. The structure
of the complex highlighted hydrogen bonding, charge–charge,
and nonpolar interactions that contribute to the regio- and stereoselective
recognition of macrocycles such as 31 by LSD1. The nature
of the macrocyclic bridge was found to be of major importance, both
for the physicochemical properties and the potency of the inhibitors.
The use of a lactam bridge was found to be preferred to a more lipophilic
olefin, that is, a stapled peptide or an aromatic triazole obtained
by click chemistry.

The structure-based approach described in
this work delivered macrocyclic
peptides that inhibited LSD1 substantially better (>40-fold) than
the corresponding linear parent peptide. However, the macrocyclic
inhibitors adopted a completely different binding pose in complex
with LSD1 than that predicted in our design. Only the seven N-terminal
amino acid residues and the lactam bridge of 31 are well-resolved
in the crystal structure with LSD1. This indicates that it could be
possible to develop drug-like inhibitors of LSD1 from 31 that have molecular weights within the outer border (<1000 Da)
recently found to be compatible with cell permeability and oral absorption.43 In such endeavors, the lower molecular weight
constitutes an advantage for 31 as compared to a macrocyclic
21-mer peptide reported earlier.25 The
finding that the charged Arg2 and Arg8 can be replaced by the neutral
citrulline further suggests that macrocycle 31 can be
a useful starting point for the development of inhibitors of LSD1.
The novel binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the complex
of 31 with LSD1 should be of importance for structure-based
efforts to design drugs for treatment of cancers, such as leukemia,
breast, and prostate cancer.

Experimental Section
Structure Preparation
The X-ray crystal structures
of LSD1 co-crystallized with CoREST and bound peptides, that is, H3
pK4PYR (PDB ID: 2UXN, 2.7 Å resolution),34 H3 pM4 (PDB ID: 2V1D, 3.1 Å resolution),24 and SNAIL1
pF4 (PDB ID: 2Y48, 3.0 Å resolution),33 were retrieved
from the Protein Data Bank. The structures of the complexes were imported
into the Maestro module (2015.1), available in the Schrödinger
Suite (Schrödinger, LLC)44 and optimized
by using the Protein Preparation Wizard.45 This optimization included adding hydrogen atoms, assigning bond
orders, and building disulfide bonds. The protonation states of the
ionizable residues (at pH = 7) were predicted by the PROPKA tool46 provided in the Protein Preparation Wizard.
An optimized structure was finally found by energy minimization (i.e.
the position of the hydrogen atoms) with the OPLS_2005 force field.
The “Superposition” tool from the Maestro module was
used for protein sequence comparison and design of peptide inhibitors.

Conformational Sampling of Alkyl Chain-Bridged Macrocyclic Peptides
Alkane and alkene-bridged macrocyclic peptides were built based
on the sequence of peptide 6 (ARTMQTA). Templates for
cyclization between A1 and T3, and T3 and T6, were obtained by orienting 6 in the secondary structure adopted by the bound peptide
in structures 2V1D and 2UXN,
respectively. Alkane series with bridges ranging from three to four,
and five to nine, carbon atoms were built using the Molecular Operating
Environment (MOE version 2015.10) builder for the A1–T3 and
T3–T6 cyclic peptides, respectively. Alkene series had bridges
ranging from three to four, and five to 11, carbon atoms for the A1–T3
and T3–T6 cyclic peptides, respectively, with the alkene located
in the middle of the bridge. For the T3–T6 cyclic peptides,
only alkenes with an odd number of carbon atoms could be built with
an acceptable fit of the bridge to the peptide backbone. These bridge
lengths were chosen to provide a range of distances between the A1
and T3, and T3 and T6, α-carbon atoms that included those found
in structures 2V1D and 2UXN (5.1
and 7.4 Å, respectively). Both series of structures were minimized
using the MMFF94x force field with the following settings: rmsd ≤
0.5 Å, Generalized Born solvation model (ε = 80). Explicit
hydrogen atoms were added, formal and partial charges were assigned,
and a second minimization cycle with the above settings was performed.
Conformational sampling was performed using the MOE-LowModeMD algorithm47 with the following settings: iteration limit:
10 000, rejection limit: 5000, RMS gradient: 0.005, MM iteration
limit: 500, energy window: 7 kcal mol–1, and conformation
limit: 10 000. The resulting conformational ensembles were
superimposed on the original secondary structures of peptide 6 by using the backbone as a query. The score assigned to
each conformer indicates the similarity to the secondary structure
of 6 and Boltzmann weighting of the scores for each macrocyclic
peptide guided the choice of the appropriate bridge lengths used for
synthesis of the cyclized peptides.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Linear Peptides
Appropriately protected amino
acids and reagents for peptide synthesis
were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification
unless noted. The peptides were synthesized on a peptide synthesizer
(Prelude, Protein Technologies Inc.) using standard Fmoc chemistry
with HCTU and N,N-diisopropylethyl
amine (DIPEA) as activating reagents. Fmoc deprotection of the α-amino
group was performed using 20% piperidine in NMP. The synthesis was
performed on a 50 μmol scale using a Rink amide resin (0.18
mmol/g, 4-((2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)(Fmocamino)methyl)phenoxymethylpolystyrene
resin, ChemPep Inc.) or a Wang resin (0.45 mmol/g, 4-benzyloxybenzyl
ester polystyrene resin crosslinked with 1% divinylbenzene, Sigma
Aldrich) preloaded with the desired C-terminal amino acid. Standard
amino acids (250 μmol, 5 equiv), HCTU (0.55 mL of 0.45 M solution
in DMF, 250 μmol, 5 equiv) and DIPEA (0.25 mL of a 2 M solution
in NMP, 500 μmol, 10 equiv) were sequentially added to the resin
and coupling was allowed to proceed for 20 min, then repeated once.
Coupling of nonstandard amino acids, suitable for macrocyclization
via olefin metathesis, lactamization, or click chemistry (cf. procedures
below), was performed only once with two equivalents of amino acid
but for 40 min. The side chains of standard amino acids (ChemPep)
were protected with tert-butyl (Ser, Thr), trityl
(Gln), 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Arg), and tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Lys) groups, respectively. When all
amino acids had been incorporated in the peptides not intended for
macrocyclization, the N-terminal Fmoc group was deprotected, and the
peptide was cleaved from the resin by treatment with a mixture of
TFA, triethylsilane, water, 1,2-ethanedithiol, and thioanisole (93:1:2.5:2.5:1,
5 mL) for 1 h. After removal of the resin by filtration and concentration
of the solution by a flow of N2, the crude peptide was
precipitated by addition of cold ether, filtered, dissolved in water,
and lyophilized overnight. The crude peptide was purified by reversed-phase
HPLC (Varian Prostar, semipreparative column: pore size 100 Å,
particle size 10 μm, dimensions 250 × 21.2 mm) using a
gradient of 5 → 40% acetonitrile in water, each containing
0.1% TFA, and then lyophilized. The peptide was characterized by matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
MS) (positive mode), with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as
the matrix (Table 5).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Stapled
Macrocyclic Peptides
All amino acids were coupled to a Rink
amide resin (0.19 mmol/g)
as described in the above “General Procedure for the Synthesis
of Linear Peptides”. The Fmoc group was retained at the N-terminus
of the peptide-resin which was washed sequentially with methanol (3
times) and DCM (3 times) and then dried under vacuum. A portion of
the resin (30 mg) was loaded in a microwave tube (0.5–2 mL)
together with a magnet; then the resin was allowed to swell in 1,2-dichlorobenzene
(DCB, 0.5 mL) for 30 min. Hoveyda–Grubbs Catalyst (1 mg, 2nd
generation) in DCB (0.5 mL) was added; the tube was sealed and placed
in a microwave synthesizer (Biotage Initiator+) where it
was stirred (30 min) and then heated at 200 °C (5 min). After
reaction, the resin was washed with DCM (3 times), treated with 20%
of piperidine in NMP for 40 min to remove the N-terminal Fmoc group,
and then was washed with NMP (3 times) and DCM (3 times). The macrocyclic
peptide was cleaved from the resin, as described in the above “General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Linear Peptides”; the crude
product was purified by reversed-phase HPLC and characterized by MALDI-TOF
MS (Table 5).

General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Lactamized Macrocyclic
Peptides
All amino acids were coupled to a Rink amide resin
(0.19 mmol/g) as described in the above “General Procedure
for the Synthesis of Linear Peptides”. However, the N-terminal
amino acid carried an Nα-Boc-protective
group while the side-chains of Glu and Lys, that were to be involved
in the macrocyclization, were protected with allyl and alloc groups,
respectively. After assembly of the peptide-resin, it was washed with
NMP and DCM (3 times each) and then dried under vacuum for at least
2 h. To remove the allyl- and alloc-protecting groups, the peptide-resin
(100 mg, appr. 19 μmol) was treated with a solution of (Pd(PPh3)3 (30 mM in 10% acetic acid, 85% CHCl3 and 5% N-methyl morpholine, 10 mL) and agitated
under N2 for 3 h. The resin was filtered, washed consecutively
with 0.5% DIPEA in DMF (3 × 10 mL), 0.5% sodium dithiocarbamate
in DMF (3 × 10 mL), DMF (3 × 10 mL), DCM (3 × 10 mL),
and dried under vacuum until dryness. The peptide resin was then swelled
in DMF (5 mL) for 30 min and filtered, after which DMF (10 mL) was
added followed by DIPEA (13.2 μL, 76 μmol, 4 equiv) and
HCTU (15.6 mg, 38 μmol, 2 equiv). The resin was agitated at
rt for 2 h, then filtered and washed consecutively with DMF (3 ×
10 mL) and DCM (3 × 10 mL), and dried under vacuum. The lactamized
macrocyclic peptide was cleaved from the resin using the procedure
described in the “General Procedure for the Synthesis of Linear
Peptides”; the crude product was purified by reversed-phase
HPLC and characterized by MALDI-TOF MS (Table 5).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Peptides
Macrocyclized
via a Triazole Moiety
All amino acids were coupled to a Rink
amide resin (0.18 mmol/g) as described in the above “General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Linear Peptides”. However, l-5-azidolysine and l-propargylglycine were incorporated
at positions 3 and 6 instead of Thr found in the native peptide. After
solid-phase synthesis of the peptide, and deprotection of the N-terminal
Fmoc group, the peptide was cleaved from the resin (100 mg) using
the procedure described in the “General Procedure for the Synthesis
of Linear Peptides”. After filtration to remove the resin,
the crude peptide was precipitated from the concentrated TFA cleavage
solution with cold diethyl ether and then was dissolved in water and
lyophilized. The crude peptide was purified by reversed-phase HPLC
and lyophilized. CuSO4·5H2O (1.67 mg, 6.6
μmol) and ascorbic acid (1.67 mg, 9.4 μmol) were added
to a solution of a pure peptide (2 mg, 1.5 μmol) in tBuOH/H2O (1:2, 1 mL). The solution was stirred
for 2 h under Ar in the dark, concentrated, and lyophilized. The crude
product was purified by reversed-phase HPLC and characterized by MALDI-TOF
MS (Table 5).

NMR Spectroscopy
Lyophilized peptides were reconstituted
in 500 μL DMSO-d6 or aqueous buffer
(20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.5) to a concentration
ranging between 0.8 and 1 mM. Spectra were acquired at 276 K (only
in aqueous buffer) and 298 K (aqueous buffer and DMSO-d6) on a Bruker AVANCE III NMR spectrometer equipped with
a room temperature triple resonance gradient probe head at a magnetic
field strength corresponding to a proton Larmor frequency of 700 MHz.
All spectra were processed with NMRPipe48 and analyzed using CARA (http://cara.nmr.ch) and NMRView.49 For proton resonance
assignments, 1H-1H correlated homonuclear TOCSY,50 NOESY,51 and ROESY52,53 experiments were recorded. For 13C and 15N
resonance assignments, natural abundance 1H–15N and 1H–13C heteronuclear single
quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments54−56 were recorded. Sequential
assignments were obtained via HN–Hα-1 cross peaks. Resonance assignments for 4, 23, and 28 in DMSO-d6 are
complete and could be unambiguously transferred to resonances at 276
and 298 K in aqueous buffer using the same set of experiments listed
above (Supporting Information). Secondary
structure prediction from secondary chemical shifts at 298 K in DMSO-d6 (Cα and Cβ) was done according to the study of Wishart and Sykes,42 by calculating the deviation of Cα and Cβ from random coil reference values. For the
non-natural amino acids, which are used for cyclization, or of which
side chains are changed upon lactamization, no reference values are
available. Instead, random coil chemical shift index values of lysines,
which have similarly long side chains, were used at positions 3 and
6 for all three peptides. The change of secondary chemical shifts
between the three peptides with respect to the reference random coil
shift index values reports on conformational differences.

LSD1172-833 Expression and Purification
DNA with a nucleotide sequence
corresponding to LSD1 cDNA 514-2499
bp (Genbank a/n NM_015013), flanked with NdeI/XhoI restriction sites
on the 5′ and 3′-ends, was obtained from ThermoFisher
Scientific (Netherlands). The gene was subcloned into a pET15b expression
vector (Merck KGaA, Germany) using the STRU-cloning method.57 The final construct consisted of hexahistidine
tag, followed by a thrombin cleavage site and LSD1 amino acid residues
172–833. The expression construct was used to transform Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 strain (Merck KGaA). A
single colony was inoculated into 4 mL of LB media supplemented with
ampicillin and chloramphenicol to 100 and 35 μg mL–1, respectively, and cultured at 37 °C for 8 h. It was later
expanded to a larger volume of Terrific Broth media with the same
antibiotics and grown at 30 °C until the culture reached OD600 = 0.6. The expression of protein was induced by the addition
of 0.2 mM isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and
the bacteria were cultivated at 18 °C overnight. The cell suspension
was collected by centrifugation at 5000g for 20 min,
resuspended in cold lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole,
2 mM EDTA, 0.25 mg mL–1 lysozyme (Sigma)), and incubated
for 15 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed by sonication (VibraCell
VC600, Sonic&Materials Inc.) applying 6 cycles of 10 s pulses
followed by a 45 s cool down. Alternatively, the cells were lysed
using a French press at 1.7 kbar pressure. The lysate was supplemented
with 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 μg mL–1 of both DNAse I and RNAse I (Roche, Switzerland)
and clarified by ultracentrifugation at 25 000g for 30 min at 4 °C. All the following steps were done at 4
°C, and all chromatographic procedures were performed using the
Äkta Explorer FPLC system (GE Healthcare, Sweden) monitoring
absorption at 260, 280, and 460 nm. The lysate was loaded on an Ni-NTA
Sepharose column (buffer A: 25 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole,
pH 8, buffer B: same as A, but supplemented with imidazole to 250
mM). The column was washed with 10% buffer B for 10 CV, and the IMAC
fraction was eluted with 100% buffer B. The eluate was exchanged on
a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) to AEC buffer A (25
mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), pH
8.0), AEC buffer B—same as A, but supplemented to 1 M with
NaCl. The sample was applied on a HiTrap Sepharose column (GE Healthcare)
and the fraction of interest was eluted with a step salt gradient
at 5% AEC buffer B. Usually, the protein was 99% pure at this stage
(see below), as assessed by SDS PAGE. The protein solution was supplemented
with NaCl to 300 mM and then concentrated using 30 kDa cut-off centrifuge
concentrators at 2000g. Alternatively, pooled AEC
fractions were desalted to AEC buffer A, re-sorbed on Sepharose Q
and eluted with 26% AEC buffer B. The sample was aliquoted and flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen. If the purity was not satisfactory after anion
exchange, minor impurities were removed by separation on a Superdex
S-200 size-exclusion column equilibrated with 25 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl,
2 mM β-ME, pH 8.0.

Protein purity was evaluated by SDS
PAGE. The total protein concentration was estimated using a BCA assay,
and the fraction of FAD-containing protein determined by measuring
the FAD content in denatured (by supplementation with 0.3% SDS) protein
using fluorescence or UV/vis spectroscopy (λex =
450 nm, λem = 520 nm) and a FAD calibration curve.
According to this analysis, >95% of LSD1172-833 contained
the prosthetic group. The average yield of the protein was around
6 mg from 1 L cell culture.

CoREST1308-485 Expression
and Purification
DNA with a nucleotide sequence corresponding
to the codon-definition
site of CoREST1 (GeneBank a/n BC051003.1) was obtained from ThermoFisher
Scientific. The sequence corresponding to amino acids 308–443
was flanked with NdeI/XhoI restriction sites and subcloned into a
pET15b expression plasmid. The final construct consisted of a hexahistidine
tag, followed by a thrombin cleavage site and CoREST1 amino acid residues
308–485. The growth conditions, cell lysis, and IMAC purification
step were similar to those described for LSD1. The purity of the protein
was >85%, and the average yield around 3 mg from 1 L cell culture.

LSD1-CoREST1 Complex Purification
Individually purified
His-tagged LSD1 and His-tagged CoREST1 were combined in 1:2 molar
ratio and buffer exchanged to TBS buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,
pH 8.0) supplemented with 1 mM DTT. Restriction grade human thrombin
(Merck KGaA) was added to the mixture, 0.5 catalytic units per apparent
mg of the protein, and proteolysis was performed overnight at 4 °C.
Subsequently, NaCl and imidazole concentrations were adjusted to 300
and 50 mM, respectively, and the cleavage products were separated
by reverse IMAC. The flow through was concentrated, and the binary
complex was separated from the individual components by size-exclusion
chromatography on Superose 12 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated
with a storage buffer (50 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.5).
The purity of the complex exceeded 95%, the fraction of interest was
concentrated to 24 mg mL–1, aliquoted, and used
in subsequent crystallization experiments.

LSD1172-833 Interaction Kinetic Analysis
SPR experiments were performed
on Biacore 3000, S51, and T200 biosensors,
using CM5 sensor chips. LSD1 was immobilized at 50 μg mL–1 in 10 mM Bis–Tris 25 mM NaCl buffer, pH 7.0,
following a modified amine coupling procedure at 15 °C. The immobilization
was performed in HBS-T running buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05%
Tween-20, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mM DTT. After the surface activation
with EDC/NHS mixture, the protein was injected at a flow rate of 5
μL min–1 aiming for 11 kRU surface density.
Subsequently, instead of injecting ethanolamine, the running buffer
was switched to TBS-T (25 mM Tris, 150 mM HCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 1 mM
DTT, pH 8.0), and the instrument was temperature-equilibrated to 15
°C. The achieved immobilization level of LSD1 was 12 000–15 000
RU, and the apparent protein binding capacity for the H3K4M 21-mer
control peptide was 20–30%.

Interaction analysis with
peptides 27, 28, and 31–34 was performed at 25 °C in TBS-T running buffer without DTT.

LSD1172-833 Activity and Inhibition Assays
The catalytic activity of LSD1 was analyzed using a horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-coupled fluorescence assay optimized for the current
studies. Measurements were performed using a GeminiXPS Spectramax
fluorimeter (λex = 535 nm, λem =
597 nm, with emission cut-off filter at 570 nm and low PTM voltage)
at 25 °C in white F-bottom 96-well microtiter plates (ThermoFisher
Scientific). The standard reaction (defined after an initial exploration
and optimization of the assay) contained substrate and inhibitors
at various concentrations: 20 μM Amplex Red (ThermoFisher Scientific)
fluorogenic HRP substrate, 1 U mL–1 HRP (Sigma,
USA), 25 nM LSD1, 25 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mg mL–1 BSA (Sigma, grade IV) pH 8 buffer, supplemented with 1% DMSO (v/v).

The enzyme activity was analyzed using residues 1–21 of
histone H3, with monomethylated lysine 4 (H3K4me11-21) as the substrate. It was tested in two-and three-fold dilution
series starting from 200 μM. The saturation curve was based
on initial rates, and Km and kcat values were extracted by using nonlinear regression
of the Michaelis–Menten equation. The concentration of the
active enzyme was estimated by active-site titration at a substrate
concentration of 20 μM (∼Km), using 1 μM GSK-LSD1 inhibitor (Sigma) and an enzyme dilution
series from 4 μM. The hydrogen peroxide calibration curve was
obtained by serial dilution of H2O2 standard
(the concentration was determined photometrically by absorption at
240 nm, ε240 = 43.6 M–1 cm–1) in a reaction mix without LSD1.

For inhibition
assays, the substrate concentration was kept constant
at 20 μM, and inhibitors were used in 2-or 3-fold dilution series
from 100 μM. Inhibition data were normalized and reported as
% inhibition using 10 μM of the GSK-LSD1 irreversible inhibitor
and 2% (v/v) DMSO as positive (100%) and negative controls (0%), respectively.
Inhibition curves were analyzed using the two-parametric equation  In the
equation, y is the
percentage of inhibition relatively to 10 μM of the GSK-LSD1
compound and h is the Hill-like slope factor.

Ki values were quantified
from IC50 values using Cheng–Prusoff relationships
for competitive
inhibitors. However, for compounds 1, 11, 24, 28, 31, 33, and 34, the Ki values
and modes of action were evaluated via the analysis of inhibition
kinetics. Briefly, 2-fold concentration series of the substrate starting
from 100 μM were tested in activity assays at various constant
inhibitor concentrations. The data was subjected to nonlinear global
curve analysis using equations for various inhibition types to evaluate
the inhibition modality and Ki values.
Regression data analysis was done using gnuplot and R software.

LSD1-CoREST1 Crystallization and Crystal Soaking
LSD1-CoREST1
was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 295 K. The 2 μL
drops were prepared by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (9–11
mg mL–1 LSD1-CoREST1 in 50 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl,
2 mM DTT, pH 7.5) and reservoir solution. The best crystals were obtained
with the reservoir solution consisting of 100 mM sodium citrate pH
5.5, 1.1 M sodium tartrate. They appeared within 2 days and grew to
maximal dimensions within 1 week. Soaking was performed in a solution
containing 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 1.5 M sodium tartrate, 1
mM of the respective peptide, and 10% glycerol for in situ cryoprotection,
for 5–10 min. The crystals were flash-frozen by plunging into
liquid nitrogen.

Data Collection, Model Building, and Refinement
Data
were collected at the Diamond light source (DLS, Didcot, UK) beamline
I03. They were indexed and integrated on site using FAST DP58−60 and scaled with AIMLESS from the CCP4 software suite.58 The protein structure was solved by molecular
replacement using PHASER61 and a ligand-free
LSD1-CoREST1 complex (PDB ID: 2V1D(24)) as a search
model. Manual model building in COOT62 was
alternated with restrained and TLS refinement in Phenix63 and REFMAC5.64Rfree was monitored with 5% randomly selected
reflections. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 6. Model quality was determined using Rampage.65 Figures containing structural information were
prepared with PyMol.66 Note that the protein
