To improve the hydrophilicity and imparting antibacterial
properties
to poly(lactic acid), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and silver particles
(AgNPs) were simultaneously introduced onto the surface of poly(lactic
acid) (PLA) films by γ-ray irradiation. The morphology and structure
of the modified films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM)/energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry and Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The interaction between PAA and AgNPs
was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), confirming
the coordination between AgNPs and the oxygen atom on the carboxylic
group of PAA. The contact-angle (CA) measurements and antibacterial
tests showed that the modified PLA films with a low silver content
(PLA-g-PAA-Ag) exhibited excellent hydrophilicity
as well as antibacterial activity compared with the neat PLA film.

1 Introduction
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA)
is an environmentally friendly polymer
with promising applications due to its renewability, biodegradability,1 biocompatibility,2 excellent thermomechanical properties,3,4 and good processing
properties.5 It has been applied in the
biomedical field such as in absorbable surgical sutures,6 skeleton materials,7 disposable isolation pads, and drug delivery systems,8−10 as well as clothing fabrics and textiles.11

As a polyester, PLA has poor hydrophilicity and low functionalization
capacity,12 which seriously affect its
application in clothing, medical supplies, and other fields. Various
physical and chemical methods have been applied to improve the hydrophilicity
of PLA. Blending is one of the simplest methods by combining different
components with different properties. The hydrophilic polymers such
as starch,13 citrate plasticizer, and other
hydrophilic substances were blended with PLA,14 and the hydrophilicity as well as mechanical properties of the blends
can be regulated by adjusting the blending ratio. In addition, the
morphologies of fibers’ cross-sections also play an important
role in hydrophilicity. Taking advantages of larger voids and surface
area provided by the profiled cross-section, fibers with hetero-morphologies
exhibit better hydrophilicity and moisture permeability than those
fibers with round-shaped cross-sections.15 What is more, some functional groups can also be introduced onto
PLA fibers by chemical reactions to improve its hydrophilicity.16 Among these methods, the chemical methods of
introducing hydrophilic groups is an efficient way because the PLA
can be modified at the molecular level.17,18 For example,
PLA and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) containing hydrophilic segments
were chemically copolymerized to prepare PLA-b-PEG-b-PLA tri-block copolymers with different PEG contents.19 The water contact angle of the copolymers decreased
from 79.0 to 33.5° with increasing PEG contents. The obtained
block copolymers can potentially be used to prepare controlled drug
release microcapsules. Other reagents with hydrophilic groups, such
as N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) and acrylic acid can also be applied to
improve the hydrophilicity of PLA by ring-opening grafting or melt
condensation with PLA.20,21

Moreover, the antibacterial
activity of PLA is also one of the
foremost considerations in some fields, especially fabrics. Antibacterial
agents, such as nanosilver,22,23 allyl isothiocyanate,24 or chitin,25 were
introduced into PLA. Mao et al.26 prepared
a double antibacterial coating (PPy/Ag) by polymerizing pyrrole (Py)
on the surface of a PLA film. Silver ions (Ag+) were used to initiate
the oxidation of pyrrole and render antibacterial properties to the
obtained coating. The total number of Escherichia coli colonies of the modified PLA film was reduced by more than four
orders of magnitude compared with that of the pure PLA film. Fei et
al.27 synthesized PLA/tea polyphenol nanofibers
with great antibacterial activity. The inhibition rates of nanofibers
on E. coli and S. aureus were 96.9 and 97.6%, respectively.

γ-Ray irradiation
has been widely used in the modification
of PLA due to its simple and controllable reaction conditions, low
energy consumption, and environmental friendliness.28,29 It has been reported that poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) (EVOH)
and PLA blends were modified in the presence of triallyl isocyanurate
(TAIC) by γ-ray irradiation.30 The
heat distortion temperature of the irradiated blends has dramatically
increased from 70 °C (neat PLA) to 140 °C. Chen et al.31 reported that NVP was grafted on PLA under γ-ray
irradiation. The water contact angle of the modified PLA film decreased
with the increase of the grafting yield of poly(vinyl pyrrolidones)
(PVP). When the grafting yield was 41.3 wt %, the contact angle decreased
from 75.1 to 50.3°. Therefore, high-energy irradiation is an
effective way to modify PLA.

In this work, PLA films were endowed
with hydrophilicity and antimicrobial
properties by γ-ray irradiation. A hydrophilic monomer, acrylic
acid (AAc), was modified on the surface of PLA films by the γ-ray-induced
grafting polymerization. The effect of monomer concentration on the
grafting yield and hydrophilicity was systematically studied. The
silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were further loaded on the surface of
PLA by γ-ray-induced reduction to improve the antibacterial
activity of PLA. The antibacterial rate of the grafted film with AgNPs
to E. coli and S. aureus was more than 99%,and the water contact angle decreased from 94.5
(neat PLA film) to 64.1°.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure Analysis of Radiation-modified PLA
2.1.1 Characterization of PLA-g-PAA Films
The effect of the monomer concentration of acrylic
acid on graft yield (GY) is shown in Figure 1A. It is shown that the GY increases with
the increase of monomer concentration. The concentration of the diffused
monomer in the PLLA matrix increases with the increased monomer concentration
in the solution, which is facilitated by AAc grafting. When the monomer
concentration is 4.82 mol L–1, the GY reaches 19.53
wt %. A further increase of the AAc concentration leads to self-polymerization
of the AAc monomer. The homopolymerization of AAc is not beneficial
to monomer diffusion and grafting because of the increased viscosity.32

rate of
50 Gy/min and a total dose of 10 kGy (B) FTIR spectra of PLA, PLA-g-PAA, and PAA (a, PLA; b–e, PLA-g-PAA-1–4; f, PAA).

FTIR spectra of PLA, PLA-g-PAA,
and PAA homopolymer
gels are presented in Figure 1B. A strong band at 1748 cm–1 can be found
in all of the PLA samples, which can be assigned to the C=O
stretching vibration of PLA.33 Since this
group does not change in the reaction, the curves of PLA and PLA-g-PAA were normalized based on this band. For PLA films,
there are two characteristic bonds at 1435 and 748 cm–1, corresponding to the bending vibration and out-of-plane bending
vibration of −CH3,34 and
the band at 1060 cm–1 is attributed to the C–O–C
bond stretching vibration.35 While in the
spectrum of PLA-g-PAA, two new peaks at 1706 and
922 cm–1 appears, corresponding to the C=O
and −OH in the carboxyl group of acrylic acid grafted on the
surface of PLA films.36 These two bands
are enhanced with the increase of GY. These results indicate that
PAA chains are successfully grafted onto the surface of PLA films.

2.1.2 Characterization of PLA-g-PAA-Ag
To explore the effect of AgNO3 concentration
on the amount of AgNPs loaded on the surface of PLA-g-PAA films, PLA-g-PAA-Ag samples prepared at different
AgNO3 concentrations are analyzed by ICP (Figure 2). When the concentration of
AgNO3 is 0.001 mol L–1, the silver content
on the surface of the sample is 1.6 × 101 mg/kg. When
the concentration increases to 0.06 mol L–1, the
silver content of PLA-g-PAA-Ag-4 is up to 8.7 ×
103 mg/kg. The silver loading is positively correlated
with the AgNO3 concentration.

Figure 2 Effect of AgNO3 concentration on the silver content
in the samples.

SEM/EDX analyses were also used to characterize
the morphology
of PLA, PLA-g-PAA-2, and PLA-g-PAA-Ag-4
(Figure 3). It is observed
that the surface of the PLA film is smooth with no wrinkles. For the
PLA-g-PAA-2 film, a small amount of agglomeration
can be observed and the distribution is relatively uniform, which
is attributed to the grafted PAA on the surface of the PLA film. Besides
agglomeration, a small number of bright spots can be seen on the surface
of PLA-g-PAA-Ag-4, corresponding to AgNPs. Figure 3d–f shows
the EDX images of PLA-g-PAA-Ag-4. It can be seen
that AgNPs are evenly distributed on the surface of PLA even with
the highest content. In addition, compared with PLA-g-PAA-2, PLA-g-PAA-Ag-4 shows a more uniform distribution
of PAA. It is speculated that the addition of AgNPs may prevent the
agglomeration of PAA chains.

elemental distribution of PLA-g-PAA-Ag-4.

To uncover the interaction mechanism between PAA and
AgNPs, XPS
is used (Figure 4).
For PLA-g-PAA-Ag-4, strong peaks at 368.1 and 374.1
eV (Figure 4A) are
observed, corresponding to the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 binding energies,
respectively.37 These results also confirm
that Ag is loaded on the surface of PLA-g-PAA-Ag-4.
As shown in Figure 4B, C 1s signals of PLA films can be resolved into three peaks at
284.8, 286.9, and 289.1 eV, which correspond to C–C, C–O,
and C=O functional groups on PLA films, respectively.38 For PLA-g-PAA-2 and PLA-g-PAA-Ag-4,
there are no changes in the C 1s peaks, which implies that carbon
atoms do not directly interact with Ag atoms. The O 1s spectrum of
PLA (Figure 4C) exhibits
two peaks centered at 533.8 and 532.1 eV, which are assigned to the
C=O and C–O groups, respectively. For PLA-g-PAA-2, no obvious changes can be observed in the O 1s spectrum,
which indicates that the grafted PAA on the surface of PLA has little
effect on the chemical environment of the O atom. However, for PLA-g-PAA-Ag-4, a new peak at 531.0 eV appears corresponding
to Ag:O, which suggests the interaction between the oxygen atoms and
Ag atoms (Table 1). Similar results have been reported in
the literature.39 Furthermore, the binding
energy of C=O shifts from 533.8 to 533.4 eV, indicating that
the coordination bonds are formed between Ag and oxygen atoms in carbon–oxygen
double bonds and the electron clouds are migrated. The possible the
interaction between AgNPs and PAA is depicted in Scheme 1.

2.2 Hydrophilicity and Antibacterial Properties
of Radiation-modified PLA Films
The water contact angle is
used to evaluate the surface hydrophilicity of PLA films, as shown
in Figure 5, Tables 2 and 3. As expected, the water contact angle of the PLA-g-PAA film decreases with the increase of GY. For example,
the water contact angle of the pure PLA film was 94.5°, which
decreased to 64.1° with the increase of GY to 19.53%. Compared
with PLA-g-PAA-2, the contact angle of PLA-g-PAA-Ag increased with the increase of AgNP content, which
is due to the poor hydrophilicity of AgNPs on the surface.40 However, the contact angle of PLA-g-PAA-Ag-1 prepared with lower AgNO3 concentration did
not show an obvious increase as compared to PLA-g-PAA-2 with the same monomer concentration.

The antibacterial activities of the PLA films against E. coli and S. aureus were studied on solid growth media, and the results are shown in Table 3. All of the obtained
PLA-g-PAA-Ag films exhibit higher antibacterial activity
than that of the neat PLA film while the PLA-g-PAA-2
film doesn’t show improved antibacterial activity. Meanwhile,
the antibacterial effects of the modified films are increased with
the increase of AgNPs content. When the silver content reaches 1.6
× 101 mg/kg, the antibacterial rate against S. aureus is 84%, and when the content reaches 9.0
× 101 mg/kg, the antibacterial rate of the sample
against the two species of bacteria are both higher than 99%. Furthermore,
the PLA-g-PAA-Ag show higher antibacterial activity
against E. coli than S. aureus, which is due to the antibacterial mechanisms
of AgNPs and the different structure of bacteria. The contact reaction
between AgNPs and cells occurs when AgNPs penetrate the cell wall,
which leads to the destruction or dysfunction of the inherent components
of bacteria and the death of bacteria. AgNPs is more difficult to
penetrate the cell wall of S. aureus composed of a thick layer of peptidoglycan, which result in a lower
antibacterial activity compared to E. coli.22,41

2.3 Thermal Stability of Radiation-modified PLA
Films
The TGA results of PLA, PLA-g-PAA-2,
and PLA-g-PAA-Ag-4 films are shown in Figure 6. The temperature of 5% weight
loss (T5%) and the maximum degradation
temperature (Tmax) of neat PLA films were
332 and 365.3 °C, respectively. While the T5% and Tmax of the PLA-g-PAA-2 film decreased to 313.7 and 354.0 °C (a decrease
of nearly 10 °C), respectively. This is attributed to the poor
thermal stability of PAA. The T5% of PLA-g-PAA-Ag-4 is 312.4 °C, which is similar to that of
the PLA-g-PAA-2 film. However, Tmax is 363.2 °C, which is close to that of the neat
PLA film. It is suggested that the loaded AgNPs can improve the thermal
stability of the PLA matrix of the PLA-g-PAA film.42,43

3 Conclusions
PLA films with improved
hydrophilicity and antimicrobial properties
were prepared by γ-ray radiation-induced simultaneous grafting
polymerization and Ag reduction. The degree of grafting increased
with the increase of AAc monomer concentration. The maximum GY reached
19.53% at 4.82 mol/L AAc concentration, and the water contact angle
of PLA films decreased from 94.5° (neat PLA film) to 64.1°.
The PLA film loaded with AgNPs, which showed hydrophilic and antimicrobial
capabilities, was successfully prepared. The AgNPs were loaded onto
the surface of PLA films via grafted PAA chains, which endowed the
films with excellent hydrophilicity and antibacterial properties.
The antibacterial rate of the grafted film (PLA-g-PAA-Ag-3) to E. coli and S.aureus were more than 99%, while maintaining the
hydrophilicity. This work opens up an environment-friendly approach
to prepare PLA films with excellent antibacterial and hydrophilic
properties.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
PLA (optical purity >
99%, Mn = 47 kg/mol, DPI = 2.61) was supplied
by Zhejiang
Haizheng Biomaterials Co., Ltd. Silver nitrate (AgNO3)
was obtained from Beijing TongGuang Fine Chemicals Company. The acrylic
acid (AAc) monomer was obtained from Tianjin Fuchen Reagent Factory.
Absolute ethanol was purchased from Beijing Chemical Factory. All
reagents and solvents were analytical-grade chemicals and were used
directly without further purification.

4.2 Fabrication of Modified PLA Films
PLA pellets were dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 12 h to remove
the residual H2O in PLA. PLA films were obtained by melt
pressing for 5 min in 190 °C and then cut into small pieces with
a size of 6.5 × 2.5 cm2.

A series of monomer
solutions was prepared by adding acrylic acid with different volumes
into ethanol/water = 8:2 solvent. PLA films and monomer solution were
added into glass tubes, and then the mixture was saturated with nitrogen
for 20 min to remove oxygen. Sealed glass tubes were irradiated using
a 60Co source at the Department of Applied Chemistry of
Peking University at room temperature. The dose was 10 kGy, and the
dose rate was 50 Gy/min. The obtained films were washed three times
and soaked in excessive absolute ethanol for 20 h at room temperature
to remove residual unreacted monomer and homopolymers of polyacrylic
acid (PAA) and then dried in an oven at 60 °C to constant mass.
The resulting films were called PLA-g-PAA in short.

A series of grafting solutions with Ag was prepared by adding AgNO3 with different weights to the solution within AAc (2.41 mol
L–1). The graft films were treated under the same
irradiation and post-treatment conditions. The resulting films were
denoted PLA-g-PAA-Ag.

The abbreviations of
the samples with different monomer concentrations
and AgNO3 concentrations are listed in Table 4.

4.3 Characterization
The grafting yield
(GY) was determined gravimetrically using eq 1 1  where W1 and W0 denote the weights of grafted and original
PLA films, respectively.

FTIR measurements were carried out
using a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer within the wavenumber range
of 500–4000 cm–1. A total of 32 scans/sample
were taken, with a resolution of 4 cm–1. The surface
morphology of PLA films was observed by a SEM (JEOL JSM-7500F, Japan)
and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (OXFORD INCAx-sight).
The sample was coated with platinum before observation. The instrument
was operated at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and 10 μA. The
chemical composition of the surface of PLA films was semiquantitatively
examined by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (Kratos AXIS Supra).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the samples was carried out with
a TGA Q-500 series analyzer (TA Instruments) with a temperature range
of 35–500 °C. The heating rate was 10 K/min with a continuous
flow of nitrogen at 50 mL/min.

To determine the surface properties
of samples, the water contact
angles were measured on an OCA 20 contact-angle system (Dataphysics,
Stuttgart, Germany) at 25 °C. The average contact angle values
were calculated by measuring at least five different positions of
each film. The antibacterial activities of the PLA films against E. coli and S. aureus were evaluated according to the standard procedure (ISO22196-2011).
