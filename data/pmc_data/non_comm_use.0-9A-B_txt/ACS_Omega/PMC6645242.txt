Carbon
nanotube supported ternary metallic nanocatalysts (NCs)
comprising Nicore–Pdshell structure and
Pt atomic scale clusters in shell (namely, Ni@Pd/Pt) are synthesized
by using wet chemical reduction method with reaction time control.
Effects of Pt4+ adsorption time and Pt/Pd composition ratios
on atomic structure with respect to electrochemical performances of
experimental NCs are systematically investigated. By cross-referencing
results of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray
diffraction, X-ray absorption, density functional theoretical calculations,
and electrochemical analysis, we demonstrate that oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) activity is dominated by depth and distribution of
Pt clusters in a Ni@Pd/Pt NC. For the optimum case (Pt4+ adsorption time = 2 h), specific activity of Ni@Pd/Pt is 0.732 mA
cm–2 in ORR. Such a value is 2.8-fold higher as
compared to that of commercial J.M.-Pt/C at 0.85 V (vs reversible
hydrogen electrode). Such improvement is attributed to the protection
of defect sites from oxide reaction in the presence of Pt clusters
in NC surface. When adsorption time is 10 s, Pt clusters tends to
adsorb in the Ni@Pd surface. A substantially increased galvanic replacement
between Pt4+ ion and Pd/Ni metal is found to result in
the formation of Ni@Pd shell with Pt cluster in the interface when
adsorption time is 24 h. Both structures increase the surface defect
density and delocalize charge density around Pt clusters, thereby
suppressing the ORR activity of Ni@Pd/Pt NCs.

1 Introduction
Mitigation
of global pollution level relies on the development
of clean and sustainable energy sources. To meet the growing energy
demands by new applications in modern society, high-efficiency energy-conversion
technologies are urgent issues to be developed. With the consideration
mentioned above, fuel cell is one of the most promising solution among
the existing energy-conversion means. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
on cathodic nanocatalysts (NCs) incurs the highest energy barrier
(∼0.3–0.4 V) among all components and is a pivotal performance-determining
factor in a fuel cell.1−3 Considering performances and durability of the materials,
carbon-supported platinum-based (Pt/C) NCs with high Pt loading are
commonly employed as cathodic catalysts in fuel cells.4 In addition to material cost, scarcity, reactivity, and
severe selectivity are long-standing issues dragging down the reaction
kinetics of Pt catalysts in ORR. Therefore, development of low Pt
loading catalysts is one the most important issues in the fuel cell
device. Intensive researches have been done on less expensive and
more abundant materials in the form of alloys,5−8 core–shell structures,9−11 nitrides,12 nanoframes,13 nanowires,14,15 porous structures,16,17 sandwich structures,18 nanotubes,19 etc. for ORR NCs. However, efficiency and stability
of state-of-the-art advanced cathodic catalysts remain far from the
commercial standards.

Among the existing nanostructure configurations,
Mcore–Ptshell (M stands for transition
metals with high
oxygen affinity, e.g., Ni, Co, Pd) structured NCs with proper heteroatomic
intermix and shell thickness (low Pt loading) are considered the most
efficient design in terms of cost reduction, ORR activity facilitation,
and stability improvement. From heterogeneous catalysis theory, redox
kinetics of NCs are dominated by three fundamental effects including
bifunctional mechanism, ligand effect, and lattice strain. Bifunctional
mechanism arises when dissimilar surface atoms work together to interact
with adsorption species. For adsorption in heteroatom sites, formation
of incoherent bond vibration modes and presence of intermediate species
in local coordination environment generate inequality in chemical
stress at adsorption bonds and thus facilitate redox kinetics of NCs.
Ligand effects are caused by the atomic vicinity of two dissimilar
surface metal atoms. With difference in electronegativity, ligand
effect induces charge transfer between two neighboring atoms and thus
affects the band strength of the adsorbed molecule. Lattice strain
is caused by differences in atomic arrangement between surface atoms
and crystal structure underneath. It can turn compressive or expansive
form in surface layer, therefore, localize (delocalize) electron in
shell crystal to enhance (suppress) the ORR activity of NCs. In core–shell
NCs, an active shell crystal with a compressive strain provides direct
access for oxygen reduction and high oxygen affinity core provides
low-energy pathways for the allocation and recombination of radicals
(i.e., O*, OH*, and H*) into H2O. Both the two manners
reduce the desorption barrier of intermediate species, thereby facilitating
the ORR activity of NCs.

With proper composition and configuration,
core–shell-structured
NC seems a perfect design in ORR application. However, further optimization
on ORR performance is limited due to the lack of room for strain or
ligand effect engineering bound to a critical condition of the core
crystal capping with a monolayer active material (noble metal in most
cases) shell. Such a situation not only hinders the performance improvement
but also the cost and durability of electrocatalysts. To further improve
the utilization and reduce the loading of noble metal, decoration
of active materials in the form of atomic clusters in core–shell
NC surface is a possible strategy.20−24 Due to the electronegative difference and lattice
strain in interfaces, those atomic clusters localize electrons from
neighboring atoms and thus weaken oxygen adsorption in NC surface.
Meanwhile, formation of heterogeneously adjacent nanocomponents with
different redox activity in intermediate steps offers facile pathways
to boost ORR kinetics (activity) of NCs.

Surface oxide on noble
metal inhibits the subsequent adsorption
of oxygen molecules and is a known obstacle in ORR kinetics. In this
work, a facile wet chemical reduction method with reaction time control
is developed for the synthesis of ternary catalysts comprising Ni/NiOx core and Pd shell with atomic Pt cluster decoration
on the surface (namely, Ni@Pd–Pt). The end products show tunable
surface oxophilicity and ORR activity in an alkaline environment (0.1
M KOH). We demonstrated that the ORR activity of experimental NCs
is determined by the atomic rearrangement of Pt clusters in Ni@Pd
crystal. By changing the adsorption time of Pt4+ ions before
the reduction time, the oxophilicity of experimental NCs is controlled
with respect to the Pt atoms diffusion in Pd shell region. A worthy
finding is that the specific surface activity (SA) is 0.732 mA cm–2 (which is 2.8-fold as compared to that of “0.261
mA cm–2” for commercial Pt catalyst) when
the adsorption time for Pt4+ ions in Ni@Pd surface is 2
h. The coverage effect of Pt clusters is revealed by changing Pt loading
in the crystal growth recipe with optimized Pt4+ ion adsorption
time (2 h) in Ni@Pd surface.

2 Results and Discussion
The surface morphologies of as-prepared NCs were analyzed by using
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Figure 1 compares the HRTEM
images of experimental NCs (NPP-10 s, NPP-2 h, and NPP-24 h). The
corresponding inverse Fourier transformed (IFT) images and line histogram
of selected fringes are compared in insets. Variations in NCs shape
are mainly attributed to the factors including differences in surface
free energy, surface oxidation, and heteroatomic intermix in different
facets during crystal growth. As shown in Figure 1a, the NCs are grown nearly in isotropic
spheres with preferential orientation in (111) facet (d(111) 2.25 Å) in NPP-10 s. Truncated surface reveals
the presence of terrace defects (denoted by yellow arrow) by heterogeneous
nucleation and crystal growth in the presence of moderate lattice
mismatch upon accommodation of Pt atoms in the topmost layer to form
a multifaceted twin NC. Such a hypothesis is consistently revealed
by the random displacement of interatomic distances in the NC surface
(R1, R2, and R3 shown in line histogram). Hereby, with a short period
of Pt4+ adsorption time (10 s), the majority of Pt atoms
is posited in the surface defect sites of the Pd shell. Low-magnification
image in Figure 1d
and histogram show that NPP-10 s is grown in a broad size distribution
ranging from 2 to 7 nm with an average particle size of 3.93 nm. Agglomeration
of NC is attributed to the absence of stabilizers upon crystal growth.
For NPP-2 h (Figure 1b), the average particle size is 4.7 nm. As compared to that of NPP-10
s, the surface defect is reduced (denoted by yellow arrows), as is
consistently observed in the local structure regime in the X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) analysis (in later section). Again, such a structure
results from the galvanic replacement between Pt4+ ions
and Pd in the crystal growth stage. In this event, substantial surface
restructuring appears through strong homoatomic clustering between
the Pt atoms and the resulting atomic scaled Pt cluster in the Pd
shell region. Severe galvanic replacement between Pt4+ and
Pd shell with atomic structure rearrangement is evidenced by the formation
of a well crystal shell (denoted by yellow arrows) accompanied by
slightly disordered core region (denoted by red arrow). Intercalation
of Pt clusters in the shell region reduces the surface free energy
and extended adsorption time consumes the residual Pt4+ ion in the reaction system before the addition of the reducing agent.
Both phenomena reduce atomic diffusion in the heterogeneous interface
(solid “NC”–liquid “solution” interface
and solid NC–solid NC interface), leading to less agglomeration
between the contacted NCs in the carbon nanotube (CNT) surface (Figure 1e). Formation of
Pt clusters “inside” the Pd shell with reduced structure
complexity is also revealed by line histogram of particle size (Figure 1e) and lattice constant
(R1, R2, and R3 shown in line histogram). Further increasing the Pt4+ adsorption time to 24 h (Figure 1c) increases the d(111) of NPP-24 h to 2.282 Å (Figure 1c). As compared to that of NPP-2 h, even a narrowed
particle size distribution and a reduced average particle size (4.54
nm) are found (see the low-magnification image in Figure 1f) in NPP-24 h. Both characteristics
can be explained by the formation of the Pt cluster in the near-core
region. Re-deposition of Pd and Ni atoms increases the heteroatomic
intermix, therefore, reduces surface energy of the shell crystal.
In this event, as compared to that of monometallic Pt nanoparticle,
this size of experimental NCs can be stabilized in a smaller size
ranging from 3 to 7 nm (Figure 1f). The HRTEM images with Fourier transform patterns provide
certain proofs for the determination of the atomic structure of the
experimental NiPdPt nanoparticles for density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. Shown in Figure 1a, symmetrically aligned arc patterns of a–a* and b–b*
pairs (red dashed double arrows) suggest the preferential arrangement
of atoms in the (111) facet in NPP-10 s. The presence of bright spots
c–c* pair with a longer radius (Rc–o) than Ra–o (Rb–o) indicates an ordered atomic structure in the
(200) facet. The coexistence of two fast Fourier transform (FFT) symmetric
spots with intensity difference implies a slight atomic restructuring
due to insufficient reaction time for galvanic replacement between
Pt4+ and Ni/Pd atoms in NPP-10 s. In the case of NPP-2
h, the presence of symmetrical FFT patterns (a–a* and b–b*)
with an intersect angle of 90° across the center axis o indicate
the preferential atomic arrangement at the (111) facet. By increasing
the Pt4+ ion adsorption time to 24 h, the presence of a
ring pattern indicates the formation of a polydispersed atomic arrangement
and a locally disordered structure in a NPP-24 h. These structural
differences show a consistent result to that expected by experimental
design and X-ray absorption analysis in this study. The FFT patterns
of the selected regions for NPP-10 s, NPP-2 h, and NPP-24 h NCs have
been depicted in Figure S1 with a detailed
description. High- and low-magnification images of Ni@Pd/Pt NCs for
changing Pt/Pd ratio (NPP-0.1 and NPP-0.2) with a Pt4+ adsorption
time of 2 h are given in Figure S2 as comprehensive
discussions.

times: (a) 10 s, (b) 2 h, and (c) 24 h. The d-spacing
values (denoted by white lines) of the as-prepared NCs are calculated
by using inverse Fourier transformed (IFT) images and their corresponding
line histograms (insets). Fourier transformation patterns of selected
areas in HRTEM images are shown in an upper row. Low-resolution HRTEM
images and particle size distribution histogram (insets) have been

the (111) and (200) facets of metallic Pt nanocrystals in Pt-CNT (gray
dashed line). For XRD pattern of Pd-CNT, the two peaks (green line)
are slightly shifted to the right, suggesting its relatively smaller
lattice constant as compared to Pt-CNT.

With
the same position of diffraction peaks, experimental NCs are
indexed as metallic face-centered cubic phase and show different extent
of preferential growth in the (111) facet. As compared to patterns
of Pd-CNT and Pt-CNT, a substantially increased diffraction background
at two sides of the diffraction peaks indicates the lower content
of Pd scattering matters combining with the (111) diffraction signal
from the sublayer Ni metal (denoted by fitting curves in the Supporting Information (SI)) in NPP NCs. As compared
to the peak positions of Pt-CNT, an upshift of A and B peaks indicates
the decreasing lattice constant and the increasing Pt–Pd alloy
with increasing Pt4+ adsorption time from 10 s to 2 h.
As compared to the peaks of NPP-2 h, downshift of the (111) peak indicates
that an increased lattice constant possibly attributed to the formation
of Pt-enriched core and Pd–Pt alloy shell in NPP-24 h. Average
coherent length at the (111) facet (D(111)) (D(200) for (200) facet) is 3.95 (2.66)
nm for NPP-10 s, 4.25 (3.65) nm for NPP-2 h, and 4.16 (2.65) nm for
NPP-24 h. By cross-referencing the XRD and HRTEM results, the effects
of Pt4+ adsorption time on the crystal structure configuration
provide certain physical prospects on the ORR activity of NPP NCs.
At a low Pt4+ adsorption time (NPP-10 s), high defect density
appears by positing Pt atoms in the NC surface. As denoted by truncated
surfaces, those Pt atoms would form a slight intermix and lattice
strain (XRD) and thus result in semicoherent interfaces (twin boundaries)
in the interfaceted edges of NC. By increasing the Pt4+ adsorption time to 2 h, Pt clusters are mostly intercalated in the
NC surface and generated a largest local compressive strain in the
Pd shell crystal. In diffraction pattern of NPP-2 h, the highest ratio
(3.42) of peak intensity for the (111) and (200) facets indicates
its largest extent of preferential growth in the (111) facet among
the experimental NCs. Increasing Pt4+ adsorption time (i.e.,
24 h) leads to the formation of the high extent of residual Pdn+ ions in the intermediate steps and thus
end up with the formation of a Pt-rich core capped with a Ni/Pd/Pt
shell structure. In such a structure, the local strain is relaxed
and the surface active sites is reduced in NPP-24 h. For comparison
analysis, NPP NCs with Pt/Pd ratios of 0.1 and 0.2 and identical adsorption
times (10 s, 2 h, and 24 h) are synthesized. Details of the structural
interpretation of the NCs by the XRD mentioned above are given in
the Supporting Information (SI) and the XRD patterns (Figure S3), and the calculated structural parameters
are summarized in Table S3.

X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis complementarily proves the effects of Pt4+ ion adsorption time on the NPP NCs structures in atomic and electronic
regimes. Figure 3 compares
the normalized Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectra
(XANES) and Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) spectra of the experimental NCs. In L3-edge spectrum,
the position of the inflection point (arrow X) refers to the threshold
energy (E0) for 2p-to-5d electron transition
and is linearly proportional to the oxidation state of the target
atom (particularly for transition metals). Intensity (HA) and width (WA) of the near-edge
absorption peak (white line) elucidate the relative extent of empty
states and splitting of 5d5/2 orbital. Width (WB) and intensity (HB) of oscillation
hump in the postedge region explain the extent of structure ordering
around the target atom. As shown, an identical position of an inflection
point in XANES region suggests that all the NCs possess a similar
metallic characteristic. For XANES of NPP-10 s, the highest HA indicates the largest extent of oxygen adsorption
in the Pt atom among the presented NCs, again rationalizing the positioning
of the Pt clusters in the NC surface as proposed by HRTEM. For NPP-2
h, the lowest white line intensity (HA) among experimental NCs reveals an inhibition of Pt oxidation and
an offset of X (inset of Figure 3a) to the low-energy side reveals a charge relocation
to Pt from neighboring atoms. Both characteristics rationalize the
steric effects by intercalation of Pt clusters in Pd shell and are
consistently explained by results of quantitative structure analysis
by EXAFS fitting (Table 2). Such an intercalation results in a local disorder structure, as
revealed by a significantly suppressed backscattering intensity in
the postedge region (HB) and the formation
of disordered core region, as shown by HRTEM (Figure 1b). For NPP-24 h, shown by an increased postedge
hump, the atomic structure of NC is rearranged into the ordering phase
due to sufficient galvanic replacement time and subsequent redeposition
of the PdPtNi structure in the shell region by a reduction agent.

a χ stands for the extent of
heteroatomic intermix for M atoms around Pt in a bond pair of Pt–M
(i.e., χ for Pt–Pd refers to the extent of Pd atoms among
the total coordination numbers around Pt atom. For optimization of
structure parameters, σ2 is determined to be 0.004
Å2 by fitting the spectrum of Pt foil and is adopted
for fitting all experimental spectra.

Figure 3b compares
the Fourier transform Pt L3-edge EXAFS spectra (i.e., radial
structure functions, RSFs) of the experimental NPP NCs and Pt-CNT.
Radial peaks (A) across 1.7–3.2 Å account for X-ray interference
with metallic Pt–Pt bond in Pt-CNT. Quantitative structure
parameters are obtained by fitting (Figure S4) the corresponding spectra with proper atomic models, and the results
are summarized in Table 2. Compared to that of Pt-CNT, the offset of peak A position indicates
a reduction of interatomic bond length by ∼0.2 Å around
Pt atoms in all NPP NCs. Compared to that of NPP-10 s and NPP-24 h,
a substantial increment in peak B intensity refers to the largest
extent of in-phase outgoing X-ray interferences between Pt–Pt
bond pairs (i.e., the highest coordination number of Pt–Pt
bond pairs) for NPP-2 h. Quantitative structural analysis exposes
the same results, indicating the largest coordination number of 4.49
at the Pt–Pt shell (CNPt–Pt) for NPP-2 h
among experimental NCs (Table 2). The structure of embedded Pt cluster in Pd shell is consistently
revealed by the presence of the ordered lattice domains in the HRTEM
image (Figure 1b).
For NCs prepared by a Pt4+ adsorption time longer than
2 h, trend on formation of homoatomic cluster is revealed by offset
of RSF peak closing to that of metallic bond pair (peak A). Meanwhile,
decreases in the peak intensity corresponding to a CNPt–Pt
of 3.65 also explains the increasing heteroatomic intermix around
Pt atoms in Pd shell. To further prove our findings, NPPs with Pt/Pd
ratios of 0.1 and 0.2 were prepared and found to have similar structural
characteristics (Figure S5), and the corresponding
electrochemical properties are given in the Supporting Information (ESI).

To get an insight into the approximate
chemical composition of
the uppermost layers (1–2 nm from surface) and the binding
energy of experimental NCs, we performed X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis for the photoelectrons of Pt 4f and Pd 3d levels. Figure S6 shows the typical fitted XPS spectra
in the Pt 4f and Pd 3d region for the experimental NCs. In a Pt 4f
spectrum, doublet peaks about 71 and 74 eV, respectively, refer to
photoelectron emission from Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 orbitals. However, for Pd 3d spectrum, doublet peaks around 336
and 341 eV are responses to photoelectron emission from Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 orbitals, respectively. The peaks
are further deconvoluted to separate the signals from different oxidation
states, and the corresponding results are listed in Table 3.

Through the analysis of the XPS patterns of experimental
NCs, it
can be found that the electronic structure of the ternary NCs strongly
depends on the Pt4+ reduction time on the Ni@Pd surface.
The intensity of emission peaks in the XPS spectrum is positively
related to the electron density of the target atoms. A higher intensity
refers to a higher electron density. Surface chemical composition
and binding energy reveal a nanostructure and trends of electron relocation
between atomic Pt clusters and shell crystal, respectively. Therefore,
the highest intensity found in the XPS spectra of NPP-10 s is attributed
to the most abundant 4f electrons of the Pt atoms. We also observe
that the intensity gradually decreases with increasing Pt4+ reduction time series, which indicates the lower density of the
4f electrons. This is consistent with our XRD, HRTEM, and XAS findings.
According to Table 3, the binding energy of the Pt decreases significantly for NPP-2
h and NPP-24 h. The difference in the binding energy of Pt is due
to electron relocation from the neighboring atoms to the Pt clusters,
which itself is a result of electronegativity gap and lattice expansion
in Pt crystals. An evidence of electron relocation is presented in
the Pd XPS spectrum, which exhibits a lower intensity and thus an
increasing 4d electron vacancy as the Pt4+ reduction time
increases.

To elucidate ORR performances of experimental NCs,
electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and linear
sweep voltammetry (LSV) analyses are employed. Figure 4 compares the Nyquist plots of the NPP NCs
prepared by varying Pt4+ adsorption times (Figure 4a) and Pt/Pd ratios (Figure 4b). The corresponding
electrochemical parameters are determined by matching the features
of EIS spectra with an equivalent electrical circuit containing appropriate
elements using EC-Lab V10.40 software (shown in Figure S7). The Nyquist plot of all the experimental NCs shows
a Warburg-type straight line in the low-frequency region and two overlapping
semicircles in the high-frequency region and medium-frequency region.
In an EIS spectrum, intercept at the Z′real axis is attributed to the internal resistance arising
from the electrolyte (i.e., series resistance (RS) of the electrolyte). The diameter of the high-frequency
semicircle resembles the ion diffusion resistance of the electrolyte
(RSEI), and the semicircle in the medium-frequency
region is responsible for the charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the bulk surface of active material.
The Warburg-type straight line in the low-frequency region represents
the diffusion of ions into the electrode related to Warburg impedance
(i.e., the ion intercalation kinetics in the channels of the active
material).25 According to Figure 4a and Table S4, all the NCs possess RS at the same
level (21.56 Ω for NPP-10 s, 18.93 Ω for NPP-2 h, and
19.83 Ω for NPP-24 h) in bulk electrolyte transportation resistance
between working and reference electrodes. Such a characteristic is
an index which proving that all experimental spectra are measured
without artificial error. An even closer look reveals that NPP-2 h
shows the lowest series resistance (18.93 Ω) among experimental
NCs, which results in lower electrolyte resistance for NPP-2 h and
fast surface kinetics. The lowest RSEI value of NPP-2 h (RSEI is 177.8 Ω
for NPP-2 h, 192.7 Ω for NPP-10 s, and 190.8 Ω for NPP-24
h) suggests its highest ion diffusion kinetics among experimental
NCs. Meanwhile, charge transfer resistance (RCT) of NCs under inspection follows the trend of NPP-2 h (572.1
Ω) < NPP-24 h (617.8 Ω) < NPP-10 s (775.1 Ω),
which consistently proves the highest surface reaction kinetics (i.e.,
SA) of NPP-2 h among all NCs. Comprehensive results are illustrated
by its highest exchange current density (J) which
is inversely proportional to this RCT by
the equation 1  where R, T, n,
and F are the universal constant,
absolute temperature, number of electrons involved, and Faraday’s
constant, respectively. The lowest RCT value leads to the highest exchange current density; therefore (with
the improved ion diffusion at the solid–liquid interface),
the highest electrochemical performance of NPP-2 h is achieved among
experimental NCs. Straight lines in the low-frequency region of the
Nyquist plot are mainly attributed to the diffusion behavior of the
ions. A steep slope of the straight line for NPP-2 h (line “a”)
indicates a relative faster ion diffusion in the solutions in comparison
to others. These are archetypal indications of kinetics controls on
the electrochemical properties and consistently reveal the highest
SA of NPP-2 h in ORR. To get further insight into the proposed statements,
EIS characterizations are conducted on NPP NCs with Pt/Pd ratios of
5% (NPP-2 h-5), 9% (NPP-2 h-9), and 14% (NPP-2 h-14) (Figure 4b). Among all the samples,
NPP-2 h-14 shows the lowest RS and RSEI values (Table S5), along with a steep slope of Warburg-type straight line, indicating
its highest ORR activity.

h, and NPP-24 h and (b) comparative EIS plots of NPP NCs with variable
Pt loading and a Pt4+ adsorption time of 2 h.

In heterogeneous catalysts, dissociation of chemisorbed
oxygen
plays a major role in the ORR steps. In these steps, the oxygen adsorption
strength could determine the activity of NCs. A reduction in the oxygen
adsorption energy (corresponding to Oa peaks) reduces the
applied energy for initiating ORR at the reaction sites, which increases
the stability of the NCs in the redox reactions. By cross-referencing
the results of HRTEM, XRD, and XAS analysis, we notice that different
configurations of atomic Pt clusters in experimental NCs change with
increase in Pt4+ adsorption time. These characteristics
are consistently elucidated by electrochemical analysis. Cyclic voltammetry
(CV) analysis is used to get information of the surface chemical composition
and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of NCs under investigation.
In a CV curve, three distinctive potential regions are found, including
underpotential deposition of hydrogen (UPD-H) region between 0 < E < 0.4 V, the double-layer region between, and the chemisorption
of oxygen species over 0.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode
(RHE) because of hydrogen adsorption/desorption, OH– ligand chemisorption, and reduction of chemisorbed oxygen (forward
scan), as well as reduction of Pt or Pd oxides (backward scan) respectively.
Through integration and double-layer correction, Coulombic charge
(0.405 mC cm–2) is acquired for the reduction of
Pt or Pd oxides and then converted into ECSA. These characteristics
clearly appear in the electrochemical responses of the standard samples
of commercial J.M.-Pt/C EC and control samples (Pt-CNT and Pd-CNT)
in Figure 5a. For J.M.-Pt/C,
position of two characteristic peaks (a* and e*) in the forward scan
denotes the potential to be applied for the dissociation of H+ from close packed (111) and opened (200) facets and corresponding
current, respectively. However, peaks “a” and “e”,
respectively, refer to the current responses of H+ adsorption
in the (111) and (200) facets. Compared to the CV profile of J.M.-Pt/C,
upshift of peaks b* and d* in the forward scan and downshift of peaks
b and d in the backward scan refers to increased energy barrier for
redox desorption/adsorption of H+ in Pt-CNT. As consistently
revealed by XRD observation, a substantially higher intensity of peak
b* than that of peak d* (i.e., weakened H+ interaction
on (200) facets) reveals a preferential crystal growth at (111) facets
in Pt-CNT. At the same time, a higher potential of oxygen adsorption
peak Ob as compared to Oa indicating a lower
oxygen affinity of Pt-CNT as compared to J.M.-Pt. The CV profile of
Pd-CNT is compared as a reference.

Figure 5 Comparative CV curves of experimental
control samples (Pt-CNT,
Pd-CNT, and Ni-CNT) with (a) commercial J.M.-Pt/C, (b) Ni@Pd, (c)
Ni@Pd compared with NPP-0.3 with varies Pt4+ adsorption
time, and (d) Ni@Pd with NPP NCs with different Pt/Pd ratios and Pt4+ adsorption time of 2 h. The CV curves are recorded in N2-purged 0.1 M KOH (pH = 13) electrolyte solution at room temperature,
with an applied potential of 20 mV s–1.

In the UPD-H region, the broad CV peak in backward
sweep of CV
curve can be attributed to the strong affinity of H+ adsorption
in Pd-CNT. Meanwhile, a profound and narrowed Oc peak shows
a strong affinity with simple pathways for oxygen adsorption in the
Pd surface. The CV curve of the control sample (Ni-CNT) is compared
in Figure 5a. As shown,
a “flat” CV sweeping curve indicates the formation of
chemical inert Ni oxides in the ORR in KOH electrolyte. These characteristics
prove that differences of the CV profiles of Pd-CNT could be attributed
to the presence of Ni–Pd interfaces and bimetallic intermix
in the Ni@Pd NC surface. Compared to the CV curves of the control
samples, a downshift of peak “Ha*” and an
upshift of peak “Ha” in the UPD-H region
are observed in the CV curve of Ni@Pd. Such a peak offset refers to
a decrease in the energy barrier for redox desorption/adsorption of
H+. Similar to the CV profiles of Pd-CNT, a smeared H+ desorption peak (Ha*) reveals a strong H+ affinity in the Pd crystal and the Ni/NiOx domain underneath. It is also the same reason that the Oa peak is shifted to left-hand side, indicating a stronger affinity
for oxygen in Ni@Pd as compared to Pt-CNT. Compared to the CV curves
of Pd-CNT and Pt-CNT, a downshift of the O reduction peak (Oa) by 0.03 V indicates a higher energy barrier for oxygen desorption
and a higher double-layer thickness (ΔHd) refers to a higher extent of hydroxide formation in the
Ni@Pd surface as compared to that in Pd-CNT and Pt-CNT. Figure 5c compares the CV curves of
Ni@Pd and the experimental NPP NCs. As consistently revealed by the
lowest HA in the XANES spectrum, the NPP
NCs possess a lower oxidation affinity as denoted by their less intense
oxide formation peaks (i.e., Oa*, Ob*, and Oc*) and oxygen reduction peak (Oa) as compared to
control NCs. Those features further indicate the suppression of oxidation
by Pt cluster intercalation in the Ni@Pd surface. For NPP-2 h, the
lowest oxidation state and the highest ΔHd complementary reveal different reaction rates of reaction
sites around the Pt clusters toward intermediate steps in the ORR.
Such a phenomenon shares redox reaction steps between sites and thus
facilitates the activity of Pt-decorated Ni@Pd NCs. For a comprehensive
comparison, the CV curves of Ni@Pd/Pt NCs containing different Pt/Pd
ratios and Pt4+ adsorption times are shown in Figure 5d, and the corresponding
electrochemical performances are discussed in Figure 6b.

experimental NCs (Ni-CNT,
Ni@Pd, NPP-10 s, NPP-2 h, and NPP-24 h) compared with those of commercial

The LSV curves are measured in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH
solution (pH = 13) with rotation speeds of the working electrode fixed
at 400–3600 rpm (only the spectra measured at 1600 rpm are
shown in (a)).

Figure 6a compares
the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of Ni-CNT, Ni@Pd, J.M.-Pt/C,
and NPP NCs. Slopes of their linear fits at half current potential
(normally at inflection point) are adopted to the Koutecky–Levich
(K–L) equation (eqs 2 and 3) to calculate the number of electrons
transferred in the ORR (Figure S8b), and
the electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 4 2   3  where J is the measured current
density, JK and JL are the kinetic and diffusion-limiting current densities,
respectively, ω is the angular velocity, n is
transferred electron number, F is the Faraday constant, Co is the bulk concentration of O2, v is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte,
and K is the electron-transfer rate constant.

In potential
ranges of 0.95 to 0.8 V (vs RHE), ORR current is controlled
by kinetics of mainly reduction reaction and partially mass diffusion.
By reducing potential below 0.8 V (vs RHE), ORR current is dominated
by mass diffusion kinetics. According to Table 4, the onset potential (Voc) of the experimental NCs follows the order Ni@Pd (0.881
V) < NPP-10 s (0.893 V) < NPP-2 h (0.898 V) < NPP-24 h (0.903
V) < J.M.-Pt/C (0.910 V). In a LSV curve, Voc refers to the threshold voltage for initiating ORR and is
affected by trade-offs between the extent of surface oxidation (steric
shielding effect), heteroatomic intermix (bifunctional mechanism),
and configurational identity of heterogeneous clusters in NC. Surface
oxide puts a negative impact on the ORR activity of NCs. It inhibits
oxygen chemisorption and increase structural complexity around active
sites (noble metal) to increases both internal resistance and steric
diffusion barrier for the surface intermediate species, thereby reducing Voc of the NCs in the ORR. On the other hand,
the presence of heteroatomic intermix provides low-energy pathways
for intermediate steps and facilitates ORR activity. From these stand
points, the highest Voc indicates the
lowest initial barrier for ORR, possibly due to the lower surface
defect of the Pt crystal surface in J.M.-Pt. Specific surface activity
(SA) is an important index for the kinetic performance of active sites
in the NC surface. As can be seen in Table 4, NPP-2 h possesses the highest SA among
experimental NCs. It can be attributed to a proper control of local
structure arrangements including atomic structure intermix and nanostructure
configuration. Consistent structural configurations are proved by
cross-referencing the results of HRTEM, XAS, and XRD. With a configuration
of Pt clusters intercalated in the Pd shell crystal capping at Ni/NiOx core, twin boundaries in the interfaceted edges
are formed and reduce defect sites in the NC surface. In this event,
oxygen chemisorption is suppressed (Figure 3b), facilitating subsequent reaction steps
among Pt and neighboring atoms. Such a statement is consistently revealed
by a less intense oxygen adsorption peak of NPP-2 h in the CV plot.
For the rest of NPP NCs, high contents of defect sites increase oxygen
adsorption in the surface and suppress SA. The electrochemical performances
of NPP with different Pt/Pd ratios (Pt/Pd = 0.1 and 0.2) and identical
Pt4+ adsorption time to the experimental samples (Pt/Pd
= 0.3) are compared (Figure 6b). For a better understanding of the effects of Pt4+ adsorption time on the ORR activity, the electrochemical properties
of Ni@Pd NC without Pt additive are compared, showing a substantial
lower SA (0.142 mA cm–2) as compared to the samples
with Pt decoration. Details of the Ni@Pd/Pt NCs series for variable
Pt/Pd ratio and 2 h Pt4+ → Pt reduction time are
given in the Supporting Information (Figure S8a) and calculated structural parameters are summarized in Table S6. The LSV curves of the experimental
NCs at different rotation speeds from 400 to 3600 rpm have been depicted
in Figure S9.

Facilitation of SA
(reaction kinetics) is not only a matter of
composition (bifunctional mechanism) and composition complexity but
most importantly the configuration-induced charge localization by
Pt intercalation inside Ni@Pd NC. According to our discussions, combining
the results of structural inspections (HRTEM, XRD, and XAS), one can
notice that the size of the Pt cluster and its depth inside the Pd
shell of the NPP NCs are controlled by Pt4+ adsorption
time (i.e., extent of galvanic replacement between Pt4+ ion and Pd/Ni). With Pt4+ adsorption for 10 s, average
CNPt–Pt is determined to be 3.40, suggesting that
Pt atoms are mostly accumulated in the tetragonal bipyramid cluster
(with an average CNPt–Pt of 3.60) located in the
topmost layer of the Pd shell crystal in NPP-10 s. With increasing
Pt4+ adsorption time to 2 h, CNPt–Pt is
increased to 4.49, indicating Pt atoms are assembled in clusters larger
than octahedral (average CNPt–Pt = 4) in NPP-2 h.
Further increasing the Pt4+ adsorption time reduces CNPt–Pt to 3.6 in NPP-24 h. With such a long adsorption
time, a severe galvanic replacement forms discrete Pt clusters in
the Pd/Ni shell and deports substantial amount of Pd ions in the solution.
In this event, subsequent addition of reduction agent simultaneously
posits Pt and Pd atoms to grown Pd–Pt alloy in the shell region.
Those parameters are adopted to atomic models in density functional
theory (DFT) calculations to figure out the configuration effects
on the ORR activity of the experimental NCs in the electronic structure
regime. Figure 7 compares
the DFT-calculated electron structure distribution of the Pt cluster
intercalated 4 × 4 Ni@Pd slab in the (111) facet. In these models,
tetragonal bipyramidal and octahedral Pt clusters with different depth
in the Pd shell are employed to mimick the atomic structure of NPP
NCs. For NPP-10 s, tetragonal bipyramidal Pt clusters are located
in the topmost layer of the Pd shell. A strong electron localization
(blue region in electron contour) appears and could be attributed
to local lattice strain around the Pt clusters. Presence of adsorbed
Pt atom in surface layer results in severe charge depletion (yellow
region in electron contour) and certain steric space for atomic O
adsorption (Oads). Those features are consistent with the
obtained structural parameters and explain the low reaction kinetics
(SA) in NPP-10 s. For the cases of Pt clusters embedded in the Pd
shell (NPP-2 h), regardless of steric configurations, all three models
possess strong electron localization with negative charge appearing
around the Pt clusters. Those negative-charge fields form a repulsive
force to weaken the Oads bond and provide a complex combination
of the reaction site identity. Both methods reduce the reaction barrier
for Oads evolution in the reaction sites, thereby significantly
improving the SA of NPP-2 h. For models of NPP-24 h, Pt cluster is
formed in the Pd–Ni interface or the Ni core crystal. In this
configuration, local lattice strain around the Pt cluster would couple
with lattice strain in the Pd–Ni interface. Such a coupling
effect triggers a strong electron relocation from the surface to the
Pt cluster, thus depleting surface electron in this model. It reduces
the identity of the reaction sites, delocalizes electron density,
and consequently reduces reaction kinetics in NPP-24 h.

interface and Ni3L core.

3 Conclusions
A robust method in terms of time
and ease of fabrication of the
Pt cluster-decorated NiPdPt ternary NC with tunable electrochemical
properties in the ORR is demonstrated. By cross-referencing the results
of structural characterization, electrochemical analysis, and density
functional theory calculations, we show that the atomic arrangement,
surface oxophilicity, reaction site identity, and, consequently, charge
density distribution of the ternary NCs can be engineered by changing
the Pt4+ adsorption time and the Pt content on the Ni@Pd
surface. Charge distribution in NCs is confined by local strain around
the Pt clusters. It varies with their intercalation depth as changes
with Pt4+ adsorption time. In optimum case with 14 atom
% of Pt content, specific surface activity (SA) is 0.732 mA cm–2 when Pt4+ adsorption time is 2 h. This
value is 2.8 times as compared to that of J.M.-Pt. Most importantly,
the proposed scenarios are mostly compatible to be adopted for catalyst
fabrication owing to simplicity and cost-effectiveness considerations
in industrial sector, therefore, highlighting the possibility of the
development of advanced alkaline fuel cell devices.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis Methodology and
Materials for Preparation
of Ni@Pd/Pt NCs
Atomic Pt clusters-decorated Ni@Pd NCs were
synthesized by using a sequential wet chemical reduction method in
a controlled environment, and the corresponding steps for synthesis
methodology are presented in Scheme 1. In the first step, 360 mg of catalyst support (multiwalled
carbon nanotube in ethylene glycol, 5 wt % Cnano Technology Ltd.)
is added to 1.28 g of aqueous solution containing 0.1 M of nickel(II)
chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, Showa
chemical Co. Ltd.) and stirred at 200 rpm at 25 °C for 6 h. The
mixture (Ni2+-adsorbed CNT, CNT-Niads) contains
0.128 mmol (7.5 mg) of Ni metal ions in a metal loading of Ni/CNT
= 30 wt %. After stirring, 5 mL of water solution containing 0.0386
g of NaBH4 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was added to the sample
prepared in the first step and the mixture stirred at 200 rpm for
10 s. In this step, metastable Ni metal nanoparticles were formed
(Ni/CNT sample). In step 3, 1.28 g of Pd precursor solution containing
0.128 mmol of Pd metal ions (i.e., 0.1 M) was added to Ni/CNT sample
to form a thin layer of Pd crystal on the surface of nickel nanoparticles
(namely, Ni@Pd) with a Ni/Pd ratio of 1.0. The Pd precursor solution
was prepared by dissolving the metal powder (Pd, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich
Co.) in 1.0 M HCl(aq). After 20 min, 0.383 g of Pt precursor solution
containing 0.0383 mmol of Pt ions (H2PtCl6·6H2O, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was added to the Ni@Pd solution
(step 4). In step 5, 5 mL of water solution containing 0.0116 g of
NaBH4 was added to the mixture of Pt4+ ion and
Ni@Pd, followed by stirring at 200 rpm for 2 h to complete Pt metal
reduction. The end products are atomic Pt clusters-decorated Ni@Pd/Pt
(NPP) NCs. In this step, distribution and depth of atomic Pt clusters
in the Pd shell region are controlled through adsorption (i.e., galvanic
replacement of Pd with Pt4+) time of Pt4+ in
the Ni@Pd surface and the Pt/Pd ratio of 0.3. In this study, samples
of Ni@Pd with Pt4+ adsorption times of 10 s, 2 h, and 24
h are, respectively, named NPP-10 s, NPP-2 h, and NPP-24 h. The resulted
powder is washed several times with acetone, centrifuged, and then
dried at 70° C, followed by natural cooling at room temperature.
The synthesis of Ni@Pd followed similar processes as those used to
prepare Ni@Pd/Pt, except that Pt metal precursor was absent in the
reaction system. Control samples (Pt-CNT and Pd-CNT) were synthesized
by immersing Pt (Pd) precursor solution in CNT at 25 °C for 6
h followed by adding reducing agent (0.023 mg of NaBH4 in
5.0 mL H2O). In the study, Pt (Pd)/CNT ratio is 30 wt %.
For comprehensive discussions, electrochemical properties of NPPs
in Pt/Pd ratios of 0.1 (namely NPP-01) and 0.2 (namely NPP-02) (synthesized
with identical sequences and time to those of NPP-03) are compared
in Figure 6. Details
of their structure-to-electrochemical correlations are given in the Supporting Information (SI).

4.2 Characterizations
of Ni@Pd/Pt Ternary NCs
Surface morphological features of
as-synthesized ternary NCs were
analyzed by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV in the Electron Microscopy
Center at National Chiao Tung University. The average coherent length
(Davg) of experimental NCs is calculated
from the XRD peak broadening of the (111) facets using the Scherrer
equation. For XRD analysis, the wavelength of incident X-ray is 0.7749
Å (16 keV) at a beamline of BL-01C2 at the National Synchrotron
Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan. The X-ray absorption near
edge spectroscopy (XANES) of the experimental NCs was analyzed in
the fluorescence mode at the BL-07A1 and BL-17C1 beamlines at the
NSRRC. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectroscopy of
the experimental NCs was executed to identify the surface chemical
states of the catalysts at BL-24A of the NSRRC (Hsinchu, Taiwan).
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under
open-circuit voltage conditions. During the measurements, the sinusoidal
amplitude modulation was set at 10 mV in the frequency range from
100 mHz to 1000 kHz and the spectrum was recorded in an alkaline medium
(0.1 M KOH) starting at high frequency and moving toward low frequency
in a logarithmic scan. The electrochemical measurements were carried
out at room temperature using a potentiostat (CH Instruments model
600B) equipped with a three-electrode system. The cyclic voltammetry
(CV) and the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) data were acquired at
the voltage scan rate of 0.02 and 0.001 V s–1 and
the potential range of 0.1–1.3 V (V vs RHE) and 0.4–1.1
V (V vs RHE), respectively, in an aqueous alkaline electrolyte solution
of 0.1 M KOH (pH 13). The rotation rate of 1600 rpm was used for LSV.
N2 and O2 atmospheres were used for CV and LSV,
respectively. CNT-supported Ni@Pd/Pt catalyst, 5.0 mg, was mixed with
isopropyl alcohol (1 mL) and 5 wt % Nafion (0.05 mL) to prepare slurry
sample. The mixture was subjected to ultrasonication treatment for
30 min before ORR experiment. A glossy carbon rotating disk electrode
(0.196 cm2 area) coated with 10.0 μL of the desired
catalyst slurry sample, followed by air drying, is used as the working
electrode. Hg/HgCl2 (the voltage was calibrated by 0.242
V, in alignment with that of RHE) electrode saturated in KCl aqueous
solution and a platinum wire was used as a reference electrode and
a counter electrode, respectively.

4.3 Computation
Details for Density Functional
Theory Calculations on Charge Density Distribution of Ni@Pd with Atomic
Pt Cluster Decoration in Different Depths
To elucidate the
experimental observations, we employed first-principles calculations
based on the density functional theory (DFT) using the Vienna ab initio
simulation package26,27 with the projector augmented
wave pseudopotentials.28 A plane-wave basis
set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 420 eV was used to expand the
Kohn–Sham wave functions. The Pd–Ni alloy surface is
simulated by a repeated slab with a 4 × 4 lateral periodicity
in which three Pd top layers and three Ni bottom layers are included.
All atoms in the simulation model are fully relaxed. The vacuum region
between slabs is ∼15 Å. The Brillouin zone is sampled
with a 5 × 5 × 1 k-point mesh, which produces
well-converged results. The geometry is optimized until the total
energy is converged to 10–4 eV. The total charge
density difference is obtained by subtracting the total charge density
of the Pt-contained alloy model from that of the Pt-free alloy model.
