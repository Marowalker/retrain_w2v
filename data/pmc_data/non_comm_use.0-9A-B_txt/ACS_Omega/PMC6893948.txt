Polyelectrolyte complex nanoparticles (PEC NPs) are synthesized
using two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, i.e., anionic poly(sodium
4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and cationic poly(diallyldimethylammoniumchloride),
at molar mixing ratios (n–/n+) of ≈0.4, 0.67, 0.75, and 1.5 by applying
consecutive centrifugation to modify the optical property of PSS.
However, for n–/n+ ≈ 0.75, PEC NPs exhibit a larger blue shift and
a specific emission peak occurs at ≈278 nm for the 225 nm excitation.
The mechanism of such modification of PSS emission after complex formation
is proposed. This specific emission by PEC NPs nearly matches with
the optical absorption wavelength of globular proteins. The emission
intensity of PEC NPs is therefore quenched in the presence of globular
proteins (bovine serum albumin, human serum albumin, lysozyme, and
hemoglobin) through resonance energy transfer between the donor (PEC
NPs) and acceptor (globular proteins). The spectral overlap integral
and the variation of the separation distance from 1.8 to 2.5 nm between
the donor and acceptor confirm the resonance energy transfer. Sensing
of proteins by the PEC NPs is possible within the detection limit
of 5 nM and therefore such PEC NPs can be used as an efficient and
promising protein sensing material.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Hyperalbuminemia or hypoalbuminemia
are conditions that occur due
to the quantitative variation of albumin protein in the human body
and cause inflammation of the liver, bone marrow disorder, chronic
hepatitis, kidney disorder, etc.1,2 Various kinds of experimental
methods have been developed to improve the protein detection method;
however, sensitivity remains a major issue. Therefore, there is a
need to develop a better effective method to avoid different protein-related
diseases.3−5

In recent decades, due to the impressive improvement
of nanotechnology,
it is easily possible to fabricate and characterize specific nanoparticles
(NPs) for their specific applications.6,7 There are different
types of NPs, e.g., metallic, semiconducting, magnetic, polymeric,
etc., which can be prepared by both physical and chemical methods.
Metallic Au and Ag nanoclusters, containing few metal atoms have achieved
considerable attention due to their intrinsic attractive fluorescence
properties and hence have potential applications in different fields
of chemical sensing, optical sensing, biological imaging, etc.8−10 For example, it has been found that the detection limit of thrombin
protein can go down to 1 nM using aptamer-Ag nanoclusters (NCs) in
the fluorescence-quenching-based method.4 A simple and sensitive aptamer-based colorimetric sensing of protein
was also studied using Au NPs, where detection was done through the
color change of Au nanoparticles in the presence of thrombin protein
of nanomolar concentration.11 Apart from
the metallic NCs or NPs, polymeric nanoparticles can also be used
as a promising candidate for protein sensing. Currently, polyelectrolyte
systems are getting considerable attention in nano- and biotechnology
especially in the fields of sensors, drug delivery, bioimaging, etc.12−15 Polyelectrolytes are classically used in colloid stabilization,
water purification, paper making, food thickening, etc.16,17 Several techniques have been reported for the formation of polymeric
NPs from soft matters, which include oppositely charged polyelectrolytes
to form stable intermolecular complexes.18 Formation of soluble oppositely charged polyelectrolyte complexes
and the formation of polyelectrolyte complex nanoparticles (PEC NPs)
from polymers containing both weak and strong ionic groups were demonstrated
and studied extensively.19,20 Monomodal PEC NP dispersion
could be significantly improved by applying consecutive centrifugation,
separation, and redispersion steps of the coacervate, which accelerates
the ripening of primary particles to secondary particles.20,21 Primary particles are suggested to consist ideally of only one or
realistically a few polycation and polyanion pairs held together by
long-range electrostatic interactions, and secondary particles of
PEC dispersion consist of few primary particles held together by short-range
dispersive interactions that accelerate under centrifugation.20,21 Many physical parameters like charge mixing ratio, polyelectrolyte
size, charge density, presence of ions, and concentration of polyelectrolytes
play an important role in the size and charge of the PEC NPs.21−23 Formation of stable PEC NPs also depends on the local polymer chain
stiffness and the relative molecular weight. It is found that wood
cellulose-based PEC NPs are suitable for encapsulating sensitive therapeutic
active agents such as proteins and peptides, and these novel PEC NPs
can be used as a potential delivery carrier for proteins and drugs.12 Poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium
chloride) (PDADMAC) are two commercially available strong polyelectrolytes,
and their structures are independent of solution pH. PSS is optically
active due to the π → π* and π → n
transitions, which originate from the aromatic ring present inside
PSS. Its optical property can be modified by employing different treatments
like changing ionic environments, forming composites with different
materials, etc.24,25 PSS can be used as an ion exchange
resin for medical applications, water softening, removing heavy toxic
ions from water, etc.26,27 PDADMAC can be used to modify
solid surfaces or to form composites, which are novel materials for
removing some organic pollutants such as hydrophobic dyes, isoproturon,
etc.28,29 Although different studies are going on
for preparing new PEC NPs and for their potential applications, it
will be very much effective to provide a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
protein sensing material by using PEC NPs.

In this article,
we have prepared polyelectrolyte complex nanoparticles
using consecutive centrifugation and redispersion cycles of nonstoichiometric
molar mixing ratios ranging from 0.4 to 1.5 (n–/n+ ≈ 0.4, 0.67,
0.75, and 1.5) of the constituent polyelectrolytes for having a specific
optical emission property of the prepared NPs, which can be used in
an optical sensing method of globular proteins within the detection
limit of 5 nM. Two strong polyelectrolytes, namely, poly(sodium 4-styrene
sulfonate) (PSS) and poly(diallyldimethylammoniumchloride) (PDADMAC),
are chosen for the preparation of PEC NPs. It is found that the composition,
size, and polydispersity within a PEC system can be influenced by
the consecutive centrifugation and redispersion cycles. The characterization
of PEC NPs is done using dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force
microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and zeta
potential measurements. Excitation wavelengths of the optically active
PEC NPs are obtained from UV–vis spectroscopy, which are found
at ≈225 and 260 nm. Quenching of fluorescence emission of PEC
NPs and from that the sensing behaviors in the presence of bovine
serum albumin (BSA), human serum albumin (HSA), lysozyme (Lys), and
hemoglobin (Hbg) proteins within the concentration range of 5–70
nM are studied using photoluminescence spectrophotometry (PL).

2 Results and Discussion
Preparation
of PEC NPs after consecutive centrifugation and the
chemical structures of PSS and PDADMAC are shown in Figure 1. Consecutive centrifugation
of the PEC solution accelerates the ripening of heterogeneous PEC
dispersion,30 and thereby, excess polyelectrolytes
or smaller PEC particles form larger particles or help in the complexation
of excess polyelectrolytes under the centrifugal force.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of PEC NP preparation using anionic PSS
and cationic PDADMAC polyelectrolytes followed by the consecutive
centrifugations. Chemical structures of PSS and PDADMAC are shown
inside the figure.

After preparation, the hydrodynamic sizes of PEC-0.4
NPs, PEC-0.67
NPs, PEC-0.75 NPs, and PEC-1.5 NPs followed by two times consecutive
centrifugations were found as 320, 280, 145, and 245 nm, respectively,
which are shown in Figure 2. At n–/n+ ≈ 0.4, the concentration of long-chain polymer
PDADMAC is high compared to the other complexations, and as a result,
relatively bigger size particles were formed, which are shown in Figure 2a. As n–/n+ increases, i.e.,
the concentration of PSS increases, there is a decrease in the particle
size as complexation becomes more, and due to that, after centrifugations,
the particles are gradually squeezed. However, for n–/n+ ≈ 0.75,
the particle size is smaller than that for n–/n+ ≈ 1.5, which
is shown in Figure 2c,d, respectively. Probably, at this molar mixing ratio, the intermolecular
interactions are more compared to the other nonstoichiometric complexations.
Further, when n–/n+ ≈ 1.5, i.e., PSS amount is more, there is formation
of bigger size particles as compared to those obtained at n–/n+ ≈
0.75; in addition, one more
particle size distribution is found at around ≈3 nm, which
is due to the presence of primary particles.

Figure 2 Hydrodynamic size of
PEC NPs after consecutive centrifugation for
(a) PEC-0.4 NPs (320 nm), (b) PEC-0.67 NPs (280 nm), (c) PEC-0.75
NPs (145 nm), and (d) PEC-1.5 NPs (245 nm).

The corresponding zeta potentials of the particles
are shown in Figure 3, which are found
as ≈+26.4, +24.1, +23.8, and −25.2 mV for PEC-0.4 NPs,
PEC-0.67 NPs, PEC-0.75 NPs, and PEC-1.5 NPs, respectively. This result
confirms the existence of positive surface charge for PEC-0.4 NPs,
PEC-0.67 NPs, and PEC-0.75 NPs, whereas the negative surface charge
for PEC-1.5 NPs. The zeta potential values also confirm the stability
of the NPs. The hydrodynamic size and corresponding zeta potential
values are tabulated in Table S1. The highly
charged surface of NPs leads to high repulsive potential that exceeds
the interparticle van der Walls attraction between the hydrophobic
cores of neighborhood PEC NPs and thus the stability is maintained.31,32 The stability of such colloidal nanoparticles with aging is maintained,
and as a result, no agglomeration and modification in hydrodynamic
size are evident.

(26.4 mV),
(b) PEC-0.67 (24.1 mV), (c) PEC-0.75 (23.8 mV), and (d) PEC-1.5 (−25.2
mV).

UV–vis absorption and emission behaviors
of PEC NPs compared
with pure PSS are shown in Figure 4a. There are two UV–vis absorption peaks found
at ≈225 and 260 nm for all PEC NPs, which are originated from
the aromatic ring of PSS due to the π → π* and
π → n transitions, respectively.25,33 The PEC-0.4 NPs and PEC-1.5 NPs exhibit photoluminescence emission
peaks at ≈294 and 298 nm, respectively, for 225 nm excitation,
which is shown in the inset of Figure 4a. However, PEC-0.67 NPs exhibit a prominent emission
peak at ≈296 nm and a weak peak at ≈278 nm, while PEC-0.75
NPs exhibit a sharp emission peak at ≈278 nm. The constituent
pure PSS exhibits a prominent emission peak at ≈310 nm and
a relatively weak peak at ≈360 nm for the same excitation.25 Therefore, although there are 16, 14, and 12
nm blue shifts for PEC-0.4 NPs, PEC-0.67 NPs, and PEC-1.5 NPs, respectively,
the maximum blue shift is found for PEC-0.75 NPs, i.e., ≈32
nm peak shift from the emission peak (more prominent one found at
310 nm) of pure PSS. Such a higher value of blue shift for PEC-0.75
NPs is unusual as there is no modification in the optical absorption
band as the UV-absorption peaks are also found nearly at the same
positions for both the pure PSS and PEC NPs. This is probably due
to more intermolecular interactions in the case of PEC-0.75 NPs after
the complex formation and centrifugation, and accordingly PSS is attached
relatively more strongly with PDADMAC. This strong attachment results
in vibrational relaxation of PSS after emitting a less amount of energy
as nonradiative decay, i.e., relatively less Stokes shift occurs in
comparison with the pure PSS. This result is unlike our previous report
where a protein fluorophore could provide more Stokes shift, i.e.,
a larger red shift after interaction with the anionic polyelectrolyte
poly(acrylic acid-Na salt).34 Therefore,
PEC-0.75 NPs provide specific optical emission at ≈278 nm for
the excitation of 225 nm, which can be utilized for the sensing of
globular proteins. The obtained extinction coefficient of PEC-0.75
NPs is 11 830 ± 426 M–1 cm–1 for 225 nm excitation. AFM analysis revealed the average size of
the PEC-0.75 NPs in the dry state having a diameter of ≈62
nm and height of ≈36 nm, which is shown in Figure 4b. The relatively smaller size
of PEC-0.75 NPs in the dry state compared to the hydrodynamic size
of ≈145 nm is primarily due to shrinkage of nanoparticles occurring
in the dry state as the water molecules present inside the polymeric
nanoparticles are evaporated.

confirmed by the
TEM image, which is shown in Figure 5, and the corresponding particle size distribution
is shown in the inset of the same figure. The particle size varies
from ≈41.0 to 93.2 nm with an average particle size of 65.6
± 11.2 nm. Moreover, the conformational study of PEC-0.75 NPs
is carried out using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
in ATR mode and compared with pure PSS and PDADMAC, which is shown
in Figure S1.

UV–vis absorption spectra of PEC-0.75 NPs
are characterized
in the presence of all four globular proteins within the concentration
range of 5–70 nM. It is found that the peak intensity of PEC-0.75
NPs enhances with an increase in the protein concentration and is
also shifted toward the protein absorption peak,25 which is shown for HSA and Lys in Figure 6a,b, respectively. The peak obtained at ≈225
nm becomes saturated as the protein concentration increases, whereas
the absorption peak at ≈260 nm exhibits a red shift to ≈271
and 275 nm for HSA and Lys, respectively.

of (a) HSA and (b) lysozyme (Lys) on a nanomolar level. Arrows indicate
the direction of increasing concentration of HSA and Lys from 0 to
70 nM.

The emission behavior of PEC-0.75 NPs is observed
in the presence
of globular proteins BSA, Lys, HSA, and Hbg at a very low concentration
(≈5–70 nM), which are shown in Figure 7a,d. At 280 nm excitation, the extinction
coefficients of BSA, Lys, HSA, and Hbg are found to be 52 621
± 1105, 39 455 ± 435, 41 800 ± 669, and
36 100 ± 542 M–1 cm–1, respectively. This result confirms that the emission peak of PEC-0.75
NPs is quenched in the presence of proteins and the quenching increases
linearly with increasing protein concentration. The quenching behaviors
of PEC-0.75 NPs in the presence of proteins are obtained using the
Stern–Volmer (SV) equation,35 where
the average Stern–Volmer constant, KSV, values are found as ≈8.83 × 106, 7.84 ×
106, 9.37 × 106, and 6.65 × 106 M–1 for the quencher BSA, Lys, HSA, and
Hbg, respectively. Fluorescence quenching is due to the fact that
the emitted photons from the PEC NPs (donor) are absorbed by the proteins
(acceptor) as the protein absorption also occurs at ≈278 nm
due to the presence of a relatively strong and optically active tryptophan
residue than the other two optically active aromatic amino acids tyrosine
and phenylalanine inside proteins.33,36,37 However, tyrosine also has a significant effect on
quenching of PEC NP emission. A previous report showed that poly(l-tyrosine) and proteins containing tyrosine exhibit an absorption
peak at ≈275 nm.38 The emission
behavior of PEC-0.75 NPs is also obtained in the presence of tryptophan
and tyrosine molecules to confirm that quenching takes place mostly
due to the presence of tryptophan and tyrosine residues inside the
protein. It is found that quenching of PEC-0.75 NPs increases with
increasing tryptophan and tyrosine concentrations, which are shown
in Figure S2a,b. Therefore, the combined
effect of tryptophan and tyrosine residues present inside globular
proteins is responsible for the PEC NP quenching. However, quenching
due to the presence of tryptophan is more compared to that in the
presence of tyrosine as the KSV values
are found as ≈9.5 × 103 and 5.2 × 103 M–1 for the tryptophan and tyrosine residues,
respectively, which are shown in the inset of Figure S2a,b. Thus, resonance energy transfer occurs between
the PEC NPs (donor) and proteins (acceptor); however, the amount of
quenching varies depending upon the number of tryptophan and tyrosine
residues and the charge of the protein molecules. The quenching, i.e., F0/F of PEC NPs vs the concentration
of all four proteins is shown in Figure 7e, which shows that among the four globular
proteins, in the presence of HSA, quenching is higher compared to
the others, probably as the isoelectric point (pI) of HSA (pI ≈ 4.7) is
lower compared to that of BSA (pI ≈
4.9) and Hbg (pI ≈ 6.8).39,40 Therefore, the net charge of HSA is more negative compared to the
other proteins and exhibits more electrostatic attraction between
the positively charged PEC NPs and negatively charged HSA. Although
protein takes net positive or negative charges below or above the pI, respectively, both local positive and negative
surface charge domains are always present, the relative amount of
which depends upon the surrounding pH.41 Due to the electrostatic interaction, as the HSA protein molecule
comes closer to the PEC NPs, resonance energy transfer becomes more,
and as a result, quenching enhances. In the case of lysozyme, although
it has a net positive surface charge as pI ≈ 11.2, due to the presence of relatively less amount of
localized negative surface charge and the presence of more tryptophan
residues on the surface compared to the other protein molecules, the
quenching amount is higher than that in Hbg. Actually, the combined
effects of protein surface charges and the number of tryptophan and
tyrosine residues present on the surface of proteins modify the quenching
amount. There are one, two, three, and six tryptophan residues present
inside HSA, BSA, Hbg, and lysozyme proteins, respectively.34,42,43 The numbers of tyrosine residues
present inside HSA, BSA, lysozyme, and Hbg are 18, 21, 3, and 1 respectively.44−47 In this study, the effect of lysozyme is compared with the other
three globular proteins as it has a relatively more number of tryptophan
residues and relatively higher pI value.
Although apparently resonance energy transfer takes place between
the donor and acceptor, to confirm that the FRET condition must be
satisfied, the fluorescence emission spectrum of the donor must overlap
with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor. In Figure 7f, the spectral overlap between
PEC-0.75 NP emission and absorption of HSA is shown by the color shaded
portion and the corresponding J(λ) has been
found as ≈8.5 × 1011 nm4/(M cm).
Similarly, the J(λ) values for PEC-0.75 NPs–BSA,
PEC-0.75 NPs–Lys, and PEC-0.75 NPs–Hbg pairs are found
as ≈8.55 × 1011, 8.4 × 1011, and 8.7 × 1011 nm4/M cm, respectively. J(λ) values for PEC NPs–tryptophan and PEC
NPs–tyrosine pairs have also been obtained and found as 4.1
× 109 and 3.0 × 109 nm4/(M cm), which are tabulated in Table 1. The spectral overlap regions are shown in Figure S2c,d.

The quantum yield (QD)
measures the
radiative decay of PEC-0.75 NPs, and it is important to measure the
value of R0. Here, QD is measured using the comparative method,48 using well-characterized standard sample benzene as its
absorption and emission wavelength range varies within 220–265
and 270–300 nm, respectively. The standard benzene exhibits
absorption and emission peaks at 235 and 280 nm, respectively, which
are near to PEC-0.75 NPs. Essentially, solutions of the standard and
test sample with identical absorption at excitation wavelength can
be assumed to absorb the same number of photons. Hence, the ratio
of the integrated fluorescence intensities of the two samples represents
the ratio of the quantum yield values.49 In this method, QD can be measured using
the following equation 1  where QX and QST are the quantum yields of the test sample
(i.e., PEC-0.75 NPs) and standard sample (i.e., benzene, for which QST ≈ 0.05), respectively. ΔST and ΔX are the corresponding slopes of
the linear curves for the integrated intensity vs absorbance plots,
which are shown in Figure 8a,b, respectively, and η is the refractive index of
the solvent. After calculating the slopes from Figure 8 and putting the corresponding values in eq 1, the quantum yield of
PEC-0.75 NPs is obtained as ≈0.372 ± 0.0071.

Figure 8 Integrated
intensity vs absorbance value of (a) benzene as standard
and (b) PEC-0.75 NPs as test samples for quantum yield measurements. R2 and slope “Δ” of the linear
fitting are mentioned in the corresponding figures.

After measuring R0 and E, using eqs 3 and 5, respectively, the separation distance r between the donor and acceptor pairs are calculated using eq 6, which are shown in Table 1. The center-to-center
distance between the acceptor and donor varies within 10 nm, which
confirms the presence of resonance energy transformation50,51 between the donor and acceptor. FRET efficiency, which is a function
of the separation distance between the donor and acceptor, falls off
with the sixth power of separation distance and leads to a large change
in its value over a range of 0.5R0 to
1.5R0. The maximum, i.e., 98 to 100%,
energy transfer occurs at ≈0.5R0, and beyond 1.5R0, energy transfer is
<9%.60 In the present study, efficiencies
(E) are obtained as ≈7.8, 6.8, 4.1, and 3.2%
for the PEC-0.75 NPs–HSA, PEC-0.75 NPs–BSA, PEC-0.75
NPs–Lys, and PEC-0.75 NPs–Hbg donor–acceptor
pairs, respectively, as the separation distance (r) is increased chronologically. The quenching of PEC NPs in the presence
of tryptophan and tyrosine residues is better viewed by measuring
the separation distances of PEC NPs–tryp and PEC NPs–tyro
pairs, which are found as 11.8 and 11.1 Å, respectively. This
indicates that the resonance energy transfer takes place between the
PEC NPs and tryptophan/tyrosine residues.

To investigate the
effect of pH on the emission of PEC NPs, BSA
and Hbg solutions of 50 nM concentration are prepared in the presence
of PEC-0.75 NPs and the solution pH was varied from ≈4.0 to
8.0. The emission spectra of PEC-0.75 NPs in the presence of BSA and
Hbg with varying pH values are shown in Figure 9a,b. The emission intensity gradually decreases
as the pH value increases for both the BSA and Hbg proteins, which
is also shown in the inset of the corresponding figure. The quenching
of PEC NPs below the isoelectric point of BSA and Hbg is relatively
less; however, quenching enhances as the pH gradually increases above
the isoelectric point. The most probable reason is that as the isoelectric
points of BSA and Hbg are 4.9 and 6.8, respectively, the surface charge
of BSA and Hbg becomes positive below the isoelectric point. As a
result, the separation between the positively charged donor and acceptor
enhances due to electrostatic repulsion, which causes less amount
of energy transfer from the donor to acceptor. On the other hand,
as pH increases above the isoelectric point, the net surface charge
of globular proteins becomes negative, and as a result, separation
between the donor and acceptor decreases due to electrostatic attraction,
which helps to transfer relatively higher amount of energy from the
donor to acceptor.

For in vitro study, human blood is extracted and
serum is separated
after centrifugation of the blood. Optical emission of PEC-0.75 NPs
is observed in the presence of human blood serum with a small variation
in the amount of protein. The emission of PEC-0.75 NPs is quenched
after addition of 1 μL (≈40 μg/μL) of blood
serum in 3 mL of PEC NP solution. The concentration of blood serum
became ≈13.30 μg/mL, and the quenching progressively
increased with increasing blood/serum amount from ≈13.30 to
133.0 μg/mL. However, to compare the effect of proteins, externally
0.5 and 1.0 mg of HSA is added separately to 1 mL of blood serum to
vary the amount of albumin protein so that artificially a hyperalbuminemia
condition was developed and accordingly emission responses were observed.
In this case, the concentrations after addition of HSA in blood serum
became ≈13.47 and 13.64 μg/mL, and concentrations varied
from ≈13.47 to 134.7 and ≈13.64 to 136.4 μg/mL,
respectively. After addition of HSA in blood serum, quenching of PEC-0.75
NP emission is increased, and the amount of quenching increases linearly
as the protein amount increases, which is shown in Figure 10a. Similarly, to see the effect
and quantify a very small amount of Hbg, quenching of PEC-0.75 NP
emission is also observed from the blood sample and in the presence
of externally added Hbg, which is shown in Figure 10b. In this case, the concentration of added
blood to PEC NPs varied from ≈12.7 to 127 μg/mL. Like
HSA, quenching also increases linearly in the presence of Hbg added
(0.5 and 1.0 mg/mL) to the blood samples. After adding Hbg to the
blood, concentrations varied from ≈12.87 to 128.7 and ≈13.04
to 130.4 μg/mL, respectively. It is thus clear that the variation
of a very small amount of protein can be measured through the quenching
of PEC-0.75 NPs and it will be very much useful to quantify the amount
of protein and accordingly the deficiency or adequacy of protein in
blood.

3 Conclusions
Synthesized PEC-0.75 NPs
formed after consecutive centrifugations
are very promising and efficient materials for globular protein sensing.
The optical emission of PEC-0.75 NPs at ≈278 nm is due to the
less amount of Stokes shift of PSS inside PEC, which is the significant
unique property of PEC NPs for protein sensing on a nM level through
the FRET mechanism as globular proteins also show absorption at ≈278
nm. The occurrence of FRET mechanism is confirmed by calculating the
separation between the donor (PEC-0.75 NPs) and acceptor (proteins),
which varies within ≈18–24 Å. Optical emission
of PEC-0.75 NPs can be quenched in the presence of globular proteins
of nanomolar concentration and therefore after having a standard calibration
curve of a standard protein (e.g., globular serum), the deficiency
or adequacy of that particular protein can be quantified on a nM level.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Commercially available
anionic polyelectrolyte PSS (Mw ≈
70 kDa, Catalog No. 243051) and cationic polyelectrolyte PDADMAC (Mw ≈ 250 kDa, Catalog No. 409014) were
purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The concentrations of polyelectrolyte
solutions were chosen in such a way that the obtained molar ratios
(n–/n+) were ≈0.4, 0.67, 0.75, and 1.5 having total polymer concentration
of ≈0.2 mM. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Mw ≈ 66 kDa, Catalog No: A2153), human serum albumin
(HSA) (Mw ≈ 64.5 kDa, Catalog No.
A3782), lysozyme (Lys) (Mw ≈ 65
kDa, Catalog No. 62971), hemoglobin (Hbg) (Mw ≈ 64 kDa, Catalog No. H7379), l-tryptophan
amino acid (Mw ≈ 204.32 Da, Catalog
No. T0254), and l-tyrosine amino acids (Mw ≈ 181.19 Da, Catalog No. T3754) were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich. Benzene (Merck 99%) was used as a standard for
quantum yield measurement of PEC NPs. All chemicals were used without
further purification, and solutions of these globular proteins of
nanomolar (nM)-level concentrations were prepared by dissolving in
Milli-Q water.

4.2 Preparation of Stable PEC NPs
Polyelectrolyte
complex nanoparticles can be synthesized using various methods as
per requirements. In this study, PEC dispersion is prepared by direct
mixing of two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes PSS and PDADMAC
at molar mixing ratios of ≈0.4, 0.67, 0.75, and 1.5, which
are designated as PEC-0.4 NPs, PEC-0.67 NPs, PEC-0.75 NPs, and PEC-1.5
NPs, respectively, after the complex nanoparticle formation, and the
same notation is used throughout the text. After stirring for a definite
period of time, the newly formed PEC dispersion (50 mL) was treated
for further consecutive centrifugation by applying a rotational speed
of 11 000 rpm for 20 min.52,53 Three different
phases were formed after centrifugation: a supernatant fraction with
only weak turbidity, a small fraction of coacervate, and a solid insoluble
rubberlike precipitate, which upon drying becomes a very hard and
brittle substance. After carefully decanting the supernatant fraction,
the remaining coacervate fraction was removed by a pipette and redispersed
in Milli-Q water of the same volume (50 mL) as was used before centrifugation.
Another two cycles of centrifugations were performed in a similar
manner, and finally, the PEC NP solution was prepared by taking the
coacervate part from the final centrifugation, redispersed in Milli-Q
water of the same volume of 50 mL, and stirred for 2 h at 800 rpm.
The formed PEC NPs were characterized for their surface charge through
the zeta potential and size by intensity-weighted distribution of
hydrodynamic diameter through DLS (Malvern Zetasizer Nano series,
nano ZS90).

4.3 Experimental Methods
The Malvern
Zetasizer Nano series (nano ZS90) was used to estimate the average
hydrodynamic sizes and zeta potentials of the prepared PEC NPs. Optical
properties of the prepared PEC NPs and PEC NPs in the presence of
globular proteins are characterized using UV–vis and photoluminescence
spectroscopy techniques. UV–vis absorption spectroscopy was
performed using a Shimadzu UV-1800 UV–vis spectrophotometer.
Fluorescence spectroscopy was carried out using a fluorescence spectrometer
(Jasco FP-8500) within a range of 225–450 nm with the excitation
wavelength of 225 nm for PEC NPs. During data collection, a 5 nm slit
width was used for both the excitation and emission monochromators.
Particle size distribution was determined by a transmission electron
microscope (TEM) using a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope. The distribution
of particle size of such PEC NPs in a dry state was also obtained
from atomic force microscopy (AFM) (NTEGRA Prima, NT-MDT technology)
in semicontact mode using a silicon cantilever having a spring constant
of ≈11.2 N/m.52,54 Scans were performed over several
portions of the films for different scan areas. To obtain the particle
size distribution, PEC NPs were spread over a Si(001) substrate using
the spin-coating method at 1000 rpm having the same accelerating and
control time of 60 seconds. Before spreading, Si(001) and quartz substrates
were cleaned separately after keeping in a mixed solution of ammonium
hydroxide (NH4OH, Merck, 30%), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, Merck, 30%), and Milli-Q water (NH4OH:H2O2:Milli-Q = 1:1:2, by volume) for 5–10
min at 100 °C.

4.4 PEC NP–Protein Dispersion
Preparation of PEC NPs/protein dispersion was done using nM level
of proteins after dilution from the stock solutions of proteins. The
measured pH values of all of the globular protein solutions are found
as ≈6.7, 6.4, 3.4, and 6.5 for BSA, HSA, lysozyme, and Hbg,
respectively, whereas the pH of PEC NPs is found as ≈5.7. Accordingly,
the dilute protein solution was added to the PEC NP solution so that
the concentration of protein could be varied from 5 to 70 nM with
the total volume of ≈3 ml. To investigate the fluorescence
quenching in the presence of all four globular proteins (BSA, HSA,
Hbg, and lysozyme), solutions of each protein having one-fourth of
the final concentration were added together to have a final protein
solution. The concentrations of such final protein solutions were
then varied within a range from 5 to 70 nM. The pH values of the PEC
NP–protein dispersions are found as ≈6.1, 4.62, 5.8,
and 6.04 for PEC NP–BSA, PEC NP–Lys, PEC NP–HSA,
and PEC NP–Hbg, respectively. UV–vis absorption and
emission spectra were obtained from the pure PEC NP solution and also
in the presence of four globular proteins of nM concentrations. The
chosen concentration of prepared PEC-0.75 NPs (≈9.2 μM)
was such that the absorption intensity was less than 0.1 to avoid
the inner filter effect. It is found that the inner filter effect
can be minimized by diluting the solution concentration.55,56 The secondary inner filter effect due to reabsorption of PEC NP
emission is also negligible as the absorption of PEC NPs is really
very less at 278 nm. The emission spectrum of PEC NPs in the presence
of BSA and Hbg with varying pH from ≈4.0 to 8.0 is also recorded
to ensure any structural modification of PEC NPs. The pH variation
of protein (BSA and Hbg) solution is done using HCl and NaOH stock
solutions. Further, the absorption and emission spectra of PEC NPs
in the presence of BSA and Hbg with varying pH values from ≈4.0
to 8.0 is also carried out to ensure any structural modification of
PEC NPs. To quantify the protein amount in human blood and blood serum,
an in vitro study was performed. The human blood sample availed from
a pathological laboratory was subjected to centrifugation to separate
the serum from the blood. Externally, 0.5 and 1 mg/mL Hbg and HSA
were also added to the blood and blood serum to vary the protein amount
so that artificially hyperalbuminemia condition could be developed
where the level of serum is relatively higher. For statistical analysis,
all tests were performed in triplicate to ensure the reliability and
reproducibility of the obtained results. The maximum errors for the
protein sensing measurements were varied from 2.5 to 6.8%.

4.5 Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)
Formalism
Förster resonance energy transfer occurs
between two molecules, often regarded as an acceptor–donor
pair, where the nonradiative energy transfers from the photoexcited
donor to the closely situated acceptor. The phenomenon involves the
dipole–dipole interactions and is thus strongly dependent on
the center-to-center separation between the donor and acceptor, where
it requires a nonzero spectral overlap integral between the donor
emission and acceptor absorption.57−59 An appropriate selection
of the donor–acceptor pair offers higher transfer efficiency
and provides two measurable parameters: the quenched donor emission
and enhanced acceptor emission. A good spectral overlap integral and
the separation between the donor and acceptor are paramount to high
transfer efficiency. Förster showed that the efficiency of
the FRET process depends on the inverse sixth power of the separation
distance (r) between the acceptor and donor, which
is expressed as57 2  where R0 is the
Förster critical distance and is defined as the acceptor–donor
separation radius at which the rate of energy transfer is equal to
the donor decay rate in the absence of acceptor. Therefore, at R0, the energy transfer efficiency is 50%.57 The value of R0 (nm)
can be expressed as 3  where a standard value of K2 ≈ 2/3 is taken for randomly oriented dipoles.57,60 The selection of such a standard K2 value
is valid at least for the small peptide and protein molecules. J(λ) is the spectral overlap integral between the
acceptor and donor, where the wavelength (λ) is expressed in
nanometer; η is the refractive index of the medium and is known
from the solvent composition; and QD is
the quantum yield of the donor, which must be measured accurately
to have a proper estimate of the FRET measurement.

The spectral
overlap integral J(λ) can be defined as56 4  where εA is the extinction
coefficient spectrum of the acceptor in units of M–1 cm–1, λ is the wavelength in nm, and FD is the wavelength-dependent normalized donor
emission spectrum. The FRET efficiency can be measured experimentally
and defined as56,61 5  where FDA and FD are the integrated fluorescence intensities
of the donor in the presence and absence of acceptor, respectively. Equations 2 and 5 can be combined to measure the separation between the donor
and acceptor pair, which is expressed as 6  and can be experimentally measured from the
fluorescence data
