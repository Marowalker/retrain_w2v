1 Introduction
Coal is the world’s
second largest energy resource and is
the primary energy resource in China. Coal-fired power generation
is the dominant source of obtaining power both in China and the world.
This situation is considered to remain unchanged for the coming few
decades.1 Globally, wet coal preparation
technology was in use to prepare coal. However, with the new coal
mining areas transferred to cold and arid regions,2 over two-third of the coal resources is now scattered all
over the drought hit region of western China.3 Therefore, it is urgent to study efficient dry separation technology.
The existing dry separation technology mainly includes wind jigging
machines,4−6 compound dry separation technology,7−9 and dry dense medium fluidized bed technology.10−12 At present,
desulfurization and separation technology of fine coal has become
a hot research topic in dry coal preparation technology. Generally,
the medium of dense phase gas–solid fluidized bed is magnetite
powder. In the process, the complicated abrasion condition of magnetite
particles and formation process of fine particles can be analyzed
by studying the abrasion model and particle size distribution of the
magnetite particles.13

Chemical and
biological desulfurization technologies can remove
inorganic sulfur and organic sulfur in coal, but problems such as
high cost, long production cycles, and pollution still remain to be
addressed. Physical desulfurization methods can only remove inorganic
sulfur and are economical and practical in nature.14,15 High-gradient magnetic separation technology is an effective method
for physical desulfurization, which can be used to deal with fine
particles of paramagnetic minerals and is applied to the desulfurization
of fine coal (mainly pyrite).16,17 The magnetic properties
of pyrite can be improved by heating treatment.18 Compared with coal, pyrite can be heated more rapidly due
to its higher dielectric constant.19 Microwave
radiation is an effective technique for heat treatment and has the
advantages of rapid heating process, selective heating, and uniform
heat distribution.20 The magnetic properties
of the pyrite in the coal are enhanced, which is more favorable for
the magnetic separation technology.21−23 For low-rank coal (lignite),
microwave heat treatment can significantly reduce the water content
and increase its calorific value and fixed carbon content, hence improving
the quality of lignite energy.24,25 Additionally, microwave
heat treatment is also conducive to act as a followup treatment step
to the frictional electrical selection operation.26 Microwave heat treatment selectively gets absorbed in the
pyrite and improves the absorption ability of the fine coal layers
for microwaves on a magnetic medium. Due to these characteristics,
the magnetic field gradient and magnetic properties of the pyrite
have been enhanced and desulfurization effect has been optimized.27

The main research content of this paper
is to study the mechanism
of microwave absorption capacity of the magnetic medium. A mechanism
for the microwave energy absorption of fine coal is proposed by obtaining
the parameters of dielectric properties of the magnetic medium. The
prediction model of electromagnetic parameters during the process
of microwave dielectric enhancement of fine coal is established by
using the neural network method.

2 Experimental
System and Mechanism
2.1 Experimental System
E5071C Vector-Network
analyzer was used to measure dielectric and electromagnetic properties
of an radio frequency network formed by the samples. The analyzer
has an adjustable range of test frequency from 300 kHz to 8.5 GHz,
with a typical scanning rate of about 9.6 ms/p. It possesses functions
for powerful analysis, error correction, and calibration. Microwave
pretreatment was performed in a nitrogen/air processing system, as
shown in Figure 1.
The system consists of a nitrogen protective device, microwave treatment
device nitrogen controller, and nitrogen storage device. A microwave
frequency of 2.45 GHz was set for the treatment, with a continuously
adjustable power, ranging from 0 to 1000 W. The RE Roll adopted a
novel punch-out type permanent magnet-based separation and purification
equipment. Table 1 shows
the numerical analysis for sulfur in four kinds of test samples.

2.2 Microwave Energy Absorption
Process
The ability of fine coal to absorb energy in the
microwave heat pretreatment
process was enhanced through the magnetic medium, even though the
microwave energy was converted into heat energy. The absorption ability
of the microwave treatment sample was mainly dependent upon two conditions.
First is the microwave energy’s attenuation performance in
the interior of the material and is called the attenuation characteristic.
Second is how far the microwave energy penetrates the sample. This
second condition means that the sample should have better matching
characteristics.

The magnetic parameters of fine coal could
be improved effectively through magnetic medium, especially the imaginary
part of complex permeability and the attenuation performance of the
microwave energy in fine coal.

As shown in Figure 2, the model for the microwave
energy absorption mechanism is strengthened
by the magnetic medium. The incident microwave energy E gets absorbed into the granular layer of fine coal. The microwave
energy decays through the dynamic dielectric polarization relaxation
and magnetization relaxation, and E1 amount
of energy is reflected. The energy loss of dynamic dielectric polarization
relaxation and magnetization relaxation increases through more magnetic
medium. The reduction of microwave reflection energy is E2. The energy which gets transferred from the magnetic
medium particles to fine coal layers through conduction and radiation
processes is E1′. Microwave radiation and heat conduction
existed simultaneously in the pretreatment process by microwave energy.
Thermal conductivity and utilization of microwave energy by pyrite
in the coal had both been improved.

adding medium.

3 Discussion
and Analysis
3.1 Optimization Mechanism of Permeability Response
Behavior of Fine Coal
The absorption process of microwave
energy in fine coal is a kind of electromagnetic response process.
The electromagnetic wave energy was converted into heat energy so
that the microwave energy would be absorbed through dielectric and
magnetic losses.

Magnetic medium consisted of magnetite particles
and absorbent for the microwave energy of the two losing media. As
a wave absorbing medium, the characteristic of magnetic loss is the
main property of the magnetic medium. According to different contents
of the magnetic media, the corresponding response relationship between
different fine coal and magnetic properties was established.

The real part of the complex permeability of fine coal samples
μ′ represents the internal storage capacity and the capacity
of the coal sample under an external alternating magnetic field. The
magnetic medium contents of fine coal were found to be 1, 3, 5, 8,
and 10%, respectively. As shown in Figure 3, for Lu’an fine coal, the real part
of the complex permeability μ′ increases with an increase
in the medium’s content. But the overall change is smaller,
and the trend is similar to that of the fine coal. The real part of
the complex permeability μ′ decreases with the increase
of frequency. The range of change appears to be diminishing. Lu’an
coal belongs to sulfur coal, and therefore when the microwave frequency
is larger than the range of 2 GHz, the real part of complex permeability
μ′ shows small fluctuation in the amplitude. The increase
in range of the real part of complex permeability μ′
is (0, 0.05) through the magnetic medium, and the increase in amplitude
is small. The overall trend remains consistent and shows a trend similar
to that of the fine raw coal.

Figure 3 Real part of permeability of Lu’an coal
with different contents
of magnetite with microwave frequency.

The imaginary part of complex permeability μ″
represents
the energy loss of the coal sample under the action of an external
alternating magnetic field. During the process of dynamic magnetization,
the imaginary part μ″ and the real part μ′
change with the frequency of the alternating magnetic field. At the
same time, the magnetic dispersion is caused by the magnetization
relaxation. As shown in Figure 4, when the magnetic medium is not added to the raw coal, the
range of change for the complex permittivity’s imaginary part
is (0, 0.20). With the gradual increase of magnetic medium, the imaginary
part of the complex dielectric constant also increases.

Figure 4 Imaginary part
of permeability of Lu’an coal with different
contents of magnetite with microwave frequency.

The imaginary part of complex permeability μ″
represents
the energy loss of the coal sample under the action of an external
alternating magnetic field. The magnetic medium is helpful in improving
the whole absorption capacity of the fine coal. As shown in Figure 5, when the magnetic
media content is 10%, the imaginary part of the complex dielectric
constant is increased by 2.5 times. The resonance peak appears when
the added amount is 10%.

3.2 Absorption Characteristics of Fine Coal in
Medium Strengthening Process
Figures 6 and 7 show the curves
of microwave reflection coefficient against the frequency for the
magnetic medium content of 0 and 2%, respectively. In the test frequency
range, only one microwave absorption peak appeared at the thickness
values of 0.005, 0.010, and 0.015 m. Two peaks appeared at the thickness
values of 0.020, 0.025, and 0.030 m. Three peaks appeared at the thickness
values of 0.035 and 0.040 m. According to the odd number principle
of microwave wavelength l(1/4), the incident microwave
gets divided into two parts. One is the reflection, whereas the other
is the one that gets absorbed in the coal sample. If the microwave
energy, which has entered into the coal, was not absorbed, then the
microwave would get reflected. When the phase difference between the
first and second reflection waves is an odd multiple of 1/4l, then the two microwaves cancel each other’s effect
and produce an absorption peak at the interface. With the increase
in the thickness (d) of the Lu’an coal, the
maximum attenuation frequency shifts to low frequency and the value
of the absorption peak increases. This is mainly due to the interference
of fine coal’s thickness to the incident and reflection waves.
As shown in Figure 7, the first peak (compared with the low-frequency peak) gradually
increases with an increase in the thickness of Lu’an coal.
The second peak is much larger than that for the peak value of the
low frequency and is consistent with the pattern of change for the
relative low-frequency peak value; their values gradually increase
with the increase in the thickness of the Lu’an coal; whereas
the third absorption peak (compared with the peak frequency) decreases
gradually with the increase in thickness of the Lu’an coal
samples. If the magnetic content increases, the number of absorption
peaks will remain unchanged. As the coal thickness continues to increase,
more absorption peaks will appear.

Figure 6 Reflection coefficient of microwave of
Lu’an with content
of 0 and 2% magnetic medium with microwave frequency.

Figure 7 Reflection coefficient of microwave of Lu’an coal
with content
of 5 and 10% magnetic medium with microwave frequency.

The absorption of microwave energy is determined
by the electromagnetic
parameters and thickness of the coal samples. Meanwhile, the central
frequency position of the absorption peak is determined by the magnetic
content and thickness of coal samples. Thickness is the main influencing
factor. Under the same coal thickness, with an increase of magnetic
medium content, the peak value is greatly improved. When the thickness
was 0.040 m, the peak values of relatively low frequency were −1.79,
−2.02, −2.64, and −2.53 dB at the magnetic medium
content of 0, 2, 5, and 10%, respectively. The middle peak values
of Lu’an coal were −3.94, −4.67, −5.28,
and −7.69 dB, respectively. The peak values of relatively high
frequency were −4.75, −6.20, −6.88, and −12.28
dB. Overall, with an increase in the magnetic medium’s content,
the corresponding peak value increased but at the relatively low-frequency
peak area, especially for the magnetic medium content larger than
5%, the peak value decreased and the relatively low frequency was
near the commonly used microwave frequency of 2.45 Hz. What deserved
more attention was that, when the added amount was 10%, the best peak
value appeared in the coal sample having a thickness of 0.035 m and
the corresponding value was −16.55 dB in the test range of
microwaves.

3.3 Magnetic Medium’s
Absorption Enhancement
Mechanism
When the thickness of Luan fine coal is 0.010 m,
varying the frequency changes the reflection coefficients of different
magnetic media contents. Figure 8 shows the analysis of absorption characteristics (d = 0.010 m) of different magnetic media contents of Lu’an
coal. The results show that the absorption characteristics of fine
coal have greatly been improved for the absorption ability of microwave
energy by improving the overall content of magnetic media. As shown
in Figure 8, when Luan
coal additive contents were 5 and 10%, the absorption peak was increased
2 and 2.5 times of the value when no additive was used. The absorption
peak bandwidth has been greatly improved with the increase of the
content of magnetic medium in fine coal. It can effectively improve
the adaptability of the process design of microwave enhancement and
provide effective theoretical support for guiding the selection of
pretreatment parameters.

Figure 8 Absorption characteristics of Lu’an coal
with different
contents of magnetic medium (d = 0.010 m).

The position of absorption peak
center frequency was determined
by the magnetic content and thickness of Lu’an coal. Coal thickness
effect is the main factor. The center frequency of the absorption
peak increases with an increase of the magnetic medium, and there
is a certain amount of deviation in the direction of low frequency.
The magnetic medium is helpful for the coal sample to lower frequency
shift of the absorption peak of the microwave energy and provides
support for the design of the strengthening process of the microwave
pretreatment.

3.4 Prediction Model for Microwave
Electromagnetic
Parameter Response
Due to the consideration of operating
conditions and coal quality characteristics, the prediction model
of influencing factors includes a number of variables, such as microwave
frequency, magnetic media content, and coal characteristics, including
moisture, ash content, fixed carbon content, volatile, organic sulfur,
and pyritic sulfur content. Due to the influence of many factors,
the characteristics were nonlinear. It is difficult to establish the
relationship between electromagnetic parameters and influencing factors.
The forecasting method of the traditional model cannot reach a better
forecast analysis. In the electromagnetic parameters of the neural
network prediction model of the fine coal bearing layer and the output
layer, the transfer function is tansig and the number of neurons in
the output layer node prediction model is 1. The maximum number of
iterations is 50 000. The prediction accuracy of target is
0.00001, whereas the setting rate of learning and training is 0.01.
The forecasting model of the neural network will get the output value
of the relative error, the comparison diagram of experimental and
predictive values, the variation curves of learning training errors,
and the simulation results.

Electromagnetic parameters of the
dielectric constant of the real and imaginary parts of fine coal were
predicted and analyzed by using back propagation (BP) neural network
prediction model. Figure 9 is the neural network model to predict the complex permittivity
of the real and imaginary parts of the output of the relative error.
The relative error of the real part of the complex dielectric constant
is controlled at (−0.01, 0.01) in the training quantity of
400. The training error is in the acceptable range, which indicates
that the model is effective (Figure 9a). When the training quantity of the imaginary part
of the complex dielectric constant is 1500, the relative error is
controlled at (−0.02, 0.02). The training error is in the acceptable
range, which indicates that the model is effective. The training effect
of the prediction model is better than that of the real part learning
and training. The goal of the study is to reach 0.00001, which can
meet the requirements of learning and training. The BP neural network
model of the real part of the complex permittivity appears after 681
training. An error of 0.00012 is reached, which is different from
the desired value of 0.00001. However, the obtained errors are small
enough. The forecast error of the network model is relatively small,
which can meet the requirements of learning and training. The relative
error appeared to have a larger value due to the number of samples
of learning training.

Figure 9 Prediction of relative error of the real part and imaginary
part
of complex permittivity by neural network model.

After the neural network is well trained, the feasibility
of neural
network prediction and analysis system is needed. The predicted values
obtained from test samples and neural network were compared and analyzed.
In Figure 10, the
symbol “o” and the symbol “+” coincide
together, which shows the feasibility of the neural network system.
The prediction effect of the real part of the complex dielectric constant
is better than that of the imaginary part of the complex permittivity.

Figure 10 Comparison
of complex permittivity and predictive value of neural
network.

Figure 11a shows
that the real part of the complex dielectric constant having a value
of R = 1 can explain the fact that the training process
has a high significance and that the training results are consistent
with the true value. For test and analysis, as shown in Figure 11b, the analysis
results show that the predicted target value is consistent with the
output value, which shows that the prediction effect of the model
can meet the requirements. Figure 11b shows that the virtual part of the complex dielectric
constant learning and training has a value of R =
0.9981, which shows that the training process has a high significance.
This also shows that the training results are consistent with the
true value and can meet the requirements of the model. The results
of the comprehensive analysis at R = 0.9982 show
that the predicted target value and the output value are basically
the same.

results.

3.5 Magnetic
Separation Desulfurization of Fine
Coal
Methods to strengthen the magnetic desulfurization by
microwave medium can be effective for desulfurization of high-sulfur
coal. In the present study, the effect of magnetic medium’s
content on the microwave medium is to strengthen the desulfurization
effect. There are more preferred forms of sulfur iron sulfide coal.

Values of the factors considered in the analysis were found as
follows: coal sample size of −0.50 mm, magnetic particle size
of 0.074–0.150 mm, and microwave pretreatment atmosphere is
in the air. Lu’an coal (LA) and Weinan coal (WN) were used
in the magnetic separator having microwave exposure time differing
from each other by 180 s. Figure 12 shows the results for rare earth magnetic roller separator
used with different contents of medium high-sulfur fine coal. Two
kinds of high-sulfur coal were used. However, the reduced amplitude
decreases with an increase of the media content, especially, for more
than 5% content, a slight increase is observed. The yield of clean
coal content in magnetic medium of 0–10% increases with the
increase of media content. However, in a smaller range of 2–5%,
the yield reduced. When the content was more than 2%, the coal yield
declined sharply.

Figure 12 Desulfurization index of high-sulfur fine coal with different
contents
of medium.

As shown in Table 2, rare earth magnetic
roller separator used with different contents
of medium high sulfur fine coal shows a good desulphurization index
when magnetic media content is 5%. The yields of clean coal from Weinan
and Lu’an coals were 41 and 38.50%, respectively. The sulfur
content in clean coal was found to have values of 3.56 and 2.41% for
Weinan and Lu’an coals, respectively. The desulfurization rate
was found to be 61.70 and 38.50% for Weinan and Lu’an coals,
respectively. Clean coal yield is very low. When the magnetic medium
content is 2%, Weinan and Luan coal yielded 92.11 and 88.2% clean
coal, respectively. The corresponding values for sulfur content in
the clean coal were 3.26 and 2.25%, respectively. The desulfurization
rate was found to have values of 23.99 and 45.78%, respectively. Comprehensive
analysis of the desulfurization indicates that for both Weinan and
Lu’an coals, the overall separation index is the best for a
medium content of 2%.

4 Conclusions
1. The strengthening
mechanism of dielectric
storage energy, dielectric energy consumption, magnetization energy
storage, and consumption of fine coal layers with different medium
contents were investigated. The content of magnetic medium was varied
by increasing the electromagnetic parameters to improve the microwave
absorption properties and effectively improve the energy utilization
rate and reduce the energy losses. The microwave pretreatment process
can effectively improve the absorption and broaden the bandwidth of
the coal sample. The process can also improve the frequency adaptive
design of coal. The content of magnetic medium is conducive to the
absorption of the microwave energy in low-frequency region.

2. On the basis of the theoretical
analysis,
a physical model for the absorption of microwave energy is proposed.
The microwave energy absorption law of fine coal during the process
of strengthening of the microwave energy absorption is revealed. Magnetic
medium has been used to improve the dynamic dielectric polarization
relaxation and the energy losses of the magnetic relaxation, whereas
the absorption of microwave energy by the magnetic particles through
heat conduction and radiation to the fine coal layer transfer energy
has also been investigated.

3. Microwave processing of fine coal absorptive
capacity mainly depends on two conditions: microwave energy penetrating
the material which depends upon the attenuation performance or the
attenuation characteristics, followed by microwave energy getting
absorbed into the sample surface to maximize access to the sample,
that is, the absorption of samples with better matching characteristics.
A neural network model for the prediction of the electromagnetic parameters
of fine coal is established by using the neural network method. The
real and imaginary parts of complex permittivity and complex permeability
are trained and predicted. The neural network model has shown satisfactory
results.

4. When the magnetic
medium content was
2% for Weinan and Lu’an coals, values for the clean coal yield
were 92.11 and 88.2%, respectively. The corresponding values for sulfur
content in clean coal were 3.26 and 2.25% for Weinan and Lu’an
coals, respectively. The desulfurization rates were 23.99 and 45.78%
for Weinan and Lu’an coals, respectively. A comprehensive analysis
shows that for separation desulfurization of Weinan and Lu’an
coal, the separation index appears to have the best values for a medium
content of 2%.
