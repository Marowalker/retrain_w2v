Newly discovered two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals
(nanosheet) of platinum diselenide (PtSe2) have progressively
attracted attention due to their expected high performance in catalysis,
sensing, electronics, and optoelectronics applications. Further extraordinary
physicochemical properties are expected if these nanosheets of platinum
diselenide can possess mesoporosity as this may enable a high range
of molecular adsorption, enhancing their functionalities in catalysis,
batteries, supercapacitors, and sensing. Here, we present for the
first time a straightforward, aqueous-phase synthetic strategy for
the preparation of scalable nanosheets of platinum diselenide with
mesoporous structure via a surfactant-templated self-assembly followed
by a thermal annealing phase-transformation process. We used hexamethylenetetramine
as a hexagonal honeycomb (sp2–sp3 orbital)
scaffold for assembling the Pt and Se organic complexes to form the
nanosheet structure, which is stable, preserving the 2D structure
and mesoporosity during a thermal annealing at 500 °C. Density
functional theory analysis then indicated that the mesoporous nanosheets
of platinum diselenide exhibit a high free-energy and large density
of π electrons crossing the Fermi level, inferring a high-catalytic
performance. This effortless strategy is currently being extended
to the synthesis of other transition metal dichalcogenides, including
the preparation of multi-metal atomic dichalcogenide nanosheets, for
a wide variety of scientific and technological applications.

1 Introduction
Two-dimensional
(2D) atomic crystals of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) compounds
have continued to be the focus of research in condensed-matter physics
and the material chemistry synthetic field due to their rich electronic
and optoelectronic properties that vary from insulator to semiconductor,
metal and superconductor, depending on their metal and chalcogen atom
pair. These features have enabled them to be actively implemented
as a key agent in a variety of applications, such as electronic and
optoelectronic devices, solar cells, sensing, batteries, and catalysis.
A large range of new physical phenomena, such as enhancement of exciton
formation and robustness,1 in-plane plasmonic
resonance and optical non-linearity,2 strong
light–matter coupling,3 as well
as ultra-fast energy-transfer at the surface,4 have also been observed from nanosheets of TMDs so far. In particular,
applications in which the surface properties play key roles, such
as in sensing, dye-solar cells, storage in batteries, supercapacitors,
and catalysis, nanosheets with mesoporosity offer high performance
due to their excellent surface accessibility and enhanced surface
interaction, bonding, and charge storage.5 This mesoporosity also allows better selectivity as well as chemical
species diffusion for efficient mass transportation, as a result of
unusual pore surface chemistry due to adjustment of the quantum confinement
effect, interlayer coupling, and symmetry elements.6 In addition, it was also demonstrated that defect introduction,
crystal twinning, etc., on the nanosheet structure effectively modified
its electronic structure and surface chemistry, leading to enhanced
performance in catalysis applications.7 Combining such peculiar electronic properties with unusual mesoporosity
in this ultimate 2D state promises a generation of materials with
novel condensed-matter physics phenomena, enhancing their performance
in existing applications.8 Here, we present
a facile chemical synthetic strategy to prepare large, scalable, mesoporous
nanosheets of platinum diselenide (PtSe2), in an aqueous-phase
reaction followed by a phase transformation using thermal annealing.
Nanosheet PtSe2 is a new family member of the 2D crystal
TMDs that has recently been discovered. With an energy gap in the
range of semiconductor to semi-metal,9,10 depending on
the number of layers, it has a high electron mobility at room-temperature,11 and is a potential candidate for high-speed
electronics applications.12 A recent theoretical
study under circular polarization conditions revealed that PtSe2 nanosheets are also a promising alternative candidate for
valleytronics applications.10 Furthermore,
the existence of the catalytically active noble metal Pt in the hexagonal
lattice of the atomic sheet leads PtSe2 to exhibit excellent
photo- and electro-catalytic and gas-sensing properties.10,12,13 Regarding this point, the synthesis
of nanosheet PtSe2 or other TMDs with mesoporous properties
has not yet been achieved experimentally. The available synthetic
methods for PtSe2 only realize mono- or polycrystalline
nanosheets.10,14 Our synthetic process is very
straightforward and is able to produce PtSe2 nanosheets
with scalable dimensions that can be realized from a simple two-step
process, namely, the growth of nanosheets of PtSe complexes from an
aqueous-phase reaction between a Pt salt and organoselenium compounds
in the presence of hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) surfactant as the
template and 2D directing agent, and a thermal annealing phase transformation.
First-principle analysis has suggested that the mesoporous PtSe2 nanosheets should possess high-catalytic performance due
to the existence of a high degree of system enthalpy. These large-scale
and mesoporous PtSe2 nanosheets show significant promise
with their novel physical and chemical properties providing high flexibility
for device fabrication or design of proof of concept devices using
mesoporous nanosheets.

2 Results
We grew the mesoporous PtSe2 nanosheets
from an aqueous-phase reaction process under a mild reaction temperature,
that is, 90 °C, followed by a thermal annealing phase transformation
in ambient N2 at 500 °C (see Methods). In a typical process, using standard reaction conditions, that
contains 0.68 mM Pt ions, 98.7 mM Se, and 22.73 mM HMT, the nanosheets
develop very quickly and can coat the entire reaction container wall
as well as the substrate surface that is in contact with the solution
within only 15 min of reaction time. By simply controlling the growth
time, few-layer mesoporous PtSe complex nanosheets can be obtained
on the reaction container wall or substrate surface. The nanosheets
of PtSe2 were obtained by transferring the PtSe complex
films onto a SiO2/Si substrate, or any solid substrate,
and annealing at 500 °C under ambient nitrogen. The as-prepared
PtSe complex film is easily exfoliated from the reaction container
surface when clean pure water is added (Figure S1a). Due to their large scale, the peeled off nanosheets are
visible in solution. Although the PtSe complex nanosheets have a lateral
dimension according to the container’s wall or substrate size,
the peeled off nanosheets can be up to several hundred micrometers
wide (Figure S1b). Nevertheless, we did
not notice any formation of dispersed nanosheets in the solution phase.
Meanwhile, the byproduct was solely Se nanoparticles (Figure S2). Typically, although Raman spectroscopy
analysis of the as-prepared sample nevertheless indicated that it
was PtSe (Figure S1c), the energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) elemental analysis signaled that the concentration ratio
between Pt and Se atoms in the nanosheet obeys PtSe2 stoichiometry,
and interestingly, they are homogeneously distributed throughout the
nanosheet (Figure S1d–g). We then
carried out high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
analysis on the sample and we found that the as-prepared nanosheets
apparently had a highly porous or perforated structure with pore diameters
in the range of 20–50 nm, making them mesoporous in character
(Figure S1h). However, the HRTEM results
did not find any lattice fringes on the nanosheet samples, inferring
that they are amorphous in nature. Such findings were further verified
by the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis results
(Figure S1i), which showed bright halos
upon exposure to the electron beam. In addition, the HRTEM data indicated
that the nanosheets are actually composed of several monolayer sheets
that are stacked instead of a solid structure.

To obtain a PtSe2 crystalline phase, we carried out a thermal annealing process
on the PtSe nanosheets deposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate
at 500 °C under ambient nitrogen for 5 h. Optical microscope
analysis results then showed that the structure and morphology of
the nanosheets was retained and no structural defects could be observed
on the nanosheet structure upon thermal annealing treatment (Figure 1a), indicating that
the nanosheets possess the crucial high thermal stability. To verify
that the PtSe2 phase was formed, we conducted Raman spectroscopy
analysis on the sample. As is widely understood, PtSe2 adopts
the CdI2 lattice that is grouped into D3d point-group symmetry and is characterized
by two active Raman modes, namely, Eg and A1g, the in-plane and out-of-plane vibration modes of the Se atoms,
respectively, and two infrared active modes, Eu and A2u. The Raman active modes are predicted to be at 180 and 210
cm–1 for the in-plane and out-of-plane vibrational
modes, respectively. Our Raman results (Figure 1b) obeyed this condition, thus proving that
the sample is pure PtSe2. As can be seen from the figure,
the Raman result shows the existence of two finely separated Raman
peaks that emerge at frequencies of approximately 178 and 210 cm–1, which are the in-plane (Eg) and out-of-plane
(A1g) modes, respectively. This is in good agreement with
the recently reported Raman analysis results for PtSe2 nanosheets.15 As can be seen from the spectrum, the intensity
of the Eg peak is much higher compared to that of the A1g peak. This result can only occur in relatively thin van
der Waal crystals where the in-plane mode surpasses the out-of-plane
mode, which indicates the nanosheet’s low thickness. As the
spectrum also reveals, another significant strong peak is additionally
noticeable at approximately 235 cm–1. This can be
related to the longitudinal optical signal from overlapping of the
in-plane (Eu) and out-of-plane (A2u) infrared
active modes.15 Meanwhile, small ripples
at frequencies of 300 and 370 cm–1 are associated
with Raman modes of the Pt–N vibration in the PtSe2 nanosheet. Thus, these findings strongly verify that nanosheets
of PtSe2 have been successfully realized in this study.
Whilst the Raman result confirms the phase purity of PtSe2 in the annealed nanosheets, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and EDX
analysis results (Figure 1c,f) both further support such phase purity and further, the
EDX analysis reveals that the elemental composition in the nanosheets
is maintained and follows the stoichiometry of PtSe2. Regarding
the XRD analysis result, a typical XRD pattern shows the presence
of a strong peak at a 2θ value of approximately 16.60°
with the full-width at half-maximum value as low as 1.9043. This peak
is consistent with the (001) Bragg plane diffraction of PtSe2, as indicated in the standard diffraction data (JCPDS file no. 88-2281)
for PtSe2. No other peaks related to the PtSe complex can
be observed in the pattern. For comparison, there are no definite
diffraction peaks in the patterns of the as-prepared samples or PtSe
complex, inferring their amorphous nature, which was also revealed
earlier by the SAED analysis (Figure S1i).

spectroscopy (XPS) spectra for the sample, the growth time was 15

To further verify that the phase of the nanosheets is PtSe2, we carried out XPS. It was found that both Pt and Se elements
can be observed in the spectrum as well as other elements from the
substrate, and the analysis data indicate that the PtSe2 phase definitely exists. For example, in the case of Pt, the high-resolution
scan of its binding energy spectrum (4f7/2) can be well-fitted
by two overlapping Gaussian–Lorentzian (GL) curves centered
at 72.52 and 72.92 eV (Figure 1g). We associate the higher intensity peak but lower in energy
peak at 72.52 eV with PtSe2 bonding in the honeycomb lattice,
which is assumed to be due to the three- or four-coordinated sp2–sp3 trigonal–planar molecular backbone
of the 2D hexagonal honeycomb crystal.16,17 The percentage
of this bonding type is approximately as high as 74.94%. The lower
intensity peak can be associated with PtOx species (72.92 eV). However, its ratio is relatively low, that is,
approximately 25.06%. A similar case was observed for Se (Figure 1h). Two peaks that
can be attributed to Se at bonding energies of 53.78 and 54.13 eV
can be observed in the fitted spectrum of Se (3d5/2). The
higher peak that is lower in energy is associated with the sp2–sp3-coordinated Se covalent bonding energy18 or PtSe2, with its percentage existence
as high as 39.57%. Meanwhile, the peak at 54.13 eV, with a percentage
as high as 60.43%, is associated with the metallic Se. Its percentage
is high because it might originate from the Se nanoparticle byproduct,
which is attached to the PtSe2 nanosheet product.

We carried out HRTEM analysis on the annealed sample to obtain its
detailed structural properties (Figure 2). As the analysis results show, the nanosheet structure,
including its mesoporosity or perforated characteristic, is maintained
during the high-temperature thermal annealing (Figure 2a,b), reflecting its high structural stability.
Further, it was also discovered that the layered nature of the nanosheet
structure is also preserved and unchanged, which indirectly confirms
its excellent thermal stability. According to the high-resolution
image, it can be seen that the nanosheet is polycrystalline in nature
with crystallites in the form of trigonal prismatic (2H) and octahedral
(1T) phases (Figure 2c). Such polycrystallinity was further confirmed by the SAED analysis
result, which presents a crystalline character with an arbitrary symmetry
diffraction pattern (Figure 2d). Beside revealing the polycrystallinity property, the SAED
result also unveils the nature of the monolayer stacking during the
growth process, which is random and un-oriented. This is reflected
by observed disorder in the Moire pattern of a typical nanosheet sample
(Figure 2e). However,
we believe that single-crystalline PtSe2 nanosheets could
be synthesized if a suitable pre- or post-growth treatment, with specific
reaction conditions (e.g., concentration and growth temperature) or
annealing process conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, etc.) are
discovered. We are in the process of finding PtSe2 nanosheets
with monocrystalline properties. Next, we carried out atomic force
microscopy (AFM) analysis to find the surface profile and the thickness
of the nanosheets (Figure 2f). It was found that the nanosheets have a thickness in the
range of 11–25 nm (Figure S2) with
an average surface roughness of as high as 12.20 nm. Nanosheets with
such low thickness provide the possibility of growing a monolayer
nanosheet of PtSe2 if suitable growth conditions are discovered.
Considering the interlayer spacing of 7.25 Å in the PtSe2 system, obtained from the first-principle study (discussed
later), each PtSe2 nanosheet should be composed of 15–35
monolayers. In addition, and in good agreement with the HRTEM analysis
results, such high surface roughness further adds additional verification
that the nanosheets are mesoporous with a large-area of potentially
active sites available for sensing and catalysis applications.

of the nanosheet used for AFM analysis.

Regarding their chemical stability, both the PtSe complex and PtSe2 nanosheets exhibit excellent stability and do not show any
significant modification in their structure and properties when they
are aged for more than 4 months. However, in the case of the PtSe
complex, during the aging process in aqueous solution, flocculation
or a decrease in the lateral size occurred due to oxidation or the
annealing process. Nevertheless, it was found that they dispersed
well and did not agglomerate with each other. Optical microscopy analysis
indicated that the aged sample still had a lateral size that was higher
than several hundreds of micrometers in edge-length. Therefore, further
analysis and application using aged samples are highly possible without
any doubt about the modification of their properties. In
other words, following the thermal annealing phase transformation,
PtSe2 nanosheets that have been stored will still have
a structure and properties that are similar to the freshly prepared
ones. At the same time, the PtSe2 nanosheets on Si or ITO
substrate also do not exhibit any modification to their structure
and properties after aging in air for more than 4 months. The optical
and electron microscopy analysis confirmed such stability as no change
in the PtSe2 nanosheet properties was observed. The results
are shown in Figure S3.

At this stage,
experimental evidence of the PtSe2 nanosheet’s performance
in applications, particularly in catalysis, has not yet been obtained.
Nevertheless, we carried out a first-principles study to obtain their
general electronic properties, and from them, their catalytic performance
was estimated. In this study, to simulate the mesoporous and polycrystalline
properties, we restacked two bilayers of PtSe2 nanosheets
by shifting the bottom bilayer plane’s origin fractional coordinates
to u = 0.5 and v = 0.75 Å relative
to the top layer plane origin. The optimized structure and the electronic
properties of the simulated polycrystalline and mesoporous (restacked)
PtSe2 nanosheets are shown in Figure 3. The lattice parameter is a = b = 3.705 Å, which was expanded by 0.24%
compared to that of the monocrystalline bilayer PtSe2 system.
The modification of the initial lattice parameter upon restacking
is normal and it is likely due to the increase in charge density wave19 in the layered system, which induces lattice
expansion. This is commonly observed in most restacked 2D layered
structures.20 In common processes, restacking
also causes an increase in the metal–metal or metal–chalcogen
bond length in the 2D lattice (Figure 3a,b). For example, the Pt–Se bond length in
single-crystalline PtSe2 is 0.256 nm but it is elongated
to 0.258 nm in the restacked system. Such a process becomes more intense
when the deviation in the stacking orientation is higher.21 It was also found that there is a distortion
in the symmetry of the hexagonal lattice upon restacking due to the
existence of a slight difference between neighboring Pt–Se
bond lengths in a single unit of the hexagonal system, that is, 0.2580
and 0.2575 nm (Figure 3b). Such distortion of the lattice structure upon restacking or due
to the polycrystalline arrangement might change the overall density
of states of the system, augmenting the surface energy of the system.
Thus, high-catalytic performance is predicted to be generated from
the nanosheets. Such an assumption agrees well with the electronic
property calculation results, as shown in Figure 3c,d. Although the electronic properties of
the restacked PtSe2 are generally similar to those of the
monocrystalline PtSe2 nanosheets, that is, metallic in
nature, restacking can modify the shape of either the band structure
or the density of states. For example, as the analysis results revealed,
there exists a high amount of electron wave confinement over a small
space in all levels of energy. Near the Fermi level, with a high-density
of π electrons from the p and d orbitals, this confinement may generate many effects, particularly
an enhancement of surface energy and system enthalpy. Our calculations
found that the enthalpy of the system remarkably increases upon being
restacked, for example, from −2476 eV in the monocrystalline
PtSe2 phase to −4593 eV in the restacked system.
This implies that the restacked PtSe2 system is chemically
active and has potential for catalysis and sensing applications. The
enthalpy would be much higher if defects due to the polycrystallinity,
polymorphism, as well as the mesoporosity, are considered, further
heightening the physicochemical properties. Hence, extraordinary performance
in catalysis applications is anticipated. We are in the process of
studying the effect of polycrystallinity and mesoporosity on the catalytic,
optical, and electrical properties of mesoporous PtSe2 nanosheets.

3 Discussion
The
formation mechanism of the PtSe2 nanosheets using the present
method is not yet understood. However, the following facts can be
considered: firstly, HMT is likely the key agent for nanosheet growth,
providing a scaffold for the sp2–sp3 hybrid
orbital-built structure. Therefore, it should be present during the
growth process and its concentration was in the range of 0.3–1.0
M for large-scale nanosheet PtSe complex formation. The thickness
of the nanosheet decreased with increasing HMT concentration, as can
be judged from the color contrast on the reaction container wall.
Due to their large dimensions, this condition caused the nanosheets
to have a tendency to be folded or rolled up, as can be ascertained
from the optical microscope images. At a relatively high-concentration,
that is, higher than 1.0 M, limited nanosheet formation was observed.
This could be due to the effect of steric hindrance of the precursor,
the result of the high-concentration of HMT. When the concentration
of HMT was below 0.1 M, limited nanosheet production was observed.
However, they were thick, not lateral in dimension, and cracked. The
dominant products at such low HMT concentrations were quasi-spherical
Se nanoparticle aggregates. The results are shown in Figures S4 and S5. Secondly, the reaction temperature should
be 90 °C. This is to maintain the dissolution of Se in the NaBH4 solution. Therefore, a lower reaction temperature is not
applicable. Similarly, owing to the process being in an aqueous phase,
the use of a reaction temperature higher than 90 °C may cause
the reaction to boil, which would impede the formation of the nanosheet
structure. Thus, we did not carry out a study of the effect of growth
temperature below or above this temperature.

We then performed
Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses on the as-prepared
PtSe complex nanosheets in order to determine the mechanism of their
formation. From the results (Figure S6),
we hypothesized that HMT with its tetrahedral cage structure may act
as an sp2–sp3 structural template22,23 in the beginning for the Pt or Se complexes via Pt–N or Se–H
bonds. For the Pt–N bonding, the Pt salt precursor that dissolves
to PtCl6–2 complexes will bind to amine
sites of the HMT molecule forming Pt–N coordination. This process
could create a negatively charged ligand on the HMT molecule structure.
Such a Pt–N bond is detected by the Raman analysis, as indicated
by the presence of two strong peaks at 303 and 358 cm–1, which are associated with Pt–N stretching and rocking vibration,
respectively.24 At the same time, the organoselenium
compound (sodium hydrogen selenide) that is produced from the reaction
of NaBH4 and Se,25 which may
be available in the form of HSe–, will bind to the HMT molecule
either via Se–H or C=Se bonds with the hydrogen or carbon
at the alkyl site of the HMT molecule, respectively, which also produces
a negatively charged ligand. The existence of Se–H and C=Se
bonds is confirmed both by the Raman and FTIR analysis results. For
example, the Se–H bond is represented by the appearance of
strong peaks at 789 and 904 cm–1 and a weak peak
at 2927 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum, and a peak at
820 cm–1 in the Raman spectrum.24 Nevertheless, in view of the FTIR peaks which are much
stronger than that in the Raman spectrum, we believe the Se–H
bond dominates the bonding between Se complexes and HMT molecules.
Considering the molecular structure and the nature of its coordination
with Pt and Se, we hypothesized that each HMT molecule should coordinate
with at least three Pt and six Se complexes at the same time to form
the PtSe2 compounds.

Whilst the coordination of Pt
and Se atoms to the HMT molecule template has been proven by the Raman
and FTIR analysis results, the formation of the nanosheet morphology
is assumed to be directed by the negatively charged ligand from the
Pt and Se complexes. This feature may control the direction of nanostructure
growth, and hence the thickness of the nanosheet. HMT, with its well-known
special properties in promoting 1D and 2D nanostructures,26−28 and containing Pt and Se complexes,
will then crystallize, probably via hydrogen bonding, as occurs in
the formations of most metal-organic framework systems,29 with a negatively charged layer resulting from
coordination of HMT with both Pt and Se complexes projecting a nanosheet
configuration (2D crystallites). We also predict that the crystallization
of HMT containing Pt and Se complexes may occur both in the solution
phase and on a solid surface. Following the oriented-attachment process,
small 2D crystallites containing Pt and Se complexes form large-scale
2D nanosheets on the solid surface. The attachment process of 2D crystallites
in solution onto the surface occurs randomly and very quickly, promoting
a mesoporous structure. The process will continue until the entire
precursor is consumed. Nevertheless, a continuous nanosheet structure
on the substrate or the reaction container is obtained from as early
as 30 min and becomes thicker over time. This process is similar to
that observed in the reaction of HMT with AgSCN producing 2D and 3D
supramolecular isomers.30 With the subsequent
thermal annealing process at 500 °C and under ambient N2, the Pt and Se complexes in the nanosheet react, producing a PtSe2 nanosheet with mesoporosity. We assumed that HMT and the
other complexes decomposed completely because of the absence or limited
presence of any complexes as indicated by the Raman and FTIR analysis
data. The mechanisms of the PtSe complex and PtSe2 nanosheet
formation are described in Figure 4.

the formation of a mesoporous PtSe2 nanosheet. (a) The
circumstance at the beginning of the reaction where the Pt and Se
complexes bind to the HMT molecules via Pt–N and Se–H
coordination. (b) The subsequent process during growth in which the
coordinated HMT with Pt and Se complexes crystallizes via “hydrogen
bonding”, forming monolayer sheet crystallites. (c) The monolayer
crystallites attach to each other randomly producing the mesoporous
PtSe complex nanosheet. (d) Annealing the PtSe complex nanosheet produces
the PtSe2 polycrystalline nanosheet.

In conclusion, large-scale, mesoporous nanosheets
of PtSe2 can be realized on a solid substrate from an aqueous-phase
solution via a surfactant template assembly and a thermal annealing
phase transformation. The nanosheet is polycrystalline in nature containing
both 1T and 2H phases of PtSe2. The nanosheets have mesopores
arising from the random oriented-attachment of 2D nanocrystallites,
promising exceptional performance for catalysis and battery applications.
The present approach is applicable to the preparation of nanosheets
of different blends of TMD. This new structure of nanosheet PtSe2 may find potential applications in currently existing applications
and may provide a new dimension of research for the scientific and
industrial applications of these materials.

3.1 Methods
3.1.1 PtSe2 2D Nanosheet Synthesis
PtSe2 nanosheets were prepared using a two-step process, that is, the
wet-chemical growth of nanosheets of PtSe complexes and a thermal
annealing phase transformation. In the first step, we prepared the
PtSe complex nanosheet via a simple aqueous-phase wet-chemical process
under a mild temperature, that is, 90 °C. In a typical procedure,
0.5 mL of 0.015 M potassium hexachloro platanate (K2PtCl6, Fluka) was mixed with 0.5 mL of 0.5 M HMT (Sigma). The solution
was shaken for 15 s to fully mix the reagents. This mixture was later
called the Pt precursor for simplicity. At the same time, 0.78 mg
of Se powder (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 10 mL of ice-cooled 0.1
M NaBH4 (Sigma). The mixture was also shaken to disperse
the Se powder well in the solution. The mixture was then transferred
into a water bath (Julabo) and the water bath temperature was then
set and fixed at 90 °C. Within 10–15 min the Se dissolved
producing a dark-brown solution. This mixture was called the Se precursor.
Under these conditions, the concentrations of K2PtCl6, HMT, and Se are 0.68, 22.73, and 98.7 mM, respectively.
We used an excess of Se concentration compared to that of Pt in order
to facilitate a facile achievement of PtSe2 stoichiometry
during the reaction. Nevertheless, the effect of Se concentration
on the structural growth of PtSe2 nanosheets was not evaluated
in this study. We did, however, examine the effect of HMT concentration
on the structural growth of PtSe2 nanosheets by using five
different HMT concentrations during the growth process, namely, 4.55,
13.63, 22.73 (standard reaction), 31.82, and 45.45 mM. Other reactants
were kept unchanged.

All chemicals were used as received without
any further purification process. Pure water (∼18 MΩ)
was used throughout the reaction, which was obtained from a Milli-Q
water purification system.

In the reaction, the main components
were the Pt precursor in the form of PtCl6– and the Se precursor in the form of NaHSe along with the HMT surfactant
template system without the presence of any reducing agent. NaHSe
is the main product that is produced from the reaction of Se powder
with NaBH4 solution, which also then breaks up into HSe–.

The PtSe complex nanosheet was grown by injecting
the Pt precursor into the hot Se precursor. The reaction container
was then tightly closed and exposure to the ambient atmosphere was
avoided. The reaction was then left undisturbed for 15 min. After
finishing the reaction, the color of the solution changed to green-brown.
Under these conditions, nanosheets of PtSe complexes were grown on
the reaction container’s wall. Meanwhile in the solution, the
main product was Se nanoparticles and these were easily separated
from the PtSe complex nanosheets by simply pouring out the solution,
leaving the PtSe complex nanosheets on the wall of the container.
To remove the Se nanoparticles from the PtSe complex nanosheets, pure
water was poured into the container and then removed gently using
a micropipette. This process was repeated at least three times. Finally,
the cleaned PtSe complex nanosheets on the container wall were preserved
in pure water by filling the container with pure water. Within 30–60
min, the PtSe complex nanosheets peeled off from the container wall
and dispersed in the solution.

To obtain the PtSe2 nanosheets, the PtSe complex nanosheets were transferred onto a
substrate (ITO or Si) by simply dropping the solution onto the substrate
surface and letting the aqueous solvent to dry at 100 °C on a
hot-plate. After that, the sample was transferred into a tube furnace
with a quartz tube chamber and annealed at 500 °C for 5 h. During
the annealing, nitrogen gas with a flow rate of 25 sccm was purged
into the quartz tube chamber. Using this process, PtSe2 nanosheets can be obtained.

3.2 Characterization
The morphology and crystallinity
of the 2D nanosheet samples were examined using a scanning TEM FEI
Tecnai G2 F20. The instrument was also equipped with an EDX apparatus
with an X-maxN 80T detector (Oxford instrument) for elemental
analysis. The SAED analysis was carried out using a Hitachi HT7700
high-contrast digital TEM apparatus with 120 kV acceleration voltage.
The sample thickness analysis was carried out using a scanning probe
microscopy CPII/ VEECO that was operated at tapping mode. The crystalline
phase of the samples was evaluated via Raman spectroscopy using a
CRM 200 Witex Raman spectrometer with 532 nm excitation lasers, XRD
spectroscopy using a Bruker D8 advance XRD spectrometer, and FTIR
spectroscopy using a PerkinElmer Spectrum 400 FTIR/FTNIR system apparatus.
The chemical state and bonding of the sample were characterized via
XPS using a KRATOS XSAM-HS apparatus with Al Kα radiation. In
the analysis, a Shirley-type background was used for the curve fitting
process with a GL mixed function background (70 and 30% for the Gaussian
and Lorentzian components, respectively) for the line shaping. The
calibration curve for the core level spectra was referenced to C 1s
with a binding energy of 285 eV.

3.3 First-Principles Study Analysis
The first-principles
density functional theory study was carried out using Materials Studio
8.0 with a generalized-gradient approximation Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
functional as implemented in Castep code.31 In the present study, the electronic properties analysis of the
mesoporous PtSe2 nanosheets was only carried out on the
2H phase. The calculation was performed on restacked nanosheets of
PtSe2 (constructed using a supercell model of 2 ×
2 × 1 containing 96 atoms that was built using the P63/mmc (194) space group with initial lattice parameters
of a = b = 3.724 Å and c = 5.031 Å) as a model for our PtSe2 sample
structure. One stacked nanosheet contained two monolayers of PtSe2. Therefore, the restacked system consisted of four monolayers
of PtSe2. Pt and Se atoms were located at Wickoff positions
2(c) and 4(f), respectively. A large value of vacuum slab (15 A) was
used during the calculation to prevent false interaction with the
periodic image. To model polycrystallinity in the restacked nanosheet,
the second layer original coordinate was shifted to u = 0.5 and v = 0.75. For geometry optimization,
Brillouin zone integration was carried out on a 9 × 9 ×
1 Monkhorst–Pack grid. Meanwhile for band structure calculation,
Brillouin zone integration was carried out on a 3 × 3 ×
1 Monkhorst–Pack grid to simulate the two-dimensionality. To
simplify the electron correlation problem, the Koelling–Harmon
relativistic effect was introduced into the geometry optimization
and energy calculation. The energy convergence was set to 0.001 eV/cell
and the maximum force on each atom was set to 0.05 eV/Å. Discrete
Fourier transform calculations were performed on Pt 5d9 6s1 and Se 4s2 4p4 with the core-electron
model based on the ultrasoft pseudopotential plane wave function.
The band energy tolerance used for both band structure and density
of states calculations was 1.0–5 eV. The electronic
properties of the nonstacked system were also simulated in this work
and were compared to the restacked system in order to obtain the change
in their properties.
