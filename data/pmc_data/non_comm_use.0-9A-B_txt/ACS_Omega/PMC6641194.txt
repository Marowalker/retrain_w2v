A biopolymer
from tragacanth gum, arabinogalactan (AG), was investigated
for its adsorption and corrosion inhibition traits for carbon steel
corrosion in 1 M HCl. Gravimetric method, potentiodynamic polarization
measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, UV–visible
spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy
were used to judge the adsorptive nature of AG in the acid solution.
The inhibition efficiency improved with an increase in AG concentration
and temperature of the acid solution. Thermodynamic and activation
parameters (ΔGads, Ea, ΔH, and ΔS) were also calculated and discussed. The adsorption of AG favored
Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The results of corrosion tests confirmed
that AG could serve as an efficient green corrosion inhibitor for
the carbon steel in 1 M HCl, yielding high efficiency and a low risk
of environmental pollution. Theoretical quantum chemical and Monte
Carlo simulation studies corroborated the experimental results.

Introduction
Carbon steel with its
relatively high strength, low cost, and widespread
availability has been extensively utilized in numerous industrial
applications such as petrochemical plants, power plants, oil and gas
refineries, distillers, and ships.1 However,
low resistance of carbon steel to acid corrosion has been the major
hurdle in its applications, and there remains a need to prolong the
lifetimes of steel items. Among the various approaches employed to
minimize steel corrosion in acidic environment, the usage of inorganic/organic
inhibitors is a well-established and cheapest method.2−5 The inhibitors can be added to water tanks, pipeline streams, and
so forth or incorporated into paint coatings, where they may form
passive or almost impermeable films on the metal surface to reduce
the rate of corrosion. Unfortunately, most of them are expensive,
toxic toward the environment, and non-biodegradable. The adversely
affecting chemicals and recent increase in environmental awareness
have geared the research activities toward the development of nontoxic,
cheap, environment-friendly, and biodegradable substances as inhibitors.
These prerequisites are fulfilled by the natural polymers that efficiently
protect metals in diverse degrading environments. Few of the natural
polymers, which have been studied as green and eco-friendly inhibitors
for carbon steel corrosion in acid solutions in the recent past, include
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC),6,7 starch,8,9 gum arabic,10−12 chitosan,13 pectin,14 and xanthan gum.15

CMC was evaluated as an inhibitor for mild steel corrosion
in H2SO4 by the hydrogen evolution method.6 At a concentration of 0.5 g/L at 30 °C,
CMC yielded an inhibition efficiency of 56.3%. In another study, sodium
carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) was evaluated for the inhibition
of mild steel corrosion in 1 M HCl solution through electrochemical
methods [electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic
polarization (PDP)]. Na-CMC was found to be 78% efficient at 298 K
at a concentration of 0.04 g/L.7 Modified
cassava starch (600 ppm) was quite efficient in inhibiting the corrosion
of carbon steel in alkaline medium, which was confirmed by the electrostatic
potential mapping of its monomeric units.8 In another study, inhibition of the mild steel corrosion in 0.1
M H2SO4 by using starch was analyzed by gravimetric
analysis and PDP technique.9 Starch inhibited
the corrosion of mild steel to a considerable extent. The maximum
efficiency was 66.21% at 30 °C at an inhibitor concentration
of 200 ppm. Its efficiency was, however, further increased on the
addition of small amount of surfactants: 1 ppm cetyl trimethylammonium
bromide and 5 ppm sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Gum acacia efficiently
inhibited the corrosion of mild steel in 0.1 M H2SO4. The efficacy of 1500 ppm gum acacia in the corrosive solution
was 83% at 30 °C.11 In another study,
the adsorption of gum arabic on mild steel and aluminum in aggressive
H2SO4 solution was investigated within the temperature
range of 30–60 °C using gravimetric as well as thermometric
techniques.12 Its efficiency elevated with
an elevation in inhibitor concentration, reaching up to 37.88% for
mild steel at 60 °C and 79.69% for aluminum at 30 °C at
0.5 g/L concentration of gum arabic.12 Chitosan
was evaluated as a corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in 0.1 M HCl
by gravimetric analysis, electrochemical analysis, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), and UV–visible (UV–vis) analysis.13 Chitosan inhibited corrosion at very low concentrations.
Inhibition efficiency initially increased with the increasing temperature
up to 96% at 60 °C and then dropped to 93% at 70 °C. Umoren
et al. used pectin as a corrosion inhibitor of X60 pipeline steel
in 0.5 M HCl solution.14 Electrochemical
analysis revealed that at 25 °C, 1000 ppm of pectin efficiently
inhibited 78.7% of the metallic corrosion. Xanthan gum was studied
as a corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in 15% HCl by Biswas et al.15 It yielded an efficiency of 86% at 298 K at
a concentration of 0.5 g/L, as observed by weight loss measurements.

Natural polymers are efficient inhibitors, yet, as generally observed,
low-to-moderate inhibition efficiency at high inhibitor concentration
is among the limiting factors attributed to their employment as corrosion
inhibitors.6,12,16 Several attempts such as synergizing with halide ions12,17 and surfactant additives,9,11 copolymerization,16 cross-linking,18 and
composite formation19 have been made toward
improvement in their protection capabilities. Mobin and Rizvi in years
2016 and 2017 have carried out elaborate research studies on natural
polymers such as xanthan gum, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and psyllium
polysaccharide.20−22 At a concentration of 1000 ppm, xanthan gum synergized
by surfactant SDS was 82% efficient and was observed to be physisorbed
on carbon steel in 1 M HCl.20 Hydroxyethyl
cellulose synergized by surfactant Triton X-100 exhibited the highest
efficiency of 91.62% for the corrosion of carbon steel in 1 M HCl.21 A novel polysaccharide from Plantago having a complex polymeric structure of arabinoxylans was found
to be effective inhibitors of carbon steel corrosion (94.2% efficient
at 1000 ppm) and exhibited a comprehensive or mixed type of adsorption,
that is, both physisorption (electrostatic) and chemisorption (molecular).22 With numerous functional groups (−OH)
and a heteroatom (O) in their molecular structure, these natural polymers
inhibit corrosion either by adsorbing electrostatically to the carbon
steel surface or by forming coordinate type of linkage by sharing
a lone pair of electrons with the partially filled Fe orbital. The
synergistic effect of the surfactants on the inhibition offered by
these natural polymers has been observed to occur because of some
polymer/surfactant interactions in the acidic medium. The ionic surfactant
that is bound to these polymers has charged groups, which may repel
one another and could cause expansion in the polymer backbone. This
expansion in polymer molecules causes it to occupy even larger surface
area on its adsorption on the carbon steel surface and offers better
protection against an aggressive medium.20,21

Tragacanth gum is the dried exudates derived from branches
and
stems of middle eastern species of the plant Astragalus and possesses a long history of application as a viscosity-boosting
agent and stabilizer in food emulsions. It is allowed for edible usage
in European and North American nations (E-number E413). The biopolymer
“arabinogalactan (AG)” present in it presents intriguing
prospects for corrosion inhibition because of its safe use, inexpensiveness,
and availability. AG is complex, hydrophilic, and heterogeneous and
a highly branched anionic polysaccharide composed of l-arabinose, d-galactose, d-xylose, l-rhamnose, d-glucose, l-fucose, and d-galacturonic acid.23 Upon solubilization in water, the gum is usually
divided as a soluble “tragacanthin” fraction and an
insoluble “bassorin” fraction. The water-soluble tragacanthin
fraction resembled pectin containing linear chains of galacturonic
acid and fuco-xylogalacturonans, whereas bassorin is mainly constituted
by xylo- and fuco-xylo-substituted polysaccharides.24 The AG isolated from tragacanth gum is water-soluble and
produces low-viscosity solutions.25 There
are many research articles on the polysaccharides as corrosion inhibitors
of metals in aggressive solutions like the ones discussed above, but
no published facts are known on AG as an inhibitor for A1020 c-steel
corrosion in 1 M HCl. In the current work, AG has been selected as
an environment-friendly corrosion inhibitor for steel in 1 M HCl.
The main constituents of AG have numerous hydroxyl groups (−OH)
and heteroatom O. AG macromolecule, with its large size, number of
reactive groups, and abundant unshared lone pairs of electrons from
O, is expected to get adsorbed over a wide area on the carbon steel
surface and retard the rates of corrosion at low concentrations.

The aim of this evaluation is to assess the improvement of corrosion
resistance of A1020 carbon steel by AG in 1 M HCl using gravimetric,
electrochemical, and surface analyses to clarify its inhibition mechanism.
Electron density distributions in the AG molecule and its reactivity
indices obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations
were reported. Adsorption of the AG molecule on carbon steel (represented
by Fe(110)) was modeled with the Monte Carlo simulation approach.
The structure of the biopolymer AG molecule is shown in Figure S1
(Supporting Information).

Results and Discussion
NMR Analysis
of the Isolated Polysaccharide
Isolated
polysaccharide gave a main C-1 α-Araf signal
at δ 112.8, with nonprominent ones at δ 110.9, 111.4,
111.9, 112.9, and 114.2 (Figure 1). The signals at δ 102.9 and δ 101.3 arise
from the main chain of (1–4)-linked α-Galp A units, confirming its complex structure.

Figure 1 NMR spectrum of the isolated
polysaccharide.

Figure 1 depicts
the NMR spectra of AG with signals similar to those given in previous
research studies.26 The 13C
NMR revealed that the polysaccharide under investigation was one derived
from tragacanth, a complex AG with many sequences containing Araf units, mostly with the configuration by virtue of strongly
negative specific rotation.

FTIR Analysis of Isolated Polysaccharide
Figure 2 depicts
the characteristic
peaks of polysaccharide AG. An intense broad band at 3403.19 cm–1 suggests asymmetric stretching of a number of hydroxyl
groups in AG. Asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the various CH
bonds is represented by the adsorption band at 2927 cm–1. Symmetric stretching of the CH group can be affirmed by an absorption
band at 2373 cm–1. CH deformations are defined by
a band at 1376 cm–1. The mid-infrared range at 1300–1000
cm–1 consists of (C–O–C) glycosidic
bond vibration and stretching vibrations of (C–OH) side groups.
Polygalacturonic acids have absorption band maxima in this region,
with absorptions at 1072.86 cm–1, unveiling the
availability of a galactose-consisting polysaccharide such as AG.27

Gravimetric Measurements
Enlisted in Table 1 are the corrosion values obtained
by gravimetric measurements that prove AG to be an efficacious inhibitor
of carbon steel degradation in 1 M HCl solution at temperatures between
30 and 60 °C. With an increasing AG concentration and the test
solution temperature, the inhibition efficiency increases; the maximum
inhibition efficiency of 96.30% is observed at 60 °C at an AG
concentration of 500 ppm. Table 2 quantitatively compares the performance of AG with
those of other polysaccharides studied previously.20−22

Evaluation
of Table 2 revealed
that AG performs much better at low concentrations, compared
to previously studied polysaccharides. AG molecules adsorb on the
carbon steel surface and construct a barrier for the transfer of mass
and charge as the inhibitor concentration increases. This further
leads to the inhibition of the attack of the aggressive 1 M HCl on
the carbon steel surface. The degree of protection against the acid
attack is directly related to the area over the surface masked by
the adsorption of AG. The number of the adsorbed AG molecules increases
on the surface with the increasing AG concentration, resulting in
better protection. The surface coverage parameter, θ, defines
the fraction of carbon steel surface area covered by the AG molecules
adsorbed. The surface coverage values can be calculated using the
following equation 1  where
the corrosion rate in the acid solution
without AG is CR0 and the corrosion rate in the acid solution
with AG is CRi.

Inspecting Table 1, an inference is
derived that the surface coverage increases with
the increasing AG concentration. AG inhibits carbon steel corrosion
at all temperatures evaluated. The chemical mode of adsorption of
AG on the carbon steel surface in 1 M HCl solution is confirmed by
the observation that the inhibition efficiency increases with the
increasing temperature of the test solution. As the test solution
temperature increases, desorption of H2O from the metal
surface is more favorable, leading to an increase in adsorption of
AG molecules upon availability of larger surface area.22

Adsorption Isotherm
Surface coverage
(θ) values
obtained from the gravimetric experiments at different temperatures
were fitted to the model of various adsorption isotherms, and the
most accurate fit was obtained for Langmuir adsorption isotherm, delineated
by the following equation 2  where C is the concentration
of AG and Kads is the adsorptive equilibrium
constant. The plot C/θ versus C (Figure 3) gives
a straight line with a slope near to unity. The linear regressions
between C/θ and C at various
temperatures were obtained, and the corresponding parameters are given
in Table S1 (Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Langmuir
isotherms for the adsorption of AG in 1 M HCl at various
temperatures.

The values of the slope
as well as the linear correlation coefficients
(R2) were close to unity, which indicates
that AG adsorption on the carbon steel surface can be interpreted
by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The adsorptive equilibrium constant
“Kads”, relative to standard
adsorption free energy “ΔGads”, is given in eq 3. 3  where C depicts the water
concentration in solution. The unit of C lies in
that of Kads. As observed in Table S1
(Supporting Information), the unit of Kads is L/g. This suggests that the unit of C is g/L with the value of 1.0 × 103 approximately
.21,28 The values of ΔGads obtained up to −20 kJ mol–1, generally,
are indicative of the electrostatic interaction between the charged
metal and a charged inhibitor molecule, that is, physisorption, whereas
those more lesser than −40 kJ mol–1 suggest
the formation of coordinate bond through sharing or relocation of
charge from AG molecules to the metal surface, which implies chemisorption.
The results presented in Table S1 (Supporting Information) suggest that the values of ΔGads are negative for all investigations. The negative
values of ΔGads also imply spontaneous
adsorption of AG on the carbon steel surface. The ΔGads values between −40 and −20 kJ mol–1 are an indicative that the AG molecules are adsorbed
on the metal surface via mixed adsorption (both physisorption and
chemisorption), which is predominantly chemical in nature.20

Thermodynamic and Kinetic Parameters
Activation energy
of the process of adsorption of AG on the surface of carbon steel
is given in Table S2 (Supporting Information). The corrosion reaction may be assumed as an Arrhenius-type process.
Apparent activation corrosion energy “Ea” and Arrhenius pre-exponential factor “A”, exclusive and inclusive of AG, can be calculated
by the following expression 4  where T is the absolute temperature
and R is the universal gas constant. The values of Ea and A in 1 M HCl solutions
(uninhibited and inhibited by AG) were obtained by the linear regression
of log CR versus 1/T data depicted in Figure S2 and
Table S2 (Supporting Information).

The linear regression coefficient is near unity; therefore, carbon
steel corrosion in aggressive test solution can be elucidated by the
kinetic model to a reasonable degree of certainty. Ea values decreased lower than those of the uninhibited
solution on the addition of AG to 1 M HCl solution. The adsorption
of AG on the carbon steel surface appreciably improved with the increase
in temperature, which caused a decrease in Ea. The carbon steel surface is in lesser contact with 1 M HCl
because of this adsorption of the AG molecules at higher temperatures,
leading to lower corrosion rates. Consequently, as the temperature
increases, an increase in inhibition efficiency combined with a smaller Ea for the corrosion rate with the addition of
AG indicates a specific interaction between the carbon steel surface
and AG, leading to AG–Fe2+ complex formation. The
decreasing corrosion rates with the increasing temperature in the
inhibited test solution are explained by the variation in the values
of pre-exponential factor, A. On increasing the AG
concentration, the apparent activation energy was reduced. The reduction
in the values of Ea and A caused an increase in the corrosion rate of the carbon steel. However,
with an increase in AG concentration, these values were significantly
reduced. A reduction in the values of A and Ea resulted in the decrease of corrosion rates
of steel.29

An alternative form of
the Arrhenius equation given in eq 5 can be used to calculate
the values of ΔS (entropy of activation) and
ΔH (enthalpy of activation). 5  where h is Planck’s
constant and N is Avogadro’s number. Figure
S3 (Supporting Information) depicts a plot
of log (CR/T) versus 1/T, which
results in straight lines with a slope of ΔH/R and an intercept of ln (R/Nh + ΔS/R). The
values of ΔS and ΔH are
calculated and are given in Table S3 (Supporting Information). ΔH bears a positive sign
indicating endothermic and slow dissolution of the carbon steel.30 Lower the value of ΔH, lesser is the energy barrier for the reaction. In electrolytic
solutions for a chemical reaction, the values of Ea and ΔH should ideally be equal.
In all cases, there exists almost a very small and constant alteration
between both values, as recorded in Table S2 (Supporting Information). Table S2 (Supporting Information) enlists the large values of the entropy of activation
ΔS, which carry a negative sign. The negative
values of ΔS are suggestive that the activated
complex of the rate-determining step is an association rather than
a dissociation; hence, a decrease in disordering takes place proceeding
from reactants to the activated complex. Fe–H2O,
the activated complex in the blank solution, gives Fe2+, H2, and OH– during corrosion on decomposition.
In inhibited test solutions, Fe–H2O is replaced
by the Fe–AG complex. The adsorption of AG in aqueous solution
of 1 M HCl can be accounted as a quasi-substitution process amidst
H2O on the electrode surface and the organic compound in
the aqueous phase. With this condition, the adsorption of AG is followed
by the desorption of H2O from the surface. The thermodynamic
values obtained are the algebraic sum of the adsorption of AG molecules
and the desorption of water molecules. Therefore, the decrease in
ΔS is linked to the decrease in ΔS of the solvent and increase in adsorption of AG onto the
carbon steel surface.31,32 The Fe–AG complex is more
ordered than Fe–H2O33 as the entropy decreases on increasing the concentration of the
inhibitor.

Electrochemical Measurements
PDP Measurements
Investigating the mechanism and the
kinetics of cathodic and anodic reactions, potentiodynamic measurements
were performed. Figure 4a shows the polarization curves for carbon steel in 1 M HCl, with
the addition and exclusion of different concentrations of AG. The
polarization parameters deduced are recorded in Table S2 (Supporting Information).

Figure 4 (a) PDP curves and (b)
Nyquist and (c) Bode plots for the carbon
steel sample immersed in 1 M HCl in the absence and presence of various
concentrations of AG.

On adding AG to 1 M HCl, Ecorr values
become more positive and shift anodically compared to those of the
blank. Observing the magnitude of the change observed in the Ecorr values, we can say that AG is a mixed-type
inhibitor, predominantly anodic in nature, that is, presence of AG
inhibited oxidation of Fe and to a lower extent hydrogen evolution.
A progressive decrease in the value of icorr was observed as the AG concentration was increased, suggesting a
retarded rate of electrochemical reaction, as a barrier was created
between steel and corrosive solution by a protective AG film on the
carbon steel surface. The variation in the values of βc and βa in 1 M HCl having AG indicates that both
the cathodic hydrogen evolution and anodic metal dissolution processes
are inhibited. An increase in the polarization resistance (Rp) occurs on the addition of AG. The increasing
values of Rp with the increasing AG concentration
indicate efficient corrosion inhibition by AG. At an AG concentration
of 500 ppm, the highest value of inhibition efficiency was observed
(96.7%). The inhibition efficiencies calculated by polarization measurements
exhibit a trend parallel to that of gravimetric measurements.34

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
EIS evaluated
the corrosion inhibition in the presence and absence of various concentrations
of AG. The impedance data for low carbon steel in 1 M HCl solution
exclusive and inclusive of AG obtained at 30 °C are enlisted
in Table 3.

The semicircle fitting method determined the electrochemical impedance
parameters.35 Nova 1.11 software was used
to obtain a semicircle fit through data points in the Nyquist plot.
The Nyquist plots for the carbon steel surface inhibited by AG comprised
a depressed semicircle with a high-frequency capacitive loop (Figure 4b). Because of the
dispersion effect and the state of the electrode surface,36 which are characteristic impedance properties
of carbon steel electrodes in the process of corrosion, a diversion
from a perfect semicircle to a depressed semicircle in the center
under the real axis was observed, which was primarily caused by heterogeneity
and roughness of the electrode surface and also by the current distribution
displaying a geometrical behavior. The impedance response changed
considerably after the addition of AG to the 1 M HCl solution. Shapes
of the plots remained the same for the electrodes with and without
various concentrations of AG, indicating an unaltered mechanism of
corrosion on the addition of AG.7

Nova 1.11 software (Metrohm Corporation) measured and simulated
the electrochemical impedance spectra at the carbon steel/1 M HCl
interface with and without AG by fitting various impedance profiles
into an equivalent circuit, which is given in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). This equivalent circuit
is composed of constant phase element, CPE, solution resistance, Rs, and charge-transfer resistance, Rct. The system investigated here can be characterized
by distributed capacitance for a nonhomogenous corroding surface of
carbon steel in 1 M HCl. This phenomenon of depression modeled by
CPE is usually associated with the frequency dispersion, dislocations,
surface roughness, formation of porous layers, and distribution of
the active sites. The distributed capacitance is given by constant
phase element (CPE, Y0). The impedance
of CPE is given as 6  Here, “ω” is the angular
frequency, “j2 = −1” is an imaginary
number, “Y0” is the magnitude
of CPE, and “n” is the CPE exponent.
When n = −1, CPE is an inductor and a pure
capacitor when n = 1. The values of Cdl were calculated at a frequency at which the imaginary
component of the impedance is a maximum 7  

Table 3 clearly
indicates that the values of Rct increased
and those of Cdl decreased with increased
AG concentration. Increase in the thickness of the double layer and/or
decrease in the dielectric constant cause a decrease in the Cdl value. An inhibitive layer on the electrode
surface controlled the dissolution extent by displacing H2O and other ions that were initially adsorbed at the steel/solution
interface. The Fe–H2O complex that developed on
the steel surface in the presence of uninhibited 1 M HCl changes to
the Fe–AG complex, which formed on the addition of AG to the
acid solution.

Because of AG adsorption on the active sites
of the carbon steel
surface, surface heterogeneity reduces and the value of “n” gets closer to unity. At a concentration of 500
ppm, AG becomes 98.1% efficient. Ideally, the χ2 values
lie between 10–3 and 10–5.37 In the current study, the χ2 values for AG adsorption are within 10–3. The
impedance measurements resulted in inhibition efficiencies quite similar
to those of the gravimetric and PDP studies.

The inhibitory
effect of the compound may be judged by phase angle
at high frequencies in phase angle versus frequency diagrams, which
are given in the Bode plots in Figure 4c. Addition of AG renders a higher protection with
higher values of absolute impedance at low frequencies.38 In theta versus frequency diagram (Figure 4c), a more negative
phase angle means higher capacitive behavior. This capacitive response
increased with an increasing AG concentration, indicating more inhibitive
behavior at higher concentrations. The formation of a protective layer
on the electrode surface causes the phase angle (α°) to
reach toward almost −90° in the presence of AG. The value
of phase angle (α°) for 1 M HCl was −46.2°,
which approaches −75.1° on the addition of 500 ppm AG,
as shown in Table 3. Ideally, a linear relationship between log |Z|
against log f, with a phase angle of −90°
and a slope near −1, may be seen in the intermediate frequency
region.39 The analyses of linear relationship
between log |Z| versus log f give
a slope value between −1.42 and −1.81.

Surface
Morphological Studies
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
AFM
quantitatively analyzed
the surface properties of the polished and immersed carbon steel coupons
in 1 M HCl for 6 h in the presence and absence of AG (Figure 5). The AFM image of a freshly
abraded carbon steel specimen in Figure 5a displays a sufficiently smooth surface.
Another AFM image of a severely corroded surface of carbon steel immersed
in a test solution for 6 h at 30 °C is shown in Figure 5b. The image in Figure 5c shows a surface even and
smooth in the presence of 500 ppm AG comparative to the image obtained
for coupon immersed in uninhibited solution. The polished carbon steel
surface before immersion in aggressive 1 M HCl solution exhibited
an average roughness of 71.4 nm. A quite high roughness of 781 nm
was observed on the carbon steel surface immersed in 1 M HCl without
AG [Figure 5b]. For
the steel specimen immersed in the test solution of 1 M HCl having
500 ppm AG, there is very less corrosion damage present on the surface
depicted by small spikes, as seen in Figure 5c, and an average roughness of 77.7 nm is
obtained, which indicated the adsorption of a microscopically thin
film of AG preventing the attack of a corrosive acid solution.40

Figure 5 Three-dimensional AFM and SEM/energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) images
of carbon steel before and after immersion in the test solution for
6 h at 30 °C: (a,d,g) as polished before immersion; (b,e,h) uninhibited
solution; and (c,f,i) inhibited solution (500 ppm AG).

SEM/EDX
Surface morphological studies
of the carbon
steel specimen immersed in uninhibited and inhibited acid solutions
at 30 °C were conducted by SEM. Figure 5d depicts a freshly polished carbon steel
surface, quite free of notable deformity except the polishing marks.
The SEM image of the carbon steel surface after 6 h of immersion in
1 M HCl shows a severely corroded surface. The surface uniformly corroded
because of the strong corrosive attack of 1 M HCl [Figure 5e]. Figure 5f presents an SEM image in the presence of
500 ppm of AG where the surface heterogeneity decreased, showing clearly
a smooth and comparably even surface. These findings further lead
to suggest the gradual adsorption of AG on the carbon steel surface.41

To find out the elements present on the
carbon steel surface before and after immersion in an acid solution
(uninhibited and inhibited), the steel samples were subjected to EDX,
and the results are shown in Figure 5. The EDX spectrum of the polished carbon steel surface
before immersion in acid solution shows the characteristic peaks of
elements present in the carbon steel [Figure 5g]. The EDX spectrum of the carbon steel
specimen after immersion in acid solution exhibits the additional
peaks of Cl [Figure 5h], which is attributed to the free corrosion of carbon steel in
1 M HCl solution. In the presence of AG, an additional peak of O (due
to O atoms from the inhibitor) is present, but the peak of Cl is absent
(Figure 5i). This is
attributed to the inhibition of acid corrosion by an adsorption film
containing O covering the carbon steel surface. Further, in the presence
of an inhibitor, enhanced signals of C and Fe are observed relative
to those of uninhibited solution. The enhancement in the intensity
of C signals is because of the C atoms of the adsorbed inhibitor,
whereas the enhancement of Fe peaks points to the protection of the
carbon steel surface by adsorbed AG.42,43

FTIR
To establish the adsorption of AG on the surface
of carbon steel and detect the functional groups involved in the corrosion
inhibition process, FTIR analysis was performed. The FTIR spectrum
of pure AG was compared with the spectrum obtained for the scrapped
sample from the carbon steel surface (Fe2+–AG),
as shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information).

Both the IR spectra represent the characteristic peaks of
AG with variations in molecular vibrations.44 Studying the spectrum of the scrapped sample, the shifts of the
molecular vibrations observed through variations in wavenumbers may
suggest the formation of the complex between AG and Fe2+ on the carbon steel surface. Comparing it with the IR spectrum of
pure AG, it is observed that major shift in the peaks representing
−OH stretching vibrations (from 3351.32 to 3403.19 cm–1) is quite prominent, suggesting that −OH groups are primarily
responsible for the adsorption process. The unshifted or slightly
shifted peaks observed in the spectrum of the scrapped sample might
be due to negligible action of the representative groups in the adsorption
process.

UV–Vis Spectroscopic Analysis
Formation of a
complex between Fe and AG in 1 M HCl solution can be described by
a variation in the position of the absorption maximum or a variation
in the value of absorbance22 (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The spectrum of the
inhibited test solution without immersion of carbon steel coupon showed
two absorption bands at 220 and 334 nm, with the corresponding values
of absorbance that are 0.86 and 0.60, respectively (spectrum1), whereas
the spectrum of the inhibited test solution after carbon steel immersion
displayed the previous absorption bands shifted to 231 and 336 nm,
with much different values of absorbance that are 3.72 and 0.84, respectively.
This change in wavelength or absorbance values suggests the formation
of the AG–Fe2+ complex in the solution.

Quantum Chemical Calculations and Monte Carlo Simulations
Gas-phase optimized geometry of the AG molecule, graphical images
of electron density distributions in its molecular orbital [highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO)], and electrophilic and nucleophilic Fukui indices
are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Optimized structure (a); HOMO (b) and LUMO (c) electron density;
and (d) f– and f+ (e) Fukui indices electron density isosurfaces for AG.

The HOMO lobes are located on
the pyran ring with larger fractions
on the O atoms of the −OH and −OCH3 groups.
The LUMO comprises a large lobe that is centered on a hydroxymethylene
group on one of the pyran rings. These observations suggest that the
molecule is liable to interact with metallic orbitals using mainly
the centers with O atoms. The HOMO and LUMO surfaces and contours
for AG suggest a nonuniform distribution of electron density around
the molecule, indicating that the AG molecule is nonsymmetric and
the molecule may not exhibit uniform reactivity on all pyran rings.

The f– further confirms that
the centers for electrophilic attacks on the AG molecule are essentially
the O atoms with σ-characteristic orbitals. The f+ also corroborates the observation from the LUMO contour
surface, showing the hydroxymethylene group with superior disposition
toward the nucleophilic attack. Selected quantum chemical parameters
of the molecule are shown in Table 4.

The ELUMO is slightly high, which suppresses
the possibility of back-bonding in interactions of the AG molecule
with steel. The large dipole moment (6.955 debye) of the AG molecule
might favor dipole–dipole interactions with the polarized steel
surface.45 Equilibrium configuration of
the adsorption of AG on the Fe(110) plane surface is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 (a) Top and (b) side
views of the model structures simulating the
adsorption of AG on the Fe(110) surface.

The orientation of the AG molecule on Fe(110) reflects favorable
interactions between the atoms in the AG molecule and Fe. The large
adsorption energy (−902.349 kJ/mol) recorded for the interactions
supports the assumption that the AG molecule adsorbs effectively on
the Fe surface and might inform its high corrosion inhibition potential.

Conclusions
i AG efficiently inhibits the corrosion
of carbon steel coupon in 1 M HCl solution. The inhibition efficiency
is both concentration- and temperature-reliant and reaches as high
as 96.3%.

ii High values
of Cdl (double layer capacitance) in the
inhibited acid solution,
with an accompanying increase in Rct (charge-transfer
resistance) with respect to those of the blank solution, indicate
the accumulation of a protective AG layer at the metal/solution interface.

iii The Tafel plots suggest
that AG acts
as a mixed-type inhibitor for carbon steel in 1 M HCl solution with
a predominantly anodic effect.

iv Adsorption of AG on the carbon steel
surface followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Observing the high
value of the adsorption equilibrium constant, it is evident that AG
is strongly adsorbed on the carbon steel surface.

v Formation of an adsorbed protective
layer due to the binding of inhibitor with the carbon steel surface
was assured by FTIR results.

vi The interactions of AG with Fe2+ to form a complex in
1 M HCl solution were confirmed by
UV–vis spectroscopic measurements.

vii AFM and SEM/EDX micrographs revealed
that the inhomogeneity of the carbon steel surface was considerably
homogenized by AG, giving a clear evidence of its adsorption on the
carbon steel surface and the high protection it offers in 1 M HCl
solution.

viii The evaluation
resulted that the
adsorption of AG molecules on the carbon steel surface in the test
solution is a comprehensive type of adsorption, although predominantly
chemical in nature. The adsorption occurs by the electrostatic interaction
of AG with the positively charged carbon steel surface as well as
via the lone pair interaction.

ix Theoretical quantum chemical and Monte
Carlo simulation studies provided corroborative explanation to the
observed inhibitive performance of AG.



Experimental
Methods
Isolation of Polysaccharide
Tragacanth gum was obtained
from Sigma, India. After stirring the gum for 3 h in distilled water,
the mixture was successively filtered through a fine mesh strainer
to remove insoluble macroscopic debris. To precipitate the soluble
polysaccharide, AG, from the tragacanth gum, the filtered mixture
was added in excess of ethanol in the ethanol/water ratio of 7:3.46 The separated polysaccharide was vigorously
stirred in absolute acetone, dried in oven, powdered, and stored in
desiccators over anhydrous chloride. The isolated polysaccharide was
characterized by NMR and FTIR.

The polysaccharide powder was
dissolved in D2O (99.9%) for NMR investigation. The 13C NMR spectra of test samples were recorded by a Bruker AV
III HD (TXI) 500 NMR spectrometer. The PerkinElmer spectrophotometer,
“Spectrum Two”, with a resolution 0.5 cm–1 recorded the FTIR spectra of samples. The KBr disk method was used,
and the spectra within the frequency of 4000–500 cm–1 were recorded.

Specimen Preparation
The corrosion
tests were executed
on coupons obtained from A1020 c-steel chemically composed of C (0.0684%),
Mn (0.0394%), S (0.0008%), P (0.0219%), Cr (0.0456%), Mo (0.0674%),
Al (0.0154%), V (0.0335%), and remaining weight % of Fe. Chemical
constitution of A1020 carbon steel was measured by a spark optical
emission spectrometer. Rectangular coupons (2.5 × 2 × 0.1
cm3 and surface area: 10.9 cm2) were employed
for gravimetric analysis. Circular coupons with 1.0 cm2 exposed surface area and thickness of 0.1 cm were utilized for electrochemical
analysis. The coupons were abraded by emery papers of various grades,
initially rinsed with acetone, and later, rinsed with deionized water.
The test coupons were finally dried at room temperature before performing
corrosion tests on them.

Electrolytic Solution
ACS reagent
grade 37% HCl was
diluted with double-distilled water to prepare an electrolytic solution
of 1 M HCl. The concentration of AG in 1 M HCl solution was varied
between 100 and 500 ppm. The electrolytic volume used in gravimetric
and electrochemical measurements was 200 mL and 1 L, respectively.

Gravimetric Measurements
The freshly abraded coupons
of carbon steel were completely immersed in 1 M HCl for 6 h. The test
solutions contained different concentrations of AG at temperatures
30, 40, 50, and 60 °C. The carbon steel coupons were thoroughly
rinsed by deionized water, and a bristled brush was used to gently
scrub these coupons to eliminate the corrosion products. They were
again washed properly with deionized water and acetone. The test coupons
were finally dried to obtain a constant weight. The gravimetric measurements
were conducted on triplicate coupons to ascertain the reproducibility
of results, and the average corrosion rate was computed. Corrosion
rate calculation in “mg cm–2 h–1” was done using the following equation 8  where ΔW is the weight
loss (mg), t is the exposure time (h), and A is the area of the specimen (cm2). The inhibition
efficiency (%), represented by “η”, was obtained
using the values of the average corrosion rate as follows 9  where CR0 and CRi were the corrosion rates in free and acid solutions inhibited
by AG, respectively.

Electrochemical Measurements
The
electrochemical measurements
were executed on an Autolab 128N potentiostat/galvanostat. A three-neck
corrosion cell from Autolab (a capacity of 1 L) that includes the
test coupon of a vulnerable surface area of 1 cm2, embedded
in a specimen holder as the working electrode (WE), Ag/AgCl electrode
(saturated KCl) as the reference electrode, and a platinum foil as
the counter electrode was used during the experiments. Before starting
the electrochemical measurements, the WE was stationed in the test
solution. The rest potential was ceaselessly observed until it reached
a steady-state potential. Approximately an hour of immersion was sufficient
enough to stabilize the potential and achieve a steady-state open-circuit
potential (OCP). All experiments were conducted under aerated, unstirred
conditions at room temperature (30 ± 1 °C). The PDP method
recorded the polarization curves from −250 to +250 mV according
to the steady-state OCP at a scan rate of 0.00166 V/s. The corrosion
current density (icorr), anodic Tafel
slope (βa), cathodic Tafel slope (βc), and corrosion potential (Ecorr) were
obtained. Cathodic and anodic Tafel polarization curves were investigated
using Nova 1.11 software. The measured values of icorr helped in the calculation of inhibition efficiency
η (%) as per the following relationship 10  where icorr and icorr0 represent the corrosion current densities
in the presence and absence
of AG, respectively. Frequency spectrum from 10–2 to 104 Hz and ac signals of 10 mV amplitude were employed
to conduct the impedance measurements. Nova 1.11 software assisted
in obtaining and analyzing the impedance parameters. The % inhibition efficiency “η” was obtained using
charge-transfer resistance (Rct) in the
impedance data of the Nyquist plots. 11  Here, Rct and Rct0 were the charge-transfer
resistance values inclusive and exclusive
of AG, respectively.

Surface Analysis
To visually assess
the corrosion extent
on the carbon steel specimens (in terms of heterogeneity of the surface/roughness)
immersed in uninhibited and inhibited 1 M HCl solutions, the surface
evaluation was performed by AFM and SEM/EDX analyses. These studies
were conducted on test specimens obtained from gravimetric experiments
inclusive and exclusive of optimum AG concentrations at 30 °C.
An SEM/EDX study was conducted using a JEOL JSM-6510LV scanning electron
microscope with EDX (model: INCA, Oxford). The instrument incorporated
to conduct AFM of uninhibited and inhibited carbon steel specimens
was “Dimension Icon ScanAsyst” having a spring constant
of 42 N m–1 and a tip radius of 10 nm. A scan rate
of 0.4 Hz was used for studying an area of 50 × 50 μm2 of test coupon in the tapping mode. The data obtained were
analyzed by NanoScope V software.

FTIR Studies of AGs Adsorbed
on Carbon Steel
FTIR spectrum
of AG adsorbed on the surface of carbon steel was recorded and compared
with that of pure AG. The AG powder was mixed with KBr and shaped
into a disk, which was subjected to evaluation to acquire the spectra
of pure AG. The second spectrum was recorded for the adsorption layer
that was formed on the test coupon after its immersion in 1 M HCl
solution having 500 ppm of AG for 6 h. The second specimen was cleaned,
dried, then rubbed with some KBr powder, and shaped into the form
of a disk. The collected data were interpreted by the Spectrum Software.

UV–Vis Spectroscopic Analysis
UV–vis
spectra were recorded for 1 M HCl solution having maximum AG concentration
before and after immersion of coupon for 6 h at 30 °C to confirm
the interaction of AG with Fe2+. A PerkinElmer Lambda 25
spectrophotometer attached with a WinLab data processor and viewer
recorded the spectra.

Quantum Chemical and Monte Carlo Simulation
Studies
Density functional theory (DFT) derived the electron
density distributions
and important quantum chemical parameters of the AG molecule. The
generally accepted molecular unit of AG (as found in PubChem) was
used as the representative molecular structure for all computational
studies. The B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) model achieved the gas-phase optimized
geometry of the molecule. Gaussian 09 software suite performed the
calculations.47 The LUMO energy (ELUMO), the HOMO energy (EHOMO), and dipole moment were recorded. The energy gap (ΔE), global hardness (η), and global electronegativity
(χ) of the molecule were calculated using the appropriate relations43 12   13   14  Electrophilic (f+) and nucleophilic (f–) Fukui
indices of the molecules were estimated using the Mulliken atomic
charge differences based on the relations48 15   16  Electron
density distributions of the Fukui
functions were visualized using the Multiwfn software.49,50

The interaction between AG and the Fe(110) plane surface was
carried out using Monte Carlo simulations. In this simulation, the
adsorption detector code executed in the Materials Studio 8.0 software
from BIOVIA-Accelrys Inc., USA, was adopted. For the simulation of
all molecules and systems, condensed-phase optimized molecular potentials
for atomistic simulation studies, “COMPASS”, force field
was utilized. The simulation of the corrosion inhibitor molecule on
the Fe(110) surface was conducted to locate the low-energy adsorption
sites of AG on the Fe surface.
