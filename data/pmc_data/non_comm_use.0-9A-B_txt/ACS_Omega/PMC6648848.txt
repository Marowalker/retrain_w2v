An efficient multienzyme system for
the preparative synthesis of d-xylonate, a chemical with
versatile industrial applications,
is described. The multienzyme system is based on d-xylose
oxidation catalyzed by the xylose dehydrogenase from Calulobacter crescentus and the use of catalytic
amounts of NAD+. The cofactor is regenerated in situ by
coupling the reduction of acetaldehyde into ethanol catalyzed by alcohol
dehydrogenase from Clostridium kluyveri. Excellent conversions (>95%) were obtained in a process that
allows
easy product isolation by simple evaporation of the volatile buffer
and byproducts.

Introduction
In recent years, increasing
energy costs and environmental concerns
have led to increased awareness about plant biomass waste being a
valuable feedstock for biorefining processes that give rise to platform
chemicals.1 Carbohydrates account for 75
wt % of the plant biomass and can be harvested from a wide variety
of biomass wastes and crops.2 The first
platform chemicals in the biorefinery can be sugars composed of different
five- and six-carbon monosaccharides.3 Glucose
is the most widely used monosaccharide, which at present is industrially
produced by the enzymatic hydrolysis of corn.4 On the other hand, sugar acids are useful chemical intermediates
usually derived from the oxidation of common aldoses. The most well-known
sugar acid is d-gluconate, and up to 87 000 tons of
it are produced annually worldwide.5 The
increased demand for plant biomass feedstock has resulted in competition
with food, higher prices, questionable land-use practices, and environmental
concerns associated with their production.6 Therefore, numerous research efforts have focused on developing
novel bioprocesses based on non-food renewable feedstock like hemicelluloses.7 A major plant hemicellulose of interest is xylan,
a branched plant polysaccharide built of β-1,4-linked d-xylopyranosyl (Xylp) residues. In this sense, d-xylonate
could serve as a substitute for d-gluconic acid with the
advantage that d-xylose is a non-food sugar. d-Xylonate
has found applications as a cement dispersant,8 for decreasing acrylamide contained in the food after cooking,9 in the production of co-polyamides,10 and as a precursor for 1,2,4-butanetriol synthesis.11,12 Recently, d-xylonic acid has also been used as a catalyst
in a three-component reaction for the synthesis of pyrrole and xanthene
derivatives with potential pharmaceutical properties.13

Conversion of d-xylose into d-xylonic
acid can
be achieved by chemical or biological methods.14 In biological systems, the enzyme responsible for the oxidation
is d-xylose dehydrogenase (d-XDH), which converts d-xylose to d-xylonolactone. This reaction is followed
by the hydrolysis of xylonolactone to xylonic acid, either spontaneously
or catalyzed by a lactonase enzyme (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 (a) Reaction Catalyzed by Xylose Dehydrogenase
(XylB); (b) Equilibrium
between d-Xylonolactone and d-Xylonate
The most commonly used method
for the production of d-xylonic
acid from d-xylose is microbial fermentation.15 Many of the examples use genetically modified
microorganisms. Thus, the metabolic d-xylose pathway has
been modified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis with the d-XDH from Hypocrea jecorina to
produce and accumulate d-xylonate.16,17 The same strategy was carried out employing the d-XDH from Caulobacter crescentus (XylB). As this enzyme is
more efficient for d-xylose oxidation, the production of d-xylonate was greatly improved in the organisms modified with
this gene.18−21 Further improvements of d-xylonate production have been
accomplished by addition of the lactonase XylC also from C. crescentus.22,23

The use of isolated
enzymes can reduce some of the problems associated
with whole-cell catalysts, such as the diffusion limitations or the
isolation and purification of final products. The first attempt within
this strategy was the use of commercial glucose oxidase for the synthesis
of d-xylonate.24 However, the
reaction requires a large amount of enzyme due to its low selectivity
for d-xylose and the addition of catalase to decompose the
hydrogen peroxide formed as a byproduct. In this way, the use of the
XylB isolated from C. crescentus has
been recently explored as a promising method to obtain d-xylonate.
This enzyme was employed in an artificial four-enzyme complex, which
allowed the formation of d-xylonate from hemicelluloses at
a micromolar scale.25 This work proved that
the XylB enzyme could be a good candidate for the preparative synthesis
of d-xylonate.

Recently, we have reported the overexpression
in Escherichia coli of the XylB from C. crescentus NA 1000 and its isolation.26 The purified recombinant enzyme showed a strong
preference for d-xylose against other assayed mono- and disaccharides
as well as strong stability when stored as a freeze-dried powder with
a half-life of at least 250 days both at 4 °C and at room temperature.
In addition, more than 80% of the initial activity of the rehydrated
freeze-dried enzyme remained after 150 days of incubation at 4 °C.
Considering these features, XylB is an excellent candidate for large-scale
biocatalytic methods. For this reason, we decided to study the synthetic
potential of this d-xylose dehydrogenase for the preparative
synthesis of d-xylonate in a direct and simple way, as outlined
in Scheme 2. A major
drawback of this approach for large-scale production is that the enzyme
requires an expensive cofactor, NAD+. To make practical
and cheap the preparative enzymatic synthesis of d-xylonate,
the development of a cofactor-regenerating system was explored.

Scheme 2 d-Xylose Dehydrogenase (XylB)-Catalyzed Synthesis of d-Xylonate with in Situ Regeneration of NAD+ Catalyzed
by Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) from C. kluyveri
For the in situ regeneration
of NAD+, we employed an
orthogonal cascade composed of the recombinant XylB from C. crescentus for xylose oxidation and the alcohol
dehydrogenase (ADH) from Clostridium kluyveri for NAD+ recycling by the reduction of acetaldehyde to
ethanol (Scheme 2).
Here, we report our results on the synthesis of d-xylonate
by XylB-catalyzed oxidation of d-xylose.

Results and Discussion
The reactions were performed in NH4HCO3 buffer
(10 mM, pH 8.0). The d-xylonic acid formed during the oxidation
was continuously neutralized with NaOH, and the pH of the medium was
maintained constant during the reaction. The conversion rate in the
enzymatic reaction is defined as the amount of d-xylose that
is oxidized under the given reaction conditions per unit of time.
The amount of substrate conversion to product was measured using a
variant of the XylB activity assay, as described in the Experimental Section. This method has been previously optimized
and described by us.26 The percentage of
conversion was calculated with respect to the initial amount of d-xylose, considering the limiting substrates in the optimization
reactions. The efficiency of the enzymatic reactions was evaluated
through their substrate conversion rates: elevated conversion rates
indicate that the amount of accumulated product per unit of time is
higher in a given reaction. Thus, the efficiency of different reaction
conditions could be quantified and compared.

The incubation
of d-xylose (33 mM) with XylB (6 U), acetaldehyde
(16 mol equiv), and alcohol dehydrogenase (35 U) in 3 mL of buffer
proceeded with complete conversion (entry 1, Table 1).

Table 1 Optimization of the d-Xylose/CH3CHO Ratio and NAD+ Concentration

6	1:3	0.83	99	
7	1:3	0.33	99	
8	1:3	0.16	98	
The system efficiency was so high that the d-xylose/CH3CHO ratio could be reduced from 1:16 to 1:1.5
without significant
loss in the percentage of conversion (entries 1–4, Table 1). The ratios 1:3
and 1:1.5 were chosen as optimal since the conversion was nearly quantitative.
Interestingly, the NAD+ concentration needed to feed the
system could be reduced to 0.16 mM, just 2 times the KM value of recombinant XylB for NAD+,25 which corresponds to only 2% mol equiv (entry
8, Table 1). The high
efficiency of the NAD+ recycling system, which works properly
even when very low concentrations of the cofactor were employed to
feed the system, is remarkable.

The synthesis of d-xylonate
was optimized with respect
to the xylose concentration (Table 2). Complete conversion was achieved at 33, 66, and
100 mM although longer reaction times were required in a concentration-dependent
manner. At 130 mM, the transformation was not complete after 19 h,
probably because some enzyme inactivation took place.

a Reactions
were carried out in 3
mL of NH4HCO3 buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0) containing
ADH (35 U), NAD+ (0.33 mM), and acetaldehyde (3 equiv with
respect to d-xylose).

b Cell-free extract (CFE) containing
overexpressed xylose dehydrogenase was used as the catalyst.

It is especially remarkable that
the d-xylose oxidation
was also highly effective using a cell-free extract (CFE) from the
recombinant strain of E. coli, which
contains the overexpressed xylose dehydrogenase (entries 5–8, Table 2). Thus, similar results
with both enzyme preparations were obtained at 33 and 100 mM xylose
concentrations. At the highest concentration, 250 mM, with additional
enzyme and a long reaction time also, the conversion was excellent
(entry 8, Table 2).
The decrease of the reaction rate and the final conversion at 130
mM substrate (entry 4, Table 2) could be due to the accumulation of ethanol in the reaction
media. In fact, the enzyme XylB seems to be very sensitive to the
presence of high concentrations of ethanol (see Experimental
Section).

We found that pH control is critical to avoid
the formation of
byproducts, particularly when the reactions were carried out at concentrations
above 100 mM. In these cases, the appearance of new signals at 3–5
ppm in the NMR spectra, which cannot be assigned to d-xylonate,
were observed. The high-resolution mass spectra of the reaction mixtures
contained the ion at m/z 313.08
(Figure S3) which is compatible with the
chemical structure of a dixylonate monoester (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Chemical Structure of Dixylonate Monoester,
which Derives from the
Ring-Opening Reaction between a Molecule of d-Xylonolactone
and a Hydroxyl of Xylonate
This compound must derive from the ring-opening reaction
between
xylonolactone and a hydroxyl of xylonate. Its formation was ascribed
to a deficient basification during the progress of the reaction, thus
leaving a high proportion of xylonolactone without being hydrolyzed
and susceptible to being attacked by a hydroxyl nucleophile of another
molecule, an intermolecular reaction that is favored at the highest
concentrations. Considering these observations, the reactions were
performed strictly maintaining the pH at 8.0. Under these conditions,
the formation of byproducts was avoided and the reactions afforded
pure d-xylonate.

Regarding the large-scale synthesis
of d-xylonate, this
approach has two important advantages: (i) it involves a volatile
buffer, and both the substrate and the product of the ADH-catalyzed
reaction can be removed by evaporation, and (ii) the use of CFE containing
XylB makes unnecessary the expensive purification of the enzyme. Optimization
of the large-scale synthesis was carried out in three reactions where
different amounts of d-xylose and CFE with overexpressed
XylB were employed (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Optimization of the scaled-up reactions: (●), 0.25 mM d-xylose and 400 U of XylB; (○), 0.25 mM d-xylose
and 610 U of XylB; (▼), 0.22 mM d-xylose and 610 U
of XylB.

When 0.25 mM of d-xylose
was used, reactions were not
totally completed after 5 h of incubation: the highest achieved conversion
of the substrate was 96%, even when XylB was increased from 400 to
610 U. However, a small decrease in the d-xylose concentration
from 0.25 to 0.22 mM resulted in a quantitative oxidation after 3
h (Figure 1).

We carried out a gram-scale preparation of d-xylonate
under these optimized reaction conditions. Since we obtained a total
conversion of the substrate d-xylose (Figure S4), we decided to increase the scale of the reaction
to 10 g. Also, at this scale, the conversion of d-xylose
to d-xylonate was practically quantitative. After the filtration
of proteins and evaporation of the solvents, d-xylonate was
obtained in pure form as indicated by its 1H NMR spectrum
(Figure 2). Therefore,
the present two-enzyme system allowed us to quantitatively obtain d-xylonate without the need of purification and using catalytic
amounts of NAD+.

Figure 2 1H NMR spectrum of the concentrated
reaction mixture
containing d-xylose (10 g, 220 mM), NAD+ (0.33
mM), acetaldehyde (330 mM), CFE containing overexpressed XylB (6500
U), and ADH (3600 U) in NH4HCO3 buffer (10 mM,
pH 8.0).

The concentration of xylose in
the reaction was 33.3 g/L, which
is similar to, or even higher than, that described in some fermentative
processes.18 It is true that this substrate
concentration is far from that of the most efficient fermentative
methods (ref (18),
160–190 g/L), but the reaction time considerably decreases
in the biocatalytical process: 2 h of reaction is enough to carry
out a near quantitative reaction. Therefore, the conversion rate was
much higher than that of any fermentative process described in the
literature to date: 15.66 g/(L h). This is more than 6 times better
than that of the best of fermentation processes.18

Successive evaporations with water and ethanol were
carried out
to eliminate all of the solvents present in the sample and derive
an accurate yield value of the xylonate obtained. However, a single
evaporation would be enough to obtain a wet but still very pure xylonate,
which could contain some ammonium salt. We would like to highlight
that this is the first multigram synthesis of xylonate, where the
final yield is calculated as the mass of the pure product and not
on basis of xylose conversion in the fermentation process. In addition,
fermentation processes usually quantify both intra- and extracellular
accumulated xylonate.

Conclusions
In this work, we present
a biocatalytic cascade for producing d-xylonate based on
the use of xylose dehydrogenase from Caulobacter crescentus and an efficient cofactor
regeneration method employing the enzyme ADH from Clostridium
kluyveri. One important advantage of this system is
that the buffer and both the substrate and the product of the ADH-catalyzed
reaction are volatile, allowing, after complete conversion, an easy
work-up and isolation of the product. In addition, the use of CFE
containing XylB makes unnecessary the expensive purification of the
enzyme. This process has been easily scaled up to 10 gram-size reactions.
We believe that this biocatalytic procedure provides a new path to d-xylonic acid production, competitive with the fermentative
processes currently used. The optimized methodology for oxidation
and cofactor regeneration presented in this work could also be applied
to the synthesis of different aldonic sugars, if XylB were replaced
by other dehydrogenases with alternative substrate specificities and
scopes.

Experimental Section
General Information
Xylose dehydrogenase
from C. crescentus NA 1000 (XylB) was
produced in our
lab as previously described.26 Alcohol
dehydrogenase from C. kluyveri was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals were purchased from
commercial sources as reagent grade. IR spectra were obtained in FT-IR
Spectrum One. The frequency of absorption maximums (ν) is expressed
in cm–1 and the samples were analyzed in a KBr tablet.
UV spectra were acquired on Molecular Devices Spectramax PLUS 384.
High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on an Agilent 6520
Accurate Mass Q-TOF spectrometer with an ESI source. 1H
and 13C NMR spectra, using D2O as the solvent,
were recorded on a Varian System 500 spectrometer equipped with a
5 mm HCN cold probe with field z-gradient, operating at 500.13 and
125.76 MHz for 1H and 13C, respectively. The
sample temperature was maintained constant at 298 K.

Enzyme Activity
Assays
XylB enzyme activity was monitored
by spectrophotometric measurement of the NADH formed from cofactor
reduction. Variations of absorbance at 340 nm are proportional to
the d-xylose concentration consumed in the reaction (εNADH = 6220 cm–1 M–1).
Reaction mixtures of 1 mL contained NaH2PO4 (50
mM, pH 8.0), NAD+ (0.5 μmol), d-xylose (5
μmol), and the enzyme sample (0.2–0.5 μg protein).
Activity assays were performed at 25 °C. One unit (U) of XylB
activity was defined as the amount that produces 1 μmol of d-xylonolactone per minute under the above conditions.

Tracking
of the Reaction Progress
The amount of d-xylose
consumed in the reaction was followed by the enzymatic
quantification assay described above, with slight modifications. Aliquots
of 20 μL from the reaction mixture were collected over time
and quenched with 7% HClO4 (1:5 v/v) and 10% NaOH (1:5
v/v). Detection of d-xylose was performed in 1 mL reactions
containing NaH2PO4 buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0), NAD+ (0.5 μmol, 0.5 mM), XylB (0.45 U, 15 μg of protein),
and a quenched aliquot (between 1 and 2.5 μL). Variation of
absorbance at 340 nm (ΔAbs340nm) before and after
XylB addition was used to calculate the final d-xylose concentration
(Figure S1).

Optimization of the d-Xylonate Synthesis
Small-scale
reactions for optimization of the synthesis parameters were carried
out in 3 mL of NH4HCO3 buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0)
containing the enzymes XylB (6 U) and ADH (35 U) and different final
concentrations and ratios of the reagents d-xylose, NAD+, and CH3CHO. Initially, the effects of four different d-xylose/CH3CHO ratios (1:16, 1:5, 1:3, and 1:1.5)
on the reaction efficiencies was assessed (Table 1). The effect of decreasing the cofactor
concentration was examined in five reactions carried out at different
NAD+ concentrations (2.3, 1.1, 0.83, 0.33, and 0.16 mM)
using a d-xylose/CH3CHO ratio of 1:3 (0.33 and
0.99 mM, respectively) (Table 1). The optimization of the final d-xylose concentration
was tested in five reactions conducted at increasing concentrations
of this substrate (33, 66, 100, 130, and 250 mM) and 3 equiv of CH3CHO, employing a NAD+ concentration of 0.33 mM
(Table 2). The biotransformation
using CFE as the source of the XylB enzyme was examined by a repetition
of two of the d-xylose optimization reactions (carried out
with 33 and 66 mM), but employing CFE instead of pure XylB, to compare
the obtained results (Table 2). In addition, two larger-scale reactions were carried out
under similar conditions using both CFE containing XylB and pure enzyme
(Figure S2). Finally, the optimal d-xylose/XylB ratio in reactions employing CFE as the catalyst was
studied in four reactions with increasing amounts of d-xylose
(33, 66, 100, and 250 mM) and XylB (6, 6, 13, and 27 U, respectively)
(Table 2). A more detailed
description of the procedures used in every optimization step can
be found in the Supporting Information.

Scale up of the synthesis of d-Xylonate to 10 g
The optimized preparative reaction was carried out in 300 mL of NH4HCO3 buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0) containing 10 g of d-xylose (66.6 mmol, 220 mM), 1.5 equiv of CH3CHO
(100 mmol, 330 mM), 40 mL of CFE with overexpressed XylB (162.5 U/mL;
total activity 6500 U), alcohol dehydrogenase (12 mg; 3600 U), and
NAD+ (100 μmol, 0.33 mM). The reaction was initiated
by the addition of NAD+. The pH of the reaction mixture
was continuously adjusted to 8.0 by the addition of a concentrated
solution of NaOH (8 M) and maintained until no progressive acidification
was observed. The protein present in the reaction mixture was precipitated
by the addition of ethanol (300 mL, 1 vol) and removed by centrifugation
(9000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C). The supernatant
was transferred to a 500 mL round-bottom flask and completely evaporated
(rotary evaporator). To ensure that all of the volatile compounds
were removed, successive additions and evaporations of Milli-Q water
(four times, 30 mL each) were performed. The residue was suspended
in 5 mL of Milli-Q water and filtered to eliminate residues of the
precipitated protein (filter Whatman 0.2 μm, Milipore). The
filtrate was freeze-dried to obtain d-xylonate as a hygroscopic
white foam (16.150 g). The product obtained was dissolved in hot EtOH
(50 mL), and later the solvent was removed under reduced pressure
(three times). Additionally, the product was dried at 50 °C under
reduced pressure over 5 h to obtain d-xylonate as a yellowish
solid (11.710 g). The amount of d-xylonate obtained corresponds
to a yield of 94%, considering that the sodium salt of the acid coordinated
with 0.45 water molecules (see below the elemental analysis). [α]D: +15.0° (c 1.0, water). IR (KBr): 3420, 2936, 1606,
