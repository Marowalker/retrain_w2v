Considering the fundamental
and most desirable characteristics
of energetic materials, a series of 1,2,3-triazole-based heterocyclic
energetic motifs nicely tuned with nitrato (−ONO2) functionality were synthesized by a microwave-assisted environmental
friendly synthetic approach with good yields. Thermal stability and
the nature of evolved gases on decomposition of structurally characterized
energetic motifs were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis and Fourier transform
infrared coupled with TGA–DSC. The explosiveness of these motifs
was explored by calculation of enthalpy of formation and density employing
density functional theory, and the detonation performances (detonation
pressure and velocity) were explored using EXPLO5_V6.03. All of these
compounds were calculated to have better oxygen balance (−36
to −52%) as compared to that of trinitrotoluene (−74%).
Most of the nitrate ester derivatives were found to exhibit low impact
sensitivities, high densities, good thermal stabilities, and promising
detonation properties, and PN3 was observed to be a superior candidate in terms of its energetic
characteristics. Hence, the experimental and theoretical outcomes
strongly reflect that the present approach of developing dendritic
high energetic materials bearing green explosive characteristics might
be a potential pathway for designing and synthesizing green explosives
with desired characteristics.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Energetic
materials (explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics)
are used for a variety of military purposes and industrial applications
such as cutting labor costs, speeding up strenuous processes in mining,
tunneling, construction, and agriculture, and thus making a tangible
input to the world economy.1 Recently,
high energetic materials have gained a lead position in the framework
of material science. Therefore, applied and fundamental aspects of
current research have been focused on the development of high energetic
materials with desirable characteristics such as high thermal stability,
impact insensitivity, high energy and density, high enthalpy of formation,
and most importantly, minimal environmental impact, which should be
considered intensely.2−7 To fulfill such characteristic demands of energetic materials, complete
combustion of the carbon backbone and the generation of N2 as an end product on explosion are highly desirable. Hence, high
nitrogen content and recommended oxygen balance are the key concerns
in designing high energetic materials. As the nitrogen rich motifs
fulfill standards like ecofriendliness and high heat of formation
with exothermic combustion,8,9 heterocycle-based energetic
materials have gained immense attention from the advanced material
and chemical research community.10 In this
context, triazole, tetrazole, and triazine have been synthesized and
studied in recent years as a fascinating class of heterocyclic cores.11,12 Further, the introduction of functionalities like nitro (−NO2), nitrate (−ONO2) ester, nitramine (NH–NO2), and nitromine (=NNO2) has enhanced the
energetic properties of these compounds.13,14 Although, the presence of nitro functionality decreases the heat
of formation, it leads to an enhancement in oxygen balance, which
enables oxidation of all nonoxidizing components of motifs to their
respective oxides and hence increases their energetic performance
(detonation pressure and velocity).15 Moreover,
the salts of above mentioned heterocyclic cores with ammonia, hydrazine,
guanidine, nitrate, perchlorate, and picrate have the advantage of
low vapor pressure over nonionic motifs, which eliminates the risk
of exposure on inhalation, provides a high heat of formation, and
high thermal stability, and interestingly, these desirable traits
can be tuned via the choice of counter ions.16,17 Although a lot of azole-based salts and polynitro compounds have
been developed that are comparable to the well-known energetic materials
such as research department explosive (RDX), trinitrotoluene (TNT),
4,10-dinitro-2,6,8,12-tetraoxa-4,10-diazatetracyclo[5.5.0.05,9.03,11]-dodecane, and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane, unfortunately,
these are highly environmental hazardous as the release of these explosives
to the environment leads to the contamination of surface and ground
water, soils, and sediments.18,19 Therefore, more efforts
are still needed to design and synthesize green explosives with tremendous
energetic parameters such as high enthalpy of formation, stability,
low impact sensitivity, and high detonation performance.20−23

Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of
triazole-based
heterocyclic energetic motifs functionalized with nitrate ester as
a new class of green energetic materials. As shown in Scheme 1, the molecular complexity
was incorporated from a small molecular framework leading to dendritic
structures by increasing the number of peripheral nitrate groups as
well as triazole moieties to ensure the fundamental requisites of
an energetic motif. The triazole ring was inserted as the core moiety
as it not only provides the thermal stability but also couples with
low impact and shock sensitivity,24 whereas
nitrato functionality was incorporated to enhance the oxygen balance
as well as the density of the motifs. A microwave-assisted approach
was developed to synthesize the precursors of polynitrate esters with
excellent yields and purity. Next, the molecular integrity and structural
analysis of the newly synthesized compounds were examined using various
spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single crystal
X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) analysis. Furthermore, thermal properties
were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), and computational studies were done using
the program package Gaussian 09.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
In
general, the copper catalyzed (3 + 2) cycloaddition reaction between
electron rich azides (dipoles) and electron deficient alkynes (dipolarophiles)
in the presence of a protic solvent is the most common synthesis strategy
for preparing 1,2,3-triazoles with high regioselectivity. But, the
development of green and industrially companionable synthetic methodologies
for the production of the triazole skeleton in small molecular entities
has been an emerging area of curiosity for synthetic chemists in recent
decades. In this context, herein, we describe the microwave-assisted
safe synthesis of precursor azides and polyhydroxy 1,2,3-triazoles
with excellent yield (>95%) and purity (Scheme 1). The azides were synthesized from the commercially
available corresponding halides with NaN3 using H2O, DMF, and acetonitrile/water mixtures as solvents under microwave
irradiation (Scheme 1). Polyhydroxy triazoles were synthesized by heating butyne-1,4-diol
and the azides in a closed vessel at 90 °C and 45 W under solvent-free
conditions. Triazoles 1a and 1a′ were
purified by column chromatography using 10% MeOH/DCM as dense yellow
oils, whereas 2a, 3a, and 4a were obtained as pure white solids by triturating the viscous reaction
mixture with methanol. Further, the series of polyhydroxy triazoles
were easily converted into their corresponding nitrate ester derivatives
using a mixture of lithium nitrate, trifluoroacetic anhydride, and
Na2CO3 as a base in dry acetonitrile at room
temperature for 6–7 h. Nitrate esters PN2 and PN3 were
obtained as greenish liquids after purification. On the other hand, PN4, PN5, and PN6 were obtained
as pure white solids on recrystallization with ethanol. The NMR spectra
were recorded in CDCl3 for compounds PN2 and PN3, whereas dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 was used as solvent for compounds PN4, PN5, and PN6.

1H and 13C
spectra of compounds PN4, PN5, and PN6 were supported by heteronuclear single quantum coherence
(HSQC) spectra as well as 13C attached proton test (APT).

2.2 X-ray Crystallography
A single crystal
of PN4 suitable for X-ray diffraction
was grown in a DCM/methanol solvent system at room temperature by
slow evaporation. As depicted in Table S1, compound PN4 crystallized
in the monoclinic crystal system (space group I2/a), with cell volume 1841.3 Å3 and 1.67
g cm–3 calculated density. The thermal ellipsoid
plot and packing diagram indicated the unambiguously determined molecular
structure, as shown in Figure 1. In the triazole ring, N–N bond lengths are 1.34 and
1.30 Å for N1–N2 and N2–N3, respectively. Oxygen–nitrogen bond
lengths for nitrate groups vary from 1.10 to 1.54 Å; O1–N4, N4–O2, N4–O2,O7–N5A,
N5A–O8, and N5A–O9 bond lengths are 1.40, 1.19, 1.19, 1.10, 1.54, and 1.12 Å,
respectively. Also, the bond distances between C3–N3 (1.36) and C2–N1 (1.35) lie
within the normal range of C–N bond lengths. Whereas, the bond
angles N1–N2–N3, N2–N1–C2, N2–N3–C3, O8–N5A–O9, and O2–N4–O3 are 107.79, 110.61, 108.63, 97.92, and 113.11°, respectively.
In PN4, very weak hydrogen bond (H-bond) interactions
were observed as the length of the H-bond was found to be 3.4 Å.
Also, no H-bonding interactions with bond length 2.5–2.9 Å
were observed. All selected crystallographic data and parameters of
the compound are detailed in Table S1.

2.3 Physical
and Energetic Properties
Heat of formation is one of the
most important properties of energetic
compounds, and it reflects their inherent energy as well as nitrogen
content. As is evident from Table 1, most of the motifs were found to exhibit positive
gaseous heats of formation (36–96 kJ mol–1) except PN2 and PN5. The condensed heats of formation (ΔHc) for motifs PN4–PN6 were 2.42,
−110.25, and 23.23 kJ mol–1, respectively.
The considerable enthalpy of formation clearly reflected their high
nitrogen richness and the presence of more nitrato groups (see Table 1). The calculated
densities of these energetic motifs range between 1.39 and 1.73 g
cm–3, as shown in Table 1. The densities of the motifs PN3, PN4, and PN5 were 1.73, 1.71, and
1.66 g cm–3, whereas PN2 and PN6 were found to
be less dense (1.44 and 1.39 g cm–3, as shown in Table 1). Because density
is a function of the packing parameter of the molecular framework,
the aforementioned values of density clearly reflect that PN3, PN4, and PN5 have a highly compact
molecular framework as compared to that of PN2 and PN6.

The impact sensitivity plays an important role in scaling up promising
energetic materials, generally expressed in the form of H50, i.e., the height from which a hammer of standard weight
falling upon the explosive will lead to a 50% probability of detonation.
The H50 values were calculated for the
corresponding energetic compounds (see Table 1) employing eq 1, as suggested by Cao.25 1  QNO2 is the net Mulliken charge
on the nitro group (NO2) and
OB100 is the oxygen balance of an energetic motif. As tabulated
in Table S1, the characteristic QNO2 and OB100 values of
the present energetic motifs were calculated using the reported method.25 Because H50 is the
direct function of the square of the net Mulliken charge on the nitro
group (QNO2), the superior H50 of PN5 over the other
motifs can be attributed to its high QNO2. Moreover, as illustrated in Table 1, all of the motifs were found to have lower
impact sensitivities as compared to those of RDX (28 cm) and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine
(32 cm), which again supported their promising energetic candidature.

After evaluation of the heats of formation and densities, the detonation
performance of the motifs in terms of detonation pressure (P, GPa) and detonation velocity (Vd, km s–1) was calculated using gaseous heat
of formation for EXPLO5_V6.03. Their detonation velocities and pressures
lie in the range 6.89–7.95 km s–1 and 17.30–26.27
GPa, respectively. Energetic motifs PN3, PN4, and PN5 exhibited high detonation pressures (26.27,
25.16, and 24.36 GPa) as well as detonation velocities (7.95, 7.80,
and 7.68 km s–1). Hence, the detonation performance
of the present compounds clearly established that owing the promising
energetic nature, this class of materials could find wide applications
in the defense sector.

Oxygen balance, the most requisite property
of an ecocompatible
energetic motif to ensure complete conversion of the energetic backbone
leading to the evolution of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, i.e., smokeless
explosion, was calculated using the chemical formula CaHbNcOd as  (values are
reported in Table 1). The oxygen balance of these
energetic compounds was found to be in an acceptable range from −36
to −52%, which is much better than TNT (−74%). The incorporation
of nitrate groups not only improved their oxygen balance but also
made them capable and potent energetic motifs with high heats of formation
and detonation performance.

2.4 TGA–DSC Coupled
with FT-IR
Further, thermogravimetric analysis and differential
scanning calorimetric
experiments were conducted to examine the thermal stability of these
compounds. Their corresponding onset decomposition temperatures (120–155
°C) are shown in Table 1 and Figure S1. From the TGA and
DSC thermal curves, it appears that the liquid products follow a three-step
decomposition pattern, whereas the solid compounds follow a two-step
decomposition process. The rate of mass loss in the first step for
the solid compounds and the second step for the liquid products was
quite high, indicating their energetic nature. It is also notable
that the motifs PN3–PN6 decomposed exothermally by releasing
1447, 912, 999, and 758 J g–1 as heats of decomposition.
To gain an in-depth understanding of the decomposition pathway and
products of these energetic motifs, IR spectroscopic analysis was
also carried out using a TGA–DSC coupled with FT-IR technique.
The IR spectra peaks at 3730, 3593, and 2304 cm–1 clearly indicated the evolution of water and carbon dioxide as major
decomposition products, whereas the peaks at 1509 and 1590 cm–1 indicated the formation of N2O and NO
as other decomposition products (see Figure 2). Although the evolution of N2 cannot be detected by FT-IR because it does not have a net dipole
moment, the possibility of its evolution cannot be neglected.26 Hence, the aforementioned findings clearly reflect
the oxygen richness and ecofriendliness of these newly developed energetic
motifs.

2.5 HOMO–LUMO Calculation
HOMO–LUMO
gaps (ΔE) were calculated to understand the
stability of these energetic motifs. As evidenced from Figure 3, the HOMOs and LUMOs are localized
over the triazole moieties and nitrato (ONO2) groups, respectively.
The ΔE values as tabulated in Table 1 correspond to satisfactory
thermal stabilities of these compounds.

molecular orbitals (LUMO).

3 Conclusions
In summary, a user-friendly
microwave-assisted synthetic approach
was developed for laboratory-scale synthesis of precursor azides and
polyhydroxy triazoles for the synthesis of polynitrate esters as a
new class of green energetic motifs. The newly synthesized compounds
were structurally characterized by employing various spectroscopic
techniques. Thermal behavior was evaluated using TGA–DSC coupled
with FT-IR to evaluate the nature of gas release on thermal decomposition.
Most of the motifs decomposed in the range of 140–155 °C,
which indicated the moderate thermal stability of these new energetic
materials. However, all of the motifs exhibited a low impact sensitivity,
high density, moderate thermal stability, and good oxygen balance
(−36 to −52%) except PN3, which displayed better thermal properties and detonation
performance (P = 26.27 GPa and Vd = 7.95 km s–1). Hence, on the basis
of comparative studies of their predicted physicochemical properties
and performances, it was concluded that the motifs presented in this
study not only display satisfactory energetic parameters, but also
address the mandatory concept of ecofriendliness.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Safety Precautions
As sodium azide
and its derivatives are highly sensitive to mechanical stimuli and
impact, they should always be in dilute solution, and extreme caution
should be taken during their utilization as reactants. Although no
difficulties were faced during the handling of these compounds, one
should make all manipulations inside a hood behind the safety shield.
Any mechanical action involving scratching or scraping should be avoided;
all safety cautions should be exercised during handling.

4.2 General Information
Chemicals were
purchased from commercially available resources and used without further
purification. 1H, 13C, DEPT-135, and HSQC spectra
were recorded on JEOL-JNM ECX-500 MHz NMR spectrometers by using CDCl3/DMSO-d6 as solvent. Chemical
shifts are reported relative to tetramethylsilane (1H and 13C). FT-IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrometer.
high-resolution mass spectrometry spectra were recorded on a Bruker
impact-HD spectrometer. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies were
performed on an Agilent Technologies X-ray diffractometer system.
A CEM-Discover microwave synthesizer was used for synthesis. The energy
release and decomposition temperature were studied on a thermogravimetric
analyzer and differential scanning calorimeter TGA/DSC 1 (Mettler
Toledo). The thermograms were recorded from 25 to 1000 °C at
a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under an inert
atmosphere of nitrogen gas in an open alumina crucible.

4.3 X-ray Crystallography
A single crystal
of PN4 suitable for X-ray diffraction
was grown in DCM/methanol at room temperature by slow evaporation.
Diffraction studies were performed on an Agilent Technologies X-ray
diffractometer system by irradiating the crystals using Cu Kα
λ radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 293(2) K, which revealed
that it crystallizes in the monoclinic I2/a space group. Data were collected by standard “CrysalisPro”
software (online version) and reduction was undertaken with CrysalisPro
software (offline version). The molecular structure was solved by
direct methods OLEX2 and was refined using full-matrix
least-squares (F2) on SHELXL. The positions
of all nonhydrogen atoms were located and were refined anisotropically.
After that, hydrogen atoms were obtained from the residual density
map and refined with isotropic thermal parameters. The CCDC number
1043488 was obtained for PN4 from
“The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC)”
by depositing the structure at http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/. The data can be obtained free of
charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.

4.4 Theoretical Study
All structures
were optimized using the B3LYP functional with the 6-31g* basis set
using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.27 The input files of molecular conformation of all compounds except PN4 were generated in GaussView 5.28 The SC-XRD structure for PN4 was
used as the input file for the density functional theory studies.
Frequency calculations at the same level were performed to ensure
that the structures correspond to minima. Single point energy calculations
were performed at 6-31+g**. These single point energy values were
used for calculation of the gas phase heat of formation. Volumes of
each species were calculated using the B3LYP functional with the 6-31+g**
basis set. The output files from the Gaussian package were obtained,
and they were visualized in MOLDEN.29 Then,
the Z-matrix was seen and converted into an input
file for MOPAC.30 The input files for MOPAC
were executed and the heats of formation for the given molecules were
obtained. The detonation pressure and velocity of the compounds were
calculated using EXPLO5_V6.03.31 The condensed
heat of formation (ΔHc) for PN4–PN6 was calculated using eqs 2 and 3: 2   3  where ΔHsub is the enthalpy of
sublimation and Tm is the melting point
(kelvin).
