Protein
L (PpL) is a bacterial protein which is used in the affinity
chromatography stage of the production of monoclonal antibodies because
of its ability to form high affinity complexes with the light chains
of immunoglobulins. In the present work, the binding interfaces between
one domain of PpL and antigen-binding fragments (Fab) have been investigated
adopting molecular dynamics with the aim of determining the binding
contribution of the residues located at the Fab–PpL interface.
Because it is known that PpL binds antibodies through two distinct
binding sites with different affinities, simulations were performed
for both sites to determine interaction free energies to assess the
relative binding contribution of the two sites. Mutational studies
were then performed only on the dominant binding site. The binding
free energy was evaluated with the molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann
surface area (MMPBSA) and umbrella sampling/weighted histogram analysis
methods. Key residues for the formation of the dominant binding site
complex were identified by means of alanine scanning performed both
for the Fab and PpL domains. Residues of the light chain of the antibody
that contribute most to binding were found to be located between SER7
and VAL13. Four residues from PpL are important for the stability
of the complex: PHE839, LYS840, GLU849, and TYR853. Three residues
of PpL that do not contribute to the interaction were mutated to histidine
(HIS), which changes its protonation state as a function of pH, to
find whether this could allow us to control the binding interaction
energy. This can be useful in the elution stage of the affinity chromatography
purification of antibodies if PpL is used as a ligand. These residues
are GLN835, THR836, and ALA837. Molecular dynamics simulations with
both protonated and unprotonated HIS were performed to mimic how changing
pH may reflect on protein–ligand interaction energies. The
MMPBSA approach was used to evaluate the variation of the affinity
of the mutated systems with reference to the wild type. Our results
show that these mutations could help in disrupting the complex under
acidic conditions without impairing the affinity of PpL for the light
chains at higher pHs.

1 Introduction
Monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) are one of the most promising classes
of biological drugs, both for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes,
with a constantly growing significance in the pharmaceutical industry
for the last 30 years. The mAb market value in 2010 was of about $40
billion,1 and it is expected to be of nearly
$125 billion by 2020.2 Many formats of
mAbs are commercially available. Complete antibodies are formed by
fragment crystallizable (Fc) and antigen-binding fragments (Fab) domains,
whereas the antibody fragments are constituted only by the regions
that bind the antigens, such as Fabs and single-chain variable fragments
(scFvs). ScFvs consist of variable domains of heavy and light chains,
joined together by a flexible peptide linker. Both Fabs and scFvs
penetrate tumors much more rapidly than whole antibodies and have
a very short serum half-life because of their limited dimensions (50
and 25 kDa, respectively).3 Because of
the complexity of these macromolecules and the presence of many different
compounds in the production media, the purification step of the production
of mAbs and antibody fragments is crucial. The first recovery step
in the downstream processing of mAbs is affinity chromatography, a
purification methodology that is based on the selective interaction
between the solute in the mobile phase to be purified and the affinity
ligand in the stationary phase. The most common ligand for mAb purification
is staphylococcal protein A,4 which shows
a strong affinity for the Fc region of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and
has been largely studied in the last 30 years both experimentally
and in silico.5−15 Antibody fragments do not have the Fc domain, thus protein L (PpL)
is used in the purification step, instead of protein A or protein
G.16 PpL is a cell wall protein of the
bacterium Peptostreptococcus magnus(17) that contains four or five homologous
domains, depending on the bacterial strain,18 capable of binding the VL regions of κ1, κ3,
and κ4 light chains with strong affinity (Kd ≈ 10–9 M), but not κ2
and λ subgroups,19 with no restriction
on the class of the Ig. The Ig binding domains of PpL contain a four-stranded
β-sheet with a single α-helix, similarly to IgG binding
domains of protein G from group C and G Streptococci.20 PpL interacts with antibodies through two independent binding
sites, denoted here as binding site 1 and binding site 2. The first
interface involves the second β-strand and the α-helix,
whereas the other involves the third β-strand and the α-helix.21 Both binding sites interact with the second
β-strand of the Vκ domain of Igs. VL chains that do not bind PpL have been successfully engineered to
add the capability of binding PpL, by substituting the N-terminal
sequence corresponding to Vκ FR1 into the sequence
of the VL chain of the antibodies.22,23 In this paper, we investigate the interaction between one domain
of PpL and Fab fragments using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
with the aim of determining free interaction energies between the
protein and the ligand for both binding sites and then evaluate the
contributions to the binding affinity of the residues of both PpL
and Fab fragments for the dominant binding site. Then, the effect
of mutations to histidine and of its protonation state on the dominant
binding site affinity has been investigated. In principle, this allows
us to find mutations of PpL that could make the use of milder conditions
possible during the elution process of an affinity chromatography
purification cycle because the low pH used to recover the product,
between 2 and about 3.5,24 can induce aggregation
and conformational changes in the antibodies.25,26 The rational is that the mutation of residues that do not contribute
to binding into histidines may help to tune the interaction energy
between the protein and the ligand. In fact at pHs higher than about
5, histidine residues are usually not protonated and are uncharged,
and thus the mutation of a nonbinding residue to histidine is not
likely to impact significantly the strength of the protein–protein
interaction. As the pH decreases, histidines will eventually get protonated
and thus, most likely, lead to the establishment of repulsive electrostatic
interactions that will decrease the system interaction energy.

2 Results and Discussion
PpL interacts with the variable
chain of antibodies through two
distinct binding sites. Interaction free energies for the PpL–Fab
complexes via both interfaces were evaluated using two approaches.
Crystal 1MHH was used to evaluate the free energy of interaction of binding site
1 by means of the molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface
area (MMPBSA) approach, whereas crystal 1HEZ was used to calculate the free energy
of interaction of both binding interfaces, using the MMPBSA and weighted
histogram analysis (WHAM) methodologies. In this section, the results
of MD simulations are discussed and compared with experimental values
available in the literature. In section 2.1, the results of models of binding site
1 are reported, whereas the results of the modeling of binding site
2 are presented in section 2.2. Finally, in section 2.3, a mutational study has been conducted to evaluate
possible mutants of PpL that may allow milder elution conditions during
the elution phase of the purification process.

2.1 Modeling
of the Binding Site 1 Interaction
The binding site 1 interaction
between Fab fragments and a PpL
domain was investigated to evaluate the free energy of binding and
to identify the residues, from both PpL and the Fab fragment, which
contribute most to the strength of the affinity interaction. Two molecular
models have been used to study the first binding interface. The starting
structures were obtained from the crystal structures deposited in
the Protein Data Bank as 1HEZ(21) and 1MHH.27 The structure of the 1MHH complex is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Structure of the PpL–Fab
complex obtained from crystal structure 1MHH used as the starting
configuration for the simulations.

MD simulations of 20–25 ns in explicit water were
carried
out to study the conformational evolution of the Fab–PpL complexes
for the 1MHH and 1HEZ models,
respectively. Configurations from each simulation were saved every
10 ps for further analysis.

The free energy of binding as a
function of simulation time was
calculated using the MMPBSA approach. The results are summarized and
compared with the experimental value reported by Beckingham et al.28 in Figure 2. The calculated free binding energies averaged over
the last 5 ns of each simulation are reported in Table 1.

the first interface of PpL–Fab complexes

of simulation time for the 1MHH and 1HEZ binding complexes and comparison with the experimental data.21

Polar and nonpolar contributions to the interaction
free energy
are reported separately in Figure 3. The polar contribution was evaluated as the sum of
the polar terms of ΔEMM and ΔGsol, which are the electrostatic energy calculated
with the Coulomb’s law using an infinite cutoff (ΔEcoul) and the solvation free energy obtained
solving the Poisson–Boltzmann equation (ΔGPB). The nonpolar contribution was estimated as the sum
of van der Waals energy (ΔEvdW)
and the free energy associated with the solvent accessible surface
area (ΔGSASA). The data analysis
shows that the interaction between PpL and the antibody fragment is
driven by nonpolar interactions, whereas the polar contribution is
unfavorable to the formation of the complex. Formation of protein–ligand
complexes is often driven by nonpolar interactions because of the
presence of hydrophobic patches on the surface of the proteins involved
in the interaction. Although, in the case of the interaction between
Fab and PpL, the polar contribution is not favorable to the formation
of the binding, it is an important contribution to the formation of
other protein–ligand interactions involving antibodies, like
in the case of the IgG–protein A complex,7 which has been mentioned above. Fluctuations of the calculated
interaction energy shown in Figure 2 can be reasonably attributed to the relaxation of
the complexes from the initial conformation obtained from the crystallographic
structures. This is the reason why the final 5 ns of both simulations
have been used to evaluate binding free energies.

Figure 3 Polar and nonpolar contributions
to the binding free energies for
the PpL–Fab complexes calculated with the MMPBSA approach.

Curves for both models reported
in Figure 2 show the
presence of peaks of few kcal/mol.
The 1MHH model
has a peak at 7 ns, whereas the 1HEZ model shows a rapid variation of the
value of the binding free energy between 12 and 17 ns. Comparing Figure 2 with Figure 3, it is possible to note that
these variations are due to fluctuations of the polar contribution
to the overall binding free energy, given by the relaxation of the
proteins from the initial configuration obtained from the crystallographic
structures. It is important to highlight that both models converge
to the same value of binding free energy, averaged over the last 5
ns of each simulation, of about −10.50 kcal/mol. This value
differs from the average values calculated over the entire simulation
of −13.95 kcal/mol for the 1HEZ model and −8.30 kcal/mol for the 1MHH model.

An
alanine scanning analysis was performed on the residues in the
first interface from both Fab and PpL to determine the contribution
of each residue to the affinity binding. The results of the analysis
are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Variation of the binding free energy for the first binding interface
calculated substituting the amino acids of (a) Fab and (b) PpL with
alanine.

The substitutions to alanine of
five residues from the variable
chain of the Fab fragment cause an increase of ΔGbind between 2 and 4 kcal/mol. These residues are SER7,
PRO8, LEU11, VAL13, and GLU17. This is in agreement with what was
shown by Graille and co-workers,21 who
compared the amino acidic sequence of κ and λ subgroups
of human VL chains, highlighting that the PpL binding ability
is concentrated between THR5 and ALA12. In fact, three of them (SER7,
PRO8, and LEU11) are inside that interval, and one (VAL13) is just
one residue over. The relatively low contribution (less than 4 kcal/mol)
of these amino acids to the overall binding energy is consistent with
the fact that the interaction between PpL and Fab fragments is dependent
on the conformation of the main chain.21

Four residues from PpL contribute significantly to the strength
of the first binding interface. These residues are PHE839, LYS840,
GLU849, and TYR853. PHE839 and LYS840 are in the second β-strand,
whereas GLU849 and TYR853 are in the α-helix. The aromatic ring
of PHE839 is known to interact with the ring of PRO8 from the VL chain, and this interaction has been used to perform fluorometric
measurements substituting the phenylalanine with a tryptophan.29 GLU849 is involved in a salt bridge with LYS24
from the VL chain, whereas LYS840 is involved in a hydrogen
bond with SER9. The greatest contribution to the affinity between
PpL and the Fab is given by TYR853. This residue is well known in
the literature for its importance in the stability of the interaction.
Beckingham et al.28 have shown that the
substitution of TYR853 with a phenylalanine leads to a 23-fold drop
in affinity. Roque et al.30 proposed an
artificial ligand, named ligand 8/7, that may resemble the pocket
formed by TYR853, PHE839, and GLU838. Svensson et al.31 estimated the equilibrium dissociation constant with kinetic
titration experiments on some PpL mutations and found that the greatest
contributions to binding site 1 affinity are from PHE839 and TYR853,
which is in good agreement with our predictions. Our calculations
also correctly show that TYR851, which is an important residue for
the strength of the affinity interaction of binding site 2,31 does not contribute to the interaction of the
first interface. This is because TYR851, though located in the α-helix
of PpL like its homologous TYR853, faces away from the binding site
1.

The key residues of PpL and the Fab fragment are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Key residues of binding
site 1 identified with alanine scanning
analysis for (a) Fab and (b) PpL.

2.2 Modeling of Binding Site 2
The second
binding interface was investigated through 25 ns of MD simulation
in explicit water starting from the 1HEZ crystal structure. The MMPBSA has been
used to estimate the free energy of interaction. In Figure 6, the result of the MMPBSA
calculation is reported. In this case, the model is unable to reproduce
the experimental value of 7 kcal/mol reported by Graille et al.,21 and a drift toward lower values of the calculated
binding free energy is present. This seems to suggest that the system
is reaching a state that is more stable than the initial configuration,
but important configurational modifications in the structure of both
Fab and PpL have not been observed during the simulation time. A possible
reason is that conformational changes during the formation of the
complex determine an error in the energy estimation through the MMPBSA
protocol. One of the hypotheses underlying the one-trajectory approach
for the MMPBSA is that no conformational change occurs during the
formation of the complex. This is because to compute the binding free
energy with this approach, only one MD simulation of the complex is
required, and the sampling of the conformations of the protein and
the ligand is obtained from the sampling of the complex. Alternatively,
it might be that the modification of the protein structure done by
Graille et al. to investigate separately the contributions of the
two binding sites to the complex modifies the protein binding properties.
This complicates our interpretation of the experimental results as
it makes the identification of the dominant binding site unclear,
which is necessary to focus our in silico mutational study properly.
To further investigate this aspect, we decided to determine the protein
binding energy at a higher level of theory.

Figure 6 Binding free energy of
binding site 2 for the PpL–Fab complex
calculated using the MMPBSA approach and reported as a function of
simulation time.

A first possibility to
improve the quality of the MMPBSA free energy
predictions would be to run additional MD simulations of the protein
and the ligand, so that conformations of the unbound state may be
properly sampled. Unfortunately, this three-trajectory approach, though
slightly more computationally demanding, suffers from the problem
that intermolecular terms in the calculation of the molecular mechanics
energy do not cancel out, thus adding a significant numerical noise
to the computational results. For this reason, we chose to use the
computationally much more demanding, but more accurate, WHAM approach.
The distance between the centers of mass (COMs) of PpL and Fab was
used as reaction coordinate. This is motivated by the fact that both
Fab and PpL do not undergo large conformational variations, keeping
their native fold. 58 windows were used for the umbrella sampling
(US) simulations, with a constant spacing of 0.5 Å, from 25.5
to 54.0 Å. A harmonic constant of 19 kcal mol–1 Å–2 was used to force the system in the center
of the windows. The calculated potential of mean force (PMF) is shown
in Figure 7. The calculated
interaction free energy for the second interface is 7.25 kcal/mol,
thus in excellent agreement with the value reported by Graille et
al.21 mentioned above and supporting our
interpretation of the probable cause of the discrepancy between MMPBSA
and experimental data. The absolute minimum of the PMF is at a distance
between the COMs of 28 Å. After that, a first steep rise of 3
kcal/mol of the potential is found at 35 Å, where the system
reaches an intermediate state, whereas a second rise takes place at
45 Å, where a plateau is reached and the two molecules get unbound.
Analyzing the MD trajectories it could be observed that the first
steep rise of the PMF at 35 Å is due to the disruption of the
hydrogen bond formed by TYR851 and the backbone of the VL chain of the Fab. The plateau between 35 and 45 Å is correlated
to the rotation of PpL around the bonding interaction of PHE843 and
ASN873 with ARG18. This interaction is then broken at 45 Å, which
determines the second steep rise of the PMF.

Figure 7 PMF for the second binding
interface evaluated as a function of
the distance between the COMs of PpL and Fab.

The present computational results support the experimental
results,
indicating the affinity by PpL and that the antibody is dominated
by binding site 1. In the following, therefore, we focused our study
on the possibility to tune the energy of this interaction on the modification
of residues that were found to be located in the proximity of binding
site 1.

2.3 Mutational Study
A typical affinity
chromatography cycle is formed by an application phase, where the
protein–ligand complex is established, and an elution phase,
where the interaction is disrupted by means of a variation in ionic
strength or buffer pH. To allow the release of the antibody from the
ligand, a pH lower than 4 is often required, but a low pH can damage
the product leading to denaturation and/or aggregation,32 and thus milder conditions are preferable. One
way to make the use of milder conditions possible is making the interaction
between the protein and the ligand weaker during the elution phase,
possibly without making the interaction weaker during the application
phase. To do so, we tested three mutations to histidine of PpL residues
located in the protein–ligand interface of binding site 1,
the dominant binding site among the two studied here, that have a
low contribution to the stability of the complex. The residues from
PpL that we chose to mutate are GLN835, THR836, and ALA837 from the 1MHH model. All the mutated
residues are located in the second β-strand of the PpL domain.
For each mutation, we performed two MD simulations, testing both the
protonated and the deprotonated state of the imidazole ring, with
the aim of mimicking a change in pH. Free energies of interaction
have been calculated with the MMPBSA approach and have been compared
with the reference value. The results are reported in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Variation of binding
free energy for single-point mutations to
protonated (HISP) and not protonated (HISE) histidines using the 1MHH model as the reference
evaluated using the MMPBSA approach.

It can be noted that, for the residues mutated to deprotonated
histidine (HISE), no weakening of the interaction should occur during
the application phase of the chromatographic cycle, but in the case
of GLN835, the affinity can increase by about 4 kcal/mol. For all
the mutations to protonated histidine (HISP), a weakening of the interaction
could occur during the elution phase, allowing milder conditions during
the process. The weakening of the interaction may be due to the proximity
of these residues with positively charged residue of the VL chain or with polar residues of the PpL domain that interact with
the VL chain. In particular, ALA837 is close to TYR853,
which is one of the most important residues to the affinity interaction.
TYR853 interacts with THR20 in the VL chain by means of
a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of tyrosine and the backbone
of the VL chain. This hydrogen bond may be weakened by
the presence of the positive charge of the protonated HIS837. Svensson
et al.31 report that the mutation of the
same residue to arginine disrupts binding site 1.

3 Conclusions
The interaction between Fab fragments and PpL
has been investigated
using MD simulations. PpL binds antibodies via two distinct binding
sites. Molecular models of both interactions have been built from
crystal structures available in the Protein Data Bank. These molecular
models have been used to estimate the binding free energy of both
the interactions, by means of two different approaches, MMPBSA and
WHAM. Values of the free energy of interaction have been compared
with those available in the literature. The properties of the first
binding interface have been investigated through an alanine scanning
analysis that allowed us to identify the residues that contribute
most to the affinity binding. This analysis confirms that the affinity
of PpL for the antibodies is dependent on the conformation of the
light chain. The key residues of κ light chains are mostly located
in the second β strand. Four residues of PpL establish strong
interactions with the light chains. These residues, namely PHE839,
LYS840, GLU849, and TYR853, have been often mutated to study and disrupt
the first binding interface. The results of the alanine scanning analysis
agree with the data reported in the literature. From the alanine scanning
analysis, we identified three possible single-point mutations to histidine
that could be exploited to allow milder conditions for the desorption
of the antibodies during the elution stage. The mutated residues are
GLN835, THR836, and ALA837 and belong to the second beta strand of
PpL. These mutations can be tested experimentally to validate the
molecular model presented here.

4 Methods
4.1 Molecular Models
Molecular models
of the interaction between PpL and Fab fragments were built starting
from two crystal structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB
ID: 1HEZ(21) and 1MHH(27)). The 1HEZ crystal is composed
by one C* domain of PpL33 in complex with
two Fab fragments of human IgM. This structure was used to model the
interaction between PpL and Fab fragments via both binding interfaces:
binding site 1 interaction was modeled using chains A, B, and E, whereas
binding site 2 was modeled using chains C, D, and E. The 1MHH crystal
structure includes two complexes formed by PpLD55A domains
with murine Fab with a VLκ9 region. We used one of
the two complexes (chains A, B, and E) to model the binding site 1
interaction.

The heavy chains of the Fab fragments in both crystal
structures have missing residues. They were rebuilt by homology modeling
using the MODELLER interface in UCSF Chimera 1.6.1.34 Chain F from crystal structure 1DEE(8) and chain
D from crystal structure 1YMH(35) were used as templates
to build the homology model of the heavy chains of structures 1HEZ and 1MHH, respectively.

4.2 Free Energy Calculations
Interaction
free energies between PpL and Fab were evaluated by means of two computational
methodologies. The first approach is MMPBSA,36 and the other one is the WHAM, which was used to reconstruct the
PMF from US simulations.37

4.2.1 MD Simulations
All MD simulations
were performed in explicit water and ions with an ionic strength of
150 mM. Periodic boundary conditions were applied, and long range
electrostatic interactions were evaluated with the particle mesh Ewald
method38 with a nonbonded cutoff of 10
Å. All MD simulations were performed at 300 K and 1 bar. The
temperature was controlled using the v-rescale algorithm.39 Protein and nonprotein molecules have been controlled
separately to avoid the hot solvent/cold solute effect.40 The pressure has been controlled using the Parrinello–Rahman
algorithm.41 All bond lengths have been
constrained using LINCS,42 which allowed
a time step of 2.0 fs. MD simulations have been performed using the
GROMACS 4.5.5 package.43 Proteins and ligands
were modeled with the AMBER03 force field,44 and the TIP3P force field45 was used
to model water molecules. MD simulations have been prepared following
a two-step protocol: 1000 steps of energy minimization with the steepest
descent algorithm to remove unfavorable contacts between the solvent
and the solute, followed by 100 ps of position-restrained dynamics
to let water molecules distribute themselves around the solute at
a constant volume and a constant temperature, using a position restraint
on the heavy atoms of the solute with a harmonic constant of 2.4 kcal
mol–1 Å–2.

4.2.2 Molecular Mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann
Surface Area
The MMPBSA approach allows us to evaluate the
free energy of binding ΔGbind for
a protein–ligand complex as the sum of three terms: 1  where ΔEMM is the molecular mechanics contribution in
the gas phase, calculated
as the sum of electrostatic and van der Waals energies. The entropic
term, TΔSgas, was
evaluated as the difference of rotational and translational entropy
in the gas phase between the complex, Fab, and PpL. This term was
computed through statistical thermodynamics referring to the corresponding
molecular partition functions. The vibrational contribution to TΔSgas has been neglected,
mainly because of the difficulty of estimation for large protein molecules.
Not taking into account, this term is likely to introduce an uncertainty
of few kcal/mol in the calculated binding free energy. For the Fab–PpL
complexes, the TΔSgas contribution is about 34 kcal/mol. Finally, ΔGsol is the free energy of solvation, evaluated as the
sum of polar and nonpolar terms. The polar term is calculated by solving
the Poisson–Boltzmann equation, whereas the nonpolar term is
evaluated as a function of the change in SASA of the proteins 2  where γ = 5 cal mol–1 Å–2 and b = 860 cal mol–1.46 All the right-side
terms in eq 1 are evaluated
as the difference of the value for the complex and the value for Fab
and PpL.

The g_energy program in GROMACS 4.5.5 was used to determine
the molecular mechanics energy contribution. The g_sasa program was
used to evaluate the SASA for complex, protein, and ligand configurations.
The APBS 1.3 program47 was used to determine
the polar contribution to free energies of solvation. The pdb2pqr
program48 was used to create the input
files for APBS. Configurations of the Fab–PpL complexes for
the MMPBSA calculations were generated with 20–25 ns of MD
simulations in a 10 × 10 × 10 Å simulation box. Structures
of Fab–PpL complexes have been collected every 10 ps. Structures
of Fab and PpL have been obtained from the structures of the complexes,
following the single-trajectory approach.49

4.2.3 Potential of Mean Force
The PMF
relative to the unbinding process of the second interface has been
recovered from US simulations using the WHAM. The starting configuration
of the complex was extracted from the last frame of the MD simulation
of the 1HEZ model.
The complex was then rotated to align the COMs of PpL and Fab along
the y-axis of the solvation box. Simulations were
performed in a box of 10 × 13 × 10 Å. PpL was progressively
removed from the Fab fragment through a series of MD simulations where
the distance between the COM of PpL and Fab have been constantly increased
with steps of 0.5 Å by applying a 24 kcal mol–1 Å–2 harmonic potential along the y-axis. The last snapshot of each simulation was used as
the starting point for US simulations where the distance of COMs of
PpL and Fab was restrained by applying a 19 kcal mol–1 Å–2 harmonic potential. The values of the
distance between the COMs of PpL and Fab have been saved every 100
fs for WHAM analysis. WHAM equations were solved using our in-house
code50 until the difference between two
successive values of the PMF differs by less than 10–5 kcal/mol.

4.2.4 Computational Alanine
Scanning
An alanine scanning analysis of the first interface
was performed
to determine the amino acidic contribution to the free energy of binding
using the 1MHH molecular model. Nonalanine and nonglycine residues in the Fab–PpL
interface were mutated one by one to alanine, and the free energies
of binding for the mutated systems were then evaluated following the
MMPBSA approach36 described in section 4.2.2. Because
the side chain of alanine is constituted only by a methyl group, mutations
of the residues to alanine were done by deleting all the atoms of
the side chain but the Cβ. Hydrogens of the mutated side chain
were then added with the pdb2gmx program. Binding free energy for
the mutated system was compared with the value obtained for the wild
type protein to identify the residues that contribute to affinity
binding. The structures of the complex used for the analysis have
been extracted from the last 5 ns of the trajectory of the 1MHH model.

4.2.5 Mutational Study
The strong affinity
between antibodies and Ig binding proteins, such as PpL, protein G,
and protein A, has the drawback of requiring harsh conditions during
the elution phase, like pH well under 4.0, to disrupt the binding
and recover the purified antibody. The very low pH can induce agglomeration
and loss of the native conformation of the product. A possible way
to circumvent this problem is to engineer the affinity ligand to allow
the desorption under milder conditions. This is done by mutating one
or more residues in the binding interface. A notable approach is the
mutation of residues to histidine to obtain a pH-dependent binding.
In fact, histidine residues have an imidazole side chain that switches
between protonated and unprotonated states at slightly acidic pH,
near its pKa. Point mutations to histidine
have been performed on protein G and PpL allowing higher pH during
the elution phase.51,52 To find possible mutations to
histidine that could allow an easier desorption of antibodies from
PpL during the elution phase, we identified three residues belonging
to the first binding interface of PpLD55A that do not contribute
to the binding affinity. These residues were mutated to histidine
using the rotamers tool available in the UCSF Chimera 1.6 software.53 The protonation state of the mutated histidine
was then selected with the pdb2gmx program in GROMACS 4.5.5. For each
structure, two models have been created: one with a neutral histidine
(HISE), to simulate the adsorption stage of the affinity chromatography
cycle, and the other with a charged histidine (HISP), to mimic the
low pH conditions of the elution stage. MD simulations (20 ns) have
been carried out, and the relative binding free energies with respect
to the 1MHH model
were evaluated by means of the MMPBSA approach described above.
