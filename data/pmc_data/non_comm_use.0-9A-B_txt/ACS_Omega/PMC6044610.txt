A novel class of bifunctional molecules
was synthesized integrating
acridine (Ac) and redox-active naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffolds
directly and through a flexible linker (en). We evaluated in vitro
antiplasmodial activity, physicochemical properties, and a possible
mode of action. Theoretical studies suggested electronic segmentation
between the electron-rich Ac and electron-deficient NDI scaffolds.
Orthogonal Ac–NDI molecules showed activities in the micromolar
to submicromolar range against a chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive strain
of human malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum (maximum activity, IC50: 0.419 μM). The flexible
Ac–en–NDI molecules were most potent and showed activity
in the nanomolar range against both CQ-sensitive (with most effective
compounds, IC50: 3.65 and 4.33 nM) as well as CQ-resistant
(with most effective compounds, IC50: 52.20 and 28.53 nM)
strains of P. falciparum. Significantly,
with CQ-resistant strains, the activity of the most effective compounds
was 1 order of magnitude better than that of standard drug CQ. Ac–en–NDI-conjugated
molecules were significantly more potent than the individual NDI and
Ac-based molecules. The structure–activity relationship (SAR)
suggests that the flexible spacer (en) linking the Ac and NDI scaffolds
plays a vital role in exhibiting improved potency. None of the molecules
triggered hemolysis in culture, and the most potent compounds did
not show cytotoxicity in vitro against mammalian fibroblast NIH3T3
cells at their respective IC50 values. The other significant
outcome of this work is that some of the investigated molecules have
the potential to affect multiple processes in the parasite including
the hemozoin formation in digestive vacuoles (DVs), mitochondrial
membrane potential, and the redox homeostasis of the parasite.

Introduction
Malaria, caused by
an apicomplexan parasite of the genus Plasmodium,
remains one of the world’s greatest health
challenges along with tuberculosis and AIDS. According to World Health
Organization’s (WHO) 2014 world malaria report, globally 198
million cases of malaria were reported in 2013, which have accounted
for the loss of 584 000 human lives.1 Chemotherapy has long been the mainstay for the control and eradication
of malaria as no effective vaccine against malaria is available in
the market.2,3 Resistance to currently available antimalarial
drugs, including artemisinin and artemisinin-based combination therapy
(ACT), has become a major threat in malaria chemotherapy.4,5 Combination therapy, where two or more drugs with different biological
functions are coformulated in a single tablet, has limitations of
high cost and risk of unwanted drug–drug interactions.6 Therefore, it is very important to search for
new chemotherapeutic strategies to develop effective and affordable
new antimalarial drugs.

The concept of fusing two different
pharmacophores with individual
intrinsic activity to produce a single bifunctional agent known as
hybrid drug designing has recently attracted immense interest of the
medicinal chemistry community owing to the capability of bifunctional
drugs to overcome drug resistance.7−9 Indeed, a number of bifunctional
drugs have been successfully applied in the treatment of cancer,10 bacterial infection,11 fungal infection,12 and several pathogenic
diseases including malaria,7−9 leishmaniasis,13 and trypanosomiasis.14 The integration
of individual pharmacophores leads to a new molecular electronic profile
quite different from that of individual pharmacophores in the bifunctional
molecule. This change in the molecular electronic profile could be
modulated to manifest effectiveness in the bifunctional molecules
against drug-resistant strains. Importantly, in the bifunctional molecule,
two pharmacophores act on different targets with their independent
mode of action that makes the emergence of drug resistance less likely.7−9 Several problems with the known pharmacophores, for example, poor
solubility, low bioavailability due to short retention time in bloodstream,
and poor cell permeability, can be resolved by judicious designing
of bifunctional molecules.10 There can
be several benefits of the bifunctional molecular approach, which
includes (a) tailorability in synthesis, (b) potentially lower cost
of synthesis, and (c) lower risk of adverse drug–drug interactions
compared to the multicomponent drugs in a single tablet.6−9 In this context, it is important to note that bifunctional molecules
such as trioxaquine (PA1103/SA4R116242)15 and ferroquine (Fq/SSR97193)16 are under
clinical trials as hybrid antimalarial agents.

The acridine
(Ac)-based compounds are well known for their wide
range of biological activities such as antimicrobial,17 antitumoral,18 antiprion,19 anti-Alzheimer,20 antileishmanial, antitrypanosomal,21 and
antimalarial activities.22 Quinacrine (QN),
a 9-amino Ac, has been used for the treatment of malaria with limited
success.23 Recently, we have successfully
evaluated the antimalarial activity of acriflavine, an Ac-based dye,
and its mechanism of action (MOA).24

In recent times, the redox homeostasis of malarial parasites has
emerged as a valid drug target in malaria chemotherapy.25 The parasite is exposed to high fluxes of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) released from heme and decomposition products
generated in the course of the major hemoglobin digestion process
during its intraerythrocytic life cycle. An effective thiol-based
redox network is present in Plasmodium to protect it from high fluxes of ROS. Thus, maintaining intracellular
redox equilibrium is very important for the survival of the parasite.26 Recent studies have revealed that redox-active
agents, such as derivatives of 1,4-naphthaquinone, are able to disrupt
the intracellular redox balance of the parasite, which results in
the death of the parasite.25,27 Further, the parasite
mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) is involved in certain
redox reactions (electron transfer process) of metabolic importance.
Atovaquone, a redox-active drug, is known to interfere with the electron
transfer process in the mETC, which results in the loss of the mitochondrial
membrane potential.28,29 Systematic studies on this type
of redox-active molecule acting as an antimalarial drug have been
extremely scarce. In this context, we wanted to explore the therapeutic
potential of bifunctional molecules having redox-active scaffolds
conjugated with known antimalarials.

Naphthalenediimides (NDIs)
because of their novel properties, for
example, optoelectronic, self-assembly, n-type semiconductor, anion
recognition and transport, DNA binding, and antitumor properties,
have gained phenomenal interest.30−43 The unique structure of NDI, where four carbonyl groups lie coplanar
to an extended aromatic ring system, allows interactions between the
guanine amino group of DNA base pairs and the intercalated ring systems
(via O atom of imide), making them an efficient DNA binding motif.
The DNA binding property of NDI has led to the discovery of various
NDI-based molecules exhibiting anticancer activity.41−43 Tetra-substituted
NDI derivatives have been reported to bind G quadruplexes and exert
in vivo antitumor activity.44,45 Substituents on NDI
greatly affect the DNA binding mode and affinity.46 Amino-acid-functionalized arylene diimide derivatives are
of special interest as biomimetic advanced functional materials for
wide spread application in fields ranging from biomedicine to electronics.47 Peptide-functionalized NDI compounds containing
more than one unit of NDI are known for threading polyintercalation
to DNA, and the long-lived DNA-bound complex suggested great therapeutic
potential of these compounds by altering the regulation of gene expression
in cells.48,49 Importantly, an NDI moiety has been extensively
used to synthesize several redox-active functional molecules, where
the NDI moiety undergoes one-electron reduction to generate an NDI
radical anion (NDI•–).50,51 We have demonstrated selective electron transfer (SET) from various
analytes to generate persistent NDI•– under
ambient conditions.52,53 Recently, we also isolated ambient
stable NDI radical ions.54 In addition,
pioneering research has been carried out with NDI•– for the fabrication of organic conductors, NIR absorptive nanotubes,
chiral gels, and so forth.55−57

In the search for the new
antimalarial drugs with new targets,
essential biological redox processes happening inside of the parasite,
for example, redox homeostasis in the cytoplasm and25−27 electron transfer
processes in mitochondria (mETC),28,29 are fascinating
targets. The redox activity of NDI suggests that it can be a promising
scaffold along with known antimalarial agents to enhance its activity.
To the best of our knowledge, an NDI scaffold has not been integrated
with known antimalarial pharmacophores to develop bifunctional therapeutics
to date. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of different classes
of conceptually new Ac–NDI bifunctional molecules. The new
classes of Ac–NDI molecules constitute (a) directly linked
Ac with NDI (Ac–NDI), molecules 1a–e, (b) Ac linked with NDI through a flexible spacer (Ac–en–NDI,
en = spacer), molecules 2a–c, (c)
a salt of antioxidant citrate 3, and (d) individual pharmacophore
units, molecules 4 and 5. We evaluated the
in vitro antimalarial activity, theoretical physicochemical properties,
and antimalarial MOA of these molecules. This provided us with a set
of diverse class of bifunctional molecules with interesting electronic,
redox, and H-bonding properties. The molecular design allowed us to
tune the polarity of the molecules by altering the axial groups in
the NDI scaffold. In addition, the linkage between the Ac and NDI
scaffolds could be modulated in a flexible (2a–c) or rigid manner (1a–e).
Further, a bifunctional molecular designing approach enables access
to multiple cellular processes such as hemozoin, redox homeostasis,
and mitochondrial membrane potential of the parasite by a single agent.
This was reflected in the better antimalarial activity of hybrids 2a and 2b compared to that of standard antimalarial
drug chloroquine (CQ) against both CQ-sensitive and CQ-resistant strains.
The IC50 values of hybrids 2a and 2b were found to be better than those of the individual pharmacophores 4 and 5.

Results and Discussion
Design and Synthesis
We hypothesized that the NDI scaffold
might facilitate the antimalarial activity of bifunctional molecules
by virtue of its (a) ability to interact with DNA by its planar π-extended
aromatic rings, (b) H bond formation ability of the O atoms of the
four imide groups with biological targets, and (c) redox activity,
that is, its ability to undergo one-electron reduction to form NDI•– that may perturb the redox homeostasis of
the parasite by interfering with the essential electron transfer processes
happening in the cytoplasm and/or the mitochondria. On the other hand,
the conjugation of Ac with NDI through a covalent linker would produce
a bifunctional molecule, which is electronically segmented, that is,
having both electron-rich and electron-deficient scaffolds integrated
within the same molecule. This novel electronic profile may confer
better characteristics in terms of hydrophilic–lipophilic balance
(HLB), activity, and effectiveness against drug-resistant strains,
which can be beyond the scope of the individual scaffolds. On the
basis of these attributes, we integrated the Ac scaffold with the
NDI to obtain a diverse range of Ac–NDI molecules (Scheme 1). In our design,
the modulation of HLB of the Ac–NDIs can also be achieved upon
varying the alkyl segments, which are linked axially to the NDI scaffold.
The ESP of 2a unequivocally established our prediction
of an electronically segmented molecule (Figure 1). The differential ESP of the Ac and the
NDI scaffolds in 2a compared to that of the NDI scaffold
in NDI(C4) and the
Ac scaffold in 5 is clearly evident from Figure 1. Further,
the electronic segmentation of 2a was confirmed from
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) surfaces. The HOMO and the LUMO surfaces
were found to be localized on the electron-rich Ac and the electron-deficient
NDI scaffolds, respectively (Figure S1).

Scheme 1 Molecular Structures
of Ac–NDI Hybrid Molecules
(a) Orthogonal design and
corresponding orthogonal Ac–NDI hybrid molecules (1a–e), (b) flexible design and corresponding Ac–en–NDI
hybrid molecules (2a–c), (c) citrate
salt (3), and (d) NDI (4) and 9-amino Ac
(5).

Toward the various bifunctional
molecules, we designed and synthesized
three classes of NDI-based molecular systems: (a) orthogonal Ac–NDI
(1a–e), (b) flexible Ac–en–NDI
(2a–c), and (c) an ion pair 3 containing the antioxidant citrate moiety. Apart from these
three classes, we also synthesized the individual molecules 4 and 5 (Scheme 1). The orthogonal Ac–NDIs and flexible Ac–en–NDIs
were synthesized in a straightforward manner using a one-pot synthetic
approach that entails a condensation reaction of the naphthalenetetracarboxylicacid
dianhydride (NTCDA) unit with appropriate derivatives of the 9-amino
Ac (Rx) and the alkyl amine (Ry), as outlined
in Scheme 2a,b. Appropriate
9-amino Acs (5, 7) (Scheme 3) were synthesized via the aromatic nucleophilic
substitution of 6,9-dichloro-2-methoxy Ac with an excess of alkyl
amine or diamino ethane under an inert atmosphere.58,59 The treatment of 6,9-dichloro-2-methoxy Ac with ammonium carbonate
in phenol furnished the 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxy Ac (6) (Scheme 3).60 The 9-amino Acs (6–7) were purified by precipitation in water medium with 70–80%
isolated yields and were pure enough to be engaged for the synthesis
of the next step. The NDI-based bifunctional molecules were synthesized
by a condensation reaction of NTCDA with appropriate Ac amine and
alkyl amine in N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) and purified by column chromatographic separation affording
5–30% yield. Citrate salt 3 was prepared in excellent
yield from the reaction of 2a with citric acid in methanol.
The characterization of these molecules was carried out by NMR, FTIR,
and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Supporting Information). A detailed account of the synthesis and characterization has been
given in the experimental procedures.

The single crystal X-ray structure of 1b revealed
an orthogonal orientation of the two π surfaces (Ac and NDI)
(Figure 2, Table S1, and Experimental
Section). It is also clearly evident from the crystal structure
of 1b that each of the pharmacophores (Ac and NDI) is
capable of generating multiple noncovalent interactions (NDI: π–π
interaction and H bonding, Ac: H bonding) to form the self-assembled
crystal lattice (Figure S2).

Antiplasmodial Activity and Structure–Activity
Relationships
(SARs)
The in vitro antimalarial activity of a compound is
evaluated by the amount of compound required to inhibit 50% of the
growth of various Plasmodium falciparum strains (IC50). All (11 new derivatives) of the Ac–NDIs
and other molecules synthesized as described above (Scheme 1) were subjected to screening
for in vitro antimalarial potency against Pf 3D7
(CQ-sensitive P. falciparum strain)
using a microtiter-based SYBR Green I fluorescence assay.61 All of the experiments were carried out twice
and with duplicate samples. Data are reported as the geometric mean
of IC50 values ±SD (standard deviation) obtained from
two individual experiments (Table 1). The growth inhibition curves of all of the molecules
are presented in the Supporting Information.

Amongst the
11 molecules tested, five molecules (2a–c, 3, and 5) exhibited
good potency (IC50 < 100 nM) against the CQ-sensitive
3D7 strain. The remaining compounds had IC50 values ranging
between 260 and 4197 nM as described in Table 1. Orthogonal Ac–NDIs (series a: 1a–e; >0.4–4.0 μM) demonstrated
considerably less antiplasmodial activity than the flexible Ac–en–NDIs
(series b: 2a–c; <10 nM).

SAR studies indicate that the incorporation of the 6-chloro-2-methoxy-substituted
Ac scaffold into 1a–b has a significant
positive effect on the antiplasmodial activity. Thus, the IC50 values for 1a–b reduced from 4197
and 545 nM to 3778 and 419 nM, respectively, for 1d–e. On the basis of the considerable evidence that quinoline-
and Ac-based antimalarials inhibit hemozoin formation by forming complexes
between the heme and compound through π–π stacking
interactions between the aromatic ring of the compound and the porphyrin
ring system,58,62−67 it can be assumed that the introduction of these two substituents
enhances the stability of complexation with heme. The introduction
of basic nitrogen (−NMe2, imidazole) into the alkyl
chain (Ry) of 1b–c and 1e (IC50 values 545, 780, and 419 nM, respectively)
greatly improved the antimalarial activity on the CQ-sensitive strain
in comparison to the less basic alkyl chain bearing 1a and 1d (4197 and 3778 nM, respectively). The beneficial
effect of basic nitrogen in the alkyl chain can be attributed to the
enhanced accumulation of 1b–c and 1e in the digestive vacuole (DV) of the parasite. This also
supports the notion that the basicity of the alkyl chain in these
molecules plays a crucial role similar to known quinoline- and Ac-based
antimalarials.64−71 The spacer linking Ac and NDI had a dramatic influence on the antimalarial
activity. Flexible Ac–en–NDI (series b) with an amino-alkyl
spacer exhibited higher activity than orthogonal Ac–NDIs (series
a) without a spacer against the 3D7 strain. 2a and 2b (3.65 and 4.33 nM) were nearly 1000- and 100-fold more
active against 3D7 than the 1d and 1e, respectively.
The higher activity of 2a–b may be
attributed to mode of binding of these compounds to the heme. On the
basis of the available binding model of the quinoline ring with hematin,72−74 it can be proposed that the presence of the −NH group in
the spacer of the Ac–en–NDI hybrids enhances the stability
of the heme–compound complex by forming a H-bond between the
−NH group and −COOH group of the hematin. In the proposed
model (Figure S3a), imide oxygen of the
NDI also serves as a multiple H-bond acceptor unit and can also form
a H-bond with the −COOH group of the hematin, thus providing
extra stability to the complex. We anticipate that the rigid structure
of orthogonal Ac–NDIs did not allow the NDI scaffold to form
effective H-bonds with the −COOH group of hematin. In the class
of flexible molecules (2a–c), the
increase in basicity of the alkyl chain did not play a dominant role
in their activity, whereas in the case of orthogonal Ac–NDI
series, basicity had played a predominant role. Compound 3 (citrate salt of 2a) and 2a also displayed
a nearly similar activity (3.89 and 3.65 nM, respectively). Compounds 2a–c and 3 exhibited more
potency, for example, 3.4-, 2.9-, 1.5-, and 3.2-fold, respectively,
compared to CQ against the 3D7 strain.

Finally, the most potent
molecules 2a–b from the flexible
Ac–en–NDI series were screened
for their potency against Pf W2 (CQ-resistant P. falciparum strain) using microtiter-based SYBR
Green I fluorescence assay. 2a–b (52.20,
28.53 nM) exhibited ∼8- and 15-fold higher antimalarial activity,
respectively, than CQ (430.60 nM) against the Pf W2
strain, and they also displayed comparatively better RIs than CQ (Table 1). 2b was nearly 2-fold more active than 2a against the CQ-resistant
strain. This higher activity of 2b against the resistant
strain can be attributed to the intramolecular H-bond formation ability
of 2b at physiological pH. Guy et al. demonstrated that
the incorporation of the intramolecular H-bonding motif in the side
chain enhances the antimalarial potency of compounds against the CQ-resistant
W2 strain.75 In our case, 2b contains a H-bond acceptor (−NMe2) on the alkyl
chain, which will be protonated at physiological pH that allows the
intramolecular H-bonding between the protonated terminal amine (H-bond
donor) and the oxygen atom of the imide group in NDI (Figure S3b). This type of intramolecular H-bond
formation is not possible in 2a because of the lack of
the −NMe2 functional group.

To ascertain specific
benefits of the Ac-NDI conjugate over the
individual constituents, the respective individual NDI (4) and Ac (9-(N-butyl) amino-6-chloro-2-methoxy-Ac
(5)) were screened for antimalarial activity (Figure 3). Notably, both
the individual NDI (4, IC50 = 260 nM) and
Ac (5, IC50 = 26.4 nM) displayed significantly
decreased potency over Ac–en–NDI (2c, IC50 = 8.44 nM) against P. falciparum, thereby demonstrating the potency of the NDI scaffold in the conjugated
Ac–NDI pharmacophore. It is important to recall that the effect
of an increase in the basicity of Ac–en–NDIs does not
reflect in their antimalarial activity, and also their antimalarial
activity is quite high (<10 nM). This may be attributed to the
existence of other drug targets of Ac–en–NDIs outside
of the DV, in addition to the hemozoin formation. Thus, the NDI scaffold
in these Ac–NDIs may be able to act on other drug targets and
play a significant role in the higher activity of these conjugate
molecules. It is pertinent to mention that the Ac–NDIs represent
a more promising scaffold over individual Ac/NDI because the probability
of the emergence of resistance against a hybrid pharmacophore is always
likely to be less than that in the case with individual pharmacophores.

activity of Ac–en–NDI (2c) compared to
individual components NDI (4) and 9-amino
Ac (5).

Assessment of the Cytotoxicity of the Most Potent Molecules
The cytotoxicity (CC50 values, Table 1) of the most potent molecules 2a–b was determined against mammalian (fibroblast
NIH3T3) cells using final concentrations ranging from 0.625 to 20
nM by MTT assay. No relevant CC50 could be obtained in
the concentration range tested. On the basis of these data, we extrapolated
a CC50 value >20 nM for all tested compounds (Figure S4). The studies reveal that the 2a–b are not significantly cytotoxic at
their corresponding antimalarial IC50 values. Further,
we also evaluated the SIs [SI = {CC50 (NIH3T3)}/{IC50 (Pf 3D7}] of all of these compounds (Table 1). 2a–b exhibited moderate SI values (>5.5 and
>4.6).
It is to be noted that even at higher micromolar drug concentrations
tested for the antimalarial activity (20–40 μM), the
absence of hemolysis of the infected and the noninfected red blood
cells (RBCs) may ascertain that these molecules may produce minimum
adverse effects in blood circulation even at higher concentrations.

Physicochemical Properties of the Conjugate Molecules
Physicochemical
properties such as aqueous solubility and lipophilicity
play a determining role in drug absorption as well as pharmacokinetic
profiles of molecules. A good HLB aids the molecule in passing through
biological membranes and barriers to eventually enter the systemic
circulation.76,77 A traditional method for the
evaluation of the druglikeness of a molecule is to check the compliance
of “Lipinski’s rule of five”.78,79 Calculated physicochemical properties of all of the synthesized
compounds except the citrate salt were evaluated80 to assess the compliance of Lipinski’s rule of five
(Table 2). Data showed
that (a) all molecules are compliant with H-bonding properties, (b)
all of the conjugate molecules have a log P in the
range of 4–6, which may indicate that the molecules are lipophilic,
(c) all of the conjugate molecules from the orthogonal and flexible
series [except 1a (MW: 499.52)] exhibit molecular weights
slightly higher (in the range of 514–660) than the accepted
value of 500, and (d) among all of the hybrid molecules 1a and 1d have log D values at pH 7.4
higher than 5.

Most active compounds (2a and 2b), which
have comparable activity (IC50 < 5 nM) against the CQ-sensitive
strain, are almost compliant with Lipinski’s rule of five with
no. of violations two and one, respectively. Comparing H-bonding properties
of Ac–en–NDI molecule 2c with individual
components 4 and 5, it is evident that the
number of H-bonding properties has been increased in conjugate 2c. This increase in number of H-bonding properties may be
attributed to the higher activity of conjugate molecules.

Plausible MOA
of the Conjugate Molecules against P.
falciparum
The existing knowledge about the mechanistic
details of antimalarial action of Ac derivatives is limited despite
findings suggesting Ac derivatives may target the inhibition of hemozoin
(β-hematin) formation, mitochondrial bc1 complex, DNA topoisomerase
II, and DNA gyrase.24,65,81 NDI and naphthalimide derivatives have been used as relevant pharmacophores
in anticancerous agents. The most consensual MOA of NDI and naphthalimide
derivatives against different cancers is the interaction with DNA
(ds DNA/G-quadruplex DNA).42−45 Here, we have examined the MOA of flexible Ac–en–NDI 2a, which is the most potent against the Pf 3D7 strain amongst the series of compounds studied by us.

The intraerythrocytic cycle of P. falciparum begins with the merozoite invasion of an erythrocyte, and it ends
48 h later when multiple new merozoites escape from the host cell.
In the meantime, Plasmodium grows through ring (0–20
h post invasion (p.i)), trophozoite (20–36 h p.i), and schizont
(36–48 h p.i) stages. To elucidate the MOA, we first evaluated
the effect of 2a at different stages of parasites to
understand the stage-specific effects. Synchronized ring- (∼12
h p.i), trophozoite- (∼24 h p.i), and schizont-stage (∼36
h p.i) parasites were treated with 50 nM 2a for 12 h.
The parasites were washed to remove drug pressure and followed by
incubation in drug-free complete media to complete the first life
cycle. After completion of the first life cycle, the growth was determined
using fluorescence-based SYBR Green I assay. Interestingly, the growth
of parasites indicated that 2a was more effective for
the ring- and trophozoite-stage parasites with a moderate effect on
the schizont-stage parasites (Figure 4). Compound 2a exhibited ∼30% inhibition
of growth at the schizont stage, whereas for ring and trophozoite
stages, inhibition of growth was ∼80% (Figure 4). Interestingly, the effects of 2a on ring- and trophozoite-stage parasites (12 h treatment) were similar
to continuous treatment of 2a in the complete cycle (36
h, beginning at the ring stage). Compound 2b also exerts
the same trend of growth inhibition (Figure S5). These results suggest that molecular targets common to both ring
and trophozoite stages are affected by Ac–NDI conjugate molecules.

of 2a on different intraerythrocytic stages
of malaria parasite P. falciparum (3D7).
Highly synchronized ring (∼12 h), trophozoite (∼24 h),
and schizont (∼36 h) stages were treated with 50 nM 2a for 12 h. After completion of treatment, parasites were washed to
remove drug pressure and subsequently resuspended in drug-free media
to complete the life cycle. Ring-stage parasites (∼12 h) were
also incubated continuously for 36 h. After completion of the first
life cycle, the growth of the parasites was determined by fluorescence-based
SYBR Green I assay. (a) Growth of different intraerythrocytic stages

For instance, hemozoin formation,
an essential process for the
survival of parasites, starts at the ring stage and continues until
the trophozoite stage. The process of hemozoin formation is linked
with the hemoglobin digestion in the food vacuole, as the release
of heme after hemoglobin digestion poses immediate demand for its
detoxification. Trophozoite is the most active stage at digesting
host cell hemoglobin and subsequent hemozoin formation.82,83 The food vacuole of the late-trophozoite-stage parasite becomes
full with hemozoin crystals, which can characterized microscopically.
To find if hemozoin formation may be a target for the antimalarial
action of Ac–NDI conjugates, we assessed whether conjugates 2a and 2b might inhibit trophozoite development.
Synchronized parasites at the midring stage (12 h p.i) were grown
either in normal culture media (no drug) or media supplemented with
50 nM 2a/2b or 5 μM CQ. Giemsa-stained
smears were prepared from aliquots of the cultures at different time
points. The morphology of the parasites was examined using a light
reflecting microscope. As shown in Figure 5, compound 2a and 2b or CQ had a dramatic effect on the maturation of trophozoites. In
all of the cases, ∼24 h treatment was sufficient enough to
prevent the parasite development, and no hemozoin was seen in the
food vacuole (Figure 5, 2a 24 h, 2b 24 h, and CQ 24 h). Parasite
condensation and the appearance of pycnotic forms were observed with
prolonged incubation of molecules 2a/2b (Figure 5, 2a/2b 48 h), contrasting with the shapeless uncondensed
forms observed with CQ (Figure 5, CQ 48 h). Thus, our results indicate that Ac–NDI
conjugates (2a and 2b) prevent the trophozoite
development possibly through inhibiting hemozoin formation.

trophozoite development. Synchronized ring-stage parasites (∼12
h) of the intraerythrocytic cycle were grown either in the absence
of any drug or in the presence of 5 μM CQ or 50 nM 2a/2b. Giemsa-stained thin smears were microscopically
examined at 0 h (∼12 h-old parasite), 24 h (∼36 h-old
parasite), and 48 h (∼60 h-old parasite). Compounds 2a, 2b, and CQ arrested the development of
the trophozoite stage, and subsequently, no hemozoin formation was
found in the treated parasite compared to the untreated (cont.) parasite.
Red arrow indicates the hemozoin in the parasite food vacuole.

To show that the antiplasmodial
mechanism of Ac–NDIs may
be because of the inhibition of the hemozoin formation, we decided
to evaluate the binding of the most potent compound 2a with heme using UV–vis spectroscopy. The sequential addition
of small increments of 2a into a constant concentration
of monomeric heme solution of pH 7.5 resulted in a substantial decrease
in the intensity of the Soret band of FPIX (Fe3+) (heme)
at 402 nm (Figure 6a). The resulting absorbance data were corrected for dilution and
then analyzed using nonlinear curve-fitting software to calculate
the equilibrium binding constant of 2a with monomeric
heme. The best fit of the absorbance data was obtained with a 1:1
binding model (Figure 6b), which yielded a Kass (association
constant) value of 0.0497 × 106 M–1 (r2 = 0.991). This result is
in good agreement with the observation of Egan and co-workers that
the 1:1 complex is predominant species in pH 7.5 N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) buffer containing 40% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).84 Importantly, the association constant value
of 2a at pH 7.4 (log Kass 4.70) is close to the reported value of the standard antimalarial
drug CQ (log Kass 5.15).85

The interaction of the Ac67,81 and NDI41−46 derivatives with DNA is well documented, and it is generally suggested
that this interaction affects the activity of DNA metabolic enzymes
such as topoisomerases. Recently, molecules such as quinone cyanine-dithiazole
and thiazole-coumarin-based cell permeable fluorescence/NIR-fluorescence
turn-ON probes specific toward AT-rich DNA were successfully applied
for selective staining of the nucleus of an organism having an AT-rich
genome, such as P. falciparum.86,87 In this context, it is noteworthy that the conjugate 2a failed to exhibit any significant interaction with DNA in UV–visible
spectroscopy studies. The gradual addition of calf thymus (CT) DNA
(0–7 × 10–4 M) to 2a (∼6
× 10–5 M) solution [3:1 MeOH:trisethelenediaminetetraacetic
acid (TE) buffer (pH 8)] produced no significant changes in the absorption
intensity as well as in the λmax of 2a (Figure S6). This noninteraction with
DNA can be attributed to the bulkier size of conjugate molecule 2a, which may not allow the Ac ring or NDI core to intercalate
in between DNA base pairs. However, we were unable to employ a higher
concentration of 2a in the DNA interaction study by UV–visible
spectroscopy because of precipitation.

Next, we evaluated the
redox potential of orthogonal Ac–NDI 1a and the
most potent 2a with the aid of cyclic
voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) (Figure 7). Both molecules
exhibited two well-separated reversible reduction waves. Molecules1a and 2a showed first reduction potentials (Ered1) at −0.48 and −0.51 V, respectively, and second reduction
potentials (Ered2) at −0.98 and −0.95 V, respectively,
versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). From the comparison
of Ered1 values of 2a with 1a, it becomes
clearly evident that the linker between Ac and NDI decreases the π
acidity of the NDI core in 2a, which leads to the cathodically
shifted reduction potential of 2a.

(CVs) of 1a and 2a in DMF with n-Bu4NPF6 as
the electrolyte and a saturated calomel reference electrode, platinum
working electrode, and auxiliary electrode.

Biological reductants such as glutathione (GSH) and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) play pivotal role in maintaining
the redox balance (redox homeostasis) in the parasite by providing
reducing equivalents to the biosynthetic reactions involved in neutralizing
ROS. Therefore, the depletion of these essential biological reductants
inside of the parasite would cause the disruption of redox balance
of the parasite, which in turn leads to the death of the parasite.
The successful electrochemical reduction of Ac–en–NDI
conjugate 2a prompted us to determine whether 2a could be reduced in the presence of biological reductants. Sulfide
(S2–) was chosen as a model biological reductant
for our study because of its favorable solubility in DMF over GSH;
however, both S2– and GSH have more positive physiological
half-cell reaction reduction potentials88 ∼+0.17, ∼−0.25 V, respectively, compared to 2a. UV–visible spectroscopy of 2a exhibited
two strong absorption peaks at 361 and 378 nm because of the π–π*
transitions for the NDI core. In the presence of S2–, new signature peaks, characteristic of the radical anion 2a•–, appeared at 475, 607, 682, and 757 nm with
a concomitant decrease of the π–π* 361 and 378
nm bands (Figure 8).
These absorption bands as a result of the D0 → Dn transitions corroborated the reduction of
the NDI core. This result suggests that conjugate 2a has
a potential to interact with the biological reductant present in the
parasite because of its redox property and thereby disrupt the redox
balance of the parasite.

of 2a (5
× 10–5) upon incremental addition of S2– (0–8 equiv) in DMF.

Owing to the similarity of redox properties of the NDI scaffold
present in the Ac–NDI conjugate with mETC inhibitor atovaquone,
we anticipated that Ac–NDIs may also interfere with the mETC
and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. We therefore examined whether 2a could lead to the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential
(ΔΨm) in parasites. The ΔΨm was determined using a membrane-potential-sensitive dye,
JC-1, also known as 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimida-zolocarbocyanine
iodide. JC-1 emits green fluorescence at 525 nm in its monomeric form.
However, upon accumulation into intact healthy mitochondria with higher
ΔΨm, it forms J aggregate and exhibits orange-red
fluorescence at 590 nm. JC-1 accumulation would be less in the damaged
mitochondria with low ΔΨm and does not form
aggregates because of its less availability and exhibits weak fluorescence
at 590 nm. Synchronized midring-stage parasites (∼18 h p.i)
were incubated with 2a for 12, 24, and 36 h prior to
30 min incubation with JC-1. Fluorescence microscopic studies were
carried out to measure the JC-1 accumulation (ΔΨm) in the presence or absence of 2a. In the control (untreated)
parasites, ΔΨm increased as the parasite progressed
from ring to trophozoite (12 h) and schizont (24 h) stages. However,
ΔΨm decreased dramatically as the parasites
reached the next cycle (36 h) (Figure 9). The ΔΨm value is proportional
to the size of the mitochondrion, which increases gradually from ring
to trophozoite and schizont stages. Further, the ratios of J aggregates
to the monomer in the control (no drug) parasites were higher compared
to those of parasites treated with 2a for 12, 24, and
36 h (Figure 9). The
observed red fluorescence (J aggregates) in parasites treated with 2a (25 and 50 nM) for 12, 24, and 36 h was almost negligible
or null compared to that in control parasites. Moreover, a minimum
12 h exposure to 25 nM 2a was sufficient enough to disrupt
the mitochondrial membrane potential as a considerably less amount
of J-aggregate (red fluorescence) formation was observed within 12
h of exposure of 25 nM 2a. These results clearly indicate
that Ac–NDI conjugate 2a disrupts the mitochondrial
membrane potential in the malaria parasite and also suggest that mitochondrion
is one of the targeting sites.

Panels I, III, and V stand for the J aggregate (emission, 590 nm)/JC-1
monomer (emission, 525 nm) (merged). Panels II, IV, and VI stand for
DIC + merged. High ΔΨm in control mitochondria
causes the J aggregation of JC-1, which leads to red-orange fluorescence.
An exposure of parasites to 2a leads to a significant
decrease in J-aggregate formation as indicated by a switch of red-orange
fluorescence (control, I) to green fluorescence (treated, III and
IV), demonstrating a collapse of ΔΨm. The scale
bar is 2 μm.

Conclusions
In
this investigation, we have conjugated for the first time Ac
and NDI pharmacophores through a facile condensation approach of primary
amines with acid anhydride. These Ac–NDI conjugates were found
to provide a new class of redox-active, electronically segmented NDI-based
bifunctional antimalarial molecules against CQ-sensitive and CQ-resistant
strains of P. falciparum. The in vitro
evaluation of these conjugates against Pf 3D7 and Pf W2 strains depicted the activity of orthogonal Ac–NDI
series (1a–e) in a micromolar to
submicromolar range and flexible Ac–en–NDI series (2a–c and 3) in a nanomolar
range. Amongst the flexible Ac–en–NDI molecules, 2a and 2b were found to be most potent with IC50 values of 3.65 and 4.33 nM, respectively, against Pf 3D7. Significantly, against the Pf W2
strain, 2a and 2b exhibited IC50 values of 52.20 and 28.53 nM, respectively, which were around 1
order of magnitude better than those of the standard drug CQ. The
SAR studies revealed that the amino ethyl spacer between Ac and NDI
pharmacophores was critical to exhibit potent antiplasmodial activity.
The evaluation of theoretical physicochemical properties suggested
that conjugates 2a and 2b were almost compliant
with Lipinski’s rule of five with no. of violations two and
one, respectively. Also, these potent conjugates were found to be
low cytotoxic against mammalian cell lines. Further, to shed light
on the MOA of these hybrids, our data suggests that (i) Ac–NDI
binds to free heme, which may lead to an inhibition of hemozoin formation,
(ii) the NDI scaffold in the conjugate molecule can uptake electrons
from biological reductants, which may cause a depletion of essential
biological reducing equivalents inside of the parasite and thereby
affecting the redox equilibrium of the parasite, and (iii) Ac–NDI
causes the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Therefore,
the proposed antiplasmodial MOA of these molecules is quite distinct
from that of CQ- and Ac-based antimalarials and also clearly suggests
that the biofunctional activity of these Ac–NDI conjugates
to produce antimalarial activity. Overall, our data demonstrate that
the NDI scaffold in the Ac–NDI bifunctional molecule plays
significant role(s) in intervening various biological pathways leading
to the parasitic death.

In Vitro Parasite
Culture
P. falciparum strain
3D7 (CQ-sensitive) and W2 (CQ-resistant) (asexual stages)
were cultured in human erythrocytes (O+). The infected
erythrocytes were maintained in a RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
0.2% NaHCO3, 0.5% Albumax-II (lipid-rich bovine serum albumin),
gentamycin sulfate (10 μg/mL), and hypoxanthine (27 mg/L) under
a gas mixture of 90% N2, 5% CO2, and 5% O2 at 37 °C. These parasites were used for in vitro antimalarial
activity assay.

Drug Treatment of the In Vitro Cultured Parasites
The
details of stock solutions of all of the drugs and their highest tested
concentration are noted in Table S2. All
of the DMSO stock solutions were stored at RT and used within 15 days.
CQ stock solutions was stored at 4 °C and used within 15 days.
For the assay, stock compounds were further diluted in serum-free
culture media, and then, serial 2-fold dilutions of each compound
were made using complete media in a 24 well plate from their respective
highest tested concentration X (mentioned in Table S2) to give respective Y no. of concentrations (mentioned in Table S2) that would be tested. The final DMSO concentration in the wells
with the highest drug concentration was not more that 1%, which had
no measurable effect on the parasite viability (data not shown). An
aliquot of the synchronized ring-stage (8–12 h p.i) culture
(Pf 3D7 or Pf W2) was added to each
well of the plates preloaded with serial dilution of drugs to achieve
1% parasitemia and 4% hematocrit. The final culture volume was 1 mL
in each well. Each plate had a vehicle (DMSO), positive control drug
CQ, and only uninfected RBCs. The plates were kept in a closed chamber
under a gas mixture of 5% O2, 5% CO2, and 90%
N2, and the chamber was incubated at 37 °C for ∼72
h. After completion of the incubation time (drug exposure), the plates
were stored at −80 °C. All tests were conducted in duplicate,
and the experiments were reproduced twice.

SYBR Green I Assay for
IC50 Determination
In vitro antimalarial activity
(IC50) was assessed using
SYBR Green I assay, an adaptation of the protocols reported elsewhere.61 The Plasmodium cultured plates (24 well) were taken out from −80 °C
and thawed completely at RT, and then, each sample was mixed by pipetting.
Then, a total volume of 100 μL of lysed culture from each sample
was transferred to a new flat-bottom 96 well plate. SYBR Green I in
lysis buffer (100 μL) (0.2 μL SYBR Green I/mL lysis buffer;
composition of lysis buffer: Tris 200 mM (pH 7.5), EDTA (5 mM), saponin
(0.008% w/v), and Triton X-100 (0.08% w/v)) was added to each well.
The plates were incubated in the dark at RT for ∼2 h, and fluorescence
counts from each well were measured from the bottom of the plate using
a Thermo Varioskan plate reader at excitation and emission wave lengths
of 485 and 535 nm, respectively. The background reading for an empty
well was subtracted using accompanying Varioskan software to afford
fluorescence counts for analysis. The IC50 values were
determined using GraphPad Prism 6 software by fitting the fluorescence
counts from all of the test samples in a nonlinear dose–response
curve fitting analysis.

Stage-Specific Effects of Compounds and Morphological
Analysis
Specific stages of the synchronized culture (ring,
trophozoite,
and schizont) were treated with compounds for 12 h and then washed
to remove the drug followed by resuspension in complete media to complete
one life cycle. In parallel, a 36 h (whole cycle) treatment of compounds
was given to synchronized ring-stage parasites (∼12 h). The
growth of the parasites in each sample (after completion of one cycle)
was measured by fluorescence-based SYBR Green I assay. The growth
of the triplicate sample with SEM of each stage was plotted against
the different concentration of compounds to yield a stage-specific
inhibition profile of compounds.

For morphological analysis
of antimalarial action or monitoring the growth of hemozoin, samples
were taken out from the synchronized ring (∼8–12 h p.i)
treated with drugs and untreated culture at different time intervals,
and Giemsa-stained parasite pictures were captured using a Nikon light
microscope.
