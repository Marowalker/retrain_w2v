Efficient
analytical representations of the thermodynamic properties
for carbon disulfide remain open challenges in the communality of
science and engineering. We present two analytical representations
of the entropy and Gibbs free energy for gaseous carbon disulfide
which we find to be of satisfactory accuracy and convenient for future
use. The proposed two analytical representations merely rely on five
molecular constants of the carbon disulfide molecule and avoid applications
of a large number of experimental spectroscopy data. In the temperature
range from 300 to 6000 K, the average relative deviations of the predicted
molar entropy and reduced Gibbs free energy values from the National
Institute of Standards and Technology database are 0.250 and 0.108%,
respectively.

1 Introduction
Reduced sulfur species, including carbon disulfide (CS2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbonyl sulfide (OCS) as
trace sulfur gases exist in most atmospheric and surface natural water
samples, and play a role in the global climate change.1,2 CS2 originates widely from the combustion process of
coal and natural gas, and also originates from industrial processes,
such as production of insecticides and manmade cellulose.3−5 The CS2 radical has long been used as a starting material
for production of a variety of useful chemicals for agricultural,
medicinal, and pharmaceutical applications. The chemical properties
and real applications of the CS2 radical have drawn much
recent interest.6−18 However, as far as we know, the questions of what are efficient
analytical representations of thermodynamic quantities for CS2, including entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy, remain
to be solved from the view of the first principles. Knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of substances is essential
for understanding natural phenomena such as phase transition, chemical
reaction, and adsorption,19−25 and for the engineering design of industrial processes. Providing
efficient analytical representations of thermodynamic quantities for
triatomics still remains elusive in the communality of science and
engineering.

Our overall strategy for constructing effective
analytical representations
of thermodynamic quantities relies on exploiting the available oscillators
to describe internal vibrations of the CS2 molecule. Recent
work from our group on establishing efficient closed-form representations
of entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy for diatomic substances
has been performed by taking advantage of the improved Rosen–Morse,
Manning–Rosen, and Tietz oscillators to represent the internal
vibration of a diatomic molecule.26−35 Inspired by this work, as well as the importance of the applications
for CS2, we further design efficient analytical representations
of the thermodynamic quantities for triatomic substances such as carbon
disulfide. The purpose of the present study is to establish two analytical
representations for the molar entropy and Gibbs free energy of CS2. To evaluate the ability of the proposed prediction models,
we utilize five molecular constants of CS2 as an input
to determine the molar entropy and Gibbs free energy values in the
temperature range from 298 to 6000 K, and compare the predicted values
with the experimental data available in the literature.

2 Results and Discussion
In order to ascertain the validity
of the proposed models, the
molar entropy and reduced Gibbs free energy are plotted against temperature
as shown in Figure 1, where five molecular constant values for the CS2 molecule
are taken from the work reported by Wentink7 and Yang et al.:8De = 35 986.98 cm–1, reCS = 1.553 Å, ωes = 671.4 cm–1, ωea = 1551.9 cm–1, and ωeb = 398.6 cm–1. The reduced
Gibbs free energy is defined as Gr = −(G – H298.15)/T. In Figure 1A, the green solid line stands for the theoretical entropy values
predicted by using the improved Tietz oscillator to describe the symmetric
stretching vibration of the CS2 molecule, the red solid
line represents the entropy values obtained by using the traditional
harmonic oscillator to describe the symmetric stretching vibration,
and blue solid circles indicate the experimental data from the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database.36 We can observe from Figure 1A that the molar entropy values based on
the pure harmonic oscillator to represent the vibrations possess large
deviations from the experimental data. All the data predicted from
expressions 13 and 14,
in the temperature range of 300–6000 K, are in good agreement
with the experimental data from the NIST database.36 The average relative deviations from the NIST data for
the entropy and reduced Gibbs free energy values of CS2 are 0.250 and 0.108%, respectively. These deviation values strongly
suggest that the proposed analytical representations of the entropy
and Gibbs free energy for gaseous carbon disulfide are efficient in
the temperature range from 300 to 6000 K.

and (B) molar reduced Gibbs free energy.

Conventional calculation models for the thermodynamic quantities
of substances are required to apply a great number of experimental
spectroscopy data. The present analytical representations of entropy
and Gibbs free energy for CS2 merely require experimental
values of five molecular constants of the CS2 molecule.
This merit may stimulate one to develop analytical representations
of thermodynamic quantities for other triatomics with the help of
the present methodology.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, we first construct reliable analytical representations
of entropy and Gibbs free energy for gaseous carbon disulfide from
the first principles. The average relative deviations of entropy and
reduced Gibbs free energy values for CS2 from the NIST
database, in the temperature range of 300–6000 K, are 0.250
and 0.108%, respectively. The proposed analytical representations
merely rely on experimental values of five molecular constants of
the CS2 molecule. The compromise of the simplicity and
accuracy of the proposed analytical representations provide a new
path toward construction of analytical expressions of thermodynamic
quantities for other triatomic systems.

4 Computational
Methods
The CS2 molecule is a linear triatomic
molecule. As
shown in Figure 2,
the CS2 molecule has four vibration modes, including internal
symmetric stretching vibration, antisymmetric stretching vibration,
and a degenerate pair of bending vibrations. Herein, the improved
Tietz oscillator37 is used to illustrate
the symmetric stretching vibration of the CS2 molecule.
The vibrational partition function to represent the symmetric stretching
mode of CS2 is given from eq 14 of ref (28) as follows 1  where De represents
the energy to dissociate CS2 into CS and
S, k denotes the Boltzmann constant, T denotes the absolute temperature, , , , , , and , here h denotes the Planck
constant, μSS is the reduced mass of two sulfur atoms, reSS = 2reCS, reCS stands for the C–S equilibrium distance, q is a dimensionless adjustable parameter. The symbol ±
corresponds to two cases that the plus is chosen when q < 0 and the minus is taken if q > 0. The
parameter
α is determined by , here , c represents
the speed
of light and ωes stands for the symmetric stretching
frequency. The symbol erfi denotes the imaginary error function. The
factor e2/3 illustrates the contributions of the excited
states of the CS2 molecule to the vibrational partition
function. The symbol vmax represents the
highest vibrational quantum number which is given by   where [x] denotes the greatest
integer, which is less than x for the noninteger x.

Figure 2 Schematic diagram of the vibration modes of the CS2 molecule.

To tackle the problems
of the antisymmetric stretching vibration
and bending vibrations of the CS2 molecule, we choose the
harmonic oscillator and write the corresponding vibrational partition
function as follows28 2  where Θv = hcωe/k, ωe represents
the equilibrium frequency.

The vibrational entropy and Gibbs
free energy corresponding to
four vibration modes can be deduced from the following thermodynamic
relationships and expressions 1 and 2 3   4  

The molar vibrational
entropy and Gibbs free energy accompanied
by contributions of the symmetric stretching vibration of CS2 are determined as follows, respectively 5   6  where  represents the universal gas constant.
The molar vibrational entropy and Gibbs free energy accompanied by
contributions of the antisymmetric stretching vibration and two bending
vibrations of CS2 can be yielded as follows, respectively 7   8  where Θva = hcωea/k, Θvb = hcωeb/k, ωea, and
ωeb represent the antisymmetric
stretching vibration and bending vibration frequencies of CS2, respectively.

The molar entropies accompanied by contributions
of translation
and rotation of CS2 are given by eqs 9 and 10,38 respectively 9   10  where , mCS2 denotes the mass of the CS2 molecule, μCS denotes the reduced mass of
carbon and sulfur atoms, and P denotes the gas pressure.
The molar Gibbs free energies
corresponding to translation and rotation of CS2 are expressed
as follows,39 respectively 11   12  

The total
molar entropy and Gibbs free energy of CS2 are obtained
from eqs 5–12 as follows, respectively 13   14  

When we know the experimental values of De, reCS, ωes,
ωea, and ωeb for CS2,
the molar entropy and Gibbs free energy values can be easily predicted
from eqs 13 and 14. Here, we establish the quantitative relationships
between the entropy and Gibbs free energy of CS2 and the
basic molecular constants. Keeping the pressure invariant, the temperature
dependence of the entropy and Gibbs free energy of CS2 can
be simply depicted in terms of eqs 13 and 14.
