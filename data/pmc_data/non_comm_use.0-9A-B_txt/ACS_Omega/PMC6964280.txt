The chromate nanoparticles such as CoCr2O4, NiCr2O4, CuCr2O4, and ZnCr2O4 were prepared by a modified sol–gel
method. The structural and morphological properties of the chromate
nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and a
scanning electron microscope (SEM). The catalytic effects of chromates
on the thermal decomposition of fine ammonium perchlorate (FAP) and
hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) were studied by the TG-DTG measurements.
Results show that the addition of CoCr2O4, NiCr2O4, CuCr2O4, and ZnCr2O4 nanoparticles makes the activation energies
for the thermal decomposition of FAP decrease by 93.9, 94.0, 83.1,
and 67.0 kJ·mol–1, and the thermal decomposition
temperatures decrease by 45.0, 24.9, 57.7, and 38.8 K respectively.
On the other hand, a similar trend exists in the case of the thermal
decomposition of CL-20. Therefore, the addition of nanochromates shows
high catalytic efficiency on the thermal decomposition of both FAP
and CL-20 components, which would be beneficial to promote the burning
rate of propellants containing FAP and CL-20 components.

==== Body
Introduction
As one of the most important propellants,
the high burning rate solid rocket propellant has been extensively
used in terms of operational rockets, missiles, satellites, and space
shuttle launch vehicles. Many efforts have been devoted for developing
novel propellants with high burning rate to fulfill the ever-growing
and challenging requirements.1−3 The burning rate can be tuned
by the addition of high energetic materials, combustion catalysts,
and even by adjusting the particle size of oxidizers in the solid
rocket propellants.4−7 In particular, chromate as a transition metal combustion catalyst
is capable of increasing the burning rate of solid propellants.8−14 Ammonium perchlorate (AP) with the particle size of about 1 μm,
namely, fine AP (FAP), has been widely used as an oxidizer to promote
the burning rate of composite propellants.15,16 On the other hand, hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), a novel
high explosive, has aroused great concerns to be used as a high energetic
additive to improve the energy of composite propellants.17,18

It is well known that the combustion behavior of the composite
propellant depends heavily on the thermal decomposition of both AP
and CL-20. As thus, tuning the thermal decomposition of above two
components by the addition of catalysts suggests great potential strategies
to modify the combustion properties of composite propellants. The
catalytic effects of transition metal oxides on the thermal decomposition
of AP have been well studied,19−24 whereas mixed metal oxides were less studied.25 On the other hand, the catalytic effects of simple transition
metal oxides or mixed metal oxides on the thermal decomposition of
CL-20 were seldom reported. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge,
the catalytic effects of nanochromates on the thermal decomposition
of both FAP and CL-20 have rarely been reported.

In this work,
chromate nanoparticles such as CoCr2O4, NiCr2O4, CuCr2O4, and ZnCr2O4 were prepared by a sol–gel method, and
their structural and morphological properties were characterized by
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM),
respectively. The catalytic effects of chromate nanoparticles on the
thermal decomposition of both FAP and CL-20 were studied by the TG-DTG
measurements and well discussed.

Results and Discussion
XRD Analysis
The chemical compositions of chromate
nanoparticles were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Figure 1, all the main XRD
peaks were indexed for the planes accordingly, and those diffraction
peaks of these chromate nanoparticles were well consistent with those
standard JCPDS cards of CoCr2O4 (no. 22-1084),26,27 NiCr2O4 (no. 89-6615),28 CuCr2O4 (no. 34-0424),29,30 and ZnCr2O4 (no. 22-1107),31,32 respectively. For example, the diffraction peaks at 2θ angles
from Figure 1d appeared
30.41°, 35.75°, 37.44°, 43.49°, 53.91°, 57.35°,
and 62.95° could be assigned for scattering from the (2 2 0),
(3 1 1), (2 2 2), (4 0 0), (4 2 2), (5 1 1), and (4 4 0) planes, respectively,
which were well matched with the XRD patterns of the spinel crystal
lattice of ZnCr2O4 (no. 22-1107).31,32 Notably, the diffraction peaks of the samples were so distinct that
good crystallity and high purity of objective samples were facilely
prepared. Moreover, after comparison with corresponding XRD patterns
and reference spectra, XRD studies confirmed the absence of reactant
oxides of Co2O3 (no. 73-1701), NiO (no. 73-1519),
CuO (no. 48-1548), and ZnO (no. 36-1541), respectively.33−39 Besides, all the calcined production displayed prominent peaks and
an increased peak width in XRD patterns suggesting that the chromate
nanoparticles fabricated by the sol–gel approach possessed
rather small crystallite sizes. Furthermore, the crystallite sizes
of these nanochromates were calculated from their corresponding XRD
peak broadening of the most intense diffraction peak (3 1 1) using
the Scherrer formula, D = Kλ/βcosθ,
and the average crystallite sizes of CoCr2O4, NiCr2O4, CuCr2O4, and
ZnCr2O4 nanoparticles were determined as 22.0,
23.4, 23.4, and 22.7 nm, respectively.

nanoparticles: (a) nano-CoCr2O4, (b) nano-NiCr2O4, (c) nano-CuCr2O4, and
(d) nano-ZnCr2O4.

SEM Analysis
The morphologies of chromates were observed
by SEM, as shown in Figure 2. The SEM image of CoCr2O4 displays
a uniform distribution of spherical particles with particle size in
the ranges of 20–50 nm after calcination. Both NiCr2O4 and CuCr2O4 show cubic morphologies
with particle sizes ranging from 20 to 60 nm. The larger sizes shown
in SEM than those calculated by the Scherrer equation are due to the
agglomeration of nanoparticles. ZnCr2O4 nanoparticles
show an irregular particle shape and much more agglomeration than
other chromate.

Optimization of Experimental Conditions
To synthesize
the CuCr2O4 nanoparticles in high purity, we
studied the effects of several factors such as the ratio of the raw
materials, pH values, as well as the calcined temperatures used in
the synthesis of CuCr2O4. Table 1 shows the constitution of products by varying
the Cu/Cr mole ratios. Notably, to obtain the pure CuCr2O4, the mole ratio of Cu(NO3)2 and
Cr(NO3)3 has to be fixed at 0.5.

Table 1 Influence of Cu/Cr Mole Ratio on the
Constitution of Product
n(Cu):n(Cr)/R	R < 0.5	R = 0.5	0.5 < R < 1	R = 1	
constitution	CuCr2O4-Cr2O3	CuCr2O4	CuCr2O4-CuO-CuCrO2	CuCrO2	
Also, the pH value in the sol–gel process plays
a crucial role on the constitution of products. To study the effects
of the pH value, the mole ratio of raw materials was maintained constant
at 0.5, and the calcined temperature was set at 820 °C. The citric
acid was used as the complexing agent. Table 2 shows the purity of copper chromate products
as a function of pH value.

Table 2 Influence of pH on the Purity of Products
pH	7–8	8–9	9–10	10–11	11–12	
purity (%)	50	55	70	100	80	
It is found that the purity of the product increases
with the increase in the pH value and reaches 100% at the pH values
of 10–11. Then, the purity of the product decreases to 80%
when increasing the pH values to 11–12. It is believed that
the citric acid combines with the copper and chromium metal ions in
different ratios at different pH values, which leads to the generation
of CuO and Cr2O3 in calcination.

To investigate
the effects of calcined temperature on the particle size of CuCr2O4, the mole ratio of Cu(NO3)2 and Cr(NO3)3 was set at 0.5, and the pH value
was adjusted in the range of 10–11. The citric acid was used
as a complexing agent. Table 3 shows the particle size of chromate nanoparticles obtained
at different calcination temperatures. It is found that the particle
size of chromates decreases with the increase in the calcined temperature,
and the minimum particle size of about 23 nm was achieved at 820 °C.
Based on the above studies, the optimal experimental condition for
the preparation of all chromate nanoparticles can be determined, and
the results are listed in Table 7.

Effect of Chromates on Thermal Decomposition of FAP and CL-20
The DTG curve of FAP shows a single thermal decomposition peak
at 634.5 K without the appearance of crystal transformation, as shown
in Figure 3a. It is
due to the adsorption of a large amount of NH3 and HClO4 gases on the surface of FAP particles. On the other hand, Figure 3b shows that CL-20
decomposes at 520.5 K.

Figure 3 TG-DTG curves of (a) FAP and (b) CL-20.

The TG-DTG curves for FAP and CL-20 containing
chromate catalysts are shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.
As shown in Table 4, the addition of chromate nanoparticles leads to a significant decrease
in the decomposition temperature of FAP. In particular, the addition
of CuCr2O4 leads to the largest decrease in
the decomposition temperature of AP by 57.7 °C, suggesting that
CuCr2O4 has a remarkably higher catalytic efficiency
than that of the other chromates. It is known that most of the transition
metal oxides enable both catalytic decomposition of the perchlorate
ion and oxidation of ammonia. The high catalytic efficiencies of chromate
nanoparticles on the decomposition of AP lie in their large surface
area, numerous Lewis acid sites, as well as the synergetic effects
of the M2+ and Cr3+ in the heterogeneous catalytic
reaction.

nano-CuCr2O4/FAP	576.8	57.7	
nano-ZnCr2O4/FAP	595.7	38.8	
Also, the addition of chromates leads to a slight
decrease in the decomposition temperature of CL-20, as shown in Figure 5 and Table 5. Besides the high Lewis acid
sites, the large surface area and synergetic effect of M2+ and Cr3+, the large number of surface atoms enable formation
of coordinate bonds between chromates and the nitro groups (−NO2), resulting in weakening/breaking of the N–N bond.
Increasing the temperature leads to a fast formation of −NO2 in liquid CL-20, which results in a self-catalysis of CL-20.

nano-CuCr2O4/CL-20	513.7	6.8	
nano-ZnCr2O4/CL-20	513.8	6.7	
The thermal decomposition kinetics was further explored
to study the effect of chromates on the activation energy of thermal
decomposition of FAP and CL-20, respectively. To obtain the kinetic
parameters (the apparent activation energy (E) and
pre-exponential constant (A)) of the exothermic decomposition
reaction for the nanochromates, multiple heating methods (Kissinger’s
method40 and Ozawa’s method41) were employed as follows:

Kissinger’s
equation: 1  

Ozawa’s equation: 2  where Tp is the peak temperature (K), β is
the linear heating rate (K min–1), E is the apparent activation energy (kJ mol–1), A is the pre-exponential constant (s–1), R is the gas constant (J mol–1 K–1), and C is a constant.

The calculated results of the apparent activation energy (Ea) and the apparent pre-exponential factor (A) were tabulated in Table 6. The Ea values of nano-CoCr2O4/FAP, nano-NiCr2O4/FAP,
nano-CuCr2O4/FAP, and nano-ZnCr2O4/FAP were determined by the Kissinger method as 129.5, 129.2,
140.4, and 157.0 kJ·mol–1, respectively, of
which were reduced by 95.8, 96.1, 84.9, and 68.3 kJ·mol–1, respectively, compared with that of FAP (225.3 kJ·mol–1). The results determined by the Ozawa method were
inconsistent with those of the Kissinger method. The same trend was
found in the case of CL-20. Therefore, the addition of chromate nanoparticles
can reduce the activation energy in the thermal decomposition of both
FAP and CL-20, suggesting that chromates allow to increase the burning
rate of propellants containing FAP and CL-20 components.

Conclusions
The chromate nanoparticles such as CoCr2O4, NiCr2O4, CuCr2O4, and ZnCr2O4 were prepared by
a sol–gel method, and their compositional and morphological
properties were studied by XRD and SEM measurements. Moreover, their
catalytic effects on the thermal decomposition of FAP and CL-20 were
studied by using TG-DTG analysis. Specifically, the addition of CoCr2O4, NiCr2O4, CuCr2O4, and ZnCr2O4 nanoparticles induced
an obvious decrease in the activation energy for the thermal decomposition
of FAP and CL-20 as well as the corresponding thermal decomposition
temperatures of FAP and CL-20. Therefore, those reported nanochromates
could be applied as efficient catalysts for the thermal decomposition
of both FAP and CL-20 components, which would benefit the promotion
of the burning rate of propellants containing FAP and CL-20 components.

Experimental Section
Materials
Ammonia aqueous solution at a concentration
of 25 wt % and other raw materials such as chromic nitrate, citric
acid, cupric nitrate, cobalt nitrate, nickel nitrate, and zinc nitrate
with the purities higher than 98% were all purchased from J&K
Chemical Technology.

Instruments and Analysis
An X-ray diffractometer (XRD,
ARL XTRA) was used to analyze the crystallization of chromate nanoparticles.
The size, shape, and structures of chromate were studied using a scanning
electron microscope (SEM, JSM-588).

Preparation of Nanochromates
For the synthesis of CoCr2O4 nanoparticles, 2.9 g of (0.01 mol) Co(NO3)2 and 1.35 g of (0.007 mol) citric acid as surfactants
were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water as solution A. Weights
of 8.0 g of (0.02 mol) Cr(NO3)3 and 3.85 g of
(0.02 mol) citric acid as surfactants were dissolved in 100 mL of
deionized water as solution B. The solutions A and B were then mixed
in a 250 mL four-necked bottle by stirring at 70 °C for 3 h during
which the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 8–9 by an
ammonia solution. After aging for 10 h, the obtained sol solution
was collected and distilled to form gel. The resultant was dried in
an oven and then calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 4
h to obtain the CoCr2O4 nanoparticles.

Similarly, the NiCr2O4, CuCr2O4 and ZnCr2O4 nanoparticles were also
synthesized from each corresponding raw materials, respectively. The
reaction condition of each chromate nanoparticle was shown in Table 7.

Catalytic Experiments
Differential thermal gravity
(DTG) analysis was conducted to measure the mass loss of FAP and CL-20
as functions of temperature under the catalytic effect of chromate
nanoparticles using a TA instrument Q-200. Prior to performing thermal
decomposition, each chromate additive was uniformly mixed with FAP
and CL-20, respectively. The measurements were carried out at the
heating rates of 5, 10, and 20 K min–1 at ambient
pressure in N2 atmosphere (sample mass was 0.5–1.5
mg).
