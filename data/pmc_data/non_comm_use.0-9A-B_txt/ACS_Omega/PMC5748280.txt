Recently, hole-doped GeSe materials
have been predicted to exhibit
extraordinary thermoelectric performance owing largely to extremely
low thermal conductivity. However, experimental research on the thermoelectric
properties of GeSe has received less attention. Here, we have synthesized
polycrystalline Na-doped GeSe compounds, characterized their crystal
structure, and measured their thermoelectric properties. The Seebeck
coefficient decreases with increasing Na content up to x = 0.01 due to an increase in the hole carrier concentration and
remains roughly constant at higher concentrations of Na, consistent
with the electrical resistivity variation. However, the electrical
resistivity is large for all samples, leading to low power factors.
Powder X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive
spectrometry results show the presence of a ternary impurity phase
within the GeSe matrix for all doped samples, which suggests that
the optimal carrier concentration cannot be reached by doping with
Na. Nevertheless, the lattice thermal conductivity and carrier mobility
of GeSe is similar to those of polycrystalline samples of the leading
thermoelectric material SnSe, leading to quality factors of comparable
magnitude. This implies that GeSe shows promise as a thermoelectric
material if a more suitable dopant can be found.

Introduction
Thermoelectric (TE) materials have been
intensively investigated
over the past decades due to their ability to convert waste heat to
electricity, especially in view of the energy crisis and concern for
the environment.1−3 The performance of a TE material is determined by
its dimensionless figure of merit (zT), defined as zT = (S2σT)/κ, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ
is the electrical conductivity, κ is the total thermal conductivity,
and T is the absolute temperature.4−6 There is an
ongoing search for new materials with high TE efficiency, especially
using environmentally friendly and abundant elements, as well as the
development of several approaches to improve the zT of existing materials via optimizing the parameters S, σ, and κ.4,7−10 Chalcogenide compounds have been extensively studied and their TE
performance has shown significant enhancement in recent years.11,12 High thermoelectric performance has recently been reported for single
crystals of SnSe, largely due to their ultralow thermal conductivity.13 High zT values and low thermal
conductivities are also reported in polycrystalline SnSe, but their
power factor values are significantly lower than those of single crystals.14−23 Germanium telluride (GeTe)-based materials have also been widely
studied for their promising thermoelectric properties.24−29 However, germanium selenide (GeSe) has received little attention
for thermoelectric applications despite its use in other applications,
such as optoelectronics,30,31 resistive memory cells,32 glass-forming materials for photonic devices
with thin-film structures,33,34 photovoltaic applications,30 and resistive switching materials.32,35

GeSe is a p-type narrow-band gap semiconductor (Eg = 1.1–1.2 eV)36,37 that adopts
a layered orthorhombic crystal structure at room temperature with
space group Pnma, isostructural
with GeS, SnS, and SnSe.38 Only a few reports
have been published on the transport properties of GeSe; these mostly
focus on the electrical conductivity36,37,39−43 with only two reports on the thermal conductivity of GeSe.44,45 Recently, a theoretical study predicted the thermoelectric performance
of orthorhombic IV–VI compounds GeS, SnSe, SnS, and GeSe using
density functional theory combined with the Boltzmann transport theory.46 It is proposed that GeS, SnS, and GeSe show
thermoelectric properties comparable to those of SnSe, which makes
them promising candidates for high-efficiency thermoelectric applications.46 Another modeling study using similar methods
predicted extremely high thermoelectric performance in hole-doped
GeSe crystals along the b-crystallographic direction,
with a figure of merit ranging from 0.8 at 300 K to 2.5 at 800 K.
This represents an even higher calculated figure of merit than that
of hole-doped SnSe, which holds the current experimental record for
high zT among bulk systems.47 Thus, it is highly desired to experimentally explore the thermoelectric
performance of GeSe-based materials. A recent study45 reports a maximum zT of 0.16 at 700 K
for Ag-doped polycrystalline Ge0.79Ag0.01Sn0.2Se by achieving carrier concentrations of ∼1018 cm–3. Better TE performance is predicted
at higher carrier concentrations, which was impossible to obtain by
silver doping.

In this study, we have fabricated polycrystalline
pristine and
Na-doped GeSe samples and measured their thermoelectric properties.
We have found that the lattice thermal conductivity of our samples
is significantly higher than the ultralow values predicted theoretically47 but at <0.8 W m–1 K–1 above 550 K for the pristine sample is in good agreement
with the previous experimental report in ref (45). Doping with 1 and 2%
Na reduces κ to <0.7 and ∼0.5 W m–1 K–1, respectively, in the same temperature range.
However, the power factors of the Na-doped samples are low due to
the formation of Na-rich precipitates, which prevents optimal carrier
concentrations from being reached. Nevertheless, the measured carrier
mobility of GeSe is comparable with that of SnSe; thus, GeSe may be
a promising thermoelectric material if a more suitable dopant is identified.

Methods
Synthesis
Polycrystalline Ge1–xNaxSe samples with x = 0.00,
0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 were synthesized using a melting technique.
Stoichiometric ratios of high-purity elements, Ge (99.999%, Alfa Aesar),
Se (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), and Na (99%, Aldrich), were weighed in an
argon atmosphere glovebox with a total mass of 10 g and loaded into
carbon-coated quartz tubes. The tubes were sealed under vacuum, slowly
heated to 1223 K, and held at that temperature for 10 h. The samples
were then quenched in cold water, followed by annealing at 673 K for
72 h. The ingots obtained were hand-ground into fine powder using
an agate mortar and pestle and loaded into a 12 mm diameter graphite
die. The powders were then sintered using spark plasma sintering at
623 K for 30 min under an axial pressure of 40 MPa in vacuum.

X-ray
Diffraction (XRD)
X-ray diffraction measurements
were performed using a GBC Scientific X-ray diffractometer with Cu
Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å, 40 kV, 25 mA) at room
temperature. The structural parameters were extracted from the X-ray
diffraction patterns by the Rietveld refinement method using the GSAS
software suite.48

Electron Microscopy Analysis
The microstructures of
the samples were studied using a high-resolution scanning electron
microscope (SEM), JEOL JSM-7001, equipped with an energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometer (EDS).

Transport Properties Measurements
The Hall coefficient
(RH) was measured by an in-house-built
apparatus using the van der Pauw technique (perpendicular to the hot-pressing
direction) in vacuum under magnetic fields of up to ±1.5 T. The
Hall carrier concentration, n, was obtained using n = (1/e)RH, where e is the elementary charge and RH is the Hall coefficient. Disc-shaped pellets with densities
∼94% of the theoretical density, 12 mm diameter, and 2 mm thickness
were used for this measurement. The electrical conductivity (σ)
and Seebeck coefficient (S) were measured simultaneously
under 0.1 atm helium from room temperature to 573 K using a Linseis
LSR-3 instrument. The samples for measurement were cut from pressed
pellets and polished into a parallelepiped shape; measurements were
performed in the in-plane direction. The thermal diffusivity, D, was measured by the laser flash diffusivity method (Linseis
LFA 1000) in the out-of-plane direction over the temperature range
300–573 K. The specific heat capacity (Cp) was calculated using the equation Cp (GeSe, (298.15–940) K) = ((46.777 + 15.099) ×
10–3T – 0.0316 × 10–6T2 – 1.231 ×
105T–2) J K–1 mol–1.49 The thermal
conductivity (κ) was calculated using κ = ρDCp, where the density (ρ) of the pellets
was calculated by measuring the mass and dimensions.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
room temperature powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Ge1–xNaxSe
compounds (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04). The main
peaks of all samples could be indexed on the basis of the orthorhombic
α-GeSe structure, with the unit cell parameters a = 10.8419(9) Å, b = 3.8389(6) Å, and c = 4.3951(7) Å (space group, Pnma). Each primitive unit cell of α-GeSe phase consists
of eight atoms, which form two zigzag double layers. Each atom is
coordinated to three nearest neighbors within its own layer and three
more distant neighbors in adjacent layers; there is weak van der Waals
bonding between adjacent layers and strong covalent interactions within
the layers.39,50,51 This phase is reported to transform to the high-symmetry cubic rocksalt
structure (Fm3̅m, β-GeSe)
at a temperature of 853 K (a = 5.73 Å).52−54 The unit cell parameters do not change (within error bars) on doping.
X-ray diffraction analysis was performed on powders and pellets. For
powder samples there is strong preferred orientation along the [100]
direction (that is, the layer stacking direction in the crystallites
tends to be perpendicular to the sample surface), which makes the
400 peak very strong. A similar degree of preferred orientation was
observed in the X-ray diffraction patterns of the pellets, as shown
in Figure 1b. This
implies that the thermal conductivity was measured more along the a-direction, whereas the electrical resistivity and Seebeck
coefficient measurements were performed largely in the bc-plane. Microstructural analysis of lightly and heavily doped GeSe
samples was conducted by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 2a,b shows representative
back-scattered electron (BSE) images of Ge0.99Na0.01Se and Ge0.96Na0.04Se, respectively. Precipitates
are distributed in the GeSe matrix for both samples. The precipitates
appear to vary in size and concentration with respect to the Na concentration.
Precipitates of <1 μm are most common in Ge0.99Na0.01Se, whereas those observed in Ge0.96Na0.04Se are typically 1–5 μm in size. The concentration
of precipitates also appears to be increased for Ge0.96Na0.04Se.

Ge0.96Na0.04Se. A secondary phase (darker gray)
is observed in the GeSe matrix (lighter gray). (c) EDS characterization:
BSE images of Ge0.96Na0.04Se showing a secondary
phase within the GeSe matrix, with EDS elemental mapping for Ge, Se,
and Na. The secondary phase appears to be higher in Na and Se concentration
and lower in Ge concentration than the surrounding GeSe matrix.

To probe the chemical composition
of the secondary phase, energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping was used. Figure 2c shows the EDS elemental map of precipitates
within the GeSe matrix for the Ge0.96Na0.04Se
sample. The precipitates are richer in Na and Se and poorer in Ge
than the matrix, suggesting that sodium doping induces the formation
of a ternary sodium germanium selenide as a secondary phase. The concentration
of precipitates is too low to give rise to extra peaks in the XRD
patterns; thus, the phase could not be identified.

Figure 3a shows
the total thermal conductivity, κt, of the Ge1–xNaxSe
(x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04) compounds as a function
of temperature in the range of 300–573 K. The thermal conductivity
for all samples decreases with temperature. The thermal conductivity
of the undoped sample is 1.57 W m–1 K–1 at 300 K, which is reduced to 0.76 W m–1 K–1 at 573 K. This is significantly lower than the previously
measured values in polycrystalline samples of 2.2 and 1.3 W m–1 K–1 at 300 and 573 K, respectively,
in ref (44) but comparable
to the values of 1.8 and 0.8 W m–1 K–1 reported in ref (45) at the same temperatures. We note that the Dulong–Petit approximation
of the specific heat capacity was used for GeSe in ref (45); if used for our samples,
the thermal conductivity plotted in Figure 3a would be ∼10% lower at 573 K. Figure 3a also shows that
the total thermal conductivity decreases with increasing dopant concentration
and that samples with precipitates possess much lower thermal conductivity
than lightly doped samples. The lattice thermal conductivity (Figure 3b) was obtained by
subtracting the electronic contribution, κe, from
the measured total thermal conductivity κL = κt – κe. The value of κe can be estimated via the Wiedemann–Franz law, κe = LσT, where σ
is the electrical conductivity and L is the Lorenz
number, which was calculated by using a single parabolic band model
with the acoustic phonon scattering assumption.55 These estimated lattice thermal conductivities are compared
with the previously predicted47 and measured45 values in Figure 3b. The results indicate that the lattice thermal conductivity
is the predominant part of the total thermal conductivity in agreement
with the low carrier concentration of ∼2 × 1016 cm–3 obtained by Hall effect measurement for the
pristine sample at room temperature and indicating that the electronic
contribution to the total thermal conductivity is negligible (∼10–6–10–5 W m–1 K–1). However, the lattice thermal conductivity
of the undoped sample is higher than the extraordinarily low values
of ∼0.6 and 0.4 W m–1 K–1 predicted for GeSe along the b-axis47 at 300 and 573 K, respectively. The lattice
thermal conductivity is reduced with Na content up to x = 0.04, for which we measure κL = 0.44 W m–1 K–1 at 573 K. This originates from
the scattering of phonons at an increased density of interfaces and
defects due to the distribution of precipitates within the matrix.56,57 Such a decrease in κL has also been observed for
Ag-doped GeSe,45 although the possible
presence of precipitates was not investigated in that study. Similarly,
the alloying of 5% GeSe and 5% GeS with GeTe led to a reduction in
κL by almost 50% compared to that of pristine GeTe;
although large precipitates of several microns in size were observed,
the reduction in κL was attributed mostly to point
defects and mass fluctuations.58

Figure 3 (a) Measured
total thermal conductivity, κt, of
Ge1–xNaxSe (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04) in the temperature
range 300–573 K. (b) Calculated lattice thermal conductivity,
κL, of Ge1–xNaxSe (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02,
and 0.04) compared with theoretical values47 calculated along the b-axis and experimental values
from ref (45).

In the calculations of thermal
conductivity in ref (47), charge carrier concentrations
of (4–6.5) × 1019 cm–3 were
used because this range is predicted to yield optimal zT. The electronic component of the thermal conductivity κe remains small for this range of carrier concentration, of
the order of 0.2 W m–1 K–1 at
600 K; thus, the calculations predict that the total thermal conductivity
of GeSe should be even lower than that of SnSe. This would result
in an extremely high predicted figure of merit of 2.1 at 600 K.47 However, our results suggest that the predicted
values for thermal conductivity47 are underestimated
unless the optimal carrier concentration can be reached while also
maintaining a distribution of precipitates.

Table 1 compares
the room temperature transport properties of Na-doped polycrystalline
GeSe in our study compared to those of Na-doped polycrystalline GeSe
in another recent experimental report45 in which pellets with preferred orientation comparable to our samples
were measured using the same geometry. The thermal conductivities
of the low-doped samples are very similar, but our study yields lower
thermal conductivity for heavily doped samples. The electrical resistivity
of our samples is much lower than the reported values in ref (45) for samples with the same
composition (Ge0.98Na0.02Se and Ge0.96Na0.04Se).

The electrical resistivity
of the Ge1–xNaxSe samples with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02, and
0.04 is shown as a function of temperature
in the range 300–580 K in Figure 4a. The electrical resistivity decreases monotonically
with temperature for all samples and remains roughly constant at temperatures
above 450 K. At room temperature, sodium doping reduces the electrical
resistivity of GeSe significantly from 1.0 × 106 mΩ
cm for the undoped sample to 7.9 × 104 mΩ cm
for x = 0.01, roughly by a factor of 12. However,
further doping beyond x = 0.01 has no beneficial
effect; the electrical resistivity of the x = 0.02
and 0.04 samples is slightly higher, probably because the doping limit
is soon reached and additional sodium is incorporated into the precipitate
phase. The Seebeck coefficients (S) of all samples
as a function of the temperature are shown in Figure 4b. The positive values over the entire temperature
range indicate that all samples are p-type semiconductors. The Seebeck
coefficients increase with temperature over the whole temperature
range except for the undoped sample that exhibits a maximum value
at ∼450 K. The so-called bipolar effect, the increasing contribution
of minority carriers to the transport properties with temperature
due to thermal excitation across the band gap,59 is commonly observed in narrow-band gap materials. Although
our samples show no sign of a bipolar effect over the temperature
range in which measurements were performed (300–580 K), we
note that a bipolar effect was observed at temperatures above 600
K in a previous work on GeSe.45 Because
the band gap of GeSe is relatively wide (∼1.1 eV36,37), at temperatures below 600 K, the probability of thermal excitation
of the electrons to the conduction band is low, which results in suppression
of the bipolar effect in this range of temperatures. Undoped GeSe
shows the largest Seebeck coefficient (S = 990 μV
K–1) at 450 K. The Seebeck coefficient is smallest
throughout the studied temperature range for the x = 0.01 sample, whereas the x = 0.02 and 0.04 samples
exhibit similar and slightly larger values, which is consistent with
the variation of the electrical resistivity because both the Seebeck
coefficient and electrical resistivity are inversely proportional
to the carrier concentration. This indicates that the carrier concentration
increases with dopant concentration up to x = 0.01,
beyond which it remains roughly constant. This result is in agreement
with the SEM analysis where the concentration of precipitates is shown
to increase with dopant concentration (Figure 2).

coefficient of Ge1–xNaxSe (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04)

It was first proposed by Chasmar and Stratton60 that to achieve a higher figure of merit in
a thermoelectric
semiconducting compound, a material parameter known as the thermoelectric
quality factor, B, must be improved. The quality
factor can be used to evaluate the performance of a thermoelectric
material through the combination of several fundamental parameters.60−65  Here, kB is the
Boltzmann constant, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, NV is the band degeneracy, mb* is the density
of states effective mass of a single band, μ0 is
the mobility at the nondegenerate limit, T is the
temperature, and κL is the lattice thermal conductivity.
The potential of doped GeSe compounds as good thermoelectric materials
can be evaluated by comparing the quality factor of undoped GeSe with
that of SnSe, assuming similar band structures. Table 2 shows the quality factors estimated for
polycrystalline GeSe and SnSe at 580 K and the parameters used (or
ranges of parameters in cases where a quantity has been reported in
more than one study). Here, we assume that the measured values of
mobility correspond to μ0 at the nondegenerate limit,
which has been shown for SnSe to be a valid approximation.15 Taking into account the large uncertainty in
these parameters, which are likely to be very sensitive to sample
quality and small variations in stoichiometry, the two materials have
similar quality factors. Therefore, it is likely that the thermoelectric
performance of GeSe can be improved by choosing an effective dopant
and by consequent band structure engineering.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
investigated the effect of Na doping on the
thermoelectric performance of GeSe. We have synthesized Ge1–xNaxSe (x = 0–0.04) compounds and measured their thermoelectric properties.
Our experimental results show that the substitution of Na for Ge in
GeSe gives rise to the formation of Na-rich precipitates within the
GeSe matrix and thus that Na is an unsuitable dopant for GeSe. Although
the power factor of these samples is low because the optimal carrier
concentration cannot be reached, GeSe could nevertheless be a promising
thermoelectric material if suitably doped because it shows intrinsically
low lattice thermal conductivity. The presence of Na-rich precipitates
decreases the lattice thermal conductivity by around 50% to ∼0.5
W m–1 K–1 at 500 K; thus, a codoping
strategy may be a fruitful approach to optimizing the thermoelectric
performance of GeSe. Furthermore, the carrier mobility of GeSe is
similar to that of the leading thermoelectric material SnSe, giving
a similar thermoelectric quality factor. Therefore, identifying an
effective dopant might lead to significant improvement in the thermoelectric
figure of merit in GeSe-based materials.
