Allylamine-functionalized
silicon quantum dots (ASQDs) of high
photostability are synthesized by a robust inverse micelle method
to use the material as a fluorescent probe for selective recognition
of thiocyanate (a biomarker of a smoker and a nonsmoker). The synthesized
ASQDs were characterized by absorption, emission, and Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy. Surface morphology is studied by transmission
electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The synthesized
material exhibits desirable fluorescence behavior with a high quantum
yield. A selective and accurate (up to 10–10 M)
method of sensing of thiocyanate anion is developed based on fluorescence
amplification and quenching of ASQDs. The sensing mechanism is investigated
and interpreted with a crystal clear mechanistic approach through
the modified Stern–Volmer plot. The developed material and
the method is applied to recognize the anion in the human blood sample
for identification of the degree of smoking. The material deserves
high potentiality in the field of bio-medical science.

1 Introduction
Quantum
dots (QDs) are highly photostable nanosized (2–10
nm)1 semiconductor having unique fluorescent
property, which is due to the quantum confinement effect.2,3 It has a broad range of application in the field of bioimaging,4 optoelectronics,5 photonics,6 biosensing,7 and chemical
sensing.8,9 Among the QDs searched so far (CdSe, CdTe,
CdS, ZnS, ZnSe, PbS, PbSe, GaAs, GaN, InP, and InAs), silicon QDs
(SQDs) are one of the best candidates for fluorescent probe because
of low toxicity as well as high photostability.3,10 Apart
from noncytotoxicity, SQDs also has tunable fluorescence property,
high luminosity,11 and less photobleaching
effect12 in comparison with other organic
dyes. Moreover, silicon is more abundant compared to others. Therefore,
SQDs are a very interesting moiety for research.

Various physical
and chemical processes such as electrochemical
etching,13,14 sol–gel method,15,16 laser ablation,17,18 thermal annealing, thermal vaporization,19 and inverse micelle20−22 are available
for the synthesis of the SQDs. Among these, though the inverse micelle
is robust one, it has two major drawbacks: (i) easy aerial oxidation
at room temperature and (ii) water insolubility. Water dispersibility
is one of the most important and essential features required for its
analytical and biological research.23 Therefore,
surface modification is strictly recommended for prevention of areal
oxidation as well as the incorporation of water solubility. Surface
modification is done by various materials such as acrylic acid,24 propionic acid,25 vinyl pyridine,26 and allylamine.22 Recently, the last one is getting more importance22,23,27 because of its structural features.
Allylamine moiety possesses the carbon–carbon double bond and
the amine group in terminal positions, which are suitable for hydrosilylation28 in the presence of a platinum catalyst at the
room temperature. The surface modifier has some effect on the fluorescence
property.23 It is found that amine-terminated
SQDs are more effective in exhibiting intense fluorescence in comparison
to alkyl groups.23,27 Thus, allylamine emerges as the
most important surface modifier.

Low-level thiocyanate is an
important constituent in the human
body; but its high concentration exhibits an evil effect. Clinical
studies show that the concentration of it in the blood serum becomes
high for the smoker in comparison to the nonsmoker.29,30 The concentration of the anion present in the human plasma level
found to be in the ranges 9–12 and 2–3 mg/L for the
smoker and the nonsmoker,29,30 respectively. The half-life
period of thiocyanate in the human blood is 1–2 weeks.31 Therefore, the thiocyanate ion may be used as
a biomarker for smokers and nonsmokers.32

During smoking, hydrogen cyanide is formed because of pyrolysis
or combustion of nicotine present in tobacco. The inhaled cyanide
is detoxified into the thiocyanate through incorporation of mitochondrial
rhodanese and β-mercaptopyruvate (shown in Scheme 1).33 The high concentration of the thiocyanate ion is not only the strongest
atherogenic factor but also liable for the formation of atherosclerotic
plaques within coronary arteries,34 which
increases the risk of cerebral infarction stroke.35,36 It is also responsible for increasing the plasma myeloperoxidase
level for which protein dialysis may be hampered along with uraemic
complication.36 Again, the anion is remarkably
responsible for blocking of the iodide uptake into the thyroid gland.
This is highly dangerous for children and pregnant women because of
the decrease in thyroxin formation and iodide deficiency.37

Scheme 1 Detoxification of CN– in
the Human Body
Among the available
methods till date for the thiocyanate sensing,
flurometric is the most scientifically convincing, easy, and less
time-consuming process. Toida et al.38 reported
fluorometeric sensing of the thiocyanate ion using Konig reaction,
but a major bottle neck of the method is that there is no concentration-dependent
study. Sarkar and his coworker39 studied
the same anion sensing using the Cd(II) complex. However, the method
is not a robust one. Zhang and his group40 synthesized gold nanoparticles and carbon dot-based probes for thiocyanate
ions. As per our best knowledge and literature survey, till date,
no report is found for allylamine-functionalized silicon QD (ASQD)-based
thiocyanate sensing.

Here, we reported for the first time robust,
quantitative, and
selective flurometric sensing of thiocyanate ions (a biomarker of
smokers and nonsmokers) with the designed and developed ASQD. The
indigenous material and method has been tested in real sample analysis.

2 Result and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the
ASQDs
2.1.1 UV–Vis Absorption Spectral Study
A steady-state UV–vis spectrum was recorded to study the
optical properties of ASQDs (Figure 1). It showed a continuous absorption pattern from 500
to 200 nm with a prominent shoulder around 327 nm. The appearance
of the shoulder is a distinctive nature of SQD because it is the corollary
of well-studied Γ to Γ direct band gap transition.41 Therefore, the nature and position of the shoulder
in the absorption spectra confirmed that ASQDs were synthesized successfully.

normalized absorption spectrum of ASQD, H-Terminated
Silicon QD (HSQD), and allylamine.

2.1.2 Fluorescence Study
The steady-state
fluorescence spectrum of aqueous ASQDs recorded in ambient temperature
is shown in Figure 2. It was found that the material exhibited emission maximum (λmax) at 439 nm on excitation at 327 nm. The emission of the
QDs occurred probably because of the jump of the promoted conduction
band electron to the valence band.42 Thus,
the fluorescent spectra revealed the successful formation of ASQDs.

Figure 2 Steady-state
normalized emission spectrum of ASQDs and HSQDs.

2.1.3 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Study
The FTIR spectrum of ASQDs is displayed in Figure 3. The appearance of a band along with an
overtone at 3124 cm–1 (νN–H stretch) and a sharp peak at 1569 cm–1 (νN–H bending) indicated the presence of a primary amine group in ASQD.43 The spectrum also exhibited a band at 1185 cm–1 because of the C–N stretching and another
two strong sharp peaks at 1500 and 1396 cm–1 for
the vibrational scissoring and symmetric bending of Si–CH244 moieties, respectively. Furthermore,
the appearance of a small peak at 1662 cm–1 indicated
successful attachment of allylamine in the silicon surface.20,44 Hence, FTIR spectroscopy revealed that ASQDs were synthesized successfully.

Figure 3 FTIR spectrum
of the ASQDs.

2.1.4 Morphological
Analysis
The morphological
analysis of the synthesized ASQDs was carried out by the assistance
of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (A, B), selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) (C) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) (D) study.
The TEM image of ASQDs (Figure 4A) reveals that the synthesized QDs were homogeneously dispersed
throughout the matrix with almost a spherical shape. It is also evident
from the image (Figure 4A,B) that the size of the QDs was uniformly distributed around the
1–2 nm range. The presence of prominent lattice fringe and
a circular ring pattern in the TEM and SAED images (Figure 4C), respectively, is a sign
of the crystalline nature of QDs.

Figure 4 TEM images (A,B), SAED pattern (C), and
DLS data (D) of ASQDs.

The DLS study (Figure 4D) shows that the average size of the QDs was around the 5
nm range. However, the result obtained from the DLS study does not
resemble with TEM data (1–2 nm range). This is due to the fact
that DLS considers the hydrodynamic size distribution, which is larger
than the consideration by TEM. Because the ASQDs were terminated with
a hydrophilic group (allylamine), the results obtained by DLS are
quite reasonable.

Therefore, homogeneous dispersion and uniform
size distribution
from morphological studies indicate that the synthesized ASQDs are
of high quality.

2.1.5 Quantum Yield
The fluorescence
quantum yields (φf) of ASQDs in water were calculated
with respect to 1-methylindole (in aqueous medium = 0.33 and fluorescence
excitation wavelength, λ = 280 nm) at 296 K45 by the following equation.46  where, φf, If, A, and n represent
the fluorescence quantum yield, intensity, absorbance, and refractive
index of the solvent, respectively, for the sample under investigation,
while φfR, IfR, AR, and nR designate the fluorescence quantum yield, intensity, absorbance,
and refractive index of the solvent for reference material, respectively.
Both the sample and the reference are excited at the same wavelength
and the A, AR values
are kept very low (<0.05) to measure If and IfR, respectively. The obtained value of φf for
ASQDs in water was found to be 0.37.

2.2 Sensing
of Thiocyanate Ions
2.2.1 Photoluminescence (PL)
Titration of ASQDs
at Various Concentrations of SCN– Ion
The
PL spectra of ASQDs were carried out in the absence and presence of
ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN). The concentration of thiocyanate
was varied from 1 × 10–10 to 15 × 10–1 M. The reason for taking the lower concentration
of 1 × 10–10 M was that the system could not
respond behind it; thus, this level of concentration is termed as
the limit of detection (LOD). The emission spectrum of pure ASQD consists
of a sharp peak at 439 nm and a weak band in the region 750–900
nm. The PL intensity at 439 nm was amplified slightly with the gradual
addition of the thiocyanate anion up to 1 × 10–6 M (critical point) and then quenched steeply with further increase
of the anion (Figure 5b). A similar trend was observed for the weak band in the longer
wavelength region (750–900 nm) (Figure 5a inset). The origin of the PL emission of
ASQDs is a complicated combination of direct (quantum confinement
effect) and indirect band gap transition.20 Zhou et al.47 suggested that 1–2
nm SQDs (silicon QD) with hydrogen or carbon surface termination have
direct band gap optical transitions, which is attributed to PL at
the UV–visible region in the electronic spectra. However, Wang
et al.48 suggested that in ASQDs, there
should be a photoinduced charge transfer (CT) between Si- and N-terminated
allylamine groups because of electronegativity difference. The resulted
excitonic state of ASQDs due to CT was responsible for its PL emission.
The initial minor amplification of PL intensity may be attributed
to the stabilization of the excitonic state of ASQDs in the presence
of the low level of the thiocyanate ion (through hydrogen bonded interactions).
However, the steep decrease of PL intensity beyond the critical point
may be explained in terms of photoinduced electron transfer (PET)
from the thiocyanate ion to the excitonic state of ASQDs. This interaction
seemingly affects the exciton dipole moment of ASQDs, so as to reduce
its radiative transition probability, thereby reducing the emission
intensity of the dots.

Figure 5 (a) PL titration of thiocyanate ions with ASQDs (inset:
the expansion
of the near-IR region); (b) PL intensity at 439 nm at various concentrations
of the thiocyanate ion.

The observed dynamic fluorescence quenching in the present
work
may be due to several processes such as PET, photosensitized excitation
energy transfer (PEET), and so forth. However, thiocyanate ions showed
very weak radiative transition (absorption) from the ground state
(S0) to the first excited singlet state (S1)
and no radiative transition (fluorescence emission) from S1 to S0. The spectral overlap between the absorption spectra
of thiocyanate ions and the fluorescence emission spectra of ASQD
is negligible. Therefore, we can rule out the possibility of PEET
from the singlet-excited ASQD to the ground-state thiocyanate ions.
This clearly indicated the presence of the other dynamic quenching
process, that is, PET from the ground-state thiocyanate ions (electron
donor, D) to the singlet-excited ASQD (electron acceptor, A), being
responsible for the observed fluorescence quenching of the singlet-excited
ASQD in the presence of ground-state anions. It may be noted that
PET between the D–A system may occur either by exciting the
donor (in the presence of the ground-state acceptor) or by exciting
the acceptor (in the presence of the ground-state donor).46

2.2.2 Modified Stern–Volmer
(SV) Plot
An attempt has been taken to explain the quenching
phenomena by
the conventional Stern–Volmer (SV) plot using eq 1. 1  where F0 and F represent
the fluorescence intensity of the fluorophore
ASQD in the absence and presence of the quencher thiocyanate ions,
respectively, and KSV is the SV constant
(or dynamic quenching constant) and [Q] is the quencher concentration.
The SV plot (Figure 6) showed a downward curvature toward the X-axis.
Thus, it is clear from the nonlinearity of the plot that quenching
data did not follow the usual SV equation (eq.1). Therefore, another attempt was designed
to explain the quenching through the modified SV plot (Figure 7).

Figure 6 SV plot of the ASQD in
the presence of different thiocyanate ion
concentrations.

Figure 7 Modified SV plot of ASQD.

Midoux et al. found a complex
SV plot for the fluorescence quenching
of tryptophan by trifluoroacetamide (TFA) and proposed that the complex
SV plot may be attributed to the presence of two fluorophore populations
of tryptophan, one of which is not accessible to the quencher.49 This kind of a different accessibility of the
fluorophore for fluorescence quenching has also been found for the
quenching of lysozyme by iodine.50 A modified
SV equation has been developed to explain this particular phenomenon:46 2  Here, the subscript “0” refers
to the fluorescence in the absence of the quencher; the subscripts
“a” and “b” stand for two populations
of fluorophores, that is, accessible and inaccessible or buried, respectively.
In the presence of the quencher, the fluorescence intensity of the
accessible fraction  decreases according to
the normal SV equation
(eq 1), while the inaccessible
fraction is not quenched. As a consequence, the observed fluorescence
intensity may be written as follows. 3  Here, Ka is the
SV quenching constant of the accessible fraction. From eq 2 and 3, we
get the following relation. 4  

Inversion of eq 4 followed
by the division into eq 2 gives the following relation. 5  Here 6  

Applying this modification eq 6, a plot of F0/ΔF versus 1/[Q] for the present
fluorophore-quencher system
yielded a straight line (Figure 7), which gives rise to the quenching constant (Ka). The value of Ka was found to be 19.79 L mol–1, which indicated
appreciable binding between the fluorophore-quencher.

2.2.3 Selectivity Study
The selectivity
study of the ASQDs (Figure 8A) toward the thiocyanate ion was done by taking 0.01 (M)
concentration of different anions such as SO4–2, SO3–2, NCO–, and
NO3–. The different anions were mixed
with a fixed amount of (0.2 mL) ASQDs, and the mixture was subjected
to a PL spectrometer. The spectra of different anions were compared
to the spectra of the pure ASQDs. It was observed that there was no
significant change in spectra (i.e., almost unaffected) with respect
to the pure ASQDs spectrum for all the anions studied except the thiocyanate
ion. The spectrum of the thiocyanate ion was quenched significantly.
Moreover, to check whether there are any effects of the cationic part
of the thiocyanate, potassium thiocyanate was taken with four different
concentrations. Interestingly, the spectral behavior (Figure 8B) matched with the spectra
of ammonium thiocyanate (Figure 5a), which indicated no role of the cationic counterpart
in the thiocyanate sensing process. Therefore, it may be concluded
that ASQDs can sense thiocyanate ions selectively.

Figure 8 (A) Emission intensity
of ASQDs toward various anions, (B) PL spectra
of ASQDs at different KSCN concentrations (where A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 are 10–1, 10–3, 10–5,
10–7, and 10–9 (M) KSCN concentrations,
respectively).

2.2.4 Thiocyanate
Recognition in the Blood Sample
The thiocyanate sensing ability
of ASQDs was not limited in synthetic
solutions, but it was also carried out in real biological samples
(Figure 9). The results
showed that the photoinduced quenching effect was more significant
for the smoker blood samples (S1, S2, and S3) compared to the nonsmokers
(NS1, NS2, and NS3). Thus, the synthesized material ASQD can acts
as a biomarker toward the blood of smokers and nonsmokers by differential
quenching of fluorescence intensity. The developed quenching method
also revealed that the smoker blood contains more thiocyanate than
its nonsmoker counterpart.

Figure 9 PL spectra of ASQD in the smoker and the nonsmoker
blood sample
with an error bar (error is almost equal to 5%) (where NS and S stand
for nonsmoker and smoker, respectively).

Now, for searching the quantitative degree of smoking, a
standard
curve (PI vs various synthetic solutions containing blood serum and
a known amount thiocyanate within 2–12 mg/L) has been drawn.
Comparing the results of real samples with the standard curve, it
may be concluded that the degree of smoking was the highest for sample
S3 (∼11 mg/L) and the lowest for S1 (∼9 mg/L). On the
other hand, the blood serum of nonsmokers contained thiocyanate with
the range 2–3 mg/L.

3 Conclusions
(i) Highly photostable ASQDs of desired
size (1–2 nm) and distribution (around 5 nm range) is synthesized
by a robust inverse micelle method.

(ii)The
synthesized material shows characteristic absorbance
at 327 nm and exhibits unique fluorescence of a sharp peak at 439
nm and a weak band in the region 750–900 nm with high quantum
yield (0.37).

(iii) The
quenching phenomena of ASQDs
with thiocyanate ions are well explained through the modified SV plot.
The value of the quenching constant (Ka) was found to be 19.79 L mol–1, which indicates
appreciable binding between the fluorophore and the quencher.

(iv) The developed ASQDs recognize
thiocyanate
ions selectively and accurately with the LOD value of 1 × 10–10 M.

(v) The explored recognition method could
estimate thiocyanate ions in the human blood sample to identify the
degree of smoking. Blood of the smoker contains a high amount of thiocyanate
ions (9–12 mg/L) compared to that of the nonsmoker (2–3
mg/L). Thus, ASQDs may be useful as a biomarker for the smoker and
the nonsmoker.

(vi) The
material and the method deserve
high potentiality to be used in the field of biomedical science.



4 Materials, Instruments, and
Method
4.1 Materials
Tetraoctyl ammonium bromide
(TOAB), silicon tetrachloride (99%), lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran
(LAH in THF), and chloroplatonic acid hexa-hydrated in Isopropanol
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Toluene (99%), methanol, allylamine,
ammonium thiocyanate, potassium thiocyanate, phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) buffer, and ammonium chloride were purchased from the Marck,
Mumbai, India. Double-distilled water obtained from the water double
distillation set. After distillation, toluene and methanol were used
after distillation.

4.2 Instrumentation
A sonicator of 40
kHz (Branson-1510) was used for sonication. All the electronic absorption
spectra were measured in the steady state of the synthesized ASQDs
by using a JASCO V-650 absorption spectrophotometer with a 1 cm path
length rectangular quartz cuvette at ambient temperature (300 K).
All the PL spectral measurements were done in the steady state by
using a JASCO FP-6500 fluorescence spectrometer, and the sample was
taken in a rectangular quartz cuvette (1 cm path length) at room temperature
(300 K). The solvent was evaporated by using a Superfit, Rotavap rotary
evaporator. Emission was recorded at right angles of the excitation
light direction in to avoid stray light. A Shimadzu-8400S spectrometer
was used for FTIR spectra. The sample for the FTIR spectra was prepared
in KBr pellets. TEM and SAED studies were carried out by using a JSM-100CX,
Jeol TEM microscope. The sample for TEM analysis was prepared by putting
of one drop sample in a standard carbon-coated copper grid and dried
overnight in a vacuum oven. The DLS study of the ADSQ was done for
size distribution analysis by using a Malvern Zetasizer Ver.6.34 instrument.
Ultra centrifuge was used for the collection of the blood serum from
blood samples.

4.3 Synthesis
4.3.1 Synthesis of HSQDs
The methodology
follows the standard synthetic procedure of silicon QDs by inverse
micelle20,22 with minor modification (Scheme 2). In brief, TOAB (0.003 mol)
was dissolved in dry toluene (100 mL) with the help of a magnetic
stirrer. Then, 92 μL of SiCl4 was added thorough
a gas-tight syringe, and the reaction mixture was allowed to mix well
for 1 h in inert atmosphere. A clear and transparent solution was
obtained. A calculated amount of LAH was mixed with that transparent
solution to obtain the desired mole ratio of SiCl4/LAH
(1:21.7). The reaction mixture became opaque at once, probably because
of the micelle formation. Now, the reduction of SiCl4 was
allowed to continue within the micelle for 3 h. After that, a stoichiometric
amount of anhydrous methanol was added to change the polarity of the
medium and to remove the unreacted LAH. The change in polarity probably
destroys the micelle as evident from the appearance of clear solution.
The clear solution mainly contained HSQDs.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of HSQDs
and ASQDs
4.3.2 Synthesis
of ASQDs
The surface
functionalization of HSQDs was carried out to produce ASQDs through
Chalk–Harrod hydrosilylation reaction with some modification.28 A calculated amount of the platinum catalyst
and allylamine reagent was added to maintain the designed stoichiometric
volume ratio of catalyst/allylamine (1:20). The solution was then
allowed to react for more than 3 h in ambient temperature. Then, all
the solvents were removed by rotary evaporation, which leads to the
formation of white dry powder. The dry powder mainly consisted of
ASQDs and the unreacted surfactant. To remove the surfactant, it was
dispersed into 20 mL of distilled water followed by sonication at
40 kHz for 30 min. Then unreacted TOAB was removed by successive filtration
through a 0.22 mm membrane. The filtrate contained mainly aqueous
solution of ASQDs.

4.3.3 Sample Preparation
4.3.3.1 Recognition of Thiocyanate in Synthetic
Solutions
The recipe for the preparation of synthetic solutions
is depicted in Table 1. The thiocyanate solution in PBS buffer (2.3 mL) was placed in series
of sample vials by varying its concentration from the molar to decinanomolar
range at a fixed amount of ASQDs (0.2 mL of 8.05 × 10–6 M). Each synthetic solution was subjected to fluorometric analysis.
The selectivity of ASQDs toward thiocyanate was checked with different
synthetic solutions such as sodium sulfite, sodium isocyanate, sodium
nitrate, ammonium chloride, and magnesium sulfate. The synthetic solutions
in PBS were prepared following the same procedure as thiocyanate.

4.3.3.2 Recognition of Thiocyanate in the Blood
Serum
A series of freshly collected 5 mL human blood samples
of both smokers and nonsmokers were taken from Pearson Memorial Hospital,
Visva-Bharati, Santiniketan-731235, India, and placed in centrifuge
tubes. After 30 min, the samples were subjected to centrifugation,
and the blood serums were collected carefully. Then, blood serum (2.3
mL) and ASQDs (0.2 mL) were mixed thoroughly for the fluorescence
study.
