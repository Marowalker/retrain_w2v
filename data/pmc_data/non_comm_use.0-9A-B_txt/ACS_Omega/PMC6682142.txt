Here,
we demonstrate the promising tunneling property of electrons
across quasi-graphene/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) through the
Coulomb blockade region. The melt-mixing technique is used to prepare
such a nanocomposite by mixing a nanofiller into the polymer matrix.
The structure and surface morphology are studied using X-ray diffraction
and field-emission scanning electron microscopy measurements, which
show defects oriented in the sample while the binding of matrix with
the nanofiller remains highly conductive even upon its binding with
the insulating matrix. Tunneling properties of quasi-graphene/PVDF
are studied using scanning tunneling microscopy measurements, which
indicate high resistance in the Coulomb blockade region. Potential
aspects of quasi-graphene/PVDF as a flexible material for device applications
are also discussed.

1 Introduction
The
last couple of decades have witnessed a great leap in transistor
technology from the rapid development of microelectronics to the birth
of present-day nanoelectronics with apparent deviations from Moore’s
scaling trend followed by substantial size reduction.1−14 Indeed, chemistry and materials science, in particular, have played
a pivotal role in the evolution of integrated circuits by enabling
the development of active devices with distinct and reliable properties.1−7 Of late, much attention has also been drawn into what is known as
flexible electronics because of its portability, lightweight, and
cost efficiency. Such unique features make it suitable for a wide
range of applications, including robotics, sensors, displays, and
tunable regulators.5 Nevertheless, developing
a material with high flexibility and better dielectric strength to
make it useful for flexible electronics remains still somewhat challenging,
though a lot of progress has been made in this direction.

Nanocomposites
are often regarded as potential materials for harvesting
superior dielectric strength and conductivity. Mechanical, electrical,
and also, thermal properties may often require improvement for materials
that build circuit components regarding polymer electronics and other
future technologies.6 In recent years,
the high-k fillers along with polymers such as multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), graphene/PVDF,
carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/PVDF, graphene/polyaniline (PANI), and MWCNT/PANI
have been part of active research5−17 related to sensors, electromagnetic interference shielding, flexible
electronics, etc. The high permittivity of a nanocapacitor is seen
to be unevenly disseminated as the dielectric host due to the nanofillers
conducts along with insulating polymer thin films between the matrices.
It may be noted that graphene oxides (GOs) are popularly exploited
as nanofillers for fiber-reinforced polymer composites.7−11,18−21 GOs can be chemically coated
onto the surfaces of either carbon fibers or carbon fabric to augment
the interfacial bonding properties through the surrounding polymer
matrix of the composites.12−17,22−27 On the other hand, poly(vinylindene fluoride) (PVDF) is known for
displaying ferroelectric behavior below 150 °C while pyroelectric
and piezoelectric properties at room temperature.28,29 It also exhibits low dissipation and good permittivity.29 Besides, PVDF possesses the ability to get polarize
quickly,30−33 which is harnessed in micro capacitors34−38 for electrostriction of muscles. However, as regards
the preparation methods for CNT or graphene/PVDF composites by various
processing and mechanical techniques, not much effort has been made
to observe or control the distribution of graphene or CNT with PVDF.7,8,13,14,18,22 The reason
is that CNT or graphene gets often randomly dispersed with the polymer
PVDF matrix. Consequently, this makes easy conductive network between
the filler and the matrix. Further, the dielectric, charge storage,
and switching properties can be studied conveniently because of the
presence of graphene nanofillers in the matrix.17,39 Such nanofillers can also be put into a hybrid matrix as graphene
is a promising conductive material.39

This work reports the preparation of quasi-graphene/PVDF using
the solvent casting technique. The as-prepared quasi-graphene/PVDF
films are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS), and Raman spectroscopy to study their structural and surface
morphologies. The electronic structure of a quasi-graphene/PVDF film
was examined using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and broadband
dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) measurements. The as-prepared nanocomposites
showed a conduction path, which was subsequently exploited in the
device building.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Analysis
The XRD pattern in Figure 1 shows several peaks at 2θ
∼ 18, 20, and 40° for PVDF and 2θ ∼ 26°
(JCPDS card no. 00-41-1487) for graphene. All of the above peaks are
confirmed in the graphene/PVDF sample with their average grain size
being close to 11 nm. Nevertheless, the increasing content of graphene
nanofiller makes the amount of the α-phase (2θ ≈
18°) decrease somewhat (as the α-peak gets suppressed),
while that of the β-phase (2θ ≈ 20°) increases
marginally. The β-phase of PVDF has better piezoelectric properties,
which assures that the graphene/PVDF sample with slight upsurge in
the β-phase of PVDF could be favorable for developing electronic
devices.32

graphene, PVDF, and the graphene/PVDF
nanocomposite.

2.2 Surface
and Morphological Analysis
FESEM images in Figure 2a,b portray surface
morphology of graphene, which appears as fine sheets of carbon. Figure 2c,d shows the FESEM
images of PVDF, appearing as fine small spherical balls. Subsequently,
the FESEM pattern of the graphene/PVDF nanocomposite is displayed
in Figure 2e,f, in
which the superior bonding is imaged. This is owing to the mixing
of graphene as a nanofiller with PVDF. The brighter part in the image
corresponds to the presence of graphene (as graphene is a well-known
highly conductive material), exhibiting a typical two-dimensional
(2D) structure (since small wrinkles and boundaries are visible) in
nature. From Figure 2e,f, one can perceive that the distribution of graphene is well defined
having PVDF throughout the matrix. Energy dispersion in the quasi-graphene/PVDF
film is confirmed by the EDS pattern, as shown in Supporting Information Figure S2.

PVDF, and (e, f) graphene/PVDF
nanocomposite.

According to the Raman
spectrum of quasi-graphene/PVDF (Figure 3), the G band due
to the E2g mode of graphite at the Γ
point is observed at 1592.4 cm–1, while the D band
due to the A1g breathing mode of the wrinkled
graphite lies at 1298.3 cm–1. The former represents
the in-plane C=C bond-stretching mode of sp2-hybridized
carbon atoms, while the latter embodies the vibration from k-point phonons of carbon atoms with dangling bonds.27 We observe that the intensity ratio of the quasi-graphene/PVDF
film (ID/IG) is found to be 1.24, implying that the excessive oxidation brings
about many defects and a higher level of disorder. Furthermore, graphene
can also be aligned well with an electric field.27

2.3 Electrical
Measurements
As shown in Figure S3, the conductivity plot of quasi-graphene/PVDF was
taken from 1 to 107 Hz frequency in the x-axis while its conductivity (σ) was measured from 10–11 to 10–4 S/cm, respectively. The extrapolated conductivity
at σ′(f) → 0 for quasi-graphene/PVDF
lies close to 10–11 S/cm, which increases generally
with the concentration of graphene nanofillers. Conductivity depends
typically on the concentration of graphene. In our electrical investigation,
both conductivity and capacitance analyses were focused on exploring
the electrical applications.

As reported in the literature,
PVDF at σ′(f) → 0 shows an almost
insulating nature.40 However, upon incorporating
a nanofiller, its conductivity surges quite significantly depending
on the weight ratio of the nanofillers. It starts decreasing at a
certain point, where the percolation threshold can be achieved. This
increasing trend in the conductivity of the quasi-graphene/PVDF may
be due to the transport of charge carriers with the aid of especially
the filler content.

The frequency-dependent conductivity σ′(f) is observed to obey the power law model 1   2  where σdc refers
to the dc
conductivity (frequency-independent), A and B are the temperature-dependent parameters, and f is the frequency. Additionally, n indicates
the power law exponent, representing thereby the degree of interaction
and transport nature of the charge carrier, as expounded by Funke
et al.41 For 0 ≤ n1 ≤ 1, the grain boundary conductivity refers to
the low-frequency region, i.e., the hopping motion will involve translation
motion with the sudden hopping, while for 0 < n2 < 2, the grain boundary conductivity refers to the
high-frequency region, i.e., hopping motion will involve localized
hopping without the species leaving the neighborhood.

According
to Figure S3, quasi-graphene/PVDF
obeys the power law, as given by eq 2, to display the single frequency as an activated region
(i.e., only one region is observed). It may be noted that other than
the lower-frequency region, most of the hops are ineffective. As the
frequency increases, chances for the hops to be unsuccessful become
more. It leads to the dispersive conductivity in the graphene/PVDF
nanocomposite. The tunneling nature of the nanocomposite is discussed
in the following section. This excellent nature of perfect conductivity
makes it suitable for electrical applications.

Figure 4 shows the
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) image of quasi-graphene/PVDF,
which is imaged at 400 nm scale (Figure S4). The gold tip was held at one position of the quasi-graphene/PVDF
film where voltage was varied from −0.5 to 0.5 V. Correspondingly,
the current variations were measured from −10 to +10 nA and
a nonlinear I–V curve, as
shown in Figure 4,
was obtained, which make it suitable to be used in nonlinear devices.
The nonlinearity found in the nanocomposite also makes it possible
to use it in memory devices for the ON or OFF operation, i.e., for
switching in devices as it also proves to be a better candidate for
memory storage (Figure 4). The extinction ratio between ON and OFF operations is obtained
as 48.5 dB. This nanocomposite provides a high tunnel current and
allows biases as large as possible without any electrical break down.
These nanocomposites provide a high tunnel current and also allow
biases as large as possible without electrical breakdown. All of these
convincingly reiterate that conduction in quasi-graphene/PVDF can
potentially takes place through quantum tunneling, which further suggests
that such nanocomposites can be used in making some electronic devices
of interest.

nm (top right) at different potentials of the graphene/PVDF nanocomposite.
Schematic showing the Fermi level and the tunneling process of electrons
(bottom left) in the graphene/PVDF nanocomposite. Schematic showing
formation of the Coulomb blockade region (bottom right) in the graphene/PVDF
nanocomposite.

Figure 4 indicates
the region identified for the Coulomb blockade, since there is no
current flow in the said region between −0.1 and 0.1 V. This
shows that there exists an increased resistance (i.e., resistances
are not constant in this region) at small bias voltage, which comprises
a tunnel junction. By applying a static magnetic field and allowing
only few electrons to tunnel, the Coulomb blockade provides a region
for the Pauli blockade. It results in the possibility of spin and
orbital interactions to be occurred between the electrons. This is
because it satisfies the energy-scale conditions , while electrons move onto the
charging or discharging stage.

Capacitance along the Coulomb
blockade region is 0.5 nF for quasi-graphene/PVDF
at 1 Hz, as shown in Figure 5. There is a sharp rise in the capacitance for quasi-graphene/PVDF
nanocomposites in the low-frequency region. As the weight ratio of
the nanofiller increases, it can readily act as parallel plates for
the formation of the conducting path to display the piezoelectric
effect (Figures S5 and S6). This phenomenon
will result in the charge storage inside the nanocomposites. At about
3 nF, the highest capacitive nature is observed for the as-prepared
nanocomposites. As we know, before attaining the percolation threshold,
there exists a tunneling current between any two nearby carbon bonds,
depending upon the applied energy. As observed in Figure 5, after reaching the highest
point, they are readily discharged, tending to attend its initial
stage. This charging and discharging states of the nanocomposites
make them suitable for the storage applications.

at room temperature.

Figure 6 shows
the I–V plot of the device,
as designed
(Figure S7) using the quasi-graphene/PVDF
nanocomposite. I–V measurements
were carried out at various temperature stages to study how much temperature
such nanocomposites can withstand. As shown in Figure 6, the current increases with the rise in
temperature, thus demonstrating a good resistive path for quasi-graphene/PVDF.
Such nanocomposites are capable of withstanding a certain limit of
temperature, beyond which they may break down. One should hence be
careful while handling such a kind of nanocomposite especially when
it is exposed to excess heat or temperature.

the graphene/PVDF nanocomposite-based device measured at different
temperatures.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have successfully prepared the quasi-graphene/PVDF
nanocomposite by a mere solvent casting technique. The as-prepared
nanocomposites are mostly homogeneous in nature. The presence of both
graphene and PVDF is confirmed by XRD, whereas the Raman analysis
showed the ID/IG ratio as 1.24, indicating that graphene can align well with an electric
field. The superior mixing of graphene and PVDF, as evident from the
FESEM images where the bright regions stem from the large secondary
electron emission, can be well associated with the conductivity plot.
The charge storage capability as observed here demonstrates that such
nanocomposites can be quite efficient for switching and storage applications.
STM measurements subsequently affirm that quasi-graphene/PVDF can
exhibit good tunneling behavior without any electrical breakdown even
through the Coulomb blockade region. The electrical nature of the
as-designed device was found to be efficient and thus can be potentially
suitable for flexible electronics, for the possibility of providing
high biasing without any breakdown in the circuit.

by probe-type ultrasonication for another 1 h. Graphene/PVDF/DMF solution
was magnetically stirred for 1 h by maintaining the temperature between
50 and 70 °C to achieve proper dispersion in the solution. Finally,
the solution was hot-pressed for about 6–8 h at a constant
temperature of 80 °C and then it was allowed to cool to room
temperature.

microscope was used to image the surface and dispersion state of graphene
flakes in quasi-graphene/PVDF.
