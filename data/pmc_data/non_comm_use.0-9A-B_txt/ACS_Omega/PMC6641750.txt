Production of oxygen-deficient tungsten
oxide nanoparticles with
a diameter of around 10 nm have been successfully developed using
a microwave-induced plasma in liquid technique. The prepared blue-green
nanoparticles exhibit strong absorption in the visible region; thus,
these could be efficient visible-light photocatalysts. The high-angle
annular dark-field images revealed the dislocation of tungsten, which
causes oxygen deficiencies.

Introduction
Considerable efforts
have been made for developing clean, green,
and renewable energy-related technologies, such as those involving
photocatalysis, artificial photosynthesis, and the use of lithium-ion
batteries, solar cells, and fuel cells.1 Various materials, including metals, metal chalcogenides, oxides,
carbides, nitrides, and phosphides, have been developed, and tungsten
oxides (WOx, x ≤
3) have received considerable attention due to their abundance, highly
tunable composition, and a high chemical stability at appropriate
pH values.2 WO3 is made up of
perovskite units and is one of the most attractive candidates for
photocatalysis, as it exhibits approximately 12% absorption of the
solar spectrum (Eg = 2.5–2.8 eV).
WO3 is also well known for its nonstoichiometric properties,
as the lattice can withstand a considerable number of oxygen vacancies.
Many oxygen-deficient oxides (WOx, x < 3), such as WO2.98, WO2.96,
WO2.9, WO2.83, and WO2.72, have been
investigated and are found to have a stable crystal phase that is
different from the surface-reduced WO3 and also exhibit
a strong light absorption up to the near-IR region.3−6 Unlike WO3, which is
yellow, WOx (x < 3)
are either green or blue, with an additional broad absorption peak
above 480 nm. This additional absorption is attributed to the new
discrete energy bands below the conduction band, which are created
by the oxygen vacancies.

Nanostructured WO3 has been
prepared by various methods,
including thermal evaporation deposition, sputtering, and other physical
vapor deposition.7−12 However, the preparation of very small nanoparticles with diameters
in the range of 1–10 nm, which are important for realizing
efficient photocatalysis due to their relatively large specific areas,
has still not been achieved.

The purpose of the current work
was to find a de novo simple strategy
for the preparation of small WO3 or oxygen-deficient WOx nanoparticles showing a strong absorption in
the visible region, which are suitable for the use as efficient photocatalysts.
Recently, the synthesis of metal nanocomposites using plasma in liquid
has been developed by the authors’ group and others. Radio
frequency (usually 13.56 MHz) equipment have been used to produce
plasma in the last decade,13 but recently,
microwave equipment (2.45 GHz) have become popular as an easy power
source.14 Plasma can easily be produced
with a small microwave equipment due to the high frequency of the
microwave radiation. During the plasma production process, bubbles
are continuously formed in the liquid phase, and plasma is generated
inside the bubbles or around the bubble boundaries as reported in
previous studies.14,15

We have previously reported
the syntheses of Au,16,17 Ag,18 Pt,18 alloy NPs,19 ZnO,14 and black TiOx20 nanoparticles using microwave-induced
plasma in aqueous
solution containing metal ions or precursor metal complex. Moreover,
we have recently succeeded in the preparation of W-doped TiOx nanoparticles that show a strong absorption in the
visible region by modifying the commercially available TiO2 nanoparticles through the plasma process.15 Herein, we report a de novo and simple methodology to prepare WO3 nanoparticles 1–10 nm in diameter with oxygen vacancies
by a plasma-in-liquid technique using a bulk W wire as the metal source.
In this method, the bulk W can be melted or evaporated by very high
temperature of the plasma (several thousands °C) and is immediately
cooled by the surrounding water (<100 °C). Similar preparation
of WO3 nanoparticles by the plasma method has been reported;21 however, the mechanism of the nanoparticle formation
via the plasma process is still uncertain. In the current work, we
systematically investigated the effect of plasma pulse frequencies
and successfully revealed the formation mechanism of WO3 nanoparticles via the plasma-in-liquid process.

Experimental
Section
Sample Preparation by Microwave-Induced Plasma in Liquid
Synthesis of O-deficient WO3 nanoparticles by microwave-induced
plasma was carried using the procedure described below. A homemade
microwave-induced plasma-in-liquid system was used for the synthesis
(Figure 1). In a typical
process, 2 dm3 of distilled water was added to the reactor
and stirred at 250 rpm. Using a functional generator, the pulse frequency
was controlled from 100 to 400 Hz and the plasma reaction was continued
for 1 h. A 3 mmϕ tungsten rod (purity 99.96%, Nippon Tungsten,
Japan) was selected as the metal source. Plasma ignition was easiest
using the rod of this diameter. The obtained solution was concentrated
to ca. 50 cm3 under a reduced pressure and was then filtered
(using a hydrophilic poly(tetrafluoroethylene) filter with 0.2 μm
pore size, Advantec Toyo) and dried overnight under vacuum.

Figure 1 Experimental
setup of the homemade microwave-induced plasma equipment.
The microwaves were generated by UW-1500 (Micro-Denshi, Japan) at
2.45 GHz. Microwaves emitted from the magnetron pass through a WRJ-2
rectangular waveguide (109.22 × 54.61 mm2), a power
meter, a tuner, and a waveguide to the coaxial adapter. A function
generator (WF1973, NF corporation) was used to change the pulse frequency.
The electrodes were made of tungsten (3.0 mmϕ, purity 99.96%).

Characterization
The obtained WO3 samples
or electrodes after the reaction were characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) (Rigaku, MiniFlexII), transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
(Hitachi, H-9500 with acceleration voltage of 300 kV), FE-SEM (JEOL,
JSM-6701F), HAADF–STEM (JEOL, JEM-ARM200, acceleration voltage
of 200 kV), and UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (JASCO,
V-670). The plasma generation was observed by a high-speed camera
(Vision Research, PHANTOM Miro eX4, 8113 flames s–1). The emission spectrum of the generated plasma was observed by
AvaSpec-2048 (Avantes). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
specific surface area was evaluated based on the nitrogen adsorption
at 77 K using a Quantachrome NOVA 1200e surface area and a pore size
analyzer. For the photocatalysis performance test, a 400 W high-pressure
mercury arc lamp (SEN LIGHTS Co. Ltd, HL-400BL) was used.

Results
and Discussion
Preparation and Sizes of WO3 Nanoparticles
The samples were dried under vacuum for overnight. The color of
our
obtained samples was blue to green. They were found to be completely
different from the commercially available WO3 particle
(Beijing DK nano technology, Purity 99.9%) (Figure 2). It is well known that a low-valent tungsten
(such as in O-deficient WOx) exhibits
a rather strong absorption in the visible region (>480 nm), which
can be attributed to the new discrete energy bands that are created
below the conduction band due to oxygen vacancies, thus changing its
colors to blue or green. Thus, it is expected that our products may
consists of deficient WOx (x < 3).

at 100–400 Hz pulse frequency) and commercially available WO3 powder.

The synthetic yields
are summarized in Table 1. The synthetic yield is defined as eq 1 1  where the constant value of 1.261 is the mass
ratio between W metal and WO3, hypothesizing that all of
electrode loss resulted in the formation of WO3. The synthetic
yield at 100 Hz was found to be much smaller than that for 200–400
Hz. In fact, large W fragments were obtained as precipitates at 100
Hz due to the cavitation of the electrode. The synthetic yield was
therefore decreased at 100 Hz. The differences in the synthetic yields
will be discussed later, along with the mechanism of the nanoparticle
formations.

the histograms, more than 100 particles from several TEM images were
counted.

Investigation of the Plasma
Formation Process
To understand
the mechanism that causes the differences in the synthetic yield as
summarize in Table 1, we used a high-speed camera to record the plasma formation process
(Figure 4). The detection
interval was set at 8113 frames s–1. As shown in Figure 1, we observed an
orange flame inside the bubble, which is due to the blackbody radiation
of W metal,22 indicating plasma generation.
Most importantly, the generated plasma completely disappeared before
the introduction of the next pulse at 100 Hz (the pulse injection
occurs every 10 ms). On the other hand, we could continuously observe
the stable plasma at 300 Hz condition at any period during our observation.
The stability of the plasma (i.e., the disappearance/continuity of
plasma) should be significantly important for the formation of nanoparticles.
At 100 Hz, the tip of W electrode was immediately cooled down by the
surrounding water; thus, the reaction temperature should be lower
than the other conditions. The W electrode was, on the other hand,
continuously exposed to plasma at 300 Hz condition and, therefore,
was subjected heating (as evidenced by a stable blackbody radiation
of W), increasing the reaction temperature to as high as ∼9000
°C (see the estimation of plasma temperature by the emission
spectrum of Hα and Hβ as shown in Figure S1 and detailed explanations). Because
the nanoparticle formation of the current system is based on the evaporation
or melting of W, the temperature of the electrode should affect the
mechanism of the nanoparticle formation.

Figure 4 Pictures of plasma generations
captured by a high-speed camera
(8113 flames s–1).

To verify this assumption, we observed the field emission
scanning
electron microscopic (FE-SEM) images of the W electrodes after the
plasma reaction (Figure S2). The FE-SEM
image of the samples obtained at 100 Hz of microwave pulse frequency
showed flat surfaces, suggesting that the melting of the electrode
is a crucial process in ejecting W from the electrode. On the other
hand, rough surfaces with lots of small bumps were observed in the
case of the samples obtained at 300 Hz. These rough surfaces and bumps
strongly propose that the evaporation of electrode is the dominant
process for the ejection of W from the electrode. Thus, the evaporation
of W electrode resulted in the formation of spherical WOx nanoparticles (around 10 nm) observed in the TEM
measurements (Figure 2). The formed W clusters or nanoparticles are readily combined with
O radicals generated by the plasma from H2O molecules,
resulting in the formation of WOx nanoparticles.
A lower synthetic yield at 100 Hz condition compared with that in
other conditions can be attributed to a low reaction temperature,
which results in the melting of the electrode as a main process for
the ejection of W. The formation of WOx nanoparticles, which are derived
from the evaporation of W electrode, is thus suppressed. A large bulk
of W precipitates, which should be formed via melting of the electrode
at a lower reaction temperature at 100 Hz condition, therefore decreases
the synthetic yield.

Detailed Characterizations of the Obtained
WO3 Nanoparticles
The obtained powders were characterized
by XRD (Figure 5).
The characteristic peaks
of WO3, around 23.2, 24.3, 26.5, 29, 34, and 42°,
were observed for all of the samples (broader peaks are observed around
29, 34, and 42°). Among several crystal structures of WO3-related materials, our results are in good agreement with
the ε-WO3 crystal structure. The broad XRD peaks
indicate that the obtained WO3 nanoparticles consist of
a mixture of crystal grains, such as ε-, γ-, δ-,
H0.1-WO3, and WO2.98 (note that the
crystal structure of WO2.98 is very similar to that of
WO3, as determined by a previous study3). Because
these tungsten oxides show similar XRD patterns and our patterns exhibited
broad peaks, we were not able to estimate the exact ratios of the
amounts of these components in our sample. However, it should be noted
that this result might suggest the existence of low-valence state
W atoms (as WO2.98 or other WOx with more oxygen vacancies, and H0.1-WO3)
in our product.

Figure 5 XRD patterns of synthetic WO3 nanoparticles.
References
were obtained from JCPDS data: γ-WO3 (00-043-1035),
ε-WO3 (01-087-2402), δ-WO3 (01-083-0947),
WO3·H2O (01-084-0886), H0.1-WO3 (01-006-0210), and α-W (00-004-0806).

It is well known that ε-WO3 cannot
be obtained
as a main product by conventional WO3 synthesis and is
a stable crystal phase below −43 °C.23,24 It has been reported that ε-WO3 was obtained when
the synthesis was carried out at a very high temperature followed
by an immediate cooling of the samples to room temperature (as reported
by the flame spray pyrolysis method).25 Our liquid plasma method also has a high reaction temperature (several
thousands °C) and the nanoparticles were immediately cooled (several
tens °C) by the surrounding water in the reaction bath. Thus,
ε-WO3 could be the main product. WO3·H2O was observed only in the samples prepared at 100 Hz of microwave
pulse frequency, as is evident from the peaks at 16.4 and 25.5°.
This could be attributed to the introduction of water molecules due
to the low reaction temperature. The pattern of metal W (α-W
observed at 40.3°) indicates contamination of the electrode by
cavitation.

The photophysical property of the synthesized WOx nanoparticles was investigated by recording
the diffuse
reflectance spectra in the range of 200–800 nm with a baseline
of BaSO4 (Figure 6). As expected from the sample colors (Figure 2), visible-light absorption above 480 nm
was drastically improved on comparison with the commercially available
WO3 particles. Ohtani et al. have reported similar absorption
characteristics of WO3 films containing low-valence state
W atoms that were produced by applying a negative potential.26 This electrochromism behavior can be attributed
to the reduction of W6+ to W5+ by the potential
and the intervalence charge transfer between these W ions, which resulted
in the absorption in the visible region.27,28 On the basis of this assumption, we concluded that our WOx nanoparticles partially consist of low-valence
state W atoms, which causes an improved absorption in the visible
region.

Figure 6 UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the commercially available
WO3 (black) and the synthetic WOx nanoparticles under various pulse frequencies.

The decrease in the visible-region absorption with the pulse
frequencies
is probably due to the reaction temperature. The high microwave pulse
frequency maintains the W electrode at a higher temperature during
the synthesis. Decomposition of water into O or other radical proceeds
efficiently at a high plasma temperature; thus, the concentration
of O radical tends to be higher with the microwave pulse frequencies.
This may lead to a slightly effective interaction between the formed
W nanoparticles and the O radicals. Thus, the O deficiency of the
obtained WOx nanoparticles is slightly
decreased as the microwave pulse frequency is increased (Figure 5), which could cause
a difference in their visible absorption.

STEM Investigation of the
Atomic Arrangement of Oxygen-Deficient
WOx Nanoparticles and Their Properties
High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopic
(HAADF–STEM) images of the obtained samples are shown in Figure 7. HAADF–STEM
method enables us to observe the chemical contrast according to the
atomic number (Z). Because the atomic number of 74W is very large, W atoms are observed as clear white spots
in the HAADF images. We then could observe the crystalline atom arrangements
using the HAADF images. Two kinds of lattice spacing values of 3.82
and 3.64 Å were observed, corresponding to {002} and {200} lattices
of δ-WO3 and γ-WO3, respectively.
Interestingly, we observed a few deformation sites in our HAADF–STEM
image, marked by yellow circles, and a magnified image of one of these
regions can be seen in Figure 7b. In the marked region in Figure 7b, the crystal structure is found to be nonuniform
and distorted. Moreover, we observed an excess of W atoms in the region.
This observation strongly suggests that the low-valence state W atoms
are incorporated into the obtained WOx nanoparticles, resulting in their strong visible absorption.

Figure 7 (a) HAADF–STEM
image of the obtained WO3 nanoparticles
prepared at 300 Hz and (b) magnified image in red-square region in
(a). Yellow circles indicate the deformation sites.

A preliminary investigation of the photocatalysis
performance of
(a) representative WOx product synthesized
by 100 Hz plasma frequency and (b) the commercially available γ-WO3 nanoparticles (Beijing DK nano technology) was carried out
by the rhodamine 6G (R6G) degradation test under the irradiation by
400 W high-pressure mercury arc lamp. Briefly, 2.4 mg of photocatalysis
powder was dispersed in 12 mL of 10 mg L–1 R6G aqueous
solution. The mixture was stirred for 30 min under dark. 1 mL of suspension
was collected and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min to precipitate
the photocatalysis powders. The absorption spectrum of the supernatant was measured to determine the initial concentration of R6G. The
sample was then irradiated and the absorption spectra of the supernatant
were observed every 10 min.

Figure S3 in the Supporting Information shows the
raw absorption spectral change
during irradiation. Figure S4 shows the
concentration change of R6G ln(C0/C) as a function of irradiation time. The degradation of
R6G was able to be analyzed by first-order kinetics, with the classical
equation of ln(C0/C)
= kt, where C0 and C denote the absorbance at 526 nm before and after the irradiation,
respectively, and k and t denote
the reaction rate constant and the irradiation time, respectively.
The k values obtained were 6.2 × 10–1 and 3.3 × 10–1 h–1 for
the synthetic WOx and the commercially
available WO3, respectively. Because the used nanoparticles
have different specific surface area (41 and 30 m2 g–1, determined by BET method), the obtained k values were normalized to determine the reaction activity
at the same surface area after the subtraction of the degradation
rate of R6G under the absence of photocatalysis (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). As a result, the synthetic WOx showed
approximately 1.6 times higher photocatalytic activity than the commercially
available WO3.

Conclusions
In
conclusions, we have developed a de novo method to produce oxygen-deficient
tungsten oxide nanoparticles using a plasma-in-liquid technique. We
have successfully obtained blue-green spherical and well-crystalline
nanoparticles with diameters of around 10 nm, and the product showed
better photocatalytic R6G degradation performance than the commercially
available WO3 nanoparticles. We believe that this method
can be beneficial in the future for the development of efficient photocatalyst
that utilizes the visible light.
