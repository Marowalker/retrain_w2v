Au2nCl– (n = 1–4) clusters are investigated
by both laser
ablation mass spectrometry and theoretical calculations. It is interesting
to find that the electron affinities of neutral Au2nCl (n = 1–4) clusters are much larger
than those of corresponding pure Au2n clusters.
Among them, the electron affinity of Au2Cl is 4.02 eV,
which can be defined as a very unique superhalogen that is quite different
from classical ones of MnXm (M = metal, X = halogen, and n < m). Natural bond orbital and highest occupied molecular
orbital analyses indicate that the extra electron is predominantly
delocalized over the positively charged metal moiety in these anionic
Au2nCl– clusters, which
is the main reason for the large electron affinities of the corresponding
neutral species.

Introduction
It is well-known that
the electron affinity (EA) is a significant
property related to chemical stabilities and reactivities of corresponding
molecules. For example, superhalogens with high electron affinities
exhibit superior chemical reactivity and strong oxidation properties.1−3 Several methods have been used to measure EAs experimentally, and
the most effective one is based on the photoelectron detachment.4,5 Besides, theoretical calculations have been successfully applied
to predict EAs for many species.6−11 A number of theoretical methods such as ab initio methods and density
functional theory have been widely used in such kinds of studies.12−14 In particular, EA can be used as an important indicator to identify
superhalogens, which are defined as species with higher EAs than that
of chlorine atom.15−19 Since Boldyrev and Gutsev first proposed the superhalogen examples
of MXk+1 in the early 1980s, there are
many kinds of superhalogens that were identified by now, such as MX3 (M = Be and Mg, Ca; X = Cl and Br), Mg2X5 (X = F and Cl), and so on.18,20−28 The EA value can be as high as 9.7 eV for Gd(BF4)4.29 Besides, superhalogen properties
can be manifested by the vertical detachment energies (VDEs) of the
corresponding anions. It has been confirmed that many superhalogens
have high VDEs.30,31 The largest VDE value is 13.871
eV for H12F13–.31 The potential applications of superhalogens
in the development of organic superconductors, biocatalysts, high
energy density materials, and nonlinear optical materials have attracted
more and more interest in recent years.32−35

As the most electronegative
metal atom in the periodic table, Au
has attracted great attention in the field of superhalogens.36−48 Chemical properties including structures, superhalogen properties,
and catalytic mechanisms of gold-containing clusters have been widely
investigated recently.37−42 For example, Jena and co-workers performed a systematic study of
Aun(BO2) clusters where n = 1–5, and the results showed that Aun(BO2) clusters possessed larger EAs than
those of pure Aun clusters because of
the delocalization of the extra electron over the Aun cluster.42 Because of their tunable
chemical relativities, other element-doped gold clusters have been
extensively studied.43−48 Pyykkö et al. reported the highly stable doped gold cluster
W@Au12 theoretically.43,44 Wang et al.
reported the single-doped SiAu4.46 Their results show that [SiAu4] has a large energy gap
of 2.4 eV, thus indicating an extremely chemically stable molecule.
[SiAun] (n = 2–4)
are structurally and electronically similar to SiHn, so the gold atom can exhibit chemistry analogous to the hydrogen
atom, and the Au/H analogy may allow new auro analogues of hydride
molecules to be designed. In this work, we used a combination of Fourier
transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT ICR) mass spectrometry and theoretical
calculations to examine the polynuclear clusters of Au2nCl– (n = 1–4)
comprehensively. The effects of halogen doping on the EAs of the clusters
are discussed in detail.

Results and Discussions
AunCln+1– (n = 1–4) ions were previously
studied by Ma et al. on the same instrument using similar experimental
conditions.49 Different from the previous
experiments performed by the same group, the concentration of the
sample of AuCl4H solution applied here was reduced from
20 to 2 mg/mL, and the applied laser energy was also reduced by 10%
in order to optimize the experimental conditions for the anions reported
here. Figure 1 shows
one typical laser ablation mass spectrum obtained under such conditions.
Besides previously observed anions of Au2Cl3– and Au3Cl2–, cluster anions of Au2nCl– (n = 1–4) and Au2n+1– (n = 1–4) can
be observed in the spectrum. In addition, the most prominent peak
in the mass spectrum of Au2nCl– clusters occurred at n = 2.

Figure 1 Anions observed in the
laser ablation mass spectrum of AuCl4H.

To gain further insight into anions of Au2nCl– (n = 1–4), theoretical
calculations were performed at the MP2 level with the Stuttgart energy-consistent
relativistic pseudopotentials ECP60MDF, in which the valence basis
sets of MDF60 and aug-cc-pVTZ were employed for Au and for Cl, respectively.
Some stable structures of the anions are shown in Figure 2. It is also found that the
most stable isomers (1a, 2a, 3a, and 4a) all prefer singlet. Except
for Au8Cl–, these lowest energy structures
are all characterized by planar configurations. For Au2Cl–, the most stable geometric structure is linear
and the Cl atom in the terminal position. Interestingly, this trend
is maintained for all the most stable isomers of Au2nCl– (n = 2–4). The
equilibrium geometries of their corresponding neutral clusters were
also optimized at the same level. It is also found that all these
geometries preferred doublets. As shown in Figure 3, there is a significant difference between
the lowest energy geometries of anionic and neutral species. Neutral
Au2Cl and Au4Cl clusters are characterized by
their planar configurations, while Au6Cl and Au8Cl clusters are characterized by their 3D-configurations. Au2Cl has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry. Moreover, it is found that the linear
isomers of 1b and 1c shown in Figure 3 are respectively 8.1 and 16.6 kcal/mol higher in energy
than the most stable isomer 1a. Obviously, the geometric structures
of these clusters are dramatically altered by the extra electron in
the anions. For example, the most stable structure of Au2Cl has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry, but the most stable structure of the Au2Cl– anion cluster is linear.

relative energies (ΔE, in kcal mol–1) of Au2nCl– (n = 1–4) clusters

and their relative energies (ΔE, in kcal mol–1) of Au2nCl (n = 1–4) clusters obtained at the MP2
level.

To better understand the properties
of these clusters, their EA
values and corresponding VDEs of their corresponding anions were calculated
and the results are listed in Table 1. Interestingly, the EA value of Au2Cl is
4.02 eV, which is higher than that of chlorine atoms, namely, 3.62
eV. The point makes Au2Cl a superhalogen that is very different
from those classical superhalogens of MnClm (n < m) described by Gutsev and Boldyrev of which the number
of metal atoms is less than the number of halogen atoms. This superhalogen
characterized by the number of metal atoms exceeds the number of halogen
atoms and it can be classified as a multimetal superhalogen. For Au4Cl, Au6Cl, and Au8Cl clusters, the electron
affinities are 3.43, 3.04, and 3.44 eV, respectively, which are larger
than the corresponding values of pure Au4 (2.63 eV), Au6 (2.00 eV), and Au8 (2.79 eV) clusters.48,50 In our work, the VDEs of Au2nCl– (n = 1–4) clusters are higher
than the EAs of corresponding neutral clusters. The results are shown
in Table 1.

The
superhalogen behavior of the Au2Cl cluster can be
attributed to the fact that the extra electron delocalizes over the
metal moiety in the anionic clusters.42 The charges on each of the atoms in both neutral and anionic Au2nCl clusters were calculated using natural
bond orbital (NBO) analyses. As shown in Table S1, the charges on the Au2 moieties are +0.69e and −0.24e in Au2Cl
and Au2Cl–, respectively, indicating
that the extra electron is delocalized over the metal moiety predominantly
(93%) in the anion.

For the Au4Cl cluster, the charge
on the Au4 moiety is +0.68e. When an extra
electron is added
to the neutral Au4Cl cluster, it is expected that this
charge would localize mostly on Au4. NPA charge analysis
indeed confirms this and 96% of the extra electron goes to the Au4 moiety. Similarly, NPA charge analyses show that the charges
on Au6 and Au8 moieties in neutral Au6Cl and Au8Cl are +0.59e and +0.61e because of the doping of chlorine atom. For Au6Cl– and Au8Cl–, the
charges on the Au6 and Au8 moieties are −0.31e and −0.30e, respectively. This
also indicates that the extra electron is mostly distributed over
the metal moiety (90 and 91%) which is positively charged in the neutral
species. It is the main reason for the larger electron affinities
of Au6Cl and Au8Cl than those of pure Au6 and Au8 clusters. Interestingly, even though the
EA of Au4, Au6, and Au8 clusters
are not high, they can still win the extra electron from Cl in Au4Cl, Au6Cl, and Au8Cl clusters, and the
change in their EAs are indeed induced by the doping of chlorine atoms.51 In addition, we also compare the VDEs of Au2nCl– clusters with that
of other gold–chlorine clusters with different compositions.
Because AunCln+1 clusters make more positively charged gold moieties, thus it is
expected that AunCln+1 clusters should have larger VDEs. Based on the structures
suggested previously, the VDEs were calculated. In addition, the results
do show that the VDEs of AunCln+1– (n = 1–7)
range from 4.99 to 7.06 eV (Table S2),
which are larger than the VDEs of Au2nCl– clusters.

To investigate the electron
distribution of the lowest energy configurations,
their highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) were also analyzed. Figure 4 shows the HOMOs
of the four most stable isomers of the Au2nCl– clusters. From the figure, it can be clearly
found that the HOMOs of the Au2nCl– clusters have main contribution from the Aun moieties, instead of Cl atoms. The energy gap between
HOMO and lowest occupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) is generally thought
to be a good measure of the chemical inertness of a species.52−54 In our work, the HOMO–LUMO gap values of Au2nCl– (n = 1–4)
are 5.53, 5.36, 4.24, and 4.69 eV, in turn. These large energy gaps
make these anionic clusters stable, and thus can be generated and
detected in the experiments readily.

Figure 4 HOMOs of the clusters of Au2nCl– (n = 1–4),
corresponding to
the isomers of 1a, 2a, 3a, and 4a shown in Figure 2.

Two aspects can be further discussed here. The first one is that
if the doping chlorine atom is replaced by one F or Br atom, how their
structures and EAs would be changed. Thus, theoretical calculations
were performed for Au2nF and Au2nBr (n = 1–4) clusters on
the same level. The most stable structures of the Au2nF–, Au2nF, Au2nBr–, and Au2nBr (n = 1–4) are
shown in Figure S1–S4. Most of these
isomers have similar structures. However, Au6F and Au8Br show two different cases. The first and second most stable
isomers reverse their energy order in the cases of F and Br. As shown
in Figure 5, the EA
values of Au2F, Au4F, Au6F, and Au8F are 4.08, 3.49, 3.22, and 3.46 eV, in turn, which are all
slightly larger than those of Au2nCl (n = 1–4). For Au2nBr
(n = 1–4) clusters, the EA values are 3.93,
3.20, 2.98, and 3.43 eV, which are all slightly smaller than those
of Au2nCl (n = 1–4)
clusters. The results show that the species of halogen atom has little
effect on the EAs of Au2nX (n = 1–4, X = F, Cl, and Br), and the doping of the F atom can
increase their EAs more. We also carried out the calculations of Cu2nCl and Ag2nCl
(n = 1–3). The electron affinities of Cu2nCl (n = 1–3) are
2.51, 1.72, and 1.56 eV, in turn. Moreover, those for Ag2nCl are 2.51, 1.90, and 1.87 eV. The results show
that the electron affinities of Cu2nCl
and Ag2nCl (n = 1–3)
are much lower than those of Au2nCl, and
none of them should be considered as a superhalogen. The second aspect
will be more difficult to answer, that is, how about doping a Cl atom
into large gold clusters, such as Au20? It will be interesting
to see to what extent the doping of a single halogen atom can affect
the structures and properties of large-sized gold clusters, and this
will be the topic of our future research.

the clusters of Au2nX (n = 1–4, X = F, Cl, and Br).

Conclusions
In summary, we report a joint study with laser ablation mass spectrometry
and theoretical calculation for Au2nCl– (n = 1–4) clusters. Systematic
theoretical calculations of these anions and their corresponding neutral
species were performed at the MP2 level to investigate their most
stable geometries and electron affinities. The results show that the
most stable isomers of Au2nCl– (n = 1–4) clusters have quite different
structures from their corresponding neutral species. The electron
affinities of Au2nCl (n = 1–4) are greatly enhanced by the doping of chlorine atoms.
The most striking fact is that the EA of Au2Cl is found
to be 4.02 eV, indicating that it can be identified as a unique multimetal
superhalogen. For Au4Cl, Au6Cl, and Au8Cl, although their electron affinities are below than that of chlorine
atoms, their VDEs increased about 60%, compared to the corresponding
pure Au4, Au6, and Au8 clusters.
NPA charge analyses were performed to trace the origin of their high
electron affinities. The predominant delocalization of the extra electron
over the previously positively charged metal moieties in anionic clusters
is the main reason for their large electron affinities of Au2nCl clusters. HOMO analyses are also applied and the
results are consistent. Considering the species diversity of the gold-related
clusters and their structure diversities, this study also examined
Au2nF (n = 1–4)
and Au2nBr (n = 1–4)
clusters, and similar results have been obtained.

Methods
Experimental
Section
Experiments were performed on
a 7.0 T FT ICR mass spectrometer (Varian IonSpec, Lake Forest, CA,
U.S.). It is equipped with a ProMALDI ion source by using a 355 nm
Nd:YAG laser (Orion, New Wave). The AuCl4H sample (Energy
Chemical) was prepared in water at a concentration of 2 mg/mL just
before the experiment. The graphene sample (Timesnano Company) was
dispersed in acetone with a concentration of 1 mg/mL by sonication
for 10 min prior to usage. Then, 1 μL dispersion of graphene
was applied onto the stainless target spot first, after it dried up,
1 μL solution of AuCl4H was then added on the same
spot. The target was then dried in air and placed into the source
region of a FT ICR mass spectrometer. The mass spectrum in this work
was measured in negative ion mode.

Computational
All calculations were performed with
the Gaussian 09 program.55 The reliability
of the MP2 method for gold has been clearly proven by previous studies.56−58 In our work, theoretical calculations were carried out at the MP2
level with the Stuttgart energy-consistent relativistic pseudopotentials
ECP60MDF and the corresponding valence basis set of MDF60 for Au and
aug-cc-pVTZ for F, Cl, and Br.59−61 Spin–orbit calculations
are not performed here, thus the numerical results might change slightly,
but the main conclusion should not. In order to further verify the
accuracy of the calculation results, single point calculations were
also done with the CCSD(T) method for Au2nCl (n = 1–3). The results are shown in Table S3, and similar results have been obtained.
Vibrational frequency analyses were performed for all the optimized
structures on the same level to confirm that no imaginary frequencies
are present. In addition, the reported electronic energies of all
structures were calculated at 0 K with zero-point energy corrections.
Different spin states including: singlet, triplet, and quintet spin
states for even-electron systems and doublet, quartet, and sextet
spin states for odd-electron systems were calculated. NBO analyses
were performed to obtain charge distributions in Au2nCl– and Au2nCl
clusters (n = 1–4).
