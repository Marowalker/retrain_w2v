Ni
and NiSn supported on zirconia (ZrO2) and on indium
(In)-incorporated zirconia (InZrO2) catalysts were prepared
by a wet chemical reduction route and tested for hydrogenation of
CO2 to methanol in a fixed-bed isothermal flow reactor
at 250 °C. The mono-metallic Ni (5%Ni/ZrO2) catalysts
showed a very high selectivity for methane (99%) during CO2 hydrogenation. Introduction of Sn to this material with the following
formulation 5Ni5Sn/ZrO2 (5% Ni-5% Sn/ZrO2) showed
the rate of methanol formation to be 0.0417 μmol/(gcat·s) with 54% selectivity. Furthermore, the combination NiSn
supported on InZrO2 (5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2) exhibited
a rate of methanol formation 10 times higher than that on 5Ni/ZrO2 (0.1043 μmol/(gcat·s)) with 99% selectivity
for methanol. All of these catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
CO2-temperature-programmed desorption, and density functional
theory (DFT) studies. Addition of Sn to Ni catalysts resulted in the
formation of a NiSn alloy. The NiSn alloy particle size was kept in
the range of 10–15 nm, which was evidenced by HRTEM study.
DFT analysis was carried out to identify the surface composition as
well as the structural location of each element on the surface in
three compositions investigated, namely, Ni28Sn27, Ni18Sn37, and Ni37Sn18 bimetallic nanoclusters, and results were in agreement with the
STEM and electron energy-loss spectroscopy results. Also, the introduction
of “Sn” and “In” helped improve the reducibility
of Ni oxide and the basic strength of catalysts. Considerable details
of the catalytic and structural properties of the Ni, NiSn, and NiSnIn
catalyst systems were elucidated. These observations were decisive
for achieving a highly efficient formation rate of methanol via CO2 by the H2 reduction process with high methanol
selectivity.

1 Introduction
The
increasing demand for sustainable and environmentally benign
alternative energy resources can effectively replace the current natural
fossil fuel hydrocarbon sources in the near future.1 Carbon Capture technologies can be considered as an efficient
source of energy because it is easy to store, harvest, and transport.
According to several researchers, the catalytic conversion of abundant,
inexpensive, renewable, and nontoxic carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable fuels and chemicals is one of the most practical
routes for reducing CO2 emission, and from an economic
point of view also, it becomes an attractive C1 feedstock.2−4 Hence, the production of methanol via CO2 hydrogenation
could substitute global dependence on fossil fuels.5 Methanol has wide range of applications in the chemical
industry as a starting component for the production of various upstream
and downstream value-added products (e.g., methanol to olefins process).
Also, methanol itself can be used as an alternative transportation
fuel for both gasoline- and diesel-powered engines because of its
efficient combustion, ease of transportation, and wide availability
around the globe.6−8 Industrial production of methanol is usually made
from syngas over tricomponent Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts
under mild temperatures (200–300 °C) and high pressures
(5–10 MPa).9,10

Furthermore, various promoters
(Ga, Mg, In, and La) in combination
with various metals (such as Cu, Pt, and Pd) have been used for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, and they showed efficient activity
and stability.11,12 In comparison with that of noble
metal catalysts, the use of Ni with promoters dispersed over the support
for the hydrogenation reaction is one of the most efficient ways because
of its wide availability and low cost.13 However, a supported monometallic Ni-based catalyst shows predominant
selectivity to methane via CO2 hydrogenation14 and also demonstrated poor stability during
the time-on-stream because it has a high tendency to form coke and
to sinter.14

Apart from traditional
catalysts, scientists have been trying to
develop catalysts different from the classical copper-based catalysts
for the production of methanol via CO2 hydrogenation. The
nickel–gallium intermetallic catalyst was shown to exhibit
improved activity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol under
mild conditions.15 Similarly, mesoporous
spinel cobalt oxide supported on manganese oxide was found to form
methanol in high yield via CO2 hydrogenation but with concomitant
production of hydrocarbons.16 Recently,
a trimetallic combination Ni–In–Al supported on phyllosilicate
showed efficient activity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol
at low pressure; however, the selectivity for CO is higher than that
for methanol.17 Still, there is an important
aspect of studying CO2 hydrogenation in favor of methanol
production at atmospheric pressure by designing catalysts that effectively
suppress the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) along with the
formation of other by-products.

Supported Ni catalysts have
been used in combination with
Sn as a promoter for various reactions such as ethylene adsorption
and ethane and propane dehydrogenation, they could be considered as
efficient bimetallic catalysts for various important transformations.18−23 Dumesic24 reported that the stability
of Ni was improved by involving Sn as a promoter and also that the
combination of Ni and Sn catalysts exhibited a remarkable increase
in the selectivity toward the formation of hydrogen from biomass-derived
hydrocarbons as compared to that of monometallic Ni, which predominantly
showed enhanced selectivity toward the production of alkanes but further
led to the formation of coke.24 Although
copper is usually claimed to be the main component of the active site
for the synthesis of methanol from CO2 hydrogenation, indium,
as In2O3, has recently been shown to play an
efficient role for activation of CO2. This promoting effect
of In2O3 has subsequently been proven by several
researchers with the help of density functional theory (DFT).25−27

The tentative intuitive explanation behind the above-mentioned
observations stems from the fact that hydrogenation of CO2 over the Ni catalyst is mainly responsible for methane production,
whereas CO2 hydrogenation catalyzed by NiSn results in
methanol production by suppressing methane formation. Moreover, the
use of indium as a promoter would improve CO2 hydrogenation
activity with effective formation rate of methanol.

With these
intuitive hypotheses, we decided to prepare bimetallic
catalysts based on Ni and Sn and also trimetallic catalysts Ni/Sn/In.
The choice of ZrO2 as a support was based on its high thermal
stability and unique acidic and basic properties.28−30 Also, the strong
anchoring effects and partial activation of CO2 by Zr4+ may efficiently enhance CO2 reduction.31

We disclose here that our new catalyst
combination associating
Ni, Sn, and In over ZrO2, e.g., 5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2, employed in the present investigation exhibits high rate of formation
of methanol (0.1043 μmol/(gcat·s)) with very
high selectivity for methanol and shows stable performance with time-on-stream
with a stability of up to 50 h.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
The textural properties
of Ni and NiSn supported on ZrO2 and on InZrO2 catalysts are summarized in Table T1,
Supporting Information. The surface area of catalyst samples is constant,
which is in the range of 98–99 m2/g. As can be seen
from literature study, there was no change observed in the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area with the addition “Sn” to Ni-supported
catalysts.24 Also, there is no certain
change in other textual properties such as pore volume (cm3/g) and pore diameter (Å). The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) results
given in Table T2 (Supporting Information)
show that the values of real contents of the samples are similar to
the nominal values discussed.

XRD patterns for Ni and NiSn supported
on ZrO2 and InZrO2 are shown in Figure 1; the presence of peaks at
2θ = 30.55, 35.40, 50.70, and 60.35° can be attributed
to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) diffraction planes of the tetragonal
zirconia. This implies that no obvious phases of Ni and NiSn were
observed in the diffraction patterns, which could be due to uniform
distribution of metals and metal oxides within the matrix of support
and/or low loading of both metals, thereby forming a homogeneous phase
of the composite catalyst.32 The diffraction
patterns of the spent 5Ni/ZrO2 and 5Ni/10InZrO2 catalyst samples are shown in Figure 2, which exhibited a peak at 2θ = 43.5° corresponding
to the (111) metallic phase of Ni along with the tetragonal phase
of ZrO2. This clear diffraction peak corresponds to the
metallic Ni, suggesting the transformation of nickel oxide to metallic
Ni. However, the addition of Sn to 5Ni/ZrO2 and 5Ni/10InZrO2 showed new peaks; these diffraction peaks correspond to the
NiSn alloy, without any other index peak for metallic Ni.33 These new phases of NixSny alloy formation quite resemble with
those of the Ni3Sn2 alloy, but the presence
of NiSn and Ni3Sn4 alloys cannot be ruled out.34 This study indicates that the introduction of
Sn would help inhibit the formation of metallic Ni phases, which is
mainly responsible for the formation of coke and methane.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of spent catalyst samples (reaction conditions: T = 250 °C, P = 25 bar, gas flow (CO2/Ar/H2) = 5/5/15 mL/min, weight hourly space velocity
(WHSV) 30 000 h–1, CO2/H2 = 1:3, time = 24 h).

The 5Ni/ZrO2 catalyst morphology in Figure S1a shows no distinguishable particles
of Ni and Ni
oxide with a very poor dispersion in the matrix of zirconia. Then,
involvement of Sn in Ni-supported catalysts showed that NiSn particles
are embedded in the layered structure with a chain bead morphology
in the matrix of the ZrO2 support (Figure S1b). Furthermore, this is more evidenced by NiSn supported
on InZrO2; this morphology possesses similar features as
discussed above and also kept particle size in the range of 10–20
nm with a very high dispersion of the NiSn alloy (Figure S1c,d).

To get more characterization details,
these catalyst samples were
analyzed using the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
technique. It can be seen that the monometallic Ni supported on ZrO2 showed similar features as discussed above under high magnification
and that there is likely agglomeration of Ni particles located on
the zirconia support (Figure 3a,b). However, both 5Ni5Sn/ZrO2 and 5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2 catalysts consisting of Sn species were mixed uniformly and
coexisted closely with Ni species, which is further confirmed by the
formation of NiSn alloy. These results are in good agreement with
the above XRD studies (Figure 3c–f). Furthermore, elemental mapping along with energy-dispersive
system spectrometry (EDS) was also conducted to get a clear vision
of the elemental distribution of Ni and NiSn supported on ZrO2 and InZrO2. As can be seen from this study, there
is distinct layer formation of Ni, presented in green, which is associated
with the ZrO2 support (Figure 4a,b). On the other hand, the Ni associated
with Sn reveals the formation of NiSn alloy (Figure 4c,d), which is presented in green and blue,
anchored to the zirconia support. We consider that both particles
of Ni and Sn are most likely of the NiSn alloy located on the surface
of zirconia, whereas metallic Ni constitutes the core of the nanocluster
and Sn is located as a shell with wide distribution to form a core–shell
structure, which resembles with high-magnification and elemental mapping
studies (Figure S2). Moreover, the NiSnIn
system is shown in tricolors, as green, blue, and magenta (Figure 4e,f), and this elemental
mapping study indicates that the formation of the NiSn alloy is higher
than that of both supported catalysts. This may arise due to homogeneous
NiSn alloy particles. Aforementioned observations suggest that the
addition of Sn to Ni-supported catalysts will help prevent aggregation
of metallic Ni species and favor the formation of NiSn alloy and thus
avoid undesired hydrogenation reactions, which is clearer with 5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2 catalysts showing efficient formation rate of methanol with
99% selectivity.

To determine the oxidation state
of nickel and tin, high-resolution
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Ni 2p, Sn 3d, and
In 3d core levels were obtained for the 5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2 catalyst before and after the reaction, as indicated in Figures 5–7. The Ni 2p core-level spectrum (Figure 5a) shows two intense peaks
at around ∼855.6 and 871.1 eV binding energies, attributed
to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, accompanied
by those of their corresponding satellites at around ∼861.2
and 879.6 eV.35−37 These peaks are attributed to Ni in the form of oxide
and hydroxide phases.38 Additionally, a
peak located at 852.1 eV in Figure 5b indicates that the metallic nickel (Ni0) phase is present on the catalyst surface. The Sn 3d core-level
spectra (Figure 6a)
show two intense peaks at around ∼486.2 and 494.6 eV binding
energies, attributed to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, respectively. The Sn 3d5/2 peak was fitted using three
components located at 484.2, 486.2, and 487.1 eV, assigned to Sn0 and Sn2+ in SnO and Sn4+ in SnO2, respectively (Figure 6b).39−41 Moreover, the XPS results show that after the reaction
the concentration of both metallic nickel and tin increases, indicated
by increasing both Ni and Sn metallic peak intensities. The In 3d
core-level spectra (Figure 7a,b) show two intense peaks at around ∼444.09
and 451.67 eV binding energies corresponding to the In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 states, respectively. These obtained binding
energy values are associated with the In+3 oxidation state
in the form of In oxide (In2O3).

This reduction did not occur for
monometallic 5Ni/ZrO2 because we did not observe any peak
corresponding to the metallic
Ni (Figure S3a). This observation suggests
that the combination of both metallic Ni and Sn (Figure S3b,c) may consist of different forms of NiSn alloys,
which is in good accordance with XRD and TEM results.

We investigate
the reducibility of supported Ni catalysts with
Sn and In species (Figure 8). The monometallic 5Ni/ZrO2 catalyst temperature-programmed
reduction (TPR) profile exhibits sharp shoulder peaks with a tail
in the temperature range from 325 to 600 °C, and these observations
suggest that the reduction of nickel oxide to metallic Ni requires
high reduction temperature.42−44 Furthermore, for Ni supported
on the InZrO2 catalyst, the TPR profile shows a very broad
peak in the range of 300–700 °C, and the nature of peak
confirms that there are several types of Ni and In oxide species with
different ease-of-reducibility patterns. However, both NiSn supported
on ZrO2 and InZrO2 catalysts possess two reduction
peaks at 570 and 798 °C, which are indexed to the Ni and Sn oxide
reduction profiles. The incorporation of Sn to supported Ni catalysts
helps ease NiO reducibility, as evidenced by the shift of the peak
maxima to lower reduction temperatures at 350 and 357 °C, respectively.
Also, use of In further results in an increase in Ni and Sn oxide
reducibility, as demonstrated by a shift of peaks to a lower temperature
and a decrease in intensity. Moreover, the addition of Sn favors NiSn
alloy formation, which is further confirmed by the low reduction temperature
required in the presence of NiO because of the small crystallite size,
which is closely related to XRD and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) results discussed above.

of as-prepared supported Ni catalysts.

CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) study
(Figure 9) shows that
the
monometallic 5Ni/ZrO2 catalyst possesses three distinct
CO2 desorption peaks mainly in the low (200–300
°C)- and medium (300–500 °C)-temperature regions,
and this confirmed that CO2 weakly adsorbed on the catalyst
surface. As reported in the literature, the weak basic sites may ascribe
to the linear adsorption of CO2, whereas the strong basic
sites may result from the bridge adsorption of CO2.45,46 In contrast, the addition of Sn to the 5Ni/ZrO2 catalyst
resulted in two CO2 desorption peaks in the regions of
250–500 °C, medium strong site region, and 450–650
°C, strong site region, which indicate the formation of new CO2 absorption sites on the catalyst surface. Indeed, the involvement
of Sn helps modify basic sites of 5Ni/ZrO2 catalysts, but
the use of In acts as a promoting agent to improve the basic strength
by CO2 absorption sites in both medium and strong regions.
This study implies that the incorporation of Sn into the supported
5Ni/ZrO2 catalyst may create new basic sites for CO2 adsorption.

2.2 Catalytic
Activity
The results of
the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 using supported nickel
catalysts at 250 °C, 25 bar, and a weight hourly space velocity
(WHSV) of 30 000 h–1 are summarized in Figures 10, 11, and 12. The major products were methanol
(MeOH), methane (CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO). All catalytic
data were taken when the catalyst reached a steady state. The effect
of Sn with 5Ni/ZrO2 and 5Ni/10InZrO2 on the
catalytic performance was assessed in terms of the formation rate
of methanol per gram of catalysts. Initially, Sn (5Sn/10InZrO2)- and In (10InZrO2)-supported zirconia catalysts
showed a very low formation rate of methanol via CO2 hydrogenation.
On other hand, the use of Ni without Sn as a catalyst mainly favored
the formation of methane, whereas all other catalyst combinations
showed selectivity toward methanol formation (Figure S4).

Figure 10 Formation rate of methanol (reaction conditions: T = 250 °C, P = 25 bar, gas flow (CO2/Ar/H2) = 5/5/15 mL/min, WHSV 30 000 h–1, CO2/H2 = 1:3, time = 24 h).

Figure 11 Formation rate of methanol (reaction
conditions: T = 250 °C, P =
25 bar, gas flow (CO2/Ar/H2) = 5/5/15 mL/min,
WHSV 30 000 h–1, CO2/H2 = 1:3, time = 24 h; catalysts: 1 =
5Ni/ZrO2, 2 = 5Ni/10InZrO2, 3 = 5Ni5Sn/ZrO2, 4 = 5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2, 5 = 10Ni5Sn/10InZrO2, 6 = 5Ni10Sn/10InZrO2).

Figure 12 Selectivity patterns for catalysts 1 = 5Ni/ZrO2, 2 = 5Ni/10InZrO2, 3 = 5Ni5Sn/ZrO2, 4 = 5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2, 5 = 10Ni5Sn/10InZrO2, 6 =
5Ni10Sn/10InZrO2 (reaction conditions: T = 250 °C, P = 25 bar, gas flow (CO2/Ar/H2) = 5/5/15 mL/min, WHSV 30 000 h–1, CO2/H2 = 1:3, time = 24 h).

Also, monometallic nickel catalyst 5Ni/ZrO2 showed nil
activity toward the formation rate of methanol; this is proven by
complete selectivity for the production of methane (99%). The addition
of In to the 5Ni/ZrO2 catalyst resulted in a similar observation;
there is no observable methanol formation, which is also due to the
high selectivity to methane (99%). As a consequence, monometallic
Ni and NiIn species supported on ZrO2 are poor for methanol
formation. Interestingly, Sn incorporation in 5Ni/ZrO2 initiates
the formation of methanol, which is about 0.0417 (μmol/(gcat·s)) with an increase in selectivity to methanol about
54%. Moreover, the combination of Ni and Sn supported on InZrO2 predominantly increases the formation rate of methanol (1.043
μmol/(gcat·s)) along with an increase in selectivity
to methanol (99%) and a concomitant decrease in selectivity to methane.
In order to improve formation rate of methanol, we varied the Ni/Sn
ratio, and with an increase in the concentration of Ni (10Ni5Sn/10InZrO2), a marginal decrease in the methanol formation
rate (0.0798 μmol/(gcat·s)) was observed, which could be
due to the increase in selectivity for methane. However, the increase
in the concentration of Sn (5Ni10Sn/10InZrO2) did not affect
the formation rate of methanol (0.093 μmol/(gcat·s)),
but it is more favorable for CO selectivity (22%). Ideally, the use
of Sn as a co-metal would help alter the selectivity toward methanol
than toward methane and also the NiSnIn catalyst combination helps
improve the catalytic activity toward methanol selectivity as well
as the production rate via CO2 hydrogenation. Recently,
Fan et al. revealed that the trimetallic Ni–In–Al combination
shows an effective formation rate of methanol but suffers from poor
selectivity to methanol, which is in the range of only 1–2%.17 However, our catalyst combination possesses
not only high selectivity to methanol but also comparable formation
rate of methanol. The excellent catalytic performance of our NiSn
catalyst supported on InZrO2 can be explained as follows:
(i) Sn incorporation into Ni helps in the formation of the NiSn alloy,
(ii) advantage of Sn for ease of reducibility of Ni while using predominant
oxide supports such as In oxide and ZrO2, (iii) Sn also
plays an important role in increasing the basic strength of catalysts
toward facile CO2 hydrogenation activity, and (iv) the
tricomponent (NiSnIn) showed consistent activity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol during the time-on-stream study.

The effect of In loading (1, 5, and 10%), by keeping the NiSn (5Ni5Sn)
concentration constant, on the formation rate of methanol was studied
(Figure 13). It was
observed that the formation rate of methanol increases from 0.043
to 0.1043 μmol/(gcat·s) with the increasing
In loading from 1 to 10% at a constant temperature of 250 °C.
The highest methanol formation rate was achieved by 5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2, which is approximately 10 times higher than the formation
rate of monometallic 5Ni/ZrO2 catalyst, as against there
is no such noticeable effect of In loadings on the selectivity of
methanol up to 10%. This clearly confirms that In acts as a promoter
in the NiSn combination for selective CO2 conversion with
efficient formation rate of methanol.

Figure 13 Effect of In loading
on the formation rate of methanol (reaction
conditions: T = 225–275 °C, P = 25 bar, gas flow (CO2/Ar/H2) = 5/5/15 mL/min,
WHSV 30 000 h–1, CO2/H2 = 1:3, time = 24 h).

The effect of reaction pressure on CO2 hydrogenation
was studied for 1, 10, and 25 bar over two different catalysts (5Ni5Sn/ZrO2 and 5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2), by keeping all other experimental
parameters same, is shown in Figure 14. As stated in the literature, high pressure is necessary
for selective hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol, which is
controlled by the kinetics and thermodynamics of CO2 hydrogenation.47−50 It can be seen that the results of both catalysts resulted in a
linear increase in the methanol formation rate with an increase in
the reaction pressure. It can be found that the formation rate of
methanol for 5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2 catalysts is in the range
0.039–0.1043 μmol/(gcat·s) from 1 to
25 bar total pressure. The measurable difference observed with the
involvement of In as a promoter to NiSn catalysts is that it results
in a 2-fold high methanol formation rate as compared to that with
NiSn-ZrO2 catalysts within the pressure range studied.
This is mainly because NiSn supported on InZrO2 results
in more NiSn alloy formation along with high basic strength of catalysts,
which is confirmed by high selectivity to methanol discussed earlier
in Figure 13.

Figure 14 Effect of
reaction pressure on the methanol formation rate (reaction
conditions: T = 250 °C, P =
5–15–25 bar, gas flow (CO2/Ar/H2) = 5/5/15 mL/min, WHSV 30 000 h–1, CO2/H2 = 1:3, time = 24 h).

The hydrogenation of CO2 over 5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2 was studied by variation of total flow rate (space velocity)
with
different reaction temperatures from 225 to 275 °C and keeping
all other parameters constant (Figure 15). As expected, the formation rate of methanol
is linearly increased with the increasing reaction temperature from
225 to 275 °C and flow rate from 12.5 to 37.5 mL/min. Also, at
high reaction temperature, 275 °C, and total flow rate, 37.5
mL/min, the formation rate of methanol is very high (0.176 μmol/(gcat·s)). Because this goes through an increase in the
total flow rate, it showed a decrease in the contact time with the
catalyst bed; hence, the formation rate of methanol is limited to
the feed total flow. Although the formation rate of methanol increases
linearly with the total flow rate (12.5, 20, and 37.5 mL/min) and
temperature variation from 225 to 275 °C, it suffers from selectivity,
which is discussed more clearly with a contact time study further.
Also, the effect of temperature on 5Sn/10InZrO2 for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol was estimated (Figure S5). Upon increasing the reaction temperature from
225 to 275 °C, the formation rate of methanol was enhanced up
to 0.0275 μmol/(gcat·s), but the selectivity
to methanol was decreased with a concomitant increase in the CO selectivity.

Figure 15 Effect
of feed flow rate on the methanol formation rate with different
reaction temperatures over 5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2 (reaction conditions: T = 225–275 °C, P = 25 bar,
feed flow ration (CO2/Ar/H2) = 1:1:3, WHSV 15 000–45 000
h–1, CO2/H2 = 1:3, time =
24 h).

The hydrogenation of CO2 over 5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2 was studied with respect to contact
time, and the methanol selectivity
results are presented in Figure 16. To check in a more rational way, different catalyst
weights were used for CO2 reduction to obtain different
contact times at a constant total feed flow and studied in the temperature
range from 225 to 275 °C. The selectivity to methanol decreases
linearly at all reaction temperatures from 225 to 275 °C. Therefore,
we can consider that the reactor is operating in a differential mode.
At low contact time and at low temperature, the selectivity to methanol
is high (around >99%). A further increase in both the residence
time
(0.078–0.24 L/(g·s)) and the reaction temperature (225–275 °C)
leads to a decrease in the selectivity of MeOH from 99 to 54% at the
cost of selectivity to CO formation. In contrast, the catalyst showed
high rate for RWGS to produce CO instead of methanol. It was clearly
observed that low catalyst amount and contact time retain high selectivity
to methanol. As against, the optimized reaction condition 250 °C
with contact time (0.12 L/(g·s)) showed very high selectivity
to methanol. Hence, the NiSn combination supported on InZrO2 catalysts shows more favorable selectivity to methanol than CO;
thus, these results indicate that the catalyst composition would be
more facile to revert methane and CO selectivity to methanol via CO2 hydrogenation.

contact time over

h–1, CO2/H2 = 1:3, time 24
h).

Furthermore, we check the long-term
stability of optimized catalysts
5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2 using the time-on-stream stability test
by keeping all other parameters constant, as mentioned in Figure 11. As shown in Figure 17, the catalyst
sustained very high productivity with 0.1043 μmol/(gcat·s) formation rate of methanol over 50 h. Also, this catalyst
composition contains NiSn alloy formation, easy reducibility of NiO
due to the addition of Sn. Moreover, incorporation of Sn and In is
helpful in improving the basic strength, which act as a promoter and
stabilizer, and these components are main active components and support
the high formation rate of methanol through CO2 hydrogenation.
The high productivity of methanol with long-term stability shows that
this catalyst is active and stable for CO2 hydrogenation
to methanol.

2.3 DFT Calculations
Figure 18 shows the various explored
DFT-based atomic configurations of the 55-atom Ni28Sn27 bimetallic nanocluster (Ni/Sn ratio of around 1, which is
very close to that of the obtained samples in our experiment) generated
from a substitution of 27 Ni atoms by 27 Sn atoms at different occupation
sites including core–shell and random alloy dispositions of
the 55-atom icosahedron Ni55 nanocluster. The relative
formation energy per total number of atoms was computed for each structural
configuration (given in brackets) to provide insight into the possible
structural evolution during heating treatment and to help identify
the surface composition of Ni–Sn bimetallic samples under catalytic
conditions. The lowest-energy structure (0 meV/atom) as well as the
less stable one by 44 meV/atom revealed similar core–shell
disposition, where the core is entirely occupied by Ni atoms, whereas
all Sn atoms are somehow dispersed on the overall surface, leading
to the formation of surface Sn–Ni and Sn–Sn bonds (Figure 18a,b). This result
indicates the probable presence of the Ni (core)–Sn (shell)
structure even beyond room temperature until around 510 K, which is
very close to the treatment temperature used in our catalytic tests.
The configuration showing almost full Sn segregation was found to
be 60 meV/atom less stable than the first case (Figure 18c) and thus this disposition
was expected to appear around 696 K. However, other configurations
displaying random alloylike structures, with minority of Sn atoms
incorporated into the core of the nanocluster and majority remaining
on the surface, were obtained at 76 and 88 meV/atom higher energy
than the lowest-energy one (Figure 18d,e). As a typical estimate, these atomic dispositions
could become significant at higher temperatures in the 890–1020
K range. In all cases, the obtained structures upon full geometry
optimization were found to be much distorted without any specific
morphology as compared with the initial icosahedral shape adopted
for pure Ni55.

Ni28Sn27 bimetallic nanocluster along with the
computed relative
formation energies (given in brackets) per total number of atoms (in
meV/atom) (Ni atoms are shown in light blue and Sn atoms in red):
(a) lowest-energy and (b–e) metastable structures.

By replacing 37 Ni atoms with 37 Sn atoms at various
occupation
sites including core–shell and random alloy dispositions into
the 55-atom icosahedron Ni55 nanocluster, we have then
explored the Sn-rich 55-atom Ni18Sn37 bimetallic
nanocluster structures (Ni/Sn ratio of around 0.5, which is very close
to that obtained for the samples in our experiment). The obtained
DFT-based optimized atomic configurations are displayed in Figure 19. The most stable
structural configuration at room temperature was obtained when all
Sn species are located on the surface and the core is fully occupied
by Ni atoms, leading to Ni (core)–Sn (shell) disposition (Figure 19a). The configuration
revealing a random alloylike structure, with a limited number of Sn
atoms incorporated into the core of the nanocluster and majority remaining
on the surface, was found less stable by 42 meV/atom than the previous
one (Figure 19b).
This result indicates the probable presence of an alloy structure
with the majority of Sn–Sn bonds on the surface at around 490
K, which is very close to the treatment temperature used in our catalytic
tests. However, the configuration showing a kind of Ni segregation
was found to be 68 meV/atom less stable than the first case (Figure 19c) and thus this
disposition was expected to appear at a relatively high temperature
(around 800 K). Similarly as obtained in the cases of Ni28Sn27, all of the obtained structures revealed a strong
distortion with respect to the initial icosahedral shape adopted for
pure Ni55. This clearly highlighted the substantial impact
of substituted Sn on the surface structures of the Sn-rich Ni–Sn
bimetallic catalysts.

the
relative formation energies (given in brackets) per total number of
atoms (in meV/atom) (Sn atoms are shown in red and Ni atoms in light
blue): (a) most stable and (b, c) metastable structures.

Finally, we have explored Ni-rich 55-atom Ni37Sn18 bimetallic nanocluster structures (Ni/Sn
ratio of around
2, which is very close to that obtained for the samples in our experiment)
by substituting 18 Ni atoms by 18 Sn atoms at different occupation
sites including core–shell and random alloy dispositions of
the 55-atom icosahedron Ni55 nanocluster. Figure 20 illustrates the key explored
DFT-based optimized atomic configurations. The lowest-energy structure
revealed a core–shell disposition, where the core is entirely
occupied by Ni atoms, whereas all Sn atoms are located on the surface
(Figure 20a), highlighting
this atomic disposition as the most stable one at room temperature.
However, the configuration displaying a random alloylike structure,
with a minority of Sn atoms incorporated into the core of the nanocluster
and the majority of Sn atoms well dispersed on the surface, was found
less stable by 47 meV/atom than the lowest-energy one (Figure 20b). This result indicated
the probable presence of a random alloylike structure with the formation
of surface Ni–Ni and Sn–Ni bonds at around 545 K, which
is very close to the treatment temperature used in our catalytic tests.
In contrast, the configuration showing almost full Sn segregation
was found to be 112 meV/atom less stable than the first one (Figure 20c) and thus this
disposition becomes significant at around 1300 K. Different from the
two previous Ni28Sn27 and Ni18Sn37 cases, the optimized atomic structures obtained for the
Ni-rich 55-atom Ni37Sn18 bimetallic nanocluster
revealed a much less distortion, keeping roughly the initial icosahedral
shape of the pure Ni55. In summary, DFT calculations showed
differences between the morphology, surface composition, and structural
location of each element on the surface of the three investigated
Ni28Sn27, Ni18Sn37, and
Ni37Sn18 bimetallic nanoclusters. This discrepancy
is relevant with different catalytic activity trends for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, and this aspect was discussed in the
activity results above in Figure 11and12.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the addition of Sn to Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/InZrO2 resulted in an enhancement in the formation rate of methanol
with an order of magnitude via CO2 hydrogenation. The selectivity
of the undesired methane and reverse water gas shift reaction was
substantially affected by Sn addition, the involvement of Sn showing
the change in the selectivity to methanol in the CO2 hydrogenation
reaction. The XRD, HRTEM, EELS, and XPS characterizations confirm
that the NiSn alloy as well as the Ni core and the Sn shell was formed.
Also, the addition of Sn helps in reducing the particle size of agglomerated
Ni particles and increases the reducibility of Ni oxide, which was
considered as an active site for hydrogenation reactions. This was
observed clearly with inhibition of the CO2 methanation
reaction, and selectivity to methanol was improved successfully to
99%. Furthermore, with an InZrO2 support, a dramatic increase
in the intrinsic activity for CO2 hydrogenation was obtained;
these results point out the bifunctional active sites where both NiSn
and In oxides were associated in methanol synthesis. These above-mentioned
findings are likely due to ease of reducibility of Ni oxide and increase
in basic strength of catalysts toward facile CO2 hydrogenation.

The possible structural evolution of Ni–Sn bimetallic samples
at the atomic level during the heating treatment has also been investigated
by DFT calculations to help identify their surface compositions under
catalytic conditions. The DFT study showed differences between the
morphology, surface composition, and structural location of each element
on the surface of the three investigated Ni28Sn27, Ni18Sn37, and Ni37Sn18 bimetallic nanoclusters. This was explicitly confirmed by the different
trends obtained in the catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Also, DFT calculations suggested
the formation of Ni (core)–Sn (shell) and random alloylike
atomic structures, which could apparently match with the STEM, EDS,
and elemental mapping studies. The excellent correlation between model
surfaces and supported catalysts demonstrated the feasibility of employing
this combined approach to guide the design of bimetallic catalysts
for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Nickel nitrate, indium
nitrate, zirconium nitrate, tin acetate, and sodium borohydride were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used directly. High-purity gases
(H2 99.9995%; CO2, Ar 99.9999%) were purchased
from the Specialty Gases Center of Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases
& Equipment Co. Ltd. (Saudi Arabia).

4.2 Catalyst
Preparation
4.2.1 Support Preparation
For this synthesis,
a Chemspeed I-synth platform was used. It allowed volumetric dispensing
of solutions and gravimetric dispensing of solids.

4.2.1.1 ZrO2 Support Preparation
First, 20 mL of
0.5 M K2CO3 was added dropwise
(dosing rate: 0.5 mL/min) to already prepared 20 mL of 0.5 M ZrO(NO3)2·H2O solution while stirring
at 500 rpm, allowing a well-controlled precipitation. After that,
the pH was adjusted by the pH control tool to 9.5. The resulting precipitate
was separated using a centrifuge at 8000 rpm for 10 min and washed
with deionized water three times and two times with ethanol.

4.2.1.2 10% InZrO2 Support Preparation
In, Zr, and
K2CO3 starting solutions were
prepared off-line and put on the platform at defined positions. In
and Zr precursor solutions were added together to result in a 20 mL
mixed solution having a total concentration of 0.25 M (In(NO3)2·3H2O) and 0.5 M ZrO(NO3)2·H2O with the desired ratio of In and Zr.
Then, 20 mL of 0.5 M K2CO3 was added dropwise
(dosing rate: 0.5 mL/min) to this solution while stirring at 500 rpm,
allowing a well-controlled precipitation. After that, the pH was adjusted
to 9.5. Then, the resulting precipitate was separated by using a centrifuge
at 8000 rpm for 10 min and washed with deionized water for three times
and two times with ethanol.

4.2.2 Wet
Chemical Reduction Method
Ni
and NiSn catalysts with various loadings on ZrO2 and InZrO2 supports were prepared by a wet chemical reduction method.
For the synthesis of 5Ni/ZrO2, a calculated amount of nickel(II)
nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in deionized water with 1 g of ZrO2 support (preparation procedure as given above) and stirred
for 30 min at a constant temperature of 90 °C. NaBH4 (99.999%) (metal/NaBH4 = 1:7) was dissolved in 20 mL
of deionized water and added dropwise to the solution. The reaction
was allowed to proceed for 3 h at 90 °C temperature for complete
reduction of the metal salt. After the reaction, the resulting sample
was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 5 min thrice to remove unwanted ions
and washed with excess deionized water. The catalyst was dried overnight
at 120 °C and used as prepared without any further heat treatment.

The 5Ni5Sn/ZrO2, 5Ni/10InZrO2, and 5Ni5Sn/10InZrO2 catalysts were prepared similarly as follows: calculated
amounts of nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate and tin acetate were dissolved
in deionized water with 1 g of ZrO2 and InZrO2 (prepared as above) supports and stirred for 30 min at a constant
temperature of 90 °C. NaBH4 (99.999%) (metal/NaBH4 = 1:7) was dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water and added
dropwise to the solution. The reaction was allowed to proceed for
3 h at 90 °C, the temperature necessary for a complete reduction
of the metal salt. After the reaction, the sample was centrifuged
at 7000 rpm for 5 min thrice to remove unwanted ions and washed with
excess deionized water. The catalyst was then dried overnight at 120
°C in the open air and used as such without any further heat
treatment.

4.3 Hydrogenation Experiments
and Analysis
All catalytic tests were conducted in the gas
phase using a fixed-bed
isothermal flow reactor purchased from Process Integral Development
Eng&Tech (PID Eng&Tech, Spain). In a typical experiment, 0.050–0.250
g of the as-prepared catalysts diluted with 0.950–0.750 g of
inert carborundum (vide supra) was loaded into a stainless steel (SS-316)
reactor (length 30 cm and 0.9 cm i.d.). The stainless steel tube was
equipped with a 20 μm (mesh size) porous plate made with Hastelloy
C, which was used to hold the catalyst inside the reactor. The reactor
was then heated to 250 °C (50 °C/min) under CO2, H2, and Ar (1:3:1 respective molar ratio) gas mixture
(CO2, 5 mL/min; H2, 15 mL/min; and Ar, 5 mL/min,
all of the flow values at NTP) with total feed flow (25 mL/min at
NTP). The pressure (1–25 bar) inside the reactor was controlled
using an automated micrometric valve.

Product gas analysis was
performed on-line using a Varian 450 GC gas chromatograph. A sample
from the reactor outlet stream was automatically injected on three
parallel channels referred to here as channel A, channel B, and channel
C. In channel A, the sample (1 mL at STP) was injected on a set of
three packed columns, “Hayesep” Q (CP81073), “Hayesep”
T (CP81072), and “Molsieve” 13× (CP81073) connected
in series. A set of 10-way and 6-way Valco valves was used to allow
automatic injection of the sample, back-flushing of Hayesep T, and
bypassing of “Molsieve” 13× columns. This channel
was equipped with a TCD detector (He as a reference gas) and used
to monitor the amounts of CO and CO2. Channel B used a
set of two capillary columns, CP-Wax 52CB (CP8553) as a precolumn
and Al2O3 MAPD (CP7432), connected in series.
This channel was used to monitor methane, ethane, and ethylene. Meanwhile,
channel C was equipped with a CP-wax 52CB column (CP7668) to separate
oxygenates. Channels B and C were equipped with a flame ionization
detector. A 10-way Valco valve was used to allow simultaneous injection
of the gas samples on both channels A (500 μL at STP was injected)
and B (250 μL at STP was injected). Estimation of CO2 conversion was made directly from the carbon balance based on the
product concentrations for which the sensitivity is higher. The formation
rate of methanol is defined in micromoles produced per gram of the
catalyst per second.

4.4 Catalyst Characterization
Surface
area measurements were carried out using N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) on a Micromeretics
ASAP2420 instrument. The surface areas of the samples were analyzed
using the multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model.
Prior to these measurements, the catalyst samples were degassed under
vacuum at 250 °C for 2 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for
all samples were collected using a Bruker D8 Advanced A25 diffractometer
with Cu K radiation, which is operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The data
sets were acquired in the step scan mode in the 2θ range of
20–80°, using a step interval of 0.05° and a counting
time of 10°/min.

Morphology of all samples was characterized
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), using a Titan 80-300 ST
microscope from Thermo-Fisher Scientific. This microscope was equipped
with a probe-corrector to perform the Cs-corrected scanning STEM analysis.
It was also equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer
(EDS) and a post-column energy filter for the determination of the
elemental composition of samples by acquiring EDS and electron energy-loss
spectroscopy (EELS) spectra, respectively. The specimens for this
analysis were prepared by mixing the powdered samples in a pure ethanol
solution. A small amount (<5 μL) of resultant solution from
each sample was then placed on Holey-carbon-coated copper grids. These
grids were then air-dried at ambient condition for several hours before
performing the analysis. STEM imaging of the samples was completed
by operating the microscope at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV,
and the images were recorded using a high-angle annular dark-field
(HAADF) detector and were recorded by setting the microscope in a
given range of magnifications. Both EDS and core-loss EELS spectra
were acquired by placing the electron beam on samples for several
seconds. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were
also acquired in the TEM mode to investigate the crystal structure
of samples. At the end, spectrum-imaging (SI) data sets in the STEM-EELS
configuration were also acquired to investigate the distribution of
elements in the samples.

H2 temperature-programmed
reduction (H2-TPR)
measurements were carried out using an Altamira Instrument (AMi-200Ip)
equipped with a TCD detector to measure the H2 uptake.
The catalyst sample (about 0.0250 g) was kept in a U-shaped quartz
tube and pretreated under Ar flow (50 mL/min) for 2 h at 250 °C
to remove moisture and other surface impurities present in the sample.
Furthermore, the sample was allowed to cool down at room temperature
under the flow of Ar. Finally, the temperature was raised from 50
to 750 °C (10 °C/min) under a flow of 5% H2/Ar
(50 mL/min).

High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was used
to study the chemical composition and oxidation state of the catalyst
surfaces. XPS studies were carried out using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD
spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source
(hν = 1486.6 eV) operating at 150 W, a multichannel
plate, and a delay line detector under a vacuum of 1 × 10–9 mbar. The survey and high-resolution spectra were
recorded at fixed analyzer pass energies of 160 and 20 eV, respectively,
and quantified using empirically derived relative sensitivity factors
provided by Kratos analytical. Samples were mounted in floating mode
to avoid differential charging. Charge neutralization was required
for all samples. Binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak
of C–C and C–H bonds, which was set at 284.8 eV. The
data were analyzed with commercially available software (CasaXPS).

Before CO2-TPD, the catalyst samples (about 0.0250 g)
were first reduced in 5% H2/Ar at 50 mL/min for 2 h at
300 °C. Then, the gas was changed to 1% CO2/He with
50 mL/min at 50 °C and kept for 1 h. TPD was performed under
Ar flow at 50 mL/min to study the basic strength of the catalysts.
The temperature was increased from 50 to 750 °C at the ramp rate
of 10 °C/min. The effluent gases also were analyzed on a mass
spectrometer (MS) (Hiden Analytical).

4.5 DFT Computations
For structural simulations
of bimetallic Ni–Sn nanoclusters, we considered as a starting
material the initial 55-atom geometrical model of the nickel Ni55 nanocluster with the commonly observed FCC-derived icosahedral
shape containing 42 atoms on the surface and 13 atoms in the core.
Several key atomic configurations of bimetallic Ni–Sn nanoclusters
were modeled, in which 27, 37, and 18 Ni atoms were substituted by
27, 37, and 18 Sn atoms at different sites including core–shell
and random alloy dispositions, to mimic the three samples obtained
experimentally with Ni/Sn ratios of around 1, 0.5, and 2, respectively.
The relative formation energy was systematically computed for each
structural configuration to give a hint about the possible structural
evolution during the heating treatment to help identify the surface
composition of these nanoparticles under catalytic conditions.

Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) together with the
plane wave approach as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation
Package51−54 were applied for total energy calculations of the various explored
bimetallic Ni–Sn bimetallic structures. Each nanocluster was
incorporated into a relatively large vacuum box to avoid any possible
interaction with neighboring nanoclusters introduced by the periodic
boundary conditions. The Perdew–Burke–Emzerhof exchange-correlation
functional55 and the projector-augmented
plane wave approach56 were employed to
describe the electron–electron and electron–ion interactions,
respectively. The convergence criterion for the electronic self-consistent-field
cycles was fixed at 10–5 eV. To obtain reliable
computed electronic energies of the simulated bimetallic Ni–Sn
nanoclusters, the atomic coordinates were fully relaxed until the
three components of the Hellmann–Feynman forces on each atom
reached values below 10–2 eV/Å.
