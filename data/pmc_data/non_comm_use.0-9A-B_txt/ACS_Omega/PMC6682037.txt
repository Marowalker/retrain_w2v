Visible
light-driven Ag2S-grafted NiO–ZnO ternary
nanocomposites are synthesized using a facile and cost-effective homogeneous
precipitation method. The structural, morphological, and optical properties
were extensively studied, confirming the formation of ternary nanocomposites.
The surface area of the synthesized nanocomposites was calculated
by electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl). Ternary Ag2S/NiO–ZnO nanocomposites
showed excellent visible light photocatalytic property which increases
further with the concentration of Ag2S. The maximum photocatalytic
activity was shown by 8% Ag2S/NiO–ZnO with a RhB
degradation efficiency of 95%. Hydroxyl and superoxide radicals were
found to be dominant species for photodegradation of RhB, confirmed
by scavenging experiments. It is noteworthy that the recycling experiments
demonstrated high stability and recyclable nature of the photocatalyst.
Moreover, the electrochemical results indicated that the prepared
nanocomposite exhibits remarkable activity toward detection of acetone.
The fabricated nanocomposite sensor showed high sensitivity (4.0764 μA
mmol L–1 cm–2) and a lower detection
limit (0.06 mmol L–1) for the detection of acetone.
The enhanced photocatalytic and the sensing property of Ag2S/NiO–ZnO can be attributed to the synergistic effects of
strong visible light absorption, excellent charge separation, and
remarkable surface properties.

1 Introduction
Environmental
imbalance due to fading of natural resources, rise
in greenhouse gases, and growing pollution through urbanization and
industrialization is a global concern.1,2 The unchecked
and untreated discharges into the environment pose serious threat
to both biotic and abiotic components of the environment.3,4 Researchers across the globe have devoted their efforts to check
these issues by developing smarter and advanced technologies for sustainable
future. From past few decades, semiconducting metal oxide nanostructures
have received considerable attention owing to their novel characteristics
and potential applications. The distinguished features of the metal
oxide nanomaterials are remarkably assessed for remediation of the
environment through various processes such as photocatalysis, hazardous
chemical sensing, wastewater decontamination, and solar energy conversion
and storage.5−9 Semiconductor nanomaterials have the potential to degrade organic
pollutants such as textile dyes, drugs, and fertilizers and to simultaneously
find excellent applications such as chemosensors for the detection
of acetone, formaldehyde, ammonia, LPG, and alcohols.10−13

Semiconductor photocatalysis is the advanced oxidation technique
to be researched for the treatment of multiple contaminants including
textile dyes, pesticides, and biphenyls.14−16 Semiconductor
photocatalysis, an advanced oxidation process, involves the formation
of highly reactive species upon absorption of light, which can degrade
the plethora of pollutants.17 However,
the large band gap semiconductors suffer a drawback, that is, they absorb
UV light which is only 4% of the solar spectrum. To shift the absorption
of these semiconductors to the visible region, several procedures
are followed, such as metal ion doping,18,19 heterostructure
fabrication,20,21 formation of polymer nanocomposites,22 and metal organic frameworks.23 To further improve the visible light response and photocatalytic
performance, ternary composites are preferred.24,25 Ternary nanocomposites are promising materials for usage as photocatalysts,
electrochemical sensors, and energy storage devices and exhibit improved
light absorption and power density, improved stability, and better
catalytic activity.

Semiconductor nanomaterials have also been
studied as chemosensors
because of their remarkable variation in electrical resistance on
exposure to target analytes and excellent chemical stability.26,27 An ideal chemosensor is one which operates at room temperature,
possesses high sensitivity and reproducibility, fast response and
recovery time, low detection limit, and low cost, and is eco-friendly.28 Nanomaterials have been utilized as effective
and efficient chemical sensors for the detection of hazardous and
toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the environment.29 Semiconductor metal oxides such as SnO2,30 ZnO,31 In2O3,32 TiO2,33 NiO,34 and
Fe2O335 have been
investigated as potential sensors for the detection of toxic chemicals
from the environment. Chemosensors based on heterostructured nanomaterials
have received much attention as compared to enzymatic sensors owing
to their reliable, sensitive, simpler, and economical approach.36

ZnO is a n-type semiconductor with a wide
band gap of 3.3 (eV)
having high electron mobility. ZnO turns out to be an efficient photocatalyst
for pollutant degradation because of its excellent redox properties.37,38 Moreover, ZnO has been studied in chemical sensing because of its
intriguing properties such as low cost, good thermal and chemical
stability, and better electronic properties. However, because of wide
band gaps, absorption is restricted to the UV region.39 On the other hand, NiO is a p-type semiconductor with a
wide band gap of 3.4 (eV) having high hole concentration. NiO promotes
the interfacial charge transfer and finds extensive application in
chemical and gas sensing, heterogeneous catalysis, photocatalysis,
and magnetism.40−45 Formation of a heterojunction between n-type and p-type semiconductors
is an effective strategy to avoid charge carrier recombination and
simultaneously improves its photocatalytic and sensing performance.
The heterostructures show enhanced electrical properties for chemical
and gas sensing, photocatalysis, and fuel cell electrodes. In photocatalysis,
fast recombination of electron–hole pairs can be suppressed
and the efficiency of net charge transfer in the reaction system can
be improved by forming heterostructures.46,47 In chemosensing, combining n- and p-type nanostructures leads to
the formation of a more extended depletion layer, thus improving sensitivity
and response time.48

Ag2S, a low band gap semiconductor (1.1 eV), has been
widely used in several fields such as photography, IR detectors, photoconductors,
electrochemical sensing, and photocatalysis because of its excellent
and efficient photooxidative properties.49−52 Moreover, Ag2S has
high absorption coefficient and possesses negligible toxicity compared
to other narrow band gap materials.53,54 Owing to its
remarkable properties such as chemical stability, narrow band gap,
high absorption coefficient, and excellent optical and electronic
properties, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), a ternary nanocomposite,
was made by coupling it with a semiconductor binary metal oxide, which
will facilitate separation of photoinduced charge carriers and show
efficient electronic properties and strong absorption in visible light
because of localized SPR (LSPR) effect.55

In the present study, the facile synthesis of p–n heterojunction
between n-type ZnO and p-type NiO (NZ) by low cost and a simple precipitation
method was reported. The as-prepared binary metal oxide was further
grafted by Ag2S to form Ag2S/NiO–ZnO
(AZN) ternary nanocomposites. The prepared ternary nanocomposite had
some advantages over binary metal oxides as surface plasmon resonance
of Ag, enhancing the visible light absorption and electronic properties
of the ternary nanocomposite. The enhancement in the visible light
photocatalytic efficiency, effective charge separation, and simultaneously
better electronic properties can make the synthesized nanocomposite
a potential photocatalyst and a good chemosensor. The photocatalytic
performance of the fabricated ternary nanocomposite was tested with
the photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) dye in the aqueous phase
under visible light. The electrochemical sensing activity of the prepared
ternary nanocomposite was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV)
against acetone. The probable mechanism of dye degradation and sensing
of acetone were discussed. The fabricated composite is expected to
show high photocatalytic and sensing property. The stability and sensitivity
of the prepared composite were also investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
was used to identify
the characteristic functional groups in the as-prepared nanocomposites.
The samples are dried and mixed with KBr to form pellets, which were
then analyzed by FTIR. The FTIR spectrum of the prepared samples is
displayed in Figure 1. The characteristic broad peaks around 3400–3500 cm–1 depict O–H stretching of the water molecule. The peaks around
400–600 cm–1 arise because of M–O
and O–M–O (M = Ni, Zn, Ag) vibrations.56 The characteristic peak for Ni–O and Zn–O
metal–oxygen vibrations arises at 432 and 490 cm–1, respectively.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of pure NiO, pure ZnO, NZ, and AZN nanocomposites
with different weight ratios of Ag2S.

The peaks in the wavenumber range of 1000–1250 cm–1 are attributed to S–O vibrations and are clearly
seen in
AZN nanocomposites. The peaks around 1186–1224 and 1018–1095
cm–1 correspond to asymmetric valence vibrations
and symmetric valence vibrations of the S–O bond, respectively.57,58 The characteristic band for Ag–S vibration occurs at a wavenumber
(237 cm–1) much lower than M–O vibrations.59,60

2.2 XRD Analysis
The XRD patterns of
pure ZnO, pure NiO, pure Ag2S, NZ, and AZN nanocomposites
with different weight percentages of Ag2S are depicted
in Figure 2. The XRD
peaks of pure NiO with 2θ values of 37.0°, 43.1°,
and 62.7°, corresponding to the crystal planes (111), (200),
and (220), respectively, are in good agreement with the face-centered
cubic structure of NiO (COD 4329325). It is clear from the figure
that no peaks of Ni(OH)2 are observed, suggesting complete
decomposition of Ni(OH)2 into NiO.61

Figure 2 XRD
patterns of pure NiO, pure ZnO, pure Ag2S, NZ, and
AZN nanocomposites with different weight ratios of Ag2S.

The diffraction peaks of ZnO centered
at 2θ values of 31.9°,
34.5°, 36.3°, 47.6°, 56.8°, 62.9, 68.0°,
and 69.1° with the crystal planes (100), (002), (101), (102),
(110), (103), (200), and (112), respectively, are consistent with
the hexagonal structure of ZnO (COD 9011662).

The NZ nanocomposite
exhibits the coexistence of peaks from both
NiO and ZnO. Compared with the NZ nanocomposite, the diffraction peaks
of monoclinic Ag2S are observed in AZN-6 and AZN-8 nanocomposites.
It is clear from the figure that the intensity of diffraction peaks
corresponding to Ag2S is increased with the concentration
increase of AgNO3. Moreover, because of the little amount
of Ag2S used, all peaks due to Ag2S are not
detected and are of low intensity.62 The
crystallite size of the prepared samples was elucidated from the Debye–Scherrer
formula shown in eq 1 1  where k is a constant equal
to 0.9, D is the crystallite size, λ is the
wavelength of X-ray equal to 1.5406 Å, βhkl is the full width at half-maximum, and θ is the Bragg
angle.

As evident from Table 1, the average crystallite size of the AZN catalyst
decreases
with increase in the amount of Ag2S up to 8%, suggesting
high dispersion of Ag2S in the nanocomposite.

Table 1 Average Particle Size of Pure and
Composite Samples
prepared samples	peak

ZnO	36.303	48.8	
NiO	43.326	24.3	
Ag2S	34.406	28.1	
NZ	36.303	31.7

AZN-8	36.303	29.4	
2.3 Optical Properties
The UV-diffuse
reflectance spectra (DRS) curves of ZnO, NiO, NZ, and AZN-8 are presented
in Figure 3. The optical
absorbance shown by ZnO and NiO lies below 400 nm that depicts absorption
in the ultraviolet region. With the formation of a binary metal oxide
(NZ), the absorbance was slightly shifted toward longer wavelength.
However, upon introduction of Ag2S, the composite showed
greater absorption and the absorbance edge was shifted to the visible
region (red shift). This suggests that grafting of Ag2S
on the surface of the binary metal oxide improved the absorption properties
of the AZN nanocomposite and might be the reason for better catalytic
activity of AZN photocatalysts under UV–visible light.

Figure 3 (a) UV-DRS
of NiO, ZnO, NZ, and AZN-8 nanocomposites. (b) Band
gap curve of NZ and AZN-8 nanocomposites.

The optical band gaps of NZ and AZN were determined by eq 2 given by Butler. 2  

On transforming eq 2 to the Kubelka–Munk
function form, the expression becomes 3  where F(R) is the Kubelka–Munk function,
ν is the frequency, Eg is the band
gap energy, and A is the proportionality constant.
The value of n depends upon the
type of transition (n = 1 and n =
2 for direct and indirect transitions, respectively). Herein, we plotted
(F(R) × hν)1/2 versus hν for both NZ and
AZN, and the optical band gaps were calculated to be 3.0 and 2.399
eV, respectively.

2.4 Microscopic Studies
The surface nanostructures
of the prepared samples were studied with the help of scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The typical SEM micrographs
of NZ and AZN nanocomposites at different magnifications are shown
in Figure 4a,b. It
is clear from Figure 4b that the particles of the NZ nanocomposite show uniform size, high
porosity, and perfect hollow nanospheres. The porous nature of the
nanocomposite is highly desirable for better photocatalytic activity.63 After impregnation of Ag2S into the
NZ binary oxide, the morphology of nanocomposites changed and is clearly
depicted in Figure 4c,d. The Ag2S nanoparticles are randomly scattered on
the surface of NZ, providing more surface area and greater reactive
sites and subsequently enhancing its activity. The surface becomes
irregular and the particle size decreases after coupling of Ag2S into the binary metal oxide. This shows concurrence and
nanocomposite formation between NZ and Ag2S.

of the NZ sample at low and high magnification,
(c,d) SEM image of the AZN-8 sample at low and high magnification,
(e) EDS spectrum of NZ, and (f) EDS spectrum of the AZN-8 sample.

The elemental composition of NZ
and AZN nanocomposites was determined
by EDS analysis, and the spectrum is shown in Figure 4e,f. The EDS spectrum of NZ shows the presence
of Ni, Zn, and oxygen (Figure 4e), whereas the EDS spectrum of AZN shows, in addition to
Ni, Zn, and oxygen, that Ag and sulfur are also present (Figure 4f). To further confirm
the dispersion of Ag2S in the host matrix, the EDS elemental
mapping of the AZN-8 nanocomposite was performed. It can be depicted
from Figure 5 that
Ag (Figure 5d) and
S (Figure 5b) are highly
dispersed in the AZN-8 nanocomposite.

[(a) O, (b) S,
(c) Ni, (d) Ag, (e) Zn].

The morphological characterization was further investigated
by
TEM analysis. The TEM images of the NZ nanocomposite (Figure 6a,b) depict the perfect spherical
(NiO) and hexagonal (ZnO) shapes of the particles. Moreover, the shape
of the AZN nanocomposite (Figure 6c,d) shows the irregular distribution of Ag2S nanoparticles on the surface of NZ. The rough surface of NZ decorated
with Ag2S is clearly visible, which dictates the nanocomposite
formation and improves its activity.

nanocomposites.

2.5 Electrochemical
Surface Area Measurement
The surface area of the synthesized
nanocomposites (NZ and AZN)
was calculated by electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC, Cdl).64,65 For the measurement
of the active surface area, CV was performed in the non-faradaic potential
range of 0.1–0.2 V with varying scan rates (10–80 mV
s–1) (Figure 7a). The linear slope of the plot (capacitive currents vs scan
rates) was used to represent the surface area and is equal to twice
the double-layer capacitance (Cdl). The Cdl is supposed to be linearly proportional to
active sites, and the number of active sites often scales to the surface
area of the catalyst. The electrochemical surface areas of NZ and
AZN-8 nanocomposites were found to be 0.000723 and 0.007452 F cm–2, respectively (Figure 7b). The high surface area of AZN-8 nanocomposites,
which is almost 10 times more than that of NZ, is consistent with
experimental inferences. The greater the surface area of the catalyst,
the greater the active sites and the better the catalytic activity
will be.66 Thus, AZN-8 nanocomposites are
expected to show better photocatalytic and electroanalytic activity
because of high electrochemical active surface area.

mV s–1) and (b) capacitive current as a function

3 Applications
3.1 Photodegradation
of Textile Dye
The
photocatalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was assessed for
decolorization and degradation of organic textile dye, RhB, in aqueous
media and in the presence of visible light. Before irradiation, adsorption
test was performed in dark to ensure an adsorption–desorption
phenomenon. For this, the experiment was carried out in dark for 30
min, and it was found that the concentration of the dye remains unchanged,
suggesting insignificant adsorption. The photocatalytic performances
of the NZ and AZN nanocomposites with different Ag2S contents
under visible light radiation are presented in Figure 8. As depicted from Figure 8c, even after 120 min exposure of visible
light without a catalyst, the concentration of the dye remains unaltered,
confirming the significance of the photocatalyst in degrading the
dye molecule. The degradation efficiency of the NZ nanocomposite was
limited because of the poor absorption in the visible region due to
higher band gap. The AZN nanocomposites showed enhanced degradation
of dye molecules in comparison to NZ. The enhanced photocatalytic
performance shown by AZN can be attributed to better absorption in
visible light, large surface area, and the separation of photoinduced
electron–hole pairs. As the photocatalytic reaction is a surface
reaction, the surface properties greatly influence the catalytic efficiency.
Also, ternary nanocomposites having three different junctions possess
more than one pathway for the generation of electron–hole pairs
and their subsequent separation.67

Figure 8 (a) UV–vis

presence of the AZN-8 nanocomposite at different time intervals, (b)

nanocomposites with different Ag2S contents, (c) chemical
kinetics of the photocatalytic decolorization of the dye over various
samples, and (d) bar diagram showing comparative RhB degradation efficiency
over different photocatalysts.

The effect of Ag2S grafting on the NZ nanocomposite
for the degradation of RhB molecules is depicted in Figure 8b. It is clearly evidenced
that Ag2S loading had a pronounced effect on photocatalytic
activity. Initially, with increase of Ag2S content, the
photodegradation activity of the nanocomposite increases, but after
grafting a certain amount, the activity decreases. The decrease in
the activity has been due to agglomeration of nanoparticles and fast
recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The
RhB degradation efficiencies of NZ and AZN nanocomposites with Ag2S percentages of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10% are shown in Figure 8d. Among all photocatalysts,
the optimal photocatalytic activity was shown by AZN-8 with a 95%
degradation efficiency in 120 min. It is evident from Figure 8d that the efficiency of RhB
degradation for the AZN-8 (95%) nanocomposite is about 2.1 times higher
than the NZ (45%) nanocomposite. The degradation of RhB over AZN-8
can be visualized from Figure 8a, which displays the absorption spectral changes of RhB at
554 nm. It can be seen from Figure 8a that the absorption of the dye decreases remarkably
with time, followed by a slight shift of absorption maxima toward
lower wavelength (blue shift), which shows the gradual destruction
and de-ethylation of RhB into its metabolites.62 The absorption spectral changes of RhB over the NZ nanocomposite
can be seen from the Supporting Information (Figure S1). As the concentration of Ag2S is increased,
the RhB degradation efficiency is increased, suggesting the prominent
role of Ag2S in the photocatalytic activity. The enhanced
activity of AZN nanocomposites is due to shift of absorption to longer
wavelength on grafting Ag2S, which increased visible light
absorption. The absorption spectra of RhB over AZN-10 and AZN-6 nanocomposites
are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

To study the kinetics of the reaction, the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
pseudo-first-order model was tested 4  where Kapp is
the pseudo-first-order rate constant, C0 is the initial concentration, and Ct is the concentration of the dye after time “t”. The value of Kapp can be obtained from the first-order linear fit curves (Figure 8c). The apparent
rate constants Kapp (min–1) for various nanocomposite photocatalysts are given in Table 2. It is clear from Table 2 that the rate constant
for the AZN-8 nanocomposite photocatalyst is 0.0302 min–1, which is about 6 times higher than the NZ (0.0051 min–1) nanocomposite. This shows that the AZN-8 nanocomposite shows enhanced
photocatalytic activity, which may be due to efficient charge separation
and strong light absorption.

3.1.1 Mechanism of Photodegradation
To
evaluate the mechanism of photodegradation of the dye, the relative
position of the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB) of
ZnO, NiO, and Ag2S must be known. The approximate energies
of VB of ZnO, NiO, and Ag2S can be investigated by the
formula shown below.62 5  where Eg is the
forbidden gap energy, EC symbolizes the
energy of free electron on hydrogen scale (4.5 eV), and X is the electronegativity of the material expressed in terms of geometric
mean of electronegativity of constituent atoms. The EVB values for ZnO, NiO, and Ag2S were calculated
to be 3.0, 1.95, and 1.1 eV, respectively.68,69 The apparent positions of the CB of ZnO, NiO, and Ag2S were calculated from the equation below 6  

From the equation,
the ECB values of ZnO, NiO, and Ag2S were calculated
to be −0.2, −1.34, and 0 eV, respectively.

The
possible mechanism of the RhB dye degradation over the AZN-8
photocatalyst under visible light irradiation has been given in Figure 9. Upon irradiation
of the photocatalyst, the migration of photogenerated charge carriers
will occur on the interface of NiO and ZnO. Doping of Ag2S to NiO–ZnO nanocomposites reduces the band gaps of both
NiO and ZnO by shifting the Fermi level of both NiO and ZnO to the
visible region. Upon visible light irradiation, the electron from
the VB is excited and drifts over the CB. The CB edge potential of
NiO is high enough to transfer its electron to the CB of ZnO and Ag2S, but the CB edge potential of Ag2S is not enough
to produce superoxide (•O2–) radicals; however, the CB potential of ZnO through the oxidation
produces •O2– radicals
by the reaction with the electrons and the atmospheric oxygen. At
the same instant, the holes h+ generated in the VB of NiO
and ZnO will move from the higher positive value to the lower positive
value and will go to the VB of Ag2S. The holes in the VB
of Ag2S will react with the H2O molecules and
produce hydroxide (•OH) radicals, and the electron
in the CB of ZnO produces •O2– radicals. The incorporation of Ag2S into the matrix thus
helps to minimize the recombination of photoinitiated reactive species
by enhancing the rate of transfer of the electron through the LSPR
effect.55 Therefore, the reactive oxygen
species (ROS) generated during the reaction attacked and degraded
the complex dye molecules into simpler ones. The photodegradation
of the dye molecules under the controlled condition was checked by
monitoring the concentration of the aliquots taken out from the photoreaction
at regular intervals of time.

Figure 9 Schematic diagram for the photocatalytic mechanism
of AZN nanocomposites
under visible light irradiation.

The following reactions were involved in the photodegradation
process 7   8   9   10  

3.1.2 Fluorescence
Emission Spectra
In
order to examine the recombination rate of photoinduced charge carriers,
photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured. PL spectra have a strong
correlation with photocatalytic activity as the spectra originate
due to the recombination of charge carriers in semiconductors.70 The PL intensity is inversely related to photocatalytic
activity, that is, higher PL intensity means faster recombination
of electron–hole pairs and lower photocatalytic activity and
vice versa. The PL spectra of samples at an excitation wavelength
of 640 nm are depicted in Figure 10. It can be seen from the figure that the PL intensity
of ZnO and NiO is higher because of fast recombination rate, whereas
the lower PL intensity was observed for NZ, which is lowered further
on adding different contents of Ag2S, owing to separation
of charge carriers and better photocatalytic activity. The lower PL
intensity is shown by the AZN-8 nanocomposite, which shows better
photocatalytic activity among all prepared photocatalysts.

Figure 10 PL spectra
of different samples at an excitation wavelength of
320 nm.

3.1.3 Role
of Reactive Species
ROS plays
a crucial role in the photodegradation of dye molecules. During the
photooxidation reaction, various reactive species are generated including
a superoxide radical anion (•O2–), a hydroxyl radical (OH•), holes (h+), electrons (e–), and H2O2. The generation of reactive species and subsequently their role
depend upon the light source used.71 To
investigate the dominant reactive species involved in the photodegradation
of RhB, ROS scavenging experiments with different scavengers over
the AZN-8 nanocomposite under visible light were performed. The effect
of different scavengers is determined in terms of decrease of the
first-order rate constant (Kapp) and is
depicted in Figure 11. Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) was added to the reaction system to quench
(OH•) radicals, sodium nitrate was added to quench
electrons, whereas ammonium oxalate (AO) and benzoquinone (BQ) were
added as hole (h+) and superoxide radical anion (•O2–) scavengers, respectively.72

Figure 11 Effect of different scavengers on the degradation of RhB
over the
AZN-8 catalyst.

It is evident from the
figure that addition of scavengers had a
profound effect on the rate of RhB degradation showing a substantial
decrease. The rate of decrease of RhB degradation with AO was slightly
less than IPA, sodium nitrate, and BQ, whereas IPA shows the maximum
decrease in the rate of RhB degradation, followed by BQ and sodium
nitrate. These results suggest that all the four reactive species
are involved in dye degradation, but OH• radicals
are the main reactive species in RhB degradation over the AZN-8 catalyst
under visible light irradiation. The spectral change of RhB over the
AZN-8 nanocomposite in the presence of IPA is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S3).

3.1.4 Recyclability and Stability of the Catalyst
The reusability
and stability of the catalyst are an important
factor to determine the reliability of the catalyst for the potential
application. To evaluate the stability and durability of the AZN-8
catalyst, cyclic experiments were performed. After each cycle, the
photocatalyst was collected by centrifugation and then washed with
deionized (DI) water and ethanol repeatedly. As evidenced from Figure 12, after six recycling
runs, the efficiency of RhB degradation of the catalyst is maintained
at 85%, suggesting only 10% decrease in the efficiency of the catalyst.
The slight decrease in the degradation capability of AZN-8 catalysts
indicates the high stability and recyclable nature of the catalyst.
The decrease in the efficiency of the photocatalyst may be due to
weight loss during the washing of the photocatalyst (Table 3).

3.2 Electrochemical Sensing of Acetone Using Cyclic
Voltammetry
Acetone has vast industrial applications and
is a commonly used solvent in multiple areas. Because it is colorless
and highly volatile, exposure to even parts per million level might
cause serious problems such as headache, allergy, fatigue, and narcosis
in human beings.77 For patients suffering
from diabetes mellitus, sensing of acetone is important to examine
the sugar level.78 According to the breath
diagnosis report, a healthy human should contain 0.8 ppm and a diabetic
patient contains higher than 1.8 ppm of acetone.79 Therefore, a facile and reliable method is needed to quantify
traces of acetone present in a particular environment and also in
human breath. For this purpose, electrochemical sensing of acetone
using surface-coated electrodes [glassy carbon electrode (GCE)] is
a promising method over conventional electrochemical methods in terms
of sensitivity, reproducibility, and stability.80 CV proved to be a reliable technique for studying solvent
sensing ability of nanomaterials. In the method of quantification,
the target analyte is either oxidized or reduced upon application
of certain potential, which can be monitored by the corresponding
change in current.72

The electrocatalytic
properties of the NZ and AZN-8 nanocomposites toward acetone detection
were examined in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer at room
temperature using CV. The assembly of the working electrode (GCE)
and the plausible mechanism of acetone detection are demonstrated
pictorially in Scheme 1.

Sensing over Pasted GCE
The comparative analysis of electrochemical activity of
bare GCE
electrode and modified electrode with NZ (NZ/GCE/binder) and AZN-8
(AZN-8/GCE/binder) toward detection of acetone was carried out. Figure 13 represents the
cyclic voltammograms of differently modified electrodes toward 0.2
M acetone in 0.1 M PBS at a scan rate of 30 mV s–1. Figure 13a depicts
the response of bare GCE electrode with and without acetone. As seen
in Figure 13a, bare
GCE electrode shows negligible response toward acetone, and no redox
peaks were observed. In the case of NZ/GCE (Figure 13b), the modified electrode shows limited
response toward acetone, which can be attributed to poor electrocatalytic
property and slow electrode kinetics. In contrast, the AZN-8-modified
electrode shows better response with acetone (Figure 13c), and a pair of distinctive redox peaks
appears upon addition of acetone. The appearance of characteristic
anodic and cathodic peaks may be ascribed to the synergistic effect
of the NZ nanocomposite and the grafted Ag2S nanoparticles,
which generates more catalytic sites and increases electron transfer.

in 0.1 M PBS buffer in the absence and presence of 0.2 M acetone at
a scan rate of 30 mV s–1.

The variation of redox current with acetone in the concentration
range of 10 mmol L–1 to 0.5 mol L–1 for the AZN-8 nanocomposite is shown in Figure 14a. With successive addition of acetone in
the buffer system, characteristic anodic peaks with amplified current
at around 0.2 V potential are observed. At a fixed potential, the
variation of anodic peak current with the concentration of acetone
was found to be linear. The analytical characteristics of the AZN-8
nanocomposite were calculated from a linear calibration curve (Figure 14b). From the curve,
regression coefficient (r2 = 0.9848),
sensitivity (4.0764 μA mmol L–1 cm–2), and limit of detection (LOD: 0.06 mmol L–1)
were calculated at the S/N ratio of 3.

with different acetone concentrations and
(b) calibration curve depicting the relationship between the acetone
concentration and oxidation peak current values.

The influence of scan rates on the redox peak currents of
the AZN-8
nanocomposite has been examined in the range of 5–100 mV s–1. It has been observed that both the cathodic peak
current and anodic peak current vary linearly with scan rates (Figure 15). The proportional
rise in redox peak currents with the scan rate suggests that the electrode
reaction is a surface-controlled electrochemical reaction.81 Moreover, the optimization of pH was done in
several buffer systems (pH = 4.5–8.5), and it was found that
the fabricated sensor was more active at pH 7.5.

Figure 15 CVs of AZN-8/GCE in
0.2 M PBS buffer at scan rates of 5–100
mV s–1 (from inner to outer); the inset shows the
plots of redox peak currents vs scan rate.

In the electrochemical sensing experiment, the current grows
gradually
with the enrichment of buffer solution with the target analyte (acetone).
Initially, the surface of the modified electrode (AZN-8/GCE/binder)
was slightly occupied, and the oxidation reaction of acetone was limited.
As the concentration of acetone is successively increased in the buffer
system, the surface coverage of the electrode increases, and hence,
the oxidation reaction is enhanced. During the oxidation of acetone,
the electrons are released into the buffer system, which accounts
for enhancement of the current. The plausible mechanism suggests that
O2 and acetone are adsorbed onto the coated electrode surface,
resulting in the release of electrons, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide
as depicted in reactions 11 and 12.79 11   12  

The proposed mechanism clearly shows
that oxidation of acetone
produces electrons; hence, the acetone detection mechanism of the
fabricated AZN-8/GCE/binder sensors is simple. Moreover, the proposed
acetone sensor is easy to fabricate, inert in chemical systems, economical,
and stable in air. Thus, the cost-effective synthesis combined with
excellent photocatalytic and sensing performance is a promising strategy
to remediate environment under optimum conditions (Table 4).

3.3 Practical Implications of Study
Photocatalytic
oxidation of organic pollutants and simultaneous oxidation of VOCs
and volatile inorganic compounds in both gas phase and solvent phase
have received considerable attention from the scientific society.
Photocatalysis has the signature of promising technology, which has
explored almost every field of study and has tremendous applications
in environmental systems. Numerous applications of photocatalysis
have achieved commercial maturity but have not yet penetrated mass
markets. Industrial applications have impacted the construction sector,
aerospace industries, automotive, medical sector, and food industry.
Although photocatalysis is at the forefront of research, it is yet
to attain commercialization; only a few small-scale or large-scale
photocatalytic industries have been set up. However, these applications
validate the utilization of photocatalysis as a beneficial technology
for the environment, human health, and social structure.

The
major challenge which should be dealt with is the commercialization
of photocatalytic technology; it should be utilized in commercial
applications. The second challenge deals with the efforts and techniques,
which should be adopted to fabricate a potential photocatalyst that
can be efficient, pragmatic, and useful. The third and the more realistic
challenge is to increase the quantum efficiency of photocatalytic
systems.

In addition to this, chemical sensing by nanostructures
is an eco-friendly
and cost-effective approach to detect and quantify the hazardous volatile
chemicals from the environment. This approach has gained more compatibility
as compared to enzymatic sensors because of reliability and economic
approach. Lower detection limit and higher sensitivity are highly
desirable for proper functioning of chemical sensors.

The future
prospects envisage the utilization and optimization
of photocatalysis for bringing sustainability in environmental processes
and biocompatibility. The fabrication of capable nanocomposites with
excellent photocatalytic activity and remarkable electronic and biological
properties can be beneficial for humankind.

4 Conclusions
In summary, ternary AZN nanocomposites with
different weight ratios
of Ag2S were successfully synthesized by a simple homogeneous
precipitation method. The detailed morphological characterizations
demonstrate the porous nature and high surface area of the nanocomposite.
In contrast to NZ, the AZN nanocomposite showed enhanced photocatalytic
performance, indicating strong visible light-harvesting and efficient
charge separation characteristics. Among all nanocomposites formed,
AZN-8 exhibits optimal photocatalytic activity with the RhB degradation
efficiency of 95% in 120 min under visible light irradiation. The
prominent species involved in photodegradation was found to be hydroxyl
and superoxide radicals. Recycling experiments proved the stability
and reliability of the nanocomposite. Moreover, the electrochemical
and electroanalytical results revealed that the prepared nanocomposite
exhibits remarkable activity toward detection of acetone. The fabricated
nanocomposite sensor showed excellent activity in terms of high sensitivity
and lower detection limit. The notable enhancement in photocatalytic
and sensing activity can be ascribed to the impregnation of Ag2S into the NZ nanostructure, which due to the LSPR effect
enhances the visible light absorption, suppresses the charge carrier
recombination, and increases the electronic properties.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Chemicals and Materials
All chemicals
were of analytical grade and used without further purification. The
chemicals used are as follows: zinc nitrate [Zn(NO3)2]·6H2O, nickel nitrate [Ni(NO3)2·6H2O], sodium hydroxide (NaOH), silver nitrate
[Ag(NO3)2], sodium sulfide (Na2S·6H2O), RhB, acetone, methanol, glucose, terephthalic acid, AO,
BQ, IPA, acetic acid, and chitosan. All chemicals were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (India). DI water was used throughout the experimental
study.

5.2 Synthesis of NiO, ZnO, and NiO–ZnO
(NZ) Nanocomposites
NiO, ZnO, and NiO–ZnO nanocomposites
were synthesized by a homogeneous precipitation method.61 In a typical procedure for preparing ZnO nanoparticles,
0.05 M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was magnetically
stirred in 250 mL of distilled water for 25 min at 70 °C on a
hot plate. A white precipitate appears on adding 40 mL of 2.0 M NaOH
into the above solution dropwise under continuous stirring. The mixture
was further stirred for 40 min at 80 °C and then cooled to room
temperature, and the precipitate was harvested through filtration.

NiO nanoparticles were prepared from Ni(NO3)2·6H2O by the same procedure as followed above, but
here, greenish precipitate appears on adding NaOH solution.

For synthesizing NiO–ZnO binary oxide, equal quantities
of nickel and zinc precursor (1:1 mole ratio) were dissolved in 250
mL of water. The resulting solution was ultrasonicated for 30 min.
A similar procedure was followed thereafter to prepare NiO–ZnO
(NZ) binary oxide nanocomposites. All prepared samples were calcined
at 500 °C for 3 h.

5.3 Synthesis of Ag2S/NiO–ZnO
Ternary Nanocomposites
The grafting of Ag2S on
the surface of NiO–ZnO binary oxide was carried out by in situ
growth of Ag2S on the surface of binary metal oxide nanocomposites
at room temperature. For that, 1 g of NiO–ZnO mixed oxide nanoparticles
and different weight percentages of AgNO3 were dispersed
in 60 mL of ethanol and ultrasonicated for 40 min. After ultrasonication,
the calculated amount of Na2S was added to the suspension
while stirring. The resulting suspension was stirred continuously
for 8 h. The precipitate thus obtained was collected with filtration,
washed repeatedly with distilled water and absolute ethanol, and then
dried at 80 °C for 10 h. Different weight ratios of Ag2S to NiO–ZnO were synthesized and labeled as 2% Ag2S/NiO–ZnO (AZN-2), 4% Ag2S/NiO–ZnO (AZN-4),
6% Ag2S/NiO–ZnO (AZN-6), 8% Ag2S/NiO–ZnO
(AZN-8), and 10% Ag2S/NiO–ZnO (AZN-10).

5.4 Characterization
The characterization
of the prepared samples was done with several analytical techniques.
The functional group analysis was performed with a Fourier transform
infrared spectrometer (PerkinElmer) in the range 400–4000 cm–1. The crystallinity and phase identification of the
samples were analyzed by a powder X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu 6100)
with Cu Kα radiation (1.5418 Å) in the scan range 20°–80°
(2θ). Band gap analysis of samples was done by UV–vis
DRS spectra using a UV–vis NIR spectrometer (PerkinElmer).
Morphological characterizations and elemental composition were done
with SEM (JEOL, JSM6510LV) fitted with an energy-dispersive X-ray
detector and TEM (JEOL, JEM 2100). The electrochemical surface areas
of the catalysts were investigated by EDLC (Cdl). PL spectra were recorded by a Shimadzu fluorospectrometer
at 640 nm excitation wavelength.

5.5 Photocatalytic
Test Procedure
Photocatalytic
performance of as-prepared nanocomposites was checked in a quartz
photoreactor against aqueous solution of organic dyes (RhB). The assembly
of the photoreactor consists of an inner and outer chamber with a
water circulating jacket for maintaining temperature and an opening
for bubbling molecular oxygen. The inner jacket consists of a halogen
lamp (500 W, 9500 lumens) used for irradiation. The decolorization/photodegradation
of the organic dye was assessed in the outer chamber. The catalyst
dosage was optimized by taking different amounts of the prepared catalyst.
Before irradiation, appropriate amount of dye solution (1 mM) with
1 mg mL–1 catalyst dosage was magnetically stirred
for 30 min to attain adsorption–desorption equilibrium. After
irradiation, dye aliquots were taken at 5 min intervals, centrifuged,
and analyzed in a UV–vis spectrophotometer to measure the maximum
absorbance at 554 nm. The degradation potentiality was deduced by
using eq 13 13  where C0 is the
starting concentration of the dye and Ct is the concentration of the dye at a particular
time.

The effect of reactive species was also assessed by adding
calculated quantity of scavengers in the reaction system to elucidate
the possible mechanism of photodegradation. The photostability of
the catalyst was also evaluated by performing recycling experiment.

5.6 Sensor Fabrication and Sensing Activity
Electrochemical and electroanalytical measurements of samples were
done with CV (Autolab, PGSTAT204). A three-electrode assembly was
employed for electroanalytical measurements comprising an Ag/AgCl
electrode as the reference electrode, modified GCE as the working
electrode, and platinum wire as the counter electrode. The pictorial
representation of a three-electrode assembly is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S4). The prepared
ternary nanocomposite (Ag2S/NiO–ZnO) was pasted
on the surface of GCE (0.5 mm diameter) using a conventional conducting
binder. The electrolytic solution used was 0.1 M PBS within the pH
range of 7.0–7.5, and the experiment was carried out at room
temperature (25 °C).

Sensing performance of the fabricated
sensor (Ag2S/NiO–ZnO/GCE/binder) was evaluated with
acetone. The concentration of acetone was varied from 10 mmol L–1 to 0.5 mol L–1, and the corresponding I–V plots were drawn. A calibration
plot was drawn between current and concentration, whose slope was
used for the evaluation of sensitivity and detection limit of sensing
films.

The conventional binder was prepared by taking 1 mL of
IPA and
DI water and 2.6 mg of nanocomposites. The prepared suspension was
converted into a binder by adding appropriate quantities of chitosan
and glacial acetic acid.
