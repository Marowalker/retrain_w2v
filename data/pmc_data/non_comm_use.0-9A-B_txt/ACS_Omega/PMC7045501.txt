2,3-Benzodiazepine compounds are an important family of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid receptor (AMPAR) antagonists that act in a noncompetitive manner.
Due to the critical role of AMPARs in the synapse and various neurological
diseases, significant scientific interest in elucidating the molecular
basis of the function of the receptors has spiked. The analogues were
synthesized to assess the functional consequence of removing the amine
group of the phenyl ring, the potency and efficacy of inhibition by
substituting a halogen group at the meta vs ortho position of the
phenyl ring, and layout the prediction of potential drug candidates
for AMPAR hyperactivation. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique,
we assessed the effect of the derivative on the amplitude of various
AMPA-type glutamate receptors and calculated the desensitization and
deactivation rates before and after treatment of HEK293 cells. We
noticed that the amino group is not necessary for inhibition as long
as an electron-withdrawing group is placed on the meta position of
the phenyl ring of BDZ. Furthermore,
compound 4a significantly inhibited and affected the desensitization
rate of the tested AMPARs but showed no effect on the deactivation
rate. The current study paves the way to a better understanding of
AMPARs and provides possible drug candidates of 2,3-BDZ different
from the conventional derivatives.

Introduction
2,3-Benzodiazepine (2,3-BDZ) derivatives, also known as GYKI, are
a group of synthetic drug candidates that noncompetitively inhibit
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors
(AMPARs). In various acute neurological disorders such as cerebral
ischemia and epilepsy as well as in chronic neurodegenerative pathologies
such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
Huntington’s chorea, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
excessive stimulation of AMPARs has been implicated.1−3 Consequently, chemotherapeutic applications provided strong motivation
for the synthesis of 2,3-BDZ analogues due to their anticonvulsant
and neuroprotective properties. Moreover, they have demonstrated higher
potency and selectivity toward AMPA receptors than other compounds
in animal and in vitro studies.4 The prototypic
compound of the 2,3-BDZ family, 7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine
(GYKI 52466; Figure 1) was first introduced in the 1980s and has been used as a template
and standard in the synthesis and activity evaluations of new GYKI
compounds.1 While the 2,3-BDZs’
structures (Figure 1) have different pharmacological activity besides their effect on
the central nervous system, they also possess anti-inflammatory,5 antimicrobial,6 vasopressin
antagonist,7 endothelia antagonist,8 cholecystokinin antagonist,9 antithrombotic,10 anti-HIV,11 and antiproliferative activities.12 Hence, there is a keen interest in 2,3-BDZ for
applications in numerous fields besides neurology.

Figure 1 2,3-BDZ prototype and GYKI 52466 structure.

The crystal structure of AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors
shows that antiepileptic drugs bind to an allosteric site, located
in the ion channel’s extracellular part. Noncompetitive inhibitors
prevent channel openings by triggering an interaction network that
results in a conformational change on the channel gate.13,14 Acting in a noncompetitive manner, 2,3-BDZ depresses the maximum
of the sigmoid concentration–response curve. In other words,
AMPA receptors cannot be maximally activated regardless of agonist
concentration, hence preventing glutamate-induced neuronal death.
On the contrary, at high agonist concentrations, the protective effect
of competitive AMPA antagonists was absent.3,14 Moreover,
a competitive AMPAR antagonist, 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo
(F) quinoxaline (NBQX), and its analogues have been shown to increase
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission in the cerebellum by non-AMPA-dependent
mechanisms, as well as depolarize hippocampally and act at the KA
(kainate) receptors, suggesting a loss of selectivity.4 These findings pivoted research toward noncompetitive antagonists
for AMPARs, such as 2,3-BDZ derivatives. Previous work has identified
three noncompetitive sites on the GluA2Qflip from different
2,3-BDZ analogues: (i) the “M” site, i.e., the methyl
group in position 4 of the heptatonic ring is substituted with the
methylenedioxy moiety in positions 7 and 8 of the aromatic ring, and
numerous structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies on this
show a chiral stereoselectivity of the R configuration
for the methyl group.1,15 Moreover, it has been demonstrated
that upon N-3 acylation the biological activity of the compound increases,
and like the “E” site, a greater preferential in the
closed channel state is observed. (ii) The E site, where the methylenedioxy
is substituted with an ethylenedioxy group at the 7 and 8 positions
of the aromatic ring and, unlike the M site, is not chiral or as potent.
Finally, (iii) the “O” site, where the C-4 methyl group
is replaced by a carbonyl moiety, prefers the open-channel state,
and its N-3 acylation decreases the potency as shown by the Niu et
al. group.2,16

The fundamental principle behind structure–activity relationships
(SARs) is that molecular activity is a function of structure; as a
result, molecules of similar structures have similar functions.4,17 By constructing a set of similar chemical structures, via a single
molecule substitution, a mechanistic characterization can be deduced
from the mode of action caused by these refinements.4 Providing more information from SAR studies enables a better
understanding of and predictability for designing efficacious regulatory
agents, such as inhibitors and can optimize their pharmacological
profile through a higher potency and selectivity toward a specific
protein or receptor.13 For this reason,
we investigate the functional consequences of adding an electron-withdrawing
group (i.e., chlorine atom) at the C-3 position vs C-2 position of
the 2,3-benzodiazepine phenyl ring.

Previously reported SAR studies, specifically on the M site, demonstrated
the importance of the 4-aminophenyl group for the antiepileptic effect
of this class of compounds.18 Moreover,
a lack of the amino group in the para position or its acetylation
can tremendously decrease potency. However, the biological activity
was increased upon a methyl addition at the ortho to the amino group
position, which shared similar results to the addition of chlorine
instead of a methyl group.1,19 These results suggested
that the aminophenyl ring is a potential function moiety to be modified
to improve potency. However, how the elimination of the amino group
of the phenyl ring affects the O site potency has never been determined.
Unlike the M or E site, the potency of the O site is reduced by the
addition of alkyl or aryl-alkyl group on N-3 as it does not account
for the steric hindrance in its side pocket. Thus, we hypothesize
that by removing the amino group of the phenyl ring we can further
enhance its potency by accommodating its small pocket in comparison
to the E or M site.16

The current study synthesized two 2,3-BDZ analogues, (i) 5-(3-chlorophenyl)-7,9-dihydro-8H[1,3]dioxolo[4,5:4,5]benzo[1,2-d][1,2]diazepin-8-one, (ii) 5-(2-chlorophenyl)-7,9-dihydro-8H-[1,3]dioxolo[4′,5′:4,5]benzo[1,2-d][1,2]diazepin-8-one, as shown in Figure 1, on the assumption that (a) both compounds
bind to the O site, (b) inhibition remains despite the amino group
removal from the para position of the phenyl group, and (c) the chemical
composition does not change when binding to different AMPAR subunits.
The mechanisms of action of compounds were characterized to answer
the following questions: what is the functional consequence of adding
an electron-withdrawing group (i.e., chlorine atom) at C-3 position
vs C-2 position of the aminophenyl ring? Which is better in terms
of potency and efficacy? Would a methyl group have the same effect
as a halogen? What is the significant role of the amino group in the
phenyl ring? Consequently, we can provide a quantitative understanding
of the functional consequences of these structural changes, based
on the original structure of GYKI 52466.

Results and Discussion
Identification of Receptor–Antagonist Interactions Using
Molecular Modeling
Amino acid sequences and three-dimensional
(3D) orientations of the allosteric binding sites are conserved between
human and rat AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors of both
GluA1 and GluA2. The crystal structure of GluA2 (PDB code 5L1G(26)) was found with a 2,3-benzodiazepine containing a molecule,
for the given reason: the docking studies were conducted on the GluA2
crystal structure to analyze the interaction network within the active
site. Our molecular modeling studies showed that compounds 4a and 4b share a similar interaction network to the crystal
ligand, a brominated analogue of a GYKI series inhibitor, GYKI-Br,
which has been previously reported to interact at the O site.

4-Amino group of 3-bromophen-1-yl part of GYKI-Br makes a hydrogen
bond with SER615, phenyl group of the same part makes van der Waals
interactions with LEU620 and ASN791, and H atoms of the same aromatic
ring make a weak hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of SER516.
The carboxamide group forms a hydrogen bond with ASN791. Finally,
the dioxolobenzodiazepine ring forms π–π interaction
with PHE623 amino acid. The predicted interactions of 4a showed higher similarity to the binding mode of GYKI-Br present
in the crystal structure. This is related to the steric suitability
of the binding pocket for the halogen atoms at the meta position of
the phenyl ring.

Similarly, the dioxolobenzodiazepin ring of 4a forms
a hydrogen bond with ASN791 and π–π interaction
with PHE623, the 3-chlorobenzene ring of the same molecule forms van
der Waals interactions with PRO520, LEU620, and ASN791, and H atoms
of the same ring make a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of SER516.
The predicted binding orientation of 4b shows a hydrogen
bond with the 2,3-benzodiazepine core of the molecule and ASN791 amino
acid. Additionally, a 2-chlorophenyl derivative makes van der Waals
interactions with ASP519, LEU620, LEU624, LEU787, and ASN791 and the
H atoms of the 2-chlorophenyl group make a weak hydrogen bond with
SER516. The main reason for decreasing potency is thought to be related
to the missing π–π interaction with PHE623 amino
acid (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Binding mode analysis of GYKI-Br obtained from crystal
structures and docking results of AMPA-subtype ionotropic receptor
antagonists 4a and 4b against GluA2 visualized
with the main interacting residues of the allosteric binding site
and summarized with a legend of protein–ligand interactions.
There is a commonly shared interaction pattern with GYKI-Br, 4a, and 4b against the GluA2 receptor,
including hydrogen bonds, π–π interactions, and
hydrophobic interactions. The π–π interaction is
lost between the PHE623 residue and 4b, which might be
the reason for losing the activity against both GluA1 and GluA2. Additionally,
keeping the hydrogen bond with SER615 might support the activity for
both 4a and 4b.

Level of Inhibition from 4a vs 4b 2,3-BDZ Derivatives
on Various AMPA-Type Receptors
Confirming the interaction
of these compounds at the O site, we needed to analyze their activity
for SAR comparisons and predictions. Thus, it was essential to quantify
the inhibitory activity of these compounds and evaluate their possible
drug potential for glutamate toxicity. Using whole-cell recordings
of AMPAR-transfected HEK293 cells, we compared the current induced
from glutamate alone (A) vs glutamate plus antagonist
amplitude (AI) and ran a one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) test to identify the significant inhibition resulted
by these two compounds, as shown in Figure 3. Previously reported, O site docking structures
favor an open-state channel; to ensure such a state, we used 10 mM
ligand concentration, at which 95% corresponds to the open-channel
form.

current recording was conducted at −60 mV, pH 7.4, and 22 °C.
Graphs summarize weighted time constants for activation. Data shown
are mean ± SEM; n = 6 (number of patch cells
in the whole-cell configuration). Significance (one-way ANOVA): *p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; ns, not significant.

The above-described data elaborates on the difference in activity
between the derivatives in terms of current induction. Before any
antagonist treatment, the cells were supplied with 500 ms intervals
of 10 mM glutamate to average the obtained amplitudes of GluA1, GluA2,
GluA1/2, and GluA2/3 that were recorded at 967 ± 32, 1290 ±
62, 480 ± 31, and 395 ± 39 pA, respectively. However, upon
treating the cells with the meta position 2,3-BDZ derivatives (4a), the recordings drastically drop to 144 ± 21, 208
± 28, 87 ± 15, and 67 ± 24 pA, following the order
of glutamate-induced recordings. The ratio, representing the significant
inhibition A/AI of the
derivative on GluA1, GluA2, GluA1/2, and GluA2/3, is the following:
6.7 ± 0.1, 6.2 ± 0.1, 5.5 ± 0.2, and 5.9 ± 0.3,
respectively. Surprisingly, similar amplitudes were conducted between
the glutamate-induced and ortho-induced treatment of the cells. Thus,
the glutamate recordings were 715 ± 27, 847 ± 35, 481 ±
22, and 348 ± 26 pA, and comparatively, the current after the
derivative treatment remained at 715 ± 27, 847 ± 35, 481
± 22, and 348 ± 26 pA for GluA1, GluA2, GluA1/2, and GluA2/3,
respectively.

Concentration-Dependent Inhibition of the Derivatives on AMPA-Type
Receptors
The levels of inhibition of 4a in
comparison to 4b intrigued our interest to determine
the potency of the drug in a concentration-dependent manner. Recording
inhibition of different antagonist concentrations showcased the maximized
potency as well as the plateau (14 μM), as seen in Figure 4. As previously demonstrated, 4b had no effect on inhibition, which is also evident here
as the increase of concentration of the compound is indifferent to
AMPAR activity. On the contrary, 4a drastically inhibits
AMPARs even at a low concentration and maintains to inhibit as the
concentration increases until it reached a plateau (14–18 μM).
As a result, the antagonist concentration was fixed at 14 μM
due to maximizing the level of inhibition concentration for all AMPARs.
The concentration–inhibition curves were constructed by applying
glutamate alone (A) at a concentration of 10 mM,
followed by glutamate plus 2,3-BDZ derivatives (AI) at different concentrations (μM) for every recording
point. Afterward, the cells were normalized back by applying glutamate
alone. Each point used the 500 ms protocol followed by the 10 ms wash
solution, and the resulting currents were normalized to the steady-state
current obtained with agonist alone. Hence, the first point was recorded
without any antagonist concentration, whereby the concentration increment
for the recordings was 2 μM until a plateau was reached, as
shown in Figure 4.
Importantly, the cell was subjected to a new concentration after several
washout intervals to ensure cell recovery. Finally, we determined
the IC50 value on GluA1 for both compounds to ensure that
the effectiveness of 4a is significant. From the dose–response
curve of 4a, the IC50 on GluA1 was determined
at 2.203 μM, as shown in Figure S3. As for 4b, the IC50 on GluA1 was determined
at 8.476 μM (Figure S4), which is
extremely higher than 4a and presents no potency potential.
GYKI analogues are highly selective toward AMPARs. Here, we report
a higher effect and potency toward homomeric forms of AMPARs than
heteromeric types; nonetheless, the potency of 4a remains
significant on all tested AMPARs.

Figure 4 Concentration-dependent inhibition of the derivatives on AMPA-type
receptors. To measure the inhibition of 4a (A) and 4b (B) on AMPARs, the cell was supplied with Glu (alone),
then Glu plus 2,3-BDZ derivatives in μM concentration, and finally
Glu alone using the 500 ms to ensure the healthiness of the cell.
Between every concentration point, the cell was subjected to a wash
solution for 10 ms to recover fully. After several washout intervals,
the rest of the recording points were obtained using the same procedure
with an increment of 2 μM between each concentration point.
Data points (n = 6 cells) were normalized to the
response of different 4a and 4b concentrations.

Effect of 4a and 4b 2,3-BDZ Derivatives
on AMPAR Desensitization and Deactivation
The importance
of the biophysical gating properties of AMPARs is needed to be assessed
to confirm the functional consequence of substituting the halogen
group of the phenyl ring at different positions. AMPAR-current deactivation
and desensitization were fitted with two exponentials, and the weighted
tau (τw) was calculated as τw =
(τf × af) + (τs × as), where af and as are the relative
amplitudes of the fast (τf) and slow (τs) exponential components. While 4b did not affect
desensitization or deactivation rates, similar to its inhibiting activity, 4a seemed only to affect desensitization, as shown in Figure 5. The desensitization
values before 4a application for GluA1, GluA2, GuA1/2,
and GluA2/3 were 2.6 ± 0.1, 2.8 ± 0.1, 4.9 ± 0.1, and
2.5 ± 0.1 ms, respectively. After treatment with 4a, the desensitization values increased to 4.2 ± 0.2, 4.6 ±
0.2, 6.3 ± 0.2, and 3.8 ± 0.2 ms, following the previously
mentioned order, which account for 0.24, 0.22, 0.16, and 0.26, respectively,
when converted to the rate of desensitization. The most dramatic drop
in rate was toward GluA1/2, which was unlike the inhibiting effect
that had the highest potency on the GluA1 homomer. On the contrary,
no effect on deactivation was observed by 4a, at a speed
of 20 ms application of control vs 4a, the deactivation
changed from 2.1 ± 0.1 to 2.3 ± 0.2 ms for GluA1 AMPAR-subtype,
from 2.3 ± 0.1 to 2.5 ± 0.1 ms for GluA2 homomer, from 2.6
± 0.2 to 2.5 ± 0.2 ms for GluA1/2, and from 2.7 ± 0.2
to 2.6 ± 0.2 ms GluA2/3 AMPAR heteromeric subunits, as shown
in Figure 6. Insignificantly, 4b did not affect desensitization or deactivation; the whole-cell
recording from this compound is provided in the Supporting Information.

Conclusions
AMPA receptors are indispensable to the brain due to their critical
role in learning and memory formation. However, excessive activation
or overexpression of AMPARs has been linked to neurotoxicity and associated
with numerous neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, Alzheimer’s
disease, Parkinson’s disease, and epilepsy. This study has
shown a structure-based activity relationship with novel 2,3-BDZ derivatives
against various AMPA-type receptors. Predicted binding modes of the
antagonists show slight changes in the interactions, which might be
responsible for the differences in the observed selectivity against
AMPA-subtype ionotropic receptors. Our electrophysiological investigations
showed that the mechanism of inhibition of the meta chlorine position
has higher biological activity than that of the ortho, which can be,
in part, due to the reduced steric hindrance. In addition, we can
conclude that the amino group of the phenyl ring is not necessary
for inhibition; instead, an electron-withdrawing group can replace
it. Moreover, both compounds seem to quite favorably inhibit the GluA2
homotetrameric AMPA receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. Surprisingly,
the deactivation was not affected, while the desensitization rate
was reduced from the 4a compound. Furthermore, the inhibition
of the compound occurred in a noncompetitive manner, as the increase
in glutamate concentration showed no correlation with the level of
inhibition. Finally, in this study, we optimized the pharmacological
profile of 2,3-BDZ by increasing its potency and selectivity and provided
a better understanding of the AMPAR function and mechanism of inhibition.
As part of our ongoing investigation, we aim to examine these compounds
in vivo, i.e., AMPA toxicity in rat embryonic telencephalon cell culture.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
All of the reagents used were
purchased from reliable resources: the following reagents were used
in the research project: 3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenyl acetic acid, acetic
acid, oxalyl chloride, sodium bicarbonate, ortho-chlorobenzoic
acid, meta-chlorobenzoic acid, phosphorus pentoxide,
magnesium sulfate, hydrazine hydrate, methanol, ethanol, n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and dichloromethane (DCM). Melting points
were determined with an SMP-II digital melting point apparatus and
were uncorrected. Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer
Spectrum 400 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)/Fourier transform near-infrared
(FTNIR) spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) and performed using
a Bruker Avance III 500 MHz FT-NMR high-performance digital spectrometer,
and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or
DMSO-d6 using a Bruker Avance III 400
MHz FT-NMR high-performance digital spectrometer, at the Faculty of
Science, Department of Chemistry, The University of Jordan, Jordan.
Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal standard. All chemical shifts
were recorded as d (ppm). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) data
were collected using a Shimadzu LCMS-IT-TOF by an electrospray ionization
(ESI) (+) method, at the Doping and Narcotics Analysis Laboratory,
Faculty of Pharmacy, Anadolu University, Turkey. Compounds were purified
by chromatography and checked for purity using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) before they were tested in biological assays
(purity was 98–99%, as shown in Figures S1 and S2).

Synthesis of 2,3-BDZ Derivatives
Benzodiazepine Derivatives 4a and 4b
Benzodiazepine derivatives were synthesized in three steps,
as outlined in Scheme 1. To collect high yield of ester (as shown in step 2), two methods
were used: the first one by employing hydrochloric acid in methanol
for 30 min, and20 the second method, which
gave higher yield, used thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride that had
been added dropwise to methanol solvent and stirred for 30 min in
an ice bath.21 The IR spectra of ester
(step 2) showed the disappearance of the broad peak that belonged
to the acetic acid group of step 1. Ketoesters 3a and 3b were synthesized by dissolving the ester (step 2) in dichloromethane
with benzoic acid derivatives in the presence of an excess of phosphorus
pentoxide, followed by stirring at room temperature for approximately
16 h. The subsequent treatment of methyl 2-[6-(3-chlorobenzoyl)-2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl]acetate (3a) and methyl 2-[6-(2-chlorobenzoyl)-2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl]acetate (3b) with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol with acetic acid afforded
benzodiazepine derivatives 4a and 4b, respectively.20,22−25

Synthesis of Methyl 2-(2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)acetate
Dissolved the 3,4-(methylenedioxy)-phenyl acetic acid (1) (2 g, 11.10
mmol) in methanol, then cooled in an ice bath at 0 °C, and added
oxalyl chloride (1 mL, 11.70 mmol) dropwise, and stirred the reaction
mixture for 30 min. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness,
then diluted with ethyl acetate, and then washed with saturated sodium
bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and distilled water, respectively.
The organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate drying agent, filtered,
evaporated again to concentrate it, and then purified by silica gel
column chromatography using the n-hexane/ethyl acetate
solvent system (50:50) to afford a yellow oily compound (step 2) in
95% yield.

General Procedure for Ketoester (3a and 3b) Synthesis
To a stirred solution of dichloromethane (50
mL) and methyl 2-(2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)acetate compound (step 2)
(500 mg, 2.57 mmol), ortho- or meta-chlorobenzoic acid (523 mg, 3.34
mmol) and phosphorus pentoxide (3 g) were added (Scheme 1). Afterward, the mixture was
further stirred at room temperature for 16–20 h, then distilled
water (50 mL) was cautiously added, and the mixture extracted with
ethyl acetate (2 × 50 mL). The organic layer was separated and
then treated with 1M NaOH (50 mL), saturated sodium chloride (50 mL),
and distilled water (2 × 50 mL). The organic layer was dried
with a drying agent magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated under
reduced pressure, and then purified by silica gel column chromatography.

Molecular Docking Studies
The molecules bind to an
allosteric binding site, which is conserved between human and rat
AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors GluA1 and GluA2. The crystal
structure of AMPA GluA2 was complexed with a similar heterocyclic
ring containing a noncompetitive inhibitor molecule GYKI-Br. Potential
protein–ligand interactions of the molecules were revealed
by conducting docking studies with the crystal structure (PDB code 5L1G,26 resolution 4.5 Å) using Glide 8.4.27 The ligands were drawn using Maestro 12.1 graphical user
interface28 and prepared by LigPrep29 (pH 7.0 ± 2.0) to assign the atom types
and the protonation states with OPLS3e force field. The same force
field was used for proteins, and predicted positions of the missing
side chains were added with the Protein Preparation Wizard.30 The grids were generated, and docking simulations
were done in single-precision mode (GlideScore SP). The docking results
of 2,3- benzodiazepine derivatives were visualized at GluA1 and GluA2
active sites, the resulting binding modes were evaluated with PLIP
1.4.4,30 and the resulting poses were visualized
with PyMOL 2.3.31

Whole-Cell Recordings
DNA preparation, cDNA transient
transfection, and cell culturing of human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293)
expressing the flip isoform of AMPAR subunits have been previously
described.32−35 Electrophysiological recordings took place 36–48 h after
the chemical mediated transfection took place, whereby the cells were
replated on coverslips coated with laminin. The highly fluorescent
cells displaying the cotransfected enhanced green fluorescent protein
were selected for a giga-seal for the current recording. Borosilicate
glass was used to fabricate the patch electrodes with a resistance
of 2–4 MΩ. At a temperature of 22 °C, a membrane
potential of −60 mV, a sampling frequency of 10 kHz, and a
low-pass filter set at 2 kHz, an integrated patch amplifier (IPA)
was used to execute the whole-cell patch-clamp technique (IPA, Sutter
Instruments, Novato, CA) using their SutterPatch Software v. 1.1.1
to digitize membrane currents for a short period. The extracellular
solution contained (values are in mM): 150 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with
NaOH. The pipette solution contains (values are in mM): 110 CsF, 30
CsCl, 4 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 trypsin–EDTA solution
B (0.25%), EDTA (0.05%), and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH.
Double-barrel glass (theta tube) was used for constant washing out
of the cell from one barrel while the other supplying the cell with
the compound of interest using a high-speed piezo solution switcher
(Automate Scientific, Berkeley, CA). A 10–90% solution exchange
occurred typically at 500 ms, represented by the open tip potential
that was recorded during the application of solutions of different
ionic strengths that resulted from the expulsion of the patch from
the electrode to estimate the speed of solution exchange. Six viable
cells were considered for the sample size to obtain the average inhibition
by the derivative of interest. To ensure the safety of the cell and
validate the results of the antagonist, the cell was then resupplied
with the control (glutamate alone) after compound washout, which,
to consider viable, should be almost identical to the glutamate-induced
current before the application of the antagonist. The exact data analysis
of this process is provided in the Supporting Information. Data acquired were analyzed using Igor Pro7 (Wave
Metrics, Inc). Receptor desensitization (τdes) and
deactivation rates were estimated by a single exponential fitting
of the current decay curve, starting from 95% of the peak to the baseline
current. The currents were evoked by the application of 10 mM glutamate
for desensitization (500 ms) and 20 ms of the same concentrated glutamate
for deactivation.
