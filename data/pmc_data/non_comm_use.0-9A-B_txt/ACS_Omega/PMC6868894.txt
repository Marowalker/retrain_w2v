Iron
stents, with superior mechanical properties and controllable
degradation behavior, have potential for use as feasible substitutes
for nondegradable stents in the treatment of coronary artery occlusion.
However, corrosion renders the iron surface hard to modify with biological
molecules to accelerate endothelialization and solve restenosis. The
objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using
endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to rapidly adhere onto iron surfaces
with the assistance of anti-CD34-modified magnetic nanoparticles.
Transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
Thermogravimetric analysis, XRD, and anti-CD34 immunofluorescence
suggested that anti-CD34 and citric acid were successfully modified
onto Fe3O4, and Prussian blue staining demonstrated
the selectivity of the as-prepared nanoparticles for EPCs. Under an
external magnetic field (EMF), numerous nanoparticles or EPCs attached
onto the surface of iron pieces, particularly the side of the iron
pieces exposed to flow conditions, because iron could be magnetized
under the EMF, and the magnetized iron has an edge effect. However,
the uniform adhesion of EPCs on the iron stent was completed because
of the weakening edge effect, and the sum of adherent EPCs was closely
linked with the magnetic field (MF) intensity, which was validated
by the complete covering of EPCs on the iron stent upon exposure to
a 300 mT EMF within 3 h, whereas almost no cells were observed on
the iron stent without an EMF. These results verify that this method
can efficiently promote EPC capture and endothelialization of iron
stents.

Introduction
Cardiovascular stents were first introduced
for the therapy of
coronary artery obstructions in the late 1980s. To date, stents have
been widely applied in various locations within the vascular system
and have proven their effectiveness in treating narrow arteries.1 Limited by the clinical duration of the stent,
the interventional effect should be temporary, yet 6–12 months
are demanded for the whole process of healing and re-endothelialization.2 Beyond the short intervention time, the stents
impede the lumen stretching and contraction associated with later
favorable remodeling and vessel reactivity where the stent is placed,
making this site a latent nidus for thrombosis, restenosis, and chronic
inflammation.3 Therefore, researchers suggest
that degradable stents should possess long-term effects and that the
desired degradation time should be within 12–24 months.4 In addition, when used in growing children, a
standard stent requires redilatation after a few years to avoid fixed
obstruction of the growing vessel.5 Thus,
excluding emergency situations, stents for pediatric patients should
not be applied if the maximal diameter of the stent could not satisfy
the matching requirements for an adult vessel size. Degradable stents
allow alternative therapeutic strategies,6 which have the potential to heal arterial vessels to prevent late
stent thrombosis and in-stent restenosis3 via suspending the interference of the stents to the vessel wall,
and may be used to clinically treat congenital heart disease in babies7 to avoid surgical intervention for redilatation
and critical limb ischemia in adults.8 Another
advantage of degradable stents is that they will not hinder any subsequent
surgery at the target vessel.9

Because
its mechanical properties are superior to those of 316L
stainless steel (316L SS), iron has potentially valuable application
for use in degradable stents and is considered more suitable than
Mg alloys and polymers.10 Iron stents (Fe
> 99.8%) were implanted in the descending aorta of animals11−14 and showed favorable biological performances,15 while the degradation period was considered too long for
stent applications14 because the strut
of the iron stent did not disappear completely within 18 months.11 For this reason, great focus has been placed
on accelerating the degradation of iron-based stents.16−18 Based on the analyses of the intimal thickness and area as well
as occlusion rate, iron stents do not have an advantage over 316L
SS or cobalt chromium stents, although they have been shown to be
safe in some studies. For example, the degrees of narrowings of the
luminal area of cobalt chromium stents and iron stents were ∼41
and 34%, respectively, after 28 days of implantation,13 and the degrees of narrowings of the luminal area of 316L
SS stents and iron stents were ∼36 and 40%, respectively, after
60 days of implantation.12 There were obvious
developments of in-stent restenosis for all of the metals.

Restenosis
is a direct result of the vessel injury during balloon
angioplasty and coronary stenting. Vessel injury, which induces persistent
disturbance and delayed endothelial monolayer recovery, will result
in fibrin deposition, inflammatory cell infiltration, and subsequent
neointima formation and vascular remodeling, which is the final trigger
of lumen occlusion.19 To prevent restenosis
and stent thrombosis, a functional endothelium should be established
as soon as possible after stent implantation.20,21 Because of the promising benefits of circulating endothelial progenitor
cells (EPCs) in vascular re-endothelialization after carotid balloon
injury and neovascularization during post-ischemic inflammation,22 the surface of the implanted blood-contacting
biomedical devices was designed to capture EPCs directly from the
blood for in vivo/in situ endothelialization. Anti-CD34, anti-CD133,
or anti-CD31 antibodies were immobilized on the surface of the devices
via physical adsorption, electrostatic interaction, or covalent immobilization
to attract EPCs for rapid endothelialization.23−26 More importantly, anti-CD34 antibody
has been grafted onto a cardiovascular stent (Genous R-stent) to capture
the EPC in the blood to accelerate endothelialization,24 demonstrating the safety and feasibility of
this method. Nevertheless, one of the complexities is that corrosion
is the major obstacle preventing modification of iron surfaces with
biomolecules to accelerate endothelialization.

Some studies
have shown that cells magnetically tagged by endocytosis
of superparamagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were homed to a site of
arterial injury27,28 and were rapidly captured onto
a magnetic SS or magnesium stent using an external magnetic field
(EMF) positioned outside the body.29−32 The saturation magnetization
(Ms) of these metals is below 10 emu/g, which is far lower than that
of iron (217 emu/g);30 therefore, magnetization
of iron (Figure 1A),
in theory, could exhibit an excellent response to an EMF and then
enhance the surrounding magnetic field (MF) intensity under the same
EMF. We hypothesized that via magnetic-related mechanisms, EPCs, which
are specifically tagged with MNPs (Figure 1B), could be guided to the magnetic iron
stent for re-endothelization. Compared to an isolated EMF, the magnetic-field
intensity around a stent might increase in the presence of iron by
superimposing the EMF and the responsive field of the magnetizing
iron stent, making it possible to maximize the fraction of captured
MNP-tagged cells by these techniques (Figure 1C).

Figure 1 (A) Because of ferromagnetism, magnetization
under an EMF converts
ferromagnetic domains in iron from a random arrangement to be parallel
to the EMF. (B) Schematic diagram of EPCs expressing the CD34 membrane
protein and anti-CD34-coated MNPs and EPCs magnetically tagged by
anti-CD34-coated MNPs. (C) Superimposition of the EMF and the responsive
field of the magnetizing iron enables the iron stent to magnify the
surrounding MF intensity and augment the quantity of captured MNP-tagged
EPCs for rapid endothelialization.

To examine this concept experimentally, we first formulated and
characterized anti-CD34 antibodies (anti-CD34)- and citric acid (CA)-conjugated
Fe3O4 that could target EPCs and proceeded to
identify optimal MNP cell-loading conditions with respect to MNP usage.
Ultimately, the possibility of in vitro delivering of EPCs to the
surfaces of iron stents was assessed in a model flow-loop system in
the presence of MNPs and an EMF by using paired permanent magnets.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of MNPs
Transmission
electron microscopy
(TEM) micrographs of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CA, and Fe3O4@CA–CD34 are shown
in Figure 2. Fe3O4 has a more angular morphology with a size of
approximately 10–20 nm and tended to aggregate. Fe3O4@CA was uniformly round with diameters of approximately
10 nm without aggregation, while the morphology of Fe3O4@CA–CD34 was irregularly shaped and elongated with
lengths from 20 to 60 nm. These results demonstrate that CA and anti-CD34
antibody were successfully modified onto Fe3O4, while grafting with antibodies caused cross-linking of the MNPs.
The size of MNPs for in vivo applications must be smaller than 200
nm to avoid filtration in the spleen and larger than 5 nm to avoid
renal clearance.33,34 A longer half-life in vivo has
been substantiated for nanoparticles with elongated shapes (e.g.,
filamentous35 or nanoworm36) compared with nanospheres. Therefore, Fe3O4@CA–CD34 has been considered suitable for in vivo applications.

of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CA, and
Fe3O4@CA–CD34.

Further analysis was performed by means of IR spectroscopy. Figure 3A shows the IR spectrum
of the different MNPs dispersed in KBr. The band at 596 cm–1 corresponds to Fe–O vibrations, indicating that Fe3O4 was successfully prepared. Compared with the Fe3O4 spectrum, the spectrum obtained after the addition
of CA exhibited new peaks at 2980/1446, 2930, 1072, and 873 cm–1 that correspond to the stretching vibration of CH3, CH2, C–O, and C=O, respectively,
demonstrating that CA has bonded to the surface of Fe3O4. Compared with the Fe3O4@CA spectrum,
the spectrum obtained after the addition of anti-CD34 antibody exhibited
new peaks at 1546, 1398, and 808 cm–1 attributed
to amide II vibrations and bending vibrations of C–O and N–H,
respectively, which illustrated the successful immobilization of anti-CD34
antibody onto the Fe3O4@CA surface. An intense
characteristic absorption peak at 1095 cm–1 was
attributed to C–O and CH3 stretching, also indicating
that Fe3O4@CA–CD34 were successfully
manufactured.

of different kinds of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CA, and Fe3O4@CA–BSA (because
of its high price, anti-CD34 antibody was replaced by BSA in these
analysis).

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
in a temperature range of 30–550
°C was used to investigate the thermal decomposition processes
of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CA, and
Fe3O4@CA–BSA to quantitatively analyze
the proportion of CA and protein in the MNPs. The TGA curve of Fe3O4 in Figure 3B reveals a small weight loss rate of approximately
1% due to the evaporation of water at 40–90 °C, which
is in accordance with our previous study.37 The weight loss rate of Fe3O4@CA was greater
than that of Fe3O4, with a value of 5%, which
contributed to the decomposition of CA. The decomposition temperature
of free CA is 175 °C, but the initial decomposition temperature
CA in Fe3O4@CA was 250 °C, indirectly indicating
the interaction between CA and Fe3O4. A continuous
weight loss occurred in Fe3O4@CA–BSA
and reached 14% due to the removal of CA and bovine serum albumin
(BSA). These results demonstrate that CA and protein have been modified
onto nanoparticles. Compared with the linking of protein to Fe3O4 with PEG4000 in our previous study,37 the amount of the modified protein in this research
decreased by approximately 5%, the reason for which is that the high
molecular weight of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) leads to a larger
surface area for protein immobilization.

XRD measurements were
used to identify the crystalline structure
of all MNPs in the dried powder phase. As shown in Figure 3C, all the observed diffraction
peaks in the XRD patterns match well with the characteristic peaks
of the inverse cubic spinel structure (JCPDS 19-0629), indicating
that CA and protein did not influence the crystalline phase purity
of Fe3O4. However, broadening and weakening
of the characteristic diffraction peaks was observed in the CA-modified
nanoparticles, indicating that this additive could constrain the crystal
growth, causing the small crystallite size because CA with large numbers
of COOH could easily chelate the iron from Fe3O4.38 The protein was grafted onto nanoparticles
by CA, and as a consequence, this step did not lead to dramatic changes
in the diffraction peaks as in our previous study.37

Magnetic hysteresis loops of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CA, and Fe3O4@CA–BSA
at room temperature were measured with the MF swept back and forth
between +18 and −18 kOe. As seen in Figure 3D, the typical characteristics of superparamagnetic
behavior (no hysteresis behavior) was observed showing almost immeasurable
coercivity and remanence, which demonstrated that these nanoparticles
possess superparamagnetic properties. The Ms values obtained from
the plot are 66.3, 49.3, and 41.0 emu/g for Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CA, and Fe3O4@CA–BSA, respectively. These results proved that the CA and
protein have been integrated into nanoparticles.

Immunofluorescent
staining was used to evaluate the anti-CD34 antibody
grafting by treating different nanoparticles with FITC-conjugated
rabbit anti-goat IgG. The bright-field microscopy images showed that
Fe3O4@CA (Figure 4A) and Fe3O4@CA–CD34 (Figure 4C) dispersed in water;
furthermore, immunofluorescence images corresponding to the bright-field
images showed strong fluorescence for Fe3O4@CA–CD34
(Figure 4D) and little
immunofluorescence for Fe3O4@CA (Figure 4B), indicating that the anti-CD34
antibody was grafted onto CA-coated Fe3O4.

microscopy (A) and immunofluorescence (B) images of
Fe3O4@CA, and the bright-field microscopy (C)
and immunofluorescence (D) images of Fe3O4@CA–CD34.
EPCs were incubated with Fe3O4@CA (E) and Fe3O4@CA–CD34 (F), and then cellular labeling
was visualized histochemically with prussian blue (PB) staining, which
indicated that anti-CD34-coated MNPs have selective affinity to EPCs.

Affinity of MNPs to EPCs
To evaluate
the selective
affinity of Fe3O4@CA–CD34 for EPCs, adherent
EPCs were incubated with Fe3O4@CA and Fe3O4@CA–CD34 for 5 min, the iron closely bonded
on the cells was stained with PB, and the cells were counterstained
with crystal violet. The results showed that almost all EPCs incubated
with Fe3O4@CA–CD34 exhibited positive
iron staining (black) on the membrane (Figure 4E), but only a few of cells incubated with
Fe3O4@CA exhibited positive iron staining (Figure 4F), indicating that
Fe3O4@CA–CD34 has selective affinity
for EPCs.

Cell Viability at Different MNP Concentrations
The
influence of different concentrations of Fe3O4@CA–CD34 on the viability of EPCs needs to be investigated. Figure 5 shows that there
was no difference in the cell morphology between EPCs without incubation
with nanoparticles (Figure 5A) and EPCs incubated with nanoparticles at a concentration
of 100 μg/mL (Figure 5B). Meanwhile, there were no significant differences in cell
viability of two groups (Figure 5D). However, the number and morphology of cells incubated
with nanoparticles at a concentration of 500 μg/mL (Figure 5C) were inferior
to those of the other groups, and the viability of EPCs incubated
with Fe3O4@CA–CD34 at a concentration
of 500 μg/mL (Figure 5D) was significantly lower than that of the others, indicating
that Fe3O4@CA–CD34 have significant cytotoxicity
in high concentrations. Thus, the concentration of nanoparticles for
capturing EPCs was set to 100 μg/mL.

EPCs incubated with different concentrations
of Fe3O4@CA–CD34 [(A) 0 μg/mL;

of the EPCs incubated with the different concentration of Fe3O4@CA–CD34 for 1 and 3 d (D).

Capturing Ability of Iron to MNPs
Because of its ferromagnetic
properties, iron can increase the MF intensity of its surroundings
by magnetization. To test this statement, an MNP suspension was pumped
through a circular tube system with or without an iron piece under
different EMFs. The remaining MNP concentration in the suspension
was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry
(ICP-OES) and is presented in Figure 6. The residual MNP concentrations in the system without
an iron piece were 20% at an EMF of 300 mT (C) and 90% at an EMF of
100 mT (A) after 30 min, confirming the dependence on the field strength.
The presence of iron under the same EMF increased the MF intensity
around the iron and caused a further depletion of the MNP suspension
[300 mT: 20% without iron (C) vs 4% with iron (D); 100 mT: 90% without
iron (A) vs 65% with iron (B)]. Thus, a high MF intensity can capture
more MNPs, and iron can be magnetized to increase the surrounding
MF intensity. Under the same EMF, MNPs were captured onto the iron
surface but not onto 316L SS, also indicating that there was a higher
MF intensity around iron than around 316L SS because of the high magnetizability
of iron.

time points (A): 100 mT without iron, (B): 100 mT with iron, (C):
300 mT without iron, and (D): 300 mT with iron (Left). Images of absorbed
MNPs around the iron and 316L SS pieces after circulation for 30 min

Capturing Ability of Iron
Piece/Stent to Magnetic Tagged EPCs
To determine whether
Fe3O4@CA–CD34
can capture and deliver EPCs onto iron in the presence of an applied
EMF of 300 mT, the number of adherent cells on the different samples
was used to estimate the ability of MNP to capture and deliver EPCs;
representative images are shown in Figure 7. Without an EMF, few EPCs adhered onto the
iron pieces, while many EPCs adhered onto the iron pieces in the presence
of a 300 mT of EMF for 1 h. It is important to note that the side
of the iron piece was completely covered by EPCs. These results indicated
that the iron pieces were beneficial to capturing EPCs magnetically
tagged by Fe3O4@CA–CD34 and that the
edge effect of the side strengthened this capability.

Figure 7 EPC adhesion onto the
surface (A) and the side (C) of iron pieces
assisted by anti-CD34-coated MNPs in the absence of an EMF and EPC
adhesion onto the surface (B) and the side (D) of iron pieces assisted
by anti-CD34-coated MNPs in the presence of a 300 mT EMF under flow
conditions in vitro for 1 h.

The EPC adhesion onto iron stents assisted by MNPs and an EMF under
flow conditions in vitro was studied. For this, a suspension containing
EPCs at a density of 5 × 104/mL and Fe3O4@CA–CD34 at a concentration of 100 μg/mL
were circulated in a closed flow chamber system at a flow rate of
1 m/s. Iron stents were placed into this system and exposed to EMFs
of 100 and 300 mT for 1 and 3 h. The adherent cells were stained with
rhodamine 123, and representative images are presented in Figure 8. The stereo-micrograph
and bright-field image of the iron stent are shown in Figure 8A,B. Almost no cells were found
on the surface of the stent after 1 and 3 h of circulation without
EMF application (0 mT). However, an EMF of 100 or 300 mT was applied,
the number of cells captured onto the iron stents significantly increased.
At the same circulation times (1 or 3 h), an EMF of 300 mT caused
more cells to adhere onto the stent than an EMF of 100 mT, indicating
that the high MF intensity could accelerate EPC adhesion. Under an
EMF of 100 mT, the number of cells captured onto the iron stents did
not significantly increase with the circulation time, but the number
of cells captured increased with the circulation time under an EMF
of 300 mT, and the captured cells completely covered the iron stent
after 3 h, indicating that a high magnetic-field intensity could accomplish
EPC coverage within a short time.

(B) Bright-field image
of the iron stent; (C) EPC adhesion onto iron stents assisted by Fe3O4@CA–CD34 and different EMF (0, 100 and
300 mT) for 1 and 3 h under flow conditions in vitro; cellular labeling
was visualized histochemically with rhodamine 123 staining.

Our previous study proved that the anti-CD34 antibody
and PEG-modified
MNPs could target EPCs and then manipulate these EPCs into a specific
position relative to an EMF in vivo.37 Compared
EPC labeling with MNPs by endocytosis, anti-CD34 coated-MNPs are expected
to be more applicable, particularly for patients requiring emergency
procedures because they could avoid costly and time-consuming procedures,
including the isolation and cultivation of EPCs under GMP conditions
(2 weeks) and the labeling of EPCs with MNPs (16 h) in vitro.

The high magnetizability of iron allows rapid endothelialization
of iron surfaces by the capture of magnetically tagged EPCs. The present
study showed that many EPCs adhered onto iron pieces under an EMF
of 300 mT for 1 h (Figure 7). Importantly, the edge effect of the magnetized iron causes
the side of the iron piece to be completely covered by EPCs. The replacement
of the iron piece by an iron stent reduced the edge effect, so that
the EPCs magenetically tagged by Fe3O4@CA–CD34
entirely adhered onto the exterior of the iron stent within a short
time. The number of captured EPCs on the iron stents increased with
the intensity of the EMF under flow conditions in vitro (Figure 8), especially at
a high MF intensity. Therefore, the magnetic properties of iron can
be used to promote re-endothelialization in the presence of MNPs modified
with anti-CD34 and exposed to an EMF. Unfortunately, accurate quantification
of adherent EPCs was difficult to achieve because of the interference
of MNPs and the corrosion of iron; additionally, the iron surface
was corroded too quickly in the aqueous solution to acquire SEM images.

Conclusions
MNPs with a high affinity for EPCs were prepared
by coating Fe3O4 with CA and anti-CD34 antibody.
Magnetization
of iron led to high adsorption of MNPs and magnetically tagged EPCs
under an EMF. In contrast to massive iron (iron piece), linear iron
(iron stent) results in the uniform adhesion of EPCs on the surface
because of the weakened edge effect. The number of adherent EPCs on
the iron stent was closely related to the EMF, and the whole surface
of the iron stent was occupied by EPCs within 3 h in the presence
of a 300 mT EMF. These results demonstrate that this method could
efficiently promote EPC capture and endothelialization of iron stents.

Experimental
Section
Preparation and Characterization of MNPs
CA-modified
MNPs were prepared by a simple two-step co-precipitation method.38 In a typical reaction, 0.2 g of FeCl2·4H2O and 0.54 g of FeCl3·6H2O were mixed in 50 mL of deionized water for 10 min under
nitrogen protection. While vigorously stirring the reaction mixture,
ammonia solution was introduced dropwise until the pH was increased
to 10, followed by the reaction for 1 h. The solution was heated to
80 °C for 30 min, and the product was denoted as Fe3O4. Then, 1 g of CA in 5 mL of water was added into the
above solution with stirring for 2 h. CA-coated MNPs were separated
by a permanent magnet and washed with water several times, and the
product was denoted as Fe3O4@CA. Fe3O4@CA were ultrasonically dispersed in 30 mL of water
containing 200 mg of MES, 10 mg of EDC, and 10 mg of NHS for 1 h at
room temperature to activate the carboxyl groups, followed by separation
by a permanent magnet and washing with 75% ethanol three times. The
subsequent experiments were carried out under sterile conditions.
The above MNPs were dispersed in 30 mL of sterile phosphate buffered
solution (PBS, pH 7.4) containing anti-CD34 antibodies (specific for
CD34 of humans, rats, cows, pigs, dogs, and rabbits) at 100 rpm for
6 h, separated by a permanent magnet, and then washed with sterile
water several times. Anti-CD34 grafted MNPs were obtained and are
denoted as Fe3O4@PEG–CD34.

The
as-prepared MNPs were characterized by TEM, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR), TGA, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), vibrating
sample magnetometer (VSM), and immunofluorescent staining of the anti-CD34
antibody. TEM was used to obtain the sharp topography and size of
MNPs by employing a JEM-2010 (JEOL, Japan) at an acceleration voltage
of 80 kV in the bright field imaging mode. FTIR spectra of different
MNPs prepared as KBr pellets were obtained using a ST-IR20SX (Nicolet,
USA) to investigate the chemical bonding. Because of its high price,
anti-CD34 antibody in Fe3O4@CA–CD34 is
replaced by BSA in the analysis of TGA, XRD, and VSM. TGA of 15 mg
of powder samples was measured on a NETZSCH STA449C (Jupiter, Germany)
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min to 550 °C under a nitrogen
atmosphere. XRD of different MNPs was recorded with a Philips X’Pert
Pro diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation.
The magnetic hysteresis loop of MNPs was traced using the VSM (Lake
Shore 7410, Lake Shore Cryotronics, America). Magnetization values
were normalized to the mass of the nanoparticles to determine the
specific magnetization (emu per gram of particles). The immunofluorescent
identification of the anti-CD34 antibodies on the as-prepared MNPs
was conducted as follows:39 MNPs were incubated
with 1% BSA for 1 h and then removed by magnetic separation and re-suspended
in water. FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:100) was incubated
for 1 h in the stirring suspension (300 rpm), from which MNPs were
collected by magnetic separation and washed three times with deionized
water. The re-suspended MNPs were immediately observed via a fluorescence
microscope (LEICA DMRX Polarization microscope, Leica Germany).

Affinity of MNPs to EPCs
As described previously, multipotential
mesenchymal stem cells from femoral bone marrow were obtained from
SD rats and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) culture medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, 10 ng/mL
VEGF, 10 ng/mL SCF, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin sulfate
(100 U/mL), at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The medium was
renewed every 2–3 days, and the cells were subcultured regularly
after they reached 70–80% confluence. Third-passage cells were
characterized by immunofluorescent detection of CD34 membrane protein
to prove the differentiation into EPCs.39

To study the ability of MNPs to target EPCs, the adherent
EPCs in a 24-well plate were incubated with serum-free DMEM medium
containing 100 μg/mL Fe3O4@CA and Fe3O4@CA–CD34, respectively. After 10 min of
incubation, the medium was drawn off and the cells were washed with
PBS to remove the nonadherent MNPs. Negative controls were prepared
using the adherent EPCs without incubation with MNPs. Cells were fixed
with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then washed three times
with PBS. To visualize the iron in the MNP-labeled cells, PB staining
was performed by incubating cells for 30 min with 2% potassium ferric–ferrocyanide
(Perl reagent for PB staining) in 6% hydrochloric acid, and then the
cells were washed and counterstained with crystal violet. Finally,
the cells were observed for iron staining using light microscopy.

Cell Viability at Different MNP Concentration
A aliquot
of 300 μL of the EPC suspension (5 × 104/mL)
was placed into a 24-well flat-bottomed plate to culture for 12 h
for cell adhesion. Then, Fe3O4@CA–CD34
was added to co-culture with the cells, and the final concentrations
of MNPs were 0, 100, or 500 μg/mL, respectively. After culturing
for 3 d, the suspension was removed, and every well was washed five
times with PBS. Then, adherent cells were stained with crystal violet
and then observed using light microscopy. After culture for 1 and
3 d, the cell viability was assessed by MTT assay.

Capturing Ability
of Iron to MNPs
The impact that the
iron exerts on the capture ability of magnetic tagged EPCs is crucial
to the analysis concerning whether this theoretical method of iron
stent endothelialization can be applied in practice. Because of ferromagnetism,
the surrounding MF intensity may increase because of the magnetization
of iron. To verify this hypothesis, a solution of Fe3O4@CA–CD34 at a concentration of 100 μg/mL was
circulated in a closed flow chamber system consisting of four basic
modules: a parallel plate flow chamber, a flow loop with silicone
catheter, a reservoir, and a peristaltic pump. Iron pieces were placed
into the parallel plate flow chamber. The flow chamber with and without
iron was exposed to the MF intensities of 100 or 300 mT, and then
the solution in the reservoir was collected after circulation for
different times. Then, the iron concentration in the collected solutions
was detected by ICP-OES (SPECTRO ARCOS; AMETEK, Inc., Kleve, Germany).
While 316L stainless steel (316L SS) and iron pieces were placed into
the parallel plate flow chamber to observe the captured MNPs to evaluate
the magnetizability of different samples.

Capturing Ability of Iron
Piece/Stent to Magnetic Tagged EPCs
In an in vitro cell-capture
experiment, an EPC suspension (5 ×
104/mL) and MNPs (100 μg/mL) were circulated in a
closed flow chamber system at a flow rate of 1 m/s. Iron pieces were
placed into the parallel plate flow chamber. The samples were exposed
under an EMF of 300 mT for 1 h by paired permanent magnets placed
at both sides of the samples. Samples without EMF served as control.
After capturing, the samples were removed, washed with PBS, incubated
with rhodamine 123 (20 μg/mL) for 15 min, and immediately observed
under a fluorescence microscope.

In addition, iron stents were
used to evaluate the magnetic-assisted EPC adhesion under flow conditions
in vitro. An EPC suspension (5 × 104/mL) and MNPs
(100 μg/mL) circulated in a closed flow chamber system at a
flow rate of 1 m/s. Iron stents were placed into the silicone catheter
and exposed to an EMF of 100 and 300 mT for 1 and 3 h by paired permanent
magnets placed at both sides of the stents. Stents without EMF served
as a control. After circulation for different times, the stents were
removed, washed with PBS, and incubated with rhodamine123 for 15 min
and immediately observed under a fluorescence microscope.
