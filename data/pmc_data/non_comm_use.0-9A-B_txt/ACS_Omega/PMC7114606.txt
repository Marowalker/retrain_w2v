Recycling of waste into valuable
products plays a significant role
in sustainable development. Herein, we report the conversion of vehicle
exhaust waste soot into water-soluble fluorescent carbon dots via
a simple acid refluxion method. The obtained carbon dots were characterized
using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. Microscopic techniques
reveal that the prepared carbon material is spherical in shape with
an average particle size of ∼4 nm. Spectroscopic studies exhibited
that the carbon dots are emissive in nature, and the emission is excitation-dependent.
Further, the prepared carbon dots were successfully utilized as a
fluorescent probe for the detection of tartrazine with a limit of
detection of 26 nM. The sensitivity of carbon dots has also been realized
by the detection of trace amounts of tartrazine in commercial soft
drinks. Overall, this work demonstrates the conversion air pollutant
soot into value-added fluorescent nanomaterials toward sensing applications.

Introduction
Conversion of waste
into a value-added material is a trend in research;
owing to this leads sustainable development via recycling of used
and unused scraps, especially soot waste.1 Industries and vehicles exhaust pollutants, such as carbon monoxide,
nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide, which
impose many adverse effects on a living being.2 In the present decade, we cannot completely avoid the usage of fuel
in vehicles owing to the various hurdles on the 100% utilization of
renewable energy resources. Among the various air pollutants, a vehicle
exhaust soot emission consists of higher percentage of carbon with
other elements like N and S from the source of fuel.3 On the other side, researchers are looking for an invention
of a novel, functionalized, and biocompatible nanomaterial for a wide
range of applications.4 The growing research
areas such as bioimaging, biosensing, light-emitting diodes, etc.
are consistently searching of a nanomaterial, which fits for the mentioned
fields; especially in the past one decade, researchers are attracted
by carbon-based nanomaterials owing to their specific properties of
water solubility, fluorescence nature, photo and storage stability,
biocompatibility, etc.5−7 These urge the focused research on improving the
efficiency of a fuel and conversion of pollutants into value-added
products to maintain a sustainable environment.

Carbon dots
(CDs) are widely used as an alternative for organic
fluorophores and heavy metal-containing semiconductor quantum dots
in biomedical, photovoltaic, and sensing applications as well as anti-icing/bioadhesor.8−11 CDs are a new type of nanomaterial that consists of a graphitic
core and an amorphous shell with an average particle size of less
than 10 nm, which shows good water solubility, low toxicity, fluorescence
property, and photostability.12 It can
be generated by various techniques such as electrochemical deposition,13 microwave,14 hydrothermal
and solvothermal methods,15 pyrolysis,16 etc. Their surface is viable for modification
by carbonyl, carboxylic, and amine functional groups, significantly
making them as recognizable by enzymes in the organism. However, most
of the reported CDs were derived from carbon-rich organic molecules
like glucose, cellulose, and phenolic compounds17−19 and biomass
such as algal blooms,20 coriander leaves,21 lotus root,22 radish,23 ginger,24 grass,25 coffee bean shells,26 chitosan27 etc. Conversion of pollutants
into value-added products like CDs using ultrasonication of food waste
has been reported by Lee et al.28 Similarly,
conversion of soot collected from a burning candle,29 tire soot,30 and natural gas31 into CDs and their biological applications have
been reported.32,33 Recently, we have also reported
the fuel waste into fluorescent CDs for sensing applications.34

Food additives are used to improve the
taste, quality, appearance,
and other commercial requirements. Few types of food additives35 are coloring agents (tartrazine and sunset yellow),
flavor enhancers (monosodium glutamate commercially known as Ajinomoto),
artificial sweetener (aspartame and acesulfame K), etc., which are
commonly used in food and beverages. However, most human beings are
allergic to such food additives, which cause many adverse health issues
like hives or diarrhea, asthma, rhinitis and sinusitis, itching, rashes,
and swelling.36,37 For instance, a food colorant
like tartrazine is an azo group dye molecule, whose limit of existence
in the food content is fixed by the World Health Organization and
the Food and Agricultural Organization, is 50 mg/kg. However, in most
of the commercial food beverages as well as in the domestic preparations,
the level of the coloring agent is not measured according to the WHO
report, which may cause38 few of the abovementioned
negative effects. Hence, the detection of tartrazine has gained significance,
and a few related reports could be found in the literature.39 Aloe-derived carbon dots were used to detect
tartrazine in a food sample.40 Yuan et
al. detected a well-known food colorant, sunset yellow, from the analysis
of soft drinks with a satisfactory result by means of fluorescent
CDs.41 Even though a number of methods
and materials are available for the detection of food additives, the
high cost, tedious procedures, difficulty in synthesis, etc. motivate
us to bring a simple, sensitive, and cost-effective material for the
same matter.

In this work, the conversion of pollutant (exhaust
soot derived
from a diesel-fueled lorry) into a value-added product (CDs) is reported
via the facile one-step acid refluxion method. The fluorescence nature
of the CDs has been effectively used as a probe for the detection
of tartrazine. The detection was extended in commercially available
soft drinks.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Carbon Dots
Carbon dots were synthesized
from a vehicle exhaust soot by a one-pot acid refluxion method using
nitric acid.42 In brief, the soot was collected
from a diesel engine lorry exhaust pipeline. The collected soot (1
g) was mixed with 200 mL of 5 M nitric acid, and the mixture was refluxed
at 100 °C for 12 h. Consequently, the reflexed mixture was kept
aside without disturbance to cool down to room temperature naturally.
It is observed that the reaction mixture was turned to a reddish brown
color with black precipitate deposition at the bottom. Furthermore,
the solution mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to separate
the bulkier carbon particles and unreacted soot material, which yields
clear reddish brown color carbon dots. The brown fluorescent supernatant
was collected, neutralized with sodium carbonate, and filtered via
a 0.22 μm membrane filter (cellulose) to remove more than micrometer-sized
particles and unreacted materials. Following that, the solution was
dialyzed using a dialysis membrane bag (1000 MWCO) for 32 h. This
process is essential to remove the less than nanometer-sized particles,
small molecules, and removal of excess salt to derive the pure carbon
dots (dialysis water is changed every 6 h). The clear dark brown solution
was collected, and the volume was reduced via vacuum distillation
and dried in a vacuum oven. Finally, dried fluorescent carbon dots
were collected (55% product yield) and stored at room temperature.

Surface Characterization
The SEM images of collected
soot and the derived CDs are given in Figure 1a,b, respectively, and the elemental composition
details with the EDAX spectrum is shown in Figure S1. The SEM analysis clearly illustrates that the waste soot
particles are rich in carbon (85.45%) and oxygen (14.54%), and the
CDs derived from the soot after acid refluxion consist of aggregates
of carbon nanoparticles, having nearly spherical morphology with relatively
regular size and homogeneity. The EDAX data analysis exposes that
CDs mainly consists of C (26.9%) and O (42.7%), which demonstrates
that CDs are made up of an oxygenous carbon structure. Other elements
also present in trace amounts may originate from the precursor soot.
The powder XRD pattern of carbon dots is shown in Figure 2, which exhibits a sharp diffraction
peak at 2θ = 29° and also many small diffraction peaks
at 2θ = 32, 35, 38, 42, and 48°. It indicates that the
carbon atoms are arranged in a considerably unsystematic manner as
well as an amorphous nature induced by more oxygen-containing groups
on the surface of CDs. Figure 3a shows the TEM image and histogram of CDs, and it reveals
that the particles are quasi-spherical in shape with a nanometer size.
The average particle size of CDs is in the range of 3–4 nm,
and the size distribution is displayed in the histogram plot (Figure 3b). Figure 4 shows the AFM image of the
derived CDs, and it exposes that most of the particles are spherical-shaped
and well dispersed. The height profile (Figure S2) indicates the maximum of 6 nm of size from the surface,
and the surface looks quite smooth, which confirms the uniform distribution
of the particles on the surface. The particles size derived from TEM
and AFM are consistent with each other, and both characterizations
confirm that the prepared CDs are nanometer-sized particles.

μm scale (right-hand
side) and the same in a three-dimensional view (left-hand side).

The FT-IR analysis of the prepared CDs is shown
in Figure 5a, which
portrays that the
presence of peak positions at 1795 and 3410 cm–1 were associated with the stretching vibrations of carbonyl (C=O)
and hydroxyl (−OH) groups, respectively. The characteristic
peaks at 1330 and 829 cm–1 were due to the stretching
vibrations of sp2 and sp3 C–H, and the
peak located at 1593 cm–1 corresponds to the C=C
stretching vibration. The 2437 cm–1 peak is assigned
for NO3– stretching vibration. The FT-IR
data revealed the formation of unsaturated carbon during the carbonization
process and the presence of rich oxygen-containing groups (carboxyl,
carbonyl, and hydroxyl) on the surface of CDs. Raman analysis (Figure S3) exposed that the appearance of D and
G bands of the prepared CDs were at 1351 and 1552 cm–1, respectively. The existence of D and G bands illustrate the confirmation
of sp3-hybridized amorphous carbon particles and the ε2g mode of sp2-hybridized graphitic carbon atoms,
respectively. Further, the ratio of ID/IG of 1.01 clearly represents the prepared
CDs consisting of a nanocrystalline graphitic core surrounded by a
disorder/amorphous shell. The proton NMR analysis of CDs is shown
in Figure S4, which reveals that the sp3 C–H proton is present at the region 1–2 ppm,
carbonyl, hydroxyl, and ether protons are present at 3–4 pm,
and the aromatic sp2 and aldehyde proton is an occurrence
in the region 7–9 ppm. The solid-state 13C NMR spectrum
is shown in Figure S5, and the signal at
190 ppm was assigned to carboxyl carbon (COO−), while the signal
at 125 ppm was designated to aromatic carbons. Further, the signal
around 97 ppm is for carbonyl carbons (C–O), and the signal
in the range of 6–50 ppm was assigned to carbon bonded with
hydrogen or other carbons. Zeta potential measurement exposed that
CDs are negatively charged with a value of −0.2 mV, which specifies
the presence of a negatively charged functional group on the surface
of CDs and the surface is the hydrophilic nature. This imparts the
high solubility of CDs in water. Further, the nature of bonding on
the surface of CDs is characterized by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
technique and is shown in Figure S6a. The
survey spectrum represented the presence of C, O, N, and Na (285,
530, 407, and 497 eV) elements. Nitrogen and sodium ions originated
from the oxidative acid treatment and neutralization process. Hence,
our interest is to analyze the carbon and oxygen bonding nature on
the surface of CDs. So, the deconvoluted spectra of C 1s and O 1s
were thoroughly examined and presented in Figure S6b,c. In the C 1s deconvoluted spectrum, the derivative peaks
at 282.9, 284.5, and 287.9 eV were assigned to −C–C–,
−C=C/C–N, and C=O, respectively. Similarly,
the peaks located in the O 1s deconvoluted spectrum at 531.3, 533.3,
and 536.1 eV were designated to the bonding of −C=O,
−C–OH, and −C–O–C–, respectively.
From the results of NMR, FT-IR, and XPS measurements, we have visualized
the structure of the prepared material (CDs), which consists of various
functional moieties and bonding nature on its surface.

Figure 5 FT-IR spectrum of CDs.

Photophysical Characterization and Fluorescence
Stability Studies
The UV–visible absorption spectrum
of CDs is shown in Figure 6a, and it exhibits
a sharp peak at 295 nm, which corresponds to π–π*
transitions in the aromatic C=C bond in the carbon core. A
broad shoulder in the region of 330–450 nm is due to n–π* transitions in the C=O bond, which
originates from the surface functional groups of CDs. As similar to
the reported carbon dots, the prepared CDs also exhibit the excitation-dependent
emissive property (Figure 6b). The emission maximum is centered at 425 nm at an excitation
of 360 nm. The origin of the fluorescence property of the derived
CDs may arise from the various defects present on the surface of CDs.34 Further, the fluorescence decay of carbon dots
shown in Figure 6c
is fitted by a multiexponential function [F(t) = A1 exp(−t/τ1)
+ A2 exp(−t/τ2) + A3 exp(−t/τ3)] with the lifetimes of τ1 =
0.56 ns (18%), τ2 = 1.78 ns (35%), and τ3 = 5.21 ns (47%), and the average lifetime is calculated as
τavg = 3.17 ns. The multiple lifetimes of CDs are
due to a wide range of chemical environments on the surface of CDs.43 The quantum yield (φ) of CDs is determined
using quinine sulfate as a reference.44 For the measurement of φ, the optical density of CDs in water
(η = 1.33) was fixed to 0.1 at a wavelength of 366 nm. Fluorescence
quantum yield (ϕF) for CDs was calculated by using eq 1 1  where the subscript “S”
refers to the samples, the subscript “R” refers to quinine
sulfate, A is the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, I is the integrated emission area, and η is the solvent
refraction index. The quantum yield for CDs is found to be 3%, which
is good enough for various sensing applications.

Figure 6 (a) UV–visible
absorption, (b) corrected emission spectra
at different excitation wavelengths, and (c) time-resolved fluorescence
decay (λexi = 360 nm) of CDs.

Further, it is necessary to analyze fluorescence stability of CDs
for versatile applications. The stability is investigated under four
different parameters such as storage time, pH, light irradiation,
and ionic strength. The detailed results are depicted in Figure S7, which explores that the fluorescence
property of CDs remains stable for up to 90 days. It shows a higher
fluorescence nature at the neutral pH, and there was a pH-dependent
fluorescence behavior. Optimum fluorescence behavior in the pH range
of 4–9 and lower of higher of that leads to diminishing in
fluorescence ability. Photostability of CDs is checked by UV light
irradiation for a period of 2 h, and the quite stable nature of CDs
is found. The effect of ionic strength is checked with addition of
maximum of 1 M NaCl in CDs, and it is observed that there is not much
variation in the fluorescence property in the presence of NaCl. So,
the prepared CDs exhibit stability in different environments, which
may extend its utilization in biological fields.

Sensing of
Tartrazine
Tartrazine is one of the most
widely used food coloring agents, and its excess limit in food may
cause allergic symptoms to human beings. So, it is essential to detect
tartrazine in food samples. For this purpose, we have adopted a highly
sensitive and simple analytical methodology, namely, the fluorescence
quenching technique. The fluorescence quenching measurements of CDs
in the presence of various concentrations of tartrazine (0.1–6
μM) were conducted, and the spectrum is displayed in Figure 7a. Upon increasing
the concentration of tartrazine, the fluorescence intensity of CDs
is found to regularly decrease. The sensitivity of CDs is estimated
from the slope of the plot (Figure 7b) between the relative change (ΔF = F0 – F) in
fluorescence intensity and tartrazine concentration. For tartrazine
concentration in the range from 0.1 to 0.5 μM, the plot showed
an excellent linear trend with a slope of 1.56 × 108 M–1 and the LOD was calculated to be 26 nM. The
mechanism of fluorescence quenching of CDs by tartrazine may either
be due to the excited state energy transfer or inner filter effect.
Since both the CDs and tartrazine exhibit absorption in the same region,
the most possible quenching mechanism is the inner filter effect.
A similar type of sensing mechanism was proposed in the literature.45 The time-resolved fluorescence technique is
employed to understand the sensing mechanism. Figure S8 shows the fluorescence decay of CDs and with tartrazine.
As expected, the fluorescence decay is not altered even in the presence
of the highest concentration of tartrazine; thus, the quenching type
is static with an inner filter effect.

Figure 7 (a) Fluorescence quenching
study of CDs in the absence and presence
of various concentrations of tartrazine (0.1–6 μM) in
water. (b) Detection limit plot.

Since the possibility of occurrence of few metal ions in food products
along with coloring agents is high, it is essential to study the interference
of metal ions at the same time as sensing of tartrazine. To understand
the role of metal ions on the fluorescence quenching of CDs by tartrazine,
we have conducted the interference studies with various metal ions.
CDs were exposed to various metal ions (1 μM), and fluorescence
spectra were recorded. Surprisingly, the Fe3+ ion quenches
the fluorescence of CDs predominantly. Figure 8 shows the selectivity plot of CDs with metal
ions. Further, to quantify Fe3+ ion sensing, the fluorescence
spectrum of CDs was recorded as a function of Fe3+ ion,
as shown. The fluorescence spectrum of CDs was gradually decreased
with the increasing concentration of Fe3+ ion (Figure S9a). The limit of detection of the Fe3+ ion was calculated using the three (σ/slope) relations.
The linearity was observed for the plot of fluorescence intensity
change against the lower concentration of Fe3+ ion (Figure S9b). The lowest detection limit was determined
to be 13 nM. A combined XPS and FT-IR result indicated that there
are carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amine functional groups on the surface
of the as-synthesized CDs. Therefore, it could be inferred that CDs
can form complex with Fe3+ ions through such functional
groups, resulting in fluorescence quenching with high selectivity/sensitivity.
Similar reports are available in the literature.46−48

Figure 8 Selectivity plot of CDs
with various metal ions (1 μM).

Intriguingly, both tartrazine and Fe3+ ion quench the
CD fluorescence with LOD values of 26 and 13 nM, respectively. In
this higher sensitivity, it is very difficult to distinguish the one
that quenches the fluorescence of CDs. To get rid of the mentioned
issue, we are giving remedy for sensitive detection of tartrazine
even if Fe3+ ions persist in the solution. Based on our
experimental observations, the selective sensing of tartrazine could
be achieved by the addition of 1 mM potassium thiocyanate to solution
mixtures. Since Fe3+ can readily complex with potassium
thiocyanate and it is not free to quench the fluorescence of CDs,
in this way, one can qualitatively detect the tartrazine in the mixture.
The effect of interference of other food additives, such as monosodium
glutamate (flavor enhancer) and acesulfame K (artificial sugar) has
also been investigated, and the results are shown in Figure S10. The fluorescence of CDs is not quenched by both
monosodium glutamate and acesulfame K. However, in the presence of
tartrazine, the strong quenching was observed. Hence, the prepared
CDs are prospective materials for the detection of tartrazine even
with other food additives.

Detection in Soft Drinks
The prepared
fluorescent CDs
were employed to detect the trace level of tartrazine in various soft
drink samples. The results of the pretreated soft drinks spiked with
known concentrations of tartrazine are shown in Table 1. The excellent recoveries ranging from 87
to 100.6% were attained. These results signify the accuracy and reliability
of the prepared CDs toward the determination of tartrazine in commercial
soft drinks.

Conclusions
In
summary, successful conversion of waste soot into fluorescent
CDs by a simple one-pot method is demonstrated. The fluorescence property
of the derived CDs was effectively used to detect tartrazine through
a turn-off fluorescence method. Further, this method is successfully
employed to detect tartrazine in soft drinks. Thus, the prepared CDs
could be used for selective and sensitive determination of tartrazine
in foodstuff products. Overall, this work demonstrated the conversion
of a vehicle soot to a value-added product and the same has been successfully
utilized for sensing applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
Waste soot was collected from
a diesel engine lorry exhaust pipeline. Ultrapure water was used for
the synthesis of carbon dots and all measurements. A dialysis membrane
bag was purchased from HiMedia, and a dialysis tube Float-A-Lyzer
was purchased from Synergy Scientific Services. Tartrazine was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as such without further purification.
Monosodium glutamate and acesulfame K were procured from TCL chemicals.
The commercial coloring agent (Kesari powder) was purchased from a
nearby provisional store.

The particle size and morphology of
the synthesized CDs were investigated by high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM; JEOL JEM-2100; with an accelerating voltage
of 120 kV). The TEM specimen was prepared by dropping a diluted CD
solution onto a carbon-coated copper grid followed by the evaporation
of the water solvent. SEM measurement and EDAX analysis were done
by using Nova NANO SEM 600 from FEI Company, Netherlands. The FT-IR
spectrum was recorded by using a JASCO FT-IR ATR 6300 spectrometer
at room temperature in the range of 4000–400 cm–1. 1H NMR (500 MHz) and 13C NMR (125, 100 MHz)
spectra of CDs were recorded on a Bruker NMR spectrometer in D2O with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Topographic
analysis is done with Park Systems (XE-100 AFM) for an area of 10
× 10 μm scale with a resolution of <1.5 nm. Absorption
spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lamda 25 UV–visible
spectrophotometer. The fluorescence quenching measurements were carried
out with an Hitachi-made fluorescence spectrometer (model: F-4500).
Time-resolved fluorescence decays were obtained by the time-correlated
single photon counting (TCSPC) technique, exciting the sample at a
360 nm LED source. Data analysis was carried out by the software provided
by IBH (DAS-6), which is based on deconvolution techniques using the
nonlinear least squares method, and the quality of the fit is ascertained
with a value of χ2 < 1.1.

Sensing of Tartrazine in
Soft Drinks
The soft drink
samples were procured from a local superstore and used as is. In a
typical assay, 0.3 mL of CDs is added to 2.7 mL of soft drinks in
a cuvette and fluorescence was recorded. Further, the tartrazine solution
(up to 30 μL; the maximum concentration of tartrazine is 6 μM)
was gradually added into the CD solution and the solution was mixed
well prior to the fluorescence spectrum being recorded.
