In this study, the electrochemical
breakdown potentials (Eb) of NiTi stents
were assessed in correlation
to their nonmetallic inclusion fractions in the extra low inclusion
(ELI) range (inclu.% < 1% in area fraction, average size <39
μm). Quantitative investigations were performed to study the
role of nonmetallic inclusions during pitting corrosion. Two stent
samples with different inclusion fractions were fabricated using commercial
NiTi tubes for studying the corrosion and mechanism. A survey of seven
commercial stents in Europe was also conducted. Dependence was observed
between the breakdown potentials and the inclusion fractions in the
ELI stent (inclu.% = 0.2–0.8%), in which the breakdown potentials
were found to be inversely proportional to inclusion fractions and
densities (Eb dropped from ∼800
to ∼400 mV). No breakdown occurred on the samples using high-purity
NiTi materials (inclu.% < 0.1%). The roles of inclusions in pitting
mechanisms were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
characterizations. The microstructural evidence showed that the impact
of TiC and Ti2NiOx was very
different in the pitting process. A maximum inclu.% ≤ 0.9%
was required for obtaining Eb ≥
600 mV to meet the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA’s) in
vivo safety acceptance (low risk up to 6 months postimplantation).
The high-purity stents (inclu.% < 0.1%) did not exhibit corrosion
susceptibility until 1000 mV, suggesting superior corrosion resistance
and thus long-term in vivo safety.

Introduction
The long-term safety
of stents “in service” is the
most important specification besides their mechanical functionality.
It is well known that the environment of a stent in service is rather
extreme, combining contact to corrosive body fluids and fatigue loading
in vessels. This may endanger the long-term structural integrity of
the devices, causing subsequent Ni release, early fracture, fatigue
failure, and most of the postimplantation complications.1−4 Intrinsically, high-purity NiTi alloys, widely used as self-expandable
stents, exhibit excellent biocompatibility and high corrosion resistance
thanks to the protection of a uniform thin layer of TiO2 naturally formed on the surface.1 For
biomedical applications, extensive research and highly restricted
regulatory standards have been dedicated to understand and to guarantee
the quality of the NiTi devices.2 Among
these studies, corrosion and fatigue resistances are found to be the
two main properties of high-quality NiTi devices. It has been proven
that the two properties are highly dependent on the device surface
finishing and the nonmetallic inclusion fraction (oxides and/or carbides).
Recent studies on fatigue resistance have clarified the role of nonmetallic
inclusions in NiTi stents, showing that high-purity NiTi exhibited
much superior medium- and high-cycle fatigue resistance and highlighting
the respective role of the nature, chemistry, size, and density of
the inclusions in the degradation of fatigue performances.3 These inclusions are known to be due to interstitial
impurities such as oxygen and carbon from raw materials and the ingot
melting environment.4 The formation of
oxides and carbides usually occurs after the solidification step of
NiTi ingots. These inclusions, dispersed in the bulk material, are
generally Ti2NiOx and TiC,
displaying micrometric sizes. The area fraction, size, and density
are the three parameters used to characterize the nonmetallic inclusions
of NiTi devices. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
F20635 standard requires a maximum allowable
fraction of 2.8% (area %) and a dimension no larger than 39.0 μm.4 Aiming at improving the fatigue and corrosion
resistance of stents in service, most stent producers have imposed
stricter criteria on inclusions, limited to 1.0% in area fraction
called extra low inclusion (ELI) and 12.9 μm as a maximum size,
for commercial products.6 However, the
role of nonmetallic inclusions in the corrosion mechanism of NiTi
stents was much less visited when compared to the studies on fatigue
resistance and surface engineering.7−9 In the literature, corrosion
assessments are usually performed without the quantification of inclusions
on a NiTi plate or wire samples, on which the corrosion resistance
was found to be very sensitive to the surface finishing.10−12 As a consequence, the dependence could not be determined between
breakdown potentials and inclusion fractions. Regarding the chemistry
of the inclusions, Hwang et al.13 reported
that the TiC inclusions could lead to a local galvanic coupling with
the NiTi matrix since these particles were shown to be cathodic with
respect to the matrix. As to NiTi stents, non-ELI (inclu.% > 1%),
a statistical study performed by M. Wohlschlögel et al.14 proved that the inclusion size could affect
the corrosion susceptibility of electropolished NiTi stents, i.e.,
the larger the inclusion size, the lower the corrosion resistance.
This work suggested that the inclusions and inclusion-induced defects
(strings and voids) could act as sites and crevices during the potentiodynamic
polarization test and subsequently lead to an electrochemical breakdown.
However, no microstructural observations were provided to understand
the role of inclusions (type, area fraction, or density) in the corrosion
mechanisms. To clarify the role of inclusions and the related defects
in corrosion susceptibility, the present work aims at investigating
quantitatively the inclusion chemistry, fraction, size, and density
and their influences on pitting damages.

We followed a two-fold
strategy: (a) two “model”
stents were fabricated that conformed to ASTM F8615 surface finishing from fully characterized NiTi tubes involving
two different vol % of inclusions (both belonging to the so-called
ELI class of Nitinol), and a first correlation between the inclusion
fraction and corrosion resistance has been established; (b) a validation
procedure of the established dependency is performed using seven different
commercial stents (F86 finishing) with various inclusion fractions,
confirming the drastic sensitivity of the corrosion behavior with
respect to inclusions. The correlative study between the corrosion
resistance and inclusions was aimed to clarify the susceptibility
and mechanism of the inclusion-induced pitting corrosion in ELI NiTi
stents.

Materials and Methods
Stent Samples’ Realization and Specifications
Two model stent samples (Stents A and B) were fabricated for this
study using two different ELI NiTi tubes (Tubes A and B) compliant
with the ASTM F2633-0716 standard (nominal
Ni50.8 atom %, 500 mm in length, 2 mm in outer diameter, and 0.15
mm in wall thickness). The stent processing flow is shown in Figure S1.

The open-cell design was used
to be common to commercial stents. The final stent samples were fully
operational on self-expansion after crimping to catheter size. The
austenite finish (Af) temperature was set to 22 ± 3 °C.
Tube B and Stent B were identical to Tube A and Stent A in sizes,
designs, and surface finishing conforming to the ASTM F86 standard.15 For each sample, all of the specimens were cut
from the same NiTi tube and were 25 mm in length and 6 mm in diameter.
Eight specimens were selected for each sample lot after quality control
of strut dimensions, uniformity, structural integrity, and surface
finishing (ASTM F8615). A thin protective
TiO2 layer (<10 nm) was formed uniformly by the electropolishing
process similar to the commercial stents.

The tube quality was
examined for chemical compositions (energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) microanalysis Princeton γ-tech PRISMIG at 15 kV),
inclusions (ASTM E124517 on FEG scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) Zeiss Leo 1530), geometry uniformity (Optical
Keyence VHX-5000), mechanical properties (uniaxial tensile test INSTRON
5966), and phase transformation temperatures (differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) Mettler Toledo DSC822e).

Seven commercial
NiTi stent samples from seven different providers
(kept anonymous in the paper) were received in the final product form.
They were produced in 2014–2016 for clinical use in European
countries. These stents were similar in dimensions (6 mm in diameter,
160–190 μm in strut thickness, 150–200 mm in length),
using common designs and ASTM F8615 surface
finishing (electropolishing without coating). All seven stents were
examined in the as-received state; micrographs are shown in the Supporting
Information, denoted S1–S7 hereafter.
The commercial samples were carefully cut into ∼25 mm long
specimens (5–8 specimens per sample) for inclusion and corrosion
studies. The Af temperature among the seven samples varied between
8.8 and 26.9 °C.

Methods of Characterization
The
ASTM E124517 practice was used to quantify
the nonmetallic
inclusions with backscatter electron imaging (BSI) at 1000×.
The inclusion area fraction, size, and density were quantified by
image analysis using ImageJ.18 Inclusion
compositions were characterized by EDX spectroscopy in mapping and
spot modes. Eighty random zones were imaged on each NiTi tube (mechanical
polished) and 40 random zones per stent specimen (5–8 per sample)
for inclusion quantification.

The ASTM F2129-1719 protocol and standard instruments were used for corrosion
susceptibility assessments of stent specimens. Rest potentials (Er) of the specimens were measured by suspending
the specimens in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) under open-circuit
conditions for 1 h. The potential scan started from Er toward the anodic direction at a constant rate of 1
mV/s. The scan was reversed at the predetermined vertex potential
(Ev) of 1000 mV/saturated calomel electrode
(SCE) or when the current thresholds reached two decades greater than
the current recorded at breakdown (Eb).
The mean values of Er, Eb, and Ev were reported for
each sample (5–8 tests per sample). The repeatability of this
study was comparable to the E691 reference studies for the F2129 standard.19 After the electrochemical tests, the samples
were cleaned with distilled water and ethanol for postcorrosion SEM
analysis.

Results and Discussion
Quantification and Microanalysis
of Nonmetallic Inclusions
The inclusions in the minitubes
generally resulted from the raw
ingot impurities; then, subsequent inclusion-related defects were
due to the microextrusion process. These inclusions were distributed
homogeneously in the specimens. Micrographs of the tubes and stent
samples are shown in Figure 1. The inclusions and microstructural defects of the two NiTi
tubes (Tubes A and B) were compared; two example images are shown
in Figure 1a. Similar
stringlike defects (composed of inclusion fragments and voids) and
inclusions could be seen on the outer surfaces (the surface that is
not affected by the laser cutting process). These defects were due
to the microextrusion process, during which the inclusions rotated
and fragmented in traces along the tubing axis. As a result, these
strings were always parallel to each other. Most of the inclusions
were accompanied by tubing strings longer in the case of Ti2NiOx fragments (could reach 10 μm)
and shorter in the case of TiC (about several microns).

Figure 1 (a) SEM micrographs
of the outer surfaces of tubes A and B after
mechanical polishing; (b) SEM micrographs of the inclusions on Stents
A and B (BSI: backscatter imaging; SEI: secondary electron imaging).

On quantification, Tube A presented an inclusion
fraction around
0.1 area% and Tube B presented 0.5 area% (Figure 1a). The two tubes were compliant with the
ELI grade. The stent samples fabricated from the two tubes inherited
the inclusions and defects from the microtubes. The laser-cut process
generated new surfaces in the thickness of the strut. These new surfaces
were defaulted with prior internal inclusions of the microtube, cutting
the stringlike defects in a nonparallel direction (Figure 1b). As a result, additional
inclusions and defects in the tube volume could be exposed on the
laser-cut surfaces. The defects in the form of holes could be produced
when the laser-cut surfaces intersected inclusion strings (as shown
on Stent B in Figure 1b). Therefore, the density of holes was associated with the inclusion
fractions, i.e., no hole was observed on Stent A (inclu.% = 0.1%),
whereas few holes were observed on Stent B (inclu.% = 0.5%). It is
worth noting that the electropolishing process (ASTM F8615) is not able to eliminate either the inclusions
or the associated holes induced by inclusions.

One sample of
Tube B is presented in Figure 2 to show the results of the quantification
and microanalysis of the inclusions conforming to the ASTM E124517 standard. Figure 2a presents the BSI micrograph on the polished surface,
on which the inclusions and defects stood out due to the contrast
of the material density, i.e., the inclusions (oxides and carbides)
and voids were less dense than the NiTi matrix. The total area fraction
of the inclusions (and voids) at the imaged area was 0.5%. Image posttreatment
(by ImageJ18) could then isolate the inclusions
for statistics. EDX microanalysis results (Figure 2b) showed the differences between the two
types of inclusions, oxide (Ti2NiOx) and carbide (TiC), using element mapping and quantitative spectroscopy.
It can be noticed that the oxide inclusion was broken into continuous
fragments and voids in a string, whereas the carbides were still in
one piece with small voids.

Corrosion Susceptibility of All Samples
Corrosion susceptibility
assessments (F2129-1719) were repeated
on the eight specimens of Stents A and B, respectively. Figure 3 presents two typical examples
of the cyclic polarization curves (ASTM F212919) of Stent A (inclu.% = 0.1%) and Stent B (inclu.% = 0.5%). No breakdown
occurred on any of the Stent A specimens before reaching the vertex
potential (Ev = 1000 mV). However, breakdown
(Eb) occurred on Stent B in a reproducible
manner on all eight specimens at about 600 mV during positive scanning.

Figure 3 Cyclic
polarization curves of one specimen of Stent A (inclu.%
= 0.1%) and one specimen of Stent B (inclu.% = 0.5%).

The above results demonstrated a clear dependence between
the inclusion
density and corrosion resistance in the model stents. It can be noticed
that even in the ELI range, the corrosion resistance may be strongly
impacted by the inclusion-related defects. To confirm the established
dependence, a study on inclusions and corrosion resistance was then
performed on seven different commercial stent samples from different
providers (the same surface finishing as the model stents, shown in Figure S2). The summary statistical results from
the 5–8 specimens of each sample are shown in Figure 4 (4a for inclusion, 4b for
corrosion). It can be noticed that the samples were all of ELI grade
but the inclusion fractions of different samples showed large differences
from 0.03% (S5) to 0.72% (S3). Several points are also worth mentioning:
(a) compared to Tubes A and B, Stents A and B seemed to present a
slight reduction of inclusion fractions, but the differences were
in the magnitude of measurement error; (b) the inclusions could be
present as a single type (oxides or carbides) or mixed types; and
(c) in the samples with mixed inclusions, the ratios between oxide
and carbide were also different from one another.

fractions and breakdown potentials (Eb) of the samples (tubes A and B, Stents A and
B, and seven commercial stents S1–S7). (a) Total inclusion
fraction, Ti2NiOx fraction

and Ev, green). (c) Plot correlating the
total inclusion fractions (y-axis) to breakdown potentials
(x-axis) of the samples that exhibited breakdown
during polarization tests (marked by squares; Stent B is highlighted
in red). Stent A is highlighted in red, and the samples without breakdown
are plotted at the bottom right corner beyond Ev (1000 mV) and marked by circles.

Figure 4b summarizes
the results of F212919 assessments of all
of the stent samples. The standard deviations of the measurements
of the stent samples were close to the ASTM (the first two columns)
studies.19 The correlative plotting between
the inclusion fractions and the breakdown potentials is shown in Figure 4c. It can be noticed
that the correlation between the inclusion fraction and Eb seems to be almost linear in the ELI range. A linear
fit (R2 = 0.81) was roughly associated
with the inclu.% vs Eb in the range 400
mV < Eb < 800 mV. In a recent study,
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported that the F2129
safety acceptance was Eb ≥ 600
mV for NiTi stents in an in vivo environment for 6 months postimplantation
without pitting corrosion risk.20 So, the
shadow square (in the background) indicates the in vivo safety area
by considering this criterion. Regarding this FDA acceptance based
on Rosenbloom and Corbett,21 samples including
S2, S3, and Stent B could be risky with respect to pitting corrosion
during the first 6 months after stent implantation.

Investigation
of Pitting Damages Initiated at the Defects (Inclusions
and Holes)
A summary of the inclusion-related corrosion damages
after F212919 assessments (of all of the
stent samples) is shown in Figure 5. The corrosion sites were especially observed to investigate
the responses of inclusions to the potentiodynamic polarization.

Figure 5 Summary
of typical inclusions and related defects observed in all
of the samples in localized pitting corrosion processes during polarization:
(a, b) behaviors of Ti2NiOx strings; (c, d) behaviors of TiC inclusions; (e, f) behaviors of
neighboring Ti2NiOx strings
and TiC inclusions; (g) surface without inclusions; and (h) fracture
surface of a strut losing integrity.

In the cases of the Ti2NiOx string (as shown in Figure 5a,b), the pitting corrosion could probably initiate at the
voids of the string and penetrated into the NiTi matrix, causing alloy
dissolution in the corrosion pits. The oxide particles/interfaces
seemed to be less involved in the corrosion process (intact until
the collapse of the strut surface, as shown in Figure 5b). In the cases of TiC (Figure 5c), both the interfaces (TiC/NiTi)
and voids were active with respect to the pitting process, finished
by forming an open pitting hole (Figure 5d), where the TiC inclusion remained at the
bottom of the cavity. It is worth mentioning that in Figure 5d, a TiC inclusion could be
seen on the pit wall. It was an inclusion beneath the strut surface
but exposed to an electrolyte due to the coarsening of the corrosion
pit. It could probably be able to further enhance the pitting process.
In the cases of adjacent Ti2NiOx and TiC (Figure 5e,f), corrosion could probably occur simultaneously at the voids
and the TiC interfaces, developing to a pitting site as observed in Figure 5f. In the cases of
an inclusion-free surface (Figure 5g from sample S5), no pitting was observed, with only
a slight increase of the surface roughness when compared to the surface
before the corrosion test (Figure S2e).
Moreover, Figure 5h
presents a typical corrosion pit surface, on which inclusions and
structural defects in the strut volume were revealed.

Postcorrosion
investigations were also dedicated to the holes on
the laser-cut surfaces. Figure 6 presents the comparison before (Figure 6a,b) and after corrosion (Figure 6c,d) at the same location.
The holes at the bottom of the U-shaped strut initiated the pitting
corrosion. Thus, the strut could probably be corroded simultaneously
from both the outer surface and laser-cut surfaces, on which the holes
could act as confined crevices for corrosion. The micrographs after
corrosion tests of all of the commercial stent samples are shown in Figure S3.

S3 from the defects
of holes: (a, b) surface finishing and defects before polarization
tests; (c, d) specimen corroded at inclusion holes during the polarization
tests.

The above results could indicate
correlations between corrosion
resistance and inclusions in NiTi stents. The differences in inclusion
types and fractions could have been induced by raw materials from
different suppliers using different elaboration techniques. In the
previous studies, the oxide and carbide inclusions had been suggested
to be almost neutral to corrosion resistance on annealed ingots without
deformation.12 Indeed, the electrochemistry
nature of the Ti2NiOx was supposed
to be similar to the TiO2,12,1312,13 and TiC particles were, even cathodic to NiTi matrix,14 but not enough in cathode/anode surface ratio
to trigger the pitting corrosion via galvanic-like coupling. Nevertheless,
the situation could be different when considering the structural defects
related to Ti2NiOx after tubing
deformation. The oxides could break into fragments and rotate in distance
by leaving strings and voids. As a consequence, the size of the inclusion
reduced but the length of the inclusion strings increased. As observed
in this study, the length of the strings could reach several tens
of microns (the strut thickness was 160–190 μm). After
tube drawing, the original crystallographic interfaces (created by
a diffusion- or interface-controlled precipitation process22) between the inclusion and the NiTi matrix were
destroyed. From the observations on Ti2NiOx strings (Figure 5a,b,e), the oxide interfaces showed good resistance
to corrosion as suggested in the literature12 but the voids seemed very active to initiate pitting. It could be
suggested that the voids in the strings served as crevices for corrosion
in a confined space, where a small volume of the corrosive solution
became stagnant, leading to oxygen depletion and eventually a halt
in the oxygen reduction necessary for repassivation.23 Moreover, a similar situation could be assumed for the
holes on the laser-cut surfaces. The corrosion mechanisms of the two
inclusion types could be very different: (a) Ti2NiOx-induced corrosion initiated on Ti2NiOx-associated defects, i.e., string
voids and holes, while the interface between oxide and the NiTi matrix
seemed to be inert; (b) TiC-induced corrosion initiated on both TiC/NiTi
interfaces and TiC-associated defects. It may be suggested that, at
the same area fraction, TiC inclusions could be more efficient than
Ti2NiOx regarding the initiation
of pitting corrosion.

The inclusion size and density were important
characteristics for
a given inclusion fraction. The role of inclusion size in corrosion
susceptibility has been reported, showing that the corrosion resistance
increased as the size decreased from 15 to 8 μm.14 Then, the resistance started to decrease when
the inclusion size became smaller than 8 μm.14 To clarify the inclusion size effect in that range (about
1–6 μm in stents), breakdown potentials measured in this
study were plotted as a function of inclusion size (Figure 7). It was found that the breakdown
potentials showed an always-negative dependence on the inclusion size
but the slope of the negative dependence was clearly related to the
inclusion density. Several iso-density lines are drawn in Figure 7 (red dashed lines
for ≤1600, ∼2200, and ∼3200 mm–2). The slopes increased when the densities increased from 1600 to
3200 mm–2. It would be reasonable to explain this
density dependence by the fact that the total interface areas of the
inclusions and inclusion-induced defects rapidly increased with density.

Figure 7 Plot of
breakdown potentials in correlation to average inclusion
sizes and inclusion densities. Red dashed lines represent the iso-density
for ≤1600, ∼2200, and ∼3200 mm–2. The shadow square indicates the in vivo safety area (Eb ≥ 600 mV).

Conclusions
In this study, the electrochemical breakdown
potentials (Eb) were assessed on ELI stent
samples (inclusion
fraction <1 area %). Two groups of samples are studied in comparison:
the first group contains stent samples fabricated in the laboratory
using two different NiTi tubes on inclusion fractions; the second
group is composed of seven commercial stents with the same surface
finishing. The results presented a noteworthy correlation between
the nonmetallic inclusion fractions and the electrochemical breakdown
potentials in the extra low inclusion range. A negative dependence
was observed between the breakdown potentials and the inclusion fractions
in the ELI stents (inclu.% = 0.2–0.8%), in which the breakdown
potentials were found to be inversely proportional to inclusion fractions
and densities (Eb decreased from ∼800
to ∼400 mV). No breakdown occurred on the samples using high-purity
NiTi materials (inclu.% < 0.1%). The microstructural evidence showed
that the effectiveness of TiC and that of Ti2NiOx was very different in the pitting process.
The maximum inclu.% ≤ 0.9% was found to obtain Eb ≥ 600 mV, the FDA’s in vivo safety acceptance
(low risk up to 6 months postimplantation). The high-purity stents
did not exhibit corrosion susceptibility until 1000 mV, suggesting
superior corrosion resistance and thus long-term in vivo safety.
