The preparation of natural rubber
(NR)–silica
(SiO2) elastomeric composites with excellent mechanical
properties along with better self-healing ability remains a key challenge.
Inspired by the energy dissipation and repairability of sacrificial
bonds in biomaterials, a strategy for combining covalent and noncovalent
sacrificial networks is engineered to construct a dual hybrid network.
Here, the approach used to fabricate the composites was self-assembly
of NR, bearing proteins and phospholipids on its outer bioshell, with
SiO2 via metal-ion-mediated heteroaggregation effected
by reversible electrostatic and H-bonds. Further, covalent cross-links
were incorporated by a silane coupling agent, bis [3-(triethoxysilyl)
propyl] tetrasulfide. The intrinsic self-healing ability of the composite
at the molecular level was studied by broadband dielectric spectroscopy
that unraveled the mechanism of the healing process. The synergistic
effect between the molecular interdiffusion of the cross-linked NR
chains and the electrostatic and H-bonding interactions
imparted an exceptional self-healing characteristic to the liquid–liquid-mixing-prepared
NR–SiO2 composites with improved mechanical performance.
Specifically, the segmental relaxation dynamics of the healed composite
was largely restricted due to increased number of ion–dipole
interactions and S–S cross-links at the junction of the cut
surface. We envisage that this extraordinary healing property, unreported
yet, would be of great importance toward the design of novel NR–SiO2 elastomeric hybrids with superior mechanical properties.

1 Introduction
Reinforcement
of polymers by fillers such as carbon black (CB) and
silica (SiO2) is vital because almost all kinds
of neat rubber suffer from poor mechanical strength.1−6 CB as a versatile
reinforcing filler has greatly enhanced the dynamic and mechanical
properties of elastomeric composites.7−11 However, the source of CB is petroleum-based, whereas the fossil
reserve is inadequate. Moreover, CB generates numerous pollutants,
thereby triggering serious ecological hazards.12 SiO2, which is independent of oil resource,
has gained importance in the manufacture of “green tires”,
as it offers significant advantages over CB in terms of low rolling
resistance and significantly improved performance of the tire tread
component.13−15 However, the
silanol groups on the SiO2 surface, the poor dispersion
of polar SiO2 in the nonpolar rubber, and weak polymer–filler
interactions pose persistent complications for the use of SiO2 in the tire industry. To maximize the usage of SiO2 in rubber composites, especially in tires, exhaustive efforts have
been focused on the techniques to combine SiO2 and polymers
into a nanocomposite. Strategies such as shear mixing, surface modification
of SiO2, and adsorption of dispersants on the filler surface
have been validated to be effective in improving the dispersion of
SiO2.16−22 For instance, sulfide-containing
silanes, such as [3-(triethoxysilyl) propyl] tetrasulfide (TESPT),
have been commonly used in the tire industry.23 The formation of an interphase in the composite has been influenced
by the accessibility of filler surfaces, determined by the dispersion
state of the filler in the polymer matrix.24−27 Consequently,
the ultimate performance of elastomeric composites has been determined
by the dispersion state of the filler and the polymer–filler
interactions, effectively enhancing their mechanical strength. However,
the crack propagation in elastomeric products during the service period
has led to mechanical failures. Thus, self-healing rubbers have been
developed and have attracted significant attention in the recent years
to address this problem.28−37 A sacrificial network has been seen to be a vital factor in determining
such properties in biological materials, such as spider silk, mussel,
and bones.38,39 Accordingly, sacrificial bonds
have been
assimilated into rubbers by various authors40−45 for imparting super
strength and self-healing. Specifically, noncovalent interactions,
such as H-bonding, metal–ligand coordination, and π–π
stacking, and hydrophobic interactions have been exploited to construct
such supramolecular assemblies so that they break first upon being
damaged and re-form after application of external stimuli. However,
compared to the strong covalent bonds, the weak noncovalent bonds
are generally stimuli-responsive and exhibit a reversible association–dissociation
mechanism on exposure to the external stimulus. Consequently, such
reversible behavior bestows the supramolecular composites with ensured
self-healing capability but results
in poor mechanical performance. Even though silica technology is effectively
being practiced in tire industries,46−48 the above discussed
problems are still encountered
while using silica as fillers especially in NR. Therefore, the fabrication
of an elastomeric composite with excellent mechanical and self-healing
properties remains a crucial task for engineering high-performance
composites.

Inspired by the energy dissipation mechanism and
the reparability of sacrificial bonds, we engineered here a dual hybrid
network to exploit the contribution of sacrificial and covalent bonds
in enhancing self-healing and mechanical performance of the composite
simultaneously. Here, we first incorporated weaker electrostatic and
H-bonds via metal-ion-mediated heteroaggregation between NR (bearing
proteins and phospholipids) and SiO2.49 Further, stronger covalent bonds were established via the
bis [3-(triethoxysilyl) propyl] tetrasulfide (TESPT) silane coupling
agent. This approach resolved two fundamental issues discussed above:
(i) first, it allowed us to improve the dispersion of SiO2 particles in the NR matrix by avoiding their random aggregation
and (ii) it enabled the incorporation of reversible sacrificial bonds.
However, these kinds of ionic cross-links have not yet been realized
in self-healing composites. For example, an epoxy-functionalized NR
with low degree of cross-links has been reported to display self-healing
ability at higher temperature via interdiffusion of NR chains along
with stronger epoxy interactions. Differing from the previous reports,50,51 we effectively synthesized NR–SiO2 composites
via Mg2+-induced heteroaggregation to produce a reversible
supramolecular network mainly constructed by ion–dipole, electrostatic,
and H-bonding interactions at room temperature. Further, the covalent
network between SiO2 and NR was established by adding TESPT
to the resultant composite. As anticipated, this supramolecular network
imparted an exceptional self-healing characteristic to the NR with
simultaneously improved mechanical performance than that of the conventionally
prepared composites. Scheme 1 depicts the sequence of events leading to the desired cross-linked
network of the composite.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Key Strategy
in the Making of NR–SiO2 Composites
The
essential feature of our approach in the fabrication of self-healing
and high-mechanical-strength composites was to introduce H-bonds and
ionic cross-links between NR and SiO2 prior to covalent
bond formation. Our strategy was based on a controlled metal-ion-induced
heteroaggregation that allowed generation of massive ion–dipole
and H-bond cross-links. The proteins of NR could be ionized in three
different ways depending on the pH of the system (Scheme 2). At a pH less than the isoelectric
point (4.5–5.0), the NR particles are positively charged and
remain neutral at isoelectric conditions.

Scheme 2 Effect of pH on the
Net Charge on the Linked
Protein (P) Component of NR
At a basic pH (pH
∼ 10) higher than the isoelectric point, acidic ionization
takes place and NR particles would thus be negatively charged. Besides,
lipid molecules in natural rubber carry permanent negative charge.
Therefore, the electrostatic forces exerted by Mg2+ ions
in a binary suspension of repulsive charged colloids of NR and SiO2 particles would drive the mutual assembly via reversible
electrostatic and H-bonds. Simultaneously, the buffering ability of
the amino acid on NR would trigger self-assembly of SiO2 by preventing their random aggregation. Thus, the resultant composites
were stabilized via the formation of supramolecular networks, initiated
from ion–dipole and H-bonding interactions, as confirmed by
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis (Figure S1, Supporting Information (SI)). For specific nomenclature
of the composites, for example NR/50S-T, etc., refer to the Experimental
Section.

2.2 Molecular
Dynamics in NR and NR–SiO2 Composites
2.2.1 Segmental Dynamics in NR–SiO2 Composites as
Revealed by Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy
(BDS)
Natural rubber comprises low-polarity cis-polyisoprene
chains. Because of the asymmetry in its molecular structure, NR has
components of dipole moment both parallel and perpendicular to the
chain contour and therefore exhibits two relaxation modes: (i) a segmental
mode at temperatures above the glass-transition temperature (Tg ∼ −65 °C) with its origin
in local motions of the perpendicular dipole moment component of the
segmental NR chain motion and (ii) a dielectric normal mode caused
by the parallel dipole moment component along the chain contour at
temperatures well beyond Tg.52−54 It has been reported that the
presence of cross-links slows down the segmental dynamics of polymer
chains and lowers the frequency shift of the segmental mode due to
the formation of polar functionalities such as (i) mono, di, or polysulfide
cross-links, (ii) carbonyl groups, and (iii) S–C bonds in vulcanized
composites.55−58 Therefore, cross-linking of NR with sulfur
and TESPT will increase the total number of polar groups, which restricts
the mobility of polymer chains and would cause the segmental mode
to shift toward lower frequencies. As shown in Figure 1a, the molecular mobility of the polymer
segments in pristine NR is influenced by the presence of filler and
by cross-linking, with the position of the maxima shifting to lower
frequencies in both the composites. However, it is interesting to
note that the lower frequency shifts in NR/50S-T are much more predominant
compared with DNR/50S-T. Such a variation in the NR chain dynamics
could be attributed to enhanced dipolar interactions caused by Mg2+ present in NR50S-T that had strongly restricted the segmental
dynamics of the neighboring NR chains in the composite. In essence,
Mg2+ established a molecular bridge (salt bridge) that
clamped the negatively charged NR and SiO2 colloidal particles
and formed a supramolecular network in the composite. These structural
developments contributed to the overall cross-linked network, serving
as a new kind of ionic cross-linker along with the disulfide (S–S)
cross-links. Such a network structure was missing in DNR/50S-T that
was fabricated using a dry mixing procedure. Consequently, the cross-linking
of NR chains in NR/50S-T could effectively take place with increasing
number of dipoles involved in the segmental relaxation process, causing
the segmental mode to shift to lower frequencies. The presence of
disulfide and C–S cross-links was further confirmed by Raman
spectra, vide Figure 1b. Prominent Raman bands at around 500 and 700 cm–1 appeared due to S–S and C–S linkages in the composite.59 The more predominant S–S and C–S
peak intensities in NR/50S-T, compared to the other composite, implied
an increased fraction of disulfide bonds created between the NR chains,
in accordance with the bound rubber content, as discussed in Section 2.3.

2.2.2 Molecular
Dipole Oscillations
in Natural Rubber (NR)
Molecular oscillation
of dipoles that are related to the molecular mobility of side groups,
segments, or whole polymer chains undergoes different relaxation processes,
which can be studied experimentally via BDS. However, molecular-level
understanding is necessary to probe the mechanism of such dipole oscillations
and their response to the applied electric field. Consequently, molecular
mechanics (MM+) simulations were performed to shed light on the oscillation
of molecular dipoles under an external electric field. The molecular
structure for NR was modeled via MM+ simulations, where the main approach
was to obtain the minimum-energy configuration of the potential energy
surface of the studied molecular system using equations of classical
mechanics that describe the structure and physical properties of molecules.
The representative model is shown in Figure 2, depicting the orientation of the molecular
dipole moment perpendicular to the chain contour (segmental mode)
adopted from our previous studies.49

structure of natural rubber (NR) with five repeating isoprene chains
bifunctionalized with lysine and phospholipids.

To study the effect of applied electric filed on the oscillation
of molecular dipoles, an electric field interaction term was introduced
into the Hamiltonian of the modeled NR system and the corresponding
equations were solved numerically. The dipolar oscillation in NR was
calculated using a consequential set-by-step procedure with varying
electric field, using single-point calculations. Figure 3a presents the possible orientation
of molecular dipoles in the model NR chain in the absence of an external
electric field (E = 0). Our calculation shows that
the total dipole moment (μTotal = 2.132 D) of the
NR chain is oriented perpendicular to the molecular chain axis/along
the chain contour. However, interestingly, the component of the dipole
moment along the z direction, μz = 1.955 D, perpendicular to the molecular axis was
found higher than the molecular dipole in x direction,
μx = 0.177 D, parallel to the molecular
axis, with μy = 0. Therefore, as
shown in Figure 2,
NR molecular chains prefer to lie with the orientation of their dipole
perpendicular to the molecular axis in the absence of electric field
(E = 0). As discussed above, the μz and μx components
of the dipole moment for the modeled NR chain can be related to the
experimentally observed segmental and normal modes, respectively,
via BDS. As shown in Figure 3b, the application of external electric field E along the direction of average dipole moment causes reorientation
of the dipole and leads to switching of the molecular dipole at E = ∼2 MV/cm. The driving force for reorientation
could be the minimization of the total energy of the modeled NR chain
(66.79 vs 91.82 kcal/mol at E = 0, vide Figure 2), which changes
for different dipole configurations. Therefore, the mechanism of molecular
switching in the NR chain by a simple rotation of molecular dipole
along the applied electric field can also be a very useful parameter
to unravel the polymer chain dynamics near the filler surface, for
which we intended to carry out further BDS studies.

dipole orientation for

of polarization switching in the model NR chain under an electric

2.3 Characteristic Swelling Behavior
of the Composites
Bound rubber (BR) is defined as the rubber
that cannot be dissolved by a good solvent. Toluene is an excellent
solvent for NR, while it is a bad solvent for silica. Figure 4a shows the swelling behavior
of the prepared NR–SiO2 composites. In this process,
neat NR dissolved in toluene within 1 h, while NR–SiO2 composites could not be fully swollen in toluene even after 7 days.
It is obvious that the upper part of the vial is the clear toluene
phase, while the lower part is the NR–SiO2 composite.
The inclusion of SiO2 into the NR matrix could enhance
the toluene resistance of the composites, which could result from
two factors:60 (i) tortuosity effect and
(ii) decreased NR polymer free volume fraction. Further, the mesoporous
structure of silica can strongly enable the physical and mechanical
entrapment of NR chains by interlocking, thereby acting as a driving
force to improve the mechanical reinforcement. As shown in Figure 4b, the bound rubber
content of NR/50S-0T with no TESPT was the lowest due to weak physical
cross-links between SiO2 and NR. However, the BR contents
in NR/50S-T (5 phr TESPT), NR/50S-RT (R: reduced, 2.5 phr TESPT),
and DNR/50S-T (5 phr TESPT under dry condition) composites were higher
compared to those in the composite without TESPT.

NR/50S-RT, and (g) DNR/50S-T. (B) Comparison of bound rubber contents
in NR–SiO2 composites.

Addition of
TESPT (silane coupling agent) established an improved coupling between
NR and SiO2 that further cross-linked the NR chains during
vulcanization. Interestingly, the BR content of NR/50S-RT (reduced
TESPT) is almost similar to that of NR/50S-T and higher than that
of DNR/50S-T, which could be due to controlled dispersion of the filler
and enhanced reactivity of TESPT even at low levels.

2.4 Filler Networking and Mechanical
Behavior of NR–SiO2 Composites
The storage
modulus (G′) of the NR–SiO2 composites in the rubbery state can reveal the extent of SiO2–SiO2 interactions. Figure 5a clearly shows that the G′ of all of the composites decreases significantly upon increasing
strain. This phenomenon is called “Payne effect”,61 expressed by the difference between G′ values at small and large strains (ΔG′), and occurs due to breakdown of the filler network
that follows release of the trapped NR under oscillatory shear.62,63 As expected, the NR/75S-T (75 phr SiO2) and NR/25S-T
(25 phr SiO2) composites exhibited highest and lowest ΔG′ values. In the former case, the high concentration
of SiO2 particles led to a significantly higher
SiO2–SiO2 interaction than in the later.
On the other hand, the higher ΔG′ in
the case of the DNR/50S-T composite can be attributed to poor dispersion
of filler particles in the NR matrix. Here, severe agglomeration among
the filler particles even in the presence of TESPT could be observed,
as evident from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Figure S3, SI). Further, the NR/50S-T and NR/50S-RT
composites (prepared via liquid–liquid mixing) exhibited lower
magnitude (ΔG′) of Payne effect, suggesting
a more uniform dispersion of the filler and a weaker filler network
in the composites. It is in correspondence with the conclusion that
the liquid mixing approach mediated by Mg2+ ions has a
positive effect on the dispersion of silica by preventing their random
aggregation. A close correlation between the Si–O–Si
peak maximum and the Payne effect was validated via Figure S4, SI. With increasing silica loading, the SiO2–SiO2 interaction enhanced, resulting in
Si–O–Si frequency shifts to lower wavenumbers.

Figure 5 (a) Payne effect
illustrating
the filler networking in
the NR–SiO2 composites. (b) Representative stress–strain
curves of the NR–SiO2 composites depicting their
mechanical performance.

The stress–strain behavior straightly reflects the
mechanical
performance of NR–SiO2 composites. Representative
stress–strain curves for the composites are plotted in Figure 5b. The NR/50S-0T
composite has relatively poor mechanical performance with a lower
modulus (stress at 300% strain) as 6.96 MPa. Further, the elongation
at break was as high as 495% for this composite. Here, Mg2+ could only facilitate the dispersion of silica in the NR matrix
by establishing a salt bridge between NR and SiO2 colloidal
particles. In spite of this, the interfacial interaction was still
weak, as Mg2+ could not covalently bridge silica and the
NR chains. The remarkable enhancement in the extensibility of the
NR/50S-0T composite is due to slippage of the entangled NR chains
that are noncovalently linked to SiO2 due to the absence
of the cross-linker (TESPT). A noteworthy scenario was that the addition
of TESPT significantly improved the modulus and tensile strength of
NR–SiO2 composites, as given in Table 1. For instance, the calculated
modulus and tensile strength of NR/50S-T of 17.55 and 18.5 MPa, respectively,
were much better than those of the DNR/50S-T composite (16.94 and
17.95 MPa, respectively). The enhanced mechanical performance of NR/50S-T
could be due to the highly controlled dispersion of silica particles
attained via liquid–liquid mixing. Simultaneously, the incorporation
of covalent cross-links between NR and SiO2 further enhanced
the filler reinforcing properties. However, such improvement in the
reinforcing effect (tensile strength) reduced the material’s
extensibility, and as a result, the stretching of NR rubber chains
that are anchored and entrapped on the SiO2 surface was
effectively arrested. Consequently, the elongation at break decreased.
Notably, the reduced elongation at break for NR/50S-T and NR/50S-RT
(312 and 345%, respectively) as compared to that for NR/50S-0T (495%
with no TESPT) indicated the NR chain extensibility to be affected
by TESPT due to strong covalent cross-links. Moreover, the increasing
amount of NR molecular domain that was trapped inside the silica pores
partially behaved like “dead” polymer and might have
increased the modulus and strength of the composite. Altogether, our
present work has the following improvements: (1) the TESPT dosage
could be significantly reduced by adopting the liquid mixing approach,
where controlled silica dispersion was attained via Mg2+ ions, following which TESPT was added, and (2) the processing and
performance characteristics became superior to those of the traditional
composite.

2.5 Monitoring
Self-Healing Characteristics of the NR–SiO2 Composites
2.5.1 Macroscale Mechanical
Testing Analysis
The self-healing behavior of NR–SiO2 composites was evaluated by cutting the sample at the middle
part using a clean surgical blade. The cut surfaces were brought together
immediately with a slight pressure to assure the docking of the cut
surfaces. The samples were allowed to heal upon heating them from
room temperature (22 °C) to 60 °C for 24 h, and the healing
performance was noted by acquiring optical micrographs of the specimen
as well as manual stretching (Figure S5, SI). Better healing was observed at 50 °C after 24 h of healing
time. According to Tee et al.,64 even though
the NR chain mobility at higher healing temperatures evidently facilitates
the healing efficiency, the extreme deterioration of electrostatic
and ion pair interactions could decline the ionic bond strength and
disturb the reconstruction ability of the supramolecular networks.65 Hence, in the present investigation, the healing
performance was evaluated at 50 °C. The healing integrity of
the composite is clearly observed in Figure 6a,b. Interestingly, the healed sample, particularly
NR/50S-T, did not fracture at the cut even by manual stretching. However,
the healing efficiency of DNR/50S-T, the covalently cross-linked composite,
was poor, as shown in Figure S6, SI. Such
a response can be attributed to the presence of sacrificial networks
in NR/50S-T that exchanged the formed ionic species near the cut surface
and reconstructed the supramolecular network during healing. Thus,
the self-healing ability of NR/50S-T was endorsed to the reversible
ionic and H-bonding interactions that increased the adhesion and repaired
the cut surfaces. The meticulous self-healing behavior at the junction
of the cut position was evaluated via optical microscopy, as shown
in Figure 6a. Even
though the crack between the two cut surfaces remained apparent, a
clear shrinkage was noticed after healing by self-fusion of the cut
surfaces. Markedly, the crack between the two cut surfaces for NR/50S-T
and NR/50S-0T composites was almost unnoticeable, confirming the effective
self-healing effect. However, the crack between the cut surfaces of
the DNR/50S-T composite could be markedly seen owing to partial healing.
The self-healing capability was also evidenced in the stress–strain
measurements of the healed samples at 50 °C for various healing
times. The tensile behavior of the original and self-healed NR/50S-T
and DNR/50S-T composites at 50 °C for 24 h exhibited best healing
efficiencies, as shown in Figure 7a,b. The stress–strain curves of healed composites
closely followed the shapes of the original composites. The area under
the curve (tensile energy) before and after healing was used to calculate
the healing performance of the composites, and the values are tabulated
in Table 2. It is worth
mentioning that the self-healing ability of the NR/50S-T composite
originated from the effective reversible ion–dipole and H-bond
sacrificial networks in addition to the S–S cross-links.

The slightly higher modulus in self-healed composites has resulted
from the labile polysulfide and disulfide bridges, allowing for the
rearrangement of the broken bonds at the healed interface, in addition
to the supramolecular network. Thus, the total number of polar groups
involved has increased during the healing reaction, thereby changing
the molecular mobility due to the reconnection of the chains. This
redistribution of the structure led to the formation of a new network
with different architectures with respect to the pristine samples.
As a result, the total cross-links across the cut surface increased
after the healing reaction. This phenomenon is further supported by
the frequency shifts in the dielectric spectra, as shown in Figure 8. Similar results
were reported by Hernández et al.55,66 in
natural rubber networks with multiple reformable bonds. Their findings
were remarkable in terms of understanding the formation of new heterogeneous
networks during the healing process, especially during the restoration
of macroscopic damages due to increased number of ion–dipole
interactions in the healed composite. Similarly, Li et al.67 demonstrated the effects of thermal aging on
the tensile behavior of natural rubber composites. Here, the observed
increase in the modulus was attributed to the increased number of
cross-links upon aging the composite. In the present case, the damaged
samples were exposed to a certain temperature for a particular time
for the healing reaction to proceed, leading to an increasing modulus.

Having determined the mechanical
performance and macroscopic healing
ability of the NR–SiO2 composites, the following
section
is devoted to unravel the mechanism of molecular processes involved
in the healing behavior by means of dielectric relaxation spectroscopy.

2.5.2 Mechanism of Self-Healing:
A Broadband Dielectric Perspective
Despite the fact that
healing of macroscopic and optically measureable damage is important,
the healing of unseen internal damage (chain scission) to the polymer
network is of equal significance. Dielectric spectroscopy is a sensitive
method for probing such multilevel molecular relaxations over a broad
frequency range of 10–1 < f (Hz)
< 107. Molecular oscillations of dipoles that are related
to the molecular mobility of side groups, segments, or whole polymer
chains, which show up as different relaxation processes, are highly
sensitive to BDS. Accordingly, the evolution of the segmental dynamics
during the healing of internal damage in the NR–SiO2 composite was studied by BDS.68−78 In this section, we do not emphasize
on the quantification of the damage and healing as such by BDS but
monitor the molecular processes and the state of the material at the
end of the healing treatment. Information on the structural state
of the material after healing was followed by taking the molecular
mobility spectrum to probe the segmental relaxation process over a
wide frequency range and at a selected temperature (T = −40 °C) for pristine NR and the composites, as shown
in Figure 8. This temperature,
just above the Tg of NR, was chosen since
the segmental relaxation was well resolved within the studied frequency
window.79Figure 8 shows the normalized dielectric loss spectra
of pristine and healed NR/50S-T (fabricated via liquid–liquid
mixing) and DNR/50S-T (prepared by the dry compounding procedure)
composites. It is interesting to note that the segmental mode of the
healed composites was shifted to lower frequencies compared with the
pristine composites. This effect was more predominant in the NR/50S-T
composite, as shown in Figure 8a, than in DNR/50-T, as shown in Figure 8b. Such a behavior can be explained by the
state of the polymer network on account of healing. Schönhals
and Schlosser80 proposed a phenomenological
model for amorphous polymers in which the shape of the dielectric
loss peak was related to the behavior at low and high frequencies,
controlled by specific inter- and intramolecular interactions, respectively.
Accordingly, the self-healing process in NR/50S-T was mainly attributed
to changes in the NR chain molecular mobility in addition to its reorganized
structure. The main contribution to the segmental dynamics came from
large-scale motions at low frequencies from the respective ion–dipole,
H-bonding, and electrostatic interactions including the S–S
cross-links. However, at higher frequencies, intrachain mobility/diffusion
contributed to the observed segmental relaxation. Scheme 3 shows the schematic depiction
of the healing process in NR/50S-T. The plausible mechanism of the
self-healing process could therefore be interdiffusion of mobile NR
chains across the boundary faces in addition to the supramolecular
networks that exchange the newly formed dangling free groups near
the cut surface within the fracture region, enabling reconstruction.

3 Conclusions
We have engineered high-mechanical-strength, yet self-healable,
dual hybrid network NR–SiO2 composites. The reversible
ionic and H-bonding supramolecular network between the NR and SiO2 facilitated the self-healing capability. The covalent cross-links,
physical entanglements, and interlocks improved the mechanical and
thermal stability of the composites. The tensile tests clearly indicated
that the composite without TESPT has self-healing ability but inferior
mechanical performance. The addition of Mg2+ could only
facilitate the dispersion of silica by disturbing the H-bonding among
silica particles, thereby establishing a molecular bridge between
NR and SiO2 via ion–dipole and H-bonding interactions.
Further, the incorporation of TESPT endowed the composites with superior
mechanical, self-healing, and processing characteristics simultaneously.
Specifically, the segmental relaxation dynamics studied via BDS unraveled
the characteristic molecular motions in the composite, leading to
the mechanism of self-healing. Collectively, the present methodology
promises (a) an improved silica dispersion in NR, (b) a greatly reduced
dosage of TESPT; (c) a possible way to save mixing energy due to easy
incorporation of SiO2, and (d) fabrication of industrially
feasible composites with superior mechanical and effective self-healing
properties and opens up a promising pathway to engineer smart multifunctional
composites with versatile functions.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Natural rubber latex (NR)
with
a total solid content of 60% was purchased from Mardec R.K. Latex,
Kerala, India. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, and silica and bis [3-(triethoxysilyl) propyl]
tetrasulfide (TESPT) were provided by MRF Ltd. All reagents were of
analytical grade and used without further purification. The solutions
used were made in non-ionic Milli-Q water with 18.2 MΩ cm resistivity.
The salt concentrations were appropriately adjusted to obtain an ionic
strength of 100 mM.

4.2 Synthesis of Self-Assembled
NR–SiO2 Composites
NR–SiO2 master batches were prepared by wet compounding
and self-assembling techniques. Briefly, SiO2 particles
of 25, 50, and 75 phr (phr = weight of filler per 100 g of NR) were
dispersed in 200 mL of Milli-Q water and sonicated for ∼10
min; subsequently, SiO2 dispersion was added to NR (100
phr) suspension followed by MgSO4 addition so as to reach
an ionic strength of 100 mM. The samples were left for 1 h at room
temperature. After removing the supernatant, the samples were dried
in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 72 h.

4.3 Preparation
of Compounded Rubber Composites
To prepare the NR–SiO2 rubber composites, NR–SiO2 master batches
were compounded with rubber ingredients with
a basic formulation as listed in Table 3 on a two-roll mill according to the processes described
in the Supporting Information. Scheme 1 collates the sequence
of processes toward the synthesis of the composites. Additionally,
composites with no TESPT and with 2.5 phr of reduced TESPT and a conventional
composite via dry mixing were also synthesized. Henceforth, the samples
are abbreviated NR/25S-T, NR/50S-T, NR/75S-T, NR/50S-0T, NR/50S-RT,
and DNR/5S0-T in further discussions.

ingredients: zinc oxide (ZnO), stearic acid (SA), TESPT (T), N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazole sulfonamide (CBS), and sulfur
(S). NR/25S-T should be read as 100 phr NR; 25 phr SiO2 in the presence of TESPT (T). NR/50S-0T is the composite without
TESPT. NR/50S-RT is the composite with reduced TESPT (T). DNR/50S-T
is the composite prepared under dry mixing.

4.4 Characterization of NR–SiO2 Composites
The surface area and porosity of the SiO2 filler were
measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique
using a Quantachrome Nova2000e series surface area analyzer. The structural
morphology of the composites was unraveled with transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) with a JEM-1010, JEOL instrument at an acceleration
voltage of 80 kV. Thin slices of the samples with a thickness of ∼120
nm were obtained by cryo-microtoming at −120 °C using
a Leica EM FC6 instrument and were transferred onto carbon-coated
copper grids. Following this, the interaction between SiO2 and NR in the nanocomposites was studied with a Spectrum Two PerkinElmer
FTIR spectrophotometer by acquiring spectra at 4 cm–1 resolutions, averaged over 32 scans. An FT-Raman spectrometer (Bruker
RAMII) working in a confocal mode, connected to a Leica microscope,
was used for the measurement of the Raman spectra. The laser beam
was focused by a 100× magnification objective of a confocal microscope.
Each spectrum was collected in the frequency range 100–3500
cm–1 over 60 s and with 10 accumulations to avoid
electronic peaks and average background. Thermogravimetric analyses
(TGA) were performed with a TGA Discovery series, TA Instruments,
New Castle, DE machine. Samples were heated over a temperature range
of 22 °C (room temperature) to 900 °C at a heating rate
of 20 °C/min under a N2 atmosphere.

4.5 Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy
(BDS)
BDS measurements were done on an α
high-resolution dielectric analyzer (Novocontrol Technologies GmbH,
Hundsangen, Germany). The complex permittivity ε*(ω) =
ε′(ω) – iε″(ω) was measured
by carrying out isothermal frequency sweeps over a wide frequency
range of 10–1 < f (Hz) < 107 (where f = ω/2π is the frequency of the applied electric
field and ω is the angular frequency). The circular-shaped samples
(pristine and healed composites) were placed in the dielectric cell
between two parallel gold-plated electrodes for measuring the permittivity.
The thickness and diameter of each sample were about 1.5 and 20 mm,
respectively. The temperature during the measurement was controlled
by a nitrogen jet; a temperature error of 0.1 K during every single
frequency sweep was observed.

Swelling study was performed as
follows: the sediments of NR and NR–SiO2 composites
were cut into small pieces and dipped in toluene for 1 week at room
temperature with 0.5 g NR content in all of the samples. To ensure
sufficient swelling, the solvent was renewed every 24 h. Optical images
of the samples at specific time intervals were taken with a camera.
The bound rubber content (BR) was measured by extracting the dissolved
NR after 7 days at room temperature. The remnant was then dried at
50 °C in a vacuum oven to a constant weight. The BR was calculated
as , where W1 is the weight of the rubber
component in the
compound and W2 and W3 are the weights of the compound before and after extraction,
respectively.

Tensile tests were conducted on a dumbbell specimen
using a Zwick/Roell-Z010 testing machine with an optical elongation
sensor at a cross-head speed rate of 200 mm/min at room temperature;
five measurements were carried out for each sample. The dynamic rheological
properties of the rubber compounds were measured by a RPA2000 rubber
processing analyzer (RPA, α Technologies Co.) with strain amplitudes
varying from 0.28 to 400%, at a frequency of 1 Hz. For self-healing
tests, dumbbell-shaped samples were cut in the middle with a surgical
blade and the two cut surfaces were brought back in contact by hand
and then allowed to heal at 50 °C. After healing for 24 h, the
samples were consequently tested on a tensile tester. Subsequently,
the healing efficiency “η” was calculated as , where Eoriginal and Ehealed correspond to the respective tensile
energy (E)
for the original and healed samples.

4.6 Computational
Methodology
Molecular simulations
were performed using MM+ molecular mechanics force field with Hyperchem
version 8.0, Hypercube Inc. Here, geometry optimization was pursued
under the Polak–Ribiere conjugate gradient method. Single-point
calculations were carried out to determine the final optimized values
of the physical properties, such as dipole moment, volume, polarizability,
etc. This procedure was repeated under every value of electric field
applied for a correlation with the results obtained from BDS.
