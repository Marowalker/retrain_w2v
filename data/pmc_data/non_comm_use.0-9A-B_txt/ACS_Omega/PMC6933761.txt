Recently, exergy analysis has attracted great attention
of the
scientific community as an attractive tool for evaluating energetic
efficiency of any process. In this work, the simulation of the amine
treatment unit in a Latin-American refinery was performed in order
to apply the exergy analysis tool to identify alternatives of improvement.
The industrial amine treatment unit was simulated using Aspen plus
software, which provided extended energy and mass balances. To calculate
irreversibilities of the process and global exergy efficiencies per
stages, the general methodological procedure of exergy analysis was
used. To this end, physical and chemical exergies were found for compounds
involved within the process. The values estimated for total irreversibilities,
exergy of utilities, and exergy of wastes in the treatment of the
sulfur-rich amine allowed us to analyze the stages that require reductions
in waste generation and utility consumption. For a processing capacity
of 72.08 t/h of rich amine, results revealed that the overall exergy
efficiency was 83.81% and the total irreversibility was 1.69 × 105 MJ/h, where 23.6% corresponds to the
total exergy by residues (3.98 × 104 MJ/h). The novel strategy to use exergy analysis for process optimization
proved to be useful to detect critical stages and prioritize actions
to improve.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, it is a key
challenge to preserve the environment while
meeting the continuously increasing global energy demands caused by
population growth.1,2 To face such challenges, it requires
approaches for minimizing energy consumption or increase overall performance
at the individual-process-plant level.3,4 The improvement
of energetic performance of processing plants such as refineries can
contribute to long-term sustainability of energy resources.5 Exergy analysis is an effective method based
on the second law of thermodynamics, which is used to systematically
locate and quantify inefficiency sources. Once the locations of the
system’s inefficiencies are identified, improvement can be
made to reduce exergy loss of the system.

Exergy accounts for
the usefulness and is mathematically defined
as the maximum amount of work that can be produced by a system as
reaching equilibrium with the environment.6,7 Many
researchers and engineers conduct exergy analysis as a method for
analyzing, designing, and improving systems and processes.5,8,9 In this work, exergy analysis
is implemented in the amine treatment unit of a refinery to increase
the energetic efficiency of the process stages and to reduce its irreversibilities.
The purpose of the amine treatment unit is the regeneration of diethanolamine
(DEA) that contains H2S and CO2,10 which are absorbed in sweetening processes.11

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Methodology
The modeling of the amine
treatment unit relied on the information gathered from previous studies
and scientific literature, as well as on the collaboration of experienced
engineers that work on this field. The simulation of the process was
performed using Aspen Plus. Substances present in the real process
were selected directly from the software database, so there was no
need to create any hypothetical compound because they were all included
in the simulator’s library. In addition, key operating parameters
required to run the simulation (e.g., inlet mass flowrate) were introduced.
The selected fluid package was Peng–Robinson–Stryjek–Vera
used to calculate thermodynamic properties of compounds involved within
the process. This thermodynamic model has been shown to give comparable
results to other methods using activity coefficients for the liquid-phase
and equations of state for the vapor phase.12

2.2 Process Simulation
The simulation
flowsheet was built, consisting of the separation equipment, adsorption
and gas stripping towers, vessels, and others, all of which were selected
from the simulator model palette to represent the actual unit in an
appropriate way. Then, all process data were entered for streams and
equipment, for example, temperature, pressure, mass or molar flowrate,
and processing capacity, among others. After running the simulation,
the software provided the extended mass and energy balances for the
entire unit including detailed process data such as mass composition
of each stream and thermodynamic properties.

2.3 Process Description
The sulfur-rich
amine is sent to a flash drum, where most of the light hydrocarbons
dragged by the amine stream are separated. This stream is put in contact
with lean amine (product of the main unit) in a flash contactor to
absorb the hydrogen sulfide that could have been flashed. The rich
amine leaving the drum passes through a series of filters to remove
impurities and light hydrocarbon particles. The resulting stream is
sent to the stripping tower to eliminate the hydrogen sulfide and
carbon dioxide by vapor heating. This column is equipped with a steam
boiler and with facilities to inject live steam directly to the tower
if necessary. A part of the lean amine leaves the bottom of the tower,
and part of the stream is recirculated to the reboiler. The rest of
the stream is cooled and leaves as the main product of the unit. The
hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide (acid gas) leave the tower from
its top, followed by cooling, and then enters into a condensate drum,
where the condensed liquids serve as the tower reflux. An ejector
drags the acid gas, which then goes into a flash drum, where some
amine in the stripping is flashed and recirculated to the initial
amine flash drum. Finally, the acid gas leaves from the drum top as
waste. Figure 1 depicts
a simplified process flow diagram. The process consists of three main
stages: flash separation, filtration, and stripping.13

Figure 1 Simplified process flow diagram of the amine treatment unit.

2.3.1 Flash Separation
In this stage,
the rich amine is fed into a flash drum, where the light hydrocarbon
vapors are separated and sent to a flash contactor. In such contactors,
vapors flow in countercurrent with lean amine (main product) in order
to absorb the largest amount of H2S in the light hydrocarbons.
The sulfuric acid leaves the system for further burning. The rich
amine leaves the bottom of the contactor and enters into the flash
drum.

2.3.2 Filtration
The filtering is carried
out by a system consisting of two mechanical filters and an activated
carbon filter. A mechanical filter is used as a preliminary stage
for the removal of impurities and other solids present in the rich
amine. The activated carbon filter removes most of the dissolved hydrocarbons
that could affect the later stages of the process. The last filter
has the objective of eliminating the remnant of activated carbon present
in the rich amine.

2.3.3 Stripping
The amine coming from
the filtration stage is preheated with the bottom stream of the stripping
tower in a heat exchanger, and then, it is sent to the tower. As a
common principle of any tower, the liquid amine descends through the
tower plates and makes contact with the vapors that ascends. Such
a contact maintains the temperature conditions required to guarantee
an optimal disposition of H2S and CO2. The tower
has facilities for the use of steam as a heating source for the reboiler
and for injecting steam to the tower if necessary.

2.4 Exergy Analysis
The exergy analysis
is a thermodynamic analysis technique based on the second law of thermodynamics,
which provides a computer-aided tool to evaluate, analyze, and compare
systems.6 In addition, the exergy analysis
methodology quantifies the global efficiency and per stages that allow
to measure how close is any process to ideality.14 The main advantages of this tool are as follows:i Address the impact of an energy resource
on the environment,

ii Effective method for the analysis and
design of energy systems

iii Meet the principles of conservation
of mass and energy along with the second law of thermodynamics

iv Allow to find the most
efficient way
to use an energy resource, determine the best locations, types, and
true magnitudes of the waste.



For an exergetic balance in the steady state, the destroyed
exergy is related to the net irreversibility of mass flow, work, and
heat transfer, given by eq 1. 1   2   3  

According to eq 2,
the exergy associated with work in a system where there is constant
volume is equal to the same work of the system. Regarding exergy by
heat transfer, this can be calculated based on the efficiency of Carnot
using eq 3.15 On the other hand, the total input of exergy
in a system is related to the inlet streams of the process and/or
industrial services required by the system as expressed in eq 4, while the total output
exergy is associated with the main product streams and/or waste streams,
as shown in eq 5. 4   5   6  

Irreversibilities in the process can
be calculated with eq 6 by subtracting the total
exergy from the products to the total input of exergy.14 Finally, the exergetic efficiency of a process
or stage can be estimated by eq 7 based on the irreversibility and the total exergy entering
into the system. The percentage of irreversibilities per each stage
(i) can be calculated by eq 8. 7   8  

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Process Simulation
The simulation
of the process was carried out through the commercial simulation software
Aspen Plus. For simplification purposes, the main sections of the
process are flash separation, filtration, preheating, stripping, top
circuit, and bottom circuit. The processing capacity was set in 72.08
t/h of rich amine, and the production rate was 67.82 t/h of the main
product (lean amine). An ideal separation vessel was used as the flash
tank (D-1). A simple solid separator was used as the mechanical filter,
and carbon filter simulation was performed using a component splitter
fractionator in order to remove some remaining hydrocarbons. Stripping
tower simulation was carried out using a refluxed absorber column
equipped with a reboiler which exchanges heat with low-pressure steam
as the heating source. The final flash tank (D-2) allows us to remove
acid gas from the amine stream. Other equipment and operations such
as recycling accessories, pumps, and utilities were used for accurate
modeling of the real amine treatment unit. Figure 2 shows the simulation flowsheet provided
by the software. In order to validate the results collected from the
process simulation, a comparison of such values was performed with
the real plant data and summarized in Table 1.

3.2 Exergy Analysis
Table 2 reports the result of the chemical,
physical, and total mass exergy of the system for each current. The
exergy balance shows that the total chemical and physical exergy of
the process was 8.58 × 106 and 7.38 × 104 MJ/h, respectively. These results were used to calculate
the exergetic parameters such as irreversibilities, exergy of wastes,
exergy of utilities, and efficiency.

3.2.1 Exergy Analysis Per Stage
Figure 3 shows the exergy
analysis from the process stages of the amine treatment unit. It was
found that exergetic efficiency of the flash, filtration, preheating,
stripping, and bottom circuit stages exceeds 90%, suggesting that
there is no high waste of heat or work during the equipment operation
in each stage. On the other hand, the section of the top circuit presents
the lowest exergetic efficiency of the system with 4.1%, which affected
the overall efficiency of the process. In addition, the highest percentages
of irreversibilities were found at the bottom circuit, stripping,
and top circuit stages with contribution to total irreversibilities
of 39, 21, and 20% respectively. These results may be associated with
heat or work loses and wastes. As shown in Figure 3, the exergy of wastes reached the highest
values in the top circuit (1.90 × 104 MJ/h), followed by the bottom circuit (1.47 × 104 MJ/h) and filtration stages (4.88 × 103 MJ/h).

amine treatment unit.

3.2.2 Global Exergy Analysis
Figure 4 shows the global
exergy analysis of the amine treatment unit. It was estimated that
the overall process efficiency is 83.81%, a high value that suggested
low process irreversibilities (1.68 × 105 MJ/h). The total exergy of wastes most contributed to total
irreversibilities corresponding to 23.6% (3.98 × 104 MJ/h). In addition, the total exergy of utilities
was calculated as 2.17 × 104 MJ/h,
which was lower than the exergy of wastes. These results allowed to
identify process improvements in order to reduce the main sources
of irreversibilities. In this sense, it is proposed to incorporate
a new process stage or redesign the top and bottom circuit stages
in order to reuse the wastes leaving the system and reduce waste generation.

4 Conclusions
In this work, an amine
treatment unit of a cracking plant from
a Latin-American refinery was simulated. The processing capacity was
72.08 t/h of rich amine in order to produce 67.82 t/h of lean amine.
The comparison of simulated and real process data allowed us to validate
the accuracy of the simulation. The exergy analysis showed a global
exergetic efficiency of 83.81% that is significantly high for any
energy-intensive process. Also, the exergy efficiency per stages was
higher than 90% in most stages, except in the top circuit with an
efficiency of 4.1%. Such a low value can be explained by the high
amount of acid gas released as waste from the process. The total process
irreversibilities were calculated in 1.68 × 105 MJ/h, while total exergy of wastes and total exergy of utilities
reached 3.98 × 104 and 2.17 × 104 MJ/h, respectively.
