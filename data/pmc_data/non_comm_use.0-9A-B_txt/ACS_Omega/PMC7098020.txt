TiO2 nanofibers were fabricated by combination of sol–gel
and electrospinning techniques. Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers
with different Ag contents were prepared by two different methods
(in situ electrospinning or wetness impregnation
of Ag on TiO2 nanofibers) and heat treated at 500 °C
for 2 h under an air or N2 atmosphere. The obtained catalysts
were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy,
X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence, and N2 adsorption
analyzed by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.
Photocatalytic glucose conversions with electrospun TiO2 and Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers for production of high-value
products were carried out. From different doping methods, the results
indicated that 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers prepared by an in situ method with calcination under N2 achieved
the highest glucose conversion (85.49%). From several Ag loading contents
(i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 4 wt %) in Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers,
the nanofibers exhibited different glucose conversions [in order of
2 wt % (99.65%) > 1 wt % (85.49%) > 4 wt % (77.72%) > 0 wt
% (29.64%)]. Arabinose, xylitol, gluconic acid, and formic acid were
found as the high-value chemicals with the photocatalytic reaction
of TiO2 and Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers under UVA
irradiation. Product yields of each converted chemicals from different
photocatalysts from different Ag loading contents showed relatively
same trends with the glucose conversion. From all results, it can
be concluded that the good characteristics of 2 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers such as the smallest anatase crystallite size (8.25 nm)
and the highest specific surface area (SBET = 53.69 m2/g) promoted the highest photocatalytic activity.
Additionally, TiO2 and Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers
exhibited higher photocatalytic performance for glucose conversion
than commercial TiO2 (P25) and synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles. Finally, Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers showed
recycling ability with high photocatalytic glucose conversion after
four-time use.

Introduction
Biomass is one of important
feedstock for various utilizations instead of fossil fuels. Normally,
biomass has been converted into fuels and chemicals using various
technologies, such as steam gasification,1 fast pyrolysis,2 and supercritical conversion.3 These processes, however, have limitations such
as requiring high temperature, high pressure, high-energy consumption,
and high system cost to produce chemicals and fuels. Moreover, there
are many steps to produce chemicals in these processes. Alternative
processes that can solve these limitations and produce chemicals in
one step should be developed. In this sense, photocatalysis is one
of the most promising technologies because it represents an easy way
to utilize the energy from UV lamps or natural sunlight by catalysis
at room temperature and mild conditions.4

Photocatalysis is the acceleration of a photoreaction due
to the presence of a catalyst.5 Recently,
photocatalysis is one of technologies that have been used in environmental
and energy fields, such as degradation of organic compounds in wastewater,6 air purification,7 and water splitting.8 Titanium dioxide
(TiO2) is a white solid inorganic substance that occurs
naturally in several kinds of rock and mineral sands. There are three
different crystalline modifications, i.e., anatase, rutile, and brookite.
It is a semiconducting material that can be chemically activated by
light with a band gap energy (Eg) of about
3.2 eV.9 It is the most important photocatalyst
for many applications because TiO2 is a nontoxic, cheap,
and versatile material with attractive applications not only in photocatalysis
but also in the production of electrodes, capacitors, and solar cells.
TiO2 has various structures, such as nanoparticles, nanosheets,
nanowires, nanotubes, and nanofibers.10

Nanofibers are one-dimensional nanostructures with diameters
ranging from 10 to 100 nm with aspect ratios larger than 1000. The
TiO2 nanofiber is an outstanding form because it can solve
some limitations of TiO2, for example, reduction of TiO2 agglomeration and low interfacial charge transfer. Moreover,
it was reported that TiO2 nanofibers could perform much
better than the nanoparticles in various applications, such as photodegradation11 and hydrogen production.12

Electrospinning or electrostatic spinning is a basic
method to produce nanofibers with extreme lengths and high ratios
of surface area to volume through a process using a high-voltage electric
field.13 There are many advantages of electrospinning
such as low cost, simplicity, and high reproducibility.14 Electrospinning has been first reported by Rayleigh
in 1897 and then was developed as a patent in 1934 by Formhals.15 It was described in the patent the experimental
setup for the production of polymer filaments using electrostatic
force. Since then, this technique has received much attention. Li et al.16 synthesized TiO2 nanofibers by electrospinning a TiO2 precursor
with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) at different solution concentrations.
They found that the ultrafine nanofibers were obtained at high viscosity.
Li et al.17 synthesized
mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers via electrospinning and studied
the effect of the calcination process on the activity of TiO2 in a photocatalytic application. They found that the TiO2 nanofibers obtained at 500 °C presented the best photocatalytic
activity.

Recently, TiO2 nanofibers were modified
by several dopants, e.g., metals, for lower band gap and lower electron–hole
recombination rate than pristine TiO2.18 Inexpensive metals, e.g., silver (Ag), have been of great
interest to be used in modification of TiO2 because they
could decrease recombination of electron (e–)–hole
(h+) pairs by acting as an electron sink.19 In addition, Ag has the ability to generate surface plasmon
resonance with TiO2 by visible light.20 This causes Ag to enhance the performance of photocatalytic
activity of TiO2 and quantum yield of photocatalytic processes.

TiO2 nanofibers are widely used in various applications
such as solar cells,21 sensors,22 and photocatalysts.23 Photocatalysis has important functions in disinfection, air cleaning,24 and water treatment applications.9 However, there is no report about utilization
of TiO2 nanofibers in glucose conversion. In this work,
we report, for the first time, applications of TiO2 nanofibers
for glucose conversion by photocatalysis.

Glucose is a monosaccharide
that is attractive as a feedstock for producing value-added chemicals
such as gluconic and glucaric acids.25 Photocatalytic
conversion of glucose first drew great attention to produce hydrogen
(H2).26 After that, some works
were focused in the liquid-phase products and some value-added chemicals
were found in that phase.27,28 Colmenares et al.27 reported photocatalytic
conversion of glucose using TiO2 as a photocatalyst. Gluconic
acid, glucaric acid, and arabitol were found as the main products
after the reaction. The highest selectivity of products (70%) was
achieved in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and water.27 Recently, Payormhom et al.28 first reported that, in addition to the reported
chemicals, xylitol was also found as a product after the photocatalytic
conversion of glucose. Moreover, increasing the surface area of TiO2 was found to increase the glucose conversion and product
yields.28 In this sense, it is interesting
to use the unique properties of nanofibers for enhancement of photocatalytic
activity in glucose conversion. Therefore, TiO2 nanofibers
were fabricated in this work by combination of sol–gel and
electrospinning followed by calcination. Effects of several conditions
in modifications of TiO2 photocatalysts by Ag doping, i.e.,
preparation methods (in situ and wetness impregnation),
atmospheres during calcination (air and N2), and contents
of Ag, were studied. Photocatalytic activities of the obtained photocatalysts
in the conversion processes of glucose to high-value products were
studied.

Results and Discussion
Variation of Photocatalyst Preparation Techniques
TiO2 nanofibers were fabricated by combination of sol–gel
and electrospinning methods. The TiO2 nanofibers were then
doped by Ag. Calcination conditions (i.e., under air and N2 atmospheres) and methods of Ag doping (i.e., in situ and wetness impregnation methods) were studied. As-spun TiO2/PVP nanofibers have a smooth surface with an average diameter
of 320 nm (not shown here). Figure 1 shows the SEM images of pristine TiO2 nanofibers
calcined under the air condition and 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers
calcined under different atmospheres. The average diameter of calcined
pristine TiO2 nanofibers (280 nm) was smaller than that
of as-spun TiO2/PVP nanofibers because the polymer and
organic components were decomposed at high temperature.16Figure 1A shows the nanofibrils along the electrospun TiO2 nanofibers. This morphology is due to the sol–gel transformation
reaction during the spinning.29 The spinning
solution contains the TiO2 sol with methanol in polymer
solution before spinning, and the TiO2 sol is rapidly converted
to the TiO2 gel. Therefore, liquid–liquid phase
separation results in TiO2-rich and PVP-rich phases. These
separated phases cause formation of nanofibils.29 For different calcination conditions (i.e., under air and
N2 atmospheres), as shown in Figure 1B,C, it was found that Ag-TiO2 nanofibers calcined under air showed similar morphologywith pristine
TiO2 nanofibers (average diameter, ∼220 nm), while
Ag-TiO2 nanofibers prepared by in situ technique and calcined under an N2 atmosphere have a
rough surface (average diameter, ∼150 nm). Comparing methods
of Ag doping (i.e., in situ and wetness impregnation),
it was found that in situ electrospinning changed
greatly the morphology of the obtained fibers, while wetness impregnation
did not (average diameter, ∼250 nm) (see Figure 1C,D). This is because the nature of wetness
impregnation in which a metal solution is dropped on the calcined
TiO2 nanofibers and the obtained nanofibers are then sintered..

1 wt % Ag-TiO2 (prepared by the in situ technique) calcined under an N2 atmosphere, and (D) 1

calcined under an N2 atmosphere. Numbers 1 and 2 refer
to image magnifications of 50k (scale bar = 1 μm) and 100k (scale
bar = 500 nm), respectively.

Among all catalysts, the average diameters of all 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers were smaller than those of the pristine one due
to Ag causing the phase transition of TiO2 and reducing
the size of crystals,30 as shown in Table 1. The metal content
on TiO2 nanofibers was determined by energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectrometry. It was found that the metal content in 1
wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers fabricated by the in situ technique was significantly higher than those fabricated by wetness
impregnation (see Table 1). This is because wetness impregnation is the method wherein the
support makes contact with the solution of the metal precursor, so
the maximum load depends on the ability of the support to have ion
exchange with the metal.31 In this sense,
Ag in the fibers from the in situ method were lost
less during the synthesis process.

XRD patterns of TiO2 nanofibers and 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers (Ag was loaded by the in situ or wetness impregnation technique) under different atmospheres are
shown in Figure 2.
All catalysts show diffraction peaks of anatase at 25.4°, 38.5°,
48.0°, 54.9°, 70.2°, and 75.0°. Meanwhile, the
peaks located at 27.5°, 36.1°, 41.3°, and 56.6°
determine the (110), (101), (111), and (220) planes, respectively,
of the rutile phase.32 Even though Ag was
detected by EDX, there is no diffraction peak of Ag observed in the
XRD patterns due to its existence as small crystals whose sizes are
below the resolution limit of the technique. By comparing the in situ preparation technique with the wetness impregnation
method, the results of 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 prepared by wetness
impregnation showed a high anatase phase. In addition, the crystallite
size of catalysts prepared by wetness impregnation (17.06 nm) was
found to be larger than those of pristine TiO2 nanofibers
(14.03 nm) and the fibers prepared by the in situ method (9.54 nm). This is because heat supplied during the Ag loading
process in wetness impregnation promoted higher densities of defects
on the anatase grains resulting in larger anatase grains.33 By comparing the TiO2 nanofibers
with 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers prepared by the in situ method and calcined under different atmospheres,
it was found that 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers calcined under
an N2 condition showed mixed phases of anatase and rutile
with a small crystallite size of 9.5 nm. This is caused by defects
that act as nucleation centers during the crystallization process.
Therefore, N2 could promote the crystallization and phase
transition.34 Besides, 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 prepared by the in situ method exhibited
the highest surface area of 58.28 m2g–1 due to Ag becoming the crystal growth center, leading to an increase
in pore volume and small size35 (see Table 1). Generally, the
surface area of catalysts is an important factor that affects the
photocatalytic activity by promoting the dispersion and more reaction
sites.36

Figure 2 XRD patterns of TiO2 nanofibers
and 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers (Ag was doped by the in situ or wetness impregnation technique). All samples
were calcined at 500 °C for 3 h under an air condition or N2 atmosphere. Standard peaks of anatase TiO2, rutile
TiO2, and Ag are included.

Optical properties and band gap energy (Eg) of photocatalysts have significant effects on photocatalytic reactions,
so the nanofibers were investigated using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. Figure 3 shows the comparison
of UV–vis absorption spectra of pristine TiO2 and
1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers (prepared by different techniques
and calcination conditions). The pristine TiO2 nanofibers
present an absorption edge at 398 nm corresponding to a band gap energy
of 3.11 eV. Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers exhibited red shifts
of the absorption edges and significant enhancements of light absorptions
in the visible light region compared with the pristine TiO2 nanofibers. For Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers prepared by
different atmospheres, it was found that Ag-doped TiO2 prepared
by the in situ technique and calcined under an N2 atmosphere increases absorption in the visible light region
with an absorption edge of about 425 nm, corresponding to the lowest
value of Eg (2.92 eV) due to the fact
that the crystal structure contained a high content of the rutile
phase37 (see Figure 2).

Figure 3 UV–vis absorption spectra of TiO2 nanofibers and 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers (Ag was
doped by the in situ or wetness impregnation technique).
All samples were calcined at 500 °C for 3 h under an air condition
or N2 atmosphere.

Photocatalytic glucose conversions on pristine TiO2 nanofibers,
1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers prepared by the in situ method at different atmospheres (air and N2), and 1 wt
% Ag-TiO2 nanofibers prepared by the wetness impregnation
method were carried out for 120 min, as shown in Figure 4. The smallest anatase crystallite
size (14.02 nm), the highest SBET (58
m2/g), and relatively small band gap (3.02 eV) in 1 wt
% Ag-TiO2 nanofibers prepared by the in situ method calcined under N2 are the reasons for the highest
photocatalytic activity. The conversions of glucose (85.49 and 68.61%
on 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers prepared by in situ and wetness methods, respectively) are reasonably higher than the
results previously reported by other researchers. For example, Chong et al.38 used hydrothermal-synthesized
TiO2 with a cocatalyst (i.e., Rh) as the photocatalyst
to achieve the glucose conversion of 61.3%. In addition, they reported
that the selective products from photocatalytic oxidations of glucose
were arabinose and erythrose. In contrast, the experimental results
in this work indicated that four organic compounds, i.e., gluconic
acid, arabinose, xylitol, and formic acid, were produced after the
120 min reaction. At the highest glucose conversion of 85.49% (from
1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers prepared by the in situ method calcined under N2), the yields of gluconic acid,
arabinose, xylitol, and formic acid were 8.55, 44.41, 21.97, and 24.48%,
respectively (Figure 4).

Figure 4 (a) Photocatalytic conversions of glucose under UV irradiation for
120 min with TiO2 nanofibers and 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers prepared by different techniques. (b) Product yields
at 120 min of photocatalysis with 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 prepared
by the in situ method (calcined under an N2 atmosphere).

Bellardita et al.39 reported the steps of oxidation of
glucose to value-added chemicals. Glucose is first oxidized at the
anomeric center (C1) to form gluconic acid, and then an oxidant attack
at the C2 carbon gives rise to a formation of formic acid and arabinose.
From these steps, it can be implied that gluconic acid can also transform
to arabinose and formic acid. Hence, the highest yield of gluconic
acid in this work (16.17%) was found at 60 min of the reaction on
1 wt % Ag-TiO2 prepared by the in situ method (calcined under N2). After that, the yield slightly
decreased because gluconic acid was converted to arabinose, formic
acid, and other organic chemicals in the solution.

From the
product analysis, we found that the main product obtained was arabinose,
wherein the possible reaction pathway of glucose conversion followed
the previous report.28 First, glucose can
be converted to gluconic acid, and the gluconic acid can be then converted
to arabinose and formic acid by photocatalytic decarboxylation. Finally,
xylitol was produced from photocatalytic decomposition of glucose
or gluconic acid.

Effect of Ag Content on Properties of TiO2 Nanofibers
In the previous section, we found that
the in situ method with calcination under N2 is the suitable condition for the synthesis of Ag-TiO2 nanofibers. The effect of Ag content (varied as 1, 2, and 4 wt %)
on the properties of nanofibers was then investigated. All catalysts
presented a rough surface, but Ag was not clearly observed on the
surface of nanofibers (see Figure 5A–C). It was found that, at a low Ag content,
the average diameters of all Ag-doped TiO2 were smaller
than those of the undoped TiO2 nanofibers. With increasing
Ag content, the average diameter of nanofibers was found to increase
(Table S1). This result is in line with
the report of Nalbandian et al.19 They found that AgNO3 not only increased the
metal content in the electrospinning solution but also increased the
viscosity of the solution, which can affect the nanofiber diameter
size. From the data of EDX, Ag on TiO2 nanofibers could
be obviously observed. The amount of the detected Ag was not equal
to the desired loading because EDX analysis represents only the surface
concentration, so many other effects such as layer thickness, Ag cluster
size, and surface coverage can strongly influence in EDX analysis.40 However, the detected Ag amount was found to
increase with increasing loading percentage, as theoretically expected.
In addition, the appearance of Ag in TiO2 nanofibers can
be confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Ag2O
(∼367.7 eV) and Ag0 (∼368.2 eV) peaks could
be observed from the samples (the result not shown here).

of 50.0k (scale bar = 1 μm) and 100k (scale bar = 500 nm), respectively.

XRD patterns of pristine TiO2 nanofibers, 1 wt
% Ag-TiO2, 2 wt % Ag-TiO2, and 4 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers prepared by the in situ method
with calcination under N2 are shown in Figure 6. The TiO2 nanofibers
have a mixture of anatase and rutile phases, as described above. The
diffraction peaks of Ag(111) and Ag(200) at 2θ of 38.1°
and 44.7°, respectively, which were not observed in 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers (because of too low content) as discussed above,
were found in a high content of Ag loading (4 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers). In addition, it was observed that the crystallite size
of anatase decreased with loading of Ag onto the TiO2 nanofibers
(Figure 7). This indicates
the rearrangement of titanium and oxygen ions in the anatase grain
boundaries, which would be greatly disturbed with the existence of
silver ions. The hindered transfer of the material in the anatase
grains increased the energy for the movement of the anatase grain
boundaries, resulting in slower grain growth.41 Also, at 4 wt % loading, the crystallite size was relatively unchanged
compared with the undoped one. It was found that an increase in silver
content decreased the phase transition from anatase to rutile42 due to the surface oxygen vacancy concentration
of anatase grains increased, which hindered the rearrangement of ions
and reorganization of the structure for the rutile phase (Table S1).

°C for 3 h.

Figure 7 Influences of (A) crystallite
size and (B) surface area on photocatalytic activity in glucose conversion
on Ag-TiO2 nanofibers.

Ag-doped TiO2 displayed a higher surface area than pure
TiO2 nanofibers, as shown in Figure 7B. Among them, 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 represented
the highest surface area of 58.3 m2/g. It could be explained
by the fact that some Ag ions might remain near the boundary of the
particles, obstructing their growth that facilitated the increase
in the surface area. On the other hand, the surface area was found
to decrease with increasing Ag content due to a high amount of Ag
that might be agglomerated on the TiO2 surface (Table S2).

Figure 8 shows the PL spectra (excitation wavelength
= 270 nm) of different amounts of Ag doping in TiO2 nanofibers
calcined at 500 °C. The PL emission peaks of Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers appeared at similar positions compared with pristine
TiO2 nanofibers, indicating that the loading of Ag had
not induced new emission. However, the relative PL intensity of Ag/TiO2 composites is quenched compared with the pristine one, suggesting
that the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes is suppressed
effectively. The photogenerated electrons in the Ag-doped samples
can transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 to Ag. An
increase in loading content of Ag can relatively reduce the recombination
chance of electrons and holes, leading to a relative lower emission
intensity.43 However, there is an optimal
loading amount. When the loading amount of Ag is relatively high,
Ag may adversely work as recombination centers for the electrons and
holes, which can reduce the suppression ability.

Photocatalytic Glucose Conversion and Recycling Ability
The performance of different photocatalysts was tested for glucose
conversion under UVA and carried out for 120 min. It was found that
Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers showed a higher glucose conversion
than pristine TiO2 nanofibers. With varying content of
the Ag loading, the highest glucose conversion (99.65%) was achieved
when 2 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers prepared by the in situ method calcined under N2 were used. This
glucose conversion was significantly higher than that of the work
previously reported by Da Viá et al.44 They found that the highest glucose conversion
under UVA irradiation was ∼12% obtained from 1.5% Ag-TiO2 nanoparticles. At the highest glucose conversion in this
work, the yields of gluconic acid, arabinose, xylitol, and formic
acid of 9.26, 44.64, 25.22, and 25.8% could be achieved (Figure 9). Interestingly,
the yield of xylitol found was three times higher than that found
in a previous work (xylitol yield = 6.45%).28 It can be concluded that the photocatalyst made of 2 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers prepared by the in situ method
and calcined under N2 has the smallest anatase crystallite
size (8.25 nm) and relatively high SBET (53.69 m2/g). These good characteristics are the possible
reasons of the highest photocatalytic activity.

of glucose under UVA irradiation for 120 min using TiO2 nanofibers and Ag-loaded TiO2 nanofibers prepared by
the in situ technique with calcination under an N2 atmosphere as photocatalysts. (b) Product yields at 120 min
of those catalysts.

The photocatalytic performance
of 2 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers was higher than a commercial
TiO2 (P25) in terms of glucose conversion and product selectivity
(for arabinose and xylitol) (Figure 10). Interestingly, photocatalytic performance and product
selectivity of pristine TiO2 nanofibers that were lower
than Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers were higher than sol–gel
synthesized nanoparticles (Figure 11). Moreover, Ag-doped nanofibers still present higher
photocatalytic activity than Ag-doped nanoparticles. This confirms
the advancement of nanofibers that has a lower grain boundary and
one-directional oriented nanofibrils compared with the particles.
These characteristics cause the basic properties of nanofibers, such
as high surface area, high electron transfer, and low charge recombination.

It is interesting to test performance of Ag-TiO2 nanofibers under solar light irradiation for the potential to actual
uses in daylight applications. The photocatalytic glucose conversion
under solar light was tested using a solar simulator. The solar simulator
consists of a xenon lamp (300 W) as a light source, which is composed
of 10% UV, 34% visible light, and 56% infrared. Figure 12 shows the photocatalytic
conversion of glucose under solar light for 120 min between 2wt %
Ag-TiO2 nanofibers and P25. It was found that Ag-TiO2 nanofibers achieved a higher glucose conversion (48%) than
P25 (16%). This conversion operated under solar light irradiation
(for 120 min) was comparable with the conversion by nanoparticles
reported by Bellardita et al.45 They used Pt-TiO2 nanoparticles as the photocatalysts,
wherein the highest glucose conversion of 62.1% was achieved after
operation under solar light for 360 min.45 In addition, in this work, it was found that arabinose was detected
as the main product, which exhibited a percentage of 24%. Meanwhile,
formic acid, xylitol, and gluconic acid showed yields of 12, 10, and
8%, respectively (Figure S1). It could
be concluded that Ag-TiO2 nanofibers not only enhance photocatalytic
performance in UV irradiation but also allow a significant level of
visible light-driven photocatalytic activity, while P25 shows high
performance of photocatalytic activity under only UV irradiation.

Figure 12 Photocatalytic
conversions of glucose under solar light for 120 min with Ag-TiO2 nanofibers and P25.

The recycling ability of Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers was
investigated by glucose conversion for four-cycle use. The Ag-doped
TiO2 nanofibers was recovered by filtering and washing
by deionized water several times with 70 °C overnight drying
before reuse. From Figure 13, the photocatalytic efficiency of glucose conversion could
be maintained at high photocatalytic activity (∼99%) after
four-time reuse. Thus, it can be concluded that Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers were relatively stable and effective in glucose conversion
for production of value-added chemicals.

photocatalytic activities of 2 wt %Ag-TiO2 toward glucose
conversion.

Conclusions
From
different doping methods, the results indicated that 1 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers prepared by the in situ method
with calcination under N2 achieved the highest glucose
conversion (85.49%). From several Ag loading contents (i.e., 0, 1,
2, and 4 wt %) in Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers, the nanofibers
exhibited different glucose conversions [in order of 2 wt % (99.65%)
> 1 wt % (85.49%) > 4 wt % (77.72%) > 0 wt % (29.64%)]. Four
high-value chemicals, i.e., arabinose, xylitol, gluconic acid, and
formic acid, were found with the photocatalytic reaction of TiO2 and Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers under UVA irradiation.
Product yields of each converted chemicals from different photocatalysts
from different Ag loading contents showed relatively same trends with
the glucose conversion. From all results, it can be concluded that
the good characteristics of 2 wt % Ag-TiO2 nanofibers such
as the smallest anatase crystallite size (8.25 nm) and the highest
specific surface area (SBET = 53.69 m2/g) promoted the highest photocatalytic activity. TiO2 and Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers exhibited higher
photocatalytic performance for glucose conversion than commercial
P25 and synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles. Finally, Ag-doped
TiO2 nanofibers showed recycling ability with high photocatalytic
glucose conversion after four-time use.

Experimental Section
Fabrication
of TiO2 Nanofibers
TiO2 nanofibers
were fabricated by combination of sol–gel and electrospinning.
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; Aldrich; Mw of 1,300,000; 0.8 g) was dissolved in 10 mL of methanol (ACL labscan,
AR grade). Titanium(IV) butoxide (TiBu, Aldrich; 4 g) and acetylacetone
(ACA, Aldrich; 1.175 g) were added to the solution, and the solution
was then stirred overnight. The precursor solution was loaded into
a plastic syringe (spinneret = 22 gauge needle, distance from spinneret
to collector = 15 cm, and applied electrical potential = 15 kV).20 The feed rate of solution was set at 2 mL/h.
The fibers were left at room temperature for 5 h to allow complete
hydrolysis followed by calcination at 500 °C for 2 h.

Fabrication
of Ag-Loaded TiO2 Nanofibers
Ag-loaded TiO2 nanofibers were prepared by in situ and
wetness impregnation methods. For the in situ method,
PVP (Mw = 1,300,000; 0.8 g) was dissolved
in 10 mL of methanol. TiBu (4 g) and ACA (1.175 g) were added to the
solution the same as the conventional process. After that, the calculated
amount of the silver precursor (AgNO3, VWR chemicals BDH,
AR grade) was added to the solution and stirred overnight. Electrospinning
was carried out with the same process as the pristine TiO2 nanofibers. The fibers were left at room temperature for 5 h to
allow complete hydrolysis followed by calcination at 500 °C under
an air or N2 atmosphere for 2 h. For the wetness impregnation
method, Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers were prepared using AgNO3 aqueous solution as the precursor for Ag loading. Only an
Ag composition of 1 wt % in TiO2 was used for comparison.
The solution of AgNO3 was slowly dropped on as-spun TiO2 nanofibers at 60 °C. Finally, the Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers were sintered at 400 °C under an N2 atmosphere
for 4 h.

Characterizations of Catalysts
X-ray diffraction (XRD)
(Rigaku, Smartlab) was used to identify the crystalline phase of prepared
catalysts using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) at 40
kV and 30 mA. The surface morphology and particle sizes of prepared
catalysts were observed using a scanning electron microscope (FESEM,
Hitachi SU-6600). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in FESEM
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD)
were used to confirm the appearance of Ag. High-resolution images
were obtained using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL
JEM-2100) operated at 200 kV. Surface area, pore size, and pore volume
were investigated by N2 adsorption (BEL Japan, BELSORP
18) analyzed by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method.

Photocatalytic Test
The photocatalytic conversion of glucose
was carried out under UV irradiation using a 450 W mercury lamp in
a Pyrex cylindrical double-walled reactor at room temperature and
ambient pressure. The reaction temperature was maintained using a
water cooling system. The initial glucose concentration was 1 g/L
in a mixture of distilled water and acetonitrile (10:90 v/v).20 The reaction time for photocatalytic glucose
conversion was 120 min. Before photocatalytic reaction, the solution
was continuously stirred for 30 min under a dark condition until the
homogeneous suspension of the photocatalyst was obtained and surface
adsorption was completed. The samples were taken from the photoreactor
at specified times and filtrated through a 0.22 mm nylon filter to
remove TiO2 nanofibers. The glucose conversion was then
monitored, and photocatalytic products were identified and quantitatively
analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC Shimadzu,
LC-20 AD pump) equipped with a refractive index detector (Shimudzu
RID-10A). HPLC separation was performed in an Aminex HPX-87H column
(300 × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad). The mobile phase was sulfuric acid (5
mM) at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min and an injection volume of 20 μL.
Glucose conversion was calculated using eq 1. 1
