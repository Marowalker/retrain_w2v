The intrinsic physical properties
of nanostructures of metals and
their oxides are altered when they are prone to surface oxidation
in ambient atmosphere. To overcome this limitation, novel synthesis
methodologies are required. In this study, solid octahedral shapes
of MnO limit the inward oxygen diffusion compared to that of the MnO-nanoparticle-assembled
octahedra. In addition to morphology control, which restricts the
thickness of the Mn3O4 surface layer, the binding
chemistry of the surfactants plays an essential role. For example,
the Mn3O4 surface layer is 0.4 nm thinner with
trioctylphosphine oxide than with trioctylamine as the surfactant.
The nanostructures were prepared by varying the surfactants, surfactant-to-precursor
molar ratio, accelerating agent, and reaction heating rate. The surface
oxidation of MnO nano-octahedra was probed by Rietveld analysis of
X-ray diffraction patterns and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
characterized by magnetic measurements, as the presence of ferrimagnetic
Mn3O4 shell on the antiferromagnetic MnO core
provides an exchange coupling at the core–shell interface.
Thicker the Mn3O4 shell, higher is the exchange-biased
hysteresis loop shift.

Introduction
Transition metals and
their oxides with different shapes and sizes
have been a subject of intense interest among researchers owing to
their enormous size and morphology-dependent potential applications
in sensors,1 magnetic resonance imaging,2 catalysis,3−5 and high-performance permanent
magnets.6 Because of the high fraction
of surface atoms, their nanoparticles (NPs) are especially prone to
surface oxidation in ambient atmosphere. The uncontrolled inward diffusion
of oxygen atoms results in biphasic core–shell NPs with the
intact core, shelled by the oxide phase of a metal with a higher oxidation
state.7,8 This surface oxidation, however, compromises
the material properties.9 The 3d transition
metal NPs of Co, Fe, and Ni are the most affected ones, whose ferromagnetic
(FM) moments decrease after exposure to air. In fact, these metal
NPs are more prone to oxidation when prepared from the thermal decomposition
of precursors with oxygen-containing anions, such as acetates, acetyl
acetonates, carbonyls, and so on.10 On
the other hand, reductive decomposition of noncarbonyl organometallic
complexes, such as [Co(η3-C8H13)(η4-C8H12)] or [Fe{N[Si(CH3)3]2}2], produces NPs with
thinner surface-oxide layers.11 In addition,
oxidation from air contact during the workup of the synthesized products
can be avoided if washing is performed in N2/Ar atmosphere.12 Surface oxidation of NPs is also inhibited by
creating a shell of carbon or other metal ions.13,14 This study shows that an appropriate choice of surfactants and octahedron-shaped
nanostructures can minimize the surface oxidation.

Recent advances
in chemical methods such as hot injection, thermal
decomposition, and coprecipitation paved the way to produce NPs with
a narrow size distribution.15,16 Surfactants such as
trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), trioctylamine (TOAm), oleyl amine
(OAm), and oleic acid (OA) play a major role in determining the morphologies
of these nanocrystals.17,18 Their shape and size can be adjusted
by changing the precursor-to-surfactant ratio, solvents, temperature,
and heating rates.19 The crystal facets
and the energetically favored crystalline directions also change with
the synthesis methodologies.20 Octahedron-shaped
metal oxides are particularly interesting because of their active
{111} surface atoms and highly energetic edges and corners. Furthermore,
these octahedral nanostructures have a range of applications; for
example, those of Co3O4 and SnO2 are
employed in gas sensing;21 SnO2 in high-performance Li-ion batteries;22 and MnO octahedra in cataluminescence sensing,23 supercapacitors,24 and photodecomposition.25

Herein, we demonstrate the formation of
solid nano-octahedra as
well as the clustering of MnO NPs into octahedra using different surfactants,
precursor-to-surfactant ratios, and reaction rates. MnO is considered
as the representative oxide material because manganese is prone to
transit from +2 to its higher oxidation states. The surface oxidation
of these nanostructures is probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and Rietveld analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and
further characterized by magnetic exchange coupling. The solid nano-octahedra
are least oxidized compared to that of the NP-clustered octahedral
nanostructures. The ferrimagnetic (FiM) Mn3O4 surface layers over the antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnO core increase
the magnetic moment and generate exchange anisotropy due to interface
spin coupling between the MnO core and the Mn3O4 shell. Exchange coupling refers to the shift of the hysteresis loop
along the magnetic-field axis in materials with AFM-FiM/FM interfaces
when field-cooled through Néel temperature (TN) of the AFM phase such that the FiM/FM Curie temperature
(TC) is greater than TN.8

Results and Discussion
Structural
and Morphological Analysis
All of the samples
crystallize in the face-centered cubic crystal structure of MnO, and
the lattice parameter of a = 0.444 nm calculated
from the XRD patterns in Figure 1a is consistent with JCPDS card no. 07-0230. There
is no noticeable secondary phase observed in the XRD patterns. The
crystallite sizes obtained using the Scherrer equation are 27.6, 27.3,
and 28.1 nm for M-1 (prepared with TOPO and benzyl ether), M-2 (prepared
with OA and TOAm), and M-3 (prepared with TOAm), respectively. Rietveld
refinements of the XRD patterns show that best fits are obtained with
a minor Mn3O4 phase in addition to MnO (Figure 1b–d). The
fitted Mn3O4 phases are 3, 5, and 3.7% in M-1,
M-2, and M-3, respectively (Table 1). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
images and the corresponding histograms for M-1, M-2, and M-3 are
illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows the
morphological evolution of the NPs depending on the nature of surfactant,
surfactant-to-precursor molar ratio, accelerating agent, and reaction
heating rate. Both M-1 and M-3 are octahedron shaped, whereas M-2
has spherical (diameter ∼20 nm) NPs self-assembled into octahedral
clusters. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that
both M-1 and M-3 have a side length of ∼80 nm, whereas that
of M-2 is ∼160 nm (Figure 4). The solid octahedra of the representative M-1 are
highly crystalline with well-defined lattice fringes of MnO (111)
plane having a d-spacing of 2.5 Å (Figure 4a), which matches
well with the XRD reflections. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns
recorded from the edges of M-1 octahedra also show the (111) and (220)
reflections of MnO (Figure 4a inset). A 2D projection of a regular octahedron is shown
in Figure 4b with the
corresponding TEM images. The self-assembly of NPs into M-2 octahedra
is clearly visible in the inset of Figure 4c. In spite of the presence of smaller NPs
of M-2 compared with the larger solid octahedra of M-1 and M-3, the
XRD crystallite sizes are similar, as the 20 nm NPs of M-2 can be
considered to be bulklike with sharp XRD peaks.26 Although the nanostructures appear to be porous, the surface
area is extremely small, with magnitudes of 10.5, 3.0, and 4.5 m2/g for M-1, M-2, and M-3, respectively (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

Formation Mechanism
By varying the surfactants, such
as TOPO, TOAm, OAm, and OA, and their combination with 1,2-dodecanediol
(DDD) as a cosurfactant, the morphology of the nanostructures could
be controlled in the single-pot reaction. All of the reactions were
performed at 290 °C because the boiling points of all of these
surfactants are above 300 °C. Among the surfactants, TOPO and
TOAm contain 8C in a single chain, whereas OAm and OA have 18C with
a double bond. Surfactants with 8C, such as octyl amine or octanoic
acid, could not be used for comparing the morphologies because they
have boiling points below 250 °C. When only TOPO is used, the
molar ratio of TOPO to Mn(acac)2 precursor of 2.5:1 is
found to be sufficient to obtain the solid octahedral shapes (Figure 4a). When TOPO is
reduced to 0.5 from 2.5, NP clusters are obtained (Figure S2), which highlights the requirement of an optimum
concentration of the surfactant to create octahedral shapes. The nature of the surfactant
also plays a critical role in maintaining the 2.5:1 ratio with Mn(acac)2, and TOAm only results in spherical NPs. To produce MnO octahedra,
a higher amount of TOAm is needed such that the TOAm/Mn(acac)2 molar ratio is ≥7. When a long-chain fatty acid, such
as OA, is added to the branched TOAm such that the molar ratio of
TOAm/OA is 7:2, an NP-assembled octahedron is obtained as in M-2 (Figure 4c). In the absence
of branched surfactants, such as TOPO or TOAm, clusters of spherical
NPs are obtained (not shown). This clearly substantiates the importance
of branched surfactants in creating octahedral shapes of metal oxides.
Our results are in direct contrast to those of Fontaíña-Troitiño
et al., who showed that OA plays a key role in stabilizing the octahedral
shape, as OA selectively binds the {111} facets.27 However, Lu et al. showed that OA selectively binds the
{100} facets and produces cube-shaped particles.28 The different functional groups on TOPO, TOAm, OA, OAm,
and DDD have different binding energies at the NP surface, to control
their morphology.29,30

The surfactants or their
mixtures with different binding affinities to the NP surface and selectivity
toward certain crystal facets provide control over the size and morphology
of the nanostructures. The growth of the nano-octahedra is largely
due to the minimization of the facets with high surface energy. Branched-chain
hydrocarbon surfactants such as TOPO and TOAm promote limiting surface
tension and stabilize the low-surface-energy facets of NPs in contrast
to linear-chain surfactants, such as OA.31 The larger nano-octahedra of M-1 and M-3 could be the result of
nucleation followed by aggregation when the surfactant molecules peel
off from the low-energy facets of the NP surface.30 To minimize the surface energy, the majorly unprotected
high-energy facets will facilitate this aggregation even further.
When OA is added alongside TOAm, the high-energy facets are also protected
and thereby 20 nm NPs are stabilized in M-2. With a relatively higher
concentration of TOAm, the NPs self-assemble in octahedral shapes.

Accelerating agents such as DDD are crucial in preparing faceted
nanostructures.32 In all of the reactions
of M-1 to M-3, the molar ratio of DDD to Mn(acac)2 is maintained
at 2.5:1 and in the absence of DDD spherical NPs are obtained (Figure S3). Moreover, to obtain octahedron-shaped
structures of M-1, the reaction mixture was heat-treated from room
temperature to 250 °C at 4 °C/min and further up to 290
°C at 8 °C/min. To identify the effect of reaction rate
on the final morphology, when the reaction is ramped up to 290 °C
at 10 °C/min, spherical NP clusters are produced (Figure S4). Low reaction rates benefit the controlled
nucleation of the crystal lattice, subsequent fast random attachment
of the nuclei, and intraparticle ripening, that is, the diffusion
of reactants along the surface of the nucleus to alter the shape temporally.33 Low reaction rates will, however, increase the
size of the octahedra, which is energetically more favored.6 In the formation of octahedral shapes, surface
energies of the different facets create an instability, which is minimized
by the slow dissolution of the high-energy facets via intraparticle
diffusion. This leads to the growth of low-energy facets with an increase
in particle size, in this case up to ∼80 nm side length of
the M-1 and M-3 octahedra.

Surface Oxidation
The samples were
synthesized in N2 atmosphere. Washing, drying, and storage
were performed under
ambient atmosphere for similar durations, to compare the surface oxidation
of the nanostructures. The characterization of the samples was performed
simultaneously or in close time intervals. Moreover, XRD data were
collected at different intervals (1, 10, and 30 days) and the patterns
were observed to be similar according to JCPDS card no. 07-0230, without
any noticeable Mn3O4 reflection. The samples
were also allowed to withstand additional 30 days before performing
the XPS and magnetic measurements. To investigate the effect of solid
∼80 nm MnO octahedra (M-1) compared to that of the NP-assembled
octahedra (M-2) on surface oxidation, the XPS spectra were analyzed
with best fit to different oxidation states of manganese (Figure 5a,b). In M-2, each
of the self-assembled NPs has their surface accessible for air oxidation
in contrast to only the outer surface of the solid M-1 octahedra.
Second, the Mn2+ ions of MnO can be oxidized to the immediately
higher oxidation state of Mn3+ in the form of cubic α/γ-Mn2O3 or the normal spinel structure of Mn3O4. Taking a cue from the Rietveld refinements of the
XRD patterns, the XPS peaks are best fitted from the Mn 2p3/2 level with the binding energies of 640.4–640.7 eV for Mn2+ in MnO/Mn3O4 (1) and 642.3–642.8
eV for Mn3+ in Mn3O4 (2).34,35 As XPS is a surface-sensitive technique, the information is obtained
only up to a few atomic layers below the surface and therefore the
formation of the Mn3O4 phase at the MnO surface
is well substantiated. The extra peak at 644.8 eV is due to the distinctive
satellite peak of Mn (3). Limited oxygen diffusion through the solid
octahedral nanostructures of M-1 results in a thinner Mn3O4 surface layer compared to that of the self-assembled
NPs of M-2, where oxygen diffusion is random. This has been verified
from the Mn3+/Mn2+ ratio of 0.6 in M-1 compared
to 1.5 in M-2.

Figure 5 XPS spectra of (a) M-1 and (b) M-2.

The resistance to surface oxidation of M-1 octahedra is further
verified from the loop shift in the negative direction of the field
axis due to the exchange coupling at the AFM/FiM interface (Figure 6a,b).8,36,37 At the MnO/Mn3O4 interface, a torque is created on the Mn3O4 spins (Figure 6b inset) and an exchange coupling takes place when the samples were
cooled in the presence of a 2 T magnetic field from above TC of Mn3O4 to below TN of MnO. Thicker surface-oxidized shells will
therefore result in larger loop shifts. The exchange bias equivalents
to the loop shifts are observed to be 1358 and 2648 Oe for M-1 and
M-2, respectively (Figure 6a,b). The nearly double loop shift in M-2 clearly verifies
a thicker well-defined oxidized Mn3O4 shell
in each NP. Furthermore, because there is a collection of NPs in M-2,
multiple MnO/Mn3O4 interfaces increase the exchange
coupling rate. Because of the surface Mn3O4 layer,
M-1 and M-2 demonstrate atypical moments of 1.15 and 1.23μB/Mn, respectively. In fact, the small moment for M-1 is consistent
with other reports on MnO,26 which suggests
that the M-1 octahedra allow limited surface oxidation and hence the
thin Mn3O4 shell has a minimal effect on the
total magnetization. The thickness of the Mn3O4 shell is calculated from the equation of the random-field model
of exchange anisotropy: HE = 2(AAFMKAFM)1/2/(MFiMtFiM), where, HE is the magnitude of the
hysteresis loop shift (exchange anisotropy field); KAFM = 9 × 103 erg/cm3 and AAFM are the uniaxial anisotropy energy and the
exchange stiffness of the MnO core, respectively; and MFiM and tFiM are the magnetization
and thickness of the Mn3O4 surface layer, respectively.38AAFM is estimated
to be 5 × 10–7 erg/cm, and different metal
oxides show almost similar AAFM values.
With HE = 1358 Oe and MFiM = 9.1 emu/g, the thickness (tFiM) of the Mn3O4 layer of M-1 is found
to be 2 nm, and with HE = 2684 Oe and MFiM = 9.7 emu/g, M-2 has a Mn3O4 layer thickness of 3.4 nm. The higher layer thickness of
1.4 nm of M-2 than M-1 reflects the impact of the oxidized surface
layer on the magnetic property of M-2.

M-2, and M-3 at 5 K recorded in a field range of ±4 T after 2
T field cooling. (b) M–H curves
in a low-field range showing the corresponding loop shifts. Inset
shows the image of the exchange coupling at the AFM/FiM interface
and the pinning of the FiM spins by AFM spins when the field (H) is reversed.

Role of Binding Chemistry
Besides nanostructure morphology,
surface chemistry is found to play a major role in determining the
extent of surface oxidation. Although M-1 and M-3 have nearly identical
shapes, their capping agents differ, namely, TOPO for M-1 and TOAm
for M-3. The Mn3+/Mn2+ ratio for M-3 is observed
to be 0.8 (Figure S5) as opposed to 0.6
for M-1. The thickness of the Mn3O4 surface
layer in M-3 is calculated to be 2.4 nm from the exchange bias loop
shift of 1665 Oe and the magnetic moment of 0.79μB/Mn (Figure 6a,b).
With similar carbonic tails and flexible conformers, both TOPO and
TOAm will have indistinguishable distribution over the octahedron
surface. Hereby, we hypothesize that oxygen affinity when TOPO is
bound through the oxygen of the O=P moiety on the M-1 octahedron
surface is less than that when TOAm is bound through N-groups in M-3.
Therefore, chances of aerial oxidation are much higher in M-3. Hence,
surface oxidation can be also controlled depending on the binding
chemistry between the surfactant and the surface of the nanostructures.

Conclusions
In summary, both morphology- and surfactant-dependent
control of
surface oxidation was demonstrated, taking MnO as the representative
system and Mn3O4 as its surface-oxidized phase.
The octahedral nanostructures were prepared by varying the nature
and amount of surfactant, accelerating agent, and reaction rates.
Oxygen diffusion was restricted in the solid octahedra than in the
self-assembled NP octahedra. The solid MnO octahedra (M-1) prepared
using TOPO and benzyl ether had a 2 nm thick Mn3O4 surface layer, whereas the solid octahedra (M-3) synthesized using
TOAm and the NP-assembled octahedra (M-2) prepared with OA and TOAm
had Mn3O4 shells of thicknesses 3.4 and 2.4
nm, respectively. XPS analysis revealed the Mn3+/Mn2+ ratios of M-1, M-2, and M-3 to be 0.6, 1.5, and 0.8, respectively.
The hysteresis loop shifts arising from the exchange coupling at the
MnO/Mn3O4 interface provided additional evidence
of surface oxidation control. The loop shifts were 1358, 1665, and
2648 Oe for M-1, M-3, and M-2, respectively, in accordance with the
extent of surface oxidation. Our strategy of surfactant-mediated morphology
control to prevent surface oxidation can be extended to other metals/oxides.

Methods
XRD measurements
were carried out with a Rigaku
(MiniFlex II, Japan) powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα
radiation of wavelength 1.54059 Å. Rietveld refinements were
performed by General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) software (Los
Alamos National Laboratory Report, 2004). The GSAS was run under least-squares
refinement condition. FESEM images were recorded in a Carl Zeiss SUPRA
55VP field emission scanning electron microscope. TEM images were
obtained by UHR-FEG-TEM, JEOL, JEM 2100 F model using a 200 kV electron
source. The surface-area measurements were carried out with a Micromeritics
Gemini VII surface area analyzer. XPS studies were carried out on
the samples mounted on copper stubs with silver paste using Al Kα
radiation (1486.6 eV) in a commercial photoelectron spectrometer obtained
from VSW Scientific Instruments. The base pressure of the chamber
was maintained around 5 × 10–10 mbar. Before
XPS measurements, the samples were kept in vacuum to avoid moisture
adsorption. The XPS analysis was performed in an Omicron XPS system
working at a base pressure of −5 × 10–10 Torr. The Al Kα X-ray source was used for excitation, and
the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons was measured by a 250 mm
multichannel hemispherical analyzer. Survey scans were acquired with
a 100 eV pass energy (1 eV resolution), whereas the core levels were
acquired at a 25 eV pass energy with a 0.1 eV resolution at 90% of
peak height. The acquired data were background-corrected by the Shirley
method, and the peaks were fitted using the Fityk software, with Voigt
peaks having 80% Gaussian and 20% Lorentzian components to find the
valence states of the elements. The magnetic properties were studied
using the Cryogenics, Physical Property Measurements System, with
VSM probe, in the temperature range of 5–300 K and applied
fields of up to 4 T.
