Branched
amphiphilic peptide capsules (BAPCs) are an efficient
transport system that can deliver nucleic acids, small proteins, and
solutes. The ability of BAPCs to break down is essential to their
adoption as a delivery vehicle for human and agricultural applications.
Until now, however, BAPCs were shown to be inert to mammalian degradation
systems. Here, we demonstrate, using BAPCs encapsulating the toxic
urea analogue thiourea, that the common soil fungus Aspergillus nidulans can degrade BAPCs. We provide
evidence that this degradation is extracellular through the action
of secreted proteases. Our data indicate that BAPCs are likely biodegradable
in the environment.

Introduction
An efficient amino acid-derived nanoscale
delivery method that
facilitates oral delivery and cellular uptake of biopesticides that
is biodegradable could greatly reduce the environmental load of active
ingredients currently employed in agriculture. The Tomich lab has
developed such a delivery agent. It is a self-assembling cationic
nanocapsule composed of branched amphiphilic peptides (BAPs). As the
peptides anneal, they form peptide bilayer-delimited capsules capable
of encapsulating solutes in an aqueous environment. These BAP capsules
(BAPCs) are prepared from two branched peptides—bis(Ac-FLIVI)-K-KKKK-CO-NH2 (CAS RN 1492039-67-4) and bis(Ac-FLIVIGSII)-K-KKKK-CO-NH2 (CAS RN 1492039-68-5).1 The two
peptides can assemble either singly or together using different assembly
temperatures to alter the sizes of the nanocapsules.2 Fully formed BAPCs range in diameter from 10 to >500
nm
depending on the annealing conditions.3 BAPCs encapsulating fluorescent dyes are taken up by several epithelial
cell lines, including HeLa (CCL-2), HEK-293 (CRL-11268), CasKi (CRL-1550),
and N/N 1003A rabbit lens epithelial cells, through the endocytic
pathway and then become localized in the perinuclear space.4,5 They show minimal cytotoxicity to cultured HeLa cells.6 In all previous studies, BAPCs have proven to
be resistant to cellular degradative machinery and encapsulated active
ingredients were not released from the capsules.5 This lack of break down currently limits the utility of
BAPCs for encapsulated drug delivery.

The cation surface of
these nanoparticles can also bind and deliver
a variety of nucleic acids. BAPCs were used in insects for oral delivery
of dsRNAs directed to silence genes involved in the protein refolding
pathway.7 If the capsules are to be deployed
in the environment, they need to be biodegradable to avoid environmental
accumulation.

For this study, the common soil fungus Aspergillus
nidulans was chosen to demonstrate fungal biodegradation
of BAPCs. The Aspergillus genus is
ubiquitous and very frequently occurs in soil.8−11 A well-known characteristic of
fungi is the secretion of extracellular proteases for breaking down
proteins in the surrounding environment for nutrient acquisition,
making them excellent candidates to possess BAPC peptide capsule degradation
capability.12 Here, we show that this fungus
degrades BAPCs. It can be inferred that the capsules would be broken
down in the soil and, therefore, will not build up in the environment.
It is important to note that proteases are conserved and therefore
other species are expected to have similar BAPC degradation properties.

Results
and Discussion
To determine whether A. nidulans can degrade the peptide capsules, water soluble thiourea (TU), an
analogue of urea known to be toxic when taken up by A. nidulans,13 was encapsulated
during BAPC formation and used to assess whether TU could be released
from the BAPCs and cause growth inhibition on A. nidulans spread plates (Scheme 1). We reasoned that the peptide capsules are likely to be degraded
by proteases, and therefore used media containing milk as a de-repressing
nitrogen source known to favor protease expression.12Figure 1A shows the results of treating wild type MH1 with the TU-encapsulated
BAPCs compared with water-encapsulated BAPCs. The lawn of A. nidulans growth is visible as the green color
of the asexual spores (conidia) when treated with water-BAPCs, while
treatment with TU-BAPCs conferred a zone of growth inhibition at the
center of the plate (mean diameter ± standard error = 38.4 ±
4.36 mm) characterized by mycelium with reduced conidiation (asexual
spore production) and displaying a brown pigmentation reaction encircled
by a less intense green color, typical of reduced conidiation. A level
of background growth occurs within the zone of TU-BAPC inhibition
as the fungus must grow prior to producing the degrading enzymes that
release the TU. Because the BAPCs were thoroughly washed to remove
any surface-bound TU, the observed growth inhibition suggests that
the contents of the BAPCs were released through the disassembly of
the peptide bilayer through the action of one or more proteases.

indicate the zone of inhibition.

Scheme 1 Spread Plate Assay for BAPC Degradation
To confirm that fungal proteases are involved, cultures were established
using the mutant strain, MK85 (xprG1). This strain
has increased extracellular protease production because of a gain-of-function
mutation in the p53-like transcription factor XprG, which regulates
the expression of extracellular protease genes.14,15 The results of this experiment showed a larger and clearer zone
of inhibition for MK85 (mean diameter ± standard error = 45.6
± 3.52 mm) than for the wild type strain MH1 (Figure 1B).

Next, we developed
an assay for the degradation of TU-containing
BAPCs by MH1 (wild type) or MK85 (xprG1) fungal cells
in liquid culture (Scheme 2). The liquid cultures were prepared, then the filtered fungus-free
media was concentrated, and spotted at the center of a wild type MH1
spread plate (Figure 2A,B). No growth inhibition was evident from the filtrate from either
the wild type or xprG1 water-BAPC or no BAPC treatment.
In contrast, a zone of mild growth inhibition, evident as reduced
green density of conidiation at the center of the plate was observed
for the wild type TU-BAPC filtrate (Figure 2A). This indicates that secreted proteases
were present in the media of the liquid cultures and that they had
broken down TU-encapsulated BAPCs thereby releasing the fungicide.
A larger zone of inhibition was observed for the TU-BAPC-treated filtrate
from the MK85 (xprG1) culture (Figure 2B). This is consistent with the involvement
of proteases in BAPC degradation. It is important to note the possibility
of an alternative interpretation that the BAPCs could have been degraded
intracellularly with the subsequent excretion of the fungicide into
the media. However, because of the known elevated expression of extracellular
proteases in the xprG1 gain-of-function mutant, we
favor the interpretation that the degradation is performed by an extracellular
protease.

Conclusions
BAPCs are being tested for their ability to deliver nucleic acids
designed to be biocides. In all animal species tested, the BAPCs remain
intact and show no cytotoxicity when given at clinical dosages.7 An early concern has been the accumulation of
the peptide nanoparticles in the environment, should they be used
on an agricultural scale. Based on our experiments, it is clear that
a wild type ubiquitous soil fungus can proteolyze these structures.
Furthermore, the increased diameter of the zone of inhibition observed
with the MK85 gain-of-function mutant, which was originally selected
for elevated extracellular protease production, provided evidence
that the fungus produced an extracellular protease capable of BAPC
degradation. The candidate enzyme(s) responsible for BAPC degradation
are being sought. ε-Poly-l-lysine-degrading enzyme
from Streptomyces albulus (BAE53412.2)
is known to break down the bond found in the branch point in BAPCs.16 Preliminary sequence database searches reveal
sequence similarity to several hypothetical proteases in A. nidulans. There are many other species with potential
orthologues to the assumed BAPC-degrading enzyme according to sequence
similarity.

There is much work to be done to give a comprehensive
molecular
analysis of BAPC breakdown. BAPCs can now be considered biodegradable
because of the ability of A. nidulans to degrade the capsules and release their contents. A. nidulans, like other Aspergillus species, is widely distributed in the soil in a range of biomes
and latitudes.10 Studies of fungal density
in cultivated agricultural soils report filamentous fungi to occur
at 104 to 105 colony forming units per gram
of soil.17,18 Our results, when considered with the abundance
of Aspergilli in soils and longer environmental time-frames than the
two-day time-point used in our studies, suggest that the accumulation
of BAPCs in the environment should not present a sizable hurdle to
their introduction as biocide carriers. The accumulation of nanoparticles
in the soil will be avoided if BAPCs are used to deliver biocides
composed of biodegradable nucleic acids.

Experimental Section
BAPC Formation
The two self-assembling peptides, bis(Ac-FLIVI)-K-KKKK-CO-NH2 and bis(Ac-FLIVIGSII)-K-KKKK-CO-NH2, were chemically
synthesized as previously described.4 BAPCs
were prepared by mixing equimolar concentrations (1 mM each) of the
two branched peptides dissolved in trifluoroethanol. Under these conditions
the peptides do not associate and remain monomeric. They were dried
in vacuo and rehydrated dropwise in sterile water for controls or
with water containing the active ingredient. The nascent particles
were subjected to a temperature shift protocol previously described
yielding 20–30 nm nanoparticles.3 Because it takes ∼1600 peptides to make one BAPC, the final
concentration was 1.3 μM. BAPCs loaded with the active ingredient
were dried and then resuspended in 50 μL of water at a final
concentration of 20 μM BAPCs.

Fungicide Encapsulation
Water soluble TU (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) was encapsulated at a concentration of 1.865 M during BAPC
assembly. The TU-encapsulated BAPCs were washed several times to remove
externally bound active ingredient, as previously described.

A. nidulans Strains and Growth
A. nidulans strain MH1 (biA1 veA1) was used as wild type (M.J. Hynes, University
of Melbourne; deposited in the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC),
Manhattan KS, as FGSC A2291).19A. nidulans MK85 (biA1 xprG1 niiA4 veA1) is an xprG1 gain-of-function mutant de-repressed
for extracellular proteases (M.E. Katz, University of New England;
FGSC A1630).14,15 Fungal growth and manipulations
were conducted, and growth media were prepared as previously described.20 Spore suspensions were generated, by surface
scraping, at a density of one 12–14 mm diameter colony per
400 μL of 0.005% Tween-80 (Sigma), grown from point-inoculation
on complete media for two days at 37 °C.

Solid media were
prepared using polystyrene 100 × 15 mm Petri dishes (KORD-Valmark
Labware Products) and Aspergillus nitrogen-free medium (ANM) containing
1% glucose as the carbon source, supplements to repair auxotrophies,
and 1% (w/v) skim milk (Kroger Co.) as the nitrogen source.14

Plate Tests for Degradation of Fungicide-Encapsulated
BAPC
A. nidulans spore suspension
(50
μL) was spread on the plates using glass beads (≤160
μm) (Sigma) to obtain homogeneous lawns, as described.21 After 20 min, the TU-BAPC samples described
above were spotted at the center of the plates at volumes of 10 and
40 μL. Plates were incubated at 37 °C and analyzed at 24
and 48 h. Three biological replicates were performed.

BAPC Degradation
in Liquid Culture Assay
Two mL liquid
cultures comprising supplemented liquid ANM with 1% milk as the nitrogen
source and 50 μL of BAPC (1.3 μM) were inoculated with
50 μL of A. nidulans spore suspension.
The test sample consisted of BAPCs containing a 1.865 M TU solution,
and BAPC-free and water-encased BAPC controls were included. The samples,
in 25 mL conical flasks, were grown with shaking at 160 oscillations
per minute for two days at 37 °C in an orbital shaking incubator.
After incubation, conditioned media was filtered through Miracloth
(Millipore-Sigma). Filtered media (20 μL) was spotted onto a
thick chromatography paper (grade 238, Ahlstrom Filtration Inc.) 5
mm diameter disk and placed in the center of a supplemented ANM-1%
milk plate spread with spores 20 min prior. The remaining media was
freeze-dried then rehydrated with a small volume (250 μL) to
increase its concentration. Concentrated media (20 μL) were
then spotted on the chromatography paper disks on milk plates. Three
biological replicates were performed.
