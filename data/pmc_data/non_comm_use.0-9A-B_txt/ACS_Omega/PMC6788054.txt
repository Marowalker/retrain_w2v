Some chemical substances could improve
the sorption capacity of
biochars. In this paper, sodium humate was introduced to the pyrolysis
of two biomass samples at 600 °C, and sodium humate–biochars
have been successfully synthesized. The surface area and surface
morphologies of all of the biochars were characterized, and the results
indicated that sodium humate–biochars have higher surface areas,
and sodium humate particles were grown on the surfaces of the biochars.
Adsorption isotherm and kinetics of methylene blue (MB) onto the biochars
were carried out by batch adsorption experiments. The results suggested
that incorporation of sodium humate could increase the adsorption
capacity of MB onto the biochars (from 10.79 to 16.21, 8.62 to 11.03
mg/g for peanut shells and white clover residues, respectively). The
adsorption experimental results also suggest that the adsorption process
of MB onto sodium humate–biochars is controlled by both intraparticle
diffusion and film diffusion. As a whole, this work probes the possibility
of sodium humate to modify the surface of biochar and improve its
adsorption ability with contaminants.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, a variety of
synthetic dyes have been developed and used
in the textile industry.1,2 Given the complicated
structure and high molecular weight, the synthetic dyes are toxic
and nonbiodegradable.3−6 Every year, many dyes are discharged into wastewater, which are
discharged directly into lakes and rivers, threatening the survival
of aquatic life.7 Therefore, water pollution
has become an increasingly serious concern. In recent years, adsorption
approaches have been widely used to remove dyes from wastewater because
of their high decolorization capacities.8 Several adsorbents such as activated carbon, sludge, fly ash, polymeric
resins, and bentonite clay have been reported to be effective adsorbent
materials for plenty of dyes.9−13 However, high price or low regeneration ability is the shortcoming,
restricting the usage of these materials. Therefore, adsorbents with
high adsorption capacity, high regeneration ability, and low cost
should be developed.

Biochar, produced from the pyrolysis of
inexpensive agricultural
and forest residues, has been widely used as an alternative low-cost
adsorbent to treat environmental pollution.14−19 Several research studies also indicated that some methods can be
used to modify the biochars and enhance their sorption capacity for
various chemical contaminants.20,21 For instance, the clay-implanted
biochar has unique properties and functions inherited from both clay
and biochar and has a much higher sorption ability to methylene blue
(MB) than the original char.22,23 Some technologies incorporating
engineered nanoparticles into biochar have been reported to improve
the sorption ability to contaminants.24−26 Chitosan was reported
as a dispersing and soldering reagent to attach fine ZVI particles
onto bamboo biochar surfaces, and the composite biochar showed enhanced
ability to sorb heavy metals and MB from aqueous solutions.27 Therefore, these reports do suggest that modification
with some chemical substances could improve the sorption capacity
of biochars.

Sodium humate (SH) is a water-soluble sodium salt
of humic acid
that is widespread in nature. It can be derived from extraction of
lignite and peat.28 They have been reported
to be widely used in biological farming and pollution treatment because
of their capacity of adsorption, chelation, and ion-exchange.29−34 However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports
regarding the application of SH to modify the surface of biochars,
thus improving the sorption capacity. Therefore, the main objective
of this work was to probe the possibility of SH to modify the surface
of biochar and improve its adsorption ability with contaminants.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Biochars
2.1.1 SEM Analysis
The scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of the surface morphologies of the raw and
SH-modified biochars are shown in Figure 1. The images for all of the biochars suggested
that the samples had rough surfaces because of the intrinsic nature
of the biochar matrix. However, compared with the raw peanut shell
and white clover biochar, the surfaces of SH-modified biochars were
covered with some prills. Although the prills on the surface of SH–PS
were not homogeneous, some granules were still found on the biochar
surface, which is different from that of raw PS biochar, indicating
that SH was grown on the biochar surface.

and SH-modified biochars. (a) PS biochar;
(b) SH–PS biochar; (c) WC biochar; (d) SH–WC biochar.

2.1.2 Specific Surface Area
and PSD
In
order to study the influence of SH to the pyrolysis of biomass, the
specific surface area and pore size distribution (PSD) of raw and
SH-modified biochars were determined. Amongst, the specific surface
area were investigated via the N2 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) adsorption method. The results are listed in Table 1.

Table 1 BET Surface
Areas of Raw and SH-Modified
Samples
sample	BET/m2/g	
PS	217.49	
SH–PS	280.47	
WC	12.02	
SH–WC	37.28	
According to the BET results, raw
PS and WC biochars showed low
surface area (217.49 and 12.02 m2/g, respectively). In
contrast, both biomass samples treated with SH yielded higher surface
areas (280.47 m2/g for SH–PS, and 37.28 m2/g for SH–WC). Therefore, SH could increase the surface area
of the biochars.

The PSD of raw and SH-modified PS and WC biochar
samples was calculated
by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method and shown
in Figure 2. The results
indicated that PS, SH–PS, WC, and SH–WC have PSDs that
extend in the mesopore region, and dV/dDs of SH-modified biochars were higher than those of raw biochars.
This would imply that mesopore volumes of SH-modified biochars were
significantly greater those that of raw biochars.

and SH-modified PS and WC biochars.

2.2 Adsorption Properties of Biochars
The capacity of the biochars to remove MB from aqueous solution was
measured by the adsorption isotherm and kinetics.

2.2.1 Equilibrium
Adsorption Isotherms
Equilibrium adsorption isotherm experiments
were conducted at concentrations
ranging from 1 to 200 mg/L of MB, with 10 mL of solution and 20 mg
of biochars. Four isotherm models such as Langmuir, Freundlich, Langmuir–Freundlich,
and Redlich–Peterson fitting to the experimental data were
carried out, and their nonlinear equations were expressed as follows 1   2   3   4  where Ce (mg/L)
and qe (mg/g) are the equilibrium concentration
and the amount of MB adsorbed by biochars, respectively. Kl (L/g), Kf (mg(1–n) Ln g–1), Klf (Ln mg–n), and Kr (L/g) are the isotherm constants of Langmuir, Freundlich,
Langmuir–Freundlich, and Redlich–Peterson models, respectively. Q (mg/g) is the maximum adsorption capacity. All the plots
are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Adsorption isotherm data and modeling for MB on biochars: (a) PS;
(b) SH–PS; (c) WC; and (d) SH–WC.

The isotherm parameters and the correlation coefficient values
(R2) are listed in Table 2.

 	n	0.772	0.886	0.730	2.234	
 	R2	0.941	0.969	0.895	0.935	
The fitted data listed in Table 2 suggested that the
Freundlich isotherm model best
described the experimental data of MB on PS and WC biochars with R2 values of 0.955 and 0.920, respectively, from
which the adsorption of MB onto PS and WC biochars could be described
by multilayer adsorption onto the heterogeneous surface. Different
from raw PS and WC biochars, the equilibrium data of MB on SH–PS
and SH–WC fitted the Redlich–Peterson isotherm model
with R2 values of 0.969 and 0.935, respectively.
Because the Redlich–Peterson isotherm model is an empirical
equation that combines elements from both Langmuir and Freundlich
equations, so it does not follow ideal monolayer adsorption and is
assumed to a hybrid adsorption on the heterogeneous surface. Therefore,
the fitting results indicated that the adsorption of MB onto SH–PS
and SH–WC was a hybrid chemical reaction–sorption process
on the heterogeneous surface.

In general, the maximum adsorption
capacities for SH–PS
and SH–WC are 16.21 and 11.03 mg/g, respectively, which are
higher than raw biochars. That is to say, SH can improve the adsorption
capacity of the biochars, which is consistent with the surface area
observed above.

2.2.2 Adsorption Kinetics
Adsorption
kinetics tests were conducted to evaluate the removal rate and adsorption
mechanism of MB by raw and SH-modified biochars. As shown in Figure 3, the adsorption
amount of MB increased rapidly in the first 60 min, and then, the
MB adsorption capacity increased slowly and reached equilibrium.

In order to study the adsorption mechanism of MB onto biochars, the
adsorption kinetic data were analyzed by pseudo–first-order
kinetics, pseudo-second-order kinetics model, and Elovich model, which
are shown as follows 5   6   7  

In these three adsorption kinetic models, qe and qt describe
the amounts of MB adsorbed by the biochars at equilibrium and at time
(t), respectively. k1 and k2 are the kinetic rate constants,
respectively. α and β are the initial adsorption rate
and the desorption constant, respectively. The values of the kinetics
parameters of MB adsorption onto the biochars were calculated based
on the kinetic plots (Figure 4) and are given in Table 3 with corresponding correlation coefficients.

SH–WC	0.031	1.795	0.538	0.026	1.890	0.778	2.032	5.096	0.944	
As shown in Table 3, among the three
adsorption kinetics models tested, the adsorption
kinetics data of MB onto biochars satisfied the Elovich model with
the highest R2 in the range of 0.942–0.989.
Because the Elovich kinetic model was developed by Zeldowitsch35 and assumed that the solid adsorbent surface
is energetically heterogeneous, combined with the results of adsorption
isotherm for the biochars discussed above, the MB adsorption onto
raw and SH-pretreated biochars might be a combination of various adsorption
processes.

Many research studies have reported that the whole
adsorption process
of dye onto biochars can be divided into surface adsorption, intraparticle
diffusion, and equilibrium stages. Among all of the stages, the intraparticle
diffusion stage is a dominant step. In order to understand the adsorption
process better, the intraparticle diffusion model (eq 8) was used to describe the diffusion
mechanisms. 8  where qt is the amount of MB adsorbed
by the biochars at time (t), Ki and t are the slope and
intercept of the linear plot of q versus t1/2, respectively.
The linearized plots of qt versus t1/2 for the adsorption of MB
onto all the biochars were obtained and shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Plots of qt against t0.5 of MB onto biochars: (a) PS; (b) WC; (c)
SH–PS; (d) SH–WC.

As shown in Figure 5, there are two lines in the linear relationship between qt and the square root of time.
The first line attributed to instantaneous adsorption or external
surface adsorption, where MB adsorbed from aqueous solutions toward
the external surface of the biochars, and the second attributed to
the particle diffusion, where adsorbed MB travels within the pores
of the biochars.36,37 As can be seen in Figure 5, the fitting lines of intraparticle
diffusion were off the origin, that is to say, the fitting lines have
intercepts, indicating that intraparticle diffusion was not the only
rate-controlling step, and film diffusion was also the rate-limiting
steps of the adsorption process.

2.2.3 Regeneration
and Adsorption Mechanism
The evaluation of regeneration of
the biochar adsorbent is vital
for the selection in practical applications, therefore, a regeneration
study was carried out to evaluate the cyclic performance of SH–PS
as a model biochar adsorbent. The results are presented in Figure 6. It can be clearly
seen that the regenerated biochar adsorbent can adsorb about 14.00
mg/g MB after each regeneration cycle, and the adsorption capacity
remained 86.92% of the initial adsorption capacity after four cycles,
reflecting that good regenerability was realized for SH–PS.
Therefore, SH-modified biochars can be used as an effective absorbent
to remove MB from water after repeated treatment.

Figure 6 Regeneration and cycle
performance of SH–PS.

In conclusion, SH could increase the sorption capacities of biochars.
This can be explained from the characteristic of SH, which is composed
of some functional groups, such as carboxyl and hydroxyl, and hydroxyl
is reported to increase the active sites of biochars.38,39 Meanwhile, sodium is also reported to act as catalysts and enhance
the overall pyrolysis process.40,41 Moreover, particle
diffusion is the crucial step of the MB adsorption, and mesopores
provide channels for the diffusion of adsorbents. As discussed above,
the mesopore volumes of SH-modified biochars were higher than that
of the raw biochars, which make the great contribution to the adsorption
capacities. Therefore, SH played a significant promoting effect in
the sorption capacity of biochars.

3 Conclusions
The SH-modified biochars were synthesized by pyrolysis of peanut
shell and white clover at 600 °C, and the comparison of adsorption
capacities of raw and SH-modified biochars was studied. The results
demonstrated that SH-modified biochars have much higher MB adsorption
capacities, which is consistent with the result of the surface area.
The adsorption kinetic study indicated that MB sorption to SH-modified
biochars could be dominated by multiple mechanisms, and both intraparticle
diffusion and film diffusion are the rate-limiting steps of the adsorption
process. Therefore, SH–biochars can be used as an economically
efficient adsorbent for removing MB from wastewater.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
During
our work, two agricultural
residues are chosen as biomass materials: peanut shells and white
clover residues.

Peanut is an important crop that is worldwide
cultivated and brings large economic benefit, making the ability to
convert amounts of peanut shells to a useable byproduct essential
to improving the environmental burden of this crop. Peanuts were purchased
from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. White clover is a perennial
leguminous grass, which is widely planted in the world. White clover
residues were obtained from the park nearby the school, Jiangsu, China.
The obtained peanut shells and white clover residues were washed with
deionized water and dried in the oven.

The two biomass samples
were dried in an oven at 80 °C and
grinded into 150–180 μm. SH at a purity of 99% was selected
as an additive for the experiments, which was purchased from a local
medical station.

The SH solution was prepared by dissolving
0.43 g of SH in 3 mL
deionized water. Each 4.13 g of the ground peanut shells or white
clover residues was immersed into the SH aqueous solution and stirred
for 1 h. The mixture of biomass and SH was then dried in the oven
at 85 °C to remove water. Finally, the samples were stored in
desiccators until treated or for further analysis.

4.2 Biochar Production and Characterization
The raw and
SH-treated biomass samples were placed in a porcelain
boat in a 2″ MTI tube furnace. The samples were heated in 100
mL/min flowing high purity N2 to 600 °C at 5 °C/min
and held for 1 h. After pyrolysis, the solid samples were cooled to
room temperature under N2 and removed from the furnace.
The resulting raw and SH-modified biochars were labeled as PS, WC,
SH–PS, and SH–WC.

The specific surface area and
PSD of all the obtained biochars were performed with a Quantachrome
Autosorb-iQ analyzer using the N2 adsorption method over
a partial pressure range of 0.05–0.3, and the samples were
degassed at 180 °C for 18 h. The PSD was calculated by the BJH
method. The surface morphologies of the biochars were recorded by
a Quanta 250 field-emission scanning electron microscope.

4.3 Adsorption Experiments
Standard MB
adsorption kinetics and isotherm experiments were used to investigate
the capacity of the biochars to remove MB from water. The MB sorption
capacity of the biochars was examined using a 1:500 (0.02 g biochar
in 10 mL solution) at room temperature. The initial MB concentrations
for isotherm analysis ranged from 1 to 200 mg/L. The vials were agitated
at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker for 48 h, and then the samples were
immediately separated to determine MB concentrations using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (MAPADA UV-1800PC) at 665 nm. The adsorption capacity
of the biochars to MB at equilibrium was determined, according to
the formula 1. Adsorption
kinetics were examined using a 100 mg/L MB aqueous solution and time
intervals of 5, 10, 20, 30 min and 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 48 h. All
experimental treatments were performed in duplicate, and the average
values are reported. 9  where qe (mg/g)
is the adsorption equilibrium capacity of the biochar, C0 (mg/L) is the initial concentration of the MB aqueous
solution, Ce (mg/L) is the equilibrium
concentration of MB, m (g) is the weight of the biochar,
and V (mL) is the volume of the MB aqueous solution.

4.4 Regeneration Experiments
SH-modified
biochar absorbent regeneration experiments were carried out by using
MB saturated SH-modified biochars obtained from adsorption isotherm
experiments after separating the supernatant MB solution. The biochar
adsorbents were rinsed with DI water several times. The resulting
absorbent was then desorbed in HCl solution (20 mL, 0.1 mol/L) for
60 min, which followed with neutralization by NaOH solution (20 mL,
0.1 mol/L) to pH = 7. Finally, the biochar adsorbent was washed three
times with DI water and then separated and dried at 80 °C for
further MB sorption test with the same method described above. This
sorption–regeneration experiment was repeated three times,
and the average values are reported.
