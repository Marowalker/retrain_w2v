Here, we report that the trimetallic
nanosized oxide NiFeMnO4 consists of a mixture of NiO and
a strained cubic spinel
phase, which is clearly demonstrated by analysis of the pair distribution
function (PDF) and synchrotron X-ray data. Such a finding can easily
be overlooked by using only inhouse X-ray powder diffraction, leading
to inaccurate assumption of the stoichiometry and oxidation states.
Such advanced characterization is essential because a homogeneous
distribution of the elements is observed in energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy maps, giving no hints for a phase separation. Cycling
of the sample against Li delivers a high reversible capacity of ≈840
mAh/g in the 50th cycle. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
experiments indicate that ≈0.8 Li/fu is consumed without detectable
changes of the electronic structure. Increasing amounts of Li, Mn3+, and Fe3+ are simultaneously reduced. The disappearance
of the pre-edge features in X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy
indicates movement of these cations from tetrahedral sites to octahedral
sites. PDF analysis of the pattern after an uptake of 2 Li/fu evidences
that the principal structure can be sufficiently well modeled assuming
coexisting NiO, a mixed monoxide, and a small amount of residual spinel
phase. Thus, the majority of cations is located on octahedral sites.
Furthermore, an improvement of the PDF model is achieved taking into
account small amounts of LiOH. The 7Li MAS NMR spectrum
of this sample clearly shows the signal of Li in a diamagnetic environment,
excluding Li–O–TM bonds. A further increase of the Li
content leads to a successive conversion of the cations to nanosized
metal particles embedded in a LiOH/Li2O matrix. Ex situ
XAS results indicate that Fe can be reversibly reoxidized to Fe3+ during charge whereas Mn does not reach the oxidation state
observed in the pristine material. After excessive cycling, reoxidation
of metallic Ni is suppressed and contributes to a capacity loss
compared with the early discharge/charge cycles.

1 Introduction
Lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) deliver electricity in portable electronic
devices.1−5 Many efforts were undertaken during the last decades, resulting
in improvements of the capacity, safety, and cyclability of LIBs.6,7 In commercial LIBs, Ni- and/or Co-containing oxides are used as
cathodes and carbon as anode. During discharge, Li+ ions
are intercalated in the oxidic host material (cathode) and during
charge, the ions move into graphitic anode material. The intercalation
and deintercalation processes with less than 1 Li/fu being shuttled
between the electrodes lead to relatively low specific capacities.
This low specific capacity has intensified the research in the field
of LIBs, and conversion reactions were identified as a possible alternative
reaction mechanism to obtain a high capacity.

A number of transition-metal
(TM) oxides were identified as conversion
materials that can deliver capacities of more than 1000 mAh/g.8−12 These materials also fulfill requirements concerning price, abundance,
toxicity, and sustainability. Studies of such conversion materials
date back to the last century and were mainly performed by Goodenough
and colleagues.13,14 The great success of intercalation
LIBs led to a significant decline of the research on conversion electrodes.
For several years now, the worldwide debate about renewable energy
sources and especially the need for large-scale energy storage devices
as well as LIBs with larger capacities has caused a renaissance in
this field of battery research.1,2,8,9,15−20

In a number of investigations, it was demonstrated that nanoparticles
improve the electrochemical performance due to shorter diffusion pathways
and packing of the particles, leading to hollow spaces to compensate
the volume changes associated with conversion reactions.21−23

Although a large number of binary TM oxides were studied in
LIB
conversion reactions, investigations using spinel oxides with three
transition metals are scarce. The two spinel oxides NiFe2O4 and NiMn2O4 exhibit high theoretical
and experimental reversible capacities as anode materials in LiBs.20,24−30 NiFe2O4 crystallizes in an inverse spinel
structure ([AIII]tet[BII]oktO4–[FeIII][NiIIFeII]O4), whereas the distribution of the cations is known
to be more complex in the case of NiMn2O4 due
to phonon-assisted hopping of charge carriers and disproportionation
of Mn3+ according to ([Ni1–yIIMnyII][NiyIIMn2(1–y)IIIMnyIV]O4).31,32 As a consequence of the strong octahedral site preference of Ni2+, this latter spinel phase seems to be less stable and prone
to decomposition.31 Moreover, due to an
appreciable amount of the Jahn–Teller ion Mn3+ on
the B site, Mn3+ containing spinels often exhibit a tetragonal
distortion and the symmetry is reduced (Fd3̅m → I41/amd). Larson et al. proposed a
critical concentration of Mn3+ of 58–65% above which
a tetragonal symmetry reduction occurs.29,33−35 This value can be reduced by substituting of Fe3+ for
Mn3+. The first report about NiMnFeO4 nanoparticles
(<100 nm) as anode material showed a reversible capacity of 750
mAh/g after 50 cycles, comparable to the performance of NiFe2O4 and even better than that of NiMn2O4.36

In the past few years,
we investigated the reaction mechanisms
of Li uptake and release of nanocrystalline spinels using operando
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS), accompanied by ex situ techniques, like galvanostatic cycling,
NMR spectroscopy, cyclovoltammetry, high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM), and elemental analysis.37−42

The combination of these techniques allowed elucidation of
detailed
reaction mechanisms on different structural length scales and the
changes of the electronic structures. For all materials, we observed
formation of a monoxide with a NaCl-type structure after conversion
of about 2 Li/fu. From a thermodynamic point of view, the formation
of mixed transition-metal monoxides is surprising because for several
combinations of metal cations, elevated temperatures are required
for their formation.43 The NaCl-like structure
is realized by simultaneous reduction of the M3+ cations
to M2+ and movement of M2+ to empty octahedral
sites. In addition, O2– anions must be expelled
and most probably Li2O is formed. Increasing the Li content
leads to a successive further reduction of the cations to the metallic
state (exception: Mg2+ in MgFe2O4 could not be reduced) and after full discharge, metallic nanoparticles
are embedded in a Li2O matrix. During the charge process,
the metallic particles are oxidized and amorphous or nanocrystalline
oxides are formed.

In situ/operando XRD investigations probe
the formation of new
crystalline phases on the long-range scale, and the local environment
and the changes of the electronic properties can be investigated using
in situ/operando XAS experiments.37−41 Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis allows
characterization of nanosized materials from the atomic to the nanometer
scale, thus complementing XRD and XAS.42 The results achieved by such experiments are complemented by ex
situ characterizations, thus finally leading to a detailed picture
of reaction mechanisms of the complex conversion reactions taking
place during Li uptake/release.

In the manuscript, we report
on results of our investigations on
NiMnFeO4 nanoparticles used as anode material for LiBs.
The focus of the study is the clarification of the structural and
electronic reaction mechanisms. Therefore, Li uptake/release of NiMnFeO4 was investigated in detail by operando XRD and XAS, ex situ 7Li MAS NMR, XRD, PDF, XAS, and TEM. The electrochemical performance
of the material was characterized using galvanostatic cycling and
cyclic voltammetry (CV).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Characterization
The X-ray
powder pattern of the as-prepared NiMnFeO4 nanoparticles
is presented in Figure 1. Although the general appearance of the pattern agrees with that
of a typical cubic spinel structure, Rietveld refinement was not satisfactory
and pronounced deviations of the relative intensities could be observed.
As a second phase, NiO (rock salt structure) was added in the refinement
and the refined lattice parameter of a = 4.1675(1)
Å is in good agreement with literature data (aICSD28834 = 4.170 Å). In addition, it was necessary
to introduce a strain parameter for the spinel phase for adequate
modeling the powder pattern (Table S1).
From the refinement, the sizes of coherently scattering domains were
17(1) nm for the spinel and 11(1) nm for NiO.

Figure 1 X-ray powder diffraction
pattern of NiMnFeO4 nanoparticles
(black) with Rietveld Fit (red) and difference calculation (blue)
and the calculated pattern of spinel (gold), corresponding to the
schematic structure, and NiO (green), both shifted to a lower intensity
for the sake of clarity. Measured at beamline P02.1, DESY using 60
keV (λ = 0.2073 Å).

The occurrence of alternating spinel and rock salt domains
in solid
solutions of rock salt and spinel samples was discussed by Armbruster.44 In addition, rock salt and defect rock salt-type
impurities, i.e., NiO, Ni0.5Mn0.5O, or Ni6MnO8, were reported several times in these and
closely related compounds.31,45−48 Nevertheless, due to the uniform cation distribution, revealed by
TEM-energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping analysis, it can be assumed
that a domain intergrowth as described in ref (33) is more likely than a
phase separation.

The amount of NiO was estimated on the basis
of Rietveld refinement
to be ∼23 wt % (Table S1). Therefore,
the stoichiometry of the spinel must deviate from its desired value,
and the stoichiometry was determined on the basis of the work by Feltz
and Pölzl:31 1  Assuming aNiO =
0.48 mol
%, the stoichiometry of the spinel should be Fe1.19IIINi0.61IIMn0.38IIMn0.81IIIO4.

Total scattering experiments
allowed an even more accurate understanding
of the structure. In Figure 2, the local structure of two models is compared with the resulting
PDF. Model I: the cubic spinel, derived by Rietveld refinement; model
II: a tetragonally distorted spinel (space group I41/amd) combined
with the presence of cubic NiO. As can be seen in Figure 2, the local PDF is more precisely
described by model II. In a Rietveld-like approach, the lattice parameters
of the spinel were determined as a = 5.952(4) Å
and c = 8.29(1) Å, with a c/a ratio of 1.392 significantly deviating from the
ideal value of 1.4142 = √2 expected for cubic symmetry. We
note that Rwp values for different models
do not allow a resolute decision on what model is correct, because
these values can be lowered simply by introducing more parameters
to the fit. But many features in the PDF are clearly better described
using model II and should therefore be a more suitable description
of the local structure (Figure 2, right).

Figure 2 Comparison of two models with PDF obtained from total
scattering
experiments at beamline P02.1, DESY. The cubic model on the left shows
enhanced deviations compared with the tetragonal model on the right.
The Rwp value determined by a Rietveld-like
least square refinement is lower for the tetragonal model, indicating
a more suitable description of the local structure.

As mentioned above, the reduction of cubic symmetry
to tetragonal
was reported for several manganese-containing spinels29,33−35 and is a consequence of the Jahn–Teller effect
of the Mn3+ ions located on tetrahedral and/or octahedral
sites. On a tetrahedral site, the degeneracy of the d4 electronic
configuration is removed, leading to a flattening of the MnO4 tetrahedron whereas for Mn3+ on an octahedral site, an
elongation of MnO6 octahedra is expected. We note that
NiMnFeO4 adopts cubic symmetry if the sample was prepared
at higher temperatures.36,49,50 Remarkably, a Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern using the tetragonal
model yielded no improvement of the refinement (better R value). This emphasizes that the tetragonal distortion is a local
phenomenon and is averaged out into a strained yet still cubic symmetry
on a global scale. The results of PDF and Rietveld refinements are
compared in Table S1.

As mentioned
in the introduction, Larson et al. determined the
critical concentration of Mn3+ on the octahedral B site
to be ∼58–65%.35 This value
is significantly larger than the ≈41% Mn3+ assigned
to the spinel in this study and may explain why the tetragonal distortion
is merely a local phenomenon.

TEM-EDX experiments were performed
to verify that the elements
are evenly distributed over a large area of the sample. Hence, data
were measured at four different positions of the NiMnFeO4 sample, yielding Mn, 35.5 atom %; Fe, 32.4 atom %; and Ni, 32.1
atom % (Supporting Information Table S2), which is close to the desired composition. We note that no region
could be found where the composition significantly deviated from the
data listed in Table S2.

Agglomerated
particles with sizes in the range of 8–12 nm
were observed, which represent the number-weighted average and are
therefore smaller than the volume-weighted mean obtained by Rietveld
refinement of XRD data (Table S1). The
HRTEM micrograph (Figure 3, top left) depicts a respective agglomeration of particles
that feature a crystalline character, and the corresponding selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 3, top right) can be assigned to the cubic
spinel phase (space group Fd3̅m, Supporting Information Table S3). Pristine
NiMnFeO4 nanoparticles were analyzed by TEM-EDX mapping
(Figure 3, bottom)
demonstrating a homogeneous dispersion of Ni, Mn, Fe, and O.

NiMnFeO4 nanoparticles, STEM-EDX maps at O, Ni, Mn, and
Fe K edge in a 0.6 × 1.0 μm2 area.

2.2 Electrochemical Performance
The electrochemical
performance of the NiMnFeO4 nanoparticles was determined
with galvanostatic cycling in a potential range from 0.1 to 3.0 V
(Figure 4). The capacity
for the first discharge amounts to 1427 mAh/g, which is larger than
the theoretical value (918 mAh/g). This observation is a common feature
for transition-metal oxides and is explained by formation of a solid
electrolyte interphase (SEI), formation of a gel-type layer on metal
nanoparticles upon deep discharge,8,51−53 and/or interfacial storage of Li.54 During
the first discharge, the voltage decreases until about 3 Li/fu are
consumed. Further Li uptake is accompanied by a flat voltage region
at 0.7 V, which is typical for a two-phase reaction. The observation
of only one plateau instead of three, which may be expected from different
potentials, indicates simultaneous reduction of the cations. After
uptake of 9 Li/fu, a sloping region follows up to the discharge limit
of 0.1 V. The first charge curve significantly differs from the first
discharge curve, which is a typical feature of conversion reactions.
The capacity slightly decreases during the first 10 cycles (Figure 4b) and is stable
at about 830 mAh/g during the next 40 cycles (Figure 4b).

Figure 4 Electrochemical performance of NiMnFeO4 nanoparticles
in a potential range from 0.1 to 3 V: (a) potential curves during
galvanostatic, 115 mAh/g ≈ 1 Li cycling, (b) capacity of galvanostatic
cycling during the first 50 cycles, (c) capacity during cycling at
different currents, and (d) cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a potential
range from 0 to 3.2 V, with a sweep rate of 0.1 mV/s.

The reversible capacity for the first cycle of
885 mAh/g (capacity
loss 38%) is close to the theoretical value for phase pure NiMnFeO4 of 918 mAh/g. With the phases discussed above, which are
slightly oxygen deficient compared with a phase pure spinel (0.48
mol % NiO, 0.84 mol % Fe1.19IIINi0.61IIMn0.38IIMn0.81IIIO4), the experimental reversible
capacity is even closer to the theoretical value of 893 mAh/g. Discharging
and charging of the material at different currents (different C rates)
is displayed in Figure 4c. For the C/10 rate, the capacity is about 830 mAh/g and an increase
of the current leads to lower values: C/5 ≈ 700 mAh/g, C/2
≈ 550 mAh/g, 1C ≈ 450 mAh/g, and 2C ≈ 380 mAh/g.
After fast cycling at 2C, the material is still intact and the capacity
reaches ≈700 mAh/g for the cycles 50–60 applying a C/10
rate.

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves measured in a potential
range
from 3.2 to 0 V are presented in Figure 4d. A characteristic feature of conversion-type
materials is the pronounced difference between the first and subsequent
cycles. In the first discharge curve, a strong anodic signal is observed
at about 0.5 V and the first charge curve exhibits not well-resolved
weak cathodic signals between about 1.2 and 2.3 V. In the second discharge
curve, the anodic event shifted to 0.7 V and shows a clearly reduced
intensity. A further slight shift to 0.8 V of this signal is observed
in the following discharge curves, whereas the charge curves are characterized
by weak and broad signals.

2.3 Operando XAS
The
potential curve
recorded during the first discharge of the in situ XAS cell is shown
in Figure 5, which
is similar to that observed in the galvanostatic measurement with
Swagelok-type cells (see Section 2.2). The lower capacity is caused by the construction
of the cell: for experimental reasons, no spring could be used in
the in situ cell and therefore a small part of the material is electrochemically
inactive.

Figure 5 Potential curve of the in situ XAS cell.

The X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) obtained at
the
Mn, Fe, and Ni K edges are depicted in Figure 6. For absorber atoms in a centrosymmetric
environment, a pre-edge signal is very weak, because the 1s →
3d transition is dipole-forbidden but quadrupole-allowed. In a non-centrosymmetric
environment, hybridization of 3d and 4p orbitals is possible, thus
adding some p-character to the 3d orbitals. In this situation, a pre-edge
feature appears in the XANES spectra. Because pre-edge signals are
only observed at the K edges of Mn and Fe, it can be assumed that
both Mn3+ and Fe3+ cations are located on tetrahedral
sites. A distribution of Mn3+/Fe3+ over the
two sites was reported for cubic NiMnFeO4 synthesized at
elevated temperatures.36,49,50 Although the occupation pattern of the sites seems to be obvious,
the ratio of Mn3+ and Fe3+ on the tetrahedral
site cannot be determined using the present experimental data. In
all three spectra (Figure 6), an intense signal is observed that is due to the spin-allowed
1s → 4p transition. An assignment of oxidation states and/or
identification of the chemical composition using XANES is not straightforward
for nanosized samples, as discussed, e.g., in refs (55, 56). In addition, evaluation of the oxidation
state is not accurate because edge shifts may also arise from structural
distortions and defects.

Figure 6 Operando XAS spectra at Fe K edge (top, left),
Mn K edge (top,
right), and Ni K edge (bottom) collected during the first discharge
process. In the insets, the color codes are explained reporting the
voltage (V) and the Li content (Lix) according to the discharge profile shown in Figure 5.

At the early stages of Li uptake up to ≈0.8 Li/fu,
the spectra
are not affected (blue lines in the spectra in Figure 6). Increasing continuously, the Li content
leads to a shift of the Fe and Mn K edge energies and of the signal
of the 1s → 4p transition to lower energies, indicating successive
reduction of Fe3+/Mn3+ to Fe2+/Mn2+ (Figure 6, top left and top right). The disappearance of the pre-edge feature
in the spectra of Mn and Fe is a hint that the reduced cations moved
from the tetrahedral sites to empty octahedra. Up to about 3 Li/fu,
the Ni K edge is not significantly affected and a similar observation
was made for NiFe2O468 and NiCo2O4,69 where
only minor changes of the spectral signature of the Ni K edge could
be identified.

Li uptake by the host material beyond 3 Li/fu
leads to a successive
reduction of the intensity of the 1s → 4p signal and a further
shift of the edge energies to lower values, indicating reduction of
the transition-metal cations. Furthermore, a pre-edge feature occurs
in all spectra, which is typical for the metallic state. A rotation
around isosbestic points occurs, which are located at 6545 eV for
Mn, 7123 eV for Fe, and 8341 eV for Ni, suggesting no intermediate
reaction steps during reduction of the cations.

2.4 Operando XRD
Operando XRD investigations
enable observations of structural changes on the long-range order
and formation of new crystalline phases. Figure 7 shows the XRD patterns recorded during uptake
of 2 Li/fu.

Figure 7 Operando XRD powder pattern during uptake of the first 2 Li/fu
(left). The two reflections of metallic Cu are caused by the cell
setup. Potential of the in situ cell (upper right). Schematic picture
of structural changes during Li uptake (lower right).

During uptake of the first 0.5 Li/fu, the position
of the reflections
is not affected (Figure 7) and first indications of structural changes can be observed as
shoulders on the lower scattering angle side of the reflections for
≈0.7–0.8 Li/fu. This observation is in accordance with
the results of XANES experiments discussed in the previous section.
The shoulders in the XRD patterns clearly develop into Bragg reflections
with increasing Li content, and at 2 Li/fu, it seems that two phases
coexist. In principle, the reflections of elemental Cu can be used
as an internal standard for Rietveld refinements of the powder patterns.
But a buckling of the cell caused deviations of the relative peak
positions from their theoretical values, thus preventing reliable
refinements of the operando data. Therefore, additional ex situ XRD
and PDF measurements of a sample after uptake of 2 Li/fu were collected
to elucidate the structural behavior. The XRD pattern reveals the
existence of two rock salt monoxide phases, NiO (a = 4.1872(2) Å) and another rock salt monoxide, whose lattice
parameter indicates the presumably mixed monoxide (NiMnFe)O with a = 4.2809(3) Å (for comparison: FeO ICSD 27854 a = 4.308 Å; MnO ICSD 18006 a = 4.480
Å; NiO ICSD 28834 a = 4.170 Å), but the
spinel phase is also present (Figures 7 and S1). Nevertheless,
the PDF demonstrates that all major features of the local region can
be sufficiently well described by a model consisting of the above-mentioned
mixed monoxide and NiO only (Figure 8 and Table S4).

Figure 8 PDF of a sample
after uptake of 2 Li/fu obtained from total scattering
experiments at beamline P02.1, DESY. A model comprising NiO and a
mixed (NiFeMn)O was used to calculate the PDF (red). The Rwp value was determined in a Rietveld-like least squares
refinement and is sufficiently low for PDF measurements, indicating
a suitable description of the local structure.

A closer look on the modeled PDF shows that some minor deviations
are still present (Figure 8), suggesting that the model still exhibits some inaccuracies.
Initially, several defect monoxide phases, like Ni6MnO8, were tested but no improvement of the fit could be achieved.
Therefore, the difference function (green curve in Figure 8) was compared to modeled PDFs
of common Li compounds described in the literature (Figures 9 and S2), e.g., refs (7, 57, 58). Although often discussed as the major Li compounds
generated during SEI formation, only minor agreements with Li2O, LiF, or Li2CO3 can be observed (Figure S2) but reasonably good matches are obtained
using LiOH in the further phase.

Figure 9 Comparison of difference PDF from Figure 8 with modeled PDFs
of LiOH and Li2O. Coinciding distances of LiOH are marked
by a black dashed line,
and those of Li2O, in light gray.

The occurrence of LiOH was reported in the literature, which
is
generated by reaction between Li and an OH layer being naturally present
on nanoscopic metal oxide particles, which, e.g., were detected on
Fe3O4 nanoparticles.58,59

We also compared the PDF of the pristine material with that
measured
after uptake of 2 Li/fu (Figure S2). Pronounced
differences in positions and intensities can be seen, which are caused
by changes of the distribution of transition-metal cations over the
tetrahedral and octahedral sites: distances related to tetrahedral
sites clearly decreased and those related to octahedral sites are
more intense. This finding implies the movement of the majority of
cations from tetrahedral to octahedral sites.

Beyond 2 Li/fu,
a continuous decrease and broadening of the reflections
can be observed. At the end of discharge, all reflections disappeared
(Figure 10), suggesting
formation of amorphous materials or of particles being too small to
be detected by X-rays.

Figure 10 In situ powder diffraction pattern during uptake
of more than 2
Li/fu (left) and potential of the in situ cell during operation (right).

For nanosized spinel oxides, we
also observed that at the early
stages of Li uptake, first an amorphous layer is consumed and depending
on the material significant changes in the XRD patterns, occurring
only for LixM2O4 with x ≥ 0.3–0.5. A similar observation
was reported for Li uptake by Mn3O4.60

2.5 Ex Situ XAS
Additional
ex situ XAS
spectra were collected after 1, 2, 3, and 5 cycles (Figure 11) because operando XAS only
probed the first cycle. The spectra of the pristine material are similar
for all three K edges, as observed in the operando experiment (Figure 11, blue line). At
the end of the first discharge process, Mn3+, Fe3+, and Ni2+ are reduced and a comparison with the spectra
of the metal references reveals that the cations are reduced to the
metallic state (Figure 11, black straight and dashed line). The differences between
the spectra of the metallic foils and those of the reduced metallic
nanoparticles may be caused by the large number of atoms on the surface
of the nanoparticles, the very small particle sizes, and a high density
of defects. In addition, the nanoparticles are embedded in an oxygen-containing
matrix and the surface of the particles may be partially oxidized,
an example of these effects was reported in ref (61). After the first cycle,
the Mn K-edge energy exhibits a clear shift to lower energy, indicating
that the oxidation state observed for the pristine material is not
reached (Figure 11, top left), which may partially explain the capacity loss during
cycling.

Figure 11 Ex situ XAS spectra at Mn K edge (top, left), Fe K edge (top, right),
and Ni K edge (bottom) of pristine NiMnFeO4 (blue), after
the first discharge (black straight line) and after 1 (red), 2 (yellow),
3 (green), and 5 cycles (dark red).

In the following cycles, the Mn K-edge energy is not significantly
altered but changes are observed for the 1s → 4p transition,
which may be caused by distortions and defects in the nanosized particles.

The energy of the Fe K edge shows no pronounced differences between
the 1st and 5th cycle (Figure 11, top right), and is similar to that of the pristine
material. This observation indicates that reduction and oxidation
of Fe0 ↔ Fe3+ is reversible over many
cycles. In contrast, the Ni K edge (Figure 11, bottom) exhibits a significant reduction
of the 1s → 4p transition and the shape of the signal becomes
more and more similar to that of the metallic reference foil with
increasing number of cycles. These findings indicate that the Ni0 ↔ Ni2+ redox reaction is not stable over
many cycles and a part of Ni remains in the metallic state. This is
maybe another reason for the capacity loss during cycling (see Section 2.2).

2.6 Ex Situ 7Li MAS NMR
XAS
data yields information only about the transition metals, but no information
about the direct environment of the lithium ions is available. 7Li MAS NMR closes this gap of information. Paramagnetic ions
in the direct neighborhood of Li+ ions can have strong
effects on the NMR spectra, leading to large shift values.627Li MAS NMR spectra of NiMnFeO4 nanoparticles after uptake of 2 Li/fu and after complete
discharge are displayed in Figure 12. The spectrum measured after uptake of 2 Li/fu shows
a narrow isotropic peak close to 0 ppm (Figure 12, black) and narrow spinning sidebands.
Hence, paramagnetic neighbors in the direct environment of Li can
be excluded due to the small shift.57,63 This indicates
formation of a Li-containing phase without transition metals. The
NMR spectrum acquired after discharge to 0.1 V shows a similar shift
close to 0 ppm. Obviously, the only Li-containing phase must exhibit
a diamagnetic environment, e.g., LiOH, Li2O, or Li2CO3. But the isotropic peaks are broadened and
the width of the spinning sideband pattern is increased (Figure 12, red line). This
behavior is caused by the formation and growth of metallic Ni, Mn,
and Fe particles. Similar observations were made in prior studies
for MnFe2O4 and MgFe2O4.37,38

3 Conclusions
The true compositional
and structural nature of nanoparticles of
the intended spinel NiMnFeO4 could only be determined applying
advanced X-ray scattering techniques. According to the results of
X-ray diffraction and PDF analyses, NiMnFeO4 consists of
a mixture of a strained spinel and NiO, both being present as intergrown
nanoparticles. The estimated stoichiometry of the spinel is Fe1.19IIINi0.61IIMn0.38IIMn0.81IIIO4. The sample shows a high specific capacity of >800 mAh/g as Li
anode
material during 50 cycles. Operando XAS and XRD experiments demonstrate
that first Li is consumed without significant structural and electronic
changes. Increasing the Li/fu leads to reduction of Fe3+/Mn3+ to Fe2+/Mn2+ and the simultaneous
movement of these cations from tetrahedral sites to empty octahedral
sites. This assumption is clearly supported by comparison of the PDFs
of the pristine material and a sample containing 2 Li/fu: the signals
related to transition-metal cations on tetrahedral sites are significantly
reduced, whereas those for cations residing on octahedral sites are
increased. The detailed analysis of the PDF of the sample containing
2 Li gives hints that LiOH is formed during Li uptake. This is further
supported by 7Li NMR investigations showing a Li signal
typical for a diamagnetic environment. The analysis of the total scattering
data of the sample with 2 Li/fu presents evidences for the existence
of two monoxides, i.e., NiO and (NiMnFe)O crystallizing in a NaCl-like
structure. Further increase of the Li content leads to a successive
conversion of the cations to the metallic state, and the nanoparticles/amorphous
particles are embedded in a Li-containing matrix. The capacity loss
observed during the first few cycles can be at least partially traced
back to the inability to reoxidize metallic Mn to Mn3+ and
successively occurring inactivity of Ni nanoparticles.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis
NiFeMnO4 nanoparticles
were synthesized by dissolving 5 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (97%, Merck), 5 mmol Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (98%, Riedel-de Haen), and 5 mmol Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (98%, Grüssing)
in 20 mL of deionized water. Five milliliters of nitric acid (65%,
p.A., Grüssing) were added to the solution by stirring at room
temperature. Afterward, 10 mL of ethylene glycol (99%, Merck Millipore)
were added and the mixture was heated at 80 °C until a viscous
gel is formed. Afterward, the gel was dried at 120 °C for 24
h. The solid was ground in an agate mortar and calcined at 400 °C
in a preheated oven in air for 3 h.43

4.2 Materials Characterizations
Ex situ
XRD and total scattering patterns were collected at beamline P02.1,
Petra III, DESY, Hamburg, at a wavelength λ = 0.207 Å (60
keV) and a sample detector distance of 1100 and 385 mm, respectively.
The data were collected using a PerkinElmer XRD1621 two-dimensional
(2D) detector. The 2D data were processed using DAWN Science.64 Total scattering data were processed using xPDFsuite
to obtain the pair distribution function (Qmax 21.66 Å–1, Qdamp = 0.0215) and PDFgui for modeling and fitting the PDF.65−67 In both setups, NIST 660a LaB6 reference material was
measured to account for instrumental contributions to XRD and PDF,
respectively. To account for the contribution of the glass, an empty
capillary was measured and subtracted from the scattering data before
PDF calculation. The refinement of the XRD powder patterns was done
using Topas Academic 6.0.47

Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectra were measured in a Philips ESEM XL-30 with EDAX New
XL-30 Detecting Unit. Transmission electron microscopy investigations
were performed in a Tecnai F30 G2-STwin microscope at 300 kV with
a field emission gun cathode and a Si/Li detector (Thermo Fisher,
NSS). NiFeMnO4 nanoparticles were suspended in n-butanol and treated in an ultrasonic bath to induce particle
separation. Afterward, the dispersion was dropped onto a holey-carbon
copper grid.

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical
tests were performed in Swagelok cells. The test cells were prepared
by mixing 70 wt % active material with 20 wt % SUPER C65 Carbon (Timcal,
Switzerland) and 10 wt % sodium polyacrylate (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany).
The mixture was dissolved with deionized water, deposited on dendritic
copper foil (Schlenk, Germany), and dried at room temperature for
2 days. Afterward, 10 mm disks were cut with about 1 mg of active
material per cm2. Lithium metal (99.9%, abcr Germany) was
used as a counter electrode, glass microfiber filters (Whatman, United
Kingdom) as the separator, and a solution of 1 M LiPF6 in
an ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate mixture (BASF, Germany) as
electrolyte. The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox
(<1 ppm O2, <1 ppm H2O). Galvanostatic
experiments were performed with MTI BST8-WA, and cyclic voltammetry
was measured with a Zahner XPot. A C/10 rate corresponds to the uptake/release
of 8 Li/fu within 10 h, which is equal to 91.8 mA/g.

4.4 Operando XRD and XAS
For operando
XRD and XAS investigations, a custom-built cell (40 × 40 ×
15 mm3) consisting of two aluminum plates with rectangular
apertures (14 × 3 mm2) in the center and two sheets
of Kapton foil windows glued on both sides was used. For these investigations,
80 wt % active material was mixed with 10 wt % SUPER C65 Carbon and
10 wt % poly(vinylidene difluoride) (Solvay, Germany). The mixture
was suspended in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (99.5%,
Sigma-Aldrich) and was deposited on a thin Cu foil, followed by drying
in inert atmosphere. The counter electrode Li metal was attached on
a perforated Cu foil. As separator, a microporous polyethylene/polypropylene
membrane (Celgard) was used and the electrolyte consisted of 1 M LiPF6 in an ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate mixture.

Operando XAS experiments were performed at the XAS beamline at ANKA
(Karlsruhe, Germany). The cell was discharged with a C/12 rate during
repeated quick XAS scans at the Mn, Fe, and Ni K absorption edges.
The time for scanning each absorption edge was 5 min. Energy calibration
was done with a Fe foil before and after the experiment. Mn, Fe, and
Ni reference foils were measured between the second and third ionization
chambers. The spectra were treated in the usual way using Athena Software
package.68

Operando XRD investigations
were performed at the PDIFF beamline
at ANKA (Karlsruhe, Germany, 16 keV, λ = 0.774901 Å) with
a Princeton CCD detector. The powder patterns were collected within
5 min, and the 2D patterns were transformed with the area diffraction
machine.69

The Bragg reflection profile
of the instrument was determined using
LaB6 standard material (NIST 660a) applying identical conditions.
The cells were discharged/charged using a Biologic VSP 300 potentiostat/galvanostat.

4.5 Ex Situ XAS,  TEM and 7Li
MAS NMR of Lithiated Samples
For ex situ XAS, samples were
discharged in Swagelok-type test cells. The lithiated electrodes were
removed and glued between adhesive Kapton tape under argon atmosphere.
Afterward, samples were inserted into the in situ cells and transferred
to the beamline.

TEM measurements were performed with a Tecnai
F30 G2-STwin microscope with a field emission gun cathode
operated at 300 kV and a Si/Li detector (Thermo Fisher, NSS). For
TEM preparation, NiFeMnO4 particles were suspended in n-butanol and dropped on a holey-carbon copper grid.

The 7Li MAS NMR experiments were performed with a 2.5
mm probe on an Avance 200 MHz spectrometer using a magnetic field
of 4.7 T. The spectra were collected at an operating frequency of
77.8 MHz. A spinning frequency of 30 kHz and a rotor-synchronized
spin-echo sequence (90°−τ–180°−τ-acq.)
were used to acquire the spectra. π/2 pulses of 1 μs were
used, with recycle delay times of 1 s. All NMR spectra were referenced
to a 1 M LiCl solution, at 0 ppm.
