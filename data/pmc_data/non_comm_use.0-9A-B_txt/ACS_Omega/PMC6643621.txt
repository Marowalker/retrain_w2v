Multidrug-resistant
bacteria are one of the current biggest threats
to public health and are responsible for most nosocomial infections.
Herein, we report the efficient and facile synthesis of antibacterial
agents aminoalkylphenols, derived from 5-nitrosalicyladehyde and prepared
through a Petasis borono–Mannich multicomponent reaction. Minimum
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as low as 1.23 μM for a chlorine
derivative were determined for multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria,
namely, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, two of the main pathogens
responsible for infections in a hospital environment. The most promising
antibacterial agents were further tested against eight strains of
four Gram-positive species in order to elucidate their antibacterial
broadness. In vitro cytotoxicity assays of the most active aminoalkylphenol
revealed considerably lower toxicity against mammalian cells, as concentrations
one order of magnitude higher than the determined MICs were required
to induce human keratinocyte cell death. The phenol moiety was verified
to be important in deeming the antibacterial properties of the analyzed
compounds, although no correlation between such properties and their
antioxidant activity was observed. A density functional theory computational
study substantiated the ability of aminoalkylphenols to serve as precursors
of ortho-quinone methides.

Introduction
The discovery and development
of antibiotics stands as one of mankind’s
greatest achievements. However, the number of infections provoked
by multidrug-resistant bacteria is increasing at a remarkable pace,
a problem that science has not been able to address.1 The unrestrained use of antibiotics in the last 50 years
has been advocated as one of the reasons for the colonization and
infection due to drug resistant bacteria.2,3 It
is estimated that in Europe and the United States, 48 000 people
die each year because of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections,4 and that in 2016, there were 600 000 worldwide
cases with resistance to rifampicin, of which 490 000 had multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis.5 If no actions are taken
to tackle this severe public health issue, it is foreseen that by
2050, the death toll can rise up to 10 million lives when considering
drug resistance of only six pathogens.6 This is even more alarming in the hospital environment or other
health care facilities, where acquired infections are associated with
significant morbidity and mortality, additional health care expenditure,
greater use of broad spectrum antibiotics (which amplifies the emergence
and reemergence of drug resistant microorganisms), and increased costs.7 According to WHO estimates, of every hundred
hospitalized patients, 7 in developed and 10 in developing countries
will acquire at least one nosocomial infection.8 Besides intrinsic patient factors (age, duration of hospitalization,
or underlying diseases), many extrinsic factors, such as caregivers’
practices, surgical operations, the use of invasive devices, administration
of broad-spectrum antibiotics, or immunosuppressive agents, are risk
predisposers to these infections.9,10 The majority
of nosocomial infections are caused by bacteria, with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia
coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus spp. leading.11 Despite the society being in urgent need for new antibacterial agents,
the small fraction of yearly revenue per patient generated by such
agents when compared with anticancer drugs have pushed the pharmaceutical
companies away from their research and development programs on antibiotics.12,13 Opportunely, the development of antibiotics has been relaunched
by small biotech companies, and alternatives to antibiotics, including
“non-compound” approaches and small molecule “resistance
breakers”, are growing trends in the field.14

Motivated by the antimicrobial activity of salicylaldehydes15−17 and their Schiff bases,18 we have recently
reported the preparation and antimicrobial screening of several aminoalkylphenols.19 From screening of a library of 43 compounds,
some structural features pivotal for the antibacterial activity have
been identified, namely, indoline as the amine counterpart and a para-nitrophenol group. Promising antibacterial activity
against several resistant microorganisms such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci
(VRE), as well as other nonpathogenic Gram-positive strains, was reported
for some of such derivatives. Notwithstanding the fact that aminoalkylphenols
can be problematic compounds in high-throughput screenings because
of their ability to form reactive quinone methides or acting as metal
chelators,20,21 their anticancer and cytotoxic
properties continue to be extensively explored.22,23 Almost simultaneously to our report, Roman and co-workers reported
the antibacterial properties of 1-aminoalkyl 2-naphthols, in which
similar properties were observed against Gram-positive bacteria.24 Somewhat different structural requirements for
antibacterial activity were determined by Roman, as thiophen-2-yl
derivatives showed the best activity, regardless of the nature of
the amine moiety. The antibacterial properties of other Mannich bases
derived from naphthol have been previously explored.25 Aminoalkylphenols have also been reported to inhibit biofilm
formation26 and classified as anti-infectives
rather than traditional antibiotics as they cure Caenorhabditis
elegans of an Enterococcus faecalis infection at significantly lower concentration than the one required
for in vitro bacteria growth inhibition.27 After observing that the concentration required for an antibacterial
effect of some promising aminoalkylphenols was generally inferior
to the cytotoxic concentrations,19 we then
set to expand our previous library in order to optimize the antibacterial
properties.

Results and Discussion
As multicomponent reactions
are a remarkable tool for the easy
preparation of libraries of compounds,28,29 our previous
library of aminoalkylphenols was expanded using the Petasis borono–Mannich30,31 reaction (Scheme 1). Starting from 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde 1 and indoline 2, the corresponding iminium was formed in situ and trapped
with different aryl boronic acids 3 to provide the desired
tertiary amines 4–17. Ether 18 was
prepared by methylation of the phenol functionality upon treatment
of 4 with dimethyl sulfate. Tertiary amine 21, lacking the oxygen functionality in the nitroaryl substituent,
was prepared by Friedel–Crafts acylation of toluene with meta-nitro benzoyl chloride 19 followed by
reductive amination with indoline.

Scheme 1 Preparation of Aminoalkylphenols 4–17 and Derivatives 18 and 21
The selection of compounds
to be prepared was reasoned based on
two aspects, first, by replacing the 4-methyl substituent in 4 with other isosteres because we have previously identified
position 4 of the phenyl moiety to be important in conferring the
desired antibacterial activity. Therefore, the 4-methyl substituent
in 4 was replaced by other alkyl substituents or heteroatoms
such as thioether, hydroxyl, carbamate, and halogens. Second, in order
to fully disclose the importance of the phenol moiety in the nitroaryl
moiety, the methyl ether derivative 18 and tertiary amine 21 were also prepared and their antibacterial properties were
evaluated.

The synthesized aminoalkylphenols 4–17 and
derivatives 18 and 21 were tested against
a large panel of Gram-positive microorganisms (Table 1), namely, three S. aureus strains (a reference ATCC, a methicillin-resistant and a non-resistant
strain) and two E. faecalis strains
(a reference ATCC and a vancomycin-resistant strain). An E. coli strain, representative of Gram-negative microorganisms,
was also tested, although no antibacterial properties were observed
for any of the compounds assayed (not shown). The modification of
the para-methyl substituent to other alkyl substituents resulted in
derivatives 6–8 of a similar antibacterial profile,
except when a longer C6 alkyl chain was introduced in 9. Replacing the alkyl substituent by a heteroatom functionality
such as thioether, alcohol, or a carbamate also had a detrimental
effect, as observed for 10–12, respectively. Gladly,
the introduction of a halide such as chloride (13) or
bromide (14) resulted in not only augmenting the bacterial
inhibition growth but also in efficacy of killing the bacteria. Notably,
a more effective activity was determined for chloro derivative 13, for which minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and
minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) as low as 1.23 μM
were determined for most of the bacteria tested. On the other hand,
the presence of fluoride (15), change of the position
of the methyl substituent to the 2-position (16), or
replacement of the p-tolyl moiety by a 1-naphthyl
(17) did not confer any improvement to the antibacterial
characteristics of the aminoalkylphenols. Compounds 18 and 21 were poor antibacterials, as the MIC and MBC
values increased by one to two orders of magnitude when compared with
parental 4, hence evidencing the importance of the phenol
functionality in conferring the desired properties.

In order to further elucidate the
antibacterial broadness of the
most promising synthesized aminoalkylphenols, compounds 4, 5, and 13 were tested against a larger
panel of pathogenic Gram-positive bacterial strains with dissimilar
resistance phenotypes. Overall, 32 strains from S.
aureus, E. faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), and Streptococcus
agalactiae—group B (GBS) (eight clinical isolates
from each species) were tested (Figure 1 and Table S1).

Figure 1 MIC values
of compounds 4, 5, and 13 for
diverse clinical isolates of S. aureus, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae. A boxplot chart
was generated using R statistical software v. 3.4.2 and consists of
boxes (median and interquartile range) and whiskers that extend to
the most extreme data points that were no more than 1.5 times the
interquartile range from the box. Boxes represent the variability
of MIC values found among all strains from each species. The horizontal
black line within each box marks the median, while the lowest and
the highest coverage values observed are represented by the extremes
of the whisker below and above each box, respectively. Outliers are
indicated by open circles.

In general, similar MIC values were observed for S. aureus and E. faecalis clinical isolates when compared with those seen for the ATCC adapted
strains. Some exceptions occurred, where, at some instances, a maximum
of fourfold differences were observed, which may be due both to the
dissimilar genetic background of the clinical isolates and to the
extensive in vitro passaging of the ATCC strains. As clearly shown
in Figure 1, all three
selected compounds seem to be much more effective against S. aureus and E. faecalis, displaying a mean of MIC values at least 5.4-fold lower than that
observed for S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae. For the former species, for which
the results were encouraging, compound 13 revealed the
higher antimicrobial efficacy, given by lower and more homogeneous
MIC values.

S. aureus and E.
faecalis are among the most important bacteria causing
infections in the hospital environment.32−34 While S. aureus is the primary cause of lower respiratory
tract infections and surgical site infections and the second leading
cause of nosocomial bacteremia, pneumonia, and cardiovascular infections, E. faecalis is responsible for urinary tract infections
(associated with instrumentation and antimicrobial administration)
followed by intra-abdominal and pelvic infection, surgical wound infection,
bacteremia, endocarditis, neonatal sepsis, and rarely meningitis.11 Furthermore, because of the large usage of broad-spectrum
antibiotics in the hospital environment, both bacteria (mostly S. aureus) are able to emerge and reemerge as multidrug-resistant
clones, which complicates the treatment of the caused nosocomial infections.35,36

A test of lethality to Artemia salina brine shrimp was performed37 in order
to evaluate the toxicity of the different compounds, for which concentrations
of 0.1 mg/mL (217–277 μM) of each compound in dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) were tested (Figure 2). Delightfully, a residual 15% mortality rate was observed
for compound 13, while compounds 11 and 12 were highly toxic with mortality rates of 89 and 98%, respectively.
Fortunately, these compounds were not active against any microorganism
on the antibacterial assay. Of the remaining compounds, none held
a mortality rate higher than 42%, which was observed for the bromide
derivative 14, followed by compound 5 with
a 31% mortality rate. For compounds 4 and 5, mortality rates of 21 and 31% were observed, respectively.

Figure 2 General toxicity
of 4-17 in the mortality rate of A. salina brine shrimp assay was performed. Concentrations
of 10 μg/mL of each compound were tested. The number of dead
larvae was recorded after 24 h and used to calculate the lethal concentration
(%).

To further characterize the toxicity
of the compounds, an in vitro
model representative of noncancer human cells was also used. The cytotoxicity
profile of compound 13 is shown in Figure 3, while other analogues were previously tested19 using the same protocol. No cytotoxic effects
were observed for concentrations of compound 13 up to
26.3 μM. Only the highest concentration tested (65.6 μM)
showed relevant cytotoxicity, decreasing cell viability to 53.4 ±
1.5%. Compared with analogue 4 previously tested, for
which a concentration of 28 μM led to a cell viability of less
than 20%,19 compound 13 shows
a better safety profile.

increasing
concentrations of compound 13 for 24 h. Results are expressed
as average values ± SD from two independent experiments, each
comprising four replicate cultures.

Taking together, the common feature of the presence of the
phenol
moiety and the lack of significant antibacterial activity of 18 and 21, it was hypothesized that the high
activity observed could be related with the antioxidant properties
of phenol compounds.38 Tests of antioxidant
activity of compounds 4–17 using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
(DPPH) method (Figure 4) showed that the bromine and fluorine derivatives 14 and 15 had a scavenging activity of 99 and 94%, respectively.
Compounds 4 and 5 are also highly antioxidant
(85 and 92%, respectively), although not being the case for the chlorine
derivative 13. Furthermore, despite the decent antibacterial
properties found for derivatives 6–8, their antioxidant activity was rather low (35–47%), opposing
the trend observed for compounds 4 and 5. Interestingly, compound 21, lacking the hydroxyl group,
showed antioxidant activity in the same range as the most antioxidant
species tested. Therefore, a different main mode of action other than
an antioxidant mechanism is likely to be the cause of the antibacterial
properties observed.

μM)
by the DPPH method.

As the identified aminoalkylphenols
bear a stereogenic center in
the benzylic position, the separation of both enantiomers of 4 was attempted. Hence, 4 was transformed into
the corresponding Mosher’s ester 22, separated
through preparative thin layer chromatography and further hydrolyzed
(Scheme 2). Chiral
HPLC analysis of the enantiomerically enriched samples of 4 invariably revealed the presence of significant amounts of a minor
enantiomer, which equilibrated to a racemic mixture upon standing
in solution. Ultimately, the enantiomerically enriched samples 4a and 4b obtained (with enantiomeric ratios
of 65:35 and 16:84, respectively) were also tested for their antibacterial
activity (Table 2).
Triggered by the difficulty in obtaining enantiomerically pure samples
of 4, the putative formation of an ortho-quinone methide (QM)39,40 was considered. With this in
mind, the benzyl alcohol 23, was also prepared by arylation
of the 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde (Scheme 2 bottom) and its action for bacteria inhibition growth
also tested (Table 2).

The rather
low antimicrobial activity observed for 23 (Table 2) clearly
indicates that the antibacterial properties of 4 are
not caused by the hydrolyzed QM. On the other hand, both enantiomerically
enriched samples 4a and 4b showed similar
levels of toxicity against bacteria as the previously tested racemate.
Rokita and co-workers have showed that depending on the electronic
feature of the QM, they can be stable toward water nucleophilic attack,
while being trapped by nucleotides or other biomolecules.41,42 Specifically, the introduction of an electron-withdrawing group
in the para-phenol position was shown to decrease
the rate of the QM formation, while also decreasing its lifetime due
to increased reactivity toward hydrolysis.42 When monitoring by 1H NMR a solution of 4 in CDCl3 in the presence of morpholine, we observed the
formation of the morpholine derivative in 79% yield after 96 h which
was attributed to the chloroform slight acidity (Figure S5 in Supporting Information). Contrastingly, a similar
experiment in DMSO-d6 did not show formation
of the corresponding morpholine-substituted aminoalkylphenol after
12 h (Figure S4 in Supporting Information). These observations suggest that even though the nitro substituent
can decrease the ability of aminoalkylphenols to serve as QM precursors,
their formation and fate is highly dependent on the acidity of the
medium. An additional stability test showed that 4 remains
stable in DMSO-d6 at 35 °C for at
least 11 days (Figure S6 in Supporting Information). The ability of water and acids in catalyzing nucleophilic attacks
to QMs has been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally.43−45 Moreover, the presence of an additional aryl substituent should
facilitate the formation of the QM because of additional conjugation.

With the previous observations in mind, the formation of two QMs
from 24 and 25, the latter lacking the additional
phenyl ring and the nitro moiety, was considered by density functional
theory (DFT)46a studies
in the gas phase (Figure 5), by taking into account the previously described role of
bulk water in the alkylation of nitrogen nucleophiles.43,47,48 As expected, the formation of
the QMs is a thermodynamically nonfavored process, as the overall
ΔGform of QM from 24 is +16.4 and ΔGform of QM from 25 is 25.8 kcal/mol (Figures S1 and S2 in Supporting Information). Comparison of energy profiles in Figures S1−S3 reveals the stabilization
effect of the phenyl substituent on the transition states when considering
water as a proton shuttle. Additionally, this substituent and the
nitro moiety induce the stabilization of the QMs, as the 25-derived QM is 10.2 kcal/mol less stable than the one derived from 24. It is worth noting that the presence of the nitro substituent
induces a two-step mechanism, as zwitterion species B is a local minimum of the energy profile (see Figure S3 of Supporting Information for a similar study without
the nitro substituent). On the other hand, the formation of the simplest
QM from 25 seems to occur by a synchronous process where
water acts as a proton shuttle resulting in indoline release. The
interaction of the starting tertiary amines with water results in
an electronic stabilization due to formation of hydrogen bonds, even
though this results in Gibbs energy increase due to the entropy contribution.
The transition state for the proton exchange step in 24, TSAB, is described by a shortening
of the C–O bond of the phenol moiety (1.29 Å in TSAB vs 1.34 Å in A) accompanied by a Wiberg indexb increase (WI
= 1.28 in TSAB vs 1.09 in A). Simultaneously, the O–H bond elongates considerably
(1.31 Å in TSAB vs 1.00
Å in A; WI = 0.27 in TSAB vs 0.59 in A), while a new N–H bond is
established (d = 1.16 Å, WI = 0.43 in TSAB vs d = 1.81
Å, WI = 0.06 in A). The cleavage of the C–N
bond represents the higher energetic barrier, characterized by the TSBC, where the C–O bond becomes
stronger (d = 1.25 Å, WI = 1.48 in TSBC vs d = 1.28 Å, WI
= 1.33 in B), and the C–N bond weakens (d = 2.22 Å, WI = 0.30 in TSBC and d = 1.55 Å, WI = 0.83 in B). When similarly taking into account the water-assisted
decomposition of 25 to the corresponding QM, a single
late transition state TSA′C′ was encountered. The abovementioned events are compacted in
a single transition state, namely, shortening of the C–O bond
(d = 1.24 Å, WI = 1.60 in TSA′C′ vs d = 1.34
Å, WI = 1.07 in A), disruption of the O–H
bond (d = 1.77 Å, WI = 0.07 in TSA′C′ vs d =
0.99 Å, WI = 0.61 in A), formation of the N–H
bond (d = 1.02 Å, WI = 0.71 in TSA′C′ vs d =
1.72 Å, WI = 0.10 in A), and cleavage of the C–N
bond (d = 3.11 Å, WI = 0.04 in TSA′C′ vs d =
1.50 Å, WI = 0.92 in A).

values are presented in kcal/mol, referring to the initial pair of

Considering the low activation energy barrier for formation
of
the 25-derived QM together with their increased stability
as compared to the simplest QM, widely used as a nucleotide alkylating
agent,49,50 is reasonable to suggest this path to be
responsible for the antibacterial properties of the Mannich bases
reported herein. Moreover, several antibiotics, namely, natural products,
are known to have their antibacterial properties ground on their capability
to form quinone methides and subsequently alkylate macromolecules.51,52 Contrarily to the recently reported 1-aminoalkyl 2-naphthols by
Roman,24 the antibacterial properties of
the compounds described herein are highly dependent on the amine moiety.19 As indoline is released upon QM formation, other
unforeseen modes of action might be the cause of the antibacterial
properties. The rather lower cytotoxic levels of the studied compounds
are surely dependent on the different metabolisms of the organisms
tested and could be explained by a faster kinetic profile toward QM
formation in the bacterial media.53,54

Conclusions
In summary, through use of Petasis borono–Mannich multicomponent
reaction, starting from 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde, we were able to expand
our library of aminoalkylphenols and find more potent antibacterials
than the previously reported. The most active compound synthesized 13 was demonstrated to be selectively active against important
bacteria responsible for nosocomial infections (S.
aureus and E. faecalis), while only moderately active against S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae. Gladly, the most
active compounds against bacteria showed cytotoxicity against mammalian
cells only at concentrations considerably higher than the determined
MICs, as verified through an in vitro model. The phenol moiety was
verified to be essential to achieve the desired antibacterial properties;
however, such properties do not relate with the antioxidant properties
of the compounds tested. As Mannich bases have been demonstrated to
be precursors of quinone methides, a computational study was performed,
and the results found are in line with such a hypothesis. As quinone
methides are highly reactive, they can play a role as antibacterial
agents, although not encompassing the hydrolyzed adduct. This aspect
is also in agreement with the determined MICs of mixtures of different
enantiomeric ratios, as both enantiomers can form a similar reactive
intermediate. Nevertheless, the antibacterial mode of action of these
compounds remains obscure, and further studies will be reported in
due course.

Experimental Section
General Remarks
All reagents were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
or TCI and were used without further purification. The reactions were
performed under argon atmosphere and monitored by thin-layer chromatography
carried out on precoated (Merck TLC silica gel 60 F254) aluminium
plates by using UV light as a visualizing agent and cerium molybdate
solution or ninhydrin as developing agents. Flash column chromatography
was performed on silica gel 60 (Merck, 0.040–0.063 mm). NMR
spectra were recorded with Varian Mercury 300 MHz or JEOL ECZR 500
instruments using CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 as solvents and calibrated using tetramethylsilane as internal
standard. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm referenced
to the CDCl3 residual peak (δ 7.26) or TMS peak (δ
0.00) for 1H NMR, to CDCl3 (δ 77.16) for 13C NMR. The following abbreviations were used to describe
peak splitting patterns: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m
= multiplet. Coupling constants, J, were reported

General Method for the Synthesis of Aminoalkylphenols 4–17
Indoline (56 μL, 0.50 mmol) was
added to a solution of 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzaldehyde (83.6 mg, 0.50
mmol) and arylboronic acid (0.50 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE)
or ethanol (EtOH; 5.0 mL) at 50 °C. The reaction was stirred
at the same temperature until it was complete as judged by TLC. The
solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue was
purified by column chromatography to give the pure aminoalkylphenol.

22minor (11.6 mg, 20 μmol, 1 equiv) was hydrolyzed
by adding 0.01 M NaOH in methanol (2.2 mL, 1.1 equiv). The reaction
mixture was stirred for 15 min and then neutralized by adding 0.1
M aq HCl (0.22 mL, 1.1 equiv). The resulting mixture was diluted with
brine (3 mL) and extracted with Et2O (3 × 3 mL). Organic
extracts were combined, dried over Na2SO4, filtered,
and evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by
column chromatography (hexane/EtOAc, gradient from 85:15 to 80:20)
to yield 4b (7.3 mg, 20 μmol). A 16:84 enantiomeric
ratio was determined by HPLC analysis of the acetate derivative of 4, using a Chiralpak IA column (hexane/iProH 99:1, 1.0 mL/min,
λ = 254 nm, trminor = 12.54 min, trmajor = 14.16 min). A similar procedure was applied to 22Major (8.8 mg, 15 μmol), affording 4a (4.9 mg, 13.5 μmol) in a 65:35 enantiomeric ratio
determined upon subsequent derivatization to the acetate derivative
and chiral HPLC analysis. The procedure for derivatization is as follows:
enantiomerically enriched samples of 4 (1 mg, 2.8 μmol,
1 equiv) in 0.25 mL of dry DCM were treated with acetyl chloride (1.8
μL, 16.6 μmol, 6 equiv) and Et3N (0.25 μL,
2.8 μmol, 1.1 equiv) in dry DCM (50 μL) at room temperature
under argon. The reaction was stirred for 25 min and quenched by adding
saturated aq NaHCO3 (0.25 mL). To the resulting solution
was added DCM and H2O (0.75 mL each). The layers were separated
and the aqueous layer further extracted with DCM (2 × 1 mL).
Organic extracts were combined and filtered through silica, and the
solvent was removed under reduced pressure.

Antibacterial
Assays
For selective purposes, the antimicrobial
activity of the diverse compounds was first tested against five bacterial
Gram-positive strains obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC): S. aureus ATCC25923 (MSSA), S. aureus CIP6538, S. aureus CIP106760 (MRSA), E. faecalis 29212,
and E. faecalis ATCC51299 (VRE). For
the most promising compounds (i.e., compounds 4, 5, and 13), the antimicrobial activity was further
evaluated against eight distinct clinical isolates of S. aureus, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae (group B) that belong to the wide collection
of pathogenic Gram-positive strains of the Portuguese National Institute
of Health (NIH).

For each compound, the minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) was determined by the broth microdilution method,56 according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) guidelines.57 Before each
experiment, frozen stocks of all strains were subcultured three times
in appropriate culture medium (CAMHB for S. aureus and E. faecalis and CAMHB-LHB 3.5%
for streptococci) to check strain viability and to avoid any negative
growth effect from congelation, and inocula of 1.5 × 108 cfu/mL (the equivalent to 0.5 McFarland) were prepared accordingly.
For each microorganism, a 1:20 dilution of the prepared inoculum was
used. Twofold serial dilutions of concentrated stock compound solutions
(1 mM) were prepared in the required medium into 96-well plates. A
control without compounds was also prepared. All cultures were incubated
for 16–24 h at 35–37 °C with 5% CO2.
Purity check and colony or viable cell counts of the inoculum suspensions
were also evaluated in order to ensure that the final inoculum density
closely approximates the intended number. This was obtained by subculturing
a diluted aliquot from the growth control well (without compound)
immediately after inoculation onto a suitable nonselective agar plate
for simultaneous incubation. The MIC was determined as the lowest
compound concentration at which no visible growth was observed. The
bacterial growth was measured with an absorbance microplate reader
(Thermo Scientific Multiskan FC, Loughborough, UK) set to 620 nm.

The MBC was also evaluated. Briefly, after MIC assessment, the
bacterial suspension on the wells was homogenized, serial-diluted,
triplicate spread on appropriate medium and incubated. The MBC attributed
to the compound concentration resulting in a 99.9% reduction in bacterial
numbers. All assays were carried out in triplicate for each tested
microorganism.

DPPH Method for Antioxidant Activity
The antioxidant
activity of the compounds was tested as previously described.58 To evaluate the compounds’ antioxidant
potential through the free radical scavenging test, the change in
optical density of DPPH radicals was monitored. The absorbance was
measured at 517 nm against a corresponding blank and the antioxidant
activity was calculated using the following equation  

The reference
standard used for this
procedure was butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT).

A. salina Mortality Bioassay
A test of mortality was performed on A. salina brine shrimp, of the compounds 4–17, as previously
described.59 For this assay, an aquarium
air pump (HI-FLOTM Single Type 4000), a thermostat Cabinet Aqua Lytic,
and a stereomicroscope (CETI Belgium) were used. The number of dead nauplii was recorded after 24 h and used to calculate the
percentage (%) of mortality rate, according to the equation  

Cell Culture and Cytotoxicity Assessment
The cytotoxicity
profile of the compound 13 was characterized in the normal-like
human keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line). HaCat cells were routinely
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin.
Cells were kept at 37 °C, under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air. Cell viability was evaluated by the MTT assay, using
a 24 h incubation protocol, according to a previously published procedure.60 Two independent experiments were carried out,
each comprising four replicate cultures.
