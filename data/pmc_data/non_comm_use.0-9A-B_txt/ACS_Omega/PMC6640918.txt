Composite
systems where quantum dots (QDs) are combined with other
nanomaterials (e.g., gold nanorods) in aqueous solutions have attracted
broad attention—both for their potential in applications and
for studies of fundamental processes. However, high-quality QDs are
typically prepared in organic solvents, and the transfer of QDs to
an aqueous phase is needed to create the desired QD composites. Photostability
of the transferred QDs—both the steady-state and photo-induced
dynamic properties—is essential for studying the processes
in the composites and for their applications. We present a detailed
study of the photostability of aqueous CdxSeyZn1–xS1–y gradient core–shell
QDs obtained by various approaches using linker exchange and surfactant
encapsulation. Beside the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) emission
stability, we also study changes in the PL decay. From the variety
of the studied samples, the water-soluble QDs encapsulated by a double
layer of oleic acid show superior properties, that is, stable PL emission
and PL decay under continuous light or pulsed-laser light irradiation.
We demonstrate that the double-layer encapsulation of QDs can be used
to create QDs–metal nanoparticle composites.

Introduction
Semiconductor nanocrystals
(quantum dots, QDs) have received broad
attention because of their optical properties, such as high photoluminescence
(PL) quantum yield (QY), photostability, size tunability, continuous
absorption band, and long luminescence lifetime.1−4 QDs have been widely used in light-emitting
diodes,5−7 lasers,8 photovoltaics,9 and biomarkers.10 Among
other environments, aqueous solutions of QDs (or polar solvents in
general) have been extensively studied for two main reasons: (i) combining
QDs with materials natively prepared in a polar solvent (gold nanoparticles,
metal-oxide nanostructures, and proteins) and (ii) use in bioapplications.
Although QDs can be synthesized directly in an aqueous solution, water-based
fabrication methods suffer from a wide distribution of QD sizes and
a low PL QY.11−13 On the other hand, high-quality QDs (in the sense
of uniformity, size control, and crystallinity) can be readily synthesized
in noncoordinating organic solvents.11,14−16 In this case, QDs are inevitably coated with hydrophobic molecules
and can be dissolved only in nonpolar media. Hence, surface modification
is needed to render QDs to be water soluble.

Two strategies
can be used to transfer the QDs from an organic
phase to the water phase. The first strategy is the direct ligand
exchange after the QDs are synthesized in an organic solvent. This
is the most widely used method for phase transfer of QDs.16−20 This process can change the chemical and physical properties of
the QDs, thereby negatively influencing PL QY and dramatically decreasing
the pH-sensitive stability of the QDs.21−23 Furthermore, the exchanged
ligand can be cleaved from the surface of the QDs by oxidation, and
such QDs, therefore, tend to aggregate.24 The second strategy is the surface encapsulation: QDs can be encapsulated
by a silica shell layer through a surface silanization process,25−28 coated by amphiphilic polymers11,29−31 or a surfactant molecule layer.11,15,17,32−34 These encapsulation methods modify the surface of QDs by adding
an extra hydrophilic layer around the hydrophobic capping agent surface.
Such an extra hydrophilic layer does not directly interact with QDs
and therefore would not deteriorate the high stability and PL QY of
QDs. This process provides significantly higher quality QDs compared
with those prepared using the ligand exchange.

Most of the published
studies focused on increasing the PL QY of
the water-soluble QDs by the phase transfer process.17,20,22,27,35 Nevertheless, the photostability and especially
the stable photoinduced dynamic properties are important factors for
aqueous QDs and their applications. The photostability of water-soluble
QDs can be affected by surface defects that are introduced during
the phase transfer procedure.24,36−38 In this article, we study water-soluble CdxSeyZn1–xS1–y gradient core–shell
QDs prepared using ligand exchange and two different surfactant encapsulation
methods (see Scheme 1 and Figure S1). We compare the stability
of the photoinduced dynamic process of the water-soluble CdxSeyZn1–xS1–y gradient
core–shell QDs by steady-state and time-resolved PL spectroscopies.
We demonstrate that photostability can be used in studying the interaction
between water-soluble QDs and surface plasmon (SP) objects (gold or
silver nanoparticles), where the research is conditioned by PL intensity
and decay stability.39 Moreover, the results
are applicable in a broad range of QD photophysics.

Scheme 1 Schematic Diagram
of the Phase Transfer QDs from Toluene to Ethanol
or Water by Using Linker Exchange or Surfactant Encapsulation Strategies
Our results reveal that water-soluble
QDs prepared with double-layer
oleic acid (OA) as a surfactant feature photostability with stable
photoinduced dynamic properties. Besides this, we also demonstrate
the fabrication of QDs–AuNR composite based on water-soluble
QDs.

Results and Discussion
We first measured the absorption
and PL spectra of samples T, E,
W1, W2, and W3 (see Figure 1) to verify the QD transfer to ethanol or water via linker
exchanging or surfactant encapsulation. The absorption spectra of
these samples overlap with each other. The PL spectra for the QDs
in toluene, ethanol, and water share the same shape. We did not observe
any defect emission at the red side of the band edge emission peak.40

spectra.
Black solid line: absorption of QDs in toluene (T); red solid line:
absorption of QDs (linker exchanged to 3-MPA) in ethanol (E); green
solid line: absorption of QDs (linker exchanged to 3-MPA) in water
(W1); blue solid line: absorption of QDs (AOT encapsulated) in water
(W2); and pink solid line: absorption of QDs (OA encapsulated) in
water (W3). Black dashed line, red dashed line, green dashed line,
blue dashed line, and pink dashed line represent the PL emission spectra
of T, E, W1, W2, and W3, respectively. T, E, and W1 absorption spectra
cannot be distinguished.

In general, the PL intensity is significantly decreased after
phase
transfer (linker exchange and surfactant encapsulation) compared with
that of the QDs before phase transfer (see Figure 2a), indicating the existence of PL quenching.
Such a quenching can be ascribed to surface defects introduced by
the phase transfer process.36−38 However, as the surfactant encapsulation
is expected to introduce less surface defects compared with the linker
exchange process, the PL intensities of samples W2 and W3 are higher
than those QDs obtained using the linker exchange process (samples
E and W1).

Figure 2 (a) PL spectra of T, E, W1, W2, and W3 (normalized to absorbance
at excitation wavelength 450 nm, see Figure S3); (b) time-dependent PL intensity at 585 nm with a continuous light
irradiation at 450 nm: black dots, red dots, green dots, blue dots,
and pink dots represent the time-dependent PL intensities of T, E,
W1, W2, and W3, respectively. All curves are normalized to sample
T at time zero for visual convenience. The PL intensities of E, W1,
W2, and W3 were multiplied by factors of 12, 43, 6, and 6, respectively.

To evaluate the photostability
of the prepared samples, the steady-state
PL intensity under continuous-wave (CW) light irradiation was measured,
as shown in Figure 2b. The same excitation power (1.3 mW/cm2) was used here
for all samples, and thus, enabling the comparison of the photostability
among different samples is valid. Under 450 nm CW light irradiation,
the PL intensity of all samples exhibits a general increase in the
long timescale. This can be ascribed to the photoinduced surface passivation,
which enhances PL emission.24 Compared
with those of samples E and W1, the PL intensity changes for samples
W2 and W3 are much smaller, demonstrating a lower surface activity
in the surfactant encapsulation prepared QDs. Moreover, the OA-encapsulated
QDs (W3) are the most stable among all aqueous phase QDs owing to
the OA double layer protecting the QD surface. After a 3 h CW light
irradiation, the full width at half-maxima (FWHM) of PL emission spectra
was unchanged compared with QDs before CW light irradiation (Table S1).

It should also be noted that
the minor fluctuations in the PL intensity
evolution in Figure 2 can be assigned to the fluctuations in the QD concentration within
the irradiated spot or competition among processes such as H2O adsorption, photo-oxidation, and photocorrosion on the surface
of the QDs.24

Besides steady-state
emission, the stable photoinduced dynamic
properties would be another important factor to investigate the interaction
between QDs and other objects (molecules, SP structures, metal-oxides,
and so on). We, therefore, investigated the time evolution of PL decays
of water-soluble QDs during the time-correlated single-photon-counting
(TCSPC) measurement—see Figure 3. To achieve that, we measured several sequential PL
decay curves for each sample. Changes in the decay curves are a sensitive
probe for photodamage.

Figure 3 Stability of the photodynamic process with 438 nm picosecond-pulsed
laser continuous irradiation, the PL decay was recorded at an interval
of 5 min. Each decay curve took 2 min to record. (a) Normalized PL
decay curve of T (black line), E (red line), W1 (green line), W2 (blue
line), and W3 (orange line) at the first measurement. (b–f)
illustrate the (in)stability of the PL kinetics of T, E, W1, W2, and
W3, respectively. The samples were measured immediately after the
preparation.

Figure 3a summarizes
the normalized very first PL decay curves for all fresh samples. W1
exhibits the fastest PL decay among these samples, which is in agreement
with the lowest PL emission intensity (Figure 2a). In addition, the PL decay rate for other
samples decreases progressively (T, W2, W3, E, and W1) in accordance
with the trend of PL intensities in steady-state emission measurement.

Under 438 nm picosecond-pulsed laser irradiation, the consequently
measured PL decays are changing over time for E and W2. The PL decay
becomes faster under 438 nm laser continuous irradiation in E. For
W2, the PL decay slows down for the three initial measurements, and
then, it speeds up for the last two measurements. For W1, W3, and
T, the TCSPC-measured decays remain stable within the six measured
scans. As one can notice, sample T is the most stable one because
of the as-prepared QDs with less surface defects. This indicates that
surface defects can affect the photoinduced dynamic properties of
QDs.

Considering the photostability results taken from both
steady-state
and time-resolved PL measurements, the photostability of W3 is comparable
with that of the as-prepared sample in an organic solvent (T), and
sample W3 is the most suitable one for studying the QDs and their
composites in aqueous solution. Nevertheless, to fabricate such composites,
the aqueous QDs have to remain stable with the addition of other objects
or solvent; especially, the QDs have to show resistance against pH
fluctuations, which can be introduced by adding a small amount of
water. In our case, we verify the pH resistance by adding 40 μL
of Milli-Q (MQ) water into two water-soluble QDs W3 and W1 and comparing
the absorption, PL emission, and PL decay spectra (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 Absorption, PL emission,
and PL decay spectra of W1, W1 with 40
μL of MQ water added, W3, and W3 with 40 μL of MQ water
added. (a) Steady-state absorption and PL spectra of W1 and W1 with
40 μL of MQ water added; (b) PL decay of W1 and W1 with 40 μL
of MQ water added; (c) steady-state absorption and PL spectra of W3
and W3 with 40 μL of MQ water added; and (d) PL decay of W3
and W3 with 40 μL of MQ water added.

After adding 40 μL of MQ water into 3 mL of W1 solution,
the absorption and PL emission intensity are decreased (see Figure 4a), whereas the PL
decay becomes faster (see Figure 4b). These changes are due to the aggregation of QDs
in W1, which is induced by the pH change in the solution. During the
linker exchanging process, TMAH solution needs to be added to modify
the surface of the negatively charged QDs. The negatively charged
QDs show repulsive force against each other, thus preventing the aggregation
of the QDs.41 The electrostatic repulsion
among QDs was diminished after a small amount (VMQ water/VW1 = 1.3%) of MQ
water was added to W1, leading to the aggregation of QDs.

At
the same time, there is no difference between W3 and W3 with
40 μL of MQ water added. We obtained identical absorption, PL
emission, and PL decay spectra (see Figure 4c,d). In W3, the QDs are encapsulated in
two layers of OA molecules, and a small amount (VMQ water/VW1 = 1.3%)
of MQ water is not able to change the encapsulation structure. We
repeated the experiments three times without observing any difference
(see Figures S4 and S5).

To obtain
further insight into the structure of OA-encapsulated
QDs (W3), the TEM images were recorded (Figure 5). After the phase transfer, the QDs in W3
remain separated from each other without aggregation. The interparticle
distance is influenced by the capping agent, and it is possible to
confirm the formation of OA double layer by measuring the interparticle
distance. However, one can notice that in the high-resolution TEM
image not only does the crystalline structure (QDs) give the contrast
(the orange circle in Figure 5 inset) but an additional thin noncrystalline layer is also
clearly visible in W3 (see the blue circle in Figure 5a inset). This layer may be an amorphous
capping agent or other supernatants. For the sample T, no such thin
layer could be identified outside of the QDs. The extra layer in W3
cannot be ascribed to the different size of QDs because W3 and T QDs
had the same size—see the nearly identical absorption spectra
in Figure 1. The extra
layer makes it difficult to judge the interparticle distance. Hence,
we measured the center-to-center distance to confirm the formation
of OA encapsulation in W3. Between two individual QDs, the center-to-center
distance in W3 (11.0 ± 2.7 nm) is larger than that in T (9.6
± 1.8 nm). The larger distance in W3 is in good agreement with
the presence of double layers of OA encapsulating the QDs. The length
of the OA molecule is 2 nm.42

and QDs in toluene (b); inset: high-resolution TEM image of QDs in
W3 and T, the center-to-center distance distribution histograms of
two adjacent QDs in W3 (c) and in T (d).

The OA-encapsulated QDs show a stable photoinduced dynamic
process
and the encapsulation structure shows resistance for small amounts
of water. Therefore, it is possible to study the interaction between
W3 and other objects in the nanocomposite structures, especially the
excited-state dynamic processes. A good example is the QDs–AuNR
composites, which have been widely studied for plasmon interactions.
Here, we combine our QDs (W3) with AuNRs in water and monitor the
excited-state dynamics of such a system to obtain insights into the
interaction between two parts. Figure 6 shows the absorption, PL emission, and PL decay spectra
of W3 with the addition of 40 μL of AuNRs (5.1 μmol/L).
The absorption spectrum of AuNRs is dominated by plasmon modes with
a high extinction coefficient compared with QDs. The steady-state
PL intensity of QDs is quenched, and the PL decays faster with the
addition of AuNRs (Figure 6b). The observed PL quenching can be attributed to a combination
of different factors such as the large extinction coefficient of AuNRs,
defects introduced by AuNRs, charge transfer,43 and energy transfer. We can neglect the effect of AuNR reabsorption
because of a moderate absorbance (OD ≈ 0.1, Figure 6a) at the PL emission peak.
The defect formation is unlikely due to the passivation of the QDs
via an OA double layer. At the same time, the energy transfer was
reported to dominate the PL quenching for QD–metal nanoparticle
donor–acceptor distance in the range of 2–6 nm.44−46 Our QDs−AuNR nanocomposites fulfill such a condition with
an OA double layer spacer. We conclude that the energy transfer is
the most plausible explanation for the observed changes.

Conclusions
The photostability of water-soluble CdxSeyZn1–xS1–y gradient
core–shell
QDs encapsulated via three different strategies was evaluated and
compared with the properties of the original QDs in toluene and QDs
transferred to ethanol. The shapes of the steady-state absorption
and PL emission spectra remain the same for all samples, proving that
OA-capped QDs can be successfully transferred from a nonpolar solvent
(toluene) to a polar solvent (ethanol or water) via both linker exchange
and surfactant encapsulation methods. Nevertheless, within the studied
samples, the QDs encapsulated by a double layer of OA (sample W3)
feature superior stability both of the steady-state PL intensity and
of nanosecond PL decay. We demonstrate that such QDs can be combined
with AuNRs and form composites where energy transfer between QDs and
AuNRs can be observed and studied. QDs encapsulated by a double layer
of OA can be useful for developing QDs–AuNR nanocomposites
and study interaction between QDs and other objects in an aqueous
environment.

Experimental Section
OA (Sigma-Aldrich,
90%)-capped CdxSeyZn1–xS1–y gradient core–shell QDs
were prepared by a previously reported single-step hot injection method.16,47 A mixture of 0.4 mmol cadmium oxide (CdO, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%),
4 mmol zinc acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%), and 17.6 mmol OA in 20
mL of 1-octadecene (ODE, Sigma-Aldrich, 90%) was heated to 150 °C
and degassed under vacuum for 30 min. Then, the mixture was further
heated up to 310 °C under a N2 atmosphere to form
a clear solution of Cd(OA)2 (Cd-oleate) and Zn(OA)2 (Zn-oleate), as precursors for cations. Then, a mixture of
0.4 mmol selenium powder (Se, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%), 4 mmol sulfur
(S, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%), and trioctylphosphine (TOP, Sigma-Aldrich,
90%) was injected swiftly into the precursor solution. To control
the shell thickness of the gradient core–shell QDs, the reaction
was stopped by cooling the solution in an ice bath 3 min after the
injection. To purify the as-prepared core–shell QDs, a mixture
of chloroform and acetone (Vchloroform/Vacetone = 1:5) was added dropwise and
the QDs were centrifuged at 6500 rpm for 10 min. The purification
procedure was repeated twice, and the purified OA-capped gradient
core–shell QDs with an approximately 3 nm core and 1.3 nm shell48 were then dissolved in the nonpolar organic
solvent toluene (T, see Scheme 1) with a concentration of approximately 1.7 mM. The concentration
was estimated based on the absorption spectrum and the extinction
coefficient of the QDs, which follows a size-dependent empirical function.49

Ligand exchange and surfactant encapsulation
methods (see Scheme 1) were used in phase
transfer experiments. The ligand exchange was conducted by using the
strong affiliation ability between 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA)
and QDs. Four hundred microliters of stock QDs in toluene solution
was mixed with 80 μL of 3-MPA and 200 μL of ethanol. The
mixture was stirred for 30 min, and QDs were capped with 3-MPA and
aggregated in the mixture. The aggregated QDs were collected by centrifuging
the mixture for 5 min at 3500 rpm speed. The solvent was discarded,
and the residual was dissolved in 40 mL of water or ethanol. Then,
75 μL of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH, Sigma-Aldrich,
25 wt %) in methanol was dropwise added to the water or ethanol QD
solution, causing a clear solution with a pH value of approximately
10.50 Finally, 3-MPA-capped QDs can be
dissolved in water (W1, see Scheme 1) or ethanol (E, see Scheme 1). For the surfactant encapsulation strategy,
two different surfactants were used. One was AOT (sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)-sulfosuccinate,
from Sigma-Aldrich, ≥97%), and the other one was OA.

QDs encapsulated by the AOT surfactant (W2, see Scheme 1) were prepared by a previously
reported method.34 In brief, a toluene
solvent of 400 μL of QD stock solution was evaporated under
vacuum at room temperature and dark condition. The remaining QD solids
were then dispersed in 4 mL of hexane with the addition of 120 mg
of AOT. Subsequently, the mixture was added to 40 mL of 3 g/L NaCl
water solution under vigorous stirring, in which an oil-in-water (O/W)
emulsion was formed. This hexane in mixture was then removed by bathing
in 80 °C water with stirring for 30 min. The residual was cooled
down to room temperature followed by centrifuging at 6500 rpm for
15 min. The final QD aqueous solution was collected by filtration
through a syringe filter (pore size of 200 nm, VWR International),
which can filter out QDs aggregates. During the experiment, no retention
was observed on the filter.

OA can also be used as a surfactant
for the water-soluble QD preparation.15 Here, 80 μL of OA was added to 4 mL of
the same QD suspension in hexane mentioned above. The solvent was
then sonicated for 1 min. Afterward, 40 mL of MQ water (Millipore,
18.2 MΩ cm) was added to this hexane solution under vigorous
stirring. Another 1 h sonication was then performed until a cloudy
and colorless solution was formed. Phase separation took place after
keeping this mixture undisturbed in dark for 24 h. QDs appeared at
the bottom of the water phase were collected and purified by centrifuging
at 6500 rpm for 15 min. Consequently,
the upper clear solution would contain only QDs encapsulated by an
OA double layer (W3, see Scheme 1), which can be well-dispersed in water. Such a solution
would undergo final filtration through a syringe filter (pore size
of 200 nm, VWR International) before usage. During the experiment,
no retention was observed on the filter. The ligand exchange and the
surfactant encapsulation mechanisms are shown in Scheme 1. The mechanisms are supported
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) data (see Figure S1).

Water-dispersed gold nanorods
(41 × 10 nm in dimension, with
6-amino-1-hexanethiol hydrochloride as conjugation) were purchased
from Nanopartz.

UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded
using a PerkinElmer
Lambda 1050 spectrophotometer. FTIR spectra were recorded using a
Nicolet iS5 FT-IR instrument. The steady-state fluorescence spectra
were recorded using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer.
This spectrofluorometer has been used to determine the photostability
of QDs. QD samples were irradiated at 450 nm by CW light with an excitation
intensity of 1.3 mW/cm2. The spot size was approximately
1 cm × 0.8 cm. The PL intensity at 585 nm was measured up to
3 h. Time-resolved PL measurements were taken using a TCSPC device
(PicoQuant). A pulsed diode laser, triggered externally at 2.5 MHz,
was used to excite the sample at 438 nm, with an excitation fluence
of 3.3 × 1011 photons/cm2/pulse. The pulse
duration of the laser was approximately 200 ps. The emitted photons
were focused onto a fast avalanche photodiode (SPAD, Micro Photon
Device). The response time of the photodiode was <50 ps. TEM images
were recorded using a JEOL JEM-2100F instrument.
