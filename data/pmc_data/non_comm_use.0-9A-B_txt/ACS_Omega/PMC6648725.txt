We
report a simple and “green” method for the fabrication
of polymer-modified straw-supported oil degradation bacteria (PMS-ODB)
for biological degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs)
in water. The modification of straw was achieved by in situ copolymerization
of styrene and butyl methacrylate using methylene-bis-acrylamide as
a cross-linker in an aqueous solution containing straw powders. Compared
with the control group (ODB loaded on untreated straw), the results
obtained from the experimental group show that the polymer-modified
straw is beneficial to the growth of microorganisms. As a result,
the degradation rate of TPHs reaches 90.12%, which is 50.54 and 7.08%
higher than that of the blank group (ODB only) and the control group,
respectively. A study on the transformation characteristics of PMS-ODB
shows that the degradation rate of alkanes with low, medium, and high
carbon number is higher than 90%. w(∑C21–)/w(∑C22+) (the
mass ratio of normal alkanes of high carbon/low carbon), w(pr)/w(ph) (the ratio of pristane/phytane), and
OEP (the mass ratio of normal alkanes of odd carbon/even carbon) for
TPHs in the experimental group were measured to be 0.6186, 0.7248,
and 1.4356, respectively, all of which are the largest value among
the blank group, control group, and experimental group. These findings
indicate that compared with the control group, the modification of
straw could enhance the comprehensive biological degradation performance
for TPHs, even those highly stable organics, such as carbon n-alkanes and isoprenoid hydrocarbon, which may open a new
possibility for degradation of oils or toxic organics in an enhanced
biological manner.

==== Body
Introduction
The rapid development of modern industry
has led to severe environmental
pollution, in particular, organic pollution in water such as oil spills
and nitrogen-containing aromatic waste (e.g., nitrobenzene) has aroused
serious concerns and worldwide attention owing to its high environmental
toxicity and biological accumulation, which has caused numerous ecological
problems.1,2 Thus, there is an urgent need to develop
new technologies or functional materials for efficient removal or
elimination of oils or organic contaminants from water.

So far,
a number of approaches such as adsorption, flotation, flocculation,
electrochemistry, membrane separation, and biological methods have
been used for organic wastewater treatment.3−6 These methods, in most cases,
have their respective limitations such as the need of complicated
techniques or poor reusability with high operation costs.7−9 For instance, the absorption technology has been adapted as one
of the promising remedies to this point. However, the inherent drawbacks
for most of the conventional absorbents such as clay, activated carbon,
and so on, for example, poor selectivity and limited absorption performance,
still remain as a big issue. The recently developed superwetting absorbents
with superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic wettability have excellent
absorption selectivity for removal of oils or lipophilic organics;
however, the need of a multistep process or complicated techniques
still remains a big obstacle for their scalable fabrication and in
turn hindering their practical applications.10 On the other hand, the environmental and ecological risk of using
these absorbents in application remains unclear and the disposal of
them after use may also cause new environmental pollution.11 Therefore, the exploitation of functional materials
that fulfill such multivariable performance requirements for efficient
removal of oils and organics from water should be of special interest.

Comparatively, biological methods for degradation of oils or organic
contaminants have great technological advantages over those mentioned
methods, including environmental friendliness, simple operation, low-energy
consumption, and, importantly, capability of direct and complete degradation
of contaminants into harmless emissions. In general, the microorganisms, in this case, oil degradation bacteria
(ODB), are immobilized on supporting materials to confine to a certain
region of space keeping fixed microorganism growth and biological
activity to highly efficient degradation of oil pollutants.12,13 Therefore, the number of microorganisms on a given supporting material,
the biological degradation activity for oils or organics, and the
accessible contact area of microorganisms to organics are essential
for their biological degradation performance. To date, cellulose has
been employed as a supporting material for immobilization of microorganisms
in this field.14,15 Though great progress has been
made accordingly, the poor stability of immobilization of microorganisms
as well as the weak affinity of hydrophilic biomass supporting materials
to lipophilic oils or hydrocarbon organics which hinders the effective
contact of immobilized microorganisms to oils still remains a big
challenge for their large-scale applications.16 In this regard, here we demonstrate an approach for modification
of hydrophilic biomass straw with relative hydrophobic copolymers
to enhance both the stability of immobilization of microorganisms
and the affinity of microorganism-immobilized straw to oils. As a
proof-of-concept study, the number of microorganisms, the activity
of dehydrogenase, and the degradation rate for oils are enhanced compared
with control, which shows great potential for practical wastewater
treatment. Furthermore, the transformation characteristics of total
petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) were also investigated to provide an
insight into fundamental understanding of evolution path for future
study. This may open a new possibility for degradation of oils or
toxic organics in an enhanced biological manner.

Results and Discussion
Material
Characterization Analysis
Figure 1a shows the Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra of corn straw (CS) and polymer-modified
straw (PMS). It is clear that there are new absorption peaks in PMS
compared with CS; the characteristic absorption peaks at 2376 and
2334 cm–1 are assigned to the vibration of benzene
ring, and the absorption peak at 1733 and 1066 cm–1 belongs to the telescopic vibration of the C=O bond and C–O–C
bond in butyl methacrylate. The characteristic absorption peak at
1546 cm–1 is assigned to the telescopic vibration
of C=C skeleton in the benzene ring. The peak at 617.79 cm–1 is attributed to the vibration of the C–H
bond outside the benzene ring. The absorption peak at 766 cm–1 belongs to the bending vibration of C–H bond benzene ring.
The vibration absorption peak of the hydroxyl group associated with
PMS at 3401 cm–1 weakens, indicating that the hydroxyl
position is not completely a graft reaction and the material still
maintains the properties of cellulose after the reaction.

Figure 1 Material characterization
[(a) FT-IR, (b) XRD, (c) SEM, and (d)
contact angle].

The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of CS and PMS are shown in Figure 1b. It can be seen
that the XRD diffraction patterns of CS has changed before and after
modification. According to the intensity of the peaks corresponding
to I22.5° and I16.8°, the formula of crystallization index is expressed
as follows 1  

The crystallinity of CS and
PMS was calculated to be 0.403 and
0.273, respectively. It can be seen that the crystallinity of PMS
is 0.130 lower than that of CS. Such a decrease in the crystallinity
of CS may be due to the formation of amorphous copolymers, which in
turn indicates the occurrence of successful graft copolymerization.17 As shown by the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of PMS in Figure 1c, the surface of CS consists of a compact fibrous structure,
showing that the modification of straw by the polymer is obvious,
which makes the straw a more rough surface with larger specific surface
and more adsorption sites. Such an increase in surface roughness is
beneficial to the adsorption and immobilization of mixed bacteria
on the surface. The hollow cellulose tube in the straw not only facilitates
the diffusion of the substrate and metabolites but also provides enough
space and oxygen for maintaining the normal physiological metabolism
of microorganisms.

To investigate the effect of polymer modification
of CS on its
surface wettability, the water contact angle (WCA) for CS and PMS
was determined. As shown in Figure 1d, when a water droplet was placed on the surface of
CS, it can be absorbed quickly. However, it can maintain a spherical
shape when it was placed on the surface of PMS, indicating a strong
water repulsion. The WCA was measured to be 0° for CS and 128.5°
for PMS, respectively. Such an obvious change of wettability of CS
before and after polymeric modification, that is, the hydrophilic
CS turns to be hydrophobic, is attributed to both the enhanced surface
roughness and the lipophilic chemistry nature of copolymer of styrene
and butyl methacrylate, which are two key factors for construction
of a strong hydrophobic surface.18 As expected,
the strong hydrophobicity of PMS would be beneficial to enhance the
affinity of PMS to oils or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which
might increase its biodegradation performance.

Analysis of Changes in
Microbial Quantity and Degradation Gradient
The effect of
duration time on the microbial quantity and the degradation
gradient of three groups are shown in Figure 2. It is well-known that microbes secrete
specific extracellular enzymes, use some organic matter as nutrients
to be absorbed by microbes, and the rest of the nutrients are oxidized
by microbes into simple organics or inorganic substances, purifying
oily wastewater in the early stages.19 As
an indicator of microbial adaptability to the substrate, microbial
quantity has a good correlation with the degradation effect of petroleum
hydrocarbons.20 It is clear that the microbial
quantity of the experimental group reaches the maximum value of 1.69
× 109 g–1 after a duration of 3
d and then gradually decreases with the increase of treatment time.
Comparatively, for the control and blank groups, the maximum microbial
quantity was observed at a duration of 7 d, though they show a similar
tendency to that of experimental group. For the entire procedure,
the microbial quantity of experimental group is higher than that of
control and blank groups. Accordingly, the degradation gradient is
proportional to the microbial quantity of all of the three groups
before 7 d of treatment. Afterward, the degradation gradient for control
and blank groups is still relatively stable; however, for experimental
group, the degradation gradient nearly reaches zero. That is, the
experimental group has the best degradation performance and a remarkable
degradation rate of up to 76.23% was achieved only within 7 d, which
is 49.11 and 6.22% higher than the blank and control groups, respectively.
Notably, the degradation performance of blank group is the lowest
one, where the degradation gradient remains nearly unchanged even
after 25 d of duration. To better understand the biological utilization
ability of microbial for organic substrates, we also investigated
the effect of duration time on the dehydrogenase activity and degradation
gradient of three groups. As shown in Figure 3, the curves for the three groups are closely
similar to that shown in Figure 2. The dehydrogenase activity reaches maximum in 7 d,
which is hysteretic to that of the microbial quantity (reaches maximum
in 3 d, Figure 2).
Such hysteresis may be due to the fact that the proliferation of microbial
is overwhelming in the initial stage while the increase in the dehydrogenase
activity only occurred after the propagation of the microbial.21,22 Hydrogenase oxidizes petroleum hydrocarbons by activating the hydrogen
atom of petroleum hydrocarbons and transferring it to a specific hydrogen
acceptor,23 while dehydrogenase activity
can be used to reflect the change of petroleum degradation microorganisms.
After 7 d, the dehydrogenase activity decreases with prolonging the
duration time, which is in good agreement with the tendency of that
of the microbial quantity.

gradient. Note: 1—blank
group (microbial quantity), 2—control group (microbial quantity),

(degradation gradient), 5—control group (degradation gradient),
and 6—experimental group (degradation gradient).

Figure 3 Changes in dehydrogenase activity. Note: 1—blank
group,
2—control group, and 3—experimental group.

To provide a direct observation for the changes
on the number of
microorganisms adsorbed on PMS, SEM analysis was performed and the
SEM images of PMS after different duration times are shown in Figure 4. At the initial
stage (0 d), only a few of microorganisms (the micrometer-scale papilla-like
structure) were observed on the smooth surface of polymers, which
is grafted on the CS. When the duration time reaches 6 d, the papilla-like
structure increased and densely aggregated together, that is, the
number of microorganisms adsorbed on PMS increased very quickly. In
contrast, after a duration time of 15 d, the number of microorganisms
decreased and the shape of papilla-like structure is not as regular
as that of 6 d, implying that the microorganisms are withering away.
The SEM observation is also well consistent with that of the analysis
on the microbial quantity and the degradation gradient of three groups
(Figures 2 and 3).

Figure 4 SEM images of microbial quantity.

Analysis of Dynamic Adsorption Characteristics of TPHs
Figure 5 shows the
dynamic sorption characteristics of TPHs of all three groups, and
the half-life of degradation is calculated by the equation 2  where k is the slope
of the
dynamic curve. Accordingly, the half-life of blank group, control
group, and experimental group was calculated to be 7.31, 6.22, and
5.31 days, respectively. It can be seen that the half-life of experimental
group is 2.00 and 0.91 days lower than that of blank group and control
group. Obviously, the experimental group shows the shortest half-life
among the three groups, implying the best degradation performance.24 The oil–water interface is the main active
area of microbial degradation of oil pollution, and the degree of
oil dispersion affects the degradation rate of microorganisms. The
shortening of half-life indicates that PMS can effectively increase
the contact area between microorganisms and oils,25 enabling the microorganisms to obtain more nutrients, and
accelerate the degradation of TPHs by microorganisms.

Analysis on Degradation
of n-Alkanes
Figure 6 shows the
total ion GC/MS chromatogram of standard oils containing n-alkanes and isoprene alkanes after 21 d of degradation by three
groups. Because n-alkanes and isoprene alkanes are
the main components of TPHs, the degradation of n-alkanes presents the degradation of TPHs. It is clear that the degradation
of oils with different carbon numbers is different for three groups.
For the blank group, the abundance of residual oils with a carbon
number of 15, 17, and 19 is relatively higher than those oils with
low or high carbon numbers, while for the experimental group and control
group, the oils with a carbon number ranging from 1 to 25 have high
abundance. To precisely clarify the relative percent content of each
substance in residual oils, the peak area normalization method was
employed using 44-deuterated 21 alkanes as the internal standard.
The residual amount of each n-alkane was calculated
by the absolute content of internal standard by the following equation 3  

Figure 6 Total ion GC/MS chromatogram of n-alkanes, isoprene
alkanes after degradation. Note: the substance corresponding to the
peak number is 1-n-tetradecane, 2-n-pentadecane, 3-n-hexadecath, 4-n-hexadecath, 5-pristane, 6-octadecane, 7-phytane, 8-nonadecane, 9-n-eicosane, 10-deuterated 21 alkane, 11-heneicosane, 12-docosane,
13-tricosane, 14-tetracosane, 15-pentacosane, 16-hexacosane, 17-heptacosane,
18-octacosane, 19-nonacosane, 20-triacontane, 21-hentriacontane, 22-dotriacontane,
23-triatriacontane, 24-tetratriacontane, 25-35-alkanes.

The calculated results for residual oil content
of n-alkanes are shown in Figure 7. For all n-alkanes with
carbon number ranging
from 13 to 35, the residual oil content of n-alkanes
for experimental group is lowest among the three groups, indicating
that the experimental group possesses the best degradation performance.
The degradation order of n-alkane is as follows:
experimental group > control group > blank group. These results
also
indicate that the addition of straw is beneficial to the degradation
of n-alkanes, and the degradation performance of
PMS is better than that of CS. The average degradation rate of n-alkanes with high carbon number (>C31) was
found to be 96.83%, which is the highest value, and is 3.52 and 11.28%
higher than that of control group and blank group, respectively. The
average degradation rate of n-alkanes with medium
carbon number (C21–C30) reaches 90.49%,
which is 2.02 and 18.84% higher than that of the control group and
blank group. The average degradation rate of low carbon number (C13–C20) was calculated to be 93.20%, which
is 4.34 and 23.64% higher than that of control group and blank group.
The results indicate that the loaded microorganisms using PMS as the
carrier could enhance the degradation ability of n-alkanes. Such improvement in the degradation of PMS could be attributed
to the fact that the grafting copolymers of butyl methacrylate and
styrene result in a hydrophobic modification layer on the surface
of CS, which efficiently increases the affinity for the oil molecules
and facilitates the absorption of oils on the PMS.20 On the other hand, such copolymers on PMS could also form
a space network structure, which is beneficial to the loading and
the propagation of the microorganisms, thus in turn enhancing the
degradation of n-alkanes.26

of residual oil content of n-alkanes.

Biological Evolution Characteristics of n-Alkanes
The biological evolution characteristics
of n-alkanes
were also investigated according to the total ion GC/MS chromatogram
of n-alkanes and the results are shown in Table 1. As shown in Figure 6, the abundance of
residual n-alkanes with low carbon numbers is higher
than that of n-alkanes with high carbon numbers,
that is, the main peak carbon of n-alkanes degraded
by microorganisms will move forward. This phenomenon is due to the
fact that the n-alkanes with high carbon numbers
were degraded into n-alkanes with low carbon numbers,
which in turn increase the abundance of the latter.27 In fact, such a main peak carbon of n-alkanes
moving forward is affected by other factors such as the difference
of parent source, environment, species, and degradation degree of
microorganisms.28Table 1 shows the biological
evolution parameter of n-alkanes,
compared with the blank group, the main peak carbon of the experimental
group, and the control group moved forward, which was a reflection
of the strong demethylation of high carbon number n-alkanes made by ODB adsorbed on straw. The maximum value of w(∑C21–)/w(∑C22+) of the experimental group was 0.6186, which indicates
that PMS, as a carrier of adsorption, could effectively improve the
degradation of n-alkanes with medium and high carbon
numbers. On the other hand, the bigger the ratio of w(pr)/w(ph) is, the higher the degree of redox of
TPHs by microorganisms, the better the effect of degradation of isoprene
hydrocarbon. If a change in isoprenoid occurs, it indicates that the
organic matter of oils is subject to degradation of microorganisms.29 The ratio of w(pr)/w(ph) of the experimental group and the control group was
larger than that of the blank group, which indicates that PMS promoted
the degradation of isoprene alkanes and removed a methyl group from
a partial phytane and converted it into basalane.11 The highest ratio of w(pr)/w(ph) was measured to be 0.7248 in the experimental group, the higher
the ratio, the higher the rate of alkane degradation. Therefore, PMS
as the immobilized carrier was the most effective in the degradation
of TPHs among the three groups. When microorganisms degrade TPHs,
the relative abundance of odd-carbon n-alkanes and
even carbon-n-alkanes will decrease or increase.30 The OEP value of the blank group was 0.9537,
close to 1; there is no obvious characteristic of odd–even
carbon dominance. The OEP values of the experimental group and the
control group were found to be 1.4356 and 1.2597, respectively, showing
the degradation advantage of n-alkanes with even
carbon number. This result shows that the PMS was beneficial to enhance
the degradation ability especially for even carbon number n-alkanes.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated an efficient approach for the
fabrication of PMS-ODB, which was obtained by in situ grafting copolymerization
of styrene and butyl methacrylate onto straw followed by loading of
ODB. Compared with control group, the results obtained from experimental
group show that the polymer-modified straw is beneficial to the growth
of microorganisms, and the degradation rate of TPHs reaches 90.12%.

The research of transformation characteristics of PMS-ODB shows
that the degradation rate of alkanes with low, medium, and high carbon
number is higher than 90% and calculated to be 93.20, 90.49, and 96.83%,
respectively. The mass ratio of normal alkanes of high carbon/low
carbon, the ratio of pristane/phytane, and the mass ratio of normal
alkanes of odd carbon/even carbon for TPHs in the experimental group
were measured to be 0.6186, 0.7248, and 1.4356, respectively, all
of which are the largest value among the three groups.

The findings
indicate that compared with the control, the modification
of straw could enhance the comprehensive biological degradation performance
for TPHs, even those highly stable organics such as n-alkanes with even carbon numbers and isoprenoid hydrocarbon, which
may open a new possibility for degradation of oils or toxic organics
in an enhanced biological manner.

Experimental Section
Immobilized
Bacteria Agent
Six strains of ODB which
have been screened and isolated in our group previously31 were prepared into a suspension according to
the volume ratio of 2:2:2:2:1:1 and cultured in a thermostatic incubator.
A three-stage expanded culture method was used to check the number
of colonies more than 1 × 1010 mL–1 and make the bacteria agent sealed for storage. Fixing the liquid–solid
ratio of 1:1.25, the prepared mixed bacteria solution was sprayed
on the straw evenly, cultured for 24 h, the colony number was measured
to be larger than 1 × 1010 cfu g–1, and then the immobilized bacteria agent was obtained.

Synthesis of
PMS
For the preparation of PMS, 300 mL
of deionized water and 30 g of powdered CS were added into 500 mL
of four-mouthed bottle at a temperature of 50 °C. After the introduction
of nitrogen for 10 min, a certain amount of diammonium cerium(IV)
nitrate, styrene, butyl methacrylate, and methylene-bis-acrylamide
was added into the mixture at 50 °C. After 2 h, the reaction
products were filtered under reaction temperature, washed with deionized
water and ethanol for several times, and dried under vacuum. The dried
materials were extracted with toluene to remove the homopolymers produced
during the reaction and then affording the PMS.32,33

Experimental Design
The following experiments were
designed to evaluate the degradation performance of oil pollution
by bacteria adsorbed on the straw. Blank group: TPHs were naturally
degraded by 4% standard oil. Control group: 2.5 g of CS was added
on the basis of blank group. Experimental group: on the basis of blank
group, 2.5 g of PMS was added, and 4% bacterial solution was added
according to the mass ratio of liquid phase.34 Specific treatment measures are shown in Table 2.

aseptic water, shaking, and centrifuging, the suspensions in the wastewater
were diluted by gradient, and a suitable solution with a desired dilution
degree was coated on the plate with three parallel samples for each
concentration, cultured in the incubator at 37.0 °C for 48 h,
and the colony count was counted. The degradation gradient was defined
as 4  

Determination of TPH Degradation Rate
The standard
oil curves were measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer at 226
nm, and the residual oil content and degradation rate were calculated
according to the standard equation.35 The
standard equation of TPHs is obtained as follows: 5  R2 = 0.9980, where y is the effective absorbance of the extraction solution
from oil pollution wastewater extracted by 50 mL n-hexane, dimensionless, and x is the oil concentration
of the sample, mg L–1.

Means of Material Characterization

An X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (model S4EXPLORER)
from Bruker AXS was used for semiquantitative spectral analysis, Cu
K target, graphite monochromator, 50 kV tube voltage, and 80 mA tube
current.

FT-IR
The American thermoelectric
infrared spectrometer
(model NICOLET6700 FT-IR) was used for infrared spectral analysis
and scanned the area of 500–4000 cm–1 to
compare the changes of groups under different carbonization temperatures.

SEM
The samples were sprayed with gold and fixed on
a copper platform with a conductive double-sided adhesive tape, and
a Japan Hitachi s-5200 field emission scanning electron microscope
was adopted to observe the surface morphology of the samples, the
working voltage is 0.5–30 kV, the current was 1–2 mA,
and the thickness of gold spraying was 10 nm.

Contact Angle
The static contact angle was tested with
a DSA-25S contact angle tester, the contact angle between the droplet
and the glass sheet at 25 s is the stable contact angle, and each
sample is measured seven times, and the average value is the final
contact angle.

Determination of Dehydrogenase Activity
The formula
of the standard curve drawn by UV spectrophotometry at 486 nm is 6  R2 is 0.9930.
Type: X is the triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
solution concentration and Y is the absorbance value
corresponding to each concentration of the TTC solution.

Biological
Evolution Parameter Analysis36
The main peak carbon and parameter [w(∑C21–)/w(∑C22+)] reflect
the trend of conversion from high carbon alkanes to low carbon alkanes
when alkanes are subjected to bacterial action. The higher the carbon
front of the main peak, the stronger the ability of bacteria to degrade
high carbon number alkanes. w(∑C21–)/w(∑C22+) is the ratio of the
sum of low carbon alkanes to the sum of middle and high carbon number
alkanes. The higher the value of this parameter, the stronger the
degradation ability of bacteria for high carbon number alkanes. The
OEP value reflects the ability of bacteria to degrade even and odd
carbon alkanes. The higher the OEP value is, the stronger the degradation
ability to even alkanes, indicating that the degradation ability for
even carbon is strong. The ratio of w(pr)/w(ph) is to study the redox degree of organic matter by
using the ratio of pristane to alkane in isoprene hydrocarbon. The
larger the value is, the more obvious the oxidation of isoprene hydrocarbon.
