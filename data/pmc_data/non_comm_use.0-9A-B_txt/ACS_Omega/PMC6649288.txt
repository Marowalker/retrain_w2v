To avoid the use of hydrofluoric
acid, a series of fluorinated
trivalent and tetravalent metal-containing phthalocyanines (MPcs)
were synthesized using a straightforward one-step halide substitution
process using cesium fluoride (CsF) as the fluoride source and by
reflux in N,N-dimethylformamide
for less than an hour. The resulting fluoro MPcs were characterized
and compared to the parent chloro MPcs. In some cases, very little
change in properties was observed between the fluoro MPcs and the
chloro MPcs. In other cases, such as fluoro aluminum phthalocyanine,
a blue shift in the absorbance characteristics and an increase in
oxidation and reduction potential of as much as 0.22 V was observed
compared to the chloro derivative. Thermo gravimetric analysis was
performed on all halo-MPcs, indicating that the choice of halo substitution
on the axial position can have an effect on the decomposition or sublimation
temperature of the final compound. After initial establishment and
characterization of the fluoro MPcs, the halide substitution reaction
of difluoro silicon phthalocyanine (F2-SiPc) was further
explored by scaling the reaction up to a gram scale as well as considering
tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) as an additional safe fluoride
source. The scaled-up reactions producing F2-SiPc using
CsF and TBAF as fluoride exchange sources were successfully reproducible,
resulting in reaction yields of 100 and 73%, respectively. Both processes
led to pure final products but results indicate that CsF, as the fluoride
exchange reagent, appears to be the superior reaction process as it
has a much higher yield.

==== Body
Introduction
Phthalocyanines (Pcs)
are a family of aromatic macrocycles which
can coordinate a variety of divalent, trivalent, or even tetravalent
metals.1,2 Metal-containing Pcs (MPcs) have been utilized
in a plethora of applications ranging from pigments/dyes,3,4 to active materials in organic electronics.5−8 Whereas the majority of organic
electronic studies utilize the divalent MPcs (M = Zn or Cu), a growing
interest in trivalent and tetravalent MPcs has emerged. The use of
trivalent or tetravalent metals (group 13 and group 14, respectively)
leads to one or two additional bonding opportunities to moieties such
as halide, hydroxy, phenoxy, and so forth, resulting in a series of
derivatives with ranging properties. Those synthetic modifications
allow fine-tuning of the chemical, optical, and electrophysical properties
of the MPcs without changing the aromatic structure of the Pc macrocycle;9−11 even the crystal packing can be engineered.11 Some recent examples utilizing such approaches include chloro aluminum
Pc (Cl-AlPc) and chloro gallium Pc (Cl-GaPc). These examples have
been paired with C60 for the fabrication of a bilayer and
even blended organic solar cells.12−17 Cl-AlPc and Cl-GaPc have also been used as interlayers between PEDOT:PSS
and a blended solution of poly(3,3″-didodecylquaterthiophene)
(PQT-12) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester
to form bilayer bulk heterojunction solar cells.18,19

Our group has recently found that incorporation of fluorine
groups
on boron subphthalocyanine (a class of Pcs) resulted in a change in
solid-state arrangement, a decrease in sublimation temperature, and
a change in electrochemical properties.9,20 Our interest
has since then expanded to the substitution of the chloride of group
13 and group 14 MPcs with fluoride to enable the physical study of
these materials.16,21 Through anecdotal observations,
researchers have identified that fluoro gallium Pc (F-GaPc) and fluoro
aluminum Pc (F-AlPc) have unique linear stacking motifs in the solid
state where the macrocycles overlap to form a pseudo polymer-like
arrangement, which is not the case for the respective chlorides.1,22−24 This unique solid-state stacking motif influences
the optical/absorption and electronic properties of the base AlPc
and GaPc chromophore. However, short of these two, there are very
few examples of the synthesis of axially fluorinated MPcs that can
be found in the literature. The synthesis of F-GaPc and F-AlPc (Scheme 1) was reported by
a two-step process where the chloro group III MPc was converted into
the hydroxy derivative by treating with ammonium hydroxide and pyridine
followed by the substitution of the hydroxy group with a fluorine
group using hydrofluoric acid.1,25

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Fluoro
and Difluoro Group 13 and Group 14 MPcs, Respectively
Hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas and hydrofluoric
acid are the primary
industrial sources of fluorine or fluoride for a wide range of applications,
including the synthesis of organofluoro materials and fluorinated
Pcs.25−29 Although HF is readily available, with over 1 million tons produced
annually, HF is extremely dangerous. Both forms of HF are highly corrosive
and highly caustic to human tissue, causing both acute and chronic
toxicity. HF attacks the human bone structure through the formation
of calcium fluoride, causing severely corrosive damage known as skeletal
fluorosis.30 HF has an extremely low short-term
exposure limit of 2 ppm according to the occupational exposure limits
for the Province of Ontario (Canada) workplaces.31 For this reason, safer fluorinating reagents/fluoride sources
need to be considered for relevant chemical processes.

Because
of these serious safety concerns, our group has explored
the use of fluoride salts such as cesium fluoride (CsF), sodium fluoride
(NaF), potassium fluoride (KF), or tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF)
as alternatives with minimized safety concerns.16,21 We report herein that a simple halide substitution can be performed
by heating the respective MPc chlorides within a polar aprotic organic
solvent in the presence of the fluoride salt, surpassing the use of
hydrofluoric acid,16,21 yielding the desired fluorides
of group 13 and 14 MPcs. The resulting MPc fluorides were then characterized
beyond what is currently available in the literature. Thereafter,
with a focal point of difluoro silicon phthalocyanine (F2-SiPc), the halide substitution reaction was further explored. On
the basis of detailed evaluation of safety, environmental sustainability,
cost, and performance, both CsF and TBAF emerged as the most desirable
fluoride sources to produce MPc fluorides.

Characterization
Ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis)
spectroscopy was performed using PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 with a 10
mm quartz cuvette. Cyclic voltammetry was performed using a three-electrode
cell assembly at room temperature in a 0.1 M dichloromethane and tetrabutylammonium
perchlorate (TBAP) electrolyte solution. The working electrode was
a glassy carbon disk electrode, the counter electrode was a polished
platinum wire, and the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl. An internal
standard of decamethyl ferrocene (bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)iron,
Sigma-Aldrich) as well as a scan rate of 100 mV/s was used for all
measurements. The samples were bubbled using nitrogen until no dissolved
oxygen was present (30–60 min prior to each run). Photoemission
measurements were conducted on a PHI 5500 Multitechnique system using
a monochromated Al Kα photon source (hν
= 1486.7 eV) for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and a non-monochromated
He Iα photon source (hν = 21.22 eV) for
ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Work function and valence-band
measurements were carried out using UPS with the sample tilted to
a take-off angle of 89° and under an applied bias of −15
V. The analysis chamber base pressure was ≈10–10 torr.

Results and Discussion
Initial Process Development
The synthesis of fluoro
aluminum phthalocyanine (F-AlPc), fluoro gallium phthalocyanine (F-GaPc),
difluoro silicon phthalocyanine (F2-SiPc, method (a)),
and difluoro germanium phthalocyanine (F2-GePc) was achieved
by substitution of the chloride atom within the respective precursor
with a fluoride atom by heating in a polar aprotic solvent in the
presence of a fluoride salt (Scheme 1); a method to avoid the use of hydrofluoric acid.16,21 In order to consider fluoride sources and appropriate aprotic solvents,
a literature survey on the solubility of various fluoride salts in
multiple aprotic solvents was conducted to ensure maximum concentration
and, therefore, reactivity of the fluorides in solution. Many publications
detail the solubilities of halide salts in various solvents such as
formamide, N-methylformamide, acetamide, N-methylacetamide, acetonitrile, DMF, N,N-dimethylacetamide, and DMSO; the data are presented
in Tables S1.1–S1.5.2−4,6,25,26,35−39 After such a survey, DMF was identified as the solvent with the
highest fluoride salt solubility varying from 1 mg/kg for NaF to 96
mg/kg for CsF.

We had previously developed a simple thermodynamic
model to examine and predict the spontaneity of the phenoxylation
reaction of multiple chloro Pc derivatives.40 Here, we developed a similar thermodynamic model for the halide
exchange reaction for the chloro/dichloro MPcs of interest, using
different cesium halide salts (i.e., CsF, CsBr, and CsI, eq 1). The model enables the consideration
of a thermodynamic driving force for the halide exchange alongside
solubility considerations. The premise of the model is the assumption
that enthalpy of reaction (ΔHR)
is solely dependent on the bond dissociation/formation energies of
the bonds involved in the reaction with a negligible change in entropy.
At constant entropy, the sign and magnitude of ΔHR can indicate at least qualitatively the spontaneity
of the reaction (large negative values being spontaneous). ΔHR were calculated using bond dissociation (formation)
energies.41 ΔHA–B is the bond dissociation (formation) energy between
atom A and atom B. 1  

On the basis of the model,
thermodynamically the exchange of chloride
with fluoride is highly favorable. Fluorination of any of the chloro
derivatives using CsF was then expected to be spontaneous because
of the largely negative calculated values of ΔHR (Figure 1). Experimental results support this conclusion. The synthesis of
F-AlPc, F-GaPc, F2-SiPc, and F2-GePc was easily
accomplished in a short time by substitution of chloride with fluoride
by heating the respective chloride precursors in DMF in the presence
of CsF (Scheme 1).16,21 Whereas the yields of producing F-AlPc, F2-SiPc, and
F2-GePc using this chemistry were high (≈70–80%),
the yield of producing F-GaPc under the same conditions was very small
(<5%). Because ΔHR of the fluoride
exchange of Cl-GaPc is negative and large in magnitude (although much
lower than that of Cl-AlPc) the reaction was still expected to be
thermodynamically favorable and therefore must have been kinetically
limited. One of the methods employed to overcome this kinetic limitation
was to change the solvent properties to encourage the dissolution
of CsCl and increase the solubility of CsF, which would increase the
likelihood of reaction and reduce the probability for the reverse
reaction. The addition of crown ethers has been known to favorably
increase the fluoride salt’s solubility compared to the chloride
salt and was therefore explored for the efficient synthesis of F-GaPc.42,43 We determined that the addition of 1 equiv (to the CsF) of dicyclohexano-18-crown-6,
under consistent reaction conditions, resulted in the complete synthesis
of F-GaPc at high yield (>70%).

Figure 1 Estimated enthalpy of halogen exchange
reactions (ΔHR) for different chloro/dichloro
MPcs.

ΔHR was also calculated for the
fluoride exchange reaction using HF, the reactant we are aiming to
avoid. The thermodynamic force for HF is clearly lower than that of
the reaction using CsF. Although the reactions of Cl-GaPc and Cl2-GePc was seen as thermodynamically unfavorable, the small
magnitude of ΔHR (<20 kJ/mol)
is well within the uncertainties of many of the used bond dissociation
(formation) energies. Another interesting observation resulting from
the model is whereas the bromination of the chloro derivatives is
expected to be unfavorable as bromides are stronger leaving groups
than chlorides, the bromination of Cl2-GePc seems slightly
favorable. Again, the magnitude of ΔHR is small, causing uncertainty over the thermodynamic favorability
of this reaction.

These synthetic and model results overall
indicate a straightforward
and versatile method for obtaining analytically pure fluoro and difluoro
group III and group IV MPcs at high yields, without the need to use
a hazardous chemical such as hydrofluoric acid. CAUTION: Should one consider variations in this process, be cautious as the
use of acids in this process, even during workup and isolation of
product, increases the risk of producing HF as a by-/side-product.
This can/could result in releasing HF to the surrounding environment
and increase the chance of human exposure without proper waste management
or other process considerations.44,45

Optical Characterization
After synthesis and purification,
UV–vis spectroscopy was performed on F-AlPc, F-GaPc, F2-SiPc, and F2-GePc, along with their respective
chloride starting materials as a point of comparison. The characterization
of the AlPc derivatives has been previously reported and therefore
was reproduced for ease of comparison.16,21 All compounds
were analyzed in DMSO, chloroform, and toluene because of ranging
solubilities and for comparison. The optical band gap and max absorbance
(λmax) were determined from the absorbance spectra
and are compiled in Table S2. Figure 2 shows the characteristic
normalized absorption spectra of the axial fluorinated versus chlorinated
MPcs (M = Al, Ga, Si, and Ge) in DMSO solution. The maximum absorbance
of Cl2-SiPc is almost identical to that of F2-SiPc (Table S2, Figure 2b). Unlike for F2-SiPc, the peak
absorption of F-AlPc is slightly blue shifted compared to the chlorinated
material (Figure 2a);16 this small blue shift in absorbance corresponds
to an increase in optical bang gap from Eg,opt = 1.78 eV to Eg,opt = 1.81 eV, for Cl-AlPc
to F-AlPc, respectively (Table S2).16 As a point of comparison, these results are
consistent with the literature values for halo boron subphthalocyanines
(BsubPcs), where little change was observed in the maximum absorbance
of Cl-BsubPc and F-BsubPc, at 565 and 562 nm respectively.9 No significant change in the maximum absorbance
peaks was found for the Ga- and Ge-based MPcs comparing the fluoride
to chloride derivatives (Figure 2c,d). Figure 3 illustrates the effect of solvent on the absorbance of F2-SiPc and F-AlPc, each dissolved in DMSO, chloroform, and
toluene. Of the three solvents used, DMSO was found to be the most
effective in consistently solubilizing each material, whereas some
compounds were slightly soluble in chloroform and most were only sparingly
soluble in toluene. The broad absorption spectrum is indicative of
the insolubility and formation of a dispersion in toluene. When examining Figure 3a, it is apparent
that a small change in the maximum absorbance for F2-SiPc
is observed between that of DMSO, with λmax = 699
nm, and chloroform, with λmax = 694 nm. Similarly,
F-AlPc experienced a slight red shift with chloroform, with λmax = 688 nm, compared to DMSO with λmax =
671 nm. These results illustrate that the fluoride exchange of trivalent
and tetravalent MPcs translates to only a small red shift of up to
9 nm. Second, the use of various solvents for the analysis on the
absorbance can change the solubility of the product, resulting in
a fluctuation in λmax of up to 19 nm.

Electrochemical Characterization
The fluoro/difluoro
MPcs and, as a comparison, the corresponding chloro-/dichloro MPcs
were then characterized by cyclic voltammetry. An overview of the
electrochemical results can be found in Table S3. Because of limited solubility, in general electrochemical
signals were weak but for each result a peak oxidation or reduction
potential could be identified. However, the weak signals prevented
the identification of half-wave oxidation or reduction potentials.
In all cases, the oxidation peak (EOX,peak) is observed at a reduced potential of up to ≈0.2 V for the
fluoride MPc derivative compared to the respective chloride MPc derivative.
For example, F-AlPc exhibited an EOX,peak = 1.18 V and ERed,peak = −0.81
V where the Cl-AlPc exhibited an EOX,peak = 1.40 V and ERed,peak = −0.71
V (Table S3, Figure 4A,B). Some compounds experienced less significant
changes in electrochemical characteristics, for example F2-SiPc exhibited an EOX,peak = 1.23 V
and ERed,peak = −0.63 V, where
the Cl2-SiPc exhibited an EOX,peak = 1.27 V and ERed,peak = −0.74
V (Table S3, Figure 4C,D). We previously reported a similar decrease
in oxidation potential of 0.05 V between chloro boron subphthalocyanine
(Cl-BsubPc) and fluoro boron subphthalocyanine (F-BsubPc).9

scanning and (D) reductive scanning of Cl2-SiPc and F2-SiPc. Electrochemistry was performed at a 100 mV/s scan rate
(three cycles) using a reference electrode of Ag/AgCl and internal
standard of decamethyl ferrocene.

UPS Characterization
To verify the abovementioned trends,
UPS was employed to firmly determine the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the chloro and fluoro MPcs as thin
solid films. The pure compounds were deposited by sublimation on freshly
cleaved highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, and the results were aligned
to its vacuum level work function at 4.45 eV. In all cases, between
12 and 13 nm of Pc was deposited on the sample to avoid the potential
screening of photohole generated in the organic layer by the conductive
substrate in ultrathin layer and to give a strong signal to noise
ratio.46 The densities of states corresponding
to the EHOMO are represented by the peaks
at the lowest binding energy of the valence band spectra for each
compound (Figure 5)
and the corresponding ionization energies or EHOMO and the work functions determined by UPS (ΦUPS) and XPS (ΦXPS) can all be found in Table S3. The peaks in the UPS spectra, between
6 and 12 eV, correspond to the binding energies for the orbitals of
the isoindoline groups, which are common for all MPcs.46−48 The valence band structure is defined by the d-orbitals from the central metal chelated by four nitrogen groups
and the corresponding binding energies are located between 0 and 6
eV.46−48 In general, very little change in the valence structure
is observed when substituting the chelating metal.46−48 When studying
the values, it becomes apparent that in some cases such as AlPc16 and GePc, the substitution of fluoride for chloride
results in a significant change in ΦUPS and ultimately EHOMO, whereas in the other cases, such as SiPc
and GaPc, very little change was observed. For example, an increase
of EHOMO of as much as ≈1.0 eV
was observed between Cl-AlPc (EHOMO =
−5.7 eV) and F-AlPc (EHOMO = −4.7
eV)16 and as much as ≈1.5 eV was
observed between Cl2-GePc (EHOMO = −5.8 eV) and F2-GePc (EHOMO = −4.3 eV), respectively. In comparison, however,
very little difference was observed between Cl2-SiPc (EHOMO = −5.7 eV) and F2-SiPc
(EHOMO = −5.6 eV) or between Cl-GaPc
(EHOMO = −5.7 eV) and F-GaPc (EHOMO = −5.6 eV). Finally, it is important
to note that ΦUPS ≈ ΦXPS,
confirming the trend in values, with the exception of F-AlPc.

function, of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, at 4.45 eV. As a comparison,
Cl-AlPc and F-AlPc were taken from Lessard et al.16

Thermo Gravimetric Analysis
Thermo gravimetric analysis
(TGA) was performed on both the chloro and the fluoro MPcs (Al, Ge,
Ga, Si). The corresponding traces for the % mass loss and derivative
of mass loss with respect to temperature can be found in Figure 6. What is interesting
to note is that the mass loss profiles between the chloro and fluoro
derivatives are uniformly different. For example, F-AlPc appears to
exhibit no mass loss until roughly 625 °C, whereas Cl-AlPc begins
to experience significant mass loss at 550 °C (Figure 6A).16 These results indicate that the substitution of the axial chloride
group for a fluoride group can have an effect on the decomposition
temperature and possibly the sublimation temperature of these compounds.

and F-GaPc (D) Cl2-GePc and F2-GePc. As a comparison,

Additional Process Improvement
After establishing the
synthesis and characterization of this variety of fluoro MPcs, we
were interested to further refine the process or consider alternative
factors aside from DMF and CsF. We decided to further explore the
process chemistry with the focal point of F2-SiPc, not
just relevant to the dye and pigment industry but also because SiPcs
have recently shown functionality in organic electronic devices such
as OPVs37 and OLEDs,34 which are emerging technologies. Further justifying this
aspect of the study, through kinetic Monte Carlo simulations based
on experimental X-ray structures, Gali et al. identified that F2-SiPc is expected to exhibit ambipolar semiconducting behavior,
with hole and electron mobilities lying in the range 0.1–1
cm2 V–1 s–1.49

For initial process optimization and improvement
consideration, we considered alternative fluoride sources and solvents
while taking into account safety of the reagents, potential environmental
damage caused by the waste/by-products, and the cost of the reagents.
Because of their abundance and low costs, fluorinated salts are good
reactants for this synthetic process;50 although they are still derived from HF, safety hazards are reduced
as the acid is only handled in the large-scale facilities during salt
production.

For this study extension, the following extra fluoride
salts were
considered along with CsF to execute the fluoride exchange of Cl2-SiPc: KF, TBAF, and (diethylamino) difluorosulfonium tetrafluoroborate
(XtalFluor-E). As mentioned above, CsF, as compared to KF or NaF,
is the most soluble in organic polar aprotic solvents (Tables S1.1–S1.5), providing better reaction
conditions. Cesium has the lowest electronegativity of all nonradioactive
elements and fluorine the highest, thus qualifying the noncovalent
compound as an ideal fluorinating reagent for this reaction. Furthermore,
fluoride reactivity in aprotic solvents is as follows: CsF > KF
≫
NaF. KF, with similar benefits as CsF, has also been explored as a
promising fluorinating reagent.51 Anhydrous
TBAF has demonstrated nucleophilic aromatic substitution of chlorine
elements in DMSO.51 TBAF is a more environmentally
sustainable fluorinating reagent as compared to CsF and KF51 and was therefore also considered as a fluoride
source. Finally, XtalFluor-E is a commercialized crystalline fluorinated
salt that was designed to completely mitigate the production of HF,
providing for safer reaction conditions comparatively. XtalFluor-E
has successfully been used as a fluorinating reagent for alcohols
and carbonyls, such as aldehydes and ketones.52

Three polar aprotic solvents were explored; DMF, N-methylpyrrolidine (NMP), and DMSO. Despite polar aprotic solvents
being the most common for this type of reaction, research shows that
the H-bonding network of a protic solvent can be manipulated through
the use of additives to further optimize the production of halogenated
MPcs.50,53 Through hydrogen bonding, protic solvents,
including water, aqueous solutions, and alcohol, bind with the anionic
nucleophiles.50 Solvent slurries (50% water)
were therefore also explored. The use of water reduces the amount
of solvent required and thus reduces the amount of environmental waste
produced by this reaction. In addition, when the chloride atoms are
released from Cl2-SiPc, it is possible that the presence
of water will draw them out and act as a proactive purifying system.
Lee et al. demonstrate successful nucleophilic fluoride reactions
using an ionic liquid (IL).50 ILs, such
as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim][BF4]), are highly polarized ionic compounds, and can in fact help the
dissolution of salts in organic solvents.50 [bmim][BF4] is also known as a reusable/recyclable solvent,
and thus was also explored for the synthesis of F2-SiPc.

First Screening of Conversion to F2-SiPc
We performed
a series of fluoride exchange reactions under similar
conditions, as identified in the Experimental Section, while substituting the solvents or the fluoride sources. The process
conditions as well as the experimental results are compiled in Table 1. The success of the
reaction was scanned by the presence of F2-SiPc in associated
mass spectra. We found that CsF, KF, TBAF, and XtalFluor-E all successfully
produce F2-SiPc in DMF and that CsF and TBAF can be used
in DMSO. We also found that the use of [bmim][BF4] as a
solvent also resulted in the formation of F2-SiPc. Of these,
reactions 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9 showed no peaks for Cl2-SiPc,
indicating full conversion (Table 1). Reactions 8, 10, and 11, which include the use of
a water slurry as a solvent, demonstrate no presence of F2-SiPc, but displayed the presence of F-SiPc+ fragment
peaks, indicating potential incomplete conversion to F2-SiPc and the presence of the intermediate (F)(Cl)-SiPc.

Toxicology and Environmental Considerations
NMP, DMF,
and DMSO have very similar solvent properties, all being polar aprotic
solvents with high boiling points and similar vapor pressures. From
a toxicological point of view, DMSO is considered much safer than
NMP and DMF. Unlike NMP, DMSO does not qualify as a reproductive toxin,
nor is it under Proposition 65 in the United States as a developmental
toxin.54 DMSO also presents having much
higher lethal doses than NMP, for example, having a dermal LD-50 of
40 g/kg rat as compared to NMP having a dermal LD-50 of 8 g/kg rabbit.54 Having higher oral, dermal, and inhalation exposure
lethal doses further justifies the use of DMSO. Unlike DMSO, NMP qualifies
under the SARA Title III §313 Community Right-to-Know Program
in Georgia, which requires reports of both routine and accidental
chemical releases to be submitted to the Environmental Protection
Agency and the state Emergency Response System.54 Furthermore, NMP was recently investigated by the Government
of Canada under the Chemicals Management Plan.54 The government proposed that NMP is not harmful to the
environment at the current levels of exposure; however, at higher
levels of exposure, it is concerned about its environmental spread
and developmental toxicity.54 These investigations
and levels of concern demonstrate the negative impact that these solvents
can have on the environment. Using an environmentally friendly solvent
is of high interest. As outlined, from a toxicological and ecological
point of view, DMSO is the most suitable solvent available. It has
a health hazard of 0, does not qualify as a reproductive toxin, and
is not under investigation as an environmental hazard. On the basis
of this research, DMSO is the least harmful solvent from among the
group of polar aprotic solvents considered in this experiment.

Although the health hazards associated with [bmim][BF4] are more significant than those of DMSO, it can be considered a
green solvent because of its ease of recyclability55 and negligible evaporation because of very low vapor pressure
of <0.000094 mmHg.56 NMP, DMF, and DMSO
qualify as volatile organic compounds and therefore if properly recycled
the use of [bmim][BF4] could be beneficial. Certain ILs
have been reused up to four times without losing their purity.55 However, it is important to note that the precipitation
of F2-SiPc from [bmim][BF4] required the need
for dichloromethane and isopropanol, which do not have non-negligible
environmental effects.57,58

The four fluoride sources,
CsF, KF, TBAF, and XtalFluor-E, produced
F2-SiPC peaks when reacted in DMF with Cl2–SiPc.
Both CsF and TBAF underwent complete conversion, as compared to KF
and XtalFluor-E, which both demonstrated the presence of Cl2-SiPc. All aforementioned reactions followed the same experimental
design process, thus each having the same level of design simplicity.
CsF and TBAF are slightly advantageous over KF and XtalFluor-E because
of their display of complete conversion.

All four fluorinating
reagents have negligible flammability and
physical hazard. CsF, KF, and XtalFluor-E, under the Workplace Hazardous
Materials Information System (WHMIS) classification, are D1B, indicating
that they are toxic materials causing immediate and serious toxic
effect through ingestion, skin absorption, and inhalation.59−61 Furthermore, CsF falls under the WHMIS classifications D2A and D2B,
indicating that it is a very toxic material causing other side effects
including being a reproductive hazard, moderate skin irritant, and
severe eye irritant.60 TBAF is much less
dangerous, categorized under the WHMIS classification E, indicating
that it is a corrosive material.62 All
four fluorinated salts have similar storage conditions with the exception
of XtalFluor-E, which requires refrigeration.59−62 XtalFluor-E is a commercially
developed fluorinating reagent, compatible with borosilicate glassware,
and designed not to produce HF.53 As compared
to diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST) and DeoxoFluor, previously
designed fluorinating reagents, XtalFluor salts have better handling
properties, a significantly reduced reaction with water, and a more
stable decomposition temperature of 215 °C.63 However, despite XtalFluor-E being popular because of mitigating
the production of HF, under acidic conditions, this salt produces
tetrafluoroboric acid, HBF4.63 which is still a hazardous and highly corrosive material.64,65 Furthermore, XtalFluor-E is designed to only be exposed to the atmosphere
for short periods of time because of safety risks.61 Taking into consideration the compounds’ individual
safety risks and the production risk of HF and HBF4, TBAF
appears to be the safest available compound for the production of
F2-SiPc.

Very little ecological information is available
for the fluoride
sources. Fluorides exist in the environment most commonly as HF or
very small particles.66 These compounds
typically remain air bound, settle to the ground, or are washed out
by rain and incorporated into the hydrological cycle.66 Fluoride typically accumulates in plants as well as animals
that consume those plants.66 It is important
to control and mitigate the exposure of fluorine to the environment.
All four fluorinating reagents pose similar risks to the environment.

We performed a preliminary cost analysis for both the solvent and
the fluoride source. For a comprehensive analysis to be performed
several factors that affect the cost of purchasing a reagent would
be needed, such as (but not limited to) transportation costs, storage
costs, process costs, taxes, intellectual property and licensing costs,
and costs associated with safety and spill containment. Therefore,
for our analysis we averaged the purchasing cost of four different
chemical suppliers. We found that DMSO is roughly 2 and 11% more expensive
than DMF and NMP, respectively; [bmim][BF4] on the other
hand is roughly 12 000% more expensive than DMSO. Unless the
[bmim][BF4] can be effectively recycled, we find it hard
to believe that this can be a financially acceptable alternative.
For the fluorinating reagents CsF and KF were both found to be roughly
60% more expensive than TBAF, whereas XtalFluor-E is roughly 1200%
more expensive than TBAF. The elevated cost of XtalFluor-E is likely
unacceptable unless the production of HF using TBAF is a significant
problem, and a treatment of the waste stream is not possible.

Final
Process Considerations and Opinions
Taking into
account the experimentally verified conversion to F2-SiPc,
the environmental and health considerations, and financial analysis,
we proposed DMSO and TBAF as the optimized processes reagent and solvent
for the conversion of Cl2-SiPc and F2-SiPc.

Although DMSO is not the cheapest available solvent, its costs are
similar to both NMP and DMF and are predicted to decline as DMSO becomes
more popular because of its nontoxic and biodegradable properties.67 Furthermore, there are companies that offer
their service to recover, refine, and convert DMSO into a reusable
solvent for further production processes (Toray Fine Chemicals Co.,
Ltd.). As a reusable solvent, DMSO contributes to the reduction of
chemical waste and environmental preservation. The global consumption
of DMSO is expected to increase between 2016 and 2026.67 DMSO is commonly used in many industries including
agrochemicals, electronics, fine chemicals, coatings, and cleaning
supplies.67 Furthermore, the growth of
the DMSO market will be further advanced by recent demand for it in
pharmaceutical applications.67 DMSO is
used worldwide, with North America being the largest consumer.67 These factors qualify DMSO as a readily available
solvent, with relative certainty that the market will continue to
grow and be supplied.

From an experimental standpoint, TBAF
enabled complete conversion
to F2-SiPc when reacted with Cl2-SiPc, unlike
XtalFluor-E and KF. Furthermore, TBAF is the most cost-effective fluorinating
reagent. From a toxicological and ecological point of view, TBAF is
the most suitable fluorinating reagent available. TBAF is classified
as an organometallic compound that is commonly used in research and
industrial chemistry. The global TBAF market has grown significantly
since 2016 and production costs are predicted to decrease in the future
because of the application of alternate energy sources.68

With the availability of upstream raw
materials and downstream
demand for both DMSO and TBAF, this reaction design is feasible with
a financially stable future. The availability of these products is
also supportive of scaling up the process to an industrial level.
In conclusion, the recommended process design for the production of
F2-SiPc involves reacting Cl2-SiPc with TBAF
in DMSO. This reaction optimizes safety factors and reduces negative
environmental impact, while being a financially sustainable reaction
with feasible promise to be maintained and scaled to an industrial
level.

Conclusions
A series of fluorinated
trivalent and tetravalent MPcs were synthesized
using a straightforward one-step halide substitution reaction with
CsF as a fluoride source. F-AlPc, F2-SiPc, and F2-GePc were synthesized by reflux in DMF for less than an hour, whereas
the synthesis of F-GaPc required the addition of a crown ether to
increase the solubility of CsF and reduce the solubility of CsCl.
In all four cases, high purity and high yields were obtained with
very simple purification techniques.

The absorbance properties
of both the chloro and fluoro derivatives
in a variety of solvents were determined and compared. In some cases,
no changes were observed and in others, such as F-AlPc, a significant
blue shift in the absorbance was observed compared to the chloro derivative.
Electrochemical characterization of the chloro and fluoro derivatives
was also performed, observing an increase in potential between 0.05
and 0.22 V for the fluoro derivatives compared to the chloro derivatives.
The most significant change in oxidation potential was observed between
F-AlPc and Cl-AlPc. UPS and XPS both identify, in some cases such
as the change from Cl-AlPc to F-AlPc or Cl2-GePc to F2-GePc, a significant change in work function and EHOMO. However, very little change in work function or EHOMO was observed when comparing Cl-GaPc to
F-GaPc or from Cl2-SiPc to F2-SiPc. TGA was
performed on all MPcs. It was observed that the mass loss profile
between the chloride and fluoride derivatives are different, indicating
that the choice of halide substitution on the axial position changes
the decomposition and sublimation temperature.

As a final consideration,
we have concluded that the combination
of TBAF and DMSO is the most optimized fluoride exchange reaction
based on several factors including environmental impact, health and
hazard on exposure, and economics. However, it must be noted that
CsF as a fluoride source did result in a higher mass yield. This was
supported by the successful results achieved from the fluoride exchange
of Cl2-SiPc to F2-SiPc using CsF and TBAF in
DMF and DMSO solvents, respectively.
