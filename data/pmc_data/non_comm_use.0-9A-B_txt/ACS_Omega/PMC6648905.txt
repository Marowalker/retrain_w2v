An
Au/K bicatalyst-assisted chemical vapor deposition process using
C2H2(g) to grow high-density carbon nanocoils
(CNCs) uniformly on the fibers in carbon fiber cloth substrates three-dimensionally
was developed. An as-deposited substrate (2.5 × 1.0 cm2) showed a high electrochemical active surface area (16.53 cm2), suggesting its potential usefulness as the electrode in
electrochemical devices. The unique one-dimensional (1D) helical structure
of the CNCs shortened the diffusion pathways of the ions in the electrolyte
and generated efficient electron conduction routes so that the observed
serial resistance Rs was low (3.7 Ω).
By employing two-electrode systems, a liquid-state supercapacitor
(SC) in H2SO4(aq) (1.0 M) and a solid-state
SC with a polypropylene (PP) separator immersed in H2SO4(aq) (1.0 M)/polyvinylalcohol were assembled and investigated
by using CNC-based electrodes. Both devices exhibited approximate
rectangular shape profiles in the cyclic voltammetry measurements
at various scan rates. The observations indicated their electric double-layer
capacitive behaviors. From their galvanostatic charge/discharge curves,
the specific capacitances of the liquid SC and the solid SC were measured
to be approximately 137 and 163 F/g, respectively. In addition, the
solid-state CNC-based SC possessed excellent energy density (15.3
W h/kg) and power density (510 W/kg). The light weight solid SC (0.1965
g, 2.5 × 1.0 cm2) was bendable up to 150° with
most of the properties retained.

1 Introduction
Portable
and wearable devices, such as mobile phones, tablet computers,
flexible displays, and biosensors, have flourished over the past decade.1−4 Thus, the development of energy storage devices is urgently required
to meet these specific applications. Supercapacitors (SCs), an emerging
class of energy storage devices, attract tremendous attention. They
provide fast charge/discharge rates, high power densities, and long
cycling life.5,6 Depending on different charge
storage routes, SCs can be categorized into pseudocapacitors and electric
double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). Pseudocapacitors store energy based
on reversible Faradic redox reactions between the electrolyte and
the electrode surface. On the other hand, EDLC devices store energy
by charging and discharging the interface between the electrode surface
and the electrolyte. Therefore, without chemical reactions, the EDLC
devices exhibit extraordinary stability and reversibility in repeated
charge/discharge cycles.7,8 Recently, a variety
of all-carbon SCs are reported because of their thermal stability
and chemical inertness in the environment.9,10 Here,
the applied electrode materials include carbon nanotube (CNT), reduced
graphene oxide, and carbon fiber (CF) composites.10−17

In addition to the carbon-based materials mentioned above,
a unique
class of one-dimensional (1D) carbon material known as carbon nanocoils
(CNCs) has also been developed.18−22 Because of their unique morphology, they provide high specific surface
areas. For example, a value 105 m2/g was reported for pristine
CNCs.23 The result is much superior to
those of similar electrospun carbon nanofibers, 10–30 m2/g. Also, it is comparable to the value of a CNT sample, 272
m2/g.24 The 1D structure of
the CNCs not only offers high electrical conductivities 20–200
S/m but also allows more of the electrode material to penetrate deeply
inside the electrolyte.25,26 The increased electrolyte/electrode
contact reduces the interfacial resistance as well.27 The drawbacks of the traditional growth of CNCs by chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) include the needs of high growth temperatures
and magnetic transition metal catalysts.21

Previously, we reported that by using Ag/K and Au/K cooperative
bicatalysts, high-density CNCs were grown on the surfaces of Si and
graphite foil substrates, respectively, by CVD at a relatively low
temperature 723 K employing C2H2(g) as the precursor.28,29 The process provides possibility to grow nonmagnetic CNCs on substrates
that may not sustain under high-temperature processing. To broaden
the usefulness of the CNCs, we envision that growing CNCs by CVD three-dimensionally
inside the vacant space of a common CF woven cloth would provide a
high surface area electrode for electrochemical devices. In order
to achieve this goal, we employ our previous bicatalyst CVD process
for the fabrication. It is further improved so that the nanoparticles
(NPs) of both Au and K can be grown conformally deep inside on all
fibers of the CF cloth (CFC). Here, we report our findings on the
development of this new CVD process for the growth of CNCs inside
the CFC substrate. We discover that the substrate can be applied as
an electrochemical electrode for high-performance SC devices.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Growth of CNCs
A process was developed
to deposit Au NPs and K(l) catalysts conformally on CFC
substrates so that CNCs would grow three-dimensionally inside the
substrates via a vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) type reaction
pathway.28−30 To a cleaned CFC, a thin Au layer was grown on both
sides by e-gun physical vapor deposition (PVD) (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). In the later high temperature
steps, the Au layer was transformed into Au NPs. To increase the density
of Au NPs inside the cloth, it was further immersed in HAuCl4(aq) followed by H2(g) reduction at 443 K. Then, the CFs of
the substrate were coated uniformly with K(l) evaporated
at 443 K. C2H2(g) and H2(g) were
introduced to grow CNCs via the Au/K bicatalyst-assisted VLS mechanism.
The overall fabrication process is displayed in Scheme 1. The substrate with the as-deposited brown
product was washed and dried to offer the CNC-based electrode (see
Figure S2 and Experimental Parameter Optimization in the Supporting Information).

of the Fabrication Process of CNCs-Based Electrodes
2.2 Characterizations of CNCs
The as-fabricated
electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
studies (Figure 1).
The image in Figure 1A reveals the successful 3D growth of high-density CNCs on CFC. As
shown in Figure 1B,
CNCs with diameters of 100–300 nm and lengths of tens of micrometers
were grown. In the inset of Figure 1B, a high-magnification image exhibits some creases
on the CNC surface. The cross-sectional images of the as-grown CNCs
on the edge of the CFC substrate sample are shown in Figure 1C,D. The result confirms that
the Au NPs and K(l) catalysts were effectively deposited
on all surface of fibers. On a particular CNC shown in Figure 1E, the energy dispersive spectroscopic
(EDS) signals from both Au and K are observed (Figure 1F). The role of the catalysts and the details
of the growth mechanism will be discussed more below.

image of the CNCs (inset: detailed morphology of a CNC), and (C) low-
and (D) high-magnification images from the cross-sectional edge of
the substrate showing lots of CNCs. (E) High-magnification image of
an individual CNC and (F) EDS data from the tip.

A typical braidlike CNC, shown in Figure 2A, was characterized by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). It tightly spirals with a uniform coil diameter
of ca. 80 nm and a pitch of ca. 60 nm. The selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern in the upper left inset of Figure 2A exhibits diffused diffraction
rings corresponding to lattice spacing values 0.34, 0.22, and 0.13
nm. These are assigned to (002), (100), and (110) planes of less-ordered
graphitic carbon (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards,
JCPDS file no. 75-1621). A NP with a diameter ca. 40 nm is found at
the tip of the coil. In the lower right inset of Figure 2A, a clear dot pattern from
the NP is observed. By corresponding the dots to the (111), (200),
and (11̅1̅) planes of a face-centered cubic structure,
the lattice parameter a is estimated to be 0.41 nm
(JCPDS file no. 04-0784). The high-resolution TEM image of the NP
in Figure 2B shows
well-defined fringes corresponding to lattice spacing values 0.23,
0.23, and 0.20 nm. They are assigned to (111), (11̅1̅),
and (200) planes of Au. As displayed in Figure 2C, the EDS mapping of the red rectangle area
in Figure 2A shows
the signals from Au and C atoms. Clearly, the observation confirms
that the whole Au NP is enclosed in a carbon matrix.

braidlike CNC. (A) Image of the tip of
the CNC and (insets) SAED patterns from the squared regions, (B) HR
image of the tip, and (C) EDS mapping from the red squared region
in (A).

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of a pristine CFC substrate
and the as-fabricated CNC-based electrode are presented in Figure
S3 in the Supporting Information. Both
samples show patterns from a reported hexagonal carbon structure (JCPDS
file no. 26-1076). They demonstrate characteristic 2θ peaks
of (006) and other super-lattice planes of the unique carbon material.
In addition, the pattern of the as-fabricated CNC-based electrode
displays more peaks at 38.0°, 44.2°, 64.4°, and 77.4°.
They correspond to (111), (200), (220) and (311) spacing of metallic
Au (JCPDS file no. 04-0784), respectively. It is worth noting that
the peak at 25.6° of the CNC-based electrode broadens significantly.
This implies that in addition to the CFC substrate, the sample consists
of a less-ordered carbon material. The observation agrees with the
results from the TEM studies mentioned above. The Raman spectra of
the samples are presented in Figure S4.
Two signature peaks at 1350 cm–1 (D band) and 1580
cm–1 (G band) are observed for both carbon samples.
In addition, the CFC substrate displays 2D band (G′ band) and
D′ band. Although the ratio of the intensity of the D/G bands
is higher for the CNC electrode, the broad D band and its lack of
2D band suggest that the CNCs are less-ordered carbon.10,31,32 This agrees with the TEM and
the XRD observation. Both samples were investigated by thermogravimetric
analyses (TGA) shown in Figure S5. The
mass loss of CFC is observed at ca. 850 K. On the other hand, the
CNC electrode shows two mass drops at ca. 600 and 800 K. Consequently,
the 15.8% mass-loss at 600 K is assigned to the vanishing of the less-ordered
CNCs while the one at 800 K is attributed to the CFC. From this result,
the mass loading of CNCs in the electrode (0.019 g, 2.5 × 1.0
cm2) is estimated to be 3.0 × 10–3 g. The thermal stability of the CNC electrode agrees with the structural
difference between the CNCs and substrates discussed in the XRD and
the Raman studies above.33

Previously,
we developed CVD processes to grow CNCs from C2H2(g) on Si and graphite substrates using K(l) and NPs of Ag
or Au as the catalysts.28,29 We anticipated that
a similar route could be applied to grow CNCs
on CFC too. However, by using the experimental steps shown in Figure
S6 in the Supporting Information, we discovered
that CNCs grew only as a thin layer on the top of the substrate surface,
as shown in Figure S7. When a CFC with
both sides coated with K(l) and Au NPs were placed vertically
in the reactor, thin layers of CNCs were grown only on two surfaces
of the substrate. No carbon nanostructures were observed inside the
CFC (Figure S8). This observation is attributed
to the absence of Au or K catalysts in the interior of the CFC. Another
possibility is that the precursor molecules did not diffuse effectively
inside the CFC. As displayed in Figure S9, K signals were detected on the surface of CFs in the cloth by EDS.
This suggests that K atoms, one of the catalysts, covered all CF surfaces
evenly. On the other hand, as shown by the SEM image and the EDS data
in Figure S10, the PVD Au layer did not
grow uniformly on every CF, especially the ones inside the cloth.
This is due to the shadow effect from the PVD process.34−36 We conclude that high-density Au NPs must be deposited homogeneously
on all fibers of the substrate to assist the uniform growth of CNCs
inside the CFC. An improved process was developed to accomplish this
goal. As shown in the steps depicted in Scheme 1, this was achieved by further impregnating
the CFC substrates coated with a layer of PVD Au into a HAuCl4(aq) solution followed by thermal reduction in H2(g) at 443 K. As described in the Supporting Information, a set of optimized reaction conditions were determined (see Experimental
Parameter Optimization, Figures S11–S16, and Table S1). Under this condition,
sample 8, with the densest and longest CNCs on all CFs of the substrate,
is selected as the CNC-based electrode for the SC studies. In Figure
S17 in the Supporting Information, the
cross-sectional SEM image and the EDS characterization of the interior
of the processed CFC reveal the even growth of Au NPs by the improved
process.

2.3 Electrochemical Performances of the CNC-Based
Electrode
In general, the capacitance of an EDLC depends
on the number of active sites for electrolyte ion storage. In other
words, the EDLC capacitance is determined by the surface area provided
by the geometrical structure of the device. Large specific surface
area not only creates a great number of accessible sites but influences
the diffusion of the ions in the electrolyte. By using the Randles–Sevcik
equation, the electrochemical active surface area (EASA) can be estimated
from cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (see EASA Measurement in the Supporting Information) by using the three-electrode
system.37 In Figure S18A, the CV plots of the CFC and samples 7 and 8 are displayed.
By fixing the electrode area to 1.0 cm2, their EASAs are
derived from the responses of Ip (voltammetry
peak current) versus ν1/2 (square root of sweep rate)
and plotted in Figure S18B. As a result,
the EASAs of the CFC and samples 7 and 8 are calculated to be 5.84,
12.1, and 16.5 cm2, respectively. Clearly, the EASA of
sample 8 is nearly 3 times as large as that of the original CFC. Thus,
sample 8 is selected to be the CNC-based electrode for further investigations.
The serial resistances Rs of the CFC and
the CNC-based electrode are characterized to be 1.4 × 102 and 3.7 Ω, respectively, by electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) (see Figure S19 and EIS Results in the Supporting Information). After the growth of
CNCs on the CFC, Rs lowers significantly.
Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curves of the CFC and the CNC-based
electrode are measured and displayed in Figure S22 in the Supporting Information. From the data, their
capacitances are estimated to be 0.542 and 107 F/g, for the CFC and
the CNC-based electrodes, respectively. The capacitance contribution
from the substrate is negligible. Obviously, the CNC-based electrode
is a potential candidate for SC devices.

2.4 Electrochemical
Tests of the Liquid-State
CNC-Based SC
The CNC-based electrodes were assembled into
a symmetric capacitor by employing the two-electrode system with H2SO4(aq) (1.0 M) as the electrolyte. The results
of the electrochemical tests are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3A presents the CV profiles of the CNC-based device
at various scan rates. The approximately rectangular-shaped CV loops
suggest that it is capacitive.10 It is
interesting that shapes of the loops maintain undeformed even at scan
rates as high as 80 mV/s and above. This indicates that the device
possesses a rapid charge transfer character. As presented in Figure 3B, the GCD curves
of the device display approximate triangle shapes in the potential
range (0.00–1.00 V). The specific capacitance (Csp) at 1.00 A/g is calculated to be 137 F/g.38 The value confirms that the device is supercapacitive.
On the basis of the approximate symmetric triangular shapes of the
charge/discharge profiles, the device is proposed to follow the electric
double-layer charge storage mechanism.39 It is worth noting that at 1.00 A/g, a slight IR drop (0.0166 V)
at 217.5 s indicates that the SC may possess a low internal resistance.
This property is the result of the high electrical conductivity and
ion diffusion ability of the device. Rs and the charge transfer resistance Rct of the CFC and the CNC-based SC devices are estimated to be 1.2
× 102 and 7.5 × 102 Ω as well
as 6.5 and 4.9 Ω, respectively, by EIS (see Figures S20, S21A,
Table S2, and EIS Results in the Supporting Information).40,41 Clearly, because of the growth of CNCs on
the CNC-based SC, both Rs and Rct decrease considerably so that the performance
is enhanced. The improvements are attributed to the increased electrical
conductivity and interfacial areas for better charge transfer between
the crisscrossing 1D CNC network and the deeply penetrated electrolyte.
The leakage resistance (RL) of the CNC-based
device is 526.0 Ω. The large difference between the double-layer
capacitance CDL (1.3 × 10–1 F) and the pseudocapacitance CL (3.3
× 10–4 F) suggests that the device is fundamentally
an EDLC. Figure 3C
depicts plots of the capacitance retention capability (C/C0) versus the scan rate (mV/s) and
the current density (A/g) of the SC. These exhibit a moderate performance
of this device. Figure 3D displays the result of the cycling tests (charging/discharging
at 10.00 A/g). After 5000 cycles, 85.6% of the original capacitance
is still retained. By comparing the first 10 cycles and the last 10
cycles shown in the inset of Figure 3D, we discover that the triangular-shaped profiles
are maintained. This indicates that the CNC-based SC retains a high
cycling stability.

2.5 Fabrication and Electrochemical Performance
of the Symmetric All-Carbon Solid-State CNC-Based SC
A solid-state
sandwich-type CNC-based symmetric electrode SC (2.5 × 1.0 cm2, 0.1965 g) with H2SO4/polyvinylalcohol
(PVA) gel as the electrolyte is shown in Figure S23A,B in the Supporting Information. The capacitive behaviors
of the device were examined by CV and GCD techniques within a potential
window (0.00–1.00 V). As shown in Figure 4A, the CV curves are recorded at different
scan rates (10–100 mV/s). At low scan rates, the CV loops display
approximate rectangular shapes. With increasing scan rates, the shapes
of the CV profiles alter slightly. In Figure 4B, the GCD profiles (1.00–10.00 A/g)
are displayed. As observed in the GCD curves, the profiles from the
high current density show triangular shapes, while the one measured
at the low current density (1.00 A/g) deviates significantly. As discussed
above, this is attributed to the long transporting distance for the
ions passing from the surface of the internal CNCs to the separator.
We speculate that due to the complicated interface between the gel
electrolyte and the CNCs, the electrolyte may not cover all CNC surface.
This would increase the internal resistance and cause the IR drops
observed in the GCD curves. The specific capacitance of the device
is determined from the CV profile integrations and the slopes of the
discharge curves (see Electrochemical Measurements in the Supporting Information). From the CV profile
integrations, the highest specific capacitance is calculated to be
143 F/g at 10 mV/s. On the basis of the slopes of the discharge curves,
the specific capacitance is determined to be 163 F/g at 1.00 A/g.
This value is close to the result reported for the liquid-state SC
device. Rs, Rct, and RL of the solid-state device are
derived to be 10.3, 41.5, and 6236.0 Ω, respectively, by EIS
(see Figure S21B, Table S2, and EIS Results in the Supporting Information). These are compared to the data of
the liquid-state SC device. While Rs does
not increase much, Rct is about 8 times,
and RL is about 12 times of the values
of the liquid-state one. We attribute the change to the less efficient
charge transfer at the interface between the gel and the electrode
surface. The high RL suggests that the
solid-state SC device is less prone to self-discharge than the liquid-state
one. On the other hand, the values of CDL (1.5 × 10–1 F) and CL (1.5 ×
10–4 F) are comparable to those of the liquid-state
device. Overall, the solid-state SC maintains much of the performance
of the liquid-state one. An ideal SC should possess not only high
specific capacitance but also high energy and power densities. Here,
this solid-state CNC-based SC displays an outstanding energy density
15.3 W h/kg and an excellent power density 510 W/kg. As shown in Table
S3 in the Supporting Information, literature
reports of the potential window, capacitance, energy density, and
power density of other carbon-based SCs are compared to our all-carbon
solid-state CNC-based SC. Clearly, the performance of our device is
among one of the best values. In Figure 4C, the capacitance retention capability (C/C0) versus the scan rate (mV/s)
and the current density (A/g) is plotted. Both types of measurements
suggest that the capacitance retention capabilities decrease as the
applied variables are increased. We speculate that these are the results
of the relatively thick device geometry. In terms of long-term cycling
stability, the CNC-based SC exhibits a superior cycling performance.
As presented in Figure 4D, the device is examined by a constant charge/discharge current
density of 5.00 A/g for 5000 cycles. After the cycling, it retains
80.2% of the initial capacitance due to the EDLC behavior.

capacitor. (A) CV profiles, (B) GCD curves, (C) capacitance retention
at various scan rates and current densities, and (D) long-term cycling
tests at 5.00 A/g and (insets) the first and the last 10 cycles.

The flexible device could be bended
extremely (Figure S23C). For practical
applications, the device needs
to be stable after deformation. As shown in Figure 5A, the CV curves are measured at various
bending angles (θ, 0°–150°). The CV loop at
150° does not show significant difference from the ones at the
other angles. The capacitance retentions (C/C0) vs the bending angles are plotted in Figure 5B. It is clear that
97.4% of the initial capacitance is still retained even at the high
θ 150° (see inset). It is interesting to see that at 60°,
the capacitance retention exceeds 100%. We speculate that the bending
action might squeeze the gel electrolyte into initially unoccupied
nanovoids among CNCs and cause the apparent increased value. To demonstrate
the possibility for potential applications, the CV profile (Figure 6) of a tandem device
of the CNC-based SCs in a serial connection (inset) is presented.
For this device, the CV profile indicates that its potential window
can be extended at least to 2.00 V. This suggests that by using the
tandem configuration, the SC could be employed to meet the requirements
for more applications.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
developed an Au/K bicatalyst-assisted CVD
process using C2H2(g) to grow uniform high-density
CNCs three-dimensionally on the fibers in the CFC substrate. The as-deposited
substrate shows high EASA, suggesting its potential usefulness as
the electrodes for electrochemical devices. The unique 1D helical
structure of the CNCs not only provides increased surface areas but
also shortens the diffusion pathways of the ions in the electrolyte.
In addition, the intercrossing of the CNCs also generates efficient
electron conduction routes. Thus, the electrode structure not only
boosts fast charge transfer but also promotes efficient electron conduction.
By employing the CNC-based electrodes, both liquid- and solid-state
SCs with excellent electrochemical properties, within a working potential
window 0.00–1.00 V, are fabricated. The liquid-state and the
solid-state devices demonstrate outstanding capacitances 137 and 163
F/g, respectively. In addition, the solid-state CNC-based SC exhibits
remarkable energy density (15.3 W h/kg) and power density (510 W/kg).
The device demonstrates superior flexibility at the bending angle
150° without sacrifice its performance. In summary, the ultralight
weight flexible solid-state CNC-based SC offers both high energy and
power densities. We envisage that such devices will be promising candidates
for eco-friendly wearable and flexible energy storage systems in the
future.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Growth
of CNCs
After several experimental
attempts (see Experimental Parameter Optimization and sample 8 in
Table S1 in the Supporting Information),
an optimized set of growth conditions were determined and described
below. To a cleaned CFC (6.5 cm × 6.5 cm, CeTech), a layer of
Au was uniformly deposited on both sides by e-gun PVD (Figure S1 in
the Supporting Information). The cloth
was further cut into rectangles 2.5 × 1.0 cm2 and
immersed into HAuCl4(aq) (1 wt %, Alfa Aesar 49.5%) for
10 min. The as-processed CF substrates were loaded on a specially
designed quartz device as shown in Figure S11 and placed in a hot-wall CVD reactor (Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). Under a flow of H2(g) (20 sccm), the HAuCl4 was reduced at 443 K
for 30 min to form Au NPs. After the reactor was purged by Ar(g) (100 sccm) for 15 min, the quartz device was pushed downstream
to 20 cm away from the center of the furnace. Then, KH powder (0.25
g, Sigma-Aldrich) was loaded on another quartz tube and placed at
the center of the furnace. The KH powder was thermally decomposed
at 623 K under Ar(g) flow (20 sccm, 1 atm) for 1 h to from
K(l). K(l) was evaporated at 2.0 × 10–3 Torr, 443 K, for 30 min to deposit K(l) uniformly inside and out of the CFC substrate at 373 K. After all
the K(l) was deposited, the quartz tube loader was removed
under Ar(g) (100 sccm). Then, the substrate was placed
at the center of the furnace and ramped under 1 atm of Ar(g) (20 sccm) to 723 K. C2H2(g) (11 sccm) and
H2(g) (10 sccm) were introduced to deposit carbon for 1
h. After the reaction was completed, the furnace was cooled down to
room temperature under 1 atm of Ar(g) (20 sccm). The substrate
turned brown (Figure S2) and was washed
by ethanol and DI water several times to remove potassium containing
byproducts. After being dried in an oven at 333 K, the CNC-based electrode
was obtained.

4.2 Instruments for Characterization
SEM images and EDS data of samples were obtained from a JEOL JSM-7401F
operated at 10 keV. TEM images, SAED patterns, and EDS data were acquired
on a JEOL JEM-ARM200FTH at 200 kV. XRD patterns were recorded by using
a Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE X-ray Diffractometer with Cu Kα 1 radiation.
Raman spectra were taken on a HORIBA Jobin Yvon HR800 UV confocal
micro-Raman spectrometer with a 632.8 nm He–Ne laser beam source.
TGA data were recorded with a Netzsch STA 409 PC Luxx.

4.3 Fabrication of Solid-State SCs
A
gel electrolyte was prepared by adding PVA powder (1.0 g, 88%, average Mw 88 000, Acros Organic) into H2SO4(aq) (10.0 mL, 1.0 M, J.T. Baker). The mixture was
vigorously stirred at 358 K, until a clear solution was obtained.
Two CNC-based electrodes (2.5 × 1.0 cm2) were immersed
into the solution for 10 min, so that the electrolyte may penetrate
effectively into the voids among the CNCs. A separator composed of
polypropylene was sandwiched between the electrodes. After this device
was dried at room temperature in air to solidify the gel electrolyte,
the CNC-based solid-state symmetric SC (0.1965 g) was obtained.

4.4 Electrochemical Measurements
CV profiles,
EIS data, and GCD curves were collected on a CHI 6081C electrochemical
workstation. Both three- and two-electrode systems were employed to
characterize performance of the electrodes. In a three-electrode system,
the electric properties of the as-fabricated CNC-based electrodes
were measured against a Pt wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference
electrode in H2SO4 (1.0 M). The solution-state
SC performance in H2SO4 (1.0 M) was examined
with a two-electrode system by using the CNC electrode for both electrodes.
The solid-state SC was characterized similarly.42 See more discussions in EASA Measurements, Electrochemical
