Nowadays, with the rapid development
of environmental protection
awareness, the demand for the emergence of a green counterpart of
lubricant additive plays a more and more important role in reducing
friction and wear as the times require. In this paper, full-hollow
and semihollow molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) microspheres
were prepared via a hydrothermal method and were characterized and
confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). According to our
results, both fully hollow and semihollow MoS2 microspheres
possessed excellent lubrication-enhancing effects for liquid paraffin
(LP), while full-hollow samples after friction provided better photocatalytic
degradation properties than semihollow samples after friction. Related
analysis indicated that curved layer opened structures with more rim
and edge sites, bigger surface area, and narrower band gap made full-hollow
MoS2 samples achieve a better photocatalytic level. Thus,
it was a sustainable solution for both lubrication-enhancing and photocatalytic
degradation functions during different stages of the usage of lubricating
oils, which suggests a potential strategy for achieving environmentally
friendly developments.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Friction is a common physical
phenomenon which consumes a great
deal of energy, and wear caused by friction is one major reason for
mechanical failures. It is estimated that about 1/3 of the energy
in the world is consumed by friction in various forms, and about 80%
of the machine component failures are generated from friction in different
ways. Improving lubrication, controlling friction and reducing wear
are important strategies to save energy and achieve high reliability.
For example, great efforts have been made, and many additives have
been introduced to lubricating oils to improve their lubrication performance.1−4 Nevertheless, they may also cause subsequent pollution, and developing
green lubrication systems with both better lubricating performances
and degradation properties is of great practical significance.

Due to the weak van der Waals force between layered structures,
MoS2 has been used as a solid lubricant and additive for
lubricating oil and/or solid materials as lubricants for many years.5−11 Related lubricating mechanisms, such as rolling, deformation, exfoliation,
and chemical stability, have been illustrated.12−14 Especially,
nanosized or microsized MoS2 with high surface areas also
show excellent photocatalytic activity in the photoinduced degradation
of organic pollutants.15−17 Compared to those layer-closed structures (such as
fullerene-like and hollow sphere-like structures), MoS2 with layer-opened structures can possess better photocatalytic performances
due to more active atoms located at rim and edge sites.18−21 The microscopic morphology of MoS2 plays a crucial role
in its macroscopic properties, which can be controlled or modulated
by the proper method.22−28 In this work, MoS2 with special microscopic structures
was prepared, which helps to achieve a sustainable solution combined
lubrication-enhancing and photocatalytic degradation promotion for
lubricating oil at different stages.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterizations of Samples
XRD
patterns of full-hollow MoS2 and semihollow MoS2 samples are presented in Figure 1a, and both of them contain four diffractive peaks
at 13.7°, 33.1°, 39.5°, and 58.9°, corresponding
to (002), (100), (103), and (110) crystal planes of MoS2, respectively. No other diffractive peaks corresponding to impurity
phases are detected. TEM and SEM images of the two samples (Figure 1b to Figure 1e) show that full-hollow and
semihollow microspheres with uniform size have been successfully prepared,
while the full-hollow sample possesses a slightly thicker shell.

MoS2.

The hydrothermal formation
process of full-hollow structure is
illustrated in Figure 2a. Bu4N+ ionized from Bu4NBr can
form small aggregates, and then vesicles are formed by increasing
aggregate size. Plenty of MoO42– in solution
can be absorbed to the vesicles by electrostatic interaction. With
temperature increasing, H2S generates from the decomposition
of KSCN, which can react with MoO42– and
form MoS2. For semihollow structure (Figure 2b), thiomolybdate precursor (Mo3(S2)6S)2– can be formed by
the reaction between Na2MoO4 and KSCN. Then
Bu4N+ can be absorbed to (Mo3(S2)6S)2– also by electrostatic
interaction, and MoO42– can be absorbed
to Bu4N+ similarly. Finally, H2S
reacts with MoO42– to form MoS2, and (Mo3(S2)6S)2– gradually decomposed into MoS2.

of the formation process of (a) hollow MoS2 microspheres
and (b) core–shell MoS2 microspheres.

2.2 Tribological Properties
Figure 3a and Figure 3b show that the average
friction
coefficient and the average wear scar diameter (AWSD) decrease rapidly
when MoS2 concentration is quite lower, which results from
MoS2 microspheres entering into the surface of friction
pairs along with LP, due to its spherical structures including rolling
and deformation.13 When the concentrations
of full-hollow and semihollow MoS2 are higher than 0.20%
and 0.30%, respectively, the friction coefficients for the two systems
increase in different ways. There are sufficient additives between
the surfaces of friction pairs, and varying degrees of exfoliations
are produced, as shown in Figure 4a to Figure 4c. Obviously, the resistance to friction pairs is stronger
when microspheres are exfoliated directly, so the average friction
coefficient rises as in Figure 3a and Figure 3b. In addition, AWSD can reach the smallest value because direct
exfoliation can lead to smaller contacting areas between friction
pairs. When the concentrations of full-hollow and semihollow MoS2 are higher than 0.30% and 0.50%, respectively, fewer microspheres
can enter the surface of friction pairs owing to agglomeration, which
results in lower average friction coefficient under the same lubrication
mechanism. As illustrated in the inset pictures at the top right corner
of Figure 3a and Figure 3b, the friction coefficient
of LP containing semihollow samples is relatively stable. TEM and
SEM images of samples after friction (Figure 4d–Figure 4g) indicate that they are destroyed in different
degrees by friction, and layer-closed structures have turned into
layer-opened structures. Plenty of curved layer-opened fragments appear,
thus friction makes samples obtain bigger surface area and more rim
and edge sites. For semihollow samples, only small amounts of them
are destroyed (Figure 4f and Figure 4g),
due to the good mechanical property of its core–shell structure.

2.3 Photocatalytic Degradation
Figure 5 gives the photocatalytic
degradation behaviors generated by full-hollow MoS2 before
friction (FB), full-hollow MoS2 after friction (FA), semihollow
MoS2 before friction (SB), and semihollow MoS2 after friction (SA) in the photocatalytic tests. Figure 5a indicates that c/c0 (c0:
initial concentration of LP, c: real-time concentration of LP in photocatalytic
degradation) has a positive correlation with MoS2 concentration.
The optimum concentration for FB and FA is 0.40 wt %, while the optimum
concentration for SB and SA is 0.60 wt %. In photocatalytic tests,
the full-hollow sample can obtain same photocatalytic effects (corresponding
to the same contact areas) by rather smaller amounts than semihollow
sample or other solid materials. Supposing that the shell size of
semihollow and full-hollow samples is the same, the contact area between
semihollow morphology and LP is Ss, and
the contact area between full-hollow morphology and LP is Sf: 1  The average mass of a single full-hollow
sphere
and semihollow sphere (mf and ms) can be expressed as 2   3  where Vf or Vs are the average volume of a full-hollow sphere
or a semihollow sphere, and ρ is the average density of samples.

changing tendency of the average degradation rate of LP
with the increase of MoS2 microsphere concentration (from
0 to 0.7 wt %). Inset at top right corner and bottom right corner:
the absorbance of LP after photocatalytic tests at different concentration
of FA and SA. (b) Geometric analysis of semihollow samples and full-hollow
samples.

Figure 5a also indicates
that the incensement of MoS2 concentration leads to the
abatement of light transmittance of the LP mixture, so that c/c0 gradually decreases with
increasing MoS2 concentration. FA has better photocatalytic
properties than SA since there are more curved fragments in the former
one. As shown in Figure 4c to Figure 4f, hollow
structures are destroyed more seriously by friction, and many curved
nanoplatelets or nanosheets form sequentially. In this way, there
are larger contact areas between MoS2 and LP, and more
active rim-edge atoms with dangling bonds in nanoplatelets and nanosheets
can result in higher catalytic activity.18−21

Although FA possesses a
higher catalytic activity, its photoinduced
degradation rate for LP is only about 15.0%, which can be improved
by other means. It is shown in Figure 6 that the photocatalytic degradation rate induced by
FA can be greatly improved in acid solution (reaches ∼50% at
pH = 3). On the contrary, alkaline environment can lead to a decrease
in degradation rate. The hydroxyl radical (•OH) plays an important
role in degradation of organic compound due to its strong oxidizability,
which is partly determined by pH value. At pH = 3, the oxidation potential
of •OH ranges from 2.65 to 2.80 V, and its oxidizing property
is next only to fluorine in nature; the value is only 1.9 V when pH
value reaches 7.30,31 Obviously, the oxidizability
of •OH is much stronger in acid environment than that in neutral
environment. Proton can reduce the concentration of •OH when
pH values are smaller than 3, as parts of •OH have been converted
into OH–, resulting in a decrease of LP degradation.32 On the other hand, when the pH value is higher
than 7, the hydroxyl radical is rapidly converted into •O–: 4  •O– works more slowly
than •OH, so that the photocatalytic efficiency is greatly
reduced.33 By adjusting pH values, the
degradation efficiency can be greatly enhanced from 15.0% to 45.0%.

Figure 6 Influence
of pH value on photocatalytic efficiency of FA. Inset
at top left corner and top right corner: the absorbance of LP after
photocatalytic tests in acid solution and alkaline solution.

In order to confirm the effect
of pH value on the concentration
of •OH, a kinetic modeling of •OH is suggested and discussed.
Considering the photocatalytic reaction process, •OH is produced
by O2 and H2O: 5  LP degradation by hydroxyl radicals is expressed
as 6  Thus, the
degradation rate of LP can be written
as 7  However,
there are some hydroxyl radical scavengers
(X) in the reaction system, and the effect of X can be written as 8  Then, according to eqs 5, 6, and 8, the changing rate of hydroxyl radical concentration can
be expressed as 9  

Generally, pseudo steady state
is assumed with regard to reactants,
so that the concentration of hydroxyl radicals can be considered as
constant at a certain time, thus: 10  Combining eqs 9 and 10: 11  Substituting eqs 11 into 7: 12  In the experiments, the
amount of LP is relatively
small, and it can be regarded as effective degradation, thus: 13  

Combining eqs 12 and 13, eq 12 can be changed as 14  or 15  where kap = , and kap is
the pseudo-first-order rate constant and depends on the concentration
of •OH.

kap can be calculated
by the slope
of kinetic fit (Figure 7), and it also represents the reaction rate affected by •OH.
pH value has great influence on kap, which
indicates that it also has a great influence on the concentration
of •OH. When pH value is 3, kap reaches the maximum value, which is the best parameter for photocatalytic
degradation.

at different
pH values. Inset: the changing tendency of kab at different pH values.

On the other hand, dye absorbed on the surface of MoS2 is stimulated to the excited state (dye*) by absorbing visible
light.
The excited photoelectrons transfer to the conduction band of MoS2 from dye* and resulted in the conversion of dye to the radical
cation •dye+.34 O2 absorbed on the surface of MoS2 can be reduced
to superoxide radicals (•O2–),
which have the ability of degrading an organic compound (LP and •dye+) to small molecules by photoelectrons on the conduction band.
In our experiment, only 0.9 wt ‰ of methyl orange (MO: a kind
of dye) is added into the LP mixture (pH = 3). Figure 8 indicates that MO can significantly improve
the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation for LP (to about 68.0%).
What is particularly worth mentioning is that MO can be almost completely
degraded after 8 h. Therefore, there is no new pollutant appearing
at the end of the photocatalytic degradation reaction.

Figure 8 Influence of MO on photocatalytic
efficiency for LP. Inset at top
left corner and top right corner: the absorbance of LP and MO after
photocatalytic tests of different hours at pH = 3.

The catalytic activity maintenance of FA after
several usage cycles
is also important. Figure 9 gives circular tests of photocatalytic degradation of LP
catalyzed by FA. Results indicate that the value of c/c0 does not increase obviously after
four cycles (lasting 48 h, pH = 3, without MO), indicating its excellent
recyclable property and stability in photocatalytic degradation. However,
the degradation rate is only 48.6% after four cycles when MO is involved
(lasting 48 h, pH = 3), probably because some degradation products
of MO are adsorbed on the surface of MoS2.

Figure 9 Reusability tests for
degradation of LP by FA at pH value of 3
with and without MO.

The light absorption properties of FB, FA, SB, and SA have
been
investigated by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) (Figure 10), and the reflection
pathway of light on the surface of these MoS2 microspheres
with different morphologies is schematically illustrated in the inset
at the top right corner of Figure 10. Semihollow MoS2 microspheres exhibit stronger
photoabsorption behavior almost in the whole detected wavelength range
because semihollow structure allows more multiple reflections of light
within the interior cavity, corresponding to more efficient use of
the light source.

left corner:
the estimated band-gap energy of FB and FA. Inset at top right corner:
a schematic light pathway illustration of MoS2 microspheres
with different morphologies.

However, FA has the best photocatalytic property because
of so
many curved nanoplatelets and nanosheets with active rim-edge atoms,
which indicates active rim-edge atoms are more important than light
absorption properties. Better light absorption performance can improve
the charge separation. The estimated band gap values of MoS2 before and after friction are 2.02 and 2.33 eV, respectively, as
shown in the inset at the top left corner of Figure 10. The narrower band gap of friction-induced
samples indicates that more photogenerated charges are separated,
which can enhance the photocatalytic performance.

Investigations
on other important factors for photocatalytic properties
(Figure 11) indicate
that water and light are determining factors in photocatalysis, which
can be confirmed by contrasting experimental results of photocatalysis
by adding light or deionized water. In addition, triethanolamine (TEOA), tert-butanol (t-Bu), and N2 as
photohole (h+) scavenger, radical scavenger, and O2 scavenger, respectively, are also involved in examining the
effects of these scavengers on photocatalysis (pH = 3). As shown in Figure 11, TEOA can reduce
the photocatalytic activity to a certain value, which means photoholes
(h+) play a major role in photocatalysis. Photoholes (h+) with positive charge have a strong oxidizability, and water
(H2O) and hydroxyl (OH–) can be oxidized
and generate plenty of hydroxyl radicals (•OH). On the other
hand, some other organic materials absorbed on the surface of the
photocatalyst can also be oxidized by photoholes (h+) effortlessly.
In addition, N2 and t-Bu also have some
negative influence on photocatalysis.

Figure 11 Effects of various factors
on photocatalytic properties of FA.

3.4 Suggested Mechanism for Photocatalytic Degradation
A possible mechanism is proposed to explain the high photocatalytic
degradation efficiency of FA under visible-light irradiation. As shown
in Figure 12a, full-hollow
MoS2 microspheres will be destroyed by friction. Plenty
of curved nanoplatelets and nanosheets are generated subsequently,
and curved structure allows multiple reflections of light, resulting
in more efficient use of the light source. In addition, a layer-opened
structure has more rim and edge sites produced by friction (Figure 12b), which are more
active than basal surfaces. Bigger surface area and narrower bandgap
of FA also lead to better photocatalytic properties. In Figure 12c, when FA is irradiated
by a high-pressure mercury lamp, photoelectrons (e–) jump from the valence band to conduction band, and therefore photoholes
(h+) are formed in the valence band. Moreover, the dye
absorbed on the surface of MoS2 is stimulated to the excited
state (dye*) by absorbing visible light, and then excited photoelectrons
transfer to the conduction band of MoS2 from dye*. As photoelectrons
(e–) have high reductive ability and can be easily
captured by O2, they eventually generate plenty of •OH.
Water or other organic materials absorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst
can be oxidized effortlessly by oxidizing photoholes (h+), and •OH can also be generated by the reactions of h+ and H2O or OH–.29 All the radicals can degrade most organic compounds to
CO2 and H2O or other molecules.

irradiation.

3 Conclusions
The tribological performances and photocatalytic degradation effect
of full-hollow and semihollow MoS2 microspheres on paraffin
have been investigated. Both of them can exhibit good tribological
behaviors, while full-hollow samples possess better photocatalytic
efficiency. Full-hollow structure destroyed seriously by friction
can result in many curved layer-opened fragments, and more rims and
edges can perform more efficient photocatalytic reactions. Furthermore,
our results also showed that acid solution can enhance photocatalytic
efficiency greatly, which can be illustrated by a kinetic model. In
a word, a green and sustainable strategy for the design of combining
both lubricating additive and photocatalyst at different stages of
LP mixtures has been suggested, which is just a preliminary attempt
to move along the great idea of full-life-cycle green design of a
lubricating oil system.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Potassium thiocyanate (KSCN)
and TEOA were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.,
and sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4) was provided
by Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.. Tetrabutyl ammonium bromide
(Bu4NBr) and t-Bu were bought from Shanghai
Lingfeng chemical reagent Co., Ltd., and MO, LP, absolute alcohol,
and other common chemicals were commercially available and used without
further purification.

4.2 Techniques
XRD
was carried out by
a Rigaku K/max-γA X-ray diffractometer. SEM images were obtained
on a FEI Inspect F50 instrument, and TEM images were obtained by a
JEM-2100 instrument. UV–vis absorption spectra and UV–vis
DRS were carried on a UV-3600 spectrometer and a UV-2600 spectrometer,
respectively. The tribological properties were explored by a MRS-10A
four-ball testing machine under the condition of a constant load of
280 ± 4 N and a rotational speed of 1450 rpm at 75 ± 2 °C.
Photocatalytic degradation tests were carried out on a photochemical
reaction instrument (JT-GHX-AC, Hangzhou, China).

4.3 Preparation of MoS2 Samples
Full-Hollow MoS2 Microspheres
Amounts of
0.67 g of KSCN and 0.56 g of Na2MoO4 were dissolved
in 65 mL of deionized water by magnetic stirring, and 0.23 g of Bu4NBr was added into the obtained solution. Then the pH value
of the above solution was adjusted to ∼1. The solution was
transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated
at 240 °C for 24 h. The obtained black precipitates were washed
by deionized water and absolute ethanol and dried in vacuum at 60
°C for 20 h.

Semihollow MoS2 Microspheres
The preparation
was the same as that for full-hollow MoS2, except that
the pH value was controlled around 5.

4.4 Tribological
Tests
Full-hollow and
semihollow MoS2 microspheres were used as lubricating additives
for LP. The steel balls used in MRS-10A four-ball testing machine
were made from GCr15 materials with hardness of 61–64 HRC and
the roughness of Ra = 0.02 μm. The wear rate was determined
by the AWSD (±0.01 mm) of the three bottom balls.

4.5 Photocatalytic Degradation Test
Certain
amounts of reclaimed MoS2 powders after friction tests
were added in a mixture of 1.0 g of LP and 1.5 g of deionized water
by ultrasonic dispersion for 40 min in the dark. Each system was put
into a photochemical reaction instrument under continuous stirring
and irradiated by a high-pressure mercury lamp. After photocatalytic
reaction, MoS2 was removed by centrifugation, and 10.0
g of dichloromethane was added in each solution. The mixtures were
separated by a separating funnel. The concentration of LP was determined
by a UV–vis spectrometer and repeated three times.
