Neurotransmitters
are the key factors in ameliorating the symptoms
of nervous system diseases. Stroke/cerebral ischemia has been proven
to be caused by the excess release of excitatory amino acid glutamate
in the brain, and the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric
acid (GABA) is considered to be the best choice to counteract the
action of glutamate. Here, we show that GABA
conjugated to a cytoplasmic transduction peptide (YGRRARRRRRR) by
means of custom chemical synthesis could penetrate through the blood–brain
barrier, increasing the GABA level in the plasma of rats and mice,
which, as a result, display a state of calmness and somnolence.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Stroke/cerebral ischemia
remains the second leading cause of death
and of lasting adult disability.1 The occurrence
of stroke-induced cell death in the brain is ascribed to the excess
release of excitatory glutamate, and as a compensatory effect, the
inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is released.
However, the release of GABA occurs rather slowly in vivo, that is,
3 days after the stroke, and thus only affords a mild improvement
in functional recovery.2 Thus, administration of exogenic GABA is supposed to be the best choice
in clinical use.

Quite a few of attempts have been made to find pharmacological
therapies of GABA to treat stroke, but several of these experiments
have failed because, as expected, neurotransmitters, including GABA,
cannot pass freely across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) in
vivo. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been receiving much attention
in recent decades as a tool for delivering various materials with
low membrane permeability into the cell.3 They have been used in many research fields, including drug-delivery
systems and regenerative medicine. We have also studied up on our
works of TAT (YGRKKRRQRRR, one of the CPPs) carrying proteins through
BBB in treatment of various kinds of nervous diseases, such as TAT-ChAT,4 TAT-TH,5 TAT-BDNF,6 TAT-CNTF,7 TAT-GH,8 etc. CPP conjugates with these enzymes or bioactive
factors could efficiently cross the BBB and penetrate into the brain,
consequently demonstrating their therapeutic effects. It clearly showed
that the CPP conjugates had already carried the exogenic neuroactive
agents across BBB.

Cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP) is
an interesting CPP. It
can permeate across the cell membrane, entering into the cytoplasm
of the cell but not into the nucleus.9 Thus,
if the conjugate used is not expected to enter the nucleus of the
cell, the CTP moiety will be more desirable than the other CPPs to
avoid side effects, if any. The permeation efficiency of CPP across
the cell membrane is not influenced by whether it is conjugated to
the N- or C-terminal.10−13 Here, we show that a membrane-permeable conjugate with the CPP connected
to the C-terminus of GABA is also able to answer the purpose.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Pharmacokinetic Study of
GABA in Rats
First, we used rats in the experiments to make intravenous gutta easy. Six male rats (Sprague-Dawley species) were stratified
into control and GABA groups by weight and assigned randomly. GABA
was administered by intravenous gutta (50 mg/kg h) via the tail vein.
The GABA levels in the plasma and brain samples were detected by liquid
chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC–MS) analysis.

The
results showed that the plasma concentrations of GABA in the rats in which GABA was administered
by intravenous gutta (50 mg/kg h) was obviously elevated within 1
h and approached a plateau of 4461 ng/mL in a dynamic equilibrium
state. However, no free GABA could be detected in the plasma of the
control rats, in which saline was administered by intravenous gutta
over a period of 1 h (Figure 1a and Table 1).

Figure 1 LC–MS analysis of free GABA in the plasma supernatants of
rats and mice. (a) GABA (50 mg/kg h) and saline were separately administered
to anesthetized rats by intravenous gutta; blood from the rats was
withdrawn at various time intervals, and the plasma samples were subjected
to LC–MS analysis. The GABA concentration in the plasma of
rats administered GABA by intravenous gutta elevated
within 1 h and approached 4461 ng/mL in a dynamic equilibrium state;
however, no free GABA could be detected in the plasma of the control
rats. (b) The GABA concentration in the plasma of mice after one bolus
intravenous injection of GABA–CPP rose up to 7985 ng/mL within
2 min and then sharply decreased to 141 ng/mL within 1 h, whereas
the GABA levels in the plasma of mice injected with GABA remained
at a very low level (10–24 ng/mL) over a period of 1 h after
one bolus intravenous injection in mice.

Table 1 GABA Concentrations in Plasma and
Brain Tissue of Intravenous Dripping Rats in the Dynamic Equilibrium State (n = 3)
 	plasma (ng/mL)	brain (ng/mL)	
saline dripping rats	0	247.3 ± 69.5	
GABA dripping rats	4461 ± 3589	271.8 ± 15.2	
The GABA concentration in the brain supernatants of
rats administered
GABA by intravenous gutta (271.8 ± 15.2 ng/mL) seems slightly
higher than that in saline control rats (247.3 ± 69.5 ng/mL),
but there is no statistical significance (Table 1). However, the result might not necessarily mean that
GABA cannot penetrate into the brain because during slow intravenous
gutta, the speed of GABA penetration into the brain tissue is in dynamic
equilibrium with the clearance rate of GABA from the brain.

2.2 GABA–CTP BBB Penetration Experiment
Second,
nine male mice were divided into three groups (control
group, GABA group, and GABA–CTP group) by weight and assigned
randomly. GABA (50 mg/kg) and the GABA–CPP conjugate (GABA–YGRRARRRRRR,
10 mg/kg) were each administrated via the tail vein in one bolus,
and in control mice, saline was used instead. The plasma and brain
samples were collected for detection of the GABA content by the LC–MS
assay.

The GABA concentrations in the blood stream of the saline
control mice were negligible (data not shown), whereas the GABA concentrations
in the plasma of the mice intravenously injected GABA rose up to 7985
ng/mL within 2 min and then sharply decreased to 141 ng/mL within
1 h (Figure 1b). However,
the GABA concentration in the plasma of mice injected with GABA–CPP
remained at a very low level (10–24 ng/mL) over a period of
1 h after intravenous injection (Figure 1b).

The GABA concentration in the brain supernatants
of the mice was then examined. This showed that GABA at dose of 50
mg/kg essentially penetrated, as expected, into the brain tissue (474
± 33 μg/g) and so did GABA–CPP (446 ± 44 μg/g)
at a dose of 10 mg/kg (Table 2).

3 Conclusions
Comprehensive analysis of the above-mentioned data clearly shows
that GABA and GABA–CPP are able to cross the BBB and penetrate
into the brain cells; however, the GABA–CPP conjugate showed
a much higher permeation speed than that of GABA per se. The mice
injected with GABA–CPP at a dose of 10 mg/kg showed a GABA
concentration in the brain tissues approximately equal to that in
the mice injected with only GABA at a dose of 50 mg/kg. That is, GABA–CPP
injected at one-fifth of the weight dosage (corresponding to 1/80
the molar dosage) of GABA resulted at approximately the same concentration
of GABA in the brain tissue. The penetration efficacy of GABA–CPP
into the brain in vivo is much higher than that of GABA alone.

The behavior of the mice after injection of GABA or GABA–CPP
seemed more or less alike, but in varying degrees. All of the mice
injected with GABA (50 mg/kg) or GABA–CPP (10 mg/kg) showed
quiet and sleepy behavior, but the symptom of the mice injected GABA−CPP
appeared a bit worse.

In summary, the brain bioavailability
of the GABA–CPP conjugate
is much higher than that of GABA per se. The undecapeptide CPP is
a potential carrier of GABA across the BBB.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Reagents
The synthetic peptides CTP
(YGRRARRRRRR) and GABA–CTP were synthetized by SBS Genetech
Co., Ltd. in a purity of 98%. The molecular weights of the peptides
were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The lyophilized peptides were
prepared and diluted in 0.9% NaCl before use.

GABA was purchased
from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), with purity ≥99%.

LC–MS hypergrade acetonitrile was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt,
Germany). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade formic
acid was purchased from Dikma Technologies Inc. (Lake Forest, CA).
HPLC-grade ammonium formate was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical
reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). All other chemicals and reagents
of reagent grade were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Ultrapure water was prepared using a Milli-Q purification system (Millipore,
Bedford, MA).

4.2 Instrumentation and Conditions
An
Agilent 1290 Infinity HPLC system coupled with an Agilent 6410 B triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA)
was employed for the analysis.

Chromatographic separation was
achieved on an Thermo Scientific Syncronis HILIC HPLC column (2.1
mm × 100 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size) at 30 °C. The
flow rate was set at 0.4 mL/min. A gradient elution program was run
for chromatographic separation, with mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid,
5 mM ammonium formate in water) and mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid
in acetonitrile), as follows: the gradient elution method was used
with 75% solvent B, 75–60% over 0–1.2 min, 60–50%
over 1.2–2.5 min, 50–75% over 2.5–2.8 min, followed
by a re-equilibration time of 2.4 min. The total run time was 5.2
min for each sample.

The optimized ion source conditions were
as follows: transfer capillary
temperature, 320 °C; capillary voltage, 4000 V; nebulizer, 20
psi; and gas flow, 10 L/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in
the electrospray ionization (ESI)-positive ion selected reaction monitoring
mode using a dwell time of 50 ms per transition to detect ion pairs
at m/z 104.01–87 for GABA.
The fragmentor was 62 V and collision energy was 8 eV.

Data
were acquired and analyzed using the software Gastroplus V9.0
(Simulations Plus).

4.3 Calibration Standards and
Quality-Control
(QC) Samples
The stock solution of GABA was prepared by dissolving
the compound in 0.9% NaCl at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Working
solutions for calibration and control were prepared from the stock
solution by dilution with normal saline. All of the solutions were
stored at 4 °C and brought to room temperature before use.

GABA calibration standards were prepared by spiking blank rat plasma
or the brain homogenate with appropriate amounts of the working solutions.
Calibration plots were constructed in the range of 20–5000
ng/mL for GABA in rat plasma or the brain homogenate (20, 100, 500,
1000, and 5000 ng/mL). QC samples (100, 500, 1000, and 5000 ng/mL)
were prepared in a similar manner to that of the calibration standards.
The calibration standards and QC samples were stored at −20
°C.

4.4 Sample Preparation
An aliquot of
20 μL of plasma was diluted to 50 μL with normal saline
and precipitated by adding 100 μL of acetonitrile. After centrifugation
at 13 000 rpm for 15 min, a 5 μL aliquot of the supernatant
was injected into the liquid chromatography–ESI-mass spectrometry
(LC–ESI-MS) system. The brain sample was prepared (1:9, w/v)
and diluted 1:100 with normal saline. An aliquot of 50 μL of
the brain homogenate was precipitated by adding 100 μL of acetonitrile.
After centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 15 min, 5 μL aliquot
of the supernatant was injected into the LC–ESI-MS for analysis.

4.5 Animals
Rats (male, Sprague-Dawley
species, 180–220 g) and mice (male, 18–26 g, Kunming
species) were provided by the Experimental Animal Center of Academy
of Military Medical Sciences, China. The health condition of the mice
was examined to confirm their suitability for use in the study. The
animal rooms were monitored and maintained under a 12 h light–dark
cycle, with the temperature ranging from 20 to 25 °C and a relative
humidity of 40–60%. All of the mice were allowed to acclimate
to the laboratory environment for 2 days, provided with a standard
commercial diet and drinking water ad libitum. All of the animal procedures
performed in this study were reviewed and approved by the Animal Experimental
Welfare and Ethical Inspection Committee of the Chinese Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (Approval number IACUC#15-026).

4.6 Pharmacokinetic Study
The rats were
intraperitoneally anaesthetized with 10% chloral; then, GABA (Sigma)
was administrated by intravenous gutta (50 mg/kg h) via the tail vein.
The blood samples were taken from the plexuses oculus venosus at 5,
10, 20, 40, and 60 min intervals. The separated plasma was diluted
to 40% with saline and precipitated by acetonitrile. The supernatant
was collected by high-speed centrifugation. Then, the rats were killed
by blood-letting from the femoral artery. The brains were dissected,
homogenized in saline (1:9 w/v), diluted 100-fold, and precipitated
by acetonitrile; the supernatants were obtained by high-speed centrifugation.
Finally, both supernatant samples were subjected to LC–MS analyses
for detection of the free GABA content.

4.7 GABA–CTP
BBB Penetration Experiment
GABA (50 mg/kg) and GABA–CPP
conjugate (GABA–YGRRARRRRRR,
10 mg/kg), respectively, were injected via the tail vein in one bolus
into the mice. The same volume of normal saline was injected into
the control mice in the same manner. Samples were taken at 2, 5, 15,
30, and 60 min intervals after injection, and the concentrations of
GABA in the supernatants of blood and brain tissue were examined as
mentioned above.

4.8 Statistical Analysis
Descriptive
statistics were expressed as mean ± SD. The GABA concentrations
in plasma or brain homogenates of rats and mice were compared by analysis
of variance using SPSS software (version 20.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL). All tests of hypotheses were two-sided, and p values less than 0.05 and 0.01 were considered statistically significant.
