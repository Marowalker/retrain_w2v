The pyrazole scaffold is one of the
most prevalent and important
tool in medicinal chemistry. Here, we report a method for preparing
3,5-diarylpyrazoles in good to excellent yield by reacting hydrazones
of aryl aldehydes with substituted acetophenones in ethanol in the
presence of dimethyl sulfoxide/cat. I2/cat. HCl. The reverse
process, reacting hydrazones of substituted acetophenones with aryl
aldehydes under the same conditions, also provides 3,5-diarylpyrazoles
in good to excellent yields. Reaction of hydrazones of aldehydes with
2′-aryloxy ketones in the presence of cat. HCl in ethanol and
the catalyst-free reaction of phenacyl bromides with hydrazones of
aldehydes in ethanol also gave good to excellent yields of 3,5-diarylpyrazoles.

Introduction
The pyrazole scaffold
is one of the most prevalent and important
scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Many pyrazoles have been shown to
exhibit a wide range of biological activities such as antimicrobial,
anticonvulsant, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral, and anticancer
activity, to name just a few.1 Several
pyrazole-containing compounds are commercial drugs such as sildenafil
and celecoxib.1 Pyrazoles have been also
used as ligands for transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.2

Among the many pyrazoles that exhibit biological
activity are 3,5-diarylpyrazoles.1 Various
procedures have been developed to prepare
these compounds.1,3 However, many of these procedures
use expensive or hazardous transition-metal catalysts4 or undesirable solvents,4 or
stoichiometric or excess amounts of harsh or hazardous reagents (LiHMDS, tBuOLi, tBuOK, n-BuLi),5 or require the preparation of substituted chalcones,6 or specialized reagents,7 or the preparation or formation of potentially dangerous diazo or
azido substrates or intermediates.8 Here,
we report that 3,5-diarylpyrazoles can be prepared in good yield by
reacting substituted acetophenones or aryl aldehydes with the hydrazones
of aromatic aldehydes or acetophenones in the presence of catalytic
amounts of I2 and/or acid and a modest excess of dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) in ethanol.

Results and Discussion
We initiated
our studies by determining whether 3,5-diarylpyrazoles
could be formed by reacting substituted 2′-bromoacetophenones
with aryl hydrazones using 2′-bromoacetophenone (1) benzalhydrazone (2) as model substrates. We anticipated
that if the reaction between 1 and 2 occurred
preferentially at the carbonyl of 1, then the resulting
intermediate I would undergo further reaction (vide infra)
to produce the desired 3,5-diarylpyrazole 3 (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Formation of Pyrazole 3 via Intermediate I
A mixture of 1 equiv of 1 and 1.2 equiv of 2 in EtOH was stirred at room temperature for 5 min and then
refluxed.
The starting bromoacetophenone is completely consumed after 15–25
min as judged by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). After 30 min reflux,
the mixture was subjected to workup and chromatography, which provided
pyrazole 3 in a 30% yield (Table 1, entry 1). Longer reaction times did not
give better yields. The structure of 3 was confirmed
by X-ray crystallography (see the Supporting Information). Increasing the number of equiv of 2 to 1.4 or 2.2
gave only modest increases in yield (Table 1, entries 2 and 3). However, when 1.4 equiv
of 2 was added to a solution of 1 in the
refluxing ethanol and the reflux continued for 0.5 h, the yield of 3 increased to 92% (Table 1, entry 4). Reducing the equiv of 2 to
1.2 equiv resulted in a decrease in the yield (Table 1, entry 5). Applying these conditions using
4′-methoxy-2-bromoacetophenone (4) produced pyrazole 5 in 86% yield (Table 1, entry 6). 2-Phenoxyacetophenone (5) failed
to undergo reaction with hydrazone 2 to give pyrazole 3 under these conditions (Table 1, entry 7).

Benzal hydrazone
can potentially attack phenacyl bromides at the
carbonyl carbon to give intermediate I (pathway a, Scheme 2) or at the α-position
to give intermediate IV (pathway b, Scheme 2). Busch et al. reported that the reaction
of bromoacetophenone with excess hydrazine hydrate in ethanol at −5
°C occurs at the α-position to give 2-hydrazinyl-1-phenylethan-1-one
in 60% yield.9 However, pathway b does
not occur under our conditions as this route would produce 3,4-disubstituted
pyrazoles that were not isolated from the reactions. We propose two
possible pathways, c and d, for 3,5-diarylpyrazole formation. In pathway
c, intermediate I tautomerizes/aromatizes to intermediate II, which
then cyclizes to give intermediate III. Elimination of HBr from intermediate
III gives the 3,5-disubstituted pyrazoles. In pathway d, intermediate
I loses Br– to form resonance stabilized cation
V, which can cyclize to give intermediate VI. Deprotonation of VI
gives intermediate VII, which upon tautomerization/aromatization yields
the 3,5-disubstituted pyrazoles.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanisms for the Formation
of 3,5-Disubstituted Pyrazoles
from Phenacyl Bromides and Benzal Hydrazone
To make the procedure more broadly applicable, we decided
to use
ketones instead of phenacyl bromides and generate the haloketone in
situ using iodine. Refluxing a mixture of 2.0 equiv 2, 1.0 equiv of acetophenone, and 1.0 equiv of iodine in ethanol at
a reflux for 1.5 h afforded 3 in 80% yield (Table 2, entry 1). Decreasing
the number of equivalents of benzalhydrazone to 1.5 or 1.2 resulted
in a decrease in yield (Table 2, entries 2 and 3). Decreasing the amount of iodine to 0.1
equiv resulted in only a trace amount of 3 (Table 2, entry 4).

While this work was in progress, Aegurla and Peddinti reported
the synthesis of 3,5-diarylpyrazoles using a process very similar
to that described above wherein aryl hydrazones, generated in situ,
were reacted with substituted acetophenones in the presence of 1 equiv
of I2 in EtOH at 70 °C for 12 h.10 They also showed that the reaction of α-iodoacetophenone
with aryl hydrazones in refluxing EtOH at 70 °C provided 3,5-diarylpyrazoles.
They proposed that both reactions proceeded via an intermediate similar
to I (Schemes 1 and 2, I in place of Br) and
pathway d, though, in our opinion, pathway c is also possible.

Inspired by the successful synthesis of 3 from phenacyl
halides and aryl hydrazones (possibly via route c, Scheme 2), we investigated whether
pyrazole 3 could be prepared via the route outlined in Scheme 3. We reasoned that
the reaction of acetophenone (7) with hydrazone 2 may result in the reversible formation of pyrazoline intermediate
X via intermediates VIII and IX, which, in the presence of an oxidant,
would be irreversibly oxidized to pyrazole 3.

Scheme 3 Proposed
Alternative Route to Pyrazole 3
As DMSO/I2 is a well-known green catalyst for
iodine-mediated
oxidations,11,12 including the oxidation of pyrazolines
to pyrazoles,13 we first explored the route
outlined in Scheme 3 using these reagents. However, performing the reaction using 0.1
equiv I2 and 3.0 equiv DMSO resulted in only trace amounts
of the desired product after 24 h reflux and much of the starting
materials remained unconsumed (Table 2, entry 5). Therefore, this reaction was repeated except
a cat. amount of HCl was added, which we anticipated would promote
the formation of imine VIII and cyclization of intermediate IX. Under
these conditions, pyrazole 3 was obtained in an 85% yield
after 5 h reflux (Table 2, entry 6). Decreasing the amount of iodine to 0.05 equiv or increasing
the amount of DMSO to 4.0 equiv resulted respectively in increasing
or decreasing of the reaction time (Table 2, entries 7–9). As DMSO/HCl is also
a known oxidant,14 we attempted the reaction
in the absence of I2 but with a cat. amount of HCl. Under
these conditions, pyrazole 3 was formed in an 81% yield,
but the reaction took 48 h (Table 2, entry 10). Increasing the amount of cat. HCl by 2-
or 3-fold did not result in an increase in yield or reaction time.
The combination of DMSO and cat. H2SO4 (Table 2, entry 11) did not
result in the formation any pyrazole after 5 h; however, when performing
the reaction in the presence of both cat. HCl and cat. H2SO4, the reaction was complete within 5 h and pyrazole 3 was obtained in 83% yield (Table 2, entry 12). No pyrazole product was formed
when the reaction was performed with just DMSO (no I2 or
acid, Table 2, entry
13).

We prepared a series of pyrazoles (3, 16–25) by reacting acetophenones (7–12) with aryl hydrazones (2, 13–15) in refluxing EtOH and in
the presence
of either cat. HCl/4 equiv DMSO/cat. I2 (method A), cat.
HCl/4 equiv DMSO (method B), or, to a lesser extent, cat. HCl/cat.
H2SO4/4 equiv DMSO (method C) (Table 3). Method A provided the pyrazoles
in good to excellent yield usually within 10–16 h. The exception
was the 4-amino derivative 19, which did not give any
pyrazole product. Acetophenones bearing electron-donating groups tended
to take longer to react than acetophenone (i.e., entries 1–3
versus entries 4–6). Method B also gave the pyrazoles in good
yield, though, as expected, the reaction times were longer than with
method A. Method C was examined for the preparation of pyrazoles 3, 16, 18, and 19 (entries
4, 7, and 10). This method was successful in all four cases, though
the yields were slightly lower compared to method A and the purification
more challenging.

a Method A: Ketone
added to 1.2 equiv
of the aldehyde hydrazone in ethanol followed by cat. aq HCl. Reflux
for 1 h and then add 4 equiv DMSO and 10 mol % I2.

b Method B: Same as method A, except
no I2 added.

c Method C: Same as method B, except
cat. HCl and cat. H2SO4 added at the beginning.

d Isolated yield.

We also attempted to prepare 3,5-diaryl-4-aryloxypyrazoles
by reacting
2-phenoxyacetophenone (5) with aryl hydrazones using
methods A or B; however, this did not afford 4-aryloxypyrazoles, but
rather the 4-unsubstituted pyrazoles (Table 5). We later found that the reaction does
not require DMSO or I2 to proceed and requires just cat.
HCl (entry 5), suggesting that the reaction proceeds in a manner similar
to when using bromoacetophenone. The HCl probably helps promote the
formation of intermediate I (Schemes 1 or 2, where Br is replaced with OPh) and may also aid in the loss of
PhOH by acting as general acid. The fact that the reaction of hydrazone 2 with 2-phenoxyacetophenone in the absence of added acid
did not produce pyrazole 3 (Table 1, entry 7) indicates that the presence of
acid is essential for pyrazole formation when using 2-phenoxyacetophenone
as one of the substrates. In the case of the reaction of hydrazone 2 with 2-bromoacetophenone (1) (i.e., Table 1, entry 4), no exogenous
acid was required for pyrazole formation. This may be due to the formation
of HBr during the reaction, which helps promote the formation of intermediate
I.

The reverse approach, using ketone hydrazones (26 and 27) and benzaldehydes (28–32), also provided pyrazoles in good yield (Table 4). Pyrazoles can be prepared
in very good
yield using either approach or either methodology A or B, as evidenced
by the synthesis of pyrazoles 20, 22, and 23 (Table 3, entries 13 and 14 and 17–20 and Table 4, entries 1 and 6–9).

no I2 added.

c Isolated yield.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a method for preparing 3,5-diarylpyrazoles
in good to excellent yields by reacting aryl or ketone hydrazones
with acetophenones or aryl aldehydes in EtOH and using only catalytic
amounts of I2 or acid and a modest excess of DMSO to promote
the reaction. The substrates are readily available or easily prepared
and the reagents common and very inexpensive. 3,5-Diarylpyrazoles
were also obtained in good yield by reacting 2-bromoacetophenones
or 2-phenoxyacetophone/cat. HCl with aryl hydrazones. We are now employing
these procedures to prepare libraries of 3,5-diarylpyrazoles, which
will be examined as potential anticancer agents.
