Highly accurate quantitative detection of heavy metals
is essential
for environmental pollution monitoring and health safety. Here, for
selective detection of Cu2+ ions with high sensitivity,
thiacalix[4]arene (TCA) immobilized on graphene field-effect transistors
(G-FETs) are developed. Our proposed TCA-immobilized G-FETs are successfully
used to detect Cu2+ ions at concentrations ranging from
1 μM to 1 mM via changes in their transfer characteristics.
Moreover, the measured transfer characteristics clearly shift only
when Cu2+ ions are introduced in the buffer solution despite
it containing other metal ions, including those of Na+,
Mg2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+; this selective
detection of Cu2+ ions is attributed to the planar arrangement
of TCA on graphene. Therefore, TCA-immobilized G-FETs selectively
detect Cu2+ with high sensitivity.

Introduction
Detection of heavy metal ions is necessary
for environmental monitoring
and health safety.1 In the same vein, identification
and quantification of heavy metal ions is crucial for determining
water quality.2−7 Currently, conventional analytical approaches such as atomic absorption
spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry
have been utilized in laboratory settings to identify and quantify
heavy metal ions in environmental and biological samples.8−12 However, these approaches are not suitable for onsite analysis of
heavy metal concentrations owing to the size of the equipment used
for them. In addition, heavy metal analysis is not straightforward
owing to the complexity of the analytical processes and relatively
long measurement times. Considering this, portable devices that can
be used for highly sensitive onsite detection of heavy metal ions
are needed. Thus, in this study, we developed graphene-based devices
to achieve this.

Graphene is a one-atom-thick two-dimensional
carbon sheet characterized
by high carrier mobility and chemical stability, which can also be
used for device miniaturization.13,14 Owing to these
properties, in recent times, graphene has attracted significant attention
as a sensor material in sensor devices. An example of such a device
is the graphene field-effect transistor (G-FET).15−19 In particular, when charged molecules are adsorbed
on graphene channels in G-FETs, the adsorbed molecules induce carriers
on the graphene channels, resulting a shift in the charge neutrality
point of G-FETs.20 In addition, because
of the high carrier mobility of graphene,13,14 these shifts lead to significant changes in the drain current. Consequently,
G-FETs can be used to detect molecules with high sensitivity. However,
graphene alone cannot be used for selective detection of different
target molecules. Therefore, to obtain selectivity, different types
of receptors, such as antibodies, aptamers, enzymes, DNA, and supramolecules,
immobilized on graphene have been used in previous studies.20−29

In this work, to achieve selectivity, we study the use of
thiacalix[4]arene
(TCA) as a receptor. TCA is composed of benzene rings linked via sulphide
bridges;30−33 it is known to form complexes with various heavy metal ions owing
to its different conformations and the presence of bridging sulfur
atoms.34−37 The coordination between TCA and different heavy metal ions occurs
through three-dimensional coordinated structures.38−40 In particular,
owing to its three-dimensional coordinated structure, TCA adsorbs
several different heavy metal ions without selectivity. However, for
selective detection of specific heavy metal ions, the coordination
structure of metal ions needs to be modulated.

In our work,
to realize selective detection of Cu2+,
planar-coordinated structures between TCA and Cu2+ were
formed by immobilizing TCA on the surface of graphene. This immobilization
occurs because of π–π stacking between TCA and
graphene, which limits the coordination forms of TCA.41,42 Our analysis results revealed that TCA-immobilized G-FETs electrically
responded to Cu2+ ions over a wide concentration range,
thus demonstrating their potential utility for monitoring Cu2+ ion concentrations, despite the presence of various other metal
ions in solutions.

Results and Discussion
Detection of Cu2+ Ions Using TCA-Immobilized G-FETs
In this study, we demonstrated the detection of Cu2+ ions using TCA-immobilized G-FETs. Figure 1 shows the transfer characteristics of TCA-immobilized
G-FETs before and after introducing Cu2+ ions at concentrations
of 1, 10, 30, 100, and 300 μM. Bipolar characteristics were
observed for the buffer solutions at all Cu2+ concentrations.
Because the leakage current of G-FETs is 1000 times smaller than the
drain current, the leakage current is negligible for detection of
Cu2+. The results revealed that the transfer characteristics
shifted in the positive gate-voltage direction when Cu2+ ions are introduced, indicating that G-FETs can be used to detect
Cu2+ ions based on these electrical measurement changes.
Furthermore, the shifts in the transfer curves increased with increasing
Cu2+ concentration; in particular, the shift at a Cu2+ concentration of 300 μM was as large as ∼200
mV. Also, the average of the shifts at 300 μM was 186 ±
20 mV; the results indicated that G-FETs have repeatability for detection
of Cu2+ ions. The observed positive shifts in Figure 1 were different from
the results in a previous study that used G-FET-based sensors, wherein
the accumulation of positive charges on graphene channels in G-FETs
led to negative shifts in transfer curves.43 In contrast, our results shown in Figure 1 imply that the charge distribution in TCA
changed because of the formation of complexes between Cu2+ and TCA, as shown in Figure 2;44−46 in turn, this change in the charge distribution induced
potential changes in the graphene channel, resulting in the positive
shift in transfer characteristics.

Cu2+ concentrations.

Cu2+ Concentration Dependence
Next, the
dependence of Cu2+ ion concentration on voltage characteristics
of TCA-immobilized G-FETs was investigated. The transfer characteristics
were measured every 5 min, and the Dirac-point voltage (VDP) was plotted. Figure 3a shows the shifts in VDP with time for various ion concentrations of Cu2+ ranging
from 0 to 1 mM; the results shown in the figure reveal that the shift
in VDP increased with increasing Cu2+ ion concentration. Furthermore, change in VDP almost stopped within 15 min at each Cu2+ concentration. This occurs because the adsorption of Cu2+ ions on TCA attains an equilibrium state. Therefore, G-FETs with
TCA can be used to detect Cu2+ ions in a concentration
range of 1 μM to 1 mM within 15 min. Figure 3b shows the amount of VDP shift as a function of concentration of Cu2+ ranging
from 0 to 1 mM. The result reveals that the VDP shift increases linearly with the concentration of Cu2+ ranging from 0 to 300 μM. On the other hand, the VDP shift at 1 mM is slightly deviated from the
linearity, indicating that the VDP shift
gradually saturated over 300 μM.

ion concentrations of Cu2+ and (b) shift in VDP shift as a function of concentration of Cu2+ ranging from 0 to 1 mM.

Selectivity of TCA-Immobilized G-FETs for Cu2+ Ions
To investigate the selectivity of TCA-immobilized G-FETs for Cu2+, the shifts in VDP were measured
in Tris-HCl buffer containing other metal ions (Na+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+). Figure 4a shows these shifts in VDP when Na+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ ions at concentrations of 500 μM
each were sequentially added to the solution, after which Cu2+ ions at concentrations of 50 and 500 μM were added; the results
show that VDP did not clearly shift when
Na+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ ions were introduced in the solution. In contrast, a clear VDP shift was observed when Cu2+ ions
were introduced in the solution. Therefore, TCA-immobilized G-FETs
showed selective detection of Cu2+ ions even in a solution
containing other metal ions. Figure 4b shows the changes in VDP for each metal ion (Na+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+) at concentrations of 500
μM in the form of a bar graph. In particular, the VDP shift at 500 μM was observed to be over 100 mV
for Cu2+ ions, which was more than 10 times larger than
those recorded when Na+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ ions were introduced. This selectivity for
Cu2+ ions results from the immobilization of TCA on the
graphene channel. The recognition of Cu2+ ions using TCA
immobilized on graphene can be explained using the hard and soft acids
and bases (HSAB) theory and the ligand field theory.47,48 According to the HSAB theory, soft metal ions (Cu2+,
Ni2+, and Cd2+) tend to easily coordinate with
sulfur atoms. Results from previous works indicate that TCA dispersed
in solution captures not only Cu2+ ions, but also Ni2+ and Cd2+ ions through the liquid–liquid
extraction method.35,49 However, it is interesting to
note that, compared with these previous works, our results indicate
that TCA on the graphene surfaces capture only Cu2+ ions,
which, in turn, implies that the space degrees of freedom of TCA were
limited by immobilizing it on graphene surfaces. In particular, in
the case of the liquid–liquid extraction method, the orientation
and position of TCA changes relatively freely in solutions; consequently,
several different heavy metal ions are surrounded by three TCA molecules
leading to their adsorption.35,49 However, when immobilized
on G-FETs, TCA was planarly placed on the graphene surfaces; therefore,
TCA cannot surround and adsorb several types of heavy metal ions when
it is immobilized so. The coordination between Cu2+ ions
and G-FETs occurs via the host–guest interaction. As depicted
in Figure 5, Cu2+ ions are generally coordinated in a square shape, as are
the bridging sulfur atoms in TCA leading to the coordination of the
bridging sulfur atoms with Cu2+ ions and their subsequent
adsorption.50 On the contrary, coordination
forms of the other heavy metal ions are not of square type, but instead
are of tetrahedron and octahedron types, which is why they do not
coordinate with TCA immobilized on graphene.51 In summary, the selectivity of G-FETs for Cu2+ ions is
attributed to the immobilization of TCA on graphene surfaces in G-FETs.
Therefore, G-FETs can be successfully used in the selective detection
of Cu2+.

Conclusions
In this study, we fabricated Cu2+ sensors using TCA-immobilized
G-FETs. The transfer characteristics shifted in the positive gate-voltage
direction on introducing Cu2+ ions in the solution; in
addition, the VDP shift increased as the
Cu2+ concentration was increased from 1 μM to 1 mM,
which indicates that G-FETs can be used for quantitative analysis
of Cu2+. Furthermore, TCA-immobilized G-FETs were able
to successfully detect Cu2+ ions selectively in a buffer
solution containing several different metal ions, viz., Na+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ ions. In
particular, the amount of VDP shift on
introducing Cu2+ ions at a concentration of 500 μM
was about 10 times larger than that on introducing Na+,
Mg2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ ions at the
same concentration. Therefore, our results indicate that the TCA-immobilized
G-FETs provide high sensitivity and selectivity for the detection
of Cu2+ ions, making them promising candidates as portable
Cu2+ sensors. Moreover, our research shows the importance
of coordination structures between TCA and metal ions for the detection
of specific metal ions using G-FETs. Moreover, in a manner similar
to the approach followed in our study, other heavy metal ion sensors
could be realized by adjusting the molecular structure to ensure the
formation of a coordinate structure between the molecule and metal
ions.

Experimental Methods
Fabrication Process for G-FETs
First, monolayer graphene
was synthesized on Cu foil (JX Nippon Mining & Metals, HA) via
chemical vapor deposition. Before use, the Cu foil was annealed under
a flow of 3% H2 and 97% Ar at 500 sccm for 41 min to remove
any native oxide so that Cu exhibits catalytic activity. Graphene
was synthesized at 1035 °C by cracking CH4 under both
3% H2 and 97% Ar flow at 15 sccm, and 5% CH4 and 95% Ar flow at 1500 sccm for 35 min. Next, the graphene was
transferred onto a Si/SiO2 substrate using poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA) and annealed at 330 °C for 1 h under a 3%
H2 and 97% Ar flow to remove impurities such as residual
PMMA. Subsequently, Ni(10 nm) and Au(30 nm) were deposited as sources
and drain electrodes via a photolithography technique. The channel
distance and width for the source and drain were approximately 5 and
15 μm, respectively.52

Adsorption of TCA on Graphene and Measurement Methods
After G-FETs ware fabricated, a 50 μM solution was prepared
by dissolving TCA (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co.) in chloroform. Then,
the G-FETs were immersed in this prepared solution to immobilize TCA
on graphene through π–π interactions between them.41,42 These G-FETs were then taken out of the solution and dried to obtain
the required graphene-based sensors. Next, a silicon rubber pool was
attached to the G-FETs so that the graphene channel could be immersed
in a Tris-HCl buffer (20 mM, pH 8.0). A saturated Ag/AgCl electrode
was used as the reference electrode.53 NaCl,
MgCl2, CdSO4, NiSO4, and CuSO4 solutions at various concentrations were added to the Tris-HCl
buffer solution to increase the Na+, Mg2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ concentrations in
the reagent solution, respectively. The transfer characteristics of
the G-FETs were measured by applying a drain voltage of 50 mV using
a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keysight Technologies, B2912).
