Chemical warfare
agents such as sarin are highly toxic, and detection
of even trace levels is important. Using a hydrogel film containing
a built-in two-dimensional chemical potential gradient, we demonstrate
the detection of a sarin simulant under conditions potentially as
low as a level 1 (6.90 × 10–9 mg/cm3 for 10 min) Acute Exposure Guideline Level sarin exposure. Specifically,
the sarin simulant diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) is aerosol-deposited
on a hydrogel film containing a built-in ionic chemical gradient and
the enzyme, diisopropyl fluorophosphatase (DFPase). DFPase degrades
the DFP, releasing fluoride ions. The fluoride ions are then concentrated
by the gradient to a miniature electrochemical sensor embedded in
the hydrogel providing a 30-fold amplification of the fluoride ion
signal, which is an indication of exposure to DFP, relative to a gradient-free
system. This method is general for agents which hydrolyze into chemically
detectable ionic species.

==== Body
Introduction
The highly toxic G-type
nerve agents, including sarin (GB), soman
(GD), and cyclosarin (GF), are considered weapons of mass destruction.
Upon inhalation or dermal penetration, the G-agents attack the nervous
system by interfering with the degradation of the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine, leading to death.1,2 Permanent damage to
the nervous system can also occur at nonlethal doses.3 Immediate application of antidotes to an affected person
can prevent permanent damage; however, low-level nerve agents’
exposure leads to ambiguous signs and symptoms that cannot be easily
discriminated from other conditions, which may result in a delay in
treatment and permanent damage.4 Because
of this, extensive efforts have been made to develop sensors for sarin
and similar compounds; however, detection at Acute Exposure Guideline
Level 1 (AEGL-1) (6.9 × 10–9 mg/cm3 for 10 min for sarin) remains challenging.5−9

To detect trace concentration of agents, extensive
efforts have
been made to develop signal amplification techniques.10−14 Although methods such as polymerase chain reaction enable orders
of magnitude amplification of DNA sequences, methods such as this
do not work for small molecules. To enhance the detection of small
molecules, fluorescence quenching approaches have been suggested,
for example, using conjugated polymer-based sensors in which long-range
exciton diffusion enables a single analyte molecule to quench a significant
volume of materials.15 Such an approach
has been demonstrated to enable the detection of nerve agents in solution
in the parts per billion level;16 however,
in the solid state, only sub-parts per million level detection has
been demonstrated.9 Recently, a 4-fold
signal amplification method inspired by nature utilizing autoinductive
cascade formation of fluoride ions, with the initial fluoride ion
coming from sarin, has been reported; however, this process takes
at least 4 h.17

We previously reported
that chemical gradients in hydrogel films
are able to concentrate model analytes (charged dye molecules) at
least 40-fold (over 24 h) by biasing diffusion such that the dye is
directionally transported to a central region of the film at a rate
of few micrometers per minute.18 This potentially
overcomes the “needle in a haystack” problem for nano-sized
sensors.19 While we believe the concept
of gradient-directed transport is attractive for enhancing the detection
limit of a sensor, the slow transport velocity limits the applicability
for real-time detection. Here, we demonstrate rapid (minutes) chemical
gradient-enhanced detection of a nerve agent stimulant using an approach
in which the target molecule is first fragmented by a catalyst into
pieces, at least one of which is rapidly diffusing and easy to detect,
followed by the gradient-directed transport of these fragments to
a chemically specific sensor. In greater detail, the agent first adsorbs
into an enzyme-containing gel film. Then, the enzyme degrades the
agent, releasing F–. The internal ionic gradient
within the gel subsequently directionally transports the F ions to
a miniaturized F-ion-specific sensor imbedded in the gel at the focusing
point of the chemical gradient. The advantages of this approach over
attempting the concentration and detection of the initial agent are
several folds. First, realization of a gradient which drives the transport
of ions is much more straightforward than the realization of a gradient
for the uncharged molecular species. Second, monatomic ions generally
diffuse more rapidly than molecules. Third, there are well-established,
specific, and quantitative electrochemical sensors for monatomic ions.

For a proof-of-concept studies, simulants for highly toxic fluoride-containing
“G series” chemical warfare agents (CWAs) containing
enzymatically degradable P–F or P–Cl bonds were selected
[for safety reasons, we demonstrate the concept using the sarin simulants
diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and diethyl chlorophosphite (DCP)].
Concentrated F– ions were detected electrochemically,
whereas Cl– ions were detected fluorometrically.

Materials
and Methods
Highly water-swollen polyacrylamide (PAAm)-based
hydrogels were
chosen as the host media because they can be easily functionalized,
are known to serve as good hosts for enzymes, and are relatively robust
to a variety of chemical environments. The PAAm gels were synthesized
by free radical photopolymerization. The chemical modification of
PAAm films involved two steps, hydrolysis and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride-assisted coupling
of functional groups (Figure S2). The gradient
shape was controlled during the hydrolysis step as shown in Figure 1b,c.18 Details of the synthesis and chemical modification of PAAm
hydrogel films can be found in Supporting Information Section S2. All experiments were performed with ca. 30 μm
thick hydrogel films (unless otherwise noted) covalently attached
to acrylate-functionalized glass substrates. The thickness of the
film is significantly less than the gradient length (several millimeters);
therefore, ion transportation is effectively two-dimensional.

Results and Discussion
We start by ascertaining the rate of Cl– diffusion
in a gradient-free hydrogel and the rate of directional transport
of Cl– in an ionic gradient-containing hydrogel.
Aqueous lucigenin (1 mM), a fluorescent chloride indicator, was sprayed
(dosing of about 75 μg/cm2) on the surface of the
2 × 2 cm2 hydrogel films using a spray atomizer. For
determination of the rate of Cl– diffusion in a
gradient-free hydrogel, a trace amount of Cl– was
dosed on a 1 mm diameter area on the surface of a gel using a sharp
needle, which had been dipped into a 0.1 M HCl solution. In presence
of Cl–, lucigenin’s fluorescence was quenched
as shown in Figure 2b.20 As expected, the quenched spot spread
isotropically. The Cl– diffusion constant was determined
to be 1 × 10–9 m2/s by observing
the evolution of the diameter of the quenched region (see Supporting Information Section S7.1 for details
of the analysis). Under these conditions, the hydrogel is ∼90%
water, and thus, not surprisingly, the Cl– ion diffusion
constant was similar to that found in aqueous solution.21,22

containing an anionic sulfate gradient and two immobilized pH indicator
regions.

A cationic quaternary ammonium
gradient was chosen to transport
Cl–, given the affinity of Cl– for the quaternary ammonium group. Both a linear gradient with a
length of ca. 7 mm and a radially symmetric gradient with a radius
of ca. 4 mm were formed.18 The overall
effect of the gradient is to create an enthalpy gradient for Cl– as illustrated in Figure 1d. The directional transport of Cl– using a neutral-to-cationic gradient consisting of a neutral polymer
(PAAm) at one end and the cationic quaternary ammonium-functionalized
PAAm on the other end was then investigated. Figure 2d(i) shows the result when a small area (∼1
mm in diameter) of the indicator-containing gel was dosed with Cl– using the technique indicated above. The quenched
spot spreads anisotropically, with the net transport being toward
the quaternary ammonium-rich end of the gradient, driven by interactions
between the cationic quaternary ammonium group and Cl–. To determine the gradient-imposed drift velocity, a COMSOL multiphysics
simulation (ver. 5.2) was used to model the system using the two-dimensional
diffusion–convection equation 1  where D(x,y) is
the local ion diffusion constant, v⃗(x,y) is the
gradient-imposed drift velocity, and c is the concentration
of ions. The gradient-imposed drift velocity of Cl– was determined to be ∼1.1 × 10–6 m/s,
which is ca. 20-fold greater than the drift velocity of charged organic
dyes in similar gradients (5 × 10–8 m/s).18

A similar approach was utilized to demonstrate
the cation, for
example, H+, transport using PAAm hydrogel films containing
an anionic sulfate gradient (sulfanilic acid was coupled to the hydrogel
through its amine group) (Figure 2f). Prior to analysis, the film was rinsed with deionized
water, and the pH of the film was ∼7.0. As a first attempt,
a pH sensitive dye was sprayed on the film, and we expected we would
observe the movement of H+ through changes over time in
the dye color. However, no color changes were observed over time,
perhaps because of the strong binding of the dye to the H+. Instead, two drops (0.5 μL) of silica gels (see Supporting Information for the synthesis of dye-silica
gels) containing bromothymol blue, a pH 6.0–7.6 indicator,
were placed in two different locations on the hydrogel film via a
sol–gel method,23,24 one drop in the anionic area
and the other drop in the neutral area. Use of a sol–gel approach
immobilized the dye molecule in the hydrogel. A 0.2 μL of 0.25
M HCl was placed using a microsyringe at a location centered between
the two indicators as shown in Figure 2f. A hint of color change (from blue to yellow) was
seen after 40 min in the dye located in the anionic sulfate side.
The color change progressed and changed completely within 60 min.
No change in color was observed in the dye region in the neutral area,
suggesting that H+ traveled under the influence of the
gradient at approximately 2.7 × 10–5 m/s (about
5 times the velocity observed for Cl– under the
influence of a gradient). The reason for the difference in velocity
may be in part because lucigenin reversibly binds Cl– and may reduce its transport rate.

To evaluate the potential
for gradient-directed concentration (an
important property for many detection schemes), a radially symmetric
neutral-to-cationic gradient was prepared. Lucigenin dye was introduced
into the film using the same method discussed previously. An ∼30
μg/cm2 of a 10 mM aqueous HCl solution (∼11
ng/cm2 of HCl) was dosed onto the film using an atomizer,
and fluorescence images were taken overtime (Figure 3b). A line profile of fluorescence over the
radially symmetric gradient was plotted against position as a function
of time. It was seen that the fluorescence intensity was initially
nearly homogeneous (Figure 3b(i)), indicating that after a short time, the atomizer-deposited
Cl– has diffused only sufficiently to smear out
the spray droplet pattern. A short time later, as sufficient Cl– crossed the “event horizon”, the outer
edge of the gradient, and began to accumulate at the gradient center,
fluorescence quenching in the gradient center begins.18 Over time, a distinct fluorescence quenching was observed
at the center of the radially symmetric gradient indicative of an
increase in Cl– concentration. Assuming the Stern–Volmer
constant for lucigenin in the hydrogel is the same as in aqueous solution,
390 M–1,20 the concentration
enhancement of Cl– in the concentrating region was
found to be as high as 30-fold within 5 min. Interestingly, there
is a bright ring around the edge of the gradient because of local
depletion of Cl– in that region, which is caused
by the fact that Cl– is being pulled out of that
region over the event horizon into the center of the gradient faster
than it is being replenished by free diffusion into that region.18

images of the hydrogel film 1, 3, and 5 min after Cl– dosing. (c) Line profiles of fluorescence intensity crossing the
origin of a radially symmetric gradient as indicated by the dashed
lines in (b).

As a first demonstration
of the use of a gradient to detect nerve
agents, ∼15 μg/cm2 of a 0.1 M DCP solution
in ethyl acetate (∼280 ng/cm2 of the simulant DCP)
was sprayed on a PAAm hydrogel. As the DCP molecules diffused into
the hydrogel, they hydrolyzed, yielding Cl–. The
pH of the hydrogel was set as ca. 10 to accelerate the hydrolysis
process by dipping the hydrogel in 5 mM NaOH solution, a pH at which
the half-life for the hydrolysis of sarin is 5.4 min.25,26 It is noted that P–Cl bonds are significantly weaker than
P–F bonds (326 and 490 kJ mol–1, respectively).27 If needed, the hydrolysis rate could be accelerated
by imbedding nucleophilic agents (such as oxime or a catalyst) in
the hydrogel.8,28−30 For one specific
experiment, the hydrogel film on the substrate was physically separated
into two regions by peeling a strip of hydrogel off the substrate,
creating a physical barrier for ion exchange. One region contained
a radially symmetric gradient and the other was gradient-free. Figure 4b shows a fluorescence
image taken 30 min after spraying the stimuli. A clear indication
of Cl– concentration in the center of the radially
symmetric gradient is the quenching of fluorescence at the center
of the gradient. One issue with detection using this approach is that
as already mentioned, lucigenin reversibly binds Cl– and thus may slow the Cl– transport rate.

presence of water in the PAAm hydrogel. (b) Fluorescence image of
a PAAm hydrogel containing both gradient and gradient-free regions,

intensity crossing the origin of a radially symmetric gradient shown
on the left is indicated by the dashed line.

While an approach for the enhanced detection of Cl– ions is interesting, and perhaps useful for detecting a few nerve
agents such as chlorosarin, there are a number of practical issues
with the approach described above. First, a turn-off fluorescence
detection method is not attractive, as there are a number of effects
that could lead to fluorescence quenching. Second, Cl– is ubiquitous in the environment. Third, detection of sarin is of
greater importance than the detection of chlorosarin. We decided therefore
to look for a selective and quantitative approach that could detect
F–, one of the products of hydrolysis of sarin.
Fortunately, highly specific and sensitive electrochemical sensors
for F– are commercially available.18 In neutral solutions, the detection limit of this sensor
is as low as 20 ppb in 30 s. This is comparable to gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS), which is considered as the gold standard
for nerve agent detection. However, unlike GC–MS, which requires
relatively large and sophisticated instrumentation, an electrochemical
sensor requires only simple instrumentation. Crucially, an electrochemical
sensor could easily be integrated with a hydrogel film.

As described
in the experimental section, we fabricated a 2 mm
diameter electrochemical fluoride ion sensor and placed it at the
center of the radially symmetric gradient in the gel. The gel system
consisted of a thin layer (∼5 μm) of a diisopropyl fluorophosphatase
(DFPase) imbedded hydrogel on top of a thicker (ca. 100 μm)
PAAm hydrogel containing a radially symmetric neutral-to-cationic
tertiary ammonium gradient, which is attached to a glass substrate
using a 17 μm thick SU-8 layer (see Supporting Information Sections S2.3 and S5). The SU-8 layer prevents
fluoride ions in the gel from reacting with the glass substrate. Proof-of-concept
sarin detection studies were performed by spraying two different doses
of a 5 mM solution of DFP in ethanol on the gel surface. After spraying
the simulant, the gels were left in a chamber for 30 min at relative
humidity = 100%. Because of the presence of DFPase, DFP is rapidly
hydrolyzed forming F– (at pH 7, DFP is hydrolyzed
by DFPase at a rate of 81 μmol L–1 s–1).2,31,32 The F– ions are then driven to the center of the gradient
by the imbedded radially symmetric neutral-to-cationic tertiary ammonium
gradient. F– activities were monitored by the sensor
at both the center of the gradient and outside of the gradient.

It is important to note that the cationic quaternary ammonium-based
gradient directs the transport of F– by means of
electrostatic interactions between the cationic quaternary ammonium
group and the fluoride ion, reducing the activity of F– in the gradient region of the hydrogel. Because the electrode is
measuring the fluoride ion activity, not the concentration, the effect
of the gradient on activity needs to be considered. The thermodynamic
activity, that is, the effective concentration of F– in presence of ammonium ion, is defined as 2  where γ is the activity
coefficient, ci is the
measured concentration
of F– in the pristine gel, and cø is the dosing concentration of
F–. Because of the electrostatic interactions between
the fluoride and tertiary ammonium ions, the activity coefficient
of fluoride ions in an ammonium-functionalized gel was reduced to
0.15 ± 0.02 (see Supporting Information S8.2). Thus, at the center of the gradient, the F– activity was determined to be 6-times lower than the F– concentration (see Supporting Information Sections S8.2 and S8.4) relative to that in a pristine PAAm gel.

Accounting the activity coefficient, the dosing concentration (assuming
all simulants were hydrolyzed to produce the fluoride ion) versus
the calibrated concentration at these two regions is shown in Figure 5c. A 30-fold increase
in F– concentration was measured at the center of
the gradient relative to the dosing concentration [the theoretical
upper bound showed a 57-fold concentration enhancement (see Supporting Information Section S9 for the calculation)].
The net effect of the concentration enhancement and the reduction
of activity caused by the quaternary ammonium groups were that with
the current state system we could directly detect as little as 70
ng of sarin (see Supporting Information Section S9). This detection limit is potentially comparable to AEGL-1
for sarin (see Supporting Information Section
S9 for a detailed discussion of our assumptions), the exposure level
that generates notable, but still reversible upon cessation of exposure,
discomfort, irritation, or certain asymptomatic nonsensory effects.33

enzyme sensor showing the placement of the fluoride-sensitive and

PAAm layer (∼5 μm thick) sitting above a PAAm (∼100
μm thick) layer containing an embedded neutral-to-cationic radially
symmetric gradient designed to concentrate F–. (c)

of F– at the center of the gradient and outside
the gradient 30 min after DFP dosing, assuming complete hydrolysis
of DFP. Arrows indicate the calculated concentration of sarin absorbed
in the gel for an AEGL-1 exposure, and the concentration of sarin
at the center of the gradient after 30-fold concentration (assuming
sarin is fully hydrolyzed). The electrochemical sensor limit of detection
is shown by the grayed-out region.

In summary, the directional transport of ions up to several
millimeters
using hydrogel films containing built-in ionic chemical gradients
was demonstrated. The gradient-imposed drift velocity was in the range
of several micrometers per second, 2 orders of magnitude higher than
the gradient-directed transport of a molecular species. For the subset
of important CWAs, which hydrolyze into chemically detectable ionic
species, yielding an ionic product, this approach provides an unprecedented
opportunity for chemical sensing. The gradients used may also find
applications in the study of ion diffusion in biological systems and
could be used for surface-directed ion separation.34
