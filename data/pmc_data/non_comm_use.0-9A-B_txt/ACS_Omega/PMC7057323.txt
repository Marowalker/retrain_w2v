Inadvertent inhalation of various
volatile organic compounds during
industrial processes, such as coal and metal mining, metal manufacturing,
paper and pulp industry, food processing, petroleum refining, and
concrete and chemical industries, has caused an adverse effect on
human health. In particular, exposure to trimethylamine (TMA), a fishy
odor poisonous gas, resulted in numerous health hazards such as neurotoxicity,
irritation in eyes, nose, skin, and throat, blurred vision, and many
more. According to the environmental protection agency, TMA in the
level of 0.10 ppm is generally considered as safe, and excess dose
results in “trimethylaminuria” or “fish odor
syndrome.” In order to avoid the health hazards associated
with the inhalation of TMA, there is an urge to design a sensor for
TMA detection even at low levels for use in food-processing industries,
medical diagnosis, and environment. In this report, for the first
time, we have developed a TMA sensor fabric using a sequential self-assembly
process from silver-incorporated glycolipids. Formation of self-assembled
supramolecular architecture, interaction of the assembled structure
with the cotton fabric, and sensing mechanism were completely investigated
with the help of various instrumental methods. To our surprise, the
developed fabric displayed a transient response for 1–500 ppm
of TMA and a stable response toward 100 ppm of TMA for 15 days. We
believe that the reported flexible TMA sensor fabrics developed via
the sequential self-assembly process hold great promise for various
innovative applications in environment, healthcare, medicine, and
biology.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Emission of toxic gases
and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into
the atmosphere from industries, evaporation of organic solvents, petroleum
products, and other human activities are a grave threat to living
organisms. Emission of VOCs causes many health hazards owing to their
vital role in many photochemical reactions, forming harmful products
with toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic properties.1ence, detection of VOCs has become a frontline research
in recent years, and there is a huge demand for the development of
sensors for VOCs. Among the various VOCs, trimethylamine (TMA, C3H9N) is a type of colorless, flammable, fishy odor,
and poisonous gas, which is generated naturally during the intestinal
biodegradation of choline and carnitine rich foods such as fish, egg
yolk, soybeans, peas, and so forth and during the biodegradation of
damp building material, plants, fish, and other sea food and animal
products.2−5 Exposure to even a trace amount of TMA vapor can cause irritation
of the eyes, nose, skin, throat, and respiratory system as well as
vomiting, cough, dyspnea, blurred vision, difficulty in swallowing,
head ache, abdominal pain, and neurotoxicity.6 Excessive accumulation of TMA in the body fluids leads to “trimethylaminuria”
or “fish odor syndrome.” Nevertheless, there is an urge
to develop a facile sensor to detect TMA for use in food-processing
industries, medical diagnosis, and environment.

Traditionally,
various analytical methods such as gas chromatography,
liquid chromatography, and ion mobility spectrometry were employed
to detect TMA vapors. Recently, chemical gas sensors based on semiconducting
metal oxides were used because of its rapid, high response, and cost-effective
sensing. However, device fabrication, sensitivity, and selectivity
are the foremost problems associated with the semiconducting metal
oxide-based gas sensors. In order to overcome the existing limitation
and to amplify the selectivity and sensitivity, various efforts such
as modulation of sensor temperature, doping with catalytic oxides,
loading of noble-metal catalysts, and so forth were made.2,7−13 Recent studies revealed that several metal-oxide sensors such as
TiO2,12,14−16 ZnO,17−19 MoO3,2,20−23 SnO2,24 and Fe2O325,26 and composites such as ZnO–Al2O3/TiO2/V2O5,27−29 SnO2–ZnO,30 ZnO–Cr2O3,31 ZnO–In2O3,32 and so forth have been used for TMA detection.
However, the usage of gas sensors based on inorganic semiconductors
results in the accumulation of metals in the environment and pose
severe pollution at various levels. Recently, metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs), the porous materials obtained via the self-assembly
of organic ligands and inorganic metal ions or clusters, were used
in various applications such as catalysis, gas storage and separation,
drug delivery, sensing, and so forth owing to their structural flexibility
and tunable porosity.33−42 Chidambaram and Stylianou have highlighted the importance of MOFs
and their potential to sense various gases and vapors such as alkanes,
aldehydes, TMA, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and nitric oxide.42 Interest toward the design and synthesis of
functional molecules for the construction of molecular devices suitable
for applications like drug delivery, catalysis, sensing, and forth
has increased substantially. In this regard, for the first time, we
report the formation of self-assembled silver-incorporated glycolipids,
GL-AgNPs, using the sequential self-assembly process and explore the
possibility of using them in constructing a conductive fabric for
sensing TMA vapors.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
Interest toward the design,
synthesis, and construction of functional molecules from renewable
resources has augmented a lot as they could serve as molecular devices
for sensing, switching, and signal selectivity. In this regard, we
constructed a functional molecule for sensor application by synthesizing
glycolipid 3 in good yield using a simple procedure involving
the reaction of gluconolactone 1 (1.0 mmol) with hydrazine
hydrate (1.5 mmol), followed by the addition of 2-hydroxy-4-pentadecylbenzaldehyde 2 (1.0 mmol) under reflux condition as reported in our previous
work (Scheme 1).43

Scheme 1 One Pot Synthesis of Glycolipid 3
After the synthesis and complete
characterization using nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry and mass spectral studies, the
gelation ability of glycolipid 3 was examined in a wide
range of solvents and oils using the “stable to inversion of
a test tube” method. Interestingly, glycolipid 3 displayed gelation in a wide range of solvents with the minimum
critical gelation concentration (CGC).43 To our surprise, morphological analysis of the gel formed by glycolipid 3 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (CGC = 0.5% w/v) displayed a helical
tubular architecture, and the detailed investigation is reported elsewhere.43 However, by getting clue from our recent results
on the morphological transition from the helical tubules of the gel
to the fibrous network architecture without even a change in the phase
driven by metal ions, we have prepared assembled GL-NPs 4a–c. A simple strategy for the synthesis of assembled nanomaterials
has created great interest among the researchers. In particular, access
to the finite nanoarchitecture via the coordination of metal to the
self-assembled supramolecular system is rather limited.45 On the most basic level, complementary small
molecules assembled via intermolecular interactions, such as H-bonding,
π–π interactions, van der Waals forces, anion and
cation−π interactions, and other weak interactions, having
metal recognition sites share the concept of most emerging MOFs and
supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs). In this report, we present
a metal-driven morphological transition in the supramolecular assembly
of small molecules via the coordination to generate a hybrid system
of MOF and SCC. In order to achieve the hybrid nanoarchitecture, a
solution of silver nitrate, copper acetate, and zinc acetate solutions
was added to the gel separately, displaying chiral helical tubules
architecture formed by supramolecular assembly (Figure 1). The added metal ions interacted with the
coordination site in the chiral helical tubules formed by compound 3 and further induced the morphological transition in the
gel without any phase change and generated a MOF–SCC hybrid
system (GL-NPs) displaying a fibrous structure. The supernatant solution
on the MOF–SCC hybrid gel was decanted and completely air dried.
The excess metal ions percolated in the fibrous structure of the gel
was removed by washing it very well with cold ethanol and then dried.
The dried GL-NPs were stored under desiccation and used for sensor
studies. Among the various GL-NPs, such as GL-CuNPs, GL-ZnNPs, and
GL-AgNPs, synthesized involving the concept of supramolecular assembly,
GL-AgNPs displayed better sensitivity toward TMA vapors in the preliminary
investigation. Based on the preliminary results, we have selected
GL-AgNPs for the fabrication of a conductive fabric using the concept
of intermolecular interactions. The dried self-assembled GL-AgNPs
were dispersed uniformly into 1,2-dichlorobenzene by sonication, and
a cotton fabric of 5 × 5 cm2 was kept immersed in
the dispersed solution of GL-AgNPs for about 24 h. The hydrophilic
part of GL-AgNPs interacted with the cellulose in the cotton fabric
and generated GL-AgNP-decorated cellulose (Figure 1). Self-assembly of GL-AgNPs on other fabrics,
such as silk, wool, and polyester, were not successful because of
the absence of free hydroxyl groups. Morphological transitions in
self-assembled glycolipid 3 from tubular to fibrillar
structure induced by Cu2+ and Zn2+ were reported
elsewhere.43 However, GL-AgNPs displayed
better sensitivity and selectivity toward various gases when compared
to GL-CuNPs and GL-ZnNPs. In the present study, we focus on the characterization
and explore the possible potential applications of self-assembled
GL-AgNPs and cotton fabric decorated with GL and GL-AgNPs.

Figure 1 Pictorial representation
of the formation of cotton fabric decorated
with GL-AgNPs.

Morphology of GL-AgNPs, pristine
fabric, GL-coated fabric, and
GL-AgNP-coated fabric were identified by the field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis (Figure 2). It can be seen from Figure 2a,b that the xerogel of GL-AgNPs displayed
a three-dimensional (3D) fibrous network structure displaying width
ranging from 200 to 400 nm.

fabric, GL-coated
fabric, and GL-AgNP-coated fabric using FESEM. (a,b) Xerogel of GL-AgNPs;

Energy-dispersive X-ray elemental mapping of C,
N, O, and Ag in
GL-AgNPs is shown in Figure 2c, which reveals the uniform distribution of AgNPs in the
fibrous architecture. Figure 2d,e reveals the existence of longitudinal smooth fibrils in
the pristine fabric. FESEM images of fabric coated with xerogel of 3 is shown in Figure 2f,g, which clearly revealed the presence of helical tubes
formed by the self-assembly of compound 3 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene
on to the fabric surface. However, a uniform coating of GL-AgNPs on
the cotton fabric was observed because of the H-bonding interaction
between the hydrophilic part of fibrils and cellulose (Figure 2h–n). EDX elemental
mapping of fabric coated with GL-AgNPs clearly indicated the uniform
interaction of AgNPs with the cellulose of cotton fabric via H-bonding
(Figure 2).

X-ray
diffraction analysis was carried out to provide further justification
for the formation of GL-AgNPs. The diffraction pattern of the xerogel
of glycolipid 3 displayed periodic peaks at 2θ
= 2.48, 4.96, 10.15, 15.24, and 20.43°,43 whereas GL-AgNPs showed peaks at 3.19, 4.89, 6.15, 10.06, 15.19,
20.30, 21.66, 32.24, and 38.04° (Figure 3a). Morphological transition-driven Ag+ can be identified from the appearance of the peak at 2θ
= 38.04° corresponding to the (111) plane of silver.46 XRD diffraction analysis of the fabric and GL-AgNP-coated
fabric also supports the existence of molecular self-assembly and
the incorporation of AgNPs in the coated cloth surface (Figure 3b).47

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a surface-sensitive
quantitative
method which helps in establishing the elemental composition, the
elements in the chemical and electronic states, and the nature of
interaction existing in the system. In order to investigate the nature
of interaction between AgNPs and fibrils of self-assembled glycolipid 3, XPS spectral analysis of helical tubules of glycolipid 3 was performed, which displayed signals corresponding to
C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s that on deconvolution revealed the existence
of −C=C–/–C–C–/(285.2 eV),
−C–O–/–C–N– (285.5 eV),
and C=N (286.5 eV).43Figure 4 shows the XPS spectrum of
xerogel of GL-AgNPs and their deconvolution. The deconvolution of
C 1s of GL-AgNPs displayed peaks with binding energies (BEs) of 284.5
and 285.1 eV, which revealed the presence of −C=C–/–C–C–/–C–H
and −C–O–/–C–N– (Figure 4b). The spectrum
of N 1s showed peaks at 399.31 and 400.14, and O 1s displayed peaks
at 532.2 and 532.8 eV (Figure 4c,d). The XPS spectra of Ag 3d showed two XPS signals at BEs
of 368.3 and 374.1 eV with the separation of 6.0 eV corresponding
to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 BE of Ag0, respectively (Figure 4e).46,47

The viscoelastic behavior and flow characteristics of the self-assembled
material can be examined by performing rheological studies. In order
to examine the mechanical strength of the GL-AgNP gel, a frequency
sweep experiment was carried out by applying a constant strain of
1% at room temperature with respect to the storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″).
During the entire range of frequency sweep, G′
value was observed to be greater than G″,
which clearly revealed the mechanical strength of the gel that is
strong enough to tolerate the external forces (Figure 5a). The amplitude sweep experiment was performed
to identify the critical strain (γc), the point up
to which the self-assembled material tends to retain its structural
integrity by exhibiting solid-like behavior and displays liquid-like
behavior thereafter. The value of γc at which G′ equals G″ was found to
be 11.86% (G′ = G″
= 514.03 Pa) (Figure 5b).

(a) Frequency sweep, (b) amplitude sweep, (c,d) step strain and continuous
temperature ramp-up and ramp-down experiments, respectively. In the
step strain experiment, a high strain of magnitude 100% (red line)
and a low strain of magnitude 0.1% (blue line) were applied alternatively.
Temperature ramp-up and ramp-down experiments for the gel is 25 to
45 °C (red line) and 45 to 25 °C (blue line).

A gel is said to exhibit thixotropic behavior when it is
capable
of regenerating its gel network structure in the step strain experiment.
During this experiment, the value of G′ and G″ was found to decrease on applying a high magnitude
of strain (100%), indicating the breaking of the gel network structure,
and when the strain was reduced to 0.1%, recovery of G′ and G″ was observed signifying the
regeneration of the gel (Figure 5c). Continuous temperature ramp-up and ramp-down experiments
clearly show the thermal processability of the GL-AgNP gel (Figure 5d).

After establishing
the mechanical stability and processability
of the GL-AgNP gel, we were curious to probe the surface of GL-AgNP-coated
fabric. As per the mechanism proposed, after interaction of GL-AgNPs
with the cellulose of cotton fabric via H-bonding, the fabric surface
should display hydrophobicity. The wettability of the coated cloth
surface was probed by measuring the contact angle at an ambient temperature
using a goniometer. When a double-distilled water droplet was placed
on the pristine cotton fabric, immediate absorption of water was observed,
whereas for the fabric coated with GL-AgNPs, GL-CuNPs, and GL-ZnNPs,
the static contact angles of 114.1, 125.4, and 136.0°, respectively,
were observed, which indicate the hydrophobic nature of the coated
surface irrespective of the metal ions used (Figure 6).

2.2 Gas-Sensing Characteristics
2.2.1 Selectivity
A pure cotton cellulose
with yarn warp and weft count of 20.3 × 15.3 picks per inch was
procured from the Department of Textile and Fibre Engineering, Indian
Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi. The cotton fabric was used
as a sensing substrate for fabricating the flexible gas sensor toward
the detection of TMA. Prior to the fabrication process, the cotton
substrates were pretreated with sodium hydroxide solution in order
to remove impurities such as wax, grease, and other noncellulosic
compounds. Because sensitivity, selectivity, and stability are the
key parameters to be considered while fabricating a sensor, the same
parameters have been investigated and reported. Selectivities of GLNPs,
GL-ZnNPs, GL-CuNPs, and GL-AgNPs surface-modified cotton fabrics were
studied toward 100 ppm of ammonia (NH3), formaldehyde (CH2O), TMA, ethanol (C2H5OH), acetaldehyde
(C2H4O), methanol (CH3OH), and isopropanol
(C3H8O) vapors at room temperature and are shown
in Figure 7a. All GL-NP-modified
cotton fabrics showed higher selectivity toward TMA with the incorporation
of different metal ions on the GL-NP sensing element. The architecture
of the sensing element is shown in Figure 7b. The response value of the sensing element
is calculated using eq 1, 1  where Ra and Rg are the resistances
of the surface-modified
cotton fabric in an ambient air atmosphere and target gas atmosphere,
respectively. Response/recovery time (τres/τrec) is defined as the time taken by the sensing element to
attain 90% of change in the total surface resistance.

Figure 7 (a) Selectivity of surface-modified
cotton fabrics with GLNPs,
GL-ZnNPs, GL-CuNPs, and GL-AgNPs toward 100 ppm of ammonia, formaldehyde,
TMA, ethanol, acetaldehyde, methanol, and isopropanol vapors; (b)
gas sensor device architecture diagram with cross-section and dimensions.

The selective response toward TMA might be due
to the lower ionization
energy and lower dipole moment than the other target analytes as given
in the following order:48 C3H9N < C3H8O < NH3 < C2H4O < C2H5OH < CH3OH < CH2O. Also, C3H9N (TMA) has stronger interaction with the sensing element
than other targeted analytes because of its lower bond dissociation
energy in comparison with other target analytes. In comparison, incorporation
of the Ag metal complex with GLNPs showed a maximum sensing response
of 1908 toward TMA. Because of the interaction of TMA with the GL-AgNPs-modified
fabric through donation of 21 electrons by the amine groups to the
chemisorbed oxygen species (eq 4), a greater change resulted in the surface resistance. Moreover,
the sensing response of GLNPs (86), GL-ZnNPs (125), and GL-CuNPs (169)
toward TMA was comparatively lower than that of GL-AgNPs-modified
cotton fabric (1908). The incorporation of metal ions such as Ag,
Cu, and Zn on GLNPs lead to the formation of covalent bonds with the
amide group of glycolipids and resulted in the donation of electrons
because of its hyperelectronic behavioral elements.49 Also, the enhanced surface conductivity of GL-AgNPs surface-modified
cotton fabric compared to that of other metal compound-modified fabric
might have resulted in increased sensing response toward TMA. In addition,
incorporation of Ag metal on GLNPs provides a significant electron-transfer
mechanism between the cations present in the glycolipid compound as
Ag ↔ Ag+. The transient responses of surface-modified
cotton fabrics with GLNPs, GL-ZnNPs, GL-CuNPs, and GL-AgNPs toward
100 ppm of TMA are shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Transient responses of cotton fabrics modified with GLNPs,
GL-ZnNPs,
GL-CuNPs, and GL-AgNPs toward 100 ppm of TMA.

2.3 Gas-Sensing Mechanism
The sensing
mechanism of the surface-modified cotton fabrics is based on the change
in the chemi-resistance of the sensing element in the presence and
absence of target vapors enabled by the electron-transfer dynamics
during gas–solid adsorption/desorption processes. When the
sensing element is exposed to ambient air atmosphere, oxygen molecules
consume the electrons from the conduction band of the n-type semiconducting
GL-AgNP sensing element. This adsorption reaction leads to the formation
of O2– ions on the surface of the modified
fabric, which in turn increases the surface resistance of the sensing
element. The steady-state surface resistance was fixed as the baseline
resistance (Ra). When the sensing element
was exposed to the reducing type TMA, the interaction leads to desorption
of oxygen ions from the sensing element enabled by the release of
electrons from TMA. This process resulted in the increased charge
carrier concentration, which in turn reduced the surface resistance.
The steady-state surface resistance in the presence of target vapor
was recorded as Rg. When the target vapor
was released, the surface resistance again increased to the baseline
value because of desorption of target vapor. The reaction mechanism
is depicted in Figure 9. The response and recovery times of the GL-AgNP surface-modified
cotton fabrics toward 100 ppm of TMA were found to be 114 and 66 s,
respectively. The solid/vapor interaction scheme is given in eqs 2–448 2   3   4  

Figure 9 Schematic
representation of the sensing mechanism of GL-AgNPs-modified
cotton fabric in the presence of TMA vapor.

The transient response for 1–500 ppm of TMA of the GL-AgNPs
surface-modified cotton fabric is shown in Figure 10a. The sensor response increased with the
concentration of TMA and reached the maximum response of 2132 when
the GL-AgNPs sensing element was exposed to 500 ppm. Figure 10b shows the response trend
and linearity range of the GL-AgNPs surface-modified cotton fabric.
Stability is one of the essential parameters for the gas sensor, and
the response toward 100 ppm of TMA for 15 days is shown in Figure 11.

3 Conclusions
Biosphere faces serious threat
with the emission of VOCs into the
atmosphere from industries, solvent evaporation, petroleum products,
and other human activities. Numerous health hazards occurring with
the VOC emission have created the need for the VOC sensor development.
In particular, TMA is one of the VOCs that causes various health hazards
including “trimethylaminuria” or “fish odor syndrome.”
Hence, there is a huge demand in the development of a new sensor material
for TMA detection for use in food-processing industries, medical diagnosis,
and environment. In this regard, for the first time, we have reported
the formation of self-assembled silver-, copper-, and zinc-incorporated
glycolipids, namely, GL-AgNPs, GL-CuNPs, and GL-ZnNPs by adding a
solution of corresponding metal ions on to the gel formed by glycolipid 3 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene, which displays morphological transition
from chiral helical tubules to fibrillar architecture without changing
the phase. Morphological analysis of GL-NPs showed a 3D fibrous structure,
which confirms the morphological transition in the gel induced by
the interaction of metal ions with the coordination site of chiral
helical tubules obtained from glycolipid 3. The self-assembled
silver-incorporated glycolipid further interacts with the cellulose
of cotton fabric via H-bonding, resulting in the formation of hydrophobic
fabric with a conducting property. The developed GL-AgNP-based fabric
displayed a transient response for 1–500 ppm of TMA and a stable
response toward 100 ppm of TMA for 15 days. The reported protocol
based on the self-assembly process may open new avenues in sensor
science. GL-AgNP-based flexible TMA sensor fabrics developed via the
sequential self-assembly process hold great promise for various innovative
applications in environmental science, healthcare, medicine, and biology.
From the commercial point of view, GL-AgNP-based flexible fabrics
shall be encapsulated in porous thermoplastic films such as Platilon
U and Zitex G-104 without affecting the sensing performances such
as selectivity, sensitivity, durability, and lifetime of the sensor.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
Reagents and
solvents required for the synthesis of GL and GL-NPs were purchased
from Alfa Aesar, Avra, Merck, SRL, TCI chemicals, and Sigma-Aldrich
and used as such without any further purification. Compounds were
purified using LR grade solvents, and distilled solvents were used
when considered necessary. The progress of the reaction was monitored
using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on the 60G F254 precoated
silica gel plates procured from Merck and visualized with the help
of ultraviolet light or sulfuric acid spray or molecular iodine or p-anisaldehyde stain. 1H- and 13C-NMR
spectra for the glycolipid were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 300 MHz
spectrometer at room temperature in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported with respect
to the internal standard, tetramethylsilane, in parts per million
(ppm), and coupling constants (J) are given in Hz.
Proton multiplicity is assigned using the following abbreviations:
singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), and multiplet
(m). Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectra of the cotton fabric,
fabric coated with GL, and GL-NPs were recorded in the attenuated
total reflectance mode using a PerkinElmer 100 FTIR spectrometer in
the spectral range of 4000–500 cm–1. Field
emission scanning electron microscope integrated with an energy-dispersive
X-ray system (JEOL, JSM-6701F, Japan) was used to observe the morphology
of self-assembled GL, cotton fabric, and fabric coated with GL and
GL-AgNPs. An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., K-Alpha, USA) was used to record the XPS spectra of GL-AgNPs
and were compared with those in our previously reported literature.
XRD of GL-AgNPs, fabric, and fabric with GL-AgNPs was performed on
a BRUKER-binary V3 diffractometer system, and the results were compared
with native self-assembled GL.

4.2 Synthesis
4.2.1 General Procedure for the Synthesis of Glycolipid
GL 3
Glycolipid GL 3 was synthesized
from gluconolactone, hydrazine hydrate, and 2-hydroxy-4-pentadecylbenzaldehyde
by following the procedure reported in the literature.43 To a solution of gluconolactone (1.0 mmol) in
ethanol, hydrazine hydrate (1.5 mmol) was added and refluxed for 30
min to form gluconolactone hydrazide. To the refluxed mixture, 2-hydroxy-4-pentadecylbenzaldehyde
(1.0 mmol) was added and further refluxed for 90 min to produce glycolipid 3. After completion of the reaction, as identified by TLC,
the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. Upon cooling
the reaction mixture, solid glycolipid 3 was precipitated,
which was further filtered, washed well with cold ethanol, and air
dried.

4.3 Preparation of Self-Assembled
GL, GL-NPs,
and GL-NP-Coated Cotton Fabric Material
A mixture of 1 mg
of glycolipid, GL 3, and 1 mL of dichlorobenzene (1 mL)
was taken in a glass vial and heated until the solid was completely
dissolved. Upon cooling to room temperature, organogel formation was
observed and confirmed by the “inversion of test tube”
method. Further, self-assembled GL-AgNPs 4a, GL-CuNPs 4b, and GL-ZnNPs 4c, generally referred as GL-NPs 4a–c, were prepared by adding a solution of silver
nitrate, copper acetate, and zinc acetate solution separately on to
the gel. A slow percolation of these solutions in the gel matrix was
observed by the change of color from transparent to black, green,
and pale yellow, indicating the formation of self-assembled GL-NPs 4a–c, respectively. Later, the left-over supernatant
solution above the gel surface was decanted, and the sample was dried.
The dried sample was thoroughly washed with aqueous EtOH (1:1 v/v),
dried under vacuum, and stored in a desiccator for further studies.
Self-assembled GL-NPs 4a–c were coated on cotton
by adopting the following procedure: Dried 10 mg of GL-NPs 4a–c were completely dispersed in 25 mL of dichlorobenzene taken in a
beaker by sonication for 10 min, followed by the immersion of a 5
× 5 cm cotton fabric with the help of a hanging clip, and left
undisturbed for 24 h. After immersion, the fabric was removed and
air dried for 48 h in a closed container for further studies. Our
preliminary studies on the conductivity of self-assembled GL-AgNPs 4a, GL-CuNPs 4b, and GL-ZnNPs 4c revealed that self-assembled GL-AgNPs 4a are more promising
and hence are further used for our investigation.

4.4 Rheological Analysis
The viscoelastic
behavior, mechanical strength, thixotropic behavior, and processability
of GL-AgNPs in gel form was investigated with a stress-controlled
rheometer (Anton Paar 302 rheometer) equipped with steel-coated parallel-plate
geometry (25 mm diameter). During the rheological analysis, the measurements
were recorded by fixing a 1 mm gap between two parallel plates. Initially,
linear viscoelastic range was obtained by performing the amplitude
sweep measurement, which is directly proportional to the mechanical
strength of the GL-AgNP gel sample. Then, frequency sweep was performed
to examine the storage modulus G′ and the
loss modulus G″ as functions of frequency
sweep from 0.1 to 300 rad s–1.

4.5 Contact Angle Measurements
The hydrophobicity
of fabric samples was investigated by contact angle measurements using
a goniometer. The contact angle values reported are averages of three
measurements made on different areas of the fabric surface.

4.6 Sensor Measurements
Sensing characteristics
were investigated using a homemade chemical/gas testing chamber44 integrated with a high-resistance electrometer
(Keithley 6517 B, USA).
