The
delicate flow-induced morphology of immiscible polypropylene/polystyrene
blends in the presence of silica nanoparticles (NPs) is investigated
in a multiparameter space. The morphology map constructed based on
in situ morphology observation reveals that a critical ratio of NP
concentration to droplet concentration, which strongly depends on
the NP surface chemistries and the ratio of the NP concentration to
the droplet concentration, exists. Below or above the critical ratio,
the NPs display diverse effects on the morphology (promote or suppress
droplet coalescence). These results can be interpreted by the competition
between the bridging mechanism (acceleratory effect) and the enhanced
viscoelasticity (inhibitory effect) exerted by the NPs.

Introduction
Inorganic nanoparticles
(NPs) have been purposefully used as modifiers
to improve the mechanical, barrier, and thermal properties of immiscible
polymer blends because it is low-cost in industrial application.1−3 The properties of filled blends depend largely on the final morphology
generated during the structure evolution, such as the coalescence
and breakup behavior of droplets, experienced during melt processing.4−9 Most of available researches focus on the final morphology and properties
of ternary immiscible blends,10−26 but it is still arguable how NPs affect the dynamics of morphology
evolution during flow (processing).27−32

In ternary particle/liquid/liquid mixtures, such as Pickering
emulsions,10−12 bijels,13−15 and “dry liquids”,16,17 the morphology evolution is found to mainly depend on the surface
chemistries of particles, the wettability of particles and components,
the loadings of particles, and the blend ratio. For example, Velankar
et al.18−21 in detail investigated how these factors simultaneously affect the
morphology of ternary mixtures. Specifically, in interfacially active
particle-filled polyethylene oxide (PEO)/polyisobutylene (PIB) blends
with a droplet/matrix morphology, the size of the dispersed phase
can be increased and reduced at low (∼0.1 vol %) and high (∼1
vol %) volume fractions of particles through promoting the flow-induced
coalescence and completely covering the interface, respectively; however,
when particles are preferentially wetted by the continuous phase,
the morphology consists of clusters of particle-bridged drops.20 When particles are almost completely wetted
by one of the polymer phases, increasing the wetting fluid loading
induces a morphological transition from a pendular network to compact
capillary aggregates network, with an intermediate funicular state.21 Moreover, a composition-morphology map is constructed
in PIB/PEO/particle blends, which reveals that particles affect the
morphology greatly when the dispersed phase (PEO) is preferred by
the particles.23

However, until now,
there is yet no scientific consensus on how
NPs affect the morphology evolution of blends in flow, and increasing
research is dedicating to gain more insights into the morphology and
properties of NP-filled blends. For instance, in the polypropylene
(PP)/polystyrene (PS) 70/30 blend,33 the
morphology is significantly refined both by 3 wt % hydrophobic silica
located at the interface becuase of the inhibited coalescence of the
PS dispersed phase and by 3 wt % hydrophilic silica confined in PS
phase owing to the reduced interfacial tension. However, our previous
work34 stated that the morphology became
coarsened in the PS/polyamide 6 (PA6) 80/20 blend with a selective
distribution of hydrophilic silica (3 and 5 vol %) in PA6-dispersed
phase during slow shear flow. From all above research, one can see
that most of available researches are focused on the impacts of only
a single factor on the morphology evolution and properties of filled
blends in flow, such as one given loading of NPs, a given blend composition
ratio and so on.21,33,34 There is a lack of clear understanding of how combinations of these
influence factors affect the formation and dynamics of morphology
in immiscible polymer blends under shear flow. This limits greatly
the applications of NPs in structuring and compatibilizing polymer
blends. Present work shows that NPs not only can refine and stabilize
the blend morphology (droplet/matrix or co-continuous structure) because
of reduced interfacial tension and/or the steric effect10,33,35 but also can make the morphology
coarsened by increasing the viscosity and/or via a bridging-dewetting
mechanism.20,34 However, a detailed state diagram
describing the dependence of morphology of NP-filled blends on the
blend ratio, and surface nature and loadings of NPs, which would be
helpful in the application of NPs in structuring polymer blends, has
not been constructed.

This work aims to provide a more comprehensive
insight into the
effect of NPs on the coalescence/breakup behavior of droplets in slow
shear flow in a multiparameter space (such as the surface nature and
concentration of NPs, and blend ratios) through an in situ flow-visualization
technique. A morphology map is constructed to unravel the rule of
thumb between the flow-induced morphology and material parameters.

Result
and Discussion
Distribution of NPs in Blends
The
distribution of A200
and R974 silica NPs in filled PP/PS blends is characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Figure 1a,c reveals that most of A200 NPs disperse
exclusively in the PS phase and a small portion of them locate at
the interface of PS and PP (as shown by red arrows). Diversely, although
lots of R974 NPs locate within the PS phase, they are closer to the
interface between PP and PS (Figure 1b,d). This agrees well with the distribution of NPs
in blends predicted by the wetting parameter (ω12). The ω12 is defined as ω12 =
(γSi-2 – γSi-1)/γ12 (where γSi-i is the interfacial tension between the silica NP and the polymer i and γ12 is the interfacial tension between
the two polymers). When ω12 > 1 (ω12 < −1), silica NPs are present only in polymer 1 (polymer
2). For −1 < ω12 < 1, the NPs should
be located at the interface between the two polymers. Then, ω12 was calculated to be 4.93 and 2.19 for A200- and R974-filled
PP/PS blends, respectively, where the details of this calculation
are given in our previous papers.36,37 This indicates
that A200 NPs mainly disperse in PS phase while R974 NPs also locate
in PS phase but are closer to the interface, which agrees the TEM
results.

NPs in PS-minor (PS20) blends and 1 wt % A200 (c) and R974 (d) NPs
in PP-minor (PP20) blends. The scale bars in images a–d denote
100 nm, 0.2 μm, 0.5 μm, and 0.5 μm, respectively.

Morphology of NP-Filled
Blends
First, the initial morphology
of all as-prepared PS/PP blends is investigated, as shown in Figures
S1–4 (see in the Supporting Information). For all as-prepared PS-minor blends, a typical droplet/matrix
structure is found. However, the near-spherical PS droplets get refined
with increasing NP concentration, regardless of the hydrophilic (A200)
or hydrophobic (R974) nature of NPs (Figures S1 and 2). For all as-prepared PP-minor blends, the morphology
becomes coarsened with increasing concentration of hydrophilic (A200)
NPs (Figure S3) while it becomes refined
with increasing the concentrations of hydrophobic (R974) NPs (Figure S4). Moreover, the rheological properties
for all as-prepared PP/PS blends are shown in Figures S5 and S6. The storage moduli and complex viscosities
for all samples are shown to increase with the NP concentration, especially
when the NP concentration exceeds 3 wt %. In addition, for a given
NP concentration, viscoelasticity of hydrophilic NP-filled blends
is much higher than that of hydrophobic filled ones.

Then, the
morphology of NP-filled blends is investigated after shearing at 0.1
s–1 for 7000 s, as shown in the Figures 2, 3 and S7–10. It is found that for
NPs with a particular surface nature, the influence of NPs on the
in situ morphology under flow depends largely both on the relative
content of NPs and on the blend ratio. For example, in the PS/PP 5/95
(PS5) blend (PS-minor blend, Figure 2a), the PS droplet phase displays a typical ellipsoidal
shape with a number-averaged size (Dn)
of ∼8.2 μm and orients along the flow direction. In the
PS5 blend with ϕA200 = 1 wt % (Figure 2b), coarsened and irregular PS droplets (∼10–20
μm) are present. However, adding more A200 NPs refines the morphology.
The Dn of PS droplets declines to 4.8
and 3.6 μm for PS5-A3 and -A5 blends (Figure 2c,d), respectively. These results indicate
that A200 NPs demonstrate distinct diverse influences (promotion or
inhibition) on the morphology of PS-minor blends below or above a
critical NP concentration (ϕcrit). Increasing the
concentration of PS phase makes the A200 NP-promoted coalescence more
noticeable but a higher ϕcrit is required for observing
the refinement effect of NPs. As shown in Figure 2e–h and 2i–l,
the ϕcrit of A200 NPs increases to ∼2 and
∼4 wt % for the PS/PP 10/90 (PS10) and 20/80 (PS20) blends,
respectively (PS-minor blends filled with more different concentrations
of A200 NPs are shown in the Figure S7).
Therefore, the microstructure of A200-filled PS-minor blends under
flow is closely related to both ϕA200 and ϕPS.

of shear flow.

bar denotes 50 μm. The red arrow represents the direction of
shear flow.

Different from the peculiar
morphology evolution in PS-minor blend,
ellipsoidal, and fibrillar PP droplets always form in PP-minor blends
upon introducing A200 NPs (Figure S8).
Increasing ϕPP will increase the number of fibrillar
droplets while increasing ϕA200 will make most of
PP droplets fibrillar and larger (Figure S8c,d,g,h,k,l). Dense fibrillar PP droplets with a radial size of 10–15
μm and length beyond 250 μm are observed in the PP10-A5
blend (Figure S8h) and with radial size
up to 60 μm appear in the PP20-A5 blend (Figure S8l).

For hydrophobic NP (R974)-filled PS minor
blends, the morphology
also strongly depends on the relative content of R974 NPs (ϕR974) and PS dispersed phase (ϕPS). As the
ϕR974 and ϕPS vary, either refined
or coarsened PS droplets are observed, as shown in Figure 3 (PS-minor blends filled with
more different concentrations are shown in the Figure S9). For example, for R974-filled PS5 blends, with
increasing ϕR974, the PS droplets first get coarsened
and then refined (Figure 3a–d), demonstrating a critical ϕR974 of about 1.5 wt % (Figure S9a–f). As the ϕPS increases to 10% (Figure 3e–h) and 20% (Figure 3i–l), the
critical ϕR974 increases to 3 wt % (Figure S9g–l) and 6 wt % (Figure S9m–r), respectively. Differently, in R974-filled PP-minor
blends, PP droplets are refined remarkably at ϕR974 = 1 wt % (reducedto 25, 32, and 56% of their initial droplet size,
as shown in Figures S10 and S11) and then
are refined with further increasing ϕR974 (Figures S10 and S11). Therefore, 1 wt % R974
NPs can be defined as critical ϕR974 which is similar
to the critical micelle concentration of copolymer in compatibilized
blends.38

State Map and Mechanism
On the basis of the above results,
the morphology evolution of NP-filled PP/PS blends is diagrammed in Figure 4 in a multiple parameter
space consisting of the blend ratio (ϕPS), NP loading
and surface nature (ϕA200 or ϕR974). Obviously, for A200-filled PS minor blends, the role of NPs on
the phase structure at low ϕPS and ϕA200 is opposite to the case with high ϕPS and ϕA200, suggesting the existence of a critical ratio of NP to
droplet concentration (red dash line in Figure 4a). On this critical line, the critical ratio
(ϕA200/ϕPS) of ϕA200 to ϕPS equals ∼0.2. Below this line (namely,
ϕA200/ϕPS < ∼0.2), A200
NPs coarsen droplets and above this line A200 NPs refine droplets.
As shown in Figure 4b, a similar critical rule can also be found when adding R974 NPs
into PS-minor blends. However, the critical ratio (ϕR974/ϕPS) increases to ∼0.3, below which coarsened
PS droplets are present while above which the morphology becomes refined.

(5, 10, 20, 80, 90, and 95 wt % PS droplets) with different loadings
of hydrophilic A200 (a) and hydrophobic R974 NPs (b) after shearing
at 0.1 s–1 and 200 °C for 7000 s. The red arrows
represent the flow direction.

The delicate effect of NPs on the ϕNPs/ϕdrop ratio is believed to be closely related to the changes
in the interfacial and viscoelastic properties of blends induced by
the distribution of NPs. The TEM images in Figure 1 reveal that most of A200 NPs disperse exclusively
in the PS phase and a small portion of them locate at the interface
of PS and PP. Diversely, although lots of R974 NPs locate within the
PS phase, they are closer to the interface between PP and PS. As most
of NPs selectively disperse in the PS phase, the viscoelasticity of
corresponding PS/A200 and PS/R974 composites is enhanced accordingly
with increasing ϕNP (ϕA200 or ϕR974) as shown in Figure 5, especially for PS/A200 composites at low frequencies.
For PS-minor blends, A200 NPs locate mainly within the PS droplets,
as shown in the TEM image in Figure 1a. When ϕA200/ϕPS is below the critical value (∼0.2), only a small portion
of A200 NPs locate at the interface of PS droplets and PP matrix,
which cannot fully cover the surface of PS droplets (as shown by red
arrows in Figure 1a).
Therefore, when two filled PS droplets collide during shearing, A200
NPs on the surface of one PS droplet may stick onto the uncovered
surface of the other PS droplet (Figure 6a,b) and tend to make droplets coalesce.
However, the interface relaxation of these coalescing droplets is
significantly suppressed due to the enhanced viscoelasticity of filled
PS droplets (Figure 5a,b). As a result, large irregular PS droplets which cannot relax
into ellipsoidal or spherical droplets are formed. A similar phenomenon
was also found in the PA6/PS (20/80) blend with A200 NPs selectively
filling in PA6 phases.34 When ϕA200/ϕPS is above the critical value (∼0.2),
A200 NPs tend to form aggregates and networks within PS droplets which
greatly enhance the viscoelasticity of droplets (Figure 5a,b), leading to much longer
coalescence time.39 Besides, more A200
NPs will locate at the surface of PS droplets. Both will make droplets
more rigid and prevent the effective coalescence upon collision (Figure 6c). As a result,
significantly refined morphology is observed in blends with high ϕA200 (Figure 2c,d,g,h,l).

are mixed with 1, 3, and 5 wt % NPs, correspondingly PS phase is filled
with 1.25, 3.75, and 6.25 wt % NPs.

in A200-filled PS-minor (a,c) and PP-minor (d,f) blends. The red arrow
indicates the flow direction.

Differently, in R974-filled PS-minor blends, R974 NPs locate
within
PS droplets but are more close to the blend interface (Figure 1b). Below the critical ϕR974/ϕPS (∼0.3), the NPs on the partially
covered PS droplets enable the “bridging-dewetting”
mechanism40 to work. As shown in Figure 7, when one PS droplet
is in close proximity to another droplet, surface is not protected
by NPs, and in slow flow, the edge of the bridged layer ruptures,
allowing coalescence to proceed (Figure 7b). Then, bridged and coarsened PS droplets
form. A similar phenomenon was found in the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/polyisoprene
blends filled with fluoropolymer particles and iron oxyhydroxide particles,
which suggested that interactively particles play the role of “bridging-dewetting”
in droplet coalescence.40 However, when
ϕR974/ϕPS is above the critical
value (∼0.3), PS droplets are highly filled with R974 NPs and
more NPs will be forced to locate at the droplet surface (Figure 7c), thereby suppressing
coalescence and refining the morphology.

of flow-induced droplet behaviors
in R974-filled PS-minor (a–c) and PP-minor (d–f) blends.
The red arrow indicates the flow direction.

Different phenomena can be observed if PP is the droplet
(minor)
phase. In A200-filled PP-minor blends, most of A200 NPs preferentially
distributed in the PS matrix and a small portion of them are close
to the interface between PP and PS (Figure 1c) and the promoted coalescence observed
at low ϕA200/ϕPP value can be understood
schematically by Figure 6d–f. In this case, when two droplets are held in close proximity,
A200 NPs located in the PS matrix between two PP droplets are able
to glue two PP droplets together by bridging across them (Figure 6d). Then, the free
surfaces of two droplets near to the connecting A200 NPs may have
enough times to contact each other under flow and thus allow coalescence
to proceed (Figure 6e).20 Finally, coalesced PP droplets deform
into fibrillar droplets in slow flow (Figure 6f). This promoted fibrillar droplets can
be attributed to the enhanced viscoelasticity of PS matrix because
of the selective distribution of A200 NPs in the PS matrix.41 A similar phenomenon has been reported in ternary
PEO/PIB/silica systems because of the preferential wetting of silica
particles by the PIB matrix,20 and in PDMS/PIB
90/10 blends with A200 NPs selectively filling in the PDMS matrix.42

In R974-filled PP-minor blends, R974 NPs
locate within the PS matrix
and form a layer at the blend interface (Figure 1d). As shown in Figure 4b, the PP droplets are gradually refined
with increasing ϕR974, regardless of the ϕPP (Figure S10). The refined PP
droplet size can be ascribed to the prevented coalescence of PP droplets
by the formation of R974 NP layer in PS matrix close to the interface
of blends (Figures 1d and 7e,f).33 With
further increasing ϕR974, the PP droplet size changes
little.

Overall, in PS-minor blends, if most of A200 NPs disperse
exclusively
in PS droplets and a small portion of them locate at the interface
between PS droplet and PP matrix (Figure 1a), the PS droplets become coarsened below
the critical ϕA200/ϕPS (∼0.2)
and the coalescence of droplets is suppressed above the critical value.
If lots of R974 NPs locate within PS droplets and are close to the
interface between PS droplet and PP matrix (Figure 1b), the coalescence of PS droplets is promoted
below the critical ϕR974/ϕPS (∼0.3)
and suppressed above the critical value. Here, below the critical
ϕNPs/ϕdrop, the coarsened morphology
agrees well with the reports that if the particles are located on
the interface but wetting the droplet polymer, bridges can also form
but not so stable that coalescence may happen.40 In PP-minor blends, if most of A200 NPs disperse exclusively
in PS matrix and a small portion of them locate at the interface between
PP droplet and PS matrix (Figure 1c), the formation of fibrillar PP droplets are promoted.
If lots of R974 NPs locate within the PS matrix and are close to the
interface between PP droplet and PS matrix (Figure 1d), PP droplets are refined. Here, the morphology
of R974-filled PP minor blends agrees well with the reports that if
the particles are located on the interface and wetting the continuous
polymer, particles can stabilize the droplets24 and even act as bridge to form stable droplet clusters.25,26 However, the morphology of A200-filled PP minor blends differs.
Most A200 NPs distributed in matrix and a small portion of A200 NPs
located at the interface lead to the destabilization of the droplets
under flow.

Conclusions
In summary, the morphology
evolution in silica NP-filled PP/PS
blends under slow flow strongly depends on the surface chemistry and
loading of NPs (ϕNP) and weight fraction of droplets
(ϕdrop). When NPs tend to locate in droplets, or
are close to the interface and in droplets, the morphology evolution
of filled blends exhibits a critical rule related to ϕNP/ϕdrop. Below the critical ϕNP/ϕdrop, NP-induced bridging and droplet coalescence is dominated,
resulting in coarsened and irregular droplets. However, beyond the
critical ϕNP/ϕdrop, the droplet
coalescence can be suppressed because of enhanced viscoelasticity,
and droplets are refined effectively. This critical ϕNP/ϕdrop is found to change with the surface chemistry
and distribution of NPs, and is ∼0.2 for hydrophilic NPs and
∼0.3 for hydrophobic NPs. Such a critical rule is not found
when NPs disperse in the matrix or are close to the interface and
in the matrix. Fibrillar droplets are formed when hydrophilic NPs
located in the matrix and refined droplets are formed when hydrophobic
NPs dispersed interfacially.

Experimental Section
Materials
PP (T30S)
was provided by Lanzhou petrochemical
Co. Ltd., and had a melt flow index (MFI) of 2.6 g/10 min (190 °C,
2.16 kg) and density of 0.91 g/cm3. PS (GP5250) was supplied
by Taihua Plastic (Ningbo) Co., Ltd. and had a MFI of 7.0 g/10 min
(200 °C, 5 kg) and density of 1.05 g/cm3. Fumed hydrophilic
silica (Aerosil A200) and hydrophobic silica (Aerosil R974) were supplied
by Degussa Corp. Both types of silica NPs (SiO2) had an
average primary diameter of 12 nm, and the specific surface area of
200 ± 25 and 170 ± 20 m2/g, respectively. Anti-oxidant
1010 (pentaerythritol tetrakis [3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)
propionate], purity > 95.0%) provided by Wuhan Petrochemical Company,
China, was used to prevent the degradation of PP during blending and
experiments. Prior to melt blending, the pellets of components were
dried in vacuum at 70 °C for 24 h.

Sample Preparation
All samples were blended with using
an internal mixer (XSS-300, Kechuang, China). The mixing chamber was
filled with 42 cm3 of materials. The screw speed was 50
rpm. For all blends, three components, hydrophilic/hydrophobic silica,
PS, and PP, with 0.1% anti-oxidant 1010, were loaded to the mixing
chamber simultaneously and compounded at 200 °C for 10 min (after
blending for 10 min, the torque was stable for all samples). Various
loadings (0–5 wt %) of hydrophilic (A200, Degussa) and hydrophobic
(R974, Degussa) fumed silica NPs (ϕA200 or ϕR974) are incorporated in PP/PS blends with different blend
ratios (5–20 wt % of PP or PS droplets, ϕPP or ϕPS). Here, NP-filled PP/PS blends are designated
as DC-NL blends for brevity, where D denotes the dispersed phase,
C represents the concentration of the dispersed phase, N delegates
the types of silica NPs, and L stands for the loading of silica NPs
in the blend. Taking PP5-A1 and PP5-R1 blends for example, it signifies
the PP/PS 5/95 blend filled with 1 wt % A200 and R974 NPs, respectively.
The mixed blends were then compression-molded in vacuum at 200 °C
for 5 min into disk-like samples with a diameter of 25 mm and a thickness
of 1.5 mm. In addition, the PS/SiO2 composites were prepared
to investigate the changes of viscoelasticity induced by the selective
distribution of silica NPs with different surface chemistries. All
samples were kept in vacuum at 70 °C for characteristics.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy
A field-emission TEM
(Tecnai G2 F20) equipment was utilized to verify the location of A200
and R974 NPs in filled blends. Cross sections of pressed blends were
obtained by slicing the sample into thin films of about 80–100
nm thicknesses via a Leica EMUC6/FC6 microtome and then were stained
by OsO4 vapor for 8 h. The dispersion of NPs was then observed
by using TEM at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.

Rheology Measurements
Rheological properties of the
components and blends were measured using a strain-controlled rheometer
(ARES, TA instruments, USA) with a parallel plate geometry of 25 mm
in diameter. Linear viscoelastic measurements of the composites were
conducted at 200 °C under nitrogen atmosphere to prevent thermo-oxidative
degradation. The shear strain amplitude is 2%, which was found to
be within the linear viscoelastic regime, and the range of the frequency
is from 100 to 0.02 rad/s.

Morphology Observation
The morphological
evolution
of PP/PS/SiO2 blends in shear flow was visualized in a
counter-rotating shear cell (CSS450, Linkam Scientific Instruments
Ltd., UK) consisting of two quartz parallel disks, which was mounted
on an optical microscope (Olympus BX51, Japan). The sample was loaded
into the shearing stage, and then the temperature was elevated to
200 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min. The real-time observation
of morphological evolution during shear flow was carried out at a
gap width of 100 μm. Before each test, the gap width was referenced
by focusing two lines on the two plates and ensured the deviation
within ±5 μm. First, before the observation, the sample
was shearing at 20 s–1 for 300 s to avoid the flow
history effect produced by sample loading. Then, flow-induced droplet
coalescence behavior in the presence of NPs was investigated at a
low shear rate of 0.1 s–1 for 7000 s (At 0.1 s–1 and 200 °C, the viscosity of PP and PS is 5600
and 5100 Pa·s, respectively). After this period of shearing,
the morphology for all samples is stable over time. The morphological
evolutions of blends during shear were recorded every 10 s with a
Linksys32 DV image acquisition system and were analyzed using a home-developed
digital image analysis software package. It is noted that the optical
micrographs of the flow-induced morphology shown in the paper were
taken after the flow momentarily stopped. The number averaged diameter
(Dn) was calculated according to 1  where N is the number of
droplets and Di is the
droplet diameter. Approximately 300 droplets were measured for each
blend.
