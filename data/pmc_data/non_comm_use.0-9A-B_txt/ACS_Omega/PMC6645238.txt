An
efficient synthesis of dimethyl tripartin as a synthetic precursor
of natural product tripartin, the first natural specific inhibitor
of histone H3 lysine 9 demethylase KDM4, is described. The synthesis
of dimethyl tripartin was achieved in a six-step longest linear sequence
starting from commercially available 3,5-dimethoxy benzaldehyde with
21% overall yield, using ClTi(OiPr)3-mediated dichloromethine insertion as the key step.

Introduction
Tripartin (1), a dichlorinated indanone natural product,
was isolated in 2013 by Oh group from the culture broth of the Streptomyces sp. associated with larvae of the dung
beetle Copris tripartitus Waterhouse.1 It has a tertiary hydroxyl group and a dichloromethine
group attached to the C-3 position. In fact, it is the first ever
indanone system reported to possess such unique dichlorinated functionality.
A total synthesis of tripartin has not been achieved so far (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Tripartin.

Dynamic methylation and demethylation
of arginine and lysine residues
of histone protein is a very important biological phenomenon because
methylation of different sites can activate or repress genes and therefore
regulates transcription.2 Methylation of
specific lysine residues is carried out by enzymes known as histone
methyltransferases, while the demethylation is carried out by histone
demethylases (KDMs). Among the KDM subfamily, humans possess KDM2/7,
KDM3, KDM4, KDM5, and KDM6, and these KDMs are often targets for treatment
of diseases like leukemia, breast cancer, prostate cancer,3 and inflammation.4 Tripartin is the first natural specific inhibitor of histone H3
lysine 9 demethylase KDM4. Very few KDM selective inhibitors are reported
in the literature5 and among those the
KDM4 inhibitors are least known, which highlights the unique property
of tripartin.

Results and Discussion
Careful observation
of the structure of tripartin reveals that
it has a very labile moiety at the C-3 position. The site contains
a tertiary hydroxy group which is also a benzylic hydroxy group, making
it very prone toward elimination. Two types of acidic protons one
at α-position of the carbonyl group and another on the dichloromethine
group are adjacent to the hydroxyl group, suggesting that the molecule
might be quite sensitive toward acidic and basic conditions. This
foresight of the problems challenged us to accept the total synthesis
of tripartin. In this communication, we report our efforts toward
the synthesis of tripartin.

The retrosynthetic analysis of tripartin
is shown in Scheme 1. It was envisioned that natural
product tripartin 1 could be obtained from the tertiary
alcohol 2 by successive deprotections of dithiane and
methoxy groups. Compound 2 was planned to be synthesized
from indanone derivative 3 by insertion of the dichloromethine
group. Compound 3 could be accessed from acid 4, which might be easily obtained from commercially available 3,5-dimethoxy
benzaldehyde 5 via 6.

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic Analysis
As shown in Scheme 2, the starting point of our
synthesis was β-keto ester 6 which was prepared
from commercially available 3,5-dimethoxy
benzaldehyde by a known two-step protocol.6 Protection of the ketone group using 1,3-propane dithiol followed
by saponification of ester 8 gave acid 4, which set the stage for Friedel–Crafts intramolecular cyclization.
Several Friedel–Crafts cyclization conditions were employed
such as triflic acid, MeSO3H, Tb(OTf)3, Yb(OTf)3, and AlCl3 to cyclize the acid 4 to
get indanone 3. Unfortunately, all these attempts were
unsuccessful. Interestingly, when the acid chloride 9 was treated with AlCl3, instead of the expected indanone
derivative 3, it generated 8-membered ring compound 10 containing two S atoms from the dithiane moiety.

Scheme 2 Synthesis
of Compound 10
Because the dithiane protecting group was interfering
with the
Friedel–Crafts cyclization, it was decided to use benzyl protection.
Unfortunately, benzyl protection of the secondary alcohol 7 was unsuccessful, under various conditions such as NaH/PhCH2Br/–78 °C, CaSO4/Ag2O/PhCH2Br, and Cl3CC(NH)OCH2Ph/BF3·OEt2, in all of the cases either the starting material
was recovered or the hydroxyl elimination product was obtained.

It was thought that introduction of ketone functionality could
be delayed rather than installing it at the beginning of the synthesis
to avoid the complications. Reaching up to the indanone 12 stage seemed easy this way (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Retrosynthetic Analysis
As anticipated, the indanone 12 was accessed
without
much difficulty starting from 3,5-dimethoxy benzaldehyde 5 using a four-step protocol. Wittig olefination followed by Pd–C
catalyzed reduction furnished required ester 15 in excellent
yield. Saponification of ester 15 by using LiOH provided
acid 13, which was subsequently treated with CH3SO3H to generate required indanone 12 in
85% yield (two steps) (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Compound 12
It was thought that methoxy groups should be
deprotected before
installing the sensitive tert-hydroxyl group and dichloromethine functionality.
Keeping the upcoming sensitive intermediates in mind, deprotection
of the methoxy groups of indanone 12 was planned at this
stage. Accordingly, indanone 12 on treatment with BBr3 afforded dihydroxy indanone derivative 16. Unfortunately
dichloromethine insertion reaction was unsuccessful under basic conditions
as shown in Scheme 5. The failure of this reaction might be due to the phenolic hydroxyl
group, by decreasing the electrophilic character of the ketone group
and rendering it inert toward the nucleophilic attack. Next, the reaction
of indanone 12 with dichloromethine anion generated from
dichloromethane and n-BuLi resulted in formation
of compound 11 in 18% yield. The yield was further improved
to 58% using ClTi(OiPr)3 to
activate the ketone.7

Scheme 5 Synthesis of Compound 11
Compound 11 was found to be very unstable with highly
labile tertiary alcohol moiety which readily underwent aerial oxidation
to generate an epoxide 18 when kept at rt for 6 h. The
structure of this epoxide molecule was further confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray analysis.8 It was also noticed that
the tertiary alcohol 11 undergoes dehydration when stored
in CDCl3 for 5 min (Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Synthesis of Compounds 18 and 19
After having tertiary alcohol 11 in hand, our next
task was benzylic oxidation to install the ketone functionality. Toward
this goal, various known oxidation conditions were screened such as
NaOCl/t-BuOOH, t-BuOOH/MnO2, KMnO4, and t-BuOOH/Mn(OAc)2, but unfortunately, we observed decomposition of the starting material.
Interestingly, compound 11 on treatment with IBX in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) at 80 °C for 12 h afforded compound 20. To our delight, the required keto compound 21 was
obtained by employing a KMnO4/MnO2 reagent combination
in 46% yield (Scheme 7). As anticipated earlier, the deprotection of methoxy groups proved
to be most challenging task at this stage. Various reagents (BBr3, EtSNa, AlCl3, HBr, and dl-methionine/MeSO3H, BCl3) known in the literature for deprotection
of methoxy groups were screened. Decomposition of the starting material
was the common result of all such attempts.

Scheme 7 Synthesis of Compounds 20 and 21
It was envisioned that benzyl protection would be more
suitable
instead of methoxy groups, as it can be removed selectively under
hydrogenation conditions. Accordingly, compound 22 was
obtained by benzyl protection of the 3,5-dihydroxy indanone 16 in 92% yield. When the dibenzylated indanone 22 was subjected to dichloromethine anion generated from dichloromethane
and n-BuLi, the reaction went very smoothly without
any difficulty and afforded compound 23 in 51% yield.
But contrary to our assumption, deprotection of the benzyl groups
was proved to be problematic. Under different types of hydrogenation
conditions such as Pd/C/EtOAc, Pd/C/CH2Cl2,
Pd/C/MeOH, Pd(OH)2/MeOH, and Pd/C/TBAC/EtOAc, all chlorine
atoms, tertiary hydroxyl group, and the benzyl groups were hydrogenated
within 5 min. Next, we employed tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC)-mediated
selective debenzylation in the presence of aromatic chlorine developed
by Li group,9 but under this condition
compound 25 was isolated, in which chlorine atoms and
the tertiary hydroxyl group were hydrogenated and benzyl groups were
intact (Scheme 8).
Similar results were obtained when catalytic amount of water was added
to decrease the reactivity of Pd/C in MeOH. This explains that the
hydrogenation of chlorine atoms and hydroxyl group was much faster
than the benzyl deprotection.

Scheme 8 Synthesis of Compounds 24 and 25
Next, hydroxyl groups of indanone 16 were
protected
as its TBS-ether. Compound 26 was obtained in 82% yield
after reaction of the 3,5-dihydroxy indanone 16 with
TBSCl and imidazole in dimethylformamide (DMF). When compound 26 was subjected to dichloromethine insertion, the reaction
went smoothly to afford compound 27 in 53% yield. To
our disappointment, again deprotection of TBS groups using reagents
such as HF/Py and TBAF did not afford the desired compound, instead
we observed complete decomposition of the starting material. Under
LiOAc·2H2O condition, one of the TBS group was cleaved
within 1 h to give a hydroxyl compound 28. Unfortunately,
the compound was highly unstable, it got decomposed even at 40 °C
while evaporating on rotavapor. Benzylic oxidation of compound 28 using KMnO4/MnO2 condition did not
yield the expected product this time, and decomposition of the starting
material was observed (Scheme 9).

Scheme 9 Synthesis of Compound 28
As an alternative, acetyl protection was thought
to be more suitable
anticipating a smooth dichloromethine insertion using excess n-BuLi and CH2Cl2. It was logically
assumed that more reactive ketone function would be attacked first
by the dichloromethine anion to give tertiary alcohol. Then, the excess
dichloromethine anion would attack the carbonyl carbons of two acetyl
groups, resulting in their deprotection. Accordingly, compound 29 was synthesized by acetyl protection of the 3,5-dihydroxy
indanone 16 in 96% yield. Unfortunately, the successive
reaction could lead to an uncharacterizable complex reaction mixture
but not the anticipated product (Scheme 10).

Scheme 10 Synthesis of Compound 29
Next, hydroxyl groups of indanone 16 were protected
with allyl groups. Compound 31 was obtained in 90% yield
after reaction of the 3,5-dihydroxy indanone 16 with
allyl bromide and K2CO3 in DMF. When compound 31 was subjected to dichloromethine insertion, the reaction
went smoothly to afford compound 32 in 50% yield. To
our disappointment benzylic oxidation of compound 32 using
KMnO4/MnO2 condition did not yield the expected
product, and decomposition of the starting material was observed.
Unfortunately, allyl deprotection of compound 32 was
unsuccessful, under various conditions such as Pd(PPh3)4/LiBH4, Pd(PPh3)4/K2CO3, Pd/C/KOH, and SmI2/H2O/i-PrNH2, in all of the cases either starting
material was recovered or decomposed (Scheme 11).

Scheme 11 Synthesis of Compound 32
Conclusion
In
conclusion, the first synthetic effort toward the synthesis
of tripartin has been reported. A short route to dimethyl tripartin
was accomplished in six steps with 21% overall yield starting from
commercially available 3,5-dimethoxy benzaldehyde using ClTi(OiPr)3-mediated dichloromethine
insertion as a key step.

SHELX-2017 program (Sheldrick 2017). Hydrogens were fixed geometrically,
treated as riding on their nonhydrogens, and refined isotropically,
while all nonhydrogens were subjected to anisotropic refinement.
