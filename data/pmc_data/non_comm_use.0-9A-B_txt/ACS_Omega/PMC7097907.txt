Metallic nanoparticles
(NPs) have enormous applications due to their remarkable physical
and chemical properties. The synthesis of NPs has been a matter of
concern because chemical methods are toxic. On the contrary, biological
methods are considered eco-friendly. To compare the toxicity and the
environment-friendly nature of the synthesis methodologies, cadmium
NPs were synthesized through chemical (Ch) (co-precipitation) and
biological (plant extracts as reducing agent) methods. Cadmium nitrate
was reduced with NaOH, while in the biological method, the Cd ions
were reduced by Artemisia scoparia (As)
and Cannabis sativa (Cs) extracts.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the pure single-phase cubic
structure of green and chemically synthesized CdO NPs except As-CdO
NPs that were crystalline cum amorphous in nature. The size of nanoparticles
was 84 nm (Cs-CdO NPs) and 42.2 nm (Ch-CdO NPs). The scanning electron
microscope (SEM) images exhibited an irregular disklike morphology
of nanoparticles that agglomerated more in the case of green synthesis.
The antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of NPs revealed that chemically
synthesized NPs have better antimicrobial capability, while the antioxidative
activities were better for green-synthesized NPs. However, the low
yield, high ion disassociation, and waste (unreacted metal) production
in the green synthesis of CdO NPs increase the risk of contamination
to biosphere. Both types of NPs did not affect the seed germination
of Dodonaea viscosa. However, chemically
synthesized NPs were less toxic on plant morphological response. The
study concludes that the chemically synthesized CdO NPs have better
morphology, significant antimicrobial activity, and less toxicity
to plant species compared to green-synthesized NPs. Moreover, during
the green synthesis, unreacted metals are drained, which causes contamination
to the ecosystem.

1 Introduction
Manipulation of matter
to size less than 100 nm with at least one
dimension changes the chemical and physical properties of a substance.
Nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized by biological, chemical, and physical
methods. Biosynthesis encompasses the natural reduction property catalyzed
by biomolecules in plants and microorganisms to transform metal ions
into metal NPs. In 2019, more than 17 000 publications are
focused on the green synthesis of nanoparticles, and this number is
rising continuously. Variability in plants used for extract preparation
is a major limiting factor to standardize conditions for the green
synthesis of NPs due to variations in the type and concentration of
biomolecules. However, yet plant-mediated green synthesis is considered
cost-effective, simple, rapid, and eco-friendly regardless of the
low yield of NPs.1 Quality, size, and morphology
of green-synthesized NPs are influenced by various factors, including
pH, temperature, reaction time, and concentration of metal salt.2

Chemical methods for the production of
NPs mainly include sol–gel
process, co-precipitation, microemulsion, hydrothermal, polyol, and
chemical vapor deposition. In the metal reduction (co-precipitation)
method, a solution containing a metal ion is treated with a reducing
agent. In most of the cases, NaBH4, sodium citrate, ascorbic
acid, and hydrazine are used as reducing agents, while in few cases,
a stabilizing agent might be required for the synthesis of NPs.3 Each chemical method has its own advantages and
disadvantages, i.e., the hydrothermal method gives specific shape
and size to NPs under microwave radiation.4 Microemulsion requires a large amount of surfactant and is influenced
by different external factors. Chemical-assisted reactions show high
speed and yield and produce less side products. These methods also
produce unique characteristics of size, shape, concentration, surface
charge, and morphology, which determine their potential applications.5

Commercial NPs need rigorous standards
that guarantee the quality
and performance of NPs. The physiochemical conditions during the chemical,
physical, and biological methods assist uniformity in size, shape,
and surface properties to assure similar behavior.6 In the physical and chemical methodologies, these can be
predetermined, but in the biological system, variation in biomolecules
makes it impossible to reproduce the results. Biogenic synthesis of
NPs is eco-friendly and well suited, with biological systems still
a speculation because no comparisons are made between NPs synthesized
through different routes and even the physiochemical and morphological
properties are not compared.

CdO is an n-type semiconductor
having a wide energy band gap (3.3
and 2.2 eV, respectively), ionic nature, low electrical resistivity,
and high transmittance in the visible region of the solar spectrum.
The most widely known applications of CdO NPs are in optoelectronics,
phototransistors, photodiodes, solar cells, and gas sensors.6 CdO NPs opened new horizons to eliminate cancer
cells and targeted drug delivery.7,8 CdS nanoparticles
are also used as a fluorescence probe in the determination of nucleic
acids based on the synchronous fluorescence quenching of functionalized
CdS in the presence of DNA.9,10 The antimicrobial activity
of CdO NPs is remarkable against several antibiotic-resistant pathogenic
bacteria.11,12

There is a controversy that the green
synthesis is eco-friendly
and the NPs thus produced are biocompatible compared to those produced
by other methods. In the current study, CdO nanostructures were synthesized
by the chemical precipitation method and using plant extracts of Cannabis sativa and Artemisia scoparia. This study identifies any possible difference in the properties,
yield, and toxicity of CdO NPs and the concentration of metal and
waste synthesized through green and chemical routes, as well as determines
the better route for the synthesis of CdO NPs on the basis of biological
and toxicological studies.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
CdO
NPs were synthesized by green and chemical routes under the same conditions
and procedure (Table 1). Both methodologies resulted in the formation of brown-colored
NPs. All of the syntheses were performed at the same experimental
conditions, i.e., salt, salt concentration, temperature, and pH. The
reduction of Cd ion was carried out by chemical reducing agents and
plant extracts. The reducing agent NaOH and biomolecules, i.e., phenolics,
flavonoids, alkaloids, proteins, etc., in the case of plant extracts,
are capable of reducing the metal into NPs. The reduction in this
case depends upon the choice of plant for extract preparation and
the extraction methodology because each plant and method have their
own biochemical and phytochemical properties. This is the reason that
As-CdO NPs were crystalline cum amorphous while Cs-CdO NPs were crystalline
in nature.

XRD patterns of CdO NPs showed absorbance of the diffraction peaks at 2θ values. The estimated
particle size using the relative intensity peak for Ch-CdO-NPs (chemically
synthesized CdO NPs) was 42.2 nm, and sharp peaks indicate that particles
were crystalline in nature. The peaks at the diffraction angles of
33.325, 55.658, and 66.169° are indexed to the (111), (220) and
(311) planes, respectively (Figure 1). The estimated size of the Cs-CdO NPs (CdO NPs synthesized
by C. sativa) was found to be 84 nm,
and sharp peaks show that particles were crystalline in nature. The
peaks at the diffraction angles of 33.273, 38.591, 55.606, and 66.282°
are indexed to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes, respectively
(Figure 1). Only one
peak at 31.8° was observed for As-CdO NPs (CdO NPs synthesized
by A. scoparia) (Figure 1) and that represents the crystalline cum
amorphous nature of NPs. The XRD patterns of chemically and biologically
synthesized NPs match the reference patterns for CdO nanoparticles
in the published data.13−15

Figure 1 XRD pattern of CdO nanoparticles synthesized through the
green
chemistry and co-precipitation method: Ch-CdO NPs (nanoparticles synthesized
by chemical method), Cs-CdO NPs (nanoparticles synthesized by C. sativa), and As-CdO NPs (nanoparticles synthesized
by A. scoparia).

Figure 1 also shows
that the intensity and quality of XRD peaks vary depending upon the
procedure and also the plant used for extraction and extraction procedure.
Due to the variation in plant metabolites among species and extraction
procedure, the morphology of NPs also varies. A. scoparia extract was prepared by heating, which might degrade biomolecules
responsible for the conversion of ions into NPs. Therefore, the NPs
produced by A. scoparia were crystalline
cum amorphous in nature compared to those produced by C. sativa that were only crystalline in nature.

Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra confirmed the attachment
of biomolecules responsible for capping and stabilization of the NPs.
The FTIR spectra of Ch-CdO NPs (Figure 2) show prominent peaks at 3561, 3245, 1739, 983, and
691. The peak at 3561 shows the presence of N–H symmetric stretching.
The peak at 3245 displays the presence of O–H stretching. The
peak at 1739 illustrates the presence of carbonyl stretching, while
the peaks at 983 and 691 show the presence of the CdO bond. The FTIR
spectra of Cs-CdO NPs showed prominent peaks at 3369, 3171, 1460,
714, and 613 (Figure 2). The broad FTIR absorption band at 3369 shows O–H stretching,
while the peak at 3171 indicates the presence of N–H stretching.
The peak at 1460 depicts the presence of C–H bonding of hydrocarbons.
The broad bands observed at 714 and 613 are due to the metal–oxygen
bond. Prominent peaks at 2938, 2355, 1482, 1062, and 614 were shown
by the FTIR spectra of As-CdO NPs (Figure 2). These peaks depict the stretching of C–H,
C–C, and C–O as mentioned for Cs-CdO NPs. The plant
extracts containing a higher amount of phenolics and flavonoids that
are responsible for their antioxidative response might have a role
in the reduction as well as capping and stabilization of NPs. Therefore,
diverse functional groups are observed on NPs synthesized by plant
extract; however, variation is due to distinct phytocomponents in
both plant extracts. FTIR spectra also show that green synthesis procedures
result in the attachment of functional group on the surface of NPs
and the variation in the intensity of each peak depending upon the
extract used.

green chemistry
and co-precipitation method: Ch-CdO NPs (nanoparticles synthesized
by chemical method), Cs-CdO NPs (nanoparticles synthesized by C. sativa), and As-CdO NPs (nanoparticles synthesized
by A. scoparia).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) disclosed the clear and distinct
images of green and chemically synthesized CdO NPs (Figure 3). They have irregular disklike
morphologies with Ch-CdO NPs and Cs-CdO NPs in the sizes of 10–30
and 50 nm, respectively.

2.2 Biological
Activities
2.2.1 Antioxidative Response of CdO NPs
Compounds having a high reducing power act as primary and secondary antioxidants to reduce
the oxidized intermediates of biochemical processes.16C. sativa-synthesized CdO
NPs showed significant antioxidant capacity and reducing power 6.4
± 0.38 and 12.7 ± 0.38 μg AAE/mg, respectively, in
comparison to As- and Ch-CdO NPs (Figure 4). Ch-CdO NPs, As-CdO NPs, and Cs-CdO NPs
showed 4.2, 5.4, and 4.2% radical scavenging potential, respectively.
Phenols have redox properties which make them serve as reducing agents,
hydrogen donors, and singlet oxygen quenchers. Flavonoids are groups
of polyphenolic compounds that act as scavenging and chelating agents.
NPs show biological activities due to the presence of functional groups
on the surface of NPs. Cs-CdO
NPs displayed better phenolic (3.5 ± 0.81 μgGAE/mg) and
flavonoid (3.1 ± 0.19 μg QE/mg) like contents as compared
with As-CdO NPs and Ch-CdO NPs (Figure 4). The figure also shows that C. sativa is rich with flavonoids compared to A. scoparia, which produced crystalline NPs. This depicts that flavonoids play
a more important role in the synthesis of NPs compared to flavonoids
although flavonoids are a subclass of phenolics.

of CdO NPs and plant extract. As: A. scoparia, Cs: C. sativa, As-CdO NPs: Artemesia-synthesized
CdO NPs, Cs-CdO NPs: Cannabis-synthesized
CdO NPs, Ch-CdO NPs: chemically synthesized CdO NPs. Values are presented
as mean ± standard error. Different small letters on each column
show a significant difference between values.

The nanoparticles behave as antioxidative agents due to their chemical
nature, the presence of the metal itself, and the attachment of different
functional groups on the surface of NPs.17 Through the chemical procedure, the nature of reactants defines
the attachment of functional groups that might change little during
each synthesis process. However, in the green synthesis approach,
variation of biomolecules in plants by the extraction procedure changes
the attachment of functional groups that determine the strength of
NPs during activities.18

2.2.2 Antimicrobial Activity
Chemically
synthesized CdO NPs exhibited a significant zone of inhibition against
all bacterial strains compared to green-synthesized CdO NPs (Table 2). Green-synthesized
Cs-CdO NPs showed mild to moderate behavior against all bacterial
strains except Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, i.e., 13 and 12 mm, respectively.
As-CdO NPs showed a significant zone of inhibition against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. In the case of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, all tested samples showed
mild to moderate antibacterial behavior. Similar studies have demonstrated
that CdO nanoparticles can be effective in the treatment of infectious
diseases caused by E. coli and other
bacterial strains.19−21

Chemically synthesized CdO
NPs did not show any antifungal activity
in the case of A. niger. None of the
plant extracts showed antifungal activity against all tested fungal
strains. However, the antifungal activities of C. sativa- and A. scoparia-mediated green-synthesized
nanoparticles were greater than those of chemically synthesized nanoparticles
(Table 2). Swain et
al. reported a comparative study of green- and chemically synthesized
AuNPs with respect to their antifungal properties with few variations
in size and antifungal properties.22 It
is believed that there is electromagnetic attraction between microbe
and NPs surface that make microbes oxidized and cause instant death.
CdO NPs interact with the cell membrane of bacteria and cause disruption
in the mesosome function of DNA replication, cell division, etc. Nanomaterials
inactivate protein function and decrease cell permeability, leading
to the death of the microbe.23,24

2.3 Quantification of Total Cd Metal Content and
Yield of NPs
The yield of nanoparticles is not contented
to 100% in spite of the high yield of NPs via chemical and physical
processes.25 The yield of NPs was significantly
higher (840 mg) by using the chemical method of CdO NPs synthesis. A. scoparia extract procured 390 mg of CdO NPs relative
to the C. sativa extract that yielded
only 304 mg of NPs. Table 3 shows that the Cd content was higher in chemically synthesized
NPs so the theoretical waste was less. However, by green synthesis,
higher waste depicts that the Cd content is drained into the water
as waste that causes metal contamination to water and soil. By the green synthesis approach more waste produces. In present study,
we presumed the formation of pure CdO NPs, although the FTIR analysis
showed attachment of different functional groups on the surface of
NPs.

d Cd in salt –
Cd in NPs.

The dissolution
(Table 4) of Cd from
NPs shows that increasing the concentration of
NPs increases the dissolution of Cd from NPs. However, the route of
synthesis of NPs also influences the dissolution power. Chemically
synthesized NPs released less Cd compared to the green route. The
plants used for the synthesis of CdO NPs also effect the release of
metal from NPs. Most probably, the NPs synthesized by the chemical
route are compact, and the strong interaction between elements makes
it hard to release metal. While in the case of green synthesis, attachment
of functional groups around the metal makes them less compact. There
are few studies that depict the release of metal ions from NPs; however,
the release is dependent on the concentration, shape, and route of
synthesis of NPs.26,27 CdO is dreadfully toxic, soluble
in vivo, and our results specified dissolution of green-synthesized
NPs was significantly higher compared to Ch-CdO NPs. This increases
the contamination level in the ecosystem, which is a threat to living
beings.

2.4 Toxicity
of CdO NPs Synthesized by Both Chemical
and Green Means on Dodonaea viscosa
CdO NPs showed toxicity on the morphological characteristics
(root length, shoot length, fresh weight, and dry weight) of D. viscosa depending on the concentration of NPs.
Nanoparticles synthesized through both routes did not affect the seed
germination rate (>90%). The application of a low concentration
of
NPs significantly affected the root length and shoot length (Figure 5). However, an increase
in the concentration of NPs in the media negatively influenced the
root length and a decrease was observed. NPs accumulate at the cell
surface and translocate to other parts of the plant.28 In the plasma membrane of plant roots, many ion and protein
transporters are present, which function as Cd transport.29,30 The plants grown in the presence of chemically synthesized CdO NPs
had better root length than green-synthesized NPs. Furthermore, at
lower concentration(s), CdO NPs also functioned as a growth enhancer.
The figure also shows that green-synthesized NPs retorted significant
root growth.

Figure 5 Morphological response ofD. viscosa grown in the presence of chemically and green-synthesized CdO nanoparticles.
The NPs showed varied toxicity on shoot length and root length depending
upon the type and concentration of NPs. The similar small letters
shown on bars show nonsignificant difference at p < 0.05.

Most probably, green-synthesized
NPs have more functional groups
on their surface that bind strictly with biomolecules present on the
root surface or inside the cell, increasing the toxicity (Figure 6). Additionally,
the dissolution data showed more release of Cd from green-synthesized
NPs, making them more toxic for plant growth. Almost same results
are found in the case of shoot length; however, lesser variation is
because the effect on shoot is more dependent on the transport of
NPs to the shoot and dissolution power of NPs. Growth also retards
due to protein denaturation, and the reduced uptake of nutrients is
due to the existence of NPs around vascular bundles. The decrease
of shoot length might be due to the more release of ions from particles
that accumulate in the shoot, so more exposure to ions retards their
growth.31,32 The decrease in root length might also be
due to the lower activity of H+-ATPase, which participates
in the uptake of elements by roots.

Figure 6 Toxicity mechanism of chemically and biologically
synthesized CdO
NPs. Ch-CdO NPs release a Cd ion that interacts with the surface biomolecules
and causes more damage due to influx, where it causes ROS and inactivation
of proteins, lipids, and DNA. The green-synthesized CdO NPs interact
more on the surface due to compatibility with biological system along
with release of ions.

Variations in the weight
of plants grown in the presence of NPs
show that fresh weight and dry matter are not directly affected by
the concentration and type of NPs (Table 5). Fresh weight is a property of an individual
plant that shows biomass and water content of the plant, while dry
matter is based on the water retention capability of the plant. Therefore,
a variation in fresh and dry weights can be observed. This behavior
is due to the overcompensation response, in which there is a disruption
of homeostasis by chemical substances called the “hormetic
effect”. Biomass accumulation also associates with the primary
metabolism, mainly the nitrogen and carbon metabolism that contributes
to cellular growth and cell components.33−35 Biomass reduction can
also be due to the reduced availability of nutrients and water, which
disturbs the normal cellular function required for proper growth.36

3 Experimental
Section
3.1 Synthesis of CdO NPs
CdO NPs were
prepared by chemical synthesis through the co-precipitation method
described by Shanmugam et al. with slight modifications.37 For the synthesis of CdO NPs, 50 mL of 0.5 M
Cd (NO3)2·4H2O was mixed dropwise
with 50 mL of a NaOH (0.5 M) solution. The reaction was continued
for 2 h at 60 °C. The NPs were collected by centrifugation at
10 000 rpm for 10 min at 25 °C and washed thrice. The
NPs were dried at 70 °C and calcinated at 400 °C for 2 h
to obtain the CdO nanoparticles.

For the green synthesis of
CdO NPs, fresh leaves of C. sativa were
collected from Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan, and an A. scoparia plant was collected from Pa̅ṛachina̅r,
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The plants were identified by Taxonomist
Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad,
following authentic plant sheets preserved in herbarium and flora
of Pakistan. Fresh leaves of C. sativa were washed repeatedly with water to remove dirt, rinsed with distilled
water thoroughly, and then air-dried. Distilled water (200 mL) and
air-dried leaves (20 g) were blended to prepare the aqueous extract.
After that, the extract was collected by filtration through a Whatman
No. 1 filter paper, followed by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min
at 25 °C. A supernatant was used for the synthesis of CdO nanoparticles.

Whole plant of A. scoparia was washed
with distilled water and dried under sunlight. The dried plant was
ground into a fine powder; 30 g of the plant was soaked into 150 mL
of distilled water and kept at room temperature for 12 h. The mixture
was heated for 10 min at 50–60 °C to make the extract.
The extract was collected by filtration through a Whatman No. 1 filter
paper, followed by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min at 25 °C.
A supernatant was used for the synthesis of CdO nanoparticles.

CdO NPs were synthesized by mixing 25 mL of C. sativa extract and 50 mL of A. scoparia extract
with 0.5 M Cd(NO3)2·4H2O separately.
The mixture was heated at 70 °C for 3 h with constant stirring
on a magnetic stirrer. Particles were collected by centrifugation
at 10 000 rpm for 10 min at 25 °C. The NPs were washed
thrice, dried in an oven at 80 °C for 10 h, and calcinated at
400 °C for 2 h.

3.2 Characterization of CdO
NPs
X-ray
diffraction of CdO NPs was carried out using a D8 Advance having a
Cu Kα radiation source of 1.54 Å with 1200 W X-ray energy.
The scanning was done in the 2θ range of 10–70°.
The Scherrer equation was used to calculate the size, i.e., D = 0.9λ/β cos θ, where D is the diffraction angle, λ is the Cu Kα wavelength
(1.54 Å), θ is the diffraction angle, and β is the
full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak. NicoletTM380
was used for the FTIR spectroscopy of CdO NPs. The dried pellet samples
were used to test the surface functional groups by FTIR spectroscopy
1000–3500 cm–1 in the transmittance mode.
The morphology of CdO NPs was investigated by a scanning electron
microscope (MIRA3 TESCAN) operating at an acceleration voltage of
20 kV. Thin films of the samples were prepared on a silicon wafer
by dropping a very small amount of sample onto the silicon wafer.

3.3 Quantification of Cd Metal Content
To quantify
the Cd content in NPs, 10 mg of each NPs was acid-digested
using a 4:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and perchloric
acid (HClO4) in a conical flask at 110 °C. The remaining
was diluted with 50 mL of 1% nitric acid. The contents were then transferred
to properly rinsed plastic bottles for the quantification of total
Cd metal content by atomic absorption spectroscopy. To investigate
the dissolution of Cd metal from NPs, four concentrations (2.5, 5,
10, and 20 mg/L) were used. NPs were suspended in distilled water
(pH 6.5) for 18 h at room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatant
was used to check the dissolution of Cd metal from NPs by atomic absorption
spectroscopy.

3.4 Biological Properties of
Cd NPs
The
plant extracts and nanoparticles, 4 mg each, were dissolved in 1 mL
of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and used for characterizing the antibacterial,
antifungal, and antioxidative activities (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-based free-radical scavenging
activity, total antioxidant potential, total reducing power) and nonenzymatic
antioxidant properties (phenolics- and flavonoids-like properties).
The detailed protocols have already been published.38,39

3.5 Toxicological Assessment of CdO NPs
Four
concentrations of NPs (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg/L) were added in
MS media. The MS media was augmented with 3% sucrose and solidified
with 0.44% gelrite. The medium was sonicated for 30 min to avoid aggregation
of NPs, and pH was adjusted to 5.6–5.8. The media was poured
into conical flasks (30/100 mL) by constant shaking for equal distribution
of NPs in every flask. After that, the flasks were autoclaved at 121
°C, 15 psi for 20 min and allowed to cool up to 45 °C; shook
well, and kept at −4 °C until solidification to avoid
settling of NPs at base.

Seeds of D. viscosa were collected from Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad. The seeds
were cleaned to make them free of foreign materials. The germination
efficiency of the seeds was >90%. The seeds were sterilized under
aseptic conditions by immersing in a freshly prepared 0.1% mercuric
chloride solution for 20 s and then washed thrice with distilled water.
The seeds blotted on a filter paper were inoculated in MS medium augmented
with CdO NPs flasks. Four seeds per flask were inoculated, and the
flasks were kept in a growth room at 25 °C with a photoperiod
of 8/16 h. Seed germination started after 1 week and kept for 4 weeks
to obtain full growth of plantlets. The morphological characters of
the plantlets were measured and kept in an incubator at 40 °C
for 24 h for drying to calculate dry biomass.

3.6 Statistical
Analysis
To investigate
the effect of NPs on D. viscosa (collected
from the vicinity of Quaid-i-Azam University after authentication
of taxonomist), five flasks of each concentration were inoculated,
each containing four seeds. Data were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation. All antioxidative tests and other assays were performed
in triplicate. The means were further analyzed by least significant
difference (LSD) using Origin (8.5) software.

4 Conclusions
In summary, CdO NPs were successfully synthesized
by the chemical
precipitation method and green approach using C. sativa and A. scoparia extracts. CdO NPs
were crystalline in nature except As-CdO NPs that were crystalline
cum amorphous in nature. The size of nanoparticles varied depending
upon the mode and reactants used for synthesis. Green-synthesized
CdO NPs increase the risk of contamination in the ecosystem because
of high dissolution power and low yield with maximum waste. Furthermore,
there was a minor variation in response to biological activities and
toxicological study. Based on the results, it can be concluded that
although green-synthesized NPs might be less compatible to the living
system, there is variation in the characteristics of nanoparticles.
The green synthesis approach also produces more waste (unreacted metal)
that is drained into the water flow. This causes contamination in
water, soil, and, of course, the food chain, thereby causing a serious
threat to humans.
