The chemistry between
layered MWW zeolite and carbon black pearls
(BP 2000) as an inexpensive hard template was investigated to develop
a rational one-pot synthesis of MCM-22 microspheres. The characterization
results showed that the insertion of BP 2000 in the gel synthesis
did not substantially compromise the crystallinity and microporosity,
and the microscopic analyses showed that BP 2000 played a key role
in controlling the final morphology of the MCM-22 zeolite, creating
beautiful dandelion-like microspherical particles. The morphology
obtained is due to the tortuous shape of the hard template, the particular
MWW particle crystals, the interaction with the external surface of
the MWW zeolitic precursor, and the synthesis conditions. The stacking
of MWW crystals with edge-to-face orientations generates meso-/macrovoids,
allowing access to the interiors of the microspheres. The microspheres
were homogeneous with sizes ranging from 6 to 8 μm with an increase
of the external surface and a macroporous size distribution centered
at 200 nm, which is two times that of the traditional MCM-22 zeolite.

Introduction
Zeolites play key roles
in a variety of processes, for example,
adsorption, molecular sieving, ion exchange, and catalysis.1,2 Recently, zeolites have been applied to new fields, including medicine,
cosmetics, food industry, microelectronics, and luminescence.3,4 This versatility is due to their microporous crystalline nature
composed of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedral coordinated
by oxygen atoms. The organization of these tetrahedral units generates
porous structures with different types of cavities and channels.

In the last few years, much effort has been given to increase the
efficiencies of zeolite-based catalysts.5 As an example, to improve the physicochemical properties of materials,
additional intracrystalline and/or intercrystalline porosity was introduced
to achieve shorter diffusion pathways to facilitate the transport
of bulky reactants and products.6 In addition,
adapting zeolites and catalysts in hollow, nano-, and microspherical
morphologies is still an emerging and innovative field of materials
chemistry.7,8 The construction of a large internal void
and its capacity to capsule molecules or nanoparticles serving as
nanoreactors for catalytic reactions, drug/gene delivery, or medical
imaging has been of considerable interest during the last few decades.9−11 Furthermore, if the catalytic activity is not compromised, controlling
large-sized catalyst particles may be favorable for recyclability
of the catalyst in reaction media by filtration or centrifugation
processes.12

Among the two main strategies,
the “bottom-up” and
“top-down” approaches, to modify zeolites, bottom-up
approaches make use of soft or hard templates to generate hierarchical
zeolites.13 Typically, soft-templating
approaches use cationic surfactants,14 whereas
hard-templating approaches utilize carbon particles,15 polymers,16,17 bacteria,18 rice husks,19 starches,20 diatomite,21 CaCO3,22 or mesoporous silica particles.23

Specifically, carbon particles are a class
of materials that include
carbon spheres, nanotubes, carbon mesostructures from Korea (CMK),
and three-dimensionally ordered macroporous carbon replicas.24−28 Whereas carbon nanotubes are still expensive to use as hard templates,
carbon spheres, such as carbon black pearls 2000 (BP 2000), are an
inexpensive source of carbon obtained by an incomplete combustion
of aromatic petroleum residues.29 The average
carbon particles (12 nm) are tortuous aggregates, which form agglomerated
carbon particles.26 Their use in the synthesis
of zeolites by steam-assisted and static crystallization procedures
has been reported to produce hierarchical MFI (Mobil Five) mesoporous-type
zeolites and MFI zeolites with meso- and macrovoids, respectively.24,30 However, in the latter case, inhomogeneous and nonspherical particles
are formed.

The use of BP 2000 has been widespread for the synthesis
of other
zeolites, for example, ZSM-12, ZSM-11, and TS-1.31,32 Additionally, BP 2000 has been used to produce small crystals by
confined space synthesis, where the porous and inert matrix of carbon
dictates the crystal size generated in the synthesis. Indeed, after
removal of the carbon matrix, very small crystals are formed with
high crystallinity for ZSM-5, beta, X, and zeolite A.33,34 To the best of our knowledge, these have been the only studies to
utilize BP 2000 as a hard template.

Moreover, much effort has
been made to modify the morphologies
and properties of zeolites with layered structures.35−37 Indeed, layered
zeolites are considered the most promising materials to replace the
currently used catalysts and advance the areas of study on porous
and hierarchical materials.35 Among layered
zeolites, the MWW precursor is widely versatile in generating materials
with different pore architectures, for example, pillared, delaminated,
and disordered.38−40 However, all these procedures have focused on soft-templating
approaches. As the chemistry between layered MWW zeolites and hard
templates is relatively unknown, we explored, for the first time,
the utilization of BP 2000 as an inexpensive hard template in the
traditional synthesis of MCM-22 by a one-pot approach.

Results and Discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of traditional (P)MCM-22 and
the precursor with BP 2000 ((P)MCM-22-BP) and calcined MCM-22-BP are
shown in Figure 1.
For both MWW precursors, the diffraction peaks showed the same intensities,
which indicates that BP 2000 insertion did not compromise the crystallinity.
The diffraction bands located at 2θ = 6.6° correspond to
the (002) plane relative to the MWW zeolitic layer stacking with a d-spacing of 2.6 nm. These layers are connected by hydrogen
bonds between the silanol groups, and the hexamethyleneimine (HMI)
template molecules are located between the layers. After calcination,
the silanol groups were condensed together with the elimination of
the interlayer organic template, leading to the three-dimensional
MCM-22-BP zeolite. In addition, intralayer diffraction bands located
at 2θ = 7.1° correspond to the (100) plane, and reflections
at higher 2θ angles of 25.1° and 26.2° are assigned
to the (220) and (310) planes, respectively. The obtained product
(P)MCM-22-BP showed a yield of 100%, which is similar to that of the
traditional (P)MCM-22. The dried product (P)MCM-22-BP was a homogeneous
white gray color when compared with the common beige color of traditional
(P)MCM-22 as shown in Figure 1. This indicates that BP 2000 did not form isolated aggregates
in the (P)MCM-22-BP sample.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of synthesized (P)MCM-22-BP, calcined
MCM-22-BP, and
traditional (P)MCM-22

The ICP (inductively coupled plasma) analysis of the calcined
materials
showed Si/Al molar ratios of 23 and 25 for MCM-22-BP and traditional
MCM-22, respectively. Therefore, the insertion of BP 2000 did not
affect the crystallization efficiency of aluminum during nucleation.
The aluminum in zeolites could occupy framework or extra-framework
positions, which correspond to the aluminum in the tetrahedral (Altet) or octahedral (Aloct) coordination. To distinguish
the chemical environment of the aluminum of the samples, Figure 2 shows the 27Al MAS (magic-angle spinning) NMR spectra of the MCM-22-BP and traditional
MCM-22 zeolites. The signals at ca. 50 ppm are characteristic of Altet, and the signals at ca. 0 ppm are characteristic of Aloct. It was observed that both samples showed a higher signal
at ca. 50 ppm, which corresponded to a higher population of Altet than Aloct. It was also observed that Altet in MCM-22-BP has a greater proportion (75%) than in the
traditional MCM-22 sample (62%). This difference suggests that the
insertion of the black pearls acts in some way to prevent the formation
of extra-framework aluminum. However, this hypothesis requires further
study.

MCM-22 (b) samples.

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms of the MCM-22 materials
are shown in Figure 3 (image a). Both MCM-22 zeolites exhibited type I isotherms, which
confirms their microporous nature.41 However,
the adsorption isotherms for both zeolites showed a quick increase
of nitrogen amount adsorbed at relative pressures higher than p/p0 = 0.8, corresponding to
the nitrogen adsorption on intercrystalline porosity (larger mesopores
or macropores), where the MCM-22-BP sample showed a total pore volume
(VTP) value higher than that of the traditional
MCM-22 zeolite. The micropore volume (Vmicro) of MCM-22-BP was 0.14 cm3 g–1, and
that of traditional MCM-22 was 0.19 cm3 g–1.

Figure 3 Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K (a), carbon
dioxide adsorption isotherms at 273 K (b), curves of mercury intrusion–extrusion
(c), and pore size distributions of the MCM-22-BP and traditional
MCM-22 zeolites (d).

The MCM-22 zeolite presents micropores with 0.52 nm, which
is in
the range of ultramicropores. However, N2 at −196
°C shows diffusion problems (the adsorption is carried out at
a very low temperature), and the correct characterization of the micropores
should be with CO2 as the probe molecule at 0 °C.42,43 Thus, the characterization of the narrow microporosity with the
CO2 adsorption isotherms of MCM-22-BP and MCM-22 samples
are shown in Figure 3 (image b). The shape of the isotherms (such as the type I isotherm)
is similar for the two studied zeolites. It was observed that the Vmicro-CO2 values of MCM-22-BP
and traditional MCM-22 were 0.19 and 0.21 cm3 g–1, respectively, which are less than the Vmicro obtained by the N2 isotherms. The decrease of Vmicro (for CO2) of MCM-22-BP when
compared to traditional MCM-22 may be attributed to the inhibition
of the formation of the microporous structure to some degree and/or
the presence of carbon residues in the micropores. Indeed, the weight
loss values obtained by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in Table 1 show that the weight
loss was higher for MCM-22-BP (2.51%) than for traditional MCM-22
(1.75%) at temperatures above 180 °C. In addition, the CHN (carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen) elemental  analyses Figure 3 (image d)), which is consistent
with the two independent porous systems (bidirectional and sinusoidal)
of ten-membered rings of the MWW structure with 0.52 nm of internal
diameter. This indicates that BP 2000 insertion did not substantially
affect the formation of the microporous structure of the MCM-22-BP
zeolite.

Regarding characterization of the
macropores, the curves of mercury
intrusion–extrusion for both zeolites are shown in Figure 3 (image c). It is possible to observe that the MCM-22-BP presents
a mercury intrusion volume two times as high as that of the MCM-22
sample (as reflected in the VTP-Hg values). The macropore size distribution (right side of Figure 4 (image c)) shows
that the macropore population between 50 and 3000 nm (with 200 nm
of modal pore size) increased considerably in the MCM-22-BP zeolite
with respect to the MCM-22 sample. This result is consistent with
the macrovoids shown by the regions with less density contrast in
the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis shown in Figures 6 and S1 (image a). In addition, Figure 4 (image c) shows the entrapment level of
mercury (VENT-Hg) for a pore size
of 8 μm (corresponding to 0.16 MPa of pressure) for both samples,
where MCM-22-BP has an entrapment level three times as high as that
of the MCM-22 zeolite. This fact is related to a network of interconnected
pores between the macrovoids and their narrow inlets; thus, in the
extrusion process, the mercury is trapped in the macrovoids.

Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analyses in Figure 4 (images a,e,f) show the platelet
crystals of the traditional (P)MCM-22 zeolite, and Figure 5 (image b) shows the formation
of homogeneous microspherical particles of (P)MCM-22-BP with sizes
ranging between 6 and 8 μm, which are maintained after calcination
(images c,d). These microspheres are formed by the aggregation of
thin MWW crystal platelets stacked in edge-to-face orientations. In
addition, macrovoids (see the dark regions in the microspheres in
images c,d), which allow access to the microspheres, were also observed. Figure 4 (images e,f) shows the traditional morphology of MCM-22,
and its crystalline particles are randomly oriented, which is clearly
different from MCM-22-BP.

Figure 5 TEM of MCM-22-BP spheres (a,b) and a border
region with an edge-to-face
orientation of MWW crystals (c).

TEM analysis shows that the MCM-22-BP microspheres are formed
by
the aggregation of MWW platelets on a beautiful dandelion-like morphology
as shown in Figure 5 (images a,b). The spheres were not dense,
allowing access to their interiors by macrovoids (image c). We compared
the microspherical morphology of the dandelion-like MCM-22-BP zeolite
with the doughnut-like morphology of the MCM-22 zeolite obtained under
static conditions in Figure 6. It was observed that MCM-22-static (image
a) formed large and dense particles with dimensions of 18 μm
× 16 μm, which are obtained by the stacking of several
MWW crystal platelets in face-to-face orientations. In contrast, the
dandelion-like microspheres (image b) are not a proper hollow-shell
structure but consist of edge-to-face orientations of MWW crystal
layers in the entire microsphere. The orientation of the crystal layers
was reflected in the different Sext values
of the samples. The MCM-22-static showed 56 m2 g–1 and the MCM-22-BP showed 130 m2 g–1 (the complete textural properties of the MCM-22-static are shown
in Figure S2).

It was reported that carbon black pearl BP 2000 possesses
an average
particle size of 12 nm, which increases its ability to form aggregates
and consequently agglomerates.44,45 In fact, these aggregates
are reported to form tortuous mesoporous structures to a higher degree
than carbon nanofibers in the static synthesis of ZSM-5.26 In our case, most of the MWW crystals are formed
by platelets with thicknesses of 20–30 nm (8–12 MWW
stacked layers each with a thickness of 2.5 nm), which are in an edge-to-face
orientation (see Figure S1, image a). In
addition, TEM analysis of the MWW crystals (Figure S1, images b,c) did not show intracrystalline mesopores or
defects, which confirms that small and tortuous aggregates of BP 2000
limit the interaction of BP 2000 only to the external surfaces of
the MWW crystals.

The crystallization of (P)MCM-22-BP was followed
by XRD (see Figure S3). On the first day,
only a broad reflection
between the 2θ range of 15 and 30°, characteristic of an
amorphous phase, was observed. Crystallization begins on the second
day because of the emergence of intracrystalline (100), (220), and
(310) reflection planes, which precedes the stacking of the layers
of the basal reflections (002) that appears on the third day. The
following days are characterized by growth and crystallization until
the seventh day.

To understand the interaction between BP 2000
and the zeolitic
structure, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of the BP 2000
was carried out and is shown in Figure S4. The FTIR results showed a band at 1680 cm–1,
which is characteristic of the stretching mode of carbonyl (C=O)
groups (aldehyde, ketone, ester, and/or carboxylic acid). Additionally,
the signals at 2112, 2627, and 3066 cm–1 (broad
band) and 3554 cm–1 are associated with the stretching
modes of alkynyl (C≡C), O–H from carboxylic acid, alkenyl
C–H, and phenol O–H groups, respectively.46 Therefore, the gel precursor is rich in silanol
and amino groups derived from HMI as well as Si–O and Al–O
bonds, which interact with BP 2000 via hydrogen bonding. Furthermore,
it is more probable that silanol groups on the surface of the MWW
lamellae are saturated by HMI, which is more basic than any of the
functional groups of BP 2000, and consequently, some part of HMI should
be replaced by carbon black. Indeed, weight loss values between 180
and 480 °C (see Table 1) confirm that the HMI content in (P)MCM-22-BP was 11% and
less than that in traditional (P)MCM-22 (12.3%). Furthermore, TGA
analysis of BP 2000 (Figure S4, image b)
showed that total oxidation of BP 2000 occurred at 480–800
°C with a maximum loss centering at 580 °C. Indeed, weight
loss values above the temperature of 480 °C is referred to oxidation
of BP 2000, some remaining HMI molecules, which were not previously
oxidized, and dihydroxylation water produced by condensation phenomenon
of surface silanol groups. The weight loss value above the temperature
of 480 °C was higher for the (P)MCM-22-BP (7.73%) than for the
traditional (P)MCM-22 (5.70%). The elemental CHN analyses in Table 1 confirmed the higher
C content in (P)MCM-22-BP than in the traditional (P)MCM-22 sample,
which is attributed to the presence of BP 2000.

We summarize
the formation of dandelion-like microspheres in the
scheme shown in Figure 7. BP 2000 was added into the gel solution followed by a slow dropwise
addition of colloidal silica. Then, stumbling under hydrothermal conditions
proceeded. On the first day, only an amorphous phase was observed,
and on the second day, MWW crystallization began. The tortuous shape
of the agglomerated BP 2000 and its interaction via hydrogen bonds
with the gel precursor where some HMI molecules were replaced by the
functional groups of the BP 2000, allowing the growth of MWW crystals
in an edge-to-face orientation. On the seventh day, a microsphere
with a dandelion-like morphology was obtained.

Conclusions
We demonstrate an easy
way to integrate intercrystalline macroporosity
and morphology control in the MCM-22 zeolite with a one-pot approach
using BP 2000 as an inexpensive hard template. It was observed that
BP 2000 plays a key role in creating a dandelion-like microspherical
morphology for the MCM-22 zeolite. The microspheres were not dense
and were composed of MWW crystalline particles in edge-to-face orientations
in the entire microspheres. The stacking of the crystals allowed access
in several directions to the microsphere interiors. The introduction
of BP 2000 as a hard template did not compromise the crystallinity
and efficiency of aluminum during nucleation. In addition, the microporous
nature was substantially maintained followed by the increase of intercrystalline
porosity with larger mesopores and macropores than with traditional
MCM-22. These results showed that it is possible to achieve controlled
large-sized particles in the MCM-22 zeolite without compromising crystallinity
and microporosity. The applications of dandelion-like MCM-22 are currently
being explored.

Experimental Section
The synthesis
of the (P)MCM-22 precursor with a Si/Al = 25
molar ratio was done similar to the literature .39 Under stirring, 9.25 mmol of sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Sigma-Aldrich)
and 4.51 mmol of sodium aluminate (NaAlO2, Riedel-de-Haën)
were dissolved in 4.51 mol of distilled water. Then, 50.21 mmol of
HMI (Sigma-Aldrich) and carbon black BP 2000 (Cabot) were added into
the mixture. The weight ratio between the aluminum used for the synthesis
and BP-2000 is 12. After 30 min, 100 mmol of colloidal silica (AS
40, Sigma-Aldrich) was slowly added dropwise into the mixture. The
gel was stirred for 2 h and hydrothermally treated in a polytetrafluoroethylene-lined
stainless-steel autoclave at 135 °C for 7 days with stumbling
(60 rpm). The autoclaved sample was quenched, filtered, washed with
distilled water, and dried overnight at 60 °C and was labeled
(P)MCM-22-BP. The sample was calcined at 580 °C for 12 h and
labeled MCM-22-BP. For the traditional synthesis of the MCM-22 precursor
((P)MCM-22), no BP 2000 was added to the gel composition.

For
comparison, the synthesis of the MCM-22 zeolite under static
conditions was carried out as described in the previous literature:47 The Si/Al molar ratio was 25 and 16 days of
crystallization at 150 °C. Filtration, drying, and calcination
were performed similarly to the previous samples. The material was
named MCM-22-static.

Characterization
Powder XRD patterns
were collected on a PANalytical Cubix FAST
diffractometer using Cu Kα1 radiation and an X’Celerator
detector in Bragg–Brentano geometry.

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms at −196
°C were measured with an Autosorb-1 MP equipment (Quantachrome
Instruments), and the carbon dioxide adsorption at 0 °C (up to
10 bar) was performed in an ASAP-2050 (Micromeritics). Before the
measurements, the samples were outgassed for 12 h at 250 °C.
The specific surface area (SBET) was calculated
by the BET (Brauer, Emmet and Teller) method from the nitrogen adsorption
data in the relative pressure range from 0.007 to 0.04.48 The VTP was obtained
applying the Gurvich rule from the adsorbed amount of N2 at a relative pressure of 0.98.49 The
external surface area (Sext) and Vmicro were estimated with the αS-plot method using N2 adsorption data and the LiChrospher
Si-1000 macroporous silica as reference material. The Vmicro-CO2, using CO2 adsorption
data, was estimated by the Dubinin–Radushkevich method. The
micropore size distributions were obtained from the CO2 adsorption data using the Horvath–Kawazoe method. In addition,
to study the macropores of the zeolites, their textural characterization
was complemented by mercury porosimetry (Autopore III 9410, Micromeritics).

Elemental analysis was determined by an ICP Varian 715-ES ICP optical
emission spectrometer after dissolution of the solids in a HNO3/HF solution. The CHN analysis was performed using a PerkinElmer
M CHN Analyzer 2400.

TGA/differential thermal analysis was performed
on a Mettler-Toledo
TGA/SDTA851E in air flux with a heating range of 10 °C min–1.

FTIR spectrometry was performed by a PerkinElmer
instrument, SPECTRUM
65 model, using the attenuated total reflection method, and data were
recorded from 4000 to 650 cm–1 with a resolution
of 1 cm–1.

SEM micrographs were recorded on
a ZEISS Ultra 55 microscope operating
at 2 kV. TEM analysis was recorded on a Philips CM10 operating at
100 kV.

Solid-state NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature
with
a Bruker AV 400 spectrometer. 27Al MAS NMR spectra were
recorded with a spinning rate of 10 kHz and a 9° pulse length
of 0.5 μs with a 1 s repetition time. 27Al chemical
shifts were referenced to Al3+(H2O)6.
