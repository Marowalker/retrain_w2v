Bio-oil
produced from pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass consists
of several hundreds of oxygenated compounds resulting in a very low
quality with poor characteristics of low stability, low pH, low stability,
low heating value, high viscosity, and so on. Therefore, to use bio-oil
as fuel for vehicles, it needs to be upgraded using a promising channel.
On the other hand, raw bio-oil can also be a good source of many specialty
chemicals, e.g., 5-HMF, levulinic acid, cyclohexanone, phenol, etc.
In this study, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, a bio-oil component that represents
the phenolic fraction of bio-oil, is considered as a model compound
and its ring saturation is carried out to produce cyclohexane and
cyclohexanone along with various other intermediate products using
density functional theory. The geometry optimization, vibrational
frequency, and intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations are carried
out at the B3LYP/6-311+g(d,p) level of theory. Furthermore, a single
point energy calculation is performed at each structure at the M06-2X/6-311+g(3df,2p)//B3LYP/6-311+g(d,p)
level of theory to accurately predict the energy requirements. According
to bond dissociation energy calculations, the dehydrogenation of formyl
group of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is the least energy demanding bond
cleavage. The production of cyclohexane has a lower energy of activation
than the production of cyclohexanone.

1 Introduction
Due
to declining fossil fuels and increasing pollution, there is
a strong necessity to find an alternative and clean energy resource
that can aid the present energy demands and reduce the pollution level.
Currently, renewable energy resources, e.g., tidal energy, solar energy,
biomass, wind energy, geothermal energy, and so on, are being largely
utilized. They are providing a good relief for the present energy
demand; however, their proper utilization still needs to be explored.
Nevertheless, out of all renewable energy resources, only biomass
has the ability to deliver sustainable carbon element.1−4 The sustainability of carbon element is necessary to achieve the
production of transportation fuels or specialty chemicals.5 The lignocellulosic biomass is cheap, abundant,
and easily available in most countries; therefore, the research based
on lignocellulosic biomass conversion into biofuel has enormously
increased in the last few decades.2 The
lignocellulosic biomass basically contains three fractions, viz.,
lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose.1,6 The research
based on the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of lignocellulosic
biomass has received considerable attention in the past few years,
but the lignin fraction has been ignored constantly because of its
complex structure, although it has a high energy density compared
to other two fractions.7 Nevertheless,
there are various channels to convert the lignocellulosic biomass
into bio-oil, e.g., pyrolysis, liquefaction, hydrolysis, and gasification,
and the pyrolysis process has been reviewed to be the most economical
and advantageous.3,8 However, the bio-oil produced
from pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass comprises several hundreds
of oxygenated compounds that lower its quality, endowing it with low
heating value, low pH, low stability, low stability, high viscosity,
and so on.4 Therefore, it needs to be upgraded
to serve as a fuel for vehicles. Furthermore, unprocessed bio-oil
is a great source of many specialty or platform chemicals, such as
hydroxymethyl furfural, furfural, levulinic acid, dimethyl furan,
and so on.1,5

As it has been pointed out that cellulose
and hemicellulose fractions
have received much attention compared to the lignin fraction, in this
study, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, a component of phenolic fraction derived
from lignin, has been selected as the bio-oil model compound. In the
past, a few phenolic components, such as guaiacol,9−15 catechol,9,16 phenol,10,14,16,17 vanillin,18,19 anisole,14 and so on, have been studied
both experimentally and numerically. This component has been recently
considered by Verma and Kishore20 for its
decomposition into benzene as the end product; however, there has
been no further study regarding its ring saturation, which is more
likely to occur in the presence of high hydrogen pressure-based hydrodeoxygenation
conditions. Although a few authors21−24 have carried out pyrolysis of
a few bio-oil model compounds and observed 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde as
one of the products in the pyrolysis product mixtures, further experiments
for upgrading 2-HB have not been carried out to date. For instance,
Robichoud et al.21 carried out a pyrolysis
study on dimethoxybenzene model compound and observed 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
as one of the products. Similarly, Zhang et al.24 also carried out pyrolysis study on the lignin dimer model
compound and reported 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde as one of the products
along with guaiacol, catechol, and others. Since 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
comprises two oxy-functionals, namely, hydroxyl and aldehyde groups,
it still needs to be upgraded to achieve the nonoxygenated component.
Therefore, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is selected as the bio-oil model
compound and its conversion to lower fractions has been numerically
attempted here.

In this numerical study, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
is allowed to undergo
two reaction pathways producing cyclohexane and cyclohexanone, respectively.
These reaction schemes are depicted in Figure 1. The notations in Figure 1 are labeled as X_Y, where X denotes the reaction pathway number and Y denotes
the structure under that reaction pathway. Similarly, transition-state
structures in the potential energy surfaces (PESs) are denoted as TSX_Y, where X is the
reaction pathway number and Y denotes the transition-state
number.

Figure 1 Reaction schemes for the conversion of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

In Figure 1, it
can be seen that the reaction pathway 1 produces cyclohexane. The
preparatory part of reaction pathway 1 is the hydrogenation of carbon
atom (para-positioned to OH group), followed by ring saturation of
2-hydroxybenzaldehyde using five further atomic hydrogenation reactions.
The produced component 1_f after the ring saturation
undergoes hydroxyl cleavage, followed by a single-step hydrogenation
reaction to produce 1_h. Finally, structure 1_h follows two pathways. Under primary reaction pathway 1, the formyl
group is cleaved, followed by a single-step hydrogenation reaction
to produce cyclohexane, and under secondary reaction pathway 1, i.e.,
1a, structure 1_h undergoes decarbonylation reaction
to produce cyclohexane. On the other hand, reaction pathway 2 starts
from the dihedral change of hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group to
initiate the keto–enol tautomerization reaction. The keto–enol
tautomerization reaction of structure 2_a produces 2_b, which further undergoes ring saturation to produce structure 2_f. Finally, structure 2_f undergoes the decarbonylation
reaction to produce cyclohexanone. All reaction steps of each reaction
pathway are considered theoretically at the B3LYP/6-311+g(d,p) level
of the theory under density functional theory (DFT) framework. The
single point energy (SPE) calculation is performed for each structure
at the M06-2X/6-311+g(3df,2p)//B3LYP/6-311+g(d,p) level of theory
to predict energies accurately.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Bond Dissociation Energy
(BDE)
A
thorough analysis of bond dissociation energy (BDE) of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
with all possible bond cleavages was reported in our previous work.20 It has been reported that bond dissociation
energies of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde are quite high, i.e., in the range
of 92–115 kcal/mol. The least energy demanding bond cleavage,
i.e., D3 (dehydrogenation of the formyl group), requires 92.22 kcal/mol.20 Along with the most favorable bond dissociation
site D3, dehydrogenation of the hydroxyl group (D2) was reported as
the second most favorable bond cleavage site.20 It is also clear that dehydrogenation of phenyl ring of 2-HB is
not favorable at all because the energy demand due to each hydrogen
bond cleavage from phenyl ring of 2-HB is in the range of 112–115
kcal/mol.20 Therefore, cleavage of hydrogen
atoms from phenyl ring is not advisable. In such scenario of high
bond dissociation energies due to scissions of atoms/functionals of
2-HB, it is highly probable that the ring saturation of 2-HB may lead
to a low energy demanding reaction pathway, which is the aim of this
work. There are two ways of saturating the aromatic ring of 2-HB,
i.e., first by direct ring hydrogenation and second by keto–enol
tautomerization followed by ring hydrogenation.

2.2 Reaction Pathway 1
Reaction pathway
1 is about the direct ring hydrogenation reaction. The potential energy
surfaces (PESs) of reaction pathways 1 and 1a are shown in Figure 2, and the corresponding
optimized molecular structures are shown in Figure 3. Interatomic bond distances in the transition-state
structures of Figure 3 are shown in angstrom (Å) units. The Cartesian coordinates
of a few optimized molecular structures are given in the Supporting Information.

Figure 2 Potential energy surfaces
of reaction pathways 1 and 1a.

Figure 3 Optimized molecular structures of reaction pathways 1 and 1a.

The reaction pathway 1 starts
with a single-step hydrogenation
reaction at the fifth carbon position of the aromatic ring of the
2-hydroxybenzaldehyde structure (see structure 1_a in Figure 1), followed by another
atomic hydrogenation reaction to saturate the generated radical by
the first hydrogenation reaction. The first hydrogenation reaction
requires 4.62 kcal/mol of activation barrier (see TS1_1 in Figures 3 and 4) according to single point energetics at the M06-2X/6-311+g(3df,2p)//B3LYP/6-311+g(d,p)
level of theory.

Figure 4 Potential energy surface of reaction pathway 2.

As it is known that bond dissociation
and radical recombination
reactions do not possess any transition-state structure, the energy
release during the recombination reaction of structure 1_a and H radicals is calculated by BDE approximation. According to
BDE at the B3LYP/6-311+g(d,p) level of theory, the recombination of
radicals 1_a and H to produce structure 1_b releases 73.58 kcal/mol of energy. Further, another transition-state
structure is located for the hydrogenation reaction of structure 1_b to produce 1_c at potential energy surface
(PES) as TS1_2 that requires only 2.89 kcal/mol of energy
to surpass the barrier height. This follows through another radical
recombination reaction of structure 1_c and H that releases
82.60 kcal/mol of energy. Similar to the reaction steps 2-HB → 1_a → 1_b, further hydrogenation reactions
of structure 1_d are carried out as 1_d → 1_e → 1_f, where the activation barrier
of 1_d → 1_e and energy release during 1_e → 1_f are calculated as 4.30 and 81.99
kcal/mol, respectively. The produced component after the aromatic
ring saturation of 2-HB is identified as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1-carbaldehyde.
Further, the cleavage of hydroxyl group of structure 1_f is carried out with a calculated BDE of 86.57 kcal/mol, followed
by a radical recombination reaction of structure 1_g and
a hydrogen radical with an energy release of 94.49 kcal/mol. Afterward,
the produced component, i.e., cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (structure 1_h), follows two pathways. The first pathway proceeds as
the primary reaction pathway 1 (bold black arrows in Figure 1), which cleaves the formyl
group from structure 1_h with a BDE of 71.43 kcal/mol,
followed by saturation of generated radical with a hydrogen radical
releasing 94.19 kcal/mol of energy to produce cyclohexane. On the
other hand, the secondary reaction pathway 1 (nonbold black arrows
in Figure 1) involves
a decarbonylation reaction to directly produce cyclohexane. The barrier
height of the decarbonylation is calculated to be 87.31 kcal/mol.

In Figure 3, it
can be seen that the highest uphill is due to the very first hydrogenation
reaction of 2-HB, which is 4.62 kcal/mol at the potential energy surface,
and other stationary states are in the negative side. Figure 3 clearly suggests an overall
activation energy of only 4.62 kcal/mol of energy, which is a very
favorable environment for this system even at lower temperature and
pressure conditions. Also, it can be seen that the decarbonylation
reaction of structure 1_h is slightly favorable for the
direct cleavage of the formyl group followed by hydrogenation reaction.

2.3 Reaction Pathway 2
Reaction pathway
2 is about the production of cyclohexanone. The potential energy surface
is shown in Figure 4 by a blue smooth line, and the corresponding molecular structures
are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Optimized molecular structures of reaction pathway 2.

Reaction pathway 2 starts with the dihedral change
of hydrogen
atom of the hydroxyl group. It can be seen from the potential energy
surface of reaction pathway 2 (Figure 4) that 2-HB is the ground-state structure and 10.57
kcal/mol more stable than structure 2_a (energetically
less stable configuration of 2-HB). The dihedral change of hydrogen
atom occurs with a barrier height of 13.80 kcal/mol, and this reaction
step is essential for further initiation of the keto–enol tautomerization
reaction. The keto–enol tautomerization reaction step (2_a → 2_b), i.e., migration of hydrogen
atom from hydroxyl group to the ortho-positioned carbon atom, produces
6-oxocyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carbaldehyde with a barrier height of 73.90
kcal/mol. Further, a single-step hydrogenation reaction at structure 2_b is carried out with a barrier height of only 1.36 kcal/mol,
followed by combination reaction of a hydrogen radical and structure 2_c releasing 77.53 kcal/mol of energy. Further, similar to
the reaction steps 2_b → 2_c → 2_d, the reaction steps 2_d → 2_e → 2_f are performed with a barrier height of
1.75 kcal/mol for reaction step 2_d → 2_e and an energy release of 83.62 kcal/mol for reaction step 2_e → 2_f.

The produced compound
after the conversion of double bonds between
carbon atoms into single bonds is recognized as 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carbaldehyde.
Finally, to produce cyclohexanone from 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carbaldehyde,
a decarbonylation reaction is carried out, which occurs with a barrier
height of 71.04 kcal/mol.

The production of cyclohexanone from
2-hydroxybenzaldehyde witnesses
many reaction steps. It can be seen in Figure 4 that the energy state of TS2_2 is highest in the potential energy surface of reaction pathway 2;
therefore, this particular energy state will be responsible for the
overall activation energy. Therefore, the overall activation energy
of reaction pathway 2 is 84.47 kcal/mol, which is very high to achieve
at mild reaction conditions. Also, if compared, the production of
cyclohexanone requires a considerably larger overall activation barrier
(84.47 kcal/mol) than the overall activation barrier in the production
of cyclohexane (4.62 kcal/mol). Therefore, it is clear that the possibility
of production of cyclohexane from 2-HB will be considerably higher
compared to the production of cyclohexanone.

3 Conclusions
In this study, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (2-HB),
a bio-oil oxygenated
component that represents the phenolic fraction of bio-oil, is taken
as the bio-oil model compound and its ring saturation is carried out
to produce cyclohexane and cyclohexanone. The bond dissociation energy
calculations of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde do not suggest the cleavage
of hydrogen atoms from either the phenyl ring or functional groups
because of high energy requirements. Therefore, the conversion of
2-HB by ring saturation is carried out to produce cycloproducts. It
is observed that the production of cyclohexane is highly favorable
compared to the production of cyclohexanone because the overall activation
energy of the former is only 4.62 kcal/mol, whereas the latter demanded
84.47 kcal/mol of overall activation energy. In other words, keto–enol
tautomerization followed by ring hydrogenation process of 2-HB in
gas phase is not preferred compared to direct ring hydrogenation process
of 2-HB.

4 Computational Details
The application
of density functional theory (DFT) as a computational
tool has enormously increased in the recent past due to its reliability
and accuracy. Although there are various functionals under DFT, such
as LSDA, B3LYP, BLYP, M05, M06-2X, etc., there has been much debate
among researchers regarding their accuracy.25 Recently, a few research groups26,27 carried out
an extensive survey of DFT functionals applied to various chemical
systems. For instance, Goerigk et al.26 performed an extensive review to assess numerous DFT functionals
and observed ωB97X-V functional as one of the best functionals
among GGA, meta-GGA, and hybrid-GGA functionals. They reported an
average performance of B3LYP functional compared to other DFT functionals.
Furthermore, Mardirossian and Head-Gordon27 also performed an extensive assessment of numerous DFT functionals
and reported root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values for different
data types. They reported ωB97M-V as the best functional because
of low RMSD values for barrier heights (1.68) and thermochemistry
(2.48) data types. However, an interesting observation in their study
is that B3LYP functional performed excellently compared to many well-known
DFT functionals, such as PBE, PBE-D3, TPSS-D3, M06-L, and so on. In
addition, recently, Simón and Goodman28 have shown that the use of B3LYP functional is a better choice for
organic covalent bond-forming reactions; therefore, all geometries
and transition-state structures in this study are optimized using
B3LYP29,30 functional under DFT31,32 framework. The basis set has been selected as 6-311+g(d,p).33 Normal-mode vibrational frequency calculations
are carried out for all optimized structures to test the true natures
of optimized structures. One and zero imaginary frequencies in the
vibrational frequency result confirm the structure as first-order
saddle point and minimum structure on potential energy surface (PES).
Furthermore, an intrinsic reaction coordinate34 calculation is also carried out at each true transition-state structure
to evaluate the minimum energy path. The single point energy (SPE)
calculation is performed for each structure at the M06-2X/6-311+g(3df,2p)//B3LYP/6-311+g(d,p)
level of theory to predict energies accurately.

Bond dissociation
energy calculations are performed for organic
homolysis and radical recombination reactions because of the nonavailability
of transition-state structures for such reactions. BDE provides a
good approximation for the energy requirement to cleave a chemical
bond. The expression of BDE is as follows 1  where H298 is
the enthalpy. “A–B” is the molecule with considered
cleavage site, A and B are the radicals after bond cleavage of “A–B”.

All quantum chemical calculations are performed in the gas-phase
environment using Gaussian 0935 software
package with the help of a Gauss View 536 visualizer.
