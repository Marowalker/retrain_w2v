When
graphene is used as SERS substrates,
it contributes to the chemical mechanism (CM) of enhancement of Raman
signal, owing to which the detection limit is very low (lower than
mM content of probe molecules). The CM of enhancement depends largely
on the interactions between the substrate and the probe molecules.
Therefore, in this work, we have investigated the possibility of increasing
the SERS activity of graphene by improving the interaction between
the probe molecule and the graphene substrate by establishing exclusively
strong covalent bonding between them. Fluorescein (Fl) was selected
as a probe molecule because it is one of the most commonly used fluorophore
in bioscience. As a graphene substrate, reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
platelets were used. In addition, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were
added onto the hybrids to further increase the enhancement by electromagnetic
mechanism. Highly enhanced Raman signal of Fl onto neat rGO was achieved
for micromolar concentration of the probe molecules. This was attributed
to the covalent bonding between them, which introduced hole doping
to rGO, decreasing the Fermi level of rGO and bringing it more closely
to the LUMO of Fl. This induces aligning of their energy levels, resulting
in higher contribution of the nonresonance effect to the charge transfer
mechanism of enhancement, which, in this case, occurred intramolecularly.
When AgNPs were added onto the rGO substrate, the expected enhancement
performance was not observed. On the one hand, this was attributed
to small size (∼20 nm) of AgNPs and lack of aggregates and,
on the other, due to the unusually high contribution of CM determined.

==== Body
1 Introduction
One or few layers of graphene1−5 or graphene oxide (GO)4,6 have been widely used
as active substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
analysis.7,8 Graphene-based surfaces, similar to the
metallic surfaces, quench the fluorescence background of the analyte.9 Besides that, graphene-based substrates provide
a large surface area, allowing adsorption of a high number of probe
molecules.10,11 The main drawback of graphene-based
SERS substrates is that they contribute only to the chemical enhancement
(CE) of the signal; hence, the maximum enhancing factors achieved
are usually in the range of 102–104.8,10,12,13

On the other hand, fluorescein (Fl) is a xanthene dye with
a large
variety of technical applications, among them as a fluorophore in
bioscience. Owing to its large fluorescence quantum yield, low toxicity,
and high photostability, it has been used as a tracer in groundwater,
to label biological compounds, to detect corneal abrasions, and as
a dye in food, drugs, and cosmetics. However, the fluorophore performance
of Fl is sensitive to the environment in which it is used. The fluorescence
is repressed in hydrophobic environments, whereas in aqueous (polar)
environments (as the most of biological environments), it fluoresces
strongly.14 This limits the application
of Fl in biosensor devices. The combination of graphene-based substrates
with Fl probe molecules is one of the ways to successfully eliminate
the problems of both strong fluorescence background of Fl and weak
enhancement of graphene.5

When graphene
was used as a substrate for SERS, the main mechanisms
contributing to the CE of the signal are the vibrational coupling
(VC) and the charge transfer (CT) between the probe molecule and the
substrate. It was already demonstrated that the interaction of the
probe molecules and the graphene substrate determines the extent of
the enhancement.1,6 This means that the distance between
the probe molecule and the substrate and the positions of molecular
orbital (and probability of VC and CT) will be established by the
type of the interaction created between the probe molecule and the
substrate. All of the works using graphene-based substrates for SERS
measurements are based on the adsorption of the probe molecule onto
the surface of graphene platelets, resulting in low detection limit
(lower than mM concentrations) for neat graphene substrates.8−12 The attempts to improve the graphene-based SERS are focused on the
use of dendrimer morphology polymer chains13,15 or the use of Ag or Au nanoparticles in combination with graphene.16,17 In the past works, the presence of Ag or Au nanoparticles was likely
responsible for the very high enhancement achieved; hence, the detection
limits of nanomolar contents of probe molecules were reported.

In this work, we propose a new platform for graphene SERS measurements
based on the creation of covalent bonding between the probe molecule
and the substrate that is expected to principally improve the interactions
between them. In case that the optically active part of the probe
molecule is not affected while bonding, it is expected that the change
in the interface induced by bonding will increase the probabilities
for VC and CT and will result in increased contribution of the chemical
mechanism (CM) to the enhancement. For this aim, Fl molecules were
covalently attached to monolayer GO platelets by epoxy-ring-opening
reaction, followed by reduction. In this way, we have designed composite
substrates made of covalently attached Fl on the surface of reduced
GO (rGO), with the main idea of creating hybrid SERS substrates that
can be used for extrinsic SERS measurements. To increase further the
SERS activity by giving rise to electromagnetic (EM) enhancement,
we have decorated the hybrid substrate with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs),
created in situ from AgNO3 precursor that was simultaneously
reduced during GO reduction.18−22 By the synthesis of two types of substrates rGO–Fl and rGO–AgNP–Fl,
we created a base for the comparative study of CM versus combined
CM and EM enhancements. As a result, the neat graphene substrates
with covalently attached Fl have shown unusually higher enhancement
than that reported for pristine graphene with adsorbed probe molecules.

2 Results and Discussion
Attachment of Fl onto the GO
surface (Scheme 1)
was carried out by the reaction of nucleophilic
substitution, where the C–O bond in epoxy functionalities present
on the basal plane of GO23 was broken by
the attack of a weak nucleophile—Fl molecule under acidic conditions
(pH = 4.3) and increased temperature (60 °C). As a result, covalent
bonding of Fl onto the GO surface took place. The synthesis procedure
is presented schematically in Figure 1, whereas the synthesis conditions and samples’
nomenclature are presented in Table 1.

Scheme 1 Covalent Attachment of Fl Molecules on the Surface
of GO Platelets
Covalent attachment
of Fl onto the GO platelets was demonstrated
by UV and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analyses
of the thoroughly cleaned samples by 5 + 2 subsequent centrifugations,
during which it was supposed that the not attached Fl was removed
from the samples. Aggregated and restacked GO platelets were simultaneously
eliminated, resulting in exclusively one layer of Fl-modified GO platelets
(Fl–GO), as demonstrated later by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses. After the Fl attachment,
the Fl–GO was reduced to Fl–rGO. A part of the Fl–GO
platelets were decorated with AgNPs by simultaneous reduction of GO
and AgNO3 by AsA. It was previously reported that oxygen-containing
functional groups of carbon materials adsorb Ag+ by means
of electrostatic interaction and the adsorbed ions are reduced at
the surface of the material.24,25 Therefore, the simultaneous
reduction of Fl–GO and AgNO3 was expected to result
in the formation of hybrid Fl–rGO sheets decorated with strongly
adsorbed AgNPs (Fl–rGO–Ag). The reduction was performed
at two different temperatures (25 and 60 °C) to investigate the
effect of temperature on the AgNP size, aggregation, interactions
with rGO sheets, and morphology.

As shown in Figure 2, where the
ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
spectra of the hybrid sheets are presented, the spectra of GO (Figure 2a) display a strong
absorption band at 237 nm (attributed to π–π* transitions
of aromatic C=C bonds) and a shoulder band at around 300 nm
(attributed to n−π* transitions of C=O bonds).
The Fl dye exhibits several absorption bands at 490, 328, 285, and
239 nm (Figure 2b).26 The presence of the 490 nm band in the Fl–rGO(60)
and Fl–rGO(25) samples after thorough purification clearly
indicates the attachment of Fl onto the GO sheets.

of the synthesis of Fl–rGO and Fl–rGO–AgNP
hybrid dispersions.

Figure 2 UV spectra of (a) GO;
(b) Fl; (c) Fl–rGO(25); and (d) Fl–rGO(25).

The growth of AgNPs onto the graphene sheets is
manifested by the
presence of the new peak at around 440 nm, assigned to the surface
plasmon resonance absorption band of Ag. The observed red shift from
237 to 270 nm and the shoulder band disappearance at around 300 nm
in the spectra of Fl–rGO(60) and Fl–rGO(25) samples
indicate revival of the conjugated C=C bonds as a result of
GO reduction (Figure 2c,d). It is worth mentioning that the spectrum (c) in Figure 2, owing to the appearance of
a broad band without clear peaks, was measured few times on repeatedly
prepared samples, and the same spectra were observed in all cases.
We attribute this band to the irregular AgNP growth and distribution
along the graphene platelets and the interactions between them. In
addition, there is an overlapping with the 490 nm peak corresponding
to Fl.

The indications obtained by the analysis of the UV–vis
spectra
are confirmed by FTIR spectra, presented in Figure 3, where the characteristic bands of GO are
presented: 1725 cm–1 attributed to stretching vibration
of C=O, 1636 cm–1 attributed to skeletal
vibration of unoxidized graphene domains, 1395 cm–1 attributed to O–H deformation vibrations of C–OH,
and 1056 cm–1 attributed to the epoxy group (C–O–C).25,27 In Figure 3i, the
established bonding of GO and Fl is confirmed: after the reaction,
the C–O–C groups (peak 1056 cm–1, Figure 3i, spectrum a) from
GO disappeared, so it is not present in the Fl–GO sample (Figure 3i, spectrum b). It
has been demonstrated by theoretical calculations that the epoxy and
hydroxyl functionalities are stable on GO up to 70 °C and even
contribute toward stabilization of GO,28 which means that the complete loss of the characteristic peak of
epoxy functionalities in GO during the reaction demonstrates the chemical
bonding. Owing to the aromatic structure of Fl, there is a possibility
of establishing a π–π bond with GO. However, no
indications for that were observed.

Figure 3 FTIR spectra of [i(a)] Fl, [i(b)] GO,
and [i(c)] Fl–rGO(25)
and [ii(a)] Fl, [ii(b)] GO, [ii(c)] Fl–rGO–Ag(25), and
[ii(d)] Fl–rGO–Ag(60).

Furthermore, the characteristic peaks for Fl, centered at
1243
and 1211 cm–1 (C–O–C stretch of xanthenes
ring),29 were slightly shifted in the spectra
of Fl–GO hybrid toward lower wavenumbers, confirming changes
in the chemical environment of Fl, likely provoked by the attachment
of Fl onto GO. In Figure 3ii, where the samples after simultaneous reduction of GO and
AgNO3 are presented, the same indications are obvious (Figure 3ii spectra c and
d).

The structure and morphology of the hybrids obtained under
different
reaction conditions were investigated by TEM. In Figure 4a, the neat rGO platelet deposited
from polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized aqueous dispersions is
shown. In Figure 4b,
the rGO platelets with attached Fl are presented. The hybrid structures
are made of wrinkled and bent platelets decorated with small black
hills probably made of some graphitic structures, from which a kind
of neuron wrinkles emerge. In addition, the presence of grayish organic
matter is noticeable, not presented in neat rGO (Figure 4a), hence attributed to the
Fl dye. The same morphology is kept after the addition of AgNPs, which
can be noticed as black spherical nanoparticles deposited on the top
of the platelets (Figure 4c–f). The influence of reduction conditions on the
morphology becomes obvious, by comparing Figure 4c,d (reduction performed at 25 °C/72
h) with Figure 4e,f
(reduction performed at 60 °C/4 h). At lower temperature, AgNPs
are deposited in higher number and with minor size, observed as black
dots with size <10 nm dispersed over the platelets (Figure 4d). The plausible reason for
this can be the faster reduction reaction at an increased temperature30 that leads to rapidly growing particles and
their clustering before they were reached by the PVP stabilizer. Therefore,
as shown in Figure 4f, the AgNP size in the samples reduced at 60 °C is >20 nm.
Nevertheless, as theoretical and experimental studies have shown,
the optimal particle size for the strongest SERS enhancement is observed for nanoparticles with the size of
20–70 nm.22,31

a Ratios were calculated with respect
to the content of GO in the initial dispersion.

As the surface properties and the
morphology are of extreme interest
for SERS activity, the samples were analyzed by AFM, and the results
are presented in Figure 5. Lateral dimensions of rGO platelets are within a range of 500 nm
to 3 μm, with an observed average of 1.1 ± 0.5 μm.
The images show overlapping of the individual rGO layers, which most
likely results from the method employed to prepare the samples. The
observed single-layer rGO platelets have significantly higher thickness
than the one found in the literature for graphene that is close to
0.7 nm32 and higher than that of the neat
rGO platelets stabilized with PVP (2 nm31). The average thickness of some of the samples is presented in Table 2.

The layer thickness
indicates either a partial reduction of GO
or it comes from the presence of PVP on the surface of the platelets,
as demonstrated previously.33 The covalently
attached Fl additionally contributes to the increased thickness observed.
Moreover, it generates agglomerates on the surface of the platelets
that increase their roughness as can be observed in Figure 5b, where a phase image of the
Fl-coated rGO is presented [sample Fl–rGO(25)]. Owing to the
very small dimensions of the AgNPs, it is almost impossible to observe
them in Figure 5; although
by comparing Figure 5c,d, the effect of reduction conditions on the morphology becomes
clear. The hybrids containing AgNPs present slightly lower thickness,
indicating that the subsequent reduction reactions performed at different
temperatures and in the presence or absence of AgNO3 influence
the amount of Fl. To explain this phenomenon, we hypothesize that
attachment of Fl was not stoichiometric because of the high tendency
of Fl to form aggregates;34 thus, instead
of single molecules, these aggregates were covalently attached to
the GO surface. After the addition of AsA for the subsequent reduction,
there is disaggregation owing to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between
Fl and AsA and later on, loss of the disaggregated Fl molecules occurred
during purification. The effect of disaggregation is highly accelerated
by the presence of AgNPs that results even in lower Fl contents attached
to the GO surface, an effect that is always observed and reported.34

2.1 SERS Activity of Fl–rGO
and Fl–rGO–Ag
Substrates
Figure 6 presents the Raman spectra of the blank samples, prepared
for comparison with the hybrid substrates. Raman spectrum of GO with
its characteristic D band at around 1348 cm–1 (originated
from the defects in carbon atoms) and the G band at around 1600 cm–1 (corresponding to the ordered sp2 in plane
vibration of carbon atoms35,36) is presented in Figure 6a. Figure 6b shows the Raman spectrum
of Fl on Si substrates, where the intensive fluorescence is obvious
and the skeletal vibration modes of the xanthene moiety appear in
the frequency range from 1000 to 1800 cm–1.29

Figure 6 Raman spectra of (a) GO (0.5 mg GO/mL dispersion), (b)
Fl (3.33
mg Fl/mL dispersion), (c) Fl–GO (3.33 mg/mL), and (d) Fl–rGO
blend (3.33 mg/mL).

Raman spectrum of a hybrid
substrate made of Fl–GO presents
only the characteristic D and G peaks of GO (Figure 6c). This indicates that GO reduction is necessary
to induce SERS activity, as it was reported previously.6 Finally, the simple blend of Fl with rGO was
prepared by mixing a solution of Fl with the previously reduced GO
(under the same conditions as used in rGO–Fl, with a ratio
of 1:1 in weight between Fl and GO). Since, in this case, Fl molecules
were expected to be only adsorbed onto rGO platelets, this will demonstrate
the importance of bonding between the probe-molecule and the substrate. Figure 6d presents the Raman
spectrum of this sample, where the Fl characteristic peaks appear
simultaneously with the D and G peaks of the rGO substrate. In comparison
to the Fl spectrum on the Si substrate (Figure 6b), the fluorescence is decreased significantly.

In Figure 7, the
Raman spectra of the hybrid samples are presented. The slight shift
was observed on the Raman signals in all spectra respective to the
spectrum of the free Fl molecules in Figure 6b. This shift is attributed to the covalent
bonding between Fl and GO, and the shape (sharp and narrow) of the
peaks verifies the absence of free Fl molecules, as one may expect
broad peaks from the contribution of both Fl free and Fl attached
molecules. Furthermore, significant enhancement has been observed
for all hybrids, except for Fl–rGO(60), where the rGO characteristic
peaks are dominating in the spectrum (Figure 7b). The influence of the synthesis conditions
is quite noticeable. The hybrids obtained by reduction at 25 °C
for 72 h (Figure 7a,c),
in general, present much better Raman spectra of Fl than the ones
reduced at 60 °C for 4 h (Figure 7b,d).

Figure 7 Raman spectra of (d) Fl–rGO(25), (e) Fl–rGO(60),
(f) Fl–rGO–AgNP(25), and (g) Fl–rGO–AgNP(60).
The arrows show the peak at 1492 cm–1, corresponding
to Fl that was used for comparison of the performance.

The bad performance of Fl–rGO(60) is attributed
to the nonuniform
distribution of Fl along rGO platelets as it may be observed in the
TEM images (Figure 4b), where neat rGO areas not covered with grayish organic matter
is noticeable. In the case of Fl–rGO(25), Fl is well-distributed
along the whole platelets, which is in good agreement with the AFM
images in Figure 5a,b.
In addition, it seems that, in presence of AgNPs, lower amount of
Fl was present in the samples, as concluded from the determined thicknesses
of the samples by AFM. On the other hand, in the samples containing
AgNPs, as presented in TEM images, the AgNPs were smaller in size
(<10 nm) and better dispersed throughout the platelets when obtained
under mild reduction conditions (Figure 4c,d), which obviously is more prosperous
to the SERS activity than the irregular distribution of larger AgNPs.
Furthermore, the particle size of AgNPs obtained at 60 °C, which
is around 20 nm, is still too tiny for a proper Raman enhancement
(Figure 4e,f). With
all this in mind, only the Raman spectra of hybrid samples reduced
at 25 °C will be taken into account for the discussions of the
achieved enhancement.

To study the effect of the CE versus the
CE accompanied by EM of
the hybrid samples, nondecorated Fl–rGO(25) platelets (Figure 7a) and Fl–rGO–Ag(25)
platelets decorated with AgNPs (Figure 7c) were compared. To calculate the enhancement factor,37 a precisely determined content of attached Fl
is needed. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) measurements were used
for this aim; however, we were able to determine only the Fl content
within the samples that do not contain AgNPs. The probable reason
for that could be the enhanced combustion of rGO-containing AgNPs.
Owing to the high heat conductivity of AgNPs, it acts as a heat sink
and makes the transfer of heat within the samples more efficient.
It was determined by TGA that Fl concentration in the samples Fl–rGO(25)
and Fl–rGO(60) was around 3 × 10–6 mol/L,
with a small difference of 5% between them, which is rather expectable
because of the temperature differences in the reduction of GO and
the possible manual errors that can be made during the purification
step by centrifugation.

In such conditions of lack of the precise
values for the attached
Fl in all samples, their SERS performance was evaluated by comparison
of the normalized values of the intensities of Fl characteristic peak
centered at 1492 cm–1 (pointed by black arrows in Figure 7). The intensity
of the peaks was normalized using the intensity of the characteristic
peak of silicon wafer, centered at about 520 cm–1, as a reference. Values of 2.26 and 9.43 were obtained for Fl–rGO(25)
and Fl–rGO–Ag(25), respectively, whereas, for the neat
Fl sample (deposited on Si substrate), it was 1.49. Having in mind
that the content of the attached Fl onto hybrid samples is at the
micromolar level and that of neat Fl is at the millimolar level, obviously
very high enhancement by the hybrid substrates was achieved for both.

On the other hand, the CE observed for the Fl–rGO(25) sample
in Figure 7a is only
four times inferior than the combined enhancement observed for the
Fl–rGO–Ag(25) sample, where the additional contribution
of the EM is present. Usually this difference is much higher. For
example, as reported for the methylene blue probe molecule adsorbed
onto the rGO surface decorated with AgNPs, the Raman intensity was
350 times higher than that obtained onto the rGO surface.10 The reason for so diminutive contribution of
EM observed in our samples is due to the very small size of the AgNPs
incorporated in the hybrid structures (<10 nm, Figure 4d) and the absence of AgNP
aggregates and clusters onto the rGO, as shown in the TEM images (Figure 4c,d). This eliminates
the possibility of hot spot creation, which is known to bring large
EM enhancement.38,39 On the other hand, the difference
was further lowered by the unusually high CE achieved for the Fl–rGO(25)
sample, which allows a very clear identification of micromolar Fl
contents. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the lowest
concentration of a probe molecule for which an excellent Raman fingerprint
spectrum was achieved using neat rGO as a substrate. Reported values
of a detection limit of probe molecules on rGO are in millimolar ranges
and refer to the identification of the probe molecule. Usually, good
spectra are achieved for a much higher probe molecule content.10 The remarkable Raman enhancement observed for
Fl–rGO(25) is associated with the introduced bonding between
the probe molecule and rGO substrate, which is the unique difference
between our work and the works reported in the literature (referenced
previously). It is well-known that graphene substrate exclusively
offers CE and that three different effects contribute to it: nonresonance
chemical probe molecule–substrate interactions, CT transitions
between the molecule and the substrate, and resonance effect of the
incident light and molecular transitions (overlapping of the molecular
orbital between the molecule and the substrate).40

We hypothesized that owing to the covalent bonds
between the probe
molecules and the rGO substrate, all mechanisms contribute to the
significant enhancement achieved. By the covalent attachment of Fl,
the proximity of the Fl molecules to the rGO surface and their positioning
obviously facilitate the CT, which is the intramolecular CT in this
case. By comparison of Raman spectra of Fl in Figures 6b and 7, a blue shift
of the Fl characteristic peaks onto SERS substrates is determined,
which is a piece of evidence for the electron CT in the direction
from Fl to rGO. This is consistent with hole-doped graphene that yields
larger Raman-enhanced signal, as demonstrated by Hao et al.40 As the xanthene ring in Fl connected through
the oxygen bond to the rGO structure is an electron acceptor, one
could accept that the proximity of it will introduce a hole-doping
in rGO. By comparing the spectra of hybrid samples and that of GO
(Figures 6a and 7), the hole-doping of rGO in the hybrids is proven
by the upshift of the G peak in the doped samples.41 On the other hand, the hole doping induces a decrease in
the Fermi level of graphene,40 making it
aligned with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of Fl
and giving rise to the contribution of the nonresonance effect to
the overall enhancement achieved. Additionally, the resonance effect
could be increased if a kind of tuning of molecular resonance relative
to the wavelength of the incident light occurred.40

We do not have any further experimental evidence
to confirm the
hypothesis and to determine the exact mechanism. Further experiments
combined with theoretical calculations can help to elucidate it; however,
it is beyond the scope of the presented work.

3 Conclusions
Two types of hybrid samples based on covalently
attached Fl onto
rGO platelets with and without AgNPs were developed and tested as
SERS substrates for extrinsic SERS measurements. The main idea was
to improve the interactions between the substrate (rGO) and the probe
molecule (Fl) that may lead toward improving the contribution of rGO,
that is, chemical-enhancing mechanism to the overall enhancement.

The Fl attachment to GO was successfully performed by epoxy-ring-opening
reaction, followed by GO or GO–AgNO3 reduction at
two different temperatures (25 and 60 °C). The changes were monitored
by UV–vis and the attachment was proven by FTIR spectroscopy.
The hybrid platelets were characterized by means of TEM and AFM imaging,
and the quantity of the dye attached onto the rGO sheets was estimated
from the TGA measurements.

It was demonstrated that the reduction
conditions, such as temperature
or time, were relevant when obtaining rGO substrates with uniformly
distributed Fl molecules, since the covalent bonding of Fl to rGO
was not stoichiometric.

Almost all hybrid samples presented
high enhancement of the Raman
signal of Fl, with a superior effect obtained from the substrates
reduced under mild conditions (25 °C) during longer time. By
comparison of the intensity of the Fl-characteristic peak centered
around 1490 cm–1, the performance of the neat rGO
and rGO decorated with AgNP hybrids were compared, giving further
details about CM versus the combined CM with EM mechanisms of enhancement.
The combined mechanism of enhancement was only fourfold higher than
CM owing, on the one hand, to the lower than expected EM contribution
of the presence of AgNPs because of the very small size of the nanoparticles
and absence of aggregates. On the other hand, the small difference
observed between CM and combined mechanism was attributed to very
high CE induced by rGO owing to the covalently attached Fl, which
allow much better interactions between rGO and Fl. Chemical attachment
of Fl onto rGO induced the hole doping of rGO, decreasing the Fermi
level of rGO close to the LUMO of Fl. This alignment of their energy
levels resulted in increased contribution of nonresonance effect to
the CT mechanism of enhancement.

The developed hybrid materials
create a base for development of
unique biosensor because by association of the substrate with biomolecules
of interest, the SERS spectrum of the tag (Fl) can be used for sensing
and quantification.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
GO aqueous dispersion with
concentration of 5 mg/mL composed mainly of 1–3 layered platelets
(60% is one layer) was purchased from Graphene supermarket HC. Fl
(Fl, C20H12O5, Fluka); PVP (C6H9NO)n with Mw = 29 000 (PVP, Aldrich); silver nitrate
(AgNO3, Aldrich); and l-(+)-ascorbic acid, 99%, Mw = 176, 13 (AsA, ACROS) were used as received
without further purification.

4.2 Methods
Schematically, the whole
preparation procedure of aqueous hybrid dispersion of Fl–rGO
and Fl–rGO–Ag is presented in Figure 1.

4.2.1 Covalent Attachment of
Fl onto GO
Methanol solution of Fl (15 mL, concentration
3333 mg/mL) was added
into 100 mL of diluted aqueous dispersion of GO (0.5 mg/mL, pH 4.3).
PVP (1 wt %) with respect to GO was added as a stabilizing agent to
prevent aggregation of the platelets after reduction.

The dispersions
were stirred at 60 °C overnight during which epoxy-ring-opening
was expected to occur and initiate the reaction with the hydroxyl
group of Fl, resulting in a covalent attachment of Fl onto graphene
sheets. To remove the unattached Fl, the dispersions were then centrifuged
(five times at 10 000 rpm at 20 °C, each lasting 15 min)
and washed with de-ionized water.

4.2.2 Reduction
of Fl–GO and/or Fl–GO–AgNO3
After the covalent attachment of Fl to the surface
of GO, 20 mL of the purified dispersions were reduced by adding 1
mL AsA solution (100 mg/mL). In the case of Fl–rGO–Ag,
prior to the reduction process, 1 mL of AgNO3 aqueous solution
(6 mg/mL) was added and the reductions of both GO and AgNO3 proceeded simultaneously. The reduction was carried out by stirring
at two different conditions: 4 h at 60 °C and 72 h at 25 °C.
The Fl–rGO and Fl–rGO–Ag dispersions were then
centrifuged twice at 15 000 rpm for 70 min in total.

4.3 Characterization
Chemical changes
in the structure of graphene platelets as a result of the reduction
of GO and AgNO3 as well as covalent attachment of Fl on
GO sheets were investigated by the UV–vis Shimadzu UV-2550
spectrometer with the wavelength range from 200 to 900 nm. Successful
reduction of GO was demonstrated by the disappearance of the shoulder
band at 300 nm (C=O) and red shift from 230 to 270 nm of the
strong absorption band of C=C. Appearance of the new band at
about 440 nm in UV spectra is because of the surface plasmon resonance
that corresponds to the excitation of AgNPs, which confirms the presence
of AgNPs in the samples. FTIR spectra were recorded on an ALPHA coupled
to a Golden Gate single attenuated total reflection unit. The variation
in the intensities of characteristic bands of the C–O–C
moiety at 1056 cm–1 in the spectra of GO and at
1243 cm–1 in the spectra of hybrid samples was followed
as an indication of introduced chemical modifications.

The TGA
was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere (25 mL/min flow rate) using
a TGA Discovery 5500 analyzer (TA instruments). The samples were equilibrated
at 100 °C for 20 min and then heated at a rate of 10 °C/min,
in the range from 100 to 800 °C. For the calculation of the concentration
of Fl within rGO in a hybrid sample (Fl–rGO), the TGA of rGO
(PVP containing) and Fl samples were measured as blank samples. It
is worthy to mention that the blank rGO was obtained following all
steps for Fl–rGO preparation, to eliminate the possibilities
of influencing the composition of rGO by the procedures. Very briefly,
1 wt % of PVP with respect to GO was added to 100 mL of diluted aqueous
dispersion of GO. The dispersion was stirred at 60 °C overnight
and then centrifuged (five times at 10 000 rpm at 20 °C,
each lasting 15 min) and washed with deionized water. Purified dispersion
(20 mL) was reduced by the addition of 1 mL of AsA solution (100 mg/mL),
and rGO was centrifuged twice at 15 000 rpm for 70 min in total.
The attached Fl concentration was calculated gravimetrically, using
a system of equations in which the relative loss of each compound
is taken into account.

The structure of the rGO platelets and
the distribution of AgNPs
decorated onto rGO surfaces were investigated with a Philips Tecnai
G2 20 TWIN transmission electron microscope, using copper grids (300
mesh copper grids, Aldrich) with spin coating at 1500 rpm.

AFM
images were obtained by a MultiMode NanoScope IV (Veeco) instrument,
working under a tapping mode with the use of TESP tips to determine
the thickness and roughness of the sheets of Fl–rGO and Fl–rGO–Ag
hybrid structures. The samples were drop-casted on a mica substrate.

The Raman scattering and SERS activity of GO, Fl–rGO, and
Fl–rGO–Ag nanocomposite structures were investigated
using Raman spectroscopy with a Renishaw inVia spectrometer with an
excitation wavelength of 532 nm, 1% of laser power (0.2 mW), 1 s acquisition
time, and the illumination range was set from 100 to 3500 cm–1. Samples were imaged using a 100× long-working distance objective
lens and a charge-coupled device (CCD512) camera. A drop (0.05 μL)
of the sample was deposited onto a silicon wafer, which was covered
and left to dry overnight at room temperature. The silicon wafer was
previously washed by isopropanol and then maintained in an ozone preheated
camera for 15 min to remove any organic residues left.
