We present the synthesis of nylon-12
scaffolds by 3D printing and
demonstrate their versatility as matrices for cell growth, differentiation,
and biomineral formation. We demonstrate that the porous nature of
the printed parts makes them ideal for the direct incorporation of
preformed nanomaterials or material precursors, leading to nanocomposites
with very different properties and environments for cell growth. Additives
such as those derived from sources such as tetraethyl orthosilicate
applied at a low temperature promote successful cell growth, due partly
to the high surface area of the porous matrix. The incorporation of
presynthesized iron oxide nanoparticles led to a material that showed
rapid heating in response to an applied ac magnetic field, an excellent
property for use in gene expression and, with further improvement,
chemical-free sterilization. These methods also avoid changing polymer
feedstocks and contaminating or even damaging commonly used selective
laser sintering printers. The chemically treated 3D printed matrices
presented herein have great potential for use in addressing current
issues surrounding bone grafting, implants, and skeletal repair, and
a wide variety of possible incorporated material combinations could
impact many other areas.

1 Introduction
Additive
manufacturing, or three-dimensional (3D) printing, presents
a number of interesting avenues for composite material manufacture
beyond mostly monolithic prototyping because of the various stepwise
methods of material deposition and processing employed at micron scale
accuracy in a 3D space.

Current research covers a wide range
of materials, biomaterials,
and device development including wearable sensors,1 scaffolds for tissue engineering,2−4 biomimetic materials,5 graphene aerogels,6 autonomic structures,7,8 soft composites,9,10 preceramics,11,12 magnetic materials,13,14 and the direct printing of biological material.15−17

Selective
laser sintering (SLS) is a form of additive manufacturing
that uses a heated chamber, a roller feed system, and a laser to fuse
plastic, metal, or ceramic powder layers together to form a wide variety
of solid objects. Unfused powder provides support for parts, as opposed
to other printing methods that restrict model geometry or require
removable supports. This process also gives printed objects a rough
surface of partially fused powder, which, together with the biocompatibility
of the material feedstocks, provides a viable avenue to fabricate
a wide variety of effective high-surface area substrates for biomedical
implants and tissue engineering.18,19 A schematic
of the SLS process is given in Figure 1.

Figure 1 SLS schematic and process parameters.

The ability to print on-demand materials of custom shape,
dimension,
and properties presents an opportunity to address currently unmet
clinical needs in bone replacement. Large defects or voids in bones
caused, for example, by trauma or surgical removal of tumors will
not spontaneously regenerate in adults without further treatment to
bridge the missing tissue. Traditionally, this has been achieved using
bone graft taken from elsewhere in the patient or from a donor.20 However, this treatment has several limitations,
including the significant risk of morbidity at the site from which
donor bone grafts are removed, the potential for immune rejection
or transfer of pathogens in the case of allogeneic grafting, and the
insufficient supply of donor bone grafts to meet current demands.21,22 Through the development of appropriate synthetic implantable bone
biomaterials, it is becoming possible to encourage regrowth and provide
structural support without the use of donated biological tissue, thereby
increasing supply and avoiding many of the risks presented by current
methods.

The durability and strength of any kind of bone implant
depends
on both the mechanical properties of the implant material and the
level of osseointegration at the bone–implant interface. Polymer
SLS parts, specifically fabricated from the polyamide nylon-12, are
thought to provide a highly suitable material for these devices because
of the biocompatibility of nylon-12 and the SLS printing process leaving
a highly porous surface, giving a high surface area for any modification
and cell development.23 Mixing of the polymer
or metal feedstocks with other materials such as the bone mineral
hydroxyapatite24 and shape memory alloy
nitinol25 has been investigated to create
more bioactive bone implant surfaces, which can create strong and
durable implants because of the porous topology of the SLS print.26 Stem cell behavior has also been shown to be
highly influenced by the porosity of SLS parts.27,28

The mechanical properties and surface porosity of SLS-printed
parts
are affected and can be tuned by altering a number of process parameters,
such as layer height, stepping resolution, chamber temperature, laser
speed, power, focus, and pulse length.29,30 Increasing
the layer height and hatching distance increases the porosity of the
parts and reduces the hardness and density of the parts.31 Although many of these parameters currently
remain hard to control and modify dynamically to outperform the material
in the bulk form in many applications,32 there is obviously much interest in the control of surface porosity
for integration with other materials, particularly for stem cell-based
bioactive composites.16,19,33

Stem cell proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation on
materials
are affected by the 3D morphology, topology,34 and interconnectivity4 of their immediate
environment. This, in turn, means that the chemistry of, and the biochemistry
at, the material surface is of paramount importance.35 For example, the hydrophobicity of polymer objects means
that initial cell adhesion is insufficient in many cases, which is
of critical importance in bone implants.36

Silanization of surfaces with monolayers37,38 and 3D porous networks39 has been shown
to increase cell adhesion and activity, with various sol–gel
and porous bioglass substrates based on titania and silica been shown
to increase growth, proliferation, osteoblast differentiation, and
bone formation.40,41 These factors can also be affected
by the nanoporosity of bioglass,42 addition
of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles,43 and
repeated heating.41 Similarly, the addition
of magnetic nanoparticles to a polymer deposition 3D printed system
has been shown to increase proliferation and osteogenesis-related
gene expression.44 The main precursors
of hydroxyapatite, calcium, and phosphate have also been shown to
form on the surface of sol–gel-derived titania-modified titanium
surfaces when immersed in simulated body fluid.45

Much work on surface modification has focused on
mainly planar
surfaces and cultures, despite their natural topology in vivo, with
cell viability being much higher and stresses being much lower in
3D cultures.34,46 The 3D fabrication of scaffolds
has also been shown to be one of the only ways to create the correct
porosity and stiffness required to promote the desired bone density
gradients.47

With these facts in
mind, there is a strong case for investigating
the combination of relevant sol–gel surface modifications and
the printing of 3D porous nylon structures via SLS to create new bone
implant surfaces. The fabrication of these composites also invites
the easy addition of a number of additives, such as biomineral and/or
magnetic nanomaterials, for improved mineralization and heating properties,
respectively. Furthermore, the low reactivity of many of the materials
and methods described herein means that the chemical treatment, nanomaterial
addition, and printing process steps can be combined, which is the
subject of future investigation.

We demonstrate that not only
can we grow materials within porous
3D printed surfaces from chemical precursors at low temperatures for
cell growth (i.e., lower than the melting point of the substrate)
but we can also incorporate preformed nanomaterials in the form of
magnetic nanoparticles. Magnetic nanoparticles are of great interest
for biomedical applications because of the hyperthermic heating effect
when subjected to an ac magnetic field of sufficient strength and
frequency, enabling the delivery of various therapeutic agents with
increased drug efficacy.48 Hyperthermic
heating of nanoparticles within solid matrices is an area which is
underexplored save heating up waxes for drug delivery49,50,72 and has the potential to be effective
in catalysis and preventing the leading cause of implant failure,
bacterial infection in implants51 (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Scheme of the work presented
herein.

The printing of a number of parts
via SLS and the subsequent low-temperature
modification of the porous surface with silane or titania sol–gels,
hydrophobic treatment, or magnetic nanoparticle incorporation demonstrate
the versatility of our 3D printed materials and hint at the considerable
potential of chemically modified 3D printed materials for multifunctional
devices in medicine.

paper can be seen in Figure 3.

2.1 Chemical Treatment of 3D
Printed Substrates
Chemically treating nylon-12 frameworks
is very facile, insofar
as a variety of sols and solutions of known material precursors were
prepared, with emphasis on low-temperature synthesis (to retain the
nylon-12 framework), biocompatibility, and cost effectiveness. Therefore,
we used tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(APTES) for SiO2, titanium(IV) butoxide and a TiO2 “sol” for TiO2, and a 50:50 v/v mixture
of TEOS and titanium(IV) butoxide for a SiO2/TiO2 mix. Nylon-12 frameworks were first washed with ethanol to remove
any contaminants from the 3D printing process, before total immersion
into one of the aforementioned solutions for 48 h. To form the material,
the coated framework was dried in an oven at 90 °C (mp of nylon-12
is 178–180 °C) for 2 weeks to minimize any unreacted precursors
remaining. Before cell growth was attempted, the frameworks were gently
stirred for 24 h and left immersed in ethanol for 1 week to remove
any unreacted alkoxide species and alkyl products of the hydrolysis
reactions.

Metal alkoxides such as TEOS and titanium(IV) butoxide
react with water to form the corresponding metal oxide through hydrolysis
followed by condensation.55,56 At low temperatures,
these materials are noncrystalline and therefore differ from impregnated
nylon-12 frameworks with preformed crystalline nanomaterials. However,
the advantage of growing materials from molecular precursors in situ
is that the loading of the material can be increased when compared
to incorporating much larger preformed materials, therefore increasing
the surface availability of potentially biocompatible materials.

2.2 Physical Characterization of Treated 3D Printed
Substrates
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to
examine the morphology of the frameworks, shown in Figure 4. From the way in which the
nylon-12 is cured, it is clear from SEM analysis that a fractured
and fissured surface is created, which gives the appearance of porosity,
with nylon beads of ca. 30–50 μm constituting the bulk
of the surface (Figure 4a). Frameworks treated with titania precursors gave a fractured angular
surface, typical of TiO2 sols, in particular sols based
on titanium(IV) butoxide (Figure 4b–d).53,54,57,58

Figure 4 Scanning electron micrographs of (a) 3D
printed nylon-12 mesh showing
the fractured macroporous structure and 3D printed nylon-12 framework
treated with (b) a TiO2 sol, (c) titanium(IV) butoxide–TEOS
mix, (d) titanium(IV) butoxide, (e) TEOS, and (f) (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane.

The silica-coated frameworks varied
slightly, with TEOS producing
a much smoother coating than the titania, with the original surface
morphology of the printed polymer clearly visible due to the mostly
unfused 30–50 μm nylon-12 particulates from the powder
feedstock. The APTES coating showed evidence of a much finer porous
structure. At higher magnification (Figure S1), it is evident that the surface has a rough morphology, leading
to a greater surface area and therefore more sites of attachment for
cell growth.

The potential for porosity and the importance of
a large surface
area for cell attachment59 led us to investigate
the properties of the treated 3D printed frameworks with Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) gas sorption analysis. The BET surface areas (SABET) in m2 g–1 are summarized in Table 1. It is noteworthy
that the samples under scrutiny were at the upper instrument limit
of detection for BET; therefore; they did not exhibit micro- or mesoporosity,
and hence “negative” values are obtained, as seen in Table 1. However, trends
are still observable and can be tallied directly to the chemical modifications
made to the nylon-12 frameworks. Silica-modified samples showed a
much smaller increase in SABET than those with titania,
which is commensurate with the SEM images, as the APTES and TEOS-treated
samples exhibited more features of the unmodified nylon-12 sample
than the titania-modified samples. Combining both TEOS and titanium(IV)
butoxide resulted in an increased SABET, combining features
from both silica and titania. The TiO2 sol-treated sample
gave marginally the highest surface area, which is one of the reasons
that it is an excellent precursor for highly photocatalytically active
titania particles and coatings.

a Note that the untreated

sample was hydrophilic and absorbed the water droplet.

In terms of composition and to show
that the frameworks were impregnated
with the desired materials, they were analyzed using energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
EDS analysis (shown in Figure S2) for the
untreated nylon-12 framework showed the presence of solely carbon
and oxygen, which is expected. Indeed, EDS spectra of the chemically
treated samples showed the presence of the required elements (i.e.,
silicon and titanium), albeit in smaller quantities than C and O from
the parent framework.

XPS spectra were recorded for all samples
at every stage of the
process, that is, prior to chemical treatment, after chemical treatment,
and after cell growth. In particular, we were interested to see whether
the chemical treatment had been effective and whether cells could
grow and potentially differentiate to form hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2). Therefore,
high-resolution spectra were taken of C 1s, N 1s, Ca 2p, Ti 2p, P
2p, O 1s, and Si 2p of all samples. All samples showed the presence
of the chemical treatment and showed evidence of the presence of hydroxyapatite
after cell growth and differentiation with a huge increase in concentration
and a small shift in binding energy (Figure 5 and Table S1,
detailed explanation vide infra).

nylon-12 tablet treated
with a 50:50 mixture of titanium(IV) butoxide and TEOS. (a) Ca 2p
spectrum showing the sample before (bottom) and after (top) stem cell
differentiation. Binding energy values of 347.2 eV for the Ca 2p3/2 and 352.7 eV for Ca 2p1/2 are in good agreement
with the literature for hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) (60). (b) Corresponding P 2p spectrum
with binding energy values of 133.1 eV (P 2p3/2) and 133.9
(P 2p1/2). (c) Si 2p high-resolution scan for the titanium(IV)
butoxide and TEOS-treated tablet before (bottom) and after cell differentiation
(top). The lower signal obtained after differentiation is attributed
to the overgrowth of hydroxyapatite onto the substrate. (d) Ti 2p
high-resolution spectra before (bottom) and after (top) cell differentiation.

Interestingly, the nylon-12 itself
did contain traces of silicon,
phosphorus, and calcium. This is likely due to small amounts of flow
improver additive added to the feedstock powder. Binding energy values
of 132.9 eV for P 2p3/2 and 346.9 eV for Ca 2p3/2 and indeed the quantities were in contrast to those seen for the
differentiated cells, as illustrated for the titanium(IV) butoxide
and TEOS-treated sample in Figure 5. The nitrogen 1s environment gave a single environment
at 399.5 eV, assigned as C–NH from the polymer.60 The binding energy value for Si 2p3/2 was 102.0 eV, which was in contrast to 102.7 eV seen for the TEOS
additive, resulting in SiOx.61 The 102.0 eV could be possibly residual Si3N4 formed in the laser sintering printing process.61 There was no observable titanium peak in the
untreated nylon-12. Ti 2p scans for the treated samples were similar
and assigned as TiO2, with Ti 2p3/2 values of
458.7 eV for titanium(IV) butoxide and the titanium(IV) butoxide and
TEOS mixture and 458.4 eV for the TiO2 sol.

Following
the surface-based analysis, we used X-ray computed tomography
(CT) imaging to investigate the depth and homogeneity of material
impregnation achieved by the various chemical treatments, using a
model shape consisting of rows of pyramids (Figure 6). The titanium(IV) butoxide (TBX), TiO2, and titanium(IV) butoxide–TEOS treatments resulted
in an increased radiopacity because of the deposition of electron-dense
metal (titanium) on the surface of the nylon-12 framework. The uniformity
of these coatings can be seen on the 3D volume renderings of the CT
data (Figure 6A). Cross-sectional
CT slices showed that the depth of these coatings was approximately
0.5 mm (Figure 6B,C).
Because of the low radiopacity of the APTES and TEOS coatings, these
were not as visible as the titanium-based coatings and hence were
indistinguishable from the untreated nylon-12 scaffold.

treated and untreated 3D printed scaffolds, with grayscale

radiopacity following treatment with TiO2, titanium(IV)

APTES-treated scaffolds show a radiopacity similar to that of the
untreated material. (B) CT cross sections show that the chemical treatments
are limited to the surface in the cases of TiO2, titanium(IV)
butoxide, and TEOS–titanium(IV) butoxide, whereas TEOS and
APTES are not detectable because of their radiopacity comparable to
that of the untreated scaffolds. (C) CT signal intensity (HU) along

2.3 Cell
Growth on Surface-Modified 3D Printed
Substrates
To enable high-throughput screening of the biocompatibility
of different 3D printed scaffold chemical treatments, discs of 6.35
mm diameter and 2 mm depth were 3D-printed for insertion into standard
96-well format tissue culture assay plates. These nylon-12 discs were
modified with each of the above described chemical treatments prior
to cell seeding, and untreated samples were used for comparison. Mesenchymal
stem cells were seeded at 1000 per well, and cell growth was monitored
on each of the substrates over the duration of 16 days, at which point
cell numbers had plateaued (see Figure 7). Prior to seeding, cells had been modified using
a lentivirus to enable expression of luciferase—an enzyme capable
of light production in the presence of its substrate luciferin, and
adenosine triphosphate, which is produced only in actively metabolizing
(alive) cells. Light readout is therefore a measure of viable cell
population size.

Figure 7 Growth of mesenchymal stem cells (1000 per well) seeded
onto the
surface of 3D printed scaffolds modified with a range of chemical
treatments. The points represent the mean of n =
6 independently seeded wells, and error bars show standard error of
the mean. The light output corresponds to photon counts measured following
the addition of bioluminescent substrate to the cells and indicates
relative viable cell population size. Statistical analysis is presented
in Table S2.

A two-way ANOVA comparison of the data shows difference in
cell
growth between chemical treatment groups accounted for 25.6% of variation,
while time accounted for 32.9%, with a 26.0% interaction between the
two (p < 0.001% for each source of variation).
There were clear differences in cell growth rate between the treatment
types, with the doubling time of cells on the APTES (21 h) and TEOS
(21.2 h) treatment conditions being shorter than that of the untreated
3D printed plastic substrate (26.3 h), demonstrating their enhancement
on cell growth. On the other hand, titanium(IV) butoxide (126.9 h),
TiO2 (155.9 h), and titanium(IV) butoxide–TEOS (47.6
h) showed much slower cell growth than the untreated 3D printed plastic,
demonstrating their inhibition of proliferation. Multiple comparison
tests (with Dunnett correction for multiple comparisons) against the
untreated disc showed significant differences in cell number at a
number of time points after seeding for each condition compared to
the control untreated discs (see Table S2). Together, these results show that the TEOS and APTES treatments
as well as the untreated plastic are highly suitable for stem cell
growth, whereas the titanium(IV) butoxide, TiO2, and titanium(IV)
butoxide–TEOS treatments are not conducive to stem cell growth.
This is supported by the water contact angle data (Table 1), with the lowest water contact
angles being more conducive to cell growth than the larger, more hydrophobic
contact angles. This is due to the difficulty the adherent cells experience
with more hydrophobic surfaces; however, the relatively high water
contact angle of the APTES sample appears to be contrary to this trend.
This is most likely due to the alkoxysilane contributing to its hydrophobicity
but also providing a highly porous primary amine-rich network providing
an ideal substrate for strong protein interaction,39 leading to good cell adhesion and growth.

To investigate
the suitability of these materials to support osteoblast
cell differentiation, the cells were grown to confluence and differentiation
was induced using a recently described protocol.61 Following 2 weeks of differentiation, samples were fixed
and analyzed for the presence of hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), which is produced by osteocytes,
is the main chemical constituents of bone (∼70% by weight),
and is important for its mechanical properties. This analysis showed
an increase in hydroxyapatite production following differentiation,
compared to predifferentiation, demonstrating that each of these biomaterials
is able to support osteocytic differentiation of mesenchymal stem
cells.

To test for the presence of hydroxyapatite, XPS spectra
of the
differentiated cells were taken, with the high-resolution scans of
O 1s, Ca 2p, and P 2p interrogated and summarized in Figure 5. As previously stated, nylon-12
did itself contain traces of silicon, phosphorus, and calcium. However,
the quantities of these were in stark contrast to the far larger amount
of phosphorus and calcium seen after cell differentiation. The binding
energy values of 347.2 eV for Ca 2p3/2 and 352.7 eV for
Ca 2p1/2 are in good agreement with the literature for
hydroxyapatite62,63 (in Figure 5a), as are the corresponding P 2p spectrum
with binding energy values of 133.1 eV (P 2p3/2) and 133.9
(P 2p1/2) in Figure 5b.

2.4 Superhydrophobic Treatment
of 3D Printed Substrates
Superhydrophobic surfaces have been
the subject of intense research
over the last decade, with uses as diverse as anti-icing and antimicrobial
coatings to oil–water separation devices and omniphobic materials.64−67 Therefore, the ability to covert hydrophilic 3D printed SLS nylon-12
plastics would be highly desirable for use in external environments
as well as preventing bacterial adhesion in vivo.

To superhydrophobically
treat the nylon-12 substrates, we printed 1 in. square flat substrates
and sprayed them with an aerosol of Rust-Oleum NeverWet Liquid Repelling
Treatment, before drying overnight. The intrinsic roughness of the
nylon-12 surface seen in SEM micrographs in Figure 3a helped the NeverWet silica-based spray
to exacerbate the surface roughness, leading to a superhydrophobic
static water contact angle of 167 ± 1.6° (Figures S3 and S4). When measuring the contact angle, the
surface exhibited extreme hydrophobicity and as such the syringe had
to be kept in place to prevent the water droplet rolling off the surface.

Chemical treatments such as the use of perfluoroalkoxysilanes or
silicon-/polymer-based composite sprays are facile methods to make
SLS frameworks superhydrophobic. The ease of application (i.e., spray-coating)
makes this method very attractive for the manufacture of water- and
stain-resistant coatings for 3D printed materials of conceivably any
shape or size.

2.5 Incorporation of Iron Oxide
Nanoparticles
and Heating via Magnetic Hyperthermia
The incorporation of
preformed nanomaterials into a 3D printed SLS framework allows for
the facile addition of nanomaterials and their respective properties
to a framework at room temperature. Relatively low level heating (90
°C) is needed for the conversion of metal alkoxide precursors
to metal oxides, allowing materials which require high-temperature
synthesis to be incorporated without being affected, such as titanium
dioxide and iron oxide nanoparticles.

The rationale behind this
was to create a material that would respond to an external ac magnetic
field by heating. With further optimization of heating properties,
this would lend itself to a variety of applications in vivo such as
a substitute for (or a complement to) antimicrobial coatings currently
in use for biomedical implants,68−71 for magnetic hyperthermia-based drug delivery,50,72,73 or for heat-induced gene expression.74−76

The cubic framework (Figure 8) was heated rapidly from an initial temperature of
25.6 °C
and plateaued at ∼45 °C over a heating period of 3 min.
After 7.5 min, the ac magnetic field was removed, leading to a rapid
cooling back to room temperature (Figure 8a). The surface porosity provides a large
thermal interface between the heating layer and the surrounding air,
and although liquid surroundings and blood flow in vivo would reduce
peak heating temperatures, rapid thermal response in response to an
applied (and removed) magnetic field is an excellent functional quality
to have in a prospective biomaterial implant. Although this temperature
is currently insufficient for sterilization, application of solutions
of magnetic particles to the prints that are designed for hyperthermic
heating (rather than a generic ferrofluid) would give higher temperatures
as well as complement other therapies.50 Interestingly, the temperatures achieved here fit within the optimal
range (43–45 °C) for inducing gene expression via control
of the heat shock 70 (HSP70) promoter,74 which would enable temporal and spatial control of therapeutic protein
production in engineered cells seeded onto the scaffold. The flexible,
low-temperature, and relatively compatible nature of all treatments
described also invites further investigations of stepwise additions
of hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and heating, or other nanomaterial layers
into the print surface to create more complex implant materials.

and (d,e) water droplet on a nylon surface treated with titanium(IV)
butoxide (d) and TEOS (e) showing the difference in surface wetting.

2.6 Adhesion
Testing of Treated Substrates
Using a simple Scotch tape
test, the substrates were checked to see
how well the treatments adhered to the printed objects. One side of
the treated objects was pressed onto a piece of Scotch tape for 30
s and removed. This was repeated 10 times under a HEPA filtration
hood to reduce the occurrence of dust. The only treatments that showed
some observable loss of material by eye were the ferrofluid-treated
cubes and the TEOS-treated objects, in this case, the spike array.
The results of these tests are shown in Figure S7. The ferrofluid-treated cube lost a very small amount of
particulate material, the amount of which did not decrease discernibly
over the course of the 10 impressions on the tape, even under 10×
magnification. The TEOS-treated objects lost progressively less material
over the course of five impressions until the material could not be
distinguished from the impression on the tape adhesive, even under
strong direct illumination. Under 10× magnification, a small
amount of material deposition could be seen, and with further impressions,
this was indistinguishable from background dust. For both objects,
the coloration or appearance of the object surface did not change
after repeated tests.

As the ferrofluid was left to dry on the
cube after wicking, it is most likely not to be well-bound to the
nylon print, with the small area on the very surface that the Scotch
tape adhered to losing small amounts of magnetic nanoparticles with
each impression. In the case of TEOS, it is formed chemically inside
the print surface, hence will conform to its exact surface morphology,
and is thus better bound to the structure. Because of this, after
an initial small loss of material not well-bound to itself, we see
little, if any, loss after a small number of impressions on the tape.
Overall, this small amount of material loss across all print treatments
is encouraging, as with any biofunctional material, further sealing
would be required in any case, but the fact that these treatments
are generally well-bound means that we can create well-localized functional
areas and layers and be sure that there will be little, if any, intermixing
of material within the print surfaces.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, we demonstrate the versatility of 3D printed nylon-12
as a vehicle to promote the growth and differentiation of stem cells
with low-temperature sol–gel treatment. Three-dimensional printed
frameworks have tremendous potential for use as biomaterials and are
especially effective when combined with postsynthesis chemical treatment,
as demonstrated herein. We have demonstrated that SLS 3D printed frameworks
can be impregnated with material precursors in the form of alkoxides,
which form the corresponding metal oxide. This surface modification
was then shown to be highly effective in promoting/retarding cell
growth, cell differentiation, and growth of hydroxyapatite, giving
these materials huge promise for osseointegration.

Treatment
to make 3D printed substrates superhydrophobic is facile
and important as it allows the properties of surfaces to be tuned
depending on the application required. For example, to prevent bacterial
adhesion, a rougher more hydrophobic surface is required, whereas
a more hydrophilic surface is more conducive to cell growth.

We further demonstrated the uptake of preformed nanoparticles into
the frameworks in the form of iron oxide nanoparticles, which could
be heated on-demand by an externally applied ac magnetic field. The
material displayed a steady rate of heating to a plateau as a response
to the field, before rapid cooling to room temperature. This could
potentially be used to remotely induce controlled expression of genes
from engineered cells adhered to these materials. Conveniently, the
temperature at which this material plateaued is within the optimal
range for activating the heat shock 70 (HSP70) promoter (43–45
°C),74 which can be coupled to activate
any therapeutic gene of interest. An alternative strategy demonstrated
the control of insulin production using heating to activate the temperature-sensitive
TRPV1 channel,74,75 providing a route to manage diabetes
using remote control of gene expression. Further applications could
use induction of gene expression to promote cell differentiation within
prepatterned regions or layers, determined by iron oxide deposition.

In all, the properties of 3D printing of materials can be dramatically
enhanced by postsynthesis chemical or nanomaterial modification, with
simple treatments allowing SLS-printed materials to be highly effective
in a huge variety of roles, not least in the field of biomaterials
and medicine.

4 Experimental Section

(≥98%), fumed silica (powder, 0.2–0.3 μm avg.
part. size), TEOS (reagent grade, 97%), titanium(IV) butoxide (reagent
grade, 97%), acetonitrile (CHROMASOLV gradient grade for HPLC ≥99.9%),
titanium(IV) oxide anatase powder (325 mesh, ≥ 99% trace metal
basis), trimethylamine (≥99%), and adenosine [suitable for
cell culture, BioReagent (Sigma)] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Ltd. Acetylacetone (AnalaR), 1-butanol (98.5%), and 2-propanol (tech.
grade) were purchased from VWR Ltd. Nylon-12 powder (PA2200) was obtained
from EOS GmbH Electro Optical Systems. d-Luciferin was purchased
from Promega. Ferrotec EFH1 ferrofluid (10 nm Fe2O3 in light hydrocarbon carrier) was obtained from Magnet Expert
Ltd. Mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSC D1; ATCC CRL-12424) transduced
using a lentiviral vector encoding luciferase were a kind gift from
Dr Arthur Taylor (University of Liverpool) and were grown in DMEM
(Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; Gibco) with 10%
added fetal bovine serum (Gibco), at 37 °C, 95% air, 5% CO2, and 95% relative humidity. Rust-Oleum NeverWet Liquid Repelling
Treatment was bought from B&Q plc.

Other solvents used were
of the highest possible grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd.
UHQ deionized water with a resistivity of not less than 18.2 MΩ
cm–1 (Millipore) was used for aqueous solutions
and substrate dissolution.

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Three-Dimensional Printing of Nylon-12 Frameworks
Various
CAD models were designed in Sketchup design software, and
printer-compatible human ossicle (ear bone) models were downloaded
from thingiverse.com.52 Objects were manufactured
by an EOS Formiga P100 SLS machine, and the printed parts were then
removed from the printer and cleaned using pressured air, soaked in
ethanol for 48 h and allowed to dry, then further rinsed in deionized
water, and allowed to dry under an air current in a fume cupboard,
ready for chemical treatment.

4.2.2 Titania
Sol–Gel Synthesis
Titania sols were prepared using
the protocol developed by Powell
et al.53,54 Briefly, titanium(IV) butoxide (50 mmol,
17.0 mL) was added to a mixture of acetylacetone (25 mmol, 2.57 mL)
and 1-butanol (50 mmol, 4.58 mL) under vigorous stirring, giving a
transparent yellow sol. After 1 h, a mixture of 2-propanol (150 mmol,
11.5 mL) and deionized water (3.64 mL) was added before further stirring
for 1 h. Acetonitrile (40 mmol, 2.09 mL) was then added, and the whole
system was sealed and allowed to age overnight (ca. 10 h) before dip-coating.
Sols were stable up to 6 months if stored in an air-tight container.

4.2.3 Incorporation of Material Precursors into
Printed Frameworks
SLS printing nylon-12 parts were immersed
in the aforementioned titania sol, neat TEOS, a 50:50 v/v mixture
of titanium(IV) butoxide and TEOS, or a 2% APTES solution in triethylamine
for 48 h at room temperature. The parts were then removed, allowed
to drip-dry, and then placed in an air drying oven at 90 °C for
a 2 week period.

4.2.4 Incorporation of Nanoparticles
into Printed
Frameworks
EFH1 ferrofluid (10 μL) was pipetted onto
the SLS-printed cube structure at a corner vertex and allowed to saturate
the structure surface over a period of 2 h. The magnetic nanoparticle-SLS
cubes were then air-dried for 48 h at 90 °C. The cube was then
subjected to an ac magnetic field of a frequency of 930 kHz and a
strength of 15 kA m–1 whilst being recorded by a
thermal camera for 20 min. The experiment was run at a constant room
temperature of 24 °C.

4.2.5 Cell Seeding and Growth
Cells were
seeded at 1000 per well in a volume of 100 μL growth medium
into an opaque black 96-well plate containing one 3D printed disc
(6.35 mm diameter) per well. Six individual well replicates were done
for each treatment condition. All discs were washed twice in 100%
ethanol following 24 h soaking periods in ethanol to remove any unreacted
precursors used in the treatments, dried, and then soaked for 2 h
in culture medium to equilibrate, prior to cell seeding.

4.2.6 Superhydrophobic Treatment of Frameworks
Samples of
3D printed nylon-12, typically 25 mm square, were coated
with Rust-Oleum NeverWet Liquid Repelling Treatment via an aerosol
following the manufacturer’s instructions and allowed to dry
in air overnight.
