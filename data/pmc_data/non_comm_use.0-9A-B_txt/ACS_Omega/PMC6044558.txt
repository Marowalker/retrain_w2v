Eg5
is a mitotic kinesin protein that plays an important
role in the formation and maintenance of the bipolar spindle during
the mitotic phase. Due to its potentially reduced side effects in
cancer therapy, Eg5 is considered to be an attractive target for developing
anticancer inhibitors. Herein, we report a computational modeling
study involving biphenyl-type inhibitors known to interact with the
α4/α6 allosteric pocket of Eg5. Compared to the well-known
α2/L5/α3 allosteric inhibitors, biphenyl-type inhibitors
show a unique activity profile. In the Eg5–PVZB1194 (a biphenyl-type
inhibitor) crystal structure, loop L11, which is located in the entrance
of the α4/α6 allosteric-binding pocket, is missing due
to crystal-packing effects. To better understand the role of this
flexible loop upon biphenyl-type inhibitor-binding, MD simulations
were performed to observe the L11 conformations from different states.
It was demonstrated that L11 was more stabilized and showed less fluctuation
when PVZB1194 was bound to Eg5. Residue Asn287 from L11 forms hydrogen
bonding to the sulfone group of PVZB1194, whereby L11 moves inward
to the α4/α6 allosteric pocket and moves away from the
pocket in absence of the inhibitor. Pharmacophore, three-dimensional
(3D)-QSAR, and ADME studies of biphenyl-type inhibitors of Eg5 were
also performed. A best pharmacophore model, DDRRH.6, was generated,
having correlation coefficients in the 3D-QSAR study of R2 = 0.81 and Q2 = 0.64. Furthermore,
docking studies were carried out to observe the interaction between
the remaining biphenyl-type inhibitors with Eg5. In addition, on the
basis of fragment docking, a structure-based pharmacophore was generated,
which shares good overlap of the DHRR features of the pharmacophore
model DDHRR.6. The structure-based pharmacophore also contains extra
hydrogen-bond acceptors and hydrophobic groups, features which provide
possibilities in developing new or improved series of compounds.

==== Body
Introduction
Kinesins are a superfamily
of motor proteins that are involved
in a diverse range of physiological functions, such as mitotic spindle
assembly, chromosome segregation, vesicular trafficking, and so forth.
They are sometimes described as “nanomotors” as they
utilize energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate force and transport
intracellular cargos along the microtubules (MTs).1,2 Eg5,
also termed KIF11, is a member of the mitotic kinesin-5 family, which
is a subgroup of kinesins that only functions during the mitotic phase
of cell division. Eg5 acts on mitosis to help bipolar spindle formation,
chromosome alignment, and segregation.3

In many proliferative tissues, Eg5 is found to be overexpressed.
However, it is rarely detected in the nonproliferative ones. Accordingly,
the overexpression of Eg5 was found in various cancers, including
breast, lung, ovarian, bladder, and pancreatic cancers as well as
in leukemia,4−6 making it a potential target for cancer therapy.7 Eg5 inhibition prevents separation of centrosomes
and formation of mitotic spindle, which leads to formation of “monoasters”
consisting of monopolar spindles, and further triggers spindle checkpoint
proteins to cause direct mitotic arrest and inhibition of cell division.8−10 It has been demonstrated that in human xenograft models inhibition
of Eg5 causes complete cell death in many cancer-cell lines and displays
in vivo antitumor activity.11,12 As Eg5 only functions
during mitosis, inhibitors of Eg5 do not affect the nonproliferative
cells. Furthermore, because Eg5 does not exist in the adult peripheral
nervous system, inhibitors of Eg5 thus do not induce neuropathic side
effects, which are otherwise commonly found for inhibitors of tubulin
also developed with the aim to affect mitosis.7,13

Ispinesib (SB-743921) and filanesib (ARRY-520) are amongst the
inhibitors that specifically target Eg5, which are currently under
clinical development.14−16 Instead of interacting with the ATP-binding site,
these inhibitors bind to an extensively studied allosteric site about
10 Å away, which is composed of helix α2, loop L5, and
helix α3 (Figure 1A).17−19 Biochemical studies indicate that by inhibiting ADP
release from Eg5 this set of compounds functions as ATP-uncompetitive
inhibitors.7,14,20 Although they display potent anticancer activity, drug-resistant
mutants, D130V and A133D, located in loop L5 have already been identified
in cell cultures. Therefore, a new series of inhibitors that target
a novel inhibitor-binding pocket could be developed and utilized either
alone or together, with known Eg5 inhibitors targeting the α2/L5/α3
region.

Figure 1 (A) Eg5 with bound AMMPNP (PDB ID: 3HQD), showing pockets α2/L5/α3
and α4/L11/α6. (B) PVZB1194-bound Eg5 (blue) superposed
to AMMPNP-bound Eg5 (green). Residues Glu129 and Thr104 (in yellow)
from PVZB1194-bound Eg5 clash with the nucleotide binding, whereas
residues Glu129 and Thr104 (in pink) from nucleotide-bound Eg5 are
not in the ligand-binding site.

Biphenyl compounds have been identified as another type of
Eg5
inhibitor by several groups.21,22 This set of compounds
was shown to inhibit ispinesib-resistant tumor cells that harbor D130V
and A133D mutations with high activity.23−25 One of the biphenyl-type
inhibitors, PVZB1194, was shown to bind to a different allosteric
pocket, composed by helices α4 and α6. This pocket is
located 15 Å from the nucleotide-binding pocket (Figure 1A). Once the biphenyl-type
inhibitors bind to the α4/α6 allosteric pocket, they are
capable of distorting the ATP-binding site through Tyr104 residues,
which displace the residues Thr107 and Glu129 into the nucleotide-binding
pockets and thereby suppress the binding of ATP and function as ATP-competitive
inhibitors26 (Figure 1B). Hence, the ATP-binding site of Eg5–PVZB1194
contains neither ADP nor ATP. This is different from the benzimidazole
type inhibitor BI8,27 which binds to the
α4/α6 pocket, when Eg5 is in complex with ATP or ADP and
thus, similary to conventional allosteric inhibitors, inhibits the
release of ADP. Hence, the allosteric effect asserted by biphenyl-type
inhibitors, such as PVZB1194, on the binding of ATP is unique. PVZB1194
is furthermore shown to potently inhibit Eg5 in a MT-dependent manner
and induce a monoastral phenotype and cause a mitotic arrest.26 Because the α4/α6 allosteric pocket
was only recently detected and biphenyl-type inhibitors targeting
this pocket display a unique mechanism in inhibiting ATP binding,
it is of interest to investigate in more detail the interaction between
PVZB1194 (and other biphenyls) and Eg5. The aim is to assist in developing
a new series of inhibitors targeting this pocket. Such compounds can
then be applied alone or in combination with inhibitors targeting
the α2/L5/α3 allosteric pocket. To gain further insight,
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were applied to investigate the
conformational differences upon PVZB1194 binding versus free protein
and in particular, loop L11 at the entrance of the α4/α6
pocket, which is missing in the crystal structure due to its high
flexibility. A common pharmacophore hypothesis of the biphenyl-type
inhibitors was generated and analyzed, and an atom-based three-dimensional
(3D)-QSAR model was evaluated to understand the relationship between
their biological activity and molecular structure. In addition, physicochemical
property calculations and molecular docking studies were also performed,
aimed at assisting in the design of novel allosteric Eg5 inhibitors
targeting the α4/α6 pocket.

Results and Discussion
MD Simulations
Four regions were missing in the crystal
structure of Eg5 complexed to PVZB1194,26 corresponding to residues 57–58 (L2), 108–126 (regions
of the P-loop, N-terminal of α2, and L5), 225–331 (L9),
and 270–287 (L11). Of these, L11 is located in the entrance
of the α4/α6 allosteric pocket and might be capable of
forming hydrogen bonds and other contacts with a bound ligand. When
there is a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue (AMPPNP) bound to Eg5, L11
forms a completely ordered loop, possibly due to interactions provided
by the γ-phosphate of AMPPNP having a stabilizing effect on
the residues of L11.26,31 However, as the biphenyl-type
inhibitors are competitive for ATP binding, the conformation of L11
in the Eg5–PVZB1194 complex is disordered and missing from
the crystal structure. To explore the interaction between L11 and
PVZB1194, we mended L11 by using the protein preparation wizard, as
outlined above, together with other missing regions and performed
MD simulations to sample its conformation with or without the PVZB1194
inhibitor located in the pocket.

The root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) values (Figure 2A) overlap between the unbound Eg5 proteins than between the Eg5–PVZB1194
complex. The root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) values show that
with the inhibitor bound L11 is more stable (encircled region in Figure 2B), with PVZB1194
forming an extra hydrogen bond to Asn287 in L11. PVZB1194 also forms
an extra stable hydrogen bond to Glu345 and a weak one to Ser269 (Figure 2C,D). Therefore,
L11 moves toward the α4/α6 pocket in the complex structure,
whereas in the unbound protein structure it swings out into a much
more open conformation (Figure 2E). Thus, we can conclude that L11 is stabilized by the ligand
binding of residue Asn287 from the L11 hydrogen bonds to sulfone group.
The structure–activity relationship data has shown that the
sulfone group is important for biological inhibitory activity,22 and the above observation from the MD simulations
fully explains this inhibition. The free-energy analysis of L11 shows
how the inhibitor binding influences its conformation. The free energy
was calculated by projecting along the distance of the center of mass
(COM) of L11 to α6 and α4, respectively. Only one energy
minimum is observed for either the free-protein or the complex structure
and centers on the distance values between L11 and α6 (α4)
of 1.8–2 nm (1.1–1.4 nm) for the free protein and 1.5–1.6
nm (1.5–1.6 nm) when in the complex. Therefore, in the free
protein structure, L11 is, relatively speaking, displaced closer to
α4, whereas with the ligand-bound structure, it prefers to stay
in between the two helices (Figure 3A,B). In addition, the free-energy minimum is much
more narrow and localized for the complex system.

COM of L11 to α4 (y axis) and α6 (x axis).

Tyr104 is located at
the bottom of the allosteric pocket (Figure 2E) and was proposed
to be the key residue leading to the ATP-competitive effect of PVZB1194
inhibition(26). After removing PVZB1194 from the pocket, Tyr104, however,
remains in the same position as in the complex structure during the
whole MD simulation by forming a stable hydrogen bond to the residue
Glu270 of L11. Residues Thr107 and Glu129 are displaced into the nucleotide-binding
site and thereby suppress the binding of ATP. In the 500 ns MD simulations
of both PVZB1194-bound and unbound Eg5 structures, these two residues
remain in the same placement as that causing interference with nucleotide
binding, although the loop between Thr107 and Glu129 moves slightly
in a manner normal for loop fluctuations. Thus, more enhanced sampling
methods may be required in this part to observe the larger conformational
changes associated with Tyr104 shifting and Thr104 and Glu129 displacement. However, we emphasize
that PVZB1194 binding induces significant changes to the nucleotide
pocket as compared with the normal undisturbed one such that the placement
of ATP into the pocket then becomes essentially impossible during
the process of simulations. The inhibitor binding distorts Thr107
and Glu129 to occupy the nucleotide-binding pocket and hinders ATP
from entering.

To further explore this aspect, we also built
a model with L11
in its existing AMMPNP-bound Eg5 conformation. L11 is shown, for the
first time, to feature a completely ordered loop in the crystal structure
of Eg5.AMMPNP compared with any other Eg5 crystal structure with ADP
binding or Eg5 alone. Here, we define this as an ordered conformation
and refer to the previous as a disordered conformation. All other
regions were left unchanged, as detailed in the previous section.
In the fully ordered conformation, residues of L11 appear to locate
in the α4 helix. Next, we superposed this ordered conformation
to the PVZB1194-bound Eg5. It is observed that even though L11 is
in an ordered conformation PVZB1194 is able to fit into the binding
pocket (Figure 4A,B).
We then carried out MD simulations on the Eg5 structure with an ordered
L11 conformation, alone or interacting with PVZB1194, to investigate
the impact of the ligand on the L11 conformation. We can observe from
the RMSF calculations over the whole simulation (Figure 4C) that L11 is again much more
stabilized with PVZB1194 bound to the pocket. Regarding fluctuations
of residues Tyr104, Thr107, and Glu129, it was observed that without
PVZB1194 binding Tyr104 fluctuates back to the same position as that
in AMMPNP-bound Eg5 (Figure 4D). This is in contrast to the MD simulation with disordered
L11 conformation, in which the position of Tyr104 did not change due
to hydrogen bonding to Glu270 of L11. From this observation, we propose
that L11 plays a role in shifting the Tyr104 position in the process
of biphenyl-type inhibitor binding/unbinding. A possible scenario
is that when the biphenyl-type inhibitors bind to the α4/α6
allosteric pocket L11 starts to fluctuate, which causes Tyr104 to
reorient. This restructuring propagates the conformational changes
to the nucleotide-binding pocket and leads to the unbinding of ATP.
On the other hand, when ATP binds to the nucleotide-binding pocket,
L11 starts to attain an ordered conformation, which shifts Tyr104
back to its normal position and causes the biphenyl-type inhibitors
to unbind. In relation to the previous discussion, we concluded that
L11 is important for inhibitor binding, and here we furthermore observe
that it is necessary for Tyr104 orientation. It is thus possible that
when the biphenyl-type inhibitor binds to the α4/α6 allosteric
pocket L11 starts to interact with the inhibitor and stabilizes the
inhibitor to further propagate the structural changes in the ATP-binding
pocket. In both simulations, residues Thr107 and Glu129 remain in
the position by which they interfere with nucleotide binding. More
enhanced sampling methods might be required to observe the larger
conformational changes described above.

fluctuations of residues 55–65 in the complex are caused by
interference from the N-terminal of the protein, located far away
from the region of interest. Residues 105–125 fluctuate more
in the complex due to the properties of the loop. (D) Tyr104 moves
from the PVZB1194-binding position (yellow) to PVZB1194-nonbinding
position (blue). AMMPNP-bound Eg5 is colored purple, unbound Eg5 is

Pharmacophore Modeling
A set of 66 biphenyl inhibitors
with the pIC50 activity range from −1.04 to 2.30
were selected for pharmacophore modeling (Table 1).21,22 The active molecules were defined as the compounds with activity
range >1.7, whereas inactive molecules were defined as those with
activity range <0. Of the 66 compounds, 31 were classified as inactive,
5 as active, and 30 as intermediate. The defined active and inactive
molecules were used to test the specificity of the pharmacophore hypothesis,
and the remaining compounds with median activity range (between 0
and 1.7) were used to validate and authenticate the subsequent pharmacophore
hypothesis. On the basis of matching by all active ligands, a total
of six hypotheses were generated for the biphenyl inhibitors. The
inactive ligands were not involved in pharmacophore hypotheses generation
but were used to completely remove hypotheses that did not recognize
the difference between the active and inactive compounds. The survival,
site, vector, volume, and selectivity terms were used to score all
generated hypotheses. The outcomes for the six hypotheses are shown
in Table 2; we can
see that the DDHRR.6 hypothesis shows the highest survival (3.785).
The DDHRR.6 hypothesis also shows the highest survival minus inactive
score, which is the subtraction of the inactive features from the
hypothesis.

The
pharmacophore hypothesis DDHRR.6 was mapped on the sets of
aligned active and inactive molecules, displayed in Figure 5A,B, respectively. The components
of the DDHRR.6 hypothesis are two hydrogen-bond donors, two aromatic
rings, and one hydrophobic feature. The amide groups represent the
hydrogen-bond donors, whereas the two phenyl rings on adjacent sides
of the compounds represent the two aromatic features, and the hydrophobic
feature is mapped onto the trifluoromethyl group. Hence, these groups
are crucial for biological activity of this series of compounds and
can be further used to screen and design new candidates. By mapping
the most active (no. 38) (Figure 5C) and inactive compound (no. 58) (Figure 5D) to the pharmacophore features,
it can be noticed that although the most inactive compound has four
features matched, it has an ethylsulfone instead of the trifluoromethyl
substituent, which leads to a dramatic decrease of inhibitory activity,
from 5 to 10 904 nM. The reason is that any functional group
larger than trifluoromethyl in this position will not fit the pocket
of Eg5, which is discussed in detail in the docking section below.
Further differences between active and inactive compounds originate
from the inactive compounds either lacking a hydrogen-bond donor (Figure 5E), such as compound
2 with IC50 value of 1000 nM, or having an extra hydrophobic
group (Figure 5F) attached
to the phenyl group, such as compound 21 with IC50 value
of 6000 nM, in both cases causing less favorable binding to the receptor.

compounds, (C) the most active compound, (D) the most inactive compound,
(E) compound 2, (F) compound 21, and (G) structure-based pharmacophore
with PVZB1194 placed in the binding pocket.

In addition to the above, a structure-based pharmacophore
was generated
on the basis of clustering 667 fragments derived from molecules in
the medicinal chemistry literature, which were docked into the α4/α6-binding
pocket. This eliminates the need for known active inhibitors to generate
the pharmacophore models and helps to identify new regions of the
active site to target for drug design. By generating a structure-based
pharmacophore, it is also possible to further analyze the ligand-based
pharmacophore discussed previously. Seven pharmacophore features,
AADHHRR, were obtained, that is, one hydrogen-bond donor (D), two
ring aromatics (R), two hydrophobes (H), and two hydrogen-bond acceptors
(A). By mapping PVZB1194 in the binding pocket to the generated pharmacophore
features, it can be seen that the two phenyl groups locate close to
the aromatic ring features, the sulfone group to a hydrogen-bond acceptor
feature, the trifluoromethyl group to one of the hydrophobic features,
and the amide group to a hydrogen-bond donor feature (Figure 5G). Compared to the ligand-based
pharmacophore DDHRR.6, we can see that there is a good overlap of
the DHRR features. The extra hydrogen-bond donor in the ligand-based
pharmacophore, which was demonstrated to increase the inhibitory activity
and incorporates the sulfone group of PVZB1194, overlaps with the
extra hydrogen-bond acceptor feature in the structure-based pharmacophore.
Taking together, we can constitute a more effective pharmacophore
here with ADDHRR. Two more features (A and H) from the structure-based
pharmacophore may be possible to explore for targeting a new region
of the allosteric site. We note, however, that the hydrogen-bond acceptor
(A) feature at Asn289 is relatively distant from the others.

Three-Dimensional-QSAR
and Docking
The 66 compounds
were randomly divided into a training (70% of the compounds) and test
set (30% of the compounds). Using PLS regression, the hypothesis DDHRR.6
with the highest score was explored further in a QSAR study on the
basis of the alignment of pharmacophore features to the training and
test set compounds. Using only up to four factors of PLS regression,
the aligned data set should be well correlated, whereas increase of
PLS factors beyond four in general, will not improve model statistics
or predictability. In QSAR theory, if the correlation coefficients
based on the training set (R2) and test
set (Q2) is >0.5, then a satisfactory
model is generated. The PLS statistical parameters of the generated
3D-QSAR model are listed in Table 3. By choosing a PLS factor of 3, the generated QSAR
model has values of correlation coefficients R2 = 0.81 and Q2 = 0.64, which implies
this QSAR model is acceptable. In addition, the stability of the model
is 0.81 (standard stability value >0.3 with a maximum scale of
1)
and F value is 60.4 with small P values (1.85 × 10–15); these additional parameters
further imply a high degree of validity of the model. The correlation
between experimentally observed and predicted activities of the test
and training sets are shown in Figure 6 and Table S1, which illustrates
that the 3D-QSAR model has good predictive ability.

(y) activity for (A) training set and (B) test set

Contour maps from the 3D-QSAR model
were generated to help in understanding
the importance of functional groups at specific positions toward biological
activity. By analyzing the contour map of the most active compound
(Figure 7), we can
infer that the favorable regions of the hydrogen-bond donor effect
are located toward the donor features (D5, D3). In the case of the
hydrophobic effect, the favorable regions are seen surrounding the
hydrophobic feature (H7), whereas hydrophobically unfavorable areas
are identified at the hydrogen bond donor end plus the associated
phenyl group or have hydrophobic groups larger than H7. In the case
of the electron-withdrawing effect, the favorable regions are seen
around the sulfone group and at the position of the phenyl-attached
fluorine, indicating that an additional acceptor group in this position
could increase the biological activity.

On the basis of the free-energy
analysis of the MD simulations,
an Eg5 structure with the most relaxed L11 conformation was chosen
for the docking studies. All 66 ligands were docked into the α4/α6
pocket and the binding modes and interacting residues were analyzed.
To simplify presentation of the docking results, we have selected
the same four representative ligands as in the above pharmacophore
section. The most active compound (entry 38), which has an IC50 value of 5 nM compared to 140 nM for PVZB1194 (entry 12),
forms an extra hydrogen bond with Glu345 due to the extra amide group.
However, for the most inactive compound, the whole compound shifts
due to the large and bulky ethylsulfone group to fit into the bottom
of the pocket, whereby one of the amide groups loses the hydrogen
bonding to Glu345. For compound 2, no hydrogen bonding was observed,
and compound 21 has a flipped docking position due to its side chain
being placed in the meta position, which is unfavorable for binding
(Figure 8).

ADME Features
In clinical trials, one of the common
failures of drug candidates is poor pharmacokinetics (PKs). Therefore,
selecting drug candidates with ideal ADME properties at early stages
can help in passing clinical trial studies. With this aim, the relevant
descriptors of ADME properties for the tested compounds were examined
in this study, among which log Po/w, log S, PCaco, log BB, log MDCK,
and PSA were selected. The PK parameters were computed for all 66
compounds (Table 4),
and although there was a relatively large spread regarding inhibitory
activities (from 5 to 10 904 nM), it is still valuable to compare
and understand their PK properties. The log  Po/w, which is the octanol/water partition coefficient,
is within the range of 1.10–5.70 for all compounds, which suggests
that all molecules are ideal. The log S, which
is aqueous solubility (S) of the compounds, ranges
between −6.43 and −2.49 mol/L. The ability of a compound
to interact with the solvent by dipolar or hydrogen-bonding interaction
is represented by polar solvent accessible area (PSA) terms. It was
observed that compound 22 possesses a PSA of 0 Å, whereas the
rest are in the range of 12.54–119.33 Å, which is within
the acceptable maximum limit of 120 Å. log BB predicts
the brain/blood partition coefficient, and the compounds possess values
in the range of −1.82 to 0.51, which again is within the tolerable
limit. Furthermore, PCaco indicates the ability to permeate across
the gut–blood barrier, and log MDCK is the permeability
of the compounds across the Madin–Darby canine kidney cells
(nm/s); it was found that all compounds possess ideal PCaco and log MDCK
values, which suggests that they can easily be transported across
the gut–blood barrier and distal renal epithelia, respectively.

Conclusions
MD simulations have
been carried out on the Eg5 protein and Eg5–PVZB1194
complex, with ordered or disordered loop L11, to better understand
key features of the α4/α6 allosteric pocket. With L11
in a disordered state, the complex structure shows that there are
three residues hydrogen bonded to the inhibitor PVZB1194, one of which
(Asn287) comes from L11. L11 becomes much more stable and moves toward
the pocket and preferably resides between α4 and α6 with
inhibitor present, whereas without inhibitor L11 is more flexible
and moves outward from the pocket and prefers to stay closer to α4.
Residue Tyr104, which plays an important role in generating the ATP-competitive
conformation, did not display any large movements during the simulation,
even without the inhibitor binding to the pocket due to hydrogen bonding
to residue Glu270. Even with an ordered L11 conformation, as observed
in the AMMPNP-bound Eg5 structure, PVZB1194 was able to fit into the
pocket and cause reduced L11 fluctuation. A ligand-based pharmacophore
and atom-based 3D-QSAR study in combination with molecular docking
was carried out to identify the key pharmacophore features for obtaining
biological activity of biphenyl-based ligands toward the α4/α6
allosteric pocket. The five most active compounds share common pharmacophore
features, including two hydrogen-bond donors, two aromatic rings,
and one hydrophobic group. Analysis of the 3D-QSAR studies provided
further information on how to increase the biological activity of
the current compounds. Docking the 66 biphenylic compounds into the
allosteric pocket demonstrates the importance of the sulfone amide
group in interaction with the receptor. A structure-based pharmacophore
was also generated on the basis of extensive fragment docking. The
two pharmacophore models show overlapping DHRR features, and two additional
features (A, H) were identified that may be explored for additional
binding to the active site. From the bioavailability and ADME point
of view, essentially all 66 biphenyl compounds would be capable of
passing the clinical trial phases. The study herein provides a set
of guidelines that will assist in understanding the biphenyl-type
inhibitor interactions with Eg5 and in designing new and more potent
leads for targeting this specific allosteric pocket.

Methods
MD Simulations
and Homology Model
The Eg5–PVZB1194
complex structure was retrieved from the protein databank (PDB ID: 3WPN).26 The default protein preparation wizard in Schrödinger
was used to prepare and refine the structure in the same manner as
in our previous studies.28,29 First, the structure
was checked to guarantee the chemical correctness. Hydrogens were
added to the structure, and the side chains that were far from the
binding pocket and not forming any salt bridges with other side chains
were neutralized. Hydroxyl groups, water molecules, and amide groups
of Asn and Gln were reoriented to optimize the hydrogen-bonding network.
Because no His residues were included in the binding pocket, the appropriate
protonation states and orientations of the imidazole rings were automatically
determined by the preparation wizard. ACE and NMA residues were added
to cap the termini, and missing side chains and missing loops with
less than 20 residues were added. In the final step, the OPLS-2005
force field30 was used to minimize the
structure with the heavy atoms constrained. The prepared structure
was then used for subsequent homology modeling and MD simulations.

To generate an Eg5 structure with L11 in an ordered state, we carried
out homology modeling based on two selected templates, the above prepared
Eg5–PVZB1194 structure and the Eg5 bound to the substrate analogue
AMMPNP (PDB ID: 3HQD),31 using Prime (Schrödinger,
LLC, NY).32 The resulting structure was
constructed by superposing the two templates and using defined residues
from L11 of the AMMPNP-bound Eg5 structure together with the remainder
from the above prepared Eg5–PVZB1194 structure.

The molecule
PVZB1194 was first minimized at the AM1 semiempirical
level,33 after which the restrained electrostatic
potential (RESP) procedure at the HF/6-31G* level was used to calculate
the atomic charges. Using the Antechamber module in the AMBER10 program,34 the GAFF force field parameters35 and RESP partial charges were assigned to the molecule.
The LEaP module was used to add missing hydrogen atoms.

Four
conventional 500 ns MD simulations were carried out on the
Eg5–PVZB1194 complex structure and Eg5 protein structure only,
in which the Amber 99 force field36,37 and GROMACS
software38 were used. The whole workflow
of MD simulations was the same as that in those carried out in our
previous studies.28,29,39 A buffer distance of 10.0 Å was used to solvate the structures
with TIP3P water in periodic boxes. To adjust the electroneutrality
condition of the systems, 0.1 mol/L of Na+ and Cl– ions were added. Energy minimization with 200 steps of the steepest
descent was carried out to remove close contacts in the obtained systems.
Following that, to make sure the water molecules would reach more
favorable positions, a 2 ns position-restrained simulation with a
constant pressure ensemble (NPT) was performed, with a time step of
1 fs, temperature of 298 K, and coupling pressure of 1 bar. For long-range
electrostatics, particle-mesh Ewald40,41 summation
was used. The cutoff of Coulomb and Lennard-Jones interactions was
set to be 10 Å. The Berendsen coupling algorithm42 was used to control the temperature and pressure, with
the time constants 0.1 ps for temperature and 1.0 ps for pressure
coupling. The LINCS algorithm43 was used
to constrain all bond lengths. Following the position-restrained simulation,
500 ns production simulations with NPT ensemble were performed on
each system for evaluation and analysis. In this step, the Nosé–Hoover
thermostat,44 with a time constant 0.1
ps, was used to control the temperature and the Parrinello–Rahman
barostat,45 with a time constant 1.0 ps,
was used to control the pressure. The other parameters remained the
same as those in the position-restrained simulations.

Docking and
Structure-Based Pharmacophore Generation
The resulting relaxed
Eg5–PVZB1194 complex structure was attained
from the final snapshot of the 500 ns MD simulations. On the basis
of the obtained structure, the Receptor Grid Generation panel (Schrödinger,
LLC, NY) was used to generate grids to specify the position and size
of the active site. Grids were defined by centering them on the bound
PVZB1194 using the default box size. Both the 66 recently published
biphenyl compounds, which were tested for their inhibition effects
for Eg521,22 (Table 1) and a set of 667 fragments from the Schrödinger
fragment library were docked into the α4/α6 allosteric
site. To grant full flexibility to the ligands, the XP (extra precision)46 docking function of Glide47 was used. To select the best docked poses, a post-docking
minimization was carried out on the output complexes and the number
of docking poses per ligand was reduced from 10 000 to 5. The
local optimization feature in Prime was then used to minimize the
resulting poses.

Fragment clustering was used for the complex
structure of Eg5 with the 667 docked fragments to generate a structure-based
pharmacophore. The methodology has been described in detail in the
previous works by us and other groups.28,48 In brief,
the pharmacophore features were generated on the basis of the XP descriptor
information. Phase v3.0 (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY) was
used to automatically generate pharmacophore sites on the basis of
six possible chemical features, namely hydrogen-bond acceptor (A),
hydrogen-bond donor (D), hydrophobe (H), negative ionizable (N), positive
ionizable (P), and aromatic ring (R). Quantification and ranking of
each feature was followed in the final step and was on the basis of
the energy value, which equals the sum of the Glide XP contributions.

Pharmacophore Modeling
The pharmacophore and 3D-QSAR
models were generated on the basis of 66 biphenyl compounds.21,22 Their structures and corresponding IC50 values in nM
are shown in Table 1 and Figure S1. Maestro was used to build
the molecular structures, and the “Pharmacophore Modeling”
module of Phase was used to generate pharmacophore models.49,50 Before pharmacophore generation, the IC50 value of each
compound expressed in μM was converted to the corresponding
negative logarithm (pIC50), which were all in the range
−1.04 to 2.30; for each molecule, multiple conformers were
generated and optimized by performing energy minimization using the
OPLS-200530 force. In the next step, the
ConfGen module51 was used to explore the
conformational space using 100 conformers per rotatable bond and a
maximum of 1000 conformers per structure. After the above steps, the
five most active compounds with pIC50 >1.7 were used
to
generate pharmacophore models. The features such as hydrogen-bond
acceptor and donor, hydrophobic, negative, positive, and aromatic
rings were employed. In our study, pharmacophores with a maximum of
five features that match all active ligands were generated and were
further scored using default parameters.

Three-Dimensional-QSAR
Modeling
To generate the 3D-QSAR
models, we can either choose an atom- or a pharmacophore-based approach.
Here we choose the atom-based 3D-QSAR model as it includes the entire
molecular space of the compounds, whereas in the pharmacophore-based
3D-QSAR the regions beyond the pharmacophore model are not considered.49,50 In this study, all 66 compounds in the data set were used to develop
a 3D-QSAR model. Those compounds were randomly divided into a training
set and a test set, which corresponds to 70 and 30% of the total compounds,
respectively, using an automated random selection tool in the Phase
module. Three maximum partial least square factors in the regression
model and 1 Å length of the sides of cubic volume elements were
used to generate the 3D-QSAR models. The detailed method for generating
pharmacophore and 3D-QSAR models in the Phase module has been outlined
previously.49,50

Drug Likeness and ADMET
Analysis of Biphenyl-Type Compounds
The QikProp module in
Schrödinger52,53 is widely used to calculate ADME/T
properties of various compounds
and to predict PK and physicochemical parameters that account for
“drugability” of a molecule in the drug selection process,
especially in preclinical trials. In this study, we calculated the
ADME/T parameters of the biphenyl-type inhibitors to fully understand
their molecular properties.
