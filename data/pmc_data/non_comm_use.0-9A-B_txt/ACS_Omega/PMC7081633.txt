Magnetic fields generated
by the nanosolenoids based on the (5,
3) and (10,7) gold nanotubes (AuNTs) 12–600 Å long with
numbers of Au atoms 20–2000 are calculated. The electron energy
levels of the finite length tubules were determined using the linearized
augmented cylindrical waves method with Born–von Karman cyclic
boundary conditions and on account of a helical symmetry of the AuNTs.
Using these data, the numbers of conducting channels NF and the low-temperature ballistic electron currents
in the finite AuNTs are determined, and finally, the magnetic fields B of the gold nanosolenoids are obtained. Due to the increase
in the number of conduction channels with the increase in the length
of the tubes, the internal magnetic field gradually increases from
1.6 T/V in a tubule with L = 12 Å up to 12 T/V
in a tube with L = 600 Å, slowly approaching
the magnetic field of 14 T/V of the infinite (5, 3) AuNT. At a distance
of 5 Å from the ends of the tubes (near z = L/2 – 5 Å), this field decreases rapidly, halving
at z = L/2 and almost zeroing near z = L/2 + 5 Å. The field from the
outside of the tubes is weak but not zero as in the infinite tubule.
It is minimal at z = 0 and reaches a maximum at the
edge of the AuNTs, where it is about 3–4 times less than the
internal field. These results pave the way for a more realistic design
of the nanosolenoids.

I Introduction
Advancement
of nanotechnology has greatly accelerated the miniaturization
of electronic components and devices. This progress resulted in growing
interest in a design of the nanoscale electromagnets and inductors,
in which a helicoidal electron flow through a nanowire generates the
magnetic fields. However, to date, a very small number of such elements
have been proposed outside the framework of conversional silicon technology.
It was suggested that the chiral graphene nanoribbons or nanotubes
can be properly organized in a form of nanosolenoids to yield the
helicoidal currents and magnetic fields strong, confined, and tunable
by the nanomaterial composition, chirality, and diameter.1−8 However, the ideal carbon (n1, n2) nanotubes are not quite suitable for this
since the nanosolenoids require materials with a metallic type of
conductivity, but such tubules with n1 – n2 indivisible by 3 are dielectrics
and those with n1 – n2 divisible by 3 are essentially metallic, but the band
gaps usually emerge in this case due to the effects of the cylindrical
surface curvature.8−11 Thus, the chemically modified tubules are to be used for these purposes.
For example, the nanosolenoids based on a hetero-nanotube consisting
of the spiral carbon and boron nitride strips were proposed, and their
electrical and magnetic properties were calculated.1 An electromagnetic conversion in the solenoid in a form
of the helical graphene nanostructures joined in a single layer wound
around a dislocation line was suggested and theoretically studied,
too.2 As examples of pure carbon-based
materials, one can also cite the nanometer-sized graphite helical
structures, which behave as a collection of individual, closely packed
nanosolenoids,4 some graphene spiral structures,5 and the various helically coiled nanotubes with
very complex structures.6,7 The large magnetic fields
are anticipated to be realized using solenoids with the carbon nanotubes-copper
composite materials.8 Finally, our previous
calculations show that much more efficient nanosolenoids are possible
if one turns from carbon to the chiral gold nanotubes (AuNTs).12 Note that, in all previous calculations, the
not quite realistic models of the infinite nanosolenoids were considered
when the end effects were neglected.

Back in 2003, the 5 nm
long (5, 3) AuNTs were successfully synthesized
by electron beam thinning of a gold foil in an electron microscope.13 The atomic geometry of single-walled AuNTs resembles
that of the carbon tubules, where the honeycomb network of the C atoms
is replaced by the triangular network of the Au atoms with a Au–Au
bong length equal to 2.9 Å. Over the past years, there was great
progress in the synthesis of AuNTs. The single-walled and multiwalled
tubules and rings were obtained;14−19 in the latter, the length and diameter are of the same order of
magnitude. Knowledge of their properties expanded very significantly.
They exhibit distinct electrical, optical, electrochemical, transport,
and catalytic properties.14−25 Their use for solving the problems of enantioseparation, protein
and immunosensing, DNA detection, and photothermal cell ablation is
discussed in a recent review.17

The
purpose of this work is to calculate and plot the radial and
axial magnetic fields within and outside the finite chiral AuNT nanosolenoids.
The analysis was carried out on the example of (5, 3) AuNTs 12–600
Å long with the numbers of Au atoms between 20 and 1000. For
comparison, the analogous data for the (10, 7) AuNTs are presented
in the Supporting Information. We hope
that these results pave the way for a more realistic design of the
nanosolenoids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
of the finite-length nanosolenoid where the fringe effects were not
ignored.1−12 It is shown that the magnetic fields of the finite nanosolenoids
can be an order of magnitude smaller than the field of infinite ones,
and spatial distribution of fields is more complex.

II Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows a
nanotube in contact with two electrodes. According to Ampère’s
law, for the infinite-length solenoids, the magnetic field B = μnj inside the tubules does not
depend on their diameters and on the distance from the axis but only
on the current j and the number n of its turns per unit length, the field lines being parallel the
tube axis. This is not so for the finite continuous solenoids, and
the formulas for magnetic field in this case are somewhat more complex.
They are presented below in the Method of Calculation section.

Figure 1 Finite-length gold nanosolenoid and magnetic field created described
using field lines.

Figure 2 shows the
energy level diagrams of the finite (5, 3) AuNTs. The energy reference
point is located at the highest occupied levels. The highest levels
play a role of the Fermi level in the finite-length nanotubes; the
ballistic electronic transport is carried out through these levels
at low temperatures and applied voltages. In tubes with lengths L = 12 and 24 Å, there is one such level (NF = 1), and NF = 2 and 3 in
tubes with L = 60 and 120 Å, respectively, which
in all cases is significantly smaller than NF = 8 for the infinite (5, 3) AuNT.12 In proportion to the decrease in the NF values by 8, 4, and 2.7 times, the current should decrease when
switching to the short tubes. In the (5, 3) gold tubule 600 Å
long, the value of NF = 7 approaches the NF = 8 value of the infinite tube.

Figure 2 Electron energy
levels of finite AuNTs.

Figure 3 shows the
dependences of the magnetic field on the coordinates z and ρ of (5, 3) AuNTs with lengths L of 12–600
Å. Due to the increase in the number of conduction channels with
the increase in the length of the tubules, the internal magnetic field
gradually increases from 1.6 T/V in tubes with lengths L = 12 and 24 Å to the 3, 5, and 12 T/V in tubes with L = 60, 120, and 600 Å, slowly approaching the magnetic
field of 14 T/V of the infinite (5, 3) AuNT.12 In the free space inside the finite tubules, the magnetic field
depends on the distance ρ from the tube’s axis and z coordinate. At a distance of about 5 Å from the end
of the tubes (near z = L/2 –
5 Å), this field begins to decrease rapidly, halving at z = L/2 and almost zeroing near z = L/2 + 5 Å. The field from the
outside of the tubes is weak but not zero as in the case of the infinite
tubule. It is minimal at z = 0 and reaches a maximum
at the edge of the AuNTs at z = L/2, where it is about 3–4 times less than the internal field.

Figure 3 Magnetic
fields of (5, 3) AuNTs; insets show the fields near the
edges of three longer tubules. Field lines are calculated for free
space bounded by van der Waals tube dimensions. The dotted lines indicate
the edges of tubes. Here, (1) ρ = 0 corresponds to the nanotube
center; (2) ρ = (a – rvdW)/2 = 1.15 Å corresponds to the space between
the axis and inner van der Waals border of the tubule (here, rvdW = 0.9 Å is the van der Waals radius
of the gold atom); (3) ρ = a – rvdW = 2.3 Å is the inner van der Waals
boundary; (4) for ρ = a, the field is calculated
outside the fringe of tubes for z ≥ L/2 + 0.9 Å; (5) ρ = a + rvdW = 4.1 Å is the outer van der Waals
boundary; (6) ρ = 6 Å; (7) ρ
= 9 Å.

In addition to the magnetic field,
the finite solenoids are characterized
by a self-induction , which is
calculated by the formula  = μn2SL. The self-induction depends
only on the length L and cross section area S = πa2 of the solenoids
but not on the current or
operational voltage; for example,  is equal
to about 10–13 H for the tubule with L = 60 Å having about
the 100 Au atoms.

III Concluding Remarks
The magnetic fields generated by the chiral (5, 3) AuNT-based nanosolenoids
are calculated. The relationships between the tubule’s length,
their electron energy levels, ballistic transport, and magnetic fields
of solenoids are analyzed. The transition from the infinite to finite
tubes is accompanied by the change of the dispersion electron curves
in the Fermi level region for the discrete electronic spectrum, by
the decrease in the number of electron transport channels, and by
the weakening of the magnetic field of the solenoids. These results
can be considered as yet another manifestation of the fundamental
mechanism of the change in the metallic properties of an extended
material to the molecular properties of nanoparticles, which has been
noted recently in ref (34). In the 12 Å long (5, 3) AuNTs containing about 100 Au atoms,
the magnetic field is 8 times smaller than that in the infinite tubule.
The magnetic field reaches the maximum in the center of the finite
tubes and quickly decreases at a distance of ±5 Å from their
edges. The data for the (10, 7) AuNTs presented in the Supporting Information reasonably agree with
magnetic properties of the (5, 3) tubules.

IV Method
of Calculation
Following the methods described elsewhere,26,27 consider a single circular current on a surface of an imaginary
cylinder of radius a and length L, with its centroid at the origin of a cylindrical coordinate system
ρ, θ, z and its axis aligned with the z direction (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Single circular current j on an imaginary cylindrical
surface.

The magnetic field B due to this coil is given in
terms of the vector potential A by 1  

Only the Aθ component can be
nonzero due to the cylindrical symmetry; therefore, eq 1 for the radial and axial components
yields 2  and Bθ = 0. For a single circular current j, one has 3  where R is
the distance from the local point on the current circle to the field
point. For the continuous solenoids made up of a series of n circular currents per unit length 4  where l is
the axial distance from the coordinate origin. On integrating with
respect to l, there follows 5  where ξ± = z ± L/2. From this equation,
the field components can now be directly found26,27 6   7  

Equations 6 and 7 describe the
magnetic field in terms of the geometry
characteristics a, L, and n of the solenoid. For the (5, 3) AuNTs, a = 2.3 Å, n = 1.74,12 and the nanotube lengths L were varied between
12 and 600 Å in this work. The numerical results were found by
integrating these equations on a computer. It remains to find out
the electron current j.

The length of AuNTs
determines the electrons tunneling between
the cathode and anode through the nanomaterial. According the Landauer
formalism28,29 applied successfully to the gold nanowires
and tubules in refs (30) and (31), at low
temperatures, the current j depends on the numbers
of conducting channels at the Fermi level NF and applied voltage U 8  

The constant G0 = 7.748 × 10–5 Ω–1 is called the conduction
quantum. It remains to obtain the NF values
for the AuNTs. For this, we calculated the electronic energy levels
of the tubules of various lengths. (Recall that NF = n1 + n2 for the infinite (n1, n2) AuNTs12).

As in the previous calculation of the band structure of infinite
AuNTs, the energy levels of the finite-length tubules were calculated
by the linearized augmented cylindrical waves (LACW) method.11,32,33 The Born–von Karman cyclic
boundary conditions and helical symmetry of the AuNTs were used, which
allows one to determine the monatomic unit cell and describe the geometry
of finite tubes as a result of helical translations of only one Au
atom. The LACW method described in detail elsewhere is just a reformulation
of the linear augmented plane-wave (LAPW) technique well-known in
the theory of solids for the case of tubular multiatomic systems.
It applies the muffin-tin and local density approximations for the
electron potential, and the nanotube electronic structure is determined
by the free electron movement in the cylindrical monoatomic layer
and by electrons scattering on the atomic potentials, the structural
information being used as input data.
