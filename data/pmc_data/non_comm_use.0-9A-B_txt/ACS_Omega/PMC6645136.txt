Two organometallic ligands L1 (trans-[p-MeSC6H4C≡C-Pt(PR3)2-C≡CC6H4SMe; R = Me]) and L2 (R = Et) react
with CuX salts (X = Cl, Br, I) in MeCN to form one-dimensional (1D)
or two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymers (CPs). The clusters
formed with copper halide can either be step cubane Cu4I4, rhomboids Cu2X2, or simply CuI.
The formed CPs with L1, which is less sterically demanding
than L2, exhibit a crystallization solvent molecule (MeCN),
whereas those formed with L2 do not incorporate MeCN
molecules in the lattice. These CPs were characterized by X-ray crystallography,
thermogravimetric analysis, IR, Raman, absorption, and emission spectra
as well as photophysical measurements in the presence and absence
of crystallization MeCN molecules for those CPs with the solvent in
the lattice (i.e., [(Cu4I4)L1·MeCN]n (CP1), [(Cu2Br2)L1·2MeCN]n (CP3), and [(Cu2Cl2)L1·MeCN]n (CP5)). The crystallization molecules
were removed under vacuum to evaluate the porosity of the materials
by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (N2 at 77 K). The
2D CP shows a reversible type 1 adsorption isotherm for both CO2 and N2, indicative of microporosity, whereas the
1D CPs do not capture more solvent molecules or CO2.

Introduction
The use of organometallic
ligands for the synthesis of coordination
polymers1 (CPs) and metal-organometallic
frameworks (MOFs), mostly aimed at catalytic purposes,2 has been the topic of a relatively recent interest. In
parallel, the incorporation of S-containing moieties into organometallic
fragments has been a long-standing approach in ligand design,3 and sulfur-containing organics are also well
known to assemble Cu(I)-containing species to form one-dimensional
(1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional coordination polymers.4 Concurrently, the use of the rigid and readily
modulable trans-bisacetynylplatinum(II) synthon −C6H4C≡C–Pt(PR3)2–C≡CC6H4– (R = simple
alkyls or aryls) [Pt] for the preparation of organometallic
polymers has been thoroughly investigated in the past decades, mostly
to shine light on their photonic and electrochemical properties and
to design light-harvesting and light-emitting devices.5−9 The approach of anchoring of a S-containing residue onto a [Pt] scaffold has been recently performed and used to prepare
2D networks containing Ag nanoparticles.10 The strategy in this case was to generate the corresponding dithiolates,11 which exhibit a different affinity with metals
in comparison to the softer thioethers. These materials were not designed
for their ability to capture small molecules like MOFs but rather
to exploit their assembling ability10 and
electronic conductivity.11

In a recent
study on 1D and 2D coordination polymers generated
by luminescent CuI clusters and flexible RC6H4S(CH2)8SC6H4R (R = t-Bu, Me, respectively) dithioethers, the presence of macrocycles
within their framework has been revealed.12 Despite their low porosity, these materials exhibit the reversible
removal of small molecules, such as nitriles, MeOH, and CO2, suggesting that they somewhat act like MOFs. However, the major
challenge for these materials is that the combination of mono- and
dithioethers with CuX salts (X = Cl, Br, I, CN) stubbornly leads to
a complete unpredictability of the outcome of the Cu cluster acting
as the node and the dimensionality of the coordination polymer.4

We now report the design of two series
of coordination polymers
prepared from CuX salts (X = Cl, Br, I) and trans-MeSC6H4C≡C-Pt(PR3)2-C≡CC6H4SMe (R = Me (L1), Et (L2)) in MeCN, where two trends are observed.
First, the dimensionality of the resulting polymers is not affected
whether R = Me or Et. Second, the polymers formed with L1 reveal the presence of crystallization MeCN molecules in the lattice,
whereas those formed with L2 do not, despite the identical
nature of some of these materials (notably [(Cu2X2)L1]n and [(Cu2X2)L2]n; X =
Cl, Br).

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Structure Description
L1 and L2 differ only by their R group, Me versus Et. On the basis of past
experience, such a subtle difference usually leads to a major variability
in nature of the copper(I) cluster (often referred to as secondary
building unit; SBU) and polymer dimensionality when flexible chains
are used in the thioether ligands.4a−4c,19 This is not the case for the rigid L1 and L2 with CuX (X = Cl, Br), which lead in all four cases to 1D polymers CP3–CP6 (Scheme 1, Tables 1 and 2, and Figure 1). These materials belong to
a category of coordination polymers previously reported for the trans-bis(phenylacetylnyl)bis(triphenylphosphine)platinum(II)
complex, where rhomboid-type SBUs are anchored via a η2–C≡C coordination bonds (Cu2Br2 and Ag2(CF3SO3)2).13,14,15 During the course of this study,
the X-ray structure of L2 was obtained (SI) and is found to be consistent with that in the literature,7j,16 without any
further description.

Conclusively, there is
a clear selectivity favoring the ethynyl unit over the thioether by
the Cu(I) cation. Moreover, L1 bears smaller PMe3 groups comparatively to PEt3 and so the voids
left by the former group are compensated by MeCN crystallization molecules.
This trend where L1 uses MeCN to occupy the empty spaces
is also noted for CuI salt (i.e., no MeCN in the lattice of CP2; Figure 2, Table 3). However,
two drastic differences are noted. First, the dimensionality is 2D
for both CPs via the use of S–Cu coordinations. Second, the
SBUs used by CP1 and CP2 also differ. The
former uses the known step cubane SBU, and the latter material assembles
through a mononuclear Cu–I complex. To the best of our knowledge,
the use of a single Cu–I SBU is unprecedented in the formation
of CPs built upon thioethers and CuX salts (X = Cl, Br, I, CN).4a−4c

One interesting structural feature is the significant distortion
that L1 and L2 experience upon coordination.
Indeed, the most notable structural deviations from an ideal geometry
are the C–C≡C angles. In L1 and L2, these angles are only within 4° from the linearity, but fall
in the range of approximately 153–169° in CP1–CP6 (Tables 4 and 5). These distortions are
also noted in the interplanar C6H4···C6H4 distances. In L1, this distance
is 0.88 Å but increases to distances varying from 1.48 to 3.19
Å for CP1 and CP4–CP6. In case of L2, CP2, and CP3, the C6H4 planes of the ligands form dihedral
angles with each other.

Thermal Stability
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
trace of L2 is used as comparison (see SI for traces and data). It exhibits two major weight losses
near 260 and 435 °C most likely corresponding to the loss of
one PEt3 (exp. ∼15%, calcd = 16%) and one C≡CC6H4SMe (exp. ∼ 26%, calcd = 21%), respectively.
These two plateaus represent a “fingerprint” observed
in all of the coordination polymers investigated. Neither L1 nor L2 exhibit crystallization molecules based on their
X-ray structures and so no weight loss associated with solvent losses
is observed (i.e., at lower temperature).

Conversely, the presence
of MeCN molecules is evident from the weight losses depicted in the
TGA traces for CP1 and CP3 in the vicinity
of 100 °C (Figure 3, see SI for data). The expected absence
of MeCN in the lattice of CP2, CP4, and CP6 is also obvious by the lack of weight loss in the 25–200
°C window. In addition, the effect of ν(C≡C) in
the two ligands (L1 and L2) on the formation
of CPs was monitored using IR and Raman (for L1, CP1, CP3, and CP5) spectroscopy
measurements. These values for the IR data are observed to be in the
range of ∼2108 cm–1 for L2CP1–CP6, whereas it was confirmed that
the Raman values for L1, CP1, CP3, and CP5 also fall in relatively the same range of
∼2108 cm–1 (see SI).

Figure 3 Top: Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of CP1; black = calculated from the single-crystal X-ray data, blue = measured
from (crushed) single crystals, and red = after removing the MeCN
crystallization molecule under vacuum. Bottom: CO2 (red;
at 273 K) and N2 (black; at 77 K) sorption isotherms for CP1, measured from single crystals. Closed circles = adsorption;
open circles = desorption.

Surprisingly, CP5 does not show any weight loss
associated
with the crystallization molecule. This is due to the crystal “instability”
of the latter, which exhibit quick evaporation of the solvent crystallization
molecules. The X-ray structure was obtained by selecting a suitable
crystal in the mother liquor and then dipping it in glue to avoid
solvent evaporation. For TGA analysis, the use of glue is obviously
impossible and the solvent is completely gone after about 1 day. Prior
to discussing the particularity of CP3 and CP5, the gas sorption of CP1 is presented.

Gas Sorption
Measurements and Solvent Removal of MeCN in CP1
Gas sorption isotherms (CO2 and N2) of CP1 at low pressure ranging between 0 and
1100 mbar (∼1.1 atm) were measured (Figure 4, bottom). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) data reveal that CP1 is weakly porous (Tables 5 and 6; a space-filling model of the X-ray structure is given in the SI). The CO2 sorption at 273 K and
N2 sorption at 77 K exhibit type 1 isotherms, which again
corroborate the presence of microporous materials. Moreover, despite
the low surface area of 79.5 m2/g for CP1 upon
removal of MeCN, this microporous material is still able to adsorb
up to 16.8 cm3/g STP of CO2 at ∼1.1 bar.

quickly to be observed. The TGA trace is the same as that for the
blue and red traces of CP3. We note that CP5 does not exhibit a plateau in this range.

The powder
XRD pattern of CP1 directly measured from
the resulting solid after the synthesis exhibits a close similarity
with the calculated one using X-ray data extracted from the single
crystal, thus confirming its identity. Upon removing the solvent under
vacuum (as monitored by TGA, Figure 4), the resulting powder XRD pattern exhibits only modest
modifications (at 2θ ≈ 10 and 42°, Figure 4), indicating that the polymer
structure is intact. More importantly, the peak positions (i.e., 2θ
values) remain unaffected within 0.2° upon removing the MeCN.
This result indicates that the 2D grid is rather rigid. The reversible
removal and reintroduction of the MeCN molecules in the framework
of CP1 was also monitored using the chromaticity measurements
as it is conveniently found emissive at 298 K (Figure 5). The chromaticity data undergo a slight
change upon removing the crystallization molecule (from the purple
dot to the black dot).

Figure 5 Top: Absorption (black), excitation (blue), and emission
(red)
spectra of CP1. Bottom: Chromaticity diagram of CP1 before (0.43270, 0.44875) and after removing MeCN (0.42015,
0.38006) and after reintroducing it from vapor (0.44754, 0.42595).

As shown, the emission spectrum
of CP1 is observed
to have a featureless broad band with maximum at 585 nm at room temperature.
This feature in these CPs has been previously reported by our group
and found to originate from the triplet state due to a large Stokes
shift between the absorption maximum with the emission peak. In addition,
on the basis of the previous DFT and time-dependent density functional
theory (TDDFT) calculations, the nature of the excited states for CP1 originates from both intra-L1 (intra-ligand
ππ* mixed with MLCT; M = Pt, L = π*–C≡CC6H4) and MXLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer,
Cu4I4 →L1; MX = Cu4I4; L = L1).17a,17b

Upon partial reintroduction
of the solvent (∼33% based on TGA data in Figure 4), the chromaticity data expectedly
exhibit again a slight modification moving almost in the direction
toward its original position in the chromaticity diagram (from the
black dot to the turquoise dot) in Figure 5. Thus, CP1 is capable of releasing
MeCN (and CO2), but the uptake is difficult (i.e., slow).
Even though the uptake is lower than that in many microporous materials,
type I adsorption isotherm is observed.

Special Cases of CP3 and CP5
Both materials exhibit MeCN
crystallization molecules in their lattices
(Figure 1), but TGA
analyses indicate that there is no readsorption of the solvent after
removal for CP3 (Figure 4, right) and not at all for CP5 when the
single crystals are exposed to air for a certain time (SI).

In an attempt to figure out this particular
result, CP3 was subjected to necessary crushing for powder
XRD analysis, and the resulting pattern turned out to be completely
different from the calculated pattern extracted from its X-ray data
(Figure 6). This experiment
indicates that CP3 has changed during crushing, a resulting
structure exhibiting no crystallization molecules based on the TGA
traces (Figures 4).
In an attempt to figure out whether this mechanical stress induces
only an evaporation of the solvent without altering the 1D structure
of the polymer (as this was the case for CP1) (Figure 3), the experimental
powder XRD traces of CP3 were compared to the calculated
ones of CP4 and CP6 (Figure 7, bottom), two polymers for which no crystallization
molecules exist in the lattice even though L2 was used
for the synthesis of latter CPs.

Figure 6 Powder XRD patterns upon crushing single
crystals (blue), calculated
(black), after MeCN removal (red), and recovered from MeCN (green)
for CP3 (CP5 is provided in the SI).

Figure 7 Powder XRD patterns
upon crushing the single crystals (blue) and calculated (black) for CP2, CP4, and CP6.

The attempt was unsuccessful as there is no resemblance.
The conclusion
is that CP3 and CP5 are unstable with time,
temperature, and vacuum conditions as they lose the solvent meaning
these are kinetic products becoming thermodynamic ones because the
solvent does not reenter their lattice. Moreover, when these materials
are subjected to increased pressure from crushing, there is an irreversible
change of structure (i.e., new thermodynamic product). The latter
process could be the result of a combination of both losing the solvent
and leaving space for reorganization of the structure. Because the
structures of CP3 and CP5 are unknown after
subjecting them to these conditions, this possible explanation is
still speculative.

Crystal Transformation of CP3 and CP5
To determine whether there is transformation for CP3 and CP5, powder of CP3 after MeCN removal was redissolved
in MeCN and prismlike crystals similar to those obtained after synthesis
were formed. However, the powder XRD measurements confirmed that the
pattern of the recovered crystals from the initial powder is not identical
to the calculated PXRD pattern. These crystals were only verified
by PXRD, which indicated that the molecule is not identical (Figure 6, green line).

Therefore, this speculation of the crystal transformation for CP3 and CP5 upon solvent removal is assumed to
be correct because the obtained single crystals after redissolving
in MeCN showed also different PXRD patterns from any previous ones
(Figure 6).

On
the other hand, PXRD patterns for CP2, CP4, and CP6 as synthesized were compared to the calculated
PXRD patterns and found to be identical (Figure 7). This clearly indicates that CP2, CP4, and CP6 do not undergo any crystal
transformation upon crushing. In addition, the fact that these do
not incorporate the solvent in the cavity means that they do not collapse.
Therefore, we can conclude that the 1D CPs (CP3 and CP5) with MeCN in the voids will not hold the solvent for
long as the acetonitrile seems to evaporate upon crushing the crystals.

Conclusions
Ligand design going from L1 to L2 (i.e.,
PMe3 to PEt3) permitted to generate 1D coordination
polymers without any crystallization solvent trapped in the voids.
The predictability comes in effect due to the length of alkyl chain
on the PEt3 of L2 as compared to L1, which has PMe3. Even though CP3–CP6 are identical as they are all coordinated in the same
fashion and are 1D CPs, CP3 and CP5 show
crystallization molecules (MeCN in their voids), whereas CP4 and CP6 have no crystallization molecule. This is so
because of the crystallization molecules which will occupy the voids
available for the polymers made with L1 as there is a
short alkyl chain (i.e., PMe3), whereas for the polymers
made from L2, no solvent occupies the voids due to steric
hindrance of the alkyl chain (i.e., PEt3) and thus resulting
in more compact lattice as there is no space available for the solvent
to be trapped in. This phenomenon is illustrated by the formation
of a 2D CP1 when L1 is used, and MeCN is
seen trapped in the cavity when L2 forms a 1D CP2 and the cluster step cubane SBU has broken.

Gas Sorption Isotherm Measurements
Gas sorption isotherms
were measured using Micromeritics instrument “Accelerated Surface
Area and Porosimetry” (ASAP 2020) analyzer at low pressure
ranging between 0 and 1100 mbar (∼1.1 bar). Warm and cold free
space correction measurements were performed for the isotherms using
ultrahigh-purity He gas with purity of 99.999%. The other gases used
are of high grade with purities of 99.999 and 99.99% for N2 and CO2 gases, respectively. The measurements were performed
at 77 K for N2 gas, whereas for CO2 gas, the
measurements were performed at 273 K. Before performing the sorption
measurements, the samples were heated under reduced pressure of 600
mbar at 110 °C for approximately 6 h and their mass was measured.
Then, the samples were backfilled with N2 and transported
to the analysis port where further evacuation was done for 2 h before
starting the whole analysis. The surface area and pore volumes were
calculated by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)19,20b,21 and density functional theory
(DFT)20 models for N2 and CO2, respectively.

Important notice. Single
crystals were grown from evaporation of acetonitrile solutions. For
analyses, such as BET and TGA, the crystals were carefully selected
from the dried sample under a microscope. For powder diffraction and
luminescence analyses, these crystals were then crushed using a mortar
to introduce the powder inside the capillaries.

Instruments
Solid-state UV−vis were recorded
using a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer at 298 K with a grazing-angle
transmittance apparatus having a homemade 77 K sample holder. Steady-state
fluorescence and excitation spectra were measured on an Edinburgh
Instruments FL980 phosphorimeter equipped with single monochromators.
All samples were fished out as single crystals under the microscope
and were crushed prior to use. The steady-state fluorescence spectra
were recorded using a capillary. These spectra were corrected for
instrument response. The Edinburgh Instruments FL980 phosphorimeter
is equipped with a “flash” pulsed lamp. The repetition
rate of the pulse can be adjusted from 1 to 100 Hz. The instrument
was also used to measure the chromaticity. The TGA traces were acquired
on a PerkinElmer TGA 7 apparatus in the temperature range of 20−900
°C at 10 °C/ min under an argon atmosphere. The figures
were treated by Origin software.

X-ray Crystallography
A clear pale yellow prismlike
single crystal of L2 was measured on a Bruker Apex DUO
system equipped with a Cu Kα ImuS microfocus source with MX
optics (λ = 1.54186 Å). Clear light yellow prismlike single
crystals of CP1, CP3, and CP6; a clear intense yellow prismlike single crystal of CP2, a clear pale orange prismlike single crystal of CP4, and a clear light orange prismlike single crystal of CP5 were measured on a Bruker Kappa APEX II DUO CCD system equipped
with a TRIUMPH curved crystal monochromator and a Mo fine-focus tube
(λ = 0.71073 Å). Diffraction data were recorded at 173
K for L2, CP1, CP2, CP3, CP4, CP5, and CP6. A total
of 797 frames were collected for L2, CP1, CP2, CP3, CP4, CP5, and CP6. The frames were integrated with the Bruker
SAINT22 software package using a narrow-frame
algorithm for all CPs and a wide-frame alogarithm was used for L2. Data were corrected for absorption effects using the multiscan
method (SADABS).22 The structures were
solved and refined using the Bruker SHELXTL software package using
space group P1 with Z = 1 for L2, space group P1̅ with Z = 2 for CP1, space group P1̅,
with Z = 1 for CP4, CP5, and CP6, space group P1211 with Z = 2 for CP2, and space
group P1 with Z = 1 for CP3. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters.
The hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and included
in final refinement in a riding model with isotropic temperature parameters
set to Uiso(H) = 1.5 Ueq(C). Crystal data, data collection, and structure
refinement of all compounds are presented in Table S1. Important notice: the crystal structures
of CP3 and CP5 undergo a phase change upon
crushing. The structure of the resulting materials is not known.

Powder XRD Measurements
Each sample of CP1–CP4 and CP6 were mixed with a small
amount of Paratone oil and cut to approximately 0.3 × 0.3 ×
0.3 mm3. The samples were placed on a sample holder, which
was then mounted on a Bruker APEX DUO X-ray diffractometer at 173
K. A total number of six correlated runs per sample were done with
φ scan of 360°. Each sample was then exposed to 270 s on
the Cu microfocus anode (1.54184 Å) and the CCD APEX II detector
at 150 mm distance. The runs were collected from −12 to −72°
2θ and 6 to 36° ω were treated and integrated with
the XRW2 Eval Bruker software to produce WAXD diffraction patterns
from 2.5 to 80° 2θ. The patterns were treated with Diffrac.Eva
version 2.0 from Bruker.

Procedure for Solvent Removal and Exposure
to Solvent Vapor
A small amount of polymers CP1, CP3,
and CP5 were inserted in small vials, and the crystallization
molecules were removed by heating under reduced pressure (600 mbar)
up to 110 °C for 6 h. The removal of the crystallization molecules
was confirmed with TGA measurements. The samples treated in this manner
were also inserted in small vials, which were then placed in a desiccator
containing solvent (MeCN) in a larger recipient. These vials were
exposed under reduced pressure (500 mbar) at room temperature for
2 days. For CP1, the reintroduction of the solvent was
possible, at least in part, but this was not the case for CP3 and CP5.
