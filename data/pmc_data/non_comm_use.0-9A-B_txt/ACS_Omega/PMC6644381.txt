Dehydrogenative
synthesis of esters from primary alcohols proceeded
efficiently over a ZrO2-supported copper catalyst. A variety
of esters were obtained from primary alcohols as well as diols in
good to high yields. The key to the dehydrogenative synthesis of esters
is the concerted effect of the acid–base pairs on ZrO2 and metallic copper.

1 Introduction
Ester
is one of the most important functionalities, and is found
in a wide range of valuable chemicals such as fibers, inks, solvents,
surfactants, fragrances, lubricants, food additives, and pharmaceuticals.1 Although the condensation of alcohols with activated
carbonyl compounds, such as acid chlorides and acid anhydrides, is
the most convenient method for the preparation of esters, a stoichiometric
amount of salt is inevitably formed as waste (eq 1 in Scheme 1). Also, in dehydrative condensation
of carboxylic acids with alcohols promoted by acid catalysts, the
addition of dehydrating agents is indispensable for the high-yield
production of esters (eq 2). On the other hand, the catalytic transformation
of alcohols to esters in a dehydrogenative manner is a promising method
thanks to the coproduction of only molecular hydrogen (eq 3).2,3 In 2005, Milstein and co-workers first demonstrated an efficient
and acceptorless dehydrogenative synthesis of esters from alcohols
through the use of ruthenium complexes bearing a pincer-type ligand
as catalysts.4 Following this breakthrough,
a series of homogeneous catalysts based on transition-metal complexes,
such as Ru,5−10 Rh,11 Ir,12 Re,13 Os,14 and Mn,15 have been developed. On the
other hand, efficient organic synthesis with heterogeneous catalysts
is of great significance from the perspective of green and sustainable
chemistry.16−20 Shimizu and co-workers reported that supported Pt catalysts were
effective for the dehydrogenative synthesis of esters.21,22 Recently, much attention has also been paid to the development of
an efficient catalytic system with abundant first-row transition metals.
Particularly, many examples have demonstrated that supported Cu catalysts
are highly effective for the dehydrogenative transformation of alcohols
to the corresponding carbonyl compounds.23−25 Dehydrogenative
synthesis of esters from alcohols has been achieved by the use of
supported Cu catalysts,26−30 and the availability of ZrO2 as a support for Cu-catalyzed
dehydrogenative synthesis of esters has also been explored. However,
the correlations of the surface property of ZrO2 with the
activity of Cu catalysts have not been fully understood.

Scheme 1 Synthetic
Routes to Esters from Alcohols
Herein, we describe the dehydrogenative synthesis of esters
from
primary alcohols in the presence of supported Cu catalysts. The supports
for the catalysts remarkably dominated the reaction efficiency and
selectivity, and ZrO2-supported catalysts gave the corresponding
esters with a high ester yield and selectivity. NH3- and
CO2-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD
and CO2-TPD) profiles revealed that metallic Cu and acid–base
pair sites on the surface of ZrO2 promoted the catalytic
transformation of primary alcohols to the corresponding esters with
high selectivity.

2 Results and Discussion
Supported Cu catalysts were prepared by a simple impregnation method.
An oxide support was impregnated in an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O at 80 °C for 2 h.
After drying, the resulting powder was calcined at 500 °C for
3 h under an air flow. Before being used in catalytic reactions, the
supported Cu catalysts was pretreated under a H2 flow (10
mL min–1) at 400 °C for 1 h to reduce the Cu
cation to metallic Cu.31

Table 1 summarizes
the results of the reaction of 1-octanol (1a, 1.5 mmol)
in the presence of supported Cu catalysts (1 mol % as metal) at 170
°C for 24 h in mesitylene. Among the supported Cu catalysts tested,
ZrO2-supported catalysts showed the highest conversion
of the alcohol and the highest yield of the corresponding ester, octyl
octanoate (2a). In all of the cases, the formation of
a small amount of octanal (3a) was confirmed. Despite
the high conversion of the alcohol, Al2O3-supported
Cu catalysts resulted in a very low yield of the ester because Lewis
acidic surface property of Al2O3 dominantly
promoted dehydrative coupling to give octyl ether as a main byproduct.
On the other hand, TiO2- and CeO2-supported
catalysts gave α,β-unsaturated ketone as a main byproduct
via the self-condensation of octanal. The effects of the supported
metallic species on the present reaction were also investigated, whereas
the reaction with Co, Ni, Ru, Pd, Ag, Ir, or Pt catalysts supported
on ZrO2 resulted in a lower conversion of the alcohol and
a lower yield of the ester than that with Cu/ZrO2. When
only ZrO2 was subjected to the catalytic reaction, no conversion
of 1a was confirmed. Although several Cu salts, such
as Cu(OAc)2, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, CuCl, CuCl2·2H2O, and Cu(OH)2, were employed as soluble or insoluble catalyst, no ester
was obtained. These results indicate that the combination of metallic
Cu and a ZrO2 support is essential for the selective formation
of esters from primary alcohols in a dehydrogenative manner. Note
that no leaching of Cu species into the solvent after the reaction
with Cu/ZrO2 catalysts was confirmed by the atomic emission
spectroscopic analysis.

a Reaction conditions: 1a (1.5 mmol), supported catalyst
(0.01 mmol as Cu), mesitylene (1.0
mL), at 170 °C, 24 h, under Ar.

b Yields (2a and 3a) and conversion (1a) were determined by gas–liquid
chromatography based on 1a.

Under the optimized reaction conditions, a series
of alcohols were
subjected to the dehydrogenative synthesis of esters over Cu(5 wt
%)/ZrO2 catalysts (Table 2). The reactions of aliphatic primary alcohols (1a–f) with a straight alkyl chain gave
the corresponding esters (2a–f) in
moderate to high yields. Cyclohexylmethanol (1g) and
3-phenyl-1-propanol (1h) could also participate in the
present catalytic system to afford 2g and 2h in high yields. The reaction of benzyl alcohol (1i)
resulted in 35% yield of benzyl benzoate (2i), whereas
an increased yield of 52% was obtained in the reaction with Cu/CeO2 catalyst. This is due to the higher reactivity of benzyl
alcohol than that of aliphatic alcohols. The rapid conversion of alcohol
to aldehyde reduces the amount of alcohols as the coupling reagent
to form hemiacetal, leading to a low yield of the corresponding ester.
In this respect, Cu/CeO2 is a suitable catalyst for the
dehydrogenative synthesis of esters from benzyl alcohol because the
catalyst shows moderate catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation
of alcohols. The reactions of diols were also examined, and the intramolecular
cyclization of 1,4-butanediol (1j) and 1,5-pentanediol
(1k) took place to give the corresponding lactones (2j and 2k) in high yields under diluted conditions.

Figure 1 shows the
time course of the reaction of 1a in the presence of
Cu/ZrO2 at 170 °C. At the initial stage of the reaction,
the rapid formation of octanal 3a was observed, and the
yield of the aldehyde gradually decreased after 5 h. In contrast,
the yield of ester 2a gradually increased with the passage
of time. This strongly suggests that aldehyde 3a was
an intermediate for the ester in the present reaction. Two reaction
pathways from aldehyde to ester can be assumed (Scheme 2); dimerization of aldehyde, the so-called
Tishchenko reaction (path A),32 and the
formation of hemiacetal via the condensation of aldehyde with alcohol,
followed by dehydrogenation (path B). The reaction of octanal (3a) in the presence of Cu/ZrO2 under the same reaction
conditions as in Table 1 resulted in a very low yield of 2a (Scheme 3). This strongly suggests that
the ester was furnished through path B. Furthermore, the formation
of aldehyde was observed (Figure 1), which indicates that the dehydrogenation of 1-octanol
was faster than the formation of ester. From this result and the general
considerations for very low equilibrium concentration of hemiacetals,
we can assume that the dehydrogenation of hemiacetal formed by the
condensation of aldehyde with alcohol is the rate-determining step.

Figure 1 Time course
of the reaction by Cu/ZrO2 catalyst.

Scheme 2 Reaction Pathway from Alcohol to Ester
It has become widely accepted that the activity of supported
Cu
catalysts for alcohol dehydrogenation is enhanced by the combination
of metallic nanoparticles and base sites on the support because the
basic nature of surface hydroxyl groups facilitates the dissociation
of the O–H bond of alcohol to form copper alkoxide species,
which are key intermediates for dehydrogenation.33−37 In sharp contrast, the formation of hemiacetals via
the condensation of carbonyl compounds with alcohols can be promoted
by Lewis or Brønsted acid catalysis. On the basis of these facts,
the coexistence of acid and base sites on the surface of the catalyst
must be crucial for the selective formation of ester from primary
alcohols. Hence, the surface acid–base amounts for each supported
Cu catalyst were estimated by NH3- or CO2-temperature-programmed
desorption (NH3-TPD or CO2-TPD).38

Figure 2 shows the
relationship between the amounts of both acid and base sites for the
supported Cu catalysts and the yields of ester 2a. Al2O3-, SiO2-, and TiO2-supported
catalysts had acid sites and much fewer base sites than ZrO2- and CeO2-supported catalysts. In contrast, the large
amounts of both acid and base sites were present on Cu/ZrO2 catalyst, implying that the acid–base pair sites and adjacent
metallic Cu species worked in concert as efficient catalysts for the
formation of esters. Figure 3 shows the correlation between the yield of ester 2a and the amount of acid–base pair sites per unit surface area
in each supported Cu catalyst. In this case, the amount of acid–base
pair sites was defined as the lesser acid and base sites. For example,
the amounts in the ZrO2-, Al2O3-,
TiO2-, and SiO2-supported catalysts were equivalent
to those of base sites, whereas the amount of acid–base pair
sites in Cu/CeO2 was equivalent to that of the acid sites.
As shown in Figure 3, the yield of ester is closely correlated with the amount of acid–base
pair sites in each supported Cu catalyst, suggesting that the selective
formation of esters from primary alcohols must be dominated by the
synergetic function of the surface acid–base pair sites with
adjacent metallic Cu species. Such amphoteric functions of ZrO2 have been widely applied in the transformation of organic
molecules, such as Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction39−41 and CO2 fixation into alcohols,42−44 and it is generally
accepted that a Zr center and surface hydroxyl groups serve as the
acid and base sites, respectively.39−41

the yield of 2a (•) in Table 1 and the amount of
acid (white squares with black background) and base (chessboard pattern)
on the catalysts.

Figure 3 Relationship between
the yield of 2a and the amount
of acid–base pair sites on the catalysts.

On the basis of these considerations, a possible reaction
mechanism
for the transformation of primary alcohols to the corresponding esters
is proposed, as follows (Scheme 4). The base sites on the ZrO2 surface promote
the dissociation of the O–H bond to form copper alkoxide. Subsequently,
β-hydride elimination gives aldehyde together with copper hydride
species, followed by the coupling of hydride with a proton on the
surface hydroxyl group to generate molecular hydrogen. The Lewis acidic
Zr center activates aldehyde, which promotes the condensation with
alcohols to furnish hemiacetal. Finally, the thus-formed hemiacetal
is dehydrogenated by the adjacent surface base and metallic Cu to
give the final product ester. A detailed mechanistic investigation
by spectroscopic techniques is currently underway in our laboratory.

Scheme 3 Reaction of 3a with Cu/ZrO2
Scheme 4 Proposed Reaction Mechanism
Finally, reusability of Cu/ZrO2 catalyst was
investigated
(Table 3). Unfortunately,
severe deactivation of the Cu/ZrO2 catalyst was observed
after the catalytic reaction. The reaction of 1a by the
recovered Cu/ZrO2 without any regenerative treatment resulted
in very low yield of 2a. In contrast, before being subjected
to the repeated use, the recovered catalyst was treated with air calcination
and H2 reduction. As a result, the regenerated Cu/ZrO2 catalyst gave 2a in an improved yield, whereas
the activity of the catalyst was not fully recovered. As described
above, a number of acid–base pair sites are crucial for high activity of
the catalyst and high selectivity of the reactions. Such pair sites
might be diminished during the catalytic reactions in an organic solvent,
and they cannot be recovered even though the used catalysts were calcined
at high temperatures under the air-flow conditions. Further investigation
on the catalyst regeneration is now in progress.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the dehydrogenative synthesis of esters from primary
alcohols under mild reaction conditions was achieved by the use of
a ZrO2-supported Cu catalyst. A variety of esters were
obtained from primary alcohols as well as diols in good to high yields.
Both NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD profiles revealed that
the concerted functions of the acid–base pair sites and metallic
Cu on the surface of ZrO2 should be responsible for the
selective formation of esters.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Cu(OAc)2, CuCl, CuCl2·2H2O, and Cu(OH)2 were purchased
from Wako Chemicals. Al2O3 (Sumitomo Chemical
Co., Ltd, AKP-G015; JRC-ALO-8 equivalent), TiO2 (JRC-TIO-4),
ZrO2 (JRC-ZRO-3), CeO2 (JRC-CEO-2), and SiO2 (JRC-SIO-9A) were obtained from the Catalysis Society of
Japan. Other organic substrates, alcohols and aldehydes, were of analytical
grade and used as received from TCI without further purification.

4.2 Physical and Analytical Measurements
The
products of the catalytic Cuns were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) (Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010, CBP-10 capillary
column, i.d. 0.25 mm, length 30 m, 50–250 °C) and gas
chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014, CBP-10 capillary column, i.d. 0.25
mm, length 30 m, 50–250 °C). NMR spectra were recorded
on a JMN-ECS400 (FT, 400 MHz (1H), 100 MHz (13C)) instCument. Chemical shifts (δ) of 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra are referenced to SiMe4.

The supported catalysts were analyzed by temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD), N2 adsorption, and X-ray diffraction
(XRD). NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD were carried out
to estimate the amount of acid and base on the catalysts. The TPD
was performed on a MicrotracBEL BELCAT-II in the following manners:
100 mg of powder was reduced with H2 (50 mL min–1) gas at 400 °C for 1 h. Then, the temperature was kept for
1 h in He (50 mL min–1) gas (CO2-TPD:
the sample was heated at the rate of 10 °C min–1 up to 500 °C, and the temperature was kept for 1 h in He gas).
The sample was cooled down to 100 °C in He gas. Gaseous NH3/He (5/45 mL min–1) was adsorbed for 1 h
and then removed in He gas for 1 h. Consecutively, NH3-TPD
was started at 100 °C, and the temperature was raised to 800
°C at a ramping rate of 10 °C min–1 under
the He gas flow. The products desorbed were determined by using a
BELMass and recorded on an online personal computer. CO2-TPD was also carried out in a similar manner using CO2 gas. X-ray powder diffraction analyses were performed using Cu Kα
radiation and a one-dimensional X-ray detector (SmartLab, Rigaku).
The samples were scanned from 2θ = 10–70° at a scanning
rate of 10° s–1 and a resolution of 0.01°.
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area was
estimated from the N2 isotherms obtained using a BELSORP-mini
II (BEL Japan, Osaka, Japan) at 77 K. The analyzed samples were evacuated
at 573 K for 2 h prior to the measurement. The contents of copper
species leached into reaction solvent were determined by the atomic
emission spectroscopic analysis with a SHIMADZU AA-6200.

4.3 Experimental Procedure
4.3.1 Typical Preparation of
a Support Cu Catalyst
Supported catalysts were prepared by
the impregnation method. A
1.0 g of support was added to the aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O in air at 353 K. After impregnation,
the resulting powder was calcined in air at 773 K for 3 h to afford
a supported Cu catalyst. Supported Ni, Co, Cu, Pd, Ag, Ir, and Pt
catalysts were prepared in a similar manner.

4.3.2 Representative
Procedure for Dehydrogenative
Synthesis of Ester from Primary Alcohol
Dehydrogenative coupling
of 1-octanol was carried out in a batch-type reactor (20 mL Pyrex
tube). Cu/ZrO2 catalyst (100 mg, 1 mol % as Cu) was reductive
pretreated in a H2 flow (10 mL min–1)
at each temperature for 1 h in the reactor (Cu, Pd, and Pt catalysts
at 423 K, Co, Cu, and Ir catalysts at 673 K, Ni catalyst at 773 K).
Then, 1-octanol (1.5 mmol) and mesitylene (1.0 mL) were added to the
reactor. The reaction was carried out at 443 K under Ar atmosphere.
The products were quantified by gas chromatography using an internal
standard technique.

4.3.3 Recycling of the Cu/ZrO2 Catalyst
After the reaction, the solid was separated
from the reaction mixture
by centrifugation and washed with 10 mL of diethyl ether, methanol/H2O (1:1), and again by diethyl ether. The resulting solid was
dried overnight at 80 °C and calcined in air at 400 °C for
30 min to recover the Cu/ZrO2 catalyst for reuse. Before
catalytic reactions, the supported Cu catalyst was subjected to reductive
pretreatment in a H2 flow at 400 °C for 1 h.
