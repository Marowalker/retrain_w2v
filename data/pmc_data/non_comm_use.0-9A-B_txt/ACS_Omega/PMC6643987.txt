This work uncovered the regio/site-selective
benzoylation of 1,2-
and 1,3-diols and glycosides containing a cis-vicinal
diol using a catalytic amount of FeCl3 with the assistance
of acetylacetone. FeCl3 may initially form [Fe(acac)3] (acac = acetylacetonate) with excess acetylacetone in the
presence of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in acetonitrile at room
temperature. Then, benzoylation was catalyzed by Fe(acac)3 with added benzoyl chloride in the presence of DIPEA under mild
conditions as reported. This reaction produced selectivities and isolated
yields similar to or slightly lower than the reaction using Fe(acac)3 as a catalyst in most cases. The result provides not only
the green and convenient selective benzoylation method associated
with the most inexpensive catalysts but also the possibility that
the effects of various metal salts and ligands on the regioselective
protection can be extensively investigated in future study to obtain
the optimized catalytic system.

Introduction
Regio/site-selective
protection strategy remains a central challenge
in carbohydrate chemistry.1 Methods using
organotin reagents used to be widely applied on regioselective protection
strategies.2 However, green reagents have
to be developed to substitute organotins because of the potentially
inherent toxicity of organotin reagents.3 One of the best reagents is [Fe(dibm)3] (dibm = diisobutyrylmethane)
which was identified by our group in 2016.4 In the most recent, we have further identified [Fe(acac)3] (acac = acetylacetonate) as a catalyst for selective acylation
(Figure 1a).5 This [Fe(acac)3]-catalyzed selective
acylation method is environment-friendly and is associated with more
convenient manipulation, higher efficiency and selectivity, better
yields, and broad substrate scope compared to all previously reported
methods, including the use of reduced amounts of organotins,6 heavy metal-based complexes,7 chiral catalysts,3e,3j,8 and other nonmetallic catalysts3a,3g,9 and reagents.3i,10 However, we have not
been able to explore the mechanism because it is difficult to obtain
the crystal structure of intermediate or to proceed NMR studies for
subjects containing iron element. We hypothesized that FeCl3 initially form [Fe(acac)3] (acac = acetylacetonate) with
excess acetylacetone in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA)
and then the acylation should be catalyzed by Fe(acac)3 with added acylation reagents in acetonitrile under mild conditions.
If the reaction is feasible, it indicates that FeCl3 can
be used directly as a catalyst to catalyze the regioselective protection
in the presence of both dibm/acetylacetone and a base. We can extensively
investigate the effects of various metal salts and ligands on the
regioselective protection to obtain the optimized catalytic system
in future study. The catalytic mechanism may also be further explored
by NMR study once the nonferrous metal salts are optimized instead
of the iron catalyst. This challenge was addressed in the present
study (Figure 1b),
where FeCl3 as the catalyst, with the assistance of acetylacetone,
was successfully used for selective benzoylation of 1,2-diols, 1,3-diols,
and glycosides containing a cis-vicinal diol, but
failed in acetylation. Selectivities and isolated yields similar to
or slightly lower than the reaction using Fe(acac)3 as
a catalyst were obtained in most cases. FeCl3 is a very
common and inexpensive reagent in the laboratory. Therefore, the result
not only provides the green and convenient selective benzoylation
method associated with an inexpensive catalyst but also opens a gate
for us to find the best catalytic system of regioselective protection
and explore its mechanism.

Results and Discussion
The Fe(acac)3-catalyzed acylation of diols and polyols
exhibits high regioselectivity as described.5 Logically, we expected that FeCl3 with the assistance
of acetylacetone would show similar catalytic activity to Fe(acac)3 in the regioselective acylation. In order to verify this
hypothesis, methyl-6-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-α-d-mannopyranoside 1 was chosen as the first substrate
(Table 1). When 0.1
equiv of Fe(acac)3 were used as the catalyst in the presence
of 1.5 equiv of DIPEA in acetonitrile, 85% yield of 3-O-benzoated product 2 was isolated from the benzoylation
of compound 1 with 1.2 equiv of benzoyl chloride (BzCl)
(entry 1). It is hypothesized that 0.1 equiv of FeCl3 and
0.31 equiv of acetylacetone are required in order to obtain similar
catalytic effect to 0.1 equiv of Fe(acac)3. Therefore,
0.1 equiv of FeCl3 were initially mixed with 0.31 equiv
of acetylacetone in the presence of excess amount (0.6 equiv) of DIPEA
in acetonitrile. After 10 min, compound 1, the other
1.5 equiv of DIPEA and 1.5 equiv of BzCl were added successively.
After 8 h reaction at room temperature, product 2 was
isolated in 80% yield (entry 2), indicating the similar catalytic
effect of FeCl3 with the assistance of acetylacetone to
Fe(acac)3 in the regioselective benzylation. Next, 0.1
equiv of FeCl3, 0.31 equiv of acetylacetone, 2.1 equiv
of DIPEA, compound 1, and 1.5 equiv of BzCl were successively
added in acetonitrile without the premixing of FeCl3, acetylacetone
and DIPEA. After 8 h of reaction at room temperature, product 2 was also isolated in 80% yield (entry 3), indicating that
the effects of the two feed methods of DIPEA on the reaction are identical.
The used amounts of DIPEA were optimized in the following experiments
(entries 4–6), indicating that 1.9 equiv of DIPEA is the optimum
amount. With the used amounts of DIPEA reduced, the reaction proceeded
slowly and more starting material 1 were recovered after
8 h of reaction (entries 5 and 6). Compared with the use of 1.5 equiv
of BzCl, when 1.2 equiv of BzCl were used, product 2 was
isolated in 61% yield and the starting material 1 was
recovered in 27% yield after 8 h reaction (entry 7). Considering the
reaction equilibrium between FeCl3 and acetylacetone, we
increased the amount of one of the two materials (entries 8 and 9).
Interestingly, 0.4 equiv of acetylacetone showed slightly negative
effect on the reaction (entry 8); whereas 0.2 equiv of FeCl3 showed slightly positive effect on the reaction (entry 9). Whether
the absence of FeCl3 (entry 10), the absence of acetylacetone
(entry 11), or the absence of both FeCl3 and acetylacetone
(entry 12) led to low conversion of the reaction and poor selectivity
(2/2a: 2.5/1–3/1), indicating the
key roles of FeCl3 and acetylacetone on reaction rate and
good selectivity (2/2a: 4.2/1 in entry 4).
The attempts of using other bases instead of DIPEA were also carried
out (entries 13–16). A good result was also observed with the
use of tetraethylammonium (TEA) (entry 13). It can be seen that this
result has provided a possibility that the effects of various metal
salts and ligands on the regioselective protection can be extensively
investigated. In the first instance, a short preliminary of other
ligands using dibm, dipivaloylmethane, and diisopropylmalonate, did
not allow to identify better ones than Hacac, except dibenzoylmethane.
In addition, our attempts to use AlCl3, ZnCl2, CuSO4, or SnCl4 as the catalyst instead of
FeCl3 failed.

The scope
of this method was further evaluated using other glycosides
containing a cis-diol moiety and 1,2- and 1,3-diols
(Table 2). Hacac was
chosen as the ligand because Hacac is a cheaper reagent than Hdbm.
Then Hacac (0.31 equiv), FeCl3 (0.1 equiv), DIPEA (1.9
equiv), and the substrates were simply mixed in acetonitrile and then
BzCl (1.5 equiv) was added. The reactions were allowed to proceed
at room temperature for 4–12 h. All tested glycoside cis-diols were selectively benzoylated at the equatorial
hydroxyl groups. The obtained yields were similar to or slightly lower
than the reaction using Fe(acac)3 as the catalyst in most
cases (66–89%). The benzoylation of the galacto-type compounds 3 and 7 with TEA instead of DIPEA resulted in
poor selectivity or low conversion, indicating the uniqueness of DIPEA
for the reaction. Unexpected result was for the benzoylation of 6-O-TBS-β-thioglycoside 19, where a moderate
66% yield of 20 was obtained; whereas 93% yield of 19 was obtained when Fe(acac)3 was used as the
catalyst. Acyl group migration often occurred under basic conditions
in carbohydrate chemistry.11 Accordingly,
we suspected that the poor selectivities in the reaction originated
from acyl group migrations because of the excess amounts of DIPEA.
As a result, benzoylation of 4,6-benzylidene mannoside 25 led to 70% yield of 3-benzoated product 26a and 25%
yield of 2-benzoated product 26b where the benzoyl group
migrated to 2-position from 3-position. The benzoylation of the free
methyl glycosides 31, 33, and 35 with 1.9 equiv of DIPEA and 1.5 equiv of BzCl led to mixtures of
3-OBz, 6-OBz, and 3,6-di-OBz products. Therefore, 4.6 equiv of DIPEA
and 4 equiv of BzCl were allowed to react with 31, 33, and 35 in the presence of 0.1 equiv of FeCl3 and 0.31 equiv of acetylacetone, which produced moderate
yields of 3,6-di-OBz products 32, 34, and 36 (71–79%). Benzoylation of the 1,2- and 1,3-diols 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, and 49 using this method
led to products where the primary hydroxyl groups were selectively
benzyolated in high yields (78–88%).

As described
above that FeCl3 with the assistance of
acetylacetone have shown catalytic activity similar to or slightly
lower than Fe(acac)3 in the regioselective benzoylation.
Therefore, the method was further evaluated by performing regioselective
acetylation with AcCl as the acylation reagent. However, our attempts
failed unexpectedly. The study on the specific reason why it is infeasible
still proceeds.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
confirmed that FeCl3 can be used
as a catalyst in the regioselective benzoylation with the assistance
of acetylacetone. FeCl3 may initially form [Fe(acac)3] (acac = acetylacetonate) with acetylacetone in the presence
of DIPEA and then the formed Fe(acac)3 catalyzed the benzoylation.
Compared to the reaction using Fe(acac)3 as a catalyst,
similar or slightly lower selectivities and isolated yields were obtained
in the benzoylation in most cases. However, the attempt using this
method in acetylation failed, indicating a far more complicated catalytic
process than hypothesis. FeCl3 is a very common and inexpensive
nontoxic reagent in the lab. Therefore, the method presented here
is a green and convenient selective benzoylation method associated
with the most inexpensive catalyst. More importantly, the result provides
the possibility that the effects of various metal salts and ligands
on the regioselective protection can be extensively investigated in
future study to obtain the optimized catalytic system. The catalytic
mechanism may be further explored by using the NMR study once the
nonferrous metal salts are optimized instead of the iron catalyst.
We have initially tested four metal salts (AlCl3, ZnCl2, CuSO4, and SnCl4) and four ligands
(Hdibm, Hdpm, Hdipm, and Hdbm) in the study. Further studies are still
proceeding.

Experimental Section
General Methods
All chemicals were
purchased as reagent
grade and used without further purification. The solvents were purified
before use. CH3CN was distilled over CaH2. Chemical
reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography using precoated
silica gel 60 (0.25 mm thickness) plates. Flash column chromatography
was performed on silica gel 60 (SDS 0.040–0.063 mm). Spots
were visualized by UV light (254 nm) and charred with a solution of
H2SO4 in ethanol. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K in CDCl3 or
CD3OD using the residual signals from CDCl3 (1H: δ = 7.26 ppm) and CD3OD (1H:
δ = 3.31 ppm) as internal standard.

General Procedure for the
Monoacylation of Glycosides and Spectral
Date
The solution of N,N-DIPEA (0.19 mmol or 0.46 mmol), acetylacetone (0.031 mmol), FeCl3 (0.01 mmol) in dry acetonitrile (0.5 mL) was stirred at room
temperature for 10 min, then the substrate (0.1 mmol) was added to
the mixture, followed by the addition of BzCl (0.15 mmol or 0.40 mmol)
and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4–12 h.
The reaction mixture was directly purified by flash column chromatography,
affording the pure selectively protected derivatives.
