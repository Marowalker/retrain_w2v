The solubility of gaseous carbon
dioxide in a variety of solvents
has been extensively studied, the solute interacting with most solvents
via dispersion forces. Hence, its Hildebrand solubility parameter,
δH, may be used to predict its dissolution in liquids.
The usual definition of δH involves ΔvH, the molar enthalpy of vaporization, strictly
applicable to liquids. This expression is inapplicable for carbon
dioxide, being a gas at the temperatures of technical interest (298
≤ T/K ≤ 333), and various indirect
methods have been employed for the determination of δH(CO2,T). The appreciable polarizability
of CO2 and its ability to accept hydrogen bonds from suitable
donor solvents prompted the determination of its Hansen solubility
parameters. Finally, supercritical carbon dioxide has been extensively
used as a solvent so that its δH(scCO2,T,P) is a useful quantity to know.
The large discrepancies between the reported quantities for δH(CO2,T) are analyzed and discussed.

Introduction
Carbon dioxide is a major hothouse gas,
and its concentration in
the atmosphere has increased manifold in the last century. It is produced
naturally by volcanic eruptions, but its major source is human-made,
by the burning of fossil fuels. It may eventually essentially disappear
from the atmosphere by dissolution in the oceans and by precipitating
there as calcite because of the calcium ion content of the ocean water.
However, this is a very slow process and will not reach equilibrium
values in millennia to come. Therefore, efforts are made to capture
carbon dioxide from flue gases and concentrate it for appropriate
storage in a manner that will not permit its return to the atmosphere.1

One method that is currently in use for
achieving this goal is
the capture of carbon dioxide in aqueous solutions of ethanolamine,2 but its economics are unsatisfactory. Hence,
other solvents are sought for the purpose of capturing and storing
carbon dioxide economically, with the emphasis being placed on the
so-called “green” solvents, for example, room-temperature
ionic liquids3 and deep eutectic solvents.3,4 These solvents should be environmentally friendly, biodegradable,
and nonhazardous. Therefore, the solubility of gaseous carbon dioxide
in a variety of solvents has been extensively studied as a function
of temperature and, in some cases, also pressure.

Carbon dioxide
is a nonpolar but polarizable gas, and its interactions
with most solvents are via dispersion forces. The Hildebrand solubility
theory has therefore been applied to its dissolution in liquids. The
application of this theory requires the knowledge of the Hildebrand
solubility parameter, δH, of the solute (CO2) and that of the prospective liquid solvent. Whereas the δH values of the solvents are generally well-known or readily
ascertained, the δH value of CO2 appears
to have considerable uncertainty, as discussed in the present paper.
This quantity is generally defined as 1  where
ΔvH is the molar enthalpy of vaporization
and V is
the molar volume at the temperature T, strictly applicable
to liquids (i.e., the solvents in which carbon dioxide is to dissolve).
However, this expression is inapplicable for the determination of
the solubility parameter of carbon dioxide, being a gas at the temperatures
of interest (298 ≤ T/K ≤ 333). Various
indirect methods have had to be employed for the determination of
δH(CO2,T), and these
are discussed in this paper.

The critical point of carbon dioxide
is at the temperature Tc = 304.1 K and
pressure Pc = 7.19 MPa, which is convenient
for the use of supercritical
carbon dioxide (scCO2) as a solvent for the extraction
of desired solutes from liquid or solid substrates or in liquid chromatography.
The ability of scCO2 to do this has, again, been described
in terms of its solubility parameter, δH(CO2,T > Tc,P > Pc). Its determination is also
discussed
in this paper.

Finally, although carbon dioxide is nonpolar,
its appreciable polarizability
and ability to accept hydrogen bonds from suitable donor solvents
prompted the determination of its Hansen solubility parameters that
deal with its interactions beyond those due to the dispersion forces.
Their relationship to the total (Hildebrand) solubility parameter
is 2  where
δd is the parameter
due to the dispersion forces alone, δp is due to
the dipole(induced)dipole interactions, and δhb is
due to the hydrogen bonding. The estimation of these parameters is
also dealt with in this paper.

It turns out that there are large
discrepancies between the values
of δH reported for a given temperature and pressure
by diverse authors. These discrepancies lead to an uncertainty as
to which value to use in new situations, where the solubility of carbon
dioxide in liquid solvents or of solutes in scCO2 is to
be estimated. This paper should provide definite answers to this problem.

Solubility
Parameters of Gaseous Carbon Dioxide
Gjaldbæck5 appears to be the first
to calculate the solubility parameter for carbon dioxide gas for the
estimation of its solubility in a variety of solvents. He modified eq 1 by using pΔV instead of R, where p is the saturated vapor pressure and ΔV is the difference in the molar volumes of the gas and liquid states
of carbon dioxide. These values as well as ΔvH were taken from the Quinn and Jones compilation.6 He reported δH/MPa1/2 (converted from (cal cm–3)1/2 values)
ranging from 18.6 at T = 223 K to 5.6 at T = 303 K, just below the critical point, following a cubic
polynomial of the temperature. At T = 298.15 K the
value is δH/MPa1/2 = 8.45. However, in
the caption of a subsequent table in his paper, Gjaldbæck5 placed the value δH/MPa1/2 = 10.43 (converted as above) at T = 298.15
K for no apparent reason.

Prausnitz and Shair7 reported the value
δH/MPa1/2 = 12.27 for 298.15 K (converted
as above), based in part on the data of Gjaldbæck5 and also on those of Williams.8 This value, 12.3, was subsequently quoted and employed by LaPack
et al.9 for the calculation of the membrane
permselectivity of carbon dioxide. King et al.10 calculated the Hildebrand solubility parameter from the
internal energies reported by Din,11 the
quantity Umo – Um replacing
ΔvH – RT of eq 1, to yield δH/MPa1/2 = 11.67 (converted as above) at T = 298.15 K. Lawson12 reported
the value δH/MPa1/2 = 6.77 (converted
as above) at 298.15 K in a table along with values for other gases,
without reference to its source. Sebastian et al.13 arbitrarily chose the value (converted as above) of δH/MPa1/2 = 6.14 for carbon dioxide at T ≥ 340 K to fit with its solubility in hydrocarbons.

Camper et al.14 reported the following
expression for the solubility parameter of gaseous carbon dioxide: 3  traced to Prausnitz et al.15 and eventually to Barton,16 from
which the values δH/MPa1/2 = 12.31 at T = 298.15 K and δH/MPa1/2 =
11.51 at T = 313.15 K result. The latter value, 11.51
at T = 313.15 K, was confirmed in a subsequent paper
by Camper et al.17 This particular temperature
was relevant to the capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Kilaru et al.18 reported a slightly different
value of δH/MPa1/2 = 12.1 for this temperature, T = 313.15 K, as resulted from eq 3 that they quoted, with no reason for the
discrepancy. Moganty and Baltus19 also
used eq 3 and calculated
from it, correctly, δH/MPa1/2 = 12.3 at T = 298.15 K and δH/MPa1/2 =
11.5 at T = 313.15 K.

A value of the solubility
parameter of carbon dioxide at 298.15
K and 0.1 MPa that is much larger than that obtainable from eq 3, namely, δH/MPa1/2 = 17.4, resulted from the evaluation of the Hansen
solubility parameters (cf. eq 2),20 of which due to the dispersion
forces alone was δd/MPa1/2 = 15.6, according
to Williams et al.21 A slightly different
value, δH/MPa1/2 = 17.85, was reported
by Sistla et al.22 on the same basis, with
δd/MPa1/2 = 15.7.

Indirect values
for the solubility parameter of carbon dioxide
have been obtained by the application of the nonrandom two-liquid
model to its solutions in a variety of solvents, both polar and nonpolar,
by Vetere.23 He reported the absolute differences
between the solubility parameters of carbon dioxide and those of benzene,
toluene, methyl acetate, and methanol at T = 313.15
K (311.3 for toluene) calculated from this model as ΔδH/MPa1/2 = 3.97, 3.87, 3.49, and 9.11, respectively.
The values of δH(solvent)/MPa1/2 for these
liquid solvents are 18.5, 17.9, 18.8, and 28.6 (from ΔvH(T) and d(T) data by Riddick et al.24).
The mean value resulted for carbon dioxide is δH(CO2) = δH(solvent) ± ΔδH, that is, the upper value 21.5 ± 1.2 or the lower value
14.3, which is incompatible with the data for methanol. This, indeed,
is an unreasonably large value for this temperature, even if the data
for methanol are excluded.

The results of the solubility parameters
of carbon dioxide as a
solute from these studies are summarized for ambient pressure and
two temperatures 298.15 and 313.13 K in Table 1, which shows clearly the diversity of the
reported values.

Solubility Parameters
of scCO2
The solubility parameters of scCO2 as a solvent have
been estimated by several authors, the earliest report being that
of Allada.25 The internal energy differences Umo – Um are employed instead of
ΔvH – RT of eq 1 because ΔvH is meaningless for a supercritical fluid.
The critical constants for carbon dioxide are the temperature Tc = 304.1 K, the pressure Pc = 7.19 MPa, and the compressibility factor Zc = PcVc/RTc = 0.274.25 The required Umo – Um and Z (yielding V values) data
for scCO2 were taken from Hougen et al.26 yielding curves of δH(T) for temperatures varying from 290 to 490 K and discrete values
of pressure, Pc ≤ P ≤ 220 MPa. Being obtained from a small-scale figure and converted
to the appropriate units, the values for two temperatures relevant
to the use of scCO2 as a solvent, 313 and 333 K, are δH/MPa1/2 = 6.1 and 3.7 at P = 8.1
MPa, δH/MPa1/2 = 12.9 and 8.8 at P = 14.7 MPa, and δH/MPa1/2 =
14.3 and 12.9 at P = 29.5 MPa, respectively.

Mishra et al.27 used the expression
suggested by Giddings et al.,28 according
to which, after conversion to the appropriate units, 4  where ρr is the
reduced density
of the fluid, ρ/ρc. The first equality here
pertains to any supercritical fluid, and the second pertains to scCO2, with the appropriate value of Pc. On taking the density data for pure carbon dioxide from Pensado
et al.29 for the thermodynamic states shown
in the previous paragraph and using eq 4 values of δH/MPa1/2 larger
than those read from Allada’s figure25 result, namely, at 313.15 and 333.15 K, 9.5 and 5.5 at P = 8.1 MPa, 13.4 and 10.4 at P = 14.7 MPa, and 15.7
and 15.0 at 29.5 MPa.

Ougiyanagi et al.30 used the expression
(4) of Giddings et al.28 to calculate δH(scCO2,P)/MPa1/2 at T = 318.15 K with the values shown in Table 2. Zhang et al.31 used molecular dynamics simulations to calculate such values but
obtained lower values at pressures ≥20 MPa, also shown in this
table. Bogdanovic et al.32 reported the
values of δH(scCO2,P,T) at five pressures in the range of 16.6 ≤ P/MPa ≤33.4 and temperatures in the range of 303.15 ≤ T/K ≤ 323.15 from the Giddings et al. expression
(4), and the values at T = 319.15 K are shown in Table 2 along with those
at 318.15 K.

A single value of the solubility parameter of scCO2 was
reported by Wai and Wang33 without disclosing
its source: δH/MPa1/2 = 13.5 at T = 333.15 K and P = 22.7 MPa. Cipollina
et al.34 also specified this temperature, T = 333 K, but reported only the range of pressures 7 ≤ P/MPa ≤ 40 at which 2.7 ≤ δH/MPa1/2 ≤ 12.6, values that are rather lower than
those given by other authors. The most recent and definite equation
of state of Span and Wagner35 for carbon
dioxide yielded numerical data of the specific internal energies and
densities for supercritical conditions. The solubility parameters
calculated from these data for 7 and 20 MPa pressures for two temperatures
313.155 and 333.13 K and values reported by other authors at several
pressures, relevant to the technical use of scCO2, are
shown in Table 2, which
shows clearly the diversity of the reported values.

Hansen Solubility
Parameters of Carbon Dioxide
The Hansen solubility parameters
of carbon dioxide have been dealt
with extensively by Williams36 both at
298.15 K (his Tref) and 1 atm (0.101325
MPa) and at other temperatures and pressures, for which the reference
volume, Vref = 39.13 cm3 mol–1, is required. The values at 298.15 K and 1 atm (the
reference values, see below) are δd/MPa1/2 = 15.6 for the dispersion contribution, δp/MPa1/2 = 5.2 for the polar contribution, and δhb/MPa1/2 = 5.8 for the hydrogen-bonding contribution. The
resulting total (Hildebrand) solubility parameter is δH/MPa1/2 = 17.44 according to eq 2. For no clear reason, Sistla et al.22 referred to the same source but reported slightly
different values: δd/MPa1/2 = 15.7, δp/MPa1/2 = 6.3, and δhb/MPa1/2 = 5.7 and δH/MPa1/2 = 17.85
(the main difference being in the polar term).

Williams36 also showed that values of
the Hansen solubility parameters at other temperatures and pressures
can be calculated from the following expressions: 5   6   7  

Hence, the key value for obtaining
the Hansen solubility parameters
at other than the reference conditions is the molar volume of the
substance at the desired thermodynamic states, and these should be
available via the appropriate equation of state. Thus, at T = 298.15 K and P = 20 MPa, δd/MPa1/2 = 12.2, δp/MPa1/2 = 4.7, and δhb/MPa1/2 = 5.2 and δH/MPa1/2 = 14.0, considerably lower than those at
ambient pressure (the reference values).35 For supercritical conditions, Williams et al.21 showed small-scale three-dimensional plots of the total
(Hildebrand) and the three Hansen solubility parameters of carbon
dioxide at temperatures up to 423 K and pressures up to 60 MPa using
the semiempirical Huang 27-coefficient equation of state37 to obtain the molar volumes V of eqs 5–7.

Discussion
The purpose of obtaining
the solubility parameter of carbon dioxide
is for the prediction of solubilities of this substance as a gaseous
solute or as a solvent in its supercritical fluid state. The solubility
parameters of the solvents for gaseous CO2 and of the solutes
for scCO2 are taken as known.16 The regular solution theory is then applied in the following form,
the so-called “extended Hildebrand solubility expression”,
where subscript u is used for the solute and subscript v is used for
the solvent: 8  

In this
expression, xu is the mole
fraction of the solute in the saturated solution and xuid is the
“ideal” solubility, defined below, and the terms behind
the solubility parameter term have to be used if there are large discrepancies
between the molar volumes of the solute and the solvent. For solid
solutes, 9  where ΔfH is the
molar enthalpy
of fusion at the temperature of fusion Tf. For carbon dioxide, the value of log xuid at T = 298.15 K is −1.4209.16Equation 8 has been used for
the indirect estimation of δHu for gaseous carbon
dioxide from its solubility in a variety of solvents;
for example,23 a more sophisticated approach,
pertaining to polar solutes or solvents, for which the regular solution
theory is not supposed to be applicable, is to use the Hansen solubility
parameters and the so-called “solubility sphere”: 10  

“Good solvents”
are those for which the solubility
is larger than the ideal, “bad solvents” are those where
the opposite occurs, and the criterion is Ra <
4.0. This approach was used by Williams36 for the estimation of the Hansen and
total solubility parameters of carbon dioxide from its solubility
in 101 solvents at 298.15 K and 0.101325 MPa, only 10 of which were
deemed to be good solvents.

Although the temperature dependence
of the solubility parameter
of carbon dioxide eq 3 was referenced to Prausnitz15 and eventually
to Barton,16 this appears to be incorrect.
Although Barton reported the expression δH/MPa1/2 = m(T/K) + b, no values for m and b were reported
for carbon dioxide, but only those for hydrocarbons were reported.

The most recent and definite equation of state of Span and Wagner35 for carbon dioxide yielded numerical data reported
by them of the specific enthalpies and densities of the condensed
and gaseous states at saturation in the temperature range 218 ≤ T/K ≤ 304, where 216.59 K is the triple point and
304 K is just below the critical point. These can be described by
the quadratic expression for the Hildebrand solubility parameter according
to eq 1:38 11  and yielded an accurate
value of δH/MPa1/2 = 9.35 at 298.15 K,
shown in Table 1. This
value is in between those
reported by Gjaldbæck,5 being smaller
than those near 12 reported by Prausnitz,7 King,10 and Camper,14 considerably larger than those reported by Lawson12 and Sebastian13 near
6, and much smaller than the values reported by Williams21 and Sistla22 near
17. The difficulty arises from the fact that carbon dioxide at ambient
conditions is a gas, and it sublimes from the solid to the gaseous
state at ambient pressures without passing through a liquid state.
Therefore, the quantity ΔvH in eq 1 cannot be readily evaluated
nor can the solubility parameter unless a reliable equation of state
is available, as provided by the reference data and the numerical
data of Span and Wagner.35 Estimates of
δH/MPa1/2 at 298.15 K near 6 and 12 arise
from the inadequate data in older equations of state for carbon dioxide.
Estimates of δH/MPa1/2 at 298.15 K near
17 arise from a trial and error evaluation of the Hansen solubility
parameters14,22 from the measured solubility,
application of eq 2,
and an arbitrary criterion for distinction between good and bad solvents.
