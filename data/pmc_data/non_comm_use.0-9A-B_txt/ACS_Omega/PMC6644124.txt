In this work, the
degradation of tetracycline (TC) in water by
the integrated ultrasound (US)-Fenton process was investigated. For
this, a new composite Fe/N–C-x (x is the molar ratio of iron salt Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) catalyst was synthesized through simple carbonization of
the mixture of glucose and iron salt Fe(NO3)3·9H2O in the presence of ammonium chloride as the
nitrogen source. The resultant catalysts were characterized by X-ray
diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
vibrating sample magnetometer, and N2 adsorption–desorption,
showing a typical graphite porous structure and good magnetic properties.
The results indicated that the optimized Fe/N–C-2 catalyst
prepared with a mole ratio of glucose/Fe(NO3)3·9H2O/NH4Cl of 5:2:16.8 exhibited the
highest TC removal in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/US system at a wide pH range from 3.0 to 11.0. At an initial pH
of 7.0, TC removal in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/TC/US system was 1.83, 18.69, and 28.75 times of that in Fe/N–C-2/TC/H2O2, H2O2/TC/US, and TC/H2O2 systems, showing a positive synergistic action
between US and Fe/N–C-2. The effects of catalyst dosage, H2O2 concentration, ultrasonic power, humic acid,
and coexisting anions on TC removal were investigated. The preliminary
analysis suggested that the Fe–N species and the graphite N
dispersed in the carbon matrix are responsible for the efficient catalytic
activity. By a simple magnetic separation, the Fe/N–C-2 catalyst
was easily recovered and used for the next degradation experiment.
Above 88% catalytic ability of Fe/N–C-2 was retained even after
six successive runs, suggesting its good reusability. The simple preparation
strategy, good magnetic property, and good catalytic ability of the
Fe/N–C-2 materials make them promising alternative Fenton-like
catalysts for the antibiotics abatement in water.

1 Introduction
Antibiotics
have received wide attention because of their abuse
and potential hazards to human health and environment. As one of the
widely used antibiotics in poultry and aquaculture, tetracycline (TC)
is frequently detected in the environment.1 Because of its low bioavailability, a majority of TC antibiotics
cannot be metabolized and degraded in living organisms and are excreted
in the form of original drugs in feces and urine2 and discharged into the wastewater treatment plant or receiving
water. In addition, TC is a water-soluble antibiotic with high aqueous
solubility. This leads to its environmental mobility and its long
persistence in environment.3,4 Therefore, it is significant
to treat this kind of antibiotic in wastewater. Until now, different
techniques have been proposed to remove various pollutants.5−15 For TC removal, biological treatments,7,8 electrochemical
treatments,9 adsorption,10−14 membrane processes,13,14 and advanced
oxidation technologies8,9,12,15 have been developed. Among these methods,
the advanced oxidation processes are supposed to be a promising wastewater
treatment technology.8,9,12,16−19 In particular, as an important
advanced oxidation technology, Fenton or Fenton-like oxidation processes
have been widely used in treatment of antibiotics wastewater.9,17 Among various Fenton catalysts, iron-containing catalysts including
Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs), Fe2O3, Fe0, FeOOH, and platform(e.g., polymer, activated
carbon, zeolite, clay, carbon nanotubes, etc.)-incorporated iron materials20 have received great interest because of their
abundant reserves, rich redox properties, low cost, and nontoxicity.
However, some shortcomings have been reported, such as the instability
and insufficient H2O2 activation efficiency
of Fenton-like catalysts,21 contributing
to the iron ion-containing effluent and poor degradation performance.
Hence, developing new Fenton-like catalytic materials with high catalytic
ability and excellent stability for degradation of TC antibiotics
is critically needed.

On the other hand, previous studies have
indicated that, in the
Fenton-like process of using the heterogeneous iron-containing catalyst,
mass transfer is a limiting factor for efficient removal of pollutants22 because the heterogeneous iron-containing catalysts
were in a solid format. Ultrasound (US) can solve this problem because
of its cavitation effect and mechanical shearing action.23

In this work, to overcome the abovementioned
defects of Fenton-like
catalysts, we reported a facile strategy to synthesize the Fe/N–C-x (x is the molar ratio of iron salt precursor
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and set to 0.5,
1, 2, 3, and 5.) hybrids as heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts to
remove TC by integrated US-Fenton process. To this end, a mixture
of glucose and iron salt precursor Fe(NO3)3·9H2O in the presence of ammonium chloride (as a nitrogen source)
was carbonized, and the obtained products were characterized by a
series of analytical techniques, including N2 adsorption–desorption,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). The effects of the iron salt precursor content and
carbonization temperature on the catalytic activity of the as-prepared
products were explored. Also, effects of the solution pH, catalyst
dosage, H2O2 concentration, ultrasonic power,
humic acid (HA), and coexisting anions on TC removal were studied.
The result suggests that the optimized catalyst Fe/N–C-2 hybrids
could be used for efficient removal of TC antibiotics over a wide
pH range. Impressively, the Fe/N–C-2 hybrids exhibit good reusability
and stability.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of As-Prepared Fe/N–C-x
The Fe/N–C-x (x = 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5) catalysts were prepared by simple
carbonization of the mixture of glucose and iron salt Fe(NO3)3·9H2O in coexistence with ammonium chloride
as the nitrogen source. The XRD patterns indicated that, when x value was set to 0.5, 1, and 2, the obtained Fe/N–C-x hybrids had a broad diffraction peak at 26° (Figure 1a), corresponding
to (002) diffraction of graphitic carbon.24 The distinct peaks at 43.2° and 44.7° were assigned to
the (121) plane of Fe3C (cementite, JCPDS no. 85-0871)
and the (110) plane of metallic Fe (JCPDS no. 87-0722), respectively.
Some of the concomitant peaks in the hybrids were not observed because
of the high content of carbon (∼85%). With the increase of
the molar ratio of iron salt from 2 to 5, graphitic carbon and metallic
Fe peaks disappeared, and the obtained samples show gradually strong
characteristic peaks for iron oxides, such as the peaks at 30.2°,
35.5°, 41.7°, 56.9°, 62.6°, and so on (PDF#75-1609).
These results confirm that graphitic carbon, metallic Fe, Fe3C, and iron oxides coexist in Fe/N–C-x hybrids,
and the ratio of iron salt in precursors is a critical factor determining
the existing form of Fe in the obtained hybrids. In addition, Raman
spectra (Figure 1b)
show that the ID/IG values for the Fe/N–C-0.5, Fe/N–C-1, Fe/N–C-2,
Fe/N–C-3, and Fe/N–C-5 are 1.26, 1.05, 0.99, 1.05, and
1.18, respectively. The result indicates that the degree of the graphitization
varies with the content of used iron salt, and Fe/N–C-2 is
more graphitized than the other catalysts. The FT-IR spectra for Fe/N–C-x (x = 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5) in Figure S1 indicate that the characteristic peak
at 3435 cm–1 corresponds to −OH. The bands
at 2852 and 2922 cm–1 are corresponding to the asymmetric
and symmetric CH2 stretch.25,26 The C=C
peaks at 1618 cm–1 correspond to graphite. The characteristic
bands at 1457 cm–1 appeared to be stretch vibration
of −COO–, and the peak at 1098 cm–1 exhibited the deformation of the C–O band.27 With the increase of the metal ratio, the band at 578 cm–1 became clearer, which confirmed the existence of
metal oxides.

To investigate the influence of
the Fe content on the catalytic
activities of catalysts, we varied the Fe content at five levels to
synthesize Fe/N–C-x (x =
0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5). The results demonstrated that the catalytic
ability of the Fe/N–C-x products exhibited
a sharp rise with increase of the molar ratio of Fe from 0.5 to 2
and then declined at a molar ratio of Fe from 2 to 5 (Figure S2, Supporting Information). In the subsequent work,
the molar ratio of Fe is set at 2. In order to further understand
the high activity of the F/N–C-2 hybrid, its surface composition
was investigated by XPS. From the full survey scan (Figure S3, Supporting Information), Fe, N, and O atoms were
evidenced to be favorably introduced into the carbon matrix at a carbonization
temperature of 900 °C. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe
2p (Figure 1c) can
be deconvoluted into several peaks, including the Fe 2p3/2 (peaks at 711.0 and 714.3 eV) and Fe 2p1/2 band (peaks
at 723.7 and 725.6 eV) with a satellite peak at 719.2 eV.28 The binding energy of 711.0 eV (Fe 2p3/2) is assigned to the N-coordinated metals, demonstrating the existence
of Fe–Nx bonding.29 This suggests that Fe–Nx is formed at a high carbonization temperature of 900 °C. The
Fe–Nx formation is attributed to
the reduction of iron compounds to metal iron atoms/nanoparticles,
which subsequently react with abundant nitrogen to generate Fe–Nx.30 The formed
Fe–Nx is responsible for the high
catalytic activity of the as-obtained product. The N 1s spectra of
Fe/N–C-2 could be deconvoluted into three peaks located at
399.3, 400.3, and 402.5 eV (Figure 1d), corresponding to Fe–Nx, graphitic-N, and oxidized-N,31 respectively. The result indicates successful N doping by using
NH4Cl as the nitrogen source. This is probably because
during the process of high-temperature pyrolysis, decomposition of
NH4Cl produces NH3 gas, which disperses into
the glucose-derived porous carbon matrix to react with oxygen functionalities.32 Thus, nitrogen was doped into glucose-derived
porous carbon, resulting in formation of Fe/C–N hybrids. Similar
strategies with NH4Cl as N doping sources have also been
reported in previous works for the preparation of N-doped carbon materials.32,33 The O 1s XPS spectrum of Fe/N–C-2 could be fitted into three
peaks at binding energies of 530.3, 532.1, and 533.5 eV (Figure S4a, Supporting Information), which are assigned to
Fe–O in Fe3O4,34 C=O, and C–O,35 respectively.
The C 1s spectrum of Fe/N–C-2 is fitted into four peaks at
binding energies of 284.6, 285.1, 286.1, and 289.1 eV (Figure S4b, Supporting Information), corresponding to C=C,
C=N, C–O and C–N, and O–C=O bond,
respectively.36

The morphology of
resultant Fe/N–C-2 was investigated by
SEM and TEM. The SEM picture indicates that Fe/N–C-2 exhibits
a nanosheet pile structure (Figure 2a). The TEM picture (Figure 2b) suggests the efficient formation of the
interconnected porous nanostructure with irregular sheet-like and
hollow morphologies. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 2c) exhibited a clear
lattice spacing of 0.34 nm, which was in line with the (002) plane
of graphite. In addition, a lattice spacing of 0.24 and 0.48 nm was
confirmed to be Fe3C35 and metal
iron oxides, respectively. Moreover, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) result (Figure S5, Supporting Information) further confirms the existence of C, O, N, and Fe. N2 adsorption–desorption was used to characterize the porous
structure of Fe/N–C-2. As shown in Figure 2d, Fe/N–C-2 exhibits the type IV isotherm,
and the hysteresis loop implies the existence of mesoporous structures.
Based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method, the surface
area, pore diameter, and pore volume of Fe/N–C-2 are 141.97
m2/g, 78.1 nm, and 0.278 cm3/g, respectively.
The magnetic property study suggests that the saturation magnetization
value of Fe/N–C-2 is 62 emu/g (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Such a good magnetic property implies
that Fe/N–C-2 can be easily recovered from water media with
a magnetic force. This is critical for the promising use of Fe/N–C-2
in the removal of antibiotics in water.

2.2 TC Removal in Different Systems
The
TC removal performance under different systems was evaluated at conditions
of 60 mM H2O2 and 100 mg/L TC solution (25 mL,
pH 7.0). Figure 3a
shows the time dependence of TC removal by H2O2 in the absence and presence of 0.2 g/L Fe/N–C-2 and 80 W
US power. As can be seen, at an initial pH of 7.0 and 80 min of reaction
time, TC removal in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/TC/US system was 1.83, 18.69, and 28.75 times of that in the Fe/N–C-2/TC/H2O2, H2O2/TC/US, and TC/H2O2 systems, respectively. Specifically, in the
TC/H2O2 system, minor TC was removed (3.2%)
when H2O2 was applied to the TC solution alone,
indicating that the direct oxidation of TC by H2O2 is negligible. When US was introduced into the H2O2/TC system, TC removal increased to 4.96%, suggesting that
the cavitation bubbles could slightly accelerate TC removal. However,
in the TC/H2O2/Fe/N–C-2 system, 50.6%
of TC removal was reached, which was 15.81 times of that in the TC/H2O2 system. The result suggests a key role of Fe/N–C-2
in TC sequestration. This is probably due to H2O2 activation by Fe/N–C-2 to produce the•OH
radical (see later discussion). Impressively, further introduction
of US into the TC/H2O2/Fe/N–C-2 system
results in 92.77% of TC removal, clearly showing a positive synergistic
effect between US and Fe/N–C-2 in the TC/H2O2/Fe/N–C-2 system.34 This
is because the solid surface of Fe/N–C-2 could provide extra
nucleation sites for cavitation creation, and thus the cavitation
activity was improved because of the increased number of cavitation
bubbles, which promoted the generation of hydroxyl radicals and finally
led to the enhanced TC degradation.37 Additionally,
US irradiation could remove the chemicals which are refractory to •OH23 and clean the surface
of the Fe/N–C-2 catalyst for further surface reaction15 to produce •OH species, further
improving TC degradation efficiency. Besides, the Fe/N–C-2
catalyst could be well dispersed in aqueous solution under US irradiation,
so that the solid–liquid contact surface was enlarged, and
the TC degradation was promoted upon the addition of Fe/N–C-2
into the US/TC/H2O2 system. Thus, the observed
synergistic effect is probably attributed to the good dispersion of
the Fe/N–C-2 catalyst in aqueous solution under US irradiation,
continuously cleaning the surface of the Fe/N–C-2 catalyst
by US treatment and improvement in the ultrasonic efficiency because
of rise in the nucleation sites for the creation of cavitation bubbles
upon the addition of Fe/N–C-2 into the US/TC/H2O2 system.

2.3 Influence
of Pyrolysis Temperature on the
Catalytic Activity of the Obtained Products for TC Removal
To investigate the influence of pyrolysis temperature on the catalytic
activity of the obtained products for TC removal, the Fe/N–C-2
catalysts were prepared at five temperatures (600, 700, 800, 900,
and 1000 °C). In detail, 2 g of glucose was well mixed with 1.9952
g of ammonium chloride and 1.7940 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O with a mole ratio of glucose/Fe(NO3)3·9H2O/NH4Cl of 5:2:16.8.
Then, the mixture was grinded in an agate mortar and transferred into
a porcelain boat, and pyrolyzed at abovementioned five temperatures
for 2 h in nitrogen flow with a heating speed of 5 °C per min.
The TC removal experiment was carried out at conditions of 5 mg of
the catalyst, 60 mM H2O2, 100 mg/L TC solution
(25 mL, pH 7.0), and 80 W ultrasonic power. As shown in Figure 3b, TC removal efficiency increased
rapidly with carbonization temperature from 600 to 900 °C. However,
when the carbonization temperature was above 900 °C, TC removal
efficiency increased very slowly. The result implies that the high
carbonization temperature is favorable to create a high activity catalyst,
which is due to the formation of the Fe–Nx structure in the resultant product.38 In this work, a carbonization temperature of 900 °C was utilized
as the final temperature for preparing the Fe/N–C-2 catalyst.

2.4 Effect of Initial Solution pH
Previous
reports indicate that the solution pH plays a critical role in the
efficiency of the Fenton/Fenton-like process. The dependence of TC
removal on initial solution pH was explored under conditions of 5
mg of the Fe/N–C-2 catalyst, 60 mM H2O2, 100 mg/L TC solution (25 mL), and 80 W ultrasonic power (Figure 3c). TC removal efficiency
changed from 93.8 to 86.3% after 80 min treatment, as the initial
solution pH changed from 3 to 11 (Figure S7, Supporting Information). It is found that above 86% removal of TC was
realized after 80 min reaction, indicating that Fe/N–C-2 could
be used for efficient removal of TC antibiotics over a wide pH range.
The removal efficiency was enhanced gradually when initial solution
pH increased from 3.0 to 5.0. This suggests that increase in solution
pH helped TC removal in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/US system. However, after reaching climax at pH 5.0, TC removal
exhibited a slight decrease at a pH range from 5.0 to 11.0. This phenomenon
can be interpreted based on variance of the species of TC and the
surface charge property of Fe/N–C-2 in the tested pH range.
TC is an amphoteric organic compound with three pKa values of 3.30, 7.68, and 9.69.39 As shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information), majority of TC presents as a positively charged state as TCH3+ at pH < 3.30, a noncharged state as TCH20 at neutral pH,
and as a negatively charged molecule as TCH– or
TC2– at pH > 7.68. Figure S9 shows the effect of the solution pH from 3 to 11 on the
zeta potential
of Fe/N–C-2. The point of zero charge for Fe/N–C-2 was
about 4.5, indicating a negative surface of Fe/N–C-2 at pH
> 4.5 and a positive surface at pH < 4.5. When solution pH changed
from 3.0 to 5.0, the TC species transform from the mixed TCH3+ and TCH20 species to main TCH20 species, whereas the surface potential of
Fe/N–C-2 declines from +6.0 to −7.4 mV. However, when
solution pH is above 5.0, the rising TCH– or TC2– species and strong negative surface of Fe/N–C-2
induce repulsive interaction between TC and the Fe/N–C-2 catalyst,
resulting in decline in TC adsorption. Thus, enhanced TC removal at
a pH range from 3.0 to 5.0 is presumably due to both the electrostatic
attractions and hydrophobic interactions between TC and Fe/N–C-2.
Importantly, generation of hydroxyl radicals from H2O2 is favorable under acidic conditions.37,40 Thus, TC removal increases because of the hydroxyl free radical
attack. However, further increase in the solution pH leads to increase
in TC anion species. This is unfavorable for TC to diffuse into reactive
zones of the Fe/N–C-2 catalyst because of its negative surface
under alkaline conditions. Hence, lower TC removal is obtained. Considering
the practical application and relatively high removal efficiency,
pH 7.0 was chosen as the optimized pH in this work.

2.5 Effect of Fe/N–C-2 Concentration
The degradation
of TC at different concentrations of Fe/N–C-2
was investigated under conditions of 60 mM H2O2, 100 mg/L TC solution (25 mL, pH 7.0), and 80 W ultrasonic power.
As depicted in Figure 3d, when the concentration of Fe/N–C-2 increased from 0.04
to 0.6 g/L, the TC removal efficiency increased from 67.9 to 96.5%.
This is probably because the number of active sites increased as the
concentration of Fe/N–C-2 increased, which accelerated the
decomposition of H2O2 to produce more •OH radicals. The formation of •OH radicals was
verified by the result of using terephthalic acid as a fluorescence
probe. As shown in Figure S10, the gradual
rise in the fluorescence response was observed when the concentration
of Fe/N–C-2 increased, indicating an increase in the amount
of the generated •OH by the catalysis of Fe/N–C-2.
Considering that above 93% TC removal efficiency was obtained at 0.2
g/L Fe/N–C-2, in the present investigation, 0.2 g/L was selected
as optimal catalyst concentration.

2.6 Effect
of H2O2 Concentration
The effect of
H2O2 concentration on TC removal
was studied under conditions of 5 mg of the Fe/N–C-2 catalyst,
100 mg/L TC solution (25 mL), and 80 W ultrasonic power. The results
are shown in Figure 3e. The result of the control experiment suggested small TC removal
of less than 4% in the absence of H2O2 (Figure 3a). Such removal
is attributed to TC adsorption by Fe/N–C-2. The introduction
of H2O2 into the Fe/N–C-2/US system obviously
increased the removal of TC. When H2O2 concentration
increased from 20 to 60 mM, TC removal showed a dramatic increase
to reach the peak of 96% after 80 min. However, a further rise in
H2O2 concentration leads to a decrease in TC
removal. This is because excessive H2O2 is the •OH radical scavenger41 which
competes for the hydroxyl radicals with TC, contributing to inhibition
of TC degradation. In this work, the optimized H2O2 concentration was set at 60 mM.

2.7 Effect
of Ultrasonic Power
Ultrasonic
power is an important factor in controlling the cavitational activity,
thus playing a significant effect on the degradation of organic pollutants.
The effect of ultrasonic power (0, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 W) on
the degradation efficiency of TC was investigated at conditions of
0.2 g/L Fe/N–C-2, 60 mM H2O2, and 100
mg/L TC solution (25 mL, pH 7.0). As shown in Figure 3f, significant increase in TC removal was
obtained when the ultrasonic power increased from 0 to 80 W. For example,
92.5% TC removal was obtained at an ultrasonic power of 80 W, whereas
only 60.6% TC degradation was observed at an ultrasonic power of 40
W after 40 min of treatment. This is because US irradiation can continuously
clean the surface of the catalyst by removing byproducts for further
reaction.15 Furthermore, with the increase
of US power, the cavitational bubble collapses to generate turbulence
and increases the mixing intensity between the catalyst and pollutant.42 However, it is also noted that further increase
in ultrasonic power results in decline in TC removal. This is mainly
because the cavitation bubble has grown to extend and then collapse
during the compression cycle of the cavitation process, leading to
a weakened cavitation effect at a high intensity of US irradiation.43 Therefore, we chose 80 W as optimized US power.

From results shown in Figure 3b–f, it can be concluded that TC removal exhibits
no significant change when the reaction time was increased from 40
to 80 min in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/TC/US
system. However, in our work, we selected 80 min as the reaction time
in each experiment. This selection was based on the result of total
organic carbon (TOC) analysis. As can be seen from Figure S11, when the reaction time was increased from 40 to
80 min in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/TC/US system,
the TOC removal efficiency increased from about 29–40%, with
above 35% enhancement in TOC removal. This suggests a significant
increase in TC mineralization. Hence, in this work, 80 min was selected.

2.8 Effect of HA
Dissolved organic matter
is ubiquitous in river water or groundwater. HA is a major component
of dissolved organic matter. Thus, in this work, the influence of
HA on TC removal in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/US system was evaluated. The result is shown in Figure S12. When HA concentration increased from 0 to 20 mg/L,
TC removal efficiency decreased from 92.2 to 89.8%. This suggests
that HA has a minor effect on the degradation of TC in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/US system. This is probably because HA can also
be degraded into smaller fractions by •OH produced
in the Fenton process.44

2.9 Effect of the Anion on TC Degradation
The effects of
coexisting anions (Cl–, NO3–, PO43–, SO42–, and HCO3–) on
TC removal in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/US degradation
system were investigated, and the results are shown in Figure 4a. It is clear that addition
of the tested anions into the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/US degradation system hindered TC removal. For example, in the absence
of anions, the TC removal efficiency reached 92.6% after 80 min reaction.
However, it decreased to 86.6, 91.6, 87.6, 91.5, and 90.0% in the
presence of PO43–, SO42–, HCO3–, Cl–, and NO3–, respectively. Similar results
were reported by other researchers.45−48 This is because anions such as
nitrate, sulfate, chloride, phosphate, and bicarbonate have been reported
to scavenge •OH to form less active ionic radicals
(such as NO3•, SO4•–, Cl•, PO4•2–, and HCO3•/CO3•–) than •OH or •O2–.45−48

SO42–, 5 mg/L NO3–, 5 mg/L HCO3–, and 20 mg/L Cl– on TC removal in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/US
system. Experimental conditions: 100 mg/L of TC solution (25 mL),
pH 7.0, 0.2 g/L of Fe/N–C-2, 60 mM of H2O2, and 80 W US power. (b) Effect of different radical scavengers on
the removal of TC. Reaction conditions: 0.2 g/L of Fe/N–C-2;
60 mM of H2O2; 80 W US power; 1 mM of PBQ, 0.05
M NaN3, 0.2 M TBA; and pH 7.0. Error bars denote 1 SD for
three measurements.

2.10 Reactive
Oxygen Species
To explore
the reactive oxygen species generated in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/US system, various radical scavengers were tested
to understand their contribution to TC degradation. As depicted in Figure 4b, in the presence
of p-benzoquinone (PBQ), 26% inhibition of TC removal
was observed, whereas tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and
NaN3 gave about 15% inhibition of TC removal after 80 min
of reaction time. These results confirm that •O2–, •OH, and 1O2 are involved in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/US system because PBQ, TBA, and NaN3 are scavengers
of the superoxide radical (•O2–),49 the hydroxyl radical (•OH),50 and singlet molecular oxygen (1O2),51 respectively.
The formation of •OH radicals was also confirmed
by the result of using terephthalic acid as a fluorescence probe (Figure
S10, Supporting Information). On the basis
of above results, we can conclude that •OH, •O2–, and 1O2 were generated in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/US system. •OH is from the decomposition
of H2O2 activated by the Fe/N–C-2 catalyst. •O2– may come from oxygen
dissolved in the solution.52 After production,
the recombination reaction of •OH and •O2– would generate 1O2.53

2.11 Recycling
Ability of Fe/N–C-2
To explore the recycling ability
of the as-prepared Fe/N–C-2
catalyst, TC removal by the recycled Fe/N–C-2 was tested, and
the result is shown in Figure 5. In the first run, 5 mg (i.e. at dose 0.2 g/L) of Fe/N–C-2
was added in 25 mL of TC solution (100 mg/L, pH 7.0) for 5–80
min reaction under optimized conditions. ∼94% TC was removed
after 80 min reaction. After the first degradation procedure, Fe/N–C-2
was recovered by a simple magnetic separation, cleaned with water,
and dried in an oven. Then, 5 mg of the recovered Fe/N–C-2
was used for the next cycle. Above 88% catalytic activity of Fe/N–C-2
was obtained after the sixth cycle, indicating that the recycled Fe/N–C-2
exhibited a good catalytic ability after six cycles (Figure 5). Furthermore, XRD patterns
of the original Fe/N–C-2 catalyst are almost the same as those
of the recycled Fe/N–C-2 catalyst (Figure S13a, Supporting Information), demonstrating their
good stability during catalytic reaction. The FT-IR spectra indicate
that the recycled Fe/N–C-2 retained specific peaks (Figure
S13b, Supporting Information), which further
confirmed the stability of Fe/N–C-2. Impressively, after the
catalytic reaction, the Fe/N–C-2 hybrids can be facilely recovered
from aqueous media by simple magnetic separation with an external
magnetic force because of the good magnetic property possessed by
the Fe/N–C-2 hybrids (Figure S6, Supporting Information).

in six
reaction cycles.

3 Conclusions
In the present work, the Fe/N–C-x hybrids
were successfully prepared by simply carbonizing the mixture of glucose
and iron salt precursor Fe(NO3)3·9H2O in the presence of ammonium chloride as the nitrogen source
and used as a heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst to remove TC. The
results demonstrated that the optimized Fe/N–C-2 hybrids, prepared
with a mole ratio of glucose/Fe(NO3)3·9H2O/NH4Cl of 5:2:16.8, were efficient materials for
TC removal in aqueous solutions. The introduction of US significantly
enhances the removal efficiency of the Fe/N–C-2 hybrids. The
effective degradation of TC in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/TC/US system was attributed to the synergistic action between
US and the Fe/N–C-2 catalyst. The Fe/N–C-2 catalyst
exhibited the highest TC removal in the Fe/N–C-2/H2O2/US system at a wide pH range from 3.0 to 11.0. The
good magnetic property makes Fe/N–C-2 facilely recovered from
water media with the help of magnetic force, leading to their easy
regeneration. Impressively, above 88% catalytic ability of Fe/N–C-2
was retained even after six successive runs, indicating high stability
of the Fe/N–C-2 hybrids in aqueous solution. The simple preparation
strategy, good magnetic property, wide pH tolerance, high catalytic
ability, and good recyclability make Fe/N–C-2 a promising alternative
Fenton-like catalyst for the antibiotics abatement in water.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemical Reagents
TC was provided
by Macklin (Shanghai, China). Glucose, ammonium chloride, and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were provided by Kelong
Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Chengdu, China). HA was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). The other chemicals, such as NaHCO3, NaCl, Na3PO4, Na2SO4, HCl, and NaOH were bought from Chongqing Taixing Chemical
Co. Ltd. (Chongqing, China). All chemicals are of at least analytical
grade and utilized with no treatment.

4.2 Apparatus
Acquisition of SEM pictures
was taken on a model 4800 field emission electron microscope (Hitachi,
Japan), which was operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The
XRD data for the synthesized catalysts were collected on a TD-3500
X-ray diffractometer (Tongda, Dandong, China), which was operated
at a current of 20 mA and a voltage of 30 kV. The scanning rate for
collecting the data was set at 4° min–1. The
TEM pictures and composition information of the synthesized catalysts
were acquired on a Tecnai G2 F20 instrument, which was operated at
an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Acquisition of FI-IR spectral data
was performed on a Tensor 27 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
(Bruker, Germany). The XPS data were collected on a type ESCALAB 250XI
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA). A Type HH-15 VSM
was utilized to obtain the saturation magnetization value of Fe/N–C-2.
TC analysis after degradation experiments was carried out on a UV-2450
spectrophotometer (Suzhou, Japan).

4.3 Synthesis
of Fe/N–C
Typically,
2 g of glucose was well mixed with 1.9952 g of ammonium chloride and
1.7940 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O with
a mole ratio of glucose/Fe(NO3)3·9H2O/NH4Cl of 5:2:16.8. Then, the mixture was grinded
in an agate mortar and transferred into a porcelain boat, and pyrolyzed
at 900 °C for 2 h in nitrogen flow in a high-temperature tube
furnace with a heating speed of 5 °C per min. To explore the
influence of the Fe content on catalytic activities of the obtained
products, we prepared the catalysts by changing the molar ratio of
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O to 0.5, 1, 2,
3, and 5, whereas the amount of glucose and NH4Cl was retained
unchanged. The obtained product was named Fe/N–C-x (x denotes the molar ratio of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O.).

4.4 Degradation
Experiment
TC abatement
trials were carried out by introducing 5 mg of Fe/N–C-x and 60 mM H2O2 into 25 mL 100 mg/L
TC solution for 5–80 min (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, and 80) ultrasonic
irradiation treatment. After reaction, the solution was filtered by
a 0.22 μm mixed fiber membrane (Tianjin Automatic Science Instrument
Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China), and the filtrate was used for TC detection.
The concentration of TC in the filtrate was determined by the spectrophotometric
method by measuring the absorbance of the solution at 356 nm. The
initial solution pH of TC solution was regulated by 0.1 M HCl or 0.1
M NaOH. All experiments were carried out repeatedly at least three
times, and the mean value data were reported.
