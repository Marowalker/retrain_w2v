Phosphatase of regenerating liver
(PRL)-3 (PTP4A3) has gained much attention in cancer
research due to its involvement
in tumor promoting and metastatic processes. It belongs to the protein
tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily and is thought to follow the
catalytic mechanism shared by this family, which aside from the conserved
active-site amino acids includes a conserved glutamic acid residue
that is usually required for the integrity of the active site in PTPs.
We noted that in structures of PRL-3, PRL-1, and PTEN these residues
do not clearly align and therefore we sought to investigate if the
glutamic acid residue fulfills its usual function in these proteins.
Although this residue was essential for PTEN’s catalytic activity,
it was nonessential for PRL-1 and PRL-3. Surprisingly, the mutation
E50R increased PRL-3 activity against all tested in vitro substrates
and also enhanced PRL-3-promoted cell adhesion and migration. We show
that the introduction of Arg50 leads to an enhancement of substrate
turnover for both PRL-3 and, to a lesser extent, PRL-1, and that the
stronger gain in activity correlates with a higher structural flexibility
of PRL-3, likely allowing for conformational adaptation during catalysis.
Thus, in contrast to its crucial functions in other PTPs, this conserved
glutamic acid can be replaced in PRL-3 without impairing the structural
integrity. The variant with enhanced activity might serve as a tool
to study PRL-3 in the future.

1 Introduction
Phosphatase
of regenerating liver (PRL)-3 belongs to the dual-specificity
phosphatases of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily.
It has attracted attention through its involvement in cancerogenesis
and metastatic events (for review, see refs (1, 2)). Still, although substrates and interaction
partners were suggested by studies in various cell lines,1−4 molecular mechanisms of PRL-3 remain a challenge to address. Efforts
to identify substrates are often hampered by insufficiently clear
readouts and seemingly cell-line-specific phenotypes.1,2

The catalytic mechanism of PTPs involves a cysteine residue
whose
thiolate attacks the scissile phosphate group in the first step of
the two-step catalytic reaction, an arginine residue for transition-state
stabilization of the phosphocysteine intermediate, and an aspartic
acid functioning as general acid/base during both steps of catalysis.
Both the cysteine and arginine are part of the conserved active-site
p-loop of PTPs, and the aspartic acid is found in the flexible WPD-loop
(Asp72 in PRL-3) that closes toward the active site for catalysis.5,6 A conserved serine/threonine residue stabilizes the thiolate before
the nucleophilic attack on the phosphoester and assists in the hydrolysis
of the phosphocysteine intermediate in the second catalytic step.5,7 Maintenance of a functional catalytic site is furthermore achieved
by a glutamic acid residue positioning the catalytic p-loop arginine
through hydrogen bonding.1,8 This conserved glutamic
acid was proposed to be part of a structural CXnE motif in PTPs containing a regulatory (“backdoor”)
cysteine,1 which regulates the enzyme’s
activity through disulfide bond formation with the active-site cysteine.9 Alignment of a recent X-ray structure of PRL-3
(pdb entry 5TSR)10 with the closely related phosphatases
PRL-1, PTEN, and PTPMT1 that contain the proposed motif suggests,
however, that the glutamic acid may not position the catalytic arginine
residue through hydrogen bonds in PRL-3, PRL-1, and PTEN given the
further distance between the residues (Figure 1a,c). This suggests that the glutamic acid
within the proposed CXnE motif could serve
different purposes in these phosphatases, which is further indicated
by the structural flexibility and variability shown in the available
NMR structures of PRL-3 (pdb entries 2MBC, 1R6H, 1V3A) (Figure 1b,c).

Figure 1 (a) Structural superposition of PTPs and the CXnE motif. The respective glutamic acids and the
catalytic
arginine residues are indicated for PRL-3 (orange: 5TSR), PRL-1 (green: 5MMZ), PTEN (magenta: 1D5R), and PTPMT1 (cyan: 3RGQ). Tight glutamate–arginine
interactions as seen with PTPMT1 seem rather questionable for PRL-3,
PRL-1, and PTEN. For PTPMT1, Glu144 from the “EEYE”
motif aligns well with the Glu of the CXnE motif of the other PTPs. (b) Superposition of an X-ray (5TSR) and various NMR
structures (others) of PRL-3 showing the protein’s flexibility

Glu50 is indicated. (c) Distances between Arg and Glu residues of
the indicated phosphatases. For 5TSR, the reported value is an average calculated
on both chains A and C; for 2MBC and 1R6H, the reported value is the average value calculated on the deposited
20 models.

Furthermore, PRL-3 shows a somewhat
different active-site architecture
from that of other PTPs. Still harboring the invariant catalytic cysteine,
aspartic acid, and arginine residues, the conserved serine/threonine
is replaced by an alanine residue in wild-type (wt) PRL-3 (Ala111).9,11 This is also the case in CDC25 and DUSP19, accompanied with inherently
low phosphatase activity.12,13 For PRL-3, it was shown
that the absence of a serine in position 111 leads to slower hydrolysis
of the phosphocysteine intermediate involving two kinetic phases,
a “burst-phase” followed by a slower steady-state phase,
which can lead to a temporal blockage of the active site.9,10 Reconstituting this serine in PRL-3 through an A111S mutation led
to the expected gain in catalytic activity against the unnatural substrates
3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP)9 and 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate
(DiFMUP), where the steady-state kinetic phase was not observed anymore.10 Nevertheless, in a previous study, we observed
less in vitro dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate
(PI(4,5)P2) by the PRL-3 A111S variant compared to wt PRL-3.
Also, PRL-3-like promotion of cell migration was lacking when overexpressing
the A111S variant,14 showing that Ala111
is not replaceable without disturbing PRL-3’s integrity and
that it appears to serve a function in the native enzyme.

In
this study, we investigated how mutations of Glu50 in PRL-3
affect its catalytic activity, in comparison to the respective Glu73
in PTEN and Glu50 in PRL-1. We found that although for PTEN the glutamic
acid is important for catalysis, it was nonessential for PRL-3’s
and PRL-1’s catalytic activities. By contrast, the PRL-3 variant
E50R led to a strong gain in PRL-3’s enzymatic activity, maintaining
the specificity pattern against phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs)
and showing enhanced activity also in cells. Thus, as opposed to the
respective conserved glutamic acid in other PTPs and to the Ala111
in PRL-3, Glu50 in PRL-3 is replaceable without disturbing PRL-3’s
structural integrity. Kinetic and stability studies revealed that
the unique flexibility of PRL-3 and ability of Arg50 to rescue the
deletion of the catalytically important Arg110 when dephosphorylating
PIPs are underlying features for the enhanced activity.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Different Roles of a Conserved
Glutamic Acid
in PRL-3 and PTEN
To investigate the role of glutamic acid
as part of the proposed CXnE motif for
PRL-3’s and PTEN’s catalytic activity, we carried out
a mutagenesis study and compared enzymatic activities to the respective
wt proteins. Mutations were selected according to loss of charge in
the case of mutation E → Q, reversion of charge from negative
to positive with mutation E → R, and replacement with a small,
hydrophobic group with mutation E → A. PTEN was monitored for
dephosphorylating its substrate PI(3,4,5)P3,15 and concomitantly, the proposed natural substrate
PI(4,5)P214 was chosen for PRL-3.
All three PTEN Glu73 variants showed a decrease or loss of activity
(Figure 2a), suggesting
an important role of this glutamic acid in PTEN’s catalytic
mechanism in agreement with the proposed structural interaction with
the catalytic arginine (see Figure 1).1 By contrast, the results
with the corresponding PRL-3 variants indicated a different mechanism.
Mutation E50A did not have any effect on the activity against PI(4,5)P2. Variants E50Q and especially E50R were significantly more
active than wt PRL-3 (Figure 2b). A similar effect of the three PRL-3 mutations was found
when comparing activities to the unnatural substrate DiFMUP, as shown
by kinetic profiles in Table 1a. Although binding (reflected by Km values) was not altered, turnover rates were increased, with PRL-3
E50R again showing the highest activity, followed by E50Q and E50A.
Introducing the mutations in PRL-3 did not significantly affect overall
protein folding (Figure 2c). When comparing the hydrolysis of PRL-3 wt and E50R with DiFMUP,
E50R accelerated both the burst and steady-state kinetics of the reaction
(Figure S1), suggesting that both the formation
of the phosphocysteine intermediate and its hydrolysis are facilitated
in PRL-3 E50R compared to the wt enzyme. Taken together, these results
suggest differences in the active-site architecture of PRL-3 and PTEN
regarding the role of the glutamic acid in maintaining a catalytically
competent active site. Although the decrease of activity of PTEN Glu73
variants suggests a similar mechanism to that seen with PTPMT1,5 PRL-3 activity was not affected by the E50A mutation
and positively modulated by mutating residue Glu50 with polar amino
acids, implying that Glu50 is nonessential for PRL-3’s catalytic
activity.

Section. The difference in Kcat/Km between PRL-3

2.2 Biochemical Characterization
of the PRL-3
E50R Variant
Given the common role of the conserved glutamic
acid to position the arginine of the p-loop, replacement of Glu50
in PRL-3 without impairing the structural integrity of the protein
would be a unique structural feature among the PTPs. To address if
this is the case and to explain the observation of enhanced activity
of PRL-3 E50R, we sought to gain insight into a potential role of
this residue in catalysis and investigated the catalytic mechanism
in detail. First, we compared PRL-3 E50R’s activity with wt
PRL-3 against the naturally occurring PIP species. PRL-3 E50R was
able to dephosphorylate all seven PIPs more efficiently than the wt
enzyme (Figure 3a,b).
The individual activity pattern against the various PIP species remained
similar for both enzymes, suggesting that mutation E50R generally
enhances activity without altering the enzyme’s specificity
and that Glu50 can be replaced without impairing the protein’s
structural integrity. In addition, the variant exhibited also increased
activity against the unnatural substrate OMFP (Figure 3c). Overall, PRL-3 E50R shows similar substrate
recognition preferences to wt PRL-3, as opposed to the previously
reported hyperactive variant A111S.14 In
addition, PRL-3 E50R was inhibited by our recently developed small-molecule
inhibitor analog 3(16) with
similar potency to wt PRL-3 (IC50 23.9 ± 0.2 vs 31.4
± 3.5 μM, respectively, using DiFMUP as substrate). This
suggests that the inhibitor does not interact with the Glu50-containing
stretch in PRL-3.

PRL-3 variant E50R. (a, b) PRL-3 variant (b) E50R dephosphorylates
all PIP species more efficiently than (a) wild-type PRL-3, with the
individual activity curves shown. (c) E50R shows increased activity
against the unnatural substrate OMFP. (d–f) PRL-3 variant E50R-R110A
reveals different roles of Arg50 for catalysis, depending on the substrate
used. In vitro activities of PRL-3 variants against (d) DiFMUP and
(e) PI(4,5)P2 are shown. Results are shown as mean ±
SD. Statistics, compared to respective wt enzyme: ***p = 0.0004; ****p = 0.0001. (f) E50R-R110A dephosphorylates
all seven PIP species with turnover values between E50R and wild-type
PRL-3. (g) PI(4,5)P2 titration profiles reveal non-Michaelis–Menten
kinetics with sigmoidal curve shapes, showing altering apparent affinity
(Kapp) and maximal turnover for the different
variants. Data are shown as mean ± SD. The following concentrations
were used: PIPs 100 μM with 6 μM enzyme; OMFP 600 μM
with 6 μM enzyme; and DiFMUP 21 μM with 50 nM enzyme.

To address the mechanistic basis
for the gain of activity of the
PRL-3 E50R variant, we hypothesized that the E50R mutation would introduce
a new arginine residue in close proximity to the active site that
could stabilize the phosphocysteine in a similar manner to the catalytic
Arg110.17,18 Also, having an additional positively charged
arginine residue in place could facilitate binding of negatively charged
phosphosubstrates or change the structure of the active site without
taking active part in transition-state stabilization. To probe these
hypotheses, we created PRL-3 variants R110A and E50R-R110A. The R
→ A variant, lacking the transition-state-stabilizing residue,
was shown for similar phosphatases to be catalytically inactive.19 The double mutant possessed only the newly introduced
Arg50 and lacked the catalytic Arg110. None of the newly introduced
mutations disrupted protein folding (Figure S2). Interestingly, although both PRL-3 R110A and E50R-R110A were completely
inactive against the unnatural substrate DiFMUP (Figure 3d), E50R-R110A was able to
hydrolyze PI(4,5)P2, whereas R110A was, as expected, also
inactive against the latter (Figure 3e). As shown in Figure 3f, PRL-3 E50R-R110A dephosphorylated all seven PIP
species with a constant efficiency pattern between wt PRL-3 and E50R,
again leaving the substrate specificity intact. Furthermore, using
isothermal titration calorimetry, we observed that the PRL-3 variant
E50R-R110A did not bind to DiFMUP anymore (Figure S3), explaining the absence of dephosphorylation activity.

To understand the influence of Arg50 on PIP catalysis in more detail,
we carried out a kinetic analysis on PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis
with the PRL-3 E50R and E50R-R110A variants. The results are shown
in Figure 3g. PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis by PRL-3 and its variants followed non-Michaelis–Menten
kinetics with sigmoidal curve shapes. The apparent affinity (Kapp, PI(4,5)P2 concentration at the
inflection point) was similar in all cases and indicated only a slightly
stronger PI(4,5)P2 binding for PRL-3 E50R-R110A than for
E50R, and for both, binding was again slightly stronger than wt PRL-3.
As shown by the maximal activity reached, PRL-3 E50R was more active
than E50R-R110A and the least-active PRL-3 wt, showing a similar advantage
for E50R in PI(4,5)P2 substrate turnover to that seen with
DiFMUP. Because the overall phosphate turnover was enhanced for all
of the PIP species when using the two PRL-3 variants (see Figure 3f), this effect of
Arg50 seems to be independent of the number of negative charges present
on the substrate. Together, these results show that for PI(4,5)P2 Arg50 is able to compensate for the catalytic Arg110, whereas
substrate recognition is lost in the case of DiFMUP, and that it assists
for both substrates in more efficient substrate turnover. To accomplish
this, the additional arginine must be placed in a feasible position
toward PI(4,5)P2, which could be enabled by the flexible
nature of the protein20 allowing for structural
rearrangements during catalysis. Furthermore, given its close proximity
to both the p- and WPD-loops in some structural conformations (Figure 1), Arg50 might assist
in the phosphocysteine hydrolysis by providing an additional hydrogen
bond similarly to the conserved serine would, which is not present
in PRL-3. Alternatively, it could interact with Asp71 or Asp72 and
place the WPD-loop in PRL-3 in a favorable position for faster accessibility
of Asp72 during catalysis, and this would lead to the accelerated
steady-state kinetics observed above.

The non-Michaelis–Menten
kinetics that we observed with
PIP hydrolysis are not a general feature of the assay format, as the
same kind of assay (EnzChek Phosphate Assay Kit) has been used in
other types of studies with classical Michaelis–Menten profiles.21 The behavior is not specific to PRL-3 because
the enzyme showed classical behavior when tested against DiFMUP (see Figure S1). Non-Michaelis–Menten behavior
is typically known for oligomerizing enzymes.22 Because PRL-3 was reported to oligomerize,23 a protein concentration effect could be the reason for possible
PRL-3 oligomerization23 as different enzyme
concentrations were used in both assay types (see Experimental Section). Additionally, a more complex picture,
including oligomerizing PIPs or the substrates inducing PRL-3 oligomerization,
cannot be ruled out.

2.3 Mutation
E50R Does Not Alter PRL-3’s
Redox Properties
Redox regulation is an important mechanism
to modulate PTP activity.24 Therefore,
we further investigated if the enhanced activity of PRL-3 E50R resulted
from altered redox properties compared to wt PRL-3. Similar to other
PTPs, such as PTEN, CDC25, or LMW-PTP,25−27 PRL-3 contains a regulatory
cysteine (Cys49) in close proximity to the active site9 that forms a reversible intramolecular disulfide bond with
the catalytic cysteine (Cys104) under oxidative conditions, protecting
the now inactive catalytic residue from further irreversible oxidation
by reactive oxygen species.9,28−31Figure S4 confirms that mutation of residue
Cys49 (PRL-3 C49A variant) abolishes the ability to be reduced after
full oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and that the mutant is unable
to form the oxidized disulfide. The regulatory Cys49 resides directly
adjacent to Glu50 as part of the proposed CXnE motif (n = 0) in PRL-3. Therefore, mutations at
position 50 might potentially alter the enzyme’s redox properties
and thus influence its activity profile. We tested wt PRL-3 and E50R
for their potential to be reduced or oxidized in the presence of varying
amounts of dithiothreitol (DTT) or hydrogen peroxide, respectively.
As shown in Figure S4, both enzymes behaved
similarly with respect to the amount of DTT or H2O2 needed to fully reduce (activate) or oxidize (inactivate).
Also, the same DTT plateau was reached for gaining full enzymatic
activity. PRL-3 E50R was constantly about 2-fold more active than
wt PRL-3 against the DiFMUP substrate. To conclude, altered redox
properties do not seem to cause E50R’s enhanced activity. Thus,
although both cysteine and glutamic acid are part of the same structural
motif, only cysteine seems to be important for redox regulation in
PRL-3 and the full motif is not a functional entity.

2.4 PRL-3 E50R Shows Enhanced Structural Flexibility
and Decreased Stability
To address the hypothesis that the
structurally flexible nature of PRL-3 could aid in substrate turnover,
we investigated how the E50R mutation would influence structural stability
and flexibility. Several NMR structures of PRL-3 have been reported,9,20,32 all showing variations in the
structural models. The apo form of PRL-3, as well as PRL-3 bound to
small ligands, has not yet been crystallized, and our own attempts
have been futile. Recently, however, PRL-3 stabilized through the
interaction with a large protein domain was successfully crystallized.10 In contrast, several consistent crystal structures
of PRL-1, the closest homologue of PRL-3, are available in the apo
form or bound to proteins, suggesting that PRL-1 is less flexible
than PRL-3.1 We thus included PRL-1 in
this study. We first measured the thermal stability of the respective
variants. Our data clearly support trends from crystallography discussed
above: PRL-3 is considerably less stable than PRL-1 (Figure 4a,b), suggesting together with
the discussed NMR data increased conformational flexibility in PRL-3.
For PRL-3, a further decrease in stability was observed upon introduction
of the E50R mutation, whereas for PRL-1 E50R compared to PRL-1 wt,
changes were minimal. On the basis of this finding, we hypothesized
that if these shifts would contribute to enhancing the catalytic activity,
we should observe a slight increase in catalytic activity of PRL-1
E50R compared to PRL-1 wt. However, this increase should not exceed
the impact on the catalytic activity enhancement of PRL-3 E50R compared
to PRL-3 wt. As listed in Table 1b, the data we observed for DiFMUP dephosphorylation
follow exactly these expected trends: (1) the PRL-1 variants gave
similar Km values toward DiFMUP, but the
values are slightly lower than those for the respective PRL-3 variants;
(2) the Kcat values of PRL-3 and PRL-1
wt are similar, but PRL-1 E50R showed a 3.2 times higher Kcat than PRL-1 wt, whereas PRL-3 E50R’s Kcat is 6.6 times higher than that of PRL-3 wt.

Figure 4 PRL-3
is less stable than PRL-1, and the E50R mutation further
destabilizes PRL-3. (a) Enzyme thermal stability determined by a ThermoFluor
assay for PRL-3 wt and E50R, PRL-1 wt and E50R. (b) Melting temperatures
of the respective proteins.

Finally, we asked if the change of the surface potential
when introducing
Arg50 in both PRL-1 and PRL-3 (Figure S5) could have an influence on the structural flexibility difference
in both proteins. We observed a charge change in both proteins, as
expected, from the wt to the E50R variant. This change is not only
present locally in close proximity of Arg50 but also in the area around
the CXnE motif. The two best comparable
structures between PRL-1 and PRL-3, both bound to CNNM domains (5TSR and 5MMZ), suggest that the
difference of the impact of this change on both proteins is similar
and therefore this cannot clearly explain the difference in structural
flexibility or reduction in PRL-3 stability.

Together, these
data show that conformational flexibility and protein
stability have an important influence on the catalytic turnover abilities
of PRL-3. These features potentially enable the correct positioning
of Arg50 in the PRL-3 E50R variant to aid catalysis, which offers
an explanation for the enhanced catalytic activity of this variant.
With a sequence identity of 79% between the two proteins,1 however, finding the reason for the differing
structural stability will require introduction of each differing amino
acid found scattered along the sequence of PRL-1 into PRL-3 together
with thermostability analysis of the resulting variants.

2.5 PRL-3 Variant E50R Accelerates Cell Adhesion
and Migration
To investigate the biological relevance of
our biochemical findings, we compared the migration abilities of stably
overexpressing PRL-3 wt and E50R HEK293 cell lines. Enhanced cell
migration is a well-established phenotype for PRL-3 that depends on
its catalytic activity.14,16 We first controlled
for correct protein localization of PRL-3 upon introducing the E50R
point mutation (Figure 5a,b). After generation of inducible stable cell lines and control
of protein/mutant expression by Western blot (Figure 5c), also potential strong side effects on
the cell cycle were ruled out for PRL-3 variant E50R (Figure 5d).

PRL-3 variant E50R. (a, b) E50R retains wt-like
localization. HEK293 control cells were transiently transfected with
(a) mKate-PRL-3 or (b) mKate-E50R constructs and visualized by confocal

are shown. (c) Immunoblots of HEK293 FlpIn T-Rex stable cell lines

HEK293 PRL-3 wt and E50R cells show accelerated migration on fibronectin

E50R cell line. PRL-3 A111S (e) and PRL-1 (f) HEK cell lines do not
show enhanced cell migration on this substratum. (g) PRL-3 wt and
E50R cell lines show enhanced adhesion to fibronectin substratum.
Cells were seeded on the respective support and analyzed by microscopy
for percentage of adhering cells or speed of migration, respectively.
Results are shown as mean ± SD of a representative experiment.
Statistics, compared to respective control: *p =
0.0453; **p = 0.0062; ****p = 0.0001;
ns: not significant.

We next compared PRL-3 wt and E50R HEK293 stable cell lines
for
their migration behavior on different substrata. As biological migration
processes in extracellular matrix (ECM) proceed through passing matrix
layers containing fibronectin, laminin, and various forms of collagens,33−36 we investigated PRL-3 cell migration on these coatings. On laminin,
collagen-IV, collagen-I, and gelatin (Figure S6a–d), both PRL-3 and E50R cell lines migrated equally fast as the control
cell line. On fibronectin, however, PRL-3 cells showed about 1.5-fold
accelerated migration compared to control (Figure 5e), suggesting enhanced interaction of PRL-3
HEK293 cells with this ECM component. The E50R cell line showed a
more than 2-fold accelerated cell migration on fibronectin compared
to control cells (Figure 5e), exceeding the migration speed of wt PRL-3. Thus, the mutation
E50R enhances this activity-dependent cellular phenotype. Contrarily,
we observed that cells expressing the previously suggested hyperactive
A111S variant14 had a control-like phenotype
on fibronectin (Figure 5e). This we had already observed for migration on uncoated dishes;14 however, when testing our cell lines here on
standard uncoated dishes of various plastic types (Figure S7), we obtained contradictory and unpredictable migration
results, bringing the relevance of migration studies on such uncoated
support into question. Together, these results show that the PRL-3
E50R mutant, as opposed to PRL-3 A111S, accelerates PRL-3-dependent
cell migration processes on fibronectin-coated slides in agreement
with our biochemical data. Finally, we tested if the PRL-1 cell line
would show faster migration on fibronectin substratum. PRL-1 wt enhances
cell migration on uncoated support (Figure S8). However, PRL-1 did not enhance cell migration here (Figure 5f), suggesting that PRL-3 promotes
cell migration on fibronectin through a mechanism that is not shared
by PRL-1. Because both PRL-3 wt and E50R, but not PRL-1 wt and PRL-3
A111S,14 dephosphorylate PI(4,5)P2 in vitro and promote cell migration on fibronectin, this could be
a potential pathway through which PRL-3 acts here. Future studies
will need to address this question.

We next investigated if
the observed effects in cell migration
correlate with effects in cell adhesion to the respective ECM components,
as cell–matrix adhesion is a known prerequisite for cell migration
processes.33 In agreement with the observed
migration results, no difference in adhesion of the cell lines was
observed on laminin, collagen-I, collagen-IV, and gelatin (Figure S6e–h). Similarly, PRL-3 wt cells
adhered about 2-fold faster on fibronectin compared to control, and
the activity gain of the E50R variant was again reflected by a fourfold
accelerated adhesion to fibronectin substratum compared to wt PRL-3
(Figure 5g, see also Figure S9 for original microscope images). Together,
these results suggest that PRL-3-driven HEK293 cell migration relates
to an adhesion advantage to the respective substratum and that the
choice of substratum layer seems of importance for the promotion of
cell migration by PRL-3. Further studies are required to corroborate
this observation, with special attention given to integrin repertoires.
Integrins are the major receptors responsible for engaging in specific
cell–ECM contacts,37 and they were
shown to rely on (phospho)lipid compositions.38 Accordingly, PRL-3/E50R might affect integrin composition and/or
function by its action on PI(4,5)P2. In addition, cell
adhesion to fibronectin was reported to correlate with tumorigenicity,39,40 and it is tempting to speculate that the observed PRL-3-dependent
effect could represent a potential link to its tumorigenic potential.
Of note, mutation E50R is not found among the so-far known PRL-3 cancer
mutations summarized in the COSMIC database for PTP4A3.41

3 Conclusions
To conclude, we show here that PRL-3’s
catalytic mechanism
and active-site architecture differ from those of other PTPs regarding
the role of the glutamic acid within the proposed structural CXnE motif, which in PRL-3 does not appear to be
a functional entity. Glu50 in PRL-3, and also in PRL-1, can be replaced
without structural and catalytic impairment of the phosphatases. However,
PRL-3 is structurally more flexible and less stable than PRL-1, which
explains at least in part the differences seen here in the catalytic
behavior.

PRL-3 E50R’s structural flexibility demonstrated
here could
place Arg50 in a favorable position to enhance catalytic turnover.
Although the detailed mechanism remains unclear, possible mechanisms
could be Arg50 providing a hydrogen bond to aid in the second catalytic
step of phosphate hydrolysis from the active-site cysteine or Arg50
positioning the WPD-loop favorably for catalysis, or given the flexibility
of PRL-3, both these interactions could transiently be happening during
catalysis. Future studies including mutational analyses will address
these hypotheses.

A defined, moderate enhancement of enzymatic
activity can be explored
to study the respective enzyme by revealing a stronger but not arbitrary
phenotype or increasing substrate turnover to allow its identification.
Activity-enhancing variants have been successfully applied to study
various enzymes in the past.42−44 Accordingly, PRL-3 E50R could
represent a novel tool for potentiating PRL-3 activity in vitro and
in cellular applications, as it shows enhanced phosphatase activity
toward all tested in vitro substrates, similar substrate specificity
to the wt protein with regard to phosphoinositides, and enhanced PRL-3-dependent
cellular phenotypes.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
FBS was obtained from Gibco
or Sigma (Sigma Lot #014M3395 for cell migration experiments). Di-C8:0-phosphoinositide
phosphates were ordered from Avanti Polar Lipids or Echelon. PRL-3
inhibitor analog 3 was purchased from Enamine.19 6,8-Difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate
(DiFMUP) was obtained from Life Technologies, and all other chemicals
were purchased from Sigma or Merck. Standard cell culture dishes were

with various matrix component coatings were purchased from Corning.

4.2 Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Cloning
Plasmid vector pETM-20 was used for bacterial overexpression of
recombinant PRL phosphatase wt and variants. PTEN and variants were
overexpressed as GST-tagged fusion proteins using pGEX-4T-1 plasmid
vector. Escherichia coli Top10 strain
was used for cloning of recombinant DNA, and BL21 DE3 strain was used
for protein expression. The different mutations were constructed by
site-directed mutagenesis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the
following primer pairs. PRL-3 E50Q: 5′ gcgtgtgtgtcaagtgacctat
3′ and 5′ ataggtcacttgacacacacgc 3′; PRL-3 E50A:

3′. All generated constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
pmKate-2N plasmid vector was used for fluorescently labeled constructs
for transient mammalian expression. E50R mutation was generated from
wt PRL-3 using the above-mentioned primer pair. pcDNA5/FRT/TO construct
for creation of the stable E50R cell line was cloned from pcDNA5/FRT/TO[3Flag-PRL-3]
plasmid obtained from G. Varsano (EMBL) using the same primer pair
as above. The respective stable A111S cell line was created as reported
previously.14

4.3 Protein
Expression and Purification
Wt PRL-3 as well as the respective
protein variants were prepared
as previously described,16 yielding pure
protein in all cases. PTEN and variants were prepared as GST-fusion
proteins as previously described,14 with
the following modifications. The purification was performed in two
steps. From GSTrap column purification, the proteins were eluted in
50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM glutathione, and
5 mM DTT. To purify the proteins further, ion-exchange chromatography
was performed.

4.4 CD Spectroscopy
Circular dichroism
experiments were performed on a Jasco J-715 spectrophotometer, using
Quartz cuvette 110-QS from Hellma Analytics. The experiments were
performed at 20 °C. Proteins were measured in a buffer containing
20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT. Protein concentrations
were 0.17 mg mL–1 for all CD spectra recordings
and 0.48 mg/mL for all thermal stability measurements. Far-UV spectra
were recorded between 200 and 250 nm and normalized to the respective
buffer control. Data were collected in triplicates and averaged for
each protein. Thermal stability was observed at 223 nm, over a temperature
range of 20–95 °C. Stability data were analyzed using
GraphPad Prism 6.0 software and asymmetric sigmoidal curve fitting.

4.5 In Vitro Phosphatase Activity Assays
Dephosphorylation
assays using DiFMUP as phosphosubstrate were performed
as previously described for wt PRL-3.16 Mutant enzymes were treated accordingly, with enzyme concentrations
of 50 nM and DiFMUP concentration of 21 μM used in all cases.
Inhibition with analog 3 was performed as described
previously.16 Assays using substrate 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) were performed in an
assay buffer containing 40 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
and 10 mM DTT. OMFP concentration was 600 μM. Enzyme concentration
was 6 μM. Absorbance at 450 nm was monitored over time. Dephosphorylation
of soluble phosphoinositide phosphates was performed using the purine
nucleoside phosphorylase-coupled EnzChek Phosphate Assay Kit (Molecular
Probes), according to the provider’s instructions. DTT concentration
was kept 10 mM in all cases to ensure full cysteine reduction and
therefore maximal enzyme activity. Enzymes were used at 6 μM
concentration and preincubated in DTT-containing assay buffer at least
10 min prior to starting the assay. Kinetic recordings were performed
at 37 °C. For single measurements comparing various PIP species,
PIPs were kept at 100 μM assay concentration. Initial velocities
were calculated from the slope of the linear part of the proceeding
reaction. For kinetic titrations, PI(4,5)P2 substrate was
used in a concentration series range between 150 and 0.4 μM.
Log (PIP concentration) was plotted against reaction velocity. All
data were recorded on a Tecan multiwell plate reader and analyzed
with GraphPad Prism 6 software. All measurements were performed in
triplicate, with two (PIP titration) or three (all other) independent
experiments.

4.6 Thermofluor Analysis
The thermostability
of purified PRL-3 and PRL-1 in both wt and E50R variants was analyzed
with ThermoFluor technology.45 In detail,
6 μM concentration of each purified protein was incubated with
SYPRO orange solution (Thermo Fischer Scientific, S-6651) in 20 mM
TRIS, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT. With a StepOne Plus Real-Time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems), the samples were subjected to a temperature
gradient of 4–95 °C (over a period of 3 h), simultaneously
measuring the emitted fluorescence signal. The melting temperature
was obtained using a two-state fitting model. The reported Tm in Figure 4b corresponds to the first melting temperature.

4.7 Cell Culture and Generation of Inducible Stable
Cell Lines
Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium containing 4.5 g L–1 glucose,
10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin
solution and grown in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HEK FlpIn T-Rex 293 cells (Invitrogen) were used to create
inducible stable cell lines expressing Flag-tagged phosphatase (variant),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as previously
reported for wt PRL-3.16 Stable cell lines
were grown in selection medium supplemented with 15 μg mL–1 blasticidin and 100 μg mL–1 hygromycin. Protein expression was induced by the addition of tetracycline
(1 μg mL–1) 20 h prior to experimentation.

4.8 Western Blot
HEK293 stable cell lines
were lysed in standard HNTG lysis buffer, and cleared lysate was normalized
to total protein amount and subjected to sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis using anti-PRL-3-specific
monoclonal antibody (mouse, EMBL in-house antibody facility, clone
1E7, used 1:1000). Blocking was performed in TBS-Tween (0.1% (v/v))
containing 5% (w/v) BSA, according to standard procedures. Anti-tubulin-specific
antibody (mouse, Sigma, clone T-5168, used 1:5000) was used according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Detection of respective
peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Sigma or GE Healthcare, used
1:10 000) was carried out with ECL prime reagents from Amersham.

4.9 Confocal Microscopy
Transient transfection
of mKate-labeled protein cDNA was carried out using Fugene-HD (Roche;
5 μL/μg DNA). HEK293 control cells were transfected with
0.5 μg of DNA construct 18 h before imaging on a Leica SP2 confocal
microscope equipped with a 63× oil lense. Imaging was performed
at room temperature. The following imaging buffer was used: 20 mM
HEPES, pH 7.4, 115 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM K2HPO4, and 2 g L–1 glucose. Pictures were taken using Leica confocal software.

4.10 Cell Adhesion Experiments
Cell adhesion
assays were performed at room temperature on a Leica DMI 4000 B widefield
microscope with a 20× objective. Tetracycline-induced HEK293
stable cell lines were collected and seeded into the respective precoated
or uncoated cell culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells mL–1 at time point zero. At the respective
time points, pictures of the adhering cells were taken (three pictures
per condition) and counted according to cell morphology, distinguishing
between round/unattached cells and adhering cells with visible protrusions
and a flat shape. Fibronectin plates were monitored 20 min after seeding.
Data are presented as percent of adhering cells over total cells.
Independent experiments were performed at least in triplicate.

4.11 Cell Migration Experiments
Cell
migration was monitored as wound healing assay on a Zeiss Cell Observer
HS widefield microscope with a 10× objective. A total of 9 ×
105 cells mL–1 of the respective HEK293
stable cell lines were seeded into fibronectin-coated plates (Corning)
and allowed to settle for 20 h in the presence of tetracycline. The
plates were manually equipped with migration inserts for self-insertion
(Ibidi) by placing the insert with sterile tweezers and gently pressing
it onto the plate. Cell culture dishes and matrix component-precoated
plates were used according to the information in the text. On the
day of experimentation, new growth medium was added containing 7.5%
(v/v) FBS (Sigma), and the inserts were gently removed with sterile
tweezers. Dishes were kept at 37 °C, and pictures of the wound
gap were taken at 0 and 1.5 h time points, using Zeiss ZEN software.
All pictures were analyzed with Fiji software according to length
(unit) difference of the remaining wound gap and presented as speed
of migration (unit/h). Independent experiments were performed at least
in triplicate.

4.12 Statistical Analysis
Multiple samples
were compared to respective control or wt enzyme by one-way ANOVA
with Dunnett correction. Two individual samples were compared by unpaired
two-sided Student’s t-test with Welch correction.
