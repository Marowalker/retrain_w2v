The standardization
of secondary electrolytic conductivity cells
requires the use of a certified reference material. The accepted certification
method involves electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to estimate
the material’s solution resistance. This method normally assumes
that the impedance’s imaginary component can be neglected;
and hence, the measured impedance approximates the real impedance.
Thus, a linear extrapolation of the impedance versus the period (inverse
frequency) yields solution resistance. However, experimental impedance
data usually do not exhibit a linear behavior over the spectra of
frequency, which strongly suggest that the ideal capacitive assumption
may not strictly apply. To account for the observed nonlinear behavior,
we have proposed to introduce the concept of a constant phase element
(CPE) to the analysis of impedance. This approach leads to the development
of a relationship that improves the fitting of experimental data and
improves the accuracy of the estimation, by establishing a critical
frequency where extrapolation should be done. Finally, we are presenting
simulated results to demonstrate how sizeable capacitive effects can
influence the determination of solution resistance, and a final analysis
to estimate the impact on constant cell or electrolytic conductivity
values.

1 Introduction
Electrolytic conductivity κ is one of the parameters that
are most widely used in industrial, environmental, and pharmaceutical
fields. Its measurement uses devices that require calibration with
certified reference materials (CRMs). These CRMs are certified using
primary or secondary systems, provided mainly by National Metrology
Institutes or other designated institutes.

From the scientific
and metrological points of view, this measurement
is interesting and actually stands under investigation, because some
problems remain unsolved when solutions with very high (like seawater)
or very low (like high-purity water) ion content are used, particularly
in the solution resistance value estimation.1,2

During typical electrochemical experiments, solution resistance
is almost eliminated, leading to neglection of its value, by adding
an excess of ions that transport charge from an interface to another.
In this way, practically, only processes and overpotentials at electrodes
are considered and deeply studied.3,4 For κ
measurements, this action cannot be used because solution resistance
represents the variable of interest.5,6

In practice,
solution conductivity κ is determined from a
cell constant Kcell, previously known,
and solution resistance Rs, by using eq 1. 1  For primary systems, the cell constant can
be determined by precisely measuring cell dimensions, and for secondary
systems by using a certified reference material (CRM). The solution
resistance is obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements.

From these EIS measurements, real and imaginary
impedance components
are obtained. Resistances as Rs are mainly
associated with the real part of impedance. These measurements need
a prior evaluation of the frequency interval and the sinusoidal signal
amplitude to assess the optimal measurement conditions.7 Usually, Rs is obtained
from a linear extrapolation to an infinite frequency of the real part
of impedance versus period (inverse of frequency).6 That linear extrapolation comes from Hoover investigation,8 where different equations were used to fit resistance
measurement. However, in all cases, an ideal capacitor was considered.
This introduces deviations that affect the accuracy of the estimation,
as shown in the discussion, because solid electrodes do not present
ideal capacitances.3

This paper explores
the effects of using a different approach that
is censed to improve the accuracy of the internationally accepted
method for the estimation of Rs by considering
the nonideality of capacitance. Here, we introduce the use of equivalent
circuits containing nonideal capacitive behavior to account for deviations
in measured impedance and propose the use of such circuits for the
best fitting of the experimental impedance data. We also discuss the
implications that the nonideal capacitance has on the solution resistance
evaluation; i.e., its estimation obtained from the accepted methodology.
An important contribution that helps specialists to improve regression
values by introducing the concept of a critical frequency is included.
Finally, simulated spectra are presented, which could explain some
behavior observed in experimental data represented in Nyquist and
Bode plots.

2 Mathematical Model
Our proposed approach
uses equivalent circuits; such circuits are
frequently used to estimate electrochemical parameters. In this case,
the suitable elementary circuit is a simple and common one (Figure 1a).

Figure 1 Equivalent circuits with
ideal capacitance (a) and considering
nonideal capacitance (b), where Rs represents
solution resistance, Cdl represents the
double-layer capacitance, and Rct represents
the charge transfer resistance.

The above circuit intrinsically assumes that the electrodes possess
flat and homogeneous surfaces of well-defined geometries; hence, its
model treats the double-layer capacitance as an ideal capacitor. However,
in electrochemical systems with solid electrodes, this assumption
does not hold, and the revised model circuit, shown in Figure 1b, better approximates the
true behavior.3,9−11

Here, Rs and Rct have the
same meaning as indicated above. CPE or the constant
phase element represents the nonideal capacitance, which has been
empirically defined as follows3 2  where
α accounts for the nonideal behavior
of the capacitance and typically represents an exponent less than
1 and in the range of 0.70–0.99.3j is the imaginary number, and ω stands for
the angular frequency ω = 2πf, where f is the frequency in Hertz. Thus, the use of a CPE introduces
an additional parameter and generally improves the model’s
fitting, and it is censed to represent the dispersive behavior of
the capacitance with frequency in solid electrodes.3

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Analysis of Total Impedance When the CPE is
Included
By Kirchhoff’s laws, the total impedance
of the equivalent circuit containing the CPE is 3  where Z represents the total
impedance, ZRs and ZRct represent the impedance of solution and charge transfer contributions,
and ZCPE represents CPE impedance.

By decomposing ZCPE into its real and
imaginary components, applying the De Moivre’s theorem and
introducing this result in the expression of Z, eq 3, we get the real (Z′) and imaginary (Z″) components
as12 4   5  It is important to note that both the real
and imaginary components depend on the resistances as well as on the
nonideal capacitance. It is easily evidenced from eq 4 that a no-simple linear relationship
exists between Z′ and ω when nonideal
capacitance is taken into account. Thus, a plot of Z′ vs 1/ω, or equivalently, Z′
vs 1/f, is not going to give a strict line with Rs as the y-intercept, as assumed
by the accepted method.8 Instead, a more
complex relationship is expected. A deeper analysis of eq 4 leads to the conclusion that this
expression can be simplified if the term 1/Rct is negligible when compared to the term depending on the
frequency. Thus, we can define two cases, depending on whether 1/Rct is negligible or not, compared to the frequency-dependent
term. We are identifying this term as Y′CPE, according to the equation 6  Thus, it can be established that
there exists
a cutoff or critical frequency ωc that can be obtained
by setting the following equation, which compares the terms where Rct is involved in eq 4 7  or
in terms of frequency 8a   8b  This
relationship permits us to estimate the
frequency above which the term 1/Rct becomes
lower than Y′CPE and even negligible.
It is important to remark that this frequency should be the lower
limit to make an extrapolation assuring linear behavior.

3.2 Case 1: 1/Rct is
Negligible
This first case implies that Rct is high. This usually occurs when the measurement is
made at an open circuit potential or when an applied overpotential
does not favor electrochemical reactions; i.e., low polarization potentials
and low amplitude signals. In these conditions, the term 1/Rct becomes negligible as compared to Y′CPE and eq 4 simplifies into 9  Or in terms of f 10  It is
clearly seen that under this assumption,
there is a linear correlation between Z′ and f–α, but not on f–1. As a consequence, a graph of Z′ vs f–1, as currently
done, is going to produce deviations of the linear behavior and, thus,
inaccurate estimations of Rs. This is
illustrated in Figure 2 with an example of spectra simulated with the equivalent circuit
that includes the CPE. The parameters employed in the simulation are Rs = 10 Ω, Cdl = 1 × 10–5 F, α = 0.9, Rct = 1 × 105 Ω, a frequency range
from 1 Hz to 100 kHz, and 15 points per decade.

Figure 2 Example of simulated
spectra with an equivalent circuit that includes
the CPE. Rs = 10 Ω, Cdl = 1 × 10–5 F, α = 0.9, Rct = 1 × 105 Ω, a frequency
range from 1 Hz to 100 kHz, and 15 points per decade. Nyquist plot
(a) Bode module and phase (b upper and lower) and Z′ regression (c).

The simulated spectra have the typical form found in systems with
solid electrodes, where there is no electrochemical reaction, i.e.,
they behave as ideally polarizable electrodes: A Nyquist diagram (Figure 2a) shows a mainly
capacitive spectrum, where the high-frequency limit tends to the Rs value (10 Ω in this case). Bode diagrams
(Figure 2b) show more
clearly the predominance frequency region for the capacitive (low
frequencies) and resistive (high frequencies) behaviors and the expected
high-frequency limit.

By using eq 8a and 8b and the parameters employed
for the simulation,
we can estimate that fc = 0.35 Hz for
this example. If we use this fc as a limit
when extrapolated, deviations at extrapolation will be important near
this value, so the authors propose to select a higher frequency as
the operative limit. Assuming as a first approach that 1/Rct is going to be negligible above one hundred times this
value, it can be established that eq 10 is going to be more precise for f > 35 Hz. This frequency is marked in Nyquist and Bode diagrams.
A graph of Z′ vs f–α above this frequency, Figure 2c, shows a very good fitting to a straight line, getting a
regression coefficient (R2) of unity and y-intersection = 9.9833 Ω, i.e., an error of −0.167%
relative to the exact value (10 Ω). In contrast, as also evidenced
in Figure 2c, a graph
of Z′ vs f–1 shows obvious deviations from the linear tendency for the same frequency
range and gives a lower regression coefficient (0.9979) and a higher
error (3.42%) in the Rs estimated value
of 10.3417 Ω. It is important to remark that the frequency range
employed for the linear regression was the same in both cases, ranging
from 35 and 39.8 Hz (the next immediate frequency from 35 Hz) to 100
kHz.

It is worth noting that the relevance of having a way to
calculate
a critical frequency that lets us to define the frequency range, where
the linear approximation is going to be more precise. Until now, the
way to define this range in practice was arbitrary and dependent on
the appreciation of the analyst, with the added drawback of using
a wrong correlation in f–1. The
results showed in this work permits us to suggest concrete improvements
to the current methodology for accurate Rs measurements.

3.3 Case 2: 1/Rct is
Not Negligible
This corresponds to situations where Rct is low so a clear semicircle tendency in
the Nyquist plot is observed. This implies the presence of electrochemical
reactions at the surface of the electrodes, like evolving of H2 or O2, that are produced by high polarization
potentials or high amplitude signals. In this case, reciprocal of Rct cannot be neglected and complete real component
mathematical expression, eq 4, should be considered. This makes the correlation of Z′ with the frequency more complex. As an example
to illustrate this situation, we have simulated spectra considering
the same parameter values used in simulation on case 1 (Rs = 10 Ω, Cdl = 1 ×
10–5 F, α = 0.9, a frequency range from 1
Hz to 100 kHz, and 15 points per decade) but changing Rct = 50 Ω, i.e., a low value. The resulting spectra
are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Simulated spectra with an equivalent circuit that includes the
CPE. Rs = 10 Ω, Cdl = 1 × 10–5 F, Rct = 50 Ω, α = 0.9, a frequency range from
1 Hz to 100 kHz, 15 points per decade. Nyquist plot (a) Bode module
and phase (b upper and lower) and Z′ regression
(C).

Here, we can see in the Nyquist
plot a well-defined semi loop,
whose diameter corresponds to the value of Rct and the high-frequency limit is Rs. The height is slightly lower than the half of the diameter because
of the nonideal capacitance (α = 0.9). Respective Bode plots
confirm the predominance of the capacitive contribution in the mid-frequency
range and the resistive contribution in the lowest and highest frequency
range. These are the typical spectra obtained in real systems when
electrochemical reactions are taking place at the surface of solid
electrodes. The plot of Z′ against f–1 and f–α, Figure 3c, shows
that both traces are remarkably nonlinear in the whole range of frequencies:
Up to three regions of different and variable slopes are evidenced,
making uncertain any extrapolation. The estimation of fc for this set of simulation parameters shows that the
linear approach for f–α will
be more precise for f > 162 kHz, which is beyond
the simulated high-frequency limit (100 kHz) and is difficult to obtain
experimentally without the influence of measurement artifacts. As
a consequence, it is not recommended to obtain κ estimations
by this method in the presence of reactions on the electrodes. This
means that measurements should be made at the open circuit potential
OCP or low polarization and small amplitudes on inert electrodes.

3.4 Influence of Rct
Because Rct is an important
parameter, as demonstrated in previous sections, we decided to evaluate
its effect in a wide range of Rs estimations.
Thus, we simulated impedance spectra with Rct ranging from 100 Ω to 100 kΩ, and another parameter
with the same value as depicted above. Then, linear fitting was applied
for all of the spectra between 1 and 100 kHz to obtain Rs. The results are presented in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Effect of Rct on Rs estimation at simulated spectra (Rs = 10 Ω, Cdl = 1 ×
10–5 F, α = 0.9, a frequency range from 1
Hz to 100 kHz, and 15 points per decade).

In this graph, it is worth remarking that the estimation using f–α is significantly more precise
for high Rct values (Rct ≥ 1 kΩ), but it presents large deviations
for the low ones. It is attributed to the fact that the range of frequencies
considered to do the linear fitting comprises low frequencies that
are out of the range, where 1/Rct is negligible.
To confirm this, new simulations were done with the same parameters
than the above, but this time, fc was
estimated and employed for each simulated spectrum to define the appropriate
frequency range to apply the linear approach with f–α. Once this range for each spectrum is
defined, linear fitting was applied on it to estimate Rs. The results are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Effect of Rct on Rs estimation at simulated spectra (Rs = 10 Ω, Cdl = 1 ×
10–5 F, α = 0.9, a frequency range from 1
Hz to 100 kHz, and 15 points per decade), using fc to define the appropriate frequency range to apply the
linear approach with f–α.

It is evidenced that in this case, the new proposed
fitting for f–α gives always
better results
compared with the actual estimation with f–1. Here, we observe that the estimation of Rs by using the extrapolation with f–α is very close to the exact value, while the extrapolation with f–1 gives larger deviations when Rct is high. These deviations are reduced with
small values of Rct and become close to
that produced by the f–α extrapolation.
The fact that the deviations are lower for low Rct is attributed to the fact that Rs is the high-frequency limit of Z′, so that
the higher the frequency, the more accurate the approximation should
be. However, the number of frequencies that can be included in the
fitting, according to this method, is lower for the lower values of Rct (see Table 1), making it, as a consequence, less robust. Another
drawback is that, in practice, measurements with conventional potentiostats
usually present artifacts that introduce additional experimental deviations
for f > 10 kHz. Thus, the recommendation is to
do
the fitting in the frequency range, where 1/Rct becomes negligible but including if possible the lowest
frequencies in this range. Table 1 reports the calculated fc and the relative error in the estimation of Rs.

100	750	10.0031	9.9995	3	0.0307	–0.0046	
It is worth remarking that
errors for the f–α extrapolation
method are, for all of the Rct values
tested here, at least one order of
magnitude smaller than those observed for the f–1 method. This leads us to the confirmation that the
inclusion of the concept of nonideal capacitance (by including a CPE)
in the modeling and treatment of impedance measurements permits us
to obtain a more accurate estimation of Rs and, as a consequence, a more accurate estimation of κ. This
is a very relevant issue for κ measurements of certain systems
like high-purity water.2,6 These results also remark the
relevance of obtaining the cutoff or critical frequency to establish
the adequate frequency range to do the linear fitting.

3.5 Influence of α
To make analysis
of nonideal capacitance, particularly α effects on impedance
spectra, simulations were carried out at similar conditions to that
in case 1a (Rs = 10 Ω; Rct = 100 kΩ, Cdl = 10–5 F/cm2, frequency range from 1 Hz to 100
kHz, and 15 points per decade), but changing α from 0.95 to
0.7 (lowest typical value for solid electrodes in aqueous media). Figure 6 shows the resultant
spectra.

Figure 6 α effect on simulated impedance spectra: Nyquist plot (a);
Bode module and phase (b upper and lower).

Slight changes are observed in the size of the spectra, getting
smaller when α is reduced. In experimental spectra, it occurs
when surface roughness increases, provoking a more heterogeneous solid–liquid
interface. Some authors have also related this parameter α to
the fractal dimension parameter.13 Data
treatment similar to that already employed above, calculating fc for each spectrum from the parameters of the
equivalent circuit and then selecting from the highest fc the frequency range (44 points, from 136 Hz to 100 kHz)
to do linear fitting, the values of which are presented in Table 2.

Table 2 α Effect on the Calculated fc Values,
Intercept Values, and Errors against
Nominal Values
 	 	y-intercept (Ω)	error
%	
α	fc (Hz)	f–1 method	f–α method	f–1 method	f–α method	
0.95	1.2653	10.0399	9.9964	0.399	–0.0361	
0.90	0.3479	10.1440	9.9977	1.440	–0.0231	
0.85	0.1156	10.2767	9.9986	2.767	–0.0145	
0.80	0.0388	10.4178	9.9991	4.178	–0.0089	
0.75	0.0123	10.5542	9.9995	5.542	–0.0053	
0.70	0.0035	10.6782	9.9997	6.782	–0.0030	
It is evidenced that linear fitting with the f–α method is always superior in
accuracy
to that based on the f–1 method:
Relative error for the f–α method is one up to three orders of magnitude smaller than that
for the f–1 method. In addition, f–α is more accurate for lower values
of α. It means that the more nonideal the capacitance is, the
better results the proposed method gets. On the contrary, the f–1 method gives larger errors for smaller
values of α, and only works well for ideal capacitances.

3.6 Experimental Example
This methodology
was applied to experimental data, whose spectra are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Experimental data used
as an example. Nyquist plot (a), Bode module
and phase (b upper and lower) and Z′ regression
(c).

The studied solution was a calibrated
solution of KCl with a certified
value of 1000.3 ± 1.0 μS/cm. Impedance plots show spectra
with a similar form than that of Figure 2, but more depressed (smaller slope) and
in a narrower frequency range. Fitting of the spectra gives the following
values for the parameters of the equivalent circuit model: Rs = 2127 Ω, Rct = 1.2 × 107 Ω, Cdl = 4.3 × 10–5 F, α = 0.82. From these,
the estimation of the critical frequency gives fc = 4.1 × 10–5 Hz. Thus, the graph of Z′ vs f–α for f > 4.1 × 10–3 Hz
should
give a linear trend. Such a low cutoff frequency means in this case
that all of the available experimental data are in the frequency range
that makes valid the assumption that 1/Rct is negligible. Indeed, as expected, a line with R2 = 0.9956 and y-intercept = 2192.9 Ω
is obtained, Figure 7c. In contrast, linear fitting with f–1 for the same range gives a lower correlation (R2 = 0.9858) and y-intercept = 2205.3
Ω.

A difference of 12 Ω approximately can affect
in two possible
ways:1. Constant
cell: By using certified value
and both Rs, there is a difference of
constant cell of 0.012 cm–1, which is important
and could represent significant bias.

2. Electrolytic conductivity: Considering
that this value is employed to estimate κ of an unknown solution,
measuring with a cell with a nominal value of 1 cm–1, κ could be modified from 453.45 to 456.02 μS/cm. This
difference is similar to uncertainty reported for some secondary reference
materials.14



As a consequence, the recommendation is to use the f–α approach as an improvement of the f–1 method. Even if from a practical point
of view, errors in Rs measurements for
the κ estimation will be reduced because these are obtained
by measuring at two different conditions,5 additional improvement can be achieved if accuracy in the Rs estimation is also improved, as it has been
identified as an important issue since Hoover’s work.8

4 Conclusions
Actual
methodology to estimate solution’s resistance only
considers ideal capacitive contributions to impedance measurements;
however, from a more rigorous point of view, neglecting the nonideal
capacitive contribution to the real part is not correct and leads
to inaccuracy. An improvement is obtained by considering the contribution
of a nonideal capacitance (CPE) on the real component and the estimation
of a critical frequency that permits us to define a suitable frequency
range to do a linear fitting. Analysis indicates that linearity is
observed only at the open circuit potential or no electrochemical
reaction conditions, by using f–α instead of f–1 in the abscissa
axis. Thus, this condition should be assured to improve accuracy.
