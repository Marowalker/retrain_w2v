Intrinsic mobility of electrons at
the interfaces between crystalline
organic semiconductors and insulating dielectric polymer films was
rapidly evaluated in an ambient atmosphere by TRMC@Interfaces, a noncontact and nondestructive method based on dielectric loss
spectroscopy of microwaves. By just preparing simple metal–insulator–semiconductor
devices, local-scale motions of charge carriers injected into the
interface by pulses of gate bias voltage were monitored through reflected
microwave changes, resulting in the evaluation of local-scale charge
carrier mobilities together with the value of trap density at the
interface. The evaluated high electron mobilities of 12 cm2 V–1 s–1 for N,N′-bis(cyclohexyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)
(DCy-NDI) and 15 cm2 V–1 s–1 for N,N′-dioctylperylene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)
(DC8-PDI) are the
benchmarks for organic semiconducting materials that are comparable
with the highest ones reported from the field-effect transistor devices.
The present TRMC@Interfaces was found to serve as
a rapid screening technique to examine the intrinsic performance of
organic semiconducting materials as well as a useful tool enabling
the precise discussion on the relationship among their local-scale
charge carrier mobility, thin-film morphology, and packing structure.

Introduction
Versatile and convenient
methods to access the charge carrier transport
property of organic semiconductors are highly in demand along with
the recent progress of organic electronics. Representative techniques
commonly used so far include the Hall effect, field-effect transistors
(FETs), time-of-flight, and space charge limited current, where the
long-range translational motion of the generated/injected charge carriers
(hole or electron) contributes to the analytical theories used in
their evaluation processes. The FET method has attracted particular
attention because FETs work as switching devices important for integrated
circuits.1−4 However, FET has several requisites to operate, such as proper injection
of electrons from a source to the semiconductor layer, and then to
drain. Thus, a tedious device optimization process is required before
FET operation, resulting in the time-consuming issue to judge the
potential of the target semiconducting materials. Microwave dielectric
loss spectroscopy has provided an electrodeless platform for the measurement
of local-scale motion of charge carriers injected by ionizing radiations,5,6 photocarrier injection into organic heterojunctions,7−9 and/or inorganic semiconductors,10,11 demonstrating
the versatile and prompt diagnosis of mobility free from the device
optimization processes. A planar microstrip microwave resonator was
also designed, offering a wide flexibility of the measurement system
for electron/hole-transporting semiconductor films.12 We have recently developed a microwave-based evaluation
technique (time-resolved microwave conductivity: TRMC@Interfaces)13−17 that uses dielectric loss spectroscopy of field-induced charge carriers
in simple metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) devices.
In this method, hole or electron carriers are injected at the insulator–semiconductor
interfaces of the MIS device by applying pulse gate bias (Vg) (Figure 1b). Simultaneously, the local-scale motions of the
charge carriers are independently monitored by microwave-based dielectric
loss spectroscopy toward the MIS device set in a resonant cavity.
This fully experimental technique eventually provides local-scale,
intrinsic hole/electron mobility as well as trap density particularly
at the insulator–semiconductor interfaces. Using this technique,
we have reported the mobility of pentacene and heteroacene derivatives,
revealing high intrinsic hole mobilities (e.g., ∼6 cm2 V–1 s–1 for pentacene).13,14 In the present study, we focused on the rapid evaluation of the
electron transport property even in an ambient atmosphere with the
TRMC@Interfaces technique. Investigating n-type semiconducting
character is a more challenging issue than that of holes due to the
effect of impurities containing water and oxygen that severely inhibit
the long-range translational motion of electrons in the device.23 Thus, evaluation of electron transport property
has mostly been addressed under high-vacuum conditions. Here, we tried
to determine electron mobilities of relatively air-stable arylenediimides
in an ambient atmosphere with a simple device structure. Because the
characterized mobilities are dominantly based on the intragrain motion,
the observed high-mobility values were discussed correlating with
the crystalline order of semiconducting molecules.

Results and Discussion
N,N-bis(cyclohexyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)
(DCy-NDI),18N,N′-dioctylperylene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)
(DC8-PDI),19 and N,N′-bis(cyclohexyl)perylene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)
(DCy-PDI)20 are chosen as
semiconducting layer materials (Figure 1a) because these are well-known n-type materials applied
in FETs and organic photovoltaic devices.21,22 MIS devices were fabricated according to the previous reports13,14 (see the Experimental Section). The microwave
circuit was constructed using a waveguide system with a homodyne setup
(Figure 1b) and our
previous report.13 Other detailed experimental
methods are described in the Experimental Section. As shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information),
the resonance of microwave was successfully obtained when a MIS device
was loaded in the cavity. It should be noted that the change in the
capacitance value upon applied gate bias was monitored by means of
the displacement current measurement (DCM) of the MIS device, suggesting
that charge carriers were certainly injected into the insulator–semiconductor
interface (Figure S2).

Evaluation of Electron
Mobility for DCy-NDI in
an Ambient Atmosphere and at Controlled Temperature
Figure 2 shows typical microwave
and current transients for a DCy-NDI-based MIS device.
After the MIS device was set in the cavity, a 50 ms pulse gate bias
(Vg(t)) was applied to
inject electrons at the DCy-NDI–poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) interface. Accordingly, electric current (I(t)) was monitored, which can be converted to the
charge amount (q(t)) profile by
integrating I(t) with time (Figure 2a). In parallel with
the current-flow monitoring, the changes in reflected microwave power
(ΔPr(t)) were confirmed
to respond to the gate bias voltages (Figure 2b). Although the relatively slow decay of
ΔPr at 50–80 ms in Figure 2b suggested the presence
of some barrier for the discharging process of electrons, the shape
of the ΔPr(t) curves
was basically similar to that of the q(t) traces, proving that the resulted dielectric loss phenomenon was
contributed by the injected electrons. In the TRMC@Interfaces measurement, the transient dielectric loss (Δ(1/Q)) in the cavity is proportional to the conductivity changes (Δσ) 1  where e, ε, ω,
and Δn are the elementary charge, dielectric
constant, angular frequency of microwave, and change in the charge
carrier density, respectively. The linearity between ΔPr and Δ(1/Q) was preserved
in the present range of ΔPr,13 and hence, the pseudoconductivity (ΔNμ) was calculated from the saturated value of ΔPr for each Vg using
the reported calibration equation below.13 2  On
the other hand, the numbers of injected
charge carriers (Ninj) were easily calculated
from the saturated value of q(t)
(at 50 ms). From the sets of pseudoconductivity ΔNμ and injected carriers Ninj, the Ninj–ΔNμ
plot was obtained (Figure 2c), where the first derivative represents electron mobility.
It comprises four regions: (i) the silent region of Ninj < 0.5 × 1011, (ii) high-mobility
region, (iii) slightly lower mobility region, and (iv) saturation
region. The first silent region corresponds to carrier trapping at
the interface (ntrap ∼ 5 ×
1011 cm–2).14 After filling up the traps, the second region appears where a higher
mobility is estimated than that of region (iii). We consider that
this second region reflects intrabulk mobility. With a weak gate bias,
charge carriers are injected not only at the interface but also into
the bulk region because of thermal diffusion.24 As the interface is affected by the random potential of insulators,
it can be expected that the bulk mobility is higher than that near
the interface. For this reason, we ascribed the mobility estimated
from region (iii) to the interfacial mobility. Application of further
higher gate voltages results in the saturation of the mobility (iv).
The explanation of high-injection region is debatable, but there is
a clue to elucidate this phenomenon: the saturation of microwave signal
in the high-injection regime completely disappears under vacuum conditions
(Figure S3). This contrast was observed
in different devices with reproducibility. We, at present, have no
absolute evidence but suppose that oxygen or water molecules could
deteriorate the conduction of electron in the high concentration of
anionic species. It should be noted that the estimated mobility (slope)
was comparable between ambient atmosphere and vacuum conditions for
each DCy-NDI device.

The XRD analysis of the DCy-NDI MIS device revealed
an ordered layer structure (d100 = 18.1
Å) of NDI cores (Figure 2d), where the layer distance agrees with the reported single
crystal structure.20,25 A smooth surface of polycrystalline
semiconducting layer with a small root-mean-square roughness of 4.0
nm was visualized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure 2e and Table S1). The transport mechanism of the local-scale motions of
these highly mobile charge carriers is another important subject.
The prototype of low-temperature TRMC@Interfaces systems
has been developed to approach the temperature dependence of carrier
mobility. As a trial using the DCy-NDI-based MIS device,
the obtained Ninj–ΔNμ plot from 210 to 300 K indicated a slightly positive
correlation between temperature and electron mobility with a small
activation energy of ∼60 meV (Figure S4). This observation implies that the local-scale electron conduction
at the DCy-NDI/PMMA interface relies principally on a
hopping-like mechanism, though there is a large electron mobility
of ∼10 cm2 V–1 s–1.26

Evaluation of Electron
Mobility for DCy-PDI and DC8-PDI in an Ambient Atmosphere
To screen
a series of n-type materials for TRMC@interfaces, DCy-PDI MIS devices were investigated under an identical vapor-deposition
condition to that of DCy-NDI. The proposed core-size
effect,27 where a larger π-system
is favorable for intermolecular charge transport in view of Marcus
theory, was another important interesting subject by studying extended
π-conjugated materials with the present TRMC technique probing
local-scale charge carrier motions. However, the microwave response
was very small for the DCy-PDI MIS device (Figure 3a), and it is difficult to
distinguish with noise signals. In fact, mobility evaluation is not
possible from the Ninj–ΔNμ plot (Figure 3c). The observation of film morphology and measurement
of packing structure indicated that the DCy-PDI film
formed a different packing structure from the reported crystalline
phase.28 One of the striking features in
the observed XRD pattern was the lamellar periodicity of d′001 = 28.9 Å that was far larger than the
reported axes (Figure 3e).27 It is probably because PDI cores
have a strong intermolecular π–π interaction and
thus are trapped to form a kinetically stabilized structure at the
PMMA surface at room temperature (r.t.). With this hypothesis, a new
MIS device was fabricated by controlling the substrate temperature
(Tsub) at 80 °C during the vapor
deposition. Then, a set of sharp diffraction peaks was observed (Figure 3f), where the spacing
of d001 = 18.4 Å corresponds to one
of the reported lattices.28 Moreover, AFM
images disclosed that the crystalline grains of the DCy-PDI surface (Figure 3h) were highly developed with Tsub =
80 °C rather than the case with Tsub = r.t. As a consequence, a small but significant increase in the
microwave response was observed (Figure 3b). The estimated electron mobility by TRMC@interfaces is μe = 0.2 cm2 V–1 s–1 (Figure 3d).

Another PDI derivative, DC8-PDI, was examined in a similar way by preparing
two
types of MIS devices with Tsub = r.t.
and 80 °C. As the π–π stacking tendency was
more obvious for this system, drastic difference in TRMC@interfaces measurements was confirmed. However, in this case, we concluded
that the difference originated from the uniformity of the films that
determine the sufficient/insufficient injection of electrons at the
PMMA–DC8-PDI interface. In the case of Tsub = r.t.,
an estimated electron mobility of μe = 0.9 cm2 V–1 s–1 was recorded
(Figure 4a). Although
the obtained weak diffraction peaks in XRD were likely assigned to
a reported crystalline packing (Figure 4c),29,30 AFM observation revealed that
the semiconductor layer was composed of nonuniform aggregates (Figure 4e) probably due to
the very strong π–π interactions. On the assumption
of the homogeneous distribution of charges accumulated at the PMMA–DC8-PDI and Au–PMMA
interfaces, the calculated mobility is presumed to be underestimated.
In contrast, for the MIS device with Tsub = 80 °C, a uniform polycrystalline film was given (Figure 4d,f), leading to
the local-scale electron mobility of μe = 15 cm2 V–1 s–1 (Figure 4b).

Spatial Size of Mobile Charge Carriers and Structure–Mobility
Correlations
On the basis of Kubo’s equation derived
from the Einstein–Smoluchowski relation31 3  the spatial
size (Δx) of statistical local motion of charge
carriers was estimated during
the turn-over period of the electric field of the 9 GHz microwave
(see the Supporting Information in detail).
As summarized in Table 1, the Δx values range from 5 to 66 nm, all
of which appear much smaller than the crystalline grain size, judging
from the corresponding AFM images (Table S1). Therefore, the evaluated mobility dominantly reflects the intragrain
charge carrier motions at semiconductor–insulator interfaces.

The relationship
between local-scale structure and property can
be discussed on the basis of the XRD patterns and charge carrier mobility
evaluated by TRMC@interfaces. It is considered that
the observed difference between the local-scale electron mobilities
of DCy-PDI and DC8-PDI is dominantly due to the dimensionality of the
electron transport pathways. DC8-PDIs adopt a herringbone structure29,30 that enables two-dimensional conductive routes parallel to the direction
of the electric field of the microwave, whereas electron transport
pathways of DCy-PDIs align linearly28 parallel to the electric field. Even in the local area
probed by the present TRMC@interfaces method, thermal
fluctuations at r.t. may disturb the one-dimensional conductive pathways
of charge carriers, whereas the two-dimensional conductive network
is less affected.

Conclusions
As exemplified by the
simple MIS devices containing a series of
arylenediimide derivatives, we demonstrated the evaluation of local-scale,
intrinsic electron mobility at insulator–semiconductor interfaces
even in an ambient atmosphere. The estimated mobility values reflect
nanometer-scale motion of the injected charge carriers at the interface.
In fact, the mobility values are mostly larger than those reported
for FET devices and comparable with the highest ones reported so far,
suggesting the benchmark charge carrier mobilities of target semiconducting
materials. We believed that the present TRMC@Interfaces method serves as a rapid screening technique as well as a useful
tool to discuss the relationship among the local-scale charge carrier
mobility, thin-film morphology, and packing structure of organic semiconductors.

Experimental
Section
Fabrication of MIS Devices
The MIS devices used in
this study were fabricated as follows: (1) A quartz substrate (4.9
× 50 mm2, 1 mm thick) was treated with UV–O3 before use; (2) Ti (adhesion layer, 5 nm) and Au (gate electrode,
30 nm) layers were successively deposited on the quartz substrate
by direct-current sputtering and thermal vacuum deposition, respectively;
(3) As insulating layers, a 300 nm-thick SiO2 layer was
deposited by radio-frequency sputtering, and a 250 nm-thick PMMA (Aldrich)
layer was deposited by spin-coating from a 3 wt % PMMA solution in
toluene; (4) Thermal annealing was carried out at 100 °C for
1 h to remove residual solvent; (5) DCy-NDI, DC8-PDI, or DCy-PDI (Figure 1a), of 30–50
nm thickness, was thermally evaporated at a rate of 0.03 nm s–1 under 2 × 10–4 Pa; (6) A 30
nm-thick top Au electrode was deposited by vacuum deposition.

TRMC@Interfaces Measurements
The microwave
circuit was constructed using a waveguide system with a homodyne setup,
as described in Figure 1b and our previous report.13 The TRMC@Interfaces measurements were carried out using a microwave
at 9 GHz from a signal generator (SMF 100A; Rohde & Schwarz).
After the MIS device was loaded in the microwave cavity, a pulse gate
bias voltage Vg(t) at an interval of 50
ms was applied based on a multifunction generator (WF 1973; NF Corporation).
The current injected into the semiconductor–insulator interface I(t) was monitored using a digital phosphor oscilloscope (MDO 3022;
Tektronix). Simultaneously, the reflected microwave Pr(t) is first amplified with a high gain
FET amplifier (Gain 30 dB, 8–12 GHz; Ciao CA812-304), then
picked up by a Schottky diode, and monitored by the oscilloscope.
All experiments were conducted under ambient atmosphere at r.t.

Characterization of Semiconducting Layers
The morphology
of semiconducting layers was characterized by a tapping-mode atomic
force microscope (SPI-4000, Nanonavi II; SII NanoTechnology) using
silicon cantilevers with a frequency of 150 kHz and spring constant
of 9 N/m (OMCL-AC200TS-R3; OLYMPUS). The molecular packing of semiconducting
layers was analyzed by XRD measurements using an X-ray diffractometer
(λ = 1.54 Å, MiniFlex600; Rigaku) with a semiconductor
detector (D/teX Ultra; Rigaku).

DCMs
Triangle
voltage was applied to the MIS devices
by a function generator (WF 1973; NF Corporation) equipped with a
voltage amplifier. Transient current Idis(t) was picked up by a 30 kΩ terminal resistor
serially connected to the MIS device and monitored by a digital oscilloscope
(MDO 3022; Tektronix). On the basis of the following equation, the
capacitance values were calculated. 4
