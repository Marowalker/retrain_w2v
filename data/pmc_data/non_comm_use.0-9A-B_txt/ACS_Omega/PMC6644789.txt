We report herein
a precise control of the electrochemical bistability
induced by surface area changes during the cathodic deposition of
copper. Small additions of 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) in the reaction
media present an inhibiting effect on the global rate mainly due to
the adsorption of protonated Phen. The increase of its concentration
favors a shrinkage of the bifurcation (saddle-node) diagram and shifts
it to less negative potentials. The dynamic instability is verified
by impedance measurements, and a negative impedance is clearly found.
We calculated the apparent molar mass of the adsorbents using in situ
gravimetric monitoring in the electrochemical experiments, and the
results indicate that mass changes occur mainly due to the reduction
of copper from bivalent ions dissolved in the reaction media. Importantly,
the adsorption of protonated Phen molecules does not show a considerable
contribution in mass variations but prevents the formation of a copper
course grained morphology over the surface. Imaging analysis indicates
finer nodulations at the lower branch compared to the upper branch
in the bistability domain. On the basis of these observations, a kinetic
mechanism is proposed and a good agreement is obtained between the
apparent molar mass extracted from experiments and the theoretical
values. Altogether, our results contribute to a detailed physical
chemical description of the nonlinear behavior, bringing new insights
about this reaction and pointing out the possibility to design switchable
surface electrodes by taking advantage of the bistable behavior.

Introduction
Nonlinear behavior
in chemical systems far from equilibrium may
appear in the form of dynamic instabilities.1,2 One
very frequently observed is the bistability (BS) (i.e., two stable
steady states at the same set of controlling parameters), induced
by a saddle-node bifurcation,3 when positive
feedback loops act as regulatory steps in the overall mechanism.4 As a result of these self-amplifying processes,
a hysteretic profile arises, and consequently, chemical switches can
be designed and finely tuned by the imposition of external perturbations.5−9 For spatially extended systems, the appearance of collective switching
between states has been based on the bistable nature of the individuals,10−13 but it can also emerge from collective behavior even if the constituents
are not bistable.14 This co-existence of
different steady states has been verified in homogeneous15−19 and heterogeneous systems.20−22

Electrochemical instabilities
occur by the interaction of chemical
properties of the solid/liquid interface (faradaic impedance) with
electrical parameters of the equivalent circuit (applied voltage,
current, and resistance),23 resulting in
the formation of the so-called negative differential resistance (NDR).24 According to Koper,25 this condition is satisfied when an increase of the double layer
potential promotes a decrease of the available electrode area, the
electrochemical rate constant, or the interfacial concentration of
the electroactive species. Examples attending to the three cases have
been reported in the literature.26 Then,
in the presence of the NDR, BS arises mainly due to the electrical
autocatalysis in the electrode potential as the essential positive
feedback variable [N-shaped NDR (N-NDR)]27,28 or by chemical autocatalysis stemming from a reaction intermediate
[S-shaped NDR (S-NDR)].29,30

The emergence
of BS has been observed in different electrochemical
systems, such as the electroreduction of complexes of Ni(II) at a
streaming mercury electrode,31−34 in the electroreduction Hg(I)/Hg(II) ions coupled
with convection,35 in the anodic dissolution
of V electrodes in acidic media,36,37 in the electro-oxidation
of small organic molecules,38−40 and so forth. Overall, oscillations
appear along with BS depending on the controlling parameters. It reveals
a close correspondence between both nonlinear behaviors and corroborates
with the cross-shaped phase diagram analysis.15,16 The confirmation of the BS in these systems, under potentiostatic
control, for instance, can be confirmed by impedance measurements
in which zero imaginary impedance occurs in zero frequency of perturbation.41 Although, detecting more than two branches in
electrochemical systems are very rare, tristability has been observed
as well.33,42−44

Considering the
requirements to obtain a NDR, Nakanishi et al.45 have demonstrated that additions of small amounts
of 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) in the cathodic deposition of Cu can
easily induce potential and current oscillations. This study extended
the previous work of Schlitter et al.46 by a proposal of a mechanism for the electrochemical oscillations,
and in short, the autocatalytic variable was recognized as the effective
area of the electrode surface. To the best of our knowledge, these
are the only two papers dedicated to investigate dynamic instabilities
in this system. Furthermore, a more detailed study devoted to a deep
understanding of the kinetics underlying the nonlinear behavior is
of great interest, particularly due to the possibility to control
electrochemical switches based on surface modifications.

Herein,
we report the presence of BS in the electrodeposition of
Cu generated by the addition of Phen in the reaction media. Two different
surface deposits were observed in the same set of controlling parameters.
We interpreted this type of instability mechanistically with the aid
of the electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), the electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of the surface, contributing to a comprehensive physical chemical
description of the nonlinear behavior. These experimental results
open the possibility to design new chemical switches based on the
formation of micro- or nanostructured surfaces in which the surface
morphology would play an important role.

Experimental Section
The electrochemical experiments were carried out using a counter
electrode as a high area platinized-platinum foil, a reference electrode
as a reversible hydrogen electrode, and a working electrode (WE) as
a polycrystalline platinum sheet with an electrochemical area of 1.4
cm2 inferred by the charge in the hydrogen underpotential
deposition.47,48 In case of the EQCN measurements,
the WE was a disk-shaped quartz crystal 5 MHz AT cut, consisting of
a Au film evaporated over a thin Ti layer—Ti/Au polished with
a geometric area of 0.385 cm2. Frequencies of the quartz
were converted in mass variations by the Sauerbrey equation49 with −5.816 × 10–9 g Hz–1 as a constant. All glasses apparatus were
cleaned by the immersion in sulfonitric solution for 12 h followed
by exhaustive rinses and, at least, one boil with ultrapure water
(Milli-Q Millipore, 18.2 MΩ cm).

Before each cyclic voltammetry experiment,
the electrodes were cycled at 1.0 V s–1 between
0.05 and 1.50 V for about 500 times in order to assure a reproducible
surface structure. The cleanliness of the apparatus was checked from
successive cyclic voltammograms at 0.05 V s–1 until
the characteristic voltammetric profile for the polycrystalline Pt
electrode was observed. The supporting electrolyte was prepared by
H2SO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 95–98%) and CuSO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98%) solutions using ultrapure water
with final concentrations of 0.5 mol L–1. The surface
inhibition was caused by the addition of Phen (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%)
in the reaction media.

Before the experiments, the electrolyte
was kept in an ultrasonic
bath for, at least, 10 min in order to obtain a better dissolution
of Phen and was purged for 15 min with molecular nitrogen (White Martins,
99.99%) to remove oxygen. The electrochemical system was controlled
with a potentiostat (Autolab/Eco-Chemie, PGSTAT302N) equipped with
SCAN250, FRA32M, and EQCN modules. EIS was conducted at steady state
with a sinusoidal potential perturbation in the frequency range of
50 kHz to 0.5 mHz and an amplitude of ±10 mV. Surface images
were obtained by SEM (JEOL, JSM-6360LV), operating at 20 kV. All experiments
were carried out at room temperature.

Results and Discussion
Electrochemical
Experiments
Figure 1 depicts cyclic voltammetries at slow sweep
rates of dE/dt = 0.01 V s–1 of copper sulfate in sulfuric acid solution with a final concentration
of 0.5 mol L–1 for each reagent. The potential window
is 0.05–1.30 V (Figure 1a), −0.10 to 0.30 V (Figure 1b, black line), and, after the addition of
2.0 mmol L–1 of Phen, −0.10 to 0.30 V (Figure 1b, red line). The
electrodeposition of Cu is a well-known reaction studied along several
decades.50−55 As already reported in an acidic media,52 the reduction of Cu starts around 0.30 V, following an instantaneous
nucleation mechanism at very first stage of the faradaic reaction
for higher concentrations of copper (e.g., 0.025 and 0.05 mol L–1). The current density reaches −20 mA cm–2 at 0.05 V and still shows negative values of currents
up to the crossover potential of 0.30 V. From this potential, in the
positive direction, it is possible to observe an intense current density
peak of 32 mA cm–2 at 0.55 V, corresponding to the
oxidation of the Cu deposits and, in sequence, falling down to zero
current. For E > 0.62 V, Cu dissolution and a
surface
passivation occur.

Figure 1 Cyclic voltammograms of the Pt|H2SO4,CuSO4 system at dE/dt = 0.01
V s–1 in the potential window: (a) 0.05–1.30
and (b) −0.10 to 0.30 V (black line); same as item (b) but
with addition of 2.0 mmol L–1 of Phen (red line).
SSI: steady state I; SSII: steady state II; and BS: bistability. [H2SO4] = 0.5 mol L–1 and [CuSO4] = 0.5 mol L–1.

Focusing on the potential interval of −0.10 to 0.30
V (Figure 1b), the
electrodeposition
of Cu takes place continuously (black line) with a small hysteresis
along the positive and negative sweeps. There is a mean separation
of 1.9 mA cm–2 between the curves. However, when
Phen molecules are added in the electrolyte, with a final concentration
of 2.0 mmol L–1 (red line), the deposition process
is substantially suppressed for E < 0.15 V. This
inhibition reached a minimum value of −5.21 mA cm–2 at 0.1 V and produced a noteworthy separation of 8.6 mA cm–2 between the current curves along the both directions of the sweeps
in the interval of 0.03–0.15 V. The suppression is more pronounced
below 0.03 V, but it manifests slightly above 0.15 V as well. Nakanishi
et al.45 have postulated that adsorbed
metallic complexes [Cu(I)(Phen)2]2+(ad) could be mainly responsible for the inhibition and the formation
of the NDR. Overall, for E < 0.03 V and E > 0.15 V, the hysteresis is so small that can be considered
negligible. Accordingly, we considered a BS domain around the interval
of 0.03 V < E < 0.15 V and two steady states
regions, one at E > 0.15 V (SSI: steady state
I)
and another at E < 0.03 V (SSII: steady state
II).

At this point, the experimental conditions where BS can
be found
were, definitely, well determined. This knowledge allowed a safe variation
in the controlling parameters without get too far from the BS domain. Figure 2 shows the dependence
of the upper and lower potential limits of the BS by the change of
the external resistance (Rext) connected
in series to the WE (Figure 2a–d) at Phen = 2.0 mmol L–1 and the
variation of concentration of Phen in the reaction media (Figure 2e–h) at Rext = 28 Ω cm2. All mapping
experiments were conducted in low sweep rates of dE/dt = 0.01 V s–1. Similar observations
were done using slow rates in the cyclic voltammetries by Orlik et
al.37 Both concentration and external resistance
are considered as experimentally accessible controlling parameters
in electrochemical systems and can induce dynamic instabilities by
subtle changes.24

Figure 2 Cyclic voltammograms
at dE/dt = 0.01 V s–1 under different external resistances
at Phen = 2.0 mmol L–1 and Rext = (a) 7, (b) 14, (c) 21, and (d) 28 Ω cm2 and under the effect of the concentration of Phen at Rext = 28 Ω cm2 and Phen = (e) 0.5, (f)
1.0, (g) 1.5, and (h) 2.0 mmol L–1.

The increase of Rext is followed by
a progressive increase on the BS domain and it is also accompanied
by a pronounced shift to negative potentials, as verified in Figure 2a–d. For external
resistances of 7, 14, 21, and 28 Ω cm2, the difference
between the upper and lower potential limits of the BS was found to
be 0.10, 0.16, 0.21, and 0.26 V, respectively (we adopted the turning
points in the j vs E curves for
the calculation). These regions do not depend on the vertex potentials
in the cyclic voltammetries (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Indeed, the process that results
in the abrupt current changes and generates the BS seems to occur
in particular potentials values. This is a strong indicative that
the adsorption of the inhibiting species happens in those specific
potentials and remains on the surface, desorbing completely later
on in the reverse cycle.

On the other hand, the increase of
the concentration of Phen resulted
in a shrinkage of the BS domain. At the lowest employed concentration
of Phen, that is, 0.5 mmol L–1, only the lower limit
is observed and an expressive hysteretic profile does not arise (Figure 2e). When the concentration
of Phen is increased to 1.0 mmol L–1 a different
scenario appears and the BS is clearly established under these conditions
(Figure 2f). Note that
the approximation of the upper and lower limits to an invariable potential
became even more evident in larger concentrations of Phen, that is,
1.5 or 2.0 mmol L–1 (Figure 2g–h). No significant changes were
observed in these two concentrations, which indicate a surface saturation
of the inhibiting species above of 1.5 mmol L–1.

A summary of the effect of Rext and
concentration of Phen on the bistable behavior in the electrodeposition
of Cu is shown in terms of a bifurcation diagram in Figure 3. At first glance, its shape
has a considerable resemblance with the bifurcation diagrams of systems
belonging to an N-NDR category.26 In fact,
Nakanishi et al.45 have observed electrochemical
oscillations in both current and potential, which is a good indicative
that the cathodic deposition of Cu perturbed with Phen remains in
the hidden N-NDR (HN-NDR) subsystem. H means that the NDR can be partially
hidden from an intermediate that blocks the surface and reduces the
global rate in lower potentials.23,24

Figure 3 Bifurcation
diagram Rext vs E measured
at sweep rate of dE/dt = 0.01 V
s–1 in several concentrations
of Phen: 0.5 mmol L–1 (green line), 1.0 mmol L–1 (blue line), and 2.0 mmol L–1 (red
line). SSI: steady state I; SSII: steady state II; and BS: bistability.

Additionally, Figure 3 highlights the saddle-node
bifurcation3 as the lines surrounding the
domains of the BS and how it is strongly
modified by the increase of the concentration of Phen. A straight
green line represents the slight suppression of the current when [Phen]
= 0.5 mmol L–1 is added into the electrolyte. The
contraction of the BS domains reaches a maximum around 1.5 mmol L–1, and negligible changes are observed when compared
to the domain formed at 2.0 mmol L–1 (Figures 2g,h and S2 in the Supporting Information). The calculated areas
of these diagrams are 7.9 and 6.3 V Ω cm2 for 1.0
and 2.0 mmol L–1 of Phen, respectively. This compression
in the bifurcation diagram by inhibiting species is in agreement with
the numerical simulations performed by Nascimento et al.56 A considerable shrinkage of the Hopf domain
was observed as the irreversible surface poisoning evolved. The dynamics
changed accordingly and the chaotic oscillations were dramatically
suppressed.

The saddle-node bifurcation can be confirmed by
the EIS under potentiostatic
control when the imaginary part of the impedance is zero as the frequency
of perturbation tends to zero as well,41 that is, Z′(ω) = 0 for ω = 0. Figure 4 depicts Nyquist
plots of the electrodeposition of Cu in three different applied voltages
of 0.24, 0.12, and −0.05 V which are located at the SSI, the
BS domain, and the SSII, respectively. Black lines indicate the cathodic
reduction of Cu without the presence of Phen, whereas in red lines,
Phen is present in the reaction media. We modeled the frequency responses
by equivalent circuits for the impedances shown in Figure 4a,c and extracted the respective
electrical parameters (Figure S3 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Nyquist plots for the electroreduction
of Cu without (black lines)
and with (red lines) Phen molecules in the concentration of 2.0 mmol
L–1 at the applied voltages: (a) E = 0.24 V, (b) E = 0.12 V, and (c) E = −0.05 V. The insets correspond to a “zoom in”
on the plates (a–c). Sinusoidal amplitude of perturbation is
±10 mV from 50 kHz to 0.5 mHz.

Figure 4a
shows
that the process has distinct time scales with the presence of two
semicircles, one at higher and another at lower frequencies. They
are related to two limiting steps which compete simultaneously and
are affected by the applied voltage—high frequencies describe
activation control, whereas low frequencies describe mass transport
control.57 In the latter, the Warburg impedance
shows a decreasing imaginary component, resulting in the observed
trend58 (Figure 4a, black line). It has been also ascribed
that low-frequency loops are strongly dependent of the growth mode
of copper deposits.59,60 There are different interpretations
for the inductive behavior in the lowest frequencies, but it can represent
the adsorption–desorption of inhibiting species, for example,
anions from the electrolyte61 or a nucleation
process59,60 (Figure 4a, black line). The Ohmic drop (RΩ) shows very low values of around 2.2 Ω cm2 in all experiments.

Interestingly, the first semicircle
is not affected by the presence
of the Phen but causes a significant increase in the real and imaginary
components of the low-frequency loop (Figure 4a, red line). As the dominant loop belongs
to the higher frequency spectrum, the global faradaic reaction is
not highly affected by the Phen molecules under the voltage of 0.24
V. Figure 1b reflects
that this description where no significant suppression is observed
and similar charge transfer resistances (Rct) of 10 Ω cm2, with and without the presence of
Phen, corroborates with this scenario. Nevertheless, there is a slight
increase in the constant phase element from 21.4 to 29.9 μF
cm–2. For the second process located in lower frequencies,
the polarization resistance increases from 2.1 to 8.4 Ω cm2, reflecting the surface inhibiting effect of the Phen (Figure 4a, red line).

The dynamic instability induced by Phen becomes even clearer in
the Figure 4b. The
first observation is the anticlockwise movement in lower frequencies
on the Nyquist plot and the subsequent intersection in the real axis
at 1.5 mHz which is related to the Hopf bifurcation, that is, Z′(ω) = 0 for ω ≠ 0 (Figure 4b, red line). In
fact, the hidden negative impedance [Z′(ω)
< 0 for ω ≠ 0] suggests that the system belongs to
the HN-NDR class41 and consequently confirms
the proposition already discussed.45 Accordingly,
the autocatalytic evolution of the double layer potential is driven
by surface area changes, which makes a very easy handling of the BS
domain by the control of the concentration of Phen.

Figure 4c depicts
an expressive decrease of the diameter of the high-frequency loop
because of the fast charge transfer of the copper ions on the surface.
Indeed, the lowest resistance of Rct =
1.62 Ω cm2 is observed for this process (Figure 4c, black line) and
larger faradaic rates are in agreement with it (Figure 1b, black line). As also expected, a mass
transport limitation acts in this applied voltage and bigger semicircles
can be observed in lower frequencies.61 However, we believe that the presence of Phen has a strong effect
on the Cu deposits growth and the low-frequency loop is mainly attributed
to the inhibition of the surface by the adsorption of metallic complexes
(Figure 4c, red line),
having Phen as ligands, which induces the decrease of the overall
current (Figure 1b,
red line). The imaginary components showed an evident capacitive effect
of 390–687 mF cm–2 when Phen is added into
the reaction media.

Gravimetric Monitoring
In this section,
we will provide
further insights on the nature of the adsorbed species and it will
allow us to propose a mechanistic interpretation of how BS appears
in this system. Figure 5 shows the j vs E curves (dashed
line) during the electroreduction of Cu at dE/dt = 0.02 V s–1 followed by the corresponding
mass changes profiles (full lines) obtained with the aid of the EQCN.
The system was perturbed with small additions of Phen as final concentrations
of 0 (black), 0.5 mmol L–1 (green), 1.0 mmol L–1 (blue), and 2.0 mmol L–1 (red).
To study the BS domains by mass variation measurements (Δm), the limit potentials were set at 0–1.0 V in order
to prevent the continuous accumulation of Cu on the surface by its
dissolution in higher potentials and, then, preventing a monotonic
ascending curve of Δm. For this reason, the
mass changes profiles were normalized to zero at E = 1.0 V.

Figure 5 Current densities (dashed line) and mass variations (full line)
at dE/dt = 0.02 V s–1 with additions of Phen as final concentrations of (a) 0 (black),
(b) 0.5 mmol L–1 (green), (c) 1.0 mmol L–1 (blue), and (d) 2.0 mmol L–1 (red). [H2SO4] = 0.5 mol L–1 and [CuSO4] = 0.5 mol L–1.

As observed in Figure 5 the crossover potential is 0.3 V but a significant deposition
of Cu occurs only for E < 0.26 V and begins to
decay around E > 0.35 V in the positive direction.
The removal of deposited Cu is dependent on the concentration of Phen.
As it increases, the suppression of the global rate can be evidenced
by the decrease of the oxidative and reductive currents followed by
the reduction of the corresponding mass changes profiles in the positive
and negative sweeps, respectively. Interestingly, an expressive variation
of the mass can be observed in the lower and upper potential limits
of the BS domains, where the curve Δm vs E flips the concavity and bends, forming a considerable
angle especially at higher concentrations of Phen. This observation
suggests that there is a strong adsorption of species dissolved in
the electrolyte during the negative sweep. This abrupt current suppression
is detailed in Figure 6. When it is turned to positive direction, the adsorbed species are
released from the surface and the Cu deposition occurs quicker.

Figure 6 (a–d) j vs E and (e–h)
Δm vs q in the potential interval
of 0–0.20 V. The arrows indicate the direction of the sweep.
The curves follow the color code used in the text for Phen concentrations:
0 (black), 0.5 mmol L–1 (green), 1.0 mmol L–1 (blue), and 2.0 mmol L–1 (red).
The gray bands represent the potential window, where mass/charge ratios
were calculated.

Focusing on the potential
interval of 0–0.20 V, it was possible
to calculate the mass/charge (m/z) ratios from j vs E and Δm vs E curves in the negative sweep as
represented by the arrows. The colors assignments are the same of
the Figure 5. The experimental m/z ratio for the electrodeposition of
Cu without the presence of Phen (Figure 6a,e) is 332 μg C–1, which agrees with the theoretical value of 329 μg C–1 and retracts the electroreduction of Cu2+ to Cu0 on the surface. In this calculation, we used the molar mass of 63.5
g mol–1 for Cu and 2 electrons for the faradaic
reaction, that is, 63.5 g mol–1/2 × 96 485
C mol–1. As long as the Phen concentration increases,
the m/z values increases as well.
In this respect, we can safely consider that the process attributed
to the adsorption, responsible to generate the instability in the
negative sweep, takes place more intensely following the ascending
order: [Phen] = 0.5 mmol L–1 and 352 μg C–1 (Figure 6b,f), [Phen] = 1.0 mmol L–1 and 392 μg
C–1 (Figure 6c,g), and [Phen] = 2.0 mmol L–1 and 416
μg C–1 (Figure 6d,h). The effect of adsorption of protonated Phen was
studied separately, vide Figure 7.

Figure 7 (a) j vs E, (b) Δm vs E, and (c) Δm vs q in the potential interval of 0–0.20
V in the absence of copper sulfate. The curves follow the color code
used as previously: 0.5 mmol L–1 (green), 1.0 mmol
L–1 (blue), and 2.0 mmol L–1 (red).
[H2SO4] = 0.5 mol L–1.

Nakanishi et al.45 have postulated that
the reduced form of the adsorbed metallic complexes [Cu(I)(Phen)2]2+(ad) could be the responsible for
the inhibition effect, but it was observed mainly in neutral media.62 In acidic environment, the ligands could be
totally protonated, which would weaken the coordination bonds between
Cu2+ and Phen and, therefore, generate uncoordinated ligands
molecules. According to this description, Phen might also participate
in the adsorption process causing the inhibition effect simultaneously
with the adsorption of the metallic complexes.63Figure 7a depicts cyclic voltammograms of the system Cu|H2SO4,Phen under different concentrations of Phen. In this potential
region, there is no Cu dissolution (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) and the anodic and cathodic currents
can be associated with desorption and adsorption processes, respectively.
Large currents are observed in higher concentrations of Phen.

Figure 7b shows
that the respective mass profiles corroborate with the processes discussed
previously. Note, however, that the mass scale is now in nanograms.
In the positive sweep, the mass variations decrease for E > 0.17 V and increase in the negative sweep starting at E < 0.19 V. In this respect, one can conclude that in
NDR region observed during copper electrodeposition, the Phen molecules
(or their protonated form) interact with the surface competing for
adsorption sites. We have tried to explain the nature of Phen adsorbate
by m/z ratios in the potential interval
of 0.07–0.15 V, cf. Figure 7c. Straight lines with a good fit were obtained and
correspond to 166 μg C–1 (green line), 170
μg C–1 (blue line), and 181 μg C–1 (red line).

As observed, these values do not
show big discrepancies between
each other and are approximately 10 times lower than those expected
to the Phen adsorption in a one-electron process, thus suggesting
unknown charge transfer processes occurring simultaneously at this
potential window (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). In certain extension, the adsorption of protonated
Phen can be considered a fast equilibrium with the dissolved molecules
in the interface, which modifies the total coverage of the adsorbed
species and ends up with underestimated values of m/z. In the next sections, we will provide a more
realistic information, or physical sense, by converting m/z ratios in apparent molar mass and, finally, propose
a kinetic mechanism to the emergence of the BS.

Imaging Analysis
Corroborating with the previous measurements,
this section will support the overall discussion by extracting surface
images with the aid of the SEM. Nakanishi et al.45 have inspected the electrodeposit surface and observed
two types of surface morphologies during the electrochemical oscillations:
leaflet-like particles of a few micrometers in size and dense round-shaped
leaflets, which are associated with low and high current states, respectively.
Cu leaflets would occur in an anisotropic crystal growth by a selective
adsorption on a specific crystalline facet inhibiting the global reaction.
Interestingly, in a bistable state, the addition of Phen resulted
in a completely different morphology, reflecting the emergence of
structured surfaces driven by distinct dynamic instabilities.

Figure 8 depicts SEM
images of the surface at three applied voltages: 0.24 V (SSI), 0.12
V [bistability, upper (BSu) and lower (BSd)
branches, and −0.05 V (SSII)]. For each experiment, we cycled
20 times between −0.1 and 0.3 V at dE/dt = 0.01 V s–1, pulled out the WE in the
desired voltage and sequentially disconnected it from the potentiostat.
This procedure assured a good reproducibility. The images show that
the surface morphology of the electroplated deposit depends on the
applied voltage and the presence of Phen in the reaction media. Regarding
the SSI, in the potential region, where Phen alters slightly the current
density (Figure 1b),
a fine globular structure is clearly seen. As the potential slowly
decreases, this fine structure moves toward a roundish nodule morphology,
vide BSd. Then, after the abrupt suppression of the current
by the adsorption of reaction intermediates, the system reaches a
state where massive deposition of Cu takes place.

Figure 8 Electronic micrographs
of the electrode surface after the electrodeposition
of Cu perturbed with 2.0 mmol L–1 of Phen. The samples
were obtained at the potentials of 0.24 V (SSI), 0.12 V (BSu and BSd as the upper and lower branches of the BS domain,
respectively), and −0.05 V (SSII). The diameter of the images
is 9 μm.

The image taken in the
SSII represents this situation and evidences
the production of thick Cu films, which are coarse-grained and uniform
along the electrode. Similar observations have been reported in the
electrodeposition of copper.64,65 Finally, in the reverse
scan, the surface structure gradually changes to a finer globular
formation again as seen in BSu. However, this return is
not totally completed to the SSI state and visual differences are
observed in the images found at BSu and BSd.
Overall, the BSu surface structure has a lower number of
fine nodulations and embranchments compared to BSd. The
system is very sensitive to the initial conditions and, for this reason,
exhibits a memory effect. In fact, this characteristic is a strong
evidence of the presence of BS. According to the surface inhibition
provoked by the addition of Phen, these molecules seem to prevent
the formation of coarse grained structures because it demonstrates
a substantial inhibiting effect in the reaction of Cu deposition.

Mechanistic Interpretation
The initial voltammetric
characterization presented in Figure 1 attests the inhibition effect of the Phen in the electrodeposition
of Cu. In fact, it has been proposed that metallic complexes have
a strong adsorption on the surface, which reduce the total active
area.45 Phen molecules have also a favorable
interaction with metallic surfaces66−69 and can easily change its orientation
depending on the applied voltage.70,71 Therefore,
not only the metallic complexes could induce dynamic instabilities
but also the ligands by a significant adsorption process. Herein,
we provide mechanistic information about the effect of the blocking
species using a combination of surface techniques.

First, it
is important to consider that the reaction media, where the study
was conducted, is highly acidic with [H2SO4]
= 0.5 mol L–1 and [CuSO4] = 0.5 mol L–1 or pH → 0. As the pKa of the [H(Phen)]+ and [H(Phen)2]+ species are 5.12 and 2.11, respectively,72−74 the Phen molecules
are protonated in the nitrogen atoms. Hence, for pKa > pH, it is expected to observe the following reactions
in the bulk of the solution r1   r2  

For the sake of simplicity,
we neglected the contribution of the
[H(Phen)2]+(aq) species in the analysis,
although it has been also detected experimentally in a self-stacking
mechanism.75,76 Because copper sulfate is also
added into the electrochemical cell r3  which
shows an oxidized form of the metallic
complex as the dominant species in the solution. It is proposed that
it can adsorb on the surface and compete in parallel with the deposition
of Cu.

The electrochemical reduction of Cu in the solid/liquid
interface
takes place as r4  

This reaction proceeds through two steps, and the rate determinant
step is considered to be the first electron reception by the bivalent
ion.77 We write this reaction in a short
form r4. On the other hand, the electrons transfer
in the metallic complex happens in an adsorption pathway45 r5  in our electrochemical mechanism, asterisk
means free active sites on the surface. The nature of the adsorbed
complex is still not clear but experimental evidences in different
substrates, concentrations, and solution pH have shown to be [Cu(I)(Phen)2]+(ad).78−80 Nevertheless, in very
strong acidic media as ours, the protonation of the nitrogen in the
Phen molecules is energetically favorable. Because of the positively
charged reactants, the formation of the coordinated bonds is not easily
performed and a complex dissociation would occur as well. Naturally,
the formation of the NDR is severely dependent on the pH, being its
appearance facilitated when pH increases.45

This reaction intermediate has a short-lived state, and it
is rapidly
reduced to metallic Cu in lower potentials78,79 r6  Then, larger concentrations of Phen
result
in steeper slopes j vs E during
the inhibition process and a shift to less negative potentials. As
the dynamic equilibrium of the reaction r5 has
an impact on the total coverage of the adsorbed metallic complexes,
the mass variations would be associate mainly with the electrochemical
deposition of Cu (the reduction evolving a metallic complex should
shift the onset potential, but it is not verified in our experiments).
Although the concentration of Phen is much lower than Cu2+(aq), a fast equilibrium might be observed by those remaining
protonated molecules which are not coordinated with Cu r7  

We can now use the m/z ratios
and convert them to apparent molar mass (Mapp), considering the faradaic process. Figure 6 provides the following information in each
concentration of Phen: 352 μg C–1 (0.5 mmol
L–1), 392 μg C–1 (1.0 mmol
L–1), 416 μg C–1 (2.0 mmol
L–1). We already know the electroreduction of Cu2+ has a theoretical value of 329 μg C–1, and hence, the experimentally measured m/z ratios represent mostly the reaction r4. This observation is in agreement with the large difference between
the concentrations of copper sulfate and Phen in the reaction media
and the massive electrochemical deposition of Cu during the gravimetric
measurements. In this respect, the faradaic reactions r5–r7 participate
only with 23 μg C–1 (0.5 mmol L–1), 63 μg C–1 (1.0 mmol L–1), and 87 μg C–1 (2.0 mmol L–1) because of the discount of 329 μg C–1 from
the total value.

These m/z ratios are quite small,
and if the conversion is made for a 1 electron transfer reaction,
they can be associated with Mapp: 2.2,
6.1, and 8.4 g mol–1, respectively. The results
point out that none of the metallic complex intermediates, containing
Cu (63.5 g mol–1) or Phen (180.2 g mol–1), could be adsorbed on the surface because of their high molar mass.
Note that our model does not take in to account the participation
of water molecules and (bi)sulfate anions dissolved in the electrolyte,
and possibly, those small changes could be also related to it. Performing
the calculation using the derivative dΔm/dC vs E along 0–0.2 V (Figure S5
in the Supporting Information), it is possible
to obtain point-by-point the m/z ratios. Clearly, the reaction r4 is dominant
and takes place over the total interval of 0–0.2 V, and the m/z ratios slightly diverge from 329 μg
C–1 in the abrupt current suppressions shown in Figure 6.

On the basis
of these experimental results, we can conclude that
the adsorbed intermediates do not alter mass variations significantly
during the formation of the NDR but can inhibit the reduction of copper
ions and modify drastically the global faradaic reaction as observed
in Figures 1 and 5. It was found that Phen molecules are adsorbed
vertically on Cu(111) with their nitrogen atoms facing the substrate.71 The molecules were stacked to form polymer-like
chains because of the π-electron attraction in the aromatic
ring among them. The adlayer of Phen formed on Cu surface changes
depending on the applied voltage and it is considered more organized
in positive potentials. If the electrolyte is kept in acidic conditions,
the molecular plane of Phen is inclined toward the metal surface,66 which could further enhance the inhibition factor.

Our experimental results converge to the idea that the inhibiting
effect of the global faradaic reaction could be related with the adsorption
of Phen—the protonated Phen molecules coordinate with Cu2+ in a negligible extension because of the highly acidic media
(two positively charged reactants). Then, reactions r5 and r6 should not be present and the
equilibrium in the reaction r3 is definitely
shifted to the left. Additionally, the adsorption of protonated Phen
on the Cu surface might occur in a fast equilibrium with the molecules
on the interface, impacting on the total coverage of the adsorbed
species and resulting in underestimated values of m/z, vide Figures 6 and 7. It might be also considered
a weak adsorption driven possibly by physical interactions, which
does not contribute to meaningful mass variations, but still affects
the Faradaic reaction of the electrochemical reduction of Cu.

Conclusions
We have studied the effect of Phen in the electrochemical reduction
of Cu under strong acidic media by means of different surface techniques.
Overall, Phen molecules are found to be protonated and the coordination
with copper ions dissolved in the solution seems to be unfavorable.
The Phen molecules adsorb on the surface and inhibit the reduction
of Cu2+ from the solution. This blocking process alters
significantly the area of the electrode and induces an autocatalytic
evolution of the double layer potential. As experimentally observed,
this dynamic behavior promotes the formation of a bistable domain,
delineated by a saddle-node bifurcation, in a wide range of controlling
parameters, such as the external resistance, the applied voltage,
and the concentration of Phen.

The increase of the concentration
of Phen favors a shrinkage of
the bifurcation diagram and shifts it to less negative potentials.
Besides voltammetric characterization, the EIS measurements also converge
to a conclusion of an inhibiting process. The instability generated
by adsorption was confirmed by the hidden negative impedance, that
is, Z′(ω) < 0 for ω ≠
0, indicating a HN-NDR system. The EQCN experiments show that the
mass variations take place mainly by the electrodeposition of Cu from
the bivalent ions, and consequently, the adsorption of dissolved Phen
molecules does not show an important contribution in this respect.

A kinetic mechanism is proposed based on the observations, and
a good agreement is obtained between the apparent molar mass extracted
from experiments and the theoretical values. Surface images indicate
that Phen prevents the formation of coarse grained structures and
the BS domain is composed by two different surface morphologies—the
lower branch has finer nodulations compared to the upper branch. Finally,
we believe that our results can trigger the design of a switchable
surface electrodes taking advantage from the easy access to a bistable
behavior. A reversible change in the coverage of the Phen could turn
“on” or “off” two different surface states
multiple times.
