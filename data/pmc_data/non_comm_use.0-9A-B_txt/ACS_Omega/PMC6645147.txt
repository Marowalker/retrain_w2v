Highly stable fluorescent glutathione
(GSH)-protected AuAg assembly
has been synthesized in water under UV irradiation. The assembly is
composed of small Ag2/Ag3 clusters. These clusters
gain stability through synergistic interaction with Au(I) present
within the assembly. This makes the overall assembly fluorescent.
Here, GSH acts as a reducing as well as stabilizing agent. The assembly
is so robust that it can be vacuum-dried to solid particles. The as-obtained
solid is dispersible in nonaqueous solvents. The interaction between
solvent and the assembly provides stability to the assembly, and the
assembly shows fluorescence. It is interesting to see that the behavior
of long-chain aliphatic thiols or amines toward the fluorescent assembly
is altogether a different phenomenon in aqueous and nonaqueous mediums.
The assembly gets ruptured in water due to direct interaction with
long-chain thiols or amines, whereas in nonaqueous medium, solvation
of added thiols or amines becomes pronounced, which hinders the interaction
of solvent with the assembly. However, the fluorescence of the assembly
is always quenched with thiols or amines no matter what the solvent
medium is. In aqueous medium, the fluorescence quenching by aliphatic
thiol or amine becomes pronounced with successive decrease in their
chain length, whereas in nonaqueous medium, the trend is just reversed
with chain length. The reasons behind such an interesting reversal
of fluorescence quenching in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents have
been discussed explicitly. Again, in organic solvents, thiol or amine-induced
quenched fluorescence is selectively recovered by Pb(II) ion without
any alteration of excitation and emission maxima. This phenomenon
is not observed in water because of the ruptured fluorescent assembly.
The fluorescence recovery by Pb(II) and unaltered emission peak only
in nonaqueous solvent unequivocally prove the engagement of Pb(II)
with thiols or amines, which in turn revert the original solvent-supported
stabilization of the assembly.

Introduction
Fluorescent gold (Au)
and silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) have
created immense interest due to their optical properties and a wide
range of applications like sensing,1,2 biolabeling,3 and imaging.4 Generally,
metal nanoparticles of dimension <2 nm, categorized under clusters,
show molecule-like behavior.5,6 They possess discrete
energy states due to quantum confinement effects. These nanoparticles
lying within sub-2 nm dimension show excellent photoluminescence property.
However, the stability of the fluorescent particles especially for
Ag clusters has always been a matter of concern. The similarity of
dissociation energy with the excitation energy of Ag dimmers and the
tendency toward oxidation as well as spontaneous aggregation caused
problem for Ag clusters.7 Several strategies
have been adopted to stabilize fluorescent clusters. One of them is
the use of scaffolds, like amines, thiols, dendrimers, microemulsions,
polymers, DNA, etc. together with reducing agents in the chemical
reduction method.8−11 Another tactic is to apply the synergistic effect out of association
with other metals. Fluorescent bimetallic AuAg NPs of different compositions
are easy to synthesize in varied size regimes due to their similar
lattice constants and isomorphous structures.12 As bimetallic AuAg NPs possess high quantum yield, they circumvent
the usual weak fluorescence of the individual Ag or Au NPs. This intense
emission is the key factor for different applications. The synergistic
effect between Au and Ag stabilizes and enhances the fluorescence
of AuAg NPs if manipulated judiciously. This synergism shows a pronounced
effect on AuAg clusters (NC).13 Photophysical
and photochemical properties of fluorophores differ greatly depending
on the solvent polarity, refractive index, viscosity, etc.14 It is reported that the fluorescence intensity,
lifetime, and quantum yield of fluorescent clusters and core–shell
particles, e.g., Ag nanoclusters stabilized by poly(methyl methacrylate)/poly(methyl
methacrylate)–poly(methacrylic acid) core/shell nanoparticles
are improved in different organic solvents; however, the Stokes shift
remains unaltered.15 Zhou et al. reported
solvent-dependent photoluminescence properties of Au8 nanoclusters.16 For the fluorescing systems that contain metal
(0)–metal (I)–ligand structures, there are two possibilities
that either the fluorescence may arise from the metal (0) core or
metal (I)–ligand system.6 Initial
studies support for the charge and valence state of metal core-dependent
fluorescence of the moieties. However, the metal (I)–ligand
interactions are now considered as the contributing factors for the
strong interaction between metal and ligand. A high surface-to-volume
ratio has always been an important factor in this field of study.
It has been observed that the clusters with the same number of metal
atoms at the core but different protecting ligands show different
emission property. Yuan et al.17 have shown
that the use of different thiolated ligands (3-mercaptopropionic acid,
6-mercaptohexanoic acid, etc.) causes varied emissions from the Au25 cluster. The ligands with electron-rich functional groups
and electropositivity of the metal core promote the fluorescence property
of metal nanoclusters.6 Shang et al.18 have shown that for a fluorescent particle,
Au(0)Au(I) ligand, the presence of Au(I) is an important moiety for
fluorescence generation. Upon further reduction of the fluorescent
particle by a strong reducing agent, borohydride, they have observed
the decreased emission intensity. Again, Goswami et al.19 reported an aggregation-induced emission (AIE)
from such a Au(0)–Au(I)–glutathione nanocluster. Another
examlpe of the core–shell type fluorescent nanoparticle that
showed AIE was reported by Zhao et al.20 In this case, glutathione-protected Au(I) is the core and SiO2 acts as the shell. The fluorescence of the NPs has shown
to further increase with the incorporation of Cd(II) cations. However,
further research is going on to explore the reasons behind the fluorescence
of NPs of different morphologies.

In recent days, chemical-based
molecular logic gates have attracted
growing interest due to their fascinating significance in the development
of molecular-scale electronic devices. These perform Boolean logic
operations in response to chemical inputs. Different groups have reported
molecular logic gates by using materials, such as nucleic acids,21 proteins,22 and organic
molecules.23 There are certain methods,
like luminescence, colorimetry, electrochemistry, etc., that are used
in logic devices. However, photoluminescence is broadly considered
for high sensitivity and a simple and fast response.24 The molecular logic gates are implemented depending on
the sensing results (fluorescence turn off or turn on).

Here,
in this work, we have reported the synthesis of an intriguingly
fluorescent assembly from aqueous solution of glutathione (GSH), chloroauric
acid, and silver nitrate in a particular ratio under UV irradiation.
Again, the dried assembly, AuAgGSH, produced a stable dispersion in
organic solvents with increased emissive behavior. We presume that
electronic interactions between Ag(0) and Au(I) as well as Au(I) and
GSH are responsible for the stability and fluorescence of the assembly.
To prove this, we have performed a ligand exchange reaction and substituted
GSH with different aliphatic thiols and amine ligands. We took this
task as commercial aliphatic thiols and amines with different chain
lengths are readily available. There are some reports regarding the
effect of thiol ligands with different functionalities on the emission
behavior of fluorescent NPs6 and monolayer
formation on the metallic surface of a Ag/Cu bimetallic nanocluster.25 However, there is no report, as our knowledge
goes, on the effect of ligands with the same functional groups but
with varied chain lengths. To widen the studies on the ligand effect,
long-chain amines are also considered here for facile but competitive
amine–Ag interaction. During the ligand exchange process, we
have found that the solvent as well as ligand chain length provides
interesting results that relates to the stability of the as-synthesized
fluorescent assembly. Fluorescence of the assembly increases when
water is replaced by another solvent, but when long-chain amines or
thiols are added individually or simultaneously to the assembly, taken
in any solvent, the fluorescence is quenched. Here, we have discovered
that the quenching trend is dependent on the chain length as well
as the solvent, i.e., the dispersion medium. Interestingly, Pb(II)
is the only metal ion that has been found to increase the quenched
fluorescence of AuAgGSH in different organic solvents, whereas in
water, Pb(II) cannot rescue the quenched fluorescence caused by thiols
or amines. Capitalizing on this idea, IMPLICATION logic gates have
been proposed in nonaqueous medium only.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Instruments
All of the reagents were
of AR grade. Triple distilled water was employed throughout the experiment.
Chloroauric acid (HAuCl4), silver nitrate (AgNO3), glutathione (GSH), metal salts, long-chain thiol and amine compounds
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the solvents were purchased
from Merck. All glass wares were cleaned with freshly prepared aqua
regia, subsequently rinsed with distilled water, and dried well before
use.

All UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded in an
Evolution 201 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The absorbance
was measured using a glass cuvette. At room temperature (25 °C),
the fluorescence measurement was done with a Perkin-Elmer LS55 fluorescence
spectrometer. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured with Easy life
V (Optical Building Blocks Corporation) equipped with a 380 nm light-emitting
diode excitation source. A nonlinear least squares (χ2) fit was tested to determine the fit of the decay rate to a sum
of exponentials, and a visual inspection of the residuals and the
autocorrelation function were used to determine the quality of the
fit. The sample was taken in a quartz cuvette with a path length of
1 cm for fluorescence measurement. The VG Scientific ESCALAB MK II
spectrometer (U.K.) equipped with Mg Kα excitation source (1253.6
eV) and a five-channeltron detection system were used for X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The samples were fridge-dried before
XPS measurement. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were
done with an H-9000 NAR instrument (Hitachi) having an accelerating
voltage of 300 kV. The samples were drop-casted onto a carbon-coated
copper grid, and the grid was vacuum-dried before loading into the
microscope. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) spectroscopy was performed by a VOYAGER-DE PRO (manufactured
by Applied Biosystems). Sinapinic acid was used as the matrix during
drop casting of the sample for analysis. Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) of the liquid samples were done using a Thermo-Nicolet continuum
FTIR microscope. All of the experiments were repeated three times
at room temperature and almost neutral medium (pH = 6.9).

Synthesis of
the Fluorescent Assembly
The glutathione-mediated
Ag(0)Au(I) assembly was synthesized by irradiation of the mixture
of AgNO3, GSH, and HAuCl4 under UV light. Typically,
0.5 mL of 10–2 M HAuCl4 solution was
added to 8 mg of GSH, followed by 1.5 mg of AgNO3. The
mixture was mixed very well and dissolved into 15 mL of water. Then,
the colorless solution was subjected to UV (wavelength = 365 nm) irradiation
for 10 h. After 10 h, a yellow solution was obtained. This solution
showed fluorescence at 580 nm when excited at 390 nm. The as-synthesized
solution was vacuum-dried to obtain a yellow solid product.

The as-obtained yellow solid was dissolved in 15 mL of ethanol directly,
and the solution was also fluorescent (λex = 390
nm and λem = 580 nm). Dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium
salt (AOT, 0.5 mg) was dissolved in 15 mL of heptane, followed by
the as-synthesized yellow solid to attain complete dissolution of
the solid in n-heptane. This produced a fluorescent
solution (λex = 390 nm and λem =
574 nm).

Effect of Pb(II) on the Thiol or Amine Assembly in Different
Solvents
Thiol or amine solution (1.6 × 10–4 M) was added to 0.0132 mg/mL fluorescent assembly, and the final
volume was adjusted to 3 mL with solvent. This mixture was shaken
gently and kept at room temperature. After 24 h, the spectra were
measured.

To see the effect of Pb(II) on the fluorescence of
the solution, 1.6 × 10–4 M Pb(II) solution
was added to the thiol or amine-added solution of the assembly prepared
as per the above-mentioned method (thiol or amine concentration remained
1.6 × 10–4 M, and concentration of the assembly
remained 0.0132 mg/mL). The final volume of the solution was kept
at 3 mL. After 6 h of addition, the spectra were recorded.

Results
and Discussion
When aqueous mixture of glutathione (GSH)
and silver nitrate are
kept under ∼365 nm UV irradiation, it produces a feebly fluorescent
water miscible material (WAgGSH). Again, the mixture of chloroauric
acid and GSH, under UV light irradiation, does not produce a significantly
fluorescent product (WAuGSH) under the experimental conditions (Figure S1, Supporting Information). However,
addition of chloroauric acid to the mixture of GSH together with silver
nitrate, under UV irradiation for 10 h, generates highly fluorescent
material. The assembly in water is denoted as WAuAgGSH. Then, the
as-synthesized solution is dried under vacuum to obtain a yellow powder
(AuAgGSH) that readily dissolves in common organic solvents, like
ethanol, methanol, acetone, dimethyl formamide, etc. AuAgGSH can be
deliberately delivered into water miscible organic solvents, like
heptanes, toluene, etc., with the assistance of dioctyl sulfosuccinate
sodium salt (AOT). Here, GSH is used as both a reducing and stabilizing
agent. Under UV irradiation, GSH reduces Ag(I) to Ag(0) and then stabilizes
the Ag(0) particle. Dickson et al. have previously reported the synthesis
of fluorescent Ag clusters.26 However,
stability related issues have always been a concern as the Ag nanoclusters
are prone to aggregation and also the excitation energy of Ag clusters
is quite close to their dissociation energy.27 In the present case, Au(I), produced by GSH reduction, provides
stability to Ag(0) particles by withdrawing electron density from
Ag(0). Maretti et al.28 demonstrated that
the positive surface of Au(I) helps to stabilize Ag(0) nanoclusters.
This is a kind of synergism where the resultant fluorescence is much
enhanced than the sum of the fluorescence of the individual component.
Explicitly, GSH can reduce Au(III) to Au(I) and the synergistic effect
between Au(I) and Ag(0) makes the overall system stable as well as
highly fluorescent. The oxidized form of GSH remains as GSSG in the
system.29 The oxidation states of the species
are confirmed from XPS peaks. Peaks at 368.20 and 374.2 eV represent
binding energy for Ag(0) 3d5/2 and Ag(0) 3d3/2, respectively, and at 84.5 and 88.1 eV represents Au(I) 4f7/2 and Au(I) 4f5/2, respectively (Figure 1). From XPS, we find that Ag is in 0 oxidation
state and Au is in +1 oxidation state. The peak at 162.5 eV shows
the presence of S 2p3/2. Further deconvolution shows peaks
at 161.7 and 162.8 eV, indicating the presence of Ag–S–R-like
interaction30 and Au–S interaction,31 respectively (Figure S2, Supporting Information). In FTIR spectra, the absence of characteristic
−S–H band indicates M–S interaction (Figure S2, Supporting Information).32 Mass analysis is another important characterization
technique.33 We performed MALDI-TOF analysis
that shows the presence of Ag3 and Ag2 clusters
in the assembly (Figure S2, Supporting
Information). MALDI-TOF spectra suggests that Ag(0) and Au(I) collocate
on each other. Also, absorption spectra suggest the presence of Ag2/Ag3 moiety.34 A report
by Chakraborty et al.35 suggests that with
the increase in the number of atoms in the bimetallic cluster core,
the pronounced absorption peaks at the visible region increases. However,
the as-synthesized fluorescent assembly containing Ag(0) and Au(I)
does not show significant peak, indicating an insignificant plasmon
band of the overall moiety. Hence, Ag2/Ag3 clusters
were considered. Further investigation is warranted in this respect.
The emissive nature of Ag arises due to the transfer of electron density
from the submerged and quasicontinuum 5d band to the lowest unoccupied
conduction band of Ag clusters. This is a kind of an interband transition.27 Hence, the fluorescence comes from the Ag2/Ag3 cluster and these clusters are stabilized
through synergism with Au(I). WAuAgGSH shows fluorescence at 580 nm
upon excitation at 390 nm (Figure 1). The excitation peak arises at 391 nm (Figure S1, Supporting Information) corresponding
to emission at 580 nm, showing the appropriateness of the chosen excitation
wavelength. Another point to be noted is that the emission peak position
does not change to a great extent with respect to variation in excitation
wavelength (Figure S1, Supporting Information).
This may indicate that only one fluorescing species is present in
the system.36 Again, from the mass analysis
data, we have found that two types of Ag clusters are present in the
system. The emission peak is quite broad, indicating the fact that
overall emission is the overlapped emission from each species.37 The quantum yield (φ) value has been found
to be 4.98% when measured with respect to standard quinine sulfate
solution. WAuAgGSH particles do not possess any characteristic absorption
peak in the visible region (Figure 1D). WAuAgGSH particles possess an average lifetime
of 4.67 ns (Figure S3, Supporting Information).
The TEM image shows that the average particle dimension is ∼560
nm (Figure 1). Figure S4, Supporting Information shows the particle
size distribution plot.

Fluorescence of WAuAgGSH depends not only on the synergistic
collaboration
of Au(I) and Ag(0) species but also on the suitable stabilizing ligand,
GSH. An attempt of the ligand exchange process affects the stability
of the fluorescent moiety and causes quenching of fluorescence. Certain
long-chain aliphatic amine and thiol compounds are utilized in this
process thinking of the ease of interaction of thiols and amines with
Au and Ag moiety, respectively.38 The thiol
compounds used are 1-decanethiol [CH3(CH2)9SH], 1-dodecanethiol [CH3(CH2)11SH], 1-tetradecanethiol [CH3(CH2)13SH], and 1-hexadecanethiol [CH3(CH2)15SH], and the amines are 1-decylamine [CH3(CH2)9NH], 1-dodecylamine [CH3(CH2)11NH], 1-tetradecylamine [CH3(CH2)13NH], and 1-hexadecylamine [CH3(CH2)15NH]. When thiols (Figure 2A) and amines (Figure 2B) are added individually, the solution turns slightly
turbid with the increase in the chain length and the inherent fluorescence
of WAuAgGSH gets quenched (Figure S5, Supporting Information). As the used amines or thiols are smaller than
GSH, they diffuse toward the metal surface causing rupture of the
stabilized system.

Figure 2 Fluorescence spectral profile of WAuAgGSH when (A) long-chain
aliphatic
thiols are added individually, (B) long-chain aliphatic amines are
added individually, and (C) long-chain aliphatic amine and thiols
of the same chain length are introduced together. λex = 390 nm, RT. [Thiol/amine] = 1.6 × 10–4 M,
[WAuAgGSH] = 0.0132 mg/mL, total volume of solution = 3 mL TEM image
of (D) CH3(CH2)9SH–WAuAgGSH
and (E) CH3(CH2)9NH–WAuAgGSH.

Here, two prominent effects are
observed, (a) with the increase
in the chain length thiol or amine, the quenching of fluorescence
of the assembly becomes less prominent, and (b) an aliphatic thiol
of certain chain length shows higher quenching ability than an amine
of comparable chain length. Thiol and Au(I) interaction is predominant,
and thus the existing synergistic interaction between Au(I) and Ag(0)
is lost. It may be argued that still there are Ag clusters that can
show fluorescence but the natural tendency of Ag clusters toward aggregation
may be the reason of fluorescence quenching, but when amine is added
individually, although the WAuAgGSH system is ruptured, amine can
prevent the aggregation of Ag clusters. So the extent of quenching
is less with amine. To justify our conclusion, we have simultaneously
added thiol and amine to the WAuAgGSH solution. For this, we have
chosen the pair of [CH3(CH2)nSH] and [CH3(CH2)nNH] when n = 9, 11, 13, and 15, respectively,
for thiol and amine so that the effect of same chain length can be
visualized (Figure 2C). We have found that the quenching efficiency of thiols and amines
are in the order of thiol > thiol + amine > amine. When thiol
is present
in the solution, it diffuses directly toward the Au(I) surface but
amine is there to prevent the aggregation of Ag particles. To see
the effect prominently, we have used thiols and amines of comparable
chain length. TEM image has been taken for CH3(CH2)9SH–WAuAgGSH and CH3(CH2)9NH–WAuAgGSH systems. From TEM (Figure 2D,E) images, we see that the
large WAuAgGSH particles get converted to small aggregated particles.
Also, the quenching depends on the chain length. A thiol or amine
compound with shorter chain length causes pronounced quenching. It
is assumed that the thiols or amines diffuse toward the metal surface
by penetrating the GSH layer. So, with the increase in size, the diffusion
decreases which in turn causes prominent quenching. Lifetime values
of CH3(CH2)9SH–WAuAgGSH and
CH3(CH2)9NH–WAuAgGSH systems
have been calculated to be 1.26 and 1.65 ns, respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information).

Now,
CH3(CH2)9SH–WAuAgGSH
and CH3(CH2)9NH–WAuAgGSH systems
were subjected to further investigation. When different cations [Cr(III),
Co(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Fe(III), Hg(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II)] are added
to two solutions, we find that no cation can restore the lost fluorescence.
However, addition of Pb(II) selectively showed enhanced fluorescence
of WAuAgGSH. This enhancement may be due to the Pb(II)–GSH
interaction that increases positive environment around the Ag(0)Au(I)
system. However, the quenching of the fluorescence of WAuAgGSH in
the presence of long-chain aliphatic thiol and amine compounds cannot
be recovered as the long-chain aliphatic thiol and amine permanently
disrupts the stable fluorescing GSH protected Ag(0)Au(I) system (Figure 3). The disruption
of Au(I)–Ag(0) synergism in the presence of thiol or amine
is further confirmed by XPS studies of CH3(CH2)9SH–WAuAgGSH and CH3(CH2)9NH–WAuAgGSH. The shift in the Au(I) peaks from
84.5 and 88.1 to 83.7 and 87.4 eV, respectively, indicates that the
Au is in zero oxidation state rather than in +1 state39 in CH3(CH2)9SH–WAuAgGSH.
In this case, the Ag clusters undergo aggregation due to lack of a
stabilizing factor.40 XPS peaks appear
at lower regions, i.e., 367.03 and 373.02 eV for Ag(0) 3d5/2 and Ag(0) 3d3/2, respectively. For CH3(CH2)9NH–WAuAgGSH, the peaks of Au appeared
at 84.06 and 87.6 eV for Au(0) 4f7/2 and Au(0) 4f5/2, respectively. However, the peaks for Ag(0) appeared at slightly
higher region [367.7 and 373.6 eV for Ag(0) 3d5/2 and Ag(0)
3d3/2, respectively] than that in thiol-capped WAuAgGSH
(Figure S5, Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Fluorescence
spectral profile of (A) CH3(CH2)9SH–WAuAgGSH and (B) CH3(CH2)9NH–WAuAgGSH systems in the presence of different
cations. λex = 390 nm, RT. [Thiol/amine] = 1.6 ×
10–4 M and [cation] = 1.6 × 10–4 M, [WAuAgGSH] = 0.0132 mg/mL, total volume of solution = 3 mL. Cations
were added individually to the CH3(CH2)9SH–WAuAgGSH and CH3(CH2)9NH–WAuAgGSH systems.

In the next step, AuAgGSH is dissolved into weakly polar
organic
solvent ethanol and a fluorescent solution is produced. AuAgGSH in
ethanol (now termed as EAuAgGSH, quantum yield = 9.08%) shows fluorescence
at 580 nm when excited at 390 nm (Figure 4A). The measured average lifetime is 5.36
ns (Figure S6, Supporting Information).
It was reported that with the decrease in the solvent polarity, the
fluorescence intensity increases along with a blueshift of the emission
peak.41 However, in the present case, we
find no alteration of the emission peak. The Au(I) core is so stable
and Ag(0) clusters remain strongly anchored on Au(I) that eventually
the emission maximum remains unaltered even in different solvent systems.
Different dipolar interactions within the excited state fluorophore
and the surrounding molecules play the main role. The local environment
formed by the scaffold in the solvent caused bright fluorescence.
The excited state charge transfer is considered to be highly dependent
on solvent polarity.42,43 XPS studies show that the oxidation
state of the moiety does not change with solvent. Peaks at 368.2 and
374.4 eV represent binding energy for Ag(0) 3d5/2 and Ag(0)
3d3/2, respectively, and at 84.1 and 88.07 eV represent
Au(I) 4f7/2 and Au(I) 4f5/2, respectively (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The TEM image
shows interconnected particles with a diameter of ∼100 nm for
EAuAgGSH (Figure 4B).
This is a kind of solvent-induced aggregation.29

Figure 4 (A) Absorption and emission spectra of EAuAgGSH. λex = 390 nm, RT. (B) TEM image of EAuAgGSH.

When long-chain thiols or amines (Figure 5A) are added to EAuAgGSH individually, we
see that the amine-induced quenched fluorescence is less prominent
than thiol-induced fluorescence, as observed in aqueous medium. However,
the thiol or amine compound with longer hydrocarbon chain shows better
quenching unlike that in water. Such phenomenon is attributed to solvation
energy. Solvation of aliphatic thiols and amines is favored in nonpolar
solvent. Also, it worth mentioning that with the increase in the hydrocarbon
chain, the solvation of thiol and amine compound increases in nonpolar
solvents. In our case, the fluorescing assembly in nonpolar solvents
get stabilized by the surrounding solvent molecules, as evidenced
by the increased fluorescence intensity. Once thiol or amine is introduced
in the system, assembly–solvent interaction is interrupted
and quenching of fluorescence is observed. The fluorescence quenching
becomes pronounced with thiol and amine of longer hydrocarbon chain.
It is further observed that on addition of both thiol and amine of
comparable chain length at a time causes more quenching than that
which occurs due to their individual effect on the EAuAgGSH system.
Lifetime values of CH3(CH2)9SH–EAuAgGSH
and CH3(CH2)9NH–EAuAgGSH systems
have been calculated to be 1.91 and 2.96 ns, respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information). TEM images
(Figure 5B,C) of [CH3(CH2)15SH]–EAuAgGSH and [CH3(CH2)15NH]–EAuAgGSH show that
in the presence of long-chain thiol and amine compounds, the NPs disintegrate.
The proper solvent-coordinated structure becomes loosely aggregated.
As [CH3(CH2)15SH] and [CH3(CH2)15NH] cause maximum quenching, [CH3(CH2)15SH]–EAuAgGSH and [CH3(CH2)15NH]–EAuAgGSH solutions
were taken for further studies. On addition of certain metals to [CH3(CH2)15SH]–EAuAgGSH and [CH3(CH2)15NH]–EAuAgGSH, it is found
that Pb(II) selectively brings back the lost fluorescence (Figure 6). Pb(II) has an
inherent binding affinity toward thiol compounds. In the presence
of Pb(II), thiol compounds interact with Pb(II) and the solvent–Ag
cluster interaction is restored. However, in the previous case, we
have seen that the quenched fluorescence of WAuAgGSH cannot be recovered
as the fluorescent system is destroyed due to ligand exchange. Thus,
we find that the quenching of the fluorescence of EAuAgGSH is not
due to destruction of the GSH layer but rather due to the disruption
of electronic interaction between solvent and Ag cluster. It has been
observed that thiol or amine-added EAuAgGSH shows very weak emission
(λem = 580 nm) upon excitation at 390 nm, whereas
strongly fluorescing WAuAgGSH and EAuAgGSH particles also emit at
580 nm, when excited at 390 nm. As the fluorescence peak remains unaltered,
it is concluded that the EAuAgGSH particles are not ruptured, as it
happened for WAuAgGSH upon the addition of thiol or amine (Figure S8, Supporting Information). This may
be due to the fact that the thiol or amine becomes too bulky in association
with the solvent molecules, so they cannot approach the fluorescent
assembly in ethanol medium. Also, from XPS studies of CH3(CH2)15SH–EAuAgGSH and CH3(CH2)15NH–EAuAgGSH, we see that the
peaks for Au(I) remain unaltered, indicating that there is no direct
interaction between thiol or amines with the fluorescent assembly
(Figure S7, Supporting Information). It
should be mentioned that in the presence of Pb(II), the fluorescence
of EAuAgGSH is enhanced by ∼1.1-fold.

were added individually to the CH3(CH2)9SH–EAuAgGSH and CH3(CH2)9NH–EAuAgGSH systems.

This experiment is further continued for water immiscible
nonpolar
solvent n-heptane. AuAgGSH is dispersed in n-heptane with the aid of AOT, and a fluorescent solution
is generated. This is denoted as HAuAgGSH. Particles emit at 574 nm
when excited at 390 nm (quantum yield = 7.01%) (Figure 7A). The observed fluorescence spectra cannot
be correlated with the solvent polarity, but rather the presence of
reverse micelle AOT is the main factor for the observed spectra.44 They have an average lifetime of 3.93 ns (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The TEM image
(Figure 7B) shows that
the particles are ∼100 nm in diameter and a network-like structure
is observed. This is due to solvent-induced coordination. However,
XPS studies show that oxidation states remain +1 and 0 for Au and
Ag, respectively (Figure S10, Supporting
Information). Peaks are found at 368.5 and 374.7 eV, representing
binding energy for Ag(0) 3d5/2 and Ag(0) 3d3/2, respectively, and at 84.3 and 88.1 eV, representing Au(I) 4f7/2 and Au(I) 4f5/2, respectively.

spectra of HAuAgGSH. λex = 390 nm, RT. (B) TEM image

Intriguing fluorescence
of HAuAgGSH particles is drastically quenched
in the presence of long-chain aliphatic thiols and amines. In this
case also, amines show lower quenching than thiols. However, variation
of chain length of the thiols shows that the increase in the chain
length of thiols causes a pronounced quenching effect (Figure 8). We assume that solvation
energy is that factor that works behind this behavior, as in the case
of ethanol. Thiol or amine compounds with a long hydrocarbon chain
are easily dissolved in nonpolar n-heptane. Longer
hydrocarbon chain will show higher nonpolarity and thus higher solvation.
Thus, longer thiol or amine caused more effective quenching of fluorescence.
Again, as thiols or amines becomes highly solvated, they cannot diffuse
toward fluorescent moiety. Hence, the assembly remains undisturbed
and the quenching is mainly caused due to interruption of solvent–assembly
interaction in the AOT/heptanes system. Lifetime values of CH3(CH2)9SH–EAuAgGSH and CH3(CH2)9NH–EAuAgGSH systems have
been calculated to be 1.51 and 1.32 ns, respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information). TEM images
(Figure 8B,C) of [CH3(CH2)15SH]–HAuAgGSH and [CH3(CH2)15NH]–HAuAgGSH show that
in the presence of long-chain thiol and amine, the NPs become loosely
aggregated. As [CH3(CH2)15SH] and
[CH3(CH2)15NH] cause maximum quenching,
[CH3(CH2)15SH]–HAuAgGSH and
[CH3(CH2)15NH]–HAuAgGSH solutions
were taken for further studies. The XPS studies of [CH3(CH2)15SH]–HAuAgGSH and [CH3(CH2)15NH]–HAuAgGSH reveal that the
oxidation state of Au and Ag remains the same, i.e., +1 for Au and
0 for Ag (Figure S10, Supporting Information).
In this case also, the quenched fluorescence of [CH3(CH2)15SH]–HAuAgGSH and [CH3(CH2)15NH]–HAuAgGSH can be selectively triggered
to turn on response in the presence of Pb(II) ion in the system (Figure 9).

10–4 M and [cation] = 1.6 × 10–4 M, [HAuAgGSH] = 0.0132 mg/mL, total volume of solution = 3 mL. Cations
were added individually to the CH3(CH2)9SH–HAuAgGSH and CH3(CH2)9NH–HAuAgGSH systems.

The mechanism of Pb(II)-induced fluorescence recovery has
been
experimentally verified. Primarily, it is considered that due to preferential
binding of thiols or amines with the added Pb(II) ions, the prevalent
solvent–thiol or solvent–amine interaction is disrupted.
Under this circumstance, the EAuAgGSH/HAuAgGSH–solvent interaction
is re-established in the nonaqueous medium only as thiol or amines
become engaged to bind Pb(II) ion. This has been further verified
bringing Na2EDTA into the system. Na2EDTA is
a well-known chelating agent that easily binds Pb(II) in solution,
and thus the effect of Pb(II) is masked. This let us to conclude that
removal of quencher thiols or amines by Pb(II) is the cause of recovery
of fluorescence in the nonaqueous medium. However, in aqueous medium,
the thiol or amine-mediated quenching of fluorescence of the assembly
is due to the complete rupture of the fluorescent assembly. Hence,
in aqueous medium, Pb(II) ion cannot restore the fluorescent assembly
and thus becomes ineffective. It is worth mentioning that the fluorescence
of the assembly increases in the presence of Pb(II) ion when thiol
or amine is absent. The reason behind this phenomenon is stable Pb–GSSG
interaction that protects fluorescent assemblies from aggregation
due to Pb(II)-bound interparticle electrostatic repulsion.

So
we conclude that the AuAgGSH behaves in the same way in nonaqueous
solvents. When long-chain aliphatic thiol or amine compounds are added
to these systems, the solvent–Ag cluster interaction is disturbed.
This causes fluorescence quenching. During the experiment, we have
also found that the exchange of ligand GSH with aliphatic thiol or
amine causes quenching in fluorescence of HAuAgGSH as well as EAuAgGSH
and the lost fluorescence is selectively recovered by Pb(II) ions.
This is schematically shown in Figure 10. This result is consistent with the Boolean
logic operation IMPLICATION (Supporting Information) with more than one input signal. A binary IMPLICATION logic operation
(Figure 11), represented
by the situation in which the output is 1 when both the inputs are
absent or both the inputs are present but output is 0 when either
of the inputs are present, can be implemented using HAuAgGSH or EAuAgGSH
as the gate and individual aliphatic thiol or amine and Pb(II) as
binary inputs. IMPLICATION gates are noncommutative and cannot be
expressed by the negation of one of the other basic gates.45,46 However, for WAuAgGSH, such a feasible molecular logic gate cannot
be constructed on the basis of the response of the inputs.

Different interactions between
the as-synthesized fluorescent assembly
and the ligands cause the difference in construction of molecular
logic gates. Hence, this is an important work from the academic as
well as experimental point of view.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have successfully explored the evolution of fluorescent
AuAgGSH assembly and then examined the effect of aliphatic thiols
and amines of varied chain lengths on the fluorescence property of
the assembly in different solvents. It has been proven that destruction
and retention of the fluorescent assembly happens in water and organic
solvents, respectively, with added thiols and amines. Furthermore,
thiol and amine chain length-dependent fluorescence quenching of the
assembly has been reported. The quenching of fluorescence in nonaqueous
medium is explained considering the disruption of the existing electronic
interaction between the solvent and fluorescent assembly. For the
nonaqueous systems, quenched fluorescence is recovered bringing Pb(II)
ions in the system. Then, using thiol or amine and Pb(II) as two inputs
we have constructed the IMPLICATION molecular logic gate. However,
only in water, such ligand exchange actually occurs and that ruptures
the fluorescent system permanently without leaving a way for fluorescence
recovery, so no useful molecular logic gate can be constructed in
water medium. Thus, the nature of solvent-controlled application of
the fluorescent assembly is proved.
