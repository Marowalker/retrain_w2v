The
development of new electron-accepting π-conjugated systems
for application as nonfullerene acceptors in organic solar cells (OSCs)
is urgently needed. Although π-conjugated systems based on naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NTz) and naphthalimide (Np) as central and terminal
units, respectively, represent possible candidates for nonfullerene
acceptors, our knowledge of the structure–property–device
performance relationship of these compounds remains limited. We report
herein on an investigation of the effect of the substituents on the
thiophene (T) linker between NTz and Np on the properties and photovoltaic performance. The photophysical
and physicochemical measurements showed that the absorption behavior
as well as frontier-orbital energy levels can be fine-tuned by the
choice of the substituent on the thiophene rings. Bulk-heterojunction-type
OSCs based on these acceptors under blending with poly(3-hexylthiophene)
as a donor showed various power conversion efficiencies, ranging from
0.26 to 2.14%. The substituents on the thiophene rings also have a
significant influence on the blend film properties, which explain
the differences in the short-circuit current densities and fill factors
in the OSCs. These results indicate the importance of molecular design
in preparing nonfullerene acceptors with NTz and Np units in terms of tuning both the molecular properties
of the materials and donor–acceptor interface engineering in
the blended films.

Introduction
For the past two decades,
solution-processed bulk-heterojunction
(BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive research
interest from both academic and industrial scientists because of their
advantages of lightweight, low cost, mechanical flexibility, and compatibility
with roll-to-roll printing processes.1−5 Both hole-transporting (donor) and electron-transporting (acceptor)
organic semiconductors are the required components for the fabrication
of BHJ-type active layers in OSCs.6−9 Extensive research has resulted in a widely
accepted general molecular design for high-performance donor materials,
which is based on donor–acceptor configurations in π-conjugated
systems.10−15 In terms of acceptors, fullerene derivatives have contributed substantially
to the enhancement of photovoltaic performance as well as our fundamental
understanding of photoinduced charge generation.16−19 However, they have some limitations,
including weak light absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions,
high cost, tedious purification procedures, and insufficient morphological
stability.20−23 To address these problems, considerable efforts have been expended
on the development of nonfullerene acceptors.24−34 In terms of adapting the energy levels to those of donors to facilitate
charge separation and to obtain a high open-circuit voltage, a rational
guideline for the creation of acceptors would be to lower the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy to an appropriate level.
In this context, novel electron-accepting π-conjugated systems
derived by the introduction of electron-deficient units have become
candidates for acceptors. Although π-conjugated systems based
on 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene) (ITIC) have been reported to show a high power
conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 13%,34−36 the range of
appropriate electron-deficient units is still limited.37−43

We recently reported, for the first time, that naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NTz) can function as an electron-deficient unit in nonfullerene
acceptors.44 A new electron-accepting π-conjugated
system, which combines NTz with the naphthalimide (Np) terminal units and thiophene (T) as a π-linker,
showed good OSC characteristics with a PCE of 2.81% in combination
with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a donor (Figure 1).44 In this system,
the acetylene linker is effective to maintain the planarity of the
π-conjugated structure and thus to delocalize the LUMO, resulting
in the lowered LUMO energy level. It is important to note that the NTz-containing acceptor showed a superior performance compared
to the benzothiadiazole (BTz)-containing acceptor. We
also found that the expansion of π-conjugation in the terminal
unit from phthalimide to Np is effective when it is combined
with the BTz central unit.45 However, to confirm that these NTz-based compounds
can function as new types of acceptors, the structure–property
relationships of the compounds will need to be explored thoroughly.
In this contribution, we report on the design and development of some
new acceptor molecules NTz-TH-Np, NTz-TF-Np, NTz-Thex-Np, and NTz-Teh-Np, in which the thiophene moiety contains various substituents (hydrogen,
fluorine, n-alkyl chain, or branched alkyl chain),
and an investigation of the effect of these substituents on their
properties and photovoltaic performance (Figure 1). Note that we revealed that the dibutyl-substituted
fluorene in the Np unit is an effective terminal substituent
to obtain good photovoltaic characteristics.44,46 During the synthesis of the molecules, we noticed that the solubility
of the NTz-TH-Np and NTz-TF-Np compounds
that contain dibutyl-substituted fluorene units on the nitrogen atom
of Np was limited. Therefore, in this study, we utilized
dihexyl-substituted fluorene to ensure adequate solubility and a high
surface free energy.47,48

acceptors containing the NTz unit.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic route for
preparing the target
compounds is shown in Schemes 1 and 2. As we used a transition metal-catalyzed
coupling reaction to connect the central units with 2 equiv of terminal
units, both components need to be sufficiently soluble to permit the
reaction to proceed. On the basis of this strategy, we attached unsubstituted
thiophene (TH) and fluorinated
thiophene (TF) to the Np-containing components, whereas the alkyl-substituted thiophene units
(Thex and Teh) were attached to the NTz-containing
components. Br-TH-Np and Br-TF-Np units
were synthesized by the Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling reactions
(Scheme 1). In this
synthetic scheme, we omitted the purification of tetramethyl silane
(TMS)-deprotected Np derivative to prevent the decomposition
of the terminal ethynyl compound during purification. Lastly, the
target compounds were synthesized by the Suzuki or Sonogashira–Hagihara
coupling reactions (Scheme 2). Because of the presence of multiple alkyl chains, these
molecules were sufficiently soluble in common organic solvents such
as chloroform (CHCl3), chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) to permit their
physical properties to be examined in solutions as well as solution-processing
device fabrication. The new compounds were completely characterized
by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry,
and elemental analysis, and the results can be found in the Supporting Information.

Units

Thermal Properties
The thermal properties of the synthesized
compounds were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with a heating rate of
10 °C min–1 in N2. As shown in Figure S1a, the TGA curves of these compounds
showed a 5% weight loss at temperatures (Td) above 390 °C, confirming that they were sufficiently thermally
stable for use in OSC applications. As shown in Figure S1b, clear melting endothermic peaks were observed
over 230 °C for NTz-TF-Np, NTz-Thex-Np, and NTz-Teh-Np in the DSC curves. Although a sharp exothermic peak was observed
at around 235 °C for NTz-TH-Np in the first scan, all of the compounds showed mostly
an amorphous behavior in the second scan. On the basis of the observed
melting temperature, we investigated the thermal annealing temperature
of OSCs up to 160 °C and found that 140 °C is the optimized
condition for these materials (see below).

Photophysical and Electrochemical
Properties
The UV–vis
absorption spectra of NTz-TH-Np, NTz-TF-Np, NTz-Thex-Np,
and NTz-Teh-Np in
CHCl3 solution and in the form of a film on a quartz plate
are shown in Figure 2. The corresponding spectroscopic data including molar extinction
coefficient (ε) are summarized in Table 1. The main absorption bands for these compounds
were observed at around 500 nm. As we reported in a previous study,
these bands can mainly be attributed to the transition from the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to LUMO.41 Owing to the presence of the electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms,
the absorption spectrum of NTz-TF-Np was blue-shifted compared to that of NTz-TH-Np. In contrast, the absorption
in the case of electron-donating alkyl substituents were red-shifted.
The fact that the absorption of NTz-Thex-Np and NTz-Teh-Np was nearly superimposable indicates that the
presence of an alkyl chain on the thiophene ring has a negligible
influence on the electronic properties of the π-conjugated backbone
in solutions. The absorption coefficients of NTz-TH-Np, NTz-TF-Np, NTz-Thex-Np, and NTz-Teh-Np in the films were determined to be 1.2 ×
103, 8.7 × 102, 6.2 × 103, and 5.1 × 103 nm–1, respectively.
This qualitative trend is in good agreement with that of the ε
values. The absorption spectra in the film state were somewhat red-shifted
compared to those in solution. A weak shoulder that was present in
all the films implies the existence of intermolecular π–π
interactions. The optical HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (ΔEgopt) of NTz-TH-Np, NTz-TF-Np, NTz-Thex-Np, and NTz-Teh-Np extracted from the absorption
onset in films were 1.98, 2.01, 1.86, and 1.85 eV, respectively.

The electrochemical
behavior of these acceptors was investigated
by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV)
in an o-DCB/acetonitrile (CH3CN) (10:1)
solution containing 0.1 M tetrabultylammonium hexafluorophosphate
(TBAPF6). The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+)
redox couple was used as an internal standard for the calibration
of the potentials. No oxidation wave was found within the potential
window of the solvent. In contrast, all of the compounds showed four
reversible reduction waves and one quasi-reversible wave in CV measurements
(Figure 3a), indicating
that the type of substituent in the molecules has little influence
on the kinetic stability of the anionic species formed under electrochemical
conditions. As we previously reported, the first and fourth reduction
waves are assigned to the two-step reductions of the central NTz part, whereas the second and third reduction waves are
assigned to the terminal Np units.44 The first reduction potential of NTz-TF-Np was positively shifted compared
to the other compounds, indicating that, of these molecules, NTz-TF-Np has strong
electron-accepting characteristics. This is due to the presence of
the electron-withdrawing fluorine substitutions on the thiophene ring.
On the other hand, compounds having electron-donating alkyl-substituted
thiophenes (Thex and Teh) showed more negative first reduction
potentials, compared with NTz-TH-Np. As shown in Figure S2, similar narrow splits in the reduction waves originating from the Np units suggest that the electronic communication between
the central and terminal units are limited and small in the molecules
and are not greatly affected by the substituents on the thiophene
rings. As a result, these molecules form closely spaced multiple unoccupied
molecular orbitals, as supported by the theoretical calculations shown
in Figure S3. On the basis of the onset
of the first reduction potential (Eonsetred) of CVs and the assumption
that the energy level of Fc/Fc+ is −4.8 eV below
the vacuum level,49−51 the ELUMO of NTz-TH-Np, NTz-TF-Np, NTz-Thex-Np, and NTz-Teh-Np was estimated to be −3.48,
−3.57, −3.42, and −3.43 eV, respectively. The
HOMO energy levels (EHOMO) of these compounds
were determined by photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) in the
film state (Figure 3b). From the onset of the spectra, the EHOMO for NTz-TH-Np, NTz-TF-Np, NTz-Thex-Np, and NTz-Teh-Np were determined to be
−6.16, −6.29, −6.12, and −6.15 eV, respectively.
These ELUMO and EHOMO as well as ΔEgopt values are qualitatively in
agreement with the calculated values (Figure S3). These results indicate that the substituents on the thiophene
rings can be used to precisely tune the molecular properties. Considering
that the ELUMO and EHOMO of P3HT are −2.81 and −4.72 eV, respectively,52 these synthesized compounds would be expected
to conduct effective charge separation from the excitons via electron
or hole transport as an OSC acceptor in combination with P3HT as a
donor.

Photovoltaic Characteristics
To investigate the effect
of the substituents on the thiophene rings on the photovoltaic characteristics,
BHJ-type photovoltaic devices with a conventional structure, indium
tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:poly(styrene
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/Ca/Al, were fabricated. The active
layers, which consist of P3HT as a donor and the individual newly
synthesized compound (NTz-TH-Np, NTz-TF-Np, NTz-Thex-Np,
or NTz-Teh-Np) as
an acceptor, were prepared by spin-coating from the blended solutions.
For a direct comparison of OSC performance, the fabrication conditions
for the BHJ active layer were fixed as follows: a donor/acceptor blend
composition of 1:1 ratio, a concentration of 20 mg mL–1 in CB, and thermal annealing at 140 °C for 15 min. Under these
conditions, the film thickness was in a narrow range between 98 and
107 nm. To confirm the reproducibility of the OSC performance, we
fabricated six devices for each blend using the fixed conditions.
The best-performance current density (J)–voltage
(V) characteristics under simulated AM 1.5G solar
irradiation (100 mW cm–2) in a nitrogen atmosphere
and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for each device are
shown in Figure 4.
The corresponding key photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. All reproducibility
data are summarized in Figure S4 and Tables S1–S4. All of the devices showed
typical photovoltaic responses, indicating that the synthesized compounds
functioned as acceptors. However, their PCEs resulted in a broad range,
and the P3HT:NTz-Thex-Np-based device showed the highest PCE of 2.14% with an open-circuit
voltage (VOC) of 0.92 V, a fill factor
(FF) of 0.52, and a short-circuit current density (JSC) value of 4.50 mA cm–2. On a closer
look at the key photovoltaic parameters, the VOC value was increased with an increasing ELUMO of the acceptors and reached 0.92 V for NTz-Thex-Np. This trend is in good
agreement with the fact that the VOC of
the OSC device is controlled by the difference in the energy level
between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor.53 In terms of JSC and
FF, the values of the acceptors with alkyl groups on the thiophene
ring (NTz-Thex-Np and NTz-Teh-Np) were higher than those of NTz-TH-Np and NTz-TF-Np. Under the same experimental setup and the same
blend composition of 1:1 ratio, the OSC devices based on P3HT and
typical fullerene acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid
methyl ester showed a PCE of 2.68% with a VOC of 0.59 V, an FF of 0.61, and a JSC value
of 7.53 mA cm–2. In comparison with these values,
P3HT:NTz-Thex-Np showed comparable PCE and higher VOC values, indicating the potential for the NTz-based
nonfullerene acceptor materials.

Blend Film Evaluation
As the hole-
and electron-transporting
characteristics of blend films provided a good indication of the magnitude
of JSC and FF in the OSCs, we estimated
the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) mobilities of the blend films
by hole-only and electron-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active
layer/Au and ITO/TiOx/active layer/Ca/Au,
respectively (Figure S5). As summarized
in Table 2, the values
for both the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility
(μe) of the P3HT:NTz-Thex-Np and P3HT:NTz-Teh-Np films were one order of magnitude higher than
those of P3HT:NTz-TH-Np and P3HT:NTz-TF-Np. Furthermore, the P3HT:NTz-Thex-Np film showed balanced μh and μe of 1.0 × 10–5 and 1.3 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively, which are responsible for the high JSC and FF values among the investigated devices.

To investigate the relationship between the molecular structure of
the acceptors and device performance, we carried out atomic force
microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–vis, and photoluminescence
(PL) measurements on the blend films. As shown in Figures 5 and S6, the AFM images of all of the blend films showed the formation of
nanometer-scale grains with an average roughness (Ra) of 2.23, 0.45, 1.02, and 0.87 nm for the P3HT blend
film with NTz-TH-Np, NTz-TF-Np, NTz-Thex-Np, and NTz-Teh-Np, respectively. By taking
the OSC results into consideration, the moderate Ra values of the P3HT:NTz-Thex-Np and P3HT:NTz-Teh-Np films would be expected to be advantageous for an
effective exciton dissociation in the blend films. As summarized in Table 3, the values for the
surface free energies (SFEs) of the NTz-Thex-Np and NTz-Teh-Np pristine films were larger than those of NTz-TH-Np and NTz-TF-Np. When the SFE values
of the acceptors were increased, the Ra of the blend films was decreased for NTz-TF-Np, NTz-Thex-Np, and NTz-Teh-Np. This phenomenon
indicates that the large difference in SFEs between the acceptors
and P3HT (9.7 mJ cm–2) contributes to the formation
of phase-separated morphologies.54 On the
other hand, although the SFE value for NTz-TH-Np was
similar to that for NTz-TF-Np, P3HT:NTz-TH-Np showed the largest Ra among the blend
films. As discussed below, the crystalline behavior of P3HT in the
P3HT:NTz-TH-Np blend films may be a cause for the rough
film morphologies.

The XRD measurements of the blend
films showed the appearance of
XRD signals at 2θ = 5.4° corresponding to the ordered (100)
peak of P3HT (Figure 6a). It is particularly noteworthy that the P3HT:NTz-TH-Np film showed an intense peak. In general, the formation of a crystalline
structure in a blend film leads to an increase in the photovoltaic
characteristics because of the formation of charge-carrier transport
pathways.55 However, the photovoltaic performance
of the P3HT:NTz-TH-Np film was moderate and had the lowest
SCLC hole mobility among the devices that were investigated. Furthermore,
the UV–vis absorption spectra of the P3HT:NTz-TH-Np films showed a lower absorbance compared to those of the other blend
films (Figure 6b).
On the basis of these results, we considered that the presence of NTz-TH-Np tends to form
P3HT crystalline domains with different orientations to other combinations
in the film, which is disadvantageous for incident photon absorption
and carrier-transport in OSCs.

Figure 6 (a) XRD, (b) UV–vis, and (c) PL
spectra of the P3HT:NTz-TH-Np (black), P3HT:NTz-TF-Np (green), P3HT:NTz-Thex-Np (red), and
P3HT:NTz-Teh-Np (blue)
films. For comparison, the PL spectrum of P3HT is shown as an orange
line.

The PL spectra of the blend films
along with a P3HT pristine film,
excited at the absorption maximum for P3HT, are shown in Figure 6c. The PL of the
P3HT:NTz-TH-Np, P3HT:NTz-TF-Np, and P3HT:NTz-Thex-Np films was
largely quenched, whereas we observed a PL for the P3HT:NTz-Teh-Np film. This result indicates
that the bulky 2-ethylhexyl groups on the thiophene ring partially
prevent the π-framework to the D–A interface to be exposed,
which is not favorable for the exciton diffusion to the D–A
interface and charge transfer at the interface. As a result, the JSC and FF values for P3HT:NTz-Teh-Np were inferior to those
of P3HT:NTz-Thex-Np. This suggests that the presence of sterically bulky substituents
in the terminal positions of the acceptor π-framework leads
to a large London dispersion (γd) value of SFE and
becomes a general strategy for orienting the π-conjugated frameworks
toward the D–A interface, which, in turn, contributes to improving
the photovoltaic characteristics based on nonfullerene acceptors with
both linear and three-dimensional structures.47,48 In fact, the London dispersion (γd) of SFE of NTz-Thex-Np and NTz-Teh-Np showed large
values of more than 30 mJ cm–2 (Table 3), implying that appropriate
D–A interfaces were formed in the blend films. In addition
to this guideline, these results indicate that the introduction of
bulky substituents without disrupting the intermolecular π-framework
interactions at the D–A interface represents an effective approach.
Therefore, we conclude that achieving these molecular designs by the
fine-tuning of substituents on the thiophene rings represents an important
strategy for further developing the NTz-based nonfullerene
acceptors.

Conclusions
In summary, to investigate
the effect of substituents on the thiophene
linker on the properties and photovoltaic characteristics, we designed
and synthesized a series of new nonfullerene acceptors bearing NTz as an electron-deficient central core coupled with a terminal Np via a thiophene linker containing various substituents
(hydrogen, fluorine, hexyl, and 2-ethylhexyl groups). The UV–vis,
CV, and PESA measurements showed that the absorption properties as
well as HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these acceptors could be finely
controlled by the substituents on the thiophene spacer. The BHJ solar
cells based on these acceptors and P3HT as a donor showed photovoltaic
characteristics with PCEs in the range between 0.26 and 2.14%. An
investigation of the blend films by the SCLC, AFM, XRD, UV–vis,
and PL measurements revealed that the substituents on the thiophene
rings in the acceptors have a significant influence on the film morphologies,
crystallinity, and photophysical properties. These results partly
explain the differences in the JSC and
FF in the OSCs. The results reported herein promise to enable us to
design new electron-accepting π-conjugated molecules having NTz and Np units in terms of tuning both molecular
properties and donor–acceptor interface engineering in the
blend films, which also provides a clue for developing a general methodology
for constructing nonfullerene acceptors. Further studies directed
at the development of NTz-based acceptors with the fine-tuning
of energy levels in the properties and miscibility in the blend films
as well as OSC device optimization under the combination of donor–acceptor-type
copolymers are currently underway by our group.

Experimental Section
General
Information
Silica gel, KANTO Chemical silica
gel 60 N (40–50 μm), was used for column chromatography,
and thin-layer plates were detected with UV light. Preparative gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) was carried out on a Japan Analytical
Industry LC-918 equipped with JAI-GEL 1H/2H. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in deuterated solvent by a JEOL
ECS-400 spectrometer with TMS as an internal standard. NMR data were
represented as follows: chemical shift in ppm (δ), multiplicity
(s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet, br = broad),
coupling constant (Hz). Decoupling for 19F was not applied
to these measurements. The mass spectra of the compounds were recorded
on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP-5050 or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight (Shimadzu AXIMA-TOF) with 1,8,9-trihydroxyanthracene
as a matrix. The elemental analyses of the new compounds were made
using a PerkinElmer LS-50B with the help of the Elemental Analysis
Section of Comprehensive Analysis Center (CAC), ISIR, Osaka University.

The TGA measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu TGA-50 under
purified nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. The DSC measurements were performed with a Shimadzu DSC-60 under
purified nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. The UV–vis absorption spectra were measured using a Shimadzu
UV-3600 spectrophotometer. The CV and DPV measurements were performed
at room temperature (rt) using a BAS CV-620C voltammetric analyzer
deploying a platinum disk as the working electrode, platinum wire
as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgNO3 as the reference
electrode at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. The PESA
measurements were carried out using a Riken Keiki Co. Ltd. AC-3 under
the light intensity of 20 mW. The fluorescence spectra were measured
using a Fluoromax-4 spectrometer in the photocounting mode with a
Hamamatsu R928P photomultiplier. For UV–vis and fluorescence
experiments, solvents with spectroscopic grade were used. The crystallinity
of the thin films was evaluated by an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku,
SmartLab), and the XRD patterns were recorded using Bragg–Brentano
geometry with Cu Kα radiation as an X-ray source. An acceleration
voltage of 45 kV and a beam current of 200 mA were utilized for these
measurements. The scanning mode was fixed to 2θ–θ
scan between 2° and 30° with the scanning steps of 0.01°.
The surface morphologies (height and phase mode) of the thin films
were observed by AFM (Shimadzu, SPM9600).

Preparation of Materials
All the chemicals were purchased
from commercial suppliers and used without purification, unless specified
otherwise. A nitrogen atmosphere was maintained for carrying out all
the reactions. The solvents of the highest purity grade were utilized
as received from the commercial sources. Our reported procedures were
utilized to synthesize 1a and 1b.44,56

Photovoltaic Device Fabrication
The ITO-coated glass
substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in toluene, acetone, water,
and 2-propanol for 10 min, respectively, and then activated by ozone
treatment for 1 h. The PEDOT:PSS layer was formed by spin-coating
(3000 rpm for 1 min) on the ITO surface and dried at 135 °C for
10 min. The active layers based on P3HT and new acceptors were spin-coated
(1000 rpm for 2 min) on the PEDOT:PSS layer and annealed at 140 °C
for 15 min in a glovebox, providing a thickness of around 98–107
nm. The thickness of the active layer was measured by a KLA Tencor
Alpha-step IQ apparatus. Finally, the Ca (30 nm) and Al (100 nm) electrodes
were deposited through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation on the
top of the active layer to define the active area of the devices (0.09
cm2) under a vacuum of 10–5 Pa. This
thickness was measured by a quartz crystal monitor. After sealing
these devices from the air, the current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics were recorded
under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm–2) (SAN-EI ELECTRIC, XES-301S). The J–V characteristics of the solar cell devices were recorded
using a KEITHLEY 2400 source meter. The EQE spectra of the same devices
were measured by using a Soma Optics Ltd. S-9240.

SCLC Measurements
The mobility measurements were carried
out with the following diode device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend
films/Au and ITO/TiOx/blend films/Ca/Au,
for the hole-only and electron-only devices, respectively. The blend
films were prepared from 20 mg mL–1 solution of
P3HT and new acceptors in CB. The charge-carrier mobilities of these
devices were calculated using the SCLC model by the following equation:  where ε,
ε0, μ,
and d are the dielectric constant of the blend films,
the permittivity of free space, the carrier mobility, and the measured
thickness of the blend films within the device, respectively. The
values of ε = 3 and ε0 = 8.8 × 10–12 were used in this equation.

SFE Estimation
For the estimation of SFE of the newly
synthesized acceptors, the compounds were spin-coated on the quartz
substrate to form uniform films. These films were prepared by spin-coating
using 10 mg mL–1 CHCl3 solution and dried
in air. The contact angles of the film surface were measured by a
NiCK LSE-ME1 contact angle meter using 50 μL of distilled water
and glycerol as two distinct liquids. The following simultaneous equation
was used for the determination of SFE of the new acceptors, where
θ, γL, and γS are the contact
angle, surface energy of liquid, and surface energy of surface, respectively,
in this equation.
