The miscibility and physical and rheological properties
of binary
poly(vinylidene fluoride)/maleic anhydride (PVDF/MAH) blends have
been systematically investigated. MAH was found to be miscible with
PVDF by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) investigations provided positive evidence
for the specific interaction between the carbonyl groups of MAH and
the methylene groups of PVDF. Rheological measurements showed that
both the storage modulus and the melt viscosity of PVDF increase with
the addition of MAH, followed by a decrease with excess MAH. In addition,
the elongation of the PVDF/MAH blend with 10 wt % MAH is 589.7%, which
is almost 5 times that of neat PVDF. It is concluded that MAH small
molecules act as physical “crosslinking” points for
the neighboring PVDF molecule chains due to this specific interaction
between PVDF and MAH. Such a physical crosslinking function enhances
the storage modulus, viscosity, and mechanical properties of PVDF.

1 Introduction
Poly(vinylidene fluoride)
(PVDF) is an important semicrystalline
fluoropolymer. Due to its excellent heat resistance, climate resistance,
processability, and irradiation resistance, PVDF has attracted both
academic and industrial attention. It is an economic and easy strategy
to obtain high-performance PVDF composites by blending PVDF with other
polymers.1−3 However, the overall improvement is limited due to
the poor miscibility between PVDF and these polymers. Generally speaking,
the final properties of the material are closely related to the compatibility
of the two components in the blend. Besides, the intermolecular interactions
between the two components in the blend play an important role in
their miscibility. The four most common interactions include the acid–base
type,4 hydrogen bonding,5 dipole–dipole,6 and charge-transfer7 interactions. In particular, hydrogen bonding
often acts as a miscibility enhancer, which has been proved in several
studies.8,9 A vast majority of the studies have emphasized
that PVDF/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) are completely miscible
because of the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the carbonyl
group of PMMA and the acidic hydrogen of PVDF.5,10 Additionally,
various nanofillers have been used to modify the PVDF matrix, leading
to the improvement of the mechanical and ferroelectric properties
of PVDF.11−13 Tiwari11 reported the
preparation of polar PVDF by amine-modified porous silica nanofillers.
The PVDF film with porous silica exhibited a high relative intensity
of the β-phase and strong adhesive strength over different metallic
substrates.

Maleic anhydride (MAH) is a polar compound containing
many functional
groups, especially the unsaturated double bonds, which is easy to
polymerize with other polymers by adding some agents or by irradiation.14,15 Moreover, the anhydride groups can also react with hydroxyl, carboxyl,
amine, and other functional groups. Therefore, MAH functionalization
of some nonpolar polymers is beneficial to increase their compatibility
with polar polymers and improve the adhesion of materials and the
interaction between fillers and polymers.16−19 Dang and co-workers16 reported PVDF/PP composites with high dielectric
properties. Polypropylene grafted malefic anhydride (PP-g-MAH) acts
as a suitable compatibilizer, which can efficiently increase the dielectric
permittivity of composites. lqbal and co-workers17 reported the chemical modification of low density polyethylene
(LDPE) with MAH in a twin-screw extruder, using BPO as an initiator.
The grafting degree first increased with the increasing content of
BPO and MAH, and then decreased continuously on further increasing
the BPO and MAH content. Ismail and co-workers18 also fabricated ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM)-g-MAH
through melt-blending. They believed that the enhancement of interfacial
interaction in compatibilized EPDM/bentonite (Bt) composites was due
to the presence of the EPDM-g-MAH compatibilizer promoting the dispersion
of Bt particles in the EPDM matrix. It is an effective strategy to
modify polymers using MAH, although the modification of PVDF with
MAH is rarely reported in the past decades. Meanwhile, the functionality
of PVDF by reactive groups is another effective method to improve
the miscibility between PVDF and other polymers.

In this work,
MAH was introduced to modify PVDF owing to the reactivity
of the anhydride group on the MAH monomer, which makes it possible
to expand the applications of PVDF. Besides, the immobilization of
the MAH monomer onto PVDF chains can be achieved by adding some agents
or by irradiation, due to the unsaturated double bonds on the MAH
monomer. The miscibility, properties, and specific interaction of
PVDF/MAH binary blends have been investigated systematically. The
physical and rheological properties of PVDF/MAH blends are significantly
different from those of other PVDF blends with other small molecules
due to the specific interactions between carboxyl groups of MAH and
methylene groups of PVDF. Such interactions make the MAH play the
role of physically bridging the molecular chains of PVDF.

2 Results
2.1 Morphology of the PVDF/MAH Blends
The cross-sectional surfaces of PVDF and PVDF/MAH blends with different
MAH contents (1, 5, and 10 wt %) before and after acetone etching
are shown in Figure 1. Similar to the homogeneous phase of neat PVDF, after adding MAH
(1–10 wt %), no apparent phase separation was observed in PVDF/MAH
binary blends. To confirm the dispersion of MAH in the PVDF matrix,
all of the PVDF/MAH blends were etched by acetone, which is a good
solvent for MAH but a nonsolvent for PVDF, and then dried at 50 °C
under a vacuum atmosphere for 3 h before SEM observation. The morphologies
of etched PVDF/MAH blends are similar to the blends before etching,
indicating the good miscibility between PVDF and MAH.

surface morphologies of PVDF and PVDF/MAH
blends with different MAH contents before and after acetone-selective
etching.

2.2 Physical Properties of the PVDF/MAH Blends
Figure 2a shows
the stress–elongation curves of PVDF and PVDF/MAH blends with
different MAH contents. The yielding strength and elongation as functions
of MAH contents are shown in Figure 2b. Compared with the neat PVDF, the yielding strength
and modulus of the blends are reduced slightly with the incorporation
of MAH due to the plasticization effect of MAH. Besides, the elongation
of samples greatly increases with the increasing MAH content, which
indicates that the addition of MAH improves the ductility of PVDF.
The elongation of the sample with 10 wt % MAH is 589.7%, which is
almost five times that of neat PVDF. Moreover, the fracture strength
at the break of blend is significantly increased from 36.4 MPa (neat
PVDF) to 63.6 MPa (blend with 10 wt % MAH), an increase of nearly
1.75 times.

contents. (a) Stress–elongation curves; (b) Yielding strength
and elongation as functions of MAH contents.

2.3 Rheological Properties of PVDF and the PVDF/MAH
Blends
Small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) is an effective
method to determine the structure/phase behavior of the blend system.20,21 The frequency dependencies of the storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″), complex viscosity
|η*|, and damping factor (Tan δ) of neat PVDF and PVDF/MAH
blends with different constituents are plotted in Figure 3a–d, respectively. It
is found that the G′ and G″ values of various PVDF/MAH blends were higher than those
of neat PVDF at the high detection frequency, reaches the maximum
when the MAH content is 5 wt %, and then decreases slightly at a high
MAH content (8–10 wt %). It is generally believed that small
molecules often act as the diluents or plasticizers of polymers; therefore,
the modulus of the blend system will be decreased with the incorporation
of small molecules. However, the modulus of PVDF/MAH blends significantly
increases with the addition of MAH compared to that of neat PVDF,
indicating the presence of strong intermolecular interactions in PVDF/MAH
blends. These intermolecular interactions may exist between two MAH
molecules or between PVDF and MAH molecules, which are much stronger
than those between two PVDF molecules. In other words, the intermolecular
interactions between PVDF and MAH induce the enhancement of G′ and G″ values. Moreover,
it is worth noting that there is a transition in G′ and G″ values, which is strongly
related to the competition between plasticization and interaction.
With a small amount of MAH, the effect of interaction is dominant,
which enhances the G′ and G″ values. However, with further increase in the MAH content,
the effect of plasticization will be much stronger than that of the
interaction and results in the decrease of G′
and G″ values. In addition, no modulus plateau
is found in the G′ and G″
curves, which means that there are only physical “crosslinking”
points caused by hydrogen bonding in the PVDF/MAH blends, but not
a crosslinking network.

(a) storage modulus
(G′); (b) loss modulus (G″); (c) complex viscosity (|η*|); (d) damping factor
(tan δ); (e) Cole–Cole plots; and (f) Han plots.

Figure 3c shows
the complex viscosity curves of neat PVDF and PVDF/MAH blends. Similar
to the changes of the G′ and G″ values, the |η*| of PVDF/MAH blends first increase
with the incorporation of MAH (0.5–5 wt %) and then decrease
with further increase in the MAH content (8–10 wt %). The |η*|
values of all PVDF/MAH blends are always higher than that of neat
PVDF in the whole range of frequency (ω) investigated, even
if the MAH content reaches 10 wt %. This is also due to the stronger
interaction in PVDF/MAH blends, which restricts the motion of PVDF
molecular chains. Besides, the |η*| values of neat PVDF and
the PVDF/MAH blends decrease gradually with the increase of the angular
frequency, especially in the high-frequency region, which is consistent
with the shear-thinning phenomenon of non-Newtonian fluids.

The tan δ values against angular frequency curves of PVDF
and PVDF/MAH blends are exhibited in Figure 3d. It is reported that the tan δ
curve is an effective way to detect irreversible changes in polymers.22 The curve crest value of neat PVDF appeared
at the vicinity of 0.02 rad s–1, which shifts to
relatively lower frequencies with the incorporation of MAH. This result
indicates the existence of stronger intermolecular interactions and
greater obstruction of molecular movement in PVDF/MAH binary blends.
Similar to the variation of modulus and viscosity, the tan δ
first increases with the increasing MAH content, and then decreases
significantly with further increase in the MAH content, especially
in the low-frequency region. This result also indicates that there
is a competitive relation between plasticization and interaction.

The Cole–Cole plot is an effective method to detect the
phase-separation behavior of two-phase blends by characterizing the
relaxation behavior of polymers, which can eliminate the frequency
dependence of viscosity.23 Generally speaking,
if the two-phase polymer has good compatibility, the Cole–Cole
curve will have a smooth semicircle shape, corresponding to a long
relaxation process. The Cole–Cole plots of neat PVDF and various
PVDF/MAH blends are shown in Figure 3e. Almost all samples are fitted well to a semicircle,
indicating that the PVDF/MAH blend is a homogeneous system. The radius
of the semicircle increases with the incorporation of MAH and reaches
a maximum when the MAH content is 5 wt %, and then decreases with
further increase in the MAH content (8–10 wt %). The radius
of blends is always larger than that of neat PVDF. These results are
in good agreement with the results of modulus and viscosity. It can
be inferred that the relaxation time is related to the molecular weight
and the intermolecular interactions. With the incorporation of MAH,
a small amount of MAH (0.5–5 wt %) acts as a physical “crosslinking”
point between PVDF molecular chains, leading to a longer relaxation
time, which induces an enlarged radius of Cole–Cole plots.
Once the MAH content reaches more than 8 wt %, the excess MAH acts
as the plasticizer, promoting the motion of PVDF molecular chains,
and results in a shorter relaxation time.

The compatibility
of polymer–polymer or polymer–nanofiller
is often confirmed by a Han plot, which is drawn from log G′ to log G″. For
compatible blends, the Han plot usually shows an independent dependence
on components, while for incompatible blends, there is a significant
dependence on the content of components.24 As shown in Figure 3f, compared to neat PVDF, it is worth noting that the Han plot curves
of PVDF/MAH blends do not change significantly with the incorporation
of MAH, indicating that PVDF and MAH have good compatibility.

2.4 Thermal Behaviors of the PVDF/MAH Blends
2.4.1 Glass-Transition Behaviors
The
glass-transition behaviors of the blends can be used to infer the
compatibility of the two substances.25,26 Generally
speaking, the two components are considered to be thermodynamically
miscible with only one glass-transition temperature in their blends.
As shown in Figure 4a,b, the loss tangent (tan δ) and storage modulus (G′) of neat PVDF and the PVDF/MAH blends were measured
by the dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) as functions of temperature.
The microstructure of crystalline polymers (taking PVDF as an example)
consists of a crystalline lamellar phase, an amorphous phase, and
a crystal–amorphous interface, which correspond to three distinct
relaxations of neat PVDF in DMA, respectively.27−29 First, the
relaxation resulting from the motion of the molecular segments in
the amorphous region at low temperature (−35 °C) is corresponding
to the Tg of PVDF. Second, the intermediate
relaxation is usually relatively weaker than the other two relaxations,
which is caused by the motion of the molecular chains at the amorphous–crystal
interface. Lastly, Mijovic et al. believed that various defects in
PVDF crystals result in the relaxation at high temperatures (between
90 and 110 °C).27Figure 4a shows that the Tg of neat PVDF is −38.4 °C,
which initially increases with the addition of MAH (less than 5 wt
% MAH) to −28.2 °C for the sample with 5 wt % MAH, and
then decreases drastically to −33.2 °C with 10 wt % MAH.
The corresponding Tg as a function of
the MAH content is shown in Figure 4c. According to SEM observations and SAOS results,
MAH shows good miscibility with the PVDF matrix. It can be inferred
that the increase of Tg may be a result of the strong interactions between the PVDF matrix
and MAH, which restrict the motion of the PVDF chain segment, while
a large amount of MAH has a plasticizing effect on the PVDF matrix,
leading to the decrease of Tg. With the
incorporation of a small amount of MAH, the relaxation temperature
of the amorphous–crystal interface shifts to a lower temperature
gradually; meanwhile, the intensity increases significantly compared
to that of the neat PVDF. This means that MAH is expelled out from
the gallery of PVDF lamellae and located in the amorphous regions
during the crystallization of PVDF. As depicted in Figure 4b, the storage modulus (G′) increases first and then decreases rapidly; the
strong interaction between the PVDF matrix and MAH and the plasticizing
effect of MAH on the PVDF can be proven again.

and PVDF/MAH blends: (a) loss tangent; (b)
storage modulus as a function of temperature; (c) Tg as a function of the MAH content obtained from (a).

2.4.2 Thermal Stability of the PVDF/MAH Blends
The thermal stability of PVDF and PVDF/MAH blends with different
MAH contents is measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown
in Figure 5. It is
well-known that MAH is a volatile monomer with poor thermal stability,
and the initial degradation temperature (T5%) is 67.0 °C. The thermal stability of neat PVDF is much better
than that of MAH, according to the higher T5% (470.5 °C) of neat PVDF as shown in Figure 5 and Table 1. The blends have two separate degradation steps, corresponding
to the thermal degradations of MAH and PVDF, respectively. MAH shows
a low thermal stability and degrades at lower temperatures, while
the degradation of PVDF occurs at a relatively higher temperature.
The DTG curves show that when the MAH content in the blend is less
than 2 wt %, the MAH degradation can be negligible. This demonstrates
again that the PVDF matrix shows good compatibility with MAH. On further
increasing the MAH content, the degradation process of MAH can be
observed. The weight loss percentage of MAH in the blends is slightly
lower than the amount we added. Besides, due to the good compatibility
of PVDF and MAH and the strong interaction between them, the thermal
stability of MAH in the blend increased significantly. The detailed
TGA parameters are summarized in Table 1.

blends.

PVDF/MAH,90-10	190.0	505.9	503.6	
neat-MAH	67.0	102.4	114.5	
2.4.3 Crystallization and Melting Behaviors
Enthalpy of melting in the first heating scan and the nonisothermal
crystallization exotherm in the first cooling scan of PVDF and PVDF/MAH
blends are recorded in Figure 6. The crystallization temperature (Tc) and melting temperature (Tm)
of PVDF used in this study are 140.9 °C and 175.2 °C, respectively.
It is obvious that the MAH has a significant impact on the crystallization
and melting behaviors of PVDF. First, we can find that the Tm of PVDF decreases remarkably with the increase
of the MAH content, indicating that PVDF and MAH have a good compatibility.
This result is consistent with the SEM observations and SAOS results. Second, a multiple
melting behavior is present in all samples, which can be attributed
to the thickness of the lamella, the crystal form, and the regularity
of the crystal. The incorporation of MAH will not change the crystal
form of PVDF (which will be proved in the following X-ray diffraction
(XRD) studies); it can be assumed that the multiple melting behaviors
result from crystal lamellae with different thicknesses due to the
quick cooling process of PVDF. Third, the Tc decreases with increasing MAH content in PVDF/MAH blends. The Tc of PVDF/MAH blends with a small amount of
MAH (0.5–2 wt %) is higher than the Tc of the neat PVDF, which might be attributed to MAH’s
nucleation of PVDF crystallization. However, the Tc decreases drastically with a large
amount of MAH (5–10 wt %) in the PVDF matrix, which might result
from the diluting effects of a large amount of MAH on the PVDF molecular
chain and the plasticizing effect of MAH might be another reason.
The crystallinity of PVDF in all of the samples (χc) was determined by eq 1 as follows: 1  ΔHm0 is the theoretical enthalpy value
of the 100% crystalline polymer matrix. (the ΔHm0 of PVDF
is 104.7 J g–1) and ⌀ is the weight fraction
of the PVDF matrix (Table 2).

2.5 Crystal Form of PVDF, MAH, and the PVDF/MAH
Blends
PVDF is a typical semicrystalline polymer with three
major crystal forms, which are the α-, β-, and γ-phases.30−33 α-PVDF is more common and stable and usually arises when PVDF
crystallizes under motionless conditions from the melt. β-PVDF
and γ-PVDF exhibit excellent piezoelectric and pyroelectric
properties and ferroelectric activity because of their high polarity.30 To verify the impact of MAH on the crystal form
of PVDF, the XRD spectra of PVDF and PVDF/MAH binary blends are shown
in Figure 7. It is
clear that four characteristic diffraction peaks can be observed in
neat PVDF at 2θ = 17.5, 18.1, 19.8, and 26.4°, corresponding
to the (100), (020), (110), and (021) reflections of the α-phase
crystal, respectively. This means that the α-phase crystal plays
a dominant role in neat PVDF.31 With the
incorporation of MAH, no crystal form transformation occurs in PVDF/MAH
binary blends, indicating that MAH has no effect on the PVDF crystal
form. It is reported that if two materials have low compatibility,
each material would have its own crystal regions in the blends.32 From Figure 7, this case did not occur in the PVDF/MAH blends. After
incorporating MAH (0.5–10 wt %) into the PVDF matrix, no characteristic
MAH peaks were observed in the patterns of PVDF/MAH blends.

of neat PVDF, MAH, and the PVDF/MAH blends.

3 Discussion
3.1 Interactions between PVDF and MAH
MAH usually acts as a plasticizer, a diluent for polymers, which
has been reported in various studies. The decrease of the modulus,
viscosity, Tg, and strength would be carried
out with the incorporation of MAH into the polymer matrix. However,
it is interesting that the incorporation of MAH can greatly enhance
the modulus, viscosity, and mechanical properties of PVDF. We consider
that MAH playsthe role of physically connecting the PVDF molecular
chains in the melt or the amorphous region.

Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is an effective method to detect the
detailed crystal forms and the possible interactions between components.
The FTIR spectroscopy results of neat PVDF, MAH, and PVDF/MAH blends
with different MAH contents are shown in Figure 8. The characteristic absorption bands of
the nonpolar α-phase PVDF are observed at 409, 532, 615, 763,
855, 975, and 1382 cm–1,34 as shown in Figure 8a. Besides, the absorption peak positions and absorption intensity
of PVDF in PVDF/MAH with different compositions are similar to those
of neat PVDF, indicating that the incorporation of MAH has no significant
effect on the crystal structure of PVDF. To define the possible interactions
between PVDF and MAH, more detailed analyses have been carried out.
The absorption peaks observed at 481 and 512 cm–1 are related to the bending and wagging vibrations of CF2, respectively, and the 840 cm–1 bend corresponds
to the CF2 asymmetric stretching vibration.5,35 The vibrational bend near 845 cm–1 is related
to the CH2 rocking vibration of PVDF, which shifts to lower
wavelengths in all PVDF blends,36 as shown
in Figure 8b. Compared
with neat PVDF, several new absorption peaks are observed in the FTIR
spectrum of the PVDF/MAH blend, such as the bands at 1857 and 1783
cm–1, which are related to the asymmetric stretching
and symmetric stretching of the carbonyl group (C=O) in MAH,
respectively.17 In particular, Figure 8c shows that the
asymmetric stretching of the carbonyl group (C=O) shifts to
the lower-wavelength side in all PVDF/MAH blends, in comparison with
neat MAH. According to these results, it can be inferred that the
shift is a result of the intermolecular interaction between the carbonyl
group of MAH and the CH2 group of PVDF; in other words,
this specific interaction is mainly attributed to hydrogen bonding
between the MAH carbonyl oxygen and the PVDF protons.

PVDF, MAH, and PVDF/MAH blends with different
MAH contents. (a) Full spectra of neat PVDF and PVDF/MAH blends with
different MAH contents. (b) Enlarged spectra of the CH2 rocking vibration of PVDF. (c) Enlarged spectra of the C=O
asymmetric stretching of MAH.

According to the FTIR results, the effects of MAH
on the miscibility
and physical and rheological properties of PVDF/MAH blends can be
assigned to the specific interactions between the carbonyl group of
MAH and the CH2 group of PVDF. When the MAH content is
in the range of 0.5–5 wt %, the CH2 groups of PVDF
interact with the carbonyl groups of MAH in the melt state. One MAH
molecule contains two carbonyl groups and can act as a physical crosslinking
point between neighboring PVDF molecular chains, as shown in Figure 9. This not only leads
to the good compatibility between PVDF and MAH, but also enhances
the modulus, viscosity, and mechanical properties of the PVDF matrix.
Taking into account the DMA and rheological property results above,
the value of the modulus and viscosity reaches a maximum at 5 wt %
MAH content, which means that the highest physical crosslink points
were achieved. The strong interactions between PVDF and MAH will impede
the movement of PVDF molecular chains in the melt, and so the PVDF/MAH
blends show an enhanced storage modulus and viscosity in the melt.
At the same time, the physical crosslink also occurs in the amorphous
region of PVDF at room temperature, and so an increased Tg was observed with the addition of MAH. Moreover, the
physical crosslinking functions enhance the ductility of PVDF and
lead to the increased elongation at break with the a higher break
strength.

and MAH.

4 Conclusions
In this work, PVDF/MAH
blends were prepared by a simple melt-blending.
The miscibility, physical properties, and specific hydrogen-bonding
interaction were systematically studied. According to FTIR results,
it can be concluded that the strong specific interaction relates to
the hydrogen bonding involving the carbonyl group of MAH and the CH2 group of PVDF. This strong interaction has a significant
effect on the structure and properties of the binary PVDF/MAH blends.
We conclude that hydrogen bonding is the major driving force for the
compatibility of PVDF and MAH. On the other hand, the storage modulus
and viscosity of PVDF increase with the incorporation of a small amount
of MAH and decrease with further increase in the MAH content. The
enhancement of the modulus and viscosity is due to the two carbonyl
groups of one MAH, which interact with the free CH2 group
of neighboring PVDF molecular chains. In other words, MAH acts as
a physical crosslinking point between neighboring PVDF molecular chains,
improving the mechanical properties of PVDF.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Materials
The PVDF used in this work
was supplied by Hangzhou Fumo new materials technology Co., Ltd.,
China, with an Mn of 98,000 g mol–1. MAH was purchased from Shanghai Zhanyun Chemical
Co., Ltd., China, with the A.R. level, and used as received.

5.2 Preparation of the PVDF/MAH Binary Blends
PVDF and MAH were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h
to remove excrescent water before melt-blending. The melt-blending
of PVDF and MAH was carried out at 190 °C using a batch mixer
(Haake Polylab QC) with an initial rotation speed of 20 rpm (2 min)
and subsequently increased to 50 rpm (5 min).

5.3 Characterization
Scanning electron
microscopy(SEM, Hitachi S-4800) was applied to observe the microstructure
of the fractured surface of samples at the acceleration voltage of
3 kV. All samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen, and the cross-sectional
areas were coated with a thin layer of gold before observation.

The crystallization and melting behaviors of all samples were measured
by differential scanning calorimetry(DSC, TA-Q200) under a nitrogen
atmosphere. Samples were heated from room temperature to 220 °C
and kept for 5 min to eliminate the thermal history, followed by cooling
to 30 °C, and heated to 220 °C again with a heating/cooling
rate of 10 °C min–1.

The thermal stability
of all samples was assessed by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA, TA-Q500) under a nitrogen atmosphere. All samples were
heated from 30 to 650 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1.

The loss tangent (tan δ) and
storage modulus (G′) were measured by dynamic
mechanical analysis
(DMA, TA-Q800) with a multifrequency strain mode. All samples were
heated from −70 to 190 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C
min–1.

Rheological studies of the sample were
performed with a physical
rheometer (MCR301). The samples were set between two parallel-plate
geometries with a plate diameter of 20 mm. The dynamic frequency sweep
experiments were carried out at 200 °C with a strain (γ)
of 5%. The circular frequencies were determined from 0.01 to 500 rad
s–1 and the thickness of the flake-like specimen
was 1 mm.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was
carried out
in the transmittance mode at room temperature with an FTIR spectrometer
(Bruker Vertex 70V). The film samples were scanned at a resolution
of 2 cm–1 in the range of 4000–400 cm–1.

The crystalline structures of the samples
were studied by X-ray
diffractometry(XRD, Bruker-D8). The XRD data were collected in 2θ
from 5 to 40° with a step interval of 0.02°. The scanning
speed was 1° min–1.

Tensile tests were
performed on a universal materials testing machine
(Instron, model 5966) with a tensile speed of 10 mm min–1 at room temperature. Dumbbell-shaped samples were punched out from
the molded sheets based on the ASTM D 412-80 test method.
