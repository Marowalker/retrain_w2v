production cycle of greenhouse-grown crops, large quantities of residual
biomass are discarded. Here, we propose a new value chain to utilize
horticultural leaf biomass for the extraction of secondary metabolites.
To increase the secondary metabolite content of leaves, greenhouse-grown

basis of the positive interdisciplinary evaluation, we identified
opportunities and challenges for the successful establishment of horticultural
leaf biomass as a novel source for secondary metabolites.

Introduction
As the world’s
demand on food, feed, and fuel is increasing, novel approaches are
needed to enhance the resource efficiency of food production systems.1 Bioeconomic approaches aim to develop novel processes
that exploit currently underutilized by-products of agricultural and
horticultural food production.2 In the
case of tomato, the most widely grown vegetable in Europe and the
U.S., about 33 kg of leaf and stem biomass per 100 kg of harvested
tomatoes accrue during and at the end of the growing period.3 Although stem biomass contributes to about 70%
of the residual green biomass after the last fruit harvest, each tomato
plant yields about 0.75 kg of leaf biomass, resulting in about 15
t ha–1 (Mauricio Hunsche, personal communication).
The large quantities of residual plant biomass generated by horticultural
food production are currently either utilized for the production of
biofuel or compost or are disposed with costs.4,5

Recently, cultivated solanaceous crop species including tomato have
been shown to contain significant amounts of secondary metabolites.6,7 In plants, secondary metabolites are involved in the protection
against abiotic and biotic stresses and, correspondingly, their biosynthesis
is often enhanced under stress conditions.8,9 Due
to their beneficial properties for human health, many plant secondary
metabolites are also utilized as dietary food supplements and phytomedicines
and in cosmetics.10 Chemically, secondary
metabolites exhibit enormous diversity and complexity, which makes
their industrial chemical synthesis difficult and expensive.11 To enhance resource efficiency, many agricultural,
horticultural, and food processing by-products have been investigated
as sources for valuable secondary metabolites.12−14

Tomato
leaves contain high amounts of phenolic compounds such as flavonoids,
which have antioxidant and health-promoting properties.15 The flavonoid rutin is of high interest for
industrial applications, as it is used as a food supplement, in functional
foods and cosmetics, and exhibits pharmacological activities.16 Dried tomato leaves contain about 0.8–3.1
0.6 g kg–1 rutin.17−19 Nitrogen deficiency,
low temperatures, and increased light intensities have been shown
to induce the accumulation of rutin and other phenolic compounds in
leaves of tomato plants.18,20 Nitrogen deficiency
is applicable in commercial production of greenhouses but has so far
only been investigated to enhance the secondary metabolite content
of fruits or medicinal plants.21 Further
abiotic stresses that could be applied to selectively trigger plant
secondary metabolism include, e.g., drought,8,22 osmotic
stress by application of salt,23 spraying
of growth regulators,24 and changes in
growing temperature by passive cooling or warming due to increased/reduced
ventilation.25 Depending on the available
greenhouse technology, active regulation of growing temperature and
increased irradiation by growth lights are possible but associated
with costs.25 Abiotic stress treatments
of greenhouse-grown crop plants like tomato after the last fruit harvest
have the potential to induce the accumulation of secondary metabolites
in leaves. By the proposed timing at the end of the annual production
cycle, leaf biomass would be valorized for the extraction of secondary
metabolites like rutin without interfering with fruit quality and
yield. Typically, greenhouses in temperate climate zones are unused
for a short time of a year, when costs for heating of the greenhouses
are increasing and low light conditions further reduce the potential
benefit of fruit production.26 The exposure
of residual postharvest crop plants to low-cost stress treatments,
which increase the secondary metabolite content of leaf biomass and
make it suitable for the extraction of valuable secondary metabolites,
could thus make use of the winter gap.

Establishment of tomato
leaf biomass for the production of rutin requires targeting of industrial
extraction procedures toward this novel source. Analytical extraction
procedures for rutin employing modern extraction techniques like ultrasound-
or microwave-assisted extraction have been established for several
plant species.27 Industrial extraction
methods based on conventional industrial extraction methods such as
solid–liquid extraction by maceration, immersion, or percolation
have been mostly developed for buckwheat biomass, which is the major
source for rutin in food supplements.28 Typically, dried crushed plant material is used and extracts are
purified by crystallization.29 To establish
tomato leaves as a novel source, the extraction efficiency for rutin
must be maximized while cost- and energy inputs as well as environmental
impact are minimized.30 The key parameter
for efficient extraction is the selection of a solvent with high solubility
for rutin that pertains to the regulatory framework of the target
market, which includes various organic solvents.16,27 Additionally, the extraction method, biomass pretreatment, and particle
size must be optimized on the basis of the extraction kinetics of
small-scale industrial-like extractions and an extraction time must
be determined, which maximizes the space–time yield.31 To foster the sustainability of the extraction
process, energy costs, extraction time, and solvent input should be
minimized.

To establish a novel value chain that valorizes residual
biomass for the extraction of secondary metabolites, the process must
be practically feasible, economically viable, and accepted by actors
of the value chain.12,32 As there is an increasing interest
in secondary metabolites as food supplements, which is, e.g., indicated
by a growing number of patented food supplements using rutin as an
ingredient,33 the valorization of tomato
leaf biomass could open up new market opportunities for companies
in the food supplement sector. Nevertheless, the proposed process
requires adjustments to the conventional agri-food value chain. Value
chain actors need to face and overcome emerging challenges associated
with the implementation of novel practices.34 Therefore, an explorative analysis of factors easing or hindering
the feasibility and acceptance of rutin extraction from tomato leaf
biomass along the whole emerging value chain from tomato farmers to
the supplemental food industry and eventually consumers becomes pivotal.

This study proposes a novel value chain for the production of secondary
metabolites from leaf biomass of solanaceous plants: residual plants
after the last annual fruit harvest are subjected to low-cost abiotic
stress treatments, which induce the accumulation of secondary metabolites
in leaf biomass. As proof of concept, we assessed the feasibility
of the proposed value chain for the extraction of rutin from leaf
biomass of nitrogen-deficient tomato plants. We analyzed the plasticity
of foliar rutin levels in young tomato plants, the applicability of
nitrogen deficiency stress in commercial greenhouses, a noninvasive
estimation of rutin content in leaf biomass, the extractability of
rutin from tomato leaf biomass, and the acceptance by actors along
the value chain. By this interdisciplinary approach, we identified
the key factors for the successful implementation of the proposed
value chain, which has the potential to valorize residual leaf biomass
and thus enhance resource efficiency in horticultural food production.

Results
and Discussion
Accumulation of Rutin in Young Tomato Plants
as a Prerequisite To Valorize Leaf Biomass
The key idea of
the proposed value chain is to enhance the value of the residual horticultural
biomass by an inexpensive stress treatment that induces the accumulation
of secondary metabolites. As a proof of concept, we selected the extraction
of rutin from tomato biomass, due to its known plasticity in response
to nitrogen deficiency.18,20,35 We suggest that only secondary metabolites should be considered
for the proposed value chain, which fulfill the following criteria:
(1) presence in relatively high amounts in leaf biomass, (2) strong
induction by abiotic stresses, and (3) increasing accumulation in
response to abiotic stresses, without degradation under extreme stress.
To validate the suitability of rutin, we conducted an experiment with
young tomato plants in response to nitrogen deficiency in combination
with increased light intensities and/or chilling temperatures, which
proved most efficient to induce foliar rutin content in an earlier
study.36 We further extended the duration
of the stress period to investigate if rutin steadily accumulates
or degrades under extreme stress. One month old control plants showed
stable rutin content of 0.6 g kg–1 per leaf dry
weight (DW, Figure 1a). Induction of the foliar rutin content by nitrogen deficiency,
especially in combination with increased light intensity, was observed
starting 4 days after nitrogen depletion of the substrate and lead
to a steady accumulation of 0.2–0.3 g kg–1 DW per day. Tomato plants exposed to nitrogen deficiency, increased
light intensities, and chilling temperatures showed highest foliar
rutin levels, with a maximum of 5.8 g kg–1 DW at
the end of the stress treatment. The observed 10-fold induction exceeds
the 2–5-fold increases observed in earlier studies.18,20

chilling temperatures compared to control plants. (a) Foliar rutin

the mean of N = 4 plants [±standard deviation
(SD)]. Significant differences of stress to control plants [p < 0.05 using one-way-analysis of variance (ANOVA)]
are indicated by asterisks.

The additional inducing effect of increased light intensities was
previously observed20 and can be related
to an increased demand for photoprotection from photooxidative damage,
which is among others mediated by the accumulation of antioxidants
such as rutin.37 In contrast, the effect
of chilling temperatures was negligible, as it was likely only inducing
the flavonoid biosynthesis during acclimation to lower temperatures,
but was not cold enough to significantly affect the flavonoid metabolism.20 Most interesting with regard to the valorization
of leaf biomass is the steady accumulation of rutin with increasing
duration of the stress treatment and thus stress intensity. The antioxidant
capacity of rutin is based on the physical quenching of reactive oxygen
species (ROS). Therefore, rutin is not degraded under oxidative conditions.38 The value of leaf biomass thus increases with
length and intensity of abiotic stress treatments, which should therefore
be performed as long as the farmers’ procedures and schedules
allow. The experiment with young tomato plants thus demonstrates the
potential for the extraction of rutin from nitrogen-deficient tomato
leaf biomass. Likely, other antioxidant secondary metabolites with
physical ROS quenching activity will show a similar accumulation in
response to increasing stress duration and intensity and are thus
promising target metabolites for the valorization of leaf biomass.

Due to the increasing interest in smartphones as simple phenotyping
tools for plant performance in agricultural applications,39 we assessed, if smartphone images reflect stress-related
changes in leaf color. We observed a decrease of the leaf color index
hue in stressed plants from 114° to a minimum of 74° (Figure 1b). This reflects
decreasing chlorophyll content and yellowing of leaves,39,40 which accompanied the increasing rutin levels in response to nitrogen
deficiency (data not shown). In contrast, control plants only showed
a minor decrease of hue from 114 to 96°, which can be attributed
to developmental variation.

Applicability of Abiotic Stress Conditions
in a Production-Like Greenhouse
To evaluate the applicability
of stress treatments in commercial production greenhouses, mature
tomato plants in a commercial-like greenhouse were exposed to 3 week
stress treatments, which would comply with farmer’s schedules
at the end of the annual horticultural production cycle. In addition
to nitrogen deficiency, a complete nutrient deficiency by watering
with tap water was included, as premixed fertilizers in many production
greenhouses hamper the application of nitrogen deficiency without
changes in other nutrients.41

Young
leaves showed a small but significant induction of rutin content in
response to both stress treatments, while rutin levels of mature leaves
were unaffected (Figure 2a). Young leaves of control plants had 3.4 g kg–1 rutin in the dry leaf biomass, while nitrogen and nutrient-deficient
plants contained 5.3 and 4.8 g kg–1, respectively.
The lower induction compared with the experiment with young tomato
plants despite a longer stress treatment indicates that mature plants,
which had a height of 5–6 m, were able to compensate the nitrogen/nutrient
deficiency of the substrate by reallocation of nitrogen from stems
and old leaves.42 Generally, lower foliar
rutin content of 2.0 g kg–1 in mature leaves might
be related to their lower light exposure compared with young leaves
of the upper canopy. The rutin-inducing effect of increased light
intensities was observed in the experiment with young tomato plants
and previous experiments.20,38 In addition, young
leaves may have a higher demand for antioxidant compounds, which has
also been seen in young buckwheat leaves.37 The relatively higher importance of young leaves for plant growth
may also contribute to the stronger induction of rutin in young compared
with mature leaves, which were closer to senescence. To analyze the
total secondary metabolite content of residual crop plants, future
studies should investigate the secondary metabolite of the total leaf
biomass or even within a gradient across plants, to assess the accumulation
of secondary metabolites in leaves of all ages.

Figure 2 Effect of stress treatments
in greenhouse-grown mature tomato plants after a 21 day stress period
of nitrogen deficiency and nutrient deficiency compared with control
plants. (a) Foliar rutin content per leaf dry weight (DW, g kg–1). (b) Leaf color assessed by smartphone image analyses
(hue). Data represent mean of N = 5 plants (±SD).
Significant differences of stressed to control plants (p < 0.05 using one-way-ANOVA) are indicated by asterisks.

The observed stress response is reflected by changes
in hue of leaves from 98 to 89° in response to both stress treatments
only in young leaves, while the hue of mature leaves remained unchanged
at about 91° (Figure 2b). The relatively lower change in leaf color compared with
young plants fits the observed lower stress levels of the mature plants.

Altogether, the nitrogen deficiency treatment does not seem suitable
to induce stress in mature tomato plants, as the induction of foliar
rutin content is rather low. Therefore, the increased rutin content
is likely insufficient to compensate for the costs of the stress treatment.
Increased light intensities by supplemental lighting may induce a
stronger accumulation of rutin, but the operation of light-emitting
diode-panels in commercial greenhouses is costly and energy-consuming.
Although the experiment with young tomato plants suggests that longer
stress treatments would increase foliar rutin levels, stress treatments
exceeding 3 weeks will not comply with farmers’ schedules.
Instead, further inexpensive abiotic stresses, such as changes in
growing temperature by passive cooling or warming due to increased/reduced
ventilation, osmotic stress by application of salt23 or desiccation of plants, or spraying of elicitors, should
be evaluated. Here, special focus should be put on a fast stress response,
to maximize induction while minimizing the period, during which the
greenhouse must be operated. Metabolite profiling of such stressed
plants may identify further valuable secondary metabolites of industrial
relevance.

Establishment of Leaf Color Indicators for
Foliar Secondary Metabolite Content
To provide tomato farmers
with a simple phenotyping tool, we tested the suitability of a smartphone
camera to quantify leaf color as an indicator for plant stress. In
both experiments, the increase of foliar rutin levels in response
to nitrogen deficiency was reflected by a decrease of the color parameter
hue (Figure 3). The
rutin content of leaves and hue showed high correlations with R2 = 0.78 in the experiment with young tomato
plants and R2 = 0.48 for young leaves
of greenhouse-grown plants. A correlation for mature leaves cannot
be derived due to the invariability of rutin content. Hue is a suitable
indicator to estimate nitrogen deficiency stress levels, as it is
sensitive to the decreasing chlorophyll content in response to nitrogen
deficiency.39,40 Consequently, it also highly
correlates with rutin levels, although the contribution of rutin to
leaf color is likely very subtle. In addition, hue is largely insensitive
to changes in irradiation, which contributes to a reliable assessment
of leaf color even under variable light conditions.43 The development of a smartphone application provides an
easy-to-use and inexpensive tool, which contributes to the establishment
of abiotic stress treatments in new greenhouse facilities and thus
the successful establishment of the proposed value chain.

Development of an Efficient Industrial-like Extraction of Rutin from
Tomato Leaf Biomass
As a prerequisite for the establishment
of the proposed value chain, secondary metabolites must be efficiently
extracted from leaf biomass. We adapted the extraction of rutin by
immersion, which previously proved efficient for the extraction of
rutin from buckwheat16,29 to tomato leaf biomass, and evaluated
its maximum efficiency. First, solubility for rutin in six possible
solvents that pertain to the European food supplement market was analyzed.
It ranked from 55.8 g kg–1 for ethanol, 51.6 g kg–1 for methanol, 17.8 g kg–1 for isopropyl
alcohol, 3.7 g kg–1 for acetone, 0.6 g kg–1 for ethyl acetate, to a minimum of 0.04 g kg–1 for water (compare Zi et al.44). Ethanol
additionally allows for a green and cost-efficient processing of leaf
biomass, as it can be easily recycled by evaporation.45 The extraction of rutin from dried buckwheat biomass has
been shown to be more efficient when using aqueous solvents,16 which lead to swelling of the dried leaf biomass
and allowed faster diffusion of the solvent into the plant cells.46

We therefore compared the extraction kinetics
of rutin using pure ethanol and 70 vol % ethanol. Pure ethanol extracted
only 51% of the total rutin content as determined by repeated analytical
extractions, while 70% ethanol showed a maximum extraction yield of
89% and exhibited faster extraction kinetics (Figure 4). The yield of the rutin extraction with
70 vol % ethanol saturated after about 2 h, when yield was 81% and
thus only 8% lower compared with an extraction time of 6 h. Therefore,
the extraction time was empirically determined as 2 h to maximize
the space–time yield.47 Subsequently,
yield of the industrial-like extraction from dried tomato leaves with
70 vol % ethanol after 2 h extraction time was confirmed by the analysis
of leaf biomass from four additional plants. The average yield of
the industrial-like extraction from dried leaf material is 87 ±
19% of the repeated analytical extraction of frozen leaf aliquots.
This demonstrates that drying of biomass at 40 °C had only a
minor effect on the foliar rutin content, which facilitates transport
and storage due to reduced biochemical degradation and risk of microbiological
contamination.48

Figure 4 Kinetics of the rutin
extraction from dried tomato leaf material (DW, %). Extraction kinetics
were determined with leaf particles sized 1–1.4 mm in batch
extraction mode at room temperature and related to the total rutin
content determined by repeated analytical extraction of leaf samples
from the same plant frozen immediately after harvest.

Altogether, the developed extraction process for rutin from
tomato leaves is considered cost-efficient, as the one-step extraction
showed high yield. The applied methods are widely available at low
cost for industrial-scale extractions, which contributes to the feasibility
and acceptance of the developed extraction method.49 While extraction processes must be targeted toward a specific
source to maximize its yield, the purification of rutin from tomato
extracts would be comparable to the buckwheat purification process,
which is commonly performed by a crystallization step that recovers
92% of the rutin with a purity of more than 95%.50 When ethanol is evaporated from aqueous extracts, rutin
crystallizes with high purity in water, due to its low solubility
therein.29,51 The mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of rutin
extract from tomato leaves revealed that most side components are
more polar (i.e., early eluting compounds) than rutin (Figure 5a), which indicates a higher
solubility in water and thus later crystallization. Rutin extracts
may further contain low amounts of glycoalkaloids, mainly α-tomatine.51 Due to their insolubility in water, they would
crystallize earlier than rutin or could be removed by additional purification
processes.45 On the other hand, side components
may also be beneficial or of commercial value.17 In our extracts, we identified chlorogenic acid and caffeic
acid (Figure 5b), which
are even enhanced under nitrogen deficiency (Figure 6 and 7). Therefore,
the profitability of the proposed value chain may be enhanced by the
simultaneous extraction of additional valuable metabolites.45

Analysis of Key Factors
for the Establishment of the Proposed Value Chain
The establishment
of horticultural leaf biomass as a novel source of secondary metabolites
requires not only technical feasibility but also acceptance by its
main actors, as additional steps need to be implemented in the existing
horticultural practice, and acceptance by producers and consumers
is pivotal for its successful establishment. Only few bioeconomic
concepts have been incorporated in common practice, and the establishment
of new resources and modification of existing value creation is challenging.2 We therefore complemented our study with an explorative
analysis by expert interviews, to assess the value chain actors’
opinion on both opportunities and challenges of the proposed value
chain and their provisional acceptance. By this interdisciplinary
approach, we aim to identify all key factors necessary to consider
for the establishment of the proposed value chain.

Tomato farmers
confirmed the availability of high amounts of residual leaf biomass
and their willingness to adopt novel practices to valorize these residuals,
e.g., the application of stress treatments and drying of leaf biomass,
when financial incentives are provided. Especially diversified and
innovative farmers perceived the proposed value chain as a business
opportunity to generate additional income. Therefore, subsidies for
the establishment of such novel horticultural practices could further
promote the implementation of the proposed value chain.52

Representatives of food supplement companies
were generally skeptical about horticultural leaf biomass as a source
of secondary metabolites. They were concerned by transportation costs
for leaf biomass, supply security, purity of target components, regulation
and labeling, and price competition with producers in Asia. Transportation
costs of leaf biomass could be reduced by clustering of biomass suppliers,
extraction companies, and producers of food supplements in the same
geographical area.53 Short trade routes
together with the sustainability of the raw materials might provide
an advantage of rutin extracted from tomato leaf biomass compared
with rutin from buckwheat that must be imported from Asia.54 Competitive prices and quality, i.e., high purity
of the metabolites will have a major influence on its acceptance by
the target markets and compliance with European legislation. To enhance
the economic feasibility of the proposed value chain, multiple secondary
metabolites should be purified from tomato plant extracts. Thereby,
general production costs for transport, pretreatment, and extraction
could be distributed across different products and prices are mainly
determined by product specific costs. The increasing market demand
for natural ingredients and marketing of bio-based products as healthy,
ecologically sustainable, and regionally produced were perceived advantageous
for the establishment of the novel value chain. Nevertheless, industry
representatives emphasized that a steady supply of biomass is preferred.
Therefore, leaf biomass gathered during regular pruning of horticultural
plants throughout the growing season, e.g., from tomato and cucumber,
should be further investigated for their secondary metabolite content.
This especially applies to valuable secondary metabolites, which are
abundant in leaf biomass without being induced by stress treatments.

However, on the consumer side, our interviews revealed a general
lack of knowledge about environmental benefits of bio-based ingredients.
This hampers the demand of bio-based products and represents a challenge
for their promotion. On the opposite, health-conscious customers were
interested in purchasing bio-based food supplements due to their natural
and health-promoting ingredients. This is in accordance with earlier
findings, that positive attitudes toward bio-based food supplements
are primarily driven by consumers’ health consciousness and
not by environmental concerns.55 Appropriate
labeling of bio-based ingredients to communicate the beneficial health
effects and/or environmental benefits would help to reach this important
target group and increase consumer awareness.2 However, the current Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation requires
high R&D expenditures from companies to apply health claims associated
with food ingredients.56

Altogether,
secondary metabolites extracted from horticultural biomass have a
high market potential, which is further considered to rise with the
twist of the European Union toward a bio-based economy.2 Rutin was selected as target metabolite for our
study, as it is relatively abundant and highly inducible in tomato
biomass. Nevertheless, with the long treatment duration needed to
induce strong induction of rutin in greenhouse-grown tomato plants
together with a rather low price for rutin extracted from buckwheat,
the valorization of leaf biomass for the extraction of rutin does
not seem economically feasible. To identify potential target metabolites
abundant in tomato leaf biomass and of high commercial value, we combined
a literature analysis of secondary metabolite contents in tomato leaf
biomass with an estimation of their market value (Figure 5). Secondary metabolites abundant
in tomato leaf biomass and of high commercial value, such as solanesol
and chlorogenic acid, are more promising for the establishment of
the proposed value chain compared with rutin. Therefore, further studies
should elucidate the potential for the induction of these metabolites
in residual postharvest crop plants. Nevertheless, the valorization
of leaf biomass will be only profitable when secondary metabolites
are strongly induced by a low-cost stress treatment. Therefore, the
potential of inexpensive abiotic stress treatments or those that trigger
a fast stress response in plants should be further explored. For example,
a 12-fold induction of solanesol was observed in young tomato plants
exposed for 1 week to day temperatures of 28 °C instead of 22
°C.36 Given the low number of studies
on the secondary metabolite content of residual green biomass of horticultural
crop plants, systematic metabolite profiling may reveal further valuable
secondary metabolites.6,57

In conclusion, we identified
key aspects for the utilization of residual leaf biomass for the extraction
of secondary metabolites and the potential to valorize leaf biomass
by abiotic stress treatments. Our interdisciplinary approach to investigate
tomato leaf biomass as a source for the flavonoid rutin serves as
a proof of concept for the potential of the proposed value chain.
We showed strong induction and steady accumulation of rutin in leaves
of young tomato plants but point out challenges in the application
of nitrogen deficiency stress treatments in greenhouses. This limits
the feasibility of the proposed value chain, despite a high efficiency
of industrial-like extraction processes and general market potential
for secondary metabolites derived from horticultural by-products.
Future research should screen for further valuable secondary metabolites
in the leaf biomass of different horticultural crops and if low-cost
abiotic stress treatments can be applied in commercial greenhouses
to substantially induce their content in residual leaf biomass. Thereby,
the potential of horticultural biomass as novel source of secondary
metabolites will be exploited, which contributes to increased sustainability
of the horticultural food production.

Material and Methods
Plants
and Materials Used for Experiments
For both experiments,
tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) from a commercially commonly used line, the truss tomato F1
hybrid Lyterno (Rijk Zwaan Welver GmbH, Welver, Germany), were grown
from seed in the Grodan rockwool substrate (Grodan, Roermond, The
Netherlands).

Inducibility of Rutin Accumulation in Young
Tomato Plants under Controlled Nitrogen Deficiency
The experiment
was conducted in two controlled walk-in environmental chambers with
7.1 m2 growing area and a total volume of 22 m3 each (Hühren Kälte-Klima-Elektrotechnik, Erkelenz,
Germany) at the Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Jülich,
Germany. Plants were randomly distributed among and within both chambers
and grown at 22/18 °C day/night temperature with 10 h day length,
50% relative humidity, and 200 μmol m–2 s–1 photon light intensity using metal halide lamps placed
at a height of 1.95 m. Plants took about 10 days to germinate in rockwool
plugs watered with deionized water. One week after germination, plants
were transferred to 7.5 × 7.5 cm2 rockwool cubes and
fertilized with half-strength Hoagland solution. Two weeks later,
plants were fertilized with full-strength Hoagland solution [5 mM
KNO3, 5 mM Ca(NO3)2, 2 mM MgSO4, 1 mM KH2PO4, 90 μM FeEDTA, plus
micronutrients]. One month after germination, plants were randomly
assigned to four treatment groups (N = 4, in total
96 plants): control, nitrogen deficiency in combination with increased
light intensity, nitrogen deficiency in combination with chilling
temperatures, nitrogen deficiency in combination with increased light
intensity and chilling temperatures. This stress combination is not
transferrable to commercial greenhouse conditions but allowed for
monitoring of rutin contents under severe stress conditions. Nitrogen
deficiency was achieved by washing the rockwool substrate three times
with 0.5 L of modified nitrogen-free Hoagland solution [KNO3 and Ca(NO3)2 were replaced by 2.5 mM K2SO4 and 5 mM CaCl2] and subsequent watering
with nitrogen-free Hoagland solution. For the chilling temperature
treatment, plants were transferred to an identical growth chamber
with the same environmental conditions but set to 20/12 °C day/night
temperature. For the increased light intensity treatment, plants were
positioned closer to the lamps, where they received the doubled light
intensity. At the start of the experiment, plants were about 30 cm
high and had a fresh weight of 11.7 ± 1.8 g and a leaf area of
307 ± 45 cm2. Throughout the experiment, control plants
were about 60 cm high, with a fresh weight of 11.7 ± 1.8 g and
a leaf area of 2340 ± 141 cm2. Stress-treated plants
showed reduced growth, with a fresh weight of 36.4 ± 2.9 g and
a leaf area of 596 ± 64 cm2 at the end of the treatment
(Figure S1). The fourth oldest leaf was
sampled for analyses of the rutin content and immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen 0, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16 days after onset of the stress
treatment. Additionally, the third and fifth leaves were sampled and
dried for 3 days at 80 °C to determine the fresh/dry weight ratio.

Nitrogen and Nutrient Deficiency Experiment with Greenhouse-Grown
Tomato Plants
The applicability of a nitrogen deficiency
treatment in commercial-like greenhouses was tested with mature tomato
plants grown in a commercial-like ridge and furrow type greenhouse
at the Research Campus Klein-Altendorf, Rheinbach, Germany, in a separated
compartment sized 4.6 × 45.0 m2. Seeds were sown in
January 2017 in rockwool cubes and cultivated under supplemental lighting.
Four weeks after sowing, two plants were transferred onto one 1 m
long rockwool slab in an open hydroponic gutter growing system. A
total number of 420 plants was grown in six 35 m long rows, equaling
a density of about 20 000 plants ha–1. The
greenhouse was covered with a single layer of safety glass, and plants
were cultivated under natural light conditions. The temperature regulation
system maintained 20.7 ± 1.9 °C during the day and 18.1
± 0.4 °C at night, with minimum and maximum temperatures
of 17.5 and 25.4 °C, respectively. Computer-controlled drip irrigation
with a standard nutrient solution (17.2 mM N, 5.4 mM Ca, 4.7 mM K,
0.4 mM P, 5.4 mM S, 2.4 mM Mg, 10 μM Fe plus micronutrients)
ensured generous water and nutrient supply. Nitrogen and nutrient
deficiency treatments were started on April 13, when plants were about
2 m tall. Stress treatments were conducted on five rockwool slabs
(with a total number of 10 plants) randomly selected among the inner
four rows excluding slabs at the beginning and end of rows, to minimize
variation in microclimate and irradiation. Each slab was flushed with
60 L of tap water and subsequently watered with a modified nitrogen-free
nutrient solution or tap water, respectively, using a Comfort 9000
watering system (GARDENA GmbH, Ulm, Germany). Equally, control plants
were selected. On May 4, after 3 weeks of deficiency treatments, stress-treated
plants showed comparable stress responses. Therefore, one plant per
slab was sampled, equaling N = 5 plants from the
control, nitrogen deficiency, or nutrient deficiency treatment group.
Intermediate leaflets of mature leaves from the lower plant canopy
and of fully developed young leaves from the upper canopy were immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen. Comparable leaflets were taken to analyze
the fresh/dry weight ratio.

In addition, five untreated tomato
plants were sampled on July 20 for the development of the industrial-like
extraction procedure. All leaves of one plant were pooled and dried
for 4 days at 40 °C. Dried leaf samples were crushed by hand
and sieved to retain different particle sizes. Prior to sampling of
the leaves, small parts of intermediate leaflets of every second leaf
were taken and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Rutin content
of these aliquots was determined by repeated analytical extraction
as reference for the yield of the industrial-like extractions.

Smartphone
Phenotyping To Quantify Leaf Color as an Indicator for Rutin Content
To investigate the potential of smartphones as simple phenotyping
tools to estimate plant stress levels and secondary metabolite content,
every sampled leaf was photographed using a smartphone (FP 1, Fairphone
B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands) equipped with a Sony IMX179 camera
with an 8 megapixel sensor and autofocus. Automatic flash was disabled,
while automatic adjustments of white balance and ISO was kept. Images
of individual leaves together with a gray reference were taken under
room light conditions (mix of natural sunlight and low-pressure mercury-vapor
gas-discharge lamps) from a 30 cm distance in the nadir position.
The software ImageJ was used to select a circular region of interest,
either in the top leaflet of young tomato plants or in the sampled
leaflet of greenhouse-grown tomato plants,40 and extract the mean RGB color as digital numbers (R, G, B; 0–255) with the
function histogram. As color analyses of the gray reference revealed
little variation in illumination, RGB analysis was performed without
further calibration. Hue was calculated as follows 1  

Analytical Extraction of Rutin
To determine the rutin content
of the frozen samples by analytical extractions, a methanol-based
protocol was adapted.58 Prior to the analyses,
frozen leaf samples were ground by hand in liquid nitrogen and stored
at −80 °C. One hundred milligrams of ground leaf material
was extracted with 0.7 mL of pure methanol for 4 h at room temperature
on a shaker (1 × 4 h MeOH). This analytical method proved very
efficient and extracted 95 ± 1% of the total rutin content, which
was determined by repeated extraction with four subsequent extraction
steps with 0.7 mL of methanol for 1 h each and pooling of supernatants
(4 × 1 h MeOH).

Development of an Industrial-like Rutin Extraction
Procedure Targeting Tomato Leaves
In the first step, a suitable
solvent was selected based on the solubilization strength for rutin.
Ethanol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, acetone, ethyl acetate, and
water were tested, as they comply with the requirements of the food
supplement market. Pure rutin (0.1 g, TCI Deutschland GmbH, Eschborn,
Germany) was added to 1 mL of each solvent at 25 °C, with three
technical replicates. After shaking flasks for 24 h, they were centrifuged
for 30 min at 13 500g, and the solubilized
rutin in the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC.

Second, kinetics
for the extraction of rutin from dried tomato leaf material in stirred
batch mode were analyzed to empirically determine an extraction time
that maximizes the space–time yield. In addition to pure ethanol,
which had the highest solubility for rutin, we also investigated the
extraction kinetics of 70 vol % ethanol, as the addition of water
has been shown to improve the extraction kinetics for rutin from plant
material.16 To determine the extraction
kinetics shown in Figure 4, 3 g of dried leaf biomass with a particle size between 1.0
and 1.4 mm, which is typical for industrial-scale extractions from
plant biomass,31 was extracted in 0.2 L
of each solvent, respectively. Offline HPLC samples (0.8 mL of each)
were taken over 6 h at room temperature in stirred batch extraction
mode. On the basis of the superior efficiency of 70 vol % ethanol
and saturation of the extraction after 2 h, these parameters were
chosen for the industrial-like extraction.

Last, the yield of
the industrial-like extraction was determined. One gram of dried leaf
biomass was extracted in 15 mL of 70 vol % ethanol for 2 h for four
plants with three technical replicates and related to the repeated
analytical extraction of aliquots of the same leaves.

Quantification
of Rutin Content in Extracts by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
Rutin concentration of analytical and industrial-like extracts
was quantified using the 1200 Series HPLC (Agilent Technologies Deutschland
GmbH & Co. KG, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a NUCLEODUR 100-3
C18ec reversed phase column (125 mm × 3 mm; Macherey-Nagel
GmbH & Co. KG, Düren, Germany) temperature-controlled at
25 °C. Extracts were filtered using syringe filters [0.2 μm
poly(tetrafluoroethylene), VWR International GmbH, Germany] and diluted
with water to match the isocratic eluent, 40 wt % methanol, and 60
wt % water (pH 2.7 adjusted with phosphoric acid). At a flow rate
of 0.3 mL min–1, rutin eluted 7 min after injection
of 10 μL of the extract using an autosampler and was detected
at 210 nm by a UV detector and quantified according to a standard
(TCI Deutschland GmbH, Eschborn, Germany).

The same method was
applied on a LC-MS-QTOF System (Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH
& Co. KG, Waldbronn, Germany) in electrospray ionization mode
with positive ionization, equipped with a NUCLEODUR 100-5 C18ec column (250 mm × 3 mm; Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG,
Düren, Germany) to investigate side components in an additional
rutin extract from a mature leaf of a 10 month old tomato plant.

Value Chain Analysis Based on Semistructured Expert Interviews with
Key Actors
To economically evaluate the feasibility and competitiveness
of the proposed value chain, the acceptance and opinions of the potential
key actors were assessed in a qualitative research approach. Semistructured
interviews with four tomato farmers, three representatives of the
food supplement industry, and with five consumers addressed (1) the
professional background of the value chain actors; (2) their acceptance
concerning novel farm practices (tomato farmers), using residual leaf
biomass as raw materials (food supplement industry) and bio-based
ingredients in products (consumers); and (3) their perceived opportunities
and challenges of the proposed value chain. The interview length ranged
from 20 to 60 min and participants were predominantly male. The interviews
were transcribed, hand-coded by categories, and analyzed. On the basis
of these interviews, we identified opportunities and challenges of
the proposed value chain.

Market Value Estimation of Secondary Metabolites
To give an outlook about potential secondary metabolites of interest
in tomato leaf biomass, we combined a literature analysis relevant
to secondary metabolites known to be present in tomato leaves with
a market-based analysis of their value. Values of secondary metabolite
contents in tomato leaves were found in the literature.6,7,17,18,57,59 If literature
values were estimated per fresh weight, we assumed a dry weight-to-fresh
weight ratio of 1:9, which we experimentally determined for mature
leaves of control plants grown in the commercial-like greenhouse.
Market values of secondary metabolites in tomato leaves were estimated
by requesting the price for a quantity of 1000 kg of each substance
from international suppliers on the online business-to-business trading
platform alibaba.com in May 2016. Price ranges for each metabolite
were determined based on two to five answers from different retailers.

Statistics
The effects of stress treatments on rutin content
and leaf color were compared by one-way-ANOVA (function aov) performed
with R 3.0.3 followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test (function
TukeyHSD, 95% family-wise confidence level and p <
0.05 level of significance). Homogeneity of variance was validated
using the Levene’s test (function levene from the library car),
and normality of distribution was validated using the Shapiro–Wilk-test
(function shapiro.test). Correlations between leaf color in hue and
foliar rutin content were calculated in Excel, and the best fitting
regression function was chosen among linear, exponential, logarithmic
and polynomial fit.
