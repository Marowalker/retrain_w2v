A bisbinaphthyl
dialdehyde shows greatly enhanced enantioselective
fluorescent response (ef = 10.0) in the fluorescent recognition of
a chiral diamine, 1,2-diphenylethylenediamine, over a previously reported
monobinaphthyl dialdehyde (ef = 1.1). This compound can be used to
determine the enantiomeric composition of the diamine by fluorescence
measurement. The NMR and mass spectroscopic studies have demonstrated
that the chirality matched reaction of the bisbinaphthyl dialdehyde
with the diamine in the presence of Zn(OAc)2 favors the
formation of a macrocyclic product more than the chirality mismatched.
This enantioselective cyclocondensation should contribute to the observed
highly enantioselective fluorescent response because the macrocyclic
Zn(II) complex is proposed to give much greater fluorescence enhancement
than the acyclic ones.

Introduction
Study
of the enantioselective fluorescent response of chiral organic
compounds is both fundamentally interesting and potentially useful.1−3 For example, an enantioselective fluorescent sensor could provide
an analytical method to rapidly assess the enantiomeric composition
of a chiral compound, which can facilitate the high throughput screening
of asymmetric reactions. In the past 2 decades, a significant amount
of research has been conducted in this area and a number of sensitive
as well as enantioselective fluorescent probes have been obtained
for the recognition of various chiral substrates.1−3 In 2014, we
reported the discovery that the 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL)-based
dialdehyde (S)-1 in combination with
Zn(OAc)2 exhibits highly enantioselective fluorescent enhancement
in the presence of a number of chiral functional amines.4 However, when (S)-1+Zn(OAc)2 is used to interact with 1,2-diphenylethylenediamine
(2), there is little enantioselectivity in the observed
fluorescence enhancement (Figure S4). Chiral
diamines have been extensively used in the preparation of chiral ligands
for asymmetric catalysis. Fluorescent probes for the enantioselective
recognition of chiral diamines will be useful for the synthesis and
analysis of these compounds. In order to improve the enantioselectivity
in the fluorescent recognition of the chiral diamine, we have studied
the use of a bisBINOL-based aldehyde and found greatly enhanced enantioselectivity
in the fluorescent recognition of 2. Herein, this result
is reported.

Results and Discussion
Scheme 1 shows the
method we have developed for the synthesis of a bisBINOL aldehyde.
From the reaction of (S)-BINOL, (S)-3, with MOMBr (MOM = CH3OCH2) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), the mono-MOM-protected
compound (S)-4 was obtained in 81% yield.
Treatment of (S)-4 with excess nBuLi at 0 °C followed by warming up
to room temperature and addition of DMF gave the aldehyde product
(S)-5 in 62% yield. Reaction of (S)-5 with 1,4-dibromobutane in the presence
of K2CO3 in refluxing acetonitrile followed
by deprotection with concentrated HCl gave the desired bisBINOL product
(S)-6 in 85% yield.5

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the BisBINOL Aldehyde
We studied the fluorescent response of (S)-6 toward the two enantiomers of the chiral
diamine (R,R)- and (S,S)-2 in the presence of Zn(OAc)2 in DMSO solution.
Compound (S)-6 in DMSO showed a weak
emission signal at λ = 499 nm. When it was treated with Zn(OAc)2 (1.0 equiv), almost no change was observed. However, addition
of (R,R)-2 (2 equiv)
to the solution of (S)-6 + Zn(OAc)2 generated large fluorescence enhancement at λ = 552
nm (Figure 1a). When
(S,S)-2 was used, the
fluorescence enhancement was much smaller than the use of (R,R)-2. The enantiomeric fluorescence
enhancement ratio (ef) is 10.0 (ef = [IRR – I0]/[ISS – I0]. I0: fluorescence intensity of the sensor (S)-6 + Zn(OAc)2. IRR and ISS: fluorescence intensity in the
presence of (R,R)- and (S,S)-2.). Thus, (S)-6 exhibits excellent enantioselectivity in the fluorescent
recognition of this chiral diamine, which is greatly enhanced over
that of the monoBINOL aldehyde (S)-1 (ef = 1.1). Figure 1b shows that the enantioselective fluorescence response of (S)-6 + Zn(OAc)2 at λ = 552
nm maintains while the equivalences of (R,R)- and (S,S)-2 increase.

Figure 1 (a) Fluorescence spectra of (S)-6 (0.050 mM) and Zn(OAc)2 (1 equiv) with addition of the
two enantiomers of 2 (2 equiv) in DMSO. (b) Fluorescence
intensity at λ = 552 nm vs the equivalence of the diamine 2 (λex = 370 nm, slit = 3.0/3.0 nm, reaction
time = 3 h).

We prepared the bisBINOL
compound (R)-6, the enantiomer of (S)-6, from (R)-BINOL. It was
found that (S,S)-2 enhanced
the fluorescence of (R)-6 + Zn(OAc)2 much greater than
(R,R)-2 (Figure S6). This mirror–image relationship
between the fluorescence responses of (R)-6 and (S)-6 confirms the observed enantioselective
recognition.

The fluorescence response of (S)-6 + Zn(OAc)2 toward 2 at various
enantiomeric
composition was studied. As shown in Figure 2, as the amount of (R,R)-2 increases in the mixture of (R,R)-2 and (S,S)-2, the fluorescence intensity of (S)-6 + Zn(OAc)2 at λ = 552
nm increases. This demonstrates that this sensor system can be used
to determine the enantiomeric composition of the chiral diamine.

Figure 2 Fluorescence
intensity of (S)-6 (0.050
mM) and Zn(OAc)2 (1.0 equiv) at λ = 552 nm versus
the enantiomeric composition of 2 (2.0 equiv) in DMSO
(λex = 370 nm, slit = 3.0/3.0 nm, reaction time =
3 h).

In order to gain a better understanding
of the highly enantioselective
fluorescent response of (S)-6, we studied
the 1H NMR spectrum of (S)-6 upon treatment with Zn(OAc)2 and (R,R)- and (S,S)-2. As shown in Figure 3, when (S)-6 was treated with Zn(OAc)2 (1.0 equiv), the 1H NMR signals became a little
broader but have no significant change in the peak positions except
the disappearance of the hydroxyl signal of (S)-6 at δ 10.05 probably because of faster acidic proton
exchange. Addition of (R,R)-2 (2.0 equiv) led to continuous reduction of the aldehyde
signal at δ 10.17 over time, which was accompanied by the growing
of a new peak at δ 8.93. This new peak can be assigned to an
imine proton formed from the condensation of the amine groups of (R,R)-2 with the aldehyde groups
of (S)-6. After 3 h, the aldehyde peak
of (S)-6 almost completely disappeared,
indicating the complete condensation of the aldehyde groups of (S)-6 with the diamine.

Figure 3 1H NMR spectra
of the reaction mixture of (S)-6 (5.0
mM in DMSO-d6,
1.0 equiv) with (R,R)-3 (10.0 mM in DMSO-d6, 2.0 equiv) and
Zn(OAc)2 (5.0 mM in D2O, 1.0 equiv) at various
reaction times.

The mass spectrum of
the above product mixture of (S)-6,
Zn(OAc)2 (1 equiv) and (R,R)-2 (2 equiv) was obtained (Page
S8 in Supporting Information). The base
peak at m/z = 859.35 was observed,
which can be attributed to that of the macrocyclic product 7 (calcd for 7 + H: 859.35) formed from the condensation
of both of the aldehyde groups of (S)-6 with the two amine groups of (R,R)-2. A significant peak at m/z = 921.40 was found for the Zn-complex 8 (calcd
for 8 + H: 921.27).

The 1H NMR
spectra of (S)-6 with Zn(OAc)2 and (S,S)-2 were
also obtained. As shown in Figure 4, the reaction of (S)-6 with Zn(OAc)2 and (S,S)-2 was much less favorable.
There was a significant amount of the aldehyde signals remained after
2–12 h of reaction. The mass spectrum of this reaction mixture
gave the base peak at m/z = 877.37,
which is attributed to that of 9 (calcd for 9 + H: 877.36) formed from the reaction of only one of the aldehyde
groups of (S)-6 with the diamine (Page
S9 in Supporting Information). Signals
corresponding to compounds such as 7 and 8 were also observed but at lower intensities than that of 9. Thus, the condensation of (S)-6 with
(S,S)-2 to form the
macrocyclic product 7 and 8 is not as efficient
as that with (R,R)-2, which can be attributed to a mismatched chiral configuration between
the two compounds. That is, the chiral configurations of the amino
unit and the BINOL units in 9 can strongly influence
its intramolecular condensation to form the corresponding macrocycle.

Figure 4 1H NMR spectra of the reaction mixture of (S)-6 (5.0 mM in DMSO-d6,
1.0 equiv) with (S,S)-2 (10.0 mM in DMSO-d6, 2.0 equiv) and
Zn(OAc)2 (5 mM in D2O, 1.0 equiv) at various
reaction times.

On the basis of the above
NMR and mass spectroscopic analyses,
we can propose the following explanation for the observed enantioselective
fluorescent recognition of the chiral diamine by the bisBINOL sensor.
When (S)-6 is treated with (R,R)-2 and Zn(OAc)2, formation of the macrocyclic Zn(II) complex 8 is observed.
Coordination of the imine nitrogens of 8 with the Zn(II)
center can inhibit the excited state proton transfer between the hydroxyl
group and the imine nitrogen6 as well as
the excited state isomerization of the imine double bond,7 both of which can enhance the fluorescence of
the compound. In addition, the rigidity of the macrocycle structure
of 8 should play a very important role for the greatly
enhanced fluorescence. In contrast, when (S)-6 is treated with (S,S)-2, the opposite enantiomer of the diamine, much lower fluorescence
enhancement was observed, which could be attributed to the less-favorable
cyclocondensation of 9 to form 7 and 8. That is, the mismatched chiral configuration of (S)-6 with (S,S)-2 is not as favorable as that with (R,R)-2 for the formation of the macrocycle.

In conclusion, we have discovered that the bisBINOL aldehyde (S)-6 shows greatly enhanced enantioselectivity
in the fluorescent recognition of a chiral diamine over the monoBINOL
aldehyde (S)-1. This compound can be
used to determine the enantiomeric composition of the diamine by fluorescence
measurement. The NMR and mass spectroscopic studies have revealed
that the reaction of (S)-6 with the
chiral diamine to form a macrocyclic product is enantioselective,
which leads to the enantioselective fluorescent response. This study
provides new insight to design enantioselective fluorescent sensors.

Experimental
Section
General Data
All reactions were carried out under N2 unless otherwise noted. All chemicals were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. or Alfa Aesar. HPLC grade DMSO was used
without purification. NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian-600 MHz
spectrometer. A Horiba FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer was used to
acquire the steady-state fluorescence emission spectra. The University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Synapt G2SiMass Spectrometry
Facility was used to acquire the high and low resolution mass spectra.

Synthesis and Characterization of Compounds (S)-6
(1) To a solution of (S)-3 (2.86 g, 10 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (30 mL),
DIPEA was added (2.84 g, 22 mmol) at 0 °C, and the
mixture was stirred for 3 h. Then, bromomethyl methyl ether (1.87
g, 15 mmol) was added at 0 °C and stirred for 30 min at the same
temperature. The reaction was quenched by addition of 2 M-HCl at 0
°C and extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined
organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue
was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel eluted with hexane/acetone
(20/1) to give (S)-4 as a white solid
in 81% yield. (2) Under nitrogen, n-BuLi (4.2 mL,
10.5 mmol, 2.5 M solution in hexanes) was added dropwise into a solution
of (S)-4 (990 mg, 3.0 mmol) in anhydrous
tetrahydrofuran (THF; 40 mL) at 0 °C. The resulting mixture was
stirred at room temperature for 2 h, and then, DMF (4.5 mmol, 0.36
mL) was added dropwise. After stirred for 3 h, the reaction was quenched
with saturated aqueous NH4Cl, and extracted with methylene
chloride. The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced
pressure. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica
gel eluted with hexane/acetone (10/1) to give (S)-5 as a yellow solid in 62% yield. (3) To a solution of (S)-5 (895 mg, 2.5 mmol) in acetonitrile (30
mL), K2CO3 (828 mg, 6 mmol) and 1,4-dibromobutane
(215 mg, 1 mmol) were added. The mixture was heated and stirred at
reflux for 24 h. The solvent was then evaporated, and the residue
was extracted with ethyl acetate. After removal of ethyl acetate,
the combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure.
The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel eluted
with hexane/acetone (5/1) to give a yellow solid in 75% yield. This
compound was then dissolved in THF (25 mL), to which concentrated
aqueous HCl (32 w/w %, 5.0 mL) was added at 0 °C. After the reaction
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h, the solvent was removed
under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in methylene chloride, which
was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and dried over
anhydrous Na2SO4. After filtration and concentration
under vacuum, the residue was purified by flash column chromatography
on silica gel eluted with hexane/acetone (5/1) to give (S)-6 as a yellow solid in 85% yield (725 mg). 1H NMR (600 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 10.23

Preparation of Samples
for Fluorescence Measurements
Stock solutions of 5 mM (S)-1 or (S)-6 and 10 mM 1,2-diphenylethylenediamine
in DMSO and 5 mM Zn(OAc)2 in H2O were freshly
prepared for each measurement. In the fluorescence enhancement study,
the 1,2-diphenylethylenediamine and Zn(OAc)2 solutions
with the designated equivalences were added to a 5 mL test tube, which
was followed by the addition of the (S)-1 or (S)-6 stock solution. The total
volume was maintained at 1 mL with the use of additional DMSO. After
the solution was allowed to react at room temperature for 3 h, it
was diluted to 5 mL with the addition of DMSO, unless otherwise noted.

Preparation of Samples for NMR Measurements
Stock solutions
of 5.0 mM (S)-6 and 10.0 mM 1,2-diphenylethylenediamine
in DMSO-d6 and 5.0 mM Zn(OAc)2 in D2O were freshly prepared for NMR measurement. In
the NMR study, the 1,2-diphenylethylenediamine (2.0 equiv) and Zn(OAc)2 (1.0 equiv) solutions were combined in a NMR tube to which
the solution of (S)-6 (1.0 equiv) was
added.
