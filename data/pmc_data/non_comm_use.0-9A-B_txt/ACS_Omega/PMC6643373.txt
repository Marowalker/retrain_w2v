The scaffold nature of Xeroderma
pigmentosum complementation
group A (XPA) protein makes it an important member of nucleotide excision
repair (NER) that removes bulky DNA lesions with the help of various
protein–protein interactions (PPI) and DNA–protein interactions.
However, many structural insights of XPA’s interaction and
the binding patterns with other NER proteins are yet to be understood.
Here, we have studied one such crucial PPI of XPA with another NER
protein, Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group
A (XPE), by using the previously identified binding site of XPA (residues
185–226) in the Assisted Model Building With Energy Refinement
force-field-mediated dynamic system. We studied the relationship between
XPA185–226–XPE complex using three different
docked models. The major residues observed in all of the models that
were responsible for the PPI of this complex were Arg20, Arg47, Asp51,
and Leu57 from XPE and the residues Leu191, Gln192, Val193, Trp194,
Glu198, Glu202, Glu205, Arg207, Glu209, Gln216, and Phe219 from XPE185–226. During the simulation study, the orientation
of XPA was also noted to be changed by almost 180° in models
1 and 3, which remain unchanged in model 2, indicating that XPA interacts
with XPE with its N-terminal end facing downward and C-terminal end
facing upward. The same was concurrent with the binding of DNA-binding
domain region of XPA (aa98–239) with XPE. The N-terminal of
XPE was stretched for accommodating XPA. Using the per-residue energy
decomposition analysis for the interface residues of all models, the
binding affinity between these proteins were found to be dependent
on R20, R47, and L57 of XPE and the residues L191, V193, W194, E198,
E202, E205, R207, and F219 of XPA. The net binding free energy of
the XPA185–226–XPE protein complex was found
to be −48.3718 kcal mol–1 for model 1, −49.09
kcal mol–1 for model 2, and −56.51 kcal mol–1 for model 3.

1 Introduction
DNA
is always under constant threats and attacks from entities
of endogenous or exogenous nature, which makes DNA repair response
a crucial mechanism in all living beings. Nucleotide excision repair
(NER) is one such DNA repair pathway that addresses bulky DNA damages,
such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PP),
and helix-distorting platinum (Pt) cross-links, which are inflicted
upon DNA by various mutagens.1−3 This process is mediated in a
multistep fashion by the coordinated interaction of more than 20 different
proteins, which is mainly overseen and systematized by Xeroderma
pigmentosum complementation group A (XPA) protein, earning
itself a title of “scaffolding protein”. XPA functions
as a primary damage recognition protein in both global genome NER
(GG-NER) and transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER).3−7 As a result, any alteration in the XPA gene or in
the protein function leads to classical Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) disease that is characterized by extreme sun sensitivity, neurological
damages, and is often linked with skin cancers.4,6,8−18

The highly conserved XPA,19−21 consisting of 273 residues,22 with its disordered N- and C-terminals, has
been reported to bind and interact with many proteins of NER as well
as with the damaged DNA.23−25 The DNA-interacting region of
XPA was mapped initially to the globular DNA-binding domain (DBD),
which spans between 98 and 219 amino acid residues,26,27 but since the earlier DBD lacked a significant amount of positive
residues for the strong bonding with the negatively charged DNA, the
DBD of XPA has been now redefined between 98 and 239 amino acid residues.28−30 To date, only a small number of the XPA’s protein–protein
interactions (PPI) with other NER proteins have been explored. Some
of the well-documented PPIs of XPA are with (i) helicase, transcription
factor II H (TFIIH) complex,3,11,31 (ii) GG-NER damage verifier, Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) protein,32−34 (iii) excision-repair
cross-complementing group 1 endonuclease (Xeroderma pigmentosum group F) (ERCC1/XPF),35−37 and (iv) replication protein
A70 (RPA70), which binds to the undamaged DNA.7,27,38 For the remaining, unexplored set of PPIs
between XPA and other NER proteins, only few binding sites of XPA
by which it communicates with other NER proteins have been identified,
whereas in some cases, vice versa, the binding site of the participating
fellow NER proteins through which they interact with XPA is not known.

Among many such PPIs of XPA, one such interaction is with Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E, also known
as the damaged DNA-binding protein 2 (DDB2/XPE), which is a subunit
of the heterodimer DDB1/DDB2 protein complex, involved in damage verification
and in the recognition of DNA lesions in GG-NER.39−41 In the earlier
in vitro and in vivo studies by Wakasugi et al.,42 the exact binding site of XPA through which it communicates
with XPE was identified. They mapped out the exact binding range of
XPA responsible for the interaction by conducting a series of N-terminal
residue truncations of XPA in various residue lengths, before identifying
its true binding location (aa185–226), which upon truncation
anywhere in between the regions of the protein decreased the binding
activity of these two proteins. They also reported a missense mutation
in XPA, R207G, which lowered the chances of XPA’s recruitment
to the NER bubble. This particular mutation further inhibited the
binding between XPA and XPE, leading to the incompetency on the part
of NER to remove the CPD lesion from the DNA strand in simian vacuolating
virus 40 (SV40) transformed human cells and thereby causing a complete
NER failure. Since there is no structure for XPA–XPE complex,
and the exact interaction site of XPA on XPE is not known either,
it thus becomes important that the key residues mediating the binding
of these two proteins be elucidated.

Therefore, in this study,
we have attempted to determine the probable
binding site of XPE to which XPA185–226 binds and
analyze their PPI using the molecular dynamics (MD) approach, which
is complementary to the experimental methods. Here, we prepared three
models for the protein complex of XPA185–226–XPE
using the ClusPro web server,43−45 followed by MD simulation of
the systems using the Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement
(AMBER) 14 software package46 to study
their conformational dynamics and stability. Furthermore, using the
molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area continuum
solvation (MM-PBSA) package,47−51 we also identified the probable residues responsible for their stable
protein formation using the per-residue energy decomposition (PRED)
analysis.

2 Results
2.1 Structural Modeling and
the Validation of
XPA185–226 Peptide, and the Selection of an Ideal
Docked Model for XPA185–226–XPE Complex
The protein structure of XPA185–226 was obtained
upon the submission of the protein’s FASTA sequence to the
Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement (I-TASSER) server. We obtained
a total of five models as shown in (Supporting Information Figure S1) based on the threading program, out
of which the best-ranked structure had a confidence score or C-score
of 1.91, a template modeling (TM) score of 0.70 ± 0.12, and a
root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2.5 ± 1.9 Å. This structure
was selected as our good fit model structure. A RAMPAGE analysis of
this top-ranked modeled structure from I-TASSER showed that 100.0%
of the residues were in the favored region and 0% were in the allowed
region and disallowed region (Supporting Information Figure S2A). The protein structure assessment (ProSA) web
server scores the fitness of the modeled structures in the form of
a Z-score after analyzing all of the atomic coordinates of the candidate
model. The ProSA server houses the Z-scores of all of the structures
that have been experimentally determined using NMR and X-ray crystallograpy
and have been deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB). If the Z-score
of any modeled structure falls within these Z-scores of deposited
PDB structures, then that modeled structure is said to have near-native
structure conformation. The Z-score for our structure, XPA185–226, as seen in Supporting Information Figure S2B, was −4.59, which indicated that our modeled structure is
near to the native structure conformation. The final stereochemical
quality of our model was analyzed using the MolProbity server, wherein
our model was given the overall score of 0.89 (100th percentile).
The detailed description scores for other attributes provided by the
MolProbity server are shown in Table 1. The analyses done by these three protein validation
tools confirmed that our modeled structure is indeed a good fit model.

It is an evidentiary fact that XPA’s and XPE’s PPIs,
in relation to one another, determine the NER’s outcome, which
is the removal of the DNA lesions from the genome.42 The in vivo/in vitro binding mechanism of XPA to XPE exclusively
studied by Wakasugi and his team was able to decipher the binding
site of XPA through its interaction with XPE, yet their interactions
at the molecular level are not known. So, to understand the molecular-level
PPI interactions between these two proteins, we docked the modeled
structure of XPA185–226 with XPE using a ClusPro
server. The 10 model structures that we obtained from ClusPro have
been shown in Supporting Information Figure S3 along with the ranking based on the cluster numbers, center score,
and their lowest energy weighted scores. In this study, we have selected
the centers (model structures) from the clusters of size greater than
or equal to 100 and having the lowest energy scores. On the basis
of these selection criteria, we could select only three top-ranked
structures for our study, which we named as models 1, 2, and 3. Model
1 represented the cluster of 181 members, with a cluster center score
of −849.6 kcal mol–1 and the lowest energy
score of −1104.3 kcal mol–1. Model 2 was
clustered from 123 cluster members, with the cluster center and lowest
energy scores of −952.3 and −1067.5 kcal mol–1, respectively. Similarly, model 3 represents the cluster of 111
members, with the cluster center and lowest energy scores of −859.3
and −1041.45 kcal mol–1, respectively. Figure 1 shows the docking
procedure as well as the surface and the cartoon structure for our
complexes. We observed that in all three cases, XPA185–226 was bound to XPE at the cleft within the residues at the N- terminal
and the C-terminal. The surface view of the docked complex shows the
closely bound nature of the complex for all models. As seen from Figure 1, the N-terminal
end of XPA185–226 in models 1 and 3 was facing upward,
whereas the C-terminal end was positioned downward, but in the case
of model 2, it was just the opposite. Hence, to investigate the proper
orientation of XPA’s binding characteristics, we had performed
MD simulation on all three models.

2.2 Interpretations
of the MD Trajectories for
the XPA185–226–XPE Complex
The molecular
dynamics simulation was administered to probe the structural and conformational
changes affecting the PPI between XPA185–226 and
XPE in an explicit environment. The MD trajectories of 40 ns simulation
for all of the models were extracted with PTRAJ (short for Process
TRAJectory) and CPPTRAJ (a rewrite of PTRAJ in C++) modules as a function
of time. The stability of our systems was assessed by measuring the
root RMSD of all Cα atoms from their initial coordinates. The
RMSD plot for all models of the XPA185–226–XPE
complex is given in Figure 2. The Cα atoms of model 1 initially fluctuated from
3 to 15 Å for a period of 15 ns, after which it started to settle. Models 2 and 3, on the other hand, started settling after 20 ns.
Model 3 settled faster than the other two models.

Figure 2 RMSD plot of Cα
carbon atoms of XPA185–226–XPE complex as
a function of time.

Since the solvent accessible
surface area (SASA) of any protein–protein
complex (PPC) is often associated with the number of hydrophobic contacts
between a solvent and a protein, and since the proteins participating
in a PPI are characterized by a larger accessible surface area,52 we also examined the SASA feature for our complex.
We found the SASA value for all of the models of XPA185–226–XPE complexes to be within 24 000–25 000
Å2 (see Figure 3), which suggests a stable interaction.

Figure 3 SASA plot for XPA185–226–XPE complex as
a function of time.

To get a better insight
into the RMSD changes, we next extracted
the conformational snapshots of our systems at an interval of 10 ns
each with respect to its equilibrated structure. Figure 4 shows the trajectory snapshots
for all three models of the XPA185–226–XPE
complex showing its conformational and structural changes at 0, 10,
20, 30, and 40 ns. Here, we observed XPA185–226 peptide
of all models to have exhibited secondary structural changes mainly
at the helices. One striking feature of XPA as seen from Figure 4 was the change in
its orientation, where the N-terminal region, which was initially
positioned upward in the case of models 1 and 3, had changed its position
by almost 180° and was now at the bottom position, meaning that
the C-terminal regions were now at the top. But in the case of model
2, XPA185–226 peptide retained its original position,
showing changes only in its secondary structural elements. These changes
can be observed in Figure 4, where the end terminal residues of XPA185–226 have been labeled to highlight the shift in XPA185–226’s orientation throughout the simulation. XPE, on the other
hand, exhibited the conformational changes restricted only to its
C-terminal end, which was stretched slightly from its original position.
This may be to place XPA to conduct PPI necessary to regulate NER.
The structural changes on the stretched end of XPE fluctuated in between
coils and helix, where helix was the most dominant secondary structural
element. The remaining structure of XPE showed no significant changes,
maintaining its original β-sheet and the coil form.

snapshots of XPA185–226–XPE
complex at different time intervals.

To gain more insights into the binding between XPA and XPE,
we
also docked the redefined DBD region of XPA (aa98–239) with
XPE to see whether they showed any similarity to these models of XPA–XPE
complex or not. We conducted MD simulation for the same, during which
we could observe that XPA98–239 was bound to XPE
in the same fashion as model 1 of the XPA185–226–XPE complex from the above scenario. The C-terminal residues
of XPA98–239 were seen to be at the top position,
whereas the N-terminal residues were at the bottom (Figure S4A,B). This orientation of XPA98–239 was retained throughout the simulation process, which further means
that the conformational changes undergone by XPA185–226 in the case of models 1 and 3 with regard to their orientation are
indeed concurrent with findings from the binding position of model
2’s XPA185–226 and DBD region of XPA to XPE
(N-terminal end toward bottom and C-terminal end at the top).

Next, we set to analyze the intermolecular hydrogen between XPA
and XPE since it is a known fact that the hydrogen bonds provide molecular
stability to the PPIs. The hydrogen bond analyses of the XPA185–226–XPE systems for the 40 ns simulation period are provided
in Figure 5. Models
1 and 2 exhibited a total of 20 intermolecular hydrogen bonds, with
an average of 15–17 hydrogen bonds, whereas model 3 had total
15 hydrogen bonds with an average of 13–14 hydrogen bonds that
were all within the ideal bond length and bond angles as demonstrated
earlier.53 The hydrogen bond occupancies
of this complex are accordingly given in Supporting Information Table S1A–C.

bond analyses of XPA185–226–XPE complex as
a function of time.

2.3 Protein–Protein
Interface Characterization
PPCs/PPIs of any living system
is usually characterized by the
presence of an interface area having a high number of hydrophobic
interactions and a large solvent accessible surface area.54−56 The interface residues of any PPC are further characterized by their
contact distance, which should be less than 6 Å from its interacting
partner proteins.57 So, to study the PPI
between XPA185–226 and XPE, we employed the Dimplot
program on the PDBsum server to help us identify and characterize
the interface residues present in the lowest energy conformer of our
protein complex.

The cartoon representation of our lowest energy
conformer for all of the models can be seen in Figure 6A,C,E. The interface statistics for our protein
complex is shown in Table 2, while all of the residue interactions for our PPI present
within this range (less than 6 Å) can be seen in Figure 6B,D,F, and the detailed contributions
of each residue required in forming our stable PPC are accordingly
provided in Supporting Information Table S2. We obtained 22 residues of XPE with an interface area of 1171 Å2 to be interacting with 19 residues of XPA185–226 having an interface surface area of 1124 Å2. Likewise,
models 2 and 3 had interface residues of 18 and 20 each for XPE with
interface areas of 870 and 1116 Å2, respectively.
XPA185–226 of models 2 and 3 were observed to have
interface residues of 18 and 22 with interface areas of 867 and 1074
Å2, respectively. The number of hydrogen bonds, salt
bridges, and hydrophobic contacts as seen in Table 2 were more or less the same for all models.

The PPIs of any PPCs can be classified into transient or permanent
interactions based on their interface area, the charges carried by
the interacting residues,56,58,59 and the number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridge formations.60 Since the interface size of an individual protein
to form the PPC was less than 1500 Å2 for all of the
models and has the presence of polar charged residues, the interaction
between XPA and XPE can be termed as the strong transient PPI (TPPI).

From Figure 6, we
can see that the most common residues of XPE to be involved in this
strong TPPI among all three models were mainly Arg20, Arg47, Asp51,
and Leu57. The common residues of XPA185–226 responsible
for the interaction among three models were Leu191, Gln192, Val193,
Trp194, Glu198, Glu202, Glu205, Arg207, Glu209, Gln216, and Phe219.
The residue of XPA, R207, which upon mutation to glycine (R207G) had
resulted in the inhibition of the XPA–XPE binding in an earlier
study,42 was seen to be involved in the
PPI with XPE in all three cases. R207 of model 1’s XPA formed
a hydrophobic contact with Cys364 of XPE, whereas R207 of models 2
and 3 was seen to have interacted with Asp49 of XPE by forming a salt
bridge, hydrophobic contact, and hydrogen bond. This means that R207
is very crucial for the binding of XPA and XPE. This particular residue
has also been stated to be important for the XPA–DNA interaction,61 and if mutated to other residues, it could lead
to severe neurological impairment and cancer.62,63 Q208, which reportedly causes classical XP-A phenotype upon mutation,64 was seen to have interacted with four residues
of XPE in the case of model 1 and five residues of XPE in the case
of model 3, but showed no signs of PPI in model 3. Q208 also has recently
been found to be involved in the DNA binding upon the NMR chemical
shift perturbation (CSP) assay on the DBD of XPA by Sugitani and the
group.30 The same study had also found
the weak DNA-binding activity of XPA upon the mutation of residue
L191V, which in this study was common to all models for conducting
the intermolecular interaction with XPE, further affirming its importance
to the functioning of XPE in terms of PPI in the working of NER.

Additionally, we had also done PPI profile study between DBD of
XPA (aa98–239) and XPE to see whether they showed any interactions
or not. We extracted the lowest energy conformer of this complex from
the highly populated clusters using RMSD clustering algorithm and
then submitted this structure to the PDBsum server for PPI analysis.
From the results obtained, we observed that the residues ranging between
aa98–184 were not involved in the PPI between XPA and XPE and
only the residues between aa185–226 were seen to participate
in the PPI between the two proteins. The detailed results of these
analyses can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S4C and Table S3). This further proves that XPA185–226 is the main driving force behind the binding
of XPA and XPE and their interaction, which is again in agreement
with Wakasugi’s findings.

2.4 Decomposing
the Free-Energy Contributions
to the Binding Free Energy (BFE) of XPA185–226 and
XPE on a Per-Residue Basis
The estimation of a binding free
energy (BFE) and its per-residue energy decomposition (PRED) between
two or more systems reflects the binding mechanisms of that particular
set of systems, whether it is a protein–protein or a protein–ligand
or a DNA–protein system.65,66 BFE and PRED studies
have been extensively used in deciphering the crucial amino acid residues
that contribute greatly to the PPI, drug–protein interactions.67,68

To gain insights into the contribution of the individual amino
acid residues to the overall PPI of XPA–XPE complex, PRED values
were calculated using MM-PBSA module of the AMBER 14 software package.
MM-PBSA uses a continuum solvent approach to determine the binding
free energies of a system. The PRED results for all of the interface
residues present in our complex are given in Figure 7A,B, and Supporting Information Table S4. R20, R47, and L57 were the common residues
to have exhibited the highest PRED values for all three models. The
highest energy contributions for XPA185–226 come
from the residues L191, V193, W194, E198, E202, E205, R207, and F219
in all the three models. R207 from XPA and R20 from XPE had the highest
energy decomposition rates for XPA185–226–XPE
complex among all of the models, as seen from Figure 6. The energy contribution of R207 is fairly
reflective of its effect on XPA–XPE binding and can also be
accounted for its role in the DNA binding where R207Q mutant was reported
to have lowered the DNA-binding efficacy of XPA.30 The decomposition energy yielded by F219 may also be related
to its association with XPE as well as with the DNA, since the protein
truncation of XPA at F219 position decreased the DNA-binding activity
of XPA.29

Figure 7 Per-residue energy decomposition (PRED)
plots for the interface
residues of (A) XPA185–226 and (B) XPE.

The PRED values of each residue in any PPI/PPC
have been known
to contribute to the overall BFE of that particular protein complex.
Hence, to address the stability of our models, we had also calculated
the BFE of XPA185–226–XPE complex for all
three models. The individual contribution of XPA185–226 and XPE to the complex formation is given in Table 3. The tabulated ΔΔGbinding using the PB method for models 1, 2, and 3 were
found to be −48.3718, −49.09, and −56.51 kcal
mol–1, respectively. This BFE can be very well accorded
with their electrostatic and polar solvation energies.

3 Discussion
PPIs are vital for all of the biological functions, whether it
is signaling cascades, molecular switching, hormone receptor reactions,56,58,59 or, in this case, a successful
removal of the DNA lesion, triggered by ultraviolet radiations and
anticancer agents. NER mechanism in a higher organism is rigorous
and effective due to the numerous transient and permanent PPIs between
various proteins, systematized largely by the XPA protein.4,6 XPA, in particular, is recruited to the damage site upon its C-terminal
interaction with p8 and p52 subunits of the TFIIH complex.3,11,31 This happens simultaneously with
the recruitment of RPA70 that protects the undamaged strand and stabilizes
the NER bubble, wherein it also interacts with the DBD portion of
XPA.7,27,38 The N-terminal
interaction of XPA (aa96–114) with the ERCC1 (aa92–119)
is responsible for the recruitment of ERCC1/XPF complex, a structure-specific
endonuclease to the damage site, which incises the lesion at 5′
end.35−37 Apart from these interactions, the accounts of many
new interactions of XPA with other proteins have surfaced over the
years. Reports of XPA’s new binding partners, proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)69 that is usually
seen only during the ligation stage of NER, and two novel XPA-binding
proteins (XAB), named XAB1,70 and XAB2,71 whose functions are not much known, suggest
that XPA may play a much larger role in NER than just a mere damage
verifier, and a scaffold protein.

The biochemical data provided
by Wakasugi’s team42 on the XPA–DDB2/XPE
interaction answered
some of the questions surrounding XPA’s scaffold nature. They
were able to successfully demonstrate that XPA interacted with DDB1/DDB2
complex only through its DDB2 or XPE subunit under both in vivo and
in vitro conditions, and not vice versa. They further went on to identify
the exact binding region on XPA (aa185–226), which helped in
establishing the PPI with XPE to conduct the NER process smoothly.
Our in silico investigation on the probable PPI of human XPA185–226 with XPE using the information provided by Wakasugi et al. research
findings showed that this interaction between XPA and XPE is stable.
The results that we obtained from PDBsum server and SASA analysis
suggested that this complex formation is of a strong transient PPI
type, which is fairly justifiable considering that both proteins,
especially XPA, are involved in forming various PPCs and PPIs with
the repair proteins during the NER process, which is initiated within
a fraction of seconds upon the damage detection and has to be quickly
tended to. The protein–protein docking study and the analyses
of the PPI profiles generated by PDBsum server for XPA–XPE
complex revealed that among XPA185–226 and DBD of
XPA (XPA98–239), the former length of the protein
is responsible for the binding and interaction with XPE, whereas the
XPA’s residues before and after 185–226 in the case
of XPA98–239–XPE complex were very much farther
from XPE to create the intermolecular PPI. The PRED results also showed
that XPA’s region between 185–226 contains residues
with high signatures of binding free energies, especially R207, which
contributed greatly to their PPI and PPC formation. The observations
made by Wakasugi and his team were also of a similar kind. They observed
that the truncations up to 184 amino acids from the N-terminal of
XPA showed no effect on the XPA–XPE binding, but even the slightest
truncation of further 42 amino acids (XPA185–226) greatly diminished the interaction. Similar binding properties
were obtained with purified DDB heterodimer, consistent with the notion
that XPA binds to DDB heterodimer by interacting with DDB2. These
results indicate that the amino-acid domain between 185 and 226 is
required for the XPA–XPE/DDB2 interaction.

The significance
of XPA185–226 is that the region
which codes for this particular protein segment ranges from the terminal
part of exon 4 through the whole part of exon 5 up to the beginning
section of exon 6 in the XPA gene. This exons 4, 5, and 6 are responsible
for coding the XPA’s residues aa130–273, which is also
the partial coding region for the DBD (aa130–239) of XPA. Therefore,
any deletion within this section (exon 4–6) or the protein
truncation at any position can not only inhibit the PPC formation
between XPA and XPE but also lead to the collapsing of NER.9,30 This binding region of XPA on XPE also coincides with the interaction
sites for TFIIH3,11,31 and with two NER-regulating proteins, ataxia telangiectasia and
Rad3-related protein (ATR), which localizes XPA to the damage site
by phosphorylating Ser196 in XPA,72 and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), which aids XPA in forming
the preincision complex (PIC) in NER.73 Our PRED analyses of the XPA’s residues also shed light on
the fact that the residues L191, R207, and F219 of XPA, which showed
higher PRED values for PPI with XPE, have also been mentioned in the
literature for playing a role in DNA interaction, PPI with other proteins,
and in causing XP-A phenotypes upon mutations. The higher-energy decomposition
values of these residues indicate their importance for XPA’s
functioning in NER.

Our present study has been able to shine
light on one of the binding
partners of XPA in terms of its scaffolding aspects, if not all. We
hope that with increasing progress in the study of XPA, the day may
come when all of the unsolved questions on XPA’s role with
different NER members (proteins and DNA) and its effect on NER outcomes
and even the newly reported binding partners of XPA will finally be
solved. The combination of structural, mechanistic, and dynamics data
will prove to be the key elements in meeting this goal.

4 Conclusions
In summary, our study has helped us determine
the probable binding
site of XPA185–226 on XPE and further characterize
the interface residues that are responsible for their PPI. The structural
and conformational dynamics study for all three models of the XPA185–226–XPE complex using all-atom MD simulations
suggests that this interaction is stable and also of a strong transient
type. The PRED analysis using MM-PBSA algorithm showed that the binding
affinity between two proteins is indeed high, and their intermolecular
PPI can be credited to the residues R20, R47, and L57 of XPE and the
residues L191, V193, W194, E198, E202, E205, R207, and F219 of XPA.

5 Materials and Methodology
5.1 Molecular Docking and the
Preparation of Initial
Structures
The three-dimensional structure of XPA185–226 was modeled by querying the desired protein sequence in Universal
Protein Resource (UniProt) database74 (ID:
P23025), after which it was submitted to the I-TASSER server75 that works on the protein threading and homology
strategy for the structure prediction. Out of the five obtained structures
from I-TASSER, we chose the best model based on the C-score, TM score,76 and RMSD score. We then validated the fitness
of the modeled structure using RAMPAGE server,77 ProSA server,78 and Molprobity
sever.79 For the structure of XPE, we retrieved
the X-ray crystallized structure of the XPE/DDB1 heterodimer, which
was in complex with DNA (PDB ID: 4E5Z)80 from the
Protein Data Bank,81 and removed the DDB1
protein and DNA from the heterodimer complex using the University
of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Chimera v.1.12,82 retaining only XPE (DDB2) for further steps.

Next,
we docked the best-represented structure of XPA185–226 with XPE using the ClusPro web server. This server, in particular,
predicts an ideal docked conformation using three main strategies:
(i) testing numerous conformations by fast Fourier transform-based
rigid docking using PIPER algorithm, wherein the ligand is rotated
70 000 times, and each rotation places the ligand in x, y, z axis relative
to the receptor on a grid, after which the best score of each rotation
is chosen for further testing; (ii) of the 70 000 rotations,
1000 ligands/conformers are chosen based on their lowest energy scores,
and (iii) 1000 conformers are clustered with 9 Å Cα RMSD
radius to represent the most favorable conformer of the complex from
their respective highly populated clusters, which means that the conformer
having maximum neighbor within 9 Å is chosen as the cluster center,
while its neighbors, which become part of that particular cluster,
are later removed to retain only one conformer (cluster center) to
represent that cluster. This is repeated for all of the clusters.
Finally, the 10 such cluster center conformers obtained from the populated
clusters are energy-minimized for 300 steps with fixed backbone using
CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics) force field.
The 10 model complexes (cluster centers) generated for the XPA185–226–XPE complex were ranked based on the
number of highly populated clusters, cluster center, and the lowest
energy weighted scores, out of which we chose top three models for
our study.

Using Amberff99 force field,83 we prepared
the initial coordinate and the topology file for the chosen docked
model of XPA185–226–XPE in the Leap module
of the AMBER 14 software package.46 The
whole system was hydrated with water molecules (model 1 = 16 879,
model 2 = 18 699, model 3 = 17 382) in a cuboid box
with a buffer distance of 10 Å using the TIP3P (transferable
intermolecular potential with 3 points) water model,84 and was added with charge-balancing counterions (17 Cl– ions each for all models) to neutralize the system.

5.2 MD Simulation of XPA185–226–XPE
Complex
MD study of our three systems/models
was done in AMBER 14 suite using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm,85 where the Leap prepared system was subjected
to a two-step energy minimization first with a nonbonded interaction
cutoff of 8 Å. The initial minimization was done using the steepest
descent algorithm by imposing restraints over the solute, while the
second conjugate gradient minimization method was done without any
such restraints. The heating dynamics of the systems were done by
gradually increasing the temperature from 0 to 300 K under constant
volume (NVT) conditions, followed by the equilibration at NPT conditions.
Full long-range MD production runs (40 ns) were done for the equilibrated
structure of all of the models using the PME algorithm.85 The Berendsen weak coupling algorithm86 (0.5 ps of heat bath and 0.2 ps of pressure
relaxation) was employed to control the temperature throughout the
simulation process. The SHAKE algorithm87 was used to restrain all of the bonds at the time step of 2 fs.

5.3 MD Analyses
The corresponding MD
trajectories (40 ns each) obtained by simulating the three models
of the XPA185–226–XPE complexes were analyzed
using PTRAJ and CPPTRAJ algorithms.88 Further,
we also determined the intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed between
XPA185–226 and XPE in all of the systems. The result
were drawn based on the bond occupancy, bond length (cutoff = 3 Å),
and bond angle (cutoff = 135°) formed (HA–H–HD)
between the hydrogen donor (HD) and the hydrogen acceptor (HA) atoms
of both proteins. The molecular graphics, visualization, and analyses
of all MD snapshots were performed using UCSF Chimera package v.1.12.

5.4 Determination of the Interface Residues
The lowest energy conformers of the XPA185–226–XPE
complex for all three models were extracted from the
highly populated cluster using RMSD clustering algorithm. The generated
structures were then uploaded to the PDBsum server89 for the determination of the intermolecular interactions
of all of the models.

5.5 PRED and BFE Analyses of
XPA185–226–XPE Complex
The relative
binding free energy (BFE)
and the per-residue energy decomposition (PRED) of the interface residues
of the protein complex in this present study were obtained using MMPBSA.py
script of the AMBER 14 suite based on the MM-PBSA algorithm.47−51,65,66 The PRED analysis breaks down the energy contributed by each residue
of a protein by studying its molecular interactions over all residues
in the system/complex. The MM-PBSA analysis was conducted for all
three models of XPA185–226–XPE using the
following components: (i) XPA185–226 (ligand), (ii)
XPE (receptor), and (iii) XPA185–226–XPE
(complex), by taking full 40 ns MD trajectories into account.

The free energy of XPAligand + XPEreceptor =
XPA–XPEcomplex was calculated using the following
equations derived from the second law of thermodynamics, where they
were studied in both gas (vacuum) and aqueous environments. 1  Here, Gbinding is the total binding free
energy and Gcomplex, Greceptor, and Gligand are
the relative free energies of the XPA185–226–XPE,
XPE, and XPA185–226, respectively.
The free energy (G) for each component can be obtained
by adding the sum of changes in the gas-phase molecular mechanics
energies (ΔEMM), polar and nonpolar
solvation energy (ΔGsolvation),
and conformational entropy (−TΔS) of the system (see eq 2). 2   3   4   5  where EMM from eq 3 is the difference in the
internal energy (Einternal), van der Waals
forces (EvdW), and electrostatic energy
(Eele). The solvation free energy, Gsolvation, as seen from eq 4 was calculated as the sum of the polar contribution
(GPB) and nonpolar contribution (Gsurf). Thus, the free energy of any system can
also be explained as the sum of molecular mechanics, solvation free
energy, and conformational entropies (see eq 5).

Using PB solver of the AMBER 14 pbsa
module,90 the polar solvation energies
were determined for the complex.
The probe radius and the grid space for our estimation were set to
1.4 and 0.5 Å, respectively. We maintained the dielectric constant
of the interior (solvent) and external (solute) as 80 and 1, respectively.
Using the solvent accessible surface area (SASA), the nonpolar contribution
(Gsurf) to the solvation free energy was
calculated (see eq 6).
The nonpolar solvation energy for PB method was obtained by taking
γ = 0.00542 kcal mol–1 Å–2 and β = 0.92 kcal mol–1. 6
