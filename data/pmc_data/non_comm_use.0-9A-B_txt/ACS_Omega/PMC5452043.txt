As
a sequel to results obtained on the low-temperature behavior
of liquids, a similar study is presented for solids. A molecule in
a solid interacts with the other molecules of the crystal so that
it is subjected to a specific multimolecular potential, kT0. At temperature T < T0, the molecules are localized, and at T > T0, they can participate in processes
like self-diffusion and evaporation. As a consequence, the van’t
Hoff equation is disobeyed at a low temperature and properties like
vapor pressure, diffusion rate, or reactivity are zero below the specific
temperature, T0, which here can be interpreted
as a temperature of thermal stability of the solid. To account for
this view, the van’t Hoff equation, represented by the green
curve in the figure, is extended with a suitable pre-exponential factor,
leading to the red curve. Three examples, taken from the literature,
are analyzed to demonstrate its applicability. These examples are:
the thermal dissociation of calcium carbonate, the sublimation equilibrium
pressure of naphthalene, and that of ice. For some other solids, equilibria
and dynamic properties, X(T), are
examined by means of extrapolations in the X(T) versus T domain, showing the presence
of an arrest temperature, which coincides, within experimental accuracy,
with the T0 value obtained from the corresponding
vapor pressure. As with liquids, kT0 is
found to be proportional to the molecular pair potential.

1 Introduction
“Although
the great practical value of thermodynamics is
undeniable, ..., there are certain limitations that must be borne
in mind. The methods of thermodynamics are independent of atomic and
molecular structure, and also of reaction mechanism.” [Glasstone,
Thermodynamics for Chemists, p. 1]1

For a one-component object with two phases at equilibrium,
the
Phase Rule dictates that it can have only one degree of freedom.2 This means that the choice of the value of one
intensive property fixes the values of all other intensive properties.
In the majority of cases, the temperature is the chosen property.
Consequently, there must be an unequivocal relationship between any
intensive property and temperature. The nature of such a relationship,
that is, its mathematical form, however, remains undetermined and
has to be derived from some other theory.

General agreement
exists that thermodynamics is the theory that
produces the expression for the temperature dependence of a property, X, and that it has an exponential form 1  which is
the integrated form of the van’t
Hoff equation. Its usual graphical representation is a plot of ln X(T) against 1/T, known
as the van’t Hoff plot, which should be linear, so that its
slope produces the enthalpy, ΔH, of an equilibrium.2 This simple theory has met expectations in many
fields in physics and physical chemistry and continues to be applied
successfully, sometimes taking a weak temperature dependency of ΔH into account. (For its history, see, for instance, ref (3).) It has become common
usage to describe the temperature dependence of the rate constants
of the processes involved in the equilibrium with the Arrhenius equation,
which takes the same form as eq 1, but with ΔH replaced by the heat
of activation, ΔH#.2

Equation 1 implies
that X(T) is zero at T = 0 K. However, in a series of three papers, we have collected substantial
evidence that the (intensive) properties of liquids converge to zero
at a finite temperature, T0, which we
named “arrest temperature”.4−6 In ref (4), primarily undertaken to
investigate the electrical conduction by simple ions in water, we
discovered that on extrapolation these conductivities all become zero
at a finite temperature, T0 = 243 K. Thereupon,
we established that many more properties of water (e.g., self-diffusion,
fluidity, vapor pressure) and of its solutes (e.g., diffusivity, solubility,
reactivity) follow the same behavior.5 The
phenomenon was also shown to exist for a variety of other liquids,
wherein, similarly, many properties converge to zero at the same finite
temperature, T0, a specific property of
the liquid, always found to occur in its supercooled region.6

Considering this effect initially as a
“property”
of the (supercooled) liquid state, we gradually developed an understanding
of it as an effective immobilization of the liquid owing to the increasing
dominance of the molecular interactions in the system at lower temperatures.6 Remarkably, T0 was
found to be proportional to the energy parameter ε/k of the molecular pair potential of the solvent.6

It is the aim of this article to investigate whether
such a temperature
of arrest also occurs in the case of solids. This is important because
the complicating metastability of a supercooled liquid is absent here.
In contrast, for a solid, the arrest temperature, T0, should, in principle, be directly experimentally accessible,
and moreover, discussions on a so-called glassy or vitreous state
will not apply. The meaning of this T0 would be similar to the liquids’ case, that is, a temperature
below which the molecules in the solid are strictly immobilized.

As before,4−6 our strategy was to collect literature data of experimental
results on the temperature dependence of some property of a species
and to extrapolate it toward a lower temperature. Because experimental
results sometimes were reported after being corrected somehow, for
these graphical analyses raw, unprocessed, experimental data will
be used by preference. It should be remembered that such data were
not measured with the intent to study the low-temperature behavior
in particular but only to test the validity of eq 1. Generally, with modern techniques, extension
of the studied temperature interval down to T = T0, and also even below, may be possible for
solids and with better accuracy.

However, besides equilibrium
vapor pressure data, generally data
on properties of a different kind are scarce for solids, and in many
cases, one is limited to the vapor pressure, P, of
a solid. Usually, P obeys van’t Hoff’s
equation at a relatively high temperature, in conformity with eq 1. Deviation, leading to
the observation of a T0, requires some
mathematical remodeling, which we will discuss in the next section.
The applicability of these approaches will be investigated in detail
for the CO2 dissociation pressure of CaCO3 and
the vapor pressure of solid naphthalene and ice. Several further examples
will be presented to show the general occurrence of arrest temperatures, T0, of solids.

2 Theoretical
Approach
Of course, the two different temperature dependences,
that is,
the familiar exponential at a high temperature, in conformity with eq 1, and a polynomial relationship
that occurs at a low temperature, near T0, at which X(T) drops to zero,
cannot hold true simultaneously. Clearly, they are to be combined
in such a way that the two behaviors dominate in their respective
temperature ranges, that is, at a high temperature according to eq 1 and at a low temperature
polynomial, with a smooth transition in between. This can be accomplished,
for example, by extending eq 1 with a pre-exponential factor, F(T), according to 2  and tentatively specifying F(T) as 3  which satisfies both requirements
if T ≥ T0.

The pre-exponential factor, F(T), should represent the temperature-dependent fraction of the molecules
that have a kinetic energy exceeding kT0 and that consequently are able to participate in the process or
equilibrium under consideration. As has been shown earlier, T0 is a specific property of the condensed phase
and should be identical for the different properties, X. The latter need not be necessarily so for parameter a.

It might be considered to further specify this definition,
assuming
the existence of a kinetic energy distribution function, f(E, T), for the molecules. Then,
the pre-exponential factor, F(T),
can be written as 4  the integrals
in which are generally named
cumulative distribution functions. However, the kinetic energy distribution
function is only known for a Maxwell–Boltzmann gas, that is,
a gas without interaction. Yet, such an approach might, as an approximation,
be useful as a (partial) justification of our eq 2. The rather phenomenological eq 3, however, has as yet more practical
use.

Simply extrapolating available data as a function of temperature
proved to be essentially useful to obtain T0 in our studies of the liquids.4−6 However, it may occur that at
low temperatures, X(T) drops, seemingly
asymptotically, to very low values, almost coinciding with the temperature
axis in a considerable temperature interval. In such cases of a so-called
“hidden intercept”, it will be helpful to plot some
well-chosen power, y [0 < y <
1] of the quantity X(T) versus T. Applications of this procedure, which were explained
in detail in ref (5), will also be shown and discussed below.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Thermal Dissociation of Calcium Carbonate
In the thermal dissociation equilibrium reaction CaCO3 ↔ CaO + CO2, the pressure P of
the evolved CO2 is the only temperature-dependent property.
For the following analysis, it is essential to avail of data of high
precision in an extended temperature range, especially toward the
low-temperature end. Such data are available in a study in 1956 by
Hill and Winter,7 giving the equilibrium
CO2 pressure at temperatures between 449 and 904 °C.
These authors concluded from their experimental data that the simple
exponential eq 1 applies
to their whole temperature range, in contradiction with the earlier
literature [see references in ref (7)], in which additional terms were considered necessary
for a fit. In Table 1, we illustrate the stepwise procedure followed presently to analyze
the data in the whole temperature range.

3.1.1 Extrapolation
In columns 1 and
2, the data of ref (7) are reproduced, with temperature T in K and pressure P in Pa. Columns 3 and 4 list the values of P0.5 and P0.3 in the lower
temperature range, which are used to construct the plots in Figure 1. On extrapolation,
these plots intersect the horizontal axis at T0 = 620–640 K, which indicates the existence of a temperature
of arrest, as was explained in section 6 of our earlier paper.5Figure 1 also exhibits some points of the original data, P(T), and a curve of Pcalc versus T, derived from the involuted plots. Together,
these three curves demonstrate the importance of the involution procedure.

of the arrest temperature of CaCO3 by involution
of the CO2 equilibrium pressure7 using two exponents. The plots comprise a temperature range of 500–900
K.

3.1.2 van’t
Hoff Fit
In the next
step, assuming that at a sufficiently high temperature the CaCO3/CaO+CO2 system behaves in accordance with eq 1, P values
in the range 1177 > T > 1076 K are fitted to
an exponential
of 1/T. In Figure 2 it is shown that the “ideal” exponential
behavior is indeed obeyed, described by 5  

Figure 2 CO2 vapor pressure of CaCO3 in the high-temperature
region, with P data in the range of 1177–1076
K. The red curve is calculated with eq 5 and extended to T = 1010 K.

3.1.3 Evaluation
of F(T)
Next, eq 5 is used to calculate Pid for
the full temperature range, as listed in Table 1, column 5. Comparing with the experimental P by calculating P/Pid, it is seen in column 6 that eq 2 is fairly well obeyed down to T = ca. 992 K. At a lower temperature, P/Pid gradually decreases to about 0.5 at 750 K.
Thus, a gradual deviation from van’t Hoff behavior is observed
on going to a lower temperature.

It is clear that P/Pid should equal the pre-exponential
factor, F(T), introduced in eq 2 and tentatively described
by F(T) = [1 – exp(−a(T – T0))]. Its validity can be tested by fitting the data in column 6 to
this expression. We find that the best fit gives T0 = 640 K and a = 0.0067 K–1. Using these results and eq 3, theoretical values of F(T) are calculated, listed in column 7 of Table 1, and represented in Figure 3, together with the experimental results
of column 6. The agreement is satisfactory, although the data are
somewhat scattered.

Figure 3 Deviation from van’t Hoff behavior, expressed by P/Pid, as described in the text,
depends on the temperature according to the proposed pre-exponential
factor, F(T) = 1 – exp[−a(T – T0)].

It can be concluded that the thermal
dissociation of CaCO3 is arrested at a temperature T0 = 630
± 10 K and the corresponding deviation from ideal, thermodynamical,
behavior is fairly well described by eqs 2 and 3.

3.2 Vapor Pressure of Solid Naphthalene
The sublimation
equilibrium of naphthalene, which is a solid below
353.55 K, has been widely accepted as a model system for the calibration
of devices measuring vapor pressures. Consequently, vapor pressures
as a function of temperature have been accurately determined several
times with very good agreement. For our purpose, we selected two reports8,9 that include data at higher temperatures, that is, 253 < T < 353 K, and two reports10,11 particularly
focused at low temperatures, at about 240 < T <
260 K. Inevitably, the latter data are less precise. Nevertheless, Figure 4 shows that the results
for P0.5 versus T fit
very well together.

Figure 4 Square root of the vapor pressure of solid naphthalene,
obtained
from different authors,8−11 as indicated, extrapolated to the arrest temperature.

The analysis, following the same route as described
for CaCO3, leads to the following results:(i) The intersection
of the plot in Figure 4 gives an arrest
temperature, T0 = 222 K.

(ii) The plot of P versus
1/T in the region 353 > T >
303
K is found to obey eq 1 with 6  

(iii) The value of P/Pid is close to unity down to ca. 285 K and then
decreases to become about 0.8 at 244 K. Naturally, it is zero at the
arrest temperature, T0 = 222 K. Numerical
fit of these results to the expression in eq 3 for the pre-exponential factor produces the
red curve in Figure 5 and a = 0.044 K–1.

for solid naphthalene.

3.3 Vapor Pressure and Dielectric Relaxation of
Ice
An extensive literature exists on the vapor pressure
and the heat of sublimation of ice. From a well-documented review
by Murphy and Koop,12 it follows that eq 1 applies adequately in
the temperature region 175 < T < 273, whereas
also more elaborate parameterizations have been proposed, for example,
in the frequently cited theoretical work of Wexler.13 We selected both the recently presented data of Bielska
et al.14 and the earlier study by Marti
and Mauersberger15 and found these to obey 7  in the above-mentioned region. Later, however,
Mauersberger and Krankowsky16 were able
to extend the temperature range down to 164.5 K and thereby observed
a significant departure from eq 7. Their data were displayed in a logarithmic graph, from which
we obtained pressure values that are as accurate as possible. In Figure 6, it is shown that
the combined data of refs (14) and (16) connect nicely into one continuous plot, which easily extrapolates
to P = 0 at T0 = ca.
160 K.

Figure 6 Experimental ice vapor pressure14−16 arrests at 160 K. Both P and P0.5 are plotted.

Following the analysis described
in the foregoing sections, we
find that P/Pid is close
to unity from T = 273 K down to 169 K but decreases
thereafter according to P/Pid = [1 – exp(−a(T – T0))], with a = 0.45 K–1 and T0 =
158 K. With this high value for a, the plot of P/Pid against T sharply bends toward the arrest temperature, as shown in Figure 7. Notably, the additional
data of ref (16) are
essentially valuable for the analysis.

Figure 7 Pre-exponential factor
for ice derived from analysis of the vapor
pressure.

Ice is an important substance
and so besides vapor pressure several
more of its properties have been described in the literature, which
may support our value of T0, although
one would wish for more accurate data points at low temperatures.
A possible example is the dielectric relaxation of ice-Ih as a function
of temperature, which was the subject of the pioneering study in 1958
by Auty and Cole.17 In later work by other
researchers, severely different results were reported, which only
recently could be ascribed to the manner of preparation of the ice
specimen.18 From the latter study, it follows
that the data obtained by slow crystallization of the ice, as performed
in ref (17), are to
be preferred. A plot of the reciprocal of the dielectric relaxation
time, τ, in Figure 8 produces T0 = 170 K, close to
the value of 160 K found from the vapor pressures.

Figure 8 Reciprocal of the dielectric
relaxation time of ice-Ih extrapolates
to zero at 170 K.

The T0 of ice, 160 K, is far below
the T0 of water, 243 K. This explains
the puzzling intersection of the vapor pressure lines of ice and supercooled
water against T, discussed by Kraus and Greer19 and ourselves.5 Also,
it shows that the multimolecular potential, defined as kT0,6 of ice is 0.66 times its
value for water. This agrees with the more open structure of ice,
with its larger intermolecular distances, as follows from its low
density. Further analysis produced a = 0.051 K–1 for liquid water, about 10 times smaller than that
for ice.

3.4 Vapor Pressures of Pure
Substances
In the three cases of low-temperature behavior
reported above, significant
deviation from eq 1 could
be demonstrated. Also, it is clear that the parameters a and T0 in eq 3 characterize the temperature range in which
the deviation shows up. On the other hand, the extrapolations cover
also the higher temperatures where van’t Hoff behavior prevails
at least apparently. This encourages the idea that the extrapolation
approach, leading to the arrest temperature, is valid more generally,
also when the low-temperature data are not available.

This happens
to be the case with vapor pressures of pure substances available from
the extensive collections of P–T relations of both organic and inorganic compounds.20 Here, we select three examples with relatively small molecules,
CH4, CO2, and NH3, plotted in Figure 9. The T0 values are obtained from extrapolations by eye and next
drawing with polynomials of the appropriate degree. In the present
case, P1/2 is plotted, which provides
a clear picture with a sharp intersection of the temperature axis.

Figure 9 Square
root of the vapor pressures of solid CH4, CO2, and NH320 plotted
against temperature shows the three T0 ’s at 50, 110, and 130 K, respectively.

3.5 Hydrates and Ammoniacates
The salt
Mg(ClO4)2 easily associates with H2O to form distinct solid hydrates with 2, 4, or 6 water molecules.
Depending on the amount of water, at equilibrium, mixtures of only
two of these salt hydrates will always occur. The water vapor pressure
of a mixture then equals the pressure of the highest hydrate.

Besley and Bottomley21 studied the equilibrium
vapor pressures of the following mixtures:A. Mg(ClO4)2·6aq
+ Mg(ClO4)2·4aq

B. Mg(ClO4)2·4aq
+ Mg(ClO4)2·2aq

C. Mg(ClO4)2·2aq
+ Mg(ClO4)2



With
two components, Mg(ClO4)2 and H2O,
and three phases (two hydrates and the vapor), one degree
of freedom remains,2 that is, a single P–T relationship for each of the
three pairs. Figure 10 shows the appurtenant equilibrium water vapor pressures as a function
of temperature. The three curves appear to coincide in a common intersection
point with the temperature axis, at T0 = 240–250 K, which is remarkably close to the T0 of pure supercooled water.4,5As at that temperature,
243 K, salts are insoluble in water,4,5 the intersection
might indicate a separation of the hydrates into water and dehydrated
magnesium perchlorate. Probably also the vapor pressures of saturated
MgClO4 solutions against temperature will fit in Figure 10. Similar behavior
occurs with the three ammoniacates of AgCl.22

3.6 Properties
of Metals
From several
studies, we obtained the temperature dependence of the self-diffusion
of silver23 and of gold24 as well as the trace diffusion of silver in (pure) gold
and of gold in (pure) silver.25 The data,
represented in Figure 11, form a family of curves, all with arrest temperature T0 = 840 K. As can be expected, the two processes that
occur in gold have the same T0. Likewise,
the self-diffusion of silver and the diffusion of gold in silver will
become zero at an identical T0 value.
Remarkably, the T0 ’s of the gold
and silver systems are also very close. This may be considered to
be accidental, possibly owing to the almost equal atomic radii of
the two metals.

polycrystalline
zinc and self-diffusion coefficients27 of
single crystalline zinc all extrapolate to zero at T0 = 510 K, as shown in Figure 12.

and perpendicular to the symmetry axis, respectively.

3.7 Mobility of Vacancies in
Doped Crystals
The electrical conductance of solid alkali
halides proceeds mainly
by the motion of cation vacancies present in the “pure”
crystal, and is increased by doping the crystal with divalent cations.
In Figure 13 are shown
the conductivity data for single crystalline NaCl doped with CdCl2, measured by Etzel and Maurer28 and tabulated by Lidiard.29

Figure 13 Square root
of electrical conductivity of sodium chloride,28,29 doped with CdCl2 in varied concentrations, producing
the same T0. The mole fraction of CdCl2 is equal to 10–5c.

It is commonly assumed that in
a certain temperature region the
conductivity, σ, should obey a relationship of the type σ
= (A/T) exp[−B/T]. In ref (28), this is indeed observed for 520 < T < 680 K. However, the plots in Figure 13 fit nicely to a family of curves converging
to a common intersection point at T0 =
450 K, which obviously can be considered to be the arrest temperature
of solid sodium chloride.

3.8 Solubility of Hydrogen
in Metals
A property of hydrogen is its capacity to dissolve
in several metals
in the form of atomic H. In transition metals like nickel, cobalt,
rhodium, and so on, the solubility decreases with decreasing temperature.30 In Figure 14, this is shown for polycrystalline nickel and rhodium
as the solvents, with T0 values of 380
and 750 K, respectively. A similar plot for cobalt,31 the properties of which are close to those of nickel, has
an arrest temperature of 520 K. However, in single crystalline nickel,31 the solubility is much lower, and T0 = 570 K.

3.9 Vapor
Pressures of Solid Noble Gases
In our previous paper,6 it was shown that
for the noble gases in the (supercooled) liquid state, an arrest temperature
is obtained on plotting the equilibrium vapor pressure, the fluidity,
or the diffusivity versus temperature. Vapor (sublimation) pressures
of solidified noble gases are also available, and have been collected
by Pollack with the purpose of testing the applicability of the law
of corresponding states.32 With the exception
of neon, the corresponding states law was found to apply.32,33 In Figure 15, we
use the large data set of Leming and Pollack33 for solid argon, krypton, and xenon, and the data collected in ref (20) for solid neon and radon.
The resulting arrest temperatures are 13, 45, 58, 88, and 115 K respectively.

Figure 15 Vapor
pressures of solid noble gases20,33 are zero at
their respective T0’s.

These T0 values might
obey a corresponding
state relationship as well. We choose to test this by calculating
the reduced arrest temperature, T0,r = T0/Tc, where Tc is the critical temperature. The result is
0.29, 0.30, 0.285, 0.30, and 0.305, for Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and Rn, respectively.

4 Relation between T0 and
Molecular Pair Potential
In our earlier paper concerning
the behavior of liquids,6 we discussed
extensively the possibility of a
linear relationship between the arrest temperature and the parameter
ε/k, which is an essential quantity in, for
example, the Lennard-Jones or the Stockmayer formulation of the pair
potential between simple spherical or quasispherical molecules. Indeed,
for a considerably broad selection of such molecules, this linearity
could be established.

Table 2 gives a
selection of simple molecules for which we have evaluated the T0 values of the solid phase and for which ε/k values are available from the literature.34−36 The arrest temperatures are tabulated both for the liquid and the
solid phases. In Figure 16, these T0’s are plotted
versus ε/k showing that, indeed, a linear relationship
appears to hold also for the solid phase.

between the arrest temperatures of liquids
and solids and the energy parameter in the Lennard-Jones or Stockmayer
pair potential, using the data from Table 2.

In ref (6), we proposed
to define the multimolecular potential, kT0, as the Boltzmann energy, below which the mutual interactions of
the molecules keep them locally stuck. The stronger the interaction,
the higher the temperature at which, for instance, evaporation or
(self)diffusion starts. From the slopes of the lines in Figure 16, it follows that
the multimolecular potential of a solid is about 0.8 times that of
the corresponding supercooled liquid.

5 Conclusions
At the end of the 19th century, after the van’t Hoff equation
for the quantitative description of the temperature dependence of
chemical and physical equilibria was introduced, it became general
practice to report logarithms of experimental equilibrium and rate
constants, plotted versus 1/T. Also the more recent,
sometimes complex, theoretical calculations on reaction rates invariably
contained a term like exp[−B/T] as the dominating part,37,38 and prompted similar
logarithmic representations.

However, taking a logarithm is
apt to reduce the resolution of
data and obscure a possible deviation from the accepted model. After
having discovered the deviant low-temperature behavior in the case
of water4,5 and other liquids,6 we believe that the direct extrapolation of data versus T toward lower temperature is to be preferred, if necessary,
after involution5,6 of the experimental data. The
latter must be done with care, applying several values of the power y mentioned in Section 2.

In addition, in the present article, we propose
an extension of
the van’t Hoff equation, eq 2, with the tentative formulation of F(T) in eq 3. We note that the latter expression is mathematically the
simplest conceivable. From the three examples in Figures 3, 5, and 7, it can be deduced that the “steepness
parameter” a can attain strongly variant values,
thus determining the temperature range in which the decline toward
the arrest takes place. These three examples provide strong evidence
that the direct extrapolations really lead to a temperature, T0, where the pressure becomes zero. The examples
involving rates (diffusion in metals, conductance in doped crystals)
or solubilities (hydrogen in metals) corroborate this view.

To our knowledge, the possibility of a breakdown of the van’t
Hoff behavior owing to the increasing domination of molecular interactions
at low temperature has not been recognized earlier for cases involving
solids. In contrast, it is generally believed that vapor pressures,
although very low, remain finite down to 0 K.

The several examples
presented here may initiate more investigations
of the same type. To this end, the range and accuracy of data reported
in the literature could be improved with present-day techniques. The
obtained arrest temperatures, then, could be compared with the molecular
pair potential to further confirm the interesting proportionality
shown in Figure 16.
