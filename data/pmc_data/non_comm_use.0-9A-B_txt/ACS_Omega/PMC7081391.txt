The
crystal structure, electronic structure, and diffusion mechanism
of Na ions in the cathode material Na2Mn3(SO4)4 are investigated based on the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof
hybrid density functional method. The simultaneous motion model of
polaron–sodium vacancy complexes was used to reveal the diffusion
mechanism of Na ions in this material. Polaron formation at the Mn
third-nearest neighbor to the Na vacancy was found. Two crossing and
two parallel elementary diffusion processes of the polaron—Na
vacancy complex were explored. The most preferable elementary diffusion
process has an activation energy of 852 meV, which generates a zigzag-like
pathway of Na-ion diffusion along the [001] direction in the whole
material. Possessing a voltage of 4.4 V and an activation energy of
852 meV, Na2Mn3(SO4)4 is
expected to be a good cathode material for rechargeable sodium ions.

Introduction
During the past decade,
searching cathode materials for sodium-ion
batteries (SIBs) has become a new attractive direction.1 The key reasons to explain this trend are based
on sodium’s properties and its natural availability. Many recent
studies figured out that although Na ions possess larger radii and
heavier ion weight than Li ions (rNa =
0.98 Å, mNa = 23 g/mol, and rLi = 0.69 Å, mLi = 6.9 g/mol), Na ions can diffuse effortlessly inside electrodes,
and sodium-based materials own insignificantly different voltages
compared with analogous lithium compounds.2 Several groups of sodium-based materials have been classified by
their compositions and structures, such as oxide NaxMO2 (where M is V, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni),3−6 phosphate (olivine/maricite NaMPO4, NASICON Na3M2(PO4)3, and NaVOPO4),7−9 pyrophosphate Na2FeP2O7,10 sulfate Na2Mn(SO4)4,11 carbonate Na3MnPO4CO3,12 and organic materials.13 The entire voltage in the range of 2.0–4.5
V of the abovementioned materials is just 0.18–0.57 V lower
than that of lithium materials with similar structures.14 Moreover, the amount of sodium precursor is
almost infinite, whereas the lithium resource in the earth is limited,
leading to the fact that its raw material price is about 10–60
times lower than that of lithium. For example, the price of lithium
carbonate is about 4.11–4.19 €/kg, whereas it is 0.07–0.37
€/kg for sodium carbonate.2 As a
consequence, the prices of SIBs are estimated to be much lower than
those of lithium-ion batteries. SIBs are expected to become the next
generation of ion-rechargeable batteries.

Among the materials
applied for SIBs, sulfate-based polyanion compounds
have drawn much attention because of the high redox potential. Many
distinct structures containing sulfate groups have been reported,
such as eldfellite NaFe(SO4)2,15 alluaudite Na2Mn(SO4)3,11,16,17 and kröhnkite
Na2M(SO4)2·2H2O (where
M is a transition metal).18−20 Experimentally, the orthorhombic
structure of Na2Mn3(SO4)4 was synthesized first time in 2016 and evaluated as a promising
cathode material with voltage up to 4.4 V.21 The structure of this material contains the tunnels which encourage
Na ions to diffuse easily inside. Although the bond valence map (BVM)
method was employed to predict the most preferable diffusion direction,
the diffusion mechanism has yet to be explained clearly.21 Thus, an intensive investigation is necessary
to fully evaluate the electrochemical performance of this compound.

During the diffusion of Li/Na inside the inorganic cathode materials,
a small polaron is treated as an important factor which intensely
affects the charging and discharging processes. Up until 2006, Ceder
et al. employed the density functional theory (DFT) to provide the
evidence of the small polaron formed by self-trapped charges caused
by the lattice distortion in the defect structure of LiMnPO4 and came to conclusion of a strong polaron–Li ion interaction
because of a binding energy of approximately 500 meV.22 Based on the finding of the prior research, Ellis et al.23 and Mauger et al.24 individually explained their experimental results of slow charge
carrier migration in LiMnPO4 (Ea = 775 meV) and LiFePO4 (Ea = 665 meV), respectively, by taking into account the magnetic polaron
effect. Later in 2011, Ong et al. reported an activation energy of
303 meV (196 meV) and 170 meV (133 meV) for the free positive (negative)
polaron migration in LiFePO4 and LiMnPO4, respectively.25 Obviously, the polaron migration makes an undeniable
contribution to the overall diffusion mechanism of the charge carriers
inside cathode materials. Afterward, Dinh et al. proposed a complex
diffusion model in which the Li-/Na-ion diffusion is treated as an
elementary diffusion process (EDP) and in which Li/Na diffusion is
accompanied with a simultaneous migration of the small polaron.26,27 Three EDPs, including the single, crossing, and parallel processes,
are assumed in revealing that the diffusion pathways and the diffusion
processes in the whole material are treated as combinations of EDPs.
The hypothesis of the Li/Na ion—small polaron complex diffusion
after this was applied to several types of cathode materials to explore
the diffusion mechanism and acquire reasonable results.7−9,12,26−29 The comprehensive investigation to clarify the diffusion mechanism
of the Na ion–polaron complex in inorganic materials would
be indispensable to simulate accurately their electrochemical properties.
Herein, we employ this hypothesis to investigate the diffusion mechanism
of Na ions in Na2Mn3(SO4)4.

Results and Discussion
Crystal and Electronic Structures
The Na2Mn3(SO4)4 system
in the Cmc21 orthorhombic group21 has a unit cell containing 12 distorted MnO6 groups,
the corners of which share with the other MnO6 octahedron
and SO4 tetrahedron, as illustrated in Figure 1. In order to determine the
most stable magnetic arrangement of Mn ions, the total energy of the
different magnetic configurations—antiferromagnetic (AFM),
ferromagnetic (FM), and nonmagnetic (NM)—was calculated. As
the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid density functional
method (HSE06) and the general gradient approximation (GGA) method
with an addition of Hubbard-like term U (GGA + U method) give the same trend in determining the stable
alignment of Mn ions for the pristine structure Na2Mn3(SO4)4, in order to save the computation
cost, we employed the GGA + U method (U = 3.9 eV) to explore the most stable structure. For the AFM alignment,
we considered four configurations of Mn magnetic moments, namely AFM1,
AFM2, AFM3, and AFM4, as illustrated in Figure S1. Among the four AFM configurations, AFM3 has the lowest
total energy which is lower than that of AFM1, AFM2, and AFM4 by an
amount of 25.0, 25.1, and 21.5 meV, respectively. The total energy
of FM alignment is insignificantly higher than that of AFM3 by 40
meV and considerably lower than that of NM configuration by 58.15
eV, which implies that both the FM and AFM configurations can be considered
as stable spin alignments, and the calculated results of polaron formation
and ion diffusion for these two cases are similar;29 therefore, we chose the FM configuration for convenience.
The stable structure in the FM alignment was fully optimized by the
HSE06 method and used hereafter in our calculation.

Figure 1 Crystal structure of
Na2Mn3(SO4)4. The purple
octahedrons and yellow tetrahedrons stand
for MnO6 and SO4 groups, respectively. The yellow
balls are the symbols of Na atoms.

The lattice parameters are listed in Table 1. The data show a good agreement between
calculations and experiments. The calculated lattice parameters by
HSE06 show a good agreement with experiments. Along the [001] direction,
each MnO6 group shares its two axial O corners with two
other MnO6 groups to form zigzag chains. Each MnO6 octahedron also shares an edge with one SO4 tetrahedron.
Moreover, each chain connects to the others through the small chains
(−SO4–MnO6−)3 and (−SO4–MnO6–MnO6–SO4−), which arrange along the [100]
direction. The MnO6–MnO6 dimmer links
with each other via sharing an O ion with the SO4 group.
The complex three-dimensional framework created by the MnO6 and SO4 groups forms tunnels along the [001] direction
in which Na ions are inserted.

In the framework of Na2Mn3(SO4)4, two types of distorted
MnO6 octahedron
with different Mn–O bond lengths and O–Mn–O bond
angles are distinguished. Table 2 shows the bond lengths of Mn–O in these octahedrons.
The bond lengths in the first type of Mn(1)O6 are in the
range of (2.067–2.345) Å, whereas the bond lengths of
the second one are from 2.066 to 2.496 Å, the longest bond of
which is significantly longer than that of the first one. As a result,
the average bond length of the former type is 2.163 Å, which
is 0.016 Å shorter than that of the latter. Using the formula
of the degree of distortion, Δ = 1/6∑n=1,6{(dn –
⟨d⟩)/⟨d⟩}2, where dn and d are the MnO bond length and the average one, respectively.11 The degree of distortion (Δ) of the Mn(1)O6 octahedron (∼2 × 10–3) is smaller
than that of Mn(2)O6 (∼4 × 10–3). The first Mn(1)O6 type creates a dimer [Mn(1)2O11] and an alternative (−SO4–Mn(1)O6−)3 along the [100] direction. On the other
hand, the second Mn(2)O6 groups are connected by sharing
two O atoms at two opposite axial sites to set up an infinite zigzag
chain [Mn(2)O10] along the [001] direction.

Figure 2 illustrates
the density of states (DOSs) of FM Na2Mn3(SO4)4 calculated by the HSE06 method. As shown in Figure 2a, the states of
oxygen 2p electrons dominantly distribute to the valence band (VB),
whereas the 3p electrons of S occupy states in an energy region lower
than −7.0 eV. The 3d orbitals of Mn occupy mainly the conduction
band and the state just below the Fermi level. Therefore, the 3d orbitals
of Mn ions would primarily determine the electronic properties of
this material. The calculated band gaps of the up-spin and down-spin
channels of Na2Mn3(SO4)4 are 5.9 and 7.8 eV, respectively. Previously, Gao et al.21 used the GGA method and obtained the band gap
of 2.23 eV for this material. It is well known that the GGA method
considerably underestimates the band gap of compounds in which the
3d electrons play an important role.30 In
the present calculation, the HSE06 method gives a large band gap of
5.9 eV for this material. The large band gap is thought to have little
effect on the conductivity of the material;31 also, it can prevent the process of generating particles because
of the absorption of electromagnetic waves or phonons.

structure with a Na vacancy. The black,
red, blue, orange, and green colors indicate the total and partial
DOSs of Mn, O, S, and Na, respectively.

Voltage
The voltage of Na2Mn3(SO4)4 is defined by the following formula 1  where E[Na2–xMn3(SO4)4] and E[Na] are the total energies of Na2–xMn3(SO4)4 and Na
metal, respectively, and e is the absolute electron
charge. The two-step redox potentials corresponding to the processes
Mn2+ to Mn3+ (for x = 2, y = 1) and Mn3+ to Mn4+ (x = 1, y = 0) are 4.3 and 4.5 V, respectively. The
redox potential of the process Mn2+ to Mn4+ (x = 2, y = 0) is 4.4 V, which is consistent
with the previous work.21 These results
suggest that the average open-circuit voltage of Na2Mn3(SO4)4 can gain 4.4 V.

Formation of
Small Polaron
A quasi-particle, the so-called
small polaron,23 which forms because of
the defect caused by the removal or insertion of Na ions during charging/discharging
processes, may strongly affect the diffusion mechanism of Na ions.
In the cathode materials, when an electron or a hole is introduced
into the material, a small polaron would form. In Na2–xMn3(SO4)4, when
a Na atom is removed, a hole is introduced in the system, leading
to the fact that the nearest Mn2+ ion is oxidized to Mn3+, which causes a local distortion in the MnO6 octahedron
because of the shrinking of the Mn–O bond lengths. Hence, a
charge carrier (hole) would be self-trapped at the Mn3+ site, that is, a small polaron forms at this position, as stated
in previous works.8,9,26−29

In order to find the polaron site, we calculate the Mn–O
bond lengths and the magnetic moment of the nearest Mn ions to the
vacancy. There are three nearest-neighbor Mn ions (denoted as 1NN,
2NN, and 3NN) around a Na ion at distances of 3.473, 3.486, and 3.642
Å, respectively. When a Na ion is deintercalated, there is a
significant change at the 3NN Mn site, that is, the average bond length
Mn–O is shrunk from 2.16 to 2.03 Å and the Mn magnetic
moment decreases from 3.77 to 2.94 μB. It implies
that a local distortion appears around the 3NN site and a hole is
self-trapped at this site. It should be noted here that, in order
to find exactly the site where the polaron favorably forms, one should
compare the total energies of three configurations corresponding to
the formation of polaron at 1NN, 2NN, and 3NN to the Na vacancy, respectively.
Our calculation for the three cases of polaron formation at 1NN, 2NN,
and 3NN to the Na vacancy shows that the total energy of the polaron
formed at the 3NN site is considerably lower than those at 1NN and
2NN by an amount of 219 and 74 meV, respectively. In addition, it
should be emphasized that, similar to olivine phosphate LiMnPO4,26 because of the overestimation of orbital delocalization,
GGA + U fails in describing the bound states of 3d
Mn ions in the vacancy structure. Figure S2 shows the clean band gap without any bound state, which is caused
by the local distortion and the oxidization of Mn ion from Mn2+ to Mn3+ when a Na ion is removed. It suggests
that GGA + U (and GGA) may underestimate the activation
energy of Na diffusion because it ignores the polaron contribution
in diffusion processes.

The change in crystal structure results
in a substantial adjustment
in the electronic structure. Figure 2b shows the DOS of the defect structure with the removal
of a Na ion. As can be seen in Figure 2b, five sharp peaks of DOS appear in the band gap.
Four sharp peaks of down-spins are caused by the Jahn–Teller
deformation effect of the Mn+3O6 octahedron.
One peak of up-spin at a lower energy level in the band gap is the
d state shifting from the VB because of a hole introduction. The appearance
of this spin-up peak is caused by the shifting of one electron of
3NN Mn to the Na vacancy from its state below the Fermi level to occupy
a bound state inside the band gap, resulting in the change of oxidation
of 3NN Mn2+ ion to 3+. Hence, the peak at the lowest energy
(1.6 eV) indicates the occurrence of a bound state reflecting the
formation of a polaron accompanying to the Na vacancy. To conclude,
the changes in the crystal and electronic structure provide convincing
evidence that one small polaron forms at the Mn third-nearest neighbor
to the Na vacancy when a Na vacancy appears in Na2Mn3(SO4)4.

Diffusion Mechanism
Finally, we investigate the diffusion
mechanism of Na ion in the full discharge state. For this aim, we
first determine all of the possible EDPs inside this material. Diffusion
of Na ion is considered as a complex process of Na vacancy and its
accompanying polaron. The hypothesis of EDPs of Na vacancy–small
polaron complexes26 is applied to explore
the Na-ion diffusion inside the material. According to Dinh et al.,26 there are three kinds of EDP occurring in the
cathode materials; the parallel (crossing) process occurs when the
polaron hopping path from a Mn site to the adjacent Mn site is parallel
(crossly) to the Na vacancy diffusion direction. On the other hand,
the single process takes place when the polaron does not hop during
the Na vacancy movement. Based on the arrangement of the Na ion and
polyanion framework in the symmetrical crystal structure of Na2Mn3(SO4)4, it is obvious
that the single process could not occur. Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate
the pathway and activation energy profile of the EDPs, respectively.
Four feasible EDPs between two adjacent Na vacancies were considered.

Figure 3 Possible
EDPs in the material considered: (a) parallel process
p1, (b) parallel process p2, (c) crossing process c1, and (d) crossing
process c2. Green balls demonstrate the trace of Na ions along the
diffusion pathways. Green MnO6 octahedron illustrates the
initial and final sites where the accompanying polaron forms during
the diffusion of Na vacancy. The black arrows point the small polaron
accompanying the corresponding Na vacancy.

Figure 4 Activation
energy of the polaron–Na vacancy complex diffusion
in Na2Mn3(SO4)4. The orange,
blue, red, and green curves demonstrate the activation energy profile
of two parallel (p1, p2) and two crossing (c1, c2) processes, respectively.

Process p1: As illustrated by Figure 3a, Na vacancy migrates from
the Na1 site
to Na6 site, whereas the polaron hops from the Mn8 to Mn3 site in
parallel with the direction of Na diffusion. This process is a parallel
process with the reaction coordinate of 7.2 Å and activation
energy of 864 meV, as demonstrated by the curve 16-p1 of Figure 4.

Process p2:
In the process illustrated in Figure 3b, the Na vacancy diffuses from the Na1 site
to Na4 site with a distance of 7.1 Å, whereas the accompanying
polaron hops from the Mn5 site to the Mn8 site in parallel with the
moving direction of Na. This process is a parallel process with an
activation energy of 1.190 eV (curve 14-p2 of Figure 4).

Process c1: Figure 3c demonstrates the process in which the polaron
jumps from the Mn8
site to the Mn1 site during the movement of Na vacancy from the Na1
site to the Na8 site. The reaction coordinate of the diffusing path
of Na ion is 9.5 Å. Because the hopping path of the polaron crosses
the moving way of Na vacancy, this process is treated as a crossing
process. Overall, the activation energy required for this EDP is 1.078
eV (curve 18-c1 of Figure 4).

Process c2: Figure 3d illustrates the other crossing process which takes
place when a
Na vacancy diffuses from the Na6 site to the Na8 site and the polaron
jumps from the Mn3 to Mn1 site. Within the distance of 8.3 Å,
the activation energy is 852 meV (curve 68-c2 of Figure 4).

The diffusion pathways
of Na ions in the whole material can be
explored by combining the preferable EDPs. Clearly, the process c2
needs the lowest activation energy of 852 meV for Na vacancy diffusion;
hence, c2 would be the most preferable EDP. The repetition of process
c2 creates a zigzag-like diffusion path along the [001] direction,
as illustrated in Figure 5, forming the most favorable diffusion pathway of Na ions
in this compound. Diffusion of Na ion along this pathway has an activation
energy of 852 meV, which is consistent with the experimental value
(620 meV at 300 K) measured by the impedance spectroscopy measurement
and the BVM method.21 In addition, it should
be noted that the GGA + U method underestimates the
activation energy, whereas HSE06 slightly overestimates it; hence,
the experimental value can be predicted to be slightly lower than
the calculated one. Compared with olivine phosphate LiFePO4 which possesses an activation energy of 630 meV, Na2Mn3(SO4)4 would possess quite similar electrochemical
properties.

illustrated by green octahedrons MO6 and the trace of the
moving Na ion is demonstrated by small green balls.

Conclusions
We have systematically investigated the
crystal structure, electronic
structure, the formation of polaron, and explored the diffusion mechanism
of Na ions in Na2Mn3(SO4)4 by employing an accurate calculation method (hybrid functional method
HSE06). At the ground state, Na2Mn3(SO4)4 was predicted to be stable in FM and AFM states. The
achievable voltage of the material is 4.4 V. As a Na ion is removed
from the system, a small polaron would form and contribute to the
diffusion process of the Na ion. A polaron was found to form at the
Mn third-nearest neighbor to the Na vacancy. As the Na vacancy diffuses,
the accompanying polaron would simultaneously migrate via the four
elementary diffusion processes: two parallel and two crossing processes.
Among these processes, the crossing process c2 is the favorable one
because of its lowest activation energy. Na ions in this material
favorably diffuse along a zigzag-like path along the [001] direction,
with an activation energy of 852 meV. Possessing a high operating
voltage and a diffusion pathway with an activation energy relatively
compared with olivine phosphate, Na2Mn3(SO4)4 is expected as a promising candidate for cathode
materials of rechargeable sodium-ion batteries.

Computational Method
Present calculations are based on the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof
hybrid functional HSE06 method implemented in the Vienna Ab initio
package.32−34 The hybrid functional HSE06 method approximates the
exchange correlation energy ExcHSE by incorporating a certain
amount of the exact exchange Hartree–Fock (HF) energy ExHF with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation
energy determined by DFT in the following form 2  where a is the mixing coefficient,
and ExPBE and EcPBE are the PBE exchange and correlation energies,
respectively.

By eliminating the compensated HF and PBE long-ranged
exchange
contribution, the following form of ExcHSE is derived29 3  where
LR and SR indicate the long-ranged and
short-ranged contributions, respectively, and w is
an adjustable parameter handling the short-ranged interaction. HSE06
uses a = 0.25 and w = 0.2. We employ
the HSE06 method because this method can provide an accurate result
in calculating the electronic structure of the compounds containing
the transition-metal elements.26 Especially,
HSE06 is an efficient method in describing the bound states because
of the local distortion caused by the removal or insertion of a Na
ion, whereas the other methods such as GGA and GGA + U might fall.26 As the diffusion of Na
ions is affected by the quasi-particle, that is, the so-called small
polaron, which forms because of the local distortion, in order to
explore accurately the diffusion mechanism of Na ions, the HSE06 method
should be employed. The projector augmented-wave method was employed
to describe ion–electron interactions.34 A cutoff energy of 400 eV was chosen. A 1 × 2 × 2 k-point mesh was used with respect to the supercell containing
four formula units (100 atoms). The convergence condition of the optimization
calculations is reached when the residual force was smaller than 0.001
eV/Å.

To reveal the diffusion mechanism inside this material,
we first
find out the stable magnetic alignments of magnetic ions and correspondingly
the most stable configuration of the system. After this, we calculate
the optimized geometrical and electronic structures of the most stable
configuration. The voltage is derived and compared with the experimental
value. The diffusion of Na ion is revealed through the following process:
first, the formation of a small polaron accompanying a Na vacancy
is explored through the optimization of the defect structure; second,
four possible EDPs in which the movement of Na ion is accompanied
by the polaron migration are carried out, and the activation energy Ea of each possible EDP is calculated by using
the nudge elastic band method;35 finally,
the favorable diffusion pathways in the whole material were explored
by combining these EDP processes.
