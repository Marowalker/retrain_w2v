Organofunctional
silanes are applied as coupling agents between
organic coatings and low carbon steel substrates to promote adhesion.
Although the metal oxide–silane interface plays an important
role in the performance of the entire overlying coating system, it
remains challenging to obtain a clear understanding of the interfacial
molecular bonding mechanism and its influence on adhesion. In this
work, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry is used to study
interfacial interactions between aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APS)
and low carbon steel. APS is shown to bond to the steel substrate
through silanol steel and amine–steel interactions, and coatings
are cured at varying temperatures to evaluate the influence of curing
on these different types of bonding interactions. Unambiguous evidence
for hydrogen bond interactions between APS silanol groups and steel
surface hydroxyl groups is provided for the first time in this work
through deuteration of the steel substrate and allows to tackle long-lasting
doubts about the most wide-spread bonding theory that has been postulated
for silane adsorption on metals.

1 Introduction
Organic coatings are generally
applied to metal substrates to add
corrosion protection and other application-oriented surface properties
in a wide range of industries such as construction, aerospace, automotive,
packaging, and biomedical healthcare. An important challenge in the
industrial coating process is to obtain strong adhesion between the
organic primer coating and the metal substrate. Application of the
primer coating is mostly preceded by metal surface treatments to enhance
adhesion and corrosion protection. Classic pretreatments on (galvanized)
steel substrates involved chromate conversion coating and zinc phosphating,
but the corrosion protection scheme of steel substrates has undergone
a large transition in the last twenty–thirty years. Restrictions
on the use of aforementioned environmentally unfriendly systems have
been a major driver in this transition, leading to a vast amount of
research toward alternative treatments. One of those alternative treatments
was found in the application of organofunctional silanes as adhesion
promotors.

Organosilanes are referred to as coupling agents
because of their
ability to attach strongly to metal oxide surfaces as well as to organic
coatings. A lot of importance is given to the organic–inorganic
interface, given that the hybrid interface is crucial to the performance
of the entire coating system. Many studies have been directed toward
characterization of interfacial bonding at the metal oxide–silane
interface by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)1−3 and time-of-flight
secondary ion spectrometry (ToF-SIMS).2−7 ToF-SIMS was shown to be most successful to extract information
of interfacial chemistry. Gettings and Kinloch studied the organosilane–steel
interface and reported an ionic fragment with a nominal mass of 100
u, which could be assigned to SiOFe+.4 Bexell and Olsson reported a fragment at nominal mass 109
u, characteristic for a silane–zinc interface, which could
be assigned to SiOZn+.5 Several
studies involving silane adsorption on aluminum reported a similar
fragment at nominal mass 71 u, which could be assigned to SiOAl+.2,3,5−7 All these SiOM+ fragments, where M stands for metal,
were seen as direct evidence for interactions between silanes and
metal oxides through formation of covalent metal siloxane bonds. These
observations support the bonding mechanism of silanes proposed by
Plueddemann,8 which has been widely acknowledged
in the literature and is illustrated in Figure 1. Most used silane compounds contain alkoxy
groups, which in presence of water, hydrolyze into silanol groups
(−Si–OH) (Figure 1a). Depending on solution parameters such as the solvent,
silane concentration, and pH, condensation reactions can occur between
two silanols groups, leading to the formation of oligomeric or polymeric
structures through siloxane (−Si–O–Si−)
bonds (Figure 1b).
When the silane solution comes into contact with the metal substrate,
silanol groups interact with surface hydroxyl groups through formation
of hydrogen bonds (Figure 1c) or by formation of a covalent metal oxane bond (−M–O–Si−).
It is suggested that an equilibrium exists between these two bonding
configurations after the substrate is removed from the silane solution.
Upon drying at room temperature and even more by applying additional
heat in a curing step, covalent metal siloxane bonds are formed through
a condensation reaction8 (Figure 1d). Covalent interactions are
stronger than hydrogen bond interactions and therefore more desirable
with respect to adhesion.9

Figure 1 Interfacial bonding mechanism
of silanes to a metal surface as
it has been often described in the literature, based on the mechanism
proposed by Plueddemann.8 X represents
hydrolysable alkoxy groups, Y represents an organofunctional group,
and M represents a metal.

Although the bonding mechanism illustrated in Figure 1 has been often cited in the
literature, reactions (c,d) in the mechanism, which involve the actual
interactions between the silanes and the substrate, are still under
debate. On the one hand, it is questioned whether SiOM+ fragments obtained from ToF-SIMS measurements can be considered
as sufficient evidence for covalent bonding.3,10 On
the other hand, direct evidence for hydrogen bond interactions at
the metal oxide–silane interface has never been provided. In
this work, ToF-SIMS will be applied to study the bonding mechanism
of aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APS) on steel. State-of-the-art ToF-SIMS
instrumentation, with a mass resolution of 8000 at 29 u (Si+), allows for a detailed analysis of the interface. Although the
surface hydroxyl groups of the steel substrate are very likely to
play an important role in the bonding mechanism of silanes,8 their specific role has always been difficult
to probe. Therefore, to highlight the interactions in which they are
involved, surface hydroxyl groups will be replaced by surface deuteroxide
groups. APS contains three ethoxy groups on one side and an amine
functionality on the other side (Figure 2). Through its amine group, APS is able to
provide good adhesion to epoxies, polyurethanes, and phenolic-based
primer coatings,11 but one should consider
that this amine group might also interact with the steel substrate.
Amine-steel interfacial interactions have been characterized before
by Wielant et al. with XPS.12 It was shown
that interactions with the substrate occur either through Lewis acid–base
interactions, in which there is a donation of nitrogen lone-pair electron
density to metal cationic sites, or through Brønsted acid–base
interactions, in which amine groups get protonated by surface hydroxyl
groups from the substrate (Figure 3). The main difficulty to probe these interactions
with XPS is however that unbound amine groups and Lewis-bonded amine
groups give a similar response in XPS binding energies.12 In this work, it will be evaluated how ToF-SIMS
can be used to differentiate between different types of amine steel
interactions. Different types of interactions can occur at the steel
oxide–silane interface; covalent −M–O–Si–
are stronger than amine–steel interactions, and therefore more
desired with respect to adhesion.8 Finally,
it has been investigated how variations in curing temperatures influence
the interfacial chemistry at the steel oxide–silane interface.
The curing temperature is an important parameter in the industrial
coating process.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Silane Solution Preparation
A 2 v
% silane solution was prepared at room temperature by adding APS (99
atom. %, Sigma-Aldrich) to a solvent mixture of Milli-Q water and
methanol (≥ 99.5 atom. %, VWR Chemicals). A 90/10 (v %/v %)
water/methanol ratio was chosen, based on a study by Ghosh et al.
that evaluated the solvent composition with respect to solution stability
and adhesion performance on stainless steel.13 Wet deposition took place after 1 h of hydrolysis under continuous
stirring. The silane solution was always used at its natural alkaline
pH (10.4) during the deposition.

2.2 Substrate
Preparation
Low carbon
cold-rolled steel sheets with a thickness of 500 μm were cut
into coupons of 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 and polished with diamond
paste to 0.1 μm roughness. Coupons are cleaned in an ultrasonic
bath of ethanol and rinsed with ethanol and milliQ water. Coupons
are immersed for 10 min in an 80 wt % NaOH solution at 70 °C.
This alkaline pretreatment is based on a study by Wielant et al. on
iron oxides12 and is applied to form surface
oxide layers in controllable and reproducible conditions. Deuterated
surface oxide layers are generated by immersion of coupons for 10
min in a 40 wt % sodium deuteroxide solution (40 wt % NaOD in D2O (99.5 atom. % D), Sigma-Aldrich) at 70 °C. After the
alkaline treatment, coupons are rinsed with Milli-Q water and dried
with N2.

2.3 Silane Deposition
Ultrathin layers
of APS were deposited on the steel coupon by immersion into the APS
solution for 15 min. After immersion, samples were rinsed with ethanol
and dried with N2. Samples were cured in an oven at 180
°C at varying residence times, resulting in different peak metal
temperatures (PMTs). A thermocouple was used to determine the relation
between residence time and PMT (Table 1).

2.4 ToF-SIMS
Measurements
ToF-SIMS measurements
were performed with a TOF.SIMS 5 system from ION-TOF GmbH (Münster,
Germany), using a 30 keV Bi3+ primary ion beam
operated in the high current bunched mode for high mass resolution
(approximately 8000 at 29 u (29Si+)). The lateral
resolution achieved in the high current bunched mode is 3 μm.
The pulsed ion beam target current was approximately 0.70 pA. Positive
ion mass spectra were acquired over a mass range of 1–800 u
and calibrated using a list of fragments of known composition. The
accuracy of a mass assignment (in ppm) is calculated by taking the
absolute difference between the experimental and theoretical mass
of a fragment and dividing this number by the experimental mass. Mass
spectra were obtained by rastering areas of 100 μm × 100
μm, at 128 × 128 pixels. The analysis time was 60 s, keeping
the total ion dose below the static limit of 1 × 1013 ions cm–2 analysis–1.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Direct Interface Analysis
A pretreated
steel substrate and a steel substrate covered with APS were analyzed
by ToF-SIMS. Figure 4a shows the spectra in the 0–99 m/z mass range, and Figure 4b shows the 99–210 m/z mass range. More detailed extracts from fragments of interest
are presented in Figure 5, where an overlay of three spectra per condition is given to demonstrate
the excellent reproducibility of the measurements. Figure 5a shows that Fe+, with a decreased intensity as compared to uncoated steel, is still
strongly present on APS-coated steel. Figure 5b shows APS characteristic fragments Si+ and CH2N+. Given that the depth information
from a ToF-SIMS surface analysis falls within the range of 1–5
nm,14 one can conclude from the simultaneous
presence of APS and substrate fragments that the obtained APS film
thickness is lower than 5 nm. Consequently, interfacial fragments
between the organic layer and the iron oxide are extracted as well.
SiOFe+ is a fragment that has been often reported in the
literature as a proof for covalent bonding4 and is also present in the steel-APS spectrum at a nominal mass
of 100 u. Besides SiOFe+, also SiO2HFe+, SiO3HFe+, and SiO4HFe2+ are characteristic for the steel-APS spectrum (Figure 4b). A detailed spectrum
of SiOFe+ is given in Figure 5c. CH4NFe+ is a fragment
found at nominal mass 86 u and clearly indicates that amine–steel
interactions are taking place at the interface as well (Figure 5d).

3.2 Silanol-Surface Hydroxyl Interactions
Surface
hydroxyl groups on metal substrates are known to play a major
role in the bonding mechanism of organic compounds,12,15,16 but are not easily probed. In this work,
deuterium is applied to investigate the role of surface hydroxyl groups
in the adsorption mechanism of APS. Basically, steel substrates were
pretreated with NaOD instead of NaOH in order to form surface deuteroxide
groups instead of hydroxyl groups. Hereafter, a steel substrate pretreated
with NaOH will be referred to as H-steel and a substrate pretreated
with NaOD will be referred to as D-steel. Figure 6 compares H-steel with D-steel. In the negative
polarity ToF-SIMS spectra, an OD– peak is only present
for the spectrum obtained on D-steel (Figure 6a). Given that all coupons were rinsed with
Milli-Q water after the alkaline treatment to remove any NaOH or NaOD
precipitates, this is a first indication that deuteroxide anions have
reacted with the surface. In positive polarity, the FeOH+ peak at a nominal mass of 73 u (Figure 6b) is found with comparable intensities on
both samples. However, a significant increase in intensity on D-steel
is observed for a peak originally assigned to FeOH2+ (Figure 6c).
This intensity increase can be attributed to FeOD+ and
shows that a certain amount of surface deuteroxide groups were created
on D-steel, among surface hydroxyl groups which also remain present,
as illustrated in Figure 6d. Surface hydroxyl groups on D-steel may have been there
already before the alkaline treatment, or they may have been formed
during rinsing with Milli-Q water after the alkaline treatment.

in red. (a) OD– (b) FeOH+ (c) FeOH2+/FeOD+. Three spectra are shown for
each condition. (d) Steel surface treated with NaOH (left), steel
surface treated with NaOD (right).

After an evaluation of the two pretreatments, both types of substrates
were covered with APS and analyzed with ToF-SIMS. Figure 7 gives an overlay of mass spectra
obtained on H-steel, D-steel, APS-coated H-steel, and APS-coated D-steel.
While SiOH+ (at 45 u) shows comparable intensities on APS-coated
H-steel and D-steel (Figure 7a), an additional peak shows up at a nominal mass of 46 u
on APS-coated D-steel (Figure 7b). The latter peak can be identified as SiOD+ and
provides direct evidence that an interaction is taking place between
silanol groups of APS and the surface hydroxyl groups on steel. A
similar isotope pair is found at nominal masses 79 and 80 u, where
two peaks are attributed to SiO3H3+ and SiO3H2D+, respectively (Figure 7c,d). SiOD+ and SiO3H2D+ are two fragments
indicative for hydrogen bond interactions between silanol groups and
surface hydroxyl groups. This becomes clear from the illustrations
in Figure 8, where
hydrogen bond interactions are shown on the left-hand side and covalent
bond interactions on the right-hand side. One can conclude from this
experiment that the SiOH+ and SiO3H3+ peaks obtained on APS-coated H-steel contain a certain
contribution from hydrogen bond interactions with the substrate. SiO3H3+ is more exclusively linked to hydrogen
bond interactions as compared to SiOH+ because SiOH+ can originate from hydrogen bond interactions as well as
from covalent bond interactions (Figure 8). This explains why the intensity drop upon
deuteration of the substrate is more pronounced for SiO3H3+ and less for SiOH+ (Figure 7a,c).

of hydrogen bond interactions (left) and covalent
interactions (right) between APS and steel.

At a nominal mass of 135 u, a peak present on APS-coated steel
is attributed to SiO3H3Fe+ (Figure 9a). Given that the
ratio of oxygen to hydrogen in this fragment is 1:1, it is unlikely
that this fragment is attributed to covalent bonding. The shoulder
on a peak observed at 136 u for APS coated D-steel suggests that surface
hydroxyl groups are involved in this fragment (Figure 9b). Although at this point it is difficult
to assign this fragment to one single structure unambiguously, it
is likely that this fragment is largely attributed to hydrogen bond
interactions.

3.3 Amine–Steel Interactions
At
a nominal mass of 86 u, a peak attributed to CH4NFe+ indicates that amine–steel interactions are taking
place at the interface (Figure 10a). CH4NFe+ intensities on APS
coated H-steel are comparable to those obtained on APS-coated D-steel.
The absence of oxygen in the fragment tells us that the interaction
occurs between the free electron pair of nitrogen and iron. This corresponds
to Lewis type acid–base interactions, as described in the literature12 and illustrated in Figure 10a. On APS-coated D-steel, an additional
peak found at a nominal mass of 32 u is attributed to CH4DN+ (Figure 10b). This fragment indicates that amine groups of APS are protonated
through an acid–base interaction with the steel surface hydroxyl
groups. This type of interaction is known as a Brønsted type
acid–base interaction and is illustrated in Figure 10b.

in red, APS-coated H-steel in green, and APS-coated D-steel in blue.

Lewis type acid–base interactions (b) CH4DN+, significantly present on APS-coated D-steel, indicates protonation

are shown for each condition.

3.4 Influence of Curing on Interfacial Bonding
APS coated H-steel samples were cured at varying PMTs to investigate
the influence of curing on interface interactions. Different residence
times in an oven at 180 °C lead to a variation of PMTs from 25
to 180 °C. Figure 11a shows the intensity variations for 30Si+. From 25 to 100 °C, 30Si+ intensities
are relatively comparable. Between 100 and 150 °C, a sudden decrease
in intensity is observed. This significant intensity drop is not only
observed for 30Si+ but for all APS characteristic
fragments. Studies in the literature on the influence of curing temperature
on thick (>100 nm) APS and bis-1,2-(triethoxysilyl)ethane (BTSE)
coatings
reported a thickness decrease and densification of the coatings in
the 100–200 °C temperature range,17,18 attributed to cross-linking of silanol groups which condensate to
siloxane (−Si–O–Si−) chains (Figure 1d). Below 100 °C,
cross-linking did not occur.

Figure 11 ToF-SIMS intensities of fragments of interest
obtained on APS-coated
H-steel in function of PMT during a curing step. (a) Si+ and (b) 54Fe+ intensities normalized to total.

From this information, the significant decrease
in intensities
for APS characteristic fragments can be explained by a change of the
chemical matrix. In ToF-SIMS, secondary ion intensities are influenced
by the chemical composition of the surrounding matrix material (SIMS
matrix effect). Although ToF-SIMS cannot provide intrinsic quantitative
data because of the SIMS matrix effect, it is possible to compare
analyses of samples with similar chemistry.19 APS coatings treated in the temperature range 25–100 °C
are not cross-linked and thus can be easily compared. For APS coatings
treated at higher temperatures (150–180 °C), one should
bear in mind that the chemical matrix has changed because of cross-linking,
which seems to result in a significant intensity decrease of APS characteristic
fragments. Figure 11b shows the intensity variations for 54Fe+,
a substrate fragment. 54Fe+ intensities are
significantly lower on coated samples as compared to the steel substrate.
Amongst the coated samples, slightly increased 54Fe+ intensities are observed for samples treated at 150–180
°C. This can also be explained by a densification and decrease
in thickness of APS layers in this temperature range.

When SiO3H3+ intensities are plotted
against PMT, a clear trend becomes visible (Figure 12a). The highest SiO3H3+ intensity is found at 25 °C and gradually decreases
when temperature increases to 75 °C. Between 75 and 100 °C,
its intensity appears to remain relatively constant. At 150 °C,
the SiO3H3+ intensity decreases again.
Remarkably, SiO3H3Fe+ shows the exact
same trend as SiO3H3+ (Figure 12b), which points
out that both fragments are structurally related. Because it was shown
in a previous section that SiO3H3+ is largely attributed to hydrogen bond interactions at the interface,
one can assume that the trend observed for both fragments gives us
direct information about hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bond interactions
seem to be most present in the absence of any heat treatment but are
strongly diminished by heating to up to 75 °C. The additional
intensity drop observed at 150 °C is likely attributed to loss
of adsorbed APS species because of volatilization. SiOFe+ intensities are plotted against PMT in Figure 12c but do not show a clear trend. SiOFe+ intensities seem to be largely affected by the amount of
Si or coverage of APS, as a large correlation exists with the 30Si+ intensities plotted in Figure 11a. However, a significant difference with
respect to the 30Si+ intensities is that the
highest SiOFe+ intensity is observed at 25 °C. This
result seems contradictory to the literature, where SiOFe+ is reported as evidence for covalent bonding4 because Figure 12a,b just showed that the amount of hydrogen bonding is highest at
25 °C. A possible explanation for this observation may be that
hydrogen bond interactions and covalent bond interactions are both
forming SiOFe+ in their fragmentation patterns. This means
that one should not assume that SiOFe+ is a pure evidence
for covalent bonding. However, to subtract the contribution from hydrogen
bonding, SiOFe+ intensities can be normalized to SiO3H3Fe+ intensities (Figure 12d). Relative to SiO3H3Fe+, SiOFe+ intensities are highest
after heating up to 75–100 °C. As this trend is now solely
attributed to covalent bonding, one can conclude that the number of
covalent bonds is relatively low at low temperatures (25–50
°C) but increases significantly in the temperature range 75–100
°C. This means that condensation reactions at the hybrid interface,
which convert the hydrogen bond interactions to covalent −Si–O–Fe–
bonds, occur at lower temperatures than the cross-linking of silanol
groups in the bulk of the coating.

interest obtained on APS-coated
H-steel in function of PMT during a curing step. (a) SiO3H3+ and (b) FeSiO3H3+ intensities normalized to total. (c) SiOFe+ intensities
normalized to total and (d) SiOFe+ intensities normalized
to SiO3H3Fe+.

CH4NFe+ intensities plotted against PMT in Figure 13a show a clear
trend. CH4NFe+ intensities are highest at 25
°C and gradually decrease with increasing curing temperature.
Therefore, one can state that Lewis type acid–base interactions
at the interface diminish with increasing curing temperature. Brønsted
acid–base interactions between the APS amine groups and steel
surface hydroxyl groups are represented by CH5N+ (Figure 13b). Brønsted
acid–base interactions are most present at 50 °C but seem
to diminish significantly at higher curing temperatures.

4 Conclusions
Although for a very long time it has been postulated that hydrogen
bonding occurs at the silane-metal oxide interface, direct evidence
for hydrogen bond interactions has been provided in this work for
the first time. Deuteration of steel surface hydroxyl groups allowed
us to distinguish between interactions attributed to hydrogen bonding
and covalent bond interactions. One must be careful with interpretation
of SiOFe+, a fragment that has been repeatedly reported
in the literature as evidence for covalent bonding, as it was shown
that both hydrogen bonding and covalent bonding contribute to SiOFe+ intensities. ToF-SIMS may not be able to quantify these multiple
interactions in an absolute way, but can indicate how certain interactions
evolve in function of a varying process parameter. This was shown
by varying the curing temperature. Hydrogen bond interactions were
most present in the absence of curing and gradually diminish upon
curing to 75 °C. To a similar extent, the amount of covalent
interactions increases with increasing curing temperatures up to 75
°C. These observations confirm the theory that hydrogen bond
interactions are converted to covalent bond interactions through a
condensation reaction which is promoted by applying heat. Evidence
for amine–steel interactions is also found in the form of the
Lewis type and Brønsted type acid–base interactions. Both
interactions were shown to diminish with increasing curing temperature.
The curing of silane coatings is an important industrial step in view
of promoting interfacial adhesion and coating barrier properties.
Barrier properties are improved by condensation of silanol groups,
resulting in a cross-linked −Si–O–Si–
siloxane network. Covalent −Si–O–Fe– interfacial
bonds are favorable over hydrogen bond interactions and amine–steel
interactions in terms of adhesion performance. This work points out
that condensation reactions at the hybrid interface, which convert
the hydrogen bond interactions to covalent −Si–O–Fe–
bonds, occur at lower temperatures (50–75 °C) than the
cross-linking of silanol groups in the bulk of the coating, which
only occurs at temperatures above 100 °C.
