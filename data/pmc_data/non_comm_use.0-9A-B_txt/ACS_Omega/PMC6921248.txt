The effect of particle size and electronic percolation
on low-temperature
power performance in the lithium titanate (LTO) cell is reported.
Particle size and carbon contents in negative electrodes are systematically
controlled to understand ionic and electronic contribution. The LTO
cell with a small particle size, that is, high surface area, showed
superior power performance, while additional electronic percolation
did not improve the performance at −30 °C when coupled
with a lithium manganese spinel cathode. The results are supported
by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, which indicate
that smaller LTO particles exhibit lower charge transfer-related impedance
and guide rational design and fabrication of electrode architectures
at low temperature.

1 Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries
based on spinel-structured lithium titanium
oxide, Li4Ti5O12 (LTO), have been
of significant interest for an alternative anode material especially
for high power applications because of operation voltage (1.55 V vs
Li/Li+) above electrolyte reduction potentials and lithium
plating potential.1,2 Furthermore, intrinsic structural
stability and negligible volume change during lithiation and delithiation
process enable extremely long cycle life compared to batteries with
graphitic anodes.3−5 Fast charging/discharging ability makes LTO attractive
for low voltage and high power batteries including 12 V start–stop
batteries for vehicle application.

One of the challenges associated
with 12 V start–stop application
is the ability to start the engine at −30 °C, cold cranking
capability,6 as lithium-ion batteries suffer
drastic power loss at temperatures below 0 °C. According to United
States Automotive Battery Consortium (USABC), battery pack voltage
should be higher than 8 V during three 4.5 s pulses (6 kW for 0.5
s followed by 4 kW for 4 s) at −30 °C, simulating the
start of cold engine. Research to improve performance of lithium-ion
batteries at low temperature has focused on development of highly
conductive electrolytes and the use of nanostructured electrodes to
facilitate transport of lithium ions between and/or within the electrodes.4,7,8 For example, Amine et al. demonstrated
high-power battery with lithium manganese oxide (LMO)/nanostructured
LTO (∼10 nm primary nanoparticles on micron size secondary
particle) electrodes that outperformed their LMO/graphite counterparts.
In addition, LMO/nanostructured LTO cells showed excellent 5 kW cold
cranking power performance at −30 °C, where voltage drop
after 5 kW 2 s pulse was 0.75 and 1.5 V for LTO and graphite based
cells, respectively. The LTO-based cells in the report indeed have
attracted attention for potential battery systems for hybrid electric
vehicles.4 Pohjalainen et al. also reported
the effect of LTO particle size on low-temperature performance, and
LTO with high surface area showed improved power capability at −20
°C.8

Despite promising developments
of lithium-ion batteries based on
LTO anodes, there is limited information in terms of rational design
of LTO-based cells such as which electrodes (anode or cathode) limit
power capability and rate-limiting processes (either electrons or
ions transport) at low temperature. For instance, it is reported that
smaller particle size indeed improves low-temperature performance
in lithium half-cell, and characterization under full cell configuration
is required to fully optimize cell designs.8−10 As such, it
is imperative to understand power and energy fading mechanism at low
temperature. In general, the poor performance at low temperature is
attributed to various factors including increased viscosity and reduced
lithium ion mobility in nonaqueous electrolyte, increased charge-transfer
related resistance at the electrode and electrolyte interface, and
slow diffusion within active material particles. Abraham et al. studied
low-temperature behavior of binder and carbon-free cathode materials
including LiMn2O4 and LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 when coupled with LTO and
reported increase of impedance at low temperature mainly due to sluggish
processes at electrode and electrolyte interface where the lithium
ions move across the active material and electrolyte interface.11

It is well known that electrode structure
and relative concentration
of active materials and conductive additives have significant impacts
on cell performances because electrochemical reactions involve the
transport of lithium ions between the electrodes and the electrolyte,
and the transfer of electrons between the current collector and the
electrode active materials.12−14 In particular, most of titanium
oxides including LTO are electronic insulators with band gaps of around
3–4.0 eV because of the presence of Ti4+ where there
is no electron in 3d bands. Doping, carbon-coated on LTO surface or
nanostructured LTO allows improved rate capabilities.15−17 Interestingly, it is reported that LTO without any conductive additives
outperformed its counterpart, where the formation of highly conductive
mixed Ti4+/Ti3+ surface oxidation states at
the early state of charge (SOC) allows facile electron transport within
electrodes.14,18,19 This example illustrates the importance of electrode formulation
along with fundamental understanding of ionic and electronic distribution
during electrochemical reactions.

With these in mind, we report
herein the effects of physical properties
of LTO material (particle size and surface area) and the electronic
percolation network on low-temperature performance of LMO/LTO-based
cells. We find that LTO with small particle size, in other words,
high surface area is crucial to enable high power, while addition
of more carbon additive in electrode formulation has only marginal
improvement at low temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic
(EIS) results showed significant reduction in charge transfer-related
process with smaller LTO particles. This result reveals the importance
of charge transport considerations in the vicinity of electrode and
electrolyte interface when designing high performance LTO-based batteries.

2 Results and Discussion
Two different
types of commercially available LTO, namely LTO A
and LTO B, were used to investigate the effect of physical properties
on electrochemical performance. Capacities of LTO A and B are similar,
while surface area (4 vs 6.5 m2 g–1)
and D50, which means a cumulative 50%
point of diameter, (7.1 vs 1.3 μm), are different. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) of LTO A and LTO B, Figure 1a, confirms physical property of two LTOs.
It is worthwhile to note that LTO A is an agglomerate with 100–200
nm primary particles, while LTO B is not; a size of a primary particle
is smaller than D50 of LTO B. However,
primary particles not in contact with electrolyte are not regarded
as electrochemical active area; therefore, LTO B has more reaction
sites than LTO A. Single layer pouch cells with 18 mA h LMO/LTO were
fabricated, and voltage profiles of the cell (LMO/LTO A) were shown
in Figure 1c when cycled
between 2.7 and 2.0 V with C/10 current rate. Electrolyte is chosen
to be 1.2 M LiPF6 in ester and carbonate mixture that has
about three times higher conductivity (∼6 mS cm–1) than conventional carbonate-based electrolyte at −30 °C
to ensure that a change in physical properties such as viscosity of
liquid electrolyte is ruled out. Area specific resistance (ASR) was
calculated via hybrid pulse power capability (HPPC) to deconvolute
contribution of cathode and anode during pulsing at various SOCs;
a piece of lithium metal was inserted between two electrodes to record
the potential of each electrode during the test.20Figure 1d shows voltage response of LMO, LTO, and the cell during 10 C 2
s pulse at about 50% SOC at −30 °C. We found that the
contribution of LTO electrode is dominant during the HPPC test, and
the impedance is around 80% at wide temperature windows (−30
to 60 °C), as shown in Figure 1e. This result is of particular interest as contribution
of LTO was reported to be around 50% when coupled with NMC.21 As such, it stands to reason to optimize LTO
electrode to enhance power capability of LMO/LTO-based cell.

of the electrode made from LTO A and B, (c) voltage
profiles of the LMO/LTO cell, (d) voltage responses (cell, LMO, and
LTO) at −30 °C during 2 s and 10 C pulse, and (e) impedance
contribution of LMO and LTO at −30, 25, and 60 °C.

Cold crank performance of LMO/LTO A at −30
°C are shown
in Figure 2a at 50%
SOC. The cold crank test is composed of three pulses of ∼16
C for 0.5 s and ∼10.5 C for 4 s with 10 s of rest between pulses,
as the inset indicates. These repeated pulses were similar to 6 and
4 kW pulses at the battery level outlined by USABC. The end of voltages
at each pulse (V1, V2, and V3) represents power capability
of cells, and the higher the end of voltages suggests lower voltage
drop, that is, lower impedance. The cells need to maintain a minimum
specific potential to be characterized as “passing”
cold crank performance test outlined by USABC. Figure 2b,c shows the end of voltages at three pulses
with different LTO designs at −30 and 25 °C (Figure S1 contains voltage response as a function
of time).

Figure 2 (a) Cold crank response of the LMO/LTO A cell at −30 °C;
(inset) one pulse that consists of 0.5 s of scaled 6 kW (∼16
C) and 4 s of scaled 4 kW (∼10.5 C), (b) end of voltages after
each pulse of LMO/LTO A 3 wt % carbon black, LTO B 3 wt % carbon black,
and LTO A 5 wt % carbon black at −30 °C, and (c) at 25
°C.

It is clear that LTO B outperformed LTO A, and
voltage difference
during the first 16 C pulse ranges 0.25–0.5 V. The only difference
between LTO A and LTO B electrodes is the type of LTO; therefore,
enhanced cold crank performance can be attributed to smaller D50 and higher surface area of LTO B. This suggests
that shortening the ionic diffusion path is one of the reasons for
enhanced low-temperature performance, in particular, lower charge
transfer related impedance, which will be discussed further later.
To correlate the electronic percolation network with cold crank performance,
LTO A with two different carbon additive concentrations (3 and 5 wt
%) were prepared. Cold crank results, Figure 2b, showed no significant difference between
two samples elucidating that the additional electronic percolation
network does not improve rate capabilities at low temperature.

It is worthwhile to note that the trend does not hold at room temperature.
Both LTO B with 3% carbon additive and LTO A with 5% carbon additive
have less than 10 mV higher end of pulse voltages during three pulses
than baseline LTO A with 3% carbon additive, as seen Figure 2c. The fact that smaller particle
and more carbon additive have better pulse power capabilities points
out that both ionic and electronic play a role at room temperature,
while ionic transport becomes dominant at low temperature.

Three
LMO/LTO cells were characterized by EIS to understand the
underlying mechanism of ionic and electronic contribution at temperature
ranges of 25 to −30 °C. Figure 3a shows representative Nyquist spectra of
LMO/LTO A with a 3 wt % carbon additive cell between 100 kHz and 0.01
Hz with 5 mV voltage perturbation at 50% SOC. As expected, the spectrum
consists of a high frequency intersect, mid frequency (1kHz to 10
Hz) semicircle, and a low frequency (<1 Hz) Warburg tail corresponding
to electrolyte impedance and contact resistance, interfacial impedance
at the electrode–electrolyte interface, and diffusion processes
in the electrolyte and through the active materials particles, respectively.22,23 The EIS spectra were fitted by an equivalent circuit, as shown in Figure 3a.

Figure 3 (a) Representative Nyquist
plot of the LMO/LTO cell (inset: equivalent
circuit for fitting), (b) Nyquist plot of LMO/LTO A 3 wt % carbon
black at 25, 0, and −30 °C, (c) Arrhenius plot of Rct of samples, and (d) relative Rct ratio of LTO A and LTO B (purple), 3 wt % carbon black
and 5 wt % carbon black (green).

The significant increases (0.256–28.95 Ω)
in the midfrequency
arc upon decreasing the temperature from 25 to −30 °C,
indicating an impedance increase at the electrode and electrolyte
interface, as seen Figure 3b. Increases in high frequency intercept are relatively small
(0.087–0.22 Ω); therefore, contribution of Ohmic impedance
is negligible compared to interfacial processes.

Nyquist plots
of LMO/LTO A with 3 wt %, LMO/LTO B with 3 wt %,
and LMO/LTO A with 5 wt % at 25, 0, and −30 °C are shown
in Figure S2. Intercept at x axis of the spectra is adjusted to zero for easy comparison; resistance
from bulk electrolyte and ionic resistance in pores from the porous
electrode model are the same because thickness of the separator and
the electrode porosity/electrode will be similar between samples.24 All of the samples behave similarly; increases
in the midfrequency arc is clear, and the size of midfrequency arc
decreases with electronic percolation (LTO A 5 wt % carbon additive)
and smaller particle size (LTO B 3 wt % carbon additive). Figure 3c shows the Arrhenius
plot of charge transfer-related impedance (Rct) and log of Rct with inverse
of absolute temperature, which is linear for all samples, suggesting
a thermally activated process. Activation energy values of three cells
range around 0.42–0.52 eV. In particular, LTO A with 3 and
5 wt % carbon additive have almost the same activation energy, so
it appears that electronic percolation decreases impedance values
but does not change the nature of interfacial processes in the vicinity
of electrode and electrolyte. It is interesting to see that activation
energy of LMO/LTO B is lower than LMO/LTO A, and we speculate that
ionic contribution becomes smaller with small particle size of LTO
B. For all our electrodes, the midfrequency arc arises from interfacial
phenomena of electron-transfer kinetics and the transport of ionic
species by diffusion or migration across the electrode and electrolyte
interface, and it is generally accepted that electronic conduction
has lower activation energy than ionic transport in many systems,
which might explain lower activation energy with LTO B cells.25 Works are underway to decouple electronic and
ionic contribution within cells by building carbon-free electrodes
or carbon, binder-free pellet type or thin-film electrodes, as reported
before.11,14

Relative ratio of charge transfer
impedance is shown in Figure 3d; the ratio of LTO
B/LTO A is sensitive to temperature, and it decreases from 0.66 to
0.28 as temperature gets lower because ionic transport becomes sluggish.
The ratio of 5 wt % carbon additive/3 wt % carbon additive, on the
other hand, is less sensitive to temperature indicating electron transport
through carbon additive is not as critical, which confirms the cold
crank results shown in Figure 2b.

It is evident from our data that rational design
of LMO/LTO-based
chemistry for low-temperature applications is to optimize the LTO
electrode. Changing the amount of conductive carbon in the electrodes
is not likely to improve charge transfer processes with lowering temperature,
rather enhancing ionic transport is critical to meet low-temperature
requirements of various applications by increasing the electrochemical
active area of the active material. With optimized LTO design (D50: 1 μm BET: 8 m2 g–1), a voltage of 1.5 A h LMO/LTO pouch cell is well above Vmin (8 V for battery module, 1.6 V/cell with
5S configuration) during all three cold crank pulses at −30
°C after removing scaled 360 W h (∼40% SOC), as shown
in Figure 4. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration
of LMO/LTO-based chemistry that passes the cold crank performance
test outlined by USABC at relatively low SOC, while state-of-the-art
lead acid batteries and graphite-based batteries cannot meet stringent
requirements.

the optimized
cell after removing scaled 360 kW h at −30 °C from a 1.5
A h pouch cell.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we investigated
the effect of particle size and
electronic percolation on low-temperature power capabilities for LTO-based
lithium-ion batteries. For an electrode with same carbon additive
contents, LTO with smaller particle size has faster ionic transport,
while increasing the electronic percolation network has minimal impact
on low-temperature performance. We conclude that ionic transport between
electrolyte and active materials and/or within the particles controls
the rate at low temperature. Our work shows that understanding ionic
and electronic contribution can guide the rational design and fabrication
of electrode architectures for low temperature.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Electrodes
LiMn2O4 (LMO) and Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) were purchased from Posco ESM. Cathode electrode consists
of LMO, carbon additive, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) binder
in a weight ratio of 91.3:4.2:4.5 on a 15 μm thick Al current
collector. The negative electrode consists of LTO, carbon additive,
and PVdF in a weight ratio of 94:3:3 and 92:5:3 on a 15 μm thick
Al current collector for 3 and 5 wt % carbon black samples respectively.
Each electrode laminate were prepared by mixing a slurry of the oxide,
carbon black, and PVdF in N-methyl pyrrolidone with the desired mass ratio.

4.2 Cell Assembly
Single layer pouch
cells composed of LMO and LTO electrodes with n/p ratio below 1 were
used, where n/p below 1 is known to have better cycle life.26 Detailed electrode dimensions and cell are shown Figure S3. Loading of LMO is 7 mg/cm2. Two electrodes were separated by polypropylene separator. 1.2 M
LiPF6 solution in ester and carbonate mixture (ester >70%
of volume) was used as the electrolyte to improve low-temperature
conductivity.

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
Charge–discharge
measurements were recorded on Arbin system at controlled temperature
of either 25 °C under conditions described in the text. The rate
was defined as C/n, where C corresponded to the theoretical cell capacity; n was defined as the full discharge time (in hours). ASR
is calculated by (Vpulse start – Vpulse end)/(Ipulse start – Ipulse end) for HPPC experiment.
Cold crank tests of 18 mA h single layer pouch cells were performed
at −30 °C by applying 16 C for 0.5 s and 10.5 C for 4
s three times; there is 10 s rest between pulses. Cells were charged
to 100% SOC at 25 °C prior to cold crank, and the test was done
at every 10% SOCs. Cold crank of 1.5 A h multilayer pouch cells were
tested by the following USABC procedure, where three 0.5 s of 6 kW
and 4 s of 4 kW pulses after removing scaled 360 W h energy, which
corresponds to ∼40% SOC. EIS spectra were acquired on a Gamry
at 50% SOC between 100 kHz and 20 mHz at 25, 0, and −30 °C.
