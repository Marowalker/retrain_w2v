Unique
morphologies were found in binary and ternary polymer blended
particles, including Ashura-type phase separation, which has three
different polymer components on the particle surface. The morphologies
of phase-separated structures in the binary polymer blended particles
are discussed in terms of the surface tensions of the blended polymers.
Structural control of ternary polymer blended particles was achieved
based on the combination of polymers by examining binary polymer blended
particles. A theoretical approach based on the Cahn–Hilliard
equations gives identical morphologies with the experimental results.
This work opens the way to creating polymer particles with sophisticated
nanostructures by controlling their morphologies as predicted by theoretical
simulations.

Introduction
Nanostructured polymer
particles have received considerable attention
because of their potential for use in applications for novel photonic
materials,1 pigments for electric papers,2 drug carriers for delivery systems,3 probes for immunoassay systems,4 and others.5,6 For these polymer particles to
be suitable for these applications, control over the fine structures
of the particles is a central issue. Several techniques have been
developed to prepare nanostructured polymer particles. For example,
a microfluidic device, which can produce monomers or cross-linkable
polymer droplets, is a powerful tool for producing multiphase particles
whose sizes are normally over tens of micrometer scale.7 Nisisako et al. have reported that Janus-type
polymer particles can be formed from a binary mixture of monomer droplets
containing different pigments by using a top-down microfluidic device
and applied them to electric paper pigments.8 Multiple-phase particles can also be prepared from a multiple set
of laminar flows in a microfluidic device.9 However, using these top-down approaches, it is difficult to fabricate
particles of less than micrometer size, required for many of the applications
of nanostructured polymer particles mentioned above.

To produce
particles of size less than the micrometer scale, emulsion-based
bottom-up approaches have been employed to encapsulate polymer blends
in small submicron-sized confined spaces. As an example, mini-emulsion
formation from binary polymer blends followed by solvent evaporation
has been employed to prepare polymer blended particles. Landfestor
and co-workers reported the formation of particles composed of donor–accepter-type
π-conjugated polymer blended particles.10 Okubo and co-workers have also presented polymer blended particles
from various homopolymers.11,12

We have developed
a simple method for fabricating polymer blended
particles by a simple mixing of a poor solvent into a solution of
polymer blends followed by evaporation of a good solvent.13 Using this self-organized precipitation (SORP)
process, various kinds of binary polymer blended particles have been
prepared. Based on these prepared particles, we have found that binary
polymer blended systems can be classified into two kinds of morphologies:
Janus and core–shell.14 Janus-type
particles typically have two different surfaces. They consist of two
different polymer phases separated in a single particle, forming two
respective hemispheres.15 In the core–shell
particle type, one polymer covers the whole surface of the other polymer.16 Using the SORP method, when the polymers in
the blend have similar hydrophobicities, Janus-type phase-separated
structures are formed when water was used as the poor solvent. In
contrast, the core–shell type phase separation was observed
when the hydrophobicity of the polymers was very different. Thus,
the structural variety of binary polymer blends is limited to only
these two phases, though there are some intermediate structures, such
as an engulfment type. Changing the fraction of the polymer produces
changes in the volume fraction of the polymer. However, Janus or core–shell
morphologies remain unchanged.15 Some other
examples of Janus,31 composite Janus,32 core–shell,33 and virus-like morphologies34 have been
examined.

In order to introduce structural variety for polymer
blended particles,
increasing the number of polymers in the blend can realize multiphase
particles. In this report, we examined studies of binary polymer blended
systems prepared by the SORP method to determine the morphologies
of the structures produced from the blended polymers. We then investigated
structural control of ternary blended particles based on the relationship
between the phase-separated structures and the combination of polymers
in the binary systems. We found new types of phase-separated polymer
blended particles including the “Ashura” type, which
has three different polymer components on the surface, named after
the Asian god who has three faces. Experimental characterization of
such ternary blended polymers has been achieved using state-of-the-art
electron tomography (ET), and a numerical simulation based on the
coupled Cahn–Hilliard equation was conducted. We discuss the
phase behaviors of ternary polymer blended particles in terms of the
relationships of the boundary conditions between the polymers and
solvents.

Results and Discussion
Binary and ternary polymer blended
particles are prepared by SORP.13 The same
amounts of tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution
of different polymers were mixed and then the same amount of water
was mixed into the solution. After evaporation of THF, polymer blended
particles precipitated in water. The information and chemical structures
of polymers used are listed in Table 1 and Scheme 1, respectively. Typically, submicron- to micron-sized polymer
particles were prepared (see Supporting Information S1).

Before preparing the ternary blend particles, the
relationship
between the phase-separated structures and the combination of polymers
was examined based on the binary systems (Figure 1). In order to visualize the internal structures
of binary polymer blended particles, stainable polymers with OsO4 (e.g., PI) or polymers having high electron density [e.g.,
poly(ferrocenyl dimethylsilane) (PFeS)] were used as the first polymer,
and lower electron density polymers were used as the other polymer.
In Figure 1, the polymers
are ordered based on their surface tensions, which were estimated
from measurements of the water and diiodemethane contact angles on
the respective polymer films (Supporting Information S2). The structures were classified into three typical types:
Janus (red), core–shell (stained core) (blue), and core–shell
(stained shell) (green).

Figure 1 TEM images of obtained binary polymer blended
particles. PI, PB-NH2-37k, and PB-NH2-14k were
stained with OsO4. PFeS and stained moieties are shown
as dark contrasts. The
particle morphologies were classified as Janus (red), core–shell
(stained core) (blue), and core–shell (stained shell) (green).
The surface tensions of the polymers are shown under the names of
the polymers. The scale bar indicates 500 nm.

The combinations of hydrophobic polymers, which have low
surface
tensions, typically form the Janus structure (Figure 1a–c,f–h,k,l). Binary polymer
blends comprised a combination of low and high surface tension polymers
show the core–shell morphology. When the stainable polymer
has low surface tension, the unstained polymer forms the shell to
stabilize the interface between the polymer and the dispersion media,
water in this case (Figure 1d,e,i,m). In contrast, when the stainable polymer has a high
surface tension, stained shells were formed (Figure 1o). These results are identical to those
in the previous literature. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the Janus
structure was formed from both hydrophilic combinations (Figure 1r,s). There are some
exceptions (Figure 1,j,n,p,r), however, these results strongly imply that the surface
tension of polymers is a key issue for controlling the interior structures
of binary polymer blended particles. There are some odd structures
found. For example, Figure 1j,n should be core–shell-type phase separation based
on the relationships among these polymer combinations, but actually,
Janus-type particles were formed. There are some reports about formation
of spherical particles that comprised amphiphilic end-functionalized
polymer blends.31 In those cases, polymers
were precipitated in O/W emulsion followed by solvent evaporation,
thus, hydrophilic end groups strongly interact with one another, and
the polymers behave more hydrophobic than the original amphiphilic
polymers. As seen in the previous reports, both of amphiphilic polymers
which have hydrophilic moieties behave as hydrophobic polymers, and
the difference of interfacial tensions between two polymers depressed,
and as a result, they form Janus-type phase separation.

To investigate
possible improvements on morphological controllability,
ternary polymer blended systems, consisting of three different polymers,
were examined. To study the control of the structure of the ternary
system, the interactions among the three different polymers need to
be taken into account. First, PS, PI, and PFeS, which have low surface
tensions, were used to form ternary blended particles. In the experimental
results of the binary polymer blended system shown in Figure 1, PS/PI, PI/PFeS, and PS/PFeS
all form Janus-type phase separation structures, indicating that these
three polymers have almost the same interfacial interactions with
each other and with water as the dispersion medium. Figure 2a shows a transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image of PS/PI/PFeS ternary blended particles. The
image shows that spherical particles were formed and three fan-type
domains with different contrasts were clearly imaged inside the particles.
Because the contrast of TEM indicates the electron density of the
materials, the morphologies and location of the polymers can be distinguished
by the difference in the image contrast. The PI moieties that were
stained with a heavy metal Os showed the darkest contrast. Because
of the high electron density of iron atoms in ferrocene moieties,
PFeS also showed a dark contrast, though less than that of the PI
phase. PS moieties have low electron density and showed a bright contrast.
Therefore, the image indicates that the respective polymers form identical
fan-type domains inside the particles. Figure 2b,c shows an ET image and a cross-sectional
ET image of the particle, respectively. The PS, PI, and PFeS domains
are indicated by red, orange, and green, respectively. Three different
domains fill the particle and the particle has surfaces that comprise
three different polymer materials. We named these kinds of particles
having three different faces “Ashura”, which is the
name of an Asian god who has three different faces.

Figure 2 TEM (a), ET (b), and
cross-sectional ET (c) images of particles
comprised of PS/PI/PFeS, respectively.

In contrast to the case of the PS/PI/PFeS blend, a core–shell-type
phase separated structure should be formed of a combination of low
surface tension polymers (e.g., PI, PtBA) and high surface tension
polymers [e.g., poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), PSNH2] based on the results for binary blended systems. Figure 3a shows a TEM image of PI/PtBA/PSNH2 blend particles. Spherical particles were formed and a core–shell
structure was clearly imaged. Surprisingly, for ternary polymer blends,
two phases co-exist in the core phase. Because PI/PSNH2 and PtBA/PSNH2 particles form a core–shell-type
phase separation and PI/PtBA forms a Janus-type phase separation in
binary blended particles, it is found that dark contrast PI and bright
contrast PtBA form the core and gray PSNH2 forms the shells.
In the core, the PI and PtBA phases form a Janus-type phase separation,
as for the binary blended case. Figure 3b,c shows an ET and a cross-sectional ET image of a
PI/PtBA/PSNH2 particle. The PSNH2 phase completely
encapsulates the PI and PtBA phases, which form a binary Janus-type
phase separation structure in the core. These results for ternary
blended polymer particles indicate that the internal phase separated
structures of ternary blended polymers in a three-dimensionally confined
space can be controlled based on the surface tension of the polymers.
(See also Supporting Information S4).

Simulation of three-dimensional (3D) confinement
of nanoparticles
is a topic of great interest, as it allows the exploration of a variety
of settings.19−25 In previous studies of the 3D confinement of diblock copolymer particles,
we developed a model of phase separation in a particle based on the
coupled Cahn–Hilliard equations.26 This model is a powerful tool for simulating and estimating phase
separation morphologies of diblock copolymers in 3D confined systems.
There are some differences between the diblock copolymer and polymer
blend cases. For example, the interaction between the polymers in
polymer blends is weaker than those in diblock copolymers because
there are no chemical bonds between these polymers. Furthermore, because
we examined ternary blended systems in our experiment, the interactions
between the three different phases and the dispersion media had to
be taken into account. Therefore, we developed a new model for ternary
blended polymer particles based on the coupled Cahn–Hilliard
equations.

Here, we summarize the theoretical model for simulating
confined
Ashura and Janus core–shell particles. A similar model for
the mixture of two systems has been previously described in refs.25−27 To describe the particles under study, we need four components,
namely, a confinement surface to keep the particle located in a section
of the spatial domain and three inner components within the surface.
The first component is described by an order parameter u. This order
parameter has a value within the interval [−1,1], where the
end points of the interval correspond to solvent-rich domain (−1)
and a polymer-rich domain (+1). The boundary between the solvent-
and polymer-rich domains defines the boundary of the particle. The
remaining components are described by order parameters v, w, and z, which define the state
of a polymer (nonrich and rich) with values in the interval [−1,1]
with the end points corresponding to the rich and nonrich phases,
respectively.

When the four order parameters above interact,
a macrophase separation
described by u generates a region in which a confined particle can
be located and surrounded by the solvent. Then, three microphase separations
take place inside the separated domain. Here, we consider microphase
separations of two kinds, namely, Ashura and Janus core–shell.

The main difference between Ashura and Janus core–shell
particles is in the way their constitutive components interact with
one another. In the Ashura case, all the components interact in the
same way, whereas the components of the Janus core exhibit an opposite
interaction from the component representing the shell.

The dynamics
of the state of the four equations evolves to minimize
the value of the energy functional in the following expression28−30 1  where 2  

The plus
and minus signs for the vw and vz terms of eq 2 apply
for Janus core–shell and Ashura, respectively. bi < 0 for i = 1,
2, 3, 4 and 5.

We can write the dynamical equations as 3   4   5   6  

After computing
the derivatives of eqs 3–6, the gradient
system of the equations corresponding to the energy functional is
the following set of four coupled Cahn–Hilliard equations as
follows 7   8   9   10  

In eq 1, Ω
is
a smooth bounded domain in . Here, we focus on three-dimensional confinement
and thus N = 3. Parameters ϵu, ϵv, ϵw and ϵz are proportional
to the thickness of the propagating fronts of each component. These
parameters control the size of the interface of the order parameters u, v, w, and z, respectively. The multidimensional double-well potential in eq 2 represents two different
possible states in phase transition, −1 or +1. This function
has four dimensions and the coupling parameters b1, b2, b3, b4 and b5.

Coupling parameter b1 controls
the
affinity of the surrounding medium represented by order parameter u and each of the components of the particle in such a way
that as the magnitude of b1 increases,
the preference of u for the components v, w, and z also increases accordingly.
For simplicity, we assume that the constitutive components of the
particle (Ashura or Janus core–shell) interact with the solvent
with equal intensity. Parameter b2 is
a confinement parameter. The term in eq 2 associated to b2 lowers
the energy when u > 0 (polymer rich). Intuitively,
this parameter helps to confine the particle to a polymer-rich region
and to keep it separated from the solvent. Parameter b3 can be related to the surface tension between the components
of the particle. In the case of Ashura, all the three pairs of components,
(v, w), (w, z), and (v, z), have a
similar value of surface tension, thus, they form flat interfaces
of approximately equal size. The case for Janus core–shell
particles is different. In Janus core–shell particles, the
shell and the core have considerably large interfacial tension, which
explains the spherical interface between the shell and core. In contrast,
the components in the Janus core have a small interfacial tension
between them, and therefore, these components form a small flat interface.
To account for the difference of interfacial tensions between components
in Ashura particles and between shell and core components in the Janus
core–shell particles, we employ opposite signs in terms of eq 2 associated to b3. Parameter b4 is
related to the triple juncture between components v, w, and z. Parameter b5 is a secondary confinement parameter that is zero for
the Ashura particle. In the case of the Janus core–shell particle,
the term in eq 2 associated
to b5 lowers the energy when v > 0. Intuitively, this parameter helps to confine the Janus core
to a region localized under a shell defined by v >
0. Notice that while parameter b2 <
0 promotes microphase separation when u > 0, parameter b5 < 0 promotes microphase separations when v > 0. Parameters τu,
τv, τw and τz are time constants
to control the speed at which order parameter u, v, w, and z move.

Equations 7–10 constitute a mixture of the four coexisting order
parameters u, v, w, and z. The first equation, featuring the shape
variable, separates a confined particle from the surrounding external
medium. The other three equations represent the inner components of
the nanoparticle. This proposed approach allows us to describe a particle
by integrating a set of equations for the whole system, thus avoiding
the explicit treatment of the boundary conditions at each interface.

Figures 4 and 5 show numerical results for Ashura and Janus core–shell
particles in three dimensions. The Ashura particle seems to be energetically
stable. With regard to Janus core–shell particles, although
these morphologies are observable in experiments, our simulation results
suggest that they appear to be transient in the framework of our theoretical
model. Specifically, Janus core–shell particles in three dimensions
undergo barely noticeable changes in energy over a long time period.
However, in two dimensions, these particles sustain a configuration
that is comparable in shape to the experimental findings during a
time period and the stability of this morphology can be maintained
to some extent by thermal annealing.

and time discretized intervals, Δx and Δt, are set to 0.02 and 4 × 10–5,
respectvely. All units are dimensionless.

= 2.03, Δx = 0.02, and Δt = 2 × 10–5. All units are dimensionless.

Supporting Information S3 shows differences
of interfacial tensions between pairs of polymers. The interfacial
tension is a measure of the energy content at the interface of the
polymers. In the case of the Ashura particle, the constitutive components
have low values of interfacial tension, 0.26, 0.714, and 1.15 (Table S3); therefore, it is expected to have
small interfaces in this case. This explains the flat interfaces of
the polymers in the Ashura particle. For the Janus core–shell
particle, the components at the core (Janus) have a small value of
interfacial tension (0.377), which again is related to the flat interface
of the components at the core of the particle. However, the shell
and the core have quite a large interfacial tension (23.1 and 26.3).
This large energy content at the interface explains the large size
of such interface between the shell and the core, which completely
engulfs the core. As for the model, the b3 term in the potential for the Ashura particle is −vw – vz – wz. Each factor in this term has the same low intensity of the interfacial
tension (this just for simplicity). On the other hand, the b3 term for the case of the Janus core shell
is vw + vz – wz. The intensity of this term at the core (−wz) is much smaller than the interactions between the core and the
shell (vw and vz).

Conclusions
The experimental and simulation results are identical, showing
that the model correctly simulates the experimental results. Actually,
we have experimentally examined rational 21 combinations (19 for binary
and 2 for ternary) of polymers to reveal the effect of interfacial
tensions on phase-separated structures in the polymer blended particles,
and these data have been summarized in three figures. To ensure the
reproducibility of the structures found, we performed and analyzed
a large number of experiments and more than 200 TEM images were studied.
In this work, we report the Ashura-type particle in the ternary blended
system, which to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously
shown. These results also suggest that ternary blended polymer particles
exhibit new types of morphologies and the combination of the polymers
gives rise to a variety of morphologies. The ternary blended system
provides a simple way to fabricate particles possessing sophisticated
morphologies that can be applied to a wide variety of practical applications.

Experimental
Methods
Materials
Polystyrene (PS, Mw = 280k) and cis-type polyisoprene (PI, Mw = 35k) were purchased from Aldrich. Poly(tert-butylacrylate)
(PtBA, Mn = 15k), PFeS (Mn = 11k), PMMA (Mn = 123k),
poly(1,2-butadiene) amino-terminated polystyrene (PBNH2, Mn = 14k, 37k), and amine-terminated
polystyrene (PSNH2, Mn = 25k)
were purchased from Polymer Source Inc. THF was purchased from FUJIFILM
Wako Pure Chemical.

Preparation of Binary Polymer Blended Particles
The
polymer blended particles were prepared according to the literature.
Each polymer was dissolved in THF to prepare a 0.1 mg/mL solution.
Two polymer solutions (0.5 mL) were mixed, and then, 1 mL water was
added to the solution with a speed of 1 mL/min. THF was evaporated
from the mixed solution in a glass bottle immersed in a water bath
at 40 °C for 12 h. The solution became gradually turbid with
evaporation of THF and finally, aqueous dispersions of binary polymer
blended particles were obtained. PI- or PBNH2- containing
particles were treated with 0.2% OsO4 aq. for 2 h to stain
the polymer and to form cross-linked double bonds of PI and PB moieties.
After staining, the particles were corrected by ultracentrifugation
(12 000 rpm, 15 min) and washed with pure water three times.

Preparation of Ternary Polymer Blended Particles
The
ternary polymer blended particles were prepared in the same way as
the binary polymer blends. Three different polymer solutions (0.33
mL) were mixed and then 1 mL of water was added to the solution. Other
procedures were also the same as for binary polymer blends.

STEM Observations
Cu grids with an elastic carbon membrane
were hydrophilized with UV–O3 treatment for 5 min.
One drop of an aqueous dispersion of particles was dropped onto a
grid surface and dried at room temperature. The structure of the particles
was observed using a scanning electron microscope (S-5200, Hitachi,
Japan) equipped with a scanning TEM (STEM) unit.

ET Observations
Cu grids were prepared as for STEM
observations. The samples were observed by using a transmission electron
microscope (H-7650, Hitachi, Japan) with varying tilt angles from
−60° to 60° with a step of 1° (120 images were
obtained). The obtained images were stacked using the imaging software
ImageJ (ver. 1.48v, NIH, United States), and then, tilting axis alignment
and reconstruction of xy sliced images were performed
using a plug-in for ImageJ, TomoJ (freely provided by Centre Universitaire
d’Orsay, France).17 The generation
of 3D reconstruction images and abstraction of outlines were performed
using HawkC, which was freely provided by Osaka University, Japan.18 Cross-sectional images and reconstruction of
the 3D images were generated using CINEMA 4D (MAXON Computer, GmbH,
Germany).

Theoretical Simulation and Numerical Details
To integrate eqs 7–10, we implemented a semi-implicit scheme using appropriate
parameters in Figures 4 and 5. We initiated the simulation from suitable
initial conditions for each component. The numerical solution of the
coupled system of equations guarantees the production of morphologies
of minimum free energy for a sufficiently long simulation time. Likewise,
the solution of the Cahn–Hilliard equations ensures that the
total volume 11  remains constant, where u0 is the initial distribution of the component u in
the whole domain. We selected appropriate values for
the parameters of the model and solved the dynamical equations in
three dimensions. For a simulation cell in three dimensions, we use
a cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions in the X-, Y-, and Z-axes of the lattice
box. To represent three-dimensional morphologies, we plotted isosurfaces
taken at appropriate values of v, w, and z.
