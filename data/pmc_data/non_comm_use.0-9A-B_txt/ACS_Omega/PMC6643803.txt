Dehydration
of binary methyl acetate–water mixtures under
neutral, acidic, and basic conditions was carried out by using PERVAP
composite membranes based on polyvinyl alcohol and poly(1-vinylpyrrolidone-co-2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) P(VP-co-DMAEMA). The effects of an acid (HCl) and a base (NaOH) on the separation
performance of the membrane during the pervaporation process were
investigated. The pH-responsive nature of membranes has been confirmed
by swelling tests and analysis of the chemical structure of polymeric
membranes. In addition, a mechanism of ring-opening of VP units is
proposed and correlated to the changes of membrane separation performance.

==== Body
Introduction
In the last decades, great attention has
been dedicated to developing
and scaling up novel and advanced membrane materials.1,2 However, only few polymers are used to produce membranes at large
scale.3,4 Lack of understanding of material properties
and its correlation with membrane behavior under real operating conditions
are usually the reasons for failing.

One of those novel materials
are the so-called stimuli-responsive
polymers. Such polymers as membranes are also known as intelligent
or smart membranes2,5 as they allow intelligent control
of separation when the environment changes. Because they exhibit trigger
behavior predictably to pH,6 temperature,7 different fields,8 or ionic strength,9 new applications
can be developed based on these polymeric membranes. In fact, by introducing
pH-responsive groups and controlling ionic strength, the membranes
were able to release drugs,10 improve the
separation performance in water treatment11 and perform as chemical sensor and flow regulator.12

The commonly available pH-responsive functional polymers
are weak
polyelectrolytes with carboxyl, pyridine, or amino groups.13−15 The presence of acidic groups in polymers (e.g. carboxyl groups,
pyridine) at low pH induces the intermolecular hydrogen bonding formation,
thus leading to shrinkage of the polymer chains. While at high pH,
carboxyl groups dissociate into carboxylate ions, resulting in a high
charge density, which trigger the swelling of the polymer. Polymers
containing basic groups (e.g. amino groups) show opposite behavior
compared to polyacids. At low pH, the amino group is protonated, and
the material exhibits hydrophilic character and at high pH, hydrophobic
properties are pronounced. As a result of protonation/deprotonation,
swelling properties of these polymeric materials are changed.2

A typical polymer containing amino groups
used to prepare stimuli-responsive
membranes is poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) P(DMAEMA).
The interesting feature of this polymer and derivatives (copolymers)
is their pH- and temperature-responsive nature.16 These polymers were used as graft material in the membrane
and as a blend with other polymers to obtain dual stimuli-responsive
properties.17,18 P(DMAEMA) was also used as membrane
material for gas separation,19−22 nanofiltration,23 and
microfiltration.18,24 In addition, P(DMAEMA) copolymers
were synthesized and investigated as micelles for drug delivery.13,25,26 Despite the overall high number
of references discussing pervaporation membranes,27 up to date there are only few works about pH-triggered
membranes for pervaporation and their behavior under variable and
industrial separation conditions.28−30

In the present
work, pervaporation membranes based on poly(1-vinylpyrrolidone-co-2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) P(VP-co-DMAEMA) with pH-trigger behavior are investigated. These membranes
are the commercial PERVAP membranes for alcohol removal from other
solvents. Although these membranes are already applied for dehydration
of various solvents and methanol removal from neutral mixtures,31,32 the feature as pH-responsive pervaporation membrane in acidic and
basic mixtures has not been reported yet. In the industry, during
the dehydration processes and methanol removal from other solvents,
many mixtures have acidic and/or basic nature, depending on impurities
present in the streams. Thus, understanding the membrane behavior
under triggered conditions is extremely important for the membrane
process and scale up. In addition, the new insight into these membranes
might extend their use to other applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
For the pervaporation tests, commercial pervaporation
membranes PERVAP 4155-30 and PERVAP 4155-70 from DeltaMem AG, Switzerland
were used.33 For the dense film preparation,
the P(VP-co-DMAEMA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were
supplied by DeltaMem AG. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with average molecular
weight of around 55 kDa, methyl acetate (MeAc, 99%) and sodium hydroxide
(NaOH, 90%, flakes) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. P(DMAEMA) with
a molecular weight of 98 kDa and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%) were
obtained from Polymer Source Inc. and VWR, respectively. Deuterated
chloroform (CDCl3, D 99.8%) with 0.05 v/v % TMS was obtained
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Distilled water was used for
the experiments, unless stated otherwise.

Polymer Dense Film Preparation
For copolymer characterization,
freestanding dense films from P(VP-co-DMAEMA) were
prepared in Teflon molds by solution casting (5.0 wt % aqueous solutions).
The drying of the films was performed in two steps: first the solvent
was slowly evaporated (two days) under atmospheric pressure at room
temperature, and then, the drying is completed at 40 °C under
vacuum (400 mbar) for one day. For the membrane characterization,
free-standing dense films from PVA and P(VP-co-DMAEMA)
were obtained by casting on Teflon sheets. Polymer solutions with
the same composition as the commercial composite membranes (PERVAP
4155-30 and 4155-70) were used. The wet film thickness was adjusted
with a knife blade to 500 μm. The procedure of drying and crosslinking
is described elsewhere.34

Pervaporation
Experiments
The pervaporation tests are
performed with binary MeAc/water mixtures, neutral and containing
2 mmol/L of HCl and 2 mmol/L of NaOH, respectively. The setup includes
two pervaporation cells, which allows testing simultaneously two different
types of membranes. The effective membrane area in each cell is 38
cm2. The mixture is filled into a feed tank and recirculated
by a pump with a feed flow parallel to the membrane surface. The feed
goes to the membrane cells, and then, the product from the cells is
returned to the feed tank as retentate. A heating system maintains
constant the feed/retentate temperature at 85 °C. In the permeate
side, a vacuum of 10 mbar is maintained by a vacuum pump. Permeate
samples are collected in a cold trap with dry ice and ethanol mixture.
For each measurement point, the amount of permeate, time, as well
as the feed/retentate samples are collected.

Instrumental Methods
The chemical structure of the
(co)polymer systems was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(NMR). NMR spectra were obtained at room temperature by using a Bruker
Ascend 500 spectrometer operated at 500 MHz for 1H nucleus.
Deuterated CDCl3 was used as the solvent with a sample
temperature of 298 K. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm,
and chemical shifts are referenced with respect to residual solvent
peaks and quoted with respect to TMS (δ 0.00). The collected
spectra were analyzed using MestReNova (v12.0) (Mestrelab Research
S.L).

Background corrected attenuated total reflection–Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR–FTIR) spectra were recorded
on a Bruker spectrophotometer in the range of 4000–400 cm–1, using 128 scans at a nominal resolution of 4 cm–1 using a diamond single reflection ATR. Atmospheric
compensation and offset correction were applied on the collected spectra
with the use of OPUS spectroscopy software (v7.0) (Bruker Optics).

The membrane swelling measurements were performed on free-standing
dense films prepared in the laboratory. The solvent uptake ratios
of the dense film were determined gravimetrically in water and MeAc/water
mixtures, under neutral, acidic, and basic conditions, respectively.
Dried films were used and placed in the selected solvent mixture at
room temperature and then left to swell until constant weight. The
samples were removed from the mixture between times, wiped with a
filter paper and weighed, and placed back into the mixture until the
equilibrium swelling ratios is obtained. Three parallel measurements
were carried out for each sample and average values as well as standard
deviation were calculated.

The wetting properties of membranes
were investigated with static
contact angle (CA) measurements performed with a CA goniometer, CAM
100 (LOT quantum design) based on a CDD camera with 50 mm optics.
Droplets of ultrapure water were placed on the membrane substrates
with a micro syringe, and the CA was automatically recorded and analyzed
by the instrument software by fitting the curve with the Young–Laplace
equation. The drop volume was kept constant for all measurements,
each sample was measured 6 times, and average values as well as standard
deviation were calculated.

During pervaporation tests, the water
concentration in the feed/retentate
samples was determined by coulometer Karl Fischer titration (737 KF
Coulometer, Metrohm). The compositions of permeates were measured
by using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatography equipped with a thermal
conductivity detector and HP-PLOT Q column.

The scanning electron
microscope (SEM) images of the membranes
were processed and analyzed using a Hitachi S-4800 SEM (Hitachi High-Technologies
Corporation, Japan) with a cold field-emission electron source. Electrically
conducting surfaces were achieved by sputtering the surface with gold
layer of 5 nm thickness.

Results and Discussion
According
to DeltaMem AG, the two tested membranes are fabricated
from PVA and P(VP-co-DMAEMA).34 The copolymer content in PERVAP 4155-30 and PERVAP 4155-70
is 70 and 30 wt %, respectively. NMR and ATR–FTIR were performed
to verify the molecular structure of used P(VP-co-DMAEMA). Homopolymers of PVP and P(DMAEMA) were also analyzed to
correlate with the copolymer.

Figure 1 displays
the 1H NMR spectra, where the observed peaks fit to the
expected chemical structure of the copolymers. The peaks also agree
with those reported in the literature for similar copolymers.35 The characteristic peaks of the copolymer backbone
related to the VP units appeared between 1.3 and 1.78 ppm, and between
3.00 and 3.40 ppm. Peaks from 1.80 to 2.50 ppm and between 3.00 and
3.40 ppm are assigned with the protons of the heterocyclic ring in
the VP units. The signals of the DMAEMA units in the copolymer structure
appear in the region of 1.05 to 1.23 ppm and 1.80 to 2.10 ppm, corresponding
to the methyl and methylene protons in the backbone. The methyl protons
of the DMAEMA units appear at around 2.30 ppm, and the characteristic
peaks around 2.56 and 4.08 ppm are assigned with the methylene groups
in the DMAEMA units.

polymers (P(DMAEMA) and PVP) and the P(VP-co-DMAEMA)
copolymer (solvent: CDCl3, temperature: RT, number of transients
(nt): 256 and relaxation time (d1): 1.5).

The ATR–FTIR spectra of both homopolymers and P(VP-co-DMAEMA) copolymer, depicted in Figure 2, were found to be consistent with the corresponding
macromolecular structures.35,36 The absorption bands
at 1465 and 1425 cm–1 are characteristic absorptions
of the pyrrolidinyl group, and the bands at 1654 and 1024 cm–1 are attributed to the carbonyl group as well as the C–N stretching
vibrations in PVP. The characteristic absorption bands of P(DMAEMA)
homopolymer can be assigned to the C=O stretching vibration
at 1730 cm–1, (C–H(−N(CH3)2)) stretching vibrations between 2770–2940 cm–1 as well as the N(CH3)2 deformational
stretching vibrations around 1459 cm–1. The characteristic
bands of the copolymer can be noted to stretching vibration of the
carbonyl group at 1732 cm–1, the deformational stretching
vibrations of the secondary amine functional group at 2773–2790
cm–1, and the stretching vibration of C–N
bond at 1120–1170 cm–1, related to the DMAEMA
content in the structure. The band around 1640 cm–1 arising from the C=O stretching vibration mode, the C–N
stretching vibrations appear around 1410 cm–1 due
to the VP units in the copolymer.

The membrane structure of PERVAP 4155-30 and PERVAP 4155-70
was
analyzed by SEM, and the cross-section of the membranes is shown in Figure 3. The PVA and copolymer-based
selective layer is at the upper part of membrane tightly adhered to
the polyacrylonitrile porous support (bottom), and neither of the
PERVAP 4155-30 and 4155-70 samples have voids, indicating a good compatibility
between the porous support and the selective layer. In both cases,
the membrane thickness is around 2 μm. These representative
SEM images are tilted, and thus, in addition to the membrane cross-section,
the surfaces of the composite membranes are also visible, which are
uniform.

Unlike other reports on membranes with pH-responsive nature,
where
the membranes are first treated with acidic and basic aqueous solutions
before testing, here the membranes are not pretreated and are continuously
contacted by different mixtures. The pervaporation tests are performed
by using MeAc/water mixtures containing HCl and NaOH, and in both
cases, the concentration is controlled (2 mmol/L). We have controlled
the HCl and NaOH concentration because the pH measurement in organic
mixtures is not reliable due to the unstable readings, long response
time, measurement errors, and because pH is a measure of H+ concentration in aqueous solutions.

The pervaporation operating
conditions were identical for all tests,
that is neutral, acidic, and basic condition. Therefore, the comparison
of flux and permeate concentration as separation performance data
is possible. Two set of pervaporation tests were performed. On one
hand, for each mixture and for each test, a new membrane sample was
used. On the other hand, the same membrane was tested in all conditions
to see the reversibility of separation performance. The order of tests
was as follows: neutral, acidic, neutral, basic, and neutral.

The water flux and permeate concentration as a function of feed
water concentration for both membranes are shown in Figure 4. The permeate concentration
values (red circle data) for PERVAP 4155-30 (Figure 4a) are slightly lower than those for PERVAP
4155-70 (Figure 4b).
These results are expected due to the cross-linking degree of the
membranes. PERVAP 4155-30 has 70 wt % of copolymer and 30 wt % of
PVA, and because of PVA content in the membrane, this membrane is
less cross-linked than PERVAP 4155-70. The content of PVA in the polymer
matrix is directly correlated with the degree of cross-linking, that
is, the higher the PVA content in the membrane, the higher the cross-linking
degree (information received from DeltaMem AG). Because PERVAP 4155-30
is less cross-linked than PERVAP 4155-70, it swells more (see Figure 5) and presents slightly
lower values of water permeate concentration.

°C and 10 mbar under different conditions (black square: acidic,
red circle: neutral, green triangle: basic).

with different P(VP-co-DMAEMA) and PVA ratios in
water and various binary (MeAc/water) mixtures.

The permeate concentration values in PERVAP 4155-70 are not
dependent
on feed nature (acidic, neutral or basic). While for PERVAP 4155-30
in acidic condition, they are shifted to higher values (Figure 4a). The water permeate concentration
increase in this membrane is due to the presence of the pH-responsive
copolymer and its high content; hence, under acidic condition, this
membrane swells less and is more hydrophilic (discussed later), and
thus, the selectivity of the membrane is improved.

Pervaporation
tests performed with neutral mixture show that PERVAP
4155-30 exhibits higher water flux than PERVAP 4155-70 (compare open
red circle in Figure 4a,b). This difference is also explained by the content of PVA in
the membrane (cross-linking degree and swelling of membrane, described
above). As PERVAP 4155-30 has 70 wt % of copolymer, the shifting of
water flux to lower values is more pronounced than that in PERVAP
4155-70, when the pervaporation tests are performed in acidic conditions
(compare the red and black experimental points). The decrease of water
flux and the increase of permeate concentration are interesting results,
and they are attributed to the DMAEMA units in the copolymer. As described
above, the P(DMAEMA) is a pH-responsive polymer, and thus, this segment
of copolymer is protonated in acidic mixture. Because of amine protonation
and the presence of PVA (containing −OH) and Cl– ions (from HCl), the free movement of copolymer segment containing
the protonated amine is slowed down, and the material as such does
not swell or slightly shrinks (PERVAP 4155-30, Figure 5). This makes the material less flexible
and decreases the fractional free volume of polymer that results in
a water flux decrease through the membrane and selectivity improvement.

Under basic conditions, the pervaporation tests gave even more
interesting results. At the beginning, at higher water concentration
in the mixture, the water flux is higher than in the neutral condition
(see the open green triangle at >2.5 wt % of water in feed, Figure 4). After the mixture
is dehydrated, the water flux drops to lower values like in acidic
conditions. These results can be partially explained by the decreased
swelling of the membrane (Figure 5) and by the hydrophilic nature of the material under
basic conditions (Figure 6). High water content in the mixture under basic conditions
and the hydrophilic nature of material seem to increase the swelling
of the membrane. However, it happens only at the beginning of tests.
Later, once the MeAc is dehydrated, a pronounced decrease of flux
is observed. This behavior can be explained by the gradual deprotonation
of amine groups and simultaneous hydrogen bonding between deprotonated
amine and OH- groups present in PVA. At the end, the material (membrane)
becomes less swollen because of the lower water content in the mixture,
the membrane shrinks, and consequently the water flux drops. Because
of a complex mechanism of deprotonation and formation of hydrogen
bonds, the PVP segment present in the copolymer may also play a certain
role on water flux decrease.

membranes (a) CAs after
different treatments and (b) their representative shapes of water
drops.

As discussed above, the swelling
and hydrophilicity of the selective
layer play important roles in the pervaporation process. The degree
of swelling of the membranes depends on the composition and the structure
of the polymer matrix. Thus, PERVAP 4155-30 and 4155-70 should exhibit
different behavior in terms of swelling. This investigation is carried
out by using dense films in pure water and mixtures used for pervaporation
tests, that is, binary mixtures of MeAc and water in neutral, acidic,
and basic conditions.

The swelling degree of these films is
presented in Figure 5. In general, it is observed
that the degree of swelling of PERVAP 4155-30 is higher than PERVAP
4155-70. This is due to the cross-linking degree of the membrane (less
content of PVA means less degree of cross-linking) and hydrophilic
nature of the copolymer. The swelling of films in binary (MeAc/water)
mixtures is less than that in water, and this can be explained by
the wettability properties of polymer system itself. In mixtures containing
acid, the swelling of membrane PERVAP 4155-30 decreases compared to
neutral mixtures. Thus, this result agrees with the water flux decrease.
However, PERVAP 4155-70 does not show remarkable changes in swelling
degree between tests in water, neutral and acidic mixture. This result
may be due to the high content of PVA in the membrane (high degree
of cross-linking).

In basic conditions, both types of membranes
do not swell at all
(Figure 5). This observation
supports the pervaporation results well (Figure 4), where a decrease of water flux is observed
once the MeAc is dehydrated.

The hydrophilicity of the PERVAP
4155 membrane surface with different
PVA content was studied by static CA with water as a probe liquid.
As shown in Figure 6, the CA of the liquid decreased with increasing PVA content in the
membrane. This means that the PERVAP 4155-70 is more hydrophilic than
PERVAP 4155-30 because of more hydroxyl group in the membrane (higher
PVA content) as well as because of the slightly different roughness
of membrane surface, derived from the different composition. In other
words, higher PVA content in the membrane produces a smoother, continuous
hydrophilic surface.

PERVAP 4155-30 samples exhibit slightly
different CA when they
are treated with different liquid mixtures. In basic conditions, this
membrane becomes more hydrophilic, while PERVAP 4155-70 does not show
notable changes.

It should be noted that during the pervaporation
tests at different
conditions (basic and acidic) random ring-opening of the pyrrolidone
ring in the copolymer may occur, which can facilitate the polymer
chain reconfiguration and constructs hydrogen bonding with the DMAEMA
units in the polymer system.37−41 The presence of opened ring VP units were analyzed by ATR–FTIR
and confirmed by the appearance of the characteristic band at around
1732 cm–1, corresponding to the carboxyl acid group
in the ring-opened VP.42 To prove the structural
rearrangement and the ring-opening, the cross-linked free-standing
dense films made from P(VP-co-DMAEMA) and PVA were
exposed to the acidic and basic mixtures under the same conditions
used in pervaporation tests. A slight color change was observed in
the case of acidic treatment.

Figure 7a shows
the ATR–FTIR spectra of the neutral and the acid and base treated
samples at 85 °C. A characteristic peak at around 1650 cm–1 represents the carbonyl moiety present in the VP
unit, and after treatment, a new characteristic peak of carboxylic
acid group appeared at around 1720 cm–1, revealing
that ring opening occurred during the treatment of the samples in
acidic and basic conditions. The treated samples were also used for
swelling measurements in pure water and in binary MeAc/water mixtures
(Figure 7b); this was
done to investigate the possible self cross-linking of the polymeric
material. After the samples are treated in both acidic and basic conditions,
the PERVAP 4155-30 sample exhibited lower equilibrium swelling degree,
especially in MeAc/water mixtures, and thus, because of high amount
of the P(VP-co-DMAEMA) in this sample, the additional
self cross-linking due to the ring-opening can be confirmed by these
tests. The PERVAP 4155-70 sample also showed an evidence of the ring-opening
VP (Figure 7a), but
according to the swelling measurements, the additional self cross-linking
could not be noticed (Figure 7b). Contrary to PERVAP 4155-30, this result can be explained
by the PVA content in this sample, which might suppress this effect
and act as a stabilizing matrix.

Figure 7 (a) ATR–FTIR spectra of the treated
free-standing dense
films (scan number: 128, nominal resolution: 4 cm–1) and (b) equilibrium swelling ratio (%) of the original (O), basic
(B), and acidic (A) treated free-standing dense films (in water and
neutral binary MeAc/water mixture).

The appearance of the new characteristic band of the carboxyl
acid
group in the treated samples and the swelling tests corroborate the
separation performance change during the pervaporation tests under
different conditions, that is, it contributed to water flux decrease,
which can be due to the self cross-linking and hydrogen bonding between
the carboxylic acid group and amine from P(DMAEMA) segment and PVA.

By last, to confirm the responsive nature of these membranes and
their reversibility, additional pervaporation tests were performed
with the same membrane sample by using different mixtures, as follows:
neutral−acid−neutral−basic−neutral.

Figure 8 shows the
results for this set of experiments. The trend and range of water
flux and permeate concentration are like previous experiments, this
means the measurements are highly reproducible and the membranes show
a responsive behavior. However, the water flux with neutral mixture
after the experiments with acidic and basic mixture, does not recover
as the initial values. This phenomenon could be explained as follows:
(i) the cleaning of membrane may require multiple steps (long-term
washing) to remove the remaining H+ from the membrane after
the tests with acidic mixture, and (ii) the separation property of
membrane is not entirely reversible, suggested because of the chemical
changes. As ring-opening might occur during the pervaporation test
in acidic and basic conditions, the amine and carboxylic acid moieties
can further react to lead to an amide moiety, inducing self cross-linking
of the material.41 Therefore, although
the membranes have pH-responsive nature, the separation performance
in terms of water flux could not be recovered once the membrane is
exposed to acidic and basic mixtures. So, the results show that chemical
changes and self cross-linking could have happened in the polymer
system, that is, the polymer matrix is more cross-linked and is responsible
for the water flux decrease.

4155-30 and (b)

neutral to acidic and from neutral to basic condition at 85 °C
and 10 mbar (black square: acidic, red circles: neutral (various stages),
green triangle: basic).

The change of separation performance in pervaporation processes
(in this case the water flux and permeate concentration) is very important
during the process design and industrial plant sizing. Thus, the information
got from this work is profitable for membrane developers and end users.
In addition, the observed membrane behavior can be used in a useful
way, especially in mixtures where acidic and basic compounds are present,
for example, for obtaining higher water flux at higher water concentration
in basic mixtures, for enhancing the selectivity or for preventing
the separation performance change, that is, by neutralizing the acidic
and basic mixtures before the streams go to the membrane modules.

Conclusions
Two commercial pervaporation membranes containing P(VP-co-DMAEMA) were investigated as pH-responsive membranes.
The copolymer itself, the composite membrane, and dense films were
characterized in detail to understand the pH-responsive nature of
these membranes.

By changing the MeAc/water mixture nature from
neutral to acidic
and from neutral to basic mixture, the water flux through the membrane
dropped during the dehydration of MeAc by pervaporation. In PERVAP
4155-30, the water permeate concentration was enhanced. This membrane
behavior was attributed to swelling and shrinking of the polymer matrix
because of the presence of DMAEMA units in the copolymer.

Pervaporation
tests carried out with the same membrane sample under
neutral, acidic, and basic conditions showed that the membrane performance
(water flux) change is irreversible once the conditions changed. As
proposed, the chemical structure changes occurred in the polymer system.
Ring opening of VP units and self cross-linking has been hypothesized
and later confirmed by the sample analyses.

Because these membranes
are commercial and they are industrially
applied for neutral mixtures, stability tests under acidic and basic
conditions are needed to confirm if subsequent changes occur for a
longer period. Thus, depending on the application and impurities present
in the mixture, the pH-responsive nature of these membranes can be
advantageous.
