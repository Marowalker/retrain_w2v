In
the current paper, we successfully developed and used metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) based on MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 with phosphorus
acid functional groups MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2. The synthesized metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs) as a multi-functional heterogeneous and nanoporous catalyst
were used for the synthesis of N-amino-2-pyridone
and pyrano [2,3-c]pyrazole derivatives via reaction
of ethyl cyanoacetate or ethyl acetoacetate, hydrazine hydrate, malononitrile,
and various aldehydes. The final step of the reaction mechanism was
preceded by a cooperative vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation. Recycle
and reusability of the described catalyst MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 were also investigated.

1 Introduction
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as
a new category of nanoporous material. They have been used for various
purposes such as storage and separation of gas, catalysts, and heavy-metal
adsorption.1−5 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) based on the type of their
ligands and functional groups on their surface exhibit different properties.
Their functional groups may be initially present in the organic ligand
structures or after synthesizing MOFs to create functional groups
within the structure.6 Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) exhibit a unique catalytic role in the preparation
of hydrogen and methane gas and the synthesis of a wide range of chemical
and pharmaceutical compounds. These compounds have shown a unique
catalytic power due to their nanosize and porous structures with various
functional groups.5,7,8 Developing
Cr-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is envisaged to achieve
the goals such as: higher surface area, enhanced adsorption, water,
and thermal stability in the course of reaction processes.9,10

Phosphorous acid and its derivatives are used as reagents,
absorbents,
catalysts for the preparation of food additives, precursor for the
synthesis of phosphate fertilizers,11 and
in pharmaceutical industries due to their nontoxicity as pH regulators.
The design and synthesis of catalysts with phosphorous acid moieties
are an attractive research proposal due to their biocompatibility.
Recently, we have reported glycoluril, MIL-100(Cr)/En, and mesoporous
SBA-15 with phosphorous acid tags.12−16 Design, synthesis, and use of metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) with phosphorous acid arms due to their properties
of recovery, reuse, and high efficiency are suitable catalysts in
the chemical processes.

Heterocyclic moieties have been used
as important building blocks
within a wide range of medicinal and biologically active molecules.17−19 Two of the most important subclasses of heterocyclic chemistry are
oxygen- and nitrogen-containing rings, which can be found in the skeletal
structures of various types of biologically active and pharmaceutical
compounds20,21 (Scheme 1). Among oxygen and nitrogen hetreocycles, the N-amino-2-pyridones and pyrano [2,3-c]pyrazoles
have been shown to have anticancer, anticoagulant, anticonvulsant,
antimicrobial, anti-HIV, antimalarial, antitumor, antibacterial, antifungal,
and antitumor properties.

Scheme 1 Biological Compounds Containing Heterocyclic
in the Structure
In spite of large
usage of N-amino-2-pyridones
and pyrano [2,3-c]pyrazoles, only a few procedures
have been developed for their synthesis, using piperidine, ZnO, sodium l-ascorbatea, and nano-MIIZr(PO4)6 as catalysts.22−25 Therefore, the development of new methodologies for the preparation
of N-amino-2-pyridones and pyrano [2,3-c]pyrazoles is in great demand.

In the continuation of our previous
investigation on the applications
of catalysts with phosphorous acid functional groups, we have decided
to design and synthesize a novel MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 with phosphorous acidic arms as
nanoporous MOFs and heterogeneous catalyst for the one-pot synthesis
of pyrano [2,3-c]pyrazoles and N-amino-2-pyridones. The desired compounds were produced through the
condensation of ethyl cyanoacetate or ethyl acetoacetate, hydrazine
hydrate, malononitrile, and various aldehydes via a cooperative vinylogous
anomeric-based oxidation mechanism and under solvent-free conditions
(Scheme 2).

of N-Amino-2-pyridones and Pyrano [2,3-c]pyrazoles in Four-Component Reaction
2 Results and Discussion
In this paper, we reported a
clean method for the preparation of
MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 as a metal–organic framework (MOFs) by the one-pot reaction
of MIL-101(Cr)-NH2, formaldehyde, phosphorous acid, and p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA) under refluxing
EtOH. This catalyst was fully characterized by Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX), elemental mapping analysis, the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermal gravimetric
(TG), derivative thermal gravimetric (DTG), differential thermal analysis
(DTA), and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET). Also, MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 was tested for the synthesis of N-amino-2-pyridone
and pyrano [2,3-c]pyrazole derivatives.

The
FT-IR spectrum of MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 and MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 is compared in Figure 1. The broad peak
at 2600–3500 cm–1 was related to the OH of
PO3H2 groups. Also, the absorption bands observed
at 1021 and 1081 cm–1 are related to the P–O
bond stretching and that at 1146 cm–1 is related
to P=O.26 Furthermore, peaks of
Cr–O of octahedral CrO6 appeared at 1391 cm–1 respectively27 (Figure 1). The FT-IR spectrum difference
between MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 and MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 confirmed the structure
of the catalyst.

Figure 1 FT-IR spectra of MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 and MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2.

The presenting elements can be seen in the structure and morphology
of MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), elemental mapping
analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Through energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and elemental mapping analysis, chrome, carbon,
nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphor were confirmed in the structure of
MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 (Figure 2).

X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and elemental mapping
analysis of MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2.

MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 and
MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 structures were calculated in the
range of 2–80° using XRD as shown in Figure 3. The XRD patterns of our synthesized
MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 matched well with those reported in the
literature,57,58 confirming the formation of MIL-101(Cr)-NH2. The main Bragg reflection around 2θ = 10 confirmed
the successful synthesis of MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 as the MOF
structure. The pattern of the phosphonic acid grafted MOF materials
exhibits a very similar profile to the pattern of the as-synthesized
MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 and is composed of main diffraction peaks
of the MOF, confirming that the structures of MIL-101 (Cr)-NH2 remained intact with no apparent loss of crystallinity but
with some slight decrease in peak intensities along with an increase
in phosphonic acid contents due to the partial filling by the grafting
guest molecules.

The shape, morphology, and elements of MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 and MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 were studied using SEM analysis. SEM images of MOFs
catalyst
reveal that the particles are cauliflower and the particle size is
within the range of the nanoscales 13.77 and 30.55 (Figures 4 and 5). Figure 6 also shows
the results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2. Morphology and topology
of MOF catalysts were confirmed to be quasi-cube structure. The particles
of MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 were observed to of nano size (approximately 30–40 nm) with
proper dispersion.

Thermal gravimetric (TG) analysis and differential thermal analysis
(DTA) of MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 are shown in Figure 7. Two declining stages were observed for MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 in the TG pattern.
The amount of weight loss is estimated to be 5–7%, which can
be attributed to the decreases in solvent (organic and water). The
results show that the catalyst can be used up to 220 °C, which
can be related to the departure of PO3H2 arms
and decomposition of the structure of MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 (Figure 7).

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 and MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 were measured and the results are presented in Figure 8a,c. Observation
of hysteresis loops for both of them means that the prepared catalysts
are mesoporous. The obtained BET surface areas of MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 and MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 are 1708 and 528 m2 g–1, respectively. Their total pore volumes are 1.46 and 0.38 cm3 g–1, respectively. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore size distribution data are presented in Figure 8b,d, showing that most of the
pores for both samples are smaller than 10 nm.

After the structure
of MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 was approved, it was used as a MOFs catalyst
for the synthesis of N-amino-2-pyridones and pyrano
[2,3-c]pyrazoles. To synthesizeN-amino-2-pyridones, the four-part reaction between ethyl cyanoacetate
(1 mmol, 0.113 g), hydrazine hydrate (1.2 mmol, 0.060 g), malononitrile
(1.1 mmol, 0.072 g) and benzaldehyde (1 mmol, 0.106 g) under refluxing
solvents such as: water, ethanol, acetonitrile, n-hexane solvents and solvent-free in the presence a catalytic amount
of MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 was tested, the results of which are shown in Table 1. The results are summarized in Table 1. The results show
that refluxing water is best of choice for producing N-amino-2-pyridones (Table 1, entry 1). Increasing the amount of catalyst did not show
any increase in efficiency (Table 1, entry 9). By decreasing the amounts of catalysts,
a decrease in efficiency was observed (Table 1, entries 7 and 8). Reducing the temperature
has increased the reaction time and reduced the efficiency of the
product (Table 1, entries
10–13).

After
optimization of the reaction conditions for the synthesis
of N-amino-2-pyridones, a wide range of aromatic
aldehydes, including electron withdrawal, electron release and heterocyclic
rings have been synthesized (Table 2). Then, to investigate the effect of the functional
group, ethyl acetoacetate replaced ethyl cyanoacetate, and it was
observed that the product of pyrano [2,3-c]pyrazoles
was synthesized by changing the cyano group to the carbonyl group.
Under optimal conditions for N-amino-2-pyridones,
a wide range of pyrano [2,3-c]pyrazoles were also
synthesized (Table 3). The results reveal that the described catalyst can produce N-amino-2-pyridones and pyrano [2,3-c]pyrazoles
derivatives in short reaction time and high efficiency.

Alabugin has recently comprehensively reviewed the
stereoelectronic
effects as a bridge between structure and reactivity.39−41 On the basis of Alabugin’s concept, we have recently introduced
a new term “vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation”.42−46 Vinylogous anomeric effect has been approved by Katritzky.47 In the cooperative vinylogous anomeric-based
oxidation mechanism, through a multicomponent reaction strategy, starting
materials interact with each other to yield a suitable intermediate.
The vinylogous anomeric effect is the major driving force of oxidation
and/or aromatization of intermediate for preparing the desired product.
For example, in the case of 2-amino-4,6-diphenylnicotinonitrile a
cooperative vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation mechanism occurs at
the related intermediate (Scheme 3).48 A wide range of aromatized
molecules through the described mechanism have been reported.49

Scheme 3 Cooperative Vinylogous Anomeric-Based Oxidation
Leads to the Production
of 2-Amino-4,6-diphenylnicotinonitrile
The anomeric effect can lead to bond weakening in a wide range
of organic reactions. For example, recently we have suggested that
in the Cannizzaro reaction after the addition of hydroxide (OH–) to the carbonyl group of aldehydes which did not
have α-hydrogen (Scheme 4), both the lone pairs of electrons of oxygen atoms within
the tetrahedral carbon shared their electrons in the antibonding orbital
of the C–H bond (nN → σ*C–H) and weakened it. The resulting labile hydride acts as a powerful
nucleophile that attacks the second molecule of aldehyde. Finally,
this reaction produced equal amounts of corresponding alcohol and
acid.50

Scheme 4 Anomeric-Based Oxidation Leads to
Hydride Transfer in the Mechanism
of Cannizzaro Reaction
On the basis of the above-mentioned background, a rational mechanism
for the synthesis of N-amino-2-pyridones based on
a cooperative vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation for the final step
is suggested in Scheme 5. At first, the carbonyl group of aldehyde is activated by the acidic
group of MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2. Malononitrile reacts with the carbonyl group of aldehyde
to afford an intermediate I by removing one molecule
of H2O. Then, compound (A) attacks intermediate I as a Michael acceptor to give intermediate II. Further,
intermediate II with intramolecular cyclocondensation
reacts to give III. Finally, intermediate III was derived via a cooperative vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation
(−H2) to give the desired product (Scheme 5). It should be noted that
the target reaction was also carried out under argon and nitrogen
atmospheres to make sure that the final desired product was not produced
via an aerobic oxidation pathway. The reaction was performed successfully
under the air atmosphere. Thus, our evidence shows that the target
reaction was preceded via a cooperative vinylogous anomeric-based
oxidation mechanism.

Scheme 5 Proposed Mechanism for the Synthesis N-Amino-2-pyridones
Using MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2
To evaluate the performance
of MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 as a catalyst for the preparation
of N-amino-2-pyridones, we have used various organic
and inorganic acid catalysts for the condensation reaction between
4-nitro benzaldehyde (1 mmol, 0.151 g), ethyl cyanoacetate (1 mmol,
0.113 g), hydrazine hydrate (1.2 mmol, 0.060 g), and malononitrile
(1.1 mmol, 0.072 g) (Table 3). As indicated in Table 3, MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 is the best catalyst for the synthesis of N-amino-2-pyridone derivatives (Table 4).

According to the results
in Figure 9, MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 can be separated
by centrifugation and reused without
significantly reducing its catalytic activity. For this purpose, recyclability
of the catalyst was tested in the reaction between 4-nitro benzaldehyde
(1 mmol, 0.151 g), ethyl cyanoacetate (1 mmol, 0.113 g), hydrazine
hydrate (1.2 mmol, 0.060 g), and malononitrile (1.1 mmol, 0.072 g)
as a model reaction under the above-mentioned optimized reaction conditions.
Therefore, MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 can be reused up to six runs without noticeable changes
in the catalytic activity.

3 Conclusions
After
the preparation of metal–organic framework MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 with phosphorous acid functional groups, its structure was
approved. The presented MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 was successfully applied for producing
a wide range of pyrano [2,3-c]pyrazole and N-amino-2-pyridone derivatives via cooperative vinylogous
anomeric-based oxidation mechanism. Short reaction times, clean profile
of reaction, easy work-up, recyclability, and reusability of catalyst
are advantages of the presented methodology.

4.1 General Procedure for the Preparation of MIL-101(Cr)-NH2
MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 was synthesized according
to our previously reported experimental procedure.57,58 A mixture of Cr(NO3)3·9(H2O) (2 mmol, 0.8 g), 2-aminoterephthalic acid (2 mmol, 0.362 g), and
sodium hydroxide (5 mmol, 0.2 g) was dispersed and then stirred in
20 mL of water for 10 min. The resulting solution was heated in a
Teflon-lined autoclave at 150 °C for 12 h. After cooling the
reaction mixture to room temperature, the green solid was collected,
washed with dimethylformamide (DMF), and then further purified by
solvothermal treatment in ethanol at 100 °C for 24 h. Finally,
the desired product was dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven.

4.2 General Procedure for the Preparation of MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2
In a 50

(0.33 mL, 9 mmol), phosphorus acid (0.665 mL, 9 mmol), p-TSA (10 mol %, 0.017 g), and ethanol (25 mL) were refluxed for 8
h. Then, it was washed three times with ethanol and dried in a vacuum
oven at 70 °C to obtain MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2 (1.7 g) (Scheme 6). The amount of phosphorus is 4.56% of the
MOFs component of MIL-101(Cr)-N(CH2PO3H2)2.

the reaction progress. After the reaction was completed, the solvent
was evaporated and then 2 mL of ethylene glycol was added to the reaction
mixture. The catalyst was removed from the reaction using centrifugation
at 1000 rpm. The product was purified using 96% ethanol (Scheme 2).
