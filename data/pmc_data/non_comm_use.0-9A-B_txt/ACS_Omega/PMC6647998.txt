Functional amyloid (FA) proteins
have evolved to assemble into
fibrils with a characteristic cross-β structure, which stabilizes
biofilms and contributes to bacterial virulence. Some of the most
studied bacterial FAs are the curli protein CsgA, expressed in a wide
range of bacteria, and FapC, produced mainly by members of the Pseudomonas genus. Though unrelated, both CsgA and
FapC contain imperfect repeats believed to drive the formation of
amyloid fibrils. While much is known about CsgA biogenesis and fibrillation,
the mechanism of FapC fibrillation remains less explored. Here, we
show that removing the three imperfect repeats of FapC (FapC ΔR1R2R3)
slows down the fibrillation but does not prevent it. The increased
lag phase seen for FapC ΔR1R2R3 allows for disulfide bond formation,
which further delays fibrillation. Remarkably, these disulfide-bonded
species of FapC ΔR1R2R3 also significantly delay the fibrillation
of human α-synuclein, a key protein in Parkinson’s disease
pathology. This attenuation of α-synuclein fibrillation was
not seen for the reduced form of FapC ΔR1R2R3. The results presented
here shed light on the FapC fibrillation mechanism and emphasize how
unrelated fibrillation systems may share such common fibril formation
mechanisms, allowing inhibitors of one fibrillating protein to affect
a completely different protein.

Introduction
Amyloid fibrils are
nonbranched protein aggregates with a high
content of β-sheets arranged so that the β-strands are
perpendicular to the fibril axis.1,2 They are often
associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s3 and Parkinson’s (PD),4 where the brain accumulates intra- or extracellular deposits
of misfolded protein. Fibril formation is a complex multistage mechanism
with a sigmoidal time line, whose critical steps involve nucleation
and elongation.5,6 The rate-limiting step is the
formation of oligomeric nuclei from monomeric precursors during the
so-called lag phase. The nuclei can act as seeds and initiate fibril
growth, leading to relatively fast fibril elongation once the nuclei
have accumulated beyond a certain threshold level. This process continues
until most of the soluble protein has been incorporated into the fibrils
and there is an equilibrium between association and dissociation of
monomeric protein at the fibril ends.

Amyloids also play useful
roles in cell biology, particularly in
bacteria where functional amyloid (FA) provides structural stability
to bacterial biofilms,7,8 forms protective sheaths,9,10 or contributes to bacterial virulence.11 These proteins are evolutionarily optimized to fibrillate and do
not adopt a stable tertiary structure on the monomeric level but couple
folding to fibrillation. Nevertheless, the time course of fibrillation
remains sigmoidal12,13 because of the need to accumulate
and elongate the fibrillation nuclei.14 The first FA to be described was CsgA, the main component of curli
fibrils in Escherichia coli and other
bacteria.15,16 CsgA consists almost exclusively of five
∼20-residue imperfect repeats17 connected
by short four–five aa loop regions.18 Each repeat is predicted to form a β-hairpin, all five of
which stack on top of each other in the amyloid structure.19 An unrelated FA system has been identified in Pseudomonas biofilms.20 The main protein component in FAs in Pseudomonas (fap) is the FapC protein, which differs from CsgA in several ways.
It contains only three ∼35-residue imperfect repeats (R1, R2,
and R3), and these are connected by less well-conserved linker regions
(L1 and L2) of variable (30–275 residues) lengths20 and unknown functions. Stepwise removal of the
three FapC repeats increases both fibrillation lag times and the tendency
of the growing fibrils to fragment.21 In
CsgA, the repeats are also predicted to form a β-hairpin structure,
which makes up the core of the mature fibrils,22 whereas the linkers are proposed to form solvent-exposed
flexible regions.23 The increased length
of FapC repeats leads to a fibril width of 4.5 nm as opposed to 3
nm for CsgA.23 Unlike CsgA, FapC has a
conserved C-terminal CXXC motif, which is not thought to be part of
the fibril core but may promote interfiber connections.23

Both FapC and CsgA are expressed from
dedicated FA operons that
also encode chaperones, outer membrane proteins, and nucleator proteins.16,20,22,24−26 The chaperone proteins help avoid intracellular aggregation27 and ensure that the proteins are secreted as
unstructured proteins.28 Interestingly,
two chaperone proteins from the curli system, CsgC and CsgH, share
the same structural fold and inhibit fibrillation of not only CsgA
but also FapC29 and human α-synuclein
(α-SN),27,30 indicating similar features in
the fibrillation of these proteins. The small-molecule epigallocatechin-3-gallate
(EGCG) also inhibits fibrillation of both FapC,31 human α-SN32,33 and Aβ42,32 which is proposed to be involved in
Alzheimer’s disease. Interestingly, both the curli system chaperone
CsgE and the small organic 2-pyridone compound named FN075 efficiently
inhibit CsgA fibrillation,34−36 but at the same time these molecules accelerate the fibrillation of human α-SN.30,37 Altogether, these studies show that small molecules or proteins,
probably due to common fibrillation mechanisms and the common cross-β
structure of the mature amyloid fibrils, can affect different—and
unrelated—amyloidogenic target proteins but that these interactions
can result in opposite effects. Globular proteins are protected against
amyloid fibrillation by their native fold, which sequesters amyloidogenic
and hydrophobic regions of the proteins within the protein interior.
Fibrillation requires conditions that favor protein unfolding or denaturation,
leading to exposure of these regions and subsequent misfolding.38 In contrast, intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDPs) lack a stable tertiary structure39 and therefore do not have the same barriers to aggregation. One
such prominent IDP is the 140-residue protein α-SN, recognized
for its involvement in PD, where it forms intracytoplasmic protein
deposits referred to as Lewy bodies (LBs) or Lewy neurites (LNs).
In the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain, this results
in a loss of dopaminergic neurons, ultimately leading to a number
of motor symptoms.40 In addition, gastrointestinal
(GI) dysfunction is also commonly reported by PD patients,41 indicating roles for the GI tract and the enteric
nervous system (ENS) in PD. In fact, LBs and LNs are often observed
in the neurons of the ENS in early stages of PD,42−45 and recently the appendix was
suggested to play an important role in PD initiation.46

Human α-SN has been shown to be transported
retrogradely
from the GI tract to the lower brain regions via the vagus nerve.47,48 In the ENS, the great majority of neurons are located in the wall
of the GI tract,49 extend throughout the
different layers of the GI tract, and connect directly with enteroendocrine
cells,50 which express various toll-like
receptors and are able recognize different microbial structures.51 As an example, curli fibrils are recognized
by TLR1 and TLR2 and mediate interleukin 1β production,52,53 and this way, the bacteria in our microbiome may interact with our
central nervous system through the ENS. Rodent studies have shown
that the bacterial composition in our microbiome or products produced
by these bacteria can lead to increased α-SN deposition, possibly
by activating the immune system or causing increased intestinal permeability,
both within the GI tract54,55 and in the brain.56,57

Feeding aged rats with curli-producing E. coli leads to an increase in α-SN aggregation compared to animals
that had been fed with a curli-deficient E. coli strain,57 indicating that microbiomic
FAs contribute to PD pathogenesis. Because bacteria belonging to the
genus Pseudomonas spp. have been found
to be relatively abundant in healthy individuals,58 we decided to search for evidence of any cross-interactions
between FapC and human α-SN. To also study the role of imperfect
repeats in wild-type FapC (henceforth referred to as FapC), we also
included a FapC variant lacking all three repeats (FapC ΔR1R2R3).
Although this mutant still forms thioflavin T (ThT)-positive amyloid-like
fibrils, the process is significantly slower, and the resulting fibrils
are thinner and more fragmented than their wild-type counterpart,
not only confirming the importance of the repeats in driving fibrillation
but also revealing a remarkable hidden amyloidogenicity in the linker
regions. Remarkably, substoichiometric amounts of FapC ΔR1R2R3
delayed α-SN fibrillation up to 4-fold, whereas FapC had no
effect. Because of the CXXC motif in both FapC and FapC ΔR1R2R3,
the proteins could still form dimers, trimers, and higher order oligomers
during purification; whereas suppression of disulfide bond formation
under reducing conditions had no effect on FapC fibrillation, it significantly
accelerated the fibrillation of FapC ΔR1R2R3 and at the same
time abolished its ability to inhibit α-SN fibrillation. Thus,
removal of the repeats slows down fibrillation to an extent where
disulfide bond formation is favored. The disulfide-bonded protein
species (dimers, trimers, and higher order oligomers) are able to
interact with (and inhibit) both fibrillation of FapC ΔR1R2R3
itself and of human α-SN. The results presented here reveal
how different fibrillation systems may share common fibril formation
mechanisms, which allow for inhibitors of one system to affect a completely
different system. In this specific case, the amyloidogenicity of FapC
had to be reduced below a certain level to favor interaction with
α-SN and inhibition of fibrillation. Thus, weakening the intrinsic,
highly efficient aggregation mechanism of FA may exacerbate deleterious
effects of otherwise benign amyloid.

Materials and Methods
Purification
of α-SN
Recombinant α-SN was
expressed using autoinduction59 and purified
as previously described.60

α-SN
Oligomer Formation
α-SN oligomers
were purified as previously described.61 Briefly, lyophilized α-SN was resuspended in a buffer to a
final concentration of 8 mg/mL (∼0.55 mM) and incubated for
5 h at 37 °C while shaking with 900 rpm. After centrifugation
(12 000g, 10 min, 4 °C), the sample was
loaded on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare), and oligomer
fractions were collected.

Design of the FapC Repeat Deletion Mutant
Protein
FapC
and FapC ΔR1R2R3 proteins were designed based on the FapC sequence
from Pseudomonas strain UK4. The proteins
were designed without the 24-residue N-terminal signal peptide and
with a C-terminal 6xHis-tag. The amino acid sequences are included
in Figure S1. Purification of His6-tagged
FapC and FapC ΔR1R2R3: Recombinant FapC (vector: pET28a, kanamycin
resistance) and FapC ΔR1R2R3 (vector: pET31b, ampicillin resistance)
were purified as previously described31 with a few modifications. In short, transformed E.
coli BL21(DE3) cells (Bioneer A/S) were grown on LB
agar plates for 24 h and then transferred to LB medium containing
antibiotics, 0.1% glucose, and 4 mM MgSO4. Cells were grown
to an OD600 of 0.6–0.8 before adding 1 mM isopropyl
β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and allowing protein expression
for 3 h. After cell harvest, the pellet was resuspended in 50 mL of
denaturation buffer (8 M GdmCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with one cOmplete
protease inhibitor tablet (Roche) per L medium and lysed by slow stirring
of the GdmCl-cell pellet suspension overnight at 4 °C. Cell debris
was pelleted by ultracentrifugation (17 000g, 30 min, 15 °C), and the supernatant was incubated with freshly
charged NiNTA beads for 1 h at 4 °C on a rolling table at 60
rpm. After washing the beads with first denaturation buffer and then
with washing buffer (8 M GdmCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 30 mM imidazole, pH
8.0), the proteins were eluted into 2 mL fractions with elution buffer
(8 M GdmCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). To check purity
and protein content of the individual elutions, 5 μL of each
elution was mixed with reducing loading buffer (G Biosciences) and
15 μL of Milli-Q (MQ) water and run on sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel. Eluted fractions
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80
°C. Note that both FapC constructs contain a C-terminal His6-extension to aid purification. The C-terminal part of FapC
is not part of the imperfect repeat, which is thought to be part of
the amyloid core, but is modelled in the recently computed structure
of FapC to be highly mobile,23 so we do
not expect the attachment of an additional C-terminal His-tag to have
any significant effect on fibrillation. In addition, we evaluate the
impact of removal of the repeats within the same His-tagged background.

SDS-PAGE
Samples were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C,
quickly spun down, and loaded on a 15% bistris SDS-polyacrylamide
gel. The samples from the protein purification steps contained 2 M
GdmCl, leading to precipitation in the loading buffer. We overcame
this by pipetting up and down to homogenize the samples before loading
them on the gel. Gels were run in a Bis-Tris running buffer at 150
V for 70 min, stained for 45 min in coomassie brilliant blue (CBB)
(1.2 mM CBB, 5% ethanol, and 7% acetic acid), and destained overnight
in a destaining solution (5% ethanol, 5% acetic acid).

ThT Fibrillation
Assay
Monomers of purified FapC proteins
were desalted from the elution buffer (8 M GdmCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl,
300 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer
in 0.5 mL fractions using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare).
Lyophilized α-SN was dissolved in PBS buffer and filtered through
a 0.2 μm filter. After measuring the concentration using a NanoDrop1000
(Thermo Scientific) spectrophotometer, the proteins were transferred
to a black 96-well Nunc optical bottom plate (Thermo Scientific).
Fibrillation followed with 40 μM ThT in a Tecan GENios Pro plate
reader with excitation at 448 nm and emission at 485 nm. In case “clean”
fibrils were needed (for dot blots), some wells were incubated without
ThT. The program was run at 37 °C with 120 rpm and a measurement
done every 124 s (FapC proteins alone) or with 600 rpm and a measurement
done every 720 s (samples containing α-SN). Lag time was determined
by normalizing the ThT fluorescence to 100%, by determining the slope
of the linear part of the curve between 16 and 80% fluorescence and
extrapolating its intersection with the x-axis. All
samples were run in triplicate unless otherwise stated. For each FapC
protein, the experiment was repeated three times. To estimate the
extent of fibrillation after the end of incubation, the contents of
different wells were thoroughly resuspended by pipetting and then
centrifuged in a bench-top centrifuge at maximal speed (13.5 K rpm)
for 15 min to pellet the insoluble material. The soluble fraction
was run on SDS-PAGE and subjected to densitometric analysis with ImageJ.
A control sample of monomeric FapC and FapC ΔR1R2R3 (prior to
fibrillation) was included for normalization of data.

Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy
The secondary
structure of the protein aggregates/fibrils was analyzed with infrared
spectroscopy using a Tensor 27 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) instrument
(Bruker Optics). The sample (2.0 μL) was deposited on an attenuated
total reflection crystal, dried with nitrogen gas, and analyzed with
the program OPUS version 5.5. Spectra were averaged over 68 scans
in the 1000–3999 cm–1 range. Data were analyzed
by calculating the atmospheric compensation, subtracting the baseline,
and preparing the second-derivative spectra. Only the amide I band
(1600–1700 cm–1) is shown.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy
The sample (5 μL)
was applied to a 400-mesh carbon-coated glow-discharged Ni grid, and
after 30 s, the grids were stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid (pH
7.0) and blotted dry on a filter paper. A transmission electron microscope
(JEM-1010, JEOL) operating at 60 kV was used to view the samples,
and images were obtained using an Olympus KeenViewG2 camera.

Dot Blots
with Alexa Fluor 546 Reactive Dye
α-SN
and FapC/FapCΔR1R2R3 fibrils were prepared by spinning down
ThT-free fibrils and measuring the monomer concentration left in the
supernatant. The fibril pellet was then resuspended to the desired
concentration in the PBS buffer. To fragment the fibrils, they were
sonicated briefly (α-SN fibrils) or for five cycles of 10 s
with 10 s on ice in between (FapC/FapCΔR1R2R3 fibrils) using
a Q125 sonicator with a 2 mm diameter probe (QSonica). Nitrocellulose
membranes (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad) were either incubated with a dilution
series of α-SN monomer, oligomer, and fibrils or with FapC/FapC
ΔR1R2R3 monomers and fibrils. PBS buffer was included as a negative
control. We used Ponceau S to verify that similar amounts of all of
the bait proteins were bound to the membrane. Membranes were incubated
with a Ponceau S solution (0.1% Ponceau S in 5% acetic acid) for 5
min with gentle agitation.62 Subsequently,
the membranes were washed with MQ water before blocking the membranes
for 1 h with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and washing them
in washing buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS buffer). After desalting
into PBS buffer on a PD10 column, FapC or FapC ΔR1R2R3 monomers
were incubated on ice (to minimize aggregation) for 1 h with Alexa
Fluor 546 reactive dye (Thermo Fischer Scientific) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The leftover probe was removed
in another desalting step, and 0.05 mg/mL (2.1 μM WT or 3.6
μM ΔR1R2R3) of labelled protein was incubated with the
membrane for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were
washed in 0.05% Tween 20 and visualized using a Typhoon scanner 9410
(Amersham Biosciences) when dry. The procedure is summarized in Figure S2.

Size Exclusion Chromatography
To investigate the formation
of mixed oligomers, 4 mg/mL (28 μM) α-SN with and without 2 mg/mL (84 or 144 μM)
freshly desalted FapC/FapC ΔR1R2R3 was incubated with shaking
(700 rpm) for 4.25 h at 37 °C in PBS and centrifuged (13 500g, 2 min) to remove larger aggregates. Then, 300 μL
hereof was loaded on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare)
with an ÄKTA Pure protein purification system (GE Healthcare)
at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. For samples containing FapC ΔR1R2R3,
the experiments were repeated in the presence of 20 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), and 500 μL of fractions were collected.

Dot Blots
with Antibodies
From the size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) experiment, fractions 1–4 (elution volumes between 12.25
and 14.25 mL) (Figure 4A) containing the small oligomer were pooled and concentrated using
a 0.5 mL Amicon centrifugation filter with a 30 K cutoff (Merck Millipore).
Concentration was determined with a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo
Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The
concentrated oligomers were then applied to two nitrocellulose membranes
together with duplicates of 1 μg of freshly desalted FapC ΔR1R2R3
and 1 μg of monomeric human α-SN before the membranes
were allowed to dry. PBS buffer was used as the control. After drying,
the membranes were blocked with 0.5% BSA (w/v) in PBS buffer for 40
min at 4 °C before thoroughly washing them in the washing buffer.
Primary antibodies were added to the membranes. One membrane was incubated
with anti-α-SN mouse monoclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
catalog # sc-69977), and another membrane was incubated with anti-FapC
rabbit polyclonal IgG.63 Both the membranes
were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed
in the washing buffer before adding the secondary antibodies against
either mouse [horseradish peroxidase (HRP) goat anti-mouse IgG, #115-035-146]
or rabbit (HRP goat anti-rabbit IgG, #111-035-144) (Jackson ImmunoResearch,
USA) and incubated for an additional 1 h at room temperature. After
washing the membranes in the washing buffer, protein binding was visualized
using TMB Blotting PLUS solution (Kem-En-Tec Diagnostics A/S). Densitometric
quantification was performed with ImageJ (https://imagej.net/).

Fibril Stability
in Urea
FapC ΔR1R2R3 fibrils
were made by incubating freshly desalted protein at 37 °C, 700
rpm for 48 h either with or without 20 mM DTT. Fibrils were spun down
(13 500 rpm, 15 min) in a table centrifuge. The mass of pelleted protein
fibrils was calculated based on the supernatant protein concentration
(determined through A280). The fibrils were resuspended
in PBS to 1 mg/mL (72 μM in monomer units) and aliquoted into
Eppendorf tubes. The fibrils were then pelleted again, and the supernatant
was discarded before adding solutions of 8 M urea ±20 mM DTT.
After 1 h at room temperature, the samples were again centrifuged,
and 20 μL of each supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf
tube and mixed with reducing loading buffer (G Biosciences). Samples
were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C and run on SDS-PAGE together with
a Mark12 unstained protein marker (Thermo Scientific) and control
samples of 1 mg/mL (72 μM) freshly desalted FapC ΔR1R2R3
± 20 mM DTT and 1 mg/mL (42 μM) wild-type FapC fibrils
treated with 8 M urea ±20 mM DTT.

Results
Both FapC and
FapC ΔR1R2R3 Form ThT-Positive Amyloid Fibrils
But with Differences in Morphology
We started by comparing
the fibrillation properties of FapC and the repeat-less FapC mutant
(FapC ΔR1R2R3) using the amyloid-binding dye ThT. Both proteins
led to an increase in ThT fluorescence, but FapC ΔR1R2R3 showed
a reduction in ThT fluorescence by a factor of 3.4 ± 0.5, a much
longer lag phase and greater variation between individual runs (Figure 1A). The reduction
in ThT fluorescence could be caused by a lower fibrillation yield,
which in turn implies a larger population of soluble protein. To clarify
this, we separated the solutions into soluble and insoluble components
by centrifugation and estimated the amount of soluble protein by SDS-PAGE
followed by densitometry. All soluble proteins migrated as monomers
(data not shown). On the basis of triplicate measurements, 90 ±
5% of FapC fibrillated, but for FapC ΔR1R2R3, this was reduced
to 44 ± 4%, that is, a 2-fold reduction in yield, which nevertheless
is smaller than the 3.4-fold reduction in ThT fluorescence. Thus,
the reduction in ThT fluorescence must be ascribed to both reduction
in yield as well as change in the fibril structure, which affects
ThT fluorescence. Nevertheless, both variants gave rise to FTIR spectra
with a pronounced peak around 1620 cm–1 (Figure 1B). This is taken
to indicate an amyloid cross-β structure; the greater size and
higher order of the β-sheets in the amyloid fibrils shift the
frequencies to lower wavenumbers compared to conventional β-sheets
which absorb >1630 cm–1.64 The presence of fibrillar structures for both proteins was also
confirmed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1C). Fibrils formed from FapC
ΔR1R2R3 were generally smaller, thinner, and more fragmented
than the FapC fibrils, and this altered morphology may explain the
reduction in ThT fluorescence in Figure 1A.

Figure 1 Both FapC and FapC ΔR1R2R3 form ThT-positive
amyloid fibrils.

(black) and 1 mg/mL FapC ΔR1R2R3 (=72 μM) (orange). After
fibrillation, the fibrils were investigated with (B) FTIR and (C)
TEM. The scale bar is 100 nm.

Monomeric FapC Has High Affinity for Its Own Fibrils
To
investigate interactions between monomeric and fibrillary FapC,
we incubated Alexa 546-labelled FapC/FapC ΔR1R2R3 monomer as
a probe with membranes, on which we had immobilized both FapC and
FapC ΔR1R2R3 as bait in monomeric (M) and in fibrillar (F) forms.
To control the extent of bait binding, we stained the membranes with
Ponceau S prior to the analysis. Fibrils bound to a 2–4-fold
smaller extent than monomers, but both variants bound to essentially
the same extent (Figure S3). FapC monomers
bind preferentially to FapC fibrils, leaving very little to bind to
the FapC ΔR1R2R3 fibrils (Figure 2A, left). Monomeric FapC ΔR1R2R3 also preferably
binds its own fibrils but shows less overall binding than FapC (Figure 2A, right), nicely
consistent with FapC ΔR1R2R3’s lower aggregation tendency
(Figure 1A). We ascribe
the lack of binding to immobilized monomeric proteins to the much
higher affinity of the monomer toward the fibrils that are present
in the same binding reaction. In the absence of immobilized fibrils,
both labelled FapC/FapC ΔR1R2R3 monomers bind both types of
monomers (Figure 2B).

their own fibrils and recognize different species of α-SN. Dot

α-SN monomers, oligomers (O), and fibrils.

Both FapC and FapC ΔR1R2R3 Bind to All Species of Human
α-SN But Only FapC ΔR1R2R3 Inhibits α-SN Fibrillation
Because of the possible link between the human microbiome and PD
spreading and pathology, we speculated whether wild-type FapC and
FapC ΔR1R2R3 monomers recognize and interact with human α-SN.
CsgC/CsgH and EGCG inhibit fibrillation of both FapC and human α-SN,
indicating that FapC and α-SN share common structural features.27,29−32 We were unable to investigate interactions between the different
proteins by conventional biophysical approaches such as Biacore or
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry because of the relatively large quantities
of homogeneous sample needed as well as the rather weak binding interactions.
However, as a first step to investigate these possible interactions,
we immobilized both monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar α-SN
on membranes and exposed them to labelled, monomeric FapC/FapC ΔR1R2R3.
Remarkably, both FapC proteins could recognize all types of α-SN,
with no clear preference for one particular species (Figure 2C). This opened up the possibility
that they might also affect α-SN fibrillation. We therefore
incubated a constant amount (1 mg/mL or 70 μM) of α-SN
with 0–1 mg/mL (0–72 μM) FapC ΔR1R2R3. As
shown in Figure 3A,B,
α-SN/FapC ΔR1R2R3 ratios between 1:0.03 and 1:0.3 (in
ratios of mg/mL, essentially identical to molar ratios) increased
the lag time of α-SN fibrillation by 2–4-fold. The effect
diminished at higher FapC ΔR1R2R3 concentrations, which we interpret
as a preference for FapC–FapC interactions as opposed to FapC-α-SN
interactions. A substoichiometric optimum for inhibition is also consistent
with the ability of monomeric FapC to interact with aggregated species
of α-SN (Figure 2C). In contrast, FapC was not able to inhibit α-SN fibrillation;
rather, it slightly accelerated α-SN fibrillation in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figures 3C
and S4). Two other mutants of FapC, namely
FapC ΔR3 and FapC ΔR1R3 lacking one and two repeats, respectively,
fibrillated at rates very comparable to FapC and were also unable
to inhibit α-SN fibrillation (data not shown). This indicates
that FapC needs to be significantly impaired in its fibrillation to
inhibit α-SN fibrillation. In addition to monomeric FapC, we
also tested the effect of adding different amounts (0–0.35
mg/mL, i.e., 0–15/25 μM in monomeric units) of fibrillated
FapC and FapC ΔR1R2R3 to 1 mg/mL (70 μM) monomeric α-SN
but found no significant effect on aggregation (Figure 3), indicating that FapC ΔR1R2R3 needs
to be able to access the monomeric state to inhibit α-SN aggregation.

Data using monomeric FapC or FapC ΔR1R2R3 are from three individual
experiments I–III (each in triplicate). The average from these
three experiments is shown with a black line. Results from experiments
using fibrils of FapC or FapC ΔR1R2R3 instead of monomeric protein
are shown in green and indicate no significant effect.

Small Oligomers Are Formed When Incubating
α-SN with FapC
ΔR1R2R3
We reasoned that FapC ΔR1R2R3 could delay
α-SN fibrillation by trapping α-SN in a hetero-oligomeric
state. Therefore, we incubated 1:0.5 (mass/mass) α-SN and FapC
ΔR1R2R3 at 37 °C with agitation for ∼4 h before
running the samples on a size exclusion column to analyze the size
distribution of the ensuing aggregates. Coincubation leads to two
peaks at 12.23 and 14.40 mL (monomeric α-SN elutes at 17 mL)
(Figure 4A, red curve), and we will refer to the 12.23 mL peak
as the small oligomer peak. These two peaks are only slightly changed
compared to the two peaks formed around 12.42 and 14.15 mL by FapC
ΔR1R2R3 alone after 4 h of shaking (Figure 4A, light blue curve). Inspecting the elution
profile of the coincubation (red curve in Figure 4A), the α-SN monomer peak at 16.69
mL has not increased in intensity compared to that of FapC-free α-SN
(gray curve), although monomeric FapC ΔR1R2R3 elutes at 16.89
mL. It should, however, be noticed that the red 16.69 mL peak has
broadened compared to FapC-free α-SN, making it fair to assume
that protein is eluting both as monomeric α-SN and monomeric
FapC ΔR1R2R3. Even right after desalting, FapC ΔR1R2R3
does not exist exclusively as a monomer (Figure 4A, dark blue curve); in addition to the monomer
peak around 16.55 mL (close to the value of monomeric α-SN,
in good agreement with 124 and 140 residues for FapC ΔR1R2R3
and α-SN, respectively), there is a large peak around 14.86
mL. We speculated that this oligomerization could be due to disulfide
bond formation between cysteine residues in the C-terminal C112XXC115 motif of FapC ΔR1R2R3 (Figure S1). This was confirmed by incubating FapC ΔR1R2R3
with the reducing agent DTT, leading to loss of the 12 mL peak and
a strong reduction in the size of the 14 mL peak, that is, the protein
now eluted exclusively as a monomer at 17.34 mL with approximately
the same molecular weight as α-SN (Figure S5A, blue curve). When α-SN and FapC ΔR1R2R3 were
coincubated, DTT also inhibited the formation of small oligomers and
instead gave rise to an elution profile that was a combination of
monomeric α-SN and reduced, monomeric FapC ΔR1R2R3 (Figure S5B, light green curve). Incubation of
α-SN with FapC did not have any significant effect on oligomer
formation (Figure 4B, red curve) beyond a very small increase in the peak height and
a small shift to earlier elution volumes (from 10.67 to 10.51 mL).

Figure 4 FapC ΔR1R2R3
forms small, mixed oligomers with α-SN.
α-SN (4 mg/mL, 275 μM) and either (A) 2 mg/mL FapC ΔR1R2R3
(145 μM) or (B) 2 mg/mL FapC (85 μM) were run on SEC before
(no shaking) and after shaking (4.25 h, 37 °C, 700 rpm). α-SN
was run either alone or in a α-SN/FapC ΔR1R2R3 ratio of
1:0.5. Notice the difference in the UV280 nm of the zoomed
graphs. Numbers represent the precise elution volumes (in mL) obtained
from the Gaussian fitting to the elution profiles. (C) From the SEC
run with 1:0.5 α-SN/FapC ΔR1R2R3 after shaking, fractions
1–4 (zoom) were collected. (D) All four fractions were pooled,
up-concentrated and immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes together
with duplicates of 1 μg α-SN, 1 μg freshly desalted
FapC ΔR1R2R3, and 1× PBS and investigated with antibodies
against either α-SN (left) or FapC (right).

Small Oligomers Are Composed Primarily of FapC ΔR1R2R3
But Also Contain α-SN
To confirm the content of FapC
ΔR1R2R3 in the small oligomers, we concentrated the oligomer
fractions 1–4 between elution volumes 12.25 and 14.25 mL (Figure 4C) and immobilized
them on nitrocellulose membranes. Two identical membranes were produced
and probed with antibodies against either human α-SN or FapC.
Monomeric α-SN, freshly desalted FapC ΔR1R2R3, and PBS
were included as controls. These blots clearly showed that the small
oligomers contained high amounts of FapC ΔR1R2R3 but that α-SN
was also present as a minor component (Figure 4D), again indicating direct interaction between
FapC ΔR1R2R3 and α-SN. On the basis of the densitometric
analysis, we estimated the amount of FapC ΔR1R2R3 and α-SN
in the spot (fractions 1–4) to be 1.38 ± 0.02 and 0.41
± 0.06 μg, respectively, giving a FapC ΔR1R2R3/α-SN
mass ratio of 3.4:1 (Figure 4D). α-SN oligomers elute around 10.67 mL, indicating
that we have formed α-SN/FapC ΔR1R2R3 hetero-oligomers
(Figure 4B). That some
α-SN is eluting already between 12.25 and 14.25 mL as part of
these small oligomers is also consistent with the small decline in
the α-SN peak in the α-SN/FapC ΔR1R2R3 coincubation
SEC elution profile (Figure 4A, red and gray curves).

Ability of FapC ΔR1R2R3
To Inhibit α-SN Fibrillation
Depends on Disulfide Bond Formation
Finally, we investigated
if disulfide bond formation by FapC ΔR1R2R3 was essential for
its ability to inhibit human α-SN fibrillation. α-SN was
again incubated with different ratios of FapC ΔR1R2R3, and DTT
was included to inhibit disulfide bond formation. Reducing conditions
completely abolished the inhibitory effect (Figure 5A). In this figure, the red curve portraying
the fibrillation of the α-SN/FapC ΔR1R2R3 mixture contains
both a rapid rise and a slow descent (ca. 2–7 h) corresponding
to the behavior of free FapC ΔR1R2R3 (orange curve) and a subsequent
fibrillation (reaching a plateau around 10 h), which corresponds to
free α-SN. α-SN thus fibrillates even more rapidly in
the presence of reduced FapC ΔR1R2R3 than alone, that is, it
is not inhibited. Remarkably, the reduction of FapC ΔR1R2R3
also completely changed its fibrillation pattern, and now the protein
fibrillated extremely fast as opposed to its normal fibrillation behavior
(Figure 5B). This suggests
that the lack of imperfect repeats, leading to a longer fibrillation
lag phase, allows for disulfide bond formation and that these bonds
halt FapC ΔR1R2R3 in various dimers, trimers, or higher order
oligomers and thereby complicate fibrillation. The change in fibrillation
kinetics, however, affected neither the structure nor the stability
of the mature fibrils: FapC ΔR1R2R3 fibrils formed with or without
DTT give similar FTIR spectra (Fig S6A)
and dissolve to the same extent in 8 M urea ± DTT (Figure S6B, compare lanes 6–7 and lanes
10–11). Figure 6B demonstrates that removing all repeats from FapC significantly
affects the stability of the mature fibrils: wild-type FapC fibrils
are completely resistant toward 8 M urea ± DTT (lanes 14 + 15)
and require more harsh solvents such as formic acid to dissolve.20,65 Incubating FapC with DTT did not affect fibrillation (Figure 5B, inset). Consistent with
this, mutating away the CXXC motif in FapC from Pseudomonas
aeruginosa PAO1 does not affect fibrillation.12

the presence of DTT. (B) Effect of DTT on the fibrillation kinetics

Figure 6 Proposed mechanism for inhibition of α-SN fibrillation by
FapC ΔR1R2R3. For both α-SN (blue) and FapC ΔR1R2R3
(orange), monomers (spheres) can form oligomers that can be elongated
further to mature fibrils. Because of its long lag phase, FapC ΔR1R2R3
will start forming dimers, trimers, and oligomers with disulfide bond
linkages (yellow stars), and these species retard fibrillation of
FapC ΔR1R2R3 itself as well as α-SN.

Discussion
Imperfect repeats in the sequences of FA
proteins such as CsgA
and FapC are believed to be the main drivers of amyloid formation.
To investigate the importance of these repeats, we designed a mutant
of FapC where all three imperfect repeats were removed (FapC ΔR1R2R3)
and showed that this mutant protein was still able to form ThT-positive
fibrillar structures that showed amyloid-characteristic secondary
structure when investigated with FTIR. However, the fibrillation lag
phase was considerably longer for FapC ΔR1R2R3, the yield and
ThT-binding properties of this mutant’s fibrils were reduced
several fold compared to wild-type, and the fibrils were thinner,
shorter, and more fragmented when compared to fibrils formed by FapC.
This indicated a marked reduction in both quantity and quality of
fibrillation by the removal of these repeats. Both FapC and FapC ΔR1R2R3
have a C-terminal CXXC motif (which is conserved among pseudomonads)
(Figure S1), and it was recently shown
that these residues are not required for polymerization of FapC from P. aeruginosa PAO1, as replacement of the Cys residues
with Ser or Glu residues did not affect either the fibrillation rate,
extent, or fibril structure.12 The same
has been observed for a Cys-less mutant of FapC from the Pseudomonas strain UK4 (B.S.V., unpublished results).
In contrast, FapC ΔR1R2R3 fibrillation in the presence of the
reducing agent DTT was markedly accelerated, leading to a lag phase
reduction from ∼12 to <2 h, much more resembling the lag
phase seen for FapC. This indicates that disulfide bonds formed between
FapC ΔR1R2R3 molecules, favored by the extended lag phase, trap
FapC ΔR1R2R3 proteins in off-pathway structures, which in turn
inhibits fibrillation and leads to formation of less well-structured
aggregates with lower ThT fluorescence and thinner fibrils.

It has been suggested that the GI tract could be a possible initiation
site for PD pathogenesis because of the early appearance of α-SN
aggregates in GI tissues.44−46 One possibility is that this
is a response to the bacteria in our microbiome,56,66 many of which form FA that are structurally similar to α-SN
fibrils.67 To study possible interactions
between the FA protein FapC and α-SN, we incubated α-SN
with both FapC and the FapC ΔR1R2R3 mutant. Incubating human
α-SN with FapC ΔR1R2R3 revealed that certain ratios of
α-SN/FapC ΔR1R2R3 led to an almost 4-fold increase in
the α-SN fibrillation lag phase, whereas FapC had no effect
on α-SN fibrillation. This inhibiting effect of FapC ΔR1R2R3
was dependent on disulfide bond formation as the effect was lost when
we repeated the experiment with DTT present. We therefore propose
a mechanism wherein FapC ΔR1R2R3 molecules, because of its long
lag phase, can form dimers, trimers, and oligomers with disulfide
bond linkages. These disulfide-bonded species are then able to interact
with α-SN (probably in its oligomeric form because the inhibition
is optimal at substoichiometric ratios of α-SN/FapC ΔR1R2R3),
thereby inhibiting α-SN fibrillation (Figure 6). That α-SN fibril formation was not
entirely prevented, but just delayed, indicates that the α-SN
monomers are not irreversibly trapped by the disulfide-bonded FapC
ΔR1R2R3 oligomeric species but can rearrange to eventually form
fibrils. This could indicate some kind of transient contacts between
FapC ΔR1R2R3 and α-SN, similar to what has been suggested
in the inhibition of α-SN by CsgC.30 When α-SN was incubated with FapC ΔR1R2R3 and run on
a size exclusion column, we were able to isolate small oligomers containing
primarily FapC ΔR1R2R3 as well as α-SN. This indicates
that the two proteins interact directly because it appears that FapC
ΔR1R2R3 to some degree is able to complex α-SN, which
otherwise does not elute between 12.25 and 14.25 mL (Figure 4A,B). No increase in oligomer
formation was observed when human α-SN was incubated together
with FapC. We speculate that this is because the fast fibrillation
kinetics for FapC allows it to fibrillate independently of α-SN.
To summarize, the amyloidogenicity of FapC had to be reduced below
a certain level (which was only seen for the most amputated of the
FapC mutants: FapC ΔR1R2R3) to favor the interaction with and
inhibition of α-SN fibrillation. It is unlikely that this will
have any direct relevance for our understanding of the biological
role of FapC. Even though Pseudomonas is found in the gut, wild-type FapC aggregates very rapidly and
does not react directly with α-SN, according to our experiments,
so the FapC secreted from the bacterium will likely be integrated
into the growing fibrils well before it even encounters any free α-SN.
However, our data emphasize that cross-talk can depend on the rapidity
of the fibrillation process, so that retardation of fibrillation or
intermediate aggregate structures trapped under in vivo conditions
could in fact promote interactions with other fibrillating species.

The results presented here provides a new twist on the role of
31- and 30-residue long linkers in FapC from Pseudomonas strain UK4. In the current model of the mature Fap fibrils, the
imperfect repeats form the core of the fibrils while the linker regions
are exposed to the surrounding environment.22,23 However, since FapC ΔR1R2R3 is still capable of forming fibril
structures, some fibrillation information must be encoded within these
linkers. It remains to be investigated whether this is unique to UK4
FapC or if it is also true for FapC homologs from other pseudomonads.
Comparison of the linker sequences of different FapC proteins shows
that especially L2 is highly variable in size20 but that both L1 and L2 contain conserved asparagine, glutamine,
and alanine residues (Figure S7). Conservation
of these amino acids are also observed in the FapC repeat regions20 and in other amyloidogenic proteins such as
CsgA,17,68 prion,69 and
spider silk proteins70 and could partly
explain the amyloidogenicity of the linkers. A simple explanation
for the residual fibrillation propensity of FapC ΔR1R2R3 is
that the repeat sequences drive amyloid formation so strongly that
the linkers’ intrinsic fibrillation propensity lies dormant
and can only be manifested in the absence of these repeats.

Not only does the results presented here shed light on the FapC
fibrillation mechanism but they also emphasize how one fibrillating
protein may affect a completely different protein because the systems
share common fibril formation mechanisms. A different example of such
cross-interactions is the ability of the human amyloid precursor transthyretin
to inhibit unrelated proteins such as Aβ4071 and CsgA,72 suggesting
that the primary sequences and the species of origin of the proteins
are less important than the fibrillation mechanism itself. Coincubation
of different fibrillation proteins can also result in increased fibril formation as in the case of tau and the α-SN mutant
A53T (α-SNA53T) protein. Both proteins fibrillate
independently (even though tau requires the presence of cofactors
such as sulphated glycosaminoglycans73,74), but coincubation
of the two proteins results in increased formation of both α-SN
and tau inclusions.74 As both tau and α-SN
are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, studies such as this one
open up the possibility that therapeutic agents that effectively inhibit
one form of amyloid might also be effective in the treatment of other
neurological disorders.
