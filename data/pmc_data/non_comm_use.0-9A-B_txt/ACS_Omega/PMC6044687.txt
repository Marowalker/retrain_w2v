Analyzed
by a quantitative method based on diffuse reflectance
infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, pectins extracted from different
regions (outer skin, peel, and waste) of citrus fruits (red orange,
lemon, and grapefruit) via microwave-assisted hydrodiffusion show
significant variations. All polymers obtained are low-methoxyl pectins,
with high contents in galacturonic acid regions. The degree of esterification
(DE) of pectin extracted from different regions increases in the order
waste < peel < outer skin for red orange, inverting for lemon.
Thus, the pectins with the lowest DE are those extracted from red
orange waste and lemon outer skin (∼25%). These findings open
the route to nutraceutical- and pharmaceutical-grade pectins from
citrus, in which the source fruit and its regions may be chosen, according
to the desired DE.

1 Introduction
Industrially
obtained from lemon peel and, to a minor extent, from
apple pomace, via acid hydrolysis using aqueous hydrochloric acid,
nitric acid, or sulfuric acid at high temperature under controlled
conditions (pH, time, and temperature) to minimize deesterification
and depolymerization,1 heteropolysaccharide
pectin is a natural hydrocolloid currently found in multiple food,
cosmetic, beverage, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical products, in
which it exerts important functions, including gelation, fiber enrichment,
stabilization, and texture and rheology control.2 The chemical structure of pectin depends on the source,
location in the source, and extraction method. In general, the structure
is mostly composed of homopolymeric partially 6-methylated and 2-
and/or 3-acetylated poly-α(1–4)-d-galacturonic
acid residues (known as homogalacturonan, HG, regions), alternating
with branched α(1–2)-l-rhamnosyl-α(1–4)-d-galacturonosyl chains substituted with side chains of mainly
α-l-arabinofuranose and α-d-galactopyranose
(known as rhamnogalacturonan I, RG-I, regions).3 The relative proportions of interconnected HG and RG-I
regions, also called “smooth” (HG) and “hairy”
(RG-I) regions, respectively, determine the flexibility and rheological
properties of the polymer in solution: the HG regions enhance molecular
interactions, whereas the branched RG regions promote the formation
of entangled structures.4 On the other
hand, some of the carboxyl groups in the galacturonic acid residues,
both in the HG and RG regions, may be methyl-esterified or exist as
uronic acid salt, affecting the polymer charge in solution.5

Such structural features turn pectin into
an extremely versatile
polymer. With high molecular weights (80–400 kDa), pectins
are easily converted into hydrogels (HG domains are responsible for
the gelling capability, while RG-I regions play a gel-stabilizing
role), whose gelling mechanism is dictated by their degree of esterification
(DE, total methoxyl content): pectins with high DE tend to form gels
at low pH, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions,6 whereas those with low DE tend to form gels electrostatically
stabilized by metal cations.5 This gelling
behavior shows how important it is to consider simultaneously the
DE, the monosaccharide content (HG), and the spatial disposition of
the cross-linking blocks (RG) when designing pectin gels for specific
applications.7

Commercially, pectins
are classified according to their methoxyl
content and to the gel-forming rate. In detail, pectin commercial
grades with DE lower and higher than 50% are classified as low and
high methoxyl (LM and HM) pectins, respectively. Due to booming demand
facing saturated capacity of existing extraction plants relying on
conventional extraction process, the price of both LM and HM pectins
has more than doubled.8 Furthermore, pectin
is being increasingly demanded for nutraceutical applications due
to numerous health benefits,9 including
its ability to inhibit galectin-310 and
to lower cholesterol and glucose levels in blood, for which the European
Food Safety Authority recommends intake of 6 g of pectin per day.11 Indeed, pectin’s source, degree of esterification,
and molecular weight crucially affect its ability to lower cholesterol
levels in blood, leading scholars to conclude that authorities issuing
pectin cholesterol-lowering claim should require inclusion of DE and
molecular weight.12

Intensive research
efforts are being devoted across the world to
develop new commercial pectin sources and extraction techniques.13 In this context, we have lately shown how to
extract citrus pectin and essential oils from waste orange and lemon
peel in high yield by an ecofriendly process run entirely in water,
combining solvent-free microwave extraction and microwave hydrodiffusion
and gravity.14 Opposite to what happens
in a conventional hydrodistillation, during microwave extraction,
the heating of the biological matrix takes place outwardly, generally
affording high extraction yields at lower temperatures, which makes
the process well suited for valorization of fruit and agriculture
coproducts in terms of energy, elimination of solvents, and enhanced
yield.15 In 2013, for example, scholars
in India reported that optimized microwave-assisted extraction of
pectin from dried orange peel in water at pH 1.4 afforded a 19.24%
pectin yield.16 Excellent results with
waste orange peel microwave extraction have been reported by Clark’s
team already in 2012.17

We now report
the results of the extraction of pectin from different
(undried) citrus fruits and from different
fruit parts, namely, the outer skin (exocarp), the peel (exo- and
mesocarp), and the waste (exo-, meso-, and endocarp) of Sicily’s
red orange and lemon fruits, as well as the peel of grapefruit, all
collected between December and early January (i.e., the best picking
period of the year), using microwave-assisted hydrodiffusion.18 The pectins are analyzed by infrared spectroscopy
(in diffuse reflectance mode), leading to differentiate them in terms
of degree of esterification and relative content in smooth regions.
This work represents a proof of concept of the following: pectin with
the desired degree of esterification may be obtained just by a judicious
choice of the source (fruit and/or fruit part), the degree of esterification
being determined by a simple, experimentally straightforward, nondestructive,
and time-saving method (quantitative analysis of diffuse reflectance
infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra).

2 Results
and Discussion
Different fresh citrus fruits and fruit parts
were subjected to
microwave extraction in water using a laboratory-scale commercial
microwave extractor (see Experimental Section). After irradiating each sample at 600 W until the temperature reached
100 °C, the power was lowered to 500 W. The total time of irradiation
lasted between 60 and 80 min (Table 1), depending on the amount of each sample as well as
on its water content.

The 20 min difference between the shortest
and longest irradiation
times only depends on the time needed for optimal extraction under
500 W microwave irradiation. After a certain time, indeed, the matrix
sample being extracted suspended in hot water tends to turn brown
due to deep dehydration. A typical water extract obtained from waste
red orange peel, with the insoluble essential oil easily decanted,
is shown in Figure 1.19

All samples were extensively characterized
by DRIFT spectroscopy
(Figure 2). The complete assignments are included
in Table S1 of the Supporting information (SI). Given that the spectra are normalized to the νC–O–C
band of pyranose rings (at ∼1100 cm–1), the
relative intensities of the carboxylate-related bands change very
clearly, especially for pectin extracted from lemon, suggesting different
degrees of esterification.

as indicated. The spectra are normalized to the maximum of the pyranose
νC–O–C band, at ∼1100 cm–1.

The influence of the type of fruit
on the spectrum of pectin extracted
from equivalent regions is well expressed in Figure 3.

Figure 3 DRIFT spectra of pectin from equivalent regions
of different fruits,
as indicated.

Although the spectra
of pectin from the exocarp (outer skin) of
the different fruits are similar, those of pectin from the waste apparently
show different degrees of esterification, and those from the peel
(exo- and mesocarp) are completely different, suggesting also different
contents of galacturonic acid-rich (HG) regions.

The DE of pectin
has been determined by Monsoor et al. from the
DRIFT spectra, by correlating the ratio of ester carboxyl to total
carboxyl peak areas with the values obtained by gas chromatography.20 We have recently used a similar approach consisting
in determining DE directly from the ratio of band intensities of the
esterified carboxyl stretching components to the total band intensities
of the esterified plus nonesterified carboxylate groups, obtained
by spectral deconvolution.14 A detailed
spectral analysis was necessary. It implied the assignment of vibrational
components not directly observed in the region related to the carbonyl
and carboxylate stretching modes (1800–1500 cm–1): because the carbonyl groups may be involved in different hydrogen
bonds and therefore contribute with more than one component, the best
estimates for the νC=O and νasCOO– band areas were obtained by decomposing the whole
1900–900 cm–1 region into a sum of Gaussian
and Lorentzian components,21 using a nonlinear
least-squares fitting method. The detailed results of the deconvolutions
are included in Table S2 of the Supporting information (SI).

The DE values
were thus obtained by eq 1(14) 1  As to the amount of galacturonic acid-rich
(HG) regions of pectin, their values are not calculated, but they
are proportional to the ratio described by eq 2,14 also assessed from the quantitative analysis of the DRIFT spectra 2  The values obtained are summarized in Table 2.

Relative HG Content for Pectin Samples from Citrus Matrices Obtained

red orange waste	25	48	
lemon outer skin	24	37	
lemon

lemon waste	40	58

In general, the results summarized in Table 2 show that pectin
extracted from all of these
sources falls into the low methoxyl category (DE < 50%), namely,
pectins of high quality suitable as additives in the food industry,
especially in low-fat products. However, the DE depends on the source,
ranging from a minimum of 24% for pectin from lemon exocarp to a maximum
of 40% for pectin extracted from lemon waste (exo-, meso-, and endocarp).
The red orange (Citrus sinensis) and
grapefruit pectins show intermediate values of DE. Besides, the DE
increases from waste to outer skin in red orange pectin. This suggests that the pectin
from the red orange pulp must have a very low DE (in contrast to the
pectin of blond Valencia orange)22 and
a significant contribution.

In contrast, for lemon pectin, the
minimum DE was obtained for
the outer skin and the maximum for the waste. Interestingly, pectins
from the peel, independently of the fruit, have similar degrees of
esterification (∼30%). In summary, the fruit and its region
may be chosen as a source of pectin according to the intended DE or,
in other words, the pectin DE may be tuned by choosing the appropriate
source.

The relative scale in HG content enables only to conclude
that
pectins from lemon waste, red orange peel, and grapefruit peel are
the richest in galacturonic acid regions, whereas those from lemon
outer skin are the poorest. In general, a higher percentage of HG
regions in pectin from a certain fruit part can be explained by an
increased breaking of RG backbone units upon squeezing, leading to
a more aggregated structure. Apparently, the fruit pulps differ not
only in the DE but also in the HG percentage. Pectin extracted from
red orange waste combines low methoxyl content with high HG relative
content.

Finally, confirmation of the results obtained by the
present method
was achieved by application to commercial pectin samples, whose degrees
of esterification, provided by the manufacturers, nicely match those
determined in this work (Table 3). The spectra are shown in Figure S1 of the SI, and the deconvolution results
are detailed in Table S3 of the SI.

The minimum content in galacturonic acid regions was
provided only
for one commercial pectin (74%, for citrus pectin B). This is an indication
that all of the pectin samples extracted in this work contain very
high proportions of HG regions, which is a consequence of the low
molecular degradation associated with the extraction procedure. Thus,
the pectins extracted with microwaves only in neutral water from the
Sicily citrus fruits in December/January appear to be generally richer
in smooth regions than the commercial ones obtained via hydrolysis
in hot water.

3 Conclusions
Pectins
extracted with microwaves from outer skin, peel, and waste
of red orange, lemon, and grapefruit harvested in Sicily are low-methoxyl
pectins, in which the degree of esterification increases in the order
waste < peel < skin for red orange pectin, and inverts for lemon. The pectin extracted from lemon exocarp
has not only a minimum degree of esterification (DE) but also a minimum
content in smooth regions, whereas the pectin extracted from red orange
waste (exo-, meso-, and endocarp) combines low methoxyl content with
high HG content. The analytical method based on vibrational spectroscopy
has been applied to samples of commercial citrus pectins. Remarkably,
the results obtained with the new method are within the DE range reported
by pectin manufacturers. These findings may open the route to high-quality
nutraceutical- and pharmaceutical-grade citrus pectins obtained via
an intrinsically clean process, employing pure water as the only extraction
medium, in which the fruit and its region are chosen as a source of
pectin according to the intended DE. We are currently studying and
will shortly report the antioxidant and antimicrobial role imparted
to these new pectins by the soluble flavonoid biophenols contained
in the orange,23 lemon,24 and grapefruit25 exocarp. It
is also of relevance, in conclusion, that a similar versatility enabling
to selectively adjust the essential oil composition has been recently
reported also when microwave hydrodiffusion and gravity extraction
were applied to waste lemon peel carried out on semi-industrial scale.26

4 Experimental Section
Pectins were extracted from undried citrus fruit parts of lemon,
red orange, orange, and grapefruit using an NEOS microwave extractor
(Milestone, Italy). Red orange and lemon wastes were obtained either
by hand or by industrial squeezing (gift of Ortogel, Italy). The outer
skins and peels of the three fruits were obtained in the laboratory
by hand-cutting the fresh fruits. In a typical extraction, 500 g of
citrus fruit parts and 400 mL of distilled water were added to a glass
vessel. The vessel was inserted in the microwave oven of the NEOS
commercial extractor. Its door was closed and power was set at 600
W until the temperature reached 100 °C, after which power was
lowered to 500 W. The total time of irradiation lasted between 60
and 80 min (Table 1), depending on the amount of each sample as well as its water content.
Before observing any browning, irradiation was switched off and the
sample was allowed to cool down.

Pectin obtained via freeze
drying as a pale orange or slightly
yellow powder, respectively, from red orange or lemon and grapefruit
matrices had a delicate and pleasant smell. The structure of said
powders was assessed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
in diffuse reflectance mode (DRIFT), using a Mattson FTIR spectrometer
with a Specac Selector, in the range of 4000–400 cm–1 (wide-band MCT detector), at 2 cm–1 resolution.
The sample preparation consisted simply in grinding the sample and
mixing with ground KBr in the appropriate proportion to assure the
validity of the Kubelka–Munk assumptions.27 The spectra were the result of ratioing 1000 added scans
for each sample against the same number of scans for the background
(ground KBr).
