Zinc
oxide (ZnO) based ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors have been
fabricated and their photoresponse is studied in Schottky diode configuration.
A cost-effective single-step electrochemical deposition method is
adopted for the growth of ZnO film with nanorod (NR) and nanoflake
morphology. A comparative study of the photodetection parameters based
on surface trap states, crystallinity, and strain is done for two
different morphology films. Significant photocurrent enhancement is
observed for the nanorods under UV light, with appreciable photoresponse
in the blue region. A template-assisted growth of ZnO NR film is proposed
for better photoresponse and sensitivity of the device, useful for
various optoelectronic applications.

Introduction
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is inherently an n-type
semiconductor with a direct
band gap of ∼3.37 eV and a large exciton binding energy of
∼60 meV at room temperature.1 Due
to a hexagonal wurtzite2 crystal structure
and a noncentro symmetry3 of the oxygen
atom in a tetrahedral coordination geometry, zinc oxide shows interesting
physical and chemical properties. Over the past decade, one-dimensional
(1D) nanostructures of ZnO have emerged as a subject of intensive
study.3 Due to an increase in the density
of trap states at the surface and a large surface-to-volume ratio
with a reduction in dimension, ZnO 1D nanostructures have been extensively
used for various electronic, optoelectronic, electromechanical, and
electrochemical applications.4,5 Devices such as light-emitting
diode,6,7 laser diode,8 photovoltaic cell,9 piezoelectric transducers,10−13 gas sensors,14,15 and so on have been realized
and can be potentially applied in military, food sector, space technology,
pollution control, commercial products, and many more.16

ZnO 1D nanostructures can be grown by
several methods such as chemical
vapor deposition,17 pulsed laser deposition,18 hydrothermal synthesis,3,19,20 electrochemical deposition (ECD),21,22 and so on. Compared with other synthesis methods, ECD is more advantageous,
as it does not require high vacuum, high pressure and can be operated
at lower temperatures. As a result, inexpensive transparent conductive
films and plastic can be used as substrates for deposition. Izaki
et al.23 and Peulon et al.24 reported ECD of ZnO on a transparent conducting glass substrate,
with its major application in optoelectronics. ZnO 1D nanostructures
in various device configurations such as metal insulator semiconductor,25,26 n–p junction,27 Schottky diode,28−30 and so on have been reported depending on its applications. Among
these, metal-semiconductor
rectifying behavior in a Schottky diode configuration is advantageous
for photodetection, as it requires a low bias and has a high sensitivity
with a low dark current.31 Photodetectors
are basically transducers whose one of the characteristic properties
changes when illuminated with light. As a photodetector, ZnO is extensively
used for UV detection. A change in conductivity upon illumination
is measured for the detection that is mainly due to the depletion
region formed by the adsorption and diminished by the desorption of
oxygen ions on the surface of nanostructure.32,33 Various 1D nanostructures such as nanowires,34 nanobelts,35 and nanorods (NRs)36 have been exclusively studied in this regard.
An efficient photodetector should have a high sensitivity, high speed,
high spectral selectivity, high stability, and better signal-to-noise
ratio. The photosensitivity and speed of the detector depends on the
lifetime of charge carrier and the transit time, respectively. The
presence of defects in photodetector material determines the spectral
selectivity and stability of the device.37 A higher magnitude of the measured quantity is desirable to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio. In ZnO 1D nanostructures, surface defects
prolong the carrier lifetime and the reduced dimensionality shortens
the transit time. Most of the study for photodetection with ZnO is
pertaining to in-plane-fabricated devices. However, devices with vertically
grown nanostructures become very important as the surface phenomenon
is dominant in the UV detection. The out-of-plane growth offers a
large enhancement and an illumination from the back provides a large
active area for sensing applications. Also, the study of photodetector
characteristics due to plasmonics from metal nanoparticles decorated
on vertically aligned nanorods is still emerging.38,39 Thus, it is very important to have a comparative study of the photodetector
characteristics from several vertically grown nanostructures of ZnO.

The present work is a comparative study of the photoresponse for
two different morphology samples that are out-of plane grown ZnO films
under metal–semiconductor Schottky diode configuration. A single-step
electrochemical deposition is adopted for the nanostructured growth
of ZnO film on a transparent conducting glass substrate. The electrolyte
composition and ion concentration are varied for vertical growth of
different nanostructures. Influence of the varied structural growth
on the spectral photoresponse and sensitivity due to light propagation
along the thickness of the film is studied in detail.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of samples A and AE surfaces
along with the cross section and their corresponding I–V characteristics under dark and UV illumination.
A film of densely packed nanoflakes with a thickness of ∼2.5
μm is observed for sample A, as shown in Figure 1a. Cross-sectional image in the top-left
inset also shows the formation of a nanorod prior to the growth of
nanoflakes. From the bottom-left inset, it is observed that the void
region has a nanorod growth. During the initial deposition of ZnO,
the growth along the c-axis is favored relative to
other axes leading to the formation of nanorods. This is due to the
net dipole moment induced along the c-axis from an
alternate growth of Zn2+ and O2– terminated
polar faces on randomly oriented nuclei.40,41 Further deposition leads to the supersaturation of OH– ion occupancy along the c-axis, allowing random
occupancy of these ions along other crystallographic axes.42 The competition for growth along the multiple
lattice planes suppresses the in-plane growth, leading to the formation
of nanoflakes.

AE with
their corresponding I–V characteristics.

inset shows the cross-sectional image for the initial growth of NR.
Bottom-left inset shows the NRs with a hexagonal facet. (c, d) I–V characteristics of samples A
and AE under dark and UV (365 nm) illumination, respectively.

Figure 1b shows
the SEM image of sample AE surface. Sample AE is prepared by etching
sample A, which does a partial removal of nanoflakes. Compared with Figure 1a, the density of
nanoflakes in Figure 1b is effectively reduced. The cross-sectional image in the top-left
inset shows the initial growth of NRs beneath the nanoflakes. The
thickness of sample AE is similar to that of sample A, and ZnO NRs
with perfect hexagonal facets are revealed as shown in bottom-left
inset. This further strengthens the concept of nanoflake growth under
the supersaturated hydroxyl ion occupancy of Zn2+ sites. Figure 1c,d shows the I–V characteristics under dark and
UV illumination of samples A and AE, respectively. Typical Schottky
diode characteristics are observed for both samples under dark (black)
and UV illumination (red). At 1 V of applied bias, the magnitude of
dark current increased approximately by threefold for sample AE compared
with that for sample A. This increase in dark current after etching
is attributed to a change in the surface morphology. It is observed
from Figure 1a,b that
the density of nanoflakes on sample A is large compared with that
on sample AE. This increases the density of deep-level defects present
in nanoflakes,43 acting as trap centers
for charge carriers. As a result, lower dark current is observed in
sample A compared with sample AE (see Figure 1c,d (black curve)). Significant photoresponse
under UV illumination is observed for samples A and AE as shown in Figure 1c,d (red curve).
Exposure to UV light with the photon energy higher than the band gap
of ZnO generates the electron–hole pairs.32 Photogenerated holes move toward the surface of nanostructure
and discharge adsorbed oxygen ions. With the extinction of depletion
layer, the conduction region increases and the photogenerated unpaired
electrons contribute to a quick rise in current. From Figure 1c,d (red curve), it is observed
that on-current under UV illumination at 1 V increased by 9 times
for sample AE compared with that for sample A. Hence, it is desirous
to have less number of nanoflakes for a high magnitude of photocurrent.
As the growth of nanoflakes is due to the supersaturation of hydroxyl
ion occupancy on Zn2+ terminated polar faces, the suppression
of these OH– ions leads to the growth of nanorods.
Also, doping of metal ions increases the conductivity and wide spectral
photoresponse. For this purpose, gold salt is added during ECD. Figure 2 shows the SEM images
along with the cross section and corresponding I–V characteristics of samples B and BE prepared by adding
gold salt in the electrolyte during ECD. A film of vertically grown
high-density NRs along with very few nanoflakes is observed in the
SEM image of sample B as shown in Figure 2a with a thickness ∼1.3 μm.
The top-left inset shows the cross-sectional image of vertically grown
NRs. No trace of gold is found in sample B as verified from the EDS
data shown in the bottom-left inset in Figure 2a. The near-total reduction in the density
of nanoflakes by the addition of HAuCl4 salt is due to
the suppression of OH– ion by H+ ions
in the electrolyte. This constraint favors the growth only along the c-axis and forms ZnO nanorods.

SEM images of samples B and BE with
their corresponding I–V characteristics.

inset shows the cross-sectional image of sample BE and bottom-left
inset shows zoomed in image of NRs. (c, d) V characteristics
of samples B and BE under dark and UV (365 nm) illumination.

Figure 2b shows
the SEM image of sample BE prepared by etching sample B. A compact
film of NRs with the total absence of nanoflakes is observed in sample
BE with thickness ∼1 μm. Etching completely removes the
nanoflakes and makes thin-film surface uniform. The cross-sectional
image in the top-left inset in Figure 2b shows the compact vertical growth of NRs. The magnified
image shown in the bottom-left inset in Figure 2b depicts the hexagonal growth of NRs with
small pits on its surface introduced by etching process. The I–V characteristics of samples B
and BE under dark and UV illumination are shown in Figure 2c,d, respectively. A low dark
current is observed in sample B compared with sample BE due to the
presence of nanoflakes. This is analogous to the dark current behavior
observed in samples A and AE (see Figure 1c,d). With a decrease in the density of nanoflakes
from samples A to BE, the current behavior changes from Schottky to
semiconductor characteristics. For samples B and BE, dark current
at 1 V is in tens of milliampere, compared with samples A and AE.
Under UV illumination, the photoresponse is observed for both samples
B and BE, with tens of milliampere current difference between excited
and dark current. Increased surface trap states in NRs prolongs the
photocarrier lifetime; as a result, a higher photoresponse is observed
for samples B and BE compared with sample A and AE.33 Further increase in the concentrations of gold salt, above
0.5 mM in electrolyte, has reverted back the growth of nanoflakes
and deposition of Au all over the surface. This could be due to a
increase in Cl– ion concentration, which effectively
suppresses the growth along the c-axis.41

To study the effect of grown structures
on photoconductivity and
sensitivity, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV–vis absorbance
spectroscopy are carried out. Figure 3 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns and the absorbance
spectra of all of the samples. The 2θ scan from the XRD data
reveals the diffraction peaks for ⟨100⟩, ⟨002⟩,
and ⟨101⟩ plane, which is in accordance with those of
ZnO hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS (36–1451)). Peaks marked
with sign (*) corresponds to indium tin oxide (ITO). The intensity
of ⟨002⟩ is high compared with that of ⟨100⟩
and ⟨101⟩ peaks for all of the samples (see Figure 3a). This suggests
a preferential growth along the c-axis. Using prominent
diffraction peaks (⟨100⟩, ⟨002⟩, ⟨101⟩,
⟨102⟩, ⟨110⟩, ⟨103⟩, ⟨112⟩,
and ⟨203⟩) of the XRD data, the crystal grain size (t) and lattice strain (ε) for individual samples are
calculated from the Williamson–Hall plot.44t and ε is extracted from the y-intercept and the slope by linear fit to the data, β cos θ
= Aλ/t + 4ε sin θ,
where θ is the Bragg diffraction angle, β is the full
width at half-maximum (FWHM), λ is the X-ray wavelength, and A is a constant ∼0.94.44 From the analysis, the crystal grain size for all of the samples
A, AE, B, and BE varies from 15 to 20 nm, whereas the lattice strain
(ε) decreases from sample A to sample BE, as shown in Table 1. This is attributed
to a change in the film morphology from nanoflake to nanorod. The
broadening of ⟨002⟩ peak and the presence of other prominent
diffraction peaks depict the polycrystalline nature of ZnO nanostructures.
Compared with other samples, the high-intensity and low FWHM (β)
of ⟨002⟩ peak in the XRD data of sample BE suggest an
improved crystallinity in NRs. Figure 3c shows the UV–vis absorbance spectra of all
of the samples. A wide absorption band, with a prominent peak at ∼320
nm, is observed for all of the samples. The optical band gap was calculated
from Tauc plot of the absorbance data given by αhυ = A(hυ – Eg)n, where α
is the absorption coefficient, hυ is the photon
energy, A is a constant, Eg is the band gap, and n is the nature of transition
with values 1/2, 2, 3/2, and 3 for direct allowed, indirect allowed,
direct forbidden, and indirect forbidden transitions, respectively.
As ZnO is a direct band gap, the n value is taken
as 1/2.45Figure 3d shows the Tauc plot for the absorption
spectrum of sample BE. The band gap as measured from the intercept
on the x-axis for αhυ
= 0 is 3.76 eV. The calculated value of the band gap for all of the
samples from Tauc plot is given in Table 1. This increase in the band gap is attributed
to the polycrystalline nature of ZnO thin films.45

Figure 4 shows the
time-dependent photoresponse of ZnO nanostructure-based photodetectors
under dark and UV–vis illumination. In dark, low current is
observed for all of the samples and was allowed to saturate for initial
200 s as shown in Figure 4a,b. This is due to the adsorption of oxygen molecules and
the redistribution of charge carriers that form a space-charge region
along the surface of the nanostructure. On the other hand, when the
device is illuminated with UV light, an increase in current is observed
for all of the samples (see Figure 4a,b). The increase in current is due to increased conduction
with desorption of oxygen ions by photogenerated holes and extra charge
carriers in terms of unpaired electrons. A slow rise in the excited
current is observed for samples A and AE, compared with sample B and
BE, respectively, as shown in Figure 4a,b. This slow response is attributed to the large
surface area of the nanoflakes as observed from the SEM data and an
increase in the strain as calculated from the XRD data. This increases
the depletion region and the density of the deep-level defects.43 As a result, the gradual accumulation of unpaired
electrons by desorption of oxygen under UV light takes place, giving
rise to a slow response. On the other hand, a faster response time
for samples B and BE is due to the reduced density of the nanoflakes.
Among all of the samples, BE has the least rise time of 55 s, as it
is completely devoid of nanoflakes (see Figure 2b). The decay time and rise time of photocurrent
were calculated by considering 63% raise from the dark current and
37% fall from the maximum excited photocurrent (see Table 1).

AE and B, BE under UV (365 nm) illumination, respectively. (c) Enhancement
and sensitivity parameter plot of fabricated photodetector with device
schematic. (d) Blue filter photoresponse of samples B and BE.

Two regimes are observed in the
decay response from all of the
samples. An initial steep fall in the decay component upon switching
off of UV light arises from the fast carrier thermalization, hole-trapping
by surface states, and electron–hole recombination. The second
regime of decay response is due to the gradual capturing of the electrons
by adsorbing O2 molecules as shown in Figure 4a,b. Samples A and AE have
fast decay response compared with samples B and BE. This is due to
the high density of the deep-level defects, present in the nanoflakes,
that act as trap centers for the charge carrier. On the other hand,
a large decay time for samples B and BE is attributed to a slow diffusion
of O2 molecule with an increase in the compact nature of
the film. Figure 4c
shows the enhancement factor and the sensitivity plot of fabricated
photodetectors. The enhancement factor of the photodetector is calculated
by (IUVmax – IDark) and sensitivity by ((IUVmax – IDark)/IDark). The devices made of sample A have low enhancement compared
with those made from sample AE, and similar trend is observed for
sample B with respect to sample BE. This is due to an increase in
the density of less-conducting nanoflakes compared with high-conducting
NRs. In sample BE, wherein a compact and smooth film of NRs is present,
the enhancement is maximum. Due to a large dark current, the sensitivity
of samples B and BE is less compared with that of samples A and AE.
On the other hand, the enhancement of sample BE is significant. Thus,
sample BE can be applied where a large signal-to-noise ratio is desirable.
A low dark current in sample A offers high sensitivity for easy detection.
Sample AE has appreciable sensitivity and enhancement.

As the
photoresponse of the device is spread over a wide UV spectral
range and near visible region as observed from UV–vis spectrum
(see Figure 3c), the
response in the blue region using a blue filter is verified. An appreciable
enhancement in the photocurrent is observed for samples B and BE using
the blue filter as shown in Figure 4d. However, no such response was recorded with other
color filters. The response in the blue light is attributed to the
desorption of oxygen ions by the direct bombardment with incident
light photons through energy transfer.46

As discussed, vertically aligned growth architecture with
a high-density
nanorod film gives a large enhancement in the photoresponse as a large
surface area is available for UV exposure, but at a cost of high dark
current. However, nanoflake film shows high sensitivity due to low
dark current but low enhancement due to deep-level scattering centers.
Also, the prepared films have a high density of nanostructures, which
may not allow complete exposure of the surface area for oxygen adsorption.
As a result, the sensitivity and response time of the device is affected
due to the reduction in the surface coverage and a slow diffusion
of oxygen molecule. With a high signal-to-noise ratio as an advantage
in fabricated photodetector for sample BE, the sensitivity and response
time can be improved by well-separated growth of ZnO NRs. Use of template
allows the growth of an array of individual nanostructure, which will
provide the maximum surface area exposed for efficient adsorption
of oxygen molecules and less trap centers due to reduction in the
grain boundaries. Hence, photodetectors with high sensitivity and
large enhancement can be obtained by having well-separated vertically
aligned growth of nanorods.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a comparative
study of the photodetector characteristics
based on the surface trap states, crystallinity, and strain is done
for vertically grown ZnO films of nanoflakes and nanorods prepared
by electrochemical deposition. The influence of hydroxyl ion concentration
on the growth mode and its effect on the photodiode characteristics
is discussed. It was found that ZnO nanorod films are suitable for
a large enhancement in the signal for the UV detection and ZnO nanoflakes
for a high sensitivity. Well-separated growth of ZnO nanorods is proposed
to increase the surface area and reduce the charge carrier loss for
a fast response and a high sensitivity.

Experimental Section
For the electrochemical deposition of ZnO film, a glass substrate
coated with ∼125 nm of indium tin oxide (ITO) and resistivity
∼15–20 Ω cm is used as a cathode and platinum
(Pt) as an anode. Sample A is prepared by ECD in the aqueous solutions
of 10 mM zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO3)2·6H2O] and 0.1 M potassium chloride [KCl] for 1 h at constant
voltage of 1 V and temperature of 80 °C. Sample AE is prepared
by etching sample A with Pt as the counterelectrode in a solution
of 5 mM zinc chloride [ZnCl2] and 0.1 M KCl under a constant
reverse bias of 1.1 V at 85 °C for 3 h. Sample B was prepared
by same method as sample A, except for the addition of 0.1 mM gold
salt [HAuCl4·3H2O] in deionized water to
the electrolyte in 1:10 (v/v) ratio. Sample BE was formed by etching
sample B, similar to the conditions used for the preparation of sample
AE. All of the samples were annealed at 300 °C in an inert atmosphere
for 3 h.

Field-emission scanning electron microscope (Zeiss,
Auriga) is
used for the morphological observations of the sample surfaces. The
crystalline nature of the grown film is characterized by a high-resolution
X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) (PANalytical X’Pert PRO MRD System)
using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).
Optical properties of all of the ZnO films (samples A, AE and B, BE)
were measured using Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer.
Photodetectors in diode configuration were fabricated using ITO of
the sample substrate as an electrode for through exposure of light
and silver film of thickness ∼500 nm with area 4 × 4 mm2 on the sample as the counterelectrode. Current–voltage
(I–V) measurements were performed
by the source-measuring instrument (Keithley model-2612A) using the
labview program. Fabricated photodetectors were put in a dark box
and voltage is swept from −1 to 1 V with an increment of 50
mV. For a particular voltage, the current value is averaged over five
data points. Time-dependent photoresponse was measured for all of
the samples at a constant bias of 1 V in UV (365 nm) illumination
with a power density of 97 ± 3 μw cm–2 and the visible region using appropriate color filters.
