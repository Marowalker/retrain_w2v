We demonstrate controlled fabrication
of porous Si (PS) and vertically aligned silicon nanowires array starting
from bulk silicon wafer by simple chemical etching method, and the
underlying mechanism of nanostructure formation is presented. Silicon-oxidation
rate and the electron-scavenging rate from metal catalysis play a
vital role in determining the morphology of Si nanostructures. The
size of Ag catalyst is found to influence the Si oxidation rate. Tunable
morphologies from irregular porous to regular nanowire structure could
be tailored by controlling the size of Ag nanoparticles and H2O2 concentration. Ag nanoparticles of size around
30 nm resulted in irregular porous structures, whereas discontinuous
Ag film yielded nanowire structures. The depth of the porous Si structures
and the aspect ratio of Si nanowires depend on H2O2 concentration. For a fixed etching time, the depth of the
porous structures increases on increasing the H2O2 concentration. By varying the H2O2 concentration,
the surface porosity and aspect ratio of the nanowires were controlled.
Controlling the Ag catalyst size critically affects the morphology
of the etched Si nanostructures. H2O2 concentration
decides the degree of porosity of porous silicon, dimensions and surface
porosity of silicon nanowires, and etch depth. The mechanisms of the
size- and H2O2-concentration-dependent dissociation
of Ag and the formation of porous silicon and silicon nanowire are
described in detail.

Introduction
Silicon nanostructures
have attracted a great deal of attention
and interest because of their potential applications in various fields,
such as nanoelectronics,1−6 optoelectronics,7,8 energy storage,9−11 and energy
conversion12−15 and in biological and chemical sensors.16−19 Nanostructures such as porous
Si (PS), Si nanowires (SiNWs), nanograss, nanocrystals, and quantum
dots are some of them.20 Out of these nanostructures,
porous Si (PS) and Si nanowires (SiNWs) are widely studied and used
in numerous applications. PS has been mostly excavated for its luminescent
property21,22 and also as sensors.23,24 SiNWs have been mostly applied as chemical or biological sensors,16−19 solar cells,12−15,25,26 and anode for batteries.9−11 In addition, it has been demonstrated
that SiNWs can serve as effective photocatalysts for the photocatalytic
degradation of organic dyes and toxic pollutants.27,28 Controllable fabrication of Si nanostructures is therefore a prerequisite
for various applications. Depending on the type of application, the
use of nanostructures differs. For certain applications, highly porous
Si is used and for certain other applications, nanowires are used.
For example, porous Si is widely used in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization29,30 and optical sensing applications,31,32 whereas nanowire
morphology is widely used in gas-sensing applications.16−19 So far, a number of methods have been developed to fabricate Si
nanostructures using top-down or bottom-up approaches, such as vapor–liquid–solid
(VLS)33,34 growth, reactive-ion etching (RIE),35,36 electrochemical etching,37,38 and metal-assisted
chemical etching (MACE),39,40 all of which aim to
control various parameters of the Si structures. VLS and RIE methods
need sophisticated instruments and toxic gases. Therefore, a simple,
well-controlled, cost-effective method to fabricate Si nanostructures
is necessary. Among these methods, metal-assisted chemical etching
(MACE) has attracted increasing attention in recent years because
of its simplicity and low cost for fabricating various Si nanostructures.1 The nanostructures fabricated by MACE have demonstrated
their potential application in various fields, such as photovoltaics,12−15 energy storage,9−11 thermal power conversion,41 chemical and biological sensing,16−19 and biomimic superhydrophobicity.42,43

Fabrication of SiNWs and PS has been reported separately. However,
deep understanding relating the combined effect of metal catalyst
size and H2O2 concentration and its mechanism
of formation is still lacking. This work gives a new understanding
on the combined effect of size of metal catalyst and the H2O2 concentration to result in precise control over the
etched nanostructures. This work brings into light one simple method
for the controlled fabrication of porous Si and Si nanowires. Morphology
was controlled by controlling the concentration of the AgNO3, Ag deposition time, and the concentration of H2O2. Controlled fabrication thereby results in different morphology
with one simple cost-effective technique that can be used for different
applications. Evolution of nanostructures with respect to different
experimental parameters and its possible mechanism are discussed in
detail.

Results and Discussion
Effect of AgNO3 Concentration
Field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of Ag deposited over Si
for 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min with 0.0017 M AgNO3/4.8 M HF are shown in Figure 1a–e, respectively. FESEM images of Ag deposited over
Si for 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min with 0.005 M AgNO3/4.8 M HF are shown in Figure 1f–j, respectively. From Figure 1, it is evident that the Ag particle size
grows from 30 to 200 nm as the deposition time increases for 0.0017
M AgNO3 concentration. For 0.005 M AgNO3 concentration,
the Ag particle size grows from 50 nm until it percolates and forms
discontinuous film/network structure for 5 min Ag deposition. From
these observations, it can be concluded that for lower concentration
of AgNO3 (0.0017 M), the Ag particle starts growing slowly
with initial small size. As the deposition time increases, there is
increase in particle size from 30 to 200 nm. For higher AgNO3 concentration (0.005 M), in case of 15 s Ag deposition, the particle
size deposited is larger than that of the 15 s Ag deposition with
0.0017 M AgNO3 concentration. Because the concentration
of Ag ions is higher, the deposition rate is also higher. As the particle
grows with time, the particles coalesce to percolate the whole substrate
surface and form a discontinuous film, which can be seen in Figure 1j.

Figure 1 FESEM images of Ag deposited
over Si for 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min,
and 5 min with 0.0017 M AgNO3 (a–e) and with 0.005
M AgNO3 (f–j).

Effect of Ag Particle Size on Si Etching
FESEM images
of etched samples of the Ag deposited over Si for 15 s, 30 s, 1 min,
2 min, and 5 min with 0.0017 M AgNO3 concentration are
shown in Figure S1 (see the Supporting
Information). From the scanning electron microscopy images, we could
notice that for 15 s Ag deposition time, the Ag particles deposited
is ∼30 nm, and during etching in HF/H2O2 solution, these particles tend to etch the wafer in a random manner.2 Increasing the size of Ag particles reduces the
randomness in the etching. This will be explained in detail in the
following sections. FESEM images of etched samples of the Ag deposited
over Si for 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min with 0.005 M AgNO3 concentration are shown in Figure S2 (see the Supporting Information). In this case, random pores are
observed for 15 and 30 s Ag depositions. These random pores get reduced
and a definite vertical etching results for 2 and 5 min Ag depositions,
thus forming a nanowire-like morphology. This can be confirmed from
the cross-section FESEM images given in the following sections.

Effect of H2O2 Concentration
Effect
of H2O2 on the porosity, roughness,
depth of etching, and SiNW formation is studied by varying the concentration
of H2O2 from 0.05 to 0.3 M. Figure 2a–d shows the top-view
FESEM images of the Si etched in 0.05 M H2O2/4.8 M HF solution of 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min Ag-deposited
Si, respectively. Figure 2e–h shows the corresponding cross-section FESEM images. Figure 2 reveals that 30
s Ag-deposited Si yields highly random porous structure after etching.
The depth of the pores was found to be 4–5 μm. Because
the Ag particles deposited on the Si are small and isolated, they
form a highly random porous structure. As the Ag deposition time increases,
the etching becomes directional.

Figure 2 (a–d) Top-view FESEM images of
the Si etched in 0.05 M H2O2/4.8 M HF solution
of 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and
5 min Ag-deposited Si (with 0.005 M AgNO3). (e–h)
The respective cross-section views.

For 1 min Ag-deposited Si, the etching is directional with
distorted
walls. Ag particles in 1 min Ag-deposited Si are larger than those
in 30 s Ag-deposited Si, which could manage to form vertical downward
etching to compete the etching in all other directions. However, the
size of the Ag is still smaller and the Ag particles get separated
from the mother Ag particle and participate in etching horizontally,
which is the reason for the distortion in the wall of the vertical
etched structures. In 2 and 5 min Ag-deposited samples, regular vertical
etching was observed. The depth of the SiNWs was found to be 5–10
μm. For smaller Ag, the etch rate is low. From Figure 3, it is observed that for 30
s Ag-deposited Si, the etching is very porous as evident from the
top-view FESEM images. The average depth of the pores was found to
be 9 μm. As the concentration of H2O2 is
increased, the porosity as well as the depth of the random pores increases.
For 1 min Ag-deposited sample, the randomness of pores decreases compared
to 30 s Ag-deposited Si. The 2 and 5 min Ag-deposited Si form a well-aligned
vertical nonporous nanowire structure. Figure 4a–d shows the top-view
FESEM images of the Si etched in 0.3 M H2O2/4.8
M HF solution of 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min Ag-deposited Si. Figure 4e–h shows
the respective cross-section FESEM images.

Figure 3 (a–d) Top-view
FESEM images of the Si etched in 0.1 M H2O2/4.8
M HF solution for 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and
5 min Ag-deposited Si. (e–h) The respective cross-section FESEM
images.

Figure 4 (a–d) Top-view FESEM images of the Si
etched in 0.3 M H2O2/4.8 M HF solution of 30
s, 1 min, 2 min, and
5 min Ag-deposited Si (with 0.005 M AgNO3). (e–h)
The respective cross-section views.

From Figure 4, it
is observed that, for 30 s Ag-deposited Si, the etching is very porous,
as evident from the top-view FESEM images. The depth of the pores
was found to be 17 μm. As the concentration of H2O2 is increased, the porosity as well as the depth of
the random pores increases as compared to 0.1 M H2O2. For 1 min Ag-deposited sample, the randomness of pores increases
compared to 1 min Ag-deposited Si etched in 0.1 M H2O2. The 2 min Ag-deposited samples are also found have very
porous structures with distorted pores in the walls. In case of 5
min Ag-deposited Si after etching in 0.3 M H2O2, the nanowire thickness is found to be low and the nanowires are
found to be bundled at the top.

Figure S3 (see the Supporting Information)
shows the top view and 45° tilt view of a high-magnification
FESEM image of Si etched in 0.6 M H2O2/4.8 M
HF solution of 5 min Ag-deposited Si (with 0.005 M AgNO3). Nanowires are bundled at the top. Also the thickness of the wires
is low compared to that of the wires formed in 0.3 M H2O2/4.8 M HF solution (Figure 4d,h).

The thickness and porosity of
the nanowire surface depend on the
concentration of H2O2; for higher concentration,
the surface is highly porous, and porosity decreases as the concentration
is reduced. Figure 5 shows the HRTEM images of the nanowires prepared at lower (0.05
M) and higher (0.6 M) H2O2 concentrations. The
thickness of the porous layer surface increases as the H2O2 concentration is increased. When the H2O2 concentration is high, the conversion rate of Ag+ to Ag is high and hence it energetically favors more Ag nucleation
on the walls, thereby making the surface more rough and porous.

solution of 5 min Ag-deposited Si (with 0.005 M
AgNO3) and (c) the Si etched in 0.6 M H2O2/4.8 M HF solution of 5 min Ag-deposited Si (with 0.005 M
AgNO3), (b) and (d) are their respective high magnification
HRTEM images.

The thickness of the wires decreases as the H2O2 concentration increases. The length of the nanowires increases from
7 to 20 μm for 5 min Ag film as the H2O2 concentration increased from 0.05 to 0.3 M. From HRTEM images, it
is evident that the thickness decreases from 300 to 100 nm as the
H2O2 concentration increases.

Mechanism of
Formation
Step I
During Ag deposition, two simultaneous process
happens deposition of Ag and etching of Si. Because the electrochemical
potential of Ag+/Ag is more positive than the fermi energy
of the Si substrate, holes are injected into the valence band of Si
from Ag+ when Si substrate is immersed in HF/AgNO3 solution. The Ag+ reduces to Ag, forming a nuclei in
the local site. Simultaneously, the holes that are injected into the
valence band of Si from the Ag particles locally oxidize Si, which
gets dissolved by HF. Si atoms under the Ag particles get dissolved;
as a result, the Ag particles sink into the Si substrate.1,7,39,44−46 This process is represented in eqs 1–3. The overall
reaction during Ag deposition is given in eq4. In this case, the etching of Si is meager.

 4  When the Si substrate is immersed
in HF/AgNO3 solution,
Ag starts nucleating initially for very short deposition time (15
s) and small, well-separated nearly spherical-shaped nanoparticles
are formed; as the deposition time is increased, the Ag nanoparticles
continue to grow in size, increasing the surface coverage of the substrate.
When the deposition time is increased further, the nucleated Ag particles
coalescence with the neighboring particle. When the deposition time
is further prolonged to 5 min, Ag particles grow and reach a percolation
threshold, which forms a discontinuous thin film.

Step II
In the second step, Ag-deposited Si substrate
is immersed in HF/ H2O2 solution and etching
of Si at Ag-deposited sites takes place. The Ag nanoparticle possesses
higher electronegativity than Si and therefore strongly attracts electron
from Si. Si loses electron to the Ag nuclei and it gets oxidized,
to form silicon dioxide underneath the Ag particles. The oxidized
Si (SiO2) is etched away by HF. The electrons are transferred
to silver particles, which in turn reduces H2O2 on the surface of metal particle facing the electrolyte. Thus, the
excess collected electrons are used to reduce H2O2. After reducing H2O2, the Ag particle collects
electrons again and oxidizes Si. The collected electron in turn reduces
H2O2. This process continues forming pits at
the site where Ag was deposited.39,40,44 Here, H2O2 acts as a driving
force in etching. It acts as scavenger of electrons from the Ag nanoparticle;
in other words, H2O2 locally oxidizes Ag to
Ag+. Ag+ ions formed tend to become Ag by quickly
reacting with the Si atoms to get back as Ag. As H2O2 scavenges more electrons from Ag, more electrons from the
Si is collected by the Ag and this process continues. This process
is schematically shown in Figure 6. The possible chemical reactions during the etching
process are given in eqs 5–8. Ag surface facing the electrolyte
acts as cathode, where H2O2 reduced to H2O, and is given in eq 5. At anode, Si is oxidized to SiO2 and the formed
SiO2 simultaneously dissolves in HF solution; these reactions
are given in eqs 6 and 7. The total reaction is given in eq 8.45

Figure 6 Schematic
to explain the etching of Si.

At cathode (Ag surface facing electrolyte) 5  At anode (Ag at Ag/Si interface) 6   7  Total reaction 8  The potential of the total reaction can be
expressed as given below. 9  The etch rate of Si depends on scavenging
rate of electrons by H2O2 from Ag; therefore,
the concentration of H2O2 plays a key role in
etching. At low H2O2 concentration, scavenging
rate of electrons by H2O2 is low and therefore
the etching rate is also low. At high H2O2 concentration,
scavenging rate of electrons by H2O2 is high
and therefore the etching rate is also high.

Depending on the
size of the Ag and the H2O2 concentration, random-structured
porous Si or Si nanowires are formed.
Therefore, etch depth and the morphology are dependent on both the
H2O2 concentration and the size of the deposited
Ag. For isolated small Ag nanoparticles, the interaction between the
Si and the Ag is not restricted by its surroundings. Once the Ag particles
start etching, they interact with Si in all directions except the
top.2 The electronegativity of the Ag particles
tends to move the particles toward Si atoms. Thus, the Ag particle
gets divided, which causes random etching and resulted in porous Si
nanostructures. The randomness of the pores reduces as the Ag particle
size increases. Unlike isolated particles, in discontinuous film,
the clusters are bound to each other, and during etching, the movement
of Ag clusters is restricted, resulting in collective sinking of the
discontinuous Ag network vertically down. Very small Ag particles
detach from the bigger clusters along their way vertical down, and
this etches the side walls of the wires, causing porous structures
to vertical Si nanowire structure, which is proved by elemental mapping.
For this study, after etching in 0.3 M H2O2/4.8
M HF, the substrate was washed with deionized water and taken for
elemental mapping study. Figure 7 shows the elemental analysis of Si nanowires without
removing Ag to show the disintegration of Ag and the presence of Ag
in the nanowire walls. Figure 7a shows the cross section of the nanowire etched in 0.3 M
H2O2/4.8 M HF solution with 5 min Ag-deposited
Si in 0.005 M AgNO3. In the figure, the Ag particles present
at the root of the nanowires can be seen. Figure 7b shows the corresponding combined (Si and
Ag) elemental map, where pink represents Si and yellow represents
Ag. Figure 7b,c shows
the corresponding individual elemental maps of Si and Ag, from which
it could be seen that, at the root of the nanowires, the presence
of Ag is large, which represents the bigger particles. The presence
of lower amount of Ag in the nanowire walls is also seen. Elemental
mapping analysis thus confirms the dissociation of Ag and deposition
of Ag in the nanowire walls.

For medium-sized Ag particles,
the etching in lower H2O2 concentration is directional.
At high H2O2 concentration, the etching is directional,
but there
is disintegration in the wall structure. Because the electron-scavenging
rate (from Ag to H2O2) and the electron collecting
rate (from Si to Ag) are not at equilibrium, the disassociation of
Ag takes place from the mother nuclei. The disassociated Ag etches
the side walls therefore resulting in distorted wall structure. When
we increase the H2O2 concentration, the potential
for the etching process (hole supply) also increases, which can be
known from eq 9. The
driving force for the etching process becomes larger and thus increases
the etching rate.

When the H2O2 concentration
is high, the
concentration of Ag+ is also high. The system tries to
equilibrate by collecting the electrons through Si/Ag interface. If
the equilibrium is not attained by converting Ag+ to Ag,
then excess Ag+ ions remains. These being highly electronegative will
seek and diffuse into the side wall of Si, where it collects electrons
from the side wall of Si and gets detached from the mother Ag cluster
and renucleates, forming a new silver nanoparticle and a new etch
path. Thus, the increase in H2O2 concentration
increases the amount of free Ag+, which tends to increase
the porosity as well as the etching rate.45,46 For discontinuous Ag film, that is, for 5 min Ag deposition and
lower H2O2 concentration (0.05 and 0.1 M), formation
of wall-like structure results, as seen in the FESEM images of Figures 2d,h and 3d,h. The overall thickness of the wall structure
is around a micron. For higher H2O2 concentration
(0.3 M), wire morphology is obtained with lower thickness. At higher
H2O2 concentration, the Ag to Ag+ conversion rate is high and as a result Ag particle film tends to
equilibrate the reaction by disintegrating themselves and finding
new etch paths. Thus, small Ag particles tend to disintegrate into
even much smaller fragments and exhibit random etching, forming porous
silicon, whereas larger Ag particles lead to vertical etching and
form nanowire structure.

Figure 8A1 shows
the schematic of the etching process of small Ag particles with low
H2O2 concentration. Small Ag particles travel
in all directions and thus finally create a random porous structure.
The Ag particles get separated and renucleate to form newer nuclei
for etching, which further get divided and the process continues. Figure 8A2 shows the schematic
of the etching process of small Ag particles with high H2O2 concentration. Here, the high H2O2 concentration increases
the etching rate and results in more randomness in the etching direction;
therefore, the pores reach higher depth than those in the low H2O2 concentration. When the Ag particle size increases
over 100 nm, the etching becomes directional, that is, vertically
down; here, the diameter of the etched nanowires is high and the surface
porosity will be very low.

Figure 8 Schematic to explain the formation pathway of
the PS and SiNWs
(features in the schematic are not to be scaled).

In the case of higher H2O2 concentration,
the Ag particles will diffuse the side walls and renucleation takes
place around the mother Ag particle, which will further undergo renucleation
and etching. For discontinuous Ag film, when the H2O2 concentration is low, the etching is directional, with etching
shape dependent on the deposited Ag film. For medium H2O2 concentration, the discontinuous Ag film subdivides
and etches vertically downward. When the H2O2 concentration is very high, that is, above particular limit, the
discontinuous Ag film subdivides and etches vertically downward, with
thickness of the wires lower compared to that at lower H2O2 concentration. These etching pathways are depicted
in Figure 8B1,B2, respectively.

Conclusions
Strategy for fabrication of the porous
Si and Si nanowires has
been developed by controlling various parameters like AgNO3 concentration, Ag size, and H2O2 concentration.
The size of the Ag particles and H2O2 concentration
determine the Si etching morphology. For isolated small Ag nanoparticles,
the etching is random irrespective of the concentration of H2O2. For lower H2O2 concentration,
the etch depth and randomness are less, whereas for higher H2O2 concentration, these are high. Equilibrium electron
supply from Si and equilibrium scavenging rate by H2O2 (lower concentration) lead to directional etching, forming
wall structure. Higher scavenging rate causes higher conversion rate
of Ag to Ag+, where the system tries to equilibrate the
reaction by collecting more electrons from Si. Under this condition,
Ag becomes unstable and gets disassociated and forms new etch paths
so that more electrons can be collected from the Si. The thickness
of the nanowires can be controlled by controlling the H2O2 concentration. With discontinuous Ag film structure,
increasing the H2O2 concentration, the thickness
decreases and the length of the nanowire increases. Thus, in this
work, we demonstrate by optimizing Ag size and H2O2 concentration that we can control the Si etching from highly
porous random structure to vertically aligned Si nanowires for various
potential applications. We anticipate that
this work might be useful for the researchers to fabricate desirable
nanostructures for their potential applications.

Experimental Section
Si etching was done in two steps: Ag deposition and etching of
Si in HF/H2O2.

Ag Deposition
Ag deposition was done in two different
AgNO3 concentrations (0.0017 and 0.005 M). The N-type Si
wafer of ⟨100⟩ orientation with 1–10 Ω
cm was sequentially cleaned in acetone, 2-propanol, and deionized
water (three times) and in boiling piranha solution (H2SO4/H2O2 in the volume ratio of
3:1) for 1 h (caution: extremely corrosive and highly exothermic reaction)
and then rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and dipped into a
10% HF solution for 1 min. A cleaned Si wafer was immersed in the
mixture of 4.8 M HF and 0.005 M AgNO3 solution for different
time periods (30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min) at room temperature.
Ag nanoparticles were deposited on Si wafer surfaces. Then, the Si
wafer was taken out of the solution rapidly and rinsed with deionized
water.

Etching in HF/H2O2
Si substrate
covered with Ag nanoparticles was immersed in the etching solution
containing 5 M HF (0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 M), H2O2, and H2O in the volume ratio of 1:5:10 for 1 h
at room temperature. Finally, the Si wafer was immersed in concentrated
nitric acid for 1 h at room temperature to remove residual Ag nanoparticles
from the surfaces.
