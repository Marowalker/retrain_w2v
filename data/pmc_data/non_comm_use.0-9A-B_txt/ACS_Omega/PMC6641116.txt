Flexible batteries and supercapacitors
(SCs) are expected to play
a crucial role in energy storage and management in portable electronic
devices. In addition, use of materials based on renewable resources
would allow for more affordable and sustainable gadgets. In this context,
eggshell membranes (ESMs) represent a promising functional platform
for production of high-performance electronic components. In this
work, we use ESMs for preparing flexible SCs through the incorporation
of carbon nanotubes and subsequent in situ polymerization of polypyrrole,
producing a highly conductive nanostructure characterized by a porous
surface that exhibits both faradic and nonfaradic mechanisms for charge
storage. We have found that by controlling the conducting polymer/carbon
derivative relative concentration, one can maximize the corresponding
capacitance to attain values up to the order 564.5 mF/cm2 (areal capacitance), 24.8 F/cm3 (volumetric capacitance),
and 357.9 F/g (gravimetric capacitance). These bioinspired flexible
devices exhibit a capacitance retention of 60% after 4000 cycles of
charge/discharge and present negligible aging even after 500 bending
repetitions (at a density of current 5 mA/cm2). The successful
use of ESM-based electrodes in association with carbon derivatives/conducting
polymers confirm that the exploit of biological materials offers a
promising perspective for the development of new ecofriendly electronic
devices.

1 Introduction
The
increasing limitation in the availability of fossil and conventional
energy sources has encouraged the pursuit of more efficient power
sources, such as photovoltaic, piezoelectric, geothermal, among others.
Despite considerable progress made in that direction in recent years,
the pace of development of these alternative technologies remains
intermittent, and their more widespread use in practical devices will
only become reality with proper energy management and storage. In
this regard, the search for more efficient electrochemical devices
continues to be a fundamental task.1,2 Among these,
supercapacitors (SCs) stand out as specially promising alternative,
not only due to their characteristic fast charge–discharge
(CD) processes but also for their high power density, high cyclability,
and long life when their properties are compared to those of batteries.3−5 These characteristics make SC fill an optimal operational niche
apart from batteries and electrostatic capacitors, enabling the possibility
of storing and delivering charges at superior levels. More recently,
with the introduction of portable and wearable devices and the simultaneous
rise of the “internet of things,” the development of
electronics is experiencing a rapid transition from classical rigid
to lightweight flexible structures.6,7 Integration
of SCs in these new devices would allow for both a fast harvesting
of energy and a more efficient and optimized management of its consumption.
As an imperative requirement, however, these novel SCs must be lightweight,
inexpensive, flexible, stretchable, and able to be adapted in the
most capricious forms while preserving their function even under repeated
deformation. Fibers from natural and synthetic polymers possess the
ideal morphology for use in such devices, as their uniaxial structure
gives them the advantage of transmitting forces along their length,
reinforcing their mechanical properties while reducing the amount
of material that would be otherwise required.7 These benefits go further than those from mere physical support,
as fibers can be used to create porous membranes that would allow
the assembly of multiple nanostructures and multifunctional hierarchical
structures.8 The combination of such characteristics
makes these fibers promising building blocks for designing innovative
SCs. In fact, several works in the recent literature discuss the use
of natural materials, such as cellulosic fibrils from wood,9−11 bacteria,12−14 and cotton,15−17 or those of synthetic polymers,18−20 such as in the case of fibers produced by electrospinning. Although
these previous works exploit the benefits of using three-dimensional
(3D) templates for the development of flexible SCs, there are still
disadvantages associated with their production, such as the requirements
of laborious procedures and, in some cases, of use of a considerable
amount of toxic solvents. Considering those requirements, in the present
article we describe the use of eggshell membrane (ESM) as an ecofriendly
template for the assemblage of nanostructures with excellent capacitive
properties. As a refined and elegant material developed by nature,
ESMs exhibit a porous structure constituted by proteins that evolved
to play crucial roles in the development of the chicken embryo, such
as the protection conferred by the crystallization of CaCO3 and the critical proviso of adequate gas exchange.21,22 From a material science perspective, this hierarchical structure
is a fascinating scaffold for the tailoring of functional nanostructures
that could benefit from its good mechanical resistance, flexibility,
biodegradability, and porosity and exploit the abundant presence of
carboxylic, amino, and hydroxyl functional groups to incorporate active
materials.23,24 In addition, one of the most
attractive sustainable aspects of using ESM residues is the widespread
availability of eggshell as a waste material24 from which a preformed membrane can be easily recuperated, dispensing
the use of special resources for its treatment or preparation. Indeed,
in recent years, ESM has been considered as a convenient biotemplate
to produce self-standing composites for diverse applications, such
as sensors,25−27 adsorbents for water remediation,28,29 catalysis,30−33 fuel cells,34,35 and batteries.36,37 Of particular interest to us is their use in SCs as ESM electrodes38,39 and as separators, both in their in natural40 or modified41 forms.

In this work,
we propose the use of ESM as scaffolds for the development
of hybrid SCs. For this goal, we decided to combine two electroactive
materials, viz., multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),42 which are known to present electrochemical double-layer
capacitance, and polypyrrole (PPy), an intrinsically conducting polymer
that has a faradic behavior.43 The resulting
hybrid composite has some specific advantages that result from the
synergistic interactions between the high power density and cycling
stable CNTs and the polymer, wherein fast redox reactions are known
to occur.44−47

The strategy we adopted involved modification of the membrane
by
the electrostatic assembly of MWCNTs on the pristine ESM, which was
followed by in situ polymerization of pyrrole (Py). The ESM’s
special properties allow the preparation of hybrid electrodes in a
simple manner, wherein no binders are used or special chemical modifications
required.

The resulting increase in the final charge storage
capacity of
the prepared devices relies in the relevant characteristics of these
membranes, which not only offer adequate mechanical support but can
also act as efficient electrolyte reservoir because of their high
porosity. With this, the charge transfer processes in the devices
are not confined to a single interface but actually become a bulk
phenomenon. In the flexible SC devices discussed here, we employed
a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)–phosphoric acid (H3PO4) layer as a separator. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first time that the ESM simple architecture is exploited for
the design of lightweight flexible SCs. In Figure 1, we present an illustrative flowchart of
the device preparation, considering the devices prepared in the presence
(PPy–f-MWCNT–ESMs) and absence of MWCNT
(PPy–ESMs).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology
and Structure
Due to the
need of allowing different types of mass, gas, and liquid transfer
processes for the exchange of nutrients and products, typically biomaterials
have a porous and hierarchical structure. These characteristics have
motivated previous works to exploit the ESM chemical composition and
morphology for producing porous carbonized electrodes.38,39 Considering these examples, we have found that in a manner somewhat
similar to the case of cellulose fibers,12 the ESMs themselves offer a perfect combination of chemical composition,
structure, and mechanical properties for flexible electrodes. As it
is possible to observe in Figure 2a, ESM (in this case, its outer membrane) exhibits
a 3D porous framework constituted by microfibers (1.95 ± 1.28
μm), which are composed mainly of collagen types I, V, and X48 known to exhibit a vast number of amino, carboxylic,
and hydroxyl groups, among other functional moieties. Such proteic
composition can favor interaction with molecules and some charged
nanostructures. As mentioned above, we have prepared mixed membranes
of two types: in the first, PPy was grown directly into pristine ESM,
whereas in the other, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were first incorporated
into the ESM and then the polymerization of Py was promoted.

Figure 2 Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of pristine ESM (a), f-MWCNT–ESM
(b), and magnified image of f-MWCNT–ESM (c).

As ESM is an electrical insulator,
our main purpose for the incorporation
of MWCNTs was to increase the electrical conductivity of the modified
samples. For this task, we took advantage of the chemical composition
of the ESM to assemble the functionalized MWCNT (f-MWCNT) on its surface under ultrasonication. At this point, it is
necessary to stress that ultrasonication guarantees good dispersion
of the f-MWCNTs, thus avoiding the use of surfactants
that could influence the final properties of the composite or inhibit
their adsorption in the ESM. In fact, ultrasonication speeds up the
adsorption of f-MWCNTs on the ESM, as the associated
microjets and shock waves favor the carrying of the f-MWCNTs, which will collapse on the ESM fibers surface. In that way,
a combination of physical forces provided by the ultrasonication and
the chemical contribution of electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding,
and hydrophobic interactions between the functional groups in the
fibers and in the f-MWCNTs accounts for the continuing
deposition of the latter.49 As shown in
the corresponding SEM images (Figure 2b,c), although the integrity of the membrane is preserved,
the surface of the modified fibers becomes rougher due to the increasing
density of incorporated f-MWCNTs.

The simplicity
of this process should be contrasted to the laborious
procedures usually adopted to coat a nonwoven (such as paper, electrospun
fibers, or cotton) matrix with MWCNTs, when a surfactant must be used
to produce an ink, which is then applied with a binding polymer to
the material surface, normally with the help of high-energy ultrasonication.10,50,51

The inclusion of PPy on
the ESM and f-MWCNT–ESM
was carried through an in situ polymerization methodology by utilizing
a 1:1 Py/FeCl3 ratio, whereas the Py concentration was
varied from 0.01 to 0.08 M. As shown in Figure S1, one can note that the amount of PPy per square centimeter
becomes larger with the increase in the Py concentration used. When
comparing the resulting morphology of the two membranes, the most
obvious difference lies in the porosity, which is almost lost in the
PPy–ESM sample (Figure S2a) but
preserved in the other (Figure S2b). This
difference could be explained by considering that the presence of f-MWCNTs provides several carboxylic groups that possess
high affinity toward intrinsically conducting polymers.52 As can be observed in Figure 3c,d, the PPy growth occurs mainly along the
axial directions; in contrast, when no such groups are present, the
polymer is formed in all directions, reducing the ESM porosity—see Figure 3a,b.

and PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM (e). Response to
mechanical stimulus (f, g) and characteristic low resistance, applied
as conducting wire in a circuit (h) of sample PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM.

The second feature that
deserves attention is the difference in
morphology, as the presence of clusters of PPy nanoparticles can be
identified in the PPy–ESM samples, whereas the PPy–f-MWCNT–ESMs exhibit nanotubular structures. Such
changes can be explained by the progress in polymerization process.
In the beginning, the ESM adsorbs Py monomers through hydrogen bonding
between the amino and hydroxyl groups,53 favoring the PPy formation. As the reaction proceeds, however, increasing
number of counterions (Cl– anions) are required
to balance the charge, and this must be supplied by the aqueous medium
that permeates through the porous ESM. If the polymer growth is fast,
the newly formed PPy nanoparticles become fused, resulting in the
formation of microscopic plates that bind to the collagen fibers and
encapsulate them, consequently clogging the original porous ESM structure.
However, if present, f-MWCNT can serve not only as
a doping agent but also as a template to guide the PPy deposition54,55 (Figure 3d), so that
no intraporous clusters are formed.

The digital images shown
in Figure 3e illustrate
the degree of adhesion and the homogeneous
distribution of CNTs (f-MWCNT–ESM) and PPy
+ (CNTs) (PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM) on the ESM
surface. The characteristic flexibility (i.e., a superior bending
and twisting capability of the resulting material) can be visualized
in Figure 3f,g. The
high conductivity of the PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM
enables its use as contacts in simple electrical circuits, such as
those comprising a battery and a light-emitting diode shown in Figure 3h.

The presence
of CNT, PPy, and CNT/PPy on the ESM structure was
confirmed by Raman investigation (Figure 4). The corresponding f-MWCNT–ESM
spectrum is characterized by a D band at 1351 cm–1 and a G band (associated with the tangential vibration modes) at
1578 cm–1. The response of the PPy–ESM sample
is evidenced by the presence of peaks at 1348 cm–1 (due to the ring-stretching vibration) and 1581 cm–1 (which corresponds to the −C=C stretching vibration
of the PPy backbone).56−58 It should be noted that the wavelengths of these
latter peaks are higher than those of the corresponding absorptions
for the PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM system (1339
and 1566 cm–1, respectively). The shift in the position
of these peaks is associated with the longer conjugation length of
the resulting polymeric chains,59 an evidence
that a material with superior electrical response results from the
CNTs/PPy interaction. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum
shown in Figure 4b
allows a better identification of the contributions from the two components.
The peak at 1545 cm–1 corresponds to the stretching
vibration of C=C of PPy, whereas the vibration corresponding
to the C–N bond of PPy60−62 can be seen at 1456/1189 cm–1. The peaks at 1037 and 964 cm–1 are assigned to the C–H in-plane vibration band and the in-plane
bending of Py,63 respectively. The additional
peak identified at 1640 cm–1 characterizes the presence
of amide I, a component of the ESM collagen.64

2.2 Electrochemical
Characterization of the Devices
The presence of CNTs affects
the electrochemical behavior of the
resulting device in terms of its transport and polarization characteristics.
We compared the C–V curves
and impedance spectra of the samples prepared in both the absence
and presence of CNTs using different concentrations of Py. The corresponding
voltammograms and R–X diagrams,
which are shown in Figure 5, provide relevant information about the influence of the
additives used (CNT and PPy) on the overall response of the device.

Comparing the C–V curves,
it is possible to identify that the presence of CNT improves the electrochemical
performance of the device (because the specific capacitance is proportional
to the area enclosed by the curve)—particularly in terms of
the maximum current observed and the more rectangular curve shape,
typical of an electric double-layer capacitor signature. Examining Figure 5a,c, one can see
that the CNT influence is stronger for the sample prepared using a
lower Py concentration (0.02 M). As a consequence, the competition
established between PPy and CNT tends in favor of the CNT behavior
at a lower concentration of the conducting polymer, as expected. On
the other hand, as shown in Figure 5c, minimal change in the C–V is observed for samples prepared using a high concentration
of the conducting polymer, confirming that the good coverage provided
by PPy (as shown in the SEM images) results in a higher level of conductivity
and a lower CNT relative contribution on the overall response.

The more rectangular shape of the C–V curves for the samples containing f-MWCNT
suggests a capacitive behavior.65 However,
the corresponding C–V curves
for PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM have become more
prolate (“cone-shaped”) due to the presence of the incorporated
PPy chains,66 as shown in Figure 5c.

Examining the impedance
(Figure 5b,d), one
can observe that the samples containing CNTs
exhibit superior electrical properties: the intersection of Z″ with the x axis (which corresponds
to the bulk resistance value) is lower for samples in which f-MWCNTs are present, irrespective of the Py concentration
used. However, this difference in the electrical response between
samples prepared in the absence and presence of f-MWCNT is minimized in the case of a higher PPy content (Figure 5d).

Figure 5 Comparison of voltammograms
of samples PPy–ESM and PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM
using 0.02 M of Py (a) and 0.05 M (c)
at scan rate of 50 mV/s and corresponding impedance spectrum using
0.02 M (b) and 0.05 M (d) and corresponding scheme for charge storage
mechanism of CNT/PPy in H3PO4/PVA electrolyte
(e).

These effects contribute to the
reduction in the IR drop (i.e.,
the negligible voltage drop associated with the internal resistance
of the sample), which is of the order of 3 Ω for the PPy−f-MWCNT−ESM samples. This characterizes a material
with a superior electrical performance (such as fast charge accumulation)
that can be associated to a low resistance for charge circulation
and piling up at the electrodes.

In Figure 5e, we
present a schematic view of the charge storage process occurring in
the CNT/PPy samples in the presence of H3PO4/PVA: as H3PO4 is dissociated into H+ and H2PO4– in the gel (the
latter thus becoming the dominant species), when PPy is p-doped for
the first time, the Cl– anions are replaced by H2PO4– counter ions to balance
the charge. To better investigate the (faradic or nonfaradic) storage
mechanisms that prevail in the absence/presence of CNTs, we examined
the variation in the maximum current observed in the C–V curves with the scan rate υ, by
assuming the relationship 1  where C is a parameter that
depends on the electrode area and on the intrinsic properties of the
device, whereas b is associated with the specific
dominant mechanism for charge accumulation. In particular, b = 1 characterizes a surface-limited process in which both
double layer charging and pseudocapacitive behavior are dominant,
whereas b = 0.5 characterizes a diffusion process.9 The value of b can be obtained
from the slope of the log(I) versus log(scan rate)
curve. In Figure 6,
we present the corresponding curves for the samples of interest. As
one can see, a stronger variation in the b value
is observed for samples prepared in the presence of a lower concentration
of Py (0.02 M), with a smaller slope (0.55) being found for the sample
prepared by direct PPy deposition on the supporting ESM, wherein a
diffusion-dependent process is favored.

Figure 6 Dependence of current I(V) as
a function of different scan rate for samples PPy–ESM and PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM (0.02 and 0.05 M).

Hence, a capacitive surface process is dominant for the sample
in which CNTs are incorporated on the ESM before the PPy deposition,
with a slope value of the order of 1. However, the slope is essentially
the same for the samples prepared in the presence of a larger Py concentration
(0.05 M), irrespective of whether the CNTs are present or not, indicating
that a larger amount of incorporated PPy dampens the CNT contribution
to the charge storage mechanism of diffusion-controlled and capacitive-controlled
processes. Thus, in this case, the overall process tends to be dominated
by mixed diffusion-controlled and capacitive mechanisms, and the slope
of the curves is 0.77, a value that can be associated with an increase
in the CD current, characterizing the superior electrical properties
of PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM-based electrodes.
For comparison, we fabricated a SC based only on f-MWCNT–ESM. For these SCs, as determined from the C–V diagram (Figure S3a), due to the high impedance (Figure S3b), a negligible capacitance is a strong indication
that the electrochemical properties of the ESM-based SCs are in fact
critically dependent on the presence of the conducting polymer.

2.3 Optimization of Charge Storage Mechanisms
The previous results indicate that PPy/CNTs composites are an essential
component of flexible SCs based on the ESM support because of the
capacitive processes occurring in the mesoporous structure of the
covered membrane and the improved electrical properties (as revealed
by impedance spectra measurements). In addition, the relative amount
of incorporated PPy also plays a role in determining the characteristics
of the final device. As observed, although the capacitive properties
of CNTs are evident at low PPy concentration, a diffusion-controlled
behavior takes place with increasing concentration of the conducting
polymer. As result of the competition established between capacitive
and diffusion-dependent processes, one can explore the existence of
an “optimum” PPy–f-MWCNT relative
concentration at which both properties would be ideally balanced.
In this direction, we have prepared SCs of PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM, wherein the Py concentration was varied in the
0.02–0.08 M range. The corresponding cyclic voltammograms are
shown in Figure 7,
where it is possible to identify the general trend of an increase
in the current with the increment in the scan voltage ratio.

Figure 7 Dependence
of current I(V) as
function of different scan rate for PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM
(0.02 M (a), 0.03 M (b), 0.05 M (c), and 0.08 M (d)) and specific
capacitance for different scan rate for PPy–ESM (e) and PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM (f).

Note that at lower scan rate, the curves obtained for all
the samples
present a rectangular shape that is progressively modified to a more
oblate form as the scan rate is increased.4 This change is more evident for the samples prepared in the presence
of a higher amount of PPy; hence, one can expect that the ESM SC capacitive
behavior tends to be progressively affected once the concentration
of incorporated conducting polymer reaches a critical range.

As a general behavior, the specific capacitance tends to be strongly
affected by changes in the scan rate due to the characteristic time
for ion migration in the material. As the scan rate increases, there
is a progressive reduction in the ion concentration on the surface
of the electrodes, defining the existence of a limiting mass transfer
step, which leads to a decrease in the specific capacitance. On the
other hand, the highly conductive supports allow an efficient access
for electrons and ions, facilitating the occurrence of fast redox
reactions at higher scan rates. As one can see in Figure 7e, the general behavior of
the samples prepared using pristine PPy is to exhibit a diminishing
specific capacitance as the scan rate increases. At a relatively low
polymer concentration, the PPy/CNT samples typically present an increase
in the capacitance (see Figure 7f) due to the prevalence of the highly conductive CNTs/PPy
nanofibrous structure. This behavior changes as the polymer concentration
increases and the contribution of redox processes becomes favored.
It is worth noting that in the absence of CNT and an increase in the
Py concentration, the best performance is attained in samples containing
0.03 M, as shown in Figure 7e: the fast decrease in the capacitance with the scan rate
variation at a higher Py concentration (0.05 M) is an evidence that
the presence of PPy in high enough concentrations contributes to the
inhibition of charge separation, with a consequent decrease in the
overall efficiency of the charge transport and separation. On the
other hand, the best performance of the samples prepared in the presence
of PPy/CNT is obtained when using the intermediate Py concentration
(0.05 M), whereas the behavior of the samples with a lower polymer
content indicates that the high conductivity of the support leads
to an increasing capacitance at higher scan rates.67 When analyzing the data presented in Figure 7, one can see as a general feature that for
equivalent values of the scan rate and voltage, the maximum value
attained by the current initially increases with the relative amount
of incorporated PPy, an indication of a progressive improvement in
the electrochemical properties of the devices. However, the maximum
value of the current becomes smaller for the sample prepared with
the highest Py concentration (0.08 M), whose C–V curve presents a more accentuated cone shape, characterizing
a limiting condition for electrochemical performance of the device.

In addition, we performed CD experiments using a fixed 0.5/–0.5
mA current level, with an applied potential in the 0.0–0.5
V range (Figure 8a).
As one can see, the total time taken to complete a CD cycle initially
increases with the amount of PPy incorporated into the device, but
a smaller time is registered for the 0.08 M sample due to the reduction
in the available sites for charge distribution and accumulation. For
all curves, the typical value of the IR drop signature (i.e., the
abrupt change in the CD curve in the transition from charge-to-discharge
process) is negligible, a fact that can be associated with the contribution
of the CNTs for the electrical properties of the template (lower internal
resistance). This result is consistent with the information gathered
from both the morphological analysis and the corresponding voltammograms.

Figure 8 (a) CD
curves for samples of PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM
at increasing PPy concentration. (b) R–X diagram of the corresponding samples.

As for the electrical properties, as shown in Figure 8b for 0.02, 0.03, and 0.05
M samples, the bulk resistance is of the order of 3 Ω, with
an increase to the 4 Ω range being verified for the sample containing
0.08 M Py. The minimal variation in the bulk resistance of sample
indicates that PPy introduces improved electrical properties for the
sample in the explored concentration range. To examine this in more
detail, we summarized in Table 1 the capacitances of the resulting devices based on the PPy
active layer (PPy weight) and whole weight (gravimetric capacitance),
area (CA), and volume (Cv) at a current density of 0.5 mA/cm2 (the
corresponding equations are described in the Supporting Information).

Table 1 Comparison of Capacitances
of PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM at Increasing PPy
Concentration
Py concentration (M)	CSP active layer (F/g)	CSP whole device (F/g)	CA (mF/cm2)	CV (F/cm3)	
0.02	134.2	43.0	87.5	4.3	
0.03	384.2	122.8	249.0	9.6	
0.05	357.9	153.2	369.5	15.7	
0.08	224.3	155.0	546.5	24.8	
The specific capacitance (Csp) of the
active material, which goes through a maximum of 384.2 F/g for the
sample prepared using a 0.03 M Py solution, decreases when the PPy
content is further increased (224.3 F/g for the 0.08 M sample). A
different behavior is observed for the capacitance of the whole device
(i.e., when an ESM layer is present), which reaches a saturating value
close to 153 F/g when Py concentrations equal or above 0.05 M were
used. As for the areal CA and volumetric
(Cv) capacitance, both increase with an
increment in the polymer content, with the devices prepared using
a 0.08 M Py solution exhibiting the highest values (546.5 mF/cm2 and 24.8 F/cm3, respectively). Hence, considering
these results and after analyzing the corresponding mechanical resistance
of the samples, we suggest that the use of 0.05 M Py solutions offers
the best compromise between good electrochemical properties and adequate
flexibility, which would result in an optimized device performance.

Indeed, important functional characteristics to be considered in
the design of usable SCs are their capacitance retention and bending
resistance, which are essential requirements for their practical use
in long-life flexible storage devices. For investigating the retention
capacity of 0.05 M PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM
SCs, we performed successive CD cycles in which the current was varied
in the 5 to −5 A/g range. The observed variation in the specific
capacitance is shown in Figure 9a.

Figure 9 (a) Capacitance retention of PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM
samples (PPy 0.05 M), (b) influence of the cycling degradation of
the corresponding C–V diagram,
(c) corresponding R–X diagrams
for pristine and degraded samples, and (d) C–V diagrams of devices after 500 cycles of bending.

The “aging” of the
devices can be determined by examining
the changes in their C–V curve
along this CD process. At first, one can expect that it should occur
at an interfacial exchange of anions between the polymer and the phosphate-based
electrolyte due to the initial difference in the corresponding concentrations.
After an equilibrium condition is reached, a typical profile of degradation
begins to be observed. The continuous use of the device returns values
for the capacitance retention of the order of 60% after 4000 test
cycles (Figure 9a),
a value that compares favorably relative to those of SCs based on
PPy immersed in liquid electrolytes.45 Corresponding C–V curves at 50 mV/s (shown in Figure 9b) reveal the resulting
degradation after 4000 cycles at 5 A/g. The impedance data (shown
in Figure 9c) reveal
that aging induces an increase in the internal resistance of the samples,
confirming the degradation identified in the C–V curves.

In addition to testing the mechanical flexibility
and performance
resistance of the devices after repeated folding and unfolding cycles,
we examined the possible degrading of their electrochemical characteristics
after successive treatment with bending assays. As shown in Figure 9d, the voltammogram
of the 0.05 M PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM device
remains essentially the same after repeated mechanical assays, with
no detectable change in the prevailing charge storage mechanisms.
In this manner, the 0.05 M PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM
device complies with a stringent requirement for the practical use
of flexible SCs.

One could observe that the specific capacitance
of a device, a
defining characteristic of its performance, usually exhibits a strong
dependence on the adopted electrochemical setup (e.g., whether a two-
or three-electrode configuration is adopted, or a solid or liquid
electrolyte is used), operating scan rate, and applied current density.
As a consequence, when evaluating different experimental systems,
one should be careful in taking adequate balance of these critical
parameters. In Table 2, we compare the overall characteristics of the 0.05 and 0.08 M PPy–f-MWCNT–ESMs, such as their specific areal and volumetric
and gravimetric capacitances, to those of similar SCs recently discussed
in the literature. As one can observe, the 0.08 M bioinspired SC introduced
in the present work shows both areal and gravimetric capacitances
that are higher than those of other flexible devices based on templates
composed by pure conducting materials (such as graphene68,69 or CNTs70,71). The value for its volumetric capacitance C–V is only surpassed by that of
the device produced with a thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
(PEDOT)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS)–graphene layer,
in which the amount of active material present is greater and which
operates at a higher potential window. It is an additional noteworthy
point that superior results were obtained for the PPY–f-MWCNT–ESM devices when operating under more moderate
conditions, viz., low voltage window and low current density; a lesser
degradation should accompany its repeated operation under this situation,
allowing for an increase in the lifetime of the corresponding device.

In summary, the PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM
SCs discussed here appear as promising bioinspired devices, with competitive
operational performance if one considers the high values of their
areal and volumetric and gravimetric capacitive characteristics. One
should observe that these SCs were prepared using a widely available
resource usually classified as a waste material, an additional comparative
advantage for their possible use as a highly efficient and cost-effective
alternative for the design of flexible energy storage devices.

3 Conclusions
We have examined the use of ESM, a usually
discarded material of
biological origin, as a template for the development of flexible solid-state
SCs through the successive incorporation of CNTs and PPy. These hybrid
devices have shown promising operational characteristics in terms
of cyclability, electrochemical behavior, mechanical flexibility,
and production costs. The comparison of their performance parameters
with those of similar devices discussed in the literature places the
PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM SCs in the frontier
of highly efficient energy storage devices, with the additional advantage
of combining low production cost with ecofriendly processing. In fact,
the ESM macroporous structure can be exploited not only in applications
involving conducting polymers, but it could also be used as a general
platform for the assembly of metallic nanoparticles, carbon nanostructures,
metal oxides, among others.

In summary, our results indicate
that ESM porous structure can
be considered as a binder-free and sustainable natural product with
promising possibilities of application in energy storage devices due
to its characteristic stability, flexibility, low cost, and large
availability of sites for the incorporation of additives.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
All
eggs used were purchased
from the local market (Juazeiro, Brazil). Py, ferric chloride (FeCl3), MWCNT (diameter of 6–9 nm × length of 5 μm),
and PVA (MW 86–145 kDa) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. H3PO4, ethanol, nitric acid (HNO3), and
hydrochloric acid (HCl) were obtained from the Brazilian companies
Sigma-Vetec, Dinâmica, and Êxodo Científica,
respectively. All of the chemicals were of analytical grade and used
as received, except for Py, which was distilled twice under reduced
pressure before use. The ultrahigh purity water employed in all of
the experiments was obtained from a Millipore water system.

4.2 ESM Etching
After being broken and
drained, the fresh eggshells were washed several times with deionized
water until complete removal of the yolk and albumen residues. They
were then placed in a 1 M HCl solution for 2 h under constant stirring.
Subsequently, the ESM was manually removed and washed several times
in an acidic solution, until complete removal of CaCO3.
Finally, the ESMs were removed from the acid solution and washed several
times with deionized water until neutral pH was obtained.

4.3 MWCNT Assembly on ESM
First, the
MWCNTs were functionalized by refluxing them in a 1:3 HCl/HNO3 acidic mixture at 130 °C for 5 h. After allowing to
cool at room temperature, the MWCNT suspension was vacuum filtered
and washed with generous amounts of deionized water until the drained
liquid had a pH of ∼7. Finally, the f-MWCNTs
were dried at room conditions for 24 h. To assemble the f-MWCNT on the ESM fibers, rectangular pieces of ESM were immersed
in a 0.1 mg/mL f-MWCNT ethanol dispersion and sonicated
during three consecutive periods of 30 min, which were intercalated
by rinsing with deionized water (due to the characteristic porosity
degree of support, the required diffusion of CNTs into the structure
is favored by ultrasonic dispersion, which can be considered49 as a high-energy process for CNT incorporation).
Finally, the resulting f-MWCNT–ESMs were rinsed
several times with deionized water to remove unattached nanotubes
and then dried at room temperature.

4.4 Py Polymerization
on ESM and f-MWCNT–ESM
We coated
both pristine ESMs and f-MWCNT–ESMs with layers
of PPy through an in situ
chemical polymerization using a 1:1 monomer-to-oxidant ratio. First,
the sample of interest (ESM or f-MWCNT–ESM)
was immersed in 25 mL of a precooled 1 M HCl solution containing an
equivalent amount of Py (0.02, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.08 M) at 5 °C,
which was stirred for 30 min. Then, 25 mL of solution of FeCl3 solution (1:1 oxidant-to-monomer ratio) in 1 M of HCl with
a corresponding concentration of monomer (0.02, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.08
M) was added in a dropwise manner, with the complete polymerization
being allowed to occur for 2 h at 5 °C. Finally, the modified
samples (PPy–ESM or PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM)
were washed several times with deionized water and kept in deionized
water until use.

4.5 Fabrication of PPy–ESM
and PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM Semisolid State
Symmetric SCs
An aqueous PVA–H3PO4 gel electrolyte
was prepared by dissolving 10% w/v of PVA in deionized water at 85
°C, with the resulting suspension being maintained under constant
stirring until becoming clear. Subsequently, H3PO4 (10 mL of 85 wt % in aqueous solution) was introduced and the solution
vigorously stirred for 30 min. After cooling, the solution was cast
on a metal plate covered with parafilm and allowed to dry for 24 h
at room temperature at a relative humidity of 35% to form a thin membrane.
To assemble the SC, two 1 cm2 square pieces of PPy–ESM
or PPy–f-MWCNT–ESM that will serve
as electrodes were immersed in a 10% w/v H3PO4 aqueous solution for 10 min. Finally, when the electrodes were removed
from the solution and the excess humidity wiped, a PVA–H3PO4 membrane was sandwiched between them under
a transversally established pressure of 10 N/cm2.

4.6 Characterization Techniques
We have
used SEM to characterize the morphological features of all samples
by employing a FEG-SEM MIRA 3 (Tescan, Czech Republic). Due to the
high electrical conductivity of the samples, no previous metal-sputtering
treatment was necessary (except for the pure ESM, where a fine gold
layer was deposited). Raman spectra were obtained in the 800–2000
cm–1 region by using a microscopic confocal Raman
spectrometer (LabRAM Aramis; HORIBA Jobin Yvon, France), with a 633
nm He–Ne laser. The electrochemical testing of the prototype
symmetric SCs was carried in a two-electrode configuration. The devices
were mounted in a Solartron 12962A sample holder between two carbon
cloth electrodes. All electrochemical (cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic
CD, and electrochemical impedance) measurements were carried out at
room temperature using Autolab PGSTAT302N (Metrohm, Switzerland).
FTIR measurements were performed using the KBr method in IR Prestige-21
Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan).
