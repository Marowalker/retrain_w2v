Fluoroquinolones are a class of widely
prescribed antibiotics with
a broad range of activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and
some atypical microbes. Unfortunately, these drugs are associated
with significant adverse events including neuropathy, tendinopathy,
cardiac rhythm abnormalities, and mental health side effects. The
mechanism by which fluoroquinolones cause many of these toxicities
is unknown. The antibacterial mechanism of action involves disruption
of the catalytic mechanism of type-II topoisomerases in bacteria,
namely topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase. Fluoroquinolones inhibit the
ability of the enzymes to ligate cleaved DNA and result in single-
and double-stranded DNA breaks. Thus, there is an interest in investigating
whether human topoisomerase II is involved in mediating the adverse
events associated with quinolones. Previous studies demonstrate some
response of human topoisomerase IIα and IIβ to high levels
of ciprofloxacin. However, it is not clear whether the concentration
of ciprofloxacin utilized in those studies corresponds to concentrations
that would be routinely achievable in patients. Therefore, this study
set out to examine three clinically relevant fluoroquinolones along
with two older agents to determine whether these compounds display
activity against topoisomerase IIα and IIβ at drug concentrations
that more closely approximate typical patient plasma values. On the
basis of our evidence, none of the quinolones studied were able to
poison DNA cleavage by either human enzyme. Ciprofloxacin, desethylene-ciprofloxacin,
and the recently removed from market gemifloxacin were able to inhibit
topoisomerase II-mediated DNA relaxation at concentrations of 200–300
μM. On the basis of these data, we propose that human topoisomerase
II is not likely to be the main cause of these adverse events and
that additional targets need to be identified to clarify the mechanisms
underlying quinolone toxicities.

==== Body
Introduction
Fluoroquinolones are a widely used class
of antimicrobial agents
first introduced into clinical practice in the 1960s.1 Nalidixic acid, serendipitously isolated as an impurity
in the synthesis of the antimalarial chloroquine, was the first quinolone
compound and was found to exhibit bactericidal activity against Gram-negative
bacteria.1,2 Although its mechanism of action was at
the time ill-defined, its clinical application was suitable albeit
limited to the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs).2,3

Subsequent development yielded additional related compounds
that
were fluorinated and which demonstrated a lower degree of resistance
than did nalidixic acid. These early fluoroquinolones exhibited limited
systemic bioavailability, consequent low systemic concentrations,
and multiple daily dosing.1 The clinical
utilization of these agents thus remained relatively confined to infections
of the genitourinary tract.4,5

Structural modifications
to the fluoroquinolone backbone continued
to proliferate that resulted in compounds that displayed pharmacokinetic
improvements (e.g., once-daily dosing) along with a significantly
expanded spectra of antimicrobial activity that now, in addition to
Gram-negative organisms, includes Gram-positive, atypical, and, for
some quinolones, anaerobic organisms.1,2,4,5 From a class of agents
that originated with a narrow clinical indication limited to UTI treatment,
the fluoroquinolones are now routinely employed in the treatment of
numerous infections including respiratory, genitourinary, gastrointestinal
tract infections, skin and soft tissue, and bone infections.2 Fluoroquinolones represent one of the most highly
prescribed antibiotic classes with approximately 30 million prescriptions
issued in 2016.6 Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin,
and moxifloxacin are among the most commonly prescribed fluoroquinolones.

The development and expansion of the fluoroquinolone class—in
both the number of agents and in their therapeutic utilization—has
been accompanied by clinical enthusiasm. However, this justifiable
optimism has been somewhat tempered by a history that includes a significant
number of fluoroquinolone agents being withdrawn from the market because
of significant and sometimes fatal toxicities.3,5 Over
the past decade, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released
numerous safety warnings regarding serious adverse effects associated
with currently available systemic fluoroquinolones with warnings issued
to highlight the risk of tendonitis, tendon rupture, cardiac rhythm
abnormalities, and central nervous system effects including seizures
and peripheral neuropathy.7

The risk
of peripheral neuropathy has been identified in the package
insert of fluoroquinolones since 2004. However, in August 2013, because
of a review by the FDA that identified the risk of this adverse effect
to be rapid in the onset, potentially permanent, and often disabling,
labeling changes were made to intensify and better characterize this
warning.8 Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy
described in the FDA report include “pain, burning, tingling,
numbness, weakness, or a change in sensation to light touch, pain
or temperature, or the sense of body position”.8 In a case-controlled study of men of 45–80 years
old from 2001 to 2011, Etminan et al. validated that fluoroquinolone
users were at increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy.9 When stratified by the type of fluoroquinolone,
the risk was similar. The exact mechanism(s) by which fluoroquinolones
cause peripheral neuropathy and other adverse events remains yet to
be elucidated.

Fluoroquinolones are known to disrupt the function
of bacterial
type-II topoisomerases, in particular, topoisomerase IV in Gram-positive
and DNA gyrase in Gram-negative bacteria, although there are exceptions
to this generalization.10,11 Topoisomerases are
responsible for regulating the topology of DNA and are found across
all three domains of life.12 Type-II topoisomerases
alleviate positive supercoiling that occurs during transcription and
replication and decatenate sister chromatids during replication termination
by generating a transient double-stranded DNA break.13 These enzymes pass an intact DNA helix through the temporary
double-stranded break (DSB) before ligating the DNA back together.
Disruption of this mechanism has been used in both antimicrobial and
anticancer therapeutics.10,14,15 Humans encode two isoforms of topoisomerase II: topoisomerase IIα
and IIβ, which are known targets for anticancer agents.13,14,16 Both isoforms are found in the
nucleus and the mitochondria.17−19

Oxidative stress and mitochondrial
dysfunction have been detected
in model systems in the presence of fluoroquinolones and have been
offered as possible causes for several of the observed adverse events
in patients.20−23 Authors of a recent study suggest that because bacterial type-II
topoisomerases (similar to topoisomerase IV) are targeted by fluoroquinolones,
the mitochondrial dysfunction implicated in some adverse events may
be explained by interactions between fluoroquinolones and human topoisomerase
IIα or IIβ in mitochondria.19 To that end, the authors provided evidence that at 80 μg/mL,
ciprofloxacin may impair mtDNA replication.19 The authors also suggest that the effects on mitochondrial DNA replication
are likely to be mediated by topoisomerase IIβ.19

Although the above study provides an interesting
hypothesis, the
only fluoroquinolone for which data were presented was ciprofloxacin.
Additionally, very little data were provided to demonstrate whether
this compound had a direct activity on human topoisomerase IIα
or IIβ. Other studies in recent years have focused on human
topoisomerase IIα and on either ciprofloxacin or moxifloxacin.24 Therefore, we set out to examine the activity
of a series of fluoroquinolones at clinically relevant concentrations
against both human topoisomerase IIα and IIβ.

Using
a series of enzymological assays, we demonstrate that fluoroquinolones
display a variable impact against human topoisomerase IIα and
IIβ. For example, none of the compounds appeared to significantly
increase the DNA cleavage with human topoisomerase IIα or IIβ,
which suggests that these compounds do not mimic anticancer agents
such as etoposide against the human enzymes. However, at higher drug
concentrations, some fluoroquinolones, including gemifloxacin and
ciprofloxacin, display inhibitory activity against human topoisomerase
II-mediated DNA relaxation. A metabolite of ciprofloxacin also impacts
topoisomerase II-mediated DNA relaxation, which indicates that some
metabolites have activity against human enzymes. However, these in
vitro effects are only seen at drug concentrations that are considerably
more than an order of magnitude higher than the maximal patient plasma
concentrations observed for the compounds. Thus, we propose that it
is highly unlikely that patients experience high levels of drug required
to see inhibition of human topoisomerase IIα and IIβ.
Taken together, we hypothesize that while human topoisomerase II isoforms
may have a role in fluoroquinolone toxicity, there are likely other
targets also involved that need to be identified to find ways to protect
patients from these serious toxicities.

Results and Discussion
Fluoroquinolones
Do Not Increase DNA Cleavage by Human Topoisomerase
IIα or IIβ
For the current study, we selected
three clinically used fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin,
and moxifloxacin) along with one agent that has been removed from
the market (gemifloxacin) and the original quinolone, nalidixic acid
(Figure 1). To examine
the impact of fluoroquinolones on human type-II topoisomerases, we
performed a series of DNA cleavage assays. In these assays, purified
topoisomerase IIα or IIβ is combined with a negatively
supercoiled plasmid substrate (pBR322). The DNA cleavage is monitored
by observing nicked and linearized plasmid molecules in an agarose
gel. A previous study has shown that ciprofloxacin increases DNA cleavage
by topoisomerase IV.25

Figure 1 Structures of quinolones.
The precursor quinolone, nalidixic acid,
along with four prominent fluoroquinolones.

As seen in Figure 2, etoposide leads to an increase in both DNA nicks [single-strand
break (SSB)] and DSBs. Drug concentrations for ciprofloxacin between
3 and 30 μM (∼1–10 μg/mL, see Table 1) are expected in patient serum
samples; therefore, we tested a range up to 300 μM to determine
whether there would be an effect on the enzyme. As seen from the quantified
data, none of the fluoroquinolones caused a significant increase in
DNA cleavage with either isoforms of topoisomerase II (Figure 2, lower panel). This finding
is consistent with the previous data on ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin
from human enzymes.24 The nonfluorinated
quinolone, nalidixic acid, also did not cause a significant increase
in DNA cleavage. The lack of an increase in DNA cleavage supports
the hypothesis that these agents do not act similar to an etoposide
on human topoisomerase II, which prevents the enzyme from ligating
cleaved DNA. This mechanism is referred to as “poisoning”
and is found among several anticancer agents including etoposide.14 However, there are other agents that affect
human topoisomerases without poisoning the DNA cleavage.16 Therefore, we explored the ability of fluoroquinolones
to inhibit supercoiled DNA relaxation activity of the enzymes to determine
whether they function as catalytic inhibitors of human topoisomerase
IIα or IIβ.

Some Fluoroquinolones Inhibit Topoisomerase
II-Mediated DNA
Relaxation at High Concentrations
We also examined the ability
of fluoroquinolones to impair the relaxation of negatively supercoiled
pBR322 plasmid using the same concentration series as used in the
DNA cleavage experiments. In the presence of ATP, human topoisomerase
IIα and IIβ relax the plasmid, which is seen in Figure 3 by the conversion
of supercoiled (SC) plasmid to relaxed (Rel) plasmid in the second
lane (+T). Among the fluoroquinolones, the inhibition of relaxation
is seen at concentrations around 300 μM only with gemifloxacin
and ciprofloxacin. Interestingly, gemifloxacin was able to completely
inhibit relaxation by 300 μM with both enzyme isoforms. Ciprofloxacin
was only able to mildly inhibit relaxation at the same concentration,
which is evidenced by the presence of lower DNA bands (topoisomers).

IIβ in the presence of selected quinolones. Plasmid DNA was
incubated with ATP in the absence (−T) or presence (+T) of
topoisomerase IIα (Top2A, top gel) or β (Top2B, bottom

acid (NA), moxifloxacin (Moxi), gemifloxacin (Gemi), ciprofloxacin
(Cipro), or levofloxacin (Levo). Positions of relaxed (Rel) and supercoiled
(SC) plasmid are shown at left. Representative gels are shown, and
experiments were performed at least three times.

To further test the impact on relaxation, an additional series
was performed at a range of drug concentrations from 10 to 300 μM
with gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and a metabolite of ciprofloxacin,
desethylene ciprofloxacin.26 Even though
fluoroquinolones are active as administered, they do undergo metabolism,
and we explored whether this metabolite displayed activity against
human topoisomerase II. As seen in Figure 4A, ciprofloxacin and desethylene-ciprofloxacin
display limited ability to inhibit relaxation below 200–300
μM. The impact of ciprofloxacin in the 200–300 μM
range is consistent with the recently reported results at 80 μg/mL,
which corresponds to ∼217 μM.19 In contrast, gemifloxacin displays a significant inhibition of relaxation
at 50–100 μM with complete inhibition by 200 μM.

(Cipro), or desethylene-ciprofloxacin (D-Cipro). Positions of relaxed

Error bars represent the standard deviation of three or more independent

Although fluoroquinolones
are shown to act as poisons (i.e., stabilize
DNA cleavage) with bacterial type-II topoisomerases, they do not display
the same ability against human type-II topoisomerases in the concentration
ranges tested. As seen above, gemifloxacin does not poison either
human isoform but is able to inhibit relaxation by both enzymes at
>50 μM. This suggests that the mechanism of fluoroquinolone-induced
inhibition for human enzymes is not the same as the mechanism seen
with bacterial enzymes, which will be discussed further below. There
are catalytic inhibitors of human type-II topoisomerases that block
enzyme functions without stabilizing DNA cleavage.14,27,28 These often involve interactions with the
ATPase domain, but they are not necessarily limited to that mechanism.
Additional studies of gemifloxacin will be required to determine the
mechanism behind the inhibition of human topoisomerase IIα and
IIβ. Because gemifloxacin has been removed from the market,
we did not pursue additional characterization of this compound against
human enzymes.

Desethylene-Ciprofloxacin Does Not Poison
Human Topoisomerase
IIα or IIβ
To examine whether desethylene-ciprofloxacin
(Figure 4B) could serve
as a poison of human topoisomerase II, we performed DNA cleavage assays
with this compound. As seen in Figure 4C, desethylene-ciprofloxacin does not increase double-stranded
DNA cleavage by human topoisomerase IIα or IIβ even in
the presence of 300 μM of the compound. The same results were
observed at lower desethylene-ciprofloxacin concentrations (data not
shown).

Although these results clarify that fluoroquinolones
can have an impact on the overall catalytic activity of human topoisomerase
IIα and IIβ, it is unclear whether the concentrations
observed are clinically relevant. To that end, Table 1 summarizes both the results from plasmid
DNA relaxation in a purified system discussed above and plasma concentrations
reported in the package inserts for these drugs.29−32 As seen in Table 1, gemifloxacin at 24 μg/mL and above
is expected to have a significant impact on relaxation, which implies
there would be a lower impact at concentrations below this level.
Conversely, ciprofloxacin and desethylene-ciprofloxacin would not
be expected to have a significant impact on relaxation until levels
above 74–110 μg/mL. As seen in Table 1, maximum plasma concentrations fall in the
1–10 μg/mL range. Plasma concentrations of these compounds
would need to be 15–100-fold higher, depending on the fluoroquinolone,
to observe an impact on topoisomerase II activity. These data indicate
that the majority of patients treated with fluoroquinolones are highly
unlikely to achieve plasma concentrations of these drugs that are
high enough to cause significant disruption of topoisomerase II activity.

Another observation is in order regarding these data. Structural
and biochemical studies of the binding site of fluoroquinolones on
topoisomerase IV indicate that a critical enzyme/drug interaction
occurs that involves a metal-ion bridge.33,34 According to the data, this interaction involves two key residues
in the bacterial enzymes.33,34 An invariant Ser (sometimes
Thr) and Asp/Glu are found in GyrA and ParC/GrlA, which are subunits
of the heterotetrameric (A2:B2) structure of
DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, respectively. Absence of these residues
can contribute to the resistance to the poisoning of bacterial topoisomerases
by fluoroquinolones. This enzyme/drug interaction mechanism is also
supported by biochemical evidence with DNA gyrase, which suggests
that this is a generalized mechanism for bacterial type-II topoisomerases.35,36

As seen in Figure 5, these residues are shared among representative bacterial
species
that are known to be susceptible to fluoroquinolones. As has been
pointed out previously, human type-II topoisomerases lack these residues.24 To this end, Aldred et al. demonstrated that
mutations at these positions in human topoisomerase IIα render
this isoform susceptible to poisoning by ciprofloxacin.24 Thus, based on sequence analysis, we would not
expect wild-type human topoisomerase IIα and IIβ to be
poisoned by fluoroquinolones if the mechanism of poisoning uses the
same interactions and metal-ion bridges found in bacterial enzymes.
Our data demonstrate among a group of clinically approved agents that
human topoisomerase IIα and IIβ are not poisoned by these
compounds, as predicted by the analysis of the amino acid sequence
data.

to quinolones. Highlighted in red are the positions of the Ser and
Asp/Glu residues. Shown are sequences for DNA Gyrase GyrA and topoisomerase
IV ParC/GrlA subunits from Escherichia coli (Ec), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), Streptococcus pneumonia (Sp), Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (Pa), and Haemophilus influenza (Hi). Also shown are sequences for Homo sapiens topoisomerase II (hTIIα and hTIIβ), which lack the residues
involved in the quinolone salt bridge.

Conclusions
Fluoroquinolones represent an important
class of widely prescribed
pharmaceuticals with a broad range of activity in both Gram-positive
and Gram-negative infections. Unfortunately, a small percentage of
patients experience severe adverse reactions to these agents including
but not limited to peripheral neuropathies, tendon rupture, heart
rhythm abnormalities, and various mental health side effects, as discussed
above. Evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction may play a
role in some of these events such as the neuropathies and issues related
to muscles.20−23 To that end, it has been proposed that fluoroquinolone-mediated
disruption of human topoisomerase IIα and IIβ, which are
present in the mitochondria, could be contributing to these toxicities.19

On the basis of the evidence we have provided
using three clinically
relevant fluoroquinolones, we were unable to observe an impact on
human topoisomerase IIα or IIβ at clinically relevant
drug concentrations. Our results are consistent with a recent study
that indicated that human topoisomerase IIα and β can
be inhibited by 80 μg/mL ciprofloxacin, which as they demonstrate
could lead to disruption of mitochondrial DNA replication.19 Given the high concentration used in this previous
study, it is unlikely that patients will achieve sufficient drug levels
given the clinical data to have this type of impact on topoisomerase
II in the mitochondria.

The adverse events associated with fluoroquinolones
are significant
and warrant further investigation. Although it is possible that human
topoisomerase IIα and/or IIβ could play a role in fluoroquinolone
adverse events, the evidence presented here suggests that inhibition
of human topoisomerase II is not likely to explain the types of adverse
events observed clinically. Thus, we propose that additional potential
drug targets should be identified and explored. For example, previous
studies demonstrating increased reactive oxygen species and decreased
mitochondrial protein expression in response to fluoroquinolones provide
valuable leads for identifying targets in humans cells.22,37 Therefore, efforts to study these adverse events should focus on
identifying other enzymes and pathways impacted by these compounds.

Methods
Enzymes
and Materials
Wild-type human topoisomerase
II (TOP2A) and IIβ (TOP2B) were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae JEL1top1 cells and purified
as described previously.28 Both enzymes
contain a C-terminal His-tag for purification purposes. The enzymes
were stored at −80 °C as a 1 mg/mL (4 μM for wild
type) stock in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1 mM EDTA, 750 mM KCl, 5%
glycerol, and <40 μM dithiothreitol (DTT) (carried from the
enzyme preparation).

Negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA was prepared
from E. coli using a Plasmid Mega Kit
(Qiagen) with some modification of the manufacturer’s protocol.
Etoposide (Sigma) and quinolones (Cayman Chemical and LKT) were stored
at 4 °C as 20 or 30 mM stock solutions in 100% DMSO, respectively.

Topoisomerase IIα-Mediated Relaxation of Plasmid DNA
Reaction mixtures contained 22 nM wild-type topoisomerase IIα,
5 nM negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA, and 1 mM ATP in 20 μL
of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 175 mM KCl, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA,
5 mM MgCl2, and 2.5% glycerol. Assays were started by the
addition of enzyme, and DNA relaxation mixtures were incubated for
15 min at 37 °C. DNA relaxation reactions were carried out in
the presence of 1% DMSO (control), etoposide, or increasing concentrations
of fluoroquinolones. DNA relaxation was stopped by the addition of
3 μL of stop solution (77.5 mM Na2EDTA, 0.77% SDS).
Samples were mixed with 2 μL of agarose gel-loading buffer,
heated for 2 min at 45 °C, and subjected to gel electrophoresis
in 1% TBE agarose gels. The agarose gel was then stained in ethidium
bromide for 15–30 min. DNA bands were visualized by UV light
using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP Imaging System and Image Lab Software
(Hercules, CA). DNA relaxation was monitored by the conversion of
supercoiled plasmid DNA to relaxed topoisomers.

Topoisomerase
IIα-Mediated Cleavage of Plasmid DNA
Plasmid DNA cleavage
reactions were performed using the procedure
of Fortune and Osheroff.38 Reaction mixtures
contained 150 nM of wild-type TOP2A or TOP2B and 5 nM negatively supercoiled
pBR322 DNA in 20 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 1
mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 2.5% glycerol. Final reaction
mixtures contained <1 μM DTT, which represents the residual
DTT carried along from the enzyme preparation. Unless stated otherwise,
assays were started by the addition of enzyme, and DNA cleavage mixtures
were incubated for 6 min at 37 °C. DNA cleavage reactions were
carried out in the absence of compound (1% DMSO solution as a control)
or in the presence of etoposide, or increasing concentrations of fluoroquinolones
DNA cleavage complexes were trapped by the addition of 2 μL
of 5% SDS followed by 2 μL of 250 mM Na2EDTA, pH
8.0. Proteinase K was added (2 μL of a 0.8 mg/mL solution),
and reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to digest
topoisomerase IIα. Samples were mixed with 2 μL of agarose
gel loading buffer (60% sucrose in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), heated
for 2 min at 45 °C, and subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose
gels in 40 mM Trisacetate, pH 8.3, and 2 mM EDTA containing 0.5 μg/mL
ethidium bromide. Double-stranded DNA cleavage was monitored by the
conversion of negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA to linear molecules.
DNA bands were visualized by UV light and quantified using a Bio-Rad
ChemiDoc MP Imaging System and Image Lab Software (Hercules, CA).
Results were plotted using GraphPad Prism 6 (La Jolla, CA). The relative
DNA cleavage was calculated by setting the DNA cleavage levels in
the presence of DMSO to 1.
