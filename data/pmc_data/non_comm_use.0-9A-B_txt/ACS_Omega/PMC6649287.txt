Many
aspects of nanostructured materials at high pressures are
still unexplored. We present here, high-pressure structural behavior
of two Zn2SnO4 nanomaterials with inverse spinel
type, one a particle with size of ∼7 nm [zero dimensional (0-D)]
and the other with a chain-like [one dimensional (1-D)] morphology.
We performed in situ micro-Raman and synchrotron X-ray diffraction
measurements and observed that the cation disordering of the 0-D nanoparticle
is preserved up to ∼40 GPa, suppressing the reported martensitic
phase transformation. On the other hand, an irreversible phase transition
is observed from the 1-D nanomaterial into a new and dense high-pressure
orthorhombic CaFe2O4-type structure at ∼40
GPa. The pressure-treated 0-D and 1-D nanomaterials have distinct
diffuse reflectance and emission properties. In particular, a heterojunction
between the inverse spinel and quenchable orthorhombic phases allows
the use of 1-D Zn2SnO4 nanomaterials as efficient
photocatalysts as shown by the degradation of the textile pollutant
methylene blue.

Introduction
The distinct behaviors
of nanostructured materials from those of
their bulk counterparts are the prime motivation behind research on
nanomaterials in various fields.1−5 The interplay among particle sizes of the building blocks in the
nanoregime, the different atomic structures, and the surface and interfacial
properties of the grains are the deciding factors in the distinctive
functional behavior of nanomaterials.6−8 In the pursuit of new
phenomena in nanomaterials, high pressure has been employed recently
to modify the atomic arrangements and interactions of materials.9−14 Understanding the pressure-induced structural stability of various
types of nanomaterials and the concomitant tuning of their physicochemical
properties is important from both a fundamental and application point
of view.

Over the past few decades, semiconducting nanomaterials
of different
types and structures have greatly contributed to significant progress
in nanoscience and technology due to their salient and flexible opto-electronic,
photonic, magnetic, and mechanical features.15−19 As far as the exploration of semiconducting nanomaterials
under high pressure is concerned, studies on a variety of materials,
namely, the group (IV) elements C, Si, and their compound SiC; group
(II–VI) compounds such as ZnS, ZnSe, CdS, CdSe, and CdTe; group
(IV–VI) PbS; group (III–V) GaN and AlN; the superhard
material, BC2N; binary oxides such as TiO2,
ZnO, SnO2, Fe2O3, and CeO2; the rare-earth oxide, Ho2O3; wide band-gap
oxides such as β-Ga2O3 and Y2O3; p-type compounds including CuO, CoO, and MnS; n-type
BaTiO3; and narrow band-gap layered group (V–VI)
semiconductors such as Bi2Te3, have been performed.9,10,12,14,20−38 Most of these studies have shed light on the interesting kinetics
of pressure-induced first-order, solid–solid structural transformations,
compressibilities, bulk moduli, and stiffness or hardness of the materials.23−31 The thermodynamics of phase transformations and relative stabilities
of the phases have also been noted in several studies.24−26,30−33 Although there are conflicting
trends in the reported transition pressures relating to the Hall–Petch
effect that is found as bulk materials are reduced to smaller crystallites,
a significant influence from nanosized particles or grains has been
commonly suggested as the cause for the dissimilar types of nucleation,
growth dynamics, phase transition pathways, and even sequences of
the phase transitions or amorphizations of semiconducting materials
under high pressure.31,32,34,35 A specific size, at which the typical nanoscale
effects start to occur in materials, has also been defined as their
respective “critical size” in several cases.27,32,34 The contributions of the nanoscale-induced
differences in the surface energies of the relevant phases mainly
account for the stabilities of the corresponding structures.24,33 In this context, the impacts of various microstructural features,
for instance, the distinct shape or morphology, dimension, and homogeneity,
of the materials are often found to coincide with the size effects
of the nanocrystals in many studies.9,14,33,36−39 The microstructure-induced strains appearing at the contact points
of the grains of the materials may cause significant structural distortions,
which also contribute to the transition pressure and phase stability.8,14

In the present study, the simultaneous effects of the size
and
microstructure have been investigated on the high-pressure phase transition
of a specially designed ZnO–SnO2-based multi-cation
oxide, Zn2SnO4. The wide band gap, n-type semiconducting
Zn2SnO4 is highly acclaimed as a potential candidate
for various applications, such as dye-sensitized solar cells, transparent
conducting oxides, photocatalytic degradation, humidity and combustible
gas sensing, and Li-ion batteries.40−43 However, the high-pressure behavior
of this important material has hardly been explored. A single theoretical
study by Gracia et al. highlighted the structural, electronic, and
optical properties of bulk Zn2SnO4.44 Based on their work, the pressure-induced phase
transition of spinel Zn2SnO4 to orthorhombic
phases was identified to be of the CaTi2O4 (titanite-type)
and CaFe2O4 (ferrite-type) structures at 39
and 54 GPa, respectively, and then the Sr2PbO4 structure at higher pressure. Shen et al., first experimentally
detected the formation of an orthorhombic, ambient pressure CaFe2O4-like structure at ∼32 GPa through an
intermediate orthorhombic phase at ∼13 GPa in Zn2SnO4 nanowires with a diameter of approximately 150 nm.45 In a separate study, an entirely different phase
transition from the cubic to hexagonal phase at ∼30 GPa for
single-crystal Zn2SnO4 having a tetrakaidecahedral
morphology and an average particle size of 800 nm was reported by
Zhang et al.11 They also mentioned a variation
in the electrical resistance due to a reduction of the Zn2SnO4 micrograins to nanocrystals of approximately 5 nm
at ∼13 GPa, where remarkably, no structural transition was
observed. Therefore, the variety of the observed properties, even
in these very limited number of studies, unequivocally motivated us
to further study the high-pressure behavior of this semiconducting
oxide with distinct sizes and microstructures. “Zero”
dimensional (0-D) nanoparticles, with a size of ∼7 nm, as well
as unique “one” dimensional (1-D), dense, and elongated
Zn2SnO4 nanostructures, with an average grain
width of ∼100 nm, have been used in this study. Both samples
were characterized before and after the pressure treatments based
on their optical properties and efficiencies for photocatalytic degradation
of the well-known textile dye methylene blue (MB).

The ternary
oxide, Zn2SnO4, which has cubic
(Fd3m) symmetry, belongs to the
(A2+)[B4+A2+]O4-type inverse
spinel oxides in the bulk state, where half of the A cations populate
the tetrahedral sites and the other half occupy the octahedral sites
along with all of the B cations.46 Several
spinel oxides possess complicated disordering phenomena involving
the redistribution of cations A and B over the tetrahedrally and octahedrally
coordinated sites. There have been reports claiming a significant
role of this cation reordering in spinel oxides with regard to the
structural stability and diffusional or diffusionless phase transformations
at high temperatures.47−49 Few studies have highlighted a similar phenomenon
for several bulk spinel oxides at high pressure.47−49 The Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles with grain sizes of ∼7
nm used in this present study reveal cation disorder. Therefore, this
represents a unique occasion to characterize the phase transformations
associated with cation reordering of a nanosized inverse spinel oxide,
which is another important aspect of the present study.

Results and Discussion
Microstructural
and Optical Characterizations of the Samples
under Ambient Conditions
A bright field transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image of the hydrothermally synthesized Zn2SnO4 sample dispersed in ethanol is presented in Figure 1a. The high-resolution
image shows the monodispersed spherical particles with sizes of less
than 10 nm in all dimensions. The particles are marked with yellow
dotted lines for a clear demarcation. At the same time, the 0-D nanoparticles
are found to be aggregated in the final Zn2SnO4 sample studied here as revealed by the high-angle annular dark-field-scanning
TEM (HAADF-STEM) images in Figure 1b. As a consequence, a moderate surface area of ∼36.71
m2/g was obtained for the Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles prepared by the hydrothermal method from the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) analysis. In addition, the characteristic type-III isotherm
that is observed in the N2 adsorption–desorption
studies (Figure 1c)
along with an insignificant pore size distribution (PSD) as calculated
by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method (Figure 1c, inset) further
support the nonporous nature and compactness of the nanoparticles
of the Zn2SnO4 sample.

Figure 1 (a) TEM and (b) STEM
image of the 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles, (d)
STEM and (e) TEM image of the 1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures,
and (c,f) N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of the 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles and
1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures, respectively. The
insets exhibit their PSDs.

The Zn2SnO4 sample prepared from the
temperature-assisted
solid-state reaction between ZnO and SnO2 appears to have
a self-assembled elongated chain-like unique morphology. The STEM
image of a small unit of the typical chain-like particles of Zn2SnO4 and the TEM image that includes several similar
particles assembled together are displayed in Figure 1d,e, respectively. The actual width of the
individual chain-like particles measured considering only their nonoverlapping
sections varies over the range of 50–100 nm (marked with yellow
double arrows). The dark contrast in both the STEM and TEM images
of the 1-D particles indicates that the Zn2SnO4 nanostructures formed by the solid-state method are highly dense
in nature and have no Kirkendall pores.41 This, again, is supported by the type-III N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm exhibited by the dense Zn2SnO4 nanostructures
(Figure 1f). The BET
surface area obtained from the sample was found to be very low at
∼4.23 m2/g. However, the BJH PSD, shown in the inset
of Figure 1f, contrarily
reveals the presence of pores with a wide distribution of sizes varying
from ∼5 to ∼60 nm even in these dense Zn2SnO4 nanostructures. The intergrain voids (marked with
red arrows) among the chain-like particles assembled with each other,
and that assembly should be the only source of introducing meso- to
microporosity in the sample (Figure 1e), which makes this particular morphology more exceptional
for studying at high pressure.41,43

The order–disorder
phenomena in the local structures of
the samples were verified using HAADF-STEM real-space imaging. A high-resolution
HAADF-STEM image from the 1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures
viewed along the (100) direction is displayed in Figure 2a. The inverse-spinel crystal
structure of Zn2SnO4 (x, y, z = 1 unit) that is superimposed on
the experimental HAADF-STEM image matches with the Z-sensitive contrast of the Zn and Sn columns that define the ordered
distribution of Zn2+ and Sn4+ over the lattice
sites (Figure 2a, inset).
The sites with brighter contrast in the image, marked with yellow
balls, correspond to the Sn atoms, which have a higher atomic number
(Z) compared to Zn, and the sites of the Zn atoms
are marked with red balls. In contrast, the HAADF-STEM image of the
0-D nanoparticles showed significantly lower contrast. This interesting
phenomenon suggests a lack of ordering between the Zn and Sn sites
in the hydrothermally synthesized Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles.
The possibility of a redistribution of Zn2+ and Sn4+ in the octahedral and tetrahedral crystal sites of the inverse
spinel Zn2SnO4 is considered, in this regard,
as an effect of the reduction of particle size because we have <10
nm particle sizes.46 The imperfect alignment
of the Zn and Sn columns as related to the aforementioned disorder
may lead to the low contrast observed in the HAADF image.46,51,52 The distorted local structure
of this particular 0-D nanosized Zn2SnO4 was
further confirmed from its unusual Raman phonon A1g(2)
mode at ∼626 cm–1, which is the characteristic
vibrational mode for a nonequilibrium cation distribution in the inverse
spinel structure (Figure 2c).46,50 The other Raman active bands
seen in Figure 2c can
be attributed to the A1g(1), F2g(3), F2g(2), Eg, and F2g(1) symmetries of the typical
inverse spinel structure of Zn2SnO4 and appeared
at similar positions for both samples.41,46 The measured
ratio of the intensity of the F2g(2) and F2g(3) bands of the 1-D nanoparticles with peaks at ∼529 and
559 cm–1 is 1.3:1. However, the same with an inverse
intensity order (F2g(2)/F2g(3) = 1:1.042) indicates
the possibility of higher [B] site populations of Zn2+ instead
of Sn4+ in the 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles.46 Moreover, the exceptionally broad Raman spectral
lines further suggest that the 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanospinel
has a deformed MeO6 octahedra as well as MeO4 tetrahedra (Me = Zn or Sn).46 To eliminate
the likelihood of any chemical disorder in this case, the chemical
compositions of the samples were compared with a reported mixture
of ZnO and SnO2 at a ratio of 2:1, based on the X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. It is worth mentioning that the Zn 2p3/2 spectra of both Zn2SnO4 samples studied
here are found to be nearly identical to that of the standard mixture
with respect to the positions of their binding energies (∼1020.92,
∼1020.91, and ∼1021.4 eV for the 0-D nanoparticles,
1-D nanostructures and the standard mixture, respectively) and symmetric
spectral shapes, as represented in the inset of Figure 2c.46 This elucidates
that the samples, even though synthesized by different methods, are
chemically homogeneous with an atomic ratio of 2 for Zn to Sn. The
XPS investigation also confirms the influence of no chemical disorder
on the nonuniform structure of the 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles.

Sn sites, (C,D) Raman spectrum and DR spectrum of (a) 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles and (b) 1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures, respectively. Inset of (C,D) represents the XPS
and emission spectra of each, respectively.

Therefore, based on the HAADF, Raman, and XPS analyses, it
can
be stated that, while the 1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures
have the inverse spinel structure, the cation distribution in the
0-D nanoparticles have a partially inverse spinel structure with the
chemical formula (ZnδSn1−δ)tet[SnδZn2−δ]octO4, where the value of the inversion parameter,
“δ” is between 0 and 1.46 A decrease in the optical band gap from ∼3.85 to ∼3.51
eV was estimated from the redshifted absorption edge in the diffuse
reflectance (DR) of the 0-D nanoparticles compared to that of the
1-D nanostructures yet having the larger particle sizes, as exhibited
in the inset of Figure 2d. This observation corroborates the first principles study performed
by Wei et al. on the anomalous band gap reduction as a function of
the cation inversion for SnBII2O4-type spinel oxides, such as Zn2SnO4.53 The emission properties of the as-prepared samples
were measured thereafter (Figure 2d, inset). The emission maxima appeared at ∼328
nm for the 1-D nanostructures, whereas that for the 0-D nanoparticles
shifted to the mid-UVA region at ∼358 nm. The observed emissions
of both Zn2SnO4 samples refer to their intraband
electron transitions only.

0-D Zn2SnO4 Nanoparticles
under High Pressure:
Effects of Size
The pressure-induced structural behavior
of the 0-D nanosized Zn2SnO4 accompanying the
nonequilibrium structure was investigated by in situ Raman and X-ray
diffraction (XRD) studies. Based on earlier reports, we anticipated
an order–disorder-mediated structural transformation in these
studies. Therefore, the variation in the relative intensities of the
A1g(2) (red shaded area, Figure 3a) and F2g(2) modes versus that
of the F2g(3) mode was monitored at elevated pressures
as shown in Figure 3b. The impact of high pressure on cation reordering was negligible
because there is no significant pressure-dependent change in the intensity
of the A1g(2) peak. The F2g(2)/F2g(3) ratio remained almost constant as well, up to ∼40 GPa,
after a minute initial enhancement at ∼8–10 GPa. The
F2g(2) and F2g(3) peaks obtained by multipeak
fitting of the Raman spectrum at ambient, ∼10 and ∼37
GPa are displayed in the inset of Figure 3b. An indisputable stress arises to make
more compact contact between the spherical nanograins and may have
induced some disorder at lower pressure (also discussed later). However,
unperturbed structural disorder under high pressure usually leads
to a martensitic phase transformation through a diffusionless mechanism,
which should promote the possibility of a faster phase transition
in spinel structures, such as Zn2SnO4.47−49 In contrast, no salient modification in the Raman modes indicating
a new phase are observed for the sample up to ∼40 GPa, except
for a regular shift of the bands toward higher frequencies (Figure 3a). This exceptional
behavior of the 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles is
further confirmed by the XRD patterns shown in Figure 3c, which exhibit only a systematic pressure-induced
shift in the 2θ values toward higher angles along with certain
peak broadening. A significantly high bulk modulus (B0) of ∼241.52(2) GPa can be determined, thereafter,
using the second-order Birch–Murnaghan equation of state, where K0′ is fixed at 4 (Figure 3d).12 Therefore,
the 0-D small ∼7 nm particles are stable and do not undergo
a martensitic transformation. This study introduces diffusionless
cation reordering as an important size effect during the pressure-induced
phase transformation of this spinel oxide. Further studies are underway
to determine whether there is any “critical size” for
the Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles, where the cation
disorder in the structure persists, while at the same time influencing
either the diffusional or diffusionless phase transformation at higher
pressures.

1-D Zn2SnO4 Nanostructures
under High
Pressure: Effects of Morphology
The pressure-dependent structural
transformation of the 1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures
with an elongated chain-like morphology was explored using the same
pressure range of up to ∼40 GPa. Interestingly, two successive
modifications of the inverse spinel structure of the sample at ambient
conditions (space group: Fd3m; calculated
lattice parameter: a = 8.66(1) Å) can be seen
in the XRD patterns as a function of pressure, shown in Figure 4A. (The small impurities of
ZnO (square shaped mark) and SnO2 (round shaped mark) are
not considered in the analysis). First, a splitting of the diffraction
peak corresponding to the (400) plane into two peaks was found to
begin at ∼10 GPa, which can be attributed to a tetragonal distortion
of the cubic inverse spinel structure. The lattice parameters calculated
by whole-profile fitting of the corresponding XRD pattern are a = 8.58(3) Å and a = b = 6.09(1) Å, c = 8.50(1) Å for the inverse
spinel and tetragonal structures, respectively. The distortion became
stronger with increasing pressure up to ∼26 GPa. The analogous
distortion, albeit ambiguously characterized as an intermediate phase
by Shen et al., was followed by a further phase transition to the
ambient-pressure structure of orthorhombic CaFe2O4 at ∼32 GPa for the Zn2SnO4 nanowires
with an average diameter of ∼150 nm.45 Similarly, the onset of a second phase transition can also be observed
at ∼30 GPa for the chain-like Zn2SnO4 with an average width of ∼100 nm, indicating a comparable
surface area-to-volume ratio to that of the Zn2SnO4 nanowires studied by Shen et al.39,45 However, it is worth noting that a new denser high-pressure orthorhombic
CaFe2O4 structure appeared, which is equivalent
to the CaFe2O4 structure that occurred at ∼63
GPa, as reported by Yamanaka et al.54 The
analysis by Yamanaka et al. provides the same Pnma space group symmetry but with a three-fold larger c-axis dimension (c = 8.353(1) Å) for this new
phase compared to that of the orthorhombic CaFe2O4 structures that appear at lower pressures. For instance, the calculated
values for “c” are 2.889(3) and 3.019(2)
Å at ∼42 and 0.0001 GPa, respectively. An identical “c”, 8.448(6) Å corresponding to the new phase,
was obtained in our case for the chain-like Zn2SnO4 nanostructures by whole-profile fitting analysis of the XRD
pattern at ∼30 GPa. The complete transformation into the new
phase (c = 8.347(2)) is found to take place at ∼38
GPa through the gradual disappearance of the tetragonal structure
at ∼32 GPa followed by the inverse spinel structure at ∼34
GPa. The high pressure phase of the orthorhombic CaFe2O4-type structure is quenchable and exhibits an irreversible
phase transition even after releasing the pressure. The normalized
unit cell volumes of the consecutive phases are shown in Figure 4C. The whole-profile
fitting of the selective XRD patterns mentioned above are represented
in Figure S1a–d. To the extent of
our knowledge, this is the first observation of the transformation
of the inverse spinel structure of Zn2SnO4 into
a much denser high-pressure CaFe2O4-type structure.

strains for (a) 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles and
(b) 1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures.

The pressure-induced phase transformations observed
from the XRD
analysis of the elongated chain-like Zn2SnO4 nanostructures were further verified by in situ Raman spectroscopic
study (Figure 4B).
Primarily, a substantial shift can be observed for the five first-order
Raman active modes, A1g(1), F2g(3), F2g(2), Eg, and F2g(1), representing the cubic
inverse spinel structure of Zn2SnO4 in the Fd3m space group to higher frequencies
as the pressure was increased to ∼9 GPa. A distinctive broadening
of all three F2g and Eg modes is observed at
∼11 GPa. This evidence supports a breaking of the degeneracy
by the transformation of F2g into (B2g + Eg) and Eg into (A1g + B1g)
modes, the characteristic Raman modes of the lower-symmetry tetragonal
structure of the I41/amd space group.45,55 Similar to the XRD results, the
bands corresponding to the tetragonal phase became more intense up
to ∼26 GPa. The appearance of a broad band with maxima at ∼725
cm–1 along with the broadening of the other bands,
mainly the Eg (tetragonal) band, confirm a further lowering
of the symmetry and the onset of the orthorhombic CaFe2O4-type structure of the Pnma space group
at ∼28 GPa, whereas complete conversion into the purely orthorhombic
phase occurred at ∼36 GPa.45,55 The Raman
study comprehensively confirms the XRD analysis, whereas the recovered
sample also exhibits the residual modes of the orthorhombic CaFe2O4-type structure (Figure 4D). However, it has not escaped our notice
that an unusual mode at ∼790 cm–1, marked
with round shape, can be observed in the recovered sample, which might
be a result of the partial disorder in the sample (Figure 4D).48

First, formation of the high-pressure orthorhombic CaFe2O4-type structure, yet having a comparable cohesive
energy
to that in the previous study, followed by disordering in the structure
highlights the involvement of a high amount of strain during the pressure-induced
phase transformation of the 1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures.
The typical chain-like grains, which have several uneven inter grain
voids (as depicted from the TEM image and BET study in Figure 1e,f), may induce extreme stress
at the contact points among the grains.8,14 The inhomogeneous
distribution of the stress with increasing pressure and the consequent
microstrain developed at the grain boundaries are considered to play
a crucial role in the phase transformation pathway of the Zn2SnO4 nanostructures.8 In this
regard, the pressure-induced evolution of the microscopic strain based
on the major (311) diffraction peak of the inverse spinel phase is
also determined for the 1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures
using the Stokes–Wilson equation12 and is compared with that of the 0-D nanoparticles having a nonporous
and compact distribution of spherical particles mentioned earlier
(Figure 4E). After
an initial densification, the strain remained almost homogeneous for
the 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles. In contrast,
a much higher strain, which constantly increased with pressure and
reached a maximum value at the onset pressure of the orthorhombic
CaFe2O4 phase at ∼28 GPa, can be seen
for the Zn2SnO4 sample having a chain-like morphology.
A similar trend in the microstrain was also observed based on the
(111), (220), (511), and (440) diffraction planes, as represented
in Figure S2. The notable jump in the microstrain
at ∼10 GPa (Figures 4E and S2) may be attributed to
grain refinement of the chain-like Zn2SnO4 nanostructures,
similar to that reported by Zhang et al.11

Optical Characteristics of the Recovered Samples: Comparison
of Their Photocatalytic Activities
The pressure-dependent
modifications of the Zn2SnO4 samples were further
isolated by successive verification of their band gaps and emission
properties after the pressure was released. Only a small blueshift
of ∼10 nm was found in the absorption edge of the DR spectrum
and, accordingly, in the emission maxima of the recovered 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles (Figure 5A) compared to those of the ambient sample.
This result suggests an extensive effect of the pressure-induced increase
in the direct band gap of the spinel Zn2SnO4 structures, as reported by Gracia et al.44 However, an additional absorption edge of ∼368 nm with a
much lower band gap of ∼3.37 eV was observed for the recovered
1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures along with the inverse
spinel phase, which results in a higher band gap of ∼4.19 eV
compared to the as-prepared sample (∼3.85 eV). The low energy
absorption in this case can be unequivocally considered to originate
from the orthorhombic phase. Interestingly, the broad emission from
the UV to visible region corresponding to this particular sample exhibits
three maxima. An intense peak at ∼311 nm followed by a broad
peak at ∼371 nm can be assigned to the respective band edge
emissions of the inverse spinel and orthorhombic phases. Moreover,
a broad visible band centered at ∼556 nm may originate from
the strain-induced disorder in the chain-like Zn2SnO4 nanostructures, as observed in the Raman spectrum. The as-prepared
Zn2SnO4 samples were compared with their respective
recovered counterparts in regard to their efficiencies as photocatalysts
toward the degradation of a model organic pollutant, MB, under UV
illumination (365 nm, 8 W). The comparative degradation profiles of
the characteristic absorption at 665 nm of MB over time are shown
in Figure 5B, where C0 and C indicate the concentrations
of MB before and after UV exposure, respectively. The rate of photodegradation
efficiency is significantly altered after 35 min of UV irradiation
in the order 1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructuresas prepared (Eg: ∼3.85
eV) < 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticlesrecovered (Eg: ∼3.62 eV) ≈ 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticlesas prepared (Eg: ∼3.51 eV) < 1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructuresrecovered (Eg inverse spinel: ∼4.19 eV; Eg orthorombic: ∼3.37 eV) (Figure S3). The efficiency is, thus, found to vary according
to the suitable band gap energy of the samples with respect to the
light source (Eg ≈ 3.39 eV). Therefore,
a minor downtrend in the degradation efficiencies is observed for
the 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles after the pressure
is released. In contrast, the degradation efficiencies are significantly
enhanced for the recovered Zn2SnO4 nanostructures,
where the heterojunction of the two phases, namely, inverse spinel
(Eg: ∼4.19 eV) and orthorhombic
phase (Eg: ∼3.37 eV), can effectively
reduce the possibility of recombination of the photogenerated electrons
and holes.43 The optical properties and
efficiencies of photocatalytic degradation of the MB dye of the Zn2SnO4 nanomaterials at ambient pressure conditions
and the recovered counterparts after the pressure treatments are assembled
together in Table 1 mentioning their respective crystal structure.

Conclusions
The impacts of the size
and morphology of nanostructured Zn2SnO4 on
their phase transformation behavior were
investigated using 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles
with an average particle size of ∼7 nm and 1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures with a typical chain-like morphology
with several uneven interparticle voids. Unlike previously established
martensitic phase transition of spinel structures, the 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles with an inverse spinel structure
showed no significant pressure-induced structural modification under
high pressure up to ∼40 GPa. On the other hand, an irreversible
phase transformation was observed for the 1-D Zn2SnO4 inverse spinel Zn2SnO4 nanostructures
to form a new quenchable high-pressure orthorhombic CaFe2O4-type structure. The inhomogeneously distributed pressure-induced
strain relating to its distinct morphology is accounted for. Modifications
of the optical band gaps and in emission properties can be seen after
the pressure treatments. The photocatalytic degradation efficiencies
of the original nanoparticles were compared to those of their respective
pressure-recovered counterparts using the organic pollutant, MB. The
pressure-recovered Zn2SnO4 nanostructures that
have a heterojunction between the inverse spinel and the new orthorhombic
phases appeared to be the most efficient photocatalyst.

Experimental
Section
The 0-D Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles
of ∼7
nm size were prepared by the hydrothermal method, the most widely
used technique for synthesizing nanomaterials.50 In contrast, the dense and elongated 1-D Zn2SnO4 nanostructures were prepared by calcining a stoichiometric
mixture of the two presynthesized reactive precursors, namely, ZnO
rod-like microstructures and SnO2 nanoparticles.41 The explicit synthetic techniques for these
precursors are mentioned elsewhere.41,50 The grain
sizes and morphologies of the Zn2SnO4 nanostructures
were examined by TEM analysis on a Tecnai G2 30ST. The HAADF-STEM
images of the samples were taken using a JEOL JEM 2100F equipped with
a CEOS-corrector. The specific surface areas of the samples were measured
using the BET method on a Quantachrome Instrument (iQ3, USA) by nitrogen
adsorption–desorption studies at 77 K, whereas the BJH method
was followed for calculating the PSDs. XPS measurements were carried
out in a PHI 5000 VersaProbe II scanning XPS microprobe (ULVAC-PHI,
U.S.). High-pressure experiments were performed using a symmetric
diamond anvil cell furnished with a pair of type-I diamonds with culet
sizes of 300 μm. A preindented stainless-steel gasket drilled
with a 120 μm diameter hole at the center was used as the sample
chamber, whereas Si oil was used as the pressure transmitting medium.
A small ruby chip was used as the pressure gauge, and the R1-line
emission of the ruby chip was used for pressure calibration during
the measurements. In situ high pressure XRD measurements were conducted
on the 6D beamline at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) using a
monochromatic 18.785 keV X-ray beam (λ = 0.6600 Å) with
a diameter of 100 μm. A charge-coupled device detector was used
for recording the Debye rings, which were further integrated into
1-D profiles using the Fit2D program. In situ high-pressure Raman
measurements were performed by an inVia Raman spectrometer with a
532 nm excitation laser and 2400 g/cm grating at the Center for High
Pressure Science & Technology Advanced Research, Shanghai, China,
keeping the sample conditions similar to those used for the XRD measurements.
The same spectrometer was used to measure the emission spectra of
the samples using a UV laser of wavelength 325 nm (IK3301R-G He–Cd
Laser, K KIMMON) as the excitation source. DR spectra of the samples
were measured on a UV–vis–NIR spectrometer (Shimadzu
UV-3600). For a typical experiment, the photocatalytic activities
of the ambient and released samples were evaluated by measuring the
degradation rate of MB (Merck, Germany) dye solution. An 8 W UV lamp
(UVLS-28 EL Series) with an average light intensity of 0.6 mW/cm2 and an emitting wavelength of 365 nm (UVC, ∼3.39 eV)
was used as the irradiation source in a closed chamber. The dye degradation
under UV light was periodically monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy
(Shimadzu UV-3600).
