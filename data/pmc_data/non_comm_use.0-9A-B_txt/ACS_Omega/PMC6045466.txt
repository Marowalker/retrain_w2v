Introduction
Dopamine (DA) is an
important neurotransmitter in the brain’s
limbic reward system which plays a significant role in functioning
of cardiovascular system, renal and transferring the information to
different parts of brain mainly by the reward-motivated pathway.1,2 The abnormal levels of DA are shown to have a significant effect
on neurological disorders that are linked to Parkinson’s, Schizophrenia,
Alzheimer’s disease, and human immunodeficiency virus pathogenesis.3 Hence, sensitive and selective determination
of the DA level is extremely important for the early diagnosis and
prevention of these diseases for the well-being of human health. For
a healthy individual, DA level lies in the range of 0.01–10
μM.4

Among various techniques
used for the detection of DA, electrochemical
methods are in vogue because of its quick response, high sensitivity
and more importantly, easy electro-oxidation of DA makes it more viable.
However, the coexistence of uric acid (UA) and a high concentration
of ascorbic acid [AA 100–1000 times higher than DA] in the
extracellular fluids of the central nervous system can cause great
interference because of its oxidation potentials which are close to
that of DA on bare electrodes resulting in poor selectivity. Moreover,
the electro-oxidation of DA in the presence of AA results in regeneration
of DA by reducing back the oxidized DA by AA and then reoxidizing
at the electrode surface making the system unreliable.

Hence,
it is of great importance to develop a highly selective
and sensitive probe capable enough to completely knock down the interference
of AA and UA for an efficient and quick therapeutics. Numerous efforts
have been made in eliminating the interference of AA and the selective
detection of DA. For example, transition metal oxides, noble metals,6−8 Ag–Pt/carbon nanofibers,9 boron-doped
diamond electrode,5 peptide nanostructures,10 polymer,11 and functionalized
carbonaceous nanomaterials12 have been
explored. Nevertheless, extremely low concentration of DA in the presence
of high concentration of AA imposes severe limitations for the existing
catalyst materials.

Polyoxometalates (POMs) are high-oxidation-state
transition metaloxide
clusters that have attracted a great attention in numerous applications
toward material science,13 catalyst in
homogeneous and heterogeneous system,14−16 energy storage systems,17 electrocatalysis,18 and medicine.19 It is also used in electrochemical
sensing because of its multielectron redox properties and high stability
without altering the composition; furthermore, its physical properties
can be fine-tuned by varying the cations. A few reports of DA-sensing
by POM are also reported,20,21 but high solubility
in water, lack of selectivity, and poor conductivity restrict its
use in electrochemical sensing of DA. In the present report, we have
explored a novel sandwich POM Na12[WCo3(H2O)2(CoW9O34)2]
(Na12Co5POM), wherein both Co and W metals are
non-noble, cost-effective, ecofriendly and stable in the pH range
of 4.0–8.0. In general, sandwich POMs are more accessible and
are better catalysts than simple keggin POMs. To the best of our knowledge,
this sandwich Co5POM has never been explored in catalysis
or any other applications. Here, we demonstrate an outstanding performance
of Co5POM as a sensor for the detection of DA by using
a conjugate of POM and poly(vinylimidazolium) cation [PVIM+] in combination with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs). Co5POM was supported over NCNTs to enhance the electron transfer
between poorly conductive POMs and the external circuit. However,
NCNTs12 and POM20,21 independently cannot eliminate the interference of AA and UA in
the determination of DA. [PVIM+] was introduced as a cationic
polymer (ionomer) to balance the multinegative charge (−12)
of Co5POM and strongly hold both NCNT and POM while allowing
the uniform distribution over NCNT support. Conductively efficient
heterogenization of Co5POM catalyst by PVIM over NCNTs
provides the synergy between PVIM–POM catalyst and NCNTs as
a conductive support at the electrode/electrolyte interface which
enhances the sensitivity and selectivity toward the electrochemical
detection of DA (Scheme 1) and eliminates the interference of AA at a physiological pH (7.4).

Results and Discussion
Physical
Characterization
In the present study, we
have shown that PVIM–Co5POM conjugate is a stable
catalyst to perform sensitive and selective detection of DA. Our approach
was to improve the conductivity and simultaneously enhanced electron
transfer of novel Co5POM molecular catalyst for a selective
electrochemical detection of DA using PVIM polymer matrix and NCNTs.

The sandwich Na12[Co5POM] was synthesized
under microwave heating and the green-colored crystals was obtained
from recrystallization under slow evaporation of the aqueous mixture
(detailed in Experimental Section). The molecular
structure was analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD)
and is depicted in Figure 1 and Table S3 (Supporting Information, CCDC no. 1558372). As revealed by the molecular structure, three
Co atoms and one W atom formed a cubane which is sandwiched between
two [CoW9O34] Keggin fragments. The molecular
formula of the compound was found to be Na12[WCo3(H2O)2(CoW9O34)2]. Tweleve Na atoms surrounded the Co5POM as counter-cation.
All the W atoms present in the structure are octahedrally surrounded
by O atoms. The Co1 atoms (namely heteroatoms) are tetrahedrally surrounded
by O atoms, whereas the sandwiched Co atoms namely Co2 and Co3 are
in octahedral geometry.

Figure 1 Single-crystal X-ray structure of [WCo3(H2O)2(CoW9O34)2]12–.

The sixth coordination site of each terminal Co atom Co2
is occupied
by O atoms of water molecules. The sandwiched Co and W atoms (Co2,
Co3, and W10) are connected to each other by oxo-bridges. Moreover,
Co3 and W10 atoms are sharing the same sites because of positional
disorder. Further, the detailed crystal parameters of Co5POM (extracted from the SC-XRD analysis) are given in Table S3 (Supporting Information).

The conjugate
of Co5POM and PVIM was prepared using
slight excess of PVIMBr to replace the Na ions in Na12[Co5POM] resulting in a concrete light green solid, where PVIM
acts as a binder. The PVIM–Co5POM/NCNTs composite
was prepared by homogeneously grinding the mixture of PVIM–Co5POM conjugate and NCNTs (70:30 wt%) for 1 h. The resultant
PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT composite was characterized in
detail using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS)
techniques. Additionally, UV–vis and FT-IR spectroscopic studies
were carried out for Co5POM and have been provided as Figures
S3 and S4 (Supporting Information), respectively.
FT-IR analysis shows all the W–O characteristic stretching
frequencies and νC=N (1159 cm–1), slightly shifted to 1164 cm–1 in PVIM–Co5POM/NCNTs composite compared to PVIM–Co5POM conjugate (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The SEM images (Figures 2b and S6, Supporting Information) display the morphology of Co5POM, PVIM–Co5POM conjugate, and PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT composite.
It can be seen from the images that Co5POM displays no
distinguishable structural features and is basically nonconductive
resulted in contrast difference because of the electrostatic charge
accumulation on the surface (Figure S6).
The optical images of Na12Co5POM and PVIM-Co5POM conjugate in Figure S6c (Supporting Information) reveal the dark green crystals, which forms light
green concrete solid after the exchange of cation with PVIM, in which
PVIM acts as a binder. The same aggregation of the PVIM–Co5POM conjugate can be seen in SEM images (Figure S6, Supporting Information). However, after the physical
mixing of NCNTs with PVIM–Co5POM resulted in the
formation of fairly homogeneous layer around the NCNTs (Figure 2).

NCNTs, (b) and (c) PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT composite at
lower and higher magnification, respectively.

The elemental surface composition of PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT composite material investigated using XPS. The XPS survey
scan revealed the presence of carbon (C), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N),
tungsten (W), and cobalt (Co) (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Figure 3a represents C 1s XP spectra of the composite, and the spectra
were deconvoluted into four components. The two main peaks at 284.2
and 285.0 were attributed to sp2-hybridized
graphite-like carbon (C–C sp2) and sp3-hybridized diamond-like carbon (C–C sp3) respectively overlapping with sp2 carbon bound to nitrogen (N–C sp2) present in the NCNTs as well as in PVIM. The peaks
at 286.2 and 288.1 were assigned to carbon–oxygen functional
groups (labeled as C–O, C=O and −COO). The N1s
XP spectra (Figure 3b) exhibits three main peaks, one at the lowest binding energy (398.5
eV) can be attributed to pyridinic nitrogen (N1), the peak at 399.5
eV originates from pyrrolic nitrogen (N2), and the higher binding
energy peak at 400.4 eV assigned to quaternary group (N3) present
in NCNTs and in PVIM. The O 1s shows two peaks at 530.5 and 532.7
eV corresponding to the metaloxide and hydroxyl (−OH) groups
respectively in Co5POM and NCNTs (Figure 3c). The Co 2p spectra in Figure S8 (Supporting Information) shows doublet peaks originating
from Co5POM consisting of Co2p1/2 and Co2p3/2 Co–oxygen bond. The W 4f spectra show doublet peak
originating from Co5POM consisting of W 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 at a binding energy of 35.4 and 37.5 eV, respectively
(Figure 3d).

Electrochemical Studies
To probe
the selectivity of
the synthesized composite materials toward the electrochemical detection
of DA, initially cyclic voltammetric (CV) experiments were performed.
Preliminary measurements were carried out using PVIM–Co5POM conjugate drop-coated on a graphite electrode and
CV measurements were performed in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered solution
(PBS; pH 7.0) containing 500 μM AA and 50 μM DA at a scan
rate of 75 mV s–1. Figure 4a reveals the formation of redox peaks centered
at 210 and 168 mV corresponding to oxidation of DA to dopaminoquinone
and subsequent reduction to DA respectively. However, no peaks with
respect to oxidation of AA was observed in CV, and a feeble peak was
observed for AA in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) (Figure 4b) and the lower
detection limit was found to be 10 μM (Figure 5a). Despite the selective behavior, PVIM–Co5POM conjugate suffers from a broadened electrochemical response
for DA oxidation attributed to the sluggish electron-transfer kinetics.
Functionalized CNTs were incorporated to improve the electron-transfer
process. Depending upon the nature of the functionalities present
within the CNTs, it is possible to mediate and tune the sensitivity
toward DA determination and electron transfer across the interface.

voltammograms, (b) corresponding DPV, and (c) EIS of
various catalysts on graphite electrode in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) solution
containing 500 μM AA and 50 μM DA performed at a scan
rate of 75 mV s–1, counter electrode (CE): Pt wire,
reference electrode (RE): Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl.

μM AA and various concentrations of DA (inset lower concentration
of DA); CE: Pt wire; and RE: Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl.

The PVIM–Co5POM conjugate was taken in
combination
with various NCNTs (NCNT-200, NCNT-400, and NCNT-600, detailed in
the Supporting Information) designated
as PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT composite (synthesis detailed
in Experimental Section) and performed the
analysis under similar conditions. As expected, both PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400 and PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-200 shows
well-behaved redox behavior however, the higher redox current was
observed for PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400 composite, as
shown in CV (Figure 4a). The differential activity towards electro-oxidation of DA could
be because of the kinetics of the interfacial charge-transfer process,
which in turn relates to the electron transfer at the electrode–electrolyte
interface and was further studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS).

As evident from Figure 4c, the Rct (charge-transfer
resistance)
is lower for PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400 composite compared
to the other two catalysts. The higher Rct at PVIM–Co5POM indicates dominance of sluggish
kinetics because of the resistance at electrode–electrolyte
interface. This fortifies the fact that the PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400 composite reveals faster kinetics towards electro-oxidation
of DA because of the facilitated electron transport at the catalyst
surface.

Further, the sensitivity of the PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400
composite was carried out by varying the concentration of DA (500
pM to 600 μM) and keeping AA constant (500 μM). Surprisingly,
the PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400 depicted in Figure 5c shows a noticeable peak at
a very low concentration of DA (500 pM) and a sharp intense peak at
1 nM. Subsequently, a sharp increase in the oxidation peak current
was observed with increase in DA concentration (500 pM to 600 μM, Figure 5b) demonstrating
the superior sensitivity towards the determination of DA. This was
further supported by EIS studies (Figure 5d).

Interestingly, no oxidation peak
corresponding to AA was observed
even at this high AA concentration of 500 μM indicating that
PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400 composite inhibits the diffusion
of AA toward the electrode surface through plausible repulsive electrostatic
interaction between anionic AA and a negatively charged cluster of
Co5POM (Scheme 1). It is important to note that no significant peak corresponding
to the oxidation of AA was observed even with increase in concentration
of DA (600 μM, Figure 5b), demonstrating the complete elimination of AA interference.

Similar experiments using PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-200
(Figure S10, Supporting Information), PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-600 composite shows similar behavior but the peak
current corresponding to oxidation of DA is lower in both of the cases
compared to PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400 composite. It is
noteworthy to mention that, the lowest detection limit was found to
be 1 and 10 μM respectively with the linear detection range
of 1–300 μM (Figure S11a)
in both of the cases, which is lower than PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400 composite. This was further evidenced by EIS studies
(Figure S10b, Supporting Information) wherein Rct decreases with increasing concentration of
DA (up to 300 μM) and with further increase in DA concentration, Rct increases (Figure S10C), and a shift in Rs (solution resistance)
was observed (the oxidation peak current in DPV decreases, figure
not shown) indicating the slow kinetics because of the less electron
transfer at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Further control
experiments using PVIM–Co5POM/oxidized CNT (OCNT)-modified
graphite electrode reveals a broadened electrochemical response toward
oxidation of DA. Surprisingly, no peak corresponding to the oxidation
of DA was observed up to 300 nM concentration of DA, however, a pronounced
broadened peak at −30 mV attributed to oxidation of AA was
observed. Further increase in the concentration of DA, an additional
peak appeared at 100 mV, and peak current increases with the subsequent
increase in DA indicates the interference of AA (Figures 6 and S11, Supporting Information).

Figure 6 Differential pulse voltammograms of PVIM–Co5POM/OCNT
in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) solution containing 500 μM AA and various
concentrations of DA at a step potential 10 mV, pulse amplitude 2
mV, pulse width 500 ms, scan rate 10 mV s–1, CE:
Pt wire, and RE: Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl.

The above results demonstrate the excellent sensitivity of
PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400 composite toward the electrochemical
detection
of DA with a lowest limit of 500 pM (0.0005 μM) and selectivity
with the linear detection range of 0.0005–600 μM (Figure 5). This is one of
the best catalyst reported so far towards the selective electrochemical
detection of DA (comparison tabulated in Table 1). The selectivity of the proposed sensor
was also assessed in the presence of UA nevertheless, neither significant
peak corresponding to the oxidation of UA nor shift in the peak corresponding
to the oxidation of DA was observed with a subsequent increase in
the concentration of DA (200 μM, Figure S12), demonstrating the complete elimination of UA interference.

The plot of anodic
and cathodic peak current with respect to square
root of different scan rate reveals the linear response suggesting
the electro-oxidation process of DA is the diffusion-controlled reaction
(Figures S13–S15, Supporting Information). In an attempt to explore this sensor for practical applications,
the PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400 composite was analyzed
for the detection of DA in real sample using commercially available
DA hydrochloride injections (40 mg mL–1) by standard
addition method, and the recovery of the sample was in the range of
95–102%, demonstrating the applicability of the PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400 composite for real-time analysis as well. Further,
the stability of the PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400 composite
was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry in a solution containing 50 μM
DA (Figure S16, Supporting Information),
which evidently demonstrates the negligible decay in either current
or potential even after 100 consecutive cycles.

The enhanced
selective electrochemical response obtained can be
attributed to the specific electrostatic interaction between the negatively
charged Co5POM and DA (positively charged) through effective
stabilization at NCNTs surface. Moreover, the synergistic effect arising
from the strong π–π interaction between NCNTs and
imidazolium cations of PVIM, along with the electrostatic interaction
between PVIM and Co5POM, which further enhances the electrochemical
response through accelerating the electron transfer from Co5POM to the electrode surface.18

Conclusions
Here, we demonstrated a novel sandwich POM [WCo3(H2O)2(CoW9O34)2]12– and poly(ionic liquid) [PVIM+] in combination
with NCNTs as an electrochemical sensor for a highly selective and
ultrasensitive detection of DA. The novel PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT-400 composite demonstrates a superior selectivity and sensitivity
evident from the DPV studies with a lowest detection limit of 500
pM (500 × 10–12 M). The linear detection range
was found to be 500 pM to 600 μM, even in presence of higher
concentration of AA (500 μM), demonstrating the complete elimination
of AA and UA interference. The ionic polymer acts as a bridge between
Co5POM and NCNTs, which provides physical and chemical
stability simultaneously to eliminate the interference of AA with
increased sensitivity. Employing the efficient heterogenization of
Co5POM catalyst by PVIM over NCNTs provides the synergy
between PVIM–POM catalyst and NCNTs, which enhances the electron
transport at the electrode/electrolyte interface and eliminates the
interference of AA and UA at physiological pH (7.4).

Experimental
Section

All of the reagents and solvents used in
the synthesis of Na12[Co5POM] and PVIMBr were
purchased from Alfa Aesar; KCl, KH2PO4, K2HPO4, and isopropyl alcohol were from Merck. Dopamine
hydrochloride (>99% crystalline) and ascorbic acid (99% crystalline)
were from Sigma-Aldrich and dopamine hydrochloride injections (40
mg mL–1) were purchased from Neon Laboratories Ltd.
Carbon nanotubes were purchased from Applied Science, USA. The aqueous
solutions were prepared using deionized water obtained from a Millipore
system (>12 MΩ cm–1). PBS (0.1 M) was prepared
from the stock solutions of 0.1 M KH2PO4 and
0.1 M K2HPO4.

Synthesis
Poly(1-vinylbutylimidazolium
bromide) (PVIMBr)
Synthesis
of poly(1-vinylbutylimidazolium bromide) (PVIMBr) was performed as
follows, according to our previously reported procedure.18

Poly(1-vinylimidazole) (1)
A Schlenk tube
was charged with 1-vinylimidazole (0.941 g, 10.00 mmol), azobis(isobutyronitrile)
(1.0 wt %, 0.013 g), and 4.0 mL of dry toluene. The mixture was degassed
under vacuum using three freeze–thaw cycles, and the presence
of oxygen, if any, was removed by argon purging for 30 min. The reaction
mixture was heated at 70 °C for 24 h. The obtained solid was
purified using diethyl ether and dried under vacuum to yield 1 as a white powder (0.750 g, 80%). The synthesized polymer
is soluble in water and methanol but insoluble in chloroform, tetrahydrofuran,
and toluene. 1H NMR (D2O, δ ppm) (Figure
S1, Supporting Information): 7.06–6.64
(broad, 3H, imidazole ring proton), 3.74–2.57 (broad, 1H),
2.12–1.9 (broad, 2H).

Poly(1-vinylbutyl imidazolium
bromide) [PVIMBr] (2)
A Schlenk tube fitted
with a condenser was charged with
poly(1-vinylimidazole) 1 (0.339 g, 3.62 mmol), n-butyl bromide (0.543 g, 3.98 mmol), and dry methanol.
The reaction mixture was heated at 60 °C for 48 h and further
added to acetone to obtain a precipitate of 2 (0.772
g, 92.3%). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, δ ppm) (Figure
S2, Supporting Information): 9.61 (broad,
1H, NCHN), 7.83–7.73 (broad, 2H, NCHCHN), 4.12–3.84 (broad, 4H), 2.51–2.49
(broad, 2H), 1.84 (broad, 2H), 1.33 (broad, 2H), 0.94 (broad, 2H).

Na12[WCo3(H2O)2(CoW9O34)2]
The Na12[WCo3(H2O)2(CoW9O34)2] denoted as Na12[Co5POM]
was synthesized under microwave heating for the first time22 (detailed experimental parameters are given
in Table S2, Supporting Information). A
mixture of Na2WO4·2H2O (16.000
g, 48.48 mmol), 60 mL of H2O, and 2 mL of conc. HNO3 was taken in a microwave reaction vessel and microwave irradiated
for 30 min at 80–85 °C. After cooling, solid Co(NO3)2·6H2O (3.656 g, 12.56 mmol) was
added and further microwave irradiated for 30 min at 85–90
°C. The obtained hot solution was filtered, and the filtrate
was subjected to crystallization. After 2–3 days, deep-green-colored
needle-shaped crystals were collected by filtration. The obtained
crystals were recrystallized from water, collected by filtration,
and dried at ∼80 °C under high vacuum to obtain Na12[WCo3(H2O)2(CoW9O34)2] and designated as (Co5POM).
(Yield: 1.562 g, 0.30 mmol, 48.38%). FT-IR (cm–1): 1622, 1388, 916, 858, 684, 531.

PVIM–Co5POM Conjugate
[PVIM][Co5POM] conjugate was prepared
by ion-exchange method. In a Schlenk
tube, Na12[Co5POM] was taken and dissolved in
10 mL of water to get a clear greenish solution. A solution of PVIMBr
(dissolved in 15 mL water) was added slowly to the resulting solution.
Immediately, the clear solution becomes coagulated, and it was then
heated to 80 °C for 2 h. The resultant emulsion suspension was
cooled to room temperature and filtered through frit (the clear colorless
filtrate indicates the formation of the desired conjugate). After
that, it was washed with water and dried at ∼70 °C under
high vacuum to get greenish colored [PVIM][Co5POM] conjugate
(yield 0.328 g, 0.05 mmol, 83.3%).

Synthesis of NCNTs
CNTs with inner diameters of 20–50
nm and outer diameters of 70–200 nm were obtained from Applied
Sciences Inc. (Ohio, USA). Nitrogen functional groups were introduced
to OCNTs (synthesis detailed in Supporting Information) by heating under ammonia with a total flow rate of 25 sccm at 200,
400, and 600 °C for 6 h and are designated as NCNT-200, NCNT-400,
and NCNT-600, respectively, (details given in the Supporting Information).23

Physical Characterization
SC-XRD Studies
The crystal structure
of the synthesized
Co5POM was probed using single graphite-monochromated Mo
Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) on a Bruker D8 SMART
APEX2 CMOS diffractometer at 293 K. Data integration was performed
using SAINT. SIR97 was used to solve the structure, and the refinement
was performed using SHELXL 2013. The obtained structure was corrected
using routine Lorentz and polarization corrections, and empirical
absorption corrections were performed using SADABS. The crystal data
and refinement parameters are compiled and are given in Table S3 (Supporting Information). CIF file for the Na12[Co5POM] is deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Centre (CCDC no. 1558372).

Morphology and Elemental
Analysis
The morphology of
the Na12[Co5POM], PVIM–Co5POM, and PVIM–Co5POM/NCNT composites was analyzed
using field-emission scanning electron microscope (ZEISS, Sigma VP
FE-SEM). FT-IR spectra (2% sample in KBr) were recorded using a Bruker
TENSOR-II spectrometer in the range of 600–4000 cm–1 with a spectral resolution of 4 cm–1 and 100 scans.
FT-IR data were collected and analyzed by OPUS. UV–vis measurements
were performed using Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer.

XPS
of the catalyst materials were recorded (PHI VersaProbe II Spectrometer)
in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber at 10–9 Torr using
Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). The
measurements were performed at a pass energy of 200 eV. The spectra
were calibrated with respect to C (1s) peak at 284.5 eV with a precision
of ±0.2 eV.

Electrochemical Studies
All of the
electrochemical
experiments were performed in a single-compartment electrochemical
cell with three electrode assembly consisting of a graphite electrode
(Ø3 mm) as the working electrode hosting the catalyst, Pt wire
as the CE, and Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl as the RE. Prior to each experiment,
graphite electrodes were polished using different grits of emery paper
and washed thoroughly using deionized water, which was further ultrasonicated
in deionized water for 5 min to remove any physisorbed particles.
The PVIM–Co5POM/NCNTs composite slurry was prepared
by homogeneously grinding the mixture of PVIM–Co5POM and NCNTs (synthesis detailed in the Supporting Information) (1.25 mg, 70:30 wt %) using pestle and mortar
for 1 h, and the obtained product was dispersed in a mixture of isopropyl
alcohol (IPA, 20 μL) and deionized water (480 μL, 12 MΩ)
and further sonicated for 30–40 min. The 20 μL (50 μg)
of the obtained slurry was drop-coated over polished graphite electrode
and dried at room temperature. The electrochemical measurements were
performed using Bio-Logic (VSP 300), and DPV measurements were carried
out at pulse amplitude of 2 mV, pulse width of 500 ms, and step potential
of 10 mV at a scan rate of 10 mV s–1. The EIS measurements
were performed at a DC voltage of 150 mV over a frequency range between
10 MHz and 10 μHz. All measurements were repeated at least 5
times.
