Resistance
to antibiotics has become a serious problem for society,
and there are increasing efforts to understand the reasons for and
sources of resistance. Bacterial-encoded enzymes and transport systems,
both innate and acquired, are the most frequent culprits for the development
of resistance, although in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the catalase-peroxidase, KatG, has been linked to the activation
of the antitubercular drug isoniazid. While investigating a possible
link between aminoglycoside antibiotics and the induction of oxidative
bursts, we observed that KatG reduces susceptibility to aminoglycosides.
Investigation revealed that kanamycin served as an electron donor
for the peroxidase reaction, reducing the oxidized ferryl intermediates
of KatG to the resting state. Loss of electrons from kanamycin was
accompanied by the addition of a single oxygen atom to the aminoglycoside.
The oxidized form of kanamycin proved to be less effective as an antibiotic.
Kanamycin inhibited the crystallization of KatG, but the smaller,
structurally related glycoside maltose did cocrystallize with KatG,
providing a suggestion as to the possible binding site of kanamycin.

Introduction
Catalase-peroxidases
found initially in bacteria and more recently
in some fungi have been the focus of extensive study for over three
decades but continue to provide puzzles and surprises. The first catalase-peroxidase
was isolated from Escherichia coli as
a broad-spectrum peroxidase with a significant catalase activity,1 and, following genetic characterization,2,3 named KatG. Subsequently, KatG became a focus of great interest
when it was found to be the key determinant for the activation of
isoniazid (INH) as an antitubercular drug.4 Compounding its apparent complexity is an oxidase activity that
generates superoxide in the presence of electron donors such as isoniazid
and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.5,6

KatG is a homo-dimer with the 80 000 Da subunits having
distinct N- and C-terminal domains that resemble each other and, at
their core, also the core of plant peroxidases in both sequence and
structure. The catalase and peroxidase activities of KatGs reside
within the heme-containing N-terminal domain with the catalase activity
requiring the cross-linked adduct of the side chains of a Met, a Tyr,
and a Trp; a nearby mobile Arg; and a perhydroxy modification on the
adduct Trp.7−9

The broad-spectrum peroxidase activity of KatG
is typically assayed
using 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazolinesulfonic acid) (ABTS)9 or o-dianisidine,1 the oxidation products of which can be easily
assayed colorimetrically. Small aromatic phenols and anilines are
also substrates,10 albeit more difficult
to assay. Isoniazid is cleaved to an isonicotinyl radical with coincident
generation of superoxide, and the isonicotinyl radical can react with
NAD+ to form an isonicotinyl-NAD radical, which is reduced
by a superoxide to the active antitubercular drug isonicotinyl-NAD.11,12

A recent hypothesis suggests that bacterial killing caused
by bactericidal
aminoglycoside antibiotics is at least in part the result of a reactive
oxygen response induced by the antibiotic.13,14 A corollary to this hypothesis is that KatG and other catalases
might possibly ameliorate the effect of the antibiotic by reducing
the level of reactive oxygen species, thereby enhancing antibiotic
resistance. We report here that there is indeed a correlation between
the presence of KatG and reduced susceptibility to the aminoglycoside
antibiotics. However, the reduced susceptibility is a result of direct
oxidation of the antibiotic by KatG as part of the peroxidatic cycle
rather than KatG reacting with and removing reactive oxygen species.

Results
KatG Imparts
Protection against Aminoglycoside Antibiotics
The initial
rationale for investigating a possible role of KatG
in aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance lay in the hypothesis that
bactericidal antibiotics induce a reactive oxygen response that may
be responsible for the bacterial killing.13,14 If one of the reactive oxygen species was hydrogen peroxide, the
presence of catalase or peroxidase might reduce the effectiveness
of the antibiotic. This was tested initially in a comparison of the
sensitivity to kanamycin of the E. coli catalase mutants, UM1 and UM2 (both with katE katG genotype generated by nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis2 with their respective parental strains, CSH7 and CSH57a).
Both mutants exhibited enhanced sensitivity to kanamycin compared
to that of their parents, with UM1 (Figure 1a) exhibiting a much greater increase than
that from UM2 (Figure 1b). The katG genes in UM1 and UM2 had both undergone
a single base change, C to T in UM1, causing a Leu to Phe change at
residue 138 close to the heme cavity, and G to A in UM2, causing a
Gly to Asp change at residue 118 in the vicinity of mobile Arg426.
Therefore, the large difference between UM1 and UM2 suggested that
nitrosoguanidine had caused other mutations, and to assess more clearly
the effect of unique catalase mutations, a series of isogenic strains
was investigated. First, the isogenic series of MP180 (parent), UM120
(katE::Tn10), UM122 (rpoS::Tn10,
originally katF::Tn10), and UM202 (katG::Tn10)15 was investigated, revealing
enhanced sensitivity to kanamycin only in UM202 containing a disrupted katG gene (Figure 1c). A similar degree of enhanced sensitivity to kanamycin
is observable in a strain of Acinetobacter baumannii with a deletion in katG, but not katE (Figure 1d).

Cultures were grown to an absorbance of 1.0–1.5 at 600 nm and
diluted to an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm, followed by dilution by
10–5, 10–4, 10–3, 10–2, 10–1, and 0, from left
to right, and spotting on Luria broth (LB) plates containing 1.0 μg/mL
kanamycin (a–e), 1.0 μg/mL gentamycin (f), and 1.0 μg/mL
tobramycin (g). (a) E. coli CSH1 (parent)
and nitrosoguanidine-generated UM1 (katE katG). (b) E. coli CSH57a (parent) and nitrosoguanidine-generated

(WT) and its ΔkatG and ΔkatE derivatives. (e–g) UM262 (katG::Tn10 katE) transformed with pKS and pBpKatG (8).

The fact that a single gene dosage of katG elicits
an increased tolerance to kanamycin suggested that overexpression
of katG from a multicopy plasmid might possibly elicit
greater tolerance, and this is indeed the case. Elevated KatG levels
significantly enhance tolerance to kanamycin (Figure 1e) and only slightly less so against gentamycin
(Figure 1f) and tobramycin
(Figure 1g). The control
strain contained the parent plasmid to correct for the effects of
the multicopy plasmid. We would like to point out that the difference
in susceptibility was observed only when cells were spotted on the
agar plate and not using two-fold serial dilution method (data not
shown). We suspect that this is because spotting cells directly on
the agar plate from an overnight culture (as described in Materials and Methods) ensured that there was high
enough expression of KatG to mediate tolerance to kanamycin.

Kanamycin
as an Electron Source for the Reduction of KatG Compound
I*
The reduced susceptibility to kanamycin induced by KatG
is consistent with the hypothesis that KatG ameliorates an oxidative
burst involving H2O2, but the fact that the
more reactive catalase, KatE or HPII, provides no such protection
suggested a different mechanism, most likely involving either the
oxidase or the peroxidase activity. Involvement of the oxidase activity
was ruled out by the absence of superoxide generation and by the lack
of oxygen depletion in a mixture of KatG and kanamycin (data not shown).
This led to a focus on the peroxidatic activity of KatG as the mediator
of enhanced tolerance to kanamycin.

KatG was initially characterized
as having a broad-spectrum peroxidase activity with substrates ranging
from ABTS and o-dianisidine to small aromatic amines,
phenols, and INH. To determine if the substrate range extended to
aminoglycoside antibiotics, the compound I* ferryl intermediate mixture16 of KatG was challenged with kanamycin and the
rate of return of the hypochromic Soret peak from 413 nm to the resting
state at 407 was monitored spectrophotometrically (Figure 2). The oxoferryl form of KatG
naturally undergoes a slow autocatalytic reduction with electrons
drawn from oxidizable side chains in the protein (Figure 2a),17 but kanamycin (Figure 2b) substantially enhanced the rate of reduction (Figure 2c).

2.5, 3, 4, and 5 min (blue in (a) and purple in (b)). (c) Changes

Kanamycin as an Electron
Source for Reactivation of the Catalatic
Process in KatG
The catalase reaction of KatGs undergoes
a gradual inactivation during catalatic turnover, attributed to the
accumulation of a partially oxidized17 and
catalatically inactive state,18 and the
rate of inactivation is enhanced in the presence of carbon monoxide
(CO).19 Originally, inactivation in the
presence of CO was attributed to the accumulation of an inactive ferrous–CO
[Fe2+–CO] complex (19), but because (1) the peroxidase
activity is not inactivated coincidentally (Figure S1a), (2) the inactivation can be reversed by electron donation
from ABTS (Figures 3 and S1), and (3) there is no electron
density associated with the heme iron in a crystal soaked with H2O2 in the presence of CO (Figure S2 and Table S3, 5KT9), it is more likely that a partially
oxidized state of KatG is simply accumulating more rapidly in the
presence of CO. Like ABTS, which donates electrons to reduce the partially
oxidized state of KatG back to the resting state, kanamycin is also
effective in reversing the inhibition of KatG during catalatic turnover
in the presence of CO, consistent with it being an effective electron
donor for KatGs (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Kanamycin prevents the inactivation of catalase activity in the
presence of CO. Oxygen evolution in a solution of 1.74 pmol/mL BpKatG
in pH 7.0 potassium phosphate buffer (black) and in the same buffer
saturated with CO (red), supplemented with 0.4 mM ABTS (blue), 2.0
mM kanamycin (purple), and 3 mM maltose (orange).

Mass Spectrometric Identification of the Kanamycin Oxidation
Product
Peroxidatic substrates by definition donate electrons
to reduce the compound I* or ferryl intermediate mixture16 generated following oxidation of the peroxidase
heme, but the final substrate oxidation product varies with the substrate
ranging from radical formation in the case of ABTS to quinone formation
in the case of some phenols. To confirm that kanamycin was indeed
being oxidized in the peroxidatic reaction, samples of kanamycin before
and after treatment were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis.
The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) conditions
produce kanamycin ions at the expected m/z 485.2 and also an associated sodium ion at m/z 507.2 (485.2 + 22.0). In addition, samples of
untreated kanamycin contain barely detectable ions at m/z 501.2 (485.2 + 16.0) and m/z 523.2 (507.2 + 16.0) (Figure 4). Incubation of kanamycin with KatG increases
the ion at m/z 523.2 (Figure 4b) to 10–20% of the
total, and treatment with KatG and glucose oxidase and glucose (the
latter to provide H2O2 for KatG oxidation and
probably chemical oxidation of kanamycin) increases the m/z 523.2 ion to >50% of the total (Figure 4c). The m/z 501.2 ion was never intense enough under any conditions
to be measured accurately. The conclusion to be drawn from the increment
of 16 Da is that a single oxygen atom is added to kanamycin, a somewhat
unusual reaction in the absence of a loss of hydrogen atoms.

well-documented product of MALDI.20

Oxidation of Kanamycin
Reduces Its Effectiveness as an Antibiotic
The correlation
of reduced susceptibility to kanamycin with apparent
oxidation of kanamycin suggested that the oxidized form of kanamycin
is a less effective antibiotic than kanamycin itself. This hypothesis
was tested by treating kanamycin with a mixture of glucose oxidase
and glucose with and without KatG and spotting bacteria on plates
containing either treated or untreated kanamycin (1.0 μg/mL).
As predicted, growth of both MP180 and UM202 is much less susceptible
to oxidized kanamycin as compared with untreated kanamycin (Figure 5). Somewhat surprisingly,
KatG did not enhance the change in susceptibility involving glucose
oxidase plus glucose, and KatG oxidized with peracetic acid elicits
a similar, albeit less striking, response (not shown). Clearly, chemical
oxidation by H2O2 is the main pathway for kanamycin
oxidation in this experiment.

Figure 5 Susceptibility of MP180 and UM202 to untreated
(a) and oxidized
kanamycin (b). Oxidized kanamycin (1.0 μg/mL) was generated
in a mixture with 5 mg/mL glucose oxidase and 5 mM glucose for 2.5
h at room temperature. The presence of KatG in the mixture did not
change the resulting pattern of growth. Untreated kanamycin (1.0 μg/mL)
was incubated for the same time with glucose but no oxidase. The solutions
were then added to the agar as the plates were poured. Dilutions of
MP180 and UM202 were plated as in Figure 1.

Binding of Maltose to KatG
Implicit in the observation
of oxoferryl reduction by glycosides is the existence, however transient,
of an interaction or association of the glycosides with KatG. A binding
site for INH on KatG was identified by cocrystallization,12 and the same strategy was applied to kanamycin
with 100 mM kanamycin included in the crystallization solution with
BpKatG. Despite repeated attempts, crystals did not form in the presence
of kanamycin, and formed only in its absence, suggesting that kanamycin
was interfering with the crystallization process. With two glycosidic
bonds and three six-membered rings, kanamycin is a large glycoside,
and cocrystallization was also attempted with the smaller disaccharide,
maltose. Crystals of KatG formed in the presence of 100 mM maltose
and X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.80 Å and refined
to Rcryst and Rfree values of 13.6 and 16.2%, respectively (Table S3). Inspection of the resulting electron density maps revealed
a region of strong Fo–Fcdensity near Arg506 that was not present in a crystal
grown in the absence of maltose. Inclusion of a single molecule of
glucose in the model satisfied the density (Figure 6), but there was no density corresponding
to the second glucose unit of the maltose, which was presumably present
in multiple conformations.

Figure 6 Maltose binding to KatG. The Fo–Fc omit electron
density map at 7.0σ was
calculated without maltose in the model.

The maltose–KatG interactions include two direct hydrogen-bond
interactions, C2–OH with OE2 of E529 (2.5 Å) and C3–OH
with NE of R506 (2.8 Å) as well as two indirect interactions,
one with C6–OH through water with OE1 of Q583 and one with
the hexose ring O5 through water with C=O of R506 (Figure 6). The occupancy
is clearly greater in the B subunit where the site falls in a shallow
pocket just at the edge of the crystal interface, although there are
no direct contacts with the symmetry-related subunit. KatG was also
crystallized in the presence of glucose, and the resulting electron
density maps contained a region of density in the same location as
that for maltose, albeit much weaker, suggesting much lower occupancy.
The binding site at the crystal interface may explain why crystals
did not form in the presence of kanamycin, but there is otherwise
no indication of where kanamycin might be binding to KatG.

The
interaction of maltose suggested that it too might be a peroxidatic
electron donor. However, unlike kanamycin, maltose did not substantially
enhance the rate of autocatalytic reduction of the compound I* ferryl
intermediates (data not shown) and only weakly prevented the inactivation
of KatG in the presence of CO (Figure 3). Maltose was oxidized to a limited extent by KatG
and effectively by glucose oxidase (Figure S3).

Discussion
In less than a century since the first clinical
use of antibiotics,
it is feared that the preantibiotic era might be returning as a result
of resistance of bacterial pathogens to almost all classes of antibiotics.
Consequently, new and effective antibiotics are urgently needed. Understanding
the molecular mechanisms leading to reduced susceptibility to antibiotics
is key to finding new and effective antibiotics that bypass resistance
mechanisms. In this work, we show that catalase-peroxidase KatG can
lead to the modification leading to inactivation of aminoglycoside
activity and therefore contribute toward a bacterial cell’s
reduced susceptibility to these antibiotics.

Catalase-peroxidases
have garnered considerable notoriety from
the role of KatG in the activation of the pro-drug INH into its antitubercular
form, isonicotinyl-NAD. Mutation of the katG gene
in Mycobacterium tuberculosis at a
number of different locations slows IN-NAD synthesis, leading to INH
resistance.12,21 Our data show that the opposite
is true in the case of aminoglycosides; it is the presence of KatG
that leads to reduced susceptibility or tolerance to aminoglycoside
antibiotics. One of the three common mechanisms giving rise to aminoglycoside
resistance is enzymatic modification involving acetylation, adenylylation,
or phosphorylation.22 We show for the first
time that the oxidation of kanamycin caused by KatG therefore presents
a fourth mechanism of aminoglycoside modification leading to inactivation.
As shown in Figure 1, the effect was also observed, albeit less pronounce than that for
kanamycin, for other members of aminoglycosides, i.e., gentamycin
and tobramycin. How broad-based the effect of KatG-mediated aminoglycoside
tolerance might be in Gram-negative species remains to be determined,
but clearly it cannot be a factor in organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa that do not produce KatG.
However, it should also be noted that an oxidative burst in bacteria
may lead to chemical oxidation of kanamycin and reduced susceptibility.

The cocrystallization of maltose with KatG near the crystal interface
and absence of crystal formation with kanamycin suggest that the two
glycosides may bind at the same site but that the larger kanamycin
molecule interferes with crystal formation. In addition, the orientation
of the single glucose unit in the crystal provides insight into the
probable orientation of kanamycin. Both hexose units of kanamycin
can potentially fit into the same site, but the C3″–NH2 hexose unit would place the NH2 group adjacent
to Arg506, whereas the C6′–NH2 hexose unit
would have the NH2 group more favorably adjacent to C=O
of Gln583. Therefore, it is the cleavage of the C1′–O–C4
glycosidic linkage that is shown in Figure S4.

The oxidation reaction is somewhat unusual in that a single
oxygen
atom is added without the loss of hydrogen atoms, most likely a result
of cleavage of the hexose C5′–O–C1′ bonds
with coincident C1′ oxidation (Figure S4). Overall, two electrons are lost in the process, sufficient to
reduce the compound I* ferryl intermediate mixture back to the resting
state in KatG. However, it is impossible to conclude a direct stoichiometry
especially in light of the very slow turnover rate of 0.5–1.0
per minute in KatG, similar to that of INH activation.

In summary,
using a combination of phenotypic, structural, biochemical,
and genetic approaches, we show that overexpression of KatG can result
in a reduced susceptibility to the aminoglycoside kanamycin. Although
the presence of KatG may not confer clinical resistance, it can result
in reduced intracellular concentrations of the active kanamycin molecule,
which in turn can potentially result in the accumulation of other
resistance mechanisms such as efflux and target-site mutation(s).

Materials
and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Chemicals
A list of bacterial
strains and plasmids is provided in Table S1. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher unless
otherwise stated. All media components were obtained from Becton-Dickinson,
and all restriction enzymes were obtained from Invitrogen.

Creation
of Gene Deletions of katG and katE in A. baumannii
Both katG (A1S_0412) and katE (A1S_1386)
deletions in A. baumannii ATCC17978
were carried out using a homologous recombination-based method as
described previously23 with slight modifications.
Briefly, an upstream portion and a downstream portion of the target
gene were amplified using the primers described in Table S1, which contained added FRT regions flanking 3′
and 5′ ends, respectively, and a gentamicin resistance (GmR) marker containing complementary FRT regions cloned between
the upstream and the downstream portions of the target gene using
sequence overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR)24 to generate the gene knockout cassette. This
knockout cassette was then cloned into suicide vector pMO13024 digested with SmaI, and the
resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli SM10 cells for conjugation into A. baumannii ATCC17978. Conjugants were grown in 10% sucrose to induce the second
recombination event using the counter-selectable sacB marker in pMO130, and ultimately the GmR marker was excised
using the Flp-FRT recombination to yield the unmarked deletions in
both katG and katE genes. katG was deleted leaving 3 bp in the 5′-end and 9
bp in the 3′-end of the gene, resulting in a deletion of 2139
bp from 2154 bp long gene. In the case of katE, a
total of 1869 bp were deleted from the full gene (2139 bp) leaving
247 bp in the 5′-end and 25 bp in the 3′-end. Both gene
deletions were confirmed initially with PCR. The oligonucleotides
used are listed in Table S2.

Enzyme Assays
Catalase activity was determined by the
method of Rørth and Jensen25 in a
Gilson oxygraph equipped with a Clark electrode. One unit of catalase
is defined as the amount that decomposes 1 μmol of H2O2 in 1 min in a 60 mM H2O2 solution
at pH 7.0 and 37 °C. Peroxidase activity was determined using
2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazolinesulfonic acid) (ABTS) (ε405 = 36 800 M–1 cm–1),26 and one unit is defined as the amount
that decomposes 1 μmol ABTS in a solution of 0.4 mM ABTS and
2.5 mM hydrogen peroxide at pH 4.5 and 25 °C.27

For spectroscopic analysis, the compound I* ferryl
intermediate mixture of KatG was generated by mixing in 1 mL final
volume 3.6 nmol of subunit in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH
7.0, with 36 nmol of peracetic acid also in 50 mM potassium phosphate
buffer, pH 7.0, and let sit at 20 °C for 1 min when 300 nmol
of kanamycin was added. The change in absorbance in the 350–700
nm range was monitored.

Mass Spectrometric Analysis
Samples
were prepared in
50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7, using the same concentrations and incubation
times as used for the spectroscopic analysis. Protein, if present
during incubation, was removed by filtration through Amicon Ultra
50 K molecular weight cut-off filters and concentrated to dryness.
Reconstituted samples at 1 mg/mL in water were cocrystallized with
an equal volume of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid prepared in water/acetonitrile
3:1 with 0.2% formic acid on a metal target. Spectra were acquired
on a Bruker UltraflexExtreme MALDI TOF–TOF instrument.

Antibiotic
Susceptibility Assays
To determine antibiotic
susceptibility, cultures were grown in LB medium to an absorbance
of 1.0–1.5 at 600 nm and diluted to a final absorbance of 1.0
at 600 nm followed by serial dilutions from 1 to 10–5. Aliquots of 2 μL were spotted on LB plates supplemented with
antibiotics at 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 μg/mL.

Crystallization of the
KatG Variants
The catalase-peroxidase
from Burkholderia pseudomallei, BpKatG,
was expressed and purified as described.28 Crystals of BpKatG grown in the absence or presence of 100 mM maltose
were obtained at room temperature by the vapor diffusion hanging drop
method at 20 °C over a reservoir solution containing 15–17.5%
poly(ethylene glycol) 4000 (w/v), 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 100
mM maltose, 70 mM NaCl, and 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 5.6.8,12 Crystals were primitive orthorhombic space group P212121 with two subunits in the
crystal asymmetric unit. For treatment with H2O2, the crystal was soaked for 1 min in mother liquor saturated with
CO and containing 5 mM H2O2. Diffraction data
were collected using synchrotron beam line CMCF 08ID-1 at the Canadian
Light Source in Saskatoon, SK, from crystals flash-cooled in reservoir
buffer and cooled with a nitrogen cryostream. Data were processed
and scaled using XDS29 and SCALA30 (Table S3). The structure
refinements starting with the native BpKatG structure (1MWV) were
completed using the REFMAC31 program and
manual modeling with the molecular graphics COOT32 program. Figures were generated using PYMOL (the PYMOL
Molecular Graphics System, Schrodinger, LLC).
