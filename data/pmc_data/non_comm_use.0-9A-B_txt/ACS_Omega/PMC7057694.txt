A facile method was used to synthesize
biocomposites containing
differing ratios of hyaluronic acid (HA) and cellulose (CEL). Based
on the properties of the individual polymers, the resultant composite
materials may have potentially great wound care properties. In the
method outlined here, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim][Cl]),
a simple ionic liquid, was used as the sole solvent without chemical
modifiers to dissolve the biopolymers at ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 HA
to CEL. This method was completely recyclable since the ionic liquid,
[Bmim][Cl], can be recovered. Results from spectroscopic measurements
[Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD)] confirm
the interaction between HA and CEL. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images reflect differing biopolymer ratios and the resulting impact
on the texture and porosity of these composite materials. The composites
exhibited high swelling capacity in various media. These composites
were also drug-loaded to examine drug release properties for greater
potential in combating Staphylococcus aureus infections.

==== Body
Introduction
Hyaluronic acid (HA)
is a glycosaminoglycan that is found throughout
connective, endothelial, and neural tissues.1 It has unique properties, such as high hygroscopicity, viscoelasticity,
biocompatibility, and nonimmunogenicity, and does not generate toxic
products upon degradation.2 These unique
properties are thought to be beneficial in wound care bandage materials
as HA has been investigated for a number of clinical applications,
including lubrication and mechanical support of arthritic joints,3,4 as a surgical aid in ophthalmological surgery,5,6 drug
delivery agent,7−9 and to facilitate surgical wound healing.10−12 Hyaluronic acid has also recently been used in skin-care products,
such as facial moisturizers, as a result of its aqueous viscous consistency
and nonallergenic tissue friendliness.13 However, one disadvantage of HA is its lack of adequate mechanical
properties.14 To overcome this disadvantage,
our laboratory focuses on the fabrication of composites from HA and
cellulose (CEL) in this manuscript.

Cellulose (CEL) is a polysaccharide
and the primary constituent
of plant cell walls. It is biocompatible and biodegradable. Cellulose
was chosen for this study because it lends chemical stability and
mechanical strength to composite materials.15 Different forms of cellulose have recently been used as additives
in composite biopolymer fabrication. For example, Huang et al. fabricated
berberine-enriched carboxymethylcellulose–hyaluronic acid hydrogels
with excellent viscosity to provide anti-inflammatory and antibacterial
functions for minimizing postsurgical complications. However, these
composites required polyvinyl alcohol as a base to assist membrane
formation.16 Jia et al. have shown that
bacterial cellulose (BC) and hyaluronic acid can be combined into
composites with enhanced tensile strength and Young’s modulus.17 While BC has been widely used for various applications,
cellulose derived from cotton (as used in this manuscript) is thermodynamically
more stable than BC.18 In addition, the
fabrication of these composites required cross-linking reactions or
soaking BC for several days in HA.17 In
another example, Domingues et al.19 determined
that cellulose nanocrystals and hyaluronic acid can be combined into
hydrogel materials for injectable purposes. However, these materials
also required the covalent modification of HA and CEL using additional
cross-linkers.19

Tran et al.15 used ionic liquids (ILs)
to combine chitosan and cellulose into composite materials with enhanced
tensile strength, as well as antimicrobial properties. In addition,
materials reported by Tran et al. exhibited an increased antimicrobial
effect on a wider range of bacteria than other chitosan-based materials.15,20,21 By fabrication of these biopolymers
into composite materials, we rationalize that the combined properties
of mechanical integrity, hygroscopicity, and biocompatibility could
be beneficial for potential wound care devices. To obtain these composites,
we hypothesize that the use of ionic liquids would be a viable and
facile alternative for dissolving biopolymers, such as HA and CEL,
as compared to previously mentioned procedures.

Ionic liquids
(ILs) are organic salts that are liquid at temperatures
below 100 °C.22 ILs have various,
unique chemical and physical properties, including high thermal stability,
high solubility power, low volatility, and negligible vapor pressure.
Because of these properties, ILs have been labeled as “green”
alternatives to traditional, organic solvents.23 In addition, due to their high solvating ability, ILs have
been used as solvents in dissolving biopolymers, including cellulose,
extensively.15,24−27 However, limited information
was found regarding ILs to dissolve HA. For this reason, we explored
ILs as potential solvents for composite fabrication. In this study,
we demonstrate that a simple ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
chloride ([Bmim][Cl]), solubilizes both hyaluronic acid and cellulose
and allows composite formation without the use of chemical modifications
or cross-linking reactions. One anticipated challenge of [Bmim][Cl]
is the high viscosity associated with the halide anion,28 but viscosity was not an issue with the elevated
temperature needed for fabrication. Overall, this method proved that
it is simple, green, and completely recyclable.

We also note
that composites impregnated with antimicrobial agents
may be used as topical medicated devices. Previous studies support
the use of antimicrobial group of uniform materials based on organic
salts (GUMBOS) as a chemical approach for combating various Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacteria.29,30 GUMBOS are a group
of novel materials, similar to ILs, composed of bulky inorganic and/or
organic counterions with melting points between 25 and 250 °C.31 GUMBOS employed in this manuscript were formulated
from chlorhexidine, an antiseptic, and β-lactam antibiotics,
oxacillin and cephalothin. These materials have been proven to be
more effective than the constituent parent compounds against various
strains of bacteria, most notably Staphylococcus aureus, which is one of the most common bacteria found on the skin and
hair, as well as noses and throats of humans and animals.32 This bacterium is capable of manifesting severe
clinical infections.

Herein, we explore the development and
characterization of a green
and recyclable method using ionic liquids to fabricate composites from biocompatible and biodegradable
biopolymers (e.g., hyaluronic acid and cellulose) and exploit their
biomedical use as wound care devices for minimizing bacterial infections.
The main advantages of this approach are the ease of fabrication,
cross-linking agents are not necessary, and high swelling abilities
of resulting composites. Preparation of these biocomposites demonstrates
promising applications as patches for use in wound care.

Results and Discussion
FT-IR
Analysis
FT-IR spectroscopy was employed to determine
the chemical structure of the composite materials. Spectra were measured
using a Bruker Tensor 27 (Billerica, MA) under transmission wavenumber
ranging from 650 to 4000 cm–1 (Figure 1a,b). The HA spectrum had absorption
bands at 1604 and 1405 cm–1. These are indicative
bands of the carboxylate asymmetric stretching vibration and carboxylate
symmetric stretching, respectively.33 Bands
at 1145 and 1027 cm–1 are C–O–C stretching
vibration of the HA skeleton.34 Two signals
at 1560 and 1322 cm–1 are indicative of amide bands.33 In the region of 1150–650 cm–1, there is little difference between the spectra of the composites
and HA. This verifies the presence of HA in these composite materials.
All spectra have a strong absorption band between 3600 and 3000 cm–1, which is indicative of the O–H stretching
region (Figure 1b).
While these peaks are not as broad in composite materials, they are
broader than the cellulose O–H peak. This narrow peak for cellulose
is presumably due to hydrogen bonding within the glucose monomer network.
This change in peak shape within the composites suggests hydrogen-bonding
interactions between the HA and cellulose in the composite materials.35

and O–H
stretching region (b).

Thermal Stability of Composites
Figure 2 displays
the thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) spectra for the parent biopolymers and composite materials.
TGA was performed using a Hi Res modulated TGA 2950 thermogravimetric
analyzer (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE). Small pieces weighing about
20 mg were placed in a platinum pan and heated from room temperature
to 575 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. Onset temperatures were
extrapolated and denote the temperature at which the weight loss begins.
Onset temperatures for cellulose and hyaluronic acid were 332.70 and
228.12 °C, respectively (Table 1). Onset temperatures of the composites decreased by
9 and 30 °C, as compared to those of cellulose for 1:1 and 2:1,
respectively. The 1:1 composite had an onset temperature of 324.27
°C, while the 2:1 composite had an onset temperature of 305.44
°C. The 2:1 composite most likely had a lower degradation temperature
due to the higher concentration of HA, which is known to be a thermally
sensitive material.

X-ray Diffraction
(XRD)
X-ray diffraction was employed
to determine how the varying amount of HA affects the crystallinity
of cellulose. XRD was performed using an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer
(Malvern Panalytical, U.K.). Evaluation of data presented in Figure 3a confirms that HA
is completely amorphous. The supramolecular structure of fibrous cellulose
exists as cellulose I, and its crystallinity is a result of a ratio
between two forms (Iβ and Iα). As
shown in Figure 3,
fibrous cellulose has five characteristic peaks at 14.9, 16.4, 20.6,
22.7, and 34.5°, which corresponds to the 101, 101̅, 021,
002, and 040 planes, respectively.36,37 The crystallinity
pattern of fibrous cellulose is more characteristic of a higher concentration
of cellulose Iβ than Iα, a ratio
more prevalent in woody plants and cotton, which is the origin of
cellulose used in this manuscript.18 In
general, the composites maintain the characteristic peaks of cellulose.
However, there is a slight increase in amorphous scattering between
14.9 and 22.7° diffraction angles in both 1:1 and 2:1 composites.

Figure 3 XRD spectra
of CEL and HA (a), and 1:1 and 2:1 composites (b).

Crystallinity indices (CIs) of these materials were determined
using the Segal method (eq 2), whereby I002 is the intensity
of the 002-lattice diffraction and Iam is the intensity of diffraction at 2θ = 18°.37 The crystallinity indices are presented in Table 2. According to eq 1, the CI of cellulose is
85.9%. As shown in Table 2, CIs of both composites were lower than that of cellulose
with the 2:1 composite having the lowest CI. This can be attributed
to the higher content of amorphous HA in relation to cellulose within
the composite network. The amorphous material disrupts the crystalline
lattice of the cellulose, thus lowering its CI 1  Drug loading of the composites was
also evaluated
using XRD (Figure S3). Moreover, powder
XRD was employed to elucidate the crystalline nature of [CHX][Oxa]
and amorphous nature of [CHX][Ceph] (Figure S4). There is no obvious difference between the XRD spectra of plain
composites versus drug-loaded. However, there are slight changes in
the crystallinity indices, which were calculated for drug-loaded composites
(Table S1). [CHX][Oxa] had a larger effect
on CI; for example, in 1:1 composites, [CHX][Oxa] loading lowered
the CI from 78.1 to 75.3%. This could possibly be due to adsorption
of the drug onto the surface of the materials. In contrast, with 2:1
composites, [CHX][Oxa] loading increased the CI from 76.6 to 77.9%
as a result of greater interactions of [CHX][Oxa] within the network
of these composites.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Composites were
cut into small pieces, and the surfaces (before and after drug loading)
were spin-coated with a thin layer of conductive platinum. Surface
morphologies were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (Quanta
3D DualBeam FEG FIB-SEM, FEI) at 5 kV. All images (Figure 4) are at 5000×. Higher-magnification
images can be found in the Supporting Information (Figures S5 and S6). The composites exhibited a textured, porous
surface; however, for a 2:1 composite, the pores were larger with
more irregularity in shape. The fibrous networks of CEL and HA are
clearly delineated within the pores. Instead, the 1:1 composite exhibited
a smoother, planar texture. In comparison to the original materials,
drug-loaded composites also exhibited a smoother-looking surface,
indicating loading of the drug on the surface and in the pores. As
a result, the fibrous networks were no longer observable after drug
loading of [CHX][Ceph] in both 1:1 and 2:1 composites. It is presumed
that the loading of [CHX][Oxa] would also exhibit the same smooth-looking
surface.

Figure 4 Morphology of 1:1 composite (a), 2:1 composite (b), [CHX][Ceph]-loaded
1:1 composite (c), and [CHX][Ceph]-loaded 2:1 composite (d).

Cross-sectional areas (before and after drug loading)
were also
evaluated by SEM at 5 kV. These images can be found in the Supporting
Information (Figures S7 and S8). Cross-sectional
areas of composite materials (1:1 and 2:1) show no discernable difference
between the drug-loaded and nondrug-loaded composites. However, 1:1
composites exhibited a network of higher density within the matrix
as compared to 2:1 composites. Similar to the surface, 2:1 composites
exhibited a much more porous network within the composite matrix.

Swelling Studies
Swelling studies were performed to
demonstrate the exudation capacity of these potential wound care composites,
as well as investigate the effect of varying polymer ratios on capacity.
Swelling percentages are illustrated in Figure 5. In all studied media, the 2:1 (HA/CEL)
composite had a much higher swelling than the 1:1 (HA/CEL) material.
These results indicate that the swelling ratio increased as the pore
size and amorphous nature of the composites increased as amorphous
regions are able to absorb more water than crystalline regions.38 Moreover, evaluation of these results indicates
that as the density of fibers within the composite material decreased,
the swelling increased. The high-density network within 1:1 composites
could prevent the absorption of media, whereas the higher porosity
within 2:1 materials provides voids for more facile absorption. The
higher ratio of hygroscopic HA could also play a role in the absorption
capacity of 2:1 composites. A larger degree of swelling could also
be attributed to the higher concentration of sodium ions on HA that
may have aided in balancing the internal osmosis.39 Interestingly, all composites maintained structural integrity,
which can be attributed to the mechanical strength of cellulose. Images
of dry and swollen composites are found in the Supporting Information
(Figures S9 and S10). In comparison to
hydrogels fabricated by Domingues et al., the swelling of composites
synthesized in this manuscript was significantly higher.19 This could be due to no cross-linking agents
used in the fabrication process. Instead of creating physical cross-links,
this process is more akin to solution blending, thereby maintaining
the hygroscopic functional groups of HA. Fibrous cellulose also has
relatively higher absorbent properties, which could make it a better
choice for topical applications such as wound management.40

saline,
and 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4).

Release Properties
The release of two antimicrobial
GUMBOS was determined spectrophotometrically in a 0.9% saline solution
at λ = 231 nm. The cumulative amount of drug released and the
percentage of drug released as a function of time for [CHX][Ceph]
and [CHX][Oxa] are shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively. Upon the
placement of composites into the saline medium, an initial large amount
of drug is released in what is known as “burst release”.41 After the initial burst, the rate at which drugs
are released decreases and all drugs have been released between 4
and 6 h. This is evident from the stable plateau between the 4 and
6 h time point. Burst release could be beneficial for wound treatment
as quick release could ensure the rapid reduction of bacteria from
wound sites.41−43 Overall, the 1:1 composite showed a much higher release
of drugs than the 2:1 ratio. In both drug release studies, the 1:1
composite exhibited quantitative drug release as shown in Figures 6b and 7b. In contrast, the 2:1 material did not achieve quantitative
release over the same time period. This could be attributed to the
morphology of the surface and inner network of the composites. The
1:1 composite, as seen in Figure 4a, exhibits less pores than the 2:1 composite and a
denser inner network. Presumably, drug molecules are not physically
able to penetrate the 1:1 network as deeply and concentrate more on
the surface. In effect, these drug molecules are then released from
the surface in a “burst” manner when placed into saline.
In contrast, the 2:1 composite exhibited a much more porous surface
(Figure 4b) and less
dense inner network, which could allow trapping of the drug further
within the fibrous network and impede the rate and quantity of the
release of organic molecules. Both composites (1:1 and 2:1) released
more [CHX][Ceph] than [CHX][Oxa], which we hypothesize could be a
result of [CHX][Oxa] having a stronger interaction with the composite
material than [CHX][Ceph].

Figure 6 Cumulative drug release (a) and percent drug
release (b) for [CHX][Ceph].

Figure 7 Cumulative
drug release (a) and percent drug release (b) for [CHX][Oxa].

Drug-loaded and drug-released composites were also
evaluated using
electron-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to confirm drug release
(Quanta 3D DualBeam FEG FIB-SEM with an EDAX Pegasus EDS/EBSD detector).
GUMBOS structures contain sulfur atoms (Figure S11). EDS spectra of plain composites can be found in the Supporting
Information (Figures S12 and S13). After
evaluation of drug-loaded composites using EDS, it was confirmed that
the sulfur-containing drugs were present in the loaded samples. We
also observed that the sulfur signal decreases in drug-released samples
(Figures S14–S16).

Disk Diffusion
Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion is
a qualitative susceptibility test used to determine the sensitivity
or resistance of a microorganism toward an antimicrobial agent.44 In this study, disk diffusion was performed
to demonstrate drug release from composites onto an agar surface.
Three concentrations were loaded onto the disks and composite rounds:
10, 50, and 250 μM. During incubation, the drug diffuses from
composites and disks into the agar. After 20–24 h incubation,
zones of inhibition (ZOI) formed around the disks and composites,
and the diameters were measured using a ruler. The zone of inhibition
is a circular area around the disk (or composite) in which no bacteria
has grown due to susceptibility of the bacterium to the drug. The
rate of drug diffusion through agar can be governed by many different
factors such as relative hydrophobicity, aqueous solubility, molecular
weight, and intrinsic resistance of the microorganism.45 These ZOI values confirm that drug release occurred
from the composites into the agar. The 1:1 composite loaded with [CHX][Ceph]
had larger zone diameters than the 2:1 composite of the same drug
(Table 3). However,
an opposing trend was seen for zone diameters of [CHX][Oxa] (Table 4). Overall, [CHX][Oxa]
produced larger ZOIs versus [CHX][Ceph]. This could be due to the
higher susceptibility of S. aureus to
[CHX][Oxa] as the standard disks impregnated with [CHX][Oxa] produced
larger zone diameters than [CHX][Ceph]. Moreover, it has been proven
in previous studies that the water solubility of [CHX][Oxa] is higher
than that of [CHX][Ceph], which allowed for better diffusion of this
drug through agar.46 Evaluation of data
shows that the porous nature of these biopolymer composites allows
for drug release, and this method of drug delivery has the potential
for minimizing staph infections. Representative images of incubated
agar plates with drug-loaded composites and standard disks can be
found in the Supporting Information (Figure S17).

Conclusions
In summary, hyaluronic acid/cellulose-based
composites were developed
by the dissolution of biopolymers in [Bmim][Cl], an ionic liquid,
with no chemical modification. These composites were developed at
two ratios (1:1 and 2:1 HA to CEL) and showed a variety of morphological
and structural changes that may prove applicable for wound care devices.
Since IL can be removed from the composite material through washing
with water and recovered by lyophilization, this method is also recyclable.
Several spectroscopic and imaging techniques, including FT-IR, TGA,
XRD, and SEM, were used for characterizing the composite material
and monitoring [Bmim][Cl] recovery. These composites showed great
swelling capacity with the 2:1 composite exhibiting a much higher
capacity. This could translate into an ability to absorb more wound
exudate.

By loading with antimicrobial GUMBOS, these composites
demonstrated
their use as possible medicated devices for use in wound care. When
both composites were drop-casted with the drug, there was uniform
coverage on both materials. In drug release studies, burst release
was seen from these composite materials with a higher release of the
drug from 1:1 composite. Examination of results of in vitro disk diffusion
tests showed that both composites allowed the diffusion of the drug
into the medium for combating S. aureus infections. These results, in combination with inherent biocompatibility,
strongly suggest potential biomedical applications of these composites.
We will further investigate (1) the incorporation of drug materials
within the composite network and (2) in vivo wound-healing properties
of these composites using animal models.

Chemicals and Materials
Cellulose (medium, fibrous from cotton linters), silver nitrate,
oxacillin sodium salt, and cephalothin sodium salt were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich. Hyaluronic acid sodium salt (1.5–2.2 MDa) and
chlorhexidine diacetate were obtained from Acros Organics. 1-Chlorobutane
was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Methylimidazole was obtained from TCI
Chemicals. S. aureus (ATCC 29213) was
grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth and subcultured on mannitol
salt agar. Inoculates were prepared in BHI and spread on Mueller–Hinton
agar. All growth media was obtained from Accumedia.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis and Characterization of HA/Cellulose Composite
Composites were fabricated in various ratios (1:1, 1:2, 2:1, 1:4,
and 4:1) of hyaluronic acid to cellulose and did not exceed 5% w/w
HA. However, 1:1 and 2:1 (HA/CEL) yielded the most stable composites
that did not wash away upon the removal of [Bmim][Cl]; thus, this
manuscript focuses only on these two ratios. Composites were fabricated
by first dissolving sodium hyaluronan (5% w/w) in [Bmim][Cl] and were
synthesized according to procedures reported in the literature by
Crowhurst et al.47 The solution was stirred
in a vial at 90–100 °C in a mineral oil bath. Once all
HA was dissolved, CEL (2.5 or 5% w/w) was added in 10% increments
to the vial. After CEL dissolved and the solution homogenized, the
mixture was transferred to a silicone mold and placed in a refrigerator
overnight to allow gel formation. The ionic liquid, [Bmim][Cl], was
recovered by soaking the composite in deionized water. Water was subsequently
removed from [Bmim][Cl] by lyophilization. Confirmation of [Bmim][Cl]
removal was concluded using FT-IR characterization and is detailed
in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.
Silver nitrate (AgNO3) ion test was also performed to confirm
the removal of all [Bmim][Cl] from the composite. These composites
were cut to size (1.27 cm × 1.27 cm), lyophilized overnight,
and stored on the benchtop. Most notably, no cross-linking agents
or chemical modifications were used in this synthesis. These HA/CEL-based
composites were then characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). They were also evaluated
for swelling capacity and drug release properties.

Synthesis and
Characterization of Chlorhexidine-Based GUMBOS
Chlorhexidine-di
cephalothin ([CHX][Ceph]) and chlorhexidine-di
oxacillin ([CHX][Oxa]) GUMBOS were synthesized by ion-exchange procedures
similar to those reported in the literature.30 Antibacterial susceptibility to various multidrug-resistant Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as cell viability, has been previously
reported by Cole et al.30 These GUMBOS
have also been shown to have increased pharmacokinetic properties,
as well as increased intestinal bioavailability.30

Swelling Capacity
Dried composites
were weighed and
soaked in various media, such as 0.9% saline solution, distilled water,
and 1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4), at room temperature for up to 3 h.
Weights of the wetted composites were measured at defined intervals
for up to 3 h. Prior to weighing, filter paper was wiped across the
surface of the composite to remove excess water. The swelling percent
(S%) was determined using the following equation 2  In eq 2, Wd is the weight of the dried
composite and Ws is the weight of the
respective swollen composite. The swelling percent is defined as the
fractional increase in the composite weight due to absorption. All
swelling studies were performed in triplicate.

Drug Loading
The
drugs [CHX][Ceph] and [CHX][Oxa] were
dissolved in methanol and diluted to the desired concentration in
500 μL of methanol. Fifty microliters of the solution was drop-casted
repeatedly onto the composite with the evaporation of methanol between
each loading. It is presumed that drug loading is 100%. The composite
was then dried overnight using evaporation to ensure complete removal
of methanol.

Drug Release
Composites were placed
in vials with 5
mL of a 0.9% saline solution and were constantly shaken using a VWR
S-500 orbital shaker at room temperature. At fixed time intervals,
4 mL of a 0.9% saline solution was removed and replaced with an equal
volume of fresh saline to maintain a constant volume. The amount of
drug released was assayed using a Shimadzu UV-3101PC UV–vis–near-infrared
(NIR) spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Europe) at λ = 231 nm. All
drug release studies were performed in triplicate.

Kirby–Bauer
Disk Diffusion
Testing was performed
according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
recommended procedures.48 Kirby–Bauer
disk diffusion assays44,45 were performed on S. aureus (ATCC 29213) to qualitatively demonstrate
that therapeutic agents can be released from these dry composites
and thus could minimize potential bacterial infections. Before lyophilization,
composites were molded with a 7 mm plastic straw. These rounds were
freeze-dried overnight and subsequently impregnated with therapeutic
agents. Controls containing the same concentration of therapeutic
agents were prepared using standard 6 mm paper disks to effectively
compare the bacterial control relative to the composite. S. aureus was grown in a brain heart infusion (BHI)
medium for 24 h and subcultured onto mannitol salt agar. Inoculum
matching a 1.0 McFarland standard was prepared in the BHI medium and
spread evenly over the surface of a Mueller–Hinton agar plate
to allow a confluent lawn of growth. Composite rounds and disks were
placed on the agar plate and incubated upside down for 20–24
h at 37 °C. After incubation, zones of inhibition had formed
around the composites and standard disks. Zone diameters were measured
using a ruler. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
