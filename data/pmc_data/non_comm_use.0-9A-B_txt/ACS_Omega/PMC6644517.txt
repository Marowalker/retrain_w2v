Because
of the low selectivity and efficiency of normal antitumor
agents, the strategy of ligand-targeted drugs was put forward. In
this paper, we designed and synthesized a new bioreductive linker
based on 2-nitroimidazole, which was used in three paclitaxel (PTX)
prodrugs. The drug release mechanism via six-membered ring was demonstrated
by chemical reduction and nitroreductase assay. Glucose and acetazolamide,
which have been reported widely as ligands, were attached to compound 7 to afford Glu-PTX and AZO-PTX. The prodrugs were considerably
stable in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and plasma. What is more,
PTX releasing could be triggered by nitroreductase rapidly. In in
vitro cytotoxicity assay, the prodrugs exhibited moderate selectivity
toward hypoxic tumor cells. We considered that the 2-nitroimidazole
linker could accelerate the release of prodrugs under hypoxic condition.
It was promising in the development of ligand-targeted drugs.

==== Body
1 Introduction
PTX
(paclitaxel) exhibits a high antitumor efficiency in clinical,
especially for ovarian, breast, and lung cancer.1,2 However,
PTX has many challenges in side effects, solubility, and drug resistance.3,4 In order to solve these problems and achieve precise treatment,
the development of ligand-targeted drugs represents an attractive
strategy.

Ligand-targeted drug links a targeting ligand and
therapeutic agent
through a spacer and cleavable linker. Among them, the cleavable linker
acts as the most important role for drug release. An ideally designed
cleavable linker could realize the drug stability during circulation
in vivo and could be cleaved rapidly at the targeted site. Reductively
cleavable linker, enzyme-cleavable linker, and acid-cleavable linker
are often used in ligand-targeted drugs’ design.5,6

Hypoxia is one of the most notable features in solid tumors,
as
well as a compelling therapeutic target.7−9 The insufficient supply
of blood from the disorganized vasculature results in the generation
of low oxygen regions in the center of solid tumors. The presence
of hypoxia in solid tumors brings about multiple contributions to
chemo resistance and radio resistance and particularly induces the
high expression of reductase.10,11 2-Nitroimidazole has
been demonstrated to be selectively reduced via reductase under hypoxic
condition. It has been widely used in the development of bioreductive
prodrugs and imaging agents.12−15

In this paper, we synthesized a new branched
linker on the basis
of 2-nitroimidazole for the ligand-targeted drug system. PTX was used
as a therapeutic agent. Usually, connecting functional fragment at
2′-OH of PTX via ester bond was a common strategy.16 However, some ester prodrugs were too stable
in preclinical studies and ultimately could not sufficiently release
the active drug. Therefore, we introduced pivalic acid at N – 1 position of 2-nitroimidazole and connected
it to 2′-OH of PTX via ester bond. In our design, 2-nitroimidazole
could be reduced to 2-aminoimidazole, then forming six-membered ring
to release PTX. Furthermore, 2-nitroimidazole was branched at C-4
position to conjugate with the well-studied ligands, glucose and acetazolamide.
In summary, we developed a new branched 2-nitroimidazole linker for
ligand-targeted drugs of PTX, which could be stable in physiological
conditions and rapidly release active drug under hypoxic condition.

2 Results and Discussion
Compound 4 was
synthesized facilely according to the
following Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 (a) LDA, Tetrahydrofuran (THF), −78 °C; (b) Cs2CO3, Dimethylformamide (DMF), 99%
The chemical reduction of compound 4 by Pd/C
in MeOH
under H2 atmosphere was used to test whether the six-membered
ring could be formed (Scheme 2). The reaction was confirmed to be totally converted to compound 4-b by H NMR (Supporting Information) and LC/MS (ESI: m/z: C8H11N3O [M + H]+ calcd, 166.09; found,
165.99). This result indicated that the drug release via six-membered
ring was reasonable.

Scheme 2 Chemical Reduction of Compound 4
PTX was connected to compound 5 to afford compound
IMI-PTX (Scheme 3).
We tested the stability of IMI-PTX in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
(pH = 7.4), human plasma, and mouse plasma in vitro (Figure 1). After 24 h incubation in
PBS, there was 65% IMI-PTX remained. The half time of IMI-PTX was
24 h in human plasma and 4 h in mouse plasma. The results were in
accord with previous studies that the high level of esterase in mouse
plasma could promote the ester bond hydrolysis.17,18 Overall, compound IMI-PTX was sufficiently stable for further evaluation.

(DMAP), EDCI, dichloromethane
(DCM)
Nitroreductase was used to
test bioreductive efficiency. Compound
IMI-PTX (10 μM) dissolved in pH 7.4 PBS and then incubated with
NADPH (1 μM) and nitroreductase (50 μg/mL) at 37 °C;
the drug release data were given by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). As a result, 45% of IMI-PTX remained after 1 h incubation
and 42% PTX was found to be released (Figure 2). It indicated that IMI-PTX could be metabolized
by nitroreductase and release PTX rapidly via six-membered ring mechanism.
The results encouraged us for further study of the 2-nitroimidazole
linker.

NADPH.

On the basis of the above studies,
we designed and synthesized
the 2-nitroimidazole liker (compound 7), which was branched
at the C-4 position of compound 5 (Supporting Information, S5). Compound 7 could
be connected to PTX via ester bond and conjugated to ligands through
click reaction.

Glucose and acetazolamide were well-studied
ligands. Glucose was
the basic energy molecule. The uptake of glucose would be increased
in tumor cells especially in hypoxic tumor cells. Glucose was used
as a targeting ligand in antitumor drugs such as glufosfamide.19,20 Acetazolamide was used as a CA IX inhibitor which was reported by
Neri recently.21 CA IX was highly expressed
in hypoxic tumor cells.22,23 For above reasons,
glucose and acetazolamide were chosen as targeting ligands. At the
same time, tetraglycol was connected between ligands and 2-nitroimidazole
linker to improve the aqueous solubility. Finally, two PTX prodrugs,
compound GLU-PTX and compound AZO-PTX, were synthesized (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 (a) (i) DMAP, EDCI,
DCM, 51%; (ii) CuI, N,N-Diisopropylethylamine
(DIPEA), n-BuOH,
H2O, 40%
We evaluated the stability and the bioreductive efficiency
of two
compounds at the same conditions. In mouse plasma, the half time of
AZO-PTX, GLU-PTX, and IMI-PTX was almost 4 h (Figure 3). The stability had no obvious change. In
vitro nitroreductase assay, GLU-PTX released 95% PTX (Figure 4) and AZO-PTX released 63%
PTX (Figure 5). The
PTX releasing ratio was differently increased compared with IMI-PTX.
We considered that the increase of aqueous solubility of two compounds
may contribute to their bioreductive efficiency.

GLU-PTX, and AZO-PTX in mouse plasma.

The compounds were tested for their in vitro inhibition of
H460
and HT29 proliferation under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. H460
and HT29 cell lines have been proven that overexpress of reductase,
which could be conducive to increase the toxicity of the prodrugs
under hypoxic conditions. The cells were incubated with the test compounds
at various concentrations for 72 h under normoxic or hypoxic conditions.
The in vitro cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT. The inhibition results
are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Three compounds exhibited 1.1–2.2
selective ratios toward hypoxic tumor cells.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized
a new bioreductive linker based on
2-nitroimidazole, which was used in three PTX prodrugs. The drug release
mechanism via six-membered ring was demonstrated by chemical reduction
and nitroreductase assay. The prodrugs were considerably stable in
PBS (pH 7.4) and plasma. What is more, PTX releasing could be triggered
by nitroreductase rapidly. In in vitro cytotoxicity assay, the prodrugs
exhibited moderate selectivity toward hypoxic tumor cells. We considered
that the new 2-nitroimidazole linker could accelerate the release
of prodrugs under hypoxic condition. The branched 2-nitroimidazole
linker was promising in the development of ligand-targeted drugs.
