A critical aspect in the bottom-up
construction of a synthetic
minimal cell is to develop an entity that is capable of self-reproduction.
A key role in this process is the expansion and division of the boundary
layer that surrounds the compartment, a process in which content loss
has to be avoided and the barrier function maintained. Here, we describe
the latest developments regarding self-reproduction of a boundary
layer with a focus on the growth and division of phospholipid-based
membranes in the context of a synthetic minimal cell.

Introduction
One of the main challenges in the field
of synthetic biology is
the bottom-up construction of a minimal cell. Such synthetic systems
would contain only a minimum of cellular components (nucleic acids,
enzymes, lipids, etc.), thereby creating a “living cell”
capable of executing basic functions among which are growth, replication,
and division.1 The interest in developing
synthetic cells is manifold. It will provide a deeper understanding
on how processes in cells interact, and define the minimal requirement
for “life”. Moreover, synthetic cells may open new fields
of application. This is already evident for nonreproductive synthetic
cells that are applied in cancer treatment, antibacterial studies,
and directed evolution.2−4 The ability to self-reproduce will further extend
the functionality of such systems.

By using the bottom-up approach,
first subcellular modules like
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation, phospholipid biosynthesis,
protein synthesis, etc. are created, which later are assembled together,
finally resulting in a self-sustaining minimal cell mimic.5 Essentially, a synthetic cell should be encoded
by a minimal genome that specifies all essential functions and that
allows the cells to thrive by coordinated transcription–translation.
Such minimal systems do not contain complex networks and interactions
that are present in living organisms, which creates an advantage as
it allows to study biological processes with minimal undesired interference.
At the same time, this also makes the system more vulnerable as it
will lack the robustness and flexibility of a regulated cell. The
bottom-up construction of a synthetic cell is to some extent similar
to early life forms or protocells that emerged at the origin of life.
Although a precise definition of such a minimal form of life remains
elusive and is under debate, there is consensus regarding some critical
elements for life, which include self-organization into a compartment.6 A compartment defines a confined space that allows
for crowding of molecules, which is essential for chemical reactions.7 Furthermore, compartmentalization permits for
distinct conditions in the interior of the synthetic cell, which is
crucial for metabolism. Although compartmentalized metabolism is a
reasonable description of a living entity, obviously a missing characteristic
is the ability to self-reproduce, as the compartment should be able
to grow and divide. Here, we will discuss the self-reproduction of
compartments in the context of the bottom-up construction of a synthetic
minimal cell. Specifically, we focus on the growth and division of
the surrounding boundary layer and discuss the necessities providing
communication across this barrier.

Results and Discussion
Compartmental
Self-Reproduction Based on Fatty Acids
In the development
of a synthetic cell, the simplest design of a
self-reproducing compartment would be growth by spontaneous insertion
of new building blocks, resulting in expansion, followed by spontaneous
division. Fatty acid-based vesicles are extremely suitable for this
purpose.8,9 Fatty acids can appear as monomers, micelles,
as well as membranes (Figure 1A). Their chemical properties allow them to rapidly interchange
between these different phases, thus resulting in compartmental growth
by spontaneous insertion.8,10 The group of Szostak
pioneered the use of self-reproducing fatty acid-based vesicles in
the context of the origin of life.11,12 By simply
feeding fatty acid vesicles with micelles, the vesicles grow by spontaneous
integration of new fatty acids. This phenomenon has been extensively
studied13 and further developed. An active
ribosome-like dipeptide catalyst encapsulated in such a vesicle was
able to synthesize a new dipeptide. As binding of this dipeptide to
the fatty acid vesicle membrane resulted in enhanced fatty acid incorporation,
vesicle growth was stimulated, thereby providing an evolutionary advantage.14 In another example, vesicular growth is linked
to the initiation of enzymatic activity. By adding new fatty acids
to overcrowded ribozyme- and oligonucleotide-containing fatty acid
vesicles, compartment expansion caused internal dilution, which in
turn activated ribozyme activity. Noteworthy, as the ribozyme activity
per unit volume during the protocell volume-change remained constant,
the system shows homeostatic behavior.15

Figure 1 Schematic
representation of compartment self-reproduction based
on fatty acids. (a) Fatty acids appearing as monomers, micelles, and
vesicles. (b) Fatty acid vesicles grown by a slow feed with micelles
transform into long threadlike vesicles and ultimately divide.

For self-reproduction, the growth
of fatty acid vesicles could
be combined with division (Figure 1B). By slowly growing these vesicles with fatty acid
micelles, spherical vesicles transform into long threadlike vesicles,
which minimizes content loss during division.16 This was demonstrated with RNA-encapsulated vesicles. Daughter cells
containing this RNA could be observed after multiple divisions, mimicking
a possible early and simple form of life. The observed vesicle fission
is caused by an imbalance of fatty acids between the two membrane
leaflets.17 In another approach, vesicles
were fed with fatty acids formed by a simple nonenzymatic synthesis
reaction, thereby coupling compartmental growth and division to a
primitive form of lipid synthesis.18

Phospholipid-Based Membranes
Although fatty acid-based
membranes are extremely useful in understanding the basics and principles
of a self-reproducing system, the ability of fatty acids to rapidly
migrate in and out of the membranes makes such compartments intrinsically
unstable.11 Furthermore, fatty acids are
only able to encapsulate a rather small intravesicular volume, too
small to support multienzymatic reactions and are, for this reason,
unsuitable to function as compartments for a synthetic minimal cell.
Indeed, biological membranes consist of more complex molecules, of
which phospholipids are the major component. They are uniformly present
in all life, and their amphipathic character allows them to self-assemble
in bilayer-like structures, thereby forming the barrier between the
interior cytoplasm and the exterior environment. Furthermore, phospholipid
membranes are equipped with additional functions as they are involved
in a wide variety of processes (signal transduction, solute transport,
DNA replication, protein targeting, etc.).19 Hence, the boundary layer of a synthetic minimal cell should exist
out of phospholipids. For example, phospholipid vesicles would be
suitable as they can be easily formed by multiple techniques and are
already widely used.20 A good prototype
for such a phospholipid boundary layer is the inner membrane of the
model organism Escherichia coli, which
has been studied in great detail.21 It
exists almost completely out of the zwitterionic phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine
(PE, 70–75%), the anionic phosphatidylglycerol (PG, 20–25%),
and, depending on the growth phase, varying amounts of cardiolipin
(CL, 0–10%). While CL is nonessential, a proper balance between
the bilayer forming PG and the nonbilayer PE is needed for proper
functioning of membrane proteins.22

Expansion
of Phospholipid Membranes
Unlike fatty acids,
the chemical properties of phospholipids do not allow them to rapidly
exchange between membranes and/or phases, meaning they are permanently
localized. Hence, phospholipid membranes cannot self-reproduce via
spontaneous incorporation of externally added phospholipid molecules.
Instead, membrane expansion is a process in which phospholipid biosynthesis
is combined with insertion. Phospholipid biosynthesis is a complex
process, and most of the current knowledge is based on the pioneering
biochemical research done by Kennedy and co-workers on E. coli.23,24 This process can be
divided into three different subsections: acyl chain biosynthesis,
phosphatidic acid (PA) formation, and introduction of polar headgroup
specificity (Figure 2).25 In the next section, these processes
are discussed within the context of the construction of a synthetic
cell.

Figure 2 Phospholipid biosynthesis in E. coli as a template for general phospholipid synthesis in bacteria. (a)
Acyl chain synthesis, followed by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), PA,
and cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) formation. (b) Polar
headgroup incorporation. Note: the phosphatidylserine synthase A (PssA)
enzyme is displayed integrally in the membrane as most commonly in
bacteria; however, in E. coli, this
is a soluble protein attaching to the membrane.

Acyl Chain Biosynthesis
Phospholipid synthesis begins
with the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids that need to be covalently
attached to the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) backbone,
which occurs via formation of a thioester. As this coupling requires
energy, the fatty acid is initially linked to an energy-containing
group: acyl-carrier protein (ACP) or coenzyme A (CoA). In E. coli, these acyl–acyl donor complexes are
mainly produced by the fatty acid synthetase-II (FAS-II), a multicomplex
enzyme that combines the construction of long fatty acid chains, together
with the linkage toward ACP (Figure 2A).26 As a first step toward
in vitro fatty acid biosynthesis, purified FAS from E. coli was shown to be capable of producing acyl-ACP
and fatty acid derivatives from the substrates acetyl- and malony-CoA.27,28 Later, in vitro fatty acid synthesis could be combined with glycolytic
enzymes and pyruvate dehydrogenase, to complete an in vitro reconstituted
system capable of converting glucose into fatty acid.29 This system could potentially form a module in a synthetic
minimal cell; however, it comprises a large amount of enzymes, which
complicates its applicability. As an alternative for the multicomplex
enzyme FAS-II, FAS-I could be used, a huge single enzyme that consists
of multiple subdomains, thereby simplifying its in vitro applications.30 The corresponding enzyme from Brevibacterium
ammoniagenes (Corynebacterium ammoniagenes) has been purified, reconstituted into liposomes, and shown to synthesize
fatty acids.31 The fatty acids inserted
spontaneously into the lipid bilayer, thus showing compartment expansion
via enzymatic fatty acid synthesis.32 Although
the in vitro application of fatty acid synthetases (FAS) can yield
substantial product, the complexity of the FAS enzyme makes it difficult
to control the composition of the fatty acid products and is therefore
less suitable for the development of synthetic cells.

A more
efficient route for the biosynthesis of acyl–acyl donor complexes
comprises the β-oxidation of free fatty acids. Here, fatty acids
are directly coupled to a CoA moiety by the enzyme FadD, thereby bypassing
the complex synthesis of fatty acids (Figure 2A).33 By mixing
fatty acids, ATP and CoA with purified FadD, a wide variety of FA-CoA
could be produced in vitro.34 Due to the
simplicity and versatility of this enzymatic reaction, FadD is a suitable
candidate for the initial step in in vitro phospholipid biosynthesis
as demonstrated in coupled enzymatic reactions that resulted in the
synthesis of phosphatidic acid, with a fatty acid composition dictated
by the feed with free fatty acids.35

Phosphatidic Acid Biosynthesis
Phosphatidic acid (PA)
comprises a G3P attached to two fatty acids, which makes it the simplest
form of a phospholipid. It is an essential intermediate in phospholipid
biosynthesis. In E. coli, two membrane-associated
proteins are responsible for these acylation reactions, i.e., glycerol-3-phosphate
acyltransferase (PlsB) and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (PlsC)
(Figure 2A).36,37 PlsB attaches the acyl chain from both acyl donors acyl-CoA and
acyl-ACP to the 1-position of G3P via formation of a new thioester,
finally resulting in the synthesis of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA).38 PlsB is an inner membrane acyltransferase that
requires the presence of a phospholipid membrane for activity.35,39 Hence, for the development of a synthetic cell, preexisting vesicles
need to be supplied, as membranes cannot be formed de novo. As an
alternative for PlsB, the enzyme tandem PlsX–PlsY, commonly
found in bacteria, could be used (Figure 2A).40 However,
as PlsY is an integral membrane protein, it is expected to require
a membrane for its activity as well.41

PlsC is a membrane protein that attaches another acyl–acyl
donor moiety to the 2-position of LPA, resulting in the formation
of PA (Figure 2A).42 Unlike PlsB, this enzyme does not strictly require
a membrane for its activity, although the presence of a membrane seems
to enhance its activity.35

An in
vitro system based on PlsB and PlsC should in principle be
capable of mimicking an expanding phospholipid-based boundary layer.
Indeed, by combining the PlsB- and PlsC-based enzymatic reactions
with FadD-mediated formation of acyl-CoA, phospholipids could be produced
from simple fatty acid building blocks, resulting in expansion of
the membrane.35 In this system, PlsB was
found to incorporate both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, whereas
PlsC shows a preference for unsaturated fatty acids. A similar observation
was made by analyzing the lipidome of E. coli, in which the sn-1 site is mainly occupied by oleic acid (C18:1)
and palmitic acid (C16:0), whereas mostly unsaturated fatty acids
are present at the sn-2 position.26,43 Notably, PlsB-
and PlsC-mediated production of PA has also been established through
in vitro-based transcription–translation of these enzymes.44,45 Currently, however, the yield of those reactions is too low to observe
any appreciable membrane expansion.

Polar Headgroup Incorporation
As final steps in phospholipid
biosynthesis, alcohols are introduced onto PA as polar head groups.
While there is a huge variety in nature, all key phospholipid species
are derived from the central precursor CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG)
(Figure 2B). CDP-DAG
synthesis is catalyzed by the Mg2+-dependent enzyme CDP-diacylglycerol
synthase (CdsA), which hydrolyzes a pyrophosphate from cytidine triphosphate,
thereby coupling a cytidine monophosphate (CMP) to PA (Figure 2B).46 CdsA consists mostly of transmembrane spanning segments.47 The structure of Cds from Thermotoga
maritima, which is a homologue of the E. coli CdsA, shows the presence of nine transmembrane
helices that are arranged into a novel fold with three domains.48 CdsA has been reconstituted into liposomes,
and in conjunction with FadD, PlsB, and PlsC, CDP-DAG can be synthesized
from simple building blocks.35 However,
since CDP-DAG is an inhibitor of CdsA activity, bulk production of
phospholipids is only possible when the downstream polar headgroup
enzymes are included as well. Here, the biosynthesis pathway splits
into different directions depending of the phospholipid species produced.

To synthesize PE from CDP-DAG, two additional conversions are necessary
(Figure 2B). First,
CDP-DAG is converted into phosphatidylserine (PS) by PS synthase (PssA),
which replaces the CMP moiety with a serine.49,50 Next, PS can be converted into PE by the membrane protein PS decarboxylase
(Psd), by decarboxylation of PS.51 PG is
synthesized via the conversion of CDP-DAG into phosphatidylglycerol-3-phosphate
(PGP) by PGP synthase (PgsA), followed by the removal of the 3-phosphate
by a PGP phosphatase, most notably by PgpA52 (Figure 2B). PG serves
as a substrate for the synthesis of cardiolipin, a conversion that
in E. coli is catalyzed by one of the
three cardiolipin synthetases (ClsA, ClsB, or ClsC) (Figure 2B). Like most bacterial cardiolipin-synthesizing
enzymes, ClsA and ClsB use two PG molecules as substrate.53 In this process, the glycerol head group of
one PG molecule is coupled to the phosphate of the other PG molecule
that serves as a phosphatidyl donor. This results in the formation
of cardiolipin and glycerol. However, ClsC uses PE instead of PG as
phosphatidyl donor, which results in an ethanolamine leaving group.54 Interestingly, cardiolipin-synthesizing enzymes
appear to be responsible for the production of multiple other phospholipid
species as well, most likely via incorporation of an alcohol during
the reverse reaction of cardiolipin hydrolysis.55,56 The aforementioned enzymes (CdsA, PssA, Psd, PgsA, and PgpA) have
been purified and coreconstituted into liposomes allowing for the
biosynthesis of PE and PG from PA.57 Moreover,
this enzymatic cascade could be coupled to the in vitro synthesis
of PA from fatty acids and G3P, yielding the essential phospholipid
species PE and PG in a membrane-expanding system.35 In a similar approach, the in vitro biosynthesis of multiple
phospholipids species was demonstrated by cell-free gene-encoded enzymes,58 albeit with low efficiency.

Homeostasis
of the Membrane Composition
In E. coli, the ratio between the phospholipid species
PE and PG is crucial for membrane functioning and is maintained constant
under all conditions.25,59 Therefore, phospholipid homeostasis
may be critical for the synthetic cell as well. How this balance is
maintained is unknown, but it likely involves transcriptional regulation.
By varying the concentrations of the enzymes involved in the synthesis
of PE and PG, a liposomal membrane containing a 70:30 ratio of these
two phospholipid species could be obtained that mimics the features
of the E. coli inner membrane.35 Obviously, in a transcription–translation-based
synthetic cell, the elements that ensure phospholipid homeostasis
most likely will be absent. Therefore, a proper balance of the expression
of the various phospholipids will be critical. However, some self-regulatory
mechanisms at the protein level are present as well, as the PssA enzyme
from E. coli can only associate with
the membrane in the presence of sufficient anionic lipid, thereby
stabilizing the balance between PG and PE.60,61

Phospholipid Flip-Flop
A crucial aspect of a continuously
growing phospholipid bilayer is the insertion of newly synthesized
phospholipids into both membrane leaflets. Since phospholipid biosynthesis
occurs asymmetrically at the membrane, i.e., at the inside of the
cell, phospholipid flip-flop may play a crucial role in membrane expansion.
Spontaneous flip-flop of phospholipids from one membrane leaflet to
the other is an extremely slow process62 and cannot keep up with the rate of biosynthesis. Therefore, it
is the general view that this process is catalyzed either by specific
enzymes termed flippases, floppases, or scramblases, or less specifically
along the surface of integral membrane proteins. Flippases do not
just balance the lipid composition on both leaflets of the membrane,
but also allow for an asymmetric distribution of a specific phospholipid
between those leaflets.63 Although in the
bacterial membrane, the enzymes responsible for phospholipid flip-flop
have not yet been identified, it is known that membrane-spanning proteins
in general can stimulate this process.62,64 Moreover,
introduction of certain phospholipid species in one of the leaflets
creates an unequal distribution of phospholipid species, which can
stimulate flip-flop as well.65

In
the in vitro phospholipid-synthesizing systems, phospholipid flip-flop
does not seem to play a role.35 Possibly,
the partitioning of fatty acids in the membrane causes local defects
in the bilayer, thereby stimulating flip-flop.66,67 At high concentrations, however, fatty acids interfere with the
membrane permeability barrier, which is an undesired phenomenon for
a synthetic cell. As recently a family of phospholipid flippases has
been discovered in fungi,68,69 introduction of such
membrane proteins may alleviate the potential asymmetry issues with
localized phospholipid biosynthesis in the synthetic cell once the
production of high levels of phospholipid is reached.

Chemical
Phospholipid Analogues and Compartmentalization
An alternative
for the natural synthesis of phospholipids is formed
by the nonenzymatic or chemical synthesis of phospholipid analogues.
Their synthesis can be relatively simple compared to biological phospholipid
synthesis, which provides a possible advantage. This is illustrated
by the coupling of an amphiphilic aldehyde to a lipophilic aniline
derivative, which forms a phospholipid-like amphiphile.70 As the synthesis occurred inside a vesicle consisting
of the same amphiphile, the formation of new vesicles represents self-reproduction.
Moreover, vesicle self-reproduction could be combined with intravesicular
DNA amplification, thereby coupling compartment self-reproduction
with self-replication of information. As the amplification of DNA
accelerated the division of the giant vesicles, this event provides
an evolutionary benefit.71 Interestingly,
the chemical synthesis of phospholipid opens the field of de novo
membrane formation as well. In nature, de novo membrane formation
appears to be impossible, as many of the enzymes involved in the synthesis
of phospholipids are membrane-associated or integrated proteins that
require the bilayer as a matrix to function properly. Chemical phospholipid
synthesis can circumvent the requirements of a complex enzymatic pathway.
Furthermore, the chemical substrates out of which a synthetic phospholipid
is built can be water-soluble, which makes them ideal candidates for
the de novo construction of membranes. One example showing de novo
bilayer formation is based on hybrid micelles consisting of a dodecylamine-containing
amphiphilic imine and an amphiphilic aldehyde. Transfer of the dodecylamine
onto the amphiphilic aldehyde within the hydrophobic environment of
the amphiphilic aggregates resulted in the transformation into phospholipid-like
giant vesicles.72

From a more biological
point of view, synthetic lipids with great similarity to a specific
natural phospholipid species were created as well. A copper-catalyzed
azide–alkyne cycloaddition resulted in the formation of a triazole-containing
phospholipid analogue of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC), thereby mimicking the attachment of a second acyl chain to
a lysophospholipid.73,74 To create even more biological
relevance, POPC-like phospholipids could be synthesized from thioesters
by applying native chemical ligation, thereby mimicking biological
acyl chain coupling.75 Moreover, the synthesis
of these POPC analogues could be combined with integral membrane protein
reconstitution, as the detergent analogue used for solubilizing the
membrane protein is part of the phospholipid synthesis.76,77 Altogether, these examples show that synthetic phospholipid analogous
have a great potential to form the boundary layer of a synthetic minimal
cell. Their synthesis can be simple compared to biological phospholipid
synthesis and not limited to a given subset of enzymes, which opens
a world for new phospholipid species. Nevertheless, the current variety
in chemical phospholipid analogues is still limited, and their functioning
in membrane-related processes is still barely resolved.

Functional
Phospholipid Membranes and Synthetic Cells
Cellular membranes
do not only function as impermeable barriers for
ions and other molecules, but also provide a matrix for membrane proteins
to act as an anchor site, promote folding, and support activity.19,78 Proteins embedded in, or associated with, the membrane play a pivotal
role in membrane functions. They facilitate transport of solutes (nutrients,
ions, signaling molecules, etc.) and macromolecules (proteins, oligosaccharides,
etc.) across the membrane. This enables regulatory processes of exchange
and communication between the interior of the cell and the environment,
processes which are critical for homeostasis and growth. Moreover,
membrane proteins function in intracellular processes as well, such
as DNA replication, protein targeting, etc..19 Evidently, a synthetic minimal cell should comprise membranes containing
membrane proteins.

Often membrane proteins rely on specific
physicochemical properties of specific lipids for proper functioning,
which is illustrated by the role of the two essential E. coli phospholipids PE and PG.

A strain in
which the Pss and Psd genes were inactivated, thus
lacking PE, is unable to grow and exhibits impaired motility and chemotaxis.79 However, this strain can be rescued by the presence
of high concentrations of divalent cations.80 This has been associated with the need for a nonbilayer type of
phospholipid for activity and functionality, as the high concentrations
of divalent cations can induce a conelike structure in PG, which is
the main phospholipid in this PE-deficient strain. Furthermore, some
membrane proteins require PE for folding as exemplified by the lactose
permease.81,82

Also, the anionic lipid PG is critical
for membrane protein functioning,
which in most cases can be attributed to the negative charge of the
head group. For instance, DNA associates with the membrane in a PG-dependent
manner, which involves the protein DnaA that in turn regulates the
initiation of DNA replication at the initiation site oriC. In this
process, DnaA associates with the membrane through the interaction
of an amphipathic helix with the anionic lipid head group of PG, which
is essential for replication.83,84 PG can further act
as a chaperone in protein folding during the insertion of proteins
into the membrane. This is illustrated by the PG-dependent folding
of co-translationally membrane-inserted MraY translocase85 and the assembly of the potassium channel KcsA.86

In E. coli, most proteins are inserted
into or translocated across the membrane by the Sec translocase.87,88 Translocation of proteins through the SecYEG pore, i.e., translocon,
is driven by SecA. Functioning of this ATP-ase is strictly dependent
on anionic phospholipids,89 which in E. coli mostly concerns PG. SecA interacts with the
membrane through its N-terminal amphipathic helix that inserts into
membranes containing anionic phospholipids. The aforementioned interaction
induces a conformational change onto SecA, which in turn promotes
the high-affinity interaction with the translocon concomitantly with
the activation of the SecA ATPase activity.90 Furthermore, the positively charged signal sequences of secretory
proteins convert into an α-helical configuration upon interaction
with the anionic phospholipids.91 This
dual function of PG was exploited to demonstrate a functional connection
between phospholipid biosynthesis and protein translocation in an
in vitro reconstituted system. Herein, the translocon was reconstituted
into a membrane lacking anionic phospholipids, whereupon the synthesis
of bulk quantities of PG was found to reactivate the translocon for
protein translocation (Figure 3) (Koch et al., unpublished data). The latter represents an
example of the functional integration of two biochemical modules in
the development of a functional expanding boundary layer of a synthetic
cell.

Figure 3 Schematic representation of anionic lipid-dependent translocon
activation. Anionic lipid-depleted proteoliposomes reconstituted with
SecYEG and enzymes involved in PG synthesis cannot translocate preproteins.
Introduction of the building blocks for PG allows for synthesis and
incorporation of this molecule into the liposomal membrane, thereby
activating the translocon for SecA-mediated protein translocation.

Division of Phospholipid
Vesicles
Although fatty acid
vesicles can spontaneously divide, phospholipid-based membranes need
to be divided to complete compartmental self-reproduction. While the
division of vesicles can be based on physical mechanisms or driven
by the chemical synthesis of materials,92 cellular life makes use of an enzymatic division machinery. In bacteria,
division occurs via contraction of a membrane-interacting ring located
at midcell, ultimately splitting the cell into two daughter cells
by invagination (Figure 4A).93 In bacteria and some archaea, division
is initiated by the formation of a proto-ring, which in its simplest
form comprises three proteins: filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant
Z (FtsZ), filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant A (FtsA), and ZipA.
FtsZ is a guanosine triphosphate-dependent protein that can assemble
into a protein polymer and form the so-called Z-ring. This ring can
associate with the membrane via an interaction of FtsZ with either
FtsA or ZipA, which have overlapping roles but are both essential
for subsequent division events. Interestingly, gain of function mutants
of FtsA can compensate for the loss of ZipA, thereby allowing for
functional proto-ring formation by only two enzymes.94,95

Figure 4 Division
of phospholipid-based compartments. (a) Contraction of
a membrane-anchored FtsZ invaginates the compartment, finally resulting
in division. (b) Oscillating Min-system ensures binary fission. (c)
Reconstitution of FtsZ in the presence of the Min-system allows for
proto-ring formation at midcell.

The positioning of the proto-ring at midcell is crucial.
In conjunction
with binary fission, this allows for the formation of the two daughter
cells with intracellular content identical to that of the mother cell
(Figure 4B). This process
ensures continued proliferation. The middle of a compartment can be
identified via polarization. In bacteria, correct placement of the
proto-ring is most commonly regulated by the Min-system. In E. coli, this system comprises the proteins Min C,
D, and E that creates polarity via formation of oscillating patterns
from cell-pole to cell-pole.96

The
in vitro division of phospholipid-based compartments starts
with reconstitution of the minimal divisome in liposomes. Some pioneering
work has been performed by the group of Schwille regarding in vitro
proto-ring formation and reconstitution of an oscillating Min-system
in the presence of a membrane.97,98 By simple reconstitution
of the Min-system, the proteins self-organize, which results in ATP-driven
oscillating waves.99 A more detailed study
on the dynamic behavior of the Min-system revealed that the observed
pole-to-pole oscillations are caused by the shape of the compartment,
as Min-systems reconstituted in other geometrical chambers allow for
spiral rotations and traveling waves as well.100,101 Noteworthy, the fraction of anionic lipid alters the oscillation
speed and width, thereby emphasizing the role of phospholipids in
membrane-related events.102 Although Min-oscillations
were well studied in vitro, only recently they have been successfully
reconstituted into giant unilamellar vesicles. As a result, several
different spatiotemporal patterns could be observed, in which the
oscillations applied such a force on the lipid bilayer that the vesicles
repeatedly showed to divide and form periodic buds.103

Unlike polarization, in vitro proto-ring formation
is far more
challenging, as the in vitro reconstitution of FtsZ and FtsA into
liposomes mostly results in the formation of fibers and clumps.104 Nevertheless, by using FtsZ fused to a membrane-targeting
amphipathic helix (FtsZ-mts), tubular membrane-associated structures
could be observed.105 Although no division
took place, these proteoliposomes were able to constrict, indicating
that FtsZ can generate contraction forces on its own. Remarkably,
replacement of FtsA with the FtsA gain of function mutant enabled
FtsZ to form proto-rings to some extent, and even a few dividing liposomes
could be detected in vitro.106 In an ambitious
attempt to extend FtsZ-based vesicle division, the proteins FtsZ,
FtsA, and ZipA were synthesized inside liposomes via cell-free translation.
Production of active protein was confirmed, as some FtsZ polymerization
as well as membrane localization was observed. However, this did not
result in Z-ring formation and/or division.107 To localize proto-ring formation to the middle of a compartment,
the in vitro assembly has to be combined with the polarizing oscillating
Min-system. Reconstitution of self-organized oscillations of Min CDE
proteins, resulting in a distinct protein concentration gradient,
directed the localization of FtsZ-mts to the middle of the compartment,
thereby mimicking Z-ring formation at midcell (Figure 4C).108 Although
this in vitro reconstituted system is not able to divide, it provides
a good starting point toward the controlled binary division of synthetic
cells.

Alternatively, a division machinery derived from the
archaeal domain
of life could be employed to divide liposomes. While the FtsZ-based
division system is predominantly found in Euryarchaea, Thaumarchaea,
and Korarchaea, at least two other division machineries have been
identified in other archaea. This concerns Cdv-mediated division in
Sulfolobales and Desulfurococcales (belonging to the Crenarchaea),
and fission based on the archaeal actin homologue crenactin, which
is present in Thermoproteales.109 The latter
system is poorly understood as most of the components involved still
need to be discovered.110 In contrast,
Cdv-mediated division is much better understood, as it is a paralogue
of the well-studied eukaryal endosomal sorting complex required for
transport III (ESCRT-III) complex, involved in, e.g., membrane abscission
during cytokinesis, exosome biogenesis, and multivesicular body formation.
The specific similarities and differences between these two systems
will not be discussed here, as it has been extensively reviewed.111 Essentially, the Cdv-division machinery comprises
three proteins: CdvA, CdvB, and CdvC, which, during constriction,
organize into a ringlike structure at the invagination site.112,113 To explore the in vitro potential of this system, initially CdvA
was reconstituted into liposomes, which was found to polymerize at
the membrane.114 Addition of CdvB deforms
the membrane as CdvB is recruited by CvdA, which finally results in
a network of connected membrane tubes, instead of a liposome.115 Although this partial reconstitution of the
Cdv-machinery into liposomes did not result in membrane division,
it is a promising alternative for FtsZ-based division. Perhaps proteins
of the eukaryal ESCRT-III complex can be used for division as the
liposomal encapsulation of the core proteins comprising this complex
induced the formation of internal vesicles by constraining and scission
of the liposomal membrane.116

Conclusions
and Outlook
In this review, we discussed the self-reproduction
of boundary
membrane layers, with respect to the bottom-up construction of a synthetic
minimal cell. A first step was made by the spontaneous growth and
division of fatty acid-based vesicles with minimal content loss. Although
engineering of these self-reproducing fatty acid vesicles provided
new insights, especially related to the origin of life, they are intrinsically
unstable and barely encapsulate a “cytosol”, which make
them unsuitable to function as barriers in a synthetic minimal cell.
Moreover, boundary layers do not only separate the interior from the
exterior, but are involved in a wide variety of processes, wherein
specific phospholipid species play a pivotal role. Hence, any approach
toward the engineering of a synthetic minimal cell should be based
on phospholipids or phospholipid-like structures. Expansion of phospholipid-based
liposomes could be realized by the insertion of multiple phospholipid
species, produced by a designed and engineered enzymatic phospholipid
biosynthesis pathway. Moreover, this could be coupled to the process
of protein translocation across the membrane, thereby introducing
transport across the membrane. Although these are promising developments
toward a functional boundary layer, a next challenge would be to establish
growth via a constant feed of precursor fatty acids, thereby allowing
for continued self-replication. Moreover, introduction of proteins
involved in transport across the membrane of other precursors involved
in phospholipid synthesis should allow for continued phospholipid
biosynthesis from within and mimicking growth of a synthetic minimal
cell.

Besides growth, a self-reproducing compartment should
be able to
divide. Initial attempts were based on co-reconstitution of a minimal
divisome with the polarizing Min-system. Recent developments allowed
for Z-ring formation at the midcell, thereby providing a promising
start toward binary fission, although alternatives to FtsZ such as
the Cdv-system should be considered as well. The current research
illustrates that in vitro engineering of division is not as easy as
simply reconstituting the enzymes, but is a complicated process that
requires detailed knowledge and a robust design. Linking continuous
growth of phospholipid liposomal membranes to division, based on the
reconstitution of purified enzymes, would provide an excellent starting
point for a self-reproducing compartment.

Eventually, a synthetic
minimal cell should rely on a DNA/RNA-based
information storage system. Currently, the limited performance and
complexity to synthesize many proteins simultaneously in a functional
state within a liposomal compartment presents a formidable challenge
in the bottom-up approach for building a synthetic cell. Moreover,
events involved in transcription and translation will influence the
enzymatically compartmental self-replication and vice versa. This
creates a complex interplay in which there will not only be beneficial
cross-talk, but also competition and incompatibilities are to be expected.
Obviously, by adding new modules in a synthetic minimal cell, the
complexity of controlling these processes will increase, and adequate
tuning is required. Hence, first simple systems based on purified
enzymes should be created, prior to their coupling with in vitro transcription/translation.
By establishing partially functional synthetic cells, complete integration
may become more feasible in the long run.
