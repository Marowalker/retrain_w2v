[ZrO]2+[CLP]2– (CLP: clindamycinphosphate)
inorganic–organic hybrid nanoparticles (IOH-NPs) represent
a novel strategy to treat persisting, recurrent infections with multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus. [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– is prepared in water and contains the approved antibiotic
with unprecedented high load (82 wt % CLP per nanoparticle). The IOH-NPs
result in 70–150-times higher antibiotic concentrations at
difficult-to-reach infection sites, offering new options for improved
drug delivery for chronic and difficult-to-treat infections.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
overuse and inappropriate application of antibiotics is well
known to lead to the emergence of antibiotic resistance—and
even more challenging—to an increase of multidrug resistances
(MDR) among several bacterial species.1 MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or
Gram-negative bacteria with extended-spectrum β-lactamase production
(e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) and among Gram-positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), have become a major problem for the global healthcare system by
increasing healthcare costs due to high morbidity and mortality rates
and prolonged hospitalization.2,3

A central issue
in the development of MDR bacteria is related to
the fact that classical treatment strategies often lead to insufficient
levels of anti-infectives in various niches of the host such as the
intracellular milieu, rendering the treatment less efficient and increasing
the threat that pathogens become resistant.2−6S. aureus, for example,
is known to establish intracellular infection reservoirs because of
internalization and persistence in several host cells (e.g., mast
cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, epithelial cells, and osteoblasts).3,7−11 Certain S. aureus subpopulations
(small colony variants) are even well adapted to persist for long
periods in the intracellular milieu,12−15 and they are associated with
chronic, relapsing, and therapy-refractory infections such as osteomyelitis
or cystic fibrosis.16−19

Promising concepts to conquer these problems and to restrict
antimicrobial
resistance relate to the development of new antimicrobial agents or—equally
important—the evolution of more efficient dosage forms of conventional
antibiotics for obtaining sufficient concentration levels in the intracellular
milieu to guarantee bacterial eradication.2−6 Typically, the maximum concentration of antibiotics,
however, is limited by solubility/availability (in blood, cells, tissue),
penetration (through membranes), retention time (due to biodegradation
or excretion), as well as by induced side effects. Higher concentrations
within the intracellular milieu could be achieved via more efficient
uptake into infected cells and tissue. In this regard, several nanoparticle-based
concepts were suggested (e.g., tuberculosis treatment)20,21 that use the different uptake of nanoparticles (i.e., phagocytosis
and pinocytosis) in comparison to molecular antibiotics in solution
(i.e., via ion channels or passive diffusion through lipid double
layers).22,23

Nanoparticle-based concepts for antibiotic
delivery predominately
relate to organic polymers and micelles24−27 as well as inorganic compounds
(e.g., SiO2, Fe2O3, Ag, and Au),20,21,28−34 in which the antibiotic is encapsulated. These concepts intrinsically
have the disadvantage of comparably low drug contents (typically <10
wt %) in mainly nonactive matrices as the majority material. In some
cases, moreover, elaborate, multistep synthesis is needed and/or the
particle size is too large (>150 nm) for what is considered as
optimal
for biomedical nanoparticle applications (50–100 nm).20,21,28−34 All in all, nanoparticular antibacterial agents appear to have great
potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial
infections.35−40

To address the challenge of intracellular MDR bacteria, we
here
suggest saline [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– inorganic–organic
hybrid nanoparticles (IOH-NPs) as a novel nanocontainer concept to
deliver antibiotics with extremely high concentration directly to S. aureus in intracellular niches. [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– is an insoluble, saline compound, made
in water, which contains an unprecedented high load of 82 wt % of
antibiotic [CLP]2– (CLP: clindamycinphosphate).
CLP is a clinically approved pro-drug for the active last resort antibiotic
clindamycin (CL).41,42 Both—CLP and CL—are
highly bacteriostatic, bactericidal (at higher concentration), and
widely used to treat staphylococcal infections—but by now only
in dissolved, free form.41,42

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Material Synthesis and
Characterization
[ZrO]2+[CLP]2– was prepared by injecting
an aqueous solution of ZrOCl2 × 8H2O to
aqueous solutions of Na2(CLP) at 55 °C (Figure 1a). The synthesis compares
to our previously presented concept of phosphate-based IOH-NPs with
a general composition [ZrO]2+[RFunctionOPO3]2–.43,44 Herein, the inorganic
cation [ZrO]2+ and a functional organic anion [RFunctionOPO3]2– together form a saline hybrid
material. [ZrO]2+ as the cation and a phosphate group as
part of the organic anion guarantee for the insolubility of the IOH-NPs
in water (Figure 1a).
On the basis of different functional organic anions, a wide range
of IOH-NPs entailing various functionalities such as fluorescence,
magnetism, or drug delivery can be realized so that the IOH-NPs become
suitable for multimodal imaging and/or cancer treatment (Supporting Information: Figure S1).43,44 Here, we can expand the material concept to antibiotic nanocarriers
for the first time. To obtain the saline [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs and colloidally stable suspensions, particle
nucleation and particle growth have to be performed precisely (Figure 1b; Supporting Information).45 [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– is insoluble in water and can be
easily suspended in polar solvents such as water, ethanol, diethylene
glycol, or biological buffers (e.g., HEPES and aqueous dextran). Slow
dissolution of the [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs
in an active metabolism—similar to CLP as conventional pro-drug
in solution—results in the release of CL as the active drug
in the presence of phosphatases.41,42

the water-based synthesis of [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs: (a) structure of antibiotic [CLP]2– anion;
(b) photograph of aqueous [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– suspension; (c + d) electron microscopy
of nanoparticles; and (e) FT-IR spectra [with Na2(CLP)
as reference].

On the basis of the good
availability of CL as a standard anti-infective
and the low-cost aqueous synthesis, [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs can be obtained in large quantities and concentrated suspensions
(up to 20 mg/mL). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 1c,d) confirms the presence
of spherical nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 44 ± 11 nm
(calculated by statistical evaluation of 100 particles). The hydrodynamic
diameter (73(14) nm) obtained via dynamic light scattering is as large
as the value obtained by SEM (Supporting Information: Figure S2), which can be ascribed to the high polarity of water
and the resulting expanded rigid solvent shell. Moreover, the absence
of any specific surface stabilizer on the as-prepared IOH-NPs needs
to be taken into account, which facilitates the synthesis and which
allows avoiding any eventual toxic effect of a stabilizer. Energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis (EDX), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
thermogravimetry (TG), and elemental analysis (EA) validate the chemical
composition of [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– as a new
compound. EDX and FT-IR qualitatively prove the presence of [ZrO]2+ and [CLP]2– (Figure 1e). Quantification via total organics combustion
(TG) shows a weight loss of 66% fitting well with the expectation
(calcd. 68%) (Supporting Information: Figure
S3). EA data of 33.0 wt % C, 5.6 wt % H, 5.6 wt % N, 4.6 wt % S also
agree with the expectation (calcd C: 35.0, H: 4.6, N: 5.3, S: 5.3
wt %).

2.2 Biocompatibility and Cell Uptake
Biocompatibility and cell uptake were verified by feeding [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs to murine bone marrow derived
macrophages (BMDMs)—a cell type generally showing high uptake
rates of nanoparticles.45 BMDMs were grown
in sterile 4-chamber slides to form confluent cell monolayers and
incubated for 6 h in the presence of [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs. Within this time period, numerous [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs were phagocytosed and appear within primary
lysosomes (pLs) either individually or as electron dense clusters
(Figure 2a,b: red circles,
red arrowheads). S. aureus cells are
characteristically dispersed within the cytoplasm of infected BMDMs
and actively grow within the state of binary fission (Figure 2c). To study the impact of
[ZrO]2+[CLP]2– on the viability of intracellular S. aureus, infected BMDMs were incubated for 4 h
(Figure 2d), 6 h (Figure 2e), and 12 h (Figure 2f,g) with [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs and examined by electron
microscopy. Within BMDMs, individual bacterial cells (BCs) appear
surrounded by clusters of [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– within in close distances <500 nm (Figure 2d,g: red stars). After 12 h of incubation
with [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs, the BC shows
electron transparencies produced by alterations within the cell wall/subcell
wall regions and the plane of binary fission that is associated with
an “en-gros” change in cell morphology (Figure 2g). Such cellular defects (CD:
black arrows) indicate antibiotic activity and death of the BC.

unstained macrophages, treated with [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– for 6 h (red arrowheads indicate IOH-NP clusters). (b) Detailed

Macrophages treated with [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– 12 h before infection with S. aureus and after 4, 6, and 12 h of incubation (IOH-NP clusters indicated
by red stars). Indicators: pL: primary lysosome, N: nucleus, BC: bacterial
cell, CD: cellular defects, bR: bacterial remnant.

To validate the presence of [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs within lysosomes, parallel electron energy-loss
spectroscopy
and electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI) were performed on unstained
40 nm ultrathin sections of uninfected and S. aureus-infected BMDMs incubated with [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs (Figure 3a,b; Supporting Information: Figure S4).
This allows discriminating [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs from other electron dense nanostructures such as ferritins
or Fe2O3 particles that can be present in BMDMs.
Accordingly, Zr-M45 elemental maps show distinct
Zr-M45 intensities, congruent with [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– clusters of pLs for uninfected (Figure 3a) and S. aureus-infected macrophages (Figure 3b), indicating the presence
and high load of internalized [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs. To validate efficient uptake and to ensure the intracellular
localization of the IOH-NPs, immunofluorescence microscopy was performed
using fluorescence-marked [ZrO]2+[(CLP)0.995(DUT)0.005]2– (DUT: dyomics-647 uridine
triphosphate; Supporting Information: Figure
S1) and gfp-expressing S. aureus bacteria
(gfp: green fluorescence protein). Similar to the results of EELS
and ESI, the macrophages are highly loaded with fluorescent IOH-NPs,
which are found in close proximity to the intracellular bacteria (Figure 3c,d). The data indicate
a potential localization of IOH-NPs within primary lysosomal compartments.
However, further co-localization studies (e.g., using lysotracker)
are needed to gain deeper insights in the molecular and cellular uptake
mechanisms of IOH-NPs into the host cells.

2.3 Antibiotic
Effect
Having demonstrated
that the [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs were
efficiently internalized by BMDMs, their potential toxic effect on
cell viability was assessed by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) released into the supernatant by [ZrO]2+[CLP]2–-treated BMDMs. Generally, the release of the cytoplasmic
enzyme LDH into the culture medium is an indication of plasma membrane
disruption and cell damage. However, no significant levels of LDH
were observed in the supernatant of [ZrO]2+[CLP]2–-treated and untreated BMDMs (Supporting Information: Figure S5). These results clearly indicate a lack of toxicity of
[ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs for BMDMs after
24 h of incubation.

To verify if [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs (in suspension) have an advantage over free
CLP (in solution) to kill intracellular S. aureus, professional phagocyte BMDMs and nonprofessional phagocytic human
epithelial Hep2 cells were infected with the S. aureus strain SH1000 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 bacteria per
1 eukaryotic cell for 1 h. The infection was followed by treatment
for 2 h with either [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– (suspension)
or dissolved CLP [i.e., solution of Na2(CLP)]. Untreated
infected cells were used for comparison. Cells were harvested 4 h
(nonhatched bars) and 24 h (hatched bars) after infection, washed
twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with ddH2O for 5 min to release intracellular bacteria. Thereafter,
the number of viable intracellular bacteria was counted after platting
serial dilutions on blood agar plates. As a result, the number of
viable intracellular bacteria is significantly lower in macrophages
(Figure 4a) as well
as in Hep2 cells (Figure 4b) after treatment with [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– (suspension) compared to untreated cells and cells treated with
dissolved CLP (solution). Most remarkably, solutions of free CLP do
not show any effect on BMDMs 4 h after infection (Figure 4a), whereas the IOH-NPs significantly
reduce the survival rate of intracellular S. aureus. In non-phagocytic Hep2 cells, a significant difference between
[ZrO]2+[CLP]2– (suspension) and dissolved
CLP was also obtained 24 h after infection (Figure 4b), clearly indicating the advantage of the
IOH-NP drug delivery concept for cells with low bacterial killing
ability. All in all, this clearly demonstrates that CL is significantly
more efficient at targeting intracellular S. aureus when delivered as [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs
than in the dissolved free form.

Figure 4 Intracellular survival of S. aureus within macrophages (BMDMs) (a) and epithelial
Hep2 cells (b) 4 h
(nonhatched bars) and 24 h (hatched bars) after infection (cells infected
for 1 h with an MOI of 10:1; level of intracellular bacteria 1 h after
infection referred to as 100%). Data with mean ± SD of three
experiments (***p < 0.0005, **p < 0.005, *p < 0.05).

To determine if the superior bactericidal efficiency of CL-loaded
[ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs over dissolved,
free CL is provoked by a more efficient antibiotic penetration and
retention in the intracellular milieu, the loading kinetics of either
[ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs (suspension) or
free CL (solution) into eukaryotic cells was analyzed in BMDMs. Hence,
BMDMs were incubated with [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs, dissolved CLP (Figure 5) and dissolved CL hydrochloride (CL, Supporting Information: Figure S6) for 1, 2, and 4 h. The
amount of intracellular CL was determined in BMDM lysates by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)–mass spectrometry (MS)/MS (Supporting Information) to determine the intracellular
CL levels (Figure 5; Supporting Information: Figure S6).

Figure 5 Intracellular
CL levels within macrophages 1, 2, and 4 h after
co-cultivation with [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs
and dissolved CLP at identical concentrations (50 μg CLP/mL):
(a) illustration of uptake and cell treatment; (b) internalized CL
after treatment with dissolved CLP (white bars), [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– (red bars), lysates of untreated cells
(negative control, gray bars). Data measured by HPLC–MS/MS;
mean ± SD of triplicate samples (***p < 0.001).

As a result, the internalized
CL concentration in macrophages turned
out to be 70-times higher after 1 h of incubation when treated with
[ZrO]2+[CLP]2– suspensions in comparison
to CLP and CL in solution (Figure 5b; Supporting Information: Figure S6, Tables S1, and S2). After 4 h, the internalized CL concentration
increases even further and is about 150-times higher after treatment
with [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– suspensions (Figure 5b; Supporting Information: Figure S6, Tables S1, and S2). The
intracellular levels of CLP reached 1.027 μg per mL in macrophages
incubated up to 4 h with the IOH-NPs (suspension). This concentration
exceeds the minimal inhibitory concentration of CLP, which was determined
as <0.625 μg per mL (Supporting Information: Figure S7). In contrast to the IOH-NP suspensions, the concentration
of intracellular CLP after co-cultivation of cells with dissolved
CLP remained in the subinhibitory range <0.02 μg per mL.
The significantly higher CLP levels reached via the IOH-NP treatment,
therefore, is highly promising to address and eventually to solve
the challenges related to MDR formation.

The remarkable increase
of CLP uptake using IOH-NPs can be attributed
to a more efficient uptake of the IOH-NPs by cellular processes such
as phago-/pinocytosis and the active acquisition of the IOH-NPs as
a phosphate source.43,44,46,47 These findings coincide with the efficient
uptake and the intracellular localization of the [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs as shown by EELS, ESI (Figure 3a,b), and immunofluorescence
microscopy (Figure 3c,d). The uptake of [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs
in BMDMs, finally, shows clear time and concentration dependency (Supporting Information: Figures S8 and S9). The
extremely high uptake of [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– by BMDMs can become even more interesting because macrophages can
abandon the blood system to attack S. aureus at difficult-to-reach niches of the host.48

3 Conclusions
In sum, [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs represent
a novel nanoparticle-based strategy to treat persisting and recurrent S. aureus-caused infections. [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– contains an unprecedented high amount (82 wt %) of
clinically approved CLP and shows high uptake at low toxicity. Most
interestingly, the IOH-NP suspensions allow 70–150-times higher
drug concentration (after 1–4 h of incubation) than the free
drug in solution at difficult-to-reach intracellular infection sites.
This offers unique options for improved drug delivery to eradicate
intracellular bacterial reservoirs during chronic and difficult-to-treat
infections. Because macrophages are not limited to the blood system,
they can—after loading with [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs—also attack multiresistant bacteria in various difficult-to-reach
niches of the host with the anti-infective in very high concentrations.
In principle, the material concept and delivery strategy can be also
transferred to other antibiotics as well as to treat other multiresistant
bacteria including the relevant species of Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, or Enterobacter.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis
of [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– IOH-NPs
Na2(CLP) (25 mg, Aldrich, 95.7%) was
dissolved in water (50 mL). The pH of this solution was adjusted to
7.0 upon the addition of diluted NaOH (140 μL, 0.5 M). Thereafter,
an aqueous solution (5 mL) of ZrOCl2 × 8H2O (4.25 mg, Aldrich, 99%) was injected. After 2 min of intense stirring,
the nanoparticles were separated via centrifugation (25 000 rpm, 15
min). To remove all remaining salts, the colorless [ZrO]2+[CLP]2– was resuspended in and centrifuged from
H2O three times. Subsequent to redispersion, highly stable
colloidal suspension in water can be obtained (Figure 1b).
