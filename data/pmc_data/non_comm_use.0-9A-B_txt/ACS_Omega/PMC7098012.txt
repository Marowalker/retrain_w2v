We
newly designed a functionalized monomer (PhAVE-AcOH) containing
a phenylacetylene (PhA) group and a 1-(acetoxy)ethoxy group, the latter
of which is expected to act as an initiator moiety in combination
with Lewis acid-based activators under living cationic polymerization
conditions. A polyPhA-based multifunctional initiator poly(PhAVE-AcOH)
with a narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn = 1.02) was synthesized by
Rh complex-mediated living coordination polymerization of PhAVE-AcOH.
Then, living cationic graft polymerization of isobutyl vinyl ether
(IBVE) was performed employing the pendant 1-(acetoxy) ethoxy initiating
moiety of poly(PhAVE-AcOH) to form polyIBVE-grafted polyPhA(polyPhA-g-polyIBVE), where both the main chain and side chains possessed
well-controlled structures (Mw/Mn = 1.05–1.10). We found that UV–vis
absorption spectra of polyPhA-g-polyIBVE were progressively
redshifted with increasing molecular weights of the graft chain.

Introduction
The precision synthesis of graft polymers
has been of considerable
interest following the discovery of the living polymerization technique.1−6 Compared to linear polymers, densely grafted polymers having corresponding
molar masses generally show smaller hydrodynamic radii, lower melt
and solution viscosities, lower glass transition temperatures, lower
crystallinities, and higher solubilities that arise from their compact
structures and flexible graft chains.7−12 Synthesis of brush-shaped polymers has been mainly achieved by the
following three methodologies: (1) the “grafting-onto”
method where separately synthesized end-functionalized polymers are
attached onto a multifunctional linear backbone polymer;13−15 (2) the “grafting-from” method involving the graft
polymerization of monomers from a linear macromolecular initiator
having multiple initiating sites;16−18 and (3) the “grafting-through”
method (so-called macromonomer methodology) in which macromonomers
are polymerized to form grafted polymers.19−21 Thus, for the
synthesis of well-defined macromonomers and multi-functionalized macromolecular
initiators, not only the molecular design of multi-functionalized
monomers containing functional groups of different reaction characteristics
but also their selective reactions are important.

Poly(phenylacetylene)s
(polyPhAs) have attracted much attention
because of their interesting physical and physicochemical properties.22−26 Recently, external stimuli-responsive properties of a series of
polyPhA-bearing functionalized side chains have been investigated
experimentally and theoretically.27−29 In addition, it has
already been recognized that the side chain structures of polyPhAs
play important roles not only to enhance their solubility but also
to affect conjugation lengths in the main chain. Thus, the optical
properties of such polyPhA-based materials can be controlled by the
total molecular design of the side chain structure or the graft copolymer
structure. Synthesis of well-defined graft polymers based on the polyPhA
main chain has been studied extensively. Miura and Okada developed
a series of grafted polyPhAs bearing polystyrene branches by living
radical polymerization with a polyPhA-based initiator having multiple
initiating sites via the “grafting-from” methodology.30,31 On the other hand, homo- and copolymerization of PhA-end-capped
macromonomers using Rh-based catalysts via the “grafting-through”
methodology has been well investigated to yield various functionalized
grafted polyPhAs.32−35 Recently, we have reported that PhA-end-capped poly(vinyl ether)
(polyVE)-based macromonomers can produce a brush-shaped polyPhA bearing
polyVE side chains via Rh complex-mediated homopolymerization.36 However, with this methodology, grafted polymers
having a main chain structure with a high degree of polymerization
(DP) were difficult to synthesize due to steric hindrance of the macromonomers
for living coordination homopolymerization (Scheme 1, route A). Here, we propose a synthetic
strategy combining two types of controlled polymerizations to design
well-defined grafted polymers consisting of a polyPhA backbone and
polyVE pendants via the “grafting-from” methodology.
In this study, we first synthesized a PhA derivative (PhAVE-AcOH)
bearing a 1-(acetoxy)ethoxy group, which is an initiating site for
living cationic polymerization. Next, we synthesized a polyPhA-based
multifunctional initiator [poly(PhAVE-AcOH)] by Rh complex-mediated
living coordination polymerization of PhAVE-AcOH. The resulting poly(PhAVE-AcOH)
was then employed as a macromolecular multifunctional initiator in
living cationic polymerization of isobutyl vinyl ether (IBVE) to afford
the target polyPhA having both well-defined main chain and the side
chains structures (Scheme 1; route B). Solutions of the resulting graft polymers showed
intriguing changes in color depending on the side chain lengths, i.e.,
molecular weight of polyIBVE. Our strategy to combine two types of
living polymerization techniques thus will enable the design of a
wide variety of polyPhA-based graft polymers, where the length and
type of pendant polyVEs can be modified concurrently.

Scheme 1 Two Routes
for the Synthesis of Poly(vinyl ether)-Grafted Poly(phenylacetylene)s
by a Combination of Living Coordination Polymerization and Living
Cationic Polymerization
Results
and Discussion
In our previous report,36 we presented
the synthesis of a novel bifunctional compound having both phenylacetylene
and VE moieties, revealed that its trifluoroacetic acid adduct with
1-(trifluoroacetoxy)ethoxy group can act as novel initiators for living
cationic polymerization of VEs, and then succeeded in the controlled
synthesis of a novel PhA-end-capped polyVE macromonomer. Moreover,
we described that the polymerization of the PhA-end-capped polyVE-based
macromonomer using Rh catalysis ([(nbd)RhCl]2 (nbd = 2,5-norbornadiene))
allowed the synthesis of graft copolymers consisting of a polyPhA
main chain and well-defined polyVE side chains. We initially attempted
to synthesize a graft copolymer with well-defined main chain and side
chains using the “grafting-through” strategy by living
coordination polymerization with the Rh catalyst system [1/(Ph-F)3P; 1 = Rh(CPh = CPh2)(nbd)(Ph-F)3P, (Ph-F)3P = tris(4-fluorophenyl)phosphine], which
is an effective catalyst for the living polymerization of PhA derivatives37 in toluene at 25 °C (Scheme 1; route A). However, size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) analysis indicated that the polymerization failed because no
molecular weight increase was observed. The elution peak of the major
compound in the reaction mixture did not shift to a higher-molecular-weight
region as compared to the corresponding macromonomer. The graft copolymer
synthesis was then attempted by the “grafting-from”
methodology, that is, graft polymerization of VEs was carried out
with a macromolecular multifunctional initiator bearing pendant 1-(acetoxy)ethoxy
groups. As shown in Scheme 1 route B, the synthesis of graft copolymer polyPhA-g-polyIBVE was based on a two-step synthetic strategy: (1)
synthesis of the macromolecular initiator [poly(PhAVE-AcOH)] by living
coordination polymerization and (2) synthesis of the graft copolymer
of IBVE with poly(PhAVE-AcOH) by living cationic polymerization. It
should be noted that the combination of the two types of controlled
polymerization techniques allows multiple means to control the structure
of the graft copolymers, where the lengths of the pendant polyIBVEs
and the backbone polyPhA can be concurrently regulated.

Synthesis of
PhAVE-AcOH
Recently, we have focused on
the 1-(trifluoroacetoxy)ethoxy group, which can act as an initiator
for living cationic polymerization of VEs, and succeeded in the synthesis
of various types of end-functionalized polyVEs.36,38−42 However, introduction of the 1-(trifluoroacetoxy)ethoxy group to
polymer side chains as a macromolecular initiator is difficult due
to its moisture sensitivity. To attain an effective macromolecular
initiator, we instead focus on the 1-(acetoxy)ethoxy group, which
can be prepared by the addition of acetic acid and has already been
recognized as an initiator moiety in combination with Lewis acid-based
activators under living cationic polymerization conditions.43,44 As depicted in Scheme 1, PhAVE reacted with 2 equivs of acetic acid at 60 °C for 4
h to give PhAVE-AcOH in 97% yield. The structure of PhAVE-AcOH was
characterized by 1H and 13C NMR. As shown in Figure 1a, 1H
NMR analysis of PhAVE-AcOH showed a series of characteristic resonances,
including those of the phenyl protons (peak c at δ 8.0 and peak
b at δ 7.6 ppm), the 1-(acetoxy)ethoxy group protons (peak f
at δ 6.0, peak h at δ 2.1, and peak g at δ 1.4 ppm),
and the ethynyl protons (peak a at δ 3.2 ppm). The integration
area ratios of a:c:f are 1.00:2.00:1.00, which were in good agreement
with the proton number ratios of the proposed structure.

and (c) polyPhA-g-polyIBVE in CDCl3 (asterisk,
CHCl3; x, remaining solvents).

Polymerization of PhAVE-AcOH with the Rh Catalyst
Polymerization
of PhAVE-AcOH was investigated in toluene at 25 °C for 1.5 h
using a binary Rh catalyst system [1/(Ph-F)3P] ([PhAVE-AcOH]0/[1]0/[(Ph-F)3P]0 = 250/1/5, [PhAVE-AcOH]0 = 50 mmol
L–1). The reaction was quenched with acetic acid
through hydrogenation of the ω-terminal.45 The resulting polymer [poly(PhAVE-AcOH)] was analyzed by
refractive index (RI)-detected SEC in THF. The SEC curve of the obtained
poly(PhAVE-AcOH) shows a unimodal peak with relatively broad molecular
weight distribution (MWD) (Mn = 15,000, Mw/Mn = 1.43, as
estimated using polystyrene standards). However, we found that the
present polymerization proceeded in a controlled manner at 0 °C.
As shown in Figure 2a, the recorded SEC chromatogram of the poly(PhAVE-AcOH) showed a
unimodal and narrow elution peak (Mn =
42,000, Mw/Mn = 1.02). The 1H NMR spectrum of the isolated poly(PhAVE-AcOH)
is depicted in Figure 1b. The signals of phenyl and −CH=C–
protons (peaks c′, b′, and a′) coming from the
polyPhA repeating units appeared at δ 7.6, 6.7, and 5.7 ppm,
respectively. The ratio of the resonance intensities of the methine
proton versus aromatic protons in poly(PhAVE-AcOH) (peaks f′
and c′) was 0.998:2.00, indicating that the pendant 1-(acetoxy)ethoxy
group was intact under the living coordination polymerization conditions.
In addition, a clear signal at δ 5.7 ppm (peak a′) was
assigned to the cis olefinic proton, indicating that the backbone
of polyPhA possessed a cis-transoidal structure. The cis content of
poly(PhAVE-AcOH) was estimated to be 92%. The cis content is nearly
identical to those of the polyPhA derivatives synthesized by using
the same Rh catalyst system [1/(Ph-F)3P].46 All the resonances are relatively broad due
the rigid conformation of the main chain that restricted the motion
of the backbone. These results clearly indicate that the controlled
coordination polymerization of PhAVE-AcOH resulted in the successful
synthesis of a well-defined macromolecular multifunctional initiator
[poly(PhAVE-AcOH)].

Polymerization of IBVE was conducted with poly(PhAVE-AcOH)/EtAlCl2/dioxane in toluene at −35 °C ([IBVE]0 = 1.0 M, [EtAlCl2]0 = 50 mM, [dioxane]0 = 2.0 M, [PhAVE-AcOH*]0 = 20 mM; [PhAVE-AcOH*],
concentration based on repeating units).

Cationic Polymerization of IBVE with Poly(PhAVE-AcOH)
There
have been reports about living cationic polymerization of a
number of vinyl monomers, such as alkyl vinyl ether, isobutylene,
and styrene-type monomers.47 Among them,
the adducts with a 1-(acetoxy)ethoxy group, which are prepared from
acetic acid and alkyl vinyl ethers, can induce living cationic polymerization
of VEs in the presence of an activator, such as ZnCl2 or
EtAlCl2.43,44 In the present paper, pendant
1-(acetoxy)ethoxy groups were employed as initiating sites for cationic
polymerization of IBVE. The cationic polymerization of IBVE was carried
out with poly(PhAVE-AcOH) as a macromolecular multifunctional initiator,
EtAlCl2 as an activator, and dioxane as an added base at
−35 °C in toluene under dry nitrogen for 1–12 h
([PhAVE-AcOH*]0/[IBVE]0/[EtAlCl2]0/[dioxane]0 = 1/100/5/200; [PhAVE-AcOH*], concentration
based on repeating units). The reaction was quenched by using sodiomalonic
ester as an end-capping agent.48 The polymerization
product was obtained as a reddish yellow sticky solid that is soluble
in common organic solvents such as toluene, CHCl3, and
THF. Figure 2b shows
the time–conversion curve obtained for the polymerization of
IBVE, showing that the polymerization proceeded smoothly without an
induction phase then reaching over 90% conversion within 12 h. The
first-order kinetic plot for the polymerizations of IBVE revealed
a linear dependence indicating a constant carbocationic species concentration
indicative of the absence of significant termination reactions (Figure 2c). The resulting
graft copolymer was analyzed in THF using a size exclusion chromatograph
equipped with RI and UV (254 nm) dual detectors. The SEC traces for
the obtained copolymer are shown in Figure 2a; the peak of the macromolecular initiator
completely disappeared after the graft polymerization, and two new
peaks emerged. The ratio of the two polymerization products was ∼8:2,
as determined from their peak areas in the SEC eluogram. The higher-molecular-weight
peaks have much larger molecular weights (Mn = 159,000–356,000) compared to the macromolecular initiator
(Mn = 42,000), and these peaks obtained
with RI and UV detectors were nearly identical, indicating that the
polymers possess a chromophoric polyPhA backbone. On the other hand,
the lower-molecular-weight peaks were detected only by an RI detector,
showing that no chromophoric moieties are included. These peaks were
assignable to free polyIBVE, probably caused by the cationic polymerization
initiated with the adventitious water in the polymerization system.
Focusing on the higher-molecular-weight peaks, the SEC curves exhibited
a unimodal peak and the peak top shifted to higher-molecular-weight
regions as the reaction time increased (Table 1). Figure 2d is the plot of the values of Mn and Mw/Mn of the polymers against monomer conversion in the experiment
shown in Figure 2b.
The Mn values of the obtained copolymers
(the open circles in Figure 2d), which were measured by polystyrene (PSt)-calibrated SEC,
were much smaller than the calculated values (the solid line in Figure 2d), which is due
to the significant difference in the hydrodynamic volume of the polyPhA
with densely grafted polyIBVE pendants with respect to PSt standards.
For isolation of polyPhA-g-polyIBVE, the reaction
mixture was subjected to reprecipitation from toluene into EtOH to
remove the lower-molecular-weight product followed by centrifugation.
The SEC trace of the obtained polymer suggested the successful isolation
of the high-molecular-weight product generated in the cationic polymerization.
The isolated polymers were subjected to SEC–multi-angle laser
light scattering (MALLS) to determine the absolute molecular weight
(Mn,MALLS) of polyPhA-g-polyIBVE. The observed Mn,MALLS values
(the closed circles in Figure 2d) were found to increase in direct proportion to the monomer
conversion and were also in good agreement with the calculated values,
supporting that the side chain lengths of the graft copolymer polyPhA-g-polyIBVE are well controlled by the living cationic polymerization.
The isolated polymer was subjected to 1H NMR analysis (Figure 1c). In addition to
the signals of the aromatic protons in polyPhA at δ 6.5–7.0
and 7.5–8.0 ppm (peaks B and C), the broad aliphatic protons
in the pendant polyIBVE segments were clearly observed at δ
0.9 and 3.0–4.0 ppm. Furthermore, signals assignable to the
polyPhA backbone protons were highly broadened, probably due to decreased
mobility of the aromatic moieties substituted by the polyIBVE chains
and directly attached to the stiff polyPhA backbone.49−51 This result indicates that the pendant 1-(acetoxy)ethoxy groups
on the poly(PhA-AcOH) are active enough to induce living cationic
polymerization of IBVE and useful for the synthesis of graft copolymer
polyPhA-g-polyIBVE via “grafting-from”
methodology. However, a small peak was also observed at δ 5.9
ppm (peak f″), which was attributable to the proton signal
of an 1-(acetoxy)ethoxy group. The graft efficiencies or initiation
efficiencies (fs) for the living cationic polymerization
process were preliminarily estimated through the integration area
ratios of f″:A as 60–67%. Indeed, the initiation of
the graft polymerization was not quantitative, but the residual pendant
1-(acetoxy)ethoxy groups induced no side reactions throughout the
graft polymerization.

Further investigation about the graft copolymers structure can
give useful information for the extent of control in the polyIBVE-based
side chain formation. To this end, direct analysis of the side chains
was performed.52 In the present study,
graft copolymers with well-controlled architecture are defined as
the polymers possessing controlled length of either the backbone or
side chains. Because the graft copolymer has the cleavable ester linkage
between the main chain and side chains, direct analysis of the pendant
polyIBVE can be achieved by cleaving the linkages. We carried out
hydrolysis by refluxing the graft copolymer in the MeOH/THF mixture
in the presence of KOH.53 The polymers
obtained from the cleavage reactions were then characterized by SEC
to examine the growth of the side chains with increasing the monomer
conversion (Figure 3 and Table 2). Following
the hydrolysis reactions, only a single low-molecular-weight polymer
was observed in each experiment, which indicates that the cleavage
reaction was nearly quantitative. Because the polyPhA backbone makes
up a low percentage of the overall mass of the graft copolymer, it
is undetectable after the side chains are removed. MWDs of polyIBVEs
obtained from the graft copolymer were ca. 1.4 or below. This result
again indicates that the graft polymerization of IBVE proceeded in
a controlled manner. Furthermore, we note that the Mns of the cleaved polyIBVE side chains agree with those
of the small peaks observed in the lower-molecular-weight region of
SEC traces of the graft copolymer in Figure 2a. For example, the Mn of the small peak observed for the graft copolymer at 98%
conversion of IBVE (reaction time = 12 h) is 12,000 and that for the
polyIBVE obtained by hydrolysis is also 12,000. On the basis of this
agreement, the peak was also assignable to the polyIBVE-free polymer.
Both the 1H NMR and SEC measurements indicate that the
graft copolymers having controlled molecular weight and narrow molecular
weight distribution with a polyPhA backbone and polyIBVE side chains
were prepared by the combination of living coordination polymerization
and living cationic polymerization.

Optical Properties of PolyPhA-g-polyIBVE
As depicted in Figure 4, we have discovered a very interesting fact
that the UV–vis
absorption maxima of polyPhA-g-polyIBVE were redshifted
depending on the polyIBVE side chain length. The normalized UV–vis
absorption spectrum of poly(PhAVE-AcOH) in dichloromethane at 25 °C
exhibits a peak in the range of 375–550 nm with maximum at
425 nm, while the maxima of polyPhA-g-polyIBVE at
27, 40, 76, and 98% conversion of IBVE were 450, 455, 460, and 470
nm, respectively. This result indicates that the graft copolymer have
longer conjugation lengths in the main chain than poly(PhAVE-AcOH).
It has been reported that the absorption peak of a polyPhA derivative
shifts to a longer wavelength as the steric effect of ring substituents
increases.54 For example, poly[(o-methylphenyl)acetylene] exhibits an absorption at 440
nm,55,56 while poly{[o-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl]-acetylene},
which possesses a bulkier trimethylsilyl substituent, has an absorption
at 520 nm. Grubbs and co-workers have proposed an idea that the steric
requirements of the substituents impose a planar conformation on the
polymer backbone.57 The bulky polyIBVE
side chain of the grafted copolymer should prevent the polyPhA backbone
from bending and twisting and force the main chain to take a more
planar conformation.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated an efficient
and convenient route
to the synthesis of a graft copolymer (polyPhA-g-polyIBVE)
containing a well-defined polyPhA backbone and well-defined polyIBVE
side chains. This achievement was brought about by a successful combination
of living coordination polymerization and living cationic polymerization.
First, living coordination polymerization of PhAVE-AcOH led to the
formation of polyPhA-based macromolecular multifunctional initiators
[poly(PhAVE-AcOH)] with well-defined structures. Next, these macromolecular
initiators are useful for the synthesis of polyPhA-g-polyIBVE via “grafting-from” methodology. Solutions
of the resulting polymers showed intriguing changes in absorption
color depending on the length of side chains. The conjugation lengths
of the polyPhA main chain would be closely related to the pendant
polyIBVE structure; we therefore expect to design various polyVEs-grafted
conjugated polymers that are capable of responding to external stimuli
such as pH, temperature, and addition of metal ions or biomolecules.

Experimental
Section
Instruments
1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker model AC-500 spectrometer
operating at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, where chemical shifts
(δ in ppm) were determined with respect to nondeuterated solvent
residues as internal standards. Analytical size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) was performed at 40 °C using 8.0 mm × 300 mm polystyrene
gel columns (Shodex KF-804 x 2) on a TOSOH model DP-8020 equipped
with a UV-8000 variable-wavelength UV–vis detector and a RI-8022
RI detector. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity ratio (Mw/Mn) were calculated from the chromatographs
with respect to 15 polystyrene standards (Scientific Polymer Products,
Inc.; Mn = 580–670,000 g mol–1, Mw/Mn = 1.01–1.07). SEC–multi-angle laser light
scattering (MALLS) measurements were performed on a TOSOH GPC-8020
system, equipped with a column (Shodex KF-805 L), a Wyatt Technology,
DAWN HELEOS multi-angle laser light scattering photometer with a He–Ne
laser (λ0 = 658 nm), and a Wyatt
Technology Optilab rEX differential refractometer, using CHCl3 as an eluent at a flow rate of 0.40 mL min–1. The SEC–MALLS profiles were recorded and analyzed using
ASTRA software (ver.6.1.1, Wyatt Technology). Differential refractive
index increments (∂n/∂c) for the polymers in CHCl3 were determined based on the peak area of the refractive
index chromatograms and the polymer mass concentration (c) of the injected solutions assuming that all the injected polymers
were fully recovered. UV–vis spectra were recorded using a
quartz cell of 1 cm path length on a SHIMADZU Type UV-2550 spectrometer.

Polymerization of PhAVE-AcOH with Rh Catalyst
(1)
The polymerization using 1/(Ph-F)3P was carried out under the following conditions: [PhAVE-AcOH]0 = 50 mmol L–1, [1]0 = 0.2 mmol L–1, and [(Ph-F)3P]0 = 1.0 mmol L–1. A typical procedure is
as follows: Rh catalyst (1; 2.4 mg, 3.2 μmol) was added to a
toluene solution (16 mL) of PhAVE-AcOH (220 mg, 800 μmol) and
(Ph-F)3P (5.1 mg, 16 μmol) under a dry nitrogen atmosphere.
After being vigorously stirred for 24 h, the polymerization was quenched
with acetic acid (4.5 mL). The reaction mixture was evaporated to
dryness under reduced pressure and poured into a large amount of MeOH
to precipitate the polymers. The resultant polymer was collected by
centrifugation and dried under reduced pressure. Poly(PhAVE-AcOH)
was obtained as red solid (200 mg) in 91% yield. The polymer structure
was analyzed by 1H NMR measurement and analytical SEC in
THF. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.61 (2H), 6.71 (2H), 5.92 (1H), 5.72 (1H), 4.35 (2H), 3.85 (2H),
2.01 (3H), 1.34 (3H).

Cationic Polymerization of IBVE with Poly(PhAVE-AcOH)
The cationic polymerization of IBVE with poly(PhAVE-AcOH) was carried
out under a dry nitrogen atmosphere in baked glass tubes equipped
with a three-way stopcock. A typical example for the polymerization
procedure is as follows: to a toluene solution (2.68 mL) of poly(PhAVE-AcOH)
(11 mg, 0.04 mmol; the value based on repeating units), IBVE (0.52
mL, 4.0 mmol) and dioxane (0.68 mL, 8 mmol) was added EtAlCl2 (in hexane, 1.6 mol L–1; 0.12 mL, 0.20 mmol) at
−35 °C under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. After the reaction
time of 1, 2, 5, and 12 h, each polymerization was quenched with sodiomalonic
ester solution (in toluene/dioxane (1.2/1 v/v), 0.23 mol L–1; 5.0 mL, 1.2 mmol). The conversion of IBVE was determined by 1H NMR analysis. The solution was diluted with toluene, then
washed with brine, evaporated under reduced pressure, and then vacuum-dried
to yield the target polymer (polyPhA-g-polyIBVE). Mn and Mw/Mn of the obtained polymers were determined by
analytical SEC in THF. The toluene solution of the reaction mixture
was poured into a large amount of EtOH to precipitate the polymers
to remove the lower-molecular-weight product. The resultant polymer
was collected by centrifugation and dried under reduced pressure.
The isolated polymer structure was analyzed by 1H NMR measurement.

Hydrolysis of Graft Copolymer
To a solution of graft
copolymer (20 mg) in THF (9 mL) was added a solution of KOH (9 g)
in MeOH (18 mL); the resultant mixture was gently refluxed for 2 h.
After cooling to room temperature, it was neutralized with a diluted
aqueous HCl and the mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure.
The residue was dissolved in toluene, washed with water, and evaporated
under reduced pressure. The resulting polymer was subjected to SEC
analysis.
