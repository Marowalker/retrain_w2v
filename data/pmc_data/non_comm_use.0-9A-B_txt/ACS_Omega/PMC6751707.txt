Polymer dyes have
many potential advantages, such as high molecular
weight, better light capture ability, thermal stability, film-forming
ability, light resistance, and electrochemical corrosion resistance.
They are expected to provide opportunities for the development of
high-stability dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). However, polymer
DSCs (PDSCs) have poor short-circuit current and filling factor (FF)
due to polymer aggregation and chain-winding effect. Therefore, the
energy conversion efficiency is low. In this work, we are trying to
find a way to solve this problem. Herein, three polymers, polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03 with different
π-bridge chains were prepared on a titanium dioxide electrode
using an “adsorption first, then electropolymerization (EP)”
process. Meanwhile, as a comparison, three oligomers, PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03 with the same skeleton
were synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reaction and fabricated on
a titanium dioxide electrode with a “first polymerization,
then adsorption” process. Then, the photoanode adsorbed by
those polymers or oligomers were applied to DSCs. The results show
that polymers prepared by the EP method obtained a higher short-circuit
(Jsc) increase, exceeding 30% and a FF
increase of about 10%, and finally, the photo-to-electric conversion
efficiency (PCE) increased exceeding 40%, compared to the oligomers.
In addition, desorption experiments in a harsh environment show that
the EP method-synthesized polymers (polyPAC-03 as a representative)
have better solvent resistance and adsorption stability than the corresponding
oligomers (PAC-03). The results show that the process
of “adsorption first, then EP” may be an effective way
to solve the bottlenecks of low energy conversion efficiency on PDSCs
and provide a new way to develop stable and efficient DSCs.

1 Introduction
Despite the decline in
research interest, dye-sensitized solar
cells (DSCs)1 have a large potential to
achieve the transformation of solar power to electricity at a low
cost, owing to abundant raw materials and simple manufacturing technologies.2,3 Apart from excellent performance organometallic dyes such as polypyridine
ruthenium complexes4−7 and Zn–porphyrin complexes,8−10 and many latecomer metal-free
sensitizers,11−17 a few endeavors have been devoted to D−π–A-type
conjugated organic polymer dyes18−25 to seek devices with high stability and long cycle life. In these
polymer dyes, donors are polymerized to form the main chain, and the
π-bridge and acceptor are designed as a pendent side chain.
For example, Liu and co-workers synthesized a conjugate polymer dye
(P2) containing an electron-donating backbone (triphenylamine)
and an electron-accepting side chain (cyanoacetic acid) with conjugated
thiophene units as the linkers and resulting in a power conversion
efficiency of 3.39%.18 Baek and co-workers
reported a conjugated polymer (RCP-1) composed of a carbazole as the
electron donor and a side-chain cyanoacetic acid as the electron acceptor
connected through conjugated vinylene and terthiophene. When tested
as a photosensitizer in DSCs, the well-defined D−π–A
structure of RCP-1 obtained the power conversion efficiency over 4%
and with good operation stability.21 Our
group reported three conjugated polymers with main-chain donors, and
pendent acceptors were utilized as sensitizers in which thiophene
was selected as the conjugated unit. Such polymer dyes obtained a
best efficiency up to 4.4% when applied in DSCs as sensitizers.25 Actually, as a candidate for high stability
DSCs, the application of D−π–A-type conjugated
polymers as dyes utilized in DSCs have been seldom paid attention
to because of their relatively low short current and fill factor.

Nevertheless, in comparison to small molecules, conjugated polymers
have many potential advantages because of their high molecular weight
and long-chain properties. First, polymers have higher molar extinction
coefficients as compared to small molecules, which could increase
the light capture ability of devices. Then, polymer dyes have better
thermal stability, light resistance, and electrochemical corrosion
resistance, which could improve the adsorption stability of dyes on
titanium dioxide films and greatly increase the cell cycling life.
Third, a polymer has film-forming property, and the barrier effect
of the polymer film may better inhibit the interface charge recombination
between titanium dioxide and liquid electrolyte. Therefore, in recent
years, some studies have focused on the development of polymer DSCs
(PDSCs). However, the performance of these devices was very disappointing.
The main reason was that the short-circuit (Jsc) and filling factor (FF) of PDSCs were relatively low. And
even, Schanze et al. found that the photo-to-electric conversion efficiency
(PCE) of PDSCs decreases with the increase of polymer molecular weight.23 Recently, we investigated the previous work
on PDSCs and a mass of literature research on conjugated polymers
applied in other fields18−23,26−28 and found that
it may be the intermolecular entanglement and aggregation caused by
the twisting of long molecular chains on the interface of titanium
dioxide that led to the low energy-conversion efficiency of PDSCs,
resulting in the low adsorption efficiency of polymer dyes, which
greatly affected the efficiency of electron injection, making it hard
to obtain high Jsc and FF.

Therefore,
in this work, we selected some simple, commonly used,
and inexpensive organic fragments, such as carbazole as the active
group for electropolymerization (EP), triphenylamine as a donor, thiophene–EDOT
as a π-bridge unit, and cyanoacetic acid as the receptor. Before polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03 were synthesized on the titanium dioxide electrode by “adsorption
first, then EP” process and characterized by infrared spectroscopy;
three oligomers (PDI = 2–4), PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03 (shown in Figure 1), as well as three monomers, M1, M2, and M3 having the same trunk prepared
for EP were constructed by common organic synthesis reactions. For
comparison, before the polymers on the titanium dioxide electrode
were fabricated into a cell, the photophysical and electrochemical
properties of the three oligomers were tested, and the photovoltaic
devices were fabricated by using these oligomers as photosensitizers
via the traditional process. Preliminary tests show that polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03 have higher Jsc and FF than the corresponding oligomers.
Among them, polyPAC-03 with EDOT–thiophene as
the π-bridging unit obtained a Voc of 0.75 V, Jsc of 12.73 mA cm–2, and a FF of 0.69, finally, obtaining the highest PCE of 6.60%,
which was 64% higher than the corresponding oligomer PAC-03 (Voc = 0.71 V, Jsc = 9.54 mA cm–2, FF = 0.59, PCE = 4.01%).
The electronic lifetime calculated by electrochemical impedance fitting
showed that although the electronic lifetime on the photoanode of
the polymers were higher than that of the corresponding oligomers,
resulting in a slight increase in the corresponding Voc, it was not the key factor for improvement of the photovoltaic
performance of PDSCs. Finally, we selected a representative polymer
(polyPAC-03) and oligomer (PAC-03) to carry
out desorption experiments under harsh conditions. The results showed
that polyPAC-03 exhibited better adsorption stability
than PAC-03, on which we speculated that the polymer
sensitizers prepared by the process of “first adsorption, then
EP” had higher adsorption efficiency than the process of “first
polymerization, then adsorption”, and the EP technology can
make the polymer assembled on the titanium dioxide electrode to form
a photoactive layer with a high crosslinking degree, which can effectively
improve the adsorption stability and photovoltaic performance of the
PDSCs.

2.1.2 Electrochemical Polymerization-Fabricated
Poly-(triphenylamine-carbazolyl) Framework
A CHI660C electrochemical
workstation was used for EP in CN containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium
hexaflourophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte with a
three-electrode system in which a cycloidal TiO2 electrode
(∼0.28 cm2, stained by immersing it into 200 μg/L
solution of M1, M2, and M3 in
THF: AN, v/v, 1/10 for 12 h) was used as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl
(sat. KCl) was used as the reference electrode, and Pt as the counter
electrode. Considering the nonconductivity of titanium dioxide, the
whole cell was irradiated by simulated sunlight over the AM1.5G spectrum
during the EP process;37,38 corresponding sketch maps are
illustrated in Figure 2A. The reaction was terminated when the current did not decrease
and cyclic voltammetric curves were coincident. The EP-fabricated
photoanode was obtained after the working electrode was washed with
CN and ethanol and dried by nitrogen gas flow, respectively.

Figure 2 (A) Fabrication
process of polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03 used EP method, (B) infrared spectrum
of monomer M3 and polyPAC-03 on TiO2, and (C) CV curve of the synthesis of polyPAC-03 with a three-electrode system in CN.

Figure 2C shows
the CV curve on the electrochemical polymerization reaction from M3 to dye polyPAC-03, in which the maximum peak
current at the outermost part is the curve of the initial reaction.
Correspondingly, the curve with the minimum peak current at the innermost
part was the curve of the end of the reaction. It can be seen that
with the progress of the polymerization, the decreasing speed of the
peak current decreases correspondingly, and the peak oxidation potential
increases gradually, indicating that more and more active sites of
carbazole participate in the polymerization. Figure 2B shows the infrared spectra of monomer M3/TiO2 and polyPAC-03/TiO2 scraped off from the photoanode. It can be seen that both M3/TiO2 and polyPAC-03/TiO2 have strong O–H stretching vibration peaks around 3500 cm–1, which was due to the presence of a large number
of hydroxyl groups on the surface of TiO2. For monomer M3/TiO2, the absorption peaks at 2950–3050
cm–1 were strong C–H stretching vibration
peaks, the absorption peaks at 1420–1300 cm–1 were attributed to the C–H in-plane bending vibration peaks
on triphenylamine and carbazole-structured benzene rings, and the
absorption peaks at 1000–670 cm–1 were attributed
to the C–H out-of-plane bending vibration peaks on triphenylamine
and carbazole. However, the C–H stretching vibration peaks,
in-plane bending vibration peaks, and out-of-plane bending vibration
peaks of triphenylaniline and carbazole-structured benzene rings on polyPAC-03/TiO2 were much weaker than those of M3/TiO2. This indicated that most C–H on
carbazole of M3 disappear and become a dimer or polymer.
The cyclic voltammetric curves and infrared spectra of EP process
of M1 and M2 were very similar to those
of M3, so there was no illustration here.

2.2 Photophysical and Electrochemical Properties
Only the
oligomers PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03 at molecular levels were tested as a comparison by
recording the UV–visible absorption spectra and fluorescence
spectra in THF with a mass concentration of 20 μg/L because polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03 obtained by EP were tightly adsorbed on opaque nanocrystalline TiO2 and have the same structural units as PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03; therefore, the ultraviolet–visible
and fluorescence spectra of these polymers have not been measured
here. As shown in Figure 3A note that all oligomers showed absorption bands in the region
of 300–600 nm with two distinct absorption peaks. Peaks at
∼350 nm were attributed to the π–π* transitions
of their conjugated polymer backbones, whereas peaks at 450–500
nm were correspondent to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)
interactions between their polymeric main chains and pendent acceptor
groups. The two-band absorption was typical of D−π–A-type
conjugated molecules.

Figure 3 (A) UV–vis absorption of the oligomers measured
on a Shimadzu
UV2600 spectrometer and (B) fluorescence spectra of oligomers recorded
with a PerkinElmer LS55 luminescence spectrometer in THF.

The detailed parameters are listed in Table 1, the extinction coefficient (ε) at
the absorption maximum for PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03 were 1.78 × 104, 3.20 ×
104, and 2.62 × 104 cm–1 M–1, respectively, which were concentrated on
the π–π* transitions peaks, indicating a weak ICT
force of the three materials. This may be due to the large dihedral
angle (the dihedral angle between triphenylamine and carbazolyl were
equal to about 90°, Figure 5C) between the backbone and branched π-bridge–acceptor
of the oligomers, and it may also be a weak chromophore on the π-bridge.
We also noted that the ICT peak was red-shifted in PAC-03 as compared to that in PAC-01 and PAC-02, which was because the introduction of thiophene–EDOT unit
broadened the absorption spectra, and the extinction coefficient of PAC-02 in the ICT peak was higher than PAC-01; this could be attributed to the utilization of the stronger chromophore
EDOT compared to the thiophene unit. The ameliorative absorption spectra
compared to PAC-01 indicate that it was a feasible scheme
to use tunable π-bridges in sensitizers.

Oligomers PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03 exhibited fluorescence in
the visible region with excitation wavelength
of maximum absorption wavelength in the ICT peaks of UV–vis
spectra; the fluorescence spectra was collected in Figure 3B, and the maximum fluorescence
emission values are listed in Table 1. All three oligomers exhibited relatively weak fluorescence
intensity at three orders of magnitude, which was due to the weaker
ICT peaks as compared to π–π* transitions peaks.
The three oligomers feature the maximum emission wavelength at 624,
586, and 646 nm with Stokes shift of ca. 166, 140, and 150 nm (<1
eV), respectively. The low emission intensity and Stokes shift indicate
a comparatively weak intrachain charge-transfer character in the singlet
excited state and low energy loss upon photoexcitation.

To fabricate
an efficient DSC, the favorite energy-offsets of sensitizers
with respect to the TiO2 nanocrystals and redox electrolytes
were the priority among priorities. The E0–0 (optical band gaps) were estimated from the intersection points
of normalized absorption and emission spectra of 20 μg/L dye
solution (THF), as shown in Figure 4A, being 2.33, 2.44, and 2.15 eV for PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03, respectively. Then,
the ground-state redox potentials were measured in THF via cyclic
voltammetry, as shown in Figure 4B, which can be accurately derived by finding the initial
oxidation potential. The onset oxidation potentials (Eoxonset) for PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03 were
0.34, 0.16, and 0.24 V versus Fc/Fc+ (0.46 V), respectively;
the detailed data were listed in Table 1.

(sat. KCl) calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as an internal reference; counter electrode, Pt.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels
of
the materials were estimated according to the following equation30  

Calculated from this empirical
formula, the HOMO levels of PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03 were
−5.14, −4.96, and −5.04 eV, respectively. As
most organic photoresponse dyes, the onset reduction potentials of
the three oligomers were not observed in the CV curves, so the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were estimated via
the optical band gaps (E0–0) and
HOMO levels based on the relation, E0–0 = ELUMO – EHOMO. Calculated by this method, the LUMO energy level of PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03 were
−2.81, −2.52, and −2.89 eV, respectively. It
should be noted that the LUMO levels were well above the conduction
band level of TiO2 (−4.0 eV), exceeding 1 eV. Therefore,
electron injections from the single excited state (LUMO) of the three
polymer dyes into the conduction band of TiO2 were abstractly
feasible, but according to the band bending theory, as related to
the LUMO of TiO2, the LUMO of the dye was not the higher
the better, hence, it was indicated that the short current will not
be high. In addition, their HOMO levels were sufficiently more positive
than the redox potential of the iodine/iodide (I–/I3–) couple. Therefore, the photo-oxidized
polymer dyes could be efficiently reduced by iodide ions. It should
be noted that reduction peak of polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03 were also undetected here for they
have the same structural units as PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03.

2.3 Photovoltaic Performance
of DSCs
A screen-printed double layer film of interconnected
TiO2 particles was used as the cathode, on which a 7 μm
thick transparent
layer of 20 nm-sized titania particles were first printed on the fluorine-doped
SnO2 (FTO)-conducting glass electrode and further coated
by a 5 μm-thick scattering layer of 400 nm-sized titania particles.
After activation at 500 °C on a hot air gun, a cycloidal TiO2 electrode (∼0.28 cm2) was stained by immersing
it into the oligomer (PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03) solution (200 μg/L) in THF/AN (v/v, 1/2) for
12 h. After being washed with AN and dried by air flow, the photoanode
of the oligomers-based DSCs was obtained. Meanwhile, the cathode was
immersed into the monomer (M1, M2, and M3) solution (200 μg/L) in THF/AN (v/v, 1/10) for 12
h, then washed with AN and dried by air flow, and put into an electrolyzer
for the EP process, to obtain the photoanode of the PDSCs. The follow-up
packaging processes referred to our previous publications,25 using the infiltrated electrolyte was composed
of 1.0 M DMII, 0.02 M iodine (I2), TBP, 0.1 M GNCS, and
0.05 M LiI in AN purchased from Commercial Company.

The incident
photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the PAC-01, PAC-02, PAC-03, polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03 were
displayed in Figure 5A. After preliminary testing, found
that the IPCE curves of the oligomers were basically agreement
with their absorption spectra. Affording a performance of
IPCE in 300–650 nm regions and exhibiting a  efficiency
up to about 50–57%, with a short-current (JscIPCE) of
8.98, 8.60, and 9.71 mA cm–2 for PAC-01, PAC-02
and PAC-03, respectively. Compared to PAC-01 and PAC-02, it was noted that the PAC-03-based device
exhibited a higher IPCE spectrum response in the range of 300–650
nm, indicating a higher Jsc of PAC-03. The reason for this trend can be explained by the higher molar
extinction coefficient at the ICT-induced absorption peaks and more
electron injection dynamics for introducing both thiophene and EDOT
unit into the π-bridge of PAC-03. When compared
to PAC-01, we can find that there were few improvements
of the IPCE response spectra of PAC-02, except a slightly blue-shifted
response band-edge of PAC-02 when alternative thiophene unit
to EDOT. The results confirmed that it was indeed an effective method
to improve the photovoltaic performance of sensitizers which have
been reported in many other literature.31−33 As for the electrochemically
synthesized polymers, surprisingly, although the IPCE response ranges
(300–650 nm) were very similar to those of the three oligomers
(because they have the same structural units), the extrema of IPCE
have been greatly improved from 50–57 to 75–82%, and
a JscIPCE obtained of 11.55, 10.89, and 12.81 mA cm–2, respectively. The results will be directly reflected in the short-circuit
current of the device below. The current density–voltage of
DSCs based on oligomers and EP-fabricated polymers were monitored
under standard AM 1.5G illumination and the curves are given in Figure 5B, and the detailed
data are collected in Table 2. Note that the oligomer PAC-03 based device
obtained a higher PCE of 4.01%, corresponding to a Jsc of 9.54 mA cm–2, Voc of 0.71 V, and FF of 0.59 compared to the former two
oligomers, with PCE of 3.67%, Jsc of 8.84
mA cm–2, Voc of 0.67
V, and FF of 0.62 for PAC-01, and PCE of 3.64%, Jsc of 8.51 mA cm–2, Voc of 0.70 V, and FF of 0.61 for PAC-02. The Voc of the polymers polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03 prepared by
the process of “first adsorption, then EP” were slightly
higher than those of the oligomers, which were 0.74, 0.75, and 0.75
V, respectively. However, they obtained a significant improvement
of Jsc, of 11.40, 10.96, and 12.73 mA
cm–2, which is in good agreement with the preceding
IPCE measurements, as well as a desired improvement of FF of 0.70,
0.70, and 0.69 for polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03, respectively. As a result, these improvements
have greatly enhanced the PCE to 5.90, 5.75, and 6.60% for the polymers polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03 obtained by the EP technology, respectively.

In fact, the potential advantages of polymers, such
as stronger
light capture ability, good thermal stability, light resistance, electrochemical
corrosion resistance, and film formation, were needed for the development
of stable and efficient DSCs. However, their large dihedral angle
of the main chain, aggregation, and intertwined molecular chains leads
to low adsorption efficiency, which greatly reduced the FF and short-circuit
current of devices. For oligomers, PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03, as shown in Figure 5C, the dihedral angle of units TPA and CZ
in the main chain was close to 90°, so that the adjacent two
anchoring groups have a nearly 90° dihedral angle. Therefore,
we speculated that such a structure will greatly affect the polymer
dye’s adsorption efficiency, thus reducing the FF and short-circuit
current of the device. Moreover, this phenomenon will be aggravated
with the extension of polymer molecular chains. Under these circumstances,
the problem may be solved by the process of “adsorption first,
then polymerization”. As shown in Figure 5D, first, the monomers M1, M2, and M3 with electrochemical active sites
were adsorbed onto the titanium dioxide electrode by solution processing.
Then, the electrodes were used as working electrodes to conduct electrochemical
polymerization under light conditions, expecting that the polymer
dyes with stable adsorption and ordered assembly will be prepared
on the titanium dioxide electrode. Encouragingly, the process achieved
the desired result. The short-circuit current of polymer polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03 was nearly
30% higher than that of the corresponding oligomers, and the FF was
also increased by more than 10%. Finally, the energy conversion efficiency
was increased by nearly 40%. Although the above results were gratifying,
there were still many problems to be solved, such as how to improve
the polymerization degree. In this work, we found that when the cyclic
voltammetric curve of EP scanned about 20 cycles (Figure 2C), the peak current did not
change and the curves begin to coincide, indicating the end of EP.

2.4 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Studies
To further understand the relationship between the charge transfer
process and photovoltaic properties of the PDSCs, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy was carried out in the dark. The Nyquist plots
for the PDSCs based on oligomers PAC-01, PAC-02, PAC-03, and EP polymers polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03 are displayed in Figure 6. The first semicircle
(Rce) obtained in the low-frequency region
was attributed to charge transfer at the counter electrolyte interfaces
by using the same counter electrode and electrolyte,25 the similar Rce values of which
were 22.7, 34.2, and 49.5 Ω cm–2 for PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03, and
52.6, 52.0, and 52.2 Ω cm–2 for polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03 by using the
same counter electrode and electrolyte, respectively. The second semicircle
(Rrec) in the high-frequency region was
accorded to charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte
interface34 with Rrec values of 78.6, 81.2, and 91.8 Ω cm–2 for PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03 and 100.5, 102.1, and 102.8 Ω cm–2 for polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03, respectively. As it was known to us, a larger Rrec indicated a slower charge recombination and a larger
dark current,35 hence, the relatively high Rrec observed in the EP polymers-based devices
indicates a stronger suppression of the recombination of the injected
electron with I–/I3– in the electrolyte, as compared to the oligomers.

Figure 6 Nyquist plots for DSCs
based on the oligomers and EP polymers in
the dark.

To understand charge recombination
more intuitively, the electron
lifetimes were calculated by fitting the equation τr = Rrec × CPE2 (CPE2, chemical capacitance),36 as shown in Table 3; the τr for the oligomers PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03 were
60.2, 71.4, and 82.8 ms and 107.1, 109.3, and 110.2 ms for polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03, respectively.
It should be noted that τr values for the EP polymers
were higher than those for the oligomers, indicating that the process
“first adsorption, then EP” may slow down charge recombination
and contribute to the larger Voc.

2.5 Adsorption Stability Studies
In order
to verify the adsorption stability of a polymer and the corresponding
oligomer, we chose the representative electrochemically synthesized
polymer, polyPAC-03 and the corresponding oligomer, PAC-03 (PDI ≈ 2.80, can be seen as a small molecule
with two or three anchoring groups) as the experimental objects, and
desorption experiments were carried out in different solvents, most
of which were good solvents for the dye. As shown in Figure 7, it can be seen that both polyPAC-03 and PAC-03 can maintain good adsorption
stability after 6 hours immersion in AN solution, whereas in THF,
H2O/THF, KOH/H2O/THF, HCl/H2O/THF,
and HAc/H2O/THF, almost all of the small molecular PAC-03 was desorbed; however, compared with the oligomer, polyPAC-03 still retained some of them and showed better solvent
resistance.

Figure 7 Desorption experiments of oligomer PAC-03 and electrochemically
synthesized polymer polyPAC-03-based photoanode in different
solvents (0: none, 1: CH3CN, 2: THF, 3: H2O/THF
= 1/1 (v/v), 4: KOH (aq, 0.1 M)/THF = 1/1 (v/v), 5: HCl (aq, 0.1 M)/THF
= 1/1 (v/v), 6: HAc/H2O/THF = 1/1/1 (v/v/v) solution immersed
for 6 h at room temperature).

It should be pointed out that neither PAC-03 nor polyPAC-03 can maintain good adsorption stability in acidic
solution. Especially in strong acidic solution (HCl, 0.1 M), both
the oligomer and polymer were desorbed completely. This may be due
to the accelerated hydrolysis of Ti-O bond in the presence of strong
acid environment. In addition, we found that polyPAC-03 could maintain relatively good adsorption stability in good solvents
[e.g., THF, H2O/THF, KOH (aq, 0.1 M)/THF], but most of
them still desorbed. The reason may be that the crosslinking degree
of polyPAC-03 on the titanium dioxide electrode was still
insufficient and the film-forming property was poor. To improve this
problem, in future work, we may be able to increase the amount of
dye adsorption or extend the arm length of the electrochemical active
group (carbazole).

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have presented a series of conjugated oligomers
(PAC-01, PAC-02, and PAC-03) and EP method prepared polymers (polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03) which have the same
conjugate skeleton; the corresponding organic intermediates, monomers,
and oligomers were characterized by 1H NMR and ESI-MS.
Then, we briefly investigated the influence of different π-bridges
in the side chain on photophysical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic
characteristics. Most importantly, we studied the photovoltaic performance
on both the oligomer-based devices prepared by the traditional “first
polymerization, then adsorption” process and the polymer devices
prepared by the “first adsorption, then EP” process.
The results showed that polymer dyes (polyPAC-01, polyPAC-02, and polyPAC-03) prepared by the EP
technology obtained the desired increased Jsc and FF values, and finally obtained an increased PCE of about 40%
higher than those of oligomers. In addition, the desorption experiments
in harsh environment showed that the EP method-prepared polymer dyes
had better solvent resistance and adsorption stability than the oligomers.
The result was consistent with our previous analysis and speculation.
It shows that the orderly assembly and stable adsorption of polymer
photoanodes prepared by the EP process may be an effective way to
prepare PDSCs with high stability and efficiency.
