This
paper describes a method for the quantitative analysis of
mixtures of glycine and its oligomers by ion-pair high-performance
liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC), with a particular focus on applications
in origins-of-life research. We demonstrate the identification of
glycine oligomers (Glyn) up to 14 residues
long—the approximate detectable limit of their solubility in
water—and measurement of the concentration of these species
in the product mixture of an oligomerization reaction. The molar response
factors for higher oligomers of glycine—which are impractical
to obtain as pure samples—are extrapolated from direct analysis
of pure standards of n = 3–6, which established
a clear linear trend. We compare and contrast our method to those
in previous reports with respect to accuracy and practicality. While
the data reported here are specific to the analysis of oligomers of
glycine, the approach should be applicable to the design of methods
for the analysis of oligomerization of other amino acids.

Introduction
The investigation of
systems for the efficient synthesis of polypeptides
in prebiotically relevant conditions is a major focus of origins-of-life
research. Enlivened by Miller’s seminal experiment showing
the synthesis of amino acids from a simulated Hadean atmosphere, researchers
have studied the condensation of amino acids to form peptides in a
variety of prospective prebiotic conditions.1−3 Most proposed
prebiotic syntheses of oligopeptides from amino acids can be classified
into one or more of the following approaches: (i) catalysis by salts
or surfaces at low water activity,4−22 (ii) coupling mediated by stoichiometric reagents,23−27 (iii) strand elongation via acyl-transfer reactions,28−31 (iv) dry-downs and thermal/environmental cycling,10,28,32−34 and (v) reactions driven
by high-energy sources, like UV light or simulated asteroid impacts
(see Figure 1).35−39 Glycine is the most popular substrate for these studies because
of its presumed prebiotic abundance and its simplicity—it lacks
a side chain and is achiral; thus, no branched isomers or stereoisomers
will form as products.40,41

Figure 1 Prebiotically feasible methods for the
condensation of amino acids
into peptides. Five general approaches to the synthesis of oligopeptides
include the use of catalytic salts or surfaces in the dry state, the
use of stoichiometric coupling agents, elongation by acyl-transfer
reactions, condensation through dry-downs or wet–dry environmental
cycling, and reactions driven by sources of high energy, like UV light
or shock impacts.

Justification
Despite the popularity of amino-acid
polymerizations—particularly of glycine—there is no
standard approach to the analysis of their product mixtures. Often,
the various methods employed are described in minimal experimental
detail, and their underlying assumptions are overlooked. In this paper,
we contrast the performance and limitations of our method versus those
previously reported, with the goal of allowing future investigators
to make informed decisions about how to analyze mixtures of oligopeptides
and report yields in a manner that allows the meaningful comparison
of results across the field.

Background
Prebiotic synthesis focuses
on the conversion
of simple feedstocks available on the early Earth into more complex,
functional molecules and systems. For the condensation of amino acids,
it is generally assumed to be advantageous to generate longer oligomers
in higher yields with higher conversion of monomer into products.
The motivating ideas are that (i) higher yields and conversions correspond
to more efficient processes and (ii) longer peptides will have a greater
chance of exhibiting the functional properties of proteins observed
in biochemistry. The specific preference of a synthesis for one product
over others may also be advantageous, though arguments can be made
for the value of variety in polydisperse mixtures. Cyclic dipeptides
(2,5-diketopiperazines, or DKPs) are generally regarded as undesirable
“dead-ends” in these syntheses, as their lack of free
amino and carboxyl groups limits their reactivity and, for many polymerizations,
essentially removes amino acids from the reactive pool of building
blocks.42−44 An important aspect of evaluating and comparing proposed
prebiotic syntheses of polypeptides is the characterization of the
product mixtures. The general methods most commonly reported for these
analyses are NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), and chromatography.

NMR spectroscopy can be used qualitatively to monitor the formation
of amide bonds during amino-acid condensations.34,45 We and others have used NMR spectroscopy quantitatively for applications
like analyzing the hydrolysis of dipeptides of glycine and alanine,46 but the technique becomes increasingly unsuitable
for longer oligomers. Even the relatively short and simple oligomers
Gly1–6 have overlapping signals that prevent accurate
quantitative analysis of their mixtures (see Figure S17 in the Supporting Information).

Various MS techniques
have been used to characterize the products
of oligomerization reactions. MS methods are generally regarded as
qualitative means of establishing the presence of various oligomers;
the intensities of peaks are unreliable for measuring molecular concentrations,
as peak intensities will also depend on each molecule’s propensity
to ionize and fragment. Parker et al. used ultraperformance liquid
chromatography paired with quadrupole-traveling wave ion-mobility
spectrometry and time-of-flight MS (UPLC-Q-TWIMS-TOF-MS) to analyze
the dipeptides produced in Miller–Urey experiments.47 Rodriguez-Garcia et al. used matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS to identify
the presence of oligomers up to Gly20.34 Forsythe et al. recently used liquid chromatography–ion-mobility
spectrometry–tandem MS (LC–IM–MS/MS) to identify
mixed oligomers of Gly, Ala, Leu, and glycolic acid up to n = 8.48 Advances are being made
in improving MS methods to provide reliable quantitative data,49 but ionization and fragmentation are not the
only barriers to the application of MS to the analysis of oligopeptides.
Many prebiotic syntheses employ dry-down conditions with relatively
high concentrations of salts as simulations of evaporating pools of
“prebiotic soups”.21,41,50,51 The charged/zwitterionic
nature of amino acids and peptides makes them difficult to separate
from other ions (i.e., to de-salt them), and high salt is known to
adversely affect a number of MS methods—limiting spectral quality,
reducing quantitative accuracy, and potentially damaging the detector
components of spectrometers.52

Chromatographic
methods—sometimes used in conjunction with
MS—have been the most common methods for the analysis of mixtures
of peptide oligomers. Sugahara and Mimura as well as Fujimoto et al.
used gas chromatography–MS (GC–MS) for the analysis
of product mixtures from pressure-induced oligomerization of Ala.35,36 The analytes were derivatized with isopropanol and trifluoroacetic
anhydride to produce N-trifluoroacetic acylated-(Ala)n-O-isopropyl esters. Only
small oligomers of Alan were formed, and
the authors note that this method is limited to Alan oligomers of n ≤ 3, possibly because
longer oligomers are insufficiently volatile for the analysis by GC.

Derivatization involves the functionalization of analytes with
moieties that aid their detection. These procedures operate on the
assumption that the oligomers present will react with the detection
label with quantitative yield and that each tagged oligomer will have
the same molar absorptivity (unless individual standards are tagged
and analyzed as well). In-line tagging methods require LC systems
with greater sophistication than may be accessible to some groups.
Kitadai and co-workers used the method of Torres et al. for the quantitative
analysis of oligomers of Glyn up to n = 6 using HPLC on a cation-exchange column with post-column
derivatization by o-phthalaldehyde and fluorescence
detection.4−6,53 Fuchida and co-workers
used the same method for the analysis of their product mixtures with
oligomers up to Gly3.19

Ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC) has proven
in many studies to be an effective method for the separation of various
oligomers of glycine.7,11−14,16,20,21,34,38,39 In most of these studies, the Glyn product
mixtures were limited to n ≤ 6; thus, analytical
standards were commercially available. Ohara et al. employed the method
of Rode and co-workers21,54 in using HPLC with hexanesulfonate
as an ion-pair reagent to measure oligomers up to Gly6 by
UV detection and then used LC with a perfluorinated surfactant to
observe Gly7–10 with detection by MS.39

Dalai et al. produced oligomers up to
Gly6 in their
condensations and used IP-HPLC for the primary analysis of the products.13 To quantify the short oligomers of Glyn (n ≤ 3), they compared the
UV response of the products to analytical standards. For the longer
oligomers (n ≥ 4), the authors derivatized
the oligomers with 2,4-dinitrophenyl groups using Sanger’s
reagent and analyzed the products by reverse-phase HPLC.

Rodriguez-Garcia
et al. extended an IP-HPLC method reported by
Rode and co-workers to quantify total combined yields of oligomers
up to Gly14.21,34 They calculated the
total yield of an oligomerization reaction as the proportion of Gly
converted into Gly≥2 (excluding DKP) based on “the
mean absorbance per glycine unit in the larger standards, which was
observed to become approximately constant >3-mer”.

Yu et al. used hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography for
the quantification of depsipeptides and short oligomers of glycine.55 They analyzed standards of Glyn where n = 1–3 and hydroxyacid-N-capped oligomers of glycine and operated under the assumption
that the trend in extinction coefficients extends to higher oligomers.

Results
Measurement/Extrapolation of Molar Response Factors (fn) for Each Glyn
To determine whether there was a relationship
between oligomer length and molar UV response (fn) that could be used to extrapolate values
of fn for higher oligomers,
we obtained commercial samples of Gly1–6 and a custom
order of Gly8. We also ordered Gly10, but the
vendor was unable to synthesize a pure sample. IP-HPLC analysis of
the Gly1–6 samples showed them to be free of detectable
impurities, whereas the Gly8 sample had detectable quantities
of other Glyn oligomers (see Figure S1). As such, we relied on samples of
Gly1–6—and not Gly8—in
our extrapolation of molar response factors for higher oligomers.

The IP-HPLC chromatograms plot absorbance (in units of mV, from detector
signal) versus retention time as analytes elute from the column. We
measured the UV response (An, peak area) for each Glyn standard
at varying concentrations to calculate the molar response factors
(fn) of each oligomer
(Figure 2). Equation 1 relates the UV response
to the number of moles of standard (mn) injected per analyte 1  

Figure 2 (A) Overlaid chromatograms of standard
solutions of Gly4 of varying concentrations, with injections
of 5 μL and detection
at 195 nm. (B) Plot of the UV response vs the number of molecules
of Gly4 injected. The slope of the line equals the molar
response factor (fn)
for Gly4, in accordance with eq 1. Each point represents the mean average of
three standard samples of the corresponding concentration, and the
errors bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

We plotted the values of fn versus oligomer length for the Gly1–6 standards
and generated least-squares regression lines through the first three
points, last four points, and all six points (Figure 3). All three lines had similar slopes and
intercepts, which surprised us for the shortest oligomers, which we
hypothesized could have very different absorbances. Of these three
curves, the line fit to the Gly3–6 data most accurately
models the measured values of the longest standards within the experimental
error of the measurements (Figure 3, Table 1).

glycine (Glyn, n = 1–6),
with least-squares linear regression curves plotted through n = 1–6 (red), n = 1–3 (blue),
and n = 3–6 (green). The error bars represent
95% CIs for the response factors, based on three measurements obtained
independently from the slopes of linear calibration curves constructed
for each oligomer, as for Gly4 in Figure 2B. Note the small differences in the least-squares
linear regression curves; the green curve (n = 3–6)
most accurately predicts the measured values of the longest oligomers
within the experimental error of the measurements, and as such, it
was used to extrapolate the values of fn for Gly>7 employed to determine yields
in subsequent experiments (Table 1).

a Values measured from commercial
standards appear in the second column, while values calculated from
the three linear regression curves shown in Figure 3 appear in the rightmost columns. The bolded
values of fn are those
used in our determination of yields of oligomers in Glyn syntheses.

From this regression curve for Gly3–6, we extrapolated
the molar response factor (fn) values for Gly7–14 (Table 1). With these values in hand, eq 1 is used to determine the concentration
of each Glyn oligomer in a mixture separated
by IP-HPLC. We validated the method by using it to verify the concentration
of oligomers in a mixed standard to demonstrate that the oligomers
did not interfere with each other’s measurement (see Figure
S10 in the Supporting Information). We
also measured a molar response factor for Gly8 from the
impure commercial sample by correcting f8 to account for the measurable Gly6, Gly7,
and Gly9 impurities in the sample (details in the Supplemental
Experimental section of the Supporting Information). This corrected value for f8 was simply
used as a “check standard” for the extrapolation model
described above and was not used to extrapolate higher values of fn.

Characterization of Prebiotic
Oligomerizations
As a
final demonstration of the utility of the method, we applied it to
the analysis of an actual condensation reaction that produced a mixture
of oligoglycines under conditions reported by Cronin and co-workers.34 We prepared three identical 4.0 mL aqueous solutions
of 87.5 mM Gly, 250 mM NaCl, and 25 mM NaOH. The vials were placed
on a hot plate maintained at 130 °C for 12 h and left open to
evaporate to dryness during the heating period. The product was allowed
to cool and subsequently dissolved in 4.0 mL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) in water at room temperature for analysis by the IP-HPLC
method described above. We determined the combined yield of all of
the linear oligomers of glycine (Gly≥2) to be 49.5
± 2.0% (95% confidence interval, based on the measurement of
three samples, see Figure 4 and Table S3 in the Supporting Information). Cronin reported a yield of “ca. 45%” in an identical
experiment.34

Figure 4 IP-HPLC chromatogram
of the product mixture from the oligomerization
of glycine described in the Results section.
The total yield of linear oligomers (based on initial glycine, excluding
DKP as an undesirable product) was determined to be 49.5 ± 2.0% .

Discussion
We
began from the IP-HPLC method for the analysis of oligoglycine
originally reported by Rode and used by both Ohara and Cronin.21,34,39 The technique appears to be limited
by the solubility of Glyn oligomers in
the running buffer. When we analyzed a commercial sample of poly(glycine)
with molecular weight cutoff of approximately 5000 g/mol, the chromatogram
comprised peaks that we felt comfortable integrating up to Gly14 (details available in the Supporting Information, Figure S19). The higher peaks faded into the baseline
and broke in the pattern of having progressively longer differences
in retention time from the previous oligomer. In the preparation of
the polyglycine sample, some of the solid did not dissolve—likely
higher oligomers that are insoluble or poorly/partially soluble. Cronin
and co-workers noted similar behavior in their samples from the condensation
of Gly.34 Reanalysis of the solid by IP-HPLC
found oligomers that were presumably saturated in the first sample.
They also analyzed the undissolved solid by MALDI MS and identified
oligomers up to Gly20. As noted previously, MS methods
are useful for the qualitative determination of the presence of oligomers,
but samples with high salt can be difficult to analyze quantitatively.

We attempted to modify the IP-HPLC method to enable quantitative
analysis of longer oligomers by addition of water-miscible organic
solvents, like acetonitrile, to the running buffer to improve the
solubility of the longer Glyn species.
However, in all attempts, the cosolvent drastically and unfavorably
altered the retention times and resolution of the oligomers. We also
attempted to optimize the separation by testing alkylsulfonates of
different lengths (with C6, C8, and C10 alkyl chains) but returned to hexanesulfonate as the best option.

When optimizing conditions for the separation of oligoglycines,
we paid particular focus to the separation of Gly3 and
Gly4. For unknown reasons, these peaks run closer together
than other oligomers. Their resolution vastly improved upon switching
to a column with a lower particle size (3 vs 5 μm) and increasing
the flow rate (up to 1.0 mL/min). Following these modifications, the
method reported here can give near-baseline resolution of the linear
Glyn oligomers (n ≥
2), which compares favorably to previous separations (Figure 4).34,55 Glycine and DKP coelute, but their mutual interference is not necessarily
a significant limitation to the evaluation of prebiotic systems (see
the section on Guidance for Reporting Yields, below).

Method Validation
The concentration of each Glyn oligomer in a sample is measured by integrating
its peak in the chromatogram and dividing by the corresponding molar
response factor measured or calculated from standards (Table 1). We rely on external standards
because the chromatogram is already crowded with Glyn peaks, and the inclusion of an extra analyte would interfere
with measurement of the oligomers.

To verify the accuracy of
the method, we compared the total concentration of Gly (in all forms
of Glyn) in a standard sample of mixed
Glyn standards (n = 1–6)
measured by both quantitative NMR spectroscopy and the IP-HPLC method
described above. The concentrations measured by the two methods differed
by just 3.2% (see the Supporting Information, Figure S17 and Table S2).

Guidance for Reporting Yields
Quantitative
analysis
provides useful information with respect to evaluating prebiotic syntheses,
and in the context of oligoglycine synthesis, there have been a variety
of approaches. Conversions and yields are the standard metrics of
synthetic reactions.56 In theory, the simplest
approach to analyze the efficiency of oligomerization would be to
measure the remaining Gly and calculate its conversion—the
percentage of it consumed in the reaction, assuming that all of the
consumed glycine was converted to higher oligomers. However, in practice,
Gly often coelutes with other byproducts or—in the case of
nonchromatographic techniques—interferes with the signal for
other analytes, which prevents a quantitative measure of Gly alone.
Additionally, such an approach would not penalize side reactions like
pyrolysis of glycine or the formation of prebiotically undesirable
byproducts, such as diketopiperizine (DKP).57

Yields of the individual Glyn oligomers—calculated
from their UV responses—are more robust metrics for the evaluation
of peptide syntheses than single values for the conversion of glycine.
The molar response factors (fn) measured by our method permit the determination of the yield
of each oligomer with a distinct peak. It is clear from comparison
of the chromatogram for authentic low-molecular-weight (LMW) polyglycine
and that of the prebiotic oligomerization reaction that there are
products of the reaction that are not Glyn oligomers. We have not attempted to characterize these side products,
but MS would be helpful in this regard. It is possible that unknown
side products are coeluting with some of the Glyn oligomers, possibly inflating the calculated yields of one
or more of the individual oligomers. Based on the characteristic stability
of amino acids and peptides, as well as the sharpness of the peaks
in our chromatograms, we believe the presence of these side products
is small relative to the peptide oligomers expected as products of
the reaction.

Assumptions and Limitations
Our
method relies on the
assumption that the trend in the molar UV response observed in our
Glyn standards continues linearly through
Gly14. An advantage of using isocratic LC is that the oligomers
all elute in the same solvent. By analyzing the standards in the same
solvent, we can ensure that there are no variations based on changes
to the molar absorptivities of the analytes across a gradient of solvents.
Reports in the literature disagree as to whether these effects are
significant or not.58,59 Furthermore, we operate under
the assumption that any potential secondary structures that may form
in longer oligomers do not significantly impact the UV absorption
of those analytes. We also assume that no byproducts of the reaction
are coeluting with the oligomers of glycine. And as with other methods
that use external standards, our method functions on the assumption
that the instrument is precise and reproducible in delivering consistent
injection volumes, which is reasonable, given the reproducibility
of the data obtained on our standards.

The biggest limitation
of the method is the reliable quantification of products that are
not soluble in water. The solubility of oligomers of glycine appears
to decrease as the number of residues increases. If a sample of Glyn is completely soluble in the running buffer,
the IP-HPLC method will permit separation and accurate quantitative
analysis. A significant limitation is that if there is any remaining
solid that does not dissolve, the quantitative analysis will be flawed,
as the solid sample will contain an unknown amount of Glyn oligomers. Attempts to dissolve the remaining solid
and subject it to a second analytical run will be frustrated for the
least soluble, higher oligomers. Fortunately, the vast majority of
glycine oligomerizations reported in the literature produce mixtures
of Glyn suitable for quantitative analysis
by IP-HPLC. Only a few reports generate high enough yields of longer
oligomers to preclude their complete analysis. Researchers should
be careful to note whether their samples dissolve completely when
reporting Glyn products and their yields.

In the future, as syntheses become progressively better in terms
of yielding longer oligomers, it will be increasingly important for
the field to develop a technique for the convenient quantitative analysis
of these compounds. In the absence of such a method, researchers could
draw incorrect conclusions when comparing multiple systems on the
basis of yield. For example, if a significant portion of the starting
material is converted into insoluble products that are not included
in the chromatographic analysis, then the total yield of oligomers
will be artificially undercalculated. A system with a lower overall
yield, but no insoluble products, might erroneously appear to have
a higher yield than a comparable system that did generate insoluble
Glyn oligomers. It appears that future
techniques will require analyte derivatization and/or nonaqueous solvents
to overcome the limitation of the solubility of Gly>14 in
water, but the use of these solvents poses a challenge for the effective
separation of all of the analytes in the product mixtures.

Context
We wish to be clear about what we believe to
be the main contributions of this paper. The idea of condensing glycine
and other amino acids has a long history in origins-of-life research,
but the vast majority of studies only report the synthesis of Gly≤6. These studies determine yields by comparison to
standard samples of these oligomers, which can be obtained commercially.
Despite the long history of work in this field, amino-acid oligomerizations
and polymerizations are still a very active area of research. Recently,
several systems have “taken off” in terms of producing
oligomers of n > 6. These successes have introduced
the challenge of analyzing mixtures of Gly>6, as these
compounds are not easily purchased or synthesized in sufficient mass
and purity to use as standards. The inaccessibility of these standards
necessitated the development of a means of extrapolating information
about higher oligomers in order to characterize mixtures.

We
were skeptical that the molar UV response factors of higher oligomers
could be accurately extrapolated from Gly1–4. While
the addition of each residue to longer oligomers (e.g., Gly12 to Gly13 to Gly14) places each chromophore
in roughly the same environment, we expected addition of an extra
residue to shorter oligomers to have less predictable consequences.
After all, in shorter oligomers, the central residues are closer to
the polar/charged C- and N-termini. The termini are also closer to
each other in shorter oligomers, and we thought that it was unsound
to assume that these differences would have no effect on absorptivity
of the amide bonds. Therefore, we made it a point in this study to
carefully measure the molar response factors of as many oligomers
as possible to determine a proper calibration curve to extrapolate
values of fn for longer
oligomers. In a previous study of a different system, Codari et al.
established that the response factors for oligo(lactic acid)—from
hydrolysis of the parent polyester—are linear by measuring
up to n = 9.60 Similar
to our approach described here, they used their data to extrapolate
UV responses for higher oligomers. For the case of glycine oligomers,
it appears that the extrapolation of fn values for Gly>7 is best obtained
from
a linear regression curve fitted to Gly3–6 (over
Gly1–6 or Gly1–3) because of the
smaller deviation of that line through the longer standards.

We also wish to be clear that IP-HPLC has existed for a long time.
Rode first employed it for the analysis of glycine oligomerizations.21 Cronin used it recently to analyze Gly≥6,34 and in this paper, we report modifications
to the method to improve resolution of peaks and ensure the quantitative
rigor of the analysis. We are unaware of better separations of Gly3 and Gly4 by IP-HPLC.

Conclusions
IP-HPLC
offers a simple, robust, and convenient method for the
quantitative analysis of condensation reactions of glycine. These
reactions are of particular interest to the study of the origins of
life. Over the years, research groups interested in the origins of
life have employed a variety of methods to analyze condensation reactions
of glycine and other amino acids. Yields in these systems are complicated
metrics, as a wide mixture of products is produced. But having a simple,
sensitive, and reliable method to quantify the products is vital when
comparing multiple systems and studying experimental parameters. Although
this method has limitations because of the solubility of products,
it offers advantages compared to other methods with regard to improved
resolution and robustness of the analysis of oligomers for which pure
standards cannot be obtained. Oligomers higher than Gly15 have been synthesized in proposed prebiotic systems and detected
by MS; thus, the development of methods that enable the quantitative
analysis of these oligomers—which are practically insoluble
in aqueous media—would be valuable for this field.

Methods
Design
Our interest in studying amino-acid condensations,
coupled with the variety of approaches to their analysis, motivated
our search for a robust and reliable method to quantify glycine oligomerization
reactions. We expect to produce higher oligomers of Glyn for which standards can be challenging to synthesize
in high yield and purity. The lack of standards presents a problem
for estimating the concentration of longer products in calculations
of yield. We found previously reported methods to be lacking in one
or more of the following characteristics: (i) they did not attempt
to quantify higher oligomers, (ii) they extrapolated a trend for molar
absorptivity based on a few short oligomers, with n < 4, or (iii) they did not describe the quantification of higher
oligomers in detail. We were also troubled by the resolution of many
of the reported separations, where overlapping peaks would hinder
accurate determination of the UV response of individual oligomers
in a sample. The separation of Gly3 and Gly4 can be particularly difficult.34

Our general approach entailed verifying, optimizing, and extending
the IP-HPLC method for the separation of glycine oligomers reported
by Rode and co-workers that was later modified by Cronin and co-workers.21,34 Once the method produced chromatograms with acceptable resolution
of peaks on our instrument, we were able to determine concentrations
of each oligomer based on their UV responses and then use the data
from standards to characterize reaction mixtures of glycine condensations
under prebiotic conditions.

Materials, Safety, and General Procedures
All reagents,
including glycine, oligomers of glycine up to Gly6, and
LMW polyglycine were obtained from MilliporeSigma or VWR and their
affiliate suppliers and were not purified further. TFA is a strong
acid and care should be taken in its use. A standard of Gly8 was ordered for custom synthesis from Fisher Scientific USA. The
purity of this sample was checked by IP-HPLC and found to be contaminated
by other oligomers of glycine, including Gly, Gly6, Gly7, and Gly9 (Figure S1). As a result, we did not incorporate data collected on this sample
of Gly8 into our model for the extrapolation of molar response
factors (fn) of higher
oligomers.

Standard solutions of each oligomer were prepared
using a minimum of 10 mg of sample, and the solutions were prepared
using a volumetric flask (of at least 50 mL) for accuracy. These solutions
were diluted to five different concentrations using micropipettes,
giving five individual standards for each oligomer (Figure S2). This procedure was repeated three different times
for each oligomer of glycine, yielding three measurements for each
oligomer at five different concentrations (Figures S3–S9). The three trials for each oligomer at each concentration
were run with unique samples that were prepared individually for the
determination of the molar response factor (fn).

Experimental Parameters of the IP-HPLC Method
for the Quantification
of Glyn
Oligomers of glycine
were analyzed using IP-HPLC on a Shimadzu Prominence LC20-AR
instrument equipped with a Phenomenex Luna C18 column (250 mm long
× 4.6 mm diameter, 3 μm particle size). The mobile phase
was an aqueous solution of 50 mM KH2PO4 and
7.2 mM sodium hexanesulfonate (SHS), adjusted to pH 2.5 by the addition
of HPLC-grade 85% H3PO4. The mobile phase was
used isocratically with a flow rate of 1.00 mL·min–1. When preparing a column for its first use, the mobile phase was
passed through the column at 0.50 mL·min–1 for
12 h to establish an equilibrium with respect to adsorption of the
SHS ion-pair reagent on the C18 stationary phase, in essence, establishing
a modified stationary phase suitable for IP-HPLC. The column temperature
was maintained at 30 °C by a column oven, and samples were injected
in 5.0 μL aliquots by an autosampler to a 100 μL injection
loop. The instrument is equipped with a dual-wavelength UV–vis
detector, which was set to record absorbance at 195 and 214 nm. Our
analysis relies exclusively on the data collected at 195 nm, where
the analytes have higher molar absorptivity. With these experimental
parameters, we achieved separation of all of the linear oligomers
of glycine up to n = 14 in a commercial sample of
LMW polyglycine (Figure S19).
