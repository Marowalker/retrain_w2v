To
thrive as a global civilization, food production must meet the
demands of our ever-growing population. There are more than a billion
people on the planet suffering from malnutrition through poor quality
or lack of food. Nutrient content of food can be determined by a variety
of methods, which have issues such as slow analysis or sample destruction.
Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a long-standing alternative to
these methods. In this work, we demonstrated that Raman spectroscopy
(RS), another spectroscopic method, can also be used to assess the
nutrient content of maize (Zea mays), one of the most widely cultivated grains in the world. Using a
handheld Raman spectrometer, we predicted the content of carbohydrates,
fibers, carotenoids, and proteins in six different varieties of maize.
This analysis requires only a single maize kernel and is fast (1s),
portable, noninvasive, and nondestructive. Moreover, we showed that
RS in combination with chemometric methods can be used for highly
accurate (approximately 90%) spectroscopic typing of maize, which
is important for plant breeders and farmers. Finally, we demonstrate
that Raman-based approach is as accurate as NIR analysis. These findings
suggest that portable Raman systems can be used on combines and grain
elevators for autonomous control of grain quality.

Introduction
Food quality has a direct impact on the
economic growth of nations
and global food security. Therefore, food quality is strictly regulated
in many developed countries in the world.1 There are many parameters, such as nutrient content, texture, flavor,
and visual appearance, which are used to evaluate the quality of food.
However, two of them, the presence of pathogens2,3 and
nutrient content, have major impacts on human well-being.

The
nutrient content of food is determined by the amount of carbohydrates,
proteins, fibers, and oils, as well as by vitamins and minerals present
in it. Several colorimetric and chromatographic methods can be used
for quantitative assessment of these nutrients. These methods are
destructive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. Also, these assays
require sophisticated laboratory equipment, which is often not available
in developing countries.4 Development of
near-infrared (NIR) analyzers enabled completely noninvasive and nondestructive
assessment of nutrient content in agricultural crops.5−9 Some nutritional qualities assayable by NIR include moisture, starch,
protein, and many others.10 This method
is also capable of determining the nutrient content of single grains
of crops such as maize or wheat.11−13

A potential alternative
or complementary method to NIR is Raman
spectroscopy (RS). The Raman effect is based on the inelastic scattering
of photons by sample molecules that are being excited to higher vibrational
or rotational states.14 Thus, RS provides
information about molecular vibrations and consequently the structure
and composition of the analyzed sample. Our group recently demonstrated
that RS could be used for confirmatory, noninvasive, and nondestructive
detection and identification of fungal diseases in wheat, maize, and
sorghum seeds.15,16 We have also shown that RS could
detect insects inside intact cowpeas with high statistical accuracy.17 Also, using RS, we were able to diagnose nutrient
deficiency and asymptomatic Huanglongbing disease on orange and grapefruit
trees.18

In this study, we investigate
whether RS could be used for noninvasive,
nondestructive, confirmatory assessment of the nutrient content of
maize, one of the most widely cultivated cereals in the world.19 The commercial impact of maize exceeds 50 billion
U.S. dollars.20 Maize has a wide variety
of applications, including as livestock feed, raw material in industry,
biofuel, and a human food. We show that Raman-based approach is fast
and self-sufficient for the rapid assessment of nutrients in food.
We also show that in addition to nutrient content assessment, RS can
be used for the identification or typing of maize.

Results and Discussion
We collected more than 600 Raman spectra from six different varieties
of maize (Zea mays). Maize varieties
that have been chosen for our experiment had a distinctly different
phenotypic appearance, Figure 1. Specifically, we have
chosen three light color (small yellow (SY), large yellow (LY), and
small white (SW)) and three dark color (purple (PP), blue (BL), and
red (RD)) maize varieties.

Figure 1 Photographs of small white (SW), small yellow
(SY), extra-large
(XL), blue (BL), purple (PP), and red (RD) maize kernels.

Raman-Based Assessment of Nutrient Content
We have
found that all six varieties of maize had similar spectral profiles
with different intensities of vibrational bands, which can be assigned
to carbohydrates, carotenoids, fibers (lignin), and proteins, Figure 2A and Table 1. Interestingly, the spectra
collected from colored maize varieties (BL, PP, RD) exhibited a much
lower intensity of these vibrational bands compared to the spectra
acquired from yellow or pale color (SY, LY, SW) kernels. One can imagine
that dark maize kernels absorb more and consequently scatter less
light compared to the yellow or pale color kernels. Since RS is based
on inelastic light scattering, dark color maize varieties should produce
less intense spectra (under the same experimental conditions) compared
to the light color maize varieties. Therefore, observed variations
in spectral intensities likely originate from different light absorption
and scattering properties of these maize kernels.

This observation indicates that raw
spectra collected from colored
maize kernels cannot be used for direct assessment of their nutrient
content. For instance, the intensity of the 479 cm–1 band, which can be used to estimate the carbohydrate content in
the maize, appears lower in the spectra collected from PP maize compared
to that in LY or SY maize. However, this low intensity of this band
originates from the poor scattering properties of PP maize kernels
relative to those of LY or SY maize. This problem can be solved by
spectral normalization. However, normalizing spectra without an internal
standard is a challenging task. Normalization on one particular band
that can be assigned to the specific class of molecules, such as carbohydrates,
may not be appropriate. Such normalization would bias spectral interpretation
in regard to the nutrient content of that class of molecules. Because
the 1458 cm–1 band, assigned to CH2 vibrations,
cannot be associated with any specific class of biomolecule, we have
chosen to normalize our spectra to 1458 cm–1.

This unbiased spectral normalization can be used to access the
nutrient content of maize varieties. The analysis of variance (ANOVA)
of the 479 cm–1 band, which can be assigned to carbohydrates
such as monomeric sugars and starch, revealed two statistically significant
groups of maize (Figure 3). We found that the SY and RD carbohydrate contents were significantly
different from those of BL and PP. At the same time, SW and LY were
not significantly different from the first and second groups of maize,
respectively.

Figure 3 Means (circles) and confidence intervals for the intensities
of
the maize kernel spectra, normalized to 1458 cm–1, at the indicated Raman shift. Colors indicate significantly different
groups. Multiple colors indicate a member of a group that has overlap
between two separate groups. Each of (A)–(F) corresponds to
a different selected Raman shift discussed in the text.

Carotenoids exhibit bands around 1530 cm–1, which
can be assigned to in-plane −C=C– vibrations.
ANOVA revealed three statistically significant groups of maize based
on the intensities of these carotenoid bands. SW and RD had the lowest
carotenoid content and could be assigned to the first group. The carotenoid
content of this group is statistically different from that of BL.
Finally, SY, PP, and LY belong to the third group with the highest
carotenoid content. From Figure 3B, it is apparent that the darkness of a kernel is
not correlated with the intensity of the carotenoid band. Our results
support a previous hypothesis that the color of maize kernels is determined
by anthocyanins.21,22

Fibers are polyphenolic
molecular assemblies that have two distinct
vibrational bands in Raman spectra.23,24 The band at
1600 cm–1 can be assigned to C–C ring stretching
and symmetric C–H vibration.23 The
1632 cm–1 band originates from C=C aromatic
ring vibration.24 ANOVA revealed at least
two groups of maize based on the fiber content. Specifically, SY and
RD can be assigned to the first group with the lowest fiber content.
PP showed the highest fiber content that is statistically significant
from all other groups. Based on the intensity of 1600 cm–1 band, the fiber content in BL, SW, and LY is higher compared to
that in SY and RD, but lower than in PP. However, it is not statistically
different from SY, RD, and PP. At the same time, the analysis of the
intensity of 1632 cm–1 band showed that the fiber
content of LY is significantly different from both first (SY and RD)
and second (PP) groups, whereas BL and SW were not significantly different
from PP.

Proteins exhibit a carbonyl vibration of the peptide
bond at 1640–1670
cm–1, known as the amide I band, as well as a band
at 1000 cm–1, which can be assigned to phenylalanine.14 Both of these bands were observed in the Raman
spectra collected from maize kernels. At the same time, the band around
1650 cm–1 could be attributed to C=C bond
of unsaturated fatty acids, whereas 1000 cm–1 could
originate from carotenoid vibrations.25,31 Our results
reveal a very similar pattern for both 1000 and 1660 cm–1 bands indicating that these bands represent the same chemical structure.
Since the ANOVA pattern of both 1000 and 1660 cm–1 bands is distinctly different from the ANOVA pattern that was observed
from 1527 cm–1 band, which can be unambiguously
assigned to carotenoids, we can conclude that both 1000 and 1660 cm–1 bands in the Raman spectra of maize can be used to
reveal the protein content. We found that RD maize has the lowest
protein content, whereas BL, SW, SY, and PP have statistically higher
protein content.

These results clearly demonstrate that RS can
be used for fast
(1s spectral acquisition), noninvasive, and nondestructive assessment
of carbohydrates, proteins, fibers, and carotenoids in the intact
grain. When coupled to ANOVA, RS provides a highly accurate content
of these four classes of nutrients. Also, handheld spectrometer enables
the performance of this analysis directly in the field with only one
kernel required for quantitative elucidation of the grain nutrient
content.

The question to ask is how this information can be
related to nutrient
content analysis made by already established techniques. To answer
this question, we performed the analysis of the same grain samples
using NIR and determined protein and carbohydrate contents using the
Dumas combustion method32 and megazyme
total starch content assay (subsequently megazyme assay),33 respectively (Tables 2 and 3).

Content of Six Different Maize Varieties

SY	59.3	11.6	
PP	56.6	11.3	
RD	54.8	11.9	
LY	58.4	10.4	
According
to NIR analysis, the amount of starch was found to vary
in the maize varieties from 60.2 to 63.1%. Considering the fact that
the accuracy of such analysis is ±5%,34 NIR analysis suggests that there is no significant difference in
starch content among the maize varieties. According to the results
of megazyme assay, starch content varies from 54.6 to 59.3% (±3%).33 These results can also be used to reference
Raman readings to the starch content. Thus, 2.55–2.9 scale
in the Raman can be assigned to 57% of starch by the dry weight. Although
RS reveals two statistically different groups of maize based on their
starch content (Figure 3), the lack of accuracy expressed by already established methods
does not allow us to prove that RS is more accurate in the prediction
of starch content than NIR and megazyme assay.

Our NIR results
indicated that the amount of protein in the analyzed
samples varied from 10.0 to 12.0%. It is expected that reported values
have a precision ranging from 3 to 6%.32 Dumas combustion analysis revealed similar values of protein content
in the analyzed maize kernels (10.4–11.9%). However, the accuracy
of this method ranges between 2 and 4%.32 These results suggest that 0.05–0.1 scale in Raman corresponds
to 11.2% of protein. Thus, the same as in the case of starch, the
lack of accuracy expressed by both NIR and Dumas assays does not allow
us to prove that RS is more accurate in the prediction of protein
content.

Raman-Based Typing of Maize Varieties
We conducted
partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)35 to demonstrate that RS can be used for typing of these
maize varieties. The model was built using all 613 spectra with the
mean offset removed at each wavenumber and cross-validated with the
same data partitioned by the venetian blinds method.36 This model contained 19 latent variables (LVs) and was
used to generate a misclassification table (Table 4). The first three LVs explain 94.6, 1.7,
and 0.7% of the variation, respectively. The misclassification table
reports the true positive rate (accuracy) of the model; green cells
in the table indicate members of a class that were correctly assigned
to their class during cross-validation. Overall, we can see that the
model performs with an 89% classification accuracy at minimum.

Table 4 Misclassification Table of Cross-Validation
for the PLS-DA Model
 	members	correct (%)	BL	SW	SY	PP	RD	LY	
BL	113	98	111	0	0	0	2	0	
SW	100	98	0	98	2	0	0	0	
SY	98	94	0	0	92	1	2	3	
PP	100	89	5	2	0	89	1	3	
RD	100	99	0	0	1	0	99	0	
LY	102	94	0	0	5	1	0	96	
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that RS in combination with advanced statistical
analysis can be used to predict the nutrient content of carbohydrates,
carotenoids, fibers, and protein in intact maize kernels. We have
also shown that RS is capable of highly accurate typing of maize grain.
Thus, this study shows that RS is a highly efficient multifunctional
method for the analysis of grain.

Materials and Methods
Maize
Six different varieties of maize (Zea mays) were purchased from Amish Country Popcorn
(Berne, Indiana) and used as received.

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectra were collected with
a handheld Resolve Agilent spectrometer equipped with an 831 nm laser
and a spectral resolution of 15 cm–1. The following
experimental parameters were used for all collected spectra: 1s acquisition
time, 495 mW power, surface scanning mode, and baseline spectral subtraction
by device software. Spectra shown in the manuscript are baseline-corrected
by the instrument software without smoothing. One spectrum was collected
per one maize kernel.

Spectral Processing
Spectral processing
(described
below) and averaging were conducted using PLS_Toolbox 8.6.2 (Eigenvector
Research, Inc., Manson, WA).

Statistical Analysis
Raman spectra
were imported into
Matlab (Mathworks) and assigned a class based on their visual phenotype
(color). For ANOVA, spectra were normalized to the 1458 cm–1 band. For PLS-DA, the mean offset was removed at each wavenumber
before analysis.

NIR Analysis
PerkinElmer DA 7250
NIR analyzer was used
to determine the amount of protein, starch, oils, moisture, and ash
in six varieties of maize. For each maize variety, ∼30 g of
material was submitted to the analyzer.

Chemical Content Analysis
Phenolic content was measured
according to the Folin–Ciocalteu method.37 Total protein concentration was determined by combustion
using LECO instrument and a nitrogen-to-protein conversion factor
of 5.7.37 Total starch content was found
using the megazyme assay kit, based on the RTS-NaOH procedure from
the AACC 76.13 and AOAC 999.11 methods (K-TSTA; Megazyme, Bray, Ireland).
