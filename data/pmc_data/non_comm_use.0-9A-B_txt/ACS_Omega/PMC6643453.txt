In
order to highlight the applications of bioflavonoids in materials
chemistry, naringin and its chalcone form were used in the nanomaterial
synthesis to produce flavonoid-conjugated nanomaterials in aqueous
phase. Chalcone form proved to be excellent reducing as well as stabilizing
agent in the synthesis of monodisperse Au, Ag, and Pd nanoparticles
(NPs) of ∼5–15 nm, following in situ reaction conditions
where no external reducing or stabilizing agents were used. The mechanism
of NP surface adsorption of flavonoid was determined with the help
of dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements. Surface-adsorbed
flavonoids also allowed NPs to easily transfer into the organic phase
by using aqueous insoluble ionic liquid. Pd NPs attracted the excessive
amount of surface adsorption of both naringin as well as its chalcone
form that in turn drove Pd NPs in self-assembled state in comparison
to Au or Ag NPs. An amount of surface-adsorbed flavonoids selectively
determined the extraction of protein fractions from complex zein corn
starch protein solution. Self-assembled Pd NPs with a large amount
of surface-adsorbed naringin preferentially extracted zein fraction
of higher molar mass, whereas Au and Ag NPs almost equally extracted
the zein fractions of lower molar masses.

Introduction
Bitter taste of the
grapefruit juice stems from a very important
flavonoid naringin, a polyphenolic natural product, that metabolizes
to naringenin in the human physiological system with extraordinary
health benefits such as antioxidant, anticancer, and antihepatitis
C virus production and is a useful ingredient in the formulations
of cardio-vascular treatments.1−3 This unique flavonoid still remains
elusive for its applications in the synthesis of nanomaterials with
possible implications in food and pharmaceutical industries.4−6 Naringin is water-soluble and can be easily used in aqueous-based
green synthesis of different nanomaterials. The most important and
significant property of naringin is its transformation into corresponding
chalcone (Figure 1),
a semisynthetic sweetener in the basic medium with considerable commercial
potential.7−9 This is well documented in several previous studies10,11 and very much depends on the pH. An appropriate treatment of chalcone
solution with HCl and NaCl allows it to extract in semisolid or powder
form of light yellow color. In this study, we demonstrate the potential
of both naringin as well as chalcone in the synthesis of different
nanomaterials, which stems from the metal-chelating12,13 ability of flavonoids with transition metal ions through strong
complexation. Several studies have been devoted in this direction,
where these complexes act as strong antioxidants and anti-free radical
agents.14,15 Usually, the most abundant metal complexes
are composed of one deprotonated flavonoid molecule, transition metal
ion, and an additional neutral flavonoid molecule. Chelate complexes
are mainly square planar as in the case of CuII with coordination
from hydroxyl group of carbon 5 and carbonyl moiety at carbon 4 on
the ring 2 (Figure 1).12,13 However, multiple coordination sites are
also expected depending on the oxidation state of the metal ion.

Figure 1 Molecular
structures of naringin and its chalcone form.

As coordination reduces the electron density on flavonoid,
flavonoid
acts as a good reducing agent to convert metal ions into corresponding
nanoparticles (NPs). We have explored and compared this ability of
naringin and its chalcone in the synthesis of Au, Ag, and Pd NPs in
different media to demonstrate their respective potential for different
nanomaterials synthesis, their surface adsorption behavior, and applications
of flavonoid-conjugated nanomaterials for protein extraction. Electron
donating behavior of naringin promotes its excellent complexing and
flocculating abilities to extract nanomaterials from the aqueous suspensions.
Flavonoid–protein interactions16−18 is another important
subject in view of designing new naringin-inspired drugs. This can
be very well exploited by using flavonoid-conjugated nanomaterials
in selective extraction of proteins from complex biological mixtures
with possible ramifications in biotechnology. We demonstrate this
by using naringin-conjugated NPs for the extractions of protein fractions
from aqueous solutions of zein protein which is an important component
of corn starch protein and possesses numerous applications in the
food industry. Thus, the aim of present study is to explore and highlight
the fundamental materials chemistry19,20 aspects of
both naringin and its chalcone in synthesizing flavonoid-conjugated
nanomaterials with possible implications in food and pharmaceutical
industries.

Results and Discussion
Photophysical Properties of Naringin
Aqueous solution
of naringin exhibits a remarkable color change when its pH is changed
from neutral to basic by using NaOH because of its gradual conversion
into chalcone (Figure 2a). Highly dilute solution of naringin (<1 mM) provides most of
the peaks in the UV region due to π → π* transitions
of ring 1,21 however, higher concentration
(ca. 50 mM) produces a main prominent peak around 390 nm (Figure 2a) that red-shifts
into the visible region as pH increases. This provides a bright yellow-orange
color (see the color change in cuvettes) because of the ionization
of the phenolic groups of flavonoid.19 The
mechanism for the flavanone–chalcone isomerization equilibrium
of naringin in basic medium is carried out through the carbanion intermediate21 and brings a large increase in the intensity
and wavelength shift (∼110 nm) over a pH range from 7 to 12
as depicted in the inset of Figure 2a. The corresponding fluorescence emission spectrum
of aqueous naringin shows strong emission around 490 nm when excited
at 390 nm (Figure 2b). A remarkable quenching of this emission band with significant
red shift occurs as the pH of the medium increases. Both fluorescence
intensity and wavelength shift have been plotted in the inset, where
actual flavanone–chalcone isomerization occurs around pH 11.2.
Interestingly, addition of HCl to naringin solution reduces the pH
but does not affect the absorption spectrum (Supporting Information, Figure S1) because it only induces the protonation
of naringin.

Flavanone–Chalcone-Mediated Synthesis
of Au NPs
Flavanone–chalcone isomerization under the
effect of pH variation
demonstrates dramatic effects on the synthesis of Au NPs. At low pH,
few settled Au NPs are produced (Figure 3a, see bottle “E”), and the
in situ reduction reaction is not significant because the protonated
form of naringin is unable to effectively reduce Au(III) into Au(0),
and hence, no colloidal suspension is produced. However, the reaction
facilitates at neutral pH (bottle “B”) with a better
yield but NPs got aggregated and no colloidal suspension is obtained.
The reaction is highly facilitated in the basic medium (bottle “F”),
where the chalcone form proves to be an excellent reducing as well
as stabilizing agent in comparison to naringin because of the open
ring 2 (Figure 1) that
provides better fluxional ability for the chelation. It results in
a fine colloidal suspension.22 Interestingly,
if we decant the upper clear solutions of bottles “E”
and “B” that contain excess of aqueous naringin, then
purify NPs with pure water, collect them, and add 0.1 M aqueous NaOH,
we get a bright orange colloidal suspension of NPs simply by agitating
the solution because of the formation of chalcone (see cuvette “C”)
that gives strong characteristic absorbance band of chalcone around
480 nm in basic medium (as noted previously in Figure 2a) and a very weak broad hump because of
the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Au NPs around 680 nm19 (Figure 3b, indicated by a block arrow). In contrast, if we dissolve
the settled Au NPs of bottle “B” in glycerol rather
than aqueous NaOH, we get a dark colloidal suspension (cuvette D)
with no absorbance of chalcone around 480 nm. Rather a combination
of characteristic band of naringin appears between 300 and 400 nm
in its neutral form (Figure 3c) and a much stronger absorbance of Au NPs at shorter wavelength
around 560 nm is produced. A large difference in the absorbance of
Au NPs in Figure 3b
(at 680 nm) and in Figure 3c (at 560 nm) is simply due to an extent of self-aggregation
in the two different colloidal solutions, that is, in the basic medium
and glycerol, respectively. Thus, Au NPs produced at pH 2.5 and 7
under in situ reaction conditions of naringin can be made colloidal
suspensions in basic medium and/or in glycerol in neutral medium,
whereas Au NPs produced at pH 11.5 (bottle “F”) can
be easily extracted in the organic phase by using water-insoluble
ionic liquids (ILs) such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate
(see sequence “F → G → H”).23

mM of aqueous HAuCl4, at pH = 2.5, 7, and 11.5. Bottles

Au NP solutions prepared, respectively. Au NPs of bottle “E”
and “B” can be made stable suspensions with basic medium
and glycerol, respectively, while that of “F” can be
extracted into the organic phase. (b,c) UV–visible scans of
the respective samples. TEM images of Au NPs (d) prepared with naringin
and (e–g) prepared with its chalcone. Inset of (g) depicts
the XRD patterns of Au NPs. See details in text.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Au NPs synthesized
by using naringin (at pH 7) and chalcone (at pH 11.5) are shown in Figure 3d–g, respectively.
Chalcone is considered to be a much better reducing and shape controlling
agent to produce relatively smaller spherical NPs less than 10 nm
though they mostly exist in the merged state with one another in comparison
to naringin. Naringin produces NPs of variable sizes (7–40
nm) and shapes along with long needles of self-crystallized naringin
(Figure S2). Naringin is known for its
self-crystallization under different experimental conditions.6,24−26 Several factors lead to the crystallization of naringin
and among them presence of salts or different solubility criteria
are the main forces that drive naringin molecules for self-crystallization.

Morphology-controlled growth of a crystal lattice of Au NP as observed
in Figure 3e–g
mainly depends on the surface adsorption behavior of a stabilizing
agent.27,28 Chalcone possesses greater amphiphilicity
because of the open ring structure in comparison to naringin and that
in turn facilitates a better surface adsorption of chalcone. Thus,
surface-adsorbed chalcone provides necessary colloidal stability and
hence produces fine colloidal suspension (Figure 3a(F)) unlike to that of naringin (Figure 3a(B)). A better surface
adsorption of a stabilizing agent on the surface of growing nucleating
center passivates different crystal planes and limits their participation
in further crystal growth22 that generates
mainly spherical morphologies as shown in Figure 3e. In spherical morphologies, all crystal
planes of the nucleating center participate almost equally in the
growth process as evident from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of fcc crystal structure shown in the inset of Figure 3g. The peaks at 38.1°, 44.4°, 64.5°,
77.5°, and 81.2° are indexed as {111}, {200}, {200}, {311},
and {222} facets, respectively, and are consistent with fcc geometry
of Au bulk. However, most of the NPs are merged with one another which
might have triggered mainly due to strong hydrogen bonding existing
between different hydroxyl groups of surface-adsorbed chalcone molecules
that may lead to interparticle fusion of growing nucleating centres.20

Ag and Pd NPs Synthesis
Naringin
is unable to reduce
the Ag+ into Ag0 in acidic medium (Figure 4a(A)), while the
reduction is low at neutral pH (Figure 4a(B)) but significantly facilitated in basic medium
(Figure 4a(C)). Here
too, the chalcone form possesses stronger reduction potential to convert
Ag+ into Ag0 in comparison to naringin as observed
previously for the Au NPs. Extraction of the Ag NPs from “bottle
C” into the organic phase can be done by using IL as shown
in the sequence of “D → E” that produces a clear
characteristic absorbance due to SPR around 420 nm (Figure 4b). TEM images of samples prepared
at pH 7 and 11.5 are shown in Figure 4c,d and e,f, respectively. The former sample produces
mainly long needles of crystallized naringin with embedded Ag NPs
while the latter sample produces mainly monodisperse small Ag NPs.
A low-resolution TEM image of naringin microneedles is shown in Figure S3, while a magnified image of a section
of needle is shown in Figure 4c. Ag NPs can be seen as black dots embedded on the surface
of microneedles. Its high-resolution image clearly shows the embedded
crystalline Ag NP of ∼16 nm (Figure 4d). Ag NPs produced in basic medium are spherical
and highly monodisperse of ≤20 nm (Figure 4e,f), and their corresponding XRD patterns
depicting the fcc crystal structure are shown in the inset of Figure 4f. All peaks29 show almost equal and prominent crystal growth
spread over all crystal planes of fcc geometry leading to spherical
monodisperse morphologies demonstrating fine shape control effect
of chalcone.

mM of aqueous AgNO3, at pH = 2.5, 7, and 11.5. Bottles

Ag NP solutions prepared, respectively. No reaction occurs at pH 2.5.
Solution “C” can be extracted into the organic phase,
and (b) its corresponding UV–visible spectra with different
concentrations of naringin. Panels (c,d) show the TEM images of self-crystallized
naringin along with entrapped Au NPs prepared at pH 7, while (e,f)
images of monodispersed Ag NPs prepared by using its chalcone at pH
11.5. Inset of (f) depicts the XRD patterns of Ag NPs. See details
in text.

Similarly, both naringin and its
chalcone produce fine Pd NPs but
naringin also crystallizes in large flakes (Figure S4) at neutral pH that produces a dark yellow suspension (see
the yellow color of the bottle before and after the reaction in the
inset of Figure 5a)
while entrapping tiny Pd NPs of ≤5 nm (Figure 5a). A high-resolution image of single Pd
NP shows that it is bound with mainly {110} crystal planes (Figure 5b). When the same
reaction is conducted in basic medium, the reaction is quite facilitated
by chalcone and produces flowerlike assemblies30−32 of small Pd
NPs (Figure 5c). The
high-resolution image (Figure 5d) shows that groups of crystalline NPs of less than ∼4
nm are self-assembled in flowerlike arrangement which is usually induced
by the interparticle interactions driven by the surface adsorbed chalcone.
XRD patterns of this sample (Figure 5e) show only two weak diffraction peaks at 40.1°
and 46.6°, while other two peaks at 68.1° and 82.2°
of Pd fcc geometry are not visible. These peaks can be assigned to
the {111}, {200}, {220}, and {311} crystal planes of fcc crystalline
Pd.32 Rest of the peaks belong to crystallized
flavonoid and were not visible in the XRD patterns of Figures 3g and 4f for Au and Ag NPs, respectively, suggesting a much greater amount
of both naringin and chalcone adsorbed on Pd NPs rather than on Au
or Ag NPs. The origin of this is related to the noble nature of Au
and Ag while the Pd nanosurface is highly reactive and encourages
the adsorption and rearrangement of other molecules33,34 in terms of its catalytic behavior that promotes the excessive adsorption
of flavonoids.

details in text.

Surface Adsorption of Naringin
The surface adsorption
of naringin has been further evaluated by titrating presynthesized
citrate and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-stabilized Au/Ag/Pd
seeds (see the Experimental Section) with
naringin and simultaneously measuring UV–visible, dynamic light
scattering (DLS), and zeta potential. Figure 6a,b depicts the UV–visible profiles
of titration of naringin with citrate and CTAB-stabilized Au seeds.
Free naringin demonstrates two main absorptions at 283 nm corresponding
to ring “1” and another relatively weaker one at 327
nm due to ring “3” (see Figure 1),35 while a weak
broad band that emerges at 420 nm is due to the adsorption of naringin
on the citrate-stabilized seeds. The latter peak becomes highly prominent
and red-shifts with a dramatic increase in its intensity when instead
of citrate, CTAB-stabilized Au seeds are used (Figure 6b). It also eliminates the absorption at
283 nm, suggesting the fact that the adsorption of naringin on CTAB-stabilized
seeds is primarily induced by the ring “1” portion of
naringin. DLS measurements (hydrodynamic diameter) further supplement
this information. Stronger adsorption on CTAB-stabilized seeds leads
to a continuous increase in the size with a greater slope in comparison
to that on the citrate-stabilized seeds, which is considered to be
weaker and driven by the hydrogen bonding36,37 between the hydroxyl groups of naringin and tricarboxylic groups
of citrate. Stronger electrostatic interactions operate between electronegative
naringin due to the presence of several hydroxyl groups as well as
ether oxygens and cationic CTAB-stabilized seeds. CTAB-stabilized
seeds are always covered with a surfactant bilayer, where cationic
head groups are aqueous solubilized. This arrangement allows cationic
head groups to undergo electrostatic interactions with naringin molecules.
A similar behavior is observed for the adsorption of naringin on citrate
and CTAB-stabilized Ag seeds (Figure S5a), but no clear difference of naringin adsorption on citrate or CTAB-stabilized
Pd seeds can be made most probably due to the highly active nature
of Pd surface (Figure S5b).

Figure 6 (a,b) UV–visible
scans of titration of naringin with citrate-stabilized
and CTAB-stabilized Au seeds, respectively, at 70 °C. (c) plots
of corresponding DLS titrations depicting the size variation with
respect to the concentration of naringin. See details in text.

Zeta potential measurements provide
a better insight in the mechanism
of adsorption of naringin on charged NP surface, and the results are
presented in Figure 7. Figure 7a shows
that the positive potential of CTAB-stabilized Au seeds converts to
negative potential upon a complete deposition and passivation of the
NPs surfaces by 0.08 mM naringin which is ∼3 mole ratio of
CTAB-stabilized Au seeds/naringin. A similar behavior of zeta potential
of CTAB-stabilized Ag and Pd seeds is observed upon the addition of
naringin (Figure 7b,c)
with mole ratios 3 and 4, respectively. It clearly shows that the
deposition of naringin on positively charged CTAB-stabilized Au/Ag/Pd
seeds is driven by the electrostatic interactions between the cationic
ammonium head groups of CTAB and electronegative ether oxygens of
naringin. However, surface adsorption of naringin of citrate-stabilized
Au/Ag/Pd seeds seems to be quite different from the CTAB-stabilized
seeds. It occurs instantaneously and rapidly on citrate-stabilized
Ag and Pd seeds, prompting the change of negative zeta potential to
zero within the same concentration range as it happens on CTAB-stabilized
seeds (Figure 7b,c,
respectively). A change of negative zeta potential to zero suggests
the replacement of citrate by naringin on Ag/Pd surfaces that eventually
provides the negative zeta potential due to the presence of electron
rich hydroxyl and ether oxygens of naringin. In contrast, negative
zeta potential of citrate-stabilized Au seeds never reaches to zero
and remains almost unchanged up to the addition of 0.15 mM naringin
but increases thereafter and eventually merges with the profile of
CTAB-stabilized Au seeds around 0.2 mM naringin (Figure 7a). The origin of this behavior
is related to the adsorption strength of citrate ions on different
metallic surfaces. Citrate ions are excellent colloidal stabilizer
for nano-Au seeds in comparison to Ag or Pd of similar shape and size.
Citrate-stabilized Au seeds are stable for several weeks because of
the strong adsorption of citrate ions on Au surface.19,22 Naringin molecules are unable to replace the strongly adsorbed citrate
ions rather prefer to interact through hydrogen bonding that allows
the Au seeds to retain their negative zeta potential. This surface
adsorption behavior of naringin on different nanometallic surfaces
proves to be the determinant in protein extraction in the next section.

and CTAB (filled diamonds)-stabilized Au, Ag, and Pd seeds with naringin,

Protein Extraction and Characterization
Flavonoids
are also known for their interactions with proteins, and hence, Au/Ag/Pd
NPs synthesized under in situ reaction conditions at pH 7 (Figures 3–5, respectively) are used for the extraction of protein
fractions from zein corn starch protein aqueous suspension. Zein is
highly important and versatile protein23,38,39 because of its wide applicability in the food industry.
Extraction ability of purified NPs samples is demonstrated by using
the SDS page analysis as mentioned in the Experimental
Section, and the results are presented Figure 8. Pure zein provides bands of 21.3, 25.7,
45.7, and 66 kDa of four different fractions.23 The first two bands indicate the presence of α-zein,38,39 while the next two bands are due to dimerization or oligomerization.40 Unfolding of zein is related to the amount of
SDS used and low amounts of SDS, that is, in the low mM concentration
range greater than its critical micelle concentration partially reduce
zein.41 Partially reduced zein is prone
to oligomerization due to seeding42 which
is usually more prominent in the case of water insoluble proteins
because of the presence of large proportions of nonpolar amino acids. Figure 8a shows that some
typical SDS page scans for different NPs and the extraction of different
zein fractions are NPs specific. Quantitative interpretation is depicted
in Figure 8b, where
extraction ability of a specific NP sample in terms of relative band
intensity of SDS page analysis is plotted for each fraction.

Figure 8 (a) Typical
SDS page analysis scans of extracted zein protein fractions
picked by the samples of naringin-conjugated NPs prepared with 0.25
mM metal salts and different concentrations of naringin (5 mM = 1,
10 mM = 2, and 15 mM = 3). See NPs images in Figures 3–5. (b) Comparative
bar plots of relative amounts of the most abundant proteins picked
by different samples. See details in the text.

Pd NPs mainly pick the protein fraction of 66 kDa, while
Au/Ag
NPs pick almost all in relatively lower amounts except the zein fraction
of 66 kDa (Figure 8b). These preferences are primarily related to the amount of naringin
adsorbed and deposited on each kind of NP surface during the in situ
reaction conditions as well as nature of the metallic surfaces. Pd
NPs exist in highly aggregated state with a large amount of naringin
deposited on their surfaces (Figure 5). Therefore, an excessive amount of naringin coating
is probably driving the protein extraction, while there is no possibility
of protein fraction to directly adsorb on the naked Pd NP surface.
Thus, the surface adsorption of smaller fractions which usually prefer
naked metallic surfaces43−45 is unable to adsorb allowing
only the bigger fraction of 66 kDa to be extracted preferentially.
This is due to the fact that the smaller protein fractions are usually
less hydrophobic in comparison to bigger ones. Oligomeric fractions
(such as that of 66 kDa) attain greater nonpolarity due to the charge
neutralization or hydrogen bonding. Similarly, several layers of adsorbed
naringin on Pd NPs surface also attain greater nonpolarity due to
the hydrogen bonding that exists among naringin molecules and hence
prefers to extract zein fraction of 66 kDa rather than smaller fractions.
This is not the case for Au and Ag NPs, where no excessive amount
of naringin is visible in Figures 3 and 4, respectively, and hence,
the protein extraction is driven both by the surface adsorbed naringin
as well as naked Au/Ag surfaces. Both Au and Ag NPs show almost equal
preference for all zein fractions except that for 66 kDa, while Ag
NPs extract greater amount of each fraction in comparison to that
extracted by the Au NPs. Self-crystallization of naringin in large
needles (Figures 3 and 4) allows relatively much less amount of naringin
adsorbed on Au and Ag NPs surface, thereby allowing naked NP surface
an ideal choice for the smaller zein fractions to adsorb.

Concluding
Remarks
The present results conclude that
both naringin and its chalcone form can be used for the in situ synthesis
of flavonoid conjugated nanomaterials, but chalcone is much more effective
in reducing the metallic ions into nanometallic state, controlling
the crystal growth and producing stable colloidal suspensions of Au,
Ag, and Pd NPs. These NPs can be easily transferred to organic phase
by using the water-insoluble IL for their appropriate applications
in organic phase. The Au and Ag NPs are fairly monodisperse with a
size close to 15 nm, whereas Pd NPs are less than 5 nm. Among them,
the Pd NP surface attracts excessive deposition of both naringin as
well as chalcone that leads to the self-aggregation of Pd NPs. The
mechanism of NP surface adsorption of naringin is studied by using
the citrate and CTAB-stabilized presynthesized Au, Ag, and Pd seeds.
DLS and zeta potential measurements show that surface adsorption of
naringin is highly facilitated and closely controlled by both electrostatic
interactions as well as hydrogen bonding.

Naringin-conjugated
NPs demonstrated their excellent potential in protein fractions extraction
from aqueous zein suspension and that is clearly controlled by the
amount of naringin deposition on nanometallic surfaces. Pd NPs with
excessive deposition of naringin preferentially extract bigger or
oligomeric zein fraction, whereas both Au and Ag NPs with much less
amount of naringin adsorption only extract zein fractions of smaller
molar masses. These results highlight the potential uses of naringin-conjugated
NPs for their biotechnological applications with clear distinction
between the low and high molar masses of protein fractions.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Naringin from citrate fruit, chloroauric
acid (HAuCl4), silver nitrate (AgNO3), potassium
tetrachloropalladate (K2PdCl4), CTAB, sodium
borohydride (NaBH4), and citric acid trisodium salt (Na3Cit) were purchased from Aldrich. Double-distilled water was
used for all preparations. Extra care was taken to protect the aqueous
solution of HAuCl4 and AgNO3 from light. Both
solutions were used as freshly prepared and kept in the dark. Aqueous
solutions of NaBH4 and Na3Cit were always used
as freshly prepared.

Methods
Naringin–Chalcone-Mediated
Synthesis of Au, Ag, and Pd
NPs
Both naringin and its chalcone form were used for the
in situ synthesis of different nanomaterials without using any external
reducing or stabilizing agent. For a typical reaction in acidic, neutral,
or basic media, aqueous solutions of 5–40 mM naringin and 0.25
mM respective metal salts (HAuCl4, AgNO3, or
K2PdCl4) were taken in screw-capped glass bottles
and kept in a water thermostat bath (JULABO F25) at precise 70 ±
0.1 °C for 6 h under static conditions in the dark to protect
against photoreduction. After 6 h, the samples were cooled to room
temperature and kept for overnight. Each sample produced either settled
or suspended NPs suspensions, which were purified with pure water
at least three times. Purification was done by collecting the NPs
at 8000–10 000 rpm for 5 min after washing each time with distilled
water.

Flavonoid Complexation with Presynthesized NPs
Presynthesized
Au, Ag, and Pd NPs (seeds) were produced by mixing [HAuCl4]/[AgNO3]/[K2PdCl4] = 0.5 mM and
[Na3Cit] = 0.5 mM, followed by the addition of 0.6 mL of
ice cold aqueous NaBH4 ([NaBH4] = 0.1 mol dm–3) solution under constant stirring.19,20 This reaction produced citrate-stabilized polyhedral Au/Ag/Pd seeds
and are the best models to compare the adsorption of naringin on NP
surfaces with those produced above under in situ reaction conditions.
It was done by taking calculated amounts of presynthesized seeds in
small UV–visible cuvettes and then titrated with freshly prepared
aqueous naringin. Similar titrations were performed with DLS and zeta
potential measurements to determine the change in the size and polarity
of the seeds.

Characterization
Spectroscopic Analysis
Some of the reactions were simultaneously
monitored with the help of UV–visible (Shimadzu—model
no. 2450, double beam) and steady state fluorescence spectroscopy
(PTI QuantaMaster) measurements. Both instruments were equipped with
a TCC 240A thermoelectrically temperature-controlled cell holder that
allowed the measurement of the spectrum at a constant temperature
within ±1 °C.

Microscopy
All NP samples were characterized
by TEM
analysis on a JEOL 2010F system at an operating voltage of 200 kV.
The samples were prepared by mounting a drop of a solution on a carbon
coated Cu grid and allowed to dry in the air. DLS and zeta potential
measurements were performed using a light scattering apparatus (Zetasizer
Nano series, Nano-ZS, Malvern Instruments) equipped with a built-in
temperature controller with an accuracy of ±0.1 °C. The
measurements were made using a quartz cuvette with a path length of
1 cm. An average of 5 measurements was analyzed using the standard
algorithms with an uncertainty of less than 7%. Aqueous suspension
of each sample is placed in the cuvette to determine the size and
zeta potential. Size distribution histogram was constructed by using
the software provided with the instrument.

The XRD patterns
were characterized by using a Bruker-AXS D8-GADDS system with Tsec = 480. Samples were prepared on glass slides
by spotting a concentrated drop of aqueous suspension and were then
dried in a vacuum desiccator.

SDS Page Gel Electrophoresis
SDS page was used for
the characterization of zein protein fractions selectively extracted
by the flavonoid-conjugated NPs. Before the analysis, each purified
sample was assorted with 1× sample loading buffer and boiled
in a water bath at 100 °C to digest and dislodge the protein
complexed with naringin-protected nanomaterials. The suspension thus
obtained was subjected to SDS page analysis. The sample (10 μL)
was loaded in the well of 5% stacking gel which was solidified over
12% separating gel. The loaded gel was immersed with 1× Tris-glycine
SDS gel running buffer and was electrophoresed at 120 V and 10 mA.
The gel was stained and destained to obtain the clear visible bands.
