The high compressive strength of
cementitious materials stems from
the creation of a percolated network of calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H)
nanoparticles glued together by strong Ca2+–Ca2+ correlation forces. Although strong, the ion correlation
force is short range and yields poor elastic properties (elastic limit
and resilience). Here, the use of polycations to partially replace
Ca2+ counterions and enhance the resilience of cementitious
materials is reported. Adsorption isotherms, electrophoretic mobility,
as well as small angle X-ray scattering and dynamic rheometry measurements,
are performed on C–S–H gels, used as nonreactive models
of cementitious systems, in the presence of different linear and branched
polycations for various electrostatic coupling, that is, surface charge
densities (pH) and Ca2+ concentrations. The critical strain
of the C–S–H gels was found to be improved by up to
1 order of magnitude as a result of bridging forces. At high electrostatic
coupling (real cement conditions), only branched polycations are found
to improve the deformation at the elastic limit. The results were
corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations.

Introduction
Ordinary concrete,
that is, a mix of Portland cement and aggregates,
is the most highly used material in the world for housing and infrastructure
construction. In addition to its good compressive strength properties,
its omnipresence is explained by the low cost and the worldwide availability
of the cement constituents that happen to be among the main elements
of the earth’s crust (Si, Ca, O).1 However, the manufacturing of Portland cement clinker is responsible
for about 5% of human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide. The environmental
impact of cement production can be significantly lowered by improving
its mechanical properties, as this would allow both improvement in
the durability and a reduction in the amount of concrete used. Two
ways can be envisaged to do this. The first, which is largely employed,
consists of increasing the compressive strength by reducing the overall
porosity of the final material. This is achieved by lowering the added
water in the cement paste by using a fluidifying anionic comb-polyelectrolyte.2−4 The second method is improving the elasticity of the material. Within
this scope, various ways have been reported from the development of
composite materials5,6 to the control of defects (voids),
so called macro-defect-free (MDF) cements,7 to the synthesis of highly-organized hybrid calcium silicate hydrate
(C–S–H) mesocrystals.8 These
approaches rely on the control of the structure at the microscale
(MDF) or at the mesoscale (mesocrystal), or on the introduction of
a ductile phase (composite materials). We propose here, instead, to
modulate the interactions between cement hydrates by the use of cationic
polyelectrolytes.

The cohesive properties of hydrated cement
are due to the C–S–H
nanoparticles.9,10 C–S–H is a phyllosilicate
and presents a crystalline lamellar structure close to that of the
rare minerals tobermorite and/or jennite.11,12 Its exact structure is still an ongoing debate. The typical size
of a C–S–H particle ranges between 5 and 60 nm.10 The basal plane of the C–S–H particles
is covered with parallel silicate chains creating a high density of
titrating silanol groups. Under normal conditions of the hydrated
cement paste, this surface is in contact with an electrolyte solution
saturated with calcium hydroxide (about 20 mmol/L at pH = 12.5). In
such a solution, 90% of the surface silanols are deprotonated, that
is, negatively charged, and counterbalanced by divalent calcium ions.13 The attractive force arising between such particles
has been characterized by atomic force microscopy and is well described
by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations including the ion–ion correlations
neglected in the Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO) theory.13,14 Indeed, the approximate DLVO theory predicts repulsive forces between
surfaces, due to the entropy of the counterions.15,16 However, including ionic correlations gives rise to a net attractive
double layer interaction of purely electrostatic origin.17 This correlation attraction increases with increasing
pH (more silanol groups become deprotonated) or when monovalent counterions
are replaced with divalent ones (Ca2+).18,19 The main drawback of this correlation attraction is its very short
range, resulting in a low elastic deformation of the hydrated cement.19,20

In a recent work conducted by some of us,21 MC simulations showed that the addition of a positively
charge polyelectrolyte
should also create an attractive force, comparable in magnitude but
of longer range, as a result of a bridging mechanism. Prior to that,
the possibility of intercalating linear polycations in C–S–H
was investigated by two different groups.22,23 The long-range bridging is expected to significantly increase the
deformation at the elastic limit (critical strain) of hydrated cement
whilst having a small impact on the yield strength, significantly
improving the resilience of the material. The bridging can be modulated
by varying: (i) the chain length (i.e., molar mass), (ii) the charge
density, and (iii) the structure of the polymer. This work aims to
find, characterize, and rationalize the conditions for which a cement
with improved resilience can be developed using polycations having
different molar masses and structures. In this scope, C–S–H
suspensions obtained through a pozzolanic reaction are used as the
model system for cementitious materials. We determine the adsorption
isotherms of the different polymers employed. The impact of the polycation
on the electrokinetic charge, structure, and mechanical properties
of the gels is characterized by electrophoretic mobility, small angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS), and dynamic rheology, respectively. Finally,
the evolution of the mechanical properties is discussed in light of
MC simulations.

Results and Discussion
Adsorption Isotherms
Adsorption isotherms were determined
for the branched and the three linear polycations at various calcium
hydroxide concentrations. Figure 1a shows the adsorption data of the linear polymer of
intermediate molar mass (42 000 g/mol) at increasing calcium
concentrations from 1.0 to 21.3 mM and pH values ranging from 9.8
to 12.8. The full lines are the best (Levenberg–Marquardt)
fit to a Langmuir isotherm, see eq 1. The fitted parameters for all polyelectrolytes, K and Γmax, are given in Table 1. Note that the same behavior
is observed for all polyelectrolytes, see Supporting Information (Figures S1 and S2).

In the considered range
of pH (10 < pH < 13), the silanol
groups of the C–S–H surface become gradually deprotonated
and generate a strong negative surface charge, producing high-affinity
Langmuir isotherms at the lowest calcium concentrations, stemming
from electrostatic interactions between the positively charged polymers
and the surface.13 Overall, polyelectrolyte
adsorption and its affinity K decreases with increasing
calcium hydroxide concentration, in good agreement with MC simulation
predictions,21 due to the competition between
polycations and Ca2+ as counterions to the C–S–H
surface.

At the highest calcium concentrations, curves [Ca2+]
= 18.1 and 21.3 mM, the results are more surprising: the adsorption
increases almost linearly with polymer concentration. This behavior
may be explained by the formation of new surfaces available for adsorption
by the precipitation of Ca(OH)2 (portlandite). Indeed,
polycation adsorption is simultaneously followed by the release of
calcium ions in the bulk (see Figure 2) which, given the high initial concentrations of calcium
hydroxide, soon reach the solubility limit of the portlandite.

Figure 2 Evolution of
the bulk calcium concentration as a function of the
amount of polycations introduced. (a) Linear polycation (M̅w = 42 000 g/mol) at various initial calcium concentrations
(from 1.0 to 21.3 mM). (b) Different polycations at an initial calcium
concentration of 1.4 mM. All samples were incubated overnight at room
temperature before analysis.

A comparison of all investigated polycations at a calcium
concentration
of 1.4 mM and pH = 9.8 is presented in Figure 1b. Although the polycations show a much greater
adsorption capacity than that of small oligocations, as predicted
by MC simulations,21 the high molecular
weight linear (400 000 g/mol) and branched polycations show
significantly lower adsorption than that of smaller polycations. A
possible explanation for this is the decrease in the specific surface
available for adsorption with the degree of polymerization as a result
of the globular-like conformation of the long polymers and the aggregated
state of the C–S–H dispersions as revealed by SAXS,
see the Supporting Information (Figures S3 and S4 and Tables S1–S3).

The release of Ca2+ upon addition
of the polycation
is illustrated in Figure 2. Except for the two highest calcium concentrations, the bulk
Ca2+ concentration is observed to increase with polycation
addition, whatever the polycation, c.f. Figure 2b, and to reach a plateau, which is analogous
to the polycation isotherms, c.f. Figure 1. The near constant Ca2+ concentration
observed at the two highest Ca(OH)2 concentrations, c.f. Figure 2a, upon polycation
addition may indicate that, in these cases, the released Ca2+ precipitates with OH– to form portlandite.

Finally, one can notice that the Ca2+ release is significantly
lower in the case of the branched polycations, see Figure 2. This is explained by the
presence of carboxylate functional groups which form ion pairs with
Ca2+.3 This also results in
an increase in the adsorption affinity of these polymers with increasing
Ca2+ concentration, see Table 1.

Charge Reversal
As has been already
shown by experiments
and MC simulations, when no polymer is added, a charge reversal of
C–S–H occurs upon increasing Ca2+ concentration
and pH.13 This can happen because C–S–H
is highly negatively charged and the solution contains multivalent
counterions, here Ca2+, which accumulate in a thin layer
close to the solid surface. The ion–ion correlations have been
shown to be responsible for this phenomenon. Similarly, small oligocations
have also been observed and predicted to overcharge the C–S–H
particles at low calcium hydroxide concentration.21 From these results, one can reasonably expect that a polycation
would cause a strong charge reversal of C–S–H. This
is indeed the case, as can be seen in Figure 3. At the lowest calcium hydroxide concentration,
μe increases from −1 × 10–8, for a polyelectrolyte free solution, to +1.5 × 10–8 m2 V–1 s–1 when the
surface is saturated with polyelectrolyte (Mw = 42 000 g/mol). At the highest Ca2+ concentration,
although weakly, the electrophoretic mobility still increases with
polyelectrolyte concentration. This shows that even in these unfavorable
conditions, polycations can still compete with Ca2+ at
the C–S–H surface in agreement with the adsorption isotherms.
Also, in line with the adsorption data, the electrophoretic mobility
decreases with the degree of polymerization, see Figure 3b.

Critical Strain
The typical nonlinear oscillatory responses
(strain sweep measurements) of the C–S–H gels (G′ > G″ not shown) at
various
added amounts of polycation and calcium hydroxide concentrations are
shown in Figure 4 in
comparison to the pure C–S–H gels at ω = 1 rad/s.
At low strain, all curves show a typical plateau in the elastic modulus, G′, characteristic of the viscoelastic domain, followed
by a drop when the gel starts to yield, from which the critical strain,
γc, can be identified. Although most of the following
discussion will concentrate on γc, one can also notice
a second shoulder in the G′ = f(γ) curve as the strain increases. This second critical strain,
sometimes called the “upper critical strain”, also varies
with the polyelectrolyte and Ca(OH)2 concentrations. These
two discontinuities are also present in the G″
curves, not shown, indicating that our gels yield through two different
mechanisms. This behavior is well established for colloids in the
glass regime, that is, high volume fraction, and is attributed firstly
to bound breaking and secondly to cage breaking. More recently, this
has been observed as well in the gel region. However, its physical
origin is still a subject of debate.24−26 On the other hand, the
first yield strain can reasonably be attributed to the breakup of
the sample microstructure, and therefore to its elastic limit.

Figure 4 Strain sweep
measurements of concentrated C–S–H suspensions
(i.e., centrifugation pellets) with different concentrations of branched
polycation introduced at an initial Ca(OH)2 concentration
of (a) 1.4 mM and (b) 21.3 mM. The frequency is 1 rad/s. All tests
were carried out in the parallel plate geometry (diameter = 15 mm).

γc values are
reported in Figure 5 as a function of the amount of polycation
added at various Ca(OH)2 concentrations for the linear
and branched polycations. Without the polycations, all of the C–S–H
samples exhibit a limited elasticity, that is, small γc, similar to previously reported values on hydrated cement.27 The latter is found to increase slightly from
0.03 to 0.08% with increasing Ca(OH)2 concentration. However,
a significant gain in γc (deformation at the elastic
limit) can be found when polycations are added. The results in Figure 5 can be divided into
two distinct regions, that is the low and high Ca(OH)2 concentrations.
At the lowest Ca(OH)2 concentration, see Figure 5a–c, a sharp increase
in γc is observed, increasing up to 1 order of magnitude,
upon a small addition of polycation. γc is then found
to peak at about 1 g/L of polycation and, upon further addition (i.e.,
adsorption), drops rapidly in response to the suspension re-stabilization
induced by the strong overcharging of C–S–H particles
by the polycations. Remarkably, the same qualitative behavior is observed
for the linear and branched polymers and is, thus, not affected by
the specific structure of the polycations. The magnitude of γc, however, depends strongly on the molecular weight (# degree
of polymerization), see Figure 5a,b. That is, γc is found to increase with Mw. Furthermore, addition of the low molar mass
linear polycation, M̅w = 8500 g/mol,
does not result in any significant gain in γc (not
shown) but instead leads to fluidizing, clearly indicating that the Mw is here a critical parameter. Below, we will
argue that the observed increase in critical strain is a consequence
of a wraparound bridging mechanism characterized by the bridging of
particles or small particle aggregates with polyelectrolyte chains
coiled around two or several of them. At high Ca(OH)2 concentrations,
linear polycations have virtually no effect on γc, but when the branched polycations are used, a continuous increase
in γc with polymer concentration is observed, compare Figure 5f with Figure 5d–e. This result points
to a bridging distinct from the previous one at low Ca(OH)2 concentration and as we will show below, can be rationalized as
a surface bridging mechanism.

gels (obtained
by centrifugation) vs the amount of polycation added for the different
types of polycation and for various initial Ca(OH)2 concentrations:
(a–c) low concentrations; (d–f) high concentrations.
The frequency is 1 rad/s. All tests were carried out with the parallel
plate geometry (diameter = 15 mm).

Wraparound Bridging Mechanism
At the lowest Ca(OH)2 concentration, the sequence observed (i.e., flocculation/coagulation
at colloidal charge equivalence followed by redispersion in the presence
of an excess of polyelectrolyte) has been reported for many other
systems.28 Examples include oppositely
charged synthetic polyelectrolytes adsorbed on colloidal particles,27,29−35 surfactant micelles,36−38 and proteins, as well as complexation of DNA to latex
particles, dendrimers, and proteins.39,40 It is also
largely exploited in industry, like for example, the pulp industry.41−45 Substantial theoretical and simulation efforts have also been devoted
to such systems. On the basis of a simple electrostatic model for
the polyelectrolyte, a pearl necklace model, solved with MC simulations,
Åkesson et al. were the first to show the important attractive
contribution of the polymer connectivity to the interaction force
between surfaces.46 The attraction results
from the polyelectrolyte chains stretching between the charged surfaces,
that is, polyelectrolyte bridging, and was found to be significantly
larger than the van der Waals interaction. Granfeldt et al. applied
MC simulations to investigate the interaction between two spherical
colloids with grafted polyelectrolytes in a system where the polyelectrolytes
and particles are comparable in size.47 The width of the interaction well was found to be significantly
larger than that for a planar system. Finally, the structure and phase
behavior of many charged spherical colloid solutions with different
amounts of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes have also been investigated
using MC simulations at the level of the primitive model (PM).40,48 Although simple, the model can reproduce the qualitative trend observed
experimentally.

When a small amount of polyelectrolyte is added,
below the charge equivalence, distinct clusters are formed as a result
of bridging forces, stabilized by long-range electrostatic repulsions.
At the colloidal charge equivalence, the system becomes unstable,
and a large and loose aggregate of particles and polyelectrolytes
is formed. In an excess of polyelectrolyte, the large aggregate melts
into a mixture of individual particles and small clusters that are
sterically and electrostatically stabilized. Although in some cases
the attraction could be attributed to van der Waals forces, uncertainty
in the choice of the Hamaker constant leads to ambiguities in this
explanation. Note as well that such an argument was used to explain
surface forces measured with an atomic force microscope with a colloidal
probe setup where the size of the colloidal particles are considerably
larger than the persistent length of the polymer.34 In any case, the gain in the critical strain of 1 order
of magnitude observed here cannot be explained by a van der Waals
type of interaction.

Our results can thus be rationalized as
follows, see Figure 6. At the low Ca(OH)2 concentration, the C–S–H
particles bear a small negative
charge and form a weak gel as a result of the weak correlation force,18 giving rise to a small critical strain. The
gel consists of small aggregates of C–S–H particles
as revealed by SAXS, see Supporting Information. As polycations are added, they compete with and partially replace
the calcium counterions. At charge equivalence, a homogeneous gel
of C–S–H and polyelectrolytes is formed. The gel network
is formed by polyelectrolyte chains wrapped around different particles
and/or small clusters of C–S–H. The polymer gives rise
to a wide attractive well in the effective pair potential, which,
in turn, results in a large critical strain. When the polymer radius
of gyration to particle/cluster radius ratio is much lower than 1,
the range of the attraction is very limited and the critical strain
is dramatically reduced. Above the charge equivalence, the homogeneous
gel melts into a mixture of small clusters and individual C–S–H
particles overcharged by polyelectrolytes and the critical strain
collapses.

re-stabilization with increasing polycation concentration.

Surface Bridging Mechanism
At large
Ca(OH)2 concentration, the C–S–H particles
are highly charged,13 experience strong
ion–ion correlation
forces,18 and form a strong gel with large
and dense aggregates, as revealed by SAXS data (see Supporting Information), much larger than the radius of gyration
of the polymers. In those gels, the critical strain, thus, corresponds
to the bound breaking between these large aggregates. Considering
their size, there is no possibility of a “wraparound”
type of polymer bridging mechanism. Instead, the polymers form large
walls (aggregates) which, to a good approximation, can be considered
to be infinite and flat. The system can be described as a polyelectrolyte
solution confined between two parallel and infinite charged surfaces.
The variation in critical strain can be interpreted as a change in
the width of the well of the surface interaction free energy, Ws(h).

Ws(h) was calculated for the three different
branched polymers, namely, 5P310, 5P610, and 5P1210, and one linear polymer, 5PL using the
model described in Figure 9. The results are summarized in Figure 7. As a reference, a polymer free system with
only divalent counterions, neutralizing the surfaces, is presented.
In this case, the attraction is short ranged (around 20 Å) with
a free energy minimum at around 8 Å, arising from strong ion–ion
correlations. Replacing the ions with linear polymers (5PL) gives rise to a
somewhat longer range of attraction (≈40 Å) showing a
minimum at around h = 11 Å. In this situation,
the attraction is a mix of ion–ion correlations and bridging
attraction.49 Switching to the branched
polymers (5Pn10), the picture completely
changes, with a prominent shift in the position of the surface free
energy minimum and an extended range of attraction. In particular,
the free energy minimum lies at 40 Å due to the greater bond
length between the side chain monomers. What is more, the range and
magnitude of attraction increase from n = 3 to 12.

This surface bridging mechanism can be explained in the following
way.21,49 At large surface separation, the polyelectrolyte
chains collapse onto the surfaces, due to the strong electrostatic
attraction. Such configurations have a low entropy, but the energy
cost for the charged monomers to extend out of the surface is even
greater. As the surface separation decreases and as the monomers start
to feel the electrostatic attraction of the other surface, this energy
cost drops and is accompanied with a substantial entropy gain as the
polymer chains stretch across the confined space in between the surfaces
(the aggregates). The extent of bridging and the resulting attraction
is of course affected by the separation between the charged monomers
and the internal entropy of the polymer and is the key to understanding
the difference between the linear and branched polycations. Indeed,
with the linear polymer, independent of polymerization degree, the
most favorable case is found at a separation corresponding to the
monomer–monomer separation21,46 and is thus
rather limited. On the other hand, for the branched polymers, bridging
occurs at considerably larger separations as a result of a much greater
charged monomer–charged monomer separation and the gain in
internal entropy associated with the side chains.

This is illustrated
in Figure 7, which
shows a simulation snapshot of typical configurations
of the linear and branched polycations at a surface separation of
4 nm. As can be seen, the linear polymer lies in a flat configuration
on the surface, whereas the branched one stretches from one surface
to the other, creating a long-range bridging interaction. Finally,
recalling that the polymers compete with Ca2+ ions at the
C–S–H surface, it is quite straightforward to understand
that this competition is the main reason for the continuous increase
in the observed γc with concentration of the branched
polycations.

typical configurations of linear, 5PL (black beads), and branched, 5P610 (red beads) polycations when the distance between charged
surfaces is 4 nm. For clarity, only the neutral monomers of the branched

Conclusions
Cationic polymers were
successfully adsorbed onto negatively charged
C–S–H particles. Two different regimes can be identified
that lead to an increase in the critical strain (i.e., resilience)
through polycation adsorption:

At Low Calcium Concentration
The
negatively charged
surface exhibits a strong affinity for polycations. Under these conditions,
a small addition of polycation neutralizes the surface charge of C–S–H
(i.e., μe ≈ 0) and more importantly, increases
the critical strain by 1 order of magnitude. This effect is attributed
to a wraparound bridging mechanism, where the polymer chains wrap
around the C–S–H particles and/or small aggregates thus
forming strong C–S–H/polyelectrolyte gels. With increasing
polyelectrolyte concentration, the adsorption reaches a saturation
plateau and the gel is redispersed into C–S–H clusters
overcharged by polycations (μe ≫ 0).

At High
Calcium Concentration (Normal Cement Conditions)
C–S–H
particles form large and dense aggregates and
the critical strain of the C–S–H gels is observed to
increase only with branched polycations. In accord with MC simulations,
this result is best explained by a surface bridging mechanism, that
is, the surface bridging of large C–S–H aggregates by
polymers. Increasing the charged monomer–charged monomer separation
and internal entropy of the polymers (for the same backbone length),
that is, going from linear to branched polymers, is found to enlarge
the range of bridging attraction. This gives plenty of room to further
improve the resilience of the material by optimizing the polymer structure,
notably, the length of the charged branches.

Although there
is still a way to go, in particular with the application to the real
cement system, these results open a new route toward resilient and
tough cementitious materials.

Experimental Section
C–S–H
Suspensions Preparation
The C–S–H
mother suspensions were prepared by mixing pure calcium oxide, colloidal
silica (fumed silica AEROSIL 200), and distilled–deionized
milli-Q water. Proportions were chosen to obtain C–S–H
suspensions in equilibrium with different calcium hydroxide concentrations,
having different Ca/Si stoichiometric ratios (from 0.66 to 1.5), and
a L/S weight ratio of 50 (see Table 2). The calcium oxide powder was obtained from decarbonated
calcium carbonate in a furnace at 1000 °C for 4 h. The suspensions
were aged for 3 weeks under strong shaking conditions before use.
The Ca/Si ratio of samples was controlled directly on the solids by
alkali fusion and also by the difference between the added amount
of reactants and the remaining calcium and silicon amount in the C–S–H
equilibrium solutions. Concentrations of Ca2+ and silicate
in solution were determined by ICP-EOS. The absence of carbonation
and portlandite was controlled by DRX and by the obtained solubilities.
The used synthesis protocol, sample preparations, and analysis methods,
as well as the solubility data of C–S–H, are well established
and are detailed elsewhere.50,51

enough accuracy and are not reported.

The adsorption and electrophoretic experiments described
below
were conducted at equilibrium on samples prepared by subdividing the
mother suspensions in batches to which the desired amount of polyelectrolyte
was added. The determination of structure and mechanical properties
was performed by synchrotron-based SAXS (described in the Supporting Information) and dynamic rheology
measurements on pellets obtained after centrifugation of the equilibrated
batches.

Polyelectrolytes
Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)
linear polycations, see Figure 8a, with various molecular weight distributions were used: M̅w = 8500 g/mol from PolyScience, M̅w = 42 000 and 400 000
g/mol from Sigma-Aldrich. The molar masses were determined from the
value of the intrinsic viscosity, in 0.5 M NaCl, according to the
MHKS coefficient given by Dautzenberg et al.52 In addition, a branched copolymer with M̅w = 200 000 g/mol was also studied. This polyelectrolyte
was obtained from the polymerization of (3-acrylamidopropyl) trimethylammonium
chloride (BCQuat) with acrylic acid (weight ratio BCQuat/acrylic acid
= 8.5, i.e., molar ratio BCQuat/acrylic acid = 3). The copolymer was
synthesized and provided by Bozzetto Group, Filago, Italy. The repeating
unit of the branched polycation is shown in Figure 8b.

Various batches of pure C–S–H
suspensions with different calcium hydroxide concentrations were prepared
with a L/S ratio of 50.0 (in weight) and a volume of 10.0 mL. All
of these samples were obtained from the corresponding initial mother
C–S–H suspensions whose preparation protocol is described
above. Polycation solutions (250 μL) of different concentrations
were added to these batches. After 48 h incubation under shaking conditions
at room temperature (293 K), samples were centrifuged (9000 rpm for
15 min). The supernatants were recovered in which polyelectrolyte,
calcium, and silicate contents were measured using Total Organic Carbon
analysis (Shimadzu TOC-5000A) and inductively coupled plasma-optical
emission spectrometry (Vista Pro Varian), respectively. The adsorbed
amounts of polymer were then deduced from subtracting the remaining
content in the supernatant from the added amount in the initial suspensions.
See the SI for more details.

The
adsorption data were fitted with a Langmuir isotherm, defined as 1  where c is the equilibrium
bulk concentration, Γ is the amount of adsorbed polymer (in
milligram per gram of C–S–H), Γmax is
the maximum amount of adsorbed polymer, and K is
the Langmuir equilibrium constant (K and Γmax define the substrate surface affinity and the surface saturation,
respectively).

Electrophoretic Mobility
The electrophoretic
mobilities
of the C–S–H suspensions were determined using an electro-acoustic-based
ZetaProbe Analyzer (Colloidal Dynamics Inc., Warwick, RI). The electrophoretic
mobility was measured by successively adding a polymer solution to
250 mL of C–S–H suspension (L/S = 50). For the low molecular
mass polymer, the waiting time between polymer addition and measurement
was 1 h. In the case of the higher molecular mass polymers, a 24 h
equilibration time was needed, due to their slower adsorption kinetics.

Dynamic Rheometry
Dynamic rheometry in a strain sweep
mode was used to measure the critical strain, γc,
of the C–S–H pellets obtained after centrifugation of
the samples used in the polycation adsorption experiments. We used
a classic parallel plate geometry, modified to keep the sample in
water-saturated air. A sample consists of a disk of paste (volume
fraction around 0.04), with a diameter of 50 mm and a 2 mm gap. Given
these dimensions and the characteristics of the rheometer, the lowest
measurable strain was 0.01% (10–4). As mentioned
above, we focus our attention on γc which is, to
a great extent, independent of the particle volume fraction.53,54 The latter was thus not controlled with special care. In addition,
due to the preparation method (centrifugation), the volume fraction
is largely governed by the magnitude of the interparticle interactions
(and centrifugal speed). The dynamic elastic modulus (G′) is, on the other hand, very sensitive to the particle volume
fraction. Consequently, its variation between samples was not considered
in detail. The rheological measurements were made with a controlled
strain rheometer (AERES II Rheometric Scientific), whereby the sample
is submitted to a sinusoidal strain, and the stress response is recorded.
Details on the determination of γc can be found elsewhere.26

Model and Simulations
We did not
attempt to model the
C–S–H system in all atomic detail, but instead we aimed
at a mesoscopic model that contains the basic physical ingredients
to be able to predict the broad (qualitative) trends observed in the
interparticle forces when adding polymers. The PM of electrolyte solution
is such an alternative, wherein all ions and polyions are considered
explicitly and water is treated as a dielectric continuum, characterized
by its dielectric permittivity, ϵr = 78.5 (at room
temperature). The PM which uses a dielectric continuum for the solvent
and hardcore interactions for the finite size of the ions cannot account
for water structuring effects, dispersion interactions, polarization,
and so forth, that become important at interparticle distances corresponding
to one–two water layers, see, for example, refs (55−57). However, the PM was shown to reproduce the broad
trends found in the interparticle interactions simulated with a molecular
solvent at the Stockmayer level of description.58−60 Following our
previous studies,4,13,18,21,49 the C–S–H
dispersion is (reduced) modeled as two planar parallel surfaces, mimicking
two large C–S–H aggregates. In addition, as we are here
only interested in the qualitative trend of the interparticular forces,
particularly their range, as the calcium counterions are replaced
by polycations, we further simplified the model by assuming that (i)
the C–S–H surfaces bear a uniform surface charge density
σ set to a constant value of −320 mC/m2 and
(ii) the C–S–H surface charge is exactly compensated
by linear or branched model polymers introduced into the slit between
C–S–H surfaces and maintained constant at all surface
separations, rendering the system salt free.

Figure 9 schematically shows the system setup together with the repeating
unit of our branched polymer model, consisting of 10 freely joined
monomers. This unit is repeated n times with n equal to 3, 6, or 12. The bond length a between the monomers in the backbone was fixed to 5 Å. Each
side chain carries two monomers, separated by a fixed bond b of 10 Å, set accordingly to the branched polymer
used (BCQUAT). All monomers consist of impenetrable spheres with a
diameter of 4 Å. Furthermore, positive point charges are centered
in the outermost side chain monomers, mimicking the quaternary ammonium
groups. The carboxylate group in the backbone was treated as neutral,
due to the calcium-rich electrolyte solution, effectively neutralizing
this moiety. Linear polycations were modeled in the same manner with
freely joined positively charged monomers, separated by a fixed bond
length a of 5 Å. In the following discussion,
the nomenclature of a branched polymer according to Figure 9 will be denoted, aPnb, and the linear
polymer will be denoted aPL.

Figure 9 Sketch of the model system (left figure)
with two uniformly charged
surfaces, mimicking two C–S–H platelets, separated by
a distance h. The total charge of the polymers in
the slit matches the total surface charge. The right figure shows
the repeating unit of the polymer model for BCQuat, with positively
charged terminal side chain monomers, nomenclature aPnb.

The system described in Figure 9 was simulated with a MC method in the Canonical
ensemble
(constant number of particles, volume, and temperature), following
the Metropolis procedure.61 Further details
