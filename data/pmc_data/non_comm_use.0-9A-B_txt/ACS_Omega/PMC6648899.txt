A method
for rapid detection of metallo-β-lactamases NDM-5
and NDM-7 using conjugates of azidonaphthalimide and Zn(II) chelating
motifs (like sulfonamides, hydroxamate, and terpyridine) is described.
Incubation and irradiation, followed by gel electrophoresis, clearly
show the presence of NDMs. The o-sulfonamide-based
probe has the highest efficiency of detection for both the NDMs. The
proteins are detectable at nM concentrations, and the method is also
selective, works both in vitro and in vivo, as revealed by cellular
imaging and also with clinical isolates.

Introduction
Antibiotic resistance
has become a problem of immense concern in
today’s world because of the appearance of so called “super
bugs”.1 These super bacteria harboring
more than two antibiotic-resistant genes have become multidrug resistant,
and infections caused by them are difficult to treat.2 A major mechanism by which bacteria have acquired resistance
is through production of metallo-β-lactamases (MBL)3 which uses an active site zinc to hydrolyze the
β-lactam rings of widely used penicillins and cephalosporins
thus making them inactive.4 As a result,
carbapenems became one of the last lines of defense for treatment
of such drug resistant infections. However, the emergence of new MBL-producing
strains such as those producing New Delhi MBL (NDM BL) in recent years
is conferring resistance5 to almost all
β-lactam antibiotics including carbapenems. NDM-1 was first
identified in 2008 in a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate and has become the focus of worldwide attention because
of the rapid dissemination of the corresponding blaNDM-type
gene mainly amongst the Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp. Because of
the first description of NDM-1, multiple (>15) NDM variants have
been
reported, mostly arising from mutations causing substitutions of one
or two residues at different locations of NDM-1.6 NDM-5 differs from NDM-1 by two substitutions at positions
88 (Val → Leu) and 154 (Met → Leu),7 while NDM-7 differs at positions 130 (Asp → Asn)
and 154 (Met → Leu).8 Although the
crystal structure of NDM-1 (Figure 1) is known and not of NDM-5, it has been reported that
the mutation at position 154 is proposed for inducing higher carbapenemase
activity7,8 and/or stabilization,6d,9 which
in turn affects the discovery of new antibiotics.10 The mechanism of β-lactam resistance can be complex,
involving, expression of β-lactamases and efflux pumps, porin
loss, and alterations in penicillin-binding proteins (PBP). All these
are associated with carbapenem resistance in gram negative bacteria.11 One of the reasons12,15,16 for NDM-harboring strains becoming a worldwide
threat is certainly the lack of available antibiotics.13,14 However, the problem has become more complicated because of the
absence of a standardized phenotypic test for MBL detection. Rapid
and early detection of MBL strains including NDM producers is crucial
not only for the right treatment but also to prevent their dissemination
and associated nosocomial infections.

Results and Discussion
We became
interested in developing an early detection method for
NDM-producing micro-organisms. At present, laboratory detection of
MBL (including NDM) producers employs different techniques, all of
which depend upon assaying the carbapenemase activity,13 like for example the modified Hodge test (MHT),
UV spectrophotometry, MALDI TOF analysis, and Carba NP test. Amongst
these, MHT is the only CLSI-recommended carbapenemase-screening method
which, however, has a low sensitivity of ∼11% because of suppression
of enzyme releases due to anchoring in the inner membrane.17 The sensitivity of MHT can be improved somewhat
by the addition of a nonionic surfactant (Triton X-100).18 Other methods include PCR19 and loop-mediated isothermal amplification20 which, although more sensitive, put additional constrains
like prior sequencing of the targeted gene and primer designing.

Recently, we have reported21 an efficient
detection protocol for HCA II and PBP-5 by a simple gel electrophoresis
technique using an azidonaphthalimide template with a built-in fluorophore
and a linker. This has simplified the previously reported template-based
strategies.22 Using a similar approach,21 molecules 1–4 having Zn(II)-chelating
motifs attached to the template were designed (Figure 2) and synthesized in order to detect the
presence of NDM-5 and NDM-7, in vitro and at a cellular level. Amongst
all the probes, compound 2 with an o-sulphonamido moiety could detect the monomeric protein at ∼26
kDa with the most prominent visualizable fluorescent band under UV
after photo-cross-linking followed by gel electrophoresis. The detection
was also selective as demonstrated by preferential cross-linking of
NDMs in the presence of other zinc enzymes like HCA II, carboxypeptidase,
calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, as well as nonmetallo enzymes
like ovalbumin, class A serine-β-lactamase CTX-M-1523 and also in cell lysate (both overexpressed
and clinical isolates). Herein, we describe the synthesis of the probes
and the results of subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and microscopic studies in detail.

Figure 2 Target photoaffinity probes 1–4.

It may be pointed out that the
design of the probes was inspired
by a recent report by Cheng et al.24 on
the screening of sulfonamides as NDM-1 inhibitors. The strongest inhibitor
has been shown to be a sulfonamide with ortho-ligating imino nitrogen.
Moreover, molecular docking studies using the pdb structure of NDM-1
indicated the possibility of cation π-interaction as well as
agostic interaction between the zinc ion and the aryl ring bearing
the o-sulfonamide moiety of probe 2.
For the p-sulfonamide, being much further away from
the active site, the binding interactions are less. Interestingly
with HCA II, which is a Zn(II)-containing enzyme, the probe 2 fails to show any binding, indicating possible selectivity
of the probe (Figure 3).

Figure 3 (a) Reported24 NDM-1 inhibitor; docking
poses of probe 2 (b) with NDM-1 and (c) with HCA II.

Backed up by the initial docking
results, the synthesis started
with the previously prepared GABA-derived azidonaphthalimide carboxylic
acid 5. Like compound 1 whose synthesis
has been reported earlier, the 2-sulphonamide25 based compound 2 was similarly prepared by treating 5 with bromoacetyl sulfanilamide 6 in dimethylformamide
(DMF) in the presence of K2CO3. The synthesis
of compound 3 was accomplished from the sodium salt of 5 by reacting with bromomethyl terpyridine 7(26) in dry DMF at room temperature for 10 h. Working
up of the reaction mixture with brine followed by drying over Na2SO4 and evaporation afforded a yellow solid from
which the product was purified by repeated precipitation from acetone–hexane
(for 1 and 2) and ethyl acetate-hexane (for 3). The fluorescent template 5 was converted
to the corresponding hydroxamic acid 4 (a well-known
bidentate Zn(II)–chelator for HDAC27) by sequential reaction, first with ethyl chloroformate and N-methyl morpholine in dry DCM followed by reaction with
hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of KOH (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Synthesis of target compounds.

MBLs such as B1 subclass NDM and
BcII are present in monomeric
and, may be, dimeric forms in the solution. From the crystal structure
(Figure 1) of NDM-1,
King and Strynadka28 predicted that the
variable loops around the active site lead to broader substrate specificity
and hence higher resistance. It is also predicted that loop-10, loop-8,
and alpha-3 residues of two monomers of NDM-1 proteins interact to
form the dimer. Selevsek et al.29 have
shown that such dimers exist due to sharing of the same metal ions
between two monomeric forms of the protein where the Zn ion acts as
a bridge under low availability of Zn ions during protein folding.

The cross-linking was initially studied with purified NDM-530 under nonreducing conditions in which the protein
exists both as monomeric and dimeric forms28,29 in solution as revealed by the appearance of two distinct bands
under CBB at ∼26 and ∼50 kDa corresponding to the mono
and dimeric forms, respectively. All the probes were incubated with
both NDM-5 and NDM-7 under irradiation with UV. The appearance of
fluorescent bands visible under UV demonstrated successful cross-linking,
the cross-linking being stronger (thus more selective) with the monomeric
form as revealed by the relative fluorescent intensities of the bands
vis-à-vis Coomassie blue stained-bands (Figure 5). This observation is an indirect support
to the hypothesis28 that the Zn ions are
shared between two monomeric proteins in the dimer thus making the
metal ion less exposed. Gratifyingly, the cross-linking also works
in the case of irradiation with visible light, (the gel picture which
is included in the Supporting Information).

Figure 5 SDS-PAGE experiment31 results show the
binding efficiency of the synthesized probes with dimer and monomer
forms of purified NDM-5. NDM-5 (final concentration 10 μM) was
used for cross-linking with compound concentration kept at 20 μM.
The gel was run under nonreduced conditions. Gel image captured under
ultraviolet light has been denoted as UV and the gel image after Coomassie
blue staining has been denoted as CBB. M denotes protein molecular
weight marker.

The same experiment was
then repeated with a fixed concentration
of protein under reducing conditions to evaluate the relative efficiency
of cross-linking of various probes with the monomeric form of NDM.
In this case also, all the probe molecules showed cross-linking as
observed by the appearance of fluorescent bands when visualized under
UV after gel electrophoresis. ImageJ software analysis32 revealed that amongst all the probes, compound 2 with the o-sulfonamido group showed the
highest efficiency for visualization of NDM-5 (Figure 6) and hence subsequent experiments regarding
detection limit and cell lysate were carried out with probe 2.

Figure 6 (A) Screening of binding efficiency for synthesized fluorescent
probes with purified NDM-5; M = protein mol wt marker; C = NDM-5 in
2% DMSO. The concentration of each compound was maintained at 10 μM.
(B) ImageJ analysis of Figure 6A; the X-axis denotes the compound numbers.
SDS-PAGE was run under reduced conditions.

For a protein concentration of 20 μM, the lowest concentration
of compound 2 that can detect NDM-5 was 5 μM (figure
in Supporting Information). With a compound 2 concentration of 20 μM, the protein (NDM-5) is detectable
at as low as 500 nM concentration (Figure 7).33

1 μM NDM-5; lane 9: 0.5 μM NDM-5; lane 10: protein marker.
Final concentration of compound 2 was kept 20 μM
in each lane from lane 2–9. SDS-PAGE was run under reduced
conditions.

For checking the selectivity
of the probe molecule 2, incubation
followed by UV irradiation was performed with different additional
proteins that included other Zn-dependent enzymes like HCA II, carboxypeptidase
A, and CI phosphatase. The cross-linking efficiency of probe 2 was also compared with ovalbumin and a serine β-lactamase
CTX-M-15. The gel picture under UV vis-a-vis Coomassie stain failed
to show any significant cross-linking with all these enzymes (Figure 8). These results
demonstrated the in vitro selectivity of compound 2 towards
NDM-5. The probe 2 can also detect NDM-5 in cell lysate
where the cells have been overexpressed with the NDM-5 gene. The method
is also applicable to detect the presence of NDM-5 even in clinical
isolates. The results were also very similar in the case of NDM-7.
For example, probe 2, which selectively binds to the
NDM-7 monomer, has higher efficiency compared to other probes and
the detection limit in this case was 625 nM using 80 μM of 2 (figure in Supporting Information).

Encouraged by the in vitro results,
we then carried out in vivo
studies using fluorescence cell imaging to detect NDM-5 and NDM-7.
Upon expression of NDM-5 and NDM-7 in the Escherichia
coli host (CS109) from an expressible plasmid (pBAD18-cam)
under the control of an arabinose promoter and subsequent labeling
of the cells with compound 2 revealed that only the CS109
cells expressing NDM-5 or NDM-7 were detectable under fluorescent
microscopy (Figure 8); no fluorescence was observed in the control CS109. The CS109 cells
expressing NDM-5 as well as NDM-7 when labeled with compound 2 have clearly shown the localization of the MBL at the cell
periphery. This is most likely at the periplasmic space of the host
because the expressed NDM-5 or NDM-7 gene has the constitutive signal
peptide for transporting across the cytoplasmic membrane (see Figure 9, column 2 and 3
fluorescent images). The observation further expands the cell permeability
and precision of compound 2 in the detection of NDM-5
and NDM-7 at the cellular level.

having overexpressed SHV-14 and NDM-5 proteins bound to compound 2.

Conclusions
In summary, the overall
work provides an in-depth study on the
utility of various protein binding fluorescent compounds in detection
and localization of MBLs such as NDM-5 and NDM-7 both at the cellular
level and in vitro. Moreover, the compound 2 showed selective
binding towards both the NDMs over other proteins used in the study
as revealed by the combination of in vitro binding studies with cell
lysates and whole cell microscopy images. The method has been validated
for use against clinical isolates. Future studies will be aimed towards
other carbapenemase resistant MBLs like VIM and IMP and in vitro screening
of possible inhibitors triggered by visible light.

General Experimental Details
All reactions were performed
under a nitrogen atmosphere unless otherwise stated. Glassware used
in reactions was thoroughly oven-dried. All commercial grade reagents
were used without further purification, and solvents were dried prior
to use following the standard protocol. Thin-layer chromatography
was carried out on precoated plates (silica gel 60 F254), and the spots were visualized by exposure to UV light and/or by
staining with iodine. All crude products were purified by silica gel
flash column chromatography (230–400 mesh) with petroleum ether/ethyl
acetate as the eluent and characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry
unless otherwise mentioned. Melting points were determined in open
capillary tubes and are reported as uncorrected. 1H and 13C NMR spectra for all the compounds were recorded at 400/500/600
and 100/125/150 MHz (Bruker UltrashieldTM 400, AscendTM 500, AscendTM 600), respectively.
The spectra were recorded in deuterochloroform (CDCl3)
and deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) as solvents at room temperature. Chemical shifts are reported in
ppm from tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance as rgw internal
standard (CDCl3: δH = 7.26, δC = 77.16 ppm). Data for 1H NMR are reported as
follows: chemical shift (δ ppm), multiplicity (s = singlet,
br s = broad singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet,
dd = doublet of doublet), coupling constant (Hz), and integration.
Data for 13C NMR are reported as the chemical shift. HRMS
spectra using ESI were recorded on an ESI–FTMS mass spectrometer.

Capture
Experiment Protocol
The capture experiment
was studied with overexpressed proteins at the cellular level and
with purified proteins (in vitro) under different conditions of cross-linking
under (UV light) and reducing and nonreducing conditions. In the absence
of a reducing environment, the NDM protein exists as dimer and monomer
forms in the solution. Moreover, under reducing conditions (i.e.,
in the presence of DTT or BME in the loading dye of SDS-PAGE), a single
band of NDM protein was observed. However, under nonreducing condition,
two distinct bands were observed (26 and 50 kDa approximately). In
all the experiments purified proteins are used in the range 5–20
μM depending on the experimental requirement in 50 mM HEPES
buffer (pH 7.2), each compound was used at 20 μM concentration
(except in compound concentration study). The whole reaction was set
in 50 μL reaction volume and crossing-linking was done under
the UV light for 30 min. The image was recorded under Typhoon FLA7000,
UV light and white light conditions to confirm the compound binding
and protein stability. For more details about the buffer used and
the capture experiment protocol see Basak et al. Chem. Commun., 2017,53, 13015.

Cell lysates used at 49 μL of 0.9 OD600nm, compound
used at 20 μM concentration.

Overexpression of β-lactamase
CTX-M-15 was studied in E. coli BL21
(DE3) under the control of a T7 promoter system. E.
coli cell culture harboring recombinant CTX-M-15 was
induced with 0.2 mM of IPTG at an OD600nm–0.6 and
allowed to grow at 37 °C till OD600nm reached ∼1.0.
The cells were then harvested and resuspended in 50 mM HEPES buffer
and lysed by sonication. Prepared lysates were analyzed via 15% SDS-PAGE
for expression. Cell lysates were used at a concentration of ∼1
μg/μL with compound used at 20 μM concentration.

Similarly, clinical isolate-harboring NDM-5 was grown under antibiotic
stress (Ampicillin 200 μg/mL) till OD600nm reached
∼1.0. The cells were harvested, resuspended in 50 mM HEPES
buffer, and lysed by sonication. Reaction conditions were kept similar
to previous experiments with a final cell lysate protein concentration
of ∼1.0 μg/μL.

Protein Purification and
Compound Binding Study
The
NDM-5, NDM-7, and CTX-M-15 proteins were overexpressed in the pET28a(+)
vector under 0.5 mM IPTG induction, in BL21 (DE3) cells, at 20 °C
overnight with constant shaking. The cells were sonicated and the
cell lysate, thus obtained after removal of the cell debris, was loaded
in the AKTA prime column (HisTrapTM HP, GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden). The protein was washed initially with a low concentration
of imidazole (25 mM) and subsequently eluted with 500 mM imidazole.
Furthermore, excess imidazole was removed via dialysis and the concentration
of purified protein was checked via the Bradford method. The SDS-PAGE
analysis was done to assess the quality of purified proteins. The
purity level of proteins after dialysis was more than 95%. Afterwards,
the protein samples were used for further in vitro analysis.

Preferential
Binding of the Compound to the NDM Monomer form
than the Dimer Form
To know the preferential binding of fluorescent
compounds to NDM monomer and dimer forms, 15% SDS-PAGE was done under
nonreducing conditions. The NDM protein was used at 10 μM, the
compound was used at 20 μM. The cross-linking was done under
UV light for 30 min on ice, followed by heat denaturation (at 95 °C
for 5 min), and 15% SDS-PAGE analysis.

Microscopic Analysis of
Compound 2 Binding to Overexpressed
NDM-5 and SHV-14 in E. coli Cells
Furthermore, to know the localization of the compound in E. coli cells harboring overexpressed NDM-5, NDM-7,
and SHV-14 proteins, the bacterial cells were allowed to bind compound 2 (20 μM) for 15 min postinduction period of 16 h at
37 °C. Thereafter, the cells were allowed to stay under UV light
for 15 min for cross-linking of compound 2 with overexpressed
NDM-5, NDM-7, and SHV-14 within the E. coli cells. This step was followed by microscopy to record the images
under both phase contrast and fluorescence (using DAPI filter). The
microscopy slides were coated with 0.1% (w/v) poly-l-lysine
prior to mounting of overexpressed bacterial cells. The experiment
was also repeated with control E. coli cells devoid of NDM-5, NDM-7, and SHV-14.

It may be mentioned that the electrophoresis
were done under denatured conditions in the presence of SDS after
incubating followed by photoirradiating the probes with protein under
native conditions. The latter ensured attachment of the fluorophore
probe to the protein even if the zinc is washed away during denaturation.

Use of higher concentration of probe (80
μM) improved the detection limit down to ∼150 nM. Attempts
will be made to optimize the structural features of the probe to improve
the detection limit further.
