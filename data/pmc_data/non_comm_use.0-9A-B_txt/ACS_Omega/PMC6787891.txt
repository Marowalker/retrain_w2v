Ordered
mesoporous carbon-supported gold nanoparticles (Au/OMC)
have been fabricated in one step through a hard template method using
gold nanoparticle-intercalated mesoporous silica (GMS) to explore
two different catalytic properties, for example, electrocatalytic
oxidation of methanol and colorimetric determination of glutathione
(GSH). The catalytically inert but conducting nature of mesoporous
carbon (OMC) and promising catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) has inspired us to synthesize Au/OMC. The as-prepared Au/OMC
catalyst was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption–desorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission
electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis-elemental mapping,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The characterization results
indicate that AuNPs are uniformly distributed on the surface of OMC.
The conducting-OMC framework with a high surface area of Au/OMC provides
superior transport of electrons through the porous surface of carbon
matrix and resulted in its high efficiency and stability as an electrocatalyst
for the oxidation of methanol in comparison to CMK-3, SBA-15, and
GMS in alkaline medium. The efficiency of Au/OMC toward methanol oxidation
in alkaline medium is much higher in comparison to that in acidic
medium. The lower value of If/Ib in the acidic medium in comparison to that
in the alkaline medium clearly indicates that the oxidation process
with Au/OMC as a catalyst is much more superior in alkaline medium
with better tolerance toward the accumulation of intermediate CO species
on the active surface area. Furthermore, the Au/OMC catalyst is successfully
utilized for the detection and quantification of GSH spectrophotometrically
with a limit of detection value of 0.604 nM.

Introduction
Carbon-based materials
such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and
graphene have found a pivotal role in the field of nanotechnology
owing to their unique properties and flexibility. In the recent past,
ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) has also attracted considerable attention.
The diverse physiochemical properties of OMCs for example hydrophobicity
of their surfaces, high corrosion resistance, mechanical stability,
highly active porous surface area, large pore volume, interconnected
network of ion diffusion channels,1 good
conductivity, thermal stability, chemical inertness, easy handling,
and low cost of manufacturing2 have largely
increased the domain of their applications in the field of energy
conversion,3 chemical catalysis, biomedicine,
drug delivery,4 sensors, and solar cell
fabrication.5 Amongst different strategies
for the synthesis of OMCs, the template strategy is the most popular
method and can be classified into two major sections: hard template
approach using mesoporous silica SiO2, CaCO3, and so forth6 and soft template approach
utilizing self-assembly of the surfactant micelles to determine the
carbon shape.7 Because of better control
of the morphology of the target product, we have chosen the hard template
strategy for the one-step synthesis of ordered mesoporous carbon-supported
gold nanoparticle (Au/OMC) catalyst. So far, only few gold nanoparticle
(AuNP)-supported mesoporous carbon (Au/OMC) synthesized by the hard
template method8,9 has been reported in the literature
using a two-step process, where at first the mesoporous carbon framework
was prepared via the hard template synthetic strategy followed by
wet impregnation of the OMC framework with Au(III) and reduction of
Au(III) to Au(0). Tuel and his co-workers also reported AuNP containing
CMK-3 (AuNPs/CMK-3),10 where AuxSBA-15 was first prepared through wet impregnation
of SBA-15 with Au(III) followed by reduction to Au(0) with NaBH4, where AuNPs were grown inside the pore. Consequently, the
hard template procedure has been utilized using AuxSBA-15 to get AuNPs/CMK-3. Here in this work, we have reported
the synthesis of Au/OMC involving a one-step hard template strategy
without using any reducing agent.

In the present worldwide scenario,
the extensive consumption and
exhaustion of fossil fuels have led to develop an alternative route
to mitigate the fuel combustion and hence reduce global warming.11−15 Direct methanol fuel cell has drawn much attention as an alternative
source of power for portable and vehicular applications.16 Thus, methanol for its simplicity, versatility,
and high energy density, next to hydrogen, can be used as a source
of fuel and has thus gained much popularity for its energy conversion
efficiency along with low pollution emissions.17,18 Now to utilize it as a fuel source, the situation demands the fabrication
of an electrocatalyst which can effectively oxidize methanol. Use
of noble metals like platinum and palladium on a carbon template for
the electro-oxidation of methanol is widely exploited.19−21 However, Pt- or Pd-based catalysts often exhibit “catalyst
poisoning effects” due to the strong adsorption of CO produced
in intermediate steps.22 In order to overcome
this difficulty, gold is often used as an alternative to Pt or Pd,
and gold-based catalysts have emerged to be an active catalyst toward
oxidation reactions.23 Thus, utilizing
the versatility of mesoporous carbon materials, and keeping all the
above facts in our mind, we have synthesized a Au/OMC catalyst where
mesoporous carbon is used as a framework and the AuNPs are anchored
on the surface of OMC. The support and conducting property that OMC
provides to the AuNPs make the material stable and enhance the effectiveness
of Au/OMC to effectively catalyze the methanol oxidation reaction
(MOR) in comparison to CMK-3, SBA-15, and GMS. Thus, Au/OMC proves
that it can be used as an efficient electrocatalyst with promising
roles for different fuel cell applications in the future.

Besides
the dual effect of diverse morphology of mesoporous carbon
and catalytic features of Au, Au/OMC shows a very good peroxidase-like
activity which is further utilized for the detection of glutathione
(GSH). GSH (l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl-glycine)
is the most abundant intracellular nonprotein thiol.24 Because GSH has different vital multitasking functions
within our body like maintaining immunity, detoxification of peroxides
and free radicals (antioxidant property), and regulations of protein
function and cell growth; therefore, imbalance of GSH within our body
can cause serious health hazards like cellular damage, liver damage,
and even cancer.25 Keeping these in mind,
we have herein reported a simple colorimetric assay to detect and
quantify the amount of GSH present.

Thus in the present work,
we have successfully synthesized Au/OMC
in a one-step process, where in situ reduction of Au(III) to Au(0)
occurs without using any reducing agent thereby making it environment
friendly. The spherical Au NPs with an average size of 10 ± 0.38
nm are homogeneously dispersed on the surface of OMC. The as-prepared
Au/OMC catalyst acts as an active electrocatalyst for the oxidation
of methanol as well as the colorimetric detection of GSH in the nanomolar
range.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterizations of Au/OMC
The Au/OMC
material has been synthesized using mesoporous silica with AuNPs intercalated
inside the pore walls (GMS) as hard-template.26 However, here the synthesis of GMS involves a one-pot modified sol–gel
preparation without the use of any reducing agents. The addition of
bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]tetrasulfide (TESPTS) and HAuCl4 during the formation of SBA-15 integrates Au into the wall-framework
of SBA-15 (Scheme 1). Impregnation of as-prepared GMS with glucose as a carbon source
followed by carbonization and subsequent removal of the silica template
with hydrofluoric acid (HF) produced Au/OMC (Scheme 1). The unloaded mesoporous carbon material
(CMK-3) was also prepared using pure SBA-15.26

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Au/OMC Using AuNPs Intercalated Mesoporous Silica (GMS)
as a Hard Template
The wide-angle powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Au/OMC
is shown in Figure 1a. The presence of characteristic peaks of AuNPs in wide-angle XRD
of the Au/OMC confirms the presence of the crystalline Au phase. The
diffraction pattern matches quite well with the standard diffraction
data of the AuNPs with the face-centered cubic lattice (Fm3m space group) and cell parameter 4.078 Å
(JCPDS no. 04-0784). The XRD pattern (Figure 1a) shows distinct diffraction peaks at 2θ
= 38.53°, 44.74°, 64.9°, 77.94°, and 82.05°
corresponding to the lattice planes (111), (200), (220), (311), and
(222) of AuNPs, respectively. The broad peak appearing at 2θ
= 22.8° can be indexed to the lattice plane (002) of the mesoporous
carbon support.27 The low-angle XRD patterns
of Au/OMC and CMK-3 are displayed in Figure 1b.

Figure 1 (a) Wide-angle and (b) low angle powder XRD
patterns of Au/OMC
composite and pure OMC.

Both the samples exhibit
an intense diffraction peak for the (100)
plane which indicates the formation of an ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructure.27 Additionally, broad ill-defined less intense
superimposed peaks for (110) and (200) planes are observed for CMK-3
although these low intense peaks are not quite clear in Au/OMC.

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size
distribution determined for Au/OMC and CMK-3 are displayed in Figure 2. Both the materials
exhibited type IV adsorption–desorption isotherms (Figure 2a), which are characteristic
of mesoporous materials. A relatively high surface area and pore volume
of 770 m2 g–1 and 0.984 cm3 g–1, respectively, were observed for the unloaded
mesoporous carbon CMK-3. Whereas, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and pore volume of the as-prepared Au/OMC sample
were found to be 600 m2 g–1 and 0.5 cm3 g–1, respectively, in Au/OMC. The reduced
surface area and pore volume for Au/OMC may be attributed to the loading
of AuNPs on the surface of the mesoporous carbon matrix. The pore
size distribution plots of these samples were estimated by using the
nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) model (Figure 2b).28 A narrow pore size distribution centered around 5.0 nm was found
for both Au/OMC and CMK-3 which further indicates that the AuNPs have
been deposited on the surface of OMC.

Figure 2 Physisorption isotherms (a) and corresponding
NLDFT pore size distributions
(b) of Au/OMC and CMK-3.

The morphology of Au/OMC,
size of the AuNPs, and their dispersion
over the mesoporous carbon framework were analyzed by field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis elemental mapping.
The synthesized OMC exhibits a “noodle” like or spherical
morphology in Au/OMC which is different from CMK-3 as shown in the
FESEM image (Figure 3a). The TEM image of Au/OMC is shown in Figure 3b, where spherical AuNPs with an average
size of 10 ± 0.40 nm (Figure 3c) are seen to be evenly distributed on the surface
of the OMC. From the high-angle annular dark field-scanning electron
micrograph of Au/OMC (Figure S1), it could
be clearly observed that spherical AuNPs with the size in the range
from 5 to 14 nm are uniformly distributed on the surface of the OMC
support. Gold particles are probably capped by the C=O and
C–OH groups formed on the surface of OMC. A small portion of
the AuNPs has also grown inside the pore channels as evident from
the reduced surface area in Au/OMC than CMK-3. The SEM–EDX
(Figure S2) also clearly shows the elemental
distribution of Au NPs on the carbon framework. Besides, both SEM–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) particle mapping (Figure S3) and TEM–EDS particle mapping analysis (Figure 3d–f), demonstrates
that AuNPs are loaded as a homogeneous dispersion on mesoporous carbon.

Figure 3 (a) SEM
image, (b) TEM image, (c) Au particle size distribution,
and (d–f) TEM–EDS elemental mapping of Au/OMC.

The surface composition and electronic structure
of Au/OMC were
studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. A wide
XPS scan of the sample (Figure 4a) shows the presence of Au, C, and O. The peaks at around
284.8 and 532.1 eV in the survey spectrum clearly confirm that the
chemical components are C 1s and O 1s, respectively. The binding energies
observed were calibrated using a carbonaceous C 1s line (284.6 eV)
as a reference. A small peak corresponding to Au 4f is also observed
at 86 eV in the survey spectrum. The enlarged XPS scan of Au 4f (Figure 4b) actually shows
two peaks appearing at 84.25 and 87.90 eV which can be assigned to
Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2, respectively, thereby
indicating the presence of Au(0). Also from the enlarged C 1s spectrum
(Figure 4c), a major
characteristic peak (C–C) for a graphitic carbon framework
is observed at 284.6 eV. Besides this, a peak with reduced intensity
at a binding energy of 286.1 eV has appeared due to C–O bonds
as expected for CMK-3 type of materials.29 The broadness of the peak appeared for C–O bonds owing to
the presence of both C=O and C–OH as reported previously.29

Electrochemical Performance of Methanol Oxidation
The
MOR efficiency of Au/OMC was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV)
analysis. A comparative study for the MOR by the synthesized catalyst
along with CMK-3, GMS, and SBA-15 was performed both in acidic and
alkaline media. Figure 5 shows the cyclic voltammograms of Au/OMC, CMK-3, GMS, and SBA-15
toward the oxidation of 1 M methanol in 1 M H2SO4 at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. A pair of peaks at
0.339 V (anodic) and 0.27 V (cathodic) is observed in the cyclic voltammogram
(Figure S4) of Au/OMC in 1 M H2SO4 without methanol. The peaks observed for Au/OMC are
different from the characteristic redox peaks reported for gold-based
catalysts in acidic medium. This may be due to the very low concentration
of gold on mesoporous carbon and the conducting nature of the carbon
matrix.

Figure 5 Cyclic voltammetric responses of Au/OMC, CMK-3, GMS, and SBA-15
for electro-oxidation of 1 M methanol in 1 M H2SO4 saturated with N2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1.

For Au/OMC, the forward anodic
peak (If) at 0.755 V is due to the oxidation
of methanol whereas during the
backward scan, the peak (Ib) observed
at 0.459 V is due to the oxidation of the adsorbed CO which is generated
due to the incomplete oxidation of methanol during the forward anodic
scan.19,30 It can be noted that the peak current density
is the highest for Au/OMC catalyst in comparison to the other materials
tested. The peak current densities of Au/OMC, CMK-3, GMS, and SBA-15
in acidic and alkaline medium are given in Figure S5 (Supporting Information).

Next, MOR potentials
of Au/OMC, CMK-3, GMS, and SBA-15 were examined
and compared in 1 M aqueous NaOH solution containing 1 M methanol.
In alkaline medium, the redox process for the electro-oxidation of
methanol exhibited by Au/OMC occurs at a much lower potential than
that in the acid medium as shown in Figure 6. A pair of distinct anodic and cathodic
peaks is detected at −0.149 and −0.258 V. Because the If value is directly related to the oxidation
of methanol, the parameter (If/Ib) has much importance. The lower value of If/Ib in acidic medium
in comparison to that in the alkaline medium (Table 1) indicates that the oxidation process is
much more superior in alkaline medium with less accumulation of intermediate
CO species on the active surface area19,31 of the catalyst
and a better tolerance of Au/OMC in alkaline medium. The electrochemical
results reveal that the electro-catalytic activity of Au/OMC for MOR
is much better in the alkaline medium than that in the acidic medium
because the adsorption of hydroxyl anion or oxygen species on the
surface of gold and formation of “pre-oxidation precursors”
have a significant role in the oxidation process.32,33 Generation of the “pre-oxidation precursors” during
MOR cannot be avoided at all for any type of catalyst be it in acidic
medium or in alkaline medium.34 The MOR
requires water activation by the OHads– at the catalyst’s surface, to provide the extra oxygen atom
in order to complete the oxidation process.34 Thus, the advantage of using the alkaline medium over acidic medium
is an important factor because OH– plays a very
crucial role. MOR depends not only on the chemisorbed OH– but also strongly depends on pre-oxidation precursors.32 These pre-oxidation precursors are generated
by the reaction of OH– on the gold surface. The
surface of gold must consume enough Au–OHads(1−λ)– species (where “ads”
indicates the chemisorbed species and λ is the charge-transfer
coefficient varying between 0 and 1) to form relatively dense and
ordered gold oxides. The oxides are associated with the reactivation
of the anodic oxidation process.32 Kwon
et al. recently has shown that OH– can be formed
on gold in acidic media as well but that does not lead to any appreciable
oxidation activity like that in alkaline medium.23 The Au–O species which are produced after MOR are
again reduced to Au(0) in a backward scan, thereby generating the
active sites so that the oxidation of MeOH occurs on clean Au surfaces.
Moreover, MOR in alkaline medium occurs at a low onset potential with
less CO poisoning effects than that in acidic medium. Plausible pathways
for MOR both in acid and alkaline medium are given in Scheme S1 (Supporting Information). As shown in eq S10 (Scheme S1),
strongly adsorbed CO species is generated in acidic medium which poisons
the catalyst. Moreover, because H+ is produced during MOR
in acidic medium, the increasing acid concentration decreases the
progress of the reaction as per the La Chatelier’s principle.
Thus, it can be concluded that the reaction in alkaline medium is
more feasible than in acidic.

Electro-Oxidation
of Methanol by Au/OMC in Alkaline Medium
The most important
aspect of MOR in alkaline medium using gold
or other noble metals as an electrocatalyst is that the presence of
base makes noble metal-based catalysts active toward MOR without using
small particles or oxidic support.23 As
reported earlier, the MOR by a gold-based catalyst in alkaline medium
primarily proceeds by two independent pathways at different potential
regions. Methanol oxidizes to formates at a lower potential via a
4e– exchange mechanism as shown below32,35 1  

However, methanol is oxidized to carbonate
at a higher potential via a 6e– transfer pathway 2  

The methanol oxidation in alkaline medium by Au/OMC occurs
at a
low potential region, prior to the surface oxidation of Au/OMC, and
it starts from −0.4 V (Figure 7). The gradual increase of current in this range may
be due to the chemical adsorption of OH– on the
surface of the catalyst followed by pre-oxidation of the Au surface
layer, that is, Au–OHads(1−λ)– layer generation takes place.22,32 In this potential window,
the oxidation of both the methanol and Au surface takes place. The
current reaches its maxima at −0.149 V after which the current
diminishes gradually due to the Au oxide monolayer formation (Au–O)
for which the methanol electro-oxidation process slows down. At a
more positive potential greater than 0.2 V, an increase in the anodic
current is noted which may be interpreted as the reactivation of the
anodic oxidation process by Au–O.32 During the reverse potential scan, a cathodic peak at −0.258
V is observed. The peak may arise due to the removal of the Au–O
monolayer formed during the forward oxidation scan, as a result of
which Au–OHads(1−λ)– species are again regenerated which reinitiate the oxidation of
methanol.

Figure 7 Cyclic voltammetric responses of Au/OMC in a 1 M nitrogen-saturated
NaOH solution in aqueous medium with and without 1 M methanol at a
scan rate of 50 mV s–1.

The oxide-mediated reaction pathway in the electro-oxidation of
methanol is mediated by a six-electron process at a higher potential,
and the reaction products are carbonates as depicted in eq 3. However, Au catalysts at a lower
potential window provide different reaction pathways at which the
reaction intermediates may be further oxidized, which helps to reduce
catalyst poisoning.32 Another reason for
which Au catalysts are also considered to be highly advantageous is
their ability to reduce the poisoning of COads. The intermediate
CO formed due to the side reaction of methanol oxidation blocks the
active reaction sites of the catalysts and thereby results in poisoning
of the catalyst. Au catalysts in alkaline medium can effectively oxidize
the adsorbed CO which minimizes the poisoning effect (eq 4).20 3  

Besides this, the large porous framework of
carbon in the Au/OMC
catalyst with the Au NPs anchored on the surface of carbon provides
accessible routes for the diffusion of charge and electrolyte which
may also favor the electro-oxidation process.36 The effects of change of the scan rates during the methanol oxidation
process are shown in Figure 8a. It is clearly seen that the peak current increases with
the increase of the scan rate and the peak current linearly increases
with the square root of the scan rate (Figure 8b) which indicates that the electron transfer
is reversible in terms of the diffusion layer thickness.37

Figure 8 (a) Cyclic voltammograms of Au/OMC for the electro-oxidation
of
1 M methanol in 1 M NaOH saturated with nitrogen at variable scan
rates of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 V s–1 and (b) linear relationship between the forward anodic peak and
the square root of scan rate.

The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the Au/OMC catalyst
is determined using the following equations38 4   5  where a value of 390 μC
cm–2 has been suggested for polycrystalline gold.
As per the equations,
the ECSAAu/OMC is 3.216 cm2. This is a very
large active surface area in comparison to a bare electrode which
is only 0.1138 cm2. In comparison to this, the ECSA of
GMS is 1.572 cm2. This value also signifies the enhanced
electro-activity of Au/OMC with respect to its SBA-15 counterpart.

Electro-Oxidation Response of Other Alcohols by Au/OMC in Alkaline
Medium
Next, we examined the electro-oxidation of other alcohols
like ethanol and isopropanol. The cyclic voltammograms (Figure 9) of ethanol and isopropanol
show that Au/OMC can also catalyze electro-oxidation of these alcohols
in alkaline medium. From Figure 9, it is clearly seen that the anodic peak current is
maximum for isopropanol followed by ethanol and methanol. The highly
active porous surface area of OMC along with the homogeneous dispersion
of AuNPs provide a faster mass-transfer route which increases the
electroactivity of isopropanol despite having higher molecular mass
and low polarity.39

Figure 9 Cyclic voltammograms
of 1 M isopropanol, ethanol, and methanol
in 1 M NaOH at 50 mV scan rate.

Figure S6 (Supporting Information) shows
the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of Au/OMC measured and
compared with CMK-3 in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1000 kHz in
1 M NaOH and MeOH solution. The low-frequency range of the hemispherical
arc indicates the total resistance (the resistance of the electrolytic
solution, RS, and the resistance due to
charge transfer, RCT), whereas the high-frequency
range of the arc indicates the resistance of the solution (RS). The better capacitive property of the charge-conducting
material is governed by two main factors. One is that the value of RCT is inversely proportional to the mobility
of charge carriers and the other is that the minimum value of RS indicates that the material experiences lower
Ohmic resistance at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The
resistive parameters are listed in Table S1 in Supporting Information. It can be seen from the data that
Au/OMC has lower RS (24.77 Ω) and
lower RCT (45.07 Ω) values in comparison
to CMK-3 indicating that the charge-transfer is better in Au/OMC than
CMK-3.

The stability of the Au/OMC catalyst has been assessed
by the chronoamperometric
and repetitive cyclic voltammetric analysis for five consecutive cycles
in alkaline medium. Figure 10a depicts the chronoamperometric stability of the catalyst
from where it is clearly seen that Au/OMC attains good stability in
comparison to both CMK-3 and GMS. The slower initial decay of current
for Au/OMC in comparison to other catalysts signifies the fact that
Au/OMC has the highest tolerance to carbonaceous species, such as
CO, produced during methanol oxidation in alkaline medium. The repetitive
cycling durability in basic medium (Figure 10b) shows that the current remains almost
the same, which indicates the stability of the material during the
electro-oxidation of methanol in basic medium.

stability of Au/OMC, CMK-3, and GMS catalysts
and (b) repetitive cyclic voltammograms of Au/OMC obtained in 1 M
NaOH solution containing 1 M MeOH.

Peroxidase-like Activity of Au/OMC
The peroxidase-like
activity of Au/OMC was investigated through the catalytic oxidation
of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), a peroxidase
substrate, in the presence of H2O2 and the Au/OMC
catalyst. The catalytic reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically
at room temperature from the increase of absorbance intensity of a
peak generated at 653 nm. During the reaction, due to oxidation of
TMB in the presence of peroxide and the catalyst, the color change
from colorless to blue is visible with the generation of the peak
at 653 nm. The phenomenon shows that Au/OMC in the presence of peroxide,
mimic the peroxidase-like activity as shown by horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) enzyme.40 The highest absorbance
at 653 nm is observed for the reaction where all three components—Au/OMC,
H2O2, and TMB are present in the system. Controlled
experiments with TMB–H2O2 showed that
the absorbance at 653 nm is substantially lower than the Au/OMC–TMB–H2O2 system within the same period of time, and Au/OMC–TMB
had the least absorbance at 653 nm (Figure 11). The observations indicate that for the
highest catalytic activity, the presence of Au/OMC, H2O2, and TMB is very important. It is also evident from Figure 11 that Au/OMC exhibited
better activity than both CMK-3 and GMS. Temperature and pH also play
a vital role in the peroxidase activity. The oxidation of TMB in the
presence of H2O2 and the catalyst is strongly
dependent on pH, as shown in Scheme S2 (Supporting Information).41,42 As shown in Figure S7, the blue color of the oxidized TMB was generated
only at pH 4.0. At a pH lower than 4.0, a yellow color (Figure S7) is observed due to the formation of
diimine species (Scheme S2), whereas at
higher pH no color change is observed. The temperature also plays
a vital role during the generation of the charge-transfer complex
(Scheme S2), which is blue in color. Moreover,
during the oxidation, a catalyst–substrate complex formed and
the formation depends on the temperature. The standardization of this
catalysis at pH range 2–7 and temperature range 20–60
°C shows that the highest activity is shown at pH 4 and temperature
40 °C (Figure S8, Supporting Information).

Figure 11 Plot of absorbance at 653 nm vs time for the oxidation of TMB at
different conditions at pH 4 (acetate buffer).

Steady State Kinetic Response of the Au/OMC Catalyst
The
quantification of the peroxidase-like activity of Au/OMC, in
comparison to HRP, is analyzed by steady-state kinetics for the oxidation
of TMB and H2O2 by varying the concentrations
of either of the substrates and keeping the concentration of others
constant (Figure 12). The important kinetic parameters like Km (Michaelis–Menten constant) and Vmax (maximum rate of conversion) are obtained by plotting V0 against S0 from steady-state
kinetics and fitting with the Michaelis–Menten equation. The
double reciprocal Lineweaver–Burk plot is obtained by plotting
1/V0 against 1/S0. The binding affinity between the substrate and the enzyme
is evaluated from Km. Smaller the Km value, higher will be the enzyme affinity
for its substrate, and the parameter Vmax directly measures the enzymatic catalytic activity.43,44 The calculated values of Km and Vmax are given in Table 2. From the data tabulated in Table 2 it is seen that the Km values of Au/OMC with either peroxide or TMB
as the substrate is very much lower than that of natural enzyme HRP
indicating a much higher affinity of Au/OMC than HRP toward the substrates.
Thus, there is a clear indication that Au/OMC can be considered as
an excellent peroxidase mimicking enzyme.

The peroxidase-like activity
of Au/OMC can also be conducted with ortho-phenylenediamine
(OPD) as a peroxidase substrate in
addition to TMB by monitoring a gradual change in absorbance at 448
nm. The peak at 448 nm is developed during the reaction of OPD with
H2O2 in the presence of the catalyst with a
visible change in color from colorless to yellowish-orange (Figure 13).

Figure 13 Absorbance spectra and
visual change in color of TMB and OPD with
the generation of peaks at 653 and 448 nm, respectively, upon reaction
with peroxide in the presence of Au/OMC catalyst.

It is assumed that the OH• radical generated
because of the catalytic decomposition of H2O2 catalyzed by the nanoenzyme, oxidizes the substrate as shown in
the case of the Fenton Haber–Weiss reaction occurring in biological
cells.48 To prove the generation of the
OH• radical, a simple experiment has been performed
using terephthalic acid (TPA) as a fluorescent probe. TPA can selectively
capture the OH• radical generated and forms 2-hydroxyterephthalic
acid which is a highly fluorescent moiety with an emission peak at
439 nm.49 The generation of an emission
peak at 439 nm (Figure 14) with a gradual increase in peak intensity with time in the
presence of Au/OMC and H2O2 clearly clarifies
that OH• radicals are generated in the course of
the reaction due to the decomposition of peroxide and that Au/OMC
mimics peroxidase-like activity following the Fenton Haber–Weiss
reaction model.

of
TPA, H2O2, and Au/OMC are, respectively, 0.5
mM, 0.01 M, and 10 μg.

Spectrophotometric Detection and Estimation of GSH Using the
Au/OMC Catalyst
Utilizing peroxidase-like activity of Au/OMC,
a simple colorimetric assay has been developed for the detection of
GSH. A visible chromogenic transition from blue to colorless is observed
when a specific amount of GSH has been spiked in the TMB, H2O2, and Au/OMC system and this can be utilized to detect
and quantify the amount of GSH present in a sample. With the gradual
increase in the concentration of GSH from 0 to 300 μM, the blue
color of oxidized TMB gradually fades out with a simultaneous decrease
in absorbance at 653 nm and ultimately becomes colorless (Figure 15a).The reason for
this visible change in color may be attributed to the second ongoing
redox cycle where GSH is oxidized to glutathione disulphide with the
simultaneous reduction of oxidized TMB (Scheme 2).

a decrease in absorbance
with the addition of GSH to the TMB–H2O2–Au/OMC system in the presence of acetate buffer with inset
showing the visible color change from blue to colorless on adding
GSH and (b) the relationship between absorbance and concentrations
of GSH showing linearity from 0 to 80 μM with R2 = 0.982.

Scheme 2 Schematic Representation
for the Oxidation of TMB in the Presence
of Au/OMC and H2O2 with the Corresponding Oxidation
of GSH
A good linear relationship
is maintained between absorbance and
concentration within the concentration range 0–80 μM
with a correlation coefficient (R2) 0.982
(Figure 15b). The
limit of detection (LOD) is calculated to be 0.604 nM. The selectivity
for the spectrophotometric detection of GSH is analyzed by adding
Gly, Ala, Val, Pro, Cys, and GSH to the TMB–H2O2–Au/OMC system under similar conditions. The ΔA value at 653 nm is highest for GSH compared to others
(Figure 16). This
infers a good selectivity of the GSH assay with the developed sensor.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have reported a hard template method for the synthesis
of the Au/OMC catalyst from the AuNP-intercalated mesoporous silica
(GMS) in one step without using any reducing agent. AuNPs of size
approximately 10 nm are anchored on the surface of the porous carbon
template of the catalyst without affecting the pore diameter of the
OMC support. The Au/OMC catalyst proves to be a much more superior
catalyst in comparison to bare mesoporous carbon CMK-3, SBA-15, and
GMS for the electrochemical oxidation of methanol. The reduced Ohmic
resistance at the electrode–electrolyte interface and resistance
due to charge transfer, better stability of the material, small particle
size, and highly porous surface area with a uniform distribution of
AuNPs make Au/OMC an excellent catalyst in comparison to the three
others for the MOR process. Besides, Au/OMC also exhibited a very
good peroxidase-like activity and oxidizes TMB with a visible change
in color at pH 4 which is monitored spectrophotometrically at 653
nm. Subsequently, we have also utilized Au/OMC successfully to detect
GSH within a linear concentration range from 0 to 80 μM with
a LOD of 0.604 nM.

Experimental Section
Materials
Pluronic
P123, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS),
TESPTS, gold chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), sucrose, HF (40%), TMB, and H2O2 were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals and solvents were purchased
from a commercial source available locally and were used without further
purification. The GMS precursor was synthesized by slightly modifying
the method reported previously by Richards and co-workers.26

Synthesis of the Precursor Mesoporous GMS
Template
Pluronic P123 (2.5 g) was dissolved in 94 mL of
2 M HCl in a round-bottomed
flask at 318 K. Subsequently, a mixture of 5.57 mL of TEOS (25 mmol)
and 0.5 mL TESPTS (1 mmol) was slowly added under stirring. Then,
aqueous solution of HAuCl4·3H2O (0.4 g,
1 mmol) was added dropwise. The solution was stirred for 24 h at a
temperature of 313 K and aged for 72 h at 373 K without stirring.
The precipitated solid was filtered off and washed with water thrice
followed by ethanol. The resulting solid was dried at 373 K for 24
h and calcined at 773 K for 5 h.

Synthesis of Au/OMC
of GMS (0.5 g) was impregnated
with a solution of 0.625 g of sucrose in 2.5 g of H2O and
0.07 g of H2SO4. The mixture has been kept in
an oven and the temperature was maintained at 373 K for 6 h and then
at 433 K for another 6 h. The black powder thus obtained was impregnated
again with a solution of 0.175 g sucrose in 5 g of H2O
and 0.07 g of H2SO4 and kept in an oven similarly
at 373 and 433 K. Finally, the solid obtained was carbonized in a
tube furnace at 1173 K for 5 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. To remove
the silica framework completely, the carbonized product was kept overnight
in 10 wt % HF at room temperature and then centrifuged and washed
with ethanol. Au/OMC obtained was dried overnight at 393 K in an oven.

Physical Measurements
Powder XRD was analyzed using
a Philips PW 1140 parallel beam X-ray diffractometer with monochromatic
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540598 Å) operated at 40 kV
and 40 mA using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with
a step size 0.008 and a scanning rate of 0.02 s–1 in the 2θ range of 10°–100°. FESEM analysis
was performed using a JEOL JSM 7610F instrument using an accelerating
voltage of 15 kV. FESEM–EDS analysis and particle mapping were
performed in the same SEM instrument equipped with an Oxford Instruments
X-MaxN50 X-ray detector. TEM and TEM–EDS analysis,
particle mapping, and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)
dark field images of the catalyst were recorded using a JEOL 2100
TEM instrument operating at 200 kV. The elemental composition of the
catalyst was determined by XPS measurements using a PHI 5000 Versa
Prob II, FEI Inc. instrument. N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms were performed using a NOVA 2200e surface area and pore
size analyzer. The specific surface areas were calculated by the BET
method, and the pore size distributions were calculated by the NLDFT
method. The samples were degassed under a nitrogen flow at 373 K for
6 h to remove impurities adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst prior
to the sorption experiment. A photoluminescent study was performed
in a HORIBA Fluorolog spectroflurometer. UV–vis spectra and
kinetic studies were performed in a Agilent 8453 diode array spectrophotometer.

Electrochemical Studies
The electrochemical performances
for electro-oxidation of methanol using the Au/OMC catalyst were studied
by cyclic voltammetry at room temperature (25 °C) using a electrochemical
analyzer CH Instrument CHI700E electrochemical workstation. A conventional
three-electrode system was set up using glassy carbon (GC) as the
working electrode, Ag/AgCl (satd. KCl) as the reference electrode,
and Pt wire as the counter electrode. The GC electrode was cleansed
thoroughly by 0.05 μm of alumina powder slurry followed by rinsing
in distilled water and acetone and then dried in air. The Au/OMC sample
solution prepared with 5 mg of catalyst in 10% Nafion solution was
dropcasted on the GC electrode and then dried in air to use it as
the working electrode. For a comparative study, the electro-oxidation
of methanol was performed using the Au/OMC, CMK-3, GMS, and SBA-15
both in acidic and alkaline medium at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1.

Peroxidase-like Activity of Au/OMC
The peroxidase-like
activity of the Au/OMC composite was investigated using TMB as the
peroxidase substrate in acetate buffer solution in the presence of
H2O2. For this, 2.4 μL of TMB (0.125 M
stock solution TMB dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) was treated with
4 μL of 30% H2O2 in the presence of 10
μg of the Au/OMC catalyst in acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.0).
The color change of the solutions was monitored spectrophotometrically
in time-scan mode at 653 nm. The kinetic analysis with TMB as the
substrate was performed with a fixed concentration of H2O2 (13 mM) and varying the concentration of TMB (4.16,
10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 100.0, 125.0, and 156 μM) in the presence
of 10 μg of Au/OMC catalyst. Similarly, the kinetic analysis
with H2O2 as the substrate was performed using
the same amount of catalyst with a fixed concentration of TMB (100
μM) and varying concentration of H2O2 (0,
13, 19.5, 26.1, 32.6, 39.1, 48.9, 58.7, 68.5, and 81.5 mM). Kinetic
parameters were calculated based on Michaelis–Menten eq 6. 6  V0, Vmax, [S], and Km represent
the rate of conversion achieved by the reaction, maximum rate of conversion,
the concentration of the substrates, and Michaelis–Menten constant,
respectively.

Spectrophotometric Detection of GSH by Au/OMC
Based on Its Peroxidase-like
Activity
For the colorimetric assay of GSH, a series of solutions
each with 13 mM H2O2, 10 μL of a 6.25
mM solution of TMB, 10 μg of the Au/OMC catalyst, and 3 mL of
acetate buffer were prepared at room temperature. The solutions were
incubated at 40 °C for 10 min. To each solution, GSH is added
at different strengths varying from (0–300 μM) and change
in absorbance at 653 nm was monitored spectrophotometrically.

Study
of Photoluminescence with TPA
In order to prove
the generation of the OH• radical, photoluminescence
(PL) spectra were studied using TPA as a fluorescent probing agent.
0.5 mM TPA, 10 mM H2O2, 10 μg of the Au/OMC
catalyst were incubated in 20 mL of acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and stirred
well. The PL spectra of the solution were measured at an interval
of 15 min after centrifugation and intensity of the emission peak
produced at 439 nm (λex = 315 nm) due to OH• radical generation was monitored.
