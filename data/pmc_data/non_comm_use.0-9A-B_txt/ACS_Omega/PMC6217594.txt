The difficulty of developing an efficient
malaria vaccine along
with increasing spread of multidrug resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum to the available antimalarial
drugs poses the need to discover safe and efficacious antimalarial
drugs to control malaria. An alternative strategy is to synthesize
compounds possessing structures similar to the active natural products
or marketed drugs. Several biologically active natural products and
drugs contain β-carboline moiety. In the present study, few
selected β-carboline derivatives have been synthesized and tested
for their in vitro and in vivo antiplasmodial activity against the
rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei (NK-65). The designed analogs exhibited considerable in vitro antimalarial
activity. Two compounds (1R,3S)-methyl
1-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole-3-carboxylate (9a) and (1R,3S)-methyl 1-(pyridin-3-yl)-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole-3-carboxylate (9b) were further selected for in vivo studies. Both the lead
compounds (9a and 9b) were observed to be
safe for oral administration. The therapeutic effective dose (ED50) for 9a and 9b were determined
and in the animal model, 9a (at 50 mg/kg dose) exhibited
better activity in terms of parasite clearance and enhancement of
host survival. Biochemical investigations also point toward the safety
of the compound to the hepatic and renal functions of the rodent host.
Further studies are underway to explore its activity alone as well
as in combination therapy with artesunate against the human malaria
parasite P. falciparum.

1 Introduction
Despite
many efforts, malaria is one of the most significant infectious
diseases, characterized by an intrinsic ability to acquire resistance
against drugs. As per the World Malaria Report 2017, there were 216
million cases and 445 000 deaths from the disease globally in 2016
with Plasmodium falciparum, accounting
for maximum (99%) cases of malaria in the African region.1 For malaria control, multifaceted approaches
with a wide range of effective tools such as vector control, vaccines,
and chemotherapy have been used worldwide. The antimalarial drug chloroquine
(CQ) played a very significant role in controlling of malaria till
the development of resistant strains of the parasite. The absence
of an effective malaria vaccine, mutation in the vector, and resistance
of the parasite to the available antimalarial drugs urge the need
to look for newer approaches to combat the disease. An alternative
strategy is to synthesize compounds possessing structures similar
to the active natural products or marketed drugs.

1,2,3,4-Tetrahydro-β-carbolines
(THβC’s) possess
a wide range of biological activities and constantly studied for their
use in novel pharmacological applications.2,3 THβC
is a privileged structure present in several drugs currently available
in the market as well as observed in many drug candidates under the
development. Many pharmacologically interesting compounds comprise
THβC scaffold4−9 and also represent an important moiety for the discovery of potent
antimalarial drugs.10 Among the natural
products, manzamine A, a β-carboline alkaloid isolated from
marine sponge in 1986, demonstrated potent antiplasmodial activity
both in vitro and in vivo.11 Whereas, moderate
antimalarial activity in alkyl guanidine-substituted β-carboline
derivatives was observed by Chan et al.6 The synthetically and biologically interesting subgroup among the
THβC’s is the optically active C1–C3-substituted
THβC’s.

NITD609 1 (also named cipargamin),
a C1–C3
substituted THβC analogue (Figure 1), was identified using high-throughput screening
as a new class of potent and orally efficacious compound for the treatment
of malaria and is currently undergoing phase II clinical trial.12,13 This compound is known to act against P. falciparum with a mechanism distinct from that of the existing antimalarial
drugs.14

Figure 1 C1–C3-substituted THβC’s
as the antimalarial
agent.

Similarly, MMV008138 2, a C1–C3 substituted
THβC analogue, having potent antimalarial activity (showing
>95% growth inhibition at 5 μM), was discovered during both
in vivo and in vitro screening of 400 compounds within the malaria
box and exhibited >60% rescue following the addition of 200 μM
isopentenyl pyrophosphate.15 During this
investigation, Yao et al. reported in vitro structure–activity
relationship (SAR) studies of 2 and revealed that 1R,3S-stereochemistry
at C1–C3 position is important for better potency and improved
growth inhibition. Later, by more studies they found that the active
compound specifically targets the enzyme 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (PfIspD) in the MEP pathway.16 Another C1–C3-substituted
THβC showing potent antimalarial activity is C1-piperonyl derivative 3 (discovered by SAR studies of tadalafil derivative on P. falciparum strain),17 C1-thiophene derivative 4,16 C1-pyridine derivative 5,18 and THβC–quinoline conjugate 6.8 It is noteworthy to mention that only the lead
compounds 1 and 2 were investigated to show
their in vivo efficacy in animal models, whereas none of the other
active THβC antimalarials were further investigated in vivo.

On the basis of this systematic literature survey and the antimalarial
activity of the known THβC’s, a small library of C1-pyridyl,
thiophene, and piperonyl-substituted THβC’s were synthesized
from methyl ester derivative of l-tryptophan (an essential
amino acid) using classic Pictet–Spengler reaction. Both cis-
and trans-isomers of C1, C3-substituted THβC’s as well
as fully aromatic β-carboline analogue were synthesized to check
the effect of stereochemistry at C1 position on the biological activity.
In addition, both cis and trans, C1 n-hexyl derivatives
were synthesized and evaluated for their antimalarial activity against
murine malaria. In vitro antiplasmodial activity of these derivatives
was assessed against Plasmodium berghei by WHO method based on schizont maturation inhibition. The combination
of lead THβC with commercially available drug leucovorin (10
mg/kg) has also been tested in vivo. The limit test of Lorke was used
to assess the acute toxicity of the compounds. In vivo suppressive
activity against P. berghei was assessed
and the ED50 (effective dose) and therapeutic index were
also calculated. Furthermore, the biochemical assays were performed
to monitor the hepatic and renal toxicity.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Design and Chemistry
The THβC
scaffold is found in a wide range of natural products with interesting
biological properties and attracted great attention of synthetic chemist
for many years. In vitro SAR studies available on THβC’s
shown in Figure 1 clearly
demonstrated the importance of 1R,3S-stereochemistry in this scaffold
for the antimalarial activity.15,16 It was also evident
that the C1 aromatic substituents improve the activity, whereas incorporation
of aliphatic substituents at this position abrogates the antimalarial
property. The presence of carbonyl group at C3 position was also found
to be important for the enhancement of activity.16

On the basis of the lack of in vivo data on this
scaffold and to study the effect of stereochemistry as well as substituents
at C1 and C3 position of THβC’s and to investigate this
scaffold in combination therapy for malaria, we synthesized a set
of eight THβC derivatives including both cis- and trans-isomers
by reaction between methyl ester derivative of l-tryptophan
and aldehydes containing medicinally important heterocyclic rings
such as benzo[1,3]dioxole (8a and 9a), pyridine
(8b and 9b) and thiophene (8c and 9c) rings. The selected heterocycles are privileged
structures and found in several drugs such as tadalafil, niacin, clopidogrel,
and many more.19,20 Additional aliphatic hydrocarbon
chain-substituted THβC’s (8d and 9d) were also synthesized to confirm the exact requirement of C1 aromatic
substitution for the desired antimalarial activity (Scheme 1).

THβC Derivatives (i)

(1.2 equiv), Isopropanol, Reflux, 8 h
The most efficient and short route for the synthesis of
this scaffold
is stereoselective Pictet–Spengler reaction. Alternatively,
the Bischler–Napieralski reaction to give 3,4-dihydro β-carboline
followed by reduction to THβC is also possible. To synthesize
C1–C3 substituted optically active THβC derivatives, l-tryptophan was treated with freshly distilled trimethyl silyl
chloride in dry methanol at room temperature (RT), which furnished
methyl ester derivative in 90% yield.21 Thionylchloride with methanol in refluxing condition also produced
the desired product in 95% yield.22 Having
synthesized a methyl ester derivative, the next target was to synthesize
both cis- and trans-isomers of THβC derivatives in equal ratio
and good yield for the ease of purification. In the Pictet–Spengler
reaction, the cis product is predominantly formed under kinetically
controlled conditions and selectivity switch toward trans-isomer under
thermodynamically controlled conditions. The nature of reagents and
temperature has a dramatic effect on kinetic and thermodynamic control
of the reaction. When the reaction was executed in most commonly used
reaction condition [trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and dry dichloromethane
(DCM) at 0 °C to RT], formation of both isomers of THβC
(cis/trans, 80:20) was observed but the starting material was not
completely consumed even after addition of excess amount of TFA and
long reaction time. The overall yield of this reaction was also observed
to be very poor. This investigation resulted in the isolation of desired
product, and interestingly, it was found that the retention factor
for the trans-isomer on thin layer chromatography (TLC) was less as
compared to that of cis-isomers. The high mobility of cis-isomer was
attributed to the low absorptivity of cis-isomer on the silica gel
as a result of steric inaccessibility of polar groups.23 In 1H NMR, proton at C1 position
of the trans-isomer was showing downfield signal as compared to that
of cis-isomer.24 In an another attempt,
the use of 10% TFA in water did not produce any product in this reaction,25 whereas Et3N in DCM resulted in the
formation of only a trace amount of the product.26 The reaction carried out using nitromethane/toluene was
good in yield (70%) but resulted in the formation of cis-isomer as
a major product (cis/trans ratio was 95:5). Finally, the reaction
performed in isopropanol solvent under refluxing condition27 resulted in the formation of desired product
in about 85% yield with approximately equal amounts of both the isomers
(cis/trans, 40:60). All the Pictet–Spengler reactions were
carried out using this method.28 Fully
aromatized β carboline derivative 10 was synthesized
by reaction of compound 9a with a catalytic amount of
iodine (20 mol %) at 150 °C for 6 h in dimethylformamide (DMF)
(Scheme 2).29

The column chromatographic purification of all
the compounds was
performed using 230–400 mesh silica gel to isolate the pure
isomers, which were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques,
and the purity was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (HPLC–MS).

2.2 In Vitro
Antiplasmodial Efficacy against P. berghei
The compounds were tested for
their potential to inhibit P. berghei schizont maturation in vitro. The majority of compounds exhibited
significant inhibitory activity against the parasite with IC50 < 5 μg/mL. The standard drug CQ (10 μM) exhibited
90.66 ± 0.48% inhibition, whereas leucovorin (L, 5 μg/mL)
exhibited 70.91 ± 2.16% inhibition. The compounds 9a (5 μg/mL) and 9b (5 μg/mL) exhibited 71.79
± 8.77 and 86.17 ± 13.9% inhibition of P.
berghei schizont maturation, respectively (Figure 2). According to the
WHO recommendations and other studies, synthetic chemicals/drugs are
classified as highly active antimalarials having IC50 values
of <5 μg/mL. The promising antimalarials demonstrate activity
in the range of 5–15 μg/mL, whereas the compounds with
IC50 of 15–50 μg/mL are described as moderately
active antimalarials.30 Thus, all the compounds
were categorized as highly active against the CQ-sensitive (NK-65)
strain of rodent malaria parasite P. berghei. On the basis of these results, two compounds 9a and 9b were selected for assessment of antimalarial activity in
vivo using rodent malaria model.

Rodent-infecting Plasmodium species are recognized as valuable experimental
models to study various aspects of mammalian malaria,31 such as their developmental biology, interactions between
the parasite and its host, development of vaccines, and testing of
novel drug candidates. This is because of their conserved genome organization,
basic biology, house-keeping genes, and biochemical processes, as
well as similar characteristic patterns of drug-sensitivity and resistance.
Also, techniques are available for their genetic modification and
their life-cycle stages can be easily manipulated.32 Rodent malaria parasites are very easy to maintain in vitro
in cultures and in vivo in laboratory animals. P. berghei is also considered a useful model for studying Plasmodium
vivax infection and alternative forms of CQ resistance.33,34

showing the effect of β carboline derivatives (5 μg/mL)
on schizont maturation of P. berghei in vitro. The standard drug CQ (10 μM) exhibited 90.66 ±
0.48% inhibition, whereas leucovorin (L, 5 μg/mL) exhibited
70.91 ± 2.16% inhibition.

2.3 Acute Toxicity
The safety of any
compound exhibiting good antiplasmodial activity is a major concern
during antimalarial drug development. The compounds were evaluated
for their in vivo acute toxicity using the limit test of Lorke, which
is the standard test for evaluation of acute toxicity of any compound/drug.35 Mortality of mice was evident at a dose of 5
g/kg, which is the highest testing dose limit for any drug/compound
in rodents. At 4 g/kg of 9a and 2.5 g/kg of 9b, all the mice survived longer than the specified 14 day test duration,
which illustrated the safety of these compounds at these doses. No
behavioral changes were observed within 2 h of 9b administration.
However, abdominal contractions respiratory problems and swelling
in the hind foot were observed in mice after administration of 9a. All these side effects disappeared within 2 weeks of dose
administration. On the basis of these dose values and in vitro activity
data, two different concentrations (50 and 100 mg/kg) were selected
for in vivo suppressive activity of 9a and 9b against P. berghei.

2.4 In Vivo Suppressive Activity against P. berghei
Compound 9a (50
mg/kg) in monotherapy (G4) and its combination with leucovorin (G7)
exhibited considerable chemotherapeutic activity in vivo with 62.9
and 63.97% chemosuppression, respectively (Table 1). The ED50 of the compound was
determined to be <50 mg/kg. The therapeutic index was determined
to be >80. Combination of 9a with leucovorin also
showed
considerable activity (ED50 < 50 mg/kg) against the
parasite in vivo. The % parasitaemia was observed to decline in all 9a-treated groups by day 28 post inoculation. Very low infection
of 2.43 ± 0.51% (G4), 0.73 ± 0% (G5), and 3 ± 1% (G7)
were recorded in the surviving mice on day 28. Mean survival time
(MST) of 23.4 ± 6.54 days was recorded at 50 mg/kg of the compound 9a (Figure 3), which was extremely statistically significant as compared to the
infected control (8.2 ± 0.83 days) (Figure 4). Leucovorin (10 mg/kg) and CQ (10 mg/kg)
exhibited MST of 15.75 ± 10.68 and 28 ± 0 days, respectively.
Behavioral changes such as lethargy and reduction in locomotion were
not evident at 50 mg/kg of the compound and in the combination therapy-treated
mice (Table 2). Some
physical signs of illness were seen at higher dose (100 mg/kg).

Compound 9b-treated
groups, G8 (50 mg/kg) and G9 (100
mg/kg), recorded dose-dependent suppressive activity against P. berghei infection with 49.02 and 70.32% chemosuppression,
respectively, on day 5. The ED50 of the compound was calculated
to be =51.8 mg/kg. The therapeutic index was determined to be =48.26.
However, all the mice in both groups died by day 14 post-inoculation
recording a MST of 10 ± 3.31 and 13.6 ± 5.85 days, respectively
(Figure 3). Mice treated
with the standard drug CQ exhibited a MST of 28 ± 0 days (Figure 4). No behavioral
changes were observed in 9b-treated groups at a dose
of 100 mg/kg (Table 2).

The results of in vivo suppressive activity have been classified
in accordance with the classification given by Muñoz et al.,
which categorizes antiplasmodial activity of a plant extract/synthetic
compounds as very good, good, moderate, and inactive if it displays
a percent inhibition equal to or more than 50% at concentration of
100, 250 mg/kg, between 500–1000, and above 1000 mg/kg, respectively.36 On the basis of this classification, both 9a and 9b can be categorized as very good antimalarials.
However, the compound 9a exhibited better in vivo activity
in terms of parasite clearance and enhancement of the MST of the rodent
host at 50 mg/kg. The mortality of rodent host at higher concentration
(100 mg/kg) can be due to the high drug pressure in the infected condition.
The mice were observed to be anemic with decreased body weight. Infection
was seen primarily in reticulocytes. The changes in the behavioral
patterns were not much evident in the 9a-treated mice
as compared to the negative control indicative of suppression of parasite
development. In the negative control, these symptoms were evident
due to anemia and reticulocytosis.

It is not necessary that
compounds exhibiting good inhibition of
parasite in vitro would always be active in rodent models.37 The compound 9b showing better
inhibition of parasite in vitro did not show promising results in
vivo suggesting a specific role of C1 pyridine-functionalized THβC
in the observed toxicity. The drug leucovorin is a reduced form of
folic acid. It is readily converted to other reduced folic acid derivatives
and is known to increase the bioavailability of compound/drug. The
combination of 9a with leucovorin also exhibited very
good antiplasmodial efficacy with very low parasitaemia levels in
surviving mice on day 28. Such findings illustrate the potential of
this combination as an effective antimalarial.

2.5 Biochemical
Assays
Many enzymes act
as markers of disease states and their levels in the intracellular
fluids are used in the diagnosis of diseases. Serum levels of alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT),
serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), and bilirubin levels
are used as biomarkers of hepatic function, whereas urea and creatinine
are used for evaluation of renal function.

2.5.1 Liver
Function Tests
Impairment
of normal hepatic function is most commonly observed in malaria infection.
Significant elevations in the serum level of liver enzymes such as
SGOT, SGPT, and ALP are observed in malaria infection.38 One of the factors responsible for impairment
of liver function in acute malaria infection is centrilobular liver
damage, which results in hyper bilirubinaemia.39 The results of the present study are consistent with these
reports as significantly (p < 0.0005) elevated
ALP, SGOT, SGPT, and bilirubin levels were observed in the infected
control (G2) as compared to normal mice. In 9a-treated
mice (G4–G8), serum ALP activity and bilirubin level were significantly
(p < 0.0005) lower than the infected control on
day 10 (Table 3). Slight
increase in the bilirubin level (p < 0.05) was
evident among the mice treated with 9b (G8, G9) on day
10 (Table 2). In the
surviving mice of 9a and 9a + L-treated
groups, a decrease in ALP and bilirubin levels was observed on day
28 post-inoculation. However, a slight increase in bilirubin levels
was seen in surviving mice of combination therapy group (G7) on day
28.

SD for five mice per group as compared to infected control. p-Value in comparison to infected control is shown as ***p < 0.0005, extremely statistically significant; **p < 0.005, very statistically significant; *p < 0.05, statistically significant; and #p > 0.05, not statistically significant.

Activity of serum SGOT was significantly lower than
the infected
control on day 10 in 9a (p < 0.005)
and its combination therapy (p < 0.05)-treated
groups. However, a slight increase in SGOT activity was evident at
the higher dose (100 mg/kg). In 9b-treated mice, a rise
in SGOT activity (p > 0.05) was evident. Serum
SGPT
activity was significantly (p < 0.005) lower than
the infected control in all compound-treated groups on day 10. Levels
of both the enzymes were observed to decline in the surviving mice
of 9a (50 mg/kg) and its combination (G7) on day 28 (Table 3). In these groups,
SGPT activity was observed to be lower than the CQ-treated mice (81.86
± 9.65 IU/L) on day 28. The significantly lower levels of these
hepatic function biomarkers in the 9a-treated groups
as compared to the infected control point to the safety of this compound
to the liver function of the rodent host.

2.5.2 Kidney
Function Tests
Acute renal
failure is evident in severe malaria infection caused by P. falciparum and P. vivax,40 characterized by a rise in serum levels
of urea and creatinine. The levels of these biomarkers are used for
the assessment of kidney function. In the present study, a significant
increase (p < 0.0005) in serum urea and creatinine
level was recorded in negative control indicating impairment of renal
function. Among the treated mice, a rise in the serum creatinine level
was observed at higher concentration (100 mg/kg) of both the compounds-
and leucovorin-treated groups on day 10 (Figure 5A). Serum urea levels were significantly
(p < 0.05) lower than the infected control (G2)
on day 10 at low dose of 9a (G4)- and its combination-treated
groups (G7) (Figure 5B). Elevation in urea levels was observed (p >
0.05)
in 9b-treated groups on day 10. In the surviving mice
(G4, G7), the serum creatinine and urea levels were observed to decrease
by day 28. These findings highlight the safety of compound 9a to kidney function of the host at lower doses.

groups on day 28. Data are expressed as mean ± SD for five mice
per group as compared to infected control. p-Value

3 Conclusions
The
current study highlights the substantial potential of THβC’s
as a novel antimalarial agent along with their safety on the hepatic
and renal functions of the rodent host. The majority of the β
carboline derivatives exhibited prominent in vitro activity against
the parasite. The compound 9a and its combination with
leucovorin exhibited best antimalarial activity in vivo in terms of
parasite clearance as well as enhancement of survival of the rodent
host. The compound is also safe to the hepatic and renal functions
of the host as evident from biochemical studies. Further studies are
underway to assess its potential against the human malaria parasite P. falciparum and its combination therapy with artesunate.
The encouraging results of this preliminary antimalarial activity
screening and in vivo efficacy highlights the need for further detailed
analysis of THβC’s to provide greater insights into their
antiplasmodial potential.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 General
Commercially available reagents
were used without further purification. TLC was carried out on Merck
silica gel F254 aluminum sheets and visualized under UV
light at 254 and/or 360 nm and/or by chemical staining with ninhydrin
or iodine. Diastereomers were separated by flash column chromatography
using 230–400 mesh size silica gel (fisher). 1H
and 13C spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance II 400
MHz spectrophotometer in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 or using mixture of these solvents. IR spectra were
recorded on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 50 FT-IR system. Mass spectrometry
was carried out using a Waters Q-TOF micromass system. Chemical shifts
are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane
(TMS) as the internal standard. Following abbreviations were used
in reporting spectra: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), m (multiple).

4.2 General Procedure for the Synthesis of 8a and 9a
l-Tryptophan (1 g,
4.89 mmol) was taken in a round bottom flask, freshly distilled TMSCl
(1.23 mL, 9.88 mmol) was added followed by the addition of dry methanol
(20 mL), and the resulting solution was stirred at RT. After completion
of the reaction (monitored by TLC), the mixture was concentrated on
a rotary evaporator and coevaporated 3–4 times with methanol
to give l-tryptophan methylester hydrochloride (7) in 96% yield (1.2 g, 4.71 mmol). To a solution of pipernol (707
mg, 4.711 mmol, 1.2 equiv) in 10 mL of isopropanol, l-tryptophan
methylester hydrochloride 7 (1 g, 3.926 mmol) was added,
and the resulting suspension was heated at reflux. After the completion
of reaction (monitored by TLC, approximate 8 h), the mixture was concentrated
on a rotary evaporator. The reaction mixture was further basified
with saturated solution of aq K2CO3 (40 mL)
and extracted with ethylacetate. The organic layer was washed with
brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated
to give mixture of 8a and 9a, which were
separated using flash column chromatography (silica gel. 230–400).

analysis was consistent with that reported in the literature.42

4.4 Experimental Animals
White Swiss
albino mice, Mus musculus of Laca strain
4–6 weeks old, weighing 25–30 g were used as an experimental
model in the present study. Mice were obtained from and kept in the
Central Animal House, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India. The animals
were kept under controlled temperature and humidity conditions and
were fed upon standard pellet diet and water ad libitum. The guidelines
of the committee for the purpose of control and supervision on experiments
on animals (45/GO/ReBi/S/99/CPCSEA) were followed during the experimental
procedures.

4.5 Parasite Strain
Asexual blood stages
of CQ-sensitive strain of P. berghei (NK-65) were maintained in vivo in Laca mice. Experimental infections
were initiated by intraperitoneal inoculation of 1 × 106P. berghei-infected erythrocytes/reticulocytes
in citrate saline from infected to naive mice.

4.6 In Vitro
Antiplasmodial Efficacy against P. berghei
In vitro antiplasmodial activity
of the compounds was assessed against P. berghei by schizont maturation inhibition assay.43 The stock solution of compounds (10 mg/mL) was prepared by dissolving
a known quantity of compound in DMSO (1%). The stock solution was
further diluted with culture medium, to make the required concentration
(5 μg/mL) of the compounds. CQ (10 μM) was used as the
positive control. Complete medium (1
mL; RPMI-1640) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and mixture
of normal and infected mouse erythrocytes at 2% parasitaemia contained
either 10 μL of compounds (different concentrations in duplicate)
or standard drug in each well. The titer plate was shaken gently to
mix contents. Smears were prepared at 0 h, and the culture plate was
incubated at 37 °C in a candle jar (5% CO2, 3% O2, 78% N2) using the Trager and Jensen method.44 The percent schizont maturation inhibition was
calculated by the following formula:  

4.7 Acute Toxicity
The limit test of
Lorke was used to assess the acute toxicity of the compounds.35 The compounds were dissolved in the standard
suspension vehicle (SSV) as done in our earlier study.45 Normal female mice were divided into two groups
consisting of three mice each. A highest testing dose of 5 g/kg was
orally administered to the mice following 4 h fasting. In case of
mortality, lower doses of compounds were administered, till LD50 was determined. The mice were kept under observation for
2 weeks after the administration of compounds to assess the various
side effects including mortality. Guidelines of the Canadian Council
on Animal Care (CCAC) were followed for the acceptable oral dose volumes
in rodents (ACC-2012-Tech09).

4.8 In Vivo
Suppressive Activity against P. berghei
The suppressive activity of the
compounds was evaluated by the Knight and Peters method.46 Mice were divided into 10 experimental groups
(G1 to G10) consisting of five mice each (Table 2). The sample size of 5 animals per group
was determined based on the calculations done by Charan and Kantharia.47 On day 1 (D0), all the mice were inoculated
with 1 × 106P. berghei-infected erythrocytes (except G1) as done in our earlier study.45 Drug treatment was initiated 1 h post-parasite-inoculation
and was continued once daily for 4 days (D0–D3). In the combination
therapy group, the second drug was administered at an interval of
20 min. Twenty four hours after the completion of 4-day dose regimen,
thin blood smears were made from the tail of each mouse on day 5 (D4).
The slides were fixed in methanol followed by Giemsa staining. The
percent chemosuppression was calculated by using the following formula:  where A is the average parasitaemia
in infected control and B is the average parasitaemia
in the treated group.

The ED50 representing 50% suppression
of parasite due to the compounds was also calculated. The therapeutic
index (ratio of LD50 and ED50) for the compounds
was also determined.

4.9 Measurements of Basic Parameters
All treated and control group mice were observed visually throughout
the experiment for behavioral changes and signs of illness which include
lethargy, reduction of movement, passage of dark urine, and impaired
consciousness.48 These signs of illness
were recorded as either absent (−), mild (+), moderate (++),
or severe (+++). Mortality was recorded throughout the experiment.

4.10 Biochemical Assays
The biochemical
assays were performed by taking blood from mice by tail vein drainage
on day 10 and survivors of experimental groups on day 28. All biochemical
assays were carried out using commercially available diagnostic kits
(Reckon Diagnostic P. Ltd. Gorwa, Baroda, Gujarat, India and Transasia
Bio Medicals Ltd., Baddi, Distt. Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India).

4.10.1 Liver Function Tests
ALP,49 SGOT,50 and SGPT51 activities and bilirubin51 levels were
checked in serum of mice for assessment of
hepatic function.

4.10.2 Kidney Function Tests
Serum levels
of urea52 and creatinine53 were measured for assessment for renal function.
