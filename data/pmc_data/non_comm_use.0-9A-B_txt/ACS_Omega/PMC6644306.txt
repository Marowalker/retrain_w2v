Crystal
structures are reported for bicyclic 3-CF3C6H4CN5S3 and monocyclic 3-CF3C6H4CN3S2, the
latter of which is strongly dimerized in a cis-cofacial
geometry [3-CF3C6H4CN3S2]2. The title compounds have previously been
characterized in solution by NMR, displaying spectra that are consistent
with the structure of [3-CF3C6H4CN3S2]2 in the crystal with anti-oriented CF3 substituents. The interannular binding was
investigated using density functional theory (DFT) methods. However,
the DFT-optimized geometry spreads the aryl rings too far apart (centroid–centroid
distances of ≥4.353 Å versus experimental distance of
3.850 Å). Significant improvements are obtained with dispersion-corrected
DFT functionals B3LYP-D3, B3LYP-D3BJ, M062X, and APFD using the 6-311+G(2d,p)
basis set. However, all of these overbind the aryl rings with centroid–centroid
distances of 3.612, 3.570, 3.526, and 3.511 Å, respectively.
After selecting B3LYP-D3BJ/6-311+G(2d,p) as the best method, five
alternative dimer geometries were tested, and all were found to be
binding; however, anti cofacial-4 (matching the structure
in the solid state) is the most stable. Computed energies of the remainder
are as follows: +7.0 kJ mol–1 (syn-cofacial-5), +26.7 kJ mol–1 (anti-cofacial-64), +27.0 kJ mol–1 (syn-cofacial-150), +102.0 kJ mol–1 (S,S-antarafacial),
and +103.7 kJ mol–1 (S,N-antarafacial), where the
suffixes are torsional angles around the CN3S2 thiazyl ring centroids. The binding in the four most stable cofacial
dimers may be described by “double pancake bonding”.

Introduction
Pancake bonding (PB),
is an evocative name for two-electron/multicenter (2e/mc) bonding between π-stacked dimers of organic and light-atom
radicals. This terminology was apparently introduced quite casually
by Mulliken and Person back in 1969,1 was
revived in this century by Suzuki et al.,2 and has since become popular.3−23 Several reviews are available on the PB concept,24,25 which should be distinguished from dispersion interactions in conventional
“π-stacking” between diamagnetic aromatic rings,
which is strictly due to London forces. By contrast, PB involves maximizing
overlap of the (delocalized) π-somos (singly occupied molecular
orbitals), which can be observed in the relative orientation of the
atoms of the combining rings (and hence of any substituents). Although
originally introduced to deal with hydrocarbons, PB is now also commonly
used for heterocyclic thiazyls.24,25 For example, three
of the five experimentally validated geometries, whereby planar and
thermally stable 1λ2,2λ2-dithia-3,5-diazolyl
(DTDA) radicals associate into dimers, “lock in” to
maximize the overlap of the π-somos of the monomeric species
(I–III in Scheme 1).24,26

Scheme 1 Five Dimerization
Modes of 4-R-1,2,3,5-Dithiadiazolyl Dimers Showing
the π*−π* Interactions: cis-Cofacial I, Cofacial-90 II, trans-Cofacial III, trans-Antarafacial IV,
and Orthogonal V
However, the heteroatom character of DTDAs and the inclusion
of the third-period element S promote certain motifs such as trans-antarafacial IV and orthogonal V, which are not classified as PB in hydrocarbon radicals.
These latter modes in DTDAs are rare and have only been confirmed
crystallographically in rather complex mixed-configuration structures;
the driving force for these latter associations could be primarily
spin pairing of the radicals. Intriguingly, Beneberu et al. showed
that the computed PB interaction energies in DTDAs follow the sequence I > II > III ≈ IV for HCN2S2 (V was not
considered), illustrating the dominance of the orbital interactions
by the greater overlap between the larger and more diffuse p orbitals
of S compared to N and C.6 That is, just
two long S···S contacts appear to provide as much binding
energy as a full face-to-face ring interaction in III, where these are all of the S···N type.6 Also significant for the DTDA study is the availability
of crystal structures for prototypical HCN2S2–this is a real molecule that has been investigated both as
a monomeric radical and a diamagnetic dimer.27−29 Importantly,
evidence for dimerization of DTDAs in solution has also been obtained
from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV–vis spectroscopies.30,31

PB is relatively weak (estimated at −75 kJ mol–1 for I), involving maximally 2e spread over many atoms, and is further weakened by the
small stabilization that results when the rings bond without atom
rehybridization (to preserve aromatic delocalization). The small HOMO–LUMO
gap in PB dimers results in significant diradicaloid character (estimated
at 0.32e for I by multiconfigurational
self-consistent field (MCSCF) calculations), further reducing the
net bonding e density. Moreover, the combining species
are, in general, persistent free radicals that usually can exist independent
of their dimers, so they are also good leaving groups. PB is a popular
concept, because it captures all these characteristics in a simple
heuristic approach that also has a pedagogical value. However, the essence of the idea
was captured much earlier by “diffuse π*−π*
overlap” to explain many interactions in electron-rich, unsaturated
thiazyl (i.e., −S·=N−) compounds.32 As introduced, this concept was a unifying framework
for many interactions between such electron-rich unsaturated moieties,
whether diamagnetic or paramagnetic (for example, it rationalizes
the formation of transannular short contacts in thiazyl cage compounds
such as the paradigmatic S4N4 structure).31 Significantly, diffuse π*−π*
overlap was also used to develop the dimerization of the (formally
antiaromatic) 8π 5-phenyl-1λ2,3λ2-dithia-2,4,6-triazine, wherein the very short transannular
contacts were rationalized through four-electron multicenter (4e/mc) interactions (Figure 1).33,34

Figure 1 Diffuse π*−π* bonding
between 8π antiaromatic thiazyl heterocycles.

Kertesz and co-workers recently coined the term
“double pancake bonding” (DPB) to describe such 4e/mc bonding between cofacial electron-rich ring systems
as a conceptual extension of 2e/mc PB through in-depth
computational work using a combination of complete active space (CASSCF)
and multireference average quadratic coupled cluster (MR-AQCC),35 as well as a large number of density functional
theory (DFT) methods.15,35 To date, these workers have only
considered a cis-cofacial bonding motif (analogous
to I) and restrict their investigations to the [HCN3S2]2 dimer, which, for this heterocycle,
is only a hypothetical model system. Unlike for the corresponding
DTDA and for H2C2N4S2,36 experimental routes to the parent heterocycle
have not been worked out for DTTAs and would face significant obstacles
from the high acidity of the hydrogen site. DPB has also been applied
to boron and nitrogen-substituted phenalenyls (PLYs),37 mimicking the extensive use of single PBs to all-carbon
PLY dimers.24 To date, just two 1λ2,3λ2-dithia-2,4,6-triazine (DTTA) dimers,34,381 and 2 (Chart 1), have been structurally characterized,
and both exist as cis-cofacial dimers with short
S···S contacts, which, at a mean of 2.571 Å, far
exceed standard covalent bond distances (2.04 Å) but are also
much less than ∑rvdW = 3.35 Å.39

Chart 1 Structures of DTTA Dimers 1–3
Recently, Haberhauer and Gleiter,
also using only computational methods (DFT as well as coupled cluster
singe-double perturbative triple or CCSD(T)–the latter of which
is restricted to [HCN3S2]2), have
questioned the existence of DPB in DTTAs,40 proposing instead that “long chalcogen–chalcogen bonds”
best describe the interaction in this ring system. In view of the
paucity of experimental evidence, we set out to obtain structural
data for the DTTA dimer 3 that was previously synthesized,
because this dimer has already been characterized in solution.38 Thus, using 1H NMR, it was shown
that the only species present in (very dilute) solutions of 3 is a dimer wherein the two 3-CF3-C6H4 rings are π-stacked as in cyclophanes, as indicated
by position-dependent shifts to higher frequencies.38 This specific DTTA is of further interest because of our
recently reported work on the structure of 3-CF3-C6H4-CN2S26,
that is, the similarly substituted DTDA, which dimerizes in two different
motifs (I and II from Scheme 1) within a single crystal structure.41 Herein, we now report that 3 indeed
adopts the cis-coplanar geometry in crystalline lattices
and that it has the anti disposal of the 3-CF3 groups that was implied from the symmetry of the NMR spectra.
Furthermore, to assess the likelihood that other structural motifs
for DTTAs could be operative, we have undertaken a detailed structural
investigation using DFT computational methods. Our work confirms previous
results indicating the importance of including dispersion-correction
terms to accurately predict the binding energies in such dimers.40 Indeed, we found that without dispersion correction,
the common DFT methods are unable to accurately reproduce even the
structures of DTTA dimers. Using dispersion-corrected DFT, we have
evaluated the relative energies of five different dimer conformations
that could plausibly compete with that observed in the crystal structures
of 1–3. Finally, we reflect on the
pros and cons of using DPB to describe DTTA dimers.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
Compound 3 is prepared by the literature procedure
in a two-step process (Scheme 2) wherein the corresponding thiazyl RCN5S3 cage compound 4 suspended in CCl4 is reacted
with gaseous Cl2, which leads in high yield to the thermally
unstable S,S-dichloride 5.38 Reduction of 5 is best undertaken in rigorously freeze–thaw
(3×) degassed CHCl3 using the effective reducing agent
Ph3Sb under conditions where the byproduct Ph3SbCl2 remains in solution. Dark-red plates of crystalline 3 form directly from the synthesis reaction if attention is
paid to the correct temperature and solvent volumes.

Scheme 2 Two-Step
Preparation of Compound 3
Crystallography
Crystals suitable for X-ray crystal structure determination were
obtained for 3 and 4, whereas the thermal
instability of 5 foiled attempts to obtain a crystal
structure for this compound. The structural results are depicted in Figures 2 and 3, respectively; full crystallographic details are provided
in Supporting Information. The cage structure
of 4 is similar to that of the 16 related structures
found in the Cambridge Structure Database (CSD, updates to November
2017).42 These other structures include
a number of different substituents at C1, including aryl groups, halogens,
trihalomethyls, and tert-butyl. Several examples
have cocrystallized solvents, and several examples have aromatic solvents
that π-stack with an aryl substituent. The intermolecular distances
and angles (Table 1) within the CN5S3 cage are indistinguishable
from those in the published exemplars.

The most interesting feature of 4 is the lattice structure. Whereas all such RCN5S3 cages have strong intermolecular interactions, (∑rvdW − 0.20) Å or less, in their crystal lattices,
the propagation of the contacts in 4 is unique. The contacts
do not appear to fall within the purview of chalcogen bonding, and N lone pair-type donors interact with
perpendicular p orbitals of the sp2 hybridized ring C and
N=S=N S atoms. Thus, the characteristic δS+···δN– interactions are associated with the electron-rich nature of the
thiazyls, and their origin therefore probably lies with London forces
(see Supporting Information for further
information).

The structure of dimer 3 as found
in the crystal lattice is depicted in Figure 3 and possesses a similar cis-cofacial arrangement of the DTTA rings, as previously reported for
dimers 1 and 2. The approach distance between
the two rings minimizes the S···S distances, which,
at 2.5069(7) and 2.4956(7) Å, are “short” but still
21.4% longer than a single (σ) bond (2.04 Å) and −0.85(1)
< ∑rvdW = 3.35 Å (25.4%).39 The DTTA rings are also no longer planar, because
the S1–N2–S2 and S3–N5–S4 moieties tip
gently out of the CN2S2 planes (mean dihedral
angle = 17.6(2)°). Apart from this feature, the structure is
strongly reminiscent to that of cis-cofacial DTDA
dimers, except that the pairs of S atoms are drawn in much closer
than the mean of 3.12(2) Å, or −0.48(2) < ∑rvdW, found for four cis-cofacial
dimers in the lattice of 6.41 To avoid ambiguities (also when comparing to more distorted geometries
in alternative, DFT-computed, structure types), in this work, recourse
will be taken to the distance i···i′ between
ring centroids for the CN3S2 rings (2.759 Å; Figure 3).

A second
significant feature of the structure is the wedge-shaped orientation
of the aromatic rings (Figure 3a), which tilt apart with a dihedral angle of 15.35(1)°.
A simple one-parameter ring separation is obtained by defining a distance
ii···ii′ of 3.850 Å between the two aryl
ring centroids. However, the rings are also significantly skewed (Figure 3b). Thus, to compare
the degree of aryl ring separation to the ∼3.50 Å found
in strongly π-stacked interactions between strictly nonbonded
aryl rings on adjacent aromatic hydrocarbons,43 a more representative interannular parameter is required. If the
C2 → C7 and C12 → C17 phenyl rings are each defined
by least-squares planes, then it is possible to determine the range
of distances of the opposite ring atoms to each plane from 3.120(3)
to 3.922(3) (mean = 3.518 Å). Thus, tethered to the strongly
binding DTTA rings, the phenyl rings seem to balance repulsive and
attractive dispersion forces and achieve an average separation very
close to that predicted for π-stacking and do so by being significantly
rotated from the attached CN2S3 rings (mean
of the torsion angles = 7.7(2)°). This torsion allows the rings
to skew (centroids are disposed 23.4° from fully aligned; see Table 2 and Figure 3b). Of course, it is important not to overinterpret
such geometries in a crystal structure (for a discussion of the significant
crystal packing forces, see Supporting Information), so the solution (from NMR) and gas-phase structures (for the computation,
see below) should also be considered.

Now consider what effect
the obvious repulsions between the aryl rings have on the tilt angles
of the thiazyl rings to which they are attached. We define a least-squares
plane through the flat CN2S2 portions of each
of the rings in the crystal structure of 3. These have
an angle of 13.07(7)° between them (so that the phenyl groups
each bend further outward about 2° at the attachment point).
By comparison, in high-level CCSD(T) computed structures of the “parent”
[HCN3S2]2 dimers,35,40 which also show a similar tilted geometry because the S atoms make
the closest interannular approach, this angle is 11.4°, whereas
MR-AQCC(4,4)/6-311++G(2d,2p) predicts 10.4°.35 Thus, the net aryl ring repulsion (and steric effects of
the CF3 substituents) on the wedge-shaped structures of
DTTA dimers appears to be small but not negligible. For comparison
with the dimer of PhCN3S2 (CSD refcode: DESSID),
this angle is 12.5°,34 whereas with
the dimer of 4-ClC6H4CN3S2 (refcode: PAFLAJ), it is 12.6°;38 both could be expected to have smaller substituent steric effects
than 3. The implications of the above factors on the
choice of isomer and overall geometry are addressed by DFT computational
work (see below).

Solution Structure
The known DTTAs,
despite being small, light-atom molecules, have been reported to be
very insoluble.34,38,44 This is likely a consequence of strong association into dimers as
well as significant interdimer contacts in the solid lattices (see Supporting Information). By contrast, comparably
substituted DTDA dimers are highly soluble species in a range of mid-
to low-polarity solvents, possibly because of an equilibrium involving
dissociation into monomers.24 It is therefore
challenging to determine the structures of DTTAs in solution, but 3 was found to be sufficiently soluble in CDCl3 to allow 1H NMR spectra to be determined.38 By comparing with the analogous alkene adducts
that are monomeric in solution and in the solid state, it was concluded
that these aryl-DTDAs preserve the wedge-shaped structure in solution,
similar to that seen in Figure 3. This conclusion is based on the high-frequency shifts of
the signals similar to that observed for cyclophanes–the ring
H atoms experience a net anisotropic shielding effect from the neighboring
ring. Moreover, the observed 1H signals have symmetry that
is consistent with the anti disposition of the CF3 substituents, also as in Figure 3.

Computational Investigation
Role of Dispersion
and Method Verification
In a recent paper, Mou et al. performed
careful and very extensive validations of more than 50 DFT functionals
for their ability to reproduce the geometry and binding energy of
the cis-cofacial [HCN3S2]2 isomer of the parent DTTA ring15 using the MR-AQCC high-level values previously determined
by this same research group as reference geometry. Using their criteria,
about 15% of the tested methods fit a dimer energy threshold of ±42
kJ mol–1, whereas 59% predicted the S···S
separation distance to within 0.1 Å. These criteria limited the
number of recommended methods for DTTAs to a small list of 10 standard
and 6 dispersion-corrected DFT functionals; the “best method”
recommended for both geometry and energy is standard O3LYP.45 Unfortunately, by using only the hypothetical
HCN3S2 heterocycle in these tests, the suitability
of these methods for experimentally verifiable compounds was not investigated.
Thus, when we applied recommended B3LYP in conjunction with double-ζ
6-31+G(2d,p) and triple-ζ 6-311+G(2d,p) basis sets, a very unrealistic
geometry resulted, in which the aryl rings are spread too far apart
(centroids separation ii···ii′ = 4.353 Å;
see Figure 4a). With
O3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p), in this work, the geometry converged at an extreme of ii···ii′
= 4.717 Å, causing a 26.7° tilt angle between upper and
lower rings, that is, grossly distorting the DTTA dimer. Thus, we
turned to dispersion-corrected methods to deal with this unrealistic
repulsion of the aryl rings.

Figure 4 Overlay diagrams of the experimental structure,
shown as displacement ellipsoids, of 3 with the results,
shown as ball and tube, from (a) standard [B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)] 3a′′′′ and (b) dispersion-corrected [B3LYP-D3BJ/6-311+G(2d,p)] 3a calculations.

We were able to validate a limited number of dispersion-corrected
methods, and the results from fully optimized DFT/6-311+G(2d,p) calculations
verified to have zero imaginary frequencies are listed in Table 2. In view of the good
performance of B3LYP in the energy criterion of Mou et al.,15 we included both the original B3LYP-D3 and the
now-recommended B3LYP-D3BJ methods of Grimme.46−48 We also tried
out M062X,49 which is widely used for main
group inorganic compounds because it has built-in dispersion correction
and also the APFD method that is now recommended for use with Gaussian
16.50

All the dispersion-corrected
methods that were tried significantly reduced the phenyl ring separation
(distance ii···ii′ in Table 2); at the same time, the binding between
thiazyl rings is more accurately estimated (distance i···i′).
The latter seems to indicate that dispersion effects operate alongside
DPB in the thiazyl core dimerization, although a contribution from
reduced strain induced by phenyl ring repulsions in the standard DFT-calculated
geometries cannot be ruled out. Note, however, that all these methods
somewhat overbind the aryl groups so that the distance ii···ii′
is now shorter than in experiment by 6.2–8.8%. Intriguingly,
with the use of these methods, the relative conformation adopted by
the two 3-CF3C6H3 rings is also significantly
improved (see Figure 4b). They much more closely match the crystal structure geometry with
respect to inter-ring separation, torsion angle to the CN2S3 rings, and the skewing of aryl ring centroids (Table 2). We have therefore
calculated for each result the average perpendicular ring separation,
as discussed above for the crystal structure, and this value and its
% deviation from the experimental value are also listed in Table 2. From this limited
comparison set, we selected the (U/R)B3LYP-D3BJ empirically corrected
dispersion functional in conjunction with the triple-ζ 6-311+G(2d,p)
basis set for all further work in this study as the best compromise
between accuracy of thiazyl and aryl ring separations and orientation.
Moreover, compared to the other methods, it was proven to be computationally
more efficient by a significant margin.

Using this adopted method,
we then verified the electronic structure of the computed dimer 3a in this cis-cofacial geometry. Frontier
molecular orbitals (FMOs) are presented in Figure 5. Both in orbital topologies and relative
energies, the electronic structure using this modern DFT method strongly
corroborates the bonding picture developed earlier using empirical
and semiempirical approaches (Figure 1).32−34 Thus, the concept of diffuse π*−π*
interactions still appears to be very relevant to a description of
the electronic structure of strongly binding DTDA dimers such as 3a. The final electronic structure is thus consistent with
a face-to-face association of monomers that either have a triplet
ground state or from singlet ground states with easily populated biradicaloids.
There is also nothing substantively new from these DFT calculations
compared to much earlier STO-3G* calculations.51 Nevertheless, in view of reports in the literature from

Computed Monomers 3m–3o
In their critique of DPB,
Haberhauer and Gleiter argue from the relative CCSD(T) computed energies
of monomeric DTTA HCN3S2.40 Because 3 is made by the reductive dechlorination
of monomeric 5, it is reasonable to assume that the dimers
form through the association of monomeric DTTA moieties, although
such species have never been isolated or characterized. By contrast,
in isoelectronic EN3S2 heterocycles, closely
related species in which the RC component of the structure is replaced
by either an E = R2P or E = {O2S}− moiety, stable antiaromatic
monomeric species have been verified both in solution and in the solid
state.52 Crystal structures have been reported
for at least five exemplars (Chart 2; CSD refcodes: CANWUJ,53 DEVCUD,54 NIPHDS,55 NSIAPS,56 and PIZXIF57). The most extensively studied of these intriguing
compounds is Ph2PN3S2 (NIPHDS), but
this is the only one to have an almost planar geometry in its crystal
structure. This deep purple-colored compound is thermally stable but
has a fascinating reactivity; moreover, it can be purified in air
using size-exclusion chromatography.52 The
other structures, all bearing more electron-donating substituents
at the heteroatom, present with rings that are strongly folded across trans-disposed N and S atoms (Chart 2).

Chart 2 Monomeric (Hetero)DTTA Geometries from Crystallography
and DFT Calculations
Very briefly, we have calculated fully optimized structures
using B3LYP-D3BJ/6-311+G(2d,p) for the triplet monomer 3m (relative energy of +5.21 kJ mol–1), singlet-Cs monomer 3n (relative energy of
+6.02 kJ mol–1), and singlet-C1 monomer 3o (most stable). The Cs (planar) 3n has an imaginary frequency
that distorts toward the C1 geometry when
using triple-ζ basis sets.51 The
resultant structures (Chart 2) include 3m as almost planar except for a very
mild tipping of the terminal SNS moiety (dihedral angle = 10.5°);
interestingly, this structural motif can be recognized in both experimental 3 and computed dimers 3a such that these DTTAs
present geometrically as the dimers of triplet-state monomers. Planar 3n has shorter and longer bond lengths with a distinct N=S=N
component, whereas the stable singlet 3o has a noticeably
folded structure (folded about the dashed line shown in Chart 2). This calculated geometry
for 3o is quite similar to that adopted by the four hetero-DTTAs
with donor substituents (CANWUJ,53 DEVCUD,54 NSIAPS,56 and PIZXIF57). At our level of theory, the calculated energy
differences between these three monomer geometries (3m–3o) amount to less than kT under
ambient conditions.

Alternative Dimerization Modes
Published
CCSD(T) calculations, also undertaken with HCN3S2 moieties, identified additional binding modes for DTTA dimers.40 There is as yet no experimental evidence for
the existence of such structures, but the possibility should be given
serious consideration because the radical dimers of DTDAs [RCN2S2]2 have the five verified structural
motifs shown in Scheme 1. We therefore investigated alternative isomers of computed geometry 3a, and the results are presented in Table 3 and Figure 6. An obvious alternative geometry is one where the
aryl rings are rotated such that the CF3 groups are syn rather than anti. Although, intuitively,
this might be thought to suffer from increased steric interactions,
such syn isomers of 3-substituted aryl DTDA dimers
with a cis-cofacial structure are well attested to
in the literature.26,41 Our computations successfully
optimize rotamer 3b at a mere 7.0 kJ mol–1 higher in energy. Significantly,
the pairs of aryl rings in both 3a and 3b are oriented with a similar degree of coplanarity and have quite
similar centroid separations.

two CF3 groups or opposite to them.

f A more meaningful torsion for 3f might
be about the N···S axis (167.3°).

The Cipso–i–i′–Cipso torsion angles of computed 3a and 3b are 3.7° and 4.8°, respectively. Because many DTTA dimers
have such intermediate torsion angles, the utility of generic terms cis and trans is questionable. Hence, we
now introduce alternative designations for the cofacial isomers (Table 3) based on these torsion
angles. All these alternative geometries could be minimized using
the B3LYP-D3BJ/6-311+G(2d,p) method as fully optimized without imaginary
frequencies (Figure 6). They can differ significantly in geometry even when their relative
energies are close. For example, anti-cofacial-64 3c (relative to the CN3S2 centroids,
+26.7 kJ mol–1) comprised one heavily distorted
DTTA ring connected via a short S···N contact of 2.075
Å (17% longer than an S–N single bond of 1.77 Å),
connected to a second that has the geometry of the triplet monomer 3m (Figure 6c).

In stark contrast to this, the cofacial-150 isomers 3d, 3d′, and 3d″,
which differ only in the orientations of the CF3 groups
(+26.3 to +27.0 kJ mol–1), have almost planar CN3S2 rings and a shortest S···S contact
of 2.689 Å (32% longer than an S–S single bond of 2.04
Å). Unlike in 3a and 3b, the remote
location of the CF3 groups in this isomer has almost no
effect on energetics or geometry. In contrast to the three cofacial
isomers 3a, 3c, and 3d, the
two antarafacial dispositions are considerably less stable. The rather
unlikely looking 3f geometry is obtained from 3c by twisting about the S···N contact and retains the
more distorted ring shapes of the latter. By contrast, trans-antarafacial 3e, with two tantalizingly short S···S
contacts (2.465 Å, 29% longer than covalent single bonds) and
a torsion angle of 180.0°, has both CN3S2 rings quite similar to that of 3m but with a higher
S2N tip angle (30.2°compared to 18.0° in 3a). However, the relative energies of 3e and 3f are almost identical (+102.0 and +103.7 kJ mol–1, respectively). Although all five basic shapes are net binding with
regard to the monomers, the cofacial isomers that maximize DPB are
heavily favored energetically. Finally, it seems highly likely that
the main energetic advantage of 3a over 3c and 3d is the stabilizing influence of the aryl-aryl
and aryl-CF3 dispersion forces, in agreement with earlier
predictions.40 In Table S11, we report equivalent data to that in Table 3 for the optimized geometries
of dimers of the corresponding prototypical ring HCN3S27. Unlike the CCSD(T) results previously reported,
using our standard method, the cofacial-0 geometry is still the most
stable, but cofacial-150 and cofacial-64 are only slightly less favorable
at +5.5 and +6.1 kJ mol–1, respectively. The two
antarafacial geometries, by contrast, remain significantly disfavored
at +65.9 kJ mol–1.

Scheme 3 thus shows both the HOMO and HOMO-1 of the
dimer pairs and is based on the full Kohn–Sham orbital isosurfaces
determined from the DFT calculations. With respect to a choice between
short “covalent” interannular bonds and DPB, there is
an overall loss of binding energy of 77 kJ mol–1 upon twisting the rings from cofacial to antarafacial. Unlike the
situation in DTDAs, the (almost trans) cofacial-150 VIII is much more favorable than IX despite the
ability of the latter to form two S···S “bonds”.
DPB thus seems to be a very reasonable description for the three better
binding modes VI–VIII (Scheme 3), which “lock in”
the phase orientation of the π-orbitals in at least one of the
two interacting FMOs. Further speculation on these alternative geometries
is not warranted at present in the absence of experimental evidence
for their existence.

Modes Showing the π*−π* Interactions of HOMO (top)
and HOMO-1 (bottom): Cofacial-4 VI, Cofacial-64 VII, Cofacial-150 VIII, and trans-Antarafacial IX
Beyond the three structurally attested type VI DTTA dimers 1–3 that have been
the subject of this study, the literature references two other compound
classes. Thus, CF3CN3S2 has been
prepared and characterized by spectroscopic means.44 It is described as an unusually insoluble (in view of its
size and fluorine content) red solid that decomposes slowly at room
temperature. Nothing further has been reported on the DTTA, but many
derivatives have been prepared that confirm the chemical identity
of the red solids. There are also similar reports of thermally unstable
purple solids for Et2NCN3S2 and iPr2NCN5S2,
but no structures have been obtained.58 Thus, experimental verification of the possible structures with
different geometries, in systems that lack the additional stabilization
afforded by aromatic π-stacking as in 3, has not
yet been possible. In preliminary DFT investigations, it would appear
that [CF3CN3S2]28 should exist with binding energies in the range of −120
kJ mol–1 with very little preference among type VI, VII, and VIII isomers. By contrast,
[Me2NCN3S2]2 dimers 9 are calculated to bind by less than 1 kJ mol–1 (see Tables S12 and S13 in Supporting Information).

Conclusions
When essentially flat rings associate as
π-dimers in such a way as to maximize diffuse π-orbital
overlap, there is strong computational evidence for an orbital-overlap
contribution to the bond energy, often of comparable magnitude to
contributions from dispersion, electrostatics, or “charge flipping”.
This concept is summarized in the term pancake bonding and, hence,
also “double” pancake bonding in the case of DTTAs.24,25,35 When applied to hydrocarbons,
the distinctive character of pancake bonding can be unambiguously
defined, but when extended to thiazyl heterocycles, which have both
highly polarizable π-systems and are less resistant to deformation
from the ideal planar geometries for sp2 hybridization,
a more nuanced situation emerges. On balance, the evidence from the
structural and computational results described above indicates that
“double pancake bonding” represents a useful heuristic
for binding in the cofacial geometry VI that has been
experimentally verified in the solid state and in solution for 1–3. Two other modes of dimerization,
cofacial-64 VII and cofacial-150 VIII, appear
competitive with VI and are equally fittingly described
by DPB. By contrast, antarafacial mode IX, which does
not fit the concept of DPB, is also energetically not competitive.
Furthermore, the major source of the energetic preference for VI over VII and VIII, as observed
for dimer 3, is the dispersion interaction between the
aryl substituents, which is estimated here at a non-negligible value
of 27 kJ mol–1 or 17% of the dimerization energy,
although in view of the observed overbinding of π–π
stacked aryl substituents, this energy could be exaggerated. Thus,
in addition to further experimental work to confirm dimerization modes
for nonaryl DTTAs, more effort is needed to validate the best density
functionals that are able to provide accurate geometries by neither
overbinding nor underbinding pendant substituents.

X-ray Crystallography
Single crystals of C8H4F3N5S34 were obtained by cooling a hot CH3CN solution. A suitable
crystal was selected and mounted using a MiTeGen 100 μm loop
and Paratone oil on a SuperNova/Pilatus 200K diffractometer with a
Cu X-ray microsource focused by X-ray mirrors. The crystal was kept
at 100.01(10) K during data collection. Single crystals of C8H4F3N3S23 were grown from hot CHCl3. Data was collected in the
same manner at 99.98(13) K. Data collection was controlled, and data
was processed using CrysAlis Pro release 39.46.59 Using Olex2,60 the structure
was solved with the ShelXT61 structure

Computational Investigations
The general approach was to
do a full optimization at the DFT/6-31+G(2d,p) level with frequency
checks, followed by DFT/6-311+G(2d,p). The latter repeatedly displayed
imaginary frequencies that correspond to deformations toward the “correct”
geometries from the high-compliance WFT methods. Reoptimization starting
from statically deformed geometries then led to fully converged DFT/6-311+G(2d,p)
geometries without imaginary frequencies. A computed structure of 3 was first conducted with the B3LYP functional; although
this optimized fully, the geometry indicated excessive repulsion between
aryl substituents. Next, a series of functionals with different approaches
for inclusion of dispersion effects were tested, primarily using methods
already validated for DTTA dimers in the work of Mou et al. (B3LYP-D3,
B3LYP-D3BJ, M062X, O3LYP, and also the new APFD method built into
GW1663). The most tractable method (good
compromise between accuracy and efficiency) was B3LYP-D3BJ, which was thenceforth used for all other
calculations in conjunction with the abovementioned double-ζ
and triple-ζ Pople basis sets. Cartesian coordinates of all
the optimized geometries reported in this work are included in Supporting Information (Table S14).
