During storms in the southwestern United States, several
rattlesnake species have been observed drinking rain droplets collected
on their dorsal scales. This process often includes coiling and flattening
of the snake’s body, presumably to enhance water collection.
Here, we explored this rain-harvesting behavior of the Western Diamond-backed
Rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) from the
perspective of surface science. Specifically, we compared surface
wettability and texture, as well as droplet impact and evaporation
dynamics on the rattlesnake epidermis with those of two unrelated
(control) sympatric snake species (Desert Kingsnake, Lampropeltis splendida, and Sonoran Gopher Snake, Pituophis catenifer). These two control species are
not known to show rain-harvesting behavior. Our results show that
the dorsal scales of the rattlesnake aid in water collection by providing
a highly sticky, hydrophobic surface, which pins the impacting water
droplets. We show that this high pinning characteristic stems from
surface nanotexture made of shallow, labyrinth-like channels.

Introduction
To survive in xeric environments such
as desserts, many plants and animals have evolved specialized mechanisms
and strategies for collecting water from atmospheric moisture, fog,
or infrequent rains. Well-known examples include dew harvesting by
New- and Old World desert lizards1−3 and fog-droplet collection
by several beetle species in the Namib Desert.4−7 In several of these cases, the
unique way in which water is harvested from the environment is enabled
by highly specialized epidermal surface characteristics of the animal’s
body. In the case of desert lizards, their skin has hydrophilic microtexture
that facilitates direct condensation, as well as contact collection
of dew, rainfall, and absorption from moist sand, with subsequent
capillary transport of water to the mouth.8 Remarkably, the surface of the Namib desert beetle’s wings
has chemical and textural heterogeneities, which create hydrophilic–superhydrophobic
pattern that enables the capture, coalescence, and rolling of fog
droplets into the insect’s mouth.6

Here, we discuss how a desert-dwelling rattlesnake uses its
body to collect (harvest) and drink rain droplets and show how surface
properties of its dorsal scales play a key role in that process. In
the absence of a direct (freestanding) source of water, various species
of rattlesnakes9−17 that inhabit deserts have been reported to use their
bodies to collect or harvest rain for drinking. Intriguingly, the
Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) from southern Arizona has been observed to emerge from rock-structured
dens even during late winter to harvest rain, sleet, and snow.9

Regardless of the physical state of the
collected water, these snakes are reported to flatten (dorsoventral
flattening) their bodies considerably and at times form a tight coil
(see images in Figure 1a) for rain harvesting, presumably to enhance the collection of rain
droplets. As the rain droplets accumulate and coalesce on the dorsal
scales (with diameters of up to about 5 mm), the snake proceeds to
drink the water from various areas on its body. Notably, the process
of liquid intake from the scales to the mouth does not differ from
drinking from other types of sources or surfaces, including freestanding
water.10

Other species of snakes have been reported to drink
rain (or sprayed water) droplets from their bodies,11−14 but rain harvesting by certain
species of rattlesnakes stands out as a common and important behavior
for survival in hot and xeric environments.15 Rattlesnakes, like many other snakes, are known to have an elaborate
nanotexture on their dorsal scales.16 However,
the potential role these textures have on the interaction with water
during the phenomenon of rain harvesting has not been explored. Accordingly,
we systematically characterized surface nano-to-macroscale texture
and its effect on surface wettability and water droplet impact dynamics
on the dorsal skin (scales) of adult Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnakes
(C. atrox), a New World viperid (Viperidae:
Crotalinae). Two snake species (family Colubridae) that are syntopic
with C. atrox in the Sonoran Desert
were also studied for comparison, the Desert Kingsnake (Lampropeltis splendida) and Sonoran Gopher Snake
(Pituophis catenifer). The latter two
snake species are not known to show rain-harvesting behavior. The
Desert Kingsnake (L. splendida) has
macroscopically smooth dorsal scales, while the Sonoran Gopher Snake
(P. catenifer) and C.
atrox have macroscopic (observable) keels running
through the center and entire length of each dorsal scale of the main
body (see Figure 1c).
By performing water droplet impact and evaporation experiments on
the dorsal scales of these three snake species, we demonstrate that
the nanotexture and wettability of rattlesnake skin, but not the controls,
aid in rain droplet capture for drinking.

Results and Discussion
An example of in situ rain harvesting
of C. atrox is illustrated in Figure 1a, where the image
shows the coiled posture of the snake. In this posture, the snake
also flattens its body (dorsoventral flattening) to maximize the area
for droplet collection (Figure 1d). The close-up image (Figure 1b) reveals numerous rain droplets of various sizes
and moderate contact angles on the dorsal scales. The moderate contact
angles imply a mildly hydrophilic to hydrophobic surface. It is important
to note that droplets of a range of sizes collected on scales even
on the lateral regions of the body do not roll off but adhere to the
scales. In addition to the individual droplets, puddles as deep as
5 mm in size accumulate on the dorsal scales for brief periods owing
to droplet coalescence. Subsequently, these droplets and puddles are
consumed (imbibed) by the snake, which moves only its head and anterior-most
body to avoid disturbing the collected water on the scales and drinks
the droplets. Based on these in situ qualitative observations, the
scales of C. atrox appear to facilitate
water-harvesting behavior by offering a “sticky” surface
that promotes droplet adhesion. To provide quantitative insight into
this process, we perform controlled droplet impact experiments on
dorsal scales of the three snake species.

Droplet Impact Tests
In the first test, we delivered
a single drop of water (∼10 μL) on the snake sample from
a fixed 12.5 cm height. Figure 2 shows the sequence of three images indicating different times
of the droplet impact: I—before, II—during, and III—after
the impact. The procedure was repeated multiple times for all three
samples. A comparison between images in column III shows different
outcomes of the droplet impact on the three samples. For both the
kingsnake and the gopher snake (see Figure 2b,c), we see that the impacting droplet either
forms a shallow puddle or slips off the body depending upon the area
of contact (top vs side). In contrast, C. atrox splits the impacting droplet into a couple of secondary droplets,
which get pinned to the scales (see Movie 1). Consequently, the single-droplet impact experiments on the three
snake species show a strong correlation between highly pinning epidermis
and the rain-harvesting behavior.

Figure 2 Image sequence (left to right) of the
droplet impacting the snake’s dorsal scales when released from
a single height (12.5 cm) for the three samples: (a) C. atrox shows the droplet sticking to its scales
after the impact (inset: geometrical scaling of the droplet with respect
to scale), whereas (b) L. splendida and (c) P. catenifer shows the droplet
spreading on the scales and forming a puddle while also losing the
water due to shedding. The scale bar corresponds to 2.5 mm.

To provide a further understanding of droplet–surface
interactions during rain-harvesting behavior, we expanded droplet
impact experiments only on C. atrox with droplet release heights increased up to 120 cm. In the lowest
height (12.5 cm), impact velocities of the drops were very low ∼1
m s–1, which could be representative of scenarios
such as water dripping from rocks and bushes, which have been observed
in the field.9,15 In the highest release height
(120 cm), the terminal velocity of droplets is approximately 4–5
m s–1, which represents a light-to-medium stratiform
rain.18 If we compare these scenarios in
terms of the Weber number of the impacting droplet, which represents
the ratio of inertia to surface tension forces (product of density,
diameter, and the square of the droplet’s velocity divided
by its surface tension), the experiments span from 40 to 400. As this
number increases, the inertia force dominates over surface tension
forces. Consequently, the primary droplets break down into more secondary
droplets upon a higher impact. Many of these droplets adhere to the
scales, while a portion bounces off the scale. However, even in such
cases, we observed that numerous secondary droplets are pinned to
the scales (see Figure 2c-III), which can also be seen in Figure 1b. Thus, even at high droplet Weber numbers,
the scales can help retain much of the impacting water, albeit less
effectively than at lower Weber numbers. Also, it should be noted
that samples used in these experiments were deceased; so, the dorsoventral
flattening, as well as coiling, could not be reproduced during the
tests. Since this flattening and coiling behavior is likely to significantly
impact the amount of retained water, we did not attempt to quantify
its relation to the Weber number.

Harvesting water from rain
directly or indirectly involves repeated contact with droplets. Thus
far, we considered only the single-droplet impact, which does not
fully represent the natural scenarios. To simulate more realistic
conditions, we deposited multiple droplets from the height of 30 cm
on dorsal scales at regular intervals. The image sequence in Figure 3b shows results from
these experiments. After the first droplet impacts and splits into
a few pinned droplets, the subsequent incoming droplets cause them
to coalesce forming an agglomerated pool. This coalescence continues
until the size of the puddle is sufficiently large, which then slides
off the body. Even with higher Weber numbers (see Figure 3a, ∼400), the numerous
smaller droplets act like “collection sites” for subsequent
droplets and collect the water over longer durations as can be seen
in Figure 1b.

Weber number (We) achieved by changing the droplet
release height from 12.5 to 120 cm, (b) image sequence showing the
droplet agglomeration on dorsal scales of C. atrox when subjected to repeated contact with impacting droplets (n stands for the number of droplets). After 10 droplets,
the agglomerate becomes large enough and rolls off. The scale bar
corresponds to 5 mm.

Nano-to-Macroscle Characterization of the Dorsal Scales
Independent of the impact scenario, our droplet experiments show
that scales of C. atrox aid in retaining
the water droplets, which helps in the rain-harvesting behavior. Our
wetting measurements indicated that the dorsal scales of C. atrox have a significantly higher contact angle
than those of the L. splendida and P. catenifer. In particular, on the dorsal scales
of C. atrox, we measured a highly hydrophobic
effective water contact angle of 118 ± 12°. In turn, the
dorsal scales of the L. splendida were
significantly less hydrophobic with an effective water contact angle
of 104 ± 8°, while those of the P. catenifer were, on average, mildly hydrophilic with an effective water contact
angle of 88 ± 11°.

The differences that we observed
in the wettability of the snake scales likely stem from some variability
in the intrinsic wetting properties of the scale material, as well
as their surface texture.19,20 The scales of all of
the snakes consist of β keratin along with some lipids.21 The intrinsic wettability of these materials
is not well characterized but is known to vary depending on their
composition from mildly hydrophilic to mildly hydrophobic.21,22 Since the roughening of a surface magnifies its wetting properties,
the relatively significant difference in the observed contact angles,
especially between the C. atrox and P. catenifer, likely stems from the moderate difference
in inherent wetting properties of the scales’ material that
are amplified by the underlying surface texture.

On nano- to
microscale, the surface topology of the dorsal scales of the snakes
can range from nearly smooth to highly complex.16 Specifically, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images
of the scales of L. splendida (Figure 4a,b) reveal a nearly
smooth surface without any discernible nanopattern. The scales of P. catenifer have a more distinct nanoscale pattern
of parallel, shallow, and 5–10 μm long nanochannels,
whose consecutive layers appear to stack on each other (Figure 4c,d). In addition, the scales
of P. catenifer have microridges with
a height of a few micrometers that are spaced 10–20 μm
apart and run along the scale. The parallel, shallow nanochannels
occur predominantly in between the microridges whose tops, by comparison,
are much more smooth. In turn, the scales of C. atrox (Figure 4e,f) have
only nanochannels that are separated by prominent nanoridges that
run almost parallel to each other over a shorter scale (of the order
of a few micrometers) and make a complex, labyrinth-like network of
closely packed channels at a larger scale. These narrow ridges of
approximately 100 nm width and 300 nm height are spaced by, on average,
around a 600 nm gap. The labyrinth-like patterns are segregated by
thin, mostly straight, boundaries into four- to five-sided regions
that measure 30–50 μm across. The boundaries of these
regions are also easily observed under an optical microscope, as shown
in Figure 4g.

d) P. catenifer, and (e, f) C. atrox; insets show representative images of the
water droplet on the corresponding scales; (g) sequence of light microscopy
images showing the edge of a drying droplet on the scales of the C. atrox.

Imaging of the receding triple-phase contact line
(TPCL) during the evaporation of a droplet shows that water penetrates
into nanochannels and is pinned by the nanoridges on the C. atrox scales. Specifically, the sequence of optical
images in Figure 4g
shows the formation of multiple parallel water lines within the large-scale
regions as the droplet evaporates. The fact that the TPCL does not
recede smoothly but breaks up into multiple areas dictated by the
surface nanoridges provides another illustration of the highly pinning
nature of the C. atrox scales (see
also Movie 3). In contrast, the TPCL during
droplet evaporation on the scales of P. catenifer is continuous and occurs predominantly along the microridges (see Movie 4 and Supporting Information). Consequently, water penetrates into the topological features on
both the scales of C. atrox and P. catenifer (i.e., droplets are in Wenzel state;
see the Supporting Information for additional
experimental demonstration). This is not surprising since drop meniscus
can penetrate several hundred nanometers into a gap between two nanostructures
with such a spacing.23,24 Interestingly, a natural example
showing that deeper channels are required to induce a nonwetting Cassie–Baxter
state was recently discovered on scales of the West African Gaboon
Viper (Bitis rhinoceros). These scales
have a comparable but considerably deeper nanotexture and, as a result,
are superhydrophobic (contact angle of about 160° and negligible
contact angle hysteresis).21

In light
of the wetting and topographical characterization, as well as the
droplet evaporation experiments, the difference in the droplet impact
dynamics of the C. atrox and P. catenifer scales stems predominantly from the
moderate difference in their effective wetting properties, as well
as from the highly pinning nature of the dense nanoridge labyrinth
on C. atrox scales. These topological
features increase the adhesion of both the primary and the secondary
droplets, which enables the accumulation of a substantial amount of
water on the back of the C. atrox.

Finally, with regard to the macroscale structure of the scales of C. atrox, the prominent keel at the center along
its length is speculated to serve several purposes, such as in camouflage.25 From the work we report, the keel might complement
the nanostructure by splitting a droplet and reduce the Weber number.
For example, in our droplet impact experiments, we observed that a
droplet is more likely to split about the keel and disintegrate into
smaller droplets. It is well established that such a macrotexture
can split impinging water droplets, redistributing the mass of the
droplet and therefore significantly reducing the total contact time
between the liquid and the surface.26−28 While the dorsal scales
of gopher snake also have a keel, it is far less prominent and did
not induce any particular interactions with the droplets. Thus, apart
from potentially helping to split some of the impacting droplets,
the keel on the scales of C. atrox appears
at this time unlikely to have a major role in water collection. Nonetheless,
the role of the keel on dorsal scales will require further investigation
in C. atrox and other species that
possess them.

Conclusions
In summary, we explored the role of the
dorsal-scale surface characteristics on the rain-harvesting behavior
of the Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnake (C. atrox). Specifically, we compared wettability, surface texture, and droplet
impact dynamics on the rattlesnake epidermis with those of two unrelated
(control) sympatric snake species (Desert Kingsnake, L. splendida, and Sonoran Gopher Snake, P. catenifer). These two control species are not
known to show rain-harvesting behavior. Our results show that the
scales of C. atrox exhibit the highest
contact angle and have a dense labyrinth-like nanotexture. When interacting
with water, this shallow nanotexture strongly pins the triple-phase
contact line. Using a set of droplet impact tests, we show that the
textured scales are effective in collecting droplets in different
rain-harvesting scenarios reported for this species. Consequently,
it is the nanoscale-scale characteristics that allow the snake to
collect the water droplets on its body for consumption during infrequent
rains in arid climates such as deserts and maintaining a hydrated
state.

Experimental Section
Samples
In this study, we used fresh (minutes-old)
road kills as well as shed skins of the three species of snakes as
our samples: Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnake (C.
atrox; Family Viperidae) and two colubrids (Family
Colubridae), the Desert Kingsnake (L. splendida) and Sonoran Gopher Snake (P. catenifer). The samples were collected on Portal Road in Cochise County, Arizona,
during the spring of 2019. Post collection, they were stored in plastic
bags and placed on ice in an insulating container for 6–24
h duration before being tested. In addition, shed skins of captive
snakes were also analyzed for reference. We did not observe any difference
in texture or wetting dynamics between the two types of snakeskin
samples. To the best of our knowledge, rain-harvesting behavior reported
for C. atrox has not been reported
for the other two species we studied, and thus we use them as our
control samples. Information on body mass, snout-vent, and tail lengths
for the three samples we report here is provided in Table 1.

Droplet Experiments
We built a droplet impact setup
to deliver water droplets of approximately 10 μL volume (diameter
∼2.5 mm). The flow rate of water was controlled using a syringe
pump (NE-2000, New Era Pump Systems). The height of the delivery head
consisting of a syringe tip is kept adjustable to change the Weber
number of the impacting droplets (from a height of 12.5–120
cm). The samples were placed in such a way that the droplets were
mostly landed on dorsal scales. All high-speed imaging was done using
a FASTCAM mini ux100 and Nikon D5200 digital SLR camera. A few portable
banks of light-emitting diode (LED) lights were used for lighting
purposes.

For the droplet evaporation experiments, about 0.5–1
μL droplets were spread over the shed skin samples of C. atrox and P. catenifer. The droplets were allowed to naturally evaporate into the laboratory
environment with a temperature of around 18 °C and a relative
humidity of 10–20%. From qualitative observation, the droplets
evaporated in a constant base area mode until the contact angle decreased
substantially and the contact line was easily accessible using an
optical microscope (Zeiss Axio Zoom V16 with a 10× lens). The
use of the translucent shed skin samples enabled through-sample illumination,
which strongly facilitated imaging. The images were recorded with
a 2 Hz frequency.

To test for the possibility of heterogeneities
in wetting properties of the scales, we also performed simulated fog
collection experiments. Specifically, as in our previous work,29 we directed outflow from an ultrasonic water
fog generator, which is a component of an Electro-tech Systems controlled
humidity chamber, over the samples that were placed under the optical
microscope. In contrast to the distinct heterogeneities observed during
such experiments on some beetle species,4−7 we did not observe any preferential collection
sites.

Contact Angle Measurements
The contact angles of deionized
water on the dorsal scales of the three species were measured using
a Rame-hart 290 goniometer with 15–20 locations studied (30–40
contact angle measurements) per each sample. The indicated uncertainty
corresponds to a standard deviation of the measurements. Since we
did not measure any difference between the scales on the above-described
specimen and the collected shed skins, we performed the more extensive
contact angle measurements using the shed skin samples. To remove
extensive surrounding topological features, the shed skin samples
were cut into about 3–5 mm wide and 2 cm long strips and attached
to a glass slide using double-sided copper tape. The resulting images
were analyzed using ImageJ. Please note that although the ventral
scales of the snakes appear macroscopically smooth, and thus potentially
better sites for contact angle measurements than the dorsal scales,
there are significant differences in microscopic topological features
between these two body locations (see the Supporting Information). Consequently, we only measured contact angles
on the dorsal scales, which are relevant to the rain-harvesting behavior.

Sample Imaging
The optical microscopy was done using
an Axio Zoom V16 (Zeiss) attached with a 10× lens. The SEM images
of the scale surface morphology were obtained using an Amray 1910
FESEM. Either shed or freshly dehydrated scale samples were sputter-coated
with a thin conductive metal layer prior to imaging. The images were
postprocessed in ImageJ for analysis.
