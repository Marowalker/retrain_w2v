Detection of pesticide residues is
important for ensuring food
safety, and it has assumed increased significance. Traditional analytical
methods are known for being destructive and cost- and time-intensive.
In this study, depth-profiling Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic
spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS) was successfully used as an in situ, nondestructive,
and rapid method for detecting tricyclazole residues on three metal
surfaces (copper, aluminum, and iron) and subsequently, on the surfaces
of fresh rice leaves and ripe husks. Four moving mirror velocities,
that is, 0.32, 0.63, 0.95, and 1.90 cm s–1 were
used for recording the spectra. The results indicated that the moving
mirror velocity of 0.95 cm s–1 was optimal for depth
profiling, and the obtained spectra showed a strong absorption band
at around 1200 cm–1, corresponding to the C–N
bond in tricyclazole. This band could be used for monitoring tricyclazole
residues on plant surfaces. Principal component analysis confirmed
the detection of tricyclazole on the basis of its spectral information.
Considering the scanning depth and the thickness of the plant cuticle,
FTIR-PAS can be an effective means for detecting and monitoring similar
organonitrogen pesticide residues.

Introduction
Pesticides, which are agrochemicals, designed
to prevent, destroy,
repel, or mitigate pests,1 have played
a significant role in facilitating the development of agriculture.2 However, their inappropriate and irrational use
has resulted in an increase in the amount of pesticide residues on
plants, vegetables, and fruits, which adversely impact the ecosystem
and human health.3,4 Consequently, many countries began
focusing on pesticide control and detection of pesticide residues,5,6 using a range of analytical techniques such as gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry,7,8 high-performance liquid chromatography,9 enzyme inhibition method,10 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,11 and electrochemistry.12 Despite their
wide usage, these traditional methods are known to be time- and cost-intensive
and require complicated pretreatment processes to facilitate detection.
Therefore, a rapid, inexpensive detection technique is needed.

Infrared spectroscopy is an effective tool for qualitative and
quantitative analysis13 and has already
been deployed for pesticide determination in agrochemical formulations.1,6 Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS),
consisting of a movable mirror whose velocity can be changed, has
been used for depth profiling in a wide range of fields.14−16 The analyte molecules absorb electromagnetic radiation, leading
to local warming, and the thermal expansion generates pressure fluctuations,
which are detected by a sensitive microphone and finally transformed
into spectral data.17−19 The obtained spectrum contains abundant information
about the sample, and the detected signal is proportional to the sample
concentration.14 Armenta et al.15 managed to apply FTIR-PAS for the routine determination
of mancozeb in commercially formulated fungicides, and Liu et al.2 coupled PAS with an artificial neural network
method to nondestructively quantify dichlorvos residues on the apple
cuticle in the near-ultraviolet region. Although there have been few
reports about its application in detecting pesticide residues, FTIR-PAS
in the middle wavelength range shows stronger potential for the quantification
of pesticide residues on the surface of plant cuticles.

The
plant cuticle is the outer protective layer on the surfaces
of aerial plant organs,20 and it is a layered
structure composed of epicuticular wax, intracuticular wax, and cuticle
matrix.21 The main components of cutin
and cuticular waxes are fatty acids, alcohols, aldehydes, alkanes,
esters, and some other lipophilic polymer matrices and soluble cuticular
lipids.22 As a thin, hydrophobic, and flexible
membrane (measuring 0.1–10 μm in thickness), the cuticle
is an efficient barrier against unregulated water loss and pathogen
infection.21 Organonitrogen pesticides,
comprising several nitrogenous compounds, are some of the most universally
administered pesticides because of their low cost, ready availability,
and wide applicability. Tricyclazole is one such fungicide effective
against the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, known to cause the blast disease. It consists of a five-membered
heterocyclic ring with three nitrogen atoms (Figure 1), which forms the basis for determining
organonitrogen pesticides by FTIR-PAS.23

Figure 1 Spectra
of a standard sample of tricyclazole at wavenumber range
of 4000–500 cm–1. The scans were conducted
in the midinfrared with a resolution of 4 cm–1;
the moving mirror velocities of 0.32, 0.63, 0.95, and 1.90 cm s–1 were involved for reference data; accumulating 256
scans per spectrum; a carbon black was used as background.

This study aimed to apply depth-profiling FTIR-PAS
for the detection
of pesticide residues on plant surfaces. Tricyclazole was first sprayed
on the surfaces of three kinds of metal disks and detected using four
moving mirror velocities. After parameter selection and optimization,
pesticide residues were then detected on the surfaces of fresh rice
leaves and ripe husks. Considering the varying thicknesses of plant
cuticles and pesticide residues, depth-profiling FTIR-PAS has opened
up new possibilities for optimally detecting pesticide residues on
plant surfaces.

Results and Discussion
Spectral Investigation
of Tricyclazole
The molecular
structure of tricyclazole (Figure 1) consists of a five-membered N-heterocyclic ring containing
three nitrogen atoms and two double bonds separated by a single bond,
thus constituting a π–π conjugated system. Figure 1 shows the spectra
of the standard sample of tricyclazole scanned at four moving mirror
velocities. The spectral photoacoustic signal (PA signal) of tricyclazole
was higher at lower moving mirror velocities, whereas at higher moving
mirror velocities such as 1.90 cm s–1, the PA signal
was relatively unstable because of strong noise interference.24

Well-resolved peaks in the spectra could
be successfully interpreted. A broad band between 2600 and 3400 cm–1 corresponded to the C–H stretching vibration.25 Two absorption peaks at around 1200 and 1000
cm–1 were assigned to the C–N stretching
vibrations.26,27 A strong peak at approximately
1500 cm–1 resulted from aromatic ring vibrations
overlapping with C=N vibrations.6,26,28 In the fingerprint region of IR, 1000–500
cm–1, a band occurring at around 750 cm–1 was assigned to C–S vibrations.25 The band around 1200 cm–1 emerged invariably and
strongly at all four moving mirror velocities. Consequently, it could
be regarded as the characteristic absorption peak for tricyclazole,
thereby providing the basis for detecting organonitrogen pesticide
residues.

Spectra of Pesticide Residues on the Metal Surfaces
The plant cuticle, which contains low amounts of nitrogen, is a hydrophobic
layer with varied absorptivity to pesticides. In this study, metal
surfaces of copper, aluminum, and iron were chosen to simulate the
plant surfaces for photoacoustic spectroscopy, as they are similarly
hydrophobic and do not contain nitrogen and differentially absorb
pesticides.

Figure 2 shows the spectra around 1400–1000 cm–1 for the copper (Figure 2a,d), aluminum (Figure 2b,e), and iron (Figure 2c,f) disks sprayed with the tricyclazole sample (Figure 2a–c) and deionized
water (Figure 2d–f).
There were several absorption bands for copper disks sprayed with
tricyclazole around 1000–1400 cm–1, including
a strong band located at 1200 cm–1 and some relatively
weaker bands located around 1300 and 1100 cm–1.
The absorption bands of copper disks sprayed with deionized water
appeared at the same wavenumbers, however, with a lower PA signal,
especially around 1200 cm–1. The absorption bands
of aluminum disks sprayed with tricyclazole tended to be similar to
those of copper in terms of their wavenumbers. The absorption bands
at 1300 and 1100 cm–1 sprayed with tricyclazole
emerged to be similar to those sprayed with deionized water in terms
of the PA signal, and similar results were obtained in the case of
iron. We thus concluded that the bands at 1300 and 1100 cm–1 should be assigned to the metal disks and some additives, respectively,
whereas the band at 1200 cm–1 corresponds to the
C–N vibration from tricyclazole. These results establish the
success of the FTIR-PAS method in detecting pesticide residues on
various surfaces with different pesticide absorptivity.

Figure 2 Spectra of
copper (a,d), aluminum (b,e), and iron (c,f) disks sprayed
with a pesticide sample of tricyclazole (a–c) and deionized
water (d–f) at the wavenumber range of 1400–1000 cm–1. The scans were conducted in the midinfrared with
a resolution of 4 cm–1; the moving mirror velocities
of 0.32, 0.63, 0.95, and 1.90 cm s–1 were involved
for depth profiling of the samples; accumulating 256 scans per spectrum;
with 10 repetition scans per sample at different positions to get
an average spectrum; a carbon black was used as background.

Optimization of Moving
Mirror Velocity
The photoacoustic
spectrometer used in this study offers a series of moving mirror velocities
to meet the requirements of different depth profiling. Table 1 shows the profiled depth under
four moving mirror velocities at the range of 1500–400 cm–1. Higher moving mirror velocities resulted in a thinner
scanning depth and higher systematic noise.29 Because of the extremely thin pesticide residues (probably several
micrometers) on the metal surfaces, selecting the most suitable moving
mirror velocity was essential.

b Moving mirror velocities (cm s–1) used
in this study.

The spectra
in Figure 2 indicate
the characteristic absorption band emerging at 1200
cm–1 at the moving mirror velocity of 0.95 cm s–1, whereas the scanning depth was about 5.3 μm.
Therefore, we can infer that the thickness of the pesticide sprayed
on the metal disks was around 5.3–6.5 μm, which corresponds
to the moving mirror velocity of 0.63 cm s–1 at
1200 cm–1.

The scanning depths at the lower
moving mirror velocities of 0.63
and 0.32 cm s–1 were deeper than 5.3 μm, resulting
in the disappearance of the band around 1200 cm–1. The scanning depth at 1.90 cm s–1 was less than
that at 0.95 cm s–1 and should have theoretically
resulted in the appearance of the typical tricyclazole band; however,
the intense systematic noise resulting due to the very fast moving
mirror velocity interfered with the target spectral signal. As a result,
we concluded that 0.95 cm s–1 was the most suitable
moving mirror velocity for the detection of organonitrogen pesticide
residues.

Spectra of Pesticide Residues on the Rice Surfaces
Figure 3 shows the
spectra of fresh rice leaves (Figure 3a,c) and ripe husks (Figure 3b,d) sprayed with the pesticide sample (Figure 3a,b) and deionized
water (Figure 3c,d)
at 1400–1000 cm–1. The higher moving mirror
velocity of 1.90 cm s–1 was excluded because of
the intense systematic noise. The spectra of the rice surfaces sprayed
with deionized water (Figure 3c,d) showed that there was a broad band at around 1100 cm–1 in all three spectra obtained, which is usually attributed
to the Si–O vibrations28 and C–O
stretching modes.30 The spectra obtained
at the three moving mirror velocities slightly differed from each
other, and this could be explained by the inherent variations in the
layered structure of the plant cuticle. A previous study on the characterization
of tomato fruit cuticles by infrared spectroscopy has provided valuable
insights about their chemical composition and structure; in fact,
this layered structure abounds with cutin, wax, and polysaccharide
and does not contain nitrogen.30

Figure 3 Spectra of
fresh leaves (a,c) and ripe husks (b,d) of rice sprayed
with the pesticide sample of tricyclazole (a,b) and deionized water
(c,d) at a wavenumber range of 1400–1000 cm–1. The scans were conducted in the midinfrared with a resolution of
4 cm–1; the moving mirror velocities of 0.32, 0.63,
and 0.95 cm s–1 were involved for depth profiling
of the samples; accumulating 256 scans per spectrum; with 10 repetition
scans per sample at different positions to get an average spectrum;
carbon black was used as the background.

The spectra of rice surfaces with tricyclazole residues (Figure 3a,b) demonstrated
an obvious absorption peak at around 1200 cm–1,
scanned at a moving mirror velocity of 0.95 cm s–1, which was different to the other two spectra scanned at 0.63 and
0.32 cm s–1 velocities. In contrast to the spectra
of the rice surfaces sprayed with deionized water (Figure 3c,d), the bands of all three
spectra around 1100 cm–1 were clearly ascribed to
C–O and Si–O vibrations, but the visible absorption
peak at 1200 cm s–1 with a moving mirror velocity
of 0.95 cm s–1 corresponded to the C–N vibrations
of tricyclazole (Figure 1). Noticeably, there was a slight absorption peak at 1200 cm s–1 at 0.63 cm s–1 in the spectrum
of rice husk with tricyclazole residues (Figure 3b), and the PA signal was lower than the
peak of the spectrum at 1200 cm s–1 at 0.95 cm s–1. One explanation for this observation could be that
the absorptivity of ripe husk to tricyclazole was greater than that
of fresh rice leaves, and thus, there was a greater amount of tricyclazole
residue on the surfaces of the husks. Overall, the results indicate
the success of FTIR-PAS in detecting tricyclazole residues on different
rice surfaces as well.

Principal Component Analysis
Ten
spectra of rice leaves
and ripe husks sprayed with water (group 1) and tricyclazole (group
2) were recorded at the moving mirror velocity of 0.95 cm s–1 Principal component analysis (PCA) and the results showed that the
first three principal components (PC1, PC2, and PC3) of the leaves
(Figure 4a) and husks
(Figure 4b) accounted
for 88.00 and 86.11% of the total variance, respectively. These three
components contained significant information about the spectra of
these samples, and most points of group 2 distributed in this area
differed from those of group 1. Thus, the spectral information between
both the groups differed, and there should be some spectral information
of tricyclazole contained in the spectra of group 2 that could reveal
further evidence of its successful detection on the rice surfaces.

from midinfrared photoacoustic spectra of 10
rice fresh leaves (a) and ripe husks (b) sprayed with water (group
1) and tricyclazole (group 2) under a moving mirror velocity of 0.95
cm s–1.

Some samples were difficult to distinguish with PCA, probably
owing
to the uneven distribution of the pesticide or because the scores
merely contained more information about the original independent variables
but failed to establish any relationship between the independent and
dependent variables.31

FTIR-PAS Scanning
of the Plant Cuticle with Pesticide Residues
As explained
previously and depicted in Figure 5, the plant cuticle is a composite membrane
with a heterogeneous spatial distribution, composed of an epicuticular
wax layer, a cutin-rich fraction within intracuticular waxes, and
phenolic compounds, and is connected to the cell wall by a polysaccharide-rich
fraction30 with a thin layer of about 0.1–10
μm.21 As seen in Table 1, the scanning depth of the
spectrometer at the moving mirror velocity of 0.95 cm s–1 attained 5.3 μm with optimized spectral recording parameters
at 1200 cm–1, which is much smaller than 10 μm.
In cases where there exist little or no pesticide residues, the scanning
is likely to be performed directly on the cuticle layer, and the typical
absorption would not appear at 1200 cm–1. Considering
the thickness of the pesticide residues and cuticle layers, as shown
in Figure 5, it is
possible to optimize the scanning depth according to the specific
plant cuticle, to ensure that the scanning remains in the pesticide
layer, whilst maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio.

wavenumber of 1200 cm–1, 0.32 cm s–1 in blue, 0.63 cm s–1 in green, 0.95 cm s–1 in red and 1.90 cm s–1 in purple.

Materials and Methods
Pesticide and Metal Substrates
A wettable powder of
tricyclazole with an active ingredient of 75% (Yifan Co., China) was
selected as the pesticide and dispersed in distilled water at a ratio
of 1:300 (w/v), which corresponded to the typical value in agricultural
applications. The spectra of the standard tricyclazole sample (Aladdin
Co., USA) served as the reference data.

Three disks made of
copper, aluminum, and iron (diameter 10 mm and thickness 2 mm) were
selected as the metal substrates. These disks were first washed with
dilute hydrochloric acid and distilled water, dried, and then classified
into two groups. One group was sprayed with the tricyclazole suspension,
whereas the other served as a control group and was sprayed with deionized
water. To ensure homogenous spraying on the surfaces, both the suspension
and water were sprayed thrice and through the same atomizer. All disks
were then kept for drying at room temperature and at a relative humidity
of 30% for 24 h.

Rice Leaves and Husk Samples
Fresh
rice leaves and
unhusked rice were randomly selected and divided into two respective
groups each. Similar to the metal disks, the leaves were cut into
disks with a diameter of 10 mm, and the treatment was repeated exactly
as described for the metal disks described above.

Spectra Recording
Photoacoustic spectra for all samples
were recorded using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet
6700, Thermo Scientific, USA) equipped with a photoacoustic cell (model
300, MTEC, USA). The sample was placed in the cell holding cup (diameter
10 mm, height 3 mm), the cell was purged dry using dry helium (5 mL
min–1) for 10 s to ensure a CO2- and
H2O-free environment. The scans were performed in the midinfrared
wavenumber range of 4000–500 cm–1 with a
resolution of 4 cm–1, using four moving mirror velocities
of 0.32, 0.63, 0.95, and 1.90 cm s–1 for depth profiling
of the samples. Two hundred fifty-six scans were accumulated per spectrum,
with 10 repetitions per sample at different positions to get an average
spectrum, and the obtained spectra were normalized against a carbon
black reference.

Data Processing
All obtained spectra
were filtered
using the Savitzky–Golay function (25 points and first polynomial
order filtering) and standardized by the software MATLAB 2016b (MathWorks
Inc., USA). Ten replicates for each sample were averaged by the mean
function of MATLAB 2016b.

The average profiling depths of specific
absorption bands under different modulation frequencies were calculated
using the following function24 1  where μ denotes the thermal diffusion
length, D denotes the leaf thermal diffusivity of
the leaf, D ≈ 10–3 cm2 s–1 for the polymer materials, and f denotes the modulation frequency (Hz), which equals wavenumber
plus moving mirror velocity.
