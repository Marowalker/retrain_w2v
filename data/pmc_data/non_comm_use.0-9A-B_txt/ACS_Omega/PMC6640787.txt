An ab initio calculation based on
density functional theory (DFT)
was used to verify the disordered structure of a novel oxynitride
phosphor host, La4–xCaxSi12O3+xN18–x, with a large unit cell (74 atoms),
low level of symmetry (C2), and large band gap (4.45
eV). Several Wyckoff sites in the La4–xCaxSi12O3+xN18–x structure
were randomly shared by La/Ca and O/N ions. This type of structure
is referred to as either partially occupied or disordered. The adoption
of a supercell that is sufficiently large along with an infinite variety
of ensemble configurations to simulate such a random distribution
in a partially occupied structure would be an option that could achieve
a reliable DFT calculation, but this would increase the calculation
expenses significantly. We chose 5184 independent unit cell configurations
to be used as input model structures for DFT calculations, which is
a reduction from a possible total of 20 736 unit cell configurations
for C2 symmetry. Instead of calculating the total
energy as well as the band gap energy for all 5184 configurations,
we pinpointed configurations that would exhibit a band gap that approximated
the actual value by employing an elitist nondominated sorting genetic
algorithm (NSGA-II) wherein the 5184 configurations were represented
mathematically as genomes and the calculated total and band gap energies
were represented as objective (fitness) functions. This preliminary
screening based on NSGA-II was completed using a generalized gradient
approximation (GGA), and thereafter, we executed a hybrid functional
calculation (HSE06) for only the most plausible GGA-relaxed configurations
with higher band gap energies and lower total energies. Finally, we
averaged the HSE06 band gap energy over these selected configurations
using the Boltzmann energy distribution and achieved a realistic band
gap energy that more closely approximated the experimental measurement.

1 Introduction
We
recently used a conventional solid-state combinatorial search
process in association with metaheuristics strategies to screen a
large selection of oxynitrides in an attempt to reveal novel phosphors
that could be used in white-light-emitting diode (LED) applications.1−3 As a result, we discovered La4–xCaxSi12O3+xN18–x:Eu2+ phosphors,
which will be referred to as LCSON. The crystal structure of LCSON
existed in none of the existing structure types listed in the Inorganic
Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) and was determined to be monoclinic
in the C2 space group, with the following lattice
parameters: a = 18.54268(4), b =
4.840398(11), c = 10.700719(18), β = 108.25660(17),
and the number
of formula units per cell (z) = 2 (ICSD_248802).
The luminous intensity, reliability, and thermal stability of LCSON
were comparable to those of the well-known commercially available
yttrium aluminium garnet phosphors, as shown in Figure S1, which is available in the Supporting Information. Aside from the pragmatically successful functional
performance of the material, a theoretical understanding of this phosphor
is also of great interest.4,5

There have recently
been a growing number of reports regarding
density functional theory (DFT) calculations for luminescent materials
for use in LEDs5−10 to understand their electronic structure and crystal stability.
In this regard, the present investigation was focused on DFT calculations
to theoretically validate the discovery of the novel structure, La4–xCaxSi12O3+xN18–x. A typical x value is around 1.5 and is based
on the Rietveld refinement of a synchrotron light source X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern and a neutron diffraction pattern.2,5 Using
this x value in a feasible input model for DFT calculations
would require special consideration due to the random distribution
of La/Ca and O/N ions. This sort of structure is referred to as either
disordered or partially occupied. In particular, disordered structures
are frequently observed in many luminescent materials for use in LED
applications, such as (Sr,Ba)Si5(O,N)81,9 and CaAlSiN3.10,11 In addition to the
intrinsic disordered structures, the same disorder problem arises
if either a doping or an elemental substitution is of concern. In
this context, we ruled out the Eu2+ dopant from the LCSON
structure in the DFT calculation to avoid further complications.

There have been several strategies devised to handle the disordered
structures in DFT.12−24 From among those strategies, two representative methodologies have
emerged as dominant: virtual crystal approximation (VCA)16−20 and supercell configurational average.21−24 The VCA (i.e., a composite pseudopotential)
has been successful for some alloys and solid solutions that consist
of similar elements in terms of electronic configuration. However,
La and Ca ions, which constitute the disordered arrangement in LCSON,
differ significantly from each other in terms of electronic configuration.
In addition, lanthanide ions, including even the non-f-electron-involved
La, are not handled well by the presently available density functionals25 and are not promising candidates for a composite
pseudopotential with Ca. As a consequence, the VCA approximation along
with the projector-augmented wave function is not recommended for
LCSON. Therefore, a configurational ensemble average approximation
based on Boltzmann energy distribution would be a better option for
LCSON.21−24

We were particularly interested in calculating a reliable
band
gap energy for LCSON. The present investigation was motivated by the
fact that the highest (maximized) calculated band gap energy was still
lower than the experimental value, irrespective of what exchange correlation
functionals were used. Such unreliability in the DFT-based band gap
calculation originates from the fact that the DFT calculation is inherently
concerned with only the ground state. Therefore, DFT systematically
underestimates the band gap, particularly for insulators. From a practical
point of view, it is customary to pursue a maximized DFT-calculated
band gap energy to reach experimental values for inorganic insulator
materials. In fact, several dozens of randomly chosen LCSON configurations
that involved distinct La/Ca and O/N distributions returned calculation
results for total and band gap energies that were more widely scattered
than we had expected. Along with a very high variance, we also had
a calculated band gap energy that was far below the experimental value.
Accordingly, a band gap energy for LCSON that is averaged over randomly
chosen configurations would no longer simulate the experimentally
measured results.

A reasonable configurational average approach,
which is referred
to as the site occupancy disorder (SOD) program, has been successfully
used for several disordered structures.21−24 However, a supercell-based SOD
program was expected to be too computationally demanding for an LCSON
structure, with a large unit cell size, a large number of atoms in
the unit cell, a relatively low symmetry, and a large band gap. The
large unit cell size never allows for the construction of an appropriate
supercell due to unacceptable computational expenses. Although such
a supercell was available, the possible number of configurations (configurational
diversity) would be greater and would lead to more scattered band
gap energies. The low symmetry was also not very helpful due to a
low level of configurational degeneracy. We employed a unit cell model
that still had a higher number of atoms in comparison to that in conventional
supercells that have been used for typical high-symmetry materials,
such as metal alloys and simple high-symmetric inorganic solid solutions.
We systematically treated randomly distributed atoms in the LCSON
unit cell model. As a result, an extremely large number of possible
independent configurations (5184) abide the La4–xCaxSi12O3+xN18–x (LCSON) stoichiometry, with x = 1.5. Obviously,
it would be impossible to independently calculate all of these configurations
using DFT.

It was apparent that the current state-of-the-art
provides no ideal
DFT calculation method to tackle the disorder problem for LCSON-like
materials with a large number of atoms in a large unit cell, low symmetry,
and large band gap. To sort out this problem, however, we employed
a pragmatically reasonable strategy, the so-called selected configurational
ensemble average method, with the assistance of the elitist nondominated
sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II)26 based
on the Pareto optimality principle,27,28 and a small
number of more plausible configurations were selected in a systematic
manner. Owing to NSGA-II, we could significantly reduce the number
of configurations to be considered, and the more computationally demanding
calculation methods, such as a hybrid functional calculation, could
be applied to only a limited number of configurations; thereby, we
accomplished a realistic band gap energy that more closely approximated
the experimental measurement.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 General Approach for DFT Calculation
The exchange correlation
potential used for the preliminary screening
via the NSGA-II iteration was based on the generalized gradient approximation
(GGA), parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)29 in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP5.3).30−33 The projector-augmented wave (PAW) potentials34,35 along with a cutoff energy of 500 eV and a 1 × 4 × 2 k-mesh
was adopted using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme.36 Structural relaxation was implemented for all selected
configurations, with the values for atomic position, lattice parameter,
and symmetry all allowed to vary. This general relaxation was referred
to as a Type I configurational setting. In parallel with the Type
I setting, another NSGA-II iteration was independently implemented
for atomic position refinement except with fixed lattice parameters
and symmetry, wherein the experimentally obtained lattice parameters
and C2 symmetry were adopted. This case was referred
to as a Type II configurational setting, and the additional NSGA-II
result based on the Type II setting is separately presented in the Supporting Information. More details about the
Type I and II configurational settings will be discussed in subsection 2.3. After completing the structural relaxation for
every configuration, the band structure and density of states (DOS)
were also calculated without spin polarization under computation conditions
that were the same as those described above, and finally the band
gap and total energies were evaluated for use as fitness function
values for the NSGA-II iteration.

The GGA-PBE-based NSGA-II
result was compared with the experimental data to select appropriate
model structures for further computation. The actual optical band
gap for LCSON was evaluated as 4.45 eV on the basis of the intersection
of a straight line with the energy axis in the {F(R)hν}2 versus
energy (hν) plot shown in the inset of Figure 1. The absorbance, F(R), was calculated from the diffuse reflectance
data using a Kubelka–Munk equation.37−39 All of the
GGA-PBE-calculated band gap energies were far lower than the experimental
values. To select configurations for use in further computations,
we classified all relaxed configurations that appeared during the
NSGA-II iteration. The highest band gaps were 3 and 3.15 eV for Type
1 and II cases, respectively. Further calculations based on more advanced
exchange correlation functionals should be employed to tackle the
band gap underestimation problems. We adopted only the Type I result
for the further calculations. The reason the Type II result was discarded
will be explained in detail later in subsection 2.3. We selected seven Type I configurations that exhibited relatively
higher band gap energies and lower total energies from all NSGA-II
results. These selected configurations are constituents in the first
and second Pareto frontiers of all configurations that the NSGA-II
iteration produced, which are marked by a red contour in Figure 2.

4.45 eV.

up to the 7th Pareto frontier. Nondominated entries constituting each
Pareto group are interconnected, wherein the first and second Pareto
frontiers are marked as red contours, which were selected for further
HSE06 calculations.

Thereafter, a hybrid
functional involving nonlocal Fock exchange
(HSE06)40−42 was adopted for the chosen configurations to obtain
a more realistic band gap energy. First, these GGA-PBE-relaxed configurations
were used as input model structures and relaxed again in the HSE06
calculation scheme. Subsequently, the DOS and band structures were
also obtained in the HSE06 calculation scheme. The final band gap
energy was calculated as 4.15–4.46 eV when the HSE06 functional
was employed for the relaxed configurations. Although most of them
were still slightly lower than the experimental data, a clear improvement
was observed in comparison with the GGA-PBE calculation. The HSE06
functional is well known to be highly effective in improving the calculated
band gap energy of semiconductors and large-gap insulators.43 In this regard, the hybrid functional (HSE06)
calculation remains to be a universal option for oxynitride insulators.
A complementary option such as an onsite potential (DFT + U44−47 or HSE + U48) approach did not give better
results in comparison to the HSE06 approach for LCSON. Another option
could be meta-GGA calculations, such as a Tran–Blaha modified
Becke–Johnson exchange potential approximation,49,50 which is known to yield band gaps with the accuracy of a hybrid
functional. However, that approach did not yield results as good as
those that HSE06 gave for the LCSON band gap calculation. The GW approach51,52 was not employed because it is not possible to obtain a quasiparticle
band structure for any chosen path through the Brillouin zone by VASP5.3.
Consequently, further calculation was implemented totally on the basis
of the HSE06 hybrid functional scheme.

It should be noted that
we employed a simple GGA-PBE calculation
for a large number of configurations of LCSON that appeared during
the NSGA-II iteration. Thereafter, a limited number of configurations
were chosen out of the NSGA-II iteration results for further calculations
using HSE06 to more realistically estimate the approximate band gap
energies. Because the GGA-PBE-calculated band gap has a linear relationship
with the HSE06-calculated band gap, the high-band-gap configurations
selected from the GGA-PBE calculation also led to a high band gap
in the HSE06 calculation. In fact, we clearly confirmed a linear relationship
between the HSE06- and GGA-PBE-calculated band gaps for LCSON, as
shown in Figure 3.
Consequently, the chosen configurations proved to be the most superior
in terms of GGA-PBE-calculated as well as the HSE06-calculated band
gaps. For a comprehensive understanding of our computation strategy,
all procedures are described in detail via the succinct flow chart
shown in Figure 4.

strategy.

2.2 NSGA-II-Assisted
DFT Band Gap Energy Calculation
for LCSON
As for the partially occupied structure of LCSON,
the La and Ca ions shared the same Wyckoff site in relatively proportional
amounts, as shown in the atomic position table along with site occupancy
in Table S1. The O and N ions also share
several Wyckoff sites. On the basis of the occupancy values for each
of the shared Wyckoff sites, which were obtained via Rietveld refinement
(Table S1), we reasonably distributed 5
La ions, 3 Ca ions, 33 N ions, and 9 O ions in a unit cell model by
obeying the occupancy values of every shared Wyckoff site when constructing
the input structure models. Trivial violations in occupancy were allowed
for each Wyckoff site, but total occupancy fulfilled the stoichiometry
of La4–xCaxSi12O3+xN18–x (LCSON), with x = 1.5. As a result,
the number of plausible configurations was 20 736, which resulted
from the following enumerations: 4C1 (La/Ca1 site) × 4C2 (La/Ca2 site) × 4C2 (N/O1
site) × 4C2 (N/O7 site)
× 4C1 (N/O9 site) × 4C2 (N/O11 site). Because there
could be many duplications, 20 736 was reduced to 5184 by considering
the C2 symmetry, which implies that all of the shared
sites are general sites with maximum multiplicity, 4, due to the C2 symmetry. The DFT calculation for four equivalent configurations
gave exactly the same total energy and also the same band gap energy.
This means that we incorporated all possible independent configurations
for the disordered LCSON structure on a unit cell basis by adopting
the 5184 models. Note that the 5184 initial models actually violated
symmetry principles, which will be discussed in more detail in subsection 2.3.

We took up 5184 input model structures
(configurations) for the DFT calculation of LCSON. Although the C2-symmetry-related degeneracy significantly reduced the
number of configurations to a quarter of the original total number,
it would still be impossible to track down all of these 5184 configurations.
We employed a representative metaheuristics strategy to reduce the
computation burden and select plausible configurations that would
give rise to a more realistic band gap energy as well as a lower total
energy. That is, NSGA-II was employed to implement this selection
task.26 NSGA-II has been successfully utilized
for the discovery of novel phosphors.1−3 Both the total energy
and band gap energy were objective (fitness) functions for the present
NSGA-II iteration. The decision variable designated each configuration
in the entire search space of 5184 different configurations, and each
of the Wyckoff sites in Table S1 was parameterized
on the basis of whether the sharing element (Ca and O ions) occupied
a site of concern; thereby, a vectorized decision variable was used
for the NSGA-II iteration. The total energy could be conveniently
thought of as being indicative of the stability of a given configuration
in place of the enthalpy of formation, as the constituent elements
and their molar fractions of LCSON are fixed for all configurations
in the decision variable space. Thus, the total energy was minimized
in the NSGA-II process. In parallel with the total energy, the difference
in the band gap energy between the calculated and experimentally measured
results was taken as an objective function to be minimized. This implies
that we minimized the total energy and at the same time maximized
the band gap energy during the NSGA-II iteration. The population size
was 16, a tournament selection was adopted, and the crossover and
mutation rates were 80 and 30%, respectively. NSGA-II differs from
a conventional NSGA in that two consecutive generations are merged
to generate the next, which indicates a so-called elitism-reinforced
NSGA-II. Owing to this treatment, NSGA-II converges much faster than
the conventional NSGA.26 A more detailed
description is available in our previous reports.1,2

Figure 5 shows a
plot of band gap energy versus total energy (two fitness functions)
for all generations from the first to the tenth. Each generation consisted
of 16 configurations. The first generation that was chosen stochastically
was a prominent diversity in the calculated band gap energy (0.23–2.53
eV) and total energy (−593.991 to −590.368 eV). The
evidence that evolution took place was conspicuously observed, that
is, the population converged and many identical entries appeared as
it progressed to later generations. The arrow in Figure 5 indicates the evolution direction,
namely, minimizing the total energy and maximizing the band gap energy. Figure 6 shows the relaxed
configurations of the first and last generations viewed in the b direction, along with the total DOS and calculated band
gap energies. Structural relaxation based on the GGA-PBE functional
did not significantly change the LSCON structure and only allowed
small changes: <0.01 Å in lattice size and <0.5° in
lattice angle. Although it was difficult to note an evolutionary trend
in terms of the configurational change, it was easy to detect reduced
diversity such that the number of identical configurations increased
as the NSGA-II iteration progressed to later generations. The duplication
was due to a small search space that included only 5184 entries. Although
this search space size was huge when considering that in the DFT calculation,
it was relatively small in view of a conventional NSGA-II optimization
task. The mean and variance values and the covariance for both the
fitness function values (the total and band gap energies) in the randomly
chosen first generation could be approximated to the true mean and
covariance values for all configurations, as we also obtained similar
mean and covariance values for another random sample consisting of
24 configurations. This means that a very low mean value for a band
gap energy with great diversity could be anticipated for all 5184
configurations. However, the values for the mean and covariance of
later generations were dramatically increased and decreased, respectively.
As far as the band gap energy was concerned, the configurational average
for the entire configuration ensemble did not match well with the
actual experimental value. Instead, selected configurations out of
later generations would be better to obtain a more realistic averaged
band gap energy.

Figure 5 All populations from the first to the tenth generation;
the arrow
indicates the evolution direction.

Figure 6 Configurations of the first and tenth generation viewed in the b direction, along with the total DOS and calculated band
gap energies. The tenth generation includes only seven independent
configurations and their reduplications.

The 10th generation exhibited a remarkable improvement in
both
the total and band gap energies, with a reduced covariance. Therefore,
we confirmed the enhanced band gap energy and reduced total energy
in comparison with those of the randomly chosen first generation.
The arrow in Figure 5 marks the dramatic evolution. Pareto optimality (or Pareto sorting)26,27 is a key idea constituting NSGA-II, which drove the Pareto front
to move in the optimization direction as it minimized the total energy
and simultaneously maximized the band gap energy, while either niche
expansion or maximization of the crowding distance was pursued. In
fact, NSGA-II exerts a better effect when the fitness (objective)
functions trade off of each other, but in our case, the total energy
was parallel with the band gap energy. It is certain that there is
a strong inverse correlation between the total and band gap energies,
that is, the higher the band gap the lower the total energy, with
no trade-off. In this regard, Figure 5 clearly shows that a conspicuous optimization (evolution)
took place in a left-upward direction, as indicated by the arrow,
according to the Pareto optimality principle. We stopped the NSGA-II
iteration at the 10th generation. Ten generations were sufficient
to obtain an acceptable convergence because the NSGA-II iteration
was run in such a small, discrete decision variable space (=search
space) using only 5184 candidates. The maximum band gap energy calculated
on the basis of DFT–GGA appeared at the sixth generation, and
no higher value appeared afterwards.

We gathered all of the
configurations that appeared during the
NSGA-II iteration from the first to tenth generation and Pareto-sorted
them, as shown in Figure 2. It should be noted
that the Pareto sorting shown in Figure 2 was carried out until the 7th Pareto frontier,
with no distinction between generations. Particular attention was
drawn to configurations with higher band gap energies obtained from
the NSGA-II iteration. In this regard, we pinpointed an optimized
sample consisting of the first and second Pareto frontiers, as marked
by the red contour in Figure 2, which had a higher band gap energy and lower total energy.
The seven different configurations in this selected sample were used
in averaging the band gap energy. These configurations used in averaging
the band gap energy constituted a so-called selected configurational
ensemble. We were not interested in an average under the GGA calculation
scheme because the maximum band gap energy value (3 eV) in this ensemble
remained far below the actual value (4.45 eV). The GGA-based DFT calculation
gave a band gap energy that was lower than the actual value for almost
all insulators.43 To improve the band gap
energy calculation, a further DFT calculation scheme was employed.

We executed a hybrid functional calculation (HSE06) involving a
fraction of the exact exchange (Hartree–Fock exchange) potential
for the configurations taken out of the first and second Pareto frontiers
in Figure 2. These
configurations were relaxed in the GGA-PBE calculation scheme and
exhibited a relatively higher level of GGA-PBE band gap energy. On
the basis of a version of the Boltzmann energy distribution that ignores
the vibrational and pressure effects of thermodynamics, as previously
established by Grau-Crespo et al.,22,23 all of the
HSE06-calculated band gap energies in the selected sample could then
be averaged as below 1  where EgAv is the
averaged band gap, Eg(i) is the HES06-calculated
band gap, EConfig(i) is the energy of the ith configuration in
the selected sample, and kB is the Boltzmann
constant. As a result, we could more closely approximate the experimentally
measured band gap energy. The average band gap (EgAv) for this
selected group was 4.26 eV at room temperature. Such an average incorporates
the probability density distribution based on the appearance frequency
in a systematic manner. However, in the case of LCSON, the appearance
frequency of each configuration was assumed to be uniform; thus, the
average based on Boltzmann energy distribution should not significantly
differ from the simple arithmetic mean. The configurational uniformity
was judged on the basis of use of the unrelaxed configuration as an
input model for the NSGA-II iteration, rather than on the use of the
relaxed configuration after DFT calculation. In fact, none of the
relaxed configurations should be the same from a strict point of view.

It should be noted that only a small number of configurations selected
by NSGA-II were used to make a reliable estimation of the band gap
energy of LCSON, and their representativenesses would be acceptable.
The Boltzmann energy distribution-based average over the entire population
would have given a much lower band gap, which would have deteriorated
the representation. Moreover, it was practically impossible to involve
a large number of configurations to evaluate the average because the
use of the HSE06 functional would have given rise to considerable
computational demands. It should be noted that such an enhanced band
gap energy (4.26 eV) almost reached the actual value (4.45). Owing
to this pragmatic method of simulating the band gap energy, it was
possible to more closely approximate the experimental band gap energy
for such a disordered inorganic compound with such a large unit cell
made up of many atoms, a low symmetry, and a large band gap. If we
had restricted the number of configurations, for instance, if only
the first Pareto frontier in Figure 2 had been adopted, then a more reasonable band gap
energy would have been obtained.

As a matter of fact, calculation
of the band structure and DOS
for a specific configuration would make no sense from a strictly theoretical
point of view. However, Figure 7 shows a band structure along with the total DOS for the configuration
that achieved the highest band gap energy in the HSE06 calculation.
This configuration even led to a band gap that was almost identical
(4.46 eV) to the experimental value (4.45 eV). Notwithstanding such
a perfect coincidence, it should be noted that this configuration
is nothing but a constituent in the selected configurational ensemble
and must be regarded as neither an optimized nor an ideal structure
for LCSON.

figure) that gave the highest band gap energy in the HSE06 calculation.

2.3 Limitations
of the Configuration Setting in
Deciding the True Structural Model
Once we chose either the
configurational ensemble average approximation or the VCA approach
for the DFT calculation, we had a pragmatic approximation rather than
an exact theoretical approach. Thus, it was meaningless to wrestle
with crystallographic details and small violations of the core principles
of crystallography. For instance, there was no way to set up a perfectly
reasonable configuration set for the configurational ensemble average
approximation. For the sake of convenience, we adopted two different
configurational setups, as described in the preceding subsection:
Type I and Type II.

The Type II setting did not allow for a
lattice parameter change, and only the atomic positions were allowed
to vary during the structural relaxation. This meant that the atomic
arrangement certainly violated the C2 symmetry, even
when the lattice parameters were preserved as those of a monoclinic
parent structure. It is obvious that the Type II model slightly violated
the crystallographic symmetry principle. This meant that the specific
Ca/La and O/N configurations removed both the twofold rotation and
the C-centered translation symmetries but maintained the monoclinic
structural frame, which implies that the optimum relaxed configuration
should be neither a C2 nor a P1
symmetry but rather a nonexistant symmetry. Surprisingly, however,
the VASP5.3 allows such a slight violation. Thus, we completed the
NSGA-II iteration using a Type II configurational setting and obtained
a very similar result for the Type I setting, wherein the crystallographic
principle was not violated. All Type II calculated results corresponding
to Figures 2, 5, and 6 for Type I are given
in Figures S2 and S3.

In principle,
it would be possible to constitute a P1 symmetry
by allowing variation in the lattice parameters during
the structural relaxation, which refers to the Type I configurational
setting. In fact, we adopted a lattice parameter relaxation for all
configurations during the entire NSGA-II process. As a result, the
lattice experienced very little distortion during the relaxation,
but such a small change definitely constituted P1
symmetry. Despite such completeness that violated no principle, a
minor complication arose when the Type I setting was adopted. Virtual
XRD patterns simulated on the basis of the Type I relaxed structures
deviated slightly from the actual XRD pattern of LSCON, whereas the
simulated XRD pattern obtained from the Type II setting more closely
resembled the experimental XRD pattern, despite the trivial appearance
of additional superlattice peaks. However, it should be noted that
the virtual XRD simulation based on a unit cell configuration model
must not represent the actual structure at all. Consequently, the
Type I setting was considered more significant in the present investigation,
as it violated no principle of crystallography. Thus, the results
from only the Type I setting are displayed in the main text of the
present article, and the results of the Type II settings are presented
in the Supporting Information. As far as
the calculated band gap was concerned, however, both the Type I and
II settings yielded similar results.

With powder XRD- and neutron
diffraction-based refinements, such
an averaged (smeared, partially occupied, or disordered) structure
should be tangible via the composite atomic scattering factor. This
appears to be analogous to the VCA approach involving the composite
pseudopotential. On the other hand, every single configuration belonging
to a configurational ensemble would accept an accurately defined,
and unique, atomic arrangement. Rietveld refinement based on either
XRD or neutron diffraction data can provide nothing but mathematically
adjusted structural information, and the actual structure would be
incomprehensible for disordered materials with a large cell, low symmetry,
and large band gap. The disorder should not be restricted to a unit
cell scale but should instead be extended to a greater scale that
covers a number of cells. Such a situation cannot be simulated by
adopting a single unit cell model, irrespective of the use of either
a configurational ensemble average approximation or a VCA approximation.
However, a supercell approach, which would be only the option, was
also impossible for a large cell with a large number of atoms.

It should be noted that the configuration with a calculated band
gap energy that best matched the experimental value was a virtual
structure that will never be realized via an actual experiment. In
this regard, it is not recommended to argue that this structure is
optimum and scientifically meaningful. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile
to average those well-matched configurations that differ from one
another. In this regard, we suggest a pragmatic strategy to calculate
the realistic band gap energy through DFT calculation for disordered
structures with a large cell, low symmetry, and large band gap, which
we are frequently faced with in inorganic functional materials groups.
Given the current state-of-the-art, no existing strategy can exactly
simulate the band gap energy of such a disordered structure.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we proposed a pragmatic
DFT calculation scheme that
will enable an acceptable band gap energy calculation for disordered
structures with a large unit cell size, relatively low symmetry, and
large band gap. Using the proposed strategy, we successfully calculated
an acceptable band gap energy for a representative disordered LCSON
structure. This strategy involved NSGA-II iterations within a 5184-member
systematically chosen configuration pool and finally pinpointed several
plausible configurations and allowed them to be averaged on the basis
of the Boltzmann energy distribution. The NSGA-II process, which is
a preliminary screening of a large number of configurations, was executed
on the basis of a fast, but inaccurate, GGA-PBE calculation, and the
final configurational average was obtained using a more accurate,
albeit more time consuming, HSE06 calculation, which drove the calculated
results closer to the experimental values. As a result, we calculated
the band gap energy of LCSON to be 4.26 eV, which closely approximated
the experimental value (4.45 eV).
