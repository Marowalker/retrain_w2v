An
environment-friendly method for the chlorination of imidazoheterocycles
has been developed using chloramine-T, a novel chlorinating reagent.
A bunch of C-3 chloro-substituted imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines

synthesis. The major advantages of this system such as wide applicability,

Introduction
The imidazopyridine,
a nitrogen-containing important heterocycle
moiety, has a wide range of biological activities and is found in
several marketed drugs.1,2 This scaffold is also successfully
employed in the field of material science.3,4 As
a consequence, different processes have been reported for the synthesis
and functionalization of imidazopyridine derivatives.5−15 Many efficient methods of important functionalization and various
synthetic strategies of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines from
readily available starting materials have been also developed by our
group.16−27 Diverse substitutions at 3-position of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines induce different pharmaceutical properties. Therefore,
the incorporation of functionality at the C-3 position, which will
be susceptible for further functionalization, is highly desirable.

Aromatic chlorides are an essential group of compounds that are
widely used in organic synthesis as reaction intermediates in various
coupling and substitution reactions for the preparation of natural
products and medicinally active compounds.28,29 Relative stability of the carbon–chlorine bond makes the
aryl chlorides useful structural motifs in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals,
and other biologically active compounds.30−36 In fact, halogenated imidazoheterocycles also belong to a class
of vital building blocks and multipurpose synthons,37−39 which could
be further converted to more complex organic molecules through cross-coupling
reactions and by other substitution reactions.40−44 Conventionally, chlorination of aromatic compounds
has occurred by aromatic electrophilic substitution,45,46 a directed ortho-lithiation–chlorination,47 or the Sandmeyer reaction of anilines.48 However, all of these common methods involve
harsh conditions, long reaction time, and poor regioselectivity. Consequently,
recent efforts have focused on the improvement of new chlorination
methods.49−54 In addition, accessible scheme to furnish 3-halogen-substituted
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines has been rarely reported.55−57 Recently, Jiang et al. exposed a procedure to synthesize 2-halo-substituted
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines using copper catalyst employing
haloalkynes as the source of halogen.58

Moreover, in modern times, organic synthesis has experienced
a
judicious change to a more sustainable progression that avoids the
general use of toxic and hazardous solvents or reagents, vigorous
reaction conditions, or expensive and problematical catalytic systems.
From the viewpoint of Green Chemistry, development of an efficient
solvent-free approach without using transition metal to prepare halogenated
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines from cheap and readily available
starting materials is highly attractive. Based on the running practice
emphasizing on Green Chemistry, it is believed that “the best
solvent is no solvent”. The crucial advantages of solvent-free
reactions are avoiding pollution, price economy, no need of work-up,
easy purification, and incredible increase in the rate with less energy
consumption.59 Herein, we report a operationally
simple, low-cost, room-temperature chlorination reaction using chloramine-T
in neat condition within very short time. Chloramine-T is found to
be an exceptionally proficient chlorinating agent for the synthesis
of 3-chloro-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines under solvent-free
conditions and there is no need of column chromatography for the purification
in most of the cases. No overchlorination is found, and a variety
of functional groups are tolerated. This chlorination technique is
carried out in open air. In short, we have revealed a highly efficient
chlorinating reagent active to imidazoheterocycles in neat condition
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Chlorination
of Imidazopyridines
Results and Discussion
Our investigation was started
with 8-methyl-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (1a) as the model substrate to optimize
the reaction conditions employing 1 equiv of chloramine-T as a chlorinating
reagent and the results are summarized in Table 1. Initially, the desired 3-chloro-8-methyl-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (2a) was obtained in 66% yield when
the reaction was carried out in 1,2-DCE in open air at room temperature
within 5 min (Table 1, entry 1). Then, the reaction was performed in various organic solvents
such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), toluene, ethanol, poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG), dimethylformamide (DMF), and aqueous medium (Table 1, entries 2–7).
Pleasantly, a good yield of the desired product was observed using
water as the reaction medium (Table 1, entry 7). Gratifyingly, the targeted product was
obtained with maximum yield (95%) in solvent-free conditions (Table 1, entry 8). But no
further improvement was observed when the reaction was carried out
for long time and also in the presence of 0.05 mL water (Table 1, entry 9) and at
60 °C (Table 1, entry 10). However, lower yield was obtained under anhydrous condition
(Table 1, entry 11).
No further chlorination occurred at any other position on the use
of excess chloramine-T. The use of p-toluenesulfonamide
also decreased the yield (Table 1, entry 12). The use of N-chlorosuccinimide
(NCS) as a chlorinating agent did not give the desired product under
the present reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 13). So, finally, the use of 1 equiv chloramine-T
in neat condition in ambient air at room temperature was the optimum
reaction condition for the reaction of 1a to afford 95%
yield of the desired chlorinating product 2a within 5
min (Table 1, entry
8).

e With 1 equiv p-toluenesulfonamide.

Under optimized reaction condition,
a variety of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines were treated
under this standard condition to
evaluate the scope and general applicability of the present methodology.
At first, the effect of the substituent on the pyridine ring of imidazopyridine
was studied and the results are summarized in Scheme 2. The imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines
bearing different electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups
like 8-Me, 7-Me, 6-Cl, 6-Br, and 6-CN successfully reacted to give
the desired products in excellent yields (2a–2e). 8-Methyl-2-(p-tolyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine produced the chlorinated product (2f) with 72% yield.

Scheme 2 Substrates Scope of the Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine
Reaction conditions: 0.5 mmol
of 1 and 1 equiv of chloramine-T in neat condition at
room temperature for 5 min in open air.

The
structure of 3-chloro-7-methyl-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (2b) was further confirmed by X-ray
crystallography (Figure 1).61

Figure 1 X-ray crystal structure of 2b (thermal ellipsoids
are drawn at 50% probability level).

Next, the effect of the substituents present at the aryl
group
on 2-position of the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine moiety
was checked (Scheme 3). Simple 2-phenylimidazopyridine as well as imidazopyridines having
substitution on phenyl ring (4-Me and 4-OMe) efficiently reacted to
provide the good yield of the desired products (3a–3c). Halogens are also well tolerated under the present reaction
protocol (3d–3f). Strong electron-withdrawing
group like −NO2 in the phenyl ring also successfully
gave the desired product with a good yield (3g, 76%).
Notably, the marketed drug zolimidine reacted well to give the chlorinated
product in high yield (3h). The imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine with a naphthyl and 2-thiophenyl substituent at the C-2
position also successfully afforded the products (3i and 3j) without any difficulties. Simple imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine and 2-isobutylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine performed
very well in this present reaction process, providing 3k and 3l with 84 and 89% yield, respectively.

Scheme 3 Synthesis
of the 3-Chloroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridines
Reaction conditions: 0.5 mmol
of 1 and 1 equiv of chloramine-T in neat condition at
room temperature for 5 min in open air.

Furthermore,
the applicability of the present methodology on 2-arylbenzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivatives was
investigated (Scheme 4). We were delighted to install the chlorination in these moieties
with good to excellent yields (61–91%). Benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles with electron-donating
−Me and −OMe substituents on the benzene ring afforded
the corresponding C-3chlorinated benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles 5b, 5c, and 5d with 67, 91, and 68% yield, respectively. Furthermore,
C-4 substituent like −Cl on the phenyl ring at the 2-position
of the benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole
moiety efficiently reacted with chloramine-T to produce the respective
C-3 chlorinated benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles derivatives (5d and 5e). The
reaction of 2-(3-nitrophenyl)benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole afforded the expected product in very good yield
(5f, 78%). It was observed that the C-3 chlorinated benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles 5a, 5b, and 5d were obtained along with the
corresponding unreacted 2-arylbenzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivatives under the optimized reaction conditions
(Scheme 4). Next, to
obtain higher yields of the chlorobenzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles, we further optimized the reaction conditions
at high temperature. Here, we have observed that the use of 1.5 equiv
chloramine-T at 80 °C temperature with 4 h reaction time is the
optimized condition to get a significant high yield of all the desired
products (Scheme 5).
But, in any reaction, no higher levels of chlorination, oxidized compounds,
dimeric, or higher oligomeric species were found to be isolated.

Scheme 4 Scope of the Benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles
Reaction conditions: 0.5 mmol
of 4 and 1 equiv of chloramine-T in neat condition at
room temperature for 5 min in open air.

Scheme 5 Scope of
the Benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles
at 80 °C
Reaction conditions: 0.5 mmol
of 4 and 1.5 equiv of chloramine-T in neat condition
at 80 °C for 4 h in open air.

Unfortunately,
some moities such as 1-methyl-1H-imidazole, indole,
phenol, aniline, and 4-anisaldehyde were unreactive
under the present reaction conditions (Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Unreactive Moieties
The gram-scale reaction of the present protocol
was also executed
in the usual laboratory setup using 8-methyl-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (1a) (Scheme 7). The 3-chloro-8-methyl-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine was obtained without significant decrease in
yield, which clearly indicated the practical applicability of the
current methodology.

Scheme 7 Gram-Scale Reaction
We demonstrated the synthetic utility of our synthesized
compounds
in Scheme 8, in particular,
for the selective functionalization of the C–Cl bond and the
preparation of biologically active target moieties. 3-Chloro-8-methyl-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (2a) was found to be a good substrate
for traditional Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions affording 8-methyl-2,3-diphenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (6a) in 70% yield (Scheme 8, eq A).54 More importantly, Cl in 2a could be easily
replaced to construct the C–SCN bond in the presence of NaSCN
furnishing 66% yield of 8-methyl-2-phenyl-3-thiocyanatoimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (6b) (Scheme 8, eq B),15 which
belongs to an important synthetic intermediate for making biologically
active molecules.

Scheme 8 Synthetic Application of 3-Chloro-8-methyl-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine
To understand the possible reaction mechanism, we checked
the reaction
with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl and observed no effect in
the formation of the desired product (Scheme 9).

Scheme 9 Controlled Experiment
Reaction conditions: 0.5 mmol
of 1a and 1 equiv of chloramine-T in neat condition at
room temperature for 5 min in open air.

A
plausible reaction mechanism has been outlined in Scheme 10 on the basis of the experiments
and literature reports.60 The chloramine-T
shows disproportionation reaction in the presence of moisture to dichloro-sulfonamide
or hypochlorous acid which are effective chlorinating agent and the
free sulfonamide. Then, a rapid nucleophilic attack by imidazopyridine
to Cl+ cation constructed the targeted product (2a).

Scheme 10 Possible Reaction Pathway
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully developed
an environmentally
benign, efficient, and regioselective methodology for the chlorination
of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines at room temperature. The
proposed method accepts a broad substrate scope applicability and
allows a wide range of functionality. This technique is also capable
of chlorinating the benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles. General applicability, easy accessibility of reagents,
operational simplicity, clean reaction, easy purification technique,
open-air and metal- and solvent-free, environment-friendly reaction
conditions, and high yields are the notable advantages of the present
protocol. These features make this convenient practice to be a green
synthetic strategy. We believe that this “green” path
will gain a much more attention in organic synthesis and academic
and industrial field as a powerful and economical route for the chlorination
of imidazoheterocycles.

Experimental Section
General Information
1H NMR spectra were
determined on a 400 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3 solution.
Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million (δ) and are
referenced to tetramethylsilane as an internal standard and the signals
were reported as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), m (multiplet),
dd (doublet of doublets), and coupling constants J were given in Hz. Proton-decoupled 13C{1H}
NMR spectra were recorded at 100 MHz in CDCl3 solution.
Chemical shifts are referenced to CDCl3 (δ = 7.26
for 1H and δ = 77.16 for 13C{1H} NMR) as internal standards. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was
monitored with an aluminum backed silica gel 60 (HF254)
plates (0.25 mm). Silica gel (60–120 mesh) was used for column
chromatography. Petroleum ether (PE) refers to the fractional boiling
in the range of 60–80 °C unless otherwise mentioned. All
solvents were dried and distilled before use. Commercially available
substrates were freshly distilled before the reaction. All reactions
involving moisture-sensitive reactants were executed using oven-dried
glassware. The X-ray single-crystal data were collected using a Mo
Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation with a charge coupled
device area detector.

General Experimental Procedure (for 2, 3, and 5)
A 1 equiv
of chloramine-T (114 mg)
was mixed with 1 (4) (0.5 mmol) in an oven-dried
reaction tube. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 5 min in ambient air. After the completion of the reaction (TLC),
the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (EA, 10 mL)
and the unwanted materials were filtered out. The crude residue was
obtained after the evaporation of the filtrate in vacuum and was purified
by either direct recrystallization from hot ethanol (3 mL) or column
chromatography on a silica gel (60–120 mesh) using petroleum
ether as the eluent to afford a pure product.

Typical Experimental Procedure (for 6a)
To
a solution of 3-chloro-8-methyl-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (2a) (121 mg, 0.5 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (3
mL) were added phenylboronic acid (91 mg, 0.75 mmol), potassium carbonate
(207 mg, 1.5 mmol), and water (2 mL). The reaction mixture was degassed
with argon for 5 min. Bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride
(35 mg, 0.05 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to
80 °C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature
and the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue
was dissolved in ethyl acetate (15 mL), extracted with water (10 mL),
and washed with brine (10 mL). The combined organic layers were dried
(Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo.
Purification by flash column chromatography gave 8-methyl-2,3-diphenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (6a).
