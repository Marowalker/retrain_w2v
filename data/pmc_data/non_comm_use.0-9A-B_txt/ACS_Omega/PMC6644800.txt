Radziszewski amidation,
namely the peroxide-mediated conversion
of nitriles into amides, is a chemiluminescent reaction involving
singlet oxygen. Its increasing relevance in green chemistry and analytical
chemistry makes it an important subject to be discussed in advanced
chemistry courses. To turn the attention of lecturers, teachers, and
students toward this reaction, the history of its discovery as well
as its practical applications is discussed. Moreover, a simple and
effective experiment to demonstrate the chemiluminescent properties
of Radziszewski amidation is provided.

1 Introduction
The amide functional group
is widespread in nature and of fundamental
importance in chemistry, as it determines the physicochemical properties
of countless biological as well as artificial molecules. The formation
of amide bonds is one of the most important and studied reactions
in organic chemistry. One major family of compounds that contain amide
bonds is proteins. Poly(amides) are also a fundamental class of polymers
with countless applications (think, e.g., of nylon-66). It is estimated
that more than 25% of all drugs contain at least one amide bond: amidation
plays a crucial role in the synthesis of important drugs such as the
analgesic acetaminophen, the local anesthetic lidocaine, the antihypotensive
agent midodrine, the antibiotics loracarbef and cefpiramide, the antiarrhythmic
agent procainamide, and so on.

Because of the tremendous significance
of amide formation in synthetic
chemistry, methodological research has focused on efficiency and selectivity,
and these have reached impressive levels. However, the unacceptable
amounts of waste produced have led the ACS GCI Roundtable to label
“amide bond formation avoiding poor atom economy reagents”
as the most pressing target for sustainable synthetic method development,1,2 urging the search for alternative synthetic protocols.

Here,
a promising amidation reaction will be discussed: it is based
on hydrogen peroxide, requires very mild conditions, generates no
waste (water and oxygen being the only byproducts), and it was already
discovered in the 19th century. In 1885, Radziszewski reported that
the synthesis of amides could be afforded in good yields through the
base-catalyzed hydrolysis of aromatic nitriles in the presence of
alkaline hydrogen peroxide at 40 °C.3 Since this seminal report, the reaction, which was called “Radziszewski
amidation”, has been studied, extended, and improved.

The basic mechanism of the reaction was initially formulated as
in eq 1 1  Wiberg, in the 1950s, as he was studying
the reaction of benzonitrile with mildly alkaline hydrogen peroxide,4,5 found that the rate-determining step was the reaction of hydroperoxide
HOO– with the carbon atom of the nitrile group to
give a reactive intermediate, peroxycarboximidic acid (eq 2). The latter would oxidize another
molecule of hydrogen peroxide by a successive fast reaction, producing
the amide (eq 3). 2   3  It was postulated that the reaction of hydroperoxide
with nitriles under controlled pH conditions (pH ∼ 8) generated
short-lived peroxyimidate anions from peroxycarboximidic acids. As
the species are too reactive to be isolated, their involvement in
the reaction was demonstrated only in 1996 by means of infrared spectroscopy.6

The excellent oxidizing power of peroxycarboximidic
acid was soon
recognized, and in 1960, Payne demonstrated7,8 that
benzeneperoxycarboximidic acid, obtained from benzonitrile under the
conditions for Radziszewski amidation, can be useful for the epoxidation
of alkenes (Payne epoxidation), another key research area in green
chemistry.2

Noteworthily, Radziszewski
himself described one of the first chemiluminescent
organic reactions, that is, the oxidation of 2,4,5-triphenylimidazole
(lophine)9 in alcoholic potash when shaken
in the presence of air and the consequent emission of green light.10 However, the emission of light arising from
the nitrile–hydrogen peroxide system went unnoticed, because
it was too weak to be observed by the naked eye. Chemiluminescence
is defined as the emission of light from chemical reactions at ordinary
room temperatures.11 The oxidation of 3-aminophthalhydrazide
(luminol), giving a characteristic blue light, is one of the most
common examples of these kinds of reactions.12 The relevance of chemiluminescent reactions is broad and attracts
interest in many different fields, including (bio)analytics,13−16 photochemistry,14 and organic chemistry;17,18 finally, these reactions have a special role in chemical education
as “exocharmic”, i.e., visually exciting demonstrations.19

In 1964, McKeown and Waters were able
to observe, using a photomultiplier,
an emission of light from the acetonitrile–H2O2 system and to relate it to the generation of singlet oxygen 1O2, an excited state of molecular oxygen.20 The intensity, duration, and spectral components
of the chemiluminescence were found to be strongly dependent on the
nature of the nitrile used as a substrate.

The relaxation of
singlet oxygen to the ground state can occur
with the emission of photons at 633 and 703 nm, the so-called “dimol
chemiluminescence”. This was recently observed and reported
as spectroscopic evidence for singlet oxygen generation during the
reaction of acetonitrile with alkaline hydrogen peroxide.21 However, singlet oxygen can be produced in several
other ways, such as physical (e.g., by photosensitization22), chemical (e.g., by the chlorine–hydrogen
peroxide system23 or by the Trautz–Schorigin
reaction24), and biochemical (e.g., by
myeloperoxidase in leukocytes25).

The reaction of acetonitrile with hydrogen peroxide is a typical
example of ultraweak peroxide-induced chemiluminescent reactions,
which are now under study for the development of new analytical assays.26 These are based on the ability of singlet oxygen
to transfer its energy to other species, which, in turn, can emit
light. Tetracycline antibiotics,27 melatonin,28 and other indole-containing molecules29 are known to increase the intensity of the light
emitted during the peroxide-mediated oxidation of acetonitrile, which,
however, can only be measured using a photomultiplier. A brighter
light, clearly visible by the naked eye, can be obtained by the addition
of luminol.

2 Results and Discussion
The reaction
of acetonitrile with basic hydrogen peroxide produces
acetamide and singlet oxygen, whose chemiluminescence is, however,
too weak to be observed by the naked eye. Luminol can react with singlet
oxygen, emitting, in turn, a characteristic blue light.30 Since the chemiluminescence of luminol is nonspecific,
i.e., it can be induced by different oxidants, the role of singlet
oxygen in the light-emission step can be proved by its selective deactivation
with proper scavengers. The addition of 10 mM ascorbic acid completely
quenches the chemiluminescence, but this cannot be considered as crucial
evidence of singlet oxygen formation as ascorbic acid is a generic
scavenger of radicals (it is known that luminol radical is involved
in the light-emission step31) and reactive
oxygen species.32

Furfuryl alcohol
is a renowned specific scavenger of singlet oxygen,
with which it can react generating a mixture of oxidation products,
whose nature and relative yields vary with respect to the solvent
employed: Scheme 1 shows
the structures of the products that, according to the literature,
are expected to form in aqueous solution.33

Scheme 1 Structures of Products Obtained by the Reaction of Furfuryl Alcohol
with Singlet Oxygen in Aqueous Solution
Interestingly, the addition of up to 0.1 M furfuryl alcohol
to
the chemiluminescent solution only reduces, instead of quenching,
the emission of light. This suggests the involvement of another reactive
species. On the other hand, immediate and complete quenching of chemiluminescence
can be obtained by the addition of 10 mM tiron, an efficient quencher
of the superoxide anion radical O2•–.34,35 It is known that superoxide can originate
from singlet oxygen because of quenching mechanisms,36 and the role of the former to promote the chemiluminescence
of luminol has already been reported.37 The overall mechanism can be represented according to Scheme 2:

3 Conclusions
Radzsiszewski amidation
recently started to gain importance both
as a synthetic tool for green chemistry and for the development of
chemiluminescent assays. Despite its relevance, however, this subject
is not usually covered even in advanced chemistry courses. To turn
the interest of researchers, lecturers, and students toward this topic,
an account of Radziszewski amidation from its discovery back in the
19th century to its latest applications was given here, together with
an easy-to-perform chemiluminescent demonstration.

Rather than
as a stand-alone subject of an advanced-level analytical
or organic chemistry course/laboratory, the Radziszewski amidation
could be used as a starting point to introduce topics ranging from
green synthetic approaches in organic chemistry to the development
of chemiluminescence-based methods in analytical chemistry and to
singlet oxygen in physical chemistry.

The simple procedure described
can be used as a starting point
for the development of students’ laboratory activities as well
as research projects. A systematic study of how different variables
can affect the light-emission step, such as solvent (singlet oxygen’s
lifetime is known to be longer in deuterium oxide compared to water38), alkali (e.g., bicarbonate could be used instead
of carbonate39), temperature, and the nature
and concentration of the nitrile substrate, could be the subject of
an organic/physical chemistry laboratory. The remarkable effect that
ketones have been reported to have on this kind of reaction might
also be an interesting subject of investigation.40 The possibility to record the luminescence spectra would
be significantly advantageous to better compare the results. The chemiluminescence
of luminol has a spectrum that extends from roughly 300–500
nm, with a maximum at approximately 445 nm.37 A simple yet effective method to demonstrate it, without the need
of dedicated instrumentation, is to use a blue filter. This can be
easily realized with methyl orange, an azo dye of common use as a
pH indicator. On observing the reaction through an aqueous solution
of methyl orange, no chemiluminescent emission should be detected
because it absorbs light in the same wavelength range.41 A control experiment could be done using an
aqueous solution of methylene blue, which has a negligible absorption
between 350 and 500 nm: in that case, the blue light would not be
blocked and thus would be visible.42

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Hazards
Concentrated
(30 wt %) hydrogen
peroxide is toxic and corrosive, causes severe skin burns and eye
damage, is harmful if swallowed, and may be harmful if inhaled. It
is a strong oxidizer, which may cause fire or explosion. Commercial
diluted (3 wt %) hydrogen peroxide is less hazardous and can be used
as well. Sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide are corrosive. Luminol
is an irritant. Acetonitrile is toxic. Furfuryl alcohol is an irritant
and a permeator. Tiron (disodium 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonate)
is an irritant. Protective gloves and goggles are mandatory. Reaction
products should be properly disposed.

4.2 Materials
Concentrated hydrogen peroxide,
sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, luminol (3-aminophthalhydrazide),
acetonitrile, ascorbic acid, tiron, and furfuryl alcohol were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. The following stock solutions should be prepared
in advance and used within a day for best results: 0.1 M H2O2 (1 mL of 30 wt % H2O2 diluted
to 100 mL with water or 10 mL of 3 wt % H2O2 diluted to 100 mL with water), 0.1 M Na2CO3 (10.6 g of anhydrous Na2CO3 dissolved in 1
L of water), and 10 mM luminol (1.8 g of luminol dissolved in 1 L
of 0.1 M NaOH).

4.3 Demonstrating the Luminol-Enhanced
Chemiluminescent
Emission from Radziszewski Amidation
In a 50 mL flask, 2.5
mL of 0.1 M H2O2 is mixed with 12.5 mL of 0.1
M Na2CO3 and 0.75 mL of the 10 mM luminol solution.
The room is darkened, and then 10 mL of acetonitrile is added at once:
immediately, an intense blue chemiluminescence develops and remains
visible for more than 10 min. In the absence of luminol, no light
emission can be observed by the naked eye.

Different scavengers
are added in the reaction mixture either immediately before or after
the onset of light emission to demonstrate their action. The following
amounts are to be added to the reaction mixture to obtain a final
10 mM scavenger concentration: 45 mg of ascorbic acid, 81 mg of tiron,
or 23 μL of furfuryl alcohol.
