An asymmetric mechanism
for correlated motion occurring in noninteracting
pairs of adjacent orthogonal 1,4-bis(carboxyethynyl)bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane
(BCP) rotators 1 in the solid state is unraveled and
shown to play an important role in understanding the dynamics in the
crystalline rotor, Bu4N+[1–]·H2O. Single crystal X-ray diffraction
and calculation of rotor–rotor interaction energies combined
with variable-temperature, variable-field 1H spin–lattice
relaxation experiments led to the identification and microscopic rationalization
of two distinct relaxation processes.

Introduction
A recent investigation
of a hybrid system of molecular conductors
and molecular rotors based on 1,4-bis(carboxyethynyl)bicyclo[2.2.2]octane
(BCO) rotators 2 (Scheme 1) identified the phenomenon of quantum dissipation
as a possible channel for severely impeding the rotational motion
in the metallic state above the metal–insulator transition
where the carriers become localized.1 Extending
this nascent class of materials to 1,4-bis(carboxyethynyl)bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane
(BCP) rotators21 requires
the synthesis (Supporting Information)
of Bu4N+[1–]·H2O from its parent biscarboxylic acid for this counter-anion
to be engaged as an electrolyte in electrocrystallization experiments
with π-conjugated electron donors. Here, we analyze the X-ray
structure and dynamics of Bu4N+[1–]·H2O by means of variable-temperature
variable-field 1H spin–lattice relaxation experiments
coupled to rotor–rotor interaction energy calculations. In
the course of this work, we discovered a new mechanism for correlated
motion3−5 in a pair akin to a choreography performed by a duo
of ballet dancers who take turns to be similar to the more static
solid anchor, supporting an agile, faster-moving, less-constrained
partner. We thereby provide a valuable insight6 into an asymmetric motion of geared molecular units whose axles
are orthogonal, that is, offset in a way that makes such an unexpected
choreography nonintuitive. For example, once the mechanism of correlated
motion in strongly coupled pairs of parallel BCO rotators was deciphered
in 3,4 the proper synchronous
gear-like motion, as well as the occasional asynchronous gear-slippage,
seemed intuitive enough; likewise for the correlated motion in the
pairs of significantly more weakly coupled parallel BCP rotators in 4.5

Results and Discussion
One Single
Site: Two Equilibrium Positions
The structure
of Bu4N+[1–]·H2O (Figure 1) displays two salient features: the occurrence on one single crystallographic
site of two equilibrium positions, with unbalanced occupancies of
BCP rotators that slightly change from 0.71 and 0.29 at 180 K to 0.83
and 0.17 at 100 K with no evidence for a phase transition in between,
and the presence of pairs of fast rotors despite their rather unusual
configuration characterized by orthogonal axles. The pairs of rotors
are located far apart in the lattice and do not interact directly.

Hydrogen-bonded water molecules impose the orthogonal configuration

interactions, respectively. Both the majority (0.71) and minority
(0.29) occupancy positions (darker and lighter atoms and lines, respectively)
of the BCP rotators in dynamic equilibrium in the lattice are represented.

Two Rotational Barriers;
Higher Energy Barrier Unexpectedly
Assigned to the Motion of Majority Rotors
Two distinct relaxation
processes have been identified (Figure 2) by variable-temperature 1H spin–lattice
relaxation time experiments conducted as described previously on a
static crystalline powder at two field strengths.1,4,5,8 Note that one
single relaxation process is typically associated with one single
rotor site in the lattice, eventually with several equilibrium positions,
for example, as in 5.8 The
occurrence of two 1H spin–lattice relaxation processes
in crystalline rotors has been associated with either one of the two
cases: when rotors sit at two different crystallographic sites as
in BIBCO7 and [nBu4N+]2[2][2–]2;1 or as in 3 and 4, and when a pair of rotators, each sitting
at a single site with two equilibrium positions with different occupancies,
undergo correlated synchronous motion and occasional asynchronous
events, where the difference in energy barriers scales with the strength
of their interaction. Note in Figure 2, the perfect fit of T1–1(T) data to the Kubo–Tomita
curve for two different rotation barriers, with activation energies Ea1 = 823 K (1.63 kcal mol–1) and Ea2 = 990 K (1.97 kcal mol–1); the attempt correlation times τ1 = 5.6 × 10–13 s and τ2 =
4.4 × 10–13 s, respectively; and an I2/I1 = 2.8 ratio
of intensities of the two relaxation peaks. This I2/I1 value matches the ratio
(0.71/0.29 = 2.45) of the unbalanced occupancies on the single crystallographic
site, providing an unambiguous experimental assignment of the higher
and lower energy barriers to the motion of rotators in the majority
and minority configurations, respectively. C–H···H–C
contacts being shorter in ma–ma pairs (see Figure 3), could be taken as supporting
such an assignment. However, this experimental evidence is puzzling,
because majority–majority (ma–ma) pairs must be more
stable than majority–minority (ma–mi) pairs, with mi–mi
pairs being the least stable. Here, on the contrary, the ma–ma pair is associated with shorter C–H···H–C
interactions, and its two BCPs contact each other the most so that
it should be the least stable (in addition, note that their C–H···O
contacts are longer).

and blue solid lines represent the fit of the data to the Kubo–Tomita
formula, τc = τ0 exp(Ea/kT), yielding Ea1 = 823 K (1.63 kcal mol–1) and Ea2 = 990 K (1.97 kcal mol–1), respectively, and the attempt correlation times of τ1 = 5.6 × 10–13 s and τ2 = 4.4 × 10–13 s, respectively.

(ma−mi), and minority−minority (mi−mi) configurations
given by the crystal structure (Figure 1).

Scheme 1 Rotor–Rotor Interaction
Energies
To understand
the origin of these two barriers and solve this puzzling experimental
assignment, we need calculations of rotor–rotor interaction
energies. As in previous studies,1,4,5,8 density functional theory
calculations were carried out (Supporting Information) to estimate the rotational barriers searching for the lowest energy
paths by means of partial geometry optimizations, starting from the
ma–ma and ma–mi configurations given by the crystal
structure (Figure 3). The terminal groups C≡C–CO2– and C≡C–CO2H were maintained fixed at their
crystallographic positions; geometry optimizations were conducted
in two ways, as exemplified in Figure 4. We next analyzed the energy profiles (Figure 4) computed for the different
rotational motions of the majority and minority rotators in the pairs.

Figure 4 (A) Two
protocols for the geometry optimization: Either (i) θ1 is given a set value and the geometry of the three blades
of each rotor is optimized or (ii) θ1 and θ2 are given set values to impose a motion of both rotors (see
text), and the geometry is optimized. The computed energy profiles
for the ma–ma (B) and ma–mi (C) pairs of BCP rotators
(see the text for a detailed explanation).

When the motion of the atoms of the three blades of each
rotator
was optimized with only one constraint (either θ1 or θ2 is fixed at different values), the curves
denoted ma–ma II, ma–mi II (θ of the ma rotor
is the constraint), and ma–mi III (θ of the mi rotor
is the constraint) exhibit a very irregular profile. This was unexpected
and contrasted sharply with the results of our previous calculations
for the pairs of rotators with parallel axles, where the rotational
profiles typically exhibit the 60° periodicity expected for an
ideal case. Only ma–ma I and ma–mi I, calculated with
the constraint θ1 = θ2, show some
degree of periodicity. Also, in contrast with the cases of the parallel
rotators studied earlier, it was not possible to understand the shape
of these profiles by considering only the evolution of the C–H···H–C
interactions between rotators, suggesting that they are not the only
contributors to rotational barriers when the rotator axles are orthogonal.
Instead, interactions between the hydrogen atoms of the rotator blades
and the oxygen atoms of the carboxylic groups may become relevant
and should also be taken into account. However, even when the evolution
of both C–H···H–C and C–H···O
distances along the rotational motion associated with hydrogen atoms
of the rotators were accounted for, it was not possible to rationalize
the calculated profiles. We checked that the C–H···H–C
interactions between rotator blades and Bu4N+ are long and similar and that the H2O linker molecules
do not make short contacts with the hydrogen atoms of the rotators.

Directionality of the C–H···O Interactions
in a Pair Is the Key to the Mechanism of Motion
To make progress,
we must return to the crystal structure and consider the differences
between the ma–ma, ma–mi, and mi–mi configurations.
Consideration of neither the C–H···H–C
nor the C–H···O contacts provides an understanding
of the stability order. Taking a closer look at the directionality
of the C–H···O interactions in a pair (red-dotted
lines in Figure 1B),
we found that the lone pairs of the oxygen atoms are not far from
a tetrahedral local geometry so that for a given H···O
distance, the interaction will be stronger when C–H points
toward one of these lone pairs, that is, when C–H···O
and H–O···H angles are as close as possible
to 180° and 109°, respectively. With this in mind, we then
realized that although in the ma–ma configuration the H···O
distance is somewhat longer, its orientation is considerably better
(H–O···H = 106.5°; C–H···O
= 160.6°) than that in the mi–mi configuration (H–O···H
= 116.9°; C–H···O = 135.7°). We thus
conclude that the directionality effect of the C–H···O
interaction overrides the effect of the slightly longer H···O
distance and stabilizes preferentially the majority configuration.
Ultimately, a trade-off between C–H···H–C
and C–H···O interactions leads to an unbalanced
71:29 occupancy between the majority and minority configurations in
dynamic equilibrium in the lattice. In fact, our calculations led
to a very slight 0.1 kcal mol–1 preference for the
ma–ma configuration. This value should be taken with a grain
of salt because it is a result of competing weak effects, yet it would
be consistent, with a slight underestimation of the H···O
interaction in our calculation.

Taking into account both the
distance and orientation of C–H···O interactions
as well as C–H···H–C contacts, the detailed
structural evolution of the pairs of rotors along the rotational profiles
can be understood. With no structural restriction imposed in the calculations,
one C–H···O interaction is essentially maintained
unchanged (see, for instance, the structural reorganization along
the rotational motion for ma–ma II in the Supporting Information Figure S1), whereas the other C–H···O
interaction and C–H···H–C interactions
evolve during the rotation. In other words, the blades of one rotator
barely move whereas those of the other rotate, severely disrupting
its own C–H···O interaction. A majority rotor
is maintained practically unchanged in the calculated paths for ma–ma
II and ma–mi III, but the minority rotor is blocked in ma–mi
II. In contrast, neither of the two rotors is blocked along the paths
for ma–ma I and ma–mi I. For ma–ma pairs, the
two rotational motions are almost identical (1.30–1.35 kcal
mol–1). In contrast, for ma–mi pairs, the
asymmetric motion is clearly advantageous; when the mi rotor is blocked
(ma–mi II), the activation barrier (1.45 kcal mol–1) is not far from the previous ones, but when the ma rotor is blocked
(ma–mi III), the barrier is definitely lower (1.08 kcal mol–1).

In a ma–mi Pair, It Is the Minority
Rotor That Is Moving
Faster
To summarize, we can now understand the mechanism
of motion as well as the experimental assignment based on the ratio
of intensities of the two T1–1 peaks. For asymmetric motions in a ma–mi pair, it is the
minority rotor that is moving faster because its C–H···O
interaction is initially weaker on account of its misalignment with
the ma oxygen lone pair, that is, its barrier is slightly smaller.
In contrast, the barrier for a majority rotor either in ma–ma
or ma–mi pairs is slightly larger because its C–H···O
interaction is initially somewhat stronger. In addition, when both
rotors move in a pair, the barrier for the ma–ma pair is again
of the same order as those for asymmetric motions of the ma rotor,
whereas for the ma–mi pair, it is larger (1.95 kcal mol–1) by a sizeable margin. This explains why the ratio
of intensities of the two T1–1 maxima associated with the experimental barriers is almost identical
to the ratio of occupancies of the two rotator equilibrium positions
in the crystal structure. In short, the perpendicular orientation
of the two rotors in a pair brings about a radically different rotational
motion compared with all previously studied BCP- and BCO-based solids
with pairs of parallel rotators.
