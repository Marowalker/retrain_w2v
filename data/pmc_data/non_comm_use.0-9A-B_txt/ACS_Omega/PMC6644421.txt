New functionalized tris(2′,6′-difluoro-2,3′-bipyridinato-N,C4′)iridium(III) ((dfpypy)3Irs) complexes,
including small molecules and their dendrimer embedded analogoues,
were synthesized and characterized. It is demonstrated that both the fac-(dfpypy)3Ir-based polyphenylene dendrimers
and (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl (TIPSE)-substituted (dfpypy)3Ir complexes induce large bathochromic shifts (∼50 nm) of
emission bands compared with fac-(dfpypy)3Ir. This is due to the pronounced 3π–π*
character of emissive excited states and the extended conjugation.
A further remarkable feature is the small bathochromic shift of the
emissions of fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium (fac-(ppy)3Ir)-based polyphenylene dendrimers
when compared to those of the iridium (Ir) complex core. Obviously,
the triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer makes emission less sensitive
to extended conjugation than the 3π–π*
transition. This finding suggests new concepts for designing blue
phosphorescent dendrimer emitters. Both the dendrimers and the TIPSE-substituted
(dfpypy)3Ir complexes represent new green and the trimethylsilyl-functionalized
(dfpypy)3Ir new blue phosphorescent emitters. Incorporation
of TIPSE moieties into the ligands of iridium complex gives rise to
enhanced phosphorescence.

Introduction
Phosphorescent emitters
(PEs) such as iridium (Ir) and platinum
(Pt) complexes have been intensively investigated since the first
report on PE-based organic light emitting diodes (OLED) by Baldo et
al. in 1998.1−5 PEs could provide much higher efficiencies than conventional organic
singlet fluorophores because the former generates both singlet and
triplet excitons in devices (corresponding to 100% internal quantum
efficiency and around 20% external quantum efficiency (EQE) theoretically).1−8 Significant improvements of red,9 green,10 blue,11−13 and white14 OLEDs based on small-molecule PEs have been achieved so
far and all have reached or passed 20% EQEs. PEs have also received
attention in applications such as photocatalysis,15−17 chemical sensors,18,19 solar cells,20,21 and biolabeling,22 due to their intriguing photophysical properties.

The neat films of PEs are prone to undergo severe self-quenching.23−27 Therefore, the emitters (also called dopants) are usually incorporated
into a matrix to ensure high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs).
The matrix composed of host materials, e.g., 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl, serves as medium for
charge transport and energy transfer to the dopants.6,28−30 However, these devices based on small molecules still
suffer from expensive ultra high vacuum fabrication and inhomogeneous
distribution of the dopants in the matrix. Dendrimers can overcome
these problems because of their good film formation and generation-by-generation
site-specific functionalization.31−35 In a rigid and structurally well-defined dendritic
molecule, the core can be a phosphorescent emitter while the surface
is functionalized with host moieties. Thus, the ratio between the
hosts and dopants and their positions are accurately controlled in
a dendritic structure.32,33 There have been many studies
on dendrimer-based phosphorescent emitters, especially green and red
ones, since the pioneering work of Samuel and Burn et al. in 2001.35−43 So far, very few blue PEs were reported and they all suffered from
poor color purity and/or low efficiencies.44−48 Accordingly, it is worthwhile to develop high-performance,
dendrimer-based blue PEs.

Shape-persistent polyphenylene dendrimers
(PPDs) as emitters have
been widely studied.49−54 Core and surface-functionalized, first-generation PPDs were shown
to improve OLED performance through the shielding effect and appropriate
choice of surface moieties. The latter were thought to bring about
efficient surface-to-core energy transfer and charge transport.50,51 PPDs were also employed as phosphorescent green and red emitters.49,53 Interestingly, the peak emission of fac-(ppy)3Ir-based PPDs (G1–G4) (Figure 1) in solution was located at 516 nm, i.e.,
very close to that of fac-(ppy)3Ir (λem: ∼508 nm).55 It follows
that the attachment of polyphenylene dendrons on fac-(ppy)3Ir does not change the emission wavelength notably.

iridium complexes.

fac-Tris(2′,6′-difluoro-2,3′-bipyridinato-N,C4′)iridium(III) (fac-(dfpypy)3Ir) (Figure 1) was described as a pure blue PE (λmax: 438 and
463 nm) with high PLQY (∼0.71) and thermal stability (5% loss
at 452 °C from thermogravimetric analysis).56 We thus chose this chromophore as the core of a PPD, en
route to unprecedented blue phosphorescent dendrimer emitters. In
this contribution, as depicted in Figure 1, several (dfpypy)3Ir-based small
molecules and a first-generation PPD with carbazoles in the periphery
(1) are introduced, whereby carbazoles act as charge
transport and energy transfer moieties.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
A trimethylsilyl (TMS)-substituted Ir complex 4 was
considered as the initial candidate because TMS groups
could be transformed into iodo substituents later.57 As depicted in Scheme 1, 2-bromo-5-trimethylsilylpyridine (8)
was synthesized from 2,5-dibromo-pyridine (10) and trimethylsilylchloride
(TMSCl) in high yield (82%). Then, compound 8 was reacted
with 2,6-difluoropyridinyl-3-boronic acid (9) obtained
from commercial 2,6-difluoropyridine (11) to furnish
the functionalized bipyridine ligand (7) by Suzuki coupling
in moderate yield (50%). Subsequently, the one-step reaction between
bipyridine 7 and iridium(III) acetylacetonate (Ir(acac)3) to the iridium complex (4 and 5) failed.56,58−60 A two-step
method was therefore applied by refluxing the bipyridine ligand 7 with IrCl3, providing a dichloro-bridged dimer
(6) as a yellow solid in moderate yield (48%). Then,
the dimer (6) and the ligand (7) were heated
under basic conditions,47 leading to a
yellow solid (5). Attempted substitution of the TMS group
with iodine remained unsuccessful.

Tri-cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes usually
exist in two
configurations, i.e., a facial and meridional, with C3 and C1 symmetry, respectively.60−62 The obtained
TMS-functionalized Ir complex 5 possesses meridional
configuration, as demonstrated by its 1H and 19F NMR spectra (Supporting Information).
The facial isomer 4 was easily obtained by stirring a
THF solution of 5 under UV light for 12 h in high yield
(90%) (Scheme 1e).60−62 For Ir complex 4, only 4 proton signals are present
in the low-field region of its 1H NMR spectra, corresponding
to the 4 protons of the bipyridine ligand; in addition, two peaks
in the 19F NMR spectra represent the two fluorine atoms
in one ligand, thus demonstrating a C3 symmetry of
complex 4. On the other hand, the number of corresponding
NMR signals for molecule 5 was tripled in comparison.

Single crystals of both complexes 4 and 5, suitable for X-ray diffraction, were obtained by slow addition
of methanol to a dichloromethane (DCM) solution. As shown in Table S2 and Figure 2, the facial configuration possesses nearly
identical Ir–N bonds (∼2.12 Å) and Ir–C
bonds (∼2.00Å), similar to those in fac-(dfpypy)3Ir56 and consistent
with its C3 symmetry. For the meridional one, however,
the Ir–N2 bond has a notably longer length (∼0.1 Å)
than that of others. This suggests that these bonds can break and
reorganize to form the facial isomer 4, which is in accord
with the successful meridional-to-facial transformation upon photochemical
treatment.60−62 Moreover, several short intermolecular contacts exist
for both materials (e.g., F···H–C, F···C,
C···C, N···H–C, and face-to-face
π···π interactions) (Supporting Information), similar to those in fac-(dfpypy)3Ir.56

With the successful synthesis
of the TMS-substituted Ir complexes,
the preparation of (dfpypy)3Ir-based PPDs became possible.
In view of the Diels–Alder reaction with carbazole-functionalized
tetraphenylcyclopentadienone (21), ethynyl units had
to be introduced (Scheme 2), yielding TIPSE-functionalized ligands (14 and 15). The first step involved generating the bromo-functionalized
bipyridines (16 and 17) from 2,6-difluoro-pyridine-5-boronic
acid (9) and 2-iodo-4-bromopyridine (19)
or 2-iodo-5-bromopyridine (18) by Suzuki coupling in
which the iodo reacted much faster than the bromo groups. Then, (triisoprypylsilyl)acetylene
was allowed to react with compounds 16 and 17 by Sonogashira coupling to afford the TIPSE-functionalized bipyridine
ligands 14 or 15 in high yields (85 and
96%).

(triisopropylsilyl)acetylene, 80 °C, 24 h, 85% for 14 and 96% for 15; (c) IrCl3·nH2O, 2-ethoxylethanol, 140 °C, 24 h, 57% for 12, 24% for 13; (d) TIPSE-substituted bipyridine 14 or 15, K2CO3, AgSO3CF3, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, 170 °C, 24 h,
25% for 2, 20% for 3.

For iridium complex formation, the functionalized bipyridines 14 or 15 were treated with IrCl3·nH2O to furnish the dichloro-bridged dimers 12 and 13 in moderate yields (57 and 24%) (Scheme 2). Thereafter, TIPSE-functionalized
Ir complexes 2 and 3 were obtained by a
reaction between the dimer and TIPSE-substituted bipyridine 14 or 15 under basic conditions. The low yields
(25 and 20%) are similar to those commonly reported for Ir complexes.47 The collected iridium complexes 2 and 3 were in meridional configurations, as confirmed
by 1H and 19F NMR measurements (Supporting Information).

Compound 2 could not be transformed into its facial
isomer by photochemical treatment, probably due to decomposition upon
prolonged UV light irradiation. Finally, dendrimers 20 and 1 were obtained starting from the TIPSE-substituted
molecule 2. As depicted in Scheme 3, first, the TIPS fragments were removed
by treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF).12 With the ethynyl-substituted Ir complex 22 available, dendrimer 20 was obtained by a Diels–Alder
reaction between 22 and molecule 21 in moderate
yield (55%). The resulting product is meridional, as confirmed by
the 1H NMR and 19F NMR spectra (Supporting Information). As the facial isomer
usually displays a higher PLQY than that of the meridional one,60,63 the former was successfully prepared by photolysis in 83% yield.
The facial dendrimer 1 was comprehensively characterized
by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy, matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass, and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS).

In the 1H NMR spectra
of dendrimer 1 (Figure 3) proton Ha ortho to the fluorine atom appears
as a singlet peak at around 5.90
ppm. Protons Hb and Hc occur at 8.13 and 7.52
ppm, respectively. The carbazole protons at 4,5-positions (Hf) are found at 8.05 ppm, and the tert-butyl group
protons at 1.33 ppm are clearly assigned. Moreover, there are only
two peaks present in the 19F NMR spectra, corresponding
to the two fluorine atoms in one ligand of the molecule.

The MALDI-TOF mass spectra of dendrimer 1 exhibits
a single peak of the molecular ion, in good agreement with the molecular
mass of the dendrimer (Figure S3). The
HRMS spectra show clear isotope patterns of the molecular ion, which
is consistent with the calculated result (Figure S3).

Photophysical Characterization
As
depicted in Figure 4a, both TMS-substituted
Ir complexes 4 and 5 exhibit strong absorptions
between 250 and 300 nm due to the ligand-based π–π*
transitions.56 The relatively weak bands
between 350–400 nm are attributed to the singlet metal-to-ligand
charge transfer (1MLCT).56,60 In addition,
as shown in the inset of Figure 4a, a shoulder between 400 and 450 nm is tentatively
assigned to a mixture of spin–orbital coupling-enhanced ligand
(L)-centered 3π–π* (3LC)
and triplet MLCT (3MLCT) transitions, which is based on
a comparison with fac-(dfpypy)3Ir.56 This is consistent with the two absorption bands
of molecule 4, in which one centered at 412 nm is presumably
ascribed to 3LC and the other (λmax: 438
nm) to 3MLCT according to the proposed orbital diagram
of the Ir complexes (Figure 6, top left). The facial one appears as a stronger and
deeper blue emitter than the meridional one (Figure 4b), which is similar to the situation prevailing
in other reported Ir complexes,60,63 such as fac-(ppy)3Ir and mer-(ppy)3Ir.60 Both emission spectra are structured, resembling fac-(dfpypy)3Ir.56 The small bathochromic shift of the emission of compound 4 against that of fac-(dfpypy)3Ir56 is due to the electron-donating effect of the
TMS groups (Table 1). In line with that, the emission is essentially attributed to ligand-based 3π–π* transitions rather than 3MLCT because electron-donating moieties lead to a blue-shifted emission
for a 3MLCT-type phosphorescence.64 As indicated in Figure 6, TMS-substituted bipyridine (7) has a higher
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) but about the same lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level compared to those of difluoro-substituted
bipyridine 26. With the new orbital formation between
Ir and ligand, it shows that the transition energy of MLCT and LC
of material 4 increases and decreases respectively, compared
with those of fac-(dfpypy)3Ir and consequently
causes blue- and red-shifted emissions individually. This is consistent
with the conclusion from Lee et al., that the emission of fac-(dfpypy)3Ir is mainly attributed to a 3LC nature of the emissive excited states, even though their
calculated results support 3MLCT.56

For the absorption of Ir complexes 2 and 3 (Figure 5), the first
two bands between 270 and 350 nm are due to the π–π*
transitions of the ligands. The weaker one (370–400 nm) is
likely attributed to the 1MLCTs.56,60 The little shoulders above 400 nm are assigned to a mixed state
of spin–orbital coupling-enhanced 3π–π*
and 3MLCT, referring to fac-(dfpypy)3Ir.56 Both are green emitters with
pronounced bathochromic shifts (∼45 nm for compound 3) in contrast to fac-(dfpypy)3Ir (Figure 5b), which should
relate to the extended conjugations. This also suggests that the emissive
excited states exhibit dominant 3π–π*
rather than 3MLCT nature because the former induces bigger
bathochromic shift than the latter when the conjugation is extended.
As shown in Figure 6, for Ir complex 2, due to the
smaller energy gap of ligand 14 than that of difluoro-substituted
bipyridine (26), the reduction of transition energy is
considerable for LL but is much less notable for MLCT, compared to
that for fac-(dfpypy)3Ir. This is consistent
with the 3LC nature of the emissive excited states of materials 4 and 5.

Additionally, both the bathochromically
shifted absorption and
emission of Ir complex 2 compared with molecule 3 is ascribed to the bigger band gap of 4-TIPSE-substituted
bipyridine 15 than that of ligand 14, which
indicates that conjugation at 5 position is more effective (Figure 6). Moreover, Ir complex 3 appears as a stronger emitter than phosphore 2 (Figure 5b), owing
to very high extinction coefficient between 400 and 500 nm (ε
≤ 6000 M/cm) of lumiphore 3, which corresponds
to 3LC and 3MLCT transitions. This is comparable
to that of highly emissive fac-(ppy)3Ir
(ε ≤ 6000 M/cm) in the same region.65 This is also consistent with the higher PLQY of Ir complex 3 than that of 2 (Table 1). The Ir complex 3 is a rare
case of a strongly emitting cyclometalated Ir complex with alkynyl
groups in the ligand.49,53

As to the absorption of
dendrimers, a strong band at around 297
nm is characteristic for carbazole absorptions.66 The band between 320 and 350 nm and the one ranging from
370 to 400 nm are due to electronic transitions of the ligands50 and 1MLCTs, respectively. The less
notable shoulders (400–450 nm) stem from a mixed state of spin–orbit
coupling-enhanced 3π–π* and 3MLCT.56 Both dendrimers are green emitters
(Table 1), similar
to materials 2 and 3. Consequently, dendrimer 1 exhibits a bathochromically shifted emission of 50 nm compared
to that of fac-(dfpypy)3Ir. This strong
shift is correlated to 3π–π* rather
than 3MLCT, similar to complex 2. This feature
is quite different from fac-(ppy)3Ir-based
PPDs bearing very small redshifts (∼8 nm) in emissions as compared
with parent fac-(ppy)3Ir.53 Lo et al. argued that this is due to the lack of conjugation
between dendron and ligand.67 We rather
propose that this is due to the dominant 3MLCT nature of
emissions of fac-(ppy)3Ir-based PPDs (Figure S6).

As shown in Figure 6, for molecule 25, polyphenylene dendrons indeed significantly
decrease the band gap of the ligand compared with bipyridine 26 (4.25 vs 5.05 eV calculated). The close band gaps between
TIPSE-substituted bipyridine 14 and ligand 25 and the similar emission colors of Ir complexes 2 and 1 further manifest that their luminescence has primary 3LC nature. The facial dendrimer displays slightly stronger
emission than that of the meridional one, similar to other Ir complexes,
e.g., materials 5 and 4, but the emission
intensity of both are much lower than that of compound 3. This is consistent with the much weaker absorptions of 3LC and 3MLCT of the dendrimers than those of compound 3. Extending the conjugation of the ligand is an effective
way to tune the color of emission of metal–organic complexes,68 which has been reported for dendrimer-based
blue PEs as well.44

Electrochemistry
The redox properties of some of the
prepared Ir complexes were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Compound 4 and 5 exhibit two oxidation processes, starting
above 1.5 V (Figure S7), which indicates
their relatively low HOMOs (∼−6.00 eV) (Table 1), similar to that in fac-(dfpypy)3Ir.56 Both of them present three reversible reduction couples (LUMO: ∼−2.60
eV). Going to Ir complex 2, due to the extended conjugations,
the HOMO (−5.68 eV) is raised and the LUMO (−2.83 eV)
is decreased compared with molecules 4 and 5. As to dendrimer 1, the HOMO and LUMO were calculated
to be −5.55 and −2.11 eV, respectively. This is consistent
with the FMOs of the peripheral carbazoles,66 probably owing to the big ratio between the number of carbazole
groups and Ir complex segment within one molecule (6:1).

Conclusions
We find that the TMS-functionalized and TIPSE-substituted (dfpypy)3Irs and (dfpypy)3Ir-based polyphenylene dendrimers
exhibit bathochromically shifted emissions, when compared with parent fac-(dfpypy)3Irs due to the dominant 3LC nature of their emissive excited states. This demonstrates that
strong red-shifted emission occurs when both extended conjugations
and significant 3LC character are involved in a phosphore.
It is also found that when both extended conjugations and primary 3MLCT nature are present in an Ir complex, the bathochromic
shift is less notable or much weaker, as seen, for example, in fac-(ppy)3Ir-based polyphenylene dendrimers.
Therefore, this work provides useful insights into the design of new
blue phosphorescent dendrimer emitters besides the most commonly utilized
method of breaking the conjugation between the PE core and the dendron
with alkyl segments.45 Appropriate steps
are: (i) to select the core of a dendrimer with a blue PE with dominant 3MLCT nature of its emissive excited state or (ii) to utilize
a UV PE with major 3LC nature of its emissive excited states
as the core of the dendrimer to push the emission of the dendrimer
into pure blue region by extended conjugations.

and Methods
All chemicals and solvents were
purchased from commercial sources and used as received except where
noted. Reactions were all conducted under argon atmosphere. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AMX
250, AC 300, and AMX 500 NMR spectrometers. The solvents for NMRs
were CD2Cl2 with the reference peak at 5.32
ppm (1H) and 53.84 ppm (13C) and DMSO-d6 with the reference peak at 2.50 ppm (1H). Field desorption mass spectra were recorded on a VG-Instruments
ZAB 2-SE-FDP using 8 kV accelerating voltage. MALDI-TOF mass spectra
were recorded by a Bruker Reflex II spectrometer with fullerene as
the reference and dithranol as the matrix. HR-MALDI-TOF mass spectra
were recorded by a SYNAPT G2-Si time-of-flight instrument equipped
with a MALDI source (Waters Corp. Manchester, U.K.). UV–vis
absorption spectra were measured by a Varian Cary 4000 UV–vis
spectrometer (Varian Inc. Palo Alto) using quartz cells with path
length of 1 cm. Fluorescence spectra were recorded with a SPEX Fluorolog
2 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted
on a computer-controlled GSTAT12 workstation using a three-electrode
system in which a Pt wire, a silver wire (or a saturated calomel electrode),
and a glassy carbon electrode were used as counter, reference, and
working electrode, respectively. The measurements were conducted in
0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) solution
under argon environment with a scan rate of 100 mV/s at room temperature.
The solvents were DCM for the oxidation part and acetonitrile for
the reduction part. Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) worked
as the internal reference throughout the measurements. The calculations
of HOMO and LUMO using CV were based on the following equations, HOMO
(eV) = −Eoxonset + EFconset – 4.80 and LUMO (eV)
= −Eredonset + EFconset – 4.80, where Eoxonset, EFc/Fc+onset, and Eredonset mean the onset oxidation potential of
the targeted molecule, the onset oxidation potential of ferrocene,
and the onset reduction potential of the targeted molecule compared
with the reference electrode. The calculated isotope distributions
of the molecular mass of the dendrimer were conducted with mMass software.

The X-ray intensity data for 4 was measured on a STOE
IPDS-2T X-ray diffractometer system equipped with a Mo-target X-ray
tube. The data frames were collected using the program X-Area and
processed using the program Integrate routine within X-Area. The reflection
intensities were corrected for absorption on the basis of the crystal
faces using XRED-32. The X-ray intensity data for 5 was
measured on a Bruker SMART APEX2 CCD-based X-ray diffractometer system
equipped with a Mo-target X-ray tube. The data frames were collected
using the program APEX2 and processed using the program SAINT routine
within APEX2. The data were corrected for absorption on the basis
of the multiscan technique, as implemented in SADABS. Structure solution
and refinement were performed using SHELT-2014. Crystal of compound 4 contains one molecule of CH2Cl2.

The density functional theory calculations for ground-state geometry
optimizations were performed using PC controlled Gaussian software.
