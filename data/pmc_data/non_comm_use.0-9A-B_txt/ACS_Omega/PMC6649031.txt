In
all the living systems, reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism
provides resistance against internal and external oxidative stresses.
Auranofin (AF), an FDA-approved gold [Au(I)]-conjugated drug, is known
to selectively target thiol-reductases, key enzymes involved in ROS
metabolism. AF has been successfully tested for its inhibitory activity
through biochemical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, against a
diverse range of pathogens including protozoa, nematodes, bacteria,
and so forth. Cocrystal structures of thiol-reductases complexed with
AF revealed that Au(I) was coordinately linked to catalytic cysteines,
but the mechanism of transfer of Au(I) from AF to catalytic cysteines
still remains unknown. In this study, we have employed computational
approaches to understand the interaction of AF with thiol-reductases
of selected human pathogens. A similar network of interactions of
AF was observed in all the studied enzymes. Also, we have shown that
tailor-made analogues of AF can be designed against selective thiol-reductases
for targeted inhibition. Molecular dynamics studies show that the
AF-intermediates, tetraacetylthioglucose (TAG)-gold, and triethylphosphine
(TP)-gold, coordinately linked to one of catalytic cysteines, remain
stable in the binding pocket of thiol-reductases for Leishmania infantum and Plasmodium
falciparum (PfTrxR). This suggests that the TP and
TAG moieties of AF may be sequentially eliminated during the transfer
of Au(I) to catalytic cysteines of the receptor.

==== Body
Introduction
Auranofin (AF), an
organogold drug initially approved by FDA to
treat rheumatoid arthritis, contains an Au(I) atom forming linear
coordinate bonds with triethylphosphine (TP) and tetraacetylthioglucose
(TAG) groups, through phosphorous and sulphur, respectively (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of AF.

Throughout this manuscript, TP-gold
and TAG-gold, together, are
referred to as AF-intermediates. Over the years, antibacterial activity
of AF against several pathogens such as Helicobacter
pylori,1Mycobacterium tuberculosis,2Staphylococcus aureus,3−5Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium,6Treponema denticola,7Clostridium difficile, and
so forth has been reported.1,2,7 Previous studies have shown that AF manifests an antiprotozoal activity
against major protozoal pathogens such as Plasmodium
falciparum,8,9Entamoeba
histolytica, Giardia lamblia,10,11Trypanosoma brucei,12 and Leishmania infantum.13,14 Reported in vitro studies show that AF is
also effective against filarial nematode parasites that cause river
blindness and lymphatic filariasis.15 Thus,
AF can be a highly repurposed drug as it shows lethal/inhibitory activity
against diverse pathogens.

Parasitic organisms are subjected
to an endogenous oxidative stress
and oxidative challenges imposed by the host’s immune system.
The thiol-based redox metabolism involved in scavenging ROS is pivotal
to maintain redox homeostasis in parasites. Thiol-reductases (TRs),
such as thioredoxin reductases (TrxR), glutathione reductase (GR),
thioredoxin-glutathione reductase (TGR), and trypanothione reductases
(TryR), are the key enzymes involved in the thiol-based redox metabolism
in different pathogens. Apart from protecting the cells against oxidative
stress, these enzymes are also essential for proper protein folding
and DNA synthesis.16−18 Previous biochemical and structural studies have
shown that AF and related gold drugs are potential inhibitors of TrxR,
TryR, and TGR.19

TRs are functional
homodimers that exist in two different forms,
high molecular weight TR (HMW-TR) and low molecular weight TR (LMW-TR).
HMW-TRs, predominantly present in eukaryotes, contain a CXYXXC redox
active motif, where X is hydrophobic residue and Y is negatively charged
residue, at the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain,
whereas LMW-TrxR, mainly present in prokaryotes and selective eukaryotes,
contains a CXXC motif at its nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH)-binding domain.20 Two catalytic
cysteine residues, located on Cys-Val-Asp-Val-Gly-Cys motif, are conserved
across the HMW-TRs, TrxR, TryR, and TGR enzymes.

Various inhibitory
concentration and toxicity studies have been
carried out for AF and its analogues, against bacterial2 and protozoal pathogens.21 AF has shown an IC50 of 9.68 μM against LiTryR
and cent percent mortality of the pathogen at 50 μM concentration.14 AF showed Ki of
10 μM concentration against both TrxR and GR activities of TGR
of Schistosoma mansoni (SmTGR) after
1 h incubation but had no effect on mammalian cells in vitro.22 TrxR activities of G. lamblia, E. histolytica, and Toxoplasma gondii were inhibited by AF at an IC50 of 152, 0.4, and 0.28 μM, respectively.11,23,24 AF (150–300 nM) completely
inhibited growth of S. aureus, whereas
1.2 μM of AF achieved the same for H. pylori.1 IC50 and a minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of AF against H. pylori were 88 nM and 2 μM, respectively. A recent study has shown
that N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), AF analogues, exhibit an inhibitory
concentration (MIC) comparable to AF against H. pylori. Interestingly, toxicity of these analogues for human embryonic
kidney cells (HEK-293T cells) is 13–20-fold lower than that
of AF.1 Recently, the AF analogue (referred
as analogue 7) has been shown to inhibit the TrxR from E. histolytica (EhTrxR) at nanomolar concentration
(IC50 = 55 nM) when compared to sub-micromolar concentration
of AF (IC50 = 400 nM).11

Angelucci et al. reported the cocrystal structure of SmTGR with
gold atoms.25 Although the authors used
the SmTGR–AF complex for crystallization, the crystal structure
obtained revealed the presence of only gold [Au(I)] atoms, rather
than AF, forming a linear coordinate bridge between the pair of cysteine
residues (Cys–Au–Cys) at two different sites: (i) the
first redox active di-thiol couple, Cys154 and Cys159, near FAD-binding
site and (ii) the second di-thiol couple, Cys520 and Cys574, at the
C-terminal tail. The cocrystal structure of LiTryR with AF showed
the presence of TAG of the AF and an Au(I) atom linked to the first
di-thiol couple.13 Although LiTryR and
SmTGR have different domain architectures and different substrates
preferences, in both cases, a gold atom forms a coordinated adduct
with the catalytic cysteine residues present near the FAD-binding
site. The formation of an irreversible, stable, linear coordinate
bond between Au(I) and the catalytic cysteines permanently disables
the transfer of the reductive potential from reduced FAD to the cysteines
and thus restricts further redox mechanism of the protein.25 However, no structural information is available
either with the AF or its intermediate adducts with target enzymes.
Despite having several biochemical and structural studies, the mechanism
of binding of AF and transfer of Au(I) from AF to the catalytic cysteines
proved to be surprisingly elusive and remains unknown.

Here,
we used in silico molecular modeling, docking, and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation approaches to (A) analyze the effect of variation
in the binding pocket residues on TRs and AF interactions, (B) understand
the dynamics of the intermediate coordinated adduct in the catalytic
pocket, and (C) perform a comparative analysis of AF and analogues
binding to TrxR, TryR, and TGR from diverse pathogens. This study
would provide important leads to understand the molecular mechanisms
of differing efficacies of AF and its analogues against TRs from different
pathogens and also may shed some light upon the possible mode of transfer
of Au(I) from AF to the target enzymes.

MD Simulation Analysis of AF with HMW-TRs

SiteMap
analysis revealed the dimeric interface
as the most potent binding site in LiTryR. Docking of AF on LiTryR
at the dimeric interface showed that residues from both protomers
contribute for AF binding through a network of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic
interactions, and van der Waals contacts (Figure 2A,B). Glu467, Ser470, and His461 were involved
in hydrogen bond or ionic interactions with the TAG moiety of the
AF. Phe396, Lys61, and Pro462 residues formed hydrophobic contacts
with the TAG moiety. Hydrophobic regions of the TP moiety has established
van der Waals or hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of
Thr335 and His461 residues (Figure 2B).

stick) interacts
with the dimeric interface residues of TryR. The two protomers of
LiTryR are colored in orange (protomer A) and royal blue (protomer
B). AF is present near the catalytic Cys residues and FAD (shown in
green stick) binding site. (B) Interaction of AF (green ball and stick)
with the binding pocket residues of LiTryR is shown. Dashed red lines
and straight blue-red lines represent intermolecular H-bond and ionic
interactions, respectively. Golden dashed lines represent intramolecular
coordinate bonds in AF. Same representation for interaction has been
used in Figures 4, 5, and 8.

The thermodynamic stability of the docked complex was analyzed
by computing ΔGbind. Molecular mechanics/generalized
born surface area (MM/GBSA) calculated ΔGbind of AF–LiTryR complex was found to be −36.72
kcal/mol, indicating a thermodynamically favorable interaction (Table 1). The AF–LiTryR
docked complex was subjected to 50 ns MD simulation (Figure S1). Network of interactions observed in the docked
complex were retained throughout the simulation (Figure S1C), also, low root mean square deviation (RMSD) and
root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the ligand indicate stability
of AF in the binding site (Figure S1A,B).

Comparative sequence analyses
of HMW-TRs reveal that the AF binding
residues are highly conserved in TryR of trypanosomatids, including Trypanosoma cruzi and T. brucei, and TrxR of other protozoal parasites, including P. falciparum and G. lamblia, which indicate that both the trypanosomatids and other protozoal
parasites can be targeted by the AF (Figure 3). Though TryR and TrxR uses different substrates,
cofactors NADPH- and FAD-binding pocket residues are highly conserved,
and two catalytic Cys residues, just before α2 helix, are invariant
(Figure 3). Therefore,
above analyses may explain the susceptibility of these parasites to
AF treatment.

connecting β2−α2, α3−α8 of 1st
protomer and α11 along with loop connecting β19−α10
and α11, α12−η4 of the 2nd protomer. Residues
of these regions interacting with the drug are highlighted in red.
Residues highlighted in blue correspond to various substitutions,
among the residues interacting with AF. The FAD-binding region is
formed by α1, α2, α4, β15, and loops connecting
β2−α2, β6−α6, and η4−α8;
interacting residues are highlighted in yellow. The NADPH-binding
region is formed by α5, β17, and loops connecting β8−α5,
β9−α6, β10−β11, and β14−β15,
and interacting residues are highlighted in green.

PfTrxR
PfTrxR shares a significant
sequence identity
with LiTryR (Figure 3, Table S1). The docking of AF on PfTrxR
and MD simulation analysis showed that residues from both monomers
of the dimeric interface contributed for the AF binding through hydrogen
bond, ionic and hydrophobic interactions (Figure S2), similar to the network of interaction as found in AF docked
on LiTryR. Further, low ΔGbind (−50.05
kcal/mol) of AF to PfTrxR (Table 1) and insignificant change in RMSD and RMSF of complexes,
as function of time with respect to structure of starting complex,
suggested that AF and PfTrxR forms a thermodynamically stable complex
(Figure S3A,B).

SmTGR and BmTrxR
AF docked on SmTGR also showed the
same site of binding and pattern of AF recognition as it binds to
LiTryR and PfTrxR. H-bond interactions through His571, Arg450, and
Glu576 and hydrophobic interactions with Lys124, Pro572, and Leu508
stabilized the AF at the potent binding site (Figure 4A). The protein–ligand RMSD and ligand RMSF of SmTGR–AF
complex analyzed during the 50 ns MD simulation (Figure S4A–C) showed that AF forms a stable complex
with SmTGR. The negative ΔGbind (−51.24
kcal/mol) indicates the thermal stability of AF in the binding pocket
of SmTGR (Table 1).

Figure 4 Interaction

with the dimeric interface residues of SmTGR near the catalytic Cys
residues and FAD-binding site. (B) Modeled structure of BmTrxR with
docked FAD and NADPH indicated in green sticks. (C) Interaction of
AF with BmTrxR. Blue dotted lines represent the predicted nucleophilic
attack on AF.

The BmTrxR structure
was modeled using human TrxR as the template
and validated by the Ramachandran plot analysis (Figure S5A). Also, FAD and NADPH, being readily docked in
the respective binding pockets, support that stereochemistry of the
model was accurate (Figure 4B). Similar to above discussed TRs, in BmTrxR also AF got
docked at the dimeric interface near catalytic cysteine residues with
a similar network of interaction. The major AF interacting residues
like His611, Glu616, Thr613, and other hydrophobic residues are also
present in BmTrxR, which indicates a similar mode of AF binding (Figures 3, 4C). The negative ΔGbind (−35.19
kcal/mol) affirms the thermal stability of AF in the binding pocket
of BmTrxR (Table 1).
The RMSD of the complex and RMSF of AF were found to be within limits
during MD simulation, which indicates high stability of the complex
(Figure S4A,D,E).

Recognition
of AF by LMW-TrxRs of H. pylori, M. tuberculosis, Wolbachia, and E. histolytica
In the
presence of FAD, docking of AF at the dimeric interface
yielded a very low score. Upon removing FAD, the SiteMap analysis
identified FAD-binding site as a potential binding site. Docking studies
of AF were carried out on TrxRs of both H. pylori (HpTrxR) and M. tuberculosis (MtbTrxR)
in the absence of FAD. In both cases, a similar network of hydrogen
bonds and hydrophobic and ionic interactions facilitated the recognition
of AF at the FAD-binding site (Figure 5A,B). The computed ΔGbind supported the thermodynamically favorable binding of AF to HpTrxR
and MtbTrxR at the FAD-binding site (Table 1).

and protozoon. Residual

(C) Modeled structure of WolbTrxR and (D) interaction of AF with WolbTrxR.
(E) Intermolecular contacts of EhTrxR–AF complex.

TrxR of Wolbachia (WolbTrxR), an
endosymbiont bacteria of Brugia malayi, is a LMW-TR and shares significant sequence identity with TrxR
of Francisella tularensis (F. tularensis TrxR) (Table S1). Therefore, we used the F. tularensis TrxR structure as the template to model WolbTrxR (Figure 5C). The modeled structure of
WolbTrxR was validated by Ramachandran plot analysis (Figure S5B). The SiteMap analysis and docking
studies on WolbTrxR showed the FAD-binding site as a preferable binding
site for AF, as found in previously mentioned LMW-TrxRs. The computed
MM/GBSA binding energy of AF to WolbTrxR was comparable to ΔGbind of the HpTrxR–AF complex, which
indicated that AF may form a stable complex with WolbTrxR (Table 1). Intermolecular
interactions between AF and WolbTrxR also support that WolbTrxR–AF
may form a thermodynamically stable complex, and AF may bind at the
FAD-binding site (Figure 5D).

Though EhTrxR is a protozoal TR, it exhibits a higher
sequence
and structural similarity with LMW-TR, compared to HMW-TRs of protozoa
(Figure 6, Table S1). Docking, MD simulation, and computed
ΔGbind studies indicated that AF
binding to EhTrxR is similar to AF binding to MtbTrxR (Figure 5E, Table 1). Comparative sequence analysis of LMW-TRs
revealed that the cofactors binding pockets, catalytic cysteine residues,
and residues interacting with AF are highly conserved, which support
that AF may be recognized similarly by all LMW-TRs (Figure 6).

Figure 6 AF interacting residues

by helices (α1, η1, α4), sheets (β8, β16),
and the loops connecting β7−α3 and β8−α4.
Residues highlighted in red correspond to those interacting with NADPH.
Residues highlighted in yellow correspond to those interacting with
FAD. Residues highlighted in blue correspond to those interacting
with AF (blind docking) and residues highlighted in green correspond
to those interacting with both FAD and AF (dockings in bacterial TrxRs
were carried out in the absence of FAD). PfTrxR is included in the
alignment to reflect upon the difference in AF recognition, between
LMW-TRs and HMW-TRs.

AF Analogues Bind to TRs
Preliminary glide XP-docking
indicated that among virtually screened analogues of AF (Figure 7), analogues belonging
to group “A” was more negative and hence showed better
docking scores than group “B”. Among analogues in group
“A”, A1 exhibited marginally better ΔGbind than LiTryR, PfTrxR, and HpTrxR compared with other
analogues (Table 2).
In contrast, calculated ΔGbind of
A3 to EhTrxR is better than other analogues. It is interesting to
note that though A5 has exhibited better docking score, ΔGbind of this analogue to TRs is weaker than
other analogues (Table 2). Considering docking scores and ΔGbind together, these results indicate that AF analogues, A1, A3, and
A5, may be optimized to develop more potent drug against specific
TRs.1

Docking and Stability Analysis of AF-Intermediates
with LiTryR
and PfTrxR
MD simulations of the generated complexes, in
which the reaction intermediates of AF, that is, TAG-gold or TP-gold,
were coordinately linked to one of the catalytic cysteines, showed
the physical stability of the coordinated complex. The TAG-gold–Cys
adduct was stabilized through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions,
whereas TP-gold–Cys adduct was stabilized mainly by hydrophobic
interactions (Figure 8B,C). Low RMSD and RMSF of ligand in the binding pocket with respect
to the docked structure indicated the stability of the intermediate
complexes (Figure S6). For further investigation
on the stability of the complex, we examined the network of interactions
at the interface between coordinated AF-intermediates and the LiTryR
complex at 10 ns MD trajectory. Most of the interactions were preserved
during MD simulation, suggesting that these might be the intermediate
adducts formed during Cys–Au(I)–Cys linear coordinated
adduct formation (Figure S6). Calculated
ΔGbind of −23.03 and −17.46
kcal/mol for TP-gold and TAG-gold, respectively, also support the
thermodynamic stability in the complex (Table 3). The crystal structure13 and our in silico thermodynamic (ΔGbind) analysis of LiTryR–TAG complex support that
the TAG-gold intermediate adduct may be more stable compared to the
TP-gold intermediate (Table 3).

We carried out a similar study
with TP-gold and TAG-gold on PfTrxR.
Intermolecular interactions between AF-intermediates and PfTrxR and
computed ΔGbind of TP-gold and TAG-gold
moieties with PfTrxR indicated that these intermediates may form a
stable coordinated complex with PfTrxR (Figure 8D,E, Table 3) like LiTryR–AF-intermediate complexes. Less
than 3 Å RMSD and RMSF during the MD simulation of PfTrxR with
AF-intermediates also suggested that, like LiTryR, AF-intermediates
can form stable coordinated complex with PfTrxR (Figure S7).

Discussion
AF, a gold(I)-conjugated
organometallic drug initially identified
against rheumatoid arthritis and later tested to repurpose against
several pathogens, is known to selectively target TRs through a highly
debated but still unknown mechanism. Cocrystal structures of TRs,
SmTGR,25 LiTryR,13 and EhTrxR,31 have shown Au(I) forming
a linear coordinate bound with the catalytic cysteine residues present
near the FAD-binding site. This explains that “somehow”
Au(I) gets transferred from AF to catalytic cysteines. There are many
theories behind the metabolism of AF, but its molecular mechanism
is largely unknown. Tepperman et al. have discussed about the removal
of acetyl groups from AF during its metabolism.35 In this study, we used docking and MD simulation approaches
to explore the possibility of recognition of entire AF by TRs of different
pathogens. Based on the fact that Au(I) from AF gets transferred to
the catalytic cysteine residues, in TryR, TrxRs, and TGR, we hypothesize
that the entire AF should be recognized in the pocket close to the
catalytic cysteines so that they can be selectively targeted and also
the Cys residues of the off-targets can be avoided. Also, the transfer
of Au(I) to the catalytic cysteines should happen in a sequential
elimination mechanism, where either TAG or TP moiety gets eliminated
forming an intermediate coordinated adduct with one of the catalytic
Cys, followed by the elimination of other moiety.

AF Binds to the Dimeric
Interface of HMW TRs
First
of all, we used LiTryR as the target receptor for AF docking. The
binding site mapping analysis showed the dimeric interface as a potential
target site. Docking of AF at this identified site revealed that residues
from both monomers contribute for AF binding in such a way that the
Au(I) gets positioned near the catalytic cysteines (Cys52 and Cys57).
Further, MD simulation and calculated ΔGbind strongly support the stability of the LiTryR–AF
complex.

Comparative sequence analysis shows that the AF-binding
pocket residues are highly conserved across a large group of human
pathogens (Figure 3). Although, TryR and TrxR use different substrates, trypanothione
and thioredoxin, respectively, they have significant sequence and
structural similarity. Thus, we considered PfTrxR, SmTGR, and BmTrxR
for subsequent docking studies. Like LiTryR, in all the three TRs,
interaction profiles, and free energy of the binding support that
AF can also bind to dimeric interfaces of PfTrxR, SmTGR, and BmTrxR
TRs similar to LiTryR (Table 1).

AF Competes with FAD To Bind to LMW-TRs
Previous studies
have shown that AF not only inhibits the TrxRs of H.
pylori,1M. tuberculosis,2 and E. histolytica(11) but also
showed potent growth inhibition against these pathogens. However,
bacterial TrxR exhibits an insignificant sequence identity with HMW-TrxRs
such as PfTrxR (Figure 6, Table S1). The main objective was to
investigate whether entire AF binds to LMW-TrxRs, HpTrxR, MtbTrxR,
WolbTrxR, and EhTrxR. We were also interested to know how differently
AF may be recognized by LMW-TrxRs compared to the HMW-TrxRs. Our docking
studies of AF into the dimeric interface of HpTrxR and MtbTrxR did
not produce a significant docking score. Also, no docking site was
found near the catalytic Cys residues. Apart from the dimeric interface,
the FAD-binding site is also the one which is close to the catalytic
cysteine residues. Therefore, we hypothesized that AF may compete
with FAD to reach the catalytic cysteine residues. Our docking, MD
simulation, and MM/GBSA calculations not only strongly support our
hypothesis but also indicate the stable binding of AF at the FAD-binding
site (Figure 5, Table 1). This shows that
AF is recognized differently by HMW-TRs and LMW-TRs.

AF Analogues
Can Be a Better Alternative To Target Specific
TRs
A recent study has shown that few NHCs, AF analogues,
exhibited inhibitory concentration comparable to AF against H. pylori with less toxicity,1 which indicates that analogues can be better drugs than AF. In addition,
an AF analogue has been shown to inhibit EhTrxR at nanomolar concentration
while the sub-micromolar concentration of AF was known to be inhibitory.11 We carried out in silico binding analysis, using
the analogues outlined in Figure 7, to examine their binding potential to LiTryR, PfTrxR,
HpTrxR, MtbTrxR, and EhTrxR vis-a-vis AF binding to above TRs. We
have identified three leads, A1, A3, and A5, which can be further
optimized for specific TRs. Because all the A-grouped analogues have
TAG moiety, it indicates that TAG may play an important role in drug
recognition. The other NHCs having bulkier aromatic rings, as shown
in Figure 7, may determine
selectivity for different TRs. This analysis also indicates that rather
than “one size fits all”, it is important to design
the tailor-made AF analogues, specific to given TRs.

TR Inhibition
by AF May Be a Three-Step Catalysis Process
The cocrystal
structure of LiTryR with AF has also shown the presence
of the TAG fragment of AF at the dimeric interface region of the protein.13 In this structure, the TAG has been shown as
a separate entity which is not linked to Au(I). The presence of the
TAG fragment and not the TP fragment in the structure explains that
AF gets cleaved into TAG, Au(I), and TP moieties mediated by some
unknown mechanism at the dimeric interface. Our studies also show
that entire AF is recognized at the dimeric interface of HMW-TrxRs.
Based on these facts, we hypothesized that the transfer of Au(I) to
the catalytic cysteines may be catalyzed through a three-step reaction
mechanism: (i) noncoordinative binding of entire X–Au–Y
at binding site; (ii) reaction with one Cys with concomitant elimination
of X/Y and formation of Cys–Au–Y/X coordinative adduct
(Figure 8A); and (iii)
reaction of the second Cys with concomitant elimination of Y/X and
formation of the final Cys–Au–Cys adduct. To investigate
the above mechanism, we created the coordinated adduct of TP-gold
or TAG-gold moieties with one of the catalytic cysteine residues of
LiTryR and PfTrxR. Our MD simulation and MM/GBSA studies showed the
stability of the coordinated adduct in the binding pocket which supports
our hypothesis (Figures 8, S6, and S7, Table 3).

Conclusion
Based on the above analysis, we conclude that AF may bind at the
dimeric interface of HMW-TrxRs, TGR, and TryR TRs. Catalytic cysteines
located near the dimeric interface may form a coordinated adduct with
Au(I) atom. In LMW-TrxRs, AF may compete with FAD to bind to the FAD-binding
site of each monomer. Then, it may form a transient coordinated adduct
with one of the cysteine and then form a stable irreversible coordinated
Cys–Au(I)–Cys complex that permanently inhibits the
catalytic function of the protein. We also suggest that some of the
AF analogues can be optimized as potential drugs against the studied
TR. This study would also help to unravel the mechanistic insights
into metal coordinated adduct formation with target molecules in a
group of compounds where gold- (AF, aurothioglucose, and aurotioprol),
silver- (Ag(sulfadiazene)), arsenic- (As2O3),
ruthenium- (trans-[RuCl4(Me2SO)(Im)]−), or platinum (cis-[Pt(amine)2X2])-based complexes are used as drugs or inhibitors.

Materials
and Methods
Comparative Sequence Analysis of TrxR, TryR, and TGR from Different
Microorganisms
The sequences of TryRs, TGR, and TrxRs of
different pathogens were retrieved from UniProt and NCBI database
(Table S2). ClustalW26 was used for multiple sequence alignment to compare the
motifs/residues involved in interaction with AF, and the cofactors
(FAD and NADPH). Manual editing of aligned sequences was performed
using the BioEdit tool. Multiple sequence alignment was performed
using structurally characterized protein/s as a template.

Homology Modeling
of TrxRs of B. malayi and Wolbachia
Schrodinger
Prime module [Schrödinger release 2017-3: Prime, version 3.8,
Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2014]27 was used for homology modeling of TrxR of B. malayi (BmTrxR) and Wolbachia endosymbiont
of B. malayi (WolbTrxR). The sequences
of the proteins were retrieved from UniProt database (accession ID:
A0A0J9XPT5 for B. malayi and A0A225X7E2
for Wolbachia). Using the module, PSI-BLAST
was performed using the PDB database, and the structure with the highest
score (including percentage homology and query coverage) was selected
as the template. Two chains of the same PDB were aligned against the
query sequence, and a homo-dimeric model with the cofactors (present
in the template structure) was modeled. The structures of human TrxR
(PDB: 2ZZ0)28 and F. tularensis TrxR (PDB: 6BWT) were used to build the structures of BmTrxR and WolbTrxR, respectively.
Human TrxR and BmTrxR share 73% sequence similarity, whereas F. tularensis TrxR and WolbTrxR share 71% sequence
similarity. Structural modeling was followed by loop refinement. The
modeled structures were validated using Ramachandran plot analysis
(Figure S5).

Generation and Quantum
Mechanics Optimization of AF and AF Analogues
The 2D structure
of AF was downloaded in .sdf format from PubChem
(PubChem CID: 70788951) and imported to the Maestro GUI where sulphur
of TAG moiety and phosphorus of TP moiety were allowed to form a linear
zero-order bond (coordinate bond) with the Au(I) metal ion. Similarly,
a set of five NHC were used to generate AF analogues. The AF analogues
were categorized into three groups, where (A) TP group was replaced
with selected NHCs; (B) TAG group was replaced with selected NHCs
and the TP group was replaced with chloride; and (C) TP group was
replaced with chloride. AF analogues were generated by modifying the
TAG and TP moieties of AF with respective NHCs and chloride, using
Maestro 3D builder (Figure 7).

Each compound was, then, subjected to quantum mechanics
(QM) for geometry optimization, using Jaguar (Schrodinger). Density
function theory, MO6-2X hybrid functional, was applied with a LAVCP
basis set, with charge 1 and spin multiplicity 1, in gas phase. The
threshold of maximum convergence criteria, energy change, and root
mean square density matrix change were kept as 100 iterations, 5 ×
10–5 hartree, and 5 × 10–6, respectively. For self-consistent field convergence, ligand field
theory was considered for initial guess. The vibrational frequency
was calculated from this optimization. The optimized geometry was
further refined with single-point energy using Jaguar with LACVP**++
basis set, where ** represents polarization and ++ represents diffusion.

Molecular Docking
In this study, we used LiTryR (PDB: 2YAU),13 SmTGR (PDB: 3H4K),25 PfTrxR (PDB: 4J56)29 and B. malayi (BmTrxR; modeled),
and LMW-TrxRs of H. pylori (HpTrxR;
PDB: 3ISH), M. tuberculosis (MtbTrxR; PDB: 2A87),30E. histolytica (EhTrxR;
PDB: 4CBQ),31 and Wolbachia (WolbTrxR; modeled) structures for docking. SiteMap tool of Schrodinger
software was used to identify the target sites in the protein structures.
The centroid of the identified sites was used for grid generation.
The grid was used for performing rigid docking, where the receptor
was kept rigid, and the ligand was allowed constrained flexibility.
These QM-polarized ligands were docked with the XP precision docking
mode of Glide module of Schrodinger. Negative scores indicate tighter
binding.

Generation of Coordinated Adducts of AF-Intermediate
The AF-intermediates, that is, TP-gold and TAG-gold were generated,
using a 3D builder tool in Maestro Suit, by deleting the TAG and TP,
respectively, from the AF. The ligand structures were further energy
minimized using the OPLS3 force field. The AF-intermediates were then
docked on LiTryR and PfTrxR at the same position where AF was docked.
The ligand was manually positioned near the catalytic Cys residues,
the disulphide bonds present in the crystal structures were broken,
and a formal charge of −1 was assigned to sulphur atoms of
both Cys residues. The complexes were further energy minimized, and
the sulphur atoms of catalytic Cys residues, present in the vicinity
of the Au(I), were allowed to form a zero-order bond (coordinate bond)
with the Au(I) of the AF-intermediate. The stability of the AF-intermediate
in the positioned region was determined by performing a 10 ns MD simulation.

MD Simulation
MD simulation was performed to investigate
the stability of the ligands at the docked site of the proteins. In
the current study, we carried out MD simulations for LiTryR, PfTrxR,
SmTGR, and BmTrxR docked with AF and LiTryR and PfTrxR with AF-intermediate
coordinated adducts using Desmond MD simulations program [Desmond
Molecular Dynamics System, version 2.2, D. E. Shaw Research, New York,
NY, 2009]. All of the complexes were solvated with single-point charge
water model and neutralized with 0.15 M NaCl in an orthorhombic box
(a = b = c = 10
Å and α = β = γ = 90°). The systems were
minimized and equilibrated with default protocols of the Desmond.
The dynamics of the system was calculated with the OPLS3 force field.
The long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using particle-mesh
Ewald method.32 A cutoff radius of 9.0
Å was applied for short-range van der Waals and Coulomb interactions.
The systems were simulated under an isothermal–isobaric (NPT) ensemble at 300 K temperature and 1 atm pressure. The
temperature and pressure of the system were maintained using Nose–Hoover
thermostat33 and Martyna–Tobias–Klein
methods,34 respectively. An integral time-step
of 2 fs was used for the overall simulation. Finally, a 50 ns nonconstrained
MD simulation was performed for systems with AF docked on LiTryR,
PfTrxR, SmTGR, and BmTrxR. A 10 ns MD simulation was performed for
the systems in which coordinated adducts of AF were formed with LiTryR
and PfTrxR.

MM/GBSA Calculations
MM/GBSA is
a method to calculate
free energy of the system. The prime module of Schrodinger calculates
free energy considering energies from different components, such as
electrostatic, covalent, van der waal, and lipophilic interaction
energies.27 Free energy is calculated as
per the following equation  where E represents the minimized
component energies.

ΔGbind of the complexes was determined after docking AF or AF analogues
on the TRs and after 10 ns simulation, by performing MM/GBSA calculation.
The calculation was performed considering the input partial charges
on the ligands. Negative scores indicate tighter binding.
