The
effect of anchoring groups on the optical and electrochemical
properties of triphenylamine-thienothiophenes, and on the photovoltaic
performance of DSSCs photosensitized with the prepared dyes, was studied
using newly synthesized compounds with cyanoacetic acid or rhodanine-3-acetic
acid groups. Precursor aldehydes were synthesized through Suzuki cross-coupling,
whereas Knoevenagel condensation of these with 2-cyanoacetic acid
or rhodanine-3-acetic acid afforded the final
push–pull dyes. A comprehensive photophysical study was performed
in solution and in the solid state. The femtosecond time-resolved
transient absorption spectra for the synthesized dyes were obtained
following photoexcitation in solution and for the dyes adsorbed to
TiO2 mesoporous films. Information on conformation, electronic
structure, and electron distribution was obtained by density functional
theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations. Triphenylamine–thienothiophene
functionalized with a cyanoacetic acid anchoring group displayed the
highest conversion efficiency (3.68%) as the dye sensitizer in nanocrystalline
TiO2 solar cells. Coadsorption studies were performed for
this dye with the ruthenium-based N719 dye, and they
showed dye power conversion efficiencies enhanced by 20–64%.
The best cell performance obtained with the coadsorbed N719 and cyanoacetic dye showed an efficiency of 6.05%.

1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized
solar cells (DSSCs) involving sensitizers adsorbed
onto nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes are of major interest
because of their high incident solar light-to-electricity conversion
efficiency, low cost, low maintenance, and high stability. Extensive
research in this area has resulted in the development of cells with
efficiencies of ca. 13%, achieved by using polypyridylruthenium- or
Zn-porphyrin-based dyes.1−8

Metal-free organic dyes have great advantages over Ru or Zn
complexes
as sensitizers because of their high molar extinction coefficient,
simple and low cost synthesis and purification, and diverse possibilities
for tuning the photophysical and electrochemical properties through
structural modifications.9−22 Although organic DSSCs initially showed low performances compared
with metal complex-based ones, recent works report efficiencies, which
approach or surpass those of Ru complexes (12%);23−36 actually, an efficiency of 14%37 was
reported using cosensitization between two organic dyes bearing different
anchoring groups (alkoxysilyl and carboxy moieties). However, despite
the disadvantages of low abundance in nature and/or latent risk to
the environment of metals such as ruthenium, the high efficiency and
stability of transition metal complexes still make them major players
in DSSC development. In addition, Ru(II) complexes have desirable
spectral and photophysical properties, such as intense metal-to-ligand
charge-transfer transition in the visible region, whereas organic
dyes still show limitations, including narrow absorption bands, aggregation,
poor absorption in the red and infrared regions, and poor stability.6,38,39

A variety of organic dyes
have been studied as sensitizers, the
general structure of which involve a donor−π-spacer–acceptor
push–pull system, which favors electron injection through an
efficient charge transfer and separation on photoexcitation, and allows
possibilities of a wide range of structural modifications to the donor,
π-bridge, acceptor group, and anchoring moiety. The tuning of
the donor moiety can improve interfacial phenomena, spectral properties,
and electronic energy levels, whereas the conjugation between the
donor and the π-bridge can be used to determine the efficiency
of charge separation.9−22,34,40,41

Common electron-donor groups, including
diphenylamine,26,27 carbazole,42 indoline,10,26 and triphenylamine43 in particular, are
extensively used in organic photovoltaics as an excellent electron
source, offering extensive possibilities for modifying the structure,
function, light harvesting, energy levels, charge generation, and
separation. Additionally, they have nonplanar structures that minimize
aggregation and display high conversion efficiencies in DSSCs.25,44−49 The conjugation path usually involves thiophene,9−22,27,50,51 ethene, ethyne,52,53 or benzene units.54,55 Because of their excellent charge-transport
properties, the most efficient systems for DSSCs frequently contain
thiophene units,9−22,31,34,36,50,51 such as oligothiophenes, fused thiophenes, or alkylenedioxythiophenes.
The fused ring thienothiophene moiety offers even better π-conjugation
and smaller geometric relaxation energy losses upon oxidation than
bithiophene.50,51

The acceptor groups strongly
influence the photovoltaic properties
of the DSSC as they are key to electron injection from the dye molecule
to the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor film; they are also
responsible for anchoring the sensitizing dye to the surface of the
semiconductor. The most common anchoring group involves the carboxylic
acid (−COOH) because of its relative stability, ease of synthesis,
strong binding, and good electron communication between the dye and
the surface, forming an ester linkage with TiO2. This group
is normally used in the form of cyanoacetic acid, although derivatives,
such as rhodanine-3-acetic acid, esters, acid chlorides, phosphonic
acids, or acetic anhydride, have also been studied, albeit with lower
efficiencies.9−22,25,56,57

We report the synthesis and evaluation
of the optical and electrochemical
properties of two heterocyclic organic dyes, which contain thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the π-bridge, a triphenylamine moiety
as the electron donor group, and cyanoacetic acid, 3a, or rhodanine-3-acetic acid, 3b, as acceptor/anchoring
moieties. The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs photosensitized with
the prepared dyes 3a−b was also studied. This
comprehensive experimental analysis, combined with theoretical studies
based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, is used to
evaluate the effect of two different anchoring groups on the performance
of the DSSCs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
The
structures of the push–pull dyes 3a–b and
the synthetic protocols followed are depicted schematically in Scheme 1. The dyes are based
on a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-spacer, which
exhibits good charge-transfer properties, excellent π-conjugation,
and low geometric relaxation energy upon oxidation.50,51 Triphenylamine was chosen as the donor group because of its excellent
electron-donating ability, hole-transport properties, and capacity
to suppress the aggregation of the dye through its nonplanar structure.25,31,36,44−49 Combined theoretical and experimental studies (optical, redox, and
photovoltaic) were carried out to determine the most efficient heterocyclic
dye as sensitizer for DSSCs.

Scheme 1 Reagents and Conditions: (a) 1,2-Dimethoxyethane,
Pd(PPh3)4, N2, EtOH, and Na2CO3; (b) 2-Cyanoacetic Acid, Piperidine, and EtOH; (c)
Rhodanine-3-acetic
Acid, Piperidine, and EtOH
Compounds 3a–b were readily obtained
using
the two-step protocol shown in Scheme 1. Aldehyde 2 was synthesized in a 95%
yield through a Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of commercially available
4-(diphenylamino)phenylboronic acid pinacol ester with 5-bromothieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2-carbaldehyde 1. This precursor
was synthesized using the same experimental procedure we reported
recently.58 Knoevenagel condensation of
aldehyde 2 with 2-cyanoacetic acid or rhodanine-3-acetic
acid in refluxing ethanol afforded pure dyes 3a–b in moderate-to-good yields (55–82%) (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The structures of all
synthesized heterocycle π-systems were confirmed by standard
spectroscopic and analytical techniques (see the Experimental Section
in the Supporting Information for more
details).

2.2 Electrochemical Study
The alignment
of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels relative to the inorganic semiconductor
and electrolyte is crucial for the efficient operation of the dye
in DSSCs. To guarantee efficient electron injection into the TiO2 CB, the LUMO level of the dye must be higher in energy than
the TiO2 CB edge, whereas the HOMO level must be lower
in energy than the redox potential of the redox couple (3 I–/I3–) for efficient regeneration of
the oxidized dye.

The oxidation and reduction potentials of
dyes 3a–b were measured by cyclic voltammetry
(CV) to evaluate the redox characteristics of the excited dye molecule
relative to the CB of TiO2 and the possibility of regeneration
of oxidized dyes. CV measurements were performed in degassed dimethylformamide
(DMF) using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate as the supporting
electrolyte, a glassy carbon working electrode (scan rate 0.1 V s–1), a Pt counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference
electrode;59,60 data are summarized in Table 1.

−(4.39 + Eox) (eV) and ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.39) (eV).59,60

c Calculated from the difference between
the onset potentials for oxidation and reduction.

The HOMO levels of dyes 3a and 3b were
calculated from the first oxidation potentials (Eox) (−5.07 and −5.03 eV, respectively).
These are less than the energy of the 3 I–/I3– redox couple (−4.6 eV), indicating
that, thermodynamically, the oxidized dyes formed from electron injection
into the CB of TiO2 will favorably accept electrons from
I– ions, thus providing ample driving force for
effective dye regeneration. The LUMO levels of these dyes are −2.69
and −2.88 eV, which are higher than the CB of TiO2 (−4.0 eV), indicating that electron injection from the excited
molecule to the CB of TiO2 is energetically favorable.61 Electron injection to very high densities of
TiO2 acceptor states can involve a very high interfacial
electronic coupling process, quite insensitive to high values of −ΔG.62 In agreement with this,
injection from the unrelaxed dye excited states has been observed
as one of the main electron injection paths.63 Generally, a minimum driving force of 0.2 V is sufficient to ensure
fast excited-state injection and regeneration of the oxidized dye.64 Therefore, dyes 3a–b have
sufficient driving force for electron transfer from the excited molecules
to the CB of TiO2 and can be used as sensitizers for possible
electron injection in DSSCs.

2.3 Photovoltaic Performance
of the DSSCs
The photovoltaic performance parameters (short-circuit
current density, JSC; open circuit voltage, VOC; fill factor, FF; and efficiency, η)
of DSSCs
sensitized with dyes 3a−b are presented in Table 2 and Figure S1 and compared with those of the standard ruthenium-based
dye N719.

Table 2 Photovoltaic Performance
of DSSCs
Based on Dyes 3a, 3b, and N719
dye	VOC [V]	JSC [mA cm–2]	FF	η [%]	
3a	0.600	9.52	0.632	3.68	
3b	0.517	0.97	0.688	0.35	
N719	0.750	15.58	0.692	8.42	
From Table 2 and Figure S1, it is clear that the photovoltaic
performances of the DSSCs are affected by the nature of the acceptor
groups on the thienothiophene dyes. Comparison of the devices with
dyes 3a and 3b shows that the photovoltaic
performances are significantly improved upon replacing rhodanine-3-acetic
acid with cyanoacetic acid, with the power conversion efficiency of
the solar cell based on cyanoacetic dye 3a being 10 times
higher than that of rhodanine dye 3b. The very low photovoltaic
performance exhibited with dye 3b bearing rhodanine-3-acetic
acid as an acceptor/anchoring group (η = 0.35%) could be due
to the abated short-circuit current density (0.97 mA cm–2). This parameter is related to the interaction between TiO2 and the dye sensitizer, and the lower value observed here can be
attributed to the inefficient electron injection from the photoexcited
dye into the CB of TiO2 caused by the LUMO level being
centered on the carbonyl and thiocarbonyl groups, and therefore isolated
from the −COOH anchoring group by the methylene linker,57,61,64−68 despite its higher energy (relative to dye 3a) and a stronger electron injection driving force. This
behavior for organic dyes with rhodanine-3-acetic acid can be attributed
to the lack of conjugation between the rhodanine ring and the carboxyl
anchoring group.69

By contrast, dye 3a shows an efficiency of 3.68%,
with a JSC of 9.52 mA cm–2 and VOC of 0.600 V. This corresponds
to ca. 44% of the power conversion efficiency generated by the reference
DSSC using the N719 dye. The significant improvement
is due to the replacement of rhodanine-3-acetic acid by cyanoacetic
acid as the acceptor/anchoring group, which leads to more effective
electron injection into TiO2, partly because cyanoacetic
acid presents better coplanarity with the spacer unit and a lower
energy HOMO that facilitates dye regeneration by the electrolyte.

Because of the relatively low molar extinction coefficients of
the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer band of ruthenium-based dyes (<20 000
M–1 cm–1), DSSCs based on them
must use thick TiO2 films to obtain maximum efficiencies.
By contrast, organic dyes commonly have higher molar extinction coefficients,
which allow the use of thinner films and correspondingly reduced charge-transport
losses.9−22,32 Unfortunately, they normally
display narrow absorption bands, which decrease the light-harvesting
ability.11,14,23,39 For a better understanding of the differences in
the performance between DSSC fabricated with dye 3a (which
exhibits the best photovoltaic performance) and the reference DSSC
loaded with the N719 dye and the combination of the advantages
of the two dye families, coadsorption was performed. Coadsorbing different
dyes that cover a different visible spectral region can be an effective
and economic way to increase the efficiency of the solar cells and
in addition, minimize dye aggregate formation frequently observed
on these systems.

The photovoltaic performances of the devices
produced by coadsorption
are presented in Table 3. It is worth noting that the short-circuit current density decreases
as the volume fraction of dye 3a present in the sensitizing mixture
increases (Figure 1a), which can be partially related to the decrease in the absorption
of the N719 band at 530 nm (Figure 1b).

prepared with compound 3a mixed in different volume fractions
with the N719 dye and the respective DSSC devices, together
with (b) the normalized absorption spectra for 3a mixed
with the N719 dye in ethanol solution at 293 K.

a Volume percent mixture ratios.

The same tendency is observed for the open circuit
voltage, meaning
that the presence of dye 3a favors back electron transfer
between TiO2 and the electrolyte. With the coadsorption
of N719, the cell efficiencies were improved by 20–64%.

2.4 Photophysical Studies
The dye is
an essential and unique constituent of DSSCs that works as an antenna
through light harvesting. The overlap of its spectral response with
the solar spectrum will, to a large extent, affect the device photocurrent.
Therefore, the characterization of the electronic spectral and photophysical
properties for the dyes is essential and was performed for 3a–b in solution and in the solid state.

The absorption and fluorescence
emission spectra for push–pull compounds 3 in
ethanol solution at room temperature are presented in Figure S2 in
the Supporting Information. In general,
both absorption and emission spectra are broad and devoid of vibronic
structure. The large Stokes shifts found for them (5718–6305
cm–1, see Table S1) strongly
suggest the involvement of an intramolecular charge-transfer process
between the donor and acceptor groups.

Rhodanine-3-acetic acid
derivative 3b leads, as expected,
to the most pronounced bathochromic shift both in the absorption and
emission spectra (Table S1 and Figure S2) because of the greater conjugation
of the 4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidine ring compared with the cyanoacetic
group;27,66 indeed, 3b displays a 54 nm
(absorption) and 79 nm (emission) red shift when compared to cyanoacetic
acid dye 3a. In addition, a significant decrease in the
fluorescence quantum yield was observed on going from 3a to 3b (ϕF = 0.36 for the cyanoacetic
acid derivative versus 0.02 for the rhodanine-3-acetic acid, Table S1).

Push–pull compound 3a exhibits a higher molar
extinction coefficient (22 079 M–1 cm–1, Table S1) than the standard
ruthenium dyes N3 (13 900 M–1 cm–1)75 and N719 (14 000 M–1 cm–1),70 which is advantageous for the light-harvesting
process. By contrast, rhodanine dye 3b exhibits a somewhat
lower molar extinction coefficient of 12 450 M–1 cm–1; see Table S1.

The fluorescence lifetimes of these compounds in acetonitrile and
ethanol were also obtained by time-correlated single photon counting
(TCSPC, Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). With the exception of 3b in ethanol (where a triple
exponential decay law was necessary), the fluorescence decays were
well-fitted with the sum of two exponentials (see Table 4 and Figure S3 inset with the lifetimes, τi, and amplitude values, ai).

2.5 Ultrafast Dynamics Studies
Although
it is well-established that electron injection from a molecular electron
donor to the CB of TiO2 can be an extremely fast process
(<100 fs), the presence of fast competing processes with electron
injection directly affects the incident photon-to-current efficiency
of photovoltaic cells and concomitantly lowers the conversion efficiencies.71,72 Inherently fast deactivation channels need to be avoided to obtain
highly efficient electron injection in any excited state. These are
competitive processes on timescales ranging from hundreds of femtoseconds
to tens of picoseconds, such that a detailed study of the excited-state
decay channels of dyes, both in solution and adsorbed onto TiO2, can provide valuable information relevant for the rationalization
of DSSC efficiencies.

2.5.1 Femtosecond Transient
Absorption (fs TA)
Study of 3a and 3b in Acetonitrile (CH3CN) and Ethanol (EtOH) Solutions
The time-resolved
transient absorption spectra for the investigated compounds in aerated
acetonitrile and ethanol solutions were measured in the 450–800
nm range and collected within a 7.6 ns time window; see Figure 2. These two solvents were chosen
to (i) help us differentiate between the intrinsic ultrafast decay
components of the investigated compounds and solvation dynamics and
(ii) see how the protic or aprotic character of these solvents will
help us study the occurrence and possibly distinguish between deactivation
processes, such as the excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) and/or
structural relaxation in these derivatives. Previously, for D−π–A
molecules with the acceptor groups, cyanoacetic acid and rhodanine,
these two specific processes were observed and associated with characteristic
lifetimes.72 In addition, it was reported
that in aprotic and nonpolar solvents, ESPT can occur from one dye
molecule’s carboxylic acid to another hydrogen-bonded molecule
(associated by dimerization), whereas in protic solvents, in which
dimerization by hydrogen bonding is inhibited, this process can instead
involve the molecules of the solvent.

Figure 2 Time-resolved transient absorption data
for the investigated samples
collected with λexc = 455 nm in acetonitrile (CH3CN) and ethanol (EtOH) solutions at 293 K. The spikes on the
blue side of the spectra are due to Raman scattering. Also presented
for comparison are the normalized and inverted ground-state absorption
and fluorescence emission spectra.

The fs-TA data show that the spectra are dominated by broad
transient
absorption bands (in the 450–850 nm range, Figure 2). Also present are the negative
ground-state bleach and stimulated emission bands. The latter, due
to the strong overlap with the positive excited-state absorption bands,
only present small contributions at shorter wavelengths (see Figure 2 and the comparison
with the normalized absorption and emission bands).

Global fit analysis (using a sequential
model) was performed with
singular value decomposition (SVD) to better describe the observed
dynamics. In the global analysis, the kinetic traces (at different
wavelengths) are fitted using the same (multi)exponential equation,
with the same lifetimes for all wavelengths, but with their amplitudes
free to vary. Thus, each lifetime has different amplitudes at different
wavelengths represented by the decay-associated spectrum for this
lifetime. The best-fit results, together with the decay-associated
spectra and representative kinetic traces of the characteristic transient
absorption data, are presented in Figures S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information and Table 4. In general, in the acetonitrile solvent,
three lifetime components were needed to properly fit the kinetic
traces, whereas in ethanol, four lifetimes were required to obtain
a good fit (Table 4 and Figures S4 and S5). The fast decay component observed in acetonitrile,
with values of 0.45 ps (3a) and 0.29 ps (3b), can be assigned to the solvent relaxation of the transient species,
whereas the two longer lifetimes correspond to the excited-state decay
of the compounds. These fast components are consistent with the solvent
relaxation times previously reported for coumarin C153 in acetonitrile,
where the characteristic times of 0.12 and 0.26 ps were related to
the inertial and diffusional solvation components, respectively.73 In our case, in acetonitrile, it was not possible
to distinguish between the two solvation components, and only one
lifetime was found in the solvation dynamics. However, in ethanol,
the two shortest lifetimes (0.80 and 9.8 ps for 3a and
0.71 and 7.5 ps for 3b) are in good agreement with the
values found for solvent relaxation in this solvent (0.29 and 16 ps).73 At this point, we would like to emphasize that
the occurrence of fast vibrational relaxation in these decays was
discarded because similar fast transient times were obtained for 3a in acetonitrile, when excitation was performed with different
pump energies (excitation at 455 and 420 nm); see Table 4.

The longest decay components
found in the fs-TA data are, within
experimental error, in good agreement with the long decay time values
obtained by TCSPC and are attributed to the excited singlet-state
decay (Table 4), thus
showing that radiative relaxation is a competitive channel for the
excited-state deactivation of 3a and 3b.

It is worth noting the influence of the solvent properties on the
long-lived components observed in both time-resolved fluorescence
and transient absorption. A significant decrease in the longer decay
components is observed on going from the aprotic solvent acetonitrile
(2032 ps for 3a and 600 ps for 3b) to the
protic ethanol (1056 and 316 ps for 3a and 3b, respectively); see Table 4. A similar decrease was previously reported for a D−π–A
molecule containing a carboxylic-substituted rhodanine acceptor group
and was attributed to the occurrence of ESPT through the interaction
of the compound with protic solvents.74 From the concentration-dependent lifetimes, it was also shown that
ESPT in aprotic and nonpolar solvents can occur through intermolecular
interaction between the molecule’s own carboxylic group and
another molecule, associated by dimerization through hydrogen bonding.74 However, in our case, the latter effect can
be excluded based on the low concentration used in the fluorescence
lifetime measurements. In the case of the fs-TA data, although higher
concentrations were used in these experiments (absorption ≤0.3
in 2 mm optical path cuvettes), the good agreement between the long
decay components in the fluorescence and transient absorption data
(Table 4) leads us
to exclude the occurrence of self-quenching through dimerization in
these samples.

The nature of the transient lifetime with values
in the 40–119
ps range for 3a and 28 ps for 3b (Table 4) is not entirely
clear. Although ESPT and isomerization (e.g., in the cyanoacetic group)
can occur, these processes were previously ascribed to the longest
decay component.72 Corroborating this is
the observed decrease in the long decay component of 3b on going from acetonitrile to ethanol solution, whereas the 28 ps
decay time remains unchanged. Furthermore, for the compounds investigated,
photoisomerization is unlikely because it is expected that for such
large molecules, isomerization should be very slow because the excess
energy is distributed over many vibrational modes, so that it will
take considerable time until enough energy ends up in the “critical
mode,” which drives the isomerization.32 Further support can be found in Figures S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information, where it can be seen
that for 3a and 3b, all kinetic traces completely
decayed within the fs-TA time window (ca. 7.6 ns), thus showing that
the original ground-state population has been recovered.

Therefore,
in agreement with the previous reports for D−π–A
molecules containing cyano-acrylic and rhodanine groups, the transients
with lifetimes in the range of 28–119 ps are attributed to
structural relaxation in the excited state.72,75,76 Thus the excited-state dynamics of the investigated
compounds in acetonitrile and ethanol solution can be described through
a series of sequential relaxation steps: (i) upon photoexcitation,
the molecules in the ground state are vertically excited to a Franck–Condon
state; (ii) this undergoes fast solvent relaxation (solvation dynamics)
to a locally excited state; (iii) subsequent decay of the excited
state through structural relaxation yields the relaxed excited state,
from which the molecules deactivate to the ground state.72,75−78

2.5.2 fs-TA Study for 3a and 3b Adsorbed in TiO2 Films
Figure 3 depicts the time-resolved
transient absorption spectra for the samples adsorbed on TiO2 films. These experiments were carried out with the films immersed
in acetonitrile to replicate the presence of the electrolyte solution,
as in the photovoltaic experiments (see the Experimental
Section). In general, for 3a and 3b, the fs-TA spectra present a positive transient absorption band
in the 520–770 nm range together with a negative signal that
represents the onset of the ground-state bleaching band (see the comparison
with the ground-state absorption spectra in Figure 3). From the global analysis using a parallel
model, three lifetime components were needed to properly fit the kinetic
traces (Figure S6 and Table 4). From Figure 3, it can be seen that for both derivatives,
the whole transient absorption spectrum uniformly decays with the
transient decay lifetimes depicted in Table 4. In the TiO2 films, it is expected
that the electron injection from the dye excited state (initially
formed electron–cation complexes) to the TiO2 CB
occurs within the instrumental response function of our fs-TA system
(<250 fs). This will formally produce the dye radical cation localized
largely on the triphenylamine moiety. The absorption of the triphenylamine
cation radical depends on the substituent and environment, but is
generally in the 630–650 nm region.79,80 However, this is a simplification, and the physical assignment of
the observed transient absorption dynamics on the TiO2 semiconductor
surface is not trivial. Although similar time constants to the two
shortest transient times of 3a (1.8 and 25 ps) and 3b (0.32 and 12 ps) were reported for TiO2 films
of cyano-acrylic acid-substituted triphenylamines (0.8 and 12 ps)
and assigned to changes in a transient Stark field at the dye–TiO2 interface, the occurrence of this effect is not clear in
our fs-TA data.75,76 Indeed, transient Stark effects
(induced by changes in the local electric field of the photoexcited
species, radical cations, and electrons) were observed by ultrafast
pump–probe spectroscopy in a variety of systems including organic
semiconductors, inorganic nanoparticles, and DSSCs.81 However, in our case, we could not identify the spectroscopic
feature that corroborates the occurrence of such a Stark effect, that
is, the characteristic blue shift of the ground-state absorption band
when compared to the ground-state bleaching band obtained from the
fs-TA spectra (see Figure 3). Because there is no clear evidence for any transient Stark
shift, the three time constants necessary to fit the fs-TA decay dynamics
of the investigated dyes are better assigned to recombination between
the cations and trapped electrons. In support of this, the recombination
lifetime strongly depends on the distance of electrons and cations
in the complexes, and thus multiexponential decay kinetics is expected
for this process.75,76

Figure 3 Time-resolved transient absorption data
for the films of 3a and 3b adsorbed in TiO2 (wetted
with acetonitrile) collected with excitation at 440 and 470 nm, respectively.
The normalized and inverted ground-state absorption spectrum for 3a adsorbed in the TiO2 film is also shown for
comparison.

Comparison between the
recombination lifetimes of 3a and 3b shows
that these values are longer for the former
than for 3b (1.8 vs 0.32 ps, 25 vs 12 ps, and 2174 vs
120 ps, respectively). This provides at least a partial explanation
for the 10 times higher photovoltaic efficiency found for 3a compared with 3b (see Table 2). Longer recombination lifetimes should,
in principle, give more time for the electron–cation complex
to dissociate (charge separation) and for electron migration to occur,
thus enhancing the photovoltaic efficiency. In addition, theoretical
work previously reported for rhodanine-3-acetic acid D−π–A
systems showed that the delocalization of the excited state is broken
between the 4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidine ring and the −COOH anchoring
group because of the CH2 group, which affects the electron
injection from molecules with rhodanine-like acceptors to the CB of
TiO2.66 DFT calculations on
dyes 3a and 3b are presented in the next
section. However, the effect on the injection is not totally clear
in our time-resolved data, as adsorption on TiO2 leads
to a decrease of the excited-state associated lifetimes in both molecules,
and from the present fs-TA data, the principal process hampering the
photovoltaic performance of 3b should be the fast recombination
times.

2.6 Theoretical Calculations
To obtain
further insight into the distinct differences in the structures, electronic
properties, and photovoltaic performance of dyes 3a–b, a combined DFT and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) computational study
was performed. Dyes 3a and 3b can have several
different isomers, depending on the relative arrangement of some of
their units. These can have different degrees of conjugation and possibly
very different electronic structures. A total of twelve isomers of
dye 3a and four isomers of dye 3b were studied,
resulting from the consideration of both E and Z configurations and the different conformational arrangements
between the carboxylic acid moiety, the cyano group, and the adjacent
thienothiophene spacer in dye 3a and between the rhodanine
ring and the neighboring thienothiophene moiety in dye 3b. The structures and energies were determined for these isomers at
the DFT/Becke three parameter Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP)
level of theory, taking into account the bulk solvent effects of chloroform;
the optimized geometries of the most stable form of each dye are shown
in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information.

These forms account for approximately 64 and 92% of the population
for dyes 3a and 3b, respectively (the structures
of all isomers studied together with the relative energies and approximate
populations are given in the Supporting Information, see Figures S8 and S9 and Table S2). The DFT calculations indicate
that dye 3b is slightly less planar than 3a in the region between the donor and the π-bridge, with a torsion
angle between the phenyl group of triphenylamine and the thienothiophene
group of 21.3°, compared to 18.8° in dye 3a. Additionally, while the region between the thienothiophene spacer
and the acceptor is essentially planar in 3a, favoring
the efficient electron transfer into TiO2, in 3b, the −COOH acceptor/anchoring group is almost at a 90°
plane relative to the rhodanine ring. This hampers the electron injection
from 3b into the semiconductor.

Table S3 in the Supporting Information shows the calculated relative
free energy, approximate population,
and energies of the frontier molecular orbitals for the three major
isomers of 3a and the two major isomers of 3b. The energies of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals calculated for dyes 3a [isomer (E)-3a-I, −5.05
and −2.64 eV, respectively] and 3b [isomer (Z)-3b-I, −5.00 and −2.71 eV,
respectively] match very well with the experimental CV values (−5.07
and −2.69 eV for 3a and −5.03 and −2.88
eV for 3b, respectively).

The 14 lowest singlet–singlet
vertical electronic transitions
have been calculated by TD-DFT/CAM-B3LYP for the most stable conformers
of 3a, (E)-3a-I, and of 3b, (Z)-3b-I. This long-range
corrected density functional has been found to perform well in the
calculation of excited states with a significant charge-transfer character,
such as the case of the dyes in our study.79,80

Table S3 in the Supporting Information gives the absorption maxima for the three major
isomers of dye 3a and the two major isomers of dye 3b, and Table 5 shows the assignments
of the electronic transitions for the dominant isomers (E)-3a-I and (Z)-3b-I. The TD-DFT results shown in Table 5 indicate that the absorption spectrum of 3a has a strong band at a calculated wavelength of 435 nm (experimental
wavelength at 422 nm), which corresponds essentially to a HOMO →
LUMO transition (71%) with a significant contribution from a HOMO
– 1 → LUMO transition (23%) and a very small (4%) contribution
from a HOMO → LUMO + 1 configuration. The remaining bands in
the region above 300 nm (calculated wavelengths at 325 and 319 nm)
involve transitions between HOMO – 5, HOMO – 2, HOMO
– 1, and HOMO to LUMO and LUMO + 1 and have very low oscillator
strengths. The absorption spectrum of 3b has a strong
band at a calculated wavelength of 451 nm (experimental value at 476
nm), which corresponds to the same electronic transitions as in 3a, however, with slightly different contributions (63% from
HOMO → LUMO, 30% from HOMO – 1 → LUMO, and 4%
from HOMO → LUMO + 1). The remaining bands in the region above
300 nm in the absorption spectrum of 3b (calculated wavelengths
at 345 and 331 nm) also have low oscillator strengths.

are indicated.

Therefore,
the dominant bands in the absorption spectra of 3a and 3b correspond essentially to HOMO →
LUMO transitions. In Figure 4, we analyze the type of orbitals involved in these transitions
and present the energy diagram of the frontier molecular orbitals
of dyes 3a and 3b calculated at the DFT/B3LYP
level. The HOMOs of 3a and 3b are π
orbitals localized essentially on the triphenylamine donor and on
the adjacent thienothiophene spacer. The electron density of the LUMO
of 3a is mainly localized on the thienothiophene bridge
and the anchoring group (−COOH). Therefore, when this dye is
linked to TiO2, the LUMO centered on the anchoring moiety
should enhance the orbital overlap with the titanium 3d orbitals and
subsequently favor the electron injection to the CB of TiO2.

Figure 4 Orbital density distribution and energies (DFT/B3LYP) of the frontier
molecular orbitals of dyes (a) 3a (3a-I)
and (b) 3b (3b-I). The black solid lines
indicate the calculated energies of the orbitals, and the green solid
lines indicate the experimental CV values. The arrows indicate the
TD-DFT/CAM-B3LYP main contributions to the S1 excited states
for each dye. The blue dashed line indicates the level of the CB edge
of the anatase TiO2 surface (−4.0 eV vs vacuum)
and the gray dashed line indicates the I–/I3– redox potential (−4.6 eV vs vacuum).

By contrast, the LUMO of 3b is mainly centered on
the thienothiophene spacer and on the 4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidine ring,
particularly on the carbonyl and thiocarbonyl groups, such that the
maximum electron density of the LUMO is isolated from the −COOH
anchoring group because of the presence of the −CH2– linker group. This, therefore, prevents the 3b electrons from being efficiently injected into the CB of TiO2 via the carboxyl group.57,61,64−68

Thus, the HOMO–LUMO excitation in these dyes has the
nature
of charge transfer from the triphenylamine donor to the anchoring
cyanoacetic group in 3a and rhodanine-3-acetic acid in 3b. This charge separation is convenient for DSSCs because
it facilitates the electron injection from the excited dye into the
TiO2 electrode and also slows down the recombination of
the injected electrons with the oxidized dye molecules. The structure
of the anchoring group in 3b, however, introduces some
loss of efficiency because the LUMO of 3b is not localized
on the anchoring group (−CH2COOH) of the 4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidine
ring because of the methylene group, which reduces (Figure 4b) the probability of injection
of the excited electrons into the TiO2 CB.57,61,64−68

Comparing the energy levels of the HOMO –
1, HOMO, LUMO,
and LUMO + 1 orbitals of the dyes, we can see that the substitution
of the cyanoacetic group by rhodanine-3-acetic acid leads to the stabilization
of the LUMO and LUMO + 1 and a destabilization of the HOMO –
1 and HOMO of 3b, with the consequent narrowing of the
gaps between the orbitals. This explains the red shift in the absorption
maximum in 3b.

The energy diagram in Figure 4 also shows the position of
the HOMO and LUMO energy
levels of the dyes compared with the TiO2 CB edge level
(−4.0 eV vs vacuum)82 and the redox
potential of the redox couple 3 I–/I3– (−4.6 eV vs vacuum).83 For both dyes, the LUMO level is higher than that of the
TiO2 CB edge, providing the thermodynamic driving force
for the efficient electron injection into the CB of the semiconductor.
Further, the HOMO levels in both dyes are lower than the iodide redox
potential, allowing fast dye regeneration. These results are consistent
with the CV measurements.

3 Conclusions
We have studied the effect of the acceptor/anchoring group on two
thieno[3,2-b]thiophene dyes 3a–b as sensitizers in nanocrystalline TiO2 DSSCs. The dyes
were obtained in moderate-to-excellent yields by the Suzuki–Miyaura
coupling reaction, followed by Knoevenagel condensation. Compound 3a, bearing cyanoacetic acid as the acceptor/anchoring group,
exhibits a better conversion efficiency in DSSCs than 3b, which has rhodanine-3-acetic acid as the electron withdrawing and
anchoring unit. This was attributed to the effective and faster electron
injection from the LUMO of 3a dye to the CB of TiO2 and reduction of the dye recombination. Theoretical and experimental
studies suggest that rhodanine-3-acetic acid is not a good anchoring
group because of the broken conjugation between the acceptor and anchor
from the intervening methylene group. This confirms the importance
of a donor, acceptor and anchor in the dye properties.

Enhanced
power conversion efficiencies were observed by coadsorption
of dye 3a with N719. The best photovoltaic
performance obtained for the DSSC prepared with the 25/75 volume percent
ratio of 3a/N719 displayed 6.05% energy
conversion efficiency.

4 Experimental Section
4-(Diphenylamino)phenylboronic acid pinacol ester and cyanoacetic
acid were purchased from Aldrich. Rhodanine-3-acetic acid was purchased
from Alfa Aesar. All commercially available reagents and solvents
were used as received. The 5-bromothieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2-carbaldehyde
precursor was prepared using the same synthetic methodology previously
reported by us.58 The reaction progress
was monitored by thin-layer chromatography, using 0.25 mm thick precoated
silica plates (Merck Fertigplatten Kieselgel 60 F254), and the spots
were visualized under ultraviolet light. Purification was achieved
by silica gel column chromatography (Merck Kieselgel, 230–400
mesh).

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained
on a Bruker
AVANCE II 400 spectrometer at an operating frequency of 400 MHz for 1H (see Figures S10–S12 in the Supporting Information) and 100.6 MHz for 13C, using the solvent
peak as the internal reference (see the Supporting Information for further details).

Melting points were
determined on a Gallenkamp apparatus and are
uncorrected. Infrared spectra were recorded on a BOMEM MB 104 spectrophotometer.
Absorption and fluorescence emission spectra were collected with a
Shimadzu UV/2501PC and a Horiba-Jobin-Yvon FluoroMax-4 spectrophotometer,
respectively. Fluorescence quantum yields were determined using rhodamine
6G (ϕF = 0.95) in ethanol solution.84 Mass spectrometry analysis was performed at the C.A.C.T.I.–Unidad
de Espectrometria de Masas of the University of Vigo, Spain.

The synthetic procedures for precursor aldehyde 2 and
the investigated triphenylamine–thienothiophenes 3a–b are described in the Supporting Information.

CV was performed using an AUTOLAB electrochemical station
in a
three-electrode cell configuration, as elsewhere reported,59 and measured at a scan rate of 0.1 V s–1 (see Figure S13). The solutions were
deoxygenated by bubbling nitrogen before each measurement. The concentration
of dyes was 1 mM with 0.1 M [NBu4][BF4] as the
supporting electrolyte in the dry DMF solvent. The electrode potentials
were reported in relation to that of the Fc+/Fc redox couple.59,60

Molecular structure calculations for compounds 3a–b were performed on the DFT level with the B3LYP exchange correlation
functional, which combines the hybrid exchange functional of Becke85 with the correlation functional of Lee, Yang,
and Parr.86 No symmetry constraints were
imposed, and the all-electron 6-31G(d,p) double-ζ plus polarization
basis sets were used for all atoms. The effects of the bulk solvent
(chloroform) were considered using the polarizable continuum model
(PCM).87 In this model, the solute molecules
are placed into a spherical cavity surrounded by a dielectric continuum.
Default van der Waals radii were used in PCM for all atoms. Additionally,
the molecular structures of the most stable isomers of compounds 3a–b were optimized with the CAM-B3LYP88 functional. At the final equilibrium geometries with minimum
energy, the maximum gradient was 1 × 10–6 or
1 × 10–5 hartree bohr–1.
The vibrational frequencies were calculated for all equilibrium structures
to confirm that they are true minima (i.e., no imaginary frequencies).
The vertical excitation energies were calculated by TD-DFT for the
14 lowest singlet-excited states, using the CAM-B3LYP88 functional with the 6-311G(d,p) triple-ζ plus polarization
basis sets to analyze the absorption properties of the dyes. The bulk
solvent effects of chloroform were also taken into account in the
TD-DFT calculations. All calculations were carried out using the GAMESS-US
code.89

The ultrafast transient spectroscopic
and kinetic measurements
were performed in a Helios spectrometer (Ultrafast Systems) with an
instrumental response function of around 250 fs (apparatus described
elsewhere);90 see the Supporting Information for further details. The spectral chirp
of the data was corrected using Surface Xplorer PRO program from Ultrafast
Systems. Global analysis of the data (using a sequential model) was
performed using Glotaran software.91

Porous TiO2 films (about 1 μm thick) for the fast
dynamics studies were made by spreading TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide
T/SP, from Solaronix SA) onto a glass microscope slide, using Scotch
Magic tape as a spacer. The film paste was then sintered up to 500
°C. When the films had cooled to about 80 °C, they were
placed in a dye solution (0.2 mM, ethanol) for adsorption of the sensitizer
for 1 min. For kinetic experiments, a drop of acetonitrile was poured
into the sensitized films, which were then covered with a second microscope
slide.

Fluorescence decays were measured using a home-built
TCSPC apparatus,
as elsewhere described.92 The fluorescence
decays were analyzed using the method of modulating functions implemented
by Striker.93

DSSCs were prepared,
as described in the Supporting Information. The photovoltaic performance was obtained with
an Oriel Class solar simulator and a ZENNIUM workstation, using a
metal mask with an aperture area of 0.2 cm2, as previously
reported.59
