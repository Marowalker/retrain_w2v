A gold nanoparticle (AuNP) has a
localized surface plasmon resonance peak depending on its size, which
is often utilized for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). To
obtain information on the cholesterol (Chol)-incorporated lipid membranes
by SERS, AuNPs (5, 100 nm) were first functionalized by 1-octanethiol
and then modified by lipids (AuNP@lipid). In membrane surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (MSERS), both signals from 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and Chol molecules were
enhanced, depending on preparation conditions (size of AuNPs and lipid/AuNP
ratio). The enhancement factors (EFs) were calculated to estimate
the efficiency of AuNPs on Raman enhancement. The size of AuNP100nm@lipid was 152.0 ± 12.8 nm, which showed an surface
enhancement Raman spectrum with an EF2850 value of 111
± 9. The size of AuNP5nm@lipid prepared with a lipid/AuNP
ratio of 1.38 × 104 (lipid molecule/particle) was
275.3 ± 20.2 nm, which showed the highest enhancement with an
EF2850 value of 131 ± 21. On the basis of fluorescent
probe analyses, the membrane fluidity and polarity of AuNP@lipid were
almost similar to DOPC/Chol liposome, indicating an intact membrane
of DOPC/Chol after modification with AuNPs. Finally, the membrane
properties of AuNP@lipid systems were also discussed on the basis
of the obtained MSERS signals.

Introduction
Metal nanomaterials,
such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), have attracted attention in the
analysis of biological molecules. Depending on the sizes, the AuNPs
show a localized surface plasmon resonance peak,1 which can be applied in sensor development and surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS).2−4 In addition, because the surface
of AuNPs can be modified by various types of molecules, AuNPs are
widely utilized in drug delivery systems, imaging, sensors, and medical
engineering.5−8 In biological systems, a self-organized lipid membrane has several
important roles such as controlling the structure of membrane protein,
transporting molecules across the membrane, and signal transduction
using mediators. To better understand such emergent functions that
have arisen at the membrane interface,9,10 localized
molecular behavior and lipid membrane property studies are necessary.
However, the investigation of the fundamental properties of lipid
membranes based on lipid information is challenging. Thus, methods
based on SERS are applied for membrane studies, wherein a Raman probe,
which is localized in the membrane and emits strong signals when excited
by a laser, is usually employed to ensure lipid membranes. Carbonate-capped
AuNPs were utilized as artificial ion transporters across biological
membranes.11 Owing to the surface properties,
the synthetic nanoparticles (NPs) can interact with lipid membranes.12,13 The AuNPs were utilized to determine the surface charge of lipid
membranes.14 SERS techniques are also applied
to living cell membrane systems.15 Raman
signals enable the identification of the structural information of
lipid molecules in the membrane.16,17 In addition,
metal nanostructures have discovered the hot spot which produced strong
Raman signals.18 Thus, the location of
NPs must be controlled to gain in situ information from the enhanced
Raman spectrum.

There has been significant interest in molecular
behaviors of membrane components such as cholesterol (Chol) and sphingomyelin.
Direct spectroscopy measurements, such as Raman, infrared, nuclear
magnetic resonance, calorimetry, and so forth, have been employed
to understand self-assembly behaviors of membrane lipids. However,
signal intensities are sometimes problematic for quantitative analysis.
The use of fluorescence probe is also a reliable method to study membrane
properties, such as 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) for membrane
fluidity (1/P) and 6-lauroyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene
(Laurdan) for membrane polarity (GP340). These methods
are powerful to wheel the lipid membrane studies until now; however,
a concern is that the probe signal is indirect. Although an SERS method
requires membrane labeling with a plasmonic material (e.g., AuNP),
it can directly reflect the molecular information of the target. Thus,
the SERS signals obtained from a lipid membrane could provide spontaneous
information about lipids (molecular conformation and localization). Table 1 describes some previous
studies on inner membrane analysis. Zhang and Granick analyzed the
lateral lipid diffusion in the inner and outer leaflets in planar-supported
lipid bilayers and suggested that the component in the inner leaflet
typically diffused slowly.19 Murzyn et
al. analyzed an inner bacterial membrane composed of phosphatidylethanolamine
(PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and built a computer model showing
the interactions of the bilayer interfacial regions via intermolecular
hydrogen bond and water bridges, revealing that PE and PG strongly
interacted in the bilayer.20 In addition,
an intensive inner lipid study on Chol was performed through various
methods.21−23 However, nanodomains could be visualized with the
advanced microscopy equipment.24

Typically,
the thickness of a lipid bilayer vesicle is approximately 4–6
nm. The hydrophilic NPs are located on the outer leaflet of liposomes,25 whereas the hydrophobic NPs are internalized
in the lipid membranes depending on the particle size.26 In multilayer membranes, synthesized NPs (diameter:
ca. 5 nm) can be embedded into bilayers.27,28 Hydrophobic AuNPs can also be embedded into a lipid bilayer,29 suggesting that the SERS technique can be applied
to detect hydrophobic materials existing in the lipid membranes. Because
a membrane of Chol-enriched domains (liquid-ordered phase, composed with saturated lipids and sphingolipids)
tends to be thicker than a fluid membrane (without Chol), there might
be disadvantages in utilizing large-sized AuNPs.

In our previous
study, AuNP100nm was utilized to study self-assembled phospholipid
membranes (AuNP100nm@lipid), and a method to obtain highly
sensitive lipid membrane information using AuNP100nm@lipid
was developed, known as membrane surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(MSERS).30 Using the enhancement factor
(EF) as the indicator to determine the efficiency of Raman enhancement
for a target molecule,31 the membrane thickness
was found to be possibly relevant to Raman enhancement because a hot
spot can occur at the contact surface between the AuNPs. The enhancement
mechanism for AuNP100nm systems is as follows: the 100
nm AuNPs served as a core around which lipids were coated. The sonication
treatment (60 min in a sonication bath) decreased the aggregation
of AuNP100nm@lipid particles. For long periods of incubation,
some AuNP100nm@lipid particles were aggregated with each
other. Simultaneously, the lipid membranes were sandwiched between
the AuNPs (hot spot). However, the AuNP100nm@lipid system
has the following disadvantages: (1) thicker membrane (C–H
chains longer than C18) shows smaller enhancement because enhancement
depends on the distance between the lipid-coated AuNPs, and (2) the
charged membrane did not cause SERS because the electrostatic repulsion
between the lipid-coated AuNPs increases the distance between them.
The distance between the two AuNPs is critical for the SERS intensity.32,33

In this work, we aim to develop a SERS-based characterization
for the lipid membrane systems, particularly to compare the effect
on AuNP size on SERS performances. Herein, two types of AuNPs were
employed: the systems utilizing AuNP100nm30 and AuNP5nm. The prepared AuNP5nm@lipid and AuNP100nm@lipid were characterized on the basis
of conventional fluorescent probe methods and of SERS analysis. Lipid
membranes were composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DOPC)/Chol = (60/40). A side-by-side comparison of membrane properties
was performed to ensure influences of AuNPs on lipid membranes. In
addition, the phase state and membrane properties can be changed from
liquid-disordered phase (DOPC-enrich) to liquid-ordered phase (Chol-enrich)
depending on the Chol amount.34,35 Then, the obtained
results were discussed focusing on the influence of AuNPs, which could
directly alter the membrane properties via AuNP–lipid interaction,
and also an indirect influence, for example, the altered distribution
(local concentration) of Chol because of the presence of AuNPs.

Experimental
Section
Materials
DOPC was purchased from NOF Corporation (Tokyo,
Japan). Chol and citrate-stabilized AuNP100nm (3.8 ×
109 particles per mL) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). 1-Octanethiol and other chemicals used in this study
were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan) and used without
further purification. Citrate-capped AuNP5nm was synthesized
according to a previous report.36 Briefly,
a HAuCl4 solution was mixed with an ice-cold NaBH4 solution at 25 °C. The final concentrations of HAuCl4, trisodium citrate, and NaBH4 were 0.25, 1.25, and 1.25
mM, respectively. Cross-flow filtration was performed using a hollow
tube (MicroKros Module, Spectrum Laboratories, Inc.) to concentrate
AuNPs.

Preparation of AuNP@Lipid
The lipid composition used
in this study was the mixture of DOPC/Chol (60/40). The AuNP5nm@lipid samples were prepared by mixing 2 mL of 5 nm AuNP solution
(total [Au] concentration of 0.14 mM), 3 mL of ethanol, and 10 μL
of 1-octanethiol dissolved in chloroform (volume ratio: chloroform/1-octanethiol
= 300/1). The mixture was stirred for 3 h at room temperature and
then the solution was separated into two phases by incubating for
30 min. The bottom phase was transferred carefully to a round-bottomed
flask. The solvent was removed by evaporation under vacuum condition.
Afterward, the obtained 1-octanethiol-functionalized AuNPs were kept
under high vacuum overnight, thus completely removing the solvent.
The CHCl3 solution of lipids was applied to 1-octanethiol-functionalized
AuNPs, and the solvents were removed by evaporation. The dried samples
were hydrated with pure water. The lipid/AuNP5nm ratios
used in this study were 1.38 × 104, 2.76 × 104, and 1.38 × 105 [lipid molecules/particle]
(for details, see the Supporting Information). The AuNP100nm@lipid samples were prepared according
to the reported method.30 These data were
compared to discuss the difference of inner and outer membrane properties.
Because the prepared AuNP@lipid samples included no precipitates of
lipid, it is assumed that Chol was successfully incorporated into
the lipid membrane. The concentration of DOPC was measured with an
assay kit (Phospholipid C-Test; Wako Pure Chemical).37

Size Distributions of AuNP@Lipid
The hydrodynamic diameters and size distributions of the AuNP@lipid
suspensions were determined at 25 °C using dynamic light scattering
(DLS) [Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)]. The
samples were measured as prepared (no pretreatment by filter), and
no larger aggregates (size > 1 μm) were detected. The size
distribution of AuNP5nm was determined by a scanning transmittance
electron microscope (HD-2700B, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV (Figure S1).

Raman Measurements of AuNP@Lipid
The Raman spectra of liposomes, AuNP5nm@lipid, and AuNP100nm@lipid were measured using a confocal Raman microscope
(LabRAM HR-800, Horiba Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). A 532 nm YAG laser of
100 mW was used for excitation, and a 20× objective lens was
used to focus the laser beam. The spatial resolution in the measurement
was ca. 50 μm × 50 μm (x–y) and ca. 5 μm (z). The prepared
AuNP@lipid particles were small (diameter less than 1 μm). All
the spectra reported here were measured with an accumulation time
of 20 s, and each spectral data were accumulated five times. The measurements
were carried out on a temperature-controlled Peltier plate, which
kept the sample temperature at 25 °C. The background signal (water)
was removed to obtain the actual Raman intensity of lipids (for details,
see the Supporting Information).

Calculation
of EF
To investigate the Raman signal, the EF value was calculated
using the following equation 1  where IMSERS represents the Raman intensity obtained in AuNP@lipid, and CMSERS represents the total concentration of
lipid in AuNP@lipid. The Iliposome represents
the Raman intensity obtained in DOPC/Chol (60/40) liposomes (no modification
with AuNPs), wherein the total lipid concentration (=Cliposome) was 100 mM. The value of I/C indicates a normalized Raman intensity by applied lipid
concentration. Raman spectrum measurements were conducted at least
three times, and the average value of each peak intensity was employed
to calculate EF.

Fluorescence Emission Spectra of Laurdan
Ten microliter of 100 μM Laurdan in ethanol was mixed with
12.5 μL of vesicle suspension, and the sample solution was diluted
with water to a total volume of 1 mL. The molar ratio of total lipid/probe
was 100/1. The sample solutions were incubated for 30 min at room
temperature. Then, the fluorescence spectrum of Laurdan was recorded
with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm, at emission wavelengths from
400 to 600 nm. The membrane polarity (GP340) at different
temperatures was determined from35,38,39 2  where I440 and I490 are the emission intensities of Laurdan
at 440 and 490 nm wavelengths, respectively.

Fluorescence Polarization
Measurements
To measure membrane fluidity, 0.4 μL of
100 μM DPH ethanol solution was mixed with 12.5 μL of
vesicle suspension. The sample solution was diluted with water to
a total volume of 1 mL. The molar ratio of total lipid/probe was 250/1.
Before fluorescence polarization measurements, the samples were incubated
for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, the
fluorescence polarization of DPH was measured using a fluorescence
spectrophotometer (FP-8500, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) (Ex. = 360 nm, Em.
= 430 nm). Fluorescence polarizers were set on the excitation and
emission light pathways. With the emission polarizer angle of 0°,
the fluorescence intensities obtained with the emission polarizer
angle 0° and 90° were defined as I⊥ and I∥, respectively.
With the emission polarizer angle of 90°, the fluorescence intensities
obtained with the emission polarizer angle 0° and 90° were
defined as i⊥ and i∥, respectively. The polarization (P) was then calculated using 3  where G (=i⊥/i∥) is the
correction factor. Because polarization is inversely proportional
to fluidity,35,38 the membrane fluidity was evaluated
by the reciprocal of polarization (1/P).

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of AuNP@Lipid Self-Assembly
AuNP100nm@lipid and AuNP5nm@lipid were prepared
based on the same protocol. The hydrodynamic diameters of the self-assemblies
were determined by DLS (Figure 1, Table 2).
The average sizes of AuNP100nm@lipid and AuNP5nm@lipid were 209.4 ± 26.5 and 352.5 ± 37.4 nm, respectively.
Ultrasound sonication (60 min) reduces the interparticle aggregates.30 Consequently, the average sizes of AuNP100nm@lipid and AuNP5nm@lipid were decreased to
152.0 ± 12.8 and 275.3 ± 20.2 nm, respectively. In the following
experiments, the ultrasound-treated AuNP@lipid samples were used.

MSERS Signals Obtained by AuNP100nm@Lipid Systems
To clarify the modification model of the
lipid membrane, the role of AuNPs in SERS from the lipid membrane
was studied by selecting two AuNPs with different sizes [5 nm (small)
and 100 nm (large)]. In a previous study, AuNP100nm@lipid
samples were prepared to analyze the surface region of the membrane
leaflet.30Figure 2 shows MSERS of AuNP100nm@lipid
[total lipid: 1 mM (blue line)], compared to conventional liposome
(100 mM, orange line). AuNP100nm@lipid shows high Raman
signals even in low lipid concentration (1 mM). The insertion of AuNP100nm successfully enhanced the Raman intensities both in the
fingerprint (500–2000 cm–1) and in the C–H
stretching regions (2700–3100 cm–1): peaks
were clearly observed at 714 cm–1 [choline head
group (DOPC)], 2852 cm–1 [symmetric stretching −CH2– (DOPC)], and 2872 cm–1 [asymmetric
−CH2– (Chol)]. The enhancement in the fingerprint
region was relatively weaker than that in the C–H stretching
region. The enhancement of AuNP100nm@lipid was further
found to be sensitive to the membrane thickness,30 suggesting that a hot spot can be formed in the thicker
membrane region, that is, Chol-enriched domains. In the C–H
stretching region (2700–3100 cm–1), the peak
at 2872 cm–1 was derived from Chol, while the peak
at 2852 cm–1 originated from the hydrocarbon chain
of the phospholipid (herein DOPC). The mechanism for the 100 nm AuNP
systems was as follows (also see Suga et al.30): the 100 nm AuNP acts as a core, and the lipids were coated around
the AuNPs. In our previous works, the sonication treatment (60 min
in sonication bath) decreased the aggregation of AuNP100nm@lipid particles. For longtime incubation, some AuNP100nm@lipid particles were aggregated with each other. Simultaneously,
the lipid membranes were sandwiched between the AuNPs (hot spot).
Although the lipid membrane of AuNP100nm@lipid system does
“not” show a bilayer structure, the membrane properties
are quite similar to the liposome systems.

Figure 2 Raman spectra of AuNP100nm@lipid (blue) and liposome (orange), obtained with total
lipid concentrations of 1 and 100 mM, respectively. Lipid compositions
were DOPC/Chol (60/40). All samples were measured at 25 °C. At
least three reproducible spectra were obtained for each system. Raw
spectral data are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

MSERS Signals Obtained
from AuNP5nm@Lipid Systems
AuNP5nm@lipid
systems are expected to enhance the inner membrane region because
of the embedding small AuNPs. In a similar way, to prepare AuNP100nm@lipid systems, the AuNP(5nm) was first modified
with 1-octanethiol as the hydrophobic dispersing agent, which could
then be embedded into the lipid bilayers. Small AuNPs could be located
between the bilayer membrane, owing to their small size (approximately
5 nm), and the small space between the bilayer leaflet. In theory,
NPs (diameter, ca. 5 nm) can be inserted into lipid bilayers.26 The synthesized small AuNP5nm was
implemented in DOPC/Chol (60/40) membranes. Figure 3 shows that several lipid/AuNP ratios were
tested for MSERS: lipid/AuNP ratios such as 1.38 × 104 [total lipid: 0.5 mM (red line)], 2.76 × 104 [total
lipid: 1.0 mM (green line)], and 1.38 × 105 [total
lipid: 5.0 mM (purple line)]. The embedding of AuNP5nm was
entrapped in the hydrophobic area of the bilayer, thereby enabling
the enhancement of Raman signals at the inner membrane region. This
indicates that the MSERS signals obtained from AuNP5nm@lipid
systems are sensitive to the lipid/AuNP ratio.

Figure 3 Raman spectra of AuNP5nm@lipid, with different lipid/AuNP ratios: red, lipid/AuNP
= 1.38 × 104; green, lipid/AuNP = 2.76 × 104; and purple, lipid/AuNP = 1.38 × 105. Lipid
compositions were DOPC/Chol (60/40). All samples were measured at
25 °C. At least three reproducible spectra were obtained for
each system. Raw spectral data are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

Herein, it is assumed that a liposome (unilamellar vesicle) with
a diameter of 300 nm is composed of ∼100 000 units of
lipid. When the prepared AuNP@lipid is composed of unilamellar vesicle
with a diameter of ∼280 nm (estimated by DLS), with lipid/AuNP
ratio = 1.38 × 104, hopefully several NPs exist in
assembly. When the lipid/AuNP ratio = 1.38 × 105,
only one (or less than 1) AuNP exists in assembly, and the gap formation
within the assembly could be difficult. Thus, a larger lipid/AuNP
ratio would increase the possibility of the gap between AuNPs in a
vesicular envelope. The occurrences of hot spots increase as more
AuNPs occur in the membrane and the lipid/AuNP ratio is reduced. Focusing
on AuNP5nm@lipid with a lipid/AuNP ratio of 1.38 ×
104, AuNP5nm@lipid showed several peaks both
in the fingerprint and the C–H stretching regions compared
to that of AuNP100nm@lipid. These enhanced signals were
due to the hot spot from the AuNP.40 However,
a low ratio of lipid/AuNP was observed at the highest Raman signal,
likely because of the closer distances between embedded AuNPs to produce
the hot spot. In addition, it was concluded that AuNP5nm was inserted into the vesicle owing to the hydrophobic interaction
between the AuNP and the lipid bilayers. Therefore, MSERS signals
showed clearer peaks, notably at the fingerprint area, which has several
hydrophobic parts of lipid.

Comparison of EF for AuNP@Lipid Systems
The analysis of Raman spectra is required after embedding small
AuNPs into the lipid bilayer. The EF is necessary in SERS study to
determine and understand the efficiency of Raman enhancement by using
small AuNPs. The SERS intensity is relevant to the distance between
the target molecule and NP and the number of target molecules associated
with NPs.41 To simplify, eq 1 can be employed to estimate the
efficiency of Raman enhancement by modifying with alkanethiol-functionalized
AuNPs.30 Here, Raman spectroscopy measurements
were conducted for the samples. Total lipid concentrations for AuNP100nm@lipid and AuNP100nm@lipid systems were 0.5
and 1 mM. Thus, the EF values can be indicators to optimize the preparation
of AuNP@lipid systems. AuNP5nm@lipid has greatly contributed
to the membrane interior analysis, which enables AuNPs to locate into
the nanodomain lipid bilayer.42 The DOPC
and Chol peaks packed in the interior membrane have been assigned
to 2852 and 2872 cm–1 for CH2 symmetric
and CH2 asymmetric stretching, respectively.17 The ratio of these peaks indicates the packing
density (R) of the lipid membrane.43 Because there is limited information about the inner membrane
(Table 1), MSERS can
be used as a method to understand the inner membrane leaflet. In this
case, the inner membrane leaflet was induced with small AuNP5nm and confirmed to be located vertically on the membrane by Raman
spectroscopy that produced high Raman signals in the fingerprint area
than in the hydrocarbon area.

The EF values of AuNP@lipid obtained
in this study are listed in Table 3. The EF values at several points (714, 1668, 2852,
2872, and 2930 cm–1), corresponding to ν(N–CH3) symmetric, ν(ROH) (from Chol), ν(CH2) symmetric, ν(CH2) asymmetric (from Chol), and
ν(CH3) symmetric, respectively,44,45 are compared. The average EF values of AuNP100nm@lipid
systems were 94, 56, 111, 121, and 124. The EF values of AuNP5nm@lipid systems were relatively higher than those of AuNP100nm@lipid systems: the EF values at 714, 1668, 2852, 2872,
and 2930 cm–1 were 129.3 ± 7.5, 128.2 ±
35.3, 131.3 ± 20.5, 139.4 ± 22.4, and 139.2 ± 21.2,
respectively. High concentrations of lipids affected the low uptake
of small AuNPs in the inner lipid membrane,46 which mirrored MSERS signals where the hot spot was not visible
in high lipid concentration areas, owing to the proper distance of
AuNPs to provide hot spot. In addition, as opposed to supported lipid
bilayer systems,47 this method can be an
alternative method to investigate the molecular behaviors on the interior
membrane region.

Investigation of Membrane Fluidity and Polarity
of AuNP@Lipid
In another viewpoint, we estimated the membrane
fluidity and polarity of the lipid membrane of lipid-coated AuNPs.
The incorporation of Chol dose dependently decreased the membrane
fluidity of the fluid bilayer membranes.35,38 On this basis, the membrane fluidity and polarity of AuNP@lipid
systems were investigated (Figure 4). The results confirmed that the membrane of AuNP@lipid
systems was almost similar to DOPC/Chol (60/40) liposome (particle-free
lipid bilayer system). Thus, the membrane composition of AuNP@lipid
could be DOPC/Chol (60/40), as expected. Compared with the DOPC/Chol
liposome as a reference, the membrane properties of AuNP@lipid systems
were almost similar to those of liposome systems. Thus, it is assumed
that 1-octanethiol hardly disturbs the membrane formation. Herein,
DPH and Laurdan were applied to prepared AuNP@lipid systems, and the
1/P and GP340 values were calculated on
previous reports.35,38 By comparing the difference of
membrane properties between AuNP-modified membranes and pure liposomes,
it is possible to discuss whether the insertion of AuNPs alters the
apparent membrane properties or not.

All samples were measured at 25 °C. At least three reproducible
spectra were obtained for each system. Error bar represents a standard
deviation of each data.

For AuNP100nm@lipid system, the lipid membrane leaflet was attached on the 1-octanethiol-functionalized
AuNP100nm; thus, a whole membrane area could be influenced
by AuNP100nm. The results of fluorescent probe studies
(1/P and GP340) indicated no significant
influence on the modification of AuNP100nm. This suggests
that the hot spot can be constructed between Chol-enriched domain,
and then, the Raman enhancement could be preferentially induced at
the Chol-enriched domain. However, AuNP100nm@lipid is not
suitable for charged membranes because the electrostatic repulsion
inhibits the contact between particles (data not shown). Usually,
the lipid/probe ratio ≈ 100/1 is employed because the excess
amount of fluorescent probes might disturb the membrane properties.
In AuNP5nm@lipid systems, slight differences of membrane
fluidity and polarity could be caused by the insertion of AuNP. It
is also notable that the membrane fluidity and polarity are significantly
altered by the amount of Chol.34,35,38 Therefore, possible reasons are that (1) the presence of AuNP5nm slightly made the membrane disordered or that (2) Chol
molecules could be accumulated around AuNP5nm, and the
relative Chol amount in the membrane slightly decreased. The membrane
can be segregated into DOPC-enriched domain [liquid-disordered phase]
and Chol-enriched [liquid-ordered (lo) phase] domain. It
is assumed that AuNP5nm could be interactive with Chol-enriched
domain; as a result, the lo-phase preferred Raman enhancement
can be obtained. Although further investigations are needed, the AuNP5nm@lipid system is potentially applicable for various systems,
including the membranes modified with charged species.

Investigation
of Lipid Membrane Properties Based on Raman
In Raman analysis
for lipid membranes, both fingerprint (500–2000 cm–1) and C–H stretching regions (2700–3100 cm–1) can be used to know the properties of lipid membranes.48−51 Because the peaks at 2850 and 2890 cm–1 correspond
to the symmetric and asymmetric vibrational modes of the −CH2– group, the peak intensity ratio, R = I2890/I2852, is indicative of the hydrocarbon chain packing density.49 The fingerprint region of the Raman spectrum,
in approximately the 1000–1200 cm–1 range,
is known to be a highly sensitive range for reporting chain–chain
interactions (chain torsion: S = I1090/I1120).51 Furthermore, the Chol peak independently appears at 2872
cm–1, and the peak ratio of I2872/I2852 reflects the Chol amount
in the membrane (see Figure S3). On these
bases, the MSERS signals obtained by AuNP@lipid systems are compared
with liposome (Figure 5). In common to AuNP100nm@lipid, AuNP5nm@lipid,
and liposome, they resulted in the values of R <
1 and S > 1, indicating the liquid phase49 because of the membrane composition of DOPC/Chol
(60/40). The Chol amount of AuNP5nm@lipid seems to be slightly
higher than the liposome systems. MSERS of AuNP100nm@lipid
systems indicated the most ordered membrane properties. This could
be due to the location of AuNPs: AuNP5nm, which might be
accumulated into Chol-enriched domain (i.e., lo phase).
Given that Chol could be heterogeneously distributed in membranes,
the hot spot generated in AuNP100nm@lipid systems could
be a Chol-enriched domain, wherein the membrane is relatively ordered
because of enriched Chol.

Figure 5 Analyses of lipid membrane properties by Raman.
(a) Chain packing, R = I2890/I2852. (b) Chain torsion, S = I1090/I1120. (c) Chol amount, I2872/I2852. Lipid compositions were DOPC/Chol (60/40). All samples
were measured at 25 °C. At least three reproducible spectra were
obtained for each system. Error bar represents a standard deviation
of each data.

The Raman intensity of liposome
at the total lipid concentration below 10 mM was so weak and usually
under the detection limit. Because MSERS measurements were performed
at a total concentration below 1 mM, the EF values strongly depend
on whether the hot spot is generated or not. The hot spot of AuNP100nm@lipid could be induced between the contacted surfaces
of AuNP100nm@lipid particles, whereas the octanethiol-functionalized
AuNP5nm could be incorporated into lipid membranes and
then could induce the hot spot inside the membrane. Although further
studies are required to investigate the critical reasons for the SERS
intensity differences between peaks, the AuNP5nm@lipid
systems could induce relatively stronger peaks in the finger print
regions as compared to AuNP5nm@lipid systems. The incorporation
of AuNP5nm induced the membrane lipids exiting closely
to the AuNPs, which could increase the Raman signals.

Conclusions
The AuNP-modified DOPC/Chol self-assemblies were prepared to obtain
SERS. The Raman signals at the fingerprint region obtained in AuNP5nm@lipid systems were slightly stronger than those obtained
in AuNP100nm@lipid systems. The membrane properties of
AuNP@lipid systems and liposomes were compared; in fluorescent probe
studies, negligible differences were observed between AuNP100nm@lipid and liposome, while the Raman peak intensity analyses suggest
the enhanced Chol signals in AuNP100nm@lipid. The hot spot
of AuNP100nm@lipid could be induced between the contacted
surfaces of AuNP100nm@lipid particles, whereas the octanethiol-functionalized
AuNP5nm could be incorporated into lipid membranes and
then could induce the hot spot inside the membrane. Considering these
results, the AuNP100nm@lipid and AuNP5nm@lipid
systems can be applied to analyze the surface and inner membrane regions,
respectively.

This approach will shed lights in characterizing
liquid-ordered versus liquid-disordered membrane phases and in detecting
the AuNP-associated lipids in membrane systems. Considering the results
obtained in this work, slight differences were observed both in fluorescent
probe analyses and in SERS. Given an interaction between AuNPs and
lipid (or lipid membrane), it can be suggested that (1) AuNP5nm itself disturbs the membrane ordering and (2) the insertion of AuNP5nm altered the distribution of Chol in the membrane. From
a relatively stronger Chol signal in AuNP100nm@lipid systems,
a direct interaction between AuNPs and lipid (especially Chol) should
be considered. Although careful studies are required to get more accurate
information about AuNP-modified lipid membrane, the SERS method has
potential to investigate a wide variety of fractional contents of
Chol in membranes and at low lipid/AuNP ratio for a specific application.
