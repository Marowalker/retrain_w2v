In electroless nickel–phosphorus
plating (ENPP), growth
of the plated layer under high pressure was found to be faster than
under ambient pressure. To quantitatively elucidate the effect of
high pressure on the mechanism of the ENPP reaction, we propose a
kinetic model that takes into account both mass transfer and reaction
of the chemical species present in the plating solution. We solved
the mass balance equations between the chemical species to calculate
the transient changes in the thickness of the plated layer as well
as the concentrations of the chemical species in the plating solution.
By fitting the calculated results to the experimentally acquired results
based on the nonlinear least square method, we determined such parameters
as the film mass transfer coefficient, the adsorption constants, and
the reaction rate constants of the chemical species in the model.
As a result, we found that the film mass transfer coefficient under
high pressure was greater than that under ambient pressure and revealed
the dependence of the coefficient on pressure. The transient changes
in the concentrations of the chemical species in the plating solution
that we calculated based on the kinetic model employing our estimated
parameters closely modeled the experimental results with the determination
coefficients being mostly over 99%.

1 Introduction
New developments in the science and technology of high pressure
are increasingly being applied to industrial processes such as isostatic
pressing, hydrothermal synthesis, and pressure crystallization. Isostatic
pressing is a molding method that produces densely compacted and crystallized
ceramics or metals in industrial alloy fabrication.1 Li et al. employed isostatic pressing followed by plastic
extrusion to prepare tubular-type membranes composed of densely compacted
perovskite.2 The carbon and graphite industry
has developed high-pressure molding techniques at elevated temperatures
to obtain homogeneous and refined graphite materials to use as arc
light electrodes.3 As recently reviewed
by Bazargan et al.,4 high-pressure techniques
have the potential to produce novel carbon materials, such as spheres,
prolate spheroids, and nanotubes with varying morphologies and physical
properties. Hydrothermal syntheses of porous solids with periodic
mesostructures were recently reviewed by Mandal and Landskron.5 Nanocasting under high pressure is an efficient
method that enables the preservation of periodic mesostructures during
the liquid-to-solid phase transformation of the starting materials.
Li et al. employed Raman spectroscopy in an in situ study on the solubility
of ionic liquids in methanol under pressures of up to 2 GPa.6 They reported the coexistence of two different
crystalline phases of the ionic liquids. In the crystallization of
amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) under pressures of up to 640 MPa,
the water content as well as the crystallinity of the prepared ACC
solids depends on the added pressure.7 Moritoki
et al. summarized the features of high-pressure crystallization processes
in industrial processes.8 They reported
that pressure is the driving parameter not only for crystallization
but also for separation and purification of individual components
from a mixture.

Electroless plating is a useful technique for
forming a metal-plated
layer on the surface of various solids, including nonconductors such
as ceramics or plastics, without employing an external power source.9−11 It is an autocatalytic chemical deposition method in the sense that
the deposited metal is catalytically responsive to the oxidation reaction
of a reducing agent, which leads to the continuous growth of the plated
layer. A plated layer with the desired thickness can easily be formed,
even on surfaces with complicated shapes, by controlling, for example,
the plating time. Brenner and Riddel developed a practical electroless
nickel plating method as a result of their discovery that hypophosphite
can reduce the ionic form of nickel species to their metallic form.12 In contrast to conventional reducing agents
such as tetrahydroborate or dimethylamineborane, hypophosphite is
inexpensive and is stable in the plating solution. Of the different
types of electroless plating methods, electroless nickel–phosphorus
plating (ENPP)13,14 has the advantages of corrosion
resistance as well as a fast deposition rate. ENPP is increasingly
applied industrially in the manufacture of automobiles, electronic
devices, and precision instruments. The conditions for ENPP are being
intensively studied to further improve the cost efficiency and characteristics
of the plated layer.15,16 Although it is possible to control
the thickness of the plated layer by changing the operating conditions
such as time, temperature, and stirring rate in the plating bath,
the key aim is to form a plated layer that is free from defects. The
oxidation reaction of a reducing agent, which is employed in ENPP
to supply electrons for the reduction of metal ion species in a plating
solution, is accompanied by the evolution of hydrogen. In the ENPP
process under ambient pressure, hydrogen bubbles are generated on
the surface of the plated layer during the oxidation reaction of the
reducing agent, sometimes resulting in roughness of or defects in
the plated layer. On the other hand, if ENPP is performed under high
pressure, the hydrogen generated by the plating reaction instead dissolves
in the plating solution. As a consequence, hydrogen bubbles, which
inhibit the mass transfer of the chemical species involved in the
plating reaction from the plating solution to the plated surface,
are not formed. In a previous study, we confirmed that the average
plating rate under an elevated pressure of 20 MPa was about 1.5 times
faster than that under ambient pressure.17 High pressure was also found effective to form a smoother plated
surface layer. The result might be also attributed to the equilibrium
shift in the reaction to generate hydrogen (2H+ + 2e– ⇔ H2) from right to left. However,
to date, little has been known of the mechanism of the plating reaction
under high pressure or of the effects that high pressure has on the
plating reaction. Kinetic modeling of the reaction, however, is a
promising and useful method for revealing the effects of high pressure
on the mass transfer of the chemical species in the plating solution
as well as the formation of the plated surface.

In various chemical
reactions, kinetic modeling has been applied
to quantitatively evaluate the effects of operating conditions on
the reaction mechanism. Nguyen et al. employed the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
model, which considers both liquid–vapor mass transfer and
competitive adsorption of the reactants, products, and solvents on
γ-Al2O3 or amorphous silica–alumina-supported
NiMo catalysts to gain an understanding of the hydrodenitrogenation
of quinoline in a batch reactor. Kinetic modeling of the reaction
revealed the hydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline into decahydroquinoline
to be the rate-determining step in the principal reaction pathway.18 In a mass transport process of toxic chemical
vapors employing an activated carbon fiber cloth, Lordgooei et al.
considered the effective diffusivities in the adsorbents as a function
of temperature, the concentration, and the pore size distribution
to build a dispersive computational model for industrial applications.19 For a system of water droplets dispersed in
oil containing the synthetic surfactants tetracarboxylic acid (BP10)
and decanoic acid (DA), Kovalchuc et al. built a multicomponent mass
transport model to determine the interfacial composition and bulk
phase concentration of the surfactants. By employing a molecular-mixed
monolayer adsorption model that was parameterized in molecular dynamic
simulation and interfacial tension experiments, they revealed that
the interfacial composition of BP10 and DA closely depended on the
surface-to-volume ratio of the system.20

In this study, we aim to clarify the effects of high pressure
on
ENPP. To solve the mass balance equations of the chemical species
involved in the ENPP reaction, we propose a kinetic model considering
both mass transfer and the reactions of the chemical species in a
plating solution. By comparing the results that we numerically calculate
based on the model with the experimental data, we determine such parameters
in the model as the film mass transfer coefficient of the chemical
species on the growing surface of the plated layer, the adsorption
constants, and the reaction rate constants. We then discuss the effect
of the pressure on the reaction mechanism of the ENPP and the quality
of the plated layer.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Electroless Nickel–Phosphorus Plating
Figure 1 shows a
schematic image of the high-pressure apparatus employed in this study.
First, a degreased and pickled copper piece, 10 mm wide and 20 mm
high, with the thickness of 0.3 mm was placed in a tubular glass cell
with 3 mL of a plating solution that contained the chemical species
listed in Table 1.
The effective surface-to-volume ratio, a, of the
copper piece is estimated to be 6.67 × 103 m2·m–3, based on the surface area (4.0 ×
10–4 m2) considering its both sides and
the volume (6.0 × 10–8 m3.) The
cell was placed in the high-pressure vessel, which was then pressurized
employing a liquid supplying pump with a syringe-type pressure amplifier.
As depicted in Figure 1, the area of the upper surface of the cylinder in the pressure amplifier
was 20 times as great as that of the lower surface. The pressure added
by the pump was multiplied 20-fold using the pressure amplifier to
achieve the desired pressure P which we varied from
0 to 200 MPa. P indicates the pressure added to the
vessel before elevating the temperature. To initiate the plating reaction,
the solution was heated to 343 K by circulating hot water between
the thermostat bath and high-pressure vessel. By elevating the temperature,
the pressure inside the vessel increased to a certain extent. The
plated layer, composed of metallic nickel and nickel–phosphorus
alloy, was then deposited on both surfaces of the piece. We varied
the reaction time from 600 to 4800 s. The reaction was terminated
by cooling the high-pressure vessel to 298 K. The pressure inside
the vessel was then gradually decreased to ambient pressure. Under
atmospheric pressure (P = 0 MPa), generation of hydrogen
bubbles could be observed on the surface of a copper piece. The size
and number of the bubbles on the surface were measured employing a
pen-type camera (CJK-01, MK Electronics Corp.). Under the other pressure
examined in this study, we observed no bubbles on the copper piece.

hydrogen bubbles on the surface of a copper piece under atmospheric
pressure (P = 0 MPa).

Finally,
we measured the increase in the mass of the piece subjected
to the plating reaction to determine the average thickness, δ,
of the plated layer according to the following eq 1 1  where M1, M2, A, and
ρ are the weight of copper piece after plating, the weight of
copper piece before plating, the surface area (4.0 × 10–4 m2) of a copper piece of both sides, and the average
density (7.63 × 103 kg·m–3)
of the plated layer, respectively.

2.2 Chemical
Reactions in Electroless Nickel–Phosphorus
Plating
In a typical electroless plating process, small catalytic
sites must be introduced onto the substrate prior to the reaction
to serve as nuclei for the plated layer growth.21 To initiate the plating reaction, we employ a cylindrical
aluminum stick with a length of 100 mm and a diameter of 3 mm as the
trigger to initiate the plating reaction. The electroless plating
reaction is driven by the ionization tendency of the relevant metal
species. In the case of this study, by attaching the aluminum stick
to the surface of the copper piece, aluminum is ionized to supply
electrons to noble metal, nickel. Eqs 2–5 are elementary reactions
with regard to the deposition of the plated layer. Initially, electrons
generated by the oxidation of metallic aluminum reduce nickel cations
to metallic nickel, which acts as a catalyst for the further reduction
of nickel cations. Thus, the reduction of the nickel cation is an
autocatalytic reaction. Then, as expressed by eq 2, the hypophosphite anion is reduced to a
phosphite anion and supplies electrons. As a result, the reactions
expressed by eqs 3–5 proceed simultaneously. The plated layer deposited
on the copper piece is an alloy composed of Ni and Ni2P.
As the reaction progresses under ambient pressure, hydrogen is evolved
and forms bubbles on the surface of the plated layerreaction in the
liquid phase 2  reaction

2.3 Quantitative Analysis of Chemical Species
The concentrations
of both hypophosphite (H2PO2–) and phosphite (H2PO3–)
anions in the plating solution were measured employing
an ion chromatograph equipped with an electric conductivity detector
(Model IA-100, DKK-TOA Corp) and an anion exchange column (Model I-524A,
Showa Denko K.K.) at 313 K. The eluent was 0.001 mol·dm–3 DL-tartaric acid. The measurement was performed at intervals of
15 min under a constant eluent flow of 5.35 mL·min–1. The concentration of each anion was determined based on a calibration
curve that was plotted using sodium phosphinate monohydrate for H2PO2– and disodium hydrogen phosphite
pentahydrate for H2PO3–, respectively.
The concentration of the residual nickel cation was determined from
the mass and the phosphorus content of the plated layer. The phosphorus
content of the plated layer was determined to be 12% as a result of
measurements by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).

3 Kinetic Modeling
3.1 Mass Transfer at the Solid–Liquid
Interface
(SLI)
As depicted in Figure 2, a kinetic model was built to account for the mass
transfer of the chemical species in the vicinity of the SLI, which
was the growing surface of the plated layer formed on the surface
of the copper piece. The kinetic parameters employed in the model
are summarized in Table 2.

3.2 Assumptions
The
mass balances of
the cation and anion species were considered based on the following
general and transport assumptions(1) General assumptions(i) The plating solution in the cell is
homogeneous. In the case of atmospheric pressure (P = 0 MPa), the volume of generated hydrogen gas (2 vol % max.) can
be neglected compared to that of the plating solution.

(ii) All surface areas of the copper piece
contribute to adsorption and reaction of the chemical species except
for the case under atmospheric pressure (P = 0 MPa).
In the said case, the generation of hydrogen bubbles on the piece
results in the decrease of the available surface area for mass transfer
of the species. The ratio (13%) of the decreased available area which
we determined by observing the bubbles to the total surface areas
of the piece is taken into account by correcting kla with the ratio.

(iii) The volume and temperature of the
solution are constant.

(iv) The linear adsorption model with
the constant Kad is employed to account
for the distributions of both H2PO2– and Ni2+ at the SLI as expressed by the eqs 6 and 7, while
H2PO3– does not adsorb onto
the SLI. 6   7  

(v) The density of the plated layer is
constant, irrespective of its thickness, and is equal to 7.63 g·cm–3, which is calculated from the atomic ratio between
phosphorus and nickel based on the results of energy-dispersive X-ray
analysis.



(2) Transport assumptions

The molar
flux of an ionic species in a dilute solution is composed of two terms,
one corresponding to the molar diffusion according to Fick’s
law and the other to the electrophoretic migration.22 The second term is equal to zero if the electrical charge
density is equal to zero.22 The charge
densities of cations and anions in the plating solution versus time
were calculated from eqs 8 and 9, respectively, under the condition of P = 30 MPa. The values are presented in Figure 3.

Cation charge density 8  

Anion charge density 9  

In eqs 8 and 9, the concentrations of each ionic species, except
for spectator ions (, vary according to the chemical reactions
expressed by eqs 3–5 and the dissociation equilibria of the plating solution
additives.23 The dissociation equilibrium
of each additive in the plating solution is summarized in Table 3.23 In Figure 3, the transient changes of the charge density of cations and anions
are almost the same, although a small discrepancy between the results
is observed from 1200 s. Hence, as the first approximation, the electrical
charge density of the solution can be considered to be almost zero
during the plating reaction. The assumption (i) can be formulated.(i) A linear driving
force (LDF) approximation
is adequate to represent the transfer of ionic species in the vicinity
of the plated layer under the conditions examined in this study.

(ii) kla is
the only
parameter that depends on pressure. The other parameters (Kad1, Kad2, k1, k2, and k3) are independent of it.

(iii) The volumetric mass transfer coefficient, kla, in the liquid film is assumed to be the same for H2PO2– and Ni2+ based
on the relation between the two diffusion coefficients,24,25 as follows 10

3.3 Mass Balance Equations
Based on the
model and assumptions explained in the previous sections, the mass
balances between the cation and anion species contained in the plating
solution can be expressed by the following eqs 11–17

phosphite anion, nickel phosphide, and metallic nickel, respectively.
The subscripts “liq”, “sol”, and “ads”
indicate the liquid phase, solid phase, and adsorbed species, while Vsol and Vliq are
the volumes of the solid phase (plated layer) and the liquid phase
(plating solution), respectively.

3.4 Model
Fitting and Parameters
First,
six parameters (kla, Kad1, Kad2, k1, k2, and k3) are estimated for the experimental data collected at P = 30 MPa (data points = 36), the lowest pressure at which the evolution
of hydrogen bubbles was suppressed. Then, one parameter (kla) is estimated for the other experimental data collected under pressures
of P = 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 MPa (the number of
data points is 36 for each) using the MATLAB nonlinear least square
solver function “lsqnonlin” with the trust-region-reflective
algorithm (the stopping criteria 10–6 is included
in the algorithm by default). This minimizes an objective function
based on an input vector of the difference between the measured and
calculated data. The uncertainty interval (ui) of each parameter vector
(p) is determined from the standard
calculation method assuming that errors in the data are normally distributed
and bearing in mind the nonlinearity of this model. The lsqnonlin
Jacobian output matrix, J, is used to calculate the
Hessian matrix as expressed by eq 18. 18  

The Hessian matrix
diagonal is used to calculate the standard error, se(pi), for parameter pi by eq 19 with the residue of
the sum of the errors squared, the number of data points (nd) and the number of parameters (np). 19  From eq 19 and the
student variable, snd – np, which gives
the statistical significance of each
parameter, the uncertainty interval of each parameter can be calculated
according to eq 20.26 20  

4 Results
and Discussion
4.1 Parameters Estimated with
the Kinetic Model
The estimated parameters and associated
uncertainty intervals are
summarized in Table 4. kla was revealed to be the most sensitive of the
six parameters involved in the kinetic model. The estimated parameter kla is estimated with high accuracy, while the adsorption
coefficients (Kad1 and Kad2) are estimated with low accuracy. The experiments
are very sensitive to kla but few to adsorption coefficients,
which means that the adsorption/desorption is not the rate-determining
step. For experimental data obtained at other pressures, Kad1, Kad2, k1, k2, and k3 were fixed and only kla was estimated.
Under the assumption that the idea of the Hatta number (Ha), which
had been applied to consider the gas–liquid mass transfer in
a gas absorption system,22 was applicable
to the system (liquid–solid mass transfer) of this study also,
the number could be estimated as Ha = 3.4 × 10–5 based on the values of, for example, kla = 13.96
s–1 and k1 = 4.657 ×
10–4 s–1. Hence, it can be considered
that the plating reaction is the rate-determining step of the mass
transfer around the SLI and that the effect of the reaction on the
concentration distribution in the liquid film shown in Figure 2 is negligible. The values
of kla and associated uncertainty intervals are shown
in Table 5. For all
experiments, the residue of numerical optimization and the correlation
coefficient between the calculated results with experimental data
are given in Table 6.

4.2 Electroless Nickel–Phosphorus Plating
The transient
changes in both the thickness of the plated layer
and the concentration of the chemical species contained in the plating
solution were measured and also calculated numerically by solving
the mass balance equations between the chemical species in the plating
solution. Figure 4 shows
experimental and calculated transient changes in the thickness of
the plated layer under different pressures.

Figure 4 Transient changes of
the thickness of the plated layer prepared
under the different pressures, symbol: experimental data, dashed line:
calculated result.

As depicted in Figure 4, the thickness of
the plated layer steadily increases with
time. Since the plating reaction examined in this study is a batch
reaction, the transient change in the thickness of the plated layer
becomes small with the progress of the reaction. It is found that
growth of the plated layer terminates at about 5000 s when almost
all the hypophosphite anion is consumed. It is evident that the growth
of the plated layer under the condition of P ≥
30 MPa is faster than that for P = 0 MPa. It should
be noted that the growth of the plated layer shows a unique dependency
on the added pressure. The fastest growth is seen at P = 50 MPa. As can be confirmed from Figure 5, the average plating rate under the condition
of P = 50 MPa is approximately 20% greater than that
for P = 0 MPa. These results can be explained by
the following two conflicting effects: (i) suppression of the evolution
of hydrogen bubbles at P ≥ 30 MPa, and (ii)
higher viscosity of the plating solution with increased P in the range of P ≥ 50 MPa. The absence
of hydrogen bubbles at the SLI facilitates mass transfer of the reaction
components, resulting in accelerated growth of the plated layer. Moreover,
raising the pressure eliminates hydrogen bubble formation and, as
a consequence, reduces defects in the plated layer surface. It follows
that this provides an effective method to improve corrosion resistivity,
which is different to the methods tested in previous studies.15,27 On the other hand, the increase in the viscosity of the plating
solution appears to slow the growth of the plated layer. The effect
of pressure on the viscosity of liquid can be explained by the natural
convection equation on a vertical flat plate.

Figure 5 Effect of pressure during
the plating reaction on kla (left axis) and plating
rate (right axis).

With regard to mass transfer
by natural convection on a vertical
flat plate, the three dimensionless numbers, i.e., the Sherwood number
(Sh), the Grashof number (Gr), and the Schmidt number (Sc), are defined
by the following eqs 21–24 21  and 22   23   24  where Δc, D, g, kl, L, β, μ, and ρ are, respectively, the
difference in concentration, diffusion coefficient, acceleration of
gravity, mass transfer coefficient, characteristic length, coefficient
of thermal expansion, viscosity of the solution, and density of the
solution. Viscosity of a solution depends not only on pressure but
also on the composition.28 Because the
concentrations of the chemical species contained in the plating solution,
which is employed in this study, are low as summarized in Table 1, it is assumed that
the viscosity of the solution is equal to that of water. By combining
the eqs 21–24, we have derived the following eq 25, which indicates that the increase
in the viscosity of the solution results in the decrease in the mass
transfer at the SLI28 25  where α (Pa·m)
is the constant. A range of empirical equations are available to estimate
water viscosity under the different temperatures and pressures.28−30Eq 26 was selected
as it allows water viscosity to be predicted to within 3% under the
experimental conditions examined in this study29 26  where the
first factor μ0®(T̅)
depends only on temperature,
the second factor μ1®(T̅,ρ̅) represents the density contribution, while the third
factor μ2®(T̅,ρ̅)
represents the enhancement of the viscosity near the critical point.
The variables in the eq 27 are dimensionless as follows29 27  

The methods used to determine the
above factors were previously
reported.29 To predict the density of water
in the range smaller than 0.5ρc, as expressed by
the eq 28, the simplified
form of the Virial equation is derived by truncating after the third
term30 28  where P,
ρ, R, and T are pressure,
the density of water, the specific gas constant, and temperature,
respectively. The Virial coefficients in eq 28 are β(T) = −1.705
× 10–2 m3·kg–1 and C(T) = 1.639 × 10–5 m6·kg–2, respectively, determined
from literature data.31 The average error
in the estimation of density using eq 28 is below 0.25%. Under the experimental conditions
(ρ̅ < 0.5) examined in this study, it can be assumed 29  

By employing the physical properties of water29 summarized in Table 7, the relation between pressures in the range
from 0 to 200
MPa with the viscosity of water is derived as shown in Figure 6. The average errors in the
estimation of water viscosity by an IAPWS model29 and our viscosity model are 3 and 3.4%, respectively. The
main difference between the two models comes from the Virial coefficient
values. Some experimental values32 are
added to Figure 6 to
show the accuracy of the employed model. The calculated result and
experimental data are in good agreement. The average error in the
experimental values is only 0.7% according to the literature.31 The employed model is thus validated.

4.3 Results of Simulation and Comparison with
Experimental Data
Based on our proposed kinetic model taking
into account both the mass transfer and the chemical reactions in
the vicinity of the growing surface of the plated layer, the transient
changes of the thickness of the plated layer and the concentrations
of the reaction components were simulated. As far as the authors have
investigated, to date, with regard to the mechanism of the ENPP, the
growth of the plated layer has not yet been discussed based on the
mass balance equations between the reaction components. It is evident
that the greater growth rate of the plated layer is the result of
the greater consumption rate of the reaction components, such as the
hypophosphite anion and nickel cation. The volumetric mass transfer
coefficient kla (Figure 5) was numerically estimated by fitting the
calculated thickness of the plated layer (Figure 4) and the concentration of the chemical species
to the experimental data, which was measured under a different value
of P (Figure 7). In the numerical optimization to ascertain the solution
of the parameters, it was confirmed, as summarized in Table 5, that the error was sufficiently
small. As depicted in Figure 5, it should be noted that kla reached a peak
under the condition of P = 50 MPa in the examined
range from 0 to 200 MPa. The dependence of kla on
pressure (left axis) is quite similar to that of the plating rate
(right axis) as also depicted in Figure 5. The mass transfer coefficient, kl, can be estimated by dividing kla with
the effective surface-to-volume ratio, a (m2·m–3). Considering the thickness of the substrate,
the values of a were determined as 6.67 × 103 m2·m–3 for cases with no
bubble and 5.8 × 103 m2·m–3 for cases with a bubble, respectively. By applying eq 25 to thus attained kl and μ, which was estimated from the relation shown in Figure 6, the constant α
in eq 25 could be determined
as α = 8.56 × 10–7 Pa·m. Using the
six parameters determined using the nonlinear least square method,
the transient changes in the thickness of the plated layer and the
concentration of the chemical species were calculated. Figures 4 and 7a–c show that the calculated results closely coincided with
the experimental data, with the determination coefficients being mostly
over 99% as summarized in Table 6.

[Ni2+] under the different plating pressures, dashed line:
calculated result, solid symbol: experimental data.

The deviations of the calculated results from the experimental
data in Figure 7 could
be explained in terms of the limitation of LDF approximation for ionic
systems. Although the electrical charge density was assumed to be
equal to zero, the small discrepancy observed in Figure 3 could explain the deviations
of the Figure 7. Indeed,
Grimes and Liapis33 have shown that the
electrophoretic mass transport due to electrical charge density can
have a strong influence on total ionic species transport in the liquid
film. To fit the calculated result to the experimental data in Figure 7 with higher accuracy,
it could be necessary to consider the electrophoretic mass transport
of the different ionic species in the kinetic model.33

5 Conclusions
Electroless
nickel–phosphorus plating (ENPP) under high
pressure is a novel and effective method for suppressing the evolution
of hydrogen bubbles during the plating reaction under ambient pressure
and which may cause defects such as pinholes or nodules in the plated
layer. In this study, we examined the effects of high pressure on
the formation of the plated layer based on the mass balance equations
of the chemical species relevant to the evolution of hydrogen. To
simulate the plating reaction, we developed a kinetic model that took
into account both mass transfer and the reactions of the chemical
species on the growing surface of the plated layer or the solid–liquid
interface (SLI). By fitting the simulated results to the experimental
ones, based on the nonlinear least square method, we were able to
determine the mass transfer coefficient or kla of
the chemical species at the SLI. As a result, we confirmed that the
kinetic model can account for the two conflicting effects of high
pressure on ENPP: (i) acceleration of mass transfer as a result of
the suppression of hydrogen bubbles, and (ii) deceleration of mass
transfer as a result of the higher viscosity of the plating solution.
Using our determined kla, we numerically calculated
the transient changes in the thickness of the plated layer and the
concentrations of the chemical species. These were very similar to
the experimental data. In a subsequent study, we will examine the
effects of pressure on the adsorption kinetics of the chemical species
on the SLI in our proposed model. The applicability of the model to
the other plating processes will also be studied.
