Polyaniline@graphene/nickel
oxide (Pani@GN/NiO), polyaniline/graphene
(Pani/GN), and polyaniline/nickel oxide (Pani/NiO) nanocomposites
and polyaniline (Pani) were successfully synthesized and tested for
ammonia sensing. Pani@GN/NiO, Pani/NiO, Pani/GN, and Pani were characterized
using X-ray diffraction, UV–vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy,
scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.
The as-prepared materials were studied for comparative dc electrical
conductivity and the change in their electrical conductivity on exposure
to ammonia vapors followed by ambient air at room temperature. It
was observed that the incorporation of GN/NiO in Pani showed about
99 times greater amplitude of conductivity change than pure Pani on
exposure to ammonia vapors followed by ambient air. The fast response
and excellent recovery time could probably be ascribed to the relatively
high surface area of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite, proper sensing
channels, and efficaciously available active sites. Pani@GN/NiO was
observed to show better selectivity toward ammonia because of the
comparatively high basic nature of ammonia than other volatile organic
compounds tested. The sensing mechanism was explained on the basis
of the simple acid–base chemistry of Pani.

==== Body
Introduction
A variety of materials
such as carbon nanomaterials, inorganic
semiconductors, and conjugated polymers have been explored to fabricate
gas/vapor sensors.1−7 Conducting polymer-based sensors have high sensitivity because of
the large surface area, fast response, lower power consumption, small
size, and lightweight. Among them, polyaniline (Pani) is considered
to be the most promising and widely applied sensing material because
of its low cost, easy preparation, high environmental stability, tuneable
electrical properties, and unique functions by controlled charge-transfer
processes.8−10 However, its low sensitivity and inadequate thermal
stability still restrict its application in operable sensors. In order
to improve the sensing performance of Pani, many efforts have been
made by loading the noble metals, semiconductors, and other components
to develop composite materials.11−13 Recently, nickel oxide (NiO)
nanoparticles have drawn considerable attention because of their low
price, acceptable sensing properties, and good environmental stability.
Researchers developed gas sensors based on NiO films which have demonstrated
significant sensing properties.14 Because
of its high resistivity, there is still drawback in using NiO in composite
materials for practical sensing applications. To overcome this problem,
many carbonaceous materials with high electrical conductivity have
been introduced to prepare carbon/NiO nanocomposites.15

A number of composites of Pani have been reported
with metal oxides,
metal nanoparticles, graphene (GN), and carbon nanotubes widely used
in gas sensing applications.16

Also,
many other nanocomposites have also been reported as ammonia
sensors.17−21 We have decorated NiO nanoparticles on GN sheets, which increases
the resultant surface area. The material obtained GN/NiO nanocomposite
is also conductive with enhanced surface area, which may be a suitable
material for making conducting nanocomposites with Pani for the purpose
of gas/vapor sensing studies.

In this work, the polyaniline@graphene/nickel
oxide (Pani@GN/NiO)
nanocomposite was selected and studied as an ammonia sensor by examining
the dynamic response of electrical conductivity using a simple four-in-line-probe
dc electrical conductivity measurement setup.

Results and Discussion
X-ray
Diffraction Studies
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra
of Pani, polyaniline/nickel oxide (Pani/NiO), polyaniline/graphene
(Pani/GN), and Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposites are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1a exhibits the XRD spectrum of Pani, which
has two characteristic broad peaks at 2θ = 20.31° and 25.23°.
The XRD spectrum of Pani/GN has broad peaks similar to those for Pani
slightly shifted to 2θ = 20.45° and 25.27°, which
is attributed to the presence of GN in the Pani/GN nanocomposite,
as shown in Figure 1b. In Figure 1c, there
are five extra sharp peaks along with characteristic broad peaks of
Pani (at 2θ = 20.25° and 25.34°), which are observed
at 2θ = 37.42°, 43.35°, 62.86°, 75.26°,
and 79.42°, respectively, attributed to the presence of NiO nanoparticles
in the Pani/NiO nanocomposite. The XRD spectrum of the Pani@GN/NiO
nanocomposite is similar to that of the Pani/NiO nanocomposite, as
shown in Figure 1d.
The peaks due to Pani at 2θ = 20.05° and 25.69°, respectively,
shifted from 2θ = 20.31° and 25.23°, which may be
attributed to the interaction of Pani with NiO embedded on GN sheets.
The five intense peaks observed in the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite at
2θ = 37.13°, 43.48°, 63.12°, 75.39°, and
79.56° may be ascribed to the (111), (200), (322), (311), and
(222) planes, respectively, due to the reflection of NiO deposited
on GN sheets with a slight shift compared to those in the Pani/NiO
nanocomposite, indicating the successful preparation of the Pani@GN/NiO
nanocomposite.22,23

Scanning Electron Microscopy Studies
Figure 2 presents the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of Pani, Pani/NiO, Pani/GN, and Pani@GN/NiO
nanocomposites. The SEM images of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite demonstrated
the sheet-type morphology due to the presence of GN/NiO, as shown
in Figure 2a,b. However,
the NiO nanoparticles deposited on GN sheets are not visible here,
which indicates that the NiO nanoparticles deposited on GN sheets
have a nucleating effect on the polymerization of aniline and are
completely covered by the Pani shell. Figure 2c,d presents the SEM images of Pani, which
seems to possess a nanotubelike morphology. Figure 2e presents the SEM image of the Pani/NiO
nanocomposite, in which the polymer matrix is well deposited on NiO
nanoparticles and the Pani is agglomerated by several nanoparticles.
In Figure 2f, it may
clearly be seen that the Pani is well deposited on GN, giving some
sheetlike morphology in the Pani/GN nanocomposite.

Transmission Electron Microscopy Studies
The morphologies
of Pani@GN/NiO, Pani/NiO, Pani/GN, and Pani were further analyzed
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Figure 3. In this synthesis, we deposited
NiO nanoparticles on GN sheet and then aniline monomers were polymerized
on the surface of GN/NiO. Figure 3a shows that the NiO nanoparticles were deposited on
GN sheets upon which Pani nanotubes are deposited, signifying the
successful incorporation of NiO nanoparticles onto GN sheets for a
nanocomposite with Pani nanotubes. A lattice spacing of 0.818 nm can
be attributed to the lattice spacing of the (200) plane of the NiO
nanoparticles in the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite (see the magnified
image of Figure 3a). Figure 3b shows that the
NiO particles are uniformly distributed in the outer shell of the
polymer matrix. In Figure 3c, it can be observed that the short tubes of Pani are precisely
deposited on the GN sheets. We also synthesized Pani using the same
procedure in the absence of the GN and NiO; short tubes of Pani were
obtained, as shown in Figure 3d. In the light of the above observations of TEM analysis,
it can be inferred that the NiO nanoparticles were precisely deposited
on GN sheets and covered by Pani nanotubes. Furthermore, to evaluate
the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the Pani@GN/NiO
nanocomposite were measured. The BET surface area of the Pani@GN/NiO
nanocomposite was found to be 275 m2 g–1 (Figure S1).

nanocomposite, (c) Pani/GN nanocomposite, and (d) Pani.

Optical Studies
The UV–vis
absorption spectra
of Pani@GN/NiO, Pani/NiO, Pani/GN, and Pani are given in Figure 4. In Figure 4a, the band observed at 327
nm for Pani may be attributed to the π–π* electronic
transition of benzenoid rings.24 In the
case of the Pani/GN nanocomposite, the band red-shifted to 332 nm
from 327 nm may be attributed to the interaction of π-electrons
of benzenoid rings with π-bonds of GN, as shown in Figure 4b.25 In Figure 4c, the Pani/NiO nanocomposite illustrates the two bands at 281 and
323 nm, which may be related to the electronic transition from the
valence band to the conduction band in the NiO and due to the π–π*
transition of the benzenoid rings, respectively.26,27 In the case of Pani/NiO, a blue shift is observed in contrast to
that in Pani, which may be attributed to the decrease in the conjugation
of Pani by loading of NiO in Pani, reducing the path of polarons in
Pani. From Figure 4d, it is illustrated that the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite reflected
the two maxima at 276 nm, blue-shifted in comparison with Pani/NiO,
and the other at 375 nm, red-shifted in comparison with Pani from
327 nm, which may be attributed to the increase in the extent of conjugation
of Pani by forming an efficient network by electronic transition from
NiO to GN.28 The significant red shift
in the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite supports the enhanced dc electrical
conductivity because of the ease in the movement of polarons by extended
conjugation in Pani@GN/NiO.

nanocomposite, (c)
Pani/NiO nanocomposite, and (d) Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite.

Raman Spectroscopy
Figure 5 shows the Raman spectra of
Pani@GN/NiO,
Pani/NiO, Pani/GN, and Pani. In Figure 5a, the different modes of vibration are observed. The
sharp peak at 1410 cm–1 may be associated with the
presence of C–N+ polarons.29 The peaks observed at 1330 and 1570 cm–1 may be
due to the presence of GN sheet bands (D and G), and the bands at
1370 and 1592 cm–1 may be due to two-magnon (2M)
and two-phonon (2P) bands of NiO. In Figure 5b, the Raman spectrum of Pani/NiO displays
two vibrational bands at 1363 and 1574 cm–1, which
may be due to the presence of NiO nanoparticles that correspond to
the 2M and 2P models.30−32Figure 5c displays the Raman spectrum of the Pani/GN nanocomposite, showing
the two bands at 1345(D) cm–1 due to disordered
structures in the GN layers and 1576(G) cm–1 due
to sp2 electronic configuration of graphitic carbon phase
in the Pani/GN nanocomposite.33 In the
Raman spectra of Pani, the bands at 1350 and 1565 cm–1 may be attributed to C–N+ and C=C modes
of vibration, respectively, as shown in Figure 5d. Significant shifts of Raman bands of Pani@GN/NiO
are observed in comparison with the Pani/GN and Pani/NiO nanocomposites.
The D and G bands of GN in the Pani/GN nanocomposite are blue-shifted
from 1345 and 1576 to 1330 and 1570 cm–1, respectively,
in the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite, whereas the 2M and 2P bands of NiO
in Pani/NiO are red-shifted from 1363 and 1574 to 1370 and 1592 cm–1, respectively. The substantial band shifts of GN
and nickel oxide constituent in the Pani/GN and Pani/NiO nanocomposites
indicate a strong interaction between NiO and GN sheets, favoring
the charge transfer from NiO to GN sheets28 and forming more holes in Pani. Thus, an increment in the electrical
conductivity of Pani@GN/NiO also strongly supports the interaction
and charge transportation between NiO and GN.

Electrical Conductivity
The initial dc electrical conductivities
of Pani, Pani/NiO, Pani/GN, and Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposites were measured
by a standard four-in-line-probe method, as shown in Figure 6a. The electrical conductivity
of Pani was observed to be 1.832 S/cm. The electrical conductivity
of the Pani/NiO nanocomposite prepared by the method mentioned above
was observed to be 0.853 S/cm, which is slightly less than that of
Pani. It may be proposed that the movement of polarons of Pani get
retarded because of the Coulombic interaction between the polarons
of Pani and lone pairs of oxygen of NiO, as shown in Figure 6b. Although, the d-orbitals
of Ni may increase the number of polarons in the Pani chains by accommodating
electrons from Pani, the Coulombic interaction seems to be a dominating
factor. Shambharkar and Umare23 also reported
that the electrical conductivity of the Pani/NiO nanocomposite decreases
with a low NiO content in the nanocomposite.

Figure 6 (a) Initial dc electrical
conductivities of Pani, Pani/NiO, Pani/GN,
and Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposites and the mechanism of conductivity behavior
of (b) Pani/NiO, (c) Pani/GN, and (d) Pani@GN/NiO.

The initial electrical conductivity at room temperature
of the
as-prepared Pani/GN nanocomposite was observed to be 9.2 S/cm, which
was much higher than that of Pani (1.2 S/cm). It may be proposed that
the charge carriers hop from Pani to GN, where they gain high mobility
along the π-conjugated system of GN, as shown in Figure 6c. The overall mobility of
charge carriers thus enhanced because of unobstructed movement along
the GN nanosheets, leading to an increase in the electrical conductivity
of the Pani/GN nanocomposite. Ansari et al.34 also reported that a sulfonated-Pani/GN nanocomposite exhibited
a high electrical conductivity because of π–π interaction
between sulfonated-Pani and GN.

In the case of Pani@GN/NiO,
the electrical conductivity was observed
to be 11.34 S/cm, which was the highest among all samples. It seems
that the NiO acts as a bridge between Pani and GN, which helps in
the movement of charge carriers from Pani to GN and thus increases
electrical conductivity because of a greater mobility of charge carriers
along the π-conjugated system of GN nanosheets, as shown in Figure 6d. Thus, NiO bridges
additionally facilitate the hopping movement of charge carriers between
Pani and GN in the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposites.

Stability under Isothermal
Ageing Conditions
The isothermal
ageing stabilities of Pani, Pani/NiO, Pani/GN, and Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposites
were calculated, as shown in Figure 7, by using the following equation:13 1  where σt is the electrical conductivity at time t and σ0 is the electrical conductivity
at time zero at experimental
temperature. The as-prepared materials were examined for stability
in terms of dc electrical conductivity retention with respect to time
at different temperatures. The electrical conductivity of each of
the samples was measured at the temperatures 50, 70, 90, 110, and
130 °C versus time at an interval of 5 up to 20 min. From Figure 7a,b, it can be observed
that Pani and Pani/NiO are fairly stable up to 90 °C, whereas
the Pani/GN and Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposites are stable up to 110 °C
in terms dc electrical conductivity, as shown in Figure 7c,d. It may be inferred that
the relative electrical conductivity of Pani@GN/NiO and Pani/GN nanocomposites
showed greater stability than the Pani and Pani/NiO nanocomposite
under isothermal ageing conditions.

Pani, (b) Pani/NiO, (c)
Pani/GN, and (d) Pani@GN/NiO under isothermal ageing conditions.

Stability under Cyclic
Ageing Conditions
The cyclic
ageing stabilities of Pani, Pani/NiO, Pani/GN, and Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposites
were studied, as shown in Figure 8.13 The relative electrical
conductivity (σr) was calculated using the following
equation: 2  where σT is the electrical conductivity (S/cm) at
temperature T (°C) and σ50 is
the electrical conductivity
(S/cm) at 50 °C, that is, at the beginning of each cycle.

Figure 8 Relative electrical
conductivity of (a) Pani, (b) Pani/NiO, (c)
Pani/GN, and (d) Pani@GN/NiO under cyclic ageing conditions.

The electrical conductivity was
recorded for successive cycles
and observed to be increased gradually for each of the cycle with
a regular trend in all of these cases, which may be due to the increment
of the number of charge carriers as polarons or bipolarons at elevated
temperatures. Figure 8a shows the relative electrical conductivity of Pani following the
same trend for each of the cycle with gain in the dc electrical conductivity
as the temperature increases. Also, the relative electrical conductivities
of Pani/NiO, Pani/GN, and Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposites increased as
the temperature increases from 50 to 130 °C, as shown in Figure 8b–d. Among
all of these nanocomposites, the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite showed
the lowest gain in conductivity with less deviation. Thus, it may
be inferred that the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite is a more stable semiconductor
than Pani and among all of these nanocomposites under cyclic ageing
conditions. The difference observed may be attributed to the removal
of moisture, excess HCl, or low-molecular-weight oligomers of aniline.35

Sensing
The dc electrical conductivity
responses of
the sensors based on Pani, Pani/NiO, Pani/GN, and Pani@GN/NiO were
measured on exposure to ammonia (NH3) at room temperature
(∼25 °C). A four-in-line-probe PID-200 (Scientific Equipment,
Roorkee, India) dc electrical conductivity measuring instrument was
used to study ammonia sensing properties. The pellet fabricated was
in contact with the four probes and placed in a closed chamber of
ammonia vapors (Figure 9).

Figure 9 Instrumental setup of the ammonia sensor and the schematic presentation
of the four-in-line probe.

The electrical conductivity immediately decreases on exposure
to
ammonia for 60 s and rapidly reverts back on exposure to ambient air
in next 60 s in all of the as-prepared materials, as shown in Figure 10a. However, the
greatest change in electrical conductivity was observed in the case
of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite. Therefore, the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite
was also tested for different concentrations of ammonia, as shown
in Figure 10b. The
highest change in electrical conductivity was observed for 1703 ppm
of ammonia. As the concentration of ammonia increases from 170 to
1703 ppm, the more polarons of Pani get neutralized by the lone pair
of electrons of ammonia molecules, leading to a decrease of electrical
conductivity. The electrical conductivity change of the Pani@GN/NiO
nanocomposite could be observed on exposure to ammonia as low as 170
ppm concentration.

Figure 10 (a) Effect on the dc electrical conductivity of Pani,
Pani/NiO,
Pani/GN, and Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposites on exposure to (1703 ppm)
ammonia vapors followed by exposure to ambient air with respect to
time, (b) effect on the dc electrical conductivity of the Pani@GN/NiO
nanocomposite on exposure to ammonia vapors at different concentrations,
and (c) steady-state response of dc electrical conductivity of the
Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite on exposure to 1703 ppm ammonia followed
by exposure to ambient air with respect to time.

The steady-state response of Pani@GN/NiO was determined by
first
keeping the sample in 1703 ppm of ammonia environment for 180 s followed
by 120 s in air for a total duration of 300 s (Figure 10c). It can be observed that the electrical
conductivity immediately decreases on exposure to ammonia for about
65 s and attains saturation for further exposures until exposed to
ambient air. The conductivity reverted in ambient air after 180 s
of exposure to ammonia and became saturated at about 240 s.

Reversibility
The sensitivity and reversibility are
the two important parameters for a gas sensor. Sensitivity may be
defined as the time taken to reach the final value after exposure
to vapors and to reach the initial value on exposure to ambient air,
whereas the reversibility may be considered as the cycling between
the analyte and ambient air without any loss in its sensing ability.
The reversibility of Pani and Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite was measured
in terms of the dc electrical conductivity. The reversibility of both
the samples was determined by first keeping the sample in 1703 ppm
ammonia vapors for 30 s followed by 30 s in air for a total duration
of 150 s. Figure 11a represents the reversibility response of Pani in terms of the dc
electrical conductivity with a variation range from 1.849 to 1.812
S/cm in ambient air and on exposure to 1703 ppm of ammonia vapors,
respectively. The change in conductivity observed was 0.037 S/cm,
whereas in the case of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite, the reversibility
was observed with an excellent variation range compared to Pani, which
is from 11.146 to 7.489 S/cm in ambient air and on exposure to 1703
ppm of ammonia vapors, respectively, as shown in Figure 11b. In the case of Pani@GN/NiO,
the observed decrease in conductivity by 3.657 S/cm is indicative
of much higher efficiency than that of Pani in terms of reversibility.
There was around about 99 times greater variation observed in the
conductivity of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite than that of Pani.

Figure 11 Variation
in the electrical conductivity of (a) Pani and (b) Pani@GN/NiO
on alternate exposure to (1703 ppm) ammonia vapors and ambient air.

Sensing under Dry and Wet
Atmospheres
The NH3 response properties under
completely dry and wet atmospheres were
also studied. The effect of relative humidity (RH) on ammonia sensing
properties was studied by mixing of humidity and NH3 vapors.
It was seen that the dc electrical conductivity of the Pani@GN/NiO
nanocomposite sharply decreases and reaches its saturation level within
50 s when exposed to 1700 ppm of dry ammonia prepared by heating of
ammonium chloride and slaked lime mixture. Also, the sample Pani@GN/NiO
was tested for pure water vapors, and it was observed that the decrease
in electrical conductivity was not rapid as that it was in the case
of completely dry ammonia, as shown in Figure 12. To confirm the effect of water vapors
on the ammonia sensing properties of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite,
the sample was also exposed to an NH3 atmosphere at 1703
ppm at different humidity levels viz. 20, 30, 40, and 60% RH. The
electrical conductivity of the sample continuously decreases with
time at different RHs. The variations of humidity levels for the same
concentration keep the conductivity stable. The conductivity variations
of Pani@GN/NiO are not much effected at any RH, and the four curves
were almost similar, from which we may conclude that humidity has
only small effect on NH3 sensing properties.

conductivity response as a function of time of Pani@GN/NiO
nanocomposite exposed to 1700 ppm dry ammonia, 20% (1703 ppm ammonia),
30% (1703 ppm ammonia), 40% (1703 ppm ammonia), 60% (1703 ppm ammonia)
RH, and pure water vapors.

Selectivity
For a worthy and applicative gas sensor,
high selectivity is also an important requirement. The conductivity
responses of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite to ammonia and volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) viz. isopropanol, methanol, ethanol, acetone,
acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde at room temperature (25 °C) are
shown in Figure 13. It was observed that the conductivity response of the Pani@GN/NiO
nanocomposite to 1703 ppm ammonia was 9.8, 6.2, 6.6, 7.9, 6.5, and
6.1 times higher than those for isopropanol, methanol, ethanol, acetone,
acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde, respectively. Such a selectivity results
from the difference of their sensing mechanisms, that is, the neutralization
of polarons of Pani that plays an important role in changing electrical
conductivity on exposure to VOCs. The greater the availability of
lone pairs in a vapor/gas, the greater the observed electrical conductivity
change. Ammonia has more electron-donating nature and thus neutralizes
more number of polarons of Pani. On the other hand, in VOCs, there
are interactions of lone pairs of electrons of oxygen of greater −I
effect than that of nitrogen of Pani. Therefore, the lower electron-donating
tendency of VOCs leads to a lower conductivity change. This also infers
the higher selectivity of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite toward NH3.

Figure 13 Selectivity of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite to 1703 ppm of ammonia
and different VOCs (1 M) in water.

The efficient gas sensing properties of Pani@GN/NiO may be
attributed
to the large surface area of Pani which anchored more adsorption and
desorption of gaseous molecules as well as high polarons mobility
due to the presence of GN, essential requirement for rapid response
of any electrical conductivity-based sensor.13 It is expected that the NiO embedded on GN sheets interacts with
lone pairs of nitrogen atoms of Pani, thus increasing the number of
polarons in Pani and creating a more number of active sites at a large
surface area for the interaction of lone pairs of ammonia molecules
to polarons of Pani. However, the detailed understanding on the role
of NiO and GN sheets in the sensing mechanism of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite
requires further investigations on this aspect.

Proposed Mechanism
for Sensing
Sensing by the Pani@GN/NiO
nanocomposite is based on the decrease in electrical conductivity
on exposure to analyte vapors and to revert on exposure to ambient
air. Therefore, the different aspects of emergence of high electrical
conductivity in the nanocomposite have been discussed above in order
to understand the sensing behaviour of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite.
The sensing mechanism of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite was explained
through dc electrical conductivity response by simple adsorption and
desorption mechanism of ammonia vapors at room temperature, as shown
in Scheme 1. In the
Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite, NiO nanoparticles embedded on GN sheets
interact with lone pairs of nitrogen atoms of Pani; thus, the numbers
of polarons and bipolarons increase in Pani chains. In the presence
of ammonia vapors, the lone pairs of ammonia molecules bind with polarons
of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite, which impedes the mobility of polarons,
leading to a decrease in electrical conductivity. When Pani@GN/NiO
is exposed to ambient air, the ammonia molecules are desorbed from
the surface and thus the electrical conductivity reverts to its initial
value. Thus, the simple adsorption and desorption of ammonia vapors
on the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite govern the mobility of polarons.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism of Interaction of Ammonia with the Pani@GN/NiO
Nanocomposite
However, the humidity
present in atmosphere may also interfere
in ammonia adsorption on the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite, but the conductivity
changes of Pani@GN/NiO are not much affected at any RH so that humidity
has only small effect on NH3 sensing properties. Therefore,
in competition between ammonia and water molecules, it may be said
that the change in conductivity of Pani@GN/NiO may be mainly due to
ammonia vapors because ammonia has more available electrons than water.

The selective response of the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite toward
ammonia may be due to the basic nature of ammonia, which readily interacts
with polarons of Pani, whereas all other VOCs tested are much less
basic than ammonia because they contain an oxygen atom which is more
electronegative than nitrogen, so the electronic interaction with
Pani in these compounds is comparatively poorer.

Conclusions
Pani, Pani/NiO, Pani/GN, and Pani@GN/NiO were successfully prepared
and characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, UV–vis, and XRD analysis.
The Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite showed the higher thermal stability
in terms of dc electrical conductivity retention under isothermal
and cyclic ageing conditions than pristine Pani. The results highlighted
that the Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite was found to be an excellent material
for ammonia sensing with excellent selectivity against VOCs and rapid
response. There was about 99 times greater variation in the electrical
conductivity of Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite than that of Pani during
sensing. The enhancement of sensing properties in the Pani@GN/NiO
nanocomposite may be attributed to the synergistic effect between
NiO, GN, and Pani. Therefore, the sensor based on the nanocomposite
of GN/NiO with Pani may be useful and efficient while the material
is promising for ammonia vapor sensing.

Experimental Section
Materials
Aniline (99%, E. Merck, India) and commercially
available natural graphite powder (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were used to
prepare graphene oxide (GO). Sodium dodecylsulfate, ammonium persulfate
(APS), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrated nickel
nitrate (Ni(NO3)26H2O), sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), and hydrazine hydrate (85%) were obtained from the local suppliers
and used as received.

Preparation of Pani, Pani/NiO, Pani/GN, and
Pani@GN/NiO
Pani nanofibers were prepared through the interfacial
polymerization
reaction in which aniline monomers (10 mmol) were dissolved in hexane
(10 mL) under stirring for 30 min. APS (30 mmol) was gently added
to 10 mL of 1 M sulfuric acid solution under constant stirring. The
solution of APS was added dropwise into aniline solution, and the
mixture was allowed to react for 1 h. The final greenish reaction
product was then filtered, washed with double distilled water, and
then dried in an air oven at 70 °C for 10 h.

In a typical
synthesis procedure of the Pani/NiO nanocomposite, 2 mL of aniline
was dissolved in the solution of 2 mL of 1 M H2SO4 in 90 mL of distilled water. A solution of 0.5 g of nickel oxide
(NiO) was prepared in accordance with the existing literature36 and was then added to aniline solution. APS
(5 g) dissolved in 10 mL of 1 M H2SO4 was added
to the aniline solution, and the reaction mixture was stirred for
24 h at room temperature. The final reaction product was then filtered
and washed thoroughly with distilled water and acetone until the filtrate
became colorless. The resulting product was dried at 70 °C for
10 h.

To prepare the Pani/GN nanocomposite, GO (20 mg) was prepared
in
accordance with the existing literature37 and was then dissolved in 10 mL of 1 M H2SO4 with constant stirring for 1 h. Subsequently, aniline solution (10
mmol) prepared in 1 M H2SO4 was mixed to the
GO solution and stirred for another 1 h. The APS (30 mmol) solution
prepared in 1 M H2SO4 was then added to the
above solution. The final reaction mixture was kept under constant
stirring, followed by a conventional microwave treatment at 300 W
for 30 min. The resulting suspension was separated by centrifugation
and washed with double distilled water and ethanol. The final product
was dried at 70 °C under vacuum for 12 h.

In the synthesis
of GN/NiO, the as-prepared GO (25 mg) was ultrasonically
dispersed in 10 mL of double distilled water for 1 h and 0.5 g of
Ni(NO3)2·6H2O in 25 mL of distilled
water was added into the above dispersion. After constant stirring
for 6 h, 10 mL of 1 M NaOH aqueous solution was added into the above
reaction mixture drop by drop. The pH value was adjusted to ∼10
by 10% aqueous ammonia. After that, 10 mL of hydrazine hydrate (85%)
was added to it. The reaction mixture was stirred for several minutes
before being treated with microwave at 300 W for 30 min. The product
was separated by centrifuging and washed with double distilled water
followed by ethanol. The product was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C
for 24 h. The dried sample was heated in a N2 atmosphere
at 300 °C for 3 h to obtain GN/NiO. The Pani@GN/NiO nanocomposite
was prepared by mixing GN/NiO to aniline monomer in a weight ratio
of 5:1. GN/NiO was dispersed in ethanol and water (1:1 weight ratio)
by stirring for 60 min and then added to the aniline solution prepared
in 1 M H2SO4. An aqueous solution of APS (10
mL) prepared in 1 M H2SO4 was added dropwise
to the mixture of aniline and GN/NiO at 5–10 °C and kept
under constant stirring for 24 h. The resultant product was washed
several times by vacuum filtration using ethanol and double distilled
water. The final product was dried at 50 °C for 12 h.

Characterization
The morphology, structure, and chemical
composition of Pani, Pani/NiO, Pani/GN, and Pani@GN/NiO were investigated
by a variety of methods. XRD pattern were recorded by a Bruker D8
diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at 1.5418 Å. SEM studies
were carried out by JEOL, JSM, 6510-LV (Japan). TEM studies were carried
out by using JEM 2100, JEOL (Japan). The Raman spectra were taken
using a Varian FT-Raman spectrometer. UV–vis spectra were recorded
at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV–vis spectrophotometer
(model 1601). dc electrical conductivity measurements were performed
by using a four-in-line probe electrical conductivity retention measuring
instrument with a PID controlled oven (Scientific Equipment, Roorkee,
India). The thermal stability of all as-prepared materials in terms
of dc electrical conductivity under isothermal and cyclic ageing conditions
was also studied. The equation used in the calculation of dc electrical
conductivity was 3  where I, V, W, and S are the current (A),
voltage (V), thickness of the pellet (cm), and probe spacing (cm),
respectively, and σ is the conductivity (S/cm).11,38 In thee testing of isothermal stability, the pellets were heated
at 50, 70, 90, 110, and 130 °C in an air oven, and the dc electrical
conductivity was measured at particular temperatures at an interval
of 5 min in the accelerated ageing experiments. In the testing of
the stability under cyclic ageing conditions, dc conductivity measurements
were taken five times within the temperature range of 50–130
°C.
