The
objective of pharmaceutical cocrystallization is to create
crystalline analogues that have vastly different properties, such
as solubility, melting point, stability, and bioavailability from
that observed in the pure active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).
Amoxapine is a benzoxazepine derivative and exhibits antidepressant
properties. Amoxapine has very low solubility in water, so it was
cocrystallized with natural acids in a 1:1 ratio in appropriate solvents
by the solvent-drop grinding method. Single crystals of cocrystals
were grown by the solvent evaporation method in water, ethanol, and
methanol. Crystal structures of API salts were determined by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction. Salts were characterized by Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and powder X-ray
diffraction. Solubility of salts was determined in water by the shake-flask
method at 37 °C using UV–vis spectroscopy. Salts of amoxapine
with different acids were successfully developed, and their crystal
structure was determined. Enhanced solubility was found in the salts
of amoxapine for pharmaceutical application in drug formulation.

Introduction
The concept of crystal
engineering1 has
emerged since 1989 as an immense tool in designing novel crystalline
phases of various combinations of different materials to control and
manipulate physical and chemical properties of already existing materials.
The application of crystal engineering ranges from designing multicomponent
crystalline phases of a combination of two or more compounds2 to the formation of large metal–organic
frameworks3 and covalent organic frameworks.4 The idea of formation of different crystalline
phases of various biologically important molecules to enhance their
physical properties has led the researchers across the globe to a
new area of cocrystallization of drugs with other biologically acceptable
molecules.5−8 Cocrystallization and salt formation of various pharmaceutically
important molecules have emerged as an expanding field for contemporary
research.9,10 The FDA proposed that the cocrystals are
“solids that are crystalline materials composed of two or more
molecules in the same crystal lattice”. According to a latest
definition,10 a group of authors considered
the classification of ionic species as cocrystals. Cocrystallization
of antibacterial agents,10 antifungal drugs,11 various antidepressants,12 antitubercular agents,13 and
various others types of drugs14,15 have been reported
to have led to better solubility, dissolution rate, thermal and environmental
stability, and bioavailability. Our recent efforts on cocrystallization
of fluconazole resulted into the generation of new polymorphs of fluconazole
under the influence of different coformers.16 This study indicated that the crystal engineering approach may apparently
fail to generate the targeted cocrystal but eventually result into
a new crystalline phase (polymorph) of the native drug. Our experiments
of cocrystallization of enrofloxacin resulted into seven novel cocrystals
of it with significantly improved solubility and thermal stability.17 In this manuscript, we intend to demonstrate
the scope of cocrystallization of a tricyclic dibenzoxazepine-based
antidepressant, amoxapine (AMX; 2-chloro-11-(piperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]oxazepine), which is widely
used for the treatment of depression.18

Amoxapine became popular in the United States in 1980 as a
rapidly
acting antidepressant compared with other cyclic antidepressants available
in the market at that period of time.19 The N-desmethyl analogue of loxapine, named as
amoxapine20 (Figure 1), had shown neuroleptic action in addition
to antidepressant activity,21 specially
in psychotic depression.22 Various activities
of AMX, like noradrenaline reuptake inhibition,23 5-HT2 receptor antagonism,24 and dopamine D2 receptor antagonism,25 have been studied. AMX blocks the reuptake of the neurotransmitter
norepinephrine, with little effect on serotonin.26 AMX may be an atypical antipsychotic agent because it antagonizes
dopamine D2 receptor.27

Figure 1 Structure of amoxapine
drug molecule.

AMX has poor water solubility
and lower bioavailability.28 These physical
problems of AMX can be solved
by cocrystallization of AMX with organic acids, which are generally
recognized as safe (GRAS) in the list of The Food Safety and Inspection
Service regulations.29 We have selected d-(−)-tartaric acid, fumaric acid, d-(+)-tartaric
acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, malonic acid, l-malic acid, and adipic acid for our experiments.

Results and Discussion
Amoxapine (pKa = 8.83) is likely to
form salts with GRAS organic acids having pKa ranging from 2 to 5, which are not so strong to cause harm
to AMX and the cells. According to the ΔpKa rule of 3,30−32 salt formation occurs at at least three units pKa32 difference, whereas
ΔpKa of <1 means it forms a neutral
cocrystal. ΔpKa in the range 1–3
means this is a gray zone of intermediate proton states. This concept
is also observed in the case of AMX (Table 1). Conspicuously, salt formation is detected
in the case of all acids that are used as coformers. pKa calculations were carried out by a ChemAxon calculator.33

Crystal Structure Description
We have produced nine
novel cocrystals of AMX and characterized them by powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD). Single crystals, suitable for structure determination, could
be grown only for four cocrystals. Single crystals of these four salts
were grown by a slow evaporation method at 4 °C by using different
solvent systems (AMX–fumaric acid crystal in water–methanol
mixture; AMX–maleic acid crystal in water–ethanol mixture;
AMX–succinic acid and AMX–malonic acid single crystals
in an aqueous solution). Crystallographic data and hydrogen bonds
are listed in Tables 2 and 3 for salts of AMX with fumaric acid,
maleic acid, succinic acid, and malonic acid.

AMX/Fumaric Acid Salt (1:1)
The asymmetric unit of
the structure (triclinic system, P1̅ space
group) contained two molecules of AMX+ cation, one monofumarate
anion and a half molecule of fumarate anion, and two molecules of
water (Figure 2a).
AMX+ is connected to fumarate anion by N6–H6A···O7
hydrogen bond and with water molecule via N6–H6B···O10
hydrogen bond (Figure 2a). The carboxylate anions are also hydrogen-bonded to each other
(O4–H4···O8), and the water molecules are hydrogen-bonded
to the carboxylate anions (O7···H10B–O10) (Figure 2a) as well. Water
molecules are also hydrogen-bonded among them (O10–H10A···O9).
Two AMX+ ions are arranged antiparallel in the lattice
and are connected to each other by weak C–H···Cl
hydrogen bond and C–H···π interactions
(Figure 2b). Alternate
layers of acid–water channel and drug molecules are found in
the crystal packing (Figure 2c), where the hydrogen bonds are responsible for the interlayer
connectivity. Acid and water molecules are bonded by strong hydrogen
bonds, whereas AMX+ ions are attached by weak interactions
(C–H···Cl and C–H···π)
in the same layer.

AMX/Maleic Acid Salt (1:1)
One molecule of each of
AMX+ cation and maleic acid anion are present in the asymmetric
unit (monoclinic, space group P21/c) (Figure 3a). AMX+ and maleic acid are linked via N3–H3A···O3
and N3–H3B···O4 hydrogen bonds (Figure 3a). Intramolecular hydrogen
bond is also present in maleic acid O5–H5···O2
(Table 3). In the same
layer of AMX+, cations are arranged parallel to b axis but alternately rotated by 180 °C, as shown
in the Figure 3b, whereas
the cations are connected by weak C–H···Cl (Figure 3c) hydrogen bonds
along c axis. Interlayer interaction of AMX+ (Figure 3c) occurs
by C–H···π and π stacking interactions.
In this crystal packing, AMX+ cations are organized in
parallel so the piperazine ring is present in the same side. They
formed two layers of AMX+, attached by one layer of maleic
acid (Figure 3c).

interaction of AMX along b axis. (c) Interlayer interactions

AMX/Succinic Acid Salt
(1:1)
The asymmetric unit of
this crystal has 4 molecules of AMX+ cation, 2 molecules
of disuccinate anion, and 10 molecules of water (monoclinic, P21/c space group) (Figure 4a). AMX+ and succinate anions are connected via strong hydrogen bonds (N3–H3A···O5,
N6–H6B···O12, N9–H9B···O9,
and N12–H12A···O8). AMX+ and water
molecules are interlinked by N3–H3B···O13, N6–H6A···O14,
N9–H9A···O18, and N12–H12B···O19
hydrogen bonds (Table 3). Two AMX+ molecules are arranged antiparallel in a layer,
and they are interconnected by C–H···π,
C–H···Cl, and C–H···O
interactions (Figure 4b). Layers of AMX+ and succinic acid–water channel
are arranged in an alternate manner in crystal packing because active
pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is arranged antiparallel in the same
layer (Figure 4c).

interaction of AMX molecules. (c) Layers of AMX and succinic acid–water

AMX/Malonic Acid Salt (1:1)
The asymmetric unit is
shown, containing two molecules of AMX+ cation, one molecule
of malonate anion, and three molecules of water (monoclinic, P21/c) (Figure 5a). AMX+ cations are attached to malonate anions by strong hydrogen bonding
(Table 3) of N3–H3A···O4, N3–H3A···O6,
N3–H3B···O3, N6–H6A···O5,
N6–H6A···O6, N6–H6B···O3,
and N6–H6B···O4. Water molecules are also interconnected
by hydrogen bonds (Table 3). AMX+ cations are arranged in a partially parallel
pattern in the same layer and connected by C–H···π
and C–H···O (Figure 5b), forming a chain of molecules. Two layers
of AMX+ are also connected by a different C–H···π
interaction (Figure 5c). Two layers of AMX+ in the lattice are connected by
C–H···O and C–H···π
interactions as they are arranged in parallel, which are further connected
to malonic acid and water molecules present in the channel by strong
hydrogen bonds (Figure 5c).

Powder X-Ray Diffraction
The overlay of calculated
patterns from the single crystal on the experimental powder XRD pattern
confirms the homogeneity and purity of newly formed salts of AMX with
fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, and malonic acid (Figures S30–S33; Supporting Information).
Microcrystalline powder of all salts of AMX were formed by ethanol
by grinding 5–6 times. The powder pattern of AMX, the corresponding
acid, and salts are shown in Figures S1–S9, Supporting Information. Generation of a new salt through solvent-assisted
grinding has been confirmed by the PXRD pattern of the product of
the grinding experiment. The PXRD patterns of all of the salts were
found to be different from those of the starting materials, and also
no peak of the starting material was found as that of the impurity.
The comparison of simulated PXRD pattern of the salt from the corresponding
single crystal data and the experimental PXRD pattern of the same
salt indicated that the hydrated salts (3, 6, and 8) have a different
PXRD pattern compared to that of the crude material, whereas the pattern
of anhydrous salt (5) found by single-crystal X-ray diffraction matched
that of the crude material. The difference in the powder pattern compared
to that of AMX and acid indicated the formation of a novel solid form,
which is supported by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Figures S33–S42, Supporting Information).

IR Spectroscopy
In AMX salts, proton is transferred
from acid to the nitrogen of piperazine ring of AMX. Generally, COOH
group stretching frequency occurs at 1730–1700 cm–1 and COO– group absorbs around 1600 cm–1 (asymmetric). N–H absorption peak for the salt comes at 3400–3100
cm–1 (stretching) and 1610–1550 cm–1 (bending). C–N absorption peak appears at 1350–1000
cm–1 (Table S1 and Figures S20–S29). By this data, it is understood that new salts of the AMX are formed
and proton is transferred to the nitrogen of API.

Thermal Analysis
Amoxapine displayed a sharp endothermic
reaction at 183.1 °C without any phase transformation. Salts
of AMX with d-(−)-tartaric acid, fumaric acid, d-(+)-tartaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, citric acid,
malonic acid, l-malic acid, and adipic acid show melting
points at 147.2, 127.2, 147.1, 183.3, 95.8, 209.5, 162.3, 173.0, and
193.0 °C, respectively. Citrate salt of AMX has shown the highest
melting point of 209.5 °C, and succinate salt of AMX has displayed
the lowest melting point of 95.8 °C. DSC thermograms are given
in Supporting Information, Figures S34–S43, and melting point and melting enthalpies are listed in Table 4.

Solubility
Study
AMX (a biopharmaceutics classification
system class II drug) has poor solubility in water (0.171 mg/mL).34 Hence, it limits the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
parameters of API, which exert effect on the intrinsic dissolution
rate and bioavailability. Enhancement of solubility by help of crystal
engineering of AMX with acids has been observed. A solubility experiment
of AMX and its salts was performed in double-distilled water at 37
°C to determine the aqueous solubility. The solubility of each
salt after 24 h is measured by plotting a calibration curve using
UV–visible spectroscopy (Figures S10–S19). Solubilities of AMX and its salts have been displayed in Table 5. The solubility of
AMX has increased by 4.5–60.4 times for its salts, as shown
in Figure 6. The highest
solubility is observed in l-malic acid salt of AMX (23.5
mg/mL) and lowest in citrate salt of AMX (1.8 mg/mL).

Discussion
We have been successful in growing single crystals of four salts
out of nine and determined their structures. The crystal structures
of these four salts have common features in the packing of ions and
solvents. AMX/fumaric acid salt and AMX/succinic acid salt have an
alternate arrangement of AMX+ layer and acid–water
channel due to the antiparallel arrangement of AMX+ in
the same layer providing binding sites for the respective carboxylate
anion or water molecule to form strong hydrogen bonds. Therefore,
these salts have lower melting points than those of other salts, as
AMX/fumaric acid salt has a melting point 127.2 °C, which is
higher than that of AMX/succinic acid (95.8 °C) because AMX layer
follows more regularity in AMX/fumaric acid salt. They can be differentiated
by melting enthalpies also; AMX/fumaric acid salt has less melting
enthalpy (13.9 J/g) than that of AMX/succinic acid salt (23.4 J/g).
In the case of AMX/maleic acid salt and AMX/malonic acid salt, single
crystals have different patterns; two layers of AMX are present in
between the acid layer in the case of AMX/maleic acid and acid–water
channel in AMX/malonic acid salt. In both cases, the melting point
is higher than that of previous salts (Table 4). The melting point difference between these
two salts may be due to the additional π–π stacking
present in AMX/maleic acid cocrystal along with C–H···π
interaction between two layers of AMX. However, AMX/malonic acid cocrystal
has only C–H···π interaction. Among these
four salts, AMX/maleic acid salt has the lowest solubility, 2.7 mg/mL,
but others have higher solubilities (Table 5). AMX/maleic acid salt is anhydrous, but
the other three are hydrated. This may be attributed to the higher
solubility of these three (AMX/fumaric acid salt, AMX/succinic acid
salt, and AMX/malonic acid salt).

Conclusions
We
have synthesized nine novel salts of amoxapine by a rational
use of the ΔpKa rule of 3. We have
found four single crystals of AMX salt with fumaric acid, maleic acid,
succinic acid, and malonic acid, with solved structures by single-crystal
XRD. In salt structures, the proton of acid is transferred to the
nitrogen of piperazine ring in AMX by ionic N+–H···O– hydrogen bond. A solubility experiment was performed
in double-distilled water at 37 °C for all salts of AMX and pure
API. We have found many-fold increments in solubility, i.e., 4.5-
to 60.4-fold. This introductory study encourages us for further experiment
of soluble salts of amoxapine for antidepressant activity in vivo
and in vitro in future.

Experimental Section
Materials
Amoxapine
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used without further purification. The cocrystal formers were
obtained from various commercial suppliers, such as Adipic acid from
Sigma-Aldrich; d-(−)-tartaric acid from Spectrochem
Pvt. Ltd., India; fumaric acid, maleic acid, and succinic acid from
Sisco Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., India; (+)tartaric acid from
Qualigens Fine Chemicals Pvt. Ltd., India; and citric acid, malonic
acid, and l-malic acid from HIMEDIA Laboratories Pvt. Ltd.,
India. Analytical grade solvents ethanol and methanol were obtained
from Merck, Millipore Corporation.

Solvent-Drop Grinding Method
and Slow Evaporation Method
The salts were synthesized by
the solvent-drop grinding method. An
equimolar mixture of the API and a cocrystal former (one among maleic
acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid, d-(−)-tartaric
acid, (+)-tartaric acid, adipic acid, l-malic acid, and malonic
acid) was made by accurate weighing. Hundred microliters of ethanol
was added to the mixture using a micropipette and was ground in agate
mortar and pestle till free-flowing powder was formed. The same process
was followed about 5–6 times till a new single phase was obtained.
Powder X-ray diffraction data were recorded after a new single phase
was obtained (Figures S1–S9, Supporting
Information). Once a new single phase was formed, the resulting mixture
was used for Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) (Figures S20–S29, Table S1, Supporting Information)
and DSC (Figures S34–S43, Supporting
Information) (Table 4); a portion was dissolved in various solvent systems and kept for
the growth of the single crystal by a slow evaporation process and
was also used for the determination of saturation solubility.

Powder
X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD)
PXRD data were recorded
on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer using parallel beam geometry
equipped with a Cu Kα source, 2.5° primary and secondary
solar slits, a 5° in-plane divergence slit with a 10 mm height
limit of the slit, a sample rotation stage (120 rpm) attachment, and
a DTex Ultra detector. The data were collected over the 2θ range
of 5–50° with a scanning speed of 2°/min, with 0.02°
steps. PXRD patterns are shown in the Figures S1–S9, Supporting Information.

FTIR Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra of APIs and their complexes
were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two FTIR spectrometer in the
range of 400–4000 cm–1. Samples were prepared
using dry KBr in the form of a pellet, and data were processed by
using Spectrum software.35Table S1 lists the FTIR peaks indicating the
salt formation.

Thermal Analysis
The melting points
(Table 4) and thermal
properties of
the complexes were determined by Perkin-Elmer DSC8000. All of the
samples (2–5 mg) were heated at a 5 °C/min heating rate
in sealed aluminum pans. The melting points and the melting enthalpies
of AMX and their salts are reported in the Table 4, and the DSC traces are reported in the
Supporting Information (Figure S34–S43).

Solubility Analysis Using UV–Vis Spectroscopy
The solubility (at 37 °C) of the salts and of the commercially
available API was determined by using UV–vis spectroscopy,
as reported by Karanam et al.,17 by using
the approach established by Higuchi and Connors.36 Initially, the calibration curve was drawn by using solutions
of AMX of known concentrations of AMX and all salts at λmax of 209 nm in water on a Lab India UV3000+ UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Figures S10–S19). These absorbances were plotted against concentration, and a linear
equation is determined for calculating unknown concentrations. Molar
extinction coefficients of AMX and the salts were determined by the
slope of the curve. Concurrently saturated solutions of each of the
AMX and salts were prepared by stirring an excess amount of the compound/salt
in 2 mL of deionized water in 5 mL sealed vials at 37 °C and
stirred at 1500 rpm for 24 h. These solutions were then centrifuged
at 10 000 rpm for 20 min; then, the supernatant solution was
diluted 1000 times using double-distilled water. The absorbance of
the diluted solution was measured at λmax (209 nm)
of the salt, and the concentration of the salt was determined using
the calibration curve. The solubility was calculated by multiplying
the concentration with a dilution factor. Table 5 lists the solubility of AMX and their novel
salts.

Single-Crystal X-Ray Diffraction
Single-crystal X-ray
diffraction data were collected using a Rigaku XtaLABmini X-ray diffractometer
equipped with a Mercury charge-coupled device detector with graphite
monochromatic Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at
100.0 (2) K using ω scans. The data were reduced using CrysAlisPro
1.171.38.46, and the space group determination was done using Olex2.37 The crystal structures were solved by using
ShelXT38 and were refined using ShelXL39 through Olex2 suite. All of the hydrogen atoms
were geometrically fixed and refined using the riding model. Absorption
correction was done by a multiscan method. Data collection, crystal
structure solution, and refinement details for all of the salts are
listed in Table 2.
All of the packing and interaction diagrams have been generated using
Mercury 3.9.40 Crystals of 1:1 salt of
AMX with fumaric acid were obtained from a water/methanol (1:1) mixture
at 4 °C in a refrigerator. Other crystals of AMX with maleic
acid in a 1:1 salt were grown in a 1:1 water: ethanol mixture at 4
°C. Crystals of AMX with succinic acid and malonic acid were
prepared in water at 4 °C. Good quality single crystals were
obtained after 10–15 days.
