The
emergence of
bacterial resistance and hesitance in approving new drugs has bolstered
research on membrane-active agents such as antimicrobial peptides
and their synthetic derivatives as therapeutic alternatives against
bacterial infections. Herein, we document the action of aryl-alkyl-lysines
on liposomes mimicking bacterial membranes using solid-state nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A significant perturbation of the
lipid thickness and order parameter of the lipid membrane was observed
upon treatment with this class of compounds. Encouraged by these results,
the ability of the most active compound (NCK-10) to interact with
aggregates of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) was studied. In vitro experiments
showed that NCK-10 was able to prevent the LPS-induced stimulation
of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α
and interleukin-6. The compound could also disrupt the biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro and bring down the
bacterial burden by more than 99% in a mice model of burn infections
caused by the biofilms of P. aeruginosa.

Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) has been highlighted as an extremely serious challenge facing
world health today. The O’Neill commission has estimated that
by 2050, AMR will claim 10 million lives and cost the global economy
$100 trillion.1 The global scientific community
has been working collectively to solve this problem using various
strategies and several new antibacterial compounds are undergoing
clinical trials.2 In one such strategy,
antimicrobial peptides which work by targeting the bacterial membrane
or modulating the host immune system are being tried for possible
antibacterial agents.3−5 In fact, membrane-active compounds that do not suffer
from inherent problems of antimicrobial peptides such as stability,
toxicity, and expenditure offer more advantages.6,7 Several
of such compounds were designed based on the premise that antimicrobial
peptides partition into the membrane interface rather than adopting
transmembrane alignments.8,9 The important role of
electrostatic forces in the selective interactions of cationic antimicrobial
peptides with negatively charged bacterial membranes has been emphasized
in various designs, which include α-peptides,10 β-peptides,11,12 oligoacyl lysines,13 oligoureas,14 α-AApeptides,15 arylamide foldamers,16 antimicrobial polymers,17−23 cationic amphiphiles,24 β2,2-amino acid derivatives,25 and designs
based on the amino acid conjugates of lipids.26−28 Although almost
all the compounds described above are known to act on the membranes,
few studies have looked into the atomistic details of the perturbation
caused to the membranes.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
is a powerful tool to attain atomistic information on the structure
and dynamics of molecules as well as their interactions. Although
multidimensional solution NMR spectroscopy has been traditionally
used to provide high-resolution structures of globular biomolecules,29,30 solid-state NMR methods have been developed for the structural investigation
of fibrils, supramolecular aggregates, and membrane components.31−35 These techniques have also been developed to investigate the interactions
of membrane-active compounds including antimicrobial peptides with
phospholipid bilayers.36 Therefore, solid-state
NMR spectroscopy offers valuable insights into the macroscopic phase
properties, curvature strain, and fatty acyl chain order of membrane
constituents.37

Aryl-alkyl-lysines
are some of the simplest examples of membrane-active agents. These
small molecules involve easy synthesis and are not substrates for
proteolysis. Interestingly, they have been found to inhibit the growth
of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites.38−43 Their antimicrobial activity could be mostly attributed to their
ability to compromise microbial membranes. In order to investigate
their interactions with bacterial membranes, in this report, we have
used solid-state NMR spectroscopy as a tool. First, solid-state NMR
spectroscopy provided information about the macroscopic behavior of
model membranes made from phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) and phosphatidylglycerol
(POPG) lipid bilayers, in the presence of varying concentrations of
different aryl-alkyl-lysines. Upon identification of the compound
which perturbs the membrane lipids most effectively, we extrapolated
the application of the compounds to other systems, which possess negative
charge and lipid tails, for example, the lipopolysaccharides (LPSs)
of Gram-negative bacteria. We investigated the ability of the best
compound to inhibit the LPS-mediated stimulation of cytokines such
as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).
Further, we also tested the ability of the compound to disrupt the
biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Finally, we have validated the efficacy of the compound in a murine
model of burn infections caused by the biofilms of P. aeruginosa.

Results
The compounds
used in this study consisted of a naphthalene ring, an l-lysine
moiety, and a variable alkyl chain. Depending on the length of the
chain, the compounds (Figure 1) were NCK-4 (butyl chain), NCK-6 (hexyl chain), NCK-8 (octyl
chain), and NCK-10 (decyl chain).

Figure 1 Chemical structures of the compounds used
in the study.

Vesicle Deformation, Inhomogeneity
in Order Parameters, and Membrane Thickness by Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy
To investigate the macroscopic behavior of model POPE/POPG (3:1)
lipid bilayers as a function of compound-to-lipid (C/L) ratio of proton-decoupled 31P, the solid-state NMR spectra for all the four compounds
(NCK-4, NCK-6, NCK-8, and NCK-10) were acquired. The data have been
furnished in Table 1, and the NMR spectra that have been obtained for NCK-10 and are
shown in Figure 2.
In the absence of the compounds and at 310 K, the spectra exhibited
a chemical shift anisotropy around 45 ppm (Figure 2) in agreement with the membranes in the
liquid-crystalline state.44 At 7.1 T, the
phosphorus spectrum is typical of quasi-spheroidal liposomes with
no preferential orientation in the magnetic field: an intense peak
at ca. −15 ppm and a marked left shoulder at +30 ppm. Upon
compound addition at a ratio of 1/50, the 31P solid-state
NMR spectrum represents a spherical shape of the liposomes. In contrast,
at a C/L ratio of 1/20, the shoulder at ca. +30 ppm loses its intensity
and becomes barely detectable, indicative of a prolate distribution
of phospholipid alignments. In addition, the intensities close to
the isotropic chemical shift position become visible. At a C/L ratio
of 1/10, the 31P solid-state NMR spectrum is characterized
by an isotropic resonance, indicating a fast tumbling of smaller lipid
aggregates. Spectral simulation (gray lines) can be performed where
the deformation of vesicles is illustrated by the ratio c/a, which represents the ellipsoid long-to-short
axis ratio (Table 1). The values of c/a close to 1
represent spherical vesicles, which is the case for the lipids POPE/POPG
(3:1) in the absence of the compounds. Upon addition of all the compounds
at a C/L ratio of 1/50, no change in the shape was observed (c/a = 1.1). At a C/L ratio of 1/20, a significant
change was observed only in the case of NCK-10 (c/a = 1.5). However, at a C/L ratio of 1/10, changes
were observed for all compounds, with the c/a values of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 for NCK-4, NCK-6, and NCK-8,
respectively (Table 1). For NCK-10, the damage was such that no c/a value could be determined (c/a = ∞). Thus, it was concluded that NCK-10 was able
to perturb the liposomes most efficiently.

°C.

In order to shed more light on the interactions between
NCK-10 and lipid fatty acyl chains, the 2H solid-state
NMR spectra were recorded with deuterated palmitoyl chains [POPE/POPE-2H31/POPG (2:1:1)] in the presence of increasing
concentrations of NCK-10. As can be seen from the spectra shown in Figure 2B, each of the different
CD2 and CD3 segments contributed a quadrupolar
powder pattern. The characteristic quadrupolar splitting for each
site is defined by the distance between the two main peaks from each
segment.45−47 In a static state, the splitting would amount to
125 kHz; however, motions and cis–trans isomerizations in a
liquid-crystalline bilayer contribute to a reduced value.

This
phenomenon can also be described by the ratio of the measured and
maximal value or the deuterium order parameter SCD. Understandably enough, more freedom is displayed by the
segments in the hydrophobic interior in comparison to the interfacial
region. Consequently, a decrease in the order parameters is noted
with an increasing distance from the carbonyls. The values for the
quadrupolar splittings were obtained from the 2H solid-state
NMR spectra. Subsequently, the order parameters SCD were calculated and plotted against the carbon position
of the labeled lipids (Figure 3). Upon addition of 2 and 10 mol % of NCK-10 (a C/L of 1/50
and 1/10), the 2H solid-state NMR spectra of the quadrupolar
splittings decrease as a function of NCK-10 concentration (Figure 3). This decrease
in the quadrupolar splitting for all positions on the aliphatic chain
(from the glycerol backbone to the center of the bilayer) is associated
with a decrease in the order parameter (SCD), from the so-called plateau region representing the first CH2 segments to the terminal methyl group (Table S1). This change in lipid configuration is related to
a reduction of the hydrophobic chain length of the bilayers from 2
× 24.8 Å to 2 × 21.8 Å for lipids associated with
1/10 NCK-10.

position in the presence of NCK-10 at different C/L ratios.

Ability To Interact with
LPS Aggregates
From the experimental studies described above,
it is clear that NCK-10 perturbs the bacterial membranes. Because
the compound contains two positive charges and one decyl chain, we
reasoned that it might interact with other negatively charged amphipathic
molecules such as LPSs. LPS is a component of Gram-negative bacteria
and forms aggregates in an aqueous solution. These aggregates are
recognized by host cells initiating a cascade of reactions upon recognition,
which ultimately leads to sepsis.48,49 Sepsis, a
global problem, contributes to around 8 million deaths per year.50 Unfortunately, there is no dedicated treatment
for sepsis, and antibiotics, which themselves can trigger sepsis,
remain the drugs of choice for treatment.50 LPSs when released are recognized by the host immune systems and
prompt them to over-react. Uncontrolled inflammation is often a result
of this over-reaction, leading to multiorgan failure or death.4 This uncontrolled inflammation, in turn, is mediated
by an increased production of TNF-α and IL-6 from macrophages/monocytes.4,50 Several antimicrobial peptides and their mimics have been reported
to interact with LPS aggregates and subsequently prevent inflammation
caused by the release of cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6.4,5,51−53 We surmised
that if NCK-10 interacts with LPSs, it would also prevent inflammatory
responses and ultimately sepsis.

At first, we checked the ability
of NCK-10 to interact with a BODIPY dye conjugate of LPSs. In water,
LPSs usually self-assemble to form aggregates, and because of aggregation,
the fluorescence of BODIPY in BODIPY-LPS is quenched. However, dissociation
of the aggregates leads to an increase in the fluorescence of BODIPY.
Such disaggregation is often due to the interaction with an amphiphilic
molecule, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).51,54,55Figure 4A also shows that SDS (2%) was able to increase the
intensity of the fluorescence by several orders of magnitude in comparison
to control measurements (blank). NCK-10, which was amphiphilic as
well, was able to interact with LPS aggregates at concentrations of
10 μg/mL. With an increasing concentration, the response was
enhanced, proving that NCK-10 was able to dissociate the LPS aggregates.

Ability To Prevent the LPS-Induced Stimulation of Proinflammatory
Cytokines TNF-α and IL-6
We surmised that if the compound
can dissociate aggregates of LPS, it can prevent proinflammatory responses
that ultimately lead to sepsis. Thus, we proceeded to check the response
of LPSs on immune cells in the presence and absence of NCK-10. The
experiment was performed with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(hPBMCs), which are known to circulate in blood and produce inflammatory
responses upon interaction with bacterial endotoxins such as LPSs.
Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation was used to isolate hPBMCs from
fresh human blood. Then, the hPBMCs were stimulated with LPS (the
concentration used was 20 ng/mL) in the presence and absence of 10
μg/mL
of NCK-10. The secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α
and IL-6, was quantified using ELISA. As can be seen from Figure 4B,C, NCK-10 on its
own did not elicit any response. However, LPS successfully stimulated
the expression of both TNF-α and IL-6. However, in the presence
of NCK-10, the proinflammatory response of LPS was suppressed. This
experiment proved that NCK-10 could not only treat bacterial infection
but also prevent sepsis.

Ability To Disrupt the Preformed Biofilms
of P. aeruginosa
P. aeruginosa is notorious for forming bacterial
biofilms.56 These biofilms are stable communities
within which bacteria survive with limited resources. Biofilms are
recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment and pose an important problem
for health care.56,57 The biofilm matrix of Pseudomonas sp. has several negatively charged components
such as alginates, LPS, DNA, and so forth.58−61 Outer membrane vesicles also
contribute to the biofilm matrix.62−64 We had earlier seen
that aryl-alkyl-lysines infiltrate the outer membrane of Gram-negative
bacteria.38 In this report, we demonstrated
that NCK-10 also interacts with LPS. On the basis of these observations,
we surmised that NCK-10 would be able to disrupt the biofilm matrix
of P. aeruginosa. NCK-10 was reported
to inhibit various strains of P. aeruginosa at minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 3 to 7 μg/mL.38,39 In order to visualize the effect of the compound on the biofilms
of P. aeruginosa, we treated 72 h old
biofilms (grown on a glass cover slip) of a clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa R590 (described earlier) at a concentration
of 30 μg/mL for 24 h and subsequently stained the biofilm with
SYTO-9. As can be seen from Figure 5A, in the untreated case, the biofilm was thick (12
μm) and uniform, whereas upon treatment with the compound (Figure 5B), only a monolayer
of cells remained (thickness 3.6 μm). Furthermore, the cells
were distributed unevenly. This proved that the compound indeed exhibited
an antibiofilm activity against P. aeruginosa.

Figure 5 Antibiofilm activity of NCK-10 against P. aeruginosa. (A) Untreated biofilms and (B) NCK-10-treated biofilms. (C) In
vivo activity of NCK-10 against burn infections caused by the biofilms
of P. aeruginosa. Bacterial count after
treatment with NCK-10 or colistin in comparison to control. Student’s t-test was used to establish the statistical significance
between the values (p-value <0.05 was considered
to be significant; ***p < 0.001).

Next, we tested if the bacterial cells within the
biofilms of P. aeruginosa were lysed
upon treatment with the compound. When 72 h preformed biofilms of P. aeruginosa were incubated with the compound at
concentrations of 15 and 30 μg/mL for 24 h, a 3.6 logs and 4.8
logs reduction (compared to the control) in bacterial count was observed.

Activity against a Biofilm Model of Burn Infections Caused by P. aeruginosa R590 Inflicted on Mice
In
order to investigate the efficacy of the compound in animal models
of infection, we first created burn wounds in mice and then infected
the wounds with 107 cfu/mL of P. aeruginosa R590. In order to facilitate biofilm formation, the wounds were
not treated for 24 h. After 24 h, the wounds were subsequently treated
for 6 days with NCK-10 at 20 or 40 mg/kg once a day. Colistin was
used as a positive control at a concentration of 30 mg/kg. As can
be seen from Figure 5C, the bacterial burden was reduced by 1.9 logs and 2.3 logs (>99%
reduction) upon treatment with 20 and 40 mg/kg of NCK-10, respectively.
Although colistin was more efficacious, it has to be noted that bacteria
find it easier to develop resistance to colistin in comparison to
NCK-10.39

Discussion
In
the fight against bacterial resistance, membrane-active agents represent
promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Both natural antimicrobial
peptides and their synthetic mimics have entered clinical trials for
treatment against infections caused by microbes.6 Although synthetic membrane-active agents offer more advantages
over natural peptides, more studies need to be performed delineating
their interactions with membranes at an atomistic level. Aryl-alkyl-lysines
and related compounds are microbicidal compounds with activities against
bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses.26,38−43,65 A representative compound, NCK-10,
was found to be a potent compound, which was nontoxic to mammalian
cells at its microbicidal concentrations.38,40,43 In this study, we have documented the interaction
of aryl-alkyl-lysines with lipids simulating bacterial membranes using
solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Additionally, we have probed the ability
of NCK-10 to prevent inflammatory responses caused by interactions
with other negatively charged lipophilic moieties such as LPS. The
compound could also eradicate the biofilms of P. aeruginosa both in vitro and in vivo.

Investigations using 31P and 2H NMR revealed that the interaction with NCK-10
induces supramolecular rearrangements within the vesicles that lead
to deformation (observable in the 7.1 T magnetic field of the NMR
spectrometer). In Figure 6, a schematic of the interactions between NCK-10 and the liposomes,
based on the observations from NMR studies, has been furnished. Furthermore,
upon increasing the NCK-10-to-lipid ratio, isotropic resonance intensities
appeared. This effect was observed by the 31P solid-state
NMR spectroscopy of the phospholipid head groups and the 2H solid-state NMR spectra of the deuterium-labeled fatty acyl chains
(Figure 2A,B), indicating
that the changes in the supramolecular features of the membranes,
rather than local conformational properties, contribute to spectral
alterations. These spectral changes resemble those observed in the
presence of magnetically oriented bicelles,66−69 which with the addition of high
amounts of NCK-10 becomes small enough to tumble freely in all directions
(isotropic bicelles or micelles).8,70 The deuterium
NMR spectra indicate a decrease in the C–2H order
parameter concomitant with the thinning of the membrane in the presence
of NCK-10. This decrease in thickness agrees well with the observations
made when amphiphilic peptides partition into the head group region.71

Figure 6 Schematic model of the partitioning of NCK-10. It is assumed
that the charged and polar functional groups remain in contact with
water, and at the membrane interface, the aliphatic side chains partition
into the hydrophobic region of the membrane. (A) At low concentrations
of membrane-interacting NCK-10, this causes a decrease in the order
parameter of the phospholipid-deuterated fatty acyl chains. (B) In
the presence of high NCK-10 concentrations, membranes of high curvature
are formed, possibly micelles. (C) Liposomes have been shown to deform
in the strong magnetic fields of modern NMR spectrometers. Spherical
liposomes and magnetically deformed structures are shown. From left
to right, the a/c values are 1,
≈1.1, and ≈1.5. D. In comparison, small vesicles or
micelles tumble fast in the magnetic field giving isotropic line shapes.
The sphere was created using the Mathematica program.

Our hypothesis that NCK-10 would be able to interact
with LPS aggregates, which are also negatively charged and contain
lipid tails, is proved in Figure 4. Because of its ability to disassemble the aggregates
of LPSs, we further hypothesized that NCK-10 would prevent LPSs from
invoking a cytokine response. Indeed, the stimulation of TNF-α
and IL-6 production was hindered by the addition of the compound.
This opens up the possibility to use NCK-10 as an antisepsis therapy.

As mentioned earlier, the biofilms formed by P.
aeruginosa are composed of several anionic lipophilic
components and are also recalcitrant to antibiotic therapy. The ability
of NCK-10 to act on P. aeruginosa biofilms
is indeed an important finding. Drugs against any infection caused
by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa are scarce, and therapy against biofilms caused by P. aeruginosa is nonexistent. Therefore, the most
important finding here is that the compound was active in murine models
of burn infections caused by the biofilms of P. aeruginosa. This opens up the possibility of NCK-10 to be used in the therapy
against topical infections caused by P. aeruginosa
biofilms.

Conclusions
In summary, this study
gives a comprehensive understanding of the interactions aryl-alkyl-lysines
have with bacterial membranes. Solid-state NMR spectra prove that
the density, thickness, and order parameters of the lipid bilayer
are significantly perturbed, which ultimately lead to the disordering
and lysis of bacterial membranes. Further, the compound was able to
interact with other medically relevant anionic lipophilic moieties
such as LPS and biofilms of P. aeruginosa, extending its possible use as anti-inflammatory and antibiofilm
formulations. The activity of the compound against P. aeruginosa biofilms in a murine model of burn
infections further opens up its possibility as an anti-infective topical
agent.

Materials and Methods
The synthetic protocols used
for the preparation of the compounds have been described in previous
publications.38 Colistin was bought from
Sigma-Aldrich (Bangalore, India). All lipids were purchased from Avanti
Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). Escherichia coli BODIPY-LPS [BODIPYFL (503/513)] and E. coli 0111:B4 LPS were obtained from Molecular Probes, Life Technologies,
USA. P. aeruginosa strain PA R590 was
acquired from the Department of Neuromicrobiology, National Institute
of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Hosur Road, Bangalore 560029,
India. Culture media were from HiMedia and Sigma-Aldrich (India).
SYTO-9 was bought from Thermo Fischer, Bangalore, India.

Preparation
of Liposomes
Multilamellar vesicles were prepared by co-dissolving
of lipids [POPE/POPG (3:1)
or POPE/POPE-2H31/POPG (2:1:1)] in the absence
and presence of compounds at the aforementioned compound-to-lipid
ratio in a mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Complete mixing
of the components was ensured, and then the solvent was evaporated
using nitrogen gas. The samples were exposed to high vacuum using
a lyophilizer further to remove any traces of solvent and then rehydrated
at h = 0.9 [h = mass of water/the
total mass of the system (phospholipids and water)]. Samples were
made homogeneous by repeatedly vortexing the liposomes for 40 s, freezing
in liquid nitrogen for 30 s, and heating in a water bath at 40 °C
for 10 min. After one to three freeze–thaw–vortex cycles,
the compounds embedded in the liposomes were obtained and transferred
into MAS rotors, which are used as containers for static solid-state
NMR measurements.

Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy
The
solid-state NMR spectra were recorded and analyzed following previously
reported protocols.72,73 A dedicated Bruker AVANCE NMR
spectrometer (7.4 T) was used to run the solid-state NMR experiments.
The proton-decoupled 31P NMR spectra were acquired at 121.5
MHz using a phase-cycled Hahn-echo pulse sequence. The following acquisition
parameters were typically used: a spectral window of 32 kHz and a
π/2 pulse width of 4.30 μs. An interpulse delay of 30
μs and a recycle delay of 2 s were used. A line broadening of
150 Hz was usually applied prior to Fourier transformation. H3PO4 (85% in H2O, 0 ppm) was used as
a standard for the calibration of phosphorus chemical shifts. Samples
were pre-equilibrated (15 min at 40 ± 1 °C) before the NMR
signal was acquired.

2H NMR spectra were recorded
at 46 MHz by means of a quadrupolar echo pulse sequence, with a π/2
pulse width of 3.4 μs and an interpulse delay of 50 μs.
An exponential apodization resulting in 200 Hz line broadening was
applied prior to Fourier transformation starting on the top of the
echo signal. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for at least
15 min at 40 ± 1 °C before the NMR signal was acquired.

Spectral Simulation and Determination of c/a Deformation Ratios
The spectral intensity distribution
upon deformation of vesicles was analyzed using a Fortran program
home written for the purpose. The algorithm first calculates the free
induction decay and then performs its Fourier transformation.73 Parameters such as chemical shift anisotropy
(estimated from the experimental spectrum), line widths, weight (w), isotropic chemical shift, and c/a ratio provided inputs for the calculation using a trial
and error process. Once the simulated spectrum matched with the experimental
one, the only adjustable variable remaining was the ellipsoid c/a ratio. By considering an ellipsoidal
distribution of bilayer orientations, the probability of an alignment
at angle Θ with respect to the magnetic field is74  where Θ is the angle between a directional vector and B0 and c/a represent
the ellipsoid long-to-short axis ratio.69,75,76

Determination
of Experimental Order Parameters
The classical deconvolution
method of Bloom was applied first, followed by spectral simulation
to the refinement of attributions, which allowed a good overlap of
the experimental and calculated spectra. The experimental spectrum
was simulated by entering six to eight measured quadrupolar splittings;
any nonresolved splittings were matched with the best powder pattern
intensities thereafter by varying the signals that represent 16 labeled
positions of the aliphatic chain. The equation linking the NMR-measured
quadrupolar splittings in the lipid bilayers, ΔνQ, to SCD order parameters is45,46  where AQ is the static electric quadrupolar
coupling constant (167 kHz) for methyl and methylene groups. Often,
the plateau is measured where the quadrupolar splittings correspond
to positions k = 2 to 8–10. In addition, the
measurements of the terminal C14-2H3 order parameter report on the dynamics at the center of the bilayer.

Ability To Interact with LPS-BODIPY
Binding and dissociation
of LPSs were performed using a previously published protocol.51 Briefly, a stock solution of 100 μg/mL
of E. coli BODIPY-LPS [BODIPYFL (503/513),
Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, USA] was diluted to 10 μg/mL
in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and sonicated for
2 min every time prior to use. Two milliliters of this sonicated solution
of BODIPY-LPS was transferred to a quartz cuvette at a concentration
of 500 ng/mL. Subsequently, the respective concentrations of NCK-10
in PBS were added to it, and the fluorescence was measured using a
λS55 fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer). The parameters
used were as follows: excitation wavelength: 485 nm; emission wavelengths:
500–700 nm; excitation slit width = 5 nm; emission slit width
= 15 nm; and temperature: 25 °C. Three independent experiments
were performed, and the data furnished are a representative image
of one experiment.

Ability of NCK-10 To Inhibit the LPS-Induced
Stimulation of Proinflammatory Cytokines
This experiment
was performed following a previously published protocol.51 Briefly, hPBMCs were freshly isolated and seeded
in 24-well plates for 3 h [1 × 106 cells in 1 mL of
Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (Gibco)]. To these wells, 20
ng/mL of E. coli 0111:B4 LPS (Molecular
Probes, Life Technologies, USA) was added in the presence or absence
of NCK-10 (10 μg/mL). Hanks’ balanced salt solution and
only NCK-10 were also added as controls. After incubation for 18–24
h, ELISA was performed on the cell culture supernatants for cytokines
TNF-α and IL-6. ELISA kit was bought from BD Biosciences, and
manufacturer’s instructions were followed for the experiment.

Biofilm Disruption Assay
These experiments were performed
using slightly modified versions of previously published protocols.39,40

Confocal Imaging
Sterilized glass cover slips (diameter
13 mm) were positioned in six-well plates. To the wells containing
the cover slips, 2 mL of mid-log phase culture of P.
aeruginosa (R590), at a concentration of 105 CFU/mL in a nutrient broth containing 0.1% NaCl and 0.1% glucose
(complete medium), was added. The plate was incubated at 33 °C
for 72 h under a stationary condition. Then, the medium was aspirated,
and unbound bacteria were carefully removed by washing off the cover
slips with 1× PBS (pH = 7.4). Biofilms containing cover slips
were then placed into another six-well plate, which were supplemented
with 2 mL of complete medium without (untreated control) or with NCK-10
(30 μg/mL). The plates were incubated further at 33 °C
for 24 h. After 24 h, the supernatant was aspirated, and unbound bacterial
cells were removed by washing with PBS. The cover slips were carefully
removed from the wells and placed on the glass slides, stained with
10 μL SYTO-9 (3 μM), and observed under a Zeiss 510 Meta
confocal laser scanning microscope. An LSM 5 Image examiner was used
to prepare the final images.39,40

Ability To
Lyse Bacteria Embedded within the Biofilms40
Biofilms were prepared on sterilized cover slips exactly
as described above. However, instead of imaging, the bacteria embedded
within were counted. Both the NCK-10-treated and -untreated biofilms
(on glass cover slips) were incubated in 100 μL of trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (0.25%) (GIBCO) for 5 min. Then, the surfaces of the cover slips
containing the biofilms were scraped off with a pipette tip. The resulting
cell suspension was then vortexed at a high speed for 1 min to break
up the clumps of bacteria and homogenize the solution. This vortexed
solution was serially diluted, plated on nutrient agar plates, and
incubated for 24 h at 37 °C to obtain bacterial counts. After
24 h of incubation, the plates were counted for bacterial colonies,
and cell viability was expressed as log (CFU/mL) and compared with
the untreated control.40 The experiment
was performed twice.

In Vivo Infection Studies
These
experiments were performed using slightly modified versions of previously
published protocols.39,40 The mice experiments were approved
by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee. Female Balb/c mice (6–8
weeks old) weighing 22–25 g were used for the experiment. At
first, the mice were anesthetized by injecting a ketamine–xylazine
cocktail intraperitoneally. Once anesthetized, around 1 cm2 of their dorsal skin surface was shaved and cleansed. Around 6 mm
burn wounds were created in the shaved area by applying a 120 s heated
brass bar for 10 s.39 Subsequently, the
burn wounds were infected with a mid-log phase bacterial inoculum
of 107 CFU of P. aeruginosa (PA R590) prepared in PBS. The treatment was started 24 h post-infection,
to allow sufficient time for biofilm formation. Burn wounds were treated
every 24 h for 6 days with 40 μL of NCK-10 (at concentrations
of 20 and 40 mg/kg) solution and colistin (30 mg/kg) solution in saline.
Only saline was applied to mice in the untreated control group. Mice
were sacrificed 7 days post-injury; the infected muscle tissue was
excised, weighed, and homogenized in 10 mL of PBS. These homogenized
solutions were serially diluted and then plated on MacConkey agar
(Himedia, India). Bacteria were counted after 24 h, and the results
were analyzed and reported as a log (CFU/g) of tissue.39,40p value was calculated using unpaired Student’s t-test (two-tailed two samples assuming equal variances)
between the control group and the treatment group (a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant).39,40
