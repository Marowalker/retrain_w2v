Titanium
dioxide doped with the Pt ion (Pt–TiO2) was synthesized
by a sol–gel method using only water as the solvent and conducting
dialysis. The photocatalytic activity for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol
(4-CP) on Pt–TiO2 was not affected by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
specific surface area under visible light (VL) irradiation. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure
measurements revealed that only the Pt(IV) ion existed in the TiO2 bulk and both Pt(II) and Pt(IV) were present near the Pt–TiO2 surface. Pt(IV) is most likely substituted in the Ti(IV)
site of the TiO2 lattice because of their similar ionic
sizes. Quantitative analysis of Pt(II) was performed in the XPS measurements,
indicating that the amount of Pt(II) on the surface increased with
an increase in the doping amount from 0.2 to 1.0 atom %. We synthesized
0.5 atom % Pt–TiO2 with various Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratios
by changing the Ti(OC3H7)4 concentration
used in the sol–gel synthesis. The 4-CP conversion on Pt–TiO2 increased linearly with an increase in the Pt(II)/Pt(IV)
ratios. A similar relationship was obtained with Pt–TiO2, which was prepared by a conventional sol–gel method
in ethanol–water mixed solvent. Therefore, the Pt(II)/Pt(IV)
ratio is a key factor affecting the photocatalytic activity of Pt–TiO2 under VL irradiation. Our results indicate that controlling
the mixed valence states of the doped metal ions is a new strategy
to developing highly active metal-ion-doped TiO2 under
VL irradiation.

Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely studied for
photocatalytic degradation of organic environmental pollutants because
it is inexpensive and chemically stable and has strong oxidation power.
Photogenerated holes with oxidative power are formed by exciting electrons
from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, which is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light.1−5 UV irradiation greater than 3.2 eV, which corresponds to the band
gap of TiO2, is only less than 5% in solar light energy.6 Development of a visible light (VL)-responsive
TiO2 photocatalyst has been desired from the viewpoint
of the effective utilization of solar energy for environmental remediation.

Among the various methods to produce VL response, the doping of
metal ions into TiO2 lattice is a simple and effective
method. By doping metal ions, impurity levels form near the bottom
of CB or the top of VB, leading to the narrowing of the TiO2 band gap. For the degradation of organic compounds under VL irradiation,
many researchers have synthesized TiO2 doped with various
metal ions (M-TiO2) by the sol–gel method.7−16 Typical procedures are as follows: titanium alkoxides dissolved
into alcohols are added dropwise to aqueous acidic solution containing
metal ions, and then, the obtained mixture is evaporated, dried, and
sintered. Sol–gel synthesis can be easily conducted without
any special equipment. However, there are many inconsistent results
regarding the optimal doping amount and sintering temperature for
the synthesis of M-TiO2. The optimal synthetic conditions
of Pt–TiO2 were 0.5 atom % doping and sintering
at 400 °C for the degradation of dichloroacetic acid, whereas
the activity for 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) degradation depended little
on the Pt content in the range of 0.5–2.0 atom % and sintering
temperature in the range of 100–400 °C.17 For the degradation of 4-CP on In–TiO2, doping of 7 atom % In(III) sintered at 450 °C showed the highest
activity.12 On Pt–TiO2 and Cr–TiO2 prepared at 0.3 atom % doping and
sintered at 400 °C, the photocatalytic activity significantly
enhanced for photobleaching of methylene blue, the oxidation of iodide,
and the degradation of phenol in aqueous solution.18 With a part of PtO deposited on the TiO2 surface,
0.4 atom % Pt–TiO2 sintered at 400 °C showed
the highest activity for NOx oxidation.19 Such a variety of optimal conditions of M-TiO2 under VL irradiation is ascribed to the difference in the
metal-ion dopants, the preparation conditions, and the chemical reactions
used to estimate the photocatalytic activity. For the development
of highly active VL-responsive M-TiO2, understanding a
key factor affecting the photocatalytic activity is required. Many
studies have reported that the oxidation states of metal-ion dopants,8 the presence of fractional content of the rutile
phase,18 oxygen vacancies,20 crystallinity,21 or Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface area22 influence
the photocatalytic activity of VL-responsive M-TiO2. However,
the most influential factor for the photocatalytic activity of M-TiO2 is not fully understood.

Previously, we have prepared
porous M-TiO2 doped with
seven different metal ions by the sol–gel method using only
water as the solvent and conducting dialysis to purify the obtained
TiO2 sol before drying and reported that Pt–TiO2 sintered at 200 °C showed the highest photocatalytic
activity for the degradation of 4-CP.23,24 Kinetic studies
of the degradation of 4-CP on Pt–TiO2 revealed that
4-CP was degraded to CO2 via the formation of hydroquinone
and benzoquinone as the intermediates.25 During dialysis, protons adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles are gradually removed and then the particles tend
to undergo aggregation with the formation of pores, leading to the
BET specific surface area larger than 200 m2 g–1. Such an aqueous sol–gel method with no addition of alcohol
is more suitable for industrialization.23−27

In this work, we prepared Pt–TiO2 with different
BET specific surface areas or with various ratios of Pt(II)/Pt(IV)
and clarified the relationship between the ratio and the photocatalytic
activity of Pt–TiO2. There are few studies elucidating
the effect of multiple valence states of single metal ions doped in
TiO2. Our results will provide a new strategy to developing
highly active M-TiO2 working under solar light.

Results
and Discussion
Effect of Doping of Pt Ions
Figure 1 shows the time course
of 4-CP conversion
on 0.5 atom % Pt–TiO2, Pt–TiO2 synthesized without dialysis (Pt–TiO2(ND)), and
TiO2 under UV or VL irradiation. The 4-CP conversion is
defined as the concentration of 4-CP degraded divided by the initial
4-CP concentration. Complete degradation of 4-CP, that is, 100% conversion,
was obtained on Pt–TiO2 under UV irradiation for
60 min or under VL irradiation for 120 min. It is worth noting that
the photocatalytic activity of Pt–TiO2 is much higher
than that of TiO2 under UV irradiation, suggesting that
the doped Pt ions hardly act as a recombination center of the photogenerated
holes and electrons. Figure 1 also indicates that the 4-CP conversion is almost the same
on Pt–TiO2 and Pt–TiO2(ND) under
VL irradiation, whereas that on Pt–TiO2 is higher
than that on Pt–TiO2(ND) under UV irradiation. Both
Pt–TiO2 and Pt–TiO2(ND) were anatase
(Figure S1), and the crystallite size was
estimated to be 4.5 or 4.3 nm, respectively, which was evaluated by
the Scherrer equation. As shown in Table 1, the BET specific surface area of Pt–TiO2 is 250 m2 g–1, which is higher
than that of Pt–TiO2(ND) by a factor of 1.5. It
is generally believed that a higher photocatalytic activity is obtained
for the catalysts with a higher specific surface area because the
photocatalytic reaction proceeds on the surface. Thus, the higher
activity of Pt–TiO2 than that of Pt–TiO2(ND) under UV irradiation, as shown in Figure 1, is explainable. However, Figure 1 also indicates that the photocatalytic
activity of Pt–TiO2 is not affected by the BET specific
surface area under VL irradiation. The reason will be discussed later.

UV irradiation.

a Crystallite size was evaluated from
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak of anatase (101).

Figure 2 shows the
effect of Pt doping amount in the range of 0.2–1.0 atom % on
4-CP conversion after VL irradiation for 90 min, indicating that the
photocatalytic activity increases with an increase in the doping amount.
No appreciable change in morphology was observed between TiO2 and Pt–TiO2 (Figure S2). Even for 1.0 atom % Pt–TiO2, no diffraction
peak attributable to the Pt metal or PtO2 was detected
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Figure 3).28 Thus, the
doped Pt ions are present homogenously inside or between TiO2 lattices. Figure 4 shows the diffuse
reflectance spectra of TiO2 and 0.2–1.0 atom % Pt–TiO2, indicating an enhancement of absorption in the visible light
region by Pt doping. From the Tauc plots shown in the inset of Figure 4, the band-gap energy
of TiO2 was evaluated to be 3.08 eV. With an increase in
the doping amount, the band-gap energy of Pt–TiO2 decreases from 2.98 to 2.82 eV (Table 1), indicating that the higher photocatalytic
activity observed at a higher doping amount is attributable to an
increase in the VL absorption ability.

Valence States of the Doped
Pt Ions
Figure 5 shows the X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of 0.5 atom % Pt–TiO2, and its deconvoluted bands indicate the presence of Pt(II) and
Pt(IV) states on the surface. The Pt LIII edge X-ray absorption
near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of 0.2–1.0 atom % Pt–TiO2 and 0.5 atom % Pt–TiO2(ND) are presented
in Figure 6 with the
reference spectra of PtCl2 and PtO2. The sharp
absorption band at the Pt LIII edge, which is called white
line, corresponds to the electron transition from 2p3/2 to 5d5/2.29 In general, when
the oxidation state of Pt is lower, the density of the unoccupied
d states is lower, resulting in the decrease in the white line intensity.30 The Pt ion exists as Pt(IV) in the bulk because
the XANES spectra of all Pt–TiO2 samples resembled
the spectrum of PtO2. Choi et al. have reported that a
metal ion having an ionic radius similar to that of Ti(IV) (0.745
Å) is doped by being substituted in the Ti(IV) site, whereas
a larger metal ion is most likely located in the interstitial positions
of the TiO2 lattice.18 The ionic
radii of Pt(II) and Pt(IV) are 0.94 and 0.765 Å, respectively,31 and thus Pt(II) is significantly larger than
Ti(IV). This is coincident with our findings that Pt(II) was detected
only by XPS, which mainly reflects the chemical environment on the
surface, and no Pt(II) was detected by XANES, which can provide information
on the bulk. Kim et al. have reported that Pt(II) and Pt(IV) in Pt–TiO2 synthesized in the ethanol–water mixed solvent by
the sol–gel method act as trap sites of the photogenerated
holes and electrons, respectively, resulting in the suppression of
their recombination.17 As described above,
because the photocatalytic activity of Pt–TiO2 was
not affected by the BET specific surface area in spite of the surface
reaction, we attempted to quantify Pt(II) on the surface of Pt–TiO2.

Quantitative Analysis of
Pt(II) near the Surface of TiO2
The PtCl2 powders were mixed with TiO2 at various ratios in an
agate mortar and ground thoroughly
for 10 min using a pestle for the XPS measurement. Figure 7 shows a linear relationship
between moles of Pt(II) (4.21 × 10–7 –
1.68 × 10–6 mol) and the peak area due to Pt(II)
after the deconvolution of the XPS spectra. The details of the measurement
method are provided in the Supporting Information. Using this linearity, the moles of Pt(II) in 0.2–1.0 atom
% Pt–TiO2 were estimated from the XPS spectra. As
listed in Table 2,
the moles of Pt(II) increased from 0.68 × 10–7 mol in 0.2 atom % Pt–TiO2 to 10.65 × 10–7 mol in 1.0 atom % Pt–TiO2. These
values indicate that the Pt(II) ion near the surface is only 3.88–12.1%
(the details of the calculation are described in the Supporting Information) of the total Pt amounts in 0.2–1.0
atom % Pt–TiO2. Table 2 also lists the ratios of the peak area of
Pt(II) to that of Pt(IV) (Pt(II)/Pt(IV)), which were calculated by
deconvoluted bands in the XPS spectra, suggesting that the Pt(II)/Pt(IV)
ratios increase with an increase in the doping amounts and are almost
the same for 0.5 atom % Pt–TiO2 and Pt–TiO2(ND), whose photocatalytic activities are almost the same,
as shown in Figure 1. Higher photocatalytic activity was obtained on Pt–TiO2 with a higher doping amount, as mentioned above. Therefore,
it is expected that the photocatalytic activity as well as the Pt(II)/Pt(IV)
ratios increases by increasing the doping amount more than 1.0 atom
%. However, an increase in the Pt doping amounts is found to be expensive
and thus we tried
to find a way to increase the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio of 0.5 atom % Pt–TiO2 by changing the synthetic conditions.

Effect of Pt(II)/Pt(IV)
on Photocatalytic Activity
We have found that the Pt(II)/Pt(IV)
ratio in 0.5 atom % Pt–TiO2 can be controlled by
changing the volume of Ti(OC3H7)4 titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) used
for TiO2 synthesis (Table 3). Figure 8 shows that Pt(II) estimated from the XPS spectra of 0.5 atom
% Pt–TiO2 increases from 1.08 × 10–7 to 1.46 × 10–6 mol by adding 0.75–20
mL of TTIP to 180 mL of aqueous HNO3 solution using the
sol–gel method. Concerning the formation of Pt(II), it is likely
that some H2PtCl6 are reduced by C3H7OH, which is produced via the hydrolysis of TTIP. An
increase in the TTIP volume used in the synthesis results in a high
concentration of C3H7OH, leading to acceleration
of the reduction of Pt(IV) to Pt(II). The Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio was
estimated from the peak area of the deconvoluted bands in the XPS
spectra, and its dependence on the moles of TTIP is plotted in Figure 8, indicating a similar
dependence on the amounts of Pt(II) determined quantitatively.

a Crystallite size was evaluated from
the XRD peak of anatase (101).

The photocatalytic degradation of 4-CP was performed on 0.5 atom
% Pt–TiO2 with various Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratios. Figure 9 indicates that the
4-CP conversion increases linearly with an increase in the Pt(II)/Pt(IV)
ratio regardless of the VL irradiation times of 30, 60, and 90 min.
This finding suggests that the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio is an important
factor affecting the photocatalytic activity of Pt–TiO2.

Figure 9 Effect of the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio of Pt–TiO2 (solid
triangle) and Pt–TiO2(ref) (open circle) on the
4-CP conversion after VL irradiation for 30, 60, and 90 min.

To examine the validity of this
finding, Pt–TiO2(ref) was synthesized by conducting
hydrolysis of TTIP in HNO3 aqueous solution containing
ethanol. In our method using
only water as the solvent, white precipitates (Ti(OH)4)
are formed and stirring vigorously for a few days is necessary to
disperse them into a homogenous sol. For saving time, many research
groups have synthesized metal-ion-doped TiO2 in an aqueous
solution containing ethanol and metal-ion precursors. Previously,
we compared the photocatalytic activity of Pt–TiO2 to that of Pt–TiO2(ref) that was prepared by the
standard method reported by Kim et al.17 and reported that the photocatalytic activity of our Pt–TiO2 was much higher than that of Pt–TiO2(ref)
under both UV and VL irradiation.25 However,
in this study, we observed that the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratios in 0.5 atom
% Pt–TiO2 and Pt–TiO2(ref) were
14.0 and 10.3, respectively. The Pt–TiO2(ref) powders
with Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratios of 4.2, 9.7, 10.3, and 13.8 were prepared
by changing the TTIP concentration. As shown in Figure 9 with open circles, the 4-CP conversion on
Pt–TiO2(ref) increases linearly with an increase
in the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio and is nearly equal to that on Pt–TiO2 when being compared at the same Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio. Figure 10 indicates that
the 4-CP conversion on Pt–TiO2 increases linearly
with an increase in the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio under UV irradiation for
15 or 30 min. Therefore, regardless of the synthetic method and the
light source, similar linearity was obtained between the 4-CP conversion
and the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio, indicating that the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio
is a key factor affecting the photocatalytic activity of Pt–TiO2.

Figure 10 Effect of the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio of Pt–TiO2 on
the 4-CP conversion after UV irradiation for 15 and 30 min.

On the basis of the above results,
a schematic representation of
the reaction mechanism of Pt–TiO2 is shown in Scheme 1. The XPS and XANES
measurements revealed that Pt(II) and Pt(IV) existed near the TiO2 surface and only Pt(IV) existed in the TiO2 bulk.
It is likely that the photogenerated electrons are trapped at Pt(IV)
in the bulk and the photogenerated holes can escape from the recombination
with the photogenerated electrons and reach the Pt(II) site on the
surface, where 4-CP is oxidized. Because Pt(IV) is present from the
surface to the bulk, the trapped electrons migrate by hopping toward
the surface and react with oxygen. Spatial separation of photogenerated
carriers through the coexistence of Pt(II) and Pt(IV) and the presence
of more Pt(II) near the surface might be the reason why the Pt(II)/Pt(IV)
ratio affects the photocatalytic activity under VL irradiation. At
a higher Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio on the surface, the distribution of Pt(II)
is more biased and more photogenerated holes can exist near the surface
for the degradation of 4-CP. We have examined the effect of illumination
on the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio of Pt–TiO2. After the
photocatalytic degradation of 4-CP on 0.5 atom % Pt–TiO2 (Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio = 14.0) was performed for 150 min, where
100% of 4-CP was degraded, and for 450 min, the Pt–TiO2 powders were collected by filtration and then dried. No significant
change in their XPS spectra was observed (Figure S6), and Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratios were evaluated to be 13.5 and
14.1, respectively. This finding indicates that the ratio of Pt(II)/Pt(IV)
remains almost constant after being used for the photocatalytic experiments.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism of Separation of Photogenerated Carriers by Pt(II)
and Pt(IV), Which Act as Hole and Electron Traps, Respectively
The photocatalytic activity
under VL irradiation was not dependent
on the BET specific surface area, whereas under UV irradiation, Pt–TiO2 (specific surface area: 250 m2 g–1) exhibited a higher activity than that of Pt–TiO2(ND) (167 m2 g–1). Such a difference
might be due to the number of photogenerated holes and electrons.
Under VL irradiation whose energy is less than the band-gap energy,
electrons are excited
from the VB of TiO2 to the energy levels below the CB,
which are formed by the doped Pt ion. The flat band potentials of
Pt–TiO2(ref) were shifted positively by 50 mV, indicating
that the CB edge position in Pt–TiO2 is slightly
lowered.17 Therefore, the charge separation
of absorbed photons to electrons and holes occurs near the doped Pt
ion. On the other hand, under UV irradiation, electrons are excited
to the CB on all of the illuminated surfaces of TiO2. That
is, more holes and electrons are generated on the Pt–TiO2 surface under UV irradiation, suggesting that the surface
reaction with the adsorbed 4-CP is a rate-determining step. The presence
of more 4-CP adsorbed on Pt–TiO2 with a larger specific
surface area can enhance the degradation rate of 4-CP. On the other
hand, under VL irradiation, the migration of photogenerated holes
and electrons to the Pt–TiO2 surface is a rate-determining
step and thus the amounts of 4-CP adsorbed on the Pt–TiO2 surface do not affect the degradation rate.

Conclusions
Visible-light-responsive Pt–TiO2 photocatalysts
with the BET specific surface area larger than 200 m2 g–1 were prepared by conducting dialysis using the sol–gel
method. In Pt–TiO2, Pt(II) and Pt(IV) existed near
the TiO2 surface and only Pt(IV) existed in the TiO2 bulk. The amount of Pt(II) as well as the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio
in 0.5 atom % Pt–TiO2 increased by changing the
TTIP concentration in aqueous HNO3 solution during sol–gel
synthesis. We can conclude that the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio is an important
factor determining the photocatalytic activity of Pt–TiO2 under VL irradiation. It is often deduced that the presence
of different valence states of a single metal ion would enhance the
photocatalytic activity by suppressing the recombination of the photogenerated
electrons and holes. We demonstrated for the first time that the photocatalytic
activity increased linearly with the ratio of Pt(II)/Pt(IV) in Pt–TiO2 by developing the characterization method for estimating
the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio as well as the synthetic method to prepare
Pt–TiO2 having various Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratios. This
finding was also demonstrated for Pt–TiO2 prepared
by the conventional sol–gel method, suggesting that many inconsistent
results, which have been reported to date for optimal synthetic conditions
of Pt–TiO2, might be systematically understood by
examining the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio of Pt–TiO2 used
for their experiments. Many VL-responsive TiO2 photocatalysts
doped with various metal ions have been developed from the viewpoint
of effective utilization of solar energy. Our results indicate that
controlling the mixed valence states of metal dopants in TiO2 is a new strategy to developing highly active photocatalysts under
solar light.

Experimental Section
Preparation of Pt–TiO2
TTIP (95%,
0.955 g cm–3, 0.75–20.0 mL) was added dropwise
to 180 mL of aqueous solutions containing 1.3 mL of HNO3. Unless otherwise noted, the TTIP amount of 15 mL is the standard
condition. The obtained mixture was peptized at room temperature for
6 days to form a highly dispersed colloidal solution. This TiO2 sol was then dialyzed in a molecularly porous dialysis tube
(molecular weight cutoff: 3500) for 2 days until pH 3 was obtained.
An aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (content of Pt was 0.2–1.0 atom % against Ti + Pt) was added
to the TiO2 sol, followed by dialysis for another 1 day.
The obtained sol was dried in an oven (ESPEC, ST-120) at 40 °C
for 3 days, and the resulting xerogel was ground into fine powders
using an agate mortar and pestle. The powders were sintered by ramping
at 3 °C min–1 and keeping at 200 °C for
2 h. The concentration of Pt ions, which came out of the TiO2 sol into water during the dialysis, was determined by inductively
coupled plasma spectroscopy (Varian, ICP-AES Liberty Series II and
Agilent technologies, 5110 ICP-OES) and was used for the calculation
of the Pt ion content in Pt–TiO2. Pure TiO2 without Pt ions and Pt–TiO2(ND) were also synthesized.

For comparison, Pt–TiO2 powders were prepared
by modifying the literature method.17 An
ethanol solution (25 mL) containing TTIP (1.25–20 mL) was added
dropwise to 250 mL of H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solutions containing 0.6 mL of HNO3 (pH 1.5),
in which the amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O was varied to keep the Pt content to be 0.5 atom %. The obtained
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 days and then evaporated
at 50 °C using a rotary evaporator. The obtained powder was ground
into fine powders using an agate mortar and pestle and then sintered
at 200 °C for 2 h after being heated at the raising rate of 3
°C min–1.

Characterization of Pt–TiO2
XRD (Rigaku,
miniflex 600) analysis was performed with Cu Kα radiation (40
kV, 15 mA) at 2θ angles from 10 to 90° with a scan speed
of 10° min–1. The BET specific surface area
was measured with nitrogen as the adsorptive gas by an automatic surface
area analyzer (Shimadzu, Trister II 3020). Diffuse reflectance UV–vis
absorption spectra of the powder samples were obtained using a spectrophotometer
(JASCO, V-670). The valence state of the Pt ion near the TiO2 surface was analyzed by XPS (Thermo Scientific, K-Alpha). The Pt–TiO2 powder was placed in a Clear Disk (JASCO, CD-05) and pressed
into a pellet of 5 mm in diameter using a hand press. The binding
energies were calibrated with reference to the C 1s peak (284.8 eV)
originating from the surface impurity carbons. The valence state of
Pt ion in the TiO2 bulk was analyzed by XANES. The XANES
spectra for the Pt LIII edge were recorded on beamline
11 at Kyusyu Synchrotron Light Research Center. As reference samples,
PtCl2 and PtO2 powders were used. Each powder
was mixed with boron nitride in an agate mortar for 10 min and then
molded into a pellet of 7 mm in diameter using the hand press. The
XANES spectra of this pellet placed in a polyethylene bag were measured
in the transmission mode. The synthesized Pt–TiO2 powder sample was placed in the polyethylene bag, and the XANES
spectrum was measured in fluorescence mode using a Lytle detector.

Photocatalytic Degradation of 4-CP
The synthesized
Pt–TiO2 (0.2 g) was suspended in 100 mL of 1.0 ×
10–4 mol dm–3 4-CP solution in
a transparent Pyrex bottle, which was immersed in a water bath at
30 °C. Under air purging, the suspension was kept in the dark
for 30 min to reach the adsorption–desorption equilibrium and
then irradiated by a 150 W halogen lamp for 150 min. The light intensity
through a long pass filter (Edmund, cut-on wavelength: 400 nm) was
measured by a solar power meter (Sato Shouji Inc., SPM-SD) at the
center of the Pyrex bottle to be 26 mW cm–2. For
comparison, photocatalytic experiments were performed using four 4
W black lights as the UV light source. The light intensity was measured
to be 3.5 mW cm–2 by a radiometer (Iuchi, UVR-400,
S-365). An aliquot sample (7 mL) was withdrawn from the suspension
at appropriate times and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant
liquid was filtrated through a 0.20 μm filter and then analyzed
by a high-performance liquid chromatograph (Shimadzu) equipped with
a UV detector (detection wavelength: 280 nm) and a C18 column (Shim-pack,
VP-ODS 4.6 mm × 25 cm). The eluent was a mixture of water with
methanol (1:1 by volume; flow rate: 1.0 mL min–1).
