Bioapatite is probably
the key factor in the unreplicated success of vertebrates. Chemical
data on bioapatite composition can be achieved on a solid sample by
using different analytical tools such as spectroscopic and spectrometric
methods. As analytical outputs can be affected by the physical–chemical
characteristics of the sample matrix, an internal standard is usually
required to correct and validate the results. Bioapatite lattice can
accommodate iso- and heterovalent substitutions during life or diagenesis
varying its chemical composition through (geological) time. If on
the one hand, this makes bioapatite a unique archive of physical and
chemical information for both the living cycle and the events occurring
after death, on the other, it excludes the identification of a sole
internal standard. Here, we propose a method to measure major element
concentration with specific care for P, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Si, Al, and
Fe, which are the main substituent atoms in bioapatite, through homemade
matrix-matched external calibration standards for laser ablation inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). We tested the method
on living and fossil shark teeth, critically comparing the results
obtained using other analytical techniques and certified external
standards. We demonstrated that matrix-matched calibration in LA-ICPMS
is mandatory for obtaining a reliable chemical characterization even
if factors such as matrix aggregation variability, diverse presence
of volatile compounds, the fossilization footprint, and the instrumental
variability can represent further variability parameters.

Introduction
Bioapatite played a
fundamental role in the evolution of life as
it has triggered the unreplicated success of living and fossil vertebrates.
In addition, bioapatite represents in fossil organisms a unique archive
of physical and chemical environmental information. Chemical data
are in this case achieved with a wide range of analytical tools targeted
to evaluate not only elemental composition itself but also highlight
crystal-chemical evidence. Such techniques include scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), mass spectrometry, X-ray (micro)diffraction, Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy, electron microprobe (EMP) analysis, and Raman
analysis.1−4 Among them, electron microprobe (EMP) and laser ablation inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) represent powerful analytical
tools that are also potentially able to provide the spatial distribution
of major (EMP) and trace (LA-ICPMS) elements in several types of solid
matrices. However, as for LA-ICPMS, the absolute amount of materials
removed by laser can vary due to differences in the physical–chemical
features of the sample matrix and to the related absorption behavior
of the used laser wavelength, thus, strongly affecting the accuracy
and precision of the resulting data.5,6 Therefore,
an internal standard is generally in use to adjust variations in the
quantity of material ablated during each run. Likewise, the chemical
composition determined by comparing the characteristic X-ray intensities
obtained from the sample and standard in EMP measurements must be
corrected for the matrix effect. Although EMP is generally considered
the more appropriate method to gain major element concentration, it
is also strictly dependent on the calibrating standards (usually minerals).
Moreover, EMP is, undoubtedly, more expensive and less diffused than
other instruments.

In fossil and living organisms with calcium
carbonate matrix, calcium
is unequivocally adopted as internal standard according to the nearly
constant stoichiometry of CaCO3 (i.e., lack of relevant
iso- and heterovalent substitutions of Ca2+). On the other
hand, when dealing with organisms with a phosphate matrix (i.e., bioapatite),
it is not a trivial matter to adopt a unique internal standard. In
fact, hydroxyapatite (HA), which is the main form of bioapatite in
living and fossil organisms, may accommodate chemical substitutions
(typically with carbonate ions) both in the phosphatic (A-type substitutions)
and hydroxylic (B-type substitutions) sites of its structure.7−11 During life, substitutions are limited but once isolated from living
tissues, the HA lattice can potentially accommodate iso- and heterovalent
substitutions at all sites during or after burial by diagenesis in
consequence of the combination of physical and chemical alteration
processes. In this way, the chemical composition of HA can vary over
geological time.12−17 Moreover, long-term preservation of bioapatite can involve recrystallization
and alteration processes and drive to enrichment in other elements
[e.g., rare-earth element (REE), Si, Fe, Mg, and Mn].16,18,19

For biological matrices,
such as invertebrate shells or vertebrate
teeth and bones, either living or fossil, several approaches to major
element quantification have been proposed,20 and a large number among them appeals to National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Materials (SRM) as single
and/or multiple point calibrators. More specifically, NIST SRM 610
(and/or NIST SRM 612) trace elements in glass, NIST SRM 1400 bone
ash, and NIST SRM 1486 bone meal (below labeled as NIST 610, NIST
612, SRM 1400, and SRM 1486, respectively) are the most used certified
standards in measurements of phosphate matrix.21,22 However, when an exclusive (i.e., not affected by isomorphic substitutions)
internal standard is missing, the matrix-matching constrain remains
dramatically unsolved. In fact, while SRM 1400 and SRM 1486 are both
bone-based materials, they differ in their organic content [0.87 and
31.5 wt % by mass loss on ignition (LOI), respectively],21,22 which can affect ablation rates. Likewise, the drawback of NIST
glasses is that the matrix of NIST 610 and NIST 612 is mainly SiO2, so fundamentally different from the HA matrix, resulting
in significant analytical biases.

In the literature, possible
solutions that do not require the use
of the internal standard are mentioned. Guillong et al. proposed to
normalize the concentration of all elements as oxides to 100 wt %
after external calibration against reference glasses.23 Following a similar approach, Liu et al. described an internal
standard-independent calibration strategy for LA-ICPMS analysis of
anhydrous minerals and glasses based not only on the normalization
of the sum of all metal oxides to 100 wt % but also introducing a
matrix correction factor that considers the concentration and the
net count rates of an analyte measured in the sample and in the reference
material for calibration.24

Our research
is aimed to explore similar paths, by comparing results
obtained using different calibration standards as external calibrators
in a multianalytical approach. We tested diverse calibration strategies
for quantifying major elements in fossil and living bioapatite shark
teeth using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), LA-ICPMS, and inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), the latter on acid-digested
samples. We prepared a series of in-home HA matrix-matched standards
(HMMS) and used them as external calibrating curve for LA-ICPMS and
XRF to measure concentration of major elements (P, Ca, Mg, Na, K,
Si, Ti, Al, Fe, and Mn) reported as oxides wt % in bioapatite. Later,
SRM 1400 and SRM 1486 were used as single-point calibrator to calculate
the concentration of the same elements. Results were thus critically
compared. Our definitive goal is to develop a reliable method or find
conclusions for chemical characterization by LA-ICPMS of small-sized
samples (i.e., 50–500 μm, not measurable by XRF and ICP-OES)
avoiding the use of EMP, which also deserves some constrains.

As reported above, two structural Ca sites allow various type of
cationic substitutions into the lattice, while anionic substitutions
occur at the OH (F, Cl, CO3) and PO4 (CO3) sites. Bioapatites are commonly represented by HA (i.e.,
dahllite structure); however, carbonate- and fluoro-substituted hydroxyapatites
(i.e., francolite structure) are quite common, thanks to carbonate-
and fluoride-enriched mechanisms (up to 1% in weight) occurring during
in vivo mineralization.7,25−27 Herein, we
will focus on cationic substitutions, and therefore fluorine, carbonate,
and other possible substitutions with volatile elements are not dealt
in the discussion but only considered as contributing to the loss
on ignition (LOI), which will be measured through thermal methods.

Materials
and Methods
Samples
Teeth of the widespread Paleogene mega toothed
shark Otodus sp. and living Charcharias
taurus Rafinesque, 1810 (Figure 1) were selected for our study. Even if shark
teeth, like those of other cartilaginous fish, are mostly composed
of fluorapatite rather than hydroxyapatite, we selected such samples
as they are widespread in time and space and, therefore, largely investigated.
Moreover, as mentioned above, the composition of the anionic site
is not relevant to the aims of our investigations.

Figure 1 Shark teeth analyzed
in this paper: living C. taurus (left)
and Paleogene Otodus sp. (right).

Teeth were longitudinally cut using a high-precision wire
saw (model
AGB9001, from Agar Scientific) equipped with a diamond-coated cutting
wire. Two separate portions were produced from each tooth. After drying
at 30 °C for 24 h, one piece was incorporated in resin (Figure S1, Supporting Information) and later
used for LA-ICPMS measurements. The remaining half was further transversally
cut to isolate the dentin and enameloid fractions of the teeth, which,
after drying, were separately ground to a fine powder. Resulting materials
were finally processed for XRF and ICP-OES analyses, the latter after
acid digestion.

Intruments
ICP-MS X series II from
Thermo Fisher Scientific
equipped with the 213 nm laser ablation device UP-213 from New Wave
Research was employed for the sample and standard characterization.
Prior to optimizing laser ablation for the bioapatite matrix, the
instrument was tuned using the NIST 610 and NIST 612 glasses measuring
at instrument-optimized working conditions the intensity of the signals
from U and Th (U/Th vs U). We fixed to measure abundance ratios between
two glasses to gain a double check on bulk measurement accuracy. The
laser ablation device employs a single long-working distance lens
to focus the beam on the sample surface with the possibility to modulate
the geometry of the ablation (from a single spot to lines with size
varying from 4 to 100 μm). Standards and samples were mounted
to expose their surface to the focal plane of the laser.

Before
sample- and matrix-matched standard measurements, the following experimental
parameters need to be optimized: (i) laser intensity (%), i.e., the
percentage of the laser beam that reaches the sample surface, can
be modulated by changing the geometry of the reflective ends where
initial beam is directed; (ii) laser frequency (Hz), i.e., the time
when the laser output pulse power remains continuously above half
its maximum value; (iii) laser fluence (J/cm2), i.e., the
energy delivered per unit area; it depends not only on laser features
but also on sample chemical and physical properties, therefore this
parameter could not be preset, but is measured during ablation; (iv)
ablation line width (μm), i.e., the width of the ablation line
that can be set varying the slits opening; (v) duration(s) and scan-speed,
i.e., the time of persistence of the laser ablation on the ablating
surface; (vi) purging gas flow (argon, mL/min), i.e., the volume of
gas used to transport the ablated sample to plasma (we kept this parameter
constant at 500 mL/min). A preablation, that is an ablation at mild
conditions producing a fluency about approximately equal to 1/10 compared
to the operating conditions, was always applied to clean up the surface.
The approach to reach the optimized ablation conditions on standards
and samples will be further discussed.

XRF data were collected
using a wavelength dispersive Philips PW
1480 X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer (Philips, Almelo, The Netherlands)
using the methods of Franzini et al. for determination of elemental
concentration.28 With this method, the
fluorescence intensity Ij of the element j in a sample containing N elements is
related to the mass absorption coefficients of the sample by the formula  where Cj and N are the concentrations of the elements and the number
of elements in the sample, respectively, and Kj,i is absorption coefficient.
Loss on ignition (LOI) values for samples were obtained from thermogravimetric
measurements (see below).

Inductively coupled plasma optical
emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES,
PerkinElmer Optima 4200 DV) was employed to check element concentration
in acid-digested samples after calibration with certified standard
solutions.

Thermogravimetry coupled with evolved gas mass spectrometry
was
employed to find the weight percentage of volatile compounds. Measurements
were carried out with a Seiko SSC 5200 thermal analyzer equipped with
a quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESS, GeneSys Quadstar 422), which
allowed the analysis of gas produced during thermal reactions. Gas
sampling by the spectrometer was via an inert, fused silicon capillary
system, heated to prevent gas condensing. Gas analyses were carried
out to determine the nature of the released chemical species with
temperature. Background subtraction was used to obtain the point zero
conditions before starting the evolved gas analysis. Experimental
conditions were: heating rate 20 °C/min; heating range 25–1100
°C; purging gas ultrapure helium at a flow rate of 100 μL/min.
Mass analyses were carried out in multiple ion detection modes measuring
the m/z ratios 18 for H2O, 30 for NO, and 44 for CO2, where m/z is the dimensionless ratio between the mass number
and the charge of an ion (these gasses were selected to better define
the real contribution to the LOI of organic matter rather than the
substituting volatile compounds); SEM detector at 900 V was employed
with 0.5 s of integration time on each measured mass.

HMMS Preparation
The concentrations of each element
in the highest and lowest standard were chosen to bracket as better
as possible ranges reported in selected literature papers.15,29 Operatively, a stock solution with defined Na and K concentration
was prepared using pure grade analytical reagents (NaNO3 and KNO3, respectively) and Millipore water. Later, appropriate
aliquots of the stock solution were separately added to four mixtures
formed by proper amounts of ultrapure micronized HA (Sigma-Aldrich)
and the oxides MgO, SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, and MnO2 (analytical
grade reagents, Sigma-Aldrich). To prevent apatite dissolution, immediately
after the addition of the solution, the pH of each aliquot was adjusted
to 7.5 ± 0.1 using few drops of ammonia diluted solution. Each
suspension was mixed and homogenized in an agate mortar and then dried
at 30 °C for 12 h; the resulting powders were then rehomogenized
in the agate mortar. Afterward, 750 mg of each powder was pressed
for 1 min under 6 t pressure into 12 mm diameter tablets.30 These “standard tablets”, each
at a different elemental concentration (Table 1), were used to calibrate the LA-ICPMS following
the analytical procedure discussed in Nardelli et al. and better detailed
in the following.31 Likewise, 300 mg of
each powder was employed to calibrate XRF following an approach like
those reported in Castellini et al.32

LA-ICPMS Calibration
Our first goal was to optimize
the ablation conditions, as the amount of material removed by the
laser beam in standards and samples strongly reflects their physical–chemical
properties (hardness, massiveness, density, etc.). We initially applied
mild ablation conditions setting laser intensity at 40%, with a frequency
of 5 Hz and tracing 55 μm width ablation lines for a duration
of 240 s. Such laser setting was applied to HMMS and produced fluence
values close to those reported by Willmes et al. for bioapatite matrix
samples.13 We have chosen applying ablation
lines instead of single spot ablations as the latter can be affected
by laser-induced elemental fractioning. This side effect may occur
when a large number of shots is carried out in close sequence as a
consequence of the thermal effects taking place in the vicinity of
the ablation crater and of the increasing degree of elemental fractioning
occurring when ablating for a long time and, therefore, from ever
deeper cavities.

The mass spectrometer was then preliminarily
calibrated with HMMS at the above-reported ablation conditions and,
later, tablet prepared with SRM 1400, SRM 1486, and with pure HA (12
mm diameter, 750 mg weight, 6 t pressed) were analyzed as unknown
samples. Ablation conditions were then modulated and optimized (Table S1, Supporting Information) as long as
the concentrations measured for Ca and P in SRM standards and HA returned
values close to those certified or stoichiometric (Figure 2). These ablation conditions
were then applied to HMMS, SRM standards, and shark teeth. Precision
and accuracy were within ±1%. Ti and Mn detected by LA-ICPMS
were always below 0.01 wt % and this result was also confirmed by
XRF and ICP-OES. As regards Mn in SRM standards, this limit also agrees
with the concentrations (not certified) reported in the data sheets
(17 and 1 μg/g for SRM 1400 and 1486, respectively), whereas
Ti concentrations are not reported. However, as Ti and Mn do not play
a relevant role in isomorphic substitutions in bioapatite, we did
not experiment with other methods to better refine their concentrations
that will be not reported and further commented in the Results and Discussion section.

calibration parameters as highlighted
by the measured concentration of Ca and P (filled circles, reported
as oxide weight %) in SRM 1400 and SRM 1486. Assigned values (SRM
data sheets) are indicated by solid lines along with the associated
expanded uncertainty (dashed lines).

Results and Discussion
Table 2 reports
the measurements on teeth obtained with the different analytical methods.
The chemical formulae were calculated assuming ideal stoichiometry
and normalized on the basis of 16 (A + T)-site cations,33 according to the general apatite formula A10(TO4)6X2, where A stands
for Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Fe3+, and Al3+, whereas the tetrahedral T-site
is occupied by P5+, Si4+, Al3+. The
normalization must satisfy the equation  where k is a numerical
constant.
The anionic X site is occupied by OH–, F–, Cl–, CO32–, O2–, but it is not necessary to know its chemistry for
our aims as it does not influence the normalization of the cationic
sites. Likewise, REE, C, and S were not determined and are not considered
in the chemical formulae as their absence does not affect the significance
of the comparisons among the different techniques. The same normalization
procedure applies also to Table 3, which will be discussed later.

a The integrated signals from samples
are the same from Table 2 (same ablation lines). AL: ablation line; D.: dentin; E.: enameloid.

The numerical results are in
good agreement with those described
in literature for living and/or fossil organisms.14,15,29 In general, and without considering differences
arising from each analytical method, Table 2 shows that the P2O5 content ranges from 26.01 to 35.01 wt %. The minimal and maximal
P2O5 concentrations were recorded in porous
dentin and enameloid of living shark, respectively. Similar considerations
also apply to CaO (35.27 wt % in living shark dentin and 49.49 wt
% in fossil shark enameloid). In fossil teeth, SiO2 can
be primarily ascribed to fossilization (i.e., isomorphic substitutions
and, more likely, to inclusions of terrigenous materials, as evidenced
by the simultaneous increase of Al2O3 well evident
in enameloid and dentin of Otodus sp., but absent
in C. taurus, Figure 3). On the other hand, Na and Mg may have
been incorporated into the bioapatite lattice also during living cycle.
As already evidenced by Nemliher et al.,14 it is not possible to discriminate which cations are, actually,
of biogenic origin or which have been integrated during ageing/fossilization,
although it is reasonable that Al and Si are incorporated only in
very small quantities (a few parts per million) during life-cycle,
as evidenced by measurements obtained on C. taurus.

Figure 3 Correlation between SiO2 and Al2O3 concentrations (oxide weight percent, Table 2) in enameloid (filled symbols) and dentin
(open symbols) for fossil Otodus sp. obtained through
LA-ICPMS (circles; average values), XRF (triangles), and ICP-OES (squares)
and, as better evident in the magnification, for living C. taurus measured with LA-ICPMS (stars; average
values) and ICP-OES (diamonds).

It is crucial to highlight that percentage data obtained with LA-ICPMS
(Table 2a) strongly
differ from those obtained with XRF (Table 2b) and ICP-OES (Table 2c); in particular, sums of percentage concentrations
measured through LA-ICPMS on all of the samples are clearly lower
than those measured through XRF and ICP-OES. Likewise, atoms per formula
unit obtained by applying the method above detailed, do not show a
unique trend. Before commenting on these differences, it is opportune
to check how concentration values change after calibrating with SRM
1400 and SRM 1486 (single-point calibration). More in detail, SRM
1400 (bone ash) and SRM 1486 (bone meal) were used to measure major
element concentrations in fossil and recent teeth, respectively. This
procedure did not require the ablation of new areas on the sample
surface, as the intensity signals produced by previous ablations and
used for quantification with HMMS standards were reelaborated using
the signals from SRM standards. In this way, differences in concentration
can neither be ascribed to instrumental biases as all of the signals
are taken in the same working session, nor to compositional variations
of samples. Moreover, it should be stressed that ablation conditions
applied to SRM have been optimized through HMMS and, therefore, it
would not be possible to set such values a priori using exclusively
the one-point calibration method.

Results are reported in Table 3 and, basically, parallel
to those illustrated in Table 2 even if with minor
discrimination between enameloid and dentin values. Significantly,
major elements Ca and P analyzed in living shark teeth (Table 3a) show close percentage concentrations
for dentin and enameloid, and are in general lower than those detected
for dentin and enameloid in fossil teeth (Table 3b).

Data reported in Table 2a (XRF) and Table 2b (ICP-OES) are in good agreement.
In fact, using acid digestion
and dilution both for sample and standards (ICP-OES) and matrix-matched
solid standards (XRF), the matrix constrain is nearly irrelevant.
In fact, at these conditions, ICP-OES and XRF are almost exclusively
affected by interelement interference issues (i.e., the effects related
to radiation interferences, optical or X-rays, respectively), but
not by the overall matrix and the physical properties of the sample.
Likewise, variation in intensity signals and, therefore, in concentration
values arising from the different abundance of volatile compounds
in the sample in ICP-OES and XRF are solved as well. In fact, volatile
molecules are removed during acid digestion (ICP-OES); otherwise,
their contribution, when the total amount is known, can be easily
accounted during data elaboration (XRF).

On the other hand,
volatile compounds can play a predominant role
in affecting concentration values when they are dispersed in the aerosol
produced by laser ablation. Actually, as clearly shown by the thermogravimetric
curves and mass spectrometry of the gases evolved during heating (Figures S2–S5, Supporting Information),
the difference in concentration in both enameloid and dentin of living
shark teeth is high (overall weight loss 15.8 and 34.6 wt %, Figures S2a and S3a, respectively), whereas it
is significantly lower in fossil samples (6.80 and 7.57 wt %, Figures S4a and S5a). In dentin and enameloid
of living shark, the major thermal events occurred between 200 and
500 °C and are mainly related to the thermal decomposition of
the organic fraction as evidenced by the intense exothermic reactions
(differential thermal analysis curves, Figures S2a and S3a) and by the release of H2O, NO, and
CO2 (Figures S2b and S3b). In
contrast, in fossil teeth, in the same thermal range, the weight loss
is strongly limited and a clear signal related to the release of CO2 was observed only in dentin (Figure S5b). Furthermore, in fossil enameloid and dentin, two reactions occurring
between 700 and 800 °C producing the release of CO2 are well evident (Figures S4b and S5b). First, forming a shoulder between 720 and 750 °C in enameloid
and a peak with maximum at about 730 °C in dentin, is from the
decarbonatation of B-type substitutions in bioapatite frames;34 second, higher temperature (maxima at 805 and
792 °C in enameloid and dentin, respectively) can be related
to decarbonation of calcium carbonate present in terrigenous materials
as mentioned when discussing chemical data. These reactions, which
are less evident in C. taurus, further
prove that the complexity of the matrix sometimes depends also on
the coexistence of elements with different chemical speciation (i.e.,
Ca in bioapatite and in carbonate). Moreover, differences in the temperature
values at which a thermal event occurs indicate that energy bond varies.
This behavior can be related not only to fossilization (fossilized
tooth is fully mineralized, i.e., the organic matrix had nearly decomposed
over time) but also to anionic substitutions in the bioapatite frame.
The discussion of the other reactions related to thermal decomposition
of apatite is beyond the aim of this work; nevertheless, they well
match with those reported in literature.34,35

The presence of volatile compounds in the ablated aerosol
and differences
in matrix physical properties can result in mass response variations.
However, the specific pattern of apparent enrichment and depletion
of the various elements that characterize the matrix effect signature
probably mirrors a composite interplay between composition and size
distribution of ablated particles and their decomposition and ionization
mechanisms in the plasma. In fact, it is demonstrated that the LA-ICPMS
may also cause elemental fractionation due to the dependence of vaporization,
ionization, and ion transmission on the composition and size distribution
of the particles in the laser-generated aerosol.36 Larger particles or particles that consist of a highly
refractory matrix need longer residence time within the ICP or higher
gas temperatures for complete vaporization.37 Of course, such constrains do not apply to other techniques.

Proper comparisons among the different analytical techniques were
required to better evaluate the significances of the obtained results
and the analytical goodness of the proposed method. Measurements carried
out on dentin of Otodus sp. showed a clear agreement
among the three analytical techniques; this portion of the tooth should
contain a higher amount of C in the tetrahedral site as highlighted
by the lowest presence of P, fully confirmed by the three methodologies.
On the other hand, Ca and P atoms per formula unit from enameloid
are in good agreement when calculated through LA-ICPMS and ICP-OES
measurements, but are slightly different with respect to those from
XRF (Figure 4 and Table S2, Supporting Information). However, according
to Lübke et al.,29 Ca/P molar ratio
of teeth of fossil sharks should be higher in dentin than that in
enameloid, and this behavior was confirmed by all our results (Figure 5).

Figure 4 Correlation between P
and Ca atoms per formula unit in enameloid
(filled symbols) and dentin (open symbols) for fossil Otodus sp. obtained through LA-ICPMS (circles; average values; after calibrating
with HMMS), XRF (triangles), ICP-OES (squares), and LA-ICPMS (horizontal
ellipses; average values; after calibrating with SRM standards) and
for living C. taurus obtained through
LA-ICPMS (stars; average values; after calibrating with HMMS), XRF
(hexagons), ICP-OES (diamonds), and LA-ICPMS (vertical ellipses; average
values; after calibrating with SRM standards).

Figure 5 Correlation
between Ca/P ratios in dentin and enameloid in Otodus sp. (filled symbols) and C. taurus (open symbols) obtained through LA-ICPMS (circles; average values;
after calibrating with HMMS), XRF (triangles), ICP-OES (squares),
and LA-ICPMS (diamonds; average values; after calibrating with SRM
standards).

Measurements performed on living C. taurus teeth are more variable. The most significant
differences arise,
both for enameloid and dentin, from LA-ICPMS that revealed Ca and
P atoms per formula unit significantly different with respect to those
calculated through XRF and ICP-OES measurements (Table S2); the dissimilarity was confirmed by Ca/P molar ratio
as well. According to Lübke et al.,29 Ca/P molar ratio of teeth from recent sharks should be higher in
enameloid than that in dentin, contrary to fossil sharks. LA-ICPMS
results showed (Figure 5) a Ca/P molar ratio in good agreement with the cited literature,
both by average values and by single measurements, confirming the
effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Average values of Ca/P
molar ratios obtained by SRM 1400 and SRM 1486 international standards
also agree with literature,29 although
differences between enameloid and dentin resulted less sharp (Table S2); nevertheless, single measurements
on teeth of living shark are sometimes significantly different from
the average values, highlighting possible constrain in their chemical
characterization.

Conclusions
This study has demonstrated
that matrix-matched calibration in
LA-ICPMS is a significant and effective condition, mandatory for obtaining
a reliable chemical analysis of bioapatite. Uncertainties still concern
some aspects: (i) matrix aggregation variability in different parts
of the same sample; (ii) greater or lesser presence of volatile compounds
(not only organic but also anions such as fluorine, chlorine, and
hydroxyls that form possible isomorphic substitutions); (iii) fossilization
footprint; (iv) instrumental variability.

The ultimate goal
in LA-ICPMS detection is to create an aerosol
to be transformed into a mass spectrum fully representing the composition
of the ablated material. This cannot be fulfilled in many practical
applications because of the variability of the different processes
that occur during the generation of the aerosol. Elemental fractionation
due to preferential vaporization during the ablation can change the
composition in the aerosol formed during ablation and also before
the next laser shot occurs.37 Likewise,
vaporization and ionization of aerosols showing different particle
size distributions inside the ICP ion source may further change the
relative response of the elements when different materials are sampled.

When matrix-matched calibration standards are available, the processes
occurring during LA mainly affect the sensitivity of the method in
general. As changes in the ablation rates, particle size distributions,
and composition of the aerosol should be identical for the calibration
standards and the unknown samples, the major limiting factors should
be removed through calibration but only if the physical properties
of the sample are homogeneously distributed. It is, of course, mandatory
that quantitative data acquisition is carried out at identical ablation
conditions, i.e., during the same ablation session.
