Neural stem cells (NSCs) play an
important role in neural tissue
engineering because of their capacity of self-renewal and differentiation
to multiple cell lineages. The in vitro conventional neurosphere culture
protocol has some limitations such as limited nutrition and oxygen
penetration and distribution causing the heterogeneity of cells inside,
inaccessibility of internal cells, and inhomogeneous cellular morphology
and properties. As a result, cultivation as a monolayer is a better
way to study NSCs and obtain a homogeneous cell population. The cadherins
are a classical family of homophilic cell adhesion molecules mediating
cell-cell adhesion. Here, we used a recombinant human E-cadherin mouse
IgG Fc chimera protein that self-assembles on a hydrophobic polystyrene
surface via hydrophobic interaction to obtain an E-cadherin-coated
culture plate (ECP). The rat fetal NSCs were cultured on the ECP and
routine tissue culture plate (TCP) from passage 2 to passage 5. NSCs
on TCP formed uniform floating neurospheres and grew up over time,
while cells on the ECP adhered on the bottom of the plate and exhibited
individual cells with scattering morphology, forming intercellular
connections between cells. The cell proliferation and differentiation
behaviors that were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay (CCK-8),
immunofluorescence staining, and real-time quantitative polymerase
chain reaction showed NSCs could maintain the capacity for self-renewal
and ability to differentiate into neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes
after the long-term in vitro cell culture and passaging. Therefore,
our study indicated that hE-cad-Fc could provide a homogeneous environment
for individual cells in monolayer conditions to maintain the capacity
of self-renewal and differentiation by mimicking the cell–cell
interaction.

1 Introduction
Neural
stem cells (NSCs) have the capacity for self-renewal and
can generate multiple cell lineages including neurons, astrocytes,
and oligodendrocytes, accounting for the growth of the developing
brain and the regenerative potential of the adult brain in vivo.1−3 The in vitro isolation, expansion, and differentiation of NSCs play
an important role in understanding the biological properties of stem
cells and provide promising solutions for stem-cell-mediated regenerative
medicine, such as treatments for neurodegenerative diseases and spinal
cord injury.4,5

Cultivation as free-floating
aggregates, known as neurospheres,
is a classical approach for expanding NSCs, which is considered to
be a more natural environment for the cells because of the three-dimensional
niche-like structure.6 Many protocols for
culturing NSCs in vitro adopted the method of neurospheres.7−9 However, this method also has some significant limitations. First,
the tightly packed neurosphere interiors limit nutrition and oxygen
penetration and distribution, which will affect the accuracy of some
studies such as proliferation assays and studies of the effects of
growth factors and other reagents on cell survival, growth, and differentiation.10 Second, the cells inside the neurospheres cannot
be visualized, making it hard to determine their morphology and compare
the cell-specific properties.11 In addition,
the culture method brings some technical difficulties such as loading
uniform numbers of spheres with uniform size into individual wells
for high-throughput screening and performing uniform differentiation.12

To solve these problems, culturing NSCs
as a monolayer has been
investigated to precisely control the in vitro milieu of each cell
and obtain a rather homogeneous undifferentiated cell population,
which is suitable for studying the properties of cells at the individual
cell level. The most common way to perform the monolayer culture is
by coating the culture substrates with peptides derived from the extracellular
matrix (ECM) such as laminin, fibronectin, and Matrigel, and other
substances such as poly-l-ornithine and poly-l-lysine.13−15 D’Aiuto et al. used monolayer cultures of human-iPSC-derived
NSCs on Matrigel-coated plates to obtain large-scale generation of
neurons, which was ideal for high-throughput screening.12 Xiao et al. also used plates coated with Matrigel
for the expansion of NSCs.14 Ray and Gage
cultured NSCs from mice and rats on PORN-laminin-coated plastic plates
to investigate and compare the cell-specific properties, where the
monolayer culture contributed to accurately evaluate cell shape, morphology,
and other characteristics.11 Blaschke et
al. grew primary rat NSCs as monolayers on polydimechylsiloxane-based
gels coated with l-poly-ornithine to study the effects of
elastic substrates on NSC functions.16 Similarly,
Vay et al. applied l-poly-ornithine and bovine fibronectin
to precoat culture dishes to obtain homogeneous and undifferentiated
NSCs for further characterization.17 Compared
with our study, these attempts to culture NSCs in monolayer conditions
relied on signals mediated by cell-substrate contacts with the local
ECM. Though these signals could expand NSC cultures and promote neuronal
differentiation, they are different from the cell–cell contacts
that the cell received in the niche in vivo and in neurospheres in
vitro, which are generally provided by cell adhesion molecules between
cells such as the cadherin family.

Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin),
which is a member of the cadherin
superfamily, a group of cell surface glycoproteins that mediate calcium-dependent
cellular adhesion and communications, has been identified as a key
factor in cell–cell adhesion by means of β-catenin to
participate in signal transduction pathways.18,19 Studies have revealed that cadherin-based substrates such as E-cadherin
and N-cadherin could maintain stem cell features.20,21 Embryonic stem (ES) cells were cultured on plates coated with a fusion protein of human E-cadherin
and IgG Fc domain (hE-cad-Fc), showing that the cells retained the
pluripotency and differentiation features of ES cells.22 The hE-cad-Fc protein was also proved to promote
the survival ability and the paracrine function of the human umbilical
cord blood-derived stem cell and enhance the adhesion and proliferation
of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).23,24 E-cadherin has been certified to be expressed by NSCs and regulate
NSC self-renewal both in vivo and in vitro.25,26 However, few studies were about E-cadherin in the monolayer culture
of NSCs. Therefore, our study first investigated the long-term effect
of the hE-cad-Fc fusion protein on the self-renewal and differentiation
capacities of NSCs via a monolayer culture method, which provided
a promising way for a homogeneous cell population harvest and precise
cell study.

In this study, we applied the human E-cadherin mouse
IgG Fc chimera
protein (hE-cad-Fc) on the polystyrene (PS) surface to obtain the
E-cadherin-coated culture plate (ECP) for the NSC monolayer attachment
by mimicking the cell–cell interaction. The properties of the
ECP were identified through an optical contact angle meter and by
atomic force microscopy (AFM). Primary rat fetal NSCs isolated from
the fetal brain cortex of Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were first
expanded on the tissue culture plate (TCP) as neurospheres and then
cultured on both the TCP and ECP to compare the cell growth and spontaneous
differentiation. Both cell cultures were maintained through five passages
and characterized by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). To identify the maintenance of self-renewal
ability on the ECP, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) was used to detect
the cell growth and proliferation of each generation of NSCs cultured
on the ECP. Additionally, NSCs of passage 5 (P5) obtained from the
ECP were cultured both on the TCP and ECP again and observed by immunofluorescence
to identify the stemness for a long-term culture.

2 Materials and Methods
All experiments involving animals
were performed in accordance
with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the
Chinese Ministry of Public Health and U.S. National Institutes of
Health.

2.1 Preparation of ECPs
The recombinant
human E-cadherin mouse IgG Fc chimera protein (hE-cad-Fc) solution
with a concentration of 439.5 μg/mL was kindly provided by SOMAR
Corporation (Japan), with a purity of over 82% by SDS-PAGE and was
then diluted with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 900
μM of calcium to obtain concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10,
15, 20, 25, 30, and 40 μg/mL. ECPs were prepared as described
previously.23 Briefly, the diluted hE-cad-Fc
solution was added to nontreated PS plates (Iwaki, Japan). The volume
of solution was 3 mL for a 3 cm-diameter culture plate and 100 μL
for one well of a 48-well plate. The plates were shaken by hands until
the solutions covered the bottom of the plates, and then the plates
were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Prior to use, the hE-cad-Fc
solution was aspirated and discarded, and the plates were rinsed with
PBS with 900 μM of calcium (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the study design
and the behavior of
NSCs on the hE-cad-Fc-modified surface.

After air-drying for 24 h at room temperature, the water contact
angle of the modified surface was analyzed by an optical contact angle
meter. The topography of the modified surface was characterized by
AFM (Bruker Dimension ICON, Billerica, MA). The scan area was 4 μm
× 4 μm, and the scan rate was 1.00 Hz.

2.2 NSC Isolation and Culture
NSCs were
isolated from Sprague–Dawley rats at gestational day E12 according
to a previous protocol.27,28 Briefly, embryonic
rat cerebral cortices were separated, dissected, cut into small pieces,
and then transferred into cold PBS and digested with 2.5% EDTA/trypsin
at 37 °C for 5 min. The dissociated cells were collected by centrifugation
and resuspended in a serum-free medium containing neurobasal medium,
2% B27 supplement, 1% glutamine, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor
(EGF), 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
(Gibco, USA). The cerebral cortical NSCs, taken as passage 0 (P0),
were purified and cultured in a 6-well culture plate (Corning, USA)
and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2. When the cells began forming neurospheres, the
original culture medium was replaced with a complete culture medium
containing DMEM-F12, 2% B27 supplement, 1% N2 supplement, 20 ng/mL
EGF, 20 ng/mL bFGF, and 1% PS. After 5 days, the proliferating cells
formed huge neurospheres and then the adherent cells on the bottom
were discarded. When the neurospheres were large with the center in
dark under optical microscopy indicating the cells in the center were
not growing well, or some neurospheres began to adhere on the bottom
of culture plate, they needed to be passaged immediately. Normally,
the NSCs were passaged every 2–3 days. The neurospheres were
collected, dissociated to individual cells by mechanical digestion,
and cultured in a new T75 culture flask in the fresh complete culture
medium. The individual cells grew into new neurospheres in 5 days,
and the procedure of the subculture was repeated again to obtain NSCs
in passage 2 (P2) for further use. Immunofluorescence staining was
used to identify the stemness of the NSCs.

To identify the optimal
concentration of hE-cad-Fc for the adhesion and growth of NSCs, the
cells were cultured on the ECP with different concentrations and observed
with a light microscope (Leica, Germany) everyday for three days.
Moreover, CCK-8 assay was performed to observe the proliferation of
NSCs on the ECP at day 1, 2, and 3. The optimal concentration was
used for further experiments.

To examine the differentiation
capacity of NSCs grown on the ECP
compared with the TCP, NSCs (P2) were cultured in the TCP and ECP,
respectively, at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 in the complete culture medium described above and incubated
for 4 days at 37 °C. Then, the spontaneous differentiation of
NSCs was induced by applying the culture medium without the EGF and
bFGF (differentiation culture medium) for another 4 days. The cells
were observed with a light microscope everyday and the culture medium
was changed every 3 days. At day 8, the cells were collected for immunofluorescence
staining and the RT-PCR.

For the long-term identification of
stemness maintenance, NSCs
(P2) were then cultured in the TCP and ECP for three passages to obtain
NSCs of passage 5 [NSCs (P5)], and the cells were collected for the
RT-PCR. The passaging of NSCs was carried out every 5 days. In addition,
NSCs on the ECP of each generation from P2 to P5 were used to perform
CCK-8 assay to identify the proliferation capacity with the increase
of the subculture. NSCs (P5) on ECP were again cultured on TCP and
ECP, and immunofluorescence staining was applied.

The main cell
culture procedure is illustrated in Figure 1.

2.3 Cell Proliferation Assay
For CCK-8
assay, the NSCs of each passage obtained on the ECP were seeded into
48-well E-cad-coated plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells per well (n = 4). At day 1, 3, 5, and 7,
the cultured cells were incubated with 300 μL of 10% CCK-8 working
solution in the complete culture medium for 2 h at 37 °C in the
dark. Then, 100 μL of the supernatant was extracted to a new
96-well plate, and the optical density (OD) value at 450 nm was measured
by an EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, USA).

2.4 Immunofluorescence Staining
All samples
were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min and then washed three times
in PBS. Then, the fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X
in PBS for 5 min and later washed with PBS three times, and the cells
were then blocked with 10% goat serum (Gibco, USA) in PBS for 30 min
at room temperature. After removal of the blocking reagent, the cells
were incubated with primary antibody dilution, including rabbit anti-Nestin
(1:250, ab92391, Abcam), mouse anti-GFAP (1:300, 3670S, CST), rabbit
anti-β-tubulin III (1:1000, ab18207, Abcam), rabbit anti-MAP2
(1:1000, ab32454, Abcam), mouse anti-Oligodencyte Marker O4 (1:50,
O7139, Sigma), and mouse anti-NF (1:800, Abcam) at 4 °C overnight.
The secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor
594, 1:200, ab150084, Abcam) and goat anti-mouse IgG H&L (Alexa
Fluor 488, 1:200, ab150117, Abcam), were used to react with the cells
for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the cells were washed with PBS,
and the nucleus was stained with DAPI for 5 min. The samples were
visualized by indirect fluorescence under the fluorescent microscope
(Leica, Germany), confocal fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss LSM 780,
Germany), or fluorescence microscopy Olympus IX81 (Olympus, Japan).

2.5 Real-Time Fluorescence Quantitative PCR
Total mRNA was obtained by the miRcute miRNA Isolation Kit (DP501,
Tiangen, Beijing, China) and then reverse-transcribed to cDNA using
the FastQuant RT Kit (KR-106, Tiangen, Beijing, China). RT-PCR was
performed on the CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.
China) with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (172-5122, Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc. China). The primer pairs used for amplification
are listed in Table S1. Three replicate
samples were analyzed for each gene (n = 3). Each
sample was measured three times, and the average was calculated to
serve as the expression level of the gene in the sample. Relative
gene expression levels were determined by the 2–ΔΔCt method, and the target genes were normalized to
the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) housekeeping
gene as an internal control.

2.6 Statistical Analysis
All numerical
data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). SPSS 23.0
software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical
procedures. Statistical comparisons were performed with the t-test for independent samples or one-way analysis of variance
for multigroup comparisons, followed by Tukey’s HSD post hoc
test (equal variances) or Dunnett’s T3 post hoc test (unequal
variances). The values were considered to be significantly different,
when the p-value was less than 0.05.

3 Results
3.1 Preparation and Characterization
of the E-Cadherin-Coated
Substrate
The water contact angle of ECP (40.7° ±
5.4°) was significantly smaller than that of the PS surface (82.0°
± 4.0°), as shown in Figure 2A,B. The topography of the ECP investigated by AFM
(Figure 2C) showed
uniformly distributed nanostructures with the height of around 10
nm on average compared with the PS surface, which was smooth. These
results indicated that hE-cad-Fc was effectively immobilized on the
PS surface and could enhance the surface wettability.

angles and (B) statistical comparison of PS and ECP. (C) Topography
of PS and ECP. The data were reported as mean ± SD, n = 5. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

3.2 Adhesion and Proliferation
of NSCs in Response
to Different Concentrations of hE-Cad-Fc
The purity of isolated
NSCs plays an important role in this study because the cells taken
from the cortexes of the fetal SD rats may contain neurons, oligodendrocytes,
or astrocytes which could affect the results of differentiation. Expression
of the NSC marker Nestin, differentiating neuron markers MAP2 and
β-tubulin III, and the astrocyte marker GFAP was examined and
analyzed with immunofluorescence staining, as shown in Figure S1. All images were acquired with the
same conditions. Although most of the cells stain positive for Nestin,
very few of the cells were positive for MAP2, β-tubulin III,
and GFAP, which indicated that the isolated NSCs had high purity and
could be used for further experiments.

As shown in Figure S2, most NSCs aggregated and formed neurospheres
at day 3 when cultured on the ECP with concentrations of 0, 1.25,
2.5, and 5 μg/mL hE-cad-Fc. However, when the concentrations
were higher than 10 μg/mL, almost all the NSCs were dispersed,
and in monolayer conditions at day 1, there were no significant changes
in adhesion with the concentrations increase. CCK-8 results indicated
that NSCs grew the fastest and had the highest OD value at day 3 on
the ECP with 15 μg/mL of hE-cad-Fc (Figure S3). Therefore, a concentration of 15 μg/mL was better
for NSC adhesion and proliferation and used for further experiments
in this study.

3.3 Adhesion, Proliferation,
and Differentiation
of NSCs (P2)
NCSs (P2) were cultured on the TCP and ECP for
8 days. In the first 4 days, they were provided with the complete
culture medium with growth factors, and the cells in both kinds of
plates showed a good capacity for self-renewal indicated by everyday
observation with a light microscope, as shown in Figure 3. In the TCP, the cells grew
to neurospheres and the size and shape of neurospheres were very uniform
at day 3. At day 4, some neurospheres grew so big that the cells started
stretching out from the spheres, which was usually a sign for the
subculture, and then the differentiation culture medium was applied.
In the ECP, NSCs adhered on the bottom of the plate, exhibited individual
cells with scattering morphology, and intercellular connections were
formed between the cell-like network through their protrusions, which
was different from the cells on the TCP. According to the pictures
of NSCs by light microscopy in Figure 3, the diameters of neurospheres on the TCP and the
density of NSCs on the ECP were increasing in 4 days obviously, indicating
that cells on both the TCP and ECP exhibited fast proliferation.

Figure 3 Cell adhesion
and morphology of NSCs (P2) on the TCP and ECP at
day 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Under EGF and bFGF withdrawal,
NSCs on both the TCP and ECP can
differentiate into neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. After
spontaneous differentiation for 4 days, NSCs on the TCP and ECP were
stained for the undifferentiated NSC marker Nestin, neuronal marker
MAP2, astrocyte marker GFAP, and oligodendrocyte marker O4, as shown
in Figure 4A,B, where
“TCP” and “ECP” indicated cells supplied
with the complete culture medium for all 8 days, while the “TCP-I”
and “ECP-I” indicated cells induced by the differentiation
culture medium. On the TCP, large numbers of cells migrated out from
the neurospheres and grew axons with the increasing culture time,
which showed a similar morphology as cells on the ECP. Before differentiation,
NSCs showed a higher expression of Nestin and almost no expression
of GFAP, MAP2, and O4 on the TCP and ECP, indicating the good stemness
maintenance for up to 8 days. After differentiation, cells of the
TCP-I and ECP-I exhibited a higher positive staining of MAP2, GFAP,
and O4 and lower of Nestin compared with undifferentiated cells, which
demonstrated that cells had differentiated into neurons, oligodendrocytes,
or astrocytes. This result indicated that NSCs cultured on the ECP
could maintain the pluripotency to differentiate into all three neural
subtypes. In addition, NSCs of the TCP-I differentiated still in the
form of neurospheres, which made it hard to identify the changes of
individual cells inside and the percentage of a certain cell type.
However, the immunofluorescence staining in Figure 4B showed the NSC (in red), astrocyte (in
green), neuron (in red), and oligodendrocyte (in green) and exhibited
individual distribution without clear aggregation and inhomogeneity,
indicating that different kinds of cells on the ECP could get a relatively
uniform distribution after differentiation.

Figure 4 Immunofluorescence staining
of undifferentiated (A) and differentiated
(B) NSCs (P2) after the 8-day culture with Nestin (red, NSC marker),
MAP2 (red, neuronal marker), GFAP (green, astrocyte marker), and O4
(green, oligodendrocyte marker). The nuclei were stained with DAPI
(blue).

Real-time RT-PCR was conducted
to measure the relevant gene expression
levels in NSCs on the TCP, TCP-I, ECP, and ECP-I after spontaneous
differentiation at day 8, where TCP was regarded as a control (Figure 5). The gene expression
of Nestin and Sox2 (for NSCs) in the TCP-I and ECP-I exhibited significant
downregulation compared with TCP and ECP, while GFAP (for astrocytes),
Olig2 (for oligodendrocytes), and MBP (for mature oligodendrocytes)
exhibited significant upregulation compared with the TCP and ECP.
The expression of NeuN (for neurons) on the TCP was not significantly
different from that on TCP-I, but the expression on ECP-I was significantly
greater than that on the ECP. These results were consistent with the
immunofluorescence staining results. It is worth noting that the expressions
of Nestin and Sox2 of NSCs on the ECP were significantly higher than
those on the TCP, and the expression of NeuN was lower, indicating
that the ECP might have a better performance on maintaining the stemness
of NSCs when cultured for up to 8 days.

specific markers in NSCs (P2) cultured
on the ECP and TCP, including Nestin (A) and Sox2 (B) for NSCs, NeuN
(C) for neurons, GFAP (D) for astrocytes, and Olig2 (E) and MBP (F)
for oligodendrocytes. The expression was normalized to GAPDH. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

3.4 Proliferation Capacity of NSCs after Passaging
CCK-8 results of NSCs on the ECP are shown in Figure 6. From passage 2 to passage
5, NSCs exhibited the capacity of proliferation, while the efficiency
was different among generations, referred to as NSCs (P2), NSCs (P3),
NSCs (P4), and NSCs (P5). The quantities of cells cultured on the
ECP initially were controlled to be equal, and the OD values were
measured at day 1, 3, 5, and 7. At day 1, there was no significant
difference among the four groups. However, the OD value of NSCs (P5)
was significantly lower than those of NSCs (P2) and NSCs (P4) at day
3, 5, and 7. Although the OD value of NSCs (P3) was significantly
lower than that of NSCs (P5) at day 3, NSCs (P3) had a faster proliferation
than NSCs (P5), which was identified by a significantly higher OD
value at day 7. NSCs (P2) had the highest OD values at day 3, 5, and
7, which were significantly different from other groups. The OD values
of NSCs (P3) and NSCs (P4) were not significantly different at day
5 and 7. The results indicated that NSCs on the ECP could maintain
a good capacity of proliferation, however, decreasing with subcultures.

ECP.

3.5 Characteristics
of NSCs (P5)
NSCs
(P5) obtained from the TCP and ECP were analyzed by the RT-PCR, as
shown in Figure 7.
The TCP (P2) and ECP (P2) groups represented NSCs (P2) on the TCP
and ECP, respectively. TCP (P5) and ECP (P5) groups represented NSCs
(P5) on the TCP and ECP, respectively. The expressions of Nestin and
NeuN in the TCP (P5) and ECP (P5) were significantly reduced, while
the expressions of GFAP were significantly improved, compared with
those of TCP (P5) and ECP (P5), respectively. There were no significant
differences of the Olig2 expression among the four groups, indicating
an increasing inclination toward astrocytes rather than neurons and
oligodendrocytes of NSCs during generations. Moreover, the expression
of Nestin in ECP (P5) was significantly higher than that in TCP (P5),
indicating better stemness maintenance of NSCs on the ECP than the
TCP after the same generations of passaging.

Figure 7 Gene expressions of neural
specific markers in NSCs (P5) cultured
on the ECP and TCP, including Nestin (A) for NSCs, NeuN (B) for neurons,
GFAP (C) for astrocytes, and Olig2 (D) for oligodendrocytes. The expression
was normalized to GAPDH. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

To better identify the
properties of NSCs (P5) on the ECP, they
were again cultured on both the TCP and ECP to observe if NSCs maintained
a good capacity of self-renewal according to immunofluorescence staining
(Figure 8). It was
obvious that NSCs (P5) could still grow to form neurospheres. Most
of the cells were still positive for the Nestin marker no matter whether
on the TCP or ECP. However, cells positive for GFAP were more than
those in Figure 4A,
which were consistent with the results of RT-PCR.

4 Discussion
Recently,
optimizing protocols for stable proliferation and long-term
stemness maintenance is one of the central goals of stem cell research.29 NSCs on the ordinary tissue culture plastic
dish TCP incline to form neurospheres in serum-free media supplemented
with the EGF and bFGF. The sizes of the neurospheres are hard to control,
which are usually not uniform, especially for the long-term culture.
Moreover, the heterogeneity is ineluctable because the cells inside
the spheres can be exposed to suboptimal conditions, which are different
from the cells outside that can contact with the culture medium directly.30 Therefore, each cell of the neurosphere is likely
to locate in different cellular microenvironments, which makes it
difficult to get a large population of undifferentiated stem cells,
as the interaction with differentiating cells can expose NSCs to paracrine
factors that promote differentiation.29 However, the monolayer culture of NSCs has its own unique advantages
in some respects which can provide a solution to the above problems.
On the one hand, the construction of massive homogeneous cells without
affecting the self-renewal and differentiation capacities can be achieved
because of the uniform exposure to growth factors in the culture medium.
On the other hand, each cell can be directly monitored under monolayer
conditions, which is important to study the behavior of stem cells.31

In the present study, we used a recombinant
human E-cadherin mouse
IgG Fc chimera protein (hE-cad-Fc) that self-assembles on a hydrophobic
PS surface via the hydrophobic interaction to prepare an artificial
two-dimensional substrate for the NSC monolayer culture by mimicking
the cell–cell interaction in vivo and inside neurospheres.
The protein was applied onto the PS surface at a suitable concentration
and evaluated in terms of the effects on the stemness maintenance
and differentiation capacity of NSCs for a long-term culture compared
with the routine neurosphere culture on the TCP. According to the
results of the light microscope, NSCs exhibited a good adherent morphology
in the monolayer condition on the E-cadherin-based substrate, while
the cells formed different sizes of neurospheres on the TCP. The proliferation
of NSCs was in the form of higher cell density on the ECP while larger
neurospheres on the TCP. At first, the neurospheres were relatively
uniform in size, but they preferred to stick together and some of
the neurospheres grew larger than others. On day 4, large neurospheres
began to adhere onto the substrate with the central color darkening,
and cells grew from the inside, which was more obvious when cultured
continuously. However, the cells on the ECP maintained the monolayer
condition with a neat arrangement even for a long term. These results
were an indication that the cells in neurospheres were in a heterogeneous
microenvironment while those in the monolayer condition were in a
relatively homogeneous microenvironment, which could be one explanation
for the stemness maintenance on the ECP. The RT-PCR results showed
that the NSCs could maintain self-renewal capacity on the E-cadherin-based
substrate as well as on regular culture plates and could differentiate
to neurons, oligodendrocytes, or astrocytes spontaneously. Compared
with the TCP, the higher expressions of Nestin and Sox2 and the lower
expression of NeuN on the ECP after 8 days indicated better stemness
maintenance for a long-term culture at a certain generation of NSCs.
The expression of NeuN in differentiated cells on the ECP was significantly
higher than that of undifferentiated cells, but the difference between
differentiated and undifferentiated cells on the TCP was not significant,
which indicated that the ECP may promote some degree of neuronal differentiation.

To evaluate the long-term effect of the ECP on stemness maintenance,
NSCs were cultured for five passages because the NSCs used in various
studies were commonly under ten passages, in which the cells could
maintain relatively high stemness.32,33 In addition,
it was found in our experiments that the morphology uniformity and
proliferation rate of the NSCs went down with the increase of passaging
especially after five passages (data not shown). The aim of our study
was to obtain a homogeneous population of NSCs with the capacities
of self-renewal and differentiation for further studies and applications
of NSCs. Thus, the cells should be strictly in good condition; otherwise,
the results would be affected and would not accurately reflect the
role of our material. Therefore, the NSCs under five passages had
better biological properties and were enough for observing the long-term
stemness for the E-cadherin-based substrate. Compared with NSCs at
passage 2, cells at passage 5 on both the TCP and ECP exhibited a
decreased expression of Nestin and NeuN, but cells on the ECP showed
a significantly higher expression of Nestin than those on the TCP.
Moreover, NSCs cultured on the ECP from passage 2 to passage 5 could
maintain a good proliferation capacity, and even the cells at passage
5 could form Nestin-positive neurospheres and monolayers, indicating
the stemness maintenance for the long-term continuous passage culture.
From the above two aspects, the hE-cad-Fc protein could contribute
to maintain the self-renewal and differentiation capacities of NSCs
in the monolayer condition for a long term, compared to the neurosphere
culture. However, the expression of GFAP at passage 5 was higher than
that at passage 2 on both substrates, possibly caused by the accumulation
of astrocytes during passaging because no inducible factor was used
for the differentiation of NSCs.

The choice of 15 μg/mL
of the hE-cad-Fc protein was based
on both the previous study and our result in Figure S2, in which the cells exhibited good adhesion and proliferation.
The immobilization of the hE-cad-Fc protein increased with the concentration
rising from 0.1 to 10 μg/mL and became constant from 10 to 30
μg/mL, which indicated that hE-cad-Fc achieved saturation at
this concentration. The protein was also proved to have long-term
binding stability on the PS surface for at least 5 days.23 The promotion of cell adhesion with the concentration
of hE-cad-Fc increase was observed through the light microscope, during
which the attached phenotype of NSCs exhibited gradual alterations
from the neurosphere to the single cell, as shown in Figure S2. As we only changed the concentration of hE-cad-Fc
with other conditions unchanged, we think that the concentration of
hE-cad-Fc should be a key factor for NSC adhesion. The general range
of the hE-cadherin-Fc concentration was also determined based on the
results of immobilization and cell adhesion under different concentrations
in the study by Xu.24 However, the adhesion
mechanism of NSCs on the E-cadherin-based substrate was not shown
and will be investigated in the future. According to their studies,
the adhesion of the hMSCs on hE-cadherin-Fc was markedly inhibited
compared with the PS surface when an anti-human-E-cadherin antibody
was used as a blocker, indicating that the adhesion of hMSCs on the
modified surface was mediated by the E-cadherin domain. In addition,
the E-cadherin expression in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
(hMSCs) on hE-cadherin-Fc was distinctly higher than that on the TCP,
indicating that the hE-cadherin-Fc matrix could not only enhance cell
adhesion but simultaneously facilitate the expression of E-cadherin.
We think it is probably the same with NSCs. The adhesion of cells
was achieved via the combination of endogenous E-cadherin and exogenous
E-cadherin. The cells could not adhere to the PS surface unless there
were E-cadherin domains on the PS surface even with high endogenous
E-cadherin. Because the protein immobilization efficiency increased
with concentration, more NSCs would adhere on the modified surface
with a higher concentration. As a result, the adhesion behavior is
influenced by different concentrations of hE-cad-Fc on the substrate.
The in-depth mechanism including how the exogenous E-cadherin affects
the expression of endogenous E-cadherin of NSCs will be investigated
in our subsequent work.

The attempts to culture NSCs in monolayer
conditions were also
carried out by other studies. Sun et al. characterized the proliferative,
differentiative, and passaging capacities of neural stem and progenitor
cells (NSPCs) on adherent substrates coated with poly-d-lysine
and fibronectin in detail.32 Results showed
that adherent NSPCs grew significantly faster than neurospheres in
the P1 and P3 passages, but the self-renewal capacity in the adherent
culture reduced after the P5 passage, and the growth of cells within
neurospheres was slower than that in the adherent culture. Laminin
has been used for the monolayer culture of NSCs for many years, which
was identified to play important roles in mouse/human NSC propagation
and neuronal differentiation, allowing for niche-independent symmetric
self-renewal of NSCs.34,35 Sun et al. found that the laminin
substrate with EGF and FGF2 could promote the continuous proliferation
of human NSCs during one-year expansion, and switching the laminin
substrate to gelatin or uncoated substrates could cause cell detachment
and neurosphere formation.36 Different
from E-cadherin we used in this study, laminins and fibronectins are
both proteins of the ECM, related to cell adhesion, growth, and migration.37,38 Poly-d-lysine and poly-ornithine are also chemically synthesized
ECM used to facilitate cell adhesion via mimicking cell–matrix
interactions.39 The survival, proliferation,
self-renewal, and differentiation of NSCs involve a number of processes
that require not only cell–matrix interactions but also cell–cell
interactions.40 E-cadherin plays an important
role in mediating calcium-dependent, homophilic cell–cell adhesion
in all epithelial tissues including embryonic stem cells (ESCs).41 In addition, Karpowicz et al. confirmed the
presence of E-cadherin in neurospheres via immunocytochemistry and
found that the disruption or loss of E-cadherin attachment reduced
NSC self-renewal in vivo and in vitro.25 Therefore, the use of the E-cadherin-based substrate could commendably
mimic the cell–cell interaction among NSCs in niche and in
neurospheres. On the one hand, the advantages of the monolayer culture
can be retained, which contributes to expose all cells in the homogeneous
microenvironment containing nutrition and growth factors, avoiding
the gathering of differentiation paracrine factors within neurospheres.
On the other hand, E-cadherin plays a role of maintaining and promoting
the self-renewal capacity via its biological characteristics. Our
results showed that NSCs on the ECP maintained good self-renewal capacity
from passage 2 to passage 5, indicating that E-cadherin could perform
well as conventional coating components. In our study, the differentiation
of NSCs on the ECP (monolayer culture) and TCP (neurosphere culture)
was not obviously different according to the immunofluorescence results,
indicating that the culture on the ECP did not affect the spontaneous
differentiation of NSCs. However, more quantitative tests are needed
to evaluate the differentiation properties under two kinds of culture
conditions. Moreover, NSCs of passage 5 either on the TCP or ECP exhibited
lower Nestin and NeuN expressions and higher GFAP expression, indicating
the inclination of the differentiation to astrocytes, under which
circumstance we suggest using earlier passages of NSCs in some strict
studies.

The mechanism is being investigated. On the E-cadherin-coated
substrate,
NSCs exhibited scattering morphologies, which was in correspondence
with the ESC and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells cultured
under the same condition. E-cadherin has long extracellular and cytoplasmic
domains, which can establish interactions between cells and at the
same time associate with intracellular adaptor proteins such as β-catenin
and p120-catenin directly and α-catenin indirectly. Then, the
intracellular adaptor proteins link cell–cell adhesion to the
actin-myosin network and other intracellular signaling pathways.41 A previous study reported that activity of RhoA
and Rac1 contributed to the filopodia extension of mouse ESCs and
F9 embryonal carcinoma cells on the E-cadherin surface.42,43 According to the known effects of E-cadherin, we can assume that
the homogeneous interaction between cells and coated E-cadherin changes
the cytoskeleton via catenin and promotes the activity of RhoA and
Rac1, leading to cell scattering, which needs further studies.

Besides the simple culture of cells on plates, ECM proteins and
cadherins can also be used to modify complex scaffolds and allow stem
cells to grow better for tissue engineering.40 N-cadherin is also a member of the cell adhesion molecule expressed
on the surface of NSCs which is involved in cell migration and possesses
the ability to promote the growth and differentiation of stem cells.
Fusion chimeras of N-cadherin-Fc were used to coat polymer thin films
and electrospun scaffolds alone and in combination with L1-Fc. H9
NSCs were cultured on the scaffolds and the neuronal differentiation,
neurite outgrowth, and survival during oxidative stress were promoted.44 Self-assembled peptide hydrogels were prepared
with N-cadherin mimetic peptide conjugation, which could enhance the
chondrogenesis and osteogenesis of hMSCs.45,46 Furthermore, a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/chitosan/gelatin
scaffold was designed and modified with laminin to grow NSCs inside.
Results showed that the scaffold could promote NSC adhesion and proliferation
and enhance differentiation into neurons and astrocytes.33 Similarly, E-cadherin can be applied to the
modified natural or synthetic materials to promote the self-renewal
and differentiation properties of NSCs and other stem cells in the
scaffold, which is of great significance for cell therapy and tissue
engineering. Multicellular aggregates constructed with human E-cadherin
fusion protein-coated PLGA microparticles could enhance the adhesion
and hepatic-specific differentiation of hMSCs, providing a promising
method for the liver disease therapy and other endoderm-derived organ
construction.47

5 Conclusions
We successfully established the E-cadherin-based substrate through
the hydrophobic interaction with hydrophobic PS surfaces for the long-time
monolayer culture of NSCs. The hE-cad-Fc protein facilitated the generation
of homogeneous population of NSCs growing in the same adherent environment.
The cells on the ECP could maintain a good self-renewal capacity after
the 8-day culture and passaging, and the cells maintained the ability
to differentiate into neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Moreover,
the recombinant human E-cadherin mouse IgG Fc chimera protein is a
promising choice for the monolayer culture of NSCs and has a potential
for maintaining the self-renewal of stem cells in engineered nerve
tissue grafts via mimicking the cell–cell interaction.
