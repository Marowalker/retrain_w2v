D–A−π–A
dyes differ from the traditional
D−π–A framework having several merits in dye-sensitized
solar cell (DSSC) applications. With regard to D−π–A
dyes, D–A−π–A dyes red-shift absorption
spectra and show particular photostability. Nevertheless, the effects
of internal acceptor on the charge transfer (CT) probability are unclear.
We employed density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT),
and TD-DFT molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the
effects of internal acceptor on the photophysical properties of D–A−π–A
dyes on DSSCs. Our calculations show the absorption bands of D–A−π–A
dyes with strong electron-withdrawing internal acceptors exhibiting
significant characteristics of dual CT; the excited electron density
is transferred to the internal and terminal acceptors simultaneously.
Particularly, the internal acceptor traps a significant amount of
electron density upon photoexcitation. The TD-DFT MD simulations at
300 K show that only a small amount of excited electron density is
pushing and pulling between the internal acceptor and terminal acceptor
moieties; the thermal energy is not high enough to drive the electron
density from the internal acceptor to the terminal acceptor. Our study
reveals the nature of CT bands of D–A−π–A
dyes providing a theoretical basis for further rational engineering.

Introduction
The Sun has been considered as a promising
sustainable energy source.
Photovoltaic devices are regarded as optimal methods to directly convert
solar energy into electricity. Various technologies,1−3 such as crystalline Si, semiconductors (e.g., GaAs-based cells),
organic bulk heterojunction, and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),
can be used. DSSCs have the advantage of being lightweight in comparison
to inorganic semiconductor solar cells and have a higher conversion
efficiency4 than polymer-based bulky heterojunction
cells.5

In DSSC devices, the dye
sensitizers play the first and crucial
step in light harvesting. For higher light-harvesting efficiency,
the absorption spectra of dye sensitizers should be optimally matched
with the solar spectra and also have a larger extinction coefficient.
In addition, the transition characters of absorption spectra of dye
sensitizers influence and determine the efficiency of electron injection.
Moreover, the stability of photoexcited dye sensitizers will determine
the lifetime of DSSCs. To enhance the efficiency of DSSCs, researchers
are dedicated to engineering configurations of dye sensitizers to
optimize various entangled parameters as mentioned above.

DSSCs
based on organic dyes have several advantages. Metal-free
organic dyes are easily prepared and relatively less expensive. Moreover,
the more interesting feature of metal-free organic dyes is that their
absorption (wavelength range and extinction coefficients) and photoelectrical
properties (related to frontier molecular orbital energy level) are
adjustable through molecular engineering.6 Most metal-free organic sensitizers are typically designed to have
a donor−π–acceptor (D−π–A)
framework. D−π–A dyes with dipolar features are
designed with the aim of performing efficient photoinduced charge
transfer (CT). Previous studies have designed the dyes based on the
D−π–A framework in terms of engineering the donors
(e.g., triphenylamine (TPA), indoline, etc.)7,8 and
π-spacer (e.g., benzene, thiophene, etc.). Probably due to its
simple structure, the achievement of D−π–A DSSC
is more limited. Nevertheless, variation of the D−π–A
framework can lead to other frameworks of dyes. Recently, novel organic
dyes with a D–A−π–A9 configuration made by introducing an internal acceptor into the
traditional D−π–A structure have efficiencies
up to 10%.10,11 D–A−π–A
sensitizers employ an auxiliary electron-withdrawing group, known
as internal acceptors A; commonly used internal acceptors are quinoxaline,12 diketopyrrolopyrrole,13 isoindigo,14 bithiazole,15 benzothiadiazole (BTD),16 benzotriazole
(BT),17 2-methylbenzo[d]thiazole (DBT),18,19 and pyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine (PP).20 Previous comprehensive
studies21 on the model of D–A−π–A
showed that the internal electron-withdrawing acceptor can be regarded
as an “electron trap” and exhibits some distinguishing
characteristics: (i) Incorporation of an electron-withdrawing acceptor
into the D−π–A configuration tunes the molecular
energy gap; an acceptor owning a low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) is expected to reduce the LUMO of the whole molecule
red-shifting the absorption spectra when the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) of the whole molecule remains the same. Wang10 and co-workers introduced a BTD group into one
D−π–A dye, generating a new dye of D–A−π–A
configuration; the new D–A−π–A dye (D2
in the original literature) performed a red-shifted absorption of
556 nm relative to that of the original D−π–A
dye (λmax = 512 nm; D1 in the original literature).
(ii) Furthermore, it may result in a new absorption band in the UV–vis
region expanding the range of the light-harvesting response. In the
work of Wang et al.,10 the D2 molecule
has an extra absorption band at 466 nm and a prominent extinction
coefficient of up to 30 500 M–1 cm–1, whereas the D1 molecule shows a blue-shifted band at 363 nm with
a smaller extinction coefficient of 9300 M–1 cm–1. (iii) More importantly, it can significantly improve
the photostability.16 (iv) The structural
features of most internal acceptor units allow for facile structural
modification. In addition, their N-containing heterocycles are considered
to improve the Voc.22

The internal acceptor, no doubt having electron-withdrawing
ability,
is also expected to alter the electronic transition characteristics
of the absorption band, which is crucial for electron injection for
photo-to-current conversion. In particular, whether the internal acceptor
promotes or retards the electron transfer (ET) is still unclear.21 Conceptually, it is anticipated that the internal
acceptor can potentially trap a certain amount of photoexcited electron
density at the initial stage. However, it is not known whether the
D–A−π–A dye follows a two-step CT process
driven by thermal energy. In a two-step CT process, the internal acceptor
receives electron density from the donor upon photoexcitation. Thereafter,
thermal energy drives the photoexcited electron density on the internal
acceptor toward the terminal acceptor for electron injection. Moreover,
introduction of an internal acceptor into a D−π–A
dye is not assured to give a red-shifted spectra and a better performance
of Jsc. In the work of Zhu et al.,23 the LS-1 molecule (in the original literature)
with a D−π–A framework has a λmax of 483 nm and gives a Jsc value of 11.25
mA cm–2; retaining the same D and A moieties, the
LS-2 with a D–A−π–A framework has a blue-shifted
λmax of 442 nm and gives a lower Jsc value of 10.06 mA cm–2. Therefore,
theoretical investigation of the effects of the internal acceptor
in the D–A−π–A dyes on the photophysical
properties, in particular the features of absorption spectra, as well
as electron-transfer characters, is needed for rational engineering
of novel D–A−π–A dyes for better DSSC applications.

To elucidate the effects of the internal acceptor underlying the
complex D–A−π–A configurations, we employed
density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT), and
TD-DFT nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate four
D–A−π–A molecules and one D−π–A
molecule, as displayed in Figure 1. The D−π–A molecule (Figure 1e) is used for parallel
comparison. These five molecules were carefully selected from published
literature containing rich experimental data. In particular, they
share several common features, providing us with suitable systems
to comparatively elucidate the effects of the internal acceptor on
the photophysical properties from the complex interrelated experimental
data. The five molecules studied have the same electron-donating group
(triphenylamine, TPA), π-spacer (Th), and acceptor/anchor (cyanoacrylic
acid, CAA). The only structural variation between the four D–A−π–A
molecules is the internal acceptor located between the donor and the
π-spacer. In addition, the internal acceptors have similar molecular
structure but with different physical properties (e.g., HOMO–LUMO
(H–L) gap). Moreover, our calculations in this study (vide
infra) show that they own a planar A−π–A moiety
and thus have similar molecular length. Nevertheless, they have distinct
UV–vis spectra and photo-to-current conversion efficiency.
Experimentally, the TPA-DBT-Th-CAA molecule (Figure 1c) has λmax at 423 nm, which
is close to that of the D−π–A molecule (Figure 1e, λmax = 417 nm). Replacement of DBT by BTD gives the TPA-BTD-Th-CAA molecule
having a significantly red-shifted spectrum of 497 nm. Our theoretical
calculations reveal that the primary absorption of D–A−π–A
molecules has electron density transferred to the internal acceptor
and terminal acceptor moieties at the same time upon photoexcitation,
which is significantly different from the commonly observed D-to-A
transition in the D−π–A molecules. Moreover, we
show that the thermal energy at 300 K has limited effect in further
promoting the excited electron density on the internal acceptor to
the terminal acceptor side.

Results and Discussion
Studied Molecules
The sensitizers
displayed in Figure 1 have similar molecular
configuration having a triphenylamine (TPA) moiety as the electron-donating
group, a thiophene (Th) unit as the π-spacer, and cyanoacrylic
acid (CAA) as the terminal acceptor/anchor. These units were chosen
mainly because they are frequently used in dye sensitizers:24−26 TPA belongs to the electron-rich aryl amine family; Th has excellent
charge-transport properties; and the cyanoacrylic acid group consists
of strong electron-withdrawing moieties of the cyano and carboxyl
groups.1,27 The internal acceptors A have a low-lying
LUMO and a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap. For convenience, these studied
molecules were named by the sequence combination of the abbreviations
of their donor, internal acceptor, π-spacer, and terminal acceptor/anchor.
For example, the molecule TPA-BTD-Th-CAA (Figure 1a) uses one TPA as the donor, one benzothiadiazole
(BTD) as the internal acceptor, one Th as the π-spacer, and
CAA as the terminal acceptor/anchor. Therefore, our studied molecules
have the molecular framework of TPA-A-Th-CAA except for TPA-Ph-Th-CAA
(Figure 1e). TPA-Ph-Th-CAA
is a reference D−π–A dye with a very similar structure
to other TPA-A-Th-CAA molecules, but without the internal acceptor
unit. It is used for parallel comparison.

Four acceptors were
introduced into the abovementioned molecular framework as an internal
acceptor and were investigated. TPA-BTD-Th-CAA (Figure 1a), developed by Tian, Wang, and co-workers,16 incorporates benzothiadiazole (BTD) as an internal
acceptor to bridge the TPA (donor) and the Th (spacer). The BTD unit
has been widely applied for engineering organic solar cells mainly
due to its narrow band gap and strong electron-withdrawing ability.28−32 The introduced internal BTD acceptor is expected to function as
an electron trap, which increases the efficiency of charge separation.
TPA-BT-Th-CAA sensitizers (Figure 1b) have benzotriazole (BT) introduced into the sensitizer
as an internal acceptor developed by Hua et al.17 In particular, BT is a close analogue of BTD; however,
BT is electron-rich, leading to a higher LUMO energy level.33 TPA-DBT-Th-CAA (Figure 1c) was developed by Yu, Ma, and co-workers.18 2-methylbenzo[d]thiazole (DBT)
has a nonplanar structure, which is expected to avoid the aggregation
of the dyes and thus increases
the lifetime of the excited state. TPA-PP-Th-CAA20 (Figure 1d) has a pyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine (PP) unit as the
internal acceptor.20 PP is well known to
have electron-withdrawing ability due to its unsaturated nitrogen
atoms. It has shown promising photovoltaic properties in polymer structures
for near-infrared light-emitting diodes.

Energy Level of Building
Blocks
Figure 2 displays the HOMO and LUMO energy levels
and HOMO–LUMO (H–L) energy gap of the “building
blocks” of studied molecules, including TPA, Th, Ph, CAA, as
well as four internal acceptors, BTD, BT, PP, and BTD, calculated
at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level based on their optimized structures
by B3LYP/6-31G(d,p). The TPA moiety has the highest HOMO energy level,
facilitating the donation of electrons. The CAA moiety has the lowest
LUMO level and thus the largest driving force to accept electron density.
The Ph and Th groups designed as π-spacers have relatively high-energy
LUMO, which is less capable of trapping electrons, instead assisting
the electron transportation and also extending the π-conjugation
length.

at CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The bottom
bars represent the HOMO energy; the top bars represent the LUMO energy.
The HOMO–LUMO energy gaps are shown in the middle.

Four internal acceptors exploited in this study
have low-lying
LUMO levels and a smaller H–L energy gap. Nevertheless, they
have distinct LUMO energy levels and an H–L energy gap, providing
us suitable models to understand their effects on the photophysical
properties of D–A−π–A organic sensitizers.
Among them, BTD has the lowest-energy LUMO and a smaller H–L
gap and DBT has the highest-energy LUMO and the largest H–L
gap. The order of LUMO energy level of the four internal acceptors
is DBT > BT > PP > BTD. The magnitude of the H–L gap
of these
four internal acceptors is correlated with their LUMO energy levels.

Ground-State Molecular Geometries
Figure 3 shows the lengths of C–C
bonds connecting two neighboring building blocks and their associated
dihedral angles. As the building blocks are aromatic rings, in which
their structures are less sensitive to the chemical environments,
instead, the dihedral angles and bond lengths between two neighboring
aromatic rings can determine their photophysical properties. The bond
lengths between two neighboring aromatic rings of studied molecules
are between 1.34 Å (standard carbon–carbon double-bond
length) and 1.54 Å (standard carbon–carbon single-bond
length). This indicates that these bonds are partially conjugated
within the molecule. We define four dihedral angles (depicted in Figure 3a), ϕ1 (between the Ph ring on TPA and internal acceptor ring), ϕ2 (between internal acceptor ring and Th ring), ϕ3 (between Th ring and C=C double bond), and ϕ4 (between CN and C=O groups), which may potentially
change with different internal acceptors. As expected, the TPA moiety
has a propeller-like nonplanar geometry. The Ph ring on TPA forms
a certain twisted angle (ϕ1) with its neighboring
ring; such a twisted angle may retard the electron back donation after
photoexcitation. The ϕ2, ϕ3, and
ϕ4 angles of TPA-BTD-Th-CAA, TPA-BT-Th-CAA, TPA-DBT-Th-CAA,
and TPA-PP-Th-CAA are close to 0°, having a nearly planar A−π–A
motif. Therefore, TPA-BTD-Th-CAA, TPA-BT-Th-CAA, TPA-DBT-Th-CAA, and
TPA-PP-Th-CAA have similar molecular structures. The planar A−π–A
motif can extend the π-conjugation length. On the other hand,
ϕ2 of TPA-Ph-Th-CAA, due to the Th–Ph steric
repulsion, is 20.7°, having a nonplanar Ph–Th motif, which
reduces the effective π-conjugation length of the whole molecule.

UV–Vis Spectra of Dye in Solution
Table 1 lists the optical data of studied
dyes in solution obtained from both experimental observations and
TD-DFT calculations. Experimentally, the studied molecules have the
λmax bands located at 417–500 nm. The λmax bands of TPA-BTD-Th-CAA, TPA-BT-Th-CAA, TPA-DBT-Th-CAA,
TPA-PP-Th-CAA, and TPA-Ph-Th-CAA appear at 497, 454, 423, 500, and
417 nm, respectively. In particular, TPA-Ph-Th-CAA has the most blue-shifted
band. These results reveal that replacement of the Ph by an internal
acceptor, while maintaining the planarity of A-Th-CAA moiety, red-shifts
the spectra. Furthermore, the magnitude of red shift in the spectra
after introducing an internal acceptor moiety is correlated with the
H–L gap and LUMO energy level of the internal acceptor. The
calculated λmax bands of dyes are in good agreement
with the experimental observations. The average absolute deviation
between the calculated λmax values for these molecules
in solution and those observed experimentally is 10.8 nm. The smallest
deviation from the experimental value is only +2 nm (in TPA-BTD-Th-CAA),
and the largest deviation from the experimental value is −25
nm (in TPA-PP-Th-CAA). Experimentally, TPA-BTD-Th-CAA (εmax = 13 000 M–1 cm–1) and TPA-PP-Th-CAA (εmax = 16 700 M–1 cm–1) have the smallest εmax values of the λmax bands. These results
indicate that introduction of strong electron-withdrawing moieties,
such as BTD and PP, reduces the absorption coefficients of the λmax bands. Similar results are also observed in other studies
of D–A−π–A molecule. WS-2 (εmax = 16 700 M–1 cm–1) has a D–A−π–A framework using the BTD
moiety, as internal acceptor has a smaller εmax value
than its D−π–A analogue (LS-1 in the original
literature; εmax = 21 000 M–1 cm–1).16 Computationally,
TPA-BTD-Th-CAA gives the smallest oscillator strength, whereas the
CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method predicts that TPA-PP-Th-CAA has a similar
oscillator strength to TPA-Ph-Th-CAA.

The D–A−π–A molecules exhibit
second
higher-energy absorption bands. Experimentally, the second bands for
TPA-BTD-Th-CAA and TPA-PP-Th-CAA appear at 395 and 423 nm, respectively.
More importantly, the second bands of TPA-BTD-Th-CAA and TPA-PP-Th-CAA
appear in the visible (vis)-light region, which can potentially contribute
to the photo-to-current conversion. Experimentally, the second absorption
band of the TPA-Ph-Th-CAA molecule is located at ∼310 nm, which
is poorly spectrally matched with solar spectra. Molecules with the
introduction of larger H–L acceptors, such as TPA-BT-Th-CAA
and TPA-DBT-Th-CAA, do not have red-shifted second absorption band.
Except for TPA-PP-Th-CAA, other molecules have weaker second absorption
band than the corresponding λmax bands. The calculated
second absorption bands of dyes have larger deviations from the experimental
observations than those of the λmax bands. The average
absolute deviation between the calculated second absorption bands
for these molecules in solution and those observed experimentally
is 36.2 nm. These results indicate that the CAM-B3LYP method has better
performance in reproducing the visible absorption than near UV absorption.

Table 2 lists the
transition characters of the absorption bands. The major contribution
of the electronic density transition of λmax bands
is from HOMO to LUMO transition, and the minor contribution is from
low-lying HOMO – 1 to LUMO transition. On the other hand, the
major contribution of the electronic density transition of the second
bands is from low-lying HOMO – 1 to LUMO transition, and the
minor contribution is from HOMO to LUMO and from HOMO to higher-energy
LUMO + 1 transitions. Table 3 lists the electron density difference map (EDDM) (where the
excited electron density is coming from and going to) of absorption
bands upon photoexcitation. The EDDM shows that the λmax and second bands of studied molecules have electron density mainly
coming from the electron-donating TPA moiety; however, the character
of excited electron density is distinctly different. The λmax bands of TPA-BTD-Th-CAA and TPA-PP-Th-CAA exhibit a dual
charge-transfer character; the electron density is significantly transferred
from the TPA moiety to both the internal acceptor and CAA moieties
simultaneously upon photoexcitation. Upon excitation, TPA-BTD-Th-CAA
has the electron density of the BTD and CAA moieties increased by
31 and 18%, respectively. For TPA-PP-Th-CAA, the electron density
of the PP and CAA moieties is increased by 29 and 20%, respectively,
upon excitation. Particularly, the internal acceptor moieties of TPA-BTD-Th-CAA
and TPA-PP-Th-CAA receive more electron density than their corresponding
CAA moieties. The short-range CT (to internal acceptor) has a higher
probability than the long-range CT (to CAA). Similar EDDM results
are also observed for the second absorption bands of TPA-BTD-Th-CAA
and TPA-PP-Th-CAA; the second absorption bands of TPA-BTD-Th-CAA and
TPA-PP-Th-CAA are dual CT bands. Interestingly, for the second absorption
bands of TPA-BTD-Th-CAA and TPA-PP-Th-CAA, the electron density of
Th moiety is nearly unchanged before and after excitation. On the
other hand, the excited electron density of the λmax and second absorption bands of TPA-DBT-Th-CAA and TPA-Ph-Th-CAA
is mainly transferred to the CAA moiety, and the electron density
of the internal acceptor moiety is slightly decreased upon photoexcitation.
These results indicate that the λmax and second absorption
bands of TPA-DBT-Th-CAA and TPA-Ph-Th-CAA are single CT bands. For
TPA-BT-Th-CAA, upon excitation on the λmax band,
the excited electron density of the Th and CAA moieties is increased
by 20 and 29%, respectively, and that of the BT is slightly increased
by 8%. Similarly, upon excitation on the second absorption band of
TPA-BT-Th-CAA, the excited electron density is mainly transferred
to Th (increased by 10%) and CAA (increased by 23%) moieties.

is the most red-shifted molecule, and TPA-Ph-Th-CAA is the most blue-shifted

1 to LUMO. The λmax transition of TPA-Ph-Th-CAA is
a mixed one, that is, from the two highest occupied orbitals to the
two lowest unoccupied orbitals.

b H = HOMO; L = LUMO.

For the first band (λmax), the transition characters
of four D–A−π–A molecules adsorbed on a
(TiO2)38 cluster are mainly from the HOMO and
HOMO – 1 to LUMO, which are similar to those in solution. On
the other hand, the transition character of the TPA-Ph-Th-CAA dye
mixes more higher-energy LUMO + 1 orbitals, whose electron densities
are mainly localized on TiO2.

Table 5 lists the
EDDM (before and after photoexcitation) for dyes adsorbed on a (TiO2)38 cluster. TPA-BTD-Th-CAA, after photoexcitation,
has the electron density redistributed onto the BTD and CAA/(TiO2)38 moieties, increasing by the same amount of
25%. For TPA-PP-Th-CAA, the electron density on the PP and CAA/(TiO2)38 moieties is increased by 23 and 28%, respectively,
after excitation. These results indicate that the λmax bands of TPA-BTD-Th-CAA and TPA-PP-Th-CAA are apparently dual-charge-transfer
bands. These two dyes adsorbed on TiO2 have minor electron
density delocalized onto TiO2 (<10%). In contrast, TPA-Ph-Th-CAA
has most electron density delocalized onto TiO2 (61%),
showing the λmax a strong single CT band. Upon adsorption
on TiO2 and after photoexcitation, the electron density
of DBT on TPA-DBT-Th-CAA is slightly decreased and moderate electron
density is redistributed onto TiO2; λmax of TPA-DBT-Th-CAA is a single CT band. For TPA-BT-Th-CAA, the electron
density on CAA/(TiO2)38 is significantly increased,
a character of a single CT band. In general, upon adsorption onto
TiO2 (a sink for electron acceptor), the capacity of the
internal acceptor in receiving electron density is decreased relative
to that in solution. For the blue-shifted band of a given dye, TiO2 receives more electron density than the λmax band. These results may be due to that the higher-energy transition
of dyes (mainly LUMO) is better hybridized with the interfacial orbitals
in the conduction band (CB) region of TiO2 with high density
of states.

density is coming from) and after (where the excited electron density

TPA-BTD-Th-CAA and TPA-PP-Th-CAA with strong internal acceptors
have red-shifted absorption spectra and additional bands in the UV–vis
region. Therefore, their absorption bands are better matched with
solar spectra than other studied dyes, and in principle, they should
have higher Jsc values. Nevertheless,
their experimentally measured Jsc values
(TPA-BTD-Th-CAA = 11.216 mA cm–2 and TPA-PP-Th-CAA = 7.120 mA cm–2) are smaller than or close to those of TPA-Ph-Th-CAA (13.8634 mA cm–2), TPA-BT-Th-CAA (11.8817 mA cm–2), and TPA-DBT-Th-CAA
(10.0414 mA cm–2). One
of the possible reasons for these results is that the strong internal
acceptors, BTD and PP, trap the excited electron density and thus
reduce the efficiency of charge transfer/injection to TiO2. This hypothesis is supported by our calculations that BTD and PP
moieties trap significant amounts of excited electron density.

Excited-State
Oxidation Potential and Photostability
Figure 4 shows the
calculated excited-state oxidation potential (ESOP) aligned by the
method proposed by De Angelis and colleagues.35,36 The aligned excited-state energy also represents excited-state oxidation
potential (ESOP). The exact ESOP is calculated by ESOP = (G – G+)ES,
which is the free-energy difference between neutral and oxidized molecules
in the excited state at the equilibrium geometry of neutral species.
The ESOP can be approximated by ESOP ≅ GSOP – Eo–o, where GSOP is the ground-state oxidation
potential (GSOP) calculated by (G – G+)GS and Eo–o is the energy difference between optimized excited and ground states.
For large systems, such as dye adsorbed on TiO2, it is
not feasible to optimize the excited-state geometry. The Eo–o is approximated by vertical excitation energy.
We first calculated the ground-state oxidation potential (GSOP) by
computing the energy difference of dyes adsorbed on a (TiO2)38 cluster in its neutral and cation states based on
the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method. The ESOP is calculated by adding the
absorption energy (Eabs) calculated at
CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to the GSOP. In conjunction with the EDDM
analysis above, it is seen that TPA-Ph-Th-CAA has a large driving
force for electron injection as well as strong coupling with TiO2. On the other hand, the D–A−π–A
dyes have a smaller driving force for electron injection to TiO2; moreover, the coupling of their excited state with the TiO2 is relatively weaker. In particular, introduction of a strong
electron-withdrawing BTD group results in a small driving force as
well as a weak coupling with TiO2.

Figure 4 Energy alignment of dyes
adsorbed on TiO2. The bottom
bars represent the GSOP; the top bars represent the aligned ESOP.
The experimental CB energy of TiO2 (−3.94 eV) is
shown on the left.

The photostability of
dyes will directly affect the duration time
of DSSC devices. In principle, a photoexcited dye with lower energy
is expected to be less active in undergoing photochemical reactions
and vice versa. The calculated ESOP values (Figure 4) of TPA-BTD-Th-CAA, TPA-BT-Th-CAA, TPA-DBT-Th-CAA,
TPA-PP-Th-CAA, and TPA-Ph-Th-CAA adsorbed on a (TiO2)38 cluster are −2.72, −2.56, −2.36, −2.66,
and −2.19 eV, respectively. The four studied D–A−π–A
dyes adsorbed on TiO2 have lower ESOP values than the D−π–A
TPA-Ph-Th-CAA dye adsorbed on TiO2. These results indicate
that the insertion of an internal acceptor into a D−π–A
framework can potentially improve the photostability. In particular,
TPA-BTD-Th-CAA has 0.53 eV lower ESOP than TPA-Ph-Th-CAA. Previous
study has shown that the introduction of the electron-deficient BTD
moiety can significantly improve the photostability of indoline-based
organic sensitizers.16 Our calculations
suggest that the D–A−π–A dye has lower
ESOP and is potentially more photostable.

TD-DFT Nonadiabatic Molecular
Dynamics Simulations
The fast photoinduced ET process from
the donor to the acceptor was
investigated by TD-DFT nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
on the femtosecond scale with atomistic details. These NAMD simulations
address the CT mechanism of D–A−π–A molecules
driven by thermal energy after photoexcitation. Thermal motions of
atomic nucleus generate a nonuniform distribution of photoexcited
states that are predominantly significant in driving the CT process.
In the ground state, thermal motions of the atoms create the ensemble
with slightly different molecular geometries corresponding to the
inhomogeneous broadening of the absorption spectra that thus influences
the energies of the donor and acceptor. On the other hand, the chemical
bonds of photoexcited molecules are considered to be weaker than those
in the ground state. Therefore, how thermal fluctuations of the atoms
at the photoexcited state affect the energies of donor and acceptor
and the CT character need to be investigated. Photoexcitation creates
the initial charge separation. The EDDM analysis of the zero-temperature
UV–vis spectra discussed above shows that the electron density
of the photoexcited state is partially delocalized onto the acceptor
moiety at the Franck–Condon state. In particular, the excited
electron density of photoexcited TPA-BTD-Th-CAA is mainly delocalized
onto the BTD and CAA moieties at the same time. One interesting question
is whether the thermal energy promotes the second CT process from
the internal to the terminal acceptor.

Figure 5 shows the EDDM (where the excited electron
density is going to) of four building units of first singlet excited
TPA-BTD-Th-CAA molecule as a function of simulation time. After photoexcitation,
the excited electron has several possible pathways; it can delocalize
more electron density to the acceptor or the electron density on the
acceptor can move back to the internal acceptor and even to the donor.
It is seen that the electron density on the TPA moiety remains in
a steady state with low and stable electron population with a small
variance of 0.0002. The electron population on the BTD unit has a
large value and a relatively large fluctuation with a variance of
0.0017. On the CAA moiety, the electron population has a variance
of 0.0006. No significant amount of electron density populated on
CAA moiety is observed. These results indicate that only a small amount
of electron density has been pushed and pulled between the internal
BTD acceptor and the terminal CAA acceptor. The excited electron density
redistribution is less sensitive to thermal motions.

Figure 5 EDDM (where the electron
density is going to) of four building
units (TPA, BTD, Th, and CAA) of TPA-BTD-Th-CAA molecule at the S1 state as a function of simulation time.

Figure 6 shows
that
the first excited-state energy of TPA-BTD-Th-CAA molecule evolves
with time. The variance of energy is 0.12 eV, which is approximately
equal to eight atoms that contribute to change in the electronic energies
at 300 K. As shown in Figure 2, the BTD unit has a lower LUMO energy than the CAA moiety
by 0.31 eV, which is larger than the variance of excited energy. One
of the possible reasons that the excited electron density is rarely
pushed to the CAA moiety by thermal energy is the thermal energy lower
than the electronic energy difference between the BTD and CAA moieties.
That is, the BTD unit traps a significant amount of excited electron
density.

Conclusions and Summary
In this study, we employed
DFT, TD-DFT, and TD-DFT nonadiabatic
MD simulations to investigate the photophysical properties of four
D–A−π–A dyes and one D−π–A
dye in solution and adsorbed on a (TiO2)38 cluster.
Our main conclusions are summarized as follows:1. Introduction of a strong electron-withdrawing
group into the D−π–A framework effectively induces
red shifts in absorption due to the small band gap and low-lying LUMO
of internal acceptor A.

2. In addition, a strong electron-withdrawing
group A, such as the BTD and PP moieties, generates a new band in
the UV–visible region, which potentially contributes to the
photo-to-current conversion.

3. D–A−π–A
dyes exhibit distinct transition characters of absorption. Strong
electron-withdrawing groups, such as BTD and PP, induce dual CT bands.
The excited electron density is transferred from the TPA donor to
the internal and terminal acceptors simultaneously, whereas weaker
electron-withdrawing group does not. The strong electron-withdrawing
groups trap the electron density and hamper the electron density transferred
to the terminal acceptor upon photoexcitation.

4. TiO2 serving as the electron
acceptor can assist in delocalizing the excited electron density from
the internal acceptor to the CAA/TiO2 side upon photoexcitation.

5. Thermal energy of 300 K,
applied in
TD-DFT nonadiabatic MD simulations, drives the excited electron density
fluctuation between the internal and terminal acceptors, whereas it
has limited effect in pushing significant electron density toward
the terminal acceptor. It seems that the thermal energy is not populated
high enough on proper vibrational modes to drive a significant amount
of photoexcited electron density on internal acceptor to the terminal
acceptor.

6. Introduction
of an internal acceptor
with small band gap results in the D–A−π–A
dyes a lower ESOP relative to the analogous D−π–A
dyes, giving significant features of photostability. These results
support experimental observations.



Our
study provides new insights into the nature of the absorption
bands of D–A−π–A dyes, giving pointers
about how to improve the performance of newly designed D–A−π–A
dyes.

Computational Methods
The density functional theory
(DFT) implemented within Gaussian
09 program37 was exploited in our static
ground-state calculations. The ground-state molecular geometries of
the studied molecules displayed in Figure 1 were optimized by the Becke, three-parameter,
Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP) functional38,39 with 6-31G(d,p) basis set.40 The solvation
effect was implemented using conductor-like polarizable continuum
model (C-PCM).41 Different solvents were
used to match with experimental conditions. The long alkyl chain of
the moiety of benzotriazole (BT) was replaced with a methyl group
to reduce the computing resource because the long alkyl chain has
less effect on the electronic structure of the backbone. The time-dependent
DFT (TD-DFT) was exploited for UV–vis spectra calculations.
To investigate the charge-transfer excitation properties, Coulomb-attenuating
method (CAM)42 was applied (at CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)
level) to calculate the UV–vis spectra of the studied molecules
based on the optimized geometries by B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) methods.

To model the photophysical properties of dye sensitizers adsorbed
on TiO2 thin films, a dye molecule adsorbed on a (TiO2)38 cluster was calculated. The geometries of the
(TiO2)38 cluster were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)
level. Deprotonated dyes are adsorbed on a (TiO2)38 supercluster43 with an anatase (101)
surface in a bidentate mode;44 one proton
is transferred to a nearby two-coordinated oxygen atom. The two oxygen
atoms of the carboxylate are bound to the two neighboring five-coordinated
Ti atoms on the (TiO2)38 cluster surface. The
geometries of dye–(TiO2)38 complexes
were optimized by the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method in the gas phase. All
of the atoms of the dye–(TiO2)38 complexes
are free for optimization. This model was used as a compromise between
computational resources and the stated purpose of predictions. The
UV–vis spectra of the optimized dye–(TiO2)38 complexes were performed at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)
level using acetonitrile as solvent (C-PCM model) within the Gaussian
09 program. The acetonitrile was chosen to match with experimental
conditions. The electron density difference maps (EDDMs), which indicate
the electron density before and after excitation, were generated using
GaussSum (version 3.0).

The TD-DFT nonadiabatic molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations of
free molecules were performed in terms of the Newton-X program45−48 (version 1.4.0-2) interfaced to Gaussian 09. The molecule we studied
was first optimized using the Gaussian 09 program.37 Thereafter, we calculated vibrational frequencies for the
studied molecule. The optimized structures and calculated frequencies
were used to generate the initial conditions. A 1 ps adiabatic ground-state
MD simulation (B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)) based on one of the initial conditions
was performed to reach thermal equilibrium prior to the excited-state
simulation (CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)). The simulation temperature was
controlled at 300 K through Andersen thermostat.49,50 The thermostat was applied every 1 fs. The simulation time step
was set to 0.5 fs. The final trajectory from the 1 ps adiabatic MD
simulation at S0 was used as the initial condition for
the following nonadiabatic MD simulations. We performed the nonadiabatic
MD simulations at the first singlet excited state (S1)
using time-derivative coupling method51 and fewest switching algorithm.52 The
method to compute the global phase was set to overlap the h vectors. And hopping from one state to another surface
was computed and is allowed at any time step. Butcher’s53 fifth-order method was used for the integration
of time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Nonconsecutive states
(e.g., S0 and S2) are all included in computing
the nonadiabatic coupling. The output trajectories were saved every
5 fs. To maintain the stability of the system, the job was terminated
when the energy difference between two neighboring steps or between
the current step and the initial step was higher than 0.5 eV.
