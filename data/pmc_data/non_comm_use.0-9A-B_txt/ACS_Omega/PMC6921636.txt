Sensitive detection of severe fever with thrombocytopenia
syndrome
virus (SFTSV) by a point-of-care assay is of great significance for
promoting clinical diagnosis. In this work, ultrasensitive detection
of SFTSV was achieved by using fluorescent carbon dots/SiO2 nanospheres (CSNs) as reporters for a lateral flow assay. The prepared
CSNs were resistant to extreme environments and had strong stability.
The uniform CSNs with the size of about 200 nm were obtained by differential
centrifugation. Their absolute quantum yields in the aqueous and solid
phases are 56.3 and 36.6%, respectively. The excellent fluorescent
properties of CSNs make the test strips more sensitive and have a
longer assay lifetime. Thus, the visual detection limit of the lateral
flow test strip based on immunofluorescent CSN (iCSN) was as low as
10 pg/mL SFTSV nucleoprotein. The sensitivity of this assay is 2 orders
of magnitude higher than that of the colloidal gold-based lateral
flow test strip. Besides, the assay owns good reproducibility and
high specificity. Then, iCSN-based lateral flow test strips were evaluated
in real samples of human serum of patients with satisfactory results.
Furthermore, this assay has a general prospect for other fluorescent
immunochromatography applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome
(SFTS) is an emerging
infectious disease with fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia as
the main clinical symptoms.1 Since 2010,
it has caused human infection and death in central and eastern China.
A novel Bunia virus, also known as SFTS virus (SFTSV), has been found
to be the cause of the disease. SFTSV is a single negative strand
RNA virus whose genome contains three RNA circular fragments of large
(L), medium (M), and small (S). The S fragment is an ambisense, encoding
a nucleoprotein (NP) and a nonstructural protein. NP can encapsulate
three RNA genomic fragments of SFTSV and play an important role in
viral transcription and replication.2 In
recent years, different SFTSV detection methods have been reported,3−5 for example, the ELISA detection of SFTSV has been reported, which
could detect an antigen concentration of 1 ng/mL. However, the lengthy
and cumbersome operations and expensive instruments limit their practical
application. In our previous work, colloidal gold-based lateral flow
assay was used for simple, convenient, and rapid detection of SFTSV
with a visual detection limit of 1 ng/mL SFTSV NP.6

As the most famous point-of-care (POC) assay strategy,
lateral
flow assay has been successfully utilized for detecting small molecules,7,8 nucleic acids,9 proteins,10,11 and so on. The main advantages of the lateral flow test strip are
speed, low cost, simplicity, convenience, and no need for trained
personnel and expensive equipment.11 The
lateral flow test strips labeled with gold nanoparticles have been
widely used and commercialized. This is due to their excellent stability,
incomparable biocompatibility, simpler synthesis, visual results,
and more. However, the inherent low signal-to-noise ratio of gold
nanoparticles limits their lower detection limit.12

Up to now, researchers have further developed lateral
flow test
strips using magnetic materials,13,14 carbon materials,15−17 fluorescent quantum dots (QDs),18,19 upconversion
phosphors,20,21 and organic fluorescent dyes22 as signal materials to improve sensitivity.
Among them, the integration of fluorescent QDs into nanospheres will
further improve the sensitivity, because the fluorescence intensity
of a fluorescent nanosphere is much higher than that of a single QD.
Furthermore, fluorescent nanospheres possess good biocompatibility,
high stability in a complex matrix, and convenient manipulation compared
with traditional semiconductor QDs.23 Over
the past decade, many researchers have worked on the construction
and application of semiconductor QDs-based fluorescence nanospheres
and have achieved a series of achievements.24−31 Different construction methods always have various limitations.23,32 For instance, after embedding high-quality oil QDs into nanospheres,
QDs may leak out of the sphere pores in nonpolar suspended media.
The incorporating of QDs during the nanosphere formation process usually
requires careful control of the reaction conditions, and QDs may aggregate
during the polymerization, which may affect their fluorescence properties.
The process of assembling QDs onto the surface of the nanospheres
is cumbersome and time-consuming, and it usually requires an additional
shell to cover the resulting fluorescent spheres for protection and
conjugation.

Most studies on carbon materials as signal reporters
for test strips
mainly include carbon colloids and carbon nanotubes, which can help
to visually observe the test results.15,16,33−35 They are more sensitive, stable,
and environmentally friendly than gold particles. Fluorescent carbon
dots (CDs) are a member of QDs and are a new class of zero-dimensional
nanomaterials in the carbon family. Compared with conventional semiconductor
QDs, fluorescent CDs are superior in terms of chemical inertness,
photostability, low cytotoxicity, and biocompatibility.36−38 Therefore, CDs can be widely used in biological imaging,38−42 drug release,43 as a sensor,44 photocatalyst,45 and
so on. Identically, the sensitivity of fluorescent carbon spheres
as the test strip signal should be higher than that of fluorescent
CDs as the test strip signal. To our best knowledge, there is no report
of the use of fluorescent CDs-based nanospheres as tags on the lateral
flow test strip.

In this paper, we reported a rapid and sensitive
method for the
detection of SFTSV based on immunofluorescent CDs/SiO2 nanospheres
(iCSNs) coupled with lateral flow test strips. The pathogen SFTSV
of SFTS syndrome was used as a model virus. The initial symptoms of
the SFTS syndrome are difficult to distinguish from viral infections
such as influenza. Amino-rich fluorescent CDs/SiO2 nanospheres
(CSNs) were synthesized by simple co-hydrolysis of silanized CDs with
tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). It has excellent fluorescence performance
and stability, and greatly improves the sensitivity of the test strip.
As expected, the detection limit of the assay was 10 pg/mL, which
is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the colloidal gold immunochromatography
assay, indicating that the iCSN-based test strip is promising in practice.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of the CSNs
CSNs were prepared by
co-hydrolysis of CDs and TEOS. The disadvantage of this method is
that the uniformity of the material is not good.46 In order to overcome the non-uniformity of CSNs, CSNs with
uniform morphology were obtained by differential centrifugation. Figure 1 illustrates transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of CSNs obtained by differential
centrifugation. It can be seen that the particles exhibit good dispersibility,
and as the separation speed increases from low to high, the size of
the particles obtained at each rotational speed is remarkably reduced.
The precipitate at 1500 rpm is mostly agglomerated particles as well
as larger particles. When the rotating speed increased to 2000 rpm,
there were still some agglomeration particles in the precipitate.
When the rotating speed is further increased to 2500 rpm, the precipitated
particle size is uniform and does not aggregate, and the average particle
size is 200 nm. In addition, there are many smaller particles in the
supernatant at 2500 rpm. The precipitate obtained at 2500 rpm was
used as the next research object. The image of high-resolution TEM
(HRTEM) in Figure 1E shows that CSNs own a mesoporous structure. CDs cannot be observed
directly by HRTEM. This can be attributed to the molecular-level chemical
dispersion of CD molecules in the silica matrix.47 The incorporation of CDs into the formation of SiO2 nanospheres does not affect the fluorescence properties of
CDs, and the strong fluorescence emitted by CSNs can be clearly visualized
under a confocal fluorescent microscope (Figure 1F). The absolute quantum yields of CSNs in
the aqueous phase and in the solid state are as high as 56.3 and 36.6%,
respectively. Compared with the quantum yield of CDs of 47%,39 the quantum yield of CSNs in the aqueous phase
is higher. This indicates that the obtained CSNs have good stability
and can be applied in harsh environments such as strong acids.

rpm (D). HRTEM (E) and confocal fluorescent image (F) of the precipitate

As demonstrated in Figure 2, the intense blue light of the CD aqueous
solution, the CSN
aqueous solution, and the CSN powder can be observed under a 360 nm
ultraviolet (UV) lamp. When excited in the range of 360–400
nm, the CD aqueous solution, the CSN aqueous solution, and the CSN
powder exhibit strong blue photoluminescence (PL) centered at approximately
460 nm. When the excitation wavenumber is further increased, the emission
of the CDs shifts from 465 to 524 nm and accompanied by a remarkable
decrease in PL intensity, whereas the PL center of the CSN aqueous
solution and the CSN powder does not move significantly; there is
only a significant decrease in PL intensity. The PL centers of the
CD aqueous solution, the CSN aqueous solution, and the CSN powder
excited at 360 nm are 459, 462, and 463 nm, respectively. The optimum
excitation wavelengths of the CD aqueous solution, the CSN aqueous
solution, and the CSN powder are 369, 377, and 384 nm, respectively
(Figure 2D). The red
shift of the CSN aqueous solution relative to the CD aqueous solution
is due to the increase in the rigidity of the CDs caused by CDs embedded
in the rigid support of silica,47 enhanced
molecular structure rigidity, increased coplanarity, and enhanced
emission.48,49 The aggregation of CDs caused by solvent
volatilization leads to further red shift of the CSN powder.50 Energy resonance transfer or direct π–π
interaction occurs because of the decrease of distance between adjacent
CDs, which leads to the decrease of fluorescence efficiency.51 In addition, N-β-(aminoethyl)-γ-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane
(AEAPTMS), as a long-chain ligand, has a strong steric hindrance effect,
and the CDs are embedded in the silica matrix, which makes the CDs
support each other in the solid state and weakening the agglomeration
effect, so the solid CSNs have fluorescence properties.

Fabrication of an iCSN-Based Lateral Flow Test Strip
To explore the feasibility of CSNs in sensitive fluorescence detection,
CSNs were applied as optical labels on the lateral flow test strip.
The first was to conjugate CSNs with the antibody. The composition
of the CD is calculated by theory (Supporting Information, S4), which contains a large number of AEAPTMS.
In the synthesis of CSNs, AEAPTMS participated in the reaction, so
the CSNs are rich in amino groups. Although the glutaraldehyde method
can directly bind the amino-rich CSNs to the antibody to form a complex,
in the coupling process, agglomeration easily occurs among antibodies,
antibodies and CSNs, and CSNs. Therefore, the particle size of the
CSNs is greatly increased to the micron level, which is not suitable
for immunochromatography (Figure S3A).
This work was carried out by the succinic anhydride method, that is,
the amino groups of CSNs were first reacted with succinic anhydride
to form succinic acid half esters, which were then catalyzed by carbodiimide
to form amide bonds with antibody (Figure 3A). The zeta potential of CDs/SiO2 spheres altered successively from the 23.5 to −37.8 mV (Figure 3B), indicating that
the surface of the CSNs is rich in amino groups and then successfully
grafted with the carboxyl groups. The CSNs were then modified with
SFTSV monoclonal antibody (SmAb) and further blocked with bovine serum
albumin (BSA) to form iCSNs as reporters, resulting in a partially
neutralized zeta potential (−16.6 mV).

Figure 3 (A) Schematic illustration
of the surface functionalization of
the CSNs for lateral flow immunoassay. (B) Zeta potential of the CSNs
at different stages of surface functionalization corresponding to
panel (A).

As shown in Figure 4A, the pretreated sample pad, the nitrocellulose (NC)
membrane, and
the absorbent pad were adhered to the black plastic adhesive card
to form a lateral flow test strip. The test (T) and control (C) lines
of the NC membrane were coated with SmAb and goat antimouse IgG antibody,
respectively. Figure 4B shows a schematic diagram of the SFTSV detection. The immunocomplex
was formed by mixing the iCSNs with the sample and the mixture was
then loaded into the sample pad to begin the test. The mixture was
absorbed and migrated along the strip by capillary force. Through
the interaction of specific antigen and antibody, the immunocomplex
was captured by the T line on NC membrane to form the iCSN/SFTSV NP/SmAb
sandwich structure. As the liquid continued to migrate, the free iCSNs
moved further and were trapped by the goat antimouse IgG antibody
on the C line to form the iCSN/IgG structure. Because of the strong
PL performance of CSNs, signals could be observed under a UV lamp.
If there is no SFTSV NP in the sample, iCSNs will flow through the
T line instead of accumulating on the T line, only interacting with
the goat antimouse IgG antibody on the C line. The determination of
the results is illustrated in Figure 5A. The sample is considered positive when two fluorescence
lines appeared on the T and C lines, and negative when only the C
line is seen. An invalid test is the one with only a T line or no
lines. Figure 5B shows
a picture of positive and negative results. For a positive result,
the T and C lines show blue light under a UV lamp. For a negative
result, only the C line shows blue light under a UV lamp.

Performance of the iCSN-Based Lateral Flow Test Strip
Sample pads were preimmersed in a buffer containing NaCl to eliminate
false-positives before testing (Figure S3B). The possible reason is that secondary amines on CSNs and negatively
charged amino acids on proteins may adsorb nonspecifically by electrostatic
interactions. The salt dissociates into a positively charged and a
negatively charged ionic state in water, which shields the protein
from solid carriers and reduces nonspecific adsorption.52,53 Under optimized detection condition, the sensitivity of the iCSN-based
lateral flow test strip assay was investigated. First, a series of
60 μL SFTSV NP standards (1 μg/mL, 100 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL;
1 ng/mL, 100 pg/mL, 10 pg/mL, 0 pg/mL) were mixed with 10 μL
of iCSN dispersion in a 0.5 mL centrifuge tube, respectively. The
mixtures were then loaded separately onto the sample pads of the lateral
flow test strips. As shown in Figure 6A, the blue C lines demonstrate the validity of the
test results. The brightness of the T line decreases as the concentration
of SFTSV NPs decreases. From 1 μg/mL to 1 ng/mL, the T lines
emits very bright blue light, indicating positive results immediately.
The colors of T lines are hard to be distinguished under low concentrations.
In addition, only the C line is observed in the absence of SFTSV NP.
Here, the visual detection limit for detecting SFTSV NPs is 10 pg/mL.
The extremely low detection limit of the lateral flow test strip based
on CSNs can be attributed to the excellent fluorescence characteristics
of CSNs. This test can be quantified by estimating the brightness
of the T line. As shown in Figure 6B, a linear relationship is obtained in a wide range
of 10 pg/mL to 1 μg/mL with a linear correlation coefficient
(R2) of 0.998. Compared to the previous
SFTSV detection methods (Table S1), our
method utilizes the novel cost-effective materials, saves time, and
has a decent performance at the same time. This suggests that the
iCSN-based lateral flow test strips have very promising prospects
for high-sensitivity POC detection of viruses.

linear response for SFTSV NP detection; concentration range of 10

To confirm the selectivity of the current immunoassay,
blank phosphate
buffer solution (PBS) and five different antigens with a concentration
of 1 μg/mL were examined on the strip individually. The five
antigens were HCG, AFP, CEA, CA125, and SFTSV NP. As shown in Figure 7, only the T line
of the SFTSV NP shows obvious color. Accordingly, the fluorescence
intensity for the SFTSV NP sample is conspicuously higher than that
for those nonspecific protein samples. These results mean that the
iCSN-based lateral flow test strip can specifically detect SFTSV.

To evaluate the precision and reproducibility of
the iCSN-based
test strip, the intra-assay and interassay were performed using 1
μg/mL, 10 ng/mL, and 100 pg/mL SFTSV NP standard samples. The
intra-assay CV and inter-assay CV are 4.8 and 7.1% (Table 1), respectively, demonstrating
that the method has high reproducibility and good precision. The strong
stability of CSNs keeps its fluorescence intensity constant as the
storage time increases, and even after 6 months of storage, iCSN retains
its biological activity when used in test strips (Figure 8).

Detection of SFTSV in Human Serums
To evaluate the
application of the iCSN-based lateral flow test strip in clinical
diagnosis, the immunoassay was extended to the clinical diagnosis
of SFTSV in serum as in our previous work.6 The results of the real-samples analysis (Figure 9) are consistent with the results of the
polymerase chain reaction and the colloidal gold immunochromatographic
test (Table 2), indicating
that the iCSN-based lateral flow assay of human samples is reliable.
Therefore, these results indicated that the iCSN-based lateral flow
assay platform may bring a tremendous infusion of promise to the rapid
detection of SFTSV in the early stages of the SFTS syndrome.

mL of peripheral blood from volunteers in the First People’s
Hospital of Jiangsu Province, and only applied for scientific research.
All protocols involving human subjects were reviewed and approved
by the Ethical Committee of the Southeast University in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki (Association, 2000). Informed consent

Conclusions
In summary, fluorescent CSNs were prepared
by co-hydrolysis of
silanized CDs and TEOS using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)
as a template, and uniform size CSNs were obtained by differential
centrifugation. Compared with other fluorescent nanospheres, CSNs
synchronously fulfill several criteria: homogeneously distributed
CDs within SiO2 templates, uniform dimensions for good
reproducibility, convenient surface derivations, relatively simple
preparation process, low cost, and environmental friendliness. In
addition, it undergoes a strong acid and alkali environment during
the synthesis process, but still has a strong quantum yield. The high
absolute quantum yields of the CSNs in the aqueous phase and the solid
phase make the test strip more sensitive and have a longer assay lifetime.
The detection limit of the iCSN-based lateral flow test strip for
SFTSV NPs was as low as 10 pg/mL. This is 2 orders of magnitude lower
than the SFTSV NPs detected by the test strip of gold colloid as a
signal. The assay exhibited a fast, sensitive, and highly selective
response to the SFTSV and was applied to the detection of real samples.
This assay opens up a new possibility for POC SFTSV detection in daily
life. With the continuous expansion of future research, the detection
principle can be extended to other virus, protein biomarkers, nucleic
acids, and bacteria in clinical diagnosis and a variety of other biomedical
applications, which have a wider clinical application prospect.

Data of serum detection using the PCR method were provided by Jiangsu
Province Hospital. In addition, other apparatus are shown in the Supporting Information.

Fabrication of CSNs
At first, silanized CDs were synthesized
according to the previous report with slight modifications.39,46 The specific procedure was as follows: 15 mL of AEAPTMS was poured
into a 50 mL three-necked flask and purged with nitrogen for 15 min.
The solution was then heated to 240 °C, and 1 g of dehydrated
citric acid (pretreatment of citric acid monohydrate in an 80 °C
vacuum oven overnight) was quickly added with vigorous stirring. After
5 min, the heating was stopped and the solution was naturally cooled.
The obtained CD solution was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for
10 min to remove large particles at the bottom.

Then, CSNs were
prepared by the co-hydrolysis method according to the previous report
with modification.39 In brief, CTAB (0.2
g) and NaOH (0.15 mL, 10 M) were added into 99 mL of H2O and stirred at 80 °C for 1 h. A mixture of TEOS (1.2 mL) and
CD (0.35 mL) was quickly poured into the solution and allowed to stir
at 80 °C for 3 h. The mixture was diluted with ethanol and collected
by centrifugation. The precipitate was dispersed in a mixture of HCl
(15 mL) and ethanol (120 mL) and stirred at 60 °C for 6 h to
extract the residue organic template. The extraction was repeated
once and the product was washed to neutral, and finally the aminoterminated
CSNs were dispersed in ethanol.

Uniform-sized CSNs were obtained
by differential centrifugation,
that is, by gradually increasing the rotating speed from low to high.
First, the CSNs with the largest size were separated from the solution
at low speed, and then the liquid was poured into another centrifugal
tube to increase the rotating speed and separate the CSNs in second
order. With gradually increased rotating speed and repeating the above
process, CSNs of size from large to small were obtained from the precipitation
of each rotating speed. In order to improve the separation accuracy,
the precipitation obtained at each rotating speed was dispersed and
centrifuged several times under the same centrifugal conditions (the
same speed and time), so that the small particles in the precipitation
were gradually removed from the liquid through multiple dispersion,
whereas the large particles were always retained in the precipitation.
In the specific experimental process, the rotating speeds were 1000,
1500, 2000, 2500 rpm, respectively, the time was 15 min, and the solvent
was ethanol. The bottom precipitate at 1000 rpm was discarded and
the bottom precipitate at 1500, 2000 and 2500 rpm and the supernatant
at 2500 rpm were separately studied.

Fabrication of CSNs–Antibody Conjugates
CSNs
obtained at 2500 rpm were used as labels and conjugated to the SmAb.
The aminoterminated CSNs were centrifuged and dispersed in DMF at
a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Then, CSNs were carboxylated by adding
succinic anhydride (5 mg/mL) and stirring for 4 h. The carboxyl-terminated
CSNs were washed with ethanol and H2O several times and
dispersed in MES buffer (0.01 M, pH = 6.0) for further use. The carboxyl-terminated
CSNs were functionalized with SmAb through classical carbodiimide
coupling reaction. In brief, 1 mL of CDs/SiO2 spheres (1
mg/mL) in MES buffer (0.01 M, pH = 6.0) was first activated by adding
EDC (4 mg) and NHS (6 mg) and reacted for 15 min. The activated particles
were washed with water and redispersed in 0.5 mL of HEPES buffer (0.01
M, pH = 7.4). Then, 0.5 mL of SmAb at a concentration of 150 μg/mL
was added and incubated at 25 °C for 2 h with gentle agitation.
The SmAb-labeled CDs/SiO2, that is, iCSNs were harvested
by centrifugation, and redispersed in 1 mL of HEPES buffer (0.01 M,
pH = 7.4, containing 1% BSA) to form the storage dispersion and kept
at 4 °C.

Lateral Flow Test Strip Preparation
The lateral flow
test strip consists of a sample pad (8 × 3 mm), an NC membrane
(25 × 3 mm), an absorbent pad (21 × 4 mm), and a black plastic
adhesive card. Sample pads were soaked in the treatment solution,
which was composed of PBS (10 mM, pH = 7.4) containing 1% (v/v) Tirton
X-100 and 2% NaCl, and then dried at 37 °C for 2 h. SmAb (2 mg/mL)
and goat antimouse IgG antibody (2 mg/mL) were separately dispersed
on the T and C lines of the NC membrane using a double-headed marker
(SJ001, Shenzhen Stationery Store) with an extremely small nib (SJ002,
1.97 × 34 mm, Shenzhen Stationery Store) and drying at 37 °C
for 2 h. The interval between two lines was 5 mm. The sample pad,
NC membrane, and absorbent pad were assembled on the black plastic
adhesive card and cut into 3 mm strips. Finally, the strips were kept
in an aseptic bag of 4 °C until used.

Detection of SFTSV Using iCSN-Based Lateral Flow Test Strip
The sample (60 μL of SFTSV NP standard solution or serum
sample) was mixed with 10 μL of iCSNs in a 0.5 mL centrifuge
tube. Then, the mixture was loaded onto the sample pad of the lateral
flow test strip, allowing all liquid to be absorbed and migrated along
the strip. After 15 min, the results were visually observed under
a 360 nm UV lamp in the dry state of the test strip and photographed
using an Apple cell phone camera. The images were then digitally processed
using ImageJ software to detect the intensity of the T lines in the
test strips. The NC film emits blue light under the UV lamp, and the
measurement of the light intensity of the T lines subtracted the light
intensity of the NC film itself.
