Fluorinated
electrolytes based on fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)
have been considered as promising alternative electrolytes for high-voltage
and high-energy capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the
compatibility of the fluorinated electrolytes with graphite negative
electrodes is unclear. In this paper, we have systematically investigated,
for the first time, the stability of fluorinated electrolytes with
graphite negative electrodes, and the result shows that unlike the
ethylene carbonate (EC)-based electrolyte, the FEC-based electrolyte
(EC was totally replaced by FEC) is incapable of forming a protective
and effective solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that protects the
electrolyte from runaway reduction on the graphite surface. The reason
is that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels are
also lowered by the introduction of fluorine into the solvent, and
the FEC solvent has poorer resistance against reduction, leading to
instability on the graphite negative electrode. To tackle this problem,
two lithium salts of lithium bis(oxalato)borate and lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate
(LiDFOB) have been investigated as negative-electrode film-forming
additives. Incorporation of only 0.5 wt % LiDFOB to a FEC-based electrolyte
[1.0 M LiPF6 in 3:7 (FEC–ethyl methyl carbonate)]
results in excellent cycling performance of the graphite negative
electrode. This improved property originates from the generation of
a thinner and better quality SEI film with little LiF by the sacrificial
reduction of the LiDFOB additive on the graphite negative electrode
surface. On the other hand, this additive can stabilize the electrolyte
by scavenging HF. Meanwhile, the incorporated LiDFOB additive has
positive influence on the interphase layer on the positive electrode
surface and significantly decreases the amount of HF formation, finally
leading to improved cycling stability and rate capability of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 electrodes at a high cutoff
voltage of 5 V. The data demonstrate that the LiDFOB additive not
only exhibits a superior compatibility with graphite but also improves
the electrochemical properties of high-voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 positive electrodes considerably, confirming
its potential as a prospective, multifunctional additive for 5 V fluorinated
electrolytes in high-energy capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

1 Introduction
Developing
a new generation of 5 V-class nonaqueous electrolytes
with high cathodic/anodic stability and compatibility is of great
technological importance for high-voltage and high-energy capacity
lithium-ion batteries.1,2 In this technology development,
various novel electrolyte solvents and additives have been widely
explored in the past decades,3−9 and among them, fluorinated solvents have attracted particular attention
because of their high oxidation stability, low melting point, and
high flash point.10−17 Some partially fluorinated carbonates were reported by Zhang et
al.,16 who used them and a highly fluorinated
ether as cosolvents and formulated fluorinated electrolytes for the
5 V-class chemistry. The results found that these fluorinated electrolytes
had high resistance against oxidation, and full lithium-ion cells
of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li4Ti5O12 that assembled these electrolytes showed significantly
improved cycling stability. Recently, Markevich et al.17 investigated the use fluoroethylene carbonate
(FEC) as a cosolvent instead of the most commonly used ethylene carbonate
(EC) in LiCoPO4/Li, LiCoPO4/Si, and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Si cells; the cells using
the FEC-based electrolyte exhibited better capacity retention compared
with the cells containing the EC-based electrolyte. The oxidation
stability of the FEC-based electrolyte was further confirmed by Hu
et al.13,15 It is well-known that fluorine substitution
in organic solvents lowers the highest occupied molecular orbital
energy levels, resulting in higher oxidation stability. In the abovementioned
reports, the fluorinated electrolytes based on fluorinated solvents
indicate excellent voltage stability on the high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and LiCoPO4 positive
electrode. However, because the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
energy levels are also lowered by the introduction of fluorine into
the solvent, the fluorinated electrolytes have poorer resistance against
reduction, leading to instability on graphite negative electrodes.16,18 In Shen et al.’s work,19 they
reported the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on highly ordered
pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) in two electrolytes using in situ atomic
force microscopy (AFM) techniques and found that the SEI layer formed
by a FEC/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)-based electrolyte was thick and
dense compared to the SEI layer formed by a EC/DMC-based electrolyte.
Unfortunately, the electrochemical stability of graphite negative
electrodes in FEC-based electrolytes has not been reported.

In our previous works, we found that the F-electrolyte containing
a new fluorinated ether, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether
(HFPM), as a cosolvent has good compatibility with graphite negative
electrodes.20 The reason is that HFPM has
a high reduction potential around 1.2 V, which is beneficial for forming
an effective SEI on the graphite negative electrode surface, resulting
in enhanced stability on the negative side of high-voltage mesocarbon
microbead (MCMB)/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 18 650
batteries. However, the fluorinated ether HFPM has an extremely low
boiling point (50 °C) slightly above room temperature, and its
boiling point is not acceptable.21,22 Moreover,
it has a high cost in manufacturing and purification. Thus, the HFPM
is not suitable as a cosolvent for high-voltage electrolytes in practice.

On the other hand, electrolyte functional additives have been developed
to promote the formation of a protective SEI film on graphitic materials.23−27 In general, these additives are often consumed and intended for
the formation of the SEI film in the initial cycles of the battery.
For instance, propylene carbonate (PC) can easily reduce on graphite
and co-insert with a Li ion into the interlayer structure of graphite
negative electrodes, resulting in the destruction of the inner layer
of graphite negative electrodes. To solve this problem, many film-forming
additives including ethylene sulfite and vinyl sulfones have been
reported.25,28−30 Prior to the electrochemical
reduction of the electrolyte solvents, these additives are preferably
reduced to facilitate the formation of an effective SEI on the graphite
surface, which successfully prevents the cointercalation of PC molecules
into graphite. In the case of the FEC-based electrolyte, the reduction
of FEC starts at ca. 1.5 V versus Li+/Li.19,26 If functional additives in the electrolyte are reduced prior to
this potential and are capable of forming a protective and conductive
SEI, they will prevent continuous reductive decomposition, leading
to an improved performance of the battery. Some prevalent lithium
salts, such as lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB)31 and lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB),32 greatly improve the SEI durability on graphite
negative electrodes. Moreover, we found that these lithium salt additives
can be reduced at ca. ∼1.6 V and form a robust protective SEI
film on the graphite surface with very low interfacial impedance.
For this reason, in this paper, we introduced LiBOB and LiDFOB as
film-forming additives in the FEC-based high-voltage electrolyte to
alleviate its compatibility with graphite negative electrodes, discussed
a systematic investigation of the influence of these additives on
the performance of high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 positive electrodes, and finally proposed an improved
mechanism of the additives on the carbon negative surface.

2 Results and Discussion
We all know that graphite-based
negative electrodes, because of
its low delithiation/lithiation potentials (<0.3 V vs Li+/Li), high energy capacity, and low cost, are widely used in commercial
lithium-ion batteries. The FEC-based electrolytes show excellent cycling
stability on the high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and LiCoPO4 positive electrodes. However, the
electrochemical stability of graphite negative electrodes in FEC-based
high-voltage electrolytes has not been reported. To clarify the electrochemical
compatibility of the FEC-based high-voltage electrolyte with graphite
negative electrodes, we examined the discharge–charge properties
of Li/MCMB coin cells in these electrolytes by galvanostatic testing.
The FEC-based electrolytes assembled were as follows: 1 M LiPF6/FEC and 1 M LiPF6/FEC–ethyl methyl carbonate
(EMC) (5:5 or 4:6 or 3:7, by vol). All electrodes were cycled between
0 and 2 V at 50 mA g–1. From Figure 1, it can be clearly seen that the Li/MCMB
cells in the 1 M LiPF6/FEC electrolyte are hardly discharged
with the discharging voltage suddenly down to the lower limit of 0
V or charged with the charging voltage steeply up to the upper limit
of 2 V, showing a negligible capacity of ∼0 mAh g–1. The result clearly indicates the incompatibility of the 1 M LiPF6/FEC electrolyte solution with graphite. To clarify the reason
for the incompatibility of the 1 M LiPF6/FEC electrolyte
solution with graphite, we tested some experiments about the electrolyte
1 M LiPF6/FEC. First, we tested the ionic conductivity
of the electrolytes at 25 °C. As shown in Table S1, the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte 1 M LiPF6/FEC at room temperature still can reach 4.26 mS cm–1, which is lower than that of the electrolyte 1 M LiPF6/FEC + EMC (3/7, v/v) of ∼8.88 mS cm–1.
This result displayed that the little high viscosity of the electrolyte
1 M LiPF6/FEC still had a good conductivity. Second, to
further eliminate the influence of the little high viscosity of the
1 M LiPF6/FEC solution, we also tested the discharge–charge
curves of Li/MCMB half coin cells in the electrolyte 1 M LiPF6/FEC at very low currents of 20 and 5 μA. Meanwhile,
to ensure the reproducibility of the result, we assembled three coin
cells at a time and simultaneously tested their discharge–charge
performance under the same condition. From Figure S1, we found that the discharge and charge curves of Li/MCMB
cells in the 1 M LiPF6/FEC electrolyte at a current of
20 μA were very poor. When the current was 5 μA, in the
first case, there was a long plateau at about 0.2 V, and the cell
was always discharged. As a result, no charge capacity can be obtained.
The main reason seems to be that the stable SEI film in the FEC-based
electrolyte was not well-formed in the first cycle. Additionally, Figure S2 showed the Li plating and stripping
behavior in the electrolyte 1 M LiPF6/FEC, which is in
good agreement with the result reported from the literature.34 Corroborating the conductivity, discharge–charge,
and cyclic voltammetry (CV) results, we inferred that FEC cannot form
a stable SEI film on the graphite surface, which leads to a bad cycling
performance of the graphite in the 1 M LiPF6/FEC electrolyte.

Figure 1 (a) Galvanostatic
charge–discharge profiles of the Li/MCMB
half cells between 0 and 2 V at 50 mA g–1 in the
FEC-based electrolytes. (b) Cycling behaviors of the Li/MCMB half
cells assembling the FEC-based electrolytes containing various volume
ratios of FEC and EMC.

However, when the EMC cosolvent is added to the electrolytes,
the
cell assembling the electrolyte 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC
(5:5 or 4:6 or 3:7, by vol) exhibits a relatively high reversible
capacity of ∼310 mA h g–1 at first cycle
but its capacity slowly falls down to 270 mA h g–1 in the subsequent 10 cycles, suggesting that although the EMC cosolvent
improves the cycling performance of the cell in the FEC-based electrolytes,
the MCMB electrode also exhibits an instability in the cycling performance
in the FEC-based electrolyte. The galvanostatic discharge–charge
curves for different cycles shown in Figure 1a further confirm the incompatibility of
this electrolyte with graphite negative electrodes, which may be attributed
to the fact that FEC has higher reduction potential compared to its
nonfluorinated counterpart EC. Moreover, these results demonstrate
that the FEC-based electrolyte is incapable of forming an effective
SEI on the MCMB negative electrode surface. This conclusion is in
accordance with recently reported results.19 In Shen et al.’s work,19 they
studied the SEI layer on HOPG in EC- and FEC-based electrolytes using
in situ AFM techniques and found that the SEI layer formed by the
FEC/DMC-based electrolyte was thick and dense compared to that formed
by the EC/DMC-based electrolyte.

To improve the stability of
the SEI film, two film-forming additives
such as LiBOB and LiDFOB were introduced into the FEC-based electrolyte.
In this work, we select the 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7,
v/v) electrolyte as a studied FEC-based electrolyte. Furthermore,
it is of importance to study the stability with lithium metal in the
electrolyte because the properties of the lithiated MCMB are similar
to those of lithium metal. Thus, it is meaningful to test the compatibilities
of lithium metal with the FEC-based electrolytes. Figure 2 shows two photographs of the
FEC-based electrolytes without and with a Li sheet after being stored
for 10 days (a) and 6 months (b) at 25 °C. The FEC-based electrolyte
solutions are as follows: (1) 1 M LiPF6/FEC, (2) 1 M LiPF6/FEC + Li sheet, (3) 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7,
v/v), (4) 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7, v/v) + Li sheet,
(5) 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7, v/v)-1 wt % LiBOB, (6)
1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7, v/v)-1 wt % LiBOB + Li sheet,
(7) 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7, v/v)-0.5 wt % LiBOB
+ Li sheet, (8) 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7, v/v)-1 wt
% LiDFOB + Li sheet, and (9) 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7,
v/v)-0.5 wt % LiDFOB + Li sheet. As shown in Figure 2a, after being stored in an Ar glovebox for
10 days, the color of the electrolytes (1) and (2) (1 M LiPF6/FEC without/with a Li sheet) turns black. We think that the color
change of the electrolyte (1) may be due to the traces of water, moisture,
and alcohol resulting in the formation of hydrofluoric acid HF, which
correspondingly leads to a severe deterioration of the electrolyte
(1). Meanwhile, the color change of the electrolyte (2) may also be
attributed to the reduction decomposition of FEC (reaction 1)35 to the reaction products
dissolved in the electrolyte. This result follows the conclusions
reached in the previous studies.35,36 1  

Figure 2 Photographs of the FEC-based electrolytes (1) 1 M LiPF6/FEC, (2) 1 M
LiPF6/FEC + Li sheet, (3) 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC
(3:7, v/v), (4) 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7, v/v) + Li

% LiBOB + Li sheet, (8) 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7,

(3:7, v/v)-0.5 wt % LiDFOB + Li sheet after being stored for 10 days
(a) and 6 months (b) in the Ar-filled glovebox at 25 °C.

By contrast, when either the Li
sheet or the LiBOB additive is
added in the 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7) electrolyte
solution, the color of the electrolytes (4–6) is still clear,
suggesting that the Li sheet and LiBOB can stabilize the FEC-based
electrolyte during this short time, which may be attributed to the
suppression of HF generation.37 However,
after 6 months, it can clearly be seen from Figure 2b that the electrolytes having no additive
(4) and LiBOB (6, 7) shows a color change from dark brown to light
brown, respectively. By contrast, the color of the electrolytes containing
the LiDFOB additives (8, 9) is nearly unchanged after standing for
6 months, illustrating that merely 0.5 wt % LiDFOB-contained FEC-based
electrolyte is stable toward lithium metal. According to the results
of previous studies, the reduction potential of LiDFOB molecules is
slightly higher than that of LiBOB molecules, indicating that LiDFOB
will be prone to be reduced at the Li metal surface first.32 The reduction of the LiDFOB additive
results in the formation of more complicated and stable oligomers
to yield a passivating SEI film on the Li metal surface. Therefore,
LiDFOB could be used as a film-forming additive for the FEC-based
electrolyte.

To examine the anodic behavior of the FEC-based
electrolytes 1
M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7, v/v) without and with the
LiDFOB additive, the initial linear sweep voltammogram curves of these
electrolytes using a Pt microelectrode at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1, together with those of the electrolyte 1 M LiPF6/FEC for comparison, are shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S3, the anodic current of the electrolyte 1 M LiPF6/FEC starts to rise from 2.7 V versus Li+/Li and becomes
huge at ca. 2.0 V, which is in agreement with the earlier data.26 This result indicates that FEC is prone to be
reduced at a higher potential. By contrast, in the first negative
scan of the electrolyte 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7,
v/v), the huge reduction peaks at ca. 2.0 V disappear and then two
weak reduction peaks emerge at 1.5 and 0.7 V, which are related to
the reductive decomposition of FEC and EMC, respectively.20 As for the electrolyte containing the LiDFOB
additive, a new reductive peak arises at a potential of 2.5 V, which
may be ascribed to the electrochemical reduction of LiDFOB molecules.
To evidence the electrochemical compatibility of the FEC-based electrolyte
containing the LiDFOB additive with the graphite negative electrode,
the CV measurements of Li/MCMB coin cells using the electrolytes at
a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 are shown in Figure 3. As shown in the
inset of Figure 3,
in the first cycle, the MCMB negative electrode in the electrolyte
with no additive displays two weak reduction peaks at 1.5 and 0.7
V, which are attributed to the decomposition of FEC and EMC, respectively.
By contrast, the CV curve of the Li/MCMB cell using the electrolyte
containing 0.5 wt % LiDFOB shows a strong reductive peak at around
1.6 V, which is believed to be the result of the reduction and polymerization
of LiDFOB molecules.32,38 In addition, the peak positioned
at 0.7 V disappears, indicating that the SEI film originating from
the FEC-based electrolyte with the LiDFOB additive can inhibit the
reduction of EMC. As shown in Figure 3, there is one main anodic/cathodic peak due to the
reversible lithium insertion/extraction reactions with the active
graphite negative electrode at a low potential region of 0.5–0.01
V, which is in good agreement with the previous reports.39,40 Moreover, we can see from Figure 3 that in the subsequent cycles, there was no obvious
peak displacement, suggesting that the FEC-based electrolyte containing
0.5 wt % LiDFOB shows a good electrochemical compatibility with the
graphite negative electrode. These CV features also suggest that LiDFOB
is capable of forming a stable SEI on the graphite negative electrode
surface to enhance the compatibility of the FEC-based electrolyte
with graphite.

Figure 3 Typical CV curves of Li/MCMB half coin cells in the electrolyte
containing 0.5 wt % LiDFOB additive. The initial CV curves of the
Li/MCMB half coin cells in the FEC-based electrolyte without and with
the LiDFOB additive are expressed in the inset (scan rate: 0.1 mV
s–1).

The discharge–charge performance of the Li/MCMB cells
with
the FEC-based electrolyte containing 0.5 wt % LiDFOB additive is shown
in Figure 4. All electrodes
were cycled at 50 mA g–1 in the first five cycles
and at 100 mA g–1 for the later cycles and a cutoff
voltage of 2.0–0 V. Note that the MCMB negative electrode exhibits
a high charge capacity of 373 mAh g–1 and a slightly
low Coulombic efficiency of 82.1% in the initial cycle, which is lower
than that without the LiDFOB electrolyte (86.5%). This may be due
to the SEI layer formation produced by the LiDFOB reductive decomposition
on the MCMB negative electrode as shown below. After 90 cycles, the
cell can still reach 362 mAh g–1, corresponding
to the capacity retention of 99.2% with respect to its sixth cycle
at the same current density. At the same time, the Coulombic efficiency
during cycling remains relatively stable (at >99%) in the 0.5 wt
%
LiDFOB electrolytes. Besides, the galvanostatic discharge–charge
curves for different cycles shown in the inset of Figure 4 further confirm an excellent
cycling performance of the MCMB electrode in 0.5 wt % LiDFOB electrolytes.
These data suggest that the introduction of 0.5 wt % LiDFOB in the
FEC-based electrolyte can obviously enhance the cycling stability
of the MCMB electrode.

efficiency
vs cycle number obtained upon galvanostatic cycling for Li/MCMB coin
cells in the FEC-based electrolyte containing 0.5 wt % LiDFOB additive.
The inset of this figure displays the discharge–charge curves
of the electrode in this electrolyte.

Different evolutions of the SEI film formed on the MCMB negative
electrode in the FEC-based electrolyte without and with the LiDFOB
additive have been discussed below by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). It is generally known that the first discharge
data directly display
the formation of the SEI film by reductive decomposition of the electrolytes.
Therefore, the first discharge profile of Li/MCMB half coin cells
discharged to different cutoff voltages in these two electrolytes
at a constant low current of 5 μA is shown in Figure 5a. As seen from Figure 5a, a plateau in a slope potential
range of ca. 1.5 V versus Li+/Li attributed to the reduction
of the FEC solvent was observed for the cell using the FEC-based electrolyte
without an additive. However, a new plateau emerged at about 1.7 V
versus Li+/Li for the cell with the LiDFOB additive, which
is in accordance with the CV results in Figure 3. This plateau is ascribed to the reduction
and polymerization of LiDFOB on the surface of the MCMB negative electrode,
which results in the formation of a stable SEI on the graphite negative
electrode. SEM images of MCMB surface after first discharged to 1.8,
1.3, and 0.5 V with these two electrolytes are presented in Figure
S4 (Supporting Information). It can be
seen from Figure S4 that when
the discharged cutoff voltage was decreased successively from 1.8
to 1.3 V and further to 0.5 V, in the absence of the additive, features
of pristine MCMB particles turn unclear and are difficult to be recognized,
which may be due to the thick SEI film. However, in the presence of
the LiDFOB additive, the surface of the graphite negative electrode
is quite clean and the MCMB particles can be easily seen. This suggests
that the SEI films formed on the negative electrode
with the LiDFOB electrolyte in the initial cycle are thin. Moreover,
we found that the surface of the negative electrode with no additive
showed some white particles with low conductivity, and we speculated
that these white particles might be LiF compounds, which is consistent
with some experimental results and theoretical predictions in the
presence of FEC.35,41,42 To further confirm them, the elemental concentrations of the graphite
negative electrode discharged to 0.5 V in no-additive electrolyte
1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7, v/v) are provided in Figure 5b. The EDXS analysis
shows that the concentration of the F element in the α location
with more white particles is 75.6%, which is much larger than that
in the β (or γ) location with no white particles, inferring
that these white particles are LiF. Many LiF compounds are observed
on the negative electrode surface cycled in the electrolyte without
an additive, whereas the surface cycled in the LiDFOB electrolyte
has not many LiF particles. The difference may be ascribed to the
role of the LiDFOB additive forming a robust SEI on the negative electrode
surface. On the other hand, LiDFOB can also sequester PF5 to significantly decrease the amount of HF formation.37,43,44 HF severely consumes Li ions
to form LiF deposited on the surface of the negative electrode.

discharged to 0.5 V in no-additive electrolyte 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC (3:7, v/v). The inset of (b) shows the element composition
detected by EDXS. The red squares indicate the locations probed by
EDXS.

The positive impact of the LiDFOB
additive on the surface chemistry
of the graphite negative electrode is confirmed by a comparison of
the XPS spectra obtained from MCMB negative electrodes discharged
to different cutoff voltages in the electrolytes 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC without and with the LiDFOB additive, as displayed
in Figure 6. Table
S2 (Supporting Information) provides the
atomic concentrations (%) of the graphite negative electrode surface
as determined by XPS. For these two electrolytes, the atomic concentration
of C decreased while the concentration of O increased during the initial
discharge, suggesting the formation of the SEI film. Additionally,
we observed a small amount of B on the graphite surface discharged
with the LiDFOB-containing electrolyte, which indicates that the addition
of LiDFOB can modify the SEI by its reduction on the negative electrode
surface. The C 1s spectrum of the pristine graphite shows three peaks.
After discharged to different cutoff voltages in these two electrolytes,
analysis of the MCMB negative electrode indicates new species in the
C 1s, O 1s, and P 2p XPS spectra, which character the decomposition
products of the electrolyte on the graphite surface.45 Except for the peaks shown on the pristine negative electrode,
the new peak at 290 ± 0.3 eV is attributed to CO2-like
carbon from carbonate compounds such as Li2CO3 and/or ROCO2Li and
the other new peak at 287 ± 0.3 eV corresponds to R′CH2OCO2Li and/or LiOCH2R.46,47 Their corresponding
peaks for C=O and C–O are observed in the O 1s spectrum at 531.5 ± 0.2
and 532.5 ± 0.2 eV, respectively.48,49 As displayed
in the C 1s and O 1s spectra in Figure 6, we can see that for the electrolyte without the LiDFOB
additive, the higher relative intensity of the C=O peaks suggests
that the CO2-like compounds are the dominant components
of the SEI layer, indicating much electrolyte decomposition.42 However, for the LiDFOB-containing electrolyte,
the single-bonded carbon dominates the SEI composition. These results
suggest that the addition of LiDFOB can effectively suppress the reductive
decomposition of the FEC-based electrolyte. Furthermore, the P 2p
spectra in Figure 6 display peaks for LiPF6/LixPFy (F–P) (at 137 ± 0.1 eV)
and LixPFyOz (F–P–O) (at 134 ± 0.1 eV) in the SEI layer on
the graphite negative electrodes discharged in these electrolytes.
LixPFyOz species is originated
from the LiPF6 salt decomposition and/or hydrolysis product
in the SEI layer. The intensity of the LixPFyOz peak clearly decreased in the LiDFOB-added electrolyte.
This is likely because LiDFOB captures trace amounts of moisture in
the electrolyte and reduces the decomposition of the salt, which is
in good agreement with the results mentioned above.

core-level XPS spectra for MCMB electrodes
before and after being discharged at 1.8, 1.3, and 0.5 V in 1 M LiPF6/FEC–EMC without and with the LiDFOB additive.

Figure 7 illustrates
the proposed models of the SEI structure in the FEC-based electrolyte
without and with LiDFOB on the MCMB negative electrode surface. In
the absence of the LiDFOB additive, more FEC solvents and LiPF6 salts are reduced to form a thick, breakable SEI film having
more CO2-like compounds, LixPFyOz derivatives,
and LiF on the surface of the graphite, resulting in poor cycling
performance of the graphite. By contrast, incorporation of only 0.5
wt % LiDFOB to a FEC-based electrolyte [1.0 M LiPF6 in
3:7 (FEC–EMC)] results in excellent cycling performance of
the graphite negative electrode. This improved property originates
from the generation of a thin and robust SEI film by the sacrificial
reduction of the LiDFOB additive on the graphite negative electrode
surface and the stabilization of the electrolyte by scavenging HF.

models of the SEI structure in the FEC-based electrolyte
without and with LiDFOB on the MCMB negative electrode surface.

Besides, to investigate the influence
of the 0.5 wt % LiDFOB electrolyte
on the electrochemical performance of the high-voltage positive electrodes,
the high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 positive
electrode was selected and the properties of the LiDFOB additive on
the positive electrode were examined. Figure 8a compares
the cycling capacities of the Li/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cells in different electrolytes at a current density
of 40 mA g–1 and a cutoff voltage of 3.0–5.0
V. Although the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 positive
electrode in the EC-based electrolyte 1 M LiPF6/EC–EMC
displays a slightly high reversible capacity of 122.6 mAh g–1 and a relatively low Coulombic efficiency of 80.8% at the first
cycle, its capacity decreases rapidly down to 95.7 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles, exhibiting a very low capacity retention of 78%.
By contrast, both of the positive electrodes in the FEC-based electrolytes
without and with the LiDFOB additive demonstrate a good cycling stability.
Compared to the positive electrode using the FEC-based electrolyte
with no additive, the positive electrode in the 0.5 wt % LiDFOB electrolyte
shows a strong discharge capacity of 133.8 mAh g–1 in the initial cycle and still delivers a reversible capacity of
130.9 mAh g–1 at 100th cycle, showing an excellent
cyclability with a capacity retention of 98%. Moreover, its initial
Coulombic efficiency still reaches 91.5%, which is almost consistent
with that of the electrolyte without an additive (92.2%). It can be
also seen from the inset of Figure 8a that both of the positive electrodes with the FEC-based
electrolyte without and with the LiDFOB additive display similar charge–discharge
profiles, where the positive electrode in the FEC electrolyte without
an additive has a 50 mV higher charge voltage and a 40 mV lower discharge
voltage than those in the LiDFOB electrolyte, implying that the LiDFOB
additive can form a stable interface film on the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 positive electrode with very low interfacial
impedance to improve the cycling performance of the high-voltage spinel
half cells. The rate capabilities of these electrodes in different
electrolytes are given in Figure 8b. It can be clearly seen that the positive electrode
with the LiDFOB electrolyte also exhibits a good rate capability compared
with the electrode in the FEC-based electrolyte without LiDFOB. These
data suggest that the LiDFOB additive is able to enhance the electrochemical
performance of the high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 positive electrode in the FEC-based electrolyte.

containing 0.5 wt % LiDFOB additive. (d) Comparison of contents of
Mn and Ni ions dissolved from LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 powders stored in these two electrolytes at 25 °C for
20 days.

The effect of the LiDFOB additive
can be evidenced from EIS of
the Li/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cells using
these two FEC-based electrolytes after the 1st, 20th, and 70th cycles
(see Figure 8c). The
results showed that all EIS spectra had two well-defined semicircles
at high frequencies, representing the Li+-ion migration
resistance (RSEI) through the interphase
film on the positive electrode surface and the interfacial charge-transfer
resistance (RCT). It can be seen from Figure 8c that the values
of RSEI and RCT for the LiDFOB electrolyte are smaller than those for the FEC-based
electrolyte without LiDFOB after the 1st, 20th, and 70th cycles, indicating
that in the presence of LiDFOB, a protective interphase film with
low interfacial impedance on the positive electrode surface is formed.
Moreover, with increasing cycles, the RCT value of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 electrode
in the 0.5 wt % LiDFOB-containing electrolyte remains almost at the
same level, indicating that the interphase film remains stable and
has no obvious change during cycling. These results were also confirmed
by the SEM images of the positive electrode surfaces before and after
70 cycles in different electrolytes, as shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). The SEM image of the
positive electrode cycled the 0.5 wt % LiDFOB electrolyte displayed
a very clean surface; no degradation species precipitated on its surface.
Furthermore, the amounts of Mn and Ni dissolution from the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 powders in these two FEC-based
electrolytes at 25 °C for 20 days are measured by inductively
coupled plasma (ICP), as depicted in Figure 8d. It can be seen that 7.24 ppm of Ni ions
and 22.51 ppm of Mn ions are dissolved in the FEC-based electrolyte
with no additive, whereas less than 1.06 ppm of Ni ions and 5.96 ppm
of Mn ions are observed in the LiDFOB-containing electrolyte, which
is related to the role of LiDFOB sequestering PF5 and resulting
in a decrease in the amount of HF formation.37,43,44 Therefore, the decrease of dissolved Ni
and Mn during storage due to the presence of the LiDFOB additive in
the FEC-based electrolyte also improves the cyclability of Li/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 coin cells, as shown in Figure 8a,b. These data indicate
that the addition of 0.5 wt % LiDFOB in the FEC-based high-voltage
electrolyte has positive influence on the interphase film on the positive
electrode surface and significantly decreases the amount of HF formation,
finally leading to excellent cycling performance of the positive electrode.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated, for the
first time, the compatibility
of the FEC-based electrolyte with the graphite negative electrode,
and the result shows that the FEC-based electrolyte is incapable of
forming a protective and effective SEI on the graphite surface, which
is attributed to the fact that FEC has higher reduction potential
compared to its nonfluorinated counterpart EC. To suppress the reduction
of FEC, two lithium salts of LiBOB and LiDFOB have been investigated
as negative-electrode film-forming additives. Incorporation of only
0.5 wt % LiDFOB to a FEC-based electrolyte [1.0 M LiPF6 in 3:7 (FEC–EMC)] results in excellent cycling performance
of the graphite negative electrode. This improved property originates
from the generation of a thin and robust SEI film by the sacrificial
reduction of the LiDFOB additive on the graphite negative electrode
surface and the stabilization of the electrolyte by scavenging HF.
Meanwhile, the incorporated LiDFOB additive has positive influence
on the interphase film on the positive electrode surface and significantly
decreases the amount of HF formation, finally leading to improved
cycling stability and rate capability of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 electrode at a high cutoff voltage of 5 V.
The results demonstrate that the LiDFOB additive not only exhibits
a superior compatibility with graphite but also improves the electrochemical
properties of the high-voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 positive electrode considerably, confirming its potential
as a promising, multifunctional additive for 5 V fluorinated electrolytes
in high-energy capacity lithium-ion batteries.

4 Experimental
Section
Li-battery-grade EMC (purity 99.99%, H2O ≤ 10
ppm) and lithium salts including lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6, purity 99.95%, H2O ≤ 20 ppm), LiBOB (purity
99.9%, H2O ≤ 20 ppm), and LiDFOB (purity 99.9%,
Cl ≤ 15 ppm, H2O ≤ 20 ppm) were purchased
from Zhangjiagang Guotai Huarong New Chemical Materials Co. Ltd, China,
and used without any additional purification process. The solvent
FEC was obtained from BASF SE (purity 99.9%, H2O ≤
10 ppm). We also made some checks by Karl Fischer titration to determine
the water content of EMC and FEC solvents. The result showed that
the contents of water in the EMC and FEC solvents are 5 and 8 ppm,
respectively. The electrolytes used in this work were prepared in
an argon-filled glovebox with an oxygen level and a water level below
5 ppm. The EC-based electrolyte was a mixture of 1.0 M LiPF6 dissolved in EC–EMC (3:7 by volume). All salts and solvents
were used without further purification. All prepared and obtained
electrolytes were stored in an argon-filled glovebox at room temperature.
High-voltage positive electrode material spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 powder was synthesized via solid-state
reaction as reported elsewhere.33 The positive
electrode was composed of 80 wt % active materials, 10 wt % Super
P carbon black, and 10 wt % poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The
graphite negative electrode consisted of 85 wt % MCMB powders, 7 wt
% Super P, and 8 wt % PVDF.

The ion conductivity of the electrolytes
was measured on a DDS-307
(INESA Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) at 25 °C.
The Li plating and stripping behavior in the electrolyte 1 M LiPF6/FEC was measured by CV experiments. CV curves were tested
on Solartron 1470E multichannel potentiostats using a three-electrode
electrochemical cell with a Pt disc of 2 mm diameter as a working
electrode and Li sheet as both reference electrode and counter electrode.
The scan rate was 50 mV s–1. To examine the anodic
behavior of the FEC-based electrolytes without and with an additive,
their initial linear sweep voltammograms were carried out on Solartron
1470E multichannel potentiostats using a three-electrode electrochemical
cell with a Pt disc of 0.1 mm diameter as a working electrode and
Li sheet as both reference electrode and counter electrode. The scan
rate was 5 mV s–1. The compatibilities of lithium
metal with the FEC-based electrolyte were tested by being stored in
an Ar-filled glovebox for 6 months at room temperature. The color
changes of the electrolyte solutions after the storage were observed
and recorded by a digital camera.

The charge–discharge
measurements were performed using a
CR2032-type coin cell assembled in an argon-filled glovebox and carried
out on a Land CT2001A battery testing system (Wuhan, China). The counter
electrode and reference electrode were lithium sheets. The separator
was Celgard 2400 microporous membrane. CV experiments were carried
out on Solartron 1470E multichannel potentiostats using half cells
in a voltage range of 0–2.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1. After the Li/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 coin cell is discharged to 3.0 V, the EIS measurement of
the cells was conducted on an Autolab electrochemical analytical instrument
(ECO CHEMIE, B. V. Utrecht, The Netherlands) with an oscillation amplitude
of 5 mV at a frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz.

The effects
of the LiDFOB additive on the electrochemical compatibilities
of the MCMB negative electrodes were investigated by comparing the
first discharge curves, surface morphology, and composition of MCMB
negative electrode after different cutoff voltages. Galvanostatic
lithiation was performed by the first discharged to 1.8, 1.3, and
0.5 V at a constant current of 5 μA in the FEC-based electrolytes
without and with the LiDFOB additive. After the electrochemical lithiation,
the MCMB samples were washed with pure DMC to remove the precipitates
on the electrode surface. The surface morphology was characterized
using a Phenom Pro electron microscope (Phenom-World, The Netherlands).
EDXS (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) was used to detect the element
composition at various regions on the MCMB negative electrode surface.
XPS measurements were carried out using an AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer
with Al Kα (1253.6 eV) radiation. The binding energy scale was
calibrated from the universal hydrocarbon contamination by using the
C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.

For the Ni and Mn dissolution experiments,
the fresh LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 powders
were, respectively, added into
the fresh FEC-based electrolytes without an additive and with the
LiDFOB additive and then stored in an Ar-filled glovebox at room temperature
for 20 days. The amount of electrolyte was controlled to be 1 mL per
0.1 mg of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 powders.
After the storage, the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 powders were separated by the use of a centrifuge to sample the
electrolytes, and the resulting electrolytes were analyzed via ICP–atomic
emission spectrometry (ICP, Optima 2100, PerkinElmer).
