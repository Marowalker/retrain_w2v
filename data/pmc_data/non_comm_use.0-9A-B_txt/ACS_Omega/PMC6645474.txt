Polymeric composite insulators consisting
of core fiber reinforced
polymer insulators covered with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) housing
are now replacing conventional ceramic insulators especially for high-outdoor
power transmission lines due to some specific advantages. Unlike ceramics,
polymers have relatively shorter life. Outdoor insulators experience
different electrical, mechanical, chemical, and thermal stresses during
service. The long-term service performance of these insulators and
their service life estimation is an important issue, but it is complicated
and time-consuming. The objective of the present investigation is
to check the rate of property deterioration during service and to
find the approximate lifetime. Working insulators with different ages
were collected from service, and the changes in mechanical and electrical
properties and hydrophobicity of the PDMS cover against aging time
were measured. The service life estimated from the change in mechanical
properties and surface hydrophobicity (using MATLAB software) was
compared with the service life of a new compound subjected to accelerated
aging tests. Prediction of service life is helpful for replacement
of aged insulators from service to avoid interruption in power transmission.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Age-resistant polymeric
materials are used for different outdoor
applications such as roof covering, paints, coating, automotive, and
housing or cover for outdoor composite insulators in power transmission
lines.1−5 However, polymers are organic materials that slowly degrade with
time during their service life due to different environmental factors
such as UV radiation, heat, moisture, pollutants, ozone, and oxygen.6−12 These insulators perform their service in an open atmosphere throughout
the season. Power transmission is a global requirement; consequently,
these insulators face different climatic conditions during their service.6−10 The open-atmosphere degradation of polymers is slow but steady,
as revealed through the degradation of different mechanical properties
and the change in their appearance. However, the change in electrical
properties becomes important when polymeric composites are used as
insulators for high-voltage power transmission lines. These composite
insulators are made up with two important components:13,14 a core insulator to provide electrical resistance and mechanical
strength coupled with a cover or housing for environmental protection
made up of polymers such as silicone elastomer [polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS)], ethylene propylene diene elastomer (EPDM), ethylene vinyl
acetate (EVA) copolymer, epoxy, and polyethylene.15−20

In power transmission lines, the electrical insulator is one
of
the most important components. Any weakness present in the insulator
system may cause leakage current and finally failure of the insulator,
causing partial or complete shutdown of power in the grid depending
upon the magnitude of failure.

Ceramic insulators which were
used from the inception are now getting
replaced by polymeric composite insulators in comparatively lower
voltage applications because of certain specific superiorities of
composite insulators over conventional ceramic insulators during service,
such as drastic weight reduction for composite insulators eventually
providing an opportunity for economical and lighter tower design for
power transmission and ease of transportation, handling, and replacement
of insulators. Polymeric insulators provide good retention of hydrophobicity
under wet conditions and surface contamination and thereby exhibit
better performances in environmentally polluted areas and improved
resistance to vandalism.4,17,21−27 The successful performance of the composite insulator depends on
the quality of individual components and also on the quality of different
interfaces present in the system. The elastomeric cover should be
firmly bonded with the core and provide environmental protection and
prevention of water leakage through the composite insulator.13,14 The core [fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) rod] is made up of a glass
fiber reinforced matrix polymer (polyester and epoxy).28,29 The cover/housing is derived from PDMS,15,16 the most popular choice, or other polymers such as EPDM,17,27,30,31 EVA,18,32,33 epoxy,34 and polyethylene.35 Environmental and electrical stress during service causes insulator
surface degradation.36,37 Different detrimental factors
adversely affect the service life of the composite insulator during
service, but the first attack will be experienced by the outer cover/housing.
The detrimental factors are heat, moisture, pollutants, and UV radiation
from the sunrays and electrical discharge.6,7,17,32,38,39 Though PDMS has very
good immunity against moisture, heat, light (UV rays), and oxidation,
because of its strong backbone chain of ∼Si–O–Si∼,
prolonged exposure to these detrimental conditions generally initiates
multiple reactions such as oxidative degradation, photocatalytic degradation,
and hydrolysis.40 As the Si–C bond
is weaker than the Si–O bond, it may be thought that degradation
of polymers during service starts from the organic moiety −CH3 and ultimately affects the backbone chains (∼O–Si–O∼).41 The continuous migration of low-molecular weight
(LMW) fragments of PDMS from the bulk to the surface for retention
of surface hydrophobicity is also affected by aging during service.
Slow but continuous loss of LMW fragments during service leads to
loss of hydrophobicity, favoring the formation of an electrical erosion
path on the polymeric cover. Deep erosion of the cover may expose
the FRP core to the outside environment. Service hazards such as electrical
discharge, sand storm, rain, and acid rain act as cumulative detrimental
factors for the ultimate failure of insulators.30,42−47 As mentioned earlier, the composite insulator consists of different
components and they have specific electrical and mechanical properties
to meet the service requirements. The failure of any individual component
as well as different interfaces present in the system may be fatal.
Both installation and replacement of insulators are hazardous and
time-consuming processes which adversely affect power supply. Therefore,
the long-term performance of the polymeric housing/cover plays an
important role in the service life of composite insulators. Proper
inspection, maintenance, and timely replacement of aged insulators
before failure are key requirements for power supply.

During
service, the matrix polymer may degrade by two phenomena:
(1) the scission of main backbone chains and (2) the cross-linking
of fragmented chains.32,48 PDMS (silicone elastomer) is
preferred over other polymers as a housing material because of its
high environmental stability and retention of hydrophobicity over
a long period of service.36,49 The hydrophobic surface
reduces the tendency of dry-band discharge under wet conditions.50 As stated earlier, as long as the migration
process of LMW fragments from the bulk to the surface continues, the
surface hydrophobicity is well retained.42,51−56Figure 1 shows the
pictures of new (unused) (a), working (b), and failed (c) insulators.

Figure 1 Pictures
of (a) new (unused), (b) working, and (c) failed insulators.

The natural aging of the outdoor
insulator housing occurs because
of the UV radiation present in sunrays.6,17 The UV radiation
coming from sunrays contains different types of UV radiations such
as UVA, UVB, and UVC with varying wavelengths (400–100 nm).57 UVC (100–290 nm) with the lowest wavelength
range gets filtered by the atmosphere and does not reach the earth
surface. Therefore, solar UV radiation consists of mostly UVA (320–400
nm) and some UVB (290–320 nm), and these wavelength ranges
are crucial for high-voltage composite insulators working in open-atmosphere
power transmission lines.58,59 Apart from solar radiation,
insulators also experience UV radiation at their service conditions,
where degradation of polymers is faster and severe.60,61 In fact, these insulators may face UVC for a short time duration
in the event of electrical discharge occurring at the vicinity of
the insulators when effective filtering is not possible. The frequency
(wavelength), intensity, and duration of exposure to incident UV radiations
determine the severity of polymer degradation, but all of these factors
are variable. The deteriorating effect of UV exposure is not fatal
by itself, but it is a slow and continuous process that accelerates
failure under mechanical and electrical stresses experienced during
service. Different atmospheric deposits on the polymer housing may
provide some degree of UV protection.27

In the present work, samples of working insulators from the
field
after 1 to 9 years of service were collected and subjected to different
tests (mechanical, electrical, and hydrophobicity) to evaluate their
conditions and to calculate the rate of deterioration of some properties
against service time. Further, using some standard software, an effort
was made to estimate the probable average lifetime of the polymeric
housing. The field results were also compared with those of accelerated
aging tests done in a laboratory on a standard compound used for insulator
housing.

The approximate service life estimation of these insulators
used
in railway track will be helpful for timely replacement of adequately
aged insulators before failure without affecting the train service.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Composite
insulator samples
include new insulators (zero service period), working insulators with
service duration of 1 to 9 years, and silicone polymer-based standard
insulator compound [containing ∼45 wt % alumina trihydrate
(ATH)]. All were obtained from Indian Railways. The average climatic
conditions of the region (northern India) from where these samples
were collected are very similar, where annual temperature may range
from 1 to 48 °C with an average temperature of 35–40 °C
with dust-laden winds and 85% of average rainfall/year (990 mm). The
average duration of sun exposure is 8–12 h/day.62−64

2.2 Natural Aging
Naturally aged working
insulator samples originated from overhead high-voltage power transmission
lines under open-atmosphere environmental conditions. These samples
were collected from power transmission lines and were usable at the
time of replacement.

2.3 Accelerated Aging
The accelerated
UV aging test was carried out for 9 h in an UV chamber with high-intensity
UV radiation. The UV chamber obtained from Western Quartz (USA) (1800
W quartz lamp and wavelength 250–350 nm) was used (ACS 21–22,
cabinet built by Advance Curing System, Bangalore, India). The wavelength
coverage of the UV source includes the whole UVB range and very small
part of UVC. The distance between the high-intensity UV source (lamp)
and the sample was kept fixed at 7 cm. Thermal aging was carried out
up to 7 days at 150, 160, and 170 °C under dry heat in an aging
oven. Neutralization time (24 h) was provided to all the aged samples,
followed by the measurement of different properties. The average energy
associated with incident UV rays determines the extent of polymer
degradation and associated energy depends on wavelength. As mentioned
earlier, sunrays contain UVA and UVB but UVA in higher percentage
(90–95%). During the experiment, the UV light source (350–250
nm) used for accelerated UV aging mainly covers the UVB (315–280
nm) range coupled with small part of UVA (350–315 nm) and UVC
(280–250 nm) radiations. This broad UV range can take care
of detrimental effects of radiations from both sunrays and electrical
discharge.

2.4 Characterizations
The mechanical
properties were measured by using a Hounsfield universal testing machine
(H10KS). The durometer type A instrument (Shore Instruments and MFG
Co, INC, USA, CV-71200 CONVELOADER) was used to measure the hardness
of different samples. An Agilent high-resistance meter (4339B) was
used to measure the surface resistivity of different samples and was
coupled with an Agilent resistivity cell (16008B). The static contact
angles of different samples were measured using a goniometer (model
no. 264 F4, Rame-Hart Instrument Co.). The measurement of dielectric
properties was performed using a Novocontrol Alpha-A analyzer, Novocontrol
Technologies, Germany. Surface morphology of the samples was analyzed
by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS EVO 60, Carl ZEISS,
Germany). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using TGA
Mettler Toledo (from Mettler Toledo Instruments) under a N2 atmosphere from 45 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min.

All mechanical properties were studied from the edge portion of
the polymer housing on dumbbell-shaped test specimens punched out
from insulator samples in accordance with ASTM D 412.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Change of Properties of
Working Insulator
Samples
3.1.1 Change in Mechanical Properties
The change in mechanical properties may be a good indication in service
life prediction. A reduction in mechanical strength with the increase
in service life is observed (Figure 2a). There is a slow but progressive degradation of
the polymeric insulator cover compound. This is due to open-atmosphere
aging, where UV radiations from sunlight and electrical discharge
adversely affect the matrix polymer. Other factors such as sand storm,
acid rain, and bird pecking also damage the housing. All of these
effects are cumulative and synergistic in nature.

Figure 2 Variation in (a) tensile
strength (TS), (b) EB, and (c) hardness
(Shore A) of different working insulators.

The silicone polymer housing material exhibits a decrease
in elongation
at break (EB) (Figure 2b) and an increase in hardness (Figure 2c) during aging. In general, when polymers
are subjected to aging, two types of chemical reactions take place
in the system: the first is chain scission, that is, fragmentation
of long polymeric chains into short fragments and the second is the
cross-linking of fragmented chains through macroradical formation
followed by recombination of these macroradicals, leading to the formation
of three-dimensional networks with an increase in cross-link density.32,48 If the first process predominates, the net effect will be softening
of the polymer product on aging. If the second process predominates,
the net effect will be hardening of the polymer product with the increase
in aging time. The probable mechanisms of chain scission and cross-linking
of fragmented chains of the PDMS-based insulator under detrimental
environmental conditions (especially under UV radiation) are shown
in Figure 3. In fact,
the natural aging process during service is a complex series of reactions.
Apart from chemical degradation of PDMS, cover/housing surface damage
(cracking and erosion) by sand storm, acid rain, and electrical discharge
is also a likely phenomenon.30,42−47

Figure 3 Schematic
illustration of the mechanism of (a) chain scission and
cross-linking of fragmented chains, (b) degradation, and (c) hydrolysis
of the PDMS-based insulator under detrimental environmental conditions.

In the case of PDMS, the main
polymeric chain of oxygen–silicone–oxygen
(O–Si–O) is strong enough to resist UVA and UVB radiations
but is affected by UVC, which may be accidentally generated for very
short duration in the event of occasional electrical discharges such
as plasma, corona, and dry-band arcing. Along with high-energy UV,
some reactive species such as electrons and free radicals are formed
during corona and plasma discharge, which can initiate main chain
scission.65−67 However, duration of these electrical hazards is
much shorter compared to that of sunlight exposure. Therefore, PDMS
backbone chain scission is a relatively slow process during aging,32 whereas the cross-linking reaction is more predominant
through the involvement of the methyl group attached to the silicone
atom, which can be accomplished by normal UV rays present in sunlight.
The reaction involving the methyl group (−CH3) leads
to the formation of cross-links. The combined effect of aerial oxygen,
high-energy radiation from sun, and electrical discharges during environmental
aging leads to photo-oxidative degradation of PDMS, as shown in Figure 3. The methyl groups
convert to aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids.68−70 Multiple reactions of degradation during environmental aging take
place: chain scission, interchange of bonds, hydrolysis of siloxane
and hydrocarbon groups, cross-linking of siloxane bonds through condensation,
and carbon–carbon cross-linking are also possible.71−73 PDMS as such is a nonpolar polymer, but the polar nature of the
C–Si bond due to electronegativity difference makes the polymer
chain susceptible to hydrolysis.74,75

3.1.2 Change in Electrical Properties
It is expected that
because of natural aging in an open atmosphere,
the surface resistivity of the polymeric housing should change. The
surface resistivity of the silicone housing material changes slowly
with open atmospheric aging time (Figure 4a). The surface resistivity is found to decrease
initially with aging period, but the change becomes marginal after
4–5 years. In fact, the surface resistivity change depends
not only on the matrix polymer but also on the filler added to the
system. These insulators contain ATH (Al2O3·3H2O) in large quantity,61,76−78 which itself is inorganic and insulating in nature, whereas the
silicone elastomer on aging ultimately leads to silica formation on
the surface of the insulators, which itself is a good electrical insulator.
As a result, with aging, the surface resistivity change becomes almost
marginal.

Figure 4 Change in (a) surface resistivity and (b) contact angle of different
working insulators.

3.1.3 Change
in Hydrophobicity
The surface
hydrophobicities of different insulators were measured in terms of
their contact angles. A decrease in hydrophobicity favors the formation
of water droplets and water channels, leading to electrical discharge
on the surface of the insulator. In fact, a large number of successive
and repeated electrical discharges on the surface of the insulator
over a short period of time cause failure of the insulator. PDMS-based
polymeric insulators exhibit excellent hydrophobicity in fresh unused
condition, where the material exhibits a contact angle around 110–115°
with respect to water droplets. However, with prolonged aging due
to different detrimental effects and surface electrical discharge,
there is a continuous reduction in surface hydrophobicity with time
(Figure 4b). The rate
of migration of LMW fraction from the bulk to the surface, which is
responsible for the retention of surface hydrophobicity of the PDMS
insulator, slows down with the increase in service life.27,51−55,79 The polymer PDMS during aging
undergoes progressive cross-linking as revealed from a continuous
increase in surface hardness and brittleness of the cover/housing.
The increase in cross-link density hampers the LMW migration process
because of the reduction in free volume. The migration of low-molar
mass PDMS species to the surface is greatly impeded when the material
is subjected to surface oxidation.73,80 Further progressive
surface aerial oxidation during service converts some hydrophobic
methyl groups (−CH3) of PDMS to oxygen-containing
hydrophilic groups such as aldehydes, ketones (−CHO, >C=O),
and carboxylic acids (−COOH), and this may also contribute
to the reduction in hydrophobicity. The reduction in hydrophobicity
increases the chances of surface electrical discharge and ultimate
failure of the insulator.

3.1.4 Change in Dielectric
Properties
Dielectric properties such as dielectric constant
and dielectric
loss factor play an important role in the performance of high-voltage
insulators (Figure 5a,b). The increase in the dielectric constant and loss factor will
cause an enhancement of localized electrical field stress, leading
to an increase in the chance of partial discharge under high voltage
in the microvoids or defects generated in the insulator body during
aging.32,81−84 This increase in loss factor
with prolonged aging reveals the initiation of deterioration of the
insulating material. The dielectric constant also shows some weak
tendency to increase with aging time. The increase in dielectric properties
may be due to the oxidative degradation of the polymer compound, absorption
of moisture, or ionic contaminants in trace amount during normal aging
in service. It may be expected that with further advancement of service
life, some more changes in dielectric properties may be observed because
of the increase in polar and ionic species in course of different
reactions taking place. However, the increase in the degree of cross-linking
will decrease the extent of polarization and hence lead to some decrease
in dielectric properties. However, a very large change in dielectric
properties may not be observed as ultimately PDMS converts to silica,
which again is a good insulating material.

constant and (b) dielectric loss at
a 50 Hz frequency of different insulators.

3.1.5 Surface Morphology
The analysis
of surface morphology of the insulator housing can be effectively
used as a tool for the measurement of extent of degradation during
aging. However, a clear cut scale of surface roughness indicating
the end of service life is yet to be established. However, it is clearly
seen that with the increase in the service life, the surface quality
of the silicone insulator progressively deteriorates (becomes more
and more rough). This change in surface roughness can be detected
by a scanning electron microscope and even by a normal optical microscope
in many cases. In fact, the surface morphology of new samples can
also provide some information about the quality of the elastomer compound
used for housing as well as the molding process adapted.

The
surface topologies of new samples (Figure 6a) reveal that the surfaces of polymeric
insulators are more or less uniform and smooth. In fact, even for
new samples of composite insulators, the surface morphology is found
to be slightly rough. The SEM image of new samples also reveals the
quality of the PDMS compound used for making the composite insulator.
To improve resistance against surface electrical discharge, the PDMS
compound contains a large amount of filler-like ATH (Al(OH)3, commonly written as Al2O3·3H2O). The proper dispersion of the filler in the polymer matrix plays
an important role in the quality of the silicone polymer compound.
White spots throughout the surface reveal the presence of the filler,
and the size of these clusters also varies, which signifies the level
of dispersion obtained in the final compound. The molded elastomeric
sheet has some fine roughness; this is mainly because it is filled
with elastomeric composites having a high concentration of the particulate
filler ATH. Further, if mold surfaces are not very smooth, they can
give some rough impression on the insulator housing surface.

Figure 6 Surface morphology
of (a) fresh sample and (b) 3 year, (c) 6 year,
and (d) 9 year working composite insulators.

In fact, with the increase in aging period during prolonged
service
life, there is a continuous increase in surface roughness, exhibiting
cracks and cut marks. For the new sample, such cracks are not visible.
However, when the housing samples are subjected to aging, there will
be appearance of small cracks on the insulator surface. Small cracks
initially develop progressively and grow into long and continuous
cracks on the housing material.

Figure 6b reveals
the SEM micrograph of the insulator housing subjected to 3 years of
service. This is an in-service sample. The surface roughness for samples
having 3 years of service life reveals deterioration started on the
surface within 3 years of natural aging. With natural aging under
an open atmosphere, the insulator housing surface exhibited a change
of surface from relatively smooth to rough. In fact, the change in
surface roughness for the sample subjected to only 3 years of aging
is not very significant.

Figure 6c,d exhibits
the silicone polymer insulator surface subjected to 6 and 9 years
of service under an open atmosphere during operation in transmission
lines. The cracks and cut marks are visible on the surfaces. With
the increase in service life of these insulators, the surface roughness
increases progressively as apparent for the insulator samples subjected
to 9 years of service (Figure 6d). Thus, the surface topology can give some idea about service
life. This reveals that the surface topology of the insulator housing
made from the silicone polymer (PDMS) changes continuously with the
increase in service life under an open atmosphere. Some surface roughness
may also be due to the atmospheric erosion due to sand storm and electrical
discharge during service. The degradation of the matrix polymer and
consumption of the filler ATH during surface electrical discharge
may also increase the surface roughness.

The PDMS insulator
housing is exposed to environmental hazards
such as UV radiations, ozone, and corona and plasma discharges. These
detrimental factors in the presence of oxygen cause oxidation of the
material surface, thereby converting the surface from hydrophobic
to hydrophilic in nature. Along with oxidation, hydrolysis, main chain
scission, and cross-linking reaction also take place. The increase
in cross-link density of the insulator cover surface also contributes
to its transformation from hydrophobic to hydrophilic character. The
increased cross-link density results in the formation of a more rigid
(glassy) and dense surface layer compared to the virgin surface. There
is formation of oxygen-rich surface like SiOX (X > 2) in aged insulator, when, X = 2 in case of virgin material. This oxygen-rich highly
cross-linked surface layer is rigid and prone to crack easily under
natural stress. The surface cracking is a long-term process and leads
to degradation of the insulator.65,85

3.1.6 Thermogravimetric Analysis
Figure 7a,b shows the TGA
and differential TGA (DTG) curves of fresh and working insulators
with different life periods (3, 6, and 9 years) in service.

Figure 7 (a) TGA and
(b) DTG curves of fresh and working insulators with
different life periods (3, 6, and 9 years).

TGAs of fresh (unaged) and working (not failed) samples from
service
reveal that there are two stages of decomposition for the PDMS-based
insulator housing compounds. These housing compounds contain a large
amount of ATH to improve resistance against dry-band discharge.76,77

The first stage of decomposition starts at a temperature of
226–227
°C for working and new samples because of the dehydration of
ATH, where weight loss is due to firmly bonded water of hydration.86−88  

It is interesting
to note that initiation temperatures of decomposition
for different samples are more or less the same. The peak temperature
for the first stage of decomposition is the temperature at which the
maximum degradation has taken place. It can be seen that the peak
temperature shifts toward lower temperature as the service life of
the composite insulator increases (Table 1). The second stage of degradation, however,
starts at different temperatures for the new unused sample and working
samples with different age profiles. It is noteworthy that initiation
of the second stage degradation is taking place at lower temperatures
when the service life of the composite insulator increases. The second
stage of decomposition is due to the breakdown of the polymer matrix
(PDMS).

Table 1 TGA of Different Insulators
sample	peak deg.
temp. (°C)	% wt loss
at the first stage	% wt loss
at the second stage	% residue
content	
fresh	344 & 523	14	38.5	47.5	
3 yrs working	309 & 498	16	34.5	49.5	
6 yrs working	296 & 508	16	32.5	51.5	
9 yrs working	291 & 479	16	26.5	57.5	
The second stage of degradation of
composite insulators can also
be related to their service life. On an average, it can be said that
both initiation temperature and peak temperature for the second stage
of decomposition shift toward lower temperatures as the service life
of the composite insulator increases. Because of the increase in service
life of the composite insulator, the insulator housing compounds are
exposed to different types of environmental hazards along with a number
of nonfatal electrical discharges. Both electrical discharge and UV
radiation have a detrimental effect on the housing polymer and are
reflected in the lowering of second stage decomposition temperature
with the increase in service life due to an increase in radiation
exposure time and an increase in the number of electrical discharges
encountered during specified periods of service. In fact, during surface
electrical discharge due to a significant increase in temperature,
both degradation of the matrix polymer and dehydration of the ATH-like
filler present in the compound can happen.44,89−92 Therefore, it may be concluded that the second stage decomposition
temperature measured through TGA for a housing material is related
to its service life.

3.2 Accelerated Thermal Aging
of the PDMS Insulator
Accelerated aging tests were also carried
out on the insulator
compound to compare normal aging and accelerated aging and to understand
the main detrimental factor that plays the most dominant role in aging
of the PDMS-based insulator compound. One standard insulator compound
was taken and subjected to accelerated aging, and different property
variations are monitored.

3.2.1 Change in Mechanical
Properties
The PDMS compound shows marginal change in properties
during accelerated
heat aging carried out at temperatures as high as 140 °C. To
get appreciable change in properties due to thermal aging, the aging
temperature is increased to 150 °C and beyond. The variations
of mechanical properties for different time durations at aging temperatures
of 150, 160, and 170 °C are presented in Figures 8a and 9b. It can be
seen that the rate of decrease in TS as well as EB is quite fast initially
up to 24 h (1 day); thereafter, the decrease in TS as well as EB becomes
relatively slower compared to the initial aging period. The main chain
of PDMS consists of a very stable bond (Si–O–Si), which
is less affected during thermal aging.32 However, the pendent methyl groups (−CH3) along
the chain are susceptible to thermal oxidation. In fact, the process
of degradation is initiated from the decomposition of pendent groups
mainly consisting of methyl (−CH3) and very few
vinyl groups (−CH2=CH2−),
which may be present in the system. As the Si–C bond is weaker
than the Si–O bond, it may be thought that degradation of the
polymer starts from the organic moiety −CH3, which
ultimately affects the main chain. After the initial degradation of
surface layer of matrix polymer, perhaps there is formation of some
thermally stable silicate layers over the polymer matrix, which retards
further thermo-oxidative process. The progressive reduction of EB
(Figure 8b) and the
increase in hardness (Figure 8c) reveal that both chain scission and cross-linking processes
are operative in the system during high-temperature thermal aging.

Figure 8 Change
in (a) TS, (b) EB, (c) hardness, and (d) rate of deterioration
of EB under accelerated thermal aging.

Figure 9 Change in (a) TS and (b) EB under accelerated UV aging.

Thus, during thermal aging, the rate of polymer
degradation can
be calculated by drawing a tangent to the curve of EB versus aging
time. The rate is again temperature-dependent and was calculated at
different aging temperatures. The activation energy for aging can
be calculated using the standard Arrhenius plot (Figure 8d). The activation energy thus
calculated from the Arrhenius equation was found to be 2.7 ×
104 J mol–1 K–1.

3.3 Accelerated UV Aging of the PDMS Insulator
3.3.1 Change in Mechanical Properties
Polymeric weather sheds
are used to protect composite insulators
in service. These polymeric weather sheds should have some mechanical
properties to perform their service. Loss of mechanical properties
with aging is an important factor to be considered for ensuring adequate
service life. Open atmosphere temperature generally varies from subzero
to as high as 50 °C in tropical regions and 51.5 °C in tropical
deserts in India.93 In fact, the surface
temperature can go easily beyond 50 °C. The maximum temperature
of service may not be very high in general, but prolonged exposure
to sunrays for several years may cause slow and continuous degradation
of chemical, mechanical, and electrical stresses. However, the housing
material may be exposed to a much higher temperature well beyond 170
°C, the highest aging temperature for a very short duration during
electrical discharges.44,89−92

Heating due to direct sunlight
exposure in tropical or desert regions is one of the main environmental
stresses that influence the performance of PDMS insulators.94 Further electrical discharges occurring on housing
surface in the event of corona, plasma and dry band arcing may result
substantially high increase in surface temperature for very short
time duration. Oxidative degradation of PDMS in the presence of atmospheric
oxygen increases both O/C and O/Si molar ratios for the aged housing
surface compared to the original compound.6,37,72,95 The intensity
of UV rays experienced by the insulators depends on climatic and geographical
conditions and clock time. UVA radiation with a wavelength of 330
nm can impart 398 kJ/mol, which is sufficient to break the Si–C
bond (a bond strength of 301 kJ/mol) but not enough to break the Si–O
bond (a bond strength of 443 kJ/mol), which can be broken by UV radiations
with a wavelength ≤ 267 nm.96 This
level of energy is available from UVC radiation. There is also another
source of UV radiation, which occurs accidentally during electrical
discharges such as plasma, corona, and dry-band arcing on the housing
surface. Its intensity is high but duration is short, as the electrical
discharge occurs very close to the insulator, is not filtered, and
may contain high-energy UVC to affect backbone chains. As stated earlier,
a number of nonfatal discharges may occur during the service life
of an insulator before it becomes totally ineffective. Sand storm
erosion and polymer hydrolysis by rain and acid rain can also cause
polymer degradation. However, detrimental activities of different
environmental and service hazards are synergistic and cumulative in
nature. Therefore, overall degradation of the PDMS housing material
in service is a combined effect of all detrimental factors mentioned.

Figure 9a,b shows
the change of TS and EB, respectively, under accelerated UV aging.
Both TS and EB decrease with the increase in UV exposure time. However,
the initial drop in properties is found to be quite high, especially
in the case of EB. However, with further increase in time, the drop
in both properties is comparatively less. These changes in properties
are due to the overall degradation of PDMS under UV exposure.

3.3.2 Change in Electrical Properties
The reduction of surface
resistivity under UV aging has a technical
importance regarding the performance of the composite insulator. It
is working under high voltage; dry-band discharge may take place because
of the reduction of surface resistivity.

Figure 10a shows the change in surface resistivity
under accelerated UV aging. It is found that the surface resistivity
decreases initially with increase in the time period of accelerated
UV aging. However, as seen in the case of the silicone insulator exposed
to open-atmosphere aging, the surface resistivity of the accelerated
UV-aged insulator compound also exhibits a marginal change beyond
a certain period of accelerated aging, for example, after 150 min
of aging. This indicates that polymer degradation in an open atmosphere
under sunlight and electrical discharge shows a trend slightly similar
to that of degradation under accelerated UV aging. Therefore, it may
be concluded that UV radiation present in sunlight and electrical
discharges plays an important role in insulator aging during service.

accelerated UV radiation.

3.3.3 Change in Hydrophobicity
The change
in hydrophobicity under accelerated UV aging is shown in Figure 10b. The exposure
to high-intensity UV radiation adversely affects the surface hydrophobicity
of the insulator; in fact, the hydrophobic surface changes to a hydrophilic
surface. The accelerated aging under high-intensity UV radiation reduces
the tendency of migration of LMW PDMS molecules to the insulator surface.
During UV aging, the % EB reduces and hardness increases, which shows
that the sample undergoes both chain scission and a high degree of
cross-linking, thereby reducing the matrix free volume. This free-volume
reduction hampers LMW migration from the bulk to the surface.

3.3.4 Surface Morphology
The surface
morphology plays an important role in the performance of the insulator.36,38,69,80,97 With aging, if there is formation of any
cracks and/or debris, these cracks and debris may accumulate pollutants,
salts, and carbon particles from the environment and create conductive
deposits on the insulator surface. These external foreign materials
further absorb/collect moisture, leading to the formation of a thin
conductive layer causing electrical discharge on the insulator housing
surface.

Figure 11 shows the change in surface morphology under UV aging. It was found
that with the increase in aging time, the surface roughness also increases.
After 9 h of accelerated UV aging (Figure 11d), it was also found that polymer chains
on the surface degraded leaving behind some exposed filler particles.
These surface filler particles are less strongly bonded with the main
body of the housing. These filler particles can absorb atmospheric
moisture, causing electrical discharge.

3.4 Lifetime Estimation of a High-Voltage Insulator
Subjected to Natural Aging during Service through MATLAB Modeling
Ceramic or glass insulators used for power transmission lines have
a long service life often more than 50 years. However, though polymeric
insulators exhibit superiority in many respects, they are expected
to give relatively shorter service life. As these materials are being
used only in the recent past, their expected life is yet to be confirmed.
Outdoor polymeric insulators used on railway tracks should provide
long service life and should be replaced before failure without affecting
the train service. Therefore, the estimation of approximate service
life for this product is very important.

One of the aims of
the present investigation is to estimate the lifetime of silicone
rubber (PDMS) composite insulators using material properties. In this
study, an effort has been made to predict approximate lifetime based
on two key properties: (1) % EB and (2) hydrophobicity measured in
terms of contact angle.

3.4.1 Change in % EB Due to
Natural Aging
Lifetime prediction in terms of residual elongation
(retained elongation
after aging) for elastomeric components is well known and generally
done for engineering products and electrical cable materials.98−100 Working insulators of different service lives were collected, and
their EB was measured (Figure 12). EB decreases with service life, and the time to
reach residual minimum EB of 50% has been calculated mathematically
using MATLAB programming (equation fitting). The time taken to reach
50% residual elongation in the sample was calculated whose original
EB was around 279%. The extrapolated time to reach residual EB was
calculated based on a mathematical expression (eq 1). 1  where y stands for the properties
(EB) and x stands for the time. From MATLAB software
calculation, a and b are two constants
in the expression, whose values are 290.7 and 0.07492, respectively.
The estimated time to reach minimum 50% EB for the PDMS insulator
in service is ∼23.5 years.

Figure 12 Change of EB (% EB) with the duration
of service life (years).

3.4.2 Change in Hydrophobicity Due to Natural
Aging
Service life estimation is also done based on the hydrophobicity
measurement in terms of contact angle with a limiting value of 90°.
The decrease of surface hydrophobicity leads to an increase in the
probability for coalescences of water droplets and water channels,
thereby facilitating surface discharge, and a large number of successive
and repeated electrical discharges over a short period of time may
lead to failure of the insulators. Polymeric insulators based on PDMS
exhibit excellent hydrophobicity in the new sample (unaged) when the
sample contact angle with respect to water droplets is on the order
of 110–115°. However, with increase in aging time and
electrical discharges, there is a reduction in hydrophobicity, which
is reflected through the reduction in contact angle. As per the normal
standard, a surface that exhibits a contact angle ≥ 90°
with respect to water droplets is considered as hydrophobic in nature.
The minimum residual contact angle for the aged insulator has been
fixed as 90°. However, for practical service condition, any PDMS
insulator with surface hydrophobicity measured in terms of contact
angle ≥ 90° may still provide satisfactory service life
even for a few more years.

On the basis of these criteria from
the contact angle measurement on different working insulators with
various service life are plotted against time, and the time to reach
the minimum contact angle of 90° is estimated from the extrapolation
of this plot using MATLAB software and a similar mathematical equation
(eq 1) (Figure 13), where y represents the properties (contact angle) and x is the time (service life). Moreover, a and b are constants, and their values are 111.7 and 0.01062
respectively. If the limiting value of y is kept 90°, then the
approximate service life was found to be ∼20 years.

Figure 13 Change in
contact angle with the duration of service life (years).

3.5 Service Life Estimation
from Accelerated Aging
Test of a High-Voltage Compound Material
Lifetime estimation
of the insulator compound subjected to natural aging in service has
been done using MATLAB. Similarly, lifetime estimation of the PDMS
insulator compound subjected to the accelerated aging process has
also been done to compare natural aging and accelerated aging processes.

As done in the previous case, lifetime estimation through accelerated
aging has been done based on the change in EB and hydrophobicity measured
in terms of contact angle. It is to be mentioned here that the laboratory
accelerated aging process is exclusively based on exposure of the
sample to high-intensity UV radiation for different time intervals,
followed by the measurement of residual properties of the compound.
As the degradation process is quite fast under high-intensity UV radiation,
the exposure time of the sample to UV radiation has been limited to
a maximum of 9 h. The same limiting value of EB (50% residual EB)
and contact angle (90°) for the end of service life has been
used to determine the end limit for lifetime.

3.5.1 Change
in % EB Due to Accelerated UV Aging
Accelerated aging tests
are carried out under high-power UV to
check the detrimental effect on the polymer housing. A high-power
UV source provides faster degradation of PDMS samples. The UV aging
was performed for different time durations up to 9 h to calculate
the time required for drop in EB (residual EB) ≈ 50% is estimated
(Figure 14). The values
were fitted to the standard equation (eq 2) using MATLAB software. The service life calculated
under accelerated UV aging is found to be around 7 h 33 min. 2  where x represents the time
duration of UV aging and y denotes the properties
(% EB). Moreover, a, b, c, and d are constants, and their values
are 137.5, 0.07123, 134.5, and 0.002182, respectively.

Figure 14 Change in
EB (% EB) with time under accelerated UV aging.

3.5.2 Change in Hydrophobicity Due to Accelerated
UV Aging
The change in surface hydrophobicity due to UV aging
can also be used as a criterion for predicting service life. It was
observed that the contact angle decreases with the time duration of
accelerated UV aging (Figure 15). The limiting contact angle for the hydrophobicity test
was kept at 90°. The service life from contact angle was also
estimated using MATLAB programming (eq 1). The service life estimated from accelerated UV aging
is found to be 4 h 4 min, where y represents the
properties (contact angle) and x denotes the time
duration of accelerated UV aging. Moreover, a and b are two constants, and their values are 105.3 and 0.0006429,
respectively.

Figure 15 Change in contact angle with time under accelerated UV
aging.

The variation of EB against UV
exposure or accelerated aging is
presented in Figure 14. It can be seen that EB reduces with UV exposure time and the limiting
value of EB (50% residual EB) is attained around 7 h 33 min of aging
under high-intensity UV radiation. The surface contact angle reduces
with aging time, and the limiting value of contact angle (90°)
attained is around 4 h 4 min. The surface hydrophobicity measured
in terms of contact angle plays a crucial role in the electrical discharge
phenomenon for high-voltage insulators. Under wet climatic conditions,
isolated water droplets may form on the insulator surface, which does
not help in electrical discharge under high voltage. However, continuous
loss of hydrophobicity aids in the formation of a continuous water
line through coalescence of a number of droplets, providing an easy
path for electrical discharge.

It is important to note here
that the average service life obtained
from accelerated UV aging under high-intensity UV radiation is significantly
less than that of samples subjected to natural aging, especially when
hydrophobicity is considered as a variable factor. This reveals that
perhaps the mechanism of degradation under high-intensity UV radiation
is different from that under low-intensity UV radiation available
from sunrays. The extent of degradation is also substantially high
when the sample is subjected to high-intensity UV radiation for a
shorter time compared to actual insulators under the natural aging
process under normal sunlight during their service.

4 Summary and Conclusions
A slow but steady deterioration
of normal properties occurs for
polymeric insulators during service. From the natural aging process,
lifetime prediction can be done from variation of EB and change in
hydrophobicity. The lifetime estimated from EB is found to be around
23–24 years with a limiting residual EB value of 50%, whereas
when it is measured from the change in hydrophobicity, the average
service life is around 20 years, with a limiting contact angle value
of 90°.

However, in real-life situation, if the contact
angle reduces below
90°, it does not make the insulator surface highly hydrophilic
and sensitive to electrical discharge under wet conditions. In fact,
these aged insulators still can provide some more years of service
life. The estimation of service life from the contact angle measurement
has certain practical limitations: attainment of equilibrium in contact
angle measurement is rather difficult. There is a loss of hydrophobicity
due to different kinds of aging processes such as electrical discharge,
UV radiation, heat aging, and high-intensity rain during service life.
However, there is a regain of hydrophobicity for PDMS insulators,
which is a time-dependent process as discussed earlier, and the regain
process slows down with service life (aging time). Therefore, estimation
of service life from EB is more reliable compared to that from contact
angle measurement.

The probable service life estimated from
accelerated aging conditions
under high-temperature and high-power UV radiation is substantially
less than that obtained from natural aging. The comparison of results
obtained from natural aging and accelerated aging reveals that these
two degradation processes are governed by two different mechanisms.
However, both accelerated aging tests under high-temperature and high-intensity
UV can provide useful information about rate of aging and service
life.
