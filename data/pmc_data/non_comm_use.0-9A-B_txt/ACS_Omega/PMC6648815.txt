Inorganic nanofiltration membranes with high flux are
urgently needed in water purification processes. Herein, polydopamine
(PDA)-modified layer-stacked molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanofiltration membranes (NFMs) were fabricated via a pressure-assisted
self-assembly process. The separation performance of the as-prepared
membranes with various MoS2 loadings at different dopamine
polymerization times was evaluated. The pure water permeance of PDA-modified
MoS2 NFMs, with MoS2 loading of 0.1103 mg/cm2 at 4 h modification, could reach 135.3 LMH/bar. The rejection
toward methylene blue could reach 100% with molecular weight cutoff
approximately 671 Da and a high permeability of salts. Furthermore,
the resultant membrane also exhibited a satisfactory long-term stability
toward dye solution and antifouling property toward bovine serum albumin.
This work may give inspiration to the development of inorganic membranes
with high performance, especially high pure water permeance, for water-related
processes.

1 Introduction
According
to The United Nation World Water Development Report 2018,
the global demand of clean water has been increasing at a rate of
about 1% per year, owing to the economic development, population growth,
and changing consumption patterns.1 Hence,
clean water is limited, and there is a large requirement of treatment
technology for industrial water and domestic water.

Nanofiltration,
thanks to its low cost, high efficiency, low energy consumption, and
facile operational process,2 has been widely
used in water softening, desalination, wastewater reclamation, and
industrial substance separation.3−5 In general, nanofiltration is defined as a pressure-driven membrane
filtration mode intermediate between reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration,6,7 and has a high rejection of species ranging from 0.001 to 0.01 μm
with a relatively high water flux.3 Polymeric
nanofiltration membranes (NFMs), although widely used, could suffer
from some intrinsic drawbacks such as unsatisfying mechanical strength,
thermal properties, and physicochemical stability.8,9 Especially,
when polymeric NFMs are used in water purification process, swelling
is an unavoidable problem.4 On the other
hand, although inorganic NFMs have a better performance on durability
and pure water flux compared to polymeric NFMs,10,11 some
drawbacks may also exist, such as brittleness and incompatibility
to flexible substrates used in water purification processes.6,12,13

Recently, two-dimensional
(2D) layered inorganic materials have been widely studied because
of their excellent flexible mechanical properties.14,15 Particularly,
2D graphene oxide (GO) has been made for a variety of NFMs with exceptional
performance.16−20 For instance,
Zhang et al.21 prepared a novel GO framework
composite NFM via a layer-by-layer approach, endowing it with high
rejections toward heavy metal and a water permeability of 4.7 LMH/bar.
Mi et al.22 fabricated GO NFMs via layer-by-layer
deposition of GO nanosheets, followed by cross-linking with 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl
trichloride. The GO NFMs exhibited a high rejection toward Rhodamine
WT and a water flux ranging between 8.00 and 27.6 LMH/bar. As a typical
transition-metal dichalcogenide, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a new kind of 2D layered inorganic material and a laminar crystal
with many unique properties, such as low cost, high surface area,
and low cytotoxicity.23−26 It can also exhibit structural stability
and frictionless smooth surface without oxygen-containing groups.27−29 And the layer-stacked MoS2 membranes also have the characteristics of antiswelling and
rigid nanochannels.26 Thus, these properties
could endow the MoS2 layer-stacked membrane with higher
and steadier water permeance during water filtration process.29 The group of Mi has discovered that the interlayer
spacing with 1.2 nm of fully hydrated MoS2 nanosheets could
meet the requirements of moderate molecular rejection and high water
permeability. And with a high pressure, the MoS2 membrane
could exhibit a satisfactory neatly layer-stacked nanostructure to
create a condition for stable water flux and rejection performance.26 Wang et al.30 successfully
prepared ultrathin single-layered MoS2-based membranes
with controlling thickness well for gas separation. Zhang et al.31 prepared a low-pressure nanofiltration membrane
comprising MoS2 nanosheets as spacers in the GO layers
through the forward treatment of pressure-assisted assembly and heat.
This GO/MoS2 NFM exhibited a rejection of more than 95%
toward different charged dyes with a pure water permeability of 10.2
LMH/bar, which was 13.6 times that of pristine GO NFM. Furthermore,
the GO/MoS2 NFMs also have exhibited satisfactory antifouling
properties and stability. Zhou et al.32 prepared a hybrid membrane through layer-by-layer self-assembling
polyelectrolyte multilayers with incorporating MoS2 nanosheets
modified by poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) (PDDA@MoS2 nanosheets). The water flux of the hybrid membrane was 2.3
times that of the pure polyelectrolyte membrane with good long-term
stability. In the work of Liang et al.,33 the MoS2 was modified by zwitterion (poly(sulfobetaine
methacrylate), PSBMA) to prepare MoS2–PSBMA/polyethersulfone
(PES) composite membranes by the conventional phase inversion method.
And the composite membrane exhibited a high rejection toward dye and
a high flux of 108.3 LMH at 0.6 MPa. All of these previous studies
have made it reasonable to fabricate MoS2 membranes to
improve water flux in nanofiltration process.

Inspired by mussel,
dopamine has been widely used to modify different kinds of membrane
surfaces because it can nonspecifically adhere to various substrates
under weak alkaline and oxygen-containing environment.6,34 After modification, various properties of membranes, such as tenacity,
antifouling, and surface hydrophilicity, could be improved.35−39 Hence, we developed a novel layer-stacked
MoS2 nanofiltration membrane via the pressure-assisted
self-assembly technique. Subsequently, the surface of MoS2 membrane was modified by dopamine dip-coating method. In this process,
dopamine could polymerize to highly cross-linked adhesive polydopamine
(PDA) through the process of consecutive oxidation, intramolecular
cyclization, and oligomerization in alkaline oxygen condition, where
a conformal coating on the surface of the MoS2 membrane
could be formed. MoS2 nanosheets and the as-prepared membranes
were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ζ-potential,
X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR),
and water contact angles. The nanofiltration performance of PDA-modified
MoS2 membranes (PDA/MoS2 NFMs) with various
MoS2 loadings at different dopamine polymerization times
was investigated in detail. In addition, the molecular weight cutoff
(MWCO), antifouling property, and long-term stability of PDA/MoS2 NFMs were also tested.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Exfoliated MoS2
The
morphology of exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets is shown in Figure 1. The AFM images
(Figure 1a,b) indicated
that the thickness of the exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets was
about 2–3 nm. And the thickness of a single MoS2 layer is around 0.9–1.2 nm;40 therefore,
the obtained MoS2 nanosheets were few-layer nanosheets
that were suitable for the membrane formation. The 2D ultrathin nanosheet
morphology of exfoliated MoS2 was further investigated
by TEM. As can be seen in Figure 1c, the lamellar size of the individual MoS2 nanosheets was generally less than 400 nm.

profiles along the three lines shown in the AFM image. (c) TEM image
of exfoliated MoS2.

2.2 Characterization of PDA/MoS2 NFMs
The surface morphology of the membrane was observed by SEM. As
shown in Figure 2a,
there was irregular bumpiness with some nanostructured papillae on
the surface of the membrane at a dopamine polymerization time of 4
h. The catechol group of dopamine could be oxidized to benzoquinone
with high reaction activity in a weak alkaline solution in the presence
of oxygen. Then, it was self-polymerized to PDA nanoaggregates through
the covalent cross-linking and noncovalent self-assembly to form a
modification layer onto the MoS2 membrane surface.41,42 Therefore, the surface roughness of the membrane was ascribed to
the accumulation of PDA nanoaggregates.

and (b) cross-sectional morphology
of PDA(4)/MoS2(0.1103) NFMs.

The cross-sectional
morphology of the membrane is shown in Figure 2b. The active layer of PDA(4)/MoS2(0.1103) NFM was tightly coated on the porous substrate without interfacial
defects. The active layer was a laminar MoS2 layer coated
by the PDA nanoaggregates with a uniform thickness of about 2.2 μm.

The surface morphologies of the membranes were further observed
by the three-dimensional AFM images (Figure 3). With the increase of polymerization time,
more and more PDA nanoaggregates were deposited onto the surfaces
of the membranes, which increased the surface roughness and tuned
the membrane surface properties.

NFMs at different polymerization times: (a) 0 h, (b) 1 h, (c) 2 h,
(d) 4 h, and (e) 6 h.

The membrane surface hydrophilicity
was demonstrated by the water contact angle analysis. As shown in Figure 4, water contact angles
of the membranes were remarkably decreased with the extension of dopamine
polymerization time. These phenomena could be explained by that the
hydrophilic PDA nanoaggregates, with abundant hydrophilic amine and
hydroxyl groups, were deposited gradually along with the polymerization
time.43,44 On the one hand, the surface hydrophilicity
was enhanced by the deposition of PDA. On the other hand, the surface
structure would become more compact with increasing polymerization
time. And the relatively compact surface is more beneficial for spreading
of water droplets, thereby the water contact angles could be decreased.45

and (b) water
contact angles of PDA(X)/MoS2(0.1103)
NFMs at different polymerization times.

The ζ-potential of membrane surface
is an important characteristic that is relevant to the separation
property of membranes. According to one of the nanofiltration mechanisms,
the Donnan effect, the membrane is tended to reject the molecule with
the same electricity as the membrane surface and to infiltrate the
molecule with opposite electricity to the membrane surface.45 The results of ζ-potential of hydrolyzed
polyacrylonitrile (HPAN) substrate, MoS2 NFM, and PDA/MoS2 NFM are shown in Figure 5. These three kinds of membranes were all proved to
be negatively charged at pH 4–10, especially at the neutral
application conditions. The polyacrylonitrile (PAN) substrate could
generate carboxyl groups (−COOH) after the hydrolyzation of
nitrile groups in NaOH solution, which was the main factor of the
negative electricity of the HPAN surface at pH 4–10.46,47 In Figure 5, it could
also be observed that, compared with HPAN, the electronegativity of
NFM loaded with MoS2 was enhanced, which could be ascribed
to the electronegativity of MoS2.26 Due to the weak electronegativity of PDA, the electronegativity
of the membrane surface was slightly lower after PDA modification.48

of membranes at different pH
values.

As shown in Figure 6, there was an intensive peak (002) at 2θ
= 14.4° on the XRD spectra of MoS2 NFM and PDA/MoS2 NFM, which was in accordance with the typical hexagonal structure
peaks of MoS2 (JCPDS card No. 77-1716).49

Figure 6 XRD spectra
of MoS2 NFM and PDA/MoS2 NFM.

FT-IR spectra of HPAN, MoS2 NFM, and PDA/MoS2 NFM samples are shown in Figure 7. The characteristic peak at around 1727
cm–1 corresponded to C=O stretching vibration,
which confirmed the hydrolyzation of PAN substrate membrane. This
peak became weaker and weaker after MoS2 loading and PDA
modification.50,51 For the spectrum of PDA(4)/MoS2(0.1103) NFM, a new peak appeared at 1566 cm–1, which was attributed to the N–H vibration in PDA.6 And the broad band at around 3400 cm–1 was related to the catechol −OH group and N–H group
from PDA, which also indicated the effectivity of PDA modification.32,50,52,53

MoS2 NFM, and PDA(4)/MoS2(0.1103) NFM.

2.3 Membrane Performance
2.3.1 Effect of MoS2 Loading
The influence of MoS2 loading on the
pure water permeance and dye rejection was investigated. As shown
in Figure 8, with the
increase of MoS2 loading from 0.03597 to 0.1415 mg/cm2, the membrane showed an increase of dye rejection from 45.52
to 100%. Meanwhile, the pure water permeance showed a slight decrease
from 141.5 to 129.5 LMH/bar. The separation performance of the membrane,
i.e., permeability and retention, was mainly dependent on the membrane
material mass retained on the substrate surface.54 Therefore, the separation performance was correlated to
the specific MoS2 loading. The three atomic layers of MoS2 nanosheet structure would create rigid nanochannels with
stable interlaminar dimensions formed by overlapped MoS2 nanosheets, which could serve as the fluidic nanochannels for molecule
separation through avoiding water channels from being further compacted
under pressure.26 The lack of functional
groups has endowed MoS2 nanosheets with low hydraulic resistance
and smooth surface for water transportation.29 Furthermore, the smaller lateral dimensions of the exfoliated MoS2 in this work, which caused a relatively high porosity of
the MoS2 layer, have effectively shortened the pathway
for water transportation.26,44 With the increase of
MoS2 loading, more MoS2 nanosheets were deposited
on the membrane substrate, thus extending the water transport paths
leading to the decrease of permeance and increase of dye rejection,
known as the trade-off effect between these two properties.49 Therefore, by controlling the specific MoS2 nanosheet loading, it could meet different requirements of
performance. When the MoS2 loading was 0.1103 mg/cm2, the membrane exhibited high nanofiltration performance with
a pure water permeance of 135.3 LMH/bar, and the rejection toward
methylene blue (MB) was 100%.

MoS2 loadings.

2.3.2 Effect of Dopamine Polymerization Time
The effect of
dopamine polymerization time on dye rejection and pure water permeance
was also investigated. As shown in Figure 9, the dye rejection of the membrane toward
MB slightly increased at first and then kept nearly 100% with the
increase of dopamine polymerization time. It could be explained by
that MoS2 played a dominant role in dye rejection, and
the following deposition of PDA further inhibited the penetration
of dyes. The water permeance increased in the first stage and then
decreased with the increase of dopamine polymerization time, which
was mainly ascribed to the change of the PDA polymerization layer.

Figure 9 Nanofiltration performance of PDA(X)/MoS2(0.1103) NFMs at different dopamine polymerization times.

As shown in Figure 4, with more and more PDA deposited, a complete PDA modification layer
was formed and the membrane hydrophilicity was enhanced, which led
to the increase of water permeance.35,37 However, with
the dopamine polymerization time prolonged further, the PDA nanoaggregates
could be generated to block some passages of water transportation
and the PDA modification layer also turned too dense and thick, thereby
correspondingly decreasing the water permeance.51 But even at 6 h, the permeance of PDA(6)/MoS2 NFM was still higher than that of the MoS2 NFM without
PDA modification because of the increased hydrophilicity. The synergy
of MoS2 nanosheets and PDA modification has contributed
to the high permeability of PDA/MoS2 NFMs.

2.3.3 Antifouling Property
Antifouling property influences not only the separation performance
but also the stability of membranes. Foulants could be adsorbed on
the surface of membranes via hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interaction
to form a filter cake, causing the decrease of permeance. However,
with the filter cake being rinsed off, the flux could be recovered
during the washing process.55 Thus, the
antifouling property is an important property of membranes. In this
work, the antifouling behavior of the membranes was evaluated by four
fouling parameters (flux recovery ratio (FRR), total flux decline
ratio (DRt), reversible flux decline ratio (DRr), and irreversible flux decline ratio (DRir)) using bovine
serum albumin (BSA) as model foulant. As we all know, the lower DRt and higher FRR values mean more excellent antifouling characteristic
of the membrane. For the PDA/MoS2 NFMs, the layer-stacked
MoS2 nanosheets acted as a barrier and repelled the BSA
molecules from the surface layers.56 And
the absence of conjugated structure in MoS2 could avoid
the cation−π and π–π interactions
with organic fouling.29 As shown in Figure 10, with the extension
of polymerization time, the FRR increased and the DRt decreased,
which revealed that PDA modification could enhance the antifouling
property of the membrane by decreasing BSA adhesion due to the high
hydrophilicity, which could form a hydration layer, and the negative
charge, which could reduce the adhesion of BSA with negative charge
at neutral to alkaline pH through electrostatic repulsion.6,37 As shown in Figure 10, the membrane showed better antifouling performance at 6 h; therefore,
if there is a higher requirement for antifouling performance, the
polymerization time of 6 h is a good choice at the cost of longer
preparation time and lower water permeance.

indexes of PDA(X)/MoS2(0.1103) NFMs at
different dopamine polymerization
times.

2.3.4 Rejection Performance
The retention
performance of the PDA/MoS2 NFM was characterized through
MWCO measurements using the widely used neutral molecule poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG). The MWCO was defined as the molecular weight of PEG
at 90% rejection.57 As shown in Figure 11, the MWCO was
estimated to be 671 Da, which was in accordance with the typical nanofiltration
characteristic. As calculated by eq 3, the average transport path size of the PDA/MoS2 NFM was estimated to be ∼0.96 nm.

Figure 11 Rejection
of PDA(4)/MoS2(0.1103) NFM toward different molecular weights
of PEG.

Five kinds
of dyes with varying molecular weights and charges were employed to
explore the separation mechanism of PDA(4)/MoS2(0.1103)
NFM. The positively charged dyes are MB and crystal violet (CV), while
the negatively charged dyes are methyl orange (MO) and acid fuchsin
(AF), and the rhodamine B (RhB) is electroneutral. According to the
extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek theory,
the van der Waals attraction between MoS2 nanosheets is
greater than hydration force and electrostatic repulsion, so the swelling
degree of MoS2 layer is limited in water. And the maximum
interlayer spacing of the fully hydrated MoS2 nanosheets
could reach ∼1.2 nm.26 However,
the kinetic diameter of dye molecules was generally greater than 1.1
nm.58 This makes it possible for the MoS2 nanofiltration membrane to obtain a high rejection for dye
molecules.

As shown in Figure 12, the rejection toward dyes with the same electronegativity
and higher molecular weights was higher, and the rejection toward
RhB was as high as 97%, indicating that the steric hindrance effect
played an important role in dye rejection. Because the dye molecules
could be inclined to aggregate into some larger molecules via hydrophobic
interaction or intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the solution, the
actual size of dye molecules in the solution could be larger than
theoretical values.45 So, the dye rejection
was usually higher than the result from MWCO. The surface of PDA/MoS2 NFM was negatively charged (Figure 5).26,45 Thereby, except size
exclusion, the capability of removing MO and AF was also contributed
by the Donnan effect. The rejection toward MB and CV was higher than
that of AF, due to the possible physical adsorption of dyes with positive
charge onto the negatively charged membrane surface. So, the steric
hindrance effect and electrostatic effect worked together for the
rejection toward dyes.

Figure 12 Rejection
of PDA(4)/MoS2(0.1103) NFM toward different dyes.

The salt rejection of the PDA/MoS2 NFM is shown in Figure 13. The salt rejection was generally below 20%, which
was obviously lower than the dye rejection. The contrast was partially
due to the aggregation of dye molecules mentioned above. Furthermore,
the inorganic MoS2 layers created rigid nanochannels, which
could effectively reject the dye molecules with a large kinetic diameter
and infiltrate the salt ions with a relatively lower kinetic diameter.58 The rejection toward MgSO4 and Na2SO4 was apparently higher than the rejection toward
MgCl2 and NaCl, which was mainly ascribed to the Donnan
effect on the negatively charged surface, which was consistent with
the result of the ζ-potential measurement. And because of the
steric hindrance effect, the MgSO4 and MgCl2 retentions were higher than those of Na2SO4 and NaCl.

Figure 13 Rejection
of PDA(4)/MoS2(0.1103) NFM toward different salt solutions.

2.3.5 Long-Term Stability
The PDA(4)/MoS2(0.1103) NFM
was chosen as a representative to operate dye (MB) solution for 168
h for the long-term stability test. The flux and rejection toward
MB were tested every 12 h by the methods mentioned above. Finally, P/P0 (permeance) and R/R0 (rejection) were used to
express the results of long-term stability.45 From Figure 14,
both permeance and rejection showed a slight fluctuation during the
long-term stability testing process. This result indicated the high
structural stability of PDA(4)/MoS2(0.1103) NFM. This could
be on account of the excellent stability of MoS2 and PDA.
MoS2 nanosheets possessed antiswelling and rigid nanochannel
structure, which contributed to the stability of MoS2 layer-stacked
structure during the long-term water filtration process.26,29 The PDA with the property of inherently strong adhesion also provided
a stable modification layer for the NFMs.45

2.3.6 Comparison
The separation performance of the as-prepared membrane was compared
to that of other state-of-the-art nanofiltration membranes. As shown
in Table 1, the PDA(4)/MoS2(0.1103) membrane in this study showed a superior separation
performance with high pure water permeance and high dye rejection.

3 Conclusions
A novel PDA/MoS2 NFM was fabricated via self-assembly
of MoS2 nanosheets followed by PDA modification. The membrane
was composed of a uniform MoS2 layer and a PDA layer coated
on the HPAN substrate. The separation performance of PDA/MoS2 NFMs with various MoS2 loadings and dopamine polymerization
times was investigated. With the increase of MoS2 loading,
the dye rejection increased and the water permeance decreased. The
smooth surface and rigid nanochannels of the exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets endowed the membrane with high water permeance and dye
rejection. And the PDA modification effectively enhanced the membrane
hydrophilicity, thus increasing the water permeance, and the dye rejection
also slightly increased. Furthermore, the antifouling property of
the membrane for BSA was also satisfactory with a high flux recovery
ratio and a low total fouling ratio due to the increase of hydrophilicity
and the electrostatic repulsion. And profited from the stability of
MoS2 nanosheets and inherently strong adhesion of PDA,
the PDA/MoS2 NFM also exhibited a satisfactory long-term
stability. The pure water permeance of PDA(4)/MoS2(0.1103)
NFM was 135.3 LMH/bar, and the rejection toward MB was 100%. The developed
membrane also maintained high rejection toward various kinds of dyes
(MB, CV, MO, RhB, and AF) and high permeability of salts (MgSO4, MgCl2, Na2SO4, and NaCl)
with the molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 671 Da. This work provided
a method to fabricate and modify MoS2 membranes for high-performance
nanofiltration process.

Water used in this work was ultrapure water prepared by reverse osmosis.

4.2 Exfoliation of Multilayered
MoS2
The 2D MoS2 nanosheets were prepared
by a mixed-solvent mechanical exfoliation strategy.40,64 First,
10 mL of ethanol/water with an ethanol volume fraction of 45% as dispersion
solvent was added into a 15 mL pressure flask with 30 mg of MoS2 powder. The dispersion was treated by ultrasound (QT3120,
Ruipu, China) under 120 W for 8 h. Subsequently, the obtained dispersion
was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min for removing multilayer MoS2. Then, the supernatant was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm
for 10 min to obtain exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets followed
by drying in vacuum.

4.3 Preparation of PDA-Modified MoS2 NFMs
Figure 15 shows the preparation
process of the PDA-modified MoS2 NFMs. First, circular
pieces with 6 cm diameter of PAN substrate membranes were hydrolyzed
in NaOH (1.5 M) for 60 min at 50 °C. Then, the membranes were
rinsed by ultrapure water to obtain hydrolyzed PAN (HPAN) followed
by storing in ultrapure water until use.

Figure 15 Schematic of the preparation process of PDA/MoS2 NFMs.

For the loading of
MoS2, the HPAN substrate was first mounted at the bottom
of an Amicon cell (Millipore, Billerica, MA), which was connected
to a nitrogen gas cylinder, to form a pressurized membrane filtration
system. Then, MoS2 nanosheet suspension with a certain
concentration was filtrated through the HPAN substrate under a pressure
of 1–2 bar. The loading of MoS2 was controlled by
varying the volume of filtrated MoS2 nanosheet suspension.

Next, for preparing dopamine coating solution, 80 mg of dopamine
hydrochloride was dissolved in 40 mL of Tris–HCl buffer solution
(50 mM, pH 8.5). Subsequently, the freshly prepared dopamine coating
solution was poured into the Amicon cell loaded with MoS2 membranes for a certain period. In the end, the membranes were rinsed
with ultrapure water several times and stored in it.

The as-prepared
PDA-modified MoS2 NFMs were named PDA(X)/MoS2(Y) NFMs, where X is the polymerization time of dopamine (h) and Y is the loading of MoS2 (mg/cm2).

4.4 Characterization
4.4.1 Exfoliated MoS2 Characterization
The morphologies of exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets were investigated by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analysis conducted with a JEM-2100 microscope. The thickness
of exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets was measured by atomic force
microscopy (AFM, BioScope Catalyst, Bruker, Germany) on a mica plate.
The samples for all analyses were dispersed in ethanol with the help
of ultrasound.

4.4.2 Membrane Characterization
The surface and cross-sectional
morphologies of the PDA/MoS2 NFMs were observed utilizing
scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova Nano SEM450 field emission
microscope with an accelerating voltage of 10 KV). AFM was employed
to examine the morphological changes of the membrane surface at difference
dopamine polymerization times. The hydrophilicity of the membrane
surface was investigated by water contact angle using a DAS30 video
contact angle system (KRUSS, Germany). The chemical structure of the
membranes was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry
(FT-IR, VERTEX 70, Bruker, Germany). The transmittance spectra were
collected in the wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm–1. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of MoS2 NFMs and
PDA/MoS2 NFMs were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer
(D8 Discover, BRUKER AXS GMBH, Germany) with a Cu Kα anode (λ
= 0.15438 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. And the ζ-potential of the
surface of PDA/MoS2 NFM was determined by an electrokinetic
analyzer (SurPASS, Anton Paar, AUS) in the pH range of 3–10
controlled by adding a certain amount of NaOH (0.1 M) or HCl (0.1
M) solution.

4.5 Membrane Flux and Rejection Tests
The nanofiltration performance
in terms of pure water permeance and dye rejection was evaluated using
a pressurized membrane filtration system with an Amicon cell under
a certain pressure. The membrane sample with an effective area of
28.274 cm2 was precompacted with ultrapure water for 0.5
h at 2 bar to obtain a steady permeance before performance evaluation.
The pure water permeance (J, L m–2 h–1 bar–1, abbreviated as LMH/bar)
was tested at 1 bar using ultrapure water as the feed. Various salt
and dye solutions were used to evaluate the rejection (R, %) of the membrane. The concentrations of salt and dye solution
were evaluated, respectively, by an electrical conductivity meter
(DDSJ-308A, Rex, CHN) and a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-1100,
Mapada, China). The pure water permeance and rejection were calculated
according to the following equations, respectively 1  where V is the total volume
(L) of permeate pure water collected in a certain time t (h), and A (m2) and P (bar) represent the effective membrane area and operation pressure,
respectively 2  where Cf and Cp are the solute concentrations
(mg/L) of feed and permeate solutions, respectively.

Furthermore,
a series of PEG solutions with molecular weights ranging from 200
to 1000 Da were used as feed solution to test the MWCO of the as-prepared
membrane. According to the following equation, the Stokes radius (rs) of PEG molecule could be calculated65 3  where MW is the molecular weight of PEG.

4.6 Antifouling Property
BSA solution (500
mg/L) was used as the foulant to evaluate the antifouling property
of the membrane carried on the same pressurized membrane filtration
system with Amicon cell at 1 bar. The membrane sample was initially
pressurized with ultrapure water for 0.5 h to ensure the membrane
reaching a steady state, and the pure water permeance (P0) was measured. Then, by BSA solution replacing the ultrapure
water, the foulant solution permeance (P1) was measured after 120 min and filtrated through the membrane in
Amicon cell. Finally, the ultrapure water was filtrated through the
membrane for 0.5 h to wash the membrane. The following pure water
permeance (P2) was measured. The total
flux recovery ratio (FRR), the total flux decline ratio (DRt), the reversible flux decline ratio (DRr), and the irreversible
flux decline ratio (DRir), the antifouling characteristics
of the membrane, were calculated according to the following equations,
respectively 4   5   6   7
