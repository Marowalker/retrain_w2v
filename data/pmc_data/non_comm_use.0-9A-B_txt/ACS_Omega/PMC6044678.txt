The
fluorescence intermittency or “blinking” of single
molecules of ATTO647N (ATTO) in the conductive matrix polyvinylcarbazole
(PVK) is described in the presence of an external applied electric
field. It is shown that due to the energy distribution of the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of PVK, which is energetically
close to the HOMO of ATTO, sporadic electron transfer occurs. As a
result, the on/off dynamics of blinking can be influenced by the electric
field. This field will, depending on the respective position and orientation
of the dye/polymer system with respect to those of the electrodes,
either enhance or suppress electron transfer from PVK to ATTO as well
as the back electron transfer from reduced ATTO to PVK. After the
charge-transfer step, the applied field will pull the hole in PVK
away from the dye, increasing the overall time the dye resides in
a dark state.

Introduction
The fluorescence of
a bulk sample containing many fluorophores
shows, in the absence of bleaching, a constant fluorescence intensity
upon continuous illumination. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity
of individual molecules with time is nearly always fluctuating, a
phenomenon called blinking or fluorescence intermittency.1−6 Hence, the fluorescence intensity of an individual molecule measured
as a function of time alternates between the so-called on and off
states over a wide range of time scales (from microseconds to milliseconds
and longer). This blinking can be attributed to diverse processes
like intersystem crossing to a nonemissive triplet state,3,7,8 spectral diffusion,9,10 conformational changes,11−13 molecular reorientation,14,15 and inter- or intra-molecular charge transfer.16−23 Blinking has been observed for virtually any emitting material,
including quantum dots,4,24,25 conjugated polymers,26−28 organic dyes,3,7,29,30 fluorescent proteins,31−35 and recently also perovskite nanocrystals.36−38 Whereas the
shorter off times in the micro- and milli-second ranges are usually
attributed to intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold, the longer
off times are attributed to charge transfer (usually electrons, but
eventually also proton transfer in the case of fluorescent proteins)
from or to the surroundings.1,5,21 It was noticed, first for quantum dots and later also for dyes,
that the distribution of these on and off times for a single particle/molecule
(or the average distributions of several single emitters) follows
so-called inversed power laws, pτ ∼ τ–μ, that span time scales
of several orders of magnitude.3,4,39,40 For the exponents, μ values
between 1.5 and 2.2 are generally found, although larger values have
also been reported.39 It was shown that
the off exponents are highly dependent on the dielectric constant
of the medium, in contrast to the on exponents, which show an exponential
cutoff with increasing dielectric constant. These dependencies suggest
that a photoejected charge is self-trapped in the surroundings. The
current model to explain these power laws, presented by Orrit et al.,5,39 proposes a four-level system, in which a charge transfer to the
surroundings occurs with the formation of charge-separated radical
ions. As long as no back charge transfer leading to recombination
takes place, the molecule will remain in a dark state. For rhodamine
6G in poly(vinylalcohol), electron paramagnetic resonance experiments
confirmed the existence of the radical anion of the dye in the dye/matrix
system.5 Summarizing, trapping and detrapping
processes linked to charge transfer are at the core of blinking over
long time scales. We postulate that when this model is valid the use
of a conductive polymer matrix enables the fate of the photogenerated
charges to be influenced by applying an external electric field.

Several studies on the blinking dynamics under the influence of
an electric field have been performed. Most of these studies focused
on single conjugated polymer chains embedded in an inert matrix. De
Schryver reported fluorescence quenching in the presence of an electric
field due to (photo)injected polarons.27 Scheblykin reported on the fluorescence quenching of single polymer
poly [2-methoxy, 5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-p-phenylene-vinylene]
(MEH-PPV) molecules. This quenching in the presence of an electric
field was attributed to the formation of long-living charge-separated
species due to charge transfer either between different segments of
the same polymer chain or with the involvement of impurities.41 In a follow-up study, it was shown that the
electric field influences not only the equilibrium between the neutral
and charged chains but also the movement of the charge on the polymer
chain with respect to the orientation of the field.42 Barbara et al. revealed a great deal on the mechanism of
polaron-induced quenching in device-like configurations of single
polymer chains.43,44 Chen et al. probed
the electric-field induced polarization and relaxation dynamics of
a PMMA matrix by monitoring the fluorescence intensity response of
single squarine dyes embedded into the matrix in their study.45

These studies were performed with either
isolated conductive polymer
chains or single dye molecules embedded in a nonconductive matrix,
leading to deep qualitative insight and understanding. However, for
example, for dye molecules embedded in an inert matrix, the nature
and hence energy levels of the electron donors and (more likely) acceptors
that interact with the dye creating an “off” state are
not known. This makes it very difficult to discuss the blinking phenomenon
and its electric-field dependence in a more quantitative manner. Using
an already extensively investigated conductive matrix will allow for
a semiquantitative analysis in the framework of Marcus theory and
take into account bulk observable parameters, such as disorder, and
the energy levels (highest occupied molecular orbital/highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO/LUMO)) of the used polymer.

To test
the aforementioned hypothesis of long-time-scale blinking,
we used here a combination of dye ATTO647N (ATTO) and conductive polymer
polyvinylcarbazole (PVK). Taking into account the excitation energy
of ATTO1,29 and the oxidation and reduction potentials
of PVK46 and ATTO, it is expected that
“reductive” electron transfer (or hole transfer) is
energetically possible by a small margin. In such a reductive electron
transfer process, an electron from the HOMO of PVK will be transferred
to the HOMO of an excited ATTO molecule. Although ATTO is surrounded
by several carbazole moieties, just one of these will be more favorable
for electron transfer than the others, considering the energy level,
distance, and orientation with respect to the dye. After the electron
transfer, the hole on PVK can either recombine in a nanosecond-to-microsecond
time scale with the electron on ATTO or execute a “random walk”
in the PVK matrix,47 during which it can
be trapped. In the latter case, this will result in a dark state that
persists until back electron transfer occurs. It is important to understand
that although PVK is considered a hole-conducting material this mobility
is still as low as ∼10–5 cm2/V
s at reasonable applied fields (∼300 kV/cm), so the extent
of this random walk will be limited.

A conductive polymer cannot
be accurately characterized by a single
value for its HOMO and LUMO. To account for the observable charge
mobilities, the disordered nature of these materials needs to be taken
into account. According to the disorder model,48 the carrier mobility in a disordered amorphous material,
including polymers, is governed by “diagonal” and “off-diagonal”
disorders. Diagonal disorder is related to the distribution of the
energy levels of the charge-carrier transport sites. This distribution
can be described by the density of states (DOS) of the carrier transport
sites in the polymer (DOS) and will, in most cases, lead to a Pool–Frenkel
type behavior, that is, increased charge mobility with increasing
electric field. Off-diagonal disorder can be related to the distribution
of intermolecular distances and orientations. These will lead to a
distribution of the orbital overlap between neighboring molecules
and hence of the interaction energies between the HOMO’s and
the LUMO’s of neighboring transport sites (off-diagonal elements
of the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian).

Because of the DOS
at the energy level of the HOMO of PVK (see Figure 1), one can expect
that for only a small fraction of the ATTO–carbazole pairs
electron transfer is thermodynamically favorable. When applying an
external electric field, several hypothetic scenarios can be expected:
(1) an electric field pointing from ATTO to PVK will make the electron
transfer on average less endergonic by making the energy difference
between the center of the DOS of ATTO and that of PVK smaller. This
will increase the rate constant and hence the probability of electron
transfer from PVK to the excited ATTO and result in shorter on times.
Considering that the electron transfer can also be followed by very
fast recombination not leading to an observable off period, one can
expect that for this particular situation that the electric field
will reduce the average intensity during an “on” period.
(2) An electric field pointing from PVK to ATTO will make the electron
transfer on average more endergonic by making the energy difference
between the center of the DOS of ATTO and that of PVK larger. The
probability of electron transfer from PVK to ATTO decreases resulting
in longer on times. Considering that the electron transfer can also
be followed by very fast recombination not leading to an off period,
one can expect that for these systems the electric field will enhance
the average intensity during an on period. (3) The electric field
pointing from ATTO to PVK will keep the separated charges apart longer
and promote hole transport in PVK. This effect will result in longer
off times, whereas the on times remain constant. Hence, the on times
will be directly related to the DOS and thus diagonal disorder. The
off times on the other hand will be related to the general transport
properties of the polymer, both off-diagonal and diagonal disorder.

an electric field. The blue arrow indicates the influence of the applied
electric field on the HOMO levels.

Methods
Device
Cover slides with a 20 nm patterned layer of
indium tin oxide (ITO) and a 150 nm insulating layer of SiO2 (ECI Evaporated Coatings Inc.) were ultrasonically cleaned. A solution
of 20 mg/mL of PVK in chlorobenzene with 10–9 M
ATTO was spin cast under an inert atmosphere at 1000 rpm for 60 s
on top of this substrate, and an aluminum layer of 150 nm was evaporated
on top of this film. The film thickness was determined via the capacitance
and amounted to 150 nm.

Confocal Microscopy
The excitation
source was the 632.8
nm line of a continuous wave HeNe laser (Thorlabs HNL150R/HRS015).
The fluorescence above 640 nm was split via an 80:20 beam splitter
and directed, respectively, to an avalanche photodiode to measure
the intensity trajectories and to a nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled
device (CCD) (Princeton Instruments SPEC-10:100B/LN eXcelon CCD camera,
SP 2356 spectrometer with 1-030-500 grating 300 g/mm @ 500 nm) to
subsequently measure single-molecule (SM) spectra, to discriminate
between emission of ATTO and that of impurities in the PVK matrix.
The fluorescence was passed through appropriate filters to suppress
the excitation beam.49,50 Both the binning and threshold
method51 and second-order autocorrelation
method10,52 were used to analyze the blinking behavior
of the samples. For the first method, we used a binning time of 1
ms. The threshold was determined as the lowest possible value for
which the background signal did not result in any off times. As a
control, several SMs of ATTO (20) were measured in a polystyrene matrix
using the same device configuration. No influence of the electric
field on the fluorescence intensity was observed (Figure S1).

Results and Discussion
The devices
were placed on a confocal microscope with SM detection
sensitivity. The fluorescence intensity of single ATTO molecules was
measured in the absence of an applied bias voltage and while applying
a bias of 20 V (E = 667 kV cm–1) over the device every 10 s for 5 s. SM emission spectra were measured
to make sure that the intensity changes observed upon applying an
electric field were not due to a Stark shift or to a conformational
reorganization of the dye molecules. Both processes would lead to
changes in the emission spectrum: a change in the features or shift
of the position, respectively. The obtained traces (126 molecules
measured in total) can be divided into four populations depending
on how the fluorescence of the SMs responded to the application of
the electric field. An example of a representative molecule of each
population is shown in Figure 2. Population A comprises SMs for which the fluorescence intensity
does not show a clear dependence on the electric field (41% of the
measured molecules) (Figure 2A). Population B comprises SMs that showed a reduced intensity
when the electric field is on (47%) (Figure 2B). Population C consists of molecules that
showed the exact opposite behavior, that is, their fluorescence intensity
is enhanced by the electric field (9%) (Figure 2C). SMs of which the emission was almost
completely suppressed upon applying an electric field make up the
fourth type of field-dependent behavior (3%) (Figure 2D) in population D.

Figure 2 Representative examples
of the four types of field-dependent SM
fluorescence traces obtained during repeated application of a 20 V
potential across the device. Population A: the electric field has
no effect on the fluorescence intensity, population B: the electric
field reduced the fluorescence intensity, population C: the fluorescence
intensity is enhanced by the electric field, and population D: the
fluorescence intensity is almost completely suppressed by the electric
field.

The recorded traces can be analyzed
with either the binning and
thresholding (B&T) technique or the autocorrelation method. However,
because of the limited number of observations per cycle of the applied
electric field, the B&T method was deemed less suitable when quantitative
data analysis per cycle was aimed for. Nevertheless, when combining
the obtained on (or off) times (obtained with the B&T method)
of several individual molecules, a clear power-law was observed for
both the on and off times (data not shown, see Supporting Information, Figures S2 and S3). To analyze and compare the
on and off times of each electric-field cycle, we opted for the autocorrelation
method. For each cycle (period of 0 V and period of 20 V), the second-order
autocorrelation functions of the intensity are calculated. This was
also done for the pure PVK matrix to ensure that no unexpected correlations
showed up. This second-order autocorrelation function (gt′(2)) is constructed
using the following equation  I(t) is
the fluorescence intensity measured in the integration interval centered
at time t. These autocorrelation functions are fitted
to a single exponential with decay time τac and amplitude A. This allows one to calculate the average on (τon) and off times (τoff) using the following
equations  It has been shown that
for molecules undergoing
intersystem crossing these on and off times are related to triplet
dynamics.3,7,8,52−54 Likewise, when electron or hole
transfer is possible between the excited dye and the matrix, the off
times can be related to the rate constant of charge recombination, krec.  The on times
will be a function of the rate
constant for excitation, the probability for excited-state electron
transfer and the probability for geminate ion pair separation  ket is the rate
constant for forward electron transfer, whereas kfluor, kisc, and kic are the rate constants for fluorescence, intersystem
crossing, and internal conversion of the ATTO dye. kexc is the rate constant for excitation. The latter should
be related to the excitation intensity and ground-state absorption
cross section of ATTO. φsep is the probability that
a hole generated on a carbazole next to an ATTO molecule will escape
recombination. Holes that fail to do so will recombine with the electron
on the dye molecule on a nanosecond time scale and hence will not
be able to create a dark state with a lifetime of micro- or milli-seconds.
A simplified picture of the electron dynamics is given in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Jablonski Diagram
for Photoinduced Electron Transfer from Carbazole
to ATTO*
After the photoinduced
electron transfer, the probability for the
electron on the ATTO molecule to hop to other dye molecules is extremely
low as they are present at SM concentration. This electron can also
not be injected in the LUMO of the carbazole moieties as the energy
of the LUMO of carbazole (2.2 eV) is much higher than that of ATTO.
However, the hole created on a carbazole in contact with ATTO can
start to hop to neighboring carbazoles with rate constant kdiss and will execute a random walk on the carbazole
moieties47,55 in the field of the net negative charge
on the ATTO (due to the negative charge of the ATTO counterion).

Eventually, the hole ends up on a carbazole in contact with the
reduced ATTO (with rate constant k–diss) where recombination with the electron on ATTO can occur with rate
constant kbet and kbet′ (see Scheme 1). If the time dependence
of kdiss and k–diss(56−58) is neglected, then φsep will be given by  In this framework krec will be given
by  ket, kbet, kbet′, kdis,
and k–diss will all depend on the
applied electric field. According to the classical Marcus theory,59−63 the rate constant for (back) electron transfer can be given by  where κET is the electronic
transmission factor (∼1 for adiabatic ET, ≪1 for nonadiabatic
ET), h is the Planck constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the
temperature, ΔG° is the standard Gibbs
free energy change (in electronvolts), and λ is the reorganization
energy (in electronvolts). For reductive electron transfer, ΔGet° is given by the Rehm–Weller equation64,65  ED°+/D° (0.74
eV vs ferrocene46,66) is the oxidation potential of
the PVK film, as determined by cyclic
voltammetry, EA/A°–° (−1.25 eV vs ferrocene) is the reduction potential
of ATTO as determined by cyclic voltammetry (see Figure S4), and ΔE00 is
the excitation energy (1.96 eV) of ATTO (0–0 absorption in
film). In this way, a value of +0.03 eV is obtained for ΔGet°. In the same way, ΔGbet° and ΔGb′et° are given by  and  ΔET is the
triplet energy of ATTO, ED°+/D° of PVK and EA/A°–° of ATTO were determined in
solution where, due to the rapid motion of the solvent molecules,
all carbazole and ATTO moieties have an identical time-averaged environment.
The redox processes we are interested in, however, occur in a rigid
and largely amorphous and disordered polymer matrix. This means that
all carbazole and ATTO moieties have a different local environment
characterized by different van der Waals, dipole–dipole, ion–dipole,
and π−π interactions.48,67−71 As in a film, conformational changes are slow compared to the excited-state
decay time; the oxidation potential (or the position of the HOMO level)
of the carbazole molecules and the reduction potential (or the position
of the LUMO level) of the ATTO moieties will be given by a distribution
function. Hence, rather than being characterized by a single value,
the values of ΔGet° will also be given by a distribution
and different molecules of ATTO will experience a different value
of ΔGet°. In a first approximation, this distribution
can be considered as a Gaussian distribution of the DOS.48,67,70 Besides the factors mentioned
above, the energy of HOMO of carbazole will be governed by the overlap
of neighboring carbazole moieties, which depends on the conformation
of the chain segments linking neighboring carbazole moieties.72−74

In the framework of the model developed for charge transport
in
amorphous materials,48,67,70 the width of the Gaussian distribution of the HOMO level can be
determined from the field and temperature dependence of the hole mobility,
which was determined using the “Time of Flight” method
(TOF)75,76 (see Figures S5 and S6). In this way, a value of 129 meV was obtained for the standard
deviation associated with the Gaussian distribution of DOS of the
HOMO level (see Figure S6 and Table S1).
This value is comparable with results reported in the literature.77 As described in the Introduction, applying an electric field can change the energy difference between
the ATTO HOMO and the PVK HOMO. Hence, also the difference ED°+/D° – EA/A°–° –
ΔE00 will be altered by −E⃗ * r⃗, where E⃗ is the applied field and r⃗, a vector with
the origin in the center of the ATTO molecule and oriented to that
of the carbazole unit responsible for the electron transfer. This
vector product is illustrated in Figure 4 for populations B and C. This figure also
serves as a summary of the general observations and given explanations
related to these populations. Assuming a homogeneous field (667 kV
cm–1) and an average distance of 0.5 nm between
the center of the molecules involved, this difference spans a range
from 0.033 to −0.033 eV, depending on the orientation of the
vector r⃗ relative to E⃗. Hence, the electric field will increase or decrease ΔGet° by a value between 0 and 0.033 eV. As the absolute value of ΔGet° will always be small compared to λ (typically 0.4–2
eV), ΔGet≠ will be changed by values between 0.0165
and −0.0165 eV. This will increase or decrease the rate constant
for the electron transfer between PVK and the excited ATTO by a factor
between 1 and 1.9. Therefore, the quenching (through electron transfer)
will be enhanced for some ATTO molecules and prohibited for others.
Furthermore, after the initial charge-separation step, the hole injected
into the carbazole will start diffusing over the PVK moieties in the
field of the counterion of ATTO and, due to this field, eventually
recombine with the electron in the LUMO of the ATTO molecule. Depending
on the relative orientation of the ATTO and the carbazole moiety with
respect to the applied field, the applied field can enhance or hinder
the diffusion of the hole toward the reduced ATTO molecule, speeding
up or slowing down the regeneration of a fluorescent ATTO molecule.
With this framework laid out, we will now step-by-step consider each
population of molecules.

Population A
These are the individual
ATTO molecules
where the electric field does not affect the fluorescence intensity
(Figure 2A). There
is no observable influence of the electric field on the blinking dynamics
as well; both on and off times remain constant through out the entire
trace. Therefore, there is no evidence of electron transfer (ket ≪ kisc + kf + kic) followed by hole hopping (kdiss ≪ k–diss) taking place and the system can
be described by a simple three level system where blinking is, for
example, caused by intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold. Typical
off times are several 100 μs, which corresponds to triplet associated
off times reported in literature.4 Indeed,
for most ATTO–PVK pairs the initial ΔGet≠ will
be unsuitable for efficient electron transfer. The possible increase
in ΔGet≠ due to the electric field (max 0.0165
eV) will not compensate this for all molecules and depending on the
vector −E⃗ * r⃗ even further impair this process. Although an orientation of the
ATTO–PVK pair perpendicular to the electric field would also
result in a ket that is independent of
this electric field, an effect on the hole hopping (kdiss) is nevertheless expected as this will usually be
in the direction of the field. Therefore, it is more reasonable to
conclude that for this class of molecules no electron transfer takes
place. Indeed, Scheblykin et al. demonstrated a low enhancement factor
for charge separation due to an electric field for isolated MEH-PPV
molecules in a nonconducting polymer. Even close to a hole-conducting
layer, Barbara et al. observed no signs of efficient exciton dissociation
for most molecules.

Population D
The class of molecules
belonging to trace
D in Figure 2, the
molecules where the fluorescence is completely quenched, is the opposite
extreme case. Here, it is intuitive to assume that the electric field
enhances both the electron transfer step (ket ≫ kisc + kf) and the hole hopping. The hole hops away from the ATTO molecule
under the influence of the applied electric field and most likely
becomes trapped, leaving behind a dark ATTO radical. Although the
fluorescence intensity is almost completely suppressed when the electric
field is on, some fluorescence spikes occasionally occur. When the
fluorescence is completely quenched, no autocorrelation functions
can be analyzed, yet for the spikes it remains possible to obtain
and analyze the autocorrelation function. For the specific trace in Figure 2D, the duration of
the on times remained constant when comparing these spikes to the
situation where the electric field is off. Hence, the electron transfer
step itself is not influenced, but the field is strong enough to prevent
the hole to recombine with a reduced ATTO molecule most of the time.
Holes most likely end up in a deep trap being somewhere in the vicinity.
Occasionally, the hole escapes this trap and has a chance of recombining.
This will be described more in detail in section Subclass B3.

Population B
Next, the intermediate
situation, where
the electric field suppresses the fluorescence intensity of the ATTO
dye (Figure 2B) is
considered. The autocorrelation traces for trace B are depicted in Figure 3, and the corresponding
calculated on and off times are shown in Table 1 (subclass B1). When comparing the on and
off times without and with electric field, the molecules that show
a reduced intensity upon applying an electric field can be divided
into three subclasses (B1, B2, and B3).

traces of trace B (Figure 1).

and Off Times of

Subclass B1
The majority of the molecules show on times
that remain more or less constant, whereas the off times increase
significantly (Table 1, subclass B1). This means that the product of ketφsep does not change much, whereas krec is decreased. As generally the effect of
the applied field on kdiss or k–diss is larger than that on ket or kbet, the
observation that τon does not change significantly,
whereas τoff is increased suggests that the decrease
of k–diss by the applied field
is much larger than the increase of kdiss. This is no surprise as, initially, the electron and hole are still
close together and kdiss will correspond
to a transfer between two neighboring carbazole units. On the other
hand, the recombination process will involve holes that have moved
in a random way in several steps. If an electric field is applied,
then they will preferentially move in the direction of the field.
Hence, the process described by k–diss will correspond to a large number of hops (compared to kdiss), most of them opposite to the applied electric field.
Therefore, k–diss will be suppressed
by an applied field. The back electron transfer step kbet is very exergonic and will most often correspond to
an electron transfer opposite to the applied field. Applying an electric
field will make ΔGbet° less negative and will enhance kbet as ΔGbet° is in the
Marcus inverted region.62 Both the decrease
of k–diss and increase of kbet will lead to a decrease of krec and an increase of τoff. This means
that the applied electric field reduces the probability that the hole
recombines with the electron in ATTO. Furthermore, the observation
that for the largest group of molecules τon does
not change upon the application of an electric field means that for
this group also the efficiency of electron transfer, , and hence ΔGet° does not
change when an electric field is applied. This means that the orientation
of the vector r⃗ is close to perpendicular
to the applied field for the ATTO–PVK pair most favorable for
electron transfer (Figure 4, subclass B1). The probability that the
angle between the vector r⃗ and the applied
field is between θ and θ + dθ is given by sin θ dθ.
The probability that this angle is between π/4 and 3π/4
is 2–1/2 ≈ 0.7, whereas the probability that
this angle is between 0 and π/4 or between 3π/4 and π
is 1 – 2–1/2 ≈ 0.3. This means that
for most molecules θ is relatively close to π/2 and hence
ΔGet° and ket will
not be influenced to a large extent by the applied field. This allows
us to conclude that the observed field dependence of τon and τof is compatible with a model where charge
transfer and the formation of a long-lived charge-separated state,
which is stabilized by the applied field, are responsible for the
off times.

electric field, E⃗, vs the direction of photoinduced
electron transfer, r⃗, for the different types

C represents the off-diagonal disorder, which prevents hole hopping.

Subclass B2
A
second category of molecules with reduced
intensity in the presence of the electric field shows both longer
off times and longer on times (Table 1, subclass B2). One should note that these molecules
are characterized by off times that, in the absence of an applied
field, are much smaller than those of subclasses B1 and B3. The effect
of the applied field on the on and off times implies that the electric
field on one hand again keeps the charges separated longer due to
a decrease in k–diss and hence
of krec but, on the other hand, also delays
the electron transfer step ket. Here,
the PVK moiety close to the dye will most likely be located on the
ITO side of the device and hence the energy difference between the
HOMO of ATTO and that of PVK (ΔGet°) will become
larger (less negative or more positive) by −E⃗ * r⃗. Here, r⃗ is
now more or less opposite to the electric field (θ close to
π, Figure 4,
subclass B2). For this geometry, the first step in the dissociation
of the electron hole pairs by hopping of the holes over the carbazole
moieties (kdiss) cannot be in the direction
of the applied field as this would bring the hole back on ATTO (kbet or k′bet) and hence will not be enhanced effectively by the applied field.
Both effects will have as consequence that the product  is decreased and therefore
τon is increased. On the other hand, once the hole
escapes initial
recombination, it can travel a significant distance in the direction
of the field, allowing it to reach a position from which k–diss will be depressed strongly by the electric
field, leading to an increase in τoff. This later
effect seems to dominate. In its absence (for instance when using
a nonconductive polymer), one would expect an increase in the fluorescence
intensity when the electric field is on due to the observed increase
in τon.

Subclass B3
The third category of
reduced intensity
molecules also show longer off times but shorter on times (Table 1, subclass B3) in
the presence of the electric field. In contrast to previous subclasses,
the increase of the off times and also the decrease of the on times
are quite modest. Here, we infer that ket and/or φsep are increased. PVK moieties located
at the aluminum side of an ATTO possess a decreased relative energy
difference between their HOMO and that of ATTO (ΔGet° becomes
more negative or less positive) by (E⃗ * r⃗) (Figure 4, subclass B3) upon applying the electric field. The resulting
increased probability of electron transfer ket reduces the on times. Furthermore, in contrast to the previous
case, the first step in the dissociation of the electron hole pair
by hopping of the holes over the carbazole moieties (kdiss) is now possible in the direction of the field and
hence kdiss can be enhanced by the applied
field. Both factors will increase the product  and hence
reduce τon.
On the other hand, the electric field once again leads to a decrease
in k–diss and krec and therefore to shorter off times.

Population
C
Only a few molecules showed intensity
traces where the electric field enhances the fluorescence. Surprisingly,
the autocorrelation functions reveal that for every molecule that
shows enhanced fluorescence when the electric field is applied, the
off time decreases significantly, whereas only a minor change (increase
or decrease) in τon is observed. One possible way
to explain this is by assuming that k–diss increases significantly in the presence of the electric field, whereas kdiss is possibly decreased. The latter factor
will only play a significant role when kdiss is not small compared to kbet + k’bet. To understand this behavior, some
specific aspects of charge-carrier transport in amorphous materials
have to be considered.

As described in the Introduction, off-diagonal disorder can be related to the
orbital overlap between neighboring molecules. This overlap is proportional
with exp(−αL), where L is the distance between hopping sites and α is an attenuation
factor of the wavefunction. Because of the variation with L, some indirect paths characterized by a favorable overlap,
but involving steps against the direction of the applied field, can
be faster at low/zero field than the direct paths containing only
steps in the direction of the applied field. At larger fields, this
effect will saturate and become compensated by the effects of the
tilting of the DOS caused by the applied field (Pool–Frenkel
behavior).48 The subsequent saturation
of the hole mobility at low fields has been observed for PVK.48

As the off-diagonal disorder in PVK is
relatively large,60 one can expect, despite
the fact that this process
is supposed to be activationless,78 to
have a large distribution in the rate constants for hopping between
neighboring carbazoles where the hole jumps to a site lower in energy.
For hopping toward sites with higher energy, this distribution will
come on top of the distribution of the Boltzmann factors. It was shown
from the saturation of the charge-carrier mobility at low fields that
in systems with significant nondiagonal disorder the most advantageous
pathway involves states where the hole has to move in the opposite
direction to the applied field. Therefore, it is possible that the
hole of the initial electron hole pair hops in a direction opposite
to the applied field when it starts its random walk and gets trapped
in a poorly connected and/or deep lying transport site in a direction
opposite to that of the applied field. In Figure 4C, this trap and the off-diagonal disorder
is represented by the black line. In this case, the applied field
will tilt the DOS and enhance the escape of the carrier from the trap
by the Poole−Frenkel effect.79 This
will lead to an increase of k–diss and a consequent reduction of τoff upon increasing
the applied field. When the applied field has little or no influence
on τon while τoff is decreased,
it will enhance the fluorescence intensity. Although, in general,
one would expect that the fluorescence enhancement is mainly due to
a decreased rate of electron transfer, in our system the effect of
the field on hole hopping dominates the former and thus reduces the
fluorescence intensity for most observed molecules (populations B
and D as discussed earlier). In the specific case of population C,
the fluorescence enhancement finds its origin in the prevention of
hole hopping due to the presence of off-diagonal disorder.

Barbara
et al.44 provided an alternative
explanation for the enhancement of the fluorescence by an applied
field. In the system studied by Barbara et al., the off times correspond
to triplet excitons that are more easily quenched by holes (leading
again to an on-state) injected by the field than singlet excitons.
However, in our device, no holes generated by injection from the electrode
as noninjecting contacts are used. Furthermore, as PVK is not excited,
no holes can be created by field-assisted exciton dissociation of
PVK. Because of the very low concentration of ATTO used (singe molecule
conditions), the small number of holes created by quenching of ATTO
will not be able to influence the triplet decay time of ATTO.

Conclusions
The generally accepted model of blinking being caused by the formation
of a radical ion through charge transfer can be applied to understand
the blinking in the system ATTO/PVK. The redox potentials of both
ATTO and PVK are such that they allow sporadic photoinduced electron
transfer from PVK to the excited state of ATTO, leaving a hole, which
can execute a random walk in the PVK matrix, in the HOMO of PVK. As
PVK is a disordered material, one can expect that the energy of the
HOMO follows a distribution, the width of which is related to the
diagonal disorder, which can be represented by a DOS. The position
of the HOMO of PVK in this distribution versus that of ATTO dictates
the ease of the charge transfer step and hence is responsible for
the distribution of the observed on times. The conductive properties
and/or traps in PVK are responsible for the off times. The effect
of an applied electric field on the on times will depend on the direction
of the electron transfer versus that of the applied field. The field
dependence of the off times will be related to the diagonal and nondiagonal
disorder between the transport sites in PVK. The observed changes
in on and off times when an electric field is applied can be related
via a simplified kinetic scheme to a combination of the Marcus formalism49−53 for electron transfer and the model developed for the hopping of
charge carriers in a Gaussian DOS.57−60 For the combination of ATTO and
a PVK matrix, and for cases where a clear response to the electric
field is observed, the majority of the molecules show a reduced fluorescence
intensity when the electric field is applied. In general, this reduction
is due to longer off times when an electric field is applied, corresponding
to a decrease of k–diss, an increase
of kdiss, and hence a decrease of krec. The on times reveal information about the
electron transfer step and the probability of immediate recombination
versus dissociation of the electron hole pair. Increasing the duration
of on times when an electric field is applied suggests a delay in
the electron transfer step caused by a change in ΔGet° by
−E⃗ * r⃗, which
gives information about the orientation of the ATTO/PVK pair with
respect to the electric field. Some molecules show an increased intensity
when an electric field is applied. Intuitively, one would explain
this observation by a reduction of the rate of the electron transfer
step, which should increase τon. Blinking analysis
reveals however that a decrease of the off times is the main reason
for this behavior. Positions with high nondiagonal disorder will effectively
lead to an increased k–diss upon
increasing the applied field, which will lead to an increase of the
fluorescence intensity. Our study provides in-depth insight into the
fundamental concept of fluorescence intermittency caused by charge
transfer to the environment. This understanding and the used concept
has the potential to unravel mechanistic losses in photovoltaic devices
by means of inducing controlled blinking. Alternatively, electric
field induced blinking can be used for super-resolution techniques,
such as PALM and STORM.
