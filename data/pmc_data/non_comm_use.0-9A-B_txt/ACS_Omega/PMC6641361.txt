The synthesis of
nitrogen, boron, and nitrogen–boron-codoped
graphenes was attained via mixing solutions of GO with urea, boric
acid, and a mixture of both, respectively, followed by drying in vacuum
and annealing at 900 °C for 10 h. These materials were thoroughly
characterized employing XRD, TEM, FTIR, Raman, UV–vis, XPS,
IPCE%, and electrical conductivity measurements. The nitrogen-doped
graphene (NG) showed an excellent supercapacitor performance with
a higher specific capacitance (388 F·g–1 at
1 A·g–1), superior stability, and a higher
power density of 0.260 kW kg–1. This was mainly
due to the designated N types of doping and most importantly N–O
bonds and to lowering charge transfer and equivalent series resistances.
The NG also indicated the highest photocatalytic performance for methylene
blue (MB 20 ppm, power = 160 W, λ > 420 nm) and phenol (5
ppm)
degradation under visible light illumination with rate constants equal
0.013 min–1 and 0.04 min–1, respectively.
The photodegradation mechanism was proposed via determining the energy
band potentials using the Mott–Schottky measurements. This
determined that photoactivity enhancement of the NG is accounted for
by acquisition of nitrogen-oxy-carbide phases that shared in inducing
a higher IPCE% (60%) and a lower band gap value (1.68 eV) compared
to boron and nitrogen–boron-codoped graphenes. The achieved
photodegradation mechanism relied on scavengers performance suggesting
that •OH and electrons were the main reactive species
responsible for the MB photodegradation.

Introduction
Although carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) offer high surface area and conductivity,
they show high contact resistance at the electrode–current
collector and high synthesis charges.1 This
indeed hampered CNT scale up processing for large scale manufacturing
and instead helped the emergence of graphene as an alternative to
overcome the limitations of carbon-based materials. As a result, graphene
is presently the most common 2D material used in energy storage devices
due to its chemical stability as well as its fast electronic transportation,
thermal stability, and superior mechanical characteristics.2−4 Boron and nitrogen doping into the graphene lattice generates polarization
in the carbon network due to discrepancies in the electronegativities
of B (2.05), N (3.04), and C (2.55), thus regulating the electronic,
optical, magnetic, and electrochemical properties of graphene. This
ternary system constitutes a very rich system with a large extent
of miscibility granted by the comparable atomic radii of the components,
and thus little perturbation in the 2D hexagonal sheets of graphene
is expected.5 Doping with B and N can form
p-type and n-type structures respectively, offering a means to modify
the semiconductor properties. The electronic structure (e.g., band
gap, charge density, and spin density) and chemical reactivity can
also be tuned by forming ternary B–C–N structures of
different bonding configurations, with final properties being gradually
altered by regulating the elemental compositions as well as their
amounts.6,7 Thus, B,N-codoped graphene holds great potential
for applications in catalysis and energy storage. Although much research
has been done to synthesize B- or N-doped or B/N-codoped graphene
by decomposing B-, C-, and N-rich precursors via thermal and plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or incorporating dopants via thermal
annealing,8 it still remains a great challenge
to exactly control the doping arrangement at the atomic scale and
their concentrations. The approaches based on CVD for the synthesis
of dual-doped graphene are found tedious and costly for mass production.
A reported chemical method regarding the coannealing of solution-exfoliated
graphene oxide in the presence of ammonia and boric acid was straightforward;8,9 however, it created a covalent boron–carbon–nitride
(BCN) rather than B- and N-codoped graphene (B,N-graphene). Such unavoidable
production of the hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is inevitably obtained,
which is chemically inert in view of its catalytic activity. Despite
tremendous progress in the synthesis of ternary BCN heteroring nanomaterials,10 a high phase purity B,N-graphene in which B
and N replace C atoms in the graphene framework at well-defined doping
sites has not been achieved. This indeed makes the theoretical identification
of the function of guest dopants impractical. In this study, a h-BN-free
B,N-graphene was prepared by a two-stepwise doping method. This method
not only enables the inclusion of heteroatoms at selected graphene
sites but also limits the formation of inactive byproducts and thus
is expected to induce a synergistic activity enhancement for the B,N-graphene
configuration. This catalyst, for example, shows excellent activity
and perfect (nearly 100%) selectivity in oxygen reduction reaction
(ORR) in an alkaline medium compared with that observed for singly
B- or N-doped graphenes.11The B,N-graphene
also shows a complete tolerance for methanol oxidation and excellent
durability, superior to those observed for the commercially used Pt/C
catalysts.12−14 A rare work was done on the codoped N,B-graphene
and mainly concentrated on ORR and microwave absorption.15 However, much work was done on N-doped graphene
synthesized via different nitrogen precursors and conditions to be
in used in batteries, sensors, and ultracapacitors.15−17 Also, highly
dispersed boron-doped graphene nanoribbons (B-GNRs), synthesized via
a simple vacuum activation method, were used for the degradation of
Rhodamine B based on their excellent conductivity and photocatalytic
activity.18 However, the latter photocatalyst
worked only under UV irradiation to photoexcite electrons that were
then consumed to form O2–, while the
holes on B-GR were transported to the HOMO of RhB stimulating its
degradation. This mechanism has been contradicted by Tang et al.,19 who put forth a theory where the degradation
of RhB stems from its sensitization to form a dye excited state followed
by the electron transfer from this LUMO of RhB (−3.08 V vs
vacuum) to the more positive Fermi plane of graphene (−4.42
V vs vacuum), where it combines with surface adsorbed O2 to generate reactive oxidative species.

Accordingly, in a
way of synthesizing a metal-free graphene codoped
with N and B with reference to those of individual analogue, two stepwise
vacuum-annealing pathways were adopted for improving their photocatalytic
qualities to be performed under visible light illumination, despite
the acknowledged fact of the nonphotocatalytic action of graphenes,
as well as their supercapacitor performances selected for higher power
density and cycle efficacy. The proven adsorption capabilities of
graphenes were nullified in this work for providing photocatalytic
active sites on their surfaces for comprehensive organic oxidation,
unlike those in the literature in which graphenes were combined with
a metal or a semiconducting material.20 The structure, surface, optical, and electrical conductivity of
the as-synthesized N-doped (NG), B-doped (BG), and NB-codoped graphenes
(NBG) was evaluated by a variety of complementary techniques, including
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, FTIR,
N2 sorptiometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–vis diffuse reflectance (UV–vis),
incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE%), and electrical conductivity
measurements. The specific capacitance and the outstanding cycle stability
of the electrodes as supercapacitors were estimated via electrochemical
studies (CV, charge–discharge, and EIS), together with evaluating
methylene blue (MB) and phenol degradation via photocatalysis activities
under visible light illumination. This allows elaboration of the effect
of the fabrication conditions of N, B, and NB graphenes, their doping
percentages, distributions in graphene structures, and optical, and
the electronic properties on the consequences of the executed applications.

Results
and Discussion
Bulk, Surface, and Morphology Characteristics
In order
to determine the interlayer spacing of GO and the corresponding changes
thereof following the doping with N, B, and NB, XRD patterns are measured
and presented in Figure 1. The GO pattern shows a prominent crystal plane (001) at a spacing
of 0.71 nm exceeding that of graphite (0.336 nm), proposing the involvement
of oxygen-containing groups at the edges and on every layer of GO.
Additionally, a very weak reflection plane at 2θ = 43°
(100) (with spacing about 0.165 nm) is also revealed, probably referring
to the incomplete oxidation. Doping at the mentioned conditions stimulated
the production of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) exhibiting a shift
to the typical diffraction peak attained at 2θ = 24.5°;
due to the crystal lattice (002) developed without doping, to 26.41°,
26.63°, and 26.36° for NG, BG, and NBG, respectively. Shifting
the peaks to higher angles is attributed to the dislocation and defects
introduced following the insertion of N, B, and NB during the annealing
process. Decrease of the lattice spacing to 0.337, 0.334, and 0.339
nm in NG, BG, and NBG, respectively, compared to the free doped RGO
(0.363 nm) can further support the reduction of RGO at the performed
high annealing temperature. Varying the broadness degree of the (002)
peak, as well as its intensity ratio, before and after doping could
give an idea about not only about the successful adoption of N and
B but also on the fair restacking of the graphene nanosheets. Accordingly,
the weakened intensity as well as broadened width of the reflection
at 2θ = 26.6° of the B-doped graphene compared to the N-graphene
(2θ = 26.41°) is taken as a diagnostic for increased defects
produced following the boron insertion, destroying the graphene crystal
structure. Also, diffusion of the reflection at (100) after doping
compared to that in GO gives a hint about decreasing the number of
oxygen atoms in this plane. The doping of GO was further supported
by the elemental chemical analysis in which the percentage of oxygen
was reduced from 20.8% for GO to 17.0% for NG, whereas for NBG, the
oxygen was reduced to 12.5%, and the carbon percentage was decreased
from 80.2% in NG to 71.2% in NBG. Of particular interest, the nitrogen
percentages in NG and NBG were 2.7% and 7%, respectively. Increasing
C/O ratio for NBG compared with NG is indicative of increasing reduction
in the former material, comparatively.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of GO, RGO,
NG, BG, and NBG.

In order to investigate
the morphology and the nanoscopic details
of the systems, TEM images of NG, BG, and NBG are illustrated in Figure 2. The TEM image in Figure 2a shows that NG sheets
densely overlay each other forming nodes together and exhibiting apparent
wrinkled and folded sheets. The lower magnification as well as the
higher one (inset) shows that NG is porous in nature with an average
aperture of 38 nm. In the case of BG, few graphene layers are clearly
seen (∼5 layers) with a more transparent image (Figure 2b) than that exhibited by NG.
Apart from the smooth and wrinkled morphologies, BG shows spherical
aggregates or defects on its surface, which upon magnification (inset)
reveal a leafy tree like structure of 350 nm dimension. On the other
hand, the TEM image of NBG (Figure 2c) shows layered structures with higher thickness and
many defects, identified as black spots. Magnification of one of the
defect areas illustrates that the nanosheets are full of pores with
an average diameter of 11 nm. On the other hand, the TEM image of
GO shows that it possesses several thin two-dimensional sheets with
a large amount of wrinkles (Figure 2d), configured due to randomly overlaid aggregated
sheets.

their corresponding magnified HRTEM images, as insets.

The developed mesopore structure was well established
from the
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Figure 3, left). All samples show isotherms
of type IV with H2 hysteresis loop indicative of capillary condensation
in mesopores. According to the pore size distribution (PSD) curves
developed by BJH theory, a hierarchical structure of pore diameter
around 1.9 nm was attained (Figure 3, right). The doping with boron created the highest SBET (110 m2/g), the largest pore
volume (0.158 cm3/g), and a pore width of 19.06 Å,
comparable to those exhibited via PSD curves for all doped samples.
Contrarily, NBG possesses the lowest SBET (37 m2/g) and pore volume (0.07 cm3/g) values,
while NG shows median values between the other samples (SBET of 60 m2/g, and pore volume of 0.13 cm3/g). One can suppose that the increase in surface area of
BG is due to the high mesoporosity recognized via the hysteresis loop
closed at p/po of 0.4,
whereas for NG and NBG the hysteresis loops closed at p/po of 0.1, confirming the production
of narrower pores. Despite that, NG still remains the highest mesoporous
doped graphene sample due to the enhancement of its hysteresis loop
area, comparatively.

and NBG
samples together with their corresponding pore size distribution curves

XPS is used to study the nitrogen
and boron configuration after
doping in graphene via monitoring the peaks appearing at about 400
and 284 eV corresponding, respectively, to the N 1s and C 1s. The
C 1s spectrum of NBG (Figure 4) is deconvoluted into four peaks centered at 283.8, 284.9,
286.2, and 288.1 eV composed, respectively, of boron carbide, C–C,
C–N, and C–O moieties. The detailed chemical compositions
of GO, NG, BG, and BNGs are listed in Table 1. The percentages of B and N in the as-grown
B- and N-graphenes as calculated from the XPS survey spectrum were
found to be 8.4% and 2.7%, respectively. The contribution shown at
the higher binding energy (288.1 eV) is possibly correlated to the
carboxylic acid groups at the edges of GO. In N-graphene, the N 1s
spectrum is deconvoluted to several individual peaks that are assigned
to pyridinic N (398.1 eV), pyrrolic N (399.6 eV), graphitic N (401.3
eV), and N oxides (402.8 eV) (Figure 4). Their amounts are decreasing in the same sequence.
The varying peak position of N oxides (402.8 eV) compared to others
in the literature may be due to the varying charges of nitrogen and
its neighbor atoms. Similarly, the B 1s spectrum (Figure S1) is resolved into three peaks at the binding energies
of 190.4, 191.2, and 192.6 eV consistent with the structure of BN,
BC3, and partially oxidized B (e.g., BCO2 and
BC2O), respectively.9,19

FTIR and Raman Spectroscopy
The FTIR spectra of GO
as well as the doped graphenes are presented in Figure 5a. The GO spectrum shows small bands at 1720,
1630, 1383, 1222, 1123, and 1044 cm–1, confirming
the presence of different oxide moieties on its surface. The bands
at 1720 and 1630 cm–1 are, respectively, assigned
to the vibrations of C=O stretching21 and the deformation vibration of OH in absorbed water molecules
or the aromatic C=C stretching vibration.22 The bands at 1383, 1222, 1123, and 1044 cm–1 are assigned to the O–H deformation vibrations of tertiary
C–OH,23 bending absorption of carboxyl
group,24 C–OH stretching,25 and C–O stretching vibration of the epoxy
groups,26 respectively. The broad band
at 3416 cm–1 is indicative of hydrogen bonded OH
groups. The chemical structure of NG shows bands similar to those
detected for GO but with loss in intensity as seen for the bands at
1630, 1382, and 1032 cm–1, indicating the perseverance
of residual OH and C–O groups. Other peaks exist on NG that
are not found in GO, such as 1556, 1184, 1120, 786, and 704 cm–1. Simultaneously, the obtained shift in the hydrogen
bonded OH group from 3416 cm–1 in GO to 3435 cm–1 in NG raises the probability of associating the latter
with the N–H stretching vibrations. The existence of the 1556
cm–1 band correlated to the aromatic C=C
skeletal vibrations characterizes the GO reduction.23−27 It may also be assigned to the C=N stretching
together with 1120 and 1184 cm–1 bands used to characterize
C–N stretching in benzenoid rings;28 in accordance with the XPS results. The advent of peaks at 786 and
704 cm–1 is probably correlated to =C–H
bending vibrations. The FT-IR spectrum of BG shows strong bands at
1174, 1566, and 550 cm–1 with small shoulders at
1120 and 1048 cm–1. It is interesting that the B–O
band (1174 cm–1) and O–B–O band (550
cm–1)29 appeared in the
BG annealed at 900 °C with no probability of forming a B2O3 phase, as XRD analysis cards confirm its absence.
The appearance of the broad band in the margin of 1000–1200
cm–1 is caused by combination of B and O atoms to
verify the evolution of B–O asymmetric stretching (1120–1048
cm–1) vibrations. The existence of the band at 1566
cm–1 establishes the further facile reduction of
GO compared with its counterpart in NG (1556 cm–1). Shift of the band at 3416 cm–1 in GO to 3427
cm–1 in BG, compared to 3435 cm–1 in NG, advocates the presence of residual hydrogen bonded OH groups
in the BG sample. In comparison, the NBG spectrum indicates typical
bands of NG in the mid range (1628, 1581, and 1380 cm–1), together with shoulders in the range 1250–1032 cm–1, acquiring typical features of the BG spectrum. Additionally, the
3435 cm–1 band is more similar to the NG one, suggesting
O–H (N–H) bond formation rather than B–OH ones.
B–O bonds are seen also in the NBG spectrum.

spectra of GO, NG, BG, and NBG samples.

Raman spectroscopy is another technique to obtain very useful
information
concerning the predominant features of D, G, and 2D bands in the spectra
of N-, B-, and NB-doped graphenes. The latter features are represented
by the peaks at 1342–1348, 1590–1596, and 2550–3250
cm–1, respectively (Figure 5b). The shift in wavenumbers exhibited for
the G band (reaching ∼1596 cm–1) following
graphene doping with N and B, together with the exhibited loss in
intensity compared to that in the nondoped GO (1590 cm–1) is indicative of the replacement of C–C by C–N and
C–B bond distances.30 Increase in
the intensity of the D-band when compared to the G-band expresses
the extent of deformation exhibited as a result of doping. The ID/IG intensity ratio,
which relates to a series of defects, increases slightly for NG (1.37)
over BG (1.16) and NBG (1.25) when compared with GO (0.94). Diffusion
of the 2D band of doped graphene samples apart from that seen for
GO is also a diagnostic for the successful incorporation. No criteria
for the B–N bond is formed based on the absence of bands around
1366 cm–1.31

Optical, IPCE,
and Electrical Conductivity Characteristics
The ultraviolet–visible
absorption spectra were collected
to investigate the optical properties and the energy band gaps of
NG, BG, and NBG samples (Figure 6a). The absorption spectra of all doped graphenes show
absorption edge at 420–460 nm due to π → π*
transitions, corresponding to an optical band gap of 2.95–2.69
eV, maximizing the sp2 domains of NG, BG, and NBG. GO indicates
a maximum at 245 nm with lower light absorption in the whole margin.
In addition, N- and B-doped graphenes exhibit extra shoulders at 540
nm (2.3 eV) and 680 nm (1.8 eV) correlated to the n → π*
transitions. They correspond to the electron transition from nonbonding
nitrogen and boron states to the π* states. This indeed reflects
the heterogeneity of N and B distributions in graphene structures.
Interestingly, the NG sample best absorbed light in the UV region
and extending into the visible light region to 1100 nm, exceeding
in sequence BG and NBG samples. On the basis of the Tauc equation,
the measured band gap values were 1.68, 1.9, and 2.04 eV for NG, BG,
and NBG, respectively (Figure 6a), compared with 2.6 eV for GO. Based on the mentioned results,
the doped nitrogen at 2.7% maintaining a median particle domain size
between BG and NBG samples produced the lowest Eg value. NBG has the highest Eg value compared to NG and BG ones, as it presents the lowest absorption
edge in the frequency range of 300–650 nm. This indeed could
limit the expected photocatalytic activity of this specific sample
as a result of lowering the light harvesting capability.

Figure 6 (a) UV–vis
absorption spectra of GO, NG, BG, and NBG, and
their corresponding plots of (αhν)2 versus (hν), (b) electrical conductivity
of GO, RGO, NG, BG, and NBG, and (c) incident-photon-conversion efficiencies
(IPCE%) of NG, BG, and NBG.

Considering that the densities and pressures of all doped
graphenes
are constant while pellets are manufactured, the electrical conductivity
of GO was 8.0 × 10–7 Ω–1cm–1, whereas those of doped graphenes were in
the order NG (30.0 × 10–3 Ω–1 cm–1) > BG (23 × 10–3 Ω–1 cm–1) > NBG (20
× 10–3 Ω–1 cm–1), as determined
from the σ characteristic curves shown in Figure 6b. As is known, charge carrier concentration
and mobility are the factors affecting the conductivity. The electrical
transport studies demonstrate that the predominance of n-type is the
most impressive in NG nanosheets whereas in BG p-type action is the
most leading. Indeed, doping with nitrogen has substantiated the conductivity
via creation of the nonbonding electrons capable of enhancing the
electrical properties over those from holes created via boron insertion.
Decreasing conductivity of the NBG sample is mostly caused by increase
of the boron concentration over nitrogen, as elemental analysis and
XPS confirmed, and thus leakage of the latter into the former via
the n → p transfer, imparting fast recombination is expected
to cause inferior conductivity, that is, electron mobility decrement.
A direct relationship between energy gap and electrical conductivity
in the present study was observed for the NG, where it was difficult
to realize in the case of BG and NBG. In conformity with the conductivity
results, IPCE was measured to evaluate how efficiently these materials
can convert the incident light into electrical energy at a given wavelength. Figure 6c shows that NG expresses
the highest IPCE% (60%) followed in sequence by BG (32%) and NBG (22%)
and thus indicates that NG owns the highest number of carriers created
under the full spectrum of light illumination, that is, integration
of the area under the curve indicates the highest electrical current
density monitored in the visible margin ranges from 450 to 850 nm.
The IPCE spectra for all samples have similar shapes with two absorption
signatures varied with the type of the doped material; for NG, peaks
at 600 and 750 nm are seen, which are red-shifted for rest of the
samples. The IPCE curves were in harmony with the corresponding UV–vis
spectra, thus verifying the obtained results.

Electrochemical Properties
Given the varied defects
and the morphological differences as well as the pore texture variations
after functionalization with N, B, and NB, as characterization results
confirmed, their beneficial use as credible supercapacitor electrodes
are expected to be of wide range. So, the electrochemical characteristics
of these materials were evaluated by CVs, charge–discharge,
and EISs. Figure 7a
presents the CVs of NG, BG, and NBG electrodes at 100 mV s–1. The NG electrode demonstrates a rapid current response at the initial
stages of positive and negative potential scans, therefore displaying
quasi-rectangular profiles. This suggests that the capacitive response
is triggered by the EDL-feature. The largest loop area within the
CV curve of the NG electrode implies the highest capacitance, exceeding
in sequence NBG > BG > GO. The GO electrode distorts apparently,
accompanied
by a broad faradic bump at 0.2 V with a narrowed faradic squeeze within
the potential of −0.8 to 0.4 V, reflecting the lower electrons
and ion conductivities probably due to lowering the graphitization
degree. To further elucidate the electrochemical kinetics at the electrode
surface, the CVs of NG at different scan rates were measured using
the  equation (inset
in Figure 7a). It is
shown that the capacitive current
increases accordingly with scan rates and the curves can maintain
their shape at various scan rates confirming the good rate behavior
of a symmetric device. The response currents are basically correlated
to the square root of scan rates, showing that the electrochemical
charge storage is in part a diffusion controlled process. Thus, the
specific capacitance values calculated for all doped graphenes (Table 2) indicate higher
values at lower scan rates and the best value was for the NG electrode
at 10 mV s–1 and equal 374 F·g–1. Maintaining the CV shape at scan rate of 100 mV s–1 without obvious deformation implies good electron and ion mobility
benefited by the interconnected mesoporous channels of the conducting
NG. This ensures the low resistance of the NG electrode to mass transfer
and good charge propagation of ions at the interfaces between the
electrolyte and the electrode. The obtained CV shape with slopes at
high and low potential was similar to the CV of the ZnFe2O4/NRG composite, which exhibits a specific capacitance
of 244 F·g–1 at 0.5 A g–1 with a cycling durability of 83.8% at a scan rate of 100 mV/s after
5000 cycles.32 Increasing the Csp value for the single element N-doped graphene, over
comparable ones recently reported in the literature,32−37 compared to the other doped graphenes, reflects the efficacy of
the generated active sites on the former in enhancing the charge storage
capacity. The formation of a uniform porous network structure in NG
facilitates the diffusion of Na+ ions where they can be
obstructed by BG and NBG, as TEM and N2 sorptiometry results
confirmed. Additionally, increasing the electrical conductivity due
to the increased charge carrier concentration devoted from the nitrogen
doping as well as the defect-like small pores in the basal plane of
graphene sheet affected the enhancement of the Csp value.

The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves
of all doped electrodes
at a current density of 500 mA g–1 (Figure 7 b) produced nonsymmetric curves
and iR drops, exactly as GO shows (inset in Figure 7b) illustrating the
pseudocapacitive nature of the latter electrode, in agreement with
its CV results.37 Based on the discharging
behavior in NG, BG, and NBG curves, the specific capacitances determined
based on the equation were 425, 400, and 388 F·g–1 at current densities
of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 A g–1, respectively (Table 3). The present values
are comparable and even higher than some typical
carbon-based supercapacitors cited lately and manufactured via laser
reduction of GO films, heteroatom-enriched electrospun carbon nanofiber,
and also B-rGO of a specific capacitance value of 200 F·g–1 reported in 6 M KOH at 0.1 A g–1.33,38−40 The synergistic effects
of N,B-codoped graphene are observed in our samples producing higher
capacitance values (297 F·g–1) exceeding those
in the literature, such as those reported for aligned (239 F·g–1) and nonaligned BCN (167 F·g–1).33,42 However, notably the capacitance of our
NG surpasses those of the latter as well as our synthesized BG and
NBG at similar scan rates. Accordingly, the encountered stability
of the NG electrode during the capacitance retention cycles can also
be correlated to the good contacts between various N–C and
N–O bonds, as confirmed from XPS and FTIR results, which are
good enough to assist charge transitions via such active sites into
the charge collectors. The decreased Csp value of BG in spite of increased SBET compared to NG might be due to greatly increased defects, as well
as the particle size increment, which limit the conductivity via slowing
down the electrolyte adsorption or transfer processes into the electrode
surface.

EISs of different supercapacitors
were measured to further elucidate
the electrochemical behavior during the charge storage processes.
From Figure 7c, the
Nyquist plots of impedances for all devices reveal a straight line
in the low frequency range and a semicircle at intermediate and high
frequency regions. The intercept onto the Z′
axis at the high frequency end indicates the total series resistance
(Rs) including the electrolyte resistance,
intrinsic active material resistance, and contact resistance between
the active material and collector, and they all show comparable values
in the range of 15–18 Ω. The semicircle at intermediate-high
frequency arises from the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface, indicating Rct of 7 Ω for NG, apparently lower than
those of NBG (30 Ω), BG (76 Ω), and GO (225 Ω).
This implies that NG exhibits more rapid adsorption of electrolyte
ions onto the electrode surface and on the efficient interface exhibited
between N and O species. On the other hand, concerning the Warburg
resistance (Zw) of the electrolyte, NG
exhibits the shortest projection length, offering a much lower Zws due to the enlarged pore size. The increased
slope suggests facile ion penetration and diffusion to the surface
of NG through different nitrogen-moieties via the admitted mesopore/micropore
interfaces, as indicated from the N2 adsorption data. The
above data are consistent with the results obtained with vibrational
spectroscopy, electrical conductivity, and CV results. Accordingly,
lowering the Rs, Rct, and Zw values of the NG supercapacitor
indicate that it is the most preferred electrode material. The encountered
higher electrical conductivity of NG together with its unique pore
texturing offers higher contact at the electrode/electrolyte interface.
The inset circuit of the NG (inset in Figure 7c) shows the proximity of the circuit with
the original data obtained from CVs and EISs and most importantly
the existence of double layer capacitance. It shows X2 = 0.45058 μF, which is lower than the other electrodes
suggesting lower internal resistance. The calculated time constant,
configured for the required time to charge the capacitor, evaluated
based on the cutoff frequency fmax, τ
= 1/2πfmax (where fmax is the peak frequency) was the lowest for NG (6.22
× 10–5 s) compared with the other electrodes
by 8–9 times. The latter observations concerning CVs and impedance
measurements indicate the role of the doped N graphene in increasing
charge density as well as separation efficiencies.

Figure 7d shows
the stability of the electrodes for 1000 cycles with 100%, 95%, and
91% capacitance retention at current density of 0.5 A g–1 for NG, NBG, and BG, respectively, whereas GO exhibits a retention
of 70%. To the best of our knowledge, the capacitance value (388 F·g–1 at 1.0 A g–1) reported here is
one of the best data for the SCs reported at different current densities.31−38 The rate capability and long-term stability of the electrode was
retrieved by testing the electrode at higher current densities for
longer time. It was seen that when the material was tested at higher
current densities, it still kept an excellent capacitance value of
250 F·g–1 at a current density of 3.0 A g–1.

Energy density is a decisive parameter of
SCs that restricts their
applicability for electric vehicles since it is very important for
SCs exhibit high capacitance and extraordinary values of energy density.
The Ragone plot (not shown) indicates that NG has much higher energy
density values [calculated using the equations  Wh/kg and  W/kg], exceeding those
of BG and NBG. The
NG displays 38 Wh/kg at 0.5 A g–1 current density
with a good value of power density (260 W/kg) (Table 4). A comparison of our results with the recently
published values (values are taken for single electrode cell) exhibits
that our results show prominently high energy densities without much
compromise on their power densities.33,37,42 Thus, higher values of capacitance and energy density
highlight the advantages of the specified interlayer spacing and unique
composition of NG, which bring in reality a deep level of EDL action
and provide fast transfer of electron and electrolyte ions. The maximum
value for E of the NG-based supercapacitor is about
1.2-fold that of NBG, 1.5-fold that of BG and 15.25-fold that of GO.
It seems that the remarkable performance of the NG supercapacitance
is a result of different existing N-types in graphene that not only
improve the wettability of NG in the electrolyte but also diminish
the intrinsic resistance of graphene in favor of increasing its mobility.43 Specifically, pyridinic and pyrrolic N active
functional groups participate in creating more active deposition sites
of larger binding energies accessible for accommodating a larger number
of Na+ ions to play a dominant role in the capacitance
enhancement. Also, these N-dopants can impart high charge concentration
due to their lone pair of electrons and to the exhibited band gap
reduction they cause for carbon. As XPS confirmed, NG exhibited the
presence of N–O bonds that indeed boost further the pseudocapacitance
performance. Generally, the NG acquires significantly improved capacitance
compared with GO and also exhibits good rate and stability performance.
Consequently, controlling the appropriate nitrogen configuration,
as well as concentration, can greatly promote the capacitance of N-graphenes.
On the other hand, the decreasing capacitance of the NBG electrode
disfavors the importance of N–B bonds, as well as the BCO ones
deconvoluted from XPS B 1s spectra.

Photocatalytic Activities
The MB degradation over doped
graphenes performed under visible light irradiation is shown in Figure 8a. Under dark conditions,
it is shown that NG absorbs more MB with a value of 42%, exceeding
those of BG (23%) and NBG (19%). Consist with the absorption behavior,
NG exhibits the highest MB degradation at 93%, surpassing those of
BG (38.5%) and NBG (25%), performed in a 150 min reaction time and
at a catalyst loading of 0.5 g L–1. The results
in the inset fit to the pseudo-first-order model and give k values in the order; NG 0.0127 min–1 > BG 0.0015 min–1 > NBG 0.0006 min–1. The UV–vis spectra showing the MB concentration dropping
in 150 min, was also presented (inset Figure 8a), to further confirm the first order behavior
and the degradation consequences. The photodegradation performance
of the NG gives a rate constant as high as 8.4 times that of BG and
21 times that of NBG, in the absence of any oxidants, and maximizes
the role of nitrogen-doped types and its amount in achieving such
high photoactivity behavior. Indeed, this superior photoactivity is
directly correlated to the enhanced adsorption; reflecting the superior
contact of MB with NG, as well as its higher conductivity, which facilitates
the rapid charge carrier migration between the 2D graphene planes
with its nitrogen substituted active sites.23 In order to be sure that no further adsorption preceded the degradation
process, the photocatalyst and the target pollutant were left for
2 h to ensure adsorption–desorption equilibrium was established
in the dark before the photocatalytic reaction, and we found that
the achieved adsorption equilibrium was still at the value of 42%.

of NG, BG, and NBG electrodes, where C is the capacitance
and V is the electrode potential at 1 kHz and electrolyte
1.0 M Na2SO4.

The optical absorption of the NG extends to the red region,
exceeding
BG and NBG samples, and exhibits the lowest Eg value facilitating the charge transfer process, as has also
been assessed via CV and EIS results. Increasing the NG catalyst amount
into 1.0 g/L produces a further increase in the MB dark adsorption
to 50% (Figure S2), thus maximizing the
photocatalytic degradation of the MB completing in only 15 min, enhancing
the rate constant 16-fold (0.197 min–1) over that
measured at 0.5 g/L (0.0127 min–1). This is attributed
to increasing the number of the active sites and the consequences
thereof concerning the increase in the amount of photons absorbed
as a result of intensifying the light harvesting capabilities. This
increase in photocatalytic activity is also a consequence of prolonging
the charge lifetime, leading to a low recombination of electrons and
holes. This result was in harmony with the incident photon to current
efficiency that elucidates that NG response was 2 times higher than
that of BG and ∼3 times higher than that of NBG. This supreme
photocurrent recorded for the NG (60%) is indicative of increased
migration rate for the photogenerated carriers and of higher separation
efficiency, facilitating the MB photodegradation. It seems also that
the encountered BG defects signified via TEM images restrict the charge
transfer, which affects by its turn the photocatalytic efficiency.
Interestingly, this excellent visible light driven photocatalytic
activity of the NG exceeded some of graphene based semiconductors
and multilayered graphene quantum dots, as well as the Au/pg-C3N4/GR
composite.42−44

To eliminate the effect of dye self-photosensitization,
a colorless
phenol was adopted to evaluate the sensitivity and the efficacy of
the NG toward its photosensitivity. Figure 8b shows magnificent activity for NG toward
phenol complete degradation with a rate constant of 0.04 min–1 performed in only 60 min under visible light illumination. This
indeed nullifies but does not exclude the electron transfer expected
to take place from MB to NG upon illumination. It seems that the post-treatment
of GO specifically with nitrogen causes reconstruction of the defects
formed via severe oxidation, by repairing such vacant-type defects.45

The left curve slope at nearly time 0
is almost same as the right
one for both MB and phenol during their degradation in the presence
of the NG photocatalyst (Figure 8a,b). In contrast, BG and NBG show a normal behavior.
In order to obviate any doubt concerning the degradation of MB and
phenol on NG surfaces, TOC was measured for both of the pollutants.
After ca. 150 min of visible light irradiation, the MB aqueous (20
ppm) solution in NG that turned completely colorless was accompanied
by approximately 75% TOC removal (Figure S3). This indicates that some colorless intermediates were still dissolved
in the bulk solution. The increase in TOC removal to 95% was clearly
shown after 250 min showing that the phenothiazine structure and the
methyl groups of the MB cations were removed and converted ultimately
to mineralized inorganic products. The TOC for phenol (5 ppm) reached
4.0% TOC removal in 150 min (Figure S3).
The stability test of the NG over five photocatalytic degradation
cycles for MB was evaluated (Figure S4).
It is established that the NG photocatalyst can work at least five
cycles without noticeable loss in the catalytic activity retaining
85% of the catalyst activity during reuse for 750 min, demonstrating
long-term durability of this photocatalyst.

To determine the
reactive species involved on NG surfaces for MB
degradation, trapping experiments using p-benzoquinone
(•O2–scavenger), triethanol
amine (TEOA; hole scavenger), isopropanol (IPA; •OH), and CCl4 (electron scavenger) were performed (Figure 8c). It is apparent
that the abundant reactive oxygen species •OH and
electrons are the most active initiators for the photocatalytic degradation
of the MB contaminant. Meanwhile, holes also shared in the photoactivity
but at much lower amounts than •OH and electrons.
It is further confirmed through the trapping experiments that benzoquinone
induces very small changes suggesting either a marginal effect or
a decreased lifetime of •O2– species during the photocatalytic performance of the NG nanoparticles.
Based on the above results, it was concluded that NG was the most
photoactive component; thus, a tentative mechanism for its photocatalytic
action is proposed and shown in Scheme 1. As a decrease in the oxygen content on the NG and
the consequences of the formation of sp3-hybridized carbon
atoms, an upward VB shift with no change of the CB is likely.46 Thus, the exhibited small band gap can allow
NG to work as a photosensitizer capable of expanding the visible light
absorption range. Due to the declared semiconductor nature of the
NG, it excites more electrons from the VB, which hardly can react
with O2– as the reactive study confirms
but indeed can be trapped by carbon atoms in GO/G due to their p-type
character.46 This indeed leads to a low
recombination rate and lengthening of the lifetime of the charge carriers,
as has been confirmed before using IPCE, conductivity, and EIS results.
The photogenerated holes on the other hand can react with OH–/H2O to form •OH ready for the MB degradation.
Simultaneously, if •O2– is formed and according to its decreased lifetime, as evidenced
from the scavengers study, it can react with 2H+ (from
N–H or O–H groups) to generate •OH
as well. It seems that the appropriate defects appearing on NG surfaces,
as revealed from Raman and XRD results, will decrease the electron
transfer and thus facilitate the separation between e––h+ pairs to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency.

Scheme 1 The electrochemical Mott–Schottky experiment was
carried
out to clarify the relative positions of CB and VB edges (Figure 8d) for all doped
graphenes via using the  equation to have a complete picture and
to support the proposed mechanism (Scheme 1). The plots reveal that NG is a standard
n-type semiconductor, whereas BG is a p-type owing, respectively,
to the evident positive and negative slopes. In the same context,
the NBG plot revealed the combination of n- and p-types, reflecting
that nitrogen doping resulted in the donation of electrons that compensated
the electron deficiency initiated by the boron doping. Of particular
interest, GO shows a negative slope corresponding to the p-type conductivity
manifesting the presence of high oxygen vacancy defects that have
been compensated following the N-doping. Importantly, the flat band
potentials (Efb) of NG and BG were determined
to be 0.31 and 0.87 V versus MSE whereas those of NBG (n- and p-types)
almost coincided around the potential of 0.32 V. Combining the band
gaps determined from UV–vis curves with the determined Efb, the VB levels of NG and BG were calculated
to be 1.27 and 1.04 V, respectively (Scheme 1). The NG electrode showed a positive shift
of the flat-band potential as compared to the BG electrode, and the
slope of the NG line showed a lower value, compared with BG and NBG
lines, testifying clearly the high donor density of NG, as confirmed
previously using IPCE and electrical conductivity data, than its comparable
one in NBG and indeed exceeding the density of acceptors devoted from
the BG. Based on the previous information, a band diagram is constructed
to comprehend that NG has a significant overpotential toward the photocatalytic
water oxidation over NBG and BG ones, facilitating the MB oxidation
consequences.

Conclusion
The formation of various
nitrogenous moieties in NG, synthesized
using urea–GO mixture and annealed at 900 °C in Ar atmosphere,
with a lower band gap and a wide photoresponse margin together with
a separation of the photogenerated charge carriers, has produced outstanding
properties as a photocatalyst for the degradation of various organic
moieties (dye and phenol) under visible light illumination compared
with BG and NBG samples. It has been shown via Mott–Schottky
measurements that the valence band maximum rises obviously in the
NG, and thus elaborated with both optical and electrical measurements,
the oxidation mechanism involves a limited role played by holes in
the valence band, as well as an appreciable role played by the electrons.
The NG has shown marvelous morphological, optical, electrical, and
texturing properties, which all share in boosting the supercapacitance
performance via the EDL mechanism. It is believed that N–O
as well as pyridinic N and pyrrolic N function as active sites for
improving the supercapacitive performance. This study proves the importance
of dopant atoms in graphene, rendering doping as a cost-effective
and ecofriendly synthetic strategy to heighten the supercapacitance,
with superior cycling stability caused by different characteristics
such as ultrafine size, controllable chemical compositions composed
of conductive nitrogen–oxygen–carbons, and the hierarchical
porous structures, unlike B- and BN-graphene. The improved electrical
conductivity due to the increased charge carrier concentration derived
from nitrogen doping and defect-like small pores in the basal plane
of the graphene sheet are considered as paramount factors for the
improvement in the specific capacitance and photocatalysis.

Materials
and Methods
Synthesis of NG, BG, and NBG Catalysts
Graphene oxide
(GO) nanosheets were prepared by a modified Hummers method.47 The obtained GO (0.2 g) was systematically mixed
with a solution of boric acid (0.03 g) and urea (0.36 g) in deionized
water (50 mL). The mixture was then warmed to 80 °C to form a
thick slippery liquid, which was then dried at the same temperature
for 36 h in vacuum. The dried mixture was then annealed at 900 °C
for 10 h in Ar atmosphere to give nitrogen–boron-codoped graphene
(NBG). The monodoped graphenes were similarly synthesized under typical
conditions and concentrations of urea and boric acid to form nitrogen-doped
graphene (NG) and boron-doped graphene (BG), respectively.

Characterization
The phase structure of the products
was measured by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a RigaKu D/max-RB
diffractometer with Ni-filtered graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.54056 nm) at a scan step of 0.02° from
5° to 70°. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies
were performed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI)
with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The specific surface areas
and pore structures were estimated by the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller
(BET) method based on nitrogen absorption–desorption (Micromeritics
ASAP 2020) characteristics. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS,
X-ray monochromatization, Thermon Scientific) was carried out with
Al Kα as the excitation source; the collected binding energies
in the XPS analysis were calibrated against the C 1s peak at 285.0
eV to analyze the surface composition. FTIR analysis was performed
using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer in the range of 4000–400
cm–1. Raman measurements were performed with a Raman
laser spectrometer (DXR) with an excitation line of 632.8 nm. The
optical characterizations of the samples were performed using UV–vis
spectroscopy (Cary 5000). The dc conductivity, σdc, of as-synthesized materials determined at 25 °C was calculated
using the equation σdc = (l/As)(1/Rdc) where Rdc is the sample resistance, l is the length of the sample, and As is the cross-sectional area, collected employing a programmable
automatic LCR bridge (HIOKI 3532-50) and an electrometer (model 6517,
Keithley), voltameter (Keithley, 2182), and 5 kV dc power supply.

Photocatalytic Reaction
The photocatalytic degradation
of methylene blue (MB) dye and phenol was performed under visible
light irradiation using a 160 W lamp with a wavelength of 420 nm.
Doped graphenes (100 mg) and 100 mL of the pollutant solution (5–20
mg/L) were added to a reactor. This solution was stirred at 25 °C
in the dark for 60 min until equilibration. Then, 3 mL of the reaction
mixture was collected and immediately centrifuged to detect the adsorbed
amount of either MB or phenol on the catalyst surface. Clear sample
absorbance was tested using UV–vis jenway-6800 spectrophotometer
at 664 and 267 nm, respectively. The removal efficiency was calculated
using the following equation: removal (%) = (C0 – Ce)/C0 × 100), where C0 and Ce were initial and equilibrium
concentrations, respectively, of MB or phenol (mg/L). For exploring
the reactive species that might be produced in the photocatalytic
reaction,47 we used different scavengers
including isopropanol (a quencher of •OH), p-benzoquinone (a quencher of •O2–), Na2EDTA (a quencher of h+), and carbon tetrachloride (a quencher of e–)
at a concentration of 1.0 mM.

Electrochemical Measurement
The electrochemical measurements
of as-synthesized samples were thoroughly examined at room temperature
in three- and two electrode cell systems named PGSTAT204 associated
with Nova 1.11 software for data calculation. The working electrodes
were made-up by mixing the synthesized catalysts (85 wt %) with 10
wt % acetylene black and 5 wt % PVDF binder. The FTO conductive glass
sheets of dimensions 1 cm2 and resistance 15 Ω cm–2 were well cleaned and dried before depositing the
doped graphenes. The doped graphene electrodes were heated to 200
°C for 3 h then left to cool down to room temperature. The latter
deposited working electrodes were transferred to the electrochemical
cell containing an electrolyte (Na2SO4 of 1.0
M concn), a platinum electrode as the counter electrode, and a saturated
Hg/Hg2SO4 electrode as a reference electrode.
The CVs were performed between the potential of −2 and +1 V
and at scan rates 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, and 50.0 mV/s. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted using the
same mentioned apparatus with conditions of current ranging from 10
μA to 100 mA, a frequency margin of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, and at
a constant potential of 10 mV. The justification of the impedance
spectra was determined based on the Kramers–Kronig transformation.
Specific capacitance was also measured by galvanostatic charge–discharge
via using chronopotentiometry using Digi-Ivy 2116 B-USA, equipped
with DY2100B software for data calculation. The prepared working electrodes
were measured at step current of 0.05, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 mA.
