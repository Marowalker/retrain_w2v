Multiple
studies have been published emphasizing the significant
role of nanoparticle (NP) carriers in antigenic peptide-based subunit
vaccines for the induction of potent humoral and cellular responses.
Various design parameters of nanoparticle subunit vaccines such as
linker chemistry, the proximity of antigenic peptide to NPs, and the
density of antigenic peptides on the surface of NPs play an important
role in antigen presentation to dendritic cells (DCs) and in subsequent
induction of CD8+ T cell response. In this current study, we evaluated
the role of peptide antigen proximity and density on DC uptake, antigen
cross-presentation, in vitro T cell proliferation, and in vivo induction
of CD8+ T cells. To evaluate the role of antigen proximity, CSIINFEKL
peptides were systematically conjugated to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
hydrogels through N-hydroxysuccinimide–PEG–maleimide
linkers of varying molecular weights: 2k, 5k, and 10k. We observed
that the peptides conjugated to NPs via the 2k and 5k PEG linkers
resulted in higher uptake in bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) and increased
p-MHC-I formation on the surface of bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs)
as compared to the 10k PEG linker formulation. However, no significant
differences in vitro T cell proliferation and induction of in vivo
CD8+ T cells were found among linker lengths. To study the effect
of antigen density, CSIINFEKL peptides were conjugated to PEG hydrogels
via 5k PEG linkers at various densities. We found that high antigen
density NPs presented the highest p-MHC-I on the surface of BMDCs
and induced higher proliferation of T cells, whereas NPs with low
peptide density resulted in higher DC cell uptake and elevated frequency
of IFN-γ producing CD8+ T cells in mice as compared to the medium-
and high-density formulations. Altogether, findings for these experiments
highlighted the importance of linker length and peptide antigen density
on DC cell uptake, antigen presentation, and induction of in vivo
CD8+ T cell response.

==== Body
Introduction
The three key elements
in developing an effective vaccine are an
antigen to elicit an adaptive immune response, an immunopotentiator
to stimulate the innate immune system, and a delivery system to ensure
targeting of an antigen and immunopotentiator to antigen presenting
cells (APCs). Nanoparticles (NPs) are often used as a delivery system
to target APCs. In developing PRINT NP subunit vaccines, antigens
and adjuvants are conjugated to the surface of the NPs. At high loadings,
this results in a decrease in particles stability. Nanoparticles (NPs)
are often modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to increase the
particle stability. Various molecular weights (MW) of PEG linkers
have been studied to understand the effect of PEG chain length and
density on PEG surface conformations (brush vs mushroom).1 Although PEG densities higher than those required
for forming the mushroom conformation are necessary for increased
circulation half-life of NPs, high PEG densities are unfavorable for
intracellular delivery of cargos as the PEG shield limits cellular
binding and uptake.2−6

Lessons learned from these studies are being applied to understand
the role of PEG linker length (or proximity of targeting ligand) for
cellular targeting. Improved cellular targeting has been observed
for NPs modified with low MW PEG linkers. Stefanick et al. reported
enhanced cellular uptake by ∼9-fold and ∼100-fold in
breast cancer and multiple myeloma cells, respectively, when cells
were treated with liposomes conjugated to homing peptide by shorter
ethylene glycol linker (EG12) as compared to a longer linker (EG45).7 Micelles prepared from linear poly(ethylene imine)
(l-PEI) grafted to shorter PEG (500 Da) linkers for plasmid DNA delivery
showed higher colloidal stability and transfection efficiency in vitro
and in vivo as compared to micelles prepared by l-PEI–PEG (2000
Da).8 Since nanovaccines target immune
cells including phagocytic dendritic cells (DCs) for antigen presentation
and generation of adaptive immunity, we were interested in evaluating
how PEG linker length can influence cargo display on nanovectors,
as well as cellular uptake, and the downstream effects on the immune
response.

The density of antigens on the surface of nanoparticle
scaffolds
can also affect the quality and magnitude of an immune response.9 For example, virus like particles displaying
conjugated antigen at high densities induced stronger IgG responses.10 Chen et al. found that influenza antigen protein
conjugated to glutathione transferase S-fusion proteins at a higher
density resulted in higher average avidity for M2e-specific mAb and
induced poly clonal antibody with enhanced affinity.11 On the contrary, Brewer et al. showed that NP decorated
with viral antigens such as Env or HA at lower density elicited higher
titers of antigen-specific serum IgG in mice as well as an increased
frequency of antigen-specific antibody secreting cells.12 These findings demonstrate that the density
of antigen on a NP scaffold is a critical determinant of the humoral
immune response.13−15 Compared to monovalent binding, as in the case of
single soluble antigens, antigen display on NPs at an optimum density
may enhance multivalent binding to B cell receptors, better stimulate
the downstream molecular events, and induce stronger immune response.16

On the other hand, how the T cell response
is influenced by the
antigen density has not been well studied. Priming of T cells requires
uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and processing of antigens
into peptides that can be presented by major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class I or II as a peptide/MHC complex (pMHC) on the cell surface.
Different from whole protein antigens, synthetic antigenic peptides
can bind directly to the cell surface MHC class I or II or be internalized
and processed to be presented on the cell surface as pMHC. Peptide
cancer vaccines target antigen presenting DCs to induce potent antitumor
T cell response and have been explored in preclinical and clinical
studies. We have shown that loading T cell antigen peptides on NPs
can greatly improve antigen presentation and T cell priming and proliferation.17,18 However, very little is known about how peptide antigen proximity
and density on a NP surface affect cellular uptake, DC stimulation,
and the induction of in vivo T cell response. Toward that end, we
systemically explored the effect of antigen proximity by conjugating
MHC-I peptide epitope to NP surface via various molecular weights
of PEG linkers (PEG2k, PEG5k, PEG10k) and evaluated their effect on cellular uptake, antigen cross-presentation,
in vitro T cell proliferation, and in vivo induction of CD8+ T cells.
After selecting the optimum linker length, we conjugated MHC-I peptide
epitope at varied densities and evaluated its effect on in vitro and
in vivo immune responses. Findings in this work highlight the importance
of linker length and peptide antigen density on DC uptake, antigen
presentation, and induction of in vivo CD8+ T cell response.

Results
and Discussion
Conjugation of CSIINFEKL to PEG Hydrogels
We have synthesized
acrylate monomer and PEG cross-linker-based hydrogels and incorporated
aminoethyl methacrylate to introduce reactive handle on the surface
of hydrogel NPs. Hydrogel NPs (80 × 80 × 320 nm3) were fabricated via particle replication in nonwetting template
(PRINT) technology.19 PRINT hydrogel particles
were modified with CSIINFEKL utilizing a similar conjugation process
as described previously, where amine groups on the NP surface were
used to conjugate to the cysteine via SCM–PEG–maleimide
linkers (2k, 5k, or 10k molecular weights).18 Briefly, particles were modified with equal moles of linkers to
ensure similar linker densities and particle surface charge. After
modification with the PEG linkers, NPs were incubated overnight with
CSIINFEKL resulting in peptide conjugation to the NPs via Michael
addition. To control antigen density, the peptide was charged at various
amounts, and peptide loading per mg of NP was quantified utilizing
a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA). This was then converted to peptide
density (peptides/nm2). CSIINFEKL-modified NPs were further
modified with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) by incubation with thiol
containing CpG ODN to yield the final formulation of NPs with co-conjugated
CSIINFEKL and CpG. However, for medium- and high-density peptide formulations,
the addition of CpG leads to particle aggregation. To avoid particle
aggregation, two sets of particles were fabricated, one set modified
with CSIINFEKL, and one set modified with CpG ODN, particles where
then mixed prior to in vivo inoculation. For in vitro cellular uptake
studies, CSIINFEKL peptide was conjugated to fluorescein-labeled PEG
hydrogels. Size, polydispersity index (PDI), and ζ-potential
(ZP) of fluorescein-labeled PEG hydrogels were found to be similar
to unlabeled (no fluorescein) NPs (data not shown). PEG hydrogels
modified with linker only were also prepared to serve as a control
group for the in vitro studies. All final NP formulations used in
vitro and in vivo studies were evaluated for endotoxin level and confirmed
to have endotoxin <0.1 EU/mg NP.

Nanoparticle surface charge
can influence cellular uptake and in vivo biodistribution.20−22 Cationic nanoparticles are known to have higher uptake by cells
and can facilitate cytosolic delivery of cargo by facilitating endosomal
escape.20,23 Therefore, our overall objective during
formulation development was to keep the surface charge of NP positive
to achieve optimum uptake by DCs and further induction of CD8+ T cell
response.

Physical characterizations of nanoparticles used in
cell studies
are shown in Table 1. Surface charges of NPs modified with PEG2k and PEG5k were 41 and 47 mV, respectively. When PEG10k was
conjugated to NPs, surface charge decreased to 32 mV. This could be
due to the charge shielding effect of longer chain PEG10k. This decrease in surface charge was also observed when the CSIINFEKL
peptide was conjugated to the PEG2k and PEG5k formulations; however, for PEG10k formulations, the change
in ZP was minimal. Similar decreases in ZP were observed when NPs
were modified with low, medium, and high antigen density peptides,
as seen in Table 1.

Physical characterizations of NPs used in vivo studies are shown
in Tables 2 and 3. As shown in Table 2, when CpG ODN was conjugated to PRINT hydrogels, due
to its negative charge, the NP surface charge became neutral. Size
and PDI slightly increased, possibly due to the stearic crowding of
biomolecules (CSIINFEKL and CpG ODN) on the surface of PRINT hydrogels.24,25 However, as shown in Table 3, when CpG and CSIINFEKL were conjugated separately for antigen
density studies, ZP of NPs remained positively charged.

Effect of the Linker Length and Peptide Antigen
Density on NP
Uptake by BMDCs
We evaluated the effect of the linker length
on cellular uptake of fluorescein-labeled NPs using bone marrow-derived
dendritic cells (BMDCs), as DCs are the most efficient antigen presenting
cells for T cell priming and DCs are efficient in the uptake of particulate
matter through phagocytosis. As vaccines are generally administered
based on the dose of antigen, we dosed BMDCs with 5 μg/mL of
SIINFEKL, free or associated with NPs (Figure 1A,B). Cells were then washed and examined
by flow cytometry for the population that was positive for NP fluorescence.
BMDCs dosed with NPs conjugated to CSIINFEKL through 2k PEG and 5k
PEG linkers had much higher percentage of uptake (and mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI)) as compared to the 10k PEG formulation (Figures 1A and S1A), suggesting that the “stealthiness”
generated by 10k PEGs on the particle surface interfered with the
interactions between the particles and cells. On the other hand, BMDCs
dosed with the low-density CSIINFEKL–NPs at a dose of 5 μg/mL
peptide displayed higher NP uptake (and MFI) as compared to high-
or medium-density CSIINFEKL NPs (Figures 1B and S1B). Since
less NPs were dosed on cells for the higher peptide density NPs at
any given antigen dose, the differential cell uptake could be due
to the variance in NP mass. Therefore, we also examined the NP uptake
with constant NP mass at 50 μg/mL (Figure 1C). Interestingly, an increase in cell uptake
was observed with increasing peptide density on NPs (Figure 1C). This increase was even
more dramatic when shown as mean fluorescence intensity of cells (Figure S1C).

antigen density on the
uptake of NPs by BMDCs. BMDCs on day 6 were treated with NPs labeled
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for 4 h, washed and further
incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. Cells with NP fluorescence were
analyzed by flow cytometry. (A) Linker length comparison at 5 μg/mL

by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey’s multiple comparison
test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
and ***p < 0.001.

Effect of the Linker Length and Peptide Antigen Density on p-MHC-I
Complex Presentation on BMDCs
We hypothesized that antigen
proximity would affect the uptake of NPs and thus the antigen presentation
by BMDCs. To determine these effects, we investigated the presentation
of SIINFEKL–MHC-I complex on BMDCs as a function of antigen
proximity. To conduct these studies, two sets of BMDCs (in triplicate)
were either untreated or treated with soluble SIINFEKL, NP–PEG2k–CSIINFEKL, NP–PEG5k–CSIINFEKL,
or NP–PEG10k–CSIINFEKL for 4 h at 5 μg/mL
peptide. After 4 h, BMDCs were washed and treated with citrate buffer
(pH 3.0) to remove the surface-bound p-MHC complex. One set of cells
was fixed with paraformaldehyde, and another set of cells was further
incubated at 37 °C for another 20 h. The purpose of further incubation
was to evaluate whether after internalization, if the nanoparticle-bound
CSIINFEKL was released and presented on p-MHC-I complex.

Intracellular
processing and cross-presentation of exogenous antigen by dendritic
cells (DCs) to T cells via MHC-I and MHC-II proteins are relatively
well established.26 Particulate antigens
are taken up by DCs via receptor-mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis27,28 and are either degraded in endocytic compartments (for class II
presentation) or escape the endosome/phagosome and are degraded in
the cytosol (for class I presentation).26 The resulting peptide fragments can then be loaded onto MHCs for
cell surface presentation as pMHC.26,29 In this study,
CSIINFEKL peptide was conjugated to PRINT-based hydrogel via thioether
bond, which allows controlled and sustained release of peptides over
days under reducing conditions (e.g., cytosol), as previously reported.18 Moreover, enzymes present in various intracellular
compartments may also contribute to the cleavage and release of antigenic
peptides from PRINT hydrogel nanoparticles.30 Therefore, we think that the antigen bound to PRINT hydrogel via
thioether linker is possibly getting released from the NPs in reductive
intracellular compartments of DCs. Once CSIINFEKL is released in its
native form or bound with thioether linker, it is then cross-presented
to T cells via MHC-I pathway.

To quantify antigen cross-presentation,
BMDCs were stained with
the 25-D1.16 antibody, which recognizes SIINFEKL/H-2Kb on APCs. Signals
from the 4 h-treated BMDCs were subtracted from 4 h + 20 h-treated
BMDCs, and the data is represented as % of cells positive for p-MHC-I
complex or MFI of PE. As shown in the dot plot analysis (Figure 2A), BMDCs treated
with linker-modified NPs had no antigen presentation. BMDCs treated
with all three formulations, NP–PEG2k–CSIINFEKL,
NP–PEG5k–CSIINFEKL, and NP–PEG10k–CSIINFEKL had higher p-MHC-I complex staining intensity
as compared to soluble SIINFEKL and untreated cells after 24 h (Figure 2B,C). When BMDCs
were treated with NP–PEG10k–CSIINFEKL, staining
of p-MHC-I complex was only 12.2% as compared to 52.8 and 72.3% when
treated with NP–PEG2k–CSIINFEKL and NP–PEG5k–CSIINFEKL, respectively. CSIINFEKL conjugated to
NPs via PEG5k outperformed all other formulations in their
antigen presentation efficiency in BMDCs, as shown in Figure 2A,B.

Figure 2 Effect of the linker
length and the antigen density on antigen
presentation in BMDCs. Two sets of BMDCs were dosed with different
formulations (at a dose of 5 μg/mL peptide, free or associated
with NPs) for 4 h at 37 °C, washed and treated with citrate buffer
of pH 3.0 to remove surface-bound p-MHC-I complex. One set of BMDCs
was further incubated at 37 °C for another 20 h. At the end of
the experiment, cells were stained with 25-D1.16 antibody which recognizes
SIINFEKL/H-2Kb on APCs and analyzed via flow cytometry. Signals from
4 h-treated BMDCs were subtracted from 4 h + 20 h-treated BMDCs and
data are shown as % of cells positive for p-MHC-I complex for (A)
linker length and (C) antigen density or shown as MFI of PE for (B)
linker length and (D) antigen density. Representative flow cytometry
histograms are shown in panel (E). Results are shown as mean ±
SEM, n = 3. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA,
Tukey’s multiple comparison test, **p <
0.01, **p < 0.001 and ****p <
0.0001. Only comparisons among the three NPs groups are shown in (A–D),
and all three NP groups are at least *p < 0.05
compared to untreated, SIINFEKL or blank NPs.

To evaluate the multivalence effect (or density of peptide
on NP
surface), BMDCs were also treated with either NP–PEG5k–CSIINFEKLlow or NP–PEG5k–CSIINFELmedium or NP–PEG5k–CSIINFEKhigh. At same antigen concentrations, we found that BMDCs treated with
medium- and high-density CSIINFEKL NPs had higher % of p-MHC-I and
MFI as compared to BMDCs dosed with lower antigen density carrying
NPs. In other words, BMDCs dosed with the least amount of particles
with higher antigen molecules on the surface were able to present
the highest amount of p-MHC-I complex as compared to BMDCs treated
with the highest amount of particles with low antigen density on their
surface. The MFI of BMDCs was found to be doubled when treated with
high antigen density NPs as compared to medium-density NPs. This indicates
that at a high antigen density, NP–CSIINFEKL presented more
p-MHC-I complexes on the surface of BMDC, likely due to stronger multivalent
binding and internalization of NP–CSIINFEKL. Future experiments
will be designed to gain more insight into processing and cross-presentation
of CSIINFEKL-bound PRINT hydrogels in DCs.

Effect of the Linker Length
and the Antigen Density on in Vitro
Proliferation of OT-I T Cells
In previous studies, we observed
that CSIINFEKL conjugated to NPs via 5k PEG linkers had higher cellular
uptake as well as higher presentation of p-MHC-I complex via BMDCs.
Therefore, we hypothesized that the conjugation of CSIINFEKL to NPs
via 5k PEG linker would result in higher activation and proliferation
of CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells derived from OT-I T cell receptor transgenic
mice were used to evaluate SIINFEKL-specific T cell response for NP
and soluble vaccine formulations. BMDCs were dosed with soluble SIINFEKL,
NP–PEG2k–CSIINFEKL, NP–PEG5k–CSIINFEKL, or NP–PEG10k–CSIINFEKL
at either 1 or 10 μg/mL peptide for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells
were then washed to remove NPs (soluble SIINFEKL was not removed)
and co-cultured with CTV-labeled OT-I T cells for 88 h at 37 °C.
At the end of incubation, cells were stained with anti-CD3, CD8, and
CD11c antibodies and examined by flow cytometry.

As shown in Figure 3A, soluble SIINFEKL-pulsed
BMDCs stimulated OT-I T cell proliferation at 1 μg/mL. BMDCs
treated with NP–CSIINFEKL at a peptide concentration of 1 μg/mL
resulted in similar T cell growth as compared to BMDCs treated with
soluble SIINFEKL (Figure 3B). No significant difference was observed among the three
NP formulations evaluated.

Figure 3 Effect of the linker length and the antigen
density on in vitro
proliferation of CD8+ OT-I T cells. BMDCs were dosed with various
NP formulations at 1 μg/mL concentration of peptide for 4 h
at 37 °C. Cells were then washed to remove NPs and co-cultured
with CTV-labeled OT-I T cells for 72 h at 37 °C. At the end of
the incubation period, cells were stained with anti-CD3, CD8, and
CD11c antibodies and examined by flow cytometry. Representative flow
cytometry histograms are shown in panel (A). Percentage cell growths
of CD8+ OT-I T cells for various linker lengths and antigen density
are compared in (B) and (C), respectively. Results are shown as mean
± SEM, n = 3. Data were analyzed by one-way
ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparison test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.

To evaluate the multivalency
effect of the peptide-decorated NP
surface, BMDCs were treated with either NP–PEG5k–CSIINFEKLlow, NP–PEG5k–CSIINFELmedium, or NP–PEG5k–CSIINFEKhigh for 4 h at 37 °C. Consistent with the p-MHC-I presentation
results, NPs with the higher antigen density induced higher OT-I T
cell proliferation (Figure 3C).

These data sets indicate that differences in antigen
proximity
observed during cell uptake studies and the antigen presentation assay
for 5k PEG linker did not translate into higher proliferation of CD8+
T cells in vitro. However, high antigen density on NPs that displayed
higher uptake and p-MHC-I presentation in BMDCs was able to translate
into higher CD8+ T cell priming and proliferation.

Effect of the
Linker Length and the Antigen Density on Antigen-Specific
IFN-γ Producing CD8+ T Cell Response
In an effort to
determine if linker length would affect the induction of CD8+ T cell
response in mice, the frequency of antigen-specific IFN-γ producing
T cells in the spleens of mice was evaluated ex vivo by ELISPOT. To enhance the immunogenicity of the antigenic peptide,
CpG was co-conjugated to the NPs with peptides displayed on three
linkers to facilitate induction of T cell response (Table 2). As shown in Figure 4A, C57BL6/J mice were vaccinated
on day 0 and 13 with either soluble SIINFEKL + soluble CpG, NP–PEG2k–CSIINFEKL–CpG, NP–PEG5k–CSIINFEKL–CpG,
or NP–PEG10k–CSIINFEKL–CpG. After
7 days of the boost dose, splenocytes were harvested, and IFN-γ
producing T cells were evaluated by ex vivo ELISPOT
assay. As shown in Figure 4B, vaccination with soluble peptide and CpG admix induced
minimal response similar to untreated mice, even though CpG is a strong
immunostimulator. This is consistent with the poor immunogenicity
of soluble antigenic peptides reported in the literature that is mostly
due to their low stability, tissue retention, and cell uptake,31 which bolsters the need for particulate delivery
systems for co-delivering peptide antigens with adjuvants.17 On the other hand, all three nanoparticle formulations
induced a high frequency of IFN-γ producing CD8+ T cells (>1000
spots/million splenocytes on average) in mice. However, no significant
difference was observed among the three NP formulations with different
PEG linker lengths tested in this animal study. The higher particle
uptake and p-MHC-I complex presentation of the 5k PEG linker did not
translate to any significant improvement in this effector T cell function
in vivo.

Figure 4 Effect of the linker length and the antigen density on IFN-γ
producing CD8+ T cells in spleen. (A) Experimental design. On day
0 and 13, mice were immunized with various samples containing the
equivalent of 100 μg peptide and/or 20 μg CpG via s.c.
injection in the left flank. After 1 week, splenocytes were isolated
and restimulated with 5 μg/mL of SIINFEKL for 22 h and analyzed
for IFN-γ production by an ELISPOT assay. (B) Effect of the
linker length. (C) Effect of antigen density. Results are shown as
mean ± SEM, n = 5–6 (except for vehicle
control in (B) which is n = 3). Data were analyzed
by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.

As discussed earlier,
physicochemical properties of NPs such as
size and surface charge affect their uptake by APCs, intracellular
trafficking, and in vivo biodistribution.20−22 Generally,
NPs with a diameter of <100 nm can traffic directly to lymph nodes
by diffusion and convection, whereas nanoparticle with a diameter
of ∼200 nm or greater traffic to lymph nodes via cell-mediated
transport or through hydrodynamic swelling caused by the injection
itself.32,33 We think that the neural surface charge
and higher hydrodynamic diameter of these NPs (Table 2) could have resulted in to their variable
uptake by APCs and lymphatic trafficking, and thus translated to no
significance difference in induction of CD8+ T cells.

We had
also observed enhanced particle uptake, MHC-I presentation,
and T Cell proliferation with increased peptide density in vitro.
Therefore, we evaluated whether changing antigen density on NPs would
result in an enhanced induction of CD8+ T cell response in vivo. As
shown in Table S1, when medium and high
densities of CSIINFEKL were co-conjugated with CpG on NPs, the size
of the NPs increased drastically indicating particle instability and
aggregation, likely due to the neutralization of the positive particle
charge. To eliminate NP size as an influencing factor in the study
of antigen density, CSIINFEKL and CpG were conjugated onto separate
NPs (through PEG5k only), which were then mixed together
for vaccination. As shown in Table 3, these particles were stable and monodisperse. The
same dosing schedule in Figure 4A was followed for mice treated with either vehicle, soluble
SIINFEKL + CpG, NP–PEG5k–CSIINFELlow + NP–CpG, NP–PEG5k–CSIINFEKmedium + NP–CpG, or NP–PEG5k–CSIINFEKhigh + NP–CpG.

As shown in Figure 4C, all NP constructs induced a high frequency
of IFN-γ producing
CD8+ T cells in mice as compared to the soluble components. Interestingly,
the lowest antigen density resulted in the highest frequency of IFN-γ
producing CD8+ T cells, about 1500 T cells per 106 splenocytes
compared to 800–1000 for the other two peptide density groups.
This is contradictory to the results obtained in the in vitro p-MHC-I
presentation study as well as OT-I T cells induction study where NPs
with higher antigen density performed significantly better as compared
to other densities. However, enhanced particle uptake was observed
for low peptide density NPs. In addition, given the same amount of
antigen dosed in mice, more particles were administered in the low-density
NP sample, which may help overcome the in vivo tissue hindrance and
accessibility to immune cells. Therefore, perhaps particle uptake
and trafficking play a larger role in predicting in vivo efficacy;
however, further investigation needs to be done to evaluate in vivo
particle uptake by DCs and trafficking to lymph nodes.

Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the effect of antigen proximity and
density on NP uptake and antigen presentation by BMDCs, in vitro T
cell proliferation, and induction of IFN-γ producing CD8+ T
cells in mice. Although the 5k PEG linker showed higher particle uptake
and antigen presentation in BMDCs, in vitro proliferation of OT-I
T cells and induction of IFN-γ producing CD8+ T cells were similar
to other linkers. NPs with high antigen density resulted in higher
antigen presentation and proliferation of OT-I T cells. However, low
antigen density PEG hydrogels induced the highest CD8+ T cell response
in mice, indicating that more particles with fewer antigens could
be better at inducing an immune response in vivo as compared to fewer
particles with higher antigen surface density. Taken together, this
study sheds light on the importance of MHC-I peptide antigen proximity
and density on cellular uptake and antigen presentation by DCs and
the induction of a CD8+ T cell response.

Methods
PRINT Nanoparticle Fabrication
The PRINT particle fabrication
process is described previously.18 Briefly,
the preparticle solution was prepared by dissolving 3.5 weight percent
(wt %) of the various reactive monomers in isopropyl alcohol. Preparticle
solution was composed of 69 wt % HP4A, 10 wt % PEG700DA, 20 wt % AEM, and 1 wt % TPO. Using # 3 mayer rod, a
thin film of preparticle solution was drawn on to corona-treated PET
using roll-to-roll lab line (Liquidia Technologies) running at 12
feet per minute. The solvent was evaporated by heat guns. Then, 80
× 80 × 320 nm3, the cylinder-shaped mold was
laminated to the delivery sheet and passed through nip (80 psi, 12
feet per minute). After delamination, filled molds were cured by passing
through UV LED lamp (λmax = 395 nm, 30 psi N2, 12 feet per minute; Phoseon). After cross-linking the hydrogels
inside the mold cavities, the filled mold was laminated against PVA
harvesting sheet and passed through the heated nip (140 °C, 80
psi, 12 feet per minute). Particles were removed from the mold by
splitting the harvesting sheet from the mold. Particles were then
harvested by dissolving sacrificial harvesting layer of PVA into water
(2 mL of water per 10 feet of harvesting sheet). Particle suspensions
were passed through 2 μm filter to remove additional scum layer.
To remove excess of PVA, particles were spun down at 14 000
rpm (Eppendorf Thermomixer R) for 25 min and resuspended into sterile
water. This purification procedure was repeated 3 times.

Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA)
Concentrations of
particles were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using
a TA Instrument’s Discovery TGA. Aluminum sample pans were
tarred before loading the sample. The stock nanoparticle solutions
(20 μL) were loaded on to the pan. Samples suspended in water
were heated at 30 °C/min to 130 °C, followed by a 10 min
isotherm at 130 °C. All samples were then cooled at 30 °C/min
to 30 °C, followed by a 2 min isotherm at 30 °C.

Dynamic
Light Scattering (DLS)
Particle size and ζ-potential
(ZP) were measured in sterile water by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
on a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Ltd.).

Conjugation
of Linker to NPs
We utilized amine groups
from AEM to conjugate NPs to NHS–PEG–Mal. Equal moles
of NHS–PEG2k–Mal (1.56 mg), NHS–PEG5k–Mal (3.89 mg), and NHS–PEG10k–Mal
(7.78 mg) were dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF). The volume of
DMF was kept constant at 160 μL regardless of different linker
masses used. NPs were modified with NHS–PEG–Mal, as
mentioned here in ref (18). Briefly, 1 mg of NPs was continuously agitated for 2 h at 1400
rpm (Eppendorf Thermomixer R) in the presence of linker. The total
volume of the reaction was 1 mL. After 2 h, the unconjugated linker
was removed from the NPs via 2 centrifugation washes (Eppendorf Centrifuge
5417g) with sterile water at a speed of 13 000g.

Conjugation of CSIINFEKL to Linker-Modified NPs
Conjugation
reaction of CSIINFEKL to NPs via NHS–PEG–Mal was performed,
as mentioned in ref (18). After modifying NPs with the linker, CSIINFEKL peptide was conjugated
by performing the reaction in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
buffer of pH 7.0. Briefly, an equal amount of peptide (0.200 mg) was
charged to the reaction chemistry to conjugate a similar amount of
peptide by various linkers. After 2 h, unconjugated peptide was removed
from the NPs via 2 centrifugation washes (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5417g)
with sterile water at a speed of 13 000g.
To conjugate different densities of peptides to NPs, particles were
modified by NHS–PEG5k–Mal. Different amounts
of CSIINFEKL, 0.050, 0.500, and 1.0 mg, were charged to the conjugation
recipe for low-, medium-, and high-density NP, respectively. At the
end of the conjugation process, peptide loading was evaluated by performing
standard BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on particle-conjugated
peptides. BCA absorbance reading of linker-modified particles was
subtracted from the reading of peptide-conjugated NPs. All formulations
were evaluated for endotoxin level using Pierce LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin
Quatitation Kit using 1 mg/mL of NP.

Reduction and Purification
of CpG
Reduction and purification
of CpG were performed, as previously described.17 Briefly, C6 S–S-C6 CpG 1826 was reduced with 100
mM dithiothreitol solution in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and
purified by gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex NAP-10 column.
The concentration of CpG was measured by evaluating absorption at
260 nm by using NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer.

Conjugation
of Thiol-CpG 1826 to NPs
After reduction
and purification of C6-CpG ODN, conjugation of CpG ODN to NPs via
different PEG linkers was done following the literature procedure.17 Briefly, CSIINFEKL-conjugated NPs were incubated
with thiolated CpG overnight. NPs were washed 3 times with 10×
PBS to remove electrostatically bound CpG. All supernatants were collected.
Evaluation of CpG in supernatants was done via UV/vis spectroscopy
at 260 nm by using NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer. The amount of
conjugated CpG was determined by subtracting the amount of unconjugated
CpG in supernatants.

Animals
Female C57BL/6J mice were
purchased from Jackson
Laboratory and used at age 6–12 weeks. OT-I transgenic mice
were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and bred at UNC. All experiments
involving mice were carried out in accordance with an animal use protocol
approved by the University of North Carolina Animal Care and Use Committee.

Preparation of BMDCs
BMDCs were prepared and cultured
as in ref (17). Briefly,
bone marrow was collected from mouse femurs and tibias. After lysing
erythrocytes by ACK lysis buffer, cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% FBS, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 ng/mL GM-CSF, and
10 ng/mL of IL-4 (R&D Systems). On day 6, BMDCs were harvested
and further purified CD11c+ DCs with Mouse CD11c Microbeads (Miltenyi
Biotec) following manufacturing instructions.

Cell Uptake
Study
To test cellular uptake of particles
by BMDCs, particles with FITC incorporated in the matrix were utilized
to track them. Day 6 BMDCs were dosed with samples for 4 h, washed,
and further incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. Cells were then examined
with Cyan ADP followed by analysis with the Summit software.

OT-I
T Cell Proliferation Study
Day 6 BMDCs were dosed
with SIINFEKL or NP samples for 4 h, washed, and further incubated
at 37 °C for 23 h. OT-I CD8+ T cells were isolated from spleens
of OT-I mice using mouse CD8 T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec)
and labeled with CellTrace Violet Cell Proliferation Kit (Invitrogen)
for 10 min at 37 °C. Labeled OT-I cells were then added to treated
BMDCs and co-incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. After the incubation,
cells were stained with CD8-PerCP-eFluor710, CD3-FITC, and CD11c-PE
(eBioscience) and examined for T cell proliferation with Cyan ADP
followed by analysis with Summit software.

Antigen Presentation Assay
in BMDCs
Day 6 BMDCs (3
× 105 cells) were either untreated or treated with
various formulations or soluble CSIINFEKL peptide at a dose of 5 μg/mL
for 4 h. After 4 h of incubation, cells were either washed with citrate-phosphate
buffer (pH 3.0) for 3 min on ice to strip off the MHC-I–peptide
complex or NP-peptide/H-2Kb complex from the cell surface.
Additionally, cells were reincubated at 37 °C for an additional
20 h postwashes and then stained with CD11c-APC and 25-D1.16-PE (anti-SIINFEKL/H-2Kb complex) antibodies (eBioscience), followed by flow cytometry
analysis on Cyan ADP (Dako).

Immunization Study
Immunization studies were performed,
as in ref (17). Briefly,
all formulations were prepared 24 h before injections, resuspended
in isotonic 9.25% sucrose/H2O, and subcutaneously administered
in the left flank. SIINFEKL was given at a dose of 100 μg, and
CpG was injected at a dose of 20 μg. Prime and boost doses were
administered on day 0 and 13, respectively. On day 20, mice were sacrificed,
and spleens were harvested for further analysis, as described here
previously.18

IFN-γ ELISPOT Assay
The frequency of antigen-specific
IFN-γ producing T cells in the spleen was evaluated using IFN-γ
ELISPOT kit (BD Biosciences). Immobilon-P hydrophobic PVDF plates
(Millipore) were briefly treated with 35% ethanol, washed 2 times
with PBS, and coated overnight with anti-mouse IFN-γ antibody
at 4 °C. The following day, plates were blocked with 200 μL
R-10 medium with for 2 h at room temperature. 100 000 splenocytes
in R-10 medium were plated in each well with or without restimulation
with 10 μg/mL of SIINFEKL peptide overnight at 37 °C. Spots
were then developed following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Unstimulated control showed minimum numbers of spot. Data presented
herein are obtained using n = 4–6 animals
(except for vehicle control in linker length study which was n = 3).
