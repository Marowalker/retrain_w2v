Electroadhesive devices can lift
materials of different shapes
and various types using the electrostatic force developed at the interface
between the device and the object. More specifically, the electrical
potential generated by the device induces opposite charges on the
object to give electrostatic Maxwell force. Although this technology
has a great deal of potential, the key design factors based on the
fundamental principles of interfacial polarization have yet to be
clearly identified. In this study, we identify that the lifting force
is quantitatively related to the total length of the boundary edges
of the electrodes, where the induced charges are selectively concentrated.
We subsequently propose a model equation that can predict the electrostatic
lifting forces for different object materials as a function of the
applied voltage, impedance, and electrode-boundary length. The model
is based on the fact that the amount of induced charges should be
concentrated where the equipotential field distance is minimal. We
report that the impedance magnitude is correlated with the electroadhesive
lifting forces by analyzing the impedance characteristics of objects made of different materials (e.g., paper, glass, or metal),
as attached in situ to the electroadhesive device.

Introduction
As an alternative to the mechanical gripper,
which usually requires
strain or stress controlling units to avoid damage while picking up
of fragile and/or soft objects,1−3 the electroadhesive picking tool
is considered attractive because it could intrinsically avoid damage
to objects, without using such stress/strain control units. This electroadhesive
picking tool adopts an interfacial electrostatic force, which is developed
only at the interface of the objects in the shearing mode.4−6 The electroadhesive device is capable of adhering to almost any
shape of any type of object made from steel, glass, paper, wood, concrete,
and so forth, so long as these materials could allow the induced charges
to be formed at the device–object interface.7−10 It subsequently makes the electroadhesive
device quite attractive as an ideal picking technology that can be
used11−14 in such areas as the warehouse industry,15 semiconductor manufacturing,16 robots,
and so forth.17 Despite its attractive
features, it has been pointed out that the lifting force is often
short of the utilization requirements; and more importantly, the key
controlling factors of the lifting force for different object materials
have yet to be clearly identified.18−20 This is likely due to
the fact that the electroadhesion process contains structural and
electrical complexity, where the electrical voltage is applied to
the in-plane electrodes, but the electrical potential fields propagate
in the perpendicular direction, and, as a result, generate the induced
charges on the attached object.

The electroadhesive force being
generated on the insulating substrate
is mainly derived from electric fields and polarizations.21 More specifically, the interfacial polarization
and orientational polarization is the main contribution of generating
electroadhesive force.22,23 Note that the “interfacial
polarization” specifically occurs in heterogenous systems and
consists two or more phases. The space-charge build-up is observed
at the macroscopic interfaces from the difference in permittivities
and conductivities of constituents.24,25 The electroadhesive
device uses the induced polarization of molecules or accumulation
of charged particles (ions or charged moieties) formed at the interface
between the object and the device. Subsequently, the induced polarization
generates the electrostatic force (or Maxwell force) in the perpendicular
direction between the electrode and the object, which take counter
charges, and, as a result, attractive forces (see Figure 1a). The electroadhesive device
is usually composed of three layers: a flexible support layer, interdigitated
electrodes, and an insulation layer. As seen in the front and side
views of the electroadhesive device in Figure 1a, the interdigitated alternating electrodes
are constructed on the supporting-layer surface, and subsequently
covered by an insulation layer. Electrical voltage is applied to the
interdigitated electrodes across the insulation layer, where the electrode
geometry can be specified by the width (TW) and space (TS). When the electrode
voltage is on, the electrostatic counter charge is induced at the
electrode-projected area of the object, and, consequently, the Maxwell
force is generated between these two counter charges. Figure 1b shows photographs demonstrating
our electroadhesive devices (Figure 1a) lifting three different objects made from paper,
glass, and metal. Three cans are held together by double-sided tape.
Although the same device (85 mm × 35 mm) and same voltage (1.3
kV) were used for this demonstration, the maximum lifting capability
is different for different object materials, seemingly because the
amount of induced charge is different for different object materials.

Figure 1 Schematic
of the electroadhesive device and demonstrations. (a)
Front and side views of the device. (b) Photographs of lifting various
objects with the device (paper, glass, and metal).

Because a Maxwell force is generated between the
electrode areas
and electrode-projected area each taking counter ions, the electrode
pattern and electrode-surface area have been considered important
in the design of the electrode device. In this sense, the areal shear
lifting forces were compared for the one-body electrode and the comb-type
electrode (i.e., interdigitated electrode) both having the same surface
of electrodes, and the interdigitated one always gave higher lifting
forces and shorter polarization times.5,6,26,27 It can be very clearly
demonstrated by a simple experiment, where a one-body electrode (i.e.,
no interdigitated pattern) provides a very low lifting force.

To date, electrostatic force has been considered proportional to
the electrode area, which is likely to be equivalent to the electrode-projected
area on the object. However, this assumption may be contradictory
to the experimental evidence of a one-body electrode giving a lower
areal lifting force than the interdigitated electrode one.6 Accordingly, it may be reasonable to suspect
the assumption that the counter charges should be induced and distributed
in a uniform fashion in the electrode-projected area of the object.
In fact, the equipotential field may well propagate in a hemispherical
shape, as can be seen in Figure 1a.23 The feature of this
equipotential field is most likely to give different potential values
at different positions on the projected area of the objects because
the equipotential distance should be different. Hence, we believe
that the key issue in the design of the electroadhesive device is
clarifying the way that the induced charges could be distributed on
the object-surface positions. In this study, we propose that the induced
charges should be preferably accumulated at specific locations where
the equipotential distance is minimum, which can be quantified to
express the lifting forces as a function of the electrode geometry.
This will be demonstrated and discussed later in this paper.

The electroadhesive force which increases with the magnitude of
the electric field is crucial in electroadhesion, and there are many
factors that govern the electroadhesive force including the material
properties (dielectric thickness, permittivity, and voltage breakdown),
structural properties (magnitude of polarized impedance, electrode
geometry, surface roughness, and boundary edge length), and external
stimuli (voltage and current). However, the effect of the electrode
geometry has not been investigated well.18,28 Hence, the electrode geometry (different TW and TS) of the interdigitated
pattern and impedance of the electroadhesive device in the presence
of various objects are examined in this study to be correlated with
the electroadhesive force. In this study, we fabricated three-layer
structures of the electroadhesive device including the rectangular-shape
interdigitated patterns of electrodes (Figure 1a), and measured the areal lifting forces
for different objects made from paper, glass, and metal, with respect
to different sizes of width (TW), space
(TS), and the occupied surface area of
the electrode. The areal lifting forces were correlated with the key
design factors of the electrode geometry, which was resultantly identified
as the total boundary-edge length of the electrodes. By measuring
the impedance of the device in the presence of the attached objects,
we developed a methodology to identify the different areal lifting
forces for different object materials that are closely associated
with the induced permittivity of the objects.

Experimental Section
Materials
A polyimide (PI) film was used as a flexible
supporting layer. Copper-clad PI films were purchased from South Korea
H&C PCB Co., Ltd., with copper thickness of 35 μm and PI
film of 33 μm. Anionic waterborne polyurethane (WPU) was obtained
from South Korea Youngjin Texchem Co., Ltd., and used for the insulation
layer in this study.

Fabrication of the Electroadhesive Device
The copper
electrode was patterned using photolithography. Then, the electrode-patterned
PI film was coated by WPU as an insulation layer using a micro dip-coater
(EF-3100) at the elevation rate of 3 mm/s. The WPU was repeatedly
coated 3–4 times to acquire the desired thickness of 20 μm.
The device size was (85 mm × 35 mm), and Table 1 summarizes the detailed electrode geometry
of TS and TW investigated in this study.

Lifting Shear Force Test
The adhesive
lifting test
of the device was conducted for various objects (paper, glass, and
metal) using a force gauge (FG-5005). The electroadhesive device was
connected to the force gauge with a mechanical clamp, which was pulled
upward in the measurement of the lifting forces in the shearing mode
using the applied dc voltages of 1, 1.5, and 2 kV. The areal adhesion
force, which refers to the adhesion force per unit area (mm2), was measured, until it reached the voltage breakdown.

Electrochemical
Impedance Analysis
The impedance analysis
was conducted by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The impedance
of the electroadhesive device and the device attached to the objects
(paper, glass, and metal) were measured using an impedance analyzer
[Bio-Logic Science, SP-150 under the voltage range −10 to 10
mV and frequency range 100 Hz to 1 MHz]. The impedance values measured
in the absence of the attached objects were used as a reference to
quantify the amount of induced charges and magnitude of polarizations
of the objects.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the
areal lifting force (or stress) measured for the electroadhesive devices
having different widths (TW) and spaces
(TS) of the electrodes and also comparing
different voltages of 1, 1.5, and 2 kV (see also Table 1 for the detailed geometry).
The adhesion force decreases with the increment of both TW and TS. A previous modeling
study of wall-climbing robots20 shows that
the adhesive force decreases with TW and TS. However, it should be mentioned that the
both TW and TS cannot decrease at the same time for a given device size. Accordingly,
this experimental evidence may not be practically applied for the
electrode design of electroadhesive devices because the electrodes
should be usually patterned in a given size of devices to carry out
the specific tasks of lifting.

Areal force measurement of the device plotted as a function of TS for fixed TW (1

According to the electrostriction
theory, Maxwell force is generated
between two in-plane electrodes and is proportional to the electrode
area (A), dielectric constant (ε), and voltage
(V) across the thickness of the dielectric layer
(d)19 1  

Although
this equation is not directly applicable to the geometry
of the electroadhesion devices, it may be reasonable to consider that
the electroadhesive force in the electrostrictive devices may well
be proportional to the electrode surface area contacting the objects
that should be lifted. Therefore, in this study, we defined the electrode
areal fraction (ΦA) as the electrode surface area
divided by the electroadhesive-device area (Table 1). Using the experimental results in Figure 2a,b, we plotted the
areal adhesion force as a function of the electrode areal fraction
(ΦA) for the paper object shown in Figure 2c. As can be seen, the result
is somewhat contradictory. The areal adhesion force increases with
ΦA, while TS decreases
from 2.5 to 0.5 mm; in contrast, it decreases, while TW increases. It does not comply with the assumption that
the electroadhesive force should be proportional to the electrode-occupied
area. This may demonstrate that ΦA is not the governing
factor in the electroadhesive device, nor is TW or TS.

Because neither
the electrode areal fraction nor TW (or TS) is the governing
factor of the electroadhesive force, detailed speculation on the fundamental
principles of the induced polarization and charge distribution may
be required. The equipotential field of the θ-component (Eθ) for the in-plane electrode arrangement
in Figure 3a can be
expressed by the Maxwell equation23 2  where (r) is the radius of
the concentric electric field, (θ) is the angle of equipotential
line, and U0 is the equipotential field.
According to eq 2, the
equipotential field is proportional to 1/r, which
would provide the maximum potential position appearing when the distance
(r) between the in-plane electrodes is the nearest,
that is, corresponding to the boundary edges of the electrodes. Accordingly,
the charge distribution developed on the object may well be seen in Figure 3a, which shows the
charge maximum appearing in the area of the boundary edges of the
electrodes. This may lead to the conclusion that the length of the
boundary edges is the crucial factor that resultantly controls the
lifting force of the electroadhesive device.

distributions generated by two in-plane
electrodes propagating in the out-of-plane direction resultantly giving
the maximum charges accumulated in the object areas corresponding
to the boundary edges of the electrodes. (b) Schematic of the in-plane
electrodes of the electroadhesive device defining the sizes (TWi, TLi, and TSi) used in the calculation of ΦBE in eq 3.

Hence, we defined the boundary-edge ratio, ΦBE, as the total boundary-edge lengths divided by the perimeter
of
the device size. It represents the whole boundary-edge lengths that
could generate the lifting force in the unit size of the device. For
the electrode geometry in Figure 3b, ΦBE can be evaluated as 3  where TWi, TLi, and TSi are
the width and length of the electrode and the space distance between
the adjacent electrodes, respectively. LM and LN represent the length and width
of the electroadhesive-device, which correspond to the device size. Table 1 summarizes the evaluated
ΦBE’s for our electrode systems used in this
study.

The areal adhesion forces (F, kPa) for
the different
electrode systems in Table 1 may be quantitatively represented by a model equation as
a function of ΦBE, applied voltage (V), and the impedance F0(|Z|), which is related to the capacitance reactance, resistance, and
inductance.29 The impedance can be correlated
with dielectric permittivity through the capacitance reactance.28 Accordingly, we propose an empirical model equation
containing three parameters (F0(Z), α, and β) as follows 4  

In eq 4, we separated
the variables of the polarization |Z|, voltage (V), and boundary edge length, ΦBE as F0(|Z|), H(V), and G(ΦBE). Fitting our experimental
results in Table 1 using eq 4, the obtained model parameter F0(|Z|) varies depending on
the various objects, and is 0.24 for paper, 0.3 for glass, and 0.7
for metal, where α = 1, β = 0.02, which are compared in Figure 4a,b. Similar phenomena
of parameters of the empirical equation depending on the different
objects can also be seen in another study.30 The magnitude of polarized impedance |Z| of our
electroadhesive device will be further measured and discussed later
in this paper. As can be seen, the model eq 4 compares well with the experimental data
for all interdigitated patterns and voltages of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0
kV investigated for the paper object in this study (Table 1). This clearly shows that the
areal adhesion force is correlated with the boundary length regardless
of TW or TS for different voltages in the range 1–2 kV. This model is
restricted to be used in the range of 2 kV as the allowable voltage
for our electroadhesive device is 2 kV without voltage breakdown.
The highest areal adhesion force is achieved at 8.74 kPa when ΦBE is the highest at 14.93, which corresponds to the interdigitated
pattern of TW and TS at 0.5 and 1.0 mm, respectively. Hence, it is clear that
the induced polarization is locally concentrated at the boundary edge
of the electrodes, and, conclusively, the lifting force is expressed
by ΦBE complying well with eq 4.

contains the interdigitated pattern of TW or TS at 0.5 and 1.0 mm among various
objects (paper, glass and metal) with different voltages.

Different object materials give different lifting
forces exerted
by the same electroadhesive device because the charge induction could
be different. Figure 4b shows the areal adhesion forces measured for different objects
made from paper, metal, and glass as a function of the applied voltages.
As can be seen in Figure 4b, the areal adhesion forces achievable for the metal, glass,
and paper objects are 14.6, 10.8, and 8.74 kPa at 1, 1.8, and 2.0
kV, respectively. The achievable voltages for different objects are
different because of the voltage breakdown. The electroadhesive force
of metal objects has been reported to be relatively high, but it is
limited by the applied voltages due to the electrode voltage breakdown
or safety issues. The large quantity of the induced charges developed
on the metal object seems to result in the high adhesion force, compared
with other objects. The electroadhesive force of the glass objects
well exceeds the areal adhesion forces that were reported previously
as 4.1 kPa at 4 kV.5 The paper objects
are the most difficult ones to pick up, although they are the most
popular ones, for example, in warehouse picking applications. The
areal lifting force of paper objects obtained in our study is 8.74
kPa, which is far above the reported values in the open literature:
(0.1–2.4) kPa for wall-climbing robot,5,20 2.5
kPa for stretchable robots,19 and 2.5 kPa
for the dielectric elastomer actuator.6 The electroadhesive device shows different lifting capability depending
on the amount of polarized charges developed on the objects. As the
induced polarization between the device and objects increases, the
adhesion force would increase, which may subsequently increase the
lifting capability. The amount of induced charges for different materials
is likely the key quantity corresponding to the lifting capability,
but it has never been measured before.

In this study, we set
up an experiment to measure the induced charges
for different objects comparing the complex impedance values in the
absence and presence of the attached objects. In the analysis of impedance
experiments, the ratio of applied voltage (V) to
current (I) is designated to be the impedance of
the system (Z), which is conducted over a broad range
of frequencies and gives significant electrochemical changes under
various frequency regions.31 Its magnitude
shows a complex notation that consists of a real part for resistors
and an imaginary part for capacitors. In this study, the Nyquist plot
of the electroadhesive device is compared with the cases where objects
are attached to the lifting device. In the Nyquist plot, the semicircle
of impedance reveals the circuit of a parallel resistor to the capacitor,32 and the charge transfer resistance (RCT) corresponds to the diameter of each semicircle,
also referred to as polarization.33 As
can be seen in Figure 5a, the Nyquist plot of the cases with the different objects (paper,
glass, and metal) are dramatically lower than that of the electroadhesive
device, which contains the interdigitated pattern of TW or TS at 0.5 and 1.0 mm.
This phenomenon can be illustrated due to the presence of the induced
charges developed on the objects. In addition, according to Figure 5a, the value of RCT clearly decreases as objects are attached
in situ on the electroadhesive device in the order of paper, glass,
and metal [(4.2, 3.7 and 2.7) × 106]. This clarifies
that the measured charges in this experiment represent the mobility
not only for the charge transfer from the device to the object but
also for the polarization developed on the objects. Hence, the highest
charge mobilities generated in the metal seem to correspond to the
highest amount of induced charges, which subsequently agrees well
with the highest adhesion force among the three objects in this study
(see Figure 4b).

Figure 5 Electrochemical
impedance analysis. (a) Nyquist model of impedance
of the electroadhesive device and objects attached. (b) Impedance
magnitude analysis of the electroadhesive device and attached objects.

Figure 5b shows
the impedance magnitude |Z| of our electroadhesive
device in the presence of the attached objects. It decreases exponentially,
and eventually tapers off to zero for all cases of different objects
in the high-frequency region. This illustrates that the induced charges
do not seem to develop on the objects in the high-frequency region,
that is, >105 Hz. The impedance behavior clearly shows
a capacitive behavior in the range 100–1000 Hz, and a resistive
behavior over 1000 Hz seemingly corresponding to a transition phase.34 In the operation and design of the electroadhesive
devices, the low-frequency behavior is important because the polarized
charges can be developed in the range of a few seconds.

One
way to quantify the amount of induced polarized charges, which
is proportional to the lifting forces, may well be represented by
the value of the dielectric permittivity. In the theory of impedance
and dielectric permittivity, the magnitude of impedance |Z|, which is dependent on the frequency is inversely proportional
to the dielectric permittivity (ϵ′) viz.29 5  where inductive reactance (XL) = 2πfL, capacitance reactance
(XC) = 1/2πfC,
and dielectric permittivity (ϵ′) = Cd/ϵ0A. The R, f, L, C, d, ϵ0, and A are the resistance, frequency, inductance, capacitance, thickness,
vacuum permittivity and contact area, respectively. As clearly expressed
in eq 5, the magnitude
of impedance is proportional to the capacitive reactance and material
properties of dielectric permittivity in eq 5.

The value of |Z|
clearly decreases in the order
of without object, paper, glass,
and metal. Accordingly, it may demonstrate that the dielectric permittivity
of the device with the metal object is higher than that of the device
with glass or paper. In addition, it should be addressed that the
metal object contains a large amount of free electron carriers of
ca. 1022 to 1023 cm–3, which
may well allow easy and fast reassembly and accumulation of a large
quantity of induced charged particles, compared with other objects.35 We believed that the measured |Z| is closely associated with the electroadhesive force, specially, F0(|Z|) in eq 4. The F0(|Z|) for paper, glass, and metal are determined as 0.24,
0.3, and 0.7, respectively, which is in the same order of magnitude
of |Z| in Figure 5b. Consequently, our experiment clearly demonstrates
that the amount of induced polarization can be quantified by the impedance
measurement and analysis for different objects, which can be subsequently
correlated to the electroadhesive force.

Conclusions
An
electroadhesive device of three-layer structure was fabricated,
and the picking capability of various objects (glass, paper, and metal)
demonstrated. We identified that the induced charges were concentrated
on the boundary edges of the electrodes, as the amount of induced
charges was maximized when the distance of the equipotential fields
became minimum. On the basis of this finding, we proposed a model
that allowed the electroadhesive forces to be predicted as a function
of the ratio of the boundary edges length and impedance. In addition,
the amount of induced charges and the magnitude of polarizations developed
in different objects were measured and correlated with the electroadhesive
forces. Our modeling and experimental methodology of the electroadhesive
device should bring us one step closer to the human-hand robot gripper.
