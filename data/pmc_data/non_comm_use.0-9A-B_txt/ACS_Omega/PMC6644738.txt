A detailed
theoretical analysis of the mechanism and chemoselectivity
for gold(I)-catalyzed reaction of o-(alkynyl)styrene
containing an isopropyl and a methyl at the terminal position of the
alkene has been reported in this work. Two different counterions (SbF6– and OTs–) were studied
as model catalysts. According to our calculation, for SbF6–, the reaction pathway is more prone to direct
1,2-H shifts (isopropyl H) than the elimination and ring expansion
pathway. However, an elimination pathway affords the indenyl derivative
by forming p-toluenesulfonic acid (HOTs), which may be the main pathway
in the presence of OTs–. The chemoselectivity for
the title reaction is mainly determined by the electronic effect of
the counterion and the substituent rather than the steric effect.
In other words, less basic SbF6– mainly
provides the charge separation effect rather than assisted proton
elimination. However, the more basic OTs– mainly
assist proton elimination through the formation of HOTs. In addition
to the good agreement with the experimental data, the density functional
theory results also provide a significant contribution to the understanding
of the reaction mechanism.

1 Introduction
Gold(I)
catalysis is currently recognized as one of the hot topics
in organic synthesis.1 New methods based
on gold catalysis has not only become an experimental research field2 but also a major field of theoretical research.3 For gold-mediated transformations of alkynes,
the cationic gold system is a commonly used type of catalyst that
is primarily prepared by the metathesis reaction between the simple
gold complex LAuCl and the silver salt AgX (X: “noncoordinating”
counterion). Various anions (such as SbF6–, NTf2–, OTs–, and
OTf–) can be applied in the gold catalytic system.4 Compared with a large number of effort on understanding
the effects of ligands,5 it is only recently
that chemists have begun to study the effect of counterions on determining
the reaction pathway in the gold-catalyzed reactions. In fact, counterions
often play an important role in reactions involving cationic species.
The counterion was generally considered to be an important factor
in the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the reaction.4 1,3-Dien-5-ynes, including ortho-(alkynyl)styrenes, have been broadly used as starting materials
for the synthesis of a wide variety of carbo- and heterocycles.6 For example, several groups reported the skeleton
rearrangement reaction of several metal-catalyzed α-substituted
and mono- or non-β-substituted o-(alkynyl)styrenes.7 In these studies, the more common examples are
the 6-endo cyclization with only a small amount of 5-exo adducts.7h In addition, 5-endo adduct was also detected.
Recently, a series of gold-catalyzed reaction of ortho-(alkynyl)styrenes to form different products has been reported by
the Sanz group.8 These experimental results
show that the olefin substitution pattern is crucial for the ring
isomerization of ortho-(alkynyl)styrenes. Among these
studies, the recent reaction of o-(alkynyl)styrenes
from the Sanz group envisioned that naphthalene derivatives (6-endo-cyclization)
are isolated in high yield for α-substituted (R1 =
Me) o-(phenylethynyl)styrenes under the conditions
of [AuCl (Ph3P)]/AgSbF6 catalysis. However,
β, β-disubstituted (R2 = R3 = Me) o-(phenylethynyl)styrenes give indenyl derivatives in very
high yields.8d Under the conditions of
[AuCl(Ph3P)]/AgSbF6 catalysis, a new reaction
pathway was successfully achieved for o-(alkynyl)styrene
containing an isopropyl and a methyl at the terminal position of the
alkene. Interestingly, changing the catalyst to [AuCl(Ph3P)]/AgOTs will result in the formation of the indenyl derivative
product (Scheme 1).8e According to the experiment results, Sanz et
al.8d,8e proposed three possible pathways including
elimination, ring expansion, and 1,2-H shift to explain experimental
facts (Scheme 2). In
our previous work, the regioselectivity in the [AuCl(Ph3P)]/AgSbF6-catalyzed cycloisomerization of α-substituted
and β, β-disubstituted o-(phenylethynyl)styrenes
has been employed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
In addition, a novel reaction pathway for elimination of protons involving
the four-center-three-electron intermediate is located from our calculations.9 In this work, our aim is mainly focused on the
effect of counterions in the chemoselectivity. Experimental facts
show that the chemoselectivity of o-(alkynyl)styrene
containing an isopropyl and a methyl at the terminal position of the
alkene is entirely controlled by the counterion. That is, under the
conditions of [AuCl(Ph3P)]/AgSbF6 catalysis,
1,2-H shift is the main reaction pathway. An elimination pathway for
the formation of the indenyl derivative may be the main pathway in
the presence of [AuCl(Ph3P)]/AgOTs. In the present work,
we will pursue a detailed DFT investigation of the title reaction
to explore the different role of SbF6– and OTs– in the determination of the chemoselectivity.
We believe that the calculation results provided in this study are
very important for a better understanding of the gold(I)-catalyzed
reaction of o-(alkynyl)styrene containing an isopropyl
and a methyl at the terminal position of the alkene. In addition,
it also offers some new insights into the generation of chemoselectivity
under different counterions.

2 Results and Discussion
In our DFT calculations, o-(alkynyl)styrene containing
an isopropyl and a methyl at the terminal position of the alkene were
used as model substrates.a H3PAuSbF6 (series A) and H3PAuOTs (series B) were selected as model catalysts.bFigures 1, 2, 3, and 4 show the energy profiles for series A and B along with selected structures and key geometry parameters
(e.g., bond lengths). The detailed structural parameters and energies
for the structures determined here are given in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 Full energy profile calculated of the
first step for series A and B with selected
structures (selected bond
lengths are in Å). Relative energies are expressed in kcal/mol.

2.1 Computational Results for
H3PAuSbF6-Catalyzed Reaction (Series A)
The first
step of the series A forms a stable intermediate A-1 in which the
Au atom is coordinated with the π-bond of the alkyne moiety.
The bond lengths of the two Au–C bonds in A-1 are
2.370 and 2.346 Å. In fact, the C≡C coordination to gold
enhances the electrophilicity of the C≡C bond.10 The next step for intramolecular nucleophilic attack of
the olefin will form a cationic intermediate A-2 through A-TS1.c The free energies of activation
for this step is 8.9 kcal/mol for A-TS1 (Figure 1). In addition, the 5-exo-dig
can also provide another possible reaction pathway. The free energies
of activation for this pathway are 22.9 kcal/mol. Higher activation
energy indicates that 5-exo-dig cyclization is unfavorable. After
formation of A-2, without the assistance of SbF6–, the next step would afford enyne intermediates A-2a or A-2d via the direct 1,4-H shift (H on
methyl or isopropyl) process. The calculated free energy barrier of
the direct 1,4-H shift process was as high as 30.3 and 31.8 kcal/mol
for A-TSe1 (H on isopropyl) and A-TSf1 (H
on methyl), respectively (Figure S2, Supporting Information). These values indicated that the direct proton
transfer pathway is not possible under experimental conditions. However,
experimental results obviously revealed that minor (10%) products
of the indenyl derivative would be generated from the elimination
pathway.8e Following our previous work,9 the reaction pathway for elimination of protons
assisted by SbF6– was also located in
our present calculation. The calculated free energy barriers for A-TSa1 (H on isopropyl) and A-TSd1 (H on methyl)
are 12.9 and 13.8 kcal/mol, respectively (Figure 2). This calculation shows that A-TSa1 and A-TSd1 have relatively lower free energy, which makes elimination
pathways possible. Subsequently, indene A-3a and A-3d would be generated via protodemetalation and 1,2-H shift,
in addition to the regeneration of the gold catalyst. The activation
free energies of these steps are 1.4 and 11.1 and −0.4 and
11.3 kcal/mol for A-TSa2 and A-TSa3 and A-TSd2 and A-TSd3, respectively. For A-TSd2, the activation free energy is negative, which may be mainly because A-1d is stabilized by π···H···F
weak interactions and is more inclined to form more stable intermediates.
The complete catalytic processes are exothermic by −23.6 and
−19.9 kcal/mol lower than A-1. Apart from the
elimination pathways, intermediate A-2 could also undergo
a direct 1,2-H shift, Friedel–Crafts-type alkylation and protodemetalation
furnishes final product (pathway b). First, the direct
1,2-H (H on methyl) shift was performed. Consistent with previous
results,9 the activation energy for this
pathway is as high as 31.8 kcal/mol (Figure S2, Supporting Information), which revealed that the formation
of the product via pathway b is not favorable. Subsequently,
we turn our attention to the direct 1,2-H shift on isopropyl groups.
Because of the different migration directions, two different chiral
products (Syn or Anti) would be formed in
this pathway. Figure 3 shows that the calculated free energy barriers
for the direct 1,2-H (H on isopropyl) shift are 11.8 and 12.9 kcal/mol
for Syn-A-TSb1 and Anti-A-TSb1, respectively.
In addition, the free energies of the reaction for Syn-A-1b and Anti-A-1b are 4.2 and 7.1 kcal/mol with respect
to A-2, respectively. Subsequent Friedel–Crafts-type
alkylation reaction of Syn-A-1b and Anti-A-1b would afford the dihydrobenzo[a]fluorene derivative Syn-A-2b and Anti-A-2b through Syn-A-TSb2 and Anti-A-TSb2. The calculated free activation energies
for Friedel–Crafts-type alkylation reaction are 4.8 and 3.0
kcal/mol for Syn and Anti, respectively.
Next, Syn-A-2b and Anti-A-2b undergoes protodemetalation,
affording the final product Syn-A-3b and Anti-A-3b with a barrier of 8.6 and 9.8 kcal/mol for Syn and Anti, respectively. In addition, the formation of Syn-A-3b and Anti-A-3b is strongly exergonic by 37.0 and 35.4
kcal/mol for Syn and Anti, respectively.
For pathway c, the corresponding 6-endo-cyclization products
will be formed by ring expansion. The calculated free activation energy
for ring expansion is 19.9 kcal/mol (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Higher activation energies observed
for this step indicate that the pathway for 6-endo is unfavorable.9

Figure 2 Full energy profile calculated for series A via path a and d with selected structures
(selected bond
lengths are in Å). Relative energies are expressed in kcal/mol.

Figure 3 Full energy profile calculated for series A via path b with selected structures (selected
bond lengths are in Å).
Relative energies are expressed in kcal/mol.

An overview of all the reaction pathways of the series A reveals that the final product is determined by A-TSa1, A-TSb1 (Syn and Anti), and A-TSd1. The calculated free energies of activation are 12.9,
11.8, 12.9, and 13.8 kcal/mol for A-TSa1, Syn-A-TSb1, Anti-A-TSb1, and A-TSd1, respectively.
Relatively lower free energies of activation observed for Syn-A-TSb1 compared with those of A-TSa1, Anti-A-TSb1, and A-TSd1 indicated that the direct 1,2-H (H on isopropyl)
shift pathway would predominantly take place to finally produce Syn-A-3b. Furthermore, relatively small free energies of activation
difference (1.1, 1.1, and 2.0 kcal/mol) between Syn-A-TSb1 and A-TSa1 and Anti-A-TSb1 and A-TSd1 means that the Anti-A-3b and indenyl derivatives A-3a and A-3d would be generated as byproducts.
Our calculations are completely consistent with the experimental observations.8e In addition, the lower barriers are found for
direct 1,2-H shift (H on isopropyl), mainly because of the following
reasons. First, in the presence of less basic SbF6–, the elimination pathway is an abnormal reaction pathway
through a four-center-three-electron structure instead of forming
HSbF6, which makes SbF6–-assisted
migration efficiency relatively low. The second and most important
reason is that the structure of the direct 1,2-H shift transition
state can be stabilized by the presence of two methyl groups in the
isopropyl group, which can greatly reduce the free energies of activation.
This conclusion can also be proved from the high free energies of
activation of 1,2-H shift (H on methyl). Third, because of the presence
of ions, the charge separation effect in the solution is more obvious,
and it also contributes to the reduction of the free energies of activation
of 1,2-H shift.

2.2 Computational Results for
H3PAuOTs-Catalyzed
Reaction
Similar to series A, the first step
for series B also led to the formation B-1 in which the Au atom is coordinated with the π-bond of the
alkyne moiety. Next, cationic intermediate B-2 will be
formed by intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the olefin (B-TS1). This step requires free energies of activation of
8.1 kcal/mol (Figure 1). The relatively small difference in free energies of activation
between A-TS1 and B-TS1 indicates that the
counterion has almost no effect on this step. For 5-exo-dig cyclization
pathway of series B, the calculated free energy of activation
is 24.3 kcal/mol. This value also disclosed that 5-exo-dig cyclization
is unfavorable. After the formation of B-2, three basic
possible pathways can also be envisioned. Because the free energies
of activation for direct 1,4-H shift are very high, only the counterion-assisted
proton elimination pathway is considered. Unlike SbF6–, OTs–-assisted proton elimination
is a classic elimination reaction that forms p-toluenesulfonic acid
(HOTs). Figure 4 shows that the calculated free energy barriers
are 11.9 and 11.0 kcal/mol for B-TSa1 (H on isopropyl)
and B-TSd1 (H on methyl), respectively. The formation
of B-1a and B-1d is an exothermic process,
and the energies of the reaction are −12.0 and −14.7
kcal/mol with respect to B-2, respectively. The subsequent
protodemetalation and regeneration of the gold catalyst require activation
energies of 3.7 and 9.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Similarly, intermediate B-2 could also undergo a direct 1,2-H shift pathway (pathway b). Because of the high free energies of activation of 1,2-H
shift (H on methyl), only 1,2-H (H on isopropyl) shift was calculated
in our calculation. Figure 4 shows that the calculated free energy barriers for the direct
1,2-H shift on isopropyl groups are 15.6 and 17.7 kcal/mol for Syn-B-TSb1 and Anti-B-TSb1, respectively. Relatively
higher free activation energies observed for this step indicate that
the direct 1,2-H shift (H on isopropyl) is not favorable. For pathway c, the calculated free activation energies for the ring expansion
pathway is as high as 22.4 kcal/mol for B-TSc1, which
revealed that the 6-endo is also unfavorable. The overall analysis
of the potential energy surface of the series B shows
the final product would evolve through the elimination pathway to
afford mixed indenyl derivative B-2a and B-2d. On the basis of our calculation results, in the presence of more
basic OTs–, the elimination pathway is a classic
reaction pathway to form HOTs and is a strongly exothermic process
with relatively low activity energy. In addition, the direct 1,2-H
shift transition state can also be stabilized by the presence of two
methyl groups in the isopropyl group, and the charge separation ability
of OTs– in solution is weaker than that of SbF6–, resulting in higher free activation energies
for direct 1,2-H shift of series B.

Figure 4 Full energy profile calculated for series B with selected
structures (selected bond lengths are in Å). Relative energies
are expressed in kcal/mol.

2.3 Role of SbF6– and OTs–
According to our calculated
results, the chemoselectivity of o-(alkynyl)styrene
containing an isopropyl and a methyl at the terminal position of the
alkene is mainly controlled by the electronic effect of the counterion
and substituent rather than the steric effect. In the presence of
less basic SbF6–, the elimination path
through the four-center-three-electron intermediate indeed can be
observed in our calculation. However, the elimination pathway is an
abnormal reaction pathway, which makes SbF6–-assisted migration efficiency relatively low. In contrast, because
of the presence of two methyl groups in the isopropyl group and strong
charge separation effects, the direct 1,2-H shift would be the most
favorable pathway. In other words, SbF6– mainly provides the charge separation effect rather than assisting
proton elimination. Under the presence of more basic OTs–, a classic reaction pathway to form HOTs was located and was a strongly
exothermic process with relatively low activity energy. Although the
direct 1,2-H shift transition state can also be stabilized by the
presence of two methyl groups in the isopropyl group, the charge separation
ability of OTs– in solution is weaker than that
of SbF6–, resulting in relatively higher
free activation energies for direct 1,2-H shift of series B. This fact can also be confirmed by the NBO charge of A-2 and B-2. The NBO charges for the F and O atoms are
−0.498 and −0.669 au for A-2 and B-2, respectively. Larger negative charges found for the O
atom of A-2 suggest that it is easier for OTs– to eliminate protons. Furthermore, because of the extremely high
acidity of HSbF6, the formation of HSbF6 is
not possible; only the elimination path through the four-center-three-electron
can be located. However, the more basic OTs– easily
assist proton elimination through the formation of HOTs. Our calculations
are completely consistent with the experimental observations.8e

3 Conclusions
In summary,
the mechanism and chemoselectivity for gold(I)-catalyzed
reaction of o-(alkynyl)styrene containing an isopropyl
and a methyl at the terminal position of the alkene are employed by
the DFT calculations. On the basis of our calculations, we can draw
the following conclusions:1 Calculation results clearly show that
the direct 1,2-H shift (H on isopropyl) is more favorable than the
elimination and ring expansion pathway for SbF6–. However, an elimination pathway affords the indenyl derivative
by forming HOTs, which is possibly the major pathway in the presence
of OTs–.

2 In the presence of less basic SbF6–,
the product has a relatively high stereoselectivity
and the major product was Syn-A-3b. The Anti-A-3b and indenyl derivative A-3a and A-3d would
be generated as the byproduct.

3 The chemoselectivity for the model reaction
is mainly controlled by the electronic effect of the counterion and
substituent rather than the steric effect. In other words, SbF6– mainly provides the charge separation
effect rather than assisted proton elimination. However, the more
basic OTs– mainly assist proton elimination through
the formation of HOTs.

4 For the direct 1,2-H shift, the presence
of two methyl groups in the isopropyl group would play a crucial role
in stabilizing the transitional structure. It can greatly reduce the
free energies of activation. This finding provides important results
on the effect of counterions in other gold(I) catalytic systems.



3.1 Computational Details
All calculations
were performed with the Gaussian 09 programs.11 In the calculation, the geometries of all structures were fully
optimized by using DFT12 of the M06-2X
method.13 In addition, the 6-31G (d, p)
basis set was selected for all atoms except for Au and Sb, for which
the cc-pVDZ-PP14 basis set (BSI) containing
an effective core relativistic pseudopotential was employed. Vibrational
frequency calculations done at the same level were used to characterize
all of the stationary points as either minima [the number of imaginary
frequencies (NIMAG = 0) or transition states (NIMAG = 1)]. Furthermore,
the solvent effect was considered by single-point calculations with
the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEFPCM)
in dichloromethane (ε = 8.93) at B3LYP-D315/6-311++G (d, p) [for Au and Sb, Def2-TZVPPD,16 (BSII) the balanced triple-ζ valence basis
set with double polarization and diffuse functions basis set were
used]. Radii and nonelectrostatic terms were used from the universal
solvation model developed by Truhlar and co-workers.17 Unless otherwise specified, all the relative free energies
discussed in the main text are calculated in solution (ΔGsol). The 3D molecular structures are generated
using CYL-view.18

cost,
the PPh3 ligand of gold is replaced with PH3. In the systems studied herein, PH3 is a model for PPh3 because of minimal steric effects, related to the low number
of ligands around the gold metal center (vide infra). To further consider
the effect of the ligand, the key step for all of the reaction pathways
of PPh3 was calculated. Figure S1 in the Supporting Information shows the energy profile for this process.
Calculation results revealed a marginal difference between PPh3 and PH3 for the systems studied herein.
