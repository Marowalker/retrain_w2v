Calcium
sulfate hemihydrate with different structures and morphologies
has a broad scope of applications. Herein, we reported a strategy
for nanosized calcium sulfate through room-temperature microemulsion
by using calcium carbonate and sulfuric acid. After characterizations,
it was indicated that the morphology of calcium sulfate products fabricated
could be changed and controlled using different surfactants TritonX-114,
SDBS, and CTAB by the microemulsion method. The method demonstrated
in this work would be a benefit for the synthesis of nanomaterials
with special structures in the future.

Introduction
Calcium sulfate as
a common mineral salt has been widely used in
molding, the construction industry, sewage purification, and drug
delivery due to its excellent workability, high strength, biocompatibility,
and biodegradability.1−5 As nanoscience and nanotechnology prosper today, many chemists,
materials scientists, and engineers have put in tremendous efforts
to understand new phenomena and develop technologies in nanomaterials.6,7 Major contributions to the development of nanomaterials have been
made by chemists working primarily on the theme of their nanostructures
and functionalization using both room-temperature solution-based routes
and thermodynamics methods.8,9 Calcium sulfate with
various morphologies and sizes has been gradually studied in recent
years.10−14 Kong et al.15 fabricated α-calcium
sulfate hemihydrate nanowires in reverse microemulsions, while α-calcium
sulfate hemihydrate nanowhiskers were reported by Hou and his partners.16 Zhang et al.17 reported
a method for α-calcium sulfate hemihydrate with a low aspect
ratio using high-gravity reactive precipitation combined with a salt
solution method at atmospheric pressure. Except for high-temperature
or pressurized solution-based routes, calcium sulfate nanomaterials
fabricated via room-temperature methods have still been challenges.

Microemulsion-based synthesis is a potential method without expensive
or specialized instruments, in contrast to several physical methods
such as plasma synthesis, ball milling, and chemical vapor deposition.18,19 Moreover, the microemulsion method is one kind of room-temperature
route that is exploited to tailor and remodel nanoparticles. Microemulsion
in solution acts as a dynamically stable phase, which mostly benefits
from different surfactants and external controllable driving fields
such as a mechanical or thermodynamic field.20,21 Microemulsions can be found in most surfactant systems in which
both oil and water diffusions are uninhibited and only moderately
reduced compared to that in single liquids. The knowledge of factors
for microemulsions enables one to choose surfactants for desired applications
especially in the synthesis of nanomaterials with controlled sizes
and shapes. From recent studies, different types of surfactants have
been used in microemulsion formation, which include anionic, cationic,
and nonionic surfactants.22,23 On the other hand,
the room-temperature microemulsion method for nanomaterials has potential
because of the confinement during the formation process of particles.
Crystal growth in microemulsions is also a complex process that involves
the interplay of crystal growth kinetics and thermodynamics in the
multiphase system.

Herein, calcium sulfate has been successfully
synthesized through
a room-temperature microemulsion method. During the synthesis of nanosized
calcium sulfate, three different types of surfactants have also been
studied in this work such as TritonX-114, SDBS, and CTAB, shown in Scheme 1. This work deepens
the strategies for nanosized calcium sulfate and presents interesting
applications in the future.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate
in the Presence of Different
Surfactants
Results and Discussion
Surfactants play a crucial role in stabilizing the immiscible oil/water
phase by lowering the interfacial tension to form microemulsions.
A variety of surfactants categorized as cationic, anionic, nonionic,
and zwitterionic depending on the type of charge on their head group
is known.24 During the synthesis of nanosized
calcium sulfate, cyclohexane and water work as a microemulsion system
with surfactants at room temperature. The formation and growth of
calcium sulfate through different surfactant-supported microemulsions
are shown in the TEM images in Figure 1. In TritonX-114-supported microemulsion, calcium sulfate
nanoparticles rapidly formed as nanocrystals with a size smaller than
5 nm, and the nanoparticles finally grew into a nanorod cluster with
a diameter of more than 100 nm as shown in Figure 1a,b. Because of the nonionic nature of TritonX-114,
the microemulsion played a role like nanoreactors, which restricted
the growth of calcium sulfate. Meanwhile, in the SDBS-supported microemulsion
process, calcium sulfate formed as nanowires, and then into clusters,
and finally into whiskers, as shown in Figure 1c,d, mainly because of the anionic nature
and functional groups of SDBS. In CTAB-supported microemulsion, calcium
sulfate formed a quasi-spherical structure and increased in size as
the particles grew. From the EDX spectra of those final products after
drying in a vacuum oven, all those products were calcium sulfate with
different surfactants on the final particles, shown in Figures S1 and S2. Combined with these TEM images,
they indicated that different surfactants might control the final
morphology of calcium sulfate in a room-temperature microemulsion-based
method.

Figure 1 TEM images of samples (a, b) CS-T, (c, d) CS-S, and (e, f) CS-C.

During synthesis, TritonX-114
acted as a nonionic surfactant in
the microemulsion system, which could form and stabilize the partial
environment during the reactions inside the microemulsion droplets,
while SDBS acted as an anionic surfactant, and CTAB acted as a cationic
surfactant.25,26 To gain information on the interactions
between surfactants and particles, FT-IR spectra of final products
were measured as shown in Figure 2. From Figure 2a, the bands at 3615, 3555, and 3398 cm–1 could be assigned to O–H stretching of the −OH groups
of TritonX-114 and crystal water segments of calcium sulfate. The
bands at 1656 and 1620 cm–1 could be assigned to
C–H stretching, which indicated the presence of the TritonX-114
surfactant on the surface of particles. The band at 1141 cm–1 could be assigned to ν3 SO42– stretching, and the bands at 666 and 595 cm–1 could
be assigned to ν4 SO42– stretching. Compared with Figure 2a, Figure 2b shows the bands at 3550 and 3416 cm–1,
which are assigned to O–H stretching of crystal water segments
of calcium sulfate. The bands at other peaks are attributed to the
same groups as those in Figure 2a. From Figure 2c, the band around 3400 cm–1 and the band at 1141,
666, and 595 cm–1 could be assigned to O–H
stretching and SO42– stretching. All
those FT-IR data confirmed that the phases of the final products were
calcium sulfate hemihydrate, which matched the recent report.15 The rigidity of the surfactant played a crucial
role in the morphology of the product formed as well as the surfactant
packing parameters and charge. It indicated that the interactions
between surfactants and calcium sulfate largely depended on the nature
of surfactants not only in the synthesis process of calcium sulfate
but also in the final particles.

Figure 2 FT-IR spectra of samples (a) CS-T, (b)
CS-S, and (c) CS-C.

The XRD pattern of samples
shown in Figure 3 confirmed
the formation of calcium sulfate
according to the pure calcium sulfate hemihydrate phase (JCPDS 041-0244)
with the characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.45, 31.27,
32.11, 38.67, 41.40, 43.45, 49.28, 52.27, 55.75, and 62.31°,
which could be indexed to (020), (204), (402), (024), (422), (033),
(424), (040), (240), and (244), respectively. It indicated that room-temperature
microemulsion synthesis of calcium sulfate gave a final product in
the calcium sulfate hemihydrate phase. Composed of water and cyclohexane
and surfactants, the microemulsion controls the growth of calcium
sulfate especially in a lattice structure.

Figure 3 XRD patterns of samples
(a) CS-T, (b) CS-S, and (c) CS-C.

The TG pattern in Figure 4 showed a weight loss when samples were heated to 200
°C,
which was assigned to the escape of crystal water after being dried
at 60 °C for 4 h. Figure 4 a–c shows weight losses of 7.45, 8.46, and 9.44 wt
%, respectively, which were assigned to the crystal water content
of calcium sulfate hemihydrate. It was noted that this value was different
from the crystal water content of 6.2 wt % in the pure calcium sulfate
hemihydrate phase. Combining this with XRD patterns and TEM images,
calcium sulfate through a room-temperature microemulsion method resulted
in different morphologies but was of the same phase as calcium sulfate
hemihydrate. It indicated that the room-temperature microemulsion
method was successfully used in fabricating calcium sulfate hemihydrate,
and the surfactants might work in the morphology control of calcium
sulfate.

Figure 4 TG patterns of samples (a) CS-T, (b) CS-S, and (c) CS-C.

The DSC pattern of samples presented one typical
hemihydrate crystal-water
removal profile, the weight loss starting with an endothermic reaction
with a peak temperature at 160.4 °C followed by an exothermic
reaction with a peak at 168 °C, shown in Figure 5c, which is a little different to those in Figure 5a,b. It indicated
the calcium sulfate the surfactants present on the surface of calcium
sulfate might affect the DSC pattern indirectly, which exothermic
reaction peak did not exist. Combining this with the XRD and TG pattern
of the samples, those samples were all found to be calcium sulfate
hemihydrate.

Figure 5 DSC patterns of samples (a) CS-T, (b) CS-S, and (c) CS-C.

To evaluate the water solubility
of calcium sulfates by different
surfactants, 0.3 g of calcium sulfates was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized
water, and the electrical conductance was recorded immediately as
shown in Figure 6.
At the first step of dissolution, the electrical conductance of all
calcium sulfate samples was linear with R2 ≈ 1 in the first 400 s. It indicated that during the synthesis
of calcium sulfate, surfactants might affect the crystallization structure,
which resulted in water dissolution according to the electrical conductance
data.

and (c) CS-C) dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water.

Conclusions
In this work, nanosized
calcium sulfate hemihydrate has been successfully
fabricated through a room-temperature microemulsion method using calcium
carbonate and sulfuric acid. Compared with different surfactants,
TritonX-114, SDBS, and CTAB had taken advantage of the microemulsion
method as well as the microenvironment during the reactions which
finally fabricated nanosized calcium sulfate hemihydrate but with
different morphologies. The control strategy provided an efficient
and stable way of fabricating nanosized calcium sulfate hemihydrate
and may be used for the synthesis of nanomaterials with a special
structure in the future.

Materials and Method
Materials
Analytical
reagent-grade calcium carbonate
(CaCO3, 99.7%), sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS,
99.7%), polyoxyethylene mono-tert-octyl phenyl ether
(TritonX-114, 99.7%), and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB, 99.7%)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cyclohexane (99.5%), sulfuric acid
(H2SO4, 99.5%), and anhydrous ethanol (99.5%)
were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. All reagents were
used as received without further treatments. Deionized water was distilled
with a Milli-Q water purification system.

Preparation of Nanosized
Calcium Sulfate by Surfactant TritonX-114
Following recent
reports,18,27 nanosized calcium sulfate
was prepared. First, 3 mL of 5 wt % TritonX-114 was dissolved in 20
mL of cyclohexane and stirred for 30 min, and 10 mL of 30 wt % H2SO4 aqueous solution was added into the mixture
and continuously stirred for 3 h. Then, 0.3 g of CaCO3 was
added and continuously stirred for another 30 min. The suspension
was centrifuged and washed immediately with anhydrous ethanol three
times. The solid products were collected after being dried at 60 °C
in a vacuum oven for 4 h, which were named CS-T.

Morphology
Control of Nanosized Calcium Sulfate by Surfactants
SDBS and CTAB
During this step, the process was the same
as the preparation of nanosized calcium sulfate by surfactant TritonX-114;
however, SDBS or CTAB was individually used as the surfactant instead
of TritonX-114. The final solid products finally collected were named
CS-S or CS-C.

Characterization
For transmission
electron microscopy
(TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, the samples were recorded
on a field-emission transmission electron microscope (JoelJEM-2001F)
to measure the size and size distribution of particles by depositing
them on carbon-coated copper grids (holey carbon, 200 mesh Cu) and
leaving them to dry at room temperature. Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns were acquired on a D/MaxIIIA (Rigaku) diffractometer
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) in a 2θ
range from 5 to 80° at a scan rate of 0.02° per step. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed
using a simultaneous thermal analyzer (STA 499C, Netzsch) at a heating
rate of 10 °C·min–1 in a flowing nitrogen
atmosphere from room temperature to 800 °C. Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained on an FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet
iS50) using KBr pellets. The electrical conductance (EC) was recorded
on an EC meter (DDSJ-308F).
