The trafficking chaperone PDE6D (also referred to as
PDEδ)
has been nominated as a surrogate target for K-Ras4B (hereafter K-Ras).
Arl2-assisted unloading of K-Ras from PDE6D in the perinuclear area
is significant for correct K-Ras localization and therefore activity.
However, the unloading mechanism also leads to the undesired ejection
of PDE6D inhibitors. To counteract ejection, others have recently
optimized inhibitors for picomolar affinities; however, cell penetration
generally seems to remain an issue. To increase resilience against
ejection, we engineered a “chemical spring” into prenyl-binding
pocket inhibitors of PDE6D. Furthermore, cell penetration was improved
by attaching a cell-penetration group, allowing us to arrive at micromolar
in cellulo potencies in the first generation. Our model compounds,
Deltaflexin-1 and -2, selectively disrupt K-Ras, but not H-Ras membrane
organization. This selectivity profile is reflected in the antiproliferative
activity on colorectal and breast cancer cells, as well as the ability
to block stemness traits of lung and breast cancer cells. While our
current model compounds still have a low in vitro potency, we expect
that our modular and simple inhibitor redesign could significantly
advance the development of pharmacologically more potent compounds
against PDE6D and related targets, such as UNC119 in the future.

==== Body
Introduction
The oncogene Ras is one of the best-established
cancer targets
without an approved inhibitor. Ras drug development efforts in the
1990s were thwarted by the failure of farnesyltransferase inhibitors
(FTI) in clinical trials.1 At that time,
it was underappreciated that the highly mutated K-Ras and N-Ras can
be alternatively prenylated by geranylgeranyltransferase I, reinstating
Ras plasma membrane localization and thus activity, even in the presence
of FTIs.2

Recently, there has been
a resurgence in Ras drug development,
with both direct and indirect targeting approaches.3 The Shokat group has pioneered direct, covalent inhibitors
that target a switch II pocket in GDP-bound K-RasG12C.4 Efficacy of these compounds relies on the intrinsic GTPase
activity of that mutant and trapping of an inhibitor-bound inactive
state.5 Therefore, inhibitor efficacy can
be increased by enriching the cellular pool of GDP-bound K-RasG12C,
such as through inhibition of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g.,
EGFR, FGFR1, AXL) or Ras/Sos1 inhibitors, such as BAY-293.6

Switch II pocket inhibitors have rapidly
evolved7 and are now in clinical trials.8 Thus, it is for the first time possible to assess
the effect of
selectively targeting a driver oncogene. While lung cancer patient
data are encouraging, the durable responses and adaptive immunity
that is seen in animal models are striking and may indicate the significance
of K-Ras inhibition for curing cancer.

Given that other mutant
K-Ras alleles are not targeted by these
covalent inhibitors, different K-Ras inhibition approaches are still
needed. Therefore, other noncovalent Ras binders with inhibitory potential
remain interesting. They were typically discovered by computational
approaches, such as the Kobe-compounds or pyrazolopyrimidine allosteric
compounds, which block Ras-effector interaction and have micromolar
cellular potencies.9,10

The indirect target PDE6D
is a trafficking chaperone of farnesylated
proteins, which may suggest that its inhibition affects the same clients
as inhibition of farnesyltransferase. However, PDE6D has a different
client profile than farnesyltransferase, as it cannot facilitate intracellular
diffusion of proteins that are also palmitoylated.11,12 Moreover, PDE6D has the potential to accommodate geranyl-geranylated
clients.12 Thus, PDE6D inhibition selectively
affects K-Ras4B (hereafter K-Ras) trafficking but has much less effect
on trafficking of dual-palmitoylated H-Ras.11,13

In order to relay signaling, K-Ras needs to be localized predominantly
to the plasma membrane. This requires energy-dependent vesicular transport
of K-Ras to the plasma membrane from the recycling endosome, where
it is collected after PDE6D-assisted diffusion from internal cellular
membranes.11,13 Unloading of K-Ras from PDE6D
in the perinuclear compartment requires the binding of GTP-Arl2 to
PDE6D, which results in an allosteric conformational change in PDE6D
that effectively releases its cargo.14 Unfortunately,
this ejection mechanism also applies to the first two generations
of PDE6D inhibitors Deltarasin15 and Deltazinone,16 developed by the Waldmann group. Only their
third generation of PDE6D inhibitors, the Deltasonamides, can largely
withstand Arl2-mediated ejection, as they were highly optimized for
sub-nanomolar affinity. However, these compounds have a low partitioning
coefficient, suggesting low cell penetration.17 Unfortunately, this theme of micromolar cellular potency, despite
nanomolar affinity to the target in vitro, also continues with more
recent PDE6D inhibitors that emerged through substantial fragment-based
discovery and structure-based virtual screening efforts by the Xiong
and Sheng groups.18

In order to advance
PDE6D inhibitor development, it may therefore
be necessary to change the overall concept, as the discovery of various
chemotypes with high in vitro affinity has been well demonstrated.
We here present Deltaflexins, which have only micromolar in vitro,
yet also micromolar in cellulo potencies. We have overcome the approximately
1000-fold in vitro to in cellulo potency gap, by employing an innovative
compound engineering approach.

Results and Discussion
Generic Design of PDE6D Inhibitors with a Flexible Hexyl-Linker
and Cleavable Cell Penetration Group
In order to improve
the resilience of inhibitors against Arl2-mediated ejection from the
PDE6D prenyl-binding pocket, a flexible hexyl linker that was envisaged
to act like a buffering spring, was attached to a moiety that would
provide major contacts to the “top” of the pocket. The
design was completed by a simple phosphodiester “bottom”
moiety, which was protected with a previously developed cell penetration
group that was tunable for pharmacological stability.19,20 In our first-generation model compound, Deltaflexin-1 (15), the generic, heterocylic coumarin was chosen as “top”-moiety,
as it would allow for H-bonding and π-stacking (Figure 1A). In addition, a panel of
seven control compounds was synthesized that allowed us to assess
the contribution of each of the design elements (Figures 1A, S1A).

Figure 1 Newly designed inhibitors compete with K-Ras for PDE6D in vitro.

a generic heterocycle “top” was linked via a flexible

was measured. (C) Dose–response curve of Deltarasin and compounds 15 (Deltaflexin-1), 14 and 17 from

closed state (green, PDB code 1KSJ). Right shows details of PDE6D (open)
residues in proximity of docked Deltaflexin-1.

In order to validate the inhibitory activity of
the compounds on
the PDE6D/K-Ras interaction, we established a surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) assay. Farnesylated and carboxymethylated K-Ras (K-RasFMe) were
captured on the sensor chip surface via an avi-tag, and the binding
of PDE6D was measured (Kd PDE6D/avi-K-RasFMe
= 3.6 ± 0.1 μM) (Figure S1B, Table 1). Deltaflexin-1 (15) bound with a surprisingly good, low micromolar Kd that was only 2.6-fold higher than what we
determined for Deltarasin (Figure 1B,C, Table 1). This was encouraging given that this was the first generation
of compounds. Importantly, the control compound 17 with
a “stiff”, methyl cyclohexylmethyl linker had essentially
the same affinity to PDE6D as compound 15 and therefore
represented an excellent control for testing the significance of the
flexible hexyl linker later on in cells (Figure 1C, Table 1). The relatively hydrophobic 14, which
lacked the cell-penetration bottom-moiety exhibited a reduced binding
activity (Figure 1C, Table 1). Surprisingly, compound 19 the phosphorylated (charged) derivative of 14 showed an increase in the SPR response, suggesting stabilization
of the PDE6D/avi-K-RasFMe complex. Direct target binding data were
corroborated by a previously published fluorescence anisotropy (FA)
assay, which detects displacement of a fluorescently labeled, farnesylated
peptide derived from the PDE6D client Rheb (F-Rheb)14 (Figure S1C, Table S1).

Computational docking of Deltaflexin-1 into the PDE6D
crystal structure
suggested that similar to the Deltasonamide derivatives, the phosphotriester
bottom moiety of Deltaflexin-1 forms hydrogen bonds with Arg61 and
Gln78, at the base of the PDE6D pocket (Figures 1D, S1D,E).16,17 In addition, the top-moiety contacted Glu88, Ala112, and Met117.
Therefore, three out of the seven contacts that were also engaged
by the most optimized deltasonamide derivative (compound 8(17)) were utilized by Deltaflexin-1, consistent
with the overall similar positioning of the compound (Figure S1E). A comparison of Deltaflexin-1 docked
into PDE6D in the open and closed (Arl2-bound) state illustrates that
the potential steric clash between the protected phosphodiester at
the bottom of the pocket and Arg61 would likewise persist (Figure 1D). However, the
presence of the adjacent flexible hexyl linker may enable the protected
phosphodiester bottom moiety of Deltaflexin-1 to evade this clash.

Deltaflexin-1 Disrupts K-Ras/PDE6D Interaction and K-Ras Membrane
Organization in Cells
Next, we tested for on-target activity
in cells, using a FRET-assay, which directly detects the interaction
between K-RasG12V and PDE6D. Deltaflexin-1 significantly reduced the
FRET to a level comparable to that of Deltarasin (Figure 2A). This activity was also
seen with three derivatives that employed different chemical coupling
between top and linker moieties, suggesting a notable degree of flexibility
for compound synthesis (Figure S2A). By
contrast, the control compound, 17, with a “stiff”
methyl-cyclohexylmethyl linker moiety, lacked in cellulo activity
(Figure 2A), despite
identical in vitro activity (Table 1). Likewise, 14 and 19 without
the cell-penetration bottom-moiety did not block the interaction (Figure 2A). In support of
the middle moiety requiring a specific length, shortening of the methylen-linker
to four carbons abrogated the inhibitory activity in 20 (Figure 2A). Similar
results were obtained using the previously described FRET-pair of
PDE6D and another client, the farnesylated Ras-like GTPase Rheb (Figure S2B).11

PDE6D inhibition is expected to suppress K-Ras
localization and
activity more than H-Ras.13 We therefore
employed an additional cellular FRET-assay that detects FRET due to
nanoscale clustering (nanoclustering-FRET) of Ras oligomers, including
dimers, on the membrane.21 We previously
demonstrated that nanoclustering-FRET can quantify subcellular distribution
changes that may be difficult to establish by confocal imaging (Figure S2C).22,23 Thus, we confirmed
that FTI selectively affects H-Ras membrane anchorage more than that
of K-Ras, as the latter can be alternatively prenylated by geranylgeranyltransferase
I2,24 (Figure 2B,C). Given that rate-limiting steps of the PDE6D-mediated
trafficking cycle selectively facilitate plasma membrane anchorage
of K-Ras, but not H-Ras, knockdown of PDE6D selectively reduced the
K-Ras but not H-Ras nanoclustering-FRET (Figures 2B,C and S2D).
By contrast, the reference PDE6D-inhibitor, Deltarasin, reduced FRET
of both Ras isoforms about equally. This indicates pan-Ras-directed,
off-target effects of Deltarasin that may underlie its relatively
high general toxicity.16 Deltaflexin-1
on the other hand selectively reduced K-RasG12V but not H-RasG12V
FRET as expected (Figure 2B,C). This was confirmed with the three linkage derivatives,
further corroborating the flexibility at this position in our generic
design (Figure S2E,F). Importantly, Deltaflexin-1
demonstrated an in cellulo potency in this FRET-assay [IC50(15) = 1.65 ± 0.95 μM (mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM))] that was comparable to the in vitro affinity
(Kd = 3.61 ± 0.02 μM), although
it was not as potent as Deltarasin in cellulo [Figure 2D, IC50(Deltarasin) = 0.7 ±
0.4 μM (mean ± SEM)].

Previous work suggested that
the pharmacological stability of the
cell penetration group can be tuned within the esterase cleavable S-acyl moiety by the electronegativity of the 2-substituent,
such as ethoxycarbonyl (relatively labile) or methyl (more stable).20 Indeed, heating of Deltaflexin-1 before application
to cells decreased its cellular activity to a level similar to that
of 14 or 19, which both do not have the
cell penetration group (Figure S2G).

In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the hexyl-spring
and cell penetration group enable a similar in cellulo potency of
Deltaflexin-1 as observed in vitro. Importantly, Deltaflexin-1 acts
on-target in cells allowing for a selective inhibition of K-Ras activity,
whereas the reference compound Deltarasin affects equally K-Ras and
H-Ras.

Deltaflexin-1 Selectively Inhibits Oncogenic K-Ras Driven Cell
Proliferation and Tumorosphere Formation
In order to further
validate the K-Ras selectivity in cells, we examined the effect of
Deltaflexin-1 and derivatives on 2D proliferation of colorectal cancer
cell lines. Deltaflexin-1 inhibited the K-RasG13D mutated HCT116 (IC50 = 11 μM, CI 95% 8.1–16 μM) significantly
more than the Ras wt HT-29 cell line (IC50 = 40 μM,
CI 95% CI 25–72 μM, p < 0.0001) (Figure 3A,B). Similar micromolar
activities and oncogenic K-Ras selectivity (p <
0.0001) were also seen in the K-RasG13D-mutated and -dependent MDA-MB-231
(IC50 = 7.2 μM, CI 95% 5.1–9.7 μM) and
H-RasG12D-mutated and -dependent Hs 578T (IC50 = 21 μM,
CI 95% 13–35 μM) breast cancer cell lines (Figure S3A,B,G). Both activity and K-Ras selectivity
in colon and breast cancer cells were corroborated by Deltaflexin-1
linkage derivatives (Figure S3C–F).

Figure 3 Deltaflexin-1 selectively inhibits oncogenic K-Ras-driven cell
proliferation and mammosphere formation. (A,B) Dose-dependent cell

of MDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T spheroids at day 10 of suspension culture,
after indicated treatments as in (C,D). Scale bar of 200 μm
is representative for all images.

Thus, half-maximal inhibition of K-Ras-mutant cancer
cell viability
by Deltaflexin-1 occurred at approximately 7- to 11-fold higher concentrations
than in the cellular K-Ras nanoclustering-FRET assay, which also means
that the in vitro and cancer cell inhibitory activities were very
similar. By contrast, the difference between cellular inhibition and
in cellulo on-target activity of the bis-sulfonamide inhibitor Deltasonamide
2 was 12- to 25-fold, while an even greater difference is apparent
for this compound when compared to the in vitro affinity (650- to
1300-fold).17 It is plausible to assume
that the better in vitro/cell inhibition activity relation of Deltaflexin-1
compared to Deltasonamide 2 is due to its spring moiety.

While
these results demonstrate selectivity for cancer cells expressing
mutant K-Ras, the comparison of proliferation in 2D is not as discriminatory
as the nanoclustering-FRET assay. However, in the past, we established
that compounds which selectively decrease K-Ras-, but not H-Ras-nanoclustering-FRET,
have a high potential as inhibitors of stemness properties of cancer
cells, as measured by the formation of tumorospheres.22,25 Accordingly, the selective effect of PDE6D on K-Ras but not H-Ras
(Figure 2B,C) makes
PDE6D a good target to enable such anticancer stemness activity. Indeed,
tumorosphere formation of K-RasG12V, but not H-RasG12V transfected
or control HEK cells,26 was selectively
decreased after knockdown of PDE6D (Figure S3H–J). Similarly, mammospheres derived from K-Ras mutant MDA-MB-231 were
inhibited by Deltaflexin-1 more significantly than those of H-Ras
mutant Hs 578T (Figure 3C–F). Control compounds 17 and 20 with a stiff or shortened linker, respectively, had no significant
effect (Figure 3C,D).
This K-Ras-mutant mammosphere selectivity was largely confirmed with
the Deltaflexin-1 linkage derivatives (Figure S3K,L), nevertheless suggesting some off-target effects on
tumorosphere growth by the different linkages.

Second Generation Deltaflexins with Improved Chemotype
Encouraged by these results, a second generation of inhibitors was
developed based on Deltaflexin-1. We replaced the potentially toxic
coumarin moiety with a substituted terephthalic acid moiety, thus
generating a partial hybrid with a bis-sulfonamide Deltasonamide inhibitor
(compound 8(17)) (Figure 4A). In addition, the bottom
moiety was varied to characterize the activity of the pharmacologically
more stable 2-methyl-substituent on the S-acyl cell penetration group.
While compound 23 with the more stable bottom-moiety
had a comparable affinity to 15, its analogue 22 bound with a 2.6-fold lower affinity (Figure 4B, Table 1, Figure S4A, Table S1).

Figure 4 Partial scaffold hybridization creates
second-generation inhibitors.

Deltaflexin-1, and Deltaflexin-2 at concentrations ranging from 0
to 20 μM; n ≥ 3. Higher efficacy results
in a higher drug sensitivity score (DSS), an area under the curve
(AUC) metric. Graphs show mean values ± SEM. Statistical significance
levels are annotated as **p < 0.01; ****p < 0.0001; ns, not significant.

Computational docking supported these data, as
overall similar
positioning and similar contacts as for Deltaflexin-1 were observed
for the second-generation compounds in the PDE6D pocket (Figure S4B). It appeared though that the substitution
of the top moiety from an aromatic two-ring system to one aromatic
ring allowed for more flexibility of the top moiety orientation. Moreover,
the potential for a new hydrogen bond with Ser115 was identified for
both 22 and 23. In addition, the bending
of 23 could contribute to the formation of an additional
hydrogen bond with Glu88, which is not observed in 22 (Figure S4B). The relative strength of
these interactions may contribute to the observed differences in the
binding affinities.

In agreement with the in vitro data, second-generation
compound 23 performed as well as 15 and
somewhat better
than 22 in disrupting the K-RasG12V/PDE6D interaction
as assessed by FRET-experiments in cells (Figure 4C). Similarly, amongst the 4n-methylen-linker counterparts of 22 and 23, 25 performed better than 24 (Figure 4A,C). These data
further support that the replacement of the relatively labile 2-ethoxycarbonyl
with the more stable 2-methyl on the S-acyl cell penetration group
is beneficial. Finally, 22 and 23 (hereafter
named Deltaflexin-2) led to a significant dose-dependent reduction
of the K-RasG12V nanoclustering-FRET compared with 24 and 25 (Figure 4D). No effect on H-RasG12V FRET was observed (Figure S4C).

Recently, exquisite K-RasG12C
selectivity was demonstrated for
the covalent inhibitor ARS-1620.7 In agreement
with a significant overall activity, quantitative scoring of the chemical
inhibition of PDE6D with Deltaflexin-2 revealed that it had 70% activity
of ARS-1620 in KRAS-G12C mutant NCI-H358 lung cancer cells grown as
tumorospheres. Moreover, Deltaflexin-2 was inactive in the B-RafV600E
mutant A375 lung metastasis melanoma cell line, as was ARS-1620 (Figure 4E). These data confirm
that Deltaflexins significantly inhibit cell spheroid growth in a
K-Ras selective manner. By contrast, no such selectivity was found
for Deltarasin, which showed equally high activity in both cell lines,
again suggesting a general off-target toxicity.

Similarly, K-RasG13D-mutant
MDA-MB-231- but not H-RasG12V-mutant
Hs 578T-mammosphere formation was selectively decreased by Deltaflxin-2,
while the counterpart with the shorter flexible linker 25 was inactive (Figure S4D,E). In line
with the Ras-mutation status, the mammosphere formation of MDA-MB-231
and Hs 578T was selectively abrogated by the knockdown only of the
mutated Ras isoform (Figure S4F–I), confirming that this assay can report on the selectivity for oncogenic
K-Ras (MDA-MB-231) or H-Ras (Hs 578T). However, knockdown of PDE6D
strongly affected sphere formation of both cell lines (Figure S4F,G).

We therefore conclude that
Deltaflexins can block stemness traits
of cancer cells and have a clear in cellulo selectivity for K-Ras
as compared to H-Ras. However, our data also suggest that the stemness
inhibiting activity of PDE6D inhibitors depends at least in breast
cancer cell lines on other clients or activities of PDE6D.

In
this work, we have demonstrated that the attachment of a “chemical
spring” and cell penetration group to a generic heterocycle
enables the de novo design of low micromolar PDE6D inhibitors in the
first generation. This redesign approach is strikingly simple and
together with the flexible coupling chemistry should allow for improvements
of existing PDE6D inhibitors. As validated by the second-generation
compounds, our approach is compatible with compound-scaffold hybridization
of existing PDE6D compounds. Thus, we expect to quickly advance the
development of more potent derivatives in the near future. Moreover,
our strategy may apply to inhibitors of closely related targets, such
as UNC119,27 in addition to PDE6D inhibitors.

Past generations of PDE6D inhibitors underwent substantial structure-based
optimization to arrive at sub and low nanomolar in vitro activities,
but surprisingly they exhibited ∼1000-fold less antiproliferative
potential in cancer cells. Thus, the relation of Deltaflexin-2 in
vitro and in cellulo potencies is ∼60- to 180-times better
than that of Deltasonamide-2. Moreover, as compared to Deltarasin,
Deltaflexins demonstrated the expected selectivity for K-Ras over
H-Ras in cells. Therefore, the current Deltaflexins can serve as valuable
tool compounds to investigate the PDE6D associated anticancer mechanisms.
While we demonstrate the K-Ras selectivity of Deltaflexins, the comparison
of PDE6D- and KRAS-knockdown data suggests K-Ras-independent effects
of PDE6D inactivation on stemness traits of cancer cells. Other activities
of PDE6D or clients other than K-Ras could be important in this context.
For example, the PDE6D client INPP5E (inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase
E) localizes to the primary cilium in a PDE6D-dependent manner.28−30 In line with a potential contribution of INPP5E inhibition to the
antistemness effect, primary ciliogenesis and associated Hedgehog
signaling have recently been linked to epithelial–mesenchymal
transition and stemness promotion in triple negative breast cancer.31

Nonetheless, K-Ras overactivity appears
to be an important biomarker
for the efficacy of PDE6D inhibitors.32 In order to establish the exact therapeutic spectrum of the single-agents,
a broader panel of cancer cells should be tested with PDE6D inhibitors
in the future. Given that carboxymethylation of the prenylated C-termini
of small GTPase clients provides additional affinity, it is foreseeable
that concurrent inhibition of isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase,
by inhibitors such as cysmethynil, will be synergistic with PDE6D
inhibitors.12,32

While targeting of signaling
or trafficking hubs, such as PDE6D,
could intuitively lead to more side effects, this approach may in
the end be advantageous from the drug development point of view. Given
that different cancer types and subtypes have diverse sets of drivers,33,34 drugs that target a hub may affect several cancer drivers at once.
Such hub inhibitors may therefore
be more easily applicable to several types of cancer. This strategy
is, for example, pursued for inhibitors of Hsp90, which is a major
hub of kinases.35,36 Irrespective of their exact mechanism
of action, PDE6D inhibitors therefore remain attractive as potential
cancer drugs.

Methods
DNA Constructs and siRNA
Plasmids pmGFP/mCherry-H-RasG12V
and pmGFP/mCherry-K-RasG12V were previously described.22,23 Plasmids for mCit-Rheb and mCherry-PDE6D were previously described.11 The human gene-directed siRNAs were purchased
from Dharmacon as ON-TARGET plus SMART siRNA pools. The catalogue
numbers are as follows: scrambled siRNA (cat. no. D-001810-10-05),
human KRAS (cat. no. L-005069-00, lot 170710), human HRAS (cat. no.
L-004142-00, lot 160414), and human PDE6D (cat. no. L-004310-00).
Opti-MEM and transfection reagents Lipofectamine 3000 (cat. no. L3000001)
and RNAiMAX (cat. no. 13778030) were purchased from Thermo Fisher
Scientific. JetPrime (cat. no. 114-75) was obtained from Polyplus,
Illkrich-Graffenstaden, France. FuGENE HD (cat. no. E2311) was purchased
from Promega Biotech AB, Nacka, Sweden.

Cell Culture
HEK293 EBNA cells were kind gift of Prof.
Florian M Wurm, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland. MDA-MB-231, Hs 578T,
HCT116, HT-29, NCI-H358, and A-375 cell lines were obtained from ATCC.
HEK293 EBNA, Hs 578T, HCT116, and HT-29 cell lines were maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, cat. no.
D6171, Sigma-Aldrich, Helsinki, Finland), supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (cat. no. S1810, Biowest, Nuaille, France) and
2 mM l-glutamine (cat. no. G7513, Sigma-Aldrich). MDA-MB-231,
NCI-H358, and A375 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
medium (RPMI, cat. no. R5886, Sigma-Aldrich), containing 10% FBS and
2 mM l-glutamine. All cells were incubated at 37 °C,
with 5% CO2, in a humidified cell incubator. Cells were
subcultured twice a week.

Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy-FRET
HEK293
EBNA cells were seeded in 12-well plates onto sterile coverslips.
The next day, cells were transfected using FuGENE HD or jetPRIME transfection
reagent with a total of 800 ng of plasmids. For donor samples, cells
were transfected with mGFP or mCitrine-tagged plasmid. In FRET pairs,
donors and acceptors were transfected at a 1:3 ratio. Acceptors were
mCherry-tagged Ras plasmids in the nanoclustering-FRET experiments
for membrane organization studies. For interaction studies, pmGFP-K-RasG12V
and pmCherry-PDE6D, or pmCitrine-Rheb and pmCherry-PDE6D, were used
all at the same 1:3 ratios with a total of 800 ng plasmids being used
in each experiment. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated
with either 0.1% DMSO control or various concentrations of test compound
or Deltarasin (cat. no. 9001536, Cayman Chemical, Tallinn, Estonia),
or FTI-277 (cat. no. Sc-215058, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
USA) or FTI-2628 (cat. no. sc-221635, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for
24 h and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) before mounting with Mowiol
4-88 (cat. no. 81381, Sigma-Aldrich). The donor fluorescence lifetime
was measured using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss AXIO Observer
D1) with a fluorescence lifetime imaging attachment (Lambert Instruments,
Groningen, The Netherlands), as previously described in refs (37, 38). The fluorescence lifetime of at least 40
cells per treatment was measured in each experiment. The percentage
of the apparent FRET efficiency (Eapp)
was determined using the measured lifetimes of donor–acceptor
pairs (τDA) of samples and the average donor lifetime
(τD), based on the equation: Eapp= (1 – τDA/τD)
× 100%.

Tumorosphere Assays
Mammosphere formation assays were
performed in F-bottom 96-well suspension culture plates (cat. no.
655185, Cellstar, Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany). 1500 cells
per well were seeded in 50 μL DMEM or RPMI medium containing
1× B27 (cat. no. 17504044, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific),
25 ng/mL EGF (cat. no. E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), and 25 ng/mL FGF (cat.
no. RP-8628, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were cultured for 6
days and then treated with test compounds or DMSO control (0.1% v/v)
for additional 3 days. The cells were resupplemented with fresh growth
medium every 2 days. For knockdown experiments and for K-Ras and H-Ras
transfections, cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with
either 50 nM scrambled siRNA or siRNA targeting PDE6D KRAS or HRAS
or with mGFP-K-RasG12V or mGFP-H-RasG12V plasmids, using jetPRIME
transfection reagent or Lipofectamine 3000. On the next day, cells
were replated into 96-well plates for suspension cell culture. Mammosphere
formation was analyzed under an EVOS FL microscope (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and spheres exceeding 50 μm in diameter were counted.
The SFE was expressed as percentage normalized to vehicle-treated
control. In protein overexpression or knockdown experiments, SFE was
normalized to the empty vector or scrambled siRNA-transfected controls,
respectively.

Tumorospheres of lung cancer cells were generated
by seeding NCI-H358 or A-375 cells (1500 cells per well) as a suspension
culture in F-bottom 96-well suspension culture plates (cat. no. 655185,
Cellstar, Greiner Bio-One) in 50 μL RPMI medium supplemented
with 0.5% methylcellulose, 25 ng/mL EGF, 25 ng/mL FGF, 1× B-27
supplement, and 2 mM l-glutamine. Cells were initially grown
for 72 h and treated with freshly thawed compounds. After another
72 h of incubation, the cell viability was assessed using the alamarBlue
assay (cat. no. DAL1100, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A 10% final
volume of alamarBlue reagent was added to each well of the plate and
incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Then, the fluorescence intensity
was measured using a FLUOstar OPTIMA plate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany)
with an excitation wavelength of 560 ± 5 nm and emission wavelength
of 590 ± 5 nm. The obtained fluorescence intensity data were
normalized to DMSO control. To quantitatively profile the drug sensitivity
from the dose–response data, the DSS algorithm was employed.39 The DSS score was calculated according to the
formula  

The curve fitting parameters were used
to calculate the AUC relative
to the total area (TA) between the 10% threshold (DMSO at 0.1%) and
100% inhibition (benzethonium chloride at 100 μM). The integrated
response is divided by the logarithm of the top asymptote (log a).

2D Cell Viability Assay
Hs 578T, HCT-116, and HT29
cells were plated onto 96-well cell culture plates at a density of
500 cells/well and allowed to attach for 24 h. Freshly thawed aliquots
of test compounds were then added ice-cold at indicated concentrations.
DMSO (0.1% v/v) was used as control. Plates were further incubated
for 72 h. The cell viability was assessed using the alamarBlue reagent,
according to manufacturer’s instructions. The fluorescence
intensity was read with the excitation wavelength of 530 ± 10
nm and emission wavelength of 590 ± 10 nm using a Synergy H1
plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

Western Blotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (cat.
no. 89900, Thermo Scientific) containing protease (cat. no. 88666,
Thermo Scientific) and phosphatase inhibitors (cat. no. 0496845001,
Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and then sonicated for 5 min in ice-cold
water. Proteins were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyAcrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (cat. no. NBA 083C001EA, Protran, Waltham, USA) using a
Transferblot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Briefly,
the membranes were blocked in 1xTBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 5%
w/v nonfat dry milk for 30 min and incubated with primary antibodies
PDE6D (cat. no. sc-166854, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Paso Robles,
CA, USA.) or β-actin (cat. no. A1978, Sigma-Aldrich) overnight,
at 4 °C. The membranes were then incubated with secondary antibodies
antimouse (cat. no. sc-2954, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at
room temperature. Protein bands were detected using a ChemiDoc MP
instrument (Bio-Rad) after treatment with ECL reagent (cat. no. 170-5061,
BioRad). The protein-band intensities were measured using Image Lab
software (Bio-Rad).

RT-qPCR Analysis for Gene Knockdowns
MDA-MB-231 and
Hs 578T cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with 50
nM of siRNA KRAS or HRAS or scrambled, negative control siRNA (QIAGEN,
cat. no. 1022076, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) using Lipofectamine. After
24 h of transfection, total RNA was isolated using NucleoZol according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (cat. no.: 7040404, Macherey-Nagel,
Hoerdt, France). Reverse transcription was performed with 1 μg
of total RNA using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (cat. no.:
18080093, Invitrogen). The knockdowns of KRAS and HRAS gene transcripts
were analyzed by real-time qPCR using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad), on the CFX-connect real-time PCR instrument (Bio-Rad).
The transcripts were selectively amplified using specific primers
producing amplicons for KRAS (total) and HRAS. The gene β-actin
was used as reference. The following primers were used: for KRAS (total),
forward 5′-tacagtgcaatgagggacca-3′, reverse 5′-tcctgagcctgttttgtgtct-3′
(amplicon 206 bp); for HRAS, forward 5′-ctgaccatccagctgatcca-3′,
reverse 5′-tggcaaacacacacaggaag-3′ (amplicon 196 bp);
for ACTB (β-actin), forward 5′-ggggtgttgaaggtctcaaa-3’;
reverse 5′-ggcatcctcaccctgaagta-3′.40

Confocal Imaging
MDCK cells, stably overexpressing
mGFP-KRasG12V, were seeded onto coverslips in 12-well cell culture
plates. The cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO control or 5 μM
Deltarasin or Deltaflexin-1. After 24 h cells were fixed in 4% PFA
and mounted with Mowiol, cells were imaged using a laser scanning
microscope (LSM 780) Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany.

Compound Syntheses
Purchased compounds were used without
further purifications. Chemicals and solvents were purchased from
the companies Sigma-Aldrich, VWR, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. Solvents
were dried over 3 or 4 Å molecular sieves. Commercially available
solvents for semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) (acetonitrile HPLC grade) were used. Solvent mixtures are understood
as volume/volume. Extended information on the complete compound syntheses
and analytics are described in Supporting Information S1.

Molecular Modeling
Docking studies were carried out
by the GOLD module41 of Discovery Studio
4.5 (Accelrys Inc. San Diego, USA, http://www.accelrys.com/) using the crystal structure of PDE6D
determined at 1.45 Å resolution (PDB code 4JV8)15 as the receptor molecule. Water molecules and the bound
ligand were removed from the structure prior to the docking. Binding
sites were identified by using the binding site identification tool
in Discovery Studio. The binding site that matched also the binding
site identified by the crystal structure was selected for docking.
The ligands were generated with ChemDraw Professional 15.1 (PerkinElmer
Informatics, www.cambridgesoft.com) and exported as *.mol files to the Discovery Studio. Hydrogen atoms
were added to the protein and the ligand. The Goldscore fitness function
was used to score the poses.

SPR Binding and Inhibition Assays
SPR binding experiments
were performed on a Biacore S200 instrument (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,
Marlborough, MA, USA) as described previously.42 Farnesylated and methylated K-Ras-GDP (K-RasFMe), with
an N-terminal avi-tag, was captured on neutravidin-coupled CM5 sensor
chips (capture density 500–1500 RU). PDE6D (2-fold serial dilution,
20–0.039 μM) was injected over the K-RasFMe surface in
20 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.01%,
Tween 20, 5 mM MgCl2, and 5% DMSO at 30 μL/min and
with a contact time of 60 s. The inhibitory activity of compounds
for PDE6D/K-RasFMe interaction was measured using 1.25 μM PDE6D
and a serial dilution of compound (2-fold, 100–0.39 μM)
using the same buffer and flow rate. PDE6D (1.25 μM) was diluted
with Deltarasin (3-fold, 50 μM to 68 nM) was used as a positive
control. All titrations were run over three flow cells with variable
surface densities of K-RasFMe. The data were processed by subtracting
binding responses on the reference flow cells as well as the buffer
subtraction. The samples were also corrected for DMSO mismatches using
a DMSO standard curve. The equilibrium binding constant and IC50 values were calculated using the Biacore S200 Evaluation
software. The IC50 value obtained from SPR and FA assay
was converted into Kd using a modified
Cheng–Prusoff equation  where KD is the
dissociation constant between PDE6D/K-RasFMe and [L] is the concentration of PDE6D used in SPR experiments.44

FA Assay
The binding of compounds to PDE6D was assessed
in an FA assay using fluorescein-tagged farnesylated Rheb (F-Rheb)
peptide as the probe.14,43 PDE6D was produced as described
below. FA assays were performed on a black low volume, round-bottom,
non-binding surface 384-well plate (Corning, #4514) in an assay buffer
composed of 30 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 3 mM dithiothreitol. To a
three-fold dilution of compounds in assay buffer (300 μM to
1.7 nM), a complex of 0.25 μM F-Rheb peptide and 2 μM
PDE6D was added, and the reaction mix was incubated for 15 min at
RT. Then, the FP was recorded on a Synergy H1 hybrid plate reader
(BioTek) equipped with a polarization cube with an excitation wavelength
of 485 ± 10 nm and emission wavelength of 528 ± 10 nm. The
FP data were plotted against the logarithmic concentration of compounds
and fit to log inhibitor vs response–variable slope (four parameters)
equation in Prism (GraphPad), and the IC50 was determined.

Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Proteins
PDE6D was recombinantly produced in Escherichia
coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with pDest-His6-MBP-PDE6D
grown at 37 °C until OD of 0.6–0.8 and then induced with
0.5 mM of β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at
16 °C.12 The bacterial lysate was
prepared in a binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 300 mM NaCl, 5
mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride),
and protease inhibitor tablet from Roche) containing 0.5 mg/mL of
lysozyme. Soluble proteins were isolated after sonication and centrifugation
steps. The protein His6-MBP-TEV-PDE6D was purified on HisTrap HP column
(GE Healthcare) in binding buffer containing imidazole and eluted
with a 20 column-volume gradient from 35 to 500 mM imidazole. The
eluted fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing
His6-MBP-TEV-PDE6D were treated with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease
(cat. no.: T4455, Sigma-Aldrich) (1:25 w/w, TEV/fusion protein) for
1 h at room temperature and then dialyzed overnight in binding buffer
without protease inhibitor. The cleavage product containing His6-MBP
and PDE6D was loaded a second time on a HisTrap HP column in binding
buffer. The peak fractions (OD280) corresponding to the nonbound protein
PDE6D were collected, pooled, concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal
Filters (Merck Millipore, Molsheim, France), and analyzed on a SDS-PAGE
gel with Coomassie blue. The presence of purified PDE6D was confirmed
by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-PDE6D antibody (cat. no.:
sc-376724, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; dilution ratio 1:200).

The baculovirus expression vector for production of processed K-Ras4B
has been previously described.44 An avi-tagged
full-length K-Ras4B clone was generated by introducing an avi sequence
(LNDIFEAQKIEWG) between the TEV protease cleavage site (ENLYFQG) sequence
and amino acids 2–188 of K-Ras4B. The baculovirus expression
vector for the production of processed avi-K-Ras4B was produced using
the methods described previously.44 Expression
of farnesylated and carboxymethylated K-Ras4B (K-RasFMe) and avi-K-Ras-FMe
followed the methods as described.42 Purification
of processed avi-tagged full-length K-Ras4B was as described44 with modifications. Protein isolated after the
removal of the N-terminal His6-MBP tag (21.5 μM avi-K-Ras-FMe)
was biotinylated by incubating for 2 h at room temperature with 2.8
μM His6-BirA, 3.6 mM ATP, 215 μM biotin in a buffer of
20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP
(Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride), and 1:1000 v/v protease
inhibitor (P8849 Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction was then dialyzed at
4 °C for 16 h against 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM
MgCl2, and 1 mM TCEP. The dialyzed reaction was passed
over a HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with dialysis
buffer, to remove His6-BirA. The biotinylated avi-K-Ras-FMe has a
slight affinity for the column and elutes from the column at low (<50
mM) imidazole concentrations. Fractions were analyzed by coomassie-stained
SDS-PAGE, and positive fractions were pooled and dialyzed against
20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM
TCEP for 3 h at room temperature. The protein concentration was determined
by absorbance at 280 nm, and aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at −80 °C.

Statistical Analysis
GraphPad Prism software was used
for the statistical analysis. The sample size n for each data set
is provided in the relevant figure legends and represents independent
experiments. Unless otherwise stated, statistical significance was
evaluated with the Student’s t-test or One-way
ANOVA complemented by multiple comparison post hoc tests, as appropriate.
A p-value of <0.05 is considered statistically
significant, and the statistical significance levels are annotated
as * = p < 0.05; ** = p <
0.01; *** = p < 0.001; **** = p < 0.0001, or ns = not significant.
