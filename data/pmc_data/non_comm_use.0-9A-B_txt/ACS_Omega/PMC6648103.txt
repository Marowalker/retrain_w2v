We report accurate optical measurements
of tubulin polarizability
in aqueous suspensions. We determined the dependence of polarizability
on tubulin concentration and on the suspension’s pH, providing
benchmark numbers for quantifying the optical response of this protein
in various artificial and cellular environments. We compare our measurement
data with a few estimates found in the previous literature and also
with our simplified model estimations.

1 Introduction
The interactions between electromagnetic (EM) fields in the optical
regime and biological structures are important because they can lead
to a better understanding of both the optical properties of biological
matter (passive sensing) as well as the mechanisms involved to actively
influence biological processes using light. In order to quantitatively
describe this interaction, the optical response of the biological
structures involved must be known first. In this work, we aim at describing
the optical response of individual proteins in aqueous environments;
more specifically, we focus our attention on tubulin because of its
biological importance.

Tubulin is a globular cellular protein
that self-assembles from
α–β heterodimers to form cylindrical polymers termed
microtubules that are responsible for a variety of key roles in the
cell, including maintenance of cell shape, force generation required
to segregate chromosomes in cell division, and transport of macromolecular
cargo.

Whereas the biochemical properties such as tubulin’s
ligand
binding sites, microtubule polymerization dynamics, and post-translational
modifications are well researched, the optical properties of tubulin
and microtubules have recently gained interest because of the reported
large dipole moment ≈ 1740 D1 and
net negative charge of 47e2 that this protein heterodimer possesses. Besides the relevant roles
of tubulin in biological processes, these characteristics, which ultimately
determine the outcome of its interactions with optical fields, make
tubulin unusual among all proteins.

Microtubules and unpolymerized
tubulin dimers have recently been
computationally modeled to shed light on the mechanisms by which they
play electrically relevant roles, such as acting as targets of tumor-treating
electric fields,3 acting as cables for
ionic transport across the cell,4 and morphologically
responding to electrostatic changes in the cellular environment using
negatively charged C-termini tails.5 Experimentally,
microtubules have been shown to re-orient in the presence of externally
applied ac electric fields6 and increase
electrical conductance of the buffer solution containing them.7

2 Materials and Methods
The tubulin samples were prepared mainly by following the standard
protocol from Cytoskeleton, Inc., similarly to previous reports.8 Briefly, the sample is prepared with tubulin
powder (porcine brain, >99% pure, T240, Cytoskeleton, Inc.), 1
mM
GTP, and prefiltered BRB80 buffer (pore size 0.22 μM), which
contains 80 mM PIPES, 2 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM EGTA. Samples
with different tubulin concentrations were prepared in the range from
2.5 to 5 mg/mL.

Even though these systems have concentrations
below the critical
level (5 mg/mL), spontaneous polymerization can still occur.9 Unlike other studies, we implemented preventive
mechanisms in our preparation procedure to avoid protein aggregation.
Briefly, the tubulin buffer suspension was reconstituted in ice by
using a so-called cushion buffer solution containing glycerol and
colchicine. These steps are critical for preventing aggregation and
polymerization of tubulin dimers and creating cluster- and microtubule-free
suspensions of tubulin dimers, which could affect the interpretation
of the refractometric measurements. More details on the sample preparation
procedure and the errors associated with this process can be found
in Appendices A and B, respectively.

3 Tubulin Polarizability
The response of material systems,
especially biological, to EM
fields is quite complex. The specific manifestations of a material’s
reaction to an EM field can be described by different parameters such
as the refractive index (RI), permittivity, polarizability, or dipole
moment, depending upon the scale of the light–matter interaction.
For instance, the size of a tubulin dimer is about 2 orders of magnitude
smaller (4 nm × 5 nm × 8 nm) than the optical wavelength;
thus, it acts as a dipole when interacting with visible light. Microtubules,
on the other hand, are multidimer polymers with a well-defined cylindrical
geometry (with a 25 nm diameter) and can be significantly larger (up
to 100’s of μm) than the optical wavelength along one
dimension, namely, the MT axis.
Thus, the EM response of the two systems (polymerized and unpolymerized
tubulin ensemble) must be described differently.

Characterizing
the polarizability of a single tubulin dimer is
practically very difficult to achieve because it requires localizing
and performing measurements on a single dipole. Designing procedures
and noninvasive probes may be an extremely challenging task.10 Alternatively, one can examine a large collection
of dimers suspended in a solvent that can act as an optically homogeneous
medium. Tubulin’s optical properties are then inferred using
appropriate effective media descriptions. Because the measurement
constraints are significantly relaxed, this macroscopic approach is
usually the preferred solution. It is also worth pointing out that
this approach provides, in fact, only a measure of the average speed
of light through the medium and cannot account for possible specific
characteristics of the microscopic structures.

A variety of
EM mixing theories (EMTs), including Maxwell Garnett,11 Lorentz–Lorenz,12 Wiener,13 and Arago-Biot,14 have been proposed and used in different situations.
Some of them are based on more or less rigorous coupling of dipolar
responses, whereas the others are empirical. Essentially, all these
mixing rules are developed under the assumption of weak and local
electric fields, which practically requires a small volume fraction
of inclusions, low permittivity contrast between host and inclusions,
as well as spatially uncorrelated dipoles. In the limit of high dilution
and weak scattering, all EMTs predict essentially similar results.
The discrepancies appear when the models’ premises start to
be gradually infringed. In such situations, more sophisticated homogenization
approaches are necessary to account, for instance, for anisotropic
or structured inclusions, for spatially correlated arrangements of
scattering centers, and so forth.11 Nevertheless,
regardless of the model used for homogenization, the process of retrieving
the electric permittivity εd of the dipolar inclusions
requires knowing the effective permittivity εeff of
the composite medium, that of the host material, εs, and also the volume fraction f of dipoles in the
medium.

4 New Technique for Measuring RI: Optical Fiber-Based
Reflectometry
Here, we report on using a spatio-temporal
coherence-gated dynamic
light scattering (DLS) technique15 to determine
the effective polarizability of tubulin in suspension. The method,
schematically depicted in Figure 1, permits performing simultaneously an optical fiber-based
refractometric measurement and dynamic scattering examination of the
medium under test. In general, when a composite medium such as a suspension
of scattering centers is illuminated through a partially transmitting
interface, part of the illuminating field, Er, is backscattered at the interface because of inherent Fresnel
reflections. At the same time, a portion of the transmitted field, Es(t), that is usually time-dependent,
is scattered back through the interface. Here, this scattering is
weak, that is |Er|2 ≫
|Es|2, and the time averaged
detected intensity is ⟨I(t)⟩ ≈ |Er|2.
In these conditions, one can use differential measurements of reflectivity
to estimate an effective RI of the tubulin suspension and then safely
use the abovementioned EMTs to retrieve the polarizability of tubulin
dimers.

Figure 1 Schematic of the spatio-temporal coherence-gated DLS. A fiber-based
common-path multimode interferometer allows performing simultaneously
optical fiber-based refractometric measurements and sensing dynamic
scattering. Light from a super-luminescent diode (SLD) is launched
to and collected from the sample through multimode fibers (MMFs) and
measured with a photodetector (PD). The bottom panels indicate the
time-fluctuating signal measured at the detector, I(t), which results from the interference between Er and Es(t), both in the time- and frequency-domain, P(f). In weak scattering conditions, the picoliter-sized
coherence volume (CV) at the distal end of the fiber probe, which
is determined by the size of the core of the MMF and the coherence
length (lc) of the broadband light source,
can be interpreted as a medium with effective optical properties,
εeff, as indicated in the inset. The time-averaged
total intensity detected, ⟨I(t)⟩, can be used to retrieve information on the effective reflectivity
of the fiber−medium interface, ⟨I(t)⟩ ∝ |r|2, and,
therefore, on the effective polarizability of the suspended protein,
α̅. The simultaneous measurement of dynamic scattering
ensures that the information retrieval is properly framed within effective
medium theories.

At the same time, the
system records the interference between Er and Es(t) originating
within a volume determined by the temporal
coherence of the radiation used. Effectively, this interference originates
in a picoliter-sized volume determined by the core size of the optical
fiber and the spectral properties of the light source. The heterodyne
amplification of Es(t), permits a direct and quantitative assessment of the scattering
contributions and therefore provides means for validating and correcting
the effective medium description usually invoked in these situations.
In the presence of scattering, the effective medium depiction should
comprise a complex RI.16

In our experiments,
light from the low-coherence source, an SLD
of 7 nm bandwidth centered at 670 nm (Superlum BLM-S-670-G-I-4; coherence
length of about 30 μm in aqueous media) was launched in a multimode
fiber (62.5 μm core) and then coupled to a 50/50 multimode coupler.
It is important to note that the choice of wavelength is irrelevant
for our methodology. Our choice of wavelength is simply to diminish
as much as possible any thermal influences generated by absorption.
In fact, our technique was specifically designed to operate in biologically
relevant environments where one would prefer to operate far from vis/NIR
absorption bands for water or UV for biological structures.

5 Tubulin Measurements
Panel (a) in Figure 2 shows the raw measurement
of reflectivity in the form of the time-averaged
voltage measured by the photo-receiver (New Focus 2001-FC) as a function
of tubulin concentration. Given the RI n1 of the optical fiber and that of the solvent alone, n2, one can calculate the Δn2 necessary to produce a change ΔR in
the measured reflectivity. The calculation uses the change in the
normal incidence Fresnel reflection coefficient , where  is the baseline reflectivity measured from
the solvent alone. Once Δn2 is found,
a first estimate for the value of the effective RI of the composite
can be evaluated simply as neff(0) = n2 + Δn2, as shown in panel
(c).

Figure 2 (a) Reflectivity measured as the time-averaged signal recorded
by the PD. (b) Averaged power spectra of the light intensity fluctuations
recorded for different tubulin concentrations, as indicated. The inset
shows the total scattered power β. (c) Effective RI of the tubulin
suspension inferred from measured reflectivity in (a). (d) Glycerol-correction
to the RI of tubulin suspension in (c); this must be subtracted before
using EMTs to retrieve the polarizability of individual tubulin dimers.

Estimating the tubulin polarizability
from this effective RI must
account for contributions from all the components: BRB80 + glycerol,
tubulin, and colchicine. Because of the small amount used, the influence
of colchicine is negligible. Figure 2d shows the actual contribution of glycerol to the
change in RI measured for the tubulin suspensions.17 The effective RI of the BRB80–tubulin system can
then be calculated as neff = neff(0) –
Δngly. Because of the linearity
of the effective RI in aqueous solutions of glycerol, a similar result
can be obtained by using a multiphase mixture model (BRB80–glycerol–tubulin).11

Along with the average reflectivity, we
also recorded the power
spectra of the intensity fluctuations of the light scattered from
the tubulin suspensions (Figure 2b). The power spectra P(f) were recorded in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 10 kHz with 1
Hz resolution and an integration time of 30 s over a total duration
of 5 min (10 spectra per measurement). The total scattering power
slightly increases with tubulin concentration but remains close to
that of the buffer alone at all times (inset of Figure 2b).

The small differences can be due
to residual aggregates, which
were found to be negligible from independent DLS measurements performed
with a commercial equipment (Malvern Zetasizer; see Appendix B). Overall, these measurements verify that our results
can be framed within an effective medium interpretation.

The
variability in the measurements of reflected power is smaller
than 5 mV at all times. This corresponds to an instrumental precision
of about 5 × 10–4 for our RI measurement (see Appendix C for details). From this experiment,
the refractive index increment (slope of neff vs concentration) obtained is . The effective RI of tubulin suspensions
measured for different concentrations can now be used in an appropriate
EMT to retrieve the average polarizability of tubulin dimers. Here,
we used the Maxwell Garnett mixing model; more details on the applicability
of different mixing rules can be found in Appendix B. The effective permittivity of the suspensions was estimated
by assuming a baseline RI of the solvent of 1.3386, which is equal
to that of water at a temperature of 21 °C and for a wavelength
of 670 nm.18 This retrieves a permittivity
of the tubulin dimers of εtub = 3.5251 ± 0.861
(ntub = 1.8765 ± 0.227), where the
standard deviation was obtained from the raw values of εtub retrieved across the different suspensions. The relatively
large error is inherent to the EMTs in the dilute limit used here
(see Appendix B). This value of εtub as well as the slope in the concentration experiment  are comparable
to those obtained from experiments
performed with commercial refractometers not only on the same protein,8 but also on many other molecular species.19

By using the standard Clausius–Mossotti
formulation,11, the average polarizability of
the tubulin
dimers can be estimated by using the effective permittivity measured,
εeff, and the number density of dipoles, n = NAC, where NA is Avogadro’s number and C is the concentration in mol/m3. For the concentration
range explored here, and using the molecular weight of a tubulin dimer
(110 kDa), this results in an average permittivity α̅
in the range from 3.30 to 9.10 × 10–34 cm2 V–1, at a wavelength of 670 nm and in aqueous
media.

6 Effect of pH on Tubulin Polarizability
In a first stage of our experiments, the pH of the tubulin suspension
was adjusted in the range from 7 to 7.5. The pH of a baseline sample
(tubulin 33.75 μM, pH 7) was increased by progressively adding
drops of an aqueous solution of KOH (1 μM; 5 μL/drop).
Similarly, in a second stage, the pH was decreased to 6.5 starting
from a similar baseline sample by progressively adding drops of an
aqueous solution of HCl (1 μM; 5 μL/drop). For reference,
the same procedures were applied to the buffer solutions (solutions
of BRB80 alone); the pH was varied in the same range. In all cases,
the initial sample volume was 250 μL. At the final condition
of dilution, the concentration of tubulin is 18.0 μM. BRB80
remains a stable buffer within the range of our experiments.20 For the case of the buffers, we did not observe
a significant change, or a monotonic trend, with increasing concentration
of salt or acid; the reflectivity was practically constant in the
range of pH explored (less than 0.1% variability for both salt and
acid).

The fluctuation spectra were verified at all times during
our experiments;
no changes with the pH levels were detected. Similarly to the previous
experiment, the effective RI of the suspension was first corrected
for the amount of glycerol present at each point before using the
EMTs. Figure 3 shows
the RI of tubulin retrieved as a function of pH. The value reported
by Krivosudský et al.,8 which was
re-calculated here for an aqueous solvent, and using the same protein
density and concentration as in our case, is plotted for reference.

Figure 3 Effective
permittivity, εtub (right axis), and
average polarizability, α̅tub (left axis),
of tubulin dimers in suspension as a function of the environmental
pH. The red cross indicates the value reported in ref (8), after being re-calculated
for an aqueous solvent, and using the same protein density and concentration
as is our case.

The strong dependence
of the response of tubulin to the environment
is in accordance to that observed at lower frequencies.6a

7 Discussion
A quantitative
estimation of the tubulin polarizability at optical
wavelengths and the influence of its structural composition is a challenging
task. Even modeling the effect of a static electric field must account
for various contributions from the stretch of permanent dipole moments,
displacements of mobile positive and negative charges, displacement
of counter ions at C-terminals, and the organization of water molecules
within the solvation shell. Nevertheless, we simulated the structure
of tubulin21 at different pH levels and
then computed the permanent dipole moment at protonation states across
a pH range between 6.5 and 7.5. Details of the modeling procedure
are included in Appendix D and the results
are summarized in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Computed magnitude of the molecular dipole moment (left axis) and
the net charge (right axis) of the tubulin monomer as a function of
the pH.

As can be seen, the evaluated
variation of the dipole moment has
a trend similar to the functional dependence seen experimentally.
This indicates that there is a correlation between the effects of
pH-dependent protonation that affects the net charge and dipole moments
of tubulin on its dynamic response to the external EM fields, as can
be expected.

Also shown in Figure 4 is the fact that the net charge increases
significantly across the
pH range examined. Note that, for tubulin, about 40% of this charge
is associated with the C-termini.22 This
observation together with the fact that a higher pH value leads to
increase of the effective protein size could allow one to consider
the tubulin monomer as a charged nanosized particle with a varying
surface potential and placed in an oscillatory field.23 At a higher pH, the excess charge is practically distributed
across an effectively larger area, leading to a decay of the dielectric
function and the corresponding monomer polarizability. A quantitative
assessment of the permittivity at the experimental frequency of 440
THz should involve a detailed description of the surface conductivity24 and will be the focus of a separate communication.

To put our present results in perspective, we should discuss them
in the context of available literature reports, namely those from
Mershin et al.1a,25 and Krivosudský et al.8 In Mershin,1a,25 the reported
RI value for tubulin is ntub = 2.9, which
is obtained in two independent measurements of refractometry and surface
plasmon resonance. More recently, the refractometric measurements
performed by Krivosudský8 indicate
a value around ntub = 1.6, which is somewhat
closer to the values retrieved in our experiments. The actual effects
causing the retrieval of high values of the measured RI in earlier
experimental works1a,25,26 are unclear. However, we found a number of reasons for the rather
large discrepancies that range from sample preparation to data analysis
and interpretation.

When operating around the critical concentration
for protein polymerization
(5 mg/mL in the case of tubulin), considerable care should be exerted
for the sample preparation. In the experiments reported in refs (1a and 25), the concentration of tubulin goes as high as 8 mg/mL, whereas in
ref (8) it is kept
below the critical value at all times. However, neither of those works
involved corrective measures to avoid the spontaneous polymerization
of tubulin, which is prone to occur, even at room temperature.9 A related issue is the purity of the tubulin
samples themselves, which may influence the presence of tubulin aggregates.
A detailed description of our procedure and the systematic measures
to prevent aggregation are included in Appendix A.

Regarding the data processing, we note that the correct
formulation
of the EMTs is in terms of volume fractions of the components. However,
to avoid using the mass density of tubulin dimers, the previous works
conducted their analysis in terms of mass fractions. An approximately
density-matched condition is assumed based on the reported density
of ρsol = 1.4 mg/mL for the solvent, which is rather
high for an aqueous solution. In fact, we measured this density to
be ρsol = 1.0085 mg/mL for similar solvents. Moreover,
using the molecular weight and the approximate volume of a monomer,
we estimated the mass density of tubulin to be ρtub = 2.08 g/mL, which is about twice larger than ρsol. Consequently, in this type of measurements the retrieval of tubulin
polarizability must involve the rigorous formulation of the EMTs in
terms of volume fractions. Further details can be found in Appendix B.

We also noticed that the RI
increment expected for a large number
of protein species is around  = 1.9 × 10−4 (mg/mL)−1.19 Although there are
reports on species with dn/dC larger
than that, the value of dn/dC remains
very far from the value used in refs (1a and 25), which
is one order of magnitude off.

Lastly, we would like to stress
that the dielectric properties
of various components can be estimated using such mixing rules only
if the suspension is optically homogeneous. Scattering of light outside
the measurement volume represents a loss that is not accounted for
in conventional EMTs. Nevertheless, this approach has been used indiscriminately
in the previous literature reports to interpret measurements on suspensions
of both tubulin and microtubules.1a,8 Surprisingly,
the latter papers report similar RI values for both tubulin dimers
and for much larger MT structures. In the current experiments, we
ensured a minimal and constant level of scattering by continuously
monitoring the strength of the dynamic scattering. The measurement
of an effective polarizability of MT constructs will be the subject
of a separate report.

8 Biological Relevance
Cancer cells have been shown to have higher intracellular pH and
lower extracellular pH opposed to healthy cells.27 More specifically, despite the large diversity of diseases
that cancer comprises, cancer cells share common features such as
a typical “reversed” pH gradient with a constitutively
increased intracellular pH that is higher than the extracellular pH,
which makes them more acidic.28 The pH
changes in cancer cells alter the metabolic rates and aid in cell
proliferation, thus promoting cancer progression.27b,29 For microtubules specifically, an alkaline pH leads to disassembly
and reduces the critical concentration required for nucleation.30 Additionally, microtubule interactions with
taxol weaken in the presence of alkaline pH,31 and the net charge on the tubulin dimer increases.6a Computational models also show that as the pH increases,
the C-termini tails extend outwards.5b,32 Here, we show
that at higher pH, the RI of tubulin dimers decreases, which can provide
a measure of the physical state of the tubulin dimer.

Whereas
cell growth is well-known to be attenuated by the pH of
the growth culture, the pH inside a cell itself has been hypothesized
to act as a “clock for mitosis”,33 with the maximum pH being observed as mitosis initiates,
and falling as it progresses. Our findings show that as mitosis progresses,
the RI of tubulin increases. Therefore, measurements of subtle variations
of tubulin’s RI can be used as a proxy for probing the dynamical
state of the cell. With the methodology presented in this paper, new
avenues can be opened for probing internal cell dynamics via optical
properties of one of the most important and abundant proteins in eukaryotic
cells, tubulin.
