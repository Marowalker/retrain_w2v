Fentanyl
and its derivatives have become pervasive contaminants
in the U.S. heroin supply. Previously, we reported a proof-of-concept
vaccine designed to combat against heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
Herein, we optimized the admixture vaccine and found that it surpassed
the individual vaccines in every antinociceptive test, including a
10% fentanyl to heroin formulation. It is anticipated that other co-occurring
drug abuse disorders may also be examined with admixture vaccines.

Introduction
The opioid use disorder
is a significant public health concern.
Although the number of opioid users in the U.S. has remained relatively
constant over the past decade, there have been a mounting number of
opioid overdose deaths, and as a result, a public health emergency
was declared in 2017.1,2 Heroin is a schedule I, highly
addictive opioid drug, which has garnered much attention recently
because of the growing trend in drug poisoning deaths, which increased
by 248% from 2011 to 2014.3 The increase
in heroin overdose deaths has been attributed to unintentional intoxication
involving synthetically manufactured drugs such as fentanyl and carfentanil.
Illicit fentanyl usage is becoming an emerging threat most likely
because of its inexpensive cost of production and greater potency
than other opioids, including heroin and oxycodone. In utilizing fentanyl,
a dealer may deliver the same drug payload for a fraction of the cost
of heroin. The extreme potency of fentanyl gives rise to the issue
of proper dosing, wherein a few milligrams can differentiate between
the user experiencing euphoria or lethal intoxication. Since 2013,
overdose deaths from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have increased
6-fold, outstripping those from every other drug.3 Of increasing concern, fentanyl is now appearing as a common
contaminant in other illicit drugs because of its potency and becoming
one of the most prominent killers linked to the drug crisis of the
nation.4,5

Hypoxia resulting from respiratory
depression is the primary cause
of lethality in opioid-induced overdose cases, most often involving
intravenous (iv) heroin use. In a recent study examining the extracellular
oxygen levels in the brains of rats receiving heroin laced with 10%
fentanyl, brain hypoxia was greatly enhanced when compared to heroin
or fentanyl alone.6 This finding suggests
that the accidental exposure to fentanyl, even in the presence of
heroin as a minor contaminant, puts the users at a significant risk
for overdose and further severe health complications.6 Naloxone is the principal treatment for opioid overdose
reversal, whereas buprenorphine and methadone are the traditional
medications for addiction recovery. Although naloxone has proven indispensable
in the wake of the developing opioid epidemic, the traditional pharmacotherapy
suffers from several drawbacks such as a short half-life and undesirable
side effects such as dysphoria.7 Current
long-term addiction therapies also suffer from limitations including
side effects and accessibility issues, as well as incidents of relapse
occurring for about 33% of patients.8,9

We and
other research groups have previously reported several examples
of immunopharmacotherapy as an innovative treatment strategy for addiction.
The concept behind immunopharmacotherapy is that it provides immunoantagonistic
protection from the drug without binding to the drug receptors in
the central nervous system (CNS).10−19 Moreover, antidrug vaccines produce a long-lasting guard against
the target drug without many of the side effects associated with traditional
pharmacological therapies. Individual conjugate vaccines of heroin13,16,20−22 and fentanyl11 have been previously disclosed. Yet, admixture
haptenic vaccines are uncommon. There is one report of an admixture
vaccine examining the structurally congruent opioids, morphine and
oxycodone immunoconjugates,15 and our own
disclosure of a heroin–fentanyl vaccine.23 Importantly, in our previous proof-of-concept study, our
admixture vaccine exhibited a similar level of efficacy when compared
to each individual conjugate vaccine. Herein, we detail an improved
admixture immunization strategy through an increasing hapten copy
number and employing a superior carrier protein, tetanus toxoid (TT),
and then combining two individual immunoconjugate vaccines to target
heroin and fentanyl (Figure 1).

and heroin are highlighted in blue and yellow, respectively, with

Results and Discussion
Extending
our immunopharmacotherapy approach from heroin to the
fentanyl class of drugs was a necessary transition in our vaccine
work considering the increase of opioid overdose from synthetic adulterants,
which is contributing to the rise in drug deaths across the U.S. As
the frequency of fentanyl contamination appearing in heroin and other
drug samples continues to grow at alarming rates, we were greatly
interested in improving upon our proof-of-concept admixture vaccine
(Figure 1).

The
amount of immunogenic carrier protein (T-cell epitope, 100
μg) used in each vaccine was kept constant to stimulate an equivalent
adaptive immune response (Table 1). However, because of the prohibitive cost of TT ($500/mg)
compared to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH, $2.27/mg), we opted to
use 100 μg of KLH in the control group as a representative of
immunogenic carrier protein rather than TT itself. In our previous
report, the individual vaccine groups received 50 μg of the
immunoconjugate, whereas the admixture group received 25 μg
of each immunoconjugate.23 For this study,
we utilized TT, a superior carrier protein to KLH,24 and altered conjugation parameters to increase the copy
numbers of the immunoconjugates from 11.3 for Fent and 7.3 for Her
to 23.4 and 12.4, respectively.23 In addition,
we doubled the number of rodents in the individual vaccine groups
and increased the number of animals in the control and admixture groups
by 33% from the previous study. Finally, mice were vaccinated subcutaneously
according to the schedule given in Table 1.

The sera collected
from mice at weeks 3 and 5 were analyzed against
both Her-BSA and Fent-BSA to determine the level of anti-heroin or
anti-fentanyl IgG antibodies produced by each vaccine group (Table 2). Accordingly, each
individual serum sample was examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), while midpoint titer was averaged per vaccination group
and coating antigen for each bleed time point. Although, the Fent
vaccination group had modest titers at week 3, the polyclonal antibody
response improved over time with subsequent boosts. Both individual
vaccines were within the same midpoint titer range by week 5. Moreover,
the admixture vaccination group elicited the highest level of response
at week 5.

test when comparing vaccinated groups to controls. ***P ≤ 0.001; *P < 0.05; ‡‡‡P ≤ 0.001 vs control.

The ELISA data were analyzed using a one-way analysis
of variance
(ANOVA) with a Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (Table 2). At week 3, [F(3,55) = 25.07, P < 0.0001], the admixture
was significantly different when compared to the control when Her-BSA
was used as the coating antigen. Both the Fent-TT and the admixture
vaccines were significant compared to the control when Fent-BSA was
used as the coating antigen at week 3 [F(3,55) =
40.36, P < 0.0001]. At week 5, the same trends
were observed for Her-BSA [F(5,53) = 24.49, P < 0.0001] and Fent-BSA [F(3,54) =
22.08, P < 0.0001]. In agreement with the ELISA
data, the affinity for the drug improves with subsequent vaccination
boosts (Table 2). The
IC50 values were obtained by pooling the individual sera
from each vaccine group, and all groups were analyzed by a competitive
binding assay using surface plasmon resonance (SPR).

After determining
the relative midpoint titer and affinity for
each vaccine group, we were interested in the efficacy of the Fent
and admixture vaccines in protecting against additional analogues
of fentanyl that may also appear as adulterants (Figure 2). Eight analogues of fentanyl
were tested against antibodies from week 5 sera. Four of the eight
analogues bind as competitively or better than fentanyl (derivatives
C, D, E, and G, respectively, Figure 2). Carfentanil and 3-methylfentanyl exhibit sub-micromolar
affinity (derivative J and F, respectively), whereas alfentanil and
remifentanil are not well recognized by the antibodies (derivatives
H and I, respectively, Figure 2). Interestingly, although 3-methylfentanyl and α-methylfentanyl
are regioisomers with small methyl substitutions (derivatives F and
G, respectively, Figure 2), a simple methyl functionalization at the C3-position of the piperidine
ring imparts a greater perturbation to antibody recognition than the
methyl substitution alpha to the piperidine nitrogen.

with respective 95% confidence intervals given in nanomolar are reported

Following thorough characterization
of each vaccine, we then tested
their efficacy in vivo. Hot plate and tail flick
nociception is mediated in the CNS and provides a relevant behavioral
model of the ability of the vaccine to reduce drug access to brain
and its subsequent effects; therefore, it was used as a substitute
for drug reward in the current study. For these behavioral models,
we employed heroin, fentanyl, and a 10% fentanyl to heroin antinociception
assay to test the vaccine efficacy against all the three drug scenarios.
Although “street heroin” has variable amounts of fentanyl
contamination, it would be impractical to test every possible variation.
Therefore, we selected 10% fentanyl to heroin as a representative
adulterant ratio for several reasons: (1) the first and most notorious
brand of “street heroin” known as “Tango and
Cash” was found to contain approximately 12% fentanyl, which
was thought to be responsible for approximately 126 overdose deaths.25 (2) Investigators in Melbourne, Australia, recently
analyzed the postmortem blood samples of victims who overdosed fentanyl-laced
heroin. Importantly, a range of blood ratios of fentanyl to morphine
from 1.25 to 19% with an average ratio of 10.21% were found.26 (3) As previously discussed, vide supra, investigators
who studied the markers of respiratory depression used a mixture of
heroin contaminated with 10% fentanyl (iv) in rats and found that
brain hypoxia was potentiated by the mixture compared to pure heroin
or fentanyl.6 On the basis of these findings,
it was deemed that a 10% fentanyl to heroin contamination would be
an adequate grounding for our behavioral antinociception studies.

In order to carry out such an experiment, we kept the fentanyl
dosing range constant and modified the heroin doses to be 10-fold
larger than the fentanyl dose. Organization and testing of each vaccination
group are described in Table 1, with six mice per group per drug scenario. The positive
control groups Her and Fent were run using only their respective drug
tests and the combination to minimize the number of animals used during
testing. The dose at which half of the animals in a group experience
the full antinociceptive effect of the drug [100% maximum possible
effect (MPE)] is defined as the ED50 value. The potency
ratios were calculated by normalizing the vaccine-shifted ED50 value compared to the control (KLH-vaccinated) values in each antinociceptive
test (Figure 3).

and a combination of drug (ip) in mice. The inset panel describes
each vaccination group. (A) Results from hot plate and tail flick

The dashed lines in the potency panels denote the control levels.

Results are shown in Figure 3 for each test with
the ED50 values reported on
the top and the potency ratios on the bottom, whereas the individual
dose–response curves are provided in the Supporting Information (Figures S7–S9). Thus, when
heroin was administered in the antinociception assay, both the Her
and the Her + Fent admixture vaccines significantly protected the
mice compared to controls based on a one-way ANOVA [F(2,14) = 26.01, P < 0.0001, hot plate; F(2,14) = 36.99, P < 0.0001, tail-flick];
however, the Her group was only significantly different from the control
group in the hot plate assay. With fentanyl administration, Fent and
Her + Fent admixture also blunted drug effects compared to control
mice vaccinated with KLH, cytosine–phosphodiester–guanine
(CpG) ODN, and alum [one-way ANOVA, F(2,15) = 9.986, P = 0.0017, hot plate; F(2,15) = 25.10, P < 0.0001, tail flick]. In the combined drug antinociceptive
test, only the Her + Fent admixture vaccines were efficacious against
the combination in both assays according to a one-way ANOVA [F(3,20) = 7.787, P = 0.0012, hot plate; F(3,20) = 5.881, P = 0.0048, tail flick].

The Her vaccine group presented a greater significance in the hot
plate assay compared to the fentanyl vaccine (Figure 3). Moreover, the dosing of fentanyl was kept
the same (0.05 mg/kg), whereas the initial dose of heroin was reduced
from 2 to 0.5 mg/kg. Indeed, this stepwise incremental order is consistently
observed in both assays when using the 10% antinociception dosing,
with the least efficacious group being control, followed by Fent,
Her, and the most effective being Her + Fent. In all tests, the admixture
performed appreciably better than individual vaccines and significantly
better in both antinociception tests, indicating a superior performance
of the admixture vaccine.

A caveat to our admixture antinociception
testing was being restricted
to intraperitoneal (ip) drug administration versus iv, the latter
of which would undoubtedly better mirror the real-life scenarios.
However, this constraint was unavoidable as in a murine model, the
maximal doses are limited to 200 μL through iv administration.
In addition, cumulative dosing is not an option for either route of
iv administration (retro-orbital sinus or tail vein). By contrast,
ip administration allows for 0.8 mL to 3.2 mL of heroin/fentanyl solution
to be dispensed, which enables both cumulative dosing and more accurate
administration of concentrations (5 mL/kg).

A second provision
to our admixture vaccine testing was that the
individual vaccines were constructed with 50 μg of unconjugated
TT. Although adding the unconjugated TT to individual vaccines was
meant to control for the total T-cell epitope within each vaccine
group, the unconjugated TT, a potent microbial antigen, may have created
unwanted competition between the antibody response for antidrug and
anti-TT antibodies, overall reducing the amount of antidrug neutralizing
antibodies. In fact, this suspicion corroborated with the ELISA data
(Table 2), which show
substantially lower titers when compared to the admixture, despite
employing the same amount of the immunoconjugate. The titers suggest
that the antibodies were competitively raised against the 50 μg
of “blank” TT.

To further delve into these findings,
an ELISA was run against
blank TT as a coating antigen to measure the polyclonal antibody response
to the carrier protein in each vaccination group for both bleed time
points (Supporting Information, Figure
S10). In alignment with our hypothesis, titers from week 3 show that
the individual vaccines elicit higher anti-TT titers than the admixture
vaccine compared to control [one-way ANOVA, F(3,54)
= 5.483, P = 0.0023, Supporting Information, Figure S10, week 3]. However, by week 5, there
was no significant difference found between any of the individual
and admixture vaccines [one-way ANOVA, F(3,54) =
7.645, P = 0.0002, Supporting Information, Figure S10, week 5]. As expected, control mice
did not produce detectible anti-TT titers at either bleed time point.
In sum, we posit that excess unconjugated TT provides unwanted TT
immunogenicity early on; yet, this is ultimately subdued because of
tolerance upon continued boosting.

The first measure to improve
the efficacy of our admixture vaccine
was implementation of the superior carrier protein, TT, over KLH.
Our lab has repeatedly demonstrated that the use of TT as a carrier
protein provides improved efficacy over other carrier proteins for
several of our vaccines against drugs of abuse including nicotine,
cocaine, and oxycodone.14,27,28 Increasing hapten densities on TT has been proven to empirically
increase the efficacy in heroin vaccines; however, this trend was
not observed for the carrier protein KLH.17 Therefore, maximizing the hapten conjugation for both Her and Fent
was the second measure to improve upon our initial proof-of-concept
admixture vaccine. Our rationale for lower copy numbers in the proof-of-concept
vaccine study was to have comparable copy numbers for Fent-KLH and
Her-KLH, so conjugation time and copy number were carefully monitored
and controlled.23 By allowing the haptens
to conjugate with carrier protein for an extended period of time (20
h), the hapten density was increased 1.7-fold and 2-fold for Her and
Fent immunoconjugates, respectively. Both carrier protein and hapten
density modifications drastically improved the performance of the
admixture vaccine compared to their individual component vaccines.

To summarize, an admixture vaccine was assembled to combat what
has become to be known as “street heroin,” heroin adulterated
with the potent synthetic opioid fentanyl. On the basis of our preliminary
findings, an opioid vaccine cocktail containing structurally incongruent
immunoconjugates can be readily applied to target two different drug
species. The admixture vaccine appeared to sequester both drugs and
performed exceptionally well in antinociception animal models in comparison
to our individual drug vaccines. Future plans will be to expand this
combination strategy to additional nonopioid drugs, such as cocaine.4 Indeed, individuals with co-occurring cocaine
and opioid use disorders have more severe drug use and poorer substance
use treatment outcomes compared with individuals with either substance
user disorder. Lastly, admixture vaccines may provide a future therapy
to protect against the accidental exposure to other fentanyl-contaminated
drugs.

Experimental Section
Animals
Immunization and blood collection
were performed
as detailed in our previous study with the following differences.23 Female Balb/cByJ (Taconic Farms, Germantown,
NY) were vaccinated subcutaneously (sc) with 100 μg of the immunoconjugate.
The details of the schedule of experiments and vaccination are listed
in Table 1. Mice were
bled on days 24 and 38 by submandibular puncture with a single-use
lancet to collect 100–500 μL of whole blood. Each group
was composed of either 12 or 18 mice. The mice were weighed weekly,
and any injection site reaction was measured on the day of behavioral
testing (Figures S5 and S6, respectively).
The mice were group-housed in an AAALAC-accredited vivarium. All animal
care and experimental procedures adhered to the guidelines of the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals, and experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of The Scripps Research Institute.

Preparation, Formulation, and Administration of Vaccine
Fentanyl was acquired from Sigma–Aldrich, and heroin was provided
by NIDA. Heroin is soluble in bacteriostatic 0.9% NaCl solution; however,
the fentanyl solubility in aqueous solution is limited (0.2 mg/mL
in water). Therefore, fentanyl was dissolved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide,
10% Tween 80, and saline for drug administration. Heroin24 and fentanyl haptens11 were synthesized per our literature procedure, and protein conjugation
proceeded as previously described.23 Vaccines
were formulated with 50% (v/v) glycerol and 50 μg of CpG/dose
per mouse and stored at −80 °C. Immediately prior to administration,
the vaccines were thawed and mixed with 0.8 mg of alum/dose per mouse
for at least half an hour.

Hapten Density Determination by Matrix-Assisted
Laser Desorption
Ionization
The heroin and fentanyl hapten densities on carrier
proteins were assessed using MALDI-time-of-flight (matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization-ToF) and electrospray ionization-ToF mass
spectrometry analysis as described in our previous publications.22,23 The immunoconjugate spectra are reported in the Supporting Information (Figures S1–S4). A summary of
the results is located in Table 1.

ELISA
The serum midpoint titers
were determined as
reported in our previous study.23 Sera
from control mice either did not contain any antibodies or showed
a very minor titer against Her-BSA or Fent-BSA.

SPR to Measure
Affinity Values
The binding IC50 values were acquired
and analyzed by SPR over week 3 and 5 bleeds
to observe the effect of subsequent vaccination on affinity to free
heroin (6-AM) or fentanyl (or analogues) as previously reported.11,23 Analogues of fentanyl were run against week 5 bleeds from Fent and
Fent + Her vaccination groups.

Antinociceptive Behavioral
Assays
Mice were tested
for cumulative drug response in supraspinal (hot plate) and spinal
(tail flick) behavioral tests as described in our prior study.21,23 For 10% fentanyl to heroin, the following doses were used for fentanyl
and heroin: 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.25, 0.45, and 0.85 mg/kg and
0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, and 8.5 mg/kg, respectively.
