Solid oxide fuel
cells are highly efficient, low-emission, and
fuel-flexible energy conversion devices that can also run in reverse
as solid oxide electrolysis cells, converting CO2 and/or
H2O to useful fuels and pure O2. Our team has
recently developed a highly promising mixed conducting oxide catalyst
(La0.3Ca0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3−δ) that can be used at both the anode and cathode
in either the fuel cell or electrolysis mode in a lower-cost symmetrical
cell. However, there is still a need to improve material processing
and cell manufacturing methods in this field. Here, we report, for
the first time, fabrication of a symmetrical solid oxide cell, based
on our very promising catalysts, using rapid, low-cost, low-energy,
and green microwave (MW) processing techniques. These cells were fabricated
with MW-sintered powders and were then MW-sintered without the use
of any MW susceptors inside the electrode layers or any additional
presintering steps. The catalyst layers show very stable nanostructures
and do not delaminate, and the cells exhibit reaction rates that are
similar to those obtained using normal ceramic processing methods.
Importantly, the powder preparation and cell sintering steps, carried
out using MW methods, require only ca. 1/3 and 1/9 of the time/energy,
respectively, versus those required in traditional furnace methods,
thus translating to significant cost savings.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
use of microwave (MW) methods in ceramic material processing
has recently become an active area of research, primarily because
the properties of ceramics depend strongly on the fabrication methods
employed.1 MW methods have been shown to
enhance the rate of diffusion of ions and atoms in solid–solid
reactions by several orders of magnitude, thus shortening reaction
times and lowering reaction temperature.1b,2 MW-assisted
techniques are also understood to be environmentally friendly, as
they require less energy than that required by conventional material
processing methods. This makes MW synthesis an excellent example of
“Green Chemistry”.3 It is
also known that MW sintering of ceramics leads to a more rapid heating
rate and higher heating efficiency, resulting in lower thermal stress
gradients.4

Although MW-assisted
processing is being increasingly used for
the preparation of materials for solar cells,5 organic synthesis,6 digestion processes,7 and so forth, its use is still new in the domain
of fuel cells and electrolysis cells, including in solid oxide fuel
cells (SOFCs) and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), described
together as solid oxide cells (SOCs).8 In
this area, several groups have used MW methods to prepare (sinter)
oxide ion conducting pellets for use as solid electrolytes, including
yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), the most commonly employed electrolyte
in SOCs. When MW-prepared using a multimode MW furnace at 2.45 GHz,9 the sintering temperature of YSZ was shown to
be lowered by ca. 100 °C compared to that in conventional sintering
methods and a finer grain size was also produced.10 Our group has also recently prepared gadolinium-doped ceria
(GDC) powder, another common electrolyte material, using MW methods,
giving a higher ionic conductivity compared to what is normally achieved
for GDC using conventional furnace-based ceramic processing methods.11

In terms of electrode materials, we have
recently synthesized La0.3Ca0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3−δ (LCFCr) perovskites
using MW methods,12 shown previously to
have excellent activity and stability in both
air and fuel environments when running in either the fuel cell or
electrolysis mode.13,12 Other high-performance oxygen
electrode materials include La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ, which has
exhibited a low polarization resistance (Rp) of 0.18 Ω cm2 at 800 °C,14 La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Cu0.2O3−δ, which has demonstrated a very
low Rp of 0.07 Ω cm2,15 and La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Mn0.5O3, with a polarization resistance of
0.3 Ω cm2 in air at 800 °C.16

In our prior work, we have demonstrated that the
desired single-phase
material can be easily produced as a powder using MW processing techniques
and that the calcination temperature could be lowered by 200–300
°C versus those in conventional approaches.12 In terms of MW preparation of cells, only one group has
previously investigated the use of MW processing of a single SOFC.17 Jiao et al.17 used
commercially prepared metal oxide powders and then compared MW sintering
of commonly employed NiO-YSZ anode-supported cells (with a YSZ electrolyte
and using a screen-printed La1–xSrxMnO3 (LSM) cathode) to
that of conventional thermally sintered cells. Although this work
showed that the MW-sintered cells exhibited a higher initial performance,
this approach required multiple preparation steps, several conventional
furnace presintering steps, and two MW sintering steps. Furthermore,
the cells in this prior study17 the inclusion
of MW susceptor pellets (MW-active materials, such as 2.5ZnO–27MnO2–0.5Al2O3, ZMA) and thus additional
YSZ spacers had to be placed between the cell and the ZMA pellets
to avoid contamination of the electrodes by the ZMA, thus adding significant
complexity.

In the present work, we demonstrate, for the first
time, MW sintering
of an electrolyte-supported, symmetrical, solid oxide single cell,
constructed using our advanced mixed conducting LCFCr electrode materials
that are active in both the SOFC and SOEC modes. Importantly, these
cells were MW-constructed using MW-prepared LCFCr powders, with the
details of the powder synthesis procedure and characteristics published
elsewhere,12 and without the use of any
MW susceptor materials added into the cell. The LCFCr electrodes (each
ca. 30 μm thick) were screen-printed symmetrically onto gadolinia-doped
ceria (GDC) electrolytes of varying thicknesses prior to MW cell sintering,
coated with Au paste as the current collectors (Figure S1), and then tested in air using impedance analysis.

2 Results and Discussion
Cell fabrication (see Supporting Information (SI)) was accomplished
using a multimode MW oven (Figure S2) that
allowed both electrical and magnetic couplings
with the mixed conducting LCFCr material, as well as the ionically
conducting GDC electrolyte.23,24 The cell was constructed
without the use of any other presintering steps or the inclusion of
MW susceptor pellets inside the SOC. Although the GDC electrolyte
(0.25 and 1 mm thick) used in these cells was commercially obtained,
we have previously shown that GDC electrolytes can easily be synthesized
and sintered using MW methods.11,18

The novel and
very promising SOC powder and cell sintering methodology
used here are shown to significantly lower both the manufacturing
temperature (from 1100 to 900 °C) and time (from 13 to 7 h for
powder sintering and from 10 to 1.6 h for cell sintering), thus translating
to a significantly lower cost and energy consumption. Although the
work reported here was carried out in symmetrical cells in air, it
has been previously shown13b,19 that LCFCr is equally
active at the fuel electrode in CO2/CO environments and
in both half-cell and full-cell configurations. Thus, MW processing
can be considered for the construction of full cells for use in either/both
SOFC or/and SOEC applications.

Five types of cells (labeled
as cells 1–5, Table 1), each reproduced at least
two times, were constructed by MW sintering using a Milestone MultiFAST-6
MW instrument (without the use of a conventional furnace). Here, the
polarization resistances reported (Rp)
in Table 1 correspond
to the data shown in Figures 1 and 2, with an estimated 5% error
in cell-to-cell reproducibility. Because of its silicon carbide crucibles
(see SI), this MW fusion system was able
to reach temperatures of ca. 1000 °C in only a few minutes. Four
different MW sintering temperatures were targeted (600, 700, 850,
and 900 °C) to identify the optimum conditions for cell sintering
using MW energy.

°C). The MW-prepared LCFCr electrocatalyst was deposited on both
sides of a 1 mm thick GDC electrolyte disc, and the impedance response
was obtained in stagnant air at 800 °C. The equivalent circuit
used for data fitting is the same as that shown in Figure 1b. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)

d Measured in
a two-electrode LCFCr/GDC/LCFCr
half-cell configuration, running at 800 °C in a pO2 = 0.21 atm and with a 50 mL/min flow rate. Rp represents the polarization resistance per
electrode, and Rs is the series resistance,
both determined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

Although the MW sintering time
(tsint) at the desired temperature was
always 20 min for cell types 1–5,
the ramp-up time (tramp) was adjusted
to attempt to reach the targeted temperature. Specifically, the ramp-up
time (tramp) was 30 min for cells 1, 4,
and 5 and 45 min for cells 2 and 3 (Table 1, Figure S3).
Although the MW cell sintering temperature was measured with an infrared
sensor directly in a silicon carbide crucible, there are inherent
difficulties in precisely measuring the “true” sample
temperature during MW exposure and thus the temperatures are reported1 to only to a few significant figures in Table 1.

Cells A and
B (Table 1) served
as the comparison benchmarks, having also been constructed
using MW-combusted LCFCr powders (to keep this a constant factor throughout
this study) and then screen-printed on either a 0.25 mm or a 1 mm
thick GDC electrolyte, respectively, but then sintered using a conventional
furnace. To clearly compare the effect of conventional furnace sintering
time and temperature, these two cells were heated at 1100 °C
for 2 h at a ramp-up rate of 5 °C/min (5 h), which are our typical
electrode furnace sintering conditions.13,19,20 Considering the ramp-up time (tramp), sintering time (tsint),
and cooling time (tcool), the overall
electrode sintering time (ttotal) for
the conventional furnace preparation of cells A and B was 10 h (Table 1).

The initial
set of experiments was focused on MW-sintered cells
constructed with a 0.25 mm thick GDC electrolyte (cells 1–3),
similar to what was used in our previous work with furnace-prepared
cells.13a,21 These cells were sintered using the same
MW frequency and power (2.45 GHz and 1500 W), but with a varying ramp-up
time, with the aim being to reach sintering temperatures of 900 °C
(cells 1 and 2) and 700 °C (cell 3). However, as seen in Table 1, cells 1 and 2 could
only reach a sintering temperature of 850 °C, whereas cell 3
reached a sintering temperature of only 600 °C instead of 700
°C, even though the ramp-up times (tramp) were increased from 30 to 45 min in the construction of cells 2
and 3.

Figure 1a shows
the OCP impedance spectra of these three cells (250 μm GDC electrolyte)
in a 2-electrode half-cell configuration in air at 800 °C, with
the equivalent circuit used to fit the data shown in Figure 1b. Two time constants are seen
in each case, which is typical for LCFCr in air (and fuel) environments.13,19,20b,21 These two arcs have been explained as being due to the underlying
electrode–electrolyte interface (solid–solid interface)
and to the electrochemical reactions at/of the catalyst (solid–gas
interface) at high and low frequencies, respectively. Rp (polarization resistance of the cell), which is inversely
proportional to the reaction rate, is the difference between the two
real-axis intercepts of the impedance arcs and reflects the electrode
activity (Rp was divided by 2 to report
the polarization resistance corresponding to each electrode because
the cells were tested in a 2-electrode half-cell configuration). The
ohmic resistance (Rs) corresponds to the
intercept of the impedance arc with the real axis at high frequencies
and arises from the resistance of ion migration within the electrolyte,
resistance to electron transport within the cell components, and the
contact resistances. It is seen that Rs remains stable at ca. 0.30 Ω cm2 for all three
MW-sintered cells (cells 1–3).

Rp for cells 1 and 2, both MW-sintered
at 850 °C, decreased from 0.62 to 0.48 Ω cm2 (Table 1) when a
longer ramp-up time (45 min, cell 2) was used, even though the apparent
cell temperature did not change, whereas Rp of cell 3, MW-sintered at 600 °C but using a longer ramping
time of 45 min, was 0.60 Ω cm2. These Rp values are very reasonable, similar to those we have
reported previously for conventionally produced powders and furnace-sintered
(2 h at 1100 °C) LCFCr/GDC/LCFCr cells (0.4–0.5 Ω
cm2),22 also with a ca. 0.25
mm thick GDC electrolyte.

The impedance responses for cells
1 and 3 (Figure 1)
are different, with the circuit elements
obtained from the EIS fitting of the data in Figure 1 shown in Table S1. In our prior work, the high-frequency (HF) arc was ascribed to
oxygen ion transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface.23 The high-frequency capacitance (CHF) is seen
to be in the range of 10–3 F cm–2, which is in full agreement with this supposition and with our previous
work,13a,20b,20c specifically
for the LCFCr/GDC interfacial capacitance. We have also shown in our
previous work that the low-frequency resistance (RLF) decreases noticeably
with increasing temperature and thus it cannot be related to gas phase
diffusion limitations, which are known to be close to temperature-independent.23a RLF is assigned instead to the processes occurring
at the gas/electrode interface (e.g., O2 adsorption/dissociation).
Also, its associated capacitance (CLF) is very large (in the range
of 10–1 F cm–2), previously ascribed
to the chemical capacitance arising from the LCFCr redox chemistry.
As shown in Table S1, the main difference
between cells 1 and 3 is the relative contribution of the high-frequency
(RHF) and low-frequency (RLF) resistances to the total Rp. In cell 1, RHF (1.1 Ω cm2) is the
dominant contribution to Rp, whereas in
cell 3, RLF (0.93 Ω cm2) is the dominant resistance.
This indicates that the electrode/electrolyte interfacial properties
have been improved in cell 3 (MW-sintered at 600 °C) versus cell
1 (MW-sintered at 850 °C).

To test just the effect of the
method of cell sintering, cell A
was prepared using the same MW-sintered powders, but by furnace sintering
of the full cell. This resulted in a similar EIS response (Figure 1) and in similar Rs and Rp values
of 0.28 and 0.45 Ω cm2, respectively. Overall, the
performance achieved with cells 1–3 is very good, reaching
the levels expected for SOFCs at 800 °C, considering especially
that the MW sintering temperature and time were so much lower than
those normally used in conventional furnace-processing (cell A). This
demonstrates that reasonable performances can be achieved with MW
processing, but with much less time and energy used (see SI).

Because of the challenges in reaching
the targeted sintering temperatures
of 700 and 900 °C in cells 1–3 (Table 1), efforts were made to increase the sintering
temperature by adding more GDC into the cell, as its high ionic conductivity
under oxidizing conditions was anticipated to enhance the coupling
of the sample to the electrical component of the MW wave. Thus, to
also maintain control of sample geometry, the GDC pellet thickness
was increased from 0.25 to 1 mm in cells 4 and 5, also as these thicker
GDC pellets were available commercially. These cells were then MW-sintered
at 700 and 900 °C, respectively, while keeping both the sintering
time (tsint) and the ramp time (tramp) (Figure S3)
constant at 20 and 30 min, respectively (Table 1).

The EIS results obtained for these
two 1 mm GDC-supported cells
(cells 4 and 5), again at the OCP and at 800 °C in air, are shown
in Figure 2a. These
cells show a lower Rp than that seen in Figure 1, where a thinner
GDC electrolyte was used, now giving Rp values (Table 1)
of 0.40 (cell 4) and 0.25 Ω cm2 (cell 5), with the
latter value being the lowest of all of the cells evaluated here (MW-sintered
at 900 °C for 20 min). Rs ranged
between 0.28 and 0.34 Ω cm2 in Figure 1 but was higher (0.56–0.77 Ω
cm2) for the 4 times thicker electrolyte, as expected.
The difference observed in Rs for cells
4 and 5 (0.71 and 0.56 Ω cm2) may be due to better
electrode sintering within cell 5, as the temperature inside the MW
chamber was 200 °C higher than when cell 4 was prepared. The
fact that Rs did not scale linearly with
GDC thickness may reflect varying qualities of the GDC/LCFCr or LCFCr/Au
interfaces. CV studies (Figure 2b) were also carried out, showing the robustness of the cells
and the good performance of the LCFCr electrodes under polarization.

Importantly, although Rs is higher
for cells 4 and 5 (Figure 2) than for cells 1–3 (Figure 1), as expected, the Rp values of the 1 mm MW-sintered GDC cells are significantly
lower (by a factor of ca. 2, Table 1) than those for the cells based on the 250 μm
MW-sintered GDC cells. This is likely because the cells with the thicker
GDC electrolyte (cells 4 and 5) more easily reached the desired sintering
temperature (700 and 900 °C, respectively) as compared with cells
with thinner electrolyte layers (cells 1–3). Figure S4 demonstrates that the thickness of the GDC electrolyte
affects only Rs and not the electrochemical
reaction rates, as seen by the very similar Rp values obtained (0.45 Ω cm2 (cell A) and
0.50 Ω cm2 (cell B)). To avoid the higher Rs values associated with thicker GDC electrolytes
and yet include GDC in the cell, one possible solution would be to
use a thin GDC electrolyte but then to infiltrate the MW-prepared/sintered
LCFCr electrode scaffold with GDC. The infiltration of GDC has been
shown in a parallel work to significantly increase the performance
of the LCFCr electrocatalyst in air.20c

Similar to what was done for the 250 μm thick GDC cells,
EIS performance data for a furnace-sintered cell (cell B), also using
a 1 mm thick GDC electrolyte but MW-prepared LCFCr electrode powders,
were collected for comparison (Figure 2 and Table 1). Cell B gave an Rp value of
0.50 Ω cm2 (Table 1), showing that the MW-processed cells exhibited a
notably better performance than that of the furnace-sintered (but
otherwise identical) cell.

In terms of cell performance under
polarization, Figure S8 shows the open
circuit Nyquist plots after 3, 10,
24, 36, 48, and 100 h of polarization at half-cell voltages of 0.2
V, in air, for cell 5 and cell B. Figure S8 shows that the cells performed very well initially but then the
current decreased, gradually approaching a steady state. This was
also the case for the conventional furnace-sintered cell (cell B)
that employed the MW-prepared LCFCr electrocatalyst, indicating that
further optimization of the MW powder/cell sintering conditions is
needed. The cells did not fall apart and the electrodes did not delaminate
from the electrolyte and thus it is possible that the degradation
may be due to current collector issues, with optimization of the MW-sintering
steps currently underway to minimize this.

To better understand
the effect of MW sintering of cells on their
very good (and sometimes even superior) performance as compared to
that of the furnace-sintered analogues, Figure 3a shows comparative field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of the LCFCr electrode within
cell 5 (MW-prepared powder deposited on 1 mm thick GDC, followed by
MW sintering of the cell), whereas Figure 3b presents a similar view of the analogous
MW-sintered LCFCr powder, but furnace-prepared, cell, also on a 1
mm thick GDC electrolyte (cell B). For comparison, Figure S5 shows an image of the MW-combustion LCFCr powder
alone, showing a spongelike porous morphology that is similar to what
is seen in Figure 3a, after the powder was MW-sintered to the GDC electrolyte.

Figure 3 Cross-sectional
FE-SEM views of the morphology of the LCFCr electrode
material on a 1 mm thick GDC electrolyte for (a) cell 5 (MW-prepared
LCFCr powders followed by MW sintering of the cell) and (b) cell B
(MW-prepared powders followed by furnace sintering of the cell).

In this work, the furnace-sintered
cells were prepared using MW-prepared
LCFCr, but otherwise involving the same methods as those used in our
previous work.19−21,24 Notably, in our earlier
work, the LCFCr powders were prepared by the regular combustion method
rather than MW methods. Thus, the MW sintering conditions must still
be optimized. For comparison, Figure S6 shows the microstructure of two different cells after testing. Both
cells were furnace-sintered using the same conditions, but the cell
in (a) was fabricated with MW-synthesized powders and the cell in
(b) was produced using regular combustion-synthesized LCFCr. Here,
the different microstructures can be clearly observed.

Figure 3a indicates
that an average particle size of ca. 50 nm is observed in the as-prepared
condition for MW-sintered cell 5. The formation of nanoparticles is
consistent with what has been reported previously in terms of nanomaterial
production through MW processing.25 For
cell B, prepared using conventional furnace sintering (Figure 3b), much larger LCFCr particle
sizes in the range of 1 μm are seen, typical of what is produced
at the higher temperatures of a combustion process followed by furnace
sintering.

To determine if there were any changes in the LCFCr
electrode morphologies
after electrochemical testing, the same two cells (MW-sintered cell
5 vs furnace-sintered cell B, both using a 1 mm thick GDC electrolyte)
were compared (Figure 4) before and after 100 h of impedance evaluation at the OCP at 800
°C in air. Figure 4a,b shows that the MW-prepared LCFCr electrodes in the MW-sintered
cell exhibit an average particle size of ca. 65 nm both before and
after electrochemical testing (Figure 4a). In comparison, the cross-sectional SEM images of
the as-prepared LCFCr electrode in cell B (MW-prepared electrodes,
followed by conventional furnace sintering of the cell) reveal an
average LCFCr particle size of ca. 0.8 μm before (Figure 4c) and 1.5 μm after (Figure 4d) testing, showing
some particle sintering. However, when MW processing was used for
cell sintering, the particles did not agglomerate as much and maintained
their high-surface-area structure, even after 100 h at 800 °C
(Figure 4b vs Figure 4d). This correlates
with the lower Rp of cell 5 (0.25 Ω
cm2) versus ca. 0.5 Ω cm2 for cell B.

Figure 4 Cross-sectional
FE-SEM views of the LCFCr electrodes before (a,
c) and after (b, d) impedance evaluation at the OCP in air for 100
h. (a, b) cell 5 (MW-prepared powder followed by MW sintering of the
cell at 900 °C for 20 min) and (c, d) cell B (MW-prepared powder
followed by furnace sintering of the cell at 1100 °C for 2 h).

After 100 h at a cell voltage
of 0.2 V in air at 800 °C, some
degradation in the cell Rp was observed
for both the MW-sintered (cell 5) and furnace-sintered (cell B) cells.
This indicates that the MW-prepared LCFCr electrode layers continued
to sinter during cell operation, consistent with the SEM images in Figure 4. The most significant
degradation was seen in RLF, whereas Rs and RHF remained almost unchanged. According to our model,20 this would indicate that the majority of the
degradation arises from changes at the LCFCr catalyst/air interface,
perhaps due to a decrease in active surface area. This shows that
further optimization of the MW sintering steps is still needed.

On the basis of these SEM images, the decrease in Rp of MW-prepared cell 5 (vs that of analogous furnace-prepared
cell B) (Table 1) is
in full agreement with the smaller LCFCr electrocatalyst particle
size (65 nm in cell 5 vs 1 μm in cell B), observed by FE-SEM
imaging (Figures 3 and 4). As shown in Figure 2 and Table 1, the ohmic resistance values also decrease, showing
the same trend as that for the polarization resistance (cell 5 <
cell 4 < cell B). Cell 5 (MW-sintered at 900 °C) exhibits
the lowest Rp as well as a lower ohmic
resistance of 0.56 Ω cm2 (Table 1), which may be an indication that a better
contact was achieved at the electrode–electrolyte interface
as the GDC electrode thickness (1 μm) was unchanged.

3 Conclusions
Here, we have demonstrated, for the first
time, that it is possible
to fabricate a symmetrical SOC, employing advanced mixed conducting
oxide electrodes that can be used in either the fuel cell (SOFC) or
electrolysis (SOEC) modes, entirely by MW-assisted methods. This was
achieved without the addition of any MW susceptors, as was required
in a previous study with a standard Ni/YSZ/LSM SOFC. Five different
types of cells were constructed using MW-presynthesized LCFCr perovskites,
materials that can be used as both the anode and the cathode catalyst,
and then MW-sintered onto GDC electrolytes. In this study, the cells
were tested in a half-cell configuration in air, using EIS at 800
°C, with the results compared to those of several cells that
were also constructed using the MW-prepared LCFCr catalysts, but were
furnace-sintered in the conventional way.

The results have demonstrated
that MW preparation/sintering of
SOC cells is possible, producing cells that are quite robust and without
any electrode layer delamination. These cells displayed similar activities
as those seen for cells prepared using conventional furnace methods,
but with significantly lower processing/preparation times required.
This may be related to the fact that cells sintered with MW methods
had an average particle size of ca. 65 nm (and hence a higher surface
area), even after 100 h at temperature, which is significantly smaller
than the particles formed in cells sintered using a conventional furnace
(ca. 1 μm). While some performance degradation was observed
over 100 h of polarization, the cells did not delaminate or show any
obvious mechanical changes and the LCFCr particle size also remained
unchanged. We speculate that performance degradation arises primarily
from the current collector/LCFCr interface, with ongoing studies focussed
on further optimizing the sintering conditions to minimize degradation
rates.

The GDC electrolyte thickness was shown to play an important
role
in achieving the desired sintering temperature by MW methods, with
the thicker (1 mm) electrolytes successfully reaching the desired
temperatures. Although cells with a thicker GDC electrolyte gave a
higher series resistance, as expected, the polarization resistance
was consistently lower than that for the thinner GDC electrolytes.
Our results also suggest that the amount of GDC in the cell may improve
the MW cell sinterability, possibly as the ionically conducting GDC
phase serves the role of the MW susceptor. We also believe that the
GDC thickness influenced the quality of the electrode/electrolyte
interfacial adhesion, with more work being done currently to better-understand
this observation.

Overall, the novel and very promising SOC
powder and cell sintering
methodology developed here are shown to significantly lower the manufacturing
temperature (from 1100 to 900 °C), processing time (from 13 to
7 h for powder sintering and from 10 to 1.5 h for cell sintering),
and energy requirements, due also to the much lower energy requirements
of the MW furnace (Table S2). The MW cells
also showed a very low polarization resistance of 0.25 Ω cm2 per electrode at 800 °C, which is in the range of the
best cathodes prepared by others using conventional solid state material
synthesis methods and cell sintering by conventional furnace heating.
This translates to significant manufacturing cost savings, making
MW processing of SOCs a very promising route for the future.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
4.1.1 Chemicals
All chemicals were purchased
from Alfa Aesar, as follows: glycine (99.5%); La(NO3)3·6H2O (99.9%); Sr(NO3)2 (99.0%); Ca(NO3)2 (99.0%); Cr(NO3)·9H2O (98.5%); and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (98%).

4.1.2 MW-Assisted
Synthesis of LCFCr
All of the LCFCr powders were synthesized
by MW-assisted combustion.
Here, the metal nitrates and glycine were dissolved in deionized water
using the metal cation proportions required to generate the correct
oxide stoichiometry. A 2:1 mole ratio of glycine to the total metal
content was used. The stirred solutions were introduced into the MW
furnace and exposed to a 2.45 GHz frequency and 800 W for 30 min.
When the water had evaporated, combustion occurred. The final powdered
sample was then ground using an agate mortar and pestle and calcined
in air at 900 °C for 6 h to decompose the organic remnants, rendering
a black powder as the final product. The LCFCr powders were milled
(high-energy planetary ball mill, Pulverisette 5, Fritsch, Germany)
in an isopropanol medium at a rotation speed of 300 rpm for 2 h, using
zirconia balls.

4.1.3 Cell Construction
The ca. 30 μm
thick LCFCr electrodes were screen-printed symmetrically (over an
area of 0.5 cm2) onto both sides of a GDC electrolyte (fuel
cell materials, either 1 mm or 250 μm thick), forming a symmetrical
LCFCr/GDC/LCFCr cell. Au paste (C 5729, Heraeus Inc., Germany) was
painted on each of the electrode layers to serve as the current collectors
(Figure S1).

4.1.4 MW
Cell Sintering
In the present
case, the ceria electrolyte (as it is a pure ionic conductor under
oxidizing conditions) clearly couples with the electric component
of the MW, whereas the electrodes, due to their metallic nature,26 will preferentially couple with the magnetic
component of the MWs. Therefore, heating in a multimode setup (such
as the multimode Milestone MultiFAST-6 MW used in this work, Figure S2) was the best option because both interactions
occur simultaneously. It is also important to note that we used SiC
crucibles to sinter the cells. SiC readily and strongly couples with
the 2.45 GHz MWs used here, which may have helped in rapidly increasing
the temperature (minutes), while also providing a more uniform thermal
environment, thus avoiding “hot spots” in the cells
being heated.

It is well established from single-mode MW irradiation
experiments (not used here) that different materials exhibit very
different behaviors with regard to the electric and magnetic components
of the MW energy employed. Single-mode or monomode reactors are second-generation
MW instruments, where the MWs utilized for heating are polarized and
exhibit minima and maxima in their amplitude. In a single-mode reactor,
the field is well-defined in space and the material must be placed
in a particular location within the cavity, either where the amplitude
maximum of the magnetic field (H) corresponds with
a minimum of the electric field (E) in the magnetic
mode or vice versa (electric mode). In general, conductive samples,
such as metals, can be much more efficiently heated in the magnetic
mode, whereas ceramic insulators with low conductivity, such as Al2O3 or ZnO, show much higher heating rates in the
electric field.26 If ceramics and metals
are combined in a composite system, sample heating may result from
interactions with both the electric and magnetic fields. As mentioned
earlier, the use of a multimode MW furnace here was more appropriate
because our cells contain a pure ionic conductor (electrolyte) that
couples with the electric field. However, our mixed conducting LCFCr
electrode materials couple with the electrical field, but also with
the magnetic part of the MW energy, due to their metallic nature.26a,26

4.1.5 Material Characterization
All cells
were examined by FE-SEM after first sputter-coating with a thin layer
of Au in an EMITECH K550 apparatus. The FE-SEM imaging of the cells
and attached electrode layers was carried out using a Zeiss ∑igma
VP field emission SEM. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected
using a Philips X’Pert PRO ALPHA1 of Panalytical B.V. diffractometer
with Cu Kα1 monochromatic radiation (λ = 1.54056
Å). The diffractometer was equipped with a primary curved Ge111
primary beam monochromator and a speed X’Celerator fast detector,
operating at 45 kV and 40 mA. XRD patterns were collected in the 2θ
range of 5–80 ° at room temperature. The XRD pattern of
the LCFCr phase after MW sintering is shown in Figure S7, showing LCFCr phases identical to those reported
for LCFCr in our previous work.13

4.1.6 Electrochemical Measurements
In
all of this work, the electrochemical measurements to evaluate cell
performance were carried out using 2-electrode methods in air. Electrochemical
impedance spectra were collected under open circuit conditions at
800 °C, using an ac amplitude of 50 mV in the frequency range
of 0.01–65 kHz and using a Solartron 1287/1255 potentiostat/galvanostat/impedance
analyzer. Half-cells 1–5 and A–B were also examined
by CV and for up to 100 h at various half-cell voltages using the
same instrumentation. Zview software was used to fit and analyze the
impedance data.
