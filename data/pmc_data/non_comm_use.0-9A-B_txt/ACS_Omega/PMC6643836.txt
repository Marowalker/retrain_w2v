Graphene
has attracted lots of researchers attention because of
its remarkable conductivity in both electrically and thermally. However,
it has poor dispersibility in organic solvents which limited its applications.
Polymers with aromatic end group which act as an intercalator were
prepared by ring-opening polymerization with ε-caprolactone
by utilizing 1-naphthalene methanol (1-NM) as an initiator. These
intercalators will exist between graphene oxide (GO) sheets to prevent
aggregation via interactions. The attachment of 1-NM on polymer chains
was supported by ultraviolet–visible spectra, size exclusion
chromatography profiles, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance
spectra. Exfoliated structured functionalized GO (fGO)/polycaprolactone
(PCL) (synthesized fGO) nanocomposites that dispersed well in acetone,
chloroform, N,N-dimethylformamide,
dimethyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene were successfully
synthesized. This agreed well with the enlarged interlayer spacing
in the optimized fGO as compared to that of GO from density functional
theory simulations using the DMol3 module that implemented
in the Materials Studio 6.0. Furthermore, its potential to be applied
as green electronics in electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries
was presented, by trailering the thermal conductivity enhancement
from the incorporation of fGO/PCL with commercialized biodegradable
polymers, PCL, and poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid].

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
discovery of graphene has sparked the evolution of materials
as the most recent superior material in human history. It has atomically
thick sp2-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb
structure within a two-dimensional lattice. The unique plane structure
and geometry of monolayer graphene contribute to its incredible properties.
It is thin flake and lightweight. This material is the strongest material
ever measured and possesses Young’s modulus of 1 TPa and an
ultimate strength of 130 GPa.1 In addition,
it has excellent electrical (∼6000 S/cm)2 and thermal conductivities (∼5000 W/mK),3 a large specific surface area (2630 m2/g), and gas impermeability.4 Owing to
its excellent properties, it can be utilized as conductive ink and/or
paste for printed circuits in electronics, sensors, and so forth for
internet of things and any subtracts such as clothes, skin, glass,
and so forth for various applications.

In this modern era, people
are living in a world of electronics,
from home and office, to industries, and even outer space. Electronic
devices either low-powered or high-powered are consuming power and
generating intense heat which causes low performance and efficiency.
Additionally, continued miniaturization of electronic devices requires
them to be lightweight, efficient heat dissipation, easy to deform,
and affordable by customers. Consequently, thermally conductive polymer
composites emerged as heat removers in various applications such as
heat exchangers, electric generators, power electronics, and so forth.5 Furthermore, the key prerequisite for achieving
sustainability in the electronic industry is the usage of electronic
devices that benign integration into life and environment, which are
known as green electronics.

Graphene appears to be the most
promising candidate for the production
of green electronic that possesses various incredible properties especially
thermal and electrical conductivities, electromagnetic shielding,
and mechanical enhancement, by incorporating it with biodegradable
polymers. However, because of the high surface area, van der Waals
force, and π–π interactions of graphene sheets,
these multilayered sheets tend to aggregate and cause dispersion problems
in various solvents and polymer matrices. The dispersion of fillers
within a polymer matrix plays an important role in achieving good
properties for the composites.

Hence, surface modification of
graphene is crucial to improve its
solubility and dispersibility, and these modifications can be performed
via covalent and noncovalent methods. Covalent methods involve the
addition of organic groups such as amines and polymers via amide or
ester bonds on the graphene surface, followed by the transformation
of the hybridized atoms from sp2 to sp3.6 Ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of ε-caprolactone
(ε-CL) with graphene oxide (GO) as an initiator successfully
obtained an exfoliated polycaprolactone (PCL)–GO composites
through generation of PCL from hydroxy groups on the surface of GO.7 However, the main drawback for this modification
method is that the aromatic systems of the graphene are disrupted;
therefore, the graphene derivatives compromised electrical conductivity
and mechanical properties.8

Noncovalent
methods include π–π stacking interactions,
hydrophobic effects, van der Waals forces, and electrostatic interactions.6 These noncovalent methods can maximally preserve
graphene’s original structure, whereas molecules adsorb on
its surfaces.8 Melt processing, solvent
processing, and in situ polymerization are the most common methods
for preparing graphene nanocomposites with noncovalent interactions.9 A co-continuous structure was obtained by trapping
graphene at the interface of PCL/polylactic acid blend, resulted in
improved thermal conductivity and extremely low thermal percolation
threshold.10 Compared to solution mixing
methods, a well-dispersed graphene-based filler can be obtained via
in situ polymerization without a prior exfoliation step.11 In situ intercalation polymerization, where
the monomer is intercalated between layers of graphene or GO, followed
by polymerization to prevent aggregation, has been reported.12 Jang et al. proposed a novel method to prepare
nanocomposites between GO and poly(methyl methacrylate) by utilizing
a macro-azoinitiator (MAI).12 The MAI acted
as an intercalator and exfoliated GO. Nanocomposites prepared by this
technique have improved in conductivity.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of PCL in the
Presence of 1-Naphthalene
Methanol/Tin(II) 2-Ethylhexanoate and Butanol/Tin(II) 2-Ethylhexanoate
Catalytic System
It is commonly known that synthesis of PCL
via ROP involves an alcohol (R–OH) as an initiator and tin(II)
2-ethylhexanoate, Sn(Oct)2, as a catalyst. In order to
confirm PCL generated from hydroxy group of 1-NM on size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) measurement, aromatic and aliphatic alcohols
were, respectively, used as initiators, 1-NM and butanol, to form
PCL in this study. This set of experiments give basic understanding
of synthesized PCL with different kinds of initiators. Table 1 shows the similar polydispersity
index from both synthesized PCL. The structure of the synthesized
PCL was characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR) spectra, as shown in Figure S1. The results clearly indicate that typical 1H
NMR chemical shifts at 1.38 (CH2CH2CH2COO), 1.64 (CH2CH2COO), 2.30 (CH2COO), 4.06 (CH2OCO), and 3.65 (CH2CH) ppm were
associated with PCL in both spectra.13 Incorporation
of 1-NM into PCL chains is confirmed with the proton peaks at 5.58
(C10H7CH2OH) and 7.30–8.00
(C10H7CH2) ppm which
can be observed in Figure S1a.

a Reaction
conditions: ε-CL
26 mmol; 1-NM and butanol 0.2 mmol; DMF 3 mL; tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate
catalytic amounts; T = 75 °C.

Figure 1 shows the
SEC profiles of synthesized PCL (with 1-NM) and PCL (with butanol).
However, SEC profiles of both PCL were significantly different. The
changes in the UV/RI intensity ratio of each fraction in SEC profiles
of the synthesized PCLs, PCL (with 1-NM), and PCL (with butanol) are
exhibited in Figure 1. They act as an indicator for the attachment of aromatic hydrocarbon,
1-NM on PCL chain. It was found that there is a high value in the
UV/RI ratio value of PCL generated from 1-NM. Figure 1a indicates alike shape and similar average
molecular weights of both RI and UV profiles for PCL (with 1-NM).
The [1-NM] unit ratio of each fraction in the SEC profile was nearly
constant in the range of 0.37–0.44 over the whole peak profile.
According to Figure 1b, PCL that synthesized with butanol does not have significant UV
profile and any [aromatic] unit ratio because it categorized as a
nonaromatic compound. The UV absorption of ε-CL unit is considered
to be negligible as compared to that of the 1-NM unit.14 Therefore, the monitored UV can be interpreted
as the distribution of 1-NM unit.

butanol).

2.2 Mechanism
and Theoretical Results of Pseudo-Surface
Modification
The first step of the ROP involved the formation
of active species (C10H7CH2 O−)
by reacting the 1-NM and tin catalyst. Subsequently, the nucleophilic
attack of the alkoxide bond of active species on the carbonyl group
of ε-CL to obtain PCL with aromatic end groups, which act as
an intercalator as shown in Scheme 1a. These polymers intercalated between GO sheets as
shown in Scheme 1b
via noncovalent interactions to prevent stacking of GO sheets to occur.
“Pseudo-surface modification” was inspired by these
pretentious and pseudo interactions between GO and intercalator.

Scheme 1 (a) Hypothetical Mechanisms of the ROP of ε-CL in the Presence
of 1-Naphthalene Methanol/Tin(II) 2-Ethylhexanoate Catalytic System
and (b) Route for Synthesis of Intercalated fGO/PCL Nanocomposites
From density functional theory
(DFT) simulation, the interlayer
spacing of optimized fGO simulation cell was 1.33 nm and was slightly
larger than that of GO simulation cell, which was 1.10 nm. This result
proved the effectiveness of the proposed pseudo-surface modification
in preventing aggregation of GO.

The interaction energy was
estimated from the energy difference
(ΔE) between the total potential energy of
the GO/monomer system and the sum of the potential energies of the
individual molecules as shown in the equation below15  where Einteraction is the interaction
potential energy (−8 kcal/mol), Etotal is the total potential energy of the GO/monomer
system (−3 671 390 kcal/mol), EGO is the potential energy of GO (−3 115 116 kcal/mol), and Emonomer is the potential energy of ε-CL
(−556 266 kcal/mol). The negative value of interaction energy
indicated that GO and monomer were attracted to each other.16 Furthermore, the systems were thermodynamically
stable and exothermic.16

2.3 Dispersibility of fGO/PCL Nanocomposites in
Organic Solvents
fGO/PCL nanocomposites were prepared via
ROP in the presence of 1-NM with 5 and 10 mg of GO, which named 0.19
wt % fGO/PCL and 0.36 wt % fGO/PCL, respectively. Tables 1 and 2 indicate the similar polydispersity index from PCL (with 1-NM) and
fGO/PCL nanocomposites. Nevertheless, PCL (with 1-NM) presented the
highest molecular weights as compared to that of fGO/PCL nanocomposites.

Table 2 Results of Molecular Weights, Polydispersity
Index, and Yield of fGO/PCL Nanocompositesa
sample	Mn (g/mol)	Mw (g/mol)	Mw/Mn	yield (%)	
0.19 wt % fGO/PCL	14 900	15 600	1.05	85	
0.36 wt % fGO/PCL	11 800	12 600	1.07	90	
0.37 wt % fGO/PCL*	10 900	15 900	1.46	88	
a Reaction conditions: GO 5 mg or
10 mg; ε-CL 26 mmol; 1-NM and butanol 0.2 mmol; DMF 3 mL; tin(II)
2-ethylhexanoate catalytic amounts; T = 75 °C; t = 18 h. Reaction conditions for *: GO 46 mg; ε-CL
120 mmol; 1-NM 0.2 mmol; DMF 4 mL; tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate catalytic
amounts; T = 75 °C; t = 64
h.

In order to prepare higher
molecular weight of fGO/PCL, 0.37 wt
% fGO/PCL* was synthesized by using ratio of ε-CL to 1-NM equal
to 600 and extended reaction time to 64 h.

As illustrated in Figure 2, both fGO/PCL nanocomposites
showed similar trends of the
ratio of UV to RI to that of PCL (with 1-NM). This proves the attachment
of 1-NM in PCL chains in both nanocomposites. The [1-NM] unit ratios
for 0.19 wt % fGO/PCL and 0.36 wt % fGO/PCL were nearly constant in
the range of 0.47–0.54 and 0.50–0.58, respectively.

Figure 2 SEC profiles
monitored by RI and UV detectors and [1-NM] unit ratio
for (a) 0.19 wt % fGO/PCL and (b) 0.36 wt % fGO/PCL.

GO readily dissolves in water and some solvents
with high boiling
point such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.17 However, dispersion in common organic solvents mainly the one with
low boiling point such as acetone, chloroform, and tetrahydrofuran
(THF) is the most typical problem faced by GO. The aggregation of
GO sheets and 0.36 wt % GO + PCL (standard experiment) is observed
in Figure 3a,b, respectively.
GO and 0.36 wt % GO + PCL with concentrations of 0.33 and 8.0 mg mL–1, respectively, only dispersed well in DMF 3 days
after sonication. On the other hand, 0.36 wt % fGO/PCL with concentration
as high as 8.0 mg mL–1 presented outstanding dispersion
performance in Figure 3c, where well-dispersed homogeneous dispersion was observed 3 days
after sonication in more organic solvents, including the one with
low boiling point such as acetone, chloroform, and THF. This experimental
test agreed well with the enlarged interlayer spacing in the optimized
fGO from theoretical results in Section 2.2. At the same time, optical images reveal
the full distribution from fGO/PCL nanocomposites and poor distribution
from 0.36 wt % GO + PCL in Figure 4.

PCL), (b) 0.19 wt % fGO/PCL and (c) 0.36 wt % fGO/PCL nanocomposite
samples with magnification of 1000.

Besides visual inspection, UV–visible absorption (UV–vis)
spectroscopy was employed to gain further insight into the capability
of fGO/PCL nanocomposites to disperse in organic solvents. The UV–vis
spectra were obtained under identical conditions (i.e., all samples
were obtained after immediate sonication in DMF) and diluted to obtain
absorbance value less than one. As presented in Figure 5, a peak at around 270 nm (red arrow) and
a shoulder at ∼300 nm were observed in the GO spectrum, which
might corresponding to π → π* transitions of aromatic
C–C bonds and n → π* transitions of C=O
bonds, respectively.18 PCL shows characteristic
peaks similar to that of 1-NM, in the wavelength region shorter than
300 nm and a shoulder at ∼300 nm, which attributed to the n
→ π* transition of ester carbonyl and showed negligible
change on irradiation.19 The standard experiments,
0.36 wt % GO + PCL and 0.48 wt % fGO/PCL (w/o 1-NM), showed the spectrum
similar to that of GO. This indicates the minor attachment of PCL
on the surface of GO, whereas fGO/PCL nanocomposites show absorption
curves with feature characteristics for both PCL and GO, indicating
their exfoliated structure besides well-dispersed in DMF.

and standard experiments, 0.36 wt % GO + PCL and 0.48 wt % fGO/PCL
(w/o 1-NM) in DMF. The spectra were recorded for immediate dispersions
after 2 h of bath ultrasonication.

2.4 Characterization of fGO/PCL Nanocomposites
The surface morphology of GO, PCL, and fGO/PCL nanocomposites was
studied to consider the distribution and dispersion deeply. Figure 6a,b illustrates the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of GO and plain PCL, respectively.
Wrinkle surface was observed on GO, whereas smooth and homogeneous
surface was observed on fractured PCL. From Figure 6c, a rougher surface compared to plain PCL
and without visible aggregation can be observed. It indicates that
GO sheets are finely dispersed in the PCL matrix and delamination
of GO sheets was effectively induced to yield an exfoliated fGO/PCL
nanocomposites. This agreed well with an optical image of 0.36 wt
% fGO/PCL in Figure 4c.

Figure 6 SEM images for (a) GO and fractured structure for (b) PCL and (c)
0.36 wt % fGO/PCL.

The solid-state structure
of composite was analyzed by the wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (WAXD) pattern, as shown in Figure S2. GO shows a large and broad diffraction peak at
about 2θ = 10.89° with the d-spacing 8.12
Å, corresponding to the layered structure of GO.7 Meanwhile, fGO/PCL nanocomposites showed a typical WAXD
pattern of PCL, whereas the peak corresponding to the layered structure
of GO was not observed. In results, an exfoliated structure was observed,
where the individual GO layers were delaminated and randomly dispersed
in the PCL matrix; the distances between the GO layers were too far
and the layered were too disordered to give a coherent wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (XRD) signal at 2θ = 2°.12

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements were
carried out
to investigate the interactions between GO and PCL, as displayed in Figure S3. A broad band ranged from 3000 to 3700
cm–1 indicated the presence of hydroxy groups on
GO. The peak at 1640 cm–1 was associated with the
skeletal vibrations of aromatic C=C bond or intramolecular
hydrogen bonds. Other bands at 1100, 1090, and 1050 cm–1 correspond to C–O–H deformation, C–H stretching
(epoxy groups), and C–O stretching vibrations (alkoxy groups),
respectively.20 The FTIR spectrum of the
fGO/PCL nanocomposite was agreed well with that of PCL, where 2950–2860
cm–1 indicated C–H hydroxy group stretching;
1700 cm–1 indicated −C=O ester carbonyl
group stretching; 1240–1178 cm–1 indicated
C–O–C stretching.21 The noncovalent
interactions between GO and PCL chains proven by the presence of hydroxy
groups in PCL and fGO/PCL nanocomposite. The peaks of GO were masked
by the peaks of PCL because of relatively less content of GO.

Figure S4 and Table 3 represent the thermal stability of all samples
that analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA curve of
GO showed two major weight losses. The first weight loss step was
started at about 100 °C because of vaporization of water on GO
sheets, whereas the second weight loss step was started at approximately
200 °C because of decomposition of oxygen containing functional
groups (i.e., C=O, C–O–C, and −OH).22 The characteristic degradable temperature of
PCL was about 120 °C. In general, fGO/PCL nanocomposites showed
slightly improved thermal stability as compared to PCL according to
the temperature at the 50 and 10% weight losses that stated in Table 3. This result revealed
that there was no significant interactions such as covalent interactions
among GO and PCL. It complied with the proposed interaction which
was noncovalent interactions.

b Tc is
the crystallization temperature, Tm is
the melting temperature, and ΔHm is the enthalpy of fusion, which are obtained from DSC curves (Figure S5).

Figure S5 and Table 3 show the results from differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) curves and detailed thermal parameters of all samples.
From Figure S5a, neat PCL showed a wide
crystallization peak with a crystallization temperature (Tc) of 29.4 °C. The crystallization peak narrowed
and Tc increased moderately upon the incorporation
of GO. However, melting temperature (Tm) and enthalpy of fusion (ΔHm)
of fGO/PCL nanocomposites decreased as compared to neat PCL, which
indicated that enhancement in crystallization did not occur. In result,
degree of crystallinity reduced. This might be due to low volume fraction
of GO in PCL matrix that resulted less surface nucleation sites.23 From the value of ΔHm, the degree of crystallinity (Xc) can be calculated from the following equation  where ΔHm° is
the fusion
enthalpy of pure crystalline PCL with the value of 136 J/g.24

2.5 Dispersibility
of fGO/PCL Nanocomposites in
Polymer Matrixes
In order to envision the potential of fGO/PCL
nanocomposites in electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries
by utilizing its improved dispersion properties in polymer matrixes
and GOs intrinsic exceptional thermal conductivity, two types of biodegradable
polymer-based green polymer composites were prepared. The chosen commercialized
biodegradable polymers were PCL and poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyric
acid] (PHB). Thermal conductivity was studied in two directions, which
were cross-plane (φc) and in-plane (φi), as shown in Table 4. In cross-plane direction, the obtained thermal conductivities of
commercialized PCL and PHB were 0.21 and 0.20 W/m·K, respectively,
whereas in in-plane direction, 0.29 and 0.37 W/m·K were gained
for commercialized PCL and PHB, respectively.

In general,
PCL-based green polymer composite (0.37 wt % fGO/PCL*)-PCL
showed more satisfying thermal conductivity enhancement in both direction
as compared to that of PHB-based green polymer composite (0.37 wt
% fGO/PCL*)-PHB. This was believed due to better dispersion of fGO/PCL*
nanocomposite in the PCL matrix. Apart from that, there is a noticeable
thermal conductivity enhancement in in-plane for both green polymer
composites. In-plane thermal conductivity enhancement (72 and 38%)
was revealed for (0.37 wt % fGO/PCL*)-PCL and (0.37 wt % fGO/PCL*)-PHB,
respectively. Figure S6 reveals good dispersion
of intercalated fGO/PCL* nanocomposite in polymer matrices, which
promotes the formation of continuous pathways by improving the direct
contact between each nanocomposite resulted low thermal percolation
threshold in in-plane direction. The cross-plane thermal conductivity
enhancement for (0.37 wt % fGO/PCL*)-PCL and (0.37 wt % fGO/PCL*)-PHB
was 29 and 9%, respectively. The slight enhancement in thermal conductivity
can be explained by weak noncovalent bonding such as van der Waals
force with adjacent unhybridized GO orbitals lying perpendicular to
the plane.25

3 Conclusions
In summary, a facile and novel pseudo-surface modification method,
which is known as in situ intercalation polymerization by demonstrating
ROP with ε-CL with 1-NM as an initiator to prepare an organo-dispersible
GO, was reported. Results from UV–vis spectra, SEC profiles,
and 1H NMR spectra reveal the attachment of aromatic hydrocarbon,
1-NM on an intercalator. fGO/PCL showed excellent dispersion performance
that agreed well with the enlarged interlayer spacing in the optimized
fGO from DFT simulations. To confirm the mechanism of proposed pseudo-surface
modification, standard experiment was prepared by suspending GO with
commercialized PCL in chloroform, which known as GO + PCL. According
to dispersion test, optical images, and UV–vis, an exfoliated
structured organo-dispersible fGO/PCL nanocomposite was successfully
synthesized. Therefore, its greater thermal conductivity enhancement
resulted good distribution in polymer matrixes envisioned the possibility
for the application in electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries
as green electronics. We can conclude that this method paves the way
for the production of dispersible GO in various solvents, and it might
be applicable in anionic ring-opening polymerization by introducing
other monomers to replace ε-CL.

4 Experimental
and Computational Procedures
4.1 Materials
GO prepared
by the modified
Hummer’s method26 was supplied by
GO Advanced Solutions Sdn. Bhd. (Selangor, Malaysia) and was vacuum-dried
before use. The ε-CL (>99%) and 1-NM (>95%) were purchased
from
TCI (Tokyo, Japan) and were used as received. The acetone (>99.5%),
chloroform (>99%), THF (>99.5%), DMSO (>99%), toluene (>99.5%),
ethanol
(>99.5%), hexane (>96%), butanol (>99%), N,N-DMF (>99.5%), and tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate
were purchased
from Wako Pure Chemical (Japan) and were used as received. PCL (Mn = 80 000) and poly [(R)-3-hydroxybutyric
acid] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received.

4.2 Sample Preparation
The polymerization
of ε-CL was carried out via the ROP with the 1-NM or butanol
as initiators to yield PCL (with 1-NM) or PCL (with butanol). The
ROP was catalyzed by tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate. The desired amount
of dry GO (5 mg, 10 mg) and 1-NM (31.64 mg, 0.2 mmol) or butanol (14.82
mg, 0.2 mmol) was suspended in ε-CL (2.97 g, 26 mmol) and 3
mL of N,N-DMF by sonicating for
2 h. Then, the suspension including GO, catalytic amount of tin(II)
2-ethylhexanoate, and ε-CL was transferred to a round bottom
flask and sealed with a three-way cock. The flask was degassed by
three freeze–pump–thawing cycles and sealed under nitrogen
gas conditions. The ROP was carried out at 75 °C for 18 h under
vigorous stirring conditions. The resulting solution was precipitated
with ethanol, and the obtained product which named fGO/PCL nanocomposite
was dried in the vacuum desiccator overnight. The fGO/PCL* nanocomposite
was synthesized by using the ratio of ε-CL to 1-NM equal to
600 and 64 h reaction time.

The weight percentage of GO loading
was calculated by the following equation:  where massGO and massfGO/PCL are the mass of GO and fGO/PCL nanocomposite, respectively.

4.3 Standard Sample Preparation
In order
to confirm the interaction between GO surface and PCL chains, two
standard experiments were conducted. GO + PCL (0.36 wt %) was prepared
by dispersing 0.36 wt % GO and commercialized PCL in DMF via ultrasonication.
On the other hand, 0.48 wt % fGO/PCL (w/o 1-NM) was prepared via ROP
in the presence of 10 mg of GO, 2.97 g of ε-CL, 3 mL of DMF,
catalytic amount of tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate and without 1-NM for
18 h.

4.4 Green Polymer Composite Preparation
Green polymer composites were prepared by suspending 1.2 g of synthesized
0.37 wt % fGO/PCL* and 0.3 g of biodegradable polymers in chloroform
by sonicating for an hour. The chosen polymer matrixes were commercialized
PCL and PHB. After that, the suspension was transferred to a Petri
dish and placed inside fume hood for film formation. Before compression
molding, the film was dried in the vacuum desiccator overnight. At
last, the film was prepared by using a hot-press (IMC-180 °C,
Imoto Machinery Co., Japan) at 65 °C for 2 min under a pressure
of 30 MPa and were labeled as (0.37 wt % fGO/PCL*)-PCL and (0.37 wt
% fGO/PCL*)-PHB.

4.5 Characterizations
The number of average
molecular weight (Mn), weight of average
molecular weight (Mw), and polydispersity
index (Mw/Mn) of PCL and fGO/PCL nanocomposites were measured at 40 °C with
a SEC (EcoSEC HLC-8320GPC, TOSOH, Japan) system that equipped with
a TSKgel Super HM-M linear column and a refractive detector, using
chloroform as an eluent (0.6 mL/min). The molecular mass scale was
calibrated with polystyrene standards. The nanocomposite was dissolved
in chloroform, and the solution was filtered with a 0.45 μm
membrane filter before measurements. EcoSEC-WS software was used to
perform calculations.

1H NMR spectra were run to
determine the attachment of 1-NM on PCL chain in deuterated chloroform
(CDCl3) on a NMR spectrometer (JNM-ECP 500 MHz, JEOL, Japan).

The FTIR spectra were recorded using potassium bromide (KBr) pellets
on a FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet iS10, Thermo Scientific, Japan) with
the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm–1 by
16 scans at a resolution of 4 cm–1. The UV–visible
absorption spectra were recorded on a UV–vis spectrometer (USB
4000, Ocean Optics, Japan) at room temperature. The WAXD measurements
were performed using an X-ray diffractometer (MiniFlex 600, Rigaku
Co., Japan) at 40 kV and 15 mA at room temperature. Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.54 Å) was used as the X-ray source. The diffraction
angle was scanned from 3° to 70° at a rate of 10°/min.

The thermal properties of PCL and the nanocomposites were characterized
by TGA and DSC. TGA was carried out on EXSTAR TG/DTA 6200 (SII Nanotechnology
Inc., Japan). The samples were scanned from to 550 °C with the
heating rate of 10 °C/min in the protection of nitrogen flow
of 100 mL/min. DSC was carried out with EXSTAR DSC 6220 (SII Nanotechnology
Inc., Japan). The samples were analyzed in a heat-cool-heat made with
the rate of 10 °C/min. Temperature scan was performed in the
range of 0–100 °C in a continuous nitrogen flow.

Surface morphologies of PCL and fGO/CPL nanocomposites were observed
by a SEM (JCM-6000, JEOL, Japan). The composites samples were prepared
by coating with carbon prior to SEM observation. The distribution
of GO in matrix was evaluated by an optical microscope (VH-Z500, KEYENCE,
Japan) at room temperature.

The cross-plane and in-plane thermal
conductivities of polymer
composites were measured at room temperature using Hioki Heat Flow
Logger LR8432 by the steady-state method.27 For these measurements, hot-pressed samples with 2 cm × 2 cm
and 2 cm × 3 cm were prepared for cross-plane and in-plane thermal
conductivity measurements, respectively. The degree of enhancement
of thermal conductivity of polymer composite known as thermal conductivity
enhancement can be defined as below  where kcom and kpoly represent the thermal conductivity of polymer
composite and pristine polymer matrix, respectively.

4.6 Computational Models
In this work,
all molecular models were built by using the 3D atomistic tool from
Material Studio 6.0. One repeat unit of ring-opened ε-CL that
covalently bonded with 1-NM was selected as a polymer material. The
polymer dimensions were set as 1 nm × 1 nm, as shown in Figure 7a. A bilayer GO simulation
cell (Figure 7b) with
150 atoms was created with slab dimensions of 2 × 2 × 2
nm and angles α = β = γ = 90°. The interlayer
spacing of GO sheets was 1.1 nm. GO sheets were formed using the hydroxy
and epoxide groups that randomly decorated the graphene surfaces.28 Carboxylic acid performed this function at the
edges of the graphene sheets.28 fGO simulation
cell (Figure 7c) with
190 atoms was created with slab dimensions of 2 × 2 × 2
nm and angles α = β = γ = 90°.

material; side view of (a) bilayer GO and
(c) fGO. Each sphere represents an atom using the following color
rule: white, hydrogen; red, oxygen; and gray, carbon.

4.7 Simulation Details
DFT calculations
were performed to optimize the structure of models using the DMol3 module implemented in the Materials Studio 6.0 software package.29 The PW91 version of the general gradient approximation
was combined with a double numerical basis set with d polarization (DND) in the calculations. Values of 0.002 Ha for total
energy, 0.02 Ha Å–1 for force, 0.05 Å
for displacement, and 1 × 10–5 Ha for the self-consistent
field (SCF) computation criterion were chosen to optimize the structures.
The direct inversion of the iterative subspace with a subspace size
of 10 was used to increase the speed of SCF convergence in these systems.
In addition, thermal smearing of the orbital occupation with a smearing
of 0.3 Ha was used to increase the speed of SCF convergence in these
systems. These parameters have been successfully used to optimize
the geometry of the investigated structures.
