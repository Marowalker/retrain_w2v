Two
kinds of layered double hydroxide (LDH) Langmuir composite
films containing azobenzene (Azo) groups were successfully prepared
by Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technology. Then, an X-ray diffractometer
(XRD), a transmission electron microscope (TEM), and an atomic force
microscope (AFM) were used to investigate the structures of NiFe-LDH
and the uniform morphologies of the composite LB films. The photoisomerization
and acid–base gas sensor performances of the obtained thin
film samples were tested by infrared visible (FTIR) spectroscropy
and ultraviolet visible (UV–vis) spectroscropy. It is proved
that the Azo dye molecules in the composite film are relatively stable
to photoisomerization. In addition, the prepared composite films have
high sensing sensitivity and good recyclability for acid–base
response gases. The present research proposes a new clue for designing
thin film materials for chemical gas response with good stability
and sensitivity.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In recent years, the rational
design of various functionalized
layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanocomposites has received increasing
attention from researchers. To fully demonstrate the diverse applications
of LDH materials, the surface can be functionalized.1−3 LDH is widely used in catalytic materials, hydrogels, polymeric
films, and other fields because of the two-dimensional configuration,
indicating that it has good processability and practicality for nanomaterials.4−8 According to reports, Wang et al. developed a self-assembled cross-linked
LDH-doped nanocomposite hydrogel with excellent mechanical properties.9 On the other hand, after the surface of LDH is
modified, it can effectively combine with dye molecules to form polymers
with gas selectivity. For example, it has been reported that the lanthanide
cation was inserted into the LDH layer, and its potential applications
in materials such as biomedical sensing and optoelectronic devices
were studied.10 It is worth noting that
after the LDH layers are peeled into a positively charged nanosheet
layer, an assembly unit is obtained for thin film materials.11−14 Therefore, use of LDH units to build multilayer thin film materials
seems to be an interesting challenge.

Azobenzene (Azo) dye molecules
have been invented in1836. The color
richness and photochromism of these compounds have attracted widespread
interest.15,16 They belongs to a class of organic dye molecules
containing a N=N azo double bond structure. In the past 10
years, azo cross-linked materials have attracted significant attention,
because such materials are expected to be applied in the fields of
microdynamics, photoelectronics, photonics, and optical signal processing.17−21 Azo-type materials can undergo trans–cis isomerization under
appropriate lamp irradiation. As a photosensitive reaction material,
it has been extensively studied, and this characteristic is also the
most significant.22 It has been mentioned
in existing articles that this photoisomerization of Azo and its derivatives,
as well as many other physical and chemical properties, originates
from the nonlocality of π electrons. The trans–cis isomerization
process for can be completed by either the π–π*
energy level or the n−π* energy level.23 In addition, there is a statement that azobenzene dyes
form modified materials with polymers through doping or cross-linking.
This material has a large optical nonlinear coefficient and is widely
studied and applied in the fields of optoelectronics.24−27 Other research teams have studied and characterized the inclusion
formation of Azo compounds and β-cyclodextrin at the air–water
interface.28 Due to the photoisomerization
of Azo dyes, their arrangement in polymers and a series of phenomena
caused by photoisomerization have become the focus of research in
recent years.

The present work uses Langmuir–Blodgett
(LB) technology
to effectively self-assemble the modified nickel–iron LDH (NiFe-LDH)
sheet and azobenzene (Azo) compounds for synthesizing a large-scale
interface with dense and uniform composite materials.29 Interestingly, the obtained composite thin film materials
will be particularly advantageous due to their excellent molecular
recognition capabilities and modest self-assembled models. The results
demonstrate that the reason for the formation of the current composite
Langmuir films is hydrogen bonds and static electricity synergistic
interaction between the groups used to modify NiFe-LDH and the soluble
small molecules or polymer molecules containing Azo.30 In addition, Langmuir films obtained by LB assembly technology
can be easily transferred to solid substrates for characterization
using morphological and spectral methods. Finally, these composite
films were tested for photoisomerization stability and acid–base
gas induction. The obtained results show that compared with the original
sample solutions, after combining NiFe-LDH and azo dye into LB films,
the composite films have reduced light sensitivity while the internal
structures are not easily changed. NiFe-LDH plays a role in stably
blocking ultraviolet light. In addition, the prepared composite films
have high sensing sensitivity and good recyclability for acid–base
response gases. Therefore, the prepared composite materials provide
important application prospects for the design of nano-optical devices
and biochemical sensors.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Characterization of Langmuir
Films
First, the self-assembly and characteristic test scheme
of the NiFe-LDH composite Langmuir film was simply plotted. The initially
prepared NiFe-LDH showed a hexagonal shape under the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), and it was replaced by a gray hexagonal
sheet in this process. Through the LB system, NiFe-LDH was transferred
to the surface of the subphase molecules using a microsyringe to fully
disperse and react and then forming NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo and NiFe-LDH/N-Azo
Langmuir film, respectively. Subsequently, the film was transferred
to different substrates. On the one hand, it was used to carry out
the photoisomerization reaction by UV lamp irradiation. On the other
hand, after the prepared composite film was exposed to the acid or
base gas continuously, a cyclic acid–base response occurred.
These characteristics indicate that the self-assembled LB composite
films have good optical stability and gas sensitivity. It opens up
new ideas for future research on optical switches, optical signal
processors, chemical gas induction film materials, and other self-assembled
nanocomposites (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Scheme and characteristic tests of the preparation process of interfacial
self-assembly of NiFe-LDH composite Langmuir films.

To more conveniently select a reasonably quantitative diffusion
solution volume and subphase solution, the surface pressure–spread
area isothermal curves (π–A) of the
self-assembled Langmuir composite films were demonstrated using the
LB system. Prior to this, the polarity of the NiFe-LDH dispersion
should be adjusted. The volume ratio of methanol/water = 1/1 is the
most suitable dissolution ratio. As shown in Figure 2a, when N-Azo was selected as a single stationary
subphase, the diffusion volume of the NiFe-LDH dispersion was changed
(150, 250, and 350 μL), and three curves were obtained. It is
obvious that the red curve has the highest initiation pressure and
the largest collapse pressure that can be achieved. Figure 2b shows the same results as Figure 2a. Therefore, 250
μL of the diffusion solution was selected for subsequent LB
film preparation. Next, Figure 2c is based on the selection of Figure 2a,b, and the dispersion is diffused to the
surface of three different subphase solutions (pure aqueous solution, p-aminoazobenzene (N-Azo) solution, and polyacrylic acid-azobenzene
(PAA-Azo) solution). It can be clearly seen that as the compression
progresses, the curve is initially stable. At the trough area of about
60 cm2, the isotherm gradually begins to show an upward
trend. The curve starts very late in the pure water subphase solution,
and the collapse pressure finally reached is very low, only 4 mN/m.
This may be because of the fact that the polarity of the dispersion
is similar to that of water. As the spreading diffusion time increases,
some of it dissolves and the other sinks into the bottom of the aqueous
solution, which is not conducive to the formation of the Langmuir
film.31,32 Therefore, in this research, we will not
perform much analysis on the pure water subphase composite film. When
N-Azo is used as a subphase solution, the surface pressure gradually
increases at a trough area of 62 cm2 and the final pressure
increases to 19 mN/m. When the subphase is PAA-Azo, the surface pressure
starts to increase when the trough area is also squeezed to about
62 cm2. The difference is that the increase in speed is
relatively slow, and the maximum pressure it can reach is 14 mN/m.
The different changes of the π–A isotherm
indicate that there are different interface interactions between the
sulfate group in NiFe-LDH and the N-Azo or PAA-Azo molecules, which
led to the formation of LB composite films.

Langmuir films: (a) N-Azo subphase,
different volume dispersion; (b) PAA-Azo subphase, different volume
dispersion; (c) different subphases (methanol/water (v/v) of 1:1,
volume of 250 μL, concentration of 0.7 mg/mL).

To express the nanolevel morphology of the NiFe-LDH composite
Langmuir
film more clearly, a preliminary observation of the film was performed
using a transmission electron microscope, as shown in Figure 3. First of all, it can be seen
in Figure 3a that the
pure NiFe-LDH hexagonal sheet structure is monodispersed with a size
range of 50–150 nm. Compared with NiFe-LDH sheets (Figure 3a), NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo
(Figure 3b) and NiFe-LDH/N-Azo
(Figure 3c) films show
a wide range of cross-linked aggregates at the interface. Furthermore,
atomic force microscopy (AFM) was also used to further investigate
the surface of the single-layer Langmuir film, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the disordered and
irregular state of NiFe-LDH lamellae, whereas Figure 4b,c show uniform and dense NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo
and NiFe-LDH/N-Azo composite films. In particular, it is clearly seen
in Figure 4b that the
NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo composite film has a uniform network-like region
with uniform voids due to the surface extrusion of the LB system.
A number of NiFe-LDH small-sized particles adhere to the inside of
the void structure, forming small and uniform aggregates. Moreover,
in Figure 4c, the NiFe-LDH/N-Azo
composite film with a more minute size of voids and aggregates can
be observed. In comparison, the network structure formed in the NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo
film may be the long alkyl chain of PAA introduced into the composite
film.28,33 These images also correspond to the composite
film aggregates described in the TEM image. The Ra of the thin film in Figure 4b,c is 0.364 and 0.892 nm, respectively.
These results are sufficient to indicate that the surface roughness
of the films is small. Accordingly, these composite films exhibit
different microscopic morphologies, which further illustrates that
the Langmuir composite film can make NiFe-LDH sheets appear uniform
and dense at the interface after being prepared. At the same time,
there are some intermolecular forces between NiFe-LDH and PAA-Azo
or N-Azo molecules, and different manifestations of azobenzene molecules
have different mechanisms of action.

Figure 5 depicts
the characterization of the prepared NiFe-LDH, PAA-Azo, and two LB
multilayer composite films using an X-ray diffractometer, and the
configurations of these materials are analyzed. Corresponding to the
existing literature, after the surface of PAA was modified with azobenzene,
it could be clearly seen that the initial strong diffraction peak
at 2θ = 19.7° and the weak broad diffraction peak at 2θ
= 37.2° respectively shifted to 23.5 and 43.1°.28 From the Bragg equation 2d sin θ
= nλ (λ = 1.54 Å), the angle of
the diffraction peak is inversely proportional to the crystal plane
spacing.34 Therefore, the results indicated
that the interlayer distance of molecules was reduced to some extent
after the introduction of the Azo group. NiFe-LDH has a unique symbolic
diffraction peak at 11.3°, and the diffraction crystal plane
is (003), which proves that NiFe-LDH is successfully synthesized.
Comparing the peaks of the NiFe-LDH/N-Azo and NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo composite
films, the peak of the (003) crystal plane almost disappeared, and
the diffraction peaks between 2θ = 30 and 70° still exist
and are sharp. This shows that NiFe-LDH does exist in the formed composite
films,35 and the interlayer distance after
the formation of film has increased, which further proves that a uniform
and dense void film has been observed in the atomic force image and
also fully illustrates that the composite films are successfully synthesized.

PAA, PAA-Azo, NiFe-LDH, NiFe-LDH/N-Azo LB film, and NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo
LB film.

Because the azo-phenyl group has
a distinct characteristic absorption
peak in the UV–vis spectrum, Figure 6a,b displays the spectra of the pure NiFe-LDH
solution, the two original solutions, and the prepared composite films.
The mechanism of interaction between azobenzene-containing substances
and NiFe-LDH was further studied. From Figure 6a, it can be seen that the (trans isomer)
π–π* transfer characteristic peak of the Azo group
inside PAA-Azo is originally at 339 nm. After interacting with NiFe-LDH,
the peak position shifted toward right to 354 nm. Similarly, in the
NiFe-LDH/N-Azo composite film spectrum (Figure 6b), the assignment of the azo peak shifted
toward right from 374 to 400 nm. Both types of composite films exhibited
a red shift in the UV–vis spectra, which explains that the
J-aggregates occurred between the conjugated Azo group and NiFe-LDH.36

LB films
(b).

For a further study of the interaction
of NiFe-LDH with the azobenzene
molecules in the subphase solution, the Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra of the two LB composite films were characterized as
shown in Figure 7.
The band in the range of 3500–3200 cm–1 is
ascribed to the stretching vibration of the intermolecular hydrogen
bond O–H, which corresponds to 3425 cm–1 in
the NiFe-LDH spectrum. At 1360 and 1630 cm–1, the
symmetrical and antisymmetric bending vibration absorption peaks of
the S=O bond are present.37 In Figure 7a, the NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo
infrared spectrum curve shows two peaks near 2925 and 2849 cm–1, which represent the C–H bond stretching vibration
peaks of −CH2 and −CH3. The peaks
at 1635 and 1506 cm–1 are characteristic absorption
peaks of the C=C skeleton of the benzene ring. The nitrogen–nitrogen
double bond (N=N) characteristic stretching vibration peak
is affected by the benzene ring, and the absorption peak appears at
1642 cm–1. Similarly, the NiFe-LDH/N-Azo composite
film shown in Figure 7b also exhibits specific peak wavelengths of the above-mentioned
groups. These results further illustrate that the positively charged
azo groups in PAA-Azo and N-Azo molecules can undergo hydrogen bonding
and electrostatic interaction with the sulfonic acid group of NiFe-LDH,
thereby changing the wavelength position of the N–H bond. It
can be clearly seen in Figure 7a,b that the composite films also show the partial vibration
absorption peak of the S=O bond, the benzene ring in the original
material, and the vibration band of N=N. In summary, supramolecular
self-assembly has been occurred between the azobenzene molecules and
NiFe-LDH in the composite films.

2.2 Photoisomerization
Analysis
Two kinds
of subphases and their composite LB films were irradiated with a wavelength
of 365 nm using an UV lamp in a dark environment, and the photoisomerization
characteristics of the composite films were studied. For the PAA-Azo
solution in Figure 8a, the characteristic peak of the π–π* transfer
of the trans isomer at 341 nm rapidly decreased after 5 s of UV lamp
irradiation. With an increase in the irradiation time, the peak position
gradually blue-shifted and the absorption intensity decreased slowly
and finally maintained at 328 nm. An intermediate with a certain degree
of stability was produced in the process, and its formation was slow
in the initial stage.23 At the same time,
a slightly enhanced peak at 438 nm represents the n−π
* shift in cis isomerism. The reason for a red shift in the characteristic
peak position with a decrease in the peak intensity may be the different
contents of intermediates, the breaking of the N=N bond of
some molecules, or the intermolecular and molecular–solvent
interactions. After cumulative irradiation for 60–120 s, the
curves do not change any more, indicating that the state of the cis
group in the solution tends to be stable and saturated. At this time,
there are both trans and cis isomers in the solution.

Figure 8 Changes in UV spectra
of PAA-Azo (a), N-Azo solutions (c) and two
LB films (b, d) under UV lamp irradiation.

The UV spectra of NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo composite LB films under UV
lamp irradiation are shown in Figure 8b. The peak at 351 nm had a significant downward trend
when UV irradiation was performed for 20 s, and it remained almost
unchanged after the irradiation time increased to 240 s. It shows
that after PAA-Azo is combined to a composite film, the structure
becomes more stable than before. The peak intensity does not change
in a short time, which indicates that the trans–cis isomer
of azobenzene reaches equilibrium. For the composite films of polarized
NiFe-LDH and N-Azo (Figure 8d), the spectrum basically changed little after 5 min of light
irradiation. The spectral intensity changes of the two composite films
after light irradiation were relatively weak, which might be due to
the better stability of the polarization film. In addition, the light
stability of these films has been improved. At the same time, it is
also reasonable that the azo groups recombine to form J-type aggregates
on the surface of the NiFe-LDH sheet, and a certain steric hindrance
occurs, which prevents the trans–cis isomerization process
from occurring.28,30 This phenomenon also coincides
with the multiple characterization structures described earlier.

2.3 Acid–Base Gas Response Analysis
After exploring the light stability of the LB composite films, related
acid–base gas induction tests were also performed. The changes
in the characteristic peak positions of two different subphase NiFe-LDH
composite films were analyzed in detail by UV–vis spectra. Figure 9a,b respectively
shows the UV spectrum after 2 min of HCl gas and NH3 gas
treatment for NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo and NiFe-LDH/N-Azo multilayer LB composite
films. The pictures below the spectra correspond to the color contrast
of the composite films before and after the acid–base gas atmosphere.
Through observation and comparison, it was found that the two LB films
were more sensitive to changes in the acid–base atmosphere.
When the acid–base atmosphere changes, the original absorption
peak corresponding to the film in the spectrum is red-shifted or blue-shifted.38 It can be seen from Figure 9a that after contacting the HCl gas, the
original peak of the NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo film at about 351 nm was red-shifted
by 10 nm. After full contact with NH3 gas, the peak position
returned to the vicinity of 351 nm. Similar to Figure 9a, after the HCl gas treatment, the position
of the NiFe-LDH/N-Azo film peak in Figure 9b was also red-shifted by 29 nm. After the
NH3 treatment, the peak returned to almost the same position
as the original position. At the same time, the initial color of the
NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo film is light brown to nearly transparent. Under
a certain concentration of HCl gas, the color changes to orange-brown,
and then under a certain concentration of NH3 gas, the
film gradually returns to its original color. The color of the NiFe-LDH/N-Azo
film changes from the original light brown to reddish brown and finally
converts back to light brown. It is worth noting that these changes
occur very quickly and the color changes of films are very sensitive.
These changes can be assigned to the presence of heteroatoms (such
as N atoms) in the subphase solvents and film material structures
with the changes in the external acid–base atmosphere.30,37 As a result, the internal structure of the composite film changes,
which affects the charge transfer.39 That
is, when the acidic gas contacts the thin films, the acidic medium
undergoes a protonation reaction with the positively charged −NH2 group in the film structure and then a deprotonation reaction
occurs after contacting with the alkaline gas. The above conclusions
showed that the dense and uniform composite films prepared by LB technology
had acid–base discoloration properties, and the film materials
have a high sensitivity for acid–base gas sensors.40−48

spectra and photos of the NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo (a) and NiFe-LDH/N-Azo
LB films (b) exposed to HCl and NH3 gases (photos, from
left to right, represent the original composite film, the film exposed
to HCl, and next exposed to NH3 gas, respectively).

Finally, to facilitate the reuse of the LB composite
films, after
each contact with HCl and NH3 gas, the films were soaked
or rinsed with ultrapure water, and then the byproducts on the surface
can be removed. Afterward, the next acid–base treatment can
be performed again. After multiple cycles, combined with each measurement
of the UV–vis spectrum data, the results after six cycles of
two different LB composite films are shown in Figure 10. The ordinate shows the ratio of the ultraviolet
maximum absorption intensities. Here, I0 represents the maximum ultraviolet absorbance of the composite films
in the initial state and In represents the maximum ultraviolet absorbance of the composite
films after n cycles. The analysis results show that
after six cycles of reaction, the UV intensity ratio is maintained
at about 95%. Additionally, it shows that the prepared LB films have
good recyclability, which also confirms that the prepared LB film
materials have broad application prospects.49−57

3 Conclusions
In summary, new ordered NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo and NiFe-LDH/N-Azo self-assembled
composite films were successfully prepared by LB technology. In the
LB composite film, the positively charged NiFe-LDH sheets can induce
the subphase azo molecules to form J-type aggregates, thereby producing
nanoscale uniform films with different morphologies. The characteristics
of the LB composite films have also been characterized by various
tests. The photoisomerization characteristics and acid–base
gas response characteristics of the composite films were studied by
UV–vis spectra. Under the UV light irradiation, the ultraviolet
spectra of the two azobenzene solutions change significantly, whereas
the two composite films change slowly or even unchanged. The above
phenomenon is due to the NiFe-LDH and the azo groups on the LDH sheet
surface forming an ordered stacked J-type aggregate with sterile hindrance,
which hinders the trans–cis isomerization conversion. When
the composite films were repeatedly cycled in the atmosphere of HCl
and NH3, the −NH2 groups in LB films
underwent a sensitive discoloration phenomenon (protonation and deprotonation)
due to the change of acid–base atmosphere and the obtained
composite films exhibited good recyclability. Therefore, the NiFe-LDH/PAA-Azo
and NiFe-LDH/N-Azo composite films can be used as functional materials
for light response and a gas sensor. The current work provides useful
clues for the acid–base discoloration in self-assembled LB
films and opens up new ideas for the study of photoresponsive materials
and chemical gas sensor composites.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
FeSO4·9H2O (≥99.5 wt %), NiSO4·6H2O (≥98.5 wt %), methanol (CH3OH), and ethanol (C2H5OH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd. CO(NH2)2 and NH4F were
purchased from Qinhuangdao Reagent Factory of Hebei, China, and were
of analytical reagent grade. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt %) and
ammonia (NH3·H2O, 25 wt %) were obtained
from Tianjin Kaitong Industrial Chemical Reagent Company. 4-Aminoazobenzene
(N-Azo) was purchased from Tianjin Alfa Aesar Chemical Reagent Factory.
Polyacrylic acid (PAA; average molecular weight, 450 000) was
purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Reagent Chemical Company. Polyacrylic
acid azo derivative (PAA-Azo) was prepared according to the previous
method. The experimental water was ultrapure water purified by the
Milli-Q Plus system.

4.2 Preparation of NiFe-LDH
The route
for the synthesis of raw materials was referred from a relative report.58 Experimental conditions were adjusted to ensure
operation under the proper conditions in this work. Under continuous
stirring, 3.6 mmol of NiSO4·6H2O and 1.8
mmol of FeSO4·9H2O were dissolved in 50
mL of ultrapure water, and then 126 mmol of CO (NH2)2 and 20 mmol of NH4F were added after 15 min. After
the solid powder was sufficiently dissolved, the mixed solution was
transferred to a 100 mL sealed autoclave, hydrothermally treated at
180 °C for 12 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The black
product was centrifuged and washed with repeated alcohol and water
procedures until neutral conditions. The finally obtained composite
was freeze-dried at −50 °C.

4.3 Preparation
of NiFe-LDH Langmuir Films
Before preparing the Langmuir
films, it is necessary to thoroughly
clean the LB trough with methanol and ultrapure water, and the diffusion
solution (0.7 mg/mL, NiFe-LDH) is prepared in advance. The first step
is to fill the trough with a subphase solution (three subphases are
used here: ultrapure water, PAA-Azo, and N-Azo solutions with a concentration
of 50 mg/L). The second step is to spread the prepared diffusion solution
dropwise on the surface of the subphase solution with a microsyringe.
Subsequently, after the methanol solvent evaporates for 20–25
min, the surface solvent and subphase solution fully interact to form
a thin dense layer. Then, the film is transferred to different substrates
under appropriate pressure, and the single-layer and multilayer LB
films were finally obtained.

4.4 Photoisomerism and Gas
Response Experiments
First, multilayer (at least 70 layers)
composite LB films were
selected, transferred to a quartz substrate, and irradiated it with
an UV lamp at a wavelength of 365 nm. The changes in the internal
configuration of the composite films were further investigated by
UV–vis spectroscopy. Then, the obtained multilayer (at least
70 layers) composite LB films were exposed to HCl and NH3 atmospheres, respectively. The color changes of the prepared films
were monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy.

4.5 Characterization
The instrument model
used to prepare or transfer the LB films for operation is the KSV-NIMA
system (Purchased from Biolan Technology, Sweden). The microstructure
of the product was depicted using a transmission electron microscope
(TEM, HT7700, High-Technologies Corp., Ibaraki, Japan). Atomic force
microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a silicon cantilever probe
microscope (Veeco Instrument), Nanoscope Model Multimode 8. X-ray
diffraction (XRD, SMART LAB, Rigaku) was used to characterize the
molecular orientation and microstructure of NiFe-LDH and composite
films. To measure the FTIR spectrum using a Thermo Nicolet Corporation
spectrometer, it is necessary to transfer the film layer-by-layer
to the CaF2 substrate in advance. After transferring the
films to a quartz substrate, UV–visible spectroscopy (UV–vis)
can be performed using the Shimadzu UV-2550 system. Photoisomerism
and acid–base gas response phenomena can be characterized by
UV–vis spectroscopy, and color changes can be obtained by taking
a quartz plate with a Nikon (Tokyo) D90 A SLR camera.
