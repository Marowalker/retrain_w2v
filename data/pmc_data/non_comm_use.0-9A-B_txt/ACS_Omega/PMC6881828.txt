Transition-metal-doped carbon catalysts
are promising Pt-free alternatives
for low-temperature fuel cells. They are frequently obtained from
sacrificial N-rich zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) doped with
Co and Fe. The optimal low loading of metals has to be achieved to
guarantee the competitive efficiency and facilitate an inquiry into
the mechanism of their catalytic activity. We report on microwave-assisted
solvothermal synthesis of Zn,Co-ZIFs with a relatively low (1–15
mol %) Co loading, which were further enriched with Fe(II). Materials
were pyrolyzed at 700 °C to form catalytically active carbons
bearing metal nanoparticles confined in structured carbon. The electrochemistry
test of carbons for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in perchloric
acid demonstrated their high efficiency even at low cobalt contents.
The initial loading of 10 mol % was found efficient, leading to the
production of catalytically active carbons allowing for four-electron
path of ORR.

1 Introduction
The
question of new power supplies gains more relevance nowadays
due to the continually increasing demand for energy. Different substitutes
for fossil fuels have been offered so far. Renewable electrochemical
energy sources are among the most promising solutions for consumer-level
power supply products. Low-temperature hydrogen–oxygen fuel
cells appear to be beneficial for mass production as they do not require
special working conditions, the byproducts of operation are harmless,
and several devices may be combined to scale-up the amount of energy
retained.1 The efficiency of proton exchange
membrane fuel cells is profoundly affected by the rate of cathodic
oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The most productive electrocatalysts
for ORR are materials containing precious metals, especially platinum.2,3 High cost and tendency for degradation of Pt-based catalysts hamper
their large-scale commercialization. Hence, nonprecious metal catalysts
(NPMCs) are being developed as an alternative.

Since 1964, when
Jasinski first reported on the catalytic activity
of cobalt phthalocyanine,4 the transition-metal
macrocycles comprising M–N4 (M = Fe or Co) coordination
have been tried as NPMCs. Later, it was found that pyrolysis converts
them into M–N–C materials with enhanced activity and
stability.5 The approach had been extended
to metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), either as-prepared or postsynthetically
functionalized, who became sacrificial precursors for active porous
carbons.6 Carbonization of MOF containing
carbon, nitrogen, and metal ensured simultaneous formation of catalytically
active centers and a carbonaceous support. The latter depending on
the degree of graphitization may provide good electrical conductivity7 and can enhance catalytic activity of supported
metals via the synergistic effect.8

The most studied NPMCs are those with iron and cobalt catalytic
sites.8−13 Compelling results have been reported for NPMCs obtained from Co-based
MOFs.14−16 The particular configuration of cobalt sites may
affect ORR by increasing17 or reducing18 the likelihood of H2O2 formation. Although the impact of cobalt is considered substantial,14−17 its activity in the presence of iron has been less examined. Thus,
establishing of an efficient minimum amount of cobalt in NPMCs will
have a positive impact on the development of economically reasonable
production of carbon-based ORR catalysts.

Cobalt can naturally
substitute zinc as a coordination center in
zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF). Bimetallic Co,Zn-ZIFs can be
obtained either as a mechanical mixture of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67,19 or synthesized intentionally by wet chemistry
methods.20−25 The density of active sites, porosity and catalytic activity of
the resulting materials are finely controlled by the Co/Zn molar ratio.24,25 Zinc is known to abandon the framework at elevated temperatures,22,23 favoring the formation of porous carbons and exposure of the remaining
Co–N active sites.22,24 The cobalt loading
must be high when only the Co–N site has to be formed in acatalyst.
Its amount can be reasonably reduced if there is also the Fe–N
center to contribute to the catalyst performance.20

Previously, we obtained NPMC for ORR from Co,Zn-ZIF
(Co/Zn = 2:1)
with addition of Fe(II) salt by a three-step synthesis.26 In a subsequent report,27 we performed a systematic study on four Fe,Co,Zn-N/C catalysts,
prepared in the same way with different Co/Zn ratios (1:3, 1:2, 2:1
and 3:1). It was found that the loading ratio of Co/Zn = 2:1 forms
the most active catalyst in a row. Now, the question is, what would
be the minimum level of cobalt loading that results in an efficient
catalyst for ORR? For the present study, we prepared Zn,Co-ZIFs according
to the earlier developed protocol26,27 but with lower
loadings of cobalt, ranging from 1 to 15 mol %. MOFs were further
impregnated with the Fe(II)-phenanthroline complex and pyrolyzed at
700 °C. The morphology, structure, and elemental content of resulting
carbons were analyzed with different experimental techniques. We will
demonstrate that so-obtained NPMCs exhibit an appreciably high catalytic
activity in an acidic medium.

2 Results and Discussion
It is known that cobalt incorporated into the structure of growing
ZIF crystals has less efficiency than zinc. The extent of adsorption
of the Fe(II)-phenanthroline complex on the large surface of MOF is
limited too, leaving aside some unreacted dopant. All of these considerations
justify the need for monitoring of the actual elemental composition
of materials at different stages of preparation (Scheme S1). Such inquiry has been done with the X-ray fluorescence
(XRF) technique for synthesized, impregnated, and carbonized samples.
The results of micro-XRF mapping confirmed the presence of all introduced
metals in the material. The averaged (on different measured points)
values of elemental composition are summarized in Table S1, where samples are designated according to the initial
loading of cobalt. The measured Zn/Co ratio in the samples differs
from that chosen initially, although an overall trend is preserved.
Even with above-mentioned considerations, apparently, there is a systematic
reduction of Co and Fe contents in favor of the heavier Zn because
the XRF counts are collected from a micrometer-size spot and all of
the elements have atomic weight of the same order of magnitude.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (STEM–EDX) mapping allowed obtaining a distinct
picture of element distribution in the resulting carbons. Two sets
of images are presented in Figure 1 for NPMC-Co-1 and NPMC-Co-15 samples (images for NPMC-Co-5
are shown in Figure S1). The TEM image
shows amorphous grains of carbon supporting metal nanoparticles (NPs).
EDX mapping evidences that NPs are made of iron and cobalt. Cobalt
is also distributed across the volume either in the form of small
clusters or in isolated sites on the carbon surface. Zinc is present
in abundance, although the formation of Zn NPs is unlikely at the
adopted conditions of thermal treatment. Nitrogen is richly dispersed
across the material, allowing for the presence of both Co–N
and Fe–N sites in addition to the known diversity of C–N
arrangements.6,13 These maps present the picture
resembling that has been already observed for a similar system in
our earlier reports.27

images for NPMC-Co-1 (column a) and NPMC-Co-15
(column b). The scale bar equals 50 nm.

A further insight into the morphology of pyrolyzed ZIFs was obtained
by high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) imaging. The representative images
at different magnifications (5 and 20 nm scales) are presented in Figure 2 (images at an intermediate
magnification can be seen in Figure S2).
The shape of parent ZIF crystallites cannot be distinguished, and
the samples consist of amorphous carbon. There are many metal NPs;
each is wrapped by about 7–10 continuous graphitic carbon layers
with 0.19 nm spacing corresponding to the ⟨111⟩ plane
of Co. The average size of NPs was found from graphical analysis of
TEM images (particle size distributions are presented in Figure S3). The values are 2.8, 3.9, 3.7, and
4.0 nm for NPMC-Co-1, NPMC-Co-5, NPMC-Co-10, and NPMC-Co-15, respectively.

Figure 2 HR-TEM
images with scale bars of 20 nm (left column) and 5 nm (right
column) for the pyrolyzed samples: NPMC-Co-1 (a), NPMC-Co-5 (b), NPMC-Co-10
(c), and NPMC-Co-15 (d) samples.

Starting from NPMC-Co-5, bamboo-shaped carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
with NPs confined at their ends are evidently present. The oblate
shape of NPs and equidistant confinements constituting the tube are
indicative for the “tip-growth” mode of their formation.30 Such peculiarities have been already observed
by our group in a similar system but having a substantially higher
cobalt content.27 However, in the present
case, CNTs appear shorter and thinner than those observed previously.
The distinction might be ascribed to the difference in the NP’s
composition since the type of metal and the size of the NPs are known
to influence the tube’s length and diameter.31 Recalling EDAX images, we may stress on visibly higher
iron content in NPs, whereas cobalt atoms are evenly distributed.
It is worth noting that nitrogen can also be found in the CNTs’
walls.

Considering the morphology of the resulting carbons (Figure 2), there is no surprise
in
the shape of measured X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Figure 3a, which is immanent
to amorphous carbon (XRD patterns for as-prepared Zn,Co-ZIFs are shown
in Figure S4; they match well with those
in ref (28)). The diffractograms
exhibit strong and large increment at 2θ angles below 40°
and a distinct reflection at 44°. For semiquantitative analysis
of XRD data, the part below 30° was excluded since it mainly
contains the signal from amorphous carbons.32 In the remaining part, a very smooth background was subtracted (see Figure 3a, red dashed line)
and the resulting patterns were plotted (Figure 3b–d, scatters). The remaining peak
at 2θ ∼45° correspond to the (111) reflection of
face-centered cubic (fcc) Co, with a weaker (200) peak at 2θ
∼53°. Therefore, the presence of small fcc Co nanoparticles
is confirmed. The Rietveld refinement of the data was performed in
Jana2006 program33 using a three-parameter
background function (Legendre polynomials) and Gaussian shape of the
peaks with only one variable (GP) since
the instrumental contribution to the peak broadening of such small
nanoparticles could be neglected. Due to the fact that only (111)
reflection was clearly observed, zero shift was fixed to 0 and only
cell parameter was fitted. The fitted data is shown by blue lines
in Figure 3b–d.
The fitted values of cell parameter, a, and grain
size, D, for three samples are summarized in Table S2. The content of Co in ZIF-Co-1 was too
low to observe Co reflections even after background subtraction due
to too low signal-to-noise ratio.

lines), with the example
of the smooth background (dashed red line). (b–d) Background
subtracted experimental data (gray scatters) and theoretical patterns
(solid blue lines).

Raman spectra of the
samples in Figure 4 demonstrate a spectral envelope in the 1200–1700
cm–1 wave number range, which is formed due to the
characteristic bands of a carbonaceous material. We utilized a four-peak
model to deconvolute the envelope with four Lorentzians.34 The obtained components are situated at ca.
1221, 1320, 1439, and 1578 cm–1 (shown for NPMC-Co-1
in Figure 4). The first
component can be attributed to the I line, which is a characteristic
for the structured N-doped carbon, i.e., CNTs. The defects related
to D and D″ lines are situated at 1320 and 1439 cm–1, respectively. All spectra contain a relatively large D″
band, which is caused by the defects disturbing the regular graphite
layer stacking. The intensity ratio of the lattice defects band D
and of the crystalline graphite band G at 1578 cm–1 is the indicative parameter for disorder of the material. This value
is about 0.64 for the samples.

Figure 4 Raman spectra of pyrolyzed samples. Deconvolution
of spectral envelope
is shown for NPMC-Co-1 as an example (gray curves).

The thermal stability of impregnated ZIFs and pyrolyzed NPMCs
was
analyzed. The former was performed in an inert atmosphere, in such
way modeling the pyrolysis itself. Figure 5a shows thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
curves for the samples with initial cobalt loadings of 5 and 15 mol
%. The profile of both curves is classical for the ZIF family, with
the thermal stability threshold of ca. 450 °C. All samples reach
a stable mass at 650 °C; the residual weight is 31.3 for ZIF-Co-5
and 36.7% for ZIF-Co-15. This difference can be reasonably attributed
to the cobalt content since all other elements are expected to abandon
the system equally for both samples.

Figure 5 TGA curves of impregnated hybrid ZIFs
with initial cobalt loadings
of 5 and 15 mol % in a nitrogen flow (a) and of respective pyrolyzed
NPMC materials in an air atmosphere (b).

The resulting NPMCs were exposed to thermal treatment to monitor
their behavior in open air applications. The respective TGA curves
are presented in Figure 5b. TGA curves begin with a rather sharp weight loss of 10–12%
before reaching 140 °C. This decrement can be safely attributed
to the evaporation of the molecules absorbed by samples from the ambient
conditions (e.g., water vapor). Above 350 °C, samples are losing
weight rapidly due to oxidization of carbon and melting of zinc in
flux of air. The residual weight fractions are 24.7% for NPMC-Co-5
and 28.9% for NPMC-Co-15.

Figure 6 shows the
N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of type I (IUPAC) for
as-prepared Zn,Co-ZIFs (Figure 6a) and of type II for pyrolyzed NPMCs (Figure 6b). ZIFs exhibit high values of the specific
surface area (see Table S3), which are
immanent for this type of MOF.29 Samples
contain micropores of 0.7–1.6 nm width (Figure S5), as has been evaluated by nonlocal density functional
theory (NL-DFT). High-temperature treatment obviously leads to a tremendous
reduction in the surface area. Comparing the profiles for NPMCs in Figure 6b and the obtained
values (Table S3), one may find that the
surface area correlates with the amount of cobalt. This might be due
to a known phenomenon that introduction of cobalt into ZIF increases
its thermal stability.

and those
after pyrolysis (b). The filled and hollow circles correspond to adsorption
and desorption branches, respectively.

The catalytic activity of the prepared materials was tested by
cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements
at room temperature in a three-electrode electrochemical cell in 0.1
M HClO4 electrolyte. Figure 7 shows CV curves measured after the 5th and 20th cycles
for all of the samples. The residual Zn2+ ions in the samples
are catalytically inactive and cannot affect the shape of CV curves
and the ORR path.35 The absence of the
peak at 0.77 V indicates the nonavailability of Fe3+/Fe2+ reduction/oxidation processes that are often observed in
similar systems.36 This suggests that most
of the iron is contributed to the formation of Fe–Co NPs. From
the comparison of the CV curves (Figure 7), both NPMC-Co-10 and NPMC-Co-15 demonstrate
a higher ORR activity than the other two with lower cobalt contents.
Taking into account that samples received a similar amount of iron
and nitrogen, such difference in the catalytic activity is clearly
due to cobalt. The variations in the mean size of NPs have to be examined
too. By matching the particle size distributions (Figure S3) with CV curves (Figure 7), the size range of 3.5–4.5 nm appears
optimum for the catalytically active NPs. Accordingly, NPMCs with
smaller (e.g., NPMC-Co-5) and bigger (e.g., NPMC-Co-15) metal NPs
are less active.

Figure 7 CV curves recorded after the 5th (blue) and 20th (red)
cycles in
0.1 M HClO4 solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s–1, t = 25 °C in an O2 atmosphere
with the RDE sweep rate of 1600 rpm for NPMC-Co-1 (a), NPMC-Co-5 (b),
NPMC-Co-10 (c), and NPMC-Co-15 (d).

The characteristic electrochemical parameters of examined samples
are summarized in Table 1, which presents the onset potential after 5th and 20th cycles, the
kinetic current density, ik, calculated from Tafel equation, and the measured current, i, taken at 0.4 V. The highest value of onset potential
was observed for the NPMC-Co-10 and NPMC-Co-15 samples. The values
of onset potential (0.85 V) and i = 4.55 mA cm–2 (at 0.40 V) for NPMC-Co-10 are close to those reported
in the literature. For example, in the work of Lai et al.,37 the Fe–N/C catalyst displays an onset
potential of 0.861 V and i = 5.12 mA cm–2 (at 0.40 V). Huo et al.38 reported the
following onset potentials measured in acidic media: 0.85 V for Fe–N–C,
0.87 V for Meso-Fe–N–C, 0.79 V for N–G, and 0.82
V for Meso-N–C/N–G samples. In comparison, Wei et al.39 observed the onset potential of 0.83 V for Co-Nx/C catalysts in acidic media. Osmieri et al.40 found that the onset potential for Fe–N–C
(0.83 V) exceeds that for Co–N–C (0.79 V). The value
of ik measured at 1600
rpm for NPMC-Co-10, which has been found more active sample, was lower
than reported by others,41 however, higher
than the one measured at 0.7 V for 25% Fe–N/C sample (0.98
mA cm–2) and close to that of 15% Fe–N/C
(3.36 mA cm–2).

Figure 8a presents
the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) curves. The RRDE study indicated
that ORR takes place predominantly through the efficient four-electron
pathway. The calculated peroxide yield is shown in Figure 8b. It exceeds 15% for NPMC-Co-1
only. The higher activity of NPMC-Co-10 can be explained by the lower
quantity of peroxide. The same maximum of the peroxide production
in the region of 0.6–0.65 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode
(RHE) was observed by another group.42 The
number of electrons, n, were also determined from
RDE and RRDE currents using eq 2. It was found that in the potential range of 0.1–0.8
V, the value of n per oxygen molecule varies from
3.8 to 4.1 for all samples.

The calculated exchange current
density decreases according to
the order NPMC-Co-10 (1.6 × 10–8 A cm–2) > NPMC-Co-15 (1.1 × 10–8 A cm–2) > NPMC-Co-5 (9.9 × 10–9 A cm–2) > NPMC-Co-1 (7.9 × 10–9 A cm–2). The values for both NPMC-Co-10 and NPMC-Co-15 are close to 2.4
× 10–8 A cm–2, which was
obtained for the catalyst with a higher content of cobalt,27 whereas the Pt/C catalyst TEC 10E50E of 46 wt
% Pt (Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo Corp.) demonstrated a value of 3.9 ×
10–8 A cm–2.43

The ORR kinetics was investigated using the Koutecky–Levich
plots (Figure S6) according to eq S1.44 The number
of electrons for the prepared materials was calculated at 0.65 V.
The obtained values were 2.5 (for both NPMC-Co-1 and NPMC-Co-5), 3.3
(NPMC-Co-10), and 4.2 (NPMC-Co-15), being in compliance with those
from the RDDE experiment. Based on these findings, we presume preferential
formation of peroxide in ORR catalyzed by materials with low cobalt
contents, whereas, catalysts with higher cobalt concentrations follow
the four-electron path for ORR, demonstrating the higher catalytic
activity.

The origin of the electrochemical activity in NPMC-Co
can be explained
based on the review of Bezerra et al.,12 dedicated to the Fe–N/C and Co–N/C catalysts for ORR.
Summing up the reviewed works, there are two possible catalytic site,
denoted M–N4/C and M–N2/C (M =
Co, Fe), with the latter considered to be more active for ORR. The
pyrolysis at 700 °C forms the M–N4/C moieties
in abundance but is also sufficient to form the M–N2/C moieties, which have both catalytic activity and selectivity toward
the 4e– pathway mechanism to produce water. According
to XRD data (Figure 3), samples demonstrate fcc metal structure, which is typical for
metallic Co. The absence of other peaks indicates that Fe is not in
the metallic state, which has a bcc structure, but can be incorporated
in Fe–Co alloys. Our recent X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies
on a similar system (but with a higher Co content) also showed that
Fe was in Fe0 state and preferentially located at the surface
of mixed Fe–Co NPs, without any evidence of pure Fe NPs.27

The difference in the catalytic activity
observed in the ORR tests
is defined by the amount of cobalt in the catalysts. Such a “single
variative” situation has been purposely set in the study. Zn
is known to have relatively poor conductivity in ORR and significantly
abandons the system at the high-temperature treatment. Both Fe and
N were introduced in equal quantities. Most of the iron contributed
to the formation of metallic NPs. Nitrogen after being incorporated
into ZIF and having experienced the pyrolysis can be expected to form
a similar distribution of N sites (three types are known) in all samples,
contributing equally in the electrochemical activity.

3 Conclusions
Electrocatalytically active carbons were prepared
by a conventional
three-step approach. Hybrid ZIFs with low amounts of cobalt were synthesized
by the solvothermal MW-assisted method and then impregnated with iron(II)
salt. The level of iron doping was the same for all samples but exceeding
that of cobalt in all cases. Pyrolysis at 700 °C of sacrificial
ZIFs transformed them into a mostly amorphous carbonaceous material
supporting metal NPs wrapped in graphite layers or confined in bamboolike
nanotubes. These NPs are mostly of cobalt, with some containing iron
as well. Such situation was already observed by us in a synchrotron-based
study reported elsewhere.43 From the electrochemistry
tests, it was established that the catalytic activity of pyrolyzed
carbons primarily correlates with the amount of cobalt and that the
loading of 10 mol % cobalt in respect to zinc had led to the most
catalytically active material. The comparative analysis of measurements
performed with RDE and RRDE techniques allowed establishing the number
of electrons participating in the ORR reaction as well as the yield
from the side reaction of peroxide formation. Since the cost of cobalt
salt is generally higher than those of zinc and iron, identifying
the lowest optimum loading of cobalt has an economical significance
for scaling-up and sustainable production of Pt-free catalysts for
low-temperature fuel cells.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Synthesis
A three-step synthetic
approach described previously was followed in this work for obtaining
the Co,Zn/Fe/N/C materials (see Scheme S1).26,27 All chemicals were of analytical grade,
purchased from commercial suppliers, and used without further purification.

First, solutions of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, and
2-methylimidazole in dimethyl formamide (DMF) were mixed in a beaker
under a gentle stirring. The cobalt contents were set to 1, 5, 10,
and 15 mol %, and the resulting samples were labeled accordingly as
ZIF-Co-1, ZIF-Co-5, ZIF-Co-10, and ZIF-Co-15. The mixtures were poured
into Green Chem Plus vessels, which were fixed at a carousel of the
microwave accelerated reaction system, MARS 6 (CEM). The synthesis
was performed at 140 °C for 2 h under medium stirring. The resulting
powders were collected by centrifugation and washed with DMF and methanol.
They were also kept in methanol for 24 h to assure the complete removal
of solvent molecules from the pores of the material. The samples were
dried at 80 °C overnight.

Second, samples were impregnated
with the iron(II) acetate and
1,10-phenanthroline complex. Iron(II) salt was taken as 4 wt % MOF
powder, and the molar ratio of components was set to 1:6, respectively.
Initially, the complex was formed in ethanol, and then, the MOF powder
was added. Thereafter, the mixture was subjected to sonication for
30 min and stirred for 1 h. The extracted powder was dried at 80 °C.

Finally, the impregnated samples were calcinated at 700 °C
for 3 h under an Ar flow. The pyrolysis was conducted in a tube furnace
(Nabertherm) with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. After cooling down, the black carbonaceous powder was collected.
To distinguish from the synthesized MOFs, the pyrolyzed samples were
named as NPMC-Co-1, NPMC-Co-5, NPMC-Co-10, and NPMC-Co-15, preserving
the integrity of notation.

4.2 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns were collected using a D2 Phaser (Bruker) X-ray diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation. The elemental analysis was performed on
a M4 TORNADO (Bruker) micro-X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. For high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), a Tecnai G2 F20S-TWIN
(FEI) microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV was
used. The same microscope was employed for elemental analysis by a
combination of scanning TEM with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(STEM–EDX). For the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), a simultaneous
thermal analyzer Jupiter ST449 F5 (Netzsch) was used. Raman spectra
were acquired on a micro-Raman (Renishaw) system with an excitation
line of 535 nm. The surface area were evaluated according to Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and Langmuir models from nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms measured at −196 °C on a sorption station, ASAP
2020 (Micromeritics). The pore width was evaluated by the nonlocal
density functional theory (NL-DFT) method using the instrument’s
software.

4.3 Electrochemical Tests
The electrochemical
experiments were conducted at room temperature using a PARSTAT 4000
potentiostat/galvanostat combined with a standard three-electrode
cell. Silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl, KCl(sat.)) was used as the
reference electrode, and a Pt wire was used as the counter electrode.
The rotating disk electrode was utilized as the working electrode.
The measured potentials were calibrated with reference to the reversible
hydrogen electrode (RHE) vs Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) and were converted
to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the
Nernst equation 1  where EAg/AgCl is the experimentally measured potential vs Ag/AgCl reference and EAg/AgCl0 = 0.197 V at 25 °C.

The values of potential provided along the text are referenced
against RHE unless otherwise stated. The catalytic tests took place
in the acidic medium of 0.1 M HClO4 solution as an electrolyte.
Typically, 5 mg of the catalyst was mixed with 1 mg of carbon (Vulcan
XC-72); the obtained composition was then ultrasonically dispersed
in 900 μL of isopropanol and 100 μL of 0.5% Nafion solution
(DuPont) and intensively stirred to form a homogeneous black ink.
Furthermore, 28 μL of acquired ink was placed onto the surface
of the glassy carbon (0.19625 cm2) of RDE, followed by
drying in the air at room temperature. The catalyst loading was 0.72
mg cm–2 for NPMC-Co-1, 0.64 mg cm–2 for NPMC-Co-5, 0.69 mg cm–2 for NPMC-Co-10, and
0.69 mg cm–2 for NPMC-Co-15.

The rotating
ring-disk electrode current, IR, was measured
with a glassy carbon ring electrode. The four-electron
selectivity of ORR at the catalyst was calculated according to 2  Using the
ring and disk currents (IR and ID, respectively)
