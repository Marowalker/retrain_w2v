Self-assembled
composite adsorbents that combine the controllability
of self-assembly with a mild operation process are promising for removal
of heavy metal ions in wastewater. The design and preparation of functionalized
composite adsorbent materials with multiple-site adsorption ability
remain the most attractive in effectively removing heavy metal ions.
Inspired by the macroporous structure of charged polystyrene (PS)
resin and chelation of Schiff bases with heavy metal ions, smart composite
adsorbents are constructed based on the combination and synergistic
effect of multiple hydrophobic, π–π stacking, and
electrostatic noncovalent interactions between polystyrene resin and
naphthylidene-containing Schiff base (NSB). The resulting hybrid nanomaterials
(PS-NSB) have uniform porous structures and well-defined and multiple
target sites. These properties promote diffusion of the target ion,
increase the binding site, and enhance the removal efficacy. This
study offers a new strategy to harness a self-assembled Schiff base
with integrated flexibility and multifunctions to enhance target metal
ion specific binding and removal effects, highlighting opportunities
to develop smart composite adsorbents.

1 Introduction
Among the many water pollutions,
heavy metal pollution accounts
for a considerable proportion. Heavy metal pollution is easy to be
enriched and expanded in the biological chain, and it poses a serious
threat to public safety even at trace concentrations. Therefore, the
problem of heavy metal pollution in water has seriously jeopardized
the ecological environment and human life and health.1,2 At present, the methods for treating heavy metals are adsorption,
photocatalytic degradation, chemical precipitation, ion exchange,
electrochemistry, membrane separation, and so on.3−7 Adsorption mainly uses adsorption materials with
high specific surface area or special functional groups to adsorb
heavy metal ions in wastewater. As a traditional heavy metal wastewater
treatment method, the adsorption method has the advantages of simple
operation, high efficiency, low energy consumption, no secondary pollution,
and low investment cost and is considered as the most promising method
for removing heavy metals from wastewater.8−11 The research method for the treatment
of heavy metal ions by adsorption is to prepare functional materials
with high specific surface area or functional groups, which have high
adsorption capacity and the ability of rapid adsorption and balance.
However, commercial materials as adsorbents not only lead to unspecific
forces but also restrict selectivity against target heavy metals and
thus the removal performance of the heavy contamination. The development
of new organic functional materials is also a hotspot in current water
treatment research. By synthesizing functional materials, modifying
and grafting existing materials, or giving them new groups and new
functions, the resulting materials have the capability of chemical
adsorption and specific chelation with heavy metal ions in water,
so as to remove heavy metal ions. In light of this, constructing composite
adsorbents, which synergize multiple interaction capability and superior
selectivity, would be highly imperative for promoting sewage treatment.

Although copper is an essential trace nutrient for living organisms,
it can still have adverse public health effects when ingested in large
doses.12 Therefore, it still remains a
formidable challenge to design and create high efficient adsorbing
materials for selective removal of copper. Polystyrene (PS) resin
is a promising commercial absorbent candidate that has shown porosity,
high specific surface area, and long service life with superior reusability.13,14 Nevertheless, the direct application of polystyrene resin is hindered
by its unspecific interaction forces due to the fact that it mainly
adsorbs hydrophobic substances from aqueous solution by van der Waals
forces and adsorbs heavy metal ions by electrostatic interaction.
Various strategies such as encapsulation of an organic small molecule
to resin have been explored to resolve these problems.15 For example, immobilization of polyethylenimine
nanoclusters onto a cation exchange resin through self-cross-linking
has been explored to improve the absorption ability of Cu(II).16 A Schiff base is a kind of compound with an
imine (−C=N) structure formed by the reaction of active carbonyl
and amino compounds in the molecule and can form stable complexes
with transition metal elements.17,18 Schiff base compounds
and their metal complex compounds have wide applications in medicine,
catalysis, and analytical chemistry.19−21 Schiff bases, especially
some aromatic Schiff bases, tend to form stable complexes with copper
due to the presence of −C=N double bonds and −OH group
of the aromatic ring.22 Currently, increasing
composite base on Schiff base molecules has been obtained for selective
removal of trace heavy ion pollutants.23,24

Herein,
we report a novel noncovalent self-assembly strategy based
on the combination of sulfonate group charged polystyrene resin and
naphthylidene-containing Schiff base (NSB) to design and engineer
composite nanoadsorbents for selective removal of Cu(II) (Figure 1). In the resulting
complex absorbents, the naphthylidene-containing Schiff base is inserted
into the polystyrene both through π–π stacking
between aromatic ring and naphthalene ring and electrostatic force
between sulfonate groups and the protonated amino group. Moreover,
Schiff bases have shown flexibility and versatility in designing self-assembled
nanomaterials for Cu(II) adsorption due to double coordination interactions
between −C=N groups and −OH groups with copper ions.
Therefore, the PS-NSB composite demonstrates high absorption efficiency
along with excellent selectivity for the copper ion. Additionally,
the absorption efficiency of the nanoagents was readily manipulated
by modulating the solution pH values, ionic strength, and temperature.
Meanwhile, the experimental results of the adsorption equilibrium
from Cu(II) solution correlated well with the kinetic equation. Taken
together, the combined multiple noncovalent interactions simultaneously
increase selectivity for copper, leading to enhanced absorption efficiency.

the strategy of noncovalent assembly by using Schiff base and sulfonate
group charged polystyrene resin as building blocks for preferential
adsorption of Cu(II).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
of PS-NSB and Metal Composites
The polystyrene resin (PS)
is an excellent commercial absorption
material due to its macroporous structure, high specific surface area,
good mechanical strength, low fluid resistance, fast exchange speed,
and strong pollution resistance.13,14 Because of
these unique advantages, polystyrene resin shows potential in environmental
protection such as removal of heavy metals from sewage. It has adsorption
capacity due to van der Waals force, and it has screening performance
because of its network structure and high specific surface area. The
initial PS bead was present as a spherical bead with diameters of
400–600 μm and well characterized in our previous reports.25−27 On the other hand, Schiff base molecules have good complexation
for most transition metal ions since the lone pair electrons contained
in nitrogen atoms and carbon–nitrogen double bonds can be used
as electron donors to coordinate with most metal ions to form stable
complexes.17,18 The introduction of a naphthalene
ring with a planar structure, large volume, and strong rigidity increases
the π conjugate of Schiff base molecules, thereby facilitating
assembly with the host resin material. When chelated with a metal
ion, the phenolic hydroxyl oxygen atom on the naphthalene ring of
the Schiff base is also involved in coordination and can be complexed
with a plurality of transition metal ions to form a more stable coordinated
chelate.22

Figure 2a–c,g–i shows the SEM photographs
of the modified PS-NSB resin before and after chelation with metal
ions. It can be seen that the surface of the PS-NSB resin is rough
and shows a macroporous morphology, indicating that the functionalization
of NSB does not affect its surface morphology, which may be due to
the planar rigid structure of the naphthalene ring in the Schiff base
molecule. This macroporous morphology facilitates the mass transfer
and diffusion of the adsorption process. Furthermore, the elemental
Cu and Ca cross section distribution of PS-NSB shown in Figure 2d–f,j–l detected
by SEM-EDS clearly demonstrated that Cu and Ca were embedded into
PS-NSB resin and were homogeneously distributed within the composite
resin. It can be interpreted that the electrostatic attraction of
charged sulfonate groups of PS resin will facilitate the divalent
metal cation to further diffuse into the internal region of PS. This
mentioned that the Schiff base can chelate with metal ions through
coordination interaction to form a stable metal complex. The uniform
coverage of copper indicates that the distribution of Schiff base
compounds is homogeneous, which again confirmed the assembly between
Schiff base molecules and host materials. Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) images presented in Figure 3 also reveal that these composite materials are macroporous
structures, almost consistent with the SEM result. As shown in Figure 4, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis disclosed that abundant nanoclusters within
tens of nanometer size could be found in PS-NSB composites, which
originated in random dispersion of the −C=N– group and
−OH group on the NSB chain.

Figure 5 shows
the
FTIR spectra of NSB molecules and the resulting PS-NSB composite materials.
The characteristic absorption peak at around 3400 cm–1 in PS-NSB significantly enhanced, which could be assigned to the
stretching vibration of −OH groups that likely combined the
phenol −OH with water. Peaks appearing at 2927 and 2848 cm–1 in PS-NSB were assigned to the stretching vibration
of flexible alkyl chains with −NH groups in the introduced
ligands. In addition, it could be seen from the infrared spectrum
that characteristic peaks of −C=N, C–O, and C=C appeared
at 1634, 1280, and 1540 cm–1 after the modification
process. The above changes in the infrared absorption peaks indicate
that the Schiff base groups have been successfully introduced into
the inner space in resin beads. TG was performed to investigate the
thermal properties of PS and PS-NSB from room temperature to 700 °C
in a nitrogen atmosphere given in Figure 6. We can observe that all samples show apparent
weight loss at nearly 100 °C, which can be attributed to the
evaporation of water molecules inserted into the resin. With respect
to PS resin, a sharp drop in weight appears at an elevated temperature
(400–470 °C), indicating thermal degradation of the network
structure of PS. Moreover, the introduction of Schiff base molecules
slightly reduced the thermal stability of the composite resin, mainly
because the presence of the strong hydrophobic naphthalene ring of
the Schiff base ensured high thermal stability.28,29 Therefore, self-assembled naphthylidene-containing Schiff base anchored
polystyrene nanocomposites could be applied for developing the adsorbent
of high thermal stability. However, after adsorption of bivalent copper
ions, major losses in weight of the PS-NSB-Cu are found at 300 and
450 °C, which seems that the coordination bond of the copper
coordinate chelate breaks at lower temperature.

2.2 Adsorption Performances of PS and PS-NSB Nanocomposites
It can be clearly seen from Figure 7 that a pH value increase does not significantly enhance
the adsorption effect and the adsorption efficiency is poor (<30%)
for the PS resin alone. However, the adsorption of Cu(II) by PS-NSB
resin is greatly affected by the pH value of the solution. Some basic
reactions involved in the solution are as follows: 1   2   3   4  

Figure 7 Effect of solution pH
on Cu(II) uptake by PS, PS-NpN1, and PS-NpN2
nanocomposites at 298 K (initial Cu(II) 15 mg/L).

Under strong acidic conditions (pH < 3), H+ and Cu(II)
will compete for the site of the adsorbent surface, and at the same
time, the protonation of the sulfonate of PS and −C=N group
in Schiff base will also be unfavorable for the adsorption of Cu(II)
(reactions 2 and 3), so the adsorption amount
is lower. When the pH value is increased to 3–4, the deprotonation
of the sulfonate group and −C=N group is enhanced and conducive
to binding and chelating with copper ions,30 thus promoting adsorption of copper ions. When the pH value continues
to increase to around 6, the addition of hydroxyl oxygen can enable
formation of a more stable coordinate chelate with the −C=N
group (reactions 3 and 4). Notably, the Cu(II) absorption
performance by the Schiff base with longer ethyleneamine spacers was
remarkable, indicating the self-assembly effect on the fabrication
of the composite adsorbent, which was due to the electrostatic driving
force of negatively charged sulfonate of PS and deprotonated ethyleneamine
of the Schiff base. In more alkaline conditions, precipitation of
copper hydroxide occurs simultaneously with adsorption of divalent
copper ions.31 Therefore, the optimum pH
value obtained from the above is 5.5–6.5 and adjusted to this
range in subsequent adsorption experiments.

In actual production,
the types of heavy metal ions in wastewater
are often various, so the influence of the competitive ions especially
alkaline earth ions of the solution on the adsorption performance
must also be investigated.32,33 Hence, it is crucial
to assess the capture tendency of PS-NSB toward the target ion in
the presence of other competitive ions. The influences of divalent
competitive ions on divalent copper ion removal performance of the
obtained PS-NSB hybrid adsorbent were also measured, with the original
PS as control. Experimental data from Figure 8a,b shows that the removal rate of Cu(II)
by PS-NSB decreases with the increase of the proportion of competitive
ions; when the mole ratio is increased to 1:64, the removal rate only
decreases from 100 to 60%, which indicates that PS-NSB still has a
good Cu(II) cleaning effect in the presence of high concentrations
of competing ions than PS resin. The effect of ionic strength on the
adsorption effect of specific metal ions mainly includes the influence
of the existence of heavy metal ions and the adsorption sites on the
adsorbent surface. In order to eliminate the interference of ionic
strength, we also measured the influences of the monovalent sodium
ion on copper ion removal performance of the obtained PS-NSB hybrid
adsorbent. Figure 8c reveals that adsorption of PS-NSB materials is insensitive to lower
ionic strength, probably due to the formation of inner surface complexes
of divalent heavy metal cations with carbon–nitrogen double
bonds and the phenolic hydroxyl oxygen atom on the Schiff base molecule,
thus confirming the self-assembly of PS and Schiff base. However,
at high ionic strength, the adsorption capacity of heavy metal ions
slightly decreases with increasing ionic strength. According to the
electrostatic double layer theory,34 when
the ionic strength of the solution increases, the double-layer static
electricity of the adsorbent is compressed and the repulsion is weakened,
which may cause the adsorbent ions to aggregate and change the total
adsorption sites of the adsorbent, thereby changing its adsorption
effect of heavy metal ions. This is because sulfonate groups of PS
resin can sequestrate divalent copper ions via nonspecific electrostatic
forces and other competitive ions would compete for the active sorption
sites, while carbon–nitrogen double bonds and the phenolic
hydroxyl oxygen atom of the Schiff base are considered to fix Cu(II)
by specific coordination complexation. Therefore, when the concentration
of divalent competing ions in the water is high, PS-NSB can still
meet the demand for Cu(II) removal.

lead ions onto PS-NpN1
and NpN2 (compared to PS). (a–c) 0.05 g adsorbent, initial
Cu(II) = 15 mg/L, pH = 6.5–7, 298 K; (d) effect of removal
of Cu(II) by PS-NpN2 nanocomposites at different temperatures (initial
Cu(II) 15 mg/L).

Moreover, temperature
is one of the important environmental factors
affecting adsorption.35 It has different
effects on a series of chemical and physical processes such as adsorption–desorption,
precipitation–dissolution, and oxidation–reduction of
heavy metals. Therefore, changes in temperature may also result in
changes in the amount of adsorption. We also tested the absorption
curve of PS-NSB versus the absorption temperature. As depicted in
the curves of Figure 8d, the adsorption rate of the PS-NpN2 nanocomposite increased with
the increment of the solution temperature, mainly because the increase
of temperature increases the number of active sites of the adsorbent
and increases the diffusion rate of heavy metal ions from solution
into the interior of PS-NSB. It also shows that the adsorption of
Cu(II) on PS-NSB is an endothermic process and high temperature is
more favorable for the adsorption reaction.

2.3 Adsorption
Kinetics of PS and PS-NSB Nanocomposites
The adsorption time
is an important factor affecting the adsorption
of heavy metal ions by the adsorbent. As the adsorption time is prolonged,
the treatment cycle is prolonged and the economic benefits are affected.
The macroporous structure of the resin material and the large specific
surface area will help to increase the rate of adsorption of heavy
metal ions, greatly reducing the time required to reach equilibrium.
It was found from Figure 9a that the adsorption of Cu(II) by PS resin reached dynamic
equilibrium for more than 250 min. In the initial adsorption stage
(0–20 min), the removal rate and adsorption amount of Cu(II)
of PS-NSB increased significantly. After reaching a certain period
of time (about 60 min), the adsorption rate of composites gradually
slowed down and finally reached equilibrium. This is mainly due to
the fact that, in the early stage of adsorption, a large number of
adsorption sites on the surface of PS-NSB composite materials have
not been occupied and Cu(II) is rapidly adsorbed; as the adsorption
process progresses, the surface of PS-NSB materials is occupied by
more and more Cu(II). Due to the repulsive force between the Cu(II)
and the reduction of the adsorption site, the remaining Cu(II) is
not easily adsorbed, and therefore, the adsorption rate is slowed
down until the adsorption equilibrium is reached. In contrast, the
adsorption rate of composites is much faster than that of PS resin,
indicating that PS-NSB materials have good application prospects.
In addition, in order to further study the adsorption mechanism of
PS resin and PS-NSB resin, the kinetic adsorption process of Cu(II)
was simulated by the kinetic equation. The equation expressions are
as follows.36

Figure 9 Adsorption kinetic curves
of PS, PS-NpN1, and PS-NpN2 nanocomposites
on Cu(II): (a) pseudo-first-order model curves; (b) pseudo-second-order
model curves.

The pseudo-first-order
model is 5  

The pseudo-second-order model is 6  where qe and qt are the
Cu(II) absorption
amounts (mg/g) at equilibrium and time t, respectively,
and K1 and K2 are the rate constants of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order
adsorption formula, respectively. The pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order
kinetic curves of PS and NSB resin for Cu(II) adsorption are shown
in Figure 9. The corresponding
kinetic parameter values can be obtained from fitting formula in Figure 9a or the slope and
intercept of the line in Figure 9b. The adsorption kinetic fitting parameters of Cu(II)
are listed in Table 1. The suitability of the model can be judged by the correlation coefficient
of the fit. Compared to the pseudo-first-order model, the adsorption
process conforms to the pseudo-second-order kinetic adsorption model,
indicating that the adsorption of Cu(II) on the resin is controlled
by the internal diffusion process (physical adsorption) and the surface
reaction process (chemical adsorption). This is because the resin
is a sphere filled with pores on the surface and the Schiff base group
inside the PS has a good chelation effect on Cu(II), so the adsorption
process has both chemical adsorption and physical adsorption.

Adsorption capacity and desorption
capacity are two optimal parameters
for evaluating the adsorption effect of the adsorbent. The ideal adsorbent
should not only have high adsorption performance but should also be
recyclable, both of which can be important criteria to measure the
practical application of the adsorbent. We used HCl–NaCl solution to desorb the PS-NSB composite
after Cu(II) adsorption. The results in Figure 10 show that the removal rate of Cu(II) by
PS-NSB decreases with the increase of elution readsorption times,
but after five adsorption–desorption cycles, the removal rate
is still as high as 90%, compared with the first adsorption. This
shows that the PS-NSB composite showed excellent reusability after
five cycles.37−44 Therefore, it has broad application prospects and expands new ideas
for the research of similar self-assembled nanocomposites in the future.45−54

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we developed new composite materials through self-assembled
naphthylidene-containing Schiff base anchored polystyrene nanocomposites
driven by electrostatic and π–π stacking interactions
as adsorbents for Cu(II) removal. These composite adsorbents possess
large surface area, developed internal microporous structures, excellent
stability against high temperature, and efficient selectivity, thus
enabling diffusion of the target ion and enhancing the removal efficacy.
Meanwhile, PS-NSB composites demonstrate excellent cyclic adsorption
properties and can maintain good adsorption capacity after repeated
use. Present interesting research work offers versatility in the preparation
of effective adsorbent materials for heavy ion removal in wastewater
treatment.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
and Instruments
Sulfonate
group charged polystyrene resin (cross-linking degree of ∼8%)
was obtained from Jiangsu Nanda Environmental Technology Ltd. Before
being employed, the bead particles were sieved (0.4–0.6 mm)
and subjected to extraction with ethanol in a Soxhlet apparatus to
remove the residue impurities. Finally, the resulting PS beads were
dried under vacuum at 358 K for 24 h. In addition, we have previously
synthesized two different lengths of ethyleneamine spacer naphthylidene-containing
Schiff base (NSB) units (Figure 1), abbreviated as NPN1 and NPN2.55 The metal ion used was the nitric
acid solution of metal and obtained from Beijing Chemical Co. Ltd.
(Beijing, China). The solvents used were purchased from Beijing Chemical
Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China) without further purification.

4.2 Preparation of the PS-NSB Nanocomposites
The PS was
purified to remove impurities: First, hydrochloric acid
solution with a pH of 2 was prepared. A certain amount of PS was immersed
in hydrochloric solution and stirred at room temperature for 10 h.
After standing, the solution was washed to the neutral state with
distilled water. Then the resulting PS was treated with sodium hydroxide
(mass fraction 5%) by the same treatment process and dried at 40 °C
under vacuum to a constant weight before further use. Two different
lengths of the ethyleneamine spacer naphthylidene-containing Schiff
base (NSB) molecule (Figure 1), abbreviated as NPN1 and NPN2, were
reported in our previous work.51

In a typical self-assembly method, 2 g of the prepared Schiff base
containing the naphthylene group was dissolved in 100 mL of ethanol
solution overnight until completely dissolved into a yellow solution.
Then 10.0 g of swelled PS resin was added into the obtained ethanol
solution containing Schiff base molecules. Under stirring at a constant
temperature overnight, the PS resin and the naphthylidene-containing
Schiff base molecule self-assembled driven by electrostatic force
and π–π stacking force. After incubation, the PS
showed a yellow color, indicating the formation of nanocomposites.
After the reaction was complete, the product was separated by suction
filtration, repeatedly washed with absolute ethanol and deionized
water to remove the residual reactants and inorganic salts, making
the pH of washing solution neutral, and dried at 60 °C under
vacuum to a constant weight to obtain microspheres before further
use.

4.3 Adsorption Performance Tests
Static
adsorption kinetic experiment: PS-NSB (0.50 g) and PS (0.50 g) were
placed in 500 mL of copper nitrate solution (concentration of Cu2+ is 15 mg/L) and then oscillated at a rate of 600 rpm in
a constant temperature shaker at 298 K. Removing 1 mL of the solution
at regular intervals, the concentration of copper ions in the sample
was determined, and the adsorption removal efficiency was calculated.
Finally, the kinetic curves of adsorption time and removal rate were
obtained.

Effect of pH on adsorption: 10 portions of PS-NSB
(0.05 g) and PS (0.05 g) were accurately weighed and placed separately
in a 150 mL conical flask. 50 mL of copper nitrate solution (concentration
of Cu2+ is 15 mg/L) was added to each conical flask, and
the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 1–7 (equal spacing)
by HNO3 and NaOH. Then the sample was placed in a constant
temperature oscillator with a rotational speed of 600 rpm. After 24
h of constant temperature oscillation, the sample was taken out and
the equilibrium Cu2+ concentration and the corresponding
pH value were determined.

Competitive adsorption experiment:
50 mL Ca2+/Cu2+ solutions with molar ratios
of 0, 8, 16, 32, and 64 (Cu2+: 15 mg/L) were put separately
in 150 mL conical flasks.
Then PS-NSB (0.05 g) and PS (0.05 g) were added in the corresponding
conical flask. The sample was placed in a constant temperature (298
K) water bath shaker with a rotating speed of 600 rpm, and the concentration
of Cu2+ in the solution at equilibrium was determined after
being shaken for 24 h. In the same way, the competitive ions were
changed into Mg2+ or Na+, and the concentration
of Cu2+ in the solution was determined after the experiment.

Effect of temperature on adsorption: PS-NSB (0.05 g) and PS (0.05
g) were placed separately in 150 mL conical flasks. 50 mL of copper
nitrate solution (concentration of Cu2+ is 15 mg/L) was
added to each conical flask and then oscillated at a rate of 600 rpm
for a certain period of time in a constant temperature shaker at different
temperatures (25, 45, 65 °C). After the adsorption was complete,
a certain amount of solution was taken, and the concentration of Cu(II)
was measured by a spectrophotometer.

4.4 Characterization
Infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) was determined by an FTIR Fourier infrared spectrometer (Thermo
Nicolet Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) by the KBr tablet method in
the wavenumber range of 3600–500 cm–1. Scanning
electron microscope images were obtained by a Field Emission Gun FEI
QUANTA FEG 250 (FEI Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA) with energy dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) for qualitative chemical analysis. Morphology characterizations
of the materials were also obtained on air-dried carbon-coated copper
grids by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) Hitachi HT7700
(Ibaraki, Japan) and a Nanoscope model Multimode 8 Scanning Probe
Microscope (Veeco Instruments, USA).The pH of the solution was measured
by a HANNA pH meter. The metal ion concentration was determined by
a Shimadzu AA-6800 atomic absorption/emission spectrometer. Themogravimetry-differential
scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) data were recorded with a NETZSCH STA
409 PC Luxx Simultaneous thermal analyzer (Netzsch Instruments Manufacturing
Co, Ltd., Germany) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The experiment was
carried out in a G-25 model incubator shaker with a thermostat.
