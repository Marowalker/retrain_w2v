Study of manganese
oxides for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic
oxidation of water is an active area of research. The starting material
in this study is a high-surface-area disordered birnessite-like material
with K+ in the interlayers (KMnOx). Upon ion-exchange with
Fe3+, the disordered layer structure collapses (Fe(IE)MnOx),
and the surface area is slightly increased. Structural analysis of
the Fe(IE)MnOx included examination of its morphology, crystal structure,
vibrational spectra, and manganese oxidation states. Using the Ru(bpy)32+–persulfate system, the dissolved and
headspace oxygen upon visible light photolysis with highly dispersed
Fe(IE)MnOx was measured. The photocatalytic activity for O2 evolution of the Fe(IE)MnOx was three times better than KMnOx, with
the highest rate being 9.3 mmolO2 molMn–1 s–1. The improvement of the
photocatalytic activity was proposed to arise from the increased disorder
and interaction of Fe3+ with the MnO6 octahedra.
As a benchmark, colloidal IrO2 was a better photocatalyst
by a factor of ∼75 over Fe(IE)MnOx.

Introduction
Photocatalytic water
splitting with solar energy to produce hydrogen
and oxygen is of current interest.1,2 In this process,
the water oxidation couple is more challenging because of unfavorable
thermodynamics and kinetics. Rare metal oxides, including IrO2 and RuO2, are very good catalysts for water oxidation,
as demonstrated with the tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium–persulfate
system,3−5 but they are not practical for large-scale use because
of their limited occurrence in nature. Considerable research has,
therefore, focused on the first-row transition metals, including Mn,
Co, Ni, and Fe, because of their high natural abundance. The oxides
and hydroxides of these metals exhibit both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic
activity.6−12 Other well-studied water oxidation systems include photoelectrochemical
organic species,13 inorganic oxides with
appropriate band gaps,14 and polymeric
photocatalysts.15

Stemming from the
presence of the manganese oxide cluster for water
oxidation in photosystem II of natural photosynthesis,16,17 considerable research has focused on manganese oxides.18−22 Different crystalline polymorphs of manganese oxides exhibit photocatalytic
activity. Structural aspects such as elongated, flexible, and weaker
MnIII–O bonds (Jahn–Teller distortion) found
in edge-sharing MnO6 octahedra in manganese oxides are
correlated with catalytic properties.23 Amorphous manganese oxides are also water-oxidizing catalysts, and
the importance of a disordered structure in promoting oxygen mobility
was noted.24 The disorder exposes more
Mn-active sites and cationic vacancies containing unsaturated oxygens,
promoting catalysis. Birnessites, layered like manganese oxide, contain
ion-exchangeable hydrated cations within the interlayers.24,25 Interlayer cations improve the catalytic activity of birnessite
in heterogeneous electrochemical systems.26−28

Various
synthetic strategies are reported for incorporation of
elements into birnessites, including ion-exchange, doping, and coating
with metals. Copper was introduced into a birnessite structure by
in situ method and via ion-exchange. The presence of Cu0 alters the electrical properties of birnessite, lowering the charge
transfer resistance and promoting the catalysis.26 Intercalating Ni2+ and Co2+ into
the birnessite interlayer also enhances electrochemical catalytic
activity of birnessite as compared to cations doped into octahedral
sites of the lattice.27,28 Cobalt-intercalated birnessite
has been investigated as a cathode electrode material for lithium-ion
batteries.29

In this study, we start
with a very disordered birnessite structure
with K+ in the interlayers and ion-exchange Fe3+ into this material. We examine how the ion-exchange process alters
the structure of KMnOx as well as the photocatalytic water oxidation
activity of the ion-exchanged samples. Structural analysis involves
examining the morphology, crystal structure, surface spectroscopy,
and Raman spectroscopy. Photocatalytic activity was examined by measuring
dissolved and headspace oxygen produced in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ and S2O82–. These iron-based modifications of KMnOx have not been examined
for photocatalytic water splitting.

Results
Synthesis Strategy
The synthesis strategy for KMnOx
has been reported in the literature and involves mixing an aqueous
solution of manganese(II)acetate and potassium permanganate to form
birnessite.21 The reaction proceeds as
follows:  

This is a complicated
multistep electron
transfer reaction involving several intermediate oxidation states
of manganese, in particular Mn3+.30,31 Though most of the Mn3+ is oxidized to Mn4+, some remains and is incorporated into birnessite.32 This is an autocatalytic reaction, with initial formation
of birnessite accelerating the rate of further precipitation. The
manganese oxide thus prepared has K+ incorporated into
the structure and is referred to as KMnOx. The KMnOx was ion-exchanged
with ferric nitrate and samples are identified as Fe(IE)MnOx_N, where IE stands for ion-exchange and N is the concentration of Fe3+ (mM) during the ion-exchange.
The samples studied in this paper are identified in Scheme 1.

Structural Characterization
KMnOx
Elemental
analysis for Mn in KMnOx was carried
out with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and found to be 48%
Mn (by weight) and is reported in Table 1. The electron micrograph of KMnOx shown
in Figure 1a indicates
aggregates of ∼100 nm particles. These particles could be readily
dispersed into a clear suspension by sonication. The surface area
of KMnOx was measured to be 212 m2/g.

Figure 1b shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) of KMnOx, with peaks at 2θ ∼12.5°
(001, ∼7 Å), ∼24° (002, ∼3.5 Å),
∼37° (100, ∼2.4 Å), and ∼66° (110,
∼1.4 Å), indicating a turbostratic hexagonal birnessite-like
structure of KMnOx.25,33,34 The birnessite structure is made up of layers of edge-connected
MnO6 octahedra with K+ in the interlayers. The
broad peaks indicate both disorder and small crystal size, the latter
also evident from the ready dispersion in water without settling.
The ratio of the “d” values of the
100 and 110 peaks of 1.7 as well as the symmetric nature of the 110
peak are indicative of the hexagonal symmetry.35−37

Raman
spectra of KMnOx in Figure 1c show bands at ∼287 cm–1 (w),
∼506 cm–1 (w), ∼573 cm–1 (s), ∼640 cm–1 (s), and ∼730 cm–1 (w), which matches with birnessite.38 The peak at ∼570 cm–1 is assigned
to the ν3(Mn–O) vibration along the basal
plane of the MnO6 octahedra. The peak at ∼650 cm–1 is assigned to the ν2(Mn–O)
symmetric vibration perpendicular to the chains of MnO6 octahedra. The Raman excitation was carried out with a 785 nm laser
with a spinning sample holder. With 514.5 nm excitation under similar
conditions, the spectrum changed with time (Figure S1). Thus, caution needs to be exercised to avoid photodegradation
by choice of the appropriate laser excitation and using a spinning
cell holder during the Raman experiments.

Figures 1d and S2 show
the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
spectra of the K, Mn, and O present in KMnOx. There have been several
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies of MnOx compounds.32,33,39−42 The two peaks at ∼293 and 296 eV are assigned
to K 2p (Figure S2a). The peaks at ∼530
and ∼532 eV are assigned to the presence of lattice oxygen
or oxides (OL) and surface-adsorbed oxygen or hydroxyl
(OS) (Figure S2c, high-energy
shoulder assigned to water).43 Mn 2p spectra
exhibited two characteristic peaks at ∼642.09 and ∼653.81
eV, corresponding to Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2,
respectively (Figure 1d). Several studies have focused on the interpretation of the Mn
2p3/2 region,32,39 and are used as the
basis for the assignments. The multiplet of peaks, with the major
peak at 642.09 eV, along with the shoulder at 643 eV and the broad
band between 645 and 647 eV, are characteristic of Mn4+. The low-energy shoulder at 640 eV is possibly due to Mn3+ (or Mn2+).

XPS data can be used to predict the
average oxidation state (AOS)
of Mn. These include analysis of the splitting of the Mn 3s because
of exchange interaction between the 3s–3d levels and from fitting
of the O1s spectra.44,45 We have used these methods to
calculate AOS, and the results are listed in Table 2. The Mn 3s splitting for KMnOx in Figure S2b is 5.15 and using the equation AOSMn = 13.2 – 1.91(ΔBE), we calculate AOS of Mn
to be +3.4 for KMnOx. For O 1s, an example of the calculation is provided
in the Supporting Information section (Table
S1) and calculates a value of +3.5. The bulk AOS was determined by
a chemical titration method, which involves reaction of oxalic acid
with the sample and then back-titration by KMnO4,46 which determined AOS of +3.2. The AOS from the
three methods averages to +3.4. The XPS-based methods provided AOS
of 3.72–3.75 for a birnessite-type compound on granular activated
carbon.33

Fe(IE)MnOx
Fe(IE)MnOx_5, Fe(IE)MnOx_50, Fe(IE)MnOx_200,
and Fe(IE)MnOx_400 contain Mn (wt %) of 46.0, 33.0, 34.0, and 33.0
and Fe (wt %) of 3.2, 8.9, 10.4, and 10.2, respectively (Table 1). The electron micrographs
of these samples shown in Figure 2 are similar to KMnOx (Figure 1a), consisting of aggregates of primary particles
(∼100 nm), and readily dispersed in aqueous solution by sonication.
The surface areas of Fe(IE)MnOx_5, Fe(IE)MnOx_50, Fe(IE)MnOx_200,
and Fe(IE)MnOx_400 were 287, 260, 220, and 256 m2/g, respectively.

Powder diffraction of the Fe(IE)MnOx shown in Figure 3 consists of broad peaks at
∼37° (100) and ∼66° (110). The basal peaks
at ∼12° and ∼24° present in KMnOx were absent
in all samples, indicative of a structure in which there is random
stratification of the layers and possibly stacking of only a few layers.
Such XRD patterns have been reported in the literature.47−49 For example, the XRD pattern similar to Figure 3 with the absence of basal reflections was
observed in the early stages of birnessite formation before the sheets
had an opportunity to stack up along the c axis.47 In another study, with increasing Al3+ and Fe3+ introduced during the synthesis of birnessite,
the basal reflections disappeared.48 Also,
manganese oxide nanoparticles synthesized on polystyrene spheres only
showed the hl peaks and assigned to ultrathin stacks
of very few lamellae.49

The Raman spectra and the curve deconvolution for Fe(IE)MnOx
samples
are shown in Figure 4. The major Raman bands at 287, 506, 573, 640, and 730 cm–1 matched with KMnOx, indicating that the MnO6 octahedral
structure is being maintained. For samples Fe(IE)MnOx_50, Fe(IE)MnOx_200,
and Fe(IE)MnOx_400, the weak shoulder at ∼700 cm–1 is observed upon deconvolution and is assigned to ferrihydrite.50 Typically, ferrihydrite also shows a sharp nitrate
Raman band at 1046 cm–1, and is not discernible.
With the increase in Fe3+ content during ion-exchange,
the ferrihydrite band remains weak and does not increase in intensity.

XPS data in the K 2p region for the Fe(IE)MnOx samples are
shown
in Figure 5. The Fe(IE)MnOx_5
sample exhibited weak K 2p peaks. In case of other Fe(IE)MnOx samples,
the K+ signal was absent, indicating that K+ is replaced by Fe3+ cations. XPS in the Mn 2p region
is similar to KMnOx, and suggests that the mixture of Mn3+/Mn4+ species is remaining unchanged with ion exchange
(Figure S3). XPS of the Mn 3s region is
shown in Figure S4. The peak because of
Fe 3s (94 eV) was observed along with the Mn 3s peak, and the intensity
of the Fe peak increased with the increase in the concentration of
Fe in the samples. All samples also exhibited peaks at ∼710,
∼724 eV, and a satellite peak at ∼719 eV in the Fe 2p
region, indicating the presence of Fe3+ cations (Figure S5). From XPS, the ratio of atomic concentration
of Fe and Mn (Fe/Mn) was 0.04, 0.15, 0.23, and 0.24 for Fe(IE)MnOx_5,
Fe(IE)MnOx_50, Fe(IE)MnOx_200, and Fe(IE)MnOx_400, respectively, consistent
with the trend of the atomic absorption results shown in Table 1.

samples with N being

The O 1s region XPS spectra are shown in Figure S6, with peaks at ∼530 and ∼532 eV. Deconvolution
of the peaks allows for estimating the adsorbed and bulk oxygen. The
ratio of the surface-adsorbed oxygen to the oxygen in Mn–O–Mn
is shown in Table S2. Increasing surface-adsorbed
oxygen or hydroxyl group (OS) with the introduction in
Fe3+ is evident from the O 1s XPS (Figure S6 and Table S2). The AOS
calculations for Mn in Fe(IE)MnOx were carried out with Mn 3s and
O 1s peaks, and data shown in Table 2, which were in the range of +3.3 to 3.5. The chemical
titration method cannot be used for the iron-based compounds.

Photocatalytic Activity
Control experiments were carried
out for blank samples (without catalyst) for photocatalytic water
oxidation. As reported in the literature,21 there was a small amount of dissolved oxygen formation (<0.3
μmol) within the first 50 s with only Ru(bpy)32+ and S2O82– in the
borate buffer system (Figure S7). However,
there was no photocatalytic activity in the absence of Ru(bpy)32+ and S2O82–. In addition, as the Fe(IE)MnOx is colored, we repeated the photolysis
experiment with only Fe(IE)MnOx and persulfate, and no oxygen evolution
was observed (shown in Figure S8.)

The catalyst amounts used in the photolysis of all samples were different
as they were adjusted to the same Mn content of 1 mg. Thus, catalytic
activity because of Mn can be compared between samples without any
normalizing. The amount of dissolved oxygen as a function of photolysis
time was measured with a fluorescence probe, similar to numerous studies
reported in the literature.23,25,51,52 These experiments usually last
a few minutes, and a saturated level of dissolved oxygen is reached.
Headspace oxygen measurements are discussed later. Figure 6a compares the photocatalytic
ability of KMnOx with Fe(IE)MnOx. The turnover frequency (TOF) and
the total amount of dissolved oxygen are shown in Table 3.

The catalytic activity of KMnOx was 3.2 ±
0.1 mmolO2 molMn–1 s–1 (experiment repeated three times with different
sample aliquots of KMnOx).

Fe(IE)MnOx
For Fe(IE)MnOx_5, Fe(IE)MnOx_50,
Fe(IE)MnOx_200,
and Fe(IE)MnOx_400, oxygen evolution rates were 7.7 ± 0.2, 8.1
± 0.6, 8.8 ± 0.8, and 9.3 ± 0.7 mmolO2 molMn–1 s–1 [experiments repeated three times with different sample aliquots
of Fe(IE)MnOx]. With the increase in concentration of Fe(III), the
catalytic activity of Fe(IE)MnOx keeps increasing.

Raman spectra
suggested the presence of ferrihydrite in the samples. To evaluate
the impact of ferrihydrite on the catalytic activity, photocatalytic
water oxidation was carried out with ferrihydrite (5 mg of Fe in the
sample). The catalytic activity for ferrihydrite was poor compared
to the catalysts shown in Figure 6, with 2.5 μmol of total dissolved oxygen and
a rate of 0.7 mmolO2 molFe–1 s–1 (Figure S9). Besides
the low catalytic activity of ferrihydrite, the amount of ferrihydrite
in Fe(IE)MnOx is small, and, thus, ferrihydrite is not contributing
to the increased rate of oxygen evolution for Fe(IE)MnOx. Moreover,
as the catalyst used in the photolysis was adjusted to the same amount
as Mn (1 mg of Mn, based on the elemental analysis) in all samples,
the presence of ferrihydrite should not influence the rate calculated
based on the Mn.

As Fe(IE)MnOx_400 was the most active catalyst,
reusability tests
were carried out with this sample. The photolysis with Fe(IE)MnOx_400
was carried out for three cycles (1st, 2nd, and 3rd runs) without
washing between cycles (so as not to lose catalyst). The Fe(IE)MnOx_400
catalyst showed repeatable performance with a TOF of 12.0 ± 0.5
mmolO2 molMn–1 s–1 as shown in Figure 6b. After the catalysis experiments, Fe 2p and Ru 3p
XPS spectra were examined for the recovered Fe(IE)MnOx_400. The ratio
of Fe/Mn atomic concentration in the recovered sample was 0.22, and
close to the starting Fe/Mn ratio (0.24) for this particular Fe(IE)MnOx_400
sample (Figure S10), indicating no leaching
of Fe3+. There was no Ru found in the used catalyst, as
seen from the Ru 3p XPS data (Figure S11), indicating that the decomposition of the Ru photosensitizer and
deposition on the MnOx is not occurring.

Discussion
Structural
Changes with Fe3+ Incorporation
The structural
results presented above suggest that KMnOx has the
hexagonal turbostratic birnessite structure. Birnessite is a layered
manganese oxide with edge-sharing MnO6 octahedra chains
which are stacked together, with charge-balancing K+ cations
between the layers. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data of KMnOx
show aggregates made up of primary particles with sizes of ∼100
nm. Both Mn3+and Mn4+ are present in the structure,
and AOS of Mn in KMnOx by several different methods is around +3.4.

With ion-exchange of KMnOx by Fe3+, there were no changes
in morphology of Fe(IE)MnOx samples (Figure 2). They all were aggregates of fine particles.
The surface area increased slightly with iron incorporation, for example,
the surface area of KMnOx was 212 m2/g and increased to
256 m2/g for Fe(IE)MnOx_400. The Raman spectra (Figure 4) indicate that the
MnO6 octahedral structure is maintained. XPS indicates
that K+ is missing in Fe(IE)MnOx_N, with N > 5 (greatly reduced), and both XPS and elemental analysis
indicate the incorporation of Fe3+ in the structure (Figure 5). The AOS of Mn
remains unaltered at around +3.3 to 3.5 for all Fe3+ samples.
The primary change is in the diffraction patterns. For Fe(IE)MnOx
samples, the basal peaks at ∼12° and ∼24°
are missing, indicating disorder in the stacking of layers of manganese
oxides sheets (Figure 3). The difference in the charge of the cations (K+ vs
Fe3+) is inducing further disorder in the already disordered
KMnOx. Increase in disorder is noted in the literature after ion-exchanging
Cu+/Cu2+ cations into birnessite.26

Photocatalysis Mechanism
The catalytic
performance
of Fe(IE)MnOx was significantly better than that of KMnOx with Fe(IE)MnOx_400
reaching a TOF of 9.3 ± 0.7 mmolO2 molMn–1 s–1, whereas KMnOx
has a TOF of 3.2 ± 0.1 mmolO2 molMn–1 s–1, and the slight increase
in surface area of Fe(IE)MnOx_400 does not account for all of the
improved catalytic activity. The steady-state dissolved oxygen for
KMnOx and Fe(IE)MnOx_400 are 8 and 20 μmol, reflecting again
the improved catalytic effect of the latter. The maximum amount of
oxygen possible is controlled by the amount of S2O82–, which was 1600 μmol; thus, the
total possible oxygen is ∼800 μmol and dissolved oxygen
at saturation is ∼92 μmol (considering 25 °C and
1 bar pressure). The saturation of the level of dissolved oxygen well
before the stoichiometric amounts of O2 are formed is typical
of all studies using Ru(bpy)32+ and S2O82–.23,25,51,52

The main difference
between Fe(IE)MnOx and KMnOx is the increased disorder in the structure.
In the ion-exchanging process, Fe3+ replaces K+ cations and brings about disorder in packing of the layers of KMnOx.
Transition metals with small ionic radii are proposed to be located
above and below the MnO6 octahedral vacancy in a layer
separate from the water layer, where the larger K+ is expected
to be located.29

Manganese oxides
with defects and distorted structure lead to structural
flexibility and expose weak Mn3+–O bonds at the
edge-sharing MnO6 octahedral sheets, and enhance electrochemical
water oxidation catalysis.23,25,53 On the basis of an analysis of the various polymorphs of manganese
oxides, it was inferred that Mn3+ in edge-sharing octahedra
forms elongated and weaker Jahn–Teller distorted Mn3+–O (because of the population of antibonding orbital) bonds.23 These weak and flexible Mn3+–O
bonds are favorable for water oxidation because of suitable Mn–O–Mn
motifs for O–O bond formation. Longer Mn–O–Mn
bridges (mono μ-oxo bridges) in the manganese oxides are active
sites for water oxidation, which are mainly found in the disordered
structure.54,55 These sites contain unsaturated
oxygen and hydroxyl groups, which can be involved in accumulation
of the holes, proton release upon hole capture, and proton-coupled
electron transfer necessary for water oxidation.20,22,24

The difference in the electric fields
because of the higher charge
to radius ratio of Fe3+ in Fe(IE)MnOx can induce disorder.
This electrostatic-driven disorder could be playing a role in the
better catalytic activity of Fe(IE)MnOx samples. To verify this hypothesis,
Ga3+, which has similar size to Fe3+ (sizes
of Ga3+ and Fe3+ are 0.61 and 0.64 nm, respectively),
was ion-exchanged into KMnOx and the photocatalytic property was examined.
Gallium exchange also led to a significant loss of the basal reflections
in the XRD. The catalytic activity of the Ga-exchanged sample (Ga3+ concentration used for ion-exchange, 400 mM) was 4.0 mmolO2 molMn–1 s–1 (9.5 μmol of dissolved O2), improved over KMnOx,
but not as high as Fe(IE)MnOx. The structural and catalytic characteristics
of the Ga-exchanged sample are shown in Figures S12–S15. Thus, Fe3+ within the interlayers
is inducing other effects. One possibility is the formation of oxo
bridges between the manganese in the basal plane and iron in the interlayers,
a motif found in ribonucleotide reductase and involved in oxygen activation
chemistry.56

Intercalation of Ni2+ and Co2+ into birnessites
via ion-exchange leads to more effective electrochemical water oxidation
over materials made by substituting cations in the lattice of octahedral
sheets.27,28 A hypothesis was proposed that both Co2+ and Ni2+ can promote interlayer water ordering
that is facilitating the electron transfer process necessary for the
catalysis. With intercalated Cu cations, binding to neighbor oxygen
atoms and elongation of the Mn–O bond have been proposed.26

Comparison with Literature
Even
with the same polymorph
of manganese oxides, different water oxidation measurement systems
can demonstrate different catalytic activities.57 The manganese oxides reported in the literature using the
Ru(bpy)32+–persulfate photochemical system
and with measurement of dissolved oxygen are listed in Table 4. These measurements of dissolved
oxygen are typically carried out in the time frame of minutes.

It is difficult to
compare different studies even if they are using
similar Ru-based photocatalysis because of experimental parameters,
such as differences in light intensity and surface area of the catalysts.
We synthesized Mn2O3 following a previous experimental
procedure;23 the XRD is shown in Figure S16 and a TOF of 1.02 mmolO2 molMn–1 s–1 was found, compared to the literature report of 0.37 mmolO2 molMn–1 s–1. This shows that despite the same catalyst system, the performance
of manganese oxides between different studies in the literature will
differ (the light intensity in ref (23) was lower than in the present experiments).
Fe(IE)MnOx_400 exhibited the most active, stable, and robust water
oxidation activity with a TOF of 9.3 ± 0.7 mmolO2 molMn–1 s–1, and has the best results so far compared to the literature (Table 4).

Another way
to standardize the catalytic activity is to compare
with colloidal IrO2 as the benchmark.5 Colloidal IrO2 (6.2 × 10–4 M) was compared with the best performing Fe(IE)MnOx_400, with a
TOF of dissolved oxygen of 7.3 × 102 mmolO2 molIr–1 s–1. The catalytic activity of IrO2 and the performance of
colloidal IrO2 were better by a factor of 79 as shown in Figure 7a.

Figure 7 (a) Photocatalytic activity
(dissolved oxygen measurement) of Fe(IE)MnOx_400
and colloidal IrO2 (dissolved oxygen measurement in 80.0
mL of 2.7 mM borate buffer, pH = 8.50, 0.11 mM Ru(bpy)3Cl2·6H2O, 0.02 M Na2S2O8, 0.1 M Na2SO4, 0.5 mL of IrO2 added to 79.5 mL, catalyst normalized to 1 mg Mn) and (b)
photocatalytic activity (headspace oxygen by GC) of Fe(IE)MnOx_400
and colloidal IrO2 (40.0 mL of 2.7 mM borate buffer, pH
= 8.50, 0.11 mM Ru(bpy)3Cl2·6H2O, 0.02 M Na2S2O8, 0.1 M Na2SO4, 0.5 mL of IrO2 added to 39.5 mL,
catalyst normalized to 1 mg Mn).

Analysis of oxygen in the headspace was also carried out
to evaluate
catalytic activity. These measurements typically last tens of minutes
until the photosensitizer Ru(bpy)32+ decomposes.
The results of headspace oxygen with Fe(IE)MnOx_400 as measured by
gas chromatography (GC) is shown in Figure 7b. The TOF of oxygen evolution was 0.71 mmolO2 molMn–1 s–1. Under the same condition, for 0.5 mL of colloidal IrO2 (6.2 × 10–4 M), the TOF of oxygen evolution
of colloidal IrO2 was 52.3 mmolO2 molIr–1 s–1. The
performance of colloidal IrO2 was better by a factor of
∼74 in GC measurement as well, similar to dissolved oxygen
measurement (the cost difference between these two oxides is 3400).

Conclusions
Fe3+ ion-exchanged into a disordered-birnessite
KMnOx
led to destruction of the stacking of the layers, creating local disorder
and randomness in the stacking of layers. The ion-exchanging process
introduces Fe3+ cations into birnessite without losing
its core “MnO6” structural integrity, as
suggested by Raman analysis. The AOS of Mn was unchanged with Fe3+, and close to +3.3 to 3.5 in all samples, and the morphology
was comparable to KMnOx, consisting of ∼100 nm primary particles.
Fe(IE)MnOx was found to be significantly more catalytically active
as compared to KMnOx under similar photolysis conditions. For example,
the best Fe(IE)MnOx had a TOF of 9.3 ± 0.7 mmolO2 molMn–1 s–1, as compared to 3.2 mmolO2 molMn–1 s–1 for KMnOx. Fe(IE)MnOx
was also a robust catalyst and could be recycled. Comparison of Fe(IE)MnOx
with other manganese oxides reported in the literature indicates that
it performed significantly better, though comparisons between studies
with different experimental conditions are fraught with issues. The
better catalytic activity of Fe(IE)MnOx is not solely because of the
disordered layers, as Ga3+ exchanged KMnOx, which also
disrupted the stacking order was not as catalytically effective. We
propose that the interaction between the Fe3+ in the interlayers
and the MnO6 in the framework could be playing a role.
This study provides new insight into how redox active cations can
influence the structure–function role of disordered birnessite.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
All chemicals purchased were of analytical
grade and used without further purification. Manganese(II)acetate
tetrahydrate (Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Iron(III)nitrate nonahydrate [Fe(NO3)3·9H2O] was purchased from Malinckrodt.

Synthesis
Synthesis
of KMnOx
Mn(CH3COO)2 (60 mM) and KMnO4 (40 mM) were added together in 50 mL
deionized water and stirred for 1 h at room temperature. There was
an immediate color change and formation of a dark brown precipitate.
The brown suspended solution was centrifuged, and the precipitate
was collected discarding the supernatant. The precipitate was washed
several times and dried in vacuum, and designated as KMnOx.

Synthesis
of Iron(III)-Containing Material (Fe(IE)MnOx)
The as-prepared
KMnOx sample was dispersed in 10 mL of deionized
water, and treated with different concentrations of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O for 1 h at room temperature. The
concentrations of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O used for ion-exchanging were 5, 50, 200, and 400 mM, and they were
designated as Fe(IE)MnOx_5, Fe(IE)MnOx_50, Fe(IE)MnOx_200, and Fe(IE)MnOx_400,
respectively. The samples were washed several times and dried in vacuum
at room temperature.

Characterization
Powder XRD
Powder
XRD patterns were obtained using
a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ
= 1.5405 Å) radiation with 0.5 divergence, 0.02 step size, and
1.0 s dwell time.

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy
was done with
a Renishaw–Smith Detection IR-Raman Microprobe, model-inVia.
A 785 nm-laser line was used for the acquisition of the spectra with
laser power of 13 mW (50 s dwell time, 20 scans). Precautions have
to be taken during Raman spectra acquisition to preserve sample integrity,
including the choice of wavelengths (785 nm preferable to 514.5 nm)
and use of a spinning cell.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
XPS spectra were obtained
using a Kratos Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Al
Kα source (12 kV, 10 mA). The region scans were acquired using
20 eV pass energy and the survey scan was obtained using 80 eV. All
peaks were calibrated with respect to the C 1s peak position at 284.7
eV.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
The morphology of the
samples was characterized by FEI Helios Nanolab 600 dual beam focused
ion beam/scanning electron microscopes. Electron beams with 5 kV potential
and 0.17 nA current were used.

Surface Area Measurement
A Nova 2200e Surface Area
Analyzer was used to determine the surface area of the samples. Prior
to degassing, the samples were stored in a vacuum dryer at room temperature.
The samples were degassed under vacuum at room temperature for 24
h. They were degassed at room temperature in order to maintain the
structural integrity of the MnOx samples. Multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area analysis was carried out employing the N2 adsorption isotherm of the samples.

Elemental Analysis
For elemental analysis, the cold
digestion method was adopted to prepare solubilized samples. In a
Teflon bottle, 30 mL of mixed HF, HCl, and HNO3 (1:1:1
ratio) was mixed. The MnOx materials (30–50 mg) were added
to the acid solution. After dissolution, 75 mL of 0.86 M boric acid
was added to neutralize HF. Deionized water was added to the solution
so that the total solution weighs 100 g. Manganese and iron loading
in the birnessite was determined using AAS using a Shimadzu AA-7000
atomic absorption spectrophotometer.

Determination of Average
Oxidation State of Mn in KMnOx
The Mn AOS of KMnOx was determined
with the oxalic acid–permanganate
back-titration method. KMnOx (200 mg) was dissolved in 5 mL of 0.5
M oxalic acid and 10 mL of 1.0 M H2SO4 in order
to reduce Mn in KMnOx into the Mn2+ oxidation state. The
excess oxalic acid was back-titrated with standardized KMnO4 solution at 75 °C to obtain the AOS of Mn.

Photocatalytic
Water Oxidation
Dissolved Oxygen Measurement
In
a glass reactor, sodium
persulfate (0.02 M) (Sigma-Aldrich), sodium sulfate (0.1 M) (Fischer
Scientific), tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium chloride (6.7 mg)
(Sigma-Aldrich), and appropriate amount of powder catalyst (containing
1 mg of Mn) was added to 80 mL of borate buffer (pH 8.5). The solution
inside the reactor was sealed and purged with N2 gas for
20–30 min while stirring until the baseline reads 0.00–0.02
ppm O2 reading with a fluorescence probe. After N2 purging, the reactor was illuminated with visible light using a
Hg lamp equipped with a dichroic mirror (360 mW/cm2 intensity
measured at the sample cell). For the measurement of dissolved oxygen
evolution, a YSI instrument fiber optic dissolved oxygen (YSI ProODO)
sensor was used. The electrode was calibrated by the two-point calibration
method (zero for nitrogen saturated water and 9.5 ppm air-saturated
water).

GC Measurement
In a glass reactor, sodium persulfate
(0.02 M) (Sigma-Aldrich), sodium sulfate (0.1 M) (Fischer Scientific),
tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium chloride (6.7 mg) (Sigma Aldrich),
and appropriate amount of powder catalyst (containing 1 mg of Mn)
was added to 40 mL of borate buffer (pH 8.5). The solution inside
the reactor was sealed and purged with N2 gas for 20–30
min while stirring. After N2 purging, the reactor was illuminated
with visible light using an Hg lamp equipped with a dichroic mirror
with 360 mW/cm2 intensity measured at the sample cell.
A GC SRI 310 chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector
and a 13X packed molecular sieve column was used for GC detection.
The carrier gas used was helium, and the oxygen evolution in the headspace
of glass reactor was measured.
