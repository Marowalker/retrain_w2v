Platinum, being the most efficient
and stable catalyst, is used in
photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices. However, a minimal amount of Pt
with maximum catalytic activity is required to be used to minimize
the cost of production. In this work, we use an environmentally friendly,
cost-effective, and less Pt-consuming method to prepare PEC devices
for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Pt monolayer catalyst
is selectively deposited on a Au-nanoisland-supported boron-doped
p-type Si (100) photocathode. The PEC device based on the Si photocathode
with an ultralow loading of the Pt catalyst exhibits a comparable
performance for the HER to that of devices with a thick Pt layer.
In addition, we demonstrate that by using a thin TiO2 layer
deposited by atomic layer deposition photo-oxidation of the Si photocathode
can be blocked resulting in a stable PEC performance.

Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting
technology effectively
meets the challenge of producing inexpensive and greenhouse-gas-free
energy. Recently, a tandem cell PEC device for direct water splitting
achieved a record efficiency of 14%.1 The
major requirement to obtain efficient and stable tandem-based PEC
devices is to engineer different active parts (photoelectrodes, co-catalysts,
and stabilization layers) with an optimal contribution from each one.

Semiconducting materials such as silicon used as photoelectrodes
in PEC devices have no or very little catalytic activity; as a result,
they cannot directly convert photogenerated electrical energy into
chemical energy.2 This issue is typically
solved by covering the surface of the photoelectrode with a co-catalyst,
which accelerates the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER).3,4 However, surface structuring of Si is also used to enhance the photocatatlytic
activity of Si photoelectrodes.5 It is
estimated that the catalyst will contribute 10% of the total production
cost of a PEC device when noble metals are used as the catalytic material.6 To reduce the device fabrication costs an alternative,
low-cost, and abundant material or a feasible procedure for catalyst
deposition that consumes a reduced amount of the expensive catalyst
needs to be designed. Different non-noble-metal-based catalysts, such
as transition metal-based phosphides and sulfides as well as metal
chalcogenides, have been developed for the HER.7 These materials need overpotentials of about 50 mV at a
current density of 10 mA/cm2 for the HER. However, metal
sulfides can work efficiently only in acidic media, whereas metal
phosphides can be used in electrolytes, within a wide range of pHs.
However, the low stability of these catalysts is still a major hindrance
for their successful application in PEC devices. State-of-the-art
catalysts, such as CoP and Ni2P, are not stable during
long-term operation. The transition metal-based phosphides have a
lower exchange current density than that of the traditional Pt HER
catalyst and hence a higher amount of catalyst material on the photocathode
is needed to obtain a lower overpotential. Conversely, the use of
an excess amount of catalyst material can result in a decreased current
density due to the parasitic absorption of illuminated light on it.
Besides the material costs, the synthesis of metal sulfides and phosphides
requires multiple steps and also involves the use of dangerous and
poisonous gases (phosphine, sulfur).7 Multiple
production steps also complicate the fabrication process of the PEC
devices. To date, no single material has been developed that matches
the performance (efficiency and stability) of the Pt catalyst for
HER in different electrolyte media. Therefore, Pt is supposed to be
the best choice for HER in PEC technology.8

For effective PEC water splitting, the amount of Pt catalyst
needed
for PEC devices is supposed to be around 180 tons/year.9 However, the abundance of Pt on earth does not
allow the use of such a large amount. Nonetheless, a similar HER activity
(HER overpotential of around 50 mV) can be achieved by using thin
films or nanoparticles of other catalytic materials, such as metal
phosphides and sulfides. However, these kinds of catalyst are not
stable compared with bulk noble catalyst Pt; therefore, to realize
a stable and efficient catalyst, it is necessary to use a minimal
amount of this precious catalyst to achieve an equivalent catalytic
effect compared to that of the bulk Pt. Among the various approaches,
atomic layer deposition (ALD) is the most promising process to get
ultralow loadings of Pt nanoparticles on the photoelectrode.10,11 A Pt monolayer can also be deposited by the galvanic exchange method
on Au islands supported Si12,13 for PEC water splitting.

In this work, we demonstrate a fluorine-free method to produce
a Pt monolayer on Au-nanoisland (Au-NI)-supported Si photoelectrodes
for the HER. The Au-NI template is prepared by an inexpensive physical
vapor deposition technique and thermal quenching, which avoids the
use of typically chosen fluorine-based electrolytes or expensive lithography-based
processes for the template of Au nanostructures on Si.12,13 Furthermore, our approach can change the nanostructure by varying the parameters of
film deposition and quenching. The Pt monolayer is then deposited
on Au-NI by a galvanostatic exchange process. We found that the same
catalytic activity shown by Si PEC devices with a thin Pt layer can
be achieved when using only a Pt monolayer in the Pt/Au-NI/Si PEC
device. Moreover, the Pt monolayer does not show any parasitic effect,
which could contribute to the higher photocurrent density of the Si
photocathodes. Conclusively, the method used in this work is activity-efficient,
environmentally friendly, and less Pt-consuming; hence, it is cost-effective.

Results
and Discussion
The maximum performance of Pt with minimal
loading can be obtained
by its nanostructuring, and this can be done by depositing an ultrathin
layer of Pt on nanostructured non-noble metals on photoelectrodes.
Therefore, in the present study we fabricated Au-NI on boron-doped
p-type Si, which was subsequently used as a template for Pt layer
deposition. The Au-NI template for the deposition of the Pt monolayer
prepared by thermal Au evaporation and subsequent thermal quenching
was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) (Figure 1). The surface morphology measurements of the as-deposited
Au film on Si in Figure 1a,c show that the Au layer is compact, with certain pinholes. The
Au layer surface has an average roughness of around 6 nm (Figure 1a), and the reason
for this smooth film could be the deposition of Au under high vacuum
conditions. The Au-NI formation after the thermal quenching is confirmed
in Figure 1b,d.14 Layers by quenching are around 70 nm in diameter,
with an average distance of 150 nm between the islands and an average
height of the islands of around 15 nm; these dimensions are in agreement
with the literature values.15

thermal quenching at 500 °C for 2 min (b, d), measured by SEM
(a, b) and AFM (c, d) techniques.

Annealing at high temperature may result in the formation
of gold
silicide at the Au/Si interface, which affects the photoelectric properties
of the Si photoelectrode. The formation of the Au/Si interface was
studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on the Au/Si and
Au-NI/Si systems (Figure 2a,b). The Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 peaks
are located at binding energies of −84.1 and −87.9 eV,
with full width at half-maximum (FWHM) values of 1.1 and 1.2 eV, respectively
(Figure 2a), confirming
that the deposited Au film is indeed metallic.16 The peak position of the Au 4f7/2 level is shifted
by only 70 meV to a higher binding energy after the heat treatment
and formation of Au-NI on Si. This small shift indicates that there
is no formation of gold silicide at the Au/Si interface otherwise
the shift would be expected to be around 1.1 eV due to the sd hybridization
between Au and Si by charge transformation from the Au d orbital to
the Si s orbital.17,18 Both Au 4f peaks of the Au-NI
data show an increase in the FWHM of ∼80 meV compared to that
of the as-deposited Au/Si (Figure 2a). However, this slight increase is within measurement
accuracy. We suppose that the formation of gold silicide is hindered
due to the presence of native SiO2 between the Si and Au
layers. The presence of an intermediate SiO2 layer is evident
from the core-level Si 2p XPS spectra in Figure 2b at a binding energy ∼103 eV, which
corresponds to Si4+ states.

(Au/Si, black lines) and thermally quenched (Au-NI/Si, red lines)
Au/Si. The Si 2p peak intensity is normalized to the intensity at
−99.3 eV in (b). The inset in (b) compares the absolute intensities
of Si 2p of Au/Si and Au-NI/Si. Scheme of the Au film deposition and
subsequent formation of Au-NI (c).

Figure 2b
shows
the normalized Si 2p core-level XPS spectra before and after quenching
of the Au/Si stack. The Si 2p peak (Si0) intensity of Au/Si
is lower than that of Au-NI/Si due to the attenuation of the Si 2p
core electron in the Au film on Si, as shown in the inset (Figure 2b). After thermal
quenching (i.e., Au-NI/Si), the intensity of the Si 2p peak increased
because of the formation of well-separated Au-NI on Si accompanied
by reduced signal attenuation compared to that of the Au film on the
Au/Si stack. Hence, the formation of Au-NI on Si without gold silicide
formation is confirmed from the morphology and spectroscopic analyses
shown in Figures 1 and 2. A schematic diagram of the Au film deposition
and subsequent formation of Au-NI on Si upon quenching is shown in Figure 2c.

Finally,
the Pt monolayer is deposited on Au-NI/Si by a combination
of the Cu underpotential deposition (UPD) and galvanic exchange deposition
methods. The Cu2+ from the electrolyte is deposited as
Cu0 on Au at an applied potential of 0.2 V (Ag/AgCl). The
deposition of Cu using UPD on Au-NI/Si can be confirmed from XPS analysis
of the Cu/Au-NI/Si system. The Cu 2p core-level XPS spectra (Figure 3a) of the Cu deposited
by the UPD method on Au-NI/Si have a low intensity, where the signal-to-noise
ratio is very low due to the deposition of only a very little amount
of Cu. The Cu 2p3/2 peak position at −932.2 eV and
the absence of a shake-up satellite peak at around −942.0 eV19 show that the Cu is metallic after its UPD on
Au-NI/Si. After the galvanic exchange of Cu by Pt, the Pt 4f XPS core
levels were recorded (Figure 3b). The Pt 4f XPS spectrum possesses coincidence with the
binding energy range of Au 5p1/2 (−74 eV) along
with contributions from Au 4f shake-off satellites (labeled as Au
4fα3, α4), increasing the complexity
of its analysis. However, after the deposition of Pt, the Pt 4f7/2 peak intensity at −72.6 eV increases distinctly,
which can be understood as the substitution of Cu by Pt, resulting
in the transition from the Cu/Au-NI/Si system to the Pt/Au-NI/Si system.
The Pt peak position at −72.6 eV further suggests that the
Pt monolayer exhibits Pt2+ states.20 This finding is confirmed by the Pt 4d5/2 level at −316.4
eV (inset in Figure 3a).21 The weaker signal of Pt 4f in the
XPS data indicates that the thickness of the Pt overlayer on Au-NI/Si
is around 1 nm.

The deposition of metal nanoislands
on Si may also change the reflectance
of the surface or increase the light absorption of the incident light;
as a result, the PEC performance of the Si photocathode may deteriorate.
Therefore, we studied the surface reflectance of these samples using
ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy (Figure 4). Bare Si has a
reflectance of about 40% in the visible wavelength (450–800
nm), whereas for the as-deposited Au/Si, a reflectance of 60% is observed
in this region. In contrast, Au-NI/Si and Pt/Au-NI/Si exhibit a relatively
comparable reflectance with respect to that of bare Si.

Figure 4 UV–vis
spectroscopy of bare Si (gray line), Au/Si (black
line), Au-NI/Si (red line), and Pt/Au-NI/Si (green line), showing
the surface reflectance of these photocathodes.

To prove the concept of using a thin Pt monolayer on Au-NI/Si
for
the HER, different photocathode architectures, such as Si, Au/Si,
Au-NI/Si, Pt/Au-NI/Si, and Pt/Si, were tested and compared, as shown
in Figure 5. First,
the influence of the Au layer on the Si photocathode performance is
investigated (Figure 5a). The bare Si photocathode has an onset potential of around −620
mV (Figure 5a, gray
line). The higher cathodic onset potential is due to the generation
of a lower open circuit potential, which is governed by the band edge
position of Si with respect to the redox potential; the noncatalytic
property of Si photoelectrodes is also responsible for this higher
cathodic potential.22,23 The Au film deposition on Si
does not improve the photocatalytic properties, as Au is catalytically
inactive for the HER.24 Rather, the Au
film on Si decreases the photocurrent density (Figure 5a, black line) due to the higher light reflectance,
as shown in Figure 4 (compare the gray with black line therein). Moreover, the interface
between Au and Si can contribute to the lower current density than
that of the bare Si.

Figure 5 LSV in 0.1 M H2SO4 under illumination
(solid
lines) and in the dark (dotted lines) is performed on Si (gray line),
Au/Si (black line), and Au-NI/Si (red line) (a), and Si (gray line),
Pt/Au-NI/Si (green line), thin-EC-Pt/Si (Pt deposited by the electrochemical
method for a shorter time, navy blue line), and thick-EC-Pt/Si (Pt
deposited by the electrochemical method for a longer time, orange
line) (b).

However, the formation of nanoislands
by thermal treatment of the
Au film on Si (Au-NI/Si) results in similar reflectance to that of
bare Si (Figure 4,
red and gray lines). This fact might be partially supported by the
similar LSV data in Figure 5a (red line), even though more parameters, such as interface
properties and co-catalyst, effect the LSV characteristic. In comparison
to those of the bare Si electrode, the Au-NI/Si photocathode shows
a similar current density and has an onset potential shift toward
the anodic direction of ∼100 mV.

The LSV of bare Si and
Pt-decorated Si are compared in Figure 5b. After the deposition
of the Pt nanolayer on Cu/Au-NI/Si by the galvanic exchange method,
the Pt/Au-NI/Si photocathode (Figure 5b, green line) shows a large shift of the onset potential
of around 500 mV toward the anodic direction in comparison to that
of the bare Si electrode (Figure 5b, gray line). At a current density of −10 mA/cm2, the overpotential of Pt/Au-NI/Si for the HER decreased by
700 mV with respect to that of the bare Si photocathode. This decrease
shows that Pt delivers an effective catalytic enhancement even with
very low loading on the nanoislands. Although Pt/Au-NI/Si shows a
slightly higher reflectance (Figure 4, green line) than that of bare Si (Figure 4, gray line), the photocurrent
densities of these structures are comparable. It should be noted that
the reflectance cannot be directly related to the current density
as the catalytic effect of the co-catalyst and the charge separation
at the photoelectrode–electrolyte interface play important
roles in the photocurrent density as well. Therefore, the resulting
current density could be due to the catalytic effect of the Pt overlayer
on the nanoislands, but also other factors may contribute. Here, we
would like to mention that although the XPS shows Pt is in the 2+
oxidation state the LSV shows an even stronger catalytic effect. The
catalytic effect of Pt2+ could be due to the coupling of
the catalyst on the photocathode. Also, Pt2+ suppresses
the back reaction in the electrochemical medium to block the oxidation
of the H+ ion, which results in a higher HER activity.25,26 Hence, a further check of the Pt oxidation states after the HER
with XPS is required to clarify this point. However, in this article,
the minimal use of Pt was the main focus and no additional analytical
study of the Pt oxidation state was done. The performance of reference
photocathodes prepared by Pt nanoparticle deposition on Si by the
electrochemical method (thin-EC-Pt/Si and thick-EC-Pt/Si) is also
included in Figure 5b, and it was found that thin-EC-Pt/Si and Pt/Au-NI/Si have similar
photocatalytic activities. This comparison of two different kinds
of samples shows that with a significantly smaller amount of Pt co-catalyst
on the nanoislands the same catalytic activity can be obtained on
Si photocathodes. Consequently, this fact confirms that consumption of a minimized amount of Pt
facilitates maximal performance. Moreover, an excess amount of Pt
on Si can also reduce the current density due to the absorption of
incident light by the Pt overlayer on Si. This can be observed in
the data on the thick-EC-Pt/Si reference sample (Figure 5b, navy blue line), for which
the photocurrent density is reduced due to the absorption of light
by the Pt overlayer on Si. This is avoided in the Pt/Au-NI/Si photocathode.
At this point, it should be emphasized that for an efficient Pt co-catalyst
coated Si photocathode the optimization of size and coverage of Pt
particles is still necessary, as both influence the photocatalytic
activity of the Pt/Si photocathode.27

The long-term stability of the produced photocathodes
under operating
conditions was examined using the chronoamperometry test with visible
light illumination. Figure 6 shows the corresponding results of Si, Pt/Au-NI/Si, Pt/Au-NI/Al2O3/Si, and Pt/Au-NI/TiO2/Si at an applied
potential of −1.2 V (RHE) for 10 h. In the upper panel of Figure 6, the Si and Pt/Au-NI/Si
photocathodes show an almost constant photocurrent density up to 3.5
h of illumination, followed by a decrease from −20 to −15
mA/cm2 within the next 6.5 h of testing. The decrease in
photocurrent density could be due to the surface oxidation of Si by
the evolved O2 or photocorrosion.28 For PEC stability of Si photoelectrodes, their surfaces must be
protected against any kind of photocorrosion or oxidation. Si photoelectrodes
can be protected against PEC degradation by coating them with metal
oxide ALD layers.28−30 Therefore, we use either Al2O3 or TiO2 ALD layers for the protection of the Si photoabsorber
against PEC degradation. The lower panel in Figure 6 shows that the use of the thin metal oxide
ALD layer indeed results in stable photocurrent density during 10
h of experiments. The thickness of the ALD layer is normally restricted
to ∼4 nm to ensure the flow of the photogenerated charge carriers
through the protecting layer. An even longer stability of the photocathode
can be achieved by the use of a “leaky” thicker TiO2 protection layer,30,31 whereas for Al2O3, the applicable thickness is limited to the
aforementioned value due to the increasing insulating behavior with
increasing thickness.28

The chronoamperometry test is carried out at an applied potential
of −1.2 eV (RHE) in 0.1 M H2SO4 under
visible light illumination. The upper panel shows the current density
vs time curve for Si and Au-NI/Si, whereas the lower panel shows the
current density vs time curve of TiO2- and Al2O3-protected Pt/Au-NI/Si photocathodes.

Conclusions
Our study has shown
that the cost-effective, hazard-free, and nontoxic
preparation method based on the combination of UPD and galvanic exchange
using a Au-NI template on the Si photocathode results in an effective
reduction of the catalyst loading while retaining the PEC performance
for the HER achieved with a highly Pt-consuming method. Au-NI is used
here as a template to deposit Pt in the form of a nanostructure. Furthermore,
by changing the Au-NI size, the Pt island size can be changed to optimize
the PEC performance of Pt/Au-NI/Si. The dimension of the Au-NI template
can be further changed by varying the thickness of the Au intermediate
layer and by thermal quenching. Moreover, the Au template is prepared
here without the help of a masking process or the fluorine-based electroless
deposition process. Hence, these results may strikingly contribute
to the use of a minimized amount of Pt and variability of the Pt decoration
on Si in the final PEC tandem device fabrication on the one hand and
to the prolongation of the availability of the Pt material on the
other hand. Moreover, we demonstrated that an ALD interlayer can be
used to stabilize the photoelectrodes decorated with Pt/Au-NI against
PEC degradation.

Experimental Methods
The Pt monolayer
was deposited on p-type Si combining UPD and galvanic
exchange methods. For UPD, the Si was first coated with Au-NI. Prior
to the deposition of Au, the boron-doped Si wafer (resistivity of
10–20 Ω cm) was diced into 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 pieces and cleaned with isopropanol, acetone, and deionized water
under constant sonication for 5 min each to remove surface contaminants.
The p-type Si pieces always contained native SiO2 layers.

The Au deposition was carried out in high vacuum at 10–7 mbar using a Knudsen cell for evaporation. Au with a film thickness
of about 8 nm was deposited on Si. Au-NI on Si (Au-NI/Si) was fabricated
by applying thermal shock (thermal quenching) to the Au/Si stack,
where the sample was subjected to heat treatment of 500 °C for
2 min at 10–5 mbar and then cooled to room temperature
(RT).

The Au-NIs were used as the template for Pt monolayer
deposition.
Here, in the first step the Au-NI/Si stack was covered with a monolayer
of Cu using UPD.32 The Cu UPD was carried
out in a solution of 50 mL of 1 mM CuSO4 and 50 mM H2SO4 electrolyte at a potential of 0.2 V (Ag/AgCl)
for 60 s. In the next step, the Pt monolayer was deposited on Au-NI/Si
by simultaneous deposition of Pt onto and removal of Cu from the Au-NI
surface.33 The Pt deposition was carried
out by a galvanic exchange process at the open circuit potential for
3 min in a 30 mL solution of 10 mM K2PtCl4 and
0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte.

For comparison, Pt layers
were deposited on Si and Au-NI/Si by
an electrochemical route. A cathodic potential of −200 mV was
applied to deposit Pt on Si and Au-NI/Si using a solution of 0.1 M
K2PtCl4 and 0.5 M NaCl.34 The thin and thick layers of Pt were
deposited by varying the time of deposition, and the thickness of
the film was dependent on the electrodeposition time. For the thin
film (i.e., thin-EC-Pt), the deposition was performed for 180 s, whereas
the thick layer (i.e., thick-EC-Pt) was deposited by increasing the
deposition time to 600 s. After 600 s, an optically visible thick
layer of Pt was formed.

Topography measurements were performed
at RT by atomic force microscopy
using a Veeco CP-II AFM system in a contact mode.

SEM images
were recorded with a FEI Quanta 250 FEG high-resolution
scanning electron microscope operated at 20 kV.

The depositions
of Au, Cu, and Pt were checked by elemental analysis
using XPS in ultrahigh vacuum (3 × 10–9 mbar).
A Specslab analyzer and Mg Kα X-ray source with a photon energy
of 1253.6 eV were used. The spectral data were collected at a step
width of 0.1 eV and a pass energy of 20 eV.

The total reflectance
spectra were recorded in the wavelength range
from 200 to 900 nm using a Varian Cary 4000 spectrophotometer with
a diffuse reflectance accessory; an incident beam was directed at
3°20′ angle with respect to the sample normal.

The
electrochemical and PEC experiments were carried out in a three-electrode
bottom-cell system. A VERSTAT4 potentiostat was used to perform the
electrochemical measurements, whereas Pt (wire), Ag/AgCl, and Si were
used as the counter, reference, and working electrodes, respectively.
For the characterization of the photoelectrodes, a light lamp from
Euromex Illuminator EK1, with a light intensity of 40 mW cm–2 at the wavelength of 580 nm, was used. The current–voltage
measurements were performed using LSV, with a sweeping speed of 50
mV s–1 in 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte.

To enhance the stability of the photoelectrodes, ALD layers of
TiO2 and Al2O3 were deposited in
a home-built shower-head-type ALD reactor.35,36 Both TiO2 and Al2O3 were deposited
by a thermal ALD process, and the thicknesses of these layers were
around 4 nm.
