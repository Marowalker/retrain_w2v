Removal of
nitrogen oxide pollution has attracted much attention, and photocatalysis
is considered as an effective method to treat polluted gas. Currently,
modified semiconductors with approximate band gap are used as visible-light-driven
photocatalysts. Herein, this is the first investigation of photocatalytic
removal of NO under visible light over Cr-doped ZnO nanoparticles
(Cr–ZnO NPs). Furthermore, the trapping species experiment
and electron spin resonance measurement were conducted to identify
the primary reactive factor of the photocatalytic reaction. In this
study, Cr–ZnO NPs were synthesized by the sol–gel method
with a narrow band gap, enhanced NO photocatalytic degradation performance,
low NO2 conversion yield, and high stability under visible
light.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Nowadays, the development of industries
has led to increased emission of polluted gases into the air environment.
Nitrogen oxide is one of the most popular emissions from factories
and vehicles that is harmful for human, animals, and plants.1 In the environment, nitrogen oxide plays a role
in producing acid rain, photochemical smog, and ozone destruction.2,3 Among many methods to remove nitrogen oxide, photocatalysis is considered
as a “clean” and efficient approach.4,5 Among
traditional and emerging photocatalysts such as TiO2, SnO2, Cu2O, g-C3N4, ZnO, Bi2WO6, BiPO4, etc.,6−12 ZnO exhibited superior properties such as unique optical and high
chemical stability, as well as easy synthesis.13−15 However, ZnO has a large band gap (about
3.3 eV at room temperature); therefore, its photocatalytic activity
is not really prominent in the visible light region.16−18 In the literature, there are
many approaches to narrow the band gap, such as formation of oxygen-deficient
structure, loading metal onto ZnO, and doping nonmetal or metal into
ZnO,19−22 of which Cr doping into ZnO could be advantageous
because Cr3+ can easily substitute the Zn2+ position,
narrow the band gap, establish the magnetic property, etc.23,24 Recently, Li et al. have indicated that Cr3+ doping resulted
in the generation of narrow band gap of SrTiO3 and in efficient
decomposition of NO upon irradiation by low-intensity light.25 Wu et al. fabricated Cr–ZnO by the solvothermal
method and indicated that the as-synthesized Cr-doped ZnO nanowires
were a somewhat promising photocatalyst in remediation of water.26 Also, by the solvothermal method, Meng et al.
used Cr–ZnO NPs with different Cr3+ contents, which
is a somewhat novel and high-efficiency absorbent for the removal
of acidic dye methyl orange from aqueous solution.27

There are many methods to synthesize Cr–ZnO
NPs, such as solvothermal,27 hydrothermal,28 microwave-assisted,29,30 coprecipitation,31 combustion,32 magnetron
sputtering,24,33 and sol–gel,34 of which the sol–gel route is considered
as a facile and efficient approach compared to the others. The advantages
of the sol–gel method include short synthetic time, use of
green chemicals, low-cost synthesis, high-purity products, and ease
of synthesis on the industrial scale.35−38

In this study,
Cr–ZnO NPs have been synthesized by the sol–gel route
and the NO degradation photocatalytic activity has been investigated
under the visible light range. This is the first systematic study
on the investigation of NO degradation photocatalytic activity. Moreover,
the stability, photocatalytic mechanism, and NO2 yield
have been discussed in this study.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Chromium(III) nitrate nonahydrate
(Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, 99%), zinc nitrate
hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O,
99%), citric acid (C6H8O7, 99%),
potassium iodide (KI, 99.99%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA; C3H8O, 99.99%), potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7, 99.99%), 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO; C6H11NO, 99%), sodium
sulfate (Na2SO4, 99.9%), and deionized water
(DI) were used as received without further treatment.

2.2 Preparation of Cr-Doped ZnO Nanoparticles
Cr–ZnO NPs were synthesized via the sol–gel method
by adding 4.46 g of Zn(NO)2·6H2O and 0.06
g of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O into 60 mL
of 1 M citric acid solution. After that, the sol solution was obtained
after stirring the mixture for 1 h at 80 °C and dried at 135
°C for 3 h to make a xerogel. Finally, the product was calcined
at 400 °C for 5 h.

2.3 NO Photocatalytic Degradation Measurements
Photocatalytic
activity of samples was evaluated by measuring the photocatalytic
degradation ability of NO gas, at the concentration of 480 ppb, in
a continuous flow reactor at ambient temperature, 70% of humidity
level, and 3 L/min flow rate under visible light irradiation (300
W xenon lamp with a UV cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm)). In detail,
0.20 g of photocatalysts was prepared by coating their aqueous suspension
onto a glass dish (d = 12 cm), and after the catalyst
achieved adsorption/desorption equilibrium, the lamp was switched
on. Finally, the NO and NO2 concentrations were measured
after 30 min using a chemiluminescence NOx analyzer (model 42c, Thermo Environmental Instruments).

In
the result analysis, the removal ratio of NO (η) and the conversion
of NO2 (ψ) over different photocatalysts were calculated
from eqs 1 and 2. 1   2  where C is the NO concentration of the outlet at
any one time, C0 is the initial concentration
of NO, and CNO2 is the production
of NO2.

2.4 Characterization of Materials
The crystalline structures
of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker
D8 Advance 5005 diffractometer system. The morphology of samples was
characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM,
S-4800 at 10.0 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL
JEM–1400 at 100 kV). Moreover, the lattice fringes of the as-prepared
material were examined by selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
patterns. The oxidation state and chemical compositions were analyzed
by XPS (K-Alpha, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) mapping, respectively. The optical band gap properties were
determined by UV–vis diffuse absorption spectroscopy (DRS)
using a Jasco V-550 UV/VIS spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL)
spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin
Yvon, Nanolog) at room temperature using excitation wavelength of
325 nm. To identify the main factor responsible for photocatalytic
activity, KI, IPA, and K2Cr2O7 were
used as effective scavengers of hole (h+), hydroxyl radical
(•OH), and electron (e–), respectively.
In addition, DMPO was used as a radical spin-trapped reagent for ESR
to confirm the production of short-lived reactive radicals of materials,
such as superoxide anion radical (DMPO–•O2–) in methanol
and hydroxyl radical (DMPO–•OH) in the aqueous
state, under light-off and visible light-on for 6 min. The photocurrent
of materials was controlled using an electrochemical workstation (BioLogic
SP-240) with three electrodes including a Pt wire counter electrode,
an Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode, and the working electrode
of as-synthesized materials in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte
under visible light condition (100 mW/cm2 of 150 W xenon
lamp).

3 Results
and Discussion
XRD patterns (Figure 1a) show that the as-synthesized materials,
including ZnO NPs and Cr–ZnO NPs, exhibited diffraction peaks
consisting of the standard diffraction pattern of the hexagonal wurtzite
structure of ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451). In addition, no secondary phases
existed in the XRD patterns of the Cr–ZnO NPs. However, Figure 1b shows that the
typical peaks of the (002) and (101) planes of ZnO were shifted slightly
to larger diffraction angels when Cr was doped into ZnO. This is because
the ionic radius of the Cr3+ ion is smaller than that of
the Zn2+ ion; therefore, it can easily penetrate and replace
the original Zn atom of the host lattice, resulting in deformation
of the ZnO lattice. Besides, according to previous publications, Cr
easily replaces Zn in the ZnO lattice leading to a strong absorption
in the visible-light region because of the intraband transition of
the Cr 3d bands and the conduction band (CB).39−41 In addition, the morphology of the Cr–ZnO
NPs shown in Figure 1c represents the spherical-like shape of the Cr–ZnO NPs with
approximately 13–20 nm in diameter. Moreover, SAED diffraction
patterns confirmed that the Cr–ZnO NPs exhibit well-defined
crystallinity, as shown in Figure 1d. It is noteworthy that the prominent rings in the
SAED patterns of Cr–ZnO NPs are consistent with the (100),
(101), and (002) lattice planes of the wurtzite phase of ZnO.

Figure 2a shows the
EDX spectrum of Cr–ZnO NPs, indicating the existence of Zn,
O, and Cr atoms; herein, the content of Cr atoms in the sample is
1.38 wt % and 1.03 atom %. In addition, the surface of Cr–ZnO
NPs (Figure 2b) is
surveyed by EDX elemental mapping to determine the presence of atoms
in the sample. Results confirmed the existence of Zn, O, and Cr atoms
with their distribution as shown in Figure 2c–e, which demonstrates that Cr doped
successfully into ZnO lattice.

image (b), and the corresponding
EDX elemental scanning maps (c–e) of Cr–ZnO NPs.

To gain insight into the existence
as well as oxidation states of as-synthesized materials, the XPS results
were analyzed. The presence of Zn and O elements is observed in all
samples, and the signal of Cr is detected in Cr–ZnO NPs as
shown in Figure 3a.
It is clearly observed that in the high-resolution XPS (HR-XPS) spectra
of the Zn 2p region (Figure 3b), there are two symmetric peaks at binding energies (BE)
of 1021.3 and 1044.4 eV for ZnO NPs, corresponding to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 states, indicating a normal state of Zn2+ in the material.42 However, the
positions of these peaks in Cr–ZnO NPs are slightly shifted.
In detail, the BE values of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 are located at 1022 and 1045 eV, respectively. This could be attributed
to the substitution of Zn2+ by Cr3+, and an
added Zn–O–Cr binding energy,43 which is consistent with the XRD pattern results (Figure 1b). At a high content of Zn,
the Cr 2p region overlaps strongly with Zn LMM Auger peaks.44,45 As shown in Figure 3c, the peaks centered at 577.1 and 585.9 eV correspond to Zn LMM
states of ZnO. However, typical peaks of Cr3+ were observed
at 576.3 and 585.3 eV, which can be assigned to Cr 2p3/2 and Cr 2p1/2, respectively. Clearly, the presence of
Cr3+ has shifted the Zn LMM position to lower BE in the
Cr–ZnO sample.33,44,45Figure 3d shows the HR-XPS
spectra of O 1s of all doped and undoped samples. It could be fitted
by a Gaussian distribution (Table 1) and shown that the asymmetric O 1s core spectrum
deconvoluted with three peaks. The first peaks centered at ∼530
eV can be attributed to the coordination of O2– ions
in the wurtzite ZnO lattice (Zn–O) (OL). Meanwhile,
the peaks at ∼531 and 532 eV are attributed to O– in the oxygen-deficient regions/oxygen vacancy (OV)43,46 and the O2– ion of chemisorbed oxygen (Oads) on the surface, respectively.33,43 It is noteworthy
that the percentage of OV in Cr–ZnO NPs is higher
than that of ZnO NPs (Table 1). It suggests that the oxygen vacancies on the as-synthesized
ZnO NPs surface increased after doping, which could be partly explained
via the band gap results.

For the optical properties, Cr is
successfully doped into ZnO, and the DRS and PL spectra are obtained. Figure 4 shows that the absorption
edge of the Cr–ZnO NPs is red-shifted from a wavelength of
400–450 nm compared to the undoped ZnO (Figure 4a). Thus, we can conclude that the light
absorption range of Cr–ZnO NPs had transferred to the visible-light
region. Besides, the optical band gaps of the ZnO NPs and Cr–ZnO
NPs were estimated to be 3.1 ± 0.2 and 2.76 ± 0.2 eV, respectively,
as shown in Figure 4b. The emission of Cr–ZnO NPs is also compared to that of
ZnO NPs by the recognition of PL spectra (Figure 4c). This indicates that the appearance of
emission peaks in the 600–620 and 385–400 nm regions
contributes to the donor states (Cr3+ and OV) and the band-to-band transition of materials, respectively. The
intensity of typical peaks of Cr–ZnO NPs is lower than that
of ZnO NPs, contributing to capture of donor states leading to an
increase in the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes,
resulting in a higher photocatalytic performance.47−49 To confirm the efficient photoresponse ability
of Cr doping into ZnO, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of ZnO NPs
and Cr–ZnO NPs with 0.5 M Na2SO4 (Figure S1, Supporting Information) indicated
the difference in the current density under dark and visible light
condition; therein, the Cr–ZnO NPs can greatly influence the
current density. Further, the photocurrent density–time curves
of materials were measured and are shown in Figure 4d. It is found that the photocurrent density
of Cr–ZnO NPs (achieved 4.4 μA/cm2 at −0.3
V vs VAg/AgCl) is approximately 14.7 times
higher than that of ZnO NPs (0.3 μA/cm2 at −0.3
V vs VAg/AgCl) under visible-light irradiation.
Besides, the photocurrent density of Cr–ZnO NPs is kept stable
after five light-on/light-off cycles. The combination of the PL and
photocurrent density indicated that the Cr doping into ZnO has enhanced
the separation and transfer the photogenerated charges.50

reflectance spectra (a), band gap
determination from Tauc plot (b), photoluminescence spectra (c), and
photocurrent density–time curves of ZnO NPs and Cr–ZnO
NPs (d).

The NO photocatalytic degradation of Cr–ZnO
NPs is shown in Figure 5a. The results show that the NO photocatalytic removal over ZnO and
Cr–ZnO NPs occurs quickly in the first 5 min, then decreases
slightly, and finally reaches saturation for all of the catalysts
after 30 min of visible light irradiation. The NO photocatalytic degradation
efficiency of Cr–ZnO NPs achieved 24.44%, which was significantly
higher than that of ZnO NPs (about 17.6%). Additionally, the stability
of the Cr–ZnO NPs was tested via the recycling test with five
repeat cycles. Figure 5b shows that the Cr–ZnO NPs have good stability, indicating
that the NO degradation efficiency remained almost unchanged after
five cycles. Moreover, the XRD patterns of as-synthesized Cr–ZnO
after five cycles of photocatalytic test are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), which indicate
that the positions of all typical diffraction peaks of both samples
are unchanged and the intensity of these peaks is slightly decreased.
The combination of the photocatalytic ability of the recycling test
and the XRD results demonstrates that the Cr–ZnO NPs have a
good stability. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood model51 was used to describe the rate of the NO photocatalytic
degradation of the materials. The initial photocatalytic degradation
of NO gas was recognized to follow first-order kinetics; then, the
obtained results are displayed by a linear plot of ln(C/C0) versus reaction time in Figure S3a (Supporting Information). The result
shows that the reaction rate (k) of the Cr–ZnO
NPs is 1.74 times higher than that of ZnO NPs. Besides, Figure S3b (Supporting Information) shows the
NO degradation efficiency and NO2 yield conversion of materials.
Results show that the NO degradation efficiency over Cr–ZnO
NPs is higher than that of undoped ZnO NPs and the NO2 yield
conversion is lower than that of undoped ZnO (7.5% for Cr–ZnO
NPs and 17.3% for ZnO NPs). This demonstrated that Cr doping into
ZnO not only improves the NO removal ability but also decreases the
generation of NO2 gas. Thus, Cr–ZnO NPs can be potential
material for real-time application.

degradation activity of materials under visible light (a); recycling
photocatalytic test of Cr-doped ZnO NPs (b); comparison of NO degradation
efficiency (c) and photocatalytic reaction rate (d) in the presence
of scavenger; and DMPO-ESR spectra of Cr-doped ZnO NPs (e).

To clarify the NO photocatalytic
degradation mechanism under visible light, trapping experiments were
conducted to identify the active radical species. Figure 5c shows that the NO degradation
photocatalytic activity of Cr–ZnO NPs decreased with the addition
of scavengers. Furthermore, the NO degradation efficiency of Cr–ZnO
NPs decreased from 24.44 to 15.18, 20.43, and 16.50% with the addition
of KI, IPA, and K2Cr2O7, respectively.
This result indicated that the photocatalytic activity of Cr–ZnO
NPs was contributed by h+, •OH radicals,
and e–. However, the photocatalytic reaction rate
(Figure 5d) indicated
that the presence of IPA made the NO photocatalytic decomposition
reaction rate the lowest. This means that •OH plays
a primary role in the NO degradation ability of Cr–ZnO NPs
via intermediate reactions. Furthermore, the DMPO-ESR results (Figure 5e) of the Cr–ZnO
NPs indicated no signal in the dark. However, under visible light,
the signals appeared clearly, demonstrating the existence of •O2– and •OH radicals. Moreover, both in H2O and under light-on conditions, the strong signals prove that there
are several •OH radicals that conform to the trapping
test.

Based on the above results, a proposed mechanism of the
photocatalytic activity of Cr–ZnO NPs for NO degradation under
visible light is shown in Figure 6. First, the Cr–ZnO NPs are excited and electrons
and holes are generated by visible light irradiation. Second, the
photogenerated electrons generated in the valence band (VB) of the
material transfer to the CB of the material or back and forth to the
donor states (eq 3).
Third, these electrons can either transfer to the surface of Cr–ZnO
NPs or reduce adsorbed O2 or oxygen gas to yield •O2– superoxide
radical anions (eq 4).
Meanwhile, holes in the VB of Cr–ZnO NPs move to surface and
oxidize OH– radicals to yield •OH radicals (eq 5).
During the reaction process, •O2– produces •HO2 hydroperoxyl (eq 6) and •HO2 radicals produce hydroxyl
radical •OH (eqs 7–10). Finally, both •O2– and •OH will react and degrade NO and NO2 to NO3– (eqs 11 and 12). As the trapping experiment results have concluded
that •OH radicals are important (Figure 5c), in this step, •OH radicals will promote the photocatalytic activity of materials.52−55 3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12

4 Conclusions
In summary,
uniform spherical-like Cr–ZnO NPs with 13–20 nm diameter
were synthesized via the sol–gel method. The results show that
the Cr–ZnO NPs have good NO photocatalytic degradation activity
(24.44% for 30 min under visible light), low NO2 conversion
yield, and high stability, as indicated in five measurement cycles
with trivial change in performances. Moreover, •OH radical, the main active radical, was identified via trapping
test and ESR analysis. The above-mentioned properties will open a
promising application of Cr–ZnO NPs in visible-light-driven
photocatalysis.
