Biobased, elastomeric
polymer poly(glycerol succinate-co-maleate) (PGSMA)
was produced using a “green” synthesis
with added cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) to create a novel PGSMA–CNC
material. PGSMA–CNC was synthesized with the aim of developing
a new strategy for successfully dispersing CNCs within a poly(lactic
acid) (PLA) matrix for optimal reinforcement of tensile strength and
modulus while having the added benefit of the proven toughness enhancements
of PLA/PGSMA blends. Optical microscopy and fractionation in tetrahydrofuran
showed that CNCs agglomerated during PGSMA–CNC synthesis and
remained in agglomerates during PLA/PGSMA–CNC reactive blending.
Fourier transform infrared, differential scanning calorimetry, and
dynamic mechanical analyses also showed that PGSMA–CNC inhibited
the formation of PGSMA crosslinks and PLA-g-PGSMA
during reactive blending. These two effects resulted in loss of impact
strength and only a 4% increase in tensile modulus over PLA/PGSMA
at the highest CNC content. Further work in preventing CNC aggregation
could help improve mechanical properties of the final blend.

Introduction
Increasing numbers
of consumers and corporations alike are opting
to move away from petroleum-based products and toward products that
are made using renewable resources and/or can be recycled or composted
at their end of life. This motivates research into development of
new biobased and compostable materials that can compete with and replace
petroleum-based plastics in a variety of applications. Poly(lactic
acid) (PLA) is a compostable thermoplastic polyester that can be synthesized
from renewable resources. PLA is one of the most promising biobased
and biodegradable polymers for competing with petroleum-based plastics
because of low production cost, good mechanical properties (Young’s
modulus ∼3 GPa), good thermal properties (melting temperature
of ∼170 °C and glass-transition temperature of ∼60
°C), and good optical properties.1,2 However, its
brittleness (evidenced by very low elongation at break and poor impact
strength) limits its use in applications requiring higher toughness
and flexibility.3,4 Thus, there has been much research
interest in using a variety of methods to improve the properties of
PLA.

PLA is commonly toughened by compounding with plasticizers
or impact
modifiers or by blending with soft/rubbery polymers.1,2,4 Melt blending coupled with extrusion
is the most widely used processing method for producing plastics on
an industrial scale, as this is the most convenient and economical
technique.5 Improvement in elongation at
break and impact strength of PLA has been achieved by melt blending
with a variety of different soft polymers.6−8 Melt blending
soft polymers with PLA is even more effective when combined with a
reactive extrusion process in which a radical initiator is used during
melt blending. This creates compatibilizing graft polymers between
the soft polymer and PLA and creates a cross-linked phase of the soft
polymer. This technique has been used in previous research by Valerio
et al. on poly(glycerol succinate-co-maleate) (PGSMA)
as a toughness enhancer for PLA.9,10 In this work, reactive
blends of 20 wt % PGSMA with PLA showed improved elongation at break
and impact strength.9 The use of PGS and
PGSMA has the added benefit of being a partially biobased blend.11,12

Although melt blending of PLA with soft polymers can yield
dramatic
improvements in elongation at break and impact strength, there is
a corresponding decrease in tensile strength because of the incorporation
of a soft phase.1 Another strategy for
improving PLA toughness involves the incorporation of rigid fillers
to counteract a loss in stiffness (however, the incorporation of fillers
will also correspond to a decrease in elongation at break).1 The right filler can also further increase toughness
by enhancing PLA crystallization.13 For
example, the addition of nanoclay to PLA/poly-(butylene succinate)
(PBS) blends increases the tensile strength from 1.08 to 1.94 GPa
while decreasing the elongation at break from 71.8 to 3.6%, but using
an epoxy-functionalized organoclay that was able to react with terminal
carboxylic acid groups of PLA and PBS gave a composite with high tensile
strength and elongation at break of 118%.14 A good filler must be able to provide increased stiffness while
being compatibilized to minimize losses in elongation at break. Cellulose
nanocrystals (CNCs) have been studied by a variety of researchers
as a reinforcing filler for PLA and other plastics. CNCs can dramatically
increase the tensile strength of a composite at small loadings and
have a large amount of surface hydroxyl groups that can be used for
compatibilizing reactions with PLA and other blended polymers.15 CNCs are of particular interest for PLA composites
because they are a plant-based reinforcing filler and thus produce
fully biobased composites with PLA. PLA–CNC nanocomposites
have been prepared using surfactant-modified CNCs through melt extrusion
followed by film formation, resulting in a composite with a 600 MPa
increase in Young’s modulus over neat PLA.16 PLA/surface-acetylated CNC nanocomposites have also been
prepared that exhibited dramatic increases in tensile strength and
modulus over neat PLA, obtaining an 150% increase in Young’s
modulus with a loading of 10 wt % acetylated CNCs.17 CNCs have also been previously used by Medeiros et al.
as a reinforcement for PGSMA films that resulted in 20 and 40% improvements
in tensile strength and Young’s modulus, respectively.18

Despite the significant improvements in
mechanical properties CNC
reinforcement can produce, there are challenges incorporating them
into polymer blends. The high proportion of surface hydroxyl groups
on CNCs lend a strong tendency to hydrogen-bond with other CNC molecules,
forming agglomerations rather than a dispersion of nanocrystalline
cellulose.19 Processing techniques that
keep CNCs in solution have shown promise in maintaining dispersion,20 such as film casting from solvent evaporation
or melt compounding combined with liquid feeding.21

In this work, an attempt to improving the tensile
strength and
modulus of toughened PLA/PGSMA blends by the addition of CNCs is explored
while utilizing a new method to prevent CNC agglomeration during extrusion
processing of the composite. Research by Dorris and Gray found that
CNC suspensions could be formed in glycerol with minimal agglomeration.22 Here, a suspension of CNCs in glycerol is used
in the synthesis of PGSMA to form PGSMA–CNC, which is then
used in reactive melt blending with PLA. Ideally, this method would
keep the CNC well dispersed during the melt processing, as it is introduced
via the soft PGSMA. There is also the potential for reactions between
PGSMA and CNC that could work to better compatibilize CNC with PLA
for optimized reinforcement.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of PGSMA–CNC
PGSMA–CNC was
synthesized using a 1:0.75:0.25 glycerol/succinic acid/maleic anhydride
molar ratio with 1, 3, and 5 wt % CNC added. This composition of PGSMA
monomers was used because it was previously determined to yield the
best mechanical properties in a PLA/PGSMA blend.9,10 The
reaction was stopped before the gel point, as the liquid PGSMA polymer
has been determined in previous studies to be better dispersed in
the PLA matrix and thus give better toughening of PLA.9 The product mixture contains some impurities in the form
of unreacted monomers (because the reaction must be stopped before
completion to prevent gelation from extensive cross-linking).

CNCs possess a reactive surface due to the presence of free hydroxyl
groups. These groups are frequently used to surface-modify CNCs, allowing
for better dispersions and interactions with hydrophobic polymer matrices.23,24 One of the many reactions that hydroxyl groups of CNCs can take
part in is with carboxylic acid groups at terminal ends of polyesters
to form ester linkages. Espino-Pérez et al. have previously
detailed the surface grafting of aromatic carboxylic acids (benzoic
acid, phenylacetic acid, and benzyl acetic acid) onto CNCs (CNC-g-CA) via an ester linkage using reaction conditions similar
to those needed in the synthesis of PGSMA.25 It is feasible that the carboxylic acid-terminated branches of growing
PGSMA polymers may react with CNC hydroxyl groups to produce PGSMA-g-CNC. It is also possible that the CNCs simply disperse
within a matrix of PGSMA, possibly forming hydrogen bonds with terminal
hydroxyl groups on PGSMA branches. Because of the low concentration
of CNCs added, the reaction of succinic acid, maleic anhydride, and
glycerol to produce PGSMA is more likely to occur than any side reactions
between CNC and succinic acid or maleic anhydride. Thus, any PGSMA–CNC
interactions will be limited to dispersed sections of long PGSMA chains
and the product mixture referred to in this article as “PGSMA–CNC”
will contain some neat PGSMA molecules as well as PGSMA–CNC.
This is why Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of PGSMA–CNC
(see Figure 1) shows
the same signals as those in the spectra of neat PGSMA: The signal
from the small amount of any potential new PGSMA–CNC bonds
is too weak. The only noticeable change in the spectra is a slight
change in the broad hydroxyl peak at ∼3425 cm–1 in PGSMA–5%CNC, which can be attributed to increased hydroxyl
signals due to increased CNC content.

Figure 1 Comparison of FTIR Spectra of PGSMA with
varying content of in
situ CNCs.

To better determine the presence
of any new bonds in PGSMA–CNC,
the polyester was fractioned in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Neat PGSMA
is fully soluble in THF, whereas CNC is not, leaving an insoluble
“gel”. PGSMA–3%CNC and PGSMA–5%CNC left
a gel fraction much larger than the weight percent of CNC (17.72 ±
2.85 and 11.09 ± 0.17% respectively; see Table S1), suggesting that the gel fraction is composed of
some PGSMA as well as CNC. Therefore, there must be some sort of interaction
between PGSMA and CNC (either hydrogen bonding or formation of PGSMA-g-CNC), which modifies some PGSMA so that it is no longer
soluble in THF. It is also interesting to note that PGSMA–5%CNC
has a lower gel content than that in PGSMA–3%CNC, despite PGSMA–5%CNC
having a higher CNC content. This could be explained by increased
agglomeration of CNCs in PGSMA–5%CNC, as agglomerations of
CNCs would have reduced surface area to react with PGSMA, reducing
the amount of insoluble PGSMA-g-CNC formed and thus
the insoluble gel content. Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra in two key regions of the PGSMA–CNC
gel fraction compared to those of CNC and PGSMA. The primary functional
group in CNC is the OH group, producing a distinctive broad peak in
the range of 3400 cm–1 with three smaller peaks
visible within (3483, 3439, and 3336 cm–1). A distinctively
shaped, broad OH peak at 3425 cm–1 is observed in
the spectra of PGSMA. The other primary functional groups in PGSMA
are the C=O (present in ester linkages and terminal carboxylic
acids), producing a sharp peak at 1718 cm–1; the
C=C, producing a smaller peak at 1643 cm–1; and the C–O stretch, producing a sharp peak at 1153 cm–1. The FTIR spectra of the PGSMA–3%CNC and PGSMA–5%CNC
gel fractions show a broad peak containing three smaller peaks at
exactly the same wavenumbers this is observed in the spectrum of neat
CNC (Figure 2a). The
C=O peak is still present at a slightly higher wavenumber than
observed in neat PGSMA (Figure 2b). This suggests that the terminal carboxylic acids of PGSMA
may have formed ester linkages with CNC surface hydroxyl groups, thereby
altering the C=O environment and producing a signal at a higher
wavenumber. Figure 3 shows the proposed reaction scheme between PGSMA and CNC.

Reactive Extrusion Blending
of PGSMA–CNC and PLA
The synthesized PGSMA–CNC
with varying CNC content was blended
with PLA to create the different composites outlined in Table 1. The use of maleic anhydride
in addition to succinic acid as monomers in PGSMA synthesis creates
a polyester with C=C double bonds, allowing for the use of
a radical initiator during blending with PLA. The formed free radicals
could attack C=C bonds on PGSMA, creating macroradical PGSMA,
which can either react with other macroradicals to form cross-linked
PGSMA or abstract hydrogens from PLA to form PLA-g-PGSMA copolymers (Figure 4).9,26,27 It is also
possible that a transesterification between PLA and PGSMA ester groups
may occur or an esterification reaction between terminal OH and COOH
groups on PLA or PGSMA may occur. However, these reactions have been
found to occur mostly in the presence of a catalyst with much higher
residence times; thus, it is unlikely that they occur to a significant
extent.28−30 The use of a radical initiator has also previously
been used to compatibilize PLA–CNC nanocomposites by forming
CNC-g-PLA through a reactive extrusion under temperatures
and residence times similar to those in this study.31,32 However, the total concentration of CNCs in the PLA/PGSMA–CNC
blend is at most 1 wt %; thus, the PLA-g-PGSMA grafting
reactions are much more likely to be favored.

reactive extrusion of PLA and PGSMA–CNC.

Figure 5 shows the
FTIR spectra of PLA/PGSMA–CNC reactive blends. The spectra
of the blended polymers show the same characteristic peaks as those
of PLA with the addition of a small, broad hydroxyl peak at 3480 cm–1. The spectra remain the same with the increasing
CNC content, and only a slight change in the hydroxyl peak in the
PLA/(PGSMA–3%CNC) and PLA/(PGSMA–5%CNC) spectra due
to signals from dispersed CNC is observed (Figure 5a). The PLA/PGSMA–CNC blends were
fractioned in THF to determine the extent of cross-linking due to
the radical initiator. PLA, PLA-g-PGSMA, and uncrosslinked
PGSMA are soluble in THF, whereas cross-linked PGSMA and CNCs are
not, leaving an insoluble “gel”.9 Therefore, this gel will consist of cross-linked PGSMA, CNCs, and
PGSMA–CNC polymers. By weight percent, PLA/PGSMA and PLA/(PGSMA–1%CNC)
were found to have the largest gel content of ∼9 wt % and PLA/(PGSMA–3%CNC)
and PLA/(PGSMA–5%CNC) had a gel content of ∼3 wt % (Table S1). A gel content of ∼9 wt % is
in agreement with gel fractions obtained for reactive PLA/PGSMA blends
without CNC in previous works by Valerio et al.9,10 A
gel fraction of ∼3 wt % is still higher than the total CNC
content in the blend (0.6–1 wt %) but much less than the typical
gel content of reactive blends without CNC. This suggests that there
is some PGSMA cross-linking adding to the insoluble PGSMA–CNC
fraction, but PGSMA–CNC could be somewhat inhibiting radical-initiated
PGSMA cross-linking, resulting in a smaller gel fraction. In previous
work by Valerio et al., the small shoulder peak at ∼1643 cm–1 (corresponding to C=C bonds) is less intense
in the FTIR spectra of reactive PLA/PGSMA blends than in the FTIR
spectra of neat PGSMA because of the disappearance of PGSMA double
bonds during cross-linking.10 This peak
does not decrease noticeably in the spectra of PLA/(PGSMA–3%CNC)
or PLA/(PGSMA–5%CNC) (Figure 5b), which also suggests that PGSMA–CNC is inhibiting
cross-linking. Furthermore, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA, Figure 6) shows that PLA/PGSMA–CNC
has a lower first glass-transition temperature (∼4 °C
compared to 10.98 °C in reactive PLA/PGSMA without CNC). A higher
glass-transition temperature has been correlated with increased cross-linking
density in poly(glycerol sebacate) polyesters and in PGSMA, suggesting
that there is less PGSMA cross-linking in PLA/PGSMA–CNC compared
to that in PLA/PGSMA.33,10

Figure 5 FTIR spectra of 80/20 PLA/PGSMA blends
with varying CNC content:
(A) ∼3000 cm–1 region showing a broad hydroxyl
peak and (B) ∼1700 cm–1 region showing a
sharp C=O peak and C=C shoulder.

Figure 6 DMA traces showing Tg1 of 80/20 PLA/PGSMA–CNC
blends with varying CNC content (noted (a)–(d) in the figure).

The formation of PLA-g-PGSMA molecules has previously
been shown to cause the appearance of a secondary PLA melting peak
in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves at a lower temperature
because of the formation of imperfect PLA crystals.34,10 This peak can be seen as a shoulder on the PLA melting peak at ∼159
°C on the DSC curve for the PLA/PGSMA reactive blend (see Figure 7). This shoulder
is also present with a similar intensity in the PLA/(PGSMA–1%CNC)
blend (Figure 7), suggesting
that PLA-g-PGSMA molecules are being formed in PLA/PGSMA–CNC
blends as well. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of PLA/PGSMA–CNC
blends processed with and without a radical initiator (Figure 8) further supports that there
is some graft polymer formation, as there is a noticeable compatibilization
between PLA and PGSMA–CNC phases when using the radical initiator
(the PLA/PGSMA–CNC blend created through reactive extrusion
shows a much more uniform surface with smaller particle sizes of the
dispersed PGSMA phase, as was also seen in previous work by Valerio
et al.).9 As CNC content increases, PLA-g-PGSMA formation appears to be inhibited, as evidenced
by the disappearance of the PLA melting peak shoulder in the DSC curves
for PLA/(PGSMA–3%CNC) and PLA/(PGSMA–5%CNC) (Figure 7). Furthermore, FTIR
analysis of the insoluble gel fraction from PLA/(PGSMA–3%CNC)
(Figure 9) shows a
single peak at 1722 cm–1 corresponding to the C=O
groups in cross-linked PGSMA. However, in the work by Valerio et al.,9 the FTIR spectra of the gel fraction of PLA/PGSMA
reactive blends showed a small shoulder evident on the C=O
peak, which is deconvoluted into signals for PGSMA and PLA C=O
functionalities, indicating the presence of PLA-g-PGSMA (PLA-g-PGSMA polymers are soluble in THF,
but if PGSMA participates in PGSMA cross-linking as well, the PLA
fragment will remain in the insoluble gel fraction, resulting in a
PLA C=O signal in the gel fraction FTIR spectrum). Because
this PLA signal is not evident in the PLA/PGSMA–CNC gel fraction
FTIR spectra (Figure 9), this reinforces that PLA-g-PGSMA formation is
inhibited in higher-CNC-content PLA/PGSMA–CNC blends.

Morphology
In SEM photos (Figure S1) of PLA/PGSMA–CNC blends, it is possible to differentiate
between two separate phases (the PLA matrix and dispersed PGSMA particles),
but it is less easy to see any indication of dispersed CNCs (usually
observed as white dots). Furthermore, there is minimal change in morphology
with increasing CNC content (Figure S1).
From atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, it is again possible to
see a good dispersion of PGSMA within neat PLA, as evidenced by the
small, uniform holes left by pulled-out PGSMA–CNC (Figure S2). However, there is no indication of
a high-modulus CNC polymer (Figure S3).
This could be the result of CNC particles only staying in the PGSMA
phase and thus being pulled with PGSMA, or due to the fact that the
amount of CNC is small and potentially agglomerated and not well dispersed,
it may be present only in small areas not imaged during AFM or SEM.
To better determine the dispersion of CNC within PGSMA and whether
agglomeration had occurred, optical microscopy of the PGSMA–CNC
alone was done to determine the dispersion of CNCs within the polyester
(Figure 10). CNCs
can easily be seen as large, white agglomerates, ranging in size from
10 to 20 μm wide by 10 to 50 μm long. As shown by previous
researchers,35,36,37 it is very difficult to successfully re-disperse CNCs by melt processing
(i.e., extrusion of dried CNCs with PLA). If optical microscopy shows
CNC agglomerations in PGSMA–CNC, it is very unlikely that these
agglomerations were broken up during extrusion and therefore would
still exist in the final PLA/PGSMA–CNC composite.

Figure 10 Optical microscopy
of (A) PGSMA and (B, C) PGSMA–3%CNC at
different magnifications.

From Figure 10,
the dispersion of CNC within the PLA/PGSMA–CNC composite is
not uniform. Because of a high surface area and the presence of many
−OH groups on CNCs, they have a strong tendency to hydrogen-bond
one another and form microscale agglomerations rather than a nanoscale
dispersion of crystalline cellulose.19 A
variety of processing techniques can be used when creating nanocomposites
with CNCs to avoid agglomeration: surface modification of CNCs,38,39 solvent casting, and liquid feeding during melt processing.24 Water-soluble polymer matrices or solution methods
are usually used to prepare nanocomposites with CNC.40 The use of powdered, freeze-dried CNCs dispersed in polar
glycerol by sonication was expected to give a stable suspension of
CNCs that could then be used for dispersing CNCs within a PGSMA matrix,
similar to the work of Medeiros et al.18 However, CNC has a tendency to agglomerate during drying, and it
is difficult to disperse these agglomerations.41 In the work by Khoshkava and Kamal, freeze-dried CNCs when
dispersed in water by sonication and then blended with polypropylene
produced a morphology of large, flakelike agglomerates, similar to
the dispersion observed from optical microscopy of PGSMA–CNC
(Figure 10).41 It appears that dissolving in a polar medium
(glycerol) with sonication is not enough to overcome hydrogen bonding
between CNC chains and disperse the nanocrystalline cellulose.

Effect
of Addition of CNC on Thermal and Mechanical Properties
of PLA/PGSMA Blends
The addition of CNCs to PLA typically
yields a composite with improved thermal stability over neat PLA.2,42 Here, increasing CNC content shows minimal change in the onset of
thermal decomposition over PLA/PGSMA (Figure S4). This lack of improvement in thermal stability could be due to
a lower CNC loading (largest increase in thermal stability typically
seen in composites with a higher CNC content2,42)
or due to poor interaction between CNC and PLA. The percent crystallinity
(as calculated from DSC first heating cycles) of PLA/PGSMA–CNC
blends increases slightly with increased cellulose content but only
by 6% from lowest to highest CNC content blends (Table S2). A slight increase in crystallinity is expected,
as both PGSMA droplets and CNC particles can act as heterogeneous
nucleating sites to increase the crystallinity of the composite.43,44 However, the small increase in crystallinity observed here is too
small to have any noticeable impact on mechanical properties of the
blend. This is in line with typical DSC results for PLA/CNC nanocomposites
(an increase in crystallinity but minimal change in glass-transition
temperature or melting temperature).42 Similar
results were also found by Bitinis et al. in PLA/natural rubber/CNC
composites.45

The addition of PGSMA
with no CNC causes a 27% decrease in tensile strength from neat PLA,
whereas giving a 27.7% increase in elongation at break and 57% increase
in impact strength (Table S3). This decrease
in tensile strength and modulus is expected, as adding PGSMA to PLA
is incorporating an amorphous polymer into a semicrystalline polymer
matrix.9 The increase in elongation at
break and impact strength is promising, as these two properties are
reflective of the blend’s toughness. With the addition of CNC,
the impact strength lowers from 35.90 J/m in PLA/PGSMA to 29.03 J/m
in PLA/(PGSMA–3%CNC) (the highest value out of the 3% CNC contents)
(Table S3). This decrease in impact strength
correlates with the observation that PGSMA cross-linking and PLA-g-PGSMA formation are inhibited in PLA/PGSMA–CNC
reactive blends, as the impact strength of reactive PLA blends has
shown to be dependent upon the extent of PGSMA cross-linking and formation
of PLA-g-PGSMA polymers in previous work by Valerio
et al.10 The effect of secondary polymer
cross-linking and PLA/secondary-polymer graft copolymer formation
on reactive PLA blends’ elongation at break and impact strength
has also been observed in research by Zhang et al.26 Tensile strength and modulus in PLA/PGSMA–CNC blends
remain close to their values in PLA/PGSMA, reaching the highest value
in PLA/(PGSMA–3%CNC) (although this is only a 10 and 4% increase
in strength and modulus, respectively). Elongation at break steadily
decreases with increasing CNC content, from 32% in PLA/PGSMA down
to 10% in PLA/(PGSMA–5%CNC) (Figure 11). In general, the incorporation of CNCs
into various polymer matrices results in an increase in tensile strength
and modulus and a decrease in the elongation at break, as observed
here, but the increase in tensile strength and modulus is expected
to be much larger.46−49

Figure 11 Mechanical properties of PLA/PGSMA–CNC reactive blends with
varying CNC content.

Mechanical properties of CNC nanocomposites can often be
much less
than theoretically predicted due to agglomeration of CNCs: The strongly
interacting surface hydroxyl groups of CNCs are what allow for their
impressive reinforcing effect by forming rigid load-bearing percolating
architectures for stress transfer.50 However,
surface hydroxyl hydrogen bonding also causes CNC agglomeration. The
commonly used CNCs isolated from wood pulp or cotton reach critical
filler content at a higher CNC concentration, and CNCs begin to agglomerate
at lower concentrations.50 In other studies
where mechanical properties of polymers were not improved by the use
of CNC,36,45,37,51,35 the nanocomposites
were prepared by melt mixing, whereas successful nanocomposites are
usually prepared by solution mixing methods or using surfactant-modified
CNCs, which are better at preventing CNC agglomeration because competitive
bonding with a hydrogen-bond-forming solvent (such as water) interrupts
CNC hydrogen bonding and aggregations.40 Because CNCs in PGSMA have obviously aggregated, there is minimal
effective reinforcing effect from the nanofiller to the composite.

Conclusions
The reinforcement of PLA/PGSMA blends with CNCs
by incorporating
CNCs into the synthesis of PGSMA was investigated. Dry CNCs suspended
in glycerol were added to the one pot, solvent-free synthesis of PGSMA,
and the resulting PGSMA–CNC was blended with PLA by a reactive
extrusion using a radical initiator. FTIR analysis of gel fractions
showed that CNC had reacted with PGSMA chains to form ester linkages
and hydrogen bonds between the two polymers. The reactive extrusion
of PGSMA–CNC and PLA leads to PGSMA cross-linking and formation
of PLA-g-PGSMA, although to a lesser extent than
that in reactive PLA/PGSMA blends without CNC. The decrease in graft
polymer formation and cross-linking correlates with the observed decrease
in impact strength in PLA/PGSMA–CNC blends. Optical microscopy
imaging confirmed the formation of CNC agglomerates in PGSMA–CNC
and PLA/PGSMA–CNC blends, explaining a lack of tensile strength
improvement due to CNC reinforcement. Future work will focus on using
new methods, such as solvent exchange from aqueous CNCs to a glycerol
suspension, to obtain a better dispersion of CNCs within PGSMA.

of CNCs (1, 3, and 5 wt %) were ground into a fine powder and then
dispersed in glycerol (100.0 g, 1.086 mol) by sonication for 6 h.
The weight percentage of CNCs was calculated as a fraction of the
predicted final mass of PGSMA using an estimated mass yield of 89%
based on yields obtained in previous PGSMA syntheses.9 The glycerol–CNC mixture was then combined with
succinic acid (90.0 g, 0.762 mol) and maleic anhydride (25.0 g, 0.255
mol) in a 1 L reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer (250 rpm),
heating mantle (150 °C), nitrogen gas flow, and a Dean-Stark
apparatus. Reaction progress was tracked by taking hourly viscosity
measurements in a cone plate rheometer at 100 °C and 100 s–1 (CAP 2000+, Brookfield). An initial synthesis was
performed in which viscosity measurements were taken every 30 min
until the material became an insoluble gel due to cross-linking (wrapping
itself around the mechanical stirrer). On the basis of this reaction,
it was determined that a viscosity of 300–500 P is the maximum
achievable viscosity to obtain non-cross-linked liquid PGSMA. Once
a viscosity in this range was reached, the reaction was stopped by
removing the vessel from the heating mantle. The final product was
a sticky, viscous, clear to opaque (depending on CNC content) yellow-white
liquid. This product was used as is without further purification.

Reactive Melt Blending of PLA and PGSMA–CNC
PLA and
PGSMA–CNC were blended by means of reactive extrusion.
PLA was dried in an oven overnight at 80 °C, and PGSMA–CNC
was kept in a plastic syringe heated to 85 °C with a syringe
heater (New Era, NY) to melt the material for dispensing. PLA (8 g),
PGSMA–CNC (2 g) (containing varying amounts of CNC: 1, 3, and
5 wt %), and a radical initiator (Luperox 101, 0.2 phr) were combined
in a twin-screw extruder (Xplore, DSM, Netherlands) at a processing
temperature of 180 °C and screw speed of 100 rpm. After 2 min
of extrusion, the blended material was collected in an injection device
heated to 180 °C and injected into molds for mechanical testing
specimens at 30 °C. The ratio of PLA/PGSMA–CNC (80/20)
and amount of radical initiator was used as it was determined to give
the best properties in previous work by Valerio et al.9

Mechanical Testing
All mechanical
testing was completed
40 h after processing, and results are the average of five specimens.
Flexural and tensile testing of polymer samples was performed using
an Instron universal testing machine (Instron, Canada) according to
ASTM D790 (flexural, 14.0 mm/min crosshead speed) and ASTM D638 (tensile,
50.0 mm/min crosshead speed, type IV specimens). Notched Izod impact
testing was completed using an impact testing machine equipped with
a 0.5–5 ft lbs hammer following ASTM D256. Impact samples were
notched immediately following processing.

Fractionation of PLA/PGSMA–CNC
Blends in Solvents
To determine the gel content of PLA/PGSMA–CNC
blends, a sample
of approximately 200 mg (mi) was dissolved
in 30 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 40 °C for 2 h (THF dissolves
the PLA and uncrosslinked fraction of PGSMA–CNC, whereas the
cross-linked gel portion and CNCs are insoluble). The solution was
then centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 rpm and washed again with 30 mL
THF. The recovered gel portion was dried for 5 h at 80 °C and
then weighed (mf). The gel fraction was
calculated as gel fraction (wt %) = (mf /mi) × 100.

FTIR Characterization
FTIR spectra of PGSMA–CNC,
PLA/PGSMA–CNC composites, and gel fractions were collected
in 64 scans at a resolution of 4 cm–1 using a Nicolet
6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with an attenuated total reflection
accessory.

Thermal Characterizations
Differential
scanning calorimetry
(DSC) traces were obtained for samples of ∼5 mg under a nitrogen
flow of 50 mL/min (DSC Q200, TA instruments). The materials were equilibrated
at −30.00 °C and then heated at a rate of 10.00 °C/min
to 180 °C, cooled at a rate of 10.00 °C/min to −30.00
°C, held for 2 min, and then heated again at a rate of 10.00
°C/min to 180 °C. The crystallinity percentage of the samples
was calculated from the first heating cycle using the following formula: Xc = (ΔHm –
ΔHcc)/ΔH100 × 100, where ΔHm and ΔHcc are the enthalpies of
melting and cold crystallization, respectively, and ΔH100 is the theoretical melting enthalpy of 100%
crystalline PLA (93 J/g).27,45 Thermal decomposition
was assessed using thermogravimetric analysis: 5–10 mg of sample
heated from room temperature to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min
under a nitrogen flow of 50 mL/min (TGA Q500, TA Instruments).

Dynamic
Mechanical Analysis
PLA/PGSMA–CNC samples
were equilibrated at −100 °C for 10 min and then heated
at 3 °C/min to 100 °C, applying a periodic deformation of
0.02% strain at 1 Hz in dual cantilever mode (Q800 DMA, TA instruments).
The storage (E′) to loss (E′) modulus ratio (tan δ) was plotted as a function
of temperature.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Scanning
electron microscopy
images of fractured impact specimens were taken using a Phenom ProX
scanning electron microscope (Phenom-World VB, The Netherlands). Before
imaging, the samples were coated with a thin layer of gold using a
sputter coater to prevent degradation during imaging.

Atomic Force
Microscopy
Samples were prepared at room
temperature using a Leica RM microtome (Leica Biosystems, Germany)
and analyzed using a Multi-Mode 8-HR atomic force microscope (AFM)
(Bruker, Santa Barbra) in tapping mode.
