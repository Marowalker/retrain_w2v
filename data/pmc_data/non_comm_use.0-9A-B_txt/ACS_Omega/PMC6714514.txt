The
clinical use of some drugs, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin,
and allopurinol, is often associated with adverse cutaneous reactions.
The bioactivation of drugs into immunologically reactive metabolites
by the liver is postulated to be the first step in initiating a downstream
cascade of pathological immune responses. Current mechanistic understanding
and the ability to predict such adverse drug cutaneous responses have
been partly limited by the lack of appropriate cutaneous drug bioactivation
experimental models. Although in vitro human liver models have been
extensively investigated for predicting hepatotoxicity and drug–drug
interactions, their ability to model the generation of antigenic reactive
drug metabolites that are capable of eliciting immunological reactions
is not well understood. Here, we employed a human progenitor cell
(HepaRG)-derived hepatocyte model and established highly sensitive
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analytical assays to generate
and quantify different reactive metabolite species of three paradigm
skin sensitizers, namely, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and allopurinol.
We found that the generation of reactive drug metabolites by the HepaRG-hepatocytes
was sensitive to the medium composition. In addition, a functional
assay based on the activation of U937 myeloid cells into the antigen-presenting
cell (APC) phenotype was established to evaluate the immunogenicity
potential of the reactive drug metabolites produced by HepaRG-derived
hepatocytes. We showed that the reactive drug metabolites of known
skin sensitizers could significantly upregulate IL8, IL1β, and CD86 expressions
in U937 cells compared to the metabolites from a nonskin sensitizer
(i.e., acetaminophen). Thus, the extent of APC activation by HepaRG-hepatocytes
conditioned medium containing reactive drug metabolites can potentially
be used to predict their skin sensitization potential.

1 Introduction
Cutaneous
adverse reactions to drugs administrated into systemic
circulation remains a severe problem because it can result in significant
morbidity and mortality such as Steven Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and
toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).1−3 Increasing evidence shows
that this type of cutaneous drug reactions is frequently associated
with the formation of reactive drug metabolites, which have been detected
in circulating human blood plasma of patients.4−7 It is postulated that these reactive
metabolites can act as antigens when bound to plasma proteins (i.e.,
a hapten), which in turn activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
in the blood circulatory system that will stimulate a cascade of downstream
cytotoxic effector immune responses to attack epidermal keratinocytes.8−11 However, there is a lack of reliable cellular experimental models
to mimic these different cellular processes, which hampers efforts
to understand and predict cutaneous drug reactions.

The in vitro
formation of immunogenic reactive drug metabolites
recapitulates an essential first step in modeling cutaneous drug reactions.
Reactive drug metabolites, such as 2 hydroxyl carbamazepine (2-OH
CBZ) and 3 hydroxyl carbamazepine (3-OH CBZ) from carbamazepine (CBZ),12 5-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin
(p-HPPH) from phenytoin (PHT),13 and oxipurinol
from allopurinol,14−16 are often generated during Phase I metabolism of
the parent compound by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and other enzymes
in the liver as either the primary or secondary metabolites. To date,
the bioactivation of paradigm skin-sensitizing drugs into their reactive
metabolites has only been demonstrated in rat microsomes or rat hepatocytes17 and human liver microsomes.18 Since the CYP enzymatic profiles are significantly different
between humans and animals, a human hepatocyte model would more reliably
recapitulate the metabolism of a potential skin sensitizer into its
constituent reactive metabolites.

HepaRG-hepatocytes (HepaRG-Heps)
are derived from a bipotent human
liver progenitor cell line and are increasingly being used as an alternative
to primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) due to their unlimited expansion
capacity and amenability to long-term in vitro culture.19,20 Importantly, HepaRG-Heps consists of several essential CYP enzyme
activities, which are responsible for generating the reactive metabolites
during drug bioactivation that could probably induce skin sensitization.21,22 To date, HepaRG-Heps have been extensively used to model drug metabolism
in the context of predicting hepatotoxicity and drug–drug interactions.
For example, paradigm skin sensitizers, such as carbamazepine,22 phenytoin,23 and
allopurinol,24 are being investigated using
HepaRG-Heps to discover their CYP induction potential and consequent
adverse drug–drug interactions.25,26 However, the
applicability of HepaRG-Heps in the generation of reactive drug metabolites
with functional readouts related to skin sensitization potential has
not been explored.

In this study, we established a HepaRG-hepatocyte
model and highly
sensitive accompanying liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS)
analytical assays to investigate the production of different reactive
metabolite species from paradigm skin sensitizers under varying medium
conditions. In addition, a functional assay, which was based on the
activation of U937 monocytes into antigen-presenting cell (APC) phenotypes27−29 was implemented to evaluate the immunogenicity potential of the
reactive drug metabolites produced by HepaRG-Heps to distinguish between
the three known skin-sensitizing drugs, namely, carbamazepine, phenytoin,
and allopurinol, from a nonskin-sensitizing drug (acetaminophen, APAP).

2 Results
2.1 Functional Characterization
of HepaRG-Derived
Hepatocytes
Increasing evidence suggests that reactive drug
metabolites are responsible for causing severe skin sensitization
reactions, such as SJS and TEN, which necessitates a need to develop
a cutaneous bioactivation model. Since HepaRG-derived hepatocytes
(HepaRG-Heps) have shown comparable metabolic functions to primary
human hepatocytes,19 we hypothesize that
they are capable of generating different skin-sensitizing drug metabolites,
which can be detected through highly sensitive LCMS analytical assays.

After 14 days of differentiation, the bipotent HepaRG progenitor
cells formed large cords of hepatocyte-like cells, which exhibited
the characteristic polygonal morphology of primary human hepatocytes
(PHHs), and were surrounded by biliary epithelial-like cells as shown
in Figure 1A.30 The identities of the 2 cell populations were
confirmed by the hepatic marker (CYP3A4) and biliary marker (CK19)
(Figure 1B). The derivation
efficiency of HepaRG-Heps in the cultures was approximately 50% as
reported by Cerec et al.31 The albumin
secretion of HepaRG-Heps could reach a comparable if not higher level
than that of PHH after the first 7 days of differentiation (Figure 1C). The average albumin
production rate of PHH was approximately 100 μg/day/106 cells, while that of HepaRG-Heps on days 7, 9, and 11 post differentiation
were 99 ± 30, 200 ± 50, and 109 ± 40 μg/day/106 cells, respectively (Figure 1C). This indicated that functional HepaRG-Heps could
be maintained in vitro for an extended period of time. The transcriptional
expressions of various liver-specific genes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, Albumin, HNF-4α, and PXR) were also similar to those of
PHH (Figure 1D).

(SEM) of three independent batches of differentiation. Data for PHHs
were average ± SEM of three different lots of cryopreserved PHHs.
Asterisks denote statistically significant differences (Student t-test, *p < 0.05).

Many of the known skin-sensitizing metabolites are products of
phase 1 metabolism mediated by CYP enzymes. Therefore, we also examined
the basal CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 activities of HepaRG-Heps by evaluating
the conversion of enzyme-specific substrates (phenacetin for CYP1A2
and midazolam for CYP3A4) into their metabolic products.32 The CYP1A2 activity of HepaRG-Heps was significantly
higher than that of PHHs (HepaRG-Heps: 36 ± 2.8 ng/mL/min/106 cells vs PHH: 23 ± 3.7 ng/mL/min/106 cells)
(Figure 1E). At the
same time, HepaRG-Heps also exhibited higher midazolam hydroxylation
activity catalyzed by CYP3A4 (105 ± 7.4 ng/mL/min/106 cells) than the PHHs (63 ± 11.9 ng/mL/min/106 cells)
(Figure 1F). By the
analysis of CYP enzyme-dependent substrate conversion, HepaRG-Hep
preserved higher major human-relevant CYP activities (CYP1A2 and CYP3A4)
compared to cultured PHH, which agreed with the gene expression results.
Collectively, our data indicated that we are able to consistently
generate functionally competent hepatocytes from a human progenitor
cell line, which would provide a stable bioactivation cell model to
study potential systemic skin sensitizers.

2.2 Generation
and Analytical Measurement of Reactive
Metabolites in Different Media
To examine the applicability
of the HepaRG-Heps as a cutaneous drug bioactivation model, we treated
HepaRG-Heps with three model drugs that are known to cause cutaneous
reactions, including carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (PHT), and allopurinol.
We also established LCMS analytical assays to quantify the production
of their antigenic reactive metabolites, including 2-OH CBZ, 3-OH
CBZ, 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (p-HPPH),
and oxipurinol (Figure 2A). The drugs were administered to the HepaRG-Heps in various medium
milieus to determine if their compositions may affect the detection
of the drug metabolites.

metabolites
in different media. (A) Schematics of the bioactivation of paradigm
skin-sensitizing drugs (i.e., CBZ, PHT, and allopurinol) by HepaRG-Heps
to metabolites. The metabolites generated by HepaRG-Heps in either
Krebs–Henseleit buffer (KHB), William E (WE), or RPMI after
6 h of incubation time were then quantified by an established liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) analytical assay. Generation

metabolites, hydroxyphenytoin, 5-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin
(p-HPPH) in 15 μM concentrations of PHT. (F) Generation of allopurinol’s
metabolites, oxypurinol in 10 μM concentrations of allopurinol.
Black bars with blank feature denote KHB, the bars with diagonal stripes
represent William E (WE) medium and the bars with horizontal stripes
demonstrated RPMI medium. Data are average ± SEM of 3 independent
experiments. Asterisks denote statistically significant differences
(Student t-test, *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01).

Krebs–Henseleit
buffer (KHB) is a bicarbonate-based buffer,
which is commonly employed for phase I and II drug biotransformation
studies because they can maintain hepatocyte functions for short periods
of time (30–120 min) while ensuring minimal interference in
metabolite analysis and detection.33 However,
the immune responses triggered by skin-sensitizing drugs are mostly
dependent on the concentration and exposure duration to antigenic
reactive metabolites.34 Therefore, it is
essential for the cutaneous drug bioactivation models to generate
reactive metabolites continuously for a sufficiently long duration.
Being a minimal medium, KHB is not ideal for conducting longer-term
drug bioactivation studies. Thus, we compared the generation of reactive
drug metabolites by HepaRG-Heps in two complex media, namely, William
E (WE) and RPMI basal media, compared to KHB over a period of 6 h.

We first validated the LCMS analytical method by examining its
assay specificity, linearity, lower limits of quantitation (LLOQ),
stability, precision, and accuracy. The assay specificity was evaluated
by comparing the chromatograms of blank medium and quality control
(QC) samples to the drug-treated samples in different media (i.e.,
WE, RPMI and KHB). Our results indicated that the composition of the
different blank media did not interfere with the analysis of spiked
metabolites and internal standards (IS) (Figures S1–S3). In addition, the linearity of the detection
range was evaluated on three separate days with two sets of calibration
curves per day. The calibration curves showed good linearity over
a concentration range of 1–500 ng/mL for 3-OH CBZ, 2-OH CBZ,
and CBZ-E; 1–250 ng/mL for p-HPPH; and 100–5000 ng/mL
for oxipurinol, respectively, in all three media. Furthermore, Table S1 summarized all of the equations obtained
from calibration curves using weighted (1/x2) least squared linear regression. The precision and accuracy as
well as the recovery effect in different media for the inter-day and
intra-day are shown in Table 1. The precision (relative standard deviation, RSD) and accuracy
(relative error, RE) of the LCMS assay were within 20% at low concentrations
and 1% at high concentrations of quality controls (QCs) in all metabolites.
We also determined the matrix effect by normalizing LCMS readings
of different metabolites spiked into different media to metabolites
spiked into methanol (Table 1). The ratios were within the range of 90–110%, which
indicated the absence of media influence and all of the metabolites
were stable in both simple and complex media. Meanwhile, we also examined
the stability of metabolites in different media subjected to three
different storage conditions: (i) after three freeze–thaw cycles,
(ii) at room temperature for 24 h after preparation, and (iii) at
−20 °C for at least 14 days and all of the results are
summarized in Table S2. Similar to the
RSD and RE, all of the results shown were all within 20% at low concentrations
and 15% at medium and high concentrations of QCs, proving that the
five reactive drug metabolites were stable in the different media
under the three conditions tested.

Next, we
proceeded to assess whether the different media influenced
the production of reactive metabolites by the HepaRG-Heps. It was
observed that HepaRG-Heps could generate the highest levels of all
three CBZ metabolites in KHB buffer (Figure 2B–D), while there was no significant
difference in the bioactivation of PHT into p-HPPH in the three media
(Figure 2E). For oxipurinol,
the metabolite production was the highest in WE medium and the lowest
in the simple medium, KHB (Figure 2F). It is likely that different bioactivation pathways
and enzymes were involved in the conversion of parent drugs into their
metabolites, and different media could maintain the different metabolic
enzymes to varying extents. Nonetheless, it was ascertained that different
media compositions affected the bioactivation of different reactive
drug metabolites by HepaRG-Heps, but not their detection by LCMS.

2.3 Assessment of Skin-Sensitizing Potential of
Reactive Drug Metabolites Generated by HepaRG-Hep
Finally,
we attempted to establish a functional assay to evaluate the immunogenic
potential of the reactive drug metabolites generated by HepaRG-Hep.
U937 is a myeloid cell line, which is known to undergo functional
and phenotypic alteration from monocytes to antigen-presenting cells
(APC), indicated by the upregulation of IL8, IL1β, and CD86 after treatment with
dermal skin sensitizers.27−29 Therefore, we postulated that
by exposing U937 cells to HepaRG-Heps conditioned medium that contained
the reactive drug metabolites, the U937 cells can be activated into
an APC phenotype if the drug metabolites are potentially antigenic
skin sensitizers (Figure 3A).

of U937 cells into APCs by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) or CBZ’s
reactive metabolites. (A) Schematics illustrating DNCB treatment in
different composite media with varying ratios of KHB or WE to RPMI
(1:5, 1:10, and 1:20). (B) Gene expression changes in inflammatory
cytokines (IL8 and IL1β) and
the antigen-presenting costimulatory receptor, CD86, in U937 cells maintained in RMPI medium after 12 h (blue-gray

1 μM DNCB. (C–E) Gene expression changes after 48 h of
treatment with 1 μM DNCB in different composite media relative

WE/RPMI. The dotted lines represent the gene expression of U937 after
48 h of 1 μM DNCB treatment in RPMI medium. (F–H) Growth
rate and functional response of U937 to CBZ’s reactive metabolites
in different ratios of KHB/RPMI conditioned medium after 48 h of incubation.
(F) Percentages of U937’s growth rate after 48 h of treatment
in different ratios of KHB/RPMI. Gene expression changes in U937 for
(G) IL8 and (H) IL1β after
being treated with reconstituted CBZ’s metabolites and HepaRG-Heps
conditioned medium in different KHB/RPMI ratios at 48 h. Data are
average ± SEM of 3 independent experiments. Asterisks denote
statistically significant differences (Student t-test,
*p < 0.05) while ns represents no significant
differences.

U937 cells are routinely maintained
in RPMI medium, which was not
optimal for the generation of all drug metabolites (Figure 2B–F). Therefore, there
is a need to determine a composite medium suitable for both metabolite
productions by hepatocytes as well as U937 activation. Thus, the functional
activation of U937 cells by a potent skin-sensitizing compound, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene
(DNCB), into APCs was assessed in different media. U937 cells performed
the best in its own RPMI medium. When U937 cells were stimulated with
DNCB in RPMI medium, there was significant upregulation in the transcriptional
expressions of IL8, IL1β,
and CD86 compared to untreated U937 cells (Figure 3B), which was in
accordance with prior studies.27 However,
this functional response of U937 cells was highly sensitive to the
culture media composition. When the cells were stimulated with DNCB
in RPMI adulterated with varying ratios of KHB or WE media (1:5, 1:10
and 1:20), the extent of IL8, IL1β, and CD86 upregulation was significantly
attenuated compared to RPMI alone (Figure 3C–E). We observed that the KHB/RPMI
composite media performed slightly better than the WE/RPMI composite
media in producing an immunological response, especially at 1:20 ratio.
Importantly, we found that in the growth rate of U937 in 1:20 KHB/RPMI
medium was the highest (90.6 ± 2.8%) similar to that of U937
cells maintained in RPMI medium (Figure 3F).

We also assessed whether the immunological
response of U937 cells
elicited by CBZ reactive metabolites was affected by different KHB/RPMI
composite media. Both reconstituted reactive metabolites (i.e., CBZ-E,
2-OH CBZ, 3-OH CBZ, and combination of these metabolites) as well
as HepaRG-hepatocyte conditioned medium were tested. In this experiment,
the concentrations selected for reconstituted metabolites were based
on the total amount of concentrations generated by HepaRG-Hep in different
ratios of the conditioned medium as shown in Table S3. We observed that only HepaRG-Hep conditioned medium in
1:20 KHB/RPMI could produce a significant increase in IL8 (Figure 3G) and IL1β (Figure 3H) expressions compared to control cells treated with the
parent drug, CBZ. It is also interesting to note that all of the concentrations
of CBZ-E, 2-OH CBZ, and 3-OH CBZ in HepaRG-Hep conditioned medium
at 1:20 dilution were much lower than that of the reconstituted metabolites
(Table S9). Therefore, it is likely that
the conditioned medium contained other reactive metabolites generated
from CBZ itself or after the secondary metabolism of 2-OH CBZ and
3-OH CBZ. The results underscore the importance of having a highly
functional hepatic cell model, such as HepaRG-Heps to generate a full
repertoire of reactive metabolites as well as a suitable composite
medium (1:20 KHB/RPMI) to maintain the immunological functions of
U937 cells.

The optimized functional assay was employed to evaluate
the skin-sensitizing
potential of CBZ, PHT, and allopurinol. Briefly, test compounds were
incubated with HepaRG-Heps in KHB medium for 6 h. The conditioned
medium was then collected and reconstituted with RPMI at a ratio of
1:20 before being introduced to the U937 cells (Figure 4A). Acetaminophen (APAP) was included as
a negative control drug because it gets metabolized into N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, the reactive metabolites
that will cause a toxic effect to the liver but not skin.35 We observed that conditioned media incubated
with all of the paradigm skin sensitizers stimulated upregulation
of IL8, IL1β, and CD86 compared to parent drug alone (Figure 4B–D). In contrast, conditioned medium
incubated with APAP did not trigger any upregulation of the APC markers
(Figure 4B–D).
These results indicated that the APC activation assay can differentiate
the reactive metabolites of skin-sensitizing drugs from those of hepatotoxic
drugs.

to the RPMI ratio. Data are average ± SEM of 3 independent experiments.

3 Discussion
Severe cutaneous reactions associated with the therapeutic drugs
used have been proposed to be caused by antigenic reactive drug metabolites,
which can trigger a pathological adaptive immune response.36,37 Various metabolic pathway studies have been performed using animal
models to provide clues for the identification of possible reactive
metabolites that might contribute to skin sensitization. For example,
33 metabolites from CBZ have been identified from rat and human urine38 while PHT is found to be metabolized primarily
into p-HPPH.13 Wei Lu and colleagues further
postulated that 2-OH CBZ, 3-OH CBZ, and p-HPPH were the reactive metabolites
from CBZ and PHT, respectively, due to their ability to generate reactive
oxygen species (ROS). These ROS can bind randomly to form protein
adducts to initiate immunological response after incubating with liver
microsomes and myeloperoxidase.39 Despite
recognizing the importance of liver-mediated drug biotransformation
and immune activation in the etiology of severe cutaneous reactions,
there has been limited effort to develop in vitro models that can
predict the skin-sensitizing potential of a drug. In this study, we
demonstrate a proof-of-concept in vitro testing scheme, involving
the sequential application of paradigm skin sensitizers to a bioactivating-hepatic
cell model followed by an immunologically reactive APC model to determine
their skin sensitization potential. The hepatic model would convert
the parent compound into its reactive metabolites, which would be
subsequently cross-fed to an APC model to evaluate their immunogenicity
potential.

We first showed that HepaRG-Heps were metabolically
competent in
producing various reactive drug metabolites of three paradigm skin
sensitizers. The generation of reactive drug metabolites in the context
of cutaneous reactions has only been evaluated in liver microsomes.18,40,41 Compared to microsomes, which
only contain a limited subset of liver metabolic enzymes,42 human hepatocytes will be able to more accurately
recapitulate the biotransformation of drugs into their corresponding
reactive metabolite species. For instance, the generation of the antigenic
reactive metabolite, oxipurinol, from allopurinol is mediated by xanthine
oxidase (XO),14,24 which is typically absent from
liver microsome preparations.42 In contrast,
HepaRG-Heps have been discovered not only to have high CYP450 enzymes
but also contain XO.24 Indeed, we proved
that incubation of HepaRG-Heps with allopurinol can generate oxipurinol
in different media (Figure 2). Therefore, our cutaneous bioactivation model using HepaRG-Hep
serves to more comprehensively mimic the metabolism of a large range
of drugs.

The cross-feeding of conditioned medium from drug-treated
hepatocytes
to immune cells have mostly been performed in the context of idiosyncratic
drug-induced liver injury. For example, Kato et al. tested the supernatant
generated by the FLC-4 hepatocyte cell line with THP-1 derived macrophages;43 Kegel et al. tested the supernatant from human
primary hepatocytes treated with hepatotoxic drugs on isolated human
Kupffer cells;44 and Oda et al. used the
supernatant from drug-treated HepG2 and HepaRG to treat with human
promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell.45 In
these studies, the immune cell model exhibited macrophage-like phenotype
and functions because they were used as proxies for Kupffer cells.
In the case of adverse cutaneous reactions, the pathological immunological
reaction is initiated by antigenic reactive metabolites activating
APCs, which will in turn activate cytotoxic effector cells.46 Therefore, we have selected the use of U937
cells as the immune cell model because they are used in well-established
standardized OECD tests to detect dermal skin sensitizers. Indeed,
the activation of APC by U937 cells was not only affected by dermal
skin sensitizers, such as DNCB (Figure 3B–E), but also by antigenic reactive metabolites
from skin-sensitizing drugs, including CBZ, PHT, and allopurinol (Figures 3G–H and 4B–D). Importantly, the reactive metabolite
of acetaminophen, which is known to cause hepatotoxicity but not skin
sensitization, did not trigger a positive response in the U937 cells
(Figure 4B–D).
Therefore, our immune functional assay is specific to cutaneous reactions.

In this study, the presentation of reactive metabolites was realized
via the cross-feeding of conditioned medium from drug-treated HepaRG-Heps
to U937 cells. Since HepaRG-Heps and U937 cells were maintained in
different culture media, there was a need to evaluate the functions
of the 2 cell types in different media. Our results indicated that
both simple (KHB) and complex (WE and RPMI) media did not interfere
with their detection by LCMS (Table 1). However, the generation of different drug metabolites
by HepaRG-Heps differed significantly between different media (Figure 2). For example, the
metabolism of CBZ is mainly mediated by CYP450 enzymes, which are
well-maintained in KHB buffer.33 Thus,
the production of CBZ metabolites was the highest in KHB (Figure 2B–D). In contrast,
the highest production of oxipurinol was observed in WE medium (Figure 2F). This is likely
due to the presence of dexamethasone in WE medium, which induces XO,47 the main enzyme that bioactivates allopurinol
to oxipurinol. Similarly, we found that the activation of U937 cells
was highly sensitive to the medium composition. The stimulation of
U937 cells into APC-like cells was most robust in its own maintenance
medium (i.e., RPMI). Addition of WE medium consistently attenuated
the APC activation response to a greater extent than KHB buffer (Figure 3C–E). This
may be due to the presence of inhibitory factors present in a more
complex medium. The ratio of KHB/RPMI must also be carefully titrated
as a higher proportion of hepatocyte medium (1:5 and 1:10), adversely
affecting both the growth rate as well as the APC activation response
(Figure 3). This resulted
in the dilution of reactive metabolites present in the conditioned
medium collected from drug-treated HepaRG-Heps, which may explain
why the APC activation response was relatively weak (Figure 4). A compartmentalized coculture
of liver and immune that can maintain different types of cells in
their own medium and allow the diffusion of metabolites would circumvent
this limitation to activate a robust immune response.

4 Conclusions
We have shown that HepaRG-Heps could generate
skin-sensitizing
metabolites resulting from both CYP450 and XO metabolism. Thus, HepaRG-Heps
can potentially serve as the hepatic bioactivation model in the development
of in vitro adverse cutaneous drug reaction testing. A functional
assay based on the activation of APC by U937 cells was also established
to prospectively evaluate the immunogenic potential of drug-reactive
metabolites. This assay could distinguish between the reactive metabolites
of 3 known skin sensitizers (i.e., CBZ, PHT, and allopurinol), from
a nonskin sensitizer (APAP). However, the cross-feeding of conditioned
medium from drug-treated hepatocytes to immune cells was nonideal
due to the sensitivity of the U937 cells to medium compositions. Nonetheless,
this study demonstrates that the extent of APC activation by reactive
drug metabolites generated by HepaRG-Heps can potentially be used
to predict potential skin-sensitizing drugs.

5 Materials
and Methods
5.1 Materials
All drugs, chemicals, and
reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Singapore unless otherwise
stated.

5.2 HepaRG-Derived Hepatocyte (HepaRG-Hep) Cultures
HepaRG progenitor cells (Biopredic International, France) were
cultured and differentiated according to the manufacturer’s
protocols.48 Briefly, the HepaRG progenitor
cells were proliferated and matured in growth medium for 14 days.
The cells were then adapted in a medium with a 1:1 ratio of HepaRG
growth and differentiation medium for the next 3 days before undergoing
the differentiation process for another 14 days. The HepaRG growth
medium and differentiation medium were prepared using William’s
E medium (WE) supplemented with HepaRG growth additives (Biopredic,
France) and differentiation additives (Biopredic, France), respectively.
After a total period of 14 days of growth and 17 days of differentiation,
HepaRG-derived hepatocytes (HepaRG-Hep) were used for gene expression
analysis, CYP basal activities, and drug testing experiment.

5.3 Primary Human Hepatocyte (PHH) Culture
Cryopreserved
primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) were obtained from
Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA) and BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes,
NJ). Three different lots of cryopreserved PHHs were used for the
experiments. The cells were cultured in William’s E (WE) medium
supplemented with 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), insulin transferrin,
and selenium, 50 ng/mL linoleic acid, 50 nM dexamethasone, and 100
U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin. Culture medium was replenished daily.
Freshly thawed PHHs were used for gene expression analysis. PHHs cultured
for 24 h were used for the examination of albumin production, and
CYP basal activities.

5.4 U937 Cell Cultures
U937 cells were
obtained from ATCC. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life
Technologies, Singapore) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin–100 μg/mL
streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone). Cells were
passaged every 3 days. The cell number and viability were measured
using the Trypan blue dye and the growth rate of U937 was defined
as the percentage of viable cells in conditioned medium to the viable
cells in RPMI.

5.5 Immunostaining
HepaRG-Heps were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by permeabilization
with 0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 20 min and blocking in a solution of
2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h. The sample was then
stained with primary antibodies: rabbit anti-CYP3A4 (Abcam, Cambridge,
U.K.) and mouse anti-CK19 (Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.) overnight. Subsequently,
after rinsing three times with 1× PBS, the sample was stained
with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse and
555-conjugated anti-rabbit, Life Technologies) for 1 h in room temperature.
Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher). Imaging was
performed using a fluorescence (Nikon Ti-E, Japan) microscope.

5.6 Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA
was purified from samples using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Singapore).
tRNA was then transcribed into cDNA using a Tetro cDNA synthesis kit
(Bioline, U.K.). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with FastStart
Universal SYBR Green Master reagents (Rox) (Roche, Germany) in a ViiA
7 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Fold changes
of transcripts in U937 cells relative to untreated control samples
were determined by ΔΔCt while log2(GAPDH-gene) was used
for hepatocyte gene expression. The primers used for human hepatocytes
and U937 cells are listed in Tables S4 and S5, respectively.

5.7 Cytochrome P450 Activity
Basal activities
of two important cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (i.e., CYP1A2 and CYP3A4),
were determined. Following differentiation, HepaRG-Hep were incubated
in 100 μL of Krebs–Henseleit buffer (KHB) with a cocktail
of CYPs substrates (Table S6) in 96 well
plates for 2 h at 37 °C. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was selected
as a solvent to dissolve the CYP substrates as stock solutions. The
stock solutions of CYP substrates were diluted in KHB to a final concentration
such that DMSO did not exceed 0.1%. The metabolites generated by HepaRG-Hep
were then analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS).
In general, 100 μL of supernatants generated by HepaRG-Hep were
spiked with 100 μL of APAP D4 as internal standards (Table S6). The mixtures were dried using a vacuum
concentrator (Eppendorf, Germany) in room temperature for at least
6 h to eliminate the solvent. 100 μL of methanol containing
0.1% formic acid was added into each of the dried residues and followed
by a vortex mixing. After centrifuging at 10 000g for 10 min at 4 °C, 60 μL of the sample supernatant was
collected for LCMS analysis (LC: 1100 series, Agilent, Singapore;
MS:LCQ Deca XP Max, Finnigan, Singapore). The drug metabolite products
are acetaminophen (APAP) and hydroxy midazolam for CYP1A2 and CYP3A4,
respectively.

5.8 Albumin Secretion
The assessment
of albumin function in hepatocytes was performed using the human albumin
ELISA quantitation kit (Bethyl Laboratory Inc.) based on the manufacturer’s
recommendation. Culture media were collected from HepaRG-Heps on days
3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 for albumin analysis. The measurements of albumin
production rates were normalized to the number of cells in the culture,
which was determined by measuring the DNA content of the samples using
a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Singapore)
and was subsequently extrapolated from a standard curve established
with a known cell number.

5.9 High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography-Mass
Spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) analysis
The quantitative analysis
of the skin-sensitizing drugs and their metabolites was performed
using an Agilent 1290 Infinity Rapid Resolution Liquid Chromatography
System (Agilent, Lexington, MA), connected to an Agilent 6495 triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer. The Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (50
mm × 3.0 mm, i.d., 2.7 μm) was used to carry out the chromatographic
separation. The detail of the mobile phase is shown in Table S7. The details of multiple reaction modes
are shown in Table S8 for ion detection.
The conditions for mass spectrometry were also optimized with 3000
V of capillary voltage, 16 L/min of gas flow rate, 150 °C of
dry gas temperature, 350 °C of sheath gas temperature, and 40
psi of nebulizer.

5.10 Calibration Standard and
Quality Control
Samples
A primary stock solution of metabolites and internal
standard (IS) were prepared by dissolving the weighed metabolites
and IS in methanol, respectively. A series of working standards were
prepared by serially diluting the stock solution of metabolites with
methanol. All of the solutions were stored below 4 °C. The calibration
standards were prepared by adding 10 μL of working standard
solution of metabolites to 90 μL of blank media. Three levels
of quality control (QC) samples in different media (WE, RPMI, and
KHB) were prepared separately using the same method.

5.11 Sample Preparation and Extraction
HepaRG-Heps were
incubated with various concentrations of carbamazepine
(100 μM), phenytoin (15 μM), and allopurinol (10 μM)
in either William E (WE), RPMI, or KHB for 2 or 6 h. The final concentrations
of each drug were selected according to their solubility and previously
reported IC50 values.49 A volume
of 100 μL medium sample in different media (WE, RPMI, and KHB),
QC, and calibration standard were spiked with 10 μL of IS and
vortexed for 10 seconds, respectively. The mixture extraction was
first carried out using 1 mL of ethyl acetate with 2 min of vortex
mixing and followed by centrifugation to separate the aqueous and
organic layers at 5000 rpm for 3 min. The organic layer was collected
and dried using a vacuum concentrator. 100 μL of methanol was
added into the dried residues and vortexed for 30 seconds before centrifuging
at 12 000 rpm for 5 min. A sample with a volume of 2 μL
was collected for HPLC-QqQ-MS analysis.

5.12 LCMS
Method Validation
5.12.1 Specificity
Analysis specificity
was calculated by comparing the ion chromatograms from (1) blank WE,
RPMI, and KHB media, (2) the blank media spiked with reconstituted
metabolites as QC, and (3) the supernatants collected from HepaRG-Heps
after being treated with skin sensitization drugs (CBZ, PHT, and allopurinol)
in different media.

5.12.2 Linearity and Lower
Limits of Quantitation
(LLOQ)
A volume of 10 μL of mixed working solutions
and 10 μL of IS solution were added into 90 μL of blank
media to prepare the calibration samples. The samples were then pretreated
as described in Section 5.11. The resulting media contained 1–500 ng/mL of 2-OH
CBZ, 3-OH CBZ, and CBZ-E; 1–250 ng/mL of p-HPPH and 100–5000
ng/mL of oxipurinol. The calibration curve was first constructed by
calculating the peak area ratio of metabolites/IS plotted against
the corresponding concentrations. A 1/x2 weighted linear least-squares regression model was then calculated
using Mass Hunter Quantitative Analysis Software (version B.07.00,
Agilent) to establish the calibration curve. All of the concentrations
of unknown samples were calculated by interpolation from the established
calibration curve, and the LLOQ represented the lowest concentration.

5.12.3 Precision and Accuracy
The evaluation
of precision and accuracy was performed using QC samples at different
concentrations (i.e., low, medium, and high), where precision of analysis
was indicated by the relative standard deviation (RSD in %); while
the accuracy of analysis was indicated by relative error (RE in %).
The assessment of intra-day, inter-day precision and accuracy were
performed for three consecutive days with five replicates. The precision
and accuracy of sample analyses were calculated using calibration
curves obtained daily.

5.12.4 Extraction Recovery
and Matrix Effects
The extraction recovery efficiency was
calculated by determining
the ratio of the amounts of QC samples after sample preparation to
the original spiked solution. The effect of different media composition
on the separation and detection of drug species (henceforth referred
to as the matrix effect) was evaluated by normalizing the LCMS readings
of samples where drug metabolites were spiked into blank media (WE,
RPMI, and KHB) to the readings where metabolites were spiked into
methanol at three different QC concentrations. A ratio of 100% indicated
that the components of the culture media did not affect LCMS detection
of the drug species. All analyses were conducted using five replicates.

5.12.5 Stability
The long-term stability
and post-preparation stability of metabolites in different matrices
were evaluated using the quality control (QS) samples there were stored
at either −20 °C for 14 days or at room temperature for
24 h with three freeze–thaw cycles.

5.13 Systemic Drug-Induced Skin Sensitization
Assay
2 × 105 U937 cells were seeded in each
well of a 12-well plate containing 2 mL of RPMI or HepaRG-Hep conditioned
medium. For HepaRG-Hep conditioned medium, HepaRG-Heps were first
grown for 14 days and differentiated for another 14 days in 96 well
plates before incubating with parent drugs (i.e., CBZ, PHT, allopurinol,
and APAP) for 6 h containing 100 μL of KHB. The number of HepaRG-Heps
was around 3 × 104 cells for each well in the 96 well
plate culture, which was determined by measuring the DNA content of
the lysed HepaRG-Heps’ samples using the Quant-iT PicoGreen
dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Singapore). The KHB containing
drug metabolites generated by HepaRG-Heps was then collected and reconstituted
with fresh RPMI medium in the ratio of 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5 as the
conditioned medium before adding to the U937 cells. The concentration
of supplements used in the conditioned medium (e.g., FBS and Pen/strep)
were adjusted to a final concentration of 10% FBS and 1% Pen/strep.
Details on the composition of the conditioned medium are shown in Table S9. Negative and positive controls were
included in every experiment. The negative control corresponded to
U937 cells in RPMI or conditioned medium (in ratio 1:20, 1:10 and
1:5) without any drug treatment; while the positive control was U937
cells treated with 1 μM of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) for
48 h since it is a strong contact skin sensitizer.27 After incubating U937 cells with parent drugs, reconstituted
metabolites and supernatant collected from drug-treated HepaRG-Heps
in either RPMI or different ratios of conditioned medium at 37 °C
with 5% CO2 for 48 h, U937 cells were harvested for real-time qRT-PCR
analyses to examine the changes of gene expression of IL8, IL1β, and CD86.
