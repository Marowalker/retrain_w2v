The natural J-coupling
(NJC) method is applied
to analyze the Fermi contact contribution of the NMR spin–spin
coupling constant decomposing this contribution in terms of natural
localized molecular orbitals. We investigated the influence of the
basis set on the NJC analysis for the formyl group coupling constant
(1JCHf) of benzaldehyde derivatives.
NJC and other NBO analyses, like steric and natural Coulombic energy,
were chosen to explain the influence of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
groups on 1JCHf for some substituted
benzaldehydes (Me, OH, OMe, F, Cl, Br, I, and NO2). For
the ortho derivatives, electronegative substituents
near the C–Hf bond increase the 1JCHf coupling. This effect could be related to an increase
in formyl carbon s character and changes in the carbon
and hydrogen natural charges. This indicates that the substituents
in ortho have a proximity effect on 1JCHf coupling mainly of electrostatic origin
instead of the expected hyperconjugative interactions.

Introduction
Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is the most powerful spectroscopic
technique for obtaining detailed chemical information in solution
being widely applied for structure elucidation. The fundamental parameters
such as chemical shift (δ) and scalar coupling constant (J) are the most important sources of information to achieve
unequivocal molecular structure assignment and can also be applied
to determine the conformation adopted by a molecule in solution.1,2 As δ and J are sensitive to the electronic
environment experienced by the nuclei, both can be used as a probe
to evaluate small changes in the electronic structure.3 Quantum mechanical calculations are usually required to
support the NMR experimental measurements providing interesting information
about how the stereoelectronic interactions contribute to nuclear
magnetic shielding and spin–spin coupling constant (SSCC) transmission
mechanisms.3−8

Among the different types of SSCCs (one-bond, two-bond, three-bond,
and long-range SSCC), the one-bond SSCC stands out for providing important
information about the nature of the chemical bond.9 The one-bond SSCC is an indirect interaction between two
atoms bonded; therefore, the bond length and the s character of the involved atoms are often invoked to explain
conformational and substituent effects on this type of coupling constant.9−12 For example, it is expected, for molecular systems with the same
connectivity, that 1JCH decreases
with bond lengthening but increases when s character
for the spn carbon hybrid orbital rises.9,13 These relationships allow us correlate the 1JCH values with hybridization and stereoelectronic effects
such as hyperconjugative and conjugative interactions.3,9,12,14

The Perlin effect13 is probably
the
most known effect that correlates the 1JCH with bond length. The smaller 1JCH shown for axial hydrogens (Haxial) in cyclohexane
and some derivatives are usually assigned as a result of hyperconjugative
interactions between occupied (lone pair, π or σ orbitals)
and unoccupied σC–Haxial* orbitals in an antiperiplanar
relationship.13−16 These interactions tend to lengthen and weaken the C–Haxial bond decreasing the 1JCH. However, the hyperconjugative origin of the Perlin effect
has been discussed mainly in the work of Cuevas et al.,17 which attributed that the increase in the 1JCH value in HCOC fragments arises
from dipolar interactions. Moreover, electrostatic effects have also
been suggested to explain 1JCH variations for hydrogen-bonded complexes, where it was observed
that negative charges near the H atom could increase 1JCH.18−20 These observations indicate that 1JCH is not in a direct simple
way related to bond lengths; therefore, other factors such as electrostatic
and rehybridization effects should be considered.9

Information about the origin of SSCC transmission
mechanisms could
be obtained through decomposition analyses. A variety of methods have
been proposed to decompose the SSCCs into orbital contributions to
clarify which are the main interactions that influence the SSCCs transmission.21−28 Among them, the natural J-coupling (NJC) is often
applied to understand the role of steric and hyperconjugation effects
on the transmission mechanisms of the SSCCs.3,29−32

The NJC, an NBO-based method, is employed to analyze the Fermi
contact (FC) portion of the SSCC. The NJC splits the FC contribution
in terms of individual natural localized molecular orbitals (NLMOs),
which can provide insights into the electronic structure of molecules
once each NLMO contribution is decomposed into Lewis (L) and non-Lewis
(NL) terms. These terms allow assessing the “steric”
or “hyperconjugative” origin of the SSCC once the former
is usually associated with the L term of each NLMO and the latter
is related to orbital delocalization. A complete description and some
applications of the NJC method can be found in the original article
published by Wilkens et al.30 This approach
was successfully applied to illustrate the angular and distance dependences
of the vicinal 3JHH coupling
constants in ethane and long-range 6JHH in pentane. It was demonstrated that these coupling constants
are dominated by the Lewis term.30 A study
with similar interest was proposed to investigate the torsional dependence
and substituent effect for ethane and fluoroethane.32 Also, NJC has been used to understand complex effects,
such as the Perlin effect, which was deeply explored on oxocane derivatives16 by our research group. These examples demonstrate
NJC as an important approach to understand the transmission mechanisms
of the SSCC in several organic compounds.

An important precaution
when working with NBO analyses is the proper
basis set choice. A detailed investigation about the use of very large
basis sets with augmented diffuse functions in NBO analyses has already
been published and it presents anomalies on energies results.33 Therefore, it is not surprising if any NBO-based
results could be liable to the influence of the basis set choice.

In a previous work about basis set dependence on NJC analysis,30 the authors did not observe any important influence
of the basis set choice, so they suggested that the choice of the
atomic basis set has no appreciable effect on the decomposition results.
On the other hand, another study reported anomalous values on FC decomposition
of 3JHH coupling when BS2 basis set, developed specially for J-coupling
calculations, was used on NJC analysis.32 For larger coupling constants, like the results published for 1JCF using the EPR-III basis set,3 it was observed that Rydberg (Ry) contributions
were important to describe the transmission of 1JCF coupling. However, Rydberg orbitals are included
in the NBO scheme to ensure orbital orthogonality and, according to
NBO theory, it is not expected a significant role of this kind of
orbitals in the analysis.30,33,34 So, a physical interpretation of Rydberg contribution prevents reliable
conclusions about the transmission mechanism of the SSCCs and that
result could be only an outcome of an unsuitable basis set choice
for this kind of analysis.

Based on the difficulty to rationalize
the effect of stereoelectronic
interactions on 1JCH and how
the basis set chosen can affect the NJC analysis, the present study
aims to evaluate the effect of substituents on the 1JCH of substituted benzaldehydes using the density
functional theory (DFT). In this paper, ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted benzaldehydes
were chosen as a model system to verify how electron-donating and
electron-withdrawing substituents could affect 1JCHf (Figure 1). These molecules allow us to evaluate the role of
σ- and π-systems and also how the substituent position
influences 1JCHf, mainly the
proximity effect in ortho-substituted compounds.
Furthermore, the influence of the basis set choice on NJC analysis
for 1JCHf is investigated by
testing different combinations of polarization and diffuse functions.
We also apply the natural steric and natural Coulombic energy (NCE)
analysis35 to investigate changes on the
L term of the SSCCs according to steric or electrostatic components.

Results and Discussion
Overall Trends for 1JCHf
Figure 2 shows the experimental results
of 1JCHf for all benzaldehyde
derivatives studied. These data
are displayed as a difference (Δ1JCHf) relative to benzaldehyde to allow an easier comparison,
and the corresponding values are presented in Table S2 in the Supporting Information (SI).

Figure 2 Experimental 1JCHf coupling
constants difference (Δ1JCHf) relative to benzaldehyde (174.0 Hz) for all compounds under investigation.

A significant increase of about
10 Hz (18 Hz for nitro-substituted)
on the SSCC is observed when the substituents are in ortho position, except for hydroxyl and methyl groups, where a small increase
(2.4 Hz) and a slight decrease (1.0 Hz) are detected, respectively.
This effect was intensified with the presence of a fluoride group
in position 2 for the compounds substituted in positions 2 and 6.
On the other hand, meta- and para-substituted benzaldehydes show similar
values (except for nitro) of 1JCHf as observed for the benzaldehyde. These experimental evidences suggest
that the spatial proximity between C–Hf bond and substituents
in ortho position is more important for the 1JCHf transmission pathway than
the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing character of the substituents.

Theoretical SSCC calculated with DFT indicated that 1JCHf is totally described by the FC term
(Table S3), what is expected for a one-bond
SSCC. This was corroborated by applying the SOPPA(CCSD)/aug-cc-pVTZ-J
theoretical level for benzaldehyde 1JCHf SSCC calculation (1JCHftotal = 170.4 Hz; 1JCHfSD = 0.2 Hz; 1JCHfPSO = −1.3; 1JCHfDSO = 1.0 Hz; 1JCHfFC = 170.5 Hz).

To understand the origin
of the FC term increase on 1JCHf, the NJC methodology was applied.
For this purpose, first, a basis set dependence investigation was
carried out.

Basis Set Dependence on NJC Analysis
Although three
functionals, namely, PBE, PBE0, and BHandH, have been used, only results
applying the PBE0 functional are presented in the main text for the
benzaldehyde and o-chorobenzaldehyde, which were
chosen to highlight our findings related to basis set dependence on
the NJC decomposition analysis. The results obtained with PBE and
BHandH functionals follow a similar trend despite the difference in
absolute values (Tables S4–S12).

To check the influence of the basis set on NJC analysis, 11 different
combinations of polarization and diffuse functions were tested to
decompose the FC term into L and NL contributions for benzaldehyde.
Once the absolute values of the FC term and its contributions could
change significantly according to different combinations of functional
and basis set, a correction factor was applied to the results of each
basis set to adjust the FC term according to the experimental 1JCHf. Using the corrected FC term,
it is possible to evaluate how the ratio of L to NL (repolarization,
valence antibonding, and Rydberg) contributions changes according
to the atomic basis set used.

The correction factors were calculated
by dividing the experimental 1JCHf of the benzaldehyde by the
total FC obtained using each basis set. This correction was possible
since the theoretical SSCC is dominated by the FC term. While the
original data are presented in the SI, Figure 3 shows the data multiplied
by the correction factor for each basis set.

Figure 3 Fermi contact (FC) contributions
(Hz) to the 1JCHf of benzaldehyde.
The total FC and its contributions
are relative to the experimental 1JCHf applying the following correction factors: D95 (1.0202),
6-31+G* (1.0872), cc-pVDZ (1.0437), 6-311G** (1.1217), 6-311++G**
(1.1312), aug-cc-pVDZ (1.0543), cc-pVTZ (1.1413), aug-cc-pVTZ (1.1320),
aug-cc-pVTZ-J (0.9268), EPR-III (1.0342), and pcJ-2 (0.9452).

According to Figure 3, it is possible to observe
that L contributions (in purple) are
always positive, while the NL ones are negative, reminding that NL
is the sum of the repolarization (red), valence antibonding (blue),
and Rydberg orbital (green) contributions. Only the D95 and 6-31+G*
do not show significant Rydberg (Ry) contributions. An anomalous profile
of these contributions was observed when the atomic basis set 6-311++G**
is used, i.e., a large negative Ry and a much higher positive L contribution
was observed.

Interestingly, L and NL contributions change significantly
according
to the atomic basis set used, but in all cases, the same trend is
observed, i.e., positive and negative values for the L and NL contributions,
respectively. The main deviations are observed on the ratio for the
valence antibonding and Ry orbitals contributions. Therefore, for
studies of SSCCs transmission mechanism applying the NJC methodology,
it is important to choose a proper basis set, consistent with the
NBO methodology, to get results with contributions mainly distributed
into the valence orbitals that is the main idea of NBO analysis.

The NJC analysis is usually performed to comparative purposes.30 Thus, to be considered chemically useful, the
NJC analysis must be sensitive and consistent to changes between two
or more molecules, not just evaluating the absolute contributions
values for one structure. Therefore, the total FC contribution for
the benzaldehyde was compared to o-chlorobenzaldehyde
(Figure 4a). In this
case, no correction factor was applied since we are also evaluating
the accuracy of the basis set describing the FC difference between o-chlorobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde.

Figure 4 (a) Main differences
of the FC term and its orbital contributions
(Hz) between o-chorobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde.
(b) Main differences of the σC–Hf NLMO contributions
to the FC term between o-chorobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde.

Even though the absolute values
differ considerably according to
the theoretical level applied, the difference of FC term for 1JCHf coupling between o-chlorobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde (Tables S10–S12) is very similar for all functionals
tested with the same basis set. Except for 6-31+G*, the FC difference
(ΔFC term) for all basis set described satisfactorily the experimental 1JCHf difference between o-chlorobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde.

For all basis
sets tested, it was also observed that the increase
in the total FC contribution is described by σC–Hf NLMO (Figure 4b and Table S13), which is mainly formed by the coupled
nuclei.

In general, a better agreement between experimental
and theoretical
difference in 1JCHf (∼8.8
Hz) was obtained when the D95, cc-pVDZ, and 6-311G** basis sets were
applied (Figure 4a).
For these basis sets, the Ry contribution to total FC term is less
than ±1.0 Hz. These three basis sets are not augmented with diffuse
functions, indicating that NJC analysis is strongly affected by the
addition of these types of functions, which agrees with Goodman and
Sauers’ work.33 According to these
authors, NBO methods based on orbital partitioning, as is the case
of NJC, are more susceptible to basis set issues, i.e., diffuse functions
can lead to artifacts of linear dependence and numerical instability.

The 6-31+G* was the worst Pople basis set describing the total
FC difference between the o-chlorobenzaldehyde and
benzaldehyde, probably due to lack of polarization function to consider
p orbitals at hydrogen atoms causing inaccuracies in the SSCC calculation.
For the remaining basis sets, it is clear that Ry contributions are
more pronounced when larger basis set augmented with diffuse functions
are used, preventing a correct description of the contribution responsible
for the transmission of 1JCHf SSCC for these two similar compounds. Among the basis sets used
for SSCC calculations, the EPR-III, a basis set developed for FC description
on EPR calculations, resulted in the worst FC decomposition because
the total FC term was mainly described by Ry contributions. The Sauer’s
(aug-cc-pVTZ-J) and Jensen’s (pcJ-2) basis sets, specially
developed for SSCC calculations, and the last one optimized for DFT
functional methods showed significant Ry contributions; however, the
FC term is mainly explained by the L term.

Considering that
the simplest double-ζ Dunning (D95) basis
set showed a better description of L and NL contributions and a good
correlation with experimental 1JCHf SSCC, this basis set would be suitable for performing NJC analysis
to pick up the steric and hyperconjugative effects, without incurring
the potential artifacts associated with diffuse functions.

We
also evaluated the performance of a long-range correlated functional
(CAM-B3LYP) and a functional with OPTX exchange function (OPBE) with
the basis set D95 and 6-311++G** (Tables S14–S16). Tables S14 and S15 show that long-range
correlation could be important since CAM-B3LYP slightly improves the 1JCHf obtained with B3LYP. The
OPBE performance was worse than PBE, indicating that OPTX exchange
function is not suitable for coupling constant calculation in comparison
to PBE exchange function. As the other functionals employed in this
work, despite the differences obtained between DFTs, the effect of
the functional is not as intense as the effect of the basis set for
the CAM-B3LYP and OPBE as well. Table S16 shows that B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, PBE, and OPBE provide the same conclusions
about the increase of Ry contributions on the 1JCHf difference between o-chlorobenzaldehyde
and benzaldehyde using basis augmented with diffuse functions (6-31++G**).
After the rationalization about a basis set appropriated to perform
NJC analysis, the PBE0/D95 level of theory was applied to evaluate
the substituent effect in ortho, meta, and para positions on 1JCHf for the benzaldehyde derivatives (Figure 1). For a better presentation
of the results, mono- and disubstituted benzaldehydes are discussed
separately.

Monosubstituted Benzaldehydes
The
FC values, calculated
by the NJC approach, are in good agreement with the experimental data,
indicating an increase of 1JCHf for most ortho-substituted benzaldehydes (Table S17) and no significant change for meta- and para-substituted benzaldehydes,
except for nitro substituent, which is discussed later on.

For
halogens and methoxy groups in ortho position, anti-conformers are more populated (>87%) than syn-conformers; therefore, the observed SSCCs are described
mainly by anti-conformers (Figure 1). For o-hydroxy, o-halo, and o-methoxybenzaldehyde, the anti-conformers show 1JCHf bigger
than benzaldehyde (Table S17). However,
for the o-hydroxy substituent, the theoretical and
experimental SSCCs do not have a significant increase in comparison
to benzaldehyde. For this compound, the conformer syn is the most stable (Figure 1), due to the high stability of the intramolecular hydrogen
bond of the hydroxyl group with the formyl oxygen. In the case of
the ortho methyl substituent, neither syn- nor anti-conformer showed 1JCHf higher than benzaldehyde (Table S17).

These observations suggest that the proximity
of electronegative
substituents to C–Hf bond increases 1JCHf and indicate that the change in the electron density
of the aromatic ring, caused by electron-withdrawing (e.g., NO2) or electron-donating (e.g., OMe) groups in meta and para positions, does not affect the SSCC studied.
Independently of the electronic character of the substituents in ortho
position, an increase in 1JCHf was observed for substituents containing lone pair orbitals available.
Therefore, lone pairs may affect 1JCHf by means of space interaction with C–Hf bond instead
of the π-system delocalization.

Through-space interactions
promoted by ortho substituents
are already known in the literature. For example, Zeidan et al.36 and Alabugin et al.37 while studying Bergman reactions observed that the cycloaromatization
kinetics is affected by electronic, steric, and electrostatic effects
caused by ortho substituents.

The NJC analysis
shows that the increase in 1JCHf for ortho-substituted benzaldehydes
occurs mainly on the L term of the σC–Hf NLMO
contribution, while the NL term shows very close values in comparison
to benzaldehyde (Table S18). These results
strongly corroborate that hyperconjugative contribution (NL term)
is not involved in the transmission of 1JCHf for studied systems.

It is not simple to describe
the L contribution to the SSCCs, but
usually for vicinal SSCCs, this term is associated with steric repulsion.30 However, in addition to a steric component,
electrostatic effects could also contribute to the Lewis energy.35 Some observations about the molecular electronic
structure are in accordance with the Lewis term increase, such as
the increase of s character on the carbon atom of
C–Hf bond (about 1%) (Table S19).
The increase of s character on the carbon of C–Hf
bond leads to a direct increase in the FC component, which is described
by s electrons near coupled nuclei, and consequently
in total 1JCHf SSCC (Figure 5a).

Figure 5 Differences between monosubstituted
benzaldehydes and benzaldehyde.
(a) σC–Hf NLMO Lewis (L) contributions for 1JCHf and formyl carbon (Cf) s character of σC–Hf NBO; (b) σC–Hf NLMO L contributions for 1JCHf and L VNCE between the formyl carbon and hydrogen atoms (VNCEC–Hf L); and (c) formyl carbon (Cf) s character
of σC–Hf NBO and VNCEC–Hf L.

Many factors could be associated
with the increase of carbon s character. For example,
an increase of Hf–C–C
bond angle and a slight shortening of the C–Hf bond length
(Table S19) were observed for all ortho-substituted benzaldehydes (except for o-methyl). This could be a response to the steric interaction between
the C–Hf orbital and the substituent’s lone pairs (Table S19). Rehybridization can also be observed
by the carbon s character of C=O and C–C bonds.

The interactions between the C–Hf orbital and the substituent’s
lone pairs or methyl C–H bonds could result in an electronic
rearrangement to accommodate the electronic density into internal
orbitals due to the proximity of substituent. However, despite the
C–H orbitals of the methyl substituent show a steric repulsion
with the C–Hf bond orbital, this compound does not show a similar
effect to the remaining ortho-substituted compounds.
This behavior suggests that this probably is not the main reason for
the increase in the 1JCHf observed
(Figure 2 and Table S19).

The 1JCHf increase could
also be explained by a C–Hf···X hydrogen bond.
In this case, once the NL contributions do not have appreciable influence
on FC increases, the weak LPX → σC–Hf* interactions
have no significant contributions for the FC term. On the other hand,
the electrostatic interaction resulting from C–Hf bond polarization
could be related to carbon s character increase.38

The carbon s character
may increase in improper
hydrogen-bonded complexes as a consequence of Bent’s rule,
which predicts that if the hydrogen atom becomes less electronegative,
in response to changes on atomic charges, the s character
carbon atom may increase. The C–Hf bond shortening (Table S19), generally known as blue-shifted hydrogen
bond, is a consequence of the formyl carbon rehybridization.39 In the present work, new approaches to visualize
how the charge or electronegative substituents affect the bond between
coupled nuclei were used.

Applying the qualitative natural Coulombic
energy (NCE) analysis,35 it was possible
to evaluate L and NL contributions
to the natural charges separately and apply it to estimate an L or
NL natural Coulombic energy (VNCEL/NL). Particularly, in this
study, this methodology was carried out to estimate the Lewis VNCEL of the formyl carbon and hydrogen pair (VNCEC–Hf L). This strategy was chosen because the main idea was to evaluate
the VNCEC–Hf L influence on the L term of 1JCHf. VNCEL was estimated using the following
equation 1  where qC and qH are the
Lewis charges for the formyl carbon
and hydrogen (in atomic unit), respectively, and |RC – RH| is the bond
length (in Bohr). VNCEL could be converted to kcal mol–1 by applying the conversation factor of 627.51.

In Figure 5, the
differences of σC–Hf NLMO contributions for
the 1JCHf of benzaldehyde derivatives
compared to benzaldehyde are related to the carbon s character (Figure 5a) and VNCEC–Hf L (Figure 5b), and a comparison between the s character and VNCEC–Hf L difference is shown
in Figure 5c. Analyzing
the difference in the VNCEC–Hf L of the formyl carbon
and hydrogen pair among the benzaldehyde derivatives in relation to
benzaldehyde, it was possible to visualize that in the cases where
the ortho substituents possess lone pairs near the
C–Hf bond, there is a great increase in VNCEC–Hf L (more than 200 kcal mol–1). In contrast, VNCEL is not affected in methyl substituent (Figure 5b and Table S19).

Once the L contribution of the FC term refers to the spin
density,
it is expected, especially for one-bond SSCC, that a large charge
difference between the coupled nuclei represents a large spin polarization
of the electronic system. Therefore, for the systems evaluated in
this work, the results are consistent with the suggestion that Coulomb
electrostatic interactions are the dominant effect caused by ortho substituents, which is responsible for the increase
of 1JCHf on benzaldehyde derivatives
instead of steric interactions.

As discussed above, it was verified
that Coulomb electrostatic
effects could be related to the increase in 1JCHf and once both VNCEC–Hf L and s character on the carbon of C–Hf bond increase when
the L term of the C–Hf bond contribution increases. The decrease
in the natural L charge of the formyl carbon (less positive) (Table S19) could be related to the increase in
the carbon s character (Figure 5c).

An exception was observed in o-hydroxybenzaldehyde,
where the syn-conformer is the only stable conformer
and no reasonable change in 1JCHf or the carbon s character is observed, but a higher
ΔVNCEC–Hf L was estimated. This principle
of estimation could be explained by the occurrence of the intramolecular
hydrogen bond between the formyl oxygen and the hydroxyl group (C=O···H–O).
The formyl carbon is directly bonded to the oxygen that participates
as acceptor on hydrogen bond. The L natural charge of the carbon becomes
more positive, instead of the cases where an increase in 1JCHf is observed, which contributes to
a larger natural charge difference between the formyl carbon and hydrogen
atoms, resulting in high estimated value of ΔVNCEC–Hf L, but any reasonable effect on 1JCHf is observed. The effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonding
on the 1H chemical shift and J between
hydroxyl and aldehydic hydrogens was previously observed by Schaefer
et al.40

For the o-nitrobenzaldehyde, 1JCHf coupling
is 18.8 Hz larger in comparison
to benzaldehyde, while for meta- and para-nitrobenzaldehydes, 1JCHf increases around 5 Hz (Table S17). The
NJC analysis for these compounds indicated that an additional increase
originated from the L term of the adjacent σC–C bond between the formyl and ipso carbons (Table 1).

The role of electrostatic
effects on 1JCHf is supported
by the correlation between the Swain–Lupton
inductive-field parameter, dubbed F parameter,41,42 and the coupling constant values of ortho-substituted
benzaldehydes (Figure S1). F is a known field-effect parameter estimated for several substituents.
Halogens and methoxy and methyl groups showed a linear correlation
with the F parameter (Figure S1B), indicating that substituent effect on the coupling constant
values may be associated with field effect transmitted through space.
Only hydroxyl and nitro substituents displayed deviations from linearity
(Figure S1A). The stability of syn-conformer by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, as mentioned
above, is the reason of deviation observed for hydroxyl substituent,
while contributions of σC–C bond increase
the 1JCHf and probably are
not taken into account for F value of nitro group.

Disubstituted Benzaldehydes
As in monosubstituted benzaldehydes,
for the 2,6-disubstituted benzaldehydes, an increase of around 13
Hz on experimental 1JCHf (Figure 2) was observed in
comparison to benzaldehyde. For 2,6-difluoro- and 2,6-dichlorobenzaldehydes,
only one conformer is present, while for 2-chloro-6-fluoro-, 2-bromo-6-fluoro-,
and 2-fluoro-6-iodobenzaldehydes, both syn- and anti-conformers have a similar population in equilibrium
and contribute similarly to the total theoretical 1JCHf (Table S17).

In 2,6-disubstituted benzaldehydes, there is an electronegative halogen
substituent near the formyl C–O and C–Hf bonds; therefore,
steric repulsion between C=O···X and C–Hf···X
competes. Consequently, the Hf–C–C bond angle does not
increase as in the ortho-monosubstituted benzaldehydes
(Table S18). Hence, in 2,6-disubstituted
benzaldehydes, the C–Hf bond is always spatially closer to
the adjacent substituent than in ortho-monosubstituted
compounds, resulting in a more pronounced proximity effect on the
SSCC.

In the same way as for ortho-monosubstituted
benzaldehydes,
the increase in 1JCHf occurs
on the FC term (Table S3) and is mainly
explained by the L contribution of the σC-Hf NLMO (Table S18). In addition, these
larger contributions could be also related to the increase in the s character (Figure 6a) and to VNCEC–Hf L (Figure 6b) as explained before in monosubstituted

(a) σC–Hf NLMO Lewis (L) contributions for 1JCHf and formyl carbon (Cf) s character; (b) σC–Hf NLMO L contributions for 1JCHf and L VNCE between formyl carbon and
hydrogen atoms (VNCEC–Hf L); and (c) formyl carbon (Cf) s character of σC–Hf NBO and VNCEC–Hf L.

Conclusions
This article has investigated the effects
of substituents on the 1JCHf transmission mechanism of
benzaldehyde derivatives. Most of the substituents showed a significant
increase of 10 Hz on the 1JCHf in ortho position, while small or no effects were
observed for meta and para derivatives.
Our theoretical results indicated that the spatial proximity between
C–Hf bond and substituents in ortho position
is more important for the 1JCHf transmission mechanism than the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing
character of the substituents.

Applying the NCE analysis, it
was possible to access the Lewis
natural charges of the coupled atoms and verify that the increase
in 1JCHf for ortho-substituted benzaldehydes is related to a decrease of natural charges
on carbon and an increase in hydrogen. The C–Hf bond polarization
and formyl carbon rehybridization lead to a C–Hf shortening
and indicate that the proximity interaction is an improper hydrogen
bond between the C–Hf bond and the ortho substituent.
For nitro compounds, an additional increase was observed also for
the meta and para compounds, which
originates from the Lewis term of the adjacent C–C bond between
the formyl and ipso carbons.

This work also
discussed, for the first time, the basis set effect
on NJC analysis of the FC term for the 1JCHf coupling of benzaldehydes. It was observed that the
ratio of the valence antibonding and Rydberg orbital contributions
change according to the basis set employed. Basis augmented with diffuse
functions (6-31+G*, 6-31++G**, aug-cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVTZ-J, and EPR-III)
showed significant Ry contributions, which indicates that this basis
set could not be adequate for NJC analysis, to get results with contributions
mainly distributed into the valence orbitals. This study also demonstrates
that basis sets specially developed for SSCC calculations are not
necessarily compatible with the NJC methodology being, simple basis
set without diffuse or contracted functions, less vulnerable to linear
dependence issues. The simplest dunning basis set D95 showed good
results on NJC decomposition as well as describing satisfactorily
the FC term of the investigated compounds.

Experimental and Computational
Details
NMR Measurements
The 1JCHf SSCCs of substituted benzaldehydes were measured directly
in the 1H NMR spectra using the satellite peaks from the
protons bonded to 13C. These direct measurements were possible
once the formyl signals were not overlapping with any other signal
of the compound. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded in a
Bruker Avance III spectrometer of 14.1 T equipped with a TBI probe.
All spectra were acquired with a FIDRES less than 0.2 Hz, leading
to an error around ±0.1 Hz on coupling constant measurements.
Samples were prepared as solutions of 10 mg of solute in 0.6 mL of
CDCl3.

Computational Details
All calculations
were carried
out using the Gaussian 09 package,43 unless
stated otherwise. Geometry optimizations, electronic potential, and
Gibbs free-energy calculations of benzaldehyde derivatives were carried
out by applying M06-2X functional44 and
6-311G* basis set for iodine atom and aug-cc-pVTZ for the remaining
atoms. These calculations were performed applying the SMD solvation
model45 for chloroform (ε = 4.7113).
M06-2X was the DFT selected for optimization and frequency calculations
because it is a functional designed to predict the thermochemical
properties of compounds containing main-group elements, being recommended
to obtain accurate structures and energies.44,46 All calculations were carried out using default parameters implemented
in Gaussian 09, i.e., tight convergence of 10–8 in
the SCF procedure and fine integration grid.

All SSCCs were
calculated using the default approach for SSCC that gives the four
terms of the Ramsey nonrelativistic theory: FC, spin–dipole
(SD), paramagnetic spin–orbit (PSO), and diamagnetic spin–orbit
(DSO). Theoretical 1JCHf SSCC
for benzaldehyde was calculated applying the ab initio method SOPPA(CCSD)47−49 and the Sauer’s basis set aug-cc-pVTZ-J, which have been
designed for magnetic resonance calculations. However, for all SSCC
calculations, a DFT method, which requires less computational resource,
was employed. The PBE0 method,50 which
is being used successfully on SSCC calculations,8,51−53 in combination with aug-cc-pVTZ-J basis set (6-311G*
for iodine and aug-cc-pVTZ for bromine) was chosen. This theoretical
level demonstrated good agreement with experimental results, and also,
for benzaldehyde, the results were equivalent to results obtained
with the ab initio theoretical level described above. For comparative
purpose with the NJC analysis, the SSCCs were also calculated applying
the D95 basis set (6-311G* for iodine and aug-cc-pVTZ for bromine).

We also calculated the 1JCHf changing the angle between formyl and phenyl groups (from 0 to 30°
for anti-conformer and 150 to 180° for syn-conformer) for benzaldehyde, o-chlorobenzaldehyde,
and o-nitrobenzaldehyde because the formyl group
is not coplanar to the phenyl ring for some ortho-substituted compounds. Table S1 shows
that the torsion does not significantly change the 1JCH, but the syn- and anti-conformers, in ortho-substituted
benzaldehydes, contribute with different 1JCH values to the total SSCC. Therefore, all properties
showed in this work (SSCC, NJC contributions, and NCE charges) were
weighted by the individual conformer populations (anti and syn) estimated using the Gibbs free energies.

For the NBO analysis:54 NJC, NBO, and
NCE calculations, the functional PBE0 was used in combination with
the D95 basis set, except for iodine and bromine atoms that are not
described by this basis set and, therefore, the 6-311G* and aug-cc-pVTZ
basis sets were selected, respectively. The NJC calculations were
performed using a Fermi contact spin perturbation of 0.02 au. In addition,
the basis set study for NJC analysis was conducted using three distinct
functionals (PBE, PBE0, and BHandH) in combination with the following
basis set: D95,55 6-31+G*,56,57 cc-pVDZ,58,59 6-311G**,60,61 6-311++G**,60,61 aug-cc-pVDZ,58,59,62 cc-pVTZ,58,59 aug-cc-pVTZ,58,59 aug-cc-pVTZ-J,63,64 EPR-III,65 and pcJ-2.66 As PBE0, PBE, and BHandH
are usually applied in coupling constant studies involving hydrogen
and carbon nuclei,8,51−53,67−69 we evaluated the NJC accuracy
using these functionals. For the basis set D95 and 6-311++G**, we
also evaluated the performance of the B3LYP,70,71 CAM-B3LYP,72 and OPBE73 functionals.
