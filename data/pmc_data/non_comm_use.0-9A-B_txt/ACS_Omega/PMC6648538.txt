TiO2 nanorods (NRs) have generated much interest for
both fundamental understanding of defect formation and technological
applications in energy harvesting, optoelectronics, and catalysis.
Herein, we have grown TiO2 NR films on glass substrates
using a self-seeded approach and annealed them in H2 ambient
to modify their surface defects. It has been shown that broad-band
photosensing properties of Au/self-seeded TiO2 NR/Au-based
two back-to-back Schottky junctions (SJs) for a broad wavelength of
light are much superior as compared to those of the pristine and the
control samples. Photoresponsivity values for the H2-annealed
sample are 0.42, 0.71, 0.07, and 0.08 A/W for detecting, respectively,
350, 400, 470, and 570 nm lights. Very low dark current and high photocurrent
lead to a gain value as high as 1.85 × 104 for 400
nm light. Unprecedentedly modified NR-based SJs show excellent photoresponsivity
for detecting as low as 25, 36, 48, and 28 μW/cm2 power densities of 350, 400, 470, and 570 nm lights, respectively.
It is found that Ti3+ defects play a key role in an efficient
photoelectron transfer from TiO2 to Au. Our work, for the
first time, highlights the simplicity and reveals the rationale behind
the excellent properties of Au/self-seeded TiO2 NR film/Au
back-to-back SJs.

Introduction
Capability for detecting both ultraviolet
(UV) and visible (vis)
lights can be used in applications such as display monitors, optical
communication, target identification, and remote controlling.1−5 However, because a semiconductor can only absorb or detect a light
with energy corresponding to its band gap, for both UV and vis photodetection,
one needs to combine two or more separate detection devices utilizing
two different semiconductors. Therefore, photodiodes (PDs) that can
provide a substantial dual-detectable operation for wider wavelengths
covering from UV to visible regions with the help of just one photon-detection
device instead of two individual devices are not only conceptually
ideal but also technologically indispensable because such a single
PD can eliminate the difficulties of fabrication and assembling several
detectors with individual cooling assemblies. Furthermore, dual-detectable
PDs are very alluring for advanced application areas such as medicare,
general illumination, weather monitoring, and in military.6−8 Till date, many studies on high-performance p–n junction
PDs have been carried out. For example, wide-band-gap GaN-based PDs
are only suitable for detecting UV9 and
Si-based PDs show a good performance in a specified wavelength region
ranging from visible to infrared (IR).10 A few recent reports on ZnO-composite-based PDs show that they are
able to detect both UV and visible lights, though these suffer from
a complicated device fabrication step because of its composite structure.11,12 On the contrary, simple Schottky junctions (SJs), which are the
simplest form of PDs, can satisfy the dual-detection characteristics
that have never been demonstrated till date to the best of our knowledge.

Nanostructures of wide-band-gap semiconductor TiO2 remain
very important over the last few decades because of their applications
in solar cells, photocatalysis, electrochemistry, water splitting,
hydrogen production, drug delivery, space research, photodetectors,
etc., due to their easy preparation and good chemical stability.13−21 The electronic band gaps of 3.0–3.4 eV limit their optical
absorption in the UV region of the solar spectrum with a low gain.22−24 It is well known that one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures show enhanced
surface-related properties. Especially, interaction of TiO2 surfaces with H2 has been studied for a long time.25−28 Reduction occurs when a TiO2 surface is annealed in a
H2 atmosphere under high vacuum conditions. It has been
observed that thermal treatment in H2 ambient produces
colored TiO2, changing its optical and electronic properties
toward superior performance, which has been originated mostly from
the change in the structural disorders/defects.29,30 However, TiO2 nanorod (NR) films are reported to be grown
successfully only on FTO substrates because of lattice matching (almost
98%).31 FTO, being a costly substrate,
again the FTO/TiO2 structure becomes costly. Therefore,
in this article, we have grown self-seeded NR films of TiO2 on ordinary glass substrates using a pulsed-laser-deposited (PLD)
thin seed layer of TiO2. This technique can be addressed
as the first attempt till date to grow TiO2 NR films on
glass substrates to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, we have
modified the surface of TiO2 NR films by annealing them
in H2 ambient under high vacuum to modify the surface defects
and investigated photosensing properties of two back-to-back SJs.
It has been shown that the photodetection properties of Au/self-seeded
TiO2 NR film-based SJs are much superior to those of pristine
and only-vacuum-annealed TiO2 NR films (control samples).
The photoresponsivity values for H2-annealed NR film-based
SJs are 0.42, 0.71, 0.07, and 0.08 A/W for detecting lights of 350,
400, 470, and 570 nm wavelengths, respectively, which are excellent
as broad-band light detection. Here, the contrast between the low
value of the dark current and the high value of the photocurrent makes
this particular SJ a very attractive one with a high gain value of
1.85 × 104, the highest among the other reported ones.
Not only this, the H2-annealed NR films show excellent
photoresponsivity values for detecting as low as 25, 36, 48, and 28
μW/cm2 power densities of broad-band lights of 350,
400, 470, and 570 nm wavelengths, respectively, which has not been
reported for TiO2 NR-based photodetectors till date to
the best of our knowledge. Therefore, this work presents two-fold
novelty, a simple self-seeded growth strategy of TiO2 NR
films over a glass substrate and excellent broad-band photosensitivity
with high responsivity values of Au/self-seeded TiO2 NR
film/Au back-to-back SJs.

Results and Discussion
Structural, Elemental,
and Spectroscopic Characteristics
The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern of the PLD seed layer grown on
a glass substrate (S0) is shown in Figure 1a with the diffraction peaks corresponding
to the (110), (200), (210), (211), and (220) peaks of the rutile phase,
whereas a single peak at ∼37.5° corresponds to the (004)
peak of the anatase phase of TiO2. Therefore, the seed
layer contains a mixed phase but is dominated by the rutile phase,
which was observed earlier by Kitazawa et al.32Figure 1b shows similar
XRD peaks for the rutile phase, whereas the intensity of the (004)
peak assigned to the anatase phase is decreased for as-grown NR films
(S1) grown over the seed layer, indicating more dominance of the rutile
phase for the hydrothermally grown NR films. After annealing in vacuum
(S2) and in H2 ambient (S3), the patterns remain almost
similar, whereas the intensity of the peaks for the rutile phase increases
with a complete absence of the anatase phase for the S3 sample. This
is similar to the results of Soo et al.,33 who had also found the dominance of the rutile phase over the anatase
phase after annealing in a H2 atmosphere at a temperature
above 300 °C. The full width at half-maximum value for S1 is
0.48, whereas for S2 and S3, the values are 0.35 and 0.36, respectively,
which indicates a better crystallinity of S2 and S3 samples over S1
because of annealing.

samples in the illumination range of 400–500 nm are shown.

respectively.

The UV–vis absorbance
spectra of NR films (S1, S2, and S3)
plotted in Figure 1c show a gradual increase in the absorption value from 600 nm, whereas
the UV–vis absorbance spectrum of S0 shown in Figure 1d shows a sharp rise in the
absorption value below 370 nm because of band edge absorption of TiO2. In Figure 1c, S3 shows a significant enhancement in the absorption value in
the UV region as compared with S1 and S2 and also shows an increased
visible light absorption in the wavelength region of 500–400
nm, which is shown in the inset of Figure 1c. An increased absorption both in the UV
and vis light regions after hydrogenation as compared to that in pristine
ones was also observed by He et al.27 and
Wang et al.34 This increase in absorbance
is considered to be a result of the presence of some disordered states,
which may create some mid-gap states and narrow the band gap. The
FESEM image of the TiO2 NR array film shown in Figure 1e shows a quasi-vertical
nature of the NR array film. From the magnified image of the NR films
(Figure 1f), the average
diameter of the NRs is found to be ∼50–60 nm and are
not vertical but interconnected.

A representative comparison
of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectra of S3 and S1 samples in Figure 2a shows peaks due to the Ti 2p (2p3/2 and 2p1/2) state and in Figure 2c shows peaks due to the O 1s (1s) state.
S1 shows the presence of two symmetrical peaks due to the Ti4+–O bond in the Ti 2p spectrum at ∼458.6 eV for Ti 2p3/2 and at ∼464 eV for Ti 2p1/2.35 In contrast to S1, the S3 sample distinctly
shows two asymmetric peaks with two distinct shoulders toward lower
binding energies. In Figure 2b, the Ti 2p3/2 peak signal for S3 is nicely fitted
with three peaks. Two peaks at ∼457.2 and 455.8 eV are due
to Ti3+ and Ti2+, respectively, apart from the
peak at 458.6 eV due to Ti4+. Therefore, our XPS results
clearly indicate that, after reduction, both Ti3+ and Ti2+ appear, which has also been reported earlier by Singh et
al.26 and Lu et al.36 Appearance of the defect states after hydrogenation has
also been indicated in the previous studies.37−39 Furthermore,
there is a change in the O 1s peak shape of S1 and S3. The O 1s peaks
in Figure 2d,e are
deconvoluted into two peaks, one (P1)
at ∼530 eV due to lattice O2– (Ti–O–Ti
bond) and another (P2) at ∼531 eV due to surface
hydroxyl (Ti-OH). The ratios of peak areas of P2 to P1 values for both S1 and
S3 samples are similar. This indicates further that there is no change
in the surface-adsorbed OH groups due to H2 annealing.
Chen et al.40 have also reported no change
in the Ti-OH signal in the XPS spectra after H2 annealing.

Dark Current Density (Jd)–Voltage
(V) Characteristics
Two lateral Au contacts
on top of TiO2 NR films consist of an Au/TiO2 junction connected in series, resulting in back-to-back two junctions.
Ideally, both the junctions should form Schottky contacts and hence
the nonlinear J–V curves
should be obtained for the fabricated Au/TiO2/Au back-to-back
SJs. The nonlinearity is expected to stem from the Au/TiO2 junction, which has been reported earlier by Chakrabartty et al.41 and Karaagac et al.42 However, Figure 3a shows that S0 (seed layer) exhibits almost symmetric and linear Jd–V characteristics,
indicating an almost zero junction barrier height. The linear and
symmetric behavior observed in the J–V characteristics around V = 0 originates
from the trap-populated TiO2 surface layer adjacent to
the interface, as observed by others.43 It has been shown previously that a high VO concentration
can break the interface barrier in M/TiO2 junctions.44 Our results indicate that the PLD seed layer
contains abundant surface trap states (probably VO) because
of a deposition condition of high vacuum (i.e., nonavailability of
O2) in the growth chamber. Therefore, the zero barrier
height is attributed to the electron leakage through the traps in
the carrier-depleted region of the TiO2 layer adjacent
to the junction and thus the current becomes independent of the barrier
height established at the junction.45 This
is because, in complex junctions, charge carriers choose the lowest
barrier/resistance path and, hence, the J–V characteristic of the junction is expected to approximately
indicate the minimum barrier height built up at the junction. Thermal
annealing in air compensates the VO defects and increases
the O2 concentration at the interface, which causes a barrier
setup. In fact, we could not measure the J–V curve for an air-annealed sample because of its very low
current value (less than pA). Figure 3b shows the Jd–V curves of S1, S2, and S3, where the curve for S2 is multiplied
by a factor 50 for better clarity. The Jd–V curve for S1 is distinctly asymmetric
and rectifying on both sides of V = 0, indicating
the formation of junction interface barriers, as indicated by the
asymmetric J–V even though
two symmetric contacts (Au) have been used.45 In the forward bias condition, the barrier height is much higher
than that expected from the difference in the electronegativity value
of anatase and/or rutile TiO2 and the work function of
Au. This result is consistent with the reported independence of the
height of the junction barrier formed on TiO2 by various
metals.45 For Au/TiO2, however,
these numerical values lead to a barrier height approximately around
0.4 eV.43 A much higher barrier value in
our case indicates a complex junction nature. In the reverse bias
condition, the barrier height is even higher because of slow release
of carriers from the interface trap states.46,47 It appears that higher levels of O2 coverage occur on
the Au surface at the junction. For annealed samples S2 and S3, the
barrier height gradually becomes lower as compared to that of S1.
To better understand the difference in the interfacial barrier, we
also have to bear in mind that intermediate thin oxide layers of a
few nanometers may be formed at Au/TiO2 interfaces,48 especially on samples exposed to environmental
conditions.49 Further to this, some induction
of VO, acting as equivalent to doping, is also expected.45 These processes result in the formation of an
effective barrier with a height that deviates from the expected theoretical
predictions. Therefore, in present junction cases, the observed Schottky
barriers cannot be described on the basis of the commonly used concept
that the junction barrier height is equivalent to the difference between
the metal work function and semiconductor electron affinity. From
the Jd–V curves,
it is evident that S1 shows the lowest Jd, whereas the value increases slightly as the sample is annealed
in vacuum condition (S2) and the enhancement is ∼6 times at
−4 V when the sample is annealed in H2 ambient (S3).
Therefore, the difference between S1 and S2 is probably due to vacuum-generated
vacancies and the difference between S1 and S3 is due to Ti3+ at the surface of the TiO2 layer during the annealing
process.37,50 Ti3+ forms a band below the conduction
band minima.51 In wide-band-gap materials,
the conductivity is also determined by the properties of the gap states
through mechanisms such as hopping and Poole–Frenkel effects.
Nevertheless, a thorough investigation of the conduction mechanism
through the NR films is not our main focus in this work.

samples. The S2 curve is multiplied by a factor of 50.

Wavelength-Dependent Photoresponse
To investigate the
wavelength-dependent optoelectric behavior, the photocurrent spectrum
of the samples has been recorded by varying the wavelengths of the
illumination from 800 to 300 nm at a fixed bias voltage of −4
V, as shown in Figure 4a. S1 and S2 show a rise in the photocurrent only below 430 nm with
the highest Jph observed at ∼400
nm illumination. However, S3 shows a considerable photoresponse in
the wavelength region of 400–700 nm with two maxima at ∼470
and ∼570 nm wavelengths apart from a sharp peak at ∼400
nm, indicating a broad-band photoresponse. The wavelength-dependent
responsivity (Rλ) and
detectivity (D) have been calculated using the standard
formulas 1   2  where Jph is the
photocurrent density, P is the power density of illumination,
and q is the charge of an electron. The inset in Figure 4a shows the detectivity
values of ∼3 × 109, 7 × 109, and 68 × 109 Jones for 400 nm illumination for
S1, S2, and S3, respectively. For S3, visible illumination detectivity
values at 470 and 570 nm wavelengths are ∼6 × 109 and 8 × 109 Jones, respectively, which are higher
than the highest detectivity values achieved by S1 and S2. In Figure 4b, the wavelength-dependent
responsivity curve shows a clear hump in a region of 500–700
nm with a maximum centered at 570 nm for the S3 sample. Figure 4b also indicates that S3 has
much higher photoresponsivity values in the entire 350–800
nm region as compared with S1 and S2.

In the inset, wavelength-dependent
detectivity spectra of the three samples are shown. (b) Wavelength-dependent
responsivity spectra of TiO2 NR films (S1, S2, and S3).

Photocurrent Density (Jph)–V Characteristics
To investigate the response of
the samples to a light of single wavelength chosen from the detectable
wide UV to visible range, four reference wavelengths of illumination,
that is, 350, 400, 470, and 570 nm, have been selected and their corresponding Jph–V curves are shown
in Figure 5. In Figure 5a, the Jph–V curve of the S0 sample is
shown, where the photocurrent values for all four wavelengths show
Ohmic behavior and the values are not much different from the dark
current values. In Figure 5b–d, the NR film samples (S1, S2, and S3, respectively)
show photoresponse to all four chosen wavelengths as evidenced from
the Jph–V curves,
which maintain Schottky junction behavior with a much lower barrier
height of the Au/TiO2 junction. This is due to the fact
that Jph is dominated by the photogenerated
carriers in the TiO2-depleted region under illumination,
which is explained through the model in Figure 6. In each of Figure 5b–d, the highest photocurrent has
been observed for 400 nm illumination.

TiO2 NR films in the depleted region when negatively biased:

The schematic (Figure 6) shows that the excitons are generated in
the depleted region
after illumination and the photoelectrons easily reach the electrode
(Au) via Ti3+ defect states. In the above diagram, conduction
band minima and valence band maxima are denoted CB and VB, where forward
and reverse bias are labeled as FB and RB, respectively.

Transient Photoresponse
Characteristics
Detailed investigation
on the photoresponse properties of the samples has been carried out
by recording the transient photoresponse for 10 min under illumination
of all four reference wavelengths 350, 400, 470, and 570 nm (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Photocurrent transient
spectra of NR film samples (S1, S2, and
S3) at wavelengths (a) 350 nm, (b) 400 nm, (c) 470 nm, and (d) 570
nm. The shaded regions in the graphs denote the illumination period.

After analyzing the transient
curves, the values of the dark and
photocurrent densities, corresponding gain (calculated as the ratio
of photo-to-dark current density), responsivity, and detectivity for
detecting lights of different wavelengths have been noted in Table 1.

and S3 of NR films for Detecting Lights of Different Wavelengths

570	5.9 × 101	1.7 × 103	7.8 × 101	7.5	
The values of gain, responsivity, and detectivity
are the highest
for detecting 400 nm light for all NR film samples. Table 1 clearly reveals that S3 has
the highest values of all of the photoresponse parameters for all
four detecting wavelengths among the TiO2 NR films. The
responsivity values of S3 for detecting 350, 400, and 470 nm lights
increase by more than 1 order of magnitude, whereas for detecting
570 nm, it increases by more than 2 orders of magnitude as compared
to that of control samples (S1 and S2), indicating wide and much superior
photoresponse properties of S3 for broad-band light detection in the
UV–visible region. The enhanced photoconductivity in the visible
region caused by Ti3+ defect states situated below conduction
band minima is due to an efficient electron transfer through defect
sites. Paul et al.52 also find enhanced
photoresponse in visible illumination because of enhancement of defect
states in TiO2 NRs.

Power Dependence of Photocurrent
Transients for 400 nm
As the highest responsivity has been
achieved for 400 nm for all
of the samples, power-dependent photocurrent transients are measured
by varying the power density of 400 nm illumination from 880 to 36
μW/cm2 at a fixed bias voltage of −4 V (Figure 8). All three NR film
samples (S1, S2, and S3) show an enhanced photocurrent as the power
is increased gradually. Power law fitting (Jph ∝ Pα, where P is the power density of illumination and α is the
coefficient of power density) of NR film samples in 400 nm illumination
is shown in Figure 8d, which reveals that the photocurrent of S1 and S2 varies sublinearly
for both lower and higher power illuminations, whereas the α
value is more in S2 than in S1. A similar result is found by Mondal
et al.53 after vacuum annealing of TiO2 NP thin films. Interestingly, the photocurrents for S3 vary
superlinearly and slightly sublinearly, respectively, for the lower
and higher power illuminations, though for both cases, the values
are much higher than those of S1 and S2. This result indicates that
photogenerated charge separation in S3 is much efficient because of
the Ti3+ defect states as compared with the control samples.

irradiation of (a) S1, (b) S2, and (c) S3. The shaded region in the
graphs denotes the illumination period. (d) Corresponding power law
fitting curves and the inset showing the slopes of individual samples.

Power Dependence of Broad-Band
Photoresponse
As the
S3 sample shows a very high photoresponse in a broad wavelength region,
to check its suitability as a broad-band photodetector with low power
detectivity, power dependence of the photocurrent transients has been
investigated for 350, 470, and 570 nm illuminations, which are plotted
in Figure 9. The corresponding
power law fitting is plotted in the inset of each figure. Similar
to the case of 400 nm, for other detectable illuminations also, the
photocurrent increases as the power of illumination increases. In
350 nm illumination, when the power density decreases from 570 to
25 μW/cm2, the responsivity value also decreases
from 0.42 to 0.16 A/W. However, the responsivity values are 0.07 and
0.08 A/W, respectively, for the highest power densities of 1.28 and
0.76 mW/cm2 for detecting 470 and 570 nm illuminations,
which are quite high. Even for the lowest illumination powers of 48
μW/cm2 (470 nm) and 28 μW/cm2 (570
nm), S3 shows very high responsivity values of 4.15 and 6.3 mA/W,
respectively. These results indicate interesting properties of S3
for low-power as well as broad-band SJ-based photodetection. However,
unless a hybrid material system is taken, it is difficult to obtain
almost equal response in both the UV and the visible region using
a single semiconducting material because at the expense of one (band
(VB)-to-band (CB) excitation leading to UV region current) the other
(defect state-to-conduction band excitation leading to visible region
current) occurs. Interestingly, in comparison with the pristine sample
(S1), the enhancement of responsivity of S3 in the UV illumination
(400 nm) is ∼50 times and in the visible illumination (570
nm) is ∼200 times. The ratio of responsivity values in visible
illumination (570 nm) to those in UV illumination (400 nm) for S3
is ∼0.11, whereas for S1, the value is ∼0.03. It is
always better to be able to detect lower-intensity lights than higher-intensity
lights. In our case, lower-intensity visible lights are better detected
by the S3 sample.

(a) 350 nm, (b) 470 nm, and (c) 570 nm illuminations. The shaded region
in the graphs denotes the illumination period. Corresponding power
law fitting curves with power law coefficient (α) as a slope
are shown in the inset.

To evaluate the stability of the best-performed sample (S3)
in
the wide spectral range, transient photoresponse cycle measurements
for 350, 400, 470, and 570 nm have been performed, and the results
are shown in Figure 10a–d. In almost all cycles, the highest photocurrent density
remains similar with only 5% change. Therefore, it is quite clear
from the figures that the photodetection property of S3 is quite stable.

of our Au/TiO2 NR film/Au
SJs with that reported in other studies wherein TiO2 nanostructures
have been used is shown in Table 2.

Table 2 reveals
that our Au/TiO2 NR film-based SJ is not only operating
for a broad-band range with higher responsivity values as compared
with other reported values but also capable of detecting lights of
low intensity, which adds an extra benchmark for the present Au/TiO2/Au SJs. However, Zheng et al.60 have reported a very high responsivity value for a detectable wavelength
of 365 nm, which is improbable.

Conclusions
In
summary, the photosensitivity of SJs based on H2-annealed
self-seeded TiO2 NRs is reported. Due to annealing in H2 under high vacuum, Ti3+ surface defects below
the conduction band minima of TiO2 arise, contributing
not only to a high value of responsivity but also to a detection of
a broad-band photo in Au/self-seeded TiO2 NR film/Au SJs.
Detection of lights of UV to visible regions as well as with a very
low power of <50 μW/cm2 with high responsivity
values, which is not reported earlier, makes this SJ a probable candidate
for a low-cost efficient broad-band photodetector.

Experimental
Section
TiO2 NR films were hydrothermally grown
on ordinary
glass substrates. First, the glass substrates were properly cleaned
for deposition of the seed layer. A TiO2 pellet (purity
∼99.9%, Merck) was mounted in a target holder of the PLD chamber
(Neocera) fitted with a KrF excimer laser (Coherent) with an emission
wavelength of 248 nm. TiO2 film deposition was done on
a cleaned glass substrate, maintaining the substrate temperature at
500 °C. The laser energy was 330 mJ/pulse with a repetition of
10 Hz.

To make a precursor of TiO2, a homogeneous
clear mixture
of distilled water and HCL (37%) in 1:1 ratio was stirred for 20 min
and 50 mM titanium butoxide was then added into the mixture. Next,
the seeded substrates were put into a Teflon-lined stainless steel
autoclave containing the precursor solution. During growth, the autoclave
was maintained at 150 °C for 12 h. After completion, the samples
were taken out, cleaned by gently spraying water onto them, and put
into an oven to dry at 120 °C. This as-grown sample was labeled
as S1. Next, a sample was annealed at 400 °C in vacuum for 1
h, named S2, and another sample was annealed at 400 °C for 1
h in H2 ambient (10% H2 and 90% Ar), named S3.
Therefore, S1 and S2 are the control samples, whereas S3 is the sample
under test. The seed layer is termed as S0.

The TiO2 NR films were characterized by various analytic
and spectroscopic techniques using X-ray diffractometry (XRD; model
X’pert pro, PANalytical), UV–vis spectrophotometry (PerkinElmer
model Lamda 35), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Omicron, serial
no.: 0571), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM,
JEOL; JSM-7500F). For photoconductivity measurement, two 70 nm thick
Au (2 mm diameter) contacts were deposited through a mask on the films,
wherein the illuminated area confined in between two contacts is 4
mm2. The coating of Au contacts is done by a vacuum coating
unit (Hind Hivac 12″ vacuum coating unit; model 12A4D). Films
were kept in the dark for several hours to reach an equilibrium dark
current value. As an illumination source, a Xe lamp (Newport; model
66902) fitted with a monochromator was used. The power density of
each illumination falling on the sample is measured by a power meter
(Newport; model 1930C), exactly maintaining a similar position and
other measurement conditions.

Photocurrent measurements between
two contacts were performed using
a Keithley source meter, model 2410, and a GPIB data transfer card.
A schematic is shown in Figure 11 to show the formation and measurement of photoconductivity
of the Au/self-seeded TiO2 NR film/Au SJs.

junctions (SJs).
