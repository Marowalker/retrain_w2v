Samples were pretreated by ultrasound
at 300 W and 28 kHz in three
different solutions. The thermal degradation characteristics of the
samples were then characterized via thermogravimetric, differential
scanning calorimetry, and Fourier transform infrared analysis in a
nitrogen environment. The characteristic of gas product release, the
formation mechanisms of the main products, and the mechanistic basis
for the effects of ultrasound on wood components were studied. The
results showed that the gaseous products are the same with ultrasound
pretreatment but the amounts are changed. The gaseous products mainly
constitute of CO, H2O, CO2, CH4,
and CH3COOH, and more gaseous products were produced at
361 °C than at 308 °C. The reaction rates for specimens
pretreated in aqueous soda solution proceeded faster than specimens
pretreated in aqueous acetic acid solution and distilled water. Moreover,
the maximum FTIR spectra absorbance appeared around 341 °C for
specimens pretreated in aqueous soda solution but appeared around
369 °C for the control sample and samples pretreated in distilled
water or acetic acid solution. The heat flows for specimens pretreated
in aqueous soda solution, compared to control group, was much lower.
Additionally, hydroxyl and hydroperoxy radicals provided by ultrasound
cavitation in alkaline conditions act to intensify the overall rates
of reactions.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Wood, as one kind of renewable
biomass resource, can be used to
solve the energy shortage in worldwide.1,2 At present,
a significant amount of timber is used in the wood industry, and much
wood waste is generated during furniture manufacturing and by the
building industries. However, most wooden waste, at present, is combusted
or abandoned directly, which contribute to rather severe environmental
pollution. To solve such problem, wood waste could be converted to
cellulosic material and thus improve its value. However, the structure
of wood, which mainly consist of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin,3 is very complex,4 and
it is difficult to process wood waste with low cost in a short time
period.5 Wooden waste pretreatment is one
of the best ways to modify wood structure and change the characteristics
of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.6,7 At present,
many pretreatments were used to facilitate the thermal conversion
of wooden material, such as acid pretreatment,8 hot water pretreatment,9 torrefaction
pretreatment,10 ionic liquid pretreatment,11 and so on. However, the existing methods could
not be applied widely considering the cost and efficiency. Ultrasound
with the characteristics of cavitation, sponge effect, and so on can
generate high temperature and high pressure in liquid medium and induce
wood chemical and physical transformation.12,13 Ultrasound pretreatment also can break down the lignin, remove hemicelluloses,
and allow pretreatment chemicals to reach and increase cellulose nanocrystal
accessibility.14,15 Thus, ultrasonic treatment is
an interesting option for lignocellulosic pretreatment to facilitate
the thermal conversion.16,17 Moreover, the choice
of medium also has significant influence on wood ultrasound pretreatment.15 Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the effects
of ultrasound pretreatment on wood thermal decomposition characteristics
under different conditions.

Additionally, thermal decomposition
of biomass is the fundamental
process of biomass thermal conversion and can be quantitatively measured
by thermogravimetric, differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier
transform infrared (TG–DSC–FTIR) analysis. This provides
useful data on the gas-product-evolution process and to elucidate
the mechanism of wood pyrolysis.18−21 In this study, TG–DSC–FTIR
analysis was used to determine the effects of ultrasound pretreatment
on wood thermal decomposition characteristics under different conditions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Materials Characterization
The proximate
analysis as dry basis (db) and ultimate analysis as dry ash-free (daf)
basis of the samples were measured as shown in Table 1. The control and pretreated specimens were
grinded to smaller than 100-mesh and dried at 105 °C for at least
2 h before analysis. The C, H, and N contents were calculated by an
Elementar Vario EL III. The O content was obtained by the difference.
A muffle furnace was used to measure the content of volatile matter,
fixed carbon, and ash. All analyses were performed in triplicate.

2.2 Gas Product
Release Characteristics of Wood
Samples
The differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curves of
specimens pretreated by ultrasound under different conditions are
shown in Figure 1.
It indicates that the peak of decomposition for specimens pretreated
by ultrasound in aqueous soda solution is around 341 °C and those
for the control sample and samples pretreated in distilled water or
acetic acid solution are around 308 and 361 °C.

pretreated by ultrasound in different conditions.

An FTIR spectrometer was used to analyze the volatile emission
characteristic during the thermal degradation process. On the basis
of the widely used Lambert–Beer law and the existing research
studies,22−24 the absorption spectrum intensity at a specific wavenumber
is linearly dependent on gas concentration.25 Thus, the variation of absorbance during thermal degradation reflects
the concentration trend of the gas species.26Figure 2 demonstrates
the FTIR spectra of the thermal degradation gases of wood pretreated
in different solutions at the indicated temperatures. For all specimens,
the absorption bands of volatile appeared at the same wavenumbers,
but there were some differences in the absorbance peaks. It means
that the different thermal degradation products vary in amounts but
not in identity. Qualitative analysis indicates that the production
of compounds could be classified into two kinds. The noncondensable
gases contain CO (2183 cm–1), CO2 (2360,
669 cm–1), and CH4 (2817 cm–1), and the condensable gases contain water (3964–3500 cm–1 and 1650–1300 cm–1), mainly
generated by the evaporation of free water and absorbed water in material
and the cracking of aliphatic hydroxyl groups in the lateral chains,27 ketones (1260–1145 cm–1) and acids, or CH3COOH in the IR spectra data-base.26,28 Additionally, HCN and NH3 were also found in the FTIR
spectra20,29 but at low amounts. The formation of gaseous
products at 361 °C was much stronger than that at 308 °C,
perhaps because when thermal degradation progresses into the first
stage, more gaseous products are released.27 Additionally, compared to the control group, specimens pretreated
in acetic acid solution or in distilled water showed little effect
of pretreatment time and conditions on the amount of gaseous products.
However, more gaseous products were produced for specimens pretreated
in the aqueous soda solution, these results are likely because in
alkaline solutions, the sodium can catalyze devolatilization reactions3,7 and physical and chemical effects of ultrasound on wood component.

solutions.

2.3 Formation
Mechanisms of Main Products
Different gases are detected
in different FTIR zones according to
their main FTIR spectra. The evolution profiles of CH3COOH,
CO, CO2, and CH4 are shown in Figure 3. The gas products varied with
temperature for specimens pretreated in different solutions. CH3COOH, which is most likely generated by cellulose and hemicellulose
pyrolysis,30 appears starting at 250 °C
and peaks around 343 °C for specimens pretreated in aqueous soda
solution. In contrast, in the control samples and the samples pretreated
in distilled water or acetic acid solution, the CH3COOH
appeared around 250 °C and peaked around 366 °C. The lower
temperature for samples pretreated in aqueous soda solution might
be for the reason of the removal of alkali metals such as calcium
and magnesium, which have negligible influence on the thermal degradation
of cellulose and hemicellulose15 and the
addition of sodium carbonate, which can catalyze devolatilization
reactions.2,3,15 The temperature
range of CO2 production was from 200 to 400 °C for
all conditions and with a peak at 345 °C for specimens pretreated
in aqueous soda solution and with two peaks at 296 and 366 °C,
respectively, for the control one and specimens pretreated in distilled
water and acetic acid solution. Additionally, the evolution of CO
starting at 250 °C is higher than that of CO2. The
maximum absorbance appeared around 336 °C for specimens pretreated
in aqueous soda solution but appeared at 200 °C and peaked around
369 °C for the control sample and samples pretreated in distilled
water or acetic acid solution. This suggests that the CO2 produced in biomass pyrolysis is mainly due to hemicellulose thermal
decomposition and the breaking of lateral C–C bonds,27 but CO is most likely generated by cellulose
pyrolysis and by the breaking of lateral chains in lignin polymers,
such as the aliphatic hydroxyl group and C–C bond.31 Our data agreed well with previous results.1 CH4 is formed from the cracking of
methyl radicals in lignin15 and weakly
bonded methoxy groups,26 and was evident
starting at 200 °C and concentration around 341 °C.

2.4 DSC Analysis
The DSC curves for specimens
pretreated in different solutions are shown in Figure 4. There was a significant endothermic process
for all specimens, and the reaction of specimens pretreated in aqueous
soda solution occurred in a lower temperature region (309–400
°C) than for specimens pretreated in aqueous acetic acid (328–428
°C), distilled water (321–424 °C), or the control
group (312–442 °C). Additionally, the data also shows
that, compared to the control group, the heat flow for specimens pretreated
in aqueous soda solution was much lower. Moreover, the reaction rates
for specimens pretreated in aqueous soda solution was faster than
the specimens pretreated in aqueous acetic acid and distilled water,
and there were no significant differences for specimens pretreated
for different amounts of time (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 h). These results
are likely because in alkaline solutions both physical and chemical
effects of ultrasound and cavitation can promote to delignification.32 Additionally, sodium carbonate was able to enter
samples,33 and the sodium can catalyze
devolatilization reactions.3,7,34

curves for pretreated and control specimens.

2.5 Influencing Mechanism of Ultrasound on Wood
Our findings show that ultrasound pretreatment in different solutions
has a significant effect on the wood thermal decomposition characteristics,
especially for wood pretreated in aqueous soda solution. Wood consists
mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, and we propose the
following mechanism for the effects of wood pretreatment by hydrodynamic
cavitation in alkaline conditions, and the mechanism also is shown
in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Influencing
mechanism of ultrasound on wood.

Ultrasound cavitation generates high pressure and temperature
during
the pretreatment process,13 promoting the
decomposition of water molecules into OH• and H•.35 These OH• radicals are highly reactive and may facilitate the oxidation of
cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin molecules. Under alkaline conditions,
the oxidation potential (reactivity) of the hydroxyl radicals decreases
and recombination occurs between hydroxyl radicals to form hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2), and this H2O2 can be separated to generate hydroperoxy radical under alkaline
conditions, and HOO• can react again with the residual
H2O2 to generate highly reactive superoxide
(O2•)
and OH•. The cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin
molecules react with themselves or with the hydroperoxy (HOO•) and hydroxyl (OH•) radicals formed during ultrasound
cavitation to form carbon dioxide, organic acids, and other low molecular
weight organic products by side chain elimination, ring opening, and
other processes.17,36−39

3 Conclusions
Ultrasound pretreatment is an effective technique to modify the
thermal decomposition characteristics of wood. The peak of decomposition
for specimens pretreated by ultrasound in aqueous soda solution is
around 341 °C, while those for the control sample and samples
pretreated in distilled water or acetic acid solution are around 308
and 361 °C. Ultrasound pretreatment influences the amounts, but
not the kinds, of gaseous products: the absorption bands of volatile
species are at the same wavenumbers for all the specimens. The gaseous
products mainly constitute of CO, H2O, CO2,
CH4, CH3COOH, and ether, and more gaseous products
were produced at 361 °C than at 308 °C. Pretreatment time
and conditions showed little effect on the amount of gaseous products
for specimens pretreated in acetic acid solution or in distilled water,
but a higher amount of gaseous products were produced for specimens
pretreated in aqueous soda solution. Additionally, gas products varied
with temperature, with different production patterns of CH3COOH for the different samples. The process was endothermic for all
the specimens, and the specimens pretreated in aqueous soda solution
reacted over lower temperatures (309–400 °C) than specimens
pretreated in aqueous acetic acid (328–428 °C), distilled
water (321–424 °C), or the control group (312–442
°C). The reaction rate was faster for the specimens pretreated
in aqueous soda solution compared to those with other pretreatment
conditions. Additionally, compared to the control group, the heat
flow for specimens pretreated in aqueous soda solution was much lower.
Finally, the treatment of wood using alkaline conditions combined
with hydrodynamic cavitation provides additional hydroxyl and hydroperoxy
radicals to promote the degradation reaction and intensity the overall
rates of reactions.

4 Material and Methods
4.1 Material
Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis × Eucalyptus
urophylla), a fast-growing wood in China that was
provided by YuXiang Wood Products Co., Ltd, GuangXi, China, was taken
as specimen. The samples were grinded to less than 0.5 mm in diameter
in a grinder and then dried in a chamber for 24 h at the temperature
of 103 °C.

4.2 Ultrasound Pretreatment
During the
pretreatment process, the sample was put into distilled water, aqueous
acetic acid (with the volume fraction of 50%), and aqueous soda solution
(with the mass fraction of 7.5%), respectively, and then samples were
pretreated by ultrasound with the power of 300 W and the frequency
of 28 kHz (model VGT-2200A, Cheng-Cheng Ultrasonics, Beijing, China)
for 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 h, respectively. After treatment, the samples
were filtrated, washed, and then dried at the temperature of 100 ±
3 °C to the oven dry.30

4.3 TG–DSC–FTIR Analysis
A TG analyzer (Netzsch
STA449F3, Germany) coupled with a differential
scanning calorimeter and a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
(a TG–DSC–FTIR system) was used to compare the decomposition,
gas release, and thermal characteristics of the untreated and treated
eucalyptus powder samples using a heating rate of 10 °C/min and
a final temperature of 900 °C in a nitrogen environment.40
