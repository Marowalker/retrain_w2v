The
optimization of an organoaluminum catalytic system for the
copolymerization of epoxides and anhydrides is presented. For this
purpose, the influence of different variables in the process, such
as catalysts, cocatalyst, solvent, or substrates, has been analyzed.
Kinetic studies, a proposal for the catalytic mechanism, and full
characterization of the copolymers obtained are also discussed. Finally,
a new copolymer, poly(limonene succinate), obtained by the optimized
catalytic system is reported.

Introduction
Biodegradable polymeric
materials derived from renewable and bioderived
resources are a potential alternative to petroleum-based plastics.1−5 Amongst them, biodegradable polyesters such as polylactide (PLA)
and polycaprolactone (PCL) have already found many applications.6−10 These polymers are often obtained by ring-opening polymerization
(ROP) of cyclic esters catalyzed by organometallic complexes11−21 and organocatalysts.22−28 However, the design of new biodegradable polyester architectures
with improved properties by ROP is seriously restricted by the limited
number of commercially available cyclic esters. The development of
other catalytic processes for the preparation of a broader range of
biodegradable polyesters is necessary.

A promising alternative
is the ring-opening copolymerization (ROCOP)
of epoxides and cyclic anhydrides. This methodology could expand the
scope of biodegradable polyesters because of the large number of epoxides
and cyclic anhydrides commercially available (Scheme 1).29−31 The main drawbacks of this process
are still the low molecular weight of the obtained polymers and the
modest selectivity of the catalysts tested. In the search of better
catalysts for the development of biodegradable architectures, systems
based on zinc,32−36 cobalt,37−39 chromium,40−43 and aluminum44−47 have been thoroughly studied. Amongst them, aluminum
complexes are the most attractive because of its Earth’s crust
abundancy.

Scheme 1 ROCOP of Epoxides and Cyclic Anhydrides
In this matter, our research
group has significantly contributed
to the development of novel aluminum complexes as catalysts for a
considerable range of catalytic processes (Chart 1).48−57 A family of aluminum catalysts supported by heteroscorpionate ligands
were developed for the ROP of cyclic esters55,56,58 (Chart 1a). On the other hand, neutral bi-57 and trimetallic54 (Chart 1b,c) and bifunctional48,50 (Chart 1d,e) aluminum
complexes have been reported as catalysts for the formation of cyclic
carbonates from epoxides and carbon dioxide.

Chart 1 Scorpionate Aluminum
Catalysts
Recently, novel scorpionate
aluminum complexes have been reported
as versatile catalysts for the ROP of cyclic esters and ROCOP of cyclohexene
oxide (CHO) and phthalic anhydride (PA) (Scheme 2).49 The most
active catalyst allowed us to obtain poly(cyclohexene phthalate) with
an excellent selectivity. Therefore, on the basis of these results,
in this work, we expand our studies on the use of aluminum complexes
as catalysts for the ROCOP of a wider range of epoxides and cyclic
anhydrides including bioderived limonene oxide (LO) in order to prepare
a broader range of polyester materials including poly(limonene succinate)
which has not been previously reported. Moreover, NMR experiments
and a kinetic study have been carried out in order to better understand
the catalytic process.

of CHO and PA
Results and Discussion
ROCOP
of Epoxides and Cyclic Anhydrides
Mono- and bimetallic
alkyl aluminum complexes 1–4 (Chart 2) were prepared in excellent
yields as previously reported57,58 and tested as catalysts
for the ROCOP of CHO and succinic anhydride (SA) using 1 mol % of
aluminum loading at 80 °C in toluene as a solvent (Scheme 3), and the results are shown
in Table 1.

First, we
investigated the ROCOP process in the absence of a cocatalyst
(Table 1, entries 1–4),
and the results showed that good conversions with low selectivities
were obtained. Because previous reports confirmed that adding a nucleophile
source as a cocatalyst increased the copolymerization selectivities,44−47 the effect of adding tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a cocatalyst
was studied, showing that selectivities could be improved up to 91%
toward the synthesis of the polyester (Table 1, entries 5–8). Entries 1–8
evidenced that bimetallic complexes 3–4 were more active for the ROCOP of CHO and SA than the monometallic
counterparts 1–2. On the other hand,
the catalytic activities of ethyl derivatives 2 and 4 are slightly higher than the methyl complexes 1 and 3 which have been previously observed for scorpionate
aluminum complexes.53,55,58 Finally, a reaction control using TBAB as a catalyst showed that
the cocatalyst by itself could catalyze the reaction but less efficiently.
NMR studies confirmed that the presence of TBAB is crucial in order
to increase the selectivity toward the synthesis of polyester (Figure 1). A stoichiometric
mixture of complex 4 and CHO in the absence of TBAB showed
that 47% of CHO is converted into polyether at the beginning of the
reaction at room temperature (Figure 1a). However, when a stoichiometric amount of TBAB is
added into the reaction mixture, no polyether was observed even after
4 h of reaction at 80 °C (Figure 1b).

Figure 1 (a) 1H NMR spectra of complex 4 and CHO
at t = 5 min and 25 °C in toluene-d8. (b) 1H NMR spectra of complex 4, TBAB, and CHO at t = 4 h and 80 °C in toluene-d8.

To optimize the catalytic system comprising complex 4, the influence of the cocatalyst for the ROCOP of CHO and
SA was
studied in the first instance (Figure 2 and Supporting Information). In general, the tetrabutylammonium salts displayed slightly higher
catalytic activity than their corresponding bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium
ones (PPNX), and TBAB showed to be the optimal cocatalyst for the
catalytic system in terms of activity and selectivity. Changing the
bromide counterion to a dinitrophenolate (DNP) counterion for PPNX
cocatalysts gave rise to an increase in activity and selectivity. N-Methylimidazole (NMI) and dimethylaminopryridine (DMAP)
were also investigated obtaining a good selectivity but a lower catalytic
activity than that obtained when using TBAB as a cocatalyst. The higher
catalytic activity when using a bromide counterion could be due to
the good balance between nucleophilicity and steric hindrance to ring
open the epoxide.

Figure 2 Influence of the cocatalyst on the catalytic activity
and selectivity
of complex 4 in the ROCOP of CHO and SA at 80 °C
in toluene for 16 h using 0.5 mol % of aluminum complex 4.

Because the best catalyst system
for the ROCOP of CHO and SA is
the combination of complex 4 and TBAB, we investigated
the solvent effect on the catalytic process (Table 2). We first studied the reaction in the absence
of a solvent to maximize the sustainability of the process but complete
conversion of the starting materials into the polyester was not achieved
because of solidification of the reaction mixture and the selectivity
toward the formation of polyester decreased down to 18% (Table 2, entry 1). The catalytic
system acted efficiently in a range of different solvents, but the
different polarities of the solvents did not significantly impact
on the selectivity of the process (Table 2, entries 2–5).

c The
reaction mixture was not homogeneous.

The versatility of the optimized catalyst system was
studied toward
the synthesis of a range of polyesters derived from the combination
of CHO and SA, PA, and maleic (MA) anhydrides (Chart 3). Moreover, the synthesis of biobased polyesters
derived from LO and SA, PA, and MA was also investigated (Chart 3).

Chart 3 Polyesters Derived
from CHO or LO and SA or PA or MA
Table 3 collects
the efficiency of the catalytic system toward the different substrates.
Good selectivities toward the synthesis of the corresponding polyester
were obtained in all cases. The experimental molecular weights obtained
for the polymers are lower than the theoretical values probably because
of the presence of transesterification reactions or chain transfer
reactions. These results might be justified by the presence of traces
of water or diacid from the hydrolysis of the corresponding cyclic
anhydride.46 It is worth noting that under
the same reaction conditions, when CHO was used as the substrate,
the conversions were higher (Table 3, entries 1–3) than those obtained for LO (Table 3, entries 7–9).
These results showed that the trisubstituted epoxide LO was a much
more challenging substrate for this reaction than a disubstituted
one. The effect of decreasing the [monomers]/[4] ratio
was also examined (Table 3, entries 3–6), showing that the molecular weight decreased
when the [monomers]/[4] ratio decreased from 200 to 50.

Copolymer Characterization
The obtained polymers were
characterized by NMR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC),
and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI-ToF). The formation of polyester materials was
confirmed by NMR analysis, showing that the ROCOP of epoxides and
anhydrides takes place in a controlled manner (Figure 3).

Figure 3 1H NMR spectrum (CDCl3, 25 °C) of poly(cyclohexene
succinate) obtained in Table 3, entry 1.

The resulting polymers
were analyzed by MALDI-ToF MS in order to
determine the end group. When a combination of complex 4 and TBAB was used as a catalyst system, the MALDI-ToF spectrum showed
multiple end-group series of peaks with an m/z interval of 198 mass units, indicating a controlled alternating
microstructure (Figure 4a).

Figure 4 MALDI-ToF spectra of poly(cyclohexene succinate) obtained using
a combination of complex 4 and TBAB (a) or a combination
of complex 4 and DMAP (b).

The major series (blue diamond) is in good agreement with
a polymer
chain with two hydroxyl end groups in the polyester, and the second
major series containing hydroxyl- and carboxylic acid end groups (red
diamond) was observed, indicating the existence of chain transfer
agents during the copolymerization.46,59 When DMAP
was used as a cocatalyst, the MALDI-ToF spectrum showed one end-group
series of peaks which corresponds to perfectly alternating poly(cyclohexene
succinate) chains with DMAP and an hydroxyl group as chain ends (Figure 4b).

Analysis
of the MALDI-ToF spectrum of the novel poly(limonene succinate)
revealed the existence of three series with an interval between the
consecutive peaks of 252 (Figure 5). These series correspond to chains with two hydroxy–limonene
end groups (blue diamond) and chains with hydroxyl and carboxylic
acid groups (red diamond). The presence of water or limonene-1,2-diol
in the reaction mixture could explain this observation.

combination of complex 4 and TBAB.

Thermal Properties of Copolymers
The thermal properties
of the obtained polyesters were analyzed by differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (see the Supporting Information). The glass-transition
temperatures (Tg’s) of the polyesters
prepared using the optimized catalytic system were determined by DSC,
and the results are listed in Table 4.

cycle.

As expected, in all
cases, the Tg values
for polymers derived from CHO (Table 4, entries 1–3) were higher than those obtained
when using LO (Table 4, entries 4–6). Similarly, when varying the cyclic anhydride,
the Tg increased on the order PA >
MA
> SA. These results suggest an increase of the Tg values with the rigidity of the monomer.60 TGA revealed that all polymers are stable in
the range
of temperatures from 10 to 200 °C except for LO/MA for which
the range of temperatures was from 10 to 125 °C (see the Supporting Information).

Kinetic Studies on the
Synthesis of Poly(cyclohexene phthalate)
Catalyzed by Complex 4 and TBAB
In order to
gain insight into the polymerization process catalyzed by complex 4 and TBAB, a kinetic study for the synthesis of poly(cyclohexene
phthalate) was performed in toluene at 80 °C. Samples were taken
from the polymerization reaction every hour and analyzed by NMR to
determine the conversion of the starting materials into the corresponding
polyester and the selectivity of the process. Experiments carried
out under these reaction conditions showed a good fit to first-order
kinetics.

First, the order with respect to the concentration
of complex 4 was investigated by carrying out reactions
using [4] = 0.1–0.75 mol % whilst keeping constant
[TBAB] = 0.5 mol %. Similarly, the order with respect to the concentration
of TBAB was determined by carrying out reactions using [TBAB] = 0.25–1.0
mol % whilst keeping constant [4] = 0.25 mol %. The plots
log[4] versus log(k1avg)
and log[TBAB] versus log(k1avg) showed
a good fit to a straight line with slopes of 0.84 and 1.12, respectively
(Figures 6 and 7), suggesting that the reactions are first order
with respect to the concentration of complex 4 and TBAB.
This was confirmed by plotting [4] versus k1avg and [TBAB] versus k1avg, which also fitted to a straight line (Figures 8 and 9).

CHO and PA.

the ROCOP of CHO and PA.

Figure 8 Plot of k1obs vs [4] for
the ROCOP of CHO and PA.

Figure 9 Plot of k1obs vs [TBAB] for the ROCOP
of CHO and PA.

Finally, a plausible
mechanism for the ROCOP catalyzed by a combination
of complex 4 and TBAB is proposed in Scheme 4. A first step is expected
for the activation of CHO by one aluminum center of complex 4 to give rise to the intermediate 4a followed
by nucleophilic attack of the cocatalyst to form an alkoxide derivative 4b. This alkoxide intermediate might ring open an activated
monomer of PA by the second aluminum center to yield a carboxylate
species 4c which can undergo successive alternating ring-opening
reactions of epoxides and anhydrides to form the desired polyester
materials.

Scheme 4 Proposed Mechanism for the ROCOP Catalyzed by Complex 4 and a Nucleophile Cocatalyst
Conclusions
The identification of catalytic systems
capable of promoting ROCOP
of epoxides and cyclic anhydrides in a controlled manner is a field
needed to be developed. Even though this catalytic reaction could
give rise to a plethora of new biodegradable macrostructures, there
are still drawbacks to be overcome, such as the low molecular weight
of the obtained polymers or the modest selectivity of the catalysts.
To improve efficiency in selectivity for the ROCOP, in this work,
we present an optimized catalytic system based on organoaluminum entities.
The catalytic system comprising complex 4 as a catalyst,
TBAB as a cocatalyst, toluene as a solvent, CHO and PA or SA as substrates,
and a temperature of 80 °C can carry out the reactions to give
rise to copolymers CHO/PA and CHO/SA with 100% of conversion and up
to 90% of selectivity. Although the molecular weights of the copolymers
obtained are low ranging from 1200 to 3600 g/mol, those copolymers
could be used for a range of applications such as coatings and resins.31

The kinetics of the reaction are first
order with respect to the
concentration of complex 4 and TBAB. It is worth noting
that amongst the copolymers obtained, the poly(limonene succinate)
is reported for the first time. Finally, a mechanism for the catalytic
reaction is also proposed along the article.

Experimental Part
General Procedures
and Techniques
All manipulations
of air- and water-sensitive compounds were carried out under dry nitrogen
using Braun Labmaster glovebox or standard Schlenk line techniques.
NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Ascend TM-500/400 spectrometers
and referenced to the residual deuterated solvent. TGA of the products
was performed on a TGA instrument (model TGA-Q50). The heating rate
for the sample was 10 °C/min, and the nitrogen flow rate was
60 mL/min. DSC curves were obtained under N2 atmosphere
on a TA Instrument (model DSC-Q20). Samples were weighed into aluminum
crucibles with 5 mg of sample and subjected to two heating cycles
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. GPC measurements were performed
on a Polymer Laboratories PL-GPC-220 instrument equipped with a TSK-GEL
G3000H column and an ELSD-LTII light scattering detector or/and a
RID-20A differential refractive index detector. The GPC column was
eluted with tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 50 °C at a flow rate of
1 mL/min and was calibrated using eight monodisperse polystyrene standards
in the range 580–48 300 Da.

Materials and Reagents
The synthesis of aluminum complexes
was performed as previously reported.58,61,62 Solvents were predried over a sodium wire (toluene, n-hexane, THF) and distilled under nitrogen from sodium
(toluene, THF) or sodium–potassium alloy (n-hexane). Deuterated solvents were stored over activated 4 Å
molecular sieves and degassed by several freeze thaw cycles. CHO and
LO (Sigma-Aldrich) were predried over calcium hydride, distilled under
vacuum, and stored under nitrogen in a glovebox. PA (Sigma-Aldrich)
was kept in a glovebox and used as received. SA and MA (Sigma-Aldrich)
were sublimed three times and stored under nitrogen in the glovebox.
All other reagents were purchased from common commercial sources and
used as received.

Representative Copolymerization Procedure
In the glovebox,
complex 4 (20 μmol), cocatalyst (20 μmol),
and a cyclic anhydride (4 mmol) were placed into a 10 mL Schlenk equipped
with a small stir bar. Toluene (2 mL) was added, and the reaction
mixture was stirred. Then, the epoxide (4 mmol) was added and the
reaction mixture was placed in a preheated oil bath at the desired
temperature. After the appropriate time, a small aliquot was taken
from the reaction mixture for NMR analysis to determine the monomer
conversion and process selectivity. The viscous mixture was then dissolved
in a minimum amount of dichloromethane or toluene and precipitated
into an excess of MeOH or pentane. The polymer was then dried and
collected as a white or light-yellow solid typically in 80–85%
yield.

Representative Kinetic Procedure
In the glovebox, complex 4 (2–15 mM), TBAB (5–20 mM), and PA (4 mmol)
were placed in a 10 mL vial equipped with a small stir bar. Toluene
(2 mL) was added, followed by the addition of CHO (4 mmol). The vials
were placed in a preheated multireactor at the desired temperature.
Small aliquots were taken for NMR analysis to determine monomer conversions
and reaction selectivities at the desired times.
