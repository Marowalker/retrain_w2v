Previous
theoretical reports have described the oxidation of few-layer
black phosphorus and its effects on the electronic properties. Theoretically,
native oxide layers bring opportunities for band gap engineering,
but the detection of the different types of oxides is still a challenge
at the experimental level. In this work, we uncover a correlation
between thermal processes and Raman shift for the Ag1, B2g, and Ag2 vibrational modes.
The thermal expansion coefficients (temperature range, 290–485
K) for the Ag1, B2g, and Ag2 were −0.015, −0.027, and −0.028 cm–1 K–1, respectively. Differential
scanning calorimetry analysis shows an endothermic process centered
at 528 K, and it was related with a mass increase according to thermogravimetric
analysis. Raman shift temperature dependence was correlated to theoretical
lattice thermal expansion, and a significant deviation was detected
in the stacking direction at 500 K.

1 Introduction
Exfoliated
black phosphorus (BP) is an anisotropic p-type semiconductor1,2 with interesting properties: hole mobility between 100 and 1000
cm2 V–1 s–1,3 on/off ratio at room temperature between 102 and 105,2 and tunable
direct band gap between 0.3 eV in the bulk phase and 2.2 eV for the
monolayer.4,5 The band gap modulation of black phosphorus
ranges between the defect-induced band gaps of graphene (0 to ∼0.3
eV3) and the typical values for transition-metal dichalcogenides;3,6,7 therefore, during the past years,
BP has been recognized as a promising material for electronic and
optoelectronic devices.8

Black phosphorus
offers several opportunities for applications:
water splitting,9 nanoresonators,10 and gas sensing11 are some examples. Nevertheless, prompt oxidation, in comparison
to other 2D materials,12−17 is among its biggest challenges. Oxidation in BP may cause dramatic
structural transformations,5,18−20 but controlled oxidation can be useful to engineer its electronic
properties,7,13,21 increase its environmental stability by passivation,5,20,22,23 or ease its reaction with certain molecules.18,24

The chemisorption of oxygen dimers (O2) over BP
can
be affected by visible light, as the potential barriers decrease from
larger than 10 eV in pristine surfaces to less than 6 eV at intrinsic
defect sites.25,26 Experimentally, the effect of
light on oxidation has been proven, and samples stored in the dark
show lower rates of degradation.27 Edmonds
et al., working on air-oxidized bulk BP crystal, demonstrated the
presence of several types of oxides20 in
agreement with theoretical studies.5 Nevertheless,
phosphorus pentoxide (i.e., O′–(P2O5)∞) is considered to be the
most stable form of oxide.5,28

Light, water,
and oxygen are the environmental factors required
for oxidation of black phosphorus according to theoretical18,25 and experimental23,27,29,30 studies. Favron et al. proved that independently,
neither visible light in a vacuum (5 × 10–6 torr) nor oxygen and water can induce any degradation on black phosphorus
detectable by conventional Raman spectroscopy (2 × 104 W cm–2 at λ = 532 nm).27 Similarly, Woomer et al. confirmed the role of light (λ
= 460 nm) in the oxidation process by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements and oxygen (not dried) exposure. The oxidation
was evident from the broadening of the peak at 133 eV.29

The oxidation of black phosphorus modifies
the electronic properties
of the material, but the degree of modification depends on the type
of the formed oxide. Different kinds of modifications are expected:
lattice parameter variations;5,25,28,31 vibrational energy variations
due to the presence of oxygen bound in dangling or bridging configurations;18 and electronic property variations,20 depending on the type of oxide, degree of oxidation,2 and local geometry.25

Theoretical studies5,18,22,32 predicted the formation of oxygen
bonding
in dangling, bridging, and interstitial configurations (Figure 1). Dangling and interstitial
oxygen bonds are electrically neutral, but the bridging configurations
create levels in the gap.18,21 Interstitial oxygen
is characterized by higher lattice distortions,18 and dangling oxygen configuration is energetically favored
for lower oxygen concentrations.5,18 However, the Coulomb
repulsion between oxygen p orbitals is higher for the dangling type
of oxides;5 therefore, the orientation
of the P=O bonds always points away in different directions
from the zigzag ridge, in which they are chemisorbed.5,18,25

Figure 1 Oxidized black phosphorus forms. Pristine
monolayer (a), surface
dangling oxygen (red)—BP oxide (b), and interstitial and dangling
oxygen configurations (c).

The band gap engineering of phosphorene has been proposed
by different
methods: modification of the external conditions (i.e., electric bias,
mechanical strain),9 functionalization,32 heterostructures,2 passivation,16,20,27,32,33 oxidation,5,7,21,22,34 and changes in local geometry7,25 are some examples. For instance, BP-controlled oxidation or passivation
with h-BN can induce higher hole or electron mobilities, respectively,2 and oxidation or doping with H2 and
F2 changes the band gap from direct to indirect.5,21,32 In general, some similarities
have been pointed out for highly oxidized forms (t-P4O10 and p-P4O10): the valence and conduction bands always come from the
oxygen p orbitals (e.g., in dangling and bridging configurations),5 the higher occupied levels are degenerate dispersionless
states, and the conduction bands are slightly dispersive.5 These features are of importance as the tuning
of the band gap increases the stability of the material25 and the feasibility for applications.9,23 Theoretically, differences have been pointed out in comparison between
interstitial (planar) and surface oxides: the average binding energy
(Eb) of the material depends on the number
of oxygens in the unit cell, but the Eb of the surface oxide is lower than that of the interstitial (planar)
counterpart by approximately 0.7 eV.5

In phosphorene band gap engineering, “the issue
seems to be how oxidation is detected”, as stated
by Ziletti et al.18 Conventional Raman
spectroscopy has been useful for different purposes in the research
of black phosphorus: exfoliation,4,16,35,36 alkali intercalation,37 annealing,38 photo-oxidation,27 and functionalization/passivation39,40 are some examples. However, the theoretically predicted variety
of oxidized species has not been detected by Raman spectroscopy yet.
The present work demonstrates a correlation between theoretical studies,
thermal analysis, and conventional backscattering Raman spectroscopy
and contributes to the understanding of the oxidation process in black
phosphorus.

2 Results and Discussion
The suspensions
produced through liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE)
were characterized by DLS, and the results are shown in Table 1. All of the samples were stable
with apparent zeta potentials larger than 30 mV. The average hydrodynamic
size was controlled by increasing centrifugation speeds, as described
in the Methods section. Previous results demonstrate that acetone
can be used for the exfoliation of black phosphorus with good reproducibility
of the basic features (size, thickness, and stability). The produced
material is easier to handle and clean than that obtained with other
solvents such as NMP or CHP. In our previous work,41 we have shown the topographical characteristics of the
flakes produced with LPE in acetone. The correlation between atomic
force microscopy (AFM) measurements and hydrodynamic sizes constitute
an operational advantage at the moment of characterizing the material
because DLS is considerably faster than atomic force microscopy.

The optical band
gaps of the exfoliated materials are shown in Table 1. The close match
between the optical band gap of the sample BP4S and the theoretical
electronic band gap of the monolayer (Eg: 2.2 eV4,42) is explained by the relationship between
the exciton binding energy and the dielectric constant of the medium.29 For exfoliated black phosphorus in acetone (dielectric
constant, ε = 20.7), the exciton binding energy is expected
to be −31.1 meV.29 From these results,
we conclude that our suspensions are mixtures of monolayers, bilayers,
and trilayers and that their composition varies toward the isolated
monolayers with increasing rotational frequency during centrifugation.41 This is an important characteristic of the sample
as the collected Raman spectra have less or no interference from inner
flakes in the crystalline structure.

2.1 Thermal
Analysis of Bulk Black Phosphorus
Oxidation
Thermogravimetric curves for bulk BP in oxidative
media (synthetic air) are presented in Figure 2. The onset temperature of the mass increase
was 630 K (Figure 2a). Additionally, two samples were tested at different heating ramps:
5 K min–1 (Figure 2a,b) and 10 K min–1 (not shown).
The weight derivatives show a starting point for the mass increase
at approximately 493 K (Figure 2b). The sample decomposition, measured as a mass decrease,
was predominant at approximately 703 K (Figure 2a). The first derivative peaks were located
at approximately 683 and 753 K, and they indicate the temperatures
of the greatest rate of mass increase and decrease, respectively (Figure 2a). These results
are in agreement with those obtained by Liu et al., using in situ
scanning/transmission electron microscopy, as the selective area electron
diffraction patterns for exfoliated black phosphorus, but with thicknesses
between 10 and 40 nm, show decomposition, which starts at approximately
673 K.43

BP in oxidative media

extrapolation before and after the inflection point (a). Details of

scanning calorimetry from the bulk starting material (black) and the
peak fitting output (green) (nitrogen media, heating ramp: 5 K min–1; aluminum pan and lid) (c).

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were
done
with aluminum sample holders (pan + lid) in a controlled nitrogen
atmosphere. Two different processes were detected during the heating
cycle (Figure 2c):
one endothermic process centered at approximately 528 K and one exothermic
peak centered at approximately 643 K. The measured endothermic process
was broad (full width at half-maximum (FWHM): 101 K) and started at
approximately 423 K. The exothermic peak was 10 times sharper (FWHM:
100 K), had low intensity (approximately 5.2 mW g–1), and was detectable at almost the same temperature with the maximum
rate of oxygen uptake, as seen from the TGA measurements in oxidative
media (Figure 2a,b).
In the literature, two processes were found to be exothermic: (1)
the oxygen chemisorption on black phosphorus18,24,25,32,34 and (2) the formation of interstitial oxygen bridges.18 We suppose that the exothermic peak relates
with oxygen chemisorption as it was available for the sample before
it was closed in the holder of the DSC measurement. The cooling cycle
was exothermic (not shown) and can be interpreted as reversibility
of the broad endothermic peak shown in Figure 2c.

The nature of the endothermic process
is uncertain, but the melting-crystallization
process is unlikely since the melting temperatures of black and red
phosphorus are 873 and 893 K, respectively.44 Liu et al. reported a thermal-induced increase of the lattice parameters
of exfoliated black phosphorus43 in the
same temperature range as our DSC measurements. On the other hand,
Ziletti et al., based on theoretical calculations, reported that the
binding energies of interstitial and dangling oxides are −1.66
and −2.08 eV at PBE level, respectively,18 and transformation from dangling to interstitial oxygen
requires 0.69 eV via oxygen penetration into the lattice.

On
the basis of these evidences, we suggest that the endothermic
process is caused by the lattice thermal expansion43 and subsequent formation of interstitial oxygen bonding
as larger and weaker P–P bonds favor interstitial oxygen formation.
In a second step, the new configuration reduces the Coulomb repulsion5 and allows higher oxygen incorporation as seen
in the TGA (Figure 2), giving place to the calculated planar type of oxides (Figure 1c). Summarizing,
we propose that the transitions visible in the thermal analysis evidence
transformations from surface to interstitial type of oxides, possibly
at intrinsic defects since the thermal energy involved is not enough
to induce the transition in defect-free surfaces. The consequences
of this suggestion are confirmation of the higher stability of surface
(dangling or bridging) over the interstitial type of oxides and supporting
the understanding of the following results with Raman spectroscopy.

2.2 Few-Layer Black Phosphorus Oxidation
The
typical Raman spectrum for the bulk starting material is shown
in Figure 3a. The following
results were obtained from measurements with a backscattering configuration.
According to calculated phonon dispersion curves, the Ag1, B2g, and Ag2 vibrational
modes are visible in the first Brillouin zone and oscillate along
the z, y, and x directions, respectively.7,17 Ziletti et al., in
theoretical studies,5,18 described vibrational modes at
1099 cm–1 for dangling oxygen, 574 and 763 cm–1 for interstitial oxygen, and no vibrational modes
between 500 and 1000 cm–1 for surface oxides. However,
for surface oxides, they predicted a blue shift in the P=O
stretching mode region (1063 cm–1) with increasing
oxygen concentration until reaching approximately 1370 cm–1,5 but these modes have not been detected
with conventional Raman spectroscopy.

Figure 3 Raman characterization for the bulk starting
material and the representation
of the visible vibrational modes (a). Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image of the few-layer black phosphorus (AsEx) (b). The scale
bar is 500 nm.

Raman spectroscopy has
been used to evaluate exfoliation processes
by measuring blue shift in the position of the vibrational modes,
but its applicability in that purpose is still not fully accepted.7,27 Lower intensities in the Raman shift spectra, lower Ag1/Ag2 intensity ratios,
and the emergence of broad features between the B2g and
Ag2 vibrational
modes have been identified as signatures of oxidation.16,17,27 On the other hand, the blue shift
in the Raman spectra of black phosphorus has been related with thermal
annealing processes of exfoliated materials (thickness: approximately
15 nm)38 and degradation of thick samples
(thickness >35 nm).45

The TEM
image presented in Figure 3b shows a good agreement with the DLS (Table 1) and previous AFM measurements.41 The study of disordered graphene has been recognized
as a strong necessity for practical progress.46 In this work, we evaluate the oxidation of polycrystalline samples
of few-layer phosphorene. This sample preparation allows larger-area
coverage for easier scalability.

Previously, the correlation
between oxygen content and electronic
properties has been discussed.5,13 In addition to the
prediction of electrically neutral oxides,18 Malyi et al. stated that oxygen-poor compounds can be considered
as “black phosphorene” modified by oxygen adsorption.13 The coexistence of the different types of oxides
is expected as their energies are degenerate in relation to the full
oxidized forms (P2O5).5,18,34 Edmonds et al. detected bridging and dangling
oxygens on the surface of air-oxidized bulk black phosphorus.20 In agreement with theoretical studies, the electronic
properties of black phosphorus were altered by oxidation: the workfunction
had small variations of only 0.1 eV in comparison to pristine bulk
black phosphorus, but the electronic band gap had a large modulation
(>4.5 eV). From the photoelectron spectroscopy measurements,20,23 the presence of bridging, dangling, and P2O5 was related to peaks centered at 131.54, 132.67, and 134.46 eV,
respectively.

Our XPS measurements on acetone-exfoliated black
phosphorus (AsEx)
coated on a silicon wafer are shown in Figure 4. After 21 days of air oxidation (Figure 4b), a slight broadening
of the peak at 133.5 eV was measured (i.e., FWHM: 1.8 and 2.4 eV for
the sample at starting time and 21 days later, respectively) in agreement
with the previous reports.29 Edmonds et
al. with synchrotron-based photoelectron spectroscopy reported the
appearance of two peaks at 131.5 and 132.7 eV related with bridging
and dangling oxygen bonding, respectively.20 In our measurements, we detected a broad peak in the same region
(132.4 eV), but diminished with the increasing intensity of the peak
corresponding to phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5)
at 133.5 eV.

(AsEx).

region at 133.5 eV for the sample at the starting point (blue) and

The exfoliated flakes were analyzed by TEM (Figure S3) to evaluate the crystal structure after controlled
oxygen exposition. From the electron diffractions, no major modifications
were detected in the zigzag and armchair directions in agreement with
our previous studies.41 X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns were collected after cycles of oxygen exposition at
523 K (Figure S4), but no modifications
in the stacking direction were detected. The lattice constants calculated
for the exfoliated materials are a: 3.3 Å, b: 4.3 Å, and c: 10.8 Å, even
after the oxygen exposition, suggesting that the surface oxide is
the predominant form and showing the reversibility (Figures S4 and S5) of the process as indicated by DSC results.
Altogether, these results confirm the presence of the surface type
of oxides.

In the dangling configuration, the oxygen atoms bond
to the surface
at the zigzag ridge (Figure 1) and the P–O bonds in the dangling position form an
angle of 44.5° from the surface.10,18,24 Herein, the differences in electronegativity between
P and O atoms polarize the surface18 with
different implications9 (i.e., “water
bubbles” formation25). We suggest
that the geometry of surface oxides and their polarization effect
explain the blue shift detected in some of the samples under evaluation
(Figures S1 and S2). Interestingly, monotonic
blue shift for the P=O stretching mode has been proposed for
the detection of dangling oxygens;5 however,
it has not been reported in the literature with conventional Raman
spectroscopy.

The Raman shift temperature dependence (temperature
range: 98.15–673.15
K) was evaluated for a drop-cast sample (i.e., BP4S acetone) mounted
on a temperature-controlled probe stage (HFS600E, Linkam). The stage
was fed with argon at a rate of 200 mL min–1. The
spectra were fitted with Lorentzian functions, and the center of the
peaks was tabulated against the corresponding temperature. In Figure 5, reciprocal Raman
shift was plotted against temperature (blue squares) and overlaid
on the thermal expansion of the lattice constants, as calculated by
Villegas et al.47 (black). For temperatures
lower than 500 K (220 °C), Ag1, B2g, and Ag2 vibrational modes exhibit good
agreement with the lattice constants in the stacking, zigzag, and
armchair directions. These results agree with previous reports with
a 4 nm thick layer.48 More interestingly, Figures 5a and 2b–c show an endothermic process starting at approximately
493 K (220 °C) and in situ Raman spectroscopy localized this
process in the stacking direction (Ag1 vibrational mode), in agreement with our proposed
model for the thermal analysis, but this effect was not visible in
thicker layers48 possibly because the oxidation
happens only at the topmost layer20 and
measurements with thicker samples hinder the effect on the Raman spectra.
As expected, the dangling to interstitial transition requires an additional
expansion in the stacking direction to place oxygen atoms in between
two phosphorus atoms in the stacking direction, and this endothermic
process can be followed by in situ Raman spectroscopy and DSC.

black arrow indicates a temperature of 500 K (a), zigzag direction

During the Raman spectra measurements,
four spectra were consecutively
collected at each temperature to analyze the laser effect. The standard
deviation for the peak position during consecutive samples (time between
consecutive samples: <30 s) is negligible (standard deviation <0.5
cm–1 for temperatures lower than 500 K) in comparison
to the thermal effect controlled by the stage. Even though local heating
is produced during laser exposure, no laser-induced chemical modifications
were detected during the Raman measurement according to the standard
deviations (Figure S6 in the Supporting
Information).

The thermal expansion coefficients and phonon
frequencies at 0
K shown in Table 2 were
calculated from the linear fit parameters of the Raman shift temperature
dependence (Figure 5), according to the Grüneisen model in eq 1. These results are in good agreement with
previous reports49,50 for evaluations in the temperature
range of 293–433 K. 1  The correlation between the lattice expansion
and the Raman shift shown in Figure 5 can be described by the following mathematical model,
where [ω0 + χT] corresponds
to the Grüneisen model parameters corresponding to each vibrational
mode, and a, b, and c are the lattice constants      Herein,
we propose the previous mathematical
model as a baseline to evaluate the modifications of the lattice caused
by processes like oxidation or interstitial intercalation/doping in
the temperature range of 200–450 K for few-layer systems. The R-square coefficients for the three equations were 0.995,
0.9996, and 0.9995 for the lattice constants a, b, and c, respectively.

Ziletti et al. calculated
the band gap dependence on the number
of oxygen atoms per unit cell. For surface oxides, the calculated
band gap was approximately 2.5 eV for two or four oxygen atoms per
unit cell; however, for the planar form (i.e., in the presence of
interstitial oxygen), the calculated band gap exhibited a monotonic
increase with the number of oxygen atoms per unit cell (Table 3). Therefore, controlling the
type of oxide and the number of oxygen atoms in the unit cell enables
opportunities for the band gap engineering in black phosphorus.5

Experimentally, water bubbles formation at the surface
of exfoliated
BP has been used as an indicator of oxidation.24 Here, a quantitative tool for tracking the oxidation of
black phosphorus and few-layer BP by backscattering Raman is shown.
We have described a proposed model based on the evidence from thermal
analysis (TGA, DSC), Raman spectroscopy, in situ TEM, XRD, photoelectron
spectroscopy, and theoretical studies as a contribution on the required
understanding of black phosphorus oxidation.

3 Conclusions
Different types of oxides coexist in air-oxidized
bulk black phosphorus.20,23 Theoretical studies provide insightful
results: fully oxidized compounds
and intermediate states have close binding energy values.5 Herein, our samples contain several kinds of
oxides, and oxygen-poor forms are present even after 28 days of air
exposition.20 Theoretically, the oxygen
adsorption is an exothermic process and the dangling position is 0.69
eV18 more energetically favorable than
the bridging and interstitial positions. The first stages of oxidation
are characterized by slight or no alteration of the Raman spectra,
while the Raman shift temperature dependence reveals a process in
the stacking direction occurring at 493 K. This result was congruent
with our reported thermogravimetric analysis.

In situ Raman
spectroscopy shows a good fitting between the lattice
constants and theoretical thermal expansion of the unit cell and validates
previous theoretical calculations on black phosphorus oxidation. This
work unlocks opportunities for applications of band gap engineering
with black phosphorus native oxides. We propose a simple mathematical
model to track deformations in the lattice structure by using the
Grüneisen and the fitting between Raman and lattice temperature
dependence.

From the thermal analysis, we report the decomposition
of bulk
black phosphorus (sublimation43) at approximately
703 K in oxidative media. Additionally, we report an inflection point
at approximately 493 K, where the oxygen uptake is exponentially observed
and might be considered as an operational restriction limit for the
usage of black phosphorus in certain applications. Transitions were
visible in DSC measurements at approximately 528 K for heating ramps
of 5 K min–1, and we relate them to surface (dangling,
bridging) to interstitial oxygen-bonding transformations, as seen
by in situ Raman spectroscopy.

4 Methods
4.1 Few-Layer
Black Phosphorus Preparation
Bulk black phosphorus crystal
was purchased from HQ Graphene (Groningen,
The Netherlands) and stored in the dark and argon atmosphere. The
exfoliation method was ultrasonication in a 120 W, 35 kHz bath. Bulk
BP crystals (5 mg) were added to 13 mL of acetone in a glass vial
tightly closed with a septum cap. The mixture was bubbled with argon
to drive out the dissolved oxygen from the solvent and the free space
inside the vial. The temperature during the sonication was kept constant
at 298 K, and the sonication time was fixed to 24 h. After the ultrasonication
period, the sample was allowed to sediment for 24 h, after which the
supernatant was collected and marked as AsEx. This sample was flushed
with argon and stored for additional characterization. Another fraction
was collected from the sample AsEx and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for
30 min. The supernatant was collected, flushed, and labeled as BP2S.
From the sample BP2S, another fraction was collected and centrifuged
at 4000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was collected, flushed, and
labeled as BP4S.

4.2 Few-Layer Black Phosphorus
Characterization
Raman characterization was performed at
the excitation wavelength
of 532 nm and a nominal laser power of 12.5 mW (Senterra, Bruker).
The sample was drop-cast on either glass microscope slides or silicon
wafers as the substrate. The samples were characterized using a well-defined
optical objective (Olympus) to ensure that the scanning area, laser
power, and wavelength were the same for all samples. The spectral
resolution was set to ca. 3–5 cm–1, and the
interferometer resolution was 1.5 cm–1. All of the
spectra were collected using three coadditions of 5 s each and taken
at random locations on the few-layer BP clusters over time.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TA Instruments, Q500, TGA) was conducted
using a platinum sample holder in oxidative atmosphere (synthetic
air) at a heating ramp of 5 K min–1. Differential
scanning calorimetry (TA Instruments, Q20, DSC) was carried out using
an aluminum sample holder (pan + lid) in nitrogen atmosphere at a
heating ramp of 5 K min–1. The baseline was taken
with empty sample holders (pan + lid) for the DSC measurements.

The absorption spectra in the UV–vis–NIR region were
measured in a spectrophotometer (Hitachi, U-2001) with a sweep speed
of 100 nm min–1. The scanning window was set between
300 and 1100 nm. The samples were placed in a quartz high-precision
cell with a light path of 10 mm (Hellma Analytics).

The hydrodynamic
size and zeta potentials of the suspensions were
measured by dispersed light scattering (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern)
at a wavelength of 633 nm. The refractive index utilized for the few-layer
BP was 3.4.51,52 For acetone, the refractive index
and the dynamic viscosity values at room temperature were 1.356 and
0.3111 mPa s, respectively.
