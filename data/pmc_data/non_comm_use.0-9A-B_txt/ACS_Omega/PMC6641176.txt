The
assembly of integral membrane proteins depends on the packing
of hydrophobic interfaces. The forces driving this packing remain
unclear. In this study, we have investigated the effect of mutations
in these hydrophobic interfaces on the structure and function of the
tetrameric Escherichia coli water channel
aquaporin Z (AqpZ). Among the variants, we have constructed several
fail to form tetramers and are monomeric. In particular, both of the
mutants which are expected to create interfacial cavities become monomeric.
Furthermore, one of the mutations can be compensated by a second-site
mutation. We suggest that the constraints imposed by the nature of
the lipid solvent result in interfaces that respond differently to
modifications of residues. Specifically, the large size and complex
conformations of lipid molecules are unable to fill small interfacial
holes. Further, we observe in AqpZ that there is a link between the
oligomeric state and the water channel activity. This despite the
robustness of both protein folding and topology, both of which remain
unchanged by the mutations we introduce. We propose that this linkage
may result from the specific modes of structural flexibility in the
monomeric protein.

1 Introduction
Aquaporins
(AQPs) are transmembrane channels that facilitate the
passive entry of water into cells,1 a crucial
mechanism in homeostasis and regulation. Discovered in the 90s, AQPs
are today one of the best structurally characterized membrane protein
superfamilies. AQP protomers are formed by six transmembrane spanning
helices, with cytoplasmic N and C termini,2 surrounding the permeation water pore. In biological membranes,
they assemble into remarkably stable homotetramers3,4 that
make the minimal functional unit. In this structure, each of the four
monomers appears to provide independent water channels.5

Even when several different AQPs are co-expressed
in the same cell,
they do not form mixed tetramers in mammalian cells.6,7 However, mixed tetramers containing two isoforms of the plant AQP,
PIP1 and PIP2, have been reported.8

The problem of protein assembly in membranes is very general as
many membrane proteins contain multiple subunits.9 For example, cytochrome c oxidase is composed
of 13 different polypeptide subunits, of which 10 are integral membrane
proteins containing a total of 54 closely packed transmembrane helices.10 Many membrane proteins also form less stable
“supercomplexes” with an important functional role,
as seen in the mitochondrial electron transport chains.11 Other examples include more transient higher
order functional assemblies such as signaling platforms where multiple
receptors assemble both in bacteria12 and
in eukaryotes.13

While in membranes
AQPs form tetramers, in vitro solubilized and
isolated AQP tetramers show different oligomerization behaviors in
detergents. Water-selective AQPs usually remain tetrameric in mild
detergents, for example, Escherichia coli aquaporin Z (AqpZ) in dodecyl maltoside. By contrast, glycerol channels,
such as E. coli GlpF, are often isolated
as monomers.14 Mechanisms driving the efficient,
specific, and stable assembly of monomers into tetramers should exist,
but to date no model has clearly identified the structural features
responsible for the assembly of specific stable oligomers.

As
has been previously remarked,15 the
easily obtainable E. coli water channels
are a valuable working model to define the structural characteristics
of AQP superfamily. AqpZ is made up of 63.8% hydrophobic amino acids,16 and the tetrameric structure has a large hydrophobic
interface within the membrane thickness. The formation of oligomers
is the result of protein–protein interactions, being favored
over protein–environment interactions. GlpF was already used
as a model to study the effect of the V71M mutation on
the tetramerization of human Aqp2, a mutation that leads to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.17 Some mutations have previously been shown to disrupt the tetrameric
structure. In GlpF, substitution of the glutamate E43,
close to the central axis between monomers, results in monomers with
reduced activity, less than ∼30%.18 A similar study of human Aqp4 showed a reduction in tetramerization
when an intracellular loop was mutated.19 Hydrophobic interactions between monomers are not directly impacted
by those mutations.

To date, there is little information available
on the importance
of intramembrane interactions on the stability of membrane proteins.
In the context of individual transmembrane helices, building on the
model of glycophorin a,20 several factors have been highlighted including interactions between
GxxxG motifs,21,22 burial of less hydrophobic surfaces,23,24 and polar clamps.25 Only recently has
this work been extended to more extensive interfaces among the membrane
proteins. Perhaps most importantly with the ClC protein from Escherichia coli,26,27 it has been
demonstrated that tryptophan residues can severely disrupt dimer formation.27

In the work reported here, we have modified
the hydrophobic surfaces
within the lipid bilayer by mutating key interfacial residues, resulting
in the destabilization of AqpZ tetramers. We characterize these AqpZ
mutants in terms of structure, assembly, and function.

2 Results
AqpZ is a hydrophobic membrane-embedded protein
that forms a very
stable tetrameric structure,28,29 with considerable buried
surface area. On the basis of the amino acid sequence, ProtParam16 calculates a GRAVY index, a measure of hydrophobicity
running from −4.5 for arginine to 4.5 for isoleucine, of 0.934
for the protein. The formation of the tetramer results in the burial
of a large surface area that is calculated to be about 7000 Å2 by PDBePISA.30 This represents
a quarter of the protein surface area.

One known structural
pattern for the stabilization of hydrophobic
interfaces is a surface complementarity. In such a knobs into holes
interface protrusion of amino acid side chains from one monomer into
holes in the companion gives a complementary tight packing,31,32 much like the pieces of a puzzle. This arrangement prevents the
destabilizing effects of cavities or solvent infiltration into the
interface.

To destabilize the tetramer, we, therefore, examined
the interface
looking for target sites where knobs from one monomer were embedded
in holes in the partner. On the basis of our observations, we targeted
two sites in the center of the interface, which are highlighted in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Structure of AqpZ tetramer
and location of mutations. The crystallographic
structure PDB id: 1RC2(34) was used to prepare these figures using
PyMOL.33 (A) View of the structure highlighting
the interface. One monomer is shown as the Cα chain, dark blue
lines, and the surfaces of the two neighboring monomers, light blue
and white, are shown to highlight the roughness of the interfaces.
The residues modified in this study are shown as spheres. The bulky
side chains of W14 and I176 fit into holes at
the interface bordered by G144 and A42, respectively.
(B) Close-up of the interface between two monomers (dark blue and
turquoise), illustrating the modifications. Small residues are shown
in lines, and bulky residues are shown as sticks. The native residues
(W14, A42, G144, and I176) are shown in violet color, and the mutated residues are shown in
red color (A14, F42, F144, and G176).

At the first site, a
knob on the first transmembrane helix formed
by the residue W14 is located in a hole between the fourth
and fifth transmembrane helices; one of the residues lining this hole
is G144. To disrupt this interface, we constructed the
mutants W14A and G144F that are expected to
remove the knob and fill the hole, respectively, as can be readily
appreciated for the steric clash illustrated in Figure 1B. We also constructed the double mutant
W14A–G144F, hoping for some compensation
between the two single mutations. The compensatory mutant chosen was
with a phenylalanine rather than with a tryptophan as this appeared
to be more easily accommodated when the structures were examined with
PyMOL.33

At the second site, the
knob was formed by the residue I176 on helix 5, and this
was inserted in a groove between helices 1
and 2. One of the residues bordering this groove is A42. To target this site, we again constructed three mutants A42F, I176G, and the double mutant A42F–I176G. This set of mutations was again evaluated using PyMOL.33

As a starting point for our study, we
decided to use the previously
studied AqpZ-C20S mutant.4 This
protein is known to have a slightly destabilized tetrameric structure,
and the presence of a single cysteine residue would facilitate experiments
requiring labeling with maleimides.

Membrane protein topology
and the orientation and location of transmembrane
helices can be sensitive both to changes in protein sequence35,36 and to alterations in membrane composition.37 We, therefore, verified that the mutations we introduced did not
modify the membrane insertion of AqpZ, Figure 2.

Figure 2 Effect of mutations on membrane insertion. (Top)
Cartoon showing
the expected topology of AqpZ. The color of the helices indicates
the expected color of translational fusions ending after this helix
using the pKTop system. The arrow heads indicate the last residues
of the various fragments of AqpZ inserted into the pKTop reporter
system. The numbers within the helices indicate their first and last
residues, as determined by PyMOL. The positions of the mutations are
indicated in various helices. The NPA (Asparagine Proline Alanine)
labels indicate the incomplete helices that contain the conserved
NPA motif. (Bottom) Spots (7 μL) of overnight bacterial cultures
diluted to an OD600nm of 0.5 were placed on indicator plates
containing Red-Gal and BCIP and developed (see Materials
and Methods). The numbers along the top edge indicate the last
(C-terminal) helix in the construction, all constructions started
from the N-terminal of the protein. Blue color indicates a periplasmic
location of the C-terminal of the construction inserted into the plasmid
pKTop, whereas red color indicates a cytoplasmic location. The pKTop
control shows the result with no insert into the plasmid.

For this, we cloned N-terminal fragments of our
starting strain
AqpZ-C20S and the various single and double mutants, ending
after each transmembrane helix into the pKTop reporter plasmid. In
the C20S control strain, we note that the spots of cells
containing constructs ending after helices 1, 3, and 5 of AqpZ are
in blue color, indicating a periplasmic location, as expected. The
spots of cells containing constructs ending after helices 4 and 6
are in red color, indicating the expected cytoplasmic topology. However,
the spots containing the fusions ending after helix 2 are a deep purple
color, strongly suggesting only partial insertion of helix 2 into
the membrane, resulting in a mixed topology, and thus, a mixture of
red and blue color was developed. This topology information is fully
in agreement with the suggested importance of the interaction between
helices 1 and 3 in the folding of the protein around the central pore.38

Most of the different mutants result in
very similar patterns of
insertion. Importantly, all proteins show the expected blue and red
color for the constructs containing helices 5 and 6, respectively.
This confirms that they are targeted to the membranes and oriented
to give a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain.

Membrane protein overproduction
can often be toxic for cells. To
test the toxicity of our constructions, we grew a known amount of
them on minimal media either with glucose or glycerol as a carbon
source, Figure 3. As
can be readily appreciated, strains expressing certain mutant AQPs
are much less viable than others. The least viable cells were clearly
those expressing the A42F and A42F–I176G AqpZ variants, and the G144F mutation also
adversely affected cell viability. The situation is almost identical
on plates containing the two different carbon sources. Glycerol is
a nonfermentable substrate and thus can be used to test whether toxicity
was linked to difficulty in maintaining a membrane potential. The
microscopic examination of cultures expressing the different proteins
did reveal that the cells had a tendency to filament, and filamentation
was most prevalent in the least viable strains, namely, those expressing
the A42F, A42F–I176G, and
G144F AqpZ variants.

Figure 3 Toxicity of the different constructs.
The cultures of E. coli were diluted
overnight to an OD600 of 0.5, and the serially diluted
drops were spotted on M9 minimal
media, supplemented either with 0.5% (w/v) glucose (left) or with
0.5% (w/v) glycerol (right), and were incubated overnight at 37 °C.

2.1 Structural Analysis
To evaluate the
effects of our modifications on the assembly of AqpZ, we determined
the oligomerization state of the various modified proteins in several
different environments.

In several studies,4,39 oligomerization
of AqpZ has been followed after sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Usually, the native AqpZ is sufficiently
stable to remain tetrameric even after solubilization in SDS. As an
initial test, we, therefore, expressed the proteins in E. coli cells and examined the synthesis and oligomeric
state by SDS-PAGE and western blotting, Figure 4.

Figure 4 Western blot of an SDS-PAGE of E. coli cell pellets overexpressing the various AqpZ
constructs. The same
cell number (based on OD600nm) was loaded in each lane.
After electrophoresis and blotting, the N-terminal oligo-histidine
tag is targeted by the first antibody (Qiagen), and then the blot
was developed using alkaline-phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

In agreement with previous reports,4 AqpZ-C20S showed both tetrameric and monomeric forms
of AqpZ. In most mutants (W14A, G144F, I176G, and W14A–G144F), a single
band corresponding to monomeric AqpZ was observed. This indicates
that there is a reasonable level of protein production and that the
tetrameric structure has, as expected, been destabilized. In the strains
expressing the A42F and A42F–I176G forms of the protein, a very little amount of protein was accumulated,
only weak staining of the blot was observed, and no clear band was
observed. Although protein production was limited in these strains,
we did manage to purify the expressed protein, and after purification,
they were found to be monomeric on SDS-PAGE, see Figure S1.

To gain further insight into the oligomeric
state, the various
different proteins were purified in the detergent dodecyl maltoside
for the structural analysis. The oligomeric state of the purified
proteins was investigated by both size exclusion chromatography and
dynamic light scattering (DLS), Figure 5, and the results are collected in Table 1.

The different proteins showed various different sizes that were
readily distinguished using size exclusion chromatography. The reference
C20S strain eluted at Kd of
about 4.25. Some proteins eluted slightly earlier, for example, the
I176G mutant shown in Figure 5. While others were clearly much smaller,
as illustrated for the W14A mutant. In light scattering,
the various purified proteins gave relatively monodisperse peaks with
characteristic size.

The volumes of the AqpZ monomer and tetramer,
calculated from the
crystallographic structure, are 32.2 and 129.8 nm3, respectively.
These volumes are smaller than those of the protein–detergent
complex present in the solution because hundreds of detergent molecules
form a belt around the hydrophobic part of the membrane protein.40

Using size exclusion chromatography, the
different AqpZ proteins
fall into two groups. A first group with a volume of about 195 nm3 contains the C20S, G144F, I176G, and W14A–G144F proteins. These proteins
are presumably tetramers, in view of the observed size and the known
structure of AqpZ. The small differences in size observed are possibly
due to slight variations in the amount of detergent binding. A second
group with a protein–detergent complex volume about half as
large of 82 nm3 contains the W14A mutant and
the two most toxic proteins A42F and A42F–I176G.

The results using DLS for the first group of proteins
are entirely
coherent with those obtained by using chromatography. All four proteins
have similar sizes, although using this method of about 265 nm3. For the second group, the situation is more complex. The
W14A protein, as in the chromatographic measurements, shows
a hydrodynamic size almost exactly half that of the first group of
proteins. The last two proteins show less consistent behavior, possibly
associated with the higher protein concentrations in these measurements.
The A42F mutant shows a size intermediate between that
of the first group and W14A, whereas the A42F–I176G protein shows a much larger hydrodynamic
volume.

Both methods, chromatography and DLS, have some potential
difficulties
with membrane proteins. As the detergent belt and the protein do not
have uniform dielectric properties, we expect some systematic errors
in the DLS analysis as a uniform diffusing particle is assumed. Furthermore,
the presence of empty detergent micelles might influence the result,
though these are expected to be smaller than the protein complexes
and so contribute less signal. The measurement of size using chromatography
is also made difficult by detergent binding to the column and standard
proteins, and thus, systematic errors are expected. Thus, while the
absolute sizes reported by these two methods are perhaps not exceedingly
accurate, the relative measurements are probably reliable.

Altogether,
these hydrodynamic measurements suggest that in dodecyl
maltoside the protein–detergent complexes of the first group,
C20S, G144F, I176G, and W14A–G144F, probably contain tetrameric AqpZ proteins,
with about equal masses of protein and detergent in agreement with
previous studies on similar proteins in the same detergent.40 On the basis of the geometry of the protein–detergent
complex proposed in previous studies, the proportion of protein in
smaller complexes is reduced. Indeed if the geometric parameters obtained
previously40 are used to estimate the size
of a detergent belt around a monomeric AQP, the total protein–detergent
complex volume should be about half that of the tetramer. On the basis
of these estimations, it seems reasonable to conclude that the smaller
sizes observed in chromatography, and by DLS for the W14A protein, correspond to monomeric AQPs, formed by destabilizing
the hydrophobic interface. Although the measured size might be consistent
with a dimer, we believe in view of the monomeric state in the stronger
detergent SDS and the detergent binding requirement that a monomer
is a more reasonable explanation of our measurements. Clearly, the
results from the two proteins, A42F and A42F–I176G, are not entirely satisfactory, with differences between
the two methods used. This might be attributed to the difficulties
in the production of the proteins or in our opinion problems with
stability and aggregation linked to higher protein concentration and
a less well-controlled protein–detergent ratio in DLS measurements.

Altogether, these measurements show that AqpZ in solution with
the mild detergent dodecyl maltoside is tetrameric. The oligomeric
structure is robust enough to accommodate the removal of the knob
created by I176 and the steric clash created by the G144F mutation. However, in this environment, the W14A mutation, and probably the A42F mutation as well, results
in monomeric AQPs. Furthermore, the size estimations also suggest
that the detergent belt is organized in a manner similar to that proposed
for Aqp0,40 with almost as much detergent
around a monomer as a tetramer.

To verify that changes in the
quaternary structure were not linked
to modifications in the secondary structure, we measured circular
dichroism (CD) spectra of the various purified proteins (Figure 6).

Figure 6 CD spectra of AqpZ proteins.
The CD spectra of the purified proteins
in dodecyl maltoside were measured and normalized to give the mean
residue ellipticity. Shown is the spectrum obtained for the reference
protein C20S, and difference spectra for each of the mutant
proteins, vertically offset to aid visualization.

The CD spectrum of AqpZ is typical of a largely α helical
protein, with strong negative peaks at 208 and 222 nm. Indeed, the
secondary structure analysis using the K2D241 algorithm identified the same composition for all proteins, reporting
87.8% α helices, 11.7% random coil, entirely consistent with
the known AqpZ structures. However, not all spectra are identical,
the height of the peak at 195 nm was slightly reduced in the various
mutants, and this may suggest some modifications to the loops or be
due to acquisition problems at these low wavelengths. The largest
difference spectrum is that for the double mutant A42F–I176G that gives a less negative signal at 208 nm, resulting
in a modified ratio of the minima, ϕ222/ϕ208 of 0.97 as opposed to 1.13 found for the other proteins.
This change in CD spectrum might be attributed to an increase in scattering,
flattening, changes in local dielectric constant,42 or a reduction in interhelical coupling.43 Surprisingly, this change was not reflected by an increase
in the α-helical content as predicted by K2D2, as might have
been expected.43

These measurements
show that the secondary structure of the proteins,
as determined by K2D2, is unperturbed by the mutations, and there
is no apparent coupling between the secondary structure and the formation
of tetramers for AqpZ, even in the detergent solution.

Unfortunately,
the activity of AQPs cannot be measured in the detergent
solution; thus to verify the effects of destabilizing mutations on
activity, we reconstituted the proteins into proteoliposomes. The
activity was then measured by monitoring light scattering after hyperosmotic
shock, Figure 7. However,
we were unable to prepare sufficient purified protein to permit activity
measurements on the A42F and A42F–I176G proteins.

Figure 7 Measurements of water permeation in proteoliposomes. Proteoliposomes
were submitted to an abrupt hyperosmotic shock, followed by light
scattering changes. (Panel A) Liposomes (circles) containing no protein
and a single exponential fit to the data (line). Residuals are plotted
in the bottom on an expanded scale. (Panel B) Tetrameric AqpZ-C20S was reconstituted at different protein-to-lipid ratios,
and scattering changes were measured. Shown are data from vesicles
with ratios of 0.010 (filled triangles), 0.001 (open diamonds), and
0.000 (open squares). (Panel C) Kinetics measured for proteoliposomes
reconstituted with AqpZ-W14A (open diamonds), G144F (filled squares), and W14A–G144F (open
squares) proteins all at a protein/lipid ratio of 0.001.

When reconstituted in liposomes, made from E. coli total lipid extract, light scattering changes
can be observed owing
to vesicle shrinkage because of the water moving out of the vesicles,
following a decrease in the external osmotic pressure. The observed
changes can be fitted to a single exponential, Figure 7, panel A. The characteristic time we observed
for vesicle swelling in the absence of AqpZ was about 0.3 s. When
AqpZ C20S is introduced into the liposomes at a protein/lipid
ratio of 0.001, in panel B diamonds, the permeability increased and
the characteristic time was reduced to about 0.1 s, increasing the
protein concentration 10-fold; in panel B filled triangles, the rate
of scattering changes increased to below the time resolution of our
experimental setup. These results are entirely consistent with those
obtained previously for this protein.4 We
measured kinetics for proteoliposomes containing the different proteins,
panel C, to measure the water conduction activity of each protein.
The curves obtained with the C20S, G144F, and
W14A–G144F proteins reconstituted into
liposomes were very similar; however, a reduced permeability was observed
when the monomeric W14A mutant was incorporated into liposomes.

The characteristic time for proteoliposome shrinkage depends on
the surface-to-volume ratio of the liposomes and the permeability
of the membrane. We estimated the permeability of the membrane from
single exponential fits to the light scattering data and the average
size of the liposomes measured by DLS. From the change in this value
and the protein density, the single channel permeabilities can in
turn be estimated. These values are shown in Table 2. It is immediately clear from these measurements
that the three tetrameric proteins tested show high permeability between
9.5 and 11.3 × 10–14 cm3 s–1. These values are in complete agreement with previous observations.4 The monomeric W14A mutant has a much
smaller permeability by only about 4.1 × 10–14 cm3 s–1.

It is particularly interesting to note that the reduced
membrane
permeability in the monomeric W14A mutant is almost completely
restored in the tetrameric W14A–G144F
double mutant.

3 Discussion
AQPs
are a family of tetrameric membrane proteins; however, the
functional role of this oligomerization and the forces driving the
assembly are not clear. In the present work, we have modified the
membrane-embedded interfaces of the AqpZ protein, making mutations
designed to cause steric clashes and the formation of holes.

In studies of GlpF folding, it has been suggested that the protein
folds in two subdomains containing helices 1 to 3 and 4 to 6.44 Within each subdomain, it is proposed that interactions
between the parallel helices (1 and 3 or 4 and 6) are crucial for
the folding of the respective subdomains, whereas the antiparallel
interaction between helices 2 and 5 connects the two subdomains. This
is slightly different from the model proposed for Aqp145 in which the antiparallel interaction between
helices 2 and 5 drives, in a concerted rearrangement, the insertion
of helices 2 and 4 and the reorientation of helix 3. Our protein topology
experiments allow us to follow the assembly of AqpZ. The constructs
containing helices 1–2 appear to show a mixed topology, whereas
those containing helices 1–3 show a single “correct”
topology. The constructs containing helices 1–4 also appear
to show a “correct” topology. These observations suggest
that during the folding of AqpZ, similar to the model proposed for
GlpF,44 the parallel interaction between
helices 1 and 3 stabilizes insertion of helix 2. Examining the mutants,
this insertion may also be stabilized by tryptophan at position 14
and phenylalanine at position 42. Presumably, this second effect is
due to the increased hydrophobicity of phenylalanine compared to that
of alanine. However, the interaction between helices 4 and 6 appears
less important for the insertion of helix 5. Furthermore, unlike Aqp1,45 the interaction between helices 2 and 5 does
not appear to be required for the correct topology. These observations
on multiple members of the same family would tend to suggest that
the two-stage model for membrane protein folding46,47 is over simplistic because membrane insertion can be linked to assembly
and furthermore that whereas structure is conserved the folding pathway
is not.

The first role proposed for the tetrameric nature of
AQPs was as
a requirement for stable integration into the bilayer.48 However, calculations of the free energy transfer
for the various transmembrane helices of GlpF and other members of
the family suggest that this is not the case.38 Furthermore, several mutated monomeric AQPs have been studied: for
example, a human Aqp4 with a V71M mutation in the first
incomplete helix,19 or GlpF with an E43A,18 which appears to insert correctly
in the membrane. In agreement with these previous studies, our monomeric
W14A mutant also appears to insert normally into the membrane.
Thus, in partial accord with the two-stage model for membrane protein
folding,46,47 there does not appear to be a link between
insertion and oligomerization.

Several previous studies have
examined the link between the tetramer
formation and the permeability of AQPs. In Aqp4, the V71M mutation decreased the oligomer assembly, but the resulting monomer
has water permeability comparable to WT-Aqp4.19 By contrast, in Aqp2, the R187C mutation results in inactive
monomers.49 Similarly, the monomeric GlpF
protein with the E43A mutation18 shows reduced activity. In this study, we again show a link between
oligomerization and activity for an AQP. Perhaps most convincingly,
while the W14A mutant is both monomeric and has reduced
activity, the oligomeric state and transport activity are both restored
by the compensating second-site mutation G144F.

It
is not entirely clear why there should be a link between the
oligomeric state and permeability; however, it is noteworthy that
in several different proteins of the family, in different laboratories,
with mutations in different parts of the protein this association
has been found. It seems unlikely that there are major changes in
the tertiary structure between monomeric and tetrameric proteins,
and it is clear from the CD spectra that there are minimal modifications
in the secondary and supra-secondary structure. Thus, changes are
likely restricted to subtle structural changes or changes in dynamics,
resulting in a transition between an open and a closed state.50 One possibility is that the monomer is sensitive
to the membrane lateral pressure, resulting in conversion to a closed
state, whereas the tetramer is protected from such deformation. For
example, the 90° angle at the C4 symmetry
axis might have a tendency to change slightly in a monomeric protein
favoring a closed state, whereas in the tetramer such a deformation
is hindered.

It is remarkable that of the different point mutations
we have
made, designed to disrupt the tetrameric structure, we appear to have
been successful in two out of four attempts W14A and A42F and failed with the other two G144F and I176G.

The W14 residue is located in the middle
of an “aromatic
tetrad”, formed by F10, F13, W14, and F17. We hypothesize that the interactions among
the remaining three aromatic residues reduce the possibility for reorganization
of the structure, and thus, the mutation results in a large hole in
the interface. This hole is very hydrophobic and able to strongly
bind lipid, or detergent, molecules, and these hinder the formation
of the protein–protein contacts in the tetramer. However, in
the presence of the G144F mutation, the lipids can be displaced
by the phenylalanyl residue. The A42F mutation appears
to introduce a steric clash that is sufficiently severe to disrupt
the interface. By contrast, we must assume that for the other point
mutations the interface is able to reorganize and thus limit the steric
clash or the size of the hole in the structure.

It is worth
pointing out that the energetics of interface disruption
in a lipid environment is expected to be rather different from that
observed for soluble proteins. Water offers a small molecule isotropic
environment. Thus, in an aqueous environment, small interfacial holes
can be readily filled by a water molecule,51 causing a minimal energy penalty. Equally steric clashes can lead
to rearrangements, allowing a few water molecules to infiltrate the
interface.52 In the case of a phospholipid
environment, the situation is rather different. The environment is
strongly anisotropic. The entry of water into the hydrophobic core
of the membrane is energetically unfavorable, but the large anisotropic
solvent molecules cannot fill interfacial holes without seriously
disrupting the interface. In the same way, relieving steric clashes
by allowing solvent infiltration into the interface is geometrically
more complex because of the large size and specific shape of the solvent
molecules. This reasoning suggests that the lipid-embedded interfaces
may be more fragile than the interfaces in aqueous environments because
of the reduced possibility of solvent infiltration. In particular,
we suspect that part of the difference in the behavior of the W14A and I176G mutants is due to the ease with which
the lipids can solvate the monomer surface. The remains of the aromatic
tetrad provide a relatively good anchor for lipid molecules compared
with the smaller holes left by the removal of the isoleucine side
chain. These observations are entirely coherent with those on the
ClC transporter, in which a single I → W mutation can lead
to the destabilization of almost 10 kJ mol–1.27

We have previously proposed53 that the
membrane protein assembly into oligomers is in part driven by lipophobic
interactions, resulting from the perturbation by the protein of lipid–lipid
interactions. The mutants we describe here offer an interesting system
to study the influence of lipid–protein interactions on the
membrane protein assembly. Intriguingly, none of the mutations showed
evidence of a dynamic monomer–tetramer equilibrium, for example,
by the presence of multiple peaks or unexpectedly wide peaks in light
scattering or gel filtration. Perhaps this indicates a strong sensitivity
of association constant to small changes at the interface. In this
context, the inability of the I176G and G144F mutations to disrupt the tetramer would indicate that, despite
similar volume changes at the interface to the other mutations, they
can easily accommodate in the protein structure or provide less easily
solvated surfaces.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Protein
synthesis was driven from plasmids derived from the previously described
pTrc-10His-AqpZ-C20S plasmid.4 Mutations were introduced using the megaprimer method,54 using the oligonucleotides in Table 3. DNA sequences were verified
by sequencing (GATC Biotech, Mulhouse).

4.2 Protein
Production
Competent E. coli strain W3110 cells were freshly transformed
with the appropriate plasmid and were grown on Luria broth plates
supplemented with a 25 μg/mL ampicillin at 37 °C. A single
colony was selected, and a culture was grown overnight in Luria broth
containing 25 μg/mL ampicillin as antibiotic and 0.4% glucose
at 37 °C. This culture was diluted 100-fold into a fresh broth
supplemented with 0.4% glucose and was grown to an optical density
(OD) at 600 nm of at least 1.2. To induce aqpZ gene
expression, 1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thio-galacto-pyranoside
(IPTG) was then added, and the culture was incubated for a further
3 h at 30 °C.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation, 20
min at 9000g, and resuspended in 1/200th of the original
culture volume of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 100 mM K2HPO4, pH 7.0; 1 mM MgSO4; 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF); and 0.1 mg/mL deoxyribonuclease 1. Cells were broken
by sonication, 3 cycles of 1 min each followed by 1 min at 4 °C.
Unbroken cells and debris were separated from the cell lysate by centrifugation,
30 min at 10 000g. Membrane fragments in the
supernatant were collected by centrifugation, 60 min at 140 000g, and then the membrane pellet was solubilized overnight
at 4 °C in solubilization buffer: 100 mM K2HPO4, pH 8.0; 200 mM NaCl; and 3% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) (Sigma-Aldrich). The insoluble material was
removed by centrifugation, 60 min at 140 000g.

4.3 Protein Purification
AQPs were purified
from the detergent solubilized supernatant by affinity using a His-Trap
HP column (GE Healthcare) attached to an ÄKTA system (GE Healthcare).
The column was equilibrated with 10 column volumes (CV) of wash buffer:
100 mM K2HPO4, pH 8.0; 200 mM NaCl; 0.05% DDM;
and 50 mM imidazole. The solubilized proteins were loaded onto the
column, and the column was then washed with 5 CV of wash buffer to
remove nonspecifically bound material. Elution was performed with
a 10 CV gradient from 0 to 100% elution buffer: 100 mM K2HPO4, pH 8.0; 200 mM NaCl; 0.05% DDM; and 500 mM imidazole.
Fractions containing AqpZ were pooled and washed in Microsep columns
(VWR, 10k cutoff) with 5 CV of conservation buffer (NaCl 137 mM, KCl
2.7 mM, K2HPO4 1.4 mM, Na2HPO4 16.29 mM, 0.05% DDM, pH 8.0).

4.4 Size
Exclusion Chromatography
The
hydrodynamic sizes of protein–detergent complexes can be estimated
by using size exclusion chromatography on appropriate columns. Pure
AqpZ (1 mg) was injected in 500 μL on a Superose 6 10/300 GL
(GE Healthcare) column previously equilibrated with elution buffer
(NaCl 200 mM, KCl 2.7 mM, K2HPO4 1.4 mM, Na2HPO4 16.29 mM, 0.05% DDM, pH 8.0). The column was
developed with the same buffer.

To determine the volumes of
protein–detergent complexes, the Superose 6 10/300 GL column
was calibrated, using the Gel Filtration Calibration Kit HMW (GE Healthcare)
supplemented with lysozyme (14 kDa) and Atto532 in elution buffer.
The partition coefficient, Kd, for each
protein was calculated from Kd = (Vm – Vo)/(Vt – Vo),
where Vo is the void volume determined
with blue dextran, Vt is the geometric
bed volume determined with Atto532, and Vm is the elution volume at the peak monitored by absorbance at 280
nm. The volumes of the proteins in the calibration kit were estimated
by assuming a protein density of 1.212 × 10–3 nm3 Da–1.55

4.5 Dynamic Light Scattering
The hydrodynamic
sizes of protein–detergent complexes and liposomes were also
estimated by DLS. For protein samples, a concentration of about 1
mg/mL was used.

For this, we used a Zetasizer Nano-series Nano-S
instrument (Malvern). Samples were briefly equilibrated for 300 s
at 25 °C. Default settings in the software were used for optimizing
measurement settings and duration. The multiple narrow mode analysis
of the correlation data was used to obtain volume-based particle size
distributions using the manufacturer’s software.

4.6 Topology Evaluation
In vivo orientation
of membrane proteins can be examined using translational fusions with
the proteins β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase because
alkaline phosphatase is only active in the periplasm, whereas β-galactosidase
requires cytoplasmic localization for activity.

To control the
correct insertion of the α helices of the mutant AqpZ in the
membrane, we amplified the appropriate gene fragment by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) using the oligonucleotides shown in Table 4, which was digested
with HindIII and XbaI before overnight ligation at 16 °C into
the pKTop plasmid56 previously digested
with the same enzymes. The ligation mixture was then transformed into
competent E. coli DH5α cells.

A freshly transformed colony was selected, and the
cells were grown
overnight, diluted to an OD600nm of 0.5, and 7 μL
was spotted onto dual-indicator plates. These plates contain Luria
broth agar supplemented with the indicators 80 μg/mL disodium
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) and 100 μg/mL 6-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (Red-Gal), the inducer 1 mM IPTG, and the antibiotic
50 μg/mL kanamycin. Plates were developed overnight at 37 °C.

4.7 Toxicity Assay
As membrane protein
production is toxic, we evaluated the effects of AqpZ synthesis on
cell growth. A freshly transformed colony containing the appropriate
plasmid in the W3110 strain was selected, and the cells were grown
overnight, diluted to an OD600nm of 0.5. A 50% serial dilution
was then prepared. Samples of 7 μL were spotted onto M9 minimal
media agar plates, supplemented with either 0.5% (w/v) glucose or
0.5% (w/v) glycerol, and the cells were grown overnight at 37 °C
before scoring.

4.8 Circular Dichroism
UV CD spectra
were acquired on a Jasco J-815 CD spectrometer using the same 0.1
cm cuvette for all purified AqpZ mutants. Proteins were dialyzed for
2 h at 4 °C against 1000 volumes of 0.05% (w/v) DDM to reduce
sodium absorption. The spectra were acquired with a resolution of
0.2 nm with an integration time of 1 s, and 20 scans were accumulated,
with baseline being set to zero from 245 to 260 nm. To compare spectra
from different mutants, the ellipticity was converted from millidegree
(mdeg) to mean residue ellipticity [ϕ]MR using the
formula [ϕ]MR = (MMRW × ϕ)/(10 × l × c), where MMRW is the average amino acid
residue weight = 110 Da, ϕ is the measured ellipticity in mdeg, l is the path length = 0.1 cm, and c is
the protein concentration in mg/mL. Protein concentrations between
0.5 and 3.0 mg/mL were used in these experiments. The secondary structure
composition was calculated by a K2D2 algorithm.41

4.9 Proteoliposome Reconstitution
Purified
AqpZ-C20S and AqpZ-W14A were reconstituted into
proteoliposomes essentially as previously described.4 Briefly, 10 mg of E. coli total lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc) was resuspended in
1:2 methanol/chloroform solution, dried under nitrogen flow followed
by 30 min under vacuum. Lipids were vortexed with MOPS (3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic
acid) 100 mM, NMDG (N-methyl-d-glucamine)
50 mM, pH 7.5 buffer for resuspension. Then, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was added, and then the OD was measured at
280 nm until a clear suspension was obtained. The lipid–detergent
mixture was equilibrated overnight at room temperature. Purified AqpZ
was then added to give a 1:100 or 1:1000 protein/lipid ratio (w/w),
and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Reconstitution
was performed by dialysis in 20k MINI Dialysis Devices (Thermo Scientific)
against 100 volumes of a MOPS 100 mM, NMDG 50 mM buffer for 72 h at
room temperature. Buffer was changed after 48 h. After dialysis, the
proteoliposomes were passed 11 times through an extruder (Avanti Polar
Lipids Inc.) fitted with a 200 nm polycarbonate membrane to reduce
size heterogeneity. Liposome size was evaluated by DLS. While protein
recovery was close to 100%, it is not entirely clear how homogeneous
the protein/lipid ratio is.

4.10 Kinetic Measurements
The osmotic
behavior of proteoliposomes was analyzed by following the light scattering
at 600 nm with a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin-Yvon, Lonjumeau)
after rapidly mixing equal volumes of proteoliposomes (100 μL
each) and hyperosmolar buffer in a stopped-flow apparatus accessory
SFA-20 Hi-Tech Scientific (TgK Scientific, United Kingdom). The liposomes
were prepared in 100 mM MOPS, 50 mM NMDG, pH 7.5 hyperosmolar buffer,
containing in addition 157 mM sucrose.

Proteoliposomes permeabilities
were calculated with the following equation  where k (in s–1) is the rate constant obtained
by fitting the light scattered data
to a simple exponential; r is the liposome radius,
measured by DLS; vw is the partial molar
volume of water (0.018 L·mol–1); and Δosm is the difference in osmolarity between the extra and the
intravesicular compartment (0.0785 mol·L–1).
