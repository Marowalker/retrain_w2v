Supramolecular self-assembly
of an octaphosphonate tetraphenyl
porphyrin with three different nucleobases (adenine, cytosine, and
thymine) was studied. Porphyrin 1 with 8 and 10 equiv
of cytosine produces light-harvesting ring-like structures, that is,
architectures similar to those observed in natural light-harvesting
antenna. However, porphyrin assembled with adenine or thymine resulted
in prisms and microrods, respectively. UV–vis absorption, fluorescence,
and dynamic light scattering were used to determine the mode of aggregation
in solution. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy
used to visualize the self-assembled nanostructures and their behavior
in the solid state, respectively. Thus, we believe that this study
may demonstrate a deeper understanding on how one needs to manipulate
donor/acceptor subunits in supramolecular assemblies to construct
artificial antenna architectures.

1 Introduction
The
fabrication of highly ordered nanostructures of chromophores
via self-assembly is an active area of research with diverse applications
in materials science.1 The evolutionary
process in natural molecular structures such as a light-harvesting
system employed in photosynthesis by purple bacteria and green plants
constructed via self-assembly of chromophoric arrays has been used
as inspiration.2 In purple photosynthetic
bacteria, the light-harvesting antenna systems LH1 and LH2 are created
by the circular arrangement of chromophores and small biopolymers
having ∼54 amino acids, which bind to Mg in BChl a.2,3 X-ray crystal structure analyses of antenna systems have revealed
the precise arrangement of pigments embedded in photosynthetic membranes
and their position in proteins.2,3b,3c More recently, atomic force microscopy studies have shown similar
results.3a The chromophore pigments are
tightly held by protein scaffolds at precise intermolecular distances
to control the energy and electron transfer.4 The absorption of light by the photosynthetic reaction centers stabilizes
an exciton, which consists of an electron and a hole pair, on opposite
sides of the photosynthetic membrane.5 In
the photosynthetic light-harvesting antenna systems LH1 and LH2, the
chromophoric pigment arrays are organized in ring-shaped nanostructures.6

Researchers have attempted to use the natural
photosynthetic system
as a blueprint to fabricate artificial photosystems that can capture
light efficiently.7 It is not necessary
to identically reproduce the natural system to achieve large-scale
photosynthetic devices, even though polypeptides with ∼54 amino
acids are synthetically feasible. To construct ring-shaped ordered
arrays of pigments, most of the artificial photosynthetic antenna
systems have been created via covalent bond forming synthetic procedures.8 The creation of functional artificial antenna
systems via self-assembly of pigments by noncovalent interactions
utilizing H-bonding, hydrophobic, dipole-dipole, van der Waals interaction,
π–π stacking, and solvophobic effects is a desirable
alternative approach.9 To achieve the precise
arrangement of the monomers in a dynamic and thermodynamically stable
antenna system, the careful design of the chromophore pigments with
specific molecular recognition sites are required.

Nolte and
coworkers have shown that “ring-like” porphyrin
based arrays can form by the evaporation of organic solutions containing
molecular precursors on a substrate.10 They
presume that formation of ring-like structures is driven by evaporation
of the solvent and its wetting/nonwetting characteristics. The self-assembly
of TPPS4 porphyrin into wheel-like structures was reported
in 2005 by Rodaite et al.11 Kobuke et al.
have shown that a zinc-containing porphyrin with imidazole as a molecular
recognition site yields stable macrocyclic arrays.12 The same group further reported a macromolecular complex,
containing 30 porphyrins bridged with ferrocene, that is, 10.5 nm
in diameter when imaged on an Au(111) surface by using low-temperature
ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy.13 The hexamer and dodecamer porphyrin arrays self-assemble
into macrometer-sized ring structures, with evaporation of the solvent
on the surface and assembly driven by a “pinhole” mechanism.14 The supramolecular self-assembly of TPE-based
porphyrins into ring-like structures via solvophobic control was reported
in 2015 by our group.15 In 2016, Balaban
et al. have shown that solvent composition plays an important role
to switch the assembly of porphyrin–phenylalanine–phenylalanine
conjugates into fibrils, platelets, and nanospheres.16 Very recently, Iida et al. have demonstrated the self-assembly
of porphyrin containing macroscopic anisotropic structures by a light-induced
solvothermal assembly.17 Nucleobases are
important building blocks present as subunits in biomacromolecules
such as DNA and RNAs, among them pyrimidine and purines are involved
in the formation of the DNA double helix structure via H-bonding,18 and have been employed to fabricate functional
materials.19

Recently, we reported
on the formation of nanowires, nanorods,
spherical, and chiral assemblies from octaphosphonate-tetraphenyl-porphyrin 1 with or without guest molecules.20,21 In this manuscript, we present the self-assembly of porphyrin 1 with the nucleobase cytosine (C) at a range of molecular
ratios (Figure 1).
We found that cytosine triggered the assembly of porphyrin 1 into a light-harvesting antenna-like ring system at molecular ratios
between 1 and 8. In contrast, in the presence of adenine (A) or thymine
(Th), porphyrin 1 self-assembled into the prism and microrod
morphologies, respectively.

study.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 UV–Vis Absorbance Spectroscopy
The UV–vis
absorbance spectrum of porphyrin 1 in water shows Soret
band maxima at 440 nm with a shoulder peak
at 418 nm along with four weak Q-bands at 516, 558, 602, and 660 nm
(Figure 2a).20 Typically, tetraphenyl-porphyrin15 is known to absorb in the region around 420
nm, however, the large red-shift of 1 is perhaps attributed
to the protonation of porphyrin by the phosphonate groups.20 This is more evident upon the addition of cytosine
as a guest molecule. The UV–vis spectra of porphyrin 1 during titration with cytosine are shown in Figure 2a. The titration reveals significant
changes in absorbance, indicative of an interaction between the analyte
and the chromophore. No significant change in absorbance peaks was
detected at 1 and 2 equiv of cytosine. However further incremental
additions of cytosine from 4 to 48 equiv led to a decrease in both
the Soret band at 440 nm and the Q-band at 660 nm, while the intensity
of the shoulder peak at 418 nm increased. These changes in the absorbance
spectra can be attributed to H-bonding between porphyrin phosphonic
acid and cytosine, which is acting as the base. At 48 equiv of cytosine,
the absorbance maxima at 440, 418, and 660 nm are saturated. The decrease
in peak intensity at 440 nm and increase in peak intensity at 418
nm led to an isosbestic point at 429 nm, suggesting the presence of
two species in solution.

Figure 2 (a) UV–vis absorbance, (b) and emission
spectrums of porphyrin 1 (1 × 10–4 M), and porphyrin 1: cytosine at molecular ratios between
1:0 and 1:48 equiv.

In order to confirm the
strong interaction of porphyrin 1 with cytosine, we have
compared with other nucleobases such as (uracil,
guanine, thymine, and adenine). However, a clear interaction and novel
morphologies were observed with cytosine and we have not observed
a marked interaction in the case of other tested nucleobases as shown
in the Supporting Information Figures S1
and S2. Such a comparison could give clear evidence of the exclusive
interaction of cytosine with porphyrin 1. The incremental
addition of A and Th led to no significant changes in the UV–vis
absorbance spectra of porphyrin 1. Figure S1a,b show the UV–vis absorbance spectra of
porphyrin 1 with the addition of A and Th (0–48
equiv). With the addition of A or Th, the absorbance maxima of porphyrin 1 at 440 nm, the shoulder peak at 418 nm and the intense Q-band
at 660 nm showed a 30% decrease in peak intensities (Figure S1a). These results suggest that the aggregation of
porphyrin 1 with A and Th proceeds via a different mode.
Hereafter, the mode of aggregation of cytosine with porphyrin 1 is discussed in detail. In addition, the changes in electronic
absorption spectra and an obvious blue shift in the absorbance spectra
upon the addition of cytosine is attributed to the self-assembled
nanostructure through place via H-type aggregates (opposite phenomenon
to J-aggregates)22 along with strong H-bonding
between phosphonic acid of porphyrin and the amino functional group
of cytosine.

2.2 Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The fluorescence
emission spectra of porphyrin 1 in the presence of the
nucleobases (C, A, and Th) was also examined in water (Figure 2b, and Supporting Information Figure S2a,b). The fluorescence spectrum
of porphyrin 1 exhibits an emission band at 680 nm when
excited at 418 nm. The emission spectra of porphyrin 1: cytosine at 0–48 equiv is shown in Figure 2b. In the presence of 1 equiv of cytosine,
the emission peak intensity of porphyrin 1 increased.
With further incremental addition of cytosine (2–12 equiv),
the emission spectra displayed an increase in quantum yield. The quantum
yield of porphyrin 1 in the protonated form was shown
to be 0.10, which is comparable to standard reference tetraphenyl-porphyrin
(ΦF = 0.11).22 Interestingly,
porphyrin 1 in the presence of 8 equiv of cytosine gives
ΦF = 0.21 and 10 equiv gives ΦF =
0.23. With the further addition of cytosine (24 and 48 equiv), the
emission peak of porphyrin 1 split into two peaks at
660 and 720 nm, this split of fluorescence emission was upon self-assembly
there is limited electronic communication between porphyrin cores
because of the network of H-bonding through adding excess of cytosine
(Figure 2b).

We contrasted the self-assembly behavior of A and Th with porphyrin 1 compared with C in solution, and the fluorescence spectra
of porphyrin 1 titrated with A and Th show similar behavior
to C during titration (Figure S2a,b). We
extended the examination of fluorescent emission of porphyrin 1 via titration with a common base, that is, triethylamine
(Figure S2c). It can be clearly seen that
upon incremental addition of trimethylamine (0–48 equiv) decreasing
fluorescence emission was observed, it was probably due to deprotonation
of porphyrin 1 and this behavior is the complete opposite
to the self-assembly of porphyrin 1 in the presence of
nucleobases (Figure 2b).

2.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy
Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the morphology of
microstructures of the self-assembled porphyrin 1–cytosine
with 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 molecular ratios deposited on a silicon wafer
by solvent evaporation, shown in Figures S3–S5 with the mechanism details described. Compound 1–cytosine
self-assembled into microflower-like structures. These fractal structures
ranged between 5 and 10 μm in diameter.

Increasing the
molecular ratios porphyrin 1–cytosine to 8 equiv
of cytosine gave a wheel-like circular arrangement after solvent evaporation
(Figure 3a). The wheel-like
arrangement grew larger and more defined at a 1:10 molecular ratio
(Figure 3b). At 1:8
and 1:10 porphyrin 1–cytosine molecular ratios
fractal structures also were seen coexisting with the wheel-like circular
microstructures (Figure S6). Their average
wheel diameter was approximately 5 μm at 1:8 and 10 μm
at 1:10 porphyrin 1–cytosine self-assemblies (Figure 3c,d), respectively.
The wheel-like arrangement appears to be composed of nanocrystallites
stacked radially to form a hole in the middle. The inner diameter
of the hole is approximately 2–4 μm.

Figure 3 SEM micrographs of the
supramolecular self-assembly of porphyrin 1 (1 ×
10–4 M) in the presence of various
ratios of cytosine: (a,c) 8 and (b,d) 10 equiv after solvent evaporation
on a silicon wafer. The noncovalent acid–base interactions
between porphyrin 1 and cytosine produces ring-like structures.

SEM was also used to investigate
the morphology of microstructures
of the self-assembled porphyrin 1–cytosine with
1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 molecular ratios deposited on a silicon wafer by
solvent evaporation, shown in Figure 4 with the mechanism details described. Compound 1–cytosine self-assembled into microflower-like structures.
These fractal structures ranged between 5 and 10 μm in diameter.
As a base, cytosine probes porphyrin 1 for the best position
of interaction to form the most stable noncovalent acid–base
bond. Porphyrin 1 possessed two acidic positions; the
phosphonic groups with pKa1 = 3.0, and the acidic pyrrole subunits of the porphyrin core with
pKa2 = 5.6, while the second
phosphoric proton had a pKa3 = 8.0. Therefore, cytosine coordinates with the phosphonic acid
moieties of the porphyrin 1 molecule vis two H-bonds
as shown in Figure 4d. The 8 peripheral phosphonic acid moieties are first consumed to
form the in-plane complex. Beyond the 1:8 coordination, cytosine starts
taking the axial position where the pyrrole subunits are deprotonated
and the porphyrin core interacts with cytosine electrostatically,
which is based on their acidic and basic properties, respectively.23

and axial positions.

In order to gain an insight into the nucleobase-triggered
supramolecular
self-assembling behavior of porphyrin 1, we also studied
the assembly of A and Th. The results are presented in Figures S7 and S8, respectively. It was observed
that in the presence of 10 equiv of A, porphyrin 1 was
assembled into a microprism with a crystalline morphology of ∼5–8
μm size (Figure S7), while porphyrin 1 co-assembly with
Th (10 equiv) produced microneedles tens of microns in length with
up to a 10 μm square cross section (Figure S8).

2.4 X-ray Diffraction
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) confirmed the crystallinity of porphyrin 1 upon
self-assembly with C, A, and Th as shown in Figure S9. Porphyrin 1 did not exhibit any peak, confirming
that the material does not crystalize alone. The XRD pattern of porphyrin 1 with cytosine at a 10 equiv molar ratio displays three peaks,
a highly intense peak at 36° and a less intense peaks at 24°
and 36°, indicating a crystalline structure in the aggregated
state. It was observed that the XRD pattern of porphyrin 1 in the presence of A (10 equiv) shows an intense, sharp peak at
24° with two other less intense peaks at 20° and 35°,
also suggesting crystalline morphology formation. Porphyrin 1 with the addition of Th resulted in two intense XRD pattern
peaks at around 28° and 31°. These results indicate that
in the presence of nucleobases C, A, and Th, porphyrin 1 undergoes different types of packing driven by different noncovalent
interactions such as intermolecular H-bonding and porphyrin core stacking,
leading to different types of morphology of porphyrin 1 in an aqueous medium. The high crystallinity evidenced by XRDs shows
that the superstructures observed in SEM micrographs are composed
of nano and microcrystalline self-assemblies. Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) experiments were performed on the porphyrin 1 with
various equivalents of cytosine (2, 4, 8, and 12 equiv) to confirm
the size distribution of the assembled formation (Figure S10).

2.5 Proton NMR
The
assembly formation
upon addition of nucleobase C to the porphyrin 1 (4.39
× 10–3 M) was indicated by the shifting of
signals in the 1H NMR spectrum. With the addition of 1
equiv of C a marked upfield shift was observed for the aromatic proton
of porphyrin 1, moving from δ 8.35 to 8.24 ppm
with broadening (Figure 5). For the incremental addition of C (2 and 10 equiv), upfield shifts
of the aromatic proton signal to 8.15 and 8.03 ppm was observed, respectively.
After addition of 8 equiv of C, the aromatic proton of porphyrin showed
the appearance of a split proton peak at 8.02 and 7.99 ppm. In the
presence of 10 equiv of C the NMR peaks of the porphyrin aromatic
ring system appeared at 8.01 and 7.97 ppm. This particular signal
corresponds to payroll Hb of porphyrin 1,
indicating one recognition site of the molecule along with the phosphonate
group. These 1H NMR shifts of the proton peak indicate
that H-bonding has taken place between porphyrin 1 and
C via complementary molecular recognition sites. By observing all
of these results, we interpret that the self-assembly takes place
via intermolecular H-bonding, along with stacking of the porphyrin
core, with the different interaction modes depending upon the ratio
of C relative to the porphyrin 1.

the addition of various equivalents (1–12) of cytosine in D2O.

2.6 Schematic
Representation of Molecular Co-Assembly
Up to a 1:8 ratio
of porphyrin 1 to cytosine, the
acid–base interaction results in a low charge density on both
the weak acid and base molecular moieties, that is the phosphonic
acid moieties and the amine functional group of the cytosine in the
assembly, permitting the moderately hydrophobic core to self-assemble
face to face in the aqueous environment. This leaves the peripheral
phosphonate groups free to further grow in the porphyrin plane via
interaction with cytosine. It is well known that the porphyrin self-assembly
can result in multimeric ring structure antennas present in light
harvesting systems. Similarly, ring-shaped superstructures were obtained
at 1:8 and 1:10 porphyrin–cytosine ratios. The number of 1:8
complex porphyrin–cytosine subunits in such structures is dependent
on the type and size of the moieties substituted on the porphyrin
cores. Here, we have cytosine moieties extending the plane of the
porphyrin core to give nanocrystalline subunits assembling in the
ring shape, following the naturally occurring pattern at and around
1:8 porphyrin 1 to the cytosine ratio. Once this balance
is disturbed the self-assembly results in radial fractal growth composed
of crystalline blades (Figures 3 and S6a,c) and as graphically
illustrated in Figure 6. These results are similar to the self-assembly of extended bodipy-derived
π-conjugated systems,24 which is
a key player for nanoarchitectonics supramolecular materials.25

3 Conclusions
In summary,
the supramolecular self-assembly of octaphosphonate
tetraphenyl porphyrin 1 with three different nucleic
bases [adenine (A), cytosine (C), and thymine (Th)] was studied. Porphyrin 1 assembled with C (1, 2 and 4 equiv) to produce microflowers
and nanorods on a silicon wafer surface. The self-assembly of porphyrin 1 in the presence of 8/10 equiv of C yields well-defined ring-like
structures similar to natural light-harvesting antennae. Furthermore,
the co-assembled porphyrin with nucleobases A and Th exhibited prism
and microrod-like structures, respectively. The controlled porphyrin
ring-like supramolecular self-assembly formation opens up a new way
of creating porphyrin arrays, and this self-assembly approach could
be useful to construct artificial antenna similar to natural light-harvesting
systems by manipulating donor/acceptor subunits.
