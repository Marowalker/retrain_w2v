Donor−π
bridge–acceptor (D−π–A)
organic dyes, well studied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),
are found to possess great potential in light-inducing hydrogen evolution
due to their distinguished light-harvesting ability and suitable electron
energy level. In this work, multicarbazole-based organic dyes (2C,
3C, 4C) were used as photosensitizers of Pt/TiO2 for photocatalytic
hydrogen evolution (PHE) from water under visible light irradiation.
3C-Pt/TiO2 shows the best photocatalytic activity among
the three dye-sensitized photocatalysts, with a hydrogen evolution
rate of 24.7 μmol h–1 and a turnover number
of 247 h–1. The activity of 3C-Pt/TiO2 declines significantly after 3 h irradiation. The deactivation was
caused by the partial degradation of the electron acceptor, cyanoacrylate
moiety, during the photocatalytic process, which was evidenced by
UV–vis, Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), NMR, and
mass spectra. This work is expected to contribute toward the understanding
of stability issues of organic dyes and the development of more efficient
and steady dyes for hydrogen evolution from water splitting.

1 Introduction
Hydrogen,
with water as the only reaction product, when it combusts,
is an ideal candidate for the replacement of fossil fuels in the future.
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) through water splitting using
visible light is a promising method and is attracting much attention
recently.1−5 A great number of photocatalysts including TiO2 are used
to reduce water into hydrogen gas, while many of them suffer from
low photocatalytic activity because of low quantum yield, fast recombination
of photoinduced charge carriers, or poor absorption of visible light.6,7

As a strategy for expanding absorption spectrum, photosensitization
of TiO2 photoelectrode with dyes, which was originated
from the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) found by Graetzel,8 were reported to be efficient in promoting PHE.9−15 The dye molecules work as antennas to collect optical energy and
then inject electrons from the photoexcited dye into the conduction
band (CB) of semiconductor to achieve the enhanced photocatalytic
activity.

Most frequently used dyes for PHE are limited to noble
and rare
metal (e.g., Ru and Ir) complexes9,15−17 or halogenated xanthene,18−20 such as tetrabromofluorescein
(eosin Y) showing high PHE rate but rapid dehalogenation.11 Metal-free donor−π bridge–acceptor
(D−π–A) organic dyes, which are studied extensively
in DSSCs,21−23 have a profoundly higher extent of light-harvesting
capability than the metal complexes because of their special D−π–A
dipolar architectures.24,25 Under visible light irradiation,
intramolecular charge transfer from the donor core to acceptor end-group
occurs, and subsequently photogenerated electrons are injected into
the CB of TiO2. Several D−π–A organic
dyes including phenothiazine,26−30 triphenylamine,31−33 carbazole,25,34,35 indole,36 perylene,37 and coumarin38,39 units have been reported
for PHE. However, their hydrogen evolution rates are not high enough.
Moreover, a key problem is the instability and degradation of the
dyes taking place quite often during the photocatalytic processes.26,29,30,33 For example, the excited states of phenothiazine-based dyes are
decomposed through some chemical reactions.26,33 Obviously, degradation of dye sensitizers results in a decreased
activity and even cessation of hydrogen evolution with irradiation
time. Until now, very few studies have paid attention to the degradation
of dyes.28,29 We do not know what happens to dye sensitizers
during the photocatalytic reaction.

Here, we report three multicarbazole-based
organic dyes (2C, 3C,
4C, Figure 1) sensitized
Pt/TiO2 for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible
light irradiation. These dyes, formerly achieving relatively high
light-to-electricity conversion rates up to 6.8%,40 exhibit good PHE performances. Nevertheless, a decrease
in PHE activity was observed with light illumination. A possible photocatalytic
mechanism was inferred and the process of degradation of dyes was
also discussed. This work is expected to contribute toward the understanding
of stability issues of organic dyes and the development of more efficient
and steady dyes for hydrogen evolution from water splitting.

of three multicarbazole-based organic dyes.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Synthesis of Organic Dyes
The three
multicarbazole-based organic dyes (2C, 3C, 4C) were synthesized mainly
through the Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel reaction with carbazole
as the main starting material. The experimental details were depicted
in our previous work.40

2.2 Preparation of Pt/TiO2
A photoreduction
method reported in our previous work41 was
utilized to prepare platinized TiO2 nanoparticles (Pt/TiO2). In brief, TiO2 Degussa
P25 (1.00 g) was suspended in a solution of deionized water (100 mL)
and anhydrous ethanol (5 mL), and then H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (1.93 × 10–3 mol L–1, 13.5 mL) was added into it. After stirring for 0.5 h, the suspension
was illuminated with a 150 W high-pressure Hg lamp for 2 h. The precipitate
was filtered under reduced pressure, washed with water and ethanol,
and dried at 80 °C for 5 h to give Pt/TiO2 powers
with Pt loading of 0.5 wt %.

2.3 Preparation of Dyes@Pt/TiO2
For testing the interaction between dyes and Pt/TiO2 by
Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra and
Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), dye-sensitized Pt/TiO2 composites (dye@Pt/TiO2) were prepared. Typically,
to a 20 mL dimethylformamide (DMF) containing a certain amount of
dye, Pt/TiO2 powder (0.3 g) was added and continuously
stirred overnight at room temperature. Then, DMF was removed by filtration,
and the obtained solids were dried in an oven at 60 °C for 5
h. The final composites were labeled as 2C@Pt/TiO2, 3C@Pt/TiO2, and 4C@Pt/TiO2, respectively.

2.4 H2 Evolution Measurement
The three multicarbazole-based
organic dyes (2C, 3C, 4C) were used
as sensitizers for Pt/TiO2 to split water and produce H2 under visible light. Typically, in a Pyrex cell (190 mL)
with a flat window, Pt/TiO2 (0.1 g) was dispersed in dye–DMF
solutions (10 mL, 1.0–10.0 × 10–6 mol
L–1) and kept stirring for 30 min. Aqueous solution
containing 10 vol % triethanolamine (TEOA, 70 mL) previously neutralized
with HCl aqueous solution was added. The suspension was stirred in
an ultrasonic bath for 5 min and purged with N2 for 30
min to remove O2. Then, the Pyrex cell containing the suspension
was placed under an illumination of a 250 W high-pressure Hg lamp
with a cutoff filter at 420 nm. Sampling was conducted at each hour
through a septum on top of the Pyrex cell during experiments. The
amount of evolved hydrogen was quantified using a gas chromatograph
(TCD, 13X molecular sieve column, N2 gas carrier).

2.5 Measurement of Dyes Degradation
The
degradation of dyes in the H2 evolution measurement was
investigated by means of UV–vis spectra, FT-IR spectra, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and
mass spectra of the desorbed dyes after PHE for 8 h. For retrieving
the desorbed dyes, the suspension was filtered to gain colorless filtrates
and red particles. The latter was immersed in a mixture of 0.1 M aqueous
NaOH solution (10 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (10 mL) for 30 min.
After another filtration, the filtrates were acidified to pH = 4 with
HCl aqueous solution and extracted with CHCl3. The obtained
solution was dried and distilled under reduced pressure to give red
solids.

2.6 Characterization
FT-IR spectra were
recorded on an IR Prestige-21 instrument (Shimadzu, Japan) by the
transmission method using the KBr pellet technique. UV–vis
absorption spectra were collected with a UV-2550 spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu, Japan). UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS)
of the dye@Pt/TiO2 composites were obtained on a spectrophotometer
of U-3310 (Hitachi, Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere accessory
(BaSO4 was used as a reference). The liquid state 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on an AV 500
MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) with tetramethylsilane as the reference.
Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF MS) was performed on a Bruker autoflex III (Bruker, Germany).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 FT-IR
analysis
To elucidate the interaction
between dyes and Pt/TiO2, the FT-IR spectra of dyes and
dye@Pt/TiO2 were characterized as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 FT-IR spectra of (A)
dyes, (B) dye@Pt/TiO2, and Pt/TiO2 samples.

The 2C, 3C, and 4C have similar spectra with absorption
bands at
around 3046, 2958, 2930, 2871, 2213, 1585, 1482, 1363, 1139, 1077,
and 800 cm–1. The characteristic absorption bands
of the dye appear in dye@Pt/TiO2 but with reduced intensities,
demonstrating the presence of the dye in the dye@Pt/TiO2. Moreover, some characteristic absorption bands of the dye in the
dye@Pt/TiO2 shift remarkably, for example, the band at
1363 cm–1 (related to vibration of −COO–) in 3C shifts to 1380 cm–1 in 3C@Pt/TiO2,25 and the band at 1139 cm–1 (related to vibration of S–C in thiophene)
in 3C shifts to 1156 cm–1 in 3C@Pt/TiO2 (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information);42 this apparent blue shift implies that the 3C
molecule could be adsorbed onto Pt/TiO2 through the carboxyl
group (carboxylate coordination or/and ester-like bonding)31,43 and S atoms (coordination interaction with Ti≡ on the surface
of TiO2), and the large wavenumber shift demonstrates that
intensive chemical interaction occurs between them. These interactions
can be beneficial to electron transfer from the excited dye to Pt/TiO2, thereby enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

3.2 DRS Analysis
The DRS spectra of 3C@Pt/TiO2, 3C, Pt/TiO2, and TiO2 are shown in Figure 3. The pure TiO2 can only absorb UV light, while 3C and Pt/TiO2 have absorption both during UV and visible light ranges. In Pt/TiO2, a visible light absorption band is due to surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) effects of the Pt nanoparticle on the TiO2 surface.44 After being sensitized with
the dye, the 3C@Pt/TiO2 composite displays a broad absorption
over a wide spectral range from 400 to 650 nm, which is attributed
to the improved light-harvesting nature of the photocatalyst composites.
The 2C and 4C have very similar results (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information), and the DRS spectra suggest
that three dyes can effectively sensitize Pt/TiO2 in a
broad visible light region.

Figure 3 UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS)
of 3C@Pt/TiO2, 3C, Pt/TiO2, and TiO2.

3.3 Photocatalytic
Hydrogen Evolution
The reaction conditions were as follows:
0.10 g Pt/TiO2; 2.0 × 10–6 mol L–1 dye;
pH 7.0; triethanolamine as electron donor, visible light (λ>
420 nm) irradiation.

The three multicarbazole-based organic
dyes (2C, 3C, 4C) were evaluated as sensitizers for Pt/TiO2 to produce H2 under visible light using triethanolamine
as a sacrificial electron donor. Notably, DMF was used as a solvent
for each dye without being removed by filtration to prevent particle
agglomeration. For making a difference with dye@Pt/TiO2 prepared for FT-IR and DRS measurements, the photocatalytic systems
based on 2C, 3C, and 4C were named as 2C-Pt/TiO2, 3C-Pt/TiO2, and 4C-Pt/TiO2, respectively.

The photocatalytic
activity of hydrogen evolution of dye-Pt/TiO2 upon visible
light irradiation is presented in Figure 4. Hydrogen evolution was not
observed in the Pt/TiO2 or TiO2 system. All
of the three dye-Pt/TiO2 composites display remarkable
photocatalytic activity in the order of 3C-Pt/TiO2 >
4C-Pt/TiO2 > 2C-Pt/TiO2. 3C-Pt/TiO2 has the highest
rate of hydrogen evolution of 24.7 μmol h–1. The turnover number, which is defined as twice the ratio of the
amount of evolved hydrogen to the amount of dye in unit time, is 247
h–1. The rate of hydrogen evolution of the dye-Pt/TiO2 in our study is not high compared with other reports on the
dye-related H2 production with xenon lamp as a light source,
because the visible light source in this study is a 250 W high-pressure
mercury lamp, whose radiation intensity is low.

Figure 4 Photocatalytic hydrogen
evolution using dye@Pt/TiO2 catalysts.

Why does 3C shows the best photocatalytic activity as in our previous
study on DSSC?40 The probable reason is
that more twisted structures and alkyl side chains can inhibit dye
aggregation and charge recombination,40 and thus, the 3C shows better photocatalytic activity than 2C. However,
a further increase of carbazole units (dye 4C) does not increase its
photocatalytic property, which may be caused by loose packing by its
larger twisted structure and more n-butyl chains compared with 3C.
The loose packing leads to some voids through which TEOA+(the oxidized TEOA) could penetrate the dye layer and recombine with
an electron on Pt/TiO2.

The lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) levels of 2C, 3C,
and 4C are −1.42, −1.48, and −1.47 V (vs NHE),
respectively.40 The LUMO levels are much
more negative than that of the CB of TiO2 (∼ −0.5
V). Such a result indicates that electron injection from the excited
dyes into the CB of TiO2 was permitted thermodynamically.
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of 2C, 3C, and
4C are 0.99, 0.94, and 0.94 V (vs NHE), respectively,40 which are more positive than TEOA/TEOA+ reduction
potential value (0.82 V),45 implying that
TEOA in the reaction system could thermodynamically reduce the oxidized
dyes which are produced after electron injects into the CB of TiO2. A reaction mechanism of 3C-sensitized hydrogen evolution
is illustrated in Figure 5. When 3C-Pt/TiO2 composites are irradiated by
visible light, 3C can be excited by photons, and electrons in the
HOMO (located in multicarbazole and thiophene units) are promoted
to the LUMO (located in the cyanoacrylate moiety). The photoinduced
electrons in the LUMO can be easily injected into the CB of TiO2, and the injected electrons are immediately trapped by the
Pt on the surface of TiO2 and react with adsorbed H+ from H2O to produce H2.

Figure 5 Illustration of photocatalytic
hydrogen evolution using 3C-sensitized
Pt@TiO2 with TEOA as an electron donor.

The effect of concentration of the dye on the photocatalytic
hydrogen
evolution was investigated. As shown in Figure 6, the activity of Pt/TiO2 without
the dye upon visible light was not observed, while the hydrogen evolution
activity is enhanced distinctly when a low level of 3C is involved,
indicating that hydrogen evolution is induced by dye photosensitization.
The photocatalytic activities increase with increasing concentration
of dyes to show a maximum at a dye concentration of 2.0 × 10–6 mol L–1 and thereafter a decrease.
When 3C increases from 0 to 2.0 × 10–6 mol
L–1, the antenna effect of light harvesting is enhanced,
more excited dye is formed, and hydrogen evolution is improved. However,
when the dye concentration further increases (>2.0 × 10–6 mol L–1), all of the sites on the
surface of TiO2 have been adhered to by dye molecules and
no active sites
are available to be accommodated further; thus, the rate of hydrogen
evolution do not gain an enhancement and the activity is inversely
reduced due to deactivation of excited dye molecules from the agglomeration
effect. Although the TON was found to increase progressively when
decreasing the concentration of the dye, with a maximum value of 380
h–1 at a dye concentration of 1.0 × 10–6 mol L–1. This means that the dye
is more effective at a low concentration in hydrogen evolution; a
similar phenomenon was reported by other scholars.46

Figure 6 Effect of of dye 3C concentration on the photocatalytic activity
and TON. The reaction conditions are as in Figure 4 with the exception of dye concentration.

3.4 Discussion of Stability
Issue
The
stability of 3C-Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst during the photocatalytic
reaction was investigated. As in Figure 7, the time course of hydrogen evolution reveals
that the activity of 3C-Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst is relatively
high within 3 h of irradiation and then displays some declining trend.

Figure 7 Time course
of the hydrogen evolution using 3C@Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst.

The reaction conditions as in Figure 4.

To clarify the above
phenomenon, UV–Vis, FT-IR, 1H and 13C
NMR, and MS of original 3C and the residual
(3C-R) retrieved after the photocatalytic reaction were characterized.
As shown in Figure 8A, the UV–vis spectrum of 3C exhibits an UV absorption band
with center at ∼305 nm and a Vis absorption band with center
at ∼445 nm. The former is ascribed to the π–π*
transition of carbazole moieties and the latter is the intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT) transition from the HOMO (multicarbazole and
thiophene units) to the LUMO (cyanoacrylate moiety).40 For 3C-R, its UV absorption band has no significant change
while the Vis absorption band almost disappears, indicating that carbazole
units are unchanged but cyanoacrylate or/and thiophene unit may be
destroyed. The initial concentration of the dye had little effect
on UV–vis spectra of 3C-Rs (Figure S3 in the Supporting Material). In Figure 8B, 1H NMR spectra have little
difference, especially at 7–9 ppm, revealing that the multicarbazole
unit still remains after the photocatalytic reaction, and 13C NMR spectra also support this point (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). FT-IR spectra of Figure 8C displays that the
peaks of carboxyl group (−COOH, ∼1580 cm–1, νasy) and cyano group (−CN, ∼2210 cm–1) in the dye undergoing photocatalysis become weak dramatically,
and the peak related to thiophene (∼800 cm–1)42 has no obvious change. The result
suggests that the electron acceptor cyanoacrylate moiety in dye 3C
has been removed to a large part, so a decreased hydrogen evolution
was found in our study. To better understand the deactivation of 3C,
mass spectra are presented in Figure 8D. 3C-R presented a main peak at m/z = 856, 44 lower than 3C (m/z = 900), corresponding to decarboxylation, which can be
the cause of disappearance of the ICT absorption band in Figure 8A. The other two
peaks at m/z = 833 and 709 indicate
that further deterioration of cyano moiety and thiophene takes place.
Therefore, we suppose that the degradation of 3C during irradiation
probably proceeds in a route presented in Figure 9, which differs with that reported in ref (26).

Figure 8 (A) UV–vis absorption,
(B) 1H NMR, (C) FT-IR
spectra, and (D) mass spectra of the dye (a) before and (b) after
photocatalytic reaction. The peaks marked with asterisk and triangle
are attributed to DMSO and H2O, respectively.

Figure 9 Possible degradation route of 3C during photocatalytic hydrogen
evolution.

The carbazole group exhibits high
stability, which may be attributed
to the positive charge separation by N atoms when the electrons of
3C are injected into the CB of TiO2 and became an oxidation
state.28 Cyanoacrylate is the most vulnerable
moiety in molecular structure because of decarboxylation, a phenomenon
may proceed like in the synthesis of cinnamic acid using malonic acid
and benzaldehyde.

The above discussions on dye stability prove
that carbazole-based
D−π–A organic dyes with cyanoacrylate moiety as
electron acceptor is efficient for PHE, but not stable in aqueous
solution during the photochemical reaction. This conclusion inspires
us to develop new steady organic dyes with other electron acceptors
(such as oxosilane and phosphate group). Further studies are in progress.

4 Conclusions
Multicarbazole-based organic
dyes (2C, 3C, 4C) were developed as
photosensitizers for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water
under visible light irradiation. 3C shows the best photocatalytic
properties with a rate of H2 generation of 24.7 μmol
h–1 and the turnover number of 247 h–1. The activity of 3C@Pt/TiO2 declines significantly after
3 h irradiation, which is proved to be caused by the partial removal
of electron acceptor cyanoacrylate moiety from the dye molecule during
the photocatalytic process. This conclusion inspires us to develop
new steady organic dyes with other electron acceptors.
