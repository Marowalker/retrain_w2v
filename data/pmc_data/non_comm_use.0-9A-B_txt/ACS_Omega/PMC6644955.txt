Deep red light-emitting electrochemical
cells were prepared based
on a blend of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, a cationic complex,
and a neutral Zn(II)-complex based on diphenylcarbazone ligands, named
Zn(DPCO). The crystal structure of the Zn(DPCO)2 (bpy)]
molecule revealed that the DPCO ligand has been deprotonated to form
DPCO– and coordinated to the Zn center metal through
the C=O and N=N moieties of DPCO. From the cyclic voltammetry
results and controlled potential coulometry data of the diphenylcarbazide
(DPC) ligand, it is possible to establish that DPC is oxidized in
an irreversible process at +0.77 V, giving DPCO and later oxidized
at a higher potential (+1.32 V) to produce diphenylcarbadiazone (DPCDO).
A detailed assignment of UV–vis spectra futures to determine
the origin of ground- and excited-state transitions was achieved by
time-dependent density functional theory calculations, which showed
good agreement with the experimental results. Using a simple device
architecture, we obtained deep red electroluminescence (EL) with high
brightness (740 cd m–2) and luminous efficiency
of 0.39 cd/A at a low turn-on voltage of 2.5 V. The favorable configuration
of the cell consists of only a blend of complexes of indium tin oxide
as the anode electrode and molten alloy cathode (Ga/In) without any
polymer as the transporting layer. The comparison between [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and [Ru(bpy)3]2+/Zn(DPCO)
demonstrates a red shift in the EL wavelength from 625 to 700 nm in
the presence of Zn(DPCO), revealing the importance of using blends
for future systems.

1 Introduction
Organic
light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) were introduced for lowering
the costs, producing high-brightness emissions, and easily tuning
the color of electroluminescence (EL) through a variety of emitters.1 However, the fabrication of OLEDs simplifies
the sequential deposition of several layers, some of which consist
of instable interlayers and electrodes, implying a rigorous encapsulation
of the device and, thus, posing a great challenge for low-cost commercialization.
In the past decade, scientists proposed a single-layer light-emitting
device called light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEECs)2 that overcame some of the limitations of OLEDs.
LEECs generally consist of a single layer of ionic transition-metal
complexes (iTMCs) sandwiched between two electrodes. LEECs can also
include a bilayer device, with a thin layer of conductive polymer
such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)
located between the indium tin oxide (ITO) glass and the emitter in
order to improve the hole mobility and smooth the electrode surface.3 Because of the ionic nature in LEEC, which is
the fundamental condition to operate the device, a redistribution
of ions under an applied voltage allows the maintenance of a low turn-on
voltage (the typical voltage required to turn on the LEEC device)
without the use of injecting layers when the material’s ionic
conductivity is enough,4 resulting in a
very simple architecture that substantially reduces the cost of fabrication.
The highest brightness and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were
achieved for LEECs based on iTMCs (iTMC–LEECs) as the emitter
layer.5 As the first LEEC employing a polymer
in the ionic media was introduced in 1996,6 several studies have been carried out in order to enhance the performance
of the device.7 [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as a benchmark luminescent material attracts great interest
in both research and industry carriers because of its outstanding
photophysical and photochemical properties such as extremely long
excited-state lifetime (τ ≈ 1 μs), high photoluminescence
quantum yields (Φ ≈ 0.095) in solutions at room temperature,
and intense absorption band in the visible region.8 As an emitting layer and electron-transport material, aluminum
trisquinoline (AlQ3) was the first and most studied efficient
low-molecular-weight OLED material. It attracted considerable attention
because of its remarkable emission properties such as high brightness,
high EQE, and fine color-tuning.9 The quinoline
ligand of AlQ3 acts as a N^O-donor ligand that can be coordinated
to metals such as Al3+, Zn2+, or Pt2+. Here, we introduced a blend of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and a Zn(II) complex containing a π-extended derivate of quinoline
named diphenylcarbazone (DPCO) as the emitter layer in an LEEC for
the first time. Similar to the quinoline derivate, carbazides act
as N^O-donor ligands. DPCO has interesting properties such as easy
coordination to metal, a π-extended system, and pH sensitivity
that modulate the emission color. The application of a blend of an
organic polymer as the host material is an important method for obtaining
desirable EL behavior. Recently, a tris-chelated complex of Zn(II)
with a ligand of 2,2′-bipyridyl, [Zn(bpy)3]2+, was successfully employed as a promising additive to the
cyclometalated–iridium complex emitter to improve the LEEC
features.10 However, there is a gap in
the literature about the influence of blending two low-weight molecules
on the EL behavior of LEECs.

In this study, we focused on the
DPCO ligand and its correlation
with the benchmark tris(2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) complex
named [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and the blend of [Ru(bpy)3]2+/DPCO, highlighting the importance of EL in
a new class of the blend of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ emitter.

2 Results and Discussion
The complexes
were synthesized with an ca. 80% yield, substituting
the N^N of [Zn(N^N)x (DPCO)3–x] by the corresponding ancillary polypyridinic ligand
phen for Zn(LH1) and bpy for Zn(LH3), when x = 1
and its homoleptic complex (x = 0) for Zn(LH2) with
three DPCO moieties. The complexes were characterized by Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) (see Supporting Information, Figure S1). Two obvious important frequencies
around 1630 and 120 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectra of
the complexes can be assigned to (C=O) and (N=N) bands,
respectively, because of the coordination of ketonic oxygen and nitrogen
in the N=N group to the metal.11 Moreover, the 1H NMR spectra in a low-temperature condition
clearly showed the formation of complexes (Supporting Information, Figure S2). Characterization by CHN micro
analysis confirmed the successful synthesis of the complexes. In addition,
a single crystal of one complex, which was suitable for X-ray single-crystal
analysis, was analyzed to determine the accurate chemical structure
(Supporting Information, Tables S1 and
S2, and Figure S3). The challenge still remains for determining the
coordination modes of the keto–enol form of the DPCO ligand
and the number of metal-coordinated atoms. Some reports on the coordination
of monodentate and bidentate modes of N-amide and N^O were also reported.12 Here, the crystal structure indicated the coordination
of DPCO through the N^O mode to the metal (Figure 1). The structure of C36H30N10O2Zn, Zn(LH3) was a mononuclear six-coordinated
octahedral zinc(II) complex of the P21/c space group. The ZnII ion was coordinated
by one N atom and one O atom from every DPCO ligand, and two N atoms
from the 2,2-bipyridyl ligand. The Zn–O(1) and Zn–N(3)
bond distances were estimated to be 2.037(4) and 2.222(5) Å,
respectively, which are typical for most Zn–N^O complexes.
The bond distances of N(3)–N(4) and N(7)–N(8) equaled
1.281(7) and 1.273(7), respectively, indicating the double bond between
two N atoms, whereas N(5)–N(6) and N(9)–N(10) were,
respectively, 1.342(8) and 1.335(7), which could be assigned to the
single bond between two N atoms. Furthermore, the bond lengths of
1.286(7) and 1.288 (7) for O(1)–C(17) and O(2)–C(30),
respectively, indicated the formation of C=O. All these crystallographic
data confirm that the DPCO ligand was deprotonated to form DPCO, resulting
in Zn2+ in Zn(LH3). This evidence was proved from the difference
density map. An overview of the studies on the crystal structure of
the DPCO ligand and its complexes proved that there is no coordination
mode including N=N and C=O of diphenylcarbazide (DPC)
similar to Zn(LH1)–Zn (LH3).

of Zn(LH3). Thermal
ellipsoids are at the 30% probability level.

The UV–vis spectra of the ligand and complexes are
shown
in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. As previously reported in the literature,
DPCO has one absorption band in the visible region, which can be attributed
to the equilibrium of keto–enol forms.13 On the basis of Scheme 1, ligand DPC has four acidic hydrogens that can deprotonate
at different values of pH. Interestingly, the color of the solution
of DPCO changed from pale pink to dark cherry when increasing the
pH from 7 to 12, respectively (upper section of Figure 2). In pH levels above 12, there was no change
in the UV–vis spectrum. Moreover, the intensity of the maximum
absorption band in the visible region increased with increasing the
pH. These changes indicate the deprotonation of the N–H groups
in the basic medium.14 The UV–vis
spectra for the complexes are similar to those of the DPCO ligand,
along with a red shift of the maxima in the visible band and significantly
enhancing the molar extinction coefficient (ε) associated with
the coordination of DPCO to the metal.

through different pH levels is also shown in the upper section.

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures
of Zn(LH1)–Zn(LH3) Complexes
To explore the Ox/Red properties of the ligands and complexes,
we also performed an electrochemical analysis (Figure 4 and Supporting Information, Figure S4).

(ACN).
The employed electrodes and electrolyte including the working electrode
= platinum disc, counter electrode = platinum wire, reference electrode
= Ag/AgCl and the supporting electrolyte = tetrabutylammonium perchlorate
in ACN solutions (0.1 mol L–1).

A proved mechanism for the oxidation of DPC consists of two
steps:
first, DPC oxidizes to DPCO and then the oxidation of DPCO produces
DPCDO in the potential of around 0.83 (V) and 1.5 (V), respectively.15 In the reversed potential, the cathodic reduction
of oxidation products of DPC was formed because of the abstraction
of proton by triethylamine, which was observed in the form of one
peak of −0.3 versus Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE), corresponding
to the DPCO reduction to DPC. The Ox/Red behavior of complexes is
the same as that of the DPC ligand in the positive region except for
a shifting of about 0.4–0.5 V to lower potentials. Nevertheless,
some reduction processes appeared, indicating the influence of the
polypyridyl ancillary ligand in the reversed potential condition.
The π-conjugated system of the DPCO ligand allows for the easy
transfer of electrons, revealing the electrochemical activity of DPCO
(Supporting Information, Figure S5).

The half-wave of reduction of the complexes was relatively broad
compared to their ligands because of the overlapping of the half-waves
of ancillary ligands and DPCO. Because of the presence of assignable
absorption bands in the UV–vis spectra and Ox/Red half-waves
in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments of the DPCO ligand in Zn(LH1)–Zn(LH3)
complexes, the influence of the DPCO ligand on their different complexes
was investigated. Specific data are given in Table1. Controlled potential coulometry (CPC) was
carried out to calculate the number of electrons that are exchanged
during the Ox/Red process. To distinguish the origin of peak Ia (II) at the potential of 1.5 V, the applied
potential was kept in that potential for 1600 s in the solution in
varied amounts of DPC (Figure 5a). The number of moles of DPC has a linearity function with
the variation of charge in the solution media along with the correlation
coefficient of about 0.99, and the slope of the Q = f(t) formula is equal to t on F. According to the above explanation
and formula, 4.07 ± 0.05 of electrons was achieved for the oxidation
of DPC, which means that the DPC at the applied potential was probably
transformed to DPCDO through the equilibrium of 4e–, 4H+. CPC was also conducted to determine the products
in the reduction process of DPCO at the applied potential of −0.94
V for 1000 s by employing different amounts of the DPCO/DPC mixture
(40:60). Figure 5b
illustrates the family of curves obtained for these compounds. For
this reaction, the number of electrons is 1.97 ± 0.05, which
was obtained from the slope of the mentioned function, which equals nF.

Time-dependent
density functional theory calculation was employed
to obtain a new insight into the ground- and excited-state transitions
and subsequently simulated absorption spectra. The energy level along with the optimized structure
of Zn(LH1)–Zn(LH3) are depicted in Figure 6. The calculated Highest Occupied Molecular
Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) energies
of Zn(LH1) and Zn(LH3) complexes were −4.68 and −2.62
eV, whereas those of the Zn(LH2) complex equaled −4.56 and
−2.53 eV, respectively. The calculated HOMO–LUMO energy
gaps were the same for Zn(LH1) and Zn(LH3) complexes (2.06), whereas
it was 2.03 for Zn(LH2) (Supporting Information, Table S3).

Figure 6 Isosurfaces (isodensity contour = 0.03) for the HOMO and
the LUMO
of the complexes obtained from the DFT method through the B3LYP/LANL2DZ
basis set.

It can be observed that the HOMO
of the complexes has an amplitude
on the Zn center and the DPCO ligand, whereas LUMO is localized on
the DPCO ligand. The assignment of the calculated S0/T1 transition for these complexes is summarized in the Supporting Information, Table S4, and Figure 6 demonstrates their
Frontier orbitals involved in the main compositions of the S0/T1 transition.

For the Zn(LH1) complex, the T1
state originates mainly from HOMO
→ LUMO + 1, corresponding to electron promotion within DPCO
and from Zn to DPCO. The main conclusion of the Frontier orbitals’
analysis is that the contribution of DPCO ligands in complexes is
higher than that of another ligand, as a result contributing to electron
transitions (Supporting Information, Table
S4).16 Also, there is good agreement between
simulated UV–vis spectra obtained from time-dependent density
functional theory calculation and experimental data (Supporting Information, Figure S6).

As the structure
of the DPCO ligand is similar to Alq3 as the N^O donor
ligand, we performed the LEEC test with the configuration
of ITO/complex/Ga/In. The advantage of this configuration is its simplicity
for two reasons: first, using only a single active layer between two
electrodes without any polymer, even PEDOT:PSS; second, utilizing
low-melting-point alloy cathode contacts that have the potential for
LED production by printing and inject methods to escape vacuum evaporation
techniques.

Moreover, a blend of two metal complexes, [Ru(bpy)3][ClO4]2 and Zn(LH1–3), was employed
to achieve deep red EL emission. Different concentrations of the blend
were tested and characterized. The I–V–L characteristics of Zn(LH3) in
different W/W of [Ru(bpy)3][ClO4]2/Zn(DPCO) are summarized in Figure 7 and Table 2.

Regarding the
optimization of doping concentration, we found a
deep broad red EL for Zn(LH3) with 4/1 of W/W of [Ru(bpy)3]2+/Zn(DPCO) along with the high luminance of 740 cd/m2 and high luminous efficiency of 0.39 cd/A.16,17 These values are close to those obtained with other Zn(LH) complexes
in a variety of concentrations. Surprisingly, although the emission
intensity of the blend was relatively decreased with increasing the
amount of the Zn(LH) complex, the EL wavelength was significantly
red-shifted to the near-infrared region (Figure 8), achieving a deep red EL emission at approximately
700 nm with CIE coordinates of 0.710 and 0.280, regarding the EL wavelength
of 625 nm for [Ru(bpy)3][ClO4]2 with
CIE of 0.681 and 0.308 (white reference CIE(x, y) = (0.31; 0.33).12 Another
crucial point is that the applied turn-on voltage (Vturn-on) of the fabricated device is just 2.5 V,
which is the lowest value among the reported Vturn-on for deep red light electrochemical cells to
date.5,7,17−19 Under an applied bias, ClO4– counter
ion in [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexes drift, leading
to the accumulation of negative counter-ion and cationic Ru and Zn
complexes in close proximity to holes and electrons, respectively.20Figure 9 demonstrates the proposed schematic representation of charge
transfer in the fabricated LEEC. However, because a barrier energy
of approximately 1.5 eV is produced at the interface of [Ru(bpy)3]2+/Zn(DPCO) complexes, it is difficult for the
holes to be injected into Zn(DPCO) complexes. Therefore, holes (electrons)
will be blocked by Zn(DPCO) complexes and accumulate at the interface
of [Ru(bpy)3]2+/Zn(DPCO) complexes.

LEEC based on [Ru(bpy)3]2+–Zn(LH). The
movement of ions in the
single layer under an applied voltage allows for efficient charge
carrier injection from air-stable electrodes.

In both sides, near the [Ru(bpy)3]2+/Zn(DPCO)
complex interfaces, the electric field in the bulk is redistributed,
and the electric field in the [Ru(bpy)3]2+/Zn(DPCO)
layer moves higher than the one in the[Ru(bpy)3]2+ layer alone. This explanation is in good agreement with the observed
red-shifted and broadening EL, which is routinely seen in Electroplex
emission.21

As evidence to confirm
the Electroplex emission, the amount of
accumulated electrons and holes in the interface was gradually increased
with increasing the applied voltage, which was observed in our fabricated
LEEC cells as shown in Figure 10.

3 Conclusions
The X-ray crystal structure of the Zn(LH3) complex clearly indicated
a rare coordination mode of the DPCO ligand to a metal center including
the coordination of C=O and N=N of every DPCO ligand
to Zn. The electron density map also showed that the DPCO ligand has
been deprotonated and then coordinated to metal, confirmed by CV and
CPC. The blend of [Ru(bpy)3]2+/Zn(DPCO) complexes
confirms promising EL behavior when operated in a solid-state LEEC,
even with a simple air-stable cathode, reaching the high luminescence
of 740 cd·m–2 and luminous efficiency of 0.39
cd·A–1 at only 2.5 V. A red-shifted spectra
from 625 to 700 nm was achieved through the modification of the W/W
of blend compositions.

4 Experiments
We prepared
a new family of Zn complexes of general formula [Zn(DPCO)2(X)] (Scheme 1) where
X = bipyridine (bpy), phenanthroline (phen), and DPCO = diphenylcarbazone
as an N^O bidentate ligand with an extended aromatic system; fully
characterized; and utilized as a blend of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ emitter in the single-layer LEEC (Supporting Information, S1). The schematic structures of the complexes
Zn(LH1)–Zn(LH3) are shown in Scheme 1.
