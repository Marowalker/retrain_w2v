Existing
stereoselective routes to 2,5-cyclohexadienones involve
either desymmetrization of an achiral substrate or have attempted
to perform an asymmetric dearomatization of a phenol. Herein, we report
proof-of-principle experiments aimed at developing a kinetic resolution
as an alternative method for accessing enantioenriched 2,5-cyclohexadienones.
More specifically, chiral bifunctional thiourea catalysts were used
to promote the addition of 2-thionapthalene into unsymmetric para-quinols. The selectivity of the kinetic resolution
was found to be quite sensitive to substitution around the substrate.

Introduction
Cyclohexadienones continue
to serve as useful reactive intermediates
and building blocks for organic synthesis1,2 and
medicinal chemistry.3 Interest in these
compounds stems from their dense functionality and the fully substituted
carbon atom that is necessarily present. Over the past 10–15
years, there has been a steady interest in performing asymmetric transformations
involving 2,5-cyclohexadienones, and two main strategies have emerged
for realizing this goal. The first involves preparing an achiral dienone
(e.g., through iodine(III)-mediated oxidative dearomatization of a
symmetric phenol) and then performing a desymmetrization of the resulting
achiral dienone (Figure 1A).4,5 Numerous examples of dienone desymmetrization
have been reported and many afford products with high enantioenrichment.
A second strategy involves performing an asymmetric oxidative dearomatization
on an unsymmetric phenol (Figure 1B).6−8 This approach has the potential to be very powerful
as it provides direct access to enantioenriched, substituted dienones.
However, this route remains underdeveloped for several reasons.9,10 Although some progress has been made in accessing enantioenriched
2,5-cyclohexadienones in this manner,11 there is still no single chiral iodoarene catalyst capable of delivering
high selectivity with a wide range of substrates.

asymmetric transformations with 2,5-cyclohexadienones.
(A) Asymmetric desymmetrization of 2,5-cyclohexadienones. (B) Asymmetric
oxidative dearomatization to chiral 2,5-cyclohexadienones. (C) Kinetic
resolution of 2,5-cyclohexadienones (this work).

The strategies outlined in Figure 1A,B are both viable options for the preparation
of
enantioenriched products from a 2,5-cyclohexadienone. In some circumstances,
a desymmetrization route may be more efficient.12 In others, using a chiral dienone derivative would be a
better choice.13 With a multitude of desymmetrization
options available,4,5 the question then becomes, is
there another way to access chiral, nonracemic dienones without using
a chiral iodoarene catalyst? Owing to the ready availability of racemic
2,5-cyclohexadienones from substituted phenols, we hypothesized that
the development of a kinetic resolution approach might be such a solution
(Figure 1C). To the
best of our knowledge, 2,5-cyclohexadienones have not previously been
subjected to kinetic resolution reactions. Herein, we report our initial
proof-of-principle experiments in which a thiol-Michael reaction14−16 was used for the kinetic resolution of para-quinols.

Results
and Discussion
Our initial experiments focused on the resolution
of 2,4-dimethylquinol
(1a) using p-toluenethiol (p-TolSH) as a nucleophile (Scheme 1). Cinconidine was used as a catalyst for these experiments
as it is a readily available chiral base. The conversion was determined
from the enantiomeric excess of the product and recovered starting
material by using eq 1, which is a rearranged
form of one reported by Kagan and Fiaud.17 1  

Scheme 1 This method has previously been used to obtain
accurate conversions
in kinetic resolution reactions.18

In kinetic resolutions, the % ee of the product and unreacted starting
material is directly related to the overall conversion. For this reason,
it is more useful to compare the krel values
of different reactions, as these are directly related to the free
energy difference of the diastereomeric transition states (eq 2).19 2  

Assuming a given kinetic resolution is first-order or pseudo-first-order
in reactants, the calculated krel value
should be the same at all conversions irrespective of using the %
ee of the starting material or product. We calculated the krel values using the % ee, as measured by chiral
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), of recovered starting
material according to the following equation17 3  

A screen of several
solvents [CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CCl4, tetrahydrofuran (THF), Et2O,
PhCF3, toluene] revealed toluene provided the highest krel value. Performing the reaction at lower
temperatures (0, −50 °C) provided no significant improvement.
In all cases, the nucleophile was found to add only to the less-substituted
double bond of the dienone (to give 2),a owing to the electron-releasing nature of the methyl group
in the 2-position.20 Despite the low selectivity
afforded by cinconidine, these results were quite promising as we
were at least observing some kinetic discrimination of the two enantiomers.

In order to identify a more selective catalyst, we turned our attention
to bifunctional thiourea catalysts.21 We
also determined that replacing p-TolSH with 2-napthalenethiol
(2-napSH) led to somewhat improved selectivity. Consequently, we used
this nucleophile to screen different chiral thiourea catalysts (Scheme 2 and Table 1). As expected, thiourea catalysts 4a and 4b, which incorporate a basic amine, did
offer improved performance (entries 1 and 2). We also had the opportunity
to screen catalysts 4c and 4d in which the
amine was replaced with a diaryl phosphine group. We were surprised
to find that these catalysts offered somewhat improved performance
(entries 3 and 4) compared to 4b. The substitution of
the N-arylthiourea does have an influence on the
selectivity (entries 5–7). Eventually, we decided that catalyst 4h, although not completely ideal with respect to selectivity
(entry 8), was sufficient to carry out further studies.

Both catalyst classes generated a single diastereomer
of the product,
in which the thiol was added syn to the hydroxyl group.a This was assigned on the basis of coupling constant analysis
and comparison to a similar, known compound.15b The syn addition can be rationalized using the stereoelectronic
effects proposed by Paquette and co-workers.22 This result also indicates that conjugate addition of the phosphine
moiety in catalysts 4c–h to the electron-deficient
alkene is likely not part of the mechanistic pathway. We did not observe
any change in enantioselectivity over time, indicating that thiol
addition was irreversible under these conditions.

A number of
potential catalysts resulted in little-to-no conversion
of quinol 1a (Figure 2). These results are instructive with regard to the
mechanism and how the various reaction components interact with each
other. The failure of iminophosphorane 4i and phosphine
oxide 4j shows that phosphine plays a key role in the
reaction, likely as a base or hydrogen-bond acceptor. Potential catalysts 4k and 4l are less conformationally flexible
than catalysts 4c–4h, revealing that proper positioning
of the phosphine is critically important. At the same time, catalyst 4k is a triaryl phosphine and will likely be somewhat less
basic than diarylphosphines 4c–4h. At this time,
it is not clear why phosphine 4l gave poor conversion,
when amine 4b was a competent catalyst. The requirement
of having both a Lewis basic group and a hydrogen-bond donor is further
supported by the poor results observed with bis(thiourea) 4m and bis(sulfonamide) 4n.

Figure 2 Thiourea catalysts that
gave poor conversion.

As thiourea-based catalysts have a tendency to aggregate
in solution,23,24 we decided to investigate how
changing the concentration of the
reaction components affects the selectivity of the kinetic resolution.
This was done using catalyst 4d, prior to identifying
catalyst 4h as being superior. In these experiments (Table 2), different volumes
of solvent were used while holding the amount of catalyst and reactants
constant. As shown in entries 1–4, dilution of the reaction
components resulted in increasing krel values. Entries 4–6 show that modest gains in selectivity
can be achieved by using lower reaction temperatures.

Having settled
on catalyst 4h as our optimal catalyst,
we decided to reinvestigate the influence of solvent (Table 3, entries 1–6) and other
reaction conditions. On the basis of these results, it was clear that
trifluorotoluene was preferred relative to other aromatic solvents.
The performance difference between m-xylene (entry
5) and p-xylene (entry 4) suggests that the solvent
does indeed play a critical role in organizing the various reaction
components. Entries 6 and 7 show that lower catalyst concentration
is preferred, in agreement with our concentration studies. Running
the reaction at −20 °C (entry 8) did not have a significant
influence on selectivity. The catalyst was found to be insoluble at
lower temperatures. We also investigated the effect of using different
amounts of nucleophile on the selectivity (entries 8–10). All
three experiments gave similar krel values
based on % ee of product 3.

Finally,
we applied our optimized reaction conditions to other
substituted para-quinols, in order to understand
the influence of substrate structure (Figure 3). Moving the R1 group in 1 to the 3-position (1b) was detrimental to the
selectivity, showing that the 2-position plays a key role in allowing
the catalyst to distinguish the enantiomers of the starting material.
In contrast, the alkyl chain in the 2-position could be modified (1c, 1d) without affecting the selectivity. Catalyst 4h does not tolerate R2 groups larger than CH3 (1e–h). These groups may hinder the approach
of the nucleophile in such a way that rate differences between the
two enantiomers become more similar. Adding a methoxy group to the
3-position (1i) was also detrimental. In this case, the
carbonyl is a vinylogous ester, which may interact with the hydrogen-bonding
components of the catalyst differently than an enone. Finally, the
importance of the hydroxyl group was determined with substrates 1j–l, which all failed to react. These results suggest
that, in addition to the aforementioned stereoelectronic effects,22 delivery of the thiolate by the hydroxyl25 may be a contributing factor. Alternatively,
free rotation around the C4–O bond by these larger groups may
completely block the approach of the nucleophile from the stereoelectronically
preferred trajectory.

kinetic resolution.
The conversions were determined using eq 1. The krel values were
determined using eq 3.

Until the absolute configuration
of Michael addition product 3 or the unreacted starting
material is established,a it will be difficult
to develop a complete stereoselectivity
model for this resolution. However, two potential models can be proposed
(Figure 4) based on
our experimental observations. In model A, the phosphine
moiety serves as a base to deprotonate the thiol. The quinol substrate
can be activated by hydrogen bonding with the phosphonium group. Hydrogen
bonds between the thiourea and the quinol hydroxyl group will guide
the thiolate to the appropriate alkene for reaction. A similar model
has been identified during density functional theory calculations
of asymmetric thiol-Michael reactions involving chinchona alkaloid-based
ureas.26 However, phosphines are much weaker
Brønsted bases than amines.27 Consequently,
complete deprotonation of the thiol by the phosphine is unlikely,
though hydrogen bonding with the thiourea would increase the acidity
of the thiol. The question of phosphine basicity can be avoided with
model B, in which the thiol engages both the phosphine
and the hydroxyl group of the quinol in hydrogen bonding. In both
cases, binding of the opposite enantiomer of the quinol to the catalyst
will introduce steric clashes between the R1 group and
the catalyst framework. Both models explain (a) why phosphine oxide 4j was not a competent catalyst and (b) why substrates 1j–1l were not competent substrates.

of substrate structure on the kinetic resolution.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have performed regio- and
stereoselective thiol-Michael
reactions on substituted 2,5-cyclohexadienones. These experiments
serve as an important proof-of-principle demonstration that kinetic
resolutions of 2,5-cyclohexadienonees are possible. We have demonstrated
that these reactions can be quite sensitive to substrate effects.
Taken as a whole, we believe these results will prove useful for developing
more selective kinetic resolutions, with or without cyclohexadienone
substrates.
