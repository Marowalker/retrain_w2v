We
systematically characterized the perovskite-like oxides Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3 as the oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) catalysts. Compared with IrO2, universally
accepted as the current state-of-the-art OER catalyst, Ca2IrO4 showed an excellent OER catalytic activity in an
acidic environment, whereas CaIrO3 did not. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) spectra showed that the oxidation of iridium in
Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3 was slightly beyond
+4. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra illustrated
that the IrO6 octahedral geometric structure in Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3 showed differences.
The IrO6 octahedral is asymmetrically distorted and uniformly
compressed in Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3.
Therefore, we propose that the IrO6 octahedral distortion
plays an important role in the OER activities.

1 Introduction
Global concerns about
increasing energy demands have stimulated
extensive studies on the production of renewable energy sources and
energy storage, including processes such as water splitting, direct
solar, and rechargeable fuel cells.1−4 The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in
particular, is often a critical step in these energy production/storage
options. Although precious metal-based catalysts with high OER activities
(such as IrO2) facilitate the reaction, the sluggish kinetics
associated with O–H bond breaking and O=O bond formation
are critical challenges.5−8 Therefore, the exploration of the OER mechanism and
the design of active catalysts are the key steps to address the challenge.

The study in the non-noble-metal OER electrocatalyst has made a
great progress. Xie et al. utilized an amorphous Co-carbonate-hydroxide
nanowire array for efficient and durable OER in carbonate electrolytes.9 MnO2–CoP3 nanowires
array on Ti mesh, and a thin amorphous Ni carbonate layer on the Ni3N nanoarray supported on carbon cloth were also reported as
efficient OER catalysts.10,11 However, the practical
application of the non-noble-metal OER catalyst is limited by the
pH range of the reaction environment.

Perovskites are a large
family with a general formula ABO3, in which A is the alkali
metal and/or rare-earth metal and B is
a transition metal.12 Numerous research
groups have conducted studies of the perovskite for OER and found
interesting results. Matsumoto et al. have demonstrated that the OER
activity of a La1–xSrxFe1–yCoyO3 system would increase with increasing
amounts of x and y.13 Suntivich et al. reported that many perovskite samples
containing different transition metals correlated the applied potentials
at a specific current density to eg electrons.14 Zhu et al. suggested that the superior OER activity
of La1–xFeO3−δ compared to that of LaFeO3 is due to the increasing Fe4+ population through oxygen vacancies in La1–xFeO3−δ.15

However, perovskites are mostly utilized as catalysts
for OER in
an alkaline environment.16 Given that Ir4+ has been proven to be the active site of the OER catalyst
in an acidic environment, we, herein, attempt to design the perovskite-like
oxides, in which the transition metal is iridium. Thus, we put insights
into calcium iridium oxides, Ca2IrO4, and CaIrO3, which are the members of the perovskite family. They are
often prepared at conditions of high pressure and temperature. Niwa
et al. prepared the perovskite and postperovskite phases of CaIrO3 by a high-pressure synthesis method using a multianvil apparatus.17 Keawprak et al. pressed the powders into pellets
after mixing with a small amount of ethanol and calcined at 1273 to
1473 K in air.18 Ohgushi et al. mixed the
starting materials with the molar ratio CaO/IrO2 = 1.1:1
and heated them at 1 GPa and 1450 °C for 30 min.19

To simplify the synthesis process, we prepared Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3 by the hydrothermal
synthesis and sol–gel
method. Conclusively, Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3 can be prepared successfully by sol–gel method so
that the highly associated preparatory costs of other processes can
be minimized. In addition, the internal structures of Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3 have been analyzed to reveal
the reason, why these kinds of perovskites show an OER activity. The
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS) have been tested for getting insights into the electronic structure
and the surface chemical states of perovskites. We found that the
IrO6 octahedral coordination be the decisive factor of
the OER activity.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Hydrothermal Reaction
For preparing
the composition of Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3, CaCl2 at 180 mmol/L and IrCl3·3H2O at 56.7 mmol/L in variable stoichiometric amounts were mixed
into a 40 mL Teflon-lined pressure vessel with 10 mL of deionized
water and 5 mL of 0.5 M aqueous NaOH. The mixture was loaded into
an oven to heat the solution to 250 °C for 720 min; then, the
vessels were cooled naturally at room temperature. The precipitates
were suction filtered and washed with deionized water twice to remove
other unwanted ions. The remaining retentate on the filter was dried
to dehydration in an oven at 80 °C for 1 h. After filtration
and evaporation, the samples were transferred into crucibles and calcined
at 700 °C for 360 min.20 The annealing
step was required for converting the amorphous hydrothermal precipitate
to a fine crystalline product (Table 1).

CaIrO3	12.37	40.21	20.30	27.11	
Ca2IrO4	14.21	38.79	27.02	19.98	
2.2 Sol–Gel Method
First, CaCl2 and IrCl3 were mixed according
to the above mixing
ratio, and both of the samples were added into 8 mL of citric acid.
Then, they were transferred to the COD thermostatic heater heated
at 150 °C for 60 min. After cooling, they were transferred to
a beaker heated at 110 °C, which resulted in the state transition
from liquid to solid powder.21

Then,
the samples were transferred to crucibles and heated at 700 °C
for 360 min. After cooling, the samples were mixed with HCl under
an ultrasonic environment for 30 min. Finally, the samples were turned
into their final form after filtration and evaporation.

2.3 Characterization
The morphologies
of the catalysts were observed using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) equipped with a Nova Nano S. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was performed using a JEOL model 2100 LaB6 instrument, operating
at 200 kV. The specimens were dispersed ultrasonically in ethanol
and then deposited dropwise onto 3 mm lacey carbon grids supplied
by Agar.

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected
using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer operating with Cu Kα
radiation and equipped with a VÅNTEC-1 solid-state detector.
Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) was utilized to confirm the composition
using a TEAMApollo system. XPS was performed using a Thermo ESCALAB
250 system. The radiation used was monochromatized using Al Kα
radiation with a 650 μm spot size. The XAS data at the Ir LIII-edge of the samples, which were mixed with LiF to reach
50 mg, were recorded at room temperature in transmission mode using
ion chambers using the BL14W1 beam line of the Shanghai Synchrotron
Radiation Facility, China.

2.4 Electrochemistry
To fabricate electrodes,
a typical ink preparation was done as follows: 6 mg of the prepared
sample, 1.0 mL of isopropanol, and 0.5 mL of deionized water were
added. The entire mixture was homogenized by a high-power sonication
probe for 10 min. Fifteen microliters (15 μL) of the ink prepared
as described above was dispensed onto the titanium (Ti) plate and
heated in a muffle furnace for 10 min. The step above was repeated
5 times. This gave a catalyst loading of 0.20 mg/cm2 geometric
on the Ti plate. For each electrochemical experiment, a fresh electrode
with similar catalyst loading was fabricated in the same way. A conventional
three-electrode electrochemical cell was used for all the electrochemical
measurements. The working electrode was a thin layer of the catalyst
prepared on the Ti plate as described above; the reference electrode
was a saturated calomel electrode, and the counter electrode was a
Pt plate. The electrochemical experiments were all performed at room
temperature (25 °C).

3 Results
& Discussion
3.1 Structure and Morphology
The prepared
catalyst (Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3) samples
are analyzed by XRD measurements.

Given the XRD pattern of Ca2IrO4-hyd (see in Figure 1a), we can see six peaks of high intensity
at the position of 19°, 33°, 34°, 28°, 34.5°,
and 54°. These characteristic peaks correspond to Ca2IrO4 and IrO2, as reported in the literature.22,23 Because Ca2IrO4-hyd is prepared via hydrothermal
synthesis, we come to the conclusion that we can synthesize the mixture
of Ca2IrO4 and IrO2 instead of pure
Ca2IrO4 by this method.

Figure 1 (a) XRD pattern of Ca2IrO4 prepared via hydrothermal
reaction (Ca2IrO4-hyd), Ca2IrO4 prepared via sol–gel method (Ca2IrO4-sol-700), CaIrO3 prepared via sol–gel method
(CaIrO3-sol-700), and CaIrO3 prepared via new
sol–gel method (CaIrO3-sol-1200). (b) EDS for the
CaIrO3 and (c) Ca2IrO4 sample.

The second and third line shows
the XRD patterns of Ca2IrO4-sol-700 and CaIrO3-sol-700, respectively,
whose preparation method is by sol–gel method. The characteristic
peaks corresponding to IrO2 do not appear in the pattern
of Ca2IrO4-sol-700 but appear in that of CaIrO3-sol-700. This fact demonstrates that Ca2IrO4 can be synthesized via sol–gel method, whereas CaIrO3 cannot.

On the basis of the results above, we raise
the calcination temperature
from 700 to 1200 °C when other procedures remain the same. The
last line in Figure 1a illustrates the XRD pattern of CaIrO3-sol-1200. Obviously,
the low intensity of characteristic peaks of IrO2 elucidates
the purity of CaIrO3-sol-1200.

Given that the XRD
patterns of perovskites are similar, we use
EDS to have an insight into the chemical composition of Ca2IrO4-sol-700 and CaIrO3-sol-1200. The ratio
of the amount of calcium and iridium is 0.749 in CaIrO3-sol-1200 and 1.35 in Ca2IrO4-sol-700, depicting
that the latter is twice as the former. Therefore, Ca2IrO4-sol-700 and CaIrO3-sol-1200 can be confirmed to
be the pure Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3.

Figure 2a–d
shows SEM of calcium iridium oxides, which illustrated molar ratios
of Ir to Ca (RIr/Ca) dependence of the
crystal morphology. At RIr/Ca = 0.5, Ca2IrO4 had a granular microstructure with a grain
size of about 0.8 μm. At RIr/Ca =
1, elongated grains about 10 μm in length and 2 μm in
width were observed in the CaIrO3 bulk phase. This result
is consistent with the research of Keawprak et al.18 In their research work, TEM of CaIrO3 has also
been tested. They confirmed that the rodlike CaIrO3 crystal
grows in the [100] direction. The TEM of Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3 samples, showed in Figure 2e–h, illustrated that two types of
crystalline planes, respectively, exist in these samples, in which
(110) and (111) correspond to Ca2IrO4, and (022),
(020) correspond to CaIrO3. The crystalline planes found
in TEM patterns were consistent with those found in XRD patterns,
whereas the individual crystalline sizes were consistent with those
found in SEM patterns.

3.2 Electrochemical Studies
To determine
the OER activity of Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3, we coated the prepared catalyst samples on the surface of titanium
plates as the working electrode in the three-electrode system. The
polarization curve is shown in Figure 3a. The curve illustrates that the onset OER potential
of Ca2IrO4 is approximately 1.50 V. According
to the study of Bernicke et al., the theoretical potential of the
OER amounts to 1.23 V under standard conditions and the lowest onset
OER potential of IrO2 is 1.48 V.24 The discrepancy between the onset OER potential of IrO2 and Ca2IrO4 is 0.20 V, which is smaller than
being compared with 1.44 V.

Figure 3 (a) Polarization curve of Ca2IrO4-/IrO2-/CaIrO3-coated electrodes in
0.1 M HClO4 solution, (b) cyclic voltammograms (CV) of
the Ca2IrO4-coated electrode in 0.1 M HClO4 solution, and
(c) relationship of the anodic peak current Ip vs the scan rate ν.

Besides, we can see that the current density amounts to 22
mA/cm2 when the potential is 1.66 V. Under the same conditions,
the current density of IrO2 amounts to about 15 mA/cm2, which is significantly lower than that of Ca2IrO4.

Then, normalized CV curve with different scan
rates for Ca2IrO4 is shown in the Figure 3b. We can see that two obvious
pairs of reduction/oxidation
peaks are seen in the CV curve at about 0.80 and 1.20 V. As the scan
rate becomes faster, the difference between anodic and cathodic currents
increases. The position of redox peaks changes with the increasing
scan rate as well. The absolute value of anodic and cathodic currents
of every pair of redox peaks is not the same. This result is similar
to the CV curve of the IrO2 electrode, which is in accordance
with the result of Lee et al.25 To further
investigate the redox reaction, the relationship of the anodic peak
current Ip and the scan rate ν is
shown in Figure 3c.
The peak current varies linearly with scan rate, which is consistent
with a surface couple.26 We deduce that
capacitance charging current is not obvious in the scan range, the
redox peak at 0.80 V corresponds to the proton transfer and that 1.20
V corresponds to the Ir3+/Ir4+ couple.

The durability is another important factor to evaluate the performance
of OER catalysts. Therefore, we take the stability measurement of
the Ca2IrO4 catalyst at 1.6 V for 5 h, as shown
in the Figure 4a. During
the OER process, the normalized current slightly decreases because
of the subtle change on the electrode surface. As shown in Figure 4b,c, the catalyst
formed as islands separated by cracks is more evenly distributed after
the stability measurement.

Figure 4 (a) Chronoamperometric curves at the constant
potential 1.6 V vs
RHE and the SEM patterns of the Ca2IrO4 working
electrode surface (b) at the initial time and (c) after the stability
measurement.

In summary, the OER reaction
rate on the surface of the Ca2IrO4-coated electrode
is higher than that on the
surface of the IrO2-coated electrode in an acidic environment.
The onset OER potential of the Ca2IrO4- or IrO2-coated electrode is approximately equal. The chronoamperometric
experiment confirms that Ca2IrO4 remains stable
during the OER.

3.3 XPS Analysis
As
an additional assignment
of metal oxidation states, we measured XPS spectra for Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3 (see in Figure 5). The samples were sputter-coated with carbon,
and the spectra were calibrated with respect to C 1s at a binding
energy (BE) of 284.8 eV. The major feature peak locates at 284.4 eV;
therefore, the ΔEb value is 0.4 eV. In Figure 5, two peaks at Eb = 529.5 and 531.4 eV and
a weakly intense peak at Eb = 533.2 eV are identified in the spectra
of O 1s in both Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3. Literature analysis shows that the oxygen states in perovskite-like
systems are rather complex and ambiguous to interpret. However, the
O 1s peak at Eb = 529.3 eV may be assigned to the lattice oxygen O2–, and the peak at Eb = 531.2 eV is the characteristics
of oxygen vacancy, whereas the peak at the highest binding energy
is assigned to water molecules adsorbed on the surface.27,28 It illustrated that the perovskite with relatively lower proportion
of oxygen vacancy has a higher OER catalytic activity.

Figure 5 High-resolution XPS spectra
of (a) O 1s, (b) Ca 2p, and (c) Ir
4f in Ca2IrO4 and (d) O 1s, (e) Ca 2p, and (f)
Ir 4f in CaIrO3. The dashed lines show the binding energy
position of Ir 4f in IrO2.

Analysis of the photoelectron spectrum Ca 2p following the
O 1s
reveals the presence of Ca2+. In Figure 5, feature peaks at ∼345.6 and ∼349.1
eV correspond to Ca 2p3/2 and Ca 2p1/2, whereas
peaks at ∼346.7 and ∼350.2 eV correspond to satellite
peaks in line with the previous reported research work.29 In the Ir 4f region of Figure 5f, the 4f7/2 peak shows a major
feature at 62.8 eV and a smaller component at 64.1 eV. The former
may be attributed to the presence of Ir4+, as in IrO2, whereas the higher energy feature may indicate the presence
of some iridium oxidized beyond +4.30 In
the Ir 4f region of Figure 5c, the proportion of the peak at 64.1 eV increases, which
means the proportion of higher valance iridium increases. Therefore,
we get the result that there is no relationship between the iridium
valence state and the OER catalytic activity of perovskites.

3.4 XAS Spectroscopy and Related Analysis
Figure 6a shows Ir
LIII-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)
spectra of Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3 along
with the reference material IrO2. The Ir LIII-edge XANES primarily corresponds to an electron transition of 2p
→ 5d, which is allowed by dipole selection rules. The energy
of the adsorption edge has been proven extremely useful in determining
the oxidation state of oxides.31 With the
comparison of intensity in the so-called “white line region”,
we can see that the peak height of Ca2IrO4 is
more than that of IrO2, which means the probability of
the 5d electron orbital transition from the 2p electron orbit by X-ray
excitation in the inner electrons of the Ir element in Ca2IrO4 is more than that in iridium dioxide, and thus, the
former is less occupied by electrons than the latter. The photo energy
value of Ca2IrO4 corresponding to the maximum
of the intensity is bigger, which is attributed to the displacement
of absorption to the high-energy direction. The Ir 5d states in CaIrO3 can be seen very close to those in IrO2. These
results all support the conclusion that the oxidation state of the
Ir element in Ca2IrO4 is higher than that in
IrO2, which is consistent with the result acquired in XPS.
Because the Ir LIII-edges in these three samples are almost
overlapped, the second derivative (see in Figure 6b) gives the change in the oxidation state,
and the same conclusion is given. The higher valence of Ir promises
a shorter bond of Ir–O in Ca2IrO4 than
in IrO2.

Figure 6 For Ca2IrO4, CaIrO3,
and IrO2 compositions, (a) normalized Ir LIII-edge XANES
spectra, (b) second derivative of Ir LIII-edge XANES, and
(c) Fourier transforms of the k3-normalized
Ir LIII-edge EXAFS are shown; crystal structures of (d)
CaIrO3 and (e) Ca2IrO4. The dotted
rectangles are corresponded to different coordination bonds.

Fourier transforms of the k3-normalized
Ir LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
for Ca2IrO4 and IrO2 compositions
are shown in Figure 6c, and the k-range is 3–12.5 Å. The
first peak is mainly formed by the Ir–O bond from IrO6 coordination.6 As a result, it can be
clearly found that Ca2IrO4 has a smaller R value than IrO2, implying that the Ir–O
bond in Ca2IrO4 is a little bit shorter. The
Ir–O bonds in IrO2 are four long plane bonds of
1.998 Å and two short apical bonds of 1.96 Å, whereas three
different pairs of bonds in Ca2IrO4, whose lengths
are 2.01, 2.04, and 1.98 Å, give rise to a distorted octahedral
configuration.

The second peak arises mainly from Ir–Ir,
which corresponds
to the c axis length of 3.16 Å for IrO2. For Ca2IrO4, the Ir–Ir bond length
is 3.19 Å, which is obvious that the Ir–Ir distance of
Ca2IrO4 is almost the same as that of IrO2. It comes to the same conclusion that Ir–Ir peaks
correspond to similar resultant values. Therefore, we can deduce from
the XPS and XAS data that less electrons occupy the 5d states, and
the IrO6 octahedron is distorted further in Ca2IrO4.

Although CaIrO3 exhibits a Mott-insulating
behavior
by the charge gap ∼0.17 eV and Ca2IrO4 shows a semiconducting behavior, the OER activity of two perovskites
show a great difference.18,32 We speculate that the
IrO6 octahedral distortion may be the key origin of this
difference.

In CaIrO3, the IrO6 octahedron
has an obviously
compressed character (see in Figure 6d), in which the apical Ir–O bond length (1.94
Å) is smaller than the length of four Ir–O bonds in the
plane (2.07 Å). In Ca2IrO4, three pairs
of Ir–O bonds with different lengths (2.01, 2.04, and 1.98
Å), as shown in Figure 6e, clarifies the fact that the octahedral coordination is
intensively distorted, where the unequivalent bonds not only exist
in an apical direction, but also in the four planar Ir–O bonds.
The properties associated to Ir–O bonds in Ca2IrO4 present asymmetric and uneven distribution of charge density,
whereas it is symmetric and uniform in the case of CaIrO3 in their 4-coordination plane.

As the investigation of our
laboratory on the Cu-doped IrO2, the Cu replacement of
the Ir site in IrO2 gives
rise to a distortion of the IrO6 coordination due to a
strong Jahn-Teller effect of CuO6, and results in higher
OER activity compared with pure IrO2.6 Kx≈0.25IrO2 contains distorted IrO6 octahedron, which changes its
electronic structure, and thus exhibits a high OER activity.33 Reier et al. reported that Ir–Ni oxides
offer an excellent OER activity, and the O K-edge XANES also showed
the changes in electron distributions of Ir–O bonds.34

In summary, the enhancement in the OER
activity results from the
IrO6 coordination transformation. The Ca2IrO4 has a strong distorted IrO6 geometry because of
different Ir–O bond lengths, whereas the CaIrO3 gives
a D2h symmetry IrO6 octahedron. The distorted IrO6 octahedron promotes
the OER activity, whereas the symmetry one does not. Therefore, Ca2IrO4 exhibits an outstanding catalytic performance
in water splitting.

4 Conclusions
In our
current conducted research work, we provide a new method
synthesizing the Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3 at atmospheric pressure. In the electrochemical experiments, we
prove that the OER activity of Ca2IrO4 is higher
than that of IrO2 in 0.1 M HClO4, whereas CaIrO3 shows no OER activity. The XPS and XAS data show that a higher
valence of the Ir site in Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3. The distorted octahedral symmetry leads to a strong interaction
between Ir 5d states and oxygen intermediates. Therefore, we come
to the conclusion that the key factor affecting the OER activity of
the perovskite is the IrO6 octahedral distortion.
