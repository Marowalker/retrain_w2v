A high
band gap, two-dimensional (2D) twisted octagonal (TO-)C10 allotrope of carbon is proposed. This dynamically and mechanically
stable structure shows thermal stability up to 500 K and shows one
of the largest Young’s modulus of 306.4 GPa nm (close to graphene)
among 2D carbon derivatives. TO-C10 also possesses one
of the highest 2.94 eV (3.97 eV by HSE06) indirect band gap among
reported 2D allotropes of carbon. Owing to structural anisotropy with
respect to the basal plane and strong directional sp3 bonding,
the band gap of the structure is tuned with high strain endurance
along with variation in the band gap subject to applied direction
of strain. The nature of the band gap also changes between indirect
and direct on account of variation in the valence band states, dominantly
governed by carbon atoms in the less symmetrically bonded ladder sites.
Further, the band gap can be tuned with doping of Si and Ge and also
by forming one-directional nanoribbons. Owing to structural inhomogeneity
and inherent high band gap, the proposed 2D TO-C10 can
be a potential candidate for future applications.

Introduction
Carbon has a large
number of allotropes because of small ionic
radii, high electronegativity, wide oxidation range, ability to adopt
various hybridization states (sp, sp2, and sp3), mixed nature of bondings (ionic and covalent), and so forth. The
absence of band gap among most of the two-dimensional (2D) allotropes
of carbon is governed by energetically favored sp2 covalent
bonding and limits their applications. Other 2D materials including
transition-metal dichalcogenides and black phosphorous have band gap
mostly less than 2 eV which results in their inability to respond
photons with wavelength less than 620 nm (e.g., blue and UV) in light-emitting
diodes and photodetectors.1−3

Engineering of the electronic
structure of 2D materials has drawn
large interest, for example, opening of band gap of graphene, tuning
band gap of bulk Si or Ge from indirect to direct, and so forth.4−8 With the discovery of superconductivity and correlated-insulating
behavior shown by twisted bilayer graphene, the emphasis of multitude
dimensional efforts toward the problem has drawn considerable attention
despite having large complexities.9−11 Tuning the band gap
of graphene is achieved by perturbing through physical potentials
via applying electric fields to the bilayer,4,12,13 patterned hydrogen adsorption,5,14 superlattice with different allotropes,15 and interaction with the substrate.16,17 The challenges
for such processes includes, strong chemical bonding of hydrogen adsorption
or substrate interaction changes intrinsic properties of graphene
significantly, applying electric field or forming superlattices opens
band gap merely by ∼0.3–0.7 eV, and so forth. Contrary
to opening of band gap, stacking of layers mostly reduces band gap
due to interlayer coupling-induced lifting of the degeneracy of states
near Fermi.18,19 The usual way of varying the
band gap of a structure is by varying composition, doping, or defects,
but that may pose experimental challenges of synthesizing the 2D material
with maintaining composition and stoichiometry. On similar grounds,
the unary composition material has advantage over synthesis but holds
limitation of inherent electronic properties of the material. These
challenges are overcome by straintronics, wherein systematic application
of strain impetus a handle for engineering the band gap of the material.20 2D materials are reported to show interesting
properties subject to straintronics. The topologically protected states
of graphene near to the Fermi surface are reported to couple with
certain phonon modes that lead to phonon softening under biaxial strain.21 Strain is implicated by lattice mismatch with
the substrate, thermal expansion, mechanical loading, and so forth.22 Strain can significantly change the lattice
structure by distortion; hence, it can vary the electronic structure
significantly near to Fermi energy. Usually with application of strain,
the deep conduction band states near Fermi comparatively shifts to
lower energy than the lowest conduction band states; this causes change
in the nature of band gap between direct or indirect.23 In some cases similar to the present case, the variation
in the valence band is also authoritatively significant to decide
the nature of the band gap. On the structural front, a large anisotropy
of black phosphorous along with one of the highest carrier mobility
has led to highly anisotropic electrical, optical, thermal, and mechanical
properties. Because of this striking contrast from the traditional,
most of the well-documented 2D materials such as graphene, transition-metal
dichalcogenides, and so forth have drawn considerable interest in
black phosphorous and derivatives.24

The recent report of the 2D pentagonal form allotrope of carbon
has shown a large band gap of 2.21 eV (3.25 eV by HSE06) governed
by the combination of sp2- and sp3-bonded carbon
sites.25 Despite experimentally challenging
possibilities due to unusual pentagonal symmetry and mixed hybridization,
the scope of experimental realization of 2D carbon allotropes having
intrinsic band gap has opened up and hence they have become a great
matter of interest for applications. Although most of the experimentally
synthesized carbon is in the mixed hybridization form, the recent
attempt of achieving high fraction of the sp3-bonded carbon
content in the tetrahedral amorphous carbon is reported.26 However, controlling the particular hybridization
in a mixed-phase material presents challenges than synthesizing the
single phase.

The sp3-hybridized 3D allotropes of
carbon such as diamond
show a large band gap. It has been observed recently that surface-bonded
hydrogen-induced migration of sp3 hybridization can show
interlayer bonding between few-layered (up to 4 layer) graphene assemblies.27 Controlling the reaction dynamics of synthesis
of diamond has been well established, and diamond nucleation kinetic
barriers for phase transition from graphene are proposed to be lowered
because of defects or surface stabilization; hence, such assemblies
may provide carbon assemblies with band gap. In this direction, recently,
we have proposed free-standing few-layered thermomechanically robust
N-terminated assemblies of sp3-bonded carbon phases, providing
respective bulk-like electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties.28

It had been believed for a long time that
only hexagon is the basic
building block, and then pentagon was proposed.25 Recently, a higher co-ordination cluster assembly-based
route is reported to be useful to predict 2D structures of ZnO. This
fundamental method exploits the higher co-ordination behavior to the
most stable clusters from the bottom to top approach and uses them
as a building block to predict 2D monolayer structures.29 Using this approach, the thermally and mechanically
stable octagonal ZnO monolayer which consists of eight atom units
as a building block is proposed.29 Earlier
studies have also confirmed the possibility of octagonal geometries
in many structures. Because the IV, II–VI, and III–V
group elements usually share the structural similarities, it is logical
to exploit fundamentally the use of octagonal units as a building
block. In the similar line, 2D octagonal carbon is already predicted.30

With the informative platform of straintronics,
anisotropic 2D
material, octagonal carbon, and our previous work on sp3-bonded carbon phases, the present work is carried out with endeavor
of predicting the large band gap 2D allotrope of carbon. It has led
to theoretical prediction of the present sp3-bonded 2D
carbon allotrope having structural anisotropy with respect to the
basal plane. It has been subjected to band gap engineering with the
aid of strategic advantages of straintronics, doping, and one-dimensional
confinement.

Results and Discussion
Stability and Thermomechanical
Properties
In present
work, the twisted octagonal ring of carbon connected by two C atoms
(termed as C1 sites) on each side of the basal plane is
used to form the 2D structure, which is henceforth referred to as
the twisted octagonal carbon (TO-C10) structure. It has
two parallel twisted ladders (termed as C2 sites) along
the b parameter, connected in the basal plane by
alternate vacant sites and C atoms (termed as C1 sites).
The unit cell of TO-C10 contains 10 C atoms (2 at C1 sites and 8 at C2 sites), and the unit cell is
marked by dashed rectangles as seen in Figure 1a. This forms corner atom-sharing hexagon-type
geometry as seen along the xy-plane, while 4 above
and 4 below C atoms to the basal plane as seen along the z-axis with thickness h. The resultant TO-C10 has an orthorhombic lattice type with space group Pban (50). Structural information, including lattice parameters a, b, bond angles (A),
and layer thickness (h), along with band gap are
incorporated in Table 1. The average bond length of C1 to C2 atoms
is 1.57 Å, while among C2 atoms, it is in the range
of 1.58–1.59 Å. Usually, the energetical preference (cohesive
energy) of sp3-hybridized carbon allotropes, diamond (7.85
eV/atom), lonsdaleite (7.83 eV/atom), and so forth, is lower than
the sp2-bonded carbon allotropes, graphene (7.98 eV/atom),
graphite (7.99 eV/atom), and so forth.28 The calculated cohesive energy of sp3-hybridized TO-C10 is 6.23 eV/atom and is lower than that of 2D-mixed hybridized
(sp2 and sp3) penta-graphene (7.08 eV/atom)
or significantly lower than that of sp2-hybridized metallic
2D octagonal carbon (7.47 eV/atom). However, the kind of effort vested
toward identification of only sp3-hybridized 2D allotropes
of carbon is very less. The present work contributes toward the identification
of sp3-hybridized 2D carbon allotropes and thus formed
the TO-C10 structure which proposes candidacy for the material
with anisotropic properties and their applications.

The dynamical stability of the structure
is determined and resultant
dispersion profile is incorporated in Figure S3. It shows the absence of negative frequencies which reflects the
dynamical stability of TO-C10. The thermal stability is
investigated by ab initio molecular dynamics (AMD) calculations, wherein
the assembly is simulated at 500 K for 8 ps in a time step of 1 fs. Figure 2 shows the variation
of potential energy of the system with time, indicating thermodynamical
stability of TO-C10. The inset shows geometry of the final
structure (a) in xy-plane and (b) along z-axis view. Thus, the obtained final structure is found to be significantly
distorted; however, the basic skeleton of the structure remains the
same. This distorted structure quickly regains the original state
on relaxation and liberates 0.08 eV/atom energy.

2D TO-C10 at 500 K. The inset shows
(a) xy-plane and (b) z-axis view
of the final structure, while (c) shows the variation in system temperature
with time.

Strain-induced mechanical stability
of the TO-C10 plane
is investigated. Strain energy (ΔE) is defined
as the energy difference between the respective unstrained and strained
systems. TO-C10 is subjected to uniaxial (along a and b) and biaxial strain within a small
limit of ±5%, and the variation in ΔE is
mapped to applied strain in order to determine the elastic properties.
The parabolic region of ±5% strain is used to extract the elastic
constants by fitting second-order partial derivative of strain energy
with respect to strain.28 The strain is
enforced by changing the respective lattice constant, and then the
ions are relaxed with restricting the dimensions of the unit cell.
Calculated elastic constants C11, C22, C12, C66, Young’s modulus, and Poisson’s
ratio (v) of TO-C10 are 320.7, 293.0,
11.7, 154.5, and 306.5 GPa nm, and 0.04, respectively; the detailed
plot (Figure S6) along with relevant discussion
can be found in the Supporting Information. Young’s moduli are 320.2 and 292.6 GPa nm along C11 and C22 directions, respectively. The mechanical stability
of the structure is established by the virtue of Born–Huang
criteria.41 The calculated average Young’s
modulus is 306.5 GPa nm and is significantly larger than penta-graphene
(265 GPa nm) and comparatively close to that of graphene (338 GPa
nm) among 2D carbon allotropes.25,28 Strong sp3-hybridized structures govern the large Young’s modulus and
can in principle enhance further by reducing inbuilt strain with appropriate
engineering of the structure. In that direction, N is found to be a suitable candidate, and the resultant structure
is found to show substantially higher Young’s modulus, and
these results will be communicated separately.

Furthermore,
to investigate stability with respect to the layered
structure, a two-layer assembly
of the 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of TO-C10 containing
80 carbon atoms (40 atoms per plane) is relaxed with consideration
of van der Waals forces. The resultant structure shows (Figure 1a) two layers separated by
a 3.09 Å distance with no significant structural changes in the
individual layer.

The stability of the structure with respect
to defects is determined
by performing calculations using a 2 × 3 × 1 supercell containing
60 carbon atoms. The single vacancy created at the site of terminal
C atom (C2) is nonmagnetic and demands a supply of 3.77
eV energy for formation, while it reduces the band gap of the system
to 1.66 eV. The basal plane vacancy of the central single C atom (C1) shows 4.0 μB magnetic moment and requires
a supply of 12.12 eV energy to form. The vacancy at the C1 site shows spin-resolved band gaps of 1.16 and 2.05 eV and can be
further exploited for spintronic applications. Higher defect formation
energy again establishes the energetical stability of the TO-C10 structure. The sp3-bonded TO-C10 shows
0.72 eV larger band gap, and it is 0.24 Å thick along the z-direction than the pentagonal structure.25

Inspired by the stability, a bulk structure is formed
using TO-C10. It is a bi-tetrahedral structure, and more
details of the
structure can be found in the Supporting Information (Figures S1, S2, and Table S1). The thermal
stability of TO-C10bulk is investigated by AMD calculations. Figure 3 shows the variation of potential
energy with time up to 8 ps in steps of 1 fs at 1800 K. The inset
shows significantly distorted final structure along (a) xy view and (b) z-axis view; however, the basic skeleton
of the structure remains similar. It suggests that TO-C10bulk is thermally
stable up to 1800 K. The electronic structure of TO-C10bulk (Figures 4b and 5c) shows that it has a direct band gap of 2.07 eV. The higher
band gap of TO-C10 than its bulk form can be ascribed to
the larger structural flexibility and quantum confinement effect.
However, the high flexibility is unlikely to be the dominant factor
given the less Ec (Table 1) of the 2D form than TO-C10bulk. The lower limit of bond
angles of TO-C10bulk is shifted to 90° by virtue of the bi-tetrahedral structure
which comparatively reduces strain and increases energetically stability
than 2D TO-C10. The formation energy of TO-C10 with respect to the bulk counterpart (Ec difference) is 0.55 eV/atom and is slightly a higher side for exfoliation.
Also, TO-C10bulk has chemical bonding and considerable atomic rearrangements along
the c axis; hence, chemical exfoliation may be experimentally
difficult.

structure and (c) variation in the system temperature.

It has been reported
recently that Young’s modulus can show
the trend of variation with the density of the 2D material. However,
we argue that the correlation of the mechanical property is highly
dependent on hybridization of states in the material and only 2D materials
of carbon with particular hybridization, either sp2 or
sp3, can show such individual trends because of variation
in the strength of bonding.

Electronic Structure
The electronic
structure is investigated
using band structure and site-projected partial DOS (l-DOS). Figure 4a and Figure 5a shows the l-DOS and band
structure plots of pristine TO-C10, respectively. It clearly
shows qualitatively similar band structures. The states at the valence
band are sp3-hybridized states, while contribution of s
states of carbon is comparatively larger at the conduction band. The
relative contribution of s states of carbon increases for deep-level
states as well as moving higher in energy than the Fermi energy. This
is similar to other sp3-hybridized phases of carbon, for
example, diamond, lonsdaleite, and so forth.28 The principle difference is in reduction of the forbidden region
from 4.11 eV (for diamond) to the present case 2.94 eV.28 This reduction of ∼1 eV in the forbidden
region can be ascribed to the bonding in deformed tetrahedral geometry
of the TO-C10 structure, wherein the bond angles and lengths
are varied from 109.5°, 1.54 Å from the perfect tetrahedral
structure, to that as shown in Table 1. The atoms in the ladder region of TO-C10 (C2 sites) have maximum deformation relative to the tetrahedral
structure, and hence their states appear in the forbidden region causing
reduction in the band gap. This generates strain and decreases the
structural and thermal stability of the system. Figure 6 shows the band-decomposed partial charge
density of Fermi ± 2 states of the TO-C10 structure.
The Fermi and Fermi – 1 valence states show charge delocalization
around C2 sites (in the ladder region) along the b parameter, whereas, the absence of charge at C1 sites can be clearly observed. This supports the conclusions of
l-DOS analysis of C2 sites being responsible for reduction
in the band gap. Figure 5a depicts the band structure of TO-C10, while (b) shows
the same using a more accurate HSE06 functional. The landscape of
electronic states gets clearer with the use of band structure analysis
along with respective l-DOS plots. The band structure plots shows
a maximum of the valence band in the M–Γ path and gives rise to indirect band gap. On application of strain
along the b parameter, the conduction band states
near Fermi remains similar but the C2 atom-derived states
undergoes major transition and changes nature of the band gap from
indirect to direct as shown in subsequent section. All the bands along
the path of symmetry points X–M in
the Brillouin zone are doubly degenerate because of two-fold symmetry
rotation operation. Similar features are observed previously for penta-graphene,
penta-CN2, and so forth materials.25,42 Because of inherent rotational two-fold symmetry, 2D, doped, and
bulk form structures show doubly degenerate bands along the X–M path. The nearly flat valence band
during the Γ to X path suggests the
degeneracy of these states. This degeneracy increases with applied
strain along parameter b as a consequence of and
bringing more symmetry in the structure as discussed in the next section.

Figure 6 xy-plane (top) and along z-axis
(side) view of band-decomposed partial charge density plots of Fermi
± 2 bands of TO-C10.

The l-DOS plots of C1 and C2 site vacancy
defects are as shown in Figure 4c,d, respectively. In the case of C1 site vacancy,
each of the first neighbor atoms possesses sp3-hybridized
unsaturated states in the forbidden region which gives rise to 4 μB of magnetic moment. In the case of C2 vacancy,
owing to peculiar geometry of the structure, the first nearest-neighbor
atom forms the double bond in the basal plane and does not possess
dangling bonds as shown in Figure 1c. Hence, such vacancy does not contribute to the magnetic
moment and causes relatively higher stability. The two C atoms in
the ladder region forms the 4-coordinated single bonds, while the
C atoms in the basal plane form the double bond. However, the 4-coordinated
nearest-neighbor C atoms of this double bond spatially separate pz states of double-bonded C atoms and hinder
their electron localization (π bonds) and give rise to a finite
band gap of 1.66 eV as shown in Figure 4d. The thermomechanically stable structure of TO-C10 shows an indirect band gap of 2.94 eV, and this makes TO-C10 to be a large band gap and a large Young’s modulus
2D allotrope of carbon.

Strain-Induced Electronic Properties
Strain-induced
variation in the mechanical and electronic properties of TO-C10 is exploited because of inherent structural anisotropy with
respect to the basal plane. Figure 7 shows the variation in the strain energy and band
gap with applied uniaxial strain along lattice parameter a (ΔEa, Ega) and b (ΔEb, Egb), respectively.
Significant lattice parameter-dependent variation can be seen in strain
energy; however, variation in the band gap is more prominent. The
band gap decreases with increase in lattice strain along the a parameter, while it increases with compression of the
lattice parameter till −6% (3.03 eV) and then decreases with
further compression. On the contrary, applying uniaxial strain along
the b parameter results in first increase in the
band gap from 2.84 to 3.04 eV (at 4% strain) and then decreases gradually.
On compression of lattice parameter b, the band gap
decreases. The nearly linear behavior of decrease in the band gap
with application of strain, along the b parameter
larger than 4% and along the a parameter larger than
−6%, can be clearly seen and can be probed for the applications.
A similar feature is seen from −6 to 11% of applied strain
along the a parameter, but the variation in the band
gap is small. The band gap vanishes at +25 and −18% of applied
uniaxial strain along the a parameter and at −12
and +20% of applied strain along the b parameter.
The opposite trend of band gap variation for both the lattice parameters
at lower values of strain is because of the peculiar geometrical flexibility
of the TO-C10 structure. Stretching (compression) of lattice
parameter b (a) leads to relaxing
of bond lengths in the direction of tetragonal symmetry bonding and
hence increases the band gap. However, this increase in the band gap
due to relaxation of one lattice parameter generates strain in the
other in-plane lattice parameter. The strain enforced along lattice
parameter a can endure larger values due to higher
capability of stretching of bond lengths of C1 carbon (basal
plane carbon) atoms. Higher ability to elongate more in the zigzag
direction is known in graphene or like materials because of the ability
to suppress bond elongation by adjusting bond angles. Despite having
a zigzag nature, the strain enforced along the b parameter
endures less stretching because of bonds of C2 (terminal
carbon along z-axis) atoms with the basal plane C1 site atoms. This behavior is the artifact of the large deviation
of asymmetric bond angles of C2 carbon atoms than the diamond-like
sp3 hybridized structure, and it results in decreased band
gap than diamond (4.11 eV)28 as evident
by l-DOS and partial charge density analysis.

Figure 7 Variation of strain energy
(ΔE) and band
gap (Eg), both in eV with applied strain
(in %) on TO-C10. The superscript denotes the lattice parameter
which is subjected to uniaxial strain. The nature of the band gap
(plotted with dotted lines) changes from indirect to direct on application
of strain greater than 4% (−6%) along the b (a) parameter, wherein positions are marked by
dashed vertical lines.

Although the band gap diminishes at larger values of strains,
the
occurrence of mechanical failure because of Kohn anomaly-induced phonon
instability at lower values of strain is well known.21,43 In the present case, soft phonons appear at an applied uniaxial
strain of +18% along a and −10 and +14% along
the b parameter. For the biaxial strain, the soft
phonons appear at +13% of applied strain. The negative strain is not
sustained by TO-C10 when subjected along the a parameter and equibiaxis and applying as small as −3% strain
leads to phonon instability caused by the acoustic mode of vibrations
along the out-of-plane direction. It is clear that apart from along
the b parameter, applying negative strain (contraction)
is dynamically not favored by TO-C10. Also, applying negative
strain is experimentally not a feasible idea because it may lead to
wrinkles and other physical deformations in 2D materials; hence, positive
strain is focused in further studies. The negative strain and biaxial
strain are plotted in Figures S7 and S8, the details of which can be found in the Supporting Information. Respective band structures and phonon dispersion
curves at 17 and 18% subjected to a and 13 and 14%
subjected to strain along b parameters are shown
in Figure 8. It shows
the soft phonons at the γ point on application of 18% strain
along the a parameter, whereas the applied strain
of 14% along the b parameter leads to soft phonons
at the K point, which is similar to that of graphene.21 Applying strain along the b parameter more than 4% and compression of the a parameter more than 6% leads to change in the nature of band gap
from indirect to direct. This is because of shifting of p states of C2 atoms at a higher level in the valence band
with respective strains. Interestingly, the variation in the band
gap of the structure on enforcement of strain is observed to induce
large variation in the valence band, whereas the variation in the
conduction band is comparatively less. Application of large uniaxial
strain along the b parameter and biaxial strain leads
to symmetry-driven increase in the degeneracy of states near Fermi
energy conduction and valence bands. The detailed analysis has shown
that the large variation in the band gap and other electronic properties
are primarily governed by strain-driven variation in the bonding of
C2 atoms. This can be primarily indulged by application
of biaxial strain and uniaxial strain along the b parameter. The important bond lengths are C1 with C2 atoms ()
and two types of bond lengths for C2 with C2 atoms, that is, in the x–y plane () and along the z axis
(). On application of 17% strain along the a parameter, these bond lengths are 1.80, 1.59, and 1.58
Å, whereas on application of strain of −7% along the a parameter (1.51, 1.58, and 1.58 Å) or greater than
5% along the b parameter (1.58, 1.66, and 1.55 Å),
the bonding shows comparatively more symmetric bond lengths (, , and ), respectively. However, this leads to
a large variation in the bond angles from 74 to 133° and that
causes the instability in the system.

Figure 8 Effect of strain on the electronic [(a)
through (d)] and phonon
[(e) through (h)] band structure of TO-C10 at 17 and 18%
along the a parameter and 13 and 14% of applied uniaxial
strain along the b parameter, respectively.

The observed variation in the
conduction band with applied uniaxial
strain is exploited further for electron affinity (EA) properties
by addition of a single electron to the strained TO-C10, which is reflected by varying EA. The EA of the system is defined
as the difference of total energy of the system without and with addition
of a single electron. The TO-C10 structure shows EA to
be of value −0.27 eV. This value of EA on application of uniaxial
strain in the range of −9 to +18% is found to vary from 0.37
to −0.42 eV in the case of strain along the a parameter and 0.66 to −0.32 eV in the case of strain along
the b parameter, respectively. These observations
in EA can be of potential interest in the field of field emission
and other electronic applications. It is incorporated in Figure S9 along with details, which can be found
in the Supporting Information. Because
the prime interest of the present work is on electronic band gap engineering,
more attention is paid on the electronic structure further by doping
and size confinement.

One-Dimensional Confinement and Doping
The variation
of band gap subject to structural confinement along one dimension
is known for carbon 2D allotropes and is always been a matter of interest
for applications. Figure 9 shows laterally 1 (a,b) and 2 (d,e) unit cell wide 1D structures
of TO-C10 which are shown along the xy-plane and z-axis views, respectively. The structural
relaxation in the case of 1 unit cell wide system leads to only corner
sharing C1 atoms in the basal plane to be of four-coordinated,
while rest of the atom forms linear double bonds with the nearest
neighbors. The bond length of the double-bonded atom shortens to 1.3
Å and in the case of four coordinated sites (C1 atoms),
it is 1.47 Å which is considerably shorter 1.57–1.59 Å
than that of the pristine structure. Double bonds of the structure
diminishes the band gap as shown in l-DOS plots in Figure 9c,f. In the case of the 2 unit
cell wide system, the TO-C10 geometry tries to retain but
undergoes stretching of bond lengths. The doubly bonded carbon atoms
at the edge (bond lengths ≈ 1.33 Å) shortens the 2 unit
cell wide region (bond lengths ≈ 1.47 Å), and this results
in stretching of bond lengths (bond lengths ≈ 1.81 Å)
in the 1 unit cell wide central region of the geometry. The basal
plane atoms along confined dimension form the double bonds; however,
the near-neighbor singly bonded C atoms hinder the π bondings
of these double bonds and open up the forbidden region by 0.87 eV
as shown in Figure 9f. Both of the confined systems are nonmagnetic, and their electronic
and structural properties are greatly influenced by the confinement
effect.

Figure 9 x–y plane and side (along z-axis) view of one-dimensional, one (a,b), and two (d,e)
unit cell broader ribbons of TO-C10 and respective site-projected
partial DOS plots (c,f). Fermi energy is adjusted to 0 for respective
plots.

Apart from strain-dependent variation,
the band gap of TO-C10 can be further tuned by doping.
We have investigated several
materials with substitutional doping, and among them, doping of Si
and Ge at the basal plane C1 site has shown dynamical stability.
The respective structures (Figure S1) along
with phonon dispersion graphs (Figure S3) can be found in the Supporting Information. On account of larger ionic radii, the lattice parameter a (x-direction) increases, while respective
angles (A) and stability of 2D assembly decrease
with increase in the dopant atomic number. This decrease in the stability
of the structure is reflected by respective cohesive energies (EcSi = 5.78 eV and EcGe = 5.39 eV), wherein higher Es of Si suggests that it is energetically more favorable
than doping of Ge. The site-projected DOS plots of Si and Ge doping
are incorporated in Figure S5 and can be
found in the Supporting Information along
with relevant details. On doping of Si, the structure shows a band
gap of 2.26 eV. This decrease in the band gap is principally due to
appearance of hybridized p states of Si with carbon at the top of
the valence band. These p states of Si are highly directional and
on bond formation with C atoms, these states undergo deformed orientation
than the pristine as reflected by the change in the structural parameters.
The entire landscape of the electronic structure is seen to be more
discrete on account of the dominant confinement effect. The thermal
stability is also reduced on Si doping in TO-C10 to 400
K. The variation in potential energy with time is plotted in Figure S4, and it can be found along with respective
details in the Supporting Information.
On doping of Ge, the band gap is reduced to 0.65 eV, and states around
the Fermi level are dominantly governed by s and p states of the dopant.
The bonding in the case of Ge-doped TO-C10 is different
as reflected by increased contribution from s states of Ge (Figure S5), and it does not show thermal stability
even at room temperature.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, a new 2D TO-C10 carbon allotrope [space
group Pban (50)] is proposed. It is dynamically and
mechanically stable with thermal stability upto 500 K. Owing to only
sp3-hybridized strong bonding, it shows one of the largest
indirect 2.93 eV (3.97 eV by HSE06) band gaps among the 2D allotropes
of carbon reported till date. TO-C10 has directional Young’s
modulus because of structural anisotropy with respect to the basal
plane, and it is of the value 320.2 GPa nm along C11 and
292.6 GPa nm along C22 directions. The average Young’s
modulus is 306.5 GPa nm, and to the best of our knowledge, it is one
of the highest reported Young’s modulus among 2D carbon allotropes,
close to that of graphene. The stability with respect to defects is
investigated, and higher defect formation energy and structural integrity
with respect to stacking of layers establishes again the stability
of the structure. The proposed bulk structure of TO-C10 contains bi-tetrahedral geometry, and it is thermally stable up
to 1800 K. It is a nonmagnetic material with a band gap of 2.07 eV.

The states of TO-C10, governed by comparatively less
symmetric C2 site atoms (ladder region) than the ideal
structure (diamond), are at the top of the valence band and decreases
the band gap of the structure with having an indirect nature because
of appearance of maximum of the valence band in between the M and Γ path. These delocalized states are principally
responsible for the strain-engineered mechanical and electronic structure
properties. The two-fold symmetry of the structure governs the doubly
degenerate states along the X–M path
for 2D and 3D TO-C10 structures. Also, it causes large
degeneracy of states around Fermi energy from the Γ to X path on the application of a larger value of strain along
the a parameter and biaxial strain. Application of
larger than +4% (−6%) positive (negative) strain along the a (b) parameter changes the valence states
significantly because of structural deformation toward a relatively
more symmetric structure and also converts to direct nature of the
band gap because of the shifting of valence states at the Γ
point. Similarly for biaxial strain, the changeover to direct nature
of the band gap appears after +8% of applied strain. The appearance
of soft phonons because of Kohn anomaly and hence degrading dynamical
instability is observed at 18, 14, and 12% of applied uniaxial strain
along a, b, and applied biaxial
strain, respectively. The interaction of phonon acoustic modes of
out-of-plane vibrations with these ladder region carbon atom states
principally causes the dynamical instability. The structure is dynamically
not susceptible to the application of negative strain (compression)
subjected to the a parameter and biaxial strain,
but the zigzag nature of the material along the b parameter leads to ability to endure negative strain in the same
direction up to −10%. Application of uniaxial strain is also
found to influence EA of the TO-C10, and it can be tuned
from 0.66 to −0.42 eV.

The one-dimensional confined ribbons
of TO-C10 shows
increase in the band gap with lateral size. For one unit wide layer,
the band gap diminishes because of double bonds of C atoms at edges,
while for the double unit cell wide layer, the 0.87 eV band gap appears
because of hindering of π electrons of doubly bonded C atoms
by near-neighbor singly bonded sp3-hybridized C atoms.
The discrete nature of the states reflects the large confinement effect;
however, the bulk stabilization as reflected by geometry is starting
to appear even as small as a two unit cell wide ribbon. The band gap
of the system is also tuned with the dynamically stable substitutional
doping of Si and Ge at C1 sites. The Si doping shows thermal
stability up to 400 K, while Ge doping does not show thermal stability
even at room temperature. The 2.26 eV direct band gap appears on doping
of Si and reduces significantly to 0.65 eV on doping of Ge at the
expense of reduced stability. The directional p states of Si, and
s and p states of Ge, principally govern the states around Fermi energy
and cause observed decrease in band gap because of inherent strain
in the structure induced by their larger atomic radii.

Owing
to strong sp3-hybridized bonding and anisotropic
structure, TO-C10 shows versatile directional variation
in the strain-induced mechanical and electronic properties and hence
is proposed to be the potential candidate for future applications.

Computational
Methodology
Density functional theory-based spin-polarized
electronic structure
calculations31,32 are performed using the accurate
plane-augmented wave method33 as implemented
in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).34−37 The Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof
exchange–correlation energy functional within GGA38,39 is employed. The plane wave basis cutoff value of 400 eV is used.
The cutoff values for total energy and convergence of forces on a
single atom of 10–4 eV and 0.01 (eV/Å), respectively
are used. To avoid interaction between images, a vacuum of 20 Å
is maintained along the z-direction. The 7 ×
11 × 1 k⃗ mesh generated by the Monkhorst–Pack
scheme is used for unit cell calculations and then scaled appropriately.
A 2 × 3 × 1 supercell containing 60 carbon atoms is used
to investigate dynamical stability by performing phonon calculations
using VASP, within the framework of density functional perturbation
theory, and using the PHONOPY code interface.40 AMD calculations are performed to investigate thermal stability
of the structure using VASP. For that, the Nosé–Hoover
thermostat is used and canonical ensemble calculations at single k point are performed on the 3 × 3 × 1 supercell
(containing 90 carbon atoms) in the case of the 2D structure, while
the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell (containing 80 carbon atoms) is
used in the case of bulk TO-C10 (TO-C10bulk) systems. Mechanical stability
is investigated by the finite distortion method, the details of which
can be found elsewhere.28 The cohesive
energy (Ec) of the system is defined as
follows: Ec = EC – ECn/n, where the total energy of the system containing n number of C atoms is denoted by ECn, and EC is the energy of the isolated single carbon atom. The single
vacancy defect formation energy is defined as follows: EDFE = EC + ECn–1 – ECn, where ECn–1 is the
energy of system with vacancy.
