The
conversion of abundant renewable cellulose into versatile formic
acid (FA) is a potential process for efficient energy storage and
application. Vanadium(V)-catalyzed oxidation with O2 in
acidic aqueous media now is the most common method to realize the
FA production from cellulose with both high yields and high purity.
However, vanadium-based catalysts are difficult to synthesize and
expensive. Thus, the seeking for cheaper catalysts with the same high
efficiency is expected. In this work, after testing a variety of metal
salts in acidic aqueous solution for the conversion of cellulose under
O2, iron(III) was found as a cheaper and readily available
catalyst for FA formation, with a comparable yield (51.2%, based on
carbon) with that of vanadium(V). The effect of reaction parameters
was studied. The competition between oxidation and hydrolysis was
found and discussed in detail. FeCl3 and H2SO4 can accelerate oxidation and hydrolysis, respectively, whereas
suppress the other. The effects can reflect on the product distribution.
Intermediates were found and the pathway from cellulose to products
was reasonably proposed. The reusability of the catalytic system shows
good performance after four runs. The mechanism study suggests a catalytic
ability by a mutual transformation between iron(III) and iron(II),
where iron(III) oxidizes substrates to iron(II) that is reoxidized
by O2.

1 Introduction
Conversion
of biomass into chemicals has drawn much attention as
a potentially alternative methodology for a sustainable strategy.1,2 In view of avoiding the competition with food, the feedstock comes
to nonfood lignocellulosic materials. Among lignocelluloses, cellulose
is the most abundant resource, thus leading to extensive studies.
Formic acid (FA) is an important chemical used widely in traditional
industries.3 In recent years, FA is considered
as a potential high-performance material in the fields of hydrogen
storage4−6 and fuel cell.7−9 Therefore, it is significant to
realize an efficient conversion of cellulose to FA.

Wet air
oxidation has long been regarded as an effective degradation
method of organic wastes, by which CO2, water, and small
molecular carboxylic acids are the main products. Jin et al.10 employed this method to conduct the cellulose
oxidation (using H2O2 as the oxidant) at a much
shorter reaction time (just few minutes) and higher pH (using alkali).
FA was formed in considerable yield (75%) as the formate form. However,
the harsh conditions (high temperature, high pressure, and excess
alkali consumption) limit further application. Thereafter, a series
of vanadium(V) catalysts were found to be very selective on aerobic
oxidation of cellulose to FA in a much milder conditions without alkali
consumption. Wasserscheid et al.11−14 and Fu et al.15 developed a vanadium(V)-containing heteropoly acid (H5PV2Mo10O40)-catalyzed oxidation
of cellulose to generate FA yields from 19% to 35% without any other
liquid byproducts. Then, a series of vanadium(V)-contained heteropoly
acids with different vanadium atom numbers were synthesized. Liu et
al.16 employed H4PVMo11O40 and PVMo11O404–-based ionic liquids for cellulose oxidation, and the maximum FA
yield can reach 49.7%. Wang et al.17 and
Wu et al.18−21 used much simpler vanadium(V) catalysts, VOSO4 and NaVO3, to improve the FA yield to 39% or higher. However, vanadium-based
catalysts are difficult to synthesize and are expensive.

In
all vanadium(V) systems, the observation of mutual transformation
between vanadium(V) and vanadium(IV) suggests a process in which the
substrate is first oxidized by vanadium(V) and reduced vanadium(IV)
is then oxidized by O2. This fact indicates that other
metal salt catalysts with (1) changeable valence and (2) lower reduction
potential than O2 can also catalyze cellulose oxidation
to form FA similar to vanadium(V) catalysts. Thus, in the present
work, we have tested several high valence metal salts with the requirements
of the above two as catalysts of cellulose oxidation, and have found
iron(III) is a high-efficiency catalyst to catalyze the generation
of FA from cellulose aerobic oxidation with both excellent yield and
excellent reusability. Compared with vanadium(V), iron(III) is easy
to obtain and synthesize, and has a low cast, which is suitable for
application. The relationship between oxidation and hydrolysis in
this iron(III)-catalyzed cellulose conversion, together with the transformation
pathway, was studied in detail. The exchange between iron(III) and
iron(II) was found to be the main transformation form of the catalyst.

and nitrogen (N2, 99.999%) were supplied by Beijing Haipu

grade and used without further purification.

2.2 Conversion
of Substrates
A series
of aqueous solutions with various metal salts and H2SO4 were prepared before the conversion. A certain amount of
metal salt was dissolved into distilled water with ultrasonic heating
and then mixed with a certain amount of diluted H2SO4. The mixed solution was fixed to a constant volume with distilled
water.

The conversion was carried out in a 25 cm3 batch reactor of Hastelloy alloy (HC 276) with a magnetic stirrer.
In a typical procedure, a certain amount of substrate, and 6.0 cm3 of prepared aqueous solution were loaded into the reactor.
Then, the reactor was sealed and purged with O2. After
that, O2 was charged into the reactor to a desired pressure.
Next, the reactor was put into a heating furnace with a heating rate
of 8–10 °C/min and stirred at a speed of 1000 rpm. The
pressure and the temperature of the reactor were measured by using
a pressure transducer with an uncertainty of ±0.025 MPa and a
thermocouple with an uncertainty of ±0.5 °C, respectively.
When the desired reaction temperature was reached (∼15 min
after being put into the furnace), the reaction time was recorded.
After the reaction, the reactor was quenched by using cold water.
When the reactor reached room temperature, the gas was released and
the liquid mixture was filtered. The residue was washed with distilled
water and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h before further use.
The liquid sample and gas sample were analyzed as follows.

2.3 Analysis of Products
The liquid sample
was analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatography (Waters 2695,
USA) with a Shodex SH 1011 column (Shodex, Japan). A diode array detector
(Waters 2998, USA) was employed to analyze the furan compounds (HMF
and furfural). A differential refractive index detector (Waters 4110,
USA) was employed to analyze other products. The column oven temperature
was 55 °C, and the mobile phase was diluted H2SO4 aqueous solution with a concentration of 0.01 mol/dm3 and a flow rate of 0.5 cm3/min. The gas sample
was detected using a GC (Agilent 7890A) using a TCD detector (200
°C) with a Porapak Q column (230 °C), with helium as the
carrier gas (40 cm3/min). The detected CO2 in
the gas phase was quantified by a total organic carbon analyzer (TOC-L
CPN, Shimadzu, Japan) after absorption in NaOH aqueous solution. All
the yields of products were calculated on a carbon base. The conversion
of cellulose was calculated by the difference in solid weight before
and after the reaction. We performed three-time parallel experiments
at each set of conditions, and the results reported herein represent
the mean values. The reproducibility of yields of FA and acetic acid
(AA) was estimated better than an average relative deviation of 3.6%.

Surface morphology of residues after conversion of cellulose was
studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Supra 55) with
an accelerating voltage of 20 kV.

The humin yield was calculated
as follows: humin yield = cellulose
conversion – yield of the detectable products – yield
of CO2.

2.4 Recycle and Reuse of the
Catalytic System
After completion of the conversion, the
solid was separated by
filtration. The liquid products were extracted by n-butanone with the same volume (for three times). Then, the n-butanone dissolved in the liquid was swept by N2 at 50 °C. Water was added to the recovered liquid system to
fit the original volume before the next run.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Screening of Catalysts
At the beginning
of the study, we tested various metal salts for the cellulose conversion
in H2SO4 aqueous solution under O2. The results are shown in Figure 1. The conversion of cellulose exhibits no significant
difference, whether the metal salts were used or not (nearly every
experiment provides a cellulose conversion >90%). In the absence
of
any metal salt, an FA yield of 26.4% was formed. When the metal salt
was added to the reaction mixture, the FA yield was generally increased.
This indicates that metal salts can change the product selectivity
but cannot significantly catalyze the degradation of cellulose. Among
these selected metal salts, two ferric salts, FeCl3 and
Fe2(SO4)3 showed the best performance
for giving the highest FA yield (48.3% and 47.8%, respectively). CuCl2 showed a lower FA yield (40.8%) after the ferric salts, followed
by AlCl3 (35.7%), MoCl5 (32.2%), CaCl2 (31.9%), CrCl3 (30.9%), and MgCl2 (27.3%).
Therefore, we employed the highly efficient ferric salt, FeCl3, as the catalyst for cellulose oxidation in further investigation.

3.2 Conversion of Cellulose in FeCl3–H2SO4 Aqueous Solution
3.2.1 Effect
of FeCl3 Concentration
on the Conversion
The effect of FeCl3 concentration
on cellulose conversion and products yields is shown in Figure 2a. The cellulose conversion
was not changed obviously and maintained at the range of 93–96%
when the FeCl3 concentration was increased from 0 to 0.1
wt %. The FA yield was increased from 26.4 to 48.3% when the FeCl3 concentration was increased from 0 to 0.0466 wt %. When the
FeCl3 concentration was further increased, the FA yield
showed a slight decrease (45–48%), probably because of the
accelerating decomposition of FA under higher FeCl3 concentration
(Figure S1a). Besides FA, AA and glycolic
acid (GA) were formed as the main byproducts in liquid mixture. Both
yields of the two acids were <4.5%. It is worth noting that, even
the yields were low, the decrease of both GA yield and AA yield started
when relatively low FeCl3 addition (0.0233 wt %) was added.
Especially, the AA yield was decreased in the whole range of FeCl3 concentration employed in this series of experiments. The
reason for the decrease in the AA yield is discussed later in section 3.3.

(a) FeCl3 concentration and (b) H2SO4 concentration on cellulose conversion and products
yields. Reaction conditions for (a): cellulose, 0.100 g; H2SO4, 2.0 wt %; H2O, 6.0 cm3; O2, 3 MPa; temperature, 160 °C; time, 80 min. Reaction
conditions for (b): cellulose, 0.100 g; FeCl3, 0.0466 wt
%; H2O, 6.0 cm3; O2, 3.0 MPa; temperature,
160 °C; time, 80 min.

3.2.2 Effect of H2SO4 Concentration
on the Conversion
The effect of H2SO4 concentration on cellulose conversion and products yields is shown
in Figure 2b. The cellulose
conversion was increased from 18 to 100%, when H2SO4 concentration was increased from 0 to 2.5 wt %. The increase
of cellulose conversion is due to the enhancement of the acidic hydrolysis
in H2SO4 solution (hydrolysis of cellulose in
H2SO4 solution was accelerated rapidly by the
increase of H2SO4 concentration, as shown in Figure S2). The FA yield was also increased (from
8 to 48.3%) with increasing H2SO4 concentration,
probably because soluble carbohydrates derived from cellulose by hydrolysis
were generated faster as the substrate in higher H2SO4 concentrations. The yields of GA and AA both were increased
with increasing H2SO4 concentration.

3.2.3 Effect of Temperature and Reaction Time
on the Conversion
The effect of reaction temperature on the
transformation of cellulose at different reaction times was studied.
As shown in Figure 3a, at a low temperature of 150 °C, the cellulose conversion
was low (43%) after 40 min. The conversion was only increased to 74%
after 140 min. When the temperature was increased, the cellulose conversion
was dramatically increased (the conversion was completed in 5 min
at 180 °C).

Figure 3 Effects of reaction temperature (a) on cellulose conversion
and
(b) on FA yield at different reaction times. Reaction conditions:
cellulose, 0.100 g; FeCl3, 0.0466 wt %; H2SO4, 2.0 wt %; H2O, 6.0 cm3; O2, 3.0 MPa.

The effect of temperature
on the FA yield shows a similar trend
(Figure 3b). High temperature
leads to quick formation of FA. For instance, a yield of 51.2% can
be obtained at 170 °C for 50 min and a yield of 51.2% at 180
°C for 7 min. The byproduct is only CO2 on the basis
of results of GC and TOC analyses of gas and liquid products. With
a prolonged reaction time at higher temperatures (170 and 180 °C),
a decrease of FA yield was observed. This decrease of FA can be explained
by the instability of FA in high temperature under oxidative conditions
(Figure S1b).

3.3 Oxidation
and Hydrolysis in Cellulose Transformation
in the FeCl3–H2SO4 System
with O2
The transformation of cellulose in FeCl3–H2SO4 aqueous solution with
O2 contains, apparently, two types of reactions, hydrolysis
and oxidation. Both two reactions occur under the same conditions,
and reaction parameters variation affects the rates of both reactions
with different extents at the same time. Combination of hydrolysis
and oxidation with different rates can probably lead to different
product distributions. Therefore, we tried to investigate the relationship
between various reactions (mainly hydrolysis and oxidation) by studying
the effects of reaction parameters on product distributions.

3.3.1 Competition on FA Selectivity
The
effect of FeCl3 concentration on FA selectivity is shown
in Figure 4a. Compared
with the reaction without FeCl3, FA selectivity was sharply
increased in the presence of only slight amount of FeCl3. A change of FeCl3 concentration from 0.0699 to 0.0938
wt % exhibits a slight decrease in FA selectivity, possibly due to
the instability of FA (discussed in Section 3.2.1). Together with almost unchanged cellulose
conversion under different FeCl3 concentrations (Figure 2a), one conclusion
can be drawn that FeCl3 shows no activity on cellulose
degradation, but catalyzes FA formation from the oxidation from soluble
carbohydrates generated from cellulose hydrolysis.

Figure 4 Dependence of FA selectivity
on FeCl3 concentration
and H2SO4 concentration is shown in (a,b), respectively.
The dependence of AA selectivity on FeCl3 concentration
and H2SO4 concentration is shown in (a,b), respectively.
Reaction conditions for (a,c): cellulose, 0.100 g; H2SO4, 2.0 wt %; H2O, 6.0 cm3; O2, 3.0 MPa; temperature, 160 °C; time, 80 min. Reaction conditions
for (b,d): cellulose, 0.100 g; FeCl3, 0.0466 wt %; H2O, 6.0 cm3; O2, 3.00 MPa; temperature,
160 °C; time, 80 min.

The effect of H2SO4 concentration on
FA selectivity
is shown in Figure 4b. Unlike FeCl3, FA selectivity did not change much when
H2SO4 was added. This independence of FA selectivity
on H2SO4 concentration indicates that H2SO4 only catalyzes hydrolysis of cellulose (Figure S2) but does not involve closely in the
oxidation for FA production. The selectivity decreasing at higher
H2SO4 concentration suggests the instability
of FA (Figure S1c).

3.3.2 Competition on AA Selectivity
The
effect of FeCl3 concentration on AA selectivity is shown
in Figure 4c. The AA
selectivity, contrary to the FA selectivity, was decreased with increasing
FeCl3 concentration. AA was proposed to be the main product
of oxidation of levulinic acid (hydrolysis product of cellulose),
evidenced by ∼50% yield of AA obtained from the conversion
of levulinic acid. It suggests that there is a competition between
oxidation (to form FA) and side reaction (probably hydrolysis, to
form byproducts such as AA).

Similarly, the effect of H2SO4 concentration on AA selectivity was contrary
to that on FA selectivity. AA selectivity was increased with increasing
H2SO4 concentration (Figure 4d), which differs from the independence of
H2SO4 concentration on the FA yield (Figure 4b). These results
prove further that the side reaction, mainly hydrolysis, shows a competition
relationship with the oxidation to FA.

3.3.3 Competition
on Humin Formation
As we know, stronger acidic condition
always leads to a larger extent
of humin formation. Humin is a mixture of substances with unknown
structures usually generated under acidic conditions via complicated
reactions among hydrolysis products.22 In
the absence of FeCl3, humin was largely formed even with
O2 (see Figure S3). When 0.0233
wt% FeCl3 was added, humin yield was sharply decreased
to 1.4%. Further additions of FeCl3 all show very limited
formation of humin acid. This result provided further evidence for
the suppression of FeCl3 on deep hydrolysis.

3.3.4 Competition on Residue Agglomeration
We have observed
that the residues after the conversion under different
conditions exhibit different morphology. This difference is illustrated
as SEM images of the residues under different H2SO4 concentrations in Figure 5. The unconverted cellulose appears as powder with
the size <100 μm (Figure 5a). After cellulose was converted in FeCl3 aqueous solution with O2 (no H2SO4), the residue size was approximately the same as the original cellulose
(Figure 5b). It displays
a “peeling” degradation of cellulose in FeCl3-catalyzed oxidation. Interestingly, after H2SO4 was added, even though the cellulose conversion was increased, the
size of the residue became markedly larger (Figure 5c). Higher H2SO4 concentration
leads to the residue with larger size (Figure 5d–f). The change of residue size is
presumably due to the cellulose agglomeration, which is caused by
the reaction of hydrolysis products (possibly HMF and furfural) and
unreacted cellulose. Therefore, it is another evidence for suppression
of FeCl3 on hydrolysis.

under different H2SO4 concentrations. (a) Untreated
cellulose; (b) 0; (c)
0.5; (d) 1.0; (e) 1.5; (f) 2.0 wt %. Reaction conditions: cellulose,
0.100 g; FeCl3, 0.0466 wt %; H2O, 6.0 cm3; O2, 3.0 MPa; temperature, 160 °C; time,
80 min.

3.4 Pathway
of the Cellulose Conversion in the
FeCl3–H2SO4 System
In order to further investigate the pathway of cellulose conversion
in FeCl3–H2SO4 aqueous solution
with O2 as the oxidant, we attempted to detect the intermediates
by the 13C NMR technique. Under acidic conditions, cellulose
was supposed to be hydrolyzed to generate water-soluble glucose for
further reactions. Therefore, 13C NMR detection of the
mixture after conversion of glucose was carried out (shown in Figure S4). The 12 signals at 61.0, 61.2, 70.0,
70.1, 71.8, 71.9, 73.2, 74.6, 76.2, 76.3, 92.5, and 96.3 ppm were
assigned to the six carbon in d-glucose (existing in water
as α and β anomers). The signals for FA (166.2 ppm), AA
(21.0 and 176.8 ppm), and GA (59.9 and 176.6 ppm) were also found
in the spectrum.

Additional information was obtained as other
signals appeared. The signals at 61.5, 67.4, 70.8, 71.3, 72.8, 94.2,
and 94.6 ppm were attributed to carbons of d-mannose in α
and β conformations (other signals overlapped with those of d-glucose). These results mean that epimerization of d-glucose to d-mannose occurs in FeCl3–H2SO4 aqueous solution. Besides, the signals at 28.3,
29.3, 38.2, and 177.2 ppm appeared, representing levulinic acid. The
detection of levulinic acid further confirms the hydrolysis occurs
in FeCl3–H2SO4 system, as
discussed in Section 3.3.

Afterward, these observable intermediates were selected
as model
compounds for conversion (conducted in milder condition, see entry
1–3, Table 1). d-Glucose and d-mannose were both converted
into high yields of FA with byproducts GA and AA formation. By contrast,
levulinic acid yielded limited FA (9.6%, entry 3, Table 1), but gave a large amount of
AA (49.7%). It indicates that levulinic acid may be the source of
AA in the conversion of cellulose. This view is in accordance with
the conclusion drawn in Section 3.3 that AA was derived from hydrolysis products.

The transformation of d-glucose can possibly
start with
a retro-aldol condensation, by which C3–C4 bond cleavage proceeds
to form d-glyceraldehyde and 1,3-dihydroxyacetone.23 Therefore, the latter two substances can also
possibly be the intermediates. The conversion of d-glyceraldehyde
yielded FA in high selectivity with nearly no byproducts in the liquid
phase (120 °C, detected in 13C NMR in Figure S5a). The conversion of d-glyceraldehyde
at a higher temperature in which cellulose was converted (170 °C)
produced a high yield of FA (51.7%, entry 4, Table 1) with AA and GA formation. The conversion
of 1,3-dihydroxyacetone was slower and produced FA, AA, GA, and glycolaldehyde
(120 °C, detected in 13C NMR in Figure S5b), although conversion of it at 170 °C produced
a slightly lower yield of FA (49.5%) with AA and GA formation (entry
5, Table 1).

As conversion of 1,3-dihydroxyacetone produced glycolaldehyde,
we tested glycolaldehyde for conversion. A much higher yield of FA
(66.2%, entry 6, Table 1) was obtained with considerable GA formation (15.0%). AA was derived
from 1,3-dihydroxyacetone probably via a dehydration product of 1,3-dihydroxyacetone,
methylglyoxal.23−25 Conversion of the latter produced an AA yield of
36.8% and an FA yield of 18.7% (entry 7, Table 1).

Additionally, other possible intermediates
with 1–3 carbon
atom(s) were tested (entries 8–15). These transformations result
in either low conversions (1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol, ethylene
glycol, methanol, and formaldehyde) or low yields of FA with no AA
formation (glyoxal, glyoxylic acid, and oxalic acid). Therefore, these
were not the intermediates of the cellulose conversion. Hydrolysis
products HMF and furfural may be the intermediates (entries 16–17),
but FA and AA were generated much more possibly via levulinic acid.

The products FA, AA, and GA were at last tested (entries 18–20, Table 1). GA was not fully
converted and yielded FA. FA and AA were relatively stable with <7%
decomposition.

According to the study on model compounds and
hydrolysis–oxidation
relationship (Section 3.3) and the results reported by Wasserscheid et al.,14 a proposed pathway of cellulose conversion in
FeCl3–H2SO4 aqueous solution
with O2 as the oxidant can be concluded, as shown in Scheme 1. Cellulose is first
converted into d-glucose (in equilibrium with d-mannose),21 which initiates two parallel reactions: retro-aldol
condensation and hydrolysis. Retro-aldol condensation leads to C3–C4
bond cleavage, producing d-glyceraldehyde and 1,3-dihydroxyacetone.17 These two C3 intermediates are further oxidized
to FA and glycolaldehyde, which is further oxidized to GA. GA remains
as the final product with partial degradation to FA and CO2. 1,3-Dihydroxyacetone can also be dehydrated to methylglyoxal, which
is further oxidized to FA, AA, and CO2. Hydrolysis results
in levulinic acid formation, which yields a large amount of AA, as
the main pathway for AA formation.

3.5 Reuse of the Catalyst
It is necessary
to test the reusability of the catalyst from the view point of further
application. The catalyst can be recovered after organic solvent extraction
of the products.21 After four runs, the
conversions of cellulose and yields of FA show no significant decrease,
as shown in Figure 6. This result indicates that FeCl3–H2SO4 catalytic system exhibits good performance in the
reusability.

0.100
g; FeCl3, 0.0466 wt %; H2SO4, 2.0
wt %; H2O, 6.0 cm3; O2, 3.0 MPa;
temperature, 170 °C; time, 50 min.

3.6 Iron(III) ⇌ Iron(II) Mutual Transformation
in the Catalytic Process
During the transformation, iron(III)
can possibly oxidize the substrate to generate iron(II) first. Subsequently,
the formed iron(II) can reasonably be oxidized as iron(III) form by
O2, according to the lower redox potential of iron(III)/iron(II)
than O2/H2O (Eθ(O2/H2O) = 1.229 V, Eθ(iron(III)/iron(II)) = 0.771 V). Further study on the
detection of iron(III) and iron(II) in reaction mixture confirms this
assumption. Mixing of KSCN with FeCl3–H2SO4 aqueous solution gave a solution with a color of dark
yellow, indicating the interaction between KSCN and iron(III). After
the cellulose conversion under the FeCl3–H2SO4 system with O2, the mixing of reaction
mixture with KSCN also provided the same color of the solution, suggesting
the existence of iron(III) after reaction. In the absence of O2, no color change after mixing of KSCN and the reaction mixture,
indicating no iron(III) detection. Iron(II) in the absence of O2 can be found by UV–vis spectrum after a complexation
of iron(II) and phenanthroline (see Figure 7). Therefore, during the oxidation, the catalyst
FeCl3 shows its catalytic ability by a mutual transformation
between iron(III) and iron(II).

Figure 7 UV–vis spectra of reaction mixtures
after conversion and
after conversion without O2 (replaced by N2 with
the same initial pressure). Reaction conditions: cellulose, 0.100
g; FeCl3, 0.0466 wt %; H2SO4, 2.0
wt %; H2O, 6.0 cm3; O2 (or N2), 3.0 MPa; temperature, 160 °C; time, 80 min.

4 Conclusions
In this work, a variety of metal salts in acidic aqueous solution
for the conversion of cellulose into FA under O2 were tested,
and iron(III) was selected as a more environmentally benign and readily
available catalyst for FA formation, with a comparable yield (51.2%,
based on carbon) with that of vanadium(V). The effect of reaction
parameters was studied, and the competition between oxidation and
hydrolysis were found and discussed in detail. FeCl3 and
H2SO4 can accelerate oxidation and hydrolysis,
respectively, whereas suppress the other one. The effects can reflect
on the product distribution. Intermediates were found and the pathway
from cellulose to products was reasonably proposed. The reusability
of the catalytic system shows no significant decrease in both conversion
and FA yield after four runs. The mechanism study suggests the catalytic
ability was derived by a mutual transformation between iron(III) and
iron(II), in which iron(III) is reduced to iron(II) by substrates,
and then iron(II) is reoxidized to iron(III) by O2.
