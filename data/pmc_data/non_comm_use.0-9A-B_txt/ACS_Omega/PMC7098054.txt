The influence of
hammer mill screen size (4.5 and 8.5 mm) and enzyme
addition (control and 500 ppm) on olive fruit cell wall breakdown
and its consequences in terms of oil recovery and the phenolic content
of olive oil was studied at the laboratory scale for “Arbequina”
and “Koroneiki” at two different maturities. Water recovery
and water-soluble carbohydrates in olive paste after malaxation were
measured as an indicator of cell wall breakdown. Smaller screen size
and enzymes increase oil recovery for Arbequina with a maturity index
of 1.6 (6.3–6.6%); and for Koroneiki at a maturity index of
0.2 (15.0–38%) and 2.6 (1.3–4.3%). For both cultivars,
the increase in oil recovery is larger in green fruits compared to
more ripe fruit. Water recovery and water-soluble carbohydrates increase
with small screen size and the enzyme treatments, even when no increment
in oil recovery is observed. The water recovery range was 143–239%
for Arbequina and 150–262% for Koroneiki; water-soluble carbohydrate
range was 1.8–12.7 g/kg for Arbequina and 0.5–5.4 g/kg
for Koroneiki. In general, smaller hammer mill screen size and enzymes
increase total phenols in the oil, with a larger difference between
control and treatment for green fruit than for the ripe fruit. For
Arbequina, increases in total phenol content were in the range of
45–60 and 5–20% at maturity index 1.6 and 3.3, respectively.
For Koroneiki, the increases were in the range of 31–121 and
7–9% at maturity index 0.2 and 2.6, respectively. Application
of cell wall-degrading enzymes improves the cell wall breakdown caused
by hammer mill, leading to higher oil recovery and total phenol content.
The magnitude of the effect depends on the cultivar and olive fruit
maturity.

==== Body
Introduction
Crushing is the first operation for olive
oil extraction. Fruit
tissues need to be ruptured so that oil can be released from the oil
bodies, where it is located inside the fruit cells. While several
crusher types are available in the market, the hammer mill is the
most widely used nowadays in the olive oil industry. The hammer mill
screen size and screen open area have an impact on the minor components
of olive oil. Previous works indicate that a smaller screen size produces
higher yields and oils with higher concentration of total phenols
and secoiridoid derivatives.1,2 Nonetheless, crushing
is not completely efficient at breaking olive fruit cell wall and
releasing oil bodies from the cellulose and lignin matrix;3 as a result, a portion of the oil is entrapped
in olive pomace or emulsified in waste water,4 leading to product losses and decrements in the efficiency of the
extraction process.

Enzymes have been suggested as an effective
processing aid during
olive oil extraction. In particular, the addition of cellulase, hemicellulose,
and pectinase cocktails after crushing and during malaxation has been
shown to increase both the yield and quality of virgin olive oil.5 Higher content of phenolic as well as other relevant
minor components has been associated with the use of enzymes.6−11 From a mechanistic standpoint, the addition of enzymes after crushing
may increase the release of phenolic compounds from the cell wall
matrix, increasing their concentration in the olive paste.5 However, limited research has shown that cultivars
and maturity of the olive fruit have a determinant impact on the magnitude
of the effect of commercial enzymatic cocktails on both the yield
and phenolic compounds.10−12

In this study, we explored
the relative effect of hammer mill screen
size and the addition of cell wall degrading enzymes on yield and
phenolic compound content of olive oil. When olive fruit cell walls
are broken down or degraded, water and soluble carbohydrates are released
into the olive paste. Therefore, the impact of crushing and enzymes
on cell wall breakdown was assessed by the measurement of water release
and total water-soluble carbohydrates in the olive paste. Since changes
in cell wall constitution and phenolic content of the olive fruit
during ripening and across cultivars are known factors affecting extraction
efficiency and phenolic content in olive oil, these factors were also
considered in the experimental design. “Arbequina” and
“Koroneiki” were selected for this experiment since
both are common super-high-density cultivars used for olive oil production
and have naturally different total content and profile of phenolic
compounds.

Results and Discussion
Oil Recovery
Maturation and ripening
index changes
with time depending highly on the genotype of olive cultivars, which
have a major impact on olive oil composition; the two cultivars studied
in this experiment, Arbequina and Koroneiki, were considered separately
for the analysis of variance (ANOVA). When the ANOVA was performed
considering cultivars as a factor, the impact of this variable was
significant for all of the combination levels of this experiment (data
not shown). Therefore, the impact of maturity, screen size, and enzymes
on the yield and phenolic content of olive oil will be discussed individually
for each cultivar.

The maturity index (MI), moisture content,
and fat content were measured for both cultivars are listed in Table 1. At the two different
harvest times, MI was higher for Arbequina compared to Koroneiki,
suggesting that Arbequina matured earlier compared with Koroneiki.
Results for oil recovery are shown in (top) Figures 1 and 2 for Arbequina
and Koroneiki cultivars, respectively. For Arbequina, values ranged
between 57.3 and 68.1%. For Koroneiki, the range was from 48.1 to
88.4%. The lower moisture content of Koroneiki contributed to the
higher oil recovery observed for this cultivar compared to Arbequina
across all of the treatments.13 While oil
recoveries increased with maturity and fat accumulation for both cultivars,
a bigger increment was observed for Koroneiki.

Independently of the crushing conditions used, the
addition of
enzymes before malaxation produced a statistically significant increase
in oil recovery for Arbequina at MI = 1.6 (6.6% for G1 and 6.3% for
G2) and for Koroneiki at MI = 0.2 (15.0% for G1 and 38% for G2) and
MI = 2.6 (1.3% for G1 and 4.3% for G2). The increment in oil recovery
for Arbequina at MI = 3.3 was not statistically significant. These
percentages of increment in oil recovery are in accordance with previous
results involving other cultivars and enzymes.5 Oil recoveries for Koroneiki cultivar seemed to be more affected
by the usage of enzymes than for Arbequina. This effect might be related
to both a higher moisture content of the Arbequina fruit compared
with Koroneiki and a lower maturity index of the Koroneiki fruit.14 While different concentrations of enzymes were
not included during this experiment, enzyme dosage has shown a positive
correlation with oil recovery and total phenols for “Coratina,”15 suggesting that the magnitude of the effect
observed for Koroneiki might be reached for Arbequina at a higher
enzyme dosage.

Regarding hammer mill screen size, the impact
on oil recovery depended
on both maturity and cultivar. For Arbequina, no effect of the screen
size was observed for MI = 1.6 when no enzymes were added. On the
contrary, when enzymes were used, a slight decrease in oil recovery
was observed for larger screen sizes. For Arbequina at MI = 3.3, oil
recovery increased with a larger grid size, with and without enzyme
addition (3.3% without enzyme and 3.6% with enzyme). An opposite trend
was observed for Koroneiki in which oil recovery decreased with larger
grid sizes. For MI = 0.2 the decrement was 22.7 and 7.8%, for treatments
without and with the addition of enzyme, respectively, and for MI
= 2.3, the decrement was 10.3 and 7.6%, respectively. This behavior
regarding the screen size had been reported for other cultivars.1,2 These findings suggest that crushing conditions should be chosen
according to cultivar and maturity; however, more research including
a wider range of maturities and cultivars is required to confirm these
observations.

Water Recovery
When cell walls are
broken by either
mechanical or chemical means, water, which is the main component in
plant cells, is released from the cytoplasm into the media. Therefore,
water recovery can be a useful index for measuring cell wall breakdown
during olive oil extraction. The results for water recovery are shown
in (middle) Figures 1 and 2, for Arbequina and Koroneiki, respectively.
Arbequina values ranged between 5.1 and 27.4%, whereas Koroneiki values
ranged between 3.0 and 29.5%. For Arbequina, more mature fruits showed
lower values for water recovery, while the opposite trend was observed
for Koroneiki.

Enzymes significantly increased water recovery
for Arbequina and Koroneiki at both studied maturities. For Arbequina
at MI = 1.6, relative increments in water recovery of treatment compared
to control were 143 and 162% for G1 and G2, respectively. For MI =
3.3, the increase in water recovery was 239% for G1 and 178% for G2.
For Koroneiki at MI = 0.2, increment in water recovery when enzymes
were used was 200% for G1 and 150% for G2. For MI = 2.6, the increase
was 269 and 252% for G1 and G2, respectively.

Regarding the
hammer mill screen size, the lower maturity index
fruit yielded a lower water recovery with larger screen sizes, while
the higher maturity index fruit presented higher values of water recovery
with larger screen sizes. The same trend between these two variables
was observed for oil recovery. The decrease in water recovery with
larger screen sizes is consistent with a lower degree of tissue disruption
expected from the lower retention time inside the hammer mill when
larger screen sizes are used.2 However,
more mature fruits may facilitate the generation of emulsions and
the retention of water in the pomace when a more violent crushing
is performed. Koroneiki presented the same trend for water recovery
as the one observed for oil recovery; smaller screen sizes caused
larger oil recoveries, independently of maturity and the use of enzymes.

Water-Soluble Carbohydrates
The measurement of water-soluble
carbohydrates has been used to determine the effect of hydrolytic
enzymes on several feedstock products,16 including olive paste.17 Results for
water-soluble carbohydrates are shown in (bottom) Figures 1 and 2 for Arbequina and Koroneiki, respectively. For Arbequina, the values
ranged between 1.8 and 12.7 g/kg. For Koroneiki, the range was between
0.5 and 5.4 g/kg.

For all treatments, values of water-soluble
carbohydrates followed the same trend observed for water recovery:
addition of enzymes significantly increased the concentration of water-soluble
carbohydrates likely due to increased hydrolysis of the olive fruit
cell wall by the enzymes. For Arbequina at MI = 1.6, the application
of smaller screen sizes increased the water-soluble carbohydrates,
supporting the idea that smaller screen size causes more damage to
the olive fruit tissue. Nevertheless, the increase of water-soluble
carbohydrates caused by the addition of enzymes was greater compared
to the one exerted by the hammer mill screen size. This observation
is consistent with the results of water recovery, where the application
of enzymes was more impactful than changes in screen sizes.

For Arbequina at MI = 3.3, screen sizes caused no effect in the
absence of enzymes. However, when enzymes were added, the concentration
of water-soluble carbohydrates was higher for larger screen sizes,
showing the same interaction observed for oil and water recoveries.
Nonetheless, the same interaction was not observed in the case of
Koroneiki, where water-soluble carbohydrates increased with the addition
of enzymes and smaller screen sizes.

Cell wall composition has
been shown to change during the ripening
process.18,19 In particular, pectic and hemicellulosic
polymers are solubilized and lost within the cell wall matrix when
the fruit matures.20 In the advanced ripening
stage, cell wall polysaccharides are degraded and solubilized. This
degradation of the cell wall might expose layers with different polysaccharide
compositions that are not targeted by the enzymes used for this experiment.

Total Phenol Content in Olive Paste
Results for total
phenol content in the olive paste are shown in (upper) Figures 3 and 4, for Arbequina and Koroneiki, respectively. For Arbequina values
ranged between 2.1 and 11.6 g/kg, whereas for Koroneiki the range
was from 1.3 to 8.0 g/kg.

mm, respectively; MI: maturity index. Different letters indicate significant
differences (α = 0.05) according to the Fisher LSD test.

Enzymes increased the concentration of phenols
in the olive paste
and had a larger effect compared to the hammer mill screen size. For
Arbequina at MI = 1.6, total phenol concentration was higher when
the addition of enzymes was combined with a larger screen size. The
same was observed for Koroneiki at MI = 2.3. Koroneiki at MI = 0.2
presented the highest phenolic content when the smaller screen size
was combined with enzymes. The interaction between maturity, crushing,
and enzymes might be explained by the generation of emulsions, changes
in cell wall constitution, and/or the activities of phenol-related
enzymes during the extraction process.

The use of smaller screen
size increased the concentration of phenols
in the olive paste, supporting the hypothesis that smaller screen
sizes release phenolic compounds more efficiently by breaking down
the olive fruit cell wall where phenols have formed a complex.1,17 Arbequina at MI = 3.3 showed no statistically significant difference
between the two studied screen sizes. It can be suggested that changes
in cell wall constitution, in addition to changes in phenol-related
enzymatic activities and overall phenolic concentration, affect the
way screen size affects the concentration of phenol during crushing
according to cultivar and maturity.

Phenolic Profile in Olive
Oil
All treatments resulted
in olive oils with quality parameters within the limits for the extra
virgin category according to USDA21 and
IOC22 standards (results not shown). Total
phenol content results are shown in (lower) Figures 3 and 4. Values ranged
between 149 and 294 mg/kg for Arbequina and between 42.7 and 522 mg/kg
for Koroneiki.

As reported elsewhere,1,2 total
phenols decreased with larger screen sizes, following a similar trend
as the one observed for oil recovery. For Arbequina at MI = 1.6, smaller
screen sizes yielded higher content in total phenols. However, no
effect was observed for MI = 3.3. Enzymes significantly increased
total phenol content in olive oil for all maturities and screen sizes
except for Arbequina at MI = 3.3. However, the effect of enzyme addition
was more pronounced with fruits of lower maturity index. For Arbequina
at MI = 1.6, relative increments in total phenol content for treatment
compared to control were 45 and 60% for G1 and G2, respectively. For
MI = 3.3, the increase in total phenols was 20% for G1 and 5% for
G2. Koroneiki at MI = 0.2 presented an increment of 121% for G1 and
31% for G2. For MI = 2.6, the increase was 7 and 9% for G1 and G2,
respectively.

Smaller screen sizes increased total phenol content
for Koroneiki
at both maturities. The addition of enzymes increased the concentration
of total phenols in Koroneiki oil in all conditions except for greener
Koroneiki crushed with larger grid sizes. As observed for Arbequina,
the increase in the total phenol content with the addition of enzymes
was higher for the greener Koroneiki fruit. Total phenol content dramatically
increased with ripening in the case of Koroneiki, as described before
for other cultivars and regions.23,24 Results for
individual phenolic compounds are detailed in Tables 2 and 3, for Arbequina
and Koroneiki, respectively. In accordance with previous studies using
the above-mentioned cultivars,25,26 the main phenolic compounds
detected for all treatments were the dialdehydic form of oleuropein
and ligstroside aglycones (3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA)
along with the aldehydic forms (3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA, respectively) and 1-pinoresinol. 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, 3,4-DHPEA-EA, p-HPEA-EDA, and p-HPEA-EA presented the
higher concentrations and wider range among all of the treatments.

3,4-DHPEA-EDA, dialdehydic form of oleuropein aglycone; 3,4-DHPEA-EA,
aldehydic form of oleuropein aglycone; p-HPEA-EDA,
dialdehydic form of ligstroside aglycone; p-HPEA-EA,
aldehydic form of ligstroside aglycone.

For Arbequina, 3,4-DHPEA-EDA was the most abundant
phenolic compound
at both maturities, with a range between 47.9 and 129.8 mg/kg. 3,4-DHPEA-EA
range was between 6.5 and 10.6 mg/kg. p-HPEA-EDA ranged between
28.4 and 39.6 mg/kg. p-HPEA-EA range was between
3.1 and 4.6 mg/kg. 1-Pinoresinol was mostly affected by hammer mill
screen size and ranged between 50.1 and 60.0 mg/kg. For the greener
fruit 1-pinoresinol concentration increased with larger screen sizes,
while for the more mature fruit the trend was inverted. At MI = 1.6,
relative increments in 3,4-DHPEA-EDA of treatment compared to control
were 68 and 137% for G1 and G2, respectively. For MI = 3.3, the increase
in 3,4-DHPEA-EDA was 32% for G1 and 11% for G2.

Koroneiki showed p-HPEA-EDA as the main phenolic
compound at MI = 0.2, with a range between 16.9 and 39.6 mg/kg. For
MI = 2.3, the main phenolic compound was 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, with a range
between 1.4 and 305.5 mg/kg. 3,4-DHPEA-EA range was between 1.0 and
82.5 mg/kg. p-HPEA-EA ranged between 4.3 and 24.0
mg/kg. 1-Pinoresinol was mostly affected by maturity and ranged between
18.6 and 31.0 mg/kg. Green Koroneiki was particularly affected by
the addition of enzymes: at MI = 0.2, the increment in 3,4-DHPEA-EDA
when enzymes were used was 1150% for G1 and 115% for G2. For MI =
2.6, the increase was 9 and 15% for G1 and G2, respectively.

Overall, ligstroside derivatives presented higher concentrations
when smaller grid size was used, these results being consistent with
previously published results for Arbequina and Cornicabra by Inarejos-García
et al. Furthermore, the increase in the concentration of ligstrosides
caused by the addition of enzymes was described previously by Vierhuis
et al. for “Moraiolo” treated with Olivex and Novoferm
12, two alternative commercial enzymatic aids for the olive oil industry.

The impact exerted by the addition of 500 ppm of enzymes was larger
compared to the one exerted by changes in hammer mill screen size,
suggesting the potential of enzymatic aids to obtain olive oils beyond
the possibilities of the traditional mechanical extraction process.
Moreover, the increment in individual ligstroside derivatives was
larger in greener fruits compared to more ripe fruits, further demonstrating
the relevance of the changes in cell wall composition during ripening
on the olive oil extraction process.

The comparative effect
of hammer mill screen size and enzymes on
oil recovery and the phenolic composition of olive oil was studied
for super-high-density Arbequina and Koroneiki at two maturities.
Oil quality parameters such as free fatty acidity, peroxide value,
and UV absorbance were measured for all of the treatments; no differences
were found in the different treatments of crushing conditions and
enzyme additions (data not shown). Treatments that increased oil recoveries
and phenolic content also presented higher water recoveries, water-soluble
carbohydrates, and total phenols in the olive paste, demonstrating
a greater degree of cell wall breakdown during the extraction process.
Enzyme addition increased the yield and phenolic content of the olive
oil, suggesting that the mechanical action of crushing did not disrupt
all of the olive fruit cells and release the oil from the oil bodies.

Finally, the effect of crushing and enzymes depended on the cultivar
and maturity of the olive fruit; thus, both factors should be considered
when choosing optimal processing conditions. Enzymes were more effective
for lower maturity indexes, not showing an effect for Arbequina at
a maturity index of 3.3. Hence, while different concentrations and
composition of the enzymatic cocktail were not tested in this research,
these factors should be considered in future studies to understand
the full potential and limitations of enzymatic aids for the olive
oil industry.

Materials and Methods
Olive Samples
This study was carried out with olives
harvested from the commercial orchards of California Olive Ranch (Artois,
CA). Olives from super-high-density Arbequina and Koroneiki cultivars
were hand-harvested in October and November 2018. Approximately 15
kg of fruits was harvested for each cultivar and time, and the oil
was extracted using an Abencor system. All quality and compositional
measurements were carried out in triplicate. Fruit parameters are
shown in Table 1.

Maturity Index
Maturity index (MI) was measured by
evaluating the color of the olive fruit skin and flesh.27 Briefly, a hundred olives were randomly chosen
and categorized into seven groups according to the epicarp color,
from right-green skin (group N = 0) to black skin
with 100% purple flesh (group N = 7). Maturity index
is given by  where N is the group number
and n is the number of olives in that group.

Moisture
Content
Olives were crushed with a hammer
mill, and the paste (60 ± 0.1 g) was weighed in a beaker and
placed in the oven at 105 °C until attaining a constant weight.
The beaker was transferred to a desiccator, and the weight of the
dry paste was registered after 2 h.

Fat Content
The
dried olive sample (20.0 ± 0.1
g) was weighed in a cellulose extraction thimble and extracted using n-hexane for 6 h in a Soxhlet apparatus. When the extraction
finished, the solvent was removed in a rotary evaporator and the residual
solvent was eliminated by placing the sample in the oven at 105 °C
for 3 h. The fat content in wet basis was calculated as follows:  where MC is the moisture content
and FCdry basis is the fat content of the sample expressed
on
a dry basis.

Olive Oil Extraction
Olive oil was
extracted using
an Abencor analyzer (MC2 Ingenieria y Sistemas S.L., Seville, Spain)
consisting of a hammer crusher equipped with exchangeable sieves,
a malaxer, and a basket centrifuge. Olive samples (700 g) were crushed
in triplicate using two different screen sizes (G1 = 4.5 mm and G2
= 8.5 mm). After malaxation (45 min at 27 °C), the olive paste
was centrifuged for 2 min in the basket centrifuge. Oil was separated
from vegetation waters by decantation and centrifuged at 3000g for 10 min before being stored at −20 °C in
plastic bottles without headspace until analysis. For the trials including
enzymes, 500 ppm of Novozymes Pectinex Ultra Olio was added right
after crushing and before malaxation.

Oil Recovery
Oil
recovery was calculated according
to the fat content of the olive fruits and the volume of olive oil
obtained according to  where 0.915 is the oil density, Voil is the volume of oil extracted, molives is the mass of processed olives, and FColives is the fat content of the olives in the wet basis.

Water Recovery
Water recovery was calculated according
to the moisture content of the olive fruit and the volume of water
obtained after centrifugation according to  where Vwater is
the volume of water obtained after centrifugation, molives is the mass of processed olives, and MColives is the moisture content of the olives. δwater is
the density of the water and was considered as 1 g/mL.

Analysis of
Fruit Cell Wall Degradation
The level of
cell wall breakdown was evaluated by measuring water-soluble carbohydrates
in olive paste samples at the end of the malaxation period, before
the centrifugation step, following the extraction protocol described
by Slominski et al.28 Total water-soluble
carbohydrate quantification was performed using the anthrone method.29

Analysis of Total Phenol Content in Olive
Paste
Total
phenol content in the olive paste after the malaxation period was
quantified according to the method suggested by Gómez-Rico
et al.30 with some modifications. Briefly,
the sample (4.0 g) was homogenized with a mixture of methanol/water
(40 mL, 80:20 v/v) for 2 min with vortex agitation for 1 min. The
suspension obtained was shaken (20 min, 150 rpm) and then centrifuged
(2000g, 10 min). The hydro-methanolic phase was recovered
and filtered with a 0.45 μm nylon syringe filter. Phenolic compounds
were quantified by the Folin–Ciocalteu method using a calibration
curve of caffeic acid and expressed as gram per kilogram of olive
paste.

Quality Parameters
Free fatty acids, peroxide value,
and UV absorbances (K232, K270, and ΔK) were determined according
to AOCS standard methods Ca 5a-40(09), Cd 8b-90(09), and Ch 5-91(09),
respectively.

Total Phenol Determination in Oil Samples
The sample
(2.0 ± 0.1 g) was dissolved in hexane (1 mL) and extracted three
times with methanol/water (2 mL; 60:40 v/v). After centrifugation
(3000g, 6 min), the supernatants were collected,
and total phenol content was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu
colorimetric method. An aliquot (0.2 mL) of the phenolic extract was
diluted with distilled water up to 5 mL and mixed with the Folin–Ciocalteu
reagent (0.5 mL) and sodium carbonate (1 mL; 35% w/v). After bringing
it to a final volume of 10 mL, the mixture was stored in the dark
for 2 h. The absorbance at 725 nm was measured, and the concentration
of phenolic compounds was calculated using an external calibration
curve prepared with caffeic acid.

Phenolic Compounds Profile
in Oil Samples
The sample
(2.500 ± 0.001 g) was weighed in a 10 mL caramel-colored vial
containing the internal standard solution (0.5 mL, 6.75 × 10–2 mg/mL of p-hydroxyphenyl-acetic
acid) and n-hexane (6 mL). A 1000 mg/6 mL diol-bonded
phase cartridge (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) was put in a vacuum
elution apparatus and conditioned with methanol (6 mL) and hexane
(6 mL), consecutively. After the oil solution was applied onto the
diol cartridge, the cartridge was washed with hexane (6 mL) twice
and hexane/ethyl acetate (6 mL, 90:10, v/v) once. The cartridge was
then eluted with methanol (10 mL), and the solvent was evaporated
in a rotatory evaporator at room temperature under vacuum until dry.
Finally, the residue was reconstituted with methanol/water (1 mL,
1:1, v/v) for injection.

A 5 μm, 250 mm × 4.6 mm
C18 column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used for UPLC
(Infinity 1290, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) analysis. The
sample injection volume was 20 μL, and the flow rate was 1.0
mL/min. In this analysis, the mobile phase A was water/acetic acid
(98:2, v/v) and B was methanol/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v). The solvent
gradient changed according to the following conditions: from 0 to
25 min, 95% A–5% B to 70% A–30% B; from 25 to 50 min,
to 65% A–35% B; from 50 to 65 min, to 30% A–70% B; from
65 to 70 min, to 100% B; the gradient was then brought back to 95%
A–5% B in 5 min. The diode array detection (DAD) was performed
at 280 and 340 nm. The quantification was determined by using the
concentration relative to the concentration of IS.

Statistical
Analysis
A factor-factorial experimental
design considering olive cultivar (Arbequina and Koroneiki), maturity
(low and high maturity index), hammer mill screen size (4.5 and 8.5
mm), and addition of cell wall-degrading enzymes during malaxation
(control and 500 ppm) was used for this experiment. Factorial ANOVA
was carried out to assess the effect of each of the factors on oil
recovery, water recovery, total water-soluble carbohydrates, total
phenol content in the olive paste, and total and individual phenol
content on olive oil. Data normality and homoscedasticity assumptions
were tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test and Breusch–Pagan
test, respectively. Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD)
tests were applied to establish the differences between each treatment.
Data was analyzed using Minitab v. 19.2.
