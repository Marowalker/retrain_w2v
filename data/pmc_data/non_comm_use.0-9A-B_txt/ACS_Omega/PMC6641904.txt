Light emission from the color centers
in diamonds can be significantly
enhanced by their interaction with optical microcavities. In the conventional
chip-based hybrid approach, nanodiamonds are placed directly on the
surface of microcavity chips created using fabrication-matured material
platforms. However, the achievable enhancement due to the Purcell
effect is limited because of the evanescent interaction between the
electrical field of the cavity and the nanodiamond. Here, we propose
and statistically analyze a diamond in a nanopocket structure as a
new route to achieve a high enhancement of light emission from the
color center in the nanodiamond, placed in an optical microcavity.
We demonstrate that by creating a nanopocket within the photonic crystal
L3 cavity and placing the nanodiamond in, a significant and a robust
control over the local density of states can be obtained. The antinodes
of the electric field relocate to the nanosized air gaps within the
nanopocket, between the nanodiamond and the microcavity. This creates
an elevated and uniform electric field across the nanodiamond that
is less sensitive to perturbations in the shape and orientation of
the nanodiamond. Using a silicon nitride photonic crystal L3 cavity
and aiming at silicon-vacancy and nitrogen-vacancy color centers in
diamond, we performed a statistical analysis of light emission, assuming
random positions of color centers and dipole moment orientations.
We showed that in cavities with experimentally feasible quality factors,
the diamond in the nanopocket structure produces Purcell factor distributions
with mean and median that are tenfold larger compared to what can
be achieved when the diamond is on the surface of the microcavity.

1 Introduction
Single-photon sources1−3 have paramount importance in the
quantum technology, as they constitute the fundamental building blocks
for quantum networks and information processing and sensing. One of
the most promising candidates for single-photon sources in nanophotonic
systems is optically active impurities (color centers) in diamonds.3−13 Color centers in diamonds, at their zero-phonon line (ZPL) frequencies,
act as photostable and coherent single-photon emitters.

In a
bulk crystalline diamond, the emission rate of a ZPL transition
only accounts for a fraction of the entire emission. For instance,
in a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV–) center,
only 4% of the emitted light is originated from the ZPL transition.9−11 The percentage of light emission into the ZPL frequency can be significantly
enhanced by means of an optical cavity.14−17 The cavity modifies the emission
rate, by changing the available local density of states (LDOS) for
light emission. A progress has been achieved on the fabrication of
resonant photonic structures out of diamond.14,15 However, the hardness of the diamond material makes shaping and
molding of cavities at nano- or microscales in crystalline diamonds
a strenuous process and limits the achievable performance level.

Thus, a hybrid system18−23 is often explored. Here, the diamonds are either in nanodiamond18,19,21−23 or in unpatterned
blanket forms,20 and their optical emission
is evanescently coupled to the optical microcavities, created using
fabrication-friendly material platforms. Importantly, with fabrication-matured
material platforms, such as gallium phosphide (GaP)18−20- and silicon
nitride (SiN)21,22-based platforms, the hybrid approach
allows the development of much needed, fully integrable, and scalable
on-chip quantum optical devices that consist of waveguides, microcavities,
integrated beam splitters, and other optical components. Examples
of on-chip microcavities include toroidal,23,24 disk,25 ring,26,27 and a variety of one-dimensional28−30 and two-dimensional31−38 photonic crystal resonators.

The major bottleneck of the hybrid
approach is only that the evanescent
portion of the electric field couples to the diamond. Thus, the amount
of LDOS that the external microcavity can offer to color centers in
diamonds is very limited. In this article, we introduce and explore
the idea of having the diamond in a nanopocket (DINP) within the core
of the on-chip microcavity. We show that deterioration to the quality
factor (Q) of the cavity due to the presence of the
nanopocket is recovered by filling the nanopocket with the nanodiamond.
The nanodiamonds can be positioned in the nanopocket using the pick
and place technique that make uses either an atomic force microscopy
tip39−41 or an scanning electron microscope with a nanomanipulator.42,43 With the DINP structure, the antinodes of the cavity relocate to
the nanosized air gap regions within the DINP structure and elevate
the electric field across the nanodiamonds. The DINP structure thus
becomes an essential part of the cavity, creating a prime influence
on the mode volume and enabling strong coupling of an electric field
to the color centers in the nanodiamond.

To illustrate the idea
of DINP, we explicitly considered a geometrical
structure as in Figure 1a—a SiN photonic crystal L3 cavity membrane. L3 cavities have
been proven to be very useful in various cavity quantum electrodynamics
experiments in both strong35,36 and weak coupling regimes.37,38 The choice of the SiN material for making the cavity has the following
basis: SiN has a refractive index of 2.0, and it is transparent for
visible light. The refractive index of SiN is closer to the refractive
index of nanodiamond (2.4), and hence, the losses due to the index
mismatch can be alleviated. The fabrication method is highly compatible
with the conventional CMOS silicon technology, and good quality L3
cavities made of SiN have been experimentally demonstrated for light
at visible wavelengths.22,33Figure 2 manifests the geometry of the DINP structure.
The details of the L3 cavity and the DINP structure will be further
elaborated in section 2. As we shall show, the proposed DINP structure is robust with respect
to perturbations in the shape, orientations, and the position of the
nanodiamonds within the nanopocket.

Additionally, the purple-colored hole is shifted to 0.2a horizontally, away from the cavity. (b) Cross section (xy plane, z = 0) of the localized cavity mode profile,

The paper is organized as follows: after the introduction, section 2 describes the geometry
of the L3 cavity and the DINP structure. Section 3.1 presents the quality factors of the DINP
structure. In section 3.2, the details of Purcell enhancement using DINP are elaborated.
Theoretical limits and experimentally achievable figure of merits
are shown for cavities with experimentally feasible quality factors
and ideal quality factors. Section 3.3 addresses the robustness of the DINP structure with
respect to perturbations in the shape, orientations, and the position
of the nanodiamond. In section 3.4, a statistical analysis of Purcell factors with realistic
dipole configurations for negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV–) centers9−11 and NV– centers12,13 is presented. We present achievable statistical quantities, assuming
the positions of the color centers, and their axis orientations as
random variables. Finally, section 4 concludes the paper.

2 Backbone
Cavity and the DINP Structure
Figure 1a shows
the schematic of the photonic crystal L3 cavity. The L3 cavity is
created by removing three central holes from a slab patterned with
holes in a triangular lattice. The slab has a thickness a, and it is surrounded by air. The Q of the resulting
cavity is optimized22 by adjusting the
radii and the positions of the surrounding cavity holes (see Figure 1a). The optimized Q is ∼4700. Figure 1b displays the electric field cross section of the
fundamental mode profile on the z = 0 plane. The
fundamental mode of the L3 cavity has a negligible z component, and the electric field around the central antinode (center
of the L3 cavity) is polarized toward the y-direction.

Figure 2 exhibits
the L3 cavity with a DINP structure. The DINP structure is created
right at the center of the L3 cavity on the x–y plane. The coordinate coincides with the (x, y) position of the antinode in the fundamental
mode (see Figure 1b).
The DINP structure consists of a nanopocket—nanohole of diameter dp and depth t, and a nanodiamond—modeled
as a cube44 of edge d.
We coined the term “pocket” to distinguish this special
hole which has a finite depth and holds the nanodiamond, to the rest
of the holes protruding through the entire SiN membrane that makes
up the L3 cavity (see the inset in Figure 2a). The t = 0 situation
recovers the case18−23 where the nanodiamond is positioned on the surface of the cavity.
We assume that the nanodiamond carries a single color center, at an
arbitrary location and at an arbitrary axis orientation. Figure 2b illustrates the
color center and its axis within the nanodiamond. The axis of the
color center represents the symmetry axis of the defects. Though the
nanodiamond is modeled as a cube, the shape of the diamond has little
relevance to the conclusion made in this article and evidence supporting
this statement will be presented in section 3.3.

For concreteness, throughout this
article, the dimensions of the
L3 cavity and the DINP structure are based on the ZPL emission wavelength
of the SiV– color center (λSiV =
738 nm). Nevertheless, the results are equally applicable for NV centers,
provided a scaling in the geometry by a factor of λNV/λSiV, where λNV = 638 nm is applied.
This advantage due to scaling is the result of negligible dispersion
in refractive indices of SiN and nanodiamond across the wavelengths,
λSiV and λNV.

In this article,
we assumed that the emission frequency of the
color center is resonant with the frequency of the cavity mode. Practically,
a discrepancy between the resonance frequencies of the emission and
the mode of the fabricated cavity is expected. Therefore, a tuning
mechanism of the cavity resonance is necessary to achieve the maximum
Purcell enhancement. Tuning mechanisms such as gas injection and local
heating have been part of many Purcell enhancement experiments reported
previously (e.g., see refs (14) and (18)).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Quality
Factors with DINP Structures
Figure 3 showcases
the Q of L3 cavities with DINP structures. The purple
line in Figure 3a represents
the Q of the L3 cavity without the DINP structure.
As expected, when a pocket is created, the Q drops.
In Figure 3a, the dropped Q levels for pockets with t = 100 nm are
shown. Specifically, the horizontal solid lines in blue, red, and
dark yellow represent the Q levels of the empty pockets
with dp = 50, 70, and 100 nm, respectively.
When the pocket is filled with a nanodiamond of size d (i.e., the DINP structure), the reduced Q is partly
recovered. The fraction of Q that is recovered increases
as a function of d (see Figure 3a).

Figure 3 (a) Quality factors of the DINP structure as
a function of nanodiamond
size. The purple line represents the quality factor of the backbone
cavity. When pockets of diameters dp =
50, 70, and 100 nm of the same thicknesses (t = 100
nm) created, quality factors drop to the levels represented by blue-,
red-, and dark yellow-colored lines, respectively. When the respective
pocket is filled with the nanodiamond of size d,
the quality factor (circle) increases as a function of d. (b) Quality factors of the DINP (dp = 100 nm and d = 60 nm) structure as a function
of pocket depth. (c) First derivative of the quality factor in (b)
with respect to the pocket depth. (d) Second derivative of the quality
factor in (b) with respect to the pocket depth.

Figure 3b
presents
the Q of the DINP structure as a function of pocket
depth t, assuming a fixed size d = 60 nm and a fixed dp = 100 nm. The
curve in Figure 3c
represents the general trend of the Q as a function
of t in DINP structures. As t increases, Q decreases. The curve Q versus t exhibits an inflection point at the critical depth, tc = 70 nm. The inflection point occurs when
the second derivative of Q with respect to t vanishes. In Figure 3c,d, we show the first and second derivatives of Q with respect to t, respectively. For t < tc, the Q drops slowly, and for t > tc, the Q drops rapidly. If the pocket
diameter
is small, a large critical depth is required to inflect the Q with respect to t. In other words, when
the opening of the pocket is small, it takes a larger pocket depth
to deteriorate the quality factor of the cavity.

In this article,
for the purpose of illustration, we considered
three DINP structures with small, medium, and large diameters of dp = 50, 70, and 100 nm, respectively. The small,
medium, and large diameter pockets are filled with commercially available
diamonds of d = 30, 40, and 60 nm, respectively.
The diamonds sizes are chosen such that the cross-sectional filling
ratio (i.e., the cross-sectional area of diamond/area of circle; see Figure 2c) at the center
planes of the diamonds is nearly equal.

3.2 Purcell
Enhancements with DINP Structures
To analyze the emission
rate of the color center within the DINP
structure, let us analyze the optical properties of the DINP structure
as a function of t. Figure 4 shows electric field distributions of the
cavity mode on the x = 0 plane for the y component of the field. x and z are components that are relatively very weak and thus are not shown.
The electric field distributions are shown for the backbone cavity
(i.e., without the DINP) and t = 0, 70, and 120 nm.
As we can clearly see from this figure, when t =
0, the field distribution is quite similar to the backbone cavity.
The antinode position for t = 0 is right at the center
of the SiN membrane. However, with the DINP structure (i.e., t = 70 and 120 nm cases), the electric field distribution
is strongly modified and the antinode position moves to the nanosized
air gap regions between the nanodiamond and the L3 cavity. This relocation
of the antinode is the direct consequence of electric field discontinuity
between the SiN–air–nanodiamond interfaces.29,30 The redistribution of the electric field also elevates the amount
of field that penetrates the nanodiamond quite significantly. The
region around the antinode has a very sensitive variation in the electric
field values. Thus, the occurrence of the antinode in the air gap
regions leaves a more uniform field to prevail through the interior
of the nanodiamond (see t = 70 and 120 nm cases in Figure 4). As we will show
later, in the statistical analysis, this is favorable as the LDOS
will be less sensitive to the random position of the color centers
which can take a position anywhere within the volume of the nanodiamond.

Figure 4 Cross
sections of the y component of the electric
field |Ey|/max(|Ey|) on the x = 0 plane. The x and z electric
field are components that are relatively very weak, and they are not
shown.

The Purcell factor45,46 represents the normalized emission
rate (or decay rate) of the emitter when it is placed inside the optical
cavity. The rate is normalized with respect to the rate in the bulk
homogeneous medium. The Purcell factor also represents the normalized
LDOS when the emitter is placed inside the optical cavity. As long
as Purcell enhancements are of the interest, classical electromagnetism
is sufficient to describe the physics of light emission from the color
center.47 Let us first evaluate the emission
rate of a dipole emitter in an optical microcavity. The power P dissipated by a current density J(r) is given by the integral , with E(r) being
the electric field. If the position of the dipole is rc, then the resulting current density can be expressed
as J(r) = −iωpδ(r – rc) with
ω and p being the angular frequency and dipole
moment, respectively. Substituting this into the expression for P and dividing by the power emitted by the dipole in the
bulk diamond of refractive index n = 2.4, we have 1  where Es(rc) is the scattered electric field with the dipole as
a point source.47,48 For the sake of illustration,
and as to establish a figure of merit, in this section, we defined
a Purcell factor, F0, which assumes that
the dipole is located right at the center of the nanodiamond (r = r0) and the dipole moment is oriented
along the dominant direction of the cavity’s electric field
(i.e., y-direction). In section 3.4, we relaxed these assumptions and presented
a statistical analysis to show how the presented results vary for
specific color centers with random distributions of locations and
orientations.

To evaluate eq 1,
we solved three-dimensional (3D) Maxwell equations using the finite
difference time domain method49,50 using a dipole source.
The field created by the dipole consists of its own field and the
scattered field. The scattered field [Es(r)] is calculated by Fourier transforming the portion of the
electric field after the dipole excitation is switched off (for more
details please see ref (51)). Figure 5a shows
the computed results for the DINP with dp = 100 nm and d = 60, as a function of pocket depth,
at the resonance wavelength of the system comprising the L3 cavity–DINP
structure. The resonance wavelengths are shown in Figure 5b. As it can be seen from Figure 5a, F0 increases as a function of t, reaches
the maximum when t = 80 nm, and decreases for t > 80 nm. For t = 80 nm, F0 is about five times larger when compare to F0 in the case where the nanodiamond is on the surface
of the cavity (i.e., t = 0). The wavelength response F0 is non-Lorentzian. As an example, Figure 5c shows the wavelength
response of F0 for t =
130 nm. As we can see from Figure 5c, the shape of the wavelength response is non-Lorentzian.

wavelength as a function of pocket depth. (c) Wavelength response

To validate the first-principles
calculation from eq 1 and to gain a more intuitive perspective
on the Purcell enhancement, we revisited Sauvan’s theory of
spontaneous emission52 for leaky optical
cavities. The theory assumes that the electric field in eq 1 can be expanded in terms of quasi-normal
modes of the cavity and defeats the earlier formulations,45,46 in which all neglect the leaky component of the cavity eigenmode.
In the case of nanodiamond, the Purcell factor from Sauvan’s
original formulation can be expressed as 2  where p̂ is the unit vector
of the dipole moment. Here, the mode volume V0 is a complex quantity, and the line-shape function LA(λ) is non-Lorentzian. The expressions
for V0 and LA(λ) are 3   4  ε(r) and H(r) are the position-dependent relative permittivity
and magnetic field, respectively. To validate the results in Figure 5a,c, let us take rc = r0 and assume p̂ is oriented along the direction of E(r0). This yields F = F0LA(λ), where  is the interested
Purcell factor at the
cavity resonance wavelength. The Purcell factor and the wavelength
response evaluated using the analytical F0 and LA(λ) are shown in Figure 5a,c, respectively.
As one can see, a very good agreement is found between the analytical F0 (from eq 1; shown as red asterisks in Figure 5a) and the numerical F0 (from eq 2;
shown as blue circles in Figure 5a). Throughout this article, unless stated otherwise,
results are obtained using eq 1. Figure 5d
plots the mode volume (eq 3) as a function of t. The presence of the DINP structure
shrinks the mode volume significantly. The mode volume decreases as t increases, but the amount of decrease in the mode volume
reduces as a function of t.

The expression  helps to understand
the trend observed
in Figure 5a. For a
shallow t, Q drops slowly (Figure 3b) but V drops rapidly, resulting in an increasing Q/V and hence an increasing F0. For a large t, Q drops rapidly
and V drops slowly, resulting in a decreasing Q/V and hence a decreasing F0. Therefore, there should be an optimal t = to where Q/V is maximized.

Figure 6a,b compares Q and F0 of the three DINP structures.
The blue line corresponds to a small-sized DINP with dp = 50 nm and d = 30 nm. The red line
corresponds to a medium-sized DINP with dp = 70 nm and d = 40 nm. The dark green line corresponds
to a large-sized DINP with dp = 100 and d = 60 (reproduced from Figure 3b and Figure 5a). As we have stated earlier, tc increases as dp decreases. This
can be clearly seen from Figure 6a. The inflection points of Q occur
at the critical depths of 90, 80, and 70 nm for the small-, medium-,
and large-sized DINP structures, respectively. From Figure 6b, we can see that the small
DINP structure exhibits the largest F0. The maximum F0 for each DINP occurs
at its optimal depth. The optimal depths are 140, 100, and 80 nm for
the small-, medium-, and large-sized DINP structures, respectively.

Figure 6 (a) Quality
factors and (b) F0 (assuming
no losses in fabrication) as a function of pocket depth for three
different DINP structures (small DINP—blue; medium DINP—red;
and large DINP—green). (c) Quality factors and (d) F0 (with fabrication losses phenomenologically
included) as a function of pocket depth for three different DINP structures
(small DINP—blue; medium DINP—red; and large DINP—green).

Now let us ask the question, provided
the Q of
the fabricated structures will be lower than the ideal theoretical
limit, what values of Purcell factors can be expected in the experimental
conditions. For this reason, we revert to experimentally measured
quality factors for SiN cavities. In the literature, quality factors
on the magnitude of 1500 are consistently reported for SiN L3 cavities
at the visible wavelength regime.22,33 To achieve
the same quality factor in the numerical simulations, we phenomenologically
include an imaginary part of 5.2 × 10–4 in
the refractive index of SiN. This will account the intrinsic losses
suffered because of the fabrication imperfections. The recalculated Q and F0 are displayed in Figure 6c,d, respectively.
As expected, we see a surge in the initially calculated F0. Nevertheless, the F0 of
DINP structures is still well above to that of the nanodiamond on
surface cases (i.e., t = 0). With the loss included,
the optimal depth (to) of the cavity is
slightly increased. From Figure 6d, we can see that the optimal depths are 160, 140,
and 100 nm for the small-, medium-, and large-sized DINP structures,
respectively.

3.3 Effect of Nanodiamond Orientation
and Shapes
In sections 3.1 and 3.2, we assumed that the
nanodiamond
takes the shape of a cube of edge d. The orientation
of the cube is assumed such that the symmetrical axis of the cube
matches with the symmetrical axis of the underlying L3 cavity. Here,
we would like to describe the influences of cube orientations and
the shapes to the level of LDOS that can be attained.

Let us
perturb, the orientation of the cube, by rotating the cube around
the z-axis by an angle θ. For the sake of discussion,
let us evaluate the changes in the results of Figure 5a which represents the case, θ = 0
(reproduced in Figure 7a). Figure 7b shows
the calculated F0 for nonzero values of
θ. The figure also illustrates a special case, R. In this special case, the cube origin on the x–y plane is displaced arbitrarily from the
center of the nanopocket. Figure 7c displays the x–y cross-sectional electric field distributions (along the plane that
cut through the center of the nanodiamond) for various θ and
in the special case R. As we can clearly see from
these figures, the orientations and the random position have almost
no effect to F0.

Figure 7 (a) F0 as a function of pocket depth
(reproduced from Figure 5a, blue circles). (b) Effect of asymmetry in the nanodiamond orientation
and position to the LDOS. (c) Electric field distribution (on the xy plane that cut through the center of the nanodiamond)
as a function of orientation.

We would like to point out the fact that the LDOS can be
enhanced
by DINP, and the enhancement can be maximized at the critical depth,
which is generally true for all shapes of nanodiamonds. As evidence,
in Figure 8, we show
the result of recalculations of Q and F0, with a volume-wise equivalent, spherical-shaped nanodiamond
(shown as asterisks). The spherical shape is chosen because it represents
a direct contrary to the cube as the sphere contains no sharp edges.
For a comparison, in Figure 8, we reproduced the results for cube with d = 60 nm and with the nanopocket of dp = 100 nm from Figures 3b and 5a and indexed them with circles. On
the other hand, the results with an equivalent spherical nanodiamond
which has a diameter of 80 nm in the same-sized nanopocket are indexed
with asterisks. As it is clear from Figure 8, both shapes yield similar Q and F0.

Figure 8 Effect of the nanodiamonds shape to (a) Q and
(b) F0 as a function of pocket depth.
The circle and asterisk represent cube and spherical shapes, respectively.

As can be seen from Figure 7c, the antinode occurs in the
nanosized gap regions between
the nanodiamond and the L3 cavity (along the y-direction:
the cavity field direction, see Figure 4). The maximum of electric field increases as the gap
narrows. Thus, the occurrence of sharp edges (which induce narrow
gaps) increases the strength of the antinodes in the gap regions.
The number of antinodes will increase with the number of sharp edges
occurring along the y-direction. However, these antinodes
have less impact to the electric field in the interior of the nanodiamond
(see Figure 7c), where
the color center (which is considered as a deep-level defect) is located.
Therefore, the exact shape has a minimal effect to the Purcell enhancement.
This is also vivid from Figure 8 where we have compared F0 of
cube (four edges) and sphere (no edge). The F0 of a cube is only slightly higher than that of a sphere for t < 90 nm and almost equal for t ≥
90 nm.

3.4 Statistical Analysis of Color Center Positions
and Their Orientations
In sections 3.2 and 3.3, the figure
of merit, F0, represents the Purcell factor
when a dipole-like emitter is placed at the center of the nanodiamond.
We assumed that the dipole moment is in perfect alignment with the
orientation of the local cavity field. These assumptions, although
useful as a figure of merit to benchmark DINP structures with respect
to their geometrical parameters, they may not represent the actual
conditions of the color centers in nanodiamonds. First, the color
center may be accompanied by more than one dipole. Second, the position
of the color center and the dipole moment orientations can vary to
a large extent. In this section, we address these issues statistically
and demonstrate realistic Purcell factors that can be expected.

Figure 9a,b exhibits
the formalism of the statistical analysis. Assuming the shape of the
nanodiamond as cubical, we selected 100 random positions of color
centers (rc) with random axis orientations,
within the interior of the cube (see Figure 9a, where one case of the color center with
a random position and orientation is depicted). As color centers are
considered as deep-level defects,9 we discarded
any possibilities of having a color center within 5 nm distance from
the faces of the cube.10 The general orientation
of the color center axis with respect to the coordinate system of
the L3 cavity is depicted in Figure 9b. The angles θ and ϕ in Figure 9b are treated as random variables.

of the color centers and their axis orientations as random variables.

50 nm and d = 30 nm. (a) Schematic of the randomly
positioned and oriented color center within the nanodiamond. The definition
for the axis orientation of the color center with respect to the xyz coordinate system is shown on the right panel. The angles
θ and ϕ are treated as random variables. (b) Three different
scenarios of dipole moment orientations with respect to the axis of
the color center. (c) Results of the statistical analysis with experimentally
L3 feasible cavities. (d) Results of the statistical analysis with
ideal L3 cavities. The inset in (c) indexes the information that the
box plot carry.

Figure 9b showcases
the configurations of dipole moments with respect to the axis of the
color center. As illustrated in this figure, depending on the nature
of the color center, the number and the orientations of the dipole
moments can vary. For simplicity, we considered three scenarios: A,
B, and C (see Figure 9c). At cryogenic temperatures, SiV centers12 have four ZPL transitions. All of the four transitions can be modeled
as single dipole emissions.12,13 Therefore, a configuration
as in A is applicable for the SiV center. On the other hand, light
emission from a strain-free NV center8−11 has a single ZPL transition.
The transition is modeled using a pair of orthogonal dipoles (with
equal strength of dipole moment),10,11 perpendicular
to the NV axis. Thus, the configuration in B is applicable for the
NV center. In addition to the configurations in A and B, we also considered
the third scenario as in C, assuming we can adjust the dipole orientation
(as it has been demonstrated in experimental cases39−43) such that it is parallel to the local electric field.

Using eq 2, the Purcell
factors are evaluated for 100 different combinations of rc, θ, and ϕ and the resulting distributions
are statistically analyzed. In B, the Purcell factor represents the
average Purcell factors of the two orthogonal dipoles (see Figure 9b). In all cases
of A, B, and C, we evaluated the five-number summary, consisting of
the minimum, first quartile (Q1, 25th percentile),
median, third quartile (Q3, 75th percentile), and
maximum values of the distributions. The maximum and minimum values
represent the extreme values after the outliers are discarded. In
statistics, outliers are the data points that are numerically distant
from the rest of the points. They represent rarely occurring, extreme
Purcell factors. Numerically, outliers are identified as data points
below Q1 – 1.5(Q3 – Q1) and above Q3 + 1.5(Q3 – Q1).

Let us consider the DINP structure
with dp = 50 nm and d = 30 nm. The corresponding
figure of merit (F0) as a function of t is presented in Figure 6b,d. What kind of actual Purcell factors (F) can be expected, given the randomness in the position of the color
center, and the randomness of the color center orientation? The result
of statistical analysis of F for the three different
scenarios, A, B, and C, are shown in Figure 9c. In this figure, the five-number summaries
are presented in the form of boxplots (see the inset in Figure 9c for information) as a function
of t.

Let us first take case A with the experimentally
feasible L3 cavities
(as considered in Figure 6d) and quantitatively examine F as a function
of t. When t = 0, the median of F is 0.5, and the maximum (excluding outliers) of F is 2.5. In all of the three configurations, the statistical
parameters increase as a function t and reach the
optimal value at the optimal depth, t = t0 (this trend and the value of the optimal depth are the
same as those for F0 in Figure 6). When t = to = 160, the median of F is
5.6 and the maximum is 35.5. The median of F at t = to for B and C is, respectively,
13.8 and 35.0. In ideal cavities, the statistical quantities are at
least larger than twofold of those in experimentally feasible cavities
(see Figure 9d).

Comparing configurations A and B, B produces a more consistent
Purcell factors (compare the length of the box in A and B which is
a sign of data consistency). In A, the axis orientation is quite critical.
As there is only one dipole in A, the misalignment of the dipole orientation
with respect to the cavity field strongly affects the Purcell factor.
This makes, the Purcell factor distributions for A to be skewed to
the right. On the other hand, in B, as there are two orthogonal dipoles,
when one dipole is completely misaligned with the orientation of the
electric field, there is another dipole perpendicular to it which
helps to elevate the Purcell factor. This makes the Purcell factor
distribution of B to be more symmetric and consistent compared to
that of A. Given the cons of A over B, there is one important advantage
in configuration A. That is, the maximum achievable Purcell factors
in A is always greater than those of B. The maximum Purcell enhancement
occurs when the dipoles are in parallel orientation with the electric
field direction. In B, there are two orthogonal dipoles of equal strength
and only one dipole can be maximally aligned with the electric field.
Thus, one dipole will have maximum enhancement, and the other will
be minimally enhanced.

In C, the dipoles are perfectly aligned
with the orientation of
the cavity field. Thus, the statistical parameters for configuration
C substantially outperform configurations A and B, where the dipole
orientations are random. The C scenario describes the distribution
in the Purcell factors solely because of the randomness in the color
center position within the interior of the nanodiamond. Although,
we have a perfect alignment in C, the Purcell factors still vary as
the electric field values vary from position to position in the interior
of the nanodiamond (see Figures 4 and 7c).

Table 1 displays
the numerical summaries (mean and median) of the Purcell factor distributions
for two important cases. The t = 0 case represents
the diamond on the surface of the cavity. The t = to = 160 nm represents the DINP structure at
its optimal pocket depth. The results are shown for all three configurations
of the dipole moments (A, B, and C) and for both experimentally feasible
L3 cavities and ideal L3 cavities. Remarkably, in all cases, the numerical
summaries for the DINP structure at its critical depth surpass the
diamond-on-surface case nearly by a factor of 10.

pocket depth. The results are shown for experimentally feasible L3
cavities (Expt) and ideal L3 cavities (ideal).

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have introduced a DINP structure as a new route
to achieve strong enhancements of light emission rates from the colors
centers of the nanodiamonds. The DINP structure consists of a nanopocket
and a nanodiamond. As an illustration, we incorporate the DINP structure
into a silicon nitride photonic crystal L3 cavity and show that the
accessible LDOS increases as a function of pocket depth. The LDOS
is maximized at a certain critical pocket depth and it is robust with
respect to perturbations in the shapes and orientations of the nanodiamond.

To analyze the feasible Purcell factors, we considered experimentally
feasible L3 cavities and performed statistical analysis, assuming
random positions and orientations of color centers within the nanodiamond.
Using appropriate dipole models of SiV and NV centers, we statistically
prove that the microcavity with DINP structures enables a significant
Purcell enhancement compared to the microcavity without the DINP structure.
