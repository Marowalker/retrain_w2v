Graphene oxide quantum
dot (GOQD) and reduced GOOD (rGOQD) were
synthetized using a simple and straight methodology based on an oxidative
treatment and sonication. GOQD and rGOQD were used as supporting agents
for the in situ generation of gold nanoparticles, avoiding the use
of additional stabilizers. GOQD resulted as a better support than
rGOQD because of the presence of higher functional groups that can
interact with gold. Theoretical studies through density functional
theory revealed the important role of the epoxy groups of GOQD on
the stabilization of gold. GOQD and GOQD-Au were tested for the first
time as catalysts for the decomposition of solid composite propellants.
GOQD not only lowered the decomposition temperature of ammonium perchlorate
(AP) but also enhanced the exothermic heat of AP, in comparison to
graphene and GO. GOQD-Au increased the energy release; however, the
effect on the decrease of the decomposition temperature of AP was
not as significant as other previous reported catalysts.

1 Introduction
During
the last century, the development of commercial and military
applications of rocketry has fomented advancements in rocket science.
High-energy materials are most important ingredients to provide the
driving force to escape Earth’s gravity. Among these materials,
propellants are commonly used as the energy source for the propulsion
of solid rocket motors.1 Propellants are
defined as a combustible material that burns slowly, in a controlled
manner, propelling a projectile, such as a missile, a rocket, or a
space launch vehicle.2 For space exploration
and military applications, both solid and liquid propellants are used.
However, for safety reasons, reliability, simplicity, and long storage
life, solid propellants are preferred over liquid propellants.3 Heterogeneous propellants are mainly represented
by composite solid propellants, which are the major source of chemical
energy in modern space vehicles and missiles. Composite solid propellants
are essentially made up of three basic components: a binder, an oxygen-rich
solid oxidizer, and a combustible metal additive.4 The oxidizer is the source of oxygen and the major component
of the composite solid propellant. Ammonium perchlorate (AP) is the
most common oxidizer because of its excellent properties such as high
oxygen content, high density, high specific volume of combustion products,
good stability in storage and use, and low price.5 One important factor in the general performance of composite
solid propellants is the decomposition temperature, which is directly
related to the chemical properties of AP. Generally speaking, the
lower the decomposition temperature of AP, the shorter the delay time
of propellant ignition and thus the higher the combustion rate and
the better the performance of the composite solid propellants. The
lower the decomposition temperature of AP, the higher will be the
burn rate of the propellant. Evidence has shown that the final decomposition
temperature and the burn rate of composite solid propellants can be
easily tuned by adding a burn rate catalyst.6 Currently, burn rate catalysts include mainly transition-metal oxides,7−11 metal nanoparticles (NPs),12−15 and ferrocene derivatives.16,17 However, most of them are not able to increase the decomposition
rate and energy release significantly or require difficult and expensive
synthesis paths.

In the search of new catalysts, Sabourin and
co-workers18 assayed graphene to improve
the combustion performance
of composite solid propellants. Their work highlighted the role of
graphene in increasing the burn rate of the propellants, which not
only catalyzes fuel combustion reactions but also participates energetically
and is consumed without producing residual particulates. Graphene
oxide (GO), which consists of defect-rich graphene and residual chemisorbed
oxygen-containing moieties,19 provides
a less expensive alternative to high-purity graphene and may be equally
effective for propellant applications. The positive effects of GO
on energetic materials mainly rely on its high thermal20 and electrical conductivity21,22 and large specific surface area,23 which
influence the high-temperature decomposition (HTD) and low-temperature
decomposition (LTD) steps of AP, accelerating the electron transfer
and thus speeding up its decomposition. GO can also act as the support
and stabilizer of metal NPs, such as Fe2O3 and
Mn3O4, enhancing their catalytic activities
for the decomposition of AP.24,25 In the case of supported
Mn3O4, a 5 wt % of the composite reduced the
HTD of AP by 142 °C, which is one of the best decreases reported
to date. GO sheets have also been successfully applied for the catalysis
of the reduction of iron(III).26

Graphene quantum dots (GRQDs) have attracted increasing attention
in nanoscience and nanotechnology because of their remarkable properties,
such as high surface area, excellent solubility, low cytotoxicity,
stable fluorescence, and an adjustable band gap.27 At present, a variety of methods have been developed to
prepare GRQDs. The most common is cutting GO28 because of its low cost, easy processing, and mass production, resulting
in GO quantum dots (GOQDs),29 which can
be further functionalized or reduced to produce reduced GOQDs (rGOQDs).
Most of the GRQD synthesis involves hydrothermal,30,31 solvothermal,28 or microwave-assisted32 paths that require several hours of reaction
or expensive apparatus. More recently, Zhu and co-workers reported
a highly efficient, simple, and fast ultrasonic strategy to synthesize
GRQD from GO.33

GOQD and GRQD have
been reported as the support for the synthesis
of metal NPs. Silver,34,35 copper,36 iron,37 and palladium38 NPs have been successfully produced by the in situ reduction
of cations previously stabilized by GOQD or GRQD. GRQDs conjugating
with gold NPs (AuNPs) have also been described for the modification
of electrode conductivity39 and as the
catalyst for vapor deposition growth.40 However, both methodologies referred to the use of graphene derivatives
only as the support of previously stabilized AuNPs by cysteamine or
a silicon substrate as the pattern. To date, most of the studies do
not refer to the use of GOQD as the direct stabilizer of AuNPs. Wu
et al. reported in 2015 the effective in situ synthesis of AuNPs supported
on GRQD to catalyze the oxidation of veratryl alcohol.41 However, the use of GOQD as the stabilizer has
not been reported. Moreover, to our knowledge, neither GOQDs nor AuNPs
have been tested as the catalyst for the decomposition of AP, the
latter probably due to its elevated cost. Therefore, in this paper,
we report the in situ synthesis and characterization of AuNPs supported
on GOQD and rGOQD and their further use as catalysts for the decomposition
of AP. Graphene derivatives were obtained using a simple and direct
oxidative methodology based on sonication, avoiding the use of expensive
apparatus. GOQD increased the performance of solid composite propellants
because of its improved heat transfer, higher thermal conductivity,
and catalytic decomposition of AP. The interaction between GOQD and
gold was also analyzed through ab initio calculations, revealing the
important role of epoxy groups on the surface of the layer for the
stabilization of the metal.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of GO, GOQD, and rGOQD
A Jasco FT/IR 4100
spectrometer was used to measure Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra in the 500–4000 cm–1 frequency range. A Jasco V-630 UV–visible
spectrophotometer was used to measure the UV–visible spectra.
All measurements were performed at room temperature. The FT-IR spectra
of graphite and GO are shown in Figure 1a. The GO spectrum shows oxygen functionalities at
1054 (C–O stretching vibrations), 1728 (C=O stretching
vibrations), and 3400 cm–1 (O–H stretching
vibrations), supporting the effective oxidation of graphite to GO.

Figure 1 (a) FT-IR
spectra of graphite and GO, (b) attenuated total reflection
(ATR)–IR spectra of GOQD and rGOQD, and (c) UV–vis spectra
of GO, GOQD, and rGOQD.

Skeletal vibrations of C=C from unoxidized graphitic
diamonds
appeared at 1622 cm–1. The pure graphite spectrum
shows broad absorption bands at 1040 and 3440 cm–1 corresponding to the stretching vibrations of C–O and O–H,
respectively.42 The 1640 cm–1 absorption peak was attributed to the skeletal vibrations of C=C.43 The spectra of GO and graphite are quite different;
the GO spectra show fewer oxygen-containing functional groups, confirming
the successful oxidation of graphite.

The as-obtained GO was
submitted to an oxidative treatment using
ultrasonic waves. It is known that the ultrasound can lead to the
formation and collapse of small vacuum bubbles.44 The energy of ultrasonic waves cuts GO sheets into GOQDs.
In this work, no microwave-assisted synthesis was applied, avoiding
the necessity of costly apparatus or long hydrothermal treatments.30,32 The resulting GOQD can be dispersed in water without further sonication.
As shown in Figure 1b, the ATR–IR spectrum of GOQD exhibits a C–O stretching
peak at approx. 1000 cm–1, a C–H stretching
peak at ca. 1335 cm–1, and a broad O–H stretching
peak at 3400 cm–1. After reduction, the rGOQD presents
a reduction in the C–O signal because of deoxygenation.45,46

All samples were prepared, and UV–visible spectra were
recorded.
As depicted in Figure 1c, the GO UV–vis spectrum (0.1 mg/mL in water) shows two bands:
a shoulder at approximately 310 nm, corresponding to the n/π*
transition of C=O bonds, and a maximum at 230 nm, which can
be assigned to the π/π* transition of aromatic C=C
bonds.47 GOQD in water shows an absorption
band at approximately 296 nm48 because
of the absorption of the graphitic structure, similar to GO. The weak
shoulder at 344 nm is related to the n/π* transition.34 In the case of rGOQD, this band disappeared,
which is related to the lower level of oxidation in the structure.
The absorbance peak in rGOQD slightly red-shifted to 293 nm, while
the absorbance value increased in comparison to that of GOQD, suggesting
that the electronic conjugation is restored after reduction.49

To further explore the optical characteristics
of the as-prepared
GOQD and rGOQD, a photoluminescence (PL) study was carried out by
using different excitation wavelengths. The spectra of most luminescent
carbon materials are dependent on the excitation wavelength. In this
work, as shown in Figure 2, the position of the PL spectral peaks remained almost invariable
as the excitation wavelength increased, indicating an excitation-independent
PL feature. GOQD presented a maximum PL peak at 430 nm with an excitation
wavelength of 270 nm, whereas rGOQD exhibited a peak at 470 nm at
the same excitation value. The fluorescence of these materials may
originate from emissive free zigzag sites with a carbene triplet ground
state.50,51

Figure 2 PL of (a) GOQD and (b) rGOQD at different excitation
wavelengths.

The size of the GOQD
was assessed by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (Figure S1). The average diameter
of the obtained QDs was 17.7 nm, which is larger in comparison to
the other reported synthesis with the 3–5 nm diameter.48 The higher diameter value is probably related
to the application of lower temperature and no microwave equipment,
resulting in lower energy during the GO cleavage process and thus
larger GO fragments.

2.2 AuNPs Supported on GOQD
and rGOQD
The resulting GOQD and rGOQD were used as the support
for the in
situ synthesis of AuNPs. Most of the studies report the synthesis
of AuNPs by using an additional stabilizing agent such as cysteamine39 or a silicon substrate as the pattern.40 As shown in Figure 3, different concentrations of HAuCl4 were assessed. With both substrates, a broad and intense band was
observed at approximately 540 nm, characteristic of zero-valent gold
particles.52,53

Figure 3 UV–vis spectra of (a) GOQD-Au and
(b) rGOQD-Au at different
ratios and (c) comparison of both peaks obtained with a concentration
of 0.3 mM HAuCl4.

Both GOQD and rGOQD resulted as adequate stabilizers for
the synthesis
of AuNPs. As the amount of HAuCl4 increased, the intensity
of the Au0 band decreased, related to the maximum concentration
of gold that can be correctly stabilized by the functional groups
of the QDs.

Figure 3c presents
a comparison of the peaks obtained by using each QD as the support
at the lower gold concentration, 0.3 mM. As can be seen, GOQD showed
a higher intensity, related to the presence of a greater amount of
functional groups such as epoxy, carboxylic acids, or alcohols, which
can interact with gold atoms and generate more stable complexes. In
this way, the GOQD system resulted as a more efficient support for
the stabilization of AuNPs. Figure S2 shows
the ATR–IR spectra of GOQD-Au. The oxygen-containing functional
groups are present but with less intensity compared to GOQD because
of the reductive effect of sodium citrate in the experimental procedure.
These electron-rich sites effectively stabilized AuNPs, prevented
the agglomeration, and resulted in higher stability than sole AuNPs
in water.26 The coordination sites of GOQD
and the affinity to gold were explored using computational tools and
will be further discussed in the next section.

The GOQD-Au sample
at the lower concentration of gold was characterized
by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM). Figure 4 depicts the analysis
of diameter distribution and the obtained microphotographs. Two main
sizes were identified, in an average of 9 and 35 nm, with a higher
prevalence of the smaller diameters. The wide distribution is probably
connected to the low monodispersity of the GOQD sample. Low size NPs
can be effectively stabilized by the 17 nm GOQD; however, bigger sizes
such as 35 nm require a sphere of GOQD to achieve the correct protection
and stabilization.

Figure 4 Size distribution analysis and SEM images of the AuNPs
synthetized
using GOQD as the supporting agent, with the lower concentration of
gold (0.3 mM).

GOQD and GOQD-Au were
also electrochemically characterized. Each
glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with 5 μL of the
GOQD and GOQD-Au (HAuCl4 0.3 mM), respectively, and dried
at room temperature. As shown in Figure S3, GOQD reduces the conductivity of the electrode surface, related
to the lower current intensity recorded by cyclic voltammetry and
the upper semicircle radius of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS), agreeing with previous studies reporting much slower electron-transfer
rate for GRQDs.54 In the case of GOQD-Au,
the presence of gold decreases the resistance of GOQD, improving the
modified GCE response to the Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox couple. GOQDs are
not suitable for applying to a beneficial single electrode material,
but the presence of AuNPs in GOQD-Au exhibits great potential.

2.3 Computational Description of GOQD-Au
Considering that
GOQD resulted as the better support for the synthesis
of AuNPs than rGOQD, the isolated GOQD structure was fully optimized
at the B3LYP/6-311G level and used as the reference for the calculation
of basis set superposition error (BSSE)-corrected interaction energy
(Eint). It is well-known that GO has some
functional groups such as carboxylic acids, ethoxy, and alcohols that
can stabilize metal ions. The oxidative-ultrasonic methodology applied
in this work induced the doping of nitrogen into GOQD through nitration.55,56Figure 5a shows the
optimized GOQD geometry, including oxygen- and nitrogen-derived functional
groups according to the literature.32 These
potential coordination sites with high electron density, where a metal
ion could be attached and generate complexes, were considered for
the binding analysis.

and the
six possible coordination sites, (b) most stable GOQD-Au8 complex (f), natural population analysis (NPA) charges (a.u.) for
the selected atoms are displayed in italics, and bond lengths are
given in angstrom. (c) Energy of the Fermi level calculated for GOQD
(—) and the most stable complexes of GOQD-Au (—).

The Au8 cluster was
placed near to the electron-rich
sites of the GOQD structure to generate the starting geometries of
GOQD-Au8 complexes for optimization. Six different coordination
sites were selected (Figure 5a): the gold cluster interacting with (a) the carboxylic acid
group (−COOH), (b) the hydroxyl group (−OH) at the edges
of the GOQD layer, (c) the −N– group at the aromatic
rings, (d) the double −N– groups belonging to the aromatic
rings on the center of the structure, (e) the double coordination
to −N– at the edge site, and (f) the epoxy groups (−O−)
on the GOQD layer. In order to search for alternative local minima,
three initial conformations were tested at each coordination site. Table 1 lists the most stable Eint at the selected coordination sites, distances
between the Au8 cluster and the anchor atom, and the charge
for the optimized complexes.

and -uncorrected (in parenthesis) interaction energy (Eint, kcal·mol–1) for the studied
complexes. EFL corresponds to the Fermi
level in electronvolt.

The Eint analysis indicated that the
most stable rGOQD-Au8 complexes corresponded to site (f)
(Figure 5b) and then
complexes (c) and (d). Figure S4 shows
the optimized geometry of all complexes, in which bond lengths and
natural bond order charges at selected atomic sites were depicted.
The only complex that did not show stable geometries at the original
coordination site was complex (d), where the coordination to −N–
atoms at the center of the aromatic rings was not favorable, preferring
the coordination to the epoxy groups on the surface of the GOQD layer.
Moreover, the final optimized structure (d) was the only complex showing
double coordination to an oxygen atom (Figure S4). In comparison to structure (f), the complex (d) was approx.
30 kcal·mol–1 less stable, related to the double
coordination that strained the cluster structure. This fact is supported
by the longer average bond distances of the gold cluster in structure
(d), which presented a deviation from the original structure of Au8 in approx. 3%, and a much longer distance between both anchored
gold atoms, which separated from 2.78 to 3.1 Å.

On the
other hand, system (f) was approximately 25 kcal·mol–1 more stable than (c), indicating that the gold nanocluster
improved the delocalization of the electronic charge around GOQD rings.
Complex (f) also presented the shorter anchor bond distance (dX–Au) of the set, associated with stronger
interaction and stability. The total NPA charge of the gold cluster
(Δqcluster) was also analyzed. In
all cases, the ligand (GOQD) transferred part of its charge to the
cluster. Complex (f) presented the greatest amount of transferred
electron density, with approximately 70% more transferred charge than
complex (b), the less stable of the series.

Figure S5 shows the electrostatic potential
surface and frontier molecular orbitals of the optimized structure
of GOQD. As can be seen, most of the electronic density is situated
at the epoxy functional groups, specifically at the oxygen atoms.
This evidence indicates that the lone pairs belonging to these atoms
are highly available for the interaction with metal atoms. Therefore,
AuNPs will tend to grow close to the epoxy groups on the surface of
the GOQD layer rather than the functional groups located at the edge
sites, as demonstrated by the Ebind analysis,
where complex (f) was the most stable. Taking into account the average
size of the synthetized GOQD (17.7 nm), it is possible to state that
the smaller NPs of 9 nm can be effectively stabilized by the epoxy
groups on the surface of a single GOQD, whereas the bigger NPs of
approx. 35 nm require a sphere of GOQD interacting with the metal
atoms through the different functional sites. As revealed by computational
calculations, oxygen-containing groups result as better stabilizers
than the nitrogen-rich groups.

With the aim of exploring the
effect of gold on the conductivity
of GOQD, the energy of the Fermi level (EFL) was calculated for all complexes, GOQD, and the gold cluster (Table 1). GOQD presents a
value of −3.69 eV and Au8 −5.06 eV. This
indicates that the cluster is a better conductor than GOQD. As shown
in Figure 5c, the coordination
of the Au cluster to GOQD lowered the EFL in both complexes (f) and (c), indicating a higher conductivity.
The decrease of EFL in GOQD-Au can be
related with the cyclic voltammetry results (Figure S3) that showed higher current intensities for GOQD-Au, indicating
an easier oxidation of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox couple because of
the better conductivity of GOQD-Au.

2.4 Application
as Propellant Catalysts
The synthetized systems were evaluated
as catalysts for the decomposition
of AP, the main component of composite solid propellants. With the
aim of comparing the effect of AuNPs and GOQD-Au on the decomposition
of AP, 13 nm AuNPs were synthetized following the traditional sodium
citrate procedure.57 Because the thermal
decomposition of AP involves electronic transfers, the introduction
of an electron transport agent could facilitate and accelerate the
decomposition reaction of AP. In this sense, it has been reported
that GR and GO derivatives are capable of constructing a conductive
network that facilitates the heat and electron transfers during fuel
decomposition, resulting in improved energy release and decomposition
of AP.58,59 Moreover, nanocomposites of GO and Al@Fe2O3 also provide a pathway for electrostatic discharges,
improving the overall safety.59 GR and
GO have also been mixed with NPs such as cobalt and iron,25,60 resulting in a decrease in the higher decomposition temperature
of AP. To our knowledge, both GOQD and gold have never been tested
as the catalyst for the decomposition of AP, the latter probably due
to its elevated cost. GOQD and GOQD-Au synthetized at the lower HAuCl4 concentration (0.3 mM) were tested as catalysts for the decomposition
of AP at 4 wt %. The same concentration and weight percentage were
used for AuNPs. Figure 6 shows the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves for pure
AP and the tested materials.

Figure 6 (a) DSC curves for the thermal decomposition
of pure AP and AP
with 4 wt % of GOQD, GOQD-Au, and AuNP and (b) summary of the effect
of GR or GO derivatives on the HTD of AP.

AP shows the classical first endothermic peak corresponding
to
the crystal phase transition from orthorhombic to cubic phase (240–250
°C).61 After that, the exothermic
LTD and sublimation take place at approx. 300 °C with a proton
transfer, which is the most accepted mechanism.62 Finally, the HTD (415 °C) step occurs.

When
GOQD is mixed with AP at 4 wt %, the first endothermic transition
of AP occurs at lower temperature. A second endothermic peak is registered
because of the decomposition of GOQD. The exothermic LTD peak was
shifted to lower temperature (293 °C), whereas the HTD peak occurred
at 392 °C, 23 °C before pure AP. Dey and co-workers63 evaluated GR as the catalyst for the decomposition
of AP with a 5 wt %, registering a first exothermic peak at 368 °C
and a HTD process at 395 °C. Zhao et al. tested GO at 2 wt %,
observing two peaks for the LTD and HTD at 345 and 430 °C, respectively.60 A study of Memon and co-workers58 reported that fast crash AP with hand-mixed GO decreased
the second decomposition temperature of AP from 435 to 409 °C,
whereas fast crash AP and GO reduced the final decomposition temperature
to 403 °C. These previous results confirm that GOQD exhibits
better performance as the catalyst for the decomposition of AP than
GO and GR. Both exothermic decomposition processes of AP + GOQD resulted
in lower temperatures, indicating that GOQD accelerated the electrons
to speed up the decomposition of AP. Figure 6b summarizes the effect of graphene or GO
derivatives on the HTD of AP.

The 13 nm AuNPs synthetized by
the traditional methodology were
also tested. The LTD appeared at higher temperature in comparison
to AP (approx. 329 °C). The DSC profile was similar to the one
recorded for AP, with very close HDT.

GOQD-Au, as AuNP, shifted
the first endothermic process to higher
temperature. The LTD started at an upper temperature than AP and AP
+ GOQD (approx. 325 °C) and was almost in the middle temperature
between AuNP and GOQD. The LTD and HTD merged into one step, the proton-
and electron- transfer routes occurred in a single and continuous
process. This result suggests a synergic effect of GOQD and AuNP,
which participate actively in the mechanism of decomposition of AP,
facilitating the electron transfer. It is well-known that the size
of the catalysts affects the final decomposition of AP.64 Unlike the AuNP sample, GOQD-Au presented high
dispersity of NP sizes, mainly 9 and 35 nm. This heterogeneous mixture
can be related to the observed continuity of the HDT process. The
AP + GOQD-Au high-temperature peak (371 °C) appeared at lower
temperature than AP + GOQD (392 °C) and AP + AuNP (406 °C),
close to the performance exhibited by a graphene–iron oxide
nanocomposite 1 wt %, which presented a second decomposition temperature
of approx. 372 °C.63 However, this
change was lower than the decrease registered by other metal NP catalysts
supported on graphene derivatives, such as ultrafine Mn3O4 NPs dispersed on graphene, which decreased the second
peak temperature to 291 °C24 or 2
wt % GO/Co3O4, which lowered the HTD of AP to
297 °C.60

When the energy release
is analyzed, it can be noted that GOQD
(1305 W·g–1) released a higher amount than
pure AP (1016 W·g–1) and also in comparison
to the value reported previously for GO at 2 wt % (1215 W·g–1).60 GOQD not only lowers
the decomposition temperature but also enhances the exothermic heat
of AP. The AuNP released approx. 40% more energy (1471 W·g–1) than pure AP. However, the HDT was not effectively
reduced, resulting as an unsuitable catalyst to accelerate the decomposition
of AP. GOQD-Au released 80% more energy than AP (1806 W·g–1), a value approx. 200 W·g–1 bigger than GO/Co3O4 at 2 wt %.60 Although the energy release was bigger than
that of other systems, the effect on the decrease of the HDT was not
as successful as other reported metal catalysts supported on graphene
derivatives (Figure 6b). Therefore, the results obtained in this study suggest that GOQD
is a promising material for increasing the performance of solid composite
propellants because of its improved heat transfer, higher thermal
conductivity, and catalytic decomposition of AP. The presence of a
larger quantity of functional groups on the edges of the QDs than
GO can be related to the superior performance of this material in
the decomposition of AP, which increases the electron-transfer rate
and at the same time serve as the fuel. Probably, the synthesis of
new NPs supported on QDs will produce even better catalytic properties
and will be considered in the future work.

3 Conclusions
In this work, the synthesis of GOQD and rGOQD was performed by
the oxidation and sonication of GO. The experimental characterization
confirmed the effective cut of GO into small layers, which exhibited
excitation-independent PL feature. GOQD and rGOQD were applied as
the support and stabilizing agents for the in situ synthesis of AuNPs.
GOQD resulted as a better substrate because of the presence of a higher
amount of functional groups that can interact and bind to gold. Computational
calculations highlighted the key role of the epoxy groups on the surface
of the GOQD layer in the stabilization of AuNPs. Electrochemical measurements
revealed the lower conductivity of GOQD in comparison to that of GOQD-Au,
a property that was correlated with the higher energy of the Fermi
level of GOQD. DSC assays confirmed better performance of GOQD as
the catalyst for the decomposition of AP than that of GO and GR. GOQD
not only lowered the decomposition temperature but also enhanced the
exothermic heat of AP. GOQD-Au merged the LTD and HTD into one step,
the proton- and electron-transfer routes occurred in a single process,
suggesting an active participation of gold and GOQD on the decomposition
mechanism of AP. Although the energy release of GOQD-Au + AP was bigger
than that of GOQD + AP, the effect on the decrease of the HDT was
not as important as other previous reported metal catalysts supported
on graphene derivatives. The results obtained in this work suggest
that GOQD is a promising material for increasing the performance of
solid composite propellants. Future work will consider the synthesis
of new NPs supported on QDs to produce enhanced catalytic properties.

available purity and were used as received. KBr, graphite, H2SO4, K2S2O8, KMnO4, H2O2, HNO3, NaOH, NaBH4, sodium citrate, KCl, K3[Fe(CN)6],
and K4[Fe(CN)6] were acquired from Merck. Phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) was acquired from Medicago. P2O5 and HAuCl4·3H2O were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich.
All solutions, including the ones used in electrochemical measurements,
were prepared with in-house produced ultrapure water with resistivity
less than 18 MΩ cm (Milli-Q, USA).

A Jasco FT/IR 4100
spectrometer was used for measuring FT-IR spectra, using the 500–4000
cm–1 frequency range, on the KBr pellet. A Jasco
V-630 UV–visible spectrophotometer was used for measuring the
UV–visible spectra. All measurements were completed at room
temperature. HR-SEM and HR-TEM were carried out using a FEI INSPECT-F50
and a Tecnai ST F20 FEI equipment, respectively. PL measurements were
taken with a Jasco spectrophotometer FP-8200. DSC analysis was performed
on an 822e Mettler Toledo instrument at a heating rate of 5 °C·min–1 under a nitrogen blanket in the range of 140–500
°C. To investigate the catalytic performance of the compounds
for the thermal decomposition of AP, specific amounts of the complexes
and AP were mixed and ground in a certain weight ratio for the DSC
analysis.

4.2 Synthesis of GO
GO was synthetized
using the modified Hummers method.65 Shortly,
graphite powder (4 g) was dissolved in H2SO4 (10 mL), heated (90 °C) with vigorous stirring, and then preoxidized
using K2S2O8 and P2O5 (2 g each). The solution reacted under stirring (4 h) at
high temperature (80 °C). Then, Milli-Q water (500 mL) was added,
and the solution was stirred overnight. The preoxidized graphite was
filtered and washed (deionized water) until reaching neutral pH and
then dried at room temperature overnight. This powder was oxidized
even more with H2SO4 (92 mL) and KMnO4 (12 g) in an ice bath and then stirred (2 h) at 35 °C. Then,
Milli-Q water (184 mL) was added. The reaction was terminated, reducing
the manganese in the solution, by adding H2O2 (10 mL) and Milli-Q water (560 mL). The solution turned bright yellow
and was stirred overnight. GO was centrifuged (3000 rpm) and washed
(deionized water) until reaching neutral pH. Then, it was vacuum-dried
at 30 °C.

4.3 Synthesis of GOQDs, rGOQDs,
and AuNPs Supported
on GOQD (GOQD-Au) and rGOQD (rGOQD-Au)
GOQDs were prepared
following the procedure reported by Li and co-workers with some modifications.32 Briefly, 0.05 g of GO was suspended in 40 mL
of concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid (1:3 ratio). The mixture
was stirred for 24 h and then sonicated for 24 h. The mixture was
cooled and diluted with deionized water (20 mL). The pH of the resulting
dark brown solution was adjusted by adding the concentrated solution
of NaOH until reaching pH 8, avoiding temperatures higher than 80
°C. The resulting mixture was filtered through a microporous
membrane (0.22 μm), obtaining a yellowish solution. The liquid
excess was evaporated by a rotary evaporator. The concentrated solution
was dialyzed five times using a 3500 Da dialysis bag. The resulting
solution corresponded to GOQDs. rGOQDs were prepared by mixing 5 mL
of GOQD with 1 g of NaBH4 to reduce the functional groups.
This solution was filtrated through a microporous membrane (0.22 μm)
and further dialyzed using a 3500 Da dialysis bag.

The GOQD
and rGOQD solutions (0.1 mL) were mixed with 0.1 mL of HAuCl4 of different concentrations: 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 mM. After
15 min agitation, a 0.1 mL sodium citrate solution (0.1 mM) was added
as the reducing agent and sonicated for 5 min. A red-pink solution
was obtained after sonication, related to the formation of the NPs.

4.4 Electrochemical Methods and Characterization
The electrochemical properties of the samples were measured using
a potentiostat–galvanostat electrochemical workstation (CH
Instruments, CHI 760E) at room temperature (20 °C). All measurements
were performed in a common three-compartment cell. A platinum (Pt)
disk electrode (2 mm diameter) was used as the working electrode.
A coiled Pt wire of large area was used as the counter electrode,
and it was separated from the electrolytic solution in all time by
a sintered glass frit. All potentials are referred to as Ag/AgCl (KCl,
1 M) electrode. Prior to each experiment, the Pt disk electrode was
polished to a mirror finish with an alumina slurry (particle sizes
0.3 and 0.05 μm) on microcloth pads, rinsed exhaustively with
Milli-Q water, and dried. Also, prior to each experiment, the working
solution was purged for 15 min with high-purity argon, and a reduced
flow was maintained during the measurements. Cyclic voltammetry characterization
profiles were performed in 0.2 M PBS, 0.5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6], and 0.5 mM K4[Fe(CN)6] in an electrochemical
window of −0.2 to +0.6 V. EIS was performed in the same solution
at a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1000 kHz and at an ac voltage
amplitude of 0.01 V at open-circuit potential.

4.5 Computational
Details
The nanoarchitecture
of GOQD and GOQD-Au was explored by theoretical methodologies. Because
of the size of the system, the GOQD layer was represented by a 2 ×
2 nm2 structure. The functional groups were distributed
in accordance with previous experimental results.32 It is well-known that GO has some functional groups such
as carboxylic acids, ethoxy, and alcohols that can stabilize metal
ions. The oxidative-ultrasonic methodology applied in this work induced
the doping of nitrogen into GOQD through nitration.55,56 The geometry of GOQD was fully optimized at the density functional
theory level using the Gaussian 16 software.66 AuNPs were represented by an eight-atom cluster (Au8).
In order to understand the interaction between GOQDs and AuNPs, all
complexes were fully optimized using the Becke’s three-parameter
nonlocal hybrid exchange potential with the nonlocal correlation functional
of Lee, Yang, and Parr (B3LYP).67−69 No symmetry restrictions were
applied. Light atoms, such as C, H, O, and N, were described with
the triple-ζ 6-311G(d,p) basis set, whereas gold atoms were
described with a relativistic effective core potential basis set with
pseudopotentials (LANL2DZ70). A tight self-consistent
field convergence criterion (10–8 a.u.) was used
in all calculations. The charge distribution of intermolecular interactions
was calculated by the NPA method,71 as
implemented in Gaussian 16. The interaction energy (Eint) was defined according to the following expression: Eint = EGOQD-Au8 – EGOQD(GOQD-Au8) – EAu8(GOQD-Au), which represents the energy
difference between the complex and the energies of constituent monomers.
It is well-known that the estimation of Eint with finite basis sets introduces an error known as BSSE. The BSSE
is related to the use of different numbers of basic functions to describe
the complex and monomers for the same basis set. BSSE-corrected interaction
energies were computed using the Boys–Bernardi counterpoise
correction scheme.72 The effect on the
conductivity of the coordination of gold to GOQDs was estimated by
the energy of the Fermi level (EFL), which
corresponds to the average of the highest occupied molecular orbital
and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies.
