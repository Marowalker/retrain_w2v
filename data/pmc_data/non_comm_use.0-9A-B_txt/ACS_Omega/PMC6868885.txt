This
paper proposes a new paradigm in polymer light-emitting diode
(PLED) fabrication by using a uniform electrosprayed microparticle
film as the active layer. Among the seven electrospraying parameters
analyzed, three crucial parameters are statistically identified and
optimized to obtain thin electrosprayed microparticle layers. Using
optimized electrospraying conditions, single-color red-emitting PLED
(MEH-PPV) with a peak current density of 16.1 mA/mm2 under
a 13.5 V bias and a peak external quantum efficiency of 3.2% are successfully
fabricated. Finally, a combinatorial approach is implemented using
both MEH-PPV (red-emitting) and F8BT (green-emitting) polymer microparticles
at different mixing ratios to tune the emission spectrum of the devices.
As such, it has been demonstrated that hybrid multilayer films using
different organic materials with nonorthogonal solvents can be produced
using this new approach. The parameter analysis and color-tunable
properties pave the way towards white light PLED fabrication.

Introduction
Polymer light-emitting
diodes (PLEDs) have generated a widespread
interest in both academic and industrial research towards new generations
of low-cost solid-state lighting devices and flat panel displays,
mainly because of their unique advantages including flexibility, large-area
scalability, and low-cost solution-based fabrication.1,2 Except for spin-coating, liquid fabrication methods for polymeric
materials generally offer the advantages of low-cost and low-temperature
processing with high material yield.3 As
a result, multiple light-emitting polymer systems were proposed since
the first reports on the poly-phenylenevinylene (PPV)-based PLED nearly
three decades ago.4 More recently, light-emitting
polymer systems including the poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]
or MEH-PPV,5−7 the poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) or F8BT,8−10 and the poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene)
or PFO11,12 acting as efficient red-, green-, and blue-emitting
polymers, respectively13 are developed,
and full color displays have also been realized by combining red-,
green-, and blue-emitting polymers.14−16

However, a multilayer
architecture is usually necessary to fulfill
the PLED’s potential for high thermal-stability, long operation
lifetime, and high efficiency.17 Typically,
such devices combine a hole-injection layer, a hole-transporting layer,
an emissive layer, and an electron-transporting layer.18 Most unfortunately, the similar solubility of
conjugated polymers in common organic solvents generates great challenges
when fabricating these multilayer PLED devices. As a result, the underlying
film is often partially dissolved and blended with the newly deposited
material during multilayer deposition yielding lower performances
for both materials.19 While some multilayer
PLED architectures have been successfully fabricated using a liquid
buffer layer,14,20,21 the number of layers remains greatly limited because very few solvents
can be used orthogonally to dissolve common PLED materials.17

Since the first reports over a century
ago,22 electrospraying processes are now
ubiquitous for the deposition
of polymers,23 semi-conductive ceramics,24 and biological materials.25,26 It relies on liquid atomization using electrostatic forces to break
the surface tension when a solution flows through a needle under high
electrical potential.27 In the process
of reaching the electrically grounded collector, fast solvent evaporation
results in the collection of particles. Compared to other techniques,
electrospraying has the advantage of a very simple architecture setup
with low material consumption for a wide selection of precursor viscosities.28,29 As a result, the use of electrospraying can lead to the formation
of nano- to sub-micrometer polymeric structures offering limitless
possibilities for new materials and technologies targeting micro-electronics
and medical devices.30,31 Additionally, electrospraying
has been recently applied to fabricating organic photovoltaic devices32,33 and organic light-emitting diode devices.28,34−36

In this work, we exploit electrospraying techniques
in order to
achieve facile one-step PLED device fabrication using a uniform layer
of conjugated polymer microparticles as the active region. To do so,
the morphology of the microparticle layer is studied while varying
several process parameters including flow rate, applied voltage, the
distance between the tip of the needle and collector, the gauge of
the needle, ambient temperature, deposition time, and concentration
of the polymer solution. Subsequently, a statistical design of experiment
approach reveals the key parameters affecting the thickness of the
microparticle layer in order to allow precise control and optimization.
These optimized parameters are first used to achieve a red-emitting
PLED device using a uniform film of MEH-PPV microdroplets. Finally,
a combinatorial approach using two different conjugated polymer microparticles
(MEH-PPV and F8BT) at different ratios demonstrates the ability to
combine materials and tune the emission properties of the PLED devices
while maintaining the simplicity of the fabrication process.

Results
and Discussions
Among many different electrospraying modes,
cone-jet mode is the
most important and widely used since it provides the best stability
and reproducibility during the electrospraying process.25 Because of the relatively low carrier mobility
in conjugated polymers, the thickness of the electrosprayed microparticle
layer is critical for the input power of the PLED devices.9 The particle size can be affected by many exogenous
variables, and the key process parameters can be identified through
a randomized control experiment. In Figure 1a, the average particle size in the film
is ranging from 5.4 to 7.4 μm in the y-axis,
and the values for each process parameter are shown in Table 1. The low and high values are
selected based on the observation of cone-jet mode. Figure 1a shows a graphic representation
of the interrelation between the key experimental parameters and the
size of the electrosprayed F8BT microparticles, where long lines indicate
the corresponding parameters with the greater impacts, while the shorter
lines indicate otherwise. In addition, the sign of the slope indicates
if the average particle size is directly or inversely proportional
to the given parameter variation. It suggests that the distance between
the needle and the collector, the needle gauge, and the polymer solution
concentration are the key parameters with the greatest impact on the
average particle size. The distance between the needle and the collector
and applied voltage have a tight interwined relationship to the electrical
field, a crucial parameter in electrospraying. At a given voltage,
a smaller distance has the advantage of high electrical field generation
and smaller particles collection; however, aggregation of wet particles
on the collector may happen because of insufficient time for solvent
evaporation. On the contrary, a larger distance would require higher
voltage applied and cause the lost electrosprayed materials to the
surroundings. Because the selected experimental low and high values
with the cone-jet mode, a 50% difference in distance (10 and 15 cm)
is larger than 20% difference in the voltage supplied (8 and 10 kV)
results in a greater impact of the distance comparing to applied voltage.
The gauge of needle controls the size of the jetting cone under cone-jet
mode. A smaller particle collection would prefer a larger needle gauge
and a smaller diameter of the needle. Solution concentration controls
the quantity of the polymer material itself and affects the solution’s
electrical conductivity and viscosity. Because all the electrosprayed
polymers are semi-conductive, the concentration selected has little
impact on the conductivity. The polymeric solution also shows no significant
viscosity changes with selected values. Therefore, a smaller concentration
is preferred to collect smaller particles because of less polymer
quantity. Figure 1b
shows a typical 3D scan used to assess the distribution of the average
particle size with a 3D measuring laser microscope (Olympus LEXT—model
OLS4100). The dimension of the sample area is 259 μm ×
259 μm, and the color bar on the right shows the scale for the
height of the particles. The red color indicates the maximum height
of 6.9 μm, and purple indicates the baseline. The thickness
of the microparticle layer is considered as the average value of the
heights of all the microparticles where the height is measured individually
using Digimizer, a graphic-analysis freeware.37 As a result, the values for three main parameters are obtained (concentration
of 4 mg/mL, distance of 4 cm, and gauge of needle of 25) for a minimum
of 2.3 μm uniform particle collection as it is shown in Figure S3. More details about the design of the
experiment including the degree of impact for combinatorial parameters,
parameter selections, and the layer thickness analysis for the electrosprayed
microparticles are provided in the Supporting Information Section.

slope). (b) Typical 3D scan of the polymer microparticles using a

the maximum height of 6.9 μm.

Using this
process, red-emitting PLEDs using a layer of MEH-PPV
microparticles as the active layer are prepared and tested following
protocols described in the Methods Section. Figure 2a shows a schematic
representation of the red light-emitting PLED architecture and Figure 2b shows its energy
band diagram. Figure 3 shows the device characteristics. There, Figure 3a shows the normalized electroluminescence
with a peak emission at 600 nm. The inset of Figure 3a shows a macroscopical picture of the PLED
under operation. Current density and voltage characteristics are shown
in Figure 3b. The peak
current density is 16.1 mA/mm2 under 13.5 V applied bias.
As seen in Figure 3c, the PLED also reaches its maximum luminance of 475 cd/m2 at 13.5 V. Finally, Figure 3d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) evolution of
the device during operation with a peak EQE at 3.2%.

This deposition approach can also potentially combine
different
conjugated polymer materials, without requiring the use of orthogonal
solvents. After the successful fabrication of the red-emitting PLEDs
by electrospraying, we chose to explore the combinatorial deposition
of both MEH-PPV (red-emitting) and F8BT (green-emitting) polymer microparticles
on the same substrate. Here, we show that emission spectrum of the
device can then be controlled simply by adjusting the ratio of the
polymer droplets density through deposition time. Figure 4a shows a schematic representation
of the fabrication setup for the color-mixed PLEDs. Syringe pumps
are used to precisely control the solution flow rate, and the distance
is the vertical separation between needles and the sample substrate.
All the parameters can be controlled independently for both depositions.
Here, only the deposition times is changed to control the relative
ratio of the MEH-PPV and F8BT polymer droplets.

focused on the sample surface for G/R = 3:7 PLED under operation.

and current density characteristics.

To show the level of control this approach provides, four additional
sets of devices are fabricated. Their active layer relative compositions
are F8BT-100% (G/R = 1:0), F8BT-70% with MEH-PPV-30% (G/R = 7:3),
F8BT-50% with MEH-PPV-50% (G/R = 1:1), and F8BT-30% with MEH-PPV-70%
(G/R = 3:7). Their normalized electroluminescence spectra are compared
in Figure 4b, together
with the previously fabricated MEH-PPV device (G/R = 0:1). The emission
peak for each PLED changes from green to red at 525, 535, 558, 580,
and 601 nm. Their emission full-width at half-maximum is 65, 86, 73,
59, and 54 nm. The right shoulder at ∼565 nm for the G/R =
7:3 device and the left shoulder at ∼540 nm for the G/R = 3:7
device matches the emissions from the unequal F8BT and MEH-PPV microparticle
ratio. The inset of Figure 4b shows an orange PLED (G/R = 3:7) under operation. The picture
is focused on the light-emitting particles instead of a macroscopic
point of view. It is a representation of the mechanism of spectrum
shifting of electrosprayed light emitting polymer particles blends.
For samples G/R = 7:3 (light green) and G/R = 3:7 (orange), green
and red light-emitting polymeric particles dominate the PLED emission,
respectively. As it is for yellow light-emitting PLED, green and red
light-emitting polymeric particles contribute equally to the PLED
emission. Figure 4c
shows the current density and voltage characteristics for the five
different PLED devices. From the plot, we can observe that the PLED
devices with mixed microparticles require higher applied voltage to
reach comparable currents. It is likely due to electric field interactions
between the two needles causing lower microparticle film uniformity
compared to using only one needle. Figure 4d shows that green-emitting (using pure F8BT)
PLEDs have the best power efficiency and the power efficiency decreases
when mixed with MEH-PPV droplets. The power efficiency of the red-emitting
(using pure MEH-PPV) is also higher than that of mixed PLEDs as they
require lower applied voltage to reach similar performance comparing
as previously observed. The standardized Commission Internationale
de I’Eclairage (CIE) diagram is generated using the CIE generation
software,38 and all generated CIE points
are shown in Figure 5a. The CIE coordinates for all five PLEDs are (0.26, 0.66) for G/R
= 1:0, (0.35, 0.60) for G/R = 7:3, (0.41, 0.57) for G/R = 1:1, (0.46,
0.50) for G/R = 3:7, and (0.58, 0.40) for G/R = 0:1. A gray line is
used to connect G/R = 1:0 and G/R = 0:1; the points fall gradually
onto the line when the MEH-PPV composition ratio of the PLED increases
starting from G/R = 1:0. Figure 5b is the combined images of all five PLEDs during operation.
The emission change from green to red as the relative ratio between
MEH-PPV and F8BT polymer droplets increases is easily distinguished.
The different shapes of the PLEDs, such as round and square, are due
to different types of shadow masks used for these two different stages
of the experiments.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully demonstrate that carefully optimized
electrospraying can achieve facile PLED fabrication. We first conduct
a complete series of experiments followed by statistical analysis
to identify the main electrospraying parameters. Then, an ideal set
of parameters are obtained to electrospray a thin and uniform conjugated
polymer microparticle layer which is suitable as the active layer
of the PLED. After the successful fabrication of a red-emitting PLED
using MEH-PPV microparticles, we demonstrate the ability to combine
different polymers and tune the device emission using mixed layers
of MEH-PPV (red-emitting) and F8BT (green-emitting) microparticles.
Even though the uniformity of the mixed polymer droplets based layers
are relatively difficult to control and the overall performance of
these PLED devices is still modest, we believe that this approach
presents a new paradigm for easy fabrication of hybrid multimaterial-conjugated
polymer-based optoelectronic devices with controllable properties.
Therefore, we believe that it could potentially bring a great change
and a brighter future for low-cost PLED devices.

Methods
The ITO
substrates (Kintec Company, 15 Ω/sq) are ultrasonically
cleaned in sequence using acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol for 10
min each. PEDOT/PSS (CleviosTM P VP AI 4083) is diluted with isopropanol
(1:3 volume ratio) and spin-coated atop the ITO substrate at 3000
rpm for 60 s to achieve a uniform layer, followed by a 20 min annealing
at 200 °C in a nitrogen-filled oven. Next, a hole-transporting-layer
of TFB (American Dye Source, Inc.) solution is prepared by dissolving
the polymer in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent (at 4 mg/mL weight concentration)
and deposited by spin-coating atop the PEDOT/PSS film at 3000 rpm.

For the red-emitting PLEDs using only MEH-PPV (from American Dye
Source, Inc.), the polymer is dissolved in THF and the solution is
electrosprayed on top of the spin-coated TFB film to form a uniform
microparticle layer with a thickness of ∼2 μm using the
following optimized parameters: solution of MEH-PPV with a concentration
of 4 mg/mL, a 6 cm distance between the needle and the substrate,
a needle gauge 25, a 10.5 kV applied voltage, a 2 mL/h flow rate in
the syringe pump, and a 2 min deposition time. Finally, a 120 nm thick
Al cathode is deposited on top of the electrosprayed particle layer
through a shadow mask using thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.3 Å/s.
The dimensions of the devices are 2 mm by 2 mm.

For the other
four different light-emitting PLEDs, all the fabrication
steps and parameters remain the same as for the MEH-PPV (G/R=0:1)
red-emitting devices, except the active layers deposition time. For
the G/R = 1:0, G/R = 7:3, G/R = 1:1, and G/R = 3:7 PLED devices, the
ratio between both polymers is controlled by varying only the deposition
time. For example, a deposition sequence of 42 s (green), then-18
s (red), then-42 s (green), and finally-18 s (red) is used for the
G/R = 7:3 device. In contrast, the alternating sequence 30 s (green)—30
s (red)—30 s (green)—30 s (red) is used for the G/R
= 1:1 device, compared with a 18 s (green)—42 s (red)—18
s (green)—42 s (red) sequence used for the G/R = 3:7 and 120
s (green) for the G/R = 1:0 device.

The sample surface is analyzed
using an Olympus LEXT 3D microscope
(OLS4100). Steady-state electroluminescence spectra are recorded using
a Jobin-Yvon iHE320 triple-grating spectrometer equipped with a Synapse
silicon CCD array. The PLED light-emitting power is measured using
a photodetector (Thorlabs, S120VC, 200–1100 nm, 50 mW) connected
through a power and energy meter module (Thorlabs, model PM100USB).
To verify the calibration, a commercial LED module with known output
power is used to obtain the attenuation factor before the PLEDs emission power measurements.
