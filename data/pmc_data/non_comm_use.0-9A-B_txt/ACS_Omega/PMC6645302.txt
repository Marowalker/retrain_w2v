Transition metal carbides are versatile
materials for diverse industrial
applications including catalysis, where their relatively low cost
is very attractive. In this work, we present a rather extensive density
functional theory study on the energetics of adsorption of a selection
of atomic and molecular species on two Mo terminations of the CdI2 antitype phase of Mo2C. Moreover, the coadsorption
of CO in the presence of preadsorbed metal atoms and its dissociative
adsorption in the absence and presence of preadsorbed Pt and K were
investigated. By using CO as a probe to understand the structural/electronic
effects of the preadsorption of the metal atoms on the Mo2C(001) surface, we showed that K further enhances CO adsorption/activation
on the surface, in contrast to the precious metals considered. Moreover,
it was observed that the presence of both Pt and K stabilizes the
transition state for the C–O bond dissociation, lowering the
activation barrier for the dissociation of the C–O bond by
about 0.3 and 0.4 eV, respectively.

1 Introduction
Transition metal carbides
(TMCs) have attracted considerable attention
in diverse industrial applications since the early 1970s due to their
superior materials properties including extreme hardness,1 high melting point,2 high electrical/thermal conductivity,3 and superconductivity.4 Recently, their
value as high-performance catalysts has also been recognized. They
have been used in many industrially important processes such as hydrodenitrogenation,5 CO hydrogenation,6 and hydrodesulfurization.7 In particular,
several reports have highlighted the higher activity and durability
of TMCs in the context of the water–gas-shift (WGS) reaction
when compared to the commercial Cu–Zn catalysts.8−10

One of the promising TMCs, proposed recently as a catalyst
for
the WGS reaction is Mo2C.11 Mo2C can be characterized by several crystal structures, with
different relative stabilities depending on the temperature.12 In the orthorhombic structure, the Mo atoms
are organized on a hexagonal sublattice with C atoms occupying half
of the octahedral sites in an orderly manner. In the hexagonal phase,
the Mo atoms exhibit a hexagonal close packing, with the C atoms statistically
occupying half of the octahedral sites. The hexagonal phase can further
be classified as eclipsed or CdI2 antitype, depending on
the arrangement of the carbon atoms.13 As
both hexagonal and orthorhombic phases are constructed based on a
hexagonal Mo network, these phases are interchangeably referred to
as either α or β in the literature, causing some confusion
in the nomenclature adopted by different authors.14−16 To circumvent
this confusion, we adopted the explicit naming convention CdI2 antitype, recently used by Tominaga et al.17 and Wang et al.18 for referring
to the polymorph studied in the present work.

Considerable effort
has been channeled toward studying the adsorption
of molecules on several Mo2C surfaces. Detailed density
functional theory (DFT) investigations of atomic and molecular adsorption
of small species such as H, O, CO, and NO, important for various reactions,
have been conducted on various clean Mo2C surfaces.19−21 Adsorption of most of these species proceed through either the formation
of strong covalent bonds or Coulombic interactions, both accompanied
by a large charge transfer. Furthermore, the effect of promoters such
as K13 and Rb14 and coadsorption of the reactant and intermediate species participating
in the reactions have also been explored.18

In addition to the energetics of adsorption, computational
data
on activation barriers, relevant for the WGS and other reactions,
are also available. In a DFT study, Tominaga and Nagai calculated
the reaction barriers of all of the intermediate steps involved in
the redox mechanism of the WGS reaction on a clean, CdI2 antitype-Mo2C(001) surface.22 The rate-determining step was identified as the reaction between
the adsorbed CO and O to produce CO2. Several possible
CO and NO dissociation pathways were explored by Shi et al. in a cluster
DFT study, and a wide range of activation energies were identified
depending on the initial conditions.19 The
elementary steps of the syngas reaction on several MoxCy stoichiometries were
studied by Medford et al., and their activity was found to be larger
than that of metal catalysts.23 Activation
of CO2 and H2 in the context of methanol synthesis,24 CO dissociation,18,21 CO hydrogenation,25 and hydrogen production from formic acid26 are further recent examples.

The interaction
of metals and Mo2C is of great interest
in the catalysis community.27−30 Mo2C has been successfully used as a heterogeneous
catalyst in several reactions including toluene hydrogenation,31,32 hydrodeoxygenation of acetone33 and methyl
stearate,34 hydrogen evolution reaction,35 ethanol dissociation,36 and CO generation.37 In addition to bare
Mo2C, several examples of Mo2C-based catalysts,
enhanced with a small amount of Pt-group metals such as Pt, Ir, Pd;
precious metals such as Ag and Au or other transition metals such
as Ni and Cu have been screened for activity and selectivity in a
large number of experiments.28,38−45 The results reported in these works reveal that whereas some of
the metals have no effect on the activity of the Mo2C substrate,
others induce a significant increase. Many of these studies also indicate
that the activity of the supported metal depends sensitively upon
many parameters, such as the amount of interfacial strain, the morphologies
of the Mo2C support and metal component, the loading, and
the temperature. In light of these results, an atomistic-scale study
of the surface chemistry of Mo2C by itself and when enriched
with metals is necessary.

In the present work, we explore, via
ab initio gradient-corrected
density functional theory, the surface chemistry of the two Mo terminations
of the Mo2C(001) surface in the absence and presence of
an alkali promoter (K) and two precious metals (Au and Pt). We tackle
this problem in three stages. First, we present calculated adsorption
energies of several atomic (H, O, C, Pt, Au, and K) and molecular
(H2O, CO, and CO2) species relevant to many
important heterogeneous reactions. We then explore the effect of preadsorbed
Pt, Au, and K on the energetics of adsorption of CO, which is used
as a probe molecule to sample the electronic and structural effects
induced by the preadsorbed atomic species. Finally, we calculate the
activation energies of a simple yet important reaction, namely CO
dissociation in the absence and in the presence of a single preadsorbed
Pt and K atom. Preliminary calculations suggest that the activation
energy of CO dissociation on the Mo2C(0001) surface is
not affected by the presence of a preadsorbed Au atom. CO dissociation
is a key step in various important reactions such as CO hydrogenation.21

We would like to stress that although
there have been extensive
reports on the adsorption characteristics of CO on the surfaces of
both orthorhombic and eclipsed hexagonal phase and other small molecules
such as NO,19 a complete account of the
adsorption properties of all of the adsorbates considered in this
work on the CdI2-antitype phase is absent from the literature.
As far as the promoters and precious metals are concerned, only K13,14,16,46 has been explored somewhat extensively on Mo2C surfaces.
In the very few studies involving the CdI2-antitype phase,
only one Mo termination has been considered. The present work aims
to give a more complete account of the adsorption and reaction characteristics
of both terminations and a wider range of molecules, promoters, and
coverages.

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we detail our
computational method. In Section 3, we present and
discuss our results, whereas our conclusions are presented in Section 4.

2 Computational Details
The calculations presented in this
work were performed within the
plane-wave pseudopotential DFT framework.47,48 The Perdew–Wang (PW91) exchange correlation functional49 as implemented in Quantum Espresso50 was employed in all of the calculations. The
open-source programs XCrysDen51 and JMol52 were used for visualization and to produce the
figures. During Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
geometry optimizations, a force threshold per atom of approximately
0.001 eV/Å was used. The use of ultrasoft pseudopotentials53 to model the interaction between atomic nuclei
and electrons allowed an affordable kinetic energy cutoff of 40 Ryd
and a density cutoff of 400 Ryd.

The CdI2-antitype
phase of Mo2C has a hexagonal
structure with a unit cell of 3 atoms, and an experimental c/a ratio of 1.5854 (a = b = 3.01 Å and c = 4.77 Å). In the present work, the lattice constants
were calculated using two methods: a fixed-volume calculation with
the experimental volume and the variable-cell method of
Wentzcovitch,55 which optimizes the cell
shape along with the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. The
fixed-volume calculations yielded 1.7 and −3.4% errors with
respect to the experimental a and c, respectively, whereas the errors for the variable-cell method are
3.0 and −2.1%. In the remaining calculations, we use the fixed-volume
values. These results are in reasonable agreement with previous theoretical
studies.14,18

The CdI2-antitype phase
Mo2C has an ABCABC...
repeating pattern of nonstoichiometric layers along the (0001) direction.
Two consecutive Mo layers are followed by a C layer, giving rise to
two Mo-terminated and one C-terminated surfaces. In this work, the
two Mo-terminated (0001) surfaces were modeled using a 2 × 2
slab with five or six layers. Whereas the five-layer slab corresponds
to a Mo termination with a C subsurface layer, the six-layer slab
has two Mo layers on the top. In all of our slab calculations, the
atomic coordinates of the two bottommost layers were fixed to their
value in the bulk to mimic bulk behavior. In a study by Shi et al.,19 the Mo2C substrate was represented
by a cluster model and the CO adsorption energy was reported to only
differ by about 0.1 eV even for modest cluster sizes. This is confirmed
by our slab model study (vide infra).

In all of the calculations,
a vacuum layer of at least 14 Å
was used to minimize the interaction between periodic images. A Monkhorst–Pack
grid56 of 8 × 8 × 1 points was
used to perform the Brillouin zone integrations for the 2 × 2
slab and scaled back accordingly with increasing cell size in other
calculations. The geometry-optimized surfaces, shown in Figure 1, will be referred to as Mo1
and Mo2 in the following. The calculated Mo1–C, C–Mo2,
and Mo2–Mo1 bulk interlayer distances are 1.17, 1.17, and 2.34
Å, respectively. During geometry optimization, the surfaces do
not undergo any significant reconstruction or appreciable deviation
of the interlayer distances with respect to the bulk values. The partial
density of states (PDOS’s) are also shown in Figure 1, where the block of states
around the Fermi level (at the zero of the energy axis) are contributed
by Mo d and C p orbitals. The two surface terminations do not display
appreciable differences in their PDOS profiles, in line with the lack
of extensive reconstruction.

Figure 1 Side view (upper panels) and top view (middle
panels) of the 2
× 2 surface slabs of the two Mo terminations of the Mo2C(001) surface, Mo1 (a) and Mo2 (b). The labeling scheme of different
adsorption sites and the projected density of states (PDOS’s)
are also reported in the middle and lower panels, respectively.

Atomic and molecular adsorption
energies were calculated at various
adsorption sites in a 2 × 2 surface cell. The adsorption energy, Eb, is calculated according to 1  where EMo2C+ads is the total energy of the Mo2C surface
and
the adsorbate, EMo2C is the
total energy of the clean surface, and Eads is the energy of the adsorbate. With this definition, stable adsorption
geometries have negative adsorption energy. Atomic adsorption energies
(i.e., for H, O, C, Pt, Au, and K) were referenced to the single atom
in the gas phase. Vibrational frequencies of the adsorbed species
were also calculated, and no imaginary frequencies were found. A large
cubic simulation cell (with a side length of 30 Å) was employed
for the calculations of isolated atoms and molecules, and the relevant
total energy calculations were conducted using the same cutoff energy
values as the bulk and surface calculations, but at the Γ point
of the Brillioun zone.

The effect of the preadsorbed precious
metal atoms (Pt and Au)
and the promoter (K) on the energetics of CO adsorption was investigated
by calculating the adsorption energy of CO on a surface with a single
preadsorbed metal atom (Pt, Au, or K). The CO adsorption energy is
therefore calculated as 2  where X represents a preadsorbed
Pt, Au, and
K species. Eb(X + CO) can directly be
compared to Eb for CO calculated according
to eq 1. To quantify
the effect of preadsorption, we use the energy difference 3  With the definition of eq 3, a positive ΔEb indicates an increase in the stability of the adsorbate in
the presence of the preadsorbed metal atom.

The climbing image
nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method was employed57 for the calculation of the activation barrier
for the dissociation of CO(CO → C + O). The optimization of
the initial and final states was carried out before the NEB calculation,
and conducted in a 2 × 3 slab only on the Mo1-terminated surface.
Following the identification of the reactant and product configurations,
the optimization of the reaction path was conducted over seven images.
Spin polarization was not included in the NEB calculations.

As the charge transfer upon adsorption is an important parameter
describing the adsorbate–surface interaction, the partial charges
on the atomic or molecular adsorbates were calculated by using the
Bader decomposition, as implemented by the Henkelman group.58

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Energetics of Atomic and Molecular Adsorption
on the Mo-Terminated Mo2C(0001) Surfaces
For the
atomic and molecular adsorption calculations, four initial, high-symmetry
sites were chosen, as indicated in Figure 1. On both Mo-terminated surfaces (Mo1 and
Mo2), two distinct threefold (hexagonal) sites were considered: h1
and h2. In the case of the Mo1 termination, the h1 site has a Mo atom
underneath in the third layer, whereas h2 is directly above the second-layer
C atom. For the Mo2 termination, h1 has a C atom underneath in the
third layer, whereas h2 has a Mo atom in the second layer. The remaining
high-symmetry sites are the on-top (t) and the twofold bridge (b)
positions. All of the adsorbates were placed at a distance of approximately
2 Å above the surface sites and subjected to geometry optimization.
The adsorption energies and charges on the adsorbates for the atomic
and molecular species are reported in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
In several instances, during geometry optimization, the initial adsorbate
configuration relaxed to a different high-symmetry site. When different
from the initial adsorption site, the final location is indicated,
along with the computed Eb value in the
tables. In particular, many of the species considered moved away from
the initial bridge site. Occasionally, the adsorbate was observed
to depart from the high-symmetry configurations shown and either tilt
slightly with respect to the surface in the case of molecules or move
to a location that cannot be clearly labeled as h1, h2, or t. Both
the tilting of the molecules and the migration toward a more stable
adsorption site are consistent with previous observations from the
literature.19

Atomic and molecular adsorptions are characterized
by a large charge
transfer from the surface to the adsorbate. The observed electron
donation properties of the Mo2C(0001) surfaces agrees with
past investigations.19,24 Overall, for O, C, and H atomic
species, the surface-to-adsorbate charge transfer is similar for both
Mo terminations. On the other hand, for Pt, Au, and CO, the surface
with the Mo2 termination donates a somewhat larger amount of charge
upon adsorption than the Mo1 termination. This difference is particularly
pronounced for CO adsorption on the h1 site. For adsorbed K, the charge
donation is from the adsorbate to the surface; this chemically intuitive
result is in accord with the works of Pistonesi et al.,13,46 both in terms of direction of the charge transfer and its magnitude.

The adsorption energies and the charge transfers calculated for
the atomic species reveal a strong adsorbate–surface interaction.
For all of the adsorption sites considered, Pt, Au, C, and O adsorbates
show a stronger affinity for the Mo2 surface. This is also the case
for H adsorption on the more stable h1 and h2 sites, whereas the energetics
of K adsorption is less sensitive to the two different surface terminations
and the adsorption site. For the Mo1 termination, h1 and h2 are the
most stable adsorption sites for all of the atomic species considered.
In the case of the Mo2 termination, the situation is less clear-cut.
However metal adatoms behave somewhat differently in the sense that
the t site becomes the preferred adsorption site for Au and Pt, at
variance with C, O, and H. It is clear that differences in the structural
and electronic properties of the two Mo terminations substantially
affect the interaction with metallic and nonmetallic adatoms.

CO preferentially adsorbs in the C-down configuration. The computed Eb value for CO adsorption in the O-down configuration
is very small at all of the sites, about −0.15 eV for the on-top
configurations for both Mo1 and Mo2 terminations, and less than −0.03
eV for all of the other configurations, in agreement with the work
of Shi et al.19 The C–O bond length
for CO adsorbed on the Mo1 surface varies between 1.16 and 1.19 Å,
depending on the adsorption site, whereas it is larger on the Mo2
surface, with a value of about 1.21 Å (except for the t adsorption
site, for which R(C–O) = 1.16 Å). These bond lengths are
slightly larger than the calculated gas phase value of 1.14 Å
and indicate a weakening and activation of the C–O bond upon
adsorption. The larger C–O bond length of the adsorbed CO on
the Mo2 termination compared to that relative to Mo1 parallels the
increased amount of charge transfer to the adsorbate on the Mo2 termination.
On the Mo1 surface, CO remains on the initial adsorption site after
geometry optimization, the only exception being the b site, where
the CO molecule tilts during geometry optimization by 59° with
respect to the surface plane. On the Mo2 surface, on the other hand,
a CO molecule, initially placed on the b site, is observed to migrate
toward the hollow h1 site. Overall, we see that different terminations
of the same surface stabilize different adsorption sites; on the Mo1
termination, CO binds preferentially at bridge and on-top sites, on
the other hand, hollow sites h1 and h2 are seen to be the preferred
adsorption sites on the Mo2 termination.

Triatomic molecules
exhibit a more complex adsorption behavior,
with alterations in the bond angles in addition to the bond lengths
with respect to their gas phase values. The CO2 molecule,
which is linear in the gas phase, bends with a O–C–O
angle of about 135 and 131° for the Mo1 and Mo2 terminations,
respectively. This is consistent with the charge transfer from the
surfaces to CO2. In contrast, H2O hardly acquires
any charge from the surface, in line with the larger equilibrium distance
from the surface, with vertical O-surface distances ranging from 2.31
to 3.26 Å. The H–O–H angles are calculated to be
in the range 104–112°. The computed value of Eb, although much smaller than the value corresponding
to CO2, is still relatively high and close to −1.0
eV. The H2O molecule also causes a mild rearrangement of
the surface Mo atoms on both Mo-terminated surfaces. From the data
collected in Table 2, we conclude that H2O preferentially adsorbs at the t
and b sites. Its placement at the h1 and h2 sites results in either
a migration to the t site or, in the case of Mo1 h2, a small adsorption
energy. These results qualitatively agree with the results of a recent
work59 on H2O adsorption on
the metallic (001) surface of the eclipsed hexagonal phase. CO2, on the other hand, was found to adsorb dissociatively on
the Mo1 termination, when it was initially placed on the t site. From
the results reported in Table 2, we then conclude that the molecular adsorption of CO2 is stabilized on the b site for both surface terminations.
The adsorption geometry, involving two Mo–O interactions and
with the C atom pointing downward, is shown in Figure 2. Overall, the geometries of molecularly
adsorbed CO2 are in reasonable agreement with an earlier
theoretical study of Ren et al.60 on the
Mo-terminated orthorhombic phase.

and Mo2) and H2O (on-top on Mo1 and bridge on Mo2) on the
two Mo-terminated surfaces. Upper panels display the side view, whereas
the lower panels display the top view of the geometries.

To characterize the effect of the preadsorption
of the alkali promoter
and the noble metals, we investigate their coadsorption with CO. The
choice of CO as a suitable probe molecule is due to its importance
in many industrially relevant reactions.19 In each calculation, Pt, Au, and K were preadsorbed on the h2, h2,
and h1 sites, respectively, as these were the most stable adsorption
sites for the single species on the Mo1 surface, and the CO probe
was placed on the neighboring h1, h2, t-Mo, and t-X (X = Pt, Au, or
K) sites. Here, we distinguish between t-Mo and t-X, as the former
is the site where the adsorbate is placed on top of a nearby surface
Mo atom, whereas the latter refers to a configuration where the adsorbate
is directly on top of the precious metal or the promoter. All of the
adsorbates placed on the h1 and h2 sites migrated to the t-Mo site
upon geometry relaxation, so that the presence of the preadsorbed
metal atom does not change the relative stability of CO adsorption
sites on the Mo1 surface. We accordingly only consider the t-Mo and
the t-X adsorption sites in the following discussion. To check the
convergence of the quoted numbers against surface coverage, the coadsorption
calculations were repeated in 2 × 3, 3 × 2, and 3 ×
3 surface slabs. The adsorption energies calculated for all of the
four coverages studied vary by at most 0.05 eV, which indicates the
reliability of our results even at the smallest coverage. The optimized
adsorption geometries are shown in Figure 3, and the adsorption energies are given in Table 3.

a The variation in the adsorption
energy due to the coadsorbed metal atom is also indicated (see text
for details), together with the C–O bond length (Å) and
the Bader charge on the adsorbate and the metal atom, qM (|e|).

Several
conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the results
reported in Table 3. Interestingly, the presence of the noble metals does not substantially
affect the stability of the coadsorbed CO on the t-Mo site, despite
the electron-withdrawing effect that the preadsorbed Au and Pt have
on the Mo1 surface and discussed above. The presence of preadsorbed
K further stabilizes and activates CO, and this can be understood
as a surface-mediated electron donation from K to CO. A similar result
was observed in the DFT study by Pistonesi et al. on the β-polymorph
of Mo2C.46 It is also interesting
to note that a similar adsorption energy for CO on t-M is obtained
when M = K, whereas a lower adsorption energy (and a lower activation
of the CO molecule) is observed for the t-Pt and t-Au configurations.
It would be interesting to see if these trends are conserved also
for the preadsorbed Au and Pt clusters and how the presence of the
metal cluster modulates the CO activation compared to the pristine
surface and to other TMC-supported metal clusters.24

3.2 CO Dissociative Adsorption
on the Mo2C(0001) Surface
It is interesting at
this point to assess
the effects of preadsorbed metal and alkali atoms on the activation
barrier of a simple reaction on the Mo2C(0001) surface,
namely, CO dissociation. Here, we concentrate only on the Mo1 surface.
Transition metal carbides are thought to be active catalysts for a
variety of important chemical reactions without the need for noble
metals such as Pt or Au. This aspect is important for the development
of active catalysts at a reduced cost.

The dissociation of the
CO molecule, starting from a tilted on-top geometry, as shown in Figure 4, is characterized
by an activation barrier of 2.01 eV on the clean surface, in good
agreement with a very recent study on CO dissociation on the CdI2-antitype Mo-terminated (001) surface.18 In the transition state, the CO molecule sits almost parallel
to the surface, with a C–O bond length of 1.80 Å. In the
final state, C and O atoms are located on the neighboring hollow sites.
For the same reaction, in the presence of Pt, shown in Figure 5, the calculated barrier is
lower with a value of 1.74 eV. The active participation of the Pt
atom in the scission of the C–O bond is both visually evident
from the geometry of the transition state, reported in Figure 5 and reflected in the PDOS
data presented in the same figure. The peaks between −2 and
−4 eV in the initial configuration in the presence of Pt indicate
a Pt d–C p hybridization. The effects in the bond distances
in the initial state are more subtle; the C–O bond lengths
are 1.21 and 1.23 Å without and with the Pt atom, respectively.
At the same time, in the transition state, C is observed to lose a
total of 0.2 |e| of electrons with respect to the transition state
in the absence of Pt. The C–O bond length in the transition
state, in contrast, is around 1.8 Å for both systems with and
without Pt. We see overall that Pt lowers the activation energy by
stabilizing the transition state.

Figure 4 CO dissociation profile on the clean Mo2C(001) surface
along with the projected density of states (bottom panels).

Figure 5 CO dissociation profiles on the Pt- and K-promoted
Mo2C(001) surface along with the projected density of states
of the
initial, transition, and final configurations.

An interesting observation is that the presence of Pt lowers
the
reaction energy of CO dissociation by about 0.5 eV by means of stabilizing
the final state, as seen in the reaction profiles in Figures 4 and 5. This is due mostly to the direct bond created between the C and
the Pt atoms with a bond length of 2.0 Å, which is very close
to the nearest-neighbor Pt–C distance in zincblende PtC.61 In addition, the difference in the PDOS profiles
of the final configurations presented in Figures 4 and 5 (left panel)
is evident. The C p states appear at much lower energies and express
overlap with the Pt d states.

In the presence of coadsorbed
K, the reaction barrier reduces to
1.57 eV (Figure 5,
right panel), 0.44 eV lower in comparison to the bare surface and
0.17 eV lower in comparison to the Pt-promoted surface. This can be
attributed to a greater stabilization of the transition state in the
presence of K compared to both the bare surface and in the presence
of coadsorbed Pt. Similar to the Pt adsorbate, the K atom participates
directly in the C–O bond dissociation, but by interacting with
both atomic fragments of the CO molecule. In the transition state,
the C–K and O–K distances are 2.97 and 2.63 Å,
whereas the elongated C–O bond (1.91 Å) is longer than
the value (1.8 Å) characteristic of the transition state on both
the bare surface and in the presence of Pt. This also means that the
geometry of the transition state resembles more closely that corresponding
to the final state, which accounts also for the larger value of reaction
energy computed in the presence of the K promoter compared to Pt.
This last point is also evident from the strict similarity of the
PDOS profiles corresponding to the transition state and final state
reported in the right panel of Figure 5.

4 Conclusions
The
adsorption energies of several atomic (H, O, C, Pt, Au, and
K) and molecular (CO, H2O, and CO2) species
on two Mo terminations of the CdI2-antitype phase of Mo2C were calculated in the density functional theory framework.
Moreover, the coadsorption of CO in the presence of preadsorbed metal
atoms and the dissociative adsorption of CO in the absence and presence
of preadsorbed Pt and K were also investigated to provide a detailed
understanding of the surface chemistry of the hexagonal Mo2C that can be used as a starting point for a complete characterization
of this TMC for processes relevant in catalysis.

The Mo2C substrate acts as electron donor for all of
the atomic and molecular species considered, with the exception of
the alkaline metal. In particular, the effect of the TMC is to activate
both CO and CO2, as revealed from the lengthening of the
C–O bond and the bending of the CO2 molecule upon
adsorption. Moreover, by using CO as a probe to understand the structural/electronic
effects of the preadsorption of the metal atoms on the Mo2C(001) surface, we showed that K further enhances CO adsorption/activation
on the surface, in contrast with the precious metals considered.

Finally, the dissociative CO adsorption was investigated both in
the absence and in the presence of preadsorbed Pt and K. It was observed
that the presence of the Pt and K stabilizes the transition state,
lowering the activation barrier for the dissociation of the C–O
bond by about 0.3 and 0.44 eV, respectively.
