Bioactive dietary polyphenols have
health benefits against a variety
of disorders, but some benefits of polyphenols may be not directly
related to them but rather to their metabolites. Recently, we have
identified the brain-available phenol glucuronide metabolite deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5) in perfused
rat brains following subacute treatment with the stilbene resveratrol
(1). However, the role of such a metabolite in the neuroprotective
activity of resveratrol (1) is not understood, in part
due to the noncommercial availability of 5 for performing
biological evaluation in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease
or other neurological disorders. Here, we describe a concise chemical
synthesis of deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5) and its precursor 4-O-Me-resveratrol (2), accomplished in four and six steps
with 74 and 21% overall yields, respectively, starting from commercially
available 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde. Pivotal reactions employed in
the synthesis include the palladium-catalyzed C–C coupling
between 3,5-di-tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxystyrene
and p-iodoanisole in the presence of tributylamine
and the acid-catalyzed glucuronidation between the trichloroacetimidate-activated
glucuronic acid and 4-O-Me-resveratrol.

1 Introduction
Bioactive
dietary polyphenols are receiving increasing interest
due to their reported health benefits against a variety of disorders1−7 arising from intestinal absorption, metabolism, and subsequent interactions
with target tissues.8−12 Additionally, some polyphenol metabolites from dietary sources might
have more profound biological activities than their precursors.10,13−16

Resveratrol (1; Figure 1), a polyphenol naturally produced by several
plants,
is widely reported to be beneficial for human health as an anticancer,17−19 antidiabetic,20−22 anti-obesity,20,23,24 anti-oxidant,25−28 anti-inflammatory,29−31 and anti-Alzheimer’s disease (AD)32−35 agent, among others. However, some of these beneficial properties
may be not directly related to this polyphenol but rather be a result
of its phase II metabolism. For instance, the resveratrol metabolites 2 and 3 (Figure 1) were shown to inhibit the growth of human adenocarcinoma
(Caco-2) cells by 80 and 86%, respectively, whereas resveratrol (1) at the same concentration impaired the growth by 52%.36 Patients with colorectal cancer and receiving
oral resveratrol (0.5 to 1.0 g/day for 8 days) have high levels of
metabolites 2–4 (Figure 1) in the colorectum,37 and metabolite 4 inhibited colon
cancer cell proliferation and led to an accumulation of cells in the
S phase.38 Remarkably, the mixture of such
metabolites induced a synergistic effect.38 Furthermore, resveratrol metabolites 3 and 4 (Figure 1) induced
similar delipidating effects to resveratrol in maturing pre-adipocytes,
and both glucuronide metabolites 2 and 3 showed a depleting effect, although lower than that of resveratrol,
in mature adipocytes.39 These findings
suggest that both resveratrol and resveratrol metabolites are involved,
to greater or lesser extents, in the anti-obesity effects of these
polyphenols,39 and the literature shows
that the activity of resveratrol and/or resveratrol metabolites depends
on their distribution and concentration in different tissues and the
species used for in vivo studies.9,40−42

resveratrol 3-O-β-d-glucuronide (2), resveratrol 4′-O-β-d-glucuronide (3), resveratrol 3-sulfate (sodium salt)
(4), and deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5).

Flavonoids have been known for some time to impact brain
function,43 and our laboratory and others
have shown that
grape seed extracts (GSE) and red wine are able to modulate AD phenotypes
by modulating multiple disease-modifying modalities via both β-amyloid-dependent
and β-amyloid-independent mechanisms.44−51 By assessing the accumulation of polyphenols in the brains of rats
treated with oral dosage of Cabernet Sauvignon red wine and testing
the identified brain-targeted polyphenols for potential beneficial
AD disease-modifying activities, we identified quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide as a novel anti-Alzheimer
agent.16 Our results showed that quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide may simultaneously modulate
multiple independent AD disease-modifying mechanisms and, as such,
may contribute to the benefits of dietary supplementation with red
wines in AD models.16 We have also identified
resveratrol 3-O-β-d-glucuronide (2) and deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5; Figure 1) in perfused rat brains following subacute
treatment with resveratrol (1) (300 mg/kg/day for 10
days) (unpublished data). The presence of such metabolites in the
rat brain suggests that they can penetrate the blood–brain
barrier (BBB) and may thereby play an important role in the anti-AD
effect of resveratrol (1). It is therefore important
to determine if and how these metabolites (2 and 5) are involved in the modulation of AD by resveratrol (1). However, only the resveratrol 3-O-β-d-glucuronide (2) is commercially available, and
there is no chemical synthetic approach described for obtaining deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5). To the
best of our knowledge, there is only one microbial synthesis of deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5) described
using Streptomyces sp. M52104.52

Here, we report the first chemical synthesis of deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5) and the
synthesis of its precursor 4′-O-Me-resveratrol
(2). The 4′-O-Me-resveratrol
(2) and deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5) were synthesized in four and
six steps with 74 and 21% overall yields, respectively.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 General Information
High-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade solvents were purchased from Fisher
Scientific. Chemicals and solvents were of reagent grade and obtained
from commercial sources without further purification. All reactions
were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on aluminum-backed
precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and compounds
were detected using KMnO4 (0.5 g) dissolved in 1 N NaOH
(100 mL) or H2SO4 (5% in water). Column chromatographic
purification was performed using 230–400 mesh silica gel, unless
otherwise noted. The proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H-NMR and 13C-NMR, respectively) spectra were
recorded using a Varian-INOVA 500 NMR spectrometer (Varian, CA, USA)
at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively. For the NMD analysis, the synthesized
substances were dissolved in a specific deuterated solvent [CD3OD (99.6% atom D; Sigma, St. Louis, MO); acetone-d6 (99.9% atom D; Sigma, St. Louis, MO); CDCl3 (99.8% atom D; Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ)] and then transferred
to a 5 mm Shigemi tube (Wilmad Glass, Vineland, NJ). Preparative high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on an Agilent HP1200 HPLC,
monitoring at 280 nm. The HPLC with ChemStation software version B.02.01.SRI
was equipped with a G1322A degasser, G1311A quaternary pump, G1367B
autosampler, G1316A thermostatic column compartment, and G1315C diode
array detector. A Phenomenx Luna 10 μm C18(2) 250 × 21.2
mm column was used for preparative HPLC on the Agilent HPLC system.
The column was eluted with an isocratic mixture of acetonitrile and
water with formic acid (0.1%) (28:72, v/v), and the flow rate was
set at 8 mL/min. The detection of newly synthesized metabolites was
achieved using a hybrid triple quadrupole/ion trap mass spectrometer
QTRAP 5500 from AB Sciex. Each compound was injected individually
and directly into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 7 μL/min
using electrospray ionization. Full and product ion scan modes were
utilized to assess precursor ion mass and MS/MS spectrum, respectively.
LC–MS/MS data were recorded and processed using Analyst 1.7
software (AB Sciex). Melting points were measured in open capillary
tubes on an Electrothermal IA9000 Series apparatus and are uncorrected.

2.2 Synthesis of 4′-O-Me-Resveratrol
(11)
2.2.1 3,5-Dihydroxystyrene
(7)
3,5-Dihydroxystyrene (7) was
prepared according to
the literature procedure.53 Sodium hydride
(NaH) (320 mg, 8.0 mmol) was dissolved in 6 mL of anhydrous DMSO,
and the mixture was stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h at
70 °C. The mixture was then cooled in an ice bath, and a solution
of CH3P(C6H5)Br (2.85 g, 8.0 mmol)
in anhydrous DMSO (5 mL) was added dropwise under vigorous stirring.
The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 10 min, and a
solution of 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (274 mg, 2.0 mmol) in anhydrous
DMSO (7 mL) was added dropwise under vigorous stirring and a nitrogen
atmosphere for 1 h. The reaction was quenched by addition of 60 mL
of diethyl ether and 100 g of ice. The organic phase was separated,
and the aqueous phase extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 40 mL).
The combined organic phase was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered, and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The residue
was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, eluting with hexane/diethyl
ether (1:3) to give 3,5-dihydroxystyrene (7) as a colorless
oil (248 mg, 91%). 1H-NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 9.22 (s, 2H, 2× OH), 6.53 (dd, J = 10.8, 17.6 Hz, 1H, H2), 6.30 (2× s, 2H, H4 and

Imidazole (953 mg, 14.0 mmol) was added
to a solution of 3,5-dihydroxystyrene (7) (238 mg, 1.75
mmol) in dimethylformamide (2.6 mL), and the mixture was stirred under
a nitrogen atmosphere for 15 min at room temperature. The silyl chloride
(1.82 mL, 7.0 mmol) was added, and the light yellow solution was stirred
for 18 h. The mixture was dissolved in diethyl ether (50 mL), and
water (100 mL) was added. The organic phase was separated, and the
aqueous phase was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL). The
combined organic phase was washed with brine (2 × 50 mL) and
dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent was evaporated
under vacuum. The residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography,
eluting with hexane/ethyl acetate (15:1) to give 3,5-di-tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxystyrene (8) as a colorless oil
(1.02 g, 95%). 1H-NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ
7.60–7.30 (m, 20H, Ph-H), 6.42 (2× s, 2H, H4 and H8),
6.37 (dd, J = 10.9, 17.6 Hz, 1H, H2), 6.15 (t, J = 2.2 Hz, 1H, H6), 5.33 (dd, J = 1.0,
17.6, 1H, Htrans-1a), 5.04 (dd, J = 1.0, 10.9 Hz, 1H, Hcis-1b),

133.0, 129.9, 127.8, 113.8, 111.3, 111.1, 26.7, 19.6.

2.2.3 p-Iodoanisole (10)
p-Iodoanisole (10) was prepared
according to the literature procedure.54 A mixture of 4-iodophenol (9) (264 mg, 1.2 mmol), methyl
iodide (170 mg, 1.2 mmol), and K2CO3 (828 g,
6.0 mmol) in 10 mL of acetone was stirred at 60 °C for 24 h.
After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into 100
mL of water and extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 40 mL). The
combined organic phase was evaporated under vacuum to remove the solvent.
The residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, eluting
with hexane to give p-iodoanisole (10) as white crystals (258 mg, 92%). 1H-NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.56 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 2H), 6.68
(d, J = 9.0 Hz, 2H), 3.78 (s, 3H, CH3). 13C-NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3): δ 159.5, 138.3,
116.5, 82.8, 55.4.

2.2.4 4′-O-Me-Resveratrol
(11)

mg, 0.39 mmol) and p-iodoanisole (10) (110 mg, 0.47 mmol) in anhydrous dimethylformamide (5 mL) at room
temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere were added benzyltriethylammonium
chloride (90 mg, 0.39 mmol), tributylamine (241 μL, 1.01 mmol),
and palladium (II) acetate (5 mg, 5 mol %). The resulting pale orange
solution was stirred at 110 °C for 30 min and then allowed to
cool to room temperature. The mixture was poured onto water (150 mL)
and then extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL). The combined
organic phase was washed with water (2 × 50 mL), then dried over
anhydrous MgSO4, and filtered, and the solvent evaporated
under vacuum. The residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography,
eluting with hexane/ethyl acetate (15:1) to give 3,5-di-tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy-4′-O-Me-resveratrol
as a pale brown crystal (276 mg, 98%). 1H-NMR (500 MHz,
acetone-d6): δ 7.63–7.36
(m, 20H, Ph-H), 7.38 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H, H2′
and H6′), 6.89 (d, J = 8.8 Hz , 2H, H3′
and H5′), 6.76 (d, J = 16.4 Hz, 1H, H8), 6.73
(d, J = 16.4 Hz, 1H, H7), 6.61 (2× s, 2H, H2
and H6), 6.16 (t, J = 2.2 Hz, 1H, H4), 3.78 (s, 3H,

128.6, 126.6, 114.9, 111.9, 111.3, 55.5, 26.9, 19.9. The next step
involved the deprotection of the TBDPS groups of 3,5-di-tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy-4′-O-Me-resveratrol.
To achieve that, TBAF trihydrate (1.0 M in THF) (1.9 mL, 1.88 mmol)
was added to a cold (0 °C) and stirred solution of 3,5-di-tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy-4′-O-Me-resveratrol
(337 mg, 0.47 mmol) in THF (8 mL). After stirring for 1 h at 0 °C,
saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (50 mL) was poured into
the reaction mixture. The resultant mixture was extracted with ethyl
acetate (3 × 150 mL). The combined organic phase was washed with
saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (2 × 50 mL) and brine
(2 × 50 mL). The aqueous phases were extracted with ethyl acetate
(2 × 100 mL), and the combined organic phases were dried over
MgSO4. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and the
residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, eluting
with hexane/ethyl acetate (2:1) to give 4′-O-Me-resveratrol (11) as a pale brown crystal (109 mg,
96%). The 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data are presented
in Table 1.

(5)
2.3.1 (E)-1-[3-Hydroxy-5-O-(2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranoside)phenyl]-2-(4′-methoxy) Ethene Methyl Ester
(12)
A suspension of the dried 4′-O-Me-resveratrol (11) (120 mg, 0.49 mmol),
2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-α-d-glucuronic
acid methyl ester, tricholoroacetamidate (296 mg, 0.59 mmol), and
4 Å MS (2.0 g) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (10
mL) was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The suspension
was then cooled to 0 °C, and a solution of the Lewis acid [TMSOTf
(22 μL in 1.4 mL of CH2Cl2) or BF3·OEt2 (42 μL in 2.7 mL of CH2Cl2)] was slowly added. The resulting suspension was continuously
stirred at 0 °C for 3 h (in the case of TMSOTf) or 5 h (in the
case of BF3·OEt2). Then, the reaction was
quenched with three drops of Et3N and filtered under Celite,
and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue was purified
by silica gel column chromatography, eluting with hexane/ethyl acetate
(4:5) to give (E)-1-[3-hydroxy-5-O-(2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranoside)phenyl]-2-(4′-methoxy)
ethene methyl ester (12) as a colorless oil [83 mg, 30%
(TMSOTf) and 97 mg, 35% (BF3·OEt2)]. 4′-O-Me-Resveratrol (11) was recovered from both
reaction conditions [78 mg (TMSOTf) and 60 mg (BF3·OEt2)]. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, acetone-d6): δ 8.36 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 2H,

(5)
To a stirred solution
of (E)-1-[3-hydroxy-5-O-(2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranoside)phenyl]-2-(4′-methoxy)
ethene methyl ester (12) (45 mg, 0.08 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) and methanol (4:1, v/v) (15 mL) at 0 °C under a nitrogen
atmosphere was added sodium methoxide [5.4 M (30 wt.%) in methanol]
(0.65 mL, 3.51 mmol). After stirring for 1 h at 0 °C, sodium
hydroxide (1.0 M in water) (13.3 mL, 1.3 mmol) was added to the reaction
mixture. The resulting pale-yellow solution was stirred at 0 °C
for 2.5 h. Amberlyst 15 hydrogen form was then added to adjust the
reaction mixture to pH 4. The resin was filtered off and washed with
methanol (3 × 20 mL), and the solvent was evaporated under air
flow to a thick brown oil. The oil was subjected to preparative HPLC
to give deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5) as a white solid (27 mg, 80%). The 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data are presented in Table 2. Melting point of 5: decomposes without melting above 250 °C. Preparative
HPLC was performed on an Agilent HP1200 HPLC, monitoring at 280 nm.
HPLC with ChemStation software version B.02.01.SRI was equipped with
a G1322A degasser, G1311A quaternary pump, a G1367B autosampler, G1316A
thermostatic column compartment, and G1315C diode array detector.
A Phenomenx Luna 10 μm C18(2) 250 × 21.2 mm column was
used for preparative HPLC on the Agilent HPLC system. The column was
eluted with an isocratic mixture of acetonitrile and water with formic
acid (0.1%) (28:72, v/v). The flow rate was set at 8 mL/min, and the
peak related to deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5) was detected at 37 min.

3 Results and Discussion
To ultimately address biological mechanisms whereby brain-bioavailable
deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide
(5) may impact the development of AD, we investigated
the synthesis of 5 from 4-O-Me-resveratrol
(11) (Figures 2 and 3).

Figure 2 Synthetic route to 4′-O-Me-resveratrol
(11) by Heck coupling between 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde
(6) and p-iodoanisole (10). Reagents and reaction conditions: (a) NaH, CH3P(C6H5)3Br, DMSO, 70 °C (1 h), then
r.t. (1 h) (91%); (b) imidazole, tert-butyl(chloro)diphenylsilane
(TBDPSCl) (8), DMF, 18 h (95%); (c) CH3I,
K2CO3, acetone, 60 °C, 24 h (92%); (d) BnEt3NCl, Bu3N, Pd(OAc)2, DMF, 110 °C, 30 min (98%); (e) TBAF trihydrate
(1.0 M in THF), THF, 0 °C (96%).

Figure 3 Preparation of deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5) from 4′-O-Me-resveratrol (11).

4-O-Me-Resveratrol (11) was
obtained
through the Heck coupling between the 3,5-di-tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxystyrene (8) and p-iodoanisole (10) (Figure 2). Styrene 8 was prepared, with
86% yield (two steps), through Wittig reaction between 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde
(6) and methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide according
to the methodology developed by Farina et al.,53 followed by the protection of hydroxyl groups with tert-butyl(chloro)diphenylsilane (TBDPSCl) (Figure 2). Protection of the hydroxyl
groups of 7 was necessary, but it is well known that
if styrenes are unprotected, or protected with acetyl or tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), desired products are obtained with low
yields.53,55 For this reason, we selected tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) as a protecting group since this group
is known to be more stable than TBDMS under both alkaline and acid
conditions.56,57 Synthesis of p-iodoanisole (10) was achieved with 92% yield as described
by Chen et al.54 To our satisfaction, the
Heck coupling between 8 and 10 furnished
3,5-di-tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy-4′-O-Me-resveratrol with 98% yield, and no non-TBDPS-protected
adducts and/or (Z)-isomer were isolated from the
reaction medium. The yield of the Heck reaction (98%) was more than
2-fold higher than obtained by Farina et al.53 and Hoshino et al.,58 who used the 3,5-di-tert-butyldimethylsilyloxystyrene (a TBDMS analogue of 8) as the olefin and acetyliodophenol (an acetyl analogue
of 10) for the reaction. Finally, the deprotection of
the TBDPS protection groups using 1.0 M TBAF trihydrate solution in
THF-furnished 4-O-Me-resveratrol (11) with 96% yield.

Using our synthetic approach, the 4-O-Me-resveratrol
(11) was stereoselectively obtained from 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde
(6) in four steps, 81% yield and excellent purity (HPLC,
>98%; Figure 20SA, Supporting Information).
To the best of our knowledge, our synthetic approach is one of the
most efficient routes to prepare 4-O-Me-resveratrol
(11). For example, Mizuni et al.59 reported the preparation of 4-O-Me-resveratrol
(11) using a Wittig reaction as the key step. Compound 11 was obtained in three steps, however, with only 7% overall
yield.59 Under the Wittig reaction conditions,
the (E)-isomer of 11 was formed as the
minor regioisomer (1.0:2.8, E/Z),59 similar to the 1.0:2.3 E/Z ratio reported by Orsini et al.60 but considerably higher than the 1.0:9.0 E/Z ratio described by Pettit et al.61 Šmidrkal et al.62 reported a highly
stereoselective synthesis of 4-O-Me-resveratrol (11) [only the (E)-isomer was observed] in
seven steps. These authors employed the Wittig–Horner reaction,
a well-known reaction for producing predominantly E-alkenes, as the key step for obtaining the desired compound 11; however, the overall yield for 11 was very
low (4%).62 The Wittig–Horner reaction
was used as a key step for synthesis of 4-O-Me-resveratrol
(11) from 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The authors obtained
4-O-Me-resveratrol (11) in six steps,
with 24% overall yield and 100% stereoselectivity for the (E)-isomer.63,64

The 1H-nuclear
magnetic resonance (1H-NMR)
and 13C-NMR spectra for all synthesized compounds shown
in Figure 2 are available
as Figures 1S–10S (Supporting Information).
The 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR and liquid chromatography
coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS) data derived from 4′-O-Me-resveratrol (11) were in complete accordance
with the assigned structure of 11 and those already published
in the literature (Table 1).52 The geometry of the double
bond was assigned as E for 11 based
on the coupling constant of the signals for the olefinic protons H7
and H8 (J7,8 = 15.9 Hz). This value is
consistent with those reported elsewhere by Pettit et al.61 (J7,8 = 15.9 Hz),
Orsini et al.60 (J7,8 = 16.4 Hz), and Lee et al.64 (J7,8 = 16.5 Hz). Finally, the LC–MS
analysis of 4′-O-Me-resveratrol (11) (Figure 20SB, Supporting Information)
showed the expected quasimolecular ion at m/z 241.1 [M – H]− (calcd for 11, 241.2).

The next step was the glucuronidation of
4′-O-Me-resveratrol (11), which
can be difficult because
of the very low reactivity of phenolic hydroxyl groups as a glucuronic
acid acceptor.60 First, we tried to perform
the glucuronidation of 11 under two different basic conditions:
(i) acetobromo-α-d-glucuronic acid methyl ester, Ag2O, piridine, 3 Å molecular sieves, 0 °C, 48 h65 or (ii) acetobromo-α-d-glucuronic
acid methyl ester, Ag2CO3, THF, 4 Å molecular
sieves, 0 °C, 24 h.66 However, under
both conditions, the desired glucuronide 12 was not formed,
and unreacted 4′-O-Me-resveratrol (11) was recovered from the reaction mixture. Due to the lack of success
in obtaining 12 using basic conditions, we attempted
to perform the glucuronidation of 11 (Figure 3) using trimethylsilyltrifluoromethanesulfonate
(TMSOTf) and boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BF3·OEt2), two Lewis acids that are well known to catalyze the glucuronidation
of phenolic compounds.67,68 Under these acidic conditions,
the desired glucuronide 12 was obtained in approximately
30 and 35% yields when TMSOTf or BF3·OEt2 were used as Lewis acid, respectively (Figure 3). Thereafter, deprotection of the acetyl
groups, as well as the hydrolysis of the methyl ester, was easily
achieved using a mixture of 5.4 M MeONa in MeOH and 1.0 M NaOH in
water at 0 °C for 3.5 h (Figure 3). Acid workup using Amberlyst 15 hydrogen form to
adjust the pH to 3.0, followed by evaporation of the solvent and purification
of the residue by preparative HPLC, furnished deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5) with 80%
yield and excellent purity (HPLC, >99%; Figure 1S, Supporting Information) from 5. Overall, our
synthetic approach furnished the deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5) from 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde
(6) in six steps, 21% yield, and excellent purity.

Deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide
(5) showed a quasimolecular ion at m/z 417.0 [M – H]− (calcd
for 5, 417.2). A fragment at m/z 241 for 5 (Figure 22SB, Supporting Information) was also observed, corresponding to the
neutral loss of 176 Da (the glucuronic moiety) from the quasimolecular
precursor ions m/z 417 [M –
H]−, indicating that 5 is a glucuronide
conjugate of 11. The same pattern of fragmentation was
observed for dihydroresveratrol-3-O-β-d-glucuronide, an analogue of 5.69

Complete assignments of the hydrogen and carbon atoms of both
the
aromatic rings and glucuronic acid moiety were accomplished using
heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) and heteronuclear
multiple bond coherence (HMBC) (Table 2) and are in accordance to those previously described
by Marvalin and Azerad,52 except for some
of the 13C-NMR assignments (Table 2). The 1H-NMR spectrum of 5, in comparison with that of 11, showed that
H2 and H6, which are identical in 11, became discriminated
in the glucuronide 5, as indicated by the multiplicity
of the signals at 6.78 and 6.64 ppm for H2 and H6, respectively (Table 2), suggesting that
the glucuronidation broke the symmetry of the molecule. The J7,8 value of 16.3 Hz for 5 confirmed
the E stereochemistry of the stilbene bridge and
agrees with the value reported by Marvalin and Azerad52 (J7,8 = 16.5 Hz) and Lucas
et al.70 (J7,8 = 16.4 Hz). The anomeric hydrogen H1″ (δH 4.92 ppm) was partially superimposed on the solvent signal; however,
it was possible to determine its anomeric carbon C3 at δC 160.5 ppm. Both assignments are consistent with those reported
by Marvalin and Azerad.52 The main discrepancies
between our 13C-NMR data and those reported by Marvalin
and Azerad52 are related to the assignments
for the carbon of the aromatic ring that bears the OMe group (C1′
to C6′) and the glucuronic acid unit (C1″ to C6″)
(Table 2). The anomeric
carbon (C1″) of the glucuronic acid moiety appears around δC 102 ppm, consistent with the literature data;68−70 however, this is very different from the δC 55.6
ppm reported by Marvalin and Azerad.52 The
assignments of proton-bearing carbons (OCH3, C2, C6, C4,
C2′, C3′, C5′, C6′, C1″, C2″,
C3″, C4″, and C5″) were achieved using HMQC.
The assignments of the ipso carbons C1, C3, C5, C1′, and C4′
were accomplished using HMBC. Specifically, C1 was assigned based
on its three-bond coupling with H8, whereas C3 and C5 were assigned
based on their two-bond correlation with H2/H4 and H4/H6, respectively.
It is worth mentioning that C3, to which the O-glucuronic
acid residue is attached, also has a three-bond long-range coupling
with the anomeric H1″. C1′ was assigned on the basis
of its three-bond coupling with H3′, H5′, and H7, whereas
C4′ was assigned on the basis of its three-bond coupling with
H2′ and H6′. In addition, C4′ showed strong three-bond
coupling with the methyl hydrogen (δH 3.80 ppm).
Thus, by the combination of HSQC and HMBC, all carbons could be assigned
unambiguously.

4 Conclusions
As outlined
here, we described the synthesis of 4-O-Me-resveratrol
(2) in four steps with 74% overall yield
and present what we believe to be the first report of the chemical
synthesis of deoxyrhapontigenin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (5), obtained in six steps with 21% overall
yield. The robust synthetic approach for 5 will allow
us and others to evaluate the mechanism of action of this brain-targeted
bioactive dietary glucuronide in the modulation of AD and other neurological
disorders by resveratrol (1).
