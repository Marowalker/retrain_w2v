Black
liquor (BL) from the kraft pulping process has been treated
at elevated temperatures (380 °C) in a batch reactor to give
high yields of a bio oil comprising monomeric phenolic compounds that
were soluble in organic solvents and mineral oil and a water fraction
with inorganic salts. The metal content in the product was <20
ppm after a simple extraction step. A correlation between concentration,
temperature, and reaction time with respect to yield of desired product
was found. At optimal reaction conditions (treating BL with 16 wt
% dry substance at 380 °C for 20 min), the yield of extractable
organics was around 80% of the original lignin with less than 7% of
char. The product was analyzed by gel permeable chromatography, mass
spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, elemental analysis, and
inductively coupled plasma. It was found that a large fraction composed
of mainly cresols, xylenols, and mesitols. This process provides a
pathway to convert a major waste stream from a pulp mill into a refinery
feed for fuel or chemical production, whereas at the same time the
inorganic chemicals are recovered and can be returned back to the
pulp mill.

==== Body
Introduction
Biomass has received
considerable attention as a source of renewable
carbon for production of chemicals and fuels.1,2 One
challenge is to find a suitable waste stream for upgrading to valorized
products. One such potential waste stream is lignin-containing black
liquor (BL) that is generated as a low value byproduct in pulp mills
(Scheme 1). BL is currently
burnt in the recovery boiler to regenerate process chemicals and to
produce energy, usually in large excess. As the recovery boiler often
is the bottleneck in a pulp mill, the BL is burnt to a low value and
at the same time limits the production of high value pulp. To increase
pulp production, techniques to extract the lignin part of BL have
been developed and implemented.3−5 However, besides a few reports,6−12 the lignin from such extractions has not yet been converted to high
value products.

Scheme 1 Illustration of the Kraft Process. DS = Dry Substance
An interesting pathway would
be to convert lignin, hemicellulose,
and other organic materials present in the aqueous BL to a renewable
bio oil, comprising phenolic compounds, vide infra (Scheme 2). It is known that lignin
from the kraft process can be transformed in aqueous solutions at
temperatures and pressure close to the critical point of water.13−19 Although most reports show good to excellent conversion of the lignin
fraction of the cooking liquor, the techniques rely on addition of
phenols, hydrogen gas, and catalysts. These additives typically improve
product yield and decrease coke formation but bring additional cost
and complexity to the process. Several reports have been published
on liquefaction of kraft lignin in presence of bases, such as K2CO3 and NaOH as additives.12,13,19−23

Scheme 2 Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) of BL to Produce Monophenolic
Compounds
Concentrated black
liquor has been gasified to produce synthesis
gas. Economical aspects of this process have been evaluated,24,25 and several pilot plants were successfully operated.26−28

Here, we report a simple, fast hydrothermal process for the
conversion
of lignin in BL into phenolic organic bio oils without any additives.
In one case, ethanol was used as an additive to reduce char in HTL
of high concentration (51 wt % DS) BL. The process gives significant
yields of phenolic compounds that are easily separated from the process
chemicals.

Results and Discussion
Given that existing reports
of hydrothermal degradation of lignin
and BL often apply hydrogen gas, catalysts, capping agents, and long
reaction times, we wanted to evaluate a simpler approach. The use
of hydrogen is associated with high costs for safety reasons, capping
agents, such as phenols, add cost and complexity, and catalysts used
in these systems are a subject to fouling and thus require frequent
regeneration. Our hope was to instead process dilute BL at near-critical
point temperatures and with short reaction times to maximize product
yield and minimize the formation of insoluble coke. We investigated
a fast hydrothermal decomposition of pure BL (mainly 16 and 19 wt
% DS, fir BL) into oil, gas, inorganics, and coke at temperatures
around the critical point of water.

Optimization of the Reaction
Conditions
Fresh BL (16 wt % DS, of which 5 wt % is acid
precipitated lignin)
from a kraft pulp mill was used in the experiments. The reactions
were performed in 10 mL Swagelok reactors using a fluidized sand bath
for heating. We found that heating BL in a closed reactor at temperatures
of 340–410 °C lowered the pH in the medium from above
11 to 8–9, enabling the phenolic material to separate from
the aqueous phase without the need of acidification. To obtain a total
yield of organics with low molecular weight (<700 Da), the product
mixtures were directly extracted with organic solvents. In this report,
we define the product yield as  

Temperature Dependence
As reported
by others,29 the temperature
has a significant impact on the extractable fraction obtained by hydrothermal
treatment of lignin. In the present system, the yield of bio oil,
measured as ethyl acetate extractable material obtained in the temperature
range of 340–420 °C was studied (Figure 1). The yield of extractable organic material
showed a linear correlation between 340 and 370 °C with an increase
of yield with temperature, peaking at 370–380 °C. At temperatures
above 380 °C, the yield of extractable organics decreased, and
the formation of char increased. Interestingly, the yield of low molecular
weight phenols, cresols, and mesitols showed a near linear correlation
to temperature, where at 340 °C, only 3 wt % monomers were obtained;
at 380 °C, 5 wt % monomers were obtained; and at 420 °C,
9 wt % of monomers were obtained. This shows that the monomers are
not responsible for the yield of extractable materials obtained.

influence on the yield of bio oil from 16 wt % DS BL,
1 h reaction time. An average yield from two separate attempts is
presented.

Effect of Concentration of the Black Liquor
Next, the effect of concentration of the BL in the hydrothermal
process was investigated. BL (16 wt % DS corresponding to a lignin
concentration of 5 wt %) was evaporated at 25 °C to give more
concentrated samples (34–62 wt % DS) for the study without
disrupting the lignin structure. The hydrothermal treatment was then
performed on samples of different concentrations. We found that the
formation of char was proportional to the concentration of lignin
in BL (Figure 2), which
suggests avoiding high concentrations. A thin liquor, 16 wt % DS (5
wt % lignin), was found to give minimal amounts of char, whereas reactions
performed on batches with higher lignin concentrations gave more insoluble
material. The addition of aliphatic alcohols (C1–C18) greatly
reduced coke formation, analogously to previous reports using phenols.12 In our system, the addition of 10 wt % of ethanol
to the hydrothermal treatment of highly concentrated BL (18 wt % lignin,
51 wt % DS) for 1 h reaction reduces char from 27.5 to 9.6%.

Figure 2 Influence of
lignin concentration on yields of bio oil and char.
Reactions performed at 380 °C and 1 h.

Influence of Reaction Time
In the present hydrothermal treatment,
the reaction time may affect
both the depolymerization of the lignin polymer to monomers and also
undesired reactions to form char. To find the optimal reaction time,
the reactions were performed using the optimized temperature (380
°C) and thin BL (5 wt % lignin). Noteworthy, it was found that
the depolymerization reaction is very fast and gives maximum yields
of soluble material within 20 min (Figure 3). After 20 min, a slight decrease in extractable
organics was observed. An explanation could be that the depolymerized
material loses weight by elimination reactions, for example, that
methoxy groups on aryls in e.g., guaiacol is converted to cresols.
The reaction time had negligible influence on monomer yield where
4 wt % monomer was obtained after 30 min and only increased to 5 wt
% after an hour.

Figure 3 Time influence on yields of bio oil and char at 380 °C.
An
average yield from two attempts is presented.

Thereby, the optimized reaction condition to generate highest
yields
of ethyl acetate extractable organics is to perform the reaction at
370–380 °C, using a thin liquor (5 wt % lignin) in less
than 30 min. This prompted us to study the extraction with a less
polar solvent. One application where the formed extractable organics
would be of interest is to produce green gasoline. To process feeds
containing high amounts of oxygen in a conventional fuel refinery,
it is important that the biofeed is soluble in a hydrocarbon carrier
liquid.30,31 A suitable carrier liquid for this feed
is light gas oil (diesel type). Gratifyingly, the organics from lignin
could efficiently be extracted by the gas oil in 62% yield. Thereby,
62% of the original lignin content could easily be blended in gas
oil for hydroprocessing in an oil refinery.

Product Properties
Storage
Stability
The obtained bio oil is a black viscous
liquid, storage stable at −20 °C under argon. The presence
of air and/or at room temperature decreased the solubility and increased
the molecular weight at room temperature under air. Most probably,
repolymerization reactions of the material are responsible for the
weight increase, which is also accompanied by increased viscosity.

Molecular Weight Distribution
Gel permeable chromatography
(GPC) analysis showed an average Mw of
550 Da of the obtained bio oil as compared to the kraft lignin feed
that has a molecular weight average of 3000 Da (Figure 4). Although this technique does not provide
an exact measurement of molecular weight,32 it gives a clear indication of a severe depolymerization. Simulated
distillation analysis confirms this and revealed a boiling point range
of 140–737 °C with 68% recovery (Supporting Information). It was also established by matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization that the maxima of the molecule distribution
appear to be in the range of 600–700 Da (see Supporting Information).

(gray), 2,2′-biphenol (dashed line), and o-cresol (dotted line).

Analysis of Low Boiling Fraction
Gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of product components (bp <
300 °C) confirmed that a majority of the volatiles were methylated
phenols, whereas anisoles were completely absent. The most abundant
phenols were 2,4-dimethyl-, 2,5-dimethyl-, and 2,4,6-trimethyl-phenol
(Figure 5). Phenols
containing larger ethyl and iso-propyl substituents were present only
in small amounts. This indicates the isomerization of anisoles and/or
propyl-phenols into mono, di, and trimethylated phenols during the
reaction. Similar results have been reported by others.33

NMR Study of Extractable
Organics
After modification
with a phosphorylating agent and 31P NMR analysis34 it could be shown that there are only traces
of aliphatic alcohols present. An NMR analysis of the aqueous phase
did not show any presence of hydrocarbons. This suggests that all
sugars as well as lignin have been transformed and extracted. gHMBCAD
suggested disappearance of aromatic methoxy groups and other aliphatic
ethers (Figure 6).
When comparing bio oil to isolated kraft lignin using 1H NMR, we could observe disappearance of signals at 3.2–3.9
ppm and appearance of signals at 0.8–1.5 and 1.9–3.0
ppm as well as significant shifting of aromatic signals downfield.

of dried BL (left) and HTL bio oil (right).

The disappearance of alcohol and ether moieties was in accordance
to a low oxygen content obtained from elemental analysis: C 80.47%,
H 8.60%, N 0.045%, O 10.45%, and S 0.53%, which is half compared to
isolated kraft lignin: C 61.80%, H 6.10%, N 0.31%, O 22.97, and S
2.29%. The inductively coupled plasma (ICP) revealed a severe decrease
in metal as well as sulfur content (Table 1).

Conclusions and Outlook
Thermal liquefaction of BL is a promising methodology to incorporate
into a kraft process. This gives the possibility to obtain a bio oil
suitable for fuel and material purposes as well as making it possible
to return inorganic chemicals back to the paper mill. To commercialize
an HTL process in the future, there are a number of challenges such
as: (1) heat recovery; (2) the discharge of monophenolics, inorganics,
and water from the supercritical phase in a continuous flow; (3) materials
withstanding corrosive reaction conditions (380 °C, high pH,
ionic reaction media). Given that these issues would be solved, the
HTL process of BL would be an important strategy to meet the demand
of bio-derived monophenolic compounds.

Experimental Section
General
The NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Unity
Inova (1H 499.9 MHz, 13C 125.7 MHz, 31P 161.9 MHz) spectrometer. The chemical shifts were referenced to
solvent residual peaks or internal standard (1H: CHCl3 at 7.26, DMSO-d5 at 2.49, 13C: CDCl3 at 77.0, 31P: hydrolysis product
of 2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane at 132.2 ppm).
The ICP-atomic emission spectroscopy was performed on a Spectro Ciros
CCD system (Kleve, Germany) equipped with an argon gas inlet, a cyclonic
spray chamber, modified Lichte nebulizer, and charge-coupled device
(CCD) detector. The elemental analysis was done externally by Analytische
Laboratorien, Prof. Dr. H. Malissa und G. Reuter GmbH, Industriepark
Kaiserau, 51789 Lindlar, Germany. The HTL reactions were performed
in a stainless steel (316) reactor built from Swagelok 3/4″
union (SS-1210-6) and two 3/4″ plugs (SS-1210-P), with total
volume of the reactor of ca 10 mL. The reactors could be reused at
least 50 times at temperatures up to 420 °C without leakage.
The heating was done by immersing into a liquid sand bath Omega FSB-3
(with two 750 W heating coils) with one heating coil controlled by
a CAL ET2011 thermostat. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed
on YL 9110 HPLC-GPC system with three Styragel columns (HR 0.5, HR
1, HR 3, 7.8 × 300 mm2 each) connected in series (flow
rate: 1 mL/min; injection volume: 35 μL; solvent: tetrahydrofuran)
and a UV detector (280 nm). A calibration was done against polystyrene
standard ReadyCal set with MP 266, 682,
1250, 2280, 3470, 4920, 9130, 15 700, 21 500, 28 000,
44 200, and 66 000 Da. GC–MS was run on a system
consisting of a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph and a Varian Saturn
2200 GC–MS/MS spectrometer with following settings: injector
temperature 280 °C; helium 1 mL/min; program 50 °C, 20 °C/min
to 300 °C, 3 min. BL was obtained from Bäckhammar paper
mill and used as is. It was stored under argon at 5 °C.

Optimized
Procedure for HTL of BL
A 10 mL stainless
steel (316) reactor was charged with fir BL (6 g) with 19 wt % DS.
The reactor was sealed and heated in a fluidized sand bath for 1 h
at 380 °C. After removing from bath and cooling to room temperature
the reactor was opened, and the contents were transferred to a flask
with small portions of ethyl acetate (20 mL in total) and water (5
mL in total). After removal of organic phase, the aqueous phase was
extracted further with ethyl acetate (10 mL). The combined organic
fractions were evaporated to give a black viscous oil.

The aqueous
phase containing most of the char was filtered, the solids were washed
with water and dried in an oven at 50 °C over night.

The
products were analyzed with GPC, NMR, and GC–MS.

Distillation
of the Bio Oil
The crude bio oil (639
mg) was distilled with a Kugelrohr apparatus to give 348 mg dark yellow
oil and 183 mg residue. The distillate was miscible with pentane.
