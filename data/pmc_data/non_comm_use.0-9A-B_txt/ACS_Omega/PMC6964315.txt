The combined effects of surface area, pore structure,
degree of graphitization,
and number of carbon functional groups on the gasification kinetics
of tri-high coal char prepared at an elevated temperature were studied
by a thermogravimetric analyzer and various characterization methods
[scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) theory, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier
transfer infrared spectroscopy]. In the kinetic analysis, the CO2 gasification of high-ash coal was not adequately described
by the random pore model because ash influenced the char structure
during pyrolysis and gasification. Meanwhile, the SEM and BET results
indicated the promotion of micropore formation and mesopore expansion
of the coal char during pyrolysis. The XRD, Raman, and FTIR results
evidenced a significant increase of large aromatic groups during the
pyrolysis process, attributable to the cracking of aliphatic groups
and the polycondensation of the cracking residues. Overall, the porous
structure and aromatic groups of coal char developed during the pyrolysis
process improved the CO2 gasification kinetics of the tri-high
coal char.

==== Body
Introduction
Tri-high coal is the most representative
coal in Southwest China,
which has the characteristics of high ash content, high sulfur content,
and high ash fusion. Under the growing demand for power and other
applications, tri-high coal has attracted an increasing share of attention.
However, the utilization of such coals aggravates various environmental
problems, such as SOx emission and high
greenhouse gas emissions.1 Coal gasification,
which efficiently converts coal into either clean energy (i.e., heat
and electricity) or high value-added chemicals, is touted as a clean
and efficient usage of tri-high coal. When CO2 was used
as a gasification agent, the porous structure of residual char was
significantly increased.2,3 Coal gasification usually
proceeds in two steps: coal pyrolysis and subsequent char gasification.4 The char gasification is the rate-determining
step,5 and char gasification mechanisms
have been investigated;6−8 their regular empirical reaction models have been
addressed, such as the volume model,9 the
hybrid model,10 and the random pore model
(RPM).11−13 The RPM was widely applied since the char was characterized
by the presence of pores and cracks, which can contribute to intraparticle
gas penetration and subsequent particle structural changes.12,14−17 However, for brown coals, catalytic gasification, and most biomass
gasification, the RPM model shows shortcomings specifically at high
conversions. Meanwhile, some conditions promote polycondensation and
volatilization during char gasification; these processes increase
the ash content of the composition and the porous structure, with
significant changes in the gasification characteristics. Therefore,
whether the RPM adequately describes the char gasification kinetics
under pyrolysis conditions that promote high-ash content is worthy
of discussion.

As the initial stage of coal gasification, coal
pyrolysis has a
great influence on the composition and structure of the initial char,
which has a great influence on the subsequent char gasification characteristics.
Pyrolysis is a very complex process, which involves the following
aspects: decomposition of organic matter, volatilization of low-molecular-weight
cracking products, polycondensation of cracking residues, decomposition
and combination of volatile products, and further decomposition and
repolycondensation of the polycondensation products.18,19 All of these processes affect the porous structure, the single-crystal
ordering (crystallite formation) of graphite, and the degree of graphitization
in the coal char, which are directly related to the char reactivity
and to the economics of coal gasification. Nevertheless, owing to
the complexity of these chemical and physical decomposition processes,
how the structure and composition of coal alter during the pyrolysis
and thereby influence the gasification kinetics remains poorly understood,
especially in tri-high coal gasification.

A tri-high coal from
southwest China was selected to investigate
whether the RPM adequately describes the gasification kinetics of
the tri-high coal char. This paper also presented the evolution of
the surface area, pore structure, and crystalline features of tri-high
coal during high-temperature pyrolysis by joint analytical measures,
such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) theory, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier
transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and the influence of these
features on the char gasification kinetics.

Results
Experimental Results
Figure 1 shows the time evolutions of the carbon
conversions of the variously sized chars prepared at 950, 1000, and
1050 °C. Pyrolysis temperature exerted a noncomplicated effect
on the char gasification process; specifically, raising the pyrolysis
temperature generally improved the carbon conversion efficiency for
a given particle size. The carbon conversion efficiency was also sensitive
to the coal particle size. At a constant pyrolysis temperature, reducing
the particle size is helpful to improve the carbon conversion rate
in the char gasification process of coal char.

vs gasification time for char samples
of different sizes prepared at different temperatures.

Kinetic Analysis
Figure 2 shows the reaction rates as functions of carbon conversion
ratio at different temperatures, both obtained in the experiment (symbols)
and calculated by the RPM (dotted lines). The reaction rate gradually
rose to its maximum in the 0.1–0.2 range of carbon conversion
ratios and then steadily declined during the char gasification. The
squared correlation coefficients (R2)
between the experimental and theoretical results were generally very
high (>0.92), indicating that the modeled data well fitted the
experimental
data.

of different sizes prepared at different temperatures. Symbols: experimental
data; dotted lines: fitting results of the RPM.

Table 1 reports
the experimentally observed rate constants k and
the structural parameters ψ obtained by the RPM in all cases.
As expected, the rate constant k increased with increasing
temperature and with decreasing particle sizes. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 2, the modeled and experimental
data well agreed for smaller coal char particles (48–106 μm)
but diverged for the larger particles (154–355 μm). This
is attributable to the structural parameter ψ in the RPM, which
cannot be accurately estimated for large-sized particles. During the
parameter estimation, the value sometimes approached zero (lower boundary),
given as the second term in the RPM equation (eq 3). In such cases, the model reduces to the
volumetric model, as reported in previous studies.20,21 When the ash contents of the selected coal reached 20.8%, the coal
particle size exceeded 154 μm, and the ash greatly influenced
the char preparation and gasification processes. Consequently, the
RPM model failed to capture the variations in the char structures
during the char gasification process, especially in the postreaction
stage.22,23

Moreover, the char particles of different sizes prepared
at different
temperatures exhibited different structural parameters [porous structure,
single-crystal ordering of graphite (crystallites), and degree of
graphitization]. These parameters are directly related to the char
kinetics. The structures of the initial char samples prepared under
different pyrolysis temperatures and their influence on the gasification
reactivity were then characterized by SEM, BET, XRD, Raman, and FTIR.
The samples were raw coal of particle size 48–65 μm,
and its chars were prepared at 950, 1000, and 1050 °C under an
N2 atmosphere.

Morphology of Samples
SEM images of the selected samples
are shown in Figure 3. The sizes, smooth and rough surfaces, and irregularities in the
shapes and structures of the visible surface pores are clearly revealed.
The surface of the raw coal resembled a regular rock with no visible
surface pores. After pyrolysis, the char surface was obviously porous.
The chars prepared at 1000 and 1050 °C were coarse with some
small embossed features, which were identified as parts of a small
surface bulge. Increasing the char pyrolysis temperature promoted
the emergence of pores and embossed features by intensifying the thermal
condensation. The char samples prepared at 1000 and 1050 °C contained
more pores of larger size than the sample prepared at 950 °C,
possibly because the pores integrated and merged at higher temperatures.
These actions increased the surface areas of the chars prepared at
higher temperatures, thereby increasing their gasification rates in
the gasification process (see Figures 1 and 2).

Figure 3 SEM images of the raw
coal and char samples prepared from pyrolysis
at 950, 1000, and 1050 °C.

N2 Adsorption–Desorption Isotherm Characteristics
Table 2 lists the
BET specific surface areas and total pore volumes of the selected
samples. Obviously, the surface area of the raw char was very small,
and the surface areas of the processed chars increased with the char
generation temperature. The specific surface areas of the raw coal,
char prepared at 950 °C, and char prepared at 1050 °C were
13.5, 253.5 and 320.4 m2/g, respectively. The increased
char surface area at high pyrolysis temperatures may be attributable
to pore growth and new pore formation. The pore volume of raw coal
and coal char showed a similar trend, which were consistent with the
SEM images.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
and pore
size distributions of the selected samples are shown in Figure 4. The International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification describes six types
of isotherms in adsorption–desorption curves.24 The isothermal adsorption–desorption curve of raw
coal (Figure 4a) resembled
a type III isotherm, indicating a small number of mesopores. Real
adsorption–desorption isotherms are usually combinations of
the six types of curves defined by IUPAC. The isothermal adsorption
curves of all char samples exhibited the features of type I and type
II isotherms. At near-zero relative pressures, the adsorption capacity
increased rapidly owing to the micropore structure. Increasing the
relative pressure increased the adsorption capacity via multilayer
adsorptions in the pore. At high relative pressures, the adsorption
amount increased rapidly. The adsorption had apparently not saturated
even when the relative pressure approached 1 because capillary condensation
occurred. Moreover, the desorption volume was obviously higher than
the adsorption volume, and hysteresis loops appeared at P/P0 ratios above 0.4, indicating a continuous
and complete pore structure (comprising both micropores and mesopores)
in all chars.24 The hysteresis loop was
weak in the isothermal adsorption–desorption curve of the char
prepared at 950 °C and larger in the curve of the sample prepared
at 1000 °C (Figure 4a), indicating increased porosity of the char samples. The isothermal
adsorption–desorption curve of the 1050 °C char was slightly
higher than, but otherwise similar to, that of the 1000 °C char.
As shown in Figure 4b, pyrolysis significantly increased the adsorption of the samples,
and the effect increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Examining
the pore size distribution characteristics of the selected samples,
the raw coal sample mainly consisted of small (2–4 nm-diameter)
mesopores, whereas the char samples mainly consisted of micropores
with pore sizes below 2 nm and small mesopores of diameters 3–5
nm. This observation indicates that pyrolysis promoted the formation
of micropores and the development of mesopores, consistent with the
BET specific surface areas and total pore volumes. Therefore, the
chars acquired their porosity via micropore formations and expanding
mesopores during the pyrolysis process, which were facilitated by
a high pyrolysis temperature.

isotherms and (b)
pore size distributions of the raw coal and char samples prepared
by pyrolysis at 950, 1000, and 1050 °C (A: Adsorption isotherms;
D: Desorption isotherms).

XRD Pattern Analysis
The XRD patterns of the selected
samples are shown in Figure 5. The proximate analysis revealed 22.08% ash content in the
raw coal, and mineral signals appeared in the XRD patterns. The samples
also contained some graphitelike structures (crystalline carbon),
as indicated by the clear (002) band at ∼26° and the (100)
band in the neighborhood of graphite at ∼43°.25 These observations suggest that the structures
of the crystallites in all samples were intermediate between graphite
and the amorphous state. This intermediate state is called the turbostratic
structure or the random-layer lattice structure. The clear asymmetric
(002) band around 26° in the XRD profiles suggests the existence
of another band (γ) on the left-hand side. The γ band
around 20° has been reported by numerous authors and has been
attributed to saturated structures such as aliphatic side chains attached
to the periphery of the carbon crystallites.26,27

Figure 5 XRD
spectra of the raw coal and char samples prepared by pyrolysis
at 950, 1000, and 1050 °C in the 2θ range ∼10–90°.

Figure 6 shows the
XRD patterns after smoothing and processing by Peakfit4.2. Overall,
the 002 peaks were wider in the char samples than in raw coal and
gradually widened with increasing pyrolysis temperature. This indicates
that higher pyrolysis temperatures favored the vertical stacking of
the microcrystalline structures. Owing to the very thin aromatic layer,
no 100 peak was found in the raw coal sample. The presence of these
peaks in the char samples indicates that pyrolysis increased the size
of the carbon network plane. At 950 °C, the γ peak hardly
changed from that of raw coal, indicating that the aliphatic side
chains were not cracked at this temperature. When the temperature
rose to 1000 °C, the aliphatic side chains and other unstable
macromolecule groups dissociated to form low-molecular-weight groups.
Such dissociation and volatilization narrowed the γ peaks at
1000 and 1050 °C.

Figure 6 Curve-fittings of the XRD peaks for selected samples in
the 2θ
ranges 15–32 and 38–53°.

The crystallite structural parameters La, Lc, and d002 were calculated by Bragg‘s law and the Scherrer
equation,28,29 as shown in Table 3. The d002 and Lc values depended on the pyrolysis temperature,
but La did not. This result consolidates
that the
aliphatic side chains and other macromolecule groups dissociated into
low-molecular-weight groups at elevated temperature, some of which
volatilized. The cracking residues then acted as lubricants between
the aromatic layers, promoting the relative sliding and alignment
of the microchip layers. The consequent parallel stacking of the microchip
layers decreased the horizontal dimension La of the aromatic microcrystal. Meanwhile, the vertical dimension Lc was significantly reduced by polycondensation
of the aromatic layers in the longitudinal direction. Polycondensation
and aromatization of the cracking residues, dehydrogenation of hydrogenated
aromatics, and pyrolysis of heterocycles occurred during the pyrolysis
process, increasing the number of aromatic ring structures, disordering
the stacking and lamellae, and hence increasing the interlayer spacing
between the crystallite layers (d002).

Raman Spectral Analysis
Typical first-order region
Raman spectral profiles, collected between 800 and 2000 cm–1 for each char sample, are shown in Figure 7. Two characteristic peaks at ∼1330
cm–1 (D band) and ∼1590 cm–1 (G band) in the Raman spectra were experimentally determined.30 The peaks in each Raman spectrum were fitted
by the curve-fitting software Peakfit4.2. The peaks resolved into
four Lorentzian bands (designated as the G, D1, D2, and D4 bands) and one Gaussian band (the D3 band), as shown in Figure 7. The mathematical fitting procedures were based on the procedures
outlined in the studies by Larouche
et al.,31 Dippel et al.,32 Jawhari et al.,33 Cuesta et
al.,34 and Nistor et al.35 The D1 band at ∼1350 cm–1 refers to the broadening of the G peak resulting from the disordering
of carbon, and the D2 band at 1615–1625 cm–1 is the acromion of G peak at 1615–1625 cm–1, which refers to the E2g vibration mode of the surface
graphite layer.31,36 The D3 band at ∼1500
cm–1 is the amorphous sp2–bonded
form of carbon, D4 at ∼1250 cm–1 is attributed to the amorphous mixed sp2–sp3 bonded forms of carbon, and the G band refers to the graphitic
band.29,36,37

region Raman spectra of the selected samples
and their resolved bands.

Figure 8 shows the
pyrolysis temperature dependences of the area ratios of the D1, D3, and D4 bands on the G band (denoted
as ID1/IG, ID3/IG, and ID4/IG, respectively) and the G band relative to
the integrated area under the spectra (denoted as IG/Iall). The ID4/IG ratio remained
almost unchanged from that of raw coal at 950 °C but decreased
significantly at 1000 °C. This sudden decline reflects the cracking
of numerous cross-linking bonds in the pyrolyzed sample, such as aliphatic
side chains (as shown in the XRD results). The reduced cross-linking
density lowered the ID4/IG ratio. Moreover, as the cross-linking bonds
were almost completely cracked at 1000 °C, the ID4/IG values were
very similar in the chars prepared at 1000 and 1050 °C. The formation
of large aromatic structures from the cracking residues by polycondensation
increased the ID1/IG ratio. Higher temperatures favor the polycondensation
reaction, so the ID1/IG value increased with temperature. During pyrolysis,
the volatilization and polycondensation of low-molecular-weight groups
into large aromatic structures decreased the relative contents of
the sp2 and sp2–sp3 bonding
carbon atoms, thereby reducing ID3/IG. As expected, the IG/Iall ratios also reduced
with increasing pyrolysis temperature (from raw coal to the char prepared
at 1050 °C). This trend is attributable to the increased spacing
between the crystallite layers and the formation of more amorphous
char structures at higher temperatures. These results confirm the
relationship between the G band and the crystalline component in the
carbons. The mild decline of IG/Iall with increasing pyrolysis temperature is
consistent with the previous literature.37 The Raman spectral results were also consistent with the XRD pattern
results.

FTIR Spectral Analysis
To better understand the structures
of the raw coal and char samples, the changes in the carbon functional
groups between the raw coal and chars prepared at different pyrolysis
temperatures were investigated by FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra
of the selected samples are presented in Figure 9. The spectra were characterized by six principal
bands at 3700–3200, 2960–2850, 1620, 1380, 1250–1000,
and 900–700 cm–1. The bands between 3750
and 3200 cm–1 were assigned to −OH stretching
in organic compounds with oxygen functional groups typically found
in coal, including phenols, alcohols, and carboxylic acid. Meanwhile,
the bands at 2960–2850, 1620, and 1380 cm–1 were attributed to aliphatic C–H stretching, aromatic C=C
stretching, and aliphatic −CH3 bending, respectively.
The bands between 1250 and 1000 cm–1 were assigned
to Si–O–Al bending vibrations, and the bands between
900 and 700 cm–1 were caused by aromatic out-of-plane
C–H bending.26,36,38,39

Figure 9 FTIR spectra of the selected samples.

Figure 10 shows
the fitted FTIR spectra of the raw coal and char samples in selected
wavenumber regions (4000–2600 and 1800–650 cm–1). The area ratios of Cal and Car in both regions are shown in Table 4. The weak fitting bands at
3800 and 3640 cm–1 were assigned to free −OH
groups, whereas the bands at 3450 and 3250 cm–1 were
attributed to −OH stretching. In the spectrum of raw coal,
aliphatic C–H was responsible for the broad band at 2960 cm–1 and the two narrow bands at 2920 and 2850 cm–1; as expected, these peaks narrowed with temperature.
Several absorption bands attributed to aromatic and aliphatic groups
were located between 1800 and 650 cm–1 (Figure 10b1–b4). An aromatic C=C stretching band at 1620 cm–1, two aromatic C–H vibration bands at ∼890 and ∼780
cm–1, and an aliphatic −CH3 bending
band at 1380 cm–1 were also found. The area ratios
of Cal and Car in each range are given in Table 4. As the pyrolysis temperature increased, the area
ratios of Cal and Car decreased and increased, respectively. Again, this trend
can be explained by the cracking of aliphatic groups into low-molecular-weight
groups followed by their partial volatization, which reduced the area
ratio of Cal as the pyrolysis temperature
increased. Meanwhile, polycondensation of the cracking residues into
large aromatic structures increased the aromatic group contents (Car). As a high pyrolysis temperature is beneficial
to polycondensation, Car was an increasing
function of temperature. These results were consistent with the XRD
and Raman analysis results.

Discussion
As evidenced in the kinetics and the structural
characterization
of raw coal and its char products, the char kinetics were influenced
by the developed surface areas, pore structures, and crystalline carbon
features. Owing to the development and generation of micropores and
mesopores during the pyrolysis process, the particle structures were
more porous in the char samples than in raw coal. Meanwhile, the cracking
of aliphatic groups into low-molecular-weight groups and the polycondensation
of cracking residues into large aromatic structures largely affected
the crystallite structures and functional groups of coal char during
the pyrolysis process. The reactivity of coal char was affected by
the combined action of these structural transformations.

The
gasification of tri-high coal char under CO2 at
elevated temperatures was monitored by a thermogravimetric analyzer
(TGA). The TGA results showed a gradual rise in the gasification rate,
followed by a steady decrease as the gasification proceeded. The kinetics
of the char-CO2 gasification reactions were then studied
by the RPM. The RPM could not fully describe the CO2 gasification
of high-ash coal because the high-ash content greatly influenced the
char structure during pyrolysis and gasification.

The surface
areas, pore structures, and carbon crystalline features
of the raw coal and char samples prepared at different temperatures
were also analyzed. The surface areas and pore structures of the chars
were well developed during the pyrolysis process. Meanwhile, the residual
low-molecular-weight groups produced by the cracking of aliphatic
side chains acted as lubricants, promoting the parallel stacking of
microchip layers. The polycondensation of aromatic layers in the longitudinal
direction significantly increased the stacking height and the interlayer
spacing. The changing aromaticity and crystalline carbon contents
were consistent in the XRD and Raman spectra analyses. In addition,
the FTIR spectra confirmed an obvious decrease of aliphatic groups
and a significant increase of aromatic groups in the char samples
relative to raw coal.

In summary, the pyrolysis process enhanced
the surface areas and
pore structures of the chars and promoted the formation of large aromatic
groups, thereby improving the reactivity of the tri-high coal chars.

Table 5 summarizes the proximate analysis of the Chinese tri-high
coal investigated in the present study. The raw coal samples were
ground and sieved into particles of different sizes: 48–65,
75–106, 154–200, and 280–355 μm. The char
was prepared at 950, 1000, or 1050 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere
in a fixed bed reactor. During the char preparation process, a 20
g sample of coal char was placed in a corundum crucible and then heated
at 20 °C/min to the designed temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Finally, the sample was held at that temperature for 30 min. Meanwhile,
the char samples prepared at different temperatures were named 950
°C char, 1000 °C char, and 1050 °C char.

The char CO2 gasification was carried out

and then heated at 20 °C/min to the designed temperature (1000

was started by switching the gas flow to CO2 (50 mL/min).
Finally, the sample was held at the designated temperature for 120
min. The temperatures of the char preparation and gasification processes
are given in Table 6.

Kinetic Modeling
The carbon conversion efficiency (x) of char is defined as the mass ratio of the gasified
char at time t to the initial char 1  where m0 and mt are the initial char mass
and the instantaneous char mass at reaction time t, respectively, and mash is the mass
of the ash.

The reaction rate (r) was calculated
from the mass ratio versus time profile as follows 2  

The CO2 gasification kinetics
were estimated by the
RPM proposed by Bhatia and Perlmutter12 and Gavals,14 which is valid when summarized
with the derivations and procedures developed for the evaluation.

The overall reaction rate is given by 3  where ψ is the structural parameter
of the initial char structure and k is the rate constant
of the gasification reaction.

Char Characterization by SEM and BET
A Nova Nano SEM
450 microscope (FEI Company, United States) and an ASAP 2020 BET apparatus
was employed to analyze the surface areas and pore structures of the
samples.

Char Characterization by XRD
An UItima IV diffractometer
irradiated with Cu KR radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) was used to
detect the crystallite structures of the samples.

The specific
methods of the SEM, BET, and XRD analyses can be obtained in our previous
work.40

Char Characterization by Raman Spectroscopy
All selected
samples (10–20 randomly chosen particles) were analyzed in
a DXR Raman spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with an Nd–YAG
laser (532 nm) and a confocal microscope with three objective lenses.
The laser power on the sample surface was controlled to approximately
6 mW. The spot diameter of the laser beam reaching the sample was
1.2 μm. The spectra were recorded in the 800–2000 cm–1 wavenumber range, covering the first-order bands
of the samples. All spectra were processed by a linear baseline correction,
and the bands were fitted in the 800–2000 cm–1 region by PeakFit4.2 software. Finally, the positions, intensities,
widths, and areas of the bands were determined.

The FTIR spectra were
recorded from 4000 to 650 cm–1 (40 averaged scans
with a resolution of 2 cm–1) on a vertex 80 FTIR
spectrometer (Bruker, province, country) with a UATR attachment using
KBr pellets. The pellets were made from a mixture of demineralized
char sample and KBr in the ratio of 1:150. All spectra were processed
by a linear baseline correction, and their peaks in the 2600–4000
and 650–1800 cm–1 regions were fitted by
PeakFit4.2 software. The band positions, intensities, widths, and
areas were then determined. The area ratios of aliphatic carbon (Cal) to aromatic carbon (Car) were obtained from the fitting spectra.
