Poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) is a transparent and flexible elastomer
which has a myriad of applications in various fields including organic
electronics. However, the inherent hydrophobic nature and low surface
energy of PDMS prevent its direct use in many applications. It is
seldom utilized as a gate dielectric in solution-processed organic
field effect transistors (OFETs). In this work, we demonstrate a simple
method, extended ultraviolet–ozone (UVO) treatment, to modify
the PDMS surface and effectively employ it in solution-processed OFETs
as a gate dielectric material. The modified PDMS surface shows enhanced
wettability and adherence to both polar and nonpolar liquids, which
is contrary to the generally observed hydrophilic nature of UVO-treated
PDMS surfaces because of the creation of polar functional groups.
The morphological changes happening on the PDMS surface as a result
of extended UVO treatment play a major role in making the surface
suitable for all type of solvents discussed here. The contact angle
measurements are used to give qualitative evidence for this observation.
The modified PDMS is then used as a gate dielectric in solution-processed
n- and p-channel OFETs using [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl
ester (PC60BM) and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene)
(rr-P3HT) semiconductors, respectively.

1 Introduction
Poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) is a highly flexible, chemically
inert, and inherently hydrophobic silicone elastomer.1−3The high optical transparency, flexibility, and solution processability
make this material attractive for many technological applications
such as soft lithography, microcontact printing, microfluidics, and
medical and optical devices.4−9 Because of its reversible stretchability and flexibility, PDMS is
often employed in flexible electronic devices such as organic field
effect transistors (OFETs),10,11 organic light emitting
diodes,12 ac thin film electroluminescent
devices,13 and solar cells.14 For the fabrication of flexible devices such
as OFETs, solution-processing methods spin-coating, dip-coating, and
ink-jet printing are preferred to expensive techniques such as physical
vapor deposition because of ease of processability, cost-effectiveness,
and the ability to cover a large area.15,16 However, direct
deposition of organic materials on PDMS by solution-processing methods
is considered a challenging task because the organic semiconductors
(OSCs) dissolved in nonpolar solvents show poor wettability and adherence
on the PDMS surface in spite of its inherent hydrophobic nature.17 This has created major obstacles in making solution-processed
multilayer devices on PDMS.2,18

Surface treatments
are often used to improve the wetting characteristics
of polymers prior to their use in different applications. The commonly
adopted techniques for PDMS surface modification are ultraviolet–ozone
(UVO) treatment, oxygen plasma treatment, corona discharge, and other
chemical treatments.19−22 Except for the large processing time, UVO treatment is a milder
and less expensive technique compared to other surface treatment methods.19−22 It is reported that UVO treatment modifies the PDMS surface to hydrophilic
with the creation of polar functional groups on its surface and hence
wets the polar solvents.19,23 This does not solve
the wettability and adherence issue with nonpolar solvents on the
PDMS surface. In the present work, we describe a simple method called
extended UVO treatment to improve the wettability and adherence of
both nonpolar and polar solvents on the PDMS surface.

PDMS is
commonly used as a supporting layer in flexible organic
devices.24,25 Because of its good dielectric properties,
PDMS is a suitable material as a gate dielectric in OFETs.5,26 In previous reports where PDMS is used as a gate dielectric, the
active materials are either thermally evaporated or their single crystals
are physically placed between the channels.5,10,18,27 To the best
of our knowledge, PDMS is not used as a gate dielectric in solution-processed
OFETs. Here, we employed the surface-treated PDMS as a gate dielectric
in n- and p-channel OFETs by direct solution-casting of active materials,
dissolved in nonpolar solvents, on PDMS. The n- and p-type semiconducting
materials used in the study are [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid ester
(PC60BM) and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT),
respectively. The OFETs thus fabricated show good electrical characteristics.
The enhanced wettability of organic solutions on the PDMS surface
using a simple UVO treatment method can create a good impact on fields
such as organic electronics and microfluidics where high flexibility,
transparency, and solution processability are desirable.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of UVO Treatment
on Wettability and
Adhesion
The wetting nature of untreated PDMS to polar and
nonpolar solvents is examined using contact angle (CA) measurements
(Figure 1). The hydrophobicity1 of PDMS is evident from the large water CA (∼115°),
as shown in Figure 1a. The nonpolar solvents, which are used to dissolve the semiconducting
polymer/molecule used in this study, are expected to wet the PDMS
surface before any surface treatment as the CAs of these solutions
are small (∼20°) (Figure 1c,e). This is in accordance with the theory of wetting
that a hydrophobic surface naturally gets wetted with nonpolar solvents;28,29 but we have observed that during spin-coating, the nonpolar organic
solutions spilt out from the PDMS surface and failed to form a thin
layer on it. This nonadhesive behavior of nonpolar solutions on the
PDMS surface can be mainly due to the insufficient surface energy
possessed by PDMS.17,20,21,30,31 We carried
out UVO treatment on the PDMS surface for different exposure times
and found that an extended UVO treatment for about 60 min resulted
in a large reduction in the CA values (which is a measure of the surface
energy)32 for both polar and nonpolar liquids.
The water CA was reduced from 115° to 34°, and the CAs of
chlorobenzene and chloroform were reduced from 20° to 3°
and 7°, respectively (Figure 1d,f). The spin-coated organic solutions on the UVO-treated
PDMS layer showed perfect wetting and adhesion and formed uniform
thin layers (schematic representation is given in Figure 2). The high wettability of
polar and nonpolar solvents on the extended UVO-treated PDMS surface
point out that the PDMS surface has undergone a noticeable modification
in addition to the creation of polar functionalities on its surface.
Such improved wetting and adhesion can be explained based on the presence
of chemical entities on the PDMS surface as well as its surface morphology.19,33

2.2 Chemical
Modification on the PDMS Surface
Attenuated total reflectance–Fourier
transform infrared
spectroscopy (ATR–FTIR) measurements can be used to identify
different chemical functionalities present on the PDMS surface before
and after UVO treatment. In Figure 3a–e, ATR–FTIR spectra of PDMS at different
UVO exposure times are given. PDMS has a series of characteristic
infrared bands.19 among these, the most
intense ones were obtained for those associated with asymmetric −CH3 stretching in Si–CH3 (2950–2970
cm–1), symmetric −CH3 deformation
in Si–CH3 (1245–1270 cm–1), stretching vibration of Si–O–Si bonds (1000–1100
cm–1), −CH3 rocking, and Si–C
stretching vibrations in Si–CH3 (785–815
cm–1).19,34,35 These bands are common for untreated and UVO-treated PDMS. However,
we observed that with increasing UVO exposure time, a broad region
appeared around 3050–3700 cm–1, as shown
in Figure 3f, which
corresponds to the polar functional group, hydroxyl (−OH).
Also, bands corresponding to Si–O stretching vibrations in
silanol (Si–OH) appeared with an increase in the UVO exposure
time in the regions between 825–865 and 875–920 cm–1 (Figure S3). Simultaneously,
the band corresponding to Si–C vibration was decreased (Figure S4). The reactive oxygen radicals formed
during UVO exposure are responsible for the conversion of methyl (−CH3) groups to silanol (Si–OH) groups.35 The increase of −OH functional groups on the PDMS
surface makes it more and more hydrophilic as the time of exposure
increases.19−23

and (f) −OH peaks at different UVO exposure time.

2.3 Morphological Changes on
the PDMS Surface
The role of morphological changes in determining
the wetting characteristics
of PDMS was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of untreated PDMS and 60 min
UVO-treated PDMS surface (Figure 4a–f). The images show that UVO treatment completely
altered the surface morphology, featuring the formation of wrinkles
with hills and valleys. From the AFM images, the root mean square
(rms) roughness of the annealed PDMS surface was found to be ∼10
nm. Upon extended UVO treatment, the roughness almost doubled to ∼20
nm (roughness data are given in Table 1). The mechanism of wrinkle formation can be explained
based on the high viscoelasticity of PDMS. High viscoelasticity results
in mechanical stress in spin-coated PDMS thin films.10,36 Thermal curing and subsequent cooling release this stress, which
results in the formation of wrinkles on the surface.10 Further, the prolonged UVO irradiation causes an increment
in surface wrinkling resulting in high surface roughness.34,36 An increase in the surface roughness can also be caused by the evaporation
of volatile fragments from the PDMS surface while the siloxane component
is converted to silicon oxides.34,37,38 This is similar to the observed nanostructuring in oxygen plasma-treated
PDMS.22 The reason for the high degree
of wetting by nonpolar liquids on the modified PDMS surface can be
attributed to the increased surface roughness.28,39 The increased surface roughness effectively increases its surface
area. A low viscous liquid can easily penetrate into the deep narrow
valleys, causing a reduction in the CA, and allow complete spreading,39 which then forms a thin film during spin-coating.

PDMS spin-coated on a glass substrate; (e,f) show the three-dimensional

2.4 Dielectric-Semiconductor Interface Morphology
The dielectric–semiconductor
interface of an OFET plays
a crucial role in determining the channel formed between the source
and drain electrodes because of the applied electric field.31,40 Any defect in the interface can cause the formation of trap states,
deteriorating its operating values.31 The
solvents used for dissolving the OSCs can cause swelling of the underlying
dielectric, which may reduce the interface quality. The swelling ability
of solvents on PDMS used in this study are in the order chloroform
> cyclohexane > chlorobenzene.41 We
observed
that because of the moderate solubility of PDMS in chlorobenzene,
the PDMS layer lying beneath the P3HT layer was negligibly affected.
Though PDMS is highly soluble in chloroform,41 it did not affect the underneath layer in the device because of
the high volatility of chloroform. In a bottom gate device, surface
properties of the dielectric can influence the morphology and molecular
organization of the OSC coated on top of it.31 Surface morphology of PDMS coated with the OSC solutions was evaluated
using AFM and SEM images (Figure 5). The roughness data of films are given in Table 1. From the images,
it is clear that the OSC layers follow the underneath wrinkled morphology
of PDMS. The wrinkles are more visible in the case of the rr-P3HT
layer because it is thinner than the PC60BM layer. Nevertheless,
the images show that the continuity of the active layer is not lost.

AFM images (three-dimensional) of rr-P3HT and PC60BM on
the UVO-treated PDMS film, respectively.

2.5 X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
Besides morphology, the surface property of the gate dielectric can
influence the crystallinity of the OSC layer.42 We carried out XRD analysis of the surface-treated PDMS thin film
and the organic active layers coated on the modified PDMS film. The
results are compared with the unmodified PDMS thin film and the untreated
organic active layers spin-coated on glass substrates (Figure 6). The XRD patterns of untreated
PDMS and surface-treated PDMS show similar characteristics. We observed
a characteristic broad peak at a 2θ value of 12.2° in the
XRD patterns of PDMS thin films before and after extended UVO treatment
(Figure 6a), indicating
the amorphous nature of PDMS.43 A noticeable
variation in the ordering is also not observed for organic layers
coated on glass and on the UVO-treated PDMS layer. The XRD pattern
of rr-P3HT shows a crystalline nature with characteristic peaks around
5.6° and 11.2° corresponding to the crystal planes (100)
and (200), respectively (Figure 6b), indicating a stacked structure.44,45 The sharp peaks at 2θ values of 7.6° and 10.7° and
the small distinct peaks at around 20° in the XRD pattern of
PC60BM indicate its crystalline nature.46 From the above observations, we conclude that the UVO-treated
PDMS layer with enormous surface irregularities does not alter the
basic crystallinity of the OSC materials coated on top of it. A broad
region (from 15° to 35°) seen in all XRD data is the effect
of the glass substrate on which the layers are coated. While examining
the XRD patterns with and without the surface-treated PDMS layer,
the peak intensity is not considered as an indication of improved
crystalline nature. It is because the layered structure of PDMS can
cause accumulation of OSC on the valleys and formation of a thin layer
on the hills; so the intensity of peaks can vary depending on the
area of focus.47

film, and (c) PC60BM thin-film on a glass substrate and

2.6 Capacitance–Voltage Measurements
The basic requirements of a gate dielectric material are its high
dielectric constant (εr), high geometric capacitance
(Ci), and the ability to produce a good
quality interface with the semiconductor to ensure good field effect
for proper transistor operation. With the favorable interface properties
of PDMS/OSC as obtained earlier, we evaluated εr and Ci of PDMS for its application in OFETs using
capacitance–voltage(C–V) measurements. The C–V characteristics
of the dielectric material evaluate the charge accumulation and discharge
capabilities of the material and hence verify its capability to be
used as a dielectric in transistors. We used metal–insulator–metal
(MIM) (Al/PDMS/Al) and metal–insulator–semiconductor
(MIS) (Al/PDMS/rr-P3HT) configurations to perform the quasi-static C–V measurements, and the plots
are shown in Figure S5. From the C–V measurements of the MIM capacitor,
the dielectric constant of the material was obtained as ∼2.32
(at 1 kHz frequency), which is in agreement with the literature values
(εr = 2.3–2.8 from 1 MHz to 100 Hz).26 The capacitance per unit area of the device
(Ci) was obtained as ∼1.03 nF/cm2. The MIS capacitor showed typical p-type behavior with inversion–depletion
and accumulation regions as the gate voltage is swept from +30 to
−30 V.

2.7 OFET Characterization
The n-channel
(with PC60BM) and p-channel (with rr-P3HT) OFET devices
exhibit typical current–voltage (I–V) characteristics when characterized in air and vacuum.
The p-channel OFETs show saturation of drain current at low negative
gate voltages but do not show a clear saturation region at high gate
voltages (Figure 7a).
This nature is expected because of the high level of oxygen doping
in rr-P3HT, causing a significant increase in conductivity and thereby
increasing the channel current. When the channel current is high enough
to dominate the field effect, the channel fails to pinch-off.48,49 This effect is similar to the short-channel effect, which is a result
of the thick dielectric layer compared to the channel length.50 The perfect linearity at low drain voltages
indicates Ohmic contacts between the source–drain electrodes
and the active material. The best value for linear mobility of p-channel
OFET is found to be 6.81 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1 and the current on/off
ratio is 0.21 × 103 (at VDS = −60 V), when the measurements are done in air. The linear
mobility and current on/off ratio in vacuum are obtained as 3.38 ×
10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1 and 0.73 × 102 (at VDS = −60 V), respectively. The threshold voltages
observed in vacuum and air are −10 and 10 V, respectively.
The observed change in polarity is again attributed to the increased
conductivity of rr-P3HT in air because of the unintentional oxygen
doping.51 The positive threshold voltage
and the high off current for devices characterized in air imply that
the conductivity of rr-P3HT is not negligible even in a reverse-biased
condition. Oxygen doping at the exposed regions of rr-P3HT increases
the conductivity of the channel, thereby increasing the off current,
causing a decrease in the on/off ratio and also resulting in overestimated
mobility values.51,52

Figure 7 (a) Output characteristics (IDS–VDS) and (b) transfer
characteristics (IDS–VGS) of
the p-channel OFET characterized in air; (c) output characteristics
(IDS–VDS) and (d) transfer characteristics (IDS–VGS) of the n-channel OFET characterized
in vacuum.

The n-channel OFETs show good
FET output characteristics in both
air and vacuum. The IDS–VDS curves are linear at low drain voltages and
saturate at high drain voltages. The threshold voltage of the device
is ∼30 V, and the drain current is of the order of 10–6 A for a voltage range from 0 to 100 V, when characterized in vacuum.
The mobility in the saturation regime is obtained as 0.81 ×
10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1 and that in the linear regime at a low drain voltage
(VDS = 8 V) is obtained as 6.33 ×
10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1 in vacuum. The current on/off ratio is of the order
of 102 (at VDS = 90 V) (Figure 7c,d). Unlike rr-P3HT,
the PC60BM semiconductor material degrades in an ambient
atmosphere, and the OFET device performance is affected. The output
characteristics of the p- and n-channel OFETs in vacuum and air, respectively,
are shown in Figure S6. The characteristic
values of both n- and p- channel OFETs are listed in Table S1 of the Supporting Information.

The transfer characteristics
of both OFET devices show a small
hysteresis as shown in Figure S7. In OFETs,
the hysteresis can occur because of several reasons, such as charge-carrier
trapping close to the channel, presence of mobile ions in the dielectric,
or slow polarization of the dielectric.53 As discussed earlier, the increased roughness of the PDMS layer
leads to the creation of wrinkles in the channel region, which may
act as charge-carrier traps.31 We obtained
hysteresis-free characteristics with slow sweeping rates (Figure S7). This observation suggests the presence
of trapped majority or minority charges in the channel near the semiconductor/dielectric
interface. Even though the roughness in the dielectric is detrimental
to the dielectric/semiconductor interface quality, the transistor
performance is not affected by this factor. The mobility values obtained
from the OFET devices are comparable to the reported values for rr-P3HT
and PC60BM semiconductors. The reasonable device performance,
even with the wrinkled morphology of the PDMS dielectric, can be attributed
to the presence of a strong localized electric field at the valleys
of the wrinkles.54

3 Conclusions
In summary, we modified the surface of PDMS
by using extended UVO
treatment and enabled the adhesion of both polar and nonpolar solvents
on its surface. The presence of hydroxyl groups and the wrinkled morphology
together contributed to the increase in its surface energy and thereby
improved the wetting and adhesion. The modified PDMS was then utilized
as a gate dielectric in solution-processed active layer-based OFETs.
The n- and p-channel OFETs using solution-processed OSCs, PC60BM and rr-P3HT, showed characteristics typical for the corresponding
OFETs. The present study demonstrates the potential of PDMS as a gate
dielectric in solution-processed FETs and suggests its applicability
in solution-processed multilayer flexible devices.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Materials
PDMS
(Sylgard 184) along
with the curing agent were purchased from Dow Corning. The semiconductors,
rr-P3HT and PC60BM, were procured from American Dye Source
Inc.

4.2 PDMS Surface Modification and Surface Property
studies
PDMS, mixed with the curing agent in a 10:1 ratio
and diluted in cyclohexane (PDMS/cyclohexane = 1:2), was spin-coated
onto cleaned glass substrates at a speed of 6000 rpm. The thickness
of the layer was found to be ∼2 μm (measured using an
Alpha-Step D-600 Stylus Profiler, KLA-Tencor). After thermal annealing
for 30 min at 150 °C, the layers were treated with a UVO cleaner
(UVOCS, USA) for different time durations. A low-pressure quartz-mercury
vapor lamp of output power 9 mW/cm2, which generates UV
emissions in the 254 and 185 nm range, was used as the UV source.

CA measurements (CA Meter, Holmarc) were done with water and organic
solutions of rr-P3HT and PC60BM by dissolving them in chlorobenzene
and chloroform solvents, respectively. The method used to qualitatively
find the wetting nature and surface energy from CA measurements is
given in the Supporting Information (Figure
S1). The FTIR–ATR spectra of untreated PDMS and UVO-treated
PDMS at different exposure times were measured using a Bruker Alpha-E
FTIR spectrometer equipped with a ZnSe crystal. The surface morphologies
of untreated PDMS (only annealed at 150 °C), UVO-treated PDMS,
and OSC coated on PDMS were investigated using AFM (Bruker multimode
8 AFM) and SEM (Nova NanoSEM 450 FEI) techniques. The effect of UVO
treatment on the PDMS surface and thereby on the ordering of the OSC
layer spin-coated on PDMS were investigated using XRD (Empyrean, PANalytical
XRD instrument with Cu Kα radiation) measurements.

4.3 Dielectric Property Studies
The capacitance–voltage
(C–V) measurements of the
PDMS dielectric were carried out in its MIM (Al/PDMS/Al) and MIS (Al/PDMS-P3HT)
configurations at 1 kHz. The measurements were done using a Keithley
SCS 4200 semiconductor parameter analyzer.

4.4 Fabrication
and Characterization of OFETs
OFET devices were fabricated
in the bottom gate-top contact configuration
(Figure S2) on cleaned glass substrates
with rr-P3HT and PC60BM as active layers and extended UVO-treated
PDMS as the gate dielectric. Thermally evaporated aluminum of thickness
∼80 nm served as the gate electrode (monitored using INFICON
quartz thickness monitor). The PDMS film spin-coated on the Al gate
electrode was then cured at 150 °C for 30 min and UVO-treated
for about 60 min before semiconductor coating. The optimized values
of concentration, spin speed, and annealing temperatures were used
for active layer coating. The OSCs, rr-P3HT, and PC60BM
were spin-coated on PDMS from a solution of 10 mg/mL in chlorobenzene
and 20 mg/mL in chloroform, respectively, at a spin speed of ∼800
rpm. The rr-P3HT layer was annealed at 110 °C for 30 min, and
PC60BM was annealed at 60 °C for 10 min. The thicknesses
of rr-P3HT and PC60BM were 60 and 250 nm, respectively.
Gold source–drain electrodes were evaporated onto the OSC layers
leaving a channel length (L) of 50 μm between
the source and drain electrodes, keeping the channel width (W) at 2 mm.

The OFET devices were fabricated in a
nitrogen atmosphere. The characterization was done in air as well
as in vacuum conditions using a Keithley SCS 4200 semiconductor parameter
analyzer. We calculated the field-effect mobilities (μlin and μsat) of OFETs in the linear and saturation
regimes of operation using following eqs 1 and 2, respectively:

Current
in the linear regime 1  

Current
in the saturation regime 2  where W (2 mm) and L (50 μm) are the transistor channel
width and length,
respectively, VTh is the threshold voltage,
and Ci is the capacitance per unit area
of the PDMS gate dielectric.
