Interpenetrating polymer networks
(IPNs) based on triisocyanate-terminated
poly(urethane-imide)s (PUIs) were prepared by in situ interpenetrating
reactions between modified polyurethane (PU) with different ratios
of polyimide (PI). The effects of PU, which was made from hydroxyl-terminated
polybutadiene modified with triisocyanate, and the amounts of PI on
the mechanical properties, thermal properties, and crystalline character
of the IPNs were discussed. Triisocyanate-terminated PUI showed that
the highest tensile strength was 38 times that of the diisocyanate-terminated
materials. Supramolecular cross-linking from an additional hydrogen-bonding
network of modified PU and the degree of interpenetration with a regular
imide structure of PI were introduced, which accounted for the remarkable
improvement in mechanical properties of IPNs. Preferable thermal stability
and glass transition temperature for the hard segment of IPNs were
rewarded with increasing PI content. X-ray diffraction revealed vigorous
segmental mixing between the soft and hard segments of modified PUI.
Scanning electron micrographs showed the “fibrous assembly”
morphology and short-range-ordered structure of modified PUI.

Introduction
Because of desirable
microphase separation, biocompatibility, biodegradability,
swelling capacity, chemical resistivity, abrasion resistance, bondability,
and photostability, interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) of poly(urethane-imide)s
(PUIs) are attractive candidates for application in fields such as
damping materials, hydrogels, plastic blending modification, reinforcing
rubber, adhesives, optical materials, functional membranes, drug delivery,
and so forth.1−14

According to the literature, the IPN topology was long known.15−19 The first patents recommended the employment of IPNs to prepare
smooth sheets of block-polymerized homopolymers in Britain, as of
July, 1941.20 Millar was the first person
to use the concept “IPNs” and prepared IPNs from identical
styrene-divinyl benzene production with polymer networks I and II.21 IPNs are the combination of two or more polymer
networks which are interlaced on a polymer scale.22−24 At least partially
blended on a molecular scale but not covalently bonded to each other,
IPNs cannot be separated only if chemical bonds are broken.25 A mass of studies are reported in the literature
about the IPNs of PUI. The majority of these research studies consider
thermostability, aging resistance, oxidation resistance, and, particularly,
mechanical properties.24,26−30 Most researchers improved the mechanical properties
by regulating the polyimide (PI)/polyurethane (PU) ratio.31 Some researchers used various diisocyanates,
such as 4,4′-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate (H12MDI), hexame-thylene diisocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate, diphenyl
methane diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), and so on, to
achieve outstanding properties of PUI.2,31−39 Earlier reports showed that mechanical properties were improved
by adding more diol functionalities or by increasing the −NCO/–OH
mole ratio in the polymerization of diisocyanate-terminated PUI.40,41 As reported in the literature, the modified PU, chain extender,
and cross-linking agent were also added to prepared PUI with desirable
properties.10,42,43 However, increasing mechanical properties of triisocyanate-terminated
PUI with modified PU is not known in the literature.

In the
present study, IPNs based on triisocyanate-terminated PUIs
were prepared. The mechanical properties, effective cross-linking,
thermal stability, and crystalline character of the IPNs were investigated
and discussed.

Results and Discussion
Mechanical Properties
Tensile strength, elongation
at break, elastic modulus of all samples, and several kinds of diisocyanate-terminated
materials are given in Table 1; the elastic modulus is calculated from the slope of the
linear portion of the stress–strain plot, where Hooke’s
law is maintained.33,35,44 It can be seen that the tensile strength and elastic modulus obtained
in our work are noteworthily superior to those of diisocyanate-terminated
materials; the tensile strength of PUI-2-0.4 is 38 times that of hydroxyl-terminated
polybutadiene (HTPB)/IPDI and the elastic modulus of PUI-2-0.4 is
12 times that of HTPB/IPDI. The phenomenon may be owing to triisocyanate-terminated
PUI forming IPN structures other than the linear polymer; the degree
of interpenetrating is large, which can sustain stronger stress.

Stress–strain plots show clearly
that in all cases, the
tensile properties of PU-2/PUI-2 are superior to those of PU-1/PUI-1,
and a simultaneous increase in tensile strength, elongation at break,
and elastic modulus occurs. A clearer picture can be realized from
the data shown in Table 1; the tensile strength of PUI-2 increases by 2.83–6.43 MPa
compared to that of PUI-1, which is the greatest and is about 1.9
times that of unmodified PUI. The elongation at break of PUI-2 increases
by 24.09–69.77% compared to that of PUI-1, and the elastic
modulus of PUI-2 increases by 0.005–0.043 MPa compared to that
of PUI-1. It is attributed to supramolecular cross-linking from the
additional hydrogen-bonding network in modified PUI.

It can
be seen that the tensile strength and elastic modulus increase
first up to a maximum and then decrease with increasing PI content.
The tensile strength increases from 2.84 to 7.29 MPa and then falls
to 3.22 MPa. The elastic modulus increases from 0.027 to 0.101 MPa
and then to 0.046 MPa; PUI-1-0.4 has the maximum in the series of
PUI-1. In the series of PUI-2, the tensile strength increases from
5.67 to 13.72 MPa and then to 10.09 MPa, the elastic modulus increases
from 0.032 to 0.133 MPa and then to 0.089 MPa, and PUI-2-0.4 has the
maximum. The results may be explained to be because of the fact that
the regular and rigid imide structure is introduced into PUI; the
interaction between the molecular chains is stronger, and the cohesive
energy and the degree of interpenetration are more abundant. The PI
molecule plays the cross-linking point role, and the maximum values
in the tensile strength and elastic modulus are the balanced points
of the interpenetrating degree and the soft segment of PU. The tensile
strength and elastic modulus go down when the ratio of PI/PU reaches
0.5. It is probably attributed to the formation of clusters of superfluous
PI molecules, which increase the boundary stress under tensile loading,
and the IPNs are broken.

As shown in Figure 1, the elongation at break decreases first
to a minimum and then increases
with increasing PI content. The elongation at break falls from 105.06
to 71.65% and then increases to 90.56%; PUI-1-0.4 has the minimum
in the series of PUI-1. In the series of PUI-2, the elongation at
break decreases from 174.83 to 98.98% and then increases to 114.65%,
and PUI-2-0.4 has the minimum. It is probably attributed to the fact
that the interaction between the molecular chains is stronger and
a free motion cannot occur with increasing PI content, and a decrease
in the toughness of the matrix from the increasing degree of interpenetration
as a result of the network structure occurs. The elongation at break
increases when the ratio of PI/PU reaches 0.5. The results may be
explained to be because the soft segment becomes more incompatible
and more crystallizable with hard parts as the PI content increases
in the PUI.

PI contents.

Thermal Properties
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
of all samples is shown in Figure 2. To eliminate the influence of impurities and solvents,
20% (T20%) and 50% (T50%) weight loss temperatures and the residual weight
at 700 °C (RW700) are given in Table 2. It is not difficult
to discover that T20% values of PUI-1
and PUI-2 increase by about 7–48 and 6–35 °C compared
to those of PU-1 and PU-2. T50% values
of PUI-1 and PUI-2 improve by around 7–47 and 5–38 °C
compared with those of PU-1 and PU-2. RW700 values of PUI-1 and PUI-2 increase by about 1.61–7.86 and
2.9–8.81%, respectively. Compared with PU-1/PU-2, the decomposition
temperature of PUI-1/PUI-2 is elevated to a higher temperature by
introducing a PI. As expected, PUI shows higher thermal stability,
which is probably attributed to the cohesion between soft and hard
segment increasing in contrast to PU. It is due to a strong dipole–dipole
interaction between hard segments in PUI chains, resulting in the
microzone of PUI responsible for the improvement of thermal properties.

Segmental mixing and
microphase separation can be observed by Tg. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and
dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) analysis are shown in Table 3, Figures 3, and 4. DSC and DMA
indicate the glass transition temperature for soft segment (Tgs) values of PUI-1 to be −69.24 to −62.23
°C (Figure 3a)
and Tgs values of PUI-2 to be −67.28
to −60.61 °C.45 The phenomenon
may be owing to the modification of PU with dinitrobenzene (DNB),
and PI content does not transform the Tgs. PU-1 does not display glass transition temperature for the hard
segment (Tgh); however, PU-2 reveals Tgh at 172.23 °C. Tgh values of PUI-1 elevate from 156.76 to 179.6 °C and
PUI-2 elevate from 172.23 to 195.2 °C. The result indicates that
the hanging DNB in the PU-2 backbone yielding extra hydrogen generates
a larger segmental mixing degree between hard and soft segments, and
IPNs possess higher segmental mixing with increasing PI content.

X-ray Studies
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of PU-1/PUI-1 and PU-2/PUI-2 are shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5, PU-1/PUI-1 similarly presents a broad diffraction
peak within the range of 15–25°, which indicates that
PU-1/PUI-1 displays amorphous character. However, PU-2/PUI-2 shows
sharp crystalline peaks at 2θ = 14.32, 16.52, 20.22, 21.78,
28.64, and 30.26. PU-2/PUI-2, in a more ordered way, generating strong
crystalline peaks, may be because of higher segmental mixing. It can
be accounted for by the interactions between the modified soft segment
and backbone of PUI.

Morphological Study
To reveal the
morphological features
in PU/PUI, the cross sections of PU-1, PUI-1-0.4, PU-2, and PUI-2-0.4
were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Figure 6. PU-1 is almost
featureless, and PUI-1-0.4 has a flexural and interlacing structure
like a typical elastomer feature. The structure of PUI-1-0.4 may be
built up from multiple branches of molecular chains. The morphological
features of PU-2 and PUI-2-0.4 are strikingly different between PU-1
and PUI-1-0.4, which possess intersected and tangled fibers in order
to achieve the “fibrous assembly” types. The micrograph
of PU-2 can be explained to be because of the hanging DNB in the PU
backbone yielding extra hydrogen bonding, and moreover, PUI-2-0.4
shows supramolecular cross-linking from the additional hydrogen-bonding
network. The fractured surface of PUI-2-0.4 possesses more roughness
than PU-2, and both have short-range-ordered structures, in agreement
with the results of XRD. The discrepancy of micrographs can be accounted
for by the conspicuous improvement in mechanical properties.

Conclusions
IPNs based on triisocyanate-terminated
PUIs were synthesized using
modified PU with PI. The work definitely demonstrated that modified
PUIs possessed supramolecular cross-linking from additional hydrogen-bonding
networks and contained dipole–dipole couplings in chains. Therefore,
modified PUIs presented superior mechanical properties, thermal stability,
glass transition temperature for hard segments, and higher segmental
mixing. Microtopography of the modified PUIs showed the “fibrous
assembly” and short-range order.

Experimental Section
Materials
HTPB (OH value = 0.76 mmol g–1) was supplied
by Liming Research & Design Institute of Chemical
Industry Co., Ltd., China. JQ-1 (triphenylmethane-4,4′,4″-triisocyanate
solid content = 20%) was purchased from Liaoning Hongshan Chemical
Co., Ltd., China. 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB), 1,2,4,5-benzene
tetracarboxylic anhydride (PMDA), and sodium hydride (NaH) were received
from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. All chemicals were used without
further purification.

Characterization Techniques
Proton Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance and Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy
The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ascend 400 MHz NMR
spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded
in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 on a Bruker
ALPHA spectrometer.

Determination of the Molecular Weight
The molecular
weights of HTPB-DNB were recorded by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC, Waters 515 HPLC) with a refractive index detector (Waters 2414).
HPLC-grade tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used as the mobile phase. HTPB-DNB
solutions in THF with a concentration of 3.0 mg mL–1 were injected in the GPC column (Styragel HR2 THF) with a flow rate
of 0.4 mL min–1. Narrow molecular weight distribution
polystyrene standards (Polymer Standards Service) with a polydispersity
index of ≤ 1.1 were used in GPC molecular weight calibration.

Mechanical Studies
The tensile strength measurement
(stress–strain relationship) was carried out on a universal
testing machine (CMT6103, Mechanical Testing & Simulation). Dumbbell
specimens were cut following GB/T528-2009 (Type VI specimen). The
tensile properties of all films were measured in an air atmosphere
at room temperature with a crosshead speed of 200 mm min–1. For each sample, at least three specimens were tested in the machine
to check the reproducibility.

Thermal Studies
TGA was performed on a DTG-60 instrument
(Shimadzu, Beijing, China) at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 from room temperature to 600 °C under a nitrogen
atmosphere with a flow rate of 100 mL min–1. The
glass transition temperature (Tg) was
assessed with a DSC 200F3 analyzer (NETZSCH, Beijing, China). A vacant
aluminum crucible was used as a reference. The samples were heated
at a rate of 5 °C min–1 from −100 to
50 °C under a N2 atmosphere. The DMA was carried out
by means of a thermal analyzer (TA Instruments model Q-800) from −100
to 300 °C, at a frequency of 1 Hz and heating rate of 3 °C
min–1.

X-ray Diffraction
The crystalloid
phase of the samples
was investigated by XRD on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer with
a scanning rate of 8° min–1 in the 2θ
range from 3 to 50°.

Microscopy Study
A scanning electron
microscope (BCPCAS4800)
was used to observe the morphology of PUI. The PU/PUI films were brittle
and fractured in liquid nitrogen, and the cross sections were selected
for analysis. Moreover, all the samples were sputter-coated with gold
before analysis.

Synthesis of HTPB-DNB
The terminated
carbon atom functionalization
was carried out by attaching the DNCB molecules covalently using a
previously developed method.46,47 Briefly, the procedure
for the synthesis of HTPB-DNB was as follows: 10 g of HTPB [n(OH) = 7.6 mmol] was taken in a three-neck round bottom
flask and dissolved in 20 mL of distilled dichloromethane. After complete
dissolution, 1.824 g (76 mmol) of NaH was added in the presence of
purging nitrogen gas. After 30 min, 1.539 g (7.6 mmol) of DNCB was
added to the reaction mixture. Stirring was continued for another
3 h in the presence of nitrogen gas followed by overnight stirring.
After that, the product was washed with hexane and methanol repeatedly
to obtain HTPB-DNB. The resultant product has the following physical
characteristics: 1H NMR spectra (Figure S1) of HTPB, DNCB, and HTPB-DNB in CDCl3: Ar–H
protons of HTPB-DNB are observed at 8.69–7.13 ppm. The chemical
shifts obtained are matching very well with the expected structure.
The presence of DNB moieties in the case of HTPB-DNB is visible in
the spectra and hence confirms the structure of the synthesized HTPB-DNB. Mn = 6568, polymer dispersity index = 1.92, and
hydroxyl value = 0.618 mmol g–1. The synthetic route
and chemical structure of HTPB-DNB are shown in Scheme S1b.

Synthesis of PU-1 Solution
HTPB
(10 g) was added to
a three-neck round bottom flask. One neck of the flask was used for
pouring reactants, one neck was fitted with a guard tube, and in another
neck, nitrogen gas was purged to maintain the inert atmosphere. The
moles of hydroxyl obtained were 7.6 mmol, calculated from the hydroxyl
value of HTPB. JQ-1 was 5.578 g to maintain the stoichiometric balance
between n(OH)/n(NCO) = 1/1.2. JQ-1
was added to the flask. The reaction mixture was stirred in the presence
of a nitrogen atmosphere until well mixed, and a homogeneous solution
was obtained. The synthetic route and chemical structure of PU-1 are
shown in Scheme S1a.

Synthesis of
PU-2 Solution
A similar method, as described
above, was followed for the preparation of PU-2. HTPB-DNB [10 g, n(OH) = 6.18 mmol] and 4.536 g of JQ-1 were used for the
preparation of PU-2. All other reaction conditions and curing time
and temperature were kept similar as they were in the case of PU-1.
The synthetic route and chemical structure of PU-2 are shown in Scheme S1b. FT-IR spectra of HTPB, HTPB-DNB,
DNCB, PU-1, and PU-2 frequencies are shown in Figure S2. Figure S2 indicates
that the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of −NO2 (at 1546 and 1349 cm–1, in the DNCB spectrum in
the figure) is shifted toward lower wavenumbers (1534 and 1339 cm–1) and are significantly broader in the case of PU-2.
The lower-frequency −NH peak in the case of PU-2 (3322 cm–1) compared to PU-1 (3340 cm–1) signifies
that perhaps more free −NH groups are available in the former
PU-1 than PU-2. This, confirmed from the −C=O peak,
appears at 1737 cm–1 in the case of PU-2, whereas
it is at 1730 cm–1 in the case of PU-1. The free
−NH groups participate in hydrogen bonding with −NO2 groups of DNCB, which is hanging in the backbone of PU-2.
The abovementioned results indicate that the hanging DNB in the PU
backbone yields extra hydrogen bonding in the PU and will be reflected
in properties.

Synthesis of PI Solution
PMDA (1
g) was taken in a
three-neck round bottom flask and dissolved in 5 mL of distilled N,N-dimethylformamide. After complete dissolution,
6.723 g of JQ-1 was added in the presence of purging nitrogen gas,
which maintains the stoichiometric balance between n(O=C–O–C=O)/n(NCO) =
1/1.2. The reaction mixture was stirred in the presence of a nitrogen
atmosphere until well mixed, and a homogeneous solution was obtained.
The synthetic route and chemical structure of PI are shown in Scheme S1c.

Synthesis of PUI
Different weight ratios of the solution,
0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 of PI/PU-1, were blended, respectively,
which were expressed as PU-1, PUI-1-0.1, PUI-1-0.2, PUI-1-0.3, PUI-1-0.4,
and PUI-1-0.5, and stirred until well mixed in the presence of a nitrogen
atmosphere. Blends were placed in a vacuum oven at room temperature
until the air bubbles disappeared and then poured into polytetrafluoroethylene
molds and cured in an oven at 40 °C for 5 days. After 5 days,
PUI-1 films (sheet) were obtained.

A similar method, as described
above, was followed for the preparation of PUI-2. Different weight
ratios of solution, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 of PI/PU-2, were
blended, respectively, which were expressed as PU-2, PUI-2-0.1, PUI-2-0.2,
PUI-2-0.3, PUI-2-0.4, and PUI-2-0.5. The PUI polymers are demonstrated
in Figure S3. Figure S3a shows that the characteristic peaks of PUI-1 at 1788–1772,
1717–1713, 1378–1374 cm–1 (imided-II),
1120–1118 cm–1 (imided-III), and 726–722
cm–1 (imided-IV) are assigned to axial, transverse,
and out-of-plane vibrations of a cyclic imide structure. Figure S3b shows that the characteristic peaks
of PUI-2 at 1792–1777, 1723–1713, 1375–1370 cm–1 (imided-II), 1120–1117 cm–1 (imided-III), and 726–724 cm–1 (imided-IV)
are assigned similar to PUI-1. Hence, the IR of PUIs attested imide
groups in the samples. The stretching vibration of PUI-1 carbonyl
groups shifted from 1772 to 1788 cm–1 and that of
PUI-2 shifted from 1777 to 1792 cm–1 with increasing
PI content. This is attributed to the fact that dipole–dipole
couplings between hard segments in PUI chains may exist, owing to
the self-assembly of PI. Furthermore, the dipole–dipole interactions
are heightened with increasing PI content.
