Development
of advanced carbon cathode support with the ability
to accommodate high sulfur (S) content as well as effective confinement
of the sulfur species during charge–discharge is of great importance
for sustenance of Li–S battery. A facile poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-assisted
solvothermal method is reported here to prepare Mg–1,4-benzenedicarboxylate
metal organic framework (MOF) from which mesoporous carbon is derived
by thermal treatment, where the hexagonal sheetlike morphology of
the parent MOF is retained. Existence of abundant pores of size 4
and 9 nm extended in three dimensions with zigzag mazelike channels
helps trapping of S in the carbon matrix through capillary effect,
resulting in high S loading. When tested as a cathode for lithium–sulfur
battery, a reversible specific capacity of 1184 mAh g–1 could be achieved at 0.02 C. As evidenced by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, in situ generated Mg in the carbon structure enhances
the conductivity, whereas MgO provides support to S immobilization
through chemical interactions between Mg and sulfur species for surface
polarity compensation, restricting the dissolution of polysulfide
into the electrolyte, the main cause for the “shuttle phenomenon”
and consequent capacity fading. The developed cathode shows good electrochemical
stability with reversible capacities of 602 and 328 mAh g–1 at 0.5 and 1.0 C, respectively, with retentions of 64 and 67% after
200 cycles. The simple MOF-derived strategy adopted here would help
design new carbon materials for Li–S cathode support.

1 Introduction
Li–S
battery is being projected as the most potential successor
to the current Li-ion batteries, offering a theoretical specific capacity
of 1675 mAh g–1 and a high energy density of 2500
Wh kg–1 owing to the reaction of Li and S involving
transfer of 8e– (16Li + S8 ↔ 8Li2S).1 Recent research works on Li–S
technology have led to significant advances; still, development of
Li–S battery is plagued by two major obstacles: (1) intrinsically
low electrical conductivity of S affecting the rate performance forcing
a low active mass loading in the cathode2 and (2) persistent dissolution of sulfide species from cathode into
the electrolyte, leading to a “shuttle phenomenon”,
thereby reducing the Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability.3 To overcome these obstacles, rational design
of the cathode structure is required. In this respect, the importance
of morphological architecture of the cathode support cannot be undermined.
Carbon is the most widely used cathode support to host sulfur. One
effective approach could be confining the sulfur species with advanced
permanent porous structure of carbon derived from metal organic framework
(MOF). MOF is a well-ordered framework constructed from the bonding
between metal ions and polyfunctional organic ligands, resulting in
a crystalline porous material with high surface area and tunable porosity.4 MOFs are widely applied in heterogeneous catalysis,5 gas storage and separation,6 and drug delivery7 for their
ability to confine different substances, such as small molecules,8 dyes,9 drugs,10 and metal nanoparticles.11 MOF, by itself, can act as cathode support by confining
S inside the pores as demonstrated by Tarascon et al.12 with a mesoporous MIL-100 (Cr) MOF. However, due to their
poor electronic and ionic conductivities and low electrochemical stability,
the electrochemical performance of MOF/S cathodes13 are still not comparable to carbon/S cathodes.14−16 On the other hand, carbon derived from MOF could have the dual qualities
of higher degree of S confinement and good electrical conductivity.
Realizing this, recently, considerable research attention has been
directed to fully explore the promises of carbon materials derived
from MOF hosts for achieving superior battery performance.17 MOFs have much more variable pore structures
than other types of porous materials. Also, the pore and cage sizes
and window apertures can be systematically tuned by varying different
metal ions and ligands for confinement of sulfur. For example, it
is found that cagelike pores can confine sulfur more efficiently than
straight channels.18,19 Moreover, the pore surfaces can
be directly functionalized for further stronger interactions with
sulfur. Also, it is possible that, even after carbonizing under high
temperature, MOF-derived carbon could retain the morphology and porous
structure of the parent MOF.20 In addition
to this, the metallic ions might be reduced to corresponding metal
or metallic oxides that can act as “localized” inner
templates to form mesopores21 and simultaneously
may enhance the electrical conductivity. Moreover, additional macropores
could be formed during carbonization due to the synergic effect of
organic material decomposition and gas activation, which would facilitate
electrolyte access for transportation of ions. Therefore, to achieve
high-performance carbon cathodes, the pore structures and properties
of the parent MOFs need to be fully exploited. However, there are
only a handful of reports available on MOF-derived carbon for Li–S
battery application.17,22−27

Wu et al.22 first reported the
use of
MOF-derived carbon for Li–S battery using zeolitic imidazolate
framework (ZIF) material, ZIF-8 [Zn(MeIM)2; MeIM = 2-methylimidazole],
as the MOF precursor. Microporous carbon polyhedrons (MPCPs) obtained
by carbonization in an inert gas at 1000 °C showed reversible
capacity of about 420 mAh g–1 at current density
of 100 mA g–1, though with a low S loading of 43
wt %. Since then, several MOF-derived carbons have been studied mostly
using ZIF as precursor. Li et al.23 prepared
tunable porous structure of carbon from ZIF-8, which delivered a high
initial discharge capacity of ∼1500 mAh g–1; however, it reduced to ∼800 mAh g–1 after
100 cycles. Xi et al.17 used four sacrificial
MOFs for the preparation of carbon: ZIF-8, MOF-519 (RT-MOF-5), solvothermally
synthesized MOF-520 (solvo-MOF-5), and [Zn3(fumarate)3(dmf)2] (Zn-fumarate). By melt–diffusion
process, 55 wt % of sulfur could be encapsulated to the pyrolyzed
carbon. Among these, carbon derived from Zn-fumarate MOF showed the
best performance with an initial discharge capacity of 1471.8 mAh
g–1, which decayed quickly to 662.3 mAh g–1 after 40 cycles. Li et al.24 developed
nitrogen-doped carbon (NDC) spheres with abundant mesopores (22 nm)
and micropores (0.5 nm) by carbonization of ZIF-8 MOF but could achieve
sulfur loading of only 37%. The NDC–sulfur hybrid cathode exhibited
a reversible capacity of 936.5 mAh g –1 at a current
density of 335 mA g–1. Bao et al.25 designed a hierarchical architecture of multiwalled carbon
nanotube@mesoporous carbon (MWCNT@Meso-C) using MWCNT@MOF-5, in which
58 wt % of S could be loaded by melt–diffusion method. The
MWCNT@Meso-C/S sulfur cathode showed a high initial capacity of 1343
mAh g–1, which gradually faded to 540 mAh g–1 after 50 cycles at 0.5 C. Yang et al.26 synthesized French fry-like hierarchical porous
carbon (FLHPC) with a one-dimensional structure from aluminum metal
organic framework and achieved a relatively high S loading of 57 wt
%. The S/FLHPC cathode showed a high initial discharge capacity of
∼1200 mA h g–1 at 0.1 C with a capacity retention
of 68% at 0.5 C after 200 cycles. For improving the electrical conductivity,
Li et al.27 synthesized reduced graphene
oxide (RGO)-wrapped cobalt-doped porous carbon polyhedron from ZIF-67
metal organic framework. The RGO–C–Co could accommodate
∼59 wt % of S and showed stable performance with a specific
capacity of 949 mAh g–1 at the 300th cycle at a
current density of 300 mA g–1.

Motivated by
these inspirational works, we have synthesized magnesium
1,4-benzenedicarboxylate MOF by a simple solvothermal method using
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) as a structure-directing agent as well
as a precursor for preparing porous carbon with in situ embedment
of Mg/MgO. Most of the MOFs used for deriving carbon are based on
transition-metal ions, particularly Zn. Moving to a lighter metal,
Mg would provide several advantages, such as low carbonization temperature.
Also, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (1,4-BDC) is known to be a good
organic connector to metal ions. The rigidity of its rodlike unit
allows controlled growth of network structures.28 Additionally, the conjugated carboxylate groups with an
aromatic core having strong π–π interaction can
easily bond with metal ions forming thermodynamically driven highly
ordered stable MOF structures.29−31 However, compared to that on
transition-metal–BDC MOFs, very little work is available on
Mg-based MOF in general32−34 and Mg–BDC MOF in particular.28,35,36 MOFs intrinsically contain a
large number of void spaces; also, there is poor orbital overlap with
the metal ions due to the insulating nature of the organic ligands.
As a result, the electrical conductivity of MOFs is generally low.37,38 Carbonization at high temperatures would render the derived carbon
still more porous due to escape of gas molecules. On the other hand,
if some of the void spaces are filled with metal/metal oxide, there
might be significant improvement in conductivity. Further, the embedded
metal/metal oxide might help immobilization of S and also act as a
catalyst for redox reaction between Li and S. With this aim, for the
first time, we report the preparation and electrochemical properties
of Mg/MgO-embedded carbon as Li–S battery cathode support derived
from Mg–1,4-BDC MOF. We show that the simple strategy adopted
here results in a better S confinement inside the cathode structure
and a steady cycling behavior possibly due to suppression of S dissolution
into the electrolyte and reduced polysulfide shuttle phenomenon.

2 Results and Discussion
To check the formation of Mg–1,4-BDC
MOF, powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) studies were carried out. Both the MOFs, synthesized with and
without addition of PVP, exhibit sharp diffraction peaks, indicating
a well-defined crystal structure (Figure 1a). The peak positions match well with the
previously reported data for Mg–1,4-BDC MOF, indicating successful
synthesis of the MOFs.28 Noticeably, increase
in sharpness and intensity of the peaks for PMg–1,4-BDC MOF
suggests oriented growth, induced by PVP. Figure 1b shows the diffractograms for carbon derived
from Mg–1,4-BDC MOF and PMg–1,4-BDC MOF. A broad hump
at 2θ ∼ 26° indicates the presence of carbon, predominantly
amorphous in nature. Additionally, five sharp peaks are observed at
2θ values of 36.88, 42.87, 62.24, 74.61, and 78.56°, all
of which could be indexed to the cubic phase of MgO (JCPDS File No.
01-078-0430). Heat treatment of the parent MOFs at 800 °C in
argon atmosphere generates carbon in situ from the organic moiety.
Most of the Mg is evaporated because of having the lowest melting
point (650 °C) among the alkaline earth metals, whereas a part
is converted to MgO by reacting with the oxygen of the carboxylic
group. However, the presence of any residual trace amount of Mg could
not be confirmed as the strongest (011) peak for Mg is obscured by
the (111) peak for MgO. No other impurity phase could be discerned.
Therefore, the XRD results indicate successful synthesis of in situ
MgO-incorporated MOF-derived carbon.

It is known that the carboxylate
functional groups present in the
organic ligand (benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate) can act as the nucleation
sites for the MOF crystal growth.30,39 Here, PVP
plays a crucial role during the solvothermal synthesis process as
a structure-directing agent by regulating the growth and assembly
of the unit structures and also acts as a stabilizing agent during
the metal–ligand coordination.40,41 The effect
of PVP on the morphology is clearly manifested in the field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the synthesized MOFs
(Figure 2). It is observed
that the morphology of Mg–1,4-BDC MOF consists of small platelike
particles assembled in a random fashion (Figure 2a), whereas large thick plates in orderly
fashion are observed for PMg–1,4-BDC MOF (Figure 2c). Further, it is observed
that in C@PMg–1,4-BDC (Figure 2d) the morphology of the parent MOF (PMg–1,4-BDC
MOF) is transferred to the derived carbon, whereas in case of C@Mg–1,4-BDC
(Figure 2b), irregular
morphology consisting of thin sheets and particles is observed. However,
due to the carbonization process, the surface of C@PMg–1,4-BDC
becomes much rougher than the parent MOF. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of C@PMg–1,4-BDC, shown in Figure 3, reveal a spongelike morphology with the
presence of abundant pores extended in three dimensions forming zigzag
channels resembling a maze. Large void spaces in such kind of spongelike
carbon matrix will provide mechanical support to accommodate the strain
induced by volume changes associated with the reaction of S with Li.
Observation of diffused rings in the selected area diffraction (SAD)
pattern (inset of Figure 3b) indicates the predominantly amorphous nature of the MOF-derived
carbon. From Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements,
a high surface area of 261.4 m2 g–1 is
obtained for C@PMg–1,4-BDC. The adsorption–desorption
isotherms show a typical type IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop indicating
the presence of mesoporous structures (Figure 4) and extending up to P/P0 ∼ 1.0. This distinct hysteresis loop
appears before P/P0 =
0.8 starting from P/P0 = 0.45 (H1 type) and also at P/P0 ∼ 0.8–1.0 (H3 type), suggesting the existence
of interconnected slit-type pores (originated from the pores of parent
MOF) along with interparticle pores. In the pore size distribution
plot, a bimodal distribution centered at ∼4 and ∼9 nm
is found (inset of Figure 4) with a pore volume of 0.29 cc g–1. Further,
the narrow widths of pore size distribution peaks indicate uniformity
of the mesoporous structures. The presence of abundant hierarchical
pores and three-dimensionally connected zigzag mazelike channels would
be beneficial for both electrolyte accessibility and retention of
polysulfides within the carbon matrix. On the other hand, C@PMg–1,4-BDC
shows a BET surface area of 310 m2 g–1 and existence of larger pores of size ∼15 nm with a broad
distribution in higher pore size range (macro region) with a pore
volume of 0.77 cc g–1 (Figure S1, Supporting Information).

Raman spectral studies of the composites were undertaken
for chemical
characterization as well as for obtaining the structural information
of the MOF-derived carbon. The presence of characteristic bands for
graphitic carbon material can be observed from the Raman spectra of
both the samples, C@Mg–1,4-BDC and C@PMg–1,4-BDC (Figure 5). The Raman active
bands at ∼1348 (D band) and ∼1598 cm–1 (G band) with ID/IG > 1 revealed the formation of functionalized graphitic
carbon
with structural defects/disorder.42−44 It is well known that
D and G bands originated from the sp2 graphitic carbon
layer and defects are generated due to the formation sp3 carbon within the lattice. The presence of a large number of structural
defects (ID/IG > 1) would be beneficial to accommodate larger quantity of S
by
building a stronger interaction between carbon and sulfur, thereby
strengthening the immobilization ability. Moreover, the presence of
overtones of D band at ∼2900 cm–1 also suggests
the formation of graphitic carbon material after heat treatment of
the MOFs under inert atmosphere.44 In addition
to that, the broad low-intense peaks observed within the ranges of
approximately 700–800 and 250–320 cm–1 can be assigned to the vibrational bands for Mg-O and Mg-OH, respectively.45

Surface chemical states of the
elements are characterized by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of C@PMg–1,4-BDC.
The surface survey scan shows the presence of C 1s along with O 1s
and Mg 2p (Figure S2, Supporting Information).
Deconvolution of high-resolution C 1s spectra (Figure 6a) indicates the presence of several surface
functional groups.46,47 The peaks at 284.45 and 284.82
eV correspond to the skeletal C=C and C–C of graphitic
carbon material, respectively, and the corresponding π–π*
binding energy is observed at 290.90 eV.42,46,48 High-resolution XPS images of O 1s (Figure 6b) reveal the presence
of MgO and Mg(OH)2 as the main chemical states of oxygen-containing
Mg moieties. Interestingly, the presence of mixed hydrated forms of
Mg along with metallic Mg is confirmed from the deconvoluted Mg 2p
spectra (Figure 6c).48,49 Notably, the presence of a minute amount of metallic Mg would significantly
increase the electrical conductivity of the carbon host, thus facilitating
the charge transfer during the redox processes.

C@Mg–1,4-BDC/S and C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S cathodes
have
been prepared by infiltrating sulfur into the respective MOF-derived
carbon by CS2 route. The X-ray diffractogram of C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S
(Figure S3, Supporting Information) is
in conformation to JCPDS File No. 01-083-2283 and indicates the presence
of sulfur predominantly in S8 form. The sulfur content
in the respective MOF-derived C/S composites has been determined by
the weight losses of C@Mg–1,4-BDC/S and C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in air (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Both the composites exhibit nearly
identical TGA profiles from which a high degree of sulfur loading
of 69.1 wt % could be determined. The relative composition of the
composites is estimated to be S 69.1 wt % (62.7 mol %), C 8.9 wt %
(21.5 mol %), and MgO 22.0 wt % (15.8 mol %). Electrochemical performances
of carbon host materials are usually compromised by low sulfur loading
ability, typically in the range of 40–60 wt %,50−52 which greatly reduces the overall energy density of Li–S
cells. In the present case, such high S loading might have resulted
from the hierarchical mesoporous structure of carbon with bimodal
pore size producing a capillary effect, the presence of MgO with surface
affinity toward electronegative S, and a large number of structural
defects, which would promote a stronger interaction between carbon
and sulfur, thereby strengthening the immobilization ability. Energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectrum and elemental distribution map of C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S
(Figures S5 and S6, Supporting Information)
indicate a homogeneous distribution of C, O, Mg, and S in the composite
cathode.

The electrochemical properties of the developed C@Mg–1,4-BDC/S
and C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S cathodes were first examined by cyclic
voltammetry (CV) in the potential window of 1.5–3.0 V (Figure 7a,b). Two well-defined
cathodic peaks at ∼2.36 and ∼2.06 V in the cyclic voltammograms
are observed due to multistep reduction of sulfur53 and could be assigned in the following way: the broad reduction
peak at around 2.36 V corresponds to the redox reaction of elemental
S8 ring and the formation of polysulfides (S82–), whereas the peak at ∼2.06 V reflects
the deep redox reaction from higher polysulfide species (Li2Sn, 4 < n < 8)
to the lower polysulfide species (Li2Sn, n ≤ 2). During the first anodic
scan, two typical oxidation peaks were observed, at ∼2.43 and
∼2.55 V, where the insoluble Li2S changed into polysulfides
and eventually to elemental S8 form. During the subsequent
scans, it was found that the cathodic peaks and the first anodic peak
shift only marginally, but the higher oxidation peak in the anodic
scan shifts ∼0.15 V to the higher potential side (at ∼2.7
V). Such shifting of peak position could be assigned to the so-called
electrode activation process, that is, rearrangement of orthogonal
sulfur from the original site to a more stable site.53−55 The peak positions in the subsequent cycles remain nearly unchanged,
implying good reversibility.56,57

cyclic voltammograms for (a) C@Mg–1,4-BDC/S
and (b) C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S in the potential window of 1.5–3.0
V at a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s–1.

The initial galvanostatic charge–discharge
behaviors of
C@Mg–1,4-BDC/S and C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S cathodes were evaluated
at a current rate of 0.02 C (1 C = 1675 mA g–1)
in the potential window of 1.5–2.8 V versus Li+/Li
(Figure 8a,b). Two
flat discharge plateaus located at 2.36 and 2.06 V were clearly observed,
which are in good agreement with the CV results. The initial discharge/charge
capacities of 1041/1009 and 1201/1184 mAh g–1 were
obtained for C@Mg–1,4-BDC/S and C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S, respectively,
with corresponding very high first-cycle Coulombic efficiencies of
96.9 and 98.6%.

and (b) C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S

Cycling performances of C@Mg–1,4-BDC/S and C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S
composite were compared at a current rate of 0.2 C (Figure 9). C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S shows
a capacity of 935 mAh g–1 at the first cycle, which
reduces to 757 mAh g–1 (81% retention) after 100
cycles and to 621 mAh g–1 after 200 cycles (66.4%
retention). It is possible that LiNO3 additive in the electrolyte
could decompose at potentials <1.6 V, but no definite signature
was observed in cyclic voltammogram. Also, galvanostatic charge–discharge
(GCD) profiles at different cycling intervals indicate a small plateau
only at the first cycle, which is not observed in subsequent cycles
(Figure S7, Supporting Information). Moreover,
because the reduction products, if any, formed at potentials >1.5
V are soluble in the electrolyte, they do not significantly affect
the cycling and capacity retention as observed by others.58 Despite having a high S loading of 69.1 wt %,
the observed capacity values for C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S are comparable
to or higher than those MOF-derived carbon materials (a detailed performance
comparison of different carbon materials derived from MOF (C@MOF)
is given in Table S1, Supporting Information).17,21−27,50,51,59 On the other hand, C@Mg–1,4-BDC/S
shows a relatively lower capacity of 791 mAh g–1 at the first cycle at the same current rate and retains only 56.6%
of capacity (448 mAh g–1) after 100 cycles (Figure 9). These results
demonstrate that the morphological advantages in C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S
resulted in a greater capacity. It is believed that the abundant channelized
mesopores with narrow sizes (4 and 9 nm) facilitate easy access to
as well as diffusion of electrolyte and concurrently immobilize S
by cohesive force due to capillary effect. Also, the mazelike zigzag
channels would be more effective for confinement of polysulfides than
straight channels.18,19 To see the effect of Mg/MgO embedded
in the carbon matrix, a control sample was prepared by removing Mg/MgO
from C@Mg–1,4-BDC by acid treatment. Cycling data of the control
sample C@1,4-BDC/S at 0.2 C rate show much inferior performance (392
mAh g–1, 46% retention after 100 cycles) to either
C@Mg–1,4-BDC/S or C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S, confirming the positive
effect of Mg/MgO. It is probable that the presence of Mg would enhance
the charge transport, whereas the presence of MgO might help in the
confinement of S species within the cathode structure through strong
interaction with S for surface polarity compensation. This is quite
likely for materials with a high affinity toward electronegative atoms,
such as MgO, where even nonpolar termination may readily develop ad-layer.60,61

and C@Mg–1,4-BDC/S at 0.2 C and C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S at 0.2,
0.5, and 1 C.

To explain the superior
cycling performance of C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S,
a detailed XPS analysis was carried out to verify whether any interaction
present between Mg and S in this sample. The surface survey scan shows
the presence of S 2p binding energy peak along with C 1s, O 1s, and
Mg 2p (Figure S8, Supporting Information).
Further, deconvolution of high-resolution S 2p and Mg 2p binding energy
peaks was carried out to understand the interaction between these
elements. In high-resolution S 2p XPS images (Figure 10a), S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 doublet appears at binding energy values of 163.89 and 165.15 eV
corresponding to the C–S and C=S bonds that subsequently
reveal the incorporation of sulfur into the graphitic carbonaceous
framework.61 Other peaks in the higher
binding energy region of 167–174 eV can be assigned to the
oxidized forms of sulfur.62−64 Deconvolution of high-resolution
Mg 2p spectrum also gives some interesting observations. The binding
energy peaks related to the oxygen-containing Mg moieties (Figure 10b) get shifted
toward higher-energy region compared to those observed for C@PMg–1,4-BDC
(Figure 6c). Additionally,
the relative intensity of the peak corresponding to the free metallic
Mg (49.90 eV) gets reduced and simultaneously a new peak has developed
at 51.01 eV, which corresponds to the metallic Mg engaged in the interaction
with sulfur.65 Thus, XPS study clearly
indicates the presence of chemical interactions between Mg and the
sulfur component present in the hybrid system. Thereby, the dissolution
of polysulfide into the electrolyte, which is the main cause for the
“shuttle phenomenon” and the consequent capacity fading,
is restricted to a great extent.65,66 Further, to
check the rate capability and electrochemical stability, cycling of
C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S composite was carried out at current rates
of 0.5 and 1 C for 200 cycles (Figure 9). Reversible capacities of 386 and 220 mAh g–1 were obtained at 0.5 and 1.0 C, respectively, with retentions of
65 and 67% after 200 cycles. Also, the Coulombic efficiency (at 1
C rate) is found to be quite high (∼98%) even at the 200th
cycle (Figure 9). Therefore,
the developed C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S cathode shows good cycling stability.
To investigate any morphological changes upon cycling, ex situ FESEM
study was undertaken on the C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S electrode after
100 cycles at 0.2 C rate. It is observed that even after prolonged
cycling the general sheetlike morphology of C@PMg–1,4-BDC is
preserved, although the sheets appear somewhat fluffy due to infiltrated
S within the carbon matrix (Figure S9,
Supporting Information).

and (b) Mg 2p.

Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) provides useful insight
into the degradation mechanism of the cell. A systematic study was
undertaken by recording the impedance spectra of C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S
at different cycling intervals at 0.2 C rate, and the Nyquist plots
are shown in Figure 11. The as-assembled cell shows a low solution resistance (Rs) of 2.3 Ω. Upon cycling, the increase
in Rs is only marginal with values of
3.2, 3.7, and 4.2 Ω after the 1st, 50th, and 100th cycles, respectively.
This indicates that S is confined to the cathode structure with no
significant dissolution into the electrolyte. The charge-transfer
resistance (Rct) of the as-assembled cell
is found to be 92 Ω. The Rct gradually
decreases with cycling up to about 50 cycles and thereafter remains
constant with a value of about 20 Ω. The decrease in Rct can be attributed to the gradual wetting
of the electrodes and activation of the pores.67 This also explains a slight increase and then decrease
of capacity for about 50 cycles during the cycling test.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we report the preparation and electrochemical properties
of Mg/MgO-embedded carbon as Li–S battery cathode support derived
from Mg–1,4-BDC MOF. The derived carbon mimics the hexagonal
sheetlike morphology of the parent MOF having a high surface area
of 310 m2 g–1. The MOF-derived carbon
contains abundant mesopores with bimodal pore size distributions of
∼4 and ∼9 nm, which are channelized in three dimensions
in a zigzag way resembling a maze. The presence of structural defects/disorder
and mazelike pores helps immobilization of sulfur within the cathode
structure through capillary forces. Additionally, it is found that
embedded MgO further supports confinement of sulfur species through
chemical interactions between Mg and sulfur, limiting the polysulfide
shuttle phenomenon during redox reactions, whereas metallic Mg enhances
the electrical conductivity. High sulfur loading (69.1 wt %), good
reversible capacity (1184 mAh g–1), and electrochemical
cycling stability have been achieved, highlighting the efficacy of
the presently designed cathode support for efficient confinement of
polysulfides.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Material Synthesis
4.1.1 Synthesis of Mg–1,4-BDC
MOF and PVP-Assisted
Mg–1,4-BDC MOF
In a typical procedure for the synthesis
of PVP-assisted Mg–1,4-BDC MOF, 0.33 g (2 mmol) of benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic
acid (BDC) (98%; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 20 mL of dimethylformamide
(DMF) (≥99%; Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.32 g of PVP (MW 58 000;
Alfa Aesar) was added to the BDC solution. A separate solution was
prepared by dissolving 0.6 g (4 mmol) of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (99%; Sigma-Aldrich) in 20 mL of DMF. The two
solutions were mixed dropwise under stirring condition and kept for
5 min. The resulting mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon
autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room
temperature, the yellowish powder was washed repeatedly with ethanol
to wash out residual PVP and dried. The synthesized MOF powder was
named as PMg–1,4-BDC MOF.

For preparation of Mg–1,4-BDC
MOF without PVP assistance, the same procedure was followed except
for the addition of PVP into the precursor BDC solution. This sample
was named as Mg–1,4-BDC MOF.

4.1.2 Synthesis
of MOF-Derived Carbon (C@Mg–1,4-BDC,
C@PMg–1,4-BDC, and C@1,4-BDC)
Mg–1,4-BDC MOF
was put into a ceramic boat and heated at 800 °C for 3 h in an
Ar-filled tubular furnace at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1. The resulting black flocculent powder was labeled as C@Mg–1,4-BDC.

In similar way, PMg–1,4-BDC MOF was carbonized to obtain
C@PMg–1,4-BDC.

For comparison purpose, embedded Mg/MgO
is removed from the carbon
structure by etching C@Mg–1,4-BDC using hydrofluoric acid (≥99.99%;
Sigma-Aldrich). The sample is named as C@1,4-BDC.

4.1.3 Synthesis of MOF-Derived Carbon/S Composites
(C@Mg–1,4-BDC/S, C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S, and C@1,4-BDC/S)
C@Mg–1,4-BDC (0.2 g) and commercial sulfur (0.6 g, ≥99.5%;
Sigma-Aldrich) were dispersed into 6 mL of CS2. The mixture
was stirred at room temperature until the solvent was evaporated completely.
It was then subjected to heat treatment in Ar atmosphere in two steps:
at 155 °C for 12 h, followed by 200 °C for 2 h. The obtained
powder was named as C@Mg–1,4-BDC/S. In similar way, C@PMg–1,4-BDC/S
and C@1,4-BDC/S were prepared from C@PMg–1,4-BDC and C@1,4-BDC,
respectively.

4.2 Material Characterization
To examine
the formation of MOFs and phase purity of the derived carbon, X-ray
powder diffraction studies were carried out. X-ray diffractograms
were recorded in the 2θ range of 5–70° at a scanning
rate of 2° min–1 by a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray
diffractometer operating at 9 kW (200 mA; 45 kV) using Cu Kα
radiation. Microstructure and morphology of the MOFs and the derived
carbon were examined by a field emission scanning electron microscope
(Zeiss Supra 35, Germany). Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the
powder samples were carried out under argon flow in the temperature
range of 27–800 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 using simultaneous thermal analyzer (STA 449F; Netzsch,
Germany). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area
measurements were carried out by N2 gas adsorption at 77.3
K using a Quantachrome Autosorb surface analyzer. Pore size distribution
was calculated from the sorption isotherm by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method. Raman signals were obtained from powder samples using a Renishaw
InVia micro-Raman spectrometer with excitation of argon-ion (514 nm)
lasers with a resolution of 1 cm–1. The laser power
was kept sufficiently low to avoid local heating of the sample. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of MOF-derived carbon
were done on a PHI 5000 VersaProbe II XPS system with Al Kα
source and a charge neutralizer at room temperature, maintaining a
base pressure of about 6 × 10–10 mbar and energy
resolution of 0.6 eV.

4.3 Electrochemical Characterization
4.3.1 Cathode Preparation
MOF-derived
C/S composite cathodes were fabricated by the standard slurry casting
method. The slurry was made by intimately mixing the prepared MOF-derived
C/S composite, Super-P (conducting agent), and poly(vinylidene fluoride)
(binder) in a weight ratio of 80:10:10 in n-methyl
pyrrolidinone as solvent. The slurry was coated onto Al foil (thickness,
19 μm) and dried at 60 °C under vacuum overnight. After
calendaring and roll pressing of the resulting film, circular disks
of diameter 15 mm were cut and used as electrode. The active mass
loading was typically ∼2 mg cm–2.

4.3.2 Cell Fabrication
The electrochemical
properties were evaluated by fabricating 2032-type coin cells in an
argon-filled glovebox (M′BRAUN, Germany), where the moisture
and oxygen levels were kept at <0.5 ppm. Li metal was used as the
counter electrode as well as the reference electrode, Celgard 2300
was used as the separator, and the electrolyte was 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide
(LiTFSI, ≥98%; Alfa Aesar) and 0.1 M lithium nitrate (LiNO3, ≥99%; Acros Organics) dissolved in a mixture of 1,3-dioxolane
(99.8%; Acros Organics) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (≥99%; Acros
Organics) (1:1 vol %).

4.3.3 Electrochemical Measurements
Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) was carried out in the potential window of 1.5–3.0
V using a galvanostat–potentiostat (PGSTAT302N; Autolab, the
Netherlands). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments
were also performed using the same galvanostat–potentiostat
in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. Galvanostatic charge–discharge
measurements were carried out in the potential window of 1.5–2.8
V using an automatic battery tester (BT2000; Arbin).
