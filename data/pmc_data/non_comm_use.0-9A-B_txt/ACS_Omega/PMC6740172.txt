Tribological
studies of the 2D nanoadditives such as MoS2 and graphene
are mostly performed in base oils such as SN500, SN150,
or paraffin. We have focused on their effect in lubrication properties
of industrial oils (e.g., axle, transmission, and compressor oils)
along with SN500 oil employing a four-ball tester. Two types of graphene
powders (GpowA with fewer defects than GpowC), MoS2 powder,
and their physical mixtures are chosen as nanoadditives. The tribology
performance for 0.05 wt% of additives in various industrial oils is
evaluated by monitoring the coefficient of friction (COF) during rubbing
and wear scar diameter (WSD) of the steel balls after rubbing. Elemental
analysis and electron microscopy have been performed on the wear surfaces
for evidence of any tribofilm formation. GpowA favors antifriction
for axle and transmission oils with 40% reduction in axle oil, whereas
it improved antiwear properties in most of the oils. GpowC shows a
COF decrement by 12% only for compressor oil, but contribute to wear
reduction in all oils. The observed COF reduction is attributed to
the compatibility of nonfunctionalized GpowA with nonpolar axle oil
and functionalized GpowC with polar compressor oil. MoS2 shows a decrease in the COF and WSD in most industrial oils; the
best being 60% COF and 7% WSD reduction in axle oil. For additives
in oils that favor antiwear, flakes or particles are observed on the
wear surface supported by the higher elemental contribution of the
constituents from the wear region. The mixtures of GpowA or C with
MoS2, however, does not seem to favor improvement in the
COF or WSD in industrial oils. With assistance from oleylamine surfactants,
the lubrication properties of most additives are improved, particularly
for the mixtures with 12–15% COF reduction and 4–7%
WSD reduction in compressor oil. The study indicates that a large
sheet size of high-quality graphene aids antifriction and addition
of surfactant molecules facilitates a co-operative effect between
MoS2 and graphene for improved tribology.

1 Introduction
In
the manufacturing world, productivity translates to smooth and
durable functioning of machine parts for long periods of time thereby
minimizing downtime needed for maintenance. Friction and wear are
the primary reasons for the loss of energy and material in the machinery
parts. The emergence of nanotechnology has influenced all disciplines
of science1,2 and tribology is no exception.3 It has been well reported that the addition of
nanoparticles has significantly altered the mechanical properties
of lubricant oils.3,4 Several mechanisms such as third-body
effect, rolling/sliding mechanism, and protective film have been proposed
to explain the improvement in properties upon the addition of the
nanomaterials.5,6 The properties of the lubricant
can be modified by changing the concentration, shape, size, and crystallinity
of these nanoparticles.3,7

Graphene, world’s
first 2D material, has been a treasure
trove for researchers8 for exploring its
novel electronic, mechanical, and chemical properties. Recently, transition
metal chalcogenides such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2),
molybdenum diselenide, and tungsten sulfide have been included in
the 2D family of the new nanomaterials. The most widely researched
materials for lubrication purposes are 2D materials such as graphene,9,10 analogs of graphene, and transition metal dichalcogenides such as
MoS2.11 Graphene and MoS2 have been extensively studied for their tribological properties,
both in solid state12−15 and as additives in fluid lubricants.16−18 Both 2D nanomaterials,
either as individual additives or physical and chemical mixtures,
have been shown to improve lubrication or tribological properties.19−21 In most cases, stable dispersions of nanoadditives in various hydrocarbon
oils are obtained by employing suitable surfactants.22 Because the presence of molecular surfactants can cause
degradation under extreme tribological conditions, there have been
efforts to prepare self-dispersible ultrafine additives.23 The tribological properties of graphene, graphene
oxide, and their composites have been largely studied in typical base
oils such as paraffin, SN150, and SN500. Bai et al. have investigated
the tribological behavior of graphene decorated with ceria particles
in paraffin base oil and reported that the addition of 0.06 wt% nanoadditives
in the base oil decreased the friction coefficient from 0.21 to 0.1
and the wear rate to 1.5% than those in the base oil.7 Rajendhran et al. have studied the lubricating properties
of the Ni-promoted MoS2 nanosheets in SN500 mineral oil
and observed that 0.5 wt% nanoadditives in base oil improved the antiwear
property by 40–50% and antifriction property by 15–20%
compared to base oil.16 The tribological
properties of the reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/MoS2 heterostructures
in paraffin oil were explored by Hou et al. and the nanoadditive showed
friction coefficient as low as 0.09 and also improved wear resistance
compared to the base oil.24 Wu et al. analyzed
the tribological properties of MoS2 on graphene as a lubricant
additive in perfluoropolyether base oil wherein they observed that
by addition of 1 wt% of an additive, the friction coefficient decreased
to 0.06 and the wear rate reduced by 91%.25

Although the tribological properties of graphene and MoS2 dispersions have been studied in base oils (such as paraffin,
SN150,
and SN500), their application in the industry remains restricted because
of the limited knowledge of their properties in industrially available
oils. In the present study, we examine the tribological properties
of various types of industrial lubricating oils doped with two types
of graphene powders (e.g., nonfunctionalized—GpowA and functionalized—GpowC),
MoS2, and their physical mixtures.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Morphology and Structure
Raman spectroscopy
was employed to study and validate the structure of the nanoadditives.
The two types of graphene additives, GpowA and GpowC, were obtained
commercially, whereas MoS2 was obtained via hydrothermal
synthesis in the laboratory. The details are given in the Experimental Section. Figure 1 depicts the Raman spectra of GpowA, GpowC,
and MoS2 powders acquired at 532 nm excitation. For GpowA,
the two most intense features are a peak at 1580 cm–1 corresponding to the G band and another peak at ∼2716 cm–1 assigned as the 2D band.26 For GpowC, an intense band is observed at 1340 cm–1 corresponding to the D band along with the G band at 1597 cm–1, and a weak 2D band at around 2885 cm–1 is observed. The D band arises due to defects indicative of disordered
graphene systems.27 The 2D band is the
first overtone of the D peak, which is very sensitive to defects arising
from the functional groups or microstructural reasons such as lattice
vacancy and edge states. The negligible D band intensity and a sharp
2D band in the case of GpowA indicate a very ordered graphene layer
similar to graphite lattice.27 However,
the weak intensity and broad shape of a 2D band reveals the presence
of a multilayer in GpowA. GpowC exhibits a broad and intense D-band
indicative of functionalized graphene with more edge states. The observed
2D band is weak and very broad, which shows the presence of exfoliated
layers of defect-rich functionalized graphene similar to the case
of rGO, usually obtained by chemical reduction.28,29 The calculated ID/IG ratio of GpowC from Figure 1 is 0.74, which is higher than that of GpowA
(ID/IG is
0.20), confirming high density of defects in GpowC.30,31 To further investigate the presence of functional groups in GpowA
and GpowC samples, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
was conducted (Figure S1). The GpowC spectra
show bands at 3500 and 1160 cm–1 corresponding to
−OH and C–O vibrational modes supporting the presence
of functional groups on GpowC. The GpowA spectra show bands due to
C=C and C–H vibrations and remain mostly featureless,
resembling the spectrum for nonfunctionalized pristine graphene.32

Figure 1 Raman spectra of the various nanoadditives in a powder
form acquired
at 532 nm excitation.

In the case of MoS2 powder, the signature peaks corresponding
to the in-plane (E2g1) and out-of-plane (A1g) vibrational modes of MoS2 are observed at 380 and 405 cm–1, respectively,
in the Raman spectra (Figure 1).33 The spacing between the two
Raman peaks is 25 cm–1, indicating that the MoS2 consists of more than 10 layers. The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of MoS2, GpowA, and GpowC are displayed in Figure S2 and further complement the inferences
from Raman spectra. GpowA shows a sharp intense peak at 26.5°
corresponding to (002) of graphite (PCPDF card no. 89-7213) indicating
graphitic nature of the material, whereas GpowC exhibits a broad peak
at 25.2° similar to that reported for rGO.28 For MoS2, the peaks at 29.2°, 33.6°,
and 56.1° could be indexed to the (004), (101), and (106) planes
of hexagonal MoS2 (PCPDF card no. 87-2416). The peaks at
16.5° and 20.4° can be associated with the presence of unreacted
sulfur (PCPDF card no. 78-0793). Raman spectra of the prepared mixtures
of graphene and MoS2 are also given in Figure 1. For characterization purpose,
the mixtures were prepared by physically mixing 0.03 wt% of GpowA
or C with 0.02 wt% of MoS2 in isopropyl alcohol and subjected
to sonication. The powders were further dried and used for Raman,
XRD, and electron microscope studies. Raman spectra of mixtures show
the bands due to the presence of both the components, GpowA/C and
MoS2; however, with no pronounced Raman shift. This indicates
that there is no chemical interaction between graphene and MoS2 in the additive mixtures, but rather a physical mixing is
prevalent.

Figure 2a–c
show the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images
of the additives, GpowA, GpowC, and MoS2. From the FESEM,
GpowA is shown to have exfoliated graphene sheets with large flake
sizes (>10 μm). GpowC consists of aggregated sheets with
smaller
flake sizes (1–2 μm), however, few particles with larger
sizes are also observed. Particle size of the as-prepared graphene
powders was also analyzed after 5 min sonication of corresponding
graphene in isopropyl alcohol using light scattering technique. The
results demonstrate that the average particle size of GpowA after
shearing is below 30 μm and that of GpowC is 5 μm. FESEM
of the synthesized MoS2 powder shows that it contains MoS2 curls aggregated to form sheets and spherical nanoparticles
of size 400–700 nm (Figure 2c). The nanosheet morphology of the synthesized MoS2 powder is more obvious from transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images which will be discussed later. The average sheet size
of MoS2 powder is 3–4 μm, and the wrinkled
features that are composed of nanosheets are typically 20 nm thick.
The thickness and size of the flakes were estimated from TEM and FESEM
images.

MoS2 powder.

The FESEM images in Figure 3a,b show the morphology
of the physical mixtures of MoS2 with GpowA and GpowC,
respectively. The circled regions show
the MoS2 components in the two cases and the same can be
confirmed by the composite energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) maps
(Figure 3c,d). The
EDS maps for the individual elements are shown in Figure S3a,b where the blue, red, and green colors represent
the regions rich in C, Mo, and S, respectively. The yellow colored
region in the composite EDS maps (Figure 3c,d) shows regions containing both molybdenum
and sulfur elements (a combination of red color denoting Mo and green
color denoting S appears as yellow), whereas the blue color represents
the graphene region. The EDS maps show the presence of both the blue
and yellow regions that appear together in various parts of the sample
indicating the presence of mixed as well as segregated phases, which
is typical of mechanically mixed components.

images of the additive mixtures (a,c) GpowA–MoS2 and (b,d) GpowC–MoS2.

TEM imaging and analysis were carried out to further study the Morphology and Structure in detail. For GpowA,
thin and large area graphene sheets with well-defined edges can be
observed under the low magnification TEM image shown in Figure 4a. The selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern shows diffraction spots indicating that
GpowA flakes are highly crystalline graphene. The inset of Figure 4a shows the high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) image for these flakes. The intensity analysis of the
fringes reveals a lattice constant of 0.235 nm, which is close to
the expected value of 0.246 nm of the lattice parameter of graphene’s
triangular lattice structure.34 GpowC also
shows graphene flakes, however, with some amount of aggregation and
smaller flake size (Figure 4b). The HRTEM image presented in the inset shows the layer
spacing of the sheets to be 0.38 nm, which is higher than that of
graphite (0.337 nm) indicating an increase in the interlayer spacing.
This is consistent with the presence of functional groups deduced
from Raman spectra, which contributes to the larger interlayer spacing
and exfoliation. Diffraction spots in the SAED pattern (inset of Figure 4b) confirm the crystallinity
of the GpowC flakes. However, it can be noticed from HRTEM that the
lattice order across the flakes is poor when compared to GpowA and
further confirms the presence of higher amount of defects in GpowC.
In Figure 4c, the wrinkled
sheets distinctive of chemically synthesized MoS2 can be
easily identified. Thin sheets can be identified near the periphery
of the MoS2 curls, whereas thicker stacked regions can
be seen in other regions. The HRTEM image shows the stacked MoS2 region where the interlayer spacing is 0.62 nm that matches
well with the previous reports.35,36 The diffused rings
in the SAED pattern (inset of Figure 4c) indicates that the synthesized MoS2 is
nanocrystalline with no long-range order.

TEM images along with the SAED
patterns (inset) of the as-prepared
mixtures of MoS2 with GpowA and GpowC are shown in Figure 4d,e. The low magnification
image of GpowA–MoS2 shows the presence of the wrinkled
MoS2 structure along with the thin flat flakes of GpowA,
confirming the presence of both the components. Figure 4e shows a region where the wrinkled MoS2 can be seen on the edges of the GpowC flake. Unlike GpowA–MoS2, the individual components in the GpowC–MoS2 mixture cannot be identified easily under TEM.

2.2 Lubricant Properties of the Additives
Four types of
industrial oils, base axle oil, base transmission oil,
compressor oil, and SN 500 oil, were used for the tribological studies.
Base axle oil, transmission oil (without lubricants/additives), and
SN500 are composed of mineral oils, whereas compressor oil is composed
of polyalkylene glycol derivatives. To understand the functional groups
present in the oils, FT-IR spectral analyses of as-supplied oils were
carried out and are presented in Figure S4. It is found that in all the four oils, strong peaks observed at
2850 cm–1 and at around 2930–3000 cm–1 arise from the asymmetric C–H bending vibrations
of the methyl and methylene group. Symmetric bending vibration of
the CH2 group is seen at 1458 cm–1. A
band at 1376 cm–1 arises due to symmetric CH3 bending vibration of the methyl group. A weak band at 720
cm–1 is attributed to out-of-plane stretching vibration
of the C–H group. The FT-IR spectral profile is very similar
for the base axle and transmission oils and consists mainly of hydrocarbon
signatures.37 In the case of SN500, a band
at 1110 cm–1 is observed which indicates the presence
of C–O group in addition to hydrocarbon signatures. It can
be clearly seen that compressor oil has a very different spectral
profile with strong peaks due to C–O (1110 cm–1) and −OH (3400 cm–1) due to glycol and
indicates its polar nature. Axle and transmission oils are nonpolar,
whereas SN500 is slightly polar and compressor oil is polar in nature.

The nanoadditives, 0.05 wt% of MoS2, GpowA, GpowC, and
the mixtures of GpowA or C (0.03 wt%) with MoS2 (0.02 wt%),
were dispersed in the above mentioned industrial oils by sonication.
The photographs of the dispersions in various oils are shown in Figure S5. The stability of the dispersions was
monitored by measuring UV–vis absorption after day 1, 7, and
14 and their absorption intensities were compared (Figure S6). GpowA and its composite showed the poorest stability
with the absorbance reduced to <20% after two weeks in all oils.
For most cases, MoS2, GpowC, and GpowC–MoS2 showed better stability with absorbance reduction not less than
60% after 2 weeks.

The antifriction and the antiwear properties
for each additive
in various lubricating oils were evaluated using the four-ball friction
tester. The friction and wear tests were conducted at a constant load
of 400 N and at a rotating speed of 1200 rpm for 60 min at 75 °C.
The lubricating oils with additives were sonicated prior to the friction
test. The details of sample preparations and tests are given in the Experimental Section. The plots of the percentage
change in the coefficient of friction (COF) and wear scar diameter
(WSD) of the steel balls after addition of the active materials in
comparison with the as-supplied oils are shown in Figure 5a,b, respectively. The plots
show a relative change in the COF and WSD values when additives are
added to the as-obtained oils. A value lower than zero (negative value)
signifies that the COF or WSD for the industrial oil with the additive
is lower than that of just the as-supplied oil (with no additives),
which is indicative of the antifriction or antiwear property of the
additives. The COF scans of the as-supplied industrial oils are shown
in Figure S7.

Figure 5 Plot of % change in (a)
COF and (b) WSD in various industrial oils
containing nanoadditives and their mixtures with respect to the values
obtained from the corresponding as-supplied oils (load, 400 N; rotating
speed, 1200 rpm; T, 75 °C; t, 60 min).

From Figure 5, it
can be seen that GpowA sample showed a significant reduction in the
COF when dispersed in axle oil (40% reduction), whereas the improvement
in the COF for transmission oil is 10%. However, COF of GpowA did
not show any improvement in compressor oil and slightly increased
in SN500. WSD for GpowA reduced for all the oils with highest reduction
observed for SN500 (50%). For GpowC, the COF decreased 12% in compressor
oil and increased for all other oils. On the contrary, however, WSD
for GpowC was reduced to 50% for SN500, 17% for transmission, 12%
for compressor, and 1% for axle oils. MoS2 when dispersed
in oils showed significant reduction in the COF for axle (60%), transmission
(10%), and compressor (10%) oils except for SN500. In terms of WSD,
MoS2 showed improvement of antiwear with SN500 (42%), axle
(7%), and transmission (1%) oils except for compressor oil. The COF
values increased for GpowA–MoS2 mixture in axle
and transmission oils, whereas the change was negligible in SN500.
However, there was a reduction of 9% in the COF values with the GpowA–MoS2 dispersions in compressor oil. The % reduction in the WSD
for GpowA–MoS2 mixture was 55% in SN 500 oil. The
same additive mixture led to a reduction of 12% WSD in transmission
oil, whereas there was no significant change in axle oil and 15% increase
of WSD was observed in compressor oil. GpowC–MoS2 mixture showed no reduction in COF in any of the industrial oils
and it seemed to contribute increased friction in axle and transmission
oil. WSD also showed no improvement in this case for axle, transmission,
and compressor oils. The only improvement with GpowC–MoS2 mixture was observed for SN500 with a 35% lower WSD than
that for base oil.

The evidence of reduction in the wear of
the steel balls with the
addition of the nanoadditives can also be confirmed by FESEM imaging
of the worn steel surfaces after the tribology test. The FESEM images
of the wear scars of various additives in different industrial oils
are given in Figures S8–S13. We
have also looked for evidence of any tribofilm formation in the wear
scar region using FESEM and EDS. The obtained results (in atomic %)
of the EDS of the wear surface lubricated with various nanoadditives
in a few oils, SN500 and axle oil, are summarized in Table 1. In Table 1, Fe, Cr, and Si contributions shown are
from steel ball itself, C contribution can be from oil and GpowA/C
additives, Mo from MoS2 and O may be from steel ball surface
or due to additive oxidation. The higher contributions to C and Mo
on the wear surface when compared with that of base oil arising from
the presence of additive particles on steel surface indicate that
a tribofilm formation during rubbing is responsible for better lubricant
performance.12,16

Table 1 EDS Analysis
(Atomic % Values) of
the Wear Surface of the Steel Balls after Tribology Experiments (Four
Ball Tester, Load, 400 N; Rotating Speed, 1200 rpm; T, 75 °C; t, 60 min) Employing Axle Oil and
SN500 Oil with Various Nanoadditives of Graphene and MoS2 and Also Using Compressor Oil Containing Nanoadditives Treated with
Oleylamine as a Surfactant
The superior antifriction and antiwear performance
of GpowA, particularly
in axle and transmission oils can be associated with its compatibility
with the hydrocarbon oils. GpowA being highly graphitic can become
more dispersible in nonpolar, axle, and transmission oils with high
hydrocarbon content during rubbing under a load aiding the formation
of a better tribofilm. This is supported by the comparison of the
morphology of the surfaces tested under base axle oil and with the
additive given in Figure 6. Figure 6a,b
shows that the surface is very rough and severe scuffing can be observed
in the case of base axle oil. On comparison to the base oil, the diameter
of the wear scar with the additive is smaller, which is indicative
of the anti-wear property (Figure 6c), and furthermore, the surface covered with the axle
oil containing GpowA is significantly smoother with less scuffing
(Figure 6d). Additionally,
larger flakes of GpowA can be seen on the wear surface clearly indicating
the formation of a tribofilm (Figure 6d). The EDS also shows a higher amount of carbon content
in the wear region in the case of GpowA in axle oil (Table 1). No particular improvement
in the COF for GpowA in a compressor and SN500 oils is observed may
be because of its less dispersibility in polar oils. However, the
EDS results show that the carbon content in the wear region is highly
increased (Table 1),
and FESEM shows the presence of large flakes (Figure S12b) on the worn surface for GpowA in SN500. This
is attributed to its good anti-wear property in SN500 though it does
not improve the COF, which indicates the formation of a nonuniform
tribofilm in polar oils.38 GpowC shows
improved antifriction only in the case of compressor oil (Figure 5), which can be associated
with its compatibility with highly polar nature due to −OH
and −C–O functionalized GpowC. However, GpowC shows
good antiwear property in most of the oils except for axle oil. EDS
(Table 1) also shows
high carbon content on the wear surface for GpowC in SN500 oil, whereas
less C content in the case of axle oil. FESEM images of the wear surface
for GpowC in SN500 (Figures S11c and S12c) show less scuffing compared to base SN500 oil (Figures S11a and S12c) and GpowC in axle oil (Figures S8c and S9c). Better anti-wear but less
anti-friction property of GpowC indicates that it forms unevenly distributed
particles in the tribofilms.38 MoS2 seems to favor antifriction and antiwear property in most
of the oils (Figure 5). However, it is noticeable that though it shows a 60% COF reduction
in axle oil, the wear reduction is only 7% in the same oil. Accordingly,
EDS shows the presence of very less Mo in the wear tracks of MoS2 in axle oil when compared to SN500 oil (where it showed higher
wear reduction). This may indicate that the tribofilm deterioration
is faster than the film formation rate in the case of MoS2 in axle oil.39

Figure 6 FESEM images of the rubbing
surfaces in (a) base axle oil and (b)
magnified image of (a), (c) GpowA in axle oil, and (d) magnified image
of GpowA on the wear scar after the tribology test.

The COF performance can also be correlated with the flake
size
and crystallinity of the additives. From TEM, FESEM, and particle
size analysis, it is noticed that GpowA has a very large flake size
with few defects and MoS2 exists as extended films consisting
of nanosheets with spherical aggregates. Such large layered sheets
allow the contact surface to slide over each other thereby reducing
the frictional force.18 The defects of
GpowC appear to be detrimental for friction, causing film deterioration.
However, the small flake size of GpowC may allow it to embed in the
surface microstructure thereby reducing wear. Earlier studies have
shown that graphene with extended and ordered lattice offers superior
tribological properties, whereas the presence of defects can cause
faster deterioration under load.40,41 In another
recent report on the tribological properties of different forms of
rGO, it is concluded that rGO with more lattice defects can lead to
an increase in the COF due to aggregation.42

In the case of physical mixtures of GpowA–MoS2 and GpowC–MoS2, in general, the additives do not
improve the COF in most of the oils. There is no considerable reduction
in wear scars as well except in the case of SN500 oil (Figure 5). Accordingly, EDS shows an
increase in the carbon content on the wear surface only in the case
of SN500 oil for both mixtures (Table 1). The examination of wear surface also indicates the
presence of debris in the case of GpowA–MoS2 (Figures S11e and S12e) and GpowC–MoS2 (Figure S12 f) additives in SN500
oil. Aggregated and rough debris of additives can be noticed in the
case of GpowA–MoS2 in SN500, which is indicative
of a very patchy tribofilm formation that aids in antiwear but not
in antifriction property.38 This indicates
that a physical mixture was not favorable for smooth sliding of surfaces.43,44 Hou et al. have shown that rGO/MoS2 heterostructures
formed by chemical synthesis are suitable for improved lubrication
rather than a physical mixture.24 Previous
studies have demonstrated that the presence of graphene allows for
better retention of the tribofilm and passivates MoS2 from
oxidation thereby allowing the formation of a thicker and more durable
tribofilm.25,45 However, in the present case,
a physical mixture of graphene and MoS2 would not have
helped the above cause.

The effect of using oleylamine, as a
surfactant, on the lubrication
properties was also studied for the nanoadditives dispersed in compressor
oil. As there is a slight positive effect on the COF values for all
nanoadditives in compressor oil, we have examined the further impact
of adding surfactant-mixed additives to the compressor oil in this
work. For this, the additives were first wetted with oleylamine (weight
ratio 10:1; 10 parts of additive and 1 part of oleylamine) before
dispersing in the oil using an ultrasonicator. Figure 7 compares the COF and WSD of the compressor
oil samples with and without oleylamine. It can be seen from the plot
that the addition of oleylamine leads to a higher reduction in the
COF in all cases except GpowC. With the addition of oleylamine, the
reduction in the COF values increased by an extra 6, 25, 5 and 15%
for GpowA, MoS2, GpowA–MoS2, and GpowC–MoS2, respectively (Figure 7a). The highest reduction was observed in the case of MoS2. Chen et al. reported a similar effect wherein the extreme
pressure property of MoS2 was hugely enhanced in the presence
of oleylamine.46 Oleic acid-modified graphene
is also reported to have improved tribological properties in the gear
oil polyalphaolefin-9 since oleic acid improves both solubility and
dispersibility of graphene in the oil.47 The positively charged amine group from the oleylamine molecules
tends to bind with the negatively charged surface of MoS2, whereas the nonpolar hydrocarbon end of oleylamine easily disperses
in the oil, thereby resulting in better dispersions. The improved
antifriction and antiwear properties with nanoadditives, particularly,
MoS2 and its mixtures with GpowA and GpowC complement the
fact that oleylamine binding to MoS2 improves the interaction
with the graphene and aid to form a tribofilm. A similar trend of
the effect of addition of oleylamine on the anti-wear properties can
be observed in Figure 7b. Upon addition of oleylamine, the WSD reduces by an additional
15, 22, and 12% for MoS2, GpowA–MoS2,
and GpowC–MoS2, respectively. There was no significant
change in the WSD for GpowA, whereas it slightly increased for GpowC
with the addition of oleylamine. EDS analysis of the wear surface
shows that there is a considerable increase in the Mo and S percentage
content in the case of MoS2, GpowA–MoS2, and GpowC–MoS2 in compressor oil with oleylamine
(Table 1). For GpowA
or GpowC in compressor oil with olelylamine, no mentionable increase
in the carbon content is observed on the wear surface (Table 1), and accordingly visible signatures
of the additive are not seen in FESEM images given in Figure 8b,c when compared to that of
MoS2 and mixtures (Figure 8d–f). This indicates that oleylamine interacts
with MoS2 rather than with graphene. EDS mapping of wear
surface for GpowC–MoS2 in compressor oil with oleylamine
shown in Figure 9 confirms
the presence of MoS2 on the wear tracks.

3 Conclusions
Our studies on the tribological
properties of synthesized powders
of graphene, MoS2, and their mixtures in various industrial
oils demonstrate that the antifriction and antiwear contribution of
different nanoadditives largely depend on the type of oil. The illustration
of reduction in friction and wear in universal base oils is only indicative
and may not hold true for all the industrially used oils. The COF
and WSD along with EDS and FESEM characterization of the wear surface
are performed to understand the tribofilm formation. GpowA with high-quality
graphene flakes show a 60% reduction in the COF and a 15% reduction
in WSD in axle oil. Better antifriction is attributed to the compatibility
of GpowA with nonpolar axle oil and a larger flake size of GpowA.
The presence of GpowA flakes on wear surface supports the improved
tribological property. GpowC shows a 12% reduction in the COF only
in compressor oil but good antiwear in most of the oils with 12–50%
reduction in WSD. The COF reduction can be attributed to the compatibility
of functionalized GpowC with polar compressor oil. MoS2 shows good antifriction and antiwear in most of the oils with 60–10%
COF reduction and 40–7% WSD reduction. Friction coefficient
and wear scar analysis from this study reveal that highly crystalline
graphene flakes and MoS2 sheets with a larger particle
size are good for antifriction properties, whereas functionalized
graphene with a smaller size is better for antiwear properties. The
larger flakes reduce friction by efficiently sliding between the contact
surfaces, whereas smaller aggregates embed in the microstructure reducing
a progressive wear. The physical mixtures of MoS2 with
both types of graphene are found to have poor antifriction and antiwear
properties. The modification of MoS2 with the oleylamine
surfactant not only promotes dispersion stability but also improves
antifriction (12–15% COF reduction) and antiwear properties
(4–7% WSD reduction) of mixtures of MoS2 with both
graphene types and, particularly, of MoS2 with additional
25% COF and 15% WSD reduction than in as-supplied compressor oil.
Wear surface analysis shows more contribution from MoS2 indicating that oleylamine interacts largely with MoS2, while improving the synergy between the constituents in additive
mixtures for better lubrication.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
Four types
of industrial oils, base axle oil, base transmission oil, compressor
oil, and SN 500 oil were used for the tribological studies. Base axle
oil (without lubricants/additives) and transmission oils (without
lubricants/additives) are composed of mineral oils and compressor
oil is composed of polyalkylene glycol derivatives. SN500 (Solvent
Neutral 500), categorized to grade 1 by American Petroleum Institute,
is refined from petroleum crude oil and contains more than 0.3% sulfur
by weight. Two types of graphene powders, GpowA and GpowC, were provided
by Graphene Center, Tata Steel Limited. MoS2 nanosheets
were synthesized using a hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis,
200 μmol of molybdenyl acetylacetonate powder was dissolved
in 30 mL of toluene, and 400 μmol of sulfur powder was then
added followed by the addition of 0.1 mL of hydrazine hydrate and
stirred well. This mixture was then transferred to a Teflon autoclave
which was sealed and kept at 200 °C for 24 h in a hot air oven.
The obtained powder was collected, washed, and stored in a dry atmosphere.

FESEM, TESCAN MIRA 3 LM, and attached Bruker Nano XFlash 6130 were
used to study surface morphology of nanosheets and perform EDS. Raman
spectroscopy studies were carried out using a HORIBA XploRA PLUS spectrometer.
An FEI Technai, HRTEM (T20 S-TWIN TEM, 200 kV) was used to acquire
high-resolution images. Particle size measurement was performed using
a HORIBA Laser Scattering Particle Size Distribution Analyzer LA-960.

4.2 Tribological Characterization
The
nanoadditives such as MoS2, GpowA, GpowC, and the mixtures
of graphene with MoS2, were all dispersed in four types
of industrial oils (axle, transmission, compressor, and SN500) to
study their effective tribological properties. The effect of oleylamine
as a surfactant on the above additives in compressor oil was also
studied. The lubricant was prepared by mixing 0.05 wt % of the given
additives into the oils. The powders were directly added to those
oils to disperse using a bath sonicator for 6 h (2 h continuous mode
and 30 min gap to cool the bath temperature down). Five sets of dispersions
containing GpowA (0.05 wt%), GpowC (0.05 wt%), MoS2 (0.05
wt%), and mixtures of graphene with MoS2; GpowA (0.03 wt%)–MoS2 (0.02 wt%), GpowC (0.03 wt%)–MoS2 (0.02
wt%), were prepared for each oil type. In the study of compressor
oil with oleylamine, the additives were first wetted with oleylamine
(weight ratio 10:1) before dispersing in the oil using an ultrasonicator.

The four-ball friction tester (ASTM standard D4172-04)48 was employed to study the lubricant capabilities
of the oil containing the above-mentioned nanoadditives. The lubricant
oils were sonicated for 5 min just before conducting the friction
experiment. The friction and wear tests were conducted at a constant
load of 400 N and at a rotating speed of 1200 rpm for 60 min at 75
°C. The relative motion of the top ball with respect to the bottom
ones results in the formation of a circular wear scar on the bottom
balls (see Scheme 1). The WSD of the three bottom balls was measured using FESEM and
the average value was used to evaluate the wear properties. The friction
coefficient values were also acquired during the ball rotation. The
surface of the steel balls was observed under FESEM for a morphological
study.
