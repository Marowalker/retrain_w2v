Cubic boron nitride (cBN) exhibits superior hardness
and strength as compared with other ceramics that are commonly used
as abrasives and cutting tools. The recently synthesized polycrystalline
cBN bulk material with ultrafine nanotwin substructures possesses
a remarkable combination of high hardness, fracture toughness, and
thermal stability. The twin substructure has been demonstrated to
exert dislocation-blocking effect similar to grain boundary, leading
to strengthening of materials. So far, the synthesis of cBN nanoparticles
with ultrafine nanotwin substructures has not yet been realized. Herein,
we report on the synthesis of cBN nanoparticles from onion-like boron
nitride (oBN) under high pressure and high temperature. Multiple characterization
methods, including X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy, revealed that the as-prepared cBN
nanoparticles contained high-density nanotwin substructures. The use
of the highly wrinkled oBN precursor and well-designed synthetic method
were the key to obtain these unique ultrafine nanotwinned cBN nanoparticles.

Introduction
The most important superhard materials,
diamond and cubic boron nitride (cBN) are extensively applied in turning,
cutting, grinding, drilling, and other modern processing operations.1 Despite its inferior hardness compared with diamond,
cBN outcompetes diamond in many applications owing to its superior
thermal and chemical stability. For instance, cBN has less affinity
for iron than diamond and is therefore very suitable for cutting and
processing of iron-based alloys. Tools based on superhard cBN materials,
such as polycrystalline cBN cutters, cBN grinding wheels, and cBN-coated
drill bits, are widely used in the modern machining industry.

Crystals of cBN were first synthesized in 1957 by Wentorf using a
high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) method in the presence of
metal nitrides as catalysts.2 Over the
following decades, cBN has been prepared via numerous methods, such
as vapor phase deposition,3 solvothermal
reaction,4 laser ablation,5 and plasma spraying.6 However,
to the best of our knowledge, domains with nanotwin substructures
have only occasionally been observed in synthetic cBN nanocrystals,7−10 and
few studies have reported the synthesis of cBN with ubiquitous ultrafine
nanotwin substructures. Recently, significant breakthroughs in the
synthesis of cBN and diamond polycrystalline bulk materials with pervasively
ultrafine nanotwin substructures have been achieved by directly transforming
onion-like precursors under HPHT conditions.11,12 These
unique onion-like precursors possess a highly wrinkled and curved
structure that favors the evolution of high-density nanotwin substructures
during the phase transition process. Although ultrafine nanotwinned
cBN and diamond polycrystalline bulk materials have been synthesized,
cBN and diamond nanopowders possessing high-density ultrafine nanotwin
substructures have not been reported to date.

In this study,
nanoscaled cBN particles containing ubiquitous ultrafine nanotwin
substructures were successfully synthesized using the onion-like boron
nitride (oBN) precursor in conjunction with a well-designed synthetic
method. Potassium chloride (KCl) was used as a medium to effectively
separate the precursor nanoparticles, so that each oBN nanoparticle
would transform into a cBN nanoparticle with high-density nanotwin
substructures individually. Microstructures of the oBN precursor and
the obtained ultrafine nanotwinned cBN nanoparticles were examined
in detail using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
to elucidate the structural evolution.

Results and Discussions
The precursor oBN nanoparticles
(Figure 1a) were prepared
according to a previously reported method.13 Statistical analysis of more than 600 nanoparticles revealed that
the oBN nanoparticles had diameters ranging from approximately 10–400
nm with an average diameter of 130 nm, as shown in Figure 1b. Figure 1c presents an HRTEM image of an oBN nanoparticle,
revealing concentric graphite-like shells with a high degree of structural
disorder due to numerous defects such as lattice puckering and bending
as well as stacking faults. As shown in Figure 1d, the reflection peaks in the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern for oBN shifted toward a lower angle compared with hexagonal
BN (hBN); the intershell spacing of oBN calculated from the diffraction
peak at 2θ ≈ 25.3° was 0.352 nm, which is larger
than the corresponding values of 0.3328 nm for the (002) reflection
of hBN and 0.334 nm for the (003) reflection of rhombohedral BN (rBN).14 This lattice expansion likely originated from
internal stress caused by the highly curved shell and stacking faults. Figure 1e shows the Raman
spectrum of oBN, which contained a weak excitation peak at 1370 cm–1 and a broaden peak centered at approximately 1400
cm–1. The band at 1370 cm–1 corresponded
to telescopic vibration (E2g mode) of the B–N in
the hexagonal plane,15 while the broaden
peak mainly originated from the structural disorder and aberrant spacing
between the atoms of the curved shell. The weak intensity of the E2g mode and the broaden peak indicate that oBN nanoparticles
had a high degree of structural disorder, which is consistent with
the HRTEM observations.

was highly structurally disordered and had an enlarged interlayer

Figure 2a presents the XRD pattern of the synthetic cBN nanoparticles.
Four characteristic peaks were observed at 43.39°, 50.28°,
74.33°, and 90.22°, which correspond to the (111), (200),
(220), and (311) crystalline planes of cBN, respectively. To further
examine the intrinsic structure, the Raman spectrum was measured as
shown in Figure 2b.
On the basis of previously calculated and experimental results,16,17 both of the excitation peaks could be assigned to cBN. The distinct
peaks at 1055 and 1303 cm–1 can be attributed to
scattering by the transverse optical and longitudinal optical phonon
modes of cBN, respectively. It is worth noting that the peak shapes
displayed low-frequency asymmetric broadening owing to the presence
of numerous defects in the crystal.18 The
presence of numerous defects in the crystal will break the translation
symmetry, relax the conservation law of wave vector, and lead to the
low-frequency asymmetry profile of the Raman peak.

Figure 3a presents a low-magnification
bright-field TEM image of the synthesized cBN nanoparticles, which
possessed diameters on the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers.
The cBN nanocrystals were quasispherical, as previously reported for
diamond nanoparticles.19,20 Such a morphology in nanoparticles
results from a tendency to achieve lower surface energy. Statistical
analysis of 485 as-prepared c-BN nanoparticles observed in TEM images
revealed that the diameter ranged from 10 to 300 nm with an average
diameter of approximately 85 nm, as shown in Figure 3c. Figure 3b shows a selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
pattern taken from a wide area, revealing the presence of the cBN
structure in accordance with the XRD results. The diffraction rings
were, respectively, indexed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (400),
and (331) planes of cBN.

SAED pattern of the synthesized cBN nanoparticles. The diffraction
rings were corresponding to different crystal planes of cBN. (c) Size
distribution taken from 485 nanoparticles. The average diameter of
the nanoparticles was approximately 85 nm.

The substructure of the synthesized
cBN nanoparticles was further examined via scanning TEM (STEM) images. Figure 4a–c displays
a series of annular dark-field (ADF)-STEM images of the same region
of the prepared cBN crystals at different tilt angles. Under ADF imaging,
the lattice direction changes across the twin boundary, resulting
in a change in diffraction contrast. Twin substructures can be observed
in each nanoparticles as the specimen was tilted along the x- and y-axes. Figure 4d presents a typical ADF-STEM image of an
individual nanoparticle viewed along the [101] zone axis, in which
the twinning-induced diffraction contrast is clearly visible. It is
readily apparent that the interior of the cBN nanoparticle contained
abundant twin substructures.

synthesized cBN nanocrystals at different tilt angles. (d) ADF-STEM
image of an individual cBN nanoparticle, revealing the presence of
plentiful twin substructures within the nanoparticle.

The twin substructures in cBN nanoparticles
of various sizes were further examined in detail via HRTEM. Figure 5a presents a TEM
image of a cBN nanoparticle and its corresponding SAED pattern. The
two-fold pattern indicates a successive twin substructure in the nanoparticle. Figure 5b–e shows
HRTEM images of cBN nanoparticles with diameters of approximately
70, 110, 210, and 270 nm, respectively. Notably, high-density of nanotwin
substructures were consistently observed in the synthesized cBN nanoparticles
with different sizes. In the phase transition process, the existence
of plentiful defects in oBN nanoparticles greatly promoted the formation
of phase-transition twins. Hence, the naturally puckered BN layers
and the high concentration of stacking faults in the precursor nanoparticles
were the main reasons for the formation of high-density phase-transition
twins in the resulting cBN nanoparticles. In comparison, flawlessly
graphite-like BN precursors commonly generate cBN nanoparticles with
negligible nanotwins.7,8,10 As
shown in the HRTEM images, some stacking faults were also observed
in the synthesized cBN nanoparticles.

SAED pattern (inset). (b–e) HRTEM images of nanoparticles with
diameters of approximately (b) 70, (c) 110, (d) 210, and (e) 270 nm,
the insets show the low-magnification bright-field images of the corresponding
nanoparticles. Stacking faults and twin boundaries are indicated by
red triangles and yellow lines. (f) Statistical twin thickness from
316 nanotwins. The twin thickness ranged from approximately 1 to 50
nm, and most twins had thickness less than 5 nm.

Figure 5f shows the twin thickness distribution measured
from the 316 nanotwins observed in the HRTEM images. The most of twins
in the synthesized cBN nanoparticles have the thickness less than
5 nm, but twin thickness ranges from approximately 1 to 50 nm. In
comparison, the reported nanotwinned cBN polycrystalline bulk material
did not exhibit relatively wide twins (>15 nm).11 This difference is mainly attributable to the further extrusion
and plastic deformation of adjacent grains in polycrystalline bulk
during densification. The formation of deformation twins relies on
the motion of {111}⟨112⟩ partial dislocations during
plastic deformation.21 Thus, numerous deformation
twins were generated inside the nanograins of cBN bulk material during
the densification process. In this work, as the oBN nanoprecursors
were uniformly separated by the KCl medium, the cBN nanoparticles
did not undergo severe plastic deformation during the densification.
Consequently, the number of deformation twins in the cBN nanoparticles
was largely reduced compared with that in polycrystalline bulk material,
resulting in a wide range in twin thicknesses. As is well-known, nanotwinning
reinforcement has been proved in polycrystalline bulk materials of
both metals and covalent materials. Therefore, the synthesized cBN
nanoparticles with high-density nanotwin substructures may also have
an enhancement on its properties, which is worthy anticipated.

Conclusions
Ultrafine nanotwinned cBN nanoparticles
were synthesized using the unique oBN nanoparticles as the starting
material and an elaborate synthetic method. The highly wrinkled and
defective oBN prefer to phase transition into nanotwinned cBN under
HPHT conditions, and the additive KCl medium can effectively separate
the precursor nanoparticles, thus leading to the direct transformation
of each oBN nanoparticle into individual cBN nanoparticles with high-density
nanotwin substructures inside. Further microstructural observations
reveal that the average diameter of the synthetic cBN nanoparticles
is about 85 nm, and the interior of cBN nanoparticles contains pervasively
ultrafine nanotwin substructures with thickness mostly less than 5
nm. Our findings demonstrate a new strategy for fabricating nanosized
cBN particles with nanotwinned morphologies by view of suitable precursor
selection and synthesis process adjustment.

Experimental Methods
Unlike the previous synthesis
process of nanotwinned cBN polycrystalline bulk material, the prefabricated
blocks used for the HPHT experiments in the present work were composed
of a mixture of oBN nanopowders and KCl. The detailed manufacturing
process of the prefabricated blocks was as follows. The oBN nanopowders
and KCl were initially added to methanol, and after the KCl had fully
dissolved, the oBN nanoparticles were further dispersed via ultrasonication.
To remove the methanol solvent and avoid agglomeration of the oBN
nanopowders, the magnetic stirring was continued overnight at 50 °C
to afford a solid powder consisting of uniformly distributed oBN and
KCl. This powder was pressed into blocks for the HPHT experiments.
The synthesis experiments were performed using a double-stage T25
multi-anvil system (Rockland Research Corporation). A standard compress
10/5 sample assembly, consisting of a 10 mm Al2O3 doped MgO octahedron with a Re heater and a LaCrO3 thermal
insulator, was used. The temperature was directly measured using C-type
W5%Re–W26%Re thermocouples, and the pressure was estimated
from previously determined calibration curves. The sample was compressed
to 15 GPa at room temperature and then heated to a final temperature
of 1800 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min. The final temperature
was maintained for 5–30 min. The melting point of KCl is more
than 2000 °C at 15 GPa, which is far above the temperature used
in this experiment. Therefore, KCl only acts as a pressure medium
to isolate the nanoprecursors.22 After
the pressure and temperature had completely released to ambient conditions,
the cBN nanoparticles were washed with deionized water to remove the
KCl.

XRD patterns were acquired using an X-ray diffractometer
(D8 ADVANCE, Bruker) with Cu Kα radiation. Raman spectra were
collected using a LabRAM-HR spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin-Yvon) with
532 nm excitation (20 mW YAG laser) at ambient conditions. TEM images
were recorded using a Talos F200X TEM/STEM (FEI) instrument operating
at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The TEM specimens were prepared
by evaporating a few droplets of an ethanolic solution of cBN nanoparticles
treated with ultrasonic onto carbon-coated copper grids.
