Polydiacetylenes (PDAs) are conjugative
polymers that demonstrate
color changes as a response to an external stimulus. In this study,
10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA) was mixed with a supporting polymer
including poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and polyurethane (PU), and the
mixture solution was electrospun to construct fiber composites. The
electrospun fibers were then photopolymerized using UV irradiation
to produce PEO–PDA and PU–PDA nanofiber mats with a
fiber diameter ranging from 130 nm to 2.5 μm. The morphologies
of both PEO–PDA and PU–PDA nanofibers were dependent
on electrospinning parameters such as the ratio of PCDA to PEO or
PCDA to PU and the total polymer concentrations. Scanning electron
microscopy images showed beaded fibers of PEO–PDA and PU–PDA
at 2 and 18 w/v % concentrations, respectively. Smooth fibers were
found when the solvent concentration was increased to 3.75 w/v % in
PEO–PDA and 25 w/v % in PU–PDA fibers. Both PEO–PDA
and PU–PDA nanofiber composites demonstrated excellent colorimetric
responses to the presence of Escherichia coli ATCC25922 bacterial cells and the changes in pH as external stimuli.
The nanofibers underwent a rapid colorimetric response when exposed
directly to E. coli ATCC25922 grown
on Luria–Bertani agar. The comparison between the PEO–PDA
and PU–PDA suggested that the combination of PEO and PDA is
favorable because it provides a sensitive response to the presence
of E. coli. The results were compared
with samples of a PDA polymer in the absence of a matrix polymer.
The colorimetric response was similar when the PDA polymer and the
PDA nanofiber composites were exposed to pH changes, and the color
change was found to occur at pH 10 and enhanced at pH 11–13.
The PDA-containing nanofiber composites showed stronger colorimetric
responses than those of the PDA polymer only, suggesting their potential
as biosensors and chemosensors.

Introduction
Bacterial infection
of wounds, including burns, diabetic foot ulcers,
and surgical-site infections, impact approximately 2 million people
and cost more than $18 billion in direct medical cost annually in
the United States.1 For example, chronically
infected diabetic foot ulcers are the most critical wound care problem
worldwide, and 14–24% of these cases eventually suffer an amputation.2 Wound dressings are typically used to protect
the wound and surrounding tissue from contamination and to promote
wound healing. Conventional wound dressings are generally not suitable
for chronic and acute wounds, nor are they suitable for treatment
or monitoring the infection status of chronic and acute wounds. Novel
strategies are in great need for early detection of wound infection
to prevent further complications and to enhance the healing process.
One recently used strategy is to introduce biosensors that can monitor
in situ the presence of bacteria in wounds and hence improve wound
care and management. A biosensor is an analytical device that is made
of an analyte in combination with a biological element such as an
enzyme, antibody, or nucleic acid.3,4 The biological
element interacts with the analyte, resulting in a biological response
that can be converted into electrical or electrochemical signals.5 In particular, colorimetric biosensors have been
attractive because of their ease of use, rapid response, high prevision,
accuracy, and cost-effectiveness.6 If colorimetric
biosensors could be integrated into wound dressings, the wound dressings
could potentially enable early detection of infections in wounds by
providing in situ monitoring of the wound condition via colorimetric
indication.7 Biosensors can function in
different transducers, including electrochemical, optical, electronic,
piezoelectric, gravimetric, and pyroelectric.8 In electrochemical biosensor development, conjugated polymers can
be used to create the bio-transducer components in the sensor.9 Polyaniline, polypyrrole, and polydiacetylene
(PDA) are mostly used conjugative polymers to construct electrochemical
biosensors because their electrochemical properties are usually associated
with visible colorimetric changes.10 PDAs
are especially attractive because they exhibit a blue-to-red color
transition visible to the naked eye when they are subjected to external
stimuli such as changes in temperature,7,11−13 pH,14 and the presence of bacterial cells,15 and aromatic compounds.16 PDAs were first synthesized by Wegner in 1969, who identified the
polymerization as a 1,4-addition reaction.17 The potential use of PDAs in developing biosensors was first reported
in 1993 when Bednarski et al. coated a glass slide with a PDA bilayer
and developed a direct colorimetric detection method for sialic acid,
a receptor-specific ligand for the influenza virus.18 Since then, a range of sensing systems were developed using
PDAs such as films,19 crystals,20 and fibers.21 Our
previous studies showed that PDAs can be used in nanofiber composites
for sensor applications, demonstrating their potential use in wound
dressings and medical textiles.7 Sensor
sensitivity is generally increased via an increase in the contact
surface area of biosensors. The surface area of nanofibers can be
exceptionally high because of small diameters and high aspect ratios
such as the diameter-to-length ratio. Nanofiber composites exhibit
excellent flexibility as well as high permeability, which meet ergonomic
and physiological preferences in the application of medical textiles
such as wound bandages and surgical dressings. Because of the high
cost and low spinnability of PDAs, the PDAs have been successfully
incorporated into fiber/nanofiber composites with other polymers,
such as polymethyl methacrylate, polystyrene, tetraethyl orthosilicate,
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), which serve as supporting components or
matrix polymers in the composites. The PDA-containing nanofiber composites
could be used to develop wound bandages and surgical dressings with
biosensing capabilities.10,22

In this study,
supporting polymers of PEO or polyurethane (PU)
were separately mixed with the PDA monomer, 10,12-pentacosadiynoic
acid (PCDA), and the mixtures were used in an electrospinning apparatus
to create nanofiber composites. The nanofibers were then photopolymerized
via UV irradiation resulting in PEO–PDA and PU–PDA nanofiber
composites. The biosensing properties of the PEO–PDA and PU–PDA
nanofiber composites were evaluated for their potential application
as wound bandages and surgical dressings. PEO is a linear, semi-crystalline,
biocompatible, nontoxic polymer approved for internal use in food,
cosmetics, and pharmaceutical and personal care products.23 PEO is widely used because of its amphiphilic
properties as well as its solubility in aqueous and organic solvents24 and its stability in air.25 On the other hand, PU is also frequently used in medical
products because of its good barrier properties and oxygen permeability.
PU has been traditionally proven to be a bio- and hemocompatible material.26 The electrospun nanofibers of PEO–PDA
and PU–PDA were exposed to Escherichia coli (ATCC25922) culture, and the colorimetric behaviors were monitored
to evaluate their biosensing properties. It was found that both nanofiber
composites demonstrated colorimetric responses (CRs) to E. coli; however, the colorimetric changes in the
PEO–PDA nanofibers responded differently than those changes
in PU–PDA nanofibers. The colorimetric properties were measured
using a photospectrometer as a function of exposure time to E. coli. The conditions of the bacterial culture,
such as pH in Luria–Bertani (LB) media have a great impact
on the bacteria and their growth. Thus, colorimetric responses in
the nanofiber composites were also monitored using the photospectrometer
as a function of pH in a buffer solution without the presence of E. coli to study the correlation between biosensing
behaviors and pH. The results showed no visible color changes in the
PDA nanofibers at pH < 11. Because most of known bacteria live
in pH from 6 to 7, the results suggested that no false signal in detecting
bacteria would occur at physiological pH. Our results suggested a
great potential of using the PDA-containing nanofiber composites in
wound bandages and surgical dressings to detect the presence of bacterial
infection and to continuously monitor wound health status.

Results
and Discussion
Fiber Morphology
Figure 1A,B shows the scanning electron
microscope (SEM) images
of PU–PDA and PEO–PDA electrospun fibers obtained at
different spinning conditions. Polymer concentration and mass ratios
of matrix polymers to PCDA (the monomer of PDA) had a great impact
on fiber morphology. The morphology of PU–PDA fibers was generally
different from that of PEO–PDA fibers. Beads on fibers were
present in the PEO–PDA fibers obtained at 2 w/v % concentrations
and the PU–PDA fibers obtained at 18 w/v % concentrations when
the mass ratio of matrix polymers to PCDA was 2:1. During electrospinning,
PDA solutions with low viscosity experienced a low viscoelastic force
resulting in a partial break up in the electrical jet. Because of
the effect of surface tension, free solvent molecules in the solution
accumulated into a spherical shape, causing a formation of beads.
The number of beads was significantly reduced when the concentrations
were higher at 25 w/v % for PU–PDA fibers and 3.75 w/v % for
PEO–PDA fibers. The mass ratio between matrix polymers to PCDA
had a similar effect on fiber morphology. Fewer beads were formed
at the high mass ratio (6:1) for both PU–PDA and PEO–PDA
fibers. The formation of beads was attributed to the insufficient
polymer chain entanglement at low concentrations. In principle, the
polymer chains are stretched by electrostatic forces during electrospinning,
resulting in linear fibers only if sufficient polymer chain entanglements
prevent breakage and discontinuity in the solidified fibers. A low
concentration of the polymers results in insufficient chain entanglements
that result in beaded fibers.23,29

Figure 1 SEM images of PU–PDA
(A) and PEO–PCDA (B) electrospun
fibers. Fibers presented in the upper row are prepared with a ratio
of 2:1 matrix polymers to PCDA, and those presented in the lower row
are prepared with a ratio of 6:1 matrix
polymers to PCDA. The images in the columns present fibers obtained
at low and high polymer concentrations. Graphs (C) and (D) depict
the average diameter of electrospun fibers for PU–PDA and PEO–PDA,
respectively.

Matrix polymers used
in electrospinning are primarily to enhance
the spinnability of PDAs because it is difficult to electrospin PDAs
alone owing to their impaired solubility and low viscosity. Therefore,
the concentration of the matrix polymer (PU or PEO) was calculated
based upon the mass ratio and total polymer concentration. Figure 1B,C shows the correlation
between the fiber diameter and the concentrations of PU and PEO, respectively.
The fiber diameters of the PDA fibers prepared with both PU and PEO
varied with the change in mass ratios. The diameter of fiber samples
of PU–PDA and PEO–PDA increased linearly with the increase
of the matrix polymer concentration (PU–PEO), which is attributed
to the higher viscosity and surface tension of the electrospinning
solution.30 In addition, beads on the string
were formed at low concentrations because of the low viscosity of
the electrospun solution. Coarse fibers were formed at the high mass
ratio of matrix polymers (PU or PEO) to PCDA. On the other hand, the
SEM images shown in Figure 1 suggest that the surface roughness of the fibers increased
with an increase in the fiber diameter. The surface roughness of PU–PDA
and PEO–PDA fibers appeared slightly different. This might
be due not only to the nature of different matrix polymers but also
to the different solvents used. Surface morphology of PEO and PDA
electrospun fibers was previously reported differently when different
solvents were used including chloroform, methylene chloride, and dimethyl
formamide.31

Chemical Analysis via ATR–FTIR
Colorimetric
changes in conjugated polymers are usually due to conformational changes
in the conjugated macromolecules such as PDAs. In this study, PDAs
were mixed with PEO or PU, resulting in PEO–PDA and PU–PDA
nanofiber composites. This leads to a question whether the PEO or
PU mixed with PDA has an effect on conjugated macromolecules at a
molecular level and hence influences electrochemical properties in
the nanofiber composites. Therefore, chemical analysis was carried
out via attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared
(ATR–FTIR) for PDAs including PDAs embedded in PEO and PU fibers
and PDA in the absence of matrix polymers. ATR–FTIR measurements
were conducted on samples in the blue phase prior to chromatic changes,
and the spectra are shown in Figure 2. Spectrum A corresponds to the PU–PDA fibers,
where the following resonance features were interpreted for characterization;
IR νmax (cm–1): 3324 (N–H
stretch), 2919–2847 (C–H stretch), 1692 (C=O
stretch), 1104 (C–O stretch), and 723 (C–H bend). Similar
features were observed in spectrum B representing PEO–PDA fibers;
IR νmax (cm–1): 2919–2847
(C–H stretch), 1691 (C=O stretch), 1097 (C–O
stretch), and 723 (C–H bend). The resulting resonance features
were similar to previously reported results for PDAs, and the spectra
were consistent with the anticipated structures.7,32 PDAs
synthesized in the absence of a matrix polymer were also characterized
by ATR–FTIR before the color transition and are shown in Figure 2. Spectrum C represents
PDA in the absence of a matrix polymer with key vibrational bands
originating at IR νmax (cm–1):
2918–2847 (C–H stretch), 1690 (C=O stretch),
and 722 (C–H bend). Resonance features that indicate the presence
of PDAs are seen on all spectra, where the most prominent stretch
is due to the carbonyl. Substitution at the terminal hydroxyl groups
of the dicarboxylic acid monomers is shown by the absence of resonance
features that correspond to those groups. The results suggest that
the characteristic macromolecular structures of PDA were not altered
after the composite polymer was formed with the matrix polymer. Thus,
the electrochemical and colorimetric properties are not significantly
altered in the nanofiber composites.33

signals correspond to PU–PDA fibers (A), PEO–PDA fibers
(B), and PDA (C).

Colorimetric Response To
Bacteria
PEO–PDA and
PU–PDA fiber composites were immersed in E.
coli culture, and their colorimetric properties were
monitored as a function of contact time. The fibers were in the blue
phase before they were immersed, and after immersion, the fibers demonstrated
color changes to red immediately. The fiber samples that were immersed
in a control dish containing only LB agar prepared without E. coli remained blue, and no visible colorimetric
change was observed. To confirm our hypothesis involving membrane-secreted
compounds, additional controls were investigated by using the pellet
or the supernatant. Our findings indicated that the fiber in contact
with the pellet underwent a color transition from blue to red, whereas
the fiber in contact with the supernatant did not fully show a red
shift. The fiber mat that was exposed to the supernatant appeared
purple. The change suggests that bacterially secreted proteins that
were present in the media might be capable of initiating the color
transition.15Figures S2 and S3 show photographs of colorimetric responses of the
PU–PDA and PEO–PDA fibers every 30 min from t = 0 min to t = 3 h, respectively. The
color changes were different in the fibers obtained at various electrospinning
parameters.

The color transition from blue to red was rapid
in the fibers with a high mass ratio (6:1). The slowest transition
of color was observed in the fibers that were prepared at the lowest
concentrations and the lowest mass ratio. It was found that the color
of beaded fibers remained unchanged for a longer time than that of
the fibers without a significant amount of beads. The beads on the
fibers might disturb the interaction with bacterial cells and cause
a delay in color transition. Continuous fibers without beads exhibited
a fast and prominent color change. The color change became less drastic
in the PEO–PDA fibers at 1.5 h and in the PU–PDA fibers
at 2.5 h. The intensity of the red color in the PEO–PDA fibers
reached its maximum after 3 h. A similar trend was found in the PU–PDA
fibers. The color transition continued, and no significant color change
was observed after 3 h. The PU–PDA fibers obtained at a mass
ratio of 6:1 and 18 w/v % concentration exhibited an early and vivid
color transition as compared to the rest of fibers. The color change
became more distinct as the pH of the solution increased and the concentration
of bacteria increased.

Representative reflectance spectra are
shown in Figure 3 for
the PEO–PDA fiber
mat that was obtained at a 2:1 mass ratio and 3.75 w/v % solvent concentration.
Untreated polymerized blue fiber mats that were used as controls showed
a slight increase in the reflectance value at 640 nm, but remained
unchanged at 540 nm. After the fibers were exposed to E. coli for 30 min, they started to change color
and exhibited a wide reflectance peak at 610 nm, which bypassed the
original peak at 640 nm. The reflectance switch on the spectra was
continuously developed when the interaction between the fibers and E. coli continued for 3 h.

Figure 3 Reflectance spectra of
the PEO–PDA fiber mat at a 2:1 mass
ratio and 3.75 w/v % solvent concentration over time after the exposure
to E. coli. The solid line represents
the blue PDA fibers (control), and the different dotted lines represent
the fibers after exposure to E. coli for different time periods.

A comparison between the PEO–PDA and PU–PDA
fibers
is made to investigate the colorimetric transition in different fiber
composites. Both the PEO–PDA and PU–PDA fibers obtained
at a 6:1 mass ratio showed a pronounced reflectance switch. It was
found that the low switch was shown by the fine fibers obtained at
a 2:1 PEO–PDA ratio and 2 w/v % polymer concentration, whereas
a high switch was shown by the coarse fiber obtained at a 6:1 PEO–PCDA
ratio and 3.75 w/v % polymer concentration. Our earlier discussion
on the fiber size indicated that an increase in the amount of PEO
in electrospinning solution influenced the fiber size, resulting in
an increase of the fiber diameter. The increase of the fiber diameter
thus expanded the exposed surface area and enhanced the color transition
from blue to red. Additionally, the fiber surface became rough with
the increase of the fiber diameter. The high reflectance of the color
switch from blue to red that was associated with the coarser fibers
was probably due to the high reflectance surface area of the rough
fibers.

Previous studies proposed that the mechanism responsible
for the
color change might be attributed to the release of endotoxins, such
as lipopolysaccharides, from the Gram-negative bacterial strain. As
membrane-active compounds are secreted by proliferating bacteria,
the PDA undergoes conformational transitions by perturbations that
disrupt hydrogen bonding of the head-groups and favor binding of positively
charged ions.15 Further studies that explore
the interaction between bacterial cells and PDAs are needed to investigate
the driving force of the color change as a response to E. coli.

The colorimetric response of PEO–PDA
and PU–PDA fibers
is presented in Figure 4. The % CR between the blue and red reflectance correlates to the
intensity of the color transition. Figure 4A shows that at the same time integral, the
PEO–PDA fibers obtained at the PEO–PCDA mass ratio of
2:1 and the concentrations of 2 w/v % demonstrated lowest % CRs (2.6–3.6),
which represent the lowest color transition. Figure 4B shows that at the same time integral, the
PU–PDA fibers obtained at the PU–PCDA mass ratio of
2:1 and the concentrations of 18% also presented lowest % CRs (1.7–2.9),
showing the lowest color transition. The increases in both mass ratio
and concentration for both fibers were able to enhance the colorimetric
response of the PDA-containing composites. It is in agreement with
the previous conclusion that the increase in the concentration of
the matrix polymer (PEO) increases the surface area of the fiber that
is in contact with the bacterial cells and enhances colorimetric response
behaviors. In addition, it is important to notice that by comparison
of Figure 4A,B, the
% CRs of the PEO–PDA composites were higher than those of the
PU–PDA composites at the similar spinning conditions, suggesting
faster color transition occurring in the PU–PDA composites.
For example, the maximum % CRs by the PEO–PDA and PU–PDA
are 15.2 and 10.6, respectively. This may be due to the interaction
between the two components in the composites, which include the sensing
component of PDA and the matrix polymer. The results show that the
combination of PEO and PDA give rise to a favorable and sensitive
response in the presence of E. coli. The mechanism of sensitive response by the PEO–PDA composites
needs further investigation.

Figure 4 The colorimetric response values of PEO–PDA
and PU–PDA
fibers after direct contact with E. coli for 3 h.

It can be noticed that both PU–PDA
(6:1 mass ratio and 18%)
and PEO–PDA (2:1 mass ratio and 3.75%) fibers demonstrated
a high % CR. These values were also associated with a relatively large
variation shown in Figure 4, suggesting that strong colorimetric responses might not
necessarily indicate high sensitivity and stability of color changes
in these fibers.

PEO–PDA and PU–PDA nanofiber
composites and PDA in
the absence of the matrix polymer were separately dispersed in buffer
solutions where the pH varied in the range of 0–14. The suspensions
were measured using ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis), and
the absorbance was used to calculate colorimetric responses. The absorbance
spectra of the samples immersed in the buffer solution with pH 0–9
were nearly overlapped, suggesting no color change in this range of
pH. When the pH increased to 10, 11, 12, and 13, the color of the
PEO–PDA and PU–PDA nanofiber suspensions changed from
blue to purple and finally to red. The color shift was significant
at pH 11–13. The changes were likely due to the high concentration
of the hydroxide ion at pH 11–13, which had a significant impact
on the chemical environment and hydrogen bonding of the PDAs.18,34 Previous work suggested that pH changes in PDA can alter the hydrogen
bonding of the carboxylic acid head groups, inducing a conformational
change in the PDA backbone that leads to a color transition of the
polymer.18,35 In this case, changes in the chemical environment
cause a reflectance shift because of shortening of the p-conjugated
bonds in the backbone of the polymer.36 In the blue phase, π electrons within the polymer backbone
are delocalized.37 As the hydrogen bonding
is disrupted by external stimuli, the π electrons become distorted
and the polymer reaches the red phase.38

The intensity of the color transition was clear at pH 11 when
the
PDA demonstrated a color of purple, given that the color transition
was reversible and was not fully completed at pH 11. When the pH was
further increased to 12, the PDA nanofibers in the solution became
red. The color change was captured by the increase of the colorimetric
response calculated by the absorbance at 640 nm (blue phase) and 540
nm (red phase). The colorimetric responses were plotted against the
pH in the buffer solutions, and the plots are shown in Figure 5. It was found that the color
transition from blue to red was promoted at pH 12 and 13. Then, the
colorimetric responses slightly dropped at the extremely alkaline
condition (pH = 14).

Figure 5 The colorimetric response of 100% PDA polymers, PEO–PDA,
and PU–PDA nanofiber composites as a function of pH when immersed
in buffer solutions.

Similar results were obtained using 100% PDAs in the absence
of
matrix polymers as the PDA fibers. No color change was seen in pH
values ranging from 0 to 9. The colorimetric response began at pH
11. At high pH values (12–14), the PDA polymer followed a pattern
of the colorimetric response similar to the PDA nanofiber composites.

In comparison between the PDA polymer and the PDA nanofiber composites,
it is important to notice that the colorimetric responses of the PDA
nanofiber composites are higher than those of the PDA polymer at pH
11. The colorimetric response is due to the self-assembled PDA macromolecular
chains, also called “synthetic vesicles”.33 Electrospinning significantly enhanced the formation
of self-assemblies of the PDA macromolecules and then improved the
organization of synthetic vesicles within the nanofibers. Therefore,
the colorimetric response was enhanced in the PDA nanofiber composites.
In addition, the high surface area of the electrospun nanofibers was
able to increase the colorimetric response as well. The results suggested
that the PDA nanofiber composites are good candidates for biosensor
applications.

Conclusion
Two polymers, PEO and
PU, were separately mixed with DA monomers,
and the mixtures were used to create PEO–PDA and PU–PDA
nanofiber composites using an electrospinning method. Smooth and uniform
nanofibers with diameters ranging from 130 nm to 2.5 μm were
obtained at high concentrations and mass ratios. The variation in
the nanofiber morphology was attributed to the mixture solutions and
spinning conditions in electrospinning. Although the PDAs are known
to exhibit colorimetric properties because of external stimuli, to
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report that the PDA
nanofiber composites were able to respond to the presence of E. coli and the change of pH in buffer solutions.
The colorimetric response to E. coli was more pronounced for 6:1 PEO–PDA at 3.75 w/v % concentration
than for 2:1 PEO–PDA at 2 w/v % concentration. The % CR to E. coli was more intense in 6:1 PU–PDA at
25 w/v % concentration than for 6:1 PU–PDA at 18 w/v % concentration.
The results suggest that the increase in the fiber diameter and the
surface area enhanced the colorimetric sensitivity to E. coli. Both the PEO–PDA and PU–PDA
nanofiber composites demonstrated a sensitive colorimetric response
because of the presence of E. coli.
The comparison results show that the combination of PEO and PDA is
favorable in a sensitive response to E. coli. ATR–FTIR analysis confirmed that the colorimetric response
was not caused by a variation of the functional groups within the
polymer. Such results are in accordance with previous reports that
suggest that the color change was induced by a conformational change
in the molecular configuration of PDA when PDA interacted with E. coli. The colorimetric responses of the PDA only,
PEO–PDA, and PU–PDA nanofiber composites were also investigated
in buffer solutions with pH 0–14. Similar responses were found
that the colorimetric response did not occur until pH 10, and then
increased at pH 11, 12, and 13, followed by a slight drop at pH 14.
Our results demonstrate that the PDA-containing nanofiber composites
can be used in developing sensitive, flexible, and lightweight biosensors
that are easy to use, durable, and do not require a power supply.
The potential applications include lab-on-chip sensors, wearable sensors,
and medical sensing textiles such as wound dressing and bandages.

Experimental
Section
10,12-PCDA (98%) was purchased from GFS Organics
(Columbus, OH);
the PCDA monomer was used to synthesize PDAs in electrospinning. PEO
(Mw = 300 000 g/mol) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). PU Tecoflex SG-80A was kindly
donated by Lubrizol Corporation (Brecksville, OH). PEO and PU were
used separately as matrix polymers in nanofiber composites. LB and
chloroform (≥99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). Tetrahydrofuran (THF, 99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Extra Dry, AcroSeal), and
potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Waltham,
MA). LB broth/agar was used as the bacterial growth media. Chloroform,
THF, and DMF were solvents for the preparation of electrospinning
solutions. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was purchased from EMD chemicals
(Gibbstown, NJ, USA). HCl and KOH were used to analyze the polymers
at various pH values. E. coli (Migula)
castellani, and chalmers ATCC25922 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas,
VA). Reagents were used as received without further purification.

PDA Synthesis
The diacetylene monomer, PCDA, was used
in the polymerization of PDAs. PDA polymerized from PCDA was synthesized
following our previously reported procedure.7 Briefly, 2.56 g of PCDA (6.83 mmol) was dissolved in diethyl ether
(35 mL) and filtered to remove any contaminant. Millipore water (18.2
MΩ cm) was added to yield a 1.07 w/v % suspension, which was
sonicated at 65 °C for 30 min. The suspension was allowed to
cool to room temperature, and then stored at 4 °C overnight.
The suspension was transferred to a crystallizing dish with a magnetic
stir bar and irradiated with UV light (254 nm) for 8 min.27 After the photo-polymerization, the dark blue
suspension was transferred to a round bottom flask protected from
light to remove the solvent under vacuum. The solid PDA was then stored
at 4 °C and characterized by ATR–FTIR and UV–vis.

Preparation of Electrospinning Solution
For the preparation
of PDA-containing nanofiber composites, PCDA was mixed with PEO or
PU to prepare electrospinning solutions by varying concentrations
(w/v %) and mass ratios of
PEO to PCDA and PU to PCDA. The mixture solution of PEO and PCDA was
prepared by adding the calculated amount of PEO and PCDA in chloroform,
followed by stirring overnight at room temperature on a hotplate stirrer
at 600 rpm until a homogeneous solution in light pink was obtained.
In mixing PU and PCDA, a binary solvent of 1:1 THF and DMF was used
to prepare uniform solutions. It was attributed to the effect of solvent
properties on the viscosity and surface tension of the solution. DMF
is a dipolar aprotic solvent and has a high dielectric constant (36.7
at 25 °C) and dipole moment (3.8 D) as compared to THF, which
has a low dielectric constant (7.6 at 25 °C) and dipole moment
(1.7 D).28 A 1:1 by volume mixture of these
two solvents achieved a balance of solution viscosity and conductivity,
which was favorable for the formation of PU–PDA nanofibers
via electrospinning. The mixture solution of PU and PCDA was prepared
by dissolving the required amount of PU and PCDA in THF and stirring
the mixture overnight at room temperature. The mixture was then added
to the same volume of DMF and continuously stirred until a uniform
solution in light pink was obtained. The synthetic reaction for PU–PDA
is depicted in Figure S1.

Electrospinning
and PDA Polymerization
A customized
vertical electrospinning apparatus was used to prepare nanofiber composites.
The apparatus primarily consisted of a Gamma High Voltage Research
ES50P power supply, a plastic syringe, a stainless steel needle, a
Harvard PHD 2000 syringe pump, and an aluminum plate type collector.
A mixture solution of PEO and PCDA or PU and PCDA was injected at
0.2 mL/h and 15 kV, and the resulting nanofibers were collected at
a collection distance of 25 cm. The time for electrospinning a solution
was 4 h to obtain a thick and colorless fiber mat. The as-spun fibers
were stored in the dark overnight to avoid any changes due to light
before the photopolymerization of PCDAs. A UV light (Spectroline,
LONGLIFE filter, New York, USA) at 254 nm was used to photopolymerize
PCDAs for 3 min, resulting in PDAs embedded in PEO or PU nanofibers
and creating PEO–PDA or PU–PDA nanofiber composites.
After UV irradiation, the color of the nanofiber composites became
blue within 30 s and then became deep blue within 3 min.

Scanning Electron
Microscopy
The size and morphology
of electrospun nanofibers were studied using an SEM (JEOL, JSM 6500F,
Tokyo, Japan). The fiber mats were kept overnight under vacuum to
evaporate any residual solvent or moisture, followed by sputter-coating
with 10 nm of gold to improve the conductivity of the fiber samples.

FTIR Spectroscopy
ATR–FTIR spectra of PCDA,
PEO–PDA nanofibers, and PU–PDA nanofibers were collected
on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., Madison,
WI) fitted with a Smart iTR ATR sampling accessory and a ZnSe crystal
plate.

Colorimetric Response To pH
The colorimetric response
of PDAs to pH was investigated. The tested PDAs included 100% PDA
powders (PPCDA synthesized in this study) and the PDA composites (PEO–PDA
nanofibers obtained at a 2:1 mass ratio and 3.75% and PU–PDA
nanofibers obtained at a 2:1 mass ratio and 25%). Buffer solutions
were prepared by mixing HCl and KOH, resulting in a range of pH values
from 0 to 14. The PDA polymer and the PEO–PDA and PU–PDA
nanofiber composites were individually dispersed with 1 w/v % in the
buffer solutions. All suspension solutions were stirred for 1 h to
improve uniformity of the solutions. To obtain dry, solid materials,
the solvent was removed using a lyophilizer, and the samples were
analyzed using a Nicolet Evolution 300 UV–vis spectrophotometer
in a diffuse reflectance mode. The colorimetric response (% CR) was
calculated using eq 1 as below.14 1  where the initial percent blue (PB0) is the PB before
the color change, and PB is the final PB after
exposure to external stimuli. The PB value was calculated using eq 2 2  where Ablue is
the absorbance at 648 nm and Ared is the
absorbance at 537 nm.

Bacterial Culture
E. coli (ATCC25922) was streaked on LB agar and was
grown to saturation
at 37 °C for 24 h. One colony was inoculated into LB broth medium
and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm using MaxQ Shaker
for 18 h. An aliquot (100 μL) of the overnight bacterial culture
was spread on LB agar and incubated at 37 °C for 36 h. The E. coli culture was used to test the colorimetric
responses of the obtained nanofiber composites.

Colorimetric
Response To Bacteria
The colorimetric
transition of the nanofiber composites upon direct exposure to E. coli was evaluated using a spectrophotometer (HunterLab
ColorQuest XE) as a function of exposure time (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0,
2.5, and 3.0 h). Electrospun fiber mats were cut into 6.5 cm2 mats. Each 6.5 cm2 fiber mat was then placed flat in
a clear Petri dish where E. coli was
cultured, and the dish was closed and sealed tightly. This setup allowed
bacteria to be in direct contact with the E. coli in the Petri dish. Because the fiber mat was flat on the bottom
of the Petri dish and the Petri dish was clear, it was possible to
conduct spectrophotometer measurements with the appropriate baseline.
The method avoided cross-contamination and allowed the measurements
to be taken in real time, without removing the fiber mat from the
dish. Spectrophotometric measurements were then taken by placing the
Petri dishes on the spectrophotometer measurement outlet while the
fiber mats were still in the Petri dish. The colorimetric reflectance
of the fiber mat was measured every 30 min for 3 h. The outside of
the Petri dishes was wiped and cleaned with ethanol before each spectrophotometric
measurement. For these measurements, three fiber samples obtained
at each electrospinning condition were used in the spectrophotometer.
At each time interval, three spectrophotometric measurements were
conducted for the colorimetric analysis in each fiber mat. An average
of the colorimetric reflectance of each fiber mat was calculated and
used in the analysis of the colorimetric response. The experimental
procedure was also followed for the controls, which included fiber
samples in LB agar only, the supernatant, or the pellet. The LB agar
was pristine and not used for previous bacterial growth. The supernatant
and the pellet were obtained after the solution was centrifuged and
filtered.

A reflectance value was obtained for all fiber mat
samples using the ColorQuest spectrophotometer. Therefore, it was
necessary to convert reflectance to absorbance, so that the colorimetric
response could be calculated using eqs 1 and 2. The absorbance of the
blue and red phases can be calculated based on the reflectance values
using eq 3 as below. 3  

The resulted absorbance value was used
to calculate the colorimetric
response to measure the efficiency of the color change of PDA in the
fibers responding to E. coli. The reflectance
of the blue phase in the spectrophotometer spectrum was measured at
640 nm, and the red reflectance was measured at 540 nm. These reflectance
values were first converted into absorbance and then used to calculate
the colorimetric response that represents the relative change from
blue to red color of PDA before and after exposure to the bacterial
cells.

In summary, Figure 6 shows the experimental design for preparing electrospinning
solutions,
specified concentrations, mass ratios, and tests performed of PEO–PDA
and PU–PDA fibers.
