How
to effectively remove toxic dyes from the industrial wastewater
using a green low-cost lignocellulose-based adsorbent, such as lignin,
has become a topic of great interest but remains quite challenging.
In this study, cosolvent-enhanced lignocellulosic fractionation (CELF)
pretreatment and Mannich reaction were combined to generate an aminated
CELF lignin which is subsequently applied for removal of methylene
blue and direct blue (DB) 1 dye from aqueous solution. 31P NMR was used to track the degree of amination, and an orthogonal
design was applied to determine the relationship between the extent
of amination and reaction parameters. The physicochemical, morphological,
and thermal properties of the aminated CELF lignin were characterized
to confirm the successful grafting of diethylenetriamine onto the
lignin. The aminated CELF lignin proved to be an effective azo dye-adsorbent,
demonstrating considerably enhanced dye decolorization, especially
toward DB 1 dye (>90%). It had a maximum adsorption capacity of
DB
1 dye of 502.7 mg/g, and the kinetic study suggested the adsorption
process conformed to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The isotherm
results also showed that the modified lignin-based adsorbent exhibited
monolayer adsorption. The adsorbent properties were mainly attributed
to the incorporated amine functionalities as well as the increased
specific surface area of the aminated CELF lignin.

Introduction
The demand for clean
water is likely to increase driven by the
rapid urbanization, expanding industrial activities, energy generation,
and water pollution. Because of the limited fresh water resources
on earth, this demand should be addressed by developing promising
water purification techniques. The presence of organic dyes in industrial
wastewater could cause some serious environmental concerns because
of their poor biodegradability and toxicity to the exposed plants,
living organisms, and even human being. As a result, these toxic dyes
should be removed from the wastewater as much as possible before being
discharged to land or water sources in an environmentally friendly
manner.1 The textile industry consumes
organic dyes, which represent 60% of the world’s dye consumption,
and it was reported that 10–25% of water-soluble dyes is lost
during the dyeing process, and 2–20% of dyes is released as
the effluent into the water system after the dyeing process.2 Azo dyes are known as dyes containing −N=N–
groups, representing 60–70% of commercially available dyes
in the world.3 They are extensively used
in the textile industry and become part of the textile effluents.
Therefore, how to cost-effectively remove these toxic azo dyes from
the industrial wastewater has become a topic of great interest. Adsorption
is considered as an alternative method to the traditional combination
of chemical and biological processes for the removal of dyes from
aqueous solutions.4,5 Dye adsorption by various adsorbents
is considered to occur primarily via π interaction, hydrogen
bonding, and electrostatic interactions. Several organic and inorganic
materials including zeolite,2,6 lignocellulosic substrate,7,8 activated carbon,9 graphite,10 and graphene oxide have been all tested and
shown to have different adsorption activities toward organic dyes
in wastewater.11,12 Some of these adsorbents have
a rather high dye-removal efficiency; however, low-cost renewable
green bioadsorbents are still rare for this field of application,
and further studies are urgently required.13

The biorefinery concept has received considerable attention
in
the last decade because of advances in biotechnology and genetic engineering,
offering a renewable and sustainable alternative to the production
of common petrochemicals.14 Abundant lignocellulosic
biomass is a second-generation nonfood feedstock that, when used by
future biorefineries, has the potential to significantly offset the
carbon footprint of the traditional refining.15 As one of the most important renewable fractions found in biomass,
lignin is still significantly underutilized in the current biorefinery
industries, which has mainly focused on transforming biomass carbohydrates
to liquid fuels.16 It is anticipated that
with the growing demand of biomass for production of fuels, the production
of lignin would also substantially increase, potentially serving as
a versatile platform for the production of biopolymers and renewable
high-performance materials. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) established
in 2005 and further expanded in 2007 by the Energy Independence and
Security Act (EISA) aims to ascend to 36 billion gallons of renewable
fuel in 2022. Assuming a yield of 335 L per dry Mg of biomass, 223
million Mg of biomass will be used annually, producing about 62 million
Mg of lignin.17 To avoid using lignin as
a low-grade boiler fuel, new thermal and chemical processes are needed
to generate value-added products from lignin.

A lignin macromolecule
contains various amounts of functional groups
including carbonyl, methoxy, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups, which
offers promising opportunities to take advantage of its versatile
functionality for multiple applications.18 Without any further chemical treatments, lignin could be directly
incorporated into a polymeric matrix to be served as an antioxidant,19 a flame retardant,20 dye adsorbent,21,22 and a UV stabilizer.23 Given the diversity of lignin, variability in
performance as a functionalized polymer is expected to depend on the
plant sources, lignin isolation methods, and physicochemical structures
of lignin. Thus, chemical modifications of lignin to improve its valorization
have attracted growing attention.24,25 Lignin amination
refers to a process that introduces an amine group into the lignin
structure. One of the bases of lignin amination is the Mannich reaction
that refers to the reaction between the lignin and amine in the presence
of formaldehyde. The obtained aminated lignin has properties that
make it ideal for use in several applications, including surfactants,26 dispersants,27 heavy
metal adsorbents,28 and asphalt emulsifiers.29,30 Because of its aromatic/phenolic nature and cationic side chain,
the aminated lignin could have great potential as a low-cost bioadsorbent
for the removal of organic dyes especially azo dyes that are typically
anionic in charge in wastewater.

Here, we used a cosolvent enhanced
lignocellulosic fractionation
(CELF) method as a highly effective lignin-first pretreatment approach
that is capable of extracting highly pure technical-grade lignin from
corn stover. CELF applies aqueous mixture of tetrahydrofuran (THF)
and dilute acid to greatly enhance the fractionation of lignin, hemicellulose,
and cellulose fractions in biomass while promoting lignin fragmentation
by limiting certain lignin condensation reactions typically suffered
at high reaction severities. The obtained CELF lignin is depolymerized,
containing lower aryl ether linkages and higher phenolic hydroxyl
groups than the typical native milled wood lignin, cellulolytic enzyme
lignin, or kraft lignin, which favors the subsequent amination process.31,32 The isolated CELF lignin was then aminated by diethylenetriamine
(DETA) in the presence of formaldehyde under acid conditions via the
Mannich reaction. An orthogonal array system was also applied to test
the optimal conditions for the Mannich reaction. The obtained final
aminated lignin was thoroughly characterized by various analytical
techniques including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area analysis. Finally, the performance of the obtained
aminated CELF lignin as a biorenewable adsorbent for the removal of
methylene blue (MB) and direct blue (DB) dyes was evaluated and compared
to other reported adsorbents from literature. The combinatorial process
takes advantage of the selectivity of the Mannich chemistry and the
unique versatile functionality of CELF lignin such as low ether linkages
and high phenolic OH content. It is fully expected that this study
will provide a baseline for future studies to synthesize a renewable
lignin-based dye adsorbent in advanced wastewater treatment systems.

Synthesis and Characterization of Adsorbents
Orthogonal
Experiments
Systematic experimental designs
such as response surface methodology and orthogonal arrays are widely
used to obtain the optimal response.33,34 An orthogonal
experiment design (L16, 54) including five factors (A:
temperature, B: time, C: amine content, D: formaldehyde content, and
E: acetic acid content) at four different levels was first applied
to determine the optimal Mannich reaction conditions. The Mannich
reaction can only occur between a high electron density carbon and
an immonium ion formed from formaldehyde and an amine, thus the amine
groups are expected to be introduced only at the ortho or para position
of a phenolic hydroxyl group, converting H or G types of free phenolic
hydroxyl group (or both) to C5 substituted hydroxyl groups
(Figure 1).35 This provides a unique opportunity to determine
the extent of lignin amination by tracking the content of free H and
G phenolic hydroxyl groups. Quantitative 31P NMR technique
was used to track the content of free H and G phenolic hydroxyl groups,
aiming to assess the extent of lignin amination. Table 1 shows the conversion of H and
G types of free phenolic hydroxyl for each experiment of the designed
orthogonal array. As indicated by Table 1, the effect of each experiment parameter
on the extent of lignin amination increases in this order: acetic
acid content (E) < reaction time (B) < DETA content (C) <
formaldehyde content (D) < reaction temperature (A), according
to the extremum of each factor (R value). The reaction
temperature was found to be the most important factor, and the extent
of amination appears to achieve its maximum at 75 °C. This could
be because the Mannich reaction is an endothermic reaction thus it
can be promoted by increasing the temperature. A further increase
in temperature has been shown to have a negative effect on animation,
which could be because of unnecessary formaldehyde and DETA evaporation,
thus resulting in a decrease of reaction efficiency.36 In conclusion, the optimal combination parameters of the
experiment are 75 °C, 4 h, 4 mmol DETA, 16 mmol formaldehyde,
and 0.20 mL acetic acid, according to the average values of each factor
at different levels (K value). A large scale batch
reaction was then performed at this optimal condition, and the obtained
aminated CELF lignin was subsequently characterized by several state-of-the-art
analytical techniques.

FTIR Analysis
The structural characteristics of the
CELF lignin and aminated lignin were analyzed by FTIR as shown in Figure 2. Results showed
that the aminated CELF lignin exhibited some basic adsorption peaks
of CELF lignin, which indicates that the skeleton structure of lignin
remains basically intact during the Mannich reaction. For example,
hydroxyl group stretch (3400 cm–1), asymmetrical
stretching vibrations of −CH3 and −CH2– (2937 cm–1), and symmetrical stretching
vibrations of −CH3 and −CH2–
(2844 cm–1) are observed in both lignin samples.
Nonetheless, there exist obvious differences between the lignin and
aminated lignin samples. For example, the intensity of FTIR peaks
associated with the aromatic C–H vibrations including 1603
and 1512 cm–1 from the aminated lignin is significantly
lower than that from the original CELF lignin. This is because the
Mannich reaction mainly occurred in the aromatic region of lignin.37 In addition, the intensity of FTIR peaks associated
with G units including 1267 cm–1 (C–O stretch),
1113 cm–1 (deformation vibrations of C–H),
and 1030 cm–1 (aromatic C–H in-plane deformation)
and H units such as 1164 cm–1 (C–O stretch)
is decreased after amination reaction.38 On the other hand, the intensity of syringyl C–O stretch
(1325 cm–1) remains relatively strong after Mannich
reaction.38 This is because the amine group
could be only introduced at the C3 or C5 position
of H lignin and the C5 position of the G units. Finally,
a strong peak around 1650 cm–1 representing the
N–H bending vibrations in the amine structure (NH2) appeared in the aminated lignin, validating the successful addition
of the amine.39 The peak of carbonyl group
around 1680 cm–1 also disappears after Mannich reaction
possibly because of the reaction between C=O and primary amines
to form imine derivatives known as Schiff bases.40

2D HSQC Analysis
Two-dimensional
HSQC NMR has been
comprehensively used in lignin characterization because of its versatility
in offering structural insight into the lignin subunits and interlinkages.41 The reaction mechanism of Mannich reaction and
the chemical structural transformation of CELF lignin during the amination
reaction was further characterized by 2D HSQC NMR in this study. As
shown in Figure 3,
the CELF lignin possesses typical structural aromatic patterns of
corn stover lignin. Peaks related to S, G, H, p-coumaric
acid (pCA), ferulic acid (FA), and tricin (T) are
all well defined in the aromatic region.42 Condensed S and G signals were also found in the CELF lignin, which
are commonly observed from the lignin isolated by cosolvent pretreatment
at temperature conditions of 180 °C or higher with acid.43−45 However, there exist dramatic differences between the original CELF
lignin and modified lignin in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions.
Specifically, it was found that the cross peaks associated with G
and H lignin units were significantly altered during the Mannich reaction,
while the signal of the S lignin units remained relatively stable.
In addition, there are two Mannich reactive sites in tricin namely
T6 and T8, which also disappeared in the aminated
lignin because of the reaction of DETA and formaldehyde at these activate
aromatic sites. Several intense signals were observed in the CELF
lignin at δC/δH 178/9.5–9.6
ppm and δC/δH 123/7.5 ppm, representing
the aldehyde (Cα) and furanic C–H (C3) signals of the five-substituted furfural derivatives, respectively.41 It has been reported that these types of furfural
derivatives such as 5-hydroxymethyfurfural or 5-(methoxymethyl)furfural,
which arose from sugar dehydration reactions could be condensed with
the lignin structure during the acid catalyzed organosolv pretreatments.46 These types of structure were absent after the
Mannich reaction possibly because of the reaction between aldehydes
and primary amines to form Schiff bases.40

analysis of the original CELF lignin and its aminated product.
(A) CELF lignin aromatic region; (B) aminated lignin aromatic region;
(C) CELF lignin aliphatic region; (D) aminated lignin aliphatic region.

In the aliphatic region, lignin interlinkages especially
the β–O–4
linkages were dramatically cleaved during the CELF pretreatment process,
and in fact, these linkages could be only detected at a noise level
(data not shown). This is consistent with previous studies that reported
CELF pretreatment performed at high severities (180 °C) was capable
of achieving near-complete removal of its native β-aryl ether
linkages without hydrogen input or further heterogeneous catalytic
processing.31,47 This process is expected to generate
a substantial amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups that favor the subsequent
amination process. The methoxyl group remains as the pronounced functional
group in both lignin spectra. Compared to the unmodified CELF lignin,
a significant amount of new signals appeared in the phenolic lignin
side chain of aminated lignin, which was mainly ascribed to the methylene
bridge of DETA introduced during the Mannich reaction. Our HSQC analysis
also reveals that both the primary and secondary amines are capable
of activating the formaldehyde. As shown in Figure 3, there still exist plenty of secondary amines
in our proposed aminated lignin structure, which means that as new
formaldehyde is activated by these protons, additional reactive phenolic
G and H units could be subsequently grafted onto these partially aminated
lignins until all the protons on the N atoms are replaced. A schematic
diagram of Mannich reaction and the structural transformation of CELF
lignin during the amination reaction is shown in Figure S3. The unmodified and aminated lignin was also subjected
to a qualitatively visual ninhydrin test (Figure S4). The original CELF lignin had a negative/orange color indicating
the absence of amines, while the change of color in the aminated lignin
proved the existence of primary and secondary amine groups.

31P NMR Analysis
Quantitative 31P NMR technique
was further employed to determine different types
of hydroxyl groups including aliphatic, phenolic, and carboxylic acid
in the CELF lignin and aminated lignin, and the results are shown
in Figure 4. The phosphitylation
reaction of various OHs in lignin structural units with TMDP is shown
in Figure S5. According to a recent study,
the S hydroxyl group and condensed G hydroxyl groups are not fully
baseline resolved and therefore are combined into C5 substituted
hydroxyl groups in this study to avoid any possible overestimation
of S and underestimation of the G condensed unit.48 As compared to the original CELF lignin, a noticeable decrease
in phenolic G and H hydroxyl groups was observed in the aminated CELF
lignin after Mannich reaction. By contrast, the content of phenolic
C5 substituted hydroxyl groups including the S and condensed
G and H units were considerably higher in the modified lignin than
that in the original CELF lignin. The 31P results also
indicated that the reactivity of the reaction sites in G lignin units
was higher than that in the H lignin, and as a result, the proportion
of the G unit decreased more obviously than the H unit. The slight
loss of aliphatic hydroxyl group may result from the possible loss
of hydrophilic lignin fragment during the dialysis of aminated lignin.

and (B) aminated lignin.

SEM Analysis
The
modified lignin sample was obtained
by rotatory evaporation and centrifugation followed by extended dialysis
and freeze-drying. After repeated vacuum evaporation and centrifugation,
the formation of a turbid suspension suggested the possible presence
of aminated lignin nanoparticles. The morphological changes of CELF
lignin during Mannich reaction are monitored by SEM and displayed
in Figure 5. The unmodified
CELF lignin in the solid state has a much larger particle size compared
to the aminated lignin and appears granulated with irregular grains
of compact structure. The surface of aminated lignin is much smoother
than that of the original lignin. The nanospheric particles also aggregated
into a micron-sized cluster with undefined shapes in the aminated
lignin, which were possibly induced by the freeze-drying process.49

Mag. = 5k; (B,E): Mag. = 10k; (C,F): Mag. = 20k.

Thermal Gravimetric Analysis
The first derivative of
the thermogravimetric (DTG) curves of the original CELF lignin and
its aminated products exhibited different thermal degradation stages
in N2 (Figure 6). Overall, the aminated CELF lignin degraded faster than
the unmodified lignin. In the pyrolysis range (200–600 °C),
the DTG curve for the CELF lignin exhibits a single decomposition
step with a decomposition peak temperature of 395 °C, while the
curve for the aminated CELF lignin exhibits two composition steps,
which are around 243 and 317 °C. The decomposition step above
300 °C is probably because of the cleavage of the C–C
linkages and the demethoxylation of aromatic ring.37,50 The lower degradation temperature for aminated lignin is probably
because of the lower C–N bond energy compared to the C–C
bond. The decomposition step around 243 °C could be because of
the degradation and evaporation of small molecular weight lignin fragments
such as aliphatic side chains. The final degradation step around 600
°C is probably because of the crack of C–C/H bond of the
charcoal that was formed during the pyrolysis.51

lignin.

BET Surface Area Analysis
Table 2 summarizes
the BET specific surface areas
(SBET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore volumes (VBJH) of the lignins
before and after amination. Results indicated that the aminated lignin
exhibited higher SBET and VBJH than those of the original CELF lignin. For example,
the SBET values were 4.2 and 5.9 m2/g for the CELF lignin and aminated lignin, respectively.
In addition, the mesoporosity of these lignin samples is also confirmed
by the pore size distribution analysis (Figure S6). Because the aminated lignin had a larger surface area,
it provided more adsorption sites, and hence enhanced dye removal
can be anticipated.

Removal of Dye by the Adsorbent
To demonstrate the
potential dye-adsorption property of the modified CELF lignin, two
types of dyes were tested in the lignin-dye adsorption experiment:
a cationic dye MB and an anionic azo dye DB 1. The qualitative and
quantitative effect of lignin loading on the dye decolorization efficiency
for the original and aminated lignin is shown in Figure 7. These results indicated that
the aminated lignin showed drastically improved decolorization efficiency
for both dyes especially the anionic DB 1 dye. For example, the amination
process increased the DB 1 dye-removal efficiency from <5 to >90%
even at extremely low lignin loadings. The decolorization efficiency
for MB dye is proportional to the dose of lignin, while no correlation
could be obtained between the efficiency of DB 1 dye removal and the
concentration of lignin. This might be attributed to the unmodified
lignin inability to adsorb DB 1 dye even at extremely high lignin
dose and the aminated lignin strong ability to adsorb DB 1 dye even
at low lignin loadings. The effect of amino content on the adsorptivity
of the aminated CELF lignin was further investigated, and the results
indicated that the dye decolorization efficiency was positively correlated
to the amino content of the modified CELF lignin (Figure S7). The modified lignin has much higher decolorization
efficiency toward the anionic dye (DB 1) compared to the cationic
dye (MB). This could be mainly because of the electrostatic coupling
between the cationic side chain (amine group) of the aminated lignin
and the anionic sites of the DB 1 dye.52 It is well known that pH affects the adsorption of most organic
pollutants as well as the surface charges of adsorbents. To further
confirm that electrostatic interactions are key mechanism of adsorptive
removal of dyes in DB 1 dye in aqueous solutions, the effect of initial
pH on the dye decolorization efficiency and zeta potential of aminated
CELF lignin was evaluated within the pH range of ∼4.0 and 10.0
(Figure 8). At extreme
acidic or basic conditions (pH < 3 or > 12), lignin samples
were
found to be partially or completely dissolved in aqueous solutions,
thus their adsorption and surface charge behaviors were not investigated
at these conditions. These results also indicated that high pH values
resulted in a decrease in the adsorptivity of aminated CELF lignin,
which could be because of the increase of the magnitude of the negative
zeta potential as pH increases. The aminated CELF lignin has a point
of zero charge (pHPZC) around 4.5, and its magnitude of
zeta potential at each tested pH value (−2 to −25 mV)
is significantly lower than that of the unmodified CELF lignin ranging
from −68 to −75 mV (Figure 8). This is because of the addition of the
cationic amine group onto the side chain of aminated lignin. DB 1
dye has four sulfonate groups, thus it remains negatively charged
at basic conditions and even at highly acidic solutions as these protonated
sulfonate groups have a pKa value lower
than zero.53 Therefore, the increase of
the net negative zeta potential could further cause a decrease of
the electrostatic interactions between the cationic lignin side chain
and the negatively charged DB 1 dye in aqueous solution. This suggests
that electrostatic force is a major interaction for DB 1 dye adsorption
at lower pH. Furthermore, the decolorization efficiency is still above
60% even at high pH, although there exists substantial electrostatic
repulsion between the modified lignin and DB 1 dye. This indicates
that mechanisms other than electrostatic interaction such as hydrogen
bonding and π–π stacking are also operative for
the DB 1 dye adsorption on the aminated CELF lignin.54 On the other hand, hydrogen bonding, π-interaction,
and limited electrostatic interaction between lignin dissociated carboxyl/hydroxyl
groups and the cationic sites of the dye molecule are believed to
be responsible for the MB dye adsorption.1Figure 9 shows a
proposed scheme for the MB and DB 1 dye binding to the unmodified
CELF lignin and aminated lignin surface.

The Langmuir and Freundlich
model was used to study the adsorption
isotherms of azo-dyes, and their equations (eqs 1 and 2) are shown below 1   2  where ce (mg/mL)
is the equilibrium concentration, Qe (mg/g)
is the equilibrium adsorption capacity, Qm (mg/g) is the maximum adsorption capacity of the Langmuir isotherm
model, KL (mL/mg) is a Langmuir adsorption
coefficient, KF (mL/mg) is the Freundlich
constant, and 1/n is an indicator that reflects the
nonlinear degree of adsorption. Figure 10 shows the Langmuir (A) and Freundlich (C)
adsorption isotherms curves, and the linear analysis (B and D) indicated
that the observed dye adsorption data for aminated CELF lignin were
better described by the Langmuir isotherm model as confirmed by the
higher coefficient R2. The Langmuir fitting
results suggested that the adsorption process between the lignin and
the azo dye could be characterized as a monolayer type of adsorption.
The Langmuir isotherm analysis indicated that the maximum adsorption
capacity of the aminated CELF lignin is 502.7 mg/g for DB 1 dye. A
direct comparison of the maximum adsorption capacities of different
anionic azo dyes on various previously reported adsorbents is presented
in Table 3. Based on
our literature survey, it was found that the adsorption capacity of
aminated CELF lignin is higher than that of all other adsorbents except
carbon nanospheres. It should be noted that these adsorbents include
commercial activated carbon, anion exchange membrane, and multiwalled
carbon nanotubes, which are all well-known for their high aspect ratio,
natural porosity, and strong ability to adsorb pollutants from the
aqueous system. This suggests that the aminated CELF lignin, as a
low-cost renewable resource, is highly suitable for the removal of
azo-dyes from the aqueous solutions.

The rate of the adsorption
process is an important factor that
determines if the sorbent could be used on large scales in industrial
applications and it can be determined by kinetic studies. In the study
of solid–liquid static adsorption kinetics, the relationship
between the time and the amount of adsorption is typically fitted
through dynamic models.64 Two mathematical
models are usually adapted to analyze the dynamic models of adsorption
process, namely pseudo-first-order (eq 3) and pseudo-second-order (eq 4) equation 3   4  where Qe and Qt are adsorption capacity (mg/g)
at equilibrium time and any instant of adsorption time t (min) and K1 and K2 are the rate constant of the pseudo-first-order and second-order
adsorption, respectively. The study about the effect of time on the
adsorption process, as shown in Figure S8, suggests that the amount of dye adsorbed by the adsorbent increases
rapidly at the beginning for 30 min, and then the adsorption efficiency
becomes slow for 240 min until the adsorption equilibrium is reached.
The pseudo first and second kinetic models assume that the adsorption
process is governed by diffusion and chemical adsorption mechanism,
respectively. The observed experimental data were fitted to the pseudo-first-order
and second-order equations, and their linear fitted plots and the
parameters of the kinetic model are shown in Figure 11 and Table 4, respectively. It was found that the correlation coefficient
(R2) of pseudo-second-order equation kinetic
model was higher than that of the pseudo-first-order model, suggesting
that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model may be more suitable for
describing the kinetics of the adsorption process of the DB 1 dye
on the aminated CELF lignin. This suggested that the adsorption behaviors
of azo-dye onto the modified lignin are dominated by chemical adsorption
instead of diffusion process. It has been reported that the adsorption
process is generally divided into three main stages, including the
film diffusion stage, intraparticle diffusion stage, and the final
actual adsorption stage.65 To further test
if the intraparticle diffusion is the only rate determining step of
the adsorption process, the intraparticle diffusion kinetic model
is also fitted with the experimental data (Figure S9), and results indicated that the adsorption process has
more than one speed-controlling step. In addition, the relatively
large boundary layer thickness as reflected by the large intercept
of the linear plot (t1/2 vs qt) suggests that membrane diffusion might
also have a great effect on the adsorption process.65

Reusability of the adsorbent
represents an important aspect to
minimize the cost of the overall adsorption process. The recycle performances
of aminated CELF lignin for DB 1 dye removal were also investigated
in this study. The results, as shown in Figure 12, show that no significant reduction in
the adsorption efficiency is found for three cycles compared with
that of the fresh adsorbent, although there is a gradual decrease
in the dye-removal efficiencies possibly because of the incomplete
of dye desorption. The dye-removal efficiency decreased to 65% for
the fourth use, probably because of the saturation of the adsorbent
surface. Thus, the recycle study demonstrated that the aminated CLEF
lignin remained as an efficient adsorbent even after multiple reuses.

four adsorption–desorption cycles.

Aminated CELF Lignin Characterization after Dye Adsorption
The FTIR spectra of aminated CELF lignin before and after dye adsorption
are shown in Figure S10. After adsorption,
two additional peaks at around 1200 and 1035 cm–1 representing the stretching vibration bands of the sulfonate group
appear in the aminated lignin because of the attachment of the DB
1 dye. The N=N stretching vibration from DB 1 dye is unclear
in the IR spectra because the direct dye is a symmetrical trans azo
compound. SEM was also used to analyze the morphology of the aminated
CELF lignin surface after the adsorption of DB 1 dye (Figure 13). Results showed that the
shape of lignin particles did not change dramatically and remained
as an aggregated cluster with irregular shapes and heterogeneous surface,
but their size appeared to increase significantly after dye adsorption.
These observations clearly revealed that the DB 1 dye is adsorbed
on the surface of the modified CELF lignin.

Conclusions
Development of low-cost
renewable bioadsorbents for removal of
toxic dyes from contaminated water has been a topic of great interest
but remains challenging. In this study, the aminated corn stover lignin
was synthesized via combinatorial CELF pretreatment and Mannich reaction
to remove azo dyes from aqueous solutions. Under acid conditions,
both the primary and secondary amines have high reactivity toward
the H3/5 and G5 position of CELF lignin. SEM
revealed that the original lignin particles are distributed in a large
conglomerate, while the surface of aminated lignin becomes smoother,
and the nanospherical particles of the modified lignin aggregate into
nano- and micron-sized cluster with undefined shapes. The combination
of CELF pretreatment and Mannich reaction significantly increased
the adsorption behavior of aminated lignin toward azo DB 1 dye with
a maximum capacity of 502.7 mg/g, which is significantly higher than
that of many adsorbent materials reported in the literature. Recycle
studied suggested that once recovered, the bioadsorbent was capable
of maintaining a relatively high dye removal efficiency (>85%)
even
after three recycles. In conclusion, the proposed aminated CELF lignin
could be considered as a cost-effective bioadsorptive platform for
the efficient removal of azo dyes from aqueous solutions.

Experimental
Section
Feedstocks and Chemicals
The Kramer corn stover was
provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL, Golden,
CO). The corn stover was knife-milled to pass through a 1 mm particle
size interior sieve using a laboratory mill (model 4, Arthur H. Thomas
Company, Philadelphia, PA). All the chemicals used in this study were
used as received from Sigma-Aldrich without any further purification.

Production of the CELF Lignin
CELF pretreatment of
corn stover was performed in a custom built 1 L Hastelloy Parr reactor
(Parr instruments Company, Moline, IL) at 7.5 wt % solids loading
and 0.5 wt % H2SO4 acid loading. The CELF reaction
was sustained at 180 °C for 25 min in an equivolume mixture of
THF and water. After pretreatment, the reactor was quenched in a 25
°C water bath, and the liquid phase was separated from the pretreated
solids through vacuum paper filtration. The CELF lignin was then isolated
from the liquid phase by first neutralization with ammonium hydroxide
followed by THF evaporation and subsequent vacuum filtration of the
precipitated lignin from the neutralized liquor. The obtained CELF
lignin was washed with water and diethyl ether and dried at 45 °C
in an incubator. Once dried, the lignin was finally crushed to a fine
powder in a mortar and pestle and stored in a container prior to further
test and modification.

Amination of the CELF Lignin
The
corn stover CELF lignin
(∼200 mg) was mixed with 2 mL of dioxane in a round flask under
constant stirring for 20 min at room temperature until the lignin
was fully dissolved. Specified amounts of DETA, acetic acid, and formaldehyde
were then added into the solution with continuous stirring. Formaldehyde
was added stepwise to avoid unnecessary crosslinking reactions. Subsequently,
the flask was heated in a sand bath, kept at a specified temperature
(45, 60, 75, and 90 °C), and stirred for a specified time (1,
2, 3, and 4 h). Afterward, the reaction mixture was evaporated under
reduced pressure to remove the majority of the organic solvent followed
by dialysis with a molecular weight cut off of 1000 Da. The obtained
aminated CELF lignin was finally freeze-dried and stored at room temperature
before further characterization.

Lignin Characterization
before and after Amination
FTIR Analysis
The IR spectra were
collected using a
Spectrum One FTIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA) equipped
with a diamond-composite attenuated total reflectance cell from 1000
to 4000 cm–1 with 128 scans at 4 cm–1 resolutions.

NMR Analysis
NMR experiments were
acquired with a Bruker
Avance III HD 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm N2 cryogenically cooled BBO H&F probe, according to previously
published literatures.32,66 A standard Bruker pulse sequence
(hsqcetgpspsi2.2) and an inverse-gated decoupling pulse sequence (Waltz-16)
were applied for HSQC and 31P NMR experiment, respectively.

SEM Analysis
The morphology of lignin samples was observed
with a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Auriga, Germany) at an
accelerating voltage of 5 kV. The samples were sputter-coated with
Au using an SPI-Module sputter coater for 50 s. Imaging was subsequently
captured at various magnifications from 2k to 20k.

Thermal Gravimetric
Analysis
The TGA was performed
by a TGA Q50 thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TA instruments, UDA). Lignin
samples (∼5 mg) were loaded to a platinum sample pan (TA instruments)
and heated in nitrogen from 25 to 105 °C at 20 °C/min. After
incubating at 105 °C for 10 min, it was heated further from 105
to 800 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min.

Zeta Potential
Analysis
The zeta potential of lignin
suspensions was measured at different hydrogen ion concentrations
while keeping a concentration of 1 mg/mL, using ZetaPALS (Brookhaven
Instruments Corporation, NY). The mean zeta potential of each suspension
was calculated from 10 measurements.

Surface Area and Pore Size
Analysis
The N2 adsorption–desorption measurement
of samples was carried
out at 77 K on a Quantachrome Autosorb iQ. The samples were first
degassed at 353 K for ∼17 h before being loaded into the analysis
station. The pore volume and pore size distribution were determined
using a BJH method. The specific surface area was calculated using
BET in the P/P0 range
of 0.05–0.30.

Dye Decolorization Study
Various
amounts of CELF lignin
and aminated lignin were mixed with 25 mL of MB or DB 1 dye solution
with a concentration of 50 mg/L. The mixture was left in an incubator
at 25 °C and 150 rpm for 24 h. The concentration of dye in the
supernatant of the solution at the equilibrium was determined by a
UV spectrophotometer. The amount of dye adsorbed (qe) by lignin substrates was calculated based on the following eq 5 5  where co and ce represent
the initial and equilibrium concentrations
of dye solution (mg/L), respectively, v is the volume
of the total solution (mL), and m is the dry weight
of the lignin sample (g). The maximum wavelength for MB and DB 1 dye
was set at 663 and 624 nm, respectively. The extinction coefficient
of MB and DB 1 dye was determined to be 149.3 and 12.3 L mol–1 cm–1 based on the Beer’s law calibration
(Figures S1 and S2). The decolorization
efficiency (η) is defined by 6  where co represents
the initial concentration, and c is the concentration
of dye in the supernatant after decolorization. The adsorption isotherms
of DB 1 dye onto aminated lignin were measured with varying concentrations
of dye ranging from 0.05 to 1 mg/mL at 25 °C. To further investigate
the kinetics of dye adsorption, the equilibrium concentrations of
dye solution were measured from 5 min to 8 h after mixing 20 mg of
aminated lignin with 40 mL of DB 1 with an initial concentration of
1 mg/mL. The effect of initial pH on dye adsorption was studied by
mixing ∼10 mg of lignin with 25 mL of initial DB 1 dye with
a concentration of 50 mg/mL at 25 °C. ∼0.1 M HNO3 and 0.01 M of NaOH were used to adjust the pH between 4 and 10.
For the recycling experiment, dilute NaOH (pH = 10) was used to release
the adsorbed dye from the adsorbent. The adsorption of the dye by
the regenerated lignin was repeated four times by mixing ∼20
mg of solid with 25 mL of MB or DB 1 dye solution with a concentration
of 50 mg/L.
