Four
pyrrole B-ring-functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs
and their B-ring unsubstituted analogues were synthesized
from easily accessible starting 5-halo-2-formylpyrroles and were characterized
by nuclear magnetic resonance, high-resolution mass spectrometry,
X-ray analysis, and optical/electronic properties. In great contrast
to the substitution(s) at the other two pyrrolic units, electron-donating
substituent(s) at pyrrole B-ring bring significant blue
shift of the absorption and emission bands. Cyclic voltammetry and
density functional theory calculations indicate that this blue shift
may be attributed to the increased highest occupied molecular orbital
and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels and the
overall increase in the energy band gaps. These pyrrolylBODIPYs generally
show intense absorption (centered at 570–624 nm) and fluorescence
emission (582–654 nm) in nonpolar solvents. A gradual decrease
in the fluorescence intensity was observed for these dyes with the
increase in solvent dipolar moment, which combines with the red to
far-red absorption/emission, rendering these pyrrolylBODIPYs potential
applications as environment-sensitive fluorescence probes as demonstrated
in this work for bovine serum albumin.

Introduction
Polarity-responsive
fluorescent dyes have attracted wide research
interests in biology and medicine research areas, as fluorescent probes
for the monitoring of a variety of biological and biochemical processes
or as “smart” imaging and therapeutic agents because
the type of fluorescent dyes generally can be activated by the hydrophobicity
of a specific microenvironment.1 For example,
probes such as 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid and thioflavin
T generally exhibit low fluorescence in aqueous solution but become
highly fluorescent in nonpolar solution,2 whereas Prodan and Nile red exhibit emission at longer wavelength
in aqueous solution but at shorter wavelength in nonpolar solution.
Nagano and co-workers reported a novel environment-sensitive BODIPY
(boron dipyrromethene) probe library in which the fluorescence properties
are well-controlled through different meso-aryl groups.2a However, these BODIPYs and many other reported
probes often absorb and emit at shorter wavelength (less than 550
nm). Development of environment-sensitive fluorescence probes absorbing
and emitting in the far-red to the NIR region is highly desirable.

BODIPYs (Figure 1a)3−5 have attracted wide research interests in a variety of research
fields, for example, as laser dyes,6 fluorescent
sensors,7 fluorescent switches,8 fluorescence labeling,9 and photosensitizers,10,11 owing to their tunable
outstanding photophysical properties, including high absorption coefficients,
intense fluorescence, and rich chemistry, which render the facile
functionalization and modification of the chromophore. Installation
of the pyrrole unit at the α-position of the chromophore to
form the so-called pyrrolylBODIPY (Figure 1a) is an efficient way to extend the π-conjugation
of the chromophore and brings the desired red shift of the spectra.
For example, BODIPY 576/589 as a commercialized long-wavelength fluorescent
pyrrolylBODIPY derivative has been widely applied for bioimaging.12,13

and the commercial pyrrolylBODIPY 576/589 marketed by Invitrogen;
(b) our recently reported synthetic strategies to pyrrolic unsubstituted
or halogenated pyrrolylBODIPYs I and II;
and (c) our lately developed synthetic strategies to A- and C-ring alkyl-substituted isoindoleBODIPYs III and the concept of our synthesis of A-, B-, C-ring alkyl-substituted pyrrolylBODIPYs 4 presented in this work.

As part of our continuous research efforts toward long-wavelength
BODIPY dyes, our group and Ravikanth et al. have recently developed
a set of facile synthetic routes toward pyrrolylBODIPY chromophores
to address the synthetic difficulties of this type of chromophore
(Figure 1b,c).14−21 For example, we have synthesized pyrrolic unsubstituted pyrrolylBODIPY I from the oxidative addition of pyrrole to pyrrolic-free meso-arylBODIPYs15 or the “one-pot”
condensation of acyl chloride16 and the
halogenated pyrrolylBODIPY II from the aromatic substitution
of the α-haloBODIPY with pyrrole17−19 (Figure 1b). However, all of those pyrrolylBODIPYs
did not have substituents on the pyrrolic rings, and most of them
showed few variations in the fluorescence intensities in different
solvents upon changing the polarity.

Our group lately has developed
a facile synthetic route to pyrrolic
alkyl-substituted isoindoleBODIPY III from a condensation
of 3-halo-1-formylisoindole with excess amounts of pyrrole.20,21 This synthetic route allows the installation of various substituents
at both A and C pyrrolic units of the chromophore
via simple variation in the starting pyrrole derivatives. Installation
of alkyl substituents at these two pyrrolic units of the chromophore
brings a dramatic red shift of the spectra.21

In great contrast to 3-halo-1-formylisoindole, which is hard
to
functionalize at the fused benzene moiety, there are a variety of
readily available 5-halo-2-formylpyrroles containing various electron-rich
(alkyl or alkoxy) substituents at the pyrrolic positions. Herein,
considering that pyrrolic alkyl substituents may greatly affect the
optical and electronic properties and the solubility of pyrrolylBODIPY
dyes, we have replaced 3-halo-1-formylisoindole with readily available
alkyl or alkoxy-substituted 5-halo-2-formylpyrroles and reported the
efficient synthesis of a set of A-, B-,
and C-ring-functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs 4 from the condensation of highly diverse 5-halo-2-formylpyrroles
with readily available pyrrole derivatives (Scheme 2), such as 2,4-dimethyl or 2,4-dimethyl-3-ethylpyrroles,
their characterizations via X-ray analysis, photophysical and electronic
properties, and the preliminary investigation of their applications
as an environmental sensitive “turn-on” fluorescence
probe for the detection of local polarity changes of biological samples,
as demonstrated in this work for bovine serum albumin (BSA).

Results
and Discussion
Syntheses and Characterizations
The key synthetic precursors,
5-halo-2-formylpyrroles 1a–c, were synthesized
using the literature-reported procedures22−28 (Scheme 1) via chlorination
and subsequent formylation reaction on pyrrole (Scheme 1a), the oxidation and subsequent decarboxylic
iodination reaction of 3b (Scheme 1b), and the Vilsmeier–Haack and the
subsequent hydrolysis of the resultant enamine intermediate 2c (Scheme 1c).

Scheme 1 Syntheses and Yields of 5-Halogenated 2-Formylpyrrole 1a–c
These resultant 5-halo-2-formylpyrroles 1a–c smoothly condensed with 2,4-dimethylpyrrole or 2,4-dimethyl-3-ethylpyrrole
in the presence of POCl3 and generated the desired pyrrolylBODIPYs 4 upon further BF2 complexation in one-pot with
rationable isolated yields (18–30%) (Scheme 2). In comparison with α-halogenated formylisoindoles,
these 5-halo-2-formylpyrroles show reduced electrophilicity in this
condensation reaction. It generally requires extended reaction time
and higher temperature for the completion of the reaction. The yields
are acceptable when considering the fact that most of these resultant B-ring alkyl-substituted pyrrolylBODIPYs are barely accessible
from the previous synthetic strategies. These resultant pyrrolylBODIPYs
and their key synthetic precursors were fully characterized with proton
nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), carbon nuclear magnetic
resonance (13C NMR), and high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS). The structure of 4b and 4c were
further confirmed by X-ray analysis (Figure 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis and Yields of PyrrolylBODIPYs 4a–f from
5-Halo-2-formylpyrroles 1a–c and Pyrrole Derivatives
X-ray Structure Analysis
Single crystals suitable for
X-ray analysis of 4b and 4c were obtained
by the slow diffusion of hexane into their dichloromethane solutions
at room temperature. Both of these two dyes crystallized in the monoclinic
system [P21/c for 4b, and P21/n for 4c, (Tables S1 and S2)]. The BODIPY subunit in these two dyes is planar, with the central
boron atoms coordinated with two neighboring nitrogen atoms in a tetrahedral
geometry (Figures S1 and 2). The plane defined by the two fluorine atoms and the center
boron atom is perpendicular to that of the BODIPY fragment, characteristic
for most previously reported BODIPY dyes.20,21 Alkyl substituents on the coordinated pyrrole B unit
greatly affect the dihedral angle between the BODIPY fragment and
the uncoordinated pyrrole A moiety. The dihedral angles
between the uncoordinated pyrrole A unit and the plane
of the BODIPY fragment are 48.9(2)° for 4b and 25.3(1)°
for 4c. The larger dihedral angles observed for 4b with respect to 4c may be attributed to the
steric hindrance effect of methyl substitution in the coordinated
pyrrole B unit and the adjacent methyl substituent on
the uncoordinated pyrrole A unit. Various intramolecular
hydrogen bondings were observed among the hydrogen in the NH moiety
of the uncoordinated pyrrole A unit, the fluorine atoms
in the BF2 unit, and the hydrogen of methyl substituent
in the 5-position of the uncoordinated pyrrole A unit.
The F–H distance between the hydrogen atom of the 5-methyl
group and the fluorine atoms is in the range of 2.581–2.846
Å. These hydrogen bondings restrict the rotations of the uncoordinated
pyrrole A unit.

Spectroscopic Properties
PyrrolylBODIPYs 4a–f all show bright red fluorescence under 365 nm
handheld UV lamp irradiation
condition in solvents including
hexane, toluene, and dichloromethane. Their photophysical spectra
were analyzed in dichloromethane as shown in Figures 3 and S2–S7, and the corresponding data are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. These pyrrolylBODIPYs
show strong absorption (centered at around 570–624 nm) and
emission (centered at around 591–654 nm) in dichloromethane,
which are comparable to the commercialized BODIPY 576/589 (Figure 1).

By fixing
the substituent patterns on both A- and C-rings, the installation of electron-donating substituent(s)
at the B-ring causes significant blue shift of the absorption/emission
bands of these pyrrolylBODIPYs. The more electron-rich substituents
on B-ring, the greater the blue shift of the spectra.
As shown in Figure 3, a gradual blue shift of the absorption/emission bands was observed
from 4a (607/632 nm) to 4b (588/630 nm)
and 4c (570/591 nm). Similar trend is also observed from 4d (624/654 nm) to 4e (606/646 nm) and 4f (586/609 nm). These pyrrolylBODIPYs 4a–f exhibit intense fluorescence (ϕ = 0.41–0.99) in hexane.
Their fluorescence decay profiles fit a single-exponential decay with
lifetimes in the range of 2.62 to 6.11 ns in anhydrous dichloromethane
(Table 1, Figures S8–S13), which are comparable
to the most reported BODIPYs.29

As
summarized in Table 2, the solvatochromic effect on λabsmax and λemmax for each compound was studied
in seven different organic solvents (Figures S2–S7). These results indicated that λabsmax and λemmax of the six pyrrolylBODIPYs are positioned
within relative narrow wavelength ranges (13–26 nm for absorption
and 9–35 nm for emission of the six pyrrolylBODIPYs). Bathochromical
shifts were also observed for λabsmax and λemmax with increasing solvent polarizability
(from acetonitrile to toluene), similar to many reported BODIPYs.22,30

A gradual decrease in the fluorescence quantum yields was
observed
for these pyrrolylBODIPYs with the increase in solvent dipolar moments
from hexane to toluene, dichloromethane, THF, methanol, acetonitrile,
DMSO, and PBS (Table 2, Figure S14b). For example, a gradual
decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield for 4f was
observed with the increase in solvent dipolar moments from hexane
(0.70) to toluene (0.51), dichloromethane (0.44), THF (0.31), methanol
(0.04), acetonitrile (0.08), DMSO (0.06), and PBS (0.03). This solvent-dependent
fluorescence emission can be observed by naked eye under 365 nm handheld
UV lamp irradiation condition (Figure 4). The quantum yields and fluorescence lifetimes of 4c and 4f having the electron-rich methoxy group
are much higher than those of other pyrrolylBODIPYs in almost all
solvents, for example, in CH2Cl2 and THF, as
summarized in Table 1, which might result from that their nonradiative rate constants
are much smaller than those of others.

Electrochemical Properties
Cyclic
voltammetry (CV)
of pyrrolylBODIPYs 4a–f measured in anhydrous
dichloromethane containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate
(TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte is shown in Figure 5 and is summarized
in Table 3. Among these, 4a and 4d each exhibit an irreversible reduction
wave with the half-wave potential at 0.68 and 0.53 V, respectively,
and a reversible oxidation wave (with Epc at −1.21 and −1.25 V, respectively) [vs saturated
calomel electrode (SCE)]. By contrast, 4b–c and 4e–f each show one reversible reduction wave and one
reversible oxidation wave. For example, the half-wave potentials for
the reduction/oxidation waves are at −1.23/0.71 V for 4b and −1.31/0.65 V for 4c (vs SCE). On
the basis of the onset potential of their first oxidation and reduction
waves, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels for 4a, 4b, and 4c were estimated to be at −4.99/–3.31,
−5.02/–3.25, and −4.96/–3.17 eV, respectively.
The corresponding energy band gaps for 4a, 4b, and 4c are 1.68, 1.77, and 1.79, respectively. The
installation of electron-rich alkyl and alkoxy substituents on the
coordinated pyrrole B-ring unit causes the decrease in
the energy band gaps of these dyes. Similar results were observed in pyrrolylBODIPYs 4d–f, which are
in good agreement with their spectra.

The redox potentials
for 4d measured via CV in various
solvents with different polarities, such as DMSO, acetonitrile, THF,
and dichloromethane, are summarized in Table 4. The decrease in the reduction potential
for 4d was observed from CH3CN (−0.91
V) to THF (−1.11 V) and CH2Cl2 (−1.25
V) as shown in Figures 5 and S15. This indicates that the pyrrolylBODIPY
is relatively easier to be reduced in solvents with solvent polarizability
increased, and these pyrrolylBODIPYs might undergo photoinduced electron-transfer
processes from uncoordinated pyrrole A-ring to the BODIPY
fragment.

Density Functional
Theory Calculations
For the further
understanding of the photophysical properties of these pyrrolylBODIPYs,
the ground-state geometries of pyrrolylBODIPYs 4a, 4b, and 4c were optimized using density functional
theory (DFT) calculations at B3LYP/6-31G (d) level based on their
crystal data. The HOMO and LUMO of these pyrrolylBODIPYs were mainly
distributed at the pyrrolylBODIPY chromophores (Figure 6), which is similar to their isoindole-derived
pyrrolylBODIPY analogues.21 The installation
of alkyl substituents on the coordinated pyrrole B-ring
causes the increase in the HOMO–LUMO energy band gaps from 4a (2.39 eV) to 4b (2.44 eV). Replacing these
alkyl-substituents with a more electron-rich methoxy group further
increases the HOMO–LUMO energy band gap to 2.56 eV (for 4c). This increased HOMO–LUMO energy band gap is in
good agreement with the observed blue shift of the spectra and the
CV measurement.

We further performed time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT)
calculations on 4a–c in dichloromethane using
the self-consistent reaction field method and the polarizable continuum
model (Table S3). The calculated absorption
wavelength maximum (in the range of 502–534 nm) is blue-shifted
with respect to the observed experimental spectra, which is similar
to that disclosed in some recent publications.31 The lowest energy absorption bands for these pyrrolylBODIPY
dyes are mainly contributed by their HOMO → LUMO transitions
with respect to their electronic transition from the ground states
to the first excited ones (S0 → S1).

Biological Applications
of These PyrrolylBODIPYs
To
demonstrate the potential application of these pyrrolylBODIPYs as
environmental-sensitive probes in biological systems, the application
of these pyrrolylBODIPYs for sensing BSA in PBS was investigated.
As shown in Figures 7 and S16, each of these pyrrolylBODIPYs
shows relatively broad absorption with a weak fluorescence emission
in the PBS buffer solution. The addition of BSA caused a red shift
of the absorption and a significant enhancement of the absorption
coefficients.

Figure 7 Fluorescence changes of pyrrolylBODIPYs 4 (5 μM)
with or without BSA (40 μM) in PBS buffer containing 1% DMSO
as a cosolvent; photographs of solution before and after the addition
of BSA under natural light (i) and under 365 nm handheld UV lamp irradiation
condition (ii); and fluorescence spectra of the solutions of 4a (a), 4b (b), 4a (c), 4d (d), 4e (e), and 4f (f) without BSA (black
lines) or with BSA (red lines).

More importantly, all of these pyrrolylBODIPYs showed a dramatic
fluorescence increase in the presence of BSA as shown in Figure 7 (very weak fluorescence
without BSA and strong fluorescence with BSA). Obvious spectral red
shifts of the fluorescence emission bands for these pyrrolylBODIPYs 4a–c and almost no change for 4d–f were also observed, and the data are summarized in Table 5. For example, the addition
of BSA to 4d in PBS, which has the longest maximum emission
wavelength among these six pyrrolylBODIPYs, brings a gradual increase
in the fluorescence intensity (up to 40-fold) (Figure 8). PyrrolylBODIPY 4d interacts
with BSA with a binding constant of 5.7 × 104 M–1 (Figure S17), which is
similar to the reported BSA probes.1 Less
extent but similar fluorescence response was also observed for binding 4d with other proteins (chicken serum protein, casein, and

It should be noted
here that the relative broad absorption and
low extinction coefficient for our pyrrolylBODIPYs 4 indicated
their possible aggregations in aqueous PBS media owing to their hydrophobic
character. Thus, our turn on response of pyrrolylBODIPYs 4 in the presence of BSA may also be ascribed to the disaggregation-induced
fluorescence enhancement, which has been reported as a powerful method
to develop interesting fluorescent probes.32a For example, BODIPY-based fluorescent probe for selectively imaging
tau protein aggregates32b and RecA inteins32c has been reported recently. We thus measured
the UV–vis titration of 4d in PBS buffer with
the addition of various equivalents of BSA. The absorption only showed
slight increase when increasing the concentration of BSA from 0 to
30 μM (as shown in Figure S19). Large
increase in absorption intensity was only observed when further increasing
the concentration of BSA from 30 to 50 μM. By contrast, the
fluorescence intensity of 4d at 645 nm exhibited almost
40-fold increase with the addition of 30 μM BSA (Figure 8). These results indicated
that this turn on response of pyrrolylBODIPYs 4 in the
presence of BSA may be at least in part due to the changes in polarity,
although pyrrolylBODIPYs may bind with the surface of BSA as aggregates
in aqueous PBS.

Conclusions
We have synthesized
six novel A-, B-, C-ring-functionalized
pyrrolylBODIPYs 4 from
a POCl3-promoted condensation of various readily available
(alkyl or methoxyl substituted) 5-halo-2-formylpyrrole with pyrroles.
X-ray analysis shows that the installation of alkyl or methoxy substituents
at the pyrrole B-ring of these pyrrolylBODIPYs greatly
affects the dihedral angle between the BODIPY chromophore and the
uncoordinated A-ring in the solid state. Installation
of these electron-rich substituents on the B-ring brings
a dramatic blue shift of the absorption and emission spectra. This
is in great contrast to those substituents on pyrrole A- and C-rings, which generally cause red shift of the
spectra. CV and DFT calculations confirm that these substituents on
the B-ring cause a significant increase in the HOMO–LUMO
energy band gap for the pyrrolylBODIPY chromophore. These pyrrolylBODIPYs
show an intense absorption (570–632 nm) and fluorescence emission
(582–654 nm) in nonpolar solvents (such as hexane, toluene,
and dichloromethane), which changes dramatically with the variation
in the polarity of the solvents. This polarity dependency and the
deep red/NIR emission may find potential applications of these pyrrolylBODIPYs
as environment-sensitive fluorescence probes for biological samples
as demonstrated in this work for BSA.

Experimental Section
General
Reagents and solvents were used as received
from commercial suppliers unless noted otherwise. All reactions were
performed in oven-dried or flame-dried glassware and were monitored
by thin-layer chromatography. Flash column chromatography was performed
using silica gel (300–400 mesh). 1H NMR and 13C NMR (75 MHz) spectra were recorded at 300 or 500 MHz by
a NMR spectrometer in DMSO-d6 or CDCl3. Chemical shifts (δ) were given in ppm relative to
CDCl3 (7.26 ppm for 1H and 77 ppm for 13C) or internal tetramethyl silane (δ = 0 ppm) as internal standard.
Data were reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity, coupling
constants, and integration. HRMS spectra were obtained using APCI-TOF
in the positive mode. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded
on a Shimadzu UV-4100 spectrophotometer, and fluorescence spectra
were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer,
with a quartz cuvette (path length = 1 cm).

Photophysical Measurements
The absorption and fluorescence
emission spectra for these pyrrolylBODIPYs 4a–f were measured in hexane, toluene, dichloromethane, THF, acetonitrile,
methanol, DMSO, and PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature. The relative
fluorescence quantum yields for 4a–f were determined
by comparing the areas under the corrected emission spectrum of the
test sample in various organic solvents Cresyl violet perchlorate
(ϕ = 0.54 in anhydrous methanol)33 as the standards. Non-degassed, spectroscopic grade solvents and
a 10 mm quartz cuvette were used. Dilute solutions (0.01 < A < 0.05) were used to minimize the reabsorption effects.
Quantum yields were determined using the following equation34  where ϕS is the reported
quantum yield of the standard, I is the integrated
emission spectra, A is the absorbance at the excitation
wavelength, and n is the refractive index of the
solvent being used. X subscript is the test sample, and S subscript
is the standard.

Fluorescence lifetimes (τ) of the S1
state were measured by time-correlated single-photon counting method
on an Edinburgh FLS920 steady-state lifetime fluorescence spectrometer
with corresponding excitation and emission being monitored at the
peak maximum. The fluorescence lifetime values were obtained from
deconvolution and distribution lifetime analysis. When the fluorescence
decays were single exponential, the rate constants of radiative (Kf) and nonradiative (Knr) deactivation were calculated from the measured fluorescence
quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime in dichloromethane using the
following equation: Kf = ϕ/τ
and Knr = (1 – ϕ)/τ.

CVs
CV experiments were performed with a Bioanalytical
Systems Inc. (BASi) Epsilon potentiostat and analyzed using BASi Epsilon
software. Electrochemical cells are consisted of a three-electrode
setup including a glassy carbon as the working electrode, platinum
wire as the counter electrode, and SCE as the pseudo reference electrode.
Experiments were run at 20 mV s–1 scan rates in
degassed dichloromethane solutions of the analytes (∼1 mM)
and supporting electrolyte (0.1 M TBAPF6) at room temperature.
CVs were referenced against an external standard (∼1 mM potassium
ferricyanide) and corrected for external cell resistance using the
BASi Epsilon software.

Crystallography
Crystals of pyrrolylBODIPYs 4b and 4c suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained
by
slow diffusion of hexane into their dichloromethane solutions. Diffraction
was performed on a Bruker SMART APEXII CCD area detector diffractometer
using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073
Å) at 293(2) K, with ϕ and ω scan techniques. An
empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program.35 All structures were solved by direct methods,
completed by subsequent difference Fourier syntheses, and refined
anisotropically for all non-hydrogen atoms by full-matrix least-squares
calculations based on F2 using the SHELXTL
program package.36 The hydrogen atom coordinates
were calculated with SHELXTL by using an appropriate riding model
with varied thermal parameters. The residual electron densities were
of no chemical significance. Crystal structures of 4b (CCDC 1055369) and 4c (CCDC 978649) are provided in
the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data
can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.

Computational Details
All of the calculations were
carried out by the methods implemented in Gaussian 09 package37 on the ground-state geometry, which were optimized
by using the DFT method at the B3LYP/6-31G (d) level.38 The same method was used for vibrational analysis to verify
that the optimized structures correspond to local minima on the energy
surface. At the optimized geometries, TD DFT computations were used
to obtain the vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths
under the B3LYP/6-31+G (d) theoretical level.
