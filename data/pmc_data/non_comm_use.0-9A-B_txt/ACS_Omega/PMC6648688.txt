In
this study, we fabricated composites of conducting carbon black
(CB), room-temperature ferromagnetic Sr3YCo4O10+δ (SYCO) and polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) by
the solution mixing and coagulation method for the first time. During
the nucleation process of PVDF, the presence of SYCO and CB individually
facilitates the crystallization of polar β and semipolar γ
phases along with the nonpolar α phase in PVDF. The dc electrical
conductivity of PVDF raised from 1.54 × 10–8 to 9.97 S/m with the addition of 30 wt % of CB, and it is nearly
constant with respect to the SYCO content. The PVDF/CB/SYCO composites
(PCS) possess high permittivity and its variation is in accordance
with the content of polar phases in PVDF. Moreover, the complex permittivity
and permeability spectra from 10 MHz to 1 GHz indicate that the dielectric
loss dictates over magnetic loss in these composites. The electromagnetic
interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of PCS composites is
higher than that of PVDF/CB and PVDF/SYCO composites in the 8.2–18
GHz region. Addition of SYCO in the PVDF/CB matrix enhances shielding
by dominated absorption with minimal reflection. The analysis of the
shielding mechanism suggests that in addition to conducting and magnetic
losses due to CB and SYCO, respectively, the synergy among CB, SYCO,
and PVDF promotes shielding by matching the input impedance to that
of free space, enhancing multiple internal reflections from SYCO and
subsequent absorption by CB, eddy current losses, dielectric damping
losses, interfacial polarization losses, and so forth. These different
mechanisms result in an enhanced EMI SE of 50.2 dB for the PCS-40
composite for a thickness of 2.5 mm.

Introduction
Ever since the electronic
revolution, electronic devices have become
an indispensable part of common man’s life. The rapid increase
in the usage of such devices as well as instruments dealing with electromagnetic
(EM) waves generates a serious issue of EM interference (EMI). Scientists
have turned their attention toward EMI as the devices began to grow
smaller and smarter. Presently, with respect to the necessity and
application, different frequencies in the microwave frequency bands
are allocated for various purposes, especially for communication.
As a result of the extensive use of such EM devices, tremendous amount
of unwanted energy is radiated into the surroundings. Because of this,
all the organisms as well as the devices are engulfed into the exposure
to this radiation atmosphere. Owing to this long-term exposure to
such radiation, adverse biological effects like breaking of DNA, weakening
of biological immune system,1 leukaemia,
cancer2,3 and so forth and technological effects like
malfunctioning of devices, information leakages and so forth are encountered.
Shielding is one of the best remedies to avoid or rather reduce the
problem of EMI, mainly, as its effectiveness depends on the performance
of the material used as shield and because it can be finely tuned
or tailored by availing current advanced technologies.4−8

The underlying criteria for choosing an effective shielding
material
rely not only on its ability to safeguard the devices from external
stray signals but also on its capability to optimize the emissions
from the devices to a lower value. These can be achieved either by
reflecting and/or absorbing the EM energy. Reflection, which occurs
prior, is the result of significant interactions of EM signals with
the charge carriers present in the shielding materials. On account
of this, the shielding materials are expected to be electrically conducting.
Absorption, which is considered as an ecofriendly way to shield EM
radiation occurs as soon as the signals enter into the shield, as
a consequence of the interaction of the radiation with the electric
and magnetic dipole fences in them.8 In
order to enter the radiation into the material, it should have a matching
input impedance to that of free space impedance. Generally, the EM
energy attenuation inside the materials mainly arises due to the dielectric
loss, magnetic loss, and their synergistic effect. The dielectric
loss depends mainly on the conductivity loss and relaxation loss.
Under an alternating EM field, the dipoles present in the defective
sites and interfaces undergo oscillation and results in relaxation
loss. In heterostructure materials, Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars
(MWS) polarization has more contribution toward polarization losses.
The magnetic loss mainly arises from the magnetic resonance, hysteresis
loss, eddy current loss, and magnetic after effect losses.2 In addition to these, multiple internal reflections
that occur at the interfaces or defect centers within the material
also contributes to EMI shielding. However, most of the materials,
which suffice the requisiteness of necessary electric and magnetic
properties, lack mechanical flexibility which withholds their direct
usage in EMI shielding applications. Under such circumstances, addition
of suitable polymer materials provides the mechanical flexibility,
compressibility and so forth and additionally, helps to mold the shield
into desired shapes. The polymer selection is solely based on one’s
requirement. Thus, an efficient composite material can be fabricated
by adding one or more filler materials having appropriate electric
and magnetic properties into a suitable polymer matrix.

Innumerable
combinations were studied with different permutations
of polymers, conducting materials, and magnetic materials intending
special applications. Among the choice of polymers, polyvinylidenefluoride
(PVDF) is a technologically predominant thermoplastic with largest
piezo- and pyro-electric coefficients along with outstanding chemical
and thermal resistivity. Insulating and nonmagnetic PVDF is widely
used for EMI shielding applications by adding suitable fillers bearing
these properties because these are the imperative requirement for
EM wave attenuation. PVDF exists in five polymorphic forms (α,
β, γ, δ, and ε), of which α, β,
and γ are the most important forms. A nonpolar α phase
with a monoclinic unit cell is the commonly existing phase with trans–gauche
(TGTG̅) chain conformation while the highly polar β phase
which crystallizes to an orthorhombic unit cell has all trans (TTTT)
conformation. The semipolar γ polymorph formed under high pressure
and temperature also has an orthorhombic unit cell but has T3GT3G̅ chain conformation. The remaining two phases
δ and ε are the polar and antipolar analogs of α
and γ forms, respectively.9−11 Recently, active research studies
are being carried out to nucleate PVDF in the β polymorphic
phase, following its polar nature which makes it suitable for piezoelectric,
pyroelectric, and dielectric applications. Incorporation of organically
modified nanoclay,12 graphene sheets,13 functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes,9,14 metal nanoparticles,15,16 and ferrite nanoparticles into
the PVDF matrix is often traced out methods for achieving β
crystallization. For the first time, Deepa et al. studied the effect
of particle size of a double perovskite compound La0.5Sr0.5CoO3−δ (LSCO) on the phase crystallization
of PVDF and the resulting dielectric properties of PVDF/LSCO composites.17 Even though there were studies on the variation
of dielectric properties with PVDF phase change,18 its influence on EMI shielding is not investigated so far.

The prime concern for a good magnetic filler always goes to ferrite
materials owing to their better magnetic loss. There have been extensive
studies on the EMI shielding performance of ferrite-added polymer
composites and to investigate their size and shape dependence on shielding.19−24 Most of them reveal dominated microwave absorption mechanism rather
than reflections hence are useful for microwave absorbing materials
applications like in radar stealth technology. The fabrication of
hybrid composites of conducting and magnetic materials is a widely
adopted strategy to optimize microwave absorption performance and
bandwidth. There are many reports on graphene-based hybrid materials
incorporated with different ferrite materials. NiFe2O4 clusters in nitrogen-doped graphene25 and Fe3O4 magnetic filler-incorporated reduced
graphene oxide (rGO) composites26 are examples
for such hybrid materials showing effective microwave absorption with
improved bandwidth. Even though the cobalt containing oxygen deficient
perovskite family includes members having comparable magnetic properties,
their EMI shielding property is least explored. Dijith et al.27 studied microwave shielding properties of an
oxygen deficient compound La0.5Sr0.5CoO3−δ—epoxy composites for microwave shielding
applications. One of the main factors which limits their application
is their lower curie temperature, and hence, such materials are not
suitable for applications at room temperature.28 Cao et al.29 synthesized a flower-like
Co3O4@rGO/SiO2 composite showing
high-temperature MA performance. In most of the magnetic and conducting
materials containing composites, in addition to the conducting and
magnetic loss, their synergy also promotes microwave absorption. The
compound Sr3YCo4O10+δ (SYCO)
is found to be exhibiting ferromagnetism with highest transition temperature
(Tc = 335 K) compared to other cobalt
oxide perovskites.30−33 In this, A sites are occupied by Sr2+ and Y3+ ions while B sites are occupied by Co ions. The various spin states
of Co ions owing to various oxidation states, surrounding crystal
field, coordination number, and type of neighbouring ions are the
undisputed cause for the observed magnetism in this class of compounds.34 In the present study, effective microwave absorbing
composite materials were fabricated by reinforcing PVDF with cost-effective
conducting carbon black (CB) and magnetic SYCO by simple solution
mixing and coagulation procedure. The microwave absorption enhancement
of the composite material with the addition of SYCO and its underlying
mechanism were investigated. Also, the role of SYCO and CB incorporation
in the phase crystallization of PVDF and its effect on EMI shielding
is also discussed in detail.

Results and Discussion
Structure and Morphology
The crystal structure of the
synthesized compound and fabricated composites was studied using X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and the patterns are given in Figure 1. The diffraction peaks observed at 33.0°,
40.8°, 47.4°, 59.1°, 69.5°, and 79.1° are,
respectively, assigned to the reflections from (204), (224), (008),
(228), (408), and (604) planes of SYCO (ICDD: 01-078-4256). No reflections
corresponding to other phases were observed in the XRD patterns indicating
good crystallinity and phase purity of the compound. The patterns
can be indexed based on the tetragonal crystal structure with the I4/mmm space group having refined lattice
parameters a = 7.645(4) Å and c = 15.348(5) Å. After fabricating composites by mixing SYCO
in the PC matrix, the relative intensity of the PVDF and CB peaks
shows a gradual decrease while that of SYCO shows a gradual increase.
This suggests the effective incorporation of SYCO into the PC matrix
without any loss that may occur during the coagulation process.

Figure 1 XRD patterns
of SYCO, PVDF, CB, and PCS composites.

The surface morphology and uniformity of the filler dispersion
in the matrix were studied using field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) analysis. The surface morphology of SYCO (Figure S1) shows that it forms an agglomerated
structure with irregular grains. SEM images of a few PCS composites
are presented in Figure 2. The connected networks formed by CB are clear from the surface
and fracture surface images of PC, PCS-10, and PCS-40 composites (Figure 2a–f). There
is no particle agglomeration observed on the surface of the composite
PCS-10 and is uniform. However, in the case of maximum SYCO-loaded
composite PCS-40, the top surfaces contain SYCO particles in cluster
forms. The fractured surface of the entire studied composite indicates
an almost uniform dispersion of the filler in the polymer matrix.
Here, in the case of filler materials with higher tendency to form
aggregates, rapid coagulation is an effective method for solvent removal
because it can avoid the settling down of particles that may occur
during solvent evaporation.

XPS analysis shows the presence
of Co2+ and Co3+ ions as the surface states
in the SYCO lattice with Co3+/Co2+ molar ratio
0.53. The spectra are given in Figure S2. The temperature dependence of magnetization
and its isothermal field response are studied using vibrating sample
magnetometer (VSM). The response curve (Figure S3a,b) indicates that the compound exhibits ferromagnetism
with a high transition temperature of 335 K. The detailed analysis
of the XPS spectra and VSM response curve are provided in the Supporting Information.

Identification of Electroactive
Phases
Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS)
techniques are often used to identify the crystallized phases in PVDF.
However, it is difficult to distinguish α and γ phases
from WAXS patterns. Likewise, some FTIR modes are similar for both
β and γ phases. Hence the combination of these two techniques
is essential to identify the exact phase determination in PVDF.

The WAXS patterns of melt blended PVDF, PC, PCS-30, and PVDF with
30 wt % of SYCO (S: 30 wt %) are shown in Figure 3. The diffraction peaks observed are around
17.9°, 18.5°, 20.2°, and 26.5° 2θ angles.
The intense reflection peak around 20° is common for α,
β, and γ phases of PVDF. For the pure β form, only
one peak at 20.3° is reported and is attributed to the combined
reflections from its (110) and (200) planes.17,35 The observed peak around 26.5° is a characteristic reflection
of the α phase and is present in all the composites. In CB-containing
composites, this peak shows a broadening due to the superposition
of XRD from (200) planes of CB, which is around 25.6°.36 Out of the two other reflections, one at 17.9°
is due to (100) α planes and other at 18.5° may be due
to (020) α and/or γ planes.37 There are SYCO reflections at 11.7°, 21.0°, and 23.4°
(ICDD: 01-078-4256) in composites containing SYCO.

Figure 3 WAXS patterns of PVDF,
PC(C:30 wt %), S:30 wt %, and PCS-30.

The composites were characterized using attenuated total
reflectance
FTIR spectroscopy. The individual contribution of SYCO and CB on the
PVDF nucleation is shown in Figure 4a. For melt-blended PVDF, the strong absorption bands
at 483, 530, 613, 761, 795, and 976 cm–1 stem from
the α phase.9,10,13,18,35,37,38 The absorptions at
613 and 761 cm–1 are due to CF2-bending
and skeletal-bending motions in PVDF and at 795 and 976 cm–1 correspond to CH2 rocking motion. The signature absorption
band of polar β and semipolar γ phase at 840 cm–1 (CH2 rocking and CF2 stretching motion) shows
an increase in intensity with SYCO addition from 20 to 40 wt % and
also with the CB content. However, it has been recently accepted that
for γ PVDF, this band will be appeared as a shoulder band of
833 cm–1.35 Another band,
which also represents β and γ phases is at 510 cm–1, shows an increase with SYCO addition but no considerable
variation with the CB content. The intensity of absorption at 1232
cm–1 corresponding to the γ phase increased
with SYCO and CB and also the absorption at 1275 cm–1 arises due to CH2 wagging motion, which solely characterizes
the β phase increased with CB and SYCO. These observations along
with reduction in intensity of α absorption bands at 530, 613,
761, and 795 cm–1 with filler loading also suggests
that these two fillers individually facilitate polar β phase
and semipolar γ phase nucleation in PVDF. There is no considerable
variation in the intensity of 871 cm–1 absorption
due to CF–CF–CH–CF bending motion but it shifts
to 875 cm–1 with filler loading due to specific
interactions.39

PCS composites.

Mechanical Properties
Figure 5a shows
the stress–strain curve for
the PCS composites studied at room temperature. The Young’s
modulus, elongation at break, tensile strength, and toughness of the
materials are calculated from the stress–strain plots and are
shown in Figure 5b–d.
The Young’s modulus of the composites increases with the SYCO
content, that is, the stress required to produce unit strain in the
composites increases as the filler content increases. This may be
because of the more compact nature of the composites with higher filler
loading occurred during hot-pressing. From the bar diagram, it can
be identified that the tensile strength of the composites increases
with the SYCO content, however, the elongation at break decreases
with the concentration of SYCO. These observations are also due to
the stiffness of the composites. The decreasing value of toughness
with the SYCO content may be attributed to the lack of interface regions
capable to transfer the applied stress throughout the composites.9 The decreased value of Young’s modulus
of PVDF compared to other reports may be due to the processing condition
like pressure, temperature, and time duration.

plot, (b) Young’s modulus, (c)
toughness and tensile strength, and (d) elongation at break of PCS
composites.

Electrical Conductivity
The electrical conductivity
of a material has a positive role in its EMI shielding efficiency.
When the content of a conducting filler reaches electrical percolation
threshold, it forms a conducting network. Here, the conductivity of
the composites results from CB and it is essential to determine whether
the conductivity is maintained even after the addition of SYCO. To
explore this, the room-temperature dc conductivity is studied and
is shown in Figure 6. The dc conductivity value of pure PVDF is 1.54 × 10–8 S/m and is increased to 9.97 S/m with the addition of 30 wt % of
CB (PC) and is maintained almost unchanged with the SYCO content.
When 40 wt % of SYCO is added (PCS-40) into PC, the conductivity value
shows a slight decrease to 8.46 S/m. For a material to be suitable
for EMI shielding, its volume electrical conductivity should be at
least 1 S/m.40,41 Here, the CB network attains
this marginal value.

Figure 6 dc electrical conductivity of PCS composites.

Dielectric and Magnetic Properties
The permittivity
and permeability of materials determine their response in the EM field.
The absorbance of the EM wave by a material is directly related to
its complex permittivity εr = ε′ –
jε″ and complex permeability μr = μ′
– jμ″. The real part of permittivity (ε′)
and permeability (μ′) accounts to the energy confining
potential of the material, whereas the imaginary part of these two
quantities (ε″ and μ″) gives the energy
dissipation.

The frequency dispersion curve of permittivity
and permeability within the frequency range from 10 MHz to 1 GHz at
room temperature is shown in Figure 7a,b. The ε′ of the PC composite is about
102 times higher than that of PVDF. This sudden rise in
permittivity may be attributed to the increased conductivity of the
PC composite compared to PVDF. The variation in the permittivity with
SYCO addition is in accordance with two reasons, one is due to the
crystallized polar phases of PVDF induced by CB and SYCO and other
is due to MWS polarization. Second one is the major reason for the
improvement in the permittivity in heterogeneous systems, which is
related to the trapping of free charge carriers at the interfaces
of fillers and matrices due to the contrast in their electrical conductivity.42,43 The decreasing permittivity with frequency is because at high frequencies,
the polarizations cannot follow the variations in the applied EM signal.44 In this case, the permittivity of PC is higher
than that of PVDF with 10 wt % of CB because the former has more content
of polar phases and conductivity than that of latter (Figure S4). In the case of PCS composites, PCS-10
has high relative permittivity than that of other composites as it
contains more amount of polar phases, which is evident from FTIR and
less agglomeration compared to other composites as evident from SEM
images. Here, the agglomeration may affect the permittivity in two
ways, one is by sharing a part of energy available for the reorientation
of PVDF chains to form polar phases and other is by destroying the
original conductor insulator boundaries.43 The relative permittivity of PVDF is slightly influenced by SYCO
alone (Figure S5). The composite with 30
wt % of SYCO (S:30 wt %) has a high permittivity than that of other
PVDF/SYCO composites due to a subtle balance between the polarity
of PVDF and agglomeration of SYCO. The imaginary part of permittivity
and its dielectric loss tangent shows a same frequency response as
observed for real permittivity. The higher dielectric loss of the
PCS composites stems from ohmic loss and polarization loss. Generally,
the ohmic losses dictate over polarization losses in the conducting
system.42 In this percolative composite
system, the higher value of dielectric loss is due to the high conductivity
and the variations observed are due to the polarization loss arising
from the increased interfaces and the polar phase content in PVDF.
For the hot-pressed PVDF/MWCNTs/BaTiO3 (3.0/37.1 vol %)
system fabricated by the miscible–immiscible coagulation method
has a real permittivity and dielectric loss of 71.7 and of 0.045,
respectively, at 1000 Hz frequency45 and
for PVDF/functionalized graphene–BaTiO3 (1.25/30
vol %) composites fabricated by two-step solution mixing followed
by hot-pressing, real permittivity is 65, and loss is 0.35 at 1 MHz
frequency.46 Here, we could attain a real
permittivity of 617.1 and a dielectric loss of 6.09 for 30 wt % of
the CB-added composite and for PCS-30, these values are 454.0 and
27.6, respectively, at 10 MHz.

Figure 7 (a) Real part and (b) imaginary part of
permittivity, (d) the real
part and (e) imaginary part of permeability, (c) dielectric loss tangent,
and (f) magnetic loss tangent of PCS composites from 10 MHz to 1 GHz.

Figure 7d,e shows
the complex permeability spectra of PCS-30 and PCS-40 composites.
The μ″ and tan δμ plots corresponding
to P and PC are avoided here due to the absence of the magnetic component
SYCO in them. The contributions to complex permeability arise mainly
from the domain wall motion occurring at low frequencies and spin
rotation preponderant at high frequencies.47 Here, beyond 100 MHz, the real and imaginary permeability increases
with frequency. The dielectric and magnetic losses are expressed as
loss tangents tan δε = ε″/ε′
and tan δμ = μ″/μ′,
respectively, and Figure 7c,f shows the variation of these quantities with frequency.
The higher values of tan δε compared to tan
δμ indicate that the composite possesses high
dielectric loss than magnetic loss. For microwave absorption, it is
very important to have a compatibility of these two losses. In this
case, the microwave absorption is mainly contributed by dielectric
loss rather than magnetic loss.

EMI Shielding Properties
and Mechanism
The EMI shielding
effectiveness (EMI SE) of a material describes its ability to attenuate
the energy of EM radiation. The shielding mechanism mainly include
reflection, absorption, and multiple internal reflection. For materials
having dominated absorption or having thickness greater than skin
depth, the energy of multiple reflected signals will be absorbed by
the material. In such cases, the EMI SE due to multiple internal reflection
is ignored.48,49 The energy absorbed from EM radiation
is generally converted as heat energy.50,51 The EMI SE
values due to absorption (SEA) as well as reflections (SER) can be calculated from the reflection and transmission scattering
parameters (S11, S22 and S12, S21) using the relations8,52 1   2   3  

Here, SET is the
total SE.

Above 20 dB of SET value is required for
commercial
applications and it means that the material can attenuate 99% of the
incident EM wave.53 The SEs dependence
on frequency of the X and Ku band regions for the PCS composites having
thickness 2.5 mm is displayed in Figure 8a.

Figure 8 (a) Total EMI SE of PCS composites in the X
and Ku band region
and (b) average values of SER, SEA, and SET of PCS composites.

The neat PVDF has an average SET value of 1.3
dB and
30 wt % CB-added PVDF composite crosses the marginal value of 20 dB
to an average SET value of 29.0 dB, which corresponds to
99.9% blockage of the incident EM wave. This abrupt change in the
shielding value mainly stems from the conductivity of CB. A steady
value of SE is observed in the entire frequency range, even for the
composite having higher loading of SYCO. This specifies the fact that,
in spite of the SYCO content, an excellent homogeneity and regularity
is maintained in the composites, which is supported by the conductivity
studies as shown in Figure 6.

The EMI shielding performance of PVDF/SYCO composites
having thickness
1.8 mm and the frequency dispersion curve of EMI SE in the two regions
are given in the Figure S6a. The shielding
performance of PVDF/SYCO composites is less than 5 dB and in which
the main contribution to total shielding is from the reflection of
EM waves at the shielding material and the absorption value almost
remains constant (Figure S6b). The reflection
mechanism in these composites is related to the mismatching of input
impedance of the composite materials with the free space impedance.54,55

In the case of PCS composites, the main contribution to shielding
is due to absorption rather than reflection, which almost remains
as constant for all the composites (Figure 8b). The PC composite itself has an EMI SE
value of 29.0 dB, in which 20.0 dB is due to absorption and 9.0 dB
is due to reflection and for the PCS-40 composite, out of the total
SE value of 50.2 dB, absorption contributes 41.2 dB and reflection
contributes 9.0 dB. The dominating absorption mechanism in PCS composites
indicates that the input impedance values of the composite materials
are close to the free space impedance, so that maximum EM signal can
enter into the material.56 The reversal
of dominated shielding mechanism from reflection to absorption from
PVDF/SYCO composites to PCS composites suggests that the synergy among
the dielectric and magnetic loss is essential to attain the maximum
input impedance match with the free space impedance. As soon as the
signal enters into the material, the energy of the signal gets absorbed
due to different mechanisms arising from the individual filler materials
and from their synergistic effect. This results in much enhanced EMI
SEs of the PCS composite with the increased content of SYCO (Figure 8a).

In PCS
composites, the dielectric, magnetic losses, and their synergy
contributes to the EM energy attenuation. The permittivity and permeability
studies indicate that the composite materials have dictating dielectric
loss than magnetic loss. According to the Debye theory, the imaginary
part of the permittivity (ε″) represents both polarization
loss and conducting loss.57 Here, the high
conductivity of the PCS composites indicates that the main contribution
to the energy attenuation is due to the presence of nomadic electrons
in conducting CB and this still exists in all the composites with
different wt % of SYCO, hence the incorporation of SYCO will not form
any discontinuities in the conducting percolation network formed by
CB as it is evident from the dc conductivity studies (Figure 6).

The second contribution
to microwave absorption in the composites
is due to the polarization losses which consists of both interfacial
polarization losses and dipolar relaxation losses. As the content
of SYCO increases, the interfacial polarization becomes more prominent.
Then, MWS polarization can happen at the interfaces due to the migrating
as well as hopping electrons.58 Moreover,
the WAXS and FTIR studies indicate that the incorporation of SYCO
and CB in PVDF facilitates the polar β and semipolar γ
phase nucleation in the polymer and this polar phase content in the
composite can also act as charge trapping centers and can enhance
the interfacial polarization losses. Also, there are interactions
of polar fluorine atoms in PVDF with the surfaces of SYCO and CB grains.
This specific interaction causes a damping effect when these dipoles
interact with EM radiation and cause dipolar relaxation losses, and
hence, the polar phases in PVDF are beneficial for the EM energy absorption.59

In addition to the dielectric loss, magnetic
properties are favorable
for EM energy attenuation.60,61 Here, the progressing
shielding performance with SYCO loading stems from the natural resonance
losses in SYCO due to the time lag of magnetization, produced by the
orientation of magnetic moments as well as domain wall motion behind
the magnetic field. The magnetic loss could also be arisen from the
eddy current loss. Since the presence of conducting network formed
by CB can reduce the EM energy by eddy current loss. In addition to
these individual contributions to EM energy absorption, synergy between
SYCO and CB also improves the microwave absorption performance in
PCS composites. Their combined effect can be explained like this:
the SYCO particles inside the composites cause multiple reflections
of radiations inside, which allows more time for CB to absorb the
EM energy. It is clear in the fracture surface SEM images of the composites
that the radiation reflected from the SYCO particles is radiated into
the conducting regions of CB. The possible mechanisms contributing
the shielding performance are schematically shown in Figure 9. These different mechanisms
result a maximum SE of 50.2 dB for the PCS-40 composite with a thickness
of 2.5 mm, which can shield about 99.9991% of the incident EM radiation
within the 8.2–18 GHz frequency range. The EMI SE of some polymer
composites containing carbon materials like CNTs and graphene and
iron oxides with the comparable filler content is listed in Table 1. Here, low-cost conducting
CB and ferromagnetic SYCO reinforced PVDF composites show high-performance
EMI shielding compared to other composites.

The
absorption property mainly depends on the thickness of the
shield (d) and skin depth (t), the
relation is as follows6 4  

Skin depth is defined as the distance
from the surface of the shield
at which the EM energy decreased to 1/e times of
the incident energy. The skin depth variation with frequency for PCS
composites is shown in Figure 10. From the SEA values, the average value
of skin depth obtained for the PCS-40 composite is 0.53 mm. The shielding
due to absorption depends on its thickness and should be greater than
the skin depth. Another factor has to be taken into consideration
is the density of the material. The specific SE (SSE) is a normalized
value that account for the thickness and density of the material,
which can be obtained as follows8 5  

Figure 10 Frequency
response of the skin depth of PCS composites.

The high SSE is the signature of a material to provide better
shielding
with minimum thickness having lower density. For PC and PCS-40, the
SSE values are 82 and 113 dB cm2 g–1,
respectively. Here, the attained SSE values are higher than the values
reported for graphene/polystyrene composites having 30 wt % of functionalized
graphene with 2.5 mm thickness.68 The average
values of shielding, shielding efficiency, and SSE of PCS composites
are listed in Table S1.

Here, the
PCS composite is a magnetic–dielectric composite
material, having a competitive synergy to enhance EM energy attenuation.
Because the dielectric loss is due to the conducting and relaxation
losses, the EM energy conversion power is contributed by charge transport
and relaxation. Likewise, the magnetic energy loss includes power
conversion from hysteresis loss, eddy current loss, and residual loss.69 This competing synergy has a significant role
in energy harvest and conversion. A systematic investigation on temperature-dependant
EMI shielding properties is required to understand wave attenuation
and energy conversion in PCS composites.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we fabricated PVDF composites reinforced with CB
and room temperature ferromagnetic Sr3YCo4O10+δ (SYCO) by a simple solution mixing and coagulation
method. It is a very effective method for fabricating homogeneous
composites of materials having large particle size and higher tendency
to form aggregates. The polar β and semipolar γ phases
of PVDF formed during its nucleation process in the presence of CB
and SYCO have an effect on the dielectric properties of the composites.
Furthermore, the electrical conductivities of the PCS composites remain
nearly constant even with the highest loading of SYCO. The dictating
dielectric loss over magnetic loss, the conducting losses of composites
as well as other mechanisms derived from the synergy among the fillers
and matrix result in an impressive EM SEs of 50.2 dB; out of it, 41.2
dB is from the absorption of EM energy by the material. This study
can also be extended to other matrix materials to achieve different
physical properties like flexibility, compressibility, and so forth.
Hence, this composite can be used as efficient microwave absorbers
in radar absorbing materials and also for military applications.

Experimental
Section
Materials
PVDF (average Mw = 534 000 by GPC) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. USA. The
organic solvent N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) (≥99.8%) was purchased from Merck Life Science Private
Limited, Mumbai. Carbon black (carbon black, acetylene, 50% compressed,
purity 99.9+ % and S.A. 75 m2/g) and cobalt(II,III) oxide
(99.7%) were purchased from Alfa-Aesar USA. Strontium carbonate (99.9%)
and yttrium(III) oxide (99.99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
USA. All the chemicals were used as received without any further treatment.

Sample Preparation
Oxygen-deficient double perovskite
Sr3YCo4O10+δ (SYCO) was synthesized
by a solid-state ceramic route and a calcination temperature of 1050
°C for 15 h is used. The synthesis procedure is given in the Supporting Information. CB and SYCO-reinforced
PVDF composites were fabricated by solution mixing and rapid coagulation
procedure schematically shown in Figure 11. PVDF powder was dissolved in DMF and required
weight percentages of filler materials were uniformly dispersed in
DMF. Then, these solutions were mixed well by magnetic stirring for
12 h and then coagulated using distilled water as the antisolvent.
The coagulated product was washed several times with distilled water
and then dried at 75 °C in a hot air oven. The dried composites
were then hot pressed at 250 °C temperature into rectangular
pellets having dimensions 22.86 × 10.16 mm (for X-band measurement)
and 15.79 × 7.89 mm (for Ku-band measurement) under a pressure
of 1 MPa applied for 1 hour. Cylindrical pellets of diameter 15 mm
and thickness 2.5 mm were prepared by hot pressing at the same temperature
and pressure conditions for permittivity measurements and toroid-shaped
pellets of inner diameter 6.7 mm, outer diameter 15 mm, and thickness
2.5 mm are used for permeability measurement. The sample codes assigned
are P (for PVDF), PC (for 30 wt % CB in PVDF matrix), and PCS-m (m = 10–40, m wt % of SYCO in PC matrix).

coagulation procedure for
the fabrication of composites.

Characterizations
XRD studies of SYCO and PCS composites
were carried out by a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer (40 kV, 40
mA) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) having a
nickel filter and Lynxeye position detector with the θ–2θ
scan mode. The various oxidation states of Co ions in SYCO were identified
using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer
with Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) as the excitation source and
a twin-crystal: micro-focused monochromator. The temperature dependence
of magnetization in SYCO and isothermal magnetic field response at
300 K of SYCO and PCS-30 was measured using Quantum Design Versa Lab
PPMS VSM. Morphological characterizations were done with a FEI-Nova
nanoSEM 450 field-emission scanning electron microscope with a beam
potential of 10 kV. PVDF phase identification in composites was carried
out using FTIR spectra taken by a PerkinElmer frontier FT-IR/far-infrared
spectrometer with a resolution of 2 cm–1 and 44
scans in the mid IR region and WAXS patterns. WAXS measurements made
in the transmission mode were carried out on a XEUSS SAXS/WAXS system
using a GeniX microsource from Xenocs operated at 50 kV and 0.6 mA.
In which, the Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) was collimated
with the FOX2D mirror and two pairs of scatterless slits from Xenocs
and 2D-patterns were recorded on a Mar345 image plate and processed
using the Fit2D software. The sample to detector distance was calibrated
with the silver behenate standard. Tensile tests were carried out
for the hot-pressed samples using a universal testing machine (Instron
model; 1195-5500R) at a strain rate of 1 mm/min at room temperature.
The experiments were repeated four times for each composite and average
values are reported. The room-temperature dc conductivity of the composites
was measured by the two-probe method using the Keithley 2400 Source.
The permittivity and permeability of the composites within the frequency
range from 10 MHz to 1 GHz was analysed using a Keysight E4991B impedance
analyser. The permittivity measurements were carried out using 16453A
test fixture after reducing the residual impedance and calibrating
the fixture by performing open/short calibration and load compensation,
respectively. The permeability measurements were done using 16454A
test fixture after open/short and load compensation. The EMI SEs values
in the X (8.2–12.4 GHz) and Ku (12.4–18 GHz) band regions
were calculated from the reflection (S11 and S22) and transmission (S21 and S21) scattering parameters
measured using a Vector Network Analyzer (Agilent E5071C) using the
waveguide method.
