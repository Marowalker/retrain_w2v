Chemotherapy
has been shown to be effective in reducing the progression
and development of cancer in metastatic patients. However, drug selectivity
is still a major issue for most chemotherapeutics. In this study,
we synthesized four novel heterocyclic compounds having similarity
in structure with quinone systems whereby nitrogen atoms replace the
oxygen atoms. The anticancer activity of these compounds (DIQ3-6) was tested against HCT116 human colon cancer cells. We showed that
all four heterocycles caused significant reduction in colon cancer
cell viability at doses as low as 4 μM, a concentration that
was not cytotoxic to normal human FHs74Int intestinal cell lines.
Interestingly, these heterocycles inhibited colon sphere formation
in 3D cultures at first generation (G1), mainly because
of inhibition of proliferation as evidenced by Ki67 staining. Thus, DIQ3 causes sufficient eradication of the self-renewal ability
of the highly resistant cancer stem cells. This study represents the
first documentation of the activity of these novel heterocyclic compounds,
particularly compound DIQ3, and their potential therapeutic
use in targeting colon cancer self-renewal capacity. Our findings
provide the basis for proposing these nontoxic and stable compounds
for additional testing against cancer.

Introduction
Over the past decades,
ongoing research in the fields of chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, surgery, and others have progressed noticeably.1,2 Despite improvements in all other fields, chemotherapy still plays
an essential role in cancer treatment, knowing that 90% of cancer
deaths are a result of metastasis.3

Most of the drugs used in cancer chemotherapy are of natural origin,
whether from plants, microorganisms, or even marine species.3 The active organic compounds that were extracted
from these natural sources have often been replaced with synthetic
ones.4 Recent studies have shown that some
quinones, which are often plant-derived secondary metabolites,5 are active agents against cancer.6

Quinones possess a cyclic structure with two keto
functional groups.7 In an aprotic medium,
each keto group can be
reduced in a one electron reduction step. The two successive steps
produce semiquinone and quinonedianion (Q2–), respectively.8 Some of the most well-known anticancer agents
that belong to the quinone family are shown in Figure 1. It is important to mention the belief that
the chemotherapeutic drugs adriamycin and mitomycin C act as anticancer
active agents through the redox quinone-hydroquinone system.9,10 In addition, p-quinonimines such as the 1,2,4-benzotriazinones
have shown anticancer activity.11,12

Figure 1 Structures of some anticancer
quinones.

Although more than 200 drugs have
been discovered with activity
against different types of cancer, each however has its own side effects.13 The main drawbacks of chemotherapy include the
presence of low and insufficient concentration of the drug at the
tumor site, high toxicity, and drug resistance.1 In addition, the major problem with chemotherapy is its
lack of selectivity, which leads to the death of both cancer and normal
cells.14

Targeted therapy emerged
with the aim of destroying only cancerous
cells, and currently, many drugs of this sort are FDA approved and
are being used. Even though it might have overcome the selectivity
issue in some cases, targeted therapy still causes some side effects.15

For several decades, chemotherapy drugs
for metastatic cancers
have shown partial benefit as only 50% of patients receiving therapy
develop recurrence.16 Therapy failure is
believed to occur because available chemotherapeutics shrink the tumor
bulk by eliminating the chemo-sensitive clones but do not eradicate
chemo-resistant clones or cancer stem cells (CSCs), which replenish
the tumor. Thus, the identification of a drug that simultaneously
targets CSCs and chemo-resistant cells is of high importance for clinical
treatment and for effective eradication of some types of cancer. CSCs
express distinctive arrays of surface biomarkers, which make them
vulnerable to therapies targeting multiple possible cellular pathways.16 In this study, we report the synthesis of four
novel heterocyclic compounds (Scheme 1); four of which were investigated for anticancer activity
against human colon cancer HCT116 cells.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the
Different Analogues of DIQ3
Results and Discussion
Compound DIQ3 and
its analogues (DIQ4-6) were synthesized in four steps
as illustrated in Scheme 1. All the intermediates (3a–d, 4a–d, 5a–d) involved in these reactions were isolated
and characterized as
well.

All compounds 3–5 were prepared at
room temperature
because compounds 3 and 5 are unstable at
high temperatures, yielding the corresponding benzimidazole derivative
in the presence of oxygen. Also, in preparation of compounds 3 and 5, the usage of a minimum amount of solvent
was very crucial to obtain high yields.

The preparation of imine 3 was accomplished through
the mono condensation between o-phenylenediamine 1 (1 equiv) and aldehyde 2 (1.2 equiv) at room
temperature. The formation of the imine (HC=N) bond can be
easily observed in the 1H NMR because of its diagnostic
CH between 8 and 9 ppm. Compound 3 was then reduced with
excess NaBH4 in methanol to afford 4. The
indicative peaks for this reduction in the 1H NMR are the
disappearance of the singlet at 8–9 ppm for the CH=N
and the appearance of a doublet at 4–5 ppm for the CH2 and a broad peak at around 5 ppm corresponding to the NH. Compound 4 (1 equiv) was further treated with 2-cyanobenzaldehyde (1.2
equiv) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in addition to a few drops of
acetic acid at room temperature to afford compound 5.
Upon treating orange compound 5 with an excess of KCN
(previously dissolved in water) in acetonitrile between 60 and 65
°C, compound DIQ precipitated out of solution as
a yellow solid. In bulk, the yellow precipitates (DIQ3-6) have a minor yellow component which travels fast on thin-layer
chromatography (TLC), which we believe results from hydrolysis of
the imino group to the hard to isolate keto form. The pure DIQ3-6 was obtained by leaching the yellow products with methanol to get
rid of this minor yellow impurity. All derivatives of DIQ were brightly fluorescent, except for DIQ5, which allowed
them to be easily visualized on TLC using long wavelength UV (365
nm). Furthermore, these compounds moved very slowly on TLC, even with
ethyl acetate–methanol (9:1) as the mobile phase.

The
addition of KCN followed by a cascade of reactions to afford
the different analogs of DIQ might be explained by the
proposed mechanism shown in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism of the Cascade Cyclization
The following mechanism was
proposed based on similar cyanation
reactions done by Haddadin et al.17

DIQ3 and Related Derivatives Reduce the Viability
of Human Colon Cancer HCT116 Cell Line in 2D in Vitro Models at Doses
That Are Not Cytotoxic to Normal FHs74Int Cells
To assess
the antitumor effect of compound DIQ3 and its related
derivatives (DIQ4-6) on human colon cancer HCT116 cell
lines, we employed the MTT assay. The MTT results revealed
that all drugs were capable of significantly inhibiting the metabolic
activity of the colon cancer cells. DIQ3 and its related
derivatives inhibited the viability of HCT116 even at pharmacologically
achievable micromole concentrations in a time- and dose-dependent
manner (Figure 2).
Interestingly, a DIQ3 concentration as low as 4 μM
was able to inhibit cell viability by approximately more than 50%
at 24 h. It is worth noting that the toxicity of varying concentrations
(1–10 μM) of DIQ3 and related derivatives
was investigated in FHs74Int cells derived from normal human fetal
intestinal tissue by MTT assay. Interestingly, DIQ3 and
related derivatives had relatively limited toxicity when applied at
doses up to 5 μM and over a 72 h period (Figure 3).

Figure 2 DIQ3 and related derivatives reduce
the viability
of HCT116 cell line as assessed by MTT. The antitumor effect of different
concentrations of DIQ3 and its related derivatives (compounds DIQ4-6) on the viability of HCT116 cells was determined in
sextuplicates at 24, 48, and 72 h using MTT assay. Results are expressed
as percent of control. The data are reported as mean of n = 2 ± SEM (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 using Student’s t-test).

Figure 3 DIQ3 and related derivatives (DIQ4-6)
had relatively limited toxicity on the viability of FHs74Int cell
line as assessed by MTT for doses up to 5 μM. Experiment was
performed in sextuplicates for each condition. Results are expressed
as percent of control. The data are reported as mean of n = 2 ± SEM (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 using Student’s t-test).

DIQ3 Targets
an Enriched Population of Colon Cancer
Stem/Progenitor Cells
The ability to grow as nonadherent
spheroids has been widely used to assess the self-renewal capability
of CSCs. We investigated colonosphere formation of HCT116 cells, a
salient feature of CSCs. To better visualize their sphere-forming
capabilities in 3D cultures, HCT116 cells were cultured as single
cells in Matrigel for 11 days in the presence and absence of compound DIQ3 or its derivatives. The spheres were then visualized
under an inverted light microscope and bright-field images were taken
(Figure 4). Our data
showed that HCT116 had a unique population of sphere-forming cells,
suggesting the presence of cells with stem cell-like properties. Notably,
the sphere-forming unit (SFU) was always lower in drug-treated cells
compared with that of the control condition in a dose-dependent manner.
Interestingly, the percent of spheres decreased to about 50% at 0.1
μM of DIQ3 and complete inhibition of sphere formation
was achieved in wells treated with 1 μM of the compounds (Figure 5).

related derivatives inhibit size and number

density of 2000 cells/well. Images were visualized by Axiovert inverted
microscope at 20X magnification and analyzed by Carl Zeiss Zen 2012
image software.

Figure 5 Effect of DIQ3 and its related derivatives (DIQ4-6) on inhibiting
the self-renewal ability of the HCT116
colon cancer cells in generation 1. Cells were cultured in Matrigel
at a density of 2000 cells/well for 11 days. The generated spheres
are referred to as G1 (generation 1) spheres. These spheres
were treated in duplicates with increasing concentrations of the drugs
(0.01, 0.1, 1 μM) or media (Ctr). Media or treatment was replenished
every 2 days. Spheres were counted by phase contrast microscopy at
day 11 of sphere culture. Results are expressed as SFU which is calculated
according to the following formula: SFU = (number of spheres counted
× (100)/number of input cells). The data were reported as mean
of n = 2 ± SEM (*P < 0.05
using the Student’s t-test).

We assessed the presence of stem cell markers in
3-D Matrigel culture
within the HCT116 cell populations. Immunofluorescence staining showed
high expression of CD44, CD133, and EpCAM in control HCT116 spheres
at G1 (Figure 6) indicating enriched stemness in these cells. To understand
the mechanism of inhibition of colon sphere formation by DIQ3, we evaluated sphere proliferation by Ki67 expression and DNA apoptotic
fragmentation using a Tunel assay (Figure 7). It appeared that the mechanism of inhibition
of colon sphere formation was mainly due to inhibition of proliferation
because colon spheres that were formed in the presence of DIQ3 had much lower Ki67 staining and were much smaller in size compared
with the control. Treatment with 0.5 μM DIQ3 also
showed Tunel-positive cells in HCT16 colon spheres as compared to
the control (Figure 7).

Conclusions
Diminoquinone compounds (DIQ3-6) have been widely
investigated as potent anticancer agents. On the basis of the promising
anticancer activity of DIQ3, we were interested in studying
its antitumor properties in 2D and 3D models. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to investigate the synthesis of these components
and the effect of DIQ3 on colon cancer cells with stem-like
properties.

Recent growing evidence suggests that the tumor
has a specialized
malignant cell population, characterized by self-renewing, multipotent,
and tumor initiating properties, which drives tumor development. This
subpopulation is referred to as cancer stem-like cells, which are
generated from normal stem or precursor cells within tissues after
mutations occur.18 Discovery of these CSCs
has provided a new insight into carcinogenesis where this highly resistant
population can be held accountable for uncontrolled growth, relapse,
and metastasis. We evaluated the ability of DIQ3 to target
the subpopulation of stem/progenitor cells in HCT116 cells using a
3D sphere formation assay. Remarkably, treatment with DIQ3 at a concentration as low as 0.1 μM inhibited significantly
the SFU. This suggests that the therapeutic effect of DIQ3 is exerted via targeting the CSCs. Our current findings make DIQ3 and its derivatives somewhat selective, which is the
most essential aspect sought after in chemotherapeutic drugs. Thus,
this study will provide the basis for proposing DIQ3 as
a nontoxic and stable compound for additional testing.

Materials and
Methods
General Procedures and Reagents
Melting points were
determined using the DigiMelt apparatus and were uncorrected. NMR
spectra were determined in deuterated DMSO on a Bruker AM 500 NMR
spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm (δ). Infrared
spectra were recorded using Thermo Scientific iD3 ATR for Nicolet
iS5 FT-IR spectrometer. The IR bands are reported as wave numbers
(cm–1). TLC was performed on TLC Silica gel 60 F254
(used directly as received). For high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS),
the samples were analyzed by flow-injection analysis on a Thermo Fisher
Scientific LTQ Orbitrap (San Jose, CA) operated in the centroid mode.
The samples were injected into a mixture of 50% MeOH/H2O and 0.1% formic acid at a flow of 0.2 mL/min. Source parameters
were 5.5 kV spray voltage, capillary temperature of 275 °C, and
sheath gas setting of 20. Spectral data were acquired at a resolution
of 100 000 full width at half-maximum with the lock mass feature,
which typically results in sufficient mass accuracy.

The starting
materials used were commercially available and purchased from standard
chemical suppliers.

The different analogs of DIQ were synthesized in a
similar manner (see Supporting Information).

Cell Culture and Treatment
HCT116 cell lines (ATCC,
USA) were cultured and maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, UK)
with 20 mM HEPES and l-glutamine. Cells were maintained in
an incubator at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cell culture media was supplemented with antibiotics
[1% penicillin–streptomycin (100 U/mL)], 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), and 5 μg/mL
Plasmocin prophylactic (InvivoGen). FHs74Int, normal human fetal intestinal
cell line, was grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium with 10% FBS at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were
incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Stocks of the compounds DIQ3-6 were prepared
by dissolving 5 mg in 1 mL of DMSO. Dilutions were prepared such that
the percentage of DMSO on cells was less than 0.1%.

MTT Assay
The effects of compounds DIQ3-6 on cell viability
was measured in vitro using the MTT ([3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide]) assay. Colon cancer and normal FHs74Int cells were plated
in 96-well culture plates at 5 × 103 cells/well and
incubated overnight and then treated in sextuplicates with 0.1% DMSO
or different concentrations of compounds DIQ3-6 for 24,
48, or 72 h. For each time point, 10 μL of 5 mg/mL (in 1×
PBS) MTT reagent was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C
for 4 h, after which 100 μL of solubilizing solution was added.
After overnight incubation, the reduced MTT optical density was measured
at a wavelength of 595 nm using an ELISA reader (Multiskan Ex). The
percentage of viable cells was determined for each drug concentration
with respect to untreated cells and is represented as mean ±
standard error of the mean (SEM).

3D Culture and Sphere-Formation
Assay
This assay was
performed according to the protocol previously described.19−21 2000 cells/well were suspended in cold Matrigel/serum-free medium
(1:1) in a total volume of 50 μL. HCT116 cells were seeded uniformly
in a circular manner around the bottom rim of the well and allowed
to solidify in the incubator at 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequently,
0.5 mL of low-serum media treated with compounds DIQ3-6 or DMSO was added gently in the middle of each well. Spheres were
replenished with warm media as in the original seeding every other
day. Spheres were counted after 10–13 days. To propagate spheres,
the medium was aspirated and Matrigel was digested with 0.5 mL of
1 mg/mL dispase solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), dissolved in
serum-free medium for 60 min at 37 °C. Spheres were then collected
and incubated in 1 mL warm trypsin/EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min and
then passed through a 20, 25, and 27-gauge syringes three times. Cells
were counted using a hemocytometer and re-seeded as described above.
The sphere-formation unit (SFU) was calculated for each generation
as follows: SFU = (number of spheres formed/number of cells plated)
× 100. Results were represented as a percentage of the SFU of
the treated spheres compared with the untreated ones. Zeiss Axiovert
microscope was used for the acquisition of bright field images.

Tunel Assay
Spheres were collected between days 10
and 13 and fixed for 15 min at 15–25 °C. Spheres were
incubated overnight in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. The next day, spheres
were washed with PBS and then incubated in 50 μL/condition Tunel
reaction mixture for 60 min at room temperature. After embedding the
stained spheres with antifade, a Carl Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning
confocal microscope was used for immunofluorescence analysis.

Immunofluorescence
Staining
Collected spheres were
immunostained with primary mouse monoclonal anti-Ki67 (1/150 dilution)
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) and secondary Alexa 488 goat
anti-mouse (Invitrogen, CA) antibody. Spheres were mounted with the
anti-fade Fluoro-gel II with Dapi. Confocal microscopic analyses were
performed using a Carl Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope
and images were acquired and analyzed using the Carl Zeiss ZEN 2012
image software.

Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed
using the Student’s t-test. P-values of p <
0.05 (*) and p < 0.01 (**) were considered significant
and highly significant, respectively. Results are presented as the
mean ± standard error (SEM).
