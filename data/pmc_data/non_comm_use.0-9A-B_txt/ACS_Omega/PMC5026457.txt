Gold patchy nanoparticles (PPs) were
prepared under surfactant-free
conditions by functionalization with a binary ligand mixture of polystyrene
and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as hydrophobic and hydrophilic ligands,
respectively. The interfacial activity of PPs was compared to that
of homogeneous hydrophilic nanoparticles (HPs), fully functionalized
with PEG, by means of pendant drop tensiometry at water/air and water/decane
interfaces. We compared interfacial activities in three different
spreading agents: water, water/chloroform, and pure chloroform. We
found that the interfacial activity of PPs was close to zero (∼2
mN/m) when the spreading agent was water and increased to ∼14
mN/m when the spreading agent was water/chloroform. When the nanoparticles
were deposited with pure chloroform, the interfacial activity reached
up to 60 mN/m by compression. In all cases, PPs exhibited higher interfacial
activity than HPs, which were not interfacially active, regardless
of the spreading agent. The interfacial activity at the water/decane
interface was found to be significantly lower than that at the water/air
interface because PPs aggregate in decane. Interfacial dilatational
rheology showed that PPs form a stronger elastic shell at the pendant
drop interface, compared to HPs. The significantly high interfacial
activity obtained with PPs in this study highlights the importance
of the polymeric patchy shell and the spreading agent.

Introduction
Gold nanoparticles
displaying interfacial activity are extensively
studied as emulsion stabilizers due to the combination of the benefits
of Pickering emulsions1,2 and the plasmonic features of
the Au cores.3 One way to obtain this interfacial
activity is to functionalize the nanoparticles with two different
ligands with different wettabilities. If these ligands become segregated
at the interface, the nanoparticle becomes a patchy nanoparticle (PP).4−7 The presence of such patches of different wettabilities at the interface
improves the ability of these nanoparticles to stabilize emulsions
because of the spatial separation between the different wettability
domains.8 Moreover, it is possible to fine-control
multiple anisotropy dimensions in such PPs,9 which can lead to an anisotropic surface chemistry.10 In the extreme case of only two domains of different wettabilities
at the interface, a Janus nanoparticle (JP) is obtained and this spatial
separation leads to enhanced interfacial activity as compared to homogeneous
nanoparticles.8,11 In fact, JPs have been predicted
to show up to 3 times higher adsorption energy than their homogeneous
counterparts, with randomly distributed capping ligands,8 and even to produce thermodynamically stable
Pickering emulsions.12 These are not two
exclusive synthesis paths; more complex synthesis can mix Janus and
patchy morphologies in the same nanoparticle.13 Thus, regardless of the Janus or patchy configuration, it is necessary
to understand the role of the capping ligands that constitute the
separate wettability domains of such JPs or PPs in their interfacial
activity.14

Gold nanoparticles with
thiol-terminated poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) chains and short alkanethiols as capping ligands are efficient
water/oil emulsion stabilizers.1 Previous
attempts to obtain gold nanoparticles functionalized by PEG and PS
were made by Zubarev et al.,15 where 2
nm diameter gold and silver cores were functionalized by V-shaped
PS-b-PEG diblock copolymers. Janus gold nanoparticles
can also be obtained through the spontaneous segregation of two dissimilar
polymers on the surface of the nanoparticle. The Janus character of
these JPs was assessed by nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-NMR
(NOESY-NMR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tomography
images upon selective staining. As one hemisphere is coated with a
hydrophilic polymer (polyethylene glycol (PEG)) and the other with
a hydrophobic one (polystyrene (PS)), the nanoparticles can assemble
into clusters with sizes that can be tuned by alterations in several
parameters such as polymer length, polymer ratio, core size, and polarity
of the medium.4

Interestingly, the
spreading agent also plays a major role when
the nanoparticles are deposited at fluid interfaces. This is because
the evaporation of volatile spreading agents provides energy to the
nanoparticles to reach and anchor at the interface. This process forms
the so-called Langmuir monolayer, in contrast to a Gibbs monolayer
in which the nanoparticles have to reach the interface from the bulk.
The latter process is very slow as compared to the usual laboratory
timescales and thus impractical in industrial processes.14

We present here an analysis of the importance
of the polymeric
capping ligands in gold nanoparticles, the size of the core, and the
spreading agent used during the deposition at water/air and water/decane
interfaces. We used pendant drop tensiometry to compare the interfacial
activity of gold PPs of 13 and 23 nm nanoparticles functionalized
with PS (2 kDa) and PEG (1 kDa) with that of homogeneous nanoparticles
functionalized with PEG only. The role of the spreading agent was
studied by comparing the behavior in pure water, water/CHCl3, and pure CHCl3. Finally, particle-laden interfaces were
studied by interfacial dilatational rheology to study the microstructure
of the nanoparticles at the pendant drop interface.

Methods
Preparation
of PPs
The nanoparticles investigated in
this study were prepared by using the methodology reported in ref (4). In brief, gold nanoparticles
were synthesized by reduction of HAuCl4 by sodium citrate
and were then added to a solution of thiol-terminated polymers for
coating. Whereas for the synthesis of hydrophilic nanoparticles (HPs)
an aqueous solution of PEG-SH or PS-SH was used, PPs were obtained
with an equimolar mixture of PEG-SH and PS-SH in tetrahydrofuran (THF).
The main difference between the preparation of the nanoparticles in
this study and that in ref (4) was the purification process. To guarantee that no traces
of citrate, free polymer, or THF remained in the sample, centrifugation
and supernatant exchange were repeated 5-fold in this study. No impurities
with significant surface activity were observed.

Characterization
of Nanoparticles
As described in ref (4), the NOESY-NMR spectra
(NOESY, Bruker 500 MHz spectrophotometer) of the nanoparticles synthesized
with the equimolar mixture of PEG-SH of 1 kDa and PS-SH of 2 kDa revealed
a significant segregation of the polymers at the nanoparticle surface,
that is, a patchy morphology. These nanoparticles were characterized
by TEM (JEOL 2010F FEG-TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Malvern
Zetasizer Nano) to obtain information regarding the sizes of individual
nanoparticles and their assemblies in bulk solution. Table 1 summarizes the obtained results
where the occurrence of aggregation in bulk refers to the formation
of clusters in each corresponding solvent. The homogeneous nanoparticles
functionalized by PS-SH were too hydrophobic to be dispersed in water.
Thus, we considered only the Janus and hydrophilic homogeneous nanoparticles.
Both hydrophilic homogeneous and PPs were negatively charged when
dispersed in water, whereas the hydrophobic homogeneous nanoparticles
could not be measured in water.

The core size of the hydrophobic
PS-capped nanoparticles was 17
± 3 nm (by TEM) and the core plus polymeric shell size was 30
± 4 nm (by DLS) in organic solvents (CHCl3 and THF).

Electron microscopy analyses with either staining or chemical modification
of the PEG-patch revealed that the polymeric shell assumes a Janus
configuration for various pairs of polymers (PEG 5 kDa + PS 2 kDa
and PEG 1 kDa + PNIPAM 1.2 kDa in different proportions).4 However, due to the assembly of nanoparticles
coated by PEG 1 kDa + PS 2 kDa in water, it was not possible to apply
the same analysis for the system of this study. Therefore, we can
only confirm that PEG 1 kDa and PS 2 kDa are segregated on the nanoparticle
surface in a patchy conformation.

Pendant Drop Tensiometry
We used a homemade setup described
in a previous report.16 We started by depositing
a given amount of nanoparticle dispersion with a microsyringe on a
20 μL Milli-Q water pendant drop in air. Next, the pendant drop
volume was increased up to 45 μL and the surface tension was
monitored while keeping the drop volume constant over time. The fall
of the pendant drop due to low-tension values was prevented using
a bigger poly(tetrafluoroethylene) capillary with a cap (with external
diameters of 2.8 and 4.2 mm for the capillary and the cap, respectively,
see Figure 1). We monitored
the surface tension (γ) over time for these experiments.

Figure 1 (A) Water pendant
drop (20 μL) in air with 5.9 × 109 PPs of 23
nm diameter deposited using CHCl3 as
the spreading agent. Note the CHCl3 on the bottom of the
pendant drop indicated by the red circle. (B) Water pendant drop (45
μL); the same pendant drop as in (A); after evaporation of CHCl3, this pendant drop fell off because of the low surface tension.

After 20 min, the surface tension
was stable over time in most
cases. Next, we performed growing and shrinking cycles in air by varying
the total volume of the drop between 45 and 15 μL at the lowest
rate possible with our setup, 0.08 μL/s. When pure CHCl3 was used as the spreading solvent, the evaporation process
was violent and completed in a few seconds (see Figure 1). When water/CHCl3 was used as
the spreading agent, half of the microsyringe was loaded with the
aqueous nanoparticle dispersion and half with CHCl3. We
also performed growing and shrinking experiments at the water/decane
interface by shrinking the pendant drop to 10 μL, immersing
in decane, and then growing again up to 45 μL. Finally, the
same growing and shrinking cycles were performed in contact with the
decane phase. For these experiments, the surface pressure was plotted,
defined as Π = γ0 – γ, where γ0 is 72.5 and 52.3 mN/m for water/air and water/decane interfaces,
respectively, and γ is the surface tension measured with nanoparticles.
The surface pressure was plotted against either the pendant drop area
or the area per particle Ap (the area
of the pendant drop divided by the number of deposited nanoparticles).

Dilatational interfacial rheology was carried out as described
in a previous work,17 by growing and shrinking
the pendant drop at different periods with a fixed 1 μL amplitude.
From the differences in amplitude and phase of the input volume oscillation
and the output surface tension, it is possible to obtain the interfacial
elastic modulus Ed and viscosity ηd, in analogy to the storage and loss moduli in three-dimensional
rheology.

Results and Discussion
Effect of the Spreading
Agent
The role of the spreading
agent was studied by depositing a given amount of 13 nm PPs at the
water/air interface. Experiments were carried out using either only
water as the solvent or loading the microsyringe half with the aqueous
nanoparticle dispersion and half with chloroform (CHCl3). The interfacial activity was determined to be close to zero (∼2
mN/m for the highest compression state) when the aqueous colloid was
deposited (see Figure 2), whereas it increased up to ∼14 mN/m when water/CHCl3 was used as the spreading solvent. The absence of surface-active
impurities in the CHCl3 used as the spreading agent was
confirmed, as shown in the black curve in Figure 2a, which corresponds to the deposition of
5 μL of pure CHCl3. Chloroform was selected as the
spreading agent due to an effect observed when the PPs were dispersed
in CHCl3 and water was added to the dispersion. As chloroform
and water are immiscible and the former is denser, the addition of
water generates an upper phase. Interestingly, a metallic gold-like
layer was observed at the interface when PPs were present in the bottom
phase (see Figure 3), indicating that they tend to self-assemble at the CHCl3/water interface. The golden layer, which only occurs with PPs at
the CHCl3/water interface, may be pointing out that their
interfacial activity produces a high population at the interface,
with a high interfacial pressure. A study of this interface at the
pendant drop would help explain this effect better. However, the formation
of a chloroform pendant drop in water produced a profile not analyzable
by axisymmetric drop shape analysis (see Figure S1). On the other hand, HPs did not display this assembly behavior.
From this observation, we expected that chloroform would be an efficient
spreading agent for this system. The observed interfacial activity
difference can be explained in terms of the formation of a Langmuir
monolayer versus a Gibbs monolayer.14 When
PPs are deposited from water, they join the water subphase and a Gibbs
monolayer is formed by which PPs reach the pendant drop interface
very slowly.14 This is especially unfavorable
for nanoparticles with sizes of a few nanometers in which the adsorption
energy is in the range of kBT.18 In contrast, when water/CHCl3 is used as the spreading agent, the abrupt evaporation of CHCl3 promotes the formation of a Langmuir monolayer in which the
nanoparticles can reach the interface at a much faster rate, which
is evidenced by the stable surface tension, as shown in Figure 2a. Concerning the comparison
of interfacial activity between homogeneous and PPs, 13 nm HPs showed
no interfacial activity compared to 13 nm PPs (see Figure 2a,b), even for higher concentrations
of 13 nm HPs and while using water/CHCl3 as the spreading
agent. As PS ligands are hydrophobic but PEG is hydrophilic, 13 nm
HPs functionalized only with PEG are expected to be more hydrophilic
and tend to stay in the water subphase, provided the hydrodynamic
radius in water obtained by DLS for HPs in Table 1. On the other hand, the interfacial activity
of the 13 nm PPs is expected to arise from the patchy character of
these nanoparticles with hydrophobic PS domains. Although the HPs
show a very low interfacial activity that might be caused by either
pollution or particle size, it is clear that the surface tension and
surface pressure upon compression are significantly lower than those
corresponding to PPs. Both PPs and HPs are not enough to provide a
close-packed monolayer; however, in the case of PPs deposited with
half chloroform, the higher interfacial activity may be explained
in terms of a percolating network of aggregates at the interface that
increase the surface pressure upon compression of the interface.

The black curve in (A) corresponds to the evaporation of pure CHCl3 deposited at the interface to test the purity of the spreading
solvent.

in the presence of an extra upper water phase (B). The interface between
both phases does not change color for homogeneous nanoparticles (A),
but it becomes golden-like for PPs (C). The insets show top views
of the same samples in square cuvettes.

Nanoparticles Dispersed in an Organic Solvent
We additionally explored the possibility
of increasing the interfacial activity by redispersing the PPs in
pure CHCl3 and increasing their size. The nanoparticle
size is an important factor in the interfacial adhesion energy Eads at interfaces, which follows eq 1,8 where R is the radius of the particle, γ12 is
the surface tension of the bare fluid–fluid interface, and
θ12 is the three-phase contact angle. 1  Eads ∝ R2 is more than
3 times higher for 23 nm nanoparticles
than for 13 nm nanoparticles. Therefore, bigger nanoparticles are
expected to be more firmly anchored at the interface. If we use eq 1 with γ12 = 72.5 mN/m for the water/air interface and we consider θ12 = 90° (to provide the highest Eads), Eads = 2341 kT for the 13
nm nanoparticles and 7329 kT for the 23 nm nanoparticles, at T = 25 °C. Thus, if we consider the high energy of
adsorption of the nanoparticles and the fact that we are providing
extra energy from the violent process of evaporation of the spreading
solvent, it might be plausible to consider that all nanoparticles
became placed at the interface, while we do not know exactly the microstructure.
We first characterized the water/air interface, as shown in Figure 4. The black curve
in Figure 4a corresponds
to the supernatant obtained after centrifugation of the 23 nm PPs
at 5500g for 30 min in a glass tube (to avoid CHCl3 from dissolving the plastic centrifugation tube). It can
be seen that the supernatant was clean, therefore recovering the interfacial
activity of a bare water/air interface (∼72.5 mN/m). This indicates
that the redispersion in CHCl3 did not lead to desorption
of the polymers or contaminate the nanoparticle dispersion. Figure 4a shows that the
final stable surface tension after CHCl3 evaporation increased
with the concentration of 23 nm PPs and was reproducible for two separate
runs (solid and dashed lines for each color in Figure 4a), whereas 23 nm HPs dispersed in water
exhibited no interfacial activity for even higher concentrations,
as expected. Thus, 23 nm HPs serve as a control case for nanoparticles
with no interfacial activity. In Figure 4b, the growing and shrinking cycles performed
for the different initial concentrations enabled building of a piecewise-like
compression isotherm (see Figure S2 to
see pictures of the pendant drops). At high values of surface area
between 8 × 104 nm2/particle and 14 ×
104 nm2/particle, the surface pressure Π
starts at zero and increases upon decreasing Ap (i.e., increasing the compression state) up to ∼60
mN/m, which is the highest reported surface pressure with nanometer-sized
gold PPs, to the best of our knowledge. This value is significantly
higher than the maximum value Π ∼ 20 mN/m reported with
4 nm gold true JPs half-functionalized with hexanethiol and half with
2-(2-mercapto-ethoxy)ethanol and dispersed in THF,17 which is a special case of 2-patch nanoparticles. Therefore,
the realization of a Langmuir monolayer by PPs is demonstrated. Additionally,
a change in the slope is visible in Figure 4b, around Ap =
104 nm2/particle, which has also been reported
for silver JPs by Fernández-Rodríguez et al.16 In the present case, we do not have enough particles
to obtain a close-packed monolayer, but it is likely that the change
in slope is due to nanoparticles coming in contact by percolating
domains in a fractal-like manner, as observed by several authors for
JPs.19,20

deposition of 23 nm PPs (squares) and HPs (circles) dispersed in CHCl3 (which is used as the spreading agent) at water/air interfaces.
(B) Surface pressure Π vs Ap of
the growing and shrinking cycles corresponding to the curves in (A).
The black curve in (A) corresponds to the evaporation of 1 μL
of the supernatant from 23 nm PPs dispersed in CHCl3 after
centrifugation, to test that the CHCl3 is not desorbing
the polymers from the 23 nm PPs.

Finally, the interfacial activity of 23 nm PPs is compared
to that
of 23 nm HPs for higher concentrations. As can be seen in Figure 4b, the 23 nm HPs
show no interfacial activity, as compared to the value of Π
∼ 60 mN/m for 23 nm PPs. This is a clear evidence that the
combination of size and polymers used to synthesize the 23 nm PPs
leads to a significantly higher interfacial activity than that of
homogeneous nanoparticles. Moreover, when we synthesized particles
with a bigger PEG of 5 kDa (results not shown), we never obtained
interfacial activity, either for HPs or for particles with two polymers
(PEG of 5 kDa and PS of 2 kDa), probably because the long PEG chains
render the nanoparticles significantly hydrophilic and very stable
in the aqueous bulk. The foamability of similar nanoparticles was
previously reported by Hunter and Jameson, who studied the adsorption
of 120 and 300 nm PS nanoparticles functionalized by PEG monomethacrylate
(PEGMA) at the water/air interface,21 so
that PEGMA functionalization provided steric stabilization to the
nanoparticles. The highest surface pressure obtained for the 300 nm
particles greatly depended on the pH of the water subphase: 27 mN/m
for pH 2 and 7 mN/m for pH 6, because these nanoparticles are strongly
positively charged at pH 2, and uncharged at pH 6 (producing aggregation
of the nanoparticles). A similar behavior was found for the 120 nm
nanoparticles (22–25 mN/m at pH 2). These nanoparticles showed
a good ability to produce foams, with good agreement between the Langmuir
trough experiments at the water/air interface and the foaming behavior:
lower pH leads to stronger adsorption and formation of a more robust
steric barrier. Nevertheless, our 23 nm PPs present a clearly enhanced
interfacial activity, which points out the importance of choosing
the right polymers and the right solvents.

Interfacial Dilatational
Rheology
One way to study
the microstructure of the nanoparticles deposited at the pendant drop
interface is to perform interfacial dilatational rheology experiments,
from which we can see the response of the nanoparticles at the pendant
drop interface toward periodic increments and reductions of the available Ap. Figure 5 shows that Ed is of 1
order of magnitude larger than ηd for each Ap studied, pointing out a solid elastic-shell
behavior. Ed decreases and ηd increases with the period because for higher periods, the
perturbation is lower and the surface shows less elastic behavior.
There is a clear trend of increasing Ed and ηd for decreasing Ap for the 23 nm PPs, showing the elastic-shell behavior that becomes
more important as there are more particles per unit of area. On the
other hand, the 23 nm HPs at higher concentrations show once more
no interfacial activity through lack of elasticity and viscosity,
similar to a bare water/air interface. This elastic-shell behavior
in which the elastic modulus increases from 25 up to 450 mN/m points
out the interfacial activity of PPs and their capability as foam stabilizers
(see Figure S3 to see drop pictures during
the interfacial dilatational rheology).

elastic modulus (Ed) and (B) viscosity
(ηd) of 23 nm PPs
(squares) and HPs (circles) dispersed in CHCl3 against
different periods for different Ap compression
states at the water/air interface.

Surface Tension at the Liquid/Liquid Interface
The
interfacial activity at liquid/liquid interfaces was studied by immersing
the pendant drop in decane for the highest concentrations measured
with 23 nm PPs (see Figure 6). The interfacial activity of the pendant drop immersed in
decane is close to zero. No interfacial activity was observed for
the 23 nm HPs both at water/air and at water/decane interfaces. The
immersion of the pendant drop in decane is likely to produce aggregation
of the nanoparticles, leading to a low interfacial activity in water/decane
compared to water/air interfaces. However, from previous works with
a similar methodology and true Janus gold nanoparticles (4 nm diameter;
functionalized with hexanethiol and mercaptoethoxyethanol),17 similar values of surface tension were measured
at water/air and water/decane interfaces for similar Ap. Thus, the difference of interfacial activity of 23
nm PPs at water/air and water/decane interfaces is expected to arise
from either the particle size or the polymers. From eq 1, Eads is calculated to be 33 times higher for 23 nm gold nanoparticles
than for 4 nm nanoparticles in ref (17), and therefore the bigger particles are expected
to better withstand the immersion in decane. This suggests that the
polymers are responsible for the interfacial activity differences
at water/air and water/decane interfaces. Transfer of the PPs into
decane was not successful, as they irreversibly aggregated and precipitated.
Thus, the aggregation hypothesis is the most likely one. In any case,
this is evidence that not all nanoparticles that show a high interfacial
activity at water/air interfaces also show a high interfacial activity
at water/oil interfaces (see Figure S4 to
see a comparison between the water drops in air and after immersion
in decane).

Figure 6 Π vs Ap for the growing and shrinking
cycles of 23 nm PPs (squares) and HPs (circles) dispersed in CHCl3 at water/air (solid lines) and water/decane (dashed lines)
interfaces. Note that for the red squares, the upper curve corresponds
to shrinking, whereas the lower curve corresponds to the growth of
the pendant drop.

This behavior was reproduced
by using interfacial dilatational
rheology (Figure 7),
showing that elasticity and viscosity are always greater for water/air
(solid lines) than for water/decane interfaces (dashed lines). Moreover,
for water/air interfaces, when the pendant drop is shrunk, the elasticity
and viscosity increase significantly as explained above.

(B) viscosity (ηd) of 23 nm PPs
and HPs dispersed in CHCl3 against different periods for
different Ap compression states at the
water/air (solid lines) and water/decane (dashed lines) interfaces.

To better understand the microstructure
of fluid interfaces covered
with functionalized gold nanoparticles it would be necessary to employ
techniques such as X-rays or electron diffraction.22−25 In particular, these ultrafast
techniques would provide new insights into the microstructure at the
interface in out-of-equilibrium conditions.

Conclusions
The interfacial activity of gold PPs in the range 13–23
nm, synthesized under surfactant-free conditions, was studied by pendant
drop tensiometry. The particles are functionalized with PS (2 kDa)
and PEG (1 kDa) as hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers presenting
a patchy morphology at the surface, respectively. Homogeneous HPs
fully functionalized with PEG were synthesized to compare the interfacial
activity with the corresponding PPs. The HPs exhibited no interfacial
activity compared to the PPs, pointing out the ability of the latter
as better foam stabilizers. Moreover, we tested the efficiency of
water, a water/CHCl3 mixture and pure CHCl3 as
spreading agents, and the better spreading agent was pure CHCl3 reaching surface pressure values of 60 mN/m at the water/air
interface. Under these conditions, the water/air interface behaved
as an elastic shell, which additionally pointed out the ability of
these PPs as foam stabilizers. Finally, the interfacial activity was
found to be close to zero when the pendant drops were immersed in
decane, which might be due to irreversible aggregation of the nanoparticles
during immersion in decane. Thus, the roles of the polymers and spreading
agent were revealed to be crucial when PPs with high interfacial activity
are to be spread on a specific interface.
