The
kinetics and mechanism of hexachloroiridate(IV) oxidation of
chondroitin-4-sulfate as a sustainable coordination biopolymer macromolecule
(CS) in aqueous acidic solutions at a constant ionic strength of 0.1
mol dm–3 has been investigated spectrophotometrically.
Pseudo first-order plots gave sigmoidal curves of S-shape nature,
indicating that the kinetics is complex. Two distinct stages have
been observed. The first stage was relatively fast corresponding to
the autoacceleration period, followed by a slow stage which became
linear at a longer time period called the induction period. First-order
dependence with respect to the [OX] and fractional first order in
[CS] was observed for both stages. Kinetic evidence for formation
of the 1:1 intermediate complex within the two stages has been revealed.
The influence of [H+] on the rate constants indicated that
the oxidation was of acid inhibition nature. The kinetic parameters
have been evaluated, and a suitable reaction mechanism is suggested
and discussed in terms of the nature of the electron-transfer process.

1 Introduction
Study of electron-transfer
processes in macromolecules, in particular
sustainable coordination natural polymers, is considered as a new
criterion in the field of kinetic research.1,2

Chondroitin-4-sulfate (CS) is a natural polymer that belongs to
sulfated polysaccharides. It is composed of a chain of alternating
sugars (N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid).3 It is usually found to be attached to the proteins
as a part of proteoglycan as a carrier for heparin. The nature of
polysaccharides including the CS substrate as water-soluble, sustainable,
and biodegradable natural polymers makes this kind of polymers of
high importance from environmental and medical points of view.4,5 Therefore, it has a wide therapeutic application owing to its high
anticoagulant and antithrombotic activity.3−7 Recently, the CS substrate has been successfully
applied as an inhibitor for metal corrosion because of its safety,
low cost, nontoxicity, nondegradability, and ecofriendly characterizations.8

The literature survey indicated that a
few reports have been published
on the oxidation kinetics of sulfated macromolecules,9 in particular chondroitin-4-sulfate. This fact may be attributed
to the complex kinetic study of oxidation. However, the kinetics of
oxidation of CS by a multiequivalent oxidant such as chromic acid9 and a one-equivalent oxidant such as hexacyanoferrate(III)10 has been reported earlier. A lack of information
on the nature of the electron-transfer mechanism and transition states
in the rate-determining steps for redox systems involving the CS substrate
is recognized, which makes the kinetics and mechanistics of the electron-transfer
process remains not complete and poor understand.

Preliminary
experiments on the oxidation of CS by [IrCl6]2– in aqueous solutions indicated that the kinetics
were of complex nature and behave in a different trend from that studied
by the other oxidants.9,10

In view of the above argument
and our interest in the oxidation
of either sustainable natural polymers such as polysaccharides,11−17 in particular chondroitin-4-sulfate,9,10 or synthetic
polymer such as poly(vinyl alcohol)18 by
various oxidants, we have prompted to undertake the present investigation
of oxidation of CS by hexachloroiridate(IV) as an inert oxidant of
one-equivalent nature with the aim at shedding more light on the oxidation
kinetics in terms of the nature of electron transfer and transition
states in the rate-determining step with special focus on the influence
of the molar concentration ratio of reactants on the nature of oxidation
products. Moreover, a novel synthesis of keto-acid derivatives as
a renewal chelating agent for removal of toxic heavy metal ions from
contaminated matters or as an inhibitor for metal corrosion.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials and Preparations
Chondroitin-4-sulfate
(ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) was used without further purification. A stock
solution of CS was prepared by stepwise addition of the reagent powder
to doubly distilled water while vigorously stirring the solution to
avoid the formation of aggregates, which swell with difficulty as
described earlier.9,10 The measured viscosity using
an Ubbelohde viscometer was found to be 1.12 dL/g for the reduced
viscosity and 3.11 dL/g for the inherent viscosity, respectively,
for 5% solution (w/v) in water at 25 °C.

Sodium hexachloroiridate(IV)
of Analar quality (Wako Chemical Reagent) was used without further
purification. Solutions of this reagent were freshly prepared before
each experiment to minimize the influence of the rate of aquation
of the formed labile hexachloroiridate(III).19,20 The measurements of optical density against concentration plots
for acidified [IrCl6]2– were fitted using
Beer’s law at wavelengths of 418 and 489 nm, where the molar
extinction coefficients were 3315 ± 16 and 4065 ± 20 dm3 mol–1 cm–1 at those two
wavelengths, respectively, which were found to be in good agreement
with the values reported elsewhere.21,22

Doubly
distilled conductivity water was used in all preparations.
The temperature was controlled within ±0.05 °C. The ionic
strength of the reaction mixtures was kept constant at a constant
0.1 mol dm–3 using NaClO4 as an inert
electrolyte.

All other reagents employed in the present work
were of analytical
grade and their solutions were prepared by dissolving the requisite
amount of the samples in doubly distilled water.

2.2 Kinetic Measurements
All kinetic
measurements were conducted under pseudo first-order conditions where
[CS] was present in a large excess over that of hexachloroiridate(IV)
concentration. The course of reaction was followed by recording the
decrease in absorbance of [IrCl6]2– at
a wavelength of 489 nm, its absorption maximum, as a function of time.
It was verified that there was no interference from other reagents
at this wavelength. This means that all other reagents do not absorb
significantly at this wavelength. The absorption measurements were
made in a thermostated cell compartment at the desired temperature
within ±0.05 °C on a Shimadzu UV-2101/3101 PC automatic
scanning double-beam spectrophotometer fitted with a wavelength program
controller using cells of pathlength 1.0 cm. The spectral changes
during the progress of the oxidation reaction are displayed in Figure 1.

nm) during the reaction progression

[IrCl6]2– = 2 × 10–4, [CS] = 3 × 10–2, [H+] = 1 ×
10–3, and I = 0.1 mol dm–3 at 40 °C. (Scanning time intervals = 1.0 min).

Some kinetic measurements were conducted under
second-order conditions
to check the producibility of the pseudo first-order kinetic data
obtained.

3 Results
3.1 Stoichiometry
Because this reaction
seems to be of noncomplementary nature as well as of complexity kinetics,
determination of the stoichiometry of the overall reaction becomes
greatly significant. The stoichiometry of this redox reaction was
performed by using reaction mixtures of different initial concentrations
of the two reactants at [H+] = 1 × 10–3 and I = 0.1 mol dm–3 equilibrated
in dark bottles away from light to avoid the photoreduction of [IrCl6]2–. The unreacted [IrCl6]2– was estimated periodically until it reached a constant
value, that is, reaction completion. The results of various ratios
of the equilibrated reactants indicate that 1 mol of CS consumed 8
± 0.1 mol of [IrCl6]2–. This result
indicates that the stoichiometry of the overall reaction conforms
to the following equation 1  where
C14H21NO14S– and
C14H15NO15S– are
corresponding to chondroitin-4-sulfate and
its diketo-acid oxidation precursor derivative, respectively. The
oxidation products were identified by elemental analysis and spectral
data as described earlier.9,10

Under our experimental
conditions of the presence of [CS] ≫ [IrCl6]2–, the product was identified as the monoketo-derivative
product of CS. This means that the product is dependent on the molar
ratios between the reactants as follows 2   3  where C14H19NO14S– and C14H17NO14S– represent monoketo- and diketo-derivatives of
oxidation of CS, respectively. These products could be separated and
identified as mentioned above.

3.2 Reaction
Time Curves
Pseudo first-order
plots [ln (absorbance) vs time] or second-order plots [1/(absorbance)
vs time] were much surprising which gave curves of inverted S-shape
nature, indicating that the oxidation kinetics are complex throughout
the entire course of reaction progression. At the early stages, the
rates were relatively fast, followed by slow stages which became linear
at longer time periods. This means that the oxidation reaction takes
place throughout two distinct stages, namely, autoacceleration and
induction periods, respectively. This behavior may obey to the following
rate law expression.23−27 4  where At and A∞ are the absorbances
at time t and infinity, respectively; P0 and B0 are the absorbance
change for
the fast and slow reacting species, respectively. The rate constants
for the autoacceleration period can be obtained by drawing a straight
line throughout the fast stage and extrapolating the line back to
zero time P0. The rate constant of the
induction period was obtained from plots of the form ln (At – A∞)(A∞ – At′) versus time. The quantity
(At – A∞) represents the experimental point
and (A∞ – At′) represents the extrapolating
point at time t′.28 A typical plot is shown in Figure 2. The values of pseudo first-order rate constants kf and ks for both
autoacceleration and induction periods were calculated by the method
of least-squares and are summarized in Table 1.

3.3 Dependence of the Reaction Rate on [IrCl6]2– and [CS]
The experimental results
indicated that both first-order rate constants (kf and ks) were independent
on the concentration of the oxidant in the range of (1–8) ×
10–4 mol dm–3. The results are
summarized in Table 1. This independency along with the linearity observed for pseudo
first-order plots (Figure 2) may confirm that the reaction is first order in [IrCl6]2– in both autoacceleration and induction
stages, respectively.

The dependence of observed first-order
rate constants kobs on the substrate concentration
(where kobs = kf or ks) was deduced from the measurements
of such observed pseudo first-order rate constants at various initial
concentrations of CS and fixed concentrations of all other reagents.
The nonconstancy values obtained from dividing kobs by [CS] indicates the fractional order with respect to
[CS]. The order in [CS] was evaluated from the relation (log rate
= n log[CS] plots).

Again, the double reciprocal
plots of kobs versus [CS] were found to
be linear with positive intercepts on
1/kobs axes in both two stages as shown
in Figure 3. This behavior
is indicative to the Michaelis–Menten kinetics for formation
of 1:1 intermediate complexes. The existence of two isobestic points
at wavelengths of about 390 and 320 nm during the reaction progression
(Figure 1) may confirm
the formation of such intermediate complexes. The Michaelis–Menten
constants were found to be 0.55 × 102 and 0.63 ×
102 dm3 mol–1 at 40 °C
for the autoacceleration and induction periods, respectively.

of CS by [IrCl6]2–. [IrCl6]2– = 2 × 10–4, [H+] = 1 × 10–3, and I = 0.1
mol dm–3 at 40 °C.

3.4 Dependence of the Reaction Rate on [H+]
Some kinetic runs were conducted in HClO4–NaClO4 solutions of different [H+]
and constants of all other reagent concentrations in order to examine
the influence of [H+] on the oxidation rates in order to
elucidate a suitable reaction mechanism. It was surprising to observe
a decrease in the rate constants with increasing the hydrogen ion
concentration because all alcoholic polysaccharides including the
CS substrate possess high tendency for protonation in acidic solutions.9 The experimental results showed an inverse fractional
order in [H+] in both two stages (Rate = [H+]n plots). Again, plots of observed pseudo
first-order rate constants against [H+]−1 gave curvature lines passing through the origin as shown in Figure 4a,b.

3.5 Dependence of the Reaction
Rate on Ionic Strength
Some kinetic runs were performed to
examine the influence of the
ionic strength on the reaction rates in order to shed some light on
the reactive species in the rate-determining steps; this takes place
by measuring the reaction rates with increasing the NaClO4 added at constant [H+] and fixed concentration of all
other reagents. It was found that the reaction rates (kf and ks) were decreased with
increasing the ionic strength. Plots of ln kobs versus either of √I or √I/1 + √I according to the Debye–Huckel
or extended Bronsted–Debye–Huckel equations were found
to be linear with negative slopes as shown in Figure 5a,b. However, the present measurements of
necessity lie outside the Bronsted–Debye–Huckel region,
covering a range over which the activity coefficients of many electrolytes
are known to be fairly dependent on the ionic strength. The ionic
strength dependence of the rate constants is qualitative as expected
when considering the charges involved in the present redox reaction.29

of CS by [IrCl6]2–. [IrCl6]2– = 2 × 10–4, [CS] = 3
× 10–2, and [H+] = 1 × 10–3 mol dm–3 at 40 °C.

3.6 Polymerization Test
Of course, the
intervention of free radicals throughout the course of reaction was
highly expected because the present reaction was of noncomplementary
type. Therefore, the possibility of free-radical formation has been
examined by adding 10% (v/v) of the acrylonitrile monomer to the partially
oxidizing reaction mixture. The failure of the polymerization test
after lapse of a long time period was much surprising which was found
to be on contrary to our expectation.30 Such a result will be discussed later.

3.7 Dependence
of the Reaction Rate on Temperature
Some experimental measurements
were performed at various temperatures
and fixed concentration of all other reagents in order to evaluate
the kinetic parameters of the rate constants. The rate constants (kf and ks) were found
to increase with increasing temperature and were fitting both Arrhenius
and Eyring equations for the temperature dependence of the rate constants.

4 Discussion
The experimental observations
in the present redox reactions indicated
that the behavior of reaction kinetics was complex with respect to
both autoacceleration (initial first stage) and induction periods
(slow second stage), respectively. This is because the plots of pseudo
first-order or second-order rate constants were deviated from linearity
and exhibited some curvature of inverted S-shape nature. This complicated
behavior may suggest the existence of either two consecutive first-order
reactions 5  or two parallel reactions as follows 6   7  where
the symbol kf and ks represent the observed
pseudo first-order rate constants (kobs and kobs′) in the two stages,
A and B; D and E are their respective reactants, respectively, and
C is the product.

The experimental kinetic results seem best
interpreted in favor
of the first type reaction pathway. This suggestion may be supported
by the observed curvature lines passing through the origin obtained
from the plots of kobs versus [H+]−1. However, the second reaction path cannot be
exclusively eliminated.

In view of the above interpretation
and the experimental observations
of the inverse first order in [H+] and the obedience of
the [CS] dependence of the reaction rates to the Michaelis–Menten
kinetics for formation of 1:1 intermediate complexes, the most suitable
reaction mechanism to be suggested should involve the release of protons
from at least one of the reaction paths prior to the rate-determining
step. This suggestion is supported by the observed protons released
in the stoichiometric equations.1−3 Because hexachloroiridate(IV)
is known to be extremely inert,31 then,
the CS substrate is only responsible for releasing such protons.

All alcoholic polysaccharides involving chondroitin-4-sulfate are
known to have a high tendency for either protonation in acidic solutions
to give the more reactive alkyloxonium ions14−18 8  or deprotonation in alkali
forming the more
reactive alkoxide ions11−13 9  where PS–OH represents alcoholic polysaccharides,
PS–OH2+ corresponds to alkyloxonium ions,
and PS–O– is the alkoxide ion, respectively.

Under our experimental conditions of lower acid concentrations
(0.5–4.0) × 10–3 mol dm–3 where the pHs ranging between 2.4 and 3.3, the possibility of protonation
of CS may be negligibly small. Hence, the most suitable reaction mechanism
which may be suggested involves the attack of the oxidant on the center
of the CS substrate, forming an intermediate complex C1 with subtracting a protonium ion by the water molecule prior to
the rate-determining step as follows 10  

This reaction is followed by the transfer of electrons from the
CS substrate to the oxidant in the rate-determining step to give a
substrate radical (C1•) and the reduced form of the oxidant (Red) as initial
oxidation products in the initial fast stage (autoacceleration period). 11  

Because the oxidant is of one-equivalent
nature, it needs to accept
only one electron to give its corresponding reduced form [IrCl6]3– (Red). This means that the rate-determining
step should involve the intervention of free radicals.

Therefore,
the delay of formation of free radicals in the polymerization
test during the progress of the oxidation process may be attributed
to either the rapid oxidation of the formed free radical compared
with its formation that could mask polymerization of acrylonitrile
or to the oxidation of the vinyl compounds themselves under our experimental
conditions. These reasons may be responsible for the observed negative
test of polymerization.

The change of the rate constants with
the change of both [H+] and [CS] can be expressed by the
following rate-law equation 12  where [Ox]T is the analytical total
concentration of the oxidant. Under pseudo first-order conditions
of [CS] ≫ [Ox], the rate constant is generally written as 13  

Comparing eqs 12 and 13 and rearrangement, one concludes that 14  where kobs corresponds
to kf. According to eq 14, at constant [H+], a plot of
1/kobs versus 1/[CS] should be linear
with a positive intercept on the 1/kobs axis as shown in the Michaelis–Menten plot (Figure 3). Again, as shown in Figure 6, plots of 1/kobs against 1/[H+] at constant [CS]
gave good straight lines with positive intercepts on 1/kobs axes from whose slopes and intercepts, the values
of the apparent rate constant ka′ (ka′ = kaK1) and elementary
rate constants ka″ (ka″ = ka) can be evaluated for autoacceleration. However, a similarity
between the values obtained from the intercepts of the two plots may
indicate the validity of the suggested mechanism; the evaluated values
of the formation constants K1 was found
to be difficult to be considered as the formation constants. Hence,
this mechanism may be excluded.

Figure 6 Plots [CS]/kobs vs [H+]
for the autoacceleration period in the oxidation of CS by [IrCl6]2–. [IrCl6]2– = 2 × 10–4, [CS] = 3 × 10–2, and I = 0.1 mol dm–3 at various
temperatures.

An alternative mechanism
may be suggested considering that the
CS substrate tends to protonate under our experimental conditions
forming the more reactive aloxnium species 15  followed by the attack of
the oxidant on the
center of that alxonium ion forming (C1) complex with release
of two protons as follows 16  

In a similar manner for derivation of the abovementioned rate-law
expression, one may conclude the following relationship 17   where [CS]T is the analytical
total concentration of the substrate. Rearrangement of eq 17 yields 18  

Assuming that the third term
(A = [Ox]/ka[CS]) of
the denominator of eq 18 is negligibly small, rearrangement
yields 19  

The evaluated values of the
protonation constant (K) in such plots were found
to be in good accord to those reported
for the protonation of the CS substrate7 or other polysaccharides8−14 in acidic solutions.8−14

Plots of [CS]/kobs against [H+] were found to be linear with positive intercepts on Y-axes as shown in Figure 6. The values of the apparent rate constants ka′ (where ka′ = kaKK2) and ka″ (where ka″ = kaK2) can be evaluated
from the slopes and intercepts of such plots, respectively. These
values were calculated by the method of least-squares and are summarized
in Table 2. The activation
parameters of ka′ and ka″ were calculated
from the Arrhenius and Eyring equation using the least-squares method
and are summarized along with the thermodynamic parameters of K in Table 3.

Moreover, the
observed inverse fractional order in [H+] for the rate
constant dependency in the induction period along
with formation of the 1:1 intermediate complexes in terms of the Michaelis–Menten
kinetic plots of 1/ks versus 1/[CS] means
that the formed radical (C.1) in the initial
stage also releases a protonium ion prior to its picking up of a further
oxidant molecule to form an intermediate complex C2• as follows 20   21  followed by electron transfer from the substrate
radical to the oxidant to give rise to the final oxidation product
as follows 22  

In a similar manner to the derivation of the
above rate-law expression
of (eq 12) in the former
mechanism, the change of the rate constant (ks) with changing both the concentration of the substrate radical
and [H+] (considering that [C2•] equals to the initial [CS]o and kobs′ equals ks) can be expressed by the following relationship 23  

Equation 23 on rearrangement
can be reformulated to eq 24 24  

Equation 24 requires
that plots of 1/kobs′ against either 1/[CS] or [H+] to be linear with positive intercepts on 1/kobs′ axes
as was experimentally observed in Figures 3 and 7, respectively.
The agreement between the values of the elementary rate constants
(kb) obtained from the intercepts of such
two plots may also confirm the validity of the suggested mechanism
for the induction period. The values of the apparent rate constants
(kb′ = kbK′K3) and the elementary rate constant kb can be evaluated from the slopes and intercepts
of 1/kobs – [H+] plots
at constant [CS]. These values were calculated by the least-squares
method and are summarized in Table 2. The activation parameters of these values were calculated
from Arrhenius and Eyring equations using the least-squares method
and are summarized in Table 3.

Figure 7 Plots 1/kobs′ vs [H+] for the induction
period in the oxidation of CS by [IrCl6]2–. [IrCl6]2– = 2 × 10–4, [CS] = 3 × 10–2, and I =
0.1 mol dm–3 at various temperatures.

The observed protonation values (K) for the CS
substrate were found to be in good agreement with that reported for
either other sulfated polysaccharides or the oxidation of the CS substrate
with other oxidants.7,8 Again the small values observed
for the activation energies (E≠) in the initial rapid step means that the energy of attraction forces
between the reactants is strong enough to overcome the energy barrier
needed for reaching the transition state or the formation of the intermediate,
that is, it does not need more energy for such purpose. This may be
explained by the formation of bridges between one chloride ligand
from [IrC6]2– anion and the CS substrate.
Thus, in turn, the formation of such bridges will facilitate the transfer
of electrons from the substrate and the oxidant. The negative and
neutral molecules as reactive species in the rate-determining step
may be confirmed by the negative slopes observed in the plots of ionic
strength dependency of the rate constant in terms of the Bronsted–Debye–Huckel
equation (Figure 5a,b).
The large negative values of entropies of activation (ΔS≠) indicate the compactness of the intermediates
formed, that is, the intermediates are more ordered than the reactants
which were stabilized by the solvation of the electron-transfer process.
Again, the positive values of ΔG≠ obtained may confirm the spontaneity of the complex formed prior
to the rate-determining step.

In view of the above interpretation
and the kinetic results, it
may suggest that the oxidation of CS by [IrCl6]2– proceeds by the one electron-transfer process of inner sphere nature,
which is supported by the observed large negative entropies of activation
(Table 3). Consequently,
a suitable reaction mechanism for oxidation of chondroitin-4-sulfate
by hexachloroiridate(IV) for both autoacceleration and induction periods
may be speculated in Schemes 1 and 2. It involves the attack of the
inert hexachloroiridate(IV) oxidant on the center of either the unprotonated
or protonated CS substrate forming the intermediate complexes (C1) with subtraction of one or two protons, respectively, by
water molecules prior to the rate-determining step to give free-radical
substrates (C1•) and the reduced form of the oxidant (Red) as initial oxidation
products in the fast first stage. The substrate radicals were also
picking up further oxidant molecules forming intermediate complexes
(C1•′), with releasing one proton prior to the rate-determining step of
the slow second stage, followed by transfer of electrons from the
intermediate radical substrates to the oxidant to give rise to the
final oxidation products.

5 Conclusions
The kinetics and mechanism of hexachloroiridate(IV) oxidation of
chondroitin-4-sulfate (CS) in aqueous acidic solutions at constant
ionic strength of 0.1 mol dm–3 has been investigated
spectrophotometrically. Pseudo first-order plots gave sigmoidal curves
of S-shape nature, indicating that the kinetics is of complexity nature.
Two distinct stages have been observed. The first stage was relatively
fast corresponding to the autoacceleration period, followed by a slow
stage. The influence of [H+] on the rate constants indicated
that the oxidation was of acid inhibition nature. The kinetic parameters
have been evaluated, and a suitable reaction mechanism is suggested
and discussed.
