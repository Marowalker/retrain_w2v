The enhancement mechanism
of piezoelectric properties by codoping
Mg + X (X = Nb, Ti, Zr, Hf) into aluminum nitride (AlN) was investigated
by first-principles calculations. Theoretically, the piezoelectric
constant (d33) can be increased when the
elastic constant (C33) is decreased and
the piezoelectric stress constant (e33) is increased. All components of e33, which consists of the clamped e33,
the Born effective charge (Z33), and the
strain sensitivity (du/dε) of the internal
parameter, were improved by the addition of Mg + X into AlN. The decrease
in C33 and the increase in du/dε that were observed in Mg + X-codoped AlN indicate the occurrence
of elastic softening which was considered to be influenced by changes
in the interatomic bond in the wurtzite structure. The bonding analysis
of metal–nitrogen (Me–N) pairs in the Mg + X-codoped
AlN system which was carried out by crystal orbital Hamilton populations
showed that the covalent bonding (Me–N) was weaker than in
pure AlN. Therefore, this weaker covalent bond is considered to be
one of the origins of the elastic softening. Similar phenomena were
also found for Sc-doped AlN which has higher piezoelectric response
than that of pure AlN.

1 Introduction
Aluminum nitride (AlN),
which has a wurtzite structure, exhibits
piezoelectricity which enables it to be used in thin film bulk acoustic
wave resonators for wireless telecommunication devices.1−3 Improvement in the piezoelectric properties of AlN is highly desired
for future evolution of communication systems. So far, the highest
piezoelectric response has been reported for Sc-doped AlN solid solutions.4,5 Piezoelectric response largely increases as the amount of Sc increases
which made it a promising material to be put into practical use as
a frequency filter for the fifth-generation mobile communication systems.
However, there is a problem in terms of cost since Sc is a relatively
expensive element for industrial manufacturing. Therefore, alternative
additional elements have been searched by experimental investigations
and theoretical calculations.6−9 Recently, it has been reported that piezoelectric
properties of AlN can be improved by adding multiple elements such
as Mg + X (X = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb) to AlN.10−16 Incorporating Mg + Nb into AlN, for example, resulted in comparable
piezoelectric response with Sc-doped AlN.

The piezoelectric
constant (d33) of
the wurtzite structure is estimated approximately as d33 = e33/C33. All components of e33,
which consists of the clamped e33, the
Born effective charge (Z33), and the strain
sensitivity (du/dε) of the internal parameter.
The origin of the dramatic improvement of the piezoelectric properties
for Sc-doped AlN has been investigated by theoretical calculations.17−20 Doping Sc into AlN causes an increase in Z33 and du/dε which leads to an increase
in e33. On the other hand, a lower elastic
constant C33 can also contribute in the
increasing d33. In fact, the calculated C33(17,19,20) is in good agreement with the experimental results qualitatively,
where the Young’s modulus value of Sc-doped AlN was found to
be lower than that of pure AlN.4 When 40
mol % of Sc is added into AlN, d33 increases
dramatically and the ratio of the lattice constant (c/a) decreases from ≈1.6 to ≈1.4.7 The similar structural change has been observed
in Ta- or Cr-doped AlN solid solutions where the enhancement of piezoelectric
response has been also obtained.7,9 Therefore, it has been
pointed out that there is the relationship between the decrease in
the c/a and the enhancement of piezoelectric
response.

Experiments and theoretical calculations have confirmed
that codoping
Mg + X (X = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb) into AlN which resulted in higher d33, also exhibited a decrease in the c/a as well as C33. However, the detailed mechanism of piezoelectric property enhancement,
particularly with regards to Z33 and du/dε, has not been investigated. Furthermore, the
elastic softening is also an important factor which is thought to
be involved in changing the interatomic bond but has never been discussed
in detail for Mg + X-codoped AlN. On the other hand, the crystal orbital
Hamilton population (COHP) analysis has been extensively used to evaluate
electron sharing in interatomic bonds.21,22 Therefore,
COHP analysis is considered to be a suitable method for the AlN-based
system which is constructed by covalent bonding. Given the importance
of this material, evaluating those factors for the case of Mg + X-codoped
AlN is expected to provide a meaningful insight for future materials
design.

In the present work, we evaluate the piezoelectric properties
of
the wurtzite structure in Mg + X-codoped AlN by first-principles calculations
and compare them with the case of Sc-doped AlN. In addition, the relationship
between elastic softening and interatomic bonds with the corresponding
piezoelectric response was investigated by COHP analysis.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Piezoelectric Properties
The calculated
and experimental results of lattice parameters are listed in Table 1. Figure 1 shows the supercell of Mg
+ X-codoped AlN (X = Nb, Ti, Zr, Hf) in these calculations. The orange,
green, blue, and gray spheres indicate Mg, X, Al, and N, respectively.
In the case of Sc-doped AlN, Mg and X sites were replaced by Sc. Although
it is known that the c/a of the
wurtzite structure is lowered by the additional elements into AlN
in the experimental results,10,11,15 Mg + X-codoped AlN also has the same tendency. Furthermore, our
calculated results are also consistent with the reported theoretical
calculation regarding such structural characteristics.15Figure 2 shows the calculated and experimental piezoelectric constants d33 as green and orange bars, respectively. The
reported piezoelectric constants are measured with different concentrations
in Mg + X-codoped AlN, ranging from a concentration as low as 5 mol
% to as high as 20%.10,11,15,16 Some of this requires a large sized supercell.
Because calculating a large supercell will raise the computational
cost, we decided to fix the concentration at 12.5 mol %. The maximum
difference between the concentration of dopants used in the calculation
and that observed in the experiments10,11,15,16 is 8%. The calculated d33 is in good agreement with the experimental
results.

Figure 3 shows the
piezoelectric stress constant (e33) and
elastic constant (C33) as red and blue
bars, respectively. In this work, the calculated piezoelectric stress
constant e33 of wurtzite AlN is 1.46 (C/m2). This value is relatively close with that reported by Dreyer
et al. (1.57).37 In addition, our calculated e33 and C33 of wurtzite
AlN are relatively consistent with the reported values where e33 and C33 have
been calculated as 1.29–1.80 (C/m2)37−41 and 354–387 (GPa).40,41 It is confirmed that
addition of either Sc or Mg + X into AlN results in lower C33 compared with pure AlN. On the other hand, e33 is increased by the addition of either Sc
or Mg + X. Therefore, the origin of improvement in the piezoelectric
properties of Mg + X-codoped AlN is understood to be similar to that
in the case of Sc-doped AlN, which is the decrease of C33 and the increase of e33.

Figure 3 The calculated piezoelectric stress constants (e33) and elastic constants (C33) of several AlN-based compounds are shown in red and blue bars,
respectively.

The piezoelectric stress constant e33 of the wurtzite structure is described as 1   2  in which e33clamped indicates
the electronic
response to strain and is evaluated by fixing the internal atomic
coordinates at their equilibrium positions. e33non-clamped indicates changes in the internal coordinates, where e is the (positive) electron charge, a is the equilibrium
lattice constant, Z33 is the Born effective
charge in units of e, and ε is the macroscopic
applied strain. The internal parameter u is the ratio
between the lattice constant c and the metal–nitrogen
distance along the c-axis in the wurtzite structure.
The calculated results of these terms are shown in Figure 4a–d. Figure 4e depicts the wurtzite structure
with the internal parameter u.

clamped e33, (b) the nonclamped e33, (c) the 33 components of the Born effective
charge Z33, and (d) the strain sensitivity
of the internal parameter du/dε for several
AlN-based compounds. (e) Wurtzite structure with the internal parameter u which indicates the ratio between the lattice constant c and the metal–nitrogen distance along the c-axis.

It is revealed that the e33clamped of Mg + X-codoped AlN
is higher than that of AlN which leads to greater e33. However, Sc-doped AlN does not have the same behavior
since the value of e33clamped is lower than that of AlN. Under
nonclamped conditions, Z33 and du/dε values of Sc-doped AlN and Mg + X-doped AlN were
larger than that of pure AlN. The increase in du/dε
is particularly large (>10%), which may greatly enhance e33non-clamped. It is considered that such behaviors were influenced by the elastic
softening metal–N bond since du/dε indicates
the change in the metal–N bond length on stress loading along
the c-axis direction. Therefore, elastic softening
is an important factor for the improvement of d33 not only in Sc-doped AlN but also in Mg + X-codoped AlN.

2.2 Bonding Analysis
Although AlN is
known to be a covalent compound, the change in the bonding characteristic
due to the substitution of Al with other elements is predicted to
affect the elastic softening of the wurtzite structure. Therefore,
the nature of covalent bonding in metal–N pairs is further
studied by COHP analysis.

Figure 5a–f show the calculated results of COHP for
each metal and nitrogen in AlN, Sc-doped AlN and Mg + X-codoped AlN.
In these figures, the horizontal axis is energy based on the Fermi
energy EF and the vertical axis is COHP.
For COHP, the negative region represents the bonding orbits and the
positive region indicates the contribution from the antibonding orbits.
Regarding Al–N and Mg–N pairs from Figure 5a–f, bonding orbitals
are observed to be filled below EF. The
metal–N bond strength is evaluated by the integrated COHP (ICOHP)
and those values are listed in Table 2. A lower the ICOHP value corresponds with the stronger
covalent bond. The similar ICOHP values of Al–N in AlN, Sc-doped
AlN and Mg + X-codoped AlN suggest similar bond strength of Al–N
in all the calculated compound systems. However, ICOHP values of Mg–N
were found to be higher than Al–N in Mg + X-codoped AlN which
indicate that the bond strength of Mg–N is weaker than that
of Al–N. This may be due to the fact that the amount of valence
electrons in Mg is smaller than that in Al, hence fewer number of
electrons are involved in forming the covalent bond of Mg–N
compared with Al–N. For Sc-doped AlN, Sc–N has the positive
COHP value which indicates the antibonding behavior (Figure 5b). In addition, since Ti has
only one atomic number difference with Sc, the shape of the COHP curve
of Ti–N in Mg + Ti-codoped AlN is found to be similar to that
of Sc–N in Sc-doped AlN. The ICOHPs of Ti–N and Sc–N
are higher than that of Al–N, hence the strength of the covalent
bond of Ti–N and Sc–N is considered to be weaker than
that of Al–N. For Mg + Nb-codoped AlN, the COHP curve of Nb–N
also has positive values and the value of ICOHP indicates weaker covalent
bonding. Such pronounced weakening in the interatomic bond could affect
the mechanical properties of the material. From these results, it
is considered that the weaker covalent Mg–N, Nb–N, Sc–N,
and Ti–N bonds may contribute in promoting the elastic softening
of the Mg + Ti-codoped AlN, Mg + Nb-codoped AlN, and Sc-doped AlN
wurtzite structure.

For Mg + Zr-codoped AlN and Mg +
Hf-codoped AlN, the COHP curves
for Zr–N and Hf–N are in the negative region (Figure 5e,f). The bond strengths
of Zr–N and Hf–N estimated by ICOHP are found to be
similar with that of Al–N in pure AlN. In these compounds,
only the ICOHPs of Mg–N are higher than that of Al–N.
Therefore, the elastic softening of Mg + Zr-codoped AlN and Mg + Hf-codoped
AlN is thought to be mainly influenced by a weaker bond of Mg–N.
However, in order to completely understand the origin of elastic softening
of a system, other factors such as Coulomb interactions, correlation
interactions, and exchange interactions etc. should also be taken
into consideration. Therefore, those factors will be further evaluated
in the future.

Our calculated results of piezoelectric properties
and the results
of COHP analysis support the suggestion of Talley et al. which explain
that the lattice frustration from the covalent wurtzite to ionic hexagonal
BN structure,20 is an important characteristic
to obtain high piezoelectricity. A weaker covalent bond and an increase
in Z33 which is the calculated valence
during the piezoelectric phenomenon may promote lattice transition
in Sc-doped AlN and Mg + X-codoped AlN. To fully transform into the
hexagonal BN structure, tetracoordinate wurtzite contracts in the c-axis direction and the metal atom takes five coordination
with nitrogen. From theoretical calculation, the c/a ratio of the hexagonal BN structure has been
estimated to be approximately 1.2–1.317,20 which is lower than that of the wurtzite structure (≈1.6).
Therefore, the decrease in the c/a that was observed in the Sc-doped AlN and Mg + X-codoped AlN system
is considered to be because of the weaker covalent bonding which leads
lattice frustration from the covalent wurtzite to the ionic hexagonal
BN structure.

3 Conclusions
The
piezoelectric properties of Mg + X-codoped AlN (X = Nb, Ti,
Zr, Hf) were evaluated by first-principles calculations. The piezoelectric
constant (d33) increases due to the decrease
of the elastic constant C33 and the increase
of the piezoelectric stress constant e33. All components of e33, which are the
clamped e33, the Born effective charge Z33, and the strain sensitivity du/dε of the internal parameter, were improved by substituting
Al with Mg + X. The decrease in C33 and
the improvement in du/dε indicate an occurrence
of elastic softening in Mg + X-codoped AlN. A weaker covalent bonding
between Mg–N and X–N was found by COHP analyses and
it is considered to take an important role in promoting the elastic
softening for Mg + X-codoped AlN. Moreover, the origin of decrease
in the c/a regarding Sc-doped AlN
and Mg + X-codoped AlN is thought to be because of the weaker covalent
bonding.

4 Computational Details
The structure
models of AlN solid solution were constructed by
the special quasirandom structures method which is performed by the
alloy theoretic automated toolkit based on a Monte Carlo simulated
annealing method.23 The size of the supercell
was 2 × 2 × 2 (32 atoms) of the wurtzite structure, in which
Mg and X (X = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb) substitute for Al sites. Figure 1 shows the supercell of Mg
+ X-codoped AlN in the present work. The orange, green, blue, and
gray spheres indicate Mg, X, Al, and N, respectively. In the case
of Sc-doped AlN, Mg and X sites were replaced by Sc. The chemical
composition of the supercell was fixed as MgXAl14N16 and Sc2Al14N16 since the
enhanced piezoelectric response was confirmed to be found around this
composition.

The lattice relaxation was performed with the Vienna
Ab initio
Simulation Package code24,25 which is based on density
functional theory. The exchange and correlation functions were given
by the generalized gradient approximation, as proposed by Perdew et
al.26 We employed Blochl’s projector-augmented
wave method as implemented by Kresse and Joubert.27,28 The Monkhorst–Pack method29 is
used to set the k-point mesh. The structure optimizations
were performed with a 5 × 5 × 3 mesh for k-point sampling with a cutoff energy of 500 eV. The elastic coefficient
and piezoelectric stress tensors were evaluated from phonon and dielectric
response calculations performed from finite differences and density
functional perturbation theory,30−32 respectively. The convergence
criterion for the electric self-consistency loop was 10–6 eV in all calculations. Chemical bonding analyses were performed
by the COHP method which is implemented in the LOBSTER code.33−36
