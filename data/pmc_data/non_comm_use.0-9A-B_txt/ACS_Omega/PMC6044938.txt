The
electrophilic natural product parthenolide has generated significant
interest as a model for potential chemotherapeutics. Similar to other
α,β-unsaturated carbonyl electrophiles, parthenolide induces
the heat shock response in leukemia cells, potentially through covalent
adduction of heat shock proteins. Other thiol-reactive electrophiles
have also been shown to induce the heat shock response as well as
to covalently adduct members of the heat shock protein family, such
as heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72). To identify sites of modification
of Hsp72 by parthenolide, we used high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry
to detect 10 lysine, histidine, and cysteine residues of recombinant
Hsp72 as modified in vitro by 10 and 100 μM parthenolide. To
further ascertain that modification of Hsp72 by parthenolide occurs
inside cells and not simply as an in vitro artifact, an alkyne-labeled
derivative of parthenolide was synthesized to enable enrichment and
detection of protein targets of parthenolide using copper-catalyzed
[3 + 2] azide–alkyne cycloaddition. The alkyne-labeled parthenolide
derivative displays an half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in undifferentiated acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1)
of 13.1 ± 1.1 μM, whereas parthenolide has an IC50 of 4.7 ± 1.1 μM. Concentration dependence of protein
modification by the alkyne–parthenolide derivative was demonstrated,
as well as in vitro adduction of Hsp72. Following treatment of THP-1
cells in culture by the alkyne–parthenolide, adducted proteins
were isolated with neutravidin resin and detected by immunoblotting
in the enriched protein fraction. Hsp70 proteins were detected in
the enriched proteins, indicating that Hsp70 proteins were adducted
intracellularly by the alkyne–parthenolide derivative.

==== Body
Introduction
Recent studies have
identified parthenolide (1, Figure 1), a sesquiterpene
lactone known as the active ingredient in feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), as a potential model compound
for new ways to treat leukemia and other cancers.1,2 Parthenolide
contains an electrophilic α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group,
and its mechanism of action is attributed to its ability to undergo
Michael addition with biological nucleophiles, resulting in covalent
modification of proteins and peptides.3 Thiol-reactive electrophiles, such as parthenolide, are known to
affect multiple cellular pathways, many of which are implicated in
cancer and degenerative diseases.4 Recent
clinical interest in parthenolide and other sesquiterpene lactones
arose due to evidence for its selective eradication of leukemic stem
cells after treatment, which can potentially reduce the risk of recurrence
in treated patients.1,5 Leukemic stem cells, in particular
primitive (CD34+) cells, are susceptible to parthenolide
largely due to their low intracellular concentrations of glutathione
and upregulation of their glutathione metabolic pathway.6 Although the glutathione pathway has proven to
be important for understanding the leukemic stem cells’ susceptibility
to parthenolide, there are many other cellular pathways affected by
parthenolide, which should be considered in the evaluation of parthenolide
and its derivatives as clinical treatments.

Figure 1 (A) Chemical structures
of parthenolide (1) and alkyne–parthenolide
(2). (B) Alkyne–parthenolide 2 has
an half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 13.1
μM comparable to that of 1 at 4.7 μM in cultured
and undifferentiated THP-1 cells. Viability of cells treated with 1 is denoted by triangle markers (▲) with the nonlinear
fit given as a solid line, whereas the viability of THP-1 cells treated
with 2 is represented with circles (●) and the
nonlinear fit is a dashed line. For this assay, THP-1 cells were plated
at 30 000 cells per well prior to treatment and, after addition
of the drug, were then incubated for 24 h. Water-soluble tetrazolium
salt 1 (WST-1) was then added, and the absorbance reads at 440 nm
with 600 nm as a reference wavelength. Error bars represent the standard
deviation of eight replicates.

Cellular targets of parthenolide include many common targets
of
thiol-reactive electrophiles, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB)
and thioredoxin.7−11 Inhibitor of kappa B kinase was the first directly confirmed target
and represents part of the inhibition mechanism of nuclear factor
kappa B (NFκB) by parthenolide. Direct inhibition of NFκB
by parthenolide is due to the covalent adduction of cysteine 38 in
the p65 subunit,8 whereas adduction of
caspase 1 by parthenolide results in loss of protease activity and
inhibition of pyroptotic cell death.10 Analysis
by Pei et al. using a biotinylated parthenolide derivative identified
key components of the glutathione and oxidative stress pathways as
targets of parthenolide in CD34+ primary leukemia cells,
including glutamate–cysteine ligase, glutathione peroxidase,
and thioredoxin.6

Induction of the
heat shock response (HSR) by thiol-reactive electrophiles,
such as parthenolide, in cultured cells and animal models is well
documented.12−21 Treatment of colorectal cancer cells with the endogenous lipid electrophile
4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) induces translocation of heat shock factor
1 (Hsf1) into the nucleus and expression of heat shock protein 72
(Hsp72).17 An in silico comparison of the
genetic profile of parthenolide with the Gene Expression Omnibus database
identified both 4-HNE and celastrol as potential therapeutics with
expression patterns similar to parthenolide.18 4-HNE covalently adducts both Hsp72 and Hsp90 in vitro and in animal
models.14,19,20

In human
cells, the heat shock response can be induced through
the dissociation of a protein complex largely composed of heat shock
protein 70 (constitutive, Hsc70 or inducible, Hsp72), Hsp90, Hsp40,
and Hsf1.22 Other co-chaperones, such as
the BAG family of nucleotide exchange factors, also interact with
the core complex to control and facilitate a variety of cellular pathways.23 Through this complex, Hsp72 sits squarely at
the nexus of both protein homeostasis and signal transduction with
its co-chaperone Hsp90 and affects a wide array of client proteins.24 Hsp72 is an adenosine 5′-triphosphate-dependent
chaperone consisting of an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain and
also a C-terminal substrate-binding region.25

The similarities in chemistry and genetic response between
4-HNE
and parthenolide are substantial and suggest that parthenolide may
interact with the heat shock response system in a similar manner to
4-HNE. It was our hypothesis that parthenolide can adduct Hsp72, and
to identify such covalent modification sites, we used high-resolution
liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)
to detect modification of recombinant Hsp72 in vitro at increasing
concentrations of parthenolide. Adduction of the protein with parthenolide
was detected at lysine, histidine, and cysteine residues, representing
the first identifications of noncysteine adducts of parthenolide.
We have also synthesized a versatile bio-orthogonal derivative of
parthenolide (2), which contains an alkyne moiety enabling
affinity capture and labeling within a biological context, to evaluate
its covalent modification of Hsp72 both in vitro and in treated cells.
The toxicity of the derivative to undifferentiated human acute monocytic
leukemia cells (THP-1) was compared to parthenolide using a water-soluble
cellular proliferation reagent to ascertain that our modification
did not affect parthenolide’s cellular effects. Hsp72 was identified
as a protein target of parthenolide both in vitro and in treatment
of cultured THP-1 cells using derivative 2. Parthenolide
derivative 2 was tested for modification of purified
proteins in cell lysates and was used to isolate modified proteins
in cultured and undifferentiated THP-1 cells.

The involvement
of parthenolide with the heat shock response system
has implications for the effect of similar or derivative therapeutic
molecules on cellular responses to therapy. The heat shock system
is a cytoprotective mechanism, the inducement of which can be counterproductive
in chemotherapeutic regimens. Conversely, some cancers depend largely
on an upregulated heat shock system for increased cell growth and
stamina, and dysregulation of that function can lead to increased
apoptotic events.26 Naturally occurring
sesquiterpene lactones, such as parthenolide, and similarly reactive
synthetic molecules are currently under evaluation for their effects.27−29 As more potential therapeutics are developed that contain the α,β-unsaturated
lactone functionality, its reactivity must be comprehensively characterized.

Results
and Discussion
Hsp72 Is Modified in Vitro by Parthenolide
at Cysteine, Histidine,
and Lysine Residues
To identify potential sites of modification,
recombinant purified Hsp72 was incubated with 10 and 100 μM
parthenolide overnight at 37 °C, followed by proteolytic in-gel
digestion and analysis by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC–MS). The raw data were searched with a Mascot database
and then parsed and filtered using Scaffold. Each reported modification
was within 5 ppm error of its predicted precursor mass-to-charge ratio,
and the respective MS2 spectrum included coverage of b
or y ions across the modified amino acid. The total sequence coverage
of Hsp72 peptides in our experiment ranged from 83 to 91% for each
set of experimental samples (Figure S1, Supporting Information). For recombinant human Hsp72, 10 modifications
were validated (representative MS2 spectra are found in Figures S2–S12, Supporting Information). Parthenolide’s reactive moiety is the α,β-unsaturated
lactone, not the epoxide. A reduced compound retaining the epoxide
was not found to be reactive with human serum albumin, whereas parthenolide
did react with a cysteine available on the protein.11

In this work, two cysteine residues were found to
be modified by parthenolide at a concentration of 100 μM, and
several lysine and histidine residues also exhibited modification
(Table 1). Both cysteines
identified as targets of parthenolide are known targets of other thiol-reactive
compounds. Previously, 4-HNE was found to modify C267 of human Hsp72
in vitro at concentrations of 10 and 100 μM after incubation
overnight at 37 °C and that 4-HNE treatment reduced Hsp72 chaperone
refolding activity. Given the extent of inhibition of chaperone refolding
resulting from 4-HNE treatment (up to 75%), modification of C267 is
very likely the site of the causal adduction.14 Oxidation of C306 in human Hsp72 by methylene blue has been reported,
and oxidation of C267 is suspected. Mutation of both C306 and C267
to serine renders Hsp72 insensitive to methylene blue oxidation and
reduction in adenosinetriphosphatase activity, suggesting that these
residues are targets for other cysteine-reactive compounds, such as
4-HNE and parthenolide.30 Similarly, the
yeast Hsp72 homolog, Ssa1, requires C267 and C306 for electrophilic
activation of the heat shock response through covalent modification.13 From these previous results, we expected to
observe at least modification at C267 and C306, both of which were
detected after treatment with 100 μM parthenolide (Table 1), but neither with
the 10 μM treatment.

We also report here eight
previously unidentified modifications
of Hsp72 at one histidine and seven lysines at both 10 and 100 μM
treatments (Table 1). These modifications were verified as described above. Modification
of lysine and histidine residues by electrophilic compounds containing
α,β-unsaturated carbonyls have been reported in the literature.4,31,32 Although parthenolide modification
of such residues on proteins under aqueous conditions has not been
reported previously, the reaction of primary and secondary amines
with parthenolide in methanol is a synthetic route for the development
of new chemotherapeutic drugs.2,33 Furthermore, electrophilic
modification of histidine by electrophiles 4-HNE and biliatresone
(an α,β-unsaturated ketone) suggests that modification
is possible with a secondary amine as nucleophile, such as an imidazole
group.32,34,35 Hsp72 has
50 lysine residues, 7 of which we found to be modified. To try to
understand why those seven were targeted as well as the other cysteines
and histidine, we used the PDB2PQR server to run a PROPKA3 calculation to
find pKa and surface exposure for all
of the ionizable amino acids in Hsp72.36,37 We used two
PDB files to calculate the pKa’s
for Hsp72 because a single crystal structure was not available: 2e88
for the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain and 4po2 for the C-terminal
substrate-binding domain. The calculated pKa’s of the adducted lysines (Table 1, Supporting Information) range from 10.27 to 11.41, and surface exposure
ranges from 0 to 25% buried. We expected to find that the adducted
lysines had both lower pKa values and
more surface exposure than the unadducted lysines; however, there
was no consistent consensus for pKa value.
Most of the lysines in Hsp72 were, as expected, close to the surface.
For the five cysteines in Hsp72, two were involved in a disulfide
bond (C574 and C603) and C17 was very deeply buried within the protein.
The two adducted cysteines were calculated to be deeply buried at
85 and 79% for C267 and C306, respectively; however, their calculated
pKa values were lower than those of the
other three cysteine residues. Previous results from Szapacs et al.
have shown that lower pKa can correlate
with faster kinetic reaction of histidine with 4-HNE.31

Alkyne-Labeled Parthenolide Derivative 2 Retains
Toxicity against THP-1 Cells
Alkyne-modified parthenolide
derivative 2 was synthesized from (+)-parthenolide in
a two-step process (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Parthenolide was first oxidized to melampomagnolide B with selenium
dioxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide, as previously
reported.7,38 Esterification of melampomagnolide B with
hexynoic acid using Mitsunobu coupling was unsuccessful; however,
the Steglich esterification using dimethylaminopyridine and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
was successful, with an overall yield of 63%. The resulting compound
was verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy and liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry.

To ascertain that the parthenolide derivative
retained the cellular effects of the parent molecule, the toxicities
of parthenolide and alkyne–parthenolide were determined in
undifferentiated THP-1 cells. In this experiment, THP-1 monocytic
cells were treated in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) for 48 h prior to analysis using WST-1 to determine cell
viability. The IC50 of 2 was calculated to
be 13.1 ± 1.1 μM in comparison to parthenolide’s
IC50 of 4.7 ± 1.1 μM (Figure 1). The IC50 of the derivative
increased less than 3-fold, and the 95% confidence interval between
the two means ranges from 5.06 to 11.74 μM, which suggest that
the addition of alkyne did not practically affect the potency of the
parthenolide derivative. The small statistically significant change
in toxicity may be due to lower membrane permeability of the alkyne–parthenolide
with the addition of hexynoic acid to the molecule; however, the derivative
retains the low micromolar toxicity of parthenolide.

Alkyne-Labeled
Parthenolide Derivative 2 Adducts
Multiple Proteins after Incubation with Both Cell Lysates and Cultured
THP-1 Cells
To test the capacity of 2 not only
to adduct proteins but also to allow specific detection through bio-orthogonal
chemistry, cell lysates were treated in vitro and then subjected to
copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with an
azide–biotin tag.39,40 The appearance of multiple
streptavidin-reactive bands on an immunoblot of treated and “clicked”
samples indicates that a range of proteins within the cell lysates
was modified with biotin when the full CuAAC reaction was performed
(Figure 2A). With omission
of the azide–biotin (Figure 2A, lane 2) or when the lysates were treated with the
vehicle control dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Figure 2A, lane 3), no signal was observed, indicating
the signal was specific to the complete reaction and the treatment
with 2. The multiple protein bands apparent in Figure 2A verify that 2 adducts many cytoplasmic proteins, potentially representing
previously identified protein targets of parthenolide adduction as
well as potential new targets.6,7,10,41 Adducted and biotinylated proteins
from treated cell lysates were isolated using neutravidin affinity
purification at various treatment concentrations (Figure 2B). The efficacy of this method
at isolating different amounts of modified proteins is shown in Figure 2B, with a concentration-dependent
increase in the quantity of biotinylated proteins from cells treated
with 50, 100, and 200 μM alkyne–parthenolide. Proteins
within THP-1 cells were adducted by 2 despite the presence
of 1.0 mM reduced glutathione in the RPMI medium.

Figure 2 Proteins in both cell
lysates (A) and cultured cells (B) are modified
by parthenolide derivative 2. (A) Modification of proteins
in whole cell lysates from THP-1 cells. Each lane contains 15 μg
of protein as follows: (1) THP-1 cell lysate treated with 2 and labeled with CuAAC. (2) THP-1 cell lysate treated with 2, but lacking the azide–biotin in the CuAAC reaction.
(3) THP-1 lysate treated with DMSO and labeled with CuAAC. (4) Biotinylated
superoxide dismutase as positive control. (B) Recovery of modified
proteins from cells treated with increasing concentrations of 2. THP-1 cells were treated at confluence in RPMI medium with
parthenolide derivative 2 for 1 h, lysed, protein concentration
normalized to 3 mg/mL, and subjected to CuAAC. After the CuAAC treatment,
modified proteins were isolated with neutravidin resin.

Recombinant Hsp72 Is Adducted in Vitro by 2
To test that our derivative 2 would
covalently modify
Hsp72 in a similar manner to parthenolide, purified recombinant protein
was treated in vitro with 100 μM 2 for 1 h and
subjected to CuAAC with an azide tag to biotinylate the modification
sites. Modification and biotinylation of Hsp72 are observed in Figure 3A through recognition
of the biotinylation with an antibiotin–horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) antibody, whereas lanes containing incomplete CuAAC reactions
or treatment with unmodified parthenolide present no signal. The presence
of Hsp72 protein in each lane is represented by the anti-His6 lower blot, with signal shown in each lane. The upper band (>70
kDa) observed in the full reaction lane is likely due to the dimerization
of modified Hsp72. This upper band suggested that parthenolide may
cross-link two Hsp72 monomers together; however, we saw no evidence
of cross-linking by parthenolide in model thiol reactions with 3-nitrobenzyl
mercaptan detected with LC–MS (R. Connor, unpublished observations).42

Figure 3 Hsp72 is modified by parthenolide and related electrophiles
both
in vitro and in THP-1 cells. (A) Recombinant Hsp72 is modified in
vitro after treatment with 100 μM 2, as shown by
its biotinylation signal in lane 1. All lanes contain 7.5 μg
of protein. Lanes 2 and 3 are Hsp72 protein incubated with 2, but (2) without the azide tag in the labeling reaction and (3)
without the ligand and catalyst. Lane 4 is the full CuAAC reaction
with parthenolide. Each of the four lanes contains His-tagged Hsp72
protein, as shown with anti-His-tag antibody detection. (B) Modification
of Hsp70 proteins in THP-1 cells is exhibited by neutravidin capture
from cells treated with 100 μM 1, 2, and DMSO for 1 h. Each cell lysate was normalized to 4 mg/mL total
protein prior to CuAAC. Lanes 1 and 4 show elution from the neutravidin
beads with 3 mM d-biotin; thus, lane 4 contains Hsp70 proteins
from adduction by 2. Lanes 2, 5, and 6 were eluted by
boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and only lane 5 contains Hsp70 proteins
from adduction by 2. Lane 3 contains 15 μg of protein
from whole cell lysate from treated THP-1 cells as positive control
for detection of Hsp72.

Adducted Hsp70 Proteins Are Isolated from Cells Treated with 2
Given that 2 modifies Hsp72 in vitro,
we expected to find Hsp72 isolated from 2-treated cells.
As shown in Figure 3B, Hsp70 proteins are present in the enriched fraction of adducted
proteins from THP-1 cells treated with 100 μM 2 for 1 h. Enriched proteins from cells treated with parthenolide
or DMSO (Figure 3B,
lanes 1, 2, and 6) do not contain Hsp72 as indicated by detection
with an Hsp70 antibody. Conversely, the positive control (Figure 3B, lane 3) and the
two enriched samples from 2-treated cells do display
Hsp70 signals. The enriched proteins were first eluted from the resin
competitively with 3 mM d-biotin and then finally by heating
the resin in loading buffer. Both methods show enrichment of Hsp70
proteins in the eluted samples, indicating that adduction occurs intracellularly
by α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, such as parthenolide
and 2.

Biotinylated parthenolide derivatives have
previously been used to identify protein targets; however, the addition
of a biotin moiety is a substantial modification to the molecule.
Since the first report on parthenolide–biotin in 2001, the
CuAAC reaction has emerged as a very facile and efficient reaction
for bio-orthogonal chemistry under aqueous conditions.39,40 The relatively small addition of functional groups, such as an alkyne
or azide, to a target molecule represents a smaller change to a molecule
versus the larger biotin heterocycle and polyethylene glycol linker.
Addition of a functional group, such as an alkyne, also enables the
versatile attachment of various types of labels, such as affinity
tags, fluorophores, or radioisotopes, via its bio-orthogonal partner
functionality.

Conclusions
Using high-resolution
mass spectrometry and bio-orthogonal chemistry,
we have shown that Hsp72 is modified both in vitro and in cultured
cells by parthenolide and derivative 2. We identified
10 sites of in vitro modification of Hsp72 by parthenolide: 2 previously
reported targets (C267 and C306) and 8 new adduction sites on lysine
and histidine residues. For verification of modification of Hsp72
in cells, we synthesized a versatile alkyne-bearing derivative of
parthenolide that exhibits similar effects on THP-1 leukemia cells
as parthenolide. Derivative 2 modifies Hsp72, both in
vitro and in cell culture, as shown using CuAAC addition of a biotin
affinity label and affinity purification of modified cellular proteins.
The broad distribution of adduction sites across the Hsp72 protein
illustrates the reactivity of parthenolide, an electrophilic natural
product and a potential chemotherapeutic compound.

Methods
Reagents
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used as received, unless otherwise stated. (+)-Parthenolide was
purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX). Mouse antibiotin–HRP
antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (La Jolla, CA) and antirabbit
secondary antibody was purchased from Rockland Immunochemicals (Limerick,
PA). Both the Hsp70 (H-300) primary antibody and His-probe (H-3) HRP
conjugate were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA). Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was
purchased from Gold Biotechnology (St. Louis, MO). Tris-benzyltriazolylamine
(TBTA)43 and azide–biotin44 were synthesized as described previously.

Production of Recombinant Human Hsp72
Human gene Hsp70A1A
was obtained from Dr. Richard Morimoto within plasmid pET-wt-Hsp70.45 This gene was amplified using the following
DNA primers: pQe80Hsp70F, TACTCTACGCATGCATGGCCAAAGCCGCG and pQeHsp70R,
GGTTCCGCAAGCTTCTAATCTACCTC. After amplification, the Hsp70 gene was
ligated into the vector pQe80 to add a C-terminal, six-histidine-tag
at the BamHI/HindIII sites to create
pQEHsp70-His6. pQEHsp70-His6 was transformed
into BL21 cells for expression in lysogeny broth medium. After expression following IPTG induction for 4 h at 37 °C,
the Hsp72 protein was purified by native nickel affinity chromatography
(His-Pur Ni-NTA resin; Thermo Fisher) in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl at
pH 7.5. Excess imidazole following the native purification was removed
through the use of Ultracel YM-30 filters (MilliporeSigma, Darmstadt,
Germany).

Identification of Hsp72 Modification Sites by Parthenolide
Purified recombinant Hsp72 produced and purified as described previously
was treated with DMSO (vehicle control), 10 and 100 μM parthenolide
individually in 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 overnight at 37 °C.
This treatment was repeated twice so that each condition was analyzed
in triplicate. After the overnight incubation, 6× sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) loading buffer
containing 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to the samples prior
to heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The adducted proteins were separated
on a 10% Tris–glycine polyacrylamide gel, and the resulting
bands were excised for analysis. The gel slices were sent to MS Bioworks
for digestion and analysis using the following methods: The in-gel
digestion was performed by a ProGest robot (Digilab) and consisted
of an initial wash with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate followed by an
acetonitrile wash. Subsequently, the proteins were reduced with 10
mM DTT at 60 °C and then alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide at
room temperature. Trypsin digestion was performed for 4 h at 37 °C
and then quenched with formic acid for direct analysis by high-resolution
LC–MS/MS on either a Fusion Lumos or a Q Exactive HF spectrometer
equipped with a Waters nanoACQUITY high-performance liquid chromatography
system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). One set of three
samples was analyzed with a Fusion Lumos, and the two other sets were
analyzed with a Q Exactive for a total of nine samples. The peptides
were identified using the MASCOT database, and parthenolide modifications
were found by searching for dynamic modification with parthenolide
(full adduct: +248.14 Da or adduct with loss of hydroxyl: +231.137
Da) at cysteine, lysine, and histidine residues. Other dynamic modifications
in the search were methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation, deamidation,
Pyro-Glu, and cysteine alkylation. The peptide mass tolerance was
set at 10 ppm with a fragment tolerance of 0.01 Da. The resulting
DAT files were parsed and filtered with the Scaffold software with
1% protein and peptide false discovery rate such that redundant proteins
were removed. Scaffold PTM was used to assign site localization probabilities
and generate an A-score for identified modifications. Parthenolide
modifications were not detected in any of the three DMSO-treated control
samples.

Synthesis of Parthenolide Derivative 2
(+)-Parthenolide was oxidized according to the previously reported
methods to obtain melampomagnolide B.7,38 Melampomagnolide
B was esterified by the Steglich esterification with slight modification.46 Specifically, melampomagnolide B (43.9 mg, 0.171
mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of dehydrated CH2Cl2. To this solution, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (34.82 mg, 0.285 mmol)
and 5-hexynoic acid (31.4 μL, 0.285 mmol) were added. After
the addition, the reaction was cooled in an ice bath and stirred for
5 min. N,N′-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(64.37 mg, 0.312 mmol) was added and stirred for 10 min, after which
the reaction vessel was purged with nitrogen. The reaction was removed
from the ice bath and allowed to slowly warm to room temperature with
stirring for at least 3 h and up to 24 h until the reaction was judged
complete by thin-layer chromatography. Upon completion, the reaction
was filtered to remove insoluble material, and the filtrate was washed
with saturated sodium bicarbonate to remove excess hexynoic acid.
The organic layer was washed twice with deionized water and purified
using flash chromatography (50% ethyl acetate/hexane) and isolated
as a white solid in 63% yield: 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 6.3 (d, H-13α), 5.72 (t, H-1), 5.6 (d, H-13β),
4.6 (q, H-14), 3.9 (t, H-6), 2.9 (d, H-5), 2.85–2.99 (m, H-7),
2.5 (t, H-17), 2.37–2.56 (H-9β, H-2β), 2.3 (td,
H-18), 2.14–2.28 (H-2α, H-3β, H-8α, H-9α),
2.03 (t, H-21), 1.89 (p, H-19), 1.65–1.74 (m, H-8β),
1.58 (s, H-15), 1.13 (t, H-3α).

Cell Culture
THP-1,
human monocytic leukemia cells,
were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Consortium and cultured
in RPMI medium buffered with 10 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (pH 7.4), containing minimum
essential medium vitamins and 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals,
Flowery Branch, GA) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Treatment of THP-1 cells was performed at confluency (1 × 106 cells/mL) in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, as
noted for each experiment.

Viability Assays
Water-soluble tetrazolium
salt 1 (WST-1)
was obtained from Roche and used as received. THP-1 cells were plated
as monocytes at a density of 30 000 cells per well.47 Drug treatments were applied as 1000× dilutions
in RPMI medium, resulting in a total DMSO content of 0.1% for each
well. The treated cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C under
5% CO2 atmosphere. To each well, 10 μL of WST-1 reagent
was added, and after incubation for approximately 45 min, absorbance
at 440 nm with a reference wavelength of 600 nm was measured using
a SpectraMax M3 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The
percent viability for each drug concentration was calculated as the
treated WST response per DMSO vehicle control response. The IC50 was then determined by fitting percent viability with a
nonlinear regression for a normalized response using GraphPad Prism
(La Jolla, CA).

Immunoblotting
All gels were run
using the Bio-Rad
MINI-Protean system with Tris–glycine buffer. Proteins were
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Trans-Blot Turbo
(Bio-Rad) semidry system. Membranes were blocked with 3% milk in 1×
Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4), with 0.1% Tween-20 prior to incubation
with antibodies. All antibodies, including secondary antibodies, were
used at dilutions of 1:1000 in 3% milk in TBS-T. The SuperSignal West
Pico luminescence reagent from Thermo Pierce (Waltham, MA) was used
for detection of horseradish peroxidase signal on the membranes. Blots
were imaged using a ProteinSimple FluorChem digital imager (San Jose,
CA).

In Vitro Modification and CuAAC Biotinylation of Recombinant
Hsp72 with 2
Recombinant Hsp72 protein was incubated
in 50 mM phosphate buffer (50 μL) in the presence of compound 2 (see Results and Discussion for concentrations
of 2 used). After incubation for 1 h, the reagents for
CuAAC were added to final concentrations of 10 mM CuSO4, 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and 1 mM TBTA. The volume
of the reaction was increased to 100 μL with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and allowed to react overnight at 4 °C prior
to separation and analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.

Treatment
of Cell Lysates with Alkyne–Parthenolide
Confluent
THP-1 cells were washed twice with 1× PBS (pH 7.4)
and then lysed in 1× PBS (pH 7.4) with 0.1% NP-40 and mammalian
protease inhibitors (MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO), using a sonicator
set to 30% amplitude with six 10 s pulses. After sonication, the lysates
were clarified by centrifugation at 10 000g for 15 min. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad
Protein Assay. The cell lysates were diluted to 2 mg/mL, and 1, 2, or DMSO was added to a concentration of
100 μM or 0.1% (DMSO). After incubation for 1 h, the reagents
for CuAAC were added to final concentrations of 10 mM CuSO4, 1 mM TCEP, and 1 mM TBTA. The reaction was incubated at 4 °C
for at least 1 h. Following incubation, the proteins were precipitated
with 4 volumes of methanol and 1 volume of chloroform. This precipitate
was pelleted by centrifugation at 4000g for 15 min.
The pellet was resuspended in 2× Laemmli loading buffer (Bio-Rad)
and loaded directly into a Tris–glycine 10% polyacylamide SDS-PAGE
gel without heating or reducing agent. Immunoblotting proceeded as
described above.

Isolation of Modified Proteins from Treated
Cells
THP-1
cells were grown to confluence (1 × 106 cells/mL)
and then treated with DMSO and 50, 100, and 200 μM 2 for 1 h in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 1000g and washed once
with ice-cold 1× PBS (pH 7.4). The cells were lysed in 1×
PBS (pH 7.4) with 0.5% NP-40 with protease inhibitors using sonication
as described above. Following sonication, the samples were centrifuged
at 16 000g for 10 min at 4 °C to clarify
the lysate. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein
assay. Cell lysates were diluted to 3 or 4 mg/mL for CuAAC reactions
performed in 1.0 mL volume under conditions as stated above. Following
overnight incubation at 4 °C, SDS was added as a 10% (w/v) solution
to each sample to a final concentration of 0.91% SDS to solubilize
precipitated proteins. The reactions were then centrifuged at 5000g for 10 min. The supernatant was retained, and the pellet
was treated with 100 μL of 10% SDS for resuspension of any remaining
precipitated proteins. The SDS was diluted to 1% with 1× PBS
(pH 7.4), and the solution was centrifuged again at 10 000g for 10 min. The two supernatants from each step were combined
and diluted to 10 mL with 1× PBS (pH 7.4). High-capacity neutravidin
resin (Thermo Fisher) was added to each sample and incubated rotating
overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the resin was washed once
with 1× PBS, twice with 6 M urea, twice with 1% SDS, and twice
with 1× PBS (pH 7.4). Proteins bound to the resin were eluted
either by incubation in SDS loading buffer at 95 °C for 5 min
or competitively with 3 mM d-biotin in 1× PBS.
