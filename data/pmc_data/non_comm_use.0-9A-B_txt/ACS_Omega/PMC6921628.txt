In this study, in situ exsolved Ni–Ba(Ce0.9Y0.1)0.8Ni0.2O3−δ+Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.9 (Ni–BCYN+GDC)
perovskite anode is studied for application in hydrocarbon-fueled
solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The electrocatalytic activities of the
oxidation reaction of anode in hydrogen and methane atmospheres are
studied. The results show that the surface-exsolved Ni nanoparticles
can significantly improve the electrochemical properties of the anode.
The polarization resistances of the studied anode in hydrogen and
methane atmospheres at 750 °C are as low as 0.0042 and 0.0054
Ω·cm–2, respectively. At the same time,
a 36 h short-term open-circuit voltage test under a methane atmosphere
confirms that the Ni–BCYN+GDC composite anode exhibits a good
carbon deposition resistance. These results demonstrate that the Ni–BCYN+GDC
composite anode is a potential novel anode material candidate for
hydrocarbon-fueled SOFC.

1 Introduction
Solid oxide fuel cell
(SOFC) can convert fuels’ chemical
energy into electricity with high efficiencies.1 SOFC has the advantage of fuel flexibility with wide fuel
options and can use hydrocarbons as fuel,2 and hydrocarbon fuels are much cheaper and easier to be prepared,
transported, and stored than hydrogen fuel. The conventional anode
material for SOFC is Ni-based cermet.3 The
Ni-based anodes4 have a high electrocatalytic
activity for H2 oxidation. However, Ni is prone to forming
carbon filaments by a mechanism that involves carbon deposition,5,6 dissolution into the Ni particles,7 precipitation
at the interface between the Ni particles and the substrate,8,9 and uplifting the Ni particles from the substrate.10,11 Therefore, novel alternative carbon-tolerant anode materials are
highly expected. Researchers have begun to study Ni-free metal oxide
based materials,12 such as La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ,13 La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3−δ,14 La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.8Ti0.2O3−δ,15 and BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3−δ.16 Although these materials have a better carbon tolerance, their electrochemical
performance and stability when using hydrocarbon fuels are not comparable
to those of Ni-based cermets.17 Then, improvements
in these anode materials have been attempted to enhance the electrochemical
performance18 through nanoparticle decoration.19,20 Apart from improving Ni-based cermet anodes, the modifications may
improve their carbon deposition resistance by impregnating nanoparticles
on Ni-based anodes. Li et al.21 studied
the Ni–GDC anode with impregnated BaCe0.9Yb0.1O3−δ (BCYb) nanoparticles and found
excellent carbon deposition resistance performance in methane. The
in situ exsolution of metal nanoparticles on ceramic anode has also
been investigated with enhanced electrochemical performance, such
as Ni–Sr0.95(Ti0.3Fe0.63Ni0.07)O3−δ-,22 FeNi3–Sr2FeMo0.65Ni0.35O6−δ-,23 and Ni–Ba(Zr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2)0.8Ni0.2O3−δ (BZCYN)-infiltrated
Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) anode.24 In situ exsolution can obtain ceramic anode
with a uniform distribution of metal nanoparticles and a larger reaction
three-phase interfaces;25 this anode has
excellent electrochemical performance.

BaCe0.9Y0.1 (BCY) has good oxygen ion and
proton conductivity, which is determined by the operating temperature
and working atmosphere.26 It has been reported
in the literature that the proton conductivity of BCY is beneficial
to the oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels.21 In this study, BCY is selected as the base perovskite phase to enhance
the chemical stability and carbon deposition resistance of anode.
Doping Ni into the B sites of the perovskite lattice of BCY can obtain
Ba(Ce0.9Y0.1)0.8Ni0.2O3−δ (BCYN), which has better electrocatalytic
activity for hydrocarbon oxidation; then, Ni is in situ exsolved on
BCYN by reduction. The exsolved Ni nanoparticles are in close contact
with the matrix BCYN with evenly distribution, which can improve the
catalytic performance of the anode and alleviate the formation of
carbon deposition.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Phase Structure
The phase composition
of the calcined BCY and BCYN powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD), as shown in Figure 1a. The XRD peaks of BCYN are consistent with the ICDD file
for BaCe0.9Y0.1, confirming the purity of BCY
phase without impure phase after calcination, which proves that Ni
is doped into the perovskite lattice of BCY. However, after BCYN was
reduced in 5% H2–N2 atmosphere for 8
h, the diffraction peaks of Ni appear, accompanied by those of BCY
phase, which can prove that Ni is exsolved from BCYN. The BCYN and
GDC powders were co-calcined at 1000 °C and tested by XRD. The
test results are shown in Figure 1b. The result shows that no heterogeneous phase other
than BCYN and GDC appears, and both BCYN and GDC are normal phases,
indicating that these two materials are chemically compatible.

of (a) BCYN and Ni–BCYN powders reduced in
5% H2–N2 for 8 h and (b) BCYN+GDC co-calcined
in air atmosphere at 1000 °C for 2 h.

2.2 Microstructure Characterization
Figure 2a is the cross-sectional
view of a symmetric cell supported by a GDC electrolyte. The GDC electrolyte
is densely sintered and in good contact with the electrodes, with
the thickness of about 230 μm. Figure 2b shows that the BCYN+GDC anode has the thickness
of ∼36 μm with well adherence to the electrolyte. Before
working in the reducing atmosphere, the BCYN+GDC anode grains show
a smooth surface. At the same time, the close connection between the
grains forms a porous anode structure (Figure 2c). For the reduced anode, many isolated
nanoparticles appear on smooth grains and grain boundaries (Figure 2d), which is related
to the exsolved Ni nanoparticles.

symmetric cell and (b) the BCYN+GDC anode; top-view of the BCYN+GDC
anode (c) before and (d) after reduction.

The electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) test was
conducted to further
investigate the distribution of Ni nanoparticles on the anode. It
can be seen from the EPMA result in Figure 3 that Ni is homogeneously dispersed on the
anode, and there is no O element around Ni element, so it can be concluded
that Ni exists as a simple substance, which combines the evidence
of the XRD patterns.

2.3 Symmetric Cell Performance in H2 and CH4
Figure 4 shows the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS)
of Ni–BCYN+GDC symmetric cells in wet H2 (with 3%
H2O) and CH4 (with 3% H2O), measured
under open-circuit voltage (OCV) condition at 600–750 °C.
The entire symmetric cell was placed in 5% H2–N2 reducing atmosphere for 8 h before testing.

Figure 4 EIS results of cell with
Ni–BCYN+GDC anode under (a) wet
H2 and (b) wet CH4 at 600–750 °C.

The high-frequency intercept of the impedance spectra
represents
the ohmic resistance (RΩ), which
mainly reflects the performance of the electrolyte. Polarization impedance
(RP) is the difference between low-frequency
and high-frequency resistances, which mainly reflects the performance
related to the electrode processes. Due to the electrochemical behavior
of thermal activation, all the impedances of the cell decrease with
increasing temperature. Figure 4a shows RΩ for the reaction
in wet H2, which is 1.05, 0.71, 0.54, and 0.34 Ω·cm–2 at 600–750 °C, respectively. The corresponding RP value in wet H2 is 0.034, 0.01,
0.0054, and 0.0042 Ω·cm–2, respectively.
The polarization impedance results are much smaller than those in
the references. Li et al.27 studied M-BZCYYb
anode and found the most excellent anode RP in H2 at 750 °C was about 0.064 Ω·cm–2. Song et al.24 studied
the BZCYN-infiltrated SDC anode and found that the polarization impedance
in H2 at 800 °C was 0.015 Ω·cm–2.

Figure 4b
is the
impedances of Ni–BCYN+GDC anode in a wet CH4 atmosphere.
The results are listed in Table 1. The values of RP for
the anode in wet CH4 are only about 0.055, 0.018, 0.008,
and 0.0054 Ω·cm–2 at 600–750 °C,
respectively. Compared with those of the anode working in a wet H2, RΩ and RP of the symmetric cells are basically the same order
of magnitude in two different atmospheres, and RP obtained in the two fuels is extremely small. It can be inferred
that the anode has excellent oxidation performance in methane.

Table 1 EIS Results of Cell with Ni–BCYN+GDC
Anode under Wet H2 and Wet CH4 at Different
Temperatures
 	temperature
(°C)	750	700	650	600	
H2	RΩ (Ω·cm–2)	0.50	0.57	0.67	0.96	
 	RP (Ω·cm–2)	0.0042	0.0054	0.01	0.034	
CH4	RΩ (Ω·cm–2)	0.34	0.54	0.71	1.05	
 	RP (Ω·cm–2)	0.0054	0.008	0.018	0.055	
It can be presumed that the Ni nanoparticles on the
anode can greatly
increase the active site reactive. Since the precipitated particles
are nanosized with a large specific surface area, more fuel gases
can be contacted per unit area, thereby greatly improving the catalytic
activity.

2.4 Full Cell Performance in H2 and
CH4
Figure 5a shows the open-circuit EIS of H2 (with 3% H2O) oxidation reaction on anode before and after reduction
at 750 °C, where the reduced curve is enlarged to an inset figure.
It can be found that RΩ decreases
dramatically due to the metal Ni particles exsolution on the anode
after reduction.27 The corresponding RΩ is 3.22 Ω·cm–2 before reduction but decreases to 1.02 Ω·cm–2 after reduction. The ohmic impedance is drastically reduced because
of the exsolution of Ni particles. Also, the values of RP are 0.25 and 1.50 Ω·cm–2 before and after reduction, respectively. The performance improvement
can be attributed to the Ni nanoparticles exsolved from the Ni–BCYN+GDC
anode matrix. The presence of the Ni nanoparticles not only increases
the catalytic activity but also increases the reactive sites, so that RP of the cell can be significantly reduced,
and the electrochemical performance is remarkably improved. The impedance
results fitted by the equivalent circuit R(R1Q1)(R2Q2) are listed in Table 2.

Figure 5b shows
EIS of the cell with BCYN+GDC anode measured in CH4 (with
3% H2O), where the reduced curve at 750 °C is enlarged
to an inset figure. The figure shows similar results as the cell measured
in H2 (with 3% H2O). The value of RP of the cell is 4.02 Ω·cm–2 at 750 °C before reduction but decreases sharply to 0.3 Ω·cm–2 after reduction. There is also a remarkable decrease
of RΩ from 4.15 to 1.18 Ω·cm–2 for the cell before and after reduction.

Figure 5c is the I–V curve of the cell with Ni–BCYN+GDC
anode measured in wet H2. Also, the OCV is around 0.78
V. The low OCV of GDC is due to the electronic conductivity of GDC
electrolyte at high temperature.28 The
maximum power density is about 22 and 91 mW·cm–2 at 750 °C before and after reduction, respectively. It can
be found that the output can increase more than 4 times after Ni nanoparticle
exsolution, which is consistent with the apparent decrease of RP after anode reduction.

Figure 5d is the I–V curve of the cell with Ni–BCYN+GDC
anode measured in wet CH4 (with 3% H2O) at 700
and 750 °C. It shows that the anode can improve the polarization
performance significantly. For cell with reduced anode, the maximum
power density is 80 mW·cm–2 at 750 °C,
which is higher than the cell with an unreduced anode. Similar change
can also be observed at 700 °C.

Nagamori et al.28 found that decrease
in the GDC electrolyte thickness from 600 to 30 μm could increase
its power density nearly 3 times. In this work, to ensure the reliability
of the operation, the electrolyte thickness is ∼540 μm.
Formally, due to such a thick electrolyte, the ohmic impedance is
extremely large, affecting the output performance. The thinner the
electrolyte layer, the better the cell performance that can be obtained.
At the same time, it is speculated that although the catalytic activity
of the nanoparticles on the fuel gas is very high, the conductivity
of the anode is insufficient due to the insufficient amount of exsolved
Ni particles, the network conduction system is not formed, and the
electrons cannot be efficiently transported, resulting in low peak
power density.

2.5 Carbon Resistance of the Cell in Wet CH4
The carbon resistance of the Ni–BCYN+GDC
anode was further studied in wet CH4 (with 3% H2O) at 750 °C under OCV. Compared with condition under the applied
current, the anode under OCV is more likely to deposit carbon because
the oxygen ions from the cathode under OCV cannot oxidize the carbon
deposited on the anode, nor can it generate carbon-resistant water
on the anode surface.29

It can be
found that OCV gradually decreases from 0.81 to 0.74 V at the initial
test period and tends to become stable around 0.78 V for 36 h (Figure 6a), consistent with
the reported OCV trend with methane fuel.23,30 OCV is related to the volumetric partial pressure of the anode surface
gas.31 Methane is not directly combined
with oxygen ions; instead, it is catalytically decomposed before the
working electrode participating in the reaction and is mainly decomposed
into H2 and partially converted into CO. Since the methane
fuel is not fully catalytically decomposed, the partial pressure of
H2 on the anode surface decreases, resulting in the decrease
of OCV and performance, which is consistent with the previously measured I–V curve.

with Ni–BCYN+GDC anode in wet CH4 under OCV at 750
°C for 36 h. (b) Raman spectra and
(c) SEM micrograph of the anode after short-term test in wet CH4 at 750 °C for 36 h under OCV.

SEM morphology analysis and Raman spectroscopy
test were conducted
about the cell after 36 h of short-term testing. The results are shown
in Figure 6. In Raman
spectra (Figure 6b),
it can be seen that the peaks at 1350 and 1580 cm–1 associated with graphite are absent. Figure 6c shows the micrograph of the anode after
being tested in wet CH4 for 36 h and that no carbon fibers
can be found on the surface. These results confirm that Ni in situ
exsolved BCYN+GDC anode is stable during 36 h test without carbon
deposition.

3 Conclusions
In situ exsolved Ni-decorated
Ba(Ce0.9Y0.1)0.8Ni0.2O3−δ perovskite
is studied as a composite anode for hydrocarbon-fueled SOFC. In the
oxidation reaction of hydrogen and methane at 750 °C, the anode
exhibits excellent electrochemical activity. The polarization resistances
of the anode in a symmetrical cell are 0.0042 and 0.0054 Ω·cm–2 in wet H2 and wet CH4, respectively.
The composite anode also exhibits good resistant to carbon deposition
even under OCV test environment where carbon deposition is more likely
to occur in short term. The research work verifies that in situ exsolved
Ni–BCYN+GDC composite anode is a potential novel anode candidate
with good carbon resistance and electrochemical properties for hydrocarbon-fueled
SOFC.

4 Experimental Section
BCYN powders with
the composition of Ba(Ce0.9Y0.1)0.8Ni0.2O3−δ were
prepared by the sol–gel process. All raw materials were from
Sinopharm, Shanghai. Ba(NO3)2, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, Y(NO3)3·6H2O, and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O are used as starting materials. All compounds are first
dissolved in deionized water and then ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) complexing agent is added to form a gel. Then, the as-prepared
gel is dried and calcined at 1000 °C for 3 h to obtain BCYN powders.
The BaCe0.9Y0.1 (BCY) powders as a reference
were also prepared in the same manner. Then, BCYN powders were reduced
in 5% H2–N2 at 750 °C for 8 h to
study the exsolution properties of the compounds. BCYN and Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.9 (GDC) powders were mixed
in a weight ratio of 1:1 and calcined at 1000 °C for 2 h to determine
their chemical compatibility by XRD test. To prepare the composite
anode, BCYN and GDC powders were mixed at a weight ratio of 6:4 using
ball milling in ethanol. The cathode used is composed of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ (LSCF) and GDC. The preparation process can be referred to in our
previous works.32

The GDC electrolyte
supported symmetric cells and full cells (Φ12
mm × 1 mm) were made by the molding and sintering process. The
GDC powders were ball-milled in ethanol and then molded into a pellet
and sintered at 1550 °C for 5 h. The area of the BCYN+GDC anode
is 0.5 cm2 for symmetric cells. For the symmetric cells,
the BCYN and GDC mixing slurry was screen-printed on the both sides
of the mechanically polished electrolyte and sintered at 1000 °C
in air for 2 h. For the full cell preparation, the same process was
used to print the anode only on one side of the electrolyte, while
LSCF+GDC composite cathode was prepared by slurry painting using 70
wt % LSCF and 30 wt % GDC, followed by sintering at 1000 °C for
2 h. The active areas of both full cells are 0.2 cm2.

Pt paste (Sino-Platinum Metals Co.) was painted on the anode and
cathode for current collection for electrochemical measurement. A
glass sealant (Ceramabond, Aremco Product Inc.) was used to seal the
cells onto an Al2O3 tube. A 5% H2–N2 mixing gas was used to reduce the anodes in
situ at 750 °C for 8 h prior to the electrochemical measurements.
An electrochemical interface (Solartron 1287) and an impedance/gain
phase analyzer (Solartron 1260) were adopted for the measurements.
The initial EIS in wet H2 (with 3% H2O) or wet
CH4 (with 3% H2O), and current density–voltage–power
density (I–V–P) curves in wet CH4 were obtained
at 600–750 °C. The carbon deposition resistant performance
of the anode was studied in wet CH4 (with 3% H2O) under OCV at 750 °C.

Phase composition was examined
using X-ray diffraction (XRD, XRD-7000).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, GeminiSEM300), environmental scanning
electron microscopy (ESEM, Quanta 200), and electron probe microanalysis
(EPMA-8050G) were used to analyze the morphology and composition.
Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR800) was used to detect carbon deposition.
