We apply the string
method to the self-consistent mean-field theory
framework of the rod–coil block copolymer system to calculate
the minimum energy pathways in the rearrangement transitions of lamellae
and cylinders with different orientations under certain epitaxial
growth relationship. Metastable phases appearing in the reordering
transition pathway tend to form the structure at low χN side of the order–order
transition boundary compared with the initial phase. In particular,
for complex network, metastable phases, such as single gyroid and
perforated lamellae, need to select a rearrangement transition between
lamellae or cylinders near the order–disorder transition boundary
with the same epitaxial growth relationship but different orientations.
It is confirmed that this strategy for obtaining complex metastable
phases by rational design of rearrangement transition between specific
phases in the phase diagram can be applied to a wide range of χN as well as the coil–coil block copolymer system.
We further investigate the rearrangement transition behavior combining
with the analysis of contribution from the free energy, entropy, degree
of mixing between different blocks, and the average orientation degree
of rods during the phase transitions. Based on this mechanism, we
have developed a target-directed design strategy for constructing
self-assembled metastable structures of rod–coil block copolymers.

Introduction
Block
copolymer melt and solution systems have been studied as
classic self-assembled materials for many years due to their simple
preparation methods, good mechanical properties, and abundant periodic
ordered microphase separated structures.1−5 Various means cause the self-assembly behavior of block copolymer
systems to be more complicated and diverse, such as increasing the
number of different chemical blocks,6,7 changing the
rigidity of blocks,8 regulating the block
sequence distribution and chain topologies (linear,9 star,10,11 comb,12 and ring chains10), and blending with
different types of polymers13 and nanoparticles.14 Among them, the block copolymer that contains
a certain chain rigidity has great applications in many fields, including
light-emitting diodes (LEDs),15 polymer
solar cells,16 and high-modulus polymer.17 Research studies on the block copolymer with
rigid chains have attracted more and more attention, which is formed
by covalently linking two different rigidity blocks, such as semiconductor
polymers with the conjugate structure of π–π,18−20 block copolymers containing aromatic groups,21,22 liquid crystal polymers,23−25 and various biological macromolecules.26−29 In contrast to coil–coil block copolymers, the block copolymer
with rigid chains has a large geometrical asymmetry effect between
different rigidity blocks and the strong anisotropic orientation interaction
between rigid segments, as shown in Figure 1. As a result, the theoretical studies on
the block copolymer containing rigid blocks are still undeveloped
due to its complicated structures and wider parameter space.30−33 There are more and more work on the self-assembly of block copolymers
with rigid segments experimentally. For example, it is found that
the complex phenomenon of multistage self-assembly occurs under the
existence of external field.34 Recent experiments
show that introducing a side methyl group and a methyl group at junctions
between rods and the coil blocks can prepare cylinder phases and perforated
lamellar phases in solution and bulk.35 The coil–rod–coil triblock terpolymer can self-assemble
into complex network structures such as double diamond, single gyroid,
and double primitive in solution systems.36 Wiesner et al. used the coil–rod–coil block polymer
with a unique self-assembly character and good physical properties
to prepare the gyroid framework, which has excellent optical and electrical
properties.37,38

distribution function of flexible
segments and rigid segments, respectively. Similarly, qA*(r, f – s) and qB*(r, u,1 – s) represent the flexible
segments and rigid segments probability distribution function from
the other side of the copolymer chain.

The self-consistent mean-field theory (SCFT), first proposed by
Edwards,39 is one of the most accurate
theories on the mesoscopic scale to investigate the thermodynamic
equilibrium state behaviors. The main idea of this approach is to
simplify the multibody complex interaction in the practical polymer
system into a situation where a single polymer chain is in the average
field generated by others. The SCFT has been successfully employed
to investigate the equilibrium phase behavior for the self-assembly
of block copolymers with various chain architectures in bulk and under
confinement.40 Most theoretical works to
date have been concentrated on the thermodynamic equilibrium self-assembly
of block copolymers. However, the self-assembly behavior in practical
applications is very complicated. The properties required for these
materials inevitably involve nonequilibrium states, which are often
a critical factor in determining the ultimate performance of the material.
First, the block copolymer itself has high molecular weight, high
polydispersity and thus long relaxation time, wide relaxation time
spectrum, and high viscosity. It is difficult to reach the thermodynamic
equilibrium state in experimental timescale, but the system is always
trapped in some metastable phases. For example,
the perforated lamellae (PL) have often been found in the transition
pathway between different phases in experiments and have long-term
stability.41−43 Furthermore, the processing conditions of practical
polymer systems are very complicated. The presence of external field
such as the magnetic field,44 pressure
field,45 and shear field46 during processing usually causes phase morphology changes,
including the orientation of rods and the order–order transition
(OOT), leading to more complex metastable phases. Recently, experiments
by Kim et al. showed that different thermodynamic processing conditions
will induce the appearance of complex metastable structures.47 The phase transition also occurs under large
amplitude oscillatory shearing in the block copolymer system.48 Finally, in evolution, the molecular topologies
considered by theoretical calculations are more and more complex,
and thus, the equilibrium or metastable self-assembled phases are
also more and more abundant.49 In particular,
the difference in free energy between different metastable structures
is quite small in most cases, and weak fluctuations may induce phase
transitions. Therefore, these complex metastable phases are often
observed experimentally. For rod–coil block copolymers, the
phase transition kinetics is even more complicated due to the effect
of the geometrical asymmetry and the orientation interaction, which
is a huge challenge for both experimental and theoretical work.50

It is obvious that abundant and complex
phase structures occur
in the phase transition path and thus focusing on the dynamic information
of the self-assembly process of block copolymers is more important,
rather than the thermodynamic equilibrium state. In other words, some
metastable structures in the self-assembly path have long-term stability
and thus have easily been observed in experiments. The string method
is exactly a powerful tool for investigating the kinetic information
of phase transitions, such as minimum energy pathway (MEP). Our previous
work has obtained the phase transition pathway of single networks
for rod–coil block copolymers via matching the epitaxial growth
relationship and employing SCFT combining with the string method.51 However, this work shows that only under the
condition of exact epitaxial growth and certain parameters, such as
the reordering transition pathway between {110} lamellae with χN = 13, μN = 13, and β = 2,
the target single network will appear as a long-term stability metastable
phase in the rearrangement transition pathway. Obviously, it is still
difficult to construct the target structure via designing kinetic
pathways. In this work, based on the SCFT calculations for the phase
diagram of 3D self-assembly structure, we focus on the rod–coil
copolymer rearrangement transition mechanism and guide the target-directed
design by searching for the kinetic pathway between specific phases.
We calculate the χN – f phase diagram for the rod–coil block copolymer with β
= 2 and μN = 10 and confirm the target rearrangement
transition pathway by combining the epitaxial relationship and phase
diagram. Based on this method, we achieve constructing single gyroid
(SG) and tetragonally packed cylinders from reordering transition
between {110} lamellae and PL and body-centered cubic spheres from
reordering transition between <111> cylinders in the rod–coil
block copolymers. We systematically study the contribution from the
entropy, contacting degree, and orientation during the reordering
transitions and find that rod–coil block copolymers have a
natural advantage in constructing complex network structures. In particular,
the application scope of the target design strategy is further presented.

Theory
and Computation Methods
SCFT for Rod–Coil Block Copolymers
The SCFT
based on the rod–coil chain model is the most suitable theoretical
model for studying the thermodynamic equilibrium behavior on the mesoscopic
scale. Here, we merely briefly show the SCFT of rod–coil blocks.
Consider an incompressible rod–coil diblock copolymer system
consisting of n identical copolymer chains with a
volume of V. Each coil block contains NA segments of statistical segment length a, and each rod block has NB segments
of statistical segment length b, where b = lR/NB with lR of each rod block length. For simplicity,
assuming that rigid and flexible segments have the same bulk number
density ρ0(ρ0 = nN/V), where N ≡ NA + NB, denoting each block
copolymer chain length. Obviously, the volume fraction of each coil
block is f = NA/N, and the rod block is 1 – f. In
the SCFT, the variable s (in unit length of N) parameterizes the chain length of diblock copolymers,
where s = 0 indicates the beginning of the Gaussian
chain, s = f indicates the junction
point of the two blocks, and s = 1 is the end of
the rod block. Also, we introduce a parameter β to define a
geometrical asymmetry between rigid and flexible blocks,52, indicating the shape of rods
(length-to-diameter
ratio). The rods are slender when the β is large, and on the
contrary, the small β corresponds to stubby rods.

As the
detail of SCFT method of rod–coil copolymer was first proposed
by Pryamitsyn and Ganesan53 and has been
described in our previous study,52 we ignore
the SCFT equations for rod–coil blocks and only show the system’s
single-chain free energy  1  where
ϕA(r) and ϕB(r) represent the normalized
segmental density of coil and rod segments, respectively; ωA(r) and ωB(r) are
the potential field conjugated to the density of coil and rod segments,
respectively; χ is the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter; M(r) is the orientation field conjugated to the
average orientation order parameter T(r);
the Maier–Saupe parameter μ indicates the orientation
interaction between rods; η(r) is used to guarantee
the incompressibility condition of the system.

The single-chain
free energy of the system can be divided into
three parts: the interfacial energy , entropy , and orientation interaction energy . 2   3   4  where the orientation interaction
energy −Forien is based on the
Maier–Saupe interaction, with the μ value reflecting
the degree of orientation between rods. When the orientation interaction
energy is relatively large, the rigid blocks arrangement tends to
be chaotic. The single chain partition function Q satisfies 5  where propagator qA(r, s) corresponds to the
flexible segments probability distribution function, which indicates
the probability of finding a coil segment of s that
starts from the coil end (where s = 0) anywhere in
the system and ends at position r (0 ≤ s < f). It satisfies a modified diffusion
equation of the Gaussian chain, and the initial value is qA(r,0) = 1, as shown in Figure 1. Similarly, qA*(r, f – s) represents the
probability of finding the coil segment s that starts
from the rod–coil junction (s = f) and ends at position r (0 ≤ s < f). We solve the modified diffusion equation
according to the Gaussian chain with the pseudospectral method54 and use the fast Fourier transform to calculate
the density and the orientation order parameters of rigid segments.

To numerically solve SCFT equations of the rod–coil system
stably and accurately, we use the icosahedron triangular mesh method
to deal with the orientation discretization of rods.55 This method disperses the orientation angle on the surface
of the unit sphere uniformly and does integrals on the sphere, which
can improve the numerical stability for solving SCFT equations. We
use the semi-implicit relaxation scheme proposed by Man et al.56 for field iteration, which speeds up the convergence
of the field and improves the numerical stability during the operational
process. Semi-implicit relaxation scheme, also known as semi-implicit
seidel (SIS), is proven to be more efficient and stable in studying
the phase behavior of two polymer blends comparing to conventional
explicit iterative methods.57,58 For the calculation
of the rod–block concentration and orientation order parameter,
we utilize the translation properties of the Fourier transform and
adopt parallel computing in the Fourier space.59

String Method
The string method,
first proposed by
E, Ren, and Vanden–Eijnden,60−62 is conveniently used
to study the phase transition between metastable or stable phases
for block copolymers. It is independent of our preunderstanding of
the system dynamics and can obtain some kinetic information such as
MEP based on the study of the free energy landscape.51,63−65 The metastable phases appearing in the reordering
transition located in the valley of the free energy landscape and
the maximum value of the MEP corresponds to the free energy barrier
of transition. The valley of the free energy landscape can occupy
a large range, which make the metastable phases easy to be obtained.
Here, we embed the SCFT into the string method to explore the phase
transition process between two different structures (including morphology
and free energy) obtained by the SCFT (set as M and N), with free energy of F0 and F1, corresponding to two ends of the string.
The MEP is a string τ in the free energy landscape connecting
two initial phases M and N. It can
constraint the free energy of systems to decrease only along a direction
perpendicular to the string. Besides, we apply an equal arc length
during the iterative process to ensure that the order parameters of
the density between adjust phases on the string have the same difference,
preventing metastable phases on the string from converging to the
local minimum value during the iterative process. We use cubic spline
interpolation to achieve this limit in this study, and specific implementation
processes are described by E et al.66 The
distance between all adjacent order parameters ϕi(r) and ϕi – 1(r) is defined here as di – 1, i (i = 1,2, ..., n) 6  where i is
the discrete point of the string. For the rod–coil copolymer
system, we need at least two order parameters to determine a state
of the system: the chemical potential field ωA(r) or ωB(r) and the orientation
field M(r) for rigid blocks or their density
order parameter and the orientation order parameter that are conjugated
to the field. Therefore, the equal arc length limit above should be
applied to the two order parameters. It is worth noting that ϕA(r), ϕB(r), η(r), and M(r) are not fully coupled
before the self-consistent mean-field iteration reaches the equilibrium
state, indicating that they can change independently of each other.
In fact, we do not need to impose the equal arc length limit on too
many order parameters for the numerical calculation stability. In
this study, the equal arc length limit of two order parameters such
as ϕA(r) and M(r) has found a balance between the accuracy and computational costs
during the string iteration process, and the final MEP will not change
with excessive equal arc length limit of other order parameters.

By calculation of the SCFT, the order parameters of two ends of the
string ϕM and ϕN are known, and
we can initialize the order parameters of each discrete point along
the string by combining the order parameters in different ways according
to different requirements. In this study, we mainly focus on metastable
phases along the possible transition pathways in which the order parameters
of each state along the string change simultaneously in the whole
calculation cell. So, the initial fields of each state on the string
are set to evolve gradually in the whole box from M to N 7  where n is
the number of discrete points of the string, with n = 40 in this work to ensure the computational efficiency and stability.
After each structure on the string is set up, the order parameters
of each state are input as initial value in the SCFT followed by iteration
steps. After certain iterations, the equal arc length limit is applied
to the string by cubic spline interpolation mentioned above. Constant
iteration and adjustment of the string were applied until it finally
converges to the MEP on which each point is a metastable phase that
may appear on the transition pathways between the initial phases M and N.

Initial Fields and Unit
Cell Parameters Setting
There
are numerous metastable phases due to the anisotropic orientation
interaction and the geometrical asymmetry between rods and coil blocks
in the rod–coil system. These metastable phases are very sensitive
to the setting of initial fields and unit cell parameters in the SCFT
calculations. Different initial fields may directly lead to different
metastable or stable phases that correspond to an optimum unit cell
size, and larger or smaller unit cell size will increase the overall
free energy of the system. Here, we construct the initial field through
real space,67 using the strong segregation
boundary (namely infinitely sharp) between two adjacent phase domains,
where the concentration is set to 0 or 1. In this way, we can obtain
various candidate phases according to the symmetry of target phases.
Finally, all candidate phases are brought into the SCFT calculations
with multiple sets of iterative operations to obtain the converged
solution. Moreover, to reduce the confinement effect of computational
cell size, a series of the unit cell size is performed to each candidate
state to find the free energy corresponding to the optimal unit cell
size, that is, the minimum free energy Fmin of the candidate phase under the parameter condition. By comparing Fmin among all candidate phases, the phase with
the smallest Fmin is the most stable at
the selected parameter, and the remaining candidate phases are all
metastable structures in the free energy landscape.

Results and Discussion
Various experiments have focused on the self-assembled structures
of block copolymers with rigid chains due to their potential applications
in organic optoelectronics.34 But three-dimensional
self-assembled structures of rigid rods and semiflexible block copolymers
are still relatively undeveloped theoretically,50,68 which mainly focused on the study of lamellae,69 the self-assembly behavior without orientation interactions68 and theoretical calculation of the liquid crystal
behavior under two-dimensional conditions.70 One of the key factors behind this gap is the existence of the orientation
interaction and the geometrical asymmetry between the rigid and flexible
blocks, which makes numerical solution difficult to resolve or extremely
unstable. The orientation interaction drives the rigid or semirigid
blocks to be arranged in parallel along a specific direction, resulting
in liquid crystal behavior, which becomes more prominent in the case
of larger orientation interactions. Furthermore, the geometrical asymmetry
between rods and coil blocks leads to the formation of large packing
frustration in the rod–coil system. As a result, there is no
complete study on the phase diagram and metastable phases for the
rod–coil system so far, which is important for studying the
transition mechanism between different phases.

According to
the method of initial fields and unit cell parameters
setting in Theory and Computation Methods,
we consider the body-centered cube sphere (BCC),A15 phase (simple
Frank–Kasper structure), hexagonal packed cylinders, tetragonally
packed cylinders, double gyroid phase (DG), and lamellae as candidate
phases for our calculations. Based on the precision of χN = 0.1 and f = 0.05, the rod–coil
phase diagram of χN – f under β = 2 and μN = 10 is calculated,
as shown in Figure 2, where G represents the double gyroid phase, C represents the hexagonal
packed cylinder, S represents the simple spherical phase, and L represents
the lamellar phase. We drop off the data points for calculating the
phase boundary to make the phase diagram clear.

Figure 2 χN – f phase diagram
of the rod–coil system under β = 2 and μN = 10 based on the precision of χN = 0.1 and f = 0.05, and the data points for calculating
the phase boundary are omitted to make the phase diagram clearer.
The blue bold dot represents the parameter near the cylinder–lamella
phase transition point and the blue hollow dot represents the parameter
near the disorder–lamella phase transition point. The red bold
triangles represent the parameter near the disorder–cylinder
phase transition point and the red hollow triangles represent the
parameter near the sphere–cylinder phase transition point.

Rod–coil block copolymers differ from the
coil–coil
blocks in the orientation interaction and the geometrical asymmetry
both of which cause the shape of phase diagram to change. Instead
of the perfect symmetrical phase diagram of the coil–coil diblocks,
the disorder–lamella transition point in the phase diagram
is moved from the coil volume fraction f = 0.5 to
a range between f = 0.6 and f =
0.65, which is also consistent with previous studies about the effect
of orientation interactions and the geometrical asymmetry on the phase
behavior of the rod–coil system.52,68,71,72 From χN – f phase diagram of rod–coil
blocks in the case of low-orientation interaction, we can see that
a double continuous network structure DG appears in spite of complicated
structures caused by the geometrical asymmetry and the orientation
interaction. In the part of f ≤ 0.6, with
the increase of the rigid composition, the proportion of DG in the
phase diagram is larger, which is in sharp contrast to the coil–coil
system.33 The main reason behind this phenomenon
is the packing frustration. When complex networks formed, the excessive
stretching caused by packing frustration is alleviated because the
rods have less conformational entropy loss,33 which is beneficial for the formation of complex network structures.
In the phase diagram as shown in Figure 2, most of the area is still occupied by the
lamellae and the cylinders, which is consistent with our previous
findings.52

Masten have found that
in the process of the phase transition between
different phases, there will be a specific epitaxial growth relationship.73,74 Wang et al. also found that the epitaxial relationship originates
from the matching of the dominant Fourier components of the structures.75 According to our previous study on applying
the string method to explore the phase transition pathway and the
free-energy barrier of critical nuclei, the transition difficulty
and occurrence of metastable phases are closely related to the epitaxial
growth relationship between initial phases.51,64,76 When the space symmetry group and reciprocal
lattice vectors are well matched, a small-scale adjustment occurs
in the transition process, resulting in the phase transition being
easy to achieve. Different self-assembled phases can belong to the
same space group, but different phases with the same space group are
usually distinguished by the reciprocal lattice vector with the strongest
signal, that is, the main peak in the light scattering experiment.77

In experiments, continuous annealing can
realize the reordering
transition between lamellae or cylinders with different orientations.78 In the film-confined system, the phenomenon
that lamellae or cylinders with different orientations coexist has
been observed,79 which is expected to be
more complex in three-dimensional space. Here, we use crystallographic
planes and crystallographic directions to denote the orientations
of the lamellar and cylindrical phases.64 Crystallographic planes and crystallographic directions are represented
by three integers h, l, and k, namely, the Miller indices.80 According to our previous work,51 the
rearrangement transition pathway between different orientation lamellae
of {110} and {111} crystallographic plane group at the parameters
of f = 0.65, χN = 13, β
= 2, and μN = 13 was investigated, and single
gyroid (SG) and single diamond (SD) phases were found as the metastable
structures. Combined with the phase diagram of rod–coil block
copolymers, we find that single network phases appear around the disorder–lamella
phase transition point. To confirm this, namely the influence of the
selected location in the phase diagram on the reordering transition
pathway, we study the rearrangement transition pathway between {110}
lamellae with different orientations at the disorder–lamella
phase transition point and the cylinder–lamella phase transition
point, which correspond to f = 0.65, χN = 13, β = 2, and μN = 10
and f = 0.45, χN = 16, β
= 2, and μN = 10, respectively. The exact position
of these parameters in the phase diagram is shown as the blue hollow
and bold dots in Figure 2, where the blue hollow dot identifies the point near disorder–lamella
phase transition and the blue bold dot represents the point near cylinder–lamella
phase transition.

As shown in Figure 3, it is found that in the reordering transition
pathway of {110}
lamellae with different orientations, the SG appears under the parameter
of f = 0.65, and the tetragonally packed cylinder
occurs under the parameter of f = 0.45 instead of
SG. According to the research on applying spatial symmetry group theory
to the SCFT by Jiang et al.,77 both SG
and the tetragonally packed cylinder belong to the same epitaxial
growth relationship of the {110} crystallographic plane group. In
addition, we find that the metastable phases appearing in the reordering
transition pathway of different orientation {110} lamellae tend to
form the structure at the low χN side of the
phase boundary comparing to lamellae. For example, cylinders appear
in the rearrangement transition near the cylinder–lamella phase
transition point, while SG appears near the disorder–lamella
phase transition point. It was reported that the disorder phase can
be described as a set of complex network structures.81,82 It is anticipated that in the rearrangement transition of different
orientation lamellae, the metastable phases are related to the epitaxial
growth relationship of initial lamellae and the selected parameter
location in the phase diagram. Therefore, if we want to get SG structures,
we can design a reordering pathway between lamellae with the same
epitaxial growth relationship of SG, and parameters should be selected
around the disorder–lamellae boundary.

Figure 3 (a) Reordering transition
pathway between {110} lamellae in the
rod–coil block copolymers with SG being encountered under f = 0.65, χN = 13, β = 2, and
μN = 10 (b) and with tetragonally packed cylinders
being encountered under f = 0.45, χN = 16, β = 2, and μN = 10.

To further determine if this relationship merely
occurs in the
lamellar phase rearrangement transition, near the sphere–cylinder
(f = 0.45, χN = 11 and f = 0.75, χN = 17) and disorder–cylinder
phase transition points (f = 0.55, χN = 11 and f = 0.7, χN = 14) on both sides of the disorder–lamella phase transition
point with same β = 2 and μN = 10, we
calculate the reordering transition pathways of different orientation
cylinders with <111> crystallographic direction using the string
method, as shown in Figure 4, where red structures represent the change of the coil blocks
and blue structures indicate the change of the rigid blocks. It is
found that the results are in good agreement with our expectations.
BCC with rods as the minority domain appears in the rearrangement
transition pathway between <111> cylinders at f = 0.75 and with coil segments as the minority domain at f = 0.45. Similarly, PL with rods and flexible segments
as the minority domain respectively appears at f =
0.7 and f = 0.55. Compared with the lamellar phase,
the concentration distribution of cylinders is too dispersive with
more independent domains. Therefore, it is more difficult to form
SG in the rearrangement transition pathway of <111> crystallographic
direction cylinders. At f = 0.7, PL with rod blocks
as the minority domain is unstable, and it is easy to transform into
a lamellar structure in the manner of spinodal. However, even if SG
does not appear, PL still has some characteristics of complex network
structures, which has the same epitaxial growth relationship of the
<111> crystallographic direction. Obviously, the result also
shows
that the above conclusion is not only applicable to the lamellar phase
but also to the cylindrical phase rearrangement transition both of
which occupy the most area of the phase diagram in the rod–coil
system and are easy to be obtained.

Figure 4 Reordering transition pathways between
<111> cylinders with
BCC being encountered in the rod–coil block copolymers under
(a) f = 0.45, χN = 11, and
β = 2 and (c) f = 0.75, χN = 17, and β = 2. Reordering transition pathways between <111>
cylinders with PL being encountered in the rod–coil block copolymers
under (b) f = 0.55, χN = 11,
and β = 2 and (d) f = 0.7, χN = 14, and β = 2. The red structures in (a) and (b) represent
the density of coil segments, and the blue structures in (c) and (d)
represent the density of rigid blocks. Parameters of four reordering
transitions are in Figure 2, represented by bold and hollow triangles.

We believe that the mechanism for this kind of transformation
is
that the system has undergone the process of distortion, fracture,
and reorganization during the rearrangement transition of cylinders
and lamellae with different orientations. The symmetry of initial
phases is destroyed in the reordering transition and thus the system
tends to form morphologies with large entropy and high interface area.
To further understand this mechanism, we analyze the corresponding
changes of the entropy  (eq 2), the contacting
degree between rods and coil segments , and the average orientation
degree of
rods M. Here, we use the order parameter S̃(r) = 3/2 × λmax(r) to indicate the degree of orientation, and the average
orientation degree of rods is defined as M = ∫ S̃(r)dVrod/Vrod, where Vrod is the domain volume of rods and λmax(r) represents the maximum eigenvalue of matrix tensor S(r).53 The degree of contacting
between rods and coil segments  can be defined as81 8  

The above
parameters are plotted against the string contour parameter
α, as shown in Figure 5; squares and circles indicate the changes in the rearrangement
transition pathway of {110} lamellae with different orientations under f = 0.45 and f = 0.65, which are represented
by transition I and transition II, respectively. The remaining triangles
represent the changes in the rearrangement transition pathway of <111>
crystallographic direction cylinders under f = 0.45, f = 0.55, f = 0.7, and f = 0.75 and are expressed as transition III to transition VI. It
can be seen from Figure 5a that in most cases, the total entropy of systems increases in the
reordering transition pathway. Interestingly, when a complex network
structure appears in the transition such as SG in the transition II
and PL in the transitions IV and V, the entropy of systems decreases
in the rearrangement transition pathway. This phenomenon occurs mainly
because the complex network structure has large packing frustration,
and its entropy stretching directly leads to more entropy loss of
the system.33 Nevertheless, the rigid block
itself in the rod–coil system has no conformational entropy,
so the entropy loss caused by this entropy stretching is alleviated,
and complex network structures still appear in the transition. Figure 5b shows the changes
in the degree of contacting between rods and coil blocks during the
six rearrangement transitions. It is similar to Figure 5a that the degree of contacting increases
in most transitions but slightly decreases in the transitions II,
IV, and V where the complex network structures appear. With the entropy
stretching caused by packing frustration increasing, the extent of
interpenetration between coil blocks and rigid blocks decreases and
thus reducing the contacting degree between rods and coils.

of the variation of the five small-amplitude average orientation degrees
in (c).

From Figure 5c,d,
the trend of average orientation degree in the six rearrangement transitions
can be obtained. It is clear that the changes of the average orientation
degree are small, where the change in the transition I is one order
of magnitude smaller than the change in its entropy, and even worse,
the rest of the rearrangement transitions are three or four orders
of magnitude smaller than the change in their entropy. To ensure the
numerical stability during the calculation process, we choose a smaller
μN, which leads to a smaller orientation degree
of rods, but even so, the rod blocks still maintain a certain degree
of parallel arrangement, as shown in Figure 6. Although the variation of the average orientation
degree is small, its changes are very interesting. Similar to the
change in the entropy and the degree of contacting between rods and
coil segments, the average orientation degree of transitions I, III,
and VI decreases in the reordering transition, which leads to a raise
in free energy, indicating that the rod blocks tend to be chaotically
arranged and the system tends to increase the orientation entropy
during the rearrangement transition. Although the average orientation
degree of transitions II, IV, and V increases during the rearrangement
transition, which is the same as special changes in the entropy and
the degree of contacting, we believe that this change is related to
the complex network structure that emerges in the transition. To illustrate
this, we have drawn the three-dimensional structure of metastable
complex networks in transitions II and IV, two-dimensional visual
orientation tensor field of rod blocks along the Z axis direction S(r), the concentration
and the orientation degree distribution map of rods, as shown in Figure 6. We use the order
parameter S̃(r) to indicate the
degree of orientation, and the black dotted lines in the figures show
the location of nodes in complex network structures, where the orientation
degree of rods is lower. From Figure 6b,f, we can find that rod blocks from different branches
converge at nodes with different orientations, which results in a
disorder orientation state of rods at nodes. The complex network phase
has a high packing frustration, which leads to the entropy stretching
of rod blocks.33 Furthermore, this entropy
stretching process is beneficial to the ordered parallel arrangement
of rod blocks without conformational entropy, thus increasing the
orientation degree of rods around nodes. So, this special behavior
in the rod–coil system can alleviate the entropy loss in complex
network structures, which is consistent with our conclusion that the
orientation interaction of rod blocks is at some extent beneficial
to the formation of complex network structures in the rod–coil
phase diagram.

(b) Visual orientation tensor field S(r)

(a). (c) Concentration distribution and (d) orientation degree of
rods in two dimensions, which has the same direction as (b). (a),
(b), (c), and (d) are SG in the reordering transition pathway between
{110} lamellae at f = 0.65, χN = 13, β = 2, and μN = 10. (e), (f),
(g), and (h) represent the same content as (a), (b), (c), and (d)
but are PL in the reordering transition pathway between <111>
crystallographic
direction cylinders at f = 0.55, χN = 11, β = 2, and μN = 10. The black
dotted lines are the network nodes.

As analyzed above, we can see that metastable phases appearing
in the reordering transition pathway are closely related to the structure
at the low χN side of the phase boundary compared
with initial phases. When the initial phases at both ends of the string
are near the OOT (the initial phase is at the high χN side of the phase boundary), for example, near the sphere–cylinder
transition point and the cylinder–lamella transition point,
the entropy and the degree of blending between rods and coil blocks
in the rod–coil block copolymer increase in the reordering
transition pathways between cylinders or lamellae with different orientations,
and the metastable phase tends to form the sphere and cylinder. When
initial phases are near the order–disorder transition (ODT),
the metastable phases in the reordering transition pathway will form
complex network structures that can be used to describe the disorder
phase.81 Unlike the coil–coil system,
due to the special existence of rods, the orientation interaction
and the nonconformational entropy of rod–coil can alleviate
the packing frustration of complex network structures, which makes
the complex networks composed of the rod–coil block copolymer
easier to be discovered in experiments. Moreover, the rod–coil
system has higher selectivity for experimental conditions, and the
complex networks formed with rods have applications in the fields
of 3D photonic crystals and the like.

We need to consider the
scope of application after understanding
the mechanism of the reordering transition, including the parameter
and the chemical components, to determine whether there is a higher
practical value. So, taking {110} lamellae rearrangement transition
under f = 0.65, β = 2, and μN = 10 as an example, we calculate a series of reordering transitions
with χN changing from 12 to 17, as shown in Figure 7 and Table 1. Two characteristic free energy
barriers are defined here. ΔF represents the
single-chain free energy difference between the valley and the barrier
in the rearrangement transition pathway. The larger ΔF means the longer stability of the metastable phase. In
addition, F1 indicates the single-chain
free energy barrier in the rearrangement transition pathway that needs
to be crossed to form a metastable structure in the transition, and
a larger value of F1 indicates more difficulties
in the reordering transition, only when ΔF >
0.1 × F1 do we think that the metastable
phase has long-term stability. When χN is small
and the lamella phase is metastable comparing with the disorder, represented
by the result of χN = 12, the single-chain
free energy barrier and the degree of segregation are low in {110}
lamellae rearrangement transition pathway, and the blocks including
rods and coils are largely intertwined to form tetragonally packed
cylinders, which is not a long-lived structure according to the above
standards for long-term stability, as shown in Figure 7d. When χN changes
from 13 to 15, the complex bicontinuous network structure SG appears
with long-term stability, whose single-chain free energy barrier F1, single-chain free energy difference ΔF, and long-term stability all increase with χN. We can see that ΔF is only 10–3kBT for
SG from Table 1, but
ΔF is the single-chain free energy difference
and the total energy difference of the system needs to multiply the
number of molecular chains. Therefore, this barrier is relatively
large, thus easily maintaining the metastable state experimentally.
The packing frustration of the system will increase with χN,33 and when χN exceeds 15, represented by the results of χN = 16,17, the extremely high interactions make the packing
frustration of SG exceed its critical value, resulting in F1 increasing sharply. At this moment, ΔF no longer exists, and tetragonally packed cylinders form
without long-term stability. According to the above discussions, the
mechanism of the reordering transition is suitable for a broad parameter
space, which is very beneficial for obtaining the desired complex
network structure experimentally.

Under the condition that this mechanism is suitable
for the most
of parameters, we change the system to the coil–coil block
copolymer to determine whether this mechanism is only applicable to
the rod–coil block copolymer. According to the thoroughly studied
phase diagram of the coil–coil block copolymers, we select
the reordering transition pathway of {110} lamellae with f = 0.5 and χN = 11 and f =
0.4 and χN = 15 near disorder–lamella
and cylinder–lamella transition boundaries, respectively. Also,
the rearrangement transitions of <111> cylinders with f = 0.3 and χN = 16 and f =
0.4 and χN = 12 near sphere–cylinder
and disorder–cylinder transition boundaries are drawn respectively.
The exact position of these parameters in the coil–coil phase
diagram33 is shown in Figure 8e. It can be seen from Figure 8 that SG appears
in the rearrangement transition pathway of {110} lamellae near the
disorder–lamella transition point and the tetragonally packed
cylinder appears near the cylinder–lamella transition point.
For the reordering transition pathways of <111> cylinders, the
metastable phases near the sphere–cylinder and the disorder–cylinder
transition boundary are BCC and PL, respectively. This is consistent
with our previous results regarding the rod–coil block copolymer
rearrangement transition and fully satisfied the conclusion that the
metastable phases existing in the reordering transition are related
to the epitaxial growth relationship and the selected parameter location
in the phase diagram. This discovery is quite exciting because it
breaks through the limit of the system and promotes the study on controlling
phase transition pathways to achieve the fabrication of target structures.

coil–coil system that has been studied before.33 The blue bold and hollow dots represent the parameter near
the cylinder–lamella phase transition point and the disorder–lamella
phase transition point, respectively. The red bold and hollow triangles
represent the parameter near the disorder–cylinder phase transition
point and the sphere–cylinder phase transition point, respectively.

For a better comparison with the rod–coil
system and a deeper
understanding of the mechanism of rearrangement transitions, we calculate
the changes of single-chain entropy  and the degree of contacting between segments  in four coil–coil reordering
transitions
mentioned above 9   10  

Similar to
the rod–coil block copolymer, when a complex
network phase appears in the rearrangement transition, the entropy
and the degree of segments mixing decrease, as shown in Figure 9. The entropy and the segments
mixing degree decrease in the reordering transitions with SG and PL
being encountered, which is related to the packing frustration required
by complex network structure formation. However, the segments contacting
degree also has a little drop in other two reordering transitions
pathways. This is because BCC and the cylinder still have a certain
degree of packing frustration in the coil–coil block copolymer,
which is alleviated by the orientation interaction of rods in the
rod–coil system. The coil–coil block copolymer is simple
with no orientation interaction μN and geometrical
asymmetry parameter β and only has the interface energy and
the entropy in the system to determine the final phase morphology.
When a complex network forms, the entropy stretching produced by packing
frustration makes the phase domain tends to be uniform in thickness,
and the interfacial energy acts to minimize the domain area, which
favors uniform interfacial curvature.33 The competition between the tendency for uniform curvature and uniform
domain thickness will result in final phase morphologies, and the
entropy stretching will cause the entropy loss in the coil–coil
system. From the above discussions, it is clear that the mechanism
of rearrangement transitions also has a well universality for coil–coil
block copolymers, and this provides hope for fabricating various target
structures by controlling the rearrangement transition in experiments.

each line is shown in the inset of (b).

Conclusions
We have studied on achieving constructing the target structure
via designing phase transition pathways and promoted the development
of the existing phase transition theory. The metastable phases appearing
in the rearrangement transition pathways are determined by the matching
degree of the dominant Fourier components, unit cell size, and selected
parameter location in the phase diagram. The metastable phase appearing
in the reordering transition pathway tends to form the structure at
the low χN side of the OOT boundary compared
with the initial phase. In particular, for complex network metastable
structures (SG, PL, etc.), it is necessary to select a rearrangement
transition between lamellae or cylinders near the ODT boundary with
the same epitaxial growth relationship but different orientations.
Combined with the phase diagram of the rod–coil system,epitaxial
growth relationship, and mechanism of reordering transitions, we can
completely achieve the fabrication of target phases by controlling
the rearrangement transition pathways. For instance, if we want to
get SG structures in experiments, we should design a reordering pathway
between {110} lamellae around the disorder–lamellae boundary.
According to our conclusions and the relevant phase diagram, we can
determine the parameters that can be easily obtained in practical
of the reordering pathway. Then, we can use solvent vapor annealing
and field methods83 to reorder {110} lamellae
in experiments to get SG.

We also analyze the free energy, entropy,
mixing degree between
different blocks, and orientation degree during the rearrangement
transitions of the rod–coil block copolymer and compare those
with the coil–coil block copolymer. It is found that the entropy
stretching caused by packing frustration of the complex network structures
during rearrangement transitions makes the entropy and the blocks
mixing degree decrease, which is advantageous for the parallel orientation
of rod blocks and beneficial to alleviate the packing frustration
from complex networks, so the rod–coil system has natural advantages
for constructing complex network structures.

Finally, we validate
that this rearrangement transition mechanism
can be applied to a wide range of χN, as well
as the coil–coil block copolymer. Thus, it is beneficial to
experimentally obtain target structures, improving guidance for the
synthesis of block copolymers and the preparation of self-assembly
structures. We hope that this study can contribute to the material
design of the rod–coil system experimentally via controlling
kinetic routes.
