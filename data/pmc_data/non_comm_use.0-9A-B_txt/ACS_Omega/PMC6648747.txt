Heavily doped nanocrystals of host
KLaF4 with rare earth
(RE3+ = Er3+, Tm3+, and Yb3+) ions prepared by a simple one-step template-free wet-chemical route
have been reported. Prepared KLaF4 nanocrystals reveal
phase-pure cubic structures (lattice constant a =
5.931Å) with space group Fm3m. Precisely defined molar ratios of heavily dopant RE3+ ions allow us to achieve wide color upconversion (UC) emission tunability
(blue, green to yellow–orange–red) and white light,
without any morphology and structure changes. The enhanced red emission
by a factor of ∼120 has been achieved in 20% Yb3+ and 5% Tm3+ ions in KLaF4:1% Er3+ nanocrystals, which is due to an efficient sensitizer–acceptor
(Yb3+ to Er3+ and Tm3+ ions) energy
transfer and interexchange energy process between acceptors. For the
first time, the key role of sensitizer (Yb3+) for UC emission
energy transfer to Er3+ and/or Tm3+ is experimentally
demonstrated. The evidence of upconversion photoluminescence excitation
spectra reveals a broad safe biological excitation window (690–1040
nm), which can be well demonstrated by low-cost NIR diode lasers/LEDs.
The applicability of these cubic nanophosphors is demonstrated as
light-emitting polymer composite coatings and blocks for LEDs and
solar cell panels. These well-dispersed UC nanocrystals can also be
found to have greater use in bioimaging and spectral studies.

1 Introduction
Lanthanide-doped fluoride systems are the most promising materials
for potential applications in photonics, bioimaging, and theranostics.1,2 They have high photochemical stability, high optical transparency
in the visible–NIR range, and low phonon energy. Incorporation
of appropriate rare earth ions into host lattices plays a great role
in achieving a specific crystallographic phase,3 tuning emission properties,4−8 and modifying magneto-optical properties.9,10 Upconversion
(UC) materials have the ability to convert NIR excitation into visible
emission, which can be promising luminescent probes for biological
tagging and imaging because NIR excitations have high penetration
depth into the cells, and do not show autofluorescence in the visible
region.11,12 Further, UC emission and structural content
improvements are explored in homogeneous and heterogeneous core–shell
type structures.13−20

Here, we introduce and manifest the viability of a new strategy
to attain multicolor emissions with enhanced UC luminescence in tridoped
KLaF4:Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ nanocrystals
on the basis of increased energy transfer in between doped lanthanides
using Yb3+ ions as sensitizer. Here, the effort is to visualize
different visible color productions in ultrasmall (down to 10 nm)
cubic fluoride nanocrystals with high UC efficiency under NIR excitation
(especially for biological window, 650–1350 nm) for labeling
and imaging of biomatters. In our practical approach, we use KLaF4:RE3+ nanocrystals to fabricate an optically transparent
light-emitting PMMA polymer composite that exhibits white light (containing
RGB emission) upon a single excitation at 980 nm.

2 Experimental
For the synthesis of KLaF4 nanocrystals,
a solution
of 0.476 g (1 mmol) of La(acac)3·xH2O was added dropwise to KF (0.2324 g, 4 mmol) solution
with continuous stirring for 4 h at a temperature of 60 °C. Typically,
the reagents were dissolved in 20 mL of methanol. On completing the
reaction, heating was stopped and the reaction solution was allowed
to cool to room temperature. Finally, white color solid was isolated
after several washings with methanol and centrifugation at 6000 rpm.
1 mol % Er(acac)3, 20 mol % Yb(acac)3, and (1–5)
mol % Tm(acac)3 were doped by dropwise addition of salt
solutions into the lanthanum ion solution.21 All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (99.9%) and used
without any further purification.

For the synthesis of PMMA
polymer-doped nanophosphors, doped KLaF4 nanocrystals (1
wt %) were dispersed in 10 mL acetone, added
to the methyl methacrylate monomer solution, and polymerized in the
presence of benzoyl peroxide initiator.22 The composite mixture was poured in a Petri dish after 1 h of polymerization
at a temperature of 60 °C and finally allowed to dry naturally
in a desiccator.

2.1 Characterization
PXRD data were recorded
using a Philips X’Pert Pro diffractometer with a point detector
in Bragg–Brentano geometry with a radius of 240 mm employing
a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54060 Å) and a power of
45 kV at 40 mA. Data points collected from 20 to 80° at 0.02°
step 2s/step after calibrating the instrument using
the Si external standard. The Rietveld refinement of PXRD data was
carried out using Fullprof software. The FESEM image was captured
using a FEI Quanta 200 F SEM. TEM micrographs were obtained using
a FEI TecnaiTF20 microscope equipped with a field emission gun source,
operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The sample was prepared
by dropping 1 μL of diluted nanoparticle suspension prepared
in ethanol on a carbon-coated grid and allowed to dry in air. UV–visible
diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda
1050 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer in a thin film prepared on a glass
substrate. The system was calibrated using the BaSO4 crystal
as reference. The Raman spectra of the samples were collected using
a Renishaw spectrophotometer equipped with a microscope operating
at a wavelength (λ) of 785 nm and a power of 5 mW. FTIR measurements
were performed on a Nicolet iS 50 FTIR spectrophotometer in transmission
mode. The UC and DC (down conversion, DC) emission measurements were
performed using a custom-built setup that consists of a 980 nm (3
W) and 405 nm (155 mW) diode lasers and a monochromator: Acton SP
2300 coupled to a photomultiplier tube (calibrated with mercury emission).
For time-resolved UC measurements, a mechanical chopper (12 Hz), a
lock-in amplifier, and a digital storage oscilloscope were additionally
employed in the setup. The changes in integrated intensity with respect
to excitation wavelength were obtained using a high-intensity femtosecond
laser (Spectra Physics, MaiTai, λ = 690–1040 nm, repetition
rate = 84 MHz, pulse duration = 120 fs).

3 Results
and Discussion
The undoped KLaF4 and x wt % Tm3+ (x = 0 to 5)-codoped KLaF4:1%
Er3+/20% Yb3+ nanocrystals were examined by
PXRD patterns at room temperature (Figure 1a). These nanocrystals are phase-pure cubic
unit cell with space group Fm3m of
KLaF4 (JCPDS file no. 75-2020). The diffraction peaks slightly
shift toward higher diffraction angles 2θ (∼1–2°)
as a function of RE3+ (Er, Yb, and Tm) ion doping concentration
that reflects a slight contraction of the unit cell volume, owing
to the substitution of larger ionic radius of La3+ ions
(1.06 Å in VIII coordination) by comparatively smaller ionic
radius RE3+ [Er3+ (0.89 Å), Tm3+ (0.87 Å), and Yb3+ (0.86 Å)] ions in a similar
coordination environment in the host lattice. Importantly, the relative
intensity increases, and broadening of (111) and (200) diffraction
peaks as a function of RE3+ dopant content indicates the
reduction of average crystallite size and provides strong evidence
of replacement doping of RE3+ ions in the KLaF4 host lattice. To shed more light on this, the microstrains (ε
or n) evaluated using the Williamson–Hall
expression together with other details, such as the average crystallite
size, are provided in the Supporting Information Table S1. The positive slopes (microstrain, n) observed for x wt % Tm3+ (x = 0 to 4)-doped
KLaF4:1% Er3+/20% Yb3+ nanocrystals
suggest tensile strain to be the major microstrain, whereas the negative
slope observed for KLaF4:1% Er3+/5% Tm3+/20% Yb3+ confirms the strain to be of compressive type
(Figure 1b). Microstrain,
which changes as a function of dopant concentration, supports distortions
within the local coordination environment.

plots. (c) Rietveld refinement of the cubic KLaF4 sample
(observed, calculated, and difference profiles as black, red, and

The PXRD pattern of cubic KLaF4 with
one type of high
symmetry cation site is refined by Rietveld refinement using the Fullprof
program on the basis of available structural data23,24 and respective internal standards of (Fm3m) CaF2 (Figure 1c). To avoid correlation with the background or other
parameters, all the thermal vibration parameters of the cubic phase
in refinement were kept unchanged. Here, K+ and La3+ ions are randomly filled
in the Ca2+ (4a) site, whereas the site
8c was filled by F– ions.23,24 The crystallographic refinement data and reliability factors showed
that the space group is Fm3m (#225),
with lattice constant [a] of 5.931 (±0.0016)
Å and GOF of 1.25 S. The crystal structure packing of the cubic
fluoride lattice is presented in the inset of Figure 1c.

The surface morphology, crystal
structure, and average crystallite
size of KLaF4:Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ (1:1:20 mol %) were further analyzed using FESEM and TEM techniques.
Agglomeration of crystallites was evident in the FESEM image (Figure 2b inset). However,
spherical morphology of crystallites with diameters falling in the
range of 2–10 nm could be resolved in the TEM image (Figure 2b). The average particle
size (6 nm) estimated from these measurements was consistent with
the size evaluated from the PXRD pattern (Figure 2b inset). The crystalline nature of these
nanocrystallites was evident in its high-resolution TEM image (Figure 2c). Lattice fringes
associated with the (111) lattice plane of the cubic KLaF4 structure could be located with a d-spacing of
0.33 nm. The inset of Figure 2c shows the SAED image indexed to the (111), (200), and (220)
planes of the cubic fluoride structure.

optical band gap estimation from the Kubelka–Munk function
of undoped and doped (Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+) KLaF4.

The diffused reflectance spectrum (Figure 2d) has a strong band edge at about 300 nm.
For the doped samples, the transitions were observed at 377 (4I15/2 → 4G11/2), 521
(4I15/2 → 2H11/2), 547 (4I15/2 → 4S3/2), and 651 nm (4I15/2 → 4F9/2) for Er3+ ions; 680 (3F3 → 3F2) and 800 nm (3H6 → 3H4) for Tm3+ ions; and 997 nm (2F7/2 → 2F5/2, 4I15/2 → 4I11/2) for Yb3+ and Er3+ ions. The
optical band gap (Eg) was calculated using
the Kubelka–Munk function, and the Tauc relationship was used
to estimate direct Eg (Figure 2e). The deviation in the single
slope is due to the fundamental and residual absorptions, involving
the impurities present in the samples.25,26 The Eg shifted slightly as a function of lanthanide
content. This could be due to the introduction of localized impurity
states, owing to rare earth ion doping.

The observed phonon
bands from Raman spectra (Figure 3) for undoped and doped samples
were centered at 127, 161, 292, 357, and 410 cm–1 and at 138, 161, 317, 490, 584, and 647 cm–1,
respectively.27,28 The effective phonon energies
calculated from the equation  (where Ei, wi, and Ai represent
the position, FWHM, and relative intensity of each Lorentzian sub-band)
for undoped and doped 1% Er3+/x% Tm3+/20% Yb3+ (x = 0–5) KLaF4 host lattices are given in the Supporting Information Table S2. The effective phonon energy that defines
the rate of nonradiative transition appears to enhance with increasing
Tm3+ content. It is higher than the reported value for
hexagonal KLaF4 (262 cm–1) but comparable
to the widely studied NaYF4 system (∼360 cm–1).27,29 It is a fact that low phonon
energy systems minimize nonradiative (multiphoton) transition and
increase the overall metastable energy lifetime in the emission mechanism.

Raman spectra of undoped and doped KLaF4:Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ at different
concentrations. (b) and (c) are the spectra for undoped and doped
(1:5:20 mol %) along with multipeak Lorentzian fittings (see the Supplementary Information).

By adjusting the concentration of codoped Er3+, Yb3+, and Tm3+ ions in the host lattice,
a wide spectrum
of colors (NIR, red, green, and blue) can be achieved, which is practically
useful in white light production and biological applications. For
this purpose, a series of KLaF4 nanocrystals doped with
1% Er3+/x% Tm3+/20% Yb3+ (x = 1–5%) were prepared. The UC
emission capability and a wide range of visible color tunability of
KLaF4 nanoparticles doped by rational concentrations of
Er3+, Tm3+, and Yb3+ ions by illuminating
with infrared excitation (980 nm, CW) have been demonstrated in Figure 4a,b. These high concentrations
of sensitizer Yb3+ and additional Tm3+ do not
affect the cubic KLaF4 crystalline phase and particle size
but remarkably tune the emission color from green to white (Figure 4b). The UC spectrum
of KLaF4:1% Er3+ has three characteristic visible
emission bands at 521, 545, and 654 nm. The UC is further amplified
by additional 20 mol % Yb3+ ion as sensitizer, showing
a weak quartet assigned to the transitions of green (545 nm) and red
(654 nm): transitions 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, respectively. On
the other hand, the typical UC emission spectrum of 1% Tm3+/20% Yb3+-doped KLaF4 has characteristic blue-dominated
emission bands at 451 and 472 nm (Figure 4a). Other UC emission red-end transitions
are 651, 700, and 800 nm are obviously not visible to the naked eye.

PL spectra (400–850 nm) and (b) the corresponding
camera images as seen by the naked eye (excited with a 980 nm CW laser,
power ∼150 mW). (c) DC PL spectra (1450–1550 nm) of

figure. (e) CIE (x, y) coordinate
diagram for UC spectra in (a).

Therefore, the green–orange Er3+/Yb3+ and blue-dominated Tm3+/Yb3+ UC emissions
can be expected to result into white light UC emission in tridoped
KLaF4:Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ nanocrystals. Figure 4 gives a systematic
variation of Tm3+ addition (from 0 to 5 wt %) in KLaF4:(1 wt % Er3+ and 20 wt % Yb3+) phosphors.
The emission colors that appeared to the naked eye can also be visualized
from the CIE chromaticity coordinates (x, y), as given in Figure 4e. It is interesting to note that the calculated chromaticity
coordinates (x = 0.334, y = 0.333)
and (x = 0.335, y = 0.334) for 1
and 2 mol % Tm3+ ions doped in KLaF4:1% Er3+/20% Yb3+ nanocrystals are very close to the standard
equal energy white light illuminate (x = 0.333, y = 0.333).

The energy transfer UC mechanisms involved
in the compositionally
tunable emission colors in codoped Er3+, Tm3+, and Yb3+ ion nanophosphors are presented in Figure 5. Several concurrent
electron transport and relaxation mechanisms are involved in the appearance
of white light. They are as follows: (i) The UC mechanism in Er3+-doped KLaF4 mainly occurs via ground state absorption
(GSA) (4I15/2 + pumped photon → 4I11/2) and excited state absorption (ESA) (4I11/2 → 4F7/2) processes
(Figure 5). The multiphonon
radiation populates the 2H11/2, 4S3/2, and 4F9/2 levels. Finally,
radiative transitions 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (521 nm), 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (545 nm), and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (654 nm) occur in green and
red regions. (ii) In 20% Yb3+/1% Er3+-codoped
phosphors, red emission (654 nm) is higher by a factor of ∼15
than that in single-doped Er3+ phosphor, confirming that
the UC mechanism in the codoped Er3+ → Yb3+ phosphor is enhanced by two-step energy transfer (ET) from the excited
state of Yb3+ → Er3+ and little contribution
from the GSA/ESA process within Er3+ ions. Initially, Yb3+ ions are excited from the ground 2F7/2 to excited 2F5/2 level and transfer their
energy to the 4I11/2 level of Er3+ ions (Figure 5).
Within the lifetime of the 4I11/2 level, a second
Yb3+ ion transfers its energy again to Er3+,
thus the excessive population in the 4F7/2 level.
Eventually, the 2H11/2/4S3/2 and 4F9/2 are populated by nonradiative transition
and give rise to green and red radiative deactivations. Because of
the decrease of the interatomic distance between Yb3+ and
Er3+ ions in the heavily doped Yb3+ sensitizer,
it causes two back energy transfers: (a) 4S3/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) → 4I13/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) and (b) 4F7/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) → 4I11/2 (Er3+)
+ 2F5/2 (Yb3+). The transition (a)
represents depopulation in excited levels 2H11/2/4S3/2 that results in quenching of green light
emission. At the same time, the 4I13/2 (Er3+) excited level is saturated, and energy is transferred from
the excited 2F5/2 (Yb3+) level to
Er3+ via the energy transfer process 4I13/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) → 4F9/2 (Er3+)
+ 2F7/2 (Yb3+), which directly enhances
the population in the red-emitting level 4F9/2. (iii) The UC process in 20% Yb3+/1% Tm3+-codoped
phosphors is entirely due to the energy transfer from Yb3+ to Tm3+ ions because there is no GSA/ESA in Tm3+ ions that matches NIR photon energy. A stepwise sequential ET process
is responsible to populate 1G4/1D2 states in the Tm3+ ions. First, the 2F5/2 level of Yb3+ ions is populated by absorbing
pump photons. This energy is transferred to the 3H5 state in Tm3+ ions with eventual nonradiative
transition from the 3H5 to 3F4 level. In the second step, 3F3 and 3F2 levels populate by ET from Yb3+ to
Tm3+. These levels depopulated nonradiatively to the 3H4 state. Finally, in the third energy transfer,
the 1G4 state is populated and then strong blue
(1G4 → 3H6) and
weak orange–red (1G4 → 3F4,3F3,2 → 3H6) emissions take place. Further, the 1D2 state is populated by another Yb3+ ion transfer from
the 1G4 level, which gives rise to 1D2 → 3F4 transition. Therefore,
the complete relaxation has been followed in the four-step sequential
ET process (Figure 5a).

Figure 5 (a) Schematic energy level diagram of Er3+, Tm3+, and Yb3+ ions and various energy transfer UC mechanisms
involved among codoped ions. (b) Symbolic representation of Coulombic
and spin–orbit interactions and inter- and intra-energy transfers
within the RE3+ ions, resulting into white color UC emission.

It is thus sensible to predict
that the UC mechanism in the complex
tridoped sample is mainly due to the energy transfer from Yb3+ sensitizer (having larger absorption cross section at 980 nm excitation
window) to Tm3+ and Er3+ ions. Further, the
energy transfer from Er3+ to Tm3+ ions can also
occur because of the decrease in average distance between Er3+ and Tm3+ ions with the increase of Tm3+ ion
concentration.30 As a consequence of such
energy transfer between Er3+ and Tm3+, green
emission is quenched and red emission is enhanced with the increase
of Tm3+ dopant. The same is clearly reflected in the integrated
intensity ratios of red/green, red/blue, and green/blue for visible
and NIR region bands illustrated in Figure 4d. The trend of the intensity ratios of red
to green and red to blue UC emissions is a supporting evidence for
effective energy transfer from Er3+ to Tm3+ ions.
Furthermore, the red/green ratio saturated after 3 mol % Tm3+ content. According to the previous work by Lin and co-workers, the
most likely cross-relaxation mechanism between Er3+ and
Tm3+ in the tridoped system occurs through 1G4 (Tm3+) + 4I15/2 (Er3+) → 3F4 (Tm3+) + 4F9/2 (Er3+) transition because of a
small energy difference between Tm3+:1G4 → 3F4 (15530 cm–1) and Er3+:4I15/2 → 4F9/2 (15240 cm–1). This energy
transfer was confirmed by shortening of the lifetime of 1G4 state in Tm3+/Yb3+ and Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ systems.31 In our experiments, when 1 mol % Er3+ content
is incorporated into the KLaF4:1% Tm3+/20% Yb3+ sample, the lifetime of 1G4 state
(Figure S2) does not change significantly,
suggesting that the energy transfer from Er3+ to Tm3+ ions does not occur through higher states of Tm3+ (1G4,1D2) ions, but
the favorable energy transfer process could be 3F4 (Tm3+) + 4I11/2 (Er3+) → 3H6 (Tm3+) + 4F9/2 (Er3+). Finally, the effective energy
transfer between Er3+ and Tm3+ that leads to
an increase in red emission could be 4S3/2 (Er3+):4I9/2 (Er3+):4I11/2 (Er3+):3F4 (Tm3+):4F9/2 (Er3+).32 The conventional DC spectra in the NIR region
of doped KLaF4:Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ phosphors excited with a 980 nm CW laser is presented in Figure 4c. The emission bands
centered at 1468 and 1535 nm correspond to the intra-4f electronic
transitions, 3H4 → 3F4 (Tm3+) and 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 (Er3+). The relative emission
intensities of visible (UC) and NIR (DC) regions cannot be compared
because the detection systems are different.

We further studied
the power dependence of upconverted luminescence
to have an understanding of the nonlinear pumping UC energy transfer
processes. The UC emission intensity (I) measured
as a function of laser power (P) is given by the
expression I ∝ Pn, where n represents the number of pump photons
absorbed per emitted upconverted photon.33,34 The log–log plot of emission intensity (I) versus excitation power (P) yields a straight
line with slope n and reveals the nature of UC (Figure 6a–c, Figure S4, and Table S1).

Er3+/1% Tm3+/20% Yb3+-doped KLaF4 samples excited with 980 nm CW diode laser.
The light yellow shaded region represents the emission saturation
region.

It can be predicted from the results
that, at low power regions,
UC is promoted via a two-photon process in the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped system and three-step sequential ET processes are
involved in the Tm3+/Yb3+-codoped system. Meanwhile,
in the tridoped Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ host
lattice, UC is via both two- and three-ET processes (Figure 5a). It is believed that saturation
of intermediate 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 states via an efficient ET and EBT process [for example, 4S3/2 (Er3+) + 3H6 (Tm3+) → 3F4 (Tm3+) + 4I9/2 (Er3+)] that occurs depopulates
the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 states
and leads to reduction in the slope (n = 1.24) of
green emission. Moreover, at high pump power regions, a significant
decrease in slope (Table S1) is observed
because of the increased competition between linear decay and UC for
the depletion of the intermediate excited states (saturation effect)
and/or excessive heating of the host lattice.

Another interesting
result is identifying the upconversion photoluminescence
excitation (UC-PLE) spectral region, similar to that of conventional
PLE spectra. The conventional PLE closely resembles the absorption
transitions as potential excitation sources. In a nonlinear excitation
mechanism, the UC emission is dominated by several cross-relaxation
mechanisms as explained in the previous sections. The UC-PLE spectral
region has been identified by excitation at various IR excitation
wavelengths between 690 and 1040 nm, utilizing a femtosecond laser
having a repetition rate of 84 MHz and a pulse duration of 120 fs.
Such studies will give insight into the origin of excitation and confirmation
of UC and other cross-relaxations proposed in the previous sections.
The UC spectra recorded at various NIR excitations (690–1040
nm) for all the studied phosphors are given in Figure S5, which are consistent with the UC spectra excited
at 980 nm CW laser (Figure 4a). The intensities of UC emission spectral lines of respective
compositions are plotted in Figure 7. The UC spectral intensities are normalized with respect
to the excitation laser power. As observed, the UC-PLE spectra resemble
similar spectra features of absorption transition of the Yb3+ ion (2F7/2 to 2F5/2)
(the diffused reflection spectrum is compared with UC-PLE in Figure S6). It is known that the Yb3+ sensitizer transitions are affected by the crystal field around
the ions and produce Stark effect related splitting in both the energy
levels.35,36 Thus, the manifolds of Stark effect derived
transition of 2F7/2 to 2F5/2 are around 920, 940, 980, and 1000 nm. Thus, the UC-PLE spectral
investigations experimentally confirm the role of Yb3+ as
a sensitizer and also confirm the relaxation mechanisms proposed in
the previous sections. Furthermore, having the availability of a wide
range of diode lasers in the range of 900–1000 nm, the selected
choice of excitations for observing UC spectra and/or imaging will
have a greater advantage. By further probing, the integrated intensity
of the peak at 920 nm is significantly enhanced as a function of Tm3+ concentration with respect to the peak at 980 nm in the
composition of (a) 1% Er3+/20% Yb3+, (b) 1%
Tm3+/20 %Yb3+, (c) 1% Er3+/1% Tm3+/20% Yb3+, and (d) 1% Er3+/2% Tm3+/20 %Yb3+.

therapeutic window because the biological tissues will have larger
penetration depth in this spectral region. Therefore, this study further
helps to choose the IR excitation source, particularly for photodynamic
therapy, imaging, and/or spectral probing the inner tissues.

Apart from the biological applications, these UC nanoparticles
can readily be incorporated into optically transparent polymer PMMA
to utilize in different potential applications, such as the improvement
of efficiency of solar cells, 3D displays, and other optoelectronic
devices. Here, we have demonstrated the incorporation of UC nanoparticles
into a well-known polymer, PMMA. The uniformly dispersed UC nanoparticles
doped PMMA blocks and thin film results are shown in Figure 8. The UC spectrum obtained
by excitation at 980 nm is similar to that of dispersed UC nanoparticles
(Figure 4a). Such robust
UC polymers can be readily integrated onto commercial solar cells
for improved efficiency. These polymers can also replace the polymer
capping of IR-LEDs to obtain white-light LEDs

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated
the successful preparation
of biocompatible, phase-pure, and strong UC emitting KLaF4:1% Er3+/20% Yb3+ nanocrystals with a systematic
codoping of Tm3+ ions. The focus is mainly to demonstrate
the UC visible emission efficiency (pumping in the IR energies) and
to achieve a wide range of color tunability, from blue to white light,
which can be precisely controlled by the Tm3+-codoping
concentrations. These heavily doped nanocrystals showed clear phase
purity with cubic crystallinity even up to 5% Tm3+ concentrations.
Meanwhile, by pumping at 980 nm, these nanocrystals showed remarkable
color tunability from green to white. The visible UC emission intensities
substantially enhanced up to a factor of ∼120, as a result
of energy transfer from sensitizer Yb3+ ions to acceptors
(Er3+ and Tm3+ ions) as well as the interexchange
energy process between the acceptors. The role of sensitizer and interion
energy crossover on visible UC emission has been successfully demonstrated
by excitation in the wide range of IR biological window wavelengths
(690–1040 nm). This has consistently been visualized for all
the UC emission (green to white light) Tm3+-codoped systems,
which is the first experimental evidence for the role of sensitizer
and interion energy crossover. The UC-PLE spectra obtained demonstrate
a broad UC excitation window, which can be well utilized in commercially
available low-cost IR diode lasers/LEDs for low-cost spectral/imaging
applications. These water dispersible cubic fluoride nanophosphors
has been dispersed and polymerized with the monomers of methyl methacrylate
(MMA), to obtain the nanophosphor-doped PMMA composites. The applicability
of these highly UC-emitting nanophosphor PMMA thin film and polymer
blocks is demonstrated as light-emitting polymer composite coatings
and blocks for 3D displays, LEDs, and solar cell panels.37 The studies can also be extended to use these
UC nanophosphors for biological tagging of cancer cells such as Huh7,
bioimaging, and spectral studies.38
