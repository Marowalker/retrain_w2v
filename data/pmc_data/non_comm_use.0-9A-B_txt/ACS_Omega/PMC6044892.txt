β-Xylosides
have been used as an artificial initiator of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
biosynthesis
to investigate its mechanism and to obtain these oligosaccharides.
In GAG biosynthesis, phosphorylation on the xylose residue is a crucial
step. However, little attention has been paid to phosphorylated oligosaccharides
obtained from β-xylosides. In a previous study, we demonstrated
that a novel β-xyloside, N-lauryl-O-β-xyloyranosyl-serinamide (Xyl-Ser-C12), had excellent GAG-type
oligosaccharide priming ability, whereas phosphorylated oligosaccharides
were not found in the primed oligosaccharides. This study examines
the potential of Xyl-Ser-C12 and three of its derivatives for use
as a probe to investigate the GAG biosynthesis mechanism. Glycosylated
products were obtained by incubation of the β-xylosides in normal
human dermal fibroblast cells and compared by liquid chromatography–electrospray
ionization-mass spectrometry. By the optimized method to detect phosphorylated
products, Xyl-Ser-C12 was demonstrated to prime not only GAG-type
oligosaccharides but also a variety of xylose-phosphorylated products.
Among the synthesized β-xylosides, those consisting of xylosyl-serine
primed large amounts of phosphorylated and GAG-type oligosaccharides,
whereas the others primed sialyloligosaccharides mainly. The majority
of the phosphorylated products were considered to be GAG intermediates,
which are less observed in nature. To our best knowledge, this is
the first report showing that the amino acid residues around the Xyl
attachment position strongly affect the phosphorylation efficiency
and GAG chain-priming ability of β-xylosides. This study leads
to the possibility of the use of β-xyloside as a probe to observe
the Xyl phosphorylation process during GAG biosynthesis and investigate
comparative glycosaminoglycomics between different cells.

==== Body
Introduction
Glycosaminoglycans
(GAGs), linear anionic polysaccharides, are
mainly found in the extracellular matrix and play a key role in several
biological events, such as cell–cell interaction, signal transduction,
cancer progression, tumor migration, and anticoagulation.1 GAGs comprise alternating disaccharide units
(hexuronic acid and hexosamine) and are classified by the disaccharide
unit structure. Chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), and
heparan sulfate (HS) are sulfated GAGs, which are sulfated in various
positions, including the hydroxyl groups or amino groups. These GAGs
exist as a side chain of proteoglycans (PGs) and are highly heterogeneous
due to their chain lengths, sulfated degrees, and sulfated positions.
This heterogeneity is attracting much interest because it makes it
possible for GAGs to interact with various biological molecules, such
as proteins.2

CS, DS, and HS are
attached to a hydroxyl group on the serine residues
in core proteins of PGs via a linkage tetrasaccharide (GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-).3 Biosynthesis of the tetrasaccharide is initiated
with xylosylation to the hydroxyl group on Ser in the core protein,
followed by two galactosylations, after which the synthesis of the
tetrasaccharide is accomplished by the addition of GlcA on the nonreducing
end, Gal.4 The disaccharide units of CS,
DS, and HS are elongated on the GlcA of the tetrasaccharide.

In GAG biosynthesis, phosphorylation on the Xyl is a key modification.3,5 The phosphorylation on the Xyl occurs transiently and is finally
removed during construction of the linkage tetrasaccharide. It has
recently been shown that this transient phosphorylation regulates
the number and chain length of GAG elongated on the tetrasaccharide.6 However, it is difficult to observe the phosphorylated
intermediate synthesized in cells because the phosphate group on the
Xyl is mostly removed in mature GAG chains.7 The issue is even more complicated because the PGs in which tetrasaccharides
are attached have structural varieties in their sequences. Thus, a
simple and concise method to observe the linkage tetrasaccharides
and their intermediates is needed for the investigation of the GAG
biosynthesis mechanism.

β-Xylosides have been used to
obtain GAG-type glycans due
to their priming abilities of GAG oligosaccharides. For example, Okayama
et al. first showed that p-nitrophenyl-β-xylopyranoside
(Xyl-pNP) can prime GAG-type oligosaccharides when added to a chick
cartilage cell culture.8 4-Methylumbelliphenyl-β-xylopyranoside,9 β-estradiol-xylopyranoside,10 naphthol xylopyranosides,11−14C-xylopyranosides,15,16 and “click” xylopyranosides17−20 have also been applied for the
elongation of GAG oligosaccharides. These β-xylosides have been
used not only as a saccharide primer to obtain the GAG-type oligosaccharides
but also as a chemical tool to explore species of glycans potentially
produced by cells and colocation of glycosyltransferases on the endoplasmic
reticulum and golgi apparatus.21 However,
in most of these studies, the major focus was on the amount, molecular
weight, and GAG types of primed oligosaccharides, whereas not much
attention was paid to the intermediates of oligosaccharides primed
on the β-xylosides.

In a previous study, it was demonstrated
that N-lauryl-O-β-xyloyranosyl-serinamide
(Xyl-Ser-C12),
which was designed to resemble the attachment site of PG, showed excellent
GAG-type oligosaccharide priming ability, including some intermediates
of the linkage tetrasaccharides.22 The
results imply that the amino acid residue in β-xylosides strongly
affects their priming ability. Moreover, it is possible that a suitable
β-xyloside that primes Xyl-phosphorylated oligosaccharides can
be used as a chemical probe for the investigation of GAG biosynthesis.
However, the relationship between the structure of the amino acids
and the priming ability has not been examined, and phosphorylated
oligosaccharides have not been found in the glycosylated products.

The aim of this study is to explore the potential of Xyl-Ser-C12
and its derivatives as a chemical probe for investigating the GAG
biosynthesis mechanism. N-Lauryl-O-β-xyloyranosyl-threonamide (Xyl-Thr-C12) was chosen as a counterpart
of Xyl-Ser-C12 because threonine is another β-hydroxy amino
acid, which is glycosylated by O-glycans but not
by GAG. N-Lauryl-O-β-xyloyranosyl-serinyl-glycinamide
(Gly-(Xyl)Ser-C12) and N-lauryl-O-β-xyloyranosyl-threonyl-glycinamide (Gly-(Xyl)Thr-C12) were
chosen because of the effect of the Gly residue that is franked with
the Ser residue in the PG consensus sequence. The four types of β-xylosides
that have amino acid residues as aglycones were synthesized, and their
priming ability was examined using the normal human dermal fibroblast
(NHDF). The analytical procedure for priming oligosaccharides was
optimized to detect phosphorylated products efficiently. The structure
of the glycosylated products was deduced by tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) results and enzymatic digestion. The priming abilities of
the β-xylosides were compared, and the relationship between
the structure of the aglycones and the priming ability is discussed.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of Xyl-Ser-C12 (1) and Its Derivatives
(2–4)
The synthesis scheme of Xyl-Ser-C12
(1) and its derivatives
is shown in Figure 1. In a previous study, Xyl-Ser-C12 was chemically synthesized from
2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-d-xylopyranosyl-trichloroacetimidate
as a glycosyl donor. However, this chemical synthesis required multiple
steps to control both the reaction sites and anomeric selectivity
of xylose, necessitating large amounts of reagents and organic solvent.
To avoid this problem, we chose chemoenzymatic condensation using
a glycosidase to synthesize β-xylosylated amino acids. In chemoenzymatic
condensation, high selectivity of reaction sites and anomeric configuration
can be achieved because of the stereoselectivity of glycosidases used
for synthesis.23−32 In this study, we chose xylo-oligosaccharides as the glycosyl donors, N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-serine (Boc-Ser-OH)
or N-Boc-threonine (Boc-Thr-OH) as acceptors, and
commercially available β1-4 xylanase from Trichoderma
longibrachiatum. The chemoenzymatic condensations
were carried out at 40 °C, pH 5.0, for 4 days to obtain monoxylosylated
amino acids (5 and 8). In 1H
NMR spectra of the monoxylosylated amino acids, the peaks of the anomeric
protons appeared at around 4.4 ppm, and the coupling constants were
8 Hz (Figures S1 and S2), confirming that
the purified products had the β-anomer configuration. The yields
of the chemoenzymatic condensations were 11.1% for N-Boc-O-(β-xylopyranosyl)-l-serine
(5) or 12.5% for N-Boc-O-(β-xylopyranosyl)-l-threonine (8). These
results were reasonable, and the chemoenzymatic reactions using β1-4
xylanase were properly proceeded because Nilsson et al. reported that
yields of Boc-Ser glycosides were 4–14% and Boc-Thr glycosides
were 4–8% using β-mannosidase and β-galactosidase
as catalysts.32

Figure 1 Chemoenzymatic synthesis
of Xyl-Ser-C12 and its derivatives. Reagents
and conditions: (a) xylo-oligosaccharides, β1-4 xylanase, acetate
buffer pH 5.0, 40 °C; (b) ammonium salt (HOBt-NH3),
1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI),
acetonitrile (MeCN), room temperature (r.t.); (c) 4 mol/L HCl in dioxane,
r.t.; (d) 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium
chloride (DMT-MM), N-methylmorpholine (NMM), lauric
acid, EtOH/H2O (2/3), r.t.; (e) Gly-NH2, DMT-MM,
NMM, MeCN, r.t.; (f) trifluoroacetyl, r.t.; (g) DMT-MM, NMM, lauric
acid, H2O, 40 °C.

Conversion of 5 and 8 into the
final
products (1–4) was carried out in accordance with
the N-Boc chemistry for peptide synthesis. For conversion
of carboxyl groups into amides, the reactions were carried out with
1-hydroxy-1H-benzotriazole, HOBt-NH3,
and EDCI.33 Condensation of 5 or 8 with glycinamide was carried out using DMT-MM.
Condensation with lauric acid was carried out in a two-step synthesis
involving removal of the N-Boc group with acid and
condensation using DMT-MM. The overall yields of the final products
were 4.10% for Xyl-Ser-C12, 4.91% for Xyl-Thr-C12, 5.66% for Gly-(Xyl)Ser-C12,
and 5.06% for Gly-(Xyl)Thr-C12. Compared to the results of the previous
report, the number of synthesis steps was reduced from 10 to 3.

The Xyl-Ser-C12 synthesized in this study showed negative specific
rotation. This was inconsistent with the previous report.22 In the report, deacetylation was carried out
with sodium methoxide, and this strong base treatment might have caused
racemization of the l-serine residue. Taking these facts
into consideration, Xyl-Ser-C12 synthesized in the previous study
might have been racemized. In this study, Xyl-Ser-C12 and other β-xylosides
showed negative specific rotation; hence, the racemization did not
occur during the syntheses of these β-xylosides. In addition,
some of the literature has reported that d-xylosyl-l-serine and its derivatives have negative specific rotation.34,35 Consequently, we consider that the Xyl-Ser-C12 synthesized in this
study has a d-xylosyl-l-serine structure, and the
synthetic scheme using chemoenzymatic condensation is less laborious
and more stereoselective.

Method Optimization and Structure Analysis
of Phosphorylated
Products
As mentioned in the Introduction section, phosphorylation on the Xyl residue in the linkage tetrasaccharides
is an important step in GAG biosynthesis. However, phosphorylated
GAGs are rarely found in nature, and only phosphorylated products
of β-xylosides have been reported.36,37 The reasons given for this include poor recovery of the phosphorylated
products from the cell culture,4,38−40 incomparability of the analytical apparatus and conditions for the
phosphorylated products, and difficulty in distinguishing the phosphorylated
and sulfated products. Hence, in this study, we optimized the protocol
for extraction, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)
conditions, and applied high-resolution mass spectrometry.

In
the LC–MS analysis, it is well-known that phosphorylated compounds
are easily absorbed on the titanium and the stainless steel used in
the LC system, and this absorption causes poor peak shapes of the
phosphorylated compounds.41 When the glycosylated
products were analyzed under conventional conditions, the phosphorylated
products gave extremely broad peaks or were not detected at all (Figure 2A). To avoid this
absorption, we chose to flush the LC system with H3PO4 solution before every analysis. By flushing the LC–MS
system with 20 mM H3PO4 in 50% MeCN before every
analysis, the peak shapes of the phosphorylated products were improved
dramatically without changing the retention time, peak shape, or sensitivity
to other glycosylated products (Figure 2B).

Figure 2 Flushing with phosphoric acid before the analysis can
improve the
peak shapes of the phosphorylated products. (A) EICs of the glycosylated
products before phosphorylated acid wash. (B) EICs of the phosphorylated
products after phosphoric acid wash.

The glycosylated products obtained from the NHDF cell culture
were
prepared and analyzed by the optimized method. Table 1 shows the structure, m/z value, ion type, retention time, proportions, and fragment
ions of the MS/MS spectrum of the detected glycosylated product. The
structures of the glycosylated products were deduced from the MS/MS
spectra and the results of enzymatic digestion. In particular, phosphorylated
and sulfated products were determined by accurate m/z values and observation of m/z 78.9585 ([PO3]−) in the MS/MS
spectra. Twenty-nine glycosylated products were detected from 1.5
mL of the NHDF cell culture, of which 11 were considered to be phosphorylated
products.

a Proportions
were calculated from
the peak areas of the glycosylated products.

Figure 3 shows the
structural analysis of the disaccharide (m/z 659.2798) as an example. In the MS/MS spectrum (Figure 3A), [PO3]− (m/z 78.9601)
was clearly observed and hence the disaccharide was considered to
be phosphorylated.42 In addition, m/z 497.2288 (Y1), 391.0667
(C2), and 373.0561 (B1) meant glycoside bond
cleavage ions, suggesting that the phosphorylation occurred on the
Xyl. However, in the phosphorylated product, peaks at m/z 241.0112 and 259.0222 were also clearly observed
(shown by arrows in Figure 3A). These ions implied the existence of a phosphorylated hexose
residue in the products, a phenomenon inconsistent with the existence
of the phosphorylated Xyl residue. To clarify this point, the glycosylated
products were digested by β-galactosidase, followed by the LC–MS/MS
analysis. Figure 3B
shows the extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of m/z 659.2798 and 497.2270 (Xyl(P)-Ser-C12) before
and after β-galactosidase digestion, respectively. The peak
height at 11.5 min on the EIC of m/z 659.2798 (Hex-Xyl(P)-Ser-C12) decreased considerably after digestion,
whereas that at 5.7 min on the EIC of m/z 497.2270 (Xyl(P)-Ser-C12) largely increased after digestion. On
the basis of these results, the major component of the phosphorylated
disaccharide (m/z 659.2798) was
deduced to be Galβ-Xyl(P)-Ser-C12. The fragment ions m/z 241.0112 and 259.0222 in the MS/MS
may have been detected due to migration of the phosphate group during
MS/MS excitation43 or coelution of Gal(P)β-Xyl-Ser-C12.

ions is described in the figure. Arrows indicate m/z 241.0112 and 259.0222. (B) Comparison of EIC
profiles before and after β-galactosidase digestion. The ranges
of the vertical axis are set equal.

As in the case of the phosphorylated disaccharide, other
glycosylated
products that gave [PO3]− ions in their
MS/MS spectra were considered to be phosphorylated products. These
phosphorylated products were deduced to be phosphorylated on the Xyl
residue because Y1 (m/z 497.23) or Y2 (m/z 659.28)
ions were observed in their MS/MS spectra (Table 1). Thus, the phosphorylated products were
concluded to be intermediates of the linkage tetrasaccharide and GAG
oligosaccharides. The major reason why the phosphorylated products
were not detected in previous studies is probably due to the absorption
of these products. This result demonstrates the feasibility of Xyl-Ser-C12
for use as a chemical probe to investigate the GAG biosynthesis mechanism.

Interestingly, not only Xyl-phosphorylated di-, tri-, and tetra-oligosaccharides
but longer phosphorylated pentasaccharides (m/z 599.7184 and 701.2581) and a heptasaccharide (m/z 789.2741) were also detected. The phosphorylated
pentasaccharide (m/z 599.7184) could
be partly digested by heparitinases (Figure 4A); the major structure of the phosphorylated
pentasaccharide was deduced to be GlcNAcα1-4HexA-Hex-Hex-Xyl(P)-Ser-C12.
In contrast, the phosphorylated heptasaccharide (m/z 789.2741) could be digested by chondroitinase
ABC (C-ABC) and chondroitinase ACII (C-ACII) but was not digested
by heparitinases (Figure 4B). Therefore, the structure of the heptasaccharide would
be GalNAcβ1-4GlcAβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4GlcA-Hex-Hex-Xyl(P)-Ser-C12.
Izumikawa et al. demonstrated the phosphorylated linkage oligosaccharides
to be an intermediate of the immature GAG chain resulting from an
imbalance of GAG xylosylkinase-named family with sequence similarity
20, member B (FAM20B), xylose phosphatase, and chondroitin N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-1.6 Their results indicate that the phosphorylation on Xyl residues
may be a discrimination tag to sort the linkage oligosaccharides into
GAG chain elongation or termination and that these enzymes work in
harmony to regulate the number, length, and amount of GAG chains elongated
on PGs. In this study, both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated oligosaccharides
that have a linkage tetrasaccharide structure were detected. Thus,
the ratio of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated oligosaccharides
probably represents the capability of GAG biosynthesis of the examined
cells.

Structural Analysis of
the Glycosylated Products by GAG Lyase
Digestion
To determine the GAG types of the elongated oligosaccharides,
the glycosylated products were digested by GAG lyases, followed by
the LC–MS/MS analysis. Figure 5 shows the structural analysis of heptasaccharides
(m/z 749.2910). In the chromatograms
(Figure 5A), the untreated
sample gave a minor peak at 24.49 min and a major peak at 25.97 min.
After digestion with C-ABC/C-ACII, the major peak completely disappeared,
whereas the minor peak remained intact. In contrast, the minor peak
completely disappeared by heparitinase digestion, whereas the entire
major peak remained. In addition, the cross-ring cleavage ion, 2,5A3 (m/z 480.1401),
was observed in the MS/MS spectra of m/z 749.2910 at the minor peak (Figure 5B), indicating the existence of the -HexA1-4HexNAc-
structure in the sequence. The cross-ring cleavage ion was not observed
in the spectra at the major peak (Figure 5C). Other oligosaccharides composed of repeating
disaccharide units were digested by C-ABC/C-ACII but not by heparitinase
(Figures 4B and S3). Therefore, the heptasaccharide at the minor
peak was considered to be an HS-type oligosaccharide and that at the
major peak a CS-type oligosaccharide.

Structural Analysis of
Sialyloligosaccharides
Besides
GAG-type oligosaccharides, many sialyloligosaccharides are found in
the glycosylated products. Among these sialyloligosaccharides, α2-3
sialosides are considered to be an unnatural type of oligosaccharides,
resulting from misrecognition of β-xylosides by the glycolipid
biosynthesis pathway21 or an end-capping
structure instead of phosphorylated Xyl.6 To confirm the structure of the sialoside bond of the glycosylated
products, they were digested by α2-3 sialidase or α2-3,6
sialidase and then analyzed by LC–MS/MS. The result is shown
in Figure 6. NeuAc-Hex-Xyl-Ser-C12
(m/z 870.4089), the most abundant
sialyloligosaccharide, completely disappeared by digestion with both
sialidases (Figure 6A). Similarly, NeuAc-Hex-Xyl(P)-Ser-C12 (m/z 950.3752) and NeuAc-Hex-Hex-Xyl-Ser-C12 (m/z 1032.4617) were digested by both sialidases (Figure 6B,C), so the sialoside
bonds of these products were determined to be an α2-3 sialoside
bond. In contrast, NeuAc-Hex-Hex-Xyl(P)-Ser-C12 (m/z 1112.4280) was digested only by α2-3,6
sialidase and not by α2,3 sialidase (Figure 6D). This result suggests the structure to
be an α2-6 sialoside.

sialidase digestion.

axis are set equal.

NeuAcα2-3Hex-Xyl
is regarded as an end-capping structure
when disaccharide structure Hex-Xyl is not phosphorylated properly
by FAM20B.5 Therefore, the proportions
of this sialyloligosaccharide show a tendency of Xyl-Ser-C12 to not
be incorporated into the GAG biosynthetic pathway. Moreover, NeuAcα2-3Hex-Hex-Xyl
is also considered to be an end-capping structure because the C3 position
of the nonreducing end, Hex, where GlcA should be attached, was occupied
by sialic acid. In contrast, some sialyloligosaccharides that were
phosphorylated on the Xyl residue were also detected. This result
did not agree with the GAG biosynthesis mechanism controlled by FAM20B,
suggesting that the sialylation might occur by a different biosynthesis
mechanism.

In addition, the sialyltetrasaccharide (NeuAcα2-6Hex-Hex-Xyl(P)-Ser-C12)
had another sialoside bond structure. Recently, sialylation on the
Gal residue of the linkage tetrasaccharide in the human inter-α-trypsin
inhibitor was reported.44 This implies
that α2-6 sialoside might be added on the Gal residues of the
linkage tetrasaccharide during GAG biosynthesis. Therefore, NeuAcα2-6-Hex-Hex-Xyl(P)-Ser-C12
might be a novel intermediate structure of GAG biosynthesis. On the
basis of these results, sialylation on the β-xyloside might
be a key factor to understanding the GAG biosynthetic mechanism. In
this regard, Xyl-Ser-C12 could be a powerful tool to investigate the
GAG biosynthetic mechanism because Xyl-Ser-C12 is able to prime phosphorylated,
GAG-type, and sialyloligosaccharides all at the same time.

Quantitative
Analysis of the Glycosylated Products Obtained
from β-Xylosides
To confirm the relationship between
the structure and priming ability of each β-xyloside, the proportions
of the glycosylated products were calculated and compared. In the
same manner as that for the glycosylated products of Xyl-Ser-C12,
those of other β-xylosides were deduced by LC–MS/MS and
enzymatic digestion (shown in Supporting Information). The proportions were calculated from the peak areas of the glycosylated
products. The results are shown in Table S4 and Figure 7. Among
the β-xylosides, Xyl-Ser-C12 primed the maximum amount of glycosylated
products (Table S4). Among the glycosylated
products of Xyl-Ser-C12, the most abundant product was a phosphorylated
pentasaccharide (HexNAc-HexA-Hex-Hex-Xyl(P)-Ser-C12) (20.91%). The
sum of the proportion of phosphorylated products obtained from Xyl-Ser-C12
is about 50%. These phosphorylated products have not been detected
in previous studies22,45 (Figure 7A). These results suggest that Xyl-Ser-C12
works as an appropriate substrate for Xyl phosphorylation, and the
phosphorylated products were easily excreted into the medium. Furthermore,
the sum of the proportion of GAG-type oligosaccharides, which were
composed of the linkage tetrasaccharides, was about 40% (Figure 7B). Taking into consideration
the fact that the phosphorylated products were the intermediates of
GAG biosynthesis, a large part of Xyl-Ser-C12 was incorporated into
the GAG biosynthesis pathway. The total proportion of the sialyloligosaccharides
was approximately 17%. Therefore, some part of Xyl-Ser-C12 taken by
NHDF cells may be recognized by sialyltransferases.

Figure 7 Total proportion of (A)
phosphorylated, (B) GAG-type, and (C) sialyloligosaccharides
elongated on the β-xylosides. Double asterisk (**) denotes p < 0.01 in Student’s t-test.

Similar to Xyl-Ser-C12, Gly-(Xyl)Ser-C12
also initiated mainly
GAG-type oligosaccharides. The most abundant product was the phosphorylated
pentasaccharide (HexNAc-HexA-Hex-Hex-Xyl(P)-GlySer-C12) (36.75%).
In comparison with Xyl-Ser-C12, phosphorylated products and GAG-type
oligosaccharides were slightly but not significantly increased (Figure 7A,B). In addition,
it is notable that the amount of sialyloligosaccharides elongated
on Gly-(Xyl)Ser-C12 was significantly lower than that on Xyl-Ser-C12
(Figure 7C). These
results suggest that the Gly residue flanked by the Ser residue in
Gly-(Xyl)Ser-C12 affects the efficiency of Xyl phosphorylation and
sialylation. Gly-(Xyl)Ser-C12 would be a better primer to construct
GAG-like oligosaccharide libraries because α2-3 sialylated oligosaccharides,
which are the end-capping structure, were undesirable to obtain phosphorylated
and GAG-type oligosaccharides.

Xyl-Thr-C12 and Gly-(Xyl)Ser-C12
gave fewer species of elongated
oligosaccharides than either Xyl-Ser-C12 or Gly-(Xyl)Ser-C12 (Table S4). They initiated large amounts of sialyloligosaccharides,
such as NeuAcα2-3Hex-Xyl-R, and small amounts of both phosphorylated
and GAG-type oligosaccharides (Figure 7A–C). Therefore, these β-xylosides, which
are composed of a Xyl-Thr residue, are unlikely to work well for Xyl
phosphorylation.

Conclusions
In this study, we established
an analytical method for phosphorylated
oligosaccharides elongated on the saccharide primers, by which a wide
variety of oligosaccharides could be observed using LC–MS/MS.
Most of these oligosaccharides seemed to be synthesized in accordance
with the GAG biosynthetic pathway (Figure 8). These results indicate that the β-xylosides
prime phosphorylated GAG-type oligosaccharides in living cells. In
addition, the comparison of the relative amounts of these oligosaccharides
revealed that the proportions of phosphorylated oligosaccharides and
sialylated oligosaccharides were completely different between the
primers. To our best knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate
that the amino acid residues around the Xyl attachment position strongly
affect phosphorylation efficiency. Taking into consideration the GAG
biosynthetic pathway, our results suggest that both phosphorylation
and α2-3 sialylation are related to the GAG priming ability
of the primers. Notably, these oligosaccharides included phosphorylated
α2-6 sialyloligosaccharides, implying that both sialylation
and Xyl phosphorylation might orchestrate the GAG biosynthesis mechanism.
However, the function of the α2-6 sialylation in the GAG biosynthesis
mechanism remains to be discussed further, thus in-depth analysis
of the phosphorylated sialyloligosaccharides is needed.

Figure 8 Speculated
biosynthesis pathways of glycosylated products elongated
on a saccharide primer. The biosynthesis is initiated with galactosylation
on the Xyl. The disaccharide is phosphorylated for GAG-type oligosaccharide
biosynthesis. The phosphorylated disaccharide is used as an intermediate
of the GAG biosynthetic pathway. Dephosphorylation can occur during
both GlcA addition on the phosphorylated trisaccharide and GalNAc
addition on the phosphorylated tetrasaccharide. The phosphorylated
trisaccharide can be modified by α2-6-linked NeuAc for sialyl
GAG synthesis. Without the Xyl phosphorylation, the disaccharide can
be capped by α2-3-linked NeuAc. Gal, HexA, and HexNAc residues
can be sulfated during the biosynthesis.

β-Xylosides with amino acid residues in their aglycone
were
synthesized by chemoenzymatic synthesis to examine the effect of the
aglycone structure on the priming ability. The amino acid residues
strongly affect the structure of oligosaccharides, especially phosphorylated
oligosaccharides. The β-xylosides synthesized in this study
demonstrated high priming ability for a wide variety of oligosaccharides,
providing a chemical tool not only to obtain GAG-type oligosaccharides
but also to investigate the GAG biosynthesis mechanism. This study
is an important step in the development of a new methodology using
β-xylosides to clarify the GAG biosynthesis mechanism and for
the comparison of glycosaminoglycomics between different cells.

Methods
Materials
NHDF cells, NHDF growth supplements, gentamicin,
amphotericin B, and FibroLife S2 Medium Complete Kit were purchased
from Kurabou, Japan. Medium 106 was purchased from Thermofisher Scientific,
Japan. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Japan,
Wako Pure Chemical Industries, and Tokyo Chemical Industries. Unless
otherwise stated, all commercially available reagents and solvents
were of reagent grade and used without purification.

Synthesis of
β-Xylosides (Compounds 1–4)
All data and procedures for the synthesis of β-xylosides
are described in the Supporting Information.

GAG Priming in Cells
To investigate the priming ability
of the β-xylosides, glycosylation of the β-xylosides was
examined with NHDF cells. NHDF cells were cultured in medium 106 with
NHDF growth supplements, gentamicin, and amphotericin B at 37 °C
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. NHDF cells
(4 × 105) in a six-well plate were seeded with the
FibroLife S2 Medium Complete kit containing 25 μM Xyl-Ser-C12,
Xyl-Thr-C12, Gly-(Xyl)Ser-C12, or Gly-(Xyl)Thr-C12 for 48 h.

Purification
of Glycosylated Products
Purification
of glycosylated products was carried out as previously reported, with
some modifications.22 The glycosylated
products were collected from the culture medium using a solid-phase
extraction cartridge. To maximize the recovery of anionic products,
tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (TBA-HSO4) was added
into the culture medium as an ion pair reagent. First, 1 mL of 7.5
M urea was added to the culture medium (about 1.5 mL) and stirred
well to dissolve the precipitate completely in the medium, followed
by the addition of 2.5 mL of 20 mM TBA-HSO4. Next, the
solution was applied to the cartridge Strata-X, 60 mg, 3 cc (Phenomenex,
CA) conditioned with methanol (MeOH) and equilibrated with 10 mM TBA-HSO4. After the cartridge was washed with 2 mL of water and 2
mL of 30% MeOH, the glycosylated products were eluted with 1 mL of
50% MeOH, 70% of MeOH, and 1 mL of 90% MeOH. The eluent fractions
were collected, and the solvent was removed under reduced vacuum.

The samples extracted by SPE were passed through the cation exchange
resin to remove the TBA ion, which can reduce MS sensitivity by its
ion suppression effect. The residues were dissolved with 200 μL
of water/MeOH/2-propanol (1/1/1, v/v) and passed through 200 μL
of the cation exchange resin (Muromachi Chemica, Japan) washed with
MeOH and protonated with 2% formic acid. After removal of the solvent
by vacuum distillation, the residues were stored at −20 °C.

Liquid Chromatography–Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry
(LC–ESI-MS) of Glycosylated Products
All solvents
and reagents used in the LC–MS experiment were of LC–MS
grade. The glycosylated products and the digested samples were subjected
to LC–ESI-MS analysis. MS analysis was performed by a Synapt
G2-S (quadruple/time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with an
ion mobility cell) coupled online by an ACQUITY UPLC H-Class Bio (Nihon
Waters, Japan). Instrument control, data acquisition, and analysis
were performed with MassLynx software v.4.1. The samples were
dissolved in water/MeCN (1/3, v/v) and injected into ACQUITY UPLC
BEH Glycan, 1.7 μm (2.1 mm i.d. × 150 mm; Nihon Waters,
Japan). Fifty millimolar ammonium formate buffer (pH 7.8) was used
as mobile phase A, MeCN as mobile phase B, and 20 mM phosphoric acid
in 50% MeCN as mobile phase C. Before every analysis, the high-performance
liquid chromatography system and the column were flushed with mobile
phase C at 0.3 mL/min for 3 min to avoid undesirable absorption of
phosphorylated compounds and then washed with a mobile phase A/mobile
phase B = 50:50 solution at 0.3 mL/min for 2 min. The column was equilibrated
with 95% B, and the sample was eluted with a 95–50% B linear
gradient for 40 min at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The column temperature
was set at 60 °C. The m/z recorded
ranged from 50 to 1500 in the resolution mode (about 20 000).
The MS was calibrated by NaI, and the lock mass spray was set up with
Leu-enkephalin (m/z 554.2615: [M
– H]−). The quadruple profile was optimized
to not detect the background phosphate ion. Other ESI conditions were
set as follows: capillary voltage, −1.5 kV; cone voltage, 30
V; sample offset, 60 V; source temperature, 120 °C; desolvation
temperature, 500 °C; cone gas, 50 L/h; trap CE, 2; trans CE,
2.

All MS/MS spectra were recorded in a high definition multiple
reaction monitoring mode. Wideband enhancement calibration was carried
out using Glu-Fibrinopeptide B. Trap CE was set in accordance with
the m/z values of the precursor
ions (Tables S5–S8). Assignment
of the fragment ions was carried out following the nomenclature introduced
by Domon and Costello.46

The proportions
of glycosylated products were calculated by dividing
the peak area of each product by the sum of peak areas of the glycosylated
products.

Enzymatic Digestion of the Glycosylated Products
C-ABC,
C-ACII, heparitinase I, heparitinase II, and heparitinase III were
purchased from Seikagaku Corporation. β-d-Galactosidase
was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. α2-3 Sialidase
was purchased from Takara Bio and α2,3-6 sialidase from Nakarai
Tesque. The purified glycosylated products were dissolved in 100 μL
of water. For CS/DS digestion, 100 μL of 100 mM Tris–HCl
buffer (pH 8.0) containing 250 mU of C-ABC, 25 mU of C-ACII, and 0.005%
BSA was added. For CS digestion, 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH
6.0) containing 250 mU of C-ACII and 0.005% BSA was added. For HS
digestion, 100 mM sodium
acetate and 50 mM calcium acetate (pH 7.0) containing 250 mU of heparitinase
I, II, and III were added. For β-galactosidase digestion, 100
μL of 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) containing 1000 U of
β-d-galactosidase was added. For α2-3 sialidase
digestion, 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) and 10 μL of
a2-3 sialidase were added. For α2,3-6 sialidase digestion, 100
mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 2000 mU of α2,3-6
sialidase was added. The mixture solutions were maintained at 37 °C
for 10 min (α2-3 sialidase), 2 h (C-ABC, ACII), or 17 h (HSases,
β-galactosidase, α2,3-6 sialidase digestion). All of the
reactions were quenched by heating for 30 s in a boiling water bath.
The samples were passed through 200 μL of cation exchange resin,
concentrated, and stored at −20 °C before use.
