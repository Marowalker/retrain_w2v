The
potential of lignosulfonates as widely underutilized byproducts
of the pulp and paper industry for the synthesis of a biodegradable
pesticide carrier system was assessed in this study. Design of experiment
software MODDE Pro was for the first time applied to optimize lignosulfonate
granule production using Myceliophthora thermophila laccase as a biocatalyst. Enzymatic cross-linking was monitored
using size exclusion chromatography coupled online to multiangle laser
light scattering, viscosity measurement, and enzyme activity. The
determined optimal and experimentally confirmed incubation conditions
were: 33 °C, 30 cm3/min O2 supply, and
190 min reaction time. The granules were thereafter loaded with 2
g/kg 3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid (Dicamba), a broad-spectrum
herbicide. According to the HPLC analysis, complete release of Dicamba
was achieved after 48 h of release. This study showed the green production
of a 100% lignosulfonate-based biodegradable solid carrier with potential
application in agriculture.

==== Body
Introduction
Lignin is a major byproduct of the pulp
and paper industry, produced
at a quantity of 50–60 million tons per year. It is an extremely
valuable biopolymer and a renewable resource, but today only 2% of
the total lignin extracted is exploited for value-added products,
while the rest of it is mostly burned for low-cost energy production.1 Therefore, there is a need for lignin utilization
in the production of value-added materials to make the biorefinery
process more profitable. Thanks to advances in valorization of each
renewable component of the lignocellulosic biomass, new marketable
products are being developed.1,2 Using enzymes to modify
lignin-based structures avoids the use of toxic chemicals, thus providing
a valid biotechnological approach.1 Laccases
belong to a very broad and diverse superfamily of multicopper oxidases
(MCOs): they generally contain a cluster of four copper atoms, which
constitute their active site. Thanks to their natural origin, nontoxicity,
mild operating conditions in which they are active, and the very broad
range of oxidized substrates, fungal enzymes like laccases are very
valuable tools for industrial applications.3,4 Laccases
can be used to valorize lignosulfonates by utilizing their ability
to generate reactive radicals that cross-link their side chains and
form long-chain polymers.5−7 No addition of mediators to the
reaction mixture is needed and only oxygen has to be supplied; it
is possible, therefore, to control laccase reactivity by just increasing
or diminishing the oxygen supply.8 This
approach is useful to alter lignin properties like molecular weight
and water solubility and make the polymer more suitable for applications
as binders, plasticizers, and adhesives or in agriculture for the
production of novel agrochemical carriers, as well as in storage and
release systems.9

The massive use
of pesticides poses serious public concerns since
very large amounts of substances applied to ensure a good harvest
can be dangerous for human health and natural ecosystems. Dispersion
of pesticide residues due to overapplication or misuse often results
in groundwater pollution and consequently in eutrophication, toxicity,
and air pollution, as well as in a decrease of soil quality.10 Approximately 95% of herbicides are released
into the environment.11 Therefore, there
is a need to optimize the use of pesticides and an urgency to introduce
ecological strategies for their application and effectiveness in the
field, to avoid massive environmental pollution. Innovative solutions
are needed to allow a better control of the use of pesticides as valuable
tools for agriculture in the future.12,13 Agrochemical
carriers and delivery systems are increasingly being recognized as
important systems to deliver agrochemicals and minimize leaching,
thereby preventing environmental pollution and ecosystem damage while
reducing adverse human health effects.14 As summarized by Campos et al.,15 currently
used products are generally made from synthetic materials such as
petroleum-based polymers, for example, polysulfone, polyacrylonitrile,
polyurethane, and polystyrene.16 Using
low-cost, bio-based polymers like lignosulfonate, recovered from process
side streams, is an innovative and promising solution that also promotes
circular bioeconomy and environmentally friendly processes. A study
by Huang et al. shows the production of an environmentally friendly
polymer structure for the encapsulation of photosensitive pesticides.
Also Liu et al. developed a pH-responsive controlled-release nanoparticle
from sustainable resources.17,18 Lignin-based products
generally decompose to form humic acid, a natural soil fertility-enhancing
material.19−21 For this study, Dicamba was chosen as the model pesticide
because of its avid use in agriculture. Dicamba is resistant to oxidation
and hydrolysis and stable in weak acid and alkaline solutions; it
is highly soluble in water (6.5 g/L at 25 °C), which can be a
problem in case of runoff events because it is highly mobile in soil
(it does not bind to soil particles) and therefore can easily reach
and solubilize in groundwater and be dispersed in the environment.
It is rather persistent in soil, with a half-life ranging between
1 and 4 weeks depending on soil type. It is a very good representative
of many products that are currently used and its properties are similar
to those of other products.22,23

The overall objective
of the present study is to investigate the
possibility to produce a stable biodegradable bio-based carrier system
for pesticides by utilizing enzymatic cross-linking of lignosulfonates
to produce granules.

Results and Discussion
Synthesizing the Binder
for Granule Production
The
lignosulfonate-based binder was produced through laccase-mediated
cross-linking of LS, resulting in water-insoluble, high-molecular-weight,
and high-viscosity structures. By utilizing the knowledge gained from
preliminary experimental data, a two-leveled full factorial design
was chosen. As shown in Table 1, the MODDE Pro design of experiment proposed 11 cross-linking
reactions that were performed and respective responses (molecular
weights and viscosities) were recorded. In general, the molecular
weight and viscosity increased with increasing temperature, reaction
time, and oxygen supply. However, the viscosity did not always increase
at the same level as the molecular weight, indicating that the oxygen
supply and temperature influence the chain formation in the cross-linked
structure.24

The conditions provided
by the MODDE Pro design of experiment were very useful for the optimization
process as they lead to the production of cross-linked lignosulfonates
with suitable properties for making granules. Through probability
analysis, the optimal incubation conditions were determined as 33
°C, 30 cm3/min O2 supply, and 190 min reaction
time, as shown in Figure 1. The resulting binder showed very good properties in terms
of sprayability and granule formation as well as very good reproducibility.
Previously, the design of experiment software MODDE Pro was also proven
useful in determining the optimal conditions to obtain lignin nanoparticles25 and in revealing the key factors and their influences
in cocoa bean fermentation.26 In fact,
statistical modeling using design of experiments (DoE) and response
surface methodology (RSM), as shown in Figure 1, are useful in simultaneously dealing with
multiple factors in experimental design, which can otherwise be extremely
challenging and cost-ineffective. DoE has been used extensively in
food technology for process optimization, microbiology, various sensory
analyses,27 and as demonstrated in this
study can be used for determining the optimal conditions for synthesizing
cross-linked materials. This shows the ability of the program to show
the interaction of responses (temperature, binder concentration, and
pH). The cross-linking process during the enzymatic reaction is not
entirely clear yet, but the statistic model was proven to be useful
anyhow. By providing the molecular weight through size exclusion chromatography
coupled to multiangle laser light scattering, also the cross-linking
structure could be incorporated and therefore helped strengthen the
statistic model applied.

Figure 1 Response contour plot of the optimized conditions
for lignosulfonate
cross-linking.

The resulting binder was then
analyzed for its molecular weight,
viscosity, and chemical properties. Remarkably, the molecular weight
exceeded the predicted molecular weight by far being on average 4485
kDa with radii of around 70 nm, whereas the viscosity was still low
at 1.47 × 10–1 Pa s, which lead to a binder
that was still sprayable but with a tighter cross-linked structure
advantageous for granule production. This exceeded the target, as
2000 kDa was the initial aim to have a suitable material for coating.
Indeed, the MODDE Pro design of experiment was very useful in establishing
the optimal conditions for producing the binder that produced stable
granules. The granules were further analyzed using FTIR spectroscopy
including all DoE products. Figure 2 shows the spectra obtained from native lignosulfonates,
experiment N1 with a low degree of cross-linking, and experiment N8
which formed the insoluble material and the optimized binder. N1 and
N8 were two of the reactions performed for obtaining the optimized
binder. By comparing these spectra, the cross-linking behavior can
be best illustrated. In unison with the molecular-weight responses
from size exclusion chromatography, they show the difference in bond
formation depending on the reaction conditions.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of native
lignosulfonates and enzymatically cross-linked
lignosulfonates at different conditions in terms of oxygen supply,
reaction time, and temperature.

In the general information area of the spectra, a very broad band
between 3650 and 3100 cm–1 is visible, corresponding
to the presence of −OH stretches. The presence of an additional
band in this region for experiments N8 and N1, specifically between
3450 and 3300 cm–1, can be due to the presence of
water in solid samples that can generate a spurious band. Between
3000 and 2840 cm–1, there is a band that appears
pointier and sharper in the native LS and in N1, indicating the asymmetric
stretching of C–H and fully saturated carbons (−CH3 and −CH2-alkanes), while for N8 and the
optimized binder, the conformation seems broader, indicating the presence
of −OH stretching and hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimers.28 This can be a possible marker of the oxidation
of lignosulfonate and of the new bonds that are formed. The triplet
present at 1506, 1453, and 1422 cm–1 is attributable
to the stretching of C=C, CH2, CH3, aldehydes,
and methoxy (−OCH3) groups. The doublet at 1370–1330
cm–1 is moreover characteristic of CO2 symmetric stretches.29 The peaks between
1300 and 1000 cm–1 depend on various vibration bands
such as C–O, C–H, and C=O. For example, the medium
peak at 1260 cm–1 corresponds to C–O stretching
and carboxylic acid dimers; the band at 1216 cm–1 as well as the highest one at 1020 cm–1 correspond
to para-substituted benzenes.30,31

Figure 3 shows a
smaller part of the spectrum, only the fingerprint region between
1700 and 680 cm–1. To ease the view, spectra were
shifted vertically. At 1390 cm–1, in the highly
cross-linked experiments (N8 and optimized binder), a small peak appeared,
together with another small but broader one at 1375 cm–1; these two bands can indicate the presence of more aldehydes, CO2– stretches, and carboxylic acid salts.
At 1160 cm–1, a small band is present in all of
the curves except the untreated LS; this medium absorption band corresponds
to C–O and C=O stretching and mono-substituted benzenes.
Some different conformations of the bands are also visible between
1100 and 1060 cm–1, the area that corresponds to
the asymmetric stretch of aliphatic ethers and to aliphatic primary
and secondary alcohols: the behavior of the N8 and optimized binder
curves in this part of the spectrum is similar, while it looks much
different for the native LS curve and N1. As is clarified in the zoom
of Figure 3, in fact,
a small peak around 1065 cm–1 is present for N8
and optimized binder, and there is also a shift in the peaks from
1090 cm–1 (for the native LS and N1) to 1080 cm–1 (for the N8 and optimized binder), highlighted in
a black arrow. Other differences like these can be seen at wavelengths
950, 920, and 880 cm–1, all signifying ring vibrations,
C–H bending, meta-substituted benzenes, as well as vinyl esters.
Finally, at 830 cm–1, a small peak, present in all
spectra except the native LS, can be observed. At this wavelength,
also isopropyl groups and functional groups like RR1-C=CHR2 absorb, suggesting the formation of new bonds between different
LS residues.30−34

Synthesis of Pure Lignin-Based
Granules and Dicamba Release
The granules produced using
the lab granulation device had a size
range of 2–4 mm diameter and were visually characterized by
electron microscopy (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Scanning electron microscopy of granules produced from enzymatically
cross-linked lignosulfonate at ×10, ×100, and ×500
magnification for surface identification.

The agglomerate structure seen in Figure 4 was a result of the production process.
The granules were formed from the powder and glued together by the
optimized lignin binder synthesized by enzymatic cross-linking. The
granules had pores and cavities where, ideally, the added Dicamba
solution could penetrate and be entrapped in the cross-linked lignosulfonate
structure in type 1 granules. Once added to the buffer solutions,
the herbicide should then be released. In type 2 granules, Dicamba
was added during the cross-linking process, and therefore a tighter
entrapment was expected, since the herbicide could be built into the
grafted structure. Figure 5a,b shows the release profile of Dicamba in different buffer
solutions. Also pH had a minimum effect on the release of the herbicide
showing no significant differences after 6 h, where all of the Dicamba
was released in Milli-Q water and in phosphate buffer of pH 7. Whereas
at pH 9 and pH 3, Dicamba was only completely released after 48 h,
showing that at these pH values Dicamba is better bound to the granules.
In a study on pesticide mobility, Dicamba was found to be relatively
mobile. pH had a strong influence on Dicamba mobility; at pH less
than 4.2, Dicamba was not readily leached from soils. In a pH range
of 5.0–6.7, Dicamba mobility increased with increasing pH,
but at pH above 6.7, there was no increase in mobility.35 For weak aromatic acids such as Dicamba and
2,4-D, phytotoxicity increases as soil pH increases and reaches
a maximum at pH 6.5.36 Anyhow the major
amount of Dicamba was released after 3 h for all experiments. Although
different entrapment methods were used, both granule types show the
same release properties. It is very likely that the hypothesis that
the addition during the grafting process would lead to a better entrapment
was wrong due to the fact that Dicamba rarely binds to soil particles.
The produced granules, anyhow, are designed biodegradable, and therefore
behave similarly to soil.22 Therefore,
the desired bonding of Dicamba and the granule material was not reached.
The shown burst release is unfavorable for the desired application.
Roy et al. comprehensively summarized that matrix release systems
are not very well developed yet, but hold the possibility to revolutionize
the field. This first prototype of a carrier system will be further
developed. The lack of binding capability of the pure lignosulfonates
matrix for Dicamba has to be further investigated. Compared to other
delivery systems such as nano-encapsulation, a controlled release
has yet to be developed.17,37 By further tuning the
enzymatic cross-linking process and possible addition of other materials
to the reaction, the incorporation of Dicamba could be improved in
the future.

Figure 5 Release of Dicamba from the lignosulfonate granules into different
buffer systems at different pH values: (a) type 1 granules and (b)
type 2 granules.

Although only minor differences
in terms of Dicamba release were
detected, the two granule types displayed quite different behavior
in terms of stability. In Figure 6, pictures of the granules before and after the release
studies are shown. Although both granule types look the same prior
to the release experiment, after 1 week, major differences can be
observed depending on the pH values of the experiments as well as
the granule type. In Figure 6a, the type 1 granules have a more compact structure especially
at pH 7, whereas at pH 9, their structure is very much degraded. This
behavior is due to the tendency of lignosulfonate to ionize in the
alkaline region. Overall, the structural integrity of type 1 granules
at pH 3 and pH 7 as well as in Milli-Q water is very good. Type 2
granules (Figure 6b)
on the other hand were less stable than type 1 granules under all
conditions. Granule sizes significantly decreased after the release
studies, showing the faster degradation and less stability of type
2 granules. In addition to the good performance concerning the stability
of type 1 granules, very good water retention of the granules was
observed. As can be seen in Figure 6 also, the granules were hydrophilic, thereby absorbed
water. This was also observed by Legras-Lecarpentier et al. when enzymatically
cross-linked lignosulfonates were used to produce alginate–lignosulfonate
fertilizer granules.38,39

and after drying.

higher form stability and water-holding capacity.

Conclusions
The technique used for producing type 1 granules
resulted in stable
granules even after 1 week of release in buffer solutions at pH 3
and pH 7 as well as in Milli-Q water. The granule structure facilitated
impregnation with Dicamba and consecutively its release. These results
show the successful design of a fully biodegradable carrier system
using the MODDE Pro design of experiment suitable for pesticide release.
In addition to acting as a carrier system, the cross-linked lignosulfonates
can also serve as soil conditioners since they decompose into humic
acid. Therefore, this study showed the green production of a 100%
lignosulfonate-based biodegradable solid carrier with potential application
in agriculture.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
lignosulfonate used in this work originated
from spent liquor of the sulfite wood pulping process and was supplied
by a company partner. A laccase with an average activity of 1273 U/mL
from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL)
purchased from Novozymes (Novozym 51003) was used for lignosulfonate
(LS) cross-linking. The herbicide 3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid
(Dicamba) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich GmbH (Germany). All other
chemicals were of reagent grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich GmbH
(Germany).

Laccase Activity Assay
Laccase activity
was determined
based on the oxidation of ABTS azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid) into green-blue-colored cation radical.2 For the activity assay, a 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) and
10 mM ABTS solution was prepared. The reaction was performed in a
96-microwell plate. For the blank, 170 μL of phosphate buffer
was added to 50 μL of the ABTS solution. For the enzyme reaction,
170 μL of enzyme solution was prepared in triplicates and added
to 50 μL of the ABTS solution. Measurements at the UV/vis spectrophotometer
started immediately, at 420 nm.  where ε is the extinction coefficient
at 420 nm [mM–1 cm–1]; d is the path length [cm]; Vtotal is the total reaction volume [mL]; Venzyme is the enzymatic solution volume [mL]; and DF is the dilution factor.

The laccase activity refers to the amount of enzyme necessary to
catalyze the conversion of 1 nmol of substrate per second in specific
assay conditions and was given as nKat.

Cross-Linking of Lignosulfonates
Dried lignosulfonate
was used to prepare 8% (w/w) lignosulfonate solutions for the binder,
and 9% (w/w) lignosulfonate solutions were used for the production
of cross-linked LS powder for making the granules. The pH was adjusted
to 7 using 5 M NaOH. When the conditions of temperature and oxygen
content were reached, the reaction started by injecting 166.7 nkat/mL
MtL. The level of oxygen saturation in the solution was monitored
with oxygen sensors positioned on optical spots previously immobilized
in the reaction vessels (FireSting-O2, PyroScience, Germany).

Design of Experiment for Optimal Binder
The design
of experiment software MODDE Pro (Sartorius, Germany) was used to
optimize the production of a suitable LS binder for granule production.
The optimal reaction condition combinations were determined by assessing
the interaction between temperature, oxygen flow, and reaction time,
as shown in Table 2. Molecular weight and viscosity were chosen
as responses. This method is readily applied in many fields for similar
applications.40,41

Size Exclusion
Chromatography
The molecular weight
of cross-linked lignosulfonates was monitored using a liquid chromatography
system equipped with a quaternary/binary pump, an autosampler 1260
series from Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA), a DAD (diode array
detector) and an refractive index (RI) detector system (Agilent Technologies
1260 Infinity), as well as a MALLS HELEOS DAWN II detector from Wyatt
Technologies (Dernbach, Germany). The SEC column system consisted
of a precolumn PL aquagel-OH MIXED Guard (PL1149-1840, 8 μm,
7.5 × 50 mm2, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) and a separation
column PL aquagel-OH MIXED H (PL1549-5800, 4.6 × 250 mm2, 8 μm, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) with a mass range of 6–10 000
kDa. The lignin samples were diluted with the mobile phase to a concentration
of 1 mg/mL. The injection volume was 100 μL. The system was
operated with 50 mM NaNO3/3 mM NaN3 and had
a total runtime of 90 min. The Agilent Software Openlab Chemstation
CDS as well the ASTRA 7 software from Wyatt Technologies were used
for data acquisition and data analysis. BSA was used for the normalization,
band broadening, and alignment of the MALLS detector.

Viscosity Measurement
The rheological properties of
the samples were measured with a rotational rheometer CVO 50 (Bohlin
Instruments, U.K.). Cross-linked lignosulfonate (1 mL) was placed
on the plate, and the measurement was carried out at 20 °C, at
a shear rate of 200 s–1, and a 3 s time delay. A
4° conical plate with a diameter of 40 mm was used.

Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy
Samples of
5 mL of cross-linked lignosulfonates were stored at −80 °C
in falcon tubes until lyophilization was performed at 21 °C and
0.1 mbar for 2–3 days. The resulting powder was analyzed using
FTIR spectroscopy (Spectrum 100, PerkinElmer). The sample was placed
on the ATR sample plate and pressed on it with a knob; the applied
pressure was monitored by the software to ensure that it would be
the same for all of the samples (149–150). Absorbance spectra
were then obtained from 50 scans between the range of 600 and 4000
cm–1 for each sample in triplicate. The average
spectra from the triplicates were then identified, and the spectra
from all of the samples were normalized for the entire wavelength
range.

Granule Production and Loading with Dicamba
Two types
of granules were produced differing in the mode of Dicamba loading.
In general, each formulation consisted of 9% cross-linked LS powder.
A lab-scale version mimicking an industrial granulation process was
used for producing the granules. Essentially a small amount of the
powder was put into the beaker of the granulation device and continuously
sprayed with cross-linked 8% lignosulfonate as binder. The formed
granules were then dried at 70 °C for 24 h. To load the granules
with Dicamba, two approaches were used, as shown in Table 3. The
amount of Dicamba per kg of finished granules (2 g/kg) was the
same for both procedures.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Scanning
electron microscopy
was performed on a Hitachi TM 3030 (Hitachi High-Technologies Europe
GmbH, Germany) instrument to morphologically characterize the granules.
To increase resolution, the samples were sputtered with platinum using
a Leica EM ACE200 Vacuum Coater (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Germany).

Release Studies
The release of the herbicide Dicamba
from the granules was investigated in Milli-Q water, 50 mM phosphate
buffer pH 3 and pH 7, and 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 9. The experiments
were performed in falcon tubes (Fisher Scientific GmbH, Schwerte)
containing 1 g of granules (with 2 mg of Dicamba) and 50 mL of solution.
Experiments were conducted in triplicate at 23 °C at 80 rpm.
Supernatants were regularly collected (0, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168
h) for HPLC analysis. The falcon tubes were refilled with 50 mL of
the respective solution. The withdrawn samples were filtered with
0.45 μm syringe filters prior to HPLC analysis. The Agilent
HPLC1200 series (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with an Agilent
1200 series DAD detector was used to quantify the released Dicamba
at 234 nm with measurement at 282 nm as qualifier. The injection volume
was set to 25 μL at 20 °C for standards and samples on
an Agilent 1200 series autosampler equipped with an autosampler thermostat
from the same series. A Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (3 × 150 mm2; particle size, 2.7 μm) column purchased from Agilent
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) was applied for separation. The column
was heated to 40 °C and operated with a flow rate of 0.6 mL min–1. The eluent system was composed of ultrapure water
and acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich), each with 0.1% formic acid. The
gradient profile is given in Table 4. To establish constant starting
conditions, a post runtime of 5 min was included in the program. Standards
were prepared in lignosulfonate solutions at the respective pH.
