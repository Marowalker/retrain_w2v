Introduction
Cross-dehydrogenative
coupling (CDC) that combines two C–H
bonds to form a new carbon–carbon (C–C) bond has attracted
much attention of organic chemists in the past decade.1−6 Traditional cross-coupling reactions utilize prefunctionalized starting
precursors as organohalides and/or organometallic derivatives. They
lead to stoichiometric amounts of waste, whereas couplings via CDC
of C(sp2)–H bonds are economical and powerful tools
to synthesize complex heterocycles.7 These
methods have been studied by employing various metal catalysts, organocatalysts,
and photocatalysts to synthesize a wide range of organic molecules.
In quest of other efficient and green organic transformations, direct
functionalization of C–H bonds with metal catalyst plays a
vital role in all areas of chemistry.8−12 Among them, palladium-catalyzed CDC reactions have
appeared as one of the most significant new approaches in organic
synthesis.13−23 A few protocols have been reported with palladium to access fused
heterocycles via an intramolecular CDC.7,24

The
use of direct oxidative intramolecular CDC for imine and enamine
compounds for the construction of fused heterocycles is of interest.
The reported CDC reactions contained a stoichiometric amount of oxidants,
such as PhI(OAc)2,25 MnO2,26 TBHP,27 Cu(OAc)2,28−31 AgOAc,32 and others,33,34 to maintain the catalytic cycle, which produced large amounts of
waste and toxic byproducts. An elegant approach to avoid these limitations
was the use of oxygen as a sole oxidant, which produced water as by-product
after the reaction.25

The heteroaryl
scaffold containing imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine is a
masked form of the 2-aminoimidazole moiety, which
showed prominent biological applications (Figure 1) as anxiolytic (A),35 p38 kinase inhibitor (B),36 anticonvulsant
(C),37 DPP4 inhibitor (D),38 and androgen receptor antagonist (E).39 The synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines
has been previously reported from nitrenoids in the presence of gold
catalysts (Scheme 1a)40 and from pyrimidyl arylamines or
enamines with hypervalent iodine reagent (Scheme 1b).41 Some of
the reported methods need longer reaction times, require starting
materials, which are synthesized in multiple steps, and have limited
substrate scope. Thus, it is necessary to develop a simple and safer
alternative method for these compounds. Herein, we report our initial
results on the synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines
via a tandem reaction of amine and aldehyde derivatives under palladium
catalysis, which involves oxidative CDC in the presence of air as
an oxidant (Scheme 1c). To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of using CDC reaction
to produce fused imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine analogues.

Scheme 1 Various Pathways to Synthesize Imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine
Results and Discussion
Our initial experiment commenced
with the reaction of 1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-amine
(1a) and 2-phenylacetaldehyde (2a) in the
presence of CuCl2 and K2CO3 in toluene
at 80 °C
for 4 h, which resulted in the desired product, phenyl(3-phenylbenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-2-yl)methanone (3a), with a yield
of less than 10% (Table 1, entry 1). Other halogenated metal salts, such as Fe, Pd, Zn, and
Sn, were scrutinized to increase the yield of 3a (entries
2–6), and among them, PdCl2 showed better results
by giving 80% yield of 3a (entry 4, Table 1). Next, we focused on screening
different palladium salts, such as Pd(OAc)2, Pd(OH)2, and Pd(TFA)2 (entries 7–9), to improve
the yield of 3a further and found that PdCl2 was the best among all of these palladium catalysts. After choosing
PdCl2, various bases were also screened (entries 10–12),
among which K2CO3 (entry 4) was found to give
a higher yield of 3a. The evaluation of reaction solvents,
such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (entries 13–16), revealed
that toluene is the preferred solvent for this reaction. The reaction
temperature and the amount of the reagent were also optimized (entries
17–20). The reaction of 1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-amine 1a and 2-phenylacetaldehyde 2a (2 mmol) in the presence of PdCl2 and K2CO3 in toluene at room temperature did not produce 3a (entry 17). The yield of 3a was not high at
elevated temperature (entry 18). Importantly, lowering of the PdCl2 to 2 mol % or increasing to 10 mol % had no impact on the
reaction rate (entries 19 and 20, respectively). The reaction time
was increased from 4 to 6 h, with no change in the yield (entry 21).
Among all of these reaction conditions, the optimized condition was
chosen as entry 4 in Table 1. The structure of 3a was confirmed by X-ray
crystallographic analysis (Table 1; files si_001 and si_002 of
the Supporting Information).42

To examine the scope of the developed
protocol, a series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine derivatives
was synthesized by the reaction
of differently substituted 1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-amines 1 and 2-arylacetaldehyde 2. The results are summarized in Table 2. The starting materials containing electron-donating
groups gave higher yields (3b–f, 3h, and 3m–p) compared to
those of materials containing electron-withdrawing groups (3g, 3i, and 3j–l). The
reaction with a strong electron-withdrawing group, −NO2 (3q), was detected in the crude reaction mixture
using mass spectrometry; however, the isolation was not successful
due to the stability of the compound. An aliphatic aldehyde was used
instead of 2-phenylacetaldehyde for the reaction, which provided none
of the desired compound (3r); our assumption was that
the low stability of enamine may be the reason of failure.

To explore the applicability of the developed reaction
further,
we tested single-ring heterocycles, such as 1H-pyrazol-5-amine
and 1H-imidazol-2-amine, as starting materials. The
reaction succeeded and resulted in satisfactory yields of the corresponding
fused heterocycles 5a–f (Table 3). The formation of
these products in good to excellent yields suggests the generality
of the developed method.

We performed functional
group transformation of compound 3a (Scheme 2) through reduction with NaBH4 to produce alcohol 6a. An attempt to synthesize
the hydrazone derivative of compound 3a resulted in the
formation of compound 7, which
was confirmed by HRMS.

Scheme 2 Applications of Compound 3a
A plausible mechanism is proposed
in Scheme 3 for the
synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine derivatives.
In the proposed mechanism, the
initial step involves the formation of intermediate A by the condensation of 4a with 2a, which
then reacts with Pd(II) to generate intermediate B. The
deprotonation of intermediate B leads to vinyl Pd intermediate C, which undergoes an intramolecular attack with imine to
give seven-membered palladium cycle D. The 1,2-Pd migration
in intermediate D produces six-membered aza cyclic compound E, which may result in the formation of intermediate F or F′ after reductive palladium elimination.
Intermediate F′ could undergo a well-known Wacker–Tsuji
type of oxidation in the presence of Pd (II). Pd(O) was oxidized by
utilizing the oxygen to produce Pd(II), which further could lead to
a π complex species in compound G. This compound
is expected to undergo hydration in the presence of water, which may
lead to compound I, and it could undergo reductive elimination
of Pd to yield compound J that is finally oxidized to
give the desired product, 5a.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have developed a simple, mild, and efficient
method for the synthesis of fused imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines
and pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines via a tandem reaction
of the corresponding 2-arylacetaldehyde and azole-amine in the presence
of PdCl2. The developed protocol will be not only applicable
as a versatile method for the mentioned heterocycles but also useful
to construct complex derivatives.

Procedure
for Reduction by Using NaBH4
A
suspension of compound 3a (1 mmol) in THF/EtOH (4:2 mL)
was cooled to 0 °C, and then slow portionwise addition of NaBH4 (0.5 mmol) was done. The mixture was stirred at 0 °C
for 20 min and at 28 °C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was poured
into ice water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic
layers were washed with water twice and finally with saturated brine
solution once. The combined organic layers were dried over sodium
sulfate and filtered. The volatiles were removed under pressure. The
remaining residue was purified by column chromatography on silica
gel (n-hexane/EtOAc) to yield product 6a.
