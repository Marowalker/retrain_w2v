The
electronic properties of layered materials are directly determined
based on their thicknesses. Remarkable progress has been carried out
on synthesis of wafer-scale atomically molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) layers as a two-dimensional material in the past few years
in order to transform them into commercial products. Although chemical/mechanical
exfoliation techniques are used to obtain a high-quality monolayer
of MoS2, the lack of suitable control in the thickness
and the lateral size of the flakes restrict their benefits. As a result,
a straightforward, effective, and reliable approach is widely demanded
to achieve a large-area MoS2 flake with control in its
thickness for optoelectronic applications. In this study, thick MoS2 flakes are obtained by a short-time bath sonication in dimethylformamide
solvent, which are thinned with the aid of a sequential plasma etching
process using H2, O2, and SF6 plasma.
A comprehensive study has been carried out on MoS2 flakes
based on scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman,
transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron microscopy
measurements, which ultimately leads to a two-cycle plasma thinning
method. In this approach, H2 is used in the passivation step in the first
subcycle, and O2/SF6 plasma acts as an etching
step for removing the MoS2 layers in the second subcycle.
Finally, we show that this technique can be enthusiastically used
to fabricate MoS2-based photodetectors with a considerable
photoresponsivity of 1.39 A/W and a response time of 0.45 s under
laser excitation of 532 nm.

1 Introduction
Today,
two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing
interest because of their outstanding physical and chemical properties.1 Until now, a variety of 2D structures such as
graphene,2,3 transition-metal dichalcogenides4 (MoS2 and WS2), Franckeite,5 monoelemental materials6 (phosphorene, silicene, and germanene), hexagonal boron nitride,7 and layered metal oxide materials8 (In2O3) have been extensively investigated
and widely used in many ongoing research studies. Among these large
number of 2D materials, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has
attracted much attention for its excellent properties such as thickness-tunable
band gap9 and remarkable field effect mobility.10,11 In addition, a MoS2 monolayer (a layer of molybdenum
atoms coupled with layers of sulfur atoms in both sides via van der
Waals interaction) undergoes an indirect to direct gap transition,12 making it a promising candidate for optoelectronic
device applications such as phototransistors,13 photodetectors,14 light emitters,15 solar cells,16 and
so on.

To date, a variety of methods have been established to
prepare
layered MoS2 nanosheets including mechanical exfoliation,17 liquid-phase exfoliation,18 physical/chemical vapor depositions (CVDs),19,20 and hydrothermal synthesis.21 Mechanical
exfoliation is known as a low-throughput technique with difficulty
in achieving desired large-scale monolayers.22 Liquid-phase exfoliation is suitable for mass production. However,
lack of control on sheet size and thickness as well as prolonged high-power
sonications are responsible for nanometric dimension of mono and few
layers of MoS2, which dramatically limits their device
applications.23 In addition, residual solvents
cannot be completely removed from the surface of sheets, which causes
unwanted electrical properties.24 Chemical/hydrothermal
synthesis methods are associated with toxicity and high material consumption,
and CVD techniques result in high cost and time-consuming growth of
layers.14,19,21 Therefore,
efforts are underway to develop current methods or introduce new efficient
techniques that promise a controlled preparation of MoS2 few layers (in terms of size and thickness). Among all novel suggested
techniques to yield mono and few layers of MoS2, the layer-by-layer
thinning process has attracted particular interest because of its
significant control on reducing the thickness of flakes while their
lateral sizes are kept nearly unchanged. So far, various MoS2-based layer-by-layer thinning approaches have been reported in the
literature such as physical plasma etching,25,26 laser thinning,27 thermal annealing thinning,28 electrochemical thinning,29 and dry chemical plasma etching.30,31 Physical plasma etching takes advantage of high-energy heavy ion
bombardment (Ar+ or O–) to atomically
remove the layers.32 An increase in surface
roughness and severe physical damages to the thinned flakes are some
drawbacks of this method.25,32 Laser thinning is able
to yield only monolayers of MoS2, whose resolution is restricted
by optical diffraction limitation.33 In
other side, thermal annealing thinning (in O2, Ar, or steam
vapor atmospheres) requires a high operating temperature (250–650
°C) and long processing time.28,34 In a different
approach, electrochemical etching is used to eliminate the unwanted
top layers in an aqueous electrolyte via a three-electrode electrochemical
system.29 Based on it, an initial flake
is thinned through electrochemical reactions between the flake surface
and an ionic solution across a conductive working electrode. Introduction
of impurities and the need for an extra transfer step (from working
electrodes to electronic devices) are disadvantages of this technique.29 Unlike the mentioned methods, dry chemical plasma
etching (SF6, XeF2, and CF4) has
gained particular interest because of promising selective and soft
layer thinning.30,35−37 Most of the
previous works have focused on one reactive gas to etch MoS2 layers that result in a nonlinear etching rate with introducing
unwanted surface compounds to the remained layers. To overcome the
current problems, a sequential dry etching process with a combination
of H2, O2, and SF6 gases is hereby
proposed as a great solution to uniformly etch thick MoS2 flakes in a controlled and reliable method without increasing surface
roughness or considerable change in the lateral dimensions. In addition,
most of the previous reports have studied thinning of one flake but
is here presented for a set of flakes with different thicknesses,
which is much more practical and associated with the easier fabrication
process.

In this technique, MoS2 flakes are moderately
exfoliated
with a low-power sonication in dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent and
drop-cast onto the prepatterned Cr electrodes (Figures S1–S3), followed by two cycles of plasma irradiation
(subcycle 1: H2: 200 sccm, 200 W, and 30 s, and subcycle
2: O2/SF6 200:50 sccm, 200 W, and 15 s) to the
samples in order to etch bulk deposited flakes. Atomic force microscopy
(AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses
are employed to evaluate the controlled layer-by-layer etching. In
addition, a thinned MoS2-based photodetector is fabricated
via our proposed technique, and corresponding photoresponsivity is
investigated under different wavelengths and optical power illuminations.
In detail, a photoresponsivity of ∼1.39 A/W is achieved under
532 nm laser irradiation at 0.5 V bias voltage at room temperature
in air, while very poor optical response is observed for the device
prior to plasma etching process.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Effect of H2, O2, and
H2/O2 Plasma Etching Treatment
In order
to obtain plenty of thick MoS2 flakes, a few droplets of
MoS2 dispersion is drop-cast on Si substrates and air-dried
at 70 °C for 24 h. A number of flakes are inspected using SEM
imaging prior to any plasma treatment. To evaluate the impact of H2, O2, and H2/O2 plasma bombardment
on the MoS2 flakes, samples are placed in a reactive-ion
etching (RIE) chamber. According to it, the samples are initially
exposed to the given plasma at 200 W plasma power for 5 min at room
temperature. The field emission SEM (FE-SEM) images of some selected
as-prepared flakes are shown in part i of Figure 1a–c. After a 5 min exposure to H2 plasma at a flow rate of 200 sccm (part ii of Figure 1a), the flakes do not bear
any trace of exfoliation. To ensure, the H2 plasma is exposed
to the flakes for a further 5 min, which results in no etching. It
seems that the H2 plasma does not have the potential to
thin the MoS2 flakes. Figure 1b shows the FE-SEM image of a MoS2 flake before and after O2 plasma etching. The bombardment
is performed at a plasma power of 200 W for two individual 5 min at
a flow rate of 200 sccm. According to part ii of Figure 1b, after 5 min of O2 plasma exposures, the flakes are partially exfoliated in some regions,
but it is observed that plasma thinning is done slowly and nonuniformly.
The O2 plasma etching is done for another 5 min, which
results in further etching of the flakes, however, in an anisotropic
profile (part iii, Figure 1b). It is worth noting that a process with uniform thinning
and a reasonable etching rate is desirable while oxygen and hydrogen
plasma do not show this capability.

plasma sequence (subcycle 1: H2 200 sccm, 200 W, and 30

plasma sequence (subcycle 1: H2 200 sccm, 200, W, and 30
s; subcycle 2: O2 200 sccm, 200 W, and 30 s).

To further study the effect of O2 and H2 plasma
on flakes, the ability of sequential H2/O2 plasma
cycle in removing the MoS2 layers is evaluated. Plasma
etching process is done in a 20-cycle sequence where gases are fed
into the chamber in two separate subcycles. At the first subcycle,
a 200 sccm H2 gas is introduced into the chamber and samples
are exposed to H2 plasma at 200 W power for 30 s. At the
second subcycle, a 200 sccm O2 gas is fed into the chamber
and plasma at 200 W power is applied to the samples for 30 s. According
to the FE-SEM images, flakes are not thinned at the end of the 20-cycle
sequence process. To ensure that the flakes are not etched, the process
continues for another 20 cycles. Part iii of Figure 1c presents the SEM image of the MoS2 flake after a 40-step H2/O2 plasma treatment,
through which any trace of thinning can be observed. This result shows
that H2 plasma tends to passivate the upper layer of the
MoS2 flakes, while O2 plasma etching is physically
dominated. In other words, hydrogen ions interact with sulfur vacancies
or edge sites and prevent them from reacting with oxygen radicals.38 This fact helps us to develop an effective method
to thin MoS2 flakes. Moreover, to further clarify the impact
of H2/O2 plasma on flakes, simultaneous plasma
bombardment of both oxygen and hydrogen gases is investigated on the
pristine flakes. The pristine flakes are exposed to H2/O2 plasma (200 sccm:200 sccm) at 200 W power for 5 min at room
temperature. However, no evidence of layer etching is observed after
this plasma irradiation (Figure S4). It
seems that in the competition between the H2 passivation
and the physical O2 etching, the first is the winner.

2.2 Effect of SF6, H2/SF6, and O2/SF6 Plasma Etching Treatment
According to the previous section, the hydrogen plasma has a passivation
effect on MoS2 flakes, whereas oxygen plasma performs physical
etching. However, O2 plasma shows poor uniformity and slow
etching rate that limit its potential to thin the initially thick
MoS2 flakes. Therefore, in order to find an efficient method,
the effect of SF6 plasma gas on MoS2 flakes
is studied. Accordingly, an SF6 plasma (200 sccm, 200 W,
2 min) is applied to the as-prepared MoS2 flake in an RIE
chamber at room temperature. During plasma irradiation, SF6 molecules decompose into highly reactive F radicals that easily
etch flakes. Figure 2a shows the MoS2 flakes before (part i) and after (part
ii) SF6 plasma treatment. It can be clearly seen that most
of the MoS2 flakes are deeply and anisotropically etched
after only 2 min of plasma exposure (part ii of Figure 2a). Therefore, in contrast to H2 and O2 plasma, SF6 plasma can aggressively
thin MoS2 flakes. It is an important point that SF6 plasma etching cannot be considered as a desirable method
because controlled isotropic plasma thinning is preferred while the
presence of active fluorine radicals results in rapid removal of the
MoS2 layers.

pristine MoS2 flakes. (ii) After 2 min of exposure to SF6 plasma at
200 W power and 200 sccm flow rate. (b) (i) Pristine MoS2 flake. (ii) After 5 min of exposure to SF6/H2 plasma (50 sccm:200 sccm) at 200 W power. (c) (i) Pristine MoS2 flake. (ii) After 5 min of exposure to SF6/O2 plasma (50 sccm:200 sccm) at 200 W power.

To slow down the etch rate of layers, the combination of
SF6, H2, and O2 plasma is investigated.
As a result, two different processes are introduced based on the SF6/O2 and SF6/H2 plasma to
evaluate their impact on MoS2 flakes. Figure 2b shows the MoS2 flake before (part i) and after SF6/H2 plasma
treatment (part ii) with no noticeable thinning. Accordingly, SF6 and H2 gases are fed into the chamber at a flow
rate of 50 and 200 sccm. The plasma power is set to 200 W and the
whole process lasts for 2 min. During plasma treatment, fluorine radicals
react with hydrogen ions to form hydrogen fluoride (HF) molecules
and leave the chamber without any impact on the MoS2 flakes.
Therefore, it is observed that the SF6/H2 plasma
irradiation does not affect the flakes. In the next study, the effect
of SF6/O2 plasma upon MoS2 flakes
is investigated. Consequently, SF6 and O2 gases
with a flow rate of 50 and 200 sccm are entered into the chamber.
The plasma power is adjusted to 200 W and the process is completed
within 5 min. Figure 2c shows the FE-SEM images of the pristine and as-bombarded MoS2 flakes. As can be seen, 5 min of plasma irradiation yields
an incomplete and nonisotropic etching. During this process, the following
reactions occur 1   2   3   4  

Therefore, the mixture of
SF6/O2 plasma not
only associates with the decrease in density of O/F free radicals
but also results in highly volatile SOF4 (a boiling point
of −49.0 °C) and MoF4 byproducts which leave
the chamber without reaction. As a result, it is observed that oxygen
and fluorine radicals play a major role in flake etching, and SF6/O2 mixture tends to be more efficient than individual
SF6 and O2 gases in thinning of MoS2 flakes.

2.3 Effect of H2/O2/SF6 and Sequential H2/O2/SF6 Plasma Etching Treatment
With regard to the results from
the two previous sections, it would be understandable that SF6 plasma has a high chemical etching potential, while O2 plasma does physical etching, and passivation treatment is
occurred by H2 plasma. In the following, the effect of
a mixture of SF6, O2, and H2 plasma
irradiations on the MoS2 flakes is investigated. Accordingly,
SF6, O2, and H2 gases are fed into
the chamber at flow rates of 50, 100, and 100 sccm. Figure 3a (part i) shows the pristine
MoS2 flake inspected by the FE-SEM system. After 5 min
of exposure to H2/O2/SF6 plasma at
a power of 200 W, it is observed that the flake thickness is unchangeable
and no evidence of etching is observed. The reason behind the fact
that this plasma mixture does not perform any etching process lies
in the following chain reactions 5   6   7   8  

Figure 3 SEM and Raman characterizations. (a) SEM
image of (i) pristine
MoS2 flake (ii) after exposure to H2/O2/SF6 plasma (200 W) for 5 min at a flow rate of 200:200:50
sccm. (b) Raman spectra of pristine and H2, H2/O2, H2/SF6, and H2/O2/SF6 plasma-exposed samples.

These related reactions result in HF and volatile byproduct gases
such as SO2F2 (a boiling point −55.4
°C) and SOF2 (a boiling point −43.8 °C)
that migrate out of the chamber and leave the flakes unaffected as
can be seen in Figure 3a, part ii. Therefore, the triple mixture of given gases does not
seem appropriate for etching of flakes, and it is observed that the
results of SF6/O2 plasma are more efficient
to introduce an effective method in order to thin the MoS2 flakes. However, this plasma irradiation ends in an anisotropic
etching profile which is in need of developing.

Raman analysis
is also used to further investigate the effect of
H2 (10 min, 200 W, and 200 sccm), H2/O2 (10 min, 200 W, and 200:200 sccm), H2/SF6 (10
min, 200 W, and 200:50 sccm), and H2/O2/SF6 (10 min, 200 W, and 200:200:50 sccm) plasma irradiations
on the bulk MoS2 flakes. Figure 3b shows the Raman spectra of the pristine
MoS2 flakes before and after plasma irradiations. For bulk
MoS2, two characteristic peaks are observed around ∼382
and ∼407 cm–1 corresponding to the E2g1 and A1g phonon modes.39 As can be seen, after
H2 plasma irradiation, no displacement occurred in the
E2g1 and A1g peak positions, indicating no exfoliation or etching. For
H2/O2 and H2/SF6 plasma
irradiations, the E2g1 peak has slightly suffered a red shift, while the A1g peak shifted to the higher wave number. The origin of such shifts
can be expressed as follows: the red shift of the E2g1 peak is due to a strain induced
by the ion interaction, while the blue shift of the A1g peak is originated from the introduction of ions or removal of sulfur
atoms in the flake surface.40 The peak
shifts are more pronounced for H2/O2/SF6 plasma irradiation because more ions interact with the surface
of the MoS2 flakes. However, no evidence of flake exfoliation
is observed in all samples.

In order to uniformly remove the
layers, a method is established
based on the two-subcycle plasma process including SF6/O2 etching and H2 passivation subcycles. According
to this method, in the first subcycle, oxygen and fluorine radicals
etch the MoS2 layers, and in the second subcycle, hydrogen
ions passivate the sulfur vacancies. The role of the second subcycle
is critical because it promises an isotropic etching profile. Figure 4a–c shows
three different conditions of the applied plasma to the MoS2 flakes. In all the three exposures, plasma power is set to 200 W
and SF6, O2, and H2 gases are fed
into the chamber at flow rates of 50, 200, and 200 sccm, respectively.
The only difference between them lies in the operating time of the
etching subcycle. Figure 4a indicates the SEM images of the pristine (part i) and plasma-exposed
MoS2 flakes under the plasma condition of 20 sequential
cycles with 30 s etching and 30 s passivation subcycles (part ii).
As shown in part ii, the flake is not properly thinned and etching
is partially done on the MoS2 surface. This nonuniformity
may be originated from the long-time etching process compared to the
corresponding passivation subcycle. To challenge it, the plasma exposing
time is adjusted to 60 and 5 s for the etching step to see its impact
on the final etching profile. By fixing the etching time to 60 s,
the flake is dramatically etched in an anisotropic profile (part ii
of Figure 4b), maybe
due to the dominant chemical etching step. Moreover, by shortening
the etching time to 5 s, evidence of etching is negligible (part ii
of Figure 4c). These
results highlight the key role of the etching subcycle and especially
its time processing in the final etching profile of the MoS2 flakes.

Figure 4 SEM characterizations. SEM image of (a) (i) pristine MoS2 flake (ii) after exposure to 20 sequential cycles. First subcycle
of H2 plasma at 200 W power for 30 s at a flow rate of
200 sccm. Second subcycle: O2/SF6 plasma (200
W) for 30 s at a flow rate of 200:50 sccm. (b) (i) Pristine MoS2 flake (ii) after exposure to 20 sequential cycles. First
subcycle of H2 plasma at 200 W power for 30 s at a flow

(200 W) for 60 s at a flow rate of 200:50 sccm. (c) (i) Pristine MoS2 flake (ii) after exposure to 20 sequential cycles. First
subcycle of H2 plasma at 200 W power for 30 s at a flow
rate of 200 sccm. Second subcycle of O2/SF6 plasma
(200 W) for 5 s at a flow rate of 200:50 sccm.

Considering the importance of the etching subcycle, the best etching
time is observed to be 15 s, which provides the possibility of thinning
the MoS2 flakes to mono and few layers in a large lateral
size. Figure 4 presents
the results of 30 s passivation and 15 s etching steps for a pristine
MoS2 flake. As can be seen, after 20 sequential plasma
irradiations, mono and few MoS2 layers are obtained. The
initial thickness of the pristine flake is about 157 nm (Figure 5a), which decreases
to few nanometers after exposing to plasma. It is observed that each
sequential plasma process (including two subcycles) can remove approximately
9–10 layers of the bulk MoS2 flakes because the
MoS2 monolayer possesses a thickness of ∼0.7 to
0.8 nm.39 Based on Figure 5b, a large fraction of the flake area is
thinned into the monolayer, along with bi-, tri-, and few layers that
can be due to the variation of the initial thickness of the pristine
flake and also their orientation to plasma irradiation. Figure 5c shows the thickness measured
by AFM, which is depicted on the SEM image in part (b), where different
thicknesses are distinguished by color. The height profile of the
dash arrow is also shown in Figure 5d. Figure 5e exhibits the differential reflectance spectra of the MoS2 flakes with a thickness of 1, 2, and more than 20 layers.
The differential reflectance spectrum of MoS2 has two narrow
peaks about ∼1.87 eV (A exciton) and ∼2.04 eV (B exciton)
relating to the direct transitions at the K point.41 The spectrum also reveals a wide peak about
∼2.82 eV originating from singularities around the Γ
point of the valence band. The A and C peaks demonstrate a strong
thickness dependence, while the B exciton does not have any dependency.
Accordingly, by the increase of MoS2 thickness, a red shift
is observed in the spectra, which can be utilized to estimate the
number of layers.41

To further evaluate our technique, AFM and Raman
analyses are conducted
for the whole sample surface containing more flakes before and after
plasma exposing. Based on the AFM measurement, the initial thickness
of the selected flake is about 200 nm corresponding to ∼250
layers of MoS2 (Figure 6a). Our method has an etch rate of ∼10 layers
per two cyclic plasma, and as a result, 20 sequential plasma irradiations
are required to decrease the thickness to ∼4 nm corresponding
to approximately five layers of MoS2. The corresponding
height profile of the flakes is presented at the bottom of Figure 6a,b. The thickness
of the other flakes is also decreased dramatically. Moreover, Raman
spectroscopy of the MoS2 sample is performed before and
after the plasma thinning process (Figure 6c). To measure the spectrum, it was tried
to focus the laser beam to a fixed position in the samples before
and after plasma exposing. According to it, a bulk MoS2 sample indicates two characteristic peaks known as in-plane (E2g1) and out-plane
(A1g) vibrational modes at ∼382 and ∼407
cm–1, respectively. After plasma irradiations, the
corresponding Raman peaks are shifted to ∼385 and ∼405
cm–1 referring to successful thinning of the pristine
bulk sample to few layered MoS2.39

height profile is shown at the bottom. (c) Raman spectroscopy of the
pristine and plasma-thinned MoS2 samples.

To better analyze our introduced method, TEM and XPS measurements
are carried out for pristine and plasma-assisted thinned MoS2 flakes. The TEM image of the thinned MoS2 flake is presented
in Figure 7a with a
higher magnified image shown in Figure 7b. The TEM images exhibit electron transparent layers
implying the high-level exfoliation of bulk flakes. Moreover, no evidence
of porosity or damage to the MoS2 sheets is inspected in
the TEM images as a result of plasma exposure process, indicating
the clean/well thinning of flakes. In addition, the selected area
electron diffraction (SAED) pattern reveals the hexagonal symmetry
of the thinned flakes, which supports the high degree of crystallinity
for the thinned 2H MoS2 sheets (Figure 7c). The XPS spectra of the pristine and thinned
MoS2 flakes are also shown in Figure 7d–g. For both MoS2 structures,
the characteristic peaks of S 2p3/2, S 2p1/2, S 2s, Mo4+ 3d3/2, Mo4+ 3d5/2, and O 1s are observed at 162.7, 164.0, 225.3, 229.0, 232.1,
and 529.6 eV, respectively.39 Furthermore,
additional peaks are found in the thinned MoS2 flakes as
follows: 165.2, 235.0, 529.1, and 685.3 eV peaks that are associated
with oxidation of sulfur, damage to the Mo–S bonding, S–O
bonding, and fluorine incorporation in the remaining MoS2 surface, respectively.25,36 The atomic percentage
of S, Mo, and O atoms is measured to be 53.4, 31.0, and 15.6% in the
pristine MoS2, while it changes to 51.4, 30.2, and 14.7%
for thinned flakes, respectively. Although the atomic percentage of
oxygen is expected to experience an increase because of the presence
of S–O bonding, the partially fluorinated surface of MoS2 slightly decreases the possibility of formation of oxygen
bonding in the plasma-treated MoS2 flakes. As a result,
an atomic percentage of 3.7% is calculated for F atoms originating
from SF6 plasma irradiation and fluorine bonding with Mo
atoms.

and thinned MoS2 flakes.

Table 1 provides
a summary of all the plasma processes applied to the pristine MoS2 flakes, as well as the results of plasma exposure and their
mechanism. According to the obtained data, it is observed that the
H2 plasma passivates the sulfur vacancies on MoS2 surface. Moreover, hydrogen ions can react with fluorine radicals
to form HF molecules and leave MoS2 flakes unaffected.
O2 plasma performs etching mostly by physical bombardment
associating with anisotropic and slow etching rate, while SF6 plasma removes layers chemically with a high etch rate, however,
anisotropically. To overcome these challenges, a sequential plasma
process composed of two subcycle steps are introduced to thin MoS2 flakes to the desired thickness.

3 Thinned MoS2 Flake Photodetector
By achieving the results of three previous sections, an attempt
was made to fabricate thinned MoS2 flake (TMF)-based photodetectors.
Hence, as a first step, a 285 nm oxide is grown thermally on Si substrates
followed by deposition of 50 nm Cr using an electron beam evaporation
method. A standard photolithography technique is used to pattern the
Cr film into interdigital electrodes. Then, a few droplets of MoS2 dispersion are drop-cast on the patterned Cr/SiO2/Si samples and dried for 24 h at 70 °C (Figure S3). Figure 8a depicts the schematic illustration of the TMF photodetector
fabrication. Because of the fact that the MoS2 solution
has undergone a short bath sonication, most of the flakes are thick
and laterally large enough to electrically connect the source/drain
junctions. Hence, the deposited solution covers almost the entire
surface of the electrodes (as shown in Figure 8b). After 20 etching cycles (30 s H2 and 15 s O2/SF6 plasma irradiation at a power
of 200 W), the SEM image demonstrates thinned flakes with thickness
about few nanometers according to the AFM measurement (inset of Figure 8c). By applying the
plasma etching process, flakes considerably become thin while their
lateral sizes experienced a slight change. Because the initial thickness
of the flakes varies, during the plasma etching process, a portion
of them is removed, leaving only a fraction of the sheets with a few
nanometers in thickness. As shown in the inset of Figure 8c, the SEM image of the plasma-etched
device displays highly transparent layers with a remarkable large
lateral size. The AFM image of the device’s channel reveals
a profile height of ∼5 nm referring to six or seven layers
of MoS2 (inset of Figure 8c). In addition, Raman spectroscopy (Figure 8d) shows two characteristic
peaks at ∼384 and ∼404 cm–1, which
proves the presence of few MoS2 layers within the device’s
channel.42

exposing to 20 sequential plasma etching cycles. Inset shows higher
magnified SEM image and AFM measurement of the plasma-thinned flakes.
(d) Raman spectrum of the device channel corresponding to part c.

To fabricate a desired TMF photodetector, electrical
and optical
properties of the devices are evaluated after every five sequential
plasma cycles. Prior to plasma exposure, the thickness distribution
of the deposited flakes is counted by AFM analysis, and the electrical
property of the devices is measured at a bias voltage of 0.5 V at
room temperature (Figure 9a). It is observed that most of the devices possess electrical
currents around 100–1000 μA with very poor optical response
to laser excitation of 532 nm. After applying the plasma, at each
step, a fraction of the device current is reduced mainly because of
reduction in the flake’s thickness that results in an increase
of the device electrical resistance. At the end of 15 plasma cycles,
the devices exhibit poor optical response to laser excitation, where
one further step of plasma etching process results in significant
enhancement of the optical response of the devices. It can be deduced
that after 20 steps of plasma exposure, the thickness of the flakes
is thinned to a few nanometers, which is very well suited for investigation
of the optoelectronic properties. As shown in Figure 9c , the thickness of the flakes is mostly
decreased to the few nanometers. Any further attempts to improve the
optical response of the devices are limited by the decrease of electrical
current, as well as photoresponsivity of the devices. Finally, after
30 steps of plasma exposure, most devices turn into an open-circuit
state and can no longer be used (Figure 9b).

(b) Electrical current characterization of the devices after each
five step of sequential plasma exposure. (c) Thickness distribution
of the thinned MoS2 flakes after 20-cycle plasma irradiation

According to the obtained results, 20 plasma cycles are used in
the oncoming fabrication of the MoS2-based photodetectors. Figure 10 gives results
for the photoresponse performance of the TMF photodetector. Electrical
characterization of the device is performed in dark and under laser
illumination in air and at room temperature. A schematic illustration
of the TMF photodetector and the corresponding measurement circuit
are displayed in Figure 10a. According to energy band diagram of the bulk MoS2 and Cr contacts (Figure 10b), the electron affinity of MoS2 is ∼4.0
eV,43 and the Cr work function is equal
to ∼4.5 eV, which results in a low Schottky barrier under equilibrium
condition.44 Under laser illumination and
biasing voltage, electron/hole pairs are generated in the thinned
MoS2 and extracted from the channel43 (Figure 10c). Current–voltage characteristics (I–V) of the device are investigated in dark and under 532
nm laser illumination with 2.20 μW incident power before and
after plasma etching process. Based on it, a relatively high current
(up to 400 μA) is carried by the bulk MoS2 flake
(b-MF) at a bias voltage of 0.5 V (Figure S5). According to the resistor network model,45 each MoS2 flake has a number of stacking layers with
a finite interlayer resistance.

For flakes that are thick enough,
it is observed that the bulk
MoS2 sample shows a very poor optical response to the 532
nm laser irritation (Figure S5a), but we
believe that the thinned MoS2 sheets are more sensitive
than the bulk MoS2 slakes to the laser irradiation for
two reasons. First, in the thinned MoS2 flakes, the charge
carrier density is increased through the generation of the direct
electron–hole pairs and unlike the bulk flakes do not require
phonons. Second, an increase in the surface area of the thinned MoS2 sheets makes the separation of the electron–hole pairs
much easier under an electric field.46 In
contrast to the bulk photodetector, after the plasma etching process,
the flakes are thinned to few nanometers and optical response will
be considerably pronounced. In this case, at an operating voltage
of 0.5 V, the current increased from ∼1.50 to ∼2.00
μA under 532 nm laser excitation (part b of Figure S5). The decrease of the dark current (about 260%)
from b-MF to TMF is attributed to loss of flake’s thickness
because of plasma etching process. In the as-etched MoS2 flakes, defects (including sulfur vacancies, impurities, and surface
damages) are highly dominant because of ion bombardments. Hence, the
as-thinned flakes show poor electrical and optical characteristics
(Figure S5b). To overcome this issue, the
devices are moderately annealed at 120 °C in a vacuum chamber
(at 12 mTorr) for 30 min. After annealing treatment, electrical and
optical properties of the devices are significantly improved and a
remarkable photocurrent response (∼1.50 μA) is observed
in the TMF photodetector (Figure 10d). Figure 10e indicates the photoswitching characteristics of the TMF
photodetector at different laser excitations with the same optical
power and drain voltage. As clearly observed, the photocurrent is
considerably enhanced with the optical power. In detail, the generated
photocurrents are measured to be about 1.52, 1.21, 1.03, and 0.75
μA for 375, 405, 455, and 532 nm, respectively. Moreover, the
photoswitching properties of the device are measured at various optical
powers at a same bias voltage. As shown in Figure 10f, the photocurrent is increased from 0.2
to 2.0 μA by the increase of laser intensity from 0.14 to 36.60
μW.

The photoresponsivity of the TMF photodetector is
evaluated under
different powers and wavelength laser illuminations. The photoresponsivity
of the device was calculated based on the following equation 9  where Iph is the
photocurrent, P is the incident power, AD is the device channel area, and AL is the laser spot area. In the TMF photodetector, AD is measured to be about 4500 μm2 through SEM imaging, and laser illumination is focused at
a spot diameter of 400 μm covering almost the entire device. Figure 11a gives data of
the device photoresponsivity as a function of various laser power
illuminations (λ = 532 nm) at a 0.5 V bias voltage. It is found
that photoresponsivity decreases with the increase of incident power.
This behavior could be explained by the fact that higher incident
powers result in more generation of excitons. Thus, the recombination
rate would be increased and traps are able to capture a great deal
of electrons/holes, causing the decrease of the corresponding photoresponsivity.43,47 The photoresponsivity dependency on the power illumination is modeled
by the power law, R ∝ Pβ, where β, the fitting parameter, is equal to
−0.54. More precisely, the photoresponsivity was measured to
be 1.39 A/W at a power intensity of 0.14 μW under 532 nm laser
illumination and a bias voltage of 0.5 V, and the lowest value (R = 0.05 A/W) was obtained at an incident power of 36.60
μW.

Figure 11 (a) Photoresponsivity vs optical power characteristic of the device
under 532 nm laser excitation and a drain voltage of 0.5 V. (b) Photoresponsivity
vs laser wavelength illumination characteristic of the device at an
optical power of 2.20 μW and a drain voltage of 0.5 V. (c) Time-trace
measurement of the device at an optical power of 2.20 μW and
a drain voltage of 0.5 under laser excitation of 532 nm.

In addition, photoresponsivity versus excitation wavelengths
is
plotted in Figure 11b at a fixed power intensity of 2.20 μW and a bias voltage
of 0.5 V. Based on it, photoresponsivities of 0.65, 0.52, 0.43, and
0.32 A/W are measured for the laser wavelength of 375, 405, 455, and
532 nm, respectively. It can be seen that with the increase of the
wavelength, the photoresponsivity is clearly decreased because higher
energy photons (or lower wavelength photons) transfer more energy
to the electrons in MoS2, which gives them more chance
to overcome the traps or overpass possible barriers.48 Time-trace measurement of the fabricated TMF photodetector
is demonstrated in Figure 11c. The rise and fall times of the photodetector are measured
to be 0.45 and 1.88 s, respectively, under 532 nm laser illumination,
at an incident power of 2.20 μW and a bias voltage of 0.5 V.

Table 2 shows various
MoS2-based photodetectors in which their performances are
compared based on the laser excitation, bias voltage, photoresponsivity,
and rise/fall times. In detail, the photoresponsivity of MoS2-based photodetectors ranged from 0.40 mA/W to 1.10 A/W under 532
nm laser illumination. Compared to other previous reports, our TMF
photodetector shows a high photoresponsivity (1.39 A/W) at a low operating
voltage of 0.5 V with an acceptable response time (τrise = 0.45 s and τfall = 1.88 s), which suggests an
excellent photodetection device.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have shown that the thick MoS2 flakes
can be thinned layer by layer by a sequential plasma irradiation.
Based on it, at the first subcycle, H2 passivates the sulfur
vacancies, and at the second subcycle, O2/SF6 etches the MoS2 layers. We found that under 30 s passivation
and 15 s etching, approximately 10 layers of MoS2 are removed.
The plasma etching process is carefully investigated using SEM, AFM,
TEM, XPS, and Raman analyses. Moreover, our introduced plasma etching
method is developed to fabricate a MoS2-based photodetector
which demonstrates an excellent photoresponsivity under different
laser excitations and incident optical powers. According to it, a
photoresponsivity of 1.39 A/W and a rise time of 0.45 s are measured
at a bias voltage of 0.5 V under laser irradiation of 532 nm, which
shows the outstanding ability of our plasma thinning method in the
fabrication of MoS2-based photodetectors.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Materials
Bulk
MoS2 powders
(lateral size of 3–40 μm, 99% purity) were supplied from
Sigma-Aldrich. Figure S1 shows the SEM
image of the bulk powder. DMF solvent was purchased from Merck Company
without any purification.

5.2 Preparation of MoS2 Dispersion
Bulk MoS2 powder (0.1 g) was
mixed with 20 mL of DMF
solvent followed by gentle bath sonication for 15 min. The sonication
process was carried out in order to slightly exfoliate large thick
flakes. Then, the dispersion was kept for 1 min at room temperature
to allow adequate sedimentation of unexfoliated flakes. Finally, the
top supernatant was carefully collected to obtain the MoS2 dispersion. The obtained dispersion was shaken with hand before
drop-cast on any substrates. Figure S2 shows
the SEM image of the prepared MoS2 flakes and the corresponding
MoS2 dispersion (inset).

5.3 Device
Fabrication
Initially, 285
nm of oxide was grown on a bare clean Si substrate by dry thermal
oxidation. Then, 50 nm of Cr was deposited using an electron beam
evaporation method on the SiO2/Si substrates followed by
patterning into interdigital electrodes (line width of 8.5 μm,
line length of 100 μm, and spacing of 5.0 μm) through
standard photolithography process. At the next step, a few droplets
of MoS2 dispersion were drop-cast on the prepatterned electrodes
and air-dried at 70 °C for 24 h. A schematic illustration of
the device fabrication steps is presented in Figure S3.

5.4 Plasma Etching Process
To attain
a desired plasma etching process for thinning MoS2 flakes,
three different plasma gases, hydrogen (H2), oxygen (O2), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), are used. All
plasma processes are carried out at room temperature. The optimum
plasma etching procedure is obtained through two subcycle sequences
including O2/SF6 etching and H2 passivation
steps. During the first etching step, O2/SF6 gases (200:50 sccm, 200 W) are fed into the chamber resulting in
etching of the top layers of MoS2 flakes. After a 15 s
etching step, the O2/SF6 and byproduct gases
are vented, and H2 gas is introduced into the chamber (200
sccm, 200 W, 30 s) to passivate sulfur vacancies. The two sequences
are repeated several cycles to gradually etch flakes and achieve the
desired thinned MoS2 layers.

5.5 Characterizations
AFM imaging was
performed in a noncontact mode (a resonance frequency of 200–300
kHz) with an NT-MDT system. TEM images were recorded by a Philips,
CM30 transmission electron microscope operated at 150 kV. SEM images
were taken with an FE-SEM, Hitachi, S-4160 at an acceleration voltage
of 30 kV. Raman spectroscopy analysis (Senterra Raman, Bruker) was
done with a laser at 532 nm. XPS was employed to evaluate the surface
composition of the as-thinned MoS2 layers through Bestec
XPS system with an Al Kα source (1486.6 eV) at a pressure of
>10–7 Pa. The etching process is performed in
a
plasma etching system operating at 13.56 MHz at room temperature.
The electrical measurements were carried out with a Keithley K361
source measure unit at room temperature in ambient air.
