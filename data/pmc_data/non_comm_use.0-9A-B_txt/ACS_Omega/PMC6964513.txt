The phase behavior and related morphological evolution
of thin
films of lengthy alkyl substituted core-tetrachlorinated perylene
bisimide (C18-4ClPBI), a large π-conjugated molecule, have been
studied. It is found that the C18-4ClPBI can exist in two different
crystalline phases depending on temperature, which transform reversibly
in heating and cooling processes. The X-ray diffraction results demonstrate
that the two crystalline forms of C18-4ClPBI exhibit a similar packing
geometry but with different unit cell dimensions. It is confirmed
that the low-temperature phase is packed more compactly than its high-temperature
counterpart. During high-temperature to low-temperature crystalline
phase transition, nonbirefringent protrusions were observed, which
disassembled in the reverse crystalline phase transition process during
heating. The exact formation mechanism of the protrusions is not clear
at the moment. Nevertheless, their influence on the transfer characteristics
of the polycrystalline C18-4ClPBI thin film has been clearly illustrated.

Introduction
Organic semiconductors are an essential
part of electronic materials,
which offer fascinating prospects for many benefits, such as high
throughput, light weight, easy processing, and flexibility of the
devices.1 Perylene dyes, which consist
of two linked naphthalene units in peri position, have attracted a
great attention as organic semiconductive materials because of some
sophisticated advantages.2 Among them,
perylene tetracarboxylic acid bisimide (PBI) derivatives represent
an important role in n-type semiconductors.3−7 The comparatively great electron affinity among large-band
gap materials,8,9 outstanding photochemical property,
excellent thermal stability,10 high quantum
yields of photoluminescence,11 and strong
visible light absorption make them promising in applications including
organic field effect transistors (OFETs),12−15 organic photovoltaics,16−23 organic light-emitting diodes (OLED),24 and so on. However, their use is still limited, even though the
fundamental steps of charge transfer in combination with various donor
polymers are excellent.25,26

It is well established
that the structure and morphology of materials
in the condensed state can be different according to the processing
condition and show significant influence on their performance.27−35 Organic electronic materials are no exception, especially for the
polycrystalline thin film systems. For example, the tetrachlorinated
perylene bisimides are confirmed to exhibit excellent electron mobility
in filed effect transistors even in air.36−39 A recent study on the core-tetrachlorinated
perylene bisimides (4ClPBIs) with alkyl and fluoroalkyl substitutes
indicates that different alkyl substitutions result in different molecular
arrangement and phase behavior, which in turn influence the optoelectronic
properties greatly.40,41 Moreover, it was reported that
the electron mobility of PBI with unsymmetrical oligoethyleneglycol
substituents in the ordered liquid crystalline state can increase
by 2 orders of magnitude with respect to its amorphous state (7 ×
10–3 vs 6 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1), while the alkyl substituted
PBI in crystalline phase drops by a factor of 4 (8 × 10–6 vs 3 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1).40 Furthermore,
pulse-radiolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements
show that the N,N′-dioctadecyl-3,4,9,10-perylenebiscarboximide
has a charge carrier mobility of 0.2 cm2 V–1 s–1 in the crystalline phase, while only of 0.1
cm2 V–1 s–1 in the
liquid crystalline phase.43 This leads
to extensive studies on the properties of organic semiconductors in
different states.40−46 It should be pointed out that the diverse charge-transport properties
are actually related to multiscale structures and morphologies of
the thin films. However, the structural and morphological changes
of organic semiconductors during phase transition are rarely studied.

Herein, tetrachlorinated perylene diimide with lengthy alkyl substituent
(C18-4ClPBI),47,48 an air-stable and good-mobility
n-type organic semiconductor, was chosen to reveal the structural
and morphological evolution during heating and cooling processes.
It was found that C18-4ClPBI exhibits two different crystalline phases,
which transfer reversibly during the cooling and heating processes.
The temperature-dependent morphological evolution was monitored by
optical, scanning electron, and atomic force microscopies. The intriguing
finding of this work is the formation of some protrusions during high-temperature
to low-temperature crystalline phase transition, which show great
influence on the transfer characteristics of the C18-4ClPBI thin film
transistor. This may provide useful information for fabricating high
performance devices.

Results and Discussion
The thermal stability of C18-4ClPBI
was analyzed by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The temperature of 5% weight loss is 412.8 °C, indicating its
good thermal stability. The phase behavior of C18-4ClPBI was investigated
by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC curves of C18-4ClPBI
obtained during heating and cooling at a rate of 10 °C/min are
shown in Figure 1.
The second heating curve was used to exclude the influences of previous
thermal history on the sample. From the DSC curves shown in Figure 1, it is clear that
the C18-4ClPBI with lengthy alkyl chains (−C18H37) evidently shows two phase transitions in both the heating
and cooling processes. In the cooling process from isotropic melt
of C18-4ClPBI (Figure 1, bottom), a high-temperature transition was first appeared at 170
°C (peak temperature) and then a low-temperature transition takes
place upon further cooling to 107 °C. In the subsequent reheating
process (Figure 1,
top), the low- and high-temperature phase transitions take place at
116 and 187 °C, respectively. This demonstrates that the C18-4ClPBI
can exist in two different phases depending on temperature, which
has also been confirmed by the X-ray diffraction shown later in Figures 3 and 10. The two phases can transform from one to another reversibly
heating and cooling processes.

Figure 1 DSC cooling (bottom) and heating (top)
curves of C18-4ClPBI. The
cooling and heating rates are 10 °C/min.

It should be pointed out that the chemical structure
of C18-4ClPBI
used here is essentially the same as the N,N′-dioctadecyl-3,4,9,10-perylenebiscarboximide (C18-PBI)
reported in ref (40) except for the tetrachloro-substitutes at bay positions, see Figure 2. However, their
phase behaviors are quite different. During heating process, at least
three crystalline (transition temperatures: 111, 141, and 180 °C,
respectively) and two highly ordered liquid crystalline (transition
temperatures: 216 and 312 °C, respectively) phases were suggested
for C18-PBI.43 By contrast, only two phases
for the C18-4ClPBI were observed in both the heating and cooling processes.
This illustrates the great influence of tetrachloro-substitutes on
the phase behavior of the C18-4ClPBI. The high-temperature transition
of C18-4ClPBI starts at ca. 171 and 182 °C (onset transition
temperatures, i.e., Tonset) in the cooling
and heating processes, respectively. On the other hand, the onsets
of the low-temperature transition takes place essentially at the same
temperature in both cooling and heating process, that is, Tonset ≈ 110.7 °C. It is clear that
there exists an 11 °C undercooling of the high-temperature transition
during cooling, which is typically observed during melt crystallization.
By contrast, the occurrence of low-temperature transition at the same
temperature reflects a transformation between equilibrium states.
From this point of view, we assign the high-temperature transition
of the C18-4ClPBI in the heating process to the melting of the C18-4ClPBI
crystals (peak melting temperature Tm =
187 °C), which is very close to the crystalline to liquid crystalline
phase transition temperature of C18-PBI, namely, the crystal melting
temperature of C18-PBI. In the reverse cooling process, the high-temperature
transition is then correlated to the crystallization of the C18-4ClPBI
from isotropic melt at 170 °C (peak temperature). The low-temperature
phase transitions started at 110.7 °C in both cooling and heating
processes are then attributed to a reversible crystalline phase transition,
which resembles the crystalline phase 1 to phase 2 transition of C18-PBI.
It is reasonable because the molecular size of C18-4ClPBI obtained
by energy optimization in Materials Studio, as schematically presented
in Figure S1, is quite similar to that
of the C18-PBI.

Figure 2 Chemical structures of (a) C18-4ClPBI and (b) C18-PBI.

The X-ray diffractions of a C18-4ClPBI powder sample
taken at different
temperatures also support this conclusion. It was found that the sample
did not show any Bragg diffraction after heating up to temperatures
above 187 °C and before cooling from 200 °C down to 170
°C. Moreover, similar X-ray diffraction patterns were always
obtained at temperatures below 100 °C and above 120 °C whether
in heating or cooling process. Figure 3 shows two representative
wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns of the C18-4ClPBI powder sample
taken at 100 and 120 °C, respectively. It can be seen that the
two 2D X-ray diffraction patterns are essentially the same with a
series sharp diffraction rings, comparing Figure 3a,b. Their corresponding 1D wide-angle X-ray
scattering (WAXD) profiles (bottom part of Figure 3a,b) are also quite similar with sharp reflection
peaks, even though the d-spacing and reflection intensities
varied slightly. The appearance of sharp and intense diffraction peaks
confirms that the endothermic peaks in the DSC heating curves are
not related to the customary crystallite melting. Otherwise, reduced
reflection intensity and increased scattering of amorphous phase are
expected. The X-ray diffraction results help to conclude that the
C18-4ClPBI exhibits two crystalline forms with very similar crystal
structure. Unfortunately, the exact crystal structures of the two
crystalline forms cannot be precisely defined at moment. Therefore,
we focus here mainly on the morphological changes during the phase
transition because it is a crucial factor influencing the performance
of the materials.

of C18-4ClPBI
powder sample recorded at (a) 100 and (b) 120 °C.

Figure 4 shows the
optical micrographs of a C18-4ClPBI thin film in high-temperature
phase, which was heated to 200 °C for 5 min and then cooled quickly
down to and kept at 150 °C. The pictures were taken in situ at
different times after reaching 150 °C. It can be seen that the
crystallization of C18-4ClPBI takes place immediately after cooling
down to 150 °C, which results in the appearance of strong birefringence
of the sample, see Figure 4a. The crystallization propagates with time (Figure 4b,c) and completes within 4
min (Figure 4d). To
display the morphological evolution of the C18-4ClPBI thin film during
phase transition, the sample shown in Figure 4d was then cooled from 150 °C down to
room temperature. Figure 5 shows the optical micrographs taken during the cooling process.
One can see that the morphology remains essentially unchanged during
cooling until 110 °C, comparing Figure 5a,b with Figure 4d. When the sample was cooled down to 100
°C, that is, after low-temperature phase transition, abundant
light extinction bands appear in the optical micrograph as revealed
in Figure 5c. The light
extinction bands can be more clearly visualized in the enlarged micrograph
shown in Figure 5d.

the identical positions. (d) Magnified picture illustrating the extinction
bands.

To show the formation process of the extinction
band, in situ optical
microscopy observation of the cooling and heating processes has been
performed. Figure 6 shows the optical micrographs of a C18-4ClPBI thin film taken in
situ during the cooling and heating processes at different temperatures
under crossed polarizers. The related videos S1 and S2 can be seen in the Supporting
Information. It was found that the crystallization of C18-4ClPBI starts
when the sample was cooled from 200 °C down to 170 °C. The
crystallization of C18-4ClPBI results in the appearance of strong
birefringence of the sample, which remains unchanged until 110 °C
(Figure 6a). With further
cooling of the sample down to a temperature below the crystal–crystal
phase transition temperature, for example, 105 °C (Figure 6b), some light extinction bands
sparsely dispersed at certain places appear in the optical micrograph.
These extinction bands stop at a strip as indicated by the white arrows
in Figure 6b and develop
further with temperature. As shown in Figure 6c, some of them grow further along their
long axis as indicated by the circles, while abundant small ones are
generated between the early formed ones. At temperatures below 100
°C, the morphology does not change anymore, indicating the completion
of the crystalline phase transition. This is in good agreement with
the DSC results shown in Figure 1. In the heating process, the extinction bands do not
change until 110 °C (Figure 6d). With further heating, the extinction bands start
to disassemble. It is noticed that the later formed smaller extinction
bands disappear earlier at relative low temperature during heating
(compare Figure 6d
with 6e). All of the extinction bands disappear
completely when the sample is heated to 120 °C (Figure 6f), indicating the completion
of the reverse phase transition. This implies that the early formed
extinction bands at somewhat higher temperature are more stable than
those developed later at relative lower temperature. These in situ
optical microscopy results combined with the DSC results indicate
unambiguously that the extinction bands are caused by phase transition
rather than an annealing process.

thin film obtained
in situ during cooling from 200 °C down to 100 °C (a–c)
and the subsequent reheating heating (d–f) processes at different
temperatures as indicated. The cooling and heating rates are 10 °C/min.

It should be pointed out that periodic light extinction
under a
polarized optical microscope is quite frequently observed in ring-banded
spherulite caused by periodic twisting of the crystalline lamellae
about the lamellar axis.49−51 In the present case, the lack
of periodicity of the extinction bands roles out the possibility of
lamellar twisting-induced extinction bands. The extinction bands can
also be created by material depletion during solidification (as isotactic
polystyrene) or formation of cracks due to anisotropic thermal contraction
(as syndiotactic polypropylene).52,53 It is, however,
also not the case for C18-4ClPBI as revealed by both atomic force
microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Figure 7a shows an AFM height
image of a C18-4ClPBI thin film, which was cooled from 200 °C
to room temperature. It can be found that the bands are neither the
depletion zone nor cracks. They are actually a series of protrusions.
As seen from the height analysis, the protrusions in C18-4ClPBI thin
film are not uniform in size. They range from 200 to 1000 nm in height
and around 2 μm in the transverse direction. SEM observation
(Figure 7b,c) confirms
the AFM results. Moreover, some cracks transverse to the protrusions
are observed in the enlarged SEM picture (Figure 7b), which has not been observed in the AFM
image and may be caused by gold sputter during SEM sample preparation.

Figure 7 (a) AFM
height image with height profile and (b,c) SEM surface
morphologies of a C18-4ClPBI thin film prepared by cooling from 200
°C down to room temperature. The images were taken at room temperature.

The assembly and disassembly of the protrusions
were further studied
by in situ AFM equipped with a hot stage. Figure 8 shows the AFM height images of a C18-4ClPBI
film taken in situ during the phase transition. It can be clearly
seen that there are a series of protrusions at 100 °C (Figure 8a), which disassemble
at 130 °C (Figure 8b). The surface of the sample is not quite flat even after the disappearance
of the protrusions. Traces of the disassembled protrusions can be
identified with close inspection. Moreover, some transverse ripples
or undulations are created. After subsequent cooling of sample down
to 100 °C, the protrusions reappear mostly at the same locations
as those in the pristine sample (Figure 8c). With the help of height profiles of AFM,
the temperature dependence of the film thickness as well as the heights
of the protrusions were studied. Figure 9a shows the temperature-dependent AFM height
profiles of a C18-4ClPBI film in the same region (89 × 2.5 μm)
as that shown in Figure 9b. The sectional height profiles were got at the position marked
by white lines in Figure 9b. The silicon substrate was set as baseline (0 μm).
Five protrusions denoted by A, B, C, D, and E as well as five positions
denoted by a, b, c, d, and e were chosen to follow the height variation
of the sample during heating and cooling processes. From Figure 9b, it is clear that
the thickness of the solution cast film is not uniform. Nevertheless,
as presented in Figure 9d, the film is thicker in the high-temperature crystalline phase
than in the low-temperature one. This means that the molecular packing
in low-temperature crystalline phase is more compact than in high-temperature
crystalline phase. As a result, shrinkage of the thin film happens
during phase transition as illustrated by Figure 9d. This has further been confirmed by in
situ X-ray diffraction experiment of the thin film.

μm × 90 μm) of a C18-4ClPBI
film obtained in heating (a,b) and cooling (c) processes at different
temperatures as indicated.

AFM height images of the C18-4ClPBI thin film taken at 100 and 120

thickness (d) at the positions marked in the part a.

Figure 10 shows the reflective X-ray diffraction
profiles of
a C18-4ClPBI thin film recorded at different temperatures during heating.
It can be seen that sharp reflection peaks of the C18-4ClPBI film
are observed at the measurement temperatures. For the diffraction
profile taken at 105 °C, only reflection peaks with ratios of
1:1/2:1/3:1/4:1/5 for the d-spacings are observed,
indicating the existence of only low-temperature crystalline phase
and fixed crystal orientation in film normal direction. With further
increase of the temperature to 110 °C, besides the already existing
reflections of the low-temperature crystalline phase, diffraction
peaks with weak intensity and slightly enlarged d-spacings but the same 1:1/2:1/3:1/4:1/5 ratios can be recognized,
reflecting the beginning of crystalline phase transition. The later
appeared reflection peaks get stronger while those observed already
at 105 °C get weaker with temperature. When the temperature reaches
120 °C, only the reflections with enlarged d-spacings corresponding to the high-temperature crystalline form
are observed. This demonstrates the completion of the phase transformation.
Considering that only lattice planes parallel to the film surface
contribute to Bragg diffractions in the reflection mode, the smaller d-spacings of the low-temperature phase indicates the more
compact packing of the molecules, which leads to the shrinkage of
the sample in the film thickness direction. Taking this into account,
one may simply attribute the protrusions to the non-transformed regions
of the high-temperature crystalline phase. If this is true, the light
extinction in these regions is then hard to be understood. Moreover,
the protrusions developed during phase transition are averagely thicker
than the original film of the high-temperature crystalline phase (compare Figure 9c,d). This indicates
that the protrusions are further developed during phase transition.
Even though the exact formation mechanism of the protrusions is not
clear. They are unambiguously generated by the accumulation of molecules
excluded out of the unit cell of the low-temperature crystalline phase
during transition.

Figure 10 X-ray diffractions of a C18-4ClPBI thin film taken at
different
temperatures in reflective mode.

The above structure and morphology studies indicate
that the C18-4ClPBI
exhibits two different crystalline forms, which can transform reversibly
during cooling and heating processes. The high-temperature to low-temperature
crystalline phase transition results in the formation of some protrusions.
As mentioned in the introduction part, the performance of organoelectronic
materials depends strongly on their structures and morphologies in
condensed states. Therefore, whatever the formation mechanism is,
the protrusions may exhibit great influence on the performance of
the thin film. To show the impact of the protrusions on the optoelectronic
property, transfer characteristics of the C18-4ClPBI thin film has
preliminary been studied. To this end, as shown in Figure S2, an OFET based on C18-4ClPBI thin film was fabricated
with a bottom-contact/bottom-gate architecture (BC/BG) using a Si/SiO2 substrate containing source and drain electrodes. The transfer
characteristics of the polycrystalline film transistor were measured
at different temperatures. The representative current–voltage
characteristics measured at 100 and 120 °C are also presented
in Figure S2. It was found that the best
electron mobility of C18-4ClPBI is 1.51 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1 at 120
°C. An average value of 1.32 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1 is obtained using
three devices at 120 °C. By contrast, for the same devices measured
in situ at 100 °C, a maximum electron mobility of ca. 2.67 ×
10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1 and average of 1.77 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1 are obtained
using three devices. Actually, a higher electron mobility of the film
in more compactly packed low-temperature phase is expected. Therefore,
the higher electron mobility of the thin film in loosely packed high-temperature
phase reveals the great influence of the protrusions on the property
of the C18-4ClPBI. Therefore, techniques for avoiding the formation
of the protrusions and producing thin films with uniformly aligned
C18-4ClPBI molecules in crystalline phase is highly expected.

Conclusions
The phase behavior as well as related morphology
and structure
evolution of lengthy alkyl substituted core-tetrachlorinated perylene
bisimide (C18-4ClPBI), an air-stable n-type organic semiconductor,
have been studied. It was found that the C18-4ClPBI exhibits two crystalline
phases depending on temperature. The DSC results show that the high-temperature
crystalline phase melts at 187 °C during heating and crystallizes
again at 170 °C during cooling from the isotropic melt. Reversible
crystalline to crystalline phase transition starts at 110.7 °C
in both heating and cooling processes. The X-ray diffraction results
demonstrate that the two C18-4ClPBI crystalline phases exhibit essentially
the same packing geometry. However, the low temperature form packs
more compactly than its high-temperature counterpart does.

Morphological
evolution during phase transition was followed via
optical, scanning electron, and atomic force microscopies. The most
intriguing finding of this study is the formation of protrusions during
high-temperature to low-temperature crystalline phase transition,
which are nonbirefringent and can be disassembled in the reverse low-temperature
to high-temperature crystalline phase transition.

It is further
established that the protrusions exhibit great influence
on the transfer characteristic of the C18-4ClPBI thin film. The electron
mobility of the C18-4ClPBI thin film in high-temperature phase, 1.51
× 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1, is about 1 order of magnitude higher than
that in the low-temperature phase, ca. 2.67 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1. This
clearly demonstrates the great impact of morphology on the performance
of the materials.

Experimental Section
Materials
C18-4ClPBI was obtained on the basis of previous
report.47,48 Solvents were purchased from commercial
suppliers.

Thin Film Preparation
The C18-4ClPBI sample was dissolved
in chloroform solvent with a concentration of 10 mg/mL. C18-4ClPBI
thin films with thickness of ca. 1.25 μm (as measured by Dektak
XT) were prepared by solution casting the solution onto silicon substrate
after the evaporation of the solvent. The heat-treatment of the samples
were conducted with a Linkam LTS 350 hot stage under nitrogen atmosphere.

Characterization
Heating and cooling DSC curves were
recorded on a TA Q2000 differential scanning calorimeter at a cooling
or heating rate of 10 °C/min in the nitrogen atmosphere. TGA
was performed on a METTLER TOLEDO TGA/DSC 1/1100SF instrument. The
thermal stability of this sample was confirmed by measuring the weight
loss in the heating process with a rate of 10 °C/min from 30
to 800 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The optical micrographs
were attained by an Axioskop 40A Pol optical microscope (Carl Zeiss)
under crossed polarizers. SEM micrographs were recorded with a JEOL
JSM 6300 F. The sample surface was sputtered by gold to enhance the
contrast. The morphological evolution of C18-4ClPBI was observed in
situ by an Agilent Technologies 5500 atomic force microscope (Agilent
Technologies Co. Ltd., U.S.) equipped with a hot stage. The 2D wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (WXRD) for powder sample was completed in a Xenocs-SAXS/WAXS
system by X-ray wavelength of 1.5418 Å. The WXRD for the thin
film sample was carried out using a Philips X’pert MRD diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation, and the sample was placed on a hot place
to investigate the phase transition behavior of C18-4ClPBI film in
the heating process. The θ/2θ scans were performed in
the reflection mode with a 2θ increment of 0.05° and an
integration time of 20 s.
