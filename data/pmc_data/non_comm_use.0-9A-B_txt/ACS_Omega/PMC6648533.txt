In this study, polyamide
6 (PA) is blended with ethylene vinyl
alcohol (EVOH) to yield packaging materials with a balance of mechanical
and gas barrier properties. However, the formation of gel-like structures
in both polymers because of thermal degradation at high temperatures
leads to a processing challenge, particularly during thin-gauge film
extrusion. To address this challenge, nanoclays are introduced either
directly or via a masterbatch of maleic-anhydride-grafted polypropylene
to the PA/EVOH blend and time-resolved rheometry is used to study
the effect of different modes of nanoclay incorporation on the kinetics
of thermo-oxidative degradation of PA/EVOH blend and its nanocomposites.
Time-resolved rheometry measurements allow the acquisition of accurate
frequency-dependent linear viscoelastic behavior and offer insights
into the rate of degradation or gel formation kinetics and cross-link
density. The thermal degradation was studied by thermogravimetric
analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and
mass spectroscopy, allowing the prediction of the possible reactions
that take place during the rheological property measurements. The
results show that when nanoclays are incorporated directly, the oxidative
reactions occur faster. In contrast, in the masterbatch method, oxidative
degradation is hindered. The difference in the behaviors is shown
to lie in the different nanoclay distributions in the blends; in the
blends prepared by the masterbatch method, the nanoclays are dispersed
at the interface. In conclusion, the masterbatch-containing blend
nanocomposite would benefit processing and product development.

1 Introduction
Ethylene
vinyl alcohol (EVOH) copolymer is a semicrystalline material
with outstanding barrier properties against different gases and hydrocarbons,
rendering it attractive for applications in food packaging.1−5 However, the blending of two or more polymers is a popular and economical
strategy for the development of new materials with adjustable properties
depending on the polymer morphology. Thus, blends of EVOH with polyamide
6 (abbreviated as PA throughout the manuscript) could be an alternative
material that preserves the permeability while improving the mechanical
properties of the blends. On the other hand, it has been reported
that the final performance of PA/EVOH blends is highly dependent on
the ratio of the blend.1−3 Yeh et al.5 revealed that
the minimum EVOH concentration required to preserve the crystal structure
of EVOH is 20 wt % in a PA/EVOH blend. Because the crystalline regions
are responsible for the permeation of molecules above this critical
concentration (20 wt %), the oxygen permeation significantly increased.
In another study, Incarnato et al.3 revealed
that the specific interactions in the amorphous regions between amide
groups of PA and carboxyl groups of EVOH were strongest when the weight
percentage ratio was 75/25 in a PA/EVOH blend. This composition led
to a significant improvement in the rheological, morphological, and
barrier properties of the blends. Also, recently, the use of inorganic
nanoparticles in polymers is proven to be advantageous for enhancing
the mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties.6 However, the effectiveness of nanoparticle inclusion in
improving the physical properties is known to be proportional to the
distribution and dispersion of such nanoparticles within the polymer
matrices. Furthermore, in the case of immiscible blends, it has been
reported that optimized properties can be achieved when the nanoparticles
are localized at the interface between the two phases.7 That is, the localization of nanoparticles in immiscible
blends can significantly affect the blend morphology and thus the
final properties.

When nanoparticles are localized at the interface,
they can act
as a shield around the minor phase and suppress coalescence, thus
stabilizing the morphology. The stabilized morphology, in turn, can
improve the final properties as well.7−9 In our previous study,
different approaches to incorporate nanoclays into a 80/20 PA/EVOH
blend were implemented.10 It was found
that when nanoclays were loaded via the masterbatch (maleic-anhydride-grafted
polypropylene (PP-g-MA))/organically modified bentonite
(BET) method into the blend, they were found at the interface and
contributed to stabilizing the morphology by reducing the minor phase
(EVOH) size. This is in contrast to the situation where the nanoclays
were incorporated directly to the blend (PA/EVOH/BET). Furthermore,
the rheological properties of the nanocomposites prepared via the
masterbatch method were better than those of the directly processed
nanocomposites. It is worth noting that the storage modulus (G′(t)) of the neat polymers and
blends showed an increasing trend as a function of time, where the
blends showed even more significant increases over time (Figure 10
of ref (10)). This
could be an indication of the interfacial interactions between PA
and EVOH at high temperatures. It has been reported that PAs can decompose
to alkoxy radicals in an oxidative atmosphere and further cross-linking
interactions between such radicals and other reactive groups, e.g.,
amines and aldehydes, could lead to an increase in the modulus over
time.11,12 On the other hand, it has been revealed
that EVOH can undergo oxidative degradation, transforming vinyl alcohol
hydroxyl groups into carbonyl groups.10,13 Such degradation,
which affects the viscosity over time, could interfere with the rheological
response of the material because the degradation time exceeds the
relaxation time of the polymers. Frequency sweep tests are the most
common and convenient methods to study the linear rheological properties
of materials. Moreover, more information can be obtained from low-frequency
regions because it is associated with the longer relaxation time of
polymers (larger portions of the materials). For instance, if the
polymer is entangled, a longer time is required for relaxation; thus,
a rubbery (plateau) region will appear at low frequencies (Chapter
6 of ref (14)). Although
the small imposed amplitude in the tests ensures that the structure
of the materials will not be destroyed, in the case of transient polymers,
degradation occurs faster than the relaxation, resulting in changes
to the molecular structure of the materials.15−17 Thus, the linear
rheological results from frequency sweep tests may not be completely
accurate because the molecular structure of the polymers changes as
a result of degradation. Previous studies have revealed that time-resolved
rheometry can be used to isolate the effects of degradation in the
measurement of the rheological properties of such transient polymers.15−18 In a time-resolved rheometry measurement, the frequency-dependent
rheological properties of materials are obtained at various single
fixed frequencies over a reasonable time; then, the zero-time properties
are extrapolated to offset the effects of time and corresponding degradation.15−19 In addition, it has been shown that the collection of isochronal
storage moduli of PA/linear low-density polyethylene (PA/LLDPE) at
different times can be used as an indication of the degree of cross-linking
over time.15

Therefore, considering
the effects of nanoclay localization on
the structural properties of the blends and the fact that the blends
are oxidatively degradable (as in the case of polymer gelation), the
aims of the current study can be summarized as follows. The first
objective of this study is to acquire an accurate frequency-dependent
linear viscoelastic behavior of the (80/20) PA/EVOH blend, PA/EVOH/BET,
PA/EVOH/MB nanocomposites, and PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA blend
by excluding the degradation effects using time-resolved rheometry.
The second objective is to examine the effect of nanoclay incorporation
and localization on the rate and degree of degradation (cross-linking
reactions). The third objective is to carry out objectives number
1 and 2 at different temperatures (230, 240, and 250 °C) to assess
the effect of the atmospheric temperature on the viscoelastic and
cross-linking behavior of the blends. The fourth and final objective
of this study is to predict the probable cross-linking and degradation
reaction mechanisms that occur during the rheological property evaluation
using online thermal degradation by thermogravimetric analysis coupled
with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy
(hyphenated TGA–FTIR–MS). This technique enables reaction
monitoring in real time, and thus the predicted reactions can simulate
the actual processing environment.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Time Sweep Tests
To investigate the
thermal stability, time-resolved rheometry measurements were performed
on PA/EVOH (Figure 1), PA/EVOH/BET (Figure 2), PA/EVOH/MB (Figure 3), and PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA (Figure 4) at 230, 240, and 250 °C and different
single-frequency scans. Because the elastic (storage) modulus (G′) is more informative and sensitive to microstructural
changes, G′ as a function of time was plotted,
as shown in Figures 1–4.18

Figure 1 Time-resolved
rheometry results for the elastic (storage) modulus
(G′(t)) of the (80/20) PA/EVOH
blend at different frequencies at a fixed-strain amplitude of 0.5%
and temperatures of (a) 230, (b) 240, and (c) 250 °C under an
air atmosphere. The inset plots show the isochronal elastic modulus
(G′(ωt))
of the blends collected at different times (zero time, 300, 600, 1500,
2500, 6000, and 7200 s). PA, polyamide 6; EVOH, ethylene vinyl alcohol.

under an air atmosphere. PA, polyamide 6; EVOH, ethylene vinyl alcohol;

Figure 4 Time-resolved rheometry
results for the elastic (storage) modulus
(G′(t)) of the PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA blend at different frequencies at a fixed-strain amplitude

under an air atmosphere. PA, polyamide 6; EVOH, ethylene vinyl alcohol;
PP-g-MA, maleic-anhydride-grafted polypropylene.

From Figures 1 to 4, it can be seen
that G′(t) increases as a
function of time, increasing rapidly initially
and at lower frequencies and moderately increasing at later times
and higher frequencies. It must be noted that the rates are also different
at different temperatures, indicating the effect of temperature on
the elastic moduli of the blends. Previous studies have correlated
this behavior (increase in modulus over time) with the microstructural
changes resulting from thermally induced reactions, such as cross-linking
and branching.15−17 In this particular case, such reactions can occur
between alkoxy radicals and the amine groups with other carbonyl groups
from EVOH because of the thermo-oxidative degradation of species that
results in an increase in the viscosity and thus the modulus of the
blend. This suggests possible interfacial (intermolecular) reactions
between PA and EVOH in addition to the intramolecular reactions inside
PA and EVOH. It is worth mentioning that in thermo-oxidative degradation,
a balance between chain scission and cross-linking reaction determines
the extent and rate of the increase of the modulus.15 Thus, now that the thermo-oxidative nature of the blends
has been revealed, the isochronal elastic modulus, G′(ω, t = 0, 300, 600, 1500, 2500, 6000,
and 7200 s), at different frequencies can be collected at arbitrary
times to plot the modulus as a function of frequency, as in the case
of the frequency sweep tests. It has been previously discovered that
conducting conventional frequency sweep tests on such degrading materials
does not yield accurate results because the degradation time is faster
than the relaxation time of the polymers at longer times (lower frequencies).15 The results are shown in the insets of Figures 1–4. To eliminate the effect of the degradation, the
moduli at zero time are extrapolated and plotted as a function of
time. The other isochronal moduli at different times indicate the
effect of time on the cross-linking reactions by showing an increase
in the plateau modulus in the low-frequency regions of the inset plots
(as discussed later). It is also difficult to distinguish the effect
of temperature and the nanoclays on the degradation of the blends
from Figures 1 to 4. One can use the gelation time (the time corresponding
to the crossover point where G′(t) = G″(t)) to interpret
the differences over time. To determine the G′
and G″(t) crossover points
of the blends, a frequency of 0.1 rad/s was selected because a large
portion of the molecules is subjected to shearing, which is associated
with longer relaxation times. Therefore, the initial increase in the
modulus is sharper at low frequencies. Figure 5 shows the gel time (crossover point) as
a function of temperature for the blends and nanocomposites. The gel
point was attained at shorter times when temperature increased for
all samples. Figure 5 shows that, at 230 °C, the incorporation of the nanoclay retards
the reaction between PA and EVOH. However, probing the issue from
a different perspective illustrates that incorporation of nanoclays
in PA/EVOH/BET nanocomposite led to faster reactions than PA/EVOH/MB
nanocomposite but slower than PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA blend
at 230 °C. This indicates the synergistic effect of PP-g-MA/BET masterbatch on the degradation and the reaction
rates. The reaction time (indicated by “tgel” in Figure 5) follows the trend: PA/EVOH/MB > PA/EVOH/BET > PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA > PA/EVOH (at 230 °C). Therefore, the incorporation
of the nanoclay effectively controls the thermal degradation and gel
formation during melt processing at 230 °C. At 240 and 250 °C, tgel remains similar in all samples. This can
be interpreted from three perspectives: (i) increasing the temperature
increases the reaction rate, (ii) the nanocomposites show higher elasticity
compared to that of the neat blend, and (iii) nanoclay addition accelerates
the rate of cross-linking reactions during degradation. To investigate
these points, the isochronal collected moduli, G′(t), at different frequencies were plotted to construct the
frequency sweep results, as shown in Figures 6 and 7.

2.2 Effect
of Measuring Temperature
As
discussed previously, frequency sweep tests are straightforward and
widely used to analyze the microstructure of materials. However, for
transient polymers that undergo degradation reactions faster than
the experimental time, the analysis of the frequency test results
can be challenging. Therefore, the zero-time moduli were extrapolated
from the time-resolved rheology results to fabricate the frequency
sweep results via the point-to-point collection of moduli from all
single scanned frequencies. Figure 6 shows the corresponding acquired zero-time elastic
moduli (G′(t = 0)) of the
blends at different temperatures used to observe the effect of temperature
on the linear viscoelastic behavior of the blends. It is obvious from
the plots that the elastic moduli G′(ω)
in the low-frequency regions of all blends and nanocomposites is increased.
It should be noted again that the low-frequency regions are richer
in information because a larger portion of the molecule is being relaxed.
Furthermore, the formation of a plateau modulus in the low-frequency
region is an indication of entanglement or gel-like behavior, possibly
arising from reactions between the radicals within the polymers and
at the interface that leads to the creation of a copolymer at the
interface (as discussed later). It is worth mentioning that in the
case of PA/EVOH/BET nanocomposite, the increase in the low-frequency
region moduli is less significant of all studied cases. A plateau
in the modulus plot was not observed for the PA/EVOH/BET nanocomposite,
suggesting that the direct addition of a nanoclay into the blend did
not contribute to gel formation at the interface.

2.3 Effect of Nanoclay Localization on the Rate
and Degree of Reactions
Microscopy results from a previous
study (Figure 7) revealed
that nanoclays are located at the interface of PA and EVOH in the
case of PA/EVOH/MB nanocomposite.10 Thus,
the PP-g-MA (present in the masterbatch), which has
a tendency to segregate at the interface of the blend and emulsify
the morphology, would localize itself and the embedded nanoclays at
the interface. Therefore, on the one hand, the nanoclays and PP-g-MA at the interface form a core–shell structure
around the EVOH droplets where interfacial tension is reduced and
coalescence is hindered. As a result, the encapsulated EVOH droplets
can relax at longer times, causing the formation of a shoulder (plateau
modulus) at low frequencies. On the other hand, nanoclays at the interface
of the PP-g-MA shell could contribute to the reactions
occurring at the interface between radicals of PA and EVOH, thus inducing
the copolymer formation at the interface.

Therefore, it can
be said that the gel-like behavior (plateau modulus at low frequency)
of the PA/EVOH/MB and its larger values, Gω′ (PA/EVOH/MB)
> Gω′ (PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA)
> Gω′ (PA/EVOH/BET), is due to the emulsifying
effect of the PP-g-MA/BET, which hinders the coalescence
of the droplets and stabilizes the morphology. This again signifies
the synergistic effect of PP-g-MA and BET nanoclays
in the case of the PA/EVOH/MB nanocomposite. Figure 8 shows the zero-time elastic moduli G′(t = 0) of the blends at fixed
temperatures.

Figure 8 Isochronal zero-time elastic moduli G′(ωt=0) of the PA/EVOH blend,
PA/EVOH/BET nanocomposite,
PA/EVOH/MB nanocomposite, and PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA blend
collected at different times from time-resolved rheometry tests under
an air atmosphere at (a) 230, (b) 240, and (c) 250 °C. PA, polyamide
6; EVOH, ethylene vinyl alcohol; BET, organically modified montmorillonite;
MB, masterbatch; PP-g-MA, maleic-anhydride-grafted
polypropylene.

Interestingly, despite
the size reduction observed in the morphology
of PA/EVOH/BET, the zero-time elastic moduli G′(ωt=0) of the PA/EVOH/BET nanocomposites are
the lowest at low to medium frequencies.10 At this point, we must consider that the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, Figure 7) images
were taken from cryo-fractured samples where exposure to high temperatures,
as in the case of rheological measurement, was absent. Possibly, at
the beginning of exposure at zero time, the radicals can freely react
at the interface. In contrast, in the case of the PA/EVOH/BET nanoclays,
which are dispersed within the polymer matrix, a slightly longer time
is required for the reaction to occur. In other words, in PA/EVOH/BET,
at zero time, the reactions in PA/EVOH have a dominant effect in defining
the form of the elastic modulus compared with the effect of nanoclay
inclusion.

Moreover, this suggests that the reactions are also
shear-sensitive.
The existence of nanoclays can cause frictional forces between platelets
and polymer chains, inducing reactions and enhancing the moduli as
a function of time during shearing. To understand the effect of nanoclay
addition and its localization on the rate and degree of cross-linking
reactions further, the plateau modulus, GN, from the inset plots of Figures 1–4 was analyzed and used
as an indication of the degree of cross-linking (see Figure 9).

Figure 9 Plateau moduli (GN) of the PA/EVOH
blend, PA/EVOH/BET nanocomposite, PA/EVOH/MB nanocomposite, and PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA blend as a function of time at (a) 230, (b) 240, and
(c) 250 °C extracted from inset plots in Figures 1–4. PA, polyamide
6; EVOH, ethylene vinyl alcohol; BET, organically modified montmorillonite;
MB, masterbatch; PP-g-MA, maleic-anhydride-grafted
polypropylene.

The log–log plots
of the plateau modulus (GN) as a function
of time (Figure 9)
yielded a straight line for the blends
with different slopes (α) at different temperatures and nanoclay
localizations. Interestingly, the slopes are highest for PA/EVOH/BET
at higher temperatures, indicating that the localization of the nanoclay
within the PA/EVOH blend matrix accelerates the chain scission (see Section 2.4) reaction.
In contrast, when nanoclays were introduced via a masterbatch method
and localized at the interface (PA/EVOH/MB), the slopes are the lowest
at all temperatures despite the higher moduli values. From the above
findings, the two effects (the rate of reaction and degree of cross-linking)
can be differentiated. It is consistent with the theory of diffusion-controlled
reactions where the higher the viscosity, the lower the diffusion
as well as the rate of reaction would be. To demonstrate the ultimate
degree of cross-linking after 2 h (7200 s), the plateau modulus from
the ultimate isochronal storage modulus, G′(ωt=7200), was used to calculate the cross-link
density (XD) using the following equation.20 1  Here, GN is the
plateau storage modulus at 7200 s, R is the gas constant,
and T is the absolute temperature. The calculated
cross-link densities of the blends are plotted in Figure 10 as a function of temperature.

Figure 10 Calculated
cross-link densities of PA/EVOH blend, PA/EVOH/BET nanocomposite,
PA/EVOH/MB nanocomposite, and PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA blend
from the plateau moduli (GN) at 7200 s
at different temperatures. PA, polyamide 6; EVOH, ethylene vinyl alcohol;
BET, organically modified montmorillonite; MB, masterbatch; PP-g-MA, maleic-anhydride-grafted polypropylene.

Figures 9 and 10 reveal that the reactions are
temperature sensitive
and at higher temperatures, the cross-links became more significant.
Moreover, despite the faster rate observed for PA/EVOH/BET, the PA/EVOH/MB
nanocomposites showed higher cross-link densities. That is, in the
case of nanocomposites prepared via the masterbatch method, the cross-linking
reactions saturated the system at very early stages of the process.
Thus, over time, fewer and fewer active sites were available for reaction
as the viscosity increased and restricted the diffusion. Thus, the
reaction rate was slower compared to that of the PA/EVOH/BET nanocomposites.

In addition, rheokinetic approaches were used to study the isothermal
cross-linking reactions over the course of 2 h time sweep tests (see
the Supporting Information (SI)).21−23 The extent of reactions was measured using the rheological degree
of conversion β as a function of time (Figure 1S, Supporting Information, SI). Further, the rate of conversions
as a function of conversions  can also
be plotted (Figure 2S, SI). Then, the plots
were fitted using eqs 2S and 4S (SI). It
is interesting to see
that the rate of conversions reached the plateau region at lower conversions
in PA/EVOH/MB and PA/EVOH/BET at 250 °C (Figure 2Sb,c, SI). This indicates that in the systems where
nanoclays are involved, the conversions occurred in a faster rate
and reached the plateau region at earlier stages probably due to the
induction role of nanoclays in the reactions.

Moreover, considering
that PP-g-MA/BET at the
interface contributed to the reactions at the interface and the fact
that a stabilized interface has a significant effect on the moduli
of the blends, the higher cross-linking density, as well as moduli,
in the case of the PA/EVOH/MB nanocomposites can be explained. Possibly,
the amine groups in the surfactant of the clays, as well as carbonyl
groups of the anhydride can react with radicals from EVOH, meaning
that more active groups contributed to the cross-linking reactions
at the interface. On one hand, the MA group of the PP-g-MA could react with the amine end group of PA and form a copolymer.24 On the other hand, the anhydride MA group on
the polyolefins can react with the hydroxyl group of EVOH, leading
to an increase in the viscosity of EVOH caused by gelation (as demonstrated
in Section 2.4).25 Further, the degradation of the nanoclay surfactant
produces α-olefins that can also react with hydrogen atoms available
in the system, accelerating the cross-linking reactions.17 Other studies have also reported an increase
in the cross-linking densities of nanocomposites because of reactions
between organically modified nanoclays and polyacrylamide26 and polyurethane.27,28 The results
reveal the critical role of nanoclay localization and the mode of
inclusion on the rate and degree of the cross-linking reactions.

2.4 Degradation Reaction Mechanisms Studied by
Hyphenated TGA–FTIR–MS
The coupling of TGA
with FTIR and MS measurements allows the monitoring of the temperature
and time-dependent degradation or cross-linking of PA/EVOH, PA/EVOH/BET,
and PA/EVOH/MB observed during rheological property evaluation. The
details of the experiments are described in the Supporting Information
and shown in Figure 3S, SI. The FTIR spectra
of the gas molecules emitted from TGA during isothermal (at 230 and
240 °C) and ramping temperature measurements are presented in Figures 11 and 12, respectively. The corresponding mass spectra
at the beginning (ca. 5 min) and the end (ca. 118 min) of the isothermal
periods are shown in Figures 4S–6S (SI), respectively. MS spectra selected at different times during
the temperature ramp experiments are presented in Figures 7S and 8S (SI).

thermal degradation (studied
by hyphenated TGA–FTIR–MS) of PA/EVOH blend, PA/EVOH/BET
nanocomposite, PA/EVOH/MB nanocomposite, and PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA blend at isothermal temperatures of (a–d) 230 and (a′–d′)
240 °C. PA, polyamide 6; EVOH, ethylene vinyl alcohol; BET, organically
modified montmorillonite; MB, masterbatch.

Figure 12 FTIR analysis of the gas evolved during thermal degradation (studied
by hyphenated TGA–FTIR–MS) of (a) PA/EVOH blend, (b)
PA/EVOH/BET nanocomposite, (c) PA/EVOH/MB nanocomposite, and (d) PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA blend. PA, polyamide 6; EVOH, ethylene vinyl alcohol;
BET, organically modified montmorillonite; MB, masterbatch.

Figure 11a shows
that at 230 °C, carbon dioxide (CO2), secondary NH
(H-bonding of PA), amide II (NH2), and amide III (CN) bonds
are present in PA/EVOH. The bands corresponding to these groups become
more pronounced at 240 °C (Figure 11a′). This is in line with the time-resolved
rheometry results because the rate of chain scission followed by the
chain restructuring increases at 240 °C (the proposed reaction
mechanism is shown in Schemes 1–3). Because
the TGA experiments were conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere and the
MS experiments were conducted in a helium atmosphere, the CO2 may have been released from the degradation of EVOH and PA macromolecules.
In the spectrum of PA/EVOH/BET, the CO2 band is more pronounced
and secondary NH, NH2, and CN vibrations are absent (Figure 11b). The distributed
nanoclays in the PA/EVOH matrix most probably disrupt the inherent
hydrogen bonding of PA and promote the chain scission and restructuring
reactions. Consequently, the FTIR shows pronounced CO2 absorption
and the absence of secondary NH, NH2, and CN vibrations.
Such a reaction is probably responsible for the lowest G′ observed during rheological property analysis of PA/EVOH/BET
at all examined temperatures (see Figure 8). The increase in temperature enhances the
reaction kinetics and the associated molecular vibrations (Figure 11b′). As
revealed in Figure 11c,c′, the release of CO2 from PA/EVOH/MB at 230
°C was more significant than that at 240 °C. Moreover, secondary
NH, NH2, and CN vibrations are still present at this temperature.
This observation suggests that the EVOH core could undergo chain scission
and that the cross-linking of EVOH, PP-g-MA (present
in the MB), and PA begins at the interface. On the other hand, the
spectrum of PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA is similar to that of
PA/EVOH, although with stronger CO2 absorption (Figure 11d,d′). As
evidenced from the 3D tomograms (Figure 7), the BET nanoclays embedded in PP-g-MA are localized at the interface of PA and EVOH, thus
retarding the overall rates of chain scission and the restructuring
of PA and EVOH. However, at the interface, PP-g-MA
bonds with both PA and EVOH phases, thus forming cross-linked structures.
Bondon et al.29 studied the interface morphology
of PA and PP-g-MA as well as EVOH and PP-g-MA in a multilayered co-extruded film where PP-g-MA was used as a tie layer. The authors found that the
interface of EVOH/PP-g-MA is much thicker than the
interface of PA/PP-g-MA, indicating the formation
of a complex copolymer architecture. As a result, PA/EVOH/MB exhibits
a high cross-link density and hence high G′
in the low-frequency region.

Scheme 1 Scheme 2 Scheme 3 Although the reactions at isothermal
temperatures result in some
chain scission and recombination and gel formation, most degradation
occurs in the range of 416–432 °C (ca. 19.6 min), followed
by a significant step at 504–517 °C (ca. 23.9 min) (Figure 3Sc,d). Hence, the FTIR and MS spectra
during the temperature ramp are reported at 19.6, 23.9, and 27.6 min
(toward the end of the degradation). The FTIR spectra presented in
the different parts of Figure 12 confirm the presence of CH, CO2, and CO-imide
rings in all samples, and a symmetrical imide C=O vibration
appears at 1720 cm–1.30

The reaction mechanisms are proposed on the basis of the mass
fragments
identified in Figures 4S–8S. According
to Figures 4S and 5S, the pre-dominant
mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) are
40 and 44. Additionally, a mass fragment with m/z = 44 appeared to a greater extent in PA/EVOH compared
with the other samples. PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA showed the
lowest emission of this mass fragment. Therefore, mass fragment 44
probably originates from the reaction of PA and EVOH. On the other
hand, the mass fragments effused from the different samples during
temperature ramping (in particular at 23.9 min) are at m/z = 40, 44, 55, 70, 84, and 113. The hydroxyl group
of EVOH can react directly with the carboxyl end group of PA and forms
slightly cross-linked extended chains.31 Because the fragments at m/z =
40 and 44 are the dominant mass components, it is most likely that
methanol is released from EVOH, as shown in reaction mechanism Scheme 1. The intermediate
mass fragment has a mass of 40 and, after capturing hydrogen from
propane, which has m/z = 44, a peak
at m/z = 55 results from the breakdown
of the C–O bond of EVOH (reaction Scheme 2). The free OH from EVOH reacts with PA and
forms adipic acid, which eventually reduces to cyclopentane (m/z = 84), CO2 (m/z = 44), and H2O at around 285–295
°C (demonstrated in reaction Scheme 3).32 In PA/EVOH/MB,
at the interface region, PP-g-MA reacts with both
polymers, as shown in reaction Scheme 4, and forms cross-linked structures. The formation
of long chains in an intermediate step could be responsible for the
initial high cross-link densities in PA/EVOH/MB, as shown in Figure 10. At high temperatures,
this structure can eventually produce species with m/z = 55, 114, and 70 (demonstrated in reaction Scheme 4). Chain scission
of PA itself results in species with m/z = 113 (demonstrated in reaction Scheme 5). It is apparent from Figures 6S to 8S (SI) that the release of the fragment at m/z = 113 is reduced significantly in the
presence of the masterbatch. Therefore, the masterbatch can potentially
retard the degradation of PA. Concerning gel formation in neat EVOH,
the vinyl alcohol hydroxyl groups are transformed to carbonyl groups,
thus creating a double bond (shown in reaction Scheme 6).4 This may lead
to the release of species at m/z = 71 and 126. The peak at m/z =
126 is absent in all MS spectra. However, in Figure 7S, the peak at m/z = 71
is only present in the spectra of PA/EVOH/MB and PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA. Therefore, the incorporation of the nanoclay via masterbatch
can improve the thermal stability of PA/EVOH by preventing the degradation
of both PA and EVOH. Moreover, from the above discussion, it is clear
that the observed plateau behavior in the time-resolved rheometry
may be due to the cross-linking reactions, as well as polymer chain
restructuring, after a certain extent of chain scission.

3 Conclusions
The
main objective of this work was to understand the effects of
the incorporation of nanoclay particles and their localization on
the rate and degree of degradation of a PA/EVOH blend using time-resolved
rheometry and hyphenated TGA–FTIR–MS. Because all blends
show a rapid increase in G′(t) at shorter times and a moderate increase at longer times, the zero-time
moduli (G′(t = 0)) were collected
isochronally from all single-scan frequencies to manually construct
the frequency sweep results. By doing so, the effects of thermal degradation
were mitigated and more accurate frequency sweep results were obtained.
It has also been revealed that increasing the measuring temperature
increases the rate of intramolecular reactions, as well as those between
radicals of both components: PA and EVOH. It is interesting to note
that the direct addition of the nanoclay into the blend does not contribute
to cross-link formation at the interface. The cross-link formation
reaction takes place at the interfacial region of PA/EVOH/MB and thus
this specimen exhibits a high cross-link density due to the synergistic
effects of nanoclays and PP-g-MA. It was shown that
the higher modulus of the PA/EVOH/MB was due to the interactions that
both nanoclays and PP-g-MA caused at the interface
concurrently. This was proved where moduli of each PA/EVOH/BET and
PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA where lower than that of PA/EVOH/MB.

Reaction mechanisms have been proposed on the basis of the analysis
of the released mass fragments obtained from hyphenated TGA–FTIR–MS
measurements. The reaction schemes indicate that the observed plateau
behavior in the time-resolved rheometry measurements arises from the
cross-linking reaction in PA/EVOH/MB. On the other hand, polymer chain
restructuring after a certain extent of chain scission is mainly responsible
for the plateau behavior observed in the PA/EVOH and PA/EVOH/BET blends.
Therefore, if gel formation is defined as molecular restructuring
caused by thermal degradation, the incorporation of the nanoclay masterbatch
can reduce the rate of gel formation and increase the cross-link density
at the interface. It was found that the reduced gel formation can
thus decrease the die swelling of such nanocomposites. Further, on
the basis of the melt flow index (MFI) value (≈8 g, 10 min–1) of this particular blend nanocomposite (PA/EVOH/MB),
we can suggest that it would be more suitable for rigid packaging
(container) application (Figure 7 of ref (10)). However, further studies on the barrier properties
of this blend are required to confirm the link between nanoclay incorporation
and oxygen permeability.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The PA used in this study
was a commercial product (UBE1015, UBE Industries, Japan). According
to the supplier, the density of PA is 1.14 g/cm3 and it
melts between 215 and 225 °C. The measured melt flow index (MFI)
(250 °C/2.16 kg) of PA is 4.56 g/10 min. The EVOH was commercial
grade (Eval H171B, UBE Industries, Belgium) with 38 wt % ethylene
content. The measured MFI of EVOH at 230 °C/2.16 kg is 3.41 g/10
min. The nanoclay, Betsopa OM (BET), is a South African natural bentonite
modified with dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow quaternary ammonium surfactant.
According to thermogravimetric analysis, BET contains approximately
36 wt % of surfactant and it was a commercial product obtained from
CSIR, South Africa. The PP-g-MA/BET masterbatch (Polyzimo
MB) is another in-house product with inorganic nanoclay content of
around 30.8 wt %.

4.2 Sample Preparation
A twin-screw extruder
(Process 11 co-rotating, L/D = 40,
Thermo Scientific) was used to prepare the blends of PA and EVOH,
as well as the nanocomposites. More detailed specifications on the
preparation can be found in the previous work.10 The blend and the nanocomposites with BET and masterbatch
are denoted PA/EVOH, PA/EVOH/BET, and PA/EVOH/MB, respectively. A
PA/EVOH/PP-g-MA sample was also prepared and analyzed
to probe the reaction mechanism for the sake of comparison with the
systems incorporated with nanoclays. Because of the hygroscopic nature
of the polymers, the injection molded specimens were treated thermally
before the rheological property analyses and the hyphenated studies.
All specimens were dried at 80 °C for 19 h under vacuum, cooled,
and kept at around 46 °C for the span of the investigation.

4.3 Characterization Techniques
4.3.1 Rheological
Analyses
Rheological
analyses were conducted using a Physica MCR501 rheometer (Anton Paar
Austria) equipped with 25 mm parallel plates. Time-resolved rheology
measurements were carried out under an air atmosphere at a strain
amplitude of 0.5% (linear region) for 2 h. The selected frequency
for the blends were probed at different frequencies of 0.1, 0.3, 1,
3, 6.28, 10, 30, 60, and 100 rad/s to cover the low, intermediate,
and high-frequency regions. The time evolution rheological properties
of the blends were determined at 230, 240, and 250 °C.

4.3.2 Hyphenated Studies (TGA–FTIR–MS)
The
effects of the temperature and the time on the thermal degradation
and the cross-linking reaction of PA/EVOH and the blend nanocomposites
were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, PerkinElmer,
Pyris 1) coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR,
PerkinElmer, Frontier NIR), gas chromatography (GC, PerkinElmer, Clarus
680), and mass spectrometry (MS, PerkinElmer, Clarus SQ 8C). The online
measurements (without GC separation) allow the identification of all
mass fragments evolved during pyrolysis (TGA in a nitrogen environment)
of the blends and the blend nanocomposites. The gas molecules/mass
fragments evolved during TGA (isothermal at 230 and 240 °C and
temperature ramping) were transferred to the FTIR cell and, finally,
to the GCMS via a TG–IR–GCMS interface (TL 9000). The
column used to transfer the gas molecules from FTIR to MS (without
GC separation) was a SUPELCO analytical SPB-50 fused silica capillary
column (30 m long with a diameter of 250 μm). The GC oven temperature
was maintained at 280 °C throughout the experiment. The mass/charge
ratio analyzed by MS ranged from 35 to 300, and the carrier gas was
helium. The isothermal and the ramp methods are presented in Scheme 7a,b, respectively.
At the end of the experiment, the furnace was left closed to ensure
the environment was not disturbed for FTIR and MS data collection.
The sample masses used for this analysis ranged from 21 to 23 mg.
