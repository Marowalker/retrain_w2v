Micelles
play an important role in both experimental and computational studies of
the effect of lipid interactions on biological systems. The spherical
geometry and the dynamical behavior of micelles makes generating micelle
structures for use in molecular simulations challenging. An easy tool
for generating simulation-ready micelle models, covering a broad range
of lipids, is highly desirable. Here, we present a new Web server,
Micelle Maker, which can provide equilibrated micelle models as a
direct input for subsequent molecular dynamics simulations from a
broad range of lipids (currently 25 lipid types, including 24 glycolipids).
The Web server, which is available at http://www.micellemaker.net, uses error checking routines to prevent clashes during the initial
placement of the lipids and uses AMBER’s GLYCAM library for
generating minimized or equilibrated micelle models, but the resulting
structures can be used as starting points for simulations with any
force field or simulation package. Extensive validation simulations
with an overall simulation time of 12 μs using eight micelle
models where assembly information is available show that all of the
micelles remain very stable over the whole simulation time. Finally,
we discuss the advantages of Micelle Maker relative to other approaches
in the field.

Introduction
Micelles are biologically
relevant lipid complexes, typically consisting
of a polar head group and a lipid tail. In polar solvents, the lipid
tails assemble to create a hydrophobic core, with the polar head groups
building a hydrophilic water shell. Micelles play an important role
in studying membrane-bound macromolecules, where they are used as
alternatives to lipid bilayers, thus retaining the structural stability
and biological function of these macromolecules.1 However, the highly dynamic nature and spherical geometry
of the complexes makes preparing micelles for molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations challenging. We have observed that the initial micelle
models often contain clashes resulting from automatic lipid assembly,
and, furthermore, equilibration can be difficult due to severe density
changes during the heating phase when lipids in the input model assemble,
thus creating a need for a comprehensive easy-to-use tool to model
simulation-ready micelles.

Our new Web server, Micelle Maker,
is an online tool that builds
micelles from a broad range of lipids (25 lipid types currently supported),
as well as minimizing and equilibrating them as the direct input for
subsequent MD simulations. The Web service provides a user-friendly
interface with minimal input requirements (Figure 1), making it easy for the user to build a
micelle of choice. This is automatically created and placed into a
water box including salt and counter ions, followed by (optional)
user-defined postprocessing, that is, minimization or equilibration
of the micelle. The output consists of the initial model of the micelle
in a water box provided in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format, and the
corresponding topology and coordinate files. If minimization or equilibration
is
chosen, the output additionally contains all of the log files generated
by Micelle Maker, the minimized/equilibrated micelle systems in PDB
format, and the corresponding topology and coordinate files, and in
the case of equilibration, a restart file that can be used as the
direct input for MD simulations. Finally, the prepared micelle is
graphically presented in the Web browser using the NGL viewer and
can be actively assessed by the user.

and (B, C) sample sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles generated by Micelle Maker in ball-and-stick
and surface representations, respectively.

The Web server is linked to the AMBER MD package,2 the usage of which is covered by our existing
AMBER 16
license (personal communication with the AMBER developers); therefore,
no additional licensing is required for the users of our Web service.
Submitted users’ data are kept private and are not viewable
by anyone other than the user or those given permission by the user.
All of the data are deleted after 10 days.

Application
Micelle
Maker provides a user-friendly interface, with minimal
input requirements, leaving it up to the user to build a micelle according
to the preferred specifications. The input only requires selection
of a lipid type, the number of lipids, a salt type (NaCl or KCl),
the associated salt concentration, and the rewriting of a security
code to prevent misuse of the Web server. Each lipid molecule structure
is visualized next to the input mask when selected. After job submission,
a link to the results page is provided to view the results in the
Web browser. An e-mail address may be optionally provided to obtain
a link to the final results. A collection of experimentally determined
micelle characteristics is provided on a separate Web page to support
the user in selecting the appropriate parameters to build realistic
micelle structures (see also Tables S1 and S2, Supporting Information).

A typical Micelle Maker job
takes between 2 and 60 min of real
time, depending on the input parameters and the postprocessing routine
selected. Naturally, the generation of larger micelles takes more
time compared with small micelles, and a full equilibration takes
much more time than minimization, or only creating an initial micelle
model. For simplicity, the prepared micelle system is graphically
presented in the Web browser using the NGL viewer3 and can be actively assessed by the user. In this representation,
the lipid molecules are shown as sticks, and the user
is given the option to selectively show explicit representations of
lipids, water molecules, ions, and hydrogen atoms, as well as a van
der Waals surface representation of the micelle, and to select between
a black or white background theme. Finally, the viewport can be extended
to show a full-screen representation of the micelle system.

Comparison
to Other Approaches
To the best of our knowledge, the only
peer-reviewed Web server
that provides a micelle-building functionality is Micelle Builder,4 which is implemented in the CHARMM-GUI5 (http://www.charmm-gui.org). Even though both CHARMM-GUI and Micelle Maker were built with
the intention to generate micelle models, both approaches significantly
differ in their underlying methodologies as well as their output information
and cannot be considered to be similar methods. Specifically, CHARMM-GUI
currently supports 21 lipids, including SDS, several phosphocholines,
and six glycolipids in α/β configurations. For comparison,
Micelle Maker supports 25 lipids and 12 glycolipids in α/β
configurations, in addition to SDS. Whereas CHARMM-GUI uses the CHARMM
force field for lipid parameterization, Micelle Maker uses AMBER’s
GLYCAM library, the parameters for which were reported to be in good
agreement with experimental studies.6 Following
from this, as can be seen in Table S1,
we obtain a good agreement between, where experimentally available,
Rh and Rs values, which describe the hydrodynamic radius and the effective
micellar radius of the micelles, respectively.

Furthermore,
CHARMM-GUI does not contain any error-checking routines
such that the sugar head groups from glycolipids could clash, which
results in ring conjunctions that cannot be repaired even by structure
minimization. Micelle Maker prevents such clashes by having an error-checking
routine implemented, as discussed in the Micelle Generation section.
Related to this, Micelle Maker was mainly developed using glycolipids
and successfully validated using micelles based on seven glycolipids
and SDS (three independent 500 ns simulations), whereas CHARMM-GUI
micelles were successfully validated based on three phosphochinolines
and SDS (single 100 ns simulations). As already mentioned, due to
the structural dynamics of micelles, the equilibration of micelle
models can be challenging. Here, we see an additional benefit of Micelle
Maker, which not only provides steric-clash-free micelle models but
also ready equilibrated systems that can be used as direct input for
subsequent MD simulations. The advantage of CHARMM-GUI is that it
contains some more functionalities like building mixed micelles, or
the setup of protein–micelle systems; however, the latter can
also be done easily using PyMol (a free version is available as a
Linux package) with much more modeling possibilities. At present,
Micelle Maker only builds homogeneous detergent micelles, although
this might be extended in the future. Finally, the CHARMM force field
can be transferred to other software packages, whereas GLYCAM, so
far, can only be used in combination with AMBER. However, Micelle
Maker presents the first automated method to create micelles based
on GLYCAM as direct input to the AMBER software. In summary, both
approaches not only differ in the supported lipid types and preferences
but also the underlying force fields; whereas CHARMM-GUI provides
more options, Micelle Maker mainly focuses on the quality and usability
of the provided output structures, avoiding a modeler’s frustration
with error-prone models and equilibration issues.

We note here
as an aside two more tools of value when generating
micelles. The first is an extension to the MemBuilder server (MemBuilder
II, http://bioinf.modares.ac.ir/software/mb2/), which was originally developed to build lipid bilayers7 but has now also been extended to build micelles
and liposomes. The micelle generator of MemBuilder II, however, only
supports four different lipid types and allows for minimization and
not equilibration of the resulting micelle structures. Another valuable
tool is Packmol,8 which is a command line
tool to generate initial configurations for MD simulations using a
packing optimization algorithm.9 Packmol
allows for the rapid construction of good starting configurations
for micelles, with minimal scripting required. In addition, Packmol
includes routines to check steric clashes, as well as the possibility
to use custom lipids for the micelle models. Therefore, and at the
suggestion of a reviewer, we will be exploring introducing Packmol
as a backend to future versions of Micelle Maker to expand the scope
of micelles that Micelle Maker can generate.

Conclusions
Micelle Maker (http://www.micellemaker.net) is an easy-to-use online tool for generating equilibrated micelles
as direct input for MD simulations with the AMBER MD package, using
its GLYCAM library. Currently, Micelle Maker supports 25 lipid types.
These are mainly glycolipids, as well as SDS, and micelles formed
from these lipids have been shown to be stable in long-timescale validation
simulations. Micelle Maker provides the broadest range of glycolipids
for any micelle-generating software to date, is the only tool based
on the AMBER force field using GLYCAM, and is unique in its ability
to provide equilibrated systems as direct input to MD simulations.
As such, we believe it provides a valuable addition to the toolbox
of the molecular modeling and informatics communities.

Methods
Overview
The Micelle Maker workflow and sample micelles
are shown in Figure 1. The Web server is mainly intended to be used with the AMBER simulation
package and currently supports 25 lipid types, including 12 glycolipids,
each in α- and β-stereoconfigurations of the sugar head
group, based on the parameters from Abel et al.,6 using AMBER’s GLYCAM library.

The micelle
is generated by spreading points equally over a sphere and placing
lipids on the vectors defined by these points and the sphere origin,
based on the user’s input parameters. During this process,
each lipid molecule undergoes a random translation and orientation
and is checked for clashes with the surrounding lipid molecules (see
the next section). The input mask provides default values for the
salt concentration and the lipid distance, which are 0.15 mol L–1 and 4 Å, respectively. Our in-house validation
studies (Table S1, Supporting Information) have shown that a 4 Å lipid distance is optimal for generating
stable and realistic micelle models, taking into account also the
radius of gyration (ROG, Figure 2) and the solvent accessible surface area (SASA, Figure 3) of the resulting
micelles. The number of lipids that can be used is limited to a range
between 20 and 150, thus covering the experimentally determined aggregation
states of the lipids provided. After job submission, the micelle of
choice is automatically created and placed into a water box including
salt and counter ions, followed by (optional) user-defined postprocessing,
which can be either minimization or equilibration of the micelle.

Micelle Generation
The initial micelle geometry is
generated using a representation of evenly distributed points on a
sphere, using the spiral point algorithm developed by Rakhmanov, Saff,
and Zhou,10,11 with the “golden sphere” modification.12,13 The sphere size is determined by a user-defined interlipid distance,
that is, the distance between the points on the sphere and the number
of lipids (points). Information about the chemical structure of the
different lipids is stored in a database as part of the program, and
this information is then used to generate lipid molecules, which are
then aligned onto vectors defined by the sphere’s origin, and
the points spread over the sphere’s surface, using their hydrophobic
tails. The micelle-generation process includes three steps of randomization:
(1) The sphere is randomly rotated to always provide a different localization
of points in Cartesian space. (2) Each lipid molecule undergoes a
random rotation before being aligned onto a vector. (3) Each lipid
undergoes a random translation on its vector, within a 2 Å distance.
Steric clashes between the lipids are avoided by use of an error-checking
routine, which calculates the root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) between
each of the lipids and its surrounding atoms and introduces a new
lipid placement if an atom is found within a rmsd of 2.5 Å from
the lipid. These steps lead to a unique micelle that is free of steric
clashes, thus providing a good starting point as an input structure
for subsequent simulation purposes; once the micelle has been generated,
it can be used for any kind of simulation the user is interested in.

Lipid Types Available in Micelle Maker
Micelle Maker
currently supports 25 lipid types, including 12 glycolipids each in
α- and β-stereoconfigurations of the sugar head group
(Table 1). The lipids are modeled based on the parameters from
Abel et al.,6 using AMBER’s GLYCAM
library.2 Most importantly, Micelle Maker
supports two key lipids frequently used in experimental studies, namely,
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and n-dodecyl-α/β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM).14−17 Further information about the lipid types available
can be found in Tables S1 and S2. The micelles
created using these force field parameters were reported to be in
good agreement with the experimental studies.6 The Micelle Maker Web page provides a collection of experimentally
determined micelle characteristics to support the user in selecting
appropriate input parameters to build realistic micelle structures,
and, for convenience, these are also presented in Tables S2, Supporting Information. These characteristics include
the aggregation number, critical micelle concentration, and the solvent
composition. We note that the experimental data are only provided
for lipid types for which, to the best of our knowledge, reference
literature exists.

Minimization and Equilibration
of the Micelles
All
of the MD simulations used in the micelle preparation are performed
using the AMBER 16 simulation package,2 covered by the AMBER license (personal communication with the AMBER
developers). This involves initial user-optional minimization and
equilibration of the micelle in an explicit solvent. All of the model
systems are generated with the LEaP module of AMBER 16. The initial
model is placed in an octahedral water box, formed of TIP3P water
molecules,18 extending to at least 11 Å
from the solute in each direction. The systems are neutralized as
relevant using either Na+, K+, or Cl– counter ions, and this can then be extended to a user-defined ionic
strength using either NaCl or KCl.

If the user chooses to only
minimize the micelle, the solvated micelles are subjected to a three-step
minimization procedure to remove steric clashes between the water
molecules and the solute, as well as between the solute molecules
themselves. This minimization procedure is comprised of (1) 10 000
steps of steepest descent followed by 10 000 steps of conjugate
gradient minimization, (2) subsequent 5000 steps of steepest descent
and 2000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization using 25 kcal mol–1 Å–2 harmonic positional restraints
on all of the solute atoms, and, finally, (3) 5000 steps of steepest
descent and 2000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization with weaker
5 kcal mol–1 Å–2 harmonic
positional restraints on all of the solute atoms.

If the user
chooses to equilibrate the system, an initial minimization
using 5000 steps of steepest descent and 2000 steps of conjugate gradiant
minimization with a weaker 24 kcal mol–1 Å–2 positional restraint on all of the solute atoms,
followed by 17 subsequent equilibration steps: (1) A 50 ps NVT simulation
to increase the thermostatic target temperature using the Berendsen
thermostat and pressure control algorithms,19 with 0.5 ps time constants for both the bath coupling and the pressure
relaxation. (2–4) Three 50 ps NPT simulations at a constant
isotropic pressure of 1 atm to adjust the density of the system to
1 g cm–3. (5–16) Twelve 100 ps NVT simulations
during which time the 24 kcal mol–1 Å–2 positional restraints are progressively decreased to 0 in 2 kcal
mol–1 Å–2 increments. Finally,
(17) a 1 ns NVT simulation without any restraints on the system. All
of the 17 steps together result in a total equilibration time of 1.5
ns, during which time the target thermostat temperature is increased
from 100 to 300 K and kept constant at 300 K using Berendsen’s
weak coupling algorithm.20 All of the bonds
involving hydrogen atoms are constrained using the SHAKE algorithm,21 and short-range, nonbonded interactions are
calculated subject to an 8 Å cutoff radius. The corresponding
long-range interactions are described using the particle mesh Ewald
method.22 All of the simulations are performed
using a 2 fs time step throughout.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
of the Micelle Models
Our micelle models were validated based
on eight different micelles
(Table S1, Supporting Information, see
also Figures 2–4) created by Micelle Maker, where experimentally
determined information about the number of lipids per micelle is available
(see Table S2). To validate our micelle
models, we performed substantially longer production simulations using
three independent equilibrations to obtain three independent starting
points for each micelle simulation. All of the validation simulations
were performed using a 2 fs time step, saving snapshots every 20 ps,
and with the same simulation setup as described in the previous section.
All of the production simulations were performed using NVT conditions,
and subsequent analysis of the MD trajectories was performed using
CPPTRAJ.23 All of the validation data shown
in this paper are obtained as averages over the last 500 ns of three
independent equilibration runs for each system (i.e., a total of 1.5
μs simulation time per system). The radius of gyration (ROG)
and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) plots, shown in Figures 2 and 3, demonstrate that all of the systems remained stable over
this simulation time. In addition, we note that micelles are not completely
spherical, but rather form ellipsoids, the shape of which can be investigated
by calculating the eccentricity (defined as 1 – (Imin/Iavg),24 where I is the principle moment of inertia
of the micelle). As can be seen from Figure 4, the highest eccentricity values were obtained
for the glycoside micelles, namely nonyl-β-d-glucopyranoside
(β-NG) and octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (β-OG),
respectively. These are also the only micelles that were reported
to form a prolate shape.25 However, a more
recent study has suggested an oblate shape,26 whereas another study reports a shape that fluctuates between prolate
and oblate.27 Our molecular dynamics of
the maltoside micelles, namely β-OM, β-DM, and β-NG,
are in line with the reports that these micelles form an oblate shape.26 The lowest eccentricity value was obtained for
α-DDM, which is in line with the observations from Abel et al.
that glycolipids based on α-monomers form more spherical micelles
when compared with their β-monomeric counterparts.6 Finally, our eccentricity values for SDS also
suggest an ellipsoidal shape for this micelle.

Figure 4 Plots of the eccentricity
of different micelles over 500 ns of
molecular dynamics simulation time (calculated as described in the
caption to Table S1). Numbers denote the
number of lipid molecules of a micelle. All of the values are shown
here as averages over three independent MD simulations (solid line),
with the standard deviations over each frame of the three trajectories
shown as the shaded background to each average value. For definitions
of the lipid abbreviations used, see Table 1.

Micelle Maker Implementation
Micelle Maker has been
implemented in Python (version 3.4.5) (Python Software Foundation),
similarly to the subroutines to create the input files for AMBER2 using the LEaP module from AMBERTools.2 Up to six serial and two GPU-accelerated jobs
can be run in parallel based on our current Web server resources.
Run times depend on the configuration of the micelle model, with the
lipid type and the number of lipids being the crucial factors determining
the run time. These vary between 2 and 20 min for the creation of
an initial model system and 30 and 60 min for preliminary equilibration
of the system. Thus, due to these short (real-time) run times, the
number of jobs that can be run in parallel are considered to be sufficient
enough to provide the results in a satisfying time frame. Based on
future interest in the Web service, the Web server hardware can be
extended to fulfill user need.
