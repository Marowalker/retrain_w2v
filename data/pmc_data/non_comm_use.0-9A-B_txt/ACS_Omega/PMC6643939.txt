Hydroxylamine (HA)
can react with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to generate
hydroxyl radical (HO•), but the reaction rate between
them is very slow (2.2 × 10–4 M–1 s–1). We
propose a new system to accelerate the formation of aminoxyl radical
(NH2O•) by the addition of cerium [Ce(IV)]
to induce the continuous production of HO• through
reaction with H2O2. We also investigate the
decolorization and mineralization of rhodamine B (RhB) and mechanism
in the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system. The initial pH
plays a significant role in decolorization of RhB. In this work, observation
of the rapid decolorization process after 60 min revealed that approximately
80% of RhB was degraded at the initial pH of 4.0. The HO• radicals were considered as the primary reactive oxidant in the
system, during its investigation through coumarin capturing, benzoic
acid capturing, and radical quenching experiments. The results of
the present study suggest that the addition of Ce(IV) can greatly
enhance the production of HO•, and the rapid decolorization
and mineralization of RhB can occur through the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system at acidic pH conditions.

1 Introduction
An efficient method for
advanced oxidation processes based on the
hydroxyl radical (HO•) has gained widespread attention.
For decades, it has been widely used to degrade various organic contaminants,
such as pesticides, medicines, and dyes, which are toxic and refractory
biological degradation products in environmental water.1−4 The HO• radical (E0 = 1.8–2.7 V) is more powerful in the degradation process
than the parent oxidant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (E0 = 1.78 V), and HO• can be produced by various methods, such as the electrochemical,
ultraviolet irradiation, heating, alkaline treatment, and Fenton reaction
methods.5,6 Among these active approaches, the homogeneous
Fenton oxidation, which is based on the addition of a transition metal,
has been the most viable methods of achieving H2O2 activation.

In practical applications, a narrow pH range and
the iron sludge
formation are the major obstacles in the homogeneous Fenton oxidation
system.7 Recently, researchers have found
that the addition of hydroxylamine (HA) significantly broadens the
pH range in a Fenton or a Fe(II)/peroxymonosulfate system. Furthermore,
the HA can accelerate the Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox cycles, greatly enhancing
the generation of reactive radicals.8,9 Similarly,
the addition of HA can also increase the efficiency of the Cu(II)/H2O2 or Cu(II)/persulfate system by accelerating
the reduction of Cu(II).10,11 Moreover, some metal
ions, such as transition-metal ions,12 ceric,
and other rare earth metal ions,13,14 can decompose
HA to form the protonated aminoxyl radical (NH2O•). Regardless of the metal ion, H2O2 can also
react with protonated HA to produce NH2O•, and then NH2O• further reacts with
H2O2 to form HO•.15 This finding indicates that NH2O• plays a key role in the production of HO• radicals. Besides, even though the reaction rate of H2O2 and HA is very slow, it gives us a new way of producing
HO•, different from the traditional Fenton reaction,
by introducing a catalyst to promote the production of NH2O• in key species.

Cerium(IV) compounds are
relatively mild oxidant and less toxic
compared with other oxidizing compounds.16 The oxidizing potentials of Ce(IV) in sulfuric acid solutions (E0 = 1.6–1.74 V) have been established.17 Due to the change in the redox potential (ECe4+/Ce3+) with the acidity
of the solution, the oxidation of Ce(III) to Ce(IV) is natural in
weak acidic or alkaline solution. In addition, researchers have confirmed
that hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2•) are
formed by the reaction of Ce(IV) and H2O2 instead
of the HO• radical.18

Considering that the Ce(IV) can react individually with HA
or H2O2, it can be proposed that Ce(IV) can
be instrumental
in enhancing the efficiency of the H2O2/HA system
by accelerating the production of the important intermediate NH2O•. Accordingly, this study proposes a novel
oxidation system using Ce(IV), H2O2, and HA,
which is potentially applicable to decolorization and mineralization
of rhodamine B (RhB). RhB is an important xanthene dye with good stability
that is used as a colorant, but which is dangerous if swallowed by
human beings and animals. RhB has been effectively removed by various
advanced oxidation processes, such as electro-Fenton,19,20 heterogeneous electro-Fenton,21 heterogeneous
Fenton,22 persulfate oxidation,22 and peroxicoagulation.23 The main purpose of this study is to explore the performance of
Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system under different conditions.
For this purpose, the effect of three reactants and the initial pH
are each investigated in this study. Furthermore, a possible mechanism
is proposed based on the detected HO• and the consumption
of HA and H2O2. Finally, the mineralization
ability of the system and degradation pathway for RhB removal was
also evaluated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Decolorization of RhB in Different Systems
To evaluate
the performance of the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA triple
system, all the decolorization processes of RhB under
various conditions are compared in Figure 1a. The results reveal that neither H2O2 nor HA alone changed the concentration of RhB,
and the combination of Ce(IV) with HA did not degrade RhB either.
The decolorization of RhB was negligible in the Ce(IV)/H2O2 system due to its inability to activate H2O2. In contrast, the H2O2/HA and
Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA systems were shown to be capable
of inducing RhB decolorization; the decolorization rate of RhB by
the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system was greater than that
of the simple sum of the Ce(IV) and the H2O2/HA system alone. More than 80% of the RhB was decolorized within
60 min in this system, compared to only 31.1% in the H2O2/HA system. Meanwhile, very slow degradation of RhB
was observed by the Ce(IV) system under acidic pH conditions.24 This can be explained by the strong oxidation
ability of Ce(IV) under acid condition that leads to the formation
of the [Ce(OH)y·nH2O](4–y)+ complex,
which has a large surface area and acts as an oxidizing agent in the
hydrolysis of ceric sulfate.25

Figure 1 (a) Decolorization
of RhB by different systems. (b) Pseudo-first-order
degradation of RhB by the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA and
H2O2/HA systems and observed rate constants
(data from (a)). Error bars represent the standard deviation of the
mean of ln(C/C0) in three
trials. Reaction conditions: [RhB]0 = 10 mg/L, [Ce4+]0 = 0.1 mmol/L, [H2O2]0 = 2 mmol/L, [HA]0 = 2 mmol/L, pHini = 4.

It was observed that the removal
rate of RhB reduced with time
in the H2O2/HA or Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system (Figure 1a). For example, 50% of the RhB was removed within 20 min
of oxidation, whereas 32% of the RhB was removed over the next 40
min. This can be explained by the high RhB concentration leading to
an increase in the rate of effective collision between molecules and
HO•. As the reaction time increases, the concentration
of RhB decreases and that of coproducts increases. This increases
the collision rate between HO• and coproducts, rather
than that of HO• with RhB molecules, which reduces
the RhB removal rate at the later stages. Similar type of degradation
pattern was obtained by Nidheesh et al.21 The degradation of RhB by the H2O2/HA and
Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA systems both followed pseudo-first-order
kinetics (Figure 1b).
The observed rate constant for the RhB degradation by the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system (k = 2.91 ×
10–2 min–1) was approximately
5-fold higher than that by the H2O2/HA system
(k = 5.90 × 10–3 min–1).

It is well established that the H2O2/HA system
produces reactive oxidants by activating H2O2 in two steps.15,26 In the first step, it forms an
intermediate protonated aminoxyl radical (H2NO•+) during the oxidation of HA with H2O2 by an
H-atom abstraction reaction, synchronously generating hydroxyl free
radical (HO•) via reaction 1. In the second step, the reactive oxidant
(HO•) is produced by the reaction of H2O2 with the intermediate protonated aminoxyl radical via
a one-electron-transfer mechanism (reaction 2), which is capable of degrading RhB. However, reaction 1 is slow and limits
the overall kinetics for the production of hydroxyl free radicals. 1   2  In
the reaction medium, Ce(IV) is in equilibrium
with its anionic complexes depending on the acid used. It has been
reported27 that cerium(IV) species in sulfate
acid exist mainly in the form of monomeric species Ce(IV), Ce(OH)3+, and Ce(OH)22+. However, a previous
study28 and thermodynamic calculations
showed that the hydrated form, the Ce(IV) ion, is the predominant
species at low pH values (pH < 1.3), whereas Ce(OH)22+ is the predominant species at a relatively higher pH
(pH > 4). Therefore, under our experimental conditions of pH >
3,
Ce(IV) and Ce(OH)22+ may be considered as the
active species of cerium(IV). It has been demonstrated that cerium(IV)–hydroxylamine
complexes between the ceric species [Ce(IV) and Ce(OH)22+] and the protonated hydroxylamine (NH3OH+) form prior to the fast step,14 and these complexes further decompose to form the NH2O• radical and Ce(III). At the same time, the reaction
does not stop as a result of the formation of nitroxylic acid by a
reaction of the excess cerium(IV) with NH2O• radical. The rate of NH2O• radical
production by the reaction of Ce(IV) with HA is higher than that by
the reaction of H2O2 and HA. Thus, we proposed
that the addition of Ce(IV) changes the kinetics of the above oxidation
reactions by forming Ce(IV)–HA complexes as follows 3   4   5   6  As
a result of the elimination of the choke
point caused by the slow rate of reaction 1, the production of NH2O• is accelerated, resulting in an increase in RhB degradation.

The actual stoichiometric ratio of HA depletion to H2O2 consumption in different systems is shown in Figure 2. It was also observed
that the consumption of hydrogen peroxide is relatively low, with
about 10% HA and 50% H2O2 remaining in the system
after 12 h, indicating that hydroxyl radicals were still produced
in the system. The slope in Figure 2 indicates that the stoichiometric ratio of HA depletion
to H2O2 consumption was about 0.512 in the H2O2/HA system, supporting the two major steps (reactions 1 and 2) involved in the reaction between HA and H2O2. In contrast, the slope of the stoichiometric ratio in the
Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system was 1.576, indicating
that the amount of HA consumed was much higher than the amount of
H2O2 consumed. Evidently, the higher HA consumption
will result in rapid RhB degradation.

2 mmol/L, pHini = 4. Samples were taken at 0, 1, 3, 6,
9, and 12 h, respectively. X-axis error bars represent
the standard deviation of the mean of H2O2 consumption
in three trials, and Y-axis error bars represent
the standard deviation of the mean of HA depletion in three trials.

2.2 Effect
of Initial pH
To understand
the effect of the initial pH on the RhB decolorization process by
the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system, experiments were
conducted at pH 2.0–8.0. The effect of the pH on the removal
of RhB is illustrated in Figure 3. The results of these experiments revealed that the
RhB degradation decreased with increasing pH; the maximum color removal
efficiency was observed when the pH value of the dye solutions was
4. Hence, pH 4 is considered to be the optimal pH for RhB degradation
and selected as the solution pH for further experiments. The degradation
of RhB was significantly inhibited at pH 2.0, which can be explained
by the presence of high proton concentrations that inhibited the reaction
of hydroxyl radical with dye molecules, as hydrogen ions can scavenge
hydroxyl radicals via reaction 7.29,30 In addition, formation of electrophilic
protonated H2O2 (H3O2+) is another scavenging reaction via reaction 8.31 7   8  In the case of pH 5, a sharp increase in efficiency
after 30 min was observed. The change in pH of the solution during
the experiment was monitored and an significant decrease from 5 to
4.5 after reaction 30 min in the solution pH was noted, which resulted
in an increase in the rate of RhB degradation. It is believed that
the H+ is generated through reactions 2–4, which are
the main sources of hydrogen production.

Figure 3 Effect of the pH on the
decolorization of RhB by the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA
system. Reaction conditions: [RhB]0 = 10 mg/L, [Ce4+]0 = 0.1 mmol/L, [H2O2]0 = 2 mmol/L, [HA]0 = 2 mmol/L.

At high pH values (pH > 6), the degradation of RhB is
almost completely
inhibited. The observed decrease in RhB degradation with the increase
in pH may be attributed to the scavenging of HO• by the increase of HA with increasing pH value. Because the pKa1 value of HA is 5.96,32 when the pH value is below 5, most of the HA is in its protonated
form (H3NOH+), whereas at a pH value in the
range of 6.0–14.0, it is mainly in its unprotonated form (H2NOH). It has been reported that the reaction rate between
HO• with H2NOH is faster than that between
HO• with H3NOH+ via reactions 8(33) and 9,34 respectively. In addition, some researchers have proposed that the
protonated form of NH2O•, the one-electron
transfer intermediate of HA with a pKa1 of about 4.2, reacts much faster with H2O2 than the unprotonated NH2O• to produce
HO•.35 Under acidic conditions,
most of the NH2O• are protonated, and
thus the HO• production increases with decreasing
pH. Moreover, another factor controlled by the pH is the activity
of Ce(IV). The solubility product Ksp of
Ce(OH)4 is 3.98 × 10–51, thus a
large percentage of Ce(IV) converts to Ce(OH)4 which may
not be efficient in the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA process
at pH higher than 6.0.25,36 9   10  

2.3 Effects of Ce(IV), H2O2, and
HA Concentrations
To investigate the application of
the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system, RhB decolorization
at pH 4.0 in the presence of varying concentrations of Ce(IV), H2O2, and HA was evaluated, as shown in Figure 4. When the concentrations
of these reactants were changed, the degradation of RhB exhibited
a similar trend, which suggests a close correlation between the decolorization
efficiency and the concentration of Ce(IV), H2O2, and HA. However, although the degradation of RhB was considerably
enhanced with increasing amounts of the initial Ce(IV), H2O2, and HA concentrations until the optimal dosage was
reached, the excess of these three reactants resulted in different
degrees of decrease in the degradation efficiency.

Figure 4 Effects of various conditions
on the performance of RhB decolorization
in the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA triple system. (a) Effect
of Ce(IV) dose; (b) effect of H2O2 dose; and
(c) effect of HA dose. Reaction conditions: [RhB]0 = 10
mg/L, pHini = 4, [H2O2]0 = 2 mmol/L for (a) and (c), [HA]0 = 2 mmol/L for (a)
and (b), and [Ce4+]0 = 0.1 mmol/L for (b) and
(c).

Notably, the observed phenomena
when the concentration of Ce(IV),
H2O2, and HA exceeds the optimal dosage may
be attributed to the excess reagents competing with RhB to consume
HO• free radicals. Consequently, the presence of
superfluous reactants slows the formation of HO• radicals. In this system, it can be assumed that Ce(IV) can react
with HA to produce NH2O• free radicals
through reactions 3 and 4, but can also consume NH2O• free radicals by reaction 6. In addition, excessive Ce(IV) can react with H2O2 with a high rate constant following reactions 11(37) and 12,38 whereas
the HO• radical competes with the reduction product
Ce(III) by reaction 14.39 11   12   13   14  Increased degradation of
RhB was observed
with the increase in the initial HA concentration. This is because
more HA was used to combine with Ce(IV) to produce more NH2O• free radicals, and HO• radicals
were further generated by reactions 1, 3, and 4. However, a vast number of HO• radicals could
be quenched by HA with high rate constants, especially when the HA
concentration was sufficiently high via reactions 9 and 10, resulting in
a decrease in RhB removal. Similarly, excess H2O2 reacts with HO• radicals through reaction 16.40 Therefore, a defined amount of Ce(IV), H2O2, and HA should be selected in the application to maximize the degradation
of target compounds and reduce costs. 15   16  

2.4 Identification
of Primary Reactive Oxidants
Considering the reactions discussed
above, it is proposed that
hydroxyl radicals are the main active species in the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system. Because HO• has
a short lifetime (usually 10–9 s in a cell), it
is difficult to measure directly. Coumarin is a low-fluorescence molecule
but can form the strong fluorescent compound 7-hydroxycoumarin (7OHC,
also known as umbelliferone) by reacting with hydroxyl radicals in
aqueous solutions.41 Therefore, an indirect
detection method was used in this experiment in which coumarin was
regarded as a probe in the medium. All the time, profiles of the fluorescence
intensity of 7OHC under various conditions are presented in Figure 5. These results show
that H2O2/HA and Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA systems were able to induce HO• production,
and the yield of HO• between the two systems is
quite different. In the Ce(IV)/H2O2 system,
the fluorescence intensity of 7OHC was negligible, which confirmed
that the reaction between Ce(IV) and H2O2 does
not produce hydroxyl radicals. The phenomena observed above are consistent
with the degradation trend of RhB shown in Figure 1a. In addition, further quantitative experiment
of hydroxyl radical production was investigated. Figure 6 shows HO• concentrations as a function of reaction time in the H2O2/HA and Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA systems.
Compared with the H2O2/HA system, it has been
observed that hydroxyl radicals are visibly produced more quickly
in the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system. This observation
was in agreement with the hypothesis that Ce(IV) will increase HO• production rate.

reaction time by the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system.
Reaction conditions: [cumarin]0 = 0.1 mmol/L, [Ce4+]0 = 0.1 mmol/L, [H2O2]0 = 2 mmol/L, [HA]0 = 2 mmol/L, and pHini =
4.

acid]0 = 1 mmol/L, [Ce4+]0 = 0.1
mmol/L, [H2O2]0 = 2 mmol/L, [HA]0 = 2 mmol/L, and pHini = 4.

To further explain the mechanism of the system, the effect
of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) [hydroxyl radical scavenger, KTBA,HO• = (3.8–7.6)
× 108 M–1 s–1]
on the degradation of RhB in the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system was investigated. Consider the effects of other superoxides, p-benzoquinone (p-BQ)42 and l-histidine43 were
used as a quencher for superoxide radical (O2–•) and singlet oxygen (1O2), respectively. In
this test, various concentrations of radical scavengers were used
to identify the primary radical species. The addition of TBA inhibited
the RhB degradation by the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system
(Figure 7). Without
TBA, RhB was almost completely degraded in 60 min. However, in the
presence of 100 mM TBA, the degradation efficiency of RhB was only
4.7% in 60 min. Interestingly, the same scavenging effects (about
83%) of p-BQ and l-histidine on the RhB
degradation were observed, which can be explained by the fact that
scavengers inhibit the circulation between Ce(IV) and Ce(III) through reactions 11 and 12. The data shown in Figures 5–7 confirm
the formation of HO• and the dominant position of
HO• in the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA
system.

Figure 7 Effect of quenching agents on degradation of RhB by Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA triple system. Reaction conditions: [Ce4+]0 = 0.1 mmol/L, [H2O2]0 = 2 mmol/L, [HA]0 = 2 mmol/L, and pHini = 4.

2.5 Mineralization
and Final Products of the Degradation
of RhB
According to the above results, HO• was confirmed to be primarily responsible for the decolorization
of RhB. It was further anticipated that it might mineralize organic
pollutants in the aqueous environment. Thus, the removal efficiency
of the total organic carbon (TOC) in the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system was evaluated. The results revealed that a 31.5%
TOC removal of 10 mg/L RhB with the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system was achieved at pH 4 after reacting for 1 h and then reached
44.4, 70.4, and 85.6% after reacting for 3, 6, and 12 h, respectively.
As the reaction time increases, the amount of TOC removal increases,
basically due to the further decomposition of the formed intermediates.
In contrast, only a low TOC removal efficiency (3.7%, data not shown)
was observed in the H2O2/HA system even after
12 h of reaction. Thus, the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA triple
system can accomplish rapid decolorization and mineralization of dyes.

To investigate the mechanism of RhB degradation, the ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorbance of the RhB solutions treated with the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA triple system at different times was determined
by scanning across the full UV–vis spectrum, as shown in Figure 8. The absorption
peak at 554 nm gradually decreases to disappear with the increase
of the treatment time, and the absorption peak at 554 nm was slightly
blue-shifted. Accordingly, we postulated that N-deethylation
and chromophore cleavage happened simultaneously.44 However, the diminishment of the absorption band was much
more obvious than the blue-shift, indicating that the chromophore
cleavage was the major first step of RhB degradation, and this inference
can be further authenticated by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) analysis.

Figure 8 UV–vis absorption spectra of the RhB
solution at the degradation
time of 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min by the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA triple system.

GC–MS analysis was performed to further investigate
the
major degradation intermediates to propose the possible RhB oxidation
pathway in the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA triple system.
The detected intermediates included phenol, ethanamine, 2-hydroxypropanoic
acid, phthalic acid, 3-(isopropoxyamino)propane-1,2-diol, malonic
acid, propane-1,2,3-triol, and terephthalic acid, which are shown
in Table 1. The formed
intermediate compounds are similar to those previously reported in
the literature on the degradation of RhB dye by the conventional Fenton
process.45,46 According to all the identified products,
we concluded that the oxidation process of RhB can be described to
two main steps. They are (1) chromophore cleavage and N-deethylation and (2) mineralization of dye. Normally, the RhB was
first degraded to aromatic compounds and then oxidized to ring-opening
products and organic acids. It has been determined that the chromophore
cleavage and N-deethylation process occur through
the diminishment of the absorption band of RhB at 554 nm. After chromophore
cleavage, the generation of malonic acid and 2-hydroxypropanoic acid
indicate that the RhB dye molecule is effectively oxidized into smaller
carboxylic acid compounds. These carboxylic acid compounds could avoid
an increase in the pH value and the accumulation of Ce(IV), thereby
reducing the production of insoluble cerium hydroxide. Ultimately,
all the small molecular intermediates could be mineralized into CO2 and H2O, as evidenced by the TOC content measurements.
According to the above experimental results, we propose a possible
degradation pathway of RhB in the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA triple system (Figure 9).

of the Detected Small Molecular
Intermediates of RhB during Process of Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA System by GC–MS
These results confirmed that the complex macromolecule
of RhB could
be opened to form small molecules after its degradation, demonstrating
that the degradation-competent form of the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system is desirable.

3 Conclusions
In this study, rapid decolorization and mineralization of RhB were
observed in the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system. Additionally,
a possible reaction mechanism for Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system, which is different from the traditional Fenton-like reaction,
is proposed. First, Ce(IV) and its hydrolyzed hydroxide [Ce(OH)22+] were combined with protonated hydroxylamine
(NH3OH+) to form an intermediate ligand Ce(IV)–HA.
The intermediate was further decomposed to produce the aminoxyl radical
(NH2O•) and the reduced Ce(III). Then,
the NH2O• generated in the first step
reacted with H2O2 to produce highly oxidative
HO• radicals, and Ce(III) was oxidized by H2O2 and HO• into Ce(IV). Eventually,
the HO• radicals attacked the central carbon of
RhB and degraded it to carboxylic acids. The decolorization efficiency
of RhB increased with decreasing pH. In the optimum ratio of Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA (0.1:2:2), about 80% of the RhB was decolorized
within 60 min. The HO• radicals were found to be
the main reactive oxidant through coumarin-capturing and radical-quenching
experiments. Furthermore, the TOC content analysis, UV–vis
spectroscopy, and GC–MS analysis results demonstrated that
the degradation-competent form of the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA system is satisfactory. Moreover, additional studies should not
be confined to Ce(IV) only but also involve other metal ions that
can react with HA to enhance the production of NH2O•, which may act similar to Ce(IV) in the Ce(IV)/H2O2/HA process.

Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All the other chemicals used
in this study, including hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HA, ≥99%),
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 35 wt %), ceric sulfate
[Ce(SO4)2·4H2O], coumarin, p-benzoquinone (p-BQ), H-histidine, benzoic
acid (BA), salicylic acid, and tert-butyl alcohol
(TBA) were of analytical grade and purchased from Aladdin Reagent
Co., Ltd. NaOH and H2SO4, used to adjust the
pH of solutions, were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,

cm ultrapure water from a Millipore system (Water purifier, Sichuan,
China). The H2O2 and HA solutions were freshly
prepared before each experiment to minimize variations in concentration
caused by self-decomposition.

4.2 Oxidation
Reaction
All experiments
were performed in a 100 mL round-bottom flask at air-conditioned room
temperature (23 ± 2 °C) and under normal laboratory light.
Each reactor was operated in batch mode with constant magnetic stirring
provided at the bottom of the reactor. The reaction solution was prepared
by adding HA solutions and the organic contaminant (and Ce4+). RhB stock solution (500 mg/L) was prepared in deionized distilled
water, and specific aliquots of the solution were added into the reactors
to achieve a predetermined initial concentration. The pH of the solution
was adjusted using 1 N H2SO4 or 1 N NaOH solution
to the desired value. The reaction was initiated by adding an aliquot
of a freshly prepared stock solution of H2O2. At the same time, the pH was measured once again; the variation
in pH after the addition of H2O2 was less than
0.1 pH units. Samples (3 mL) were withdrawn at predetermined intervals
and mixed immediately with appropriate amount of sodium sulfite (0.16
mL) to quench the reaction. The experiments were performed in replicate
and the mean value were taken into account; the standard deviations
were limited to <10%.

4.3 Analysis
The concentration
of the
RhB dye (λmax = 554 nm) in the treated solution was
analyzed with a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu
Corp., Kyoto, Japan). The H2O2 concentration
was determined spectrophotometrically using the Ti(SO4)2 method,47 and the concentration
of HA was measured by Molybdenum Blue Photometry. The pH was measured
with a Mettler-FE20 pH meter (Mettler-Toledo, Zürich, Greifensee,
Switzerland). The fluorescence intensity of 7-hydroxycoumarin and
salicylic acid was analyzed on a Fluorescence Spectrometer (RF-5301PC,
Shimadzu Corp.). The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the samples
was determined using a TOC analyzer (Liqui TOC II; Elementar Analysensysteme
GmbH., Hanau, Germany). For each TOC analysis, 20 mL of RhB solution
was treated immediately after the treatment with scavenging reagent
(0.1 M Na2SO3) to obtain the accurate TOC values,
and this procedure led to a complete reduction of the residual H2O2. The productivity of HO• in
the system was investigated by using the oxidation of benzoic acid
(BA) as the model reaction according to the method described by Grossman.48

The intermediate products of RhB degradation
were examined on a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)
system (QP2010 Ultra, Shimadzu Corp.). The GC column was operated
in a temperature-programmed mode at an initial temperature of 40 °C
held for 4 min, then ramped to 80 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min
and held for 2 min, and finally increased to 280 °C at a rate
of 10 °C/min and held at that temperature for 10 min. An injection
volume of 0.1 μL was used with helium as carrier gas. The system
was operated in the electron impact mode at 70 eV and the spectra
were recorded in a scan range of 10–400 m/z. The product analysis was referred to the NIST11 mass
spectral library database.
