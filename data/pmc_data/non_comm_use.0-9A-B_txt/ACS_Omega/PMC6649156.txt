This
paper describes a rapid quantification method for radioactive
strontium (90Sr) in fresh foods (perishable foods) and
has been comparatively evaluated with the common classical radiometric
quantification method. Inductively coupled plasma–dynamic reaction
cell-mass spectrometry with online solid-phase extraction (cascade-ICP–MS)
rapidly determines 90Sr in a pure water-based sample. Despite
its advantages, its application to fresh foods (perishable foods)
has not yet been reported; however, the analytical potential of this
method for fresh foods must be evaluated. In this study, 90Sr was determined in 12 fresh foods via improved cascade-ICP–MS
(Icas-ICP–MS). Addition and recovery tests were demonstrated
using real samples of grape, apple, peach, Japanese pear, rice, buckwheat,
soybean, spinach, shiitake mushroom, grass, sea squirt, and flounder.
With a decomposed solution of Japanese pear, the measurement value
coincided with the amount of spiked 90Sr. The reproducibility
of the measurements was represented by relative standard deviations
of 14.2 and 5.0% for spiked amounts of 20 and 200 Bq/kg, respectively
(n = 10), and the recovery rates were 93.7 ±
7.1%. In this case, the limit of detection (LOD) was 2.2 Bq/kg (=0.43
pg/kg). These results were compared with the data obtained using a
common classical radiometric quantification method (nitrate precipitation-low
background gas flow counter (LBC) method) in the same samples. Both
the methods showed equivalent performances with regard to reproducibility,
precision, and LODs but different analysis times. Icas-ICP–MS
required ∼22 min for analysis, whereas the nitrate precipitation-LBC
method required 20 days, confirming that Icas-ICP–MS is the
suitable method for analyzing 90Sr in fresh foods.

Introduction
Radioactive
strontium-90 (90Sr) is a typical fission
product of uranium with a half-life of 28.74 years, and it is a pure
β-ray emitter (100% β–-decay).190Sr behaves similar to the homologous
element Ca because of their similar chemical properties; therefore,
osteogenic sarcomas can potentially arise because of the incorporation
and accumulation of 90Sr in the growing bone and tissues
when humans absorb 90Sr from food.2 Several reports3−5 have reported the transfer of 90Sr into
foods such as seafood6 as well as animal,7 agricultural,8−11 and dairy products,12−15 which were contaminated by past nuclear incidents. The harmful influence
on human health by ingesting such contaminated food has also been
reported.16−20 Thus, 90Sr analysis, in particular, the rapid analysis
of 90Sr, in fresh foods was performed.21,22

Radiometric methods23 are commonly
used
for determining 90Sr concentration by employing a low background
gas flow counter (LBC),24 a liquid scintillation
counter (LSC),9 or a Cherenkov radiation
counter.10 In radiometric analysis, coexisting
radionuclides interfere with radiation from an analytical target;
therefore, chemical separation is essential for removing coexisting
radionuclides. In Japan, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports,
Science and Technology in Japanese Government (MEXT) recommends using
the LBC method as a standard analytical method for 90Sr
determination. The method requires an ion-exchange and carbonate co-precipitation
step. After reaching secular equilibrium (requires at least 2–3
weeks for ingrowth of 90Y), the separated 90Y is measured by LBC. Consequently, it takes more than 2–3
weeks after sampling to report the results. This nitrate precipitation-LBC procedure24 is recognized
as the Japanese national official analytical method because it can
determine lower 90Sr concentrations using the daughter
nuclide 90Y, which has a higher energy relative to 90Sr. Despite its high sensitivity, nitrate precipitation-LBC24 requires over two weeks to perform the complex
chemical separation and Y-generation (milking) steps, thereby making
the sequential treating of samples difficult. Particularly, a rapid
and sequential analysis of fresh foods is remarkably difficult because
of the time constraints required to achieve commercial validity.

Although rapid analysis of 90Sr has been extensively
studied,25 only a few practical and versatile 90Sr detection methods for analyzing low concentration levels
in a short time are reported. A recently developed method combining
inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP–MS)
with online solid-phase extraction (online SPE) and O2 reaction
[in a dynamic reaction cell (DRC)] could measure 90Sr within
15–30 min in an all-automated analytical system.26 Thus, 90Sr inside an ICP–MS
system could be isolated and purified in a stepwise manner by combining
different types of separation methods; therefore, it was denoted as
“cascade-ICP–MS”.26,27 This technique
was applied to ICP–single MS and ICP–MS/MS.28

A method for one-shot simultaneous data
acquisition allowing the
quantification of 90Sr and the recovery percentage (R %) of Sr (split system),29 an
internal standard corrected signal integration method,30 and a sensitivity improvement system using a
N2–Ar mixed gas effect31 were reported for improving the analytical performance of cascade-ICP–MS.
Several studies combining the above three and the original cascade-ICP–MS
method achieved a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.3 Bq/L (=0.059 pg/L)
in 30 min (as a standard solution).29−31 Herein, this combined
methodology for 90Sr measurement is referred to as an improved
Cascade-ICP–MS system (Icas-ICP–MS). Thus far, Icas-ICP–MS
has been applied to a limited range of almost pure water-based samples
of radioactively contaminated water originating from Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Power Plants, related samples obtained from instruments for
removing radioactive materials, and decomposed solutions of 90Sr-contaminated soil obtained from environmental ponds. While the
method has been applied to water-based samples, it is expected to
be suitable for fresh foods (perishable foods) because of its rapidity.
However, fresh food samples contain complex ingredients (with high
matrix contents); therefore, the results must be thoroughly verified
so that the quantitative values are correct when using the classical
common method.

Herein, Icas-ICP–MS was applied to model
fresh food (typically
12 products) containing very low 90Sr levels. The common
radiometric method was also used to quantify 90Sr concentrations
in identical samples for comparison with the data obtained using the
proposed method (Icas-ICP–MS) with respect to reproducibility,
accuracy, LOD, and recovery. All model samples were obtained from
commercially available products manufactured in Fukushima Prefecture.
This paper describes original 90Sr concentrations in these
fresh foods.

Results and Discussion
Evaluation of Analytical
Performance of Icas-ICP–MS for 90Sr Analysis
The components of Icas-ICP–MS
are based on previous reports.26,29−31Figure 1 shows the
outline and flow design. The detailed measurement protocol is described
in the “Measurements” part
of the Experimental section. The Icas-ICP–MS system for 90Sr analysis comprised [I] the cascade-ICP–MS26 (i.e., online SPE–O2 reaction
in the DRC–quadrupole mass filter), [II] a one-shot simultaneous
data acquisition system quantifying both 90Sr and R % of Sr (split system),29 [III]
an internal standard corrected signal integration method,30 and [IV] a sensitivity improvement system using
a N2–Ar mixed gas effect.31 The experimental details of this system are included in the “Measurements” section.

Figure 1 Eight-channel flow map
of the lab-on-valve system (double four-way
switching valves) with a split-flow line system. [A] indicates the
sample pass ways of a major volume of the sample introducing into
the SPE column and minor part of the sample divided by the splitter
introducing into ICP–MS for direct analysis of initial concentration
of Sr. [B] indicates the sample pass ways of a preconcentrated Sr
by SPE for introduction into ICP–MS.

Figure 2 shows
a
5 Bq/L 90Sr peak profile of the reference material solution
(black line). As a reference, a blank peak (0 Bq/L of 90Sr, gray line) is also shown in Figure 2. The peak area depends on the 90Sr concentration, as shown in the inset of Figure 2. For a 50 mL sample injection, the LOD (3σ)
was 0.35 Bq/L (equal to a mass concentration of 0.07 pg/L) and the
measurement time was 22 min. This indicates sufficient removal of
interfering components such as 90Zr and 74Ge,
which were essentially contained in the concentration range of ppt–sub
ppb as ingredients of the natural solution (note: isobar (m/z = 90; 74Ge16O)
was produced by reaction of 74Ge and oxygen). During this
time, the final volume introduced into the ICP–MS after online
SPE was 0.6 mL (±1.1%). This result was calculated from the eluate
flow rate (5.0 mL/min), detected peak width (14.4 s ± 1.1%, n = 15), and sample dilution rate (an injected sample was
diluted twice with the internal standard solution in the flow line)
[namely, 5.0/60.0 (mL/s) × 14.4 s(±1.1%) × 0.50 = 0.6
mL]. Based on these values, the volume ratio between the initial solution
(50 mL) and after preconcentration was 83.3 times.

Figure 2 Quantifying the signal
profile of 90Sr using the proposed
method. Black peak line: the injection sample was a 50 mL solution
containing 5 Bq/L radioactive 90Sr and 80 ppb natural isotope
of Sr. Gray peak line: the sample was a 50 mL solution containing
80 ppb natural isotope of Sr. The intensities are a linear function
of the 90Sr concentration vs the peak area (inset). The
volume ratio between samples before and after preconcentration (50
→ 0.6 mL) was 83.3 times. Eluate flow rate: 5 mL/min. The LOD
was 0.35 Bq/L. Total measurement time was 22 min. The 5 Bq/L is equal
to 1 pg/L.

Stable 88Sr peaks before
and after SPE were simultaneously
obtained using a split method29 during
one sample injection into this system. Figure 3A shows the 88Sr peak before SPE,
that is, the original solution flowed into the split line (bypass
line). Figure 3B shows
a peak of preconcentrated 88Sr eluated from the SPE column.
Linearity is observed between the 88Sr intensity measured
in the split line (i.e., 88Sr original concentration before
SPE) and the preconcentrated 88Sr peak area (i.e., 88Sr concentration after SPE), as shown in Figure 4. The published cascade-ICP–MS
method also shows almost complete R % (99%, RSD 1.2%)29 in measuring water-based reference material
solutions. Based on this property, the proposed method gave the actual R % using the data in Figure 4 (i.e., the actual R % values were
obtained by calculating the ratio between the actual and theoretical
preconcentrated concentrations).

Figure 3 Signal profiles of Sr in the proposed
method. The sample was a
50 mL solution containing 100 Bq/L radioactive 90Sr and
5 μg/L stable Sr. Panel [A] indicates the 88Sr signal
from the bypass line. Panel [B] presents the signal of preconcentrated 88Sr and 90Sr from the online column.

Figure 4 Relation between the 88Sr intensity flowing
in the split
line and the peak area of the preconcentrated 88Sr eluated
from the column line. The sample volume was 10 mL.

The measured and spiked concentrations obtained
using the proposed
method were sufficiently consistent, as shown in Figure 5A. Additionally, the reproducibility
was improved by increasing the 90Sr concentration in the
sample, as shown in Figure 5B (i.e., RSD was 14.1 and 3.1% for 4 and 10 Bq/L of 90Sr, respectively). R % showed stable values (R %; 97 ± 5.8% (n = 18) regardless
of the 90Sr concentration in the calibration range).

the concordance of the 90Sr concentrations between the
spiked certified reference material and the quantitative values obtained
by the proposed method. Panel [B] presents the variation in the quantitative
values with the proposed method. The RSD represents the relative standard
deviation of the measurement (n = 3).

Otherwise, to obtain LOD values for each food samples,
certain
different concentrations of certificated 90Sr were added
to the food sample. The LOD values were obtained from these lines.
The average LOD (n = 12, 3σ) was 0.35 ±
0.14 Bq/L, which was equal to 1.7 Bq/kg as a solid sample (=0.33 pg/kg
as a mass concentration).

Analytical Performance Evaluation: Comparison
of 90Sr Analysis via Nitrate Precipitation-LBC with Icas-ICP–MS
Samples [50 mL standard solution (n = 5 samples)]
identical to those for Icas-ICP–MS measurement were subjected
to analysis via nitrate precipitation-LBC, which is commonly used
for official analysis. When 2 or 10 Bq/L of 90Sr was added,
the measured values were 2.66 Bq/L (RSD 5.7%) and 12.6 Bq/L (RSD 2.6%),
respectively. During this time, the LODs of 90Sr were 0.18
and 0.20 Bq/L. The Sr recovery rates were 97.1% (RSD 1.6%, n = 5) and 94.7% (RSD 0.5%, n = 5) respectively.
A total of 20 days was required for the analysis.

Table 1 lists a comparison of the analytical
values obtained via Icas-ICP–MS and nitrate precipitation-LBC
when analyzing 50 mL of standard solution containing 4 or 10 Bq/L
of 90Sr. Results revealed that in the Icas-ICP–MS
analysis, compared with nitrate precipitation–LBC analysis,
the LOD, the coincidence ratio in relation to the added amount, the
dispersion (precision) of the measured value, the reproducibility,
and the recovery rate were essentially comparable. However, the Icas-ICP-MA
method is much more rapid, requiring only 22 min relative to 20 days
for the nitrate precipitation–LBC method. In contrast, the
recovery rate in Icas-ICP–MS analysis gradually decreases with
increase of sample injection exceeding 60 mL25; however,
with nitrate precipitation-LBC analysis, the sample volume can be
increased. Thus, when the sample size is large, lower concentrations
can be measured via nitrate precipitation–LBC analysis than
Icas-ICP–MS.

Otherwise, this Icas-ICP–MS basically uses Eichrom Sr resin
in the SPE prior to ICP–MS analysis. Alternatively, Eichrom
Sr resin with LBC may give rise to an interference of Sr analysis.
The Eichrom Sr resin can trap not only Sr but also Ba and Pb.26 Pb exists in 210Pb which emits radiation,
and the nuclide interferes Sr analysis in radiometric analysis such
as the LBC method. Therefore, when the Eichrom Sr resin is used in
the radiometric analysis, the spectrophotometric separations using
LSC32 or beta-ray spectrometer33 will be needed.

Analysis of Actual Samples
Containing 90Sr
The measurement results (recovery;
detection limits) obtained from
the analysis, the decomposition solutions of 12 agricultural and marine
commercial products (obtained from markets in Fukushima Prefecture)
via the Icas-ICP–MS method are summarized in Table 2. Samples were prepared by the
addition of 0 (no addition), 20, or 200 Bq/kg 90Sr to the
decomposition solutions. Results reveal that all of the samples with
any added 90Sr were below the LOD and that 90Sr was not detected by any method. LOD was within 0.43–2.95
Bq/kg (=0.08–0.59 Bq/L) in each sample, and there was no remarkable
difference in the variety of samples. Furthermore, the quantitative
values almost coincided with the samples with the addition of 20 or
200 Bq/kg. As a reference, Figure S1 in the Supporting Information shows the peak profile when 200 Bq/kg of 90Sr was added to grapes. The shape of the peak showed the same as
in the case of the standard solution. Japanese pear (84–109%)
showed a high recovery rate, but soy beans (21–25%), spinach
(31–37%), and sea squirt (35–51%) produced low recovery
rates (note: the recovery rate means whole recovery rate for the total
analytical system as ICP–MS. Those are not only resin recovery).
This can be attributed to the fact that the presence of excess stable
Sr isotope inhibits plasma ionization and disturbance occurs during
ICP–MS measurements (cf. Table S1 in the Supporting Information). When excess concentration of the
solute in sample solution is injected into ICP–MS, it is well
known that the quantification of the target is typically interfered
by the space charge effect. The quantitative values were consistent
with the addition amounts obtained by correcting with these recovery
rates and a correction method.29 Most of
the repeated reproducibility (n = 3) of the measured
values for the samples under the same conditions was within 10%, but
the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the measured value tended
to improve as the 90Sr amount increased (200 Bq/kg was
added in this case).

Reproducibility tests (n = 10) were conducted
on Japanese pears via the use of the Icas-ICP–MS method by
measuring samples under the same conditions consecutively. As a result,
for the samples with the addition of 20 or 200 Bq/kg, RSDs of the
measured values were 14.2 and 5.0%, respectively, and stable measurement
values were obtained (cf. Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Results showed the same extent of dispersion
as in the analysis of standard 90Sr solutions, and the
quantitative values were consistent with the added amounts at all
times. During this time, the analyses of all 10 samples were concluded
in a total of approx. 220 min. This result indicated that Icas-ICP–MS
is faster when compared to the radiological analysis.

Table 3 shows the
results obtained via nitrate precipitation-LBC and their comparison
with Icas-ICP–MS. Similar to nitrate precipitation-LBC, all
the samples with no 90Sr addition (12 samples in total)
showed results below the LOD. When 90Sr-added samples (20
Bq/kg) were measured, the quantitative value obtained via nitrate
precipitation-LBC substantially agreed with the added amount. Moreover,
the results almost coincided with the results of Icas-ICP–MS
(Table 2). The LOD
of nitrate precipitation-LBC tended to be slightly higher than that
of Icas-ICP–MS. In other words, if the amount of the solid
sample used for the measurement was 10 g, the analytical sensitivity
of Icas-ICP–MS was slightly better than that of nitrate precipitation-LBC.

Evaluation of 90Sr Analysis Performance
of Icas-ICP–MS
in Various Samples
To confirm the quantitative character
in real sample analysis, representative samples were selected and 90Sr was added in various concentrations and analyzed. We selected
peach, brown rice, and flounder as the model sample for fruit, grain,
and fish, respectively. To each of these samples, 20, 50, 100, 200,
and 500 Bq/kg of 90Sr was added and measurements were performed
using n = 3. Results are shown in Figure 6. Good linearity was obtained
over a wide range from all samples, with good agreement between the
addition amount and the measured value. All samples showed good reproducibility.
These results verified that with Icas-ICP–MS, quantitative
values could be adequately obtained in fresh food samples of different
composition at various concentration levels.

Figure 6 Relationship between
the spiked concentration of the certified
reference solution and the measurement values with the proposed method
in actual analysis of various fresh food samples.

Icas-ICP–MS employs a Sr adsorption column; therefore,
the
recovery rate may decrease as the column is consumed by the sequential
injection of samples. Therefore, a fresh food sample with 90Sr addition was repeatedly injected into Icas-ICP–MS and the
change in the recovery rate of the column when used for fresh food
was verified. Pear, peach, brown rice, and flounder were selected
as typical samples for fruit, grain, and seafood, respectively. For
comparison, the standard solution was measured. To each of these samples,
200 Bq/kg (=40 Bq/L = 8 pg/L) of 90Sr was added and maximum
of 18 continuous measurements were performed. The results are shown
in Figure 7. Specific
recovery rate is shown for each sample. The results of the first measurement
are the same as those shown in Table 2. After 18 measurements, a slight decrease in recovery
rate was confirmed for all samples. It is considered that slight decrease
in recovery rates arise from the deterioration of efficiency of Sr-reins.
However, because the recovery rates can be always monitored at the
same time as quantification using the split method, the quantitative
value was consistent with the addition amount. These results indicated
that Icas-ICP–MS is useful in the repeated analysis of fresh
food samples containing various matrix components.

rate in sequential injection of actual
fresh food samples (solution). [90Sr]T = 200
Bq/kg (=40 Bq/L = 8 pg/L).

Figure 8 shows
the
results of the reproducibility tests (n = 3 or more)
with various concentrations of 90Sr added to the 12 fresh
samples. Results confirmed that the RSD value drastically increased
below a certain 90Sr concentration. Thus, it was confirmed
that a stable quantitative value of RSD ≤ 10% could be obtained
by measuring 50 mL of solution that contains 90Sr of 20
Bq/kg (=5 Bq/L) or more. This result was similar to that obtained
from measuring the standard solution (Figure 5B).

values in actual

reference solution spiked to actual fresh food samples were plotted.

Conclusions
Because
the official radiometric analysis for a small amount of 90Sr in the order of several Bq requires time for pretreatment,
it was difficult to analyze a large number of specimens in short time.
Therefore, it was difficult to apply food analysis to foods that quickly
perish, such as fresh food. In this study, a rapid 90Sr
analysis with 12 types of fresh food was conducted using Icas-ICP–MS
that employs online solid-phase extraction with ICP–DRC-MS;
comparative evaluation was performed using classical radiometric measurement.
For comparison with the Icas-ICP–MS analysis, the nitrate precipitation-LBC
method, which is a radiometric analysis method, was conducted. Samples
were tested by adding and recovering 90Sr to Japanese fresh
foods. For the sample, the dissolved sample was divided for Icas-ICP–MS
and nitrate precipitation-LBC analyses; results were compared for
samples analyzed under the same condition, which revealed that the
quantitative values of 90Sr substantially agreed with the
addition amount in both the methods. The LOD was 0.4–3.0 Bq/kg
and the time required for the measurement was about 22 min. Meanwhile,
with this method, the nitrate precipitation-LBC analysis matched the
quantitative values well. Furthermore, for each LOD, both the methods
indicated an almost equal analytical sensitivity. Icas-ICP–MS
proved to be useful for the analysis of fresh foods because it shortened
the analysis time from 20 days (nitrate precipitation-LBC) to 22 min
(Icas-ICP–MS).

Methods and Experiments
Apparatus
Icap-ICP–MS:
as an analytical system
for 90Sr, we adopted online solid-phase extraction coupled
to ICP–MS,29 and this system comprised
the following instruments: a NexION 350S instrument (PerkinElmer,
Inc., Shelton, CT, USA) with ultrapure O2 as a reaction
gas (>99.99995%) in a collision-reaction cell (DRC). A make-up
gas
mass flow upgrade kit was installed in ICP–MS to pass N2 gas to improve sensitivity.31 An
U5000AT+ ultrasonic nebulizer (Teledyne CETAC Technology, NE, USA),
a FIAS 400 flow-injection system (PerkinElmer) with specially fabricated
double eight-way switching valves, and an S10 autosampler for ICP–MS
(PerkinElmer) were attached to an ICP–MS. The experimental
parameters and conditions for ICP–DRC-MS are shown in Table
S2 in the Supporting Information.

The splitter and microvolume mixer components of the split line were
obtained from GL Science Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan. The velocity of the
solution in the tube was measured using a Truflo flowmeter (Glass
Expansion, Melbourne, Australia). The velocity was controlled by varying
the tube diameters as follows.

For the split ratio, main/split
ratio = 23:1 as well as the internal
diameters (IDs) of the solution feeder (main tube), split line, and
internal standard solution feeder were 0.76, 0.13, and 0.19 mm, respectively.
All these tubes were peristaltic pump tubes made from polyvinyl chloride.
Other flow tubes were constructed from fluorophenylalanine tubing
with an ID of 0.8 mm. Under these conditions, the volume ratio between
the main and split flows was 100:4.

Nitrate precipitation-low
background gas flow counting system (nitrate
precipitation-LBC): a LBC-4202B LBC (Hitachi Aloka Medical Co., Ltd,
Tokyo, Japan) was employed by applying 1750 V (in the Geiger–Muller
region). Measurement was conducted using a 10% methane–90%
argon mixed gas (PR gas). Additionally, an Optima 7300 DV ICP–atomic
emission spectrometer (ICP–AES) was employed for measuring
the stable Sr recovery efficiency.

Reagents
Sr stock
solution (single element; stable
isotopes; concentration 1000 ppm) and the other single-element stock
solutions were obtained from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Working
solutions (20% HNO3) and all injected samples (20% HNO3) were prepared by appropriate serial dilution of the metal
ion solutions in water or ultrapure nitric acid. The radioactive 90Sr stock solution (1.005 × 103 Bq/g) was
obtained from the public interest incorporated association, Japan
Radioisotope Association (JRA, Tokyo, Japan) with a calibration certificate.
It was serially diluted to the appropriate concentration in water
or ultrapure nitric acid (20% HNO3 sol). Water obtained
from a DIRECT-Q3 UV Ultrapure water supply system (Merck Millipore
SAS, Molsheim, France) was used. The concentrated HNO3 (high-purity
electronic grade, 61 w/w %) was obtained from Kanto Chemical Co.,
Inc. (Tokyo, Japan).

SPE powders (250 mg) of an Eichrom Sr resin
[particle diameter 50–100 μm; chemical composition 4,4′(5′)-di(t-butylcyclohexano)-18-crown-6, purchased from Eichrom Technologies,
LLC (IL, USA)] were packed into original empty polytetrafluoroethylene
columns (PerkinElmer Japan, ID 4.0 mm, length 50 mm), and these were
used as special SPE columns for installing into Icas-ICP–MS.
In use, the two special SPE columns were connected in series. All
other required reagents and organic solvents (analytical grade materials)
were purchased from Wako Chemical Co., Ltd. and used without further
purification.

Sample Collection and Pretreatment
Agricultural, forestry,
and fishery products from the vicinity of Fukushima Prefecture were
selected as model samples; 2–10 kg of 12 items, which were
fruits (grapes, apples, peaches, and Japanese pears); cereals (rice,
buckwheat, and soybeans); farm products (spinach, shiitake mushrooms,
and grass); and marine products (flounder and sea squirt) were obtained
from a wholesale market or fishermen’s cooperative. Details
of the samples are given in the Supporting Information (photos, breeds, states, collection data, and locations of the samples
are provided).

The samples were treated according to the literature,24,34 and these procedures (carbonization and solubilization) are described
in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information, that is, the samples were sorted into waste and edible parts, whereby
1 kg or more of edible parts were obtained. The edible parts were
homogenized using a mixer (such as a food mixer). Three hundred grams
of aliquot were placed on a porcelain evaporating dish and dried to
constant weight. After drying, the sample was carbonized with an electric
heater and heated in an electric furnace at 500 °C for 48 h.
Aqua regia was added to the incinerated sample, which was then evaporated
to dryness on a hot plate. Then, nitric acid was added and the sample
was evaporated to dryness again. One to three hundred milliliters
of nitric acid (1 + 4) was then added. The sample was heated on the
hot plate for 1 h and then suction-filtered using a Buchner funnel
and filter paper (no. 5C). The residue was rinsed with nitric acid
(1 + 4). The filtrate and washed residue were combined and transferred
to a 2 L measuring cylinder. The volume was then adjusted to 1500
mL with nitric acid (1 + 4). Fifty milliliter aliquots of the solubilized
sample were distributed; then, an appropriate amount of certified
reference solution of 90Sr was spiked into these distributed
samples. These samples were then subjected to the nitrate precipitation-LBC
and Icas-ICP–MS methods for analysis.

Measurements
Quantification
of 90Sr Using Icas-ICP–MS
As shown in Figure 1A, 50 mL of sample
solution containing 90Sr (20% HNO3 aq. sol.)
was injected into the Icas-ICP–MS system
via an autosampler. After injection, the sample was split two ways
and a major volume of the sample was passed through the main flow
line powered by the pump#1 (5 mL/min). The sample was then introduced
into the SPE column. Strontium in the sample was adsorbed on resin
in the column, and other materials that did not adsorb on the resin
were discharged to drain. The minor part of the sample was passed
through the split flow line powered by the pump#2. The split ratio
of the sample volume was main-line/split line = 23:1. A solution of
elute and internal standard (ISTD) material solution containing indium
(In) was added to the divided sample in the split line on the flow
line and thoroughly mixed with the mixer. The solution was nebulized
by an ultrasonic nebulizer (USN) and introduced into the ICP–MS.
N2–Ar mixed gas (1%) [1% ultrapure N2 gas (>99.9995%) was added to ultrapure Ar gas (>99.999%)]
was used
as plasma gas because of sensitivity improvement30 [note: mixed gas was generated prior to USN using a T-connector;
thus, the mixed gas was used for sample nebulization via USN].

In this way, the stable isotope 88Sr was detected (this
time, O2 gas was introduced to DRC). As a result, 88Sr contained in the split sample, that is, 88Sr
concentration before condensation (SPE) was quantified by preparing
a calibration curve based on the concentration versus intensity of
the 88Sr standard solution in advance.

After all
of the samples were passed through the column, the column
was cleaned with a nitric acid solution after the adsorption of Sr
by passing 20% nitric acid (flow rate 5 mL/min). Thereafter, the state
shown in Figure 1B
occurs when the automatic valve is switched. In this state, ultrapure
water was made to flow as the eluent (=cleaning solution) in the main
channel and the concentrated Sr was eluted from the column on the
main channel. This concentrated Sr was mixed with In solution as ISTD,
nebulized by USN, and introduced into the ICP–MS. The sample
was nebulized by USN and plasma-ionized with mixed gas of ultrapure
Ar gas (>99.999%) obtained by mixing 1% of ultrapure N2 gas (>99.9995%)29 [note: gas mixing
was
performed by using a T connector immediately before USN. Therefore,
atomization by USN was also performed with mixed gas]. Subsequently,
O2 reaction was conducted in DRC and isotopes, such as 90Sr and 88Sr, after concentration was detected
by the QMS filter. Quantitation was calculated by preparing a calibration
curve based on the standard solution concentration versus peak area
of 88Sr in advance. In this way, the 88Sr and 90Sr concentrations were determined after concentration (SPE).

While performing these measurements, the flow path was cleaned
up by passing the eluent (=ultrapure water as cleaning solution) through
the split channel (flow rate of 5 mL/min).

The operation and
step contents of FI used for online SPE are shown
in Table S3 in the Supporting Information. The time required for one sample measurement was 22 min. The method
for quantitative determination of 90Sr by Icas-ICP–MS
and conversion to radioactivity concentration.

By adjusting
the MS bias, measurement could be performed using
the method that quantifies 90Sr using the stable isotope
as a standard substance,25 the Sr recovery
rate obtained by the split method,28 and
the online internal standard correction method.29 The 90Sr weight concentration was converted
to the radioactivity concentration Bq/L using the following equation.  where A, t(1/2), m, Mn, and NA indicate the radioactivity
concentration
(Bq/L), half-life (s), weight (g) of the analyte to be analyzed per
liter (in this instance 90Sr), mass number of the measured
isotope, and Avogadro’s number (cf. in the sample amount of
this study, 90Sr was 5 Bq/kg = 1 Bq/L = 0.2 pg/L) respectively.

Nitrate Precipitation-LBC
Samples were analyzed using
the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
(MEXT) oxalate method.23 The samples were
the same as those measured with Icas-ICP–MS. The flowchart
of the analysis process is shown in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information. The time required for one sample measurement
was 20 days. The recovery rate was obtained by measuring stable Sr
(carrier) with solutions before and after precipitation with ICP–AES.
The 90Sr radioactivity concentration was corrected on the
date of sample preparation using the decay curve.

Analysis
of the Major Components in the Sample
With
the 90Sr measurement, the major components in the samples
were analyzed. The water content, ash percentage, and concentrations
of potassium, calcium, and stable strontium were measured. The analytical
procedure obtained from the Japan Consumer Affairs Agency is shown
in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. The water and ash contents were calculated from the weight after
the sample reached constant weight and the weight after incineration,
respectively. The results are shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.
