In this work, we have successfully
synthesized superparamagnetic
nanocomposites, Ce4–xSr1+xFe5–xZnxO14+δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.45) (CSFZ) (TA1–TA4: x = 0, 0.15,
0.30, and 0.45) via the Nitrate–citrate sol–gel method.
X-ray diffraction studies show the formation of single-phase nanocomposites
(NCs) and the average crystallite size is found to be 18 nm. Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy analysis supports the formation of the desired
product with the expected composition. The scanning electron microscopy
image shows that the prepared samples are in spherical shape and highly
porous in nature. Most of the particle sizes present in the image
are in the range of 5–20 nm. The optical studies show an intense
peak at 583 nm corresponding to the instantaneous existence of both
Fe2+ and Fe3+ intervalence electronic charge
transition bands. X-ray photoelectron spectra analysis confirms the
presence of elements with their preferred oxidation state. The superparamagnetic
nature of the prepared sample was confirmed by vibrating sample magnetometer
analysis. Synthesized materials show a low saturate magnetic moment
ranging from 0.3400 to 0.1075 emu/g. The coercivity and retentivity
value of the synthesized NC is zero. The NCs show
high encapsulation efficiency toward ciprofloxacin hydrochloride because
of their unique structure and release the loaded drug molecules in
a sustained manner up to 10 h at pH 7.4. Such NCs have high potential
for use as multifunctional material in various fields such as optical
properties, conductivity studies, dielectric, sensor, and drug delivery
properties.

1 Introduction
In
the last
few decades, the word starts with “nano” have been hurried
into the scientific research field such as, nanomaterial, nanocomposites,
nanocolloids, nanoparticle, nanocluster, nanoreactor and etc.1,2 The increased interest to research the nano objects corresponds
to the innovation of chemical and physical properties of prepared
nanomaterials and also relates to their quantum-size effects. Currently,
exclusive physical properties of the NCs are under concentrated research.
There is a wide difference in the magnetic properties between the
bulk material and nanomaterials. Magnetization and the magnetic anisotropy
properties of the nanomaterials are always higher than that of bulk
molecules, especially at Curie (TC) or Neel (TN) temperatures.3 Including this, nanomaterials possess some other
properties such as large magneto resistance, abnormally high magnetocaloric
effect, and so on. Nanoparticle magnetic properties are influenced
by chemical composition, particle size, structure, morphology, type,
and the degree of the defectiveness in the crystal lattice. By changing
the characteristics of the nanoparticle, one can control to an extent
the magnetic properties of the material concerned. However, it is
difficult to synthesize nanomaterials having the same properties by
controlling the reaction alone, and therefore, the nanomaterial shows
distinctly different properties. Most of the particles are not similiar
in size because of their different proportions.

In recent years,
there has been increasing emphasis on materials
that are applicable in biomedical areas. Biomaterials are synthetic
materials used to replace parts of a living system from a biological
material. Bioactive materials have specific biological responses at
the interface of the material with the biological tissue, which results
in the formation of a bond between the living part and the material.4−12 NC materials with nanoscale separation of phases improve the macroscopic
properties of the products. Multilayer NCs which possess magnetic
property are used in the storage media. They are either multilayer
structures or inorganic/organic composites. Gas phase deposition produces
multilayer structures or monolayer self-assembly. In general, organic
or inorganic NCs are easily prepared by the sol–gel manner.13−18

Rare-earth elements and their compounds are used for a wide
variety
of applications in chemistry and materials science. The rare-earth
compounds with elements exhibiting several oxidation states find uses
as catalysts, laser, and other optical materials that make use of
their magnetic properties.19−21 Considering the wide variety
of applications and potentialities of the rare earth-doped transition
metals, it is our desire to understand their structure and physical
properties. Cerium oxide-based systems are used in photosensitive
glass as a catalyst to polish glass and stone. Also, Fe2O3-containing systems exhibit interesting electrical conductivity.
Combining these two interesting properties together in a single platform
may yield materials with excellent activities in electrical, conductivity,
and magnetic properties. Herein, we report the structure–property
relations of CSFZ oxide systems and their drug-releasing behaviors.

2 Results and Discussion
Four combinations of metal oxide
(TA1–TA4) were prepared
by a sol–gel procedure. The prepared metal oxides were characterized
by various analytical techniques.

2.1 Crystal Structure
Figure 1 shows the
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the samples TA1–TA4. The powder XRD pattern
confirms the formation of a single-phase material. The XRD patterns
for all the compositions (TA1–TA4) are similar, and the predominant
peaks appeared with the same diffraction angle. This indicates that
the crystalline phases of all the prepared composites are of similar
type. XRD peaks of all the samples produced appreciable diffraction
broadening, and it is reasonably assumed that this arises from the
crystallite size. The crystallite size (D) of the
samples is calculated using the Debye–Scherrer formula (eq 1) 1  where K is the shape factor,
β is the full line width at the half-maximum, and θ is
the Bragg angle. Crystallites sizes were calculated using the above
equation for all intense peaks, and the average crystallite size is
found to be in the range of 5–20 nm. The crystallite size (D) and micro strain (ε) were also confirmed by the
Williamson–Hall plot (uniform deformation model) (Figure S1), and the average crystallite size
is calculated by using eq 2. 2

0.45) (TA1–TA4).

The average crystallite size is found to be 18 nm. The unit
cell
parameter is obtained using XRD data by Treor90 software, and the
data are given in Table 1.

2.2 Structural and Morphological
Studies
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 2) of the CSFZ composite
at 5 μm magnification
show that the metal oxides exist as NCs. Furthermore, the SEM image
shows that the prepared samples are in spherical shape and highly
porous in nature. However, in some places, the prepared composites
have shown the particles with irregular shapes like nanoflakes (TA2
and TA3) and nanoclusters (TA4). Most of the particles present in
the image are in the range of 5–20 nm. Also, the average particle
size of the CSFZ NC is found to be nearly 9 nm. Because of unavoidable
aggalomerization that occurred during the synthetic procedure by various
methodologies, the prepared materials are not formed with a uniform
structure. These different morphological structures and particle sizes
of prepared NCs are useful for enhanced activity in electric and magnetic
properties.

Figure 2 SEM images of Ce4–xSr1+xFe5–xZnxO14+δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.45) TA1–TA4 at 5 μm.

To confirm the presence of Ce, Sr, Zn, Fe, and O in the prepared
NCs, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) study is carried out. Figure 3 shows the EDX spectrum
of a selected area of the prepared CSFZ NC. From the Figure 3a–d, it is confirmed
that the CSFZ contains elements like oxygen, cerium, strontium, iron,
and zinc. The absence of any other elements in the EDX spectrum indicates
the purity of the CSFZ NC which is prepared by the sol–gel
method.

Further, the internal structure of the prepared CSFZ was
examined
closely by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) analysis. The TEM images of the NC TA2 (as a representative
of the synthesized series) at different magnifications are presented
in Figure 4. From Figure 4a–c, it is
confirmed that the TEM images of the CSFZ NC have shown the spherical
structure, and most of the particles have sizes below 10 nm. Also,
the TEM images of CSFZ (Figure 4d,e) show a clear two-dimensional lattice fringe image with
the interlattice spacing of 0.258 and 0.436 nm which correspond to
the crystalline space (102) and (202), respectively. From this, it
is confirmed that the prepared NCs have a pure tetragonal phase structure.
The selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) was recorded,
and it appeared as a set of sharp diffraction spots (Figure 4f). The appeared pattern of
intermittent bright dots with concentric rings indicates that the
material exists in a high crystalline nature with a particle size
of below 10 nm which is related to the super paramagnetic nature of
the system.

SAED pattern at 51 nm.

X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis is a main tool
to determine
oxidation states of elements with comparison of their binding energies
(BEs). Figure 5a shows
the survey spectrum for TA2 of the CSFZ composite, and it proves that
the elements iron, zinc, strontium, cerium, and oxygen are present
in the synthesized composite. The BEs were confirmed by the standard
carbon 1s peak at a BE of 285.2 eV. Iron appeared in the valence states
of Fe3+ and the peak positions of 2p3/2 and
2p5/2 (Figure 5b) spin orbit doublet components of Fe3+ appeared
in the BEs of 710 and 724.8 eV, respectively.14Figure 5c shows the
XPS spectrum of zinc, and it is present in the oxidation states of
Zn2+, and the peak positions of 2p1/2 and Zn
2p3/2 are located at 1045.6 and 1021.4 eV, respectively.10 From Figure 5d, it has been proved that strontium is present in
the 3d valance state with the BE of 133.2 and 135.0 eV for 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively. It is also confirms
that strontium is present in the Sr2+ oxidation state.15 BEs at 882.5 and 897.8 eVs (Figure 5e) correspond to the signals
of Ce 3d5/2 and Ce 3d3/2, which confirms that
the cerium is present as the Ce3+ oxidation state in the
synthesized CSFZ composite.24 Two kinds
of oxygen species, α and β, are located at 529.6 and 531.8
eV (Figure 5f).19 The intensity of the peak is related to the
concentration of oxygen vacancies. Therefore, the concentration of
oxygen vacancies will change the intensity of the prepared components.

2.3 Optical Properties
Figure 6 shows the calculated and the
experimental optical absorption spectra of samples TA1–TA4,
respectively. An intense absorption peak, which appears at 231 nm
may be attributed to the change of charge-transfer transitions. The
peak at 582 nm is due to the instantaneous presence of both Fe3+ and Fe2+ intervalance charge-transfer electronic
transition band. The peak at 754 nm is assigned to the transition
of 6A1g(S) to 4T1g(G)
and 6A1g(S) to 4T2g(G)
state of the Fe3+ ion.25 The
other bands observed at 231, 324, and 348 nm are assigned to the transition
from 4f1 (2F5/2) to 5d1 (2D3/2) of the Ce3+ ion.26

2.4 Magnetic Properties
The magnetic
properties of the CSFZ NCs are calculated by Langevin eq 3 3  where “Ms” is the saturation magnetization of NCs, “m” is the average magnetic moment of the individual
nanoparticle in the sample, and k is the Boltzmann
constant.27Figure 7 shows the magnetization curves obtained
for CSFZ NCs. All vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) curves (Figure 7) showed a hysteresis
loop with zero coercivity and retentivity values, which exhibit the
super paramagnetic behavior to the synthesized CSFZ nanoparticles.28 On increasing the applied field from −15 000
to 15 000 Oe, the magnetization “M”
increases sharply, and it becomes nearly saturated at 10 000
Oe. The VSM data also confirm that all the prepared samples have strong
magnetic responses to different magnetic fields. The hysteresis loops
showed a smooth change of magnetization with the applied field.29−31 The VSM curves also showed gradual decreases which are due to the
decreasing Fe3+ ion concentrations in the prepared samples
TA1–TA4. In addition to these magnetic properties of the CSFZ
NCs confirmed by VSM analysis, the VSM data show that the magnetic
property is dependent on the composition and the particle size of
the nanoparticles. As we change the composition and particle size
of the nanoparticles, they also change the surface area to ratio volume
which in turn influences magnetization. The CSFZ NCs possess saturation
magnetization (Ms) at 0.5534, 0.3491,
0.3400, and 0.1075 emu/g, for TA1, TA2, TA3, and TA4, respectively.

of Ce4–xSr1+xFe5–xZnxO14+δ (0 ≤ x ≤
0.45) (TA1–TA4).

2.5 Thermal Analysis
To know the thermal
stability, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal
analysis (DTA) are performed on CSFZ NCs (Figure 8). The CSFZ were annealed with the temperature
of 50–1050 °C at 10 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere. Figure 8 shows the TGA and
DTA curves of samples TA1–TA4. All the samples showed a similar
type of TGA curve, with the total weight loss at 1000 °C being
8.30, 9.60, 10.32, and 11.25% for TA1, TA2, TA3, and TA4, respectively.
The first weight loss is observed from ambient temperature to 190
°C, which is associated with the loss of water absorbed in the
solid NCs. However, after that point, the TGA curve does not show
any appreciable changes in the weight loss upto 1000 °C. From
the TGA curves, it is shown that the thermal stability of the samples
decreases from TA1 to TA4. In order to understand the thermal transitions
which can occur during the heat treatment of the sample, differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) is performed on the synthesized NCs. The
DSC curve of the sample is presented in Figure S2. The two endotherm peaks are observed in the ranges of 185–195
and 330–375 °C, which is due to the loss of water which
occurs in two steps.

2.6 Infrared, Raman, and Photoluminescence Studies
The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of the prepared
CSFZ nanoparticles is shown in Figure S3. From the IR spectrum, it is confirmed that the peak that appears
at 515 cm–1 is due to Zn–O and the peak at
445 cm–1 is due to the Ce–O bond stretching.
The weak absorbance at 570 and 415 cm–1 is due to
the Fe–O and Sr–O bond stretching, respectively.32−35 From this IR result, it is evident that the prepared NC is in the
form of corresponding metal oxides.

The Raman spectrum of the
CSFZ NC is shown in Figure S4. The spectrum
consists of a strong band at 465 cm–1 which corresponds
to the F2g vibrational mode of the Ce–O8 bond. In the case of Fe2O3, totally, seven
modes (Γ = 2A1g + 5Eg) of vibrations are
expected, 225 and 498 cm–1 band due to 2A1g mode, band at 247, 293, 299, 412, and 613 cm–1 due to 5Eg modes of vibration, but the 1A1g mode of vibration observed in the region of 223–225 cm–1 and 1Eg mode of vibration observed in
the region of 610–614 cm–1. For Zn–O,
totally eight modes of vibration (Γ = 2A1 + 2B1 + 2E1 + 2E2)
are possible; from this, six remain active (2A1 + 2E1 + 2E2) and 2B1
is Raman inactive. The additional weak peak is observed because of
A1g + Eg + T2g vibration modes of
SrO. The sharp band 620 cm–1 is due to the A1g mode of SrO vibration, and very weak band 707 cm–1 (TO + LO) is due to Eglow Eghigh modes of SrO. T2g modes are not observed because of the
very low intensity. The intensity of the peak at 465 cm–1 in the Raman spectrum decreases with the decrease in the concentration
of Ce2O3. Similarly, the Fe2O3 peak intensity decreases from TA4 to TA1 because of the decrease
in the concentration of Fe2O3, and also the
peak showed a red shift in the Raman spectrum.36−38 Further, the
observed Raman band value confirms that the formed NCs are in the
form of monoclinic symmetry.

A photoluminescence (PL) study
was carried out to measure the light
emission property of the NCs TA1–TA4. Figure S5 displays the PL spectra of TA1–TA4. The decrease
in the PL emission intensity is due to the low recombination rate
of electrons and holes under the light irradiation. The highest PL
emission intensity may indicate the highest recombination of electrons
and holes. The characteristic PL strong peaks observed at 376 nm are
due to 5d–4f transition of Ce3+ ions.39 Another strong peak observed at 412 nm is due
to the transition of 6A1–4E1, 4A1(G4) Fe3+ ions. The low intensity broad-band peak observed is due to the double
excitation process of strongly coupled Fe3+ ions rather
than the single Fe3+ ions as stated by the transition [6A1 + 6A1 ]–[4T1(G4) + 4T1(G4)], while the broad-band 433 nm emission band is suggested because
of the presence of many point defects,40 such as oxygen vacancies in CSFZ composite structures. The perfect
blue emission peak observed at 468 nm is due to SrO. The expected
PL emission bands in the region of 407 nm for ZnO are masked because
of the presence of the broad band around 412 nm.

2.7 Dielectric Studies
The complex impedance
spectroscopy is a nondestructive tool for characterization of electrical
properties. The electrical property of the CSFZ NCs containing different
metal compositions (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.45) is
studied using the impedance analyzer which is operated at the frequency
range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz. Figure 9 shows the impedance, dielectric constant, dielectric loss,
and log(F) versus log(σ) spectrums of TA1–TA4.
This impedance plot shows typical single depressed semicircle behavior.
In this semicircle, the diameter decreases with a decrease in the
concentration of Ce and Fe in the NCs.30−32 The calculated bulk
conductivity value (σb) of the NCs increases with
a decrease in the Fe and Ce concentration.

Figure 9 Dielectric curves of
Ce4–xSr1+xFe5–xZnxO14+δ (0 ≤ x ≤
0.45).

Figure 9 shows the
dielectric constant graph as a function of frequency. The graph shows
a high dielectric constant value at the lower frequency region, and
at a higher frequency range, the dielectric constant becomes a constant
value.42,43 The observed pattern clearly shows that
the dielectric properties of the compound decreases with increase
in the average particle size of the system. The values of the dielectric
loss and dielectric constant of the samples are listed in Table 2. The higher value
of the dielectric constant has been attributed to the effect of heterogeneity
of the samples. According to Koop’s theory,44 frequency plays an important role in the dielectric constant.
As frequency increases, the dielectric constant decreases, which can
be explained on the basis of the space-charge polarization effect.
The dielectric constant is found to be constant at elevated frequency
because of the electronic polarizability.45

2.8 Drug Encapsulation and
Release Experiments
The encapsulated amount was measured
by using UV–visible
spectroscopy at the absorbance of 276 nm (Figure 10). The quantity of encapsulation was found
to be 45% (4.14 mg/10 mg of particles). Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride
(CFH) has a pKa value of 6.09 for carboxylic
acid groups and a pKb value of 8.74 for
nitrogen on the piperazinyl ring. Because the synthesized NCs have
a positive surface potential of about +100 mV, we believe that the
major driving force for encapsulation is physical adsorption (i.e.,
surface adsorption and loading into the core via pore diffusion).
The rate of drug release is significantly influenced by the particle
size as the encapsulated drug from the interior has to move to the
surface, and then to the liquid. As a result, the drug release from
smaller-sized NCs, which have a small core and high surface area to
volume ratio, is at a faster rate than that of larger-sized NCs.41 As the larger-sized NCs have large cores, it
allows more drugs to be encapsulated per particle and gives the ability
to control the release in a sustained manner.46,47 Thus, the control of particle size provides a method of tuning drug
release rates from the NCs.

Figure 10 Drug releasing studies of the Ce4–xSr1+xFe5–xZnxO14+δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.45) (TA1–TA4).

The drug release profiles for
different systems (TA1, TA2, TA3,
and TA4) were estimated in water at pH 7.4. In general, the following two factors are mainly responsible in releasing the drug molecules
from the NPs: (a) normal pore diffusion via surface pores due to concentration
gradient and (b) charge screening in drug–NP interactions (e.g.,
ionic interactions). Because there is no involvement of ionic interactions,
we believe that only the diffusion process controls the release process.
Drug release occurs in two stages; (i) diffusion of surface-adsorbed
drug molecules (burst release) and (ii) diffusion of drug molecules
that are loaded in the inner core of the NPs (sustained release).
In all the cases, the drug release was found to occur in two phases,
first disintegrate release and then persistent release over a period
of 10 h. The burst release in the first 1 h occurs because of the
release of the drug present on the surface of the NPs. The burst drug
release behavior is often observed for the spherically symmetrical
systems and is inevitable.48 From 2 h onward,
the release was observed in a sustained manner and continued up to
10 h. The total release was found to be 99% (i.e., 50% via burst release
and 49% via sustained release).

3 Conclusions
NCs of the formula Ce4–xSr1+xFe5–xZnxO14+δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.45) (TA1–TA4: x = 0,
0.15, 0.30, and 0.45) are prepared by the nitrate–citrate gel
route. XRD analysis shows that the prepared nanomaterial exists as
a single-phase material. SEM images show that the prepared NC has
the particles with irregular shapes of nanoflakes and nanoclusters.
Most of the particle size present in the image is in the range of
5–10 nm. EDX analysis results confirmed that the prepared material
contains Ce, Sr, Fe, Zn, and O with appropriate ratios expected from
the experiment. The optical studies confirm the simultaneous presence
of both Fe3+ and Fe2+ intervalence electronic
charge transition band. The peak at 753 nm may be assigned to the
transition state 6A1g(S) to 4T1g(G) state of the Fe3+ ion. Preliminary VSM spectra
show that the CSFZ NC is in a single domain and perfectly super paramagnetic
in nature at room temperature. From the TGA curves, it is confirmed
that the thermal stability of the samples decreases upon decreasing
the Ce–O and Fe–O concentration in the sample. The Raman
spectrum shows that the changes in the band structure are due to the
change in the particle size. From the PL spectrum, it is confirmed
that the prepared sample has lower photoemission property which leads
to NCs should have been higher photocatalytic property. The drug encapsulation
in CSFZ NCs was found to be 45%. The release was observed in two phases
and continued up to 10 h. Thus, the NPs reported here have high potential
for use as drug delivery carriers.

4.2 Characterization
Particle size and
crystallinity of the synthesized CSFZ composites are estimated using
the powder XRD method (Siemens D5005 diffractometer) using Cu Kα
(λ = 0.154178 nm) radiation in the range 10°–80°
in 2θ. Microstructure studies are carried out using SEM model
Hitachi-S3400. EDX analysis is done with a super Dryer-II model analyzer.
The presence of element and its oxidization state is determined by
an XPS ESCA-3 Mark II spectrometer (VG Scientific Ltd, England) using
Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation as the source. The room temperature
of optical absorption spectra is measured in the region of 200–800
nm using a UV–visible spectrometer (LAB INDIA model UV 320).
An ALPHA Bruker FT-IR spectrophotometer is used to find the metal
oxide bonding interaction by the KBr pellet method. The thermal response
of the synthesized CSFZ composites is done by using DTA and TGA recorded
at Q600 SDT instruments. DSC is recorded using Q20 DSC instruments
with the operating temperature range of 50–1050 °C. VSM
is recorded by using the VSM model Lake Shore’s new 7400 series
instrument. The internal structure of prepared CSFZ composites is
analyzed by TEM analysis (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2010, Japan). The scattering
property of the prepared CSFZ composites is measured by Raman spectra
(Renishaw micro-Raman system). Dielectric properties of the CSFZ composites
are recorded by using Solartron electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(SI model no. 1260, 100 mV; 0.01 Hz to 7 MHz). The PL analysis is
carried out using a UV-spectrophotometer model Fluorolog-3 (HORIBA
Jobin Yvon, Japan).

4.3 Synthesis of Ce4–xSr1+xFe5–xZnxO14+δ [0 ≤ x ≤ 0.45] Composite
The CSFZ composite is
prepared using the procedure which is available in the literature,22 and the flow chart of the synthetic strategy
is presented in Scheme 1. There are four combinations (TA1–TA4) of metals used in
the synthesis of nano metal oxide, and the details about the synthesized
different combinations of NCs are presented in Table 3. The required amount of hydrated ceriumnitrate
[Ce(NO3)3·6H2O], hydrated strontiunitrate
[Sr(NO3)2·5H2O], hydrated ferricnitrate
[Fe(NO3)3·9H2O], and hydrated
zincnitrate [Zn(NO3)2·6H2O]
are used for the synthesis of Ce4–xSr1+xFe5–xZnxO14+δ [0 ≤ x ≤ 0.45] oxide. All precursor solutions are diluted
to 0.1 M s and taken into a 1000 mL beaker to be stirred for about
30 min to get a homogeneous solution. Citric acid (35 mL) is then
added to this homogeneous solution as a complexing agent, and stirring
is continued for 62 h at 60 °C. The solution is allowed to slowly
evaporate with constant stirring to get a gel. The prepared gel is
decomposed into a coarse powder by using a heating mantle at 100 °C
for 30 min, and then the sample is annealed at 650 °C for 4 h
in a furnace. The obtained dark brown powder is quenched in air to
get a partially crystalline compound.23

4.4 Encapsulation of CFH into the NCs
NC powder (10 mg)
is dispersed in 2 mL of water in centrifuge tubes
and ultrasonicated for 2 min to obtain uniformly dispersed nanoparticle
suspension. The suspension is then centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 10
min and triple washed with water. CFH solution (2 mL, 5 mg/mL) is
added to the CSFZ composites at acidic conditions (pH 5) and incubated
for 1 h at ordinary temperature. After incubation, the suspension
was centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 10 min, and supernatant absorbance
is measured at 276 nm using a ND-2000c UV spectrophotometer (Nanodrop
Technologies, USA). The actual amount of drug loading is calculated
by subtracting the amount of drugs present in the supernatant from
the original amount used for the encapsulation process. After the
encapsulation process, the drug-loaded NC powder is washed twice with
water and used for release experiments. The encapsulation efficiency
(EE) is calculated by using eq 4 4  

4.5 In Vitro Drug Release Experiments
The in vitro drug
release study for the systems TA1, TA2, TA3, and
TA4 is analyzed by incubating drug-loaded NCs in 2 mL of triple distilled
water at 37 °C. Drug-loaded NCs (10 mg) are dispersed in 2 mL
of water in a centrifuge and placed in an incubator shaker at 37 °C.
At a particular time period, 1.4 mL of the sample is extracted from
the centrifuge tube and charged with an equal quantity of prewarmed
water in such a way that the mechanical equilibrium does not get disturbed
during the evaluation process. The amount of CFH released is calculated
by measuring the increase in absorbance values at 276 nm using UV
spectroscopy.
