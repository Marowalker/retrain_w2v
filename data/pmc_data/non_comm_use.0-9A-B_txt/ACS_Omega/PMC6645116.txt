Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposite
materials were studied as bifunctional systems for depuration of wastewater.
They are able to efficiently adsorb and decompose rhodamine B (RhB)
and methyl orange (MO), used as model pollutants. Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposites
were synthesized at room temperature and ambient pressure by means
of controlled hydrolysis of BiCl3 in the presence of a
surfactant (Brij 76). Cold treatments of the pristine samples with
UV light or thermal annealing at different temperatures (370–500
°C) and atmospheres (air, Ar/30% O2) were adopted
to modulate the relative amounts of Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 and hence the morphology,
surface area, ζ-potential, optical absorption in the visible
range, and the adsorption/degradation of pollutants. The best performance
was achieved by (BiO)2CO3-rich samples, which
adsorbed 80% of MO and decomposed the remaining 20% by visible light
photocatalysis. Irrespective of the dye, all of the samples were able
to almost complete the adsorption step within 10 min contact time.
Bi12O17Cl2-rich composite materials
displayed a lower adsorption ability, but thanks to the stronger absorption
in the visible range they behaved as more effective photocatalysts.
The obtained results evidenced the ability of the employed strategy
to modulate sample properties in a wide range, thus pointing out the
effectiveness of this approach for the synthesis of multifunctional
inorganic materials for environmental remediation.

==== Body
Introduction
The
interest toward multifunctional materials has continuously
increased over the last few years. Materials capable of pollutant
adsorption and degradation at the same time are highly desirable for
environmental remediation strategies. Among the most widespread pollutants,
dyes represent a considerable portion because they are employed in
different areas, including textile, dyeing, paper and pulp, tannery
and paint industries. It has been reported that 10–15% of industrial
dyes are lost through wastes.1 They are
considered as particularly offensive pollutants because of their toxicity
due to oral ingestion, inhalation, skin and eye irritation, and carcinogenicity.2−5 Even in low amounts, they may impart color to water. This not only
is unpleasant but also affects the transmission of light, thus distressing
biological metabolism and leading to destruction of the aquatic communities.6,7 Moreover, dyes are able to strongly bond heavy metals, causing microtoxicity
to fish and other organisms.7

For
these reasons, the development of strategies to rapidly remove
this class of contaminants from wastewater and/or for their degradation
is a fundamental target for environmental protection and remediation.
In general, dyes are very difficult to remove because most of them
are resistant to several depuration methods.8−14 On the contrary, adsorption has been demonstrated to be a suitable
and effective approach, owing to the simplicity in processing design,
easiness in working conditions, low cost and low energy requirements,
and insensitivity to toxic substances.15 In this framework, an innovative approach consists in the development
of bifunctional materials endowed with strong adsorption properties
and also able to carry out an efficient and complete degradation of
the contaminants. In this regard, a wide variety of materials have
been tested as dye adsorbents in aqueous solution.16−19 Most of them, however, have low
adsorption capacities or require rather long contact time, up to some
days. Therefore, to develop effective adsorbent systems, these problems
must be overcome. On the other hand, photocatalysis represents an
intriguing solution among green technologies, and it has attracted
extensive interest in the fields of water splitting and pollutant
degradation.20−23 In particular, TiO2 has been recognized as a benchmark
photocatalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants in water and
wastewater.24−26 However, the use of titanium oxide and conventional
semiconductor photocatalysts is limited by their wide band gap and
because they respond only to UV light, which corresponds to less than
5% of sunlight energy.9 Hence, a further
challenge is represented by the development of highly visible light-driven
photocatalysts to take advantage of the whole solar radiation spectrum.

Over the last few years, bismuthyl ion (BiO+) based
nanostructures have been studied to develop new adsorbent–photocatalytic
systems owing to their peculiar physicochemical properties, layered
structures, morphologies, and low toxicity.27−38 In particular, bismuth oxyhalogenides (BiOX, X = Cl, Br, I, and
their mixtures) and bismuth subcarbonate, (BiO)2CO3, nanostructures displayed encouraging performances. Besides
BiOCl, further bismuth oxychlorides with different stoichiometry,
such as Bi24O31Cl10, Bi3O4Cl, Bi12O17Cl2, etc.,
are possible.39 All of them are characterized
by layered structures; can be synthesized with different shapes, that
is, nanosheets and nanoflakes; and are active as both adsorbent and
photocatalytic materials. Notably, the visible light absorption increases
with a decrease in the chlorine content. Besides the single oxychlorides
or subcarbonate, the BiOCl/Bi2O3, BiOCl/BiOI,
and BiOI/Bi12O17Cl2 composite systems
that display heterojunction structures can operate far better than
the single components thanks to the presence of synergic effects at
the interface between the two phases.30,40−42 In these structures, oxygen-rich oxychlorides, like for example
Bi12O17Cl2, and oxyhalides containing
Br and I are used as sensitizers to harvest the visible light, and
their effect is particularly important when coupled to materials with
low to no visible absorption, as BiOCl and (BiO)2CO3, to form the heterojunction. In this regard, the present
study explores the modulation of optical and dye adsorption/photodegradation
properties of Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposite materials by tailoring the relative
amount of the two components.

The inorganic composites were
prepared by a soft solution method
and subsequent postsynthesis treatments (thermal and cold UV-light-assisted)
to modulate their properties and hence their dye absorption–degradation
capability. These functional properties are affected by several factors
correlated to both bulk and surface characteristics of the materials.
To fully characterize the materials, we employed powder X-ray diffraction,
Raman spectroscopy, optical absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). Sample morphology was explored by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). Finally, the adsorption capacity (AC) and degradation
activity of the Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposite materials under visible light
irradiation were tested toward rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange
(MO), which are largely adopted models for cationic and anionic dyes,
respectively.

Results and Discussion
The as-prepared
(AP) and treated materials were characterized by
powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Despite the employed mild
synthesis conditions (e.g., low temperature and atmospheric pressure)
and the absence of any thermal treatment, as-prepared samples showed
a pattern with multiple diffraction peaks (Figure 1a). The whole set of peaks can be indexed
according to two tetragonal phases Bi12O17Cl2 (JCPDS card no. 37-0702) and (BiO)2CO3 (bismutite, JCPDS card no. 41-1488).

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns of as-prepared
and treated Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposite
materials. Peculiar diffraction peaks of (BiO)2CO3 (▼) and Bi12O17Cl2 (□)
tetragonal phases are labeled. (b) Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
of the as-prepared sample.

As-prepared samples were preliminarily studied by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) to investigate their behavior under heating in air.
Indeed, the determination of the specimen response to thermal treatments
is important in view of the preparation of pure inorganic nanosystems,
with the aim of defining suitable annealing conditions.

The
TGA curve of the AP sample (Figure 1b) shows an initial weight decrease below
200 °C, which is assigned to the loss of water adsorbed on the
surface of the crude powders. From 200 to 450 °C, we correlate
the weight loss to the degradation of the residual surfactant. At
a higher temperature, between 450 and 800 °C, we observe weight
invariance, whereas the weight loss above 800 °C is attributed
to the formation of bismuth oxide. Different postsynthesis treatments
were conducted on as-prepared samples, to completely remove the surfactant
molecules and to modulate the Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 ratio in the nanocomposite
materials, the morphology, and the light absorption. We performed
thermal treatments at 500 °C in air for 1 h, which is close to
the lowest temperature for the complete surfactant decomposition.
It is well-known that high annealing temperatures are apt to reduce
the material surface areas that are important parameters for both
adsorption and photodegradation properties. For this reason, we also
adopted lower annealing temperatures and increased the treatment duration
to aid surfactant degradation and to hamper surface area reduction.
To this purpose, we performed the following treatments: (i) at 420
°C for 6 h with a slow heating ramp and (ii) at 370 °C for
6 h in an oxygen-rich atmosphere (O2 30% in Ar) to assist
the decomposition of the organic moieties that in air at this temperature
is not complete (Figure 1b). Moreover, we also carried out a cold annealing procedure by means
of UV irradiation at room temperature (up to 14 h) with a medium-pressure
Hg lamp. The details of all of the employed treatments are reported
in Experimental Section (Table 2).

Postsynthesis treatments
strongly influence the nanocomposite structure.
The diffraction patterns (Figure 1a) of the annealed samples consist of partially overlapped
peaks belonging to (BiO)2CO3 and Bi12O17Cl2 crystal phases. The strong narrow peak
around 33° can be indexed as 200 of Bi12O17Cl2 as well as 110 of (BiO)2CO3.
Both Bi12O17Cl2 and (BiO)2CO3 present the typical layered structure of many BiO+ compounds. (BiO)2CO3 belongs to the
family of Sillén phases in which [Bi2O2]2+ layers are interleaved with carbonate groups oriented
orthogonally to the metal oxide slabs.43−45 On the other hand, in
Bi12O17Cl2, chlorine single layers
are interleaved with metal oxide sheets.39,46−48 After annealing, a change in the relative phase amount
of Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 was observed. In fact, the T37O2 sample was characterized
mainly by the (BiO)2CO3 phase, showing the characteristic
002, 011, and 013 reflexes at 12.8, 23.9, and 30.3°, respectively
(Figure 1a). Thus,
annealing in an O2-rich atmosphere stabilizes the bismuth
subcarbonate phase at the expense of the chlorinated one. Thermal
treatment in air at 420 °C (6 h) led to the formation of nanocomposites
rich in Bi12O17Cl2, and after a fast
annealing at 500 °C (1 h, steep heating), (BiO)2CO3-related signals were no longer detectable in the diffraction
pattern. Finally, prolonged
cold UV treatments (14 h) on as-prepared samples resulted in the formation
of nanocomposites with (BiO)2CO3 as the main
crystalline phase. In the diffraction pattern of UV samples, the peaks
are broader compared to those of all of the other samples, suggesting
a lower crystallinity and/or the copresence of tiny crystallites of
both Bi12O17Cl2 and (BiO)2CO3.

The structural features of the various materials
obtained by the
different annealing procedures were also observed in the Raman spectra
(Figure 2). For the
UV-treated sample we observed a simple spectrum characterized by a
single peak at 163 cm–1 closely matching that of
commercial (BiO)2CO3. The band is associated
with external vibration modes of (BiO)2CO3,45,49 which is the predominant crystal phase in these samples, as indicated
by XRD. Moreover, the broad peak shape, already observed in the XRD
pattern, suggests the presence of structural disorder. In all thermally
treated specimens, additional Raman signals at 96, 474, and 600 cm–1, attributed to Bi12O17Cl2, were also detected.

Figure 2 (a) Raman spectra of Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposite materials
subjected
to different annealing procedures. Peaks belonging to Bi12O17Cl2 and (BiO)2CO3 are
indexed in the figure. (b) Low-frequency Raman spectra. Commercial
(BiO)2CO3 is used as a reference, and it is
displayed in both panels.

These findings are confirmed by the analysis of the low-frequency
region of the Raman spectra. Indeed, only the peaks related to the
Bi12O17Cl2 phase occur below 40 cm–1, and we clearly observe them at ca. 9, 20, and 33
cm–1. Compared with XRD patterns, which show many
overlapped signals, Raman spectra are simpler and provide a more precise
representation of the system evolution. The observed variations are
due to differences in composition and the overall spectral shape derives
from the overlap of the spectra of the pure components weighted for
their amount. We determined the relative phase composition
in the different samples by evaluating (eq 1) the ratio between the integrated area of
peaks at 96 and 163 cm–1, belonging to Bi12O17Cl2 and (BiO)2CO3,
respectively. In this way, we estimated the effect of the different
treatments on the relative amount of Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Relative composition
of Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposite materials subjected
to different treatments determined from Raman spectra (eq 1).

We found that the ratio between Bi12O17Cl2 and (BiO)2CO3 is ca. 1 for AP
and T42
samples. At variance, after the fast annealing at 500 °C, the
relative composition is 100% Bi12O17Cl2 (Figure 3), which
turns to 100% (BiO)2CO3 after prolonged cold
UV treatment. These findings highlight that the selected annealing
procedures allow us to modulate the sample
composition in a wide range.

The capability of the employed
UV procedure to produce materials
containing high amounts of (BiO)2CO3 can be
rationalized taking into account the nature of the treatment. Basically,
it is a photocatalytic reaction promoted by UV light that leads to
the decomposition of surfactant molecules. Among all of the possible
decomposition species of organic compounds, carbon dioxide is usually
formed, and it is likely that the bismuth subcarbonate phase is obtained
by reaction of CO2 with the inorganic matrix. Moreover,
because the UV treatments were conducted on aqueous dispersions of
the samples, the presence of water hampers the removal of CO2 from the catalyst and promotes the formation of HCO3– and CO32– species. At
variance, short thermal treatments (1 h) at 500 °C and steep
heating/cooling steps allow the fast removal of the surfactant pyrolysis
products from the reaction environment, thus favoring the formation
of inorganic compounds free from carbon-containing phases.

Specific
surface area (SSA) and sample morphologies are important
parameters being directly related to the adsorption capability. All
samples showed surface area values up to few tenths of square meters
per gram of catalyst, which are typical values for BiO+-based materials29,40,41,50 (Table 1). In particular, the UV sample reaches the highest
values, 21 m2 g–1, whereas commercial
(BiO)2CO3 shows a SSA value 1 order of magnitude
lower.

Different
morphologies were observed especially by employing the
fast treatment at 500 °C and UV radiation. As shown in Figure 4a,b, AP samples were
characterized by the presence of randomly oriented aggregates of irregular
shape, constituted by very thin flakes, few nanometers thick and hundreds
of nanometers wide.

Figure 4 SEM images of AP (a, b); T50 (c, d); and UV (e, f) samples.

By applying thermal treatments
at increasing temperature, up to
420 °C, substantial differences from as-prepared samples were
not observed. Instead, for the T50 sample (Figure 4c,d), a highly homogeneous distribution of
very thin flakes of similar dimensions (a hundred of nanometer wide)
was observed. Flakes coalescence has not been detected despite the
high temperature and the steep heating time. Furthermore, samples
subjected to UV light irradiation displayed an even more different
morphology, characterized by a spongy texture. In Figure 4e,f, micrometric aggregates
constituted by randomly orientated thin flakes one hundred nanometers
wide can be appreciated.

The relative composition of Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposite materials is
directly correlated with the optical properties, and its modulation
allows the tuning of light absorption. In particular, sustainable
strategies in environmental remediation require materials that absorb
in the visible range to exploit solar radiation. In this regard, samples
characterized by high amounts of Bi12O17Cl2 presented a high absorption in the visible range (Figure 5), which instead
decreased when the subcarbonate phase was predominant. Indeed, Bi12O17Cl2 and (BiO)2CO3 are characterized by absorption edges localized around 520
and 400 nm, respectively.51−53 Interestingly, the UV sample
for which chlorinated phases were not detected (Figures 1a and 2) shows an
absorption spectrum characterized by a long tail in the visible range.
A similar feature, usually not observable in the spectra of pure and
single-phase (BiO)2CO3, is attributed to the
presence of defects and low- or noncrystalline materials not detectable
with XRD and Raman spectroscopy.

of as-prepared and treated
Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposite materials.

In adsorption–degradation processes, the material
surface
plays a paramount role. In this regard, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
gives qualitative and quantitative information on the species present
on the sample surface.

The survey spectra of all samples showed
Bi, O, Cl, and C characteristic
peaks (in Figure 6a,
the AP sample is reported). The Bi4f high-resolution spectrum (inset Figure 6a) displayed two
intense peaks at binding energy (BE) = 159.0 and 164.3 eV, which can
be assigned to the j = 7/2 and 5/2 components of
bismuth in the +3 oxidation state.54,55

Figure 6 XPS spectra:
(a) wide scan (survey) and high-resolution Bi4f peak
(inset); (b) C1s high-resolution spectra of the AP, T50, and UV samples.

On the surface of both UV and
T50 samples, carbonate- and Cl–-related signals
were observed by XPS, evidencing the
copresence of bismuth subcarbonate- and oxychloride-related species
not detected by XRD and Raman spectroscopy (Figures 1a and 2). In this
regard, it is noteworthy that XRD is sensitive only to crystalline
materials and the features of Raman spectra, that is, peak intensity
and width, strongly depend on sample crystallinity. Concerning UV
samples, chlorine-containing species observed by XPS contributed to
the shape of the Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposite absorption spectrum characterized
by a shoulder in the visible range (λ > 400 nm, Figure 5).

The presence
of carbonates is confirmed by C1s high-resolution
spectra. Moreover, the carbon signal gives clear indication of the
annealing treatment effectiveness on the achievement of a pure inorganic
material. In particular, the C1s photoelectron peak of AP samples
showed a broad profile due to the presence of multiple species. This
is not surprising because, as previously discussed (Figure 1), crude samples still contain
surfactant molecules. The component at a lower BE (I, Figure 6b) can be assigned to adventitious
carbon (BE = 284.8 eV) and to the aliphatic residues of the surfactant.54,56 The two components centered at 286.7 and 288.7 eV are, respectively,
ascribed to ether groups (II, Figure 6b) of the residual surfactant and to carbonate groups
(III, Figure 6b). In
fact, the employed highly alkaline synthesis conditions can favor
carbonation of the solution through reaction with atmospheric CO2. At variance, after thermal and UV light treatments, the
efficient removal of the residual surfactant was achieved as pointed
out by the disappearance of the signals related to the surfactant
moiety (Figure 6b).

The capability of the nanomaterials to purify dye-containing water,
through pollutants’ adsorption and their successive degradation
with visible light, was evaluated by dispersing the sample in an aqueous
solution containing rhodamine B or methyl orange. Adsorption is a
physical process, in which dye molecules are adsorbed on the photocatalyst
surface to reach an adsorption–desorption equilibrium before
irradiation. Commonly, the adsorption of dye molecules on the photocatalyst
surface is a precondition for the degradation reaction. We performed
the adsorption–decomposition experiments on the whole set of
samples, but we observed that the activity of T42 and T37O2 specimens was considerably lower than that of T50 and UV. Besides
compositional factors, this behavior is presumably affected also by
the low SSA values of T42 and T37O2 (see Table 1). For this reason, we focused
our attention and the following discussion on the samples showing
higher SSA values, for example, T50 and UV specimens.

In general,
the dye-adsorption process consists of three steps:
(i) a fast initial regime that strongly depends on electric attraction
between the adsorbate and the clean surface of the adsorbent, (ii)
a slow step that can last from several minutes up to 1 h and depends
on both electrostatic attraction between the adsorbate and the partially
covered surface and the reorganization of the adsorbed molecules,
and (iii) achievement of the adsorption/desorption equilibrium.57,58

Figure 7 shows
the
dye-adsorption kinetics in the dark normalized for the material surface
area for UV and T50 samples. In both cases, the adsorption process
is rather fast and almost complete after the first 10 min, pointing
out the effectiveness of these materials to quickly eliminate the
pollutants from the solution. The solution fading due to dye adsorption
is visible also to the naked eye, as evidenced in the pictures reported
in Figure 7. UV samples
are more effective in adsorbing both the dyes. Moreover, the results
indicate that T50 exhibits a slightly higher adsorption of the anionic
MO with respect to that of the cationic RhB, whereas the differences
for UV are significantly higher.

Figure 7 Time dependence of the adsorption of RhB
and MO over T50 and UV
samples in the dark. The pictures illustrate the solution fading due
to dye adsorption.

The observed adsorption
behavior can be interpreted considering
the values of ζ-potential for T50 (+27 mV) and UV (−12
mV), respectively. In particular, ζ-potentials of opposite charges
can induce different material–dye interactions.

MO is
negatively charged at the working pH and contains an azo
group (−N=N−) that links the aromatic C-atoms
and hence it is easily adsorbed on the positively charged surface
(T50). Conversely, RhB is a cationic dye containing a carboxyl group
that under the adopted reaction conditions can be partially present
in its basic form and therefore it is able to interact in the zwitterionic
form with the surface of T50.

The higher adsorption of MO on
UV samples may be partially related
to specific surface features. In particular, the negative ζ-potential
could be associated with the presence of OH– groups
adsorbed on the material surface.59,60 Therefore,
the anionic MO molecules can be effectively adsorbed by UV samples
by the ligand exchange reaction with the surface-adsorbed OH− groups.29

The photocatalytic activity
of the different materials was evaluated
in solution toward the decoloration of RhB and MO, under irradiation
with visible light. According to literature conditions,61,62 because of the degradation resistance of MO, the amount of the photocatalyst
used was higher than that in the case of RhB. For adsorption studies,
the photoactivity was
evaluated on the most promising materials and compared to that of
commercial (BiO)2CO3.

In Figure 8, the
adsorption capacity (AC, calculated according to eq 2) and the decoloration efficiency (DE, calculated
according to eq 3) for
RhB are reported. The UV-treated samples have both the highest AC
and DE. In fact, they are able to adsorb more than 6 mg g–1 RhB (Figure 8a),
whereas the reference sample and T50 do not reach an AC value of 5
mg g–1. For the thermally treated sample, RhB adsorption
of ca. 20% (Figure 8b) was observed after the
equilibrium was reached between the dye and the adsorbent in the dark
(45 min). Then, under irradiation with visible light, another 40%
of the organic dye is degraded with a slow but steady rate. After
180 min of reaction, a total decoloration efficiency of 60% was achieved.
The UV sample, consisting of a subcarbonate-rich Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposite,
showed a much stronger dye adsorption up to 50% (Figure 8b) in the first 45 min. Subsequently,
after 180 min of irradiation, it was able to decolorize all of the
remaining RhB present in the solution.

Figure 8 a) Adsorption capacity
of the T50 and UV samples and commercial
(BiO)2CO3 in the presence of RhB. (b) Photocatalytic
activity of the samples toward the decoloration efficiency of rhodamine
B.

Taking into account the absorption
spectra of the different samples
at λ > 400 nm (Figure 5), it is reasonable to suppose that the photodegradation activity
toward RhB, under visible irradiation, consists mainly in a combination
between (i) indirect photosensitization of the catalyst through the
dye and (ii) direct photoexcitation of the catalyst. The balance between
these two processes is governed by the relative amount of Bi12O17Cl2 in the Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposite materials
because it has the higher visible light absorption.

The adsorption
capacity of the UV samples toward MO (Figure 9a) is more than 3 times larger
than that of the other two materials and reaches the value of 4.3
mg g–1. At equilibrium, about 80% of MO was adsorbed
from the solution, and after 60 min of irradiation, only 3.5% of MO
was still present in the solution. The T50 sample showed a lower MO-adsorption
capacity (25%), but it was able to degrade around 55% of MO in 180
min (total DE 80%). Instead, the commercial (BiO)2CO3 is almost inactive.

Figure 9 a) Adsorption capacity of different samples
in the presence of
MO. (b) Photocatalytic activity of the samples toward the decoloration
of methyl orange.

To determine the stability
and recyclability of the catalysts,
we performed a set of cyclic tests using the same samples in successive
runs. The decoloration efficiency curves (Figure 10) did not show noticeable variations after
each of the three cycles, evidencing a stable photocatalytic activity
for both UV and T50 samples.

for the photocatalytic reaction of T50 and UV samples toward MO and
RhB.

In summary, UV samples represent
promising bifunctional materials
because they combine fast and significant dye-adsorption capacity
with the ability to photodegrade the dyes under visible irradiation.
Moreover, they perform very well with both anionic and cationic molecules.
In particular, the cold UV light treatment allows us to preserve a
reasonably high surface area and a suitable morphology and surface
composition that guarantee a better adsorbent behavior compared to
that of the thermally treated samples. Nonetheless, the T50 sample,
despite its lower adsorption capacity, can also be considered as an
interesting bifunctional material, especially toward MO. In fact,
the weaker MO-adsorption capability is compensated by a significant
photodegradation activity.

Conclusions
This study shows that
postsynthesis treatments represent a powerful
tool for the modulation of the chemicophysical and functional properties
of Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposite materials obtained by soft solution procedures.
Accordingly, a variation of their performances as adsorbents and photocatalysts
toward selected cationic (RhB) and anionic (MO) organic dyes can be
achieved. Fast treatments at high temperature (up to 500 °C)
favor the formation of the Bi12O17Cl2-rich nanocomposite, whereas the (BiO)2CO3-rich
nanocomposites were obtained after UV light irradiation. The latter
displayed the most promising functional performances with an adsorption
capacity of 6.0 and 4.3 mg g–1 in 60 min toward
RhB and MO, respectively. The majority of the adsorption (80%) occurs
within the first 10 min of contact with the dyes. Interestingly, thanks
to their visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity UV samples were
also able to contribute to degradation of RhB. The increased content
of Bi12O17Cl2 in the Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposite
materials slightly reduced the adsorption performance toward RhB (5
mg g–1), whereas it significantly affects the MO-adsorption
capacity (1.5 mg g–1). However, thanks to the stronger
absorption in the visible range Bi12O17Cl2-rich composite materials are more efficient photocatalysts.

The obtained results evidenced the ability of the employed strategy
to modulate sample properties in a wide range, thus pointing out the
effectiveness of this approach for the synthesis of multifunctional
inorganic materials for environmental remediation. In particular,
among the different adopted procedures, cold treatment with UV light
on crude Bi12O17Cl2/(BiO)2CO3 nanocomposites guarantees relatively fast and high
dye-adsorption capacity and maintains photocatalytic degradation activity
under sustainable visible light conditions even after successive working
cycles.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
All chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich
and used as received. Syntheses were conducted under mild conditions
in aqueous solution in the presence of Brij 76 as a surfactant. Solution
A was obtained by dissolving BiCl3 (0.2 M) in a HCl/ethanol
solution (0.5 M) at room temperature, whereas solution B was prepared
by mixing Brij 76 (1 wt %) and HCl (0.6 M) at 65 °C. Solution
A was added to solution B (volume ratio 1:15), and the resulting mixture
was aged 5 h at 65 °C under continuous and vigorous stirring.
The raw powders were precipitated with an excess of LiOH (2.0 M),
collected by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol, and finally
dried in air. Thermal or cold UV treatments were conducted on the
as-prepared samples. In particular, the following annealing procedures
were performed: (i) 1 h at 500 °C in air (sample inserted and
removed in temperature); (ii) 6 h at 420 °C in air (heating ramp
0.5 °C min−1); and (iii) 6 h at 370 °C
in O2 30% in Ar (heating ramp 0.5 °C min−1). UV treatments at room temperature were conducted by dispersing
the powders in aqueous solution and irradiating the mixture with a
medium-pressure Hg lamp (450 W) for 14 h. To verify the complete removal
of surfactant after the UV procedure, temperature-programmed oxidation
experiments were conducted after the above-mentioned treatments to
check the presence of residual organic contaminants.

Table 2 summarizes the treatments carried out on as-prepared powders
and their corresponding sample labels.

Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA)
TGA experiments were
performed with a TA Instruments SDT 2960 simultaneous thermogravimetric/differential
scanning calorimetry system. The scans were recorded in air with a
heating rate of 10 °C min–1 in a temperature
range of 30–800 °C.

X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
XRD spectra were collected
with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, in Bragg–Brentano
geometry, equipped with a Göbel mirror using Cu Kα as
a source operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The patterns were acquired
in the 10–70° 2θ range (0.03°/step and 10 s/step).

Raman Spectroscopy
Micro-Raman experiments were carried
out in backscattering geometry at room temperature using an Horiba
T64000 triple spectrometer equipped with a Peltier-cooled charge-coupled
device detector (Horiba Synapse). The 514.5 nm line of an argon laser
(Spectra Physics Stabilite 2017) was used as the excitation source.
The laser power at the specimen surface was always kept below 5 mW.
Care was taken to avoid sample damage due to the interaction with
the laser beam. The scattered radiation was collected through a long
working distance 50× microscope objective (Olympus LMPLFLN, 50×/0.50).

The spectrograph, equipped with 2400 lines/mm gratings, was used
in double subtractive configuration for the low-wavenumber-region
(5–250 cm–1) measurements or as a single
stage in the 70–1000 cm–1 range. The relative
amount of Bi12O17Cl2 and (BiO)2CO3 was determined by the following equation (eq 1) 1  where R is the ratio of the
integrated area of peaks at 96 and 163 cm–1, characteristics
of Bi12O17Cl2 and (BiO)2CO3, respectively, and R0 is
the value of R for sample T50.

Absorption
Spectroscopy
Diffuse reflectance spectra
in the range 250–800 nm were performed on a CARY5E spectrophotometer
equipped with an internal diffuse reflectance accessory consisting
of a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)-coated integration sphere. The spectra
were acquired in reflectance mode (R%) with a spectral
band width of 4 nm and converted to absorbance by means of the Cary
WinUV 3.00 software package.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The morphology of
the samples was investigated by field emission SEM analysis. SEM measurements
were performed by a Sigma Zeiss instrument operated at an acceleration
voltage of 5 kV collecting the secondary electron signal.

X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS measurements
were performed on a PerkinElmer Φ 5600ci spectrometer using
a nonmonochromatized Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV), at a working
pressure lower than 10–9 mbar. The specimens, mounted
on steel sample holders, were introduced directly into the XPS analytical
chamber by a fast entry lock system. The sample analysis area was
800 μm in diameter. Survey scans were run in the 0–1100
eV range. Detailed spectra were recorded for the following regions:
Bi4f, Cl2p, O1s, and C1s. The reported binding energies (BEs, standard
deviation ± 0.2 eV) were corrected for charging effects by assigning
to the C1s peak associated with adventitious carbon a BE of 284.8
eV. The analysis involved Shirley-type background subtraction and,
whenever necessary, spectral deconvolution, which was carried out
by nonlinear least-squares curve fitting, adopting a Gaussian–Lorentzian
sum function. The atomic composition of the samples was calculated
by peak integration, using sensitivity factors provided by the spectrometer
manufacturer (Φ V5.4A software) and taking into account the
geometric configuration of the apparatus. The experimental uncertainty
on the atomic composition values does not exceed ±5%.

Specific
Surface Area and ζ Potential
Specific
surface area values were obtained from Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller
analysis of krypton adsorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature
(ASAP 2020; Micromeritics). Before analysis, the samples were degassed
at 120 °C for 12 h.

ζ Potential measurements were
performed on a catalyst dispersion (1 mg mL–1) in
Milli-Q water using a zetasizer NanoZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd.,
U.K.). The analyses were performed in triplicate at 20 °C.

Adsorption Kinetic Experiment
The material (100 mg)
was dispersed in 160 mL of an aqueous RhB or MO solution with an initial
concentration (C0) of 6 mg L–1, and the suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark. The suspension
temperature was maintained at 20 °C. At given time intervals,
3 mL aliquots were sampled and filtered through a 0.45 μm Millipore
filter to remove the catalyst. The concentration of dyes in the filtrates
was evaluated by recording the absorbance at the maximum of the absorption
spectrum of the target molecule (554 nm for RhB, 464 nm for MO) by
means of a UV–vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-2450).

The
material adsorption capacity (AC) was calculated from the following
equation 2  where C0 and Ceq (mg L–1) are the concentrations
of the dye solution at the initial stage and at the instant teq = 45 min when the adsorption–desorption
equilibrium is reached, m (g) is the mass of the
sample, and V (L) is the volume of the adsorbate
solution.

Photocatalytic Experiments
Photocatalytic
properties
of the samples were investigated by monitoring the decoloration of
organic dye aqueous solution under visible light. RhB and MO were
used as models of cationic and anionic pollutants, respectively. The
description of the experimental setup is discussed in detail elsewhere.63 In a typical experiment with MO, 200 mg of the
catalyst was dispersed in a dye aqueous solution (6 mg L–1, 1.9 × 10–5 M). In the case of RhB, 50 mg
of the catalyst and 1.5 × 10–5 M dye solution
(6 mg L–1) were used. Prior to irradiation, the
dye/catalyst suspensions were kept in dark for 45 min under stirring
to ensure the achievement of the adsorption–desorption equilibrium
under ambient conditions. During irradiation, at increasing time intervals,
aliquots of the suspension were withdrawn and filtered through a 0.45
μm Millipore filter to remove the catalyst. The residual dye
concentrations in the filtrates were analyzed by a UV–visible
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2450) at maximum absorption wavelengths
(λmax) of 554 and 464 nm for RhB and MO, respectively.

The decoloration efficiency (DE) was calculated from the following
equation 3  where C0 and Ct (mg L–1) are the concentrations
of the dye solution at the initial stage and at the t instant (45 < t < 180 min), respectively.
