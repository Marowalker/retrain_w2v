The
complexes [Cp′2Ln(μ-CH3)]2, (Cp′ = C5H4SiMe3; Ln =
Y, Tb, Dy) were reduced to determine if these methyl-bridged
complexes would form mixed valent 4fn5d1 Ln(II)/4fn Ln(III) compounds
or bimetallic 4fn5d1 Ln(II)
compounds containing 5d1–5d1 metal–metal
bonds upon reduction. Reaction of the known bridged-chloride
complexes, [Cp′2Ln(μ-Cl)]2, 1-Ln (Ln = Y, Tb, Dy), with MeLi forms the bridged-methyl
complexes [Cp′2Ln(μ-CH3)]2, 2-Ln, which were crystallographically characterized
for Tb and Dy. KC8 reduction of 2-Ln in the
presence of 2.2.2-cryptand produced 3-Y, 3-Tb, and 3-Dy, which exhibited intense dark colors and
broad absorbance peaks around 400 nm with molar extinction coefficients
of 1700, 2300, and 1800 M–1 cm–1, respectively, which are characteristics of Ln(II) ions. The dark
maroon 3-Y product had an axial electron paramagnetic
resonance spectrum at 77 K (g1 = 1.99, A1 = 17.9 G; g2 =
2.00, A2 = 17.7 G) and a two-line isotropic
spectrum at 273 K (g = 1.99, A =
18.4 G), which indicates that an Y(II) ion is present. Although
these results are indicative of Ln(II) ions present in the solution,
crystallographic evidence was not obtained to establish the structure
of these complexes.

Introduction
The +2 oxidation state
has recently been identified in crystallographically
characterizable monometallic molecular complexes of yttrium and all
of the lanthanides (except radioactive Pm). This was accomplished
using the coordination environment of three trimethylsilyl-substituted
cyclopentadienyl ligands, as shown in eq 1.1−6 Previously, the +2 oxidation state in molecular species had been
limited to Eu, Yb, Sm, Tm, Dy, and Nd, which had 4fn+1 electron configurations obtained by reducing
a 4fn Ln(III) precursor.7−10 Spectroscopic and structural characterizations as well as density
functional theory (DFT) calculations have shown that in the trigonal
coordination environment of a [(C5H3RR′)3]−3 ligand set (R = H, SiMe3,
R′ = SiMe3), the new lanthanide ions exhibited a
4fn5d1 ground state and 4d1 configuration for yttrium.1−6 Examples of these new +2 ions are also known with other ligands
including C5H3(CMe3)2 (Cptt)−11,12 and C5H2(CMe3)3 (Cpttt)−,13,14 the tris(aryloxide) mesitylene ligand, ((Ad,MeArO)3mes)3– 15,16 and N(SiMe3)2–.17 1  The discovery of the 4fn5d1 electron configurations in these new ions
presents the possibility of generating complexes which contain Ln–Ln
bonds. Traditionally, metal–metal bonding between two lanthanides
has been considered unlikely because the 4f orbitals have too limited
a radical extension from the nucleus to have significant overlap.
However, electrons in d orbitals are well suited to make metal–metal
bonds. Since the complexes of new 4fn5d1 Ln(II) ions involve monometallic complexes with sterically
crowded ligand environments, they are not ideal for placing two lanthanides
in close proximity to bond.

To address this problem, reductions
of [Cp′2Y(μ–Cl)]2 and [Cp′2Y(μ–H)(THF)]2 were explored.18 DFT calculations
suggested that reduction of these bimetallic complexes could form
complexes containing Y–Y bonds.18 Although spectroscopic studies, including electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and UV–vis spectroscopy, of the
reductions of these complexes suggested the formation of an Y(II)
ion,6,18,19 crystallographic
evidence was elusive. In the case of complexes containing electron-deficient
bridged hydride ligands, [Cp′2Y(μ–H)(THF)]2, only trimetallic tetrahydride complexes, [K(2.2.2-cryptand)]{[Cp′2Ln(μ-H)]3(μ-H)} (Ln = Y, Tb, Dy), were
isolated from the reduction reactions.18 The reduction of [Cp′2Y(μ–Cl)]2 provided an EPR spectrum at 77 K consistent with an Y(II)
ion. However, this complex was extremely thermally unstable,
which prohibited the collection of a room-temperature EPR spectrum,
and a crystal structure could not be obtained.

To avoid the
possibility of forming such trimetallic hydride-centered
products, the reduction of complexes containing electron-deficient
methyl-bridged ligands, [Cp′2Ln(μ–CH3)]2, has been explored and is reported here. Reduction
of the known complex, [Cp′2Y(μ–CH3)]2,20 is described
as well as analogous reactions of the Tb and Dy analogues, which were
synthesized for this study and crystallographically characterized
for definitive identification.

Results and Discussion
Reaction
of the known bridged-chloride complexes, [Cp′2Ln(μ-Cl)]2, 1-Ln, with 2 equiv
of methyl lithium generates the bridged-methyl complexes [Cp′2Ln(μ-CH3)]2, 2-Ln, needed for this study, Scheme 1 (Ln = Y, Tb, Dy). The previously reported Y complex
was identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy,20 and the paramagnetic Tb and Dy complexes were identified
by X-ray crystallography, Figure 1. 2-Tb and 2-Dy are isomorphous
with 2-Y. Crystallographic details can be found in the Supporting Information.

Scheme 1 Syntheses of [Cp′2Ln(μ-Cl)]2, 1-Ln, and [Cp′2Ln(μ-CH3)]2, 2-Ln {Cp′ = [C5H4(SiMe3)]}
The crystallographic data show
that the methyl-bridged complexes, 2-Ln, have shorter
Ln···Ln distances than either
the chloride precursors, 1-Ln, or the tetrahydrofuran
(THF)-solvated hydrides, [Cp′2Ln(μ-H)(THF)]2, Table 1.18 For example, the Tb···Tb distances
in the two molecules in the unit cell of 2-Tb were determined
to be 3.5415(5) and 3.5745(4) Å compared to 4.0705(4) and 3.7041(6)
Å for 1-Tb and [Cp′2Tb(μ-H)(THF)]2,18 respectively. The Ln–X–Ln
angles in 2-Ln were also determined to be the smallest
when compared to the chloride and hydride analogues. These were 89.73(8)
and 90.17(8)° in 2-Tb compared to 97.29(2) and 120.7(2)°
in 1-Tb and [Cp′2Tb(μ-H)(THF)]2,18 respectively. These smaller
distances could facilitate an interaction between the two rare-earth
ions upon reduction by bringing the metal centers closer to each other.

Reduction of the 2-Ln complexes with 1 equiv of KC8 in the presence of 1 equiv
of 2.2.2-cryptand (crypt) in THF
produced intensely colored red-brown products, 3-Ln 2  eq 2, typical of crystallographically
characterized complexes
of rare-earth ions in the +2 oxidation state, eq 1.2−4,6,18 The EPR spectrum of 3-Y at
77 K has an axial signal at g1 = 1.99, A1 = 17.9 G; g2 =
2.00, A2 = 17.7 G, and the room-temperature
EPR spectrum has an isotropic signal at g =
1.99, A = 18.4 G (Figure 2). These patterns are consistent with the
interaction of an unpaired electron with a 89Y nucleus
(100% abundant I = 1/2) and are characteristic of
Y(II) complexes (Figure 2).3−5,11

Figure 2 EPR spectra
of 3-Y at 77 K (left; g1 =
1.99, A1 = 17.9 G; g2 = 2.00, A2 = 17.7
G) and 273 K (right; g = 1.99, A = 18.4 G).

The UV–vis spectra
of 3-Y, 3-Tb, and 3-Dy, Figure 3, show broad absorbance
peaks at 420, 405, and 410
nm with molar extinction coefficients of approximately 1700, 2300,
and 1800 M–1 cm–1, respectively, based
on the moles of metal present in the sample. The ε values are
lower estimates that are based on the amount of 2-Ln used
to form the sample assuming complete reduction to 3-Ln. In comparison, [K(crown)][Cp′3Y] and [K(crypt)][Cp′3Y] have absorptions at 530 nm (ε = 2500 M–1 cm–1)6 and 520 nm (ε
= 4500 M–1 cm–1), respectively.3,4 The data on 3-Ln can also be compared with those from
the reductions of [Cp′2Y(μ-H)(THF)]2, 794 nm (ε = 1000 M–1 cm–1), [Cp′2Tb(μ-H)(THF)]2, 837 nm
(ε = 840 M–1 cm–1), and
[Cp′2Dy(μ-H)(THF)]2, 715 nm (ε
= 640 M–1 cm–1), Figure 4.18

Figure 4 UV–vis spectra of [Cp′2Ln(μ-H)(THF)]2 reduction products: Y (λ = 794 nm; ε

The dark-colored solutions of 3-Ln maintained
their
color in solution at −30 °C for several days, but they
did not yield crystalline products suitable for definitive characterization
by X-ray diffraction. Attempts to make analogues with 18-crown-6 instead
of crypt were similarly unsuccessful.

Conclusions
Although
the bridged-methyl complexes [Cp′2Ln(μ-CH3)]2, 2-Ln, can be reduced to form
dark solutions with EPR and UV–vis spectroscopic features consistent
with Ln(II), isolation of crystallographically characterizable Ln(II)
complexes has not been possible. These results indicate that the bis(Cp′)
coordination environment is not optimum for crystallizing bimetallic
complexes with a rare-earth metal in the +2 oxidation state.

Experimental
Details
All manipulations and syntheses described below were
conducted
with the rigorous exclusion of air and water using standard Schlenk
line and glovebox techniques under an argon atmosphere. Solvents were
sparged with UHP argon and dried by passage through columns containing
Q-5 and molecular sieves prior to use. Elemental analyses were conducted
on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 Series II CHNS elemental analyzer. UV–vis
spectra were collected at 298 K using a Jasco V-670 absorption spectrometer.
EPR spectra were collected using X-band frequency (9.3–9.8
GHz) on a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with an ER041XG microwave
bridge, and the magnetic field was calibrated with DPPH (g = 2.0036). Infrared (IR) transmittance measurements were taken as
compressed solids on a Cary 630 spectrophotometer with a diamond ATR
attachment. 2.2.2-Cryptand (Sigma-Aldrich) was placed under vacuum
(10–3 Torr) overnight before use. The solvent was
removed under vacuum from a solution of methyl lithium in Et2O (Sigma-Aldrich) to isolate it as a white powder. Anhydrous LnCl3 (Ln = Y, Tb, Dy),22 KC8,23 and KC5H4(SiMe3) (KCp′)24 were prepared
according to the literature. [Cp′2Ln(μ-Cl)]2 (Ln = Y,21 Tb,18 Dy18), 1-Ln, and
[Cp′2Y(μ-CH3)]220 were prepared by a modification of the literature
procedure.

[Cp′2Dy(μ-CH3)]2, 2-Dy
A solution (−30 °C) of 1-Dy (150 mg, 0.158 mmol) in Et2O (5 mL) was slowly added
to a −30 °C slurry of MeLi (12 mg, 0.546 mmol) in Et2O (5 mL). The total volume of the solution was increased to
20 mL with cold Et2O. The slightly cloudy colorless solution
was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. The
volatiles were removed from the solution in vacuo. The product was
extracted into hexane (10 mL) and then centrifuged to remove white
solids, presumably LiCl. The white solids were washed with hexane
(5 mL) twice. The volatiles were removed from the hexane solution
to isolate a white powder. The white powder was extracted into hexane
(10 mL) again, and any insoluble materials were discarded. The volatiles
were removed from the hexane solution to isolate 2-Dy as a white powder (123 mg, 0.136 mmol, 86%). X-ray quality crystals
were grown from a concentrated hexane solution at −30 °C.

value suggests incomplete combustion, as observed in other cases.1,25−28 The found CH ratio of C34H60.1 is consistent
with the formula.

[Cp′2Tb(μ-CH3)]2, 2-Tb
In a procedure analogous to
the synthesis of 2-Dy, 1-Tb (150 mg, 0.161
mmol) and MeLi (11
mg, 0.482 mmol) were combined in Et2O (20 mL) to isolate 2-Tb as a white powder (133 mg, 0.148 mmol, 92%). X-ray quality
crystals were grown from a concentrated hexane solution at −30
°C. IR: 3075(w), 2951(w), 2880(w), 2814(w), 2768(w), 1711(w),
1640(w), 1604(w), 1537(w), 1442(w), 1409(w), 1359(w), 1308(w), 1242(m),
1178(m), 1130(w), 1038(s), 904(m), 888(w), 830(s), 763(s), 751(s),
687(m). Anal. calcd for C34H58Tb2Si4: expected = C, 45.52; H, 6.52. Found: C, 41.93; H,
5.90. The low value suggests incomplete combustion, as observed in
other cases.1,25−28 The found CH ratio of C34H57 is consistent with the formula.

Reduction of
2-Y
In an argon-filled glovebox, a colorless
solution of 2-Y (106 mg, 0.140 mmol) and crypt (53 mg,
0.141 mmol) in THF (2 mL) was chilled to −30 °C. The solution
was passed through a KC8 column chilled to −30 °C,
and a dark red-brown solution, 3-Y, resulted. EPR spectra
were obtained at 77 K and room temperature. UV–vis (THF) λmax = 420 nm; ε = 1700 M–1 cm–1.

Reduction of 2-Dy
In a procedure analogous to the reduction
of 2-Y, 2-Dy (198 mg, 0.219 mmol) and crypt
(83 mg, 0.219 mmol) were combined in THF (2 mL) and passed through
a KC8 column to form a dark red-brown solution, 3-Dy. UV–vis (THF) λmax = 414 nm; ε = 1800
M–1 cm–1.

Reduction of 2-Tb
In a procedure analogous to the reduction
of 2-Y, 2-Tb (200 mg, 0.224 mmol) and crypt
(84 mg, 0.224 mmol) were combined in THF (2 mL) and passed through
a KC8 column to form a dark red-brown solution, 3-Tb. UV–vis (THF) λmax = 406 nm; ε = 2300
M–1 cm–1.
