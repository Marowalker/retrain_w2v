J-aggregates are a class of low-dimensional
molecular crystals
which display enhanced interaction with light. These systems show
interesting optical properties as an intense and narrow red-shifted
absorption peak (J-band) with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding
monomer. The need to theoretically investigate optical excitations
in J-aggregates is twofold: a thorough first-principles description
is still missing and a renewed interest is rising recently in understanding
the nature of the J-band, in particular regarding the collective mechanisms
involved in its formation. In this work, we investigate the electronic
and optical properties of a J-aggregate molecular crystal made of
ordered arrangements of organic push–pull chromophores. By
using a time-dependent density functional theory approach, we assess
the role of the molecular packing in the enhancement and red shift
of the J-band along with the effects of confinement in the optical
absorption, when moving from bulk to low-dimensional crystal structures.
We simulate the optical absorption of different configurations (i.e.,
monomer, dimers, a polymer chain, and a monolayer sheet) extracted
from the bulk crystal. By analyzing the induced charge density associated
with the J-band, we conclude that it is a longitudinal excitation,
delocalized along parallel linear chains and that its overall red
shift results from competing coupling mechanisms, some giving red
shift and others giving blue shift, which derive from both coupling
between transition densities and renormalization of the single-particle
energy levels.

Introduction
J-aggregates1 are a general class of
low-dimensional molecular dye crystals, which display coherent interaction
with light. These systems have interesting optical properties such
as an intense and narrow (i.e., long radiative lifetime) red-shifted
absorption peak (called J-band) not present in the spectrum of the
single monomer unit they are composed of, that enhances both emissive
and nonlinear optical properties.2 Furthermore,
because of the intermolecular mechanisms (i.e., van der Waals, π–π
stacking, hydrogen bonding, etc.), they have the ability to delocalize
and migrate electronic excitations at long distances.3,4 The position, intensity, and width of the red-shifted peak is strongly
related to the molecular arrangements and their mutual interactions.4−6

Since their discovery in 1936 by Jelley,1 J-aggregates have been widely studied and characterized
in the literature,
with a number of technical analyses about their dimensions, shapes,
and morphologies. From the experimental point of view, they are prepared
and formed in solutions (e.g., water) and extended three-dimensional
(3D) crystals are not usually observed. Rather, they often assemble
in low-dimensional structures. At the mesoscale, J-aggregates manifest
a complex morphological and structural variability, so that various
shapes have been observed at different dye concentrations and solution
conditions.2,5−9 Moreover, these molecules tend to aggregate in herringbone, brickwork,
ladder/staircase structures, with molecular planes normally oriented
to the monolayer plane. A detailed discussion about the links between
J-aggregates morphologies and optical properties is in ref (10).

In parallel, several
theoretical models have been put forward to
explain the characteristic narrowing and enhancement of red-shifted
band of J-aggregates.11−17 Because vibronic effects play no relevant role in the J-band,18 these models are often simplified by assuming
the adiabatic Born–Oppenheimer approximation and weak overlap
between molecular wavefunctions, as well as small excitations.11 This description has been extensively used to
reproduce the excitonic energy transfer in monomolecular chains.19,20 In other related works,18,21 the position of the
red-shifted peak is predicted from the knowledge of the monomer absorption
spectrum and the interaction strength between the monomers. The latter
model has been proved useful in particular to estimate the molecular
packing arrangements from measured absorption spectra.

Despite
the huge amount of experimental data, on the theoretical
side some crucial problems remain unsolved: to date, the most accurate
simulations have described not really extended systems but rather
small clusters,22 with just a few tens
of monomers (∼20), whereas experimental samples are composed
of hundreds or thousands of units. Solid-state approaches, which take
thoroughly into account long-range and many-body effects, have never
been proposed. Thus, a first-principles description
of extended low-dimensional J-aggregates, such as films and (quasi)
one-dimensional (1D) chains, would shed light on the complex interplay
between the intermolecular coupling and the resulting optical response.
The goal is to provide a microscopic rational of how the various molecular
arrangements that coexist in a realistic J-aggregate crystal, as well
as the quantum confinement along a given direction, contribute to
the overall red shift of the peak. This may also help to identify
guidelines for the design of J-aggregate with specific optical properties.

This is particularly relevant in view of the renewed experimental
interests about these systems, which exhibit an ultrastrong and coherent
light–matter interaction, useful to probe objects at the nanoscale.
For this reason, J-aggregates have been recently employed together
with plasmonic antennas to study hybrid nanostructures in the strong-coupling
regime.23−27 For example, the coupling between organic J-aggregates with metallic
nanosystems (e.g., nanoparticles, nanorods, nanodisks, etc.) forms
surface-plasmon exciton hybrid states (plexcitons) that could pave
the way toward active plasmonic devices operating at room temperature.28−33

In this work, we investigate a J-aggregate molecular crystal
composed
of 4-(N,N-dimethyl-amino)-4′-(2,3,5,6-tetrafluorostyryl)-stilbene.34

This molecule is also a push–pull
organic dye (Figure 1): it is a π-conjugated
system that possesses an intrinsic electric dipole because of the
electron donating (push) amine group and the electron withdrawing
(pull) F substituents and manifests an intramolecular charge-transfer
(ICT) behavior when optically excited.35−37 The latter is a key
property to polarize the molecular crystal because it permits to transfer
energy from one molecule to the other and to delocalize the excitation
throughout the whole aggregate. The unusual combination of J-aggregate
coupling and push–pull character makes this a unique system
with fascinating optical properties. Moreover, the choice of this
molecule is also motivated by the availability of the X-ray crystal
structure (encompassing several kinds of relative molecular arrangements)
and optical spectra characterization,34 and the computational convenience of its being charge neutral (no
counterions to simulate) but still electrostatically not trivial due
to its ground state dipole moment.

Its DFT frontier orbitals are also shown. (Bottom) 3D view of a section

and the dimer configurations that have been simulated in the present
work.

Results and Discussions
In this
section, we present and discuss the results of first-principles
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulations of a
J-aggregate bulk molecular crystal and of two low-dimensional structures,
specifically a linear chain and a monolayer film, extracted from it.
In particular, we focused on the J-bands and on the associated induced
charge densities, to describe the microscopic physical mechanisms
involved in the observed red shift. The bulk aggregate is composed
of the push–pull organic dye in Figure 1. Because of the presence of the amino substituent
on one side and the fluorine atoms on the other, this dye has an intrinsic
dipole that polarizes the frontier orbitals, see, for example, highest
occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
shown in Figure 1.
This is a well-known property of push–pull molecules that imparts
an ICT when optically excited.

This property is important to
excite the molecular crystal because
it permits to delocalize the excitation throughout the whole aggregate.
When moving from the isolated molecule to the bulk aggregate (Figure 2), we observe both
an enhancement and a red shift of the J-band, in agreement with the
experimental evidence.34 Quantitatively
speaking, the experimental red shift turns out to be somewhat larger
than what predicted here (0.3 eV vs 0.1 eV), but within the expected
accuracy of the calculation. The absolute position of the TDDFT peak
is red-shifted (by 0.7 eV) compared with the experiment, as expected
for Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) (more in Methods). We do not observe the narrowing of J-band reported
in the experiments for extended aggregates because in our simulations
the width of the peak has been externally fixed.

Figure 2 (a) TDDFT optical absorption
spectra of bulk crystal (black), monomer
(magenta), dimers (red, green, blue), and linear chain (ochre) arrangements
taken into account. (b) Induced charge density isosurfaces associated
with the different absorption peaks selected in the spectra shown
in panel (a). The accompanying arrows represent dipole toy models
to get a simplified representation of the interaction between the
induced charge densities.

To dissect the origin of the red shift, we have first considered
three dimer arrangements: a longitudinal (D1) and two stacked
dimers (D2, D3), whose atomic positions have
been extracted from the experimental X-ray structure of the bulk crystal
(Figure 1). In Figure 2, the peak D11 is red-shifted with respect to the monomer, whereas D2 and D3 are blue-shifted. These different behaviors
can be understood if we analyze the imaginary part of the induced
charge density associated with each peak (from now on with the term
induced density we will refer to the imaginary part of the induced
charge density). In the frequency domain, the imaginary part of the
induced charge density represents the portion of the charge that is
dephased by π/2 with respect to the incident electric field
and quantifies the optical absorption.38,39 Thus, assuming
a simple dipolar model of the induced densities, the first absorption
peak (D11 in Figure 2) of the longitudinal dimer (D1) is associated
with two interacting dipoles in a head–tail configuration.

The origin of the resulting red shift with respect to the isolated
monomer is twofold: (i) the coherent Coulomb coupling between the
induced charge densities of the two monomers and (ii) the renormalization
of single particle energy levels and consequently of the single particle
transition energies participating to the total excitation (see Table
S.II in section S1 of the Supporting Information). This is due to the ground state Coulomb interaction when monomers
are sufficiently close (i.e., in aggregate configuration). In rough
terms, the dipole moment of a molecule produces an electric field
that acts on those nearby and modifies ground-state properties including
single-particle energy levels. These mechanisms contribute to the
lowering of the total excitation energy (red shift).

Along the
same lines, the induced charge densities of peaks D2 and
D3 can be modeled as two stacked and horizontal
interacting dipoles. In this case, because of the different orientations
(i.e., vertically stacked with a slight lateral shift, see section
2 of the Supporting Information for additional
pictorial views) of both induced and static dipoles in each monomer,
their interaction causes an overall increase in the total excitation
energy. In this configurations, the increase of the total excitation
energy can be ascribed to the π–π interactions.
In general, the closer the two dimers are in a vertical stacked arrangement,
the higher the blue shift is (see peak D5 in Figure S3
in section 1 of the Supporting Information).

Because the spectra of the isolated dimer configurations
extracted
from the bulk crystal alone cannot explain the formation of the J-band,
we have considered another arrangement that is the periodic version
of dimer D1 (red Figure 1): a polymer chain that represents the limit of the
bulk crystal if confined in two directions, that is, a 1D J-aggregate.
This configuration was revealed to have a J-band even more red-shifted
with respect to the bulk. Again, analyzing the overall induced charge
density (peak C1 in Figure 2), the red shift
can be explained, as before, in terms of intra-chain Coulomb couplings.
Because in this case the number of aligned monomers is greater than
in D1, both red shift and peak intensity are enhanced.
If we consider now the 3D bulk crystal, we observe that the induced
charge density of peak B1 in Figure 2 describes
an excitation delocalized along parallel chains and with the same
crystal symmetry of peak C1 in Figure 2. The corresponding peak is slightly blue-shifted
with respect to the linear chain. This is due to the stacking interactions
in the bulk (peaks D2, D3) that cause an increase
of the excitation energy (i.e., H-aggregate behavior18,21).

In addition to the 1D chain, we considered also a two-dimensional
(2D) J-aggregate. This 2D film has been obtained from the bulk crystal
extracting a monolayer confined along a direction perpendicular to
the long axis (see Figure 3 and appendix B of the Supporting Information). Absorption spectra of bulk and monolayer crystals have been reported
in Figure 4, whereas
the induced charge densities of their J-bands have been plotted in Figure 5.

film extracted from bulk crystal and
confined in one dimension (Y axis) perpendicular
to the long axis (Z axis) of the molecular crystal
(dashed lines denote the unit cell boundaries).

Figure 4 TDDFT optical absorption spectra of J-aggregate bulk crystal and
monolayer film extracted from it. B1–2 are peaks of bulk crystal,
whereas F1–4 are those of the monolayer film.

Figure 5 Induced charge densities of the main absorption peaks
of Figure 4. (Top panel)
Induced
charge density of peak B1 of bulk crystal; (bottom panel)
induced charge density of peak F1 of monolayer film crystal.
For each induced charge density, we have plotted two different side
views, one is along the plane where both bulk and film are extended
and the other along the plane where the film is confined.

From 3D bulk to 2D layer, the energy of the J-band
changes by a
tiny amount. This can be understood by inspecting the corresponding
induced charge densities: the confinement of the film does not influence
the bulk J-band which is predominantly a longitudinally excitation
oriented along the principal crystal axis. Nevertheless, because of
the quantum confinement, new peaks at higher energy emerge in the
absorption spectrum of the film. In particular, peak F3 in Figure 4 has an induced density (see Figure S1c in
the Supporting Information) whose spatial
distribution reflects the broken symmetry of the crystal along the
confinement direction. Finally, a small satellite peak (F2) appears at low energy in the spectrum of the film. This peak is
present in the spectrum of the bulk crystal as well (B2).

By analyzing the induced charge densities of those peaks
(see Figure
S1a,b in the Supporting Information), we
see that because they do not sum up to zero separately in each monomer
(i.e., some of the monomers undergo a depletion, others an increase
of charge), these small peaks are expected to have a charge-transfer
(CT) character. However, because experiments do not detect any other
peak at energies lower than the J-band, we conclude that the simulated
CT states are misplaced by the limitations of the adopted semilocal
xc functional (PBE), which notoriously underestimates CT excited states.40

To conclude, our findings presented in
this work allow us to answer
most of the questions raised in the introduction:(1) The behavior of
the bulk crystal cannot
be deduced considering only its isolated components (i.e., monomer
and dimers). Instead, the nature of its optical properties is supramolecular,
such that the only way to account for all of the many-molecules related
effects is to simulate the extended system.

(2) The microscopic nature of the J-band
is analyzed by means of the imaginary part of the induced charge density.
The typical red-shifted peak (i.e., J-band) of a J-aggregate can be
explained in terms of competitions between stacked and longitudinal
molecular arrangements. The coherent Coulomb coupling between the
induced charge densities of the longitudinal arrangements (i.e., linear
chains) contributes to the red shift, whereas out-of-plane stacking
interactions contribute to the blue shift. The latter is weaker than
the former, and the overall result is the red shift that characterizes
the J-band. In addition, the enhancement of the J-band is discussed
in terms of a coherent alignment (along the principal crystal axis)
of the transition dipole moments of each monomer in the aggregate,
resulting in an overall amplified oscillator strength that gives the
enhancement of the intensity of the main peak.

(3) We compared the 3D bulk crystal with
two kinds of low dimensional J-aggregate crystals: a monolayer 2D
film, confined in one dimension, perpendicular to the principal crystal
axis; and a linear 1D chain, confined along two dimensions. These
systems allowed us to investigate the major effects of quantum confinement
in the extended J-aggregate: in the case of the 2D film, the confinement
does not break the symmetry of the J-band, but it generates new excitations
at higher energies that, due to surface effects, reflect the broken
symmetry of the 3D crystal. In the linear 1D chain case, where the
bulk is confined in all but the principal crystal axis, the observed
red shift of the J-band is even stronger with respect to that of the
bulk. This effect is due to the absence of the stacking interaction
that contributes to the blue shift of the main absorption peak.



Methods
The geometries of the push–pull
molecular dye and unit cell
of the bulk J-aggregate (Figure 1) have been taken from the experimental X-ray structure
available in the CCDC no. 961738 (for more details see also the Supporting
Information of ref (34)) with no further relaxations. These are the only external data that
have been used.

All of the supramolecular interactions (i.e.,
van der Waals, π–π,
hydrogen bonds, etc.) that contribute to determine the ground-state
geometry of the aggregate are implicitly taken into account within
the X-ray structure. For the evaluation of the absorption spectra
and of the induced charge densities, we have used the Quantum Espresso41 (QE) suite of codes, based on (time dependent)
DFT. In particular, for each system, we have first evaluated the DFT
ground state by using the PBE42 generalized
gradient exchange–correlation functional and ultrasoft pseudo-potentials
from the PS library.43 Single-particle
wavefunctions (charge density) are expanded in planewaves up to an
energy cutoff of 50 Ry (500 Ry).

Only Γ point has been
considered for Brillouin zone sampling
in the reciprocal space.

The dynamic polarizabilities and the
absorption spectra have been
simulated by using the turbo-TDDFT code39,44 of QE, which
employs a Liouville–Lanczos superoperator approach for linearized
TDDFT.38 The broadening parameter for each
peak has been fixed to 70 meV. The spectra in Figure 2 are normalized following the Thomas–Reiche–Kuhn
sum rule in order that the integral over all the frequency range adds
up to the total number of electrons per unit cell. For this reason,
because in the unit cell of the bulk there are four molecules, its
principal peak B1 is about four times that of the monomer
(i.e., M) and about two times the peaks of composite molecules (i.e.,
D11–D2–D3) and linear
chain (i.e., C1) which contain two molecules per unit cell
(see section S2 of the Supporting Information). This explains also why the intensity of peak C1 is
about half that of B1. This same reasoning applies to the Figure 4 where the unit cell
of the 2D film has a total of six molecules and its absorption spectrum
has a larger underlying area with respect to the bulk one.

We
exploited the turbo-TDDFT code also for the calculation of the
induced charge densities shown in Figure 2b. For each energy, the code returns three
different complex-induced charge densities, one for each independent
(orthogonal) polarization of the external exciting electric field,
see also ref (45) where
the same approach has been used. Here, we focus on optical absorption,
so we analyze specifically the imaginary parts of the induced densities.

To obtain a unique induced density for each excitation of the system,
we evaluated the one that gives the maximum optical absorption. This
happens when external electric field and transition dipole moment
are maximally coupled and point in the same direction. To achieve
that, we have properly linearly combined the three induced charge
densities calculated before (see section S3 of the Supporting Information for a clearer explanation).

To
simulate the bulk crystal with QE, we have used a monoclinic
unit cell containing four monomers with a total of 192 atoms. The
isolated structures (monomer and dimers) obtained from the bulk experimental
X-ray data were simulated by exploiting periodically repeated supercells,
containing the molecular systems in the central position, separated
by adjacent replica with ∼10 Å of vacuum in all spatial
directions.

For the low-dimensional structures (polymer chain
and monolayer
film J-aggregates), we applied the same procedure only for the direction(s)
along which the system is confined. The monolayer film unit cell has
been obtained by extracting a bidimensional layer from the bulk crystal.
With the aid of Materials Studio,46 we
have constructed a supercell and then isolated from it a monoclinic
unit cell containing six monomer units (288 atoms) and with ∼10
Å of vacuum along the confinement direction (see section S2 of
the Supporting Information for crystal
structures and computational details).
