Pretargeted positron emission tomography
(PET) imaging based on
bioorthogonal chemical reactions has proven its potential in immunoimaging.
It may also have great potential in nanotheranostic applications.
Here, we report the first successful pretargeted PET imaging of trans-cyclooctene-modified mesoporous silicon nanoparticles,
using 18F-labeled tetrazine as a tracer. The
inverse electron-demand Diels–Alder cycloaddition (IEDDA) reaction
was fast, resulting in high radioactivity accumulation in the expected
organs within 10 min after the administration of the tracer. The highest
target-to-background ratio was achieved 120 min after the tracer injection.
A clear correlation between the efficiency of the in vivo IEDDA labeling
reaction and the injected amount of the tracer was observed. The radioactivity
accumulation decreased with the increased amount of the co-injected
carrier, indicating saturation in the reaction sites. This finding
was supported by the in vitro results. Our study suggests that pretargeted
imaging has excellent potential in nanotheranostic PET imaging when
using high-specific-activity tracers.

Introduction
Pretargeted molecular
imaging has shown great potential in tracing
monoclonal antibodies using radiolabeled reporter compounds.1−6 The pretargeted strategy is based on separating the targeting moiety
and the radiotracer from each other until most of the targeting moiety
has reached its target tissue and the unbound fraction has cleared
from the body. The pretargeted methodology is beneficial especially
for tracing systems with slow pharmacokinetics, such as antibodies
with blood half-lives in the order of days, as it allows the use of
short-lived radioisotopes with clear dosimetric benefits.2,7

Bioorthogonal chemical reactions have been successfully applied
for pretargeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. These
reactions take place in a living biological system without interfering
or being interfered by any of the system’s native biochemical
processes.8,9 The most studied bioorthogonal reactions
are strain-promoted alkyne azide cycloaddition (SPAAC) and the inverse
electron-demand Diels–Alder cycloaddition (IEDDA) between tetrazine
and a dienophile. In addition to immunoimaging, these reactions have
been used very recently for tracing nanoparticles (NPs).10−12 Pretargeted PET imaging based on bioorthogonal chemical reactions
may have great potential in nanotheranostic applications. In nanotheranostics,
a drug and an imaging agent are integrated into the same nanoscale
delivery system, allowing image-guided drug delivery.13In
this way, the biodistribution and target-site accumulation of the
nanotheranostic agent can be monitored noninvasively in vivo with
good temporal resolution. Similarly to antibodies, peak accumulation
of a nanotheranostic agent into a tumor may take several hours to
several days, hampering the use of short-lived PET radioisotopes in
nanotheranostic applications, especially when using methods based
on the direct radiolabeling of the nanotheranostic system.

Mesoporous
silicon (PSi) is a very attractive material for targeted
drug delivery in nanomedicine. PSi is nontoxic and biodegradable;
it degrades readily in biological environments to form silicic acid,
which is excreted into urine.14−17 The degree and rate of biodegradation of PSi can
be modified by the porosity, pore size, and surface modification of
the material.18,19

Recently, we have reported
[18F]FDR-tetrazine ([18F]1) as
a promising new tracer for pretargeted
PET imaging.20 Herein, we report the development
of a pretargeted imaging strategy for PSi-NPs on the basis of an IEDDA
reaction between [18F]1 and trans-cyclooctene (TCO) (Figure 1). The IEDDA reaction follows second-order reaction kinetics,
which means that the reaction rate can be increased by increasing
either component of the reaction. For this reason, carrier-added tracers
are generally used in IEDDA-based pretargeted methods.21 However, tracer conditions cause competition
between the tracer and the carrier on bioorthogonal reaction sites.
We wanted to explore the effect of the added carrier on the in vivo
IEDDA reaction by investigating the sensitivity of [18F]1 to trace intravenously administered TCO-modified NPs in
the tissues of healthy animals at different time points following
NP delivery. Like other nontargeted nanomaterials, PSi exhibit rapid
and pronounced sequestration from the circulation by the organs of
the mononuclear phagocyte system, the liver and spleen, in healthy
subjects.22 Nontargeted NP biodistribution
in healthy mice is therefore an ideal model for pharmacokinetic studies,
as the pretargeted radiotracer will be present in the liver and spleen
in high amounts, facilitating region-of-interest delineation and quantitation
with expected low interindividual variation. In tumor xenografts,
there may be significant individual variations in tumor growth and
vascularization, which may influence the NP accumulation and complicate
the analysis.23,24

Figure 1 (A) Preparation of TCO-NPs and (B) description
of the pretargeted
methodology for tracing the NPs in healthy mice using [18F]1. TCO-NPs were administered 15 min or 24 h before
the intravenous (iv) injection of [18F]1.

The TCO-functionalized NPs were
successfully traced in vivo with
the pretargeted method using [18F]1. The in
vivo IEDDA reaction took place within 10 min after the injection of
the tracer. The highest radioactivity concentration was observed in
spleen and liver as typical for NPs.23 Radioactivity
concentration in the spleen, being representative of the in vivo IEDDA
reaction, decreased exponentially with the increased mass of the injected
tracer. With the lowest molar amount of the tracer, approximately
25% of TCO-NPs could be traced in the spleen. Specific activity (SA)
of the tracer was revealed as a very important factor for the yield
of the in vivo IEDDA reaction and the sensitivity of the detection.
This was confirmed in vitro, where the reaction yield decreased with
the increased mass of the tracer.

Results
Preparation
and Colloidal Stability of the TCO-NPs
TCO-NPs were prepared
from COOH-terminated porous silicon nanoparticles
(UnTHCPSi-NP) via a stepwise procedure, first by conjugating 3-azidopropylamines
on the surface through an amide bond, followed by an SPAAC reaction
with trans-cyclooctene-PEG12-dibenzocyclooctyne
(TCO-PEG12-DBCO) (Figure 1). Recently, it has been reported that AgNO3 treatment increases stability of strained TCOs during storage.25 Therefore, two sets of NPs were used. The first
set was TCO-NPs without AgNO3 treatment, and the second
set was TCO-NPs with AgNO3 treatment. The NPs were dissolved
in a 5.4% glucose solution using a tip sonicator and left undisturbed
at room temperature (RT). The AgNO3 treatment was found
to prevent the formation of large aggregates in the NP suspension
(Table 1).

Biodistribution
Compound 1 and its precursors
were prepared in accordance with the previously described procedures.20 [18F]1 was synthesized
from the aminoxy-functionalized tetrazine (5) and [18F]-5-fluoro-5-deoxy-ribose ([18F]4) as previously described (Scheme 1).20 To explore the influence
of the concentration of [18F]1 on the IEDDA
reaction, nonradiolabeled 1 was added as carrier to the
synthesized [18F]1. The TCO-NPs were intravenously
injected 15 min or 24 h before the injection of [18F]1 (Figure 1B) in healthy mice. The control animals received only [18F]1. Details of the in vivo click experiments are presented
in Table 2. The ex
vivo biodistribution revealed excellent in vivo reactivity for NPs
injected 15 min before the injection of [18F]1 (Figure 2). The highest
radioactivity accumulation was observed in the spleen. The reaction
between [18F]1 and the TCO-NPs was fast, and
11.0 ± 1.9% ID/g was observed in the spleen 15 min after the
injection of [18F]1, whereas the corresponding
spleen radioactivity was 2.8 ± 0.5% ID/g for the controls (Table S3). At 60 min, the spleen radioactivity
of the TCO-NP-treated animals was 9.8 ± 0.7% ID/g and only 1.0
± 0.3% ID/g for the controls. Lower levels of radioactivity were
observed in the liver (7.6 ± 2.2% ID/g) and lungs (4.6 ±
1.5% ID/g). The observed biodistribution of the in vivo labeled PSi-NPs
is in good agreement with that of the preclicked NPs (Figure S4), with high accumulation in the spleen
and liver as typical for nontargeted PSi-NPs.22 The preclicked NPs showed fast clearance from the blood (0.50 ±
0.04% ID/g at 15 min), thus precluding [18F]1 reacting with TCO-NPs in the blood and then accumulating in the
spleen as the major cause for the high radioactivity accumulation
in the spleen with the preinjected TCO-NPs. The accumulation in lungs
is typical for particles with increasing size; however, surface chemistry
of the NPs may contribute as well.26 For
NPs injected 24 h before the tracer, we could not observe any in vivo
click reaction between the NPs and the tracer. Clearly, the reactivity
of the TCO had been lost. This is most probably due to the cis–trans
isomerization or internalization of the NPs, but the dissolution of
the nanomaterial itself may also contribute and cannot be completely
excluded. The cycloaddition product itself is metabolically stable
at least up to 2 h, as can be seen from the steady level of preclicked
NPs at different time points (Figure S4). The AgNO3 treatment improved the colloidal stability
of the NP suspension. Therefore, we decided to use it for our further
investigations with PET.

Curves (TACs)
The intensive binding of [18F]1 to TCO-NPs in the spleen can be clearly visualized with
excellent target-to-background ratio 110–120 min after the
tracer injection (Figure 3). Accumulation of [18F]1 and its
radioactive metabolites can be seen in the urinary bladder, gall bladder,
and intestines of both the TCO-NP-receiving animals and controls,
due to urinary and hepatobiliary elimination of the tetrazine. TACs
indicate a clear difference to control in the spleen standardized
uptake value (SUV) within the first few minutes of observation (Figure 4). No
difference in the liver was observed until [18F]1 had been washed out.

with
TCO-NPs (0.2 mg/animal) 15 min before injecting [18F]1 (n = 2). The control animals were injected
only with [18F]1 (n = 2).

Kinetic Analysis
Logan and Patlak plots of the PET
data (Figures S8 and S9) confirmed that
binding in the spleen is irreversible as expected for a bioorthogonal
IEDDA reaction. However, the results of the kinetic modeling indicated
that the observed binding in the liver is reversible.

Effect of SA
on the IEDDA Reaction
Significant saturation
in the IEDDA reaction sites was observed in vivo, where radioactivity
in the spleen (% ID/g) decreased with the injected mass of carrier 1 (Figure 5A). The saturation was exponential, and all of the TCO-NPs in the
spleen could not be traced even when as little as 0.02 nmol of the
tracer was injected (corresponding to an SA of 207 GBq/μmol
at the time of injection). Figure 5B presents the percentage of the TCO-NPs traced in
the spleen with [18F]1 (calculated by formula 1) as a function of
the TCO/tetrazine ratio. The percentage of traced NPs was calculated
from the ex vivo biodistribution results of the pretargeted TCO-NPs
and preclicked particles, as presented in formula 1. The highest percentage was achieved with
the lowest injected mass of [18F]1 (TCO/[18F]1 ratio: 70). About 25% of TCO-NPs were traced
of what could be expected on the basis of the preclicked experiment.
This may be due to the limited availability and reactivity of the
TCO residues in vivo. The observed saturation in the IEDDA reaction
sites was further investigated in vitro using increasing amount of
the NPs and two different specific activities of the tracer. Concentrations
of the NPs and [18F]1 were kept in the micromolar
range to better simulate the conditions in vivo. The AgNO3-treated NPs showed no difference compared with the regular TCO-NPs
in the IEDDA reaction in vitro (Figure S2). The reaction yield decreased significantly with the increase in
the concentration of the saturating carrier 1 (Figure 5C). IEDDA reaction
yields of over 90% were achieved when more than 3.4 equiv of TCO were
used in comparison to [18F]1 (corresponds
to 0.08 mg/mL of NPs).

Discussion
The objective of this
study was to evaluate the [18F]1 in pretargeted
PET imaging and to explore the suitability
of the pretargeted strategy for nanotheranostic applications. High-SA
[18F]1 was successfully used in bioorthogonal
IEDDA reaction for tracing TCO-modified PSi-NPs. Logan and Patlak
plots of the PET data confirmed that binding in the spleen is irreversible
as expected for a bioorthogonal IEDDA reaction. However, the results
of the kinetic modeling indicated that the observed binding in the
liver is reversible. The IEDDA reaction itself is irreversible. The
observed difference in kinetics may be due to the metabolic activity
of the enzymes in the liver or faster internalization of the NPs.

It has been reported that the length of the PEG linker has an influence
on the reactivity and stability of the PEGylated TCOs.27,28 Rossin et al. reported the inactivation of antibody-bound TCO via
trans–cis isomerization by copper-containing proteins. This
isomerization was counteracted by shortening of the linker.27 On the other hand, inactivation of TCO moieties
on the surface of antibodies has been reported to be caused by the
interactions of the hydrophobic TCO with the antibody, and this was
overcome by using PEG linkers (4 or 24 subunits).28 We used a PEG12-linker to reduce the possible
deactivation of the TCO on the thermally hydrocarbonized silicon surface
and to make the TCO-moiety sterically more accessible for the 18F-tetrazine tracer. Our results revealed that over 70 equiv
of TCO was needed to trace 25% of TCO-NPs in the spleen with [18F]1 in vivo. In contrast, 4 equiv of TCO leads
to almost complete reaction in vitro. The NP concentrations in the
in vitro and in vivo experiments were comparable (0.08 mg/mL in vitro
and 0.12 mg/g in spleen in vivo (calculated from preclicked results,
see Supporting Information (SI))). This
indicates that part of the TCO groups had lost their reactivity due
to either the isomerization of the groups or the formation of a plasma
protein corona on the NP surface after intravenous delivery. When
the NPs were administered 24 h before the tracer injection, no reaction
occurred, suggesting that the activity of the TCO had decreased. Either
there was not enough sterical hindrance, masking the TCO group to
prevent the cis–trans isomerization in vivo, or the NPs had
been completely internalized at 24 h, making the TCO groups unreachable
to the 18F-tetrazine tracer. Consequently, further optimization
is needed for improving the stability of the dienophile on PSi surfaces
and to determine the degree of PSi NP internalization to phagocytic
cells over time in vivo.

Carrier-added conditions are usually
preferred in the IEDDA-based
pretargeted immunoimaging.21 Duijnhoven
et al. studied the phenomena with AVP04-07 diabody and 177Lu.21 They concluded that in their study
optimal molar ratio in vivo was 1:1 (TCO-diabody/tracer). A decreased
tracer accumulation in the tumor was observed with a lower amount
of the added carrier. Under our conditions with NPs, the best results
were achieved with the lowest amount of [18F]1 (0.02 nmol) and with a molar ratio of 1:0.014 (TCO/tracer). Under
these conditions, we could only trace about 25% of the TCO-NPs in
the spleen. Changes in TCO reactivity due to either the isomerization
of the groups or the formation of a protein corona on the NP surface
in plasma may have a significant influence on the observed results.
Furthermore, reaction kinetics in conjunction with the fast elimination
of the tracer certainly contribute.

Our study suggests that
in bioorthogonal chemical reactions under
tracer conditions, saturation by a carrier plays a significant role
and the most efficient in vivo IEDDA labeling is achieved when high-SA
tetrazine is used. The observed saturation on the IEDDA reaction sites
when using a high-SA radionuclide 18F may also concern
the pretargeted PET imaging of antibodies, where the available TCO
concentration may be even lower. However, further studies are needed
to assess the importance of the findings to the pretargeted PET imaging
of antibodies.

Conclusions
The irreversible nature
of binding and the limited number of TCO
binding sites are very important factors of the in vivo IEDDA reactions.
We achieved the best IEDDA reaction efficacy with the highest SA of
the 18F-labeled tetrazine [18F]1 and successfully imaged the accumulation of the modified-silicon-based
NPs in vivo with PET–CT. The in vivo IEDDA reaction between
the 18F-tetrazine and TCOs on the surface of the PSi-NPs
was fast and occurred within the first 10 min, as seen from the TACs.
The yielded cycloaddition product was stable in the in vivo environment
for at least 2 h. However, further optimization is still needed to
maintain the high reactivity of TCO groups to permit pretargeted imaging
over the course of days, which would be relevant for longer-circulating
nanotheranostic agents. Our results confirm that pretargeted imaging
has excellent potential in nanotheranostic PET imaging when using
high-SA tracers.

Experimental Section
Unless otherwise
noted, all reagents were purchased from commercial
suppliers and used without further purification. All water used was
ultrapure (>18.2 MΩ cm–1).

Radiosynthesis
Compound 1 and its precursors
were prepared in accordance with the previously described procedures.20 [18F]1 was synthesized
from the aminoxy-functionalized tetrazine (5) and [18F]4 as previously described (Scheme 1). To explore the influence
of the concentration of [18F]1 on the IEDDA
reaction, nonradiolabeled 1 was added as carrier to the
synthesized [18F]1. The SA was adjusted to
range between 207 (no carrier added) and 0.04 GBq/μmol (maximal
carrier added) at the time of injection.

Preparation of TCO-NPs
The UnTHCPSi-NPs were prepared
from p+-type Si(100) wafers as previously described.22 After fabrication and size selection, the partially COOH-terminated
UnTHCPSi-NPs had a hydrodynamic diameter of 158 ± 3 nm (zeta
potential: −40.5 ± 2.5). The NPs were stepwise modified
to have TCO groups on the surface (Figures 1A and S1 and Table S1). To enable further chemical modification, the carboxylic acid groups
were activated by N-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide (NHS/EDC) cross-linking and conjugating 3-azidopropylamine
through an amide bond formation to the NPs. The TCO moieties were
attached on the surface of the azide-functionalized PSi-NPs via an
SPAAC reaction with TCO-PEG12-DBCO resulting in the change
of the hydrodynamic diameter of the NPs to 167 ± 3 nm (zeta potential:
−39.8 ± 5.7). The amount of the resulting TCO was determined
by an elemental analysis of the NPs (details in SI). In the first animal experiments, the TCO-NPs were dissolved
in a 5.4% glucose solution using a vortex mixer before injecting the
NPs into animals. Because of the high radioactivity accumulation in
the lung (Figures S4 and S5) probably due
to the formation of aggregates, for the later studies, the TCO-NPs
were formulated by dissolving them in a 5.4% glucose solution using
a tip sonicator. Recently, it has been reported that AgNO3 treatment increases stability of strained TCOs during storage.25 AgNO3 modification was carried out
by dissolving TCO-NP (2 mg) in methanol using a tip sonicator and
stirring the TCO-NP suspension at RT for 1 h with AgNO3 (25 mg). Then, the mixture was centrifuged (10 000g, 5 min), and the supernatant was dismissed. The particles
were dispersed in water using a tip sonicator and again centrifuged
(10 000g, 5 min), after which the supernatant
was dismissed. The washing was repeated with 5.4% glucose solution.
The particles were redispersed in the 5.4% glucose solution using
a tip sonicator and injected into animals. The size and zeta potential
of the resulting Ag-treated TCO-NPs were 165 ± 2 and −40.0
± 5.1, respectively.

In Vitro Reactivity of TCO-NPs
To
investigate the optimal
TCO/Tz ratio for the IEDDA reaction and the saturation of the reaction
sites in vitro, TCO-NPs (0.001–0.2 mg/mL) were incubated with
[18F]1 of two different specific activities
(18.4 and 0.18 GBq/μmol) in PBS with a pH of 7.41 (the total
volume in each experiment was 1 mL). To confirm that AgNO3 modification did not decrease the reactivity of the Ag-treated TCO-NPs
(0.0007–0.013 mg/mL), they were tested with an SA of 19.2 GBq/μmol.
The reaction was let to proceed for 5 min at RT, after which the samples
were centrifuged (10 000g, 5 min) and the
radioactivity of the supernatant (unreacted [18F]1) and the pellet (reacted [18F]1 with
the NPs) were measured to determine the yield of the IEDDA reaction
(Figure 5C).

Colloidal
Stability of the NP Suspension after the AgNO3 Treatment
Colloidal stability of the NP suspension
after AgNO3 treatment was investigated by repeated measurements
using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS. Two sets of NPs were used: the
first set was TCO-NPs without AgNO3 treatment, and the
second set was TCO-NPs with AgNO3 treatment. The NPs were
dissolved in a 5.4% glucose solution by using a tip sonicator. The
suspensions were left undisturbed at RT. In set time points, the Z-average and PdI were measured.

Animal Experiments
All animal experiments were performed
in accordance with the respective national and European legislation
with an approved ethical license from the National Board on Animal
Experimentation (Regional State Administrative Agency of Southern
Finland, Finland and VUmc, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Details of
the in vivo click experiments are presented in Table 2. The in vivo reactivity of [18F]1 was studied in healthy mice after the administration
of TCO-NPs (200 μg in 5.4% glucose solution, 1.42 nmol of TCO),
which were intravenously injected 15 min or 24 h before the injection
of [18F]1 (6.2 ± 2.5 MBq, 0.02–117
nmol in 0.9% NaCl solution) (Figure 1B). The control animals received only [18F]1 (3.4 ± 1.4 MBq, 0.02–0.29 nmol in 0.9%
NaCl solution). For NPs injected 15 min before the tracer injection,
ex vivo biodistribution was studied at four time points: 15, 30, 60,
and 120 min after the injection of [18F]1.
For NPs injected 24 h before the tracer injection, ex vivo biodistribution
was studied in triplicate 60 min after the injection of [18F]1. The animals were sacrificed under anesthesia by
cervical dislocation at designated time points after tracer administration,
and samples of tissues and body fluids were collected for radioactivity
measurements and weighing. The tissue samples were counted on an automated
γ-counter and radioactivity decay correction was applied. The
ex vivo biodistribution results were expressed as a percentage of
the injected radioactivity dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g). PET imaging
with Mediso nanoScan PET–CT was performed with TCO-NPs for
60 min (n = 3), and PET imaging with Inveon Multimodality
PET–CT was performed with TCO-NPs for 120 min (n = 2). With CT as the anatomical reference, a quantitative PET analysis
was performed by defining regions of interest (ROIs) with Inveon Research
Workplace 4.1 software. The radioactivity concentration was expressed
as an SUV, calculated using the average radioactivity concentration
of the ROI normalized with the injected radioactivity dose and animal
weight, and as TAC. The blood TAC was obtained from the left ventricle
of the heart. The dynamic PET data were analyzed graphically by Logan
and Patlak plots using image-derived whole-blood TACs as input function.
The contribution of radioactive metabolites to the blood TAC was considered
negligible20 in this preliminary analysis.

The percentage of NPs traced in vivo in the spleen on the basis
of ex vivo biodistribution was calculated by formula 1 1  where % ID/gpretargeted NPs is the percentage of injected dose per
gram of radioactivity in
the pretargeted TCO-NPs experiment, % ID/g18F-1 is the percentage of injected dose per gram of radioactivity
in the [18F]1 control experiment, and % ID/gpreclicked NPs is the percentage of injected dose per
gram of radioactivity in the preclicked TCO-NPs experiment.

Statistical
Analysis
Results of the biodistribution
assays were expressed as mean ± s.d. of at least three independent
experiments. Welch’s t-test was used to evaluate
the statistical significance, and the probabilities of *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.001 were considered statistically
significant. The statistical analysis was carried out using Origin
8.6 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA).
