Novel
super toughened bioplastics are developed through controlled
reactive extrusion processing, using a very low content of modifier,
truly a new discovery in the biodegradable plastics area. The super
toughened polylactide (PLA) blend showing a notched impact strength
of ∼1000 J/m with hinge break behavior is achieved at a designed
blending ratio of PLA, poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), and poly(butylene
adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), using less than
0.5 phr peroxide modifier. The impact strength of the resulting blend
is approximately 10 times that of the blend with the same composition
without a modifier and ∼3000% more than that of pure PLA. Interfacial
compatibilization among the three biodegradable plastics took place
during the melt extrusion process in the presence of a controlled
amount of initiator, which is confirmed by scanning electron microscopy
and rheology analysis. The synergistic effect of strong interfacial
adhesion among the three blending components, the decreased particle
size of the most toughened component, PBAT, to ∼200 nm, and
its uniform distribution in the blend morphology result in the super
tough biobased material. One of the key fundamental findings through
the in situ rheology study depicts that the radical reaction initiated
by peroxide occurs mainly between PBS and PBAT and not with PLA. Thus,
the cross-linking degree can be controlled by adjusting renewable
sourced PLA contents in the ternary blend during reactive extrusion
processing. The newly engineered super toughened PLA with high stiffness
and high melt elasticity modulus could reasonably serve as a promising
alternative to traditional petroleum plastics, where high biobased
content and biodegradability are required in diverse sustainable packaging
uses.

==== Body
Introduction
Research on toughness
of polymer-based materials has been attracting
attention from scientists and industry for decades because it is one
of the important properties in the real application of these materials.1 Impact resistance can be used to measure the
ability of a material to withstand the stress of a sudden load, which
is probably the most important mechanical property because it is closely
related to the safety, liability, and service life of the plastic
product.2 Therefore, toughening modification
of traditional brittle plastics such as polystyrene (PS)3 and polypropylene (PP)4 has been extensively researched and reported. However, with the
increasing attention on global environmental issues and shortages
of our finite petroleum resources, sustainable biodegradable polymers
with superior properties have drawn much interest for their advantage
of replacing the century’s traditional nonbiodegradable polymers
in various applications.5 Many novel biobased
and biodegradable polymers with different properties, such as polylactide
(PLA), poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), polycaprolactone (PCL), poly(butylene
adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), and polyhydroxyalkanoate
(PHA), have been developed and modified extensively in recent years.6 Nevertheless, most of the inherent inferior properties
of these polymers have limited their applications for many structural
materials in the market when used alone.

For example, PLA, an
important 100% biobased and biodegradable
polyester on a commercial scale, possesses high modulus and strength
comparable to commercial polystyrene (PS). However, its brittleness
and low impact resistance greatly limit its applications. Therefore,
different kinds of modifications on these biopolymers, including incorporating
thermal, mechanical, processability, and gas-barrier properties, have
been investigated in the past years.7 As
mentioned in the beginning, toughening modification with acceptable
stiffness and strength is so important in the application, which holds
an absolutely large part of the research, especially on brittle polymers
such as PLA.8 Toughening the brittle polymers,
incorporating a rubber phase or melt blending with other tough elastomers,9 optimizing morphologies of the blends such as
core–shell structures,10 and adding
a third polymer11 or filler (microfibers
or nanofillers) to the polymer matrix6 to
increase the blend compatibility have been used as main approaches.

As important elastomers, ethylene-based rubbers, such as poly(ethylene-glycidyl
methacrylate) (EGMA),12 ethylene methyl
acrylate–glycidyl methacrylate (EMA–GMA), and poly(ether-b-amide) copolymer (PEBA), have been widely used in improving
the toughness of biopolymers and given positive results. The toughening
mechanisms of PLA by EMA–GMA and EMAA-Zn have already been
studied systematically.13 The studies found
that the type of compatibilizer, blending temperature, composition
ratio, phase morphology, and suitable interfacial adhesion influence
the final impact strength of the blends. Yuryev et al.14 reported the toughening of PLA by EMA–GMA
with Joncryl ADR-4368C as the compatibilizer and found that the processing
temperature had an influence on the final impact strength of the PLA
blends. Zhang et al.15 prepared a toughened
PLA/EMA–GMA/PEBA ternary blend by controlling the morphology.
Other studies on natural rubbers16 and
epoxidized rubbers17 have also been investigated.
Recently, fully biobased thermoplastic vulcanizates consisting of
PLA and biobased elastomers such as Poly (lactate/butanediol/sebacate/itaconate)
(PLBSI)18 and vulcanized unsaturated aliphatic
polyester elastomers (UPEs)19 by dynamic
vulcanization with high toughness have also been prepared and researched
by others. Two issues are worth noticing from the above research:
(i) the toughening efficiently worked only when interfacial compatibilization
between PLA and the other polymers is improved on blending with rubbery
polymers (elastomer), and (ii) the incorporation of the toughened
elastomer or a third polymer such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)11b sacrificed the biodegradability of PLA adversely.

Biodegradability should be taken into consideration when using
modified biobased polymers, especially for sustainable packaging uses.
Melt blending with fully biodegradable polymers to fabricate toughened
green blends seems to be more important and interesting in research
and industry. Therefore, various kinds of biodegradable polymers have
been researched. Many studies on improving the physical properties
of neat polymers by binary blending or ternary blending methods have
been done previously.20 In the melt blending
of different polymers, the compatibility between the phases is a vital
factor that influences the performance of the end products.21 Recently, Guo et al11b reported an increase in the compatibility of 70PLA/30PBAT by structuring
nanoscale interfacial PMMA, where the impact strength can be improved
to 188 J/m. The resulting impact is not significant to substitute
high-impact plastics such as acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene
(ABS). This is because the interface adhesion for high-impact strength
should be much stronger compared to that required in improving tensile
strain, which is ascribed to the debonding with suitable interface
interactions.13d

On the basis of
the above discussion, fully biodegradable polymers
are selected to fabricate super tough green blends with increased
interfacial compatibility between the different polymers. Ravati and
Favis have shown that a complete wetting tricontinuous morphology
formed in the 33PBS/33PLA/33PBAT ternary blends can be achieved.22 They found that balanced toughness and strength
are obtained in the blends with three highly interacting phases where
all components are fully continuous.20a By adjusting the composition ratios of the three biodegradable polymers
in our studies, we aimed to increase the biocontents.

The novelty
of our studies includes the following: (i) the fully
biodegradable matrix design with improved impact strength to realize
super toughness (notched impact strength >530 J/m) of the final
blends.
(ii) The mechanical properties of the PLA/PBS/PBAT blends were governed
by a tailored morphology and controlled viscosity of the toughened
PBAT component during the reactive extrusion processing. (iii) Also,
by using PBS in the ternary blend, which possesses high compatibility
with the toughening phase, for example, PBAT, to decrease the amounts
of the toughening phase used, we could balance the stiffness–toughness
in the final products. With significantly improved super toughness
and melt viscosity, the fully biodegradable blends can find extensive
application to replace some conventional petroleum-based plastics,
creating a sustainable future.

Results and Discussion
Property Performance Evaluation
The toughness performance
of the blends with and without peroxide is evaluated in our work by
notched impact strength firstly and demonstrated in Figure 1. It can be found that the
notched Izod impact strength of the blends is increased significantly
because of the compatibility effect brought about by the in situ reaction.
The notched impact strength of the compositions is shown in Figure 1a. Although PBAT
shows high toughness with nonbreak impact performance, the impact
strength of the ternary blends without peroxide is still as low as
100 J/m, much lower than commercial ABS with 450J/m.24 Interestingly, a sharp brittle–ductile transition
occurred when peroxide was added into the ternary blends with increasing
PBS and PBAT amounts to 40 wt %. The impact strength of the blends
with peroxide is almost 10 times that without peroxide, from break
to hinge as shown in Figure 1. Compared to that of pure PLA, the level of impact strength
of the blends is almost 30 times and even higher than that of commercial
ABS, showing super toughness. The impact strength of the samples showed
little change with increasing peroxide concentrations, remained at
high levels (>700 J/m), and reached 1000 J/m, which is rarely reported
previously. As we know, the impact strength is important for the application
because it can be used to evaluate the ability of a material to withstand
sudden fracture or the amount of energy required to propagate a crack.25 It is believed that the super tough biodegradable
ternary blends can find an application in fields requiring high toughness.

performance of the ternary blends (a) reported in this work
compared to (b) other works: (a) notched Izod impact strength of the
PLA ternary blends and (b) comparison of stiffness–toughness
properties between this work and other reported super tough PLA blends,
PLA/UPE/DCP,19 as well as a petro-based
polymer, ABS (Magnum 1150 EM).23

Normally, when increasing the
toughness of a material by using
high contents of rubber, the stiffness of the material decreases dramatically.
Maintaining the high stiffness while improving the toughness is of
a significant value in polymer research. The data in Figure 1b address the advantage of
our reported blends compared to the traditional petrol-based plastics,
such as ABS, and most of the earlier reported super tough PLA blends.
Compared to PBAT, a more toughened bioplastic but with a low modulus
value of ∼70 MPa, the PBS component has a higher modulus value
(∼700 MPa) that helps in improving the stiffness of the PLA-based
ternary blend during reactive blending.

The typical tension
stress–strain curves of the ternary
blends are shown in Figure 2, and the relative mechanical properties are obtained and
depicted in Figure 3. The stiffness (tensile modulus in Figure 3a) is mainly decided by the PBS and PBAT
composition ratios. Without peroxide, the modulus decreased drastically
with increasing PBS and PBAT amounts, and this occurrence is fairly
common because the additional PBS and PBAT are both rather tough materials
with low moduli, especially PBAT with a modulus about 70 MPa. However,
the modulus increased at high peroxide contents, especially for P-S10T10-I0.75 and P-S20T20-I0.75. It is suggested that the
increased modulus probably results from the improved crystallinity
of PLA as the branching chains can act as a nucleation agent of PLA,
which can be explained by the thermal properties as shown in Figure 4. The tensile strength
(Figure 3b) lies in
the ranges of 33 to 38 MPa, within 10–20 wt % PBS and reaches
the highest at 40 wt % PBS content, 0.75 phr peroxide. This is ascribed
to the strain hardening in tensile stretching, because of the high
contents of PBS and PBAT, as shown in Figure 2b.

compounding blends with different compositions: (a) the stress–strain

and (d) flexure modulus and strength.

blends as calculated from the second heating DSC curves (heating at
10 °C/min): (a) the dependence of crystallinity of PBS on peroxide
contents, (b) the dependence of crystallinity of PLA on peroxide contents,
and (c) the dependence of melting point of the PBS and PLA phases
on peroxide contents.

The incorporation of the tough PBS and PBAT increased the
elongation
at break of the blends significantly, as shown in Figure 3c. It is around 167% for the
P-S40T20 samples, much higher than that of the pure PLA. It should
also be noted that the increase in peroxide concentrations tended
to result in a decrease in the tensile strain, totally different from
the impact strength change. This difference could be due to the differences
in the crack-initiation mode and strain rate between these two tests.
With the introduction of peroxide into the ternary blends, the molecular
chains are highly branched or cross-linked. First, the existing high-entanglement
molecular chains greatly limited the chain movement during the tensile
stretch of the samples, leading to the decreased elongation at break,
especially for the P-S40T20-Ix samples
with high gel contents. Second, to achieve good impact strength, a
high level of interfacial adhesion is required.26 In this sense, the impact strength is more sensitive to
the interfacial compatibility. However, the very strong interfacial
adhesion is unfavorable for the debonding of the phase, which can
lead to the microvoiding during the tensile stretch13d,27 as the debonding of the toughening phase from the matrix requires
very strong external force, such as high-speed impact. As a slow deformation
process, the force in the tensile testing is not strong enough to
pull out the toughening phase when the adhesion between PBAT and the
matrix is very strong. As a result, the absence of the microvoiding
will delay the occurrence of matrix yielding, resulting in the inferior
tensile elongation at break. Meanwhile, the very strong interfacial
adhesion means that the polymer chains are interacting with each other
with high entanglement. The relaxation and chain alignment in the
stretching direction during the tensile testing will be suppressed
once the chains are highly entangled, which leads to the decreased
elongation at break of the plastics. However, for samples with zero
or low gel contents, P-S10T10-I0.3 and P-S20T20-I0.3, the elongation at break increased because of the enhanced compatibility
between the ternary components as the branching or cross-linked copolymers
form during the extrusion reaction. Especially for the P-S10T10-I0.3, the elongation of the samples with 0.3 phr peroxide is
double that of the P-S10T10 without peroxide, revealing the enhanced
compatibility effects caused by the peroxide. Meanwhile, the flexural
modulus and strength shown in Figure 3d are mainly influenced by the PBS and PBAT amounts
in the blends, no matter how much peroxide is used. The flexural strength
and modulus both decreased with increasing PBS and PBAT contents.

The related thermal parameters calculated from the differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) cooling and following heating curves are
summarized in Table 1, and the crystallinity and melting point of the blends are shown
in Figure 4, to investigate
the effect of peroxide concentrations on the thermal properties. From
the listed glass-transition temperature (Tg) of the blends, it can be found that the compatibility between PLA
and PBS/PBAT has been improved with this method as the Tgvalues are close to each other after reactive extrusion.
The dependence of the crystallinity (Xc) on peroxide contents is completely opposite for the PBS and PLA.
With the introduction of 0.3 phr peroxide, the Xcof PBS decreases while the Xcof
PLA increases. The Xc of PLA has been
increased from about 2.5% (amorphous) to 15% for the P-S40T20-Ixseries. Two reasons account for this opposition.
First, PBS possesses better reactivity with peroxide compared to PLA
and peroxide. During the process, the PBS chains are highly branched
or even cross-linked, and the cross-linking would greatly limit the
chain movement, which suppressed the crystal growth of PBS, whereas
the PLA chains are only slightly branched because of the low reactivity
between the PLA and peroxide. Second, the crystallization of PLA is
mainly controlled by the nucleation efficiency so that different materials,
such as high-melting-point PLA,28 nucleation
agent TMC-328,29 and stereocomplex PLLA/PDLA,30 can be used as nucleation agents of PLA to improve
its crystallization rate and final crystallinity. In our ternary blends,
PBS melts itself,31 and slightly branched
PLA chains32 act as nucleation sites to
improve the crystallization of PLA. The melting point of PBS and PLA
both decreased with increasing peroxide concentrations, as shown in Figure 4c. The reduction
of the melting points of the two phases indicated that the crystals
formed in PBS and PLA are imperfect compared to those of the pure
polymers. This is because the molecular segmental mobility of the
polymer is greatly restricted by the enhanced branching/cross-linking
reaction. Thus, the crystal growth and the lamella thickness increase
would be suppressed by the branched/cross-linked chains, resulting
in the imperfect crystals in different phases. Finally, the imperfect
and thinner crystals result in the decrease of the melting temperature
(Tm) of PBS and PLA. On the other hand,
the suppressed crystal growth because of the enhanced entanglement
structures also indicated that the molecular chains in the different
phases intercalated, meaning that the good compatibility resulted
from the peroxide interactions.33

Besides the super toughness of the biodegradable blends, the materials
also possess high melt elasticity because of the in situ reaction
between the components and peroxide. The storage and loss moduli of
the blends with 0.3 phr and without the peroxide initiator are shown
in Figure 5a,b, respectively.
For the neat PLA, PBS, and PBAT, a typical Newtonian liquid behavior
(G′ ∼ ω2, G″ ∼ω) could be observed at low frequencies.
For the ternary blends, the terminal relaxation will deviate from
this Newtonian liquid behavior because of the multirelaxation behavior
in the ternary blends. This deviation becomes more obvious with increasing
PBS and PBAT contents. A tanδ peak can be found in the P-S20T20
and P-S40T20 blends from the loss tangent (tanδ = G″/G′) shown in Figure 5c, meaning that a network structure appears
with the introduction of higher PBS and PBAT amounts. This may be
ascribed to the structure evolution of the blends from the sea-island
to co-continuous morphology at higher PBS and PBAT amounts. Undoubtedly,
the storage and loss moduli increased with increasing PBS content
in the blends, even without peroxide, which is ascribed to the enhanced
effect of PBS, which possesses higher melt moduli compared to the
other two components as shown in Figure 5a,b.

Figure 5 Frequency dependence of the rheology properties
for the compounding
samples with different blends: (a) storage modulus (G′), (b) loss modulus (G″), (c) loss
tangent (tan δ), and (d) complex viscosity (η).

The elastic effects of the ternary
blends became more significant
with the introduction of peroxide, reflected by the increased storage
moduli (Figure 5a)
and decreased tanδ (lower than 1) as shown in Figure 5c. With the introduction of
peroxide, the non-Newtonian low-frequency plateau of G′, which reflects some difficult relaxation internal structures
within a long-time scale, is observed, revealing that some molecular
networks formed in our melt blends, which is caused by the branching/cross-linking
reactions that happened in the system. The cross-linked or branching
networks in the ternary blends caused the improvement in the viscosity
of the blends, as shown in Figure 5d, especially in the low frequencies. Meanwhile, the
same viscosity of the samples with and without peroxide at high frequencies
ensures the processability of this material in high-shear processing
such as extrusion. The blends with peroxide exhibited shear-shinning
behavior in all testing frequencies, meaning the relaxation or disentanglement
of the molecular network in the whole time scale, from short- to long-time
relaxation. With the introduction of peroxide, the blends experience
a transition in behavior from liquid-like to gel-like, as revealed
by the tan δ in Figure 5c, indicating that the melt elasticity of the blends has been
greatly improved because of the branching or cross-linking of the
samples. More importantly, the enhanced melt modulus and viscosity
effect improved with increasing PBS/PBAT amounts in the blends, meaning
that the branching/cross-linking reaction mainly happened between
PBS/PBAT and peroxide. This is also verified by the gel contents as
shown in Figure S1; the gel contents increased
with PBS/PBAT amounts in the blends at the same peroxide concentration.
The gel content is as low as 0.9 wt % for the P-S40T20 blends with
0.3 phr peroxide, ensuring the processability of the designed materials.
As the gel content reaches 17.5 wt % with 0.75 phr peroxide, low dosage
of peroxide should be used in the designed blends to avoid the over-cross-linking.
Considering the important role of chain entanglement in the stretching
shape process and crack growth resistance, the enhanced elastic effect
and melt viscosity properties of the developed toughened PLA materials
show promising applications in film forming and thermoforming.

Toughening Mechanism
To visualize
the effects of peroxide
contents on the energy dissipation modes involved in the toughened
PLA materials, the impact fracture surfaces beyond the notch are examined
by SEM, as shown in Figure 6. As the blends with and without peroxide show huge differences
in impact strength, the SEM images of PLA/PBS/PBAT and PLA/PBS/PBAT/peroxide
0.3phr are shown here to clarify the reason for this. Compared to
the smooth fracture surface of the samples without peroxide, which
show lower impact strength, the blends with 0.3 phr peroxide exhibit
a rough fracture surface with improved signs of plastic deformation
(as shown in Figure 6). The observations of the impact surface are well consistent with
the corresponding impact strengths. It is suggested that the plastic
deformation in the matrix is mainly caused by the tough PBAT to absorb
the impact energy. This is the main reason why super tough blends
can be obtained in our study, the same as the observation in the previous
research of Ma et al.34 From the impact
fracture surface, no obvious PBAT debonding can be found in the tough
samples; this is because of the strong interfacial force between PBAT
and the matrix from the branching/cross-linking reaction. Previously,
it has been reported that the optimal particle size to induce internal
rubber cavitation is larger than 200 nm,35 and because of the higher intrinsic brittleness of PLA, it is reported
that the optimal particle size to toughen PLA is 0.5–0.9 μm.13d However, from the etching SEM photos shown
in Figure 7a, we calculate
that the mean diameter of the PBAT phase in the toughened blends is
around 210 nm (count from Image-Pro Plus software), which is close
to the critical particle size for internal rubber cavitation but far
lower than the optimal particle size for toughening PLA. However,
from the impact fracture surface shown in Figure 6, some tiny voids can be found in the toughened
samples without any sign of PBAT debonding, especially for P-S20T20-I0.3. It is suggested that the optimal particle size for internal
cavitation may decrease when we have some PBS to adjust the intrinsic
brittleness of the matrix. On the other hand, it is worth noting that
in the processing–structure–property relationship of
polymer blends, the interplay of factors (e.g., phase interface adhesion,
dispersed phase size, and composite ratios) could result in an enhancement
or deterioration of the mechanical properties.36 To clarify the effect of composite ratios and peroxide
on the phase interface and structure changes of the ternary blends,
we purposely fracture the samples in liquid nitrogen to avoid any
interference from the plastic deformation and take an SEM observation.

Figure 6 SEM images
of an impact fracture surface of the ternary blend with
various weight compositions.

Figure 7 Morphology characterization by SEM and rheology testing: (a) SEM
images of the ternary blends with and without peroxide, (b) Cole–Cole
plots for the neat polymer and their ternary blends with 0.3 phr and
without peroxide, and (c) the effect of the peroxide contents on the
Cole–Cole plots of the blends.

At 0.3 phr peroxide, the impact strength jumps from 37 J/m
for
P-S10T10-I0.3 to 728 J/m for P-S20T20-I0.3. Our further
studies show that the impact strength of PLA70/PBS20/PBAT10/peroxide
0.3 phr and PLA70/PBS10/PBAT20/peroxide 0.3 phr blends is 44 and 60
J/m (the data are shown in Figure S4),
respectively, exhibiting low toughness. It means that the toughness
of the blends is also influenced by the composition ratios in addition
to the improved interfacial compatibility. To clarify this, we etch
the PBAT in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and then observe the morphologies
of the blends by SEM as shown in Figure 7a. It is found that the dispersed PBAT changes
from droplet in P-S10T10 to co-continuous in P-S20T20; the rationality
on the dispersion of 20 wt% PBAT as a co-continuous structure in the
ternary blend is based on the partial compatibility of PBS and PBAT
because of their chemical structures.22 However, the SEM observation shows the co-continuous blend morphology
in the absence of peroxide versus droplet morphology in the presence
of peroxide, resulting from the increased viscosity of the dispersed
phase. The size of the PBAT droplet decreased dramatically to around
200 nm for P-S20T20-I0.3 and P-S40T20-I0.3.
As the main toughening agent, the PBAT phase with decreased dispersion
size is believed to be able to maximize the toughness enhancement
role of PBAT and lead to the sudden increase of the toughness in P-S20T20-I0.3. However, for P-S10T10-I0.3, the particle size
of PBAT shows no sign of decreasing and remains to be around 1–2
μm. That is why the toughness of the P-S10T10 cannot be improved
even after peroxide curing. Through decreasing the size of the toughening
droplet and taking advantage of the partial compatibility between
the toughening phases, for example, PBAT and PBS, high toughness materials
can be obtained with stiffness–toughness balance.

The
morphology structure evolution can also be verified from the
Cole–Cole plots from the rheology testing, which has been proven
to be sensitive to the phase structures in polymer blends.37 By depicting η″ versus η′,
the Cole–Cole plots of the different blends are shown in Figure 7b,c. As shown in Figure 7b, the only circular
arc in the curve of the pure polymers corresponds to the homogeneous
structure relaxation of PLA, PBS, and PBAT.37a After blending the three polymers together, a second circular arc
or a tail appears on the right-hand side of the curves based on different
composition ratios, corresponding to the different relaxation mechanisms.
The two peaks in the Cole–Cole plots indicated that the mixture
has undergone phase separation.38 At low
frequencies, the second circular arc of P-S10T10 is the sign of the
relaxation stemming from the deformation of the suspended droplets,39 meaning that a drop–matrix phase morphology
formed in the blend, whereas the tails in the high frequency of P-S20T20
and P-S40T20 correspond to a co-continuous phase relaxation, meaning
that a co-continuous phase structure has been formed in these blends.37a These rheological studies are well consistent
with the morphology observation by SEM. Interestingly; the Cole–Cole
plots did not show any relaxation arc or tail after peroxide is incorporated,
as shown in Figure 7c. They all show good linearity and are independent of the peroxide
concentrations. This is because the relaxation of the whole molecular
chain, whatever the composition or structure, has been greatly limited
after highly branching or cross-linking the polymer chains in the
presence of peroxide. The relaxation of the different phases cannot
be detected in our testing frequency ranges.

In summary, the
most probable toughening mechanism for PLA/PBS/PBAT/peroxide
with high impact strength is singled out to be tough PBAT-induced
plastic deformation in which the interface adhesions are significantly
improved in the presence of peroxide. With the increasing viscosity
of the toughening phase, which resulted from the reactive extrusion,
the PBAT phase transformed from co-continuous structures into “droplet”
structures with a decreased diameter. The decreased size of the toughening
phase is believed to improve the toughness of the blends dramatically.
According to Jalali’s research, a co-continuous structure formed
in the PLA/PBAT binary blends with 40/60, 50/50, and 60/40 composite
ratios.37c By structuring the PLA ternary
blends with PBS and PBAT, the co-continuous structure is found at
20 wt % PBAT via taking advantage of the compatibility between PBS
and PBAT. The decreased amount of toughening agent allows us to design
and fabricate materials with balanced stiffness–toughness properties.
Benefitting from the structure tailoring via reactive extrusion, our
research shows that a small amount of peroxide (0.3 phr) could improve
the toughness of the ternary blends with co-continuous structures
by improving the interface interactions and transforming the co-continuous
structure into a small-size droplet with strong adhesion to the matrix.

Radical Reaction Mechanism
The content of PLA and PBS/PBAT
in the gel (or blends) can be easily distinguished via thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) because of the large difference between the decomposition
temperatures of PLA (ca. 370 °C) and PBS/PBAT (ca. 400 °C)
and the decomposition temperature sensitivity of the PLA and the other
two polymers, as shown in Figure 8d. The content of PBS/PBAT in the initial blends of
P-S10T10 (no peroxide) is only 20 wt % (Figure 8a); however, it is much higher (ca. 55 wt
%) in the extracted gel of the P-S10T10-I0.5 blend (Figure 8a), indicating that
the main reaction happened between peroxide and PBS/PBAT. The TGA
results of the extracted gels indicated that only 45% PLA exists in
the gels, which decreased a lot compared to the initial blending ratio
of PLA (80 wt %). The same phenomenon can be observed in the P-S20T20-I0.5 and P-S40T20-I0.5 blends, as shown in Figure 8b,c. The PLA contents
in the extracted gels are 50 wt % for P-S20T20-I0.5 and
32 wt % for P-S40T20-I0.5. Unfortunately, the contents
of the PBS and PBAT in the gels cannot be measured because of the
close decomposition temperature of these two materials. It can be
found that only one DTG peak is observed for PBS and PBAT in all blends.
The undissolved gel part is believed to be the highly entangled cross-linking
polymer chains. This means that PLA, PBS, and PBAT chain segments
are highly entangled together interacting as copolymers. The Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of the extracted gel of P-S40T20-I0.75 is given in Figure S5. It can
be found that the extracted gel shows characteristic peaks of PLA
(−C=O at 1715 cm–1), PBS (−C–O
at 806 cm–1), and PBAT (out-of-plane bending of
=C–H in the benzene ring at 731 cm–1),40 verifying the existence of the copolymers.
Except for the gel content calculation, the DTG curves also provide
us thermal stability information of the blends. It can be found that
the thermal degradation temperatures of the blends, including the
initial and maximum degradation temperatures, are almost unchanged
with or without peroxide, independent of peroxide concentrations.
This is because even though the polymer chains are branched/cross-linked
with the introduction of peroxide, the bond energy of −C–C–
or −C–O– is not influenced. Meanwhile, the thermal
degradation temperatures of the polymers in TGA testing are mainly
decided by their bond energy.

Figure 8 TGA curves of the compounding samples with different
composition
ratios and pure PLA, PBS, and PBAT: (a) P-S10T10-Ix, (b) P-S20T20-Ix, (c) P-S40T20-Ix, and (d) neat PLA, PBS, and PBAT.

The above phenomena of the dependence of gel contents
on composition
ratios by gel calculation as shown in Figure S1 and TGA testing indicated that the reactions initiated by peroxide
during the extrusion mainly happened between the PBS and PBAT components.
To demonstrate the reaction priorities and possible reaction mechanism,
we conducted a qualitative testing on the gel formation between these
three polymers and peroxide by rheology testing. An in situ reaction
between the polymer and the peroxide is conducted on a rheometer at
175 °C under small dynamic frequencies, and the dependence of
the moduli on reaction time is depicted in Figure 9. The gel point here is qualitatively defined
as the instant time at which the complex moduli, G′ and G″, cross each other.41 It can be found that the gel reaction happened
quickly in PBS/peroxide (∼88 s) and PBAT/peroxide (∼156
s), whereas no gel formation occurred in the PLA/peroxide sample in
a small-amplitude oscillatory shear, meaning the higher capacity of
PBS and PBAT for developing radical reactions with peroxide than that
of PLA. This is ascribed to the higher content of mobile H atoms on
the CH2 groups of PBS and PBAT, whereas PLA has only a
methyl, which is not active, or methyne hydrogen, which is sterically
hindered and gives a rather stable free radical. However, the PLA
gels and copolymer of PLA–PBS–PBAT still exist in the
final reaction products according to the TGA analysis and compatibility
by SEM. This is supposed to the chain scission of PLA under high shear
processing involving oxygen. The formation of the PLA gels can occur
through the reaction of macroradicals, such as PLA–O–O·, and that of the copolymers can occur through the reaction
of macroradicals PBS·, PBAT· or PBS–O–O·, and PBAT–O–O· with PLA–O–O.
This is a qualitative discussion because the gel point can only be
detected by this method only when the relaxation exponent of the gel
is equal to .41 However,
from the qualitative comparison, the possible reaction mechanism in
this ternary blends is given by us as follows:(1) Peroxide preferentially reacts with
PBS and PBAT chains, extracting the secondary hydrogen from the CH2 group of PBS/PBAT to yield free radicals (PBS· and PBAT·) on the main chain of PBS or PBAT.

(2) The reaction between PLA
and peroxide
mainly happens between the fragmentation chains of PLA because of
the high shear and thermal decomposition in the presence of oxygen
and free radicals of peroxide to form PLA–O–O·.

(3) Finally, the cross-linked/branched
structures of PLA, PBS, or PBAT via homogeneous radical coupling and
copolymers via radical coupling reactions between the macroradicals
PBS·, PBAT· or PBS–O–O·, and PBAT–O–O with PLA–O–O
are formed.

Conclusions
Super tough biodegradable ternary blends
from PLA, PBS, and PBAT
were successfully prepared by a simple melt reactive blending method.
The super tough PLA/PBS/PBAT ternary blend exhibiting a high impact
strength of ∼900 J/m with hinge break impact behavior was obtained
by optimizing the blending ratio of PBS and PBAT with a small amount
of peroxide. The small amount of peroxide can effectively improve
the impact strength of the blends with 40% PBS and 20% PBAT to ∼1000
J/m, 10 times that of the blend with the same composition without
peroxide and 30 times that of pure PLA. Meanwhile, the existence of
PLA ensures the high bio-contents of the blend with modulus above
1 GPa and strength above 30 MPa. The interfacial interaction and compatibility
of the different phases have been greatly improved because of the
robust reactivity between the biodegradable polymer and peroxide through
the SEM and rheology analysis. The gap between the different phases
disappeared with the incorporation of the optimized content of peroxide.
More importantly, by structuring such ternary blends, we can obtain
co-continuous structures at low PBAT contents (20 wt %) via taking
advantage of the partial compatibility between PBS and PBAT. The reduced
amount of toughening agent allows us to design and fabricate materials
with balanced stiffness–toughness properties. The influence
of peroxide on the thermal properties of the blends was studied by
DSC. The slight decline of Tg of the PLA
and increase of the Tg of PBS/PBAT in
the presence of peroxide indicated the improved compatibility by the
reactive extrusion. On the other hand, the melting point of PLA and
PBS both decreased because of the imperfect crystals formed in the
blends, which resulted from the limited chain movement by branching/cross-linking.
On the basis of the gel content calculations, a qualitative study
on the gel formation of the prepared bioblends by rheology testing
revealed the possible reaction mechanism between these three biopolymers
with peroxide. It is supposed that peroxide preferentially reacted
with the CH2 group of PBS/PBAT to yield free radicals,
whereas the reaction between the PLA and peroxide is very difficult
and mainly happens between the decomposition chains of PLA, oxygen,
and free radicals of peroxide during the process. Discussion on the
reaction mechanism will allow us to further optimize the in situ extrusion
reaction, which is widely used in industrial applications. This sustainable
super toughened PLA bioblends with significantly high impact strength
holds a promising application to substitute petroleum-based plastics.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
In this work, we use NatureWorks PLA with
the brand name Ingeo Biopolymer 4043D. The PBS (Tunhe TH803s) and
PBAT (Tunhe TH801t) used in this study are obtained from Xinjiang
Blueridge Tunhe Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. The peroxide initiator,
that is, 2,5-bis(tert-butyl peroxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane
(Luperox 101) with a half-life of 1 min at 177 °C is purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used here. PLA, PBS, and PBAT pellets are dried
in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h before melt blending. Chloroform
(CHCl3), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and acetone are purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.

Bioblend Fabrication
Melt blending is performed using
a co-rotating twin screw extruder (Leistritz Micro-27, Germany) with
a screw diameter of 27 mm and an L/D ratio of 48. The screw speed is set at 100 rpm, and the melt-zone
temperatures are set to 175 °C. For all ternary blends, the feeding
rate is fixed at 5 kg/h to make sure that the residence time of the
materials in the extruder is about 60 s. For homogeneous mixing and
effective use of the small amount of peroxide, we used a solution
of peroxide in acetone, added it to the dried polymer matrix, and
then mechanically mixed them, followed by feeding to the extruder
for melt processing. The blend formulations and codes are shown in Table 2. Here, we use “P”
to represent PLA, “S” for PBS, “T” for
PBAT, and “I” for the peroxide initiator, which are
followed by numbers indicating the contents of PBS, PBAT, and peroxide.
For example, P-S10T10-Ix indicates a formulation
of 80 wt % PLA, 10 wt % PBS, and 10 wt % PBAT with x (x = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.75) phr peroxide initiator.
After being oven-dried, the extruded pellets are injection-molded
using a micro 15 cm3 co-rotating twin screw compounder
and a micro 12 cm3 injection molding machine (manufactured
by DSM Research, Netherlands) into ASTM-standard specimens at a melting
temperature of 190 °C and a molding temperature of 30 °C.
The processing is conducted at a filling pressure of 8 bar and a packing
pressure of 8 bar with a screw speed of 100 rpm for 2.5 min (including
feeding time). All mechanical test specimens are conditioned for 2
days at 23 °C and 50% RH before mechanical testing and characterization.

Characterization Methods
Rheology
The rheology
behaviors of the compounded materials
are studied using a rheometer (Anton-Paar MCR-302 Instrument). The
frequency-dependent rheology behavior of all of the samples is monitored
at 175 °C and 1% strain under N2 protection. The samples
for rheological studies are injected into a disk with a diameter of
25 mm and a thickness of 1 mm at 180 °C using a micro 15 cm3 DSM injection molding machine (DSM Research, Netherlands).

The in situ reaction among the biodegradable polymers (PLA, PBS,
and PBAT) and peroxide initiator in the rheometer is conducted by
time sweeping at 175 °C, 1% strain, and 1 Hz under N2 protection. The samples are prepared by dispersing the diluted peroxide/acetone
solutions (0.2 g/30 mL) on the injected plastic disks, followed by
the evaporation of acetone at 25 °C in a fume hood.

DSC
The thermal properties of the blends are determined
on a DSC instrument (TA Q200, USA) under a N2 atmosphere.
The samples are heated to 180 °C at 10 °C/min and maintained
for 3 min before cooling to −70 °C at 10 °C/min.
The second heating scans are monitored between −70 to 180 °C
at 10 °C/min for determining the glass-transition temperature
(Tg), cold crystallization temperature
(Tcc), melting temperature (Tm), and crystallinity (Xc).
Such studies are targeted to investigating the influence of peroxide
on the crystallization behavior of the blends.

The crystallinity
of PBS (XPBS) is calculated based on the
melting enthalpy of PBS (ΔHPBS)
occurring at ∼112 °C and the weight ratio of PBS (WPBS), as illustrated in eq 1. 1  where ΔHm is the melting enthalpy of PBS, ΔHm° is the melting enthalpy assuming
100% crystalline
PBS (220 J/g here),42 and wf is the weight fraction of PBS in the blend.

The
crystallinity of PLA (XPLA) is
calculated based on the melting enthalpy (ΔHPLA), the cold crystallization enthalpy of PLA (ΔHcPLA), and the weight ratio of PLA (WPLA), as illustrated in eq 2. 2  where the ΔHm′ and ΔHc are the melting enthalpies and cold crystallization
enthalpies of PLA, ΔHm° is the melting enthalpy assuming
100% crystalline PLA (93.7 J/g here),43 and wf′ is the weight fraction
of PLA in the blend.

Thermal Stability Testing
The thermal
stability of
the blends and extracted gels are tested by TGA (TA Q500) from 30
to 500 °C at 10 °C /min under N2. The first derivative
of the TGA curves (DTG curves) is obtained from the TA2000 software.

SEM
The morphology of the blends is observed by SEM
with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV (Hitachi S-570). The samples
are fractured in liquid nitrogen and obtained from the notched Izod
impact test, which are sputtered with gold first and then observed
by SEM.

Gel Content Calculations
The gel contents of the blends
are calculated by a dissolution–extraction method according
to ASTM D2765. The polymer is sealed in stainless steel wire mesh
and dissolved in chloroform for 24 h. After the extraction, the undissolved
parts are left in the fume hood for 3 h and then transferred into
a vacuum oven at 40 °C to remove the chloroform. The residue
of the insoluble polymer is weighed and reported as wt % gel content.

Mechanical Property Tests
The tensile and flexure properties
of the samples are tested using an Instron 3382 according to the ASTM
standards D638 and D790, respectively. The Izod impact strength of
notched samples is tested using a Testing Machine Inc. (TMI) instrument
according to ASTM D256. In all mechanical tests, five samples were
tested, and the mean and standard deviation results are reported.

FTIR Spectroscopy
The gel extracted from the dissolution
testing is characterized using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectrometer equipped with a smart orbit ATR (Nicolet 6700, Thermo
Scientific).
