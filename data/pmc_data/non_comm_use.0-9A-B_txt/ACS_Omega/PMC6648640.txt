Crystal structures
of a rhodamine derivative in its closed and
open spirolactam ring forms were developed, which allows selective
and sensitive detection of Cu2+ ions at a micromolar range
in neutral medium. The chemosensing properties of the probe through
a pentacoordinate Cu2+ ions were proven by spectroscopic
and theoretical analysis. The spirolactam ring opening as the Cu2+ selective sensor was applied to spinach (Spinacia oleracea) to estimate the accumulation of
copper as copper(II) in the plant.

1 Introduction
Copper
(Cu) holds the position of the third most abundant essential
trace element just after iron and zinc.1−4 Certain level of copper is crucial to the
health of animals, ranging from bacteria to mammals, as well as the
plant kingdom.5 In the animal body system,
copper’s potent redox activities let it play the vital role
in haemopoiesis and iron absorption and as a catalytic cofactor for
various metalloenzymes, including Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, cytochrome c oxidase, and tyrosinase.6,7 According to
the World Health Organization (1996), average copper requirements
are 50 μg/kg and about 12.5 μg/kg of body weight per day
for infants and adults, respectively.8 Possession
of abnormal level of copper in living body systems may consequent
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease,
Wilson’s disease, Menke’s disease, liver or kidney damage,
prion diseases, oxidative stress, familial amyotropic lateral sclerosis,
and can boost up many other diseases, even cancer.9−14 In living plant systems, the presence of copper is found to be in
the range of 0.05–0.5 ppm for a growing medium, whereas in
most tissues, the normal range is between 3 and 10 ppm.15 Copper is essential in the process of photosynthesis,
plant respiration, plant metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins,
and in several enzyme systems including the enzymes which are involved
in lignin synthesis.16−18 This trace element can also intensify flavor and
color in vegetables and flowers. The elevated level of copper in a
growing plant medium produces reactive oxygen species, which has the
power to reduce protective enzyme activity, photosynthesis, growth,
to cause ion leakage in cell membranes, and can even lead to death
of the medium.19−24 Free Cu2+ are considered as the most toxic form of copper
to organisms and to the environment. The malignant behavior of Cu2+ imposes a strong need for a reliable practical sensing method
to selectively detect Cu2+ ions in the living system. Among
the various analytical methods, fluorescence chemosensors attract
much more attention because of their simplicity, selectivity, low-cost,
and real-time sensing.25−27 To fulfill the purpose of a fluorescence turn-on
chemosensor, rhodamine dyes are widely used due to their excellent
spectroscopic properties, such as long wavelength excitation and emission
profiles, large extinction coefficients, high fluorescence quantum
yields, and the intense pink coloration after spirolactam ring opening.28−30 Thus far, the work done for Cu2+ sensing is mainly accomplished
in live cell systems (comparison Table S1). We have now focused on plant tissues, which are one of the main
sources of Cu2+ accumulation in animals.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Plausible Mechanism
Inspired by previous
studies, we propose a mechanism where our chemosensor QRA (quinoline rhodamine acetamide) in its closed form first coordinates
with copper perchlorate to form a fluorescent intermediate pentacoordinate QRA–Cu2+ complex (see the Supporting Information computations), which upon hydration
loses the copper ion to form the stable fluorescent QRA in the open form (Scheme 1). A strong π–π stacking between the quinoline
and xanthene moieties at a distance of ca. −3.4 Å (see
the following X-ray structures) counts for the exceptional stability
of the open form of the QRA. We managed to get single
crystals of moderate diffraction quality from both forms, QRA-closed and QRA-open, by diffusing petroleum ether into an
acetonitrile solution of QRA-closed/open in a closed
vessel.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism of Interaction between QRA and
Cu2+ in Neutral Aqueous Medium
2.2 Crystallographic Studies
The X-ray
structure (Figure 1a) of the QRA-closed reveals the nonfluorescent edge-to-face
orientation of the xanthene and quinoline moieties (Figure S4), where the center of the quinoline ring is 6.5
Å away from the center of the xanthene ring. The spirolactam
ring opening in QRA-open manifests a huge conformational
change. The quinoline ring moves ca. 2 Å, twists ca. 70°,
and slides under the xanthene moiety, resulting in a very strong coplanar
π–π stacking interaction at 3.4 Å of the xanthene
and quinoline rings (Figures 1b and S5).

Figure 1 ORTEP plots of QRA-closed (a) and QRA-open (b), the perchlorate
ions and lattice waters in QRA-open are omitted for clarity.
The thermal ellipsoids are drawn at the
50% probability level.

2.3 Spectral Behavior of QRA
To demonstrate
the interactions between the probe QRA and Cu2+ ions, absorbance and fluorescence titrations were carried out in
CH3CN–H2O (1:8, v/v) at neutral pH (pH
7.2, 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer). A 10 μM solution of QRA was titrated against some known concentrations of Cu2+, where the maximum absorbance and fluorescence were observed after
addition of 30 μM of copper (3 equiv). The spectra shows a decreased
absorbance at 312 nm followed by an increasing absorbance at 530 nm
with a notable isosbestic point at 334 nm (Figure 2a), which is probably due to π–π*
transition from the quinoline to xanthene moiety. Fluorimetric analysis
curve upon excitation at 530 nm, showed a 130-fold hike in fluorescence
at 574 nm (Figure 2b). The comparative spectrophotometric response of QRA was also studied in various biologically relevant cations (Figure S6) and different analytes (Figure S7), which confirmed the sensitivity (full
fluorescence signal within 2 min) (Figure S8) and high selectivity of the probe toward Cu2+, both
in solution and solid phase (Figure S9).
Binding interactions determine 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of QRA and Cu2+ in the Job’s plot (Figure S10).31 The probe QRA has a detection limit of 2.2 μM for Cu2+ ion (Figure S11).32

emission spectra (λex = 530 nm) of QRA (10 μM) after addition of Cu2+ upto 3 equiv (inset)
visual and fluorescence changes after addition of Cu2+.

2.4 pH Titration
It is very important
to maintain the pH of the medium while working with rhodamine derivatives.
That is why we performed the pH titration of the probe QRA with Cu2+. It clearly reflects the nondependence of QRA on the pH range of 7–8 for copper(II) detection
(Figure S12).

2.5 NMR Spectroscopic
Titration
1H NMR titration (CD3CN)
reveals that the aromatic
protons of probe QRA shifted upfield abruptly and became
broader upon addition of 1 equiv Cu2+, which represents
the increase in electron density of the xanthene ring (Figure S13). In 13C NMR titration,
the more significant spiro cycle carbon peak at 70.75 ppm is shifted
to 131.09 ppm (Figure S14). These coordinations
led to the changes from closed to an open spiro cycle in the absorption-emission
spectra and a sharp electronic transition from quinoline to the xanthene
moiety.

2.6 Theoretical Analysis
Potential energy
surfaces of the three structures, that is, QRA closed, QRA–Cu2+, and QRA open were optimized using DFT at CAM-B3LYP level using the 6-31G**/LANL2DZ
basis set and CPCM (water) solvent model.33 From Figure S15, it has been shown that
Cu2+ ions forms a pentacoordinated complex with QRA in its most-stabilized geometry with the N and O centers of QRA along with water molecules. The energy of QRA open was minimized by an amount of 37.65 kcal/mol from the initial
closed structure of QRA (Table S2). The aforesaid spectroscopic and theoretical analysis corroborates
with our proposed mechanism.

2.7 Imaging and Estimation
Accumulation
of the copper(II) ion was instigated in Indian spinach (Spinacia oleracea, family: Amaranthaceae), the stem
and leaf of which are a popular vegetable throughout the globe. A
7-days old sapling was taken for the study. Initially, it was kept
in a neutral aqueous solution of 10 mM copper perchlorate for a week,
followed by 10 mM aqueous solution of QRA for another
week. Then, the transverse sections of three different parts, that
is, root, stem, and leaf were done and collected separately in three
Petri dishes, and each section was observed under a confocal microscope.

The images in Figure 3 represent that the copper(II) ion was mainly absorbed through the
xylem tissue of the root showing the highest fluorescence signal,
whereas the pith and endodermis region displayed negligible fluorescence.
In the stem, intense fluorescence response from the vascular bundle
and in the leaf and relatively lower fluorescence from the collenchyma
cell region is observed. The exact concentration of accumulated Cu2+ ions in the sapling has been estimated with the help of
standard fluorescence spectra, which measure 20, 12.6, and 7.8 μM
of copper ion in root, stem, and leaf, respectively (Figure 4).

followed by treatment with a 10 mM QRA solution in acetonitrile–water

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we can say
that to the best of our knowledge this
is the first report where we developed a rare crystal structure of
rhodamine derivative (QRA) with an open spirolactam ring. QRA can selectively recognize Cu2+ in aqueous medium
with very low concentration. The selective turn-on sensing of QRA toward Cu2+ was successfully demonstrated in
a spinach sapling to estimate the concentration of copper(II) ions
present in the root, stem, and leaf of that sapling. More interestingly,
this unique chemosensing method can easily estimate Cu2+ without abstracting it from the tested sample.

4 Experimental
Details
4.1 Materials and Methods
Rhodamine B,
ethylenediamine, bromoacetyl chloride, 8-hydroxyquinoline, copper(II)
perchlorate, and other metal salts were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Pvt. Ltd. (India). All other materials were obtained from local suppliers
and used without further purification. Solvents were dried according
to standard procedures. Crystal structures were diffracted in a Bruker
Single Crystal X-ray diffractometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz instrument. For NMR
spectra and NMR titration, CDCl3 and CD3CN were
used as solvents, using an internal standard of trimethylsilane. Chemical
shifts are expressed in δ ppm units. 1H–1H and 1H–C coupling constants are denoted
in Hz. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was carried out using
a micromass Q-TOF Micro instrument. Fluorescence and absorbance spectra
were recorded on a PerkinElmer model LS55 and SHIMADZU UV-3101PC spectrophotometers,
respectively. Elemental analysis was carried out on PerkinElmer 2400
series CHNS/O Analyzer. The following abbreviations are used to describe
spin multiplicities in 1H NMR spectra: s = singlet; d =
doublet; t = triplet; m = multiplet.

For confocal microscopy,
a Leica TCS SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope system was used.
Images obtained through section scanning were analyzed by the LasX
software with excitation at 530 nm monochromatic laser beam, and emission
spectra were integrated over the range 574 nm (single channel) with
10× magnification.

4.2 Synthesis and Characterization
of QRA
The probe QRA was synthesized by the
reaction between
8-hydroxyquinoline and a 2-bromoacetamide substituent of rhodamine
B (2) following a previously published report from our
lab (detailed synthesis of compound 2 from rhodamine
B has been described in the Supporting Information).32 To a solution of anhydrous K2CO3 (0.57 g, 4 mmol) in dry acetone was added 8-hydroxyquinoline
(0.3 g, 2 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h, followed by addition
of compound 2 (1.25 g, 2 mmol) to the solution and subsequent
refluxing for 24 h (Figure 5). Then, the reaction mixture was poured into cold water.
The solution was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 ×
50 mL), and the combined organic layer was washed with 5% aqueous
HCl (50 mL), 10% aqueous Na2CO3 (50 mL), and
finally with water and then was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After evaporating the solvents, the residue was column chromatographed
on silica gel (60–120 mesh) with chloroform/ethyl acetate =
3:1 v/v as the eluent to give 1 g (78%) of QRA as a white
powder. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ (ppm)
