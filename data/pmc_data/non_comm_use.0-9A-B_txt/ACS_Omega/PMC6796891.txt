Nanocrystalline coordination polymers (NCCPs) have been considered
as an incredible electrochemical sensor for the effective detection of biologically dynamic drug 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP).
In the present report, a significantly stable infinite arrayed coordination
polymeric network was self-assembled via metal with efficient organic
tecton 4-amino-3-hydrazino-5-mercapto-1,2,4,-triazole (AHMT) in which
silver(I) ions are coordinated by AHMT via hydrazino and exocyclic
thiol linkage to form AHMT-Ag NCCP. An efficient and highly sensitive
detection of 6-MP is attained owing to eminent electron channeling
via polymeric nanocrystallite pores. An effective charge transfer
leads to an interface of the AHMT-Ag nano-pores and electrolyte anchored
electrode via π–π electron coupling and hydrophobic
interaction. The voltammogram exposes acute redox behavior of 6-MP
and discloses an impeccable illustration for the AHMT-Ag facilitated
oxidation of 6-MP. This unique signature was applied in voltammetric
detection of 6-MP in blood serum, human urine, and pharmaceutical
formulation (tablet) by a considerable high sensitivity of 0.074,
0.058, and 0.036 μA/μM and a detection limit of 87, 97,
and 37 nM, respectively. Thus, the prepared AHMT-Ag NCCP can provide
a valuable platform for fabrication of highly sensitive electrochemical
devices to assay biologically essential drug molecules.

1 Introduction
Nanocrystalline coordination polymers-(NCCPs) are an attractive
class of tailorable material and exhibit outstanding properties that
expands the scope in various areas.1 The
significant research interest in the domain of these important scaffold
are due to their specific size, structural regularity, high surface
area, high porosity, design ability, and easy tunability results to
a larger potential in different applications.2−5 Nano size of these crystalline
coordination polymeric regimes are of large significance in catalysis,
thin film devices, and drug delivery.6,7 Owing to these features recent
research affords for the sketch of fashionable organization of metal
ions with organic tecton results with a huge potential for various
applications.8−10 Geometry and coordination manner of organic tecton
and metal center affects the properties and structure of NCCP, other
secondary interactions, such as hydrogen bonding also results in the
versatile properties of NCCPs.11,12 In this regard, 4-amino-3-hydrazino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole
(AHMT), an efficient organic tecton used for the production of functional
NCCP. Nitrogen and sulfur atoms facilitate coordination of organic
tecton with a metal ion throughout the arrangement to create a functional
structure. Because of structural tailorability of the organic tecton
and capability to regulate the assembly with a metal ion at the nanoextent,
they have fascinating applications in energy storage,13 catalysis,14 adsorption,15 efficient contrast agents,16 biotechnology,17 nanofluids,18 gas separation,19 chemical sensing,20,21 light harvesting,22 device formation23 and drug delivery,24 selective catalysis,25 fuel cells,26 and
so forth. The prominent interactions are metal–ligand interactions
that create extra strong entities. Furthermore, the π–π
stacking between polymer chains that inter- and intra-hydrogen bonding
direct toward an organization and definite alignment of these structures.27

In the view of the above particulars, our research interest is
preparation of unique nanosized coordination polymers with reasonable
organic building blocks and electrochemical sensing of frequently
used drugs; here we first time explore the development of AHMT-Ag
NCCPs with an identical crystalline structure, high solvent dispersibility,
and electrochemical activity for sensing application.

AHMT-Ag NCCP was formulated under optimal conditions at ambient
temperature without any additional supplements. The optimization of
reactant concentration is executed while synthesis and monitored by
using appropriate characterization techniques. During synthesis the
Ag(I) ions coordinate to nitrogen and sulfur atoms of the linker resulting
in exceptional capability requisite for molecular amendment of the
inner pore architecture. Thus, NCCPs cover huge advantages for the
valuable application. This platform is advantageous for various sensing
applications because of its multiple binding sites.

At present there is a number of lifesaving drugs frequently used
every day, when their amount exceeds above a certain level it causes
toxicity. 6-Meracaptopurine (6-MP), an excessively important immunosuppressive
drug, is used in anticancer chemotherapy for dealing acute lymphoblastic
leukemia and inflammatory bowel disease. Generally, the 6-MP concentration
was found to be unpredictably high and low variable in plasma, with
manifest individual differences. Hence, it is very essential to monitor
the concentration of 6-MP.28

Numerous approaches have been devoted for the detection of 6-MP
in biological preparation and pharmaceutical comprising capillary
electrophoresis,29 high-performance liquid
chromatography,30 laser-induced fluorescence,31 spectrofluorimetry,32 and chemiluminescence.33 However, these
methods require tedious experimentation. Electrochemical approaches
have shown notable advantages in the investigation of drugs in human
urine and pharmaceutical preparations. These methods in pharmaceutical
analysis are studied owing to their accuracy and precision, low cost,
simplicity and rapidity, sensitivity.

In this research work, the voltammetric method have been applied
to depict the electrochemical nature of 6-MP on the carbon paste electrode
(CPE) in the presence of highly electro-active AHMT-Ag NCCP as a suitable
nanosensor in phosphate buffer (pH 7). Further, the developed sensor
was also effectively explored to assay 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in
real samples of blood serum, urine and tablet.

2 Results and Discussion
The coordination polymer AHMT-Ag is a remarkably symmetrical architecture
which provides coordination position for bonding and construct a well-predictable
network with various interactions and unique capacity to frame π
stacking all over aromatic array. Here, sulfur and nitrogen atoms
of AHMT coordinated with Ag(I) into a huge array of polymeric chain.
The synthesized AHMT-Ag was characterized by UV–visible spectroscopy,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), 1H NMR,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), high-resolution
scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM), energy-dispersive system (EDS)
mapping, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), and thermal study.

2.1 Materials Characterizations
The FT-IR spectrum of AHMT
shows various bands in the region 3270–2930 because of ν(N–H)
and ν(NH2). The peak broadness recommends intramolecular
hydrogen bonding (Figure 1I). The vibrational band at 3209 cm–1 is
initiated because of ν(NH–NH2) of AHMT and
remarkably attenuated to 3095 cm–1 in AHMT-Ag, spotting
the connection of the exocyclic NH–NH2 with Ag.
Additionally, the S–H stretching of AHMT evidenced at 2789
cm–1disappeared in AHMT-Ag; which indicates thiol
ionization, bonding of sulfur via the silver atom. The thioamide band
I at 1501 cm–1 in AHMT appeared at a higher wave
number 1633 cm–1 in AHMT-Ag caused by a decrease
in the major contributor ν(N–H), and a substantial increase
in the minor contributor ν(C=N), respectively, because
of sulfur and silver bonding. Furthermore, typical thioamide band
II 1315–1346 cm–1 in AHMT with the significant
contributor ν(C=N) increased considerably to 1365 cm–1 in AHMT-Ag, encouraging the bonding of silver with
sulfur.

AHMT-Ag.

Further XRD was executed in order to investigate the crystal structure.
The XRD of AHMT-Ag and AHMT were correlated with Ag(0) attained from
the JCPDS file (CAS number 87-0720). AHMT-Ag displays the crystalline
nature as shown in S2 Figure S2. It is
noticeable that structural characteristics of AHMT and Ag(0) are absent
in AHMT-Ag. The crystallographic phase of AHMT-Ag, NCCP was examined
at room temperature by XRD with a diffraction angle between 5°
and 80°. The, DICVOL04.51 (auto-indexing program) was employed
to index the XRD pattern of AHMT-Ag.34 It
was found that experimental diffraction peaks could be indexed using
monoclinic, orthorhombic, and triclinic cells. In order to determine
the correct crystallographic symmetry for the observed XRD spectra,
AHMT-Ag was investigated by Le-Bail refinement through FullProf35 for different probable crystal structures; for
example, orthorhombic Pnma, monoclinic P21/m, Pm, and triclinic
P1 space groups. It shows that the triclinic crystal structure has
the closest fit between the calculated and experimentally observed
profiles of AHMT-Ag with a good figure of merit, and it indexed all
the diffraction peaks. Figure 1II reveals the experimentally observed data point which are
indicated with dotted red circles, while the calculated pattern is
shown as a continuous solid line and the variation of the observed
from calculated pattern is shown by the continuous bottom green line
obtained by the Le-Bail fit for space group “triclinic P1”.
The vertical lines indicate the Bragg peak locations in the difference
plot. From Figure 1II it can be clearly observed that the diffraction peaks emerge in
the pattern representing a good crystalline nature of synthesized
AHMT-Ag NCCP. The triclinic cell has the lattice parameters a = 11.055(1), b = 4.4964(1), c = 5.6471 (2), α = 91.62(4), β = 93.34(1), and γ
= 90.28(2) and a unit cell volume 280.30(1) A3. The crystallinity
of AHMT-Ag is again examined by selected area diffraction of transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). The diffraction peaks of AHMT-Ag are indexed.
The absorption spectra difference shows the interaction effect of
metal (S3 Figure S3). AHMT has remarkable
a absorbance at 360 nm, and the fellow AHMT-Ag reveals a characteristic
absorbance at 270 nm. Signature of hypsochromic shift in the absorbance spectra is because the
interaction between AHMT and Ag. XPS enlightens the chemical environment
of the elements in AHMT-Ag and the oxidation state of the Ag center.
The fitted peaks using software, XPS peak 4.1 (Figure 2) imparts two doublets fitted for Ag (3d).
The specific peak at 376.2 eV is the centered feature peak of the
3d3/2 Ag(I),36 meanwhile the
peak at 370.4 eV is the signature of the 3d5/2 Ag(I) supporting
the oxidation state of silver. N (1s) peaks deliver 5 sets of the
singlet in which the peak at 403.7 eV corresponds to the binding energy
of endocyclic amine nitrogen (=N−). Binding energy of
402.7 eV attributed to −NH groups, superior binding energy
acquainted to the bonding of silver with nitrogen of −NH. Additionally
binding energy at 400.6, 402.1, and 401.4 eV correspond to nitrogen
of −NH2, C–N–C, and C–NH–37,38 The binding energy at 164.6 eV appears because of sulfur (2p3/2). A variation of binding energy favors coordination of
the silver atom with exocyclic sulfur. Binding energy at 287.8 and
286.8 eV denotes that the C (1s) spectrum for the suitable fit analogous
to N=C–N– and −N=C–S–
bonding.39

Figure 2 XPS spectra of AHMT-Ag for Ag (3d), N (1s), S (2p), and C (1s)
regions.

The 1H NMR spectrum of AHMT has signals at 12.8 that
have significance for the ring NH, 7.13 for NH of the NHNH2, 5.4 for SH, and 5.264 ppm for NH2 of the NHNH2 protons relative to TMS. The absence of signal because the SH proton
in AHMT-Ag NCCP establishes the bonding of silver through sulfur.
The peak that appeared at 4.10 ppm is because of the NH2 of NNH2 in AHMT-Ag. The peak of NHNH2 and
NH observed at a lower field, that is, 5.265 and 7.135 ppm, respectively,
in AHMT-Ag furnishes bonding of silver with the NHNH2 group
of AHMT. The signal corresponding to the S=C–NH proton
at 8.406 diminishes in AHMT-Ag NCCP which may be because of bonding
of the metal with the sulfur atom of C–S. The doublet at 5.438
also vanished in AHMT-Ag assigning interaction of the metal with the
NH2 group of NH–NH2 . The signal
corresponding to N–NH2 remained in AHMT-Ag emphasizes
the unreacted proton of the amino group (S4 Figure S4).

The morphology and elemental investigation of AHMT-Ag, explored
by the HR-TEM, HR-SEM, and SAED pattern shown in Figure 4 provokes
a crystalline nanoglobular shaped network structure (S5 Figure S5). The average particle size distribution
of AHMT-Ag NCCP was analyzed with Image J software and it shows an
average size 20–30 nm (Figure 4c). The irregular nanoglobules profile of the distinct
AHMT-Ag was also captured in the HR-TEM micrograph Figure 4a,b. The SAED pattern illustrates
the crystalline nature of the AHMT-Ag network (Figure 4d). The corresponding EDX measurements reveals
the elemental composition of AHMT-Ag and verifies the presence of
S,N, C, and Ag atoms in the selected area as presented in S6 Figure S6. The EDS mapping illustrate the elemental
composition of AHMT-Ag. Here, the overlap image discloses homogeneous
distribution of Ag, C, N, and S signifying the formation of the dense
polymeric chain. The consequent images (S7 Figure. S7) reveal the mapping of discrete elements and evidences the
higher nitrogen concentration.

Figure 3 Three possible structures of the AHMT dimer coordinated with the
Ag atom obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G**+LanL2DZ level of theory in water
solvent.

Figure 4 HR TEM of AHMT-Ag (a,b), size distribution graph from the TEM image
(c) and corresponding the SAED pattern (d).

Moreover, the molecular modeling is implemented to achieve the
favored orientation of the ligand in the network which certifies antialignment,
the favored orientation. (S8 Figure S8)

Furthermore, there could be three possible ways for coordination
of Ag with ligand 4-amino-3-hydrazino-5-mercapto-1,2,4,-triazole (AHMT).
Density functional theory (DFT) study was executed in order to assess
the most probable way of interaction. Two ligand units were under
investigation with the metal. Geometries of all the dimers were optimized
in a water solvent using the B3LYP40 functional
and LanL2DZ basis set for the Ag atom and the 6–31g** basis
set for the rest of the atoms. The genuineness of the calculated structures
was confirmed by visually examining the vibrational modes related
to all real vibration frequencies. All the calculations were accomplished
by the Gaussian41 program and GaussView
program was used for visualization of optimized structures and vibrational
modes. A most appropriate structure has been proposed after the coordination
of Ag with AHMT. Three possible structural considerations were optimized
using DFT (Figure 3). Gibbs free energies of all the three structures of the Ag-coordinated
AHMT dimer were obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G**+LanL2DZ level of theory
in the water solvent. The N–Ag–S structure was more
stable than N–Ag–N and S–Ag–S by 1.44
and 4.62 eV, respectively.

Based on these findings the structure of nanocrystalline AHMT-Ag
is proposed (Figure 5). Ag(I) centers are linked with coordination sites of AHMT via sulfur
and nitrogen atoms throughout the arrangement and adjacent layers
are stabilized through π stacking of the aromatic ring and the
intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

Figure 5 Proposed structural network of AHMT-Ag.

In order to investigate stability of the coordination network,
zeta potential of prepared NCCP was measured by using the dynamic
light scattering instrument. The charge on NCCP plays an important
role in accumulation. Larger positive or negative charge repels each
other and prevents accumulation. Zeta potential at −49 mV shows
the extensively stable network of NCCP (S9 Figure S9).

Further, thermo-gravimetric properties of AHMT-Ag are studied under
a nitrogen environment for analysis of the thermal stability and thermal
decomposition activation energy. The thermal decomposition of AHMT
and AHMT-Ag was illustrated by the thermal-gravimetric curve TGA (S10 Figure S10). AHMT-Ag shows a significant weight
loss revealing thermally stable till 222 °C disclosing a thermally
strong network of the coordination polymer. AHMT-Ag displays first
degradation at a lower temperature than AHMT which explores the presence
of the coordination linkage in AHMT-Ag. Here, first decomposition
at 222 °C corresponds to the rupture of the coordination linkage.
The minor degradation detected at 100 °C is due to uncoordinated
water molecules in both AHMT and AHMT-Ag. Further, consecutive degradation
in the TGA plot is due to the thermal breakdown of byproducts and
is the same in both AHMT and AHMT-Ag.42 Activation energy of AHMT-Ag related to thermal degradation is determined
via the Broido equation43 to be 11.39 kJ/mol
(S11 Figure S11).

2.2 Electro Activity of AHMT-Ag
2.2.1 Electrode Active Surface Area
Electroactivity of the
AHMT-Ag NCCP-modified CPE surface is probed by an Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox
system and the unmodified CPE, AHMT-Ag/CPE active surface area are
calculated to be 0.03 and 0.14 cm2. These reveal a substantial
rise in the AHMT-Ag/CPE effective surface area by a factor of 4 caused
by larger exposure and density in the nanoarchitecture modified electrode.
(S12 Figure S12)

2.3 Electrochemical Detection of 6-MP
The remarkably efficient
electroactivity of AHMT-Ag/CPE has been employed to quantify the immunosuppressive
drug 6-MP in various media and for this, the reaction condition was
monitored and optimized.

2.3.1 Optimization of Reaction Conditions
2.3.1.1 Effect of pH
Effect of pH on electrochemical detection
of 6-MP was studied and the results are shown in S13 Figure S13. It shows that as pH increases the anodic potential
displays a negative shift which leads to deprotonation before electron
transfer in the electro-oxidation mechanism and is an obvious behavior
of biological sulphydryl compounds.44,45 The anodic
current increases up to pH 7 and then decreases therefore, pH 7 is
selected as optimum for 6-MP oxidation. The pH of the buffer was optimized
to 7 for the whole quantification spectrum of the drug.

2.3.1.2 Effect of the Scan Rate
The plot of ip (anodic current) versus ν1/2(square
root of the scan rate) displays the diffusion-controlled mechanism
of 6-MP electro-oxidation on AHMT-Ag/CPE and explores adsorption on
the surface of the electroactive electrode (S14 Figure S14b).

2.3.1.3 Number of Electrons Transferred (na)
The electrons involved in the electro-oxidation of 6-MP
(na) is calculated to be 1.64 using the
Laviron equation (S14, Figure S14a,c) and
ensures that irreversible oxidation of 6-MP is a two electron procedure
at AHMT-Ag/CPE, followed by the previous report.46,47

2.3.1.4 Effect of Matrix
Effect of matrix is the collective
effect of several ingredient of the sample other than the analyte
during quantitative analysis. It reduces or increases the analyte
response. Dilution with solvent is the best approach to suppress the
matrix effects. Therefore, mixed blank serum and phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (pH 7.0) were both spiked with 6-MP (60 μM), diluted
with PBS (pH 7.0) at 20, 50, 100, 120, and 150-fold, and analyzed,
respectively, to explore the matrix effect. At 20-fold dilution, the
serum discloses lower anodic peak current and higher anodic peak potential
than PBS (Figure S15A,B). Increasing the
dilution, the peak current remains stable and the anodic peak potential
reduces from 50 to 100-fold in serum. Contrary, the peak current diminishes
sharply while the peak potential rises slightly in PBS. For 100-fold
onward dilution, anodic peak current and potential have almost constant
values. These outcomes demonstrate the 100 times dilution which evidences
the elimination of the matrix effect of serum and guarantees the high
sensitivity and thus adopted for the consequent analysis.

The
electroactivity of AHMT-Ag/CPE was explored for the thorough and broad
spectrum voltammetric assay of 6-MP in PBS at optimized pH 7.0. A
featured anodic signature exhibits at 0.48 V in the voltammogram of
cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetric (DPV)
using AHMT-Ag/CPE is a crucial signature of 6-MP electro-oxidation.
In order to establish the complete experimentation, the plot for the
consecutive addition was observed (Figure 6) which shows anodic peak enhancement with
the successive addition in both CV and DPV. The calibration graph
for DPV, executes linear dependency of anodic current with drug concentration
and provides the limit of detection as 21 nM and sensitivity 0.56
μA/μM with the regression value of 0.99 at the S/N ratio
(signal/noise): 3.

Figure 6 (a) Differential pulse voltammogram recorded on AHMT-Ag/CPE in
0.1 M PBS (pH 7) by successive addition of 6-MP, the inset of (a)
cyclic voltammogram recorded by successive addition of 6-MP, (b) corresponding
calibration plot.

The anodic peak increases significantly with the sequential addition
of drug because the AHMT-Ag modified electrode endorsed the electro-oxidation
of 6-MP. Here 6-MP approaches to the modified electrode and gets attached.
The driving force for the endorsement of attachment and electro-oxidation
is (a) intermolecular hydrogen bonding between amino groups, (b) the
effective electron channeling of AHMT-Ag which assist the faster electron
transfer through the electrode, (c) the π–π electron
coupling of aromatic rings, (d) hydrophobic interaction between duplex
AHMT-Ag and 6-MP, (e) high surface area of AHMT-Ag, and (f) electro-catalytic
efficiency of Ag promote the electro-oxidation of 6-MP. The schematics
for electro-oxidation of 6-MP at the AHMT-Ag platform is presented,
it occurs through transfer of two electrons and two protons and electron
channeling occurs through the AHMT-Ag platform (Scheme 2).

Scheme 1 Possible Mechanism for Formation of AHMT-Ag
Scheme 2 Mechanism for Electro-Oxidation of 6-MP
In order to verify the broad spectrum applicability of the sensor,
AHMT-Ag/CPE was used to assay 6-MP in pharmaceutical formulation of
the drug. The sample solution was developed in buffer and pH was maintained
at 7. This spiked solution of the tablet was utilized for the voltammetric
assay under the same experimental conditions optimized for the ideal
situation using both CV and DPV and shown in Figure 7. The CV and DPV response for the successive
addition of the drug exhibit an anodic peak at 0.48 V with corresponding
to 6-MP oxidation. The corresponding calibration plot for the detection
shows a linear response of anodic current with a concentration of
6-MP up to 120 μM with a limit of detection 37 nM and a regression
value 98% validating the sensing approach in clinical formulation.

Figure 7 (a) Differential pulse voltammogram recorded on AHMT-Ag/CPE in
0.1 M PBS (pH 7) by successive addition of the 6-MP tablet, the inset
of (a) cyclic voltammogram recorded by successive addition of 6-MP,
(b) corresponding calibration plot.

2.4 Validation of Method
Various constituents present in
serum and urine coexist; therefore, the primary objective of this
report was to assess and explore the ability of the sensor to assay
6-MP in urine and serum. The urine and serum samples were diluted
and buffered to pH 7. The developed sensor explores the dependence
of an anodic peak current of 6-MP on concentration. The plot for consecutive
addition is displayed (Figures 8 and 9) which provides a limit of detection
97 and 87 nM , respectively, using DPV results. The sensitivity diminished
in urine and serum which may be because of the matrix effect. In the
light of these results, the developed sensing platform is highly sensitive
and versatile for detection of 6-MP which is authenticated in clinical
formulation, human urine as well as serum samples. The characteristic
envisioned anodic current event is figured at 0.48 V. Further, the
proposed method was compared with various reported methods for 6-MP
detection through a bar diagram (Table S2 and Figure S17). The proposed system
provides the least detection limit among the existing literature for
6-MP assay and thus supports the better efficiency of the designed
sensor.

Figure 8 (a) Differential pulse voltammogram recorded on AHMT-Ag/CPE in
the urine sample by successive addition of 6-MP, the inset of (a)
cyclic voltammogram recorded by successive addition of 6-MP, (b) corresponding
calibration plot.

Figure 9 (a) Differential pulse voltammogram recorded on AHMT-Ag/CPE in
the serum sample by successive addition of 6-MP, the inset of (a)
cyclic voltammogram recorded by successive addition of 6-MP, (b) corresponding
calibration plot.

The serum sample was investigated by the electrochemical assay.
Pearson’s correlation analysis discloses a substantial relationship
of 6-MP concentrations in serum analyzed by the electrochemical method
(r = 0.9131, 0 < p < 1) (Figure 9).

The matrix effect of serum has been studied with direct dilution
and avoided the complex modification process. The sensitivity of the
method was significant covering fairly low and lethal 6-MP concentrations.
This encouraging work is to develop a simple, accurate, and practical
electrochemical method for the determination of 6-MP in plasma for
clinical diagnosis.

2.5 Interference and Repeatability Test
Interference study
was performed to examine the specificity of the electrochemical sensor
by using 6-MP (55 μM) with and without 100 μM solution
of interfering substances through the designed electrochemical technique
(Figure 10). It can
be noticed that the electrochemical current response deviation due
to the interfering agent was <5% of without interferences, representing
excellent selectivity of designed electrochemical sensors. Further, the reproducibility
was confirmed by performing the repeatability test in both interday
(1, 2, 3, and 4 days) and intraday (0, 2, 4, and 6 h). Figure S16a,b shows intra and interday repeatability
test by differential pulse voltammogram at the fixed potential 0.48
V recorded on AHMT-Ag/CPE in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7) by successive addition
of 6-MP.

3 Conclusions
This article provides the development of an elegant nanocrystalline
polymeric network of AHMT-Ag which provides a geometrically and symmetrically
feasible highly sensitive platform for the ultra-trace and whole spectrum
systematic and potential quantification of 6-MP. The effective electron
channeling through the nanocrystalline architecture is essential for
facile production of feature-centered events. The complete experimentation
depicted that serendipitous use of AHMT-Ag is crucial for generating
distinctive current patterns in characteristic events. This feature
endows high confidence assay at an ultratrace level. The key of success
of the sensing methodology is the feasible and faster electron channeling
through the nanocrystalline polymeric platform. The potential of the
study is enzymeless, cost-effective, and complete spectrum ultratrace
detection of 6-MP. This strategy can be explored in the commercial
portable device fabrication for a variety of anticancer drugs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Materials
AHMT was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
USA. Silver salt (AgNO3), 6-MP monohydrate (6-MP), TEMPO,
sodium hydroxide, and BHT were bought from SRL chemical (India) and
used as accepted unless mentioned otherwise. Aqua regia was used for
cleaning of the glassware, after rinsing with the mixture of ultrapure
water and ethanol, Merck India. 6-MP solution was freshly equipped
by using doubly deionized water and ethanol mixture solution (1:1).
The electrodes used to prepare the carbon-paste electrode were procured
from bio-analytical organization. Human urine and blood serum samples
were obtained from authorized hospitals. The tablet of 6-MP was acquired
through a local supplier (Cipla Ltd. India); reaction solutions were
exposed in pure nitrogen to remove oxygen and avoid any external oxidation
during each electrochemical measurement.

4.2 Electrode Fabrication

then the cavity of the electrode was filled with a portion of the
resulting paste. The surface of the CPE was smoothed against butter
paper and rinsed with distilled water. The carbon paste was cautiously
removed prior to pressing a new fraction into the electrode after
each measurement.

4.3 Instrumentation

(X-ray photoelectron spectrometry) was executed with, Shimadzu Group
Company, Kratos analytical instrument, XPS (UK), with 1.254 Å
Mg Kα radiations. Nova, Nano-SEM 450 FEI (Netherlands) was used
for the recording HR-SEM. An FEI TECHNAI G2 20 TWIN Czech
Republic electron microscope was used for recording HR-TEM, EDS mapping,
and EDX with 200 keV (accelerating voltage) on a copper grid (carbon-coated)
prepared by 6 μL of polymer solution. A Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC
1 STARE System, Switzerland was used for thermal analysis. TGA and
DTA were performed in an inert atmosphere with a heating rate of 10
°C min–1. All electrochemical measurements
were accomplished on a Ω Metrohm, 797 VA, Computrace trace analyzer,
Switzerland, using a three electrode assembly by electrochemical software
3.1 with AHMT-Ag-modified CPE (working electrode), Pt foil (counter
electrode), Ag/AgCl (reference electrode), and pH 7.0 phosphate buffer
used as supporting electrolytes for all electrochemical measurements.

4.4 Experimental Procedure for AHMT-Ag Synthesis
13.5 mM
aqueous/ethanolic solution of AHMT and 100 mM ethanolic solution of
AgNO3 were prepared. Further, the AgNO3 solution
was dropwise added in the AHMT solution with continuous stirring for
24 h at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. A blackish-grey
precipitate of AHMT-Ag NCCP was obtained then the obtained precipitate
was washed three times after filtration followed by water–ethanol
mixture solution (1:1 v/v %) to remove the unreacted AHMT and AgNO3. Removal of the solvent was regulated at 40 °C in vacuum
and the obtained yield was 87%. (S1 Figure S1)

4.5 Radical Controlled Experiments
The radical-controlled
experiments with BHT (2,6-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene)
and TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyl oxidanyl) trapping agents,
endows the cationic pathway without any interference under standard
conditions (Figure 11). Mechanism involves silver ions as a cationic companion for initiating
polymerization and launching the silver-associated monomeric segment
which activates Ag oxidation to furnish AHMT-Ag.47 (Scheme 1). Thereafter structural and bonding information is reviewed under
FT-IR, 1H NMR, and XPS analysis.

Figure 11 Schematic illustration of controlled experiments for the formation
of AHMT-Ag using TEMPO and BHT.
