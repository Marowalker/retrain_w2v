A series of thiophene derivatives
were synthesized by functionalization
of 2,3-fused thiophene scaffolds. Their cytotoxicity was assessed
against HeLa and Hep G2 cells. Compound 480 was identified as a promising
candidate because of its low IC50 in HeLa (12.61 μg/mL)
and Hep G2 (33.42 μg/mL) cells. The drug was loaded into folic
acid (FA)-coated nanoparticles (NPs) to address its poor water solubility
and to improve its selectivity for cancer cells. Compound 480 was
shown to induce apoptosis by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential
(ΔΨm) and the reactive oxygen species level.
Furthermore, FA-modified NPs enhanced uptake capacity compared to
unmodified controls by flow cytometry. This drug delivered in folate
nanocarriers is promising for the treatment of cancers.

1 Introduction
Cancer is a leading cause
of death in the world. Most antitumor
drugs have serious side effects, which limited their application.1−3 For example, paclitaxel is widely used in the treatment of cancer.
However, its hypersensitivity reactions, hematological toxicity, neurotoxicity,
and muscular toxicity limited its application.4 The emergence of new drugs is expected to alleviate this problem.
Thiophene constitutes a five-membered heterocyclic scaffold and has
attracted much attention because of their presence in some marketed
drugs,5,6 including NSAID, antiasthma, diuretic, antihistaminic,
and anticancer drugs.7,8 We have synthesized a series of
thiophene derivatives.5 However, poor water
solubility and severe effects have restricted their application. In
fact, because of thiophene-associated hepatotoxicity, many thiophene-containing
drugs have been removed from the drug market. A targeted drug delivery
system may be able to address these issues.

Nanocarriers offer
major advantages containing the ability to avoid
multidrug resistance9 and the enhanced
permeability and retention effect in cancer therapeutics.10,11 Nanoparticles (NPs) can also achieve sustained release of drugs
and targeting effect to cancer cells by attaching targeting molecules
that bind to specific receptors on the cancer cell surface,12 such as arginine–glycine–aspartic
acid, transferrin, and vitamin folate (FA).13,14

FA has high affinity with folate receptors (FRs), which are
overexpressed
in many cancer cells including breast, colorectal, ovarian, brain,
and lung cancer,14,15 while their expression in normal
cells is low.16−18 The difference can be exploited to realize the targeting
of cancer cells.

Herein, thiophene derivatives were evaluated
and screened for cytotoxicity,
and a drug candidate compound 480 was loaded into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanocarriers coated with FA to
achieve targeting to cancer cells.19

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Cytotoxicity of Thiophene
Derivatives
A series of thiophene derivatives were synthesized,
as shown in Figure 1, and analyzed for
cytotoxicity. As shown in Figure 2A, paclitaxel was used as a control, and compounds
471 and 480 had high cytotoxicity with IC50 of 23.79 and
33.42 μg/mL, respectively, against HeLa cells. For Hep G2 cells,
the IC50 values were 13.34 and 12.61 μg/mL. Moreover,
as depicted in Figure 2B, they were all cytotoxic against normal cells (HEK-293T) at a concentration
of 20 μg/mL, which suggested that they had no ability to specifically
recognize cancer cells. In addition, we measured their solubility
in water and concluded that the solubility of compound 480 is 25 μg/mL,
whereas compound 471 is insoluble in water. Therefore, compound 480
was chosen for further evaluation.

thiophene derivatives against HeLa and Hep G2 cell lines. (B) Cytotoxicity

mean ± SD (n = 6).

2.2 Characterization of NPs-480
Compound
480 had high cytotoxicity but had poor water solubility (20 μg/mL)
and lacked tumor cell selectivity. To address these issues, we designed
and prepared targeted NPs loaded with compound 480 by a single-emulsion
method and decorated FA as a targeting ligand. The NPs were prepared
by an oil-in-water emulsion method for its high solubility of 15 mg/mL
in dichloromethane. Characteristics of the NPs including particle
size, polydispersity index (PDI), drug loading (DL), and entrapment
efficiency (EE) are shown in Table 1. The diameter of folate modified PLGA nanoparticles
(FPNPs) was 172.4 ± 2.052 nm, with a PDI of 0.144 ± 0.036,
similar to PLGA nanoparticles (PNPs) (163.9 ± 7.067 nm), which
indicates narrow particle size distribution. As shown in Figure 3, the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image revealed that FPNPs-480 were monodisperse spheres
with smooth shapes. The mean diameter was smaller than that determined
by dynamic light scattering (DLS).

a Data represent
the mean ± SD
(n = 3).

We used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to measure
the DL and calculated the EE. The loading efficiencies of compound
480 in FPNPs-480 and PNPs-480 were 94.64 and 96.73% w/w, respectively.

2.3 Colloidal Stability of NPs
NPs incubated
in different media were evaluated for their stability by size and
PDI analyses. As shown in Figure 4A,B, particle size and PDI at 4 °C did not change
much within a week in deionized water and phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) (pH 7.4) but increased after the fifth day in PBS with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). Figure 4C,D shows the stability of NPs incubated
at 37 °C, which suggested that NPs were stable in deionized water
and began to aggregate slightly from day 6 in PBS, which indicated
that the NPs were relatively stable. In addition, there was a rapid
increase from day 4 in PBS with 10% FBS, but this would not affect
the results in vivo and in vitro cell experiments because of their
rapid distribution after intravenous injection.

of FPNPs-480. FPNPs-480 stored in three
various media at 4 °C (A,B) and 37 °C (C,D). Values are
mean ± SD (n = 3).

2.4 In Vitro Release
The in vitro release
profiles of PNPs-480 and FPNPs-480 incubated in PBS with 40% ethanol
for 2 days are shown in Figure 5. The release profiles of PNPs and FPNPs were similar, with
a cumulative release of 80 and 86% after 48 h, respectively. The release
rate of FPNPs was similar to PNPs, and they all showed a sustained
release pattern.

method.
PNPs-480 and FPNPs-480 were incubated in PBS containing 40% (v/v)
ethanol at 37 °C. Values are mean ± SD (n = 3).

2.5 Cytotoxicity
Assays
The cytotoxic
effects of blank FPNPs, free drugs, PNPs-480, and FPNPs-480 were measured
by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay. As depicted in Figure 6A, blank FPNPs had no significant cytotoxic effect
on cells. Free drugs acted fast, and they showed stronger cytotoxicity
than PNPs-480 and FPNPs-480. This could be due to the attenuated release
of the drug from the NPs. Both PNPs-480 and FPNPs-480 displayed time-dependent
cytotoxicity in 72 h. In Figure 6B, a significant difference in cell viability was found
between the FPNPs-480-treated group and the PNPs-480-treated group
at 24 h (P < 0.05) and 48 h (P < 0.01) against HeLa cells, respectively. A difference in cell
viability was found in Hep G2 cells at 48 h (P <
0.05) as exhibited in Figure 6C. In short, FPNPs-480 exhibited higher cytotoxicity than
PNPs-480, which was likely due to the FR targeting. The cytotoxicity
of NPs in normal cells (HEK-293T) is given in Figure 6D. No significant difference in cytotoxicity
was observed between the FPNPs-480- and the PNPs-480-treated groups.
This indicated that the FA-mediated pathway enhanced the uptake of
cancer cells with a high level of FRs.

HeLa, Hep G2, and HEK-293T cells were treated
with blank FPNPs (A). HeLa cells (B), Hep G2 cells (C), and HEK-293T
cells (D) were treated with free drugs, PNPS-480, and FPNPs-480 with
different exposure times. Data represent the mean ± standard
deviation (n = 3).

2.6 Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay
Apoptosis induction by compound 480 was assessed through ΔΨm using the 5,50,6,60-tetrachloro-1,10,3,30-tetraethyl-imidacarbocyanine
iodide (JC-1) fluorescent probe in HeLa and Hep G2 cells. As shown
in Figure 7, the green
fluorescence intensity of the three groups increased to varying degrees,
indicating the apoptosis induction by compound 480. Interestingly,
FPNPs-480-treated cells showed much lower red–green fluorescence
ratio than the cells treated with PNPs-480 because of FR targeting.

of ΔΨm. Cells were treated with free
drugs, PNPs-480, and FPNPs-480, and ΔΨm were
reflected by the intensity of red and green fluorescence. Photograph
shows the merged image of JC-1 red and green.

2.7 Assessment of the Generation Level of ROS
Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was measured
using the fluorescent dye 2′-7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA). ROS is involved in cell growth, proliferation,
and apoptosis. Elevated high levels of ROS can make mitochondrial
dysfunction promote cell apoptosis. The ROS in the cell can oxidize
nonfluorescent DCFH to green fluorescent DCF. The fluorescence intensity
is proportional to the level of ROS.

The levels of ROS produced
by the two cancer cells treated with compound 480, PNPs-480, and FPNPs-480
are presented in Figure 8. All of them were capable of making cells apoptotic. Among them,
FPNPs-480 had the highest green fluorescence intensity compared with
PNPs-480, which was likely due to their FR-targeting capability.

of free drugs, PNPs, and FPNPs reflected by the intensity of green
fluorescence image.

2.8 In Vitro
Cellular Uptake
To investigate
the role of FR in the uptake of NPs against HeLa cells, PNPs and FPNPs
were labeled with rhodamine B.

As shown in Figure 9, HeLa cells had higher red
fluorescence intensity in the group treated with rhodamine B-labeled
FPNP group than that treated with the PNP group. These results indicated
that FA-modified NPs can enhance cellular uptake.

Figure 9 Intracellular uptake
of NPs. Confocal images show intracellular
uptake of rhodamine B-labeled PNPs and FPNPs against HeLa cells.

Flow cytometry was performed for
measuring the uptake of rhodamine-labeled
PNPs and FPNPs under the same culture condition. The results are shown
in Figure 10. PNP-
and FPNP-treated groups had very significant differences compared
with control. The fluorescence intensity of cells with high FPNP uptake
was 1.43 times than that of cells treated with the PNP group (p < 0.01). This indicated that FR targeting mediated
more efficient uptake in vitro, which was consistent with confocal
results.

NPs. Values are mean ± SD (n = 3, ***P < 0.001 vs control, ##p < 0.01 vs PNPs).

3 Conclusions
In this study, we synthesized
a series of thiophene derivatives.
The antitumor activity of these compounds was then evaluated by the
cytotoxicity assay. Compound 480 was identified as a promising anticancer
agent for having higher antitumor activity with low IC50 in HeLa (12.61 μg/mL) and HepG2 (33.42 μg/mL), which
was much lower than paclitaxel (Figure 2) under the same experimental conditions. In this study,
FR-targeting NPs were then used to address their poor water solubility
and nonspecificity. The nanocarriers showed a desirable mean diameter
with narrow size distribution, high encapsulation efficiency, and
excellent serum stability. Compound 480 can induce a change in ΔΨm and ROS generation. Our results verified that FA-modified
NPs had enhanced uptake capacity compared to unmodified controls.
In short, FPNPs-480 showed an excellent therapeutic effect on cancer.
It improved the solubility of drugs and promoted tumor uptake through
the FR. Its mechanism of action and its application in cancer therapy
warrant further investigation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
PLGA 5050 1.5A was supplied
by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma (Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany). NH2–PEG–NH2 [molecular weight (MW) 5000
Da] was obtained from Yare Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). FA and
MTT were obtained from Yuanye Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). Polyvinyl
alcohol (87–89% hydrolyzed, MW 13 000–23 000
Da) and JC-1 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA).
DCFH-DA, a fluorescent dye, was obtained from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering
Institute (Nanjing, China). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
was obtained from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology (Haimen, China).
Rhodamine B was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (Shanghai,
China). HeLa, Hep G2, and HEK-293T cell lines were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Acetonitrile was purchased
from Thermo Fisher Scientific.

4.2 Cell
Culture
HeLa, Hep G2, and HEK-293T
cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) containing 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL
streptomycin under humidified conditions at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

4.3 MTT Assay
Three cell lines: HeLa,
Hep G2, and HEK-293T, were used to evaluate cytotoxicity. Briefly,
these compounds (Figure 1) were dissolved in 5% ethanol and then diluted to different concentrations
in DMEM. Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate for 24 h. Then, the
medium was replaced with a medium containing various concentrations
of compounds for additional 24 h. Subsequently, after a 4 h incubation
because MTT was added, the medium was discarded and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) was added. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm by a microplate
reader. Paclitaxel and basic medium containing 5% ethanol were used
as positive and negative controls, respectively.

4.4 Preparation of NPs
FA-PEG-PLGA was
synthesized as described previously.20,21 FPNPS-480
was prepared as follows: PLGA (28.5 mg), PLGA-PEG-FA (9.5 mg), and
compound 480 (1.22 mg, 3.0 wt %) were dissolved in 4 mL of chloroform/acetone
(1:1 v/v). The solution was injected into 8 mL of 1% (w/v) poly(vinyl
alcohol) under sonication in an ice bath over 30 s at 200 W with 15
pulses of 1 s duration and sonicated for additional 2 min. The resulting
emulsion was then dispersed in 15 mL of deionized water and evaporated
for 4 h at room temperature to remove organic solvent. PNPS-480 was
prepared using the same procedure except for replacement of PLGA-PEG-FA
with PLGA. In addition, rhodamine B-loaded NPs were prepared for uptake
experiments in order to facilitate detection. The obtained NPs were
pelleted by centrifugation (20 000 rpm, 15 min), washed three
times, resuspended in 1 mL of deionized water, lyophilized, and stored
at 4 °C.

4.5 Characterization of NPs
Particle
size and PDI of NPs were measured using DLS (Zetasizer Nano ZS90,
Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). Morphological characteristics of
NPs were observed by SEM (JXA-840, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Drops of NPs
were added to the surface of the silicon wafer and dried for further
observation by SEM.

The loading capacity and EE were determined
using an HPLC (Waters Corp, Milford, MA, USA) system equipped with
an Agilent XDB-C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm) at 300
nm. Briefly, NPs were destroyed by acetonitrile on vortex for releasing
the compound, and then the mobile phase (60% of acetonitrile) was
added to extract the compound. Then compound 480 was analyzed by HPLC.
DL and EE were calculated according to the following formula    

4.6 Colloidal Stability of NPs
NPs suspended
in deionized water, PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4), and PBS with 10% FBS at 37
and 4 °C, respectively, were analyzed by DLS at predetermined
time points to evaluate their sizes and PDI.

4.7 In Vitro
Release
Dialysis method
was used to measure in vitro release kinetics for PNPs-480 and FPNPs-480.22 Dispersions of PNPs-480 and FPNPs-480 corresponding
to 1 mg of compound 480 were loaded into dialysis bags (MWCO 7 kD),
immersed in 50 mL PBS-40% ethanol, and incubated in a water shaker
at 37 °C and 100 rpm.23 At fixed time
points, 5 mL of samples were withdrawn and replaced with equal amounts
of fresh dialysis medium. The cumulative percentage of drug release
was determined using HPLC.

4.8 Cytotoxicity Assays
The cytotoxic
effect of compound 480, PNPs-480, and FPNPs-480 against HeLa, Hep
G2, and HEK-293T cells was evaluated by the MTT method, respectively.
Cells were plated at a density of 6000 cells/well in 96-well plates
and incubated for 24 h. Then, the medium was replaced with fresh medium
containing free drugs, PNPs, and FPNPs. At predetermined time points,
MTT was added. After incubating for 4 h, absorbance was measured on
a microplate reader.

4.9 Mitochondrial Membrane
Potential (ΔΨm) Assessment
ΔΨm was used
to determine cellular apoptosis because the loss of ΔΨm is an early event in the apoptotic process. JC-1 is a fluorescence
probe widely applied to detect ΔΨm. At high
ΔΨm, JC-1 accumulates in the mitochondrial
matrix and forms a polymer that produces red fluorescence. At low
ΔΨm, JC-1 exists as a monomer and produces
green fluorescence. The difference in the ratio between green and
red fluorescence was viewed by a fluorescence inverted microscope.

The cells were cultured for 24 h. Then, the medium was displaced
with a new medium including compound 480, PNPs-480, or FPNPs-480.
After 12 h, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with the
JC-1 dye in PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4) for 10 min in the dark and then inspected
with a fluorescent inverted microscope.

4.10 Evaluation
of the ROS Level
Cells
were plated in six-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 per well, incubated for 24 h, and then treated with fresh medium
containing free drugs, PNPs-480, or FPNPs-480 for 12 h. Then, the
cells were incubated with 10 μM DCFH-DA in PBS (pH 7.4) for
10 min in darkness. Subsequently, the cells were washed and imaged
with an inverted microscope.

4.11 In Vitro
Cellular Uptake Studies
Uptake of PNPs and FPNPs by HeLa
cells was evaluated. Cells were
incubated for 24 h and treated with rhodamine B-loaded NPs for 4 h.
Then, cells were washed with PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4) and fixed in 4%
formaldehyde. After 10 min, nuclei were stained with DAPI according
to protocols from the supplier. Uptake of cells was visualized by
a confocal mcroscope (LSM710, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

HeLa
Cells were cultured for 24 h. The medium was discarded and changed
into medium including rhodamine-labeled NPs. After incubation for
4 h, the cells were washed three times with PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4),
released with 100 μL trypsin, and then analyzed by an EPICS
XL flow cytometer from Beckman Coulter (Brea, CA, USA). Ten thousand
cells were analyzed in triplicates for each group.

4.12 Statistical Analysis
Data are shown
as mean ± SD. Results were analyzed using Student’s t-test. P values < 0.05 were regarded
as statistically significant. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
