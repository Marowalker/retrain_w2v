It is greatly significant to develop
a simple and rapid sensing
method for triclosan (TCS) because it is a widely used and a chronically
toxic compound that adversely affects biological organisms and human
health. This paper presents the design and development of a novel
simple optosensor that uses carboxylic group-functionalized NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ upconversion nanoparticles
(UCNPs) coated with potassium permanganate (KMnO4). The
sensor enables the rapid, non-autofluorescence, sensitive, and selective
detection of TCS based on the “turn off–on fluorescence”
technique through fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Under an
near-infrared radiation excitation (980 nm), the “turn-off
fluorescence” process involves the transfer of fluorescence
resonance energy between the UCNPs and KMnO4, whereas the
“turn-on fluorescence” process occurs when KMnO4 is reduced in the presence of TCS. TCS was detected by recovering
the green emission of UCNPs. Under optimized conditions, the resulting
sensor offered an excellent response to TCS with 0.2 μM of a
limit of detection. The developed sensor showed higher selectivity
to TCS than other phenolic compounds. Moreover, the analytical performance
of the proposed probe was practically demonstrated to successfully
monitor trace levels of TCS in samples of tap water and personal care
products. The developed simple and sensitive method may offer a new
approach for determining TCS in environmental applications.

1 Introduction
Triclosan (TCS) is widely
used as an antimicrobial and preservative
agent in household cleaners, toothpaste, soap, and plastics with a
concentration ranging from 0.1 to 0.3% of product weight.1,2 It is found in ubiquitous environments including wastewater, drinking
water, soils, and living organisms.3 However,
once TCS has been released into the environment, it is considered
as a toxic pollutant capable of disrupting endocrine compounds because
its structure is similar to that of thyroid hormones. Moreover, TCS
can kill normal bacteria by blocking the biosynthesis of lipids and
causes mutated bacteria that become resistant to TCS and are more
likely to survive and be reproduced.4,5 The growing
awareness of the toxicity of TCS has led to an increasing demand for
the development of highly sensitive analytical methods. In recent
years, several analytical methods for the determination of TCS have
been developed, among which are those based on chromatography,6−8 electrochemistry,9,10 spectroscopy,11−13 immunoassay,14 and decomposition by an enzyme or radicals.15−17 However, these methods need expensive instrumentation and complicated
procedures and require highly skilled personnel. In particular, methods
that use fluorescent techniques for the determination of TCS have
not yet been reported. Therefore, the development of a TCS optosensor
with high sensitivity and selectivity remains a challenge that has
not yet been addressed.

Potassium permanganate (Mn(VII); KMnO4) is a strong
oxidative agent that reacts with electron-rich moieties such as phenols,
anilines, and olefins. Compared with other oxidants such as ozone,
chlorine, and ferrate, KMnO4 has several advantages such
as its relatively low cost, ease of handling, effectiveness across
a wide pH range, and comparative stability.18 In addition, the oxidation processes of antibiotics, phenolic endocrine
disrupting chemicals, and organic pollutants have been demonstrated
based on the reaction with Mn(VII) as an oxidant.19,20 The reactions of Mn(VII) with certain organic compounds commonly
lead to the formation of a series of intermediates such as Mn(IV)
or Mn(III) depending on the nature of the ligands. Stable Mn(III)
has been found to be produced by the oxidation of organic substances
in the presence of certain ligands, such as phosphate, pyrophosphate,
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, and humic acid. In addition, Mn(IV)
can be aggregated by an oxidative process to form brown colloids.
This is stabilized by preventing the disproportionate oxidation of
KMnO4 and the formation of intermediates is accelerated
by the oxidation of TCS by Mn(IV).20−22 Furthermore, Mn(VII)
readily oxidizes TCS via several reactions including hydrogen abstraction,
electron exchange, and direct oxygen transfer, thereby decreasing
the adverse activity of TCS.23 Jiang’s
group found that, during the Mn(VII)/TCS reaction, the absorption
band of inherent Mn(VII) disappears from the range 490–590
nm.24 As a result, we expect KMnO4 to be an excellent candidate for the detection of TCS by fluorescent
materials that emit light in the blue and green bands of the visible
spectrum.

Compared with other fluorescent materials such as
organic fluorescent
dyes and quantum dots, upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) that emit
visible light following an excitation with near-infrared radiation
(NIR) have been widely used in biological and chemical applications.
In particular, the use of NIR irradiation has attractive properties,
including sharp emission, low toxicity, non-autofluorescence, absence
of photodamage, and deep tissue permeability.25,26 NaYF4, which has low phonon energy, is often used as
the host material of the upconversion material with doping Yb3+ and Er3+. The Yb3+, Er3+ ions are the sensitizer and the activator, respectively. Under NIR
excitation (980 nm wavelength), the fluorescent upconversion process
appears when there are transfers of excited energy from Yb3+ ions to Er3+ ions. The relax process of Er3+ ions gives radiative transitions at the green band. The observed
upconversion luminescence (UCL) spectra only originate from NaYF4:Yb,Er.27−29 Therefore, one of the advantages of the fluorescent
upconversion process is non-autofluorescence from the matrix of the
sample when the sample is excited by NIR wavelength.

However,
UCNPs synthesized via general methods have low solubility
and lack the functional groups required to react with analytes. Therefore,
it is necessary to modify the surface of UCNPs to enable them to selectively
detect the target materials.30−32 Many researchers have developed
UCNPs based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process
for sensing specific biomolecules. For example, UCNPs coated with
manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheets were designed for the
detection of glutathione (GSH) and glucose (Glu) by using UCNPs as
the donor and MnO2 as the acceptor, which were released
from UCNPs’ surface in the presence of GSH and Glu.33,34 UCNPs coated with MnO2 indicated that the analytes could
be effectively determined by controlling the fluorescence emission
band. However, in their study, they used a core–shell structure,
which was synthesized in an organic solvent, and either the surface
of the UCNPs had to be modified such that they became hydrophilic
nanoparticles or glucose oxidase was used (for sensing Glu).

In this work, we report for the first time a simple approach for
the rapid and highly selective detection of TCS by using poly(acrylic
acid) (PAA)-functionalized NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ UCNPs coated with KMnO4. The method was based
on the FRET process that occurs in the green emission band, which
was originated from the radiative transitions of Er3+ ions
through the energy transfer process from Yb3+ ions. The
UCNPs were synthesized via a one-step solvothermal method at 200 °C
for 12 h. The PAA-functionalized NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ UCNPs are high soluble in aqueous solution and react with
added KMnO4 by electrostatic interactions. The emission
of green light (500–570 nm) by NIR-excited UNCPs donor is inhibited
by KMnO4 (FRET acceptor) via the FRET process. Upon TCS
addition, KMnO4 oxidizes TCS by attacking its hydroxyl
group, thereby forming MnO2, which does not absorb 500–570
nm. Thus, FRET is disrupted, and UCNPs emit green light, as shown
in Scheme 1.

Mechanism of “Turn Off–On” for Detection
of TCS
2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of PAA-Functionalized
NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ UCNPs
The
obtained
UCNPs were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and the results are
shown in Figure 1.
The FE-SEM images show that the prepared UCNPs have uniform shapes
and a particle size of 100 nm (Figure 1a). The XRD pattern of the sample corresponds with
the referenced peak position and intensity of hexagonal NaYF4 (JCPDS PDF 28-1192), confirming the formation of well-crystallized
UCNPs (Figure 1b).
Moreover, the EDS analysis revealed the composition of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ and PAA (Figure 1c).

Figure 1 Characterization of PAA-functionalized NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ UCNPs; (a) FE-SEM image,
(b) XRD pattern,
(c) EDS analysis, (d) FT-IR spectra.

The functional groups on the surface of the obtained UCNP
samples
were identified by recording FT-IR spectra. As shown in Figure 1d (black line), a broad absorption
band at 3400 cm–1 relates with O–H stretching
vibrations. The peaks at 1720 and 1392 cm–1 confirm
the existence of the COOH group and the carboxylate anion, respectively.
Other peaks are consistent with C=C stretching at approximately
1400–1550 cm–1. The COOH group on the surface
of the UCNPs ensures good solubility and reacts with KMnO4. The peak at 528 cm–1, which is the Mn–O
stretching vibration, confirms the existence of this bond on the UCNPs.

2.2 Fluorescent Property of UCNPs@KMnO4
The UV–vis and UCL spectra of UCNPs@KMnO4 show
that the absorption band of KMnO4 and the emission
of UCNPs overlap in the region of 500–550 nm (Figure 2a). This overlap can lead to
FRET from the UCNPs (as donor) to the KMnO4 (as acceptor)
in the green emission band to decrease the UCL intensity of the UCNPs.
The effect of the KMnO4 concentration on the absorbance
and UCL intensity of UCNPs was assessed. We found that the absorption
band appeared in the range of 400–450 nm when the concentration
of KMnO4 exceeded 0.825 mM (Figure 2b). This band can be related to MnO2 because KMnO4 exists as MnO2 under neutral
or slightly alkaline conditions.23 As shown
in Figure 2c, the green
emission of UCNPs decreased with increasing KMnO4 concentration
and was completely quenched when the concentration of KMnO4 reached 1.65 mM. On the basis of this result, the value of 1.65
mM KMnO4 was selected for subsequent experiments.

Figure 2 (a) Absorption
spectrum of KMnO4 (blue line) and emission
of the prepared UCNPs (black line), (b) absorption spectra at various
concentrations of KMnO4, and (c) effect of KMnO4 concentration on UCL spectra after a reaction time of 2 h.

The time dependence of the reaction
between UCNP@KMnO4 and TCS was studied. Figure 3a shows the absorption spectra
of a mixture of UCNP@KMnO4 and TCS after different reaction
times. We found that the
change of absorbance in the range of 500–550 nm was negligible
with increasing the reaction time, whereas the nonspecific absorbance
at a short range <500 nm corresponding to colloidal manganese oxides
Mn(IV) gradually increased with increasing reaction time. The brown
colloid Mn(IV), which was formed as the intermediate when Mn(VII)
oxidizes TCS, can be observed by the naked eye. Although Mn(VII) is
generally converted to the Mn(III) state when TCS is oxidized in the
presence of a ligand, in the case of PBS, Mn(IV) rather than Mn(III)
is formed.20−22 Therefore, a certain amount of MnO2 was
formed and increased in the presence of TCS in the UCNPs@KMnO4 solution. The UCL intensity of UCNPs was quenched by coating
KMnO4 because of the overlap between the absorption spectrum
of KMnO4 and emission spectrum of UCNPs. By adding TCS,
the UCL intensity was recovered. The UCL spectra of UCNPs@KMnO4 before and after adding TCS are shown in Figure 3b.

time on absorption spectra of UCNPs@KMnO4 in the presence
of TCS. (b) UCL spectra of UCNPs@KMnO4 before (black line)
and after addition of TCS (red line).

2.3 Detection on TCS-Possible Mechanisms
In this study, UCNPs@ KMnO4 nanoparticles were used to
detect TCS based on the “turn off–on fluorescence intensity”
process. TCS oxidation by KMnO4 mainly involves two pathways,
which are cleavage of the ether bond of TCS by free chlorine ferrate,
O3, MnO2, and a benzene ring-opening reaction.23 On the basis of this information, we predicted
cleavage of the ether bond because of the formation of MnO2 during the reaction of UCNPs@KMnO4, but the −OH
stretching band on the FT-IR spectra (Figure 1d, red line) largely disappears after TCS
is added. More significantly, the Mn–O stretching vibration
at 528 cm–1 increased compared to UCNPs@KMnO4. These results indicate that the hydroxyl group of TCS is
attacked by KMnO4, after which the benzene ring-opening
reaction occurs. After the addition of TCS, KMnO4 separated
from the surface of the UCNPs. This is a result of the oxidation of
TCS by KMnO4. As a result, the UCNPs’ surface was
exposed and released emission in the green band, as shown in Figure 3b. The addition of
TCS to the UCNPs@KMnO4 solution strongly enhanced the green
emission band of UCNPs@ KMnO4 approximately 36 times upon
exposure to 980 nm excitation.

On the basis of the abovementioned
mechanisms, the TCS analytical performance of the proposed optosensor
was investigated by measuring the recovery of the UCL intensity. When
TCS was directly added to UCNPs that have not been coated with KMnO4, the UCL intensity remains unchanged, as shown in Figure 4a. However, the UCL
intensity of UCNPs@KMnO4 gradually increased with the addition
of different TCS concentrations. The dependence of the UCL intensity
of UCNPs@KMnO4 on the TCS concentration is presented in Figure 4b.

Figure 4 (a) Evaluation of UCL
for UCNPs uncoated with KMnO4 upon
addition of TCS, (b) UCL variation of UCNPs@KMnO4 at 542
nm following the addition TCS at different concentrations, (c) relationship
between intensity ratio of F0/F at 542 nm and concentration of TCS. Inset: calibration
curve by plotting the UCL ratio and concentration of TCS (2, 4, 6,
8, 10 μM), (d) UCL ratio (F/F0) of UCNPs@KMnO4 after addition of various
compounds at 10 μM after 60 min of incubation. F0 and F were UCL intensity at 542 nm
in the absence and presence of the compounds.

The relationship between the UCL intensity and TCS concentration
was estimated, as shown in Figure 4c. A calibration curve was established based on the
relationship between the TCS concentration and UCL intensity F0/F ratios (F0 and F are the UCL intensities at 542
nm in the absence and presence of TCS, respectively), as displayed
in Figure 4c. The results
show that there are two linear ranges: the first one is in the range
of 2–10 μM and the second one is in the range of 10–200
μM. The regression equation in the range of 2–10 μM
is F0/F = −0.03364[TCS]
+ 0.43441, where [TCS] is the concentration of TCS (μM) and
the correlation coefficient is 0.9807. The detection limit (LOD) of
the proposed sensor for TCS was calculated to be 0.2 μM according
to the 3.3 × SD/S equation (SD is standard deviation
of the signal and S is the slope of the calibration
curve). The performance of the proposed method was additionally examined
by comparing the results with those obtained by other methods, as
shown in Table 1. Although
the LOD value of the proposed method is comparable to those of electrochemical
methods, the proposed optical method does not require sophisticated
equipment and highly skilled personnel. Moreover, by using diluted
acetone for dissolving TCS, the proposed method can be used to detect
a high TCS concentration (to 200 μM).

The selectivity of the UCNPs@KMnO4 optosensor was evaluated.
The UCL response of UCNPs@KMnO4 was assessed with compounds
related to TCS, including bisphenol A (BPA), 4-chlorophenol (CP),
2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), and pentachlorophenol (PCP) after reacting
for 1 h at a concentration of 10 μM (Figure 4d). Compared to the other species, the UCL
intensity was strongly recovered in the presence of TCS, showing the
loss of the hydroxyl group as a consequence of the oxidation of TCS.
However, all the other compounds except for PCP also have a hydroxyl
group. Considering the second-order rate constants of the reaction
of each of these compounds with KMnO4 under neutral conditions,
it is clear that the reaction of KMnO4 with TCS is much
faster than with the other compounds.18 Moreover, among the substituted phenols, the oxidative reactivity
of TCS with manganese oxide (Mn(IV)) is comparable or higher.43 These results show the high sensitivity and
selectivity toward TCS based on the UCNPs@KMnO4 fluorescence
properties.

2.4 Determination of TCS in
Real Samples
To evaluate the applicability of the fluorescence
sensing system,
UCNPs@KMnO4 was employed for the determination of TCS by
analyzing tap water samples and commercially available personal care
products. The tap water hand-wash samples were spiked with different
amounts of TCS and the samples were analyzed to determine the TCS
concentration. The results are summarized in Table 2. The recovery of TCS in tap water is 92
and 106.7, and 97 and 98% for hand-wash products with RSD < 4%,
respectively. These values indicate that the proposed optosensor is
satisfactory and suitable for the detection of TCS in practical applications.

Table 2 Recovery Study in Real Samples
samples	spike (μM)	found
(μM)	recovery (%)	RSD (n = 3, %)	
tap water	3	3.2	106.7	3.68	
 	5	4.6	92	3.96	
hand wash	3	2.9	97	3.97	
 	5	4.9	98	1.79	
The applicability of the proposed method was further assessed by
determining the TCS in commercial toothpaste samples by the standard
addition method. The results indicated that TCS levels of four different
brands of toothpaste [2 g of toothpaste diluted into 1 L of distilled
water (DW)] are 3.44, 9.32, 9.99, and 7.52 μM, which are comparable
or similar to TCS levels compared with those with other methods.35,36 These results confirmed that this probe demonstrates good sensitivity
and accuracy to monitor TCS in real samples.

3 Conclusions
In summary, this paper presents the first demonstration
that TCS
can be detected based on the “turn off–on” fluorescence
of UCNPs@KMnO4. A possible mechanism for the determination
of TCS is that the UCL intensity of UCNPs@KMnO4 is quenched
in the green band by an energy transfer process between UCNPs and
KMnO4, and then recovered again in the presence of TCS.
The novel TCS sensor possesses high sensitivity and selectivity. This
study confirmed that UCNPs@KMnO4 is a useful probe for
determining TCS and that the method is broadly applicable to the environmental
field.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Reagent
and Materials
Ammonium fluoride
(NH4F), yttrium oxide (Y2O3, 99.99%),
erbium oxide (Er2O3, 99.99%), ytterbium oxide
(Yb2O3, 99.99%), TCS, certificated reference
material (CRM), BPA, DCP, PCP, potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. PAA (Mw = 2000) was obtained
from Acros Organics. Concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ethylene
glycol (EG) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Sodium chloride (NaCl)
and CP were purchased from Oriental Chemical Industries and Junsei
Chemical Company, respectively. A stock solution of TCS (0.345 mM)
was prepared in 5 mL of acetone solution (acetone/water = 5:95, v/v).
All other reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without
any further purification.

4.2 Preparation of Hydrophilic
NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ UCNPs and Coated
by KMnO4
PAA-capped NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanoparticles were synthesized using the following
method.44 Typically, NaCl (2.4 mmol), RECl3 (Y:Er:Yb = 80:2:18, 0.1 mmol), PAA 0.3 g were dissolved in
15 mL
of EG and then NH4F (5 mmol) in 5 mL of EG was added while
stirring. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for
30 min and then transferred to a 30 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The
autoclave was heated at 200 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room
temperature, the precipitates were separated from the mixture by centrifugation
and washed with DW and ethanol several times, and dried in a vacuum
oven at 50 °C overnight. The obtained UCNPs were dispersed in
PBS buffer at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. To use the UCNPs for the
detection of TCS, 1.65 mmol of KMnO4 was dissolved in PBS
buffer and was added to the solution of UCNPs with stirring at room
temperature for 2 h. The obtained UCNPs@KMnO4 samples were
washed with DW for removing excess potassium, free manganese ions,
and then re-dispersed in PBS buffer.

4.3 Detection
of TCS
To a solution of
1.625 mL of the UCNPs coated with KMnO4 (UCNPs@KMnO4) were added various amounts of TCS and then filled up to
3 mL by PBS buffer (pH 7.4). The TCS concentration in this experiment
was in the range of 2–200 μM. The mixture was stirred
at room temperature for 1 h. After the reaction, the fluorescence
intensity was recorded under an excitation wavelength of 980 nm.

4.4 Sample Preparation
The availability
of the proposed sensor was assessed by studying samples of tap water,
hand-wash product, and four tubes of toothpastes. The tap water samples
were collected from our laboratory at Changwon National University.
Before use, the water samples were filtrated by using a 0.22 μm
syringe filter and maintained at 4 °C in the dark.45 The commercial hand-wash product (0.5 g) was
dissolved in 25 mL methanol with sonication for 30 min. After filtration,
the solution was diluted 25-fold with DW. A stock solution of TCS
(0.345 mM) was prepared by dissolving 99.89 mg of TCS in 5 mL of acetone
and diluted with deionized water. Spiked samples were obtained by
adding TCS solutions with different concentrations. The toothpaste
samples that were analyzed to determine their TCS content were acquired
at local markets. These samples were prepared by dispersing 1.25 g
of toothpaste in 25 mL of DW under sonication for 15 min. The resulting
suspension was diluted 25-fold with DW, and filtered by using 0.45
μm syringe filters.46

4.5 Characterizations
The crystal structure
was determined using XRD (X’Pert PW3040/00, PANalytical; Almelo,
The Netherlands) using Cu Kα (ratio Kα2/Kα1 = 0.5) radiation with step mode (step size 0.02). The morphology
of the samples was determined by FE-SEM (CZ/MIRA II LMH, Tescan, Czech).
EDS emission spectra were measured using an EDAX X-ray detector incorporated
with the FE-SEM. The electron beam was accelerated at 20 kV. FT-IR
spectra were obtained using a Nicolet iS10 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Madison, USA). The UCL emission spectra were recorded
with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Acton SpectraPro 750-triplet
grating monochromator) containing a charge coupled device detector
(Princeton EEV 1024 × 1024 and PI-Max 133 controller). A 980
nm laser diode was used as an excitation source, and was placed at
an angle of 45° in front of the sample holder.
