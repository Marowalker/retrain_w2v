Roll-to-roll
hot embossing could revolutionize the manufacturing
of multifunctional polymer films with the ability to process large
area at a high rate with reduced cost. The continuous hot embossing
of the films, however, has been hindered due to the lack of durable
and flexible molds, which can replicate micro and nanofeatures with
reliability over several embossing cycles. In this work, we demonstrate
for the first time the fabrication of a flexible polymer (polyimide)
mold from the commercially available sheet by a maskless photolithography
approach combined with inductively coupled plasma etching and its
potential application to the roll-to-roll hot embossing process. The
flexible polyimide mold consisted of holes with controlled dimensions:
diameter: 14 μm, spacing: 16.5 μm, and depth: 6.8 μm.
The reliability of flexible polyimide mold was tested and implemented
by embossing micron-sized features on a commercial thermoplastic polymer,
polyamide, and thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) sheet. The polyimide
mold replicated micron-sized features on polymer substrates (polyamide
and TPE) with excellent fidelity and was durable even after numerous
embossing cycles.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Large-area structuring
of polymer surfaces with micro- and/or nanostructures
has widespread applications in areas of self-cleaning surfaces, sensors,1 biodevices,2 flexible
displays,3 waveguides,4 and MEMs devices.5 A high demand
exists in the manufacturing of such surface structures at low cost
and improved productivity. To address this challenge, static hot embossing
(SHE)6 and nanoimprint lithography (NIL)7 processes were introduced for micro-/nanostructuring
in polymers.

In a typical SHE process, a thermoplastic polymer
sheet is heated
above the glass transition temperature (Tg) and imprinted by a mold containing the micro-/nanostructures. Due
to the applied temperature and pressure, the softened polymer sheet
undergoes mold filling; subsequently, the embossed polymer sheet with
micro-/nanostructures is cooled below the Tg before demolding. Molds are a critical part of the micro/nanostructuring
process. Since the process involves softening a polymer sheet beyond Tg and application of high pressure (16 MPa),
the molds must possess sufficient strength to survive such extreme
environments and also last for many runs. The SHE process employs
planar molds typically made from electroplating of nickel over a master
template fabricated either by photolithography8 or e-beam lithography9 (depending on
the feature size), epoxy,10 and deep reactive
ion etching11 or potassium hydroxide wet
etching in silicon.12 Silicon wafers, being
extremely fragile, are somewhat limited in their widespread acceptance
as a mold material in SHE processes, and often nickel is used as a
mold.13

In contrast to the SHE process,
the NIL process consists of two
variants depending on the type of polymer and its associated curing
mechanism: thermal NIL (hot embossing) and ultraviolet NIL (UV-NIL).13 In thermal NIL, a thermoplastic polymer resist
is heated above the glass transition temperature (Tg) and imprinted by a mold containing nanostructures/patterns.
Under the influence of temperature, pressure (typically about 0.3–10
MPa), and time, the polymer resist undergoes mold filling, allowing
complete replication of nanostructures. In the next stage, the polymer
resist is cooled below the Tg to attain
necessary stiffness before they are separated from the mold. Similar
processing steps exist in the case of UV-NIL, but the surface structuring
is performed with a UV-curable resist. The resist is coated over a
transparent polymer substrate and undergoes hardening by UV irradiation.
Since the imprinting is done at room temperature using a liquid resist,
less pressure (∼0.3 MPa) is needed to force the polymer into
the cavities during imprinting. Thus, the requirements for the mold
material in terms of strength and thermal stability are insignificant
compared to the SHE process.13

For
the UV-NIL process, UV-transparent molds are made from poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS),14 polyurethane acrylate,15 poly(vinyl chloride),16 quartz17,18 and organic–inorganic hybrid resin.19 The flexible molds are either cast or thermally
imprinted from a master template (silicon and quartz) containing nanostructures
fabricated via traditional e-beam or deep UV lithography and reactive
ion etching. PDMS molds, however, do not possess sufficient elastic
modulus to withstand the pressure and temperature encountered in the
thermal NIL process. Due to its low elastic modulus, PDMS molds are
not preferred to replicate high density sub-100 nm resolution features
limiting their widespread acceptance as a mold material.13 Electroformed nickel, perfluoropolyether (PFPE),
and acrylate are commonly used as mold materials in the thermal NIL
process due to their high modulus (1.6 GPa for PFPE) and excellent
release properties arising from their low surface energy (e.g., PFPE).20 Additionally, PFPE can become soft above a certain
temperature, which enables easy replication from an original silicon
or quartz master template via the thermal NIL process. Nevertheless,
the two processes, SHE and NIL, suffer in terms of productivity as
they are batch processes and have long cycle times (around 30 min).

Alternative continuous processing methodologies such as roll-to-roll
nanoimprint lithography (R2R-NIL, both thermal and UV),21 roll-to-roll extrusion coating (R2R-EC),22 and roll-to-roll hot embossing (R2R-HE)23 were introduced to improve the productivity
for surface structuring over large areas. The successful implementation
of roll-to-roll technologies for large-area imprinting of micro-/nanostructures
depends on both the availability of flexible mold materials and their
fabrication technology. The mold material used for roll-to-roll processes
must be flexible, whereas other requirements, such as the ability
to withstand temperature and pressure (around 5 MPa), depend on the
physical state (solid or liquid) and rheology of the polymer used
for the imprinting process. For example, the imprinting step in R2R-NIL
process via UV (R2R-UV-NIL) is performed on a liquid polymer resist
at room temperature and low pressure. Thus, PDMS is widely used as
a mold material due to inherent flexibility and ease of fabrication
(e.g., PDMS casting).24 Although PDMS has
sufficient flexibility and low surface energy, it lacks sufficient
elastic modulus/stiffness and cannot be used as a flexible mold in
the R2R-NIL via the thermal process (R2R-TNIL) because of the high
temperature and moderate nip pressure encountered during imprinting
of the liquid resist.25 Ahn et al.21 reported the use of tetrafluoroethylene as a
flexible mold for R2R-TNIL and R2R-UV-NIL processes due to inherent
thermal stability, high modulus (∼1.2 GPa), and low surface
energy (15.6 dyn/cm), which helps in easy demolding of nanostructures
without requiring additional low surface energy antistiction coatings.
Line structures of 70 nm in width were replicated by R2R-TNIL and
R2R-UV-NIL processes. Two types of liquid resists were utilized for
the work: a PDMS-based resist for R2R-TNIL and an epoxy silicone resist
for R2R-UV-NIL process.

In the R2R-HE process, imprinting is
performed on a polymer sheet
above the Tg and below the melting temperature
(Tm) of the polymer, so a relatively higher
pressure (typically around 5 MPa) is required to force a highly viscous
softened polymer into the micro-/nanocavities of the mold as compared
to the liquid resists used in the R2R-TNIL process. As a result, the
mold material should have high modulus, strength, thermal stability,
and durability. Typically, for R2R-HE, metallic shims made of nickel
consisting of negative relief structures, which are typically obtained
by electroforming from positive silicon master templates, are candidates
for flexible molds.26 Other fabrication
techniques to prepare nickel tooling include, micromachining,27 microelectric discharge machining,28 and femtosecond laser29 structuring, which offer high accuracy and an easier route for flexible
mold fabrication for feature sizes generally above 10 μm.26 In the case of structures below 10 μm,
lithography (LIGA: Lithographie, Galvanoformung, Abformung)-based
processes such as E-beam LIGA,30 UV-LIGA,31 X-ray LIGA,32 and
laser-LIGA33 have been widely used to fabricate
molds. The molds prepared using these methods are two-dimensional
(flat), but they can be wrapped around a roller. When such molds are
wrapped around the rollers, however, they leave a seam or discontinuity
in the imprinted structures. This seam can be a problem for microelectronics,
microfluidics, and displays. To overcome this limitation, seamless
roller molds were introduced.26

Seamless
roller molds are fabricated either by curved surface lithography34 or direct laser interference patterning (DLIP).35 Curved surface lithography using UV, e-beam,
or X-ray follows similar steps as in the conventional lithography
process. The only difference is that patterning, exposure, chemical
development, etching, and electropolishing are all performed on a
curved roller surface using appropriate photoresists. Striegel et
al.36 successfully demonstrated the fabrication
of a continuous nickel sleeve via curved surface UV lithography, which
allowed the replication of circumferential channel or groove-like
structures with a depth of 5 μm by R2R-HE on a variety of substrates,
including polypropylene, poly(tetrafluoroethylene), polyetheretherketone,
polyethersulfone, polysulfone, aluminum, and copper. Seamless mold
fabrication by DLIP offers several advantages such as high-resolution
patterning and fast operation, as it relies on the generation of the
interference pattern by overlapping two or more laser beams over the
substrate surface. Corresponding to the locations of interference
maxima, the substrate surface can be ablated either by photothermal
or photochemical routes.37 Rank et al.35 employed the DLIP method in combination with
a picosecond laser source to structure nickel sleeves with periodic
linelike microstructures having spatial periods between 1.5 and 5
μm. The resulting nickel sleeves were then used for R2R-HE of
a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film at web speeds ranging from
2 to 50 m/min. Several limitations exist for both curved surface lithography
and DLIP fabrication techniques. The former method utilizes expensive
masks whose fabrication is not trivial as it is laborious, requires
a sophisticated rotation stage equipped with a high-precision step
motor adding to complexity and manufacturing costs.38 The latter technique has shortcomings with regards to the
feature size and geometry (i.e., only periodic sinusoidal structures
can be made using DLIP).35

Considerable
attention has been given to the use of polyimide as
polymeric molds in UV-NIL, static hot embossing (thermal NIL), and
microinjection molding processes due to their inherent flexibility,
similar coefficient of thermal expansion with the polymer substrate
used for imprinting, high glass transition temperature (Tg), exceptional thermal stability and good mechanical
and chemical properties. Wu et al.39 fabricated
flexible polyimide molds (PI1, PI2, and PI3) by casting synthesized
polyimide solutions with (PI2 and PI3) and without (PI1) fluorine
groups on a silicon master template. Thermal NIL was performed using
the PI1 mold on a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) liquid resist coated
over a transparent PET substrate. The UV-NIL process was conducted
using molds PI2 and PI3 on a UV-curable photoresist coated over a
PET substrate. Successful transfer and demolding of micro- (19 μm)
and nanostructures (140 nm) were observed for PI2 and PI3 molds without
requiring a low surface energy release layer due to the presence of
fluorine groups on the backbone chain; an additional low surface energy
treatment, however, was applied to the PI1 mold for easy release.
The viscosity of PMMA liquid resist was extremely low, and only 0.02
MPa pressure was applied during the thermal imprinting process. Prior
work by Kim et al.40 investigated the use
of polyimide–chromium hybrid tooling under high temperature,
high shear, and high-pressure environments of the injection molding
process. The results showed better replication of microfeatures at
lower mold and melt temperature with polyimide tooling compared to
the polymer-backed silicon molds, and this was attributed to the longer
solidification times caused due to the delayed heat transfer by the
polyimide hybrid molds.

In this study, we report the use of
a flexible polyimide mold in
the R2R-HE process, which was fabricated by a maskless photolithography
approach using a commercially available polyimide sheet. The proposed
mold fabrication methodology eliminates the need for complex electroplating
steps, thus allowing an easier route to produce flexible polymeric
molds for the R2R-HE process. This approach is particularly advantageous
for preliminary studies and prototyping as it enables quick and low-cost
fabrication of the molds. To satisfy the requirements of high mechanical
strength (modulus) and flexibility, a detailed evaluation of the mold
material with respect to mechanical, thermal, and dynamic mechanical
properties was performed and compared with polymer substrates used
for the imprinting process. Finally, the reliability of the flexible
polyimide mold was evaluated by embossing microfeatures on polyamide
and thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) sheet.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Fabrication of Flexible Polyimide Mold
The flexible polymer mold was fabricated on a commercially available
polyimide sheet (thickness: 140 μm) (Kapton B, Dupont, Wilmington,
DE) (please note that this PI sheet is UV transparent). The roughness
of the polymer sheet was critical for this process. Several other
PI sheets were too rough for this application.

The preliminary
investigation was performed to fabricate flexible polyimide mold with
the lift-off and dry etching processes using the titanium as a metal
mask. The lift-off and dry etching fabrication procedures produced
microstructures with poor dimensional control. In addition, flexible
polyimide mold fabricated via the dry etching method was only useful
to produce shallow microstructures with a very low aspect ratio (height/diameter
= 0.1:1) due to poor etch selectivity between the titanium metal mask
and the polyimide layer. To overcome these shortcomings, an alternative
robust fabrication route as outlined below was employed.

First,
a 1000-Å-thick layer of nickel was deposited on the
polyimide substrate using e-beam evaporation. The processing parameters
for nickel deposition are listed in Table 1. In the next step, a photoresist (Shipley,
Microposit S1813, Newton, MA) was spin-coated on the nickel-coated
polyimide using a speed of 2000 rpm and time of 60 s and then was
soft-baked at 115 °C for 60 s. Features with desired diameter
and spacing were created in the photoresist with the Direct Write
system (Heidelberg Instruments, Heidelberg, Germany). The features
then were developed for 40–60 s using a commercial developer
(Megaposit MF-26A, Dow Electronic Materials, Marlborough, MA), which
removed photoresist from the holes and exposed the nickel. The photoresist
was hard-baked at 180 °C for 6 min. After hard baking of the
photoresist, nickel was selectively removed from the holes using a
chemical etchant (i.e., nickel protected by the photoresist was not
etched). Then, the hard-baked photoresist was removed using acetone
and isopropyl. With the nickel mask left, the polyimide was dry-etched
using an inductively coupled plasma etching technique. The detailed
schematic representation of the fabrication methodology is outlined
in Figure 1.

polyimide mold. The overall process flow was (1) deposition of nickel

2.2 Roll-to-Roll Hot Embossing of Trapezoidal
Structures
Two polymeric materials were used to evaluate
the fabricated polyimide mold in the R2R-HE process. First, a 200-μm-thick
thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) sheet based on the acrylic block co-polymer
was obtained from Kuraray Co. Ltd. (grade: Kurarity) and, second,
a microcrystalline polyamide was extruded into 300-μm-thick
sheet. The microcrystalline polyamide pellets (Trogamid CX7323) purchased
from Evonik-Industries were extruded using a twin-screw extruder (TECHNOVEL
Corporation, Osaka, Japan, model KZW 15TW) and a sheet die with a
coat hanger manifold. The polyamide’s low melt strength required
a film extrusion configuration in which the die feds melt downward
onto the chill rolls. Prior to extrusion, polymer pellets were dried
at 95 °C for 8 h. Lower-than-recommended barrel and die temperatures
(232–252 °C) prevented degradation during extrusion, and
high chill roll temperatures (140 °C) mandated oil heating of
the chill rolls. These parameters enabled the extrusion of 150-mm-wide
polyamide sheet.

For hot embossing, the flexible polyimide mold
with the 14-μm-diameter holes was mounted on a steel roller.
During the mounting procedure, the fabricated polyimide mold was bonded
onto a polyimide belt using a high-temperature epoxy adhesive. Then,
the flexible polyimide mold and belt assembly were wrapped around
the roller by placing it firmly inside a machined slot using bolts
and steel plates (as shown in Figure 2, top section). For embossing, the polyamide and TPE
sheets were held between two rollers. The rolls softened the sheet;
it was not preheated. On the application of suitable nip pressure
and roll speed, the softened polymer was forced into the microcavities
of flexible polyimide mold. A graphical representation of the roll-to-roll
hot embossing process is illustrated in Figure 2 (bottom). The robustness of fabricated polyimide
mold for embossing was evaluated by varying the mold temperatures
(Tpolyimide), whereas the nip pressure
(PNip) and roll speed (VR) were kept constant. The process parameters are listed
in Table 2.

R2R-HE process (bottom). The flexible polyimide mold fabricated using
the methodology shown in Figure 1 (step 7) is mounted over a polyimide belt using a
steel plate and bolts assembly (top).

2.3 Characterization
2.3.1 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
(DMA)
DMA of the unstructured polyimide, polyamide, and TPE
sheet was carried
out in tensile mode using the TA Instrument machine (DMA Q800). Temperature
sweeps tests were performed over a temperature range of −150
to 200 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C/min, a frequency of
1 Hz, and a strain amplitude of 30 μm. The storage modulus (E′), loss modulus (E″), and
loss tangent (tan δ = E″/E′) were measured and analyzed as a function of temperature.

2.3.2 Thermogravimetric Analysis
The
thermal stability of the unstructured polyimide, polyamide, and TPE
sheet was determined using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A TA
Instruments (model: Q50) with a heating rate of 20 °C/min and
a temperature range from 20 to 800 °C in nitrogen atmosphere
was used for these measurements.

2.3.3 Field
Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
(FESEM)
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM,
Joel, model: JSM-7401F) was used to record the trapezoidal structures
fabricated on the polyamide surface. FESEM measurements were conducted
at an acceleration voltage of 10.0 kV. The sample surfaces were gold-coated
to avoid charging on exposure to electron beam during the measurements.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Fabrication
and Thermomechanical Characterization
of Flexible Polyimide Mold
The optical microscopy images
of the polyimide mold (fabricated as outlined in Figure 1) during various stages of
fabrication, post chemical development, after wet etching of exposed
nickel layer, and after dry etching, are shown in Figure 3a–c, respectively. The
resulting tooling after the dry etching step had holes with consistent
diameters of 14 μm, spacings of 16.5 μm, and depths of
6.8 μm; the accuracy of these dimensions was validated using
FESEM image (Figure 3d) and surface profilometry (not shown here). The measured feature
dimensions were comparable to those reported in the literature with
a special exclusion to the features in nanometer length scale fabricated
via casting route, as demonstrated previously by Wu and co-workers.39 The smallest feature dimensions that can be
fabricated using the methodology (outlined in Figure 1) were dependent on the laser diode wavelength
used in the Direct Write system (Heidelberg Instruments, Heidelberg,
Germany) and the surface roughness of unstructured polyimide sheet.

various stages of fabrication: (a) post chemical development, (b)

of the polyimide mold after the dry etching step, and (d) SEM image
of the actual polyimide mold.

The efficient demolding of microfeatures is important to
maintain
the fidelity of the embossed features. To reduce adhesion forces between
the tooling and polymer sheet, a 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane
(PFTS) antistiction coating was vapor-deposited on the fabricated
tooling. The untreated flat polyimide showed a water contact angle
of 76° (Figure 4a), whereas the fabricated polyimide tooling after deposition of
a PFTS antistiction layer displayed a contact angle of 117° (Figure 4b) for water, indicating
a hydrophobic, low surface energy substrate, expected to assist in
demolding of the embossed microfeatures.

Figure 4 Static water contact
angle result measured on (a) the flat untreated
polyimide sheet and (b) PFTS-treated polyimide mold surface.

For the R2R-HE process, a mold
must possess the flexibility to
be wrapped around the roller, high mechanical strength (modulus) at
processing temperature to withstand high nip pressure, thermal stability
to prevent degradation at processing temperature, and durability for
repeated use.10,40 A flexible mold can provide a
larger conformal contact with the substrate, thereby reducing the
pressure required during the embossing step. Additionally, a flexible
mold enables easy demolding of embossed microfeatures due to a smaller
demolding area relative to a rigid mold.25 It is also reported that the Tg of the
polymer material being used as a flexible mold is considered critical
for performance, and the mold material should have a higher Tg compared to the polymers that will be embossed
to avoid tooling damage.10,40 Thus, it is necessary
to evaluate the mechanical and thermal performance of the mold substrate
for successful implementation in the roll-to-roll hot embossing process.

The storage modulus (E′), loss modulus
(E″), and loss tangent (tan δ
= E″/E′) of the unstructured
polyimide, polyamide, and TPE were measured as a function of temperature
(Figure 5a–c).
From the tan δ and E″ curves
of the TPE sheet, two peaks at about −45 and 105 °C were
due to the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the poly(butyl acrylate) soft segment and poly(methyl methacrylate)
hard segment, respectively. Similarly, for the polyamide, two transition
peaks appeared at about −60 and 128 °C. The transition
peak at −60 °C was considered an indication of the ß
transition from the formation of hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl
group of polyamide and absorbed water molecules.41 A narrow and tall tan δ peak at 128 °C (α
transition: Tg) was due to the amorphous
regions (Figure 5c).42 There was a slight increase in the modulus value
of polyamide at temperatures beyond 150 °C because of the cold
crystallization phenomenon, as reported elsewhere.43 The E′ values for the polyimide
were fairly high across the tested temperature range, whereas E′ decreased rapidly for polyamide and TPE due to
the increased segmental motions at the glass transition temperature.
The high value of E′ for polyimide was primarily
due to the presence of bulky aromatic groups in the backbone chain,
which explains the observed mechanical rigidity. The polyimide exhibited
no transitions over the range investigated; this behavior demonstrated
the mechanical rigidity at embossing temperatures, whereas the polymers
substrates showed a decrease in modulus, indicating the polyimide’s
suitability as a mold material.

and TPE samples using
DMA analysis, illustrating the variation of (a) storage modulus, (b)
loss modulus, (c) tan δ(E″/E′) (loss tangent), and (d) absolute value of complex
viscosity as a function of temperature.

The absolute values of complex viscosity vs temperature curves
for the unstructured polyimide, polyamide, and TPE are presented in Figure 5d. The polymer viscosity
underwent a sudden drop around 128 and 105 °C as the temperature
exceeded the Tg of the polyamide and TPE,
respectively. There was a slight increase in the viscosity of polyamide
at a temperature above 150 °C, again the result of the cold crystallization
phenomenon.43

The thermal stability
of the polyimide mold material was evaluated
from TGA (Figure 6a,b).
The higher Tmax (580 °C) of the polyimide
compared to the polyamide sheet (Tmax =
450 °C) and TPE sheet (Tmax = 380
°C) was due to the presence of bulky aromatic groups, which have
a direct influence on the thermal stability. This result showed that
polyimide could withstand the high temperature and nip pressures that
are often encountered during the roll-to-roll hot embossing process
and again supports the use of polyimide as an alternative flexible
mold material.

3.2 Evaluation
of Flexible Polyimide Mold by Roll-to-Roll
Hot Embossing Process
The forming accuracy in roll-to-roll
hot embossing is primarily influenced by roll speed, mold temperature,
and nip pressure; the sheet sometimes is preheated using infrared
radiation.26,44 This work employed the highest
nip pressure (PNip) of 3.7 MPa and the
lowest roll speed of 0.1 m/min to expose the polyimide mold to a high-pressure
environment for a longer duration. In the roll-to-roll hot embossing
process, preheating of the polymer sheet reduces the temperature loss
when the sheet contacts the tooling surface. Prior work,40 however, reported excellent replication of the
injection molded microstructured surfaces at lower mold and melt temperatures,
because the polyimide–metal hybrid tooling retarded heat transfer,
leading to delays in melt solidification times. In addition, the microstructures
had low aspect ratios (height/diameter = 0.5:1). Therefore, preheating
of the sheet was not required (preliminary work confirmed this decision).
Only the polyimide mold temperature (Tpolyimide) (mounted on a steel roller) was varied to evaluate the performance
of the fabricated polyimide mold. Selection of the mold temperatures
was based on the absolute complex viscosity values of the two polymers,
polyamide, and TPE, studied as a function of temperature (Figure 5d).

Replication
of microstructures was observed on the polyamide (Figure 7) and TPE (Figure 8), indicating the effectiveness
of polyimide as a mold for the R2R-HE process. Uniform and complete
replication occurred at all mold temperatures in both polyamide (Figure 7a–c) and TPE
(Figure 8a–c).
The cross-sectional SEM image of the embossed polyamide sheet (Figure 7e) indicates that
the structures were completely replicated, i.e., 100% replication
efficiency, giving measured dimensions of a 14 μm diameter,
6.8 μm height, and 16.5 μm spacing (edge-to-edge), which
were identical to the dimensions of the polyimide mold dimensions
(diameter of 14 μm, depth of 6.8 μm, and spacing of 16.5
μm). With the commercial TPE sheet, replication efficiency also
was 100%, and the embossed structures had identical dimensions to
those of the polyimide mold dimensions. These dimensions and the well-defined
shapes shown in Figure 8 suggest that the slower cooling with the polyimide mold enabled
relaxation of the TPE material to occur during embossing, rather than
after the features were separated from the mold.

and (c) 150 °C. Identical images of the microstructures when

measured from the 90° tilt view and top view were of the diameter
of 14 μm, height of 6.8 μm, and spacing (edge-to-edge)
of 16.5 μm.

°C. Identical images of the microstructures when viewed at an
oblique angle of 85° is shown as the inset. The embossed microstructures
had similar dimensions to the polyamide mold, i.e., diameters of 14
μm, heights of 6.8 μm, and edge-to-edge spacings of 16.5
μm.

The flexible polyimide mold showed
the capability to withstand
the high nip pressure (3.7 MPa) and temperatures (90–150 °C)
for an embossing duration of 5–10 s in the R2R-HE process.
The polyimide mold was also found to be durable for more than 50 embossing
cycles. Preliminary work had already been performed by our group to
evaluate the durability of polyimide mold (not shown in the manuscript).
A low-density polyethylene sheet was used for the study to replicate
microstructures. The polyimide mold was durable and maintained excellent
robustness event after 100 embossing cycles at a embossing temperature
(80–100 °C), nip pressure (3.7 MPa), and embossing duration
(5–30 s). Further work would be needed to establish the ultimate
limit of the tooling.

continuous and large-area fabrication of micro-/nanostructures
on a polymer surface by the R2R-HE process has numerous applications.
The primary roadblock in the widespread application of this manufacturing
technology is the availability of flexible tooling/mold materials
and their fabrication approaches that are compatible with the R2R-HE
process for the evaluation of different dimensions during development.
The availability of low-cost tooling for preliminary development would
enable more widespread applications in R2R-HE. To address this challenge,
we demonstrated the fabrication of a robust flexible polyimide mold
for the R2R-HE process. A polyimide mold containing holes with a diameter
of 14 μm, the spacing of 16.5 μm, and a depth of 6.8 μm
was successfully prepared by lithographic techniques using a maskless
Direct Write system, followed by etching of the features into a commercially
available polyimide sheet. The use of commercially available materials
assists in more rapid use of the mold materials. The thermal and dynamic
mechanical properties of the mold material were studied to meet the
criteria of thermal stability, high mechanical strength (modulus),
and flexibility, which are essential for the R2R-HE process. The resulting
mold was then evaluated and applied in the R2R-HE process by embossing
microstructures onto two polymeric materials: polyamide and TPE sheet.
The flexible polyimide mold was able to withstand the high pressure
(3.7 MPa) and temperatures (90–150 °C) encountered in
the R2R-HE process and to completely replicate the microfeatures in
polyamide and TPE sheet. The flexible mold fabrication methodology
and the associated understanding of material properties needed for
the flexible molding materials provides a promising pathway for the
design of new advanced flexible tooling and its implementation for
large-area structuring of polymer films by the R2R-HE process.
