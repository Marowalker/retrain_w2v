Considering the huge demands for
economical and reliable eco-remediation
applications, the goal of the present work is to synthesize cost-effective
and functionally efficient magnetic layered nanocomposite adsorbents
for the effective adsorption of dyes followed by easy separation from
wastewater. This would ensure good reusability of adsorbents without
altering its adsorption capacity in a relatively short time manner.
To achieve this, different molecular weights of polyethylene glycol
(PEG)-modified Fe3O4 combined with Mg–Al-layered
double hydroxides (MAN-LDH) were synthesized and characterized using
powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron
microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis,
differential thermal analysis, energy-dispersive X-ray, and inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The efficacy of various
adsorption parameters for the removal of methyl orange (MO) from water
using Fe3O4-PEG-Mg-Al-LDH (FPL) adsorbents with
different molecular weights of PEG (2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL) were investigated,
and the results were compared. The maximum adsorption capacities of
2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL for MO were found to be 775.19, 826.44, and 833.33
mg/g, respectively. Detailed adsorption studies confirm that the higher
adsorption capacity of 6FPL is due to the fast exchange of anions
(NO3–) by MO in the interlayers of MAN-LDH,
larger surface area, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interaction
between adsorbate and adsorbent. The thermodynamic data indicate that
the adsorption behavior is spontaneous and endothermic in nature.
The reusability of all FPL adsorbents is observed to be excellent.
The MAN-LDH recoated after the 31st-cycle nanocomposites show a recovery
of 100% adsorption efficiency, similar to the freshly prepared 6FPL.
Such systematic studies greatly help in advancing the applications
of newly functionalized nanomaterials toward eco-remediation approaches.

1 Introduction
Water
is now becoming a scarce resource globally and no longer
treated as a free commodity.1 In many countries,
clean water is a paid and taxable amenity.2 Improper management of industrial effluent, mainly organic dyes,
is one of the main reasons for environmental damage because of their
complex structure and low bio-degradability.3−5 Among various
dyes, azo dyes such as methyl orange (MO), which are frequently used
in many industries, can produce roughly 20 categories of carcinogenic
aromatic amines that can alter the human DNA construction.6−9 Researchers from different areas have come together to find ultramodern,
efficient, recyclable adsorbents to remove dyes from the effluent.10−14 However, the major problems are low adsorption capacity, difficulty
in separating the adsorbed dyes, and their less-efficient reusability.
Among the various methods, adsorption method shows promising results
due to its advantages of being reversible and reusable, and it removes
dyes in a large scale.15−17

In recent times, research on the magnetic adsorbent
materials gains
vital importance because of their unique physical and chemical properties.
Especially, magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles
are gaining importance in the area of wastewater management.18 Due to their superparamagnetic property after
reaching saturation in the adsorption process, the magnetic adsorbents
can be easily separated from a solution with the support of an external
magnetic field without using tedious filtration or centrifugation,
and thus they exhibit high efficiency in wastewater treatment.18 In fact, the alteration of morphology and dimension
is crucial in planning and developing adsorbents with novel adsorption
properties.

The distinctive multiple positively charged metal
cationic two-dimensional
laminate with an interlayer balancing anion and huge interlayer spaces
is obtainable by precise chemical composition and an appropriate number
of exchangeable anions. The large surface area of layered double hydroxides
(LDH) offers high potential for adsorption and catalysis in biological
and pharmaceutical applications.19 LDHs
are a member of two-dimensional anionic clays or hydrotalcite-like
compounds with the general formula [MII1 – xMIIIx(OH)2]x+(An–)x/n.yH2O, where MII denotes a divalent cation, MIII represents a trivalent cation, and An– is an interlayer anion; x is defined
as the molar ratio of MII and MIII metal ions.20 The structure of LDH is constructed as brucite-like
layers (Mg(OH)2)− in which the cations
are surrounded by octahedral of OH– groups.21 These octahedral units form infinite layers
by edge-sharing, and these layers are stacked on top of one another
to form the 3D structure.22

In addition
to increasing the dye adsorption capacity of adsorbents,
a new research area has emerged that aims to design Fe3O4 surface modified with LDH-based adsorbents for dye
removal.23 Fe3O4-based
LDH hierarchical structures have evoked considerable interest due
to their excellent characteristics such as large surface area, enlarged
interlayer free space, combination of numerous functionalities good
separation efficiency with better successive reusability and a simple
isolation with a magnet.24 Magnetic layered
nanocomposites with a core–shell structural design have notable
attention due to their distinctive morphology, stability and specifically
the magnetic properties. They have the ability to remove dyes from
an aqueous solution.25

The intention
of this current work is to produce effective magnetic
layered nanocomposite adsorbents to ease the separation of dyes after
adsorption from wastewater to ensure the reusability along with high
adsorption capacity within a short time. For that purpose, we synthesized
a new magnetic nanocomposite material containing Mg–Al LDH
(MAN-LDH), different molecular weights of polyethylene glycol (PEG),
and magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4). The main objective is to amplify the ability of adsorption of
a dye at the surface of MAN-LDH deposited over Fe3O4-PEG (FP) and at the same time the reusability of nanocomposites
by magnetic separation. Here, we report the synthesis of Fe3O4-PEG-MAN-LDH (FPL) nanocomposites and their characterization
and adsorption activity toward MO dyes in an aqueous medium. The impact
of several parameters such as adsorbent dose, initial dye concentration,
adsorption rate, temperature, pH, and reusability of adsorbents on
MO adsorption of FPL was studied. The adsorption kinetics, isotherms,
and thermodynamic parameters have also been investigated. To our knowledge,
this is one of the important reports with considerably higher adsorption
capacity along with rapid adsorption of MO using FPL adsorbents compared
to existing reported adsorbents.

2 Results
and Discussion
The different molecular weight of PEG-modified
Fe3O4 and its respective MAN-LDH-deposited nanocomposites
were
successfully synthesized. Figure 1a reveals the diffraction patterns of Fe3O4, 1.5FP, 2FP, 4FP, and 6FP and the diffraction peaks
at 2θ were 30.23, 35.69, 43.23, 57.19, and 62.79°, correlating
with the (220), (311), (400), (511), and (400) planes, respectively,26 and it confirms the presence of standard magnetite
(Fe3O4) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
a cubic spinel structure. No notable variation in the basic crystal
structure of the 1.5FP, 2FP, 4FP, and 6FP was observed. Figure 1b displays the MAN-LDH diffraction
peaks at 2θ were 11.42, 22.97, 31.86, 38.86, and 48.02°,
correlating with the (003), (006), (012), (015), and (018) diffraction
planes obtained in the LDH structure, respectively.23−25The XRD spectrum
of FPL containing the peaks of both Fe3O4-PEG
and MAN-LDH proves that both phases are present in the structure of
magnetic layered nanocomposites.27,28 The entire
XRD patterns reveal the presence of both Fe3O4 and MAN-LDH in the newly formed magnetic layered nanocomposites
(FPL).

and 6FP and (b) 1.5FPL, 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL.

FT-IR studies were carried out to analyze the surface modification
of Fe3O4 by PEG molecules. Figure 2a displays the FT-IR spectra
of Fe3O4, free 6kPEG, and 6FP. The spectrum
of Fe3O4 showed characteristic bands correlated
to the Fe–O vibrations close to 628 (shoulder) and 583 cm–1. A broad −O–H stretch around 3416 cm–1 was noticed in 6FP. The spectrum of free 6kPEG showed
that the characteristic bands correlated to the −O–H,
−C–H, and −C–O vibrations are 3433, 2919,
and 1101 cm–1, respectively. Compared with the spectrum
of Fe3O4, there are some new peaks in the spectrum
of 6FP. The bands at 2925 and 1083 cm–1 are related
with the −C–H stretch vibration and −C–O
vibration, respectively; these two vibrations were noticed in both
the free 6kPEG and 6FP.26 The band at 628
(shoulder) and 583 cm–1 are correlated to the Fe–O
vibrations, and these peaks are not detected in the spectrum of 6kPEG.
Thus, it is evident that the PEG-modified Fe3O4 was obtained during hydrothermal reaction. Figure 2b displays the FT-IR spectra of 6FP, MAN-LDH,
and 6FPL. The spectrum of MAN-LDH showed the characteristic bands
correlated to the −O–H, −NO3– anions, and metal oxygen vibrations are 3495, 1381, and 416 cm–1, respectively. The spectrum of 6FPL indicates a mixture
of 6FP and MAN-LDH, with a very small shift observed in the O–H
and C–H stretching bands. The bands at 3450, 2925, 1381, and
394 cm–1 are related to the −O–H,
−C–H, and −NO3– anions
and metal oxygen vibrations, respectively. A shoulder peak is seen
at around 2984 cm–1 for MAN-LDH as well as for 6FPL
and is attributed to the hydrogen bonding between water molecules
and nitrates in the interlayers of MAN-LDH sheets.29−31

and of (b) 6FP, MAN-LDH, and 6FPL.

Surface morphology of the as-developed magnetic nanocomposites
adsorbent is clearly displayed through SEM images. Figure 3 and Figure S1a show the surface morphologies of 6FP, 6FPL, 2FPL, and MAN-LDH
adsorbents. The SEM image of 6FP shows that the surfaces of Fe3O4 were heterogeneous and spherical with an average
diameter of around 16–30 nm. The MAN-LDH image shows a layered
platelet placed one over the other. In the case of FPL nanocomposites,
the MAN-LDH layer associates around the surface of the spherical FP
nanoparticles. These results reveal that the MAN-LDH sheets are closely
anchored around the 6FP.

Figure 3 Morphological evaluation of (a) 6FP and (b)
6FPL by SEM.

The EDS spectra of corresponding
SEM images are presented in Figure S1b.
Fe, Mg, Al, C, H, O, and Na element
signals were identified in the spectra of 6FP, 6FPL, 2FPL, and MAN-LDH.
The presence of Na confirms the deposition of MAN-LDH over FP. Compared
to 6FPL, 2FPL has less percentage of carbon, due to the presence of
a lower molecular weight of PEG. This can be an additional evidence
to confirm that the different molecular weights of PEGs are incorporated
inside the nanocomposites.

Elemental compositions of 6FPL, 2FPL,
6FP, and MAN-LDH in atomic
percentage are given in Table S1. The carbon
content in magnetic layered nanocomposite adsorbents is increasing
in the sequence from 2FPL to 6FPL. This reveals that the presence
of PEG in the 2FPL and 6FPL is on the rise in proportion with the
molecular weight of PEG. The existence of nitrogen in the 6FPL, 2FPL,
and MAN-LDH are due to the availability of interstitial nitrate ions
in the LDH interlayer. It may precede from the precursor salts of
Mg and Al. The presence of the minimum quantity of Na identified in
the 6FPL, 2FPL, and MAN-LDH is possibly attributable to the use of
NaOH during the deposition of MAN-LDH over FP. 6FPL, 2FPL, and MAN-LDH
adsorbents reveal a Mg:Al molar ratio of 3:1, which is used during
the synthesis of nanocomposites. This is a strong proof for the formation
of MAN-LDH over different molecular weights of FP.

The Fe, Mg,
and Al metals in 2FPL, 4FPL, 6FPL, and MAN-LDH nanocomposites
were investigated by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES), as these elements were existing at various
concentration levels. Table S2 clearly
displays the concentration of the metal content in 2FPL, 4FPL, 6FPL,
and MAN-LDH nanocomposites. This result further confirms the presence
of Mg:Al with a molar ratio of 3:1 in newly formed magnetic nanocomposites.

TEM analysis was performed on both the 6FP and 6FPL to study the
particulars of the structures and obtain the additional confirmation. Figure 4a shows the existence
of uniformly well-dispersed nanometer-ranged magnetic particles of
an average diameter around 16–30 nm. Figure 4b exhibits the multiple layers of MAN-LDH
around FP. The dark well-dispersed FP nanoparticles were interred
consistently in the light grey color of FPL.

Figure 4 TEM images of (a) 6FP
and (b) 6FPL.

The TGA curves for 6FP, MAN-LDH,
and 6FPLnanocomposites are shown
in Figure S2a. The TGA curve of 6FP nanoparticles
displayed two stages of weight loss. Nearly 3.1% of weight loss was
found from 25 to 360 °C, which was ascribed mostly to the decomposition
of PEG26,32,33 and removal
of adsorbed water molecules. Above 360 °C, around 15.69% of the
huge weight loss observed was attributed to the phase transition of
Fe3O4 and decomposition of impurities. The TGA
curve of MAN-LDH nanocomposites also exhibited two stages of weight
loss. The first weight loss is due to the loss of physically adsorbed
water in the MAN-LDH. It was close to 1.64% at a temperature range
of 25 to 150 °C. The second huge weight loss is due to the dehydroxylation,
interlayer water molecules, and disappearance of intercalated ions
and, furthermore, the LDH-layered structure collapse by 42.38% at
the temperature range of 250 to 615 °C.34,35

The TGA curves of 6FPL magnetic layered nanocomposites resulted
in two stages of weight loss from room temperature to 800 °C.
The first weight loss of 13.5% in the variation from 175 to 335 °C
is associated with the removal of water molecules, decomposition of
PEG, and the dehydroxylation of the interlayer water molecules and
the fact of intercalated ions. The second major weight loss occurring
(42.32%) in the range of 450 to 700 °C is related to the loss
of LDH structures, formed metal oxides, and the phase transition of
Fe3O4. These weight losses are in good agreement
with 6FP and MAN-LDH, and thus confirming that MAN-LDH deposited over
FP. The TGA data shows the comparatively lesser thermal stability
for 6FP compared to that of the MAN-LDH and 6FPL. The maximum weight
losses as noted at 800 °C for the 6FP, MAN-LDH, and 6FPL are
17.77, 45.13, and 45.95% respectively.35,36 As shown in Figure S3a, the TGA data show comparatively lesser
thermal stability of 6FP than that of LDH, 6FPL, 4FPL, 2FPL, and 1.5FPL.
The total weight loss recorded at 800 °C for 6FP, LDH, 6FPL,
4FPL, 2FPL, and 1.5FPL are 17.77, 45.13, 45.95, 43.63, 47.14, and
45.65%, respectively.

Figure S2b clearly
displays the DTA
curves of 6FP, MAN-LDH and 6FPL, 2FPL, 4FPL, and 1.5FPL. Two stages
of weight loss were obtained in 6FP, and it was noticed as endothermic
peaks. The first decomposition temperature in the range of around
308 °C is coherent to the decomposing of PEG molecules. The second
decomposition temperature at 462.85 °C is attributed to the phase
transition of Fe3O4.26 Two stages of weight loss were found in MAN-LDH in the range of
room temperature to 515 °C, and they were seen as exothermic
peaks. The first decomposition temperature was in the range of room
temperature to 275 °C and is attributed to the removal of surface
water molecules. The second decomposition in the range of 275 to 515
°C is due to dehydroxylation, removal of intercalated anions,
and collapse of the LDH structures.

As indicated by the DTA
curve, 6FPL magnetic layered nanocomposites
show two stages of decomposition temperature within 800 °C as
exothermic peaks. The first decomposition temperature ranges from
room temperature to 250 °C, and it is attributable to the disappearance
of surface-adsorbed water molecules. The second decomposition temperature
of 6FPL shows the temperature range of 250–480 °C. This
is due to the removal of intercalated anions, collapse of the LDH
structures, decomposition of PEG molecules, and dehydroxylation (Figure S3b).

The hysteresis loops was achieved
when magnetic moment (emu/g)
is plotted against field strength (G), as presented
in Figure S4. 6FP exhibits strong magnetism,
and it can be revealed as the saturation magnetization value of 70.00
emu/g.26 6FPL also exhibits magnetism,
but it is relatively less due to the extra layer of shielding by nonmagnetic
MAN-LDH. They have a saturation magnetization value of 10.98 emu/g.37 The saturation magnetism value of 6FPL enables
to separate the adsorbents using an external magnet during adsorption
studies.

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms
and the correlated
pore size dispersals of 6FPL are presented in Figure S5. It reveals a type-IV isotherm with a perfect hysteresis
loop, indicating mesoporous characteristics. The specific surface
area of 6FPL exhibited a value of 18 m2/g. This might be
more desirable for the adsorbate to contact the active sites and achieve
good adsorption capacity. The total pore volume of 6FPL is 0.04 cm3/g. This pore volume of 6FPL could afford more capable conveyance
pathways to their internal voids, which in turn shows increased adsorption
capacity of MO.29,38

2.1 Impact
of the Molecular Weight of PEG on MO
Dye Removal
The MO adsorption capacities of various nanocomposites
with and without MAN-LDH and PEG have been studied and displayed in Figure 5 and Figure S6. MAN-LDH modified FP adsorbents show
an increasing adsorption capacity compared to those that of Fe3O4, FP, MAN-LDH, and Fe3O4-MAN-LDH. Among all the adsorbents, 6FPL has a significant impact
on their adsorption capacity, owing to the large adsorption sites
and exchange of anion capability, and the higher molecular weight
of PEG also plays a major role.39

Figure 5 Adsorption
capacity of various adsorbents toward MO adsorption
(initial MO concentration, 100 mg/L; adsorbent dose, 0.05 g; adsorption
time, 24 min; temperature, 30 °C).

However, the increase in adsorption capacity of 1.5FPL, 2FPL, 4FPL,
and 6FPL are related to the increase in the molecular weight of PEG.
Adsorption capacity of 1.5FPL was found to be low when compared to
those of 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL. Hence, a detailed study was performed
only with 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL. In order to understand the adsorption
ability of 6FPL toward other anionic and cationic dyes, adsorption
studies were carried out with 0.05 g of 6FPL magnetic layered nanocomposites
in 25 mL of a 100 mg/L solution of MO, acid blue 113 (AB-113), Nile
blue A (NB-A), and acid blue 147 (AB-147). The solution was shaken
at 200 rpm up to a predefined contact time at 30 °C until the
equilibrium was reached. The percentage adsorption of MO, AB-113,
NB-A, and AB-147 are exhibited in Figure S7. The percentage adsorption for MO is significantly higher than AB-113,
AB-147, and NB-A, which may be due to influence of their size and
charge of dyes.

2.2 Impact of Adsorbent Dose
The effects
of different adsorbent dosages were studied to examine cost effectiveness.
As displayed in Figure 6, it is obvious that the adsorption percentage of MO increases from
54.22 to 96.79, 71.47 to 97.84, and 77.31 to 98.89% with respect to
2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL doses respectively, increasing from 0.01 to 0.06
g on a 100 mg/L MO solution with a short contact time of 24 min. However,
there is only a minor change of MO adsorption percentage when the
2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL dosage was above 0.05 g. This may be due to low
adsorbent dosage, leading to the dispersal of 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL
into the aqueous solution; therefore, all adsorbent surface sites
were completely exposed, which eases the adsorption capability of
MO. In this process, the adsorbent surface sites are saturated quickly,
leading to high adsorption capacity. Therefore, the optimum adsorbent
dose is kept at 0.05 g for further detailed adsorption studies.

Figure 6 Impact of adsorbent
dose on the MO adsorption for various FPL adsorbents
in an aqueous solution (initial MO concentration, 100 mg/L; adsorbent
dose, 0.01 to 0.06 g; adsorption time, 24 min; temperature, 30 °C).

2.3 Impact of Contact Time
and Initial Dye Concentration
Two initial MO concentrations
of 100 and 1000 mg/L were chosen
to study the impact of contact time and initial concentration for
adsorption of MO on 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL. As shown in Figure 7, at a lower MO concentration,
the adsorption rate is dependent on time along with very fast kinetics
with an adsorption percentage of 87.54 (5 min), 91.07 (4 min), and
95.01% (1 min) for 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL, respectively. Subsequently,
in the extended contact time, the adsorption rate became moderate,
and the equilibrium was reached quickly at around 9, 7, and 2 min
for 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL, respectively. At a higher initial concentration
of MO dye (1000 mg/L), the adsorption rate was also based on time
and moderately fast at initial interval with adsorption percentages
of 75.58 (7 min), 81.27 (5 min), and 83.00% (4 min) for 2FPL, 4FPL,
and 6FPL, respectively (Figure 7b). Thereafter, during the prolonged contact time, the adsorption
rate became slow, and equilibrium was reached at about 16, 14, and
10 min for 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL, respectively.

Figure 7 Impact of contact time
on MO adsorption of 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL
at two different adsorbate concentrations of (a) 100 mg/L (inset figure,
before (I) and after (II) adsorption of MO) and (b) 1000 mg/L. (c)
Effect of the initial MO concentration on 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL (adsorbent
dose, 0.05 g; contact time, 24 min; temperature, 30 °C).

In lower and higher concentrations, the faster
adsorption rate
of MO on 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL is attributed to the interactions between
MO with active sites of FPL, fast exchange of anions (NO3–) by MO in interlayers of MAN-LDH, larger surface
area, and strong electrostatic interaction between MO and FPL. Moreover,
the adsorption rate of 6FPL is much quicker than 2FPL and 4FPL, which
is due to the higher molecular weight of PEG that plays a vital part
in achieving a higher adsorption capacity and rate. As the molecular
weight of PEG increases, the distance between the PEG and surface
of the MAN-LDH layer also increases, which in turn results in more
active sites in 6FPL. Thus, the equilibrium of adsorption capacity
was reached within a short time interval. This is the most excellent
parameter satisfying the application of 6FPL on large scale wastewater
management units. The short adsorption rate suggests that additional
treatment batches can be managed in every time interval and also the
number of wastewater management units may be reduced.

The initial
dye concentration of MO ranging from 100 to 2000 mg/L
was used for an adsorption batch investigation, and the results are
displayed in Figure 7c. The increase in the initial MO concentration leads to the decrease
in adsorption percentage. At high concentrations, the quantity of
MO is more than that of available adsorption sites. In contrast, at
low concentrations, the quantity of MO is less than that of the available
adsorption sites, which leads to a higher adsorption percentage of
MO. The percentage adsorption of MO was decreased from 96.07 to 69.89,
98.70 to 78.02, and 99.63 to 78.36% with an increase in the initial
MO concentration from 100 to 2000 mg/L for 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL, respectively
at a 24 min contact time.

2.4 Adsorption Kinetics
A second-order
kinetic model40 was used to investigate
the adsorption rate and mechanism of 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL for MO.
The linearized format of the rate equation, eq SE1, and its details are presented in the Supporting Information.

The kinetic constants are determined from the linear plot of eq SE1. The calculated values of the pseudo-second-order
kinetic parameters and correlation coefficients (R2) are given in Table S3, and
the linear plots of pseudo-second-order kinetic model obtained are
shown in Figure S8. As stated in Table S3, all values of correlation coefficients
(R2) achieved by the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model were closer to one (0.99) for 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL at
different initial dye concentrations. The determined qcal values by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model are
very close to the experimental values (qexp). The rate constant value of k2 decreases
with an increase in the initial dye concentration from 100 to 2000
mg/L. These observations explain a strong interaction between FPL
and MO similar to the earlier literature.41,42

2.5 Effect of pH
Effect of pH on MO adsorption
of 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL was investigated in the pH range of 3 to 10.
As displayed in Figure S9, adsorption performances
of all three adsorbents are in the same range of pH. The percentage
of MO adsorption by 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL altered from 87.65 to 88.19,
90.82 to 94.04 and 92.37 to 96.67%, respectively with respect to pH
ranges from 3 to 10. There were only minor changes of adsorption percentage
in the pH range of 4 to 8. All three adsorbents show a higher percentage
of MO adsorption at the natural pH (pH = 6.8). In less than pH 4,
there were moderate changes in the MO adsorption percentage. In acidic
pH, dissolution occurs in the magnetic layered nanocomposite adsorbents.
However, in the alkaline medium, there is an increase in the amount
of hydroxide ions, which in turn leads to a decrease in the percentage
of MO adsorption. The electrostatic attraction between the positively
charged adsorbent surface layer and the anionic adsorbate leads to
higher adsorption of MO on 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL. Investigation of
pH impact on adsorption percentage values revealed the electrostatic
interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate.25,43

2.6 Effect of Temperature
Temperature
is an essential physicochemical study factor, as the adsorption capacity
of the adsorbent may vary with changes in temperature. Generally,
thermodynamic investigations are carried out at different temperatures
to analyze the data. Adsorption studies were carried out at five different
temperatures (288.15, 298.15, 308.15, 318.15, and 328.15 K) to determine
the thermodynamics parameters such as standard enthalpy (ΔH), standard entropy (ΔS), and standard
free energy (ΔG) using eqs SE2 and SE3.

The linear plots of lnKo versus 1/T are shown in Figure S10. All thermodynamics parameters are calculated and presented in Table 1. The positive ΔS value confirms the greater attraction of MO toward FPL
during the adsorption process. The positive ΔH value indicates that this adsorption system was endothermic. The
negative ΔG value confirms that the adsorption
of the adsorbate on the adsorbent was spontaneous and thermodynamically
feasible at higher temperatures. The thermodynamic parameters confirm
that the FPL could be a potential adsorbent for the adsorption of
MO from aqueous solutions.42

Figure S11 shows the adsorption behavior
of 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL with a 1000 mg/L MO solution and a 24 min
time interval. The adsorption capacity increases with the increase
in temperature from 15 to 55 °C, and it represents the endothermic
nature of MO adsorption. The adsorption capacity of MO at 2 min on
2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL are found to be 414.73, 454.48, and 481.49 mg/g,
respectively (55 °C). The results exhibit that the temperature
aids for strong interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent. The synthesized
magnetic layered nanocomposites could be a favorable material for
the excellent removal of MO from aqueous solutions.42

2.7 Impact of Ionic Strength
The ionic
strength is one of the parameters that have an effect on the hydrophobic
and electrostatic interaction between anionic dyes and adsorbent surface
sites. Figure 8 displays
the effect of NaCl concentration on the adsorption percentage and
capacity of MO. As the NaCl concentration increases from 0.1 to 0.8
M, the adsorption capacity and percentage adsorption for 6FPL decreases
from 47.61 to 20.69 mg/g and 94.91 to 31.69%, respectively at a 2
min contact time. These results confirm the electrostatic interactions
operative between MO and FPL. The other adsorbents also followed the
same pattern on increasing the ionic strength.

on MO removal by 6FPL (initial MO
concentration, 100 mg/L; adsorbent dose = 0.05 g; contact time, 2
min; temperature, 30 °C).

2.8 Adsorption Isotherm
The adsorption
isotherm reveals the adsorption performance of MO on the surface of
2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL magnetic layered nanocomposites. The experimental
data were fitted by two isotherm models Langmuir44 and Freundlich.45 These isotherm
equations are conveyed as eqs SE4 and SE5 in the Supporting Information.

The adsorption isotherm of
MO onto the 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL adsorbents was achieved by varying
the initial dye concentration from 100 to 2000 mg/L, as shown in Figure 9. The equilibrium
adsorption capacity increases with the increase in the initial MO
concentration for 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL. The adsorption capacity of
6FPL is considerably higher than 4FPL and 2FPL. The equilibrium adsorption
capacity values are 682.09, 761.38, and 764.70 mg/g at the equilibrium
concentrations of 588.67, 429.57, and 428.98 mg/L, respectively.

Figure 9 MO uptake
per gram of 6FPL, 4FPL, and 2FPL adsorbents (initial
MO concentration, 0–2000 mg/L; adsorbent dose, 0.05 g; contact
time, 24 min; temperature, 30 °C).

The values of isotherm constants for the two isotherm models were
calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of the
two isotherm equations, eqs SE4 and SE5. The values of adsorption isotherm constants and correlation coefficients
are given in Table 2. The linearized plots of the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models
are presented in Figure S12. As indicated
in Table 2, the acquired
values of R2 of 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL for
the Langmuir isotherm were close to 1 and show a better fit than that
of Freundlich isotherms. The data of the Langmuir constant Vm demonstrates the monolayer adsorption capacity
for 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL that are close to the experimental values.
The calculated monolayer adsorption capacities of MO on the 2FPL,
4FPL, and 6FPL are 775.19, 826.44, and 833.33 mg/g, respectively.37,43

The lower values of the Langmuir constant bL, expressive of the adsorption bond energy,
indicate the physical
characteristics of the adsorption of MO on 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL. The
Freundlich constant values of n greater than one
denote the better adsorption characteristics of the 6FPL, 4FPL, and
2FPL in the adsorption of MO. The values of correlation coefficients
(R2) show fitness of the Langmuir isotherm
model for the existing adsorbent–adsorbate model. Therefore,
the Langmuir isotherm model can be regarded as the best model for
MO adsorption on 6FPL, 4FPL, and 2FPL.

The adsorption capacity
values of 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL magnetic
layered nanocomposites are compared with other adsorbents as reported
in the literature and presented in Table S4. In this table, the experimental adsorption capacity, calculated
adsorption capacity from Langmuir adsorption model, adsorption contact
time, adsorbent dose, reusability cycle, or number of reused cycles
are compared. From this data, it is very clear that the adsorbents
used in this study are found to have greater adsorption capacity in
the removal of effluents from wastewater within a short interval of
time.42,46−56

2.9 Mechanism of MO Uptake by the 6FPL Adsorbent
To know the adsorption mechanism for removal of MO using 6FPL magnetic
layered nanocomposites, XRD and FTIR studies were carried out for
6FPL, 4FPL, and 2FPL before and after adsorption of MO and are shown
in Figure 10.

Figure 10 (a) XRD patterns
of 6FPL, 4FPL, and 2FPL before and after adsorption
(b) FT-IR spectra of 6FPL before and after MO adsorption.

The XRD patterns of the MO-adsorbed 6FPL, 4FPL, and 2FPL
were recorded
and compared with that of the free 6FPL, 4FPL, and 2FPL (Figure 10a). The harmonic
peak observed at 11.5° (0.769 nm, d003 space) in all three FPL adsorbents corresponds to characteristics
of MAN-LDH with the nitrate interlayer ions. The XRD patterns of MO-adsorbed
6FPL, 4FPL, and 2FPL show new peaks due to the 003 diffraction plane
that corresponds to nitrate ion replacement by MO molecules at 2θ
positions 10.08° (0.880 nm), 11.16° (0.792 nm), and 11.21°
(0.785 nm), respectively.42 The enlargement
in the d-space value after adsorption shows an intercalation
of MO within the magnetic layered nanocomposites of MAN-LDH. The increased d003 spacing is in the order of 6FPL > 4FPL
>
2FPL, which confirms that more MO molecules are adsorbed into the
interlayers of LDH in 6FPL.42

The
FT-IR spectra of MO-adsorbed 6FPL, free 6FPL, and MO are compared
in Figure 10b. The
intense and broad absorption band between 3800 and 2900 cm–1 in the spectra of 6FPL and MO-adsorbed 6FPL are due to stretching
vibrations of hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups in the magnetic layered
nanocomposites. The FT-IR spectrum of 6FPL shows a broad peak at 1382.72
cm–1 due to antisymmetric stretching vibration of
intercalated nitrate ions in the interlayer space. In contrast, the
spectrum of MO-adsorbed 6FPL shows a sharp peak at 1381.46 cm–1. This difference is due to the replacement of nitrate
ions by MO. The moderate sharp peak between 1609–1630 cm–1 is due to the O–H bending vibration of the
interlayer water molecules. The 6FPL displays peak at 2889, 1040,
and 1220 cm–1 that are characteristic bending vibration
peaks of C–O–H and symmetric stretching vibration of
the C–H group of PEG. The sharp broad peak at 650 cm–1 is due to the metal oxides of Fe, Mg, and Al. The MO spectra shows
characteristic absorption bands of MO at 1612 and 1514 cm–1 for the aromatic C=C and the azo group (−N=N−),
respectively. The absorption bands due to the benzene group can be
seen at 1125 cm–1. The above mentioned MO peaks
are present in MO-adsorbed 6FPL. This observation confirms the MO
adsorption uptake process.42

2.10 Reusability and Regenerative Studies
Reusability of
the adsorbents is a significant factor in continuous
batch adsorption studies. The reusability studies of adsorbents are
shown in Figure 11. For the reusability cycle, 0.05 g of every adsorbent was shaken
for 24 min in 25 mL of 100 mg/L of the MO solution. After each adsorption
cycle, the adsorbent was regenerated by washing three times with DD
water and ethanol. The amount of MO adsorbed by the magnetic layered
nanocomposites was determined by measuring the absorbance of unabsorbed
MO at 463 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. It is clearly
observed from Figure 11 that the recycled adsorbent after desorption shows gradual decrease
in efficiency in further cycles. The MO adsorption decreases from
100 to 80% for all three adsorbents in cycles 0–6. After that,
the percentage adsorption was gradually decreased for further cycles.

Figure 11 Reusability
studies of 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL toward MO adsorption
in an aqueous solution (initial MO concentration, 100 mg/L; adsorbents
dose = 0.05 g; adsorption time, 24 min; temperature, 30 °C).

Compared to 2FPL and 4FPL, 6FPL has more reusable
capacity (Figure 12a) due to the presence
of the high molecular weight PEG. 6FPL gives moderate results up to
30 cycles of reusability, after which it attains the saturation level.
The recycled nanocomposites after the 31st cycle were separated
into four parts. The first part of the 6FPL was recoated with MAN-LDH,
the second part of the 6FPL was washed with 0.1 N HCl, the third part
of the 6FPL was washed with 0.1 N NaOH, and the fourth part of the
6FPL was washed with both 0.1 N HCl and 0.1 N NaOH. Further, the adsorption
studies were carried out with four separated parts of recycled 6FPL
in 100 mg/L MO, and their results are presented in Figure 12b. The 0.1 N HCl, NaOH, and
both HCl and NaOH washed 6FPL showed 61.79, 51.63, and 39.38% adsorption
of MO. The MAN-LDH recoated 6FPL resulted in 99.37% of adsorption
as similar to the freshly prepared 6FPL. Thus, an innovative technique
to reuse FPL has been found out. It can be concluded that 6FPL can
be used repeatedly with negligible loss in their adsorption capacity
for MO.

3 Conclusions
In this study, magnetic adsorbent
FPL’s with different molecular
weights of PEG were synthesized and characterized. The morphology
of the synthesized magnetic layered nanocomposites and their adsorption
performance with MO were investigated. It was confirmed that the morphologies
of nanocomposites significantly influenced their adsorption capacity.
The results show that all three adsorbents exhibit excellent adsorption
performance within a short time interval of 5 min. There is a remarkable
high adsorption capacity and easy separation of adsorbents with a
magnet after the adsorption process was achieved. The kinetics of
2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL were well defined by the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model. Isotherm investigations elucidated that the adsorption
of MO on 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL was better described by the Langmuir
model of monolayer adsorption. Among the three adsorbents, 6FPL shows
a higher adsorption capacity with a value of 833.33 mg/g. The thermodynamic
data suggests that the adsorption of MO on FPL is endothermic in nature.
The adsorption process has been found to be spontaneous and thermodynamically
feasible for FPL and MO. The reusability of FPL is quite excellent
for MO adsorption. The high adsorption capacity of the 6FPL revealed
its potential as an effective adsorbent in wastewater treatment plants.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents
The chemicals
were of analytical
reagent grade and used without further purification. FeCl3·6H2O, FeCl2·4H2O, and
urea were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Al(NO3)3·6H2O, Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, NaOH, and ethylene glycol were purchased from Merck. Polyethylene
glycols (PEG) with different molecular weights (1.5, 2.0, 4.0, and
6.0 k) were purchased from Loba Chemie. Methyl orange, acid blue 113,
acid blue 147, and Nile blue A were purchased from Alfa Aesar. The
stock solution for all the experiments was prepared using double distilled
(DD) water.

4.2 Synthesis of the Adsorbents
4.2.1 Synthesis of PEG Modified Fe3O4 (FP)
The PEG-modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles were
prepared via the hydrothermal method.
Synthesis of PEG-modified Fe3O4 was carried
out by the following procedure. A total of 0.06 N of FeCl3·6H2O was entirely dissolved in 60 mL of ethylene
glycol for the formation of a homogeneous solution under active stirring.
Subsequently, 1 mL of 1.5 k PEG, 0.6 N of urea, and 10 mL of DD water
were added to the above solution. The mixture was kept under continuous
stirring until the solution become clear, and after that, it was transferred
into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. It was heated
at 205 °C for 10 h and then cooled to room temperature. The magnetic
nanoparticles were separated using magnets, washed with DD water and
ethanol to remove organic and inorganic impurities, and then dried
in a hot air oven at 80 °C for 10 h. The dried magnetic nanoparticles
were thereafter denoted as 1.5FP. A similar protocol was followed
for synthesizing 2FP, 4FP, and 6FP with respective molecular weight
PEG.

4.2.2 Deposit of MAN-LDH over PEG-Modified Fe3O4 (FPL)
Fe3O4-PEG-MAN-LDH
(FPL) magnetic layered nanocomposites were developed via a simple
chemical precipitation method. A total of 1.0 g of 1.5FP was dispelled
into 30 mL DD water for 15 min and later transferred into a 500 mL
beaker at 60 °C in a magnetic thermostat with constant stirring.
The molar ratio of 3:1 Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and Al(NO3)3·6H2O
mixed metal precursor solution was co-precipitated over the 1.5FP
dispersed medium. Subsequently, a 2 N NaOH solution was added drop-wise
to the above solution with constant stirring until the solution pH
of 10 ± 0.2 at 60 °C. The above mixture was aged for 15
h under continuous stirring at room temperature. The resultant grey
magnetic layered nanocomposites precipitate was easily separated by
magnet. It was systematically washed with DD water to take away any
extra alkalinity and impurities. Washed magnetic layered nanocomposites
were dried at 80 °C for 10 h and then powdered. The magnetic
layered nanocomposites are thereafter represented as 1.5FPL. The same
protocol was followed for synthesizing 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL. A brief
schematic illustration is shown in Scheme 1.

4.3 Characterization Techniques
Powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed with a Phillips powder diffractometer,
X’Pert MPD, with Cu Kα (λ = 1.540589° A) radiation
in the 2θ range of 2–80°. The Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectral analysis of the adsorbents was performed
in an Equinox 55 Bruker with the ATR method over a wavenumber region
of 400–4000 cm–1. The thermal analysis (TA)
of the adsorbents was executed with a Q50 from TA Instruments of thermogravimetric
analyzer under air in the temperature range of 25–800 °C
and the heating rate of 20 °C/min. The morphological investigation
of the adsorbents were performed with a field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) using JEOL, JSM-6701F field emission instrument
at the electron source of cold field emission (<310> W crystal),
with an accelerating voltage variable from 0.5 to 30 kV, magnification
variable from ×25 to ×650,000, and working distance of 10
mm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using
Tecnai F20 (FEI Company) at 200 kV.

The amount of iron, magnesium,
and aluminum metal ions present in MAN-LDH, 2FPL, 4FPL, and 6FPL were
quantified by using ICP-OES (Perkin-Elmer Optima 5300 DV spectrometer).
About 5 mg of the sample is digested in 5 mL of concentrated hydrochloric
acid (HCl) overnight. Then, 45 mL of deionized water is added to the
solution for dilution. The resulting solutions were filtered and directly
used for measurement. During the analysis, the HCl mixture was used
as the reagent blank, and a calibration plot was made using high-purity
ICP standards. The specific surface areas of the adsorbents were measured
with a Quantachrome Instruments (Version 5.0) by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method using the nitrogen adsorption–desorption technique
at 77 K. The magnetic properties of the adsorbents were assessed by
JDM-13 vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM).

4.4 Adsorption
Studies
The MO dye was
used for FPL adsorption investigation. In the batch adsorption study,
a 25 mL dye solution of diverse concentrations and the needed quantity
of adsorbents were taken in a 100 mL stopper glass conical flask shaken
at 200 rpm up to a predefined contact time at 30 °C. At the end
of the adsorption test, the adsorbent was isolated from the dye solution
using an external magnet, and the remaining dye concentrations were
found out from the absorbance value measured at 483 nm using a Cary
100 UV–vis spectrophotometer.

The percentage adsorption
was calculated using the formula  

The adsorption capacity was calculated
using the formula  where C0 is the
initial MO concentration, Ce is the equilibrium
MO concentration (mg/L), qe is the amount
of MO adsorbed per unit gram of the adsorbent at equilibrium, v is the volume of the MO solution (L), and w is the weight of the adsorbent (g).

The impacts of the adsorption
efficiency of three adsorbents were
studied with an MO concentration of 100 mg/L in a 25 mL solution.
To investigate the impact of the quantity of adsorbent on the adsorption
capacity, a sequence of adsorption studies were performed by varying
the mass of adsorbent from 0.01 to 0.06 g in a 25 mL dye solution,
which were kept in a shaker for 24 min at 30 °C. For investigations,
the adsorption rates were tested on a time interval of 0–24
min with an initial MO concentration of 100–2000 mg/L at predefined
time intervals. The adsorption isotherms were tested with a series
of initial MO concentrations from 100 to 2000 mg/L at 30 °C.
The impact of temperature was studied at five different temperatures
(283.15, 298.15, 308.15, 318.15, and 328.15 K) with a 1000 mg/L initial
MO concentration and a time interval of 0–2 min contact time.
The impact of ionic strength was studied at five different NaCl concentrations
from 0.1 to 0.8 N, and the initial MO concentration was 100 mg/L with
a contact time of 2 min at 30 °C. To investigate the impact of
pH on the adsorption competency, adsorption tests were performed with
25 mL of a 100 ppm MO dye solution at various pH values (3–12)
with 0.05 g of the adsorbent. To ascertain reusability of 2FPL, 4FPL,
and 6FPL, the utilized FPL’s were cleaned with DD water and
ethanol for three times, and then dried at 80 °C in a hot air
oven for 2 h before further use.
