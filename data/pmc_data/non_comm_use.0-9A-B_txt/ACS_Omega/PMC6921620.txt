Three sunflower head pectin (SFHP) with different molecular weights
(Mw = 4.50, 97.23, and 254.64 kDa) were
obtained by enzyme-assisted extraction and characterized by FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The corrosion inhibition of mild steel
in 1 M HCl solution was evaluated by the weight loss measurement.
The inhibition efficiency (IE%) increased as its concentration increases
and decreased as the temperature increases. The SFHP with the lowest Mw of 4.50 kDa exhibited an IEmax of
92.05% at the medium concentration (2.0 g L–1).
The inhibition properties of SFHP (Mw =
4.50 kDa) were investigated electrochemically and theoretically. The
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that the charge-transfer
resistance increased as its concentration increases, the double-layer
capacitance decreased as concentration increases, and the IE% also
increased as concentration increases. The potentiodynamic polarization
(PP) revealed that the SFHP acted as mixed-type inhibitor. The IE%
reached 90.3% at the medium concentration (2.0 g L–1) of SHFP. The three-dimensional super depth digital microscopy and
scanning electron microscopy tests confirmed the formation of inhibitor
films on the surface of mild steel. The adsorption of SFHP on the
mild steel surface was proved to obey the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.
The theoretical studies via density functional theory and molecular
dynamics simulation further revealed the mechanism of corrosion inhibition.

1 Introduction
The use of inhibitors is recognized as one of the most economical
and effective methods to defend metals against corrosion.1,2 Many kinds of organic and inorganic compounds have been tested and
applied as inhibitors to protect metals in industrial settings.3,4 Despite their high performance, most of them are toxic, biorefractory,
and expensive. During these years, in the context of environmental
pollution, the choice of corrosion inhibitors should not only consider
application efficiency issues but also, more importantly, environmental
friendliness. In searching for highly efficient, readily available,
relatively cheap, and eco-friendly inhibitors, numerous experimental
studies have been undertaken on plant extractions and biomaterials
as metal corrosion inhibitors in corrosive solution. Plant part extracts
and organic components extracted from various plant parts acted as
effective inhibitors,5,6 such as pomegranate peel crude
extract,7Ircinia strobilina crude extract,8 sapota leaf extract,9 and Lagerstroemia speciosa leaf extract.10 However, corrosion researchers
are committed to know the inhibitory active ingredients of plant extract
inhibitors and performing separation and extraction. Organic sugars,
flavonoids,11 polyphenols, alkaloids,12 and tannins can interact with a metal surface
and obstruct corrosion active site. Most recent studies are therefore
focused on the isolation of the active components responsible for
the corrosion inhibition performance of plant extracts.

Pectin, a type of polysaccharide polymer, originates from natural
plants. It is widely used in the food industry as a food additive.13 Recently, because of its nontoxicity, biodegradability,
and suitable molecular structure, it has attracted great interest
as a corrosion inhibitor. Pectin extracted from citrus peel14 was used to inhibit aluminum corrosion in HCl
solution. The IEmax obtained at 10 °C using 8.0 g
L–1 concentration was about 91%, whereas it declined
to 31% at 40 °C.15 The citrus peel
pectin also was used as a corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in 1
M HCl solution, and the IEmax obtained at 25 °C using
2.0 g L–1 concentration was about 89%.16 Pectin extracted from apple pomace acted as
an inhibitor for X60 pipeline steel at 25 °C in 0.5 M HCl solution,
and the IEmax reached 77% using 1.0 g L–1 concentration.17Opuntia cladodes’ pectin exhibited an inhibition efficiency higher
than 87% at the concentration between 0.125 and 1 g L–1 at 25 °C.18 The pectin was isolated
from tomato peel waste and acted as a corrosion inhibitor for tin
in 2% NaCl, 0.5% citric acid solution, and 1% acetic acid solution,
and the IEmax obtained at 25 °C using 4.0 g L–1 concentration was about 73%.19 Using the same conditions, the IEmax of apple pectin
for tin was 60% at the concentration of 4.0 g L–1. These preliminary results have shown that pectin alone is a promising
green corrosion inhibitor for metals in different corrosive media.
The raw material resource, extraction conditions, and application
conditions affected its inhibition performance. However, the relationship
between the plant extraction structure and inhibition performance
was not studied. The pectin corrosion inhibition properties should
depend on its Mw and degree of esterification
(DE). Furthermore, the specific inhibition mechanism of pectin as
a natural polymer was not proposed.

Thus, in this work, we focused on the SFHP, a low-ester pectin
that was different from other pectin, and it was the first time using
it as a corrosion inhibitor for carbon steel. The sunflower heads (a by-product of oil crop production) were selected
as raw materials, and the pectin was obtained from sunflower heads
by enzyme-assisted extraction, which achieved recycling of waste resources.
Three SFHP with different molecular weights (Mw = 4.50, 97.23, and 254.64 kDa) were first obtained by controlling
different enzyme extraction conditions, and for the first time, they
acted as corrosion inhibitors for mild steel in 1 M HCl solution.
Three SFHP were characterized by FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. The corrosion
inhibition performance of the three SHFP with different Mw was studied by weight loss measurement, and the corrosion
inhibition performance and the corrosion inhibition mechanism of the
SFHP (Mw = 4.50 kDa) with the best corrosion
inhibition effect were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS), potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), surface analysis, and theoretical
studies.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of SHFP
SHFP contains
large amount of poly(d-galacturonic acid) bonded via α-1,4-glycosidic
linkage (Figure 1),
and the structure was characterized by FTIR (Figure 2) and 1H NMR (Figure 3) spectroscopy.

Figure 1 Molecular structure of SHFP.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of SHFP.

Figure 3 1H NMR spectrum of SHFP.

FTIR spectra of SHFP are shown in Figure 2. A strong absorption, at about 3433 cm–1, was due to the stretching vibration of hydroxyl
groups. Formation of the inter and intramolecular hydrogen bonding
of the galacturonic acid backbone might be the cause of this observation.
Besides, the carbonyl bands, from 1706 to 1735 cm–1 and 637 to 1607 cm–1, represented the esterified
and free carboxyl groups, respectively. The “finger print”
region, between 1300 and 800 cm–1, clearly demonstrated
certain variations of pectin monosaccharide composition.20 The peaks in the region of 1010–1100
cm–1 corresponded to the α-glycoside bonds
and β-glycoside bonds absorption. The DE was calculated as the
peak area at 1713 cm–1 (COOCH3) over
the sum of the peak areas of 1641 cm–1 (COOH) and
1713 cm–1 (COOCH3);21 the obtained values of DE were 41.14, 40.24, and 30.14%.

The 1H NMR spectrum of SHFP is presented in Figure 3 Signals around δ4.96,
3.68, 3.90, 4.34, and 5.08 were assigned to H-1, H-2, H-3, H-4, and
H-5 of GalA units. The signal of methyl group (−OCH3) linked to the carboxyl groups (galacturonic acid) appeared at 3.68
ppm. The peaks at 2.10 and 1.96 ppm were due to acetyl groups with
2-O- and 3-O-galacturonic acid.

2.2 Weight Loss Measurements
Three samples
with different Mw values (154.65, 97.23,
and 4.50 kDa) were tested as corrosion inhibitors for carbon steel
in 1 M HCl solution, and the results are displayed in Figure 4 and Table 1. It could be observed that the IEw% of the three SFHP samples increased with decreasing Mw, and the IEw% of the three SFHP samples were
ranked in the following order: 154.65 kDa < 97.23 kDa < 4.50
kDa. All of the
IEw% values for SFHP with Mw = 154.64 kDa were lower than 50%, even displaying no anticorrosive
activity at all at 25 and 30 °C. However, for SFHP with Mw = 4.50 kDa, all the IEw% values
were higher than 50% at all tested temperatures. Such significant
differences may be caused by the solubility of SFHP in the HCl solution.
An effective inhibitor must have adequate solubility in the corrosive
medium.22 Pectin molecules with higher Mw were more entangled and therefore had lower
solubility and IEw% in HCl solution. On the other hand,
SFHP with lower Mw was more feasible,
less entangled, and more uncoiled so better solubilities and IEw% were obtained.15 Depending on
the DE, the pectins were classified into low-methoxyl pectin (LMP,
DE < 50%) and high-methoxyl pectin (HMP, DE > 50%). It was found
that SFHP (DE = 40.24%) with Mw = 97.23
kDa was a poor inhibitor in 1 M HCl solution, but citrus peel pectin
(DE = 60%, Mw = 30–100 kDa) was
a good inhibitor.14 The original experiment
by Fares et al. was conducted with aluminum.15 To eliminate the effect of the metal type, we performed corrosion
experiments with C-steel using citrus peel pectin. The maximum IEw% of 5.0 g L–1 citrus peel pectin in 1 M
HCl for C-steel at 15 °C was 87.65%. The results showed that
citrus peel pectin (HMP) achieved a higher IEw% than SFHP
(LMP) of similar Mw. This may be related
to the DE of the pectin. −COOH functional groups in the pectin
molecules were easily protonated into −COOH2+ in highly acidic solutions. The repelling force among these positive
charges stretches out the pectin molecule; hence, pectin molecules
with higher Mw became easily entangled.
In the same Mw range, LMP, which has more
−COOH2+ groups, was also more prone to entanglement
and was less soluble than HMP. Therefore, reducing the molecular weight
of LMP was an effective way to increase its solubility and IEw%. However, lowering Mw did not
always increase IEw%. Galacturonic acid, which was the
basic unit of pectin, was also tested and found to be ineffective
in inhibiting C-steel corrosion. This was likely because this molecule
was too small to form a compact protective film. Hence, pectin as
a high-performance corrosion inhibitor needs to be of an appropriate Mw.

Figure 4 IEw% versus SFHP concentration for SFHP of different
molecular weights at different temperatures.

Figure 4 shows that
the pectin concentration and test temperature also had an effect on
its IEw%. The IEw% decreased with increasing
temperature at constant concentrations. In acidic solutions, carbon
steel corrosion was regularly accompanied by the production of hydrogen,
which agitated the solution. The higher temperature accelerated the
thermal motion of H2 and inhibitors, causing the inhibitor
molecules to easily detach from the carbon steel surface and increase
the surface roughness. Hence, the IEw% decreased with increasing
temperature. IEw% increased significantly with increasing
concentration, especially in the lower concentration range (0.1–1.0
g L–1). Inhibitors slowed metal corrosion by adsorbing
onto the metal surface. At lower concentrations, all SFHP molecules
in the solution were adsorbed onto the metal surface, leading to the
approximately linear growth of IEw% with the pectin concentration.
At higher concentrations, however, adsorption saturation caused this
correlation to become weaker since some pectin molecules were not
utilized for inhibition.

2.3 Electrochemical Measurements of SFHP with Mw = 4.50 kDa
2.3.1 Open Circuit Potential
It is necessary
to ensure that there is a stable potential on the electrode surface
before performing PDP and EIS tests. The OCP (vs SCE) versus time
plots for the steel/blank solution interface at (25 ± 1) °C
are shown in Figure 5. From Figure 5, the
OCP value in the blank solution increased to nearly −0.167
V (vs SCE) after 600 s, which remained constant in the rest of the
time. The corrosion inhibition system with different SHFP concentrations
takes different times to obtain a stable OCP value, and the OCP value
of the blank solution was lower than it. This phenomenon may be attributed
to the SFHP that adsorb on the carbon steel surface and replaced chloride
ions. The experimental
results showed that a stable open-circuit potential can be obtained
in 30 min, and then EIS and PDP tests were performed sequentially
under this condition.

Figure 5 Open-circuit potential versus time plots in 1 M HCl with various
concentrations of SFHP.

2.3.2 Potentiodynamic Polarization Curve
Due to its electrochemical inhomogeneity, the surface of carbon steel
in HCl contained large numbers of microanodes and microcathodes, leading
to short-circuiting of the microbattery reaction on the C-steel surface
during corrosion. Hence, it was crucial to examine the anticorrosive
activity of the inhibitor for both the anode and the cathode. Potentiodynamic
polarization curves were used to obtain such information, and the
test results are shown in Figure 6. Some of the polarization parameters obtained from
these curves are listed in Table 2. The corresponding inhibition efficiency (IEp%) of SFHP can be calculated as23 1  where Icorr and Icorr-0 are the
corrosion current densities of carbon steel with and without SFHP,
respectively.

various concentrations of SFHP.

5.00	–0.217	101	–0.198	0.084	–0.424	312.01	91.79	
According to the polarization curves, an increased amount of SFHP
reduced the current densities, and the reduction was more significant
in the cathodic branch than in the anodic branch. Furthermore, the
corrosion potential was notably moved in the cathodic direction as
SFHP was added to the HCl solution, with the maximum shift of Ecorr being +53 mV. These results suggested that
SFHP acted as a mixed-type inhibitor with predominant control of the
cathodic reaction.24 Organic corrosion
inhibitors can be classified into three categories according to their
modes of action, each with distinct corrosion potential changes as
the inhibitor is added to the medium. No noticeable changes in Ecorr and fa/fc = 1 were considered as signs of geometric
blocking. The other two types, active site blocking and electrocatalytic
inhibition, would cause obvious changes in Ecorr and fa/fc ≠ 1 (fa < 1 and fc < 1 in the former, fa > 1 or fc > 1 in the latter).
The results in Table 1 showed that SFHP inhibited the corrosion of C-steel by active site
blocking and that the SFHP molecules were preferentially adsorbed
at cathodic active sites on the metal surface. This finding also confirmed
that SFHP could effectively inhibit the corrosion of C-steel at Ecorr.

2.3.3 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
EIS was another valid means to explore the anticorrosive activity
of inhibitors on the metal/solution interface. The test results are
presented as Nyquist and Bode plots in Figure 7. A single capacitive loop implied that the
corrosion process was controlled by charge transfer. The Nyquist plots
for the corrosion of carbon steel retained their original shape with
the addition of the SHFP, revealing that the SHFP controlled the activity
of the corrosion reaction instead of altering the corrosion mechanism.
It can be seen that the corrosion rate decreased due to the presence
of SHFP in the corrosion solution, as indicated by the increased diameter
of the semicircle. The increased diameters of the semicircles indicated
that the diffusion process was strongly blocked by the inhibitors.

Figure 7 (a) Nyquist and (b) Bode plots of carbon steel in 1 M HCl solution
with various concentrations of SFHP.

From the Bode plots in Figure 7b, the peak heights increased with the concentration
of the SHFP, which indicated that a protective film formed on the
C-steel surface. The value of low-frequency impedance increased with
the concentration increase.25 The change
in microstructure at the interface of the metal solution might result
in a shift of phase angle because a protective film would form onto
the surface of the mild steel. Hence, with the increase in surface
coverage, the phase shift would also increase. The SFHP formed a denser
adsorption film on the surface of C-steel, which showed higher inhibition
efficiency with the concentration increases.

Corresponding equivalent circuits applied to analyze the impedance
spectra are shown in Figure 8, and the fitted impedance parameters are listed in Table 3. Usually, the double-layer
capacitance (Cdl) in the circuit would
be replaced by a constant phase element (CPE) due to the frequency
dispersion effect. The impedance of CPE was expressed as 2  where Q is
the CPE constant, , and ω represents the angular frequency
(rad s–1) of the sine wave modulation. The index n is used to measure the surface inhomogeneity of the electrode.
If n = 1, the CPE is reduced to an ideal capacitor26. The double-layer capacitance can be obtained as follows 3

1 M HCl (a) without and (b) with SFHP.

The corresponding inhibition efficiency, IEz%, is given
by 4  where (Rs + Rf + Rct) and Rct0 are the resistances
of charge transfer with and without SFHP, respectively. According
to Table 3, IEz% increased with C, a trend already observed
in the weight loss (IEw%) and Tafel polarization (IEp%) experiments.

Table 3 shows a
series of electrochemical parameters, including film resistance (Rf), film capacitance (Cf), charge-transfer
resistance (Rct), double-layer capacitance
(Cdl), solution resistance (Rs), constant phase element (CPE), and inhibition efficiency
(IEz). Rs and Rf values were quite small compared with Rct values, which illustrated that the corrosion process
was mainly controlled by the electron transfer between the metal surface
and the protective film. It can be seen that Rct increased with the increase in concentration, which confirmed
that the SHFP adsorption film improved the corrosion resistance of
C-steel. In addition, the decrease in Cdl value was probably attributed to the replacement of the previously
absorbed water molecules with large dielectric constants by the larger
SHFP molecules with lower dielectric constants. As a result, the inhibition
efficiency displayed an increasing trend with an increase in inhibitor
concentration, and the value reached 92.88% at a concentration of
5.00 g L–1.

2.4 Measurement of the Potential of Zero Charge
The thermodynamic parameters confirmed that the adsorption of SFHP
onto the surface of C-steel was physical adsorption, which was related
to the electrostatic attraction between the protonated SFHP and the
charged carbon steel surface. The potential of zero charge (Epzc) measurement was the most reliable method
to estimate the charge on a metal surface. The corresponding results
are shown in Figure 9. When the potential was −450 mV, the value of Cdl was at its minimum. This potential was assigned as
the Epzc of the C-steel in HCl solution
with 5.0 g L–1 SFHP (Mw = 4.50 kDa). Under the same conditions, the corrosion potential (−415
mV) was more positive than the Epzc, indicating
a positively charged metal surface in the corrosion-free environment.

in 1 M HCl solution with 5.0 g L–1 SFHP.

2.5 Adsorption Isotherms and Thermodynamic Analysis
SFHP, which contains oxygen atoms and carboxyl groups, inhibits
acid corrosion on the metal surface by forming a protective layer.
This layer can be formed by one of the following adsorption mechanisms:
(1) physisorption of SFHP on the steel surface due to the electrostatic
attraction between the protonated carboxyl groups of pectin and the
charged carbon steel surface; (2) chemisorption by forming coordinative
bonds between the empty d orbital of Fe and the lone pair electrons
of the O heteroatom; or (3) coexistence of the two adsorption modes
above. Adsorption isotherms (Langmuir, Temkin, Freundlich, and Frumkin
types) are often used to investigate the adsorption behavior and mechanism
of inhibitors. Similar to other reported pectin,30,31 the Langmuir isotherm of SFHP fitted the data better than the other
three kinds of isotherms mentioned above, with high regression coefficients
(R2) ranging from 0.94–0.99. According
to the Langmuir adsorption hypothesis, SFHP molecules adsorbed onto
the C-steel surface by monolayer adsorption and without interacting
with each other. The fitting plots are displayed in Figure 5. Changes in the standard free
energy (), enthalpy (), and entropy () of the adsorption process are important
thermodynamic parameters, and they are calculated by the following
equations26−28 5   6   7  where Kads is the adsorption equilibrium constant obtained from the
intercept in Figure 10.  was obtained as the slope of the linear
fit in the ln Kads versus 1/T plot (Figure 11). R is the gas constant, T is the temperature,
and B is a constant. All thermodynamic parameters are given in Table 4. Based on thermodynamic
principles,  < 0,  < 0, and  > 0 indicating that the adsorption process
was definitely spontaneous. Usually, an adsorption process was believed
to be physisorption if  < 20 kJ mol–1 and
chemisorption if  > 40 kJ mol-1.29,30 The values of  in Table 4 were approximately 20 kJ mol–1,
indicating that the adsorption of SFHP on the C-steel surface occurs
through physisorption. The values obtained for  led to the same conclusion. The adsorption
process was an exothermic reaction in which energy was released as
pectin was spontaneously adsorbed onto the metal surface. Physical
adsorption, due to its weak interaction force, was consistent with
small  (i.e.,  is rarely below −40 kJ mol–1). In contrast, chemisorption normally released much more energy
( < −100 kJ mol–1) due to the much stronger chemical bonds.31 The value of  in Table 4 (−6.23 kJ mol–1) also demonstrated
that the SFHP adsorption here was physical adsorption. This corresponded
to hypothesis (1) discussed in Section 2.5, and electrostatic attraction was the
main force between pectin and the carbon steel surface.

2.6 Surface Analysis
2.6.1 3D Super Depth Digital Microscopy Analysis
Figure 12 shows
digital microscopy photographs of carbon steel surfaces before and
after exposure to 1 M HCl solution for 48 h at 25 °C, with and
without 5.0 g L–1 SFHP (Mw = 4.50 kDa). While the pristine C-steel surface (Figure 12a) had a smooth texture, which
had an average depth of less than 11.04 μm after exposure to
blank HCl solution (Figure 12b), many irregular erosion gullies developed on the surface,
and the texture diminished due to corrosion by the acid solution,
resulting in an average depth value of about 78.98 μm. In contrast, the surface of the sample immersed in HCl with pectin
(Figure 12c) had only
a few irregular shallow pits with an average depth value of about
20.64 μm, and the texture was clearly visible. A comparison
of the surface morphology of these three coupons further confirmed
that carbon steel corrosion in HCl solution was successfully inhibited
by the added SFHP.

of C-steel samples: (a) polished, (b) immersed in 1 M HCl without
pectin, and (c) with 5.0 g L–1 SHFP.

2.6.2 Contact Angle Measurement
The contact
angles of the C-steel samples in the absence and presence of SHFP
for 48 h immersion in 1 M HCl were investigated through water contact
angle measurements, and the results are shown in Figure 13. The water contact angle
of the polished C-steel samples surface was observed to be 80.60°
± 0.20, and it can be seen that the water contact angle decreased
from 80.60° ± 0.20 to 47.25° ± 0.45 after immersion
for 48 h. The decrease in contact angle was attributed to the increase
in surface roughness caused by the corrosive attack of HCl. In comparison,
the contact angle of C-steel samples (after 48 h immersion) in the
presence of 5 g L–1 SHFP increased to 70.55°
± 0.15, which suggested that the SHFP was continuously adsorbed and accumulated on the C-steel sample surface and provided a stronger
protection ability for C-steel samples.

immersed in 1 M HCl without pectin, and (c) with 5.0 g L–1 SHFP.

2.6.3 SEM-EDX Analysis
To analyze the
C-steel surface morphology in 1 M HCl solution in the absence and
presence of 5.0 g L–1 SHFP (Mw = 4.50 kDa) after 48 h of immersion at 25 °C, it was
tested by SEM-EDX. Analysis of the micrograph results was shown in Figure 14a–c. The
surface of the C-steel was strongly corroded with remarkable localized
pits (Figure 14b),
which could be attributed to the corrosive attack by the 1 M HCl solution.
Comparing Figure 14b with Figure 14a
for polished C-steel, it was revealed that the C-steel surface exhibits
uniform corrosion and is accompanied by localized corrosion. The C-steel
surface, which in the presence of 0.5 g L–1 SHFP
is comparatively smoother than in its absence, further suggested that
the SHFP molecules could adsorb on the surface of C-steel to form
a protective film to prevent carbon steel corrosion. The N elements
were detected on the C-steel surface (Figure 14c-1), and the intensities of C and O elements
increased evidently, owing to the adsorption of SHFP molecules on
the C-steel surface. Therefore, the EDX analysis also reveals that
the SHFP molecules adsorbed on the C-steel surface to inhibit the
dissolution of C-steel.

M HCl without pectin, and (c) with 5.0 g L–1 SHFP.

2.7 Computational Studies
2.7.1 Quantum Chemical Study
The quantum
chemical calculation was used to analyze the electron efficiency and
molecular structure of SHFP monomers for corrosion inhibition. The
optimized molecular structures and the frontier molecular orbital
density distributions (LOMO and HOMO) of galacturonic acid in the
aqueous phase were obtained from the B3LYP/6-311G++ method,
and the results are shown in Figure 15. The parameters obtained from the quantum chemical
including ELOMO, EHOMO, μ (dipole moment), and EL–H are shown in Table 5. The frontier orbital energy parameters were calculated by eqs 8–10,32,33 which is according to Koopman’s theorem. 8   9   10  where A represents
the electron affinity of the molecule of SHFP, and I represents the ionization potential.

Figure 15 Optimized molecular structures of galacturonic acid obtained from
the B3LYP/6-311G++ method and the frontier molecular orbital
density distributions (LOMO and HOMO).

galacturonic acid	–7.438	0.574	8.012	4.006	0.250	3.432	0.891	
The absolute electronegativity (χ) was calculated by eq 11, which reflects the
electron attraction ability of a group of atoms toward the SHFP molecule 11  

The global hardness (η) and the global softness (σ)
can be calculated by eqs 17 and 18 12   13  

The fraction of electrons transferred between inhibitor molecules
and the metal surface can be estimated according to the following
equation 14  where χFe represents the absolute electronegativity of C-steel, χinhibitor represents the absolute electronegativity of inhibitor,
ηFe represents the absolute hardness of iron, and
ηinhibitor represents the absolute hardness of inhibitor.
ΔN reflects the electron donating ability and
the trend of electron donation of the corrosion inhibitor molecule.
To calculate the related parameters, we used a theoretical value χFe = 7 eV and a global hardness ηFe = 0, assuming I = A for the bulk metal.34

The ELOMO, EHOMO, and ΔEL–H were directly
related to inhibition efficiency. A higher value of EHOMO means that the inhibitor has a higher inhibition
efficiency and a stronger chemisorption ability. On the other hand,
a lower value of ELUMO means that the
inhibitor could accept electrons from the filled orbitals of metal
via retrodonation, and the smaller energy gap means a greater inhibitor
efficiency and a stronger chemisorbed bond. From Table 5, it was obvious that the galacturonic
acid had a lower value of χ, which suggested that the galacturonic
acid has a higher tendency of electron donation. A higher value of
global hardness (η) means the lesser tendency of electron transfer
with the addition of galacturonic acid. However, the higher σ
value means the higher reactivity of galacturonic acid. Thus, these
data correlated well with those of the trend in the energy gap values
shown above. From the data shown in Table 5, ΔN > 0 was for the
galacturonic acid, so the electrons are transferred from the galacturonic
acid molecule to the C-steel surface. Therefore, the trend of quantum
chemical parameters obtained by calculation was consistent with the
experimental results of corrosion inhibition efficiency. In summary,
the inhibition capacity of SHFP could be ascribed to the adsorption
of galacturonic acid constituents on the surface of the C-steel.

2.7.2 MD Simulation
MD simulations have
been widely used in the discussion of the adsorption behavior of the
inhibitor molecule on the metal surface so as to analyze the inhibition
mechanisms in the atomistic level. We obtained the top and side views
of the configurations of galacturonic acid over the Fe(110) surface,
and the results are displayed in Figure 16. The information we obtained from Figure 16 was that the galacturonic
acid molecules adsorbed on the Fe(110) surface with an almost flat
orientation. It was beneficial for improving the surface coverage
of galacturonic acid on the C-steel.

Figure 16 Equilibrium adsorption of inhibitors on the Fe(110) surface at
25 °C obtained by MD simulations.

The parameters of Eadsorption and Ebinding were used to analyze the extent of interaction
of the galacturonic acid adsorbed on the Fe(110) surface, and they
can be calculated by eqs 15 and 16 15   16  where, Etotal is the total energy of the simulation system, Esurface + solution is the total energy
of the system without the inhibitor, Einhibition + solution is the total energy of the system without the iron crystal, and Esolution is the total energy of the solution.

The calculated interaction energies and adsorption energies are
listed in Table 6.
It is obvious that it shows negative values of the binding energy
between galacturonic acid and C-steel surface, which means that the
interaction between galacturonic acid and C-steel carbon is stable
and spontaneous.

3 Mechanism of Corrosion Inhibition
Theoretical calculations and experiment results indicated that
the SFHP with Mw = 4.50 kDa has a higher
inhibition efficiency; it could be due to degradation of long pectin
chains, through α-1,4-glycosidic linkage bond scission, to smaller
but nonentangled segments. These smaller segments of SHFP could be
adsorbed onto the surface of C-steel because they were easy to uncoil,
thereby forming stable layers with protective effects to improve the
inhibition efficiency. Therefore, reducing the molecular weight of
LMP was an effective way to increase its solubility and IEw%. However, lowering Mw did not always
increase IEw%. Galacturonic acid, which was the basic unit
of pectin, was also tested and found to be ineffective in inhibiting
C-steel corrosion. This was likely because this molecule is too small
to form a compact protective film. Hence, pectin as a high-performance
corrosion inhibitor needs to be of an appropriate Mw.

The mechanism of corrosion inhibition of LMP is hereby proposed
from the molecular level and schematically shown in Figure 17. Cl– was
known to have a synergistic effect with inhibitors for corrosion inhibition.
In this case, SFHP molecules were easily protonated in the acidic
solution and were positively charged, making it difficult for them
to adsorb onto the positively charged C-steel surface. Meanwhile,
Cl– in the HCl solution can be adsorbed easily due
to electrostatic interaction, making the net surface charge negative.
−COOH functional groups in the pectin molecules were easily
protonated into −COOH2+ in highly acidic solutions,
which can form van a der Waals bond with Cl– by
electrostatic interaction. Eventually, the adsorbed SFHP molecules
form a dense layer to protect the C-steel against corrosion. In summary,
the electrostatic interaction between protonated SFHP and Cl– on the C-steel surface was the cause of the physical adsorption.
The functional groups such as CH3COO– and −O–
in the SFHP molecular level could donate and share electrons to the
empty orbital of iron, substituting aggressive substances on the steel
surface and forming coordination bonds to adsorb on the metal surface,
thereby blocking the active sites exposed to corrosive media and reducing
corrosion attack.

Figure 17 Schematic of the adsorption mechanism of SFHP on the C-steel surface.

4 Conclusions
The following results can be drawn from this study:(1) SFHP acted as efficient corrosion
inhibitors of the carbon steel in 1 M HCl solution.

(2) The inhibition efficiency increased
with increasing pectin concentration and decreased with increasing
temperature.

(3) The low molecular weight can endow
SFHP with good solubility, extra adsorption, and even high corrosion
inhibition efficiency.

(4) The corrosion process was inhibited
by physisorption of SFHP on the carbon steel surface. Electrostatic
attraction between the adsorbed Cl– and protonated
pectin molecules was the main driving force.

(5) SFHP were mixed-type inhibitors with
predominant cathodic action, and the mode of inhibition was the blockage
of active sites of corrosion.

(6) Experiments, DFT, and MD simulation
were in good accordance with each other.



5 Materials and Methods
5.1 Materials
Sunflower heads were collected
from a farm in Shanxi Province of China in October 2018. d-galacturonic acid was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co. Ltd., cellulase enzyme (≥ 40 u/mg) was purchased from Shanghai
Lanji Science and Technology Development Co., and citrus peel pectin
(Mw = 30–100 kDa, DE = 60%) was
purchased from Sigma. The reagents employed in this study were obtained
from the following commercial sources: cellulase enzyme (AR, Aladdin
Reagents (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.), citric acid (AR, Aladdin Reagents
(Shanghai) Co., Ltd.), and sodium citrate (AR, Aladdin Reagents (Shanghai)
Co., Ltd.). The components of the carbon steel (C-steel) used in all
corrosion experiments were as follows: 0.5% C, 0.37% Si, 0.8% Mn,
0.04% P, 0.045% S, 0.25% Cr, 0.25% Ni, 0.25% Cu, and 97.495% Fe. The
dimensions of the C-steel coupons used for weight loss and electrochemical
measurements were 25.0 mm × 10.0 mm × 2.0 mm and 10.0 mm
× 10.0 mm × 2.0 mm, respectively.

5.2 Extraction of Sunflower Head Pectin Samples
and Test Solutions
In pretreatment of sunflower heads, the
sunflower heads were washed with deionized water to remove impurities.
The samples were then divided into three portions and vacuum-dried
at 60, 100, or 150 °C for 4 h. Finally, the three samples were
separately crushed into powder in a grinder.

In extraction of
pectin, 4.0 g of the prepared sunflower heads powder was added to
a mixture of 100 mL of deionized water, 2.0 g of cellulase enzyme,
0.86 g of citric acid, and 1.74 g of sodium citrate. Pectin was extracted
in a shaker at 60 °C for 4 h. Afterward, the mixture was boiled
for 5 min to inactivate the cellulase and centrifuged at 6000 rpm
for 20 min. In the subsequent step, the supernatant from centrifugation
was filtered through G3 sintered discs to remove solid residues, and
the supernatant was stored at 4 °C. Finally, 2.5× volume
of 95% acidified ethanol was poured slowly into the cooled supernatant,
followed by filtration through cheesecloth. Pectin (the white floc)
was rinsed with 95% ethanol and vacuum-dried. The dried pectin was
ground and stored for follow-up tests.35,36

The DE value of SFHP was measured using the titrimetric method.37 The Mw was determined
by a method modified from that reported by Zhang et al.38 A sodium nitrate solution (50 mM) containing
0.02% sodium azide (NaN3) was used as the mobile phase
at 35 °C. Dextran standards (Mw =
180, 3650, 20,100, 62,600, 102,000, and 226,700 Da; Sigma) were used
to establish the standard curve (log Mw = −0.5059x + 11.472; R2 = 0.992). The Mw and DE values
of SFHP extracted at 60, 100, and 150 °C are 154.64 kDa and 41.14%,
97.23 kDa and 40.24%, and 4.50 kDa and 30.14%, respectively. The SHFP
with different Mw were characterized by
FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy, and the results are given
in Section 2.1.

The test solutions used in corrosion experiments (1 M HCl with
or without SFHP) were prepared according to the following process.
A given amount of pectin sample (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 5.0 g L–1) was dissolved in 250 mL of deionized water and transferred
to a 500 mL volumetric flask. Concentrated 37% HCl and deionized water
were used to adjust the HCl concentration and volume of the solution
to 1 M and 500 mL, respectively.

5.3 Weight Loss Measurements
The strip
C-steel coupons (50 by 25 by 2) were prepared as the
static weight loss test specimens, abraded with a series of emery
papers (grades 400, 800, 1500, 3000, 5000, and 7000), and washed with
distilled water and acetone in sequence. After washing, the cleaned
samples were dried in warm air flow and weighed accurately with a
sensitivity of ±10–4 g. Then, the samples were
immersed in 500 mL of 1 M HCl solution with and without various concentrations
of SHFP at given temperatures (15, 20, 25, and 30 °C). After
48 h immersion, the samples were taken out, washed again with distilled
water and ethanol, and finally dried to constant weight. In the present
study, each test solution containing three coupons was carried at
ambient conditions, and the average values of three replicates are
reported.

The corrosion rate (Rc) was calculated according eq 17, and the inhibition efficiency (IEw%) was calculated
according to eq 18 17   18  where M0 and M are the weights (mg) of the C-steel
before and after immersion in HCl solution, respectively. A (cm2) is the surface area of the test coupon,
and t = 48 h is the test time. RC0 and RCi are the corrosion
rates of C-steel coupon in 1 M HCl without and with SFHP, respectively.

5.4 Electrochemical Impedance and Potentiodynamic
Polarization Curves
Electrochemical measurements were carried
out on an electrochemical workstation (IM6, Zahner, Germany) using
a three-electrode system at 25 °C (± 1 °C) in the prepared
inhibited solutions. The three-electrode system included a saturated
calomel electrode (reference electrode), a platinum sheet (counterelectrode),
and a C-steel coupon enwrapped in epoxy resin with only one exposed
surface of 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm (working electrode). To obtain a stable
open-circuit potential (Eocp) and ensure
that the SHFP molecules were adsorbed on the C-steel surface, the
electrodes need to be immersed in the test solution for 30 min41.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
was performed by sweeping from 15 kHz to 10 mHz at Eocp with an amplitude of sinusoidal disturbance of 10
mV. We used the Zsimpwin 3.10 impedance analysis software to fit the
impedance curves, and we obtained the equivalent circuits and relevant
parameters.

Finally, the polarization curves were obtained by sweeping from
−0.8 to 0.5 mV at 1 mV/s scan rate.39 The polarization parameters, which include corrosion current density,
corrosion potential, and Tafel slope, were obtained by Tafel extrapolation.

5.5 Measurement of the Potential of Zero Charge
EIS was performed in the test solution with 5.0 g L–1 SFHP at different potentials. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) at each potential was calculated from the
obtained data and plotted on a curve versus the potential (V). The
potential of zero charge (Epzc) was then
determined as the applied potential where Cdl was at the minimum in the curve.

5.6 Surface Analysis
5.6.1 3D Super Depth Digital Microscopy Analysis
The surface morphology of C-steel in pristine condition and after
corrosion in HCl solution without and with 5.0 g L–1 SFHP was investigated using a digital microscope (VHX-2000, Keyence,
Japan). The surface morphology and 3D corrosion depth maps were obtained
at a magnification of 500×.

5.6.2 Contact Angle Measurement
The characteristic
hydrophilic or hydrophobic behavior of 5.0 g L–1 SFHP in 1 M HCl solution was investigated directly by the water
contact angle measurement. Water (10 μL) was dropped onto the
medium steel surface using a microsyringe, and the average of contact
angles was reported by taking the measurement from similar images
taken along the interface of carbon steel and water droplet at several
locations. The steel surfaces were analyzed after 48 h immersion in
1 M HCl. All the measured contact angles are shown in Figure 13.

5.6.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy Analysis (SEM)
The surface morphologies of the C-steel samples were observed by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using Hitachi S-4800. The test
was under the condition of 20 kV acceleration voltage, and the samples
were immersed in a 1 M HCl solution in the presence and absence of
the SHFP for 48 h.

5.7 Computational Studies
The galacturonic
acid residue was the structural unit of the main chain of the pectin
molecule. Therefore, the adsorption of pectin molecules was simulated
by using galacturonic acid to study the inhibition mechanism of pectin.

5.7.1 Quantum Chemical Studies
The quantum
chemical calculations used the Gaussian-03 software package, and we
obtained the geometrically optimized configuration of galacturonic
acid at the B3LYP level of DFT using the 6-311G+ + (d, p) basis set for all atoms. The key parameters of quantum chemical
calculations including the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO), highest occupied molecular (EHOMO), energy gap (ΔE), global
softness (σ), global hardness (η), number of transferred
electron (ΔN), and the absolute electronegativity
(χ) of galacturonic acid were obtained.

5.7.2 Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation
MD simulation studies used the software of Material Studio 5.5. The
Fe(110) plane, which is the most densely and stably packed, was chosen
to model a simulation box (2.86 nm × 4.05 nm × 5.89 nm)
with periodic boundary conditions. Therefore, Fe(110) was first cleaved
from the pure Fe crystal and then converted to an appropriate super
cell by putting a vacuum space with a thickness of about 3 nm. The
triazine derivative molecule with energy-minimized geometry was added
to this super cell and positioned above its atomic row. The MD simulation
was carried out in a water condition, and the adsorption system constructed
by the Amorphous Cell Program included 982 H2O, 18 H3O+, 18 Cl–, and 1 galacturonic
acid molecule. The corrosion system was built via placing the Amorphous
Cell on the Fe(110) super cell by Layer Builder, and the super cell
was kept fixed. The MD simulations were performed by the COMPASS force
field under NVT ensemble at 298 K with a time step of 0.1 fs and a
simulation time of 500 ps.
