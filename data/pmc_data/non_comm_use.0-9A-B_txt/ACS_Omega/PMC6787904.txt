Post-translational
modifications (PTMs) of proteins provide an
important mechanism for cell signal transduction control. Impaired
PTM control is a key feature in multiple different disease states,
and thus the enzyme-controlling PTMs have drawn attention as highly
promising drug targets. Due to the importance of PTMs, various methods
to monitor PTM enzyme activity have been developed, but universal
high-throughput screening (HTS), a compatible method for different
PTMs, remains elusive. Here, we present a homogeneous single-label
thermal dissociation assay for the detection of enzymatic PTM removal.
The developed method allows the use of micromolar concentration of
substrate peptide, which is expected to be beneficial when monitoring
enzymes with low activity and peptide binding affinity. We prove the
thermal dissociation concept functionality using peptides for dephosphorylation,
deacetylation, and demethylation and demonstrate the HTS-compatible
flash isothermal method for PTM enzyme activity monitoring. Using
specific inhibitors, we detected literature-comparable IC50 values and Z′ factors from 0.61 to 0.72,
proving the HTS compatibility of the thermal peptide-break technology.

Introduction
Protein post-translational modifications
(PTMs) are covalent additions
or proteolytic cleavage events which represent an essential regulatory
mechanism involved in cellular signal transduction processes. Protein
PTM dynamics are regulated by a vast number of enzymes called “writers”
and “erasers” depending on the nature and function of
the PTM.1,2 Targeting of deficient enzymes to treat
different diseases, e.g., cancer, diabetes, heart, and neurodegenerative
diseases, has been one of the main goals in modern drug discovery.3−5 Due to the apparent medical need for enzyme activity modulators,
e.g., kinase inhibitors,6 there is a constant
necessity for improved methodology.

A variety of sensitive high-throughput
screening (HTS) assays have
been developed to measure PTM enzyme activity. Nowadays, the tendency
is for the use of fluorescence-based methods since they are simple,
easy to automate, and relatively cost-effective. A broad range of
reporter labels including traditional fluorophores with short fluorescence
half-lives (<μs), e.g., fluorescein or rhodamine,7,8 and longer half-life luminophores (μs to ms), such as the
lanthanide (Ln3+)-based probes, have been widely used in
PTM enzyme assays. The interest for the use of Ln3+-probes
has increased as they can improve the assay sensitivity due to their
properties. Lanthanides provide longer luminescence lifetime and a
wider Stokes shift compared to traditional fluorophores, which have
mostly overlapping excitation and emission spectra.9−11 Time-resolved
luminescence (TRL) is a technology developed based on Ln3+ probes.12,13 In this system, luminescence signal is read
after a selected delay time set between the excitation pulse and the
lanthanide emission signal monitoring window, thus enabling short-lived
autoluminescence subtraction.14 The time-resolved
Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) is a dual-label
based method that utilizes energy transfer from a lanthanide donor
to an organic dye acceptor.15−19 Despite its high sensitivity, challenges appear during optimization
in relation to label conjugation and close proximity between the used
labels. Fluorescence polarization (FP) offers an easier-to-optimize
option as it is a single-label method. FP is based on the rotational
property differences of small vs large molecules and has been mostly
applied for kinases as good antibodies are available on the market.20−22 Whether single- or dual-label-based technique, most of the PTM assays
use antibodies for detection, creating the need to produce a particular
antibody for each studied PTM. For instance, phosphoserine or phosphothreonine
antibodies require a specific amino acid sequence near the binding
site. In this sense, the phosphosite diversity being recognized is
limited.20 Moreover, developing pan-specific
antibodies can be difficult due to the small size of some PTMs.23 Since the antibody availability is limited,
the PTM monitoring has been indirectly assayed using antibodies against
secondary products, e.g., UDP antibody in the case of target glycosylation.24 This affects the assay optimization and sensitivity
as enzyme cascades or chemical reactions are part of the detection.
FP and TR-FRET have been reported for ligases, kinases, methyltransferases,
fucosyltransferases, and glycosyltransferases.22−25 Antibody-free fluorescent methods
have also been reported. The immobilized metal-ion affinity particle
(IMAP) technology is an FP-based method that relies on the high-affinity
and covalent coordination of trivalent metal-containing nanoparticles
with phosphogroups.25 Omnia, on the other
hand, is a chelation-enhanced fluorescence method developed for phosphorylation.
In a kinase activity assay, the phosphate group located in the vicinity
of the coordinating fluorophore promotes the metal-ion binding, producing
an increase in the fluorescence signal.26 Although the methods are antibody-free, the nature of the approaches
has limited their applicability to phosphorylation.

Previously,
we have developed an antibody-free PTM monitoring method
called the peptide-break technology which allows the detection of
a variety of PTMs in a single platform.27−29 The peptide-break technology
is based on the peptide dimerization monitored using the single-label
quenching resonance energy transfer (QRET) technology demonstrated
previously for the detection of various PTM targets.30,31 Peptide dimer is formed between the Eu3+-labeled detection
peptide and the selected substrate peptide designed for the studied
PTM enzyme. In the absence of PTM, peptides form a complex leading
to high TRL signal due to Eu3+-chelate protection from
the soluble quenchers, while the PTM addition to the substrate peptide
dissociates the peptide complex and the TRL signal is quenched. We
have demonstrated that the peptide complex can be formed using either
specific leucine zippers or merely charge-based interactions.27−29 This concept provides versatility to the system and allows assay
optimizations of a variety of PTM types using nanomolar concentration
of reagents.

Herein, we introduce a fluorescent single-label
thermal dissociation
assay for the monitoring of enzymatic PTM removal using the peptide-break
technology. The fluorescence thermal dissociation assay harnesses
the stability difference between the post-translationally modified
and the nonmodified peptide dimer forced together at high substrate
peptide concentration. The increase of the temperature decreases the
peptide complex stability, being more stable without a PTM. As a result,
a higher TRL signal is detected with a complex without a PTM at higher
temperatures. The proposed antibody-free HTS method enables the use
of high peptide concentrations, which is essential for some low-affinity
or -activity enzymes.32 The fluorescent
thermal dissociation assay is now demonstrated with methylation, dephosphorylation,
and deacetylation assays.

Results and Discussion
We have previously
developed the universal single-label peptide-break
technology for the detection of enzymatic PTM reactions using leucine
zippers or charge-based peptides.27−29 These assays were optimized
for detection at room temperature using low nanomolar peptide concentrations.
However, not all enzymes possess high peptide binding and enzymatic
activity allowing low substrate concentrations. This might reduce
the applicability of the peptide-break technology with some enzymes.
To address this potential shortcoming, we have now developed a thermal
dissociation-based peptide-break approach. The new assay protocol
enables the use of high substrate peptide concentration of the selected
peptide substrate for the studied PTM enzyme, which promotes the peptide–enzyme
interaction. The formed duplex of the detection peptide with the modified
and unmodified substrate can then be distinguished using the difference
in dissociation rates of the duplexes at higher temperatures. Such
a detection scheme is potentially suitable to low-activity or -affinity
enzyme monitoring. The principle of this method is presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Principle of the thermal
peptide-break technology. At room temperature,
high peptide concentration drives the peptide duplex formation irrespective
of the PTM. At increasing temperatures, PTM-reduced duplex affinity
(purple) is disrupted at lower temperature compared to the dimer without
a PTM (orange line). At the optimal temperature, the duplex with a
PTM is dissociated, allowing signal attenuation due to the quenchers
in solution, while the nonmodified dimer remains intact, resulting
in Eu3+ chelate protection and high TRL signal.

Thermal Dissociation-Based Peptide-Break Technique Enables the
Detection of Small Nonmodified Peptide Population from the Large Modified
Peptide Pool
The peptide-break technology relies on the affinity
difference between modified and unmodified substrate peptide and the
Eu3+-labeled reporter peptide upon enzymatic PTM addition
or removal.27−29 The method enables detection of different PTMs by
simply changing the PTM-modified peptide, while the Eu3+-labeled reporter peptide remains the same. Affinity difference of
the modified vs nonmodified peptide provides the basis to distinguishing
bound vs nonbound peptide fractions using a homogeneous single-label
QRET detection.27−31 We have previously shown that high peptide concentration efficiently
promotes the modification-independent peptide pair formation, leading
to peptide paring at all time.27 It is
well known that temperature affects the equilibrium of reactants,
and at high temperatures, proteins and peptides are denatured and
biomolecular interactions are weakened. We decided to use this temperature-related
effect to discriminate the binding of modified and nonmodified peptides
to the Eu3+-labeled reporter (Figure 1). This was developed to improve the applicability
of the peptide-break technology for PTM enzymes possessing low activity
or peptide binding affinity, as it enabled the use of micromolar substrate
peptide.

To demonstrate the concept functionality, we performed
a binding test with a number of peptides in high concentration without
a PTM and peptides containing two phophoryls, acetyl, or methyl sites.
First, we studied the effect of phosphoryl groups using Eu–LZ
detection peptide in complex with LZ-Y and LZ-pY substrates.29 TRL signal was monitored using 5 °C measurement
interval from RT until 95 °C (Figure 2a,b). A clear difference between the signals
of LZ-Y and LZ-pY was observed between 60 and 80 °C. Thereafter,
similar thermal ramping was performed with the two charge-based peptide
pairs for deacetylation and demethylation, CP7/CP6 and CP9/CP8 (Figure 2b).28 These peptides did not contain a leucine zipper structure
similar to LZ-Y/LZ-pY, and the optimal temperature for these peptide
pairs was significantly lower (Figure 2b). The observed S/B ratios for LZ-Y/LZ-pY, CP7/CP6,
and CP9/CP8 in RT at 10 μM concentration were 1.8, 3.3, and
2.8, respectively. With increasing temperature, heat-induced separation
between Eu–LZ and the substrate peptides gave the maximal S/B
ratio of 36, which was monitored with the leucine zipper LZ-Y/LZ-pY
peptides at the optimal temperature of 70 °C. In case of both
charge-based peptide pairs, the peak shape was broader and the monitored
S/B ratios were lower compared to LZ peptides. The optimal temperatures
for the charged-based CP7/CP6 peptide pair were 50 and 45 °C
for CP9/CP8. The observed S/B ratios for CP7/CP6 and CP9/CP8 were
10.5 and 5.1, respectively. The affinity difference between peptide
pairs partly explains the difference in the optimal temperatures and
also the higher S/B ratio observed at room temperature for CP peptides
compared to LZ peptides. Also the nature of CP and LZ peptides is
different, explaining the temperature differences and the sharp temperature
profile of LZ peptides compared to the shallow profile of the CP peptides
(Figure 2b). The difference
in the S/B ratios and temperature curves confirmed the previous observation
that LZ complex possesses higher affinity than CP complexes to Eu–LZ
peptide. Data also clearly showed the functionality of the nonenzymatic
thermal-break concept using modified and nonmodified peptides.

Figure 2 Temperature
dependence of the thermal peptide-break approach using
the QRET detection. (A) TRL signals of 10 μM LZ-Y (black) and
LZ-pY (red) in complex with Eu–LZ showed a clear temperature-dependent
decrease and a PTM-dependent separation as a function of temperature.
In the presence of soluble quencher MT10, efficient dissociation of
LZ-pY from the Eu–LZ complex is observed at 10–15°
lower temperature as for LZ-Y. The maximal S/B ratio with LZ peptides
was achieved at 70 °C. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3). (B) In the presence of 10 μM LZ-Y or LZ-pY,
CP7 or CP6, and CP9 or CP8, the binding behavior was monitored with
Eu–LZ (1 nM). At RT, high TRL signals and low S/B ratios were
observed for all peptide complexes in the presence of soluble quencher.
TRL signals of LZ-Y, CP7, and CP9 complexes were compared to the TRL
signals of LZ-pY, CP6, and CP8, respectively. At elevated temperature,
the PTM-modified lower-affinity peptides, LZ-pY, CP6, and CP9, were
dissociated from the Eu–LZ reporter inducing a drastic TRL
signal decrease compared to their counterparts still forming a relatively
stable complex with Eu–LZ.

Next, the sensitivity of the thermal peptide-break assay was evaluated
using LZ-Y and LZ-pY peptides at RT and at the optimal 70 °C
temperature using the slow step-by-step heating. The data are collected
at 70 °C. In the assay, LZ-Y and LZ-pY were added in different
ratios keeping the overall peptide concentration at 10 μM to
mimic the enzymatic reaction. The resulting TRL signals were then
compared to the TRL signals measured for 100% LZ-pY. As previously,
the difference between LZ-Y and LZ-pY was barely detectable at 25
°C, and LZ-Y could not be separated from LZ-pY at any concentration
(Figure 3). However,
at 70 °C, a separation between peptides was detected with the
maximal S/B ratio over 20, when only LZ-Y was present. Already less
than 1% of LZ-Y was clearly detected at 70 °C with an S/B ratio
of ∼7. This 1% corresponds to 100 nM concentration of LZ-Y
in the presence of 9.9 μM LZ-pY, providing the basis to detect
low degree of enzymatic conversion. Based on these data, the linear
range of detection is from 1 μM to 10 nM. More than 1 μM
of LZ-Y gives S/B ratio similar to the 100% LZ-Y and less than 10
nM LZ-Y results in S/B ratio close to 1 (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Temperature dependence of the thermal peptide-break
approach with
high peptide concentration. The detection sensitivity of the thermal
peptide-break approach was monitored by mimicking the enzymatic activity
by varying LZ-Y and LZ-pY ratio at fixed 10 μM total peptide
concentration. At 25 °C, no separation between PTM-modified LZ-pY
and unmodified LZ-Y peptide was monitored. At 70 °C, high degree
of separation was monitored and already less than 1% of LZ-Y was efficiently
detected from the large pool of LZ-pY. Data represent mean ±
SD (n = 3).

Thermal Peptide-Break Assay Enables the Enzymatic Dephosphorylation
and Deacetylation Activity Monitoring
As the thermal peptide-break
assay showed good functionality with the nonenzymatic assays, we decided
to prove the concept functionality with two enzymatic reactions, dephosphorylation
(PTP1B) and deacetylation (HDAC3). First, the assays were performed
in the presence and absence of saturating concentration of specific
inhibitors Na3VO4 and trichostatin A for PTP1B
and HDAC3, respectively. Using a temperature ramping protocol from
25 to 80 °C (LZ-pY) and from 25 to 60 °C (CP6), a highly
similar temperature profile in the enzymatic assay was monitored as
previously with the nonenzymatic reactions (Figures 2b and 4). In the assay
with 10 μM LZ-pY and 1 nM PTP1B, the highest S/B ratio with
1 μM Na3VO4 inhibited vs noninhibited
reaction was 25 when the measurement was performed after heating at
70 °C (Figure 4a). This is in line with those obtained without enzyme reaction,
indicating highly efficient enzyme reaction under these conditions.
In the HDAC3 assay with CP6, the peak shape was again broader compared
to the LZ-pY profile, and the S/B ratio was 3.8 as monitored between
45 and 55 °C using 1 and 0 μM trichostatin A (Figure 4b). Also in this
case, the thermal peak shapes and S/B ratios were highly similar to
nonenzymatic assays.

Figure 4 Temperature profiles of the enzymatic PTM removal assays
using
PTP1B and HDAC3. TRL signals of enzymatic reactions without an inhibitor
were compared to the TRL signals of the inhibited enzymatic reactions.
(A) High S/B ratio was observed at 70 °C for LZ-pY in the PTP1B
enzyme reaction without or with 1 μM Na3VO4. (B) S/B ratio of nearly 4 was observed at 45–55 °C
when CP6 was assayed with HDAC3 and 0 or 1 μM trichostatin A.
Highly similar peak shape inherent to each peptide pair was found
for enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions. Data represent mean ±
SD (n = 3).

To analyze the assay concept functionality further, we performed
inhibitor titrations with PTP1B and HDAC3, using Na3VO4 and trichostatin A, respectively. The same temperature cycle
with 5 °C incremental steps was carried out as previously, and
the maximal responses were detected at the optimal temperatures, 70
°C for LZ-pY and 50 °C for CP6. The IC50 value
could be recorded even at lower temperatures, but to get the maximal
S/B ratio out from the system, it is best to use the optimal temperature.
This being said, the IC50 value is the same in every temperature
point, but the S/B ratio changes. A titration curve for the inhibitors
was fitted to these optimal temperatures, and the calculated IC50 values for Na3VO4 and trichostatin
A were 3.8 and 1.1 nM, respectively (Figure 5). These values are in good correlation with
the previously reported values by us and others.27,33,34

Figure 5 Inhibitor titration curves for Na3VO4 at
70 °C and trichostatin A at 50 °C. (A) The enzymatic reactions
with LZ-pY were heated in 5 °C intervals, and the peak maximum
temperature was used to show the dose response for the used inhibitor.
Based on the dose–response curves, the IC50 value
for PTP1B inhibitor Na3VO4 was 3.8 nM. (B) From
the deacetylation reaction with CP6, dose–response curve at
50 °C showed IC50 of 1.1 nM for HDAC3 inhibitor trichostatin
A. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3).

Single-Temperature Flash Heating Assay Showed Good HTS Compatibility
In all previous assays, thermal ramping was applied to monitor
PTM-dependent thermal separation of the used peptides. As the optimal
assay conditions were peptide-pair-dependent and equal-temperature
profiles were measured for nonenzymatic and enzymatic reactions, it
is expected that single temperature can be used to obtain PTM-dependent
separation. The thermal ramping protocol is time-consuming, and thus
a protocol with a single heating step is favored, as it is readily
adaptable to HTS. We tested the assay at a single flash temperature,
using the peptide-specific optimal temperatures determined earlier,
70 °C for the LZ-pY and 50 °C for the CP6. With the flash
heating mode, the complex was kept at selected temperature for 3 min
before the immediate measurement. Thereafter, the plate was allowed
to cool down to RT and measurements were repeated after 20 and 60
min at RT. These measurements with the commercial peptides at RT were
beneficial for the reproducibility compared to the high-temperature
measurement directly after 70 °C (Figure 6a).

Figure 6 Thermal peptide-break assay using flash heating.
(A) Plate cooling
lowered the S/B ratio of the peptide assays approximately 20%, but
due to the lower variation, the Z′ factor
was significantly improved. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 24). (B) Z′ factor measurement
for the enzymatic dephosphorylation and deacetylation assays with
18 replicates. Dephosphorylation assay with (red) and without (black)
5 μM Na3VO4 and deacetylation assays with
(green) and without (blue) trichostatin A gave Z′
values of 0.72 and 14.6 and S/B ratios of 0.61 and 3.0, respectively.

We also observed that EuLZ complexes are not capable
of reassociating
after heating at RT, as cooling did not significantly change the S/B
ratio. When the plate is measured hot, the S/B ratio is higher than
if the plate is allowed to cool down (Figure 6a). The TRL signals are low and the deviation
is high when measured directly after 70 °C. When the plate is
allowed to cool down, the signal levels rise, but the S/B ratio remains.
Also the deviation decreases. This seems to be due to the time the
plate reader takes to measure a large assay. Because of the increase
in the TRL signal levels during the cooling down, the first measured
wells give a lower signal value than the last measured wells.

Next we converted the flash heating experiment with the peptides
to enzymatic reactions and determined Z′ factors
for both dephosphorylation and deacetylation, by running 18 reactions
under fully inhibited (5 μM Na3VO4 and
trichostatin A) and noninhibited conditions for PTP1B and HDAC3 (Figure 6b). We allowed the
plate cooling to RT before measuring due to the previous result shown
in Figure 6a. In the
enzymatic dephosphorylation assay, the S/B ratio and Z′ factor monitored after dissociation at 70 °C were 15
and 0.72, respectively. As a control, the nonenzymatic assay with
LZ-Y/LZ-pY gave an S/B ratio of 31, again in line with the previous
(data not shown). For the enzymatic deacetylation assay, the S/B ratio
was 4.6 with or without 5 μM trichostatin A and the Z′ factor was 0.61 (Figure 6b). The results clearly imply that the flash
heating is amenable to monitor enzymatic reactions with increased
simplicity and good HTS compatibility.

The introduced thermal
peptide-break method utilizes PTM-dependent
thermal dissociation of the peptide–peptide pair. The platform
enables the use of high peptide substrate concentration, which is
expected to be beneficial with enzymes having relatively low peptide
binding affinity and low activity, or potentially when assay is performed
with nonoptimal substrate sequence. The single previously designed
Eu3+ peptide was applied with two different substrate strategies,
zipper vs charged, and with two enzymes, PTP1B and HDAC3. With the
CP peptides, the substrate sequence is simplified compared to LZ,
where leucines need to be positioned in the seven repeats potentially
limiting the use of long consensus sequences extending to the crucial
leucine positions.27−29 However, we observed that the LZ strategy is beneficial
in the detection of thermal dissociation as the affinity is higher
and peak shape is sharper compared to shallow peak behavior of the
CP peptides. Some differences in the measured S/B ratios and Z′-factor values were recorded between the measurements
for both the CP peptides and the LZ peptide. This is possibly due
to the low background signal levels. The detected background signal
levels were close to the signal levels from an empty well so even
a small change in this signal level will affect the S/B ratio greatly.
In this study, the method was merely applied to detect the removal
of a PTM, but the concept is also expected to function with enzymes
adding a PTM to substrate peptides.

Conclusions
In
this work, we have developed a thermal peptide-break platform
for single-label detection of enzymatic PTM removal utilizing TRL
signal readout. The assay utilizes the previously introduced concept,
peptide-break, with nanomolar sensitivity but now by applying temperature-controlled
approach, which enables the use of micromolar peptide concentrations.
The method is based on heat-induced dissociation distinguishing a
proportion of peptide where PTM is enzymatically removed from a large
pool of peptide substrate carrying PTM. The thermal peptide-break
technique was proved to be functional in monitoring of PTP1B and HDAC3
enzymatic activities, and the results obtained from nonenzymatic demethylation
indicates broad suitability for a variety of PTMs. Method functionality
was first demonstrated with heat-ramping scheme to optimize the heat-induced
detection, and thereafter the assay was converted to flash mode to
enable HTS. In conclusion, we expect that the developed thermal peptide-break
assay platform is useful addition for advanced approaches to study
PTMs and enzyme inhibitors and activators in a single peptide-based
platform.

TRL signals were measured using Victor
1420 multilabel counter from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences,
Wallac (Turku, Finland), using 340 nm excitation and 615 nm emission
wavelengths and 400 μs delay and integration times. Temperature
cycling was carried out with a PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller
(MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA).

Assay Concept Functionality
with Synthetically Modified Peptides
The peptide binding
tests were performed for LZ-Y and LZ-pY peptides
in assay buffer 1 (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1
mM EDTA, 5 mM NaCl, and 0.01% Triton X-100) and for CP7 and CP6 peptides
and CP9 and CP8 peptides in assay buffer 2 (20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0),
1 mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 0.01% Triton X-100).
All assays were performed as triplicate. Buffers were selected based
on the PTP1B (buffer 1) and HDAC3 (buffer 2) preferences.27 In the assays, 20 μL of varying peptides
(10 μM) and 30 μL of detection solution, containing Eu–LZ
(1 nM) and soluble modulator MT10, were added to the wells. The microtiter
plate was heated and measured in 5 °C intervals from +25 °C
until the TRL signal levels reached the background signal level.

Enzymatic PTM Monitoring
Enzyme reactions were carried
out in the enzyme-specific selected assay buffers described above.
All assays were performed as triplicate in the final volume of 50
μL. We performed inhibitor titration (0–1 μM) with
Na3VO4 for PTP1B and trichostatin A for HDAC3.
Inhibitors and enzyme solution were added, both 5 μL. Thereafter,
10 μL of LZ-pY (PTP1B) or CP6 (HDAC3) was added and reactions
were incubated for 30 min (PTP1B) or 45 min (HDAC3) at RT. Detection
solution (1 nM Eu–LZ and MT10) was added in 30 μL, and
after 5 min of incubation, heating cycle with 5 °C interval was
started and TRL signals were monitored in every step until the signal
reached the background level. Similar assays were also performed by
using single saturating (1 μM) inhibitor concentration to achieve
full inhibition and maximal signal-to-background (S/B) ratio.

The flash mode protocol was performed in a single selected temperature
using 18 individual reactions. The enzyme reaction with PTP1B and
HDAC3 were performed with a protocol described previously by comparing
the reaction with 5 μM or no inhibitor. In the flash heating
mode, 50 μL reactions with detection component were heated for
3 min at the selected temperature, 70 °C for LZ-pY (PTP1b) and
45 °C for CP6 (HDAC3). For LZ-pY in PTP1B and for CP6 in HDAC3
reactions, the selected temperatures were 70 and 45 °C, respectively,
after the plate had time to cool down. The TRL signals were monitored
directly after flash heating and after the plate was cooled down to
RT (20 and 60 min).

Data Analysis
S/B ratio was calculated
by μmax/μmin and coefficient of
variation (CV%)
as (σ/μ) × 100. μmax and μmin are the mean values of three triplicates of luminescence
intensity signals. The Z′ factor was calculated
as . In all calculations,
σ refers as
standard deviations (SD) and μ as mean values. The half-maximal
inhibitor concentration (IC50) values and all other curves
were fitted using standard sigmoidal fitting functions with Origin
2016 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA).
