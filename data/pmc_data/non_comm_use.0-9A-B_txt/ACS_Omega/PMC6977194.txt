Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic
nosocomial pathogen and causes bacteremia, urinary tract infections,
meningitis, and pneumonia. The emergence of drug-resistant strain
makes most of the current antibiotics ineffective. It is high time
to screen some therapeutics against drug-resistant strains. Plant-based
medicines have recently emerged as one of the important therapeutic
choices. Therefore, in the present study, we have screened the metabolites
of Phyllanthus emblica, Ocimum tenuiflorum, and Murraya koenigii for their antibacterial effect against carabapenem-resistant strain
(RS-307) of A. baumannii. The result
showed that the methanolic extract of P. emblica inhibits the growth of RS-307. The composition of this extract was
determined using phytochemical screening and nuclear magnetic resonance
(1D and 2D-NMR). The mechanism of action of the plant extract was
validated by estimating reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation,
protein carbonylation, and membrane damage. The result showed that
treatment with this extract showed a significant elevation in the
production of ROS generations, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation.
This confirms that plant extract treatment confirmed ROS-dependent
membrane damage mechanism. The NMR result showed the presence of ethyl
gallate, ellagic acid, chebulagic acid, quercetin, flavonoid, and
alkaloid. To validate the antimicrobial activity of the secondary
metabolite (i.e., gallic acid), we synthesized gallate-polyvinylpyrrolidone-capped
hybrid silver nanoparticles (G-PVP–AgNPs) and characterized
using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). G-PVP–AgNPs
showed good antimicrobial activity against RS-307, and its mechanism
of action was investigated using fluorescence and transmission electron
microscopy and FTIR that confirmed ROS-dependent killing mechanism.
Therefore, the present study highlighted and recommended the use of
G-PVP–AgNPs as suitable therapeutics against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.

1 Introduction
Acinetobacter
baumannii is an opportunistic
pathogen that mainly causes hospital-acquired infections and emerges
in the military patients in Iraq and Kuwait.1 It causes infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream, and urinary
tract infections in the ICUs of hospitals.2,3 It
has developed antimicrobial resistance because of mutations that lead
to change in target, development of enzymes that inactivate antibiotics,
and reduction of access to bacterial targets.2,4A. baumannii has been termed as an ESKAPE pathogen
by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and WHO because of its
ability to escape antibiotics.5 Till present,
it has become resistant to most of the antibiotics; however, clinical
data showed that carbapenem, such as doripenem, meropenem, and imipenem,
are effective against A. baumannii,
but resistance has emerged against these drugs.6,7 Hospital-acquired
infections caused by resistant pathogens are responsible for high
morbidity and mortality;8−10 hence, their cure and prevention
are required at an urgent basis. Various approaches11−18 have been tried to control the drug-resistant A.
baumannii, but the eradication of the carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii is difficult.19 Different plant extracts are traditionally used to control infections
and are readily applicable, economic, and reasonable; hence, to eradicate
carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii,
various plant extracts can play a crucial role. Therefore, in the
present study, we have screened different extracts of medicinal plants
(P. emblica, M. koenigii, and O. tenuiflorum) for their antimicrobial
activity against the carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. We have identified the secondary metabolites in the selected plants
using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and explored their molecular
mechanism. The identified secondary metabolite was tagged on PVP-capped
silver nanoparticles (PVP–AgNPs), and the molecular mechanism
of its antibacterial activity was investigated using biochemical tests,
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), fluorescence microscopy,
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

2 Results
In the present study, we have used a pre-isolated clinical strain
of A. baumannii, that is, RS-307. This
strain is a multidrug-resistant clinical strain isolated from the
AIIMS, New Delhi.6 Similarly, RS-307 has
high MIC for different antibiotics such as amikacin (128 μg/mL),
ciprofloxacin (128 μg/mL), erythromycin (128 μg/mL), meropenem
(64 μg/mL), colistin (64 μg/mL), polymyxin B (64 μg/mL),
minocycline (16 μg/mL), and gentamicin (32 μg/mL), which
confirms its multidrug-resistant (MDR) nature.20

2.1 Methanol Extract of P. emblica Showed Antimicrobial Activity against RS-307
Different
plant extracts such as methanol, chloroform, and petroleum ether have
been prepared using a Soxhlet extractor for P. emblica, M. koenigii, and O. tenuiflorum. The antimicrobial activity of different
plant extracts was tested against carbapenem-resistant strain of A. baumannii (RS-307) via the disc diffusion assay
method. Disc diffusion assay confirms the best antimicrobial activity
in the methanol extract of P. emblica (10 μL) with a zone of inhibition of 1.2 cm. In contrast,
there was no zone of inhibition for O. tenuiflorum and M. koenigii. The methanol extract
of P. emblica was further analyzed
for the growth curve of RS-307 in triplicates (result is prepared
as mean). The growth curve also confirms the antimicrobial activity
of the methanol extract of P. emblica (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Growth kinetic
of A. baumannii strain
RS-307 was determined in the presence and absence of the methanol
extract of P. emblica by using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer at 605 nm. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM
of 3 values (n = 3) (Cavrg; average of the control, Tavrg; average
of the methanol extract of the P. emblica test).

2.2 Methanol
Extract of P. emblica Enhances Reactive
Oxygen Species Production
As the methanol
extract of P. emblica showed antimicrobial
activity, its molecular mechanism of action was determined. NBT assay
for untreated (control) and treated A. baumannii strain with the methanol extract of P. emblica showed a significant increase in the reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production in the treated samples as compared to the untreated bacterial
samples (Figure 2a).
This suggests the contribution of the ROS in the antimicrobial activity
of the P. emblica extract.

Figure 2 Increase in
the generation of total reactive oxygen species using
NBT as a substrate (A); enhanced production of MDA (malondialdehyde),
a marker of lipid peroxidation using TBARS assay (B); and high protein
carbonyl in the treated A. baumannii RS307 as compared to the untreated control (C). The data are expressed
as mean ± SEM of at least three values (n =
3). Values were measured via the ELISA reader.

2.3 High Lipid Peroxidation after Treatment with
the Methanol Extract of P. emblica
The enhanced ROS leads to lipid peroxidation; hence, it was also
estimated after treatment with the methanol extract of P. emblica. Lipid peroxidation has been estimated
for untreated (control) and treated samples in triplicates, and the
result are shown in Figure 2b. The result confirms the high lipid peroxidation in RS-307
after treatment with the methanol extract of P. emblica.

2.4 Methanolic Extract of P. emblica Increases Protein Carbonylation
Protein carbonylation is
protein oxidation of amino acid side chains that can be promoted by
ROS and can be detected by reaction to produce DNPH-detectable protein
products. The protein concentration was estimated via Bradford assay,
and 150 μg/μL protein was used in the present experiment.
Protein carbonylation was detected by the DNPH method. The result
showed that the methanol extract of P. emblica enhances the carbonyl content of RS-307 as compared to the untreated
sample (Figure 2c).
The result further supports the ROS-dependent mechanism.

2.5 Enhanced Membrane Leakage of Reducing Sugars
and DNA
The formation of ROS and lipid peroxidation will
cause membrane damage; hence, we have estimated the membrane damage
of RS-307 in the presence of the methanol extract of P. emblica. The membrane damage will cause the leakage
of the reducing sugar and DNA of bacterium, and the result showed
that membrane leakage of reducing sugars and DNA was found to be increased
after treatment with the methanol extract of P. emblica.

2.6 Phytochemical Components of P. emblica
The methanol extract of P. emblica showed good antimicrobial activity against
RS-307; hence, we performed phytochemical screening. The phytochemical
screening showed that it has tannins, phenol, glycosides, alkaloids,
anathraquinone, phytosterol, cuomarin, and chalcone; hence, it is
speculated that the antimicrobial activity of P. emblica may be associated with these compounds (Table 1).

2.7 NMR Spectroscopy Result Confirms Different
Metabolites in the Methanolic Extract of P. emblica
The NMR spectroscopy result confirmed the presence of different
primary and secondary metabolites in the methanol extract of P. emblica. It contains primary metabolites such
as sucrose, alpha-glucose, beta-glucose, citrate, proline, GABA, alanine,
threonine, valine, and beta-sitosterol and secondary metabolites such
as ethyl gallate (a phenolic acid), ellagic acid (a phenol), chebulagic
acid (a tannin), quercetin (a flavonoid), and alkaloid (Figure 3). The gallic acid derivative
(ethyl gallate) is the major secondary metabolite identified in the
methanolic extract of P. emblica.

Figure 3 1D-NMR
spectra are showing the presence of various primary and
secondary metabolites in the methanol extract of P.
emblica. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using
a 700 MHz NMR spectrometer (Agilent, USA).

2.8 Gallic Acid is Capped to the PVP–AgNPs
PVP–AgNPs have shown antimicrobial activity against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii;15 hence,
gallate-capped PVP–AgNPs were synthesized and validated for
their antimicrobial activity against this strain. The gallic acid-capped
PVP–AgNPs (G-PVP–AgNPs) are characterized by FTIR. The
various modes of vibrations were recognized and given to define the
different functional groups present in the given samples. FTIR spectra
of the G-PVP–AgNPs is characterized by the presence of the
major band at 3438, 2928, 1660, 1383, 1289, 1223, and 1079 cm–1 and minor peaks at 2875, 1432, and 578 cm–1 (Figure 4). The 3438
cm–1 band corresponds to the stretching vibration
of O–H and N–H groups, while the 2928 cm–1 band is due to the O–H stretching of carboxylic acid and
C–H stretching of alkane. The band at 1660 cm–1 corresponds to C=C stretching of alkene and C–H bending
of an aromatic compound. The band 1383 cm–1 is due
to the O–H bending of alcohol, C–H bending of aldehyde,
O–H bending of phenol, and C–H bending of alkane. A
band at 1289 cm–1 corresponds to the C–N
stretching of aromatic amines and C–O stretching of the aromatic
ester. The band at 1223 cm–1 corresponds to the
C–O stretching of alkyl aryl ether or vinyl ether and C–N
stretching of amine. The band at 1079 cm–1 corresponds
to the C–O stretching of primary alcohol and C–N stretching
of amines. The FTIR result confirms the presence of −OH, −NH,
C=C, and −COOH groups and the aromatic ring that indicates
the presence of gallic acid and PVP. The FTIR pattern is similar to
the PVP-capped AgNPs but the more intense peak at 3438 and 1383 cm–1.

Figure 4 FTIR spectra of the gallate-coated PVP–AgNPs. The
spectrum
shows the percentage of transmittance at different wavenumbers (cm–1).

2.9 Gallate-Capped
PVP–AgNPs Have Better
Antimicrobial Activity than PVP–AgNPs Alone
We have
tested the antimicrobial activity of G-PVP–AgNPs, and the result
showed that G-PVP–AgNPs have better antimicrobial activity
as compared to the PVP–AgNPs or methanol extract of P. emblica alone. Therefore, it is suggested that
G-PVP–AgNPs might be better than PVP–AgNPs to control
the carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.

2.10 Fluorescence Microscopy Confirms More Dead
Cells after Treatment with G-PVP–AgNPs
Viability assays
using the fluorescent dyes propidium iodide (PI) and acridine orange
(AO) have been developed for the concurrent determination of both
nonviable and viable cells. PI is imperviable to unbroken membranes
but easily permeates the membranes of nonviable cells and binds to
RNA or DNA, generating orange-red fluorescence. AO is a cationic dye
that can pervade through the membrane and shackle to nucleic acids
of viable cells and those at low concentrations, causing green fluorescence.
When PI and AO are used concurrently, nonviable cells fluoresce orange-red
and viable cells fluoresce green under fluorescence microscopy. Results
of fluorescence microscopy using AO and PI have been shown that there
is more death of bacteria after treatment with G-PVP–AgNPs,
PVP–AgNPs, and the polar extract of P. emblica as compared to the control (Figure 5). By comparison of all the three treatments, it was
observed that G-PVP–AgNPs (Figure 5D) showed more inhibitory effect as compared
to others (Figure 5A–C).

bacterial cells with G-PVP–AgNPs (D). The scale bar is shown
in pixels (px) where 1 px is 264.58 μm.

2.11 FTIR Spectra of Bacteria Confirm the Membrane
Damage
To assess the effect of PVP–AgNPs, G-PVP–AgNPs,
and the methanol extract of P. emblica on A. baumannii, we have performed
FTIR spectra of different bacterial samples treated with different
antimicrobials mentioned above. The experiments were performed in
triplicates, and individual spectra were obtained for each sample.
There was a significant spectral difference between the treated and
untreated samples related to FTIR spectra of molecules such as phospholipids
carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids. The result suggests a
remarkable shift in the FTIR spectra of amide A from 3397 cm–1 in the control to 3434 and 3435 cm–1 in G-PVP–AgNPs
and PVP–AgNPs, respectively (Figure 6), that shows that there is a damage in the
membrane. This treatment also results in the damage of lipids, which
is evident from the shift in spectra from 2928 to 2922 cm–1 in the treated samples. Treatment of G-PVP–AgNPs also resulted
in a shift of alpha-helix in a range of 1659–1637 cm–1. There was also a significant change in phospholipids that can be
seen from the shift in the peak from 1236 cm–1 in
the control to 1239 cm–1 in the G-PVP–AgNP-treated
sample. Similarly, change in the polysaccharides is also observed,
which is evident from a shift in the peak from 1064 cm–1 in the control to 1053 and 1055 cm–1 in the G-PVP–AgNPs
and PVP–AgNPs, respectively. All the results showed that the
treatment of G-PVP–AgNPs (Figure 6D) showed the alteration in the membrane
components as compared to the control (Figure 6A).

sample with the methanol extract of P. emblica (B); the treated bacterial sample with PVP–AgNPs (C); and

2.12 Scanning Electron Microscopy Confirms Membrane
Disruption by G-PVP–AgNPs
Field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis of A. baumannii bacterial cells showed an observable change in the cellular morphology
of treated bacterial samples (Figure 7) as compared to the control. The result showed that
the treatment resulted in the loss of cellular integrity and membrane
rupture, which further supports the results from other techniques
such as FTIR. The result showed that in all the treated samples, G-PVP–AgNPs
showed the best antimicrobial activity. There is complete lysis of
the bacterium after G-PVP–AgNP treatment that can be seen in
the collection of the death cell/damage membrane (Figure 7D,H).

3 Discussion
A. baumannii causes hospital-acquired
infections such as pneumonia and bloodstream infections. Carbapenem
is a last-resort antibiotics agent, and emergence of multidrug resistance,
mainly carbapenem resistance, is becoming a very serious public health
risk. Antibiotics are being used against it, but it has acquired resistance
against most of the antibiotics.21 Traditionally
used medicinal plants can be an alternative to the present therapeutics
as they do not have any side effects. These plant extracts have shown
antibacterial activity against various bacteria.22−25 In the present study, we have
explored P. emblica, M. koenigii, and O. tenuiflorum for their bioactive compounds against the carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Disc diffusion assay of A. baumannii has shown varied effects in the presence
and absence of different plant extracts. The large zone of inhibition
was observed in the methanol extract of P. emblica, while the smaller zone of inhibition was seen during treatment
with O. tenuiflorum and M. koenigii. The methanol extract of P. emblica was further investigated for growth analysis
and found that the treatment decreases the growth of the RS-307. To
validate the molecular mechanism of action, we have investigated the
production of ROS, peroxidation of lipid, carbonylation of proteins,
and leakage of the membrane. ROS estimation confirms the significant
increase in ROS production after treatment with the methanol extract
of P. emblica. ROS can cause modification
of macromolecules such as lipids and proteins, which leads to loss
of function, membrane damage, and elevated mutagenesis that leads
to bacterial death when ROS production crosses bacterium’s
detoxification and repair capability. Upregulated ROS production further
enhances lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and membrane rupture
that can be seen from increase in the leakage of reduced sugar and
DNA. Membrane damage disturbs energy production by oxidative phosphorylation
and other membrane-associated activity. To identify the active secondary
metabolite in the methanol extract responsible for ROS production,
we have performed the qualitative phytochemical screening using different
chemical methods; it identifies the presence of tannins, phenol, glycosides,
alkaloids, anthraquinone, phytosterol, coumarin, and chalcone. To
quantitate the secondary metabolite, 1D and 2D-NMR were run for this
methanol extract of P. emblica and
the result confirms the presence of the gallate derivate (ethyl gallate)
in the highest quantity. We have previously shown that the PVP–AgNPs
are active against the carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii;15 hence, we have synthesized gallate-coated
PVP–AgNPs (G-PVP–AgNPs) and tested their antimicrobial
activity. The result showed that G-PVP–AgNPs have better antimicrobial
activity than PVP–AgNPs. The molecular mechanism of these AgNPs
was also identified using biochemical assay, fluorescence microscopy,
FTIR, and TEM. The hybrid-capped G-PVP–AgNPs result in more
ROS production, lipid peroxidation, and more protein carbonylation
as compared to other antimicrobial tested ones and the control. The
result showed that there are more dead cells after G-PVP–AgNPs
(fluorescence microscopy), membrane disruption (TEM result), and change
in membrane compositions (FTIR result) as compared to other treatments
and the control. This study enlightens the role of the herbal component
of P. emblica and G-PVP–AgNPs
to control the infection of the carbapenem-resistant strain of A. baumannii and can be further explored to develop
some alternative therapeutics.

4 Conclusions
The
present study concludes that the methanol extract of the P. emblica is active against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. It was also observed that the methanol
extract of P. emblica is more effective
as compared to various other solvents used for the preparation of
the plant extracts. The present study also emphasized the significance
of G-PVP–AgNPs against multidrug-resistant A.
baumannii. It significantly enhances the ROS production
that causes leakage of the membrane, elevation in the lipid peroxidation,
and an increase in protein carbonylation in carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and hence follows an ROS-dependent killing
mechanism. Hence, the herbal-active compound (gallate) of P. emblica when tagged with AgNPs may play a significant
role to eliminate A. baumannii and
control the nosocomial infection caused by carbapenem-resistant strain
of A. baumannii.

5 Materials
and Methods
5.1 Reagents
Luria Bertani (LB) broth,
sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium chlorite, 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA),
guanidine hydrochloride, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), ethanol, nitroblue
tetrazolium (NBT), phosphate buffer, 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine (DNPH),
and methanol were purchased from HiMedia, India. Hydrochloric acid,
glycine, Tris-HCl, and NaCl were purchased from Merck, India. Ethyl
acetate, methanol, petroleum ether, and chloroform were purchased
from Fisher Scientific. Leaves of plants such as P.
emblica (identification no. RUBL211692), M. koenigii (Idt. no.: RUBL211706), and O. tenuiflorum (Idt. no. RUBL211707) were obtained
locally and identified.

5.2 Preparation of Plant Extracts
The
plant samples were collected and air-dried. Air-dried plant samples
(1 g) were used in a Soxhlet extractor using methanol, chloroform,
and petroleum-ether as solvents. The plant extracts were air-dried,
weighed, and resuspended in distilled water (for the methanol and
chloroform extracts) and distilled water with 1% DMSO (for the petroleum
ether extract).

5.3 Growth Kinetics and Disc
Diffusion Test
In the present study, pre-isolated clinical
carbapenem-resistant
strain (RS-307) of A. baumannii was
used, which is accessible in our laboratory at the Central University
of Rajasthan. MIC showed that RS-307 strain has high resistance to
carbapenems (meropenem and imipenem) and other antibiotics; hence,
they are multidrug resistant strains.6 Growth
kinetics was analyzed by taking absorbance at 605 nm at a time interval
of 30 min to check the effect of different plant extracts against A. baumannii, using a UV–vis spectrophotometer.20 Treatment of 100 μL of the plant extract
per 100 mL of bacterial culture was given at 0.4 OD. Disc diffusion
tests of different extracts of P. emblica, M. koenigii, and O. tenuiflorum were performed on RS-307 as per published
methods.20 We have tested the efficacy
of secondary metabolites of plants, extracted using different solvents
such as methanol, chloroform, and petroleum ether. Agar plates (75
mm) were prepared by mixing 2.5% LB broth with 1.5% agar. The bacterial
strain (RS-307) was inoculated in the LB agar plate and incubated
for 12–16 h at 37 °C. Discs of different plant extracts
(10 μL) were used. The pure solvents are used as controls. The
growth curve of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii for different plant extracts was also determined. Final results
were acquired by taking mean ± SEM of three aliquots, and absorbance
data are used to plot the growth curve.

5.4 Phytochemical
Screening of Plant Extracts
Using Chemical Methods
The methanol extracts of plants showed
antimicrobial activity; hence, they were analyzed for the presence
of tannins, saponins, terpenoids, chalcone, coumarins, glycosides,
cardiac glycosides, steroids, alkaloids, quinones, anthraquinone,
phenols, and anthocyanin as per our published protocol.18

5.5 Identification of Metabolites
in P. emblica Using 1D-NMR and TOCSY
2D NMR
The methanol extract of P. emblica showed the best antimicrobial activity; hence, its metabolite was
characterized by NMR. The 1H NMR spectra of the methanol
extract were recorded using a 700 MHz NMR (Agilent, USA) spectrometer
equipped with a room temperature triple-resonance probe. 1D and 2D
NMR spectra of dry extracts were carried out by dissolving the samples
in 600 μL of D2O in 5 mm NMR tubes with deuterated
trimethylsilyl propionate (TSP) in a coaxial insert as an external
reference. 1D 1H NMR spectrum with water suppression was
acquired with a single 90° pulse using a spectral width of 9124.1
Hz, a relaxation delay of 14 s, 32 K data points, an acquisition time
of 3.591 s, and 64 numbers of scans with 8 dummy scans. The free induction
decays (FIDs) were multiplied by an exponentially decaying function
prior to Fourier transformation with a line broadening of 0.3 Hz.
The 1H NMR spectra of plant extracts were manually phased,
and an automated baseline was corrected using Vnmrj 3.2A (Agilent,
USA). The 1H NMR spectra were referenced to the TSP resonance
at 0.0 ppm. To confirm the assignments, two-dimensional 1H–1H total-correlated spectroscopy (zTOCSY) was
performed. Assignments were further confirmed by comparing them with
the existing literature values, spectral library of phytochemicals,
and spectral data libraries.

5.6 Estimation of ROS via Nitro
Blue Tetrazolium
Assay
The reactive oxygen production in the bacterial cell
was estimated on a multiwell ELISA reader using the in vitro conversion
of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) to blue/purple-colored formazan crystals
via the superoxide anion as per the published method.12,20

5.7 Estimation of Lipid Peroxidation Using TBRAS
(TBA Reactive Substance) Assay
ROS causes peroxidation of
the polyunsaturated fatty acid yielding α-β-unsaturated
aldehydes such as malondialdehyde (MDA). MDA interacts with thiobarbituric
acid (TBA) and produces a pink-colored dimeric compound, quantified
by the ELISA reader.12

5.8 Estimation of Protein Carbonylation
Protein carbonyls
are created by oxidation of side chains of amino
acid. The protein carbonyl group (C=O) on oxidized amino acids
is quantified by dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) that forms a stable
dinitrophenyl (DNP) hydrazine product. The published method is used
for the estimation of protein carbonylation.20

5.9 Effect of Plant Extracts on Membrane Leakage
of Sugars and DNA
The effect of the plant extract on membrane
leakage of sugars (reducing) and DNA from the cells was quantified
using the published protocol12

5.10 Synthesis of Gallate-Coated PVP–AgNPs
and Their Antimicrobial Activity
We have previously shown
that the PVP–AgNPs are active against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.15,26 The NMR result confirms
that the gallate derivative is the most important component of the
methanol extract of P. emblica. Hence,
we have capped PVP–AgNPs with gallate as per the published
protocol.27,28 In brief, 5 mL of AgNO3 (0.01
M) was mixed with 10 mL of 2-methoxyethanol and stirred for two h
at 40–50 °C. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, 0.2 g) was added
and stirred for 10 min. This is followed by the addition of 280 μL
of 5 mM gallic acid (prepared in 25 mM NaOH) and stirring for 10 min.
The capped G-PVP–AgNPs were characterized by UV–vis
and FTIR spectroscopy. The characterized G-PVP–AgNP was also
tested for its antimicrobial activity against RS-307 using disc diffusion
assay as per our published method.12

5.11 Fluorescence Microscopy
We determined
the live/dead cells in the same treated and untreated bacterial sample
by performing fluorescence microscopy as per the published method.29 First, 1 mL of bacterial culture was harvested
by centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was
suspended in 500 μL of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. AO (27
μL, 1 mg/mL) and 50 μL PI (1 mg/mL) were added to this
solution and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature.
The solution was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was
dissolved in 100 μL of PBS. Subsequently, a thin smear (10 μL)
of this suspension was prepared on the glass slides and observed under
a fluorescence microscope using a blue filter.

5.12 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
FESEM is
a useful technique to study the morphological features
of bacteria.30 SEM analysis was performed
as per the published method.29 The bacterial
suspension were grown in LB broth until the O.D. reached 0.4, and
divided into four sets. One set was kept untreated. Other sets were
treated with 100 μL of the methanol extract of P. emblica, PVP–AgNPs, and G-PVP–AgNPs.
All the bacterial culture were incubated at 37 °C until the OD
of the control reached 1.0. Bacterial cells (4 mL, treated and untreated)
were centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The
obtained pellets were washed with 100 μL of PBS (2 times) to
remove the remaining medium before the pellets were fixed with glutaraldehyde.
A solution (100 μL) of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS (pH 7) was
added to the pellet and incubated for 2.5 h at 4 °C. The pellet
was washed with PBS, and the fixation step was repeated 2.5 h at 4 °C.
After fixation, cells were centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 15
min. The pellet was washed four times with PBS (100 μL, 15 000
rpm, 15 min) at 4 °C. Finally, 20 μL of PBS was added to
the pellet and mixed, and one drop of this suspension was placed on
the glass coverslip. The smear was allowed to air dry and then dehydrated
with ethanol gradients (35, 50, 75, 95, and 100%) and air-dried overnight.
The fixed bacterial smears were then coated with a layer of gold (Quorum),
and the conductive samples were examined with SEM (Nova NanoSEM 450).

5.13 FTIR Spectroscopy
Membrane changes
were also monitored using FTIR spectra as per the published method.29 Bacterial samples in different conditions were
fixed and dehydrated as per methods used above for SEM. The FTIR spectra
were recorded in the transmission mode by the potassium bromide (KBr)
disc method with the PerkinElmer spectrophotometer version 10.4 with
deuterated triglycine sulphate (DTGS) detector elements. The samples
pellet was mixed with potassium bromide (KBr) and grinded in a mortar
and pestle. FTIR data were recorded in the wavelength range 4000–400
cm–1. The obtained background from the KBr disc
was automatically subtracted from the prepared KBr and sample disc
spectra.

5.14 Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed
by a Student’s t-test, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. The analysis was
performed using GraphPad Prism (version 6) and Microsoft Excel.
