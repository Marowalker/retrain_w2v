The
original synthetic strategy for a new type of poly(arylene
vinylene) (PAV) is presented, where the C=C-bond-forming coupling
of bis(alkoxycarbonyldiazomethyl)aromatic compounds is utilized as
propagation. The strategy is unique in that the resulting PAVs have
an alkoxycarbonyl group as an electron-withdrawing substituent on
each vinylene carbon atom in the polymer main chain. Among the transition-metal
catalysts examined in this study, RuCl(cod)Cp* (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene,
Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) is the most efficient, affording
PAVs from a series of bis(alkoxycarbonyldiazomethyl)aromatic compounds
with a high trans-C=C-forming selectivity
of up to 90%. A PAV sample with a fluorenylene framework as an arylene
moiety prepared by the Ru catalyst exhibited a hole mobility of 4
× 10–6 cm2 V–1 s–1.

==== Body
Introduction
Polymerization using
diazocarbonyl compounds as monomers has attracted
much attention recently.1,2 In particular, Pd- and
Rh-initiated polymerization of diazoacetates has been demonstrated
to be an effective method for C–C main-chain polymer syntheses,
where the main-chain framework is constructed from one carbon unit,
alkoxycarbonylmethylene, derived from the monomer after N2 elimination. In addition to the C–C main-chain polymer syntheses,
the reactivity of diazocarbonyl groups can be utilized in the polycondensation
of bis(diazocarbonyl) compounds, which can afford a variety of unique
polymer structures (Scheme 1).3−9 For example, we have succeeded in developing a novel three-component
polycondensation of bis(diazoketone), diol or dicarboxylic acid, and
tetrahydrofuran (THF), affording a new type of poly(ether ketone)
(Scheme 1A) or poly(ester
ether ketone) (Scheme 1B), respectively.4,5 In the polycondensation, whereas
the initially anticipated propagation was the well-established Rh-catalyzed
insertion of a diazocarbonyl group into an O–H group of diol
or dicarboxylic acid, we unexpectedly found that 1 equiv of THF employed
as a solvent was inserted with its ring-opening between the diazo-bearing
carbon and the hydroxyl oxygen atoms of each bifunctional monomer,
resulting in the formation of the unique polymer main-chain structures.
Quite recently, we further applied the polycondensation to an enol
form of bis(1,3-diketone) as one of the substrates, demonstrating
that the resulting poly(β-keto enol ether)s can be efficiently
degraded into well-defined low-molecular-weight products under mildly
acidic conditions (Scheme 1C).9 In addition, we reported Ru-catalyzed
polycondensation of bis(diazocarbonyl) compounds with aromatic diamine,
affording a new type of polyamine, without the insertion of ring-opened
THF in this case (Scheme 1D).8

Scheme 1 Previous Polycondensation
of Bis(diazocarbonyl) Compounds
Meanwhile, as another mode of polycondensation of bis(diazocarbonyl)
compounds, Liu’s and our groups independently demonstrated
that C=C-forming coupling reactions of bis(diazoacetate)s can
be utilized as propagation, yielding unsaturated polyesters.6,7 In the course of investigating the C=C-forming polycondensation,
we happened to notice that, with the appropriate design of a monomer
structure, the reaction can be utilized for the preparation of poly(arylene
vinylene)s (PAVs), where an alkoxycarbonyl group (ester) as an electron-withdrawing
group (EWG) is located on each vinylene carbon atom (Scheme 2). Although the fundamental
concept of forming PAVs with phenyl-substituted vinylene carbons from
bis(diazoarene)s via C=C-forming coupling was proposed and
examined in 1969 by De Koninck and Smets to yield the products with Mn of 3000–5000,3,10 the
preparation and use of the unstable bis(diazoarene) monomers would
be somewhat troublesome, in particular compared to the relatively
stable bis(diazocarbonyl) compounds employed in this study.

Scheme 2 C=C-Bond-Forming
Coupling of Bis(alkoxycarbonyldiazomethyl)aromatic
Compounds To Afford PAV with an Alkoxycarbonyl Group on Each Vinylene
Carbon Atom
PAVs are one of the most important
π-conjugated polymers
and have been widely utilized as materials for optical and electronic
applications.11 Accordingly, the synthetic
strategy for PAV has been extensively explored, and various methods
have been achieved for preparing PAVs with a variety of chemical structures
with respect to arylene structures (Ar), cis–trans compositions,
and substituents on arylene and vinylene frameworks.11 From these studies, some general principles for improving
properties of PAVs have been established, and one of them is the introduction
of EWGs on vinylene carbon atoms. Indeed, poly(phenylene vinylene)s
(PPVs) with EWGs on their vinylene carbon atoms have recently been
demonstrated to exhibit extremely high electron mobility (>1 cm2 V–1 s–1),12,13 to which the high planarity of the π-conjugation systems in
the polymer structures could contribute the most though. However,
to the best of our knowledge, a general synthetic method for incorporating
EWGs (e.g., CN, F, CO2R) on all of the vinylene carbons
in PAV has not been achieved so far and has remained an unrealized
objective. In this context, our new synthetic strategy proposed in Scheme 2 is quite promising
as a method for realizing the substitution pattern of vinylene carbons.
Furthermore, another advantage of this method is the latitude in the
choice of the Ar structures because practically any bis(halomethyl)aromatic
compound can be transformed into its corresponding bis(alkoxycarbonyldiazomethyl)aromatic
compound as a monomer for the polymerization.

In this paper,
we will report the preparation of a series of bis(alkoxycarbonyldiazomethyl)aromatic
compounds and attempt to polymerize the monomers with transition metal
catalysts for preparing a new type of PAV. In addition, some photophysical
properties of the resulting polymers will be reported.

Results and Discussion
Model
Reaction Using Methyl 2-Diazo-2-phenylacetate (1)
As a model reaction for the polycondensation to obtain
PAVs from bis(alkoxycarbonyldiazomethyl)aromatic compounds, we chose
a transition-metal-catalyzed C=C-forming coupling reaction
of methyl 2-diazo-2-phenylacetate (1) (Scheme 3). As transition metal catalysts,
we first employed Cu(acac)2 and Rh2(OAc)4, which have been reported to be effective for the coupling
reactions of diazocarbonyl compounds such as diazoketones, diazoacetates,
and diazomalonates.7,14,15 For example, when 1 was reacted with Cu(acac)2 with a feed ratio of [1]/[Cu] = 50 in CH2Cl2 at room temperature (RT), the desired coupling products
were obtained as a mixture of cis-2 and trans-2 in a ratio of [cis-2]/[trans-2] = 5:3 in
high yield (run 1 in Table 1), where each isomer was identified according to the data
reported in the literature.16 The 1H NMR spectrum of the isolated product mixture revealed the
presence of another minor compound, whose MeO signal appeared at a
different chemical shift than the corresponding signals for cis-2 and trans-2. According to the literatures,17−19 the structure of the
compound was revealed to be azine 3 containing an =N–N=
framework between two units derived from 1 as a result
of a coupling reaction with the release of only 1 equiv of N2 from two molecules of 1; the content of 3 was determined to be 12 mol % based on relative signal intensities
in the 1H NMR spectrum. A significant decrease in the 3 content was observed in the reaction in toluene, particularly
at 100 °C, down to 2% (runs 2 and 3 in Table 1). It was interesting to note that when Rh2(OAc)4 was used as a catalyst in place of Cu(acac)2 under the same conditions, while the product mixture was
obtained in high yield (>90%), the main product was azine 3 (runs 4–6 in Table 1) and the selectivity of the products was highly dependent
on the solvent employed for the reaction (CH2Cl2 or toluene) as well.

As for Ru complexes as a catalyst,
whereas Grubbs catalysts were
effective for the analogous polycondensation of bis(diazoacetate)s
having H at their diazo-bearing carbons to yield unsaturated polyesters
via C=C-forming coupling in our previous publication,7 the Grubbs first catalyst did not efficiently
catalyze the coupling of 1, probably because the reactivity
of diazoacetates considerably differs depending on the substituent
(H or Ph) at their diazo-bearing carbons; while the catalyst gave
a complex mixture at room temperature in CH2Cl2, the product was obtained in moderate yield (45%) at 100 °C
in toluene (runs 7 and 8 in Table 1). In the meantime, because we have found that RuCl(cod)Cp
(cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene, Cp = cyclopentadienyl) can catalyze the
coupling of 1 efficiently under a certain condition in
the literature,20 we employed a more convenient
and commercially available Ru complex with a similar structure, RuCl(cod)Cp*
(Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), for the model reaction. As listed
in runs 9 and 10 in Table 1, while the reaction in CH2Cl2 at room
temperature gave the products in moderate yield (57%) with high trans-C=C selectivity (87%), both the yield and trans-C=C selectivity improved significantly in 1,2-dichlorethane
as the solvent at 60 °C to 88 and 96%, respectively. The high trans-C=C selectivity was retained when the reaction
was conducted in toluene at 100 °C, although the yield became
moderate (57%) (run 11 in Table 1). It is noteworthy that the azine 3 formation
was suppressed to 2 mol % in these RuCl(cod)Cp*-catalyzed reactions.
The results for the model reaction described above indicated that
with the appropriate choice of the catalyst and reaction conditions,
it would be possible to prepare well-defined PAVs having an alkoxycarbonyl
group at each vinylene carbon atom by single-component polycondensation
of bis(alkoxycarbonyldiazomethyl)aromatic compounds.

Monomer Syntheses
Syntheses of bis(alkoxycarbonyldiazomethyl)aromatic
compounds employed as monomers in this study are outlined in Scheme 4 and Scheme S1. By a three-step process, the starting
bis(halomethyl)aromatic compounds were transformed into bis(alkoxycarbonylmethyl)aromatic
compounds, which were then subjected to a diazo-transfer reaction
to yield a series of monomers with biphenylene (4a and 4b), phenylene (5), and di(n-octyl)fluorenylene (6) frameworks as the aromatic moieties.
In each monomer structure, linear alkyl side chains (C6, C8, or C12)
were incorporated for improving the solubility of the resulting polymers.

Polymerization of Bis(alkoxycarbonyldiazomethyl)aromatic
Compounds
RuCl(cod)Cp*-Catalyzed Polymerization
With the use
of RuCl(cod)Cp* exhibiting high trans-C=C
selectivity in the aforementioned model reaction, we first examined
the polymerization of a biphenyl-type monomer 4a to optimize
the reaction conditions (runs 1 and 2 in Table 2 and Scheme 5). While the reaction of 4a with RuCl(cod)Cp*
in CH2Cl2 (room temperature) or in toluene (room
temperature and 50 °C) gave ill-defined polymeric products in
low yield in contrast to the successful results of the model reactions
at these temperatures, increasing the reaction temperature to 100
°C in toluene turned out to be effective for affording a relatively
well-defined polymer in a feed ratio of [4a]/[Ru] = 25
(run 1 in Table 2).
In the 1H NMR spectrum of the product in run 1 (Figure S1), a predominant signal for −CO2CH2– in the alkoxycarbonyl
moiety appears corresponding to the trans-C=C
framework based on the comparison with the spectrum of the model reaction
products 2. However, along with the signals assignable
to cis-C=C and azine frameworks, there exist
some other unassignable minor signals in this region. After examining
various reaction conditions to improve the polymerization behavior,
we have found that increasing the amount of the catalyst with respect
to 4a is crucial for obtaining more well-defined polymers
in this polymerization. Thus, the reaction with a feed ratio of [4a]/[Ru] = 10 was conducted in toluene at 100 °C (run
2 in Table 2), and
the 1H NMR spectrum of the product (size-exclusion chromatography
(SEC)-estimated Mn = 20 800) obtained
in 51% yield is shown in Figure 1. In contrast to the spectrum of the product in run
1, the intensities of unidentified signals except for −CO2CH2– signals of trans- (4.0 ppm) and cis-C=C (4.2
ppm) and azine (4.4 ppm) frameworks became diminished, and the composition
of the three components could be calculated based on the relative
signal intensities to be cis/trans /azine = 6:90:4. Likewise, the polymerization of 4b with a longer ester substituent (n-dodecyl) proceeded
to give a relatively well-defined polymer in a lower yield of 25%
with a slightly diminished trans-C=C selectivity
(87%) (run 3 in Table 2; 1H NMR spectrum in Figure S2). When phenylene-bridged 2,6-bis(n-hexyloxycarbonyldiazomethyl)benzene 5 was employed as a monomer, the same reaction condition as
the above afforded a relatively well-defined polymer despite a lower trans-C=C selectivity (84%) (run 4 in Table 2; 1H NMR spectrum
in Figure S3). The polymerization of the
monomer 6 with a di-n-octyl-substituted
fluorenylene framework gave a polymer in 67% yield with high trans-C=C selectivity (90%) (run 5 in Table 2). Along with the 1H NMR analysis (Figure 2), the polymer structure including the azine composition was confirmed
from the elemental analysis results in this case; the expected values
calculated based on the (cis + trans)/azine ratio determined from the 1H NMR spectrum is C
80.36, H 9.92, and N 0.23, which agreed well with the observed values
of C 79.02, H 9.37, and N 0.50. These results demonstrate that the
polycondensation with the Ru catalyst can indeed afford PAVs with
an alkoxycarbonyl group on each vinylene carbon atom with a relatively
high trans-C=C selectivity, although a small
amount of azine framework exists in the polymer main chain.

Even
though we have succeeded in obtaining relatively well-defined trans-C=C-rich PAVs from the Ru-catalyzed polycondensation,
the products contained the azine framework and unidentified structural
defects even, to a small extent, in the main chain, which would bring
about a moderate performance in the hole mobility measurement for
a polymer sample obtained from 6 described in a later
section below.

Cu(acac)2- and Rh2(OAc)4-Catalyzed
Polymerization
In a manner similar to that observed in the
previous section of RuCl(cod)Cp*-catalyzed reactions, the polymerization
of 4a with Cu(acac)2 in CH2Cl2 at room temperature, which was a suitable condition for the
model reaction of 1, did not afford a well-defined polymer.
However, the use of toluene as a solvent at 100 °C again was
quite effective to give relatively well-defined polymers with the
catalyst. As shown in run 6 in Table 2, the reaction with a feed ratio of [4a]/[Cu] = 25 afforded a high-molecular-weight polymer with Mn = 56 800 in moderate yield (63%). As
clearly observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of the product
(Figure 3A), the selectivities
of cis- and trans-C=C (41
and 48%, respectively) were low, as expected from the results in the
model reaction of 1 (run 3 in Table 1), while the composition of the azine framework
(11%) is higher in the polymerization than that observed in the model
reaction (2%). The increase of the amount of the catalyst to [4a]/[Cu] = 10 resulted in both a higher Mn (90 800) and a higher trans selectivity (55%),
despite the lower polymer yield (35%) (run 7 in Table 2). Phenylene-bridged monomer 5 was also polymerized under the same conditions to give polymers
with a lower Mn, yield, and trans-C=C selectivity (runs 8 and 9 in Table 2 and Figure S4) compared to the polymerization of 4a. Interestingly,
Rh2(OAc)4-catalyzed polymerization of 4a in CH2Cl2 at room temperature afforded
a high Mn polymer (Mn = 40 000), where the azine framework is predominant
(selectivity = 79%, run 10 in Table 2 and Figure 3B) in accordance with the result of the model reaction.

Optoelectronic Properties of PAVs with a Fluorenylene Framework
Preliminary measurements were carried out to estimate the optoelectronic
properties of PAV (poly6′) with a fluorenylene
framework obtained from 6. Figure 4 shows UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of a poly6′ sample (Mn = 10 900, Mw/Mn = 1.73) in a CHCl3 solution (10
mg/L) (a) and in the film state (b). In the solution, compared with
the reported data of a conventional poly(9,9-dialkylfluorenylene-2,7-vinylene)
(PFV) with unsubstituted olefinic double bonds,21 a significant blue-shift (45 nm) was observed in the UV–vis
spectrum of poly6′ [absorption maximum (λmax) = 345 nm], which indicated that the steric hindrance of
alkoxycarbonyl groups and/or structural defects may impede the coplanar
structure of the backbone or decrease the effective π-conjugation
length. In addition, a significantly red-shifted emission (540 nm
of emission maximum) was observed in the poly6′ solution compared with that in the PFV solution (450 nm of emission
maximum), resulting in a much larger Stokes shift of poly6′ [195 nm (poly6′) vs 60 nm (PFV)]. This larger
Stokes shift of poly6′ could be ascribed to the
significant conformational change in an excited state in the solution,
resulting in variations in the twist angle between neighboring fluorene
rings.22

Figure 4 UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence
spectra of PAV obtained
from 6 by RuCl(cod)Cp* (Mn = 10 900, Mw/Mn = 1.73) in a CHCl3 solution (10 mg/L, λex = 345 nm) (a) and the film state (b).

As for the UV–vis absorption spectrum in the film state
(Figure 4b), no bathochromic
shift was observed (λmax = 345 nm) in comparison
with the solution state, suggesting that polymer-chain aggregation
was restricted in the solution owing to the long alkyl chains both
in fluorenylene and ester moieties. A blue emission peak (425 nm of
emission maximum) with shoulders derived from vibronic bands was observed
in the film state, and the Stokes shift (80 nm) was similar to that
of the conventional PFV (60 nm).

Since semiconducting materials
have been applied to electroluminescent
and photovoltaic devices in a diode geometry, it is important to evaluate
their mobility in the direction perpendicular to the substrate. As
the results of such a mobility evaluation for the poly6′ sample, Figure S5 shows current density
(J)–voltage (V) curves for
a hole-only device with the configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS)/PAV/Au (a) and their log–log plots (b); in the
latter plot, as expected, regions with a slope of 2 were observed
for all devices examined. Therefore, the space-charge-limited current
(SCLC) mobility of poly6′ was estimated to be
4 × 10–6 cm2 V–1 s–1 (the mean value for three devices). Although
this value was lower than those reported for regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene)23 and its homologues,24 it was in the same order of conventional poly(dialkoxy-p-phenylene vinylene).25 More importantly,
the relatively low planarity in the structure of poly6′ could be the critical reason for the low hole mobility, in comparison
to the reported much higher mobility of polymers with high planarity.12,13 With the higher structural integrity achieved on the PAV framework
and the higher planarity imparted with the appropriate design of monomer
structures, we can expect a significant improvement in the photophysical
properties of the PAVs prepared by this new synthetic strategy.26

Conclusions
We have succeeded in
establishing a new synthetic method for PAVs
bearing an alkoxycarbonyl group on each vinylene carbon atom, utilizing
transition-metal-catalyzed C=C-forming coupling reactions of
a series of bis(alkoxycarbonyldiazomethyl)aromatic compounds. In particular,
we have demonstrated that the Ru-catalyzed polymerization can afford
PAVs with high trans-C=C selectivity. The
synthetic strategy for PAVs is totally new, and the resulting polymer
structures cannot be prepared by any other synthetic method for PAVs
reported so far. Furthermore, because the presence of EWG groups on
the vinylene carbon atoms in PAV has been reported to enhance the
photophysical performances and since there is high latitude in the
arylene structure variation, the method could bring about new PAV-based
polymeric materials, although the PAV obtained from 6 showed moderate hole mobility at present. Further investigation
for improving the structural integrity of the PAVs and evaluating
properties of the resulting polymers for a variety of applications
is underway in our groups.

Synthesis
Di-n-hexyl 4,4′-Biphenylenediacetate
Under
a N2 atmosphere, a toluene (50 mL) solution of
4,4′-biphenylenediacetic acid (3.41 g, 12.6 mmol), 1-hexanol
(4.0 mL, 32 mmol), and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (5.8 mL, 30 mmol)
was placed in a round-bottomed flask equipped with a dropping funnel.
After a toluene (35 mL) solution of triphenylphosphine (7.96 g, 30.3
mmol) was added dropwise from the dropping funnel, the reaction mixture
was stirred overnight at room temperature. To remove the resulting
triphenylphosphine oxide as an insoluble salt, MgCl2 (5.77
g, 60.6 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at 60
°C. The resulting solid was removed by filtration, and the filtrate
was washed with H2O and dried over Na2SO4. After Na2SO4 was removed by filtration,
volatiles were removed from the solution by evaporation under reduced
pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography with

azodicarboxylate (5.2 mL, 27 mmol) was placed in a round-bottomed
flask equipped with a dropping funnel. After a toluene (16 mL) solution
of triphenylphosphine (6.98 g, 26.6 mmol) was added dropwise from
the dropping funnel, the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at
room temperature. After volatiles were removed under reduced pressure,
MgCl2 (5.77 g, 60.6 mmol) and toluene (45 mL) were added
and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at 60 °C. The resulting solid
was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was washed with H2O and dried over Na2SO4. After Na2SO4 was removed by filtration, volatiles were removed
from the solution by evaporation under reduced pressure. The residue
was purified by silica gel chromatography with CHCl3 as
an eluent to give the product in 57% yield as a colorless solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 7.54 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 4H, Ph–H), 7.35 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H, Ph–H), 4.10 (t, J = 6.6 Hz, 4H, −CO2–CH2−), 3.65 (s, 4H, Ph–CH2–CO2), 1.62 (q, J =

Model Reaction Procedure
A typical
procedure for the
model reaction of 1 using RuCl(cod)Cp* (run 11 in Table 1) as a catalyst is
described as follows: Under a N2 atmosphere, RuCl(cod)Cp*
(8.1 mg, 0.021 mmol) and 1 (74.9 mg, 0.425 mmol) were
placed in a Schlenk tube. After toluene (4.3 mL) was added to the
mixture, it was heated to 100 °C and stirred for 17 h at the
temperature. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, a 1
N HCl aqueous solution (10 mL), a 1 N HCl/MeOH solution (10 mL), and
CHCl3 (15 mL) were added, and the organic layer was separated
using a separatory funnel. The organic layer was washed with the 1
N HCl aqueous solution (50 mL) and saturated NaCl aqueous solution
(50 mL) and dried over Na2SO4. After the volatiles
were removed under reduced pressure from the organic layer, the residue
was purified using preparative SEC with CHCl3 as an eluent
to give the product as a mixture of cis, trans, and azine forms. The
composition of the cis/trans/azine form was determined by 1H NMR analysis to be 4:94:2. The yield (57%) was calculated from
the equation of 100 × [weight of PhCO2(Me)C in all
of the products]/[weight of PhCO2(Me)C in the starting 1].

Polymerization Procedure
As a typical
example, the
polymerization procedure for run 5 in Table 2 is described as follows. Under a N2 atmosphere, RuCl(cod)Cp* (15.3 mg, 0.0403 mmol) and 6 (0.294 g, 0.0403 mmol) were placed in a Schlenk tube. Toluene (8.1
mL) was added at room temperature, and the resulting solution was
heated at 100 °C for 17 h. After the mixture was cooled to room
temperature, a 1 N HCl/MeOH solution (10 mL), a 1 N HCl aqueous solution
(10 mL), and CHCl3 (15 mL) were added, and the mixture
was transferred to a separatory funnel to separate the organic layer.
The aqueous layer was extracted with CHCl3 trice (total
amount of CHCl3 was 60 mL), and the combined organic layer
was washed with the 1 N HCl aqueous solution (50 mL) and saturated
NaCl solution (50 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and
concentrated under reduced pressure. The residual solid was subjected
to purification by preparative SEC using CHCl3 as an eluent
to afford the product in 67% yield.

Measurements
The
number-average molecular weight (Mn) and
polydispersity ratio [weight-average
molecular weight/number-average molecular weight (Mw/Mn)] were measured by means
of SEC on a Jasco-ChromNAV system equipped with a differential refractometer
detector using THF as eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 40 °C,
calibrated with six poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) standards (Shodex
M-75; Mp = 2400–212 000, Mw/Mn < 1.1) and
dibutyl sebacate (molecular weight = 314.5). The columns used for
the SEC analyses were a combination of Styragel HR4 and HR2 (Waters;
exclusion limit molecular weight = 600 and 20 kDa for polystyrene,
respectively; column size = 300 mm × 7.8 mm i.d.; average particle
size = 5 μm). Purification by preparative SEC was performed
on a JAI LC-918R equipped with a combination of columns of JAIGEL-3H
and JAIGEL-2H (Japan Analytical Industry; exclusion limit molecular
weight = 70 and 5 kDa for polystyrene, respectively; column size =
600 mm × 20 mm i.d.) using CHCl3 as the eluent at
a flow rate of 3.8 mL/min at room temperature. 1H (400
MHz) and 13C (100 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
Avance 400 spectrometer at room temperature (monomers) or at 50 °C
(polymers). Elemental analysis was performed on YANAKO CHN Corder
MT-5. UV–vis absorption spectra for PAV were obtained on a
JASCO V560 or V-570 spectrophotometer, and photoluminescence (PL)
spectra were obtained on a JASCO FP-6500 or FP8300 spectrophotometer
with an excitation at the absorption maximum for a chloroform solution
and for the film state. The film was fabricated via a spin-coating
process using a chloroform solution (10 mg/mL) on a quartz plate.
Hole-only devices with the configuration of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate)
(40 nm)/PAV (150 nm) (run 5 in Table 2)/Au (100 nm) were fabricated with 0.1 cm2 of the active layer. All of the spin-coating processes and current
density–voltage measurements were carried out at room temperature
in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere for three devices utilizing
a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter. The hole mobility was determined with eq 1, taking the series resistance
(20 Ω) into consideration and assuming that the built-in voltage
is close to zero due to the small difference of work functions for
both electrodes 1  where J is the hole current
density, μh the hole mobility, εr the relative permittivity of the material (3.0), ε0 the permittivity of vacuum, L the thickness of
the active layer (650–700 nm), and V the voltage
drop across the device.

Since poly6′ possesses
electron-withdrawing alkoxy carbonyl groups, it is expected to exhibit
superior electron transporting properties rather than hole transport.
Indeed, although we fabricated electron-only devices with the configuration
of ITO/Al/poly6′ (150 nm)/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al, no
SCLC characteristics were observed in J–V profiles resulting in the failure of evaluation of electron
mobility. Thus, the alternation of the device configuration and the
use of other methods for mobility measurements are under consideration.
