A purely
DNA nanomachine must support internal stresses across
short DNA segments with finite rigidity, producing effects that can
be qualitatively very different from experimental observations of
isolated DNA in fixed-force ensembles. In this article, computational
simulations are used to study how well the rigidity of a driving DNA
duplex can rupture a double-stranded DNA target into single-stranded
segments and how well this stress can discriminate between unzipping
or shearing geometries. This discrimination is found to be maximized
at an optimal length but deteriorates as the driving duplex is either
lengthened or shortened. This differs markedly from a fixed-force
ensemble and has implications for the design parameters and limitations
of dynamic DNA nanomachines.

1 Introduction
DNA is emerging as a programmable
and versatile material for nanoengineering,1,2 with
techniques such as DNA origami allowing for a rich variety
of geometries and structures,3 as well
as dynamic transitions between structures that are kinetically controlled
via toehold-mediated strand displacement. A variety of nanostructures
have been built with DNA, including track-walking motors4−17 and nanorobots with Boolean logic control,18 with the potential to sense and manipulate intracellular environments.19

Alongside toehold-mediated strand displacement,
DNA duplex rupture
and re-formation is ideal for dynamically switching a DNA nanostructure
between different states, with the process capable of storing or releasing
up to 10 pN nm of chemical energy per base pair.20 Investigating the mechanics of force-induced rupture is
thus vital for developing DNA nanomachines, as well as for the wider
understanding of DNA mechanics in general.

In particular, DNA
requires two to three times more force to rupture
when force is applied across opposite ends of the duplex, in a shearing
geometry, as opposed to when forces are applied to the same end of
the duplex to unzip it instead.21−23 This difference has been used
to distinguish between energetically and kinetically identical but
geometrically different arrangements of DNA molecules.24 The shearing–unzipping difference has
also been used to implement selective dissociation between identical
legs of DNA bipedal nanowalkers.14,15

Such
purely geometric discrimination in turn suggests that a DNA
nanostructure could exhibit allosteric interactions, where binding
to one part of the structure affects the energetics of a different
part. This was recently demonstrated by a modular nanowalker which
binds its rear foot in an unzipping geometry and its front foot in
a shearing geometry14,16 so that with both feet bound
to the track, intramolecular tension preferentially unbinds the rear
foot, achieving continuous forward movement without irreversible track
damage.

Various theoretical and experimental approaches are
used to study
force-induced DNA rupture. Theoretically, the rupture of long duplexes
can be treated as first-order thermodynamic transitions induced by
sufficient force, 15–20 pN for unzipping21,22,25−27 and 60–70 pN
for shearing.23 However, the rupture of
shorter DNA duplexes is of greater relevance to nanostructures. For
such duplexes, rupture instead proceeds as an activated process whose
rate is determined by the height of the transition barrier, as recently
modeled.28

Experimentally, in most
measurements of rupture forces, the DNA
molecule being studied is coupled to a larger system (e.g., the tip
of an atomic force microscope), which applies a constant force. Rupture
thus occurs over an isotensional or Gibbs ensemble.29,30 By contrast, consider a DNA duplex with two “sticky ends”
that, upon hybridizing, compress the duplex and reduce its average
end-to-end distance, as shown in Figure 1. The reverse of this process corresponds
to the stress in the main DNA duplex, rupturing the sticky ends apart
either by unzipping or shearing. These seem at first glance to be
nanomechanical analogues to constant force shearing and unzipping,
but there is a vital difference: the tension in the main DNA duplex,
and therefore the shearing or unzipping force, decreases as the duplex
is allowed to relax into a less constrained state. Because of the
finite elasticity of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, the
process therefore no longer occurs at constant force. Furthermore,
because a duplex is generally longer than it is wide, a helix being
sheared will generally experience different forces from a helix being
unzipped, as well as the point of first contact being different. This
is true rather generally for DNA shearing or unzipping that occurs
within a DNA nanomachine. This study aims to clarify how this affects
the energetics of shearing and unzipping, as well as the difference
between them, which has implications for constructing DNA nanomachinery.

Figure 1 As a short
duplex DNA target attached to a longer main duplex (a,
b) undergoes either unzipping (c) or shearing (d) to release single
strands (e, f), the curvature and tension in the main duplex decreases.
The different parts of each configuration are color-coded as follows:
the main duplex is blue and red, whereas the overhangs are composed
of green sticky ends that are complementary and come together to form
the target duplex and purple linkers that provide mechanical flexibility.
Configurations are shown for the main duplex length of 40 bp.

2 Results
2.1 DNA Systems
In this study, the nucleotide-level
coarse-grained model oxDNA231−33 (parameterized to 1 M salt concentration)
is used to simulate configurations shown in Figure 1, in which the stress across a double-stranded
DNA main duplex of varying length is applied to either shear or unzip
a duplex of 10 base pairs. The oxDNA2 model accurately represents
the elastic properties of single and double-stranded DNA, together
with the basic physics of base pairing. Despite treating each nucleotide
as a rigid body, the oxDNA2 model has been useful in clarifying basic
aspects of key processes, such as hybridization,34 toehold-mediated strand displacement,35 hairpin formation,36 duplex
strong bending and kinking,37−39 and force-induced melting and
overstretching.40 Instead of a specific
sequence, sequence-averaged parameters are used for the nucleotide
interaction potentials to exclude effects such as misbonding and the
difference between A–T and C–G pair interaction strengths.

The molecular configurations consist of double-stranded DNA, between
20 and 60 base pairs long, with 15-nucleotide single strands added
to either the 3′ and 5′ ends of one strand or the 3′
ends of both strands. In the former configuration, when the 10 terminal
nucleotides on the single strands are hydrogen-bonded, they form a
10 base pair DNA duplex with unzipping stresses applied across one
3′–5′ end and two segments of 5-nucleotide single-stranded
DNA left unbonded as linkers. In the latter configuration, the central
duplex instead has shearing stresses applied at its 5′ ends.
Both configurations evolve without external forces so that the unzipping
or shearing forces come strictly from the stress of compressing the
longer double-stranded DNA bridge.

Given the large free-energy
changes expected, direct observation
of rupture kinetics would be computationally demanding. As such, kinetics
and energetics are instead inferred from free-energy landscapes of
the shearing and unzipping processes. The virtual-move Monte Carlo
(VMMC) algorithm of Whitelam and Geissler (the variant from the appendix
of ref (41)) is used
to simulate the model, and the free-energy profile is measured as
a function of the reaction coordinate, either how many pair bonds
remain along the target 10 bp duplex or the distance between the separated
single strands, taken as the minimum of all distances between pairs
of complementary nucleotides, in 0.85 nm bins (corresponding to 1
distance unit in the oxDNA2 model). Umbrella sampling42 and windowing based on the reaction coordinate is then
used to further reduce the computational difficulty of accessing high-free-energy
states and measuring their free energy accurately.

2.2 Energetic Features of Shearing and Unzipping
The free-energy
landscapes for shearing and unzipping are shown
in Figure 2. Both shearing
and unzipping show qualitatively similar landscapes, with a monotonically
increasing free-energy curve for bond-breaking leading to a reaction
barrier at the state of highest free energy, which is always the state
with exactly one pair bond remaining. As shown in Figure 3a, we define the transition
barrier ΔG‡ to be the free-energy
difference between the 10-bond state and the one-bond reaction barrier
state. After that last bond is broken, the free energy decreases again
to a minimum at which both the main duplex and the sticky ends are
in fully relaxed configurations, before rising again when the distance
between sticky ends is large enough to require elastic stretching.
We define the overall free-energy difference ΔGtot to be the free-energy difference between the 10-bond
state and the subsequent free-energy minimum over the ruptured configurations,
which is negative if the 10-bond state has lower free energy than
the ruptured free-energy minimum, indicating that rupture is energetically
unfavorable and positive otherwise. The transition barrier and overall
free-energy difference, respectively, control kinetic and energetic
contributions to the relative rates of shearing and unzipping.

Figure 2 As (a) unzipping
or (b) shearing progresses, the free energy increases
due to bond-breaking up until the reaction barrier, which is consistently
the state with only one bond remaining. After this barrier is passed,
the free energy steadily decreases to a relaxed minimum and only increases
again when the distance between sticky ends is forced to be larger
than the contour length of the main duplex. Free-energy curves are
for main duplex lengths of (top to bottom) 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50,
and 60 bp and are offset by 5 kBT from each other at 0 bonds for clarity. Insets show characteristic
configurations with either all 10 pair bonds intact, only one bond
remaining, or completely unbound. Uncertainties are comparable to
or smaller than the size of the symbols.

Figure 3 (a) For either shearing or unzipping (shown here for main duplex
length 30 bp), the transition barrier ΔG‡ and ΔGtot can be
defined by the free energy of the transition state (1 bond) and the
minimum free energy of the unbound states, respectively, relative
to the initial 10-bond state. Cut-outs on the right correspond to
insets in graphs (b), depicting the derivation of these free energies
graphically. (b) The transition barrier (top) remains largely constant
for shearing and shows a minimum of around 30 bp for unzipping; the
total free-energy change (bottom) mostly decreases with increasing
main duplex length. These can be fitted to eqs 1 and 2 of Section 2.4, where allowing
the main duplex to kink at a critical torque of 29 pN nm (solid lines)
improves fitting of the transition barrier but degrades fitting of
the total free-energy difference of unzipping, relative to a model
in which the main duplex does not kink (dashed lines).

The variation in ΔG‡ and
ΔGtot according to the length of
the main duplex is shown in Figure 3b. At any main duplex length, both ΔG‡ and ΔGtot are
higher for shearing than for unzipping. As the main duplex length
increases, ΔGtot decreases both
for shearing and for unzipping until about 40 bp, after which it remains
roughly constant, becoming negative for unzipping whereas remaining
positive for shearing. Rupture is thus less energetically favorable
with shorter main duplexes than longer main duplexes and less favorable
for shearing than for unzipping; indeed, after 30 bp, unzipping becomes
energetically favored, whereas shearing remains disfavored. On the
other hand, ΔG‡ is consistently
24–25 kBT for
shearing regardless of the main duplex length but varies nonmonotonically
for unzipping, being minimized at 14 kBT for a 30 bp main duplex, whereas rising as high
as 19 kBT for either
shorter or longer main duplexes.

These trends can be qualitatively
explained by considering the
molecular geometries of shearing and unzipping. Because our systems
require the same number of base pairs to be broken for shearing and
unzipping, any difference in ΔG‡ between them captures the difference in how the main duplex relaxes
during the rupturing of the target duplex. Thus, the insensitivity
of ΔG‡ to main duplex length
for shearing shows that the shearing of the target duplex does not
allow the main duplex to relax. This is consistent with the molecular
geometry of shearing, in which rupturing one base pair bond simply
replaces one (double-stranded) base pair under tension with one (single-stranded)
nucleotide’s worth of length. Indeed, the end-to-end distance
across the main duplex changes minimally as shearing proceeds (Figure 4), with most of the
relaxation occurring after the target duplex has been fully ruptured.

Figure 4 (a) (i)
As either shearing or unzipping proceeds (shown for main
duplex length 40 bp), the end-to-end distance across the main duplex
increases as it relaxes, whereas the contour length increases slightly
at either high bond number or high min distance. (Here and in Figure 5, error bars are
in-run fluctuations; the standard error of mean is the size of the
symbols or smaller.) The inset shows how contour length (solid) and
end-to-end distance (dashed) are calculated for a typical configuration.
The end-to-end distance is extracted at 10 bonds, one bond, and the
unbound energy minimum for subsequent analysis, with the cutout corresponding
to the inset in graph (ii). Graph (ii) shows how the end-to-end length
increases as shearing and unzipping proceed. (b) (i) The melting of
base pairs in the main duplex results in either kinking or fraying.
Graphs (ii) and (iii) show how kinking and fraying, respectively,
decrease as shearing and unzipping proceed. In graphs (a) (ii), (b)
(ii), and (b) (iii), solid lines show the relaxation from the 10-bond
state to the one bond state and dashed lines show the subsequent relaxation
to the fully relaxed unbound state; unzipping data points are shifted
1 bp right for clarity.

By contrast, unzipping the target duplex releases two nucleotides
under tension per base pair broken, allowing the end-to-end distance
across the main duplex to decrease by as much as 6 nm (Figure 4). The transition barrier ΔG‡ is thus significantly lower for unzipping
than for shearing, owing to the main duplex relaxation. The minimized
ΔG‡ for a 30 bp main duplex
suggests that unzipping relaxation is maximized at this length. A
shorter main duplex length has a shorter final end-to-end distance
to relax to, reducing the relaxation and increasing ΔG‡, whereas a longer main duplex remains
substantially curved even after unzipping, again increasing ΔG‡. The results for longer duplexes are
consistent with experiments on molecular vises and point to either
buckling or kinking of the main duplex.

The overall free-energy
change ΔGtot includes the cost of
bringing the sticky ends into first contact,
unlike the transition barrier ΔG‡. Two effects compete as the main duplex length increases: the effective
local concentration of the sticky ends decreases, increasing the cost
of the first contact, but the increasing mechanical flexibility of
the main duplex decreases the cost of the first contact. The observed
decrease in ΔGtot as the main duplex
length increases suggests that the second effect predominates at shorter
lengths, later being canceled out as the length of the main duplex
increases past 40 bp.

2.3 Length Changes and Stacking
Disruptions Accompanying
Relaxation
The physical factors underlying the energetics
of shearing and unzipping were further elucidated by characterizing
simulation configurations according to two sets of characteristics,
as shown in Figures 4a and 4b. For each configuration, the contour
length and end-to-end distance of the main duplex were measured. In
addition, a large enough stress can disrupt base pairing and stacking
in the duplex, either fraying it at either end or kinking it at a
base pair in its interior (as depicted in Figure 4b(i) and (ii), respectively). Thus, geometric
criteria were also used to determine if kinking or fraying had disrupted
stacking in the main duplex.

Figure 5 End-to-end length and contour length of the
5 nt single-stranded
linker is consistently longer for unzipping than for shearing, showing
the consistently higher tension throughout the structure during unzipping
until the configuration is fully unbound and even for some small distance
after. The consistent contour length decrease during unzipping indicates
the recovery of base stacking, which may further decrease the energy
cost of unzipping (the main duplex length is 40 bp; other lengths
result in similar data).

For each configuration, the midpoint of each base pair in
the main
duplex was located; the contour length was calculated as the sum of
distances between each consecutive base pair midpoint along the duplex,
whereas the end-to-end distance was calculated as the straight-line
distance from the first base pair midpoint to the last. Trends in
contour length and end-to-end distance as unzipping or shearing proceeds
are shown in Figure 4a(i). Contour length increases slightly either in high-bond states
or high min distance states, which can be attributed to kinking and
fraying in the former cases and to elastic stretching in the latter.

More importantly, the end-to-end distance shows noticeable differences
between shearing and unzipping. The initial distance (at 10 bonds)
is much shorter for unzipping, reflecting the difference in orientation
because the width of the target duplex (∼2 nm) is shorter than
its length (∼3.3 nm). As seen in Figure 4a(ii), this persists for all main duplex
lengths. However, unzipping steadily increases the end-to-end distance
even during partial rupture of the target duplex, whereas the end-to-end
distance remains roughly constant throughout shearing until the target
duplex is fully ruptured. Thus, during shearing, most of the stress
in the main duplex is relaxed only after the transition barrier, whereas
some of that stress is released prebarrier during unzipping. This
is consistent with the unzipping transition barrier being consistently
lower than the shearing transition barrier, as noted earlier. Also,
the total relaxation of the main duplex increases with increasing
main duplex length, consistent with the reduction in total free-energy
change (Figure 3b).
The total relaxation is also always larger for unzipping than shearing,
consistent with the total free-energy change being less for unzipping.

For each configuration, kinking and fraying were also detected
via disruption of stacking. In oxDNA, the unit vectors ai and ai+1 encoding the orientation of neighboring nucleotides i and i + 1 are approximately parallel
when the nucleotides are stacked in a relaxed duplex; that is, ai · ai+1 ≈ 1. Thus, stacking was defined to be disrupted
between two nucleotides for which ai · ai+1 <
0.5, implying that the orientation of neighboring nucleotides differed
by more than 60° (as described in ref (37) this criterion yields similar results to a direct
calculation of stacking energies while being computationally less
expensive; the criterion ai · ai+1 < 0, which
is more stringent, yielded disruption rates about 25% smaller in all
cases without any qualitative difference between different conditions).
A stacking disruption was then defined as “fraying”
when it occurred within the terminal three nucleotides on either end
of the main duplex, and “kinking” elsewhere, as shown
in Figure 4b(i).

Kinking is prevalent in the preunzipping state for main duplex
lengths between 35 and 50 bp, decreasing for other lengths, as seen
in Figure 4b(ii). However,
as unzipping proceeds to the transition state, the kink probability
becomes negligible. For shearing configurations, kinking is far rarer,
although it is also relatively more common at intermediate main duplex
lengths than for either shorter or longer main duplexes. Fraying is
relatively common in both preunzipping and preshearing initial states
when the main duplex is shorter than 40 bp, as seen in Figure 4b(iii). More fraying is seen
for the unzipping configurations at 25 and 35 bp than for the shearing
configurations and vice versa at 30 and 40 bp. This 10 bp periodicity
indicates that fraying depends on the torsion in the main duplex.
Also, unlike kinking, fraying only partially decreases during the
initial relaxation to the transition state, with the remainder of
the decrease occurring during relaxation to the final unbound state.
We note that the near-zero fraying probabilities obtained for the
relaxed structures are likely to be underestimates, as previously
observed for the geometric criterion at intermediate curvatures,37 and so the difference in fraying probability
between bound or transition structures and relaxed structures in actual
experiments may be even less than shown in Figure 4b(iii).

Kinking and fraying thus affect
the energetics of shearing and
unzipping, albeit in different ways. Kinking drastically reduces the
effective rigidity of the main duplex, and primarily stabilizes the
fully bound state relative to both the transition state and ruptured
state; that is, it decreases the free-energy cost of forming the target
duplex but not of bringing the sticky ends together beforehand. Thus,
kinking of the main duplex increases both ΔGtot and ΔG‡ by
similar, substantial amounts; it also appears primarily during unzipping
but not during shearing. In contrast, fraying only reduces the effective
length of the main duplex by a small amount, and affects both unzipping
and shearing in a torsion-dependent manner. As such, subsequent modeling
focuses on adding the effects of kinking to regular polymer mechanics.

2.4 Polymer Model for Shearing/Unzipping Energies
To describe the previous observations quantitatively, free-energy-extension
functions are written down for single-stranded and double-stranded
DNA and combined to estimate the mechanical contributions to ΔG‡ and ΔGtot. In bonded states, the extension x – xoffset of the single-stranded portion with nnt nucleotides (with xoffset accounting for the inclusion of the target duplex where
present) must match the end-to-end distance x of
the main duplex with nbp base pairs. Specifying
energies of single-stranded DNA ΔGss(x – xoffset, nnt) and double-stranded DNA ΔGds(x, nbp) at a given extension x then allows us to find
the equilibrium extension: it is the extension xeq such that 1  which is equivalent to matching the tension
in the single-stranded DNA with the compressive stress of the double-stranded
DNA. A freely jointed chain is used for single-stranded DNA, and a
wormlike chain is used for double-stranded DNA (see Figure 9 and Section 4.2 in Methods section for more details).
The mechanical energy of that state can then be calculated as 2  Because
the difference between shearing and
unzipping is purely geometric, the differences in the transition barrier
(ΔG‡) and total free-energy
change (ΔGtot) should completely
be accounted for in the mechanical energy. Base pairing then adds
the same free-energy contribution to both ΔG‡ and ΔGtot under
unzipping and shearing. This was empirically added in as an added
constant 18 kBT to ΔG‡ and 22.5 kBT to ΔGtot (which
thus includes the entropic cost of first contact), which gave the
best fit to the free energies determined from simulations. More detail
can be added to the model, such as by considering an ensemble of end-to-end
distance fluctuations instead of a single energy-minimizing configuration
or by varying the base-pairing contribution with the main duplex length
via additional theory. Nonetheless, the current level of detail appears
sufficient to capture key aspects of how the transition barrier and
total free-energy difference vary with the main duplex length.

As shown in Figure 3b, the resulting estimates are qualitatively accurate. ΔG‡ and ΔGtot are consistently larger for shearing than for unzipping, and the
minimum in ΔG‡ for unzipping
at main duplex length of 30 bp is accurately reflected. However, there
are some quantitative discrepancies, most noticeably the overestimate
of the total free energy required for unzipping or shearing when the
main duplex is 20 bp or shorter. In that regime, the contour length
of the main duplex is 7 nm or shorter, comparable to the contour length
of the target duplex and linkers so that instead single-stranded DNA
under compression would exert a tensile stress on double-stranded
DNA, both of which are outside the applicable ranges of the polymer
models used.

More importantly, the simple models consistently
overestimate the
transition barrier difference between shearing and unzipping by 5–10 kBT (dashed lines in Figure 3). This is attributable
to kinking of the main duplex, which is observed in simulated configurations
but not accounted for in the wormlike chain model of double-stranded
DNA. Kinking would also have the largest effect at intermediate main
duplex lengths, and indeed the discrepancy diminishes at a main duplex
length of 60 bp, where the average curvature per base pair decreases,
and hence kinking is less energetically relevant. As such, a term
for critical torque kinking43,44 was added, in which
DNA kinks whenever a critical torque τc is exceeded,
resulting in the kink free energy effectively linear in the angle: E(θ) = τc θ (the Vologodskii–Kamenetskii
model,45 which models the free energy of
a kink as proportional to θ6, was also studied, but
no significant improvement was observed).

With critical torque
kinking, the transition barrier estimate was
improved for main duplexes with lengths of 30–50 bp, consistent
with the frequent observations of kinking at those lengths, as described
in Section 2.3. However,
quantitative agreement was still not perfect. This may simply indicate
the inadequacy of the critical torque model, as its applicability
has only been directly tested for nicked double-stranded DNA and not
for a continuous helix.

However, as the critical torque model
improves the estimates of
transition barrier, it simultaneously degrades the estimates of the
total energy difference, especially for unzipping. This may be due
to the presence of fraying, as described in Section 2.3, which is not accounted for in this model.
More importantly, the constant-offset approach does not account for
the change in local concentration of the sticky strands with the main
duplex length because a longer main duplex allows the sticky strands
to achieve the first contact less often. Because this change in local
concentration does not affect the unzipping or shearing from the fully
bound state to the transition state, the constant-offset is less problematic
in predicting the transition barrier. In addition, there may also
be the influence of base stacking, which will be explored in the next
section.

2.5 Single-Strand Stretching Points to Base-Stacking
Contributions
Calculating the contour length and end-to-end
distance for the 5 nt linkers (the total of distances between successive
nucleotide base sites and the distance between first and last nucleotide
base sites, respectively) reveals features that are incompatible with
the simple freely jointed chain model used for single-stranded DNA,
as shown in Figure 5. The end-to-end
distance is consistently higher during unzipping than during shearing,
again reflecting the higher tensions that are being relaxed in the
process. However, the contour length is also significantly higher
during unzipping, indicating that the tension is high enough to affect
the assumption of an inextensible freely jointed chain. This is unlikely
to involve elastic stretching of the backbone bonds, given a stretch
modulus of 800 pN for single-stranded DNA,46 and likely involves the disruption of base stacking in fully or
partially bound states.

Base stacking contributes a free energy
on the order of 0.25 kBT per stacked base and can be observed in experimental force-extension
curves of single-stranded DNA.47 For 10–30
nucleotides of single-stranded DNA, its energy contribution may therefore
be 2.5–7.5 kBT, which is comparable to the discrepancies seen in Figure 3. Base stacking is especially
likely to be responsible for the large discrepancies in estimating
the total energy due to the modeling methodology as follows: transition
barrier is calculated as the difference between two modeled energies,
during which the base-stacking omission cancels to some degree, whereas
the total energy is calculated as the difference between one modeled
energy and a constant energy and the base-stacking omission remains
uncorrected. Furthermore, base stacking likely contributes to energetic
changes when there is a larger change in tension across the single-stranded
portions of the molecule and correspondingly the total energy discrepancy
is much larger for unzipping than for shearing. Nonetheless, base
stacking is difficult to account for quantitatively, especially in
a manner that is sequence independent, and as such a quantitative
model for its contribution is not attempted here.

2.6 Shearing and Unzipping as a Gating Mechanism
for Artificial Molecular Walkers
The basic principle of tension
enhancing unzipping preferentially to shearing is well understood,
but it remains to be seen how much dissociation bias48,49 can be extracted from this preference in the context of a real DNA
nanowalker. Indeed, the tension exerted to rupture the target duplex
can be estimated from the energy landscapes in Figure 2 by dividing the free-energy difference between
the 0-bond state and the unbound free-energy minimum by the distance
to that minimum. The resulting force estimates (shown in Figure 6a) lie between 3.5
and 6 pN, with the slightly higher forces for shearing than those
for unzipping reflecting the fact that the first contact requires
slightly more contraction of the main duplex. These forces might initially
seem too low to sustain significant bias.

Figure 6 (a) Effective force driving
shearing and unzipping in the studied
structures ranges between 3.5 and 6 pN. (b) Replacing the main duplex
with a polymer with higher persistence length dramatically increases
the transition barrier difference between shearing and unzipping,
as shown for hypothetical persistence lengths lp = 60 and 80 nm. The activation energies from ref (28) at a constant force of
11.8 pN are also shown as a benchmark; the constant force shear–unzip
gap is readily surpassed.

However, recent results28 suggest
that
even at a comparatively low force of 11.8 pN, the activation barrier
of unzipping 10 base pairs of DNA can be 9 kBT lower than that for shearing 10 base pairs,
which would imply that all else being equal unzipping would proceed
8000 times faster than shearing. Nonetheless, molecular vise experiments50 suggest that it only takes 9 pN of force to
bend a double helix of 40–50 base pairs of DNA or about 15
nm of double-stranded DNA. Furthermore, the force during unzipping
or shearing will significantly decrease as the process proceeds if
the released single-stranded DNA allows for additional relaxation.

This study demonstrates that the unzipping–shearing preference
remains a viable mechanism for powering DNA-based nanomachines, even
though the above-mentioned factors do reduce its magnitude. Even after
accounting for kinking and progressive relaxation, the transition
barrier difference between unzipping and shearing can indeed be as
high as 10 kBT under
ideal conditions. Furthermore, as shown in Figures 3 and 6, the difference
can be readily increased simply by preventing DNA kinking, perhaps
with chemical intercalation or by using a more rigid structure such
as DNA origami motifs.

The results also indicate that unzipping
and shearing can be used
to exert varying degrees of control over molecular dynamics, as shown
in Figure 7. Suppose
a DNA motor bound to a DNA track can be released either by unzipping
or by shearing a set of base pairs. All else being equal, unzipping
is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable to shearing because
it possesses both a lower transition barrier and a negative overall
free-energy change; as such, the unzipping process will be overwhelmingly
favored, allowing for clear discrimination between reaction pathways,
as shown in refs (14, 15).

Figure 7 Between competitive
DNA-rupturing pathways, unzipping is both kinetically
and thermodynamically favored over shearing. The balance between reversed,
DNA-binding processes “zipping” and “unshearing”
is more subtle: zipping should proceed more quickly and be kinetically
favored, but unshearing (or cyclization) is thermodynamically favored.
Energy landscapes here are for a main duplex length of 30 bp.

However, should the same motor
be designed to complete a forward
step via a reverse of those processes, it faces two competing biases:
zipping has a lower transition barrier and is thus kinetically favored,
but unshearing is now thermodynamically favorable due to the negative
overall free-energy change. The competition between kinetic and thermodynamic
biases means that in principle, the reaction duration will be critical
to favoring the correct reaction.

3 Conclusions
Bioanalogous molecular motors have been constructed from DNA using
the difference between unzipping and shearing rates to ensure selective
leg dissociation.14,15 This study suggests that the
DNA shearing versus unzipping asymmetry within the context of a real
DNA motor can differ significantly from the asymmetry measured in
a typical single-molecule setup. This study thus represents a first
step toward a thorough derivation of the expected speed and efficiency
of such devices from first principles rather than computationally
expensive simulations. The intramolecular mechanics plays an important
role in determining the performance of a molecular motor, as found
in previous studies of biological molecular motors.51−55

This study also supports that molecular vises
are an effective
probe of DNA bending and kinking.56 The
behavior of DNA under high curvature is an area of intense research.
It serves as a stringent test of detailed mechanical models of DNA,
as well as informing wider questions about how proteins bind, wind,
and unwind DNA in various biological contexts. Various models propose
that the force required to bend DNA undergoes a discontinuous change
past a critical amount of curvature45,57 or is even
fundamentally not quadratic in the angle of curvature in so-called
subelastic chain models.58

Various
methods have been proposed for probing DNA in the high-curvature
regime, including cyclization experiments which measure how the chemical
balance changes over time between a circular DNA molecule and alternative
linearized forms. It can be seen in panels (b), (d), and (f) of Figure 1 that the process
of shearing studied here has some analogies to (the reverse of) DNA
cyclization and as seen in Figures 3b and 4b(ii), shearing is only
minimally affected by high-curvature kinking. This contrasts with
another computational study, suggesting that kinking is pertinent
to cyclization experiments,38 and points
to the extra flexibility that even a few-nucleotides-long single-stranded
linker can provide.

Also, kink free energy can change the transition
barrier and total
free-energy change of unzipping by a few kBT, enough to make a measurable difference. As shown
in ref (50) both Euler
buckling and nonlinear kinking of the DNA duplex can be observed and
controlled in similar configurations. As such, this study provides
further evidence that “molecular vise” configurations
can be used to reliably induce high curvature in a DNA duplex and
study its effects rigorously.

4 Methods
4.1 Simulation
Umbrella sampling is used
together with virtual-move Monte Carlo simulation (VMMC) to sample
the behavior of the configurations. The VMMC is a numerical method
to accelerate configurational sampling; the umbrella sampling is used
to avoid long-time trapping at local free-energy minima. The two methods
have been combined in oxDNA (see ref (59) for details). For each configuration, three
simulation windows are defined: bound (1–10 pair bonds present),
unbound (0 pair bonds remaining, and minimum distance between strands
is at least 0.85 nm), or transitional (either 1–5 pair bonds
present or 0 pair bonds and minimum distance between strands is at
most 4.25 nm). A base pair bond is defined by a hydrogen bonding energy
of less than 0.596 kcal mol–1, around 15% of the
typical hydrogen bonding energy in the model.

Each configuration
is simulated within each window at temperature T =
27 °C for 108–109 VMMC steps, distributed
over 4–12 independent simulations. Umbrella sampling42 is used to enhance sampling of higher-energy
states and prevent simulations from leaving their respective windows,
with the umbrella weights chosen iteratively such that sampling is
uniformly distributed across different values of the reaction coordinate.
The resulting free energies from different simulations in the same
window agree with each other, showing that the number of steps used
is sufficient for convergence. Furthermore, the simulation windows
were chosen so that there is significant overlap in states between
the transitional window and the bound or unbound windows. In these
overlaps, the free energies from different windows also agree, further
demonstrating simulation convergence. A typical set of results is
shown in Figure 8.
A similar free-energy matching is employed across different ranges
of coordinates in a previous computational study of DNA bricks.60

Figure 8 Free energies calculated from individual runs in the bound
(purple),
transitional (green), and unbound (blue) windows agree with other
runs in the same windows and match the free energies from other windows
where there is overlap. Data shown here are for unzipping for a 40
bp main duplex; other data are similar.

4.2 Polymer Modeling
Theoretical polymer
energies are obtained by modeling the double-stranded DNA as a short
wormlike chain with the contour length of 0.34 nm/bp and persistence
length of lp = 40 nm and modeling the
single-stranded DNA as a freely jointed chain with the contour length
of 0.6 nm/nt and Kuhn length of b = 1.25 nm. These
parameters are consistent with established experimental ranges; attempts
to more precisely fit the data by variation of parameters either failed
or required highly unphysical parameter choices. In addition, as described
in the main text, constant base-pairing contributions of 18 kBT and 22.5 kBT were added to the transition barrier
ΔG‡ and the total free-energy
difference ΔGtot, respectively.
The configuration is then modeled in terms of the length x (end-to-end distance), xoffset (width
or length of the target duplex), nbplc/bp, and nntlc/nt (the contour length of the main duplex
and single-stranded linkers, respectively), as depicted in Figure 9 on a typical configuration.

Figure 9 Physical variables x (end-to-end
distance), xoffset (width or length of
the target duplex), nbplc/bp, and nntlc/nt (the contour lengths
of the main duplex and single-stranded
linkers, respectively), depicted on a typical configuration.

The force FFJC(x, lc, b) at which a polymer of
contour length lc and the Kuhn segment
length b has an average projection parallel to the
force x is 3  where L(s) = coth s – 1/s is
the Langevin function and the analytical approximation of its inverse61 is accurate to within 2%. The tensile energy GFJC is then obtained by integration.

The
bending energy GWLC(x, lc, lp)
at which a short wormlike chain of persistence length lp and contour length lc ≈ lp has an end-to-end distance x is given by calculating the bending energy in the principal flexural
mode, in which the chain assumes an “elastica” curve.50,62 4  where K(μ) is the complete
elliptic integral of the first kind. The parameter μ ≥
0 monotonically specifies how bent the rod is, assuming a value of
0 when the rod is fully extended; it is the solution to x/lc = 2E(μ)/K(μ) – 1, where E(μ)
is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind. The following
approximation is used 5  where M = 0.8261 is the value50 of
μ at x = 0.

Having specified the functional
forms of the energy-extension functions,
the equilibrium length xeq for DNA molecules
with nbp base pairs in the main duplex
and nnt nucleotides along a single-stranded
chain is found by equating the compression in the main duplex with
the single-stranded tension 6  Here, xoffset accounts
for the length or width of the target duplex, lying between the linkers,
and its value in various situations is given below. lc/bp = 0.34 nm is the contour length of a DNA duplex per
base pair; lc/nt = 0.6 nm is the contour
length of a single-stranded DNA per nucleotide. Once xeq is found, the energy can be substituted into the above
energy functional forms.

In a fully bonded shearing configuration,
the total length of the
main duplex is equal to the length of two DNA single strands with
6 backbone bonds and an additional 10 base pairs of double-stranded
DNA and xoffset is set to be 3.6 nm (the
diagonal length across a double helix is 3.4 nm long and 1.8 nm wide).
The transition configuration is considered to have two single strands,
each with 10 backbone bonds. A value of xoffset = 0.63 nm is found to optimize the fitting to simulation values,
which likely accounts for the width of the remaining base pair and
its freedom of relative alignment. Nonetheless, varying xoffset from 0 to 1.8 nm for the transition configuration
results in qualitatively similar plots.

In a fully or partially
bound unzipping configuration, the width
of the DNA duplex plays a similar role and xoffset is set to be 1.8 nm. As with shearing, the fully bound
state has two DNA single strands with 6 backbone bonds; the transition
state has 15 backbone bonds per single strand instead of 10, reflecting
the difference between the first contact of the sticky ends for shearing
and unzipping. Mathematically, the energy differences observed stem
largely from the different values of xoffset and the different number of backbone bonds in the transition state
due to the different binding geometries.

To incorporate DNA
kinking, the critical torque model43,44 was used.
In this model, the energy of a DNA duplex with a kink
angle θ is simply given by τcθ, where
τc is the critical torque. For this article, a value
of 29 pN nm was used, which falls within the range of 27–30
pN nm used in the literature. The double-stranded DNA energy GWLC of any given state was modified to be the
Boltzmann average of the kinked and unkinked energies; in practice,
the transition width thus obtained is very narrow, and Boltzmann averaging
essentially gives the minimum of both energies.
