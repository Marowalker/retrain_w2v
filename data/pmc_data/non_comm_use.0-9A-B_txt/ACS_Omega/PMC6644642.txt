Aluminosilicates
with ordered hexagonal mesopores denoted as MAS-7
and MAS-9 with uniform size were synthesized from zeolite β
assembly and ZSM-5 precursors, respectively, with P123 as a surfactant,
via the cooperative self-assembly pathway. A series of 12 tungstophosphoric
acid (TPA) supported on MAS-7 and MAS-9 (H3PW12O40/MAS-7/MAS-9) catalysts for biodiesel production were
synthesized via the wet impregnation technique. The characterization
of the supports and catalysts was done using N2 adsorption–desorption
analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and pyridine adsorption Fourier
transform infrared and Raman spectroscopies. Also, the 29Si magic-angle spinning and cross-polarization/MAS nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) techniques were employed to study MAS-7/MAS-9 and
the supported solid acid catalyst surfaces. The nitrogen sorption
analysis and XRD patterns indicated the formation of well-defined
mesoporous materials, whereas IR spectroscopy confirmed the presence
of four distinct types of OH groups with varying degrees of acidity. 29Si MAS NMR signified a stronger interaction between the framework
of mesoporous aluminosilicates and H3PW12O40. The X-ray absorption near-edge spectra of L1- and L3-edge tungsten showed that W in the H3PW12O40/MAS-9 sample exists as W6+, indicating the tungsten environment similar to that of H2WO4 with Oh symmetry. The catalytic activity of the synthesized catalysts was
investigated for biodiesel synthesis using unrefined green seed canola
oil as a feedstock, giving a methyl ester yield of 76.5–88.7
wt % under optimized reaction conditions. The catalyst activities
were strongly correlated with the surface chemistry of the TPA-supported
MAS-7 and MAS-9 catalysts.

==== Body
1 Introduction
One
of the routes leading to the production of green fuel is the
transesterification/esterification of vegetable oil/animal fat to
produce biodiesel. The green properties of these fuels are the result
of the fact that they are obtained from naturally derived compounds.
Hence, this fuel is substantially free of sulfur and aromatic compounds
and thus leads to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

The transesterification reaction is often catalyzed by the addition
of either base or acid catalysts. In case of the alkali-catalyzed
transesterification reaction, there are several problems associated
with the catalysts, including the product separation from the catalyst
and the formation of soap from the free fatty acids (FFAs) present
in the feedstock, thus making them undesirable for cheap feedstock.1,2 Different catalyst systems have been used to promote these reactions.3

Institut Francais du Petrole has developed
an EsterFipH process
for the transesterification reaction using solid catalysts based on
zinc aluminate.4 The main advantage of
the process is that it produces a high-quality glycerol but requires
partially refined vegetable oil to avoid the operating problems.4 Also, the Refining Hydrocarbon Technology developed
a process where FFA is first esterified using an acid catalyst, and
later the transesterification reaction is carried over a fixed bed
of solid basic catalysts. However, the main problem associated with
the solid basic catalysts is the leaching of catalysts into glycerol.5

The heterogeneous solid acids were found
to be more useful for
the low-quality or unrefined oils3 than
their solid base analogues and are expected to enhance the esterification
of FFA and transesterification of triglycerides simultaneously. It
is highly desirable to synthesize biodiesel from low-cost feedstock
to avoid the cost associated with the refined vegetable oil. This
cost can account for up to 85% of the biodiesel production cost.2,6

Considering the heterogeneous solid acid catalysis, supported
heteropoly
acids (HPAs) have achieved enormous interest in biodiesel synthesis
because of their structural mobility and super acidity. As HPAs lack
thermal stability and have a low surface area, they are incorporated
on acidic/neutral carriers like Al2O3 or SiO2. When compared to the other HPAs, 12 tungstophosphoric acid
(HPW, TPA, H3PW12O40) has a higher
acidity7 Atia et al.8 reported that alumina- and aluminosilicate-supported heteropolyacids
are more active than the silica-supported catalysts for glycerol dehydration.
As far as zeolites are concerned, they possess high thermal stability
and acidity related to their unique Al in building units, but small
pore size restricts their use when large molecules are involved during
the catalytic reaction. However, in the case of mesoporous aluminosilicates
with an ordered pore structure, low acid strength and thermal stability
are of primary concern. In such a scenario, the zeolite molecules
can be assembled into a framework structure such that the salient
features of the zeolite and mesoporous aluminosilicate materials are
maintained. Hence, the mesoporous aluminosilicates MAS-7 and MAS-9
were synthesized via the P123 surfactant with the as-formed zeolite
β and the precursors of ZSM-5. Further, these mesoporous aluminosilicates
can serve as a support for HPA owing to their exposed surface area
available and ordered mesoporosity, in turn improving the acidity
of the catalysts.

In the existing literature, aluminosilicates
with ordered mesoporosity
assembled directly from the zeolite precursors are yet to be explored
for the synthesis of biodiesel. This work focuses on TPA-impregnated
mesoporous materials with zeolite nanocrystallites like MAS-7 and
MAS-9 as new catalysts for the biodiesel synthesis in a batch reactor.
This manuscript provides detailed insights into the surface chemistry
of the catalysts when TPA is incorporated on MAS-7 and MAS-9 supports
and its correlation with the catalytic activity.

A series of
5–45 wt % TPA on MAS-7/MAS-9 catalysts were
prepared by the wet impregnation technique. The synthesized supports
and catalysts were employed for the biodiesel synthesis from low-quality
oils such as unrefined green seed canola oil. It is accessible in
large quantities in the western provinces of Canada. The synthesized
catalysts facilitated simultaneous transesterification and esterification
reactions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
of the Supports and Catalysts
2.1.1 Surface Analysis
The synthesized
catalysts, 0–45 wt % TPA/MAS-7, had a high surface area in
the range of 374–998 m2/g. For 0–45 wt %
TPA/MAS-9, it ranged from 333 to 740 m2/g. The introduction
of the HPW anions significantly changes the surface characteristics
as the surface area decreases with an increase in the HPW content.
From Table 1, it can
be seen that as more TPA anions are incorporated, more depositions
occurred on the external surface and resulted in the lowering of the
surface area.9 However, in the case of
25% TPA/MAS-7 and 15% TPA/MAS-9, an increase in micropore area was
observed which might be due to the development of abnormalities in
the pores. Also, for the other catalysts, a decrease in micropore
and mesopore areas and pore volume was observed after HPW loading,
thus suggesting that HPW is deposited in the mesoporous channels and
dispersed well on the surface of supports with ordered mesopores.
In the case of MAS-7, the average pore size, as well as the unit cell
parameter, hardly showed any change with TPA loading, but the values
obtained slightly varied from the values of MAS-7/MAS-9. The reason
behind this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that MAS-7/MAS-9
possesses both micropores and mesopores.

The t-plot analysis showed that MAS-7 and MAS-9
possessed microporous areas of 131.6 and 74.1 m2/g, respectively.
MAS-7 and MAS-9 possessed microporosities of 0.07 and 0.04 cm3/g, respectively, whereas for the synthesized samples TPA/MAS-7/MAS-9,
they varied in a nonsystematic way with TPA loading. The presence
of microporosity in both MAS-7 and MAS-9 can be accredited to the
occurrence of the respective primary units of zeolite MFI in the mesoporous
walls.10

2.1.2 Adsorption
Isotherm
The isotherms
of N2 for pure MAS-7 and MAS-9 and TPA-supported catalysts
are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The isotherms of all the catalysts
are of type IV as per the International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry categorization, marked by a step increase because of capillary
condensation (relative pressure of 0.2–0.4), and exhibited
the H1 hysteresis loop characteristic of mesoporous solids, with closure
at around p/p0 = 0.45
and 0.54 for MAS-7 and MAS-9, respectively.

MAS-7, (B) 5 wt % TPA/MAS-7, (C) 15 wt % TPA/MAS-7,

(C) 15 wt % TPA/MAS-9,
(D) 25 wt % TPA/MAS-9, (E) 35 wt % TPA/MAS-9, and (F) 45 wt % TPA/MAS-9.

The adsorption isotherms of TPA-impregnated
MAS-7 catalysts hardly
varied significantly, indicating that the mesoporosity of MAS-7 was
unaffected by TPA loading, that is, for 5–45 wt % TPA/MAS-7,
the shapes of the isotherms were similar to that of MAS-7, and the
main part of the hysteresis loop remained at the same relative pressure.
For 15–45 wt % TPA/MAS-9, the desorption branches extended
to a lower relative pressure (p/p0 = 0.45) compared to that of 5 wt % TPA/MAS-9 and MAS-9.
It has been reported that HPW anions may occupy or block the mesopores
of the aluminosilicates, thus increasing the average pore size and
decreasing the surface area.11

2.1.3 X-ray diffraction
The small-angle
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (0.5–10°) of MAS-7 possessed
the strongest and weak diffraction peaks at 0.87° and 1.5°,
ascribing to the (100) and (110) crystal planes, typical of the P6mm well-ordered hexagonal arrays of mesopores12 (Figure S1). The
sharp (100) diffraction peaks for MAS-7 and MAS-9 at 2θ = 0.87
and 0.9, respectively, gave the d-spacing values
of 11.0 and 9.8 nm. The cell parameters a0 were 12.7 and 11.3 nm, respectively, for MAS-7 and MAS-9 based on
the relationship a0 = 2d100√3. The wall thickness values calculated using
the equation “wall thickness = a0—pore diameter” were found to be 8.5 and 2.8 nm for
MAS-7 and MAS-9, respectively. It has been reported that longer reaction
duration and higher temperatures result in enlarged pore size and
decreased wall thickness.13 However, MAS-7,
which was synthesized at a higher temperature of 140 °C as compared
to MAS-9 (synthesized at 100 °C), had a greater wall thickness
and smaller pore size. The other factor, which can play a role in
increasing wall thickness, is the nature of silica.14 Fumed silica, which is used in the synthesis of MAS-7,
has a smaller unit of silicates and possesses a lower degree of polymerization
with higher diffusion rates in solution as well as aggregates, resulting
in the formation of thicker walls.

For the supported catalysts,
hardly any change in the planes corresponding to the long-range structural
ordering of MAS-7 and MAS-9 after HPW impregnation was observed. Hence,
it can be concluded that the supports MAS-7 and MAS-9 retained their
symmetry even after TPA loading.

The wide-angle diffraction
patterns for HPW in bulk, supports,
and 5–45 wt % TPA/MAS-7/MAS-9 catalysts are shown in Figures 3 and 4. A broad peak was observed at a 2θ value of 22.8°
corresponding to an amorphous structure of silica, which was more
pronounced in case of the MAS-7 and TPA/MAS-7 catalysts compared to
that of the TPA-supported MAS-9 catalyst. It can be attributed to
the source of silica used in the preparation of both the supports,
which was fumed silica in case of MAS-7 and tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS) for MAS-9. This peak was observed up to the loadings of 25
and 15 wt % for MAS-7 and MAS-9 supports, respectively. The absence
of the characteristic peaks of HPW at these loadings signified that
HPW was well-distributed on the support surface and also inside the
hexagonal channels and in the aluminosilicate pore walls, as the pore
size of MAS-7 and MAS-9 (4.2 and 8.5 nm) is higher than that of the
HPW (1.9 nm) crystals. As the loading increases from 25 to 45 wt %,
peaks related to TPA gradually occur. As the XRD patterns are related,
irrespective of the presence or absence of clear crystals, the diffraction
patterns for TPA on MAS-7 and MAS-9 show that TPA introduced is precisely
distributed on the MAS-7 and MAS-9 surfaces at a higher loading of
15 wt %. As the loading of TPA increases, some TPA exists as a crystal
phase.

and (G) TPA.

2.1.4 Raman
Spectral Analysis
Further,
the nature of impregnated HPW was studied using Raman spectroscopy.
The spectra of TPA supported on MAS-7 and MAS-9 are shown in Figures 5 and 6. The crystalline HPW shows the characteristic bands at 1009.8
cm–1 (symmetric stretching of PO4 sites),
991 cm–1 [antistretching (νas)
of W=Ot], and 931 [νas (W–O–W)],
which is in good agreement with the literature data.15,16 The low-intensity bands appearing at 538 and 516 cm–1 are attributed to W–O–W {symmetric stretching [ν(s)]}
and O–P–O {asymmetric deformation [ν(as)]}.17 After the impregnation of TPA into the MAS-7
and MAS-9 lattices, the peaks corresponding to the PO bond and W=O
vibrations were broadened; therefore, a broad peak was seen in the
range of 921–1053 cm–1. For 5 wt % loadings,
the characteristic keggin bands for supported HPW are hardly observed,
whereas 15 and 25 wt % loadings show only broad- and low-intensity
main bands at about 985 and 1010 cm–1, suggesting
an interaction of the keggin unit and the MAS-7/MAS-9 framework.

Figure 5 Raman
spectra of (A) MAS-7, (B) 5 wt % TPA/MAS-7, (C) 15 wt % TPA/MAS-7,
(D) 25 wt % TPA/MAS-7, (E) 35 wt % TPA/MAS-7, and (F) 45 wt % TPA/MAS-7.

Figure 6 Raman spectra of (A) MAS-9, (B) 5 wt % TPA/MAS-9,
(C) 15 wt % TPA/MAS-9,
(D) 25 wt % TPA/MAS-9, (E) 35 wt % TPA/MAS-9, (F) 45 wt % TPA/MAS-9,
and (G) TPA.

However, in the case
of 35 and 45 wt % TPA loadings, sharp and
higher intensity peaks were observed resembling that of pure TPA,
thus indicating that the keggin unit environment is identical to that
of HPW and hence confirms the retainment of the keggin structure even
after anchoring to the supports. However, for 45 wt % TPA/MAS-7, additional
peaks occurred at 710 and 804 cm–1, attributed to
the presence of crystalline WO3.18 This suggests that despite the retainment of the keggin unit, there
was some tungsten oxide formation on the surface.

2.1.5 29Si Magic-Angle Spinning (MAS)
and CP/MAS NMR Studies
The interaction of impregnated TPA
with the mesoporous aluminosilicate framework was studied via 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 1H → 29Si cross-polarization (CP, via dipolar coupling) detects
the NMR signal of silicon nuclei that are close to protons, which
makes it a reliable and sensitive technique for the detection of silicon
nuclei at or close to the surface of the MAS-7/MAS-9 materials. Figure 7B,D shows the 29Si CP/MAS NMR spectrum of the support MAS-7 and the synthesized
catalyst TPA/MAS-7 sample obtained at room temperature. The spectra
showed three 29Si signals at about −93, −102,
and −110 ppm, reflecting the presence of Q2, Q3, and Q4 units (Figure 7B,D).19 A dominating resonance
is observed at −102 ppm, and it is ascribed to Si* nuclei within
the X silicon linkages of XOSi*(OSi)3 (Q3), where X is H or TPA. The shoulder at −93 ppm
resembles the silicon atoms on the surface with two siloxane bonds
and either single- or hydrogen-bonded germinal silanol sites, (SiO)2*(SiOX)2 (Q2), whereas
at −110 ppm the resonance is due to the hydroxyl-free Q4 (siloxane) units—no heterolinkages
(either Si–O–H or Si–O–TPA).20 Note that this signal at −110 ppm dominates
the 29Si MAS NMR spectra of the corresponding system (Figure 7A,C), which makes
sense as there are much more silicon atoms inside the framework than
on the surface. The reason leading to a weak 29Si signal
for the Q4 unit in the CP/MAS spectra
is that the signal intensities of the CP/MAS spectra rely on the number
of protons and the dipolar coupling strength (i.e., the distance)
between 1H and 29Si, rather than on the amount
of silicon nuclei. Therefore, CP/MAS is not a suitable technique for
quantitation. 29Si MAS NMR should be applied for this purpose.

Figure 7 29Si{1H} MAS spectra of (A) MAS-7 and (C)
35 wt % TPA/MAS-7; 29Si CP/MAS NMR spectra of (B) MAS-7
and (D) 35 wt % TPA/MAS-7.

Figure 7A,C
shows
the 29Si MAS NMR spectra with proton (1H) decoupling
of MAS-7 and TPA/MAS-7. The signal at about −110 ppm, originated
from Q4 units, dominates the spectra,
especially for MAS-7. The signals from Q2 and Q3 can be clearly seen in the 29Si MAS spectrum of TPA/MAS-7. The spectra were therefore
deconvoluted into three components, with the 29Si chemical
shifts at about −93, −102, and 110 ppm corresponding
to the silicon nuclei in the Q2, Q3, and Q4 units,
respectively. Using the signal intensities from spectral deconvolution
(Table 2), the fractional
population of the surface germinal hydroxyl silanol sites and isolated
silanol sites was calculated. From the fractional populations, we
can calculate the surface SiOH concentration and the number of OH
groups per square nanometer (ηOH).

a X = H/TPA.

According to Leonardelli,21 if the different
chemical species in Q2, Q3, and Q4 are proportioned
as x, y, and z,
the number of OH groups, assuming that all the hydroxyl groups are
on the outer surface, measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method, is given by 1  where fg = x/(x + y), fs = x + y, and NA is the Avogadro number. The concentrations
of x, y, and z can
be given as x = fgfs, y = fs(1 – fg), z = 1 – fs. The ηOH values for the supports MAS-7 and MAS-9 and the synthesized catalysts,
as well as the distribution of Q2, Q3, and Q4 units
and their relative values, are shown in Table 2. The intensity redistribution of these silicon
sites is thought to be due to the reactions of the surface SiOH groups
with TPA. During impregnation, the protons of TPA (H3PW12O40) are transferred to the OH groups of the silica
surface, mainly with the germinal silanols of the support. Thus, the
terminal W=O groups within the keggin unit interact with the
surface (AlO)(HO)Si*(OSi)2 groups via W–O–Si(Al)
covalent bonding. Hence, the variation in the distribution of Q4 units in the supported catalysts was observed
because of the formation of heterolinkages. Also, the distribution
of Q3 unit in the TPA-supported catalysts
was found to increase, which could be probably due to the conversion
of two germinal units into silanol sites (Q3) upon subsequent dehydroxylation. Therefore, a higher value of (Q2 + Q3)/Q4 was observed for the TPA-supported catalysts,
thereby suggesting an interaction between the framework of mesoporous
aluminosilicates and TPA. A similar kind of distribution of Q2, Q3, and Q4 units was observed for the TPA/MCM-41 catalysts.19

2.1.6 Hydroxyl Framework and
Lewis and Bronsted
Acidity
Figure 8A shows the infrared (IR) νOH spectra of the mesoporous aluminosilicate
MAS-7 before exposure to the pyridine (Py) atmosphere. The band appearing
at 3741 cm–1 can be assigned to the external silanols,
whereas the other having a vibrational frequency of 3600 cm–1 is associated with the Bronsted acidity, and the intensity of this
band corresponds to the aluminum content of the zeolite and with the
extent of proton exchange.22 Further, the
relative intensity of external silanol when correlated with that of
the Bronsted acid band indicates smaller primary crystallites and
higher external surface area and agrees well with the BET and XRD
analyses. The νOH spectra also show the occurrence of a weak
band and a broadband at 3778 and 3720–3652 cm–1, respectively, ascribed to small noncharged extra-framework aluminum
and to the OH stretching vibrations of Al–OH, where Al would
be linked with the framework by chemical bonds.20

Figure 8 FTIR spectra of the hydroxyl stretching vibrations between 3820
and 3550 cm–1 of the mesoporous aluminosilicates
(A) MAS-7 and (B) pyridine-desorbed MAS-7 at 150 °C.

Figure 8B represents
the νOH spectra of the pyridine-desorbed MAS-7 sample.

The signal at 3600 cm–1 reappeared after pyridine
desorption at 150 °C, shifting to a lower wavenumber, thus indicating
an interaction with the bridging OH group, whereas the band at 3720–3652
cm–1 was found to be absent. The disappearance of
the band at 3720–3652 cm–1 perhaps is due
to the adsorption of pyridine on the Al hydroxyl species with the
subsequent dispersal of νOH vibration. Also, the band appearing
at 3778 cm–1 was found to be completely removed,
and hence it can be concluded that it is fully available for pyridine
adsorption. On the basis of the weak base interaction, it has been
reported that the band at 3778 cm–1 associated with
the Al–OH species is moderately acidic.20 Moreover, the bands in the region 3880–3700 cm–1 are usually present on aluminum oxides, in which
Al is present in the tetrahedrally coordinated part.23 Hence, it can be proposed that OHs are present over the
tetrahedral Al cations and are also associated with the formation
of Lewis sites (because of the coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ cations). On the other hand, the band at 3746 cm–1 of the OH vibration stretching of silanol remains unaltered. Isernia24 reported a similar observation.

To conclude,
MAS-7 showed four distinct types of OH groups with
varying degrees of acidity, except for the terminal OH groups. The
occurrence of these different OH groups on the metal oxide surface
can promote the bonding to metal sites of different coordinations.
Hence, this allows us to propose that the interaction of the HPW keggin
structure can take place at these sites.

The identity of the
acidic sites (Bronsted and Lewis acids) present
in mesoporous aluminosilicates and HPW-supported catalysts with varying
loadings has been deduced from the IR spectra of the framework vibrations
of the adsorbed pyridine (Figures 9 and 10). The pyridine adsorption
on MAS-7 and MAS-9 yields IR bands at 1448, 1602, and 1634 cm–1. The peak at 1448 cm–1 corresponds
to the hydrogen-bonded pyridine and hence ascertains the surface OH
group accessibility (donor H-bond sites), whereas the bands at 1602
and 1634 cm–1 indicate the formation of LPy species
(exposing the unsaturated metal sites) and Bronsted acid sites, respectively.
The intensity at 1535 cm–1, attributed to the formation
of BPy species, resulted in an increased intensity at higher HPW loading
(>25 wt % for MAS-7 and >15 wt % for MAS-9). The increase in
Bronsted
acidity with increasing HPW surface coverage can correspond to the
polytungstate clusters, which can delocalize the protons among the
neighboring tungsten trioxide species. Their occurrence was noticed
in the Raman spectra by the presence of W–O–W bands
at a loading of 45 wt % (Figure 5F). Similarly, the occurrence of the peaks at 1486
and 1624 cm–1, corresponding to the formation of
adjacent Lewis and Bronsted and Lewis acidic sites, was observed at

2.1.7 W L1- and L3-Edge
X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectra
2.1.7.1 W
L3-Edge
The W L3-edge spectra exhibit
prominent features referred to as white
line, which arises from the electronic transition from the 2p3/2 state to the 5d unoccupied states accompanied by several
excitations for the hybridized W 5d–O 2p conduction band. Figure 11(I) depicts the
L3-edge spectra of tungsten for the reference samples (A)
H2WO4, (B) Na2WO4·H2O, and the synthesized catalyst sample (C) 45 wt % TPA/MAS-9.
The W L3 spectrum of TPA/MAS-9 was found to be similar
to that of H2WO4 but different from that of
Na2WO4·H2O. Hence, it can be
said that 45 wt % TPA/MAS-9 exhibits Oh symmetry as H2WO4 exhibits Oh symmetry, whereas Na2WO4 showed Td symmetry. H2WO4 shows a broad peak,
whereas an unsymmetrical peak is observed for Na2WO4. These dissimilarities in the white line shape are because
of the ligand field splitting of the 5d states of tungsten. Yamazoe
et al.25 stated that the splitting of the
5d orbitals of the tungsten tetrahedral unit is smaller than that
of an octahedral unit. The second-order derivative spectra were used
to describe the splitting of the 5d orbitals in t2g (dxy, dxz, dyz) and eg (dz2, dx2–y2). Figure 11(II) shows the second-order
derivative spectra (X-ray absorption near-edge spectra, XANES) of
W L3 of 45 wt % TPA/MAS-9 and the reference samples. The
ligand field splitting was more readily observed for tungstic acid
(H2WO4) in the second-order derivative plot,
and the energy gap indicates the d-orbital splitting. H2WO4 has nearly an octahedral symmetry, and the lower energy
peak is referred to as a transition to orbital t2g vacancy,
whereas the peak at higher energy is ascribed to the excitation to
an orbital eg vacancy. The crystal field splitting [Δd = E(eg) – E(t2g)] for H2WO4 and 45 wt % TPA/MAS-9
was found to be 3.5 and 4.09 eV, respectively, whereas the WO4 units, as in case of Na2WO4, show a
minima in lower energy as the 5d orbital split is small in the tetrahedral
tungsten unit. The crystal filed splitting or the energy gap for Na2WO4 between the shoulder and the large peak was
found to be 1.5 eV, which is pretty much closer to the value reported
in the literature.25

spectra (I) and second derivative spectra
(II) of (A) H2WO4, (B) Na2WO4·H2O, and (C) 45 wt % TPA/MAS-9.

2.1.7.2 L1-Edge
The pre-edge
feature in the W L1 spectra is ascribed to the 2s to d–p
orbital transition, sensitive to the W bonding environment symmetry.
For tetrahedral symmetry, the unoccupied p orbitals strongly hybridize
with the d band, but not for regular octahedral symmetry.

As
the 2s → 5d transition is formally dipole-forbidden, regardless
of the symmetry, however, in case of distortion from the ideal symmetry,
the hybridization of 5p/5d orbitals makes 2s → 5d transition
possible, and therefore the pre-edge peak of Na2WO4 having the tetrahedral units of W is much more intense than
the other reference samples (Figure 12).

Figure 12 W L1-edge XANES (A) H2WO4 (B)
Na2WO4·H2O (C) 45 wt % TPA/MAS-9.
45 wt % TPA/MAS-9 and H2WO4 with W in octahedral
symmetry show small pre-edge peaks.

Curve-fitting for W L1-edge was done using an
arctangent
and Lorentz function similar to the pre-edge peak derivation from
the L3-edge (Figure S3). As
H2WO4 and 45 wt % TPA/MAS-9 lack the hybrid
d and p orbitals, mainly quadrupole electron transition could take
place from 2s to t2g and eg orbitals of 5d.
Hence, the pre-edges of H2WO4 and 45 wt % TPA/MAS-9
were fitted with two Lorentz functions, whereas the pre-edge of Na2WO4 was fitted with one Lorentz function.

2.1.7.3 Conjoint W L1- and L3-Edge XANES
On plotting the pre-edge area of the L1-edge versus L3-edge energy gap split, it was observed
that 45 wt % TPA/MAS-9 and H2WO4 with octahedral
coordination comprised a smaller pre-edge area and a large energy
gap, as shown in Figure 13, whereas Na2WO4·H2O
with a tetrahedrally coordinated W is recognized with a small energy
gap (L3-edge) and a larger pre-edge area (L1-edge).

XANES second derivatives: (A) H2WO4 (B) Na2WO4·H2O, and (C) 45 wt % TPA/MAS-9.

Consequently, from the W L1 edge, L3 edge,
and combined analysis, it was confirmed that tungsten in the synthesized
catalyst samples exists as W6+, residing in an octahedral
environment. In three-dimensional heteropolytungstates, WOX octahedral are connected within the wrapped surface
and not by the central atom. The terminal group, W=O of TPA,
interacts with the surface hydroxyls of the mesoporous framework (congruent
with the 29Si NMR studies), leading to the formation of
larger polyanions. These larger heteropolyanions generate Bronsted
acidity by effectively delocalizing the negative charge and aid in
the release of protons effectual for the transesterification and esterification
reactions. This also agrees well with the pyridine-adsorbed Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy measurements, in which an
increase in Bronsted acidity was found at higher TPA loadings corresponding
to the polyanion clusters.

2.2 Catalytic
Activity
2.2.1 Effects of TPA Loading on MAS-7 and MAS-9
The effects of TPA loading varying from 5 to 45 wt % in MAS-7 and
MAS-9 supports on methyl ester yield were investigated (Figures 14 and 15). In this study, the operating parameters of reaction
were fixed at 2.57 wt % (loading of catalysts), methanol-to-oil molar
ratio of 20:1, 200 °C, and 8 h.

Figure 14 TPA loading screening for MAS-7 (2.57
wt % catalyst, methanol-to-oil
molar ratio of 20:1, 200 °C, 4 MPa, and 8 h).

Figure 15 TPA loading screening for MAS-9 (2.57 wt % catalyst, methanol
to
oil molar ratio 20:1, 200 °C, 4 MPa, and 8 h).

The supported solid acid catalysts gave the methyl
ester yield
between 60 and 79 wt % in 8 h as compared to MAS-7 that only showed
41 wt %. It is well-known that acidity favors the transesterification
and esterification reactions. Hence, with the low HPW loading, expectedly
a low activity of 5 wt % TPA/MAS-7 was observed in comparison to other
TPA on MAS-7/MAS-9 catalysts because of the lower number of acidic
sites. However, 25 wt % TPA/MAS-7 showed a higher activity as compared
to 35 wt % TPA/MAS-7 and 45 wt % TPA/MAS-7.

The results in Figure 14 suggest that at
a HPW loading higher than 25 wt %, the acidic
sites ingrained in the mesopores could have been unavailable because
of the plugged mesopores, confirmed by the BET analysis, leading to
an insignificant increase in the yield of ester.

Hence, the
activities of the two catalysts did not significantly
increase the methyl ester yield as compared to the 25 wt % TPA/MAS-7
catalyst in which most of the HPW anions were well-dispersed on to
the support. This optimum dispersion was confirmed by the XRD analysis
(Figure 3D). Hence,
25 wt % TPA loading was found to be optimum for the MAS-7 support.

For the support MAS-9, despite higher HPW loading, 45 wt % TPA/MAS-9
showed reduced activity as compared to 35 wt % TPA/MAS-9 (Figure 15). For instance,
to obtain a methyl ester of 72, 35 wt % TPA/MAS-9 required only 5
h, whereas 45 wt % TPA-supported catalysts required up to 6 h. The
maximum ester yield obtained in 8 h was 89.7 wt % at a TPA loading
of 35 wt % in the case of MAS-9 support.

2.2.2 Effects
of Surface Acidity on Catalytic
Activity
Figure 16A,B shows the quantitative correlation of surface acidity
with the catalytic activity (methyl ester yield and FFA conversion)
as a function of different TPA loadings for MAS-7 and MAS-9, respectively.
The results indicated a direct relationship between the catalytic
activity and the total surface acidity of the catalysts, that is,
the catalytic activity increases with the total surface acidity. Figure 16A shows that 25
wt % TPA-supported MAS-7 exhibits a higher catalytic activity and
can be related to the highest total surface acidity because of the
better dispersion of the keggin anions on the surface of the catalyst,
with an optimum surface area and pore diameter facilitating the simultaneous
transesterification and esterification reactions.

Figure 16 Correlation of the catalytic
activity with the surface acidity
of the catalysts as a function of TPA loading: (A) TPA/MAS-7 and (B)
TPA/MAS-9.

However, with the higher
amount of TPA loading on the catalyst
surface, hardly any significant increase was found in the catalytic
activity and can be interpreted by the surface area, and pore volume
decreases with the amount of TPA loading (Table 1) and the decreasing accessibility by the
triglyceride molecules.

Hence, the total surface acidity was
found to decrease, which in
turn affected the catalytic activity despite the retainment of the
keggin anions at the TPA loadings (determined by XRD and Raman analyses)
as high as 45 wt %. In the case of MAS-9, 35 wt % TPA-supported MAS-9
showed the highest catalytic activity, attributed mostly to the surface
acidity of the catalyst.

Besides, it was observed that TPA/MAS-9
had a higher acidic strength
than TPA/MAS-7, as the MAS-9 precursor ZSM-5 is more acidic than the
MAS-7 precursor zeolite β.

2.2.3 Statistical
Analysis
The ester
yield was determined at different combinations of the catalyst weight,
alcohol/oil ratio, and reaction time for the 25 wt % TPA/MAS-7 catalyst. Table 3 gives the minimum
and maximum limits of each factor used. The quadratic model equation
was derived using response surface design of experiments (DOE) for
determining the combinations of these three factors giving the maximum
ester yield. The model has an R-square value of 0.90,
meaning it is capable of explaining 90.3% of variations in the yield.
The maximum ester yield predicted by the model is 76.7% (95% confidence
interval—66.8, 86.6%), with the optimal settings of factors
being 5.5 wt % of the catalyst, 14.9:1 methanol/oil ratio, and 10
h of reaction time. However, it was seen from the Pareto chart of
standardized effects (Figure 17) and the main effect plots of yield for factors and their
interactions (Figure 18) that only the methanol/oil ratio and the reaction time have a statistically
significant impact on the ester yield. The catalyst weight when varied
between 1 and 10 wt % did not have any statistically significant impact
on the ester yield. However, at 5.5 wt % catalyst, the ester yield
is maximized. Previous researchers have also reported that the catalyst
loading did not influence the ester yield significantly.26

factor	unit	minimum	maximum	
catalyst

reaction time	H	4	10	
The yield of ester increased
with the increase in reaction time,
whereas for methanol/oil molar ratio, it increased until the midpoint,
and after that decreased. A similar trend was observed by the authors
Xie and Li.27 The catalyst 35 wt % TPA/MAS-9
gave an ester yield of 88.7 ± 4.2 wt % at the above-optimized
conditions. Polyoxometalate supported on various meso/macroporous
oxides resulted in 82–96% of oleic acid conversion at 200 °C.
The most stable catalysts against the leaching of active material
were heteropolyacid supported on 3.5% SiO2–ZrO2 and SiO2–Al2O3.28 The use of HPMo/Nb2O5 resulted
in 99.7% ester yield at conditions of 20 wt % catalyst loading, 90:1
ethanol-to-oil molar ratio, a reaction temperature of 210 °C,
and a reaction time of 4 h.29 Phosphotungstic
acid-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (HPW-PGMA-MNPs) gave 98%
FAME yield after 24 h at 122 °C, with the catalyst loading of
4 wt % and 33:1 methanol/grease molar ratio.30

2.2.4 Reusability Study of the Supported Catalysts
The separated catalyst was washed with tetrahydrofuran (THF) for
the removal of nonpolar and polar components and then subsequently
regenerated by drying at 100 °C for 24 h. The results obtained
for the first three cycles are presented in Figure 19 along with the surface acidity (mole of
H+/g) of the catalysts. Reduction of 3.3 and 4% in the
catalytic activity was observed for 35 wt % TPA/MAS-9 and 25 wt %
TPA/MAS-7, respectively, after the first reuse. However, not a significant
decrease in the ester yield was observed from the successive reaction
runs.

Figure 19 Methyl ester yield (wt %) and surface acidity of the catalysts
(mole of H+/g) after successive reaction runs.

The presence of active material in the present
study, that is,
HPW was monitored by UV–vis based on 253 nm absorption, ascribed
to the transfer of the charge terminal/bridging oxygen 2p to the tungsten
5d orbital (W–O–W and W–Od).31 For the leaching of TPA in methanol, a calibration
curve was constructed with the standard solution of HPW in methanol
at concentrations of 1.5, 3.1, 6.2, and 12.4 ppm. The concentration
of the catalysts before and after the reaction was deduced from the
curve obtained. The results hardly showed any significant leaching
(0.002 and 0.001%) of the active phase from the supports MAS-7 and
MAS-9 and can be associated to the interaction of the keggin anion
with the supports, confirmed by the 29Si NMR studies. This
study is supported by Kozhevnikov11 who stated that the reaction was
truly heterogeneous and that the leaching of active phase was negligible.

Bala et al.32 showed that the PTA/KIT-5
catalysts exhibited the highest conversion of 83% for used cooking
oil and 100% for palmitic acid at optimum conditions, and their catalyst
recycling studies indicated 22% loss in conversion at the end of four
cycles because of the leaching of acid from the framework. TPA-supported
cesium-containing Niobia (TPA/Cs1.0/Nb2O5) when
employed for the esterification of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD)
gave an ester yield of 90% at 65 °C after 8 h, with 15 wt % catalyst
loading and 15:1 methanol/PFAD ratio. However, the catalysts showed
poor reusability, marked by 15% decrease in the catalytic activity,
at the fifth run because of the blockage of active sites and the alteration
in the structure of the catalysts. Moreover, the catalysts were unable
to reactivate via calcination.33 The 20%
H3PW/ZrO2 catalyst with an oleic acid conversion
of 88% in 4 h at 100 °C with 1:6 oleic acid/ethanol molar ratio
and 10 wt % catalyst loading resulted in the leaching of 8 wt % of
H3PW after the first reuse.34

3 Conclusions
H3PW12O40 on MAS-7/MAS-9 catalysts
were synthesized by wet impregnation. As per the BET analysis, the
mesoporosity of the synthesized catalysts was found to be preserved
after the impregnation of TPA at a loading as high as 45 wt %. XRD
and Raman studies confirmed the retainment of the keggin anions on
the support, whereas 29Si NMR suggested a stronger interaction
between the framework of mesoporous aluminosilicates and H3PW12O40. Hence, no leaching of TPA from the
support was observed. X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy
of W L1 and L3 edges indicated that W in the
TPA-supported catalysts is in an octahedral-like coordination, and
hence the system was effective for the transesterification and esterification
reactions. The synthesized catalysts showed suitable physicochemical
properties for the biodiesel production. The acidic strength of TPA/MAS-9
was higher than that of TPA/MAS-7, as the precursor of MAS-9 was more
acidic than the MAS-7 precursor. The 35 wt % TPA/MAS-9 and 25 wt %
TPA/MAS-7 showed catalytic activities of 88.7 of4.2 and 76.5 an2.5
wt %, respectively, with unrefined green seed canola oil under optimized
reaction conditions. Further, the catalysts separated by filtration
and drying at 100 °C confirmed their reusability without a considerable
decrease in activity.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of MAS-7 and MAS-9 Supports
Hydrothermally
stable mesoporous aluminosilicates MAS-7 and MAS-9
with ordered hexagonal structures were synthesized from the assembly
of a triblock polymer surfactant (P123, Fisher Scientific) with a
precursor of zeolite β and ZSM-5 in a strongly acidic media,
according to the report by Han et al.10 and Xia et al.12 The procedure for the
synthesis of MAS-7 and MAS-9 is as follows: (1) The zeolite β
precursor solution was prepared by mixing 0.4 g of NaOH, 0.83 g of
NaAlO2, and 16.8 g of fumed silica into 75 mL of tetraethylammonium
hydroxide (1 M in water, Aldrich) with the molar ratios of 1.0/60/2.5/22/800
for Al2O3/SiO2/Na2O/TEAOH/H2O. The mixture thus obtained was aged at 140 °C for 4
h. (2) The precursor solution with ZSM-5 was obtained by adding 0.35
g of NaAlO2 in 14 mL of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide solution
(1 M in water, Aldrich) and 24 mL of TEOS (>98%, Aldrich) with
68
mL of water. The molar ratios of Al2O3/SiO2/Na2O/(TPA)2O/H2O were maintained
at 1.0/50/1.0/7/1800. The precursor solution was then aged at 100
°C for 3 h. (3) 10 g of the polymer surfactant (P123) was dissolved
in acidified water (265 mL of water mixed with 98 mL of 10 M HCl).
The precursor solution obtained in step (1) or (2) was introduced
dropwise to the polymeric solution and stirred at 40 °C for 20
h. Then, the mixture was transferred into an autoclave at 100 °C
for 36 h. (4) The white product obtained was filtered, dried in an
oven, and calcined at 550 °C for 5 h for template removal.

4.2 Preparation of TPA/MAS-7/MAS-9 Catalysts
A series of 5–45 wt % TPA-anchored MAS-7/MAS-9 catalysts
were prepared using a wet impregnation method. A 10 mL of the methanolic
solution of TPA was used to impregnate 1 g of MAS-7/MAS-9 supports.
The samples were stirred at room temperature, oven-dried at 110 °C,
and were further calcined.

4.3 Catalyst Characterization
The BET
isotherms were assessed using Micromeritics ASAP 2000. The samples
were degassed at 300 °C for 3 h. The surface area was obtained
with the BET method. The pore size distribution was obtained with
the help of the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda model.

The low-angle and wide-angle diffractions were obtained on a D8 Advance
powder diffractometer [monochromatic Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å)
radiation]. The supports and catalyst samples were scanned from 1.5°
to 10° and 10–90° with a 2θ step size of 0.01.

For FTIR spectroscopy of pyridine adsorption, the measurements
were performed on a Fourier transform spectrometer (Vertex 60 Bruker,
Germany) in the region 4000–400 cm–1, with
a resolution of 4 cm–1. The Raman spectra of the
catalysts were obtained on a Renishaw system 2000 spectrometer (785
nm).

The 29Si NMR technique was applied to study
the chemical
environment of 29Si nuclei in these mesoporous aluminosilicates.29 The Si solid-state NMR experiments were carried
out on an AVANCE III HD Bruker spectrometer operated at 99.36 MHz
(1H frequency at 500.13 MHz), with a Doty CP-MAS probe
of 4 mm. Both 29Si MAS and CP/MAS (cross-polarization)
experiments were carried out at 6 kHz spinning speed, along with 1H decoupling. For 29Si MAS experiments, 1024–4096
scans were accumulated for different samples, with a 45° pulse
and a 5 s recycle delay. For 29Si CP/MAS experiments, 2048–4096
scans were accumulated for different samples, with a 2 s recycle delay
and a 5.0 ms of contact time. The 29Si chemical shifts
are referenced to a 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid sodium
salt at 0 ppm.

The XANES analysis was carried out to study the
environment of
W in TPA-supported catalysts. The X-ray absorption spectra were obtained
on the IDEAS beamline at Canadian Light Source Inc., Canada. A Ge(220)
double-crystal monochromator was employed to cover the energy range
of tungsten L1- and L3-edges in transmission
mode and fluorescence yield using a Si drift detector. The reference
compounds, such as Na2WO4·H2O and H2WO4 were measured in transmission mode
for comparison and energy calibration. All XANES data were processed
using the Athena program.

The total surface acidity of the synthesized
supports and TPA-impregnated
catalysts was determined by acid–base titration. A 100 mg of
catalyst was dissolved in 20 mL of NaOH (0.1 M). The solution was
agitated at room temperature for 3 h to facilitate ion exchange. The
supernatant obtained after centrifugation was titrated with 0.1 M
HCl using phenolphthalein indicator. The surface acidity was indicated
in terms of moles of H+/g of the catalyst.

4.4 Catalyst Activity
The performance
of the synthesized catalysts was determined via simultaneous transesterification
and esterification of green seed canola oil (FFA content—3.74
wt %). A 100 mL of the Parr reactor was used to carry out the reaction.
Green seed oil of 35 g was preheated to 60 °C. A weighed amount
of catalysts was introduced into the reactor vessel followed by methanol.
The preliminary experiments for the catalysts were conducted at 200
°C, methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 20:1, 2.5 wt % catalyst (weight
of the catalysts based on green seed canola oil), and 600 rpm.

After the reaction, the contents were filtered to separate the catalysts.
For ester phase analysis, high-performance liquid chromatography was
used (Agilent Technologies). A Hewlett-Packard 1100 series was employed
in ester content analysis. Two Phenogel columns (5 μm, 100 Å,
300 × 7.80 mm) with a column temperature of 24 °C were used.
THF at 1 mL/min for 20 min was used as the mobile phase. The detector
temperature was maintained at 35 °C, whereas the sample injection
consists of 20 μL. The following eq 2 determines the ester yield (wt %) 2  

The acid value
(AV) of the produced biodiesel was calculated as
per the AOCS-D6751 method, and eq 3 determines the conversion of FFA. 3  

The leaching
test of the TPA-supported mesoporous aluminosilicates
was performed with methanol as the solvent. Methanol is one of the
reactants in transesterification and esterification reactions, and
TPA is highly soluble in the polar solvent. Hence, the supported catalysts
were evaluated by adding 50 mL of methanol to 0.02 g of the solid
at room temperature and kept under magnetic stirring for 1 h. An aliquot
was withdrawn at regular intervals using a 1 mL syringe with a 0.2
μm filter. The concentration of TPA was measured by a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (UV mini 1240 Shimadzu), with the scanning range
of 200–800 nm wavelength.
