We
present the results of experiments involving the isotopic fractionation
by diffusion of K+ cations in methanol at 298 K along with
supporting molecular dynamic simulations. The experiments, using glass
Rayleigh fractionators filled with a methanol solution of KCl, constrain
the ratio of the individual diffusivities of 41K and 39K (D41K/D39K) in methanol, and so the isotopic fractionation
of K+ due to diffusion in methanol, to 0.9995 ± 0.0001.
This isotopic fractionation is 25% of the fractionation resulting
from K+ diffusion in water. This is consistent with published
molecular dynamics simulations indicating greater hydrodynamic coupling
between K+ ions and solvating methanol molecules compared
to K+ ions and solvating water molecules.

Introduction
The phenomenon of chemical diffusion through
a medium, for example,
gas or liquid, is commonly observed to produce an isotopic mass fractionation
of the diffusing element. In the special case of diffusion involving
ideal gases, kinetic theory results in a relationship given by eq 1 1  where α is the fractionation factor
between isotope x and isotope y of an element or the ratio of the
diffusivities of isotope x and isotope y, m is mass
of isotopes x and y, and the exponent β is equal to 0.5 (in
which case eq 1 becomes
Graham’s law of effusion/diffusion), and is a good approximation
in certain situations such as the isotopic separation of gaseous uranium
hexafluoride species.1 However, in the
case of solute atoms diffusing in a fluid such as water, there is
no available theory, but it has been experimentally determined that
β is typically less than 0.5.2−5 Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) of
solute diffusion in water confirm that the mass dependence of solute
diffusivity (D) has an inverse power-law form as
indicated by eq 1, but
where β is less than 0.25 and varies with diffusing species.6,7 In addition, experiments have shown that for isotopic fractionation
of cations by diffusion in molten silicates, β’s are
also less than 0.25 depending on the cation and the melt composition.8−12

Here, we use Rayleigh fractionation apparatus (bulbs) developed
by Richter et al.2 to measure the relative
diffusivities of different isotopes of dissolved ionic species in
water to instead measure the relative diffusivities of 39K and 41K in methanol. This method was inspired by the
mid-19th century experiments conducted by the Scottish physical chemist
Thomas Graham which would lead to his eponymous law of effusion where
the ratio of the rates of effusion of two gas species is equal to
the square root of the inverse ratio of their molar masses13,14 and by his subsequent experiments regarding diffusion in aqueous
solutions.15

Our experiments were
run for lengths of time during which the volume
outside the bulb would act in effect as an infinite sink for K. The
Rayleigh fractionator system allows direct comparison of the diffusivities
of the different isotopes of a dissolved species.2 In the case of the reported experiments, we are comparing
the relative diffusivities of the stable isotopes 41K and 39K, the two most common isotopes of potassium. In which case,
in eq 1 x stands for 41K and y stands for 39K.

Previous work has
focused mainly on diffusion in water (e.g. refs2−5), and provides a baseline for evaluating the controls on isotopic
fractionation during diffusion in fluids. Our purpose is to provide
a measurement of isotopic fractionation of K by diffusion in a different
solvent, methanol, to provide insights into how solute–solvent
molecular interactions affect isotopic fractionation. We also wish
to demonstrate the feasibility of the Richter et al.2 Rayleigh fractionation technique for determining isotopic
fractionation by diffusion in solvents other than water. Methanol
is a strong polar solvent with properties such as dipole moment and
dielectric constant close, when compared to other solvents, to water,
and so provides an interesting comparison and a good starting point
for exploring the phenomenon of isotopic fractionation in other classes
of solvents.

Experimental Setup
The set of ten
bulbs (Rayleigh fractionators) we used in our experiments
were fashioned of quartz glass, with interior volumes ranging from
0.59 to 0.75 cm3 (average of all 10 is 0.66 cm3) with a 1 mm inner-diameter tube providing communication with the
outside environment (Figure 1). The experimental design produces precise values for the
ratios of diffusivities; however absolute values of diffusivities
are not as well constrained because of size variations among the different
bulbs.2

Figure 1 Photograph (left) of the Rayleigh fractionation
bulb used in experiments
to determine the isotopic fractionation of K by diffusion in methanol.
The bulb consists of a quartz glass sphere that is filled with a solute–solvent
mixture and acts as a source for diffusion via a tube to a much larger
volume of the solvent that acts as an effective infinite sink for
the solute. The glass cylinder attached to the sphere provides a base
for standing the bulb during filling and sampling. A platinum wire
is used to hang the bulb within the volume of solvent contained in
a 300 mL Erlenmeyer flask (right).

A starting solution was made with KCl (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS
reagent
grade, dried for 12 h in an oven at 115 °C and cooled in a desiccator
prior to weighing) and methanol (Aldrich Honeywell PURANAL, semiconductor
grade, max. 0.05% H2O by wt) to a K concentration of 9.0
mM, which is ∼16% of the solubility at 25 °C.16,17 Each bulb was filled with this starting solution using a syringe
fitted with a quartz-glass needle to draw in the solution, and then
hung within an Erlenmeyer flask by platinum wire from a glass rod
wand and submerged ∼2–3 cm in ∼250 mL of pure
methanol. The glass rod was passed through a silicone stopper fitted
to the Erlenmeyer flask and sealed with silicone sealant to avoid
evaporative loss of the methanol (Figure 1). The bulbs were allowed to diffusively
exchange with the flask volumes for periods ranging from 1 day to
35 days (Table 1) while
held in a constant temperature bath at 25 °C (298 K). At the
end of their individual experimental periods, the bulbs were removed
from their flasks and the methanol KCl solution in the bulbs quantitatively
removed. An aliquot of this solution was dried down and brought up
in 3 M HNO3 for K concentration analysis by Q-ICPMS. The
remaining portion of the methanol was analyzed for water content by
Karl-Fischer titration using a Mettler Toledo DL39 coulometric KF
Titrator and EMD Millipore Aquastar CombiCoulomat fritless reagent,
all located inside an Ar-purged glovebox. The postexperiment concentrations
of H2O in the methanol solutions from the bulbs were 0.10–0.17%
by weight.

K Isotopic Analysis
The K isotopic compositions (reported
as δ41K, see below) of experimental samples were
measured using an IsoProbe (VG Instruments, Ltd) multicollector magnetic
sector inductively coupled plasma source mass spectrometer. The IsoProbe
is equipped with a RF hexapole ion-guide that allows the introduction
of gasses to provide both energy focusing, as well the removal of
isobaric interferences arising from Ar ions. In the case of the K
isotopic measurements reported here, He and H2 were introduced
to the hexapole region at rates of 10 and 1 mL/min, respectively,
to suppress mass interferences from Ar isotopes. Aliquots of the K
bearing methanol solutions were taken to provide 500 ng of K and dried
down. The dried samples were then taken up in 0.3 M HNO3 to a concentration of 500 ppb to match the K concentration of a
bracketing in-house K isotopic reference.18 Sample solutions were introduced to the mass spectrometer using
an Aridus II (CETAC Technologies) desolvation system with a Teflon
nebulizer with a measured uptake of 60 μL/min. For further details
of the K isotopic analysis see refs.3,18 The potassium isotopic composition
is reported as 2  where (41K/39K)reference is the average of the two bracketing
analyses of
the K reference solution prior to and after the analysis of the sample.
The uncertainties in δ41K provided in Table 1 are based on the combined uncertainties
in the analyses of the bracketing reference and the sample.

Molecular
Dynamics Simulations
To place our experimental
results for K diffusion in methanol into a molecular-scale context
and relate them to previous results for K diffusion in water, we conducted
molecular dynamics simulations at 298 K in the NVT ensemble using version 4 of LAMMPS,19 with the Jorgensen OPLS force field20 and Lennard-Jones potential parameters for K+ taken from
Jensen and Jorgensen.21 Long-range K+-methanol interactions were calculated via Ewald summation,
and time integrations were calculated using a standard velocity-Verlet
integrator,22 while short-range interactions
were calculated using a combination of Lennard Jones and Coulombic
potentials with a global cutoff of 12 Å. Simulations consisted
of a single K+ cation and 398 methanol molecules in a periodically
replicated, cubic simulation cell with sides 30 Å in length,
thereby approximating infinite dilution conditions with a simulation
cell density of approximately 0.78647 g cm–3—the
density of pure methanol at 298 K. In order to investigate D as a function of isotopic mass, K+ diffusion
was simulated for a range of hypothetical isotopic masses, from m = ∼10 to 156 Da.

Simulations were run in
100 ps slices (with a 1 fs timestep), and the results from each slice
were compiled to create a dataset for 1 ns worth of simulation time.
Each successive 100 ps simulation began where the previous simulation
ended in order to maintain continuity. A total of nine 1 ns datasets
created in this way resulted in 9 ns of total simulation time. Prior
to the “start” of the 9 ns simulation, the entire system
was subjected to 1 ns of equilibration at 298 K.

The position
and velocity output data from LAMMPS were recorded
every 5 fs; these data were used to calculate the velocity autocorrelation
function (VACF) using an in-house program based on the Fortran VACF
code internal to MOLDY 3.6.23 Briefly,
the VACF was calculated by applying a 5 ps moving average window to
each 100 ps simulation slice; 90 of these “windowed”
VACFs (i.e., 10 VACFs for each ns of simulation time) were produced
for each hypothetical K isotope. A representative normalized VACF
for 39K+ (the most abundant naturally occurring
stable isotope of K) at 298 K is given in Figure 2a; the value decays to approximately zero
within about 3 ps.

Figure 2 (a) Normalized VACF of 39K+ in methanol
at
298 K. (b) Value of the self-diffusion coefficient (D) prior to correcting for system-size effects is given in the thick
black line as calculated via eq 3 as a function of time (i.e., the integral upper limit). The
thin black lines outline the 95% confidence error envelope.

Each 20 ps-long “windowed”
VACF was in turn individually
integrated using the following Green–Kubo relation (eq 3; e.g., ref (22)) to determine the corresponding
self-diffusion coefficient, Di, where
i refers to an individual 20 ps “windowed” VACF 3  

The plot of D averaged over all data for 39K+ at
298 K is given in Figure 2b, which shows that the self-diffusion profile
plateaus at around 4 ps, indicating that the upper limit of the integral
must be calculated with τ > 4 ps. The infinite-time limit
in eq 3 was therefore
approximated
by calculating the value of Di for τ
= 4.5–5.5 ps. As noted by Bourg et al.,3 self-diffusion coefficients calculated in this way can differ by
up to 24% between two consecutive 2 ns-long blocks; therefore, the
overall self-diffusion coefficient for a given K isotope (D) was calculated by averaging over all Di values for that isotope, and precision was quantified
in terms of standard errors. Calculating D at larger
values of τ gave comparable results, albeit with lower precision.

Translational diffusion coefficients are known to have system-size
dependence in MDS performed with periodic boundary conditions (cf.,
refs24,25). We therefore corrected our average D values for
each isotope using eq 12 in Yeh & Hummer:25D0 = DPBC + 2.837297kBT/(6πηL), where DPBC is our average D (PBC = “periodic boundary condition”); kB is the Boltzmann constant; T is the absolute temperature of our simulation (298 K); η is
the viscosity of methanol at T (0.544 mPa s at 298
K26); and L is the length
of our cubic periodic box (30 Å). We note that this is described
by Yeh & Hummer24,25 as an “ideal” correction:
as detailed in Yeh & Hummer,24 charged
particles in polar solvents require the correction factor to be scaled
by a value less than one (e.g., 0.88 for K+ in H2O) in order to accurately account for the observed system-size dependencies.
As such, our correction may be a slight overestimate, but it accounts
for the size of the simulation box nonetheless.

Results and Discussion
The results of the diffusion experiments are presented in Table 1. From the starting
concentration of 9 mM, the postexperiment K concentrations in the
bulbs ranges from 1.5 to 7.4 mM, while the isotopic composition (δ41K, see eq 2)
of the K remaining in the bulbs ranges from 0.09 to 0.8‰. The
highest δ41K is associated with the lowest remaining
concentration (1.5 mM), while the lowest δ41K is
associated with the highest concentration (7.4 mM), indicating that
an isotopic fractionation of K occurred with the diffusion of K from
the bulbs into the surrounding methanol contained by the Erlenmeyer
flasks. In Figure 3a, the data are presented as a plot of F (the fraction
of K remaining in the flasks relative to the starting concentration,
see Table 1) against
the δ41K of the remaining K in the methanol contained
in the bulbs. As expected from the experimental set-up, the data follow
the form of a Rayleigh fractionation model given by eq 4 4  where R/R0 represents
the fractional change of the K isotopic composition
relative to the starting composition, F is the fraction
of K remaining in the bulb relative to the starting concentration,
and α (see eq 1) is the isotopic fractionation factor. For a derivation of eq 4 in the context of the
diffusion bulbs see Richter et al.2 Taking
the log of both sides of eq 4 yields the linear relationship 5  where log(R) = log((δ41K/1000) + 1), and log(R0) = log(((δ41K)0/1000) +
1). Using eq 5 to plot
the experimental data (Table 1) results in Figure 3b.

Figure 3 Panel (A) shows the relationship between the K isotopic composition
of bulb contents and the fraction of K remaining in those bulbs (i.e.,
that which had not diffused into the “infinite” reservoir).
Data are from Table 1. The same data were input into eq 5 (see text) to produce panel (B), from which the fractionation
factor α is derived from the slope, (1-α), of the best
fit line to log((δ41K/1000) + 1) plotted against
the negative of log(F) (see eq 5). Errors shown in each panel are 2 times
the standard deviation.

A linear best-fit to the data in Figure 3b using Isoplot27 yields a value for α of 0.9995 ± 0.0001 (±95% confid.)
from the slope (a fractionation of 0.5‰), and from the y-intercept an initial δ41K for the starting
solution of −0.081 ± 0.099‰ (±95% confid.),
which is indistinguishable from our in-house K isotopic reference.
Using this value of α in eq 1 with the masses of 39K and 41K, β is calculated to be 0.010 ± 0.002 (±95% confid.).
The MDS we conducted (Figure 4 and Table 2) results in a β of 0.011 ± 0.024 (±95% confid.)
(or an α of 0.9995 ± 0.0011 (±95% confid.)). Though
the MDS results have relatively large uncertainties (about 10 times
greater than the results from the diffusion experiments), the MDS
results are similar to our experimental values. Our MDS also yields
a value (using 39K to stand for K) for the diffusivity
of K in methanol of 1.393 ± 0.006 × 10–5 cm2/s, which is within the uncertainties of the experimental
value 1.396 ± 0.001 × 10–5 cm2/s for 25 °C (using the Nernst–Einstein equation with
limiting conductance data28), lending support
to the validity of the simulation.

of K+ in
water3 and the MDS result for diffusion
K+ in methanol over a range of hypothetical isotopic masses.
The slope of the best-fit lines gives β values of 0.049 ±
17 for K+ diffusion in water3 and 0.011 ± 0.017 for diffusion in methanol.

Our experimental results for the isotopic
fractionation of K by
diffusion in methanol can be directly compared to published experimental
results by Bourg et al.3 using the same
technique for the isotopic fractionation of K by diffusion in water.
They report a value for β of 0.042 ± 0.002, which corresponds
through eq 1 to an α
of 0.9979 ± 0.0001 (a fractionation of 2.1‰) representing
an approximately four times larger isotopic effect. From molecular
dynamics modeling of the effect of isotopic mass on the diffusion
of K+ and other monovalent ions (Li+, Na+, and Cs+) as well as divalent (Mg2+ and Ca2+) and neutral (He, Ne, Ar, and Xe) species, Bourg
et al.3 observed an inverse relationship
between tau (residence time of water in the first solvation shell
of the solute) and β. From this inverse relationship, Bourg
et al.3 infer that solute species that
are less hydrodynamically coupled to solvent molecules (reflected
by solvent molecules having short mean residence times around the
solute) experience greater isotopic fractionation attending diffusion
(i.e., β’s increasing toward the limiting value of 0.5,
cf. ref (6)). Comparing
then the isotopic fractionation of K+ by diffusion in water
to that by diffusion in methanol suggests that the hydrodynamic coupling
between K+ and methanol molecules is stronger than between
K+ and water. This is consistent with MD simulations comparing
diffusion of ionic and uncharged solutes (including K+ and
K) in water and methanol that found a lower Stokes friction but a
higher dielectric friction for solutes in methanol indicating greater
hydrodynamic solute–solvent coupling in methanol.29

Conclusions
We have demonstrated
that a simple set of experiments using a Rayleigh
fractionator bulb developed by Richter et al.2 to determine isotopic fractionation of dissolved species by diffusion
in water can also be used with a different solvent, methanol. Presumably
isotopic fractionation by diffusion in other nonaqueous solvents could
also be determined in this manner. Our experiments regarding isotopic
fractionation of K+ in methanol yields a fractionation
factor, α, of 0.9995 ± 0.0001 (±95% confid.), about
25% of the isotopic fractionation factor for K+ diffusion
in water. This result is consistent with greater hydrodynamic coupling
between K+ and solvating methanol molecules compared to
K+ and solvating water molecules.
