In
this paper, we report the growth of a high-quality 100 nm thick
InSb layer on a (001) GaAs substrate for InSb-based high-speed electronic
device applications. A continuously graded buffer (CGB) technique
with InxAl1–xSb was used to grow high-quality InSb films on GaAs substrates.
The CGB layer was grown by continuously changing the growth temperature
and composition of the aluminum and indium during the growth of the
buffer layer. Degradation of electrical properties, which normally
accompany carrier-defect scattering in a heteroepitaxial layer, was
minimized by using the CGB layer. The electrical properties of the
InSb films were characterized by Hall measurements, and the electron
mobility of the 100 nm-thick InSb film had the largest value, of 39 290
cm2/V·s, among reports of similar thickness. To investigate
the relationship between electrical and structural properties, the
100 nm thick InSb film was characterized by energy-dispersive spectroscopy
and transmission electron microscopy.

1 Introduction
Indium antimonide (InSb),
with its narrow band gap of 0.17 eV and
ultrahigh electron mobility exceeding 80 000 cm2/V·s, has attracted considerable attention for various applications.
These exceptional properties allow InSb to be used in high-performance
electronic and optoelectronic devices such as magnetic sensors,1,2 micro-Hall sensors,3 long-wavelength
photodetectors,4−6 and electronic logic devices.7,8 Unfortunately,
the homo-epitaxy of InSb on an InSb substrate is limited by the high
cost of the substrate, compared with conventional semiconductor materials
such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) or Si, and its high conductivity,
which is undesirable for device fabrication which require an insulating
substrate. For these economic and physical reasons, InSb films are
generally grown on semi-insulating (SI) GaAs substrates. However,
the physical properties of InSb (lattice-constant = 6.48 Å) are
degraded by defects when grown on GaAs substrates because of a 14%
lattice mismatch between the InSb and GaAs.

This lattice mismatch
leads to serious defects, such as threading
dislocations (TDs), micro-twins (MTs), and cracks located around the
interface. However, the TDs, which cause electron-defect scattering
at the surface, are reduced as the thickness of the InSb film increases.9 As a result, improved electron mobility is exhibited
in thicker InSb films. Unfortunately, a thin layer is preferable for
high speed electronic devices applications because switching between
on and off states is difficult with a thick layer. Thus, reducing
defect density in thin-layer InSb on GaAs is crucial for real applications.

Defects due to lattice mismatch can be minimized by using certain
growth techniques. For example, a metamorphic-buffer technique has
been developed on commercially available substrates such as GaAs,
and Si.10,11 According to several reported studies on
the growth of high-quality InSb on GaAs substrates, the lattice mismatch
problem can be partially solved by using a step-graded buffer (SGB)
of AlSb and InAlSb.12−20 It is also important to provide optimized growth conditions, such
as growth temperature and growth rate, for the SGB of the AlSb and
InAlSb.12−15 For instance, Sato et al. grew a 2 μm thick InSb active structure
on GaAs substrates using an AlSb and In1–xAlxSb SGB technique, while Biefeld
and Phillips used an InAlSb buffer layer.15,16 In addition, Mishima et al. used an In1–xAlxSb/In1–yAlySb short-period super-lattice
layer to reduce dislocations by changing the composition of In and
Al. As a result, they reported a decrease in defects between the InSb/In1–xAlxSb
and In1–xAlxSb/In1–yAlySb interfaces and have proposed analytical modeling for In1–xAlxSb
buffer layers based on structural analysis.17−20

In this work, we apply
an InxAl1–xSb continuously GB (CGB) technique
to grow a 100 nm thick InSb film.21 The
technique effectively minimized the defects associated with lattice
mismatch between the GaAs and InSb. The composition of In and Al in
the InxAl1–xSb buffer layers was manipulated continuously by controlling
the substrate temperature and the In and Al cell temperatures. The
InSb thin film grown with the InxAl1–xSb CGB technique exhibited the highest-electron
mobility among reported InSb films of equivalent thickness.

2 Experimental Procedure
Four InSb thin-film samples
and an InAlSb terminated sample were
grown using the InxAl1–xSb CGB technique with varying Al compositions. The
samples were grown on SI GaAs(001) substrates in a Riber compact 21E
solid source molecular beam epitaxy system.

The native surface
oxide of the SI-GaAs(001) substrates was removed
by heating the sample to 620 °C under an As2 atmosphere
using a valved cracker cell. Subsequently, a 0.1 μm thick GaAs
buffer layer was grown at 580 °C to form a smooth surface, while
a (2 × 4) reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED)
pattern was maintained. The growth atmosphere was changed from As2 to Sb2, while decreasing the temperature of the
substrate (Tsub) to 450 °C. The RHEED
pattern of the substrate changed from a (2 × 4) pattern to a
(1 × 3) pattern under Sb2 atmosphere, which was maintained
until the opening of the Al shutter.

Sb was supplied by a Veeco
Sb-valved-cracker cell. The beam equivalent
pressure of Sb2 was 1.7 × 10–6 Torr.
An InxAl1–xSb CGB buffer layer was grown on GaAs substrates in a two-phase
growth procedure. Figure 1a shows the scheme of the entire growth process in this work,
including the continuous changes in the temperature of the cells,
growth time, expected lattice constants, and the composition of In
and Al.

Figure 1 (a) Schematics of the growth method using the In1–xAlxSb metamorphic continuous
grading buffer (CGB) technique, with changing In and Al flux. The
scale is not real. (b) Time dependence of Al fluxes measured by simulating
the 2nd phase operation. Below a TAl of
940 °C, no flux was measured from the Al cell. (c) Calculated
InSb thickness based on the results of (b).

In the first phase, the In composition was continuously increased
in the CGB layer for an hour. The temperature of the Al cell was kept
constant at 1130 °C, equivalent to a 1.45 Å/s AlSb growth
rate, while Tsub was maintained at 450
°C. Meanwhile, the temperature of the In cell was increased from
600 to 755 °C, which is the In growth rate equivalent to 0 and
3.80 Å/s of InSb, respectively. The In composition in the InxAl1–xSb
was gradually raised from 0 to 70% as the In cell temperature increased,
and a gradual change in the lattice constant of the InAlSb CGB layer
was expected. All samples were prepared using the same growth process
in the first phase.

In the second phase, the Al composition
of the InxAl1–xSb CGB was decreased
with a reduction in growth temperature. While the In cell was maintained
at a constant temperature of 755 °C, which corresponds to a growth
rate of 3.80 Å/s, the temperature of the Al cell was linearly
decreased from 1130 °C to the targeted temperatures (TAl), as Tsub decreased
from 450 to 400 °C. The total time for CGB and InSb growth was
kept constant at 1 h. Various TAl of 850,
875, 900, 925, and 950 °C were used for five different samples.

Figure 1b shows
the Al flux variation for each of the TAl (850, 875, 900, and 925 °C) as a function of time. The horizontal
dash-dot line indicates zero flux of Al corresponding to an Al cell
temperature of 940 °C. Al flux is nearly ignorable below the
cell temperature of 940 °C. This was confirmed by energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) measurements, which indicated the growth of pure
InSb below the cell temperature of 940 °C. On the basis of the
results in Figure 1b, the expected growth time of the InSb film for each sample was
1,080, 852, 544, and 264 s. The growth of the fifth sample with the TAl of 950 °C was terminated with an InAlSb
alloy.

Figure 1c shows
the calculated thicknesses of the InSb film grown with each sample.
For TAl of 850, 875, 900, and 925 °C,
thickness was 410, 324, 207, and 100 nm, respectively. This thickness
calculation is in agreement with our previous study. Using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and secondary ion mass spectroscopy, which
has a depth resolution of about 1 nm, the thickness of an InSb layer
grown for 1080 s was confirmed to be 0.41 μm.21 Although the Al cell temperature linearly decreased, the
Al flux variation was inversely exponential to a function of time.
This implies that the Al growth rate decreased exponentially as a
function of time.

Electron mobility and doping concentration
were characterized using
an Ecopia HMS-3000 Hall measurement system. It was implemented with
a standard van der Pauw 4-probe method on a sample area of (5 mm ×
5 mm) at room temperature.

The microstructure analysis was carried
out using a 200 kV TECNAI
F20 G2 SuperTwin transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro,
OR) with the sample mounted in a double-tilt holder (Gatan, Pleasanton,
CA). TEM images were obtained by an UltraScan 1000 (2k × 2k)
CCD camera (Gatan Inc.) and a Fischione model 3000 ADF detector. EDS
mapping and line profile were obtained with a Talos F200X transmission
electron microscope with a Bruker Super EDS System.

3 Results and Discussion
Figure 2a shows
the electrical properties of the InSb film samples for various film
thicknesses, characterized by a Hall measurement system at room temperature.
For 100, 207, 324, and 410 nm thick InSb films, electron mobility
was 39 290, 38 920, 41 740, and 46 300
(cm2/V·s) and electron carrier density was 1.7, 1.9,
2.8, and 2.5 (×1015/cm3), respectively.
Meanwhile, the electron mobility of the InAlSb terminated sample grown
with a TAl of 950 °C, presented in Figure 2a (open circle and
box), was 19 910 (cm2/V·s). The value is approximately
half that of other InSb samples, and attributed to the incorporation
of Al into the InSb films, although the composition of Al on the top
is considered less than ∼4%. The relationship between InSb
thickness and TAl is discussed in the Experimental Procedure section.

and carrier density measured at room temperature.
The InAlSb terminated sample was grown at TAl = 950 °C. (b) Scatter plot of electron mobility of the resulting
InSb film compared with previously reported results at room temperature.9,11,13,14

The tendency of increasing mobility
as the thickness of InSb increases
is in agreement with others results.19,21,22 Commonly, degraded electronic mobility can be attributed
to defects such as MTs, TDs, and and so forth, because electron travel
is disturbed by electron-defect scattering. Therefore, as defects
are reduced by curing processes during growth, the electron mobility
of the film increases.14,17−21,23

Figure 2b compares
the electron mobility of InSb films in this work to other reported
results. The electron mobility of the 100 nm thick InSb film in this
work was 39 290 (cm2/V·s), while previous reports
of mobility of InSb on GaAs with a thickness of 100 nm were limited
to 1400 (cm2/V·s).11 Comparisons
with other thicknesses show that there was also a considerable amount
of improvement in electron mobility over other reported values. These
enhancements are attributed to the reduction in defects in the InSb
film by separating the InSb film from defects near the GaAs interface,
using the InxAl1–xSb CGB technique.

Figure 3a shows
a dark field TEM image of the 100 nm thick InSb film with horizontal
yellow-dashed dot lines, which are designated as points A and B. They
will be explained in Figure 3b–d. The distance between the GaAs substrate and points
A and B is 1.22 and 0.3 μm, respectively. The thickness of the
InxAl1–xSb CGB layer including the 100 nm-thick InSb film is 2.33 μm.
Fringes appear because of inevitable distortion produced by the focused
ion beam (FIB) milling process.24 Defects
such as TDs and MTs are distinctly shown near the interface between
the GaAs and InAlSb CGB, resulting from stress caused by lattice mismatch
between the GaAs and (Inx)Al1–xSb. The defects are mostly located in an area between
the interface and point A. However, the nucleation and glide of dislocation
is reduced from point A to the InSb.

Figure 3 (a) TEM dark field image of the 100 nm
thick InSb film on GaAs
substrate with a 500 nm scale bar. The horizontal yellow-dashed-dot
A and B lines indicate points 1.22 and 0.3 μm from the GaAs
substrate. (b) EDS line profile of the sample along the white dashed-arrow
in Figure 2a, and EDS
2D mapping image of In and Al with a 500 nm scale bar. (c) Calculated
lattice constants and R from SAED patterns at the
points. (d) Lattice mismatch along axy and azz at a point near the GaAs lattice constant.

Figure 3b
shows
the distribution of elements, including Ga, In, Al, As and Sb, from
the GaAs substrate to the InSb film surface. The growth rate was assumed
to be 0 Å/s at the start of first phase because the measured
In flux was almost zero at the cell temperature of 600 °C. In
elements, however, were detected at the interface of the GaAs/InxAl1–xSb.
This is mainly attributed to overshoot of the In flux from the In
source during the sudden opening of the shutter, and partially to
the intermixing of In during growth.

The In composition gradually
increased from the substrate interface
to the InSb film surface. Interestingly, the gradual trend in composition
changes at point A. The slopes of In intensity and Al intensity as
a function of length become smaller across point A. Here, we can conclude
that point A is related to a change in the first and second phases
during growth (see Figure 1a).

The trend is attributed to the change in slope of
the composition,
resulting from the different slopes in the change of In and Al fluxes
in the first and second phases. That is, in the first phase, only
the In cell was gradually heated up. Meanwhile, in the second phase,
only the Al cell was gradually cooled down. The slope of each cell
temperature was different.

The EDS results confirm that Al atoms
do not exist near the surface.
The thickness of the InSb as measured from the EDS is approximately
104 nm. This is in quite good agreement with the thickness of the
InSb calculated from the Al flux (see Figures 1c and 3b). The EDS
data once again confirm that the growth of the InSb film was pure
without any Al near the surface.

Here, we should point out that
the Tsub decreases beyond point A, which
is the point where the second phase
of the CGB layer start. Most of the defects are limited to the region
between the interface and point A. This implies that the generation
and glide of dislocations during the in-plane strain relaxation is
suppressed. This suppression is attributed to an increase in the yield
strength and limitation of the dislocation thread and glide, resulting
from the decrease in growth temperature in the second phase.25,26 The abrupt change in slope of the composition may contribute to
the reduction in defects above point A because of the formation of
a virtual interface which reflects defects.27

To analyze the relationship between dislocations and strains
of
the InAlSb CGB layer, the lattice constants were compared along the
growth direction by the constants from selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) patterns. The lattice constant ratio along (110) (axy) over the one along (001) (azz) in the nondeformed zinc-blende
crystal structure of III–V materials is . The lattice
constant ratio (R) is calculated by dividing azz with axy from  

If the R is , the crystal
structure at the point is
cubic and if the R is smaller or larger than , the cubic
structures at the point are
compressively and tensely deformed, respectively.

Figure 3c shows
a calculated azz lattice
constant from the SAED image at the points, the SAED pattern along
the growth direction of the sample and R. The dashed
blue arrow indicates  which means that the crystal structure
is cubic. The SAED image indicates that there is high-quality single
crystallinity throughout the whole sample. The patterns mean a typical
zinc blended structure. The calculated azz lattice constants gradually increase from the GaAs
surface to the InSb film surface.

R is slightly
increased to 1.41 at a point approximately
170 nm from the interface, while the R of the AlSb
layer at the interface with the GaAs substrate is about 1.403. The
variation in the R value means the crystal structure
of the (In)AlSb GB layer at the surface of the GaAs substrate is deformed
by the in-plane strain due to lattice mismatch.

Meanwhile the
deformed structure changes to a cubic form because
of relaxation of the in-plane strain following the generation and
gliding of dislocations up to point B, which is about 170 nm from
the GaAs substrate. The strain relaxation produced by dislocations
is also shown in Figure 3a. The dislocations are reduced beyond point B. This is attributed
to the low temperature growth of the (In)AlSb CGB buffer layer in
the first phase with a Tsub of 450 °C.
Subsequently, the R value gradually decreases as
the GB layer is grown on the InSb surface. This means that deformation
of the crystal structure is favorable, to relieve in-plane strain,
rather than the generation and gliding of dislocations.

Figure 3d illustrates
the lattice mismatch between the GaAs substrate and various points
along the growth direction in the InAlSb CGB layer for axy and azz. The lattice constants calculated from each of
the SAED patterns. The difference in lattice mismatch axy and azz is minimized at a point ∼170 nm from the
GaAs substrate because the in-plane strain is relieved by the generation
and gliding of dislocations, as mentioned earlier. The difference
increases beyond point B to near the InSb film surface.

Considering
the dark field TEM image, R, the lattice
mismatch, the in-plane strain is relieved by the generation and gliding
of dislocations in the first phase of the growth below point A. This
agrees with the dark field TEM image in Figure 3a where dislocations are mostly observed
in the lower region of the CGB layer below point A. On the other hand,
the in-plane strain is slightly increased with suppression of dislocations
in the second phase of growth above point A, which is attributed to
the decrease in Tsub.

4 Conclusions
The InxAl1–xSb CGB technique, combined with control of the Al,
In cell,
and growth temperature, is an effective method for overcoming the
problem of lattice mismatch between InSb and GaAs. Using the InxAl1–xSb
CGB technique, an InSb film with a thickness of 100 nm was grown,
which exhibits an electron mobility of 39 290 cm2/V·s. This is a noticeable improvement over other reports with
similar thickness. Reducing the thickness of InSb films while preserving
their properties is crucial to applications in high-performance devices.
The InxAl1–xSb CGB technique offers a potential method to obtain high-quality
III–V films by heteroepitaxy for real applications.
