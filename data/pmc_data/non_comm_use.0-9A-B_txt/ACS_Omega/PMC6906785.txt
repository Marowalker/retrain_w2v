Graphene microspheres are fabricated through a 3D-printed
inkjet nozzle based on the gas–liquid microfluidic method.
This method realizes rapid and controllable fabrication of uniform
graphene microspheres with up to 800 μL min–1 (ca. 1 L d–1) of yields, which is 2 orders of
magnitude higher than those of the conventional microfluidic method.
The diameter of the graphene microspheres could be flexibly controlled
from 0.5 to 3.5 mm by adjusting the gas pressure. The porous graphene
microspheres show great dye decoloration performance. The maximum
adsorption capacity of methylene blue is 596 mg/g, which is the highest
adsorption capacity among that of the reduced graphene-oxide absorbents.
A performance improvement of 21% is obtained by applying sodium alginate
into graphene as a curing agent. The adsorption behavior follows a
Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Besides,
the graphene microspheres exhibit great selective adsorption and could
separate cationic dye methylene blue (MB) and anionic dye methyl orange
(MO).

1 Introduction
The
shortage of freshwater resources is a global environmental issue.
Water contamination caused by the development of industry and human
activities is consuming the freshwater resource severely.1,2 Pollutants in water lead to a great threat on the environment and
ecosystem.3,4 Organic pollutants, such as dyes, antibiotics,
and pesticides, and heavy-metal ions such as Cu2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, and Cr6+ are considered as
the most serious contaminants.5,6 Physical adsorption is
regarded as a promising way for the removal of those hazardous pollutants.4 Graphene and its derivatives have been gaining
intensive research interest in water treatment application due to
their great specific surface areas and excellent adsorption performance.7,8 Besides, graphene is regarded as a promising support for photocatalysts
such as TiO2 and ZnO for in situ degradation of adsorbed
organic contaminants.9,10

Although many research
works on developing 2D graphene-based absorbents have been carried
out,11,12 the irreversible re-stacking and agglomeration
of graphene caused by the van der Waals forces and π–π
bonds between graphene layers severely reduce the number of active
adsorption sites thus resulting in inevitable performance degradation.
Moreover, the suspended 2D graphene is difficult to retrieve and regenerate.
In order to improve the retrieval performance and maintain the large
surface area of graphene at the same time, porous graphene with a
3D geometric structure is desirable,13−16 such as graphene films,
graphene tissues, graphene sponges, and graphene spheres.17,18 The 3D geometric structure of graphene could be fabricated by various
methods, including self-assembly,19,20 additive manufacturing,
sol–gel methods,21 electrostatic
spinning,22 and microfluidics.23,24 Ma et al.25 fabricated porous graphene
gels based on a combined sol–gel and hydrothermal method for
methylene blue (MB) adsorption. An adsorption capacity as high as
192 mg/g of the ultralight reduced-graphene oxide gels is achieved.
Nevertheless, the traditional self-assembly and sol–gel method
are limited by the volume of the reactor, which restricts the continuous
production of graphene.26−28 Electrostatic spinning could be used to fabricate graphene microspheres,
but the diameters of the product are highly nonuniform.29 Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing,
holds bright prospects in producing graphene in complex geometric
structures. Zhu et al.30 demonstrated a
3D graphene aerogel fabricated through the 3D-printing method, which
exhibits a great surface area and high compressibility. However, it
is inefficient and high in cost to achieve mass production of 3D-geometric
graphene through additive manufacturing. As for microfluidic methods,
shearing forces between flowing immiscible phases are used to pellet
evenly dispersed graphene particles. Benefiting from continuous operation
and excellent shape controlling, the microfluidic approach holds promise
on the continuous production of 3D graphene on an industrial scale.
Wang et al.31 produced well-shaped 3D graphene
microspheres with a uniform size by microfluidics, which exhibit high
adsorption activity against organic and inorganic contaminants. To
the best of our knowledge, all types of microfluidic generation of
3D-geometric graphene are based on a liquid–liquid two-phase
flow in which organic solutions such as n-hexane
and silicon oil20,21 are used as the continuous phase.
In liquid–liquid microfluidics, low flow rates have to be kept
(generally less than 200 mm s–1) to maintain the
droplet flow pattern. As a result, the yield of graphene products
is restricted by the operation flow rates. The design and manufacturing
of microfluidic chips are other crucial factors affecting the production
of 3D-geometric graphene. The commonly applied method for microfluidic
chip fabrication includes glass capillary assembly, etched silicon
assembly, and soft lithography.32−34 The processes of these methods are complex and not suitable for
the fabrication of sophisticated flow structures, which is necessary
for preparing special structures like shell or core–shell geometries.

To fill the gap, this study aims to develop a novel rapid synthesis
method with higher production rates in orders of magnitude for 3D
ultralight graphene aerosol microspheres with highly porous microstructures.
In order to achieve a higher yield of microspheres, an air–liquid
shearing flow rather than a conventional liquid–liquid process
was applied. Because of the replacement of the liquid shear phase
by air, a higher flow rate of the continuous phase could easily be
achieved due to the higher dispersion-phase flow rate. A 3D nozzle
embedded with microfluidic channels was designed and fabricated via
3D printing to realize the air–liquid-based fast manufacturing
process. The structure of the 3D nozzle and the sketch map of microsphere
fabrication are shown in Figure 1a,b. The yield of shaped microspheres reaches 800 μL
min–1 (ca. 1.1 L d–1), compared
to 2 μL min–1 (ca. 3 mL d–1) from conventional liquid–liquid methods.31 The diameter of microspheres can be easily manipulated
by adjusting the flow rates of air and gel. The porous structure of
the 3D graphene microspheres is formed and controlled by using sodium
alginate (SA) as the curing agent.35 The
calcium alginate (CA) generated by SA works as a framework of microspheres,
and the ice formed in lyophilization works as a pore template.36 Taking methylene blue as a target contaminant,
the adsorption capacity of the microspheres is 596 mg g–1, which is among the highest adsorption capacities compared in reported
graphene adsorbents. In addition, the prepared materials show great
selective adsorption of cationic over anionic pollutants.

of microsphere fabrication.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Droplet Formation Dynamics
The formation
of droplets could be divided into four stages, as shown in Figure 2a. First, the size
of the droplet increases with the ink jetting followed by the necking
stage when the droplet keeps growing. In the third stage, the droplet
falls off when reaching the force balance. Finally, the droplet becomes
a sphere under the surface tension. The time interval of droplet formation
is 290 ms when the inlet pressure is 0.020 MPa, and the flow rate
is 200 μL min–1. Figure 2b shows the relationship between inlet pressure
and the diameter of microspheres. The diameter of microspheres decreases
with the increment of inlet pressure. Our previous study has demonstrated
that the oxides increase the surface tension of the ink.37 As a result, the diameter could be tuned from
0.5 to 3.5 mm. Benefiting from the low viscosity of the continuous
phase (air), the fabrication of microspheres can be operated at a
higher flow rate, which could achieve the rapid fabrication of graphene
microspheres. The maximum flow rate of the ink phase (i.e., the production
yield of 3D graphene microspheres) can reach 800 μL min–1. For comparison, the flow rate of the traditional
liquid–liquid microfluidic method is only 2 μL min–1.31

200 μL min–1; inlet pressure = 0.020 MPa).

2.2 Material Characterization
The X-ray
diffraction patterns of the GM, GB, and GO are shown in Figure 3a to give the crystal information
of these samples. The peak at 10° of GO corresponds to the typical
peak of GO, and it relates to the (001) reflection of graphite oxides.
The peaks at 25° in patterns of GM and GB are related to the
(002) crystalline plane of carbon (JCPDS no. 26-1077).38 Raman spectra in Figure 3b show the structure information of the GM
and GB. Two remarkable peaks show in the spectra of both samples.
The peaks at 1593 and 1352 cm–1 of the GM are assigned
to the G band and D band. The G band is a typical feature of graphene,
which is related to the stretching vibration of sp2 carbon
atoms. The D band is caused by the defects and functional groups in
the graphene structure.39 The D band and
G band of GB samples are at 1357 and 1592 cm–1.
There is no noticeable shift of peaks, thus it could be concluded
that the GM and GB samples have the same graphene structure.

Figure 3 (a) XRD pattern of GO/GM/GB. (b) Raman spectra of GM/GB.

Figure 4 shows the
morphology and porosity microstructure of the GM and GB. The fabricated
microspheres are found to be well-shaped with an average diameter
of 1 mm (Figure 4a,b).
A highly porous sponge microstructure is detected within GMs. The
pore size is in the magnitude of 10–6 m. The picture
and microstructure images of the original GB are shown in Figure 4c,d as well. The
results indicate that no morphology change is observed between the
GM and GB.

Figure 4 (a) Image of GMs, (b) SEM image of the porous structure
in GMs, (c) image of GB, and (d) SEM image of the porous structure
in GB.

Figure 5a shows the results of nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and
pore size distribution. The calculated specific surface areas through
the BET model for the GM and GB are 159 and 206 m2 g–1, respectively. It could be figured out that, the
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm curves for both
GMs and GB show the feature of type-IV isotherms with hysteresis loops
with a relative pressure between 0.45 and 1.0, which indicates that
both materials are mesoporous.

Figure 5 (a) N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and
pore size distributions. (b) DTA curves.

The size distribution of mesopores
calculated by the BJH method is presented in Figure 5a. The average pore size of the GM is 8.0
nm, and the pore volume is 0.3196 cm3 g–1. Meanwhile, the average pore size of GB is 10.9 nm, and the pore
volume is 0.5780 cm3 g–1. It can be found
that the surface area of GB is lightly higher than that of GMs, while
the average pore size and pore volume of GMs are smaller than the
ones of GB. This is attributed to the fact that the surface area of
calcium alginate is smaller than that of graphene. On the other hand,
the calcium alginate framework shrank during the hydrothermal treatment,
which could lead to a decrease in the volume of graphene microspheres
and therefore the reduction in the pore size and pore volume as well.

Figure 5b gives
the results of the differential thermal gravity (DTG) analysis for
various samples fabricated. It is found that the graphene oxides (GOs)
experience two weightloss stages. The first stage occurs from 150
to 250 °C, which can be attributed to the surface oxygen-containing
functional group being oxidized.40,41 Meanwhile,
the second stage is recorded from 510 to 660 °C, owing to graphene
oxidization.42 For the GM, two stages of
weightloss are also detected. The weight loss between 390 and 490
°C is attributed to the oxidation of calcium alginate, resulting
in the loss of oxygen-containing functional groups on its surface.43 The weightloss from 490 to 680 °C is attributed
to graphene oxidization. In contrast, GB shows a different DTG characterization
with only one stage, that is, 490 to 700 °C, caused by graphene
oxidization.

FTIR spectrograms are shown in Figure 6 to help understand the surface
functional groups of the samples. The peaks at 3430 cm–1 are attributed to −OH stretching vibration, and the peaks
at 1623 cm–1 mark the C=C skeletal stretching
vibration.44 The peaks at 1730 cm–1 are assigned to C=O stretching vibration, and peaks at 1413
cm–1 are ascribed to O=C—O stretching
vibration. Peaks at 1225 cm–1 mark C–OH stretching
vibration. Peaks at 1114 cm–1 correspond to C–O
stretching vibration.45 Peaks at 600 cm–1 reflect the C–H bending vibration.46 It is obvious that the oxygen-containing functional
groups of GB and GM samples are less than those of the GO sample.
It is because the carbonyl and hydroxy groups on the GO surface are
reduced by hydrothermal treatment. The existence of abundant oxygen-containing
functional groups indicates that the three samples are negatively
charged on the surface, which is profitable for the dye adsorption.47 Besides, the results indicate that the GM sample
shows almost the same peaks with the GB sample, which means the species
of oxygen-containing functional groups of the GM and GB are similar.
It is also concluded that the addition of the template does not change
the surface functional groups on the graphene material. It should
be noted that the peak intensities of the GM sample are higher than
those of the GB sample, which indicated that the amount of oxygen-containing
functional groups on the surface of the GM is larger than that of
GB. The oxygen-containing functional groups are believed to play a
crucial role in decolorating.48

2.3 Adsorption Performance
To investigate
the selective adsorption performance of GMs and GB for cationic and
anionic pollutants, cationic methylene blue (MB) and anionic methyl
orange (MO) are chosen as target contaminants. Figure 7a shows the effect of the initial concentration
of contaminants on adsorption performance. It can be found that the
adsorption capacities for both MO and MB increase along with the initial
concentration and reach a plateau at approximately 300 mg L–1. The maximum adsorption capacity of GM is 596 mg/g for MB and 65
mg/g for MO. The adsorption capacity of MB microspheres is 13% higher
than that of the graphene sponge reported in the literature (526 mg
g–1),49 which is among
the highest adsorption capacities for 3D-geometric graphene adsorbents.
As for GB, the maximum adsorption capacities for MB and MO are 492
and 170 mg g–1, respectively. The results show that
the adsorption capacity of GMs for MB is 21% higher than that of GB.
This is attributed to the addition of SA, which could introduce the
favorable oxygen-containing functional groups for MB adsorption. Beyond
that, the GM sample shows great selective adsorption properties. Herein,
a ratio of adsorption capacities for MB and MO, that is, R, is defined to clarify the selective performance of the graphene-based
material as shown in eq 1. 1  

Figure 7 (a) Maximum adsorption capacity for MB and MO. (b) UV–vis
spectrum of the separation of MB and MO dyes.

The values of R for GMs and GB are 9.15 and 2.89, respectively. Furthermore, Figure 7b shows the separated
adsorption results. Comparing with GB, the GM exhibits a much higher
MB removal capacity. After the treatment of the GM, the major contaminant
left in the solution is MO. Meanwhile, both MB and MO exist in the
solution after the treatment of GB. The results prove the unique selective
adsorption property of GMs.

It should also be noticed that the
selective adsorption performance has been intensified remarkably benefiting
from the addition of SA. The reason for the excellent adsorption and
selectivity property could be explained by the electrostatic interaction
of π–π bonds and surface functional groups. The
π–π bonds are the major interaction force, which
is abundant in the graphene planar structure. Otherwise, the C=O/O—C=O
bonds are also favorable for MB adsorption due to their negative-charge
nature.48 As discussed in Section 2.3, the FTIR spectrum shows
that the amounts of π–π bonds and oxygen-containing
functional groups on the GM surface are higher than those on the GB
sample, which result in the improvement of the adsorption capacity
of MB. This is because the O—C=O and −OH bonds
on the chain structure of SA were introduced in the GM. However, it
is notable that the −OH bonds do not contribute to the MB adsorption
due to the steric hindrance.50 As a result,
the adsorption performance of graphene microspheres is mainly attributed
to C=O and O—C=O groups. Likewise, the negative-charge
nature of C=O/O—C=O bonds on the GM shows repulsion
to MO adsorption. Thus, the GM presents a highly selective adsorption
performance.

2.4 Adsorption Isotherm Modeling
The
adsorption isotherms of MB via GMs and GB are shown in Figure 8. The adsorption isotherm is
used to reveal the bond mode of the target molecule and absorbent.
The equilibrium adsorption parameters are modeled with the Langmuir
and Freundlich isotherm models.51

Figure 8 (a) Langmuir model of adsorption isotherms. (b) Freundlich
model of adsorption isotherms.

The Langmuir isotherm model describes an adsorption process that
the target molecule occupies only one adsorption site, and the adsorption
sites are homogeneous on the adsorbent surface.52 The linear equation of the Langmuir isotherm model is shown
in eq 2 as follows. 2  where Ce is the concentration of equilibrium (mg L–1), Qe is the capacity of equilibrium
(mg g–1), Qm is the
maximum capacity (mg g–1), and KL is the Langmuir constant (L mg–1).
The fitting results of the Langmuir isotherm model are shown in Figure 8a, and the parameters
are listed in Table 1.

Table 1 Langmuir and Freundlich Isotherm Parameters
of MB Adsorption on Graphene
 	 	Langmuir	Freundlich	
graphene	T (K)	Qm (mg g–1)	KL (L mg–1)	R2	RL	KF	n	R2	
GM	298	595	0.178	0.9989	0.0111–0.2809	343.95	10.66	0.9119	
GB	298	488	0.301	0.9985	0.0066–0.1425	340.17	15.2	0.9770	
The Freundlich isotherm model expresses the heterogeneous
adsorption process, which assumes that the multilayer adsorption occurs
on the absorbent surface. The linear equation of the Freundlich isotherm
model is given in eq 3. 3  where Qe is the capacity of equilibrium (mg g–1), Ce is the concentration of equilibrium (mg L–1), and KF (L mg–1) and n are the Freundlich constants, which relate
to the adsorption capacities and favorable adsorption process.53 The fitting results of the Langmuir isotherm
model are shown in Figure 8b, and the parameters are listed in Table 1. It is found that the adsorption process
of GB follows the Langmuir isotherm model with the regression coefficient R2 of Langmuir being 0.999 and 0.999, compared
to the ones of the Freundlich isotherm model, 0.912 and 0.977. The
results indicate that the active sites on the surface of the graphene
microsphere and graphene bulk are uniform, and the MB molecules are
adsorbed homogeneously. It can be also confirmed that the adsorption
of MB on the surface of adsorbents is monolayer adsorption.54 The maximum adsorption capacities of MB calculated
via the slope of the Langmuir fitting model are 595 and 488 mg g–1, which match well with the experimental data. In
addition, another critical parameter of the Langmuir isotherm model
is the dimensionless constant separation factor (RL), which can be calculated by eq 4, which is used to describe the adsorption
process. The adsorption process is normally considered effective when RL is between 0 and 1.55 4  where KL is the Langmuir constant (L mg–1) and C0 is the initial concentration of MB solution (mg L–1). The calculation results are recorded in Table 1. The RL value
of the GM is in the range of 0.0111–0.2809, and that of GB
is in the range of 0.0066–0.1425. The RL values of both absorbents are between 0 and 1, which suggested
that the absorbents are favorable for adsorption of the MB dye.

2.5 Adsorption Kinetics
In order to give
more insights on the adsorption process, batch adsorption experiments
are carried out for adsorption kinetics and mechanism analysis. The
influence of contact time is displayed in Figure 9a. The adsorption capacity increases sharply
before 90 min, but from 90 to 400 min, the adsorption speed decreases.
The adsorption capacity almost reaches a maximum value at 400 min.
The decoloration process is also displayed in Figure 9a. To analyze the adsorption kinetics, the
pseudo-first-order model (eq 5) and pseudo-second-order model (eq 6) are applied to fit the kinetics data.25,56

Figure 9 (a) Kinetic curves. (b) Pseudo-first-order model. (c)
Pseudo-second-order model. (d) Intraparticle diffusion model of MB
adsorption on the graphene microsphere.

Pseudo-first-order model: 5  Pseudo-second-order model: 6  where Qe (mg g–1) is the capacity of equilibrium, t is the contacting time (min), Qt (mg g–1) is the capacity at t min, and k1 and k2 (g mg–1 min–1) are the
pseudo-first-order model and the pseudo-second-order model constants,
respectively.

The fitting results are shown in Figure 9b,c, and the kinetic parameters
are listed in Table 2. The results suggested that the adsorption process follows the pseudo-second-order
model. Moreover, the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacity (319
mg g–1) is closer to the experimental value (306
mg g–1).

Table 2 Kinetic Parameters of the Pseudo-First-
and Second-Order Kinetic Models and Intraparticle Model
 	 	pseudo-first-order model	pseudo-second-order model	
graphene	T (K)	k1 (min–1)	Qe (mg g–1)	R2	k2 (g mg–1 h–1)	Qe (mg g–1)	R2	
GM	298	0.01674	188	0.955	7.877 × 10–5	319	0.999	
In order to describe the MB diffusion
mechanism, the intraparticle diffusion model is adapted to fit the
adsorption process data.57 The intraparticle
diffusion model is given in eq 7 as follows. 7  where Qt (mg g–1) is the capacity at t min, kip is the intraparticle diffusion
model rate constant, and C is the intercept, which
shows the thickness of the boundary layer. The linear fitting curve
is shown in Figure 9d, and the fitting parameters of the intraparticle diffusion model
are presented in Table 3.The process can be divided into two stages.58 In the first stage, the slope is higher than in the second stage,
which suggests a faster MB adsorption in this stage. On the other
hand, the intercept C does not equal to 0, which
indicates that the diffusion process is determined by not only intraparticle
diffusion but also other processes such as boundary-layer adsorption
and surface adsorption.58 With the occupation
of active adsorption sites, the adsorption speed slows down. In the
second stage, the diffusion process enters a gradual stage. The MB
molecules almost occupy all active sites, and the adsorption process
reaches equilibrium.

The adsorption–desorption experiments
were carried out to test the recyclability performance of the GM.
Five milligrams of GM was added into a 20 mL MB solution of 200 mg
L–1. As shown in Figure 10, the absorption performance decreases along
with the number of cycles and remains at 25.2% after five regeneration
cycles.

solution of 200 mg L–1.

3 Conclusions
The graphene microsphere
with a 3D porous structure is rapidly fabricated through a gas–liquid
based microfluidic method, and the diameter of the microsphere can
be easily tuned by gas pressure. The yield can reach up to 800 μL
min–1, which is far beyond the yield of the liquid–liquid
method (1–2 μL min–1), and the morphology
is stable and uniform. The GM shows great adsorption properties. The
maximum capacity for MB of GMs is 596 mg g–1, which
is almost 21% higher than that of graphene (GB) reduced by a traditional
hydrothermal method with VC. It is also found that MB presents the
highest adsorption performance in the reduced graphene oxides’
adsorption research. On the other hand, the capacity for MO is 65
mg g–1, which is 62% lower than that of graphene
(GB) reduced by the traditional hydrothermal method with VC. The selectivity
reflects in the different values of adsorption of anionic dye MO and
cationic dye MB. In detail, the GM adsorption property for the cationic
dye is enhanced, while the adsorption property for the anionic dye
is restrained. This phenomenon can be applied for separation of anionic
and cationic dyes, which shows a new approach for waste-sorting treatment.
According to isothermal adsorption study, the adsorption process follows
the Langmuir isothermal adsorption, which indicates that the MB molecules
are adsorbed homogeneously and distributed in the monolayer. The adsorption
kinetics of the GM fits the pseudo-second-order model suggesting the
adsorption process controlled by a chemical action. According to the
diffusion mechanism research, the intraparticle diffusion is not the
only rate-controlling step, and some other mechanisms such as boundary-layer
adsorption are involved. In summary, this study provides a new solution
for mass production of graphene functional materials at large scales
with well-controlled microstructures and surface properties, which
showed superior performance in applications such as environmental
remediation and selective separations.

4 Materials and Method
4.1 Apparatus and Materials
Natural graphite
flakes with a size of 300 mesh (0.05 mm) are used as a precursor to
produce graphene. The chemicals (37.5% HCl, 98% H2SO4, 30% H2O2, NaNO3, CaCl2, KMnO4, and ethanol) were purchased from Shanghai
Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. l-Ascorbic acid, methylene blue,
and methyl orange were purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd. Sodium alginate was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation.
The nozzle was fabricated through a 3D printer provided by B9Creator
(model B9C-BLACK V1.2). The syringe pump and the constant pressure
pump used in the experiments are from Longer Precision Pump Co., Ltd.
(model LSP02-1B) and Suzhou Wenhao Microfluidic Technology Co., Ltd.
(Model WH-PMPP15), respectively. The air compressor is from ASL (model
MOD 0930.2.2).

4.2 Preparation of Porous Graphene Microspheres
Graphene oxides are synthesized from natural graphite powder through
a modified Hummer’s method.59 The
graphene oxide ink is prepared as follows. First, 0.5 g of sodium
alginate (SA) is dissolved into a 50 mL graphene oxide solution of
6 mg mL–1, and then the mixed solution is kept in
a water bath at 323 K for 1 h. In this procedure, the sodium alginate
is used as the template of the porous framework. The nozzle used to
produce microspheres is manufactured by a 3D printer using B9R-2-Black
resin. The design of the nozzle is kept the same as in our previous
work.38Figure 1b shows the synthesis procedure where the
as-prepared graphene oxide ink is sheared by the air flow via an inkjet
nozzle to form microspheres. The gas-phase pressure is set to 0.015
MPa, corresponding to a flow rate of 50 mL min–1, and then the microspheres are solidified in 10% CaCl2 solution for 12 h where the sodium alginate cross-links with Ca2+ to form calcium alginate gel and the calcium alginate gel
becomes the framework of graphene microspheres, as shown in Figure 1b. The obtained microspheres
are then rinsed under deionized water (DI water). The graphene oxide
microspheres are reduced in l-ascorbic acid through the hydrothermal
method to generate graphene microspheres (GMs). In detail, 10 mL of
graphene oxide microspheres, 0.5 g of l-ascorbic acid, and
50 mL of DI water are added into a Teflon autoclave then the mixture
is reacted in an oven under 453 K for 24 h. The GMs are rinsed by
ethanol and DI water three times then dried in a freeze dryer for
further use. For comparison, graphene oxide microspheres that have
not been cured by sodium alginate are also prepared and reduced by
the hydrothermal method to produce graphene bulk (GB). A 60 mL (6
mg mL–1) graphene oxide solution with 0.5 g of l-ascorbic acid is added into the Teflon autoclave and reacted
in an oven under 453 K for 24 h. The products are rinsed with ethanol
and DI water and then dried in a freeze dryer. The unreduced graphene
oxide microspheres are named GO.

4.3 Characterization of Materials
The
formation process of droplets is recorded by high-speed camera Motion
Xtra N4 (Integrated Device Technology), and the frequency is 200 Hz.
The microstructures and morphologies of the GM and GB are characterized
by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-3400 N). X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the GM, GB, and GO are acquired by a rotating anode
X-ray powder diffractometer (Ragaku, 18KW/D/ max2550VB/PC) with monochromatic
Cu Kα radiation, and the data of 2θ is scanned from 5°
to 75° at a scan rate of 0.02° min–1.
Raman spectroscopy is done on the laser micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw
inVia reflex) at the range of 500–2500 cm–1 under the excitation wavelength of 514 nm and used for supplementary
structure information analysis together with XRD. The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) is carried out on a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 thermogravimetric
analyzer, and the samples are heated from room temperature to 800
°C at a rate of 10 °C min–1. Nitrogen
adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K are performed on 3H-2000PS4
from BeiShiDe Instrument Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. The specific
surface area is calculated via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) model, and the pore size distribution is attained via the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) model. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra are collected
in the range of 500–4000 cm–1 on a Nicolet
6700 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer.

4.4 Batch Adsorption Experiment
To investigate
the selective adsorption performance of GMs and GB, cationic methylene
blue (MB) and anionic methyl orange (MO) are chosen as the target
organic pollutants. The effect of the initial concentration of methylene
blue (MB) and equilibrium adsorption isotherms is determined in a
batch adsorption experiment. The initial MB concentrations vary from
20 to 500 mg L–1. The 5 mg adsorbent is added into
a 20 mL MB solution, which is kept stirred for 12 h at 298 K. Then,
the solution is filtered by nylon filter membranes to remove the adsorbent.
The concentration of residual MB is detected via its absorbance at
664 nm on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (TU-1901, Beijing Purkinje
General Instrument Co., Ltd). Finally, the adsorption capacity is
calculated through eq 8. 8  where Qe (mg g–1) is the adsorption capacity at
equilibration, C0 (mg L–1) is the initial MB concentration, Ce is the residual MB concentration at equilibration, V (L) is the volume of the initial MB solution, and m (g) is the weight of the adsorbent. In comparison, the adsorption
experiments for MO are carried out through the same procedures. The
concentration of residual MO is determined via its UV–vis absorbance
at 464 nm.

Moreover, the adsorption kinetics is investigated
by varying the adsorption time. In detail, 5 mg of the adsorbent is
added into a 20 mL MB solution of 100 mg L–1. The
concentration of MB is measured at different time intervals. The adsorption
capacity is calculated through eq 9. 9  where Qt (mg g–1) denotes the adsorption capacity
at a certain time, C0 (mg L–1) is the initial MB concentration, Ct refers to the residual MB concentration at a certain time, V (L) stands for the volume of the initial MB solution,
and m (g) is the weight of the adsorbent.

Experiments
on selective adsorption of ionic and anionic pollutants are carried
out to study the separation performance. Five milligrams of the adsorbent
is mixed with 20 mL of MB and MO of 50 mg L–1, respectively.
The solutions are kept stirred for 12 h at 298 K. The residual concentrations
of MO and MB are measured in the spectrum scanning mode of the UV–vis
spectrophotometer in the range of 350–750 nm.

To investigate
the recyclability performance of GMs, the used GM was eluted with
methanol and 0.5 M CaCl2 and washed subsequently with DI
water. Then, the sample was lyophilized to remove the water.
