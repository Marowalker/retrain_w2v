Squalene
is an isoprenoid compound that acts as the intermediate
metabolite in cholesterol synthesis. Squalene is not very susceptible
to peroxidation, and it quenches singlet oxygen in the skin, which
is caused by UV exposure and other ionizing radiation sources. Squalene
is a precursor to phytosterol synthesis, and it has been widely studied
for its ability to reduce oxidation, cancer activity, and cholesterol
levels. We performed a genome-wide association study for squalene
in rice using 1.6 million high-quality SNPs extracted from 295 accessions’
resequencing data. The candidate gene locus Os09g0319800—an
orthologue of terpene synthase in Arabidopsis—showed
up as the most likely candidate gene amongst the identified loci.
Nucleotide variations in the promoter were associated with squalene
content variations within the japonica group. The
results of this study can provide clues for understanding the mechanisms
of squalene biosynthesis in rice.

==== Body
Introduction
Squalene, which is
beneficial to human health, is contained in
rice that is consumed by a large population. Genetic studies related
to the squalene content of rice are valuable for high squalene-containing
rice breeding. Squalene is a natural triterpene hydrocarbon known
for its key role as a precursor in phytosterol or cholesterol synthesis,
as well as all steroids in plants, animals, and humans.1 Squalene can be obtained from many plants, including
olive oil, palm oil, wheat-germ oil, soybean oil, rice, Amaranthus
grains, and even the livers of sharks.2−5

Squalene has received much scientific
attention due to the beneficial
effects of its natural products in the context of human health. It
has been used in cosmetics, medicine, moisturizing ingredients, functional
food applications, as a immunologic adjuvant, and for protection against
carcinogenesis, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.6−8 Squalene has been identified in vitro and in animal studies to have
anticancer, antioxidant, drug carrier, detoxification, and skin hydration
effects.9 Devarenne et al.10 reported that the highest level of squalene synthase is
found in the apical meristem of tobacco. Compounds that perform important
biological functions structurally related to squalene also exist in
nature.11 For example, animals use quinyl
groups to form ubiquinone side chains, in which ubiquinone coenzyme
Q10 (CoQ10) has an antioxidant effect in the human body.12 Similar to squalene, substances that require
a prenyl group include carotene; vitamins A, K, D, and E; tocopherols;
tocotrienols; cyclic terpenoid compounds; and dolichol.13 The formula for squalene structures is C30H50, and it is enzymatically collapsed into three
interconnected, closed, six-carbon rings attached to a five-carbon
ring, which includes a prenyl side-chain. This squalene synthesis
starts with the production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme
A (HMG CoA). From the onset, the reduction of HMG CoA leads to the
formation of mevalonate.13 Squalene also
plays an important role as a precursor to phytosterol, which has a
positive human physiological effect. The three phytosterols that are
commonly found in plants, are β-sitosterol, campesterol, and
stigmasterol.14 They are essential natural
plant components that are rich in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and
grains and exist in plant sterol-enriched margarine.15,16 Phytosterols have also been suggested to have anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory,
and anticarcinogenic benefits, and their cholesterol-lowering abilities
are most widely researched.17 Numerous
studies indicate that plant sterols hinder cholesterol absorption
in the intestines and thereby lower the levels of total low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) and plasma cholesterol.17 The intestines absorb plant sterols poorly (0.4–3.5%) and
plant stanols even more so (0.02–0.3%).18 Campesterol in brassinosteroids has been identified as
a precursor for biosynthesis in developing seeds, a phytohormone class
that manages integral embryonic steps.19 In addition, phytosterols from rice bran appeared at over 40%, impacting
their use in the food industry and for human health purposes.20 Apart from their effects on lipid metabolism,
plant phytosterols can affect other metabolic processes. While concentrations
of campesterol are approximately three times higher than those of
sitosterol, the focus of most studies has remained on the metabolic
effects of sitosterol. Phytosterols are a group of triterpenes from
lipids (C30), present in all plant tissues.21,22 Phytosterols in cultivated rice were found to possess the highest
concentration of sitosterol, whereas stigmasterol and campesterol
were detected at lower levels.23 According
to Kumar et al.,24 β-sitosterol was
found in N22 (drought tolerant) rice seedlings.

The fact that
squalene is included in rice is important because
more than half of the global population relies on rice, which is a
primary staple in several parts of the world, particularly in Asia.25,26 Rice’s nutritional qualities represent a significant factor
in the consumer choice, especially in developing countries, where
rice is the primary source of some essential nutrients.27 On a global scale, rice provides energy (21%)
and protein (15%) to humans. Improving its valuable nutrient contents,
which would have important health benefits for humans, has long been
a target of rice breeding programs.

However, only a limited
number of genetic studies have addressed
squalene content in rice. Most research has been conducted using the
plant model, Arabidopsis. Fortunately, today, many
techniques have been developed to search for squalene-releated genes
by correlating phenotypical traits with single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in the genome. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) is
one of the techniques that is utilized to efficiently produce analysis
of the genetic diversity of complex traits’ architecture and
provide valuable initial insights into candidate genes or loci for
subsequent validation.28 Han et al.29 also found that the GWAS represents an effective
means for the exploration of the genetic architecture of phenolic
compounds in both cultivated and Tibetan wild barley. In addition,
Volante et al.30 utilized GWAS to study japonica rice fields under both permanent flooding (PF)
and limited water (LW) conditions. The GWAS was presented to map genes/loci
resistant to rice blast in open-access rice diversity panel 1 (RDP1).31 Hence, the dissection of plant biosynthetic
pathways has experienced rapid advancement due to a wide range of
valuable tools: whole-genome sequencing; high throughput physical
mapping; global gene expression analysis; and metabolite profiling
in a variety of organisms. Combining these approaches allows for fast
access to and the development of essential biochemical information
in model systems, as well as the efficient bridging of the information/research
gap between agricultural crops and engineering pathways, i.e., those
for micronutrients, in global staple crops. Wang et al.32 performed the GWAS of vitamin E for methyltransferase
(OsγTMT) and α-tocopherol,
which were found in 13 rice candidate genes. Furthermore, Li et al.33 used the GWAS for SNP identification and insertion/deletions
(indels) linked to α-tocopherol content in kernels of maize.

We investigated the squalene content of 295 rice core sets, performed
the GWAS using SNPs from resequencing, and found candidate genes that
were associated with squalene content. Of these, Os09g0319800, an
orthologue of terpene synthase in Arabidopsis, was
found to be the most possible candidate gene amongst the identified
loci. Our GWAS on squalene will contribute to understanding the mechanism
of nutrient biosynthesis and providing a foundation to future studies
on breeding rice with high squalene content.

Results and Discussion
Phenotypic
Evaluation and Correlation among Individuals
We observed
significant phenotype variation between the japonica and indica varieties in terms of the tochromanol
content. We considered whether there was a similar pattern of correlation
between the ecotype and the nutrient content in terms of squalene
and its derivatives, the phytosterols. It was surprising to discover
that there were distinctive differences between the japonica and indica groups with respect to their squalene
and phytosterol contents, except for campesterol, with p < 0.01. The other three components all had p values lower than 0.001 (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Statistical analysis of squalene and phytosterol contents
between japonica and indica rice
from 295 accessions.
**: significant difference at p < 0.01, and ***:
significant difference at p < 0.001.

Population Structure
The 295 accessions and population
structure were identical to those identified in ref (32). For the 295 accessions,
four subgroups, temperate japonica, tropical japonica, aus, and indica, were separated with some admixed accessions, where K = 4 (Figure S1). At K = 2, the 295 accessions were separated into two groups represented
by indica and japonica. The japonica group was divided into temperate japonica and tropical japonica at K = 3.
Temperate japonica was divided into two parts, one
composed of bred varieties at K = 4. The aus type was separated from indica at K = 5, and the four subgroups were finally well separated
from each other. For the 295 accessions together, the same patterns
were observed as in the 137 accessions. It is worth mentioning that
our temperate japonica varieties were divided into
two parts at K = 4, which indicated a relatively
complicated genetic background within our japonica varieties.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Based on phylogenetic
tree and structure results, the four major ecotype groups separated
well from each other.32 Utilizing 1.6 million
high-quality SNPs, we performed a PCA. According to the parallel analysis,
the scree plot suggested a component number of two. Based on the first
two PCs, we observed clear subpopulation structures. The two subpopulations, indica and japonica, were well differentiated,
with clear clusters based on the first two PCs and with the admixture
accessions situated between the two groups.32 Furthermore, temperate and tropical japonica clustered
separately, as did aus and indica. For the phenotype, we examined the correlation between the different
subgroups using squalene and phytosterol contents. We applied the
R package “psych” for a PCA of squalene and phytosterol
contents in 295 accessions.34 Parallel
analysis suggested that the number of factors and components were
three and two, respectively (Figure S2).
We therefore performed the PCA with two components. Based on squalene
and phytosterol contents, all rice accessions in our study clustered
into two groups, composed of indica and japonica subspecies (Figure S3). These genetic
and phenotypic variations suggested that genetic factors underlay
squalene and phytosterol content-level differences between the indica and japonica groups.

GWAS of Squalene
Content in indica, japonica, and
the Entire Population using 295 Accessions
We studied genome-wide
association with squalene content, an important
precursor of phytosterols. The GWAS was performed using the 137 accessions
and 158 Korean-bred varieties together. We used the same 1.6 million
high-quality SNPs without missing data across all this study’s
accessions. Similarly, to determine the existence of different allelic
networks associated with trait variations within the differing subpopulations,
we conducted the GWAS to analyze association signals in indica (72 total accessions), japonica (217 total accessions),
and entire rice populations. Since most accessions from the 158 Korean-bred
varieties (temperate japonica: n = 133, tropical japonica: n =
3, indica:n = 21, and admixture: n = 1) belonged to the japonica type, more
than 130 japonica were added into the panel, while
only 21 indica were added. We assumed that the 295
accessions’ association panel was closer to a japonica panel and therefore japonica varieties’
mapping power was increased. For the entire population, the genome-wide
significance threshold was set as p < 1 ×
10–6 considering the sample size. There were three
significantly associated signals—located on chromosomes 6,
9, and 10—in the entire population panel (Figure 2). In the japonica population, the genome-wide significance threshold was set as p < 1 × 10–5, and two associated
signals—which had identical genomes located to signals identified
from the entire population on chromosomes 9 and 10—were found.
We did not find significant association signals from the indica panel (Figure 2).
Only squalene GWAS results showed significant association signals
in this study. The candidate gene locus Os09g0319800—an orthologue
of terpene synthase in Arabidopsis—was the
most possible factor among the identified loci. Squalene is an isoprenoid
compound, which acts as an intermediate metabolite for cholesterol
and other steroid synthesis.9 Squalene
is not very vulnerable to peroxidation and quenches singlet oxygen
species in human skin, thereby protecting it from lipid peroxidation
due to exposure to UV and other ionizing radiation sources.

against the position on each of the 12 chromosomes. (a–c) Manhattan

We investigated significantly associated signals on chromosomes
6, 9, and 10. Signals located on chromosome 6 were only identified
in the entire population and appeared to be responsible for phenotype
variations amongst the indica and japonica groups. However, the false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p value was too high to be treated as an authentic candidate
gene locus (Table 1). Therefore, we excluded association signals on chromosome 6 for
further analysis. However, signals on chromosomes 9 and 10 were authentic
according to the results. We found certain gene loci, which could
be used for further analysis.

Identification
of Putative Nucleotide Polymorphisms for the
Squalene Content in Rice
Association signals derived from
the results for the 295 accessions’ panel, in which two of
the most significant signals were on chromosomes 9 and 10 (Figure 3). The peak SNP on
chromosome 9 was chr09:9097404, and chr10:10429128 on chromosome
10. We screened ∼50 kb around the peak SNP region for candidates,
using the International Rice Genome Annotation database. Two gene
loci around the peak SNP on chromosome 9: Os09g0319701 and Os09g0319800.
No detailed information on Os09g0319701 has been reported, and it
is annotated as a conserved hypothetical protein. Os09g0319800 is
a terpene synthase-like domain-containing protein, involved in squalene’s
biosynthesis pathway.35 The chr09:9097404
peak is located in Os09g0319800 and is associated with squalene biosynthesis.
Therefore, we chose Os09g0319800 as our candidate gene. We identified
three gene loci around the SNP on chr10:10429128: Os10g0346600, Os10g0347000,
and Os10g0347800. Os10g0346600 is annotated as a vacuolar sorting
receptor 4 precursor, which is related to calcium ion binding in Arabidopsis.36 Os10g0347000 is
annotated as an X8 domain-containing protein, which displayed functions
as glycosyltransferases.37 Os10g0347800
is annotated as a forminlike protein, associated with actin filament
formation and regulation in Arabidopsis.38 Unfortunately, none of the gene loci on chromosome
10 showed a direct connection with squalene biosynthesis, and thus,
only Os09g0319800 was chosen for further analysis.

Comparative Sequence Analysis for Os09g0319800
We sought
to identify if the homologous genes of Os09g0319800, from the near
range, exists in indica, which is another subspecies
of japonica, and wild rice (Oryza genus). We also extended the search to the monocotyledons (class
Liliopsida) and dicotyledons (class Magnoliopsida)

First, we
identified whether Os09g0319800 exists in indica through
BLAST and a public homologs database.39 The nucleotide BLAST querying the genomic DNA sequence of Os09g0319800
to the nucleotide collection (nr/nt) database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) showed that the best hit in indica was of E value = 4 × 10–77 and identity
= 81.68%, but query coverage = 14%. This result meant that the gene
corresponding to Os09g0319800 was not found in the indica genome in genomic DNA. The amino acid BLAST query of the non-redundant
protein sequence (nr) database with the amino acid sequence of Os09g0319800
revealed hypothetical protein OsI_15038 with E value
= 7 × 10–97, identity = 64.44%, and query coverage
= 73%.40 However, unlike Os09g0319800,
which is located on chromosome 9, the gene was located on chromosome
4. In the amino acid BLAST query of Os09g0319800, the japonica genes were also hit, including Os04g0178300 in chromosome 4 (E value = 4 × 10–98, identity = 60.47%,
and query coverage = 83%). Thus, OsI_15038 is considered to be a paralogous
gene of Os09g0319800. In another public database, Plants Ensembl (http://http://plants.ensembl.org), the reconciliated phylogenetic trees of the homologous genes of
Os09g0319800 showed no homologs in indica (Figure S4).41 Therefore,
Os09g0319800 is assumed to be a gene that does not exist in indica. It is interesting to note that the orthologs of
Os09g0319800 exist in many wild rice plants (Oryza
rufipogon, Oryza nivara, Oryza barthii, and Oryza glumipatula) (Figure S4).

Next, we identified the othologous genes of Os09g0319800
among
the plants in the class Liliopsida and Magnoliopsida using Plants
Ensembl. The result showed that Os09g0319800 also had a total of nine
high-confidence orthologous genes among four species in Liliopsida
and for the species in Magnoliopsida, including BnaAnng04000D from Brassica napus, which was present42 (Table S2). In Liliopsida, all
of the species were wild rice (Oryza genus) except Eragrostis tef, a cereal crop in Africa, that had
recently completed the whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic tree
reconstruction and been identified as a plant belonging to Chloridoideae.43

Functional Haplotype Analysis for Os09g0319800
Using
our resequencing data, we generated the promoter region and coding
region haplotypes for Os09g0319800. We identified a total of six haplotypes
combining the promoter and coding region sequences (Figure 4). The indica type was absent from the haplotype analysis, since all indica accession sequences were missing in this genomic region. No SNP
was present in the coding region of japonica varieties
compared to the reference sequence. Two types of coding regions, constituted
by a total of nine variant positions—seven of which lead to
amino acid substitution—were identified in aus varieties and some admixtures. The squalene content varied between
different haplotypes, types 1–3 composed of japonica type varieties had much higher squalene content than accessions
in types 4 and 5, which represented the aus type
and some admixtures. There were noticeable squalene content variations
between types 1 and 2, and only one SNP was found in the promoter
part between the two types. Type 3 carried five SNPs in the promoter
region and showed significant squalene content variations compared
to other japonica varieties. Therefore, we think
that promoter region SNPs in types 2 and 3 could be causing phenotypic
variations. Nucleotide variations in the promoter and coding regions
of aus type, and some of the admixtures, could be
responsible for squalene content differences compared to the japonica group.

Asia, especially East and Southeast Asia, are the
major rice cultivation
areas in the world. Rice is the major energy source for most people
in the developing countries of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Nutrient intake from rice represents the total dietary intake amount
for people in these countries. It was surprising to find significant
differences in squalene, phytosterols, and tocochromanol contents
between the different ecotypes. According to our results, compared
to the indica varieties, japonica varieties contained a much higher phytonutrients’ content,
which are indispensable for human health. Genetic factors must be
underlying this phenotypic variation, since there is a substantial
difference between japonica and indica varieties regarding their genetic background. Furthermore, noticeable
variations among subgroups (temperate japonica, tropical japonica, indica, and aus) were observed.
Dissection of variations in genes related to nutrient biosynthesis
in rice can facilitate the process of improving valuable compounds
through breeding activities, which could yield incredible benefits
for human health.

Experimental Section
Plant Materials
A total of 4406 varieties of rice exist
worldwide, collected by the National Genebank of the Rural Development
Administration (RDA-Genebank, Republic of Korea) and developed into
a core set of 166 rice accessions using the program PowerCore.44 Of these accessions, 137 were selected for the
resequencing project (Table S1), in addition
to 158 Korean-bred varieties. The experiment was conducted during
the rice-growing seasons of 2016 and 2017, at Kongju National University.
Each accession was transplanted in two rows, with 15 cm separating
each plant, and 30 cm separating each row. Field management followed
the standard agricultural practice, with each field replicated twice
in a completely randomized design. Young plant leaves were sampled
and then stored at −80 °C, until their use for genomic
DNA extraction using the CTAB method.45

Analysis of Squalene and Phytosterol Content
Squalene
and phytosterol samples were prepared for analyses using the procedures
described by Bhandari et al.,46 albeit
with some modifications. Fresh rice samples (5 g) were mixed with
20 mL of ethanol and 0.5 g of ascorbic acid as an antioxidant, followed
by shaking in a water bath at 80 °C for 10 min. Then, 600 μL
of 44% KOH were added in the saponification step, followed by shaking
at 80 °C for 18 min. The tubes were incubated on ice. Then, 10
mL of n-hexane and 10 mL of distilled water were
added and mixed, and the sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000
rpm, whereby we collected the upper hexane layer. This process was
repeated three times, and the collected hexane layers were pooled
and washed with 10 mL of distilled water a total of three times. The
samples were then passed through anhydrous Na2SO4 to remove water, concentrated using a rotary evaporator, dissolved
in 1 mL of isooctane, and injected into a GC instrument (GC 400 Varian)
with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (CP-SIL 8CB,
30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.4 μm film thickness). The injector and
detector (FID) temperatures were set at 290 °C, and the injection
volume was 1 μL, with a split ratio of 1:20 under a constant
column flow (1.0 mL min–1) of helium gas. The oven
temperature was initially set at 220 °C for 2 min; increased
to 290 °C with 5 min–1 and held for 14 min;
and then increased to 310 °C with 10 °C min–1 and held for 18 min.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analyses were performed
utilizing Microsoft Excel 2010 and SPSS (version 20.0). The Pearson
correlation coefficients between squalene and phytosterol contents,
as well as the correlations between the 2-year phenotype data, were
analyzed using SPSS (version 20.0). Statistical differences in squalene
and phytosterol contents between the japonica and indica groups were determined using Sigmaplot (version 12).

Whole-Genome Resequencing and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
(SNP) Calling
Each accession used genomic DNA from a single
plant. Total genomic DNA was extracted from young leaf tissue with
the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Rice varieties were sequenced
to obtain genomes with ∼8× coverage to detect SNPs. We
generated a total of 3900 million raw reads, which were aligned against
the rice reference genome (IRGSP 1.0) for SNP identification and genotype
calling. In total, 12.23 million SNPs and indels were obtained through
SNP calling. The genotype data set was generated for GWAS. Only SNPs
with minor allele frequency >5% that contained genotype calls for
all 137 accessions were used. Finally, GWAS utilized ∼1.6 million
high-quality SNPs.

Population Structure Analysis
We
conducted principal
component analysis (PCA), constructing a phylogenetic tree based on
the 1.6 million high-quality SNPs.47,48 The population
phylogenetic tree was constructed using PHYLIP (version 3.68), and
MEGA7 (version 7.0)49 was employed to display
the tree.50,51 Furthermore, we used the program ADMIXTURE
(version 1.3.0), which estimates individual ancestry and admixture
proportions, assuming that K populations exist based
on the maximum-likelihood method.52 We
also applied PCA to the phenotype data from 2013 using the R package
psych.34

Genome-Wide Association
Study (GWAS)
We performed the
GWAS utilizing the software genome association and prediction integrated
tool (GAPIT) (version 3.0).48 We then selected
the compressed mixed linear model (CMLM), which uses a kinship (K) matrix as the variance–covariance matrix between
individuals. An optimized number of principal components (PCs) was
obtained from the PCA results. We performed GWAS for 295 accessions
from the 137 core collection and 158 Korean-bred varieties.

Functional
Haplotype Analysis for Os09g0319800
Whole-genome
resequencing data for 295 rice accessions were imported into the TASSEL
(version 5.0)53 software to extract nucleotide
polymorphism. IRGSP 1.0 was employed as a reference genome for functional
haplotype analysis of the Os09g0319800 gene on chromosome 9—positioned
at 9 096 555–9 101 312 (+strand).
Sequences were aligned using MAGA7 (version 7.0).49 Haplotype diversity was analyzed utilizing DnaSP (version
6) software.
