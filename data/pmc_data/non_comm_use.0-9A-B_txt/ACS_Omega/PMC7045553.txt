Endophytic
fungi possess favorable effects on their host plants, including disease-resistance
improvement, secondary metabolite induction, and growth promotion.
It is therefore a promising and sustainable strategy to utilize endophytic
fungi for the quality improvement of medicinal herbs or important
crops. In our study, a collection of 277 strains of endophytic fungi
were isolated from Anoectochilus and Ludisia orchids. Two strains J162 and J211 can be
symbiotically cocultured with the tissue culture seedlings of Anoectochilus roxburghii, a popular medicinal and
edible plant in southern China. Both strains can significantly enhance
the biomass of A. roxburghii and induce
the biosynthesis and accumulation of its active ingredients, including
flavonoids, kinsenoside, and polysaccharides. J162 and J211 were further
identified as Chaetomium globosum and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides based on multilocus
phylogenetic analysis. Immunocytochemical staining indicated that
J162 and J211 mainly colonized the intercellular gap of xylem parenchyma
cells of A. roxburghii roots without
obvious harm. In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction showed that the expression of three growth-related genes,
namely, uracil phosphoribosyl transferase, amino acid transmembrane
transporter, and maturase K, were significantly altered in A. roxburghii plants when treated with J162 and J211.
In conclusion, the two strains are highly beneficial microbial resources
for the growth and accumulation of active ingredients of A. roxburghii in agricultural cultivation.

==== Body
Introduction
There are more than 15 Anoectochilus species (Orchidaceae family), widely distributed in Fujian, Taiwan,
Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Guangxi, from the south to the east and west
of China.1,2Anoectochilus roxburghii (Wall.) Lindl. is the most well-known medicinal and edible species
and the only officially designated origin of a valuable herb named
“Jinxianlian” in the “Standards of Chinese Medicinal
Materials of Fujian Province in China” (2006 Edition).3A. roxburghii,
also known as “Jewel Orchid”, is a reputed folk medicine
in southern China with high efficacy for the treatment of hypertension,
diabetes, and liver diseases,3,4 which also has nourishing
functions and widely used as tonic diet and tea in Fujian.5 Because of the lack of wild resources, many Anoectochilus, Goodyera, and Ludisia plants have also been
used as substitutes of A. roxburghii or even adulterants in local herbal markets and inevitably confused
with A. roxburghii because of their
morphological similarities.6 Environmental
deterioration and excessive human consumption aggravated the wild
resource destruction of A. roxburghii, which subsequently led to a low yield and short supply. Thus, it
is important to find some promising ways in facilitating plant growth
and enhancing the yield of bioactive metabolites to improve the total
quality of A. roxburghii.

Endophytes
are microorganisms that inhabit living plants without causing apparent
disease symptoms to the host. Previous studies have also shown that
endophytic fungi could benefit their hosts in different ways, such
as promoting germination and shoot growth and enhancing host plant
tolerance to biotic or abiotic stresses, as well as inducing bioactive
metabolite accumulation in host plants.7,8 In addition,
endophytes were widely used in agricultural cultivation, such as Oryza sativa L. and Oncidium hybridum.9,10

Previous studies have revealed that orchid
plants need to establish a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal
fungi to maintain their normal growth and development.11 Two unidentified strains of mycorrhizal fungi,
ASF-15 and ASF-18, were reported to significantly enhance the biomass
of the tissue culture seedlings of A. roxburghii.12 Two strains of Epulorhiza mycorrhizal fungi, MF-15 and MF-18, were found to promote the growth
and polysaccharide accumulation of A. roxburghii, while two strains of Mycena fungi,
MF-23 and MF-24, only enhanced the content of polysaccharides in A. roxburghii.13 The abovementioned
six strains of mycorrhizal fungi were not isolated from A. roxburghii but from other Orchidaceae plants.
To date, most reported beneficial fungal strains for A. roxburghii are exogenous mycorrhizal fungi rather
than endogenous strains, and little is known about the profiles and
functions of the endophytes in Anoectochilus and Ludisia species. What is more,
favorable evidence regarding the effects of endophytic fungi on the
accumulation of secondary metabolites in A. roxburghii is still limited and their functional significances remain unclear.
Therefore, in our study, the endophytic fungi harbored in healthy Anoectochilus and Ludisia plants were systematically isolated. All isolated strains were further
screened for their ability to promote the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana and A. roxburghii. The effects of these bioactive strains on the accumulation of secondary
metabolites in A. roxburghii were further
studied, and the underlying mechanism was also investigated to better
understand the role of endophytic fungi in host–microbe interactions.

Materials and Methods
Sample Collection
A total of ten batches of samples
(including five Anoectochilus and one Ludisia species) were collected from Guangxi, Jiangxi,
Yunnan, and Fujiang in China (Table S1).
All samples were authenticated by Dr. Zehao Huang, School of Pharmacy,
Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. All voucher specimens
were deposited in the Herbarium of Fujian University of Traditional
Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, China. The collected plants were placed
in plastic bags, transferred to the laboratory within 24 h, and stored
at 4 °C until the fungal isolation procedure was carried out.

Isolation of Endophytic Fungi
Plant surface sterilization and fungal isolation were carried out
according to the procedures described by Jia.14 Briefly, all plant samples were washed thoroughly with running tap
water to remove soil particles and then rinsed several times with
distilled water. The separated parts (roots, stems, leaves, and flowers; Figure S1) were successively immersed in 75%
ethanol solution for 4 min, then in 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution
for 4 min, followed by immersion in 75% ethanol solution for 30 s.
These surface-sterilized tissues were then rinsed four times with
sterile distilled water and subsequently dried with sterile filter
paper. Next, 0.5–1.0 cm pieces were cut from each tissue and
evenly placed on Petri dishes containing potato dextrose agar (PDA)
with 50 mg/L penicillin to inhibit bacterial growth. To validate the
effectiveness of surface sterilization, an aliquot of 0.3 mL of the
last rinsed water was also inoculated onto the PDA plates as a control.
The Petri dishes were incubated at 26 ± 2 °C for 7–14
days, and fungal growth was monitored daily. Each colony was subcultured
on new penicillin-free PDA medium for further purification. For long-term
storage, the fungal colonies were stored at −80 °C in
slant tubes containing PDA.

Initial
Screening of Growth-Promoting Strains Using A. thaliana
The sterilization of A. thaliana seeds, which were obtained from Prof. Meili Guo, School of Pharmacy,
Second Military Medical University, was carried out as follows. Briefly, A. thaliana seeds were immersed in 75% ethanol for
5 min and subsequently washed five times with sterile deionized water.
The seeds were then inoculated onto the 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS)
medium. An aliquot of 0.3 mL of the last rinsed water was inoculated
onto the 1/2 MS medium as a control to validate the effectiveness
of sterilization. After three days of seed vernalization at 4 °C,
the plates were incubated in a plant growth chamber under controlled
conditions (22 ± 2 °C, 16 h light/8 h dark cycle and a light
intensity of 2000 lux) for germination and growth.

To estimate
the effects of fungal inoculation on the plant growth of A. thaliana, a vertical agar plate (VAP) assay was
performed with six plants per plate, and each experiment was performed
in triplicate. On the 4th day after germination, A.
thaliana seedlings were inoculated with a 0.5 cm square
fungal plug punched from fungus-containing PDA or a sterile PDA piece
as a control. The fungal or PDA plug was placed at a 5 cm distance
from the primary root tip of A. thaliana. The plates were incubated vertically in the same plant growth chamber
as previously mentioned. After ten days of coculture, the root microstructure
was observed by using a biological microscope (Leica DM2500) at a
magnification of 50×, and the fresh weight, number of lateral
roots, and root length of A. thaliana seedlings were also calculated based on a manual measurement. Subsequently, A. thaliana seedlings were dried at 50 °C to
a constant weight to determine the dry weight.

Identification of Growth-Promoting Strains in the Initial Screening
Pure fungal colonies were selected for DNA extraction. DNA was
extracted from 100 mg mycelia chilled in liquid nitrogen by using
a Hi-DNA Secure Plant Kit (TIANGEN Biotech, Beijing, China) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The internal transcribed spacer
(ITS) region and the β-tubulin (TUB2), elongation factor 1-α
(EF-1α) were amplified with the primer pairs ITS4/ITS5, Bt2a/Bt2b,
and EFa/EFb which were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China).
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in a 50 μL
reaction mixture containing 2 μL template DNA, 1 μL forward
primer (10 μM), 1 μL reverse primer (10 μM), 25
μL 2× TransTap HiFi PCR SuperMix, and 21 μL double
distilled water (Table S4). The PCR cycling
protocol consisted of initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min,
followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 50 s, 54 °C for 50 s,
and 72 °C for 90 s, and a final elongation step at 72 °C
for 7 min (Table S5). The PCR-amplified
products without further purification were sequenced by Sangon Biotech
(Shanghai, China).

For strain identification, combined with
morphological observation, the ITS and the TUB2, EF-1α sequences
were compared with those submitted in the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using the BLAST search program. A phylogenetic tree was constructed
according to the maximum parsimony method using MEGA version 5.0 software
(http://www.megasoftware.net).15Postia caesia 12974 and Amesia nigricolor CBS 600.66 were used as outgroup
sequences, respectively.

Immunocytochemical
Staining of Fungal Infection in A. roxburghii
The immunocytochemical staining of the plant tissue was
performed as described by Zhai.16 Briefly,
a portion of the fresh root tissues of A. roxburghii were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for more than 24 h. Then, paraffin
sections of 4 μm were prepared according to the following procedures.
The slices were sequentially placed into dimethylbenzene xylene I
for 20 min, dimethylbenzene xylene II for 20 min, anhydrous ethanol
I for 10 min, anhydrous ethanol II for 10 min, 95% alcohol for 5 min,
90% alcohol for 5 min, 80% alcohol for 5 min, 70% alcohol for 5 min,
and distilled water for rinsing. The plant tissue sections were then
placed in a repair box filled with EDTA antigen repair buffer (pH
8.0) (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) for antigen repair in a microwave
oven with medium boiling for 5 min. After natural cooling, the slice
was placed into the PBS (pH 7.4) and washed for three times (5 min
each time) on the decoloring table. After the slices were spin-dried,
a circle was drawn on the center of the slice with a Pap Pen to prevent
the antibody from running off the slide. Then, 3% BSA was dropped
into the circle to cover the tissue evenly and hermetically stored
the sample at room temperature for 30 min. After shaking off the blocking
solution gently, the primary antibody [1:100 concanavalin A (GenBank
ID, 72333; Sigma) labeled with FITC fluorescence] was added, and the slice
was subsequently placed flat on the wet box and incubated at 4 °C
for 24 h. Then, the slice was transferred into PBS for decoloration
again. Subsequently, DAPI (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) was added to
the slice and coincubated in the dark for 10 min at room temperature.
Finally, the slice was decolored three times in PBS and sealed with
Antifade Mounting Medium (Servicebio, Wuhan, China), and their images
were collected by using a fluorescent inverted microscope (Nikon,
Japan).

Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography
and High Performance Liquid Chromatography Analysis of Bioactive Constituents
in A. roxburghii
The tissue
culture plants of A. roxburghii were
desiccated at 60 °C in the oven and then ground into a powder.
A total of 0.5 g of plant powder was accurately weighed and placed
in 50 mL centrifuge tubes. Subsequently, 25 mL of 70% methanol was
added into the centrifugal tube, and the gross weight was recorded.
After ultrasonic extraction for 45 min, the centrifuge tube was weighed
again, and the weight loss was made up with methanol. The sample solution
was filtered with a 0.22 μm syringe filter and subsequently
used for ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis of
flavonoid contents.

The UPLC analysis was performed on an Agilent-1290
UPLC system equipped with a Phenomenex Kinelex C18 100A chromatographic
column (100 mm × 2.10 mm, 1.7 μm) at 35 °C. The mobile
phase consisted of acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% formic acid in water
(B), and a gradient program (Table S6)
was used. The injection volume was 5 μL with a flow rate of
0.3 mL/min.

In HPLC–ELSD analysis of kinsenoside content,
0.5 g of plant powder was weighed and extracted with 100 mL methanol,
and other procedures in sample preparation were the same as those
described in UPLC analysis. The HPLC–ELSD system was equipped
with a Phenomenex NH2 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm).
An isocratic elution system of acetonitrile–water (92:8, v/v)
was adopted as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min, the
column temperature was 35 °C, the ELSD spray chamber temperature
was 70 °C, and the nitrogen flow rate was 1.5 L/min.

Determination of Polysaccharide Content in A. roxburghii
The polysaccharide content
in A. roxburghii was quantified by
the phenol–sulfuric acid method. A standard curve was established
as described by Chen et al.13 Briefly,
10 mg of glucose was accurately weighed and dissolved in 100 mL distilled
water as the standard solution. Then, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0,
1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 mL of standard solutions were drawn to
prepare different concentrations of glucose solutions in volumetric
flasks with a final volume of 2.0 mL. Subsequently, these solutions
were transferred to test tubes, and 1.0 mL of 6% phenol solution was
added to each tube. Then, the mixture was shaken after the quick addition
of 5.0 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid. The solution was then allowed
to stand for 20 min and subsequently react in a boiling water bath
for 10 min, after which the solution was quickly removed into the
iced water bath for 5 min and finally maintained at room temperature
for 30 min. The absorbance of the mixture was determined at 490 nm
in a 96-well plate using an absorbance microplate reader (BioTek Co.,
USA). All treatments were performed in triplicate.

A total of
120 mg of A. roxburghii powder was
accurately weighed and extracted with 20 mL distilled water in an
85 °C water bath. After filtration, 1.0 mL filtrate was drawn,
and 4.0 mL of anhydrous ethanol was added, which was then stored at
4 °C for 24 h. The precipitation of polysaccharide was collected
and washed with a small amount of 80% ethanol and dissolved in 2.0
mL of distilled water. To determine the polysaccharide content of
the tested samples, 1.0 mL of the sample solution from each group
was drawn, and then the phenol solution and sulfuric acid were added
as described before with a final volume of 2.0 mL. Standard solutions
of glucose and distilled water were regarded as the reference and
blank control, respectively. The results were calculated based on
the calibration curve and expressed as μg/mL.

Determination of the Activities of Three Enzymes
in A. roxburghii
Plant samples
were homogenized in precooled mortars using extracting solution according
to the protocol of the β-1,3-glucanase Activity Assay Kit (Solarbio,
Beijing, China), the Chitinase Activity Detection Kit, and the T-SOD
Activity Assay Kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing,
China). After centrifugation (12,000g for 10 min,
12,000g for 20 min, and 4,000g for
10 min, for β-1,3-glucanase, chitinase, and T-SOD, respectively),
the supernatants of the treated samples were collected and used as
enzyme extracts.

The enzyme extract was mixed with the corresponding
kit reagent to initiate the reaction, and then the absorptions of
different samples were measured on a microplate reader (BioTek Co.,
USA). All assays were performed in triplicate. β-1,3-glucanase
activity was assayed by measuring the rate of reducing sugar release
from laminarin as a substrate at 540 nm, and the enzyme activity was
expressed as U/g fresh weight. One unit of glucanase activity was
defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1.0 μM reducing
sugar equivalent, expressed as glucose, per hour. Chitinase activity
was assayed by a modified method recorded at 570 nm following the
kit instruction, and the enzyme activity was also expressed as U/g
fresh weight. In addition, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD)
was determined by measuring its ability to inhibit the photochemical
reduction of NBT. One unit of SOD activity is the amount of enzyme
that produces 50% inhibition on the rate of NBT reduction.

RNA Isolation and Real-Time Quantitative PCR
Analysis
The total RNA of A. roxburghii from different groups was extracted using the TRIzol Total RNA Isolation
Kit (Keygene Biotech, NanJing, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA yield and quality were verified by an average optical
density (OD) OD260/OD280 nm absorption ratio
range from 1.8 to 2.0, with a BioMate 3S UV–Visible spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Once the integrity of the total RNA
was detected to be good, the cDNA was then obtained by the PrimeScript
RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). All cDNA
samples were stored at −20 °C before further analysis
by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The reference gene was 18S
rRNA, and the specific primers used in qRT-PCR are listed in Table S7. All primers were synthesized by Sangon
Biotech (Shanghai, China). qRT-PCR was conducted on an ABI 7500 Real-time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using a Fast
Start Universal SYBR Green Master Mix (Rox) (Roche, China), and the
procedure was set as follows: initial degradation at 94 °C for
10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for
15 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final dissociation cycle for melting
curve analysis at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 95
°C for 30 s. Melting curves were generated for each reaction
to ensure specific amplification. All reactions were performed in
triplicate. We establish a standard curve and determine the PCR efficiency,
a good efficiency was verified with a slope close to −3.32
(100% theoretical efficiency). Cycle threshold (CT) values were generated from the ABI PRISM 7500 SDS Software
version 1.4 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The relative
gene expression was normalized by 18S rRNA and quantified using the
comparative CT method and the data were
analyzed as follows 1   2  

Equation 2 represents the full form of eq 1, which is used to compare the gene
expression in two different samples (sample A: treated sample and
sample B: untreated control), with the 18S rRNA gene as the internal
control.

Statistical Analysis
All data were expressed as mean ± SD (standard deviation), and
the error bars in the figures represent the standard deviation of
biological triplicates. Significant differences between two groups
were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), based on by
the Dunnett test in SPSS software. Differences were considered significant
when p < 0.05.

Results
Effects of Endophytic Fungi
on the Plant Growth of A. thaliana
A total of 277 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from ten
batches of samples (including five Anoectochilus and one Ludisia species) that were
collected from Guangxi, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Fujiang in China (Table S1), with 112 strains isolated from leaves,
91 from stems, 72 from roots, and only two from flowers (Table S2) (Figure S1). To evaluate the growth-promoting effects of these isolated endophytes, A. thaliana seedlings were cocultured with individual
fungi in VAPs. The total fresh weight and total dry weight of A. thaliana were measured after ten days of coculture
with the tested fungus. Our results revealed that many isolated fungal
strains significantly altered the growth phenotype of A. thaliana (Figure S2). Among the 277 strains, a total of 53 endophytes significantly
enhanced the total fresh weight or total dry weight of A. thaliana (Figure 1), with the ratio of the total fresh weight between
the fungus-treated group and the control group ranging from 0.89 (J72)
to 4.60 (J28) (Figure 1A) and the ratio of the total dry weight between the fungus-treated
group and the control group ranging from 1.14 (J153) to 5.87 (J28)
(Figure 1B). The changes
in the total dry weight after fungal inoculation were not completely
consistent with those of the total fresh weight. Some strains did
not show effects on the fresh weight but significantly enhanced the
dry weight (Figure 1C). Based on further detailed analyses of the quantity of identified
endophytes from different tissues, we found that most growth-promoting
fungi were isolated from the leaves of these plants (Figure 1D).

values are presented as the mean ± SD, n = 3,
*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 vs the control group. [(A) Total fresh weight;
(B) total dry weight; (C) comparison of total fresh weight and total
dry weight between different groups; and (D) percentage of growth
promoting fungi from different tissues]. (Ratio = the total fresh
weight or total dry weight of the treatment group/control).

The root length and
lateral root number of A. thaliana seedlings
were also measured on the tenth day after coculture with each of the
abovementioned 53 fungi. Our results showed that a total of 31 fungal
strains inhibited the root length of A. thaliana seedlings, with the ratio between the fungal treatment group and
the control group ranging from 0.54 (J261) to 0.99 (J69) (Figure S2A), whereas the other 22 strains increased
the root length (Figure S2B) with the ratio
between the fungal treatment group and the control group ranging from
1.04 (J9) to 1.64 (J198). Interestingly, as shown in Figures S2C and S3D, all 53 strains of growth promoting fungi
significantly enhanced the lateral root germination of Arabidopsis seedlings. A total of 19 fungal strains
notably increased the lateral root number, which was more than threefold
that of the control group (Figure S2D).
In addition, the microscopic characteristics of the Arabidopsis roots inoculated with the growth-promoting
fungi were observed at a magnification of 50× using a biological
microscope on the tenth day of cocultivation. All the strains with
growth promoting effects significantly changed the root architecture
of Arabidopsis seedlings. The microscopic
characteristics of the root hair distribution on the root meristem
of Arabidopsis seedlings are presented
in Figure S2E. The dramatic changes in
the seedlings inoculated with the growth promoting fungus (J162 and
J211) showed evidently increased lateral root numbers compared to
control seedlings. Furthermore, there was also a notable increase
in the density of root hairs observed in J162-and J211-treated seedlings
(Figure S2E), whereas the root hair of
control seedlings was sparse. Our results indicated that these growth-promoting
fungi mainly induced the differentiation of the root hair and promoted
the development of lateral root formation in Arabidopsis, thus increasing nutrient uptake and plant biomass.

Identification and Analysis of Growth-Promoting
Fungi for A. thaliana
Our
results indicated that a total of 53 strains could be cocultivated
long-term with A. thaliana, with promoted
plant growth and enhanced biomass (Figures S2 and 1).

According to our detailed phylogenetic
analysis (Table S3), except for three unknown
strains, the other 50 strains were classified into two phyla (Basidiomycota
and Ascomycota), eight orders (Polyporales, Auriculariales, Pleosporales,
Glomerellales, Hypocreales, Xylariales, Diaporthales, and Sordariales)
and 13 genera (Gliomastix, Bjerkandera, Auricularia, Helminthosporium, Colletotrichum, Acremonium, Bionectria, Fusarium, Hypoxylon, Xylariaceae, Diaporthe, Phomopsis, and Chaetomium). These fungi mainly
belong to three genera, Gliomastix, Colletotrichum, and Fusarium, which occupied 22.6, 17.0, and 13.2% of all the growth promoting
fungi, respectively.

The phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) revealed that strain J162
was most closely related to Chaetomium globosum MFLUCC with 99.06% similarity and was therefore gathered into the
same cluster. Thus, strain J162 was identified as C.
globosum. In addition, strain J211 shared 99.38% similarity
with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides IMI 356878, which suggested that endophyte J211 could be identified
as a member of the species C. gloeosporioides.

Figure 2 Phylogenetic
trees showing the relationships of strains to closer species. The
tree was based on maximum parsimony analysis of the ITS, EF-1α,
and β-tubulin gene sequences of the endophytic fungi (Only 2
of 53 growth promoting fungi were shown). Bootstrap analysis was done
with 1000 cycles. red star: Ex-type or ex-epitype. Postia caesia 12974 and Amesia nigricolor CBS 600.66 were used as outgroup sequences, respectively.

Effects of the Selected Fungi on
Plant Growth and Secondary Metabolism in A. roxburghii
We further evaluated the effects of 53 candidate fungi
on plant growth and secondary metabolism in A. roxburghii tissue culture seedlings. The biomass of A. roxburghii was determined after symbiosis with the tested fungi for 30 days.
As a result, two strains, J162 and J211, showed not only long-term
coculture with A. roxburghii without
causing disease symptoms but also significantly enhanced its biomass.
As shown in Figure 3A, both C. globosum J162 and C. gloeosporioides J211 improved the total fresh
weight and dry weight of A. roxburghii plants, with total dry weights 12.50 and 13.75% higher than that
of the control plants (Figure 3A), respectively.

Figure 3 Effects
of endophytic fungi J162 and J211 on the biomass (A) and secondary
metabolism (B) in A. roxburghii seedlings
(values are presented as means ± SD, n = 3,
*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 vs the control group).

The contents of secondary metabolites
(flavonoids, kinsenoside, and polysaccharides) in A.
roxburghii after fungal infection were also determined.
In our experiment, the accumulation of rutin in A.
roxburghii was enhanced by both J162 and J211. The
largest increase in rutin content was observed in the J211 group,
which was 26.90% higher than that of the control samples (Figure 3B). Significant increases
in the content of isoquercitrin were also observed in J211- and J162-treated
plants, which reached 54.84 and 41.88 μg/g, respectively, compared
to 35.34 μg/g in control plants (Figure 3B). These two endophytic fungi also improved
the content of narcissin in A. roxburghii, which was 29.29 and 28.49% higher than that of the control samples,
respectively. In addition, the content of quercetin reached the highest
level in J211-treated plants, which was 1.33-fold of that in the control
group. Our results showed that both J162 and J211 can be used as potential
flavonoid-stimulating fungi for A. roxburghii.

As shown in Figure 3B, only J162 significantly stimulated the accumulation of
kinsenoside in A. roxburghii with contents
21.35% higher than that in the control plants, while the content of
kinsenoside in the J211 group was comparable with that in the control
group. In addition, both J162 and J211 significantly enhanced the
polysaccharide content, which was 37.16 and 20.37% higher than that
in control plants, respectively. These data revealed that the two
selected strains had promoted effects on secondary metabolite accumulation
in A. roxburghii.

Immunocytochemical Staining of Fungal Infection
in A. roxburghii
Observation
under light microscopy showed that, after 30 days of coculture with
the selected fungi, A. roxburghii seedlings
were successfully infected with J162 and J211. As shown in Figure 4, both J162 and J211
were mainly located in the intercellular space or cell junction (red
triangle), while a minority invaded the tissue cells of A. roxburghii seedlings. Therefore, the results suggested
that these two fungi could noninvasively and stably interact with
the host mainly in the intercellular space and thus form a nonaggressive
symbiosis pattern with A. roxburghii seedlings.

Effects of the Fungi
on the Activities of Three Enzymes
After 30 days of coculture,
the activities of three enzymes, including β-1,3-glucanase,
chitinase, and superoxide dismutase, in J162- and J211-treated plants
were all significantly increased (Figure 5A). J162 strongly enhanced the activity of
β-1,3-glucanase in A. roxburghii, which was 56.67% higher than that of the control plants. In addition,
the activities of chitinase in J162- and J211-treated plants were
approximately 0.50-fold higher than that of the control group. Moreover,
the activities of superoxide dismutase were also highly increased
in J162- and J211-inoculated plants, which were 42.09 and 33.14% higher
than that in control samples, respectively. Our results showed that
these two endophytes, particularly J162, could significantly improve
the activities of favorable enzymes involved in plant growth.

The values are presented as the mean ± SD, n = 3, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
***P < 0.001 vs the control group).

Expression of Three Growth-Related Genes in A. roxburghii
Increased growth and secondary
metabolism in plants are commonly associated with the expression levels
of growth-related genes. To determine whether our fungi acted as inducers
of plant growth in A. roxburghii, 18S
rRNA gene was used as the reference gene, and the transcription levels
of three growth-related genes in A. roxburghii were determined by real-time quantitative PCR.

As shown in Figure 5B, the expression
of uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (UPRT) in A. roxburghii seedlings was strongly increased by both J162 and J211. The UPRT
gene was upregulated by J162 to the highest level at 3.20-fold that
of the control plants. In addition, the expression levels of the amino
acid transmembrane transporter (AATMT) and maturase K (matK) in A. roxburghii were significantly enhanced by J162
to 6.10- and 1.45-fold of that in the control group, respectively.
The administration of J211 also significantly increased the expression
of AATMT in plants, which was 1.50-fold that of the control plants.
However, matK was significantly downregulated by J211. These data
indicated that both J162 and J211 could promote the plant growth of A. roxburghii by affecting the expression of growth-related
genes but most likely in different ways.

Discussion
Endophytes have been reported as the promising
and sustainable microbial resources with favorable plant growth promoting
activity because they can serve their host effectively and efficiently
under a wide range of environmental conditions.17 Plant growth-promoting (PGP) endophytes may become a biological
alternative to traditional chemical fertilizers and be utilized to
increase the yields of certain valuable crops or medicinal plants.
These endophytes can be safely used as biofertilizers or disease-preventing
agents because they do not exert ecological pressures and are environmentally
friendly.18

In this study, we reported
the isolation of 277 strains of endophytic fungi from different tissues
of five Anoectochilus and one Ludisia plants collected from four provinces in China.
The isolated strains were initially screened for their growth-promoting
activity on A. thaliana seedlings.
As a result, a total of 53 strains displayed significant promoting
effects on the plant growth of A. thaliana and were identified by both morphological and molecular characterization,
except for three unknown species. Our study revealed that three genera, Gliomastix, Colletotrichum, and Fusarium, were the dominant community
members among the 53 strains of plant growth promoting fungi. Colletotrichum sp. and Fusarium sp. are common phytopathogens in many plants.19,20 In
particular, Colletotrichum sp. are
among the most important plant pathogens worldwide and are responsible
for anthracnose, an economically important disease in a wide range
of hosts, including cereals, legumes, vegetables, and tree fruits.21 However, in our study, several Colletotrichum sp. exhibited favorable effects on
the growth of A. thaliana. A recent
interesting study revealed that Colletotrichum tofieldiae, an endophytic fungus of the A. thaliana root, can transfer the macronutrient phosphorus to A. thaliana shoots, which confers plant fitness benefits
upon an intact phosphate starvation response.22 This finding indicated that Colletotrichum sp. may also exert beneficial effects on their host under environmental
stress, which merits further studies regarding the underlying actions
and mechanisms.

Our results revealed that all 53 strains of
endophytes significantly increased the number of lateral roots and
enhanced the density of root hairs because of their possible effects
on stimulating the germination of lateral roots and differentiation
of root hairs. Therefore, we deduced that these endophytes could improve
the capacity of A. thaliana seedlings
in nutrient and water uptake by increasing the surface area of the
plant root system, thus enhancing the plant biomass.

However,
the in vitro detection of PGP traits of natural endophytes does not
implicate a general and predictable improvement of the growth and
health of all types of host plants in vivo.23 Therefore, further investigations were conducted to assess whether
these PGP strains for Arabidopsis seedlings,
could produce beneficial effects on A. roxburghii plant growth and secondary metabolism. In our study, only two strains,
J162 and J211, could be long-term cocultured with A.
roxburghii tissue culture seedlings without causing
obvious disease symptoms and significantly increased the biomass of A. roxburghii. The increased plant biomass in the
fungus-treated group may be attributed to the enhanced plant nutrient
uptake of the host plant stimulated by these two fungi.24 Our findings were consistent with those of the
previous reports on the promotion of plant growth by fungal endophytes.25,26

Flavonoids in A. roxburghii were reported to be responsible for its versatile pharmacological
activities.27,28 In our experiment, the contents
of four flavonoids were also enhanced by J162 and J211 inoculation
compared with that of the control plants, which indicated that these
endophytic fungi may activate the biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids
in the whole A. roxburghii plant. Kinsenoside,
a characteristic component of Anoectochilus plants, is one of the main active ingredients and is widely distributed
in A. roxburghii, Anoectochilus
formosanus, and Anoectochilus chapaensis, which is commonly used for the treatment of diabetes, hepatitis,
liver disorders, osteoporosis, and hyperliposis.3−6 To the best
of our knowledge, there are no reports of the promoting effects of
fungal infection on the content of kinsenoside in A.
roxburghii. Our study suggested that the content of
kinsenoside in A. roxburghii seedlings
was significantly increased by J162, and J211 did not affect the accumulation
of kinsenoside. In addition, polysaccharide is also the main constituent
of A. roxburghii, possessing antioxidant,
hepatoprotective, immunostimulatory, and antitumor effects.5 Thus, we also investigated the changes in polysaccharide
content after fungal treatments. As a result, both J162 and J211 promoted
the accumulation of polysaccharides in A. roxburghii. Our data showed that these two fungi could notably activate the
secondary metabolism in the whole A. roxburghii plants, especially J162, which possesses great potential in application
and may lead to a practical breakthrough in the facilitation of A. roxburghii cultivation.

J162 and J211 were
further molecularly identified as C. globosum and C. gloeosporioides, respectively. C. globosum has been recognized as an effective biocontrol
fungus, especially in agriculture,29 which
could enhance seedling tolerance to stress.30 Recently, we obtained the endophyte D38 from Salvia
miltiorrhiza, also identified as C.
globosum, which significantly promoted the accumulation
of bioactive constituents and root production in S.
miltiorrhiza.16 Therefore,
we suggest that C. globosum may be
a universal, beneficial and crucial endophytic fungus for the quality
of many valuable crops and medicinal plants. However, Colletotrichum sp. is among the most important plant
pathogens worldwide, causing anthracnose in a wide range of hosts.21 Our study revealed that J211, identified as C. gloeosporioides, could also produce favorable
effects on A. roxburghii. This finding
coincided with an interesting report published in Cell, suggesting
that C. tofieldiae, an endophytic fungus
of Arabidopsis root, confers plant
fitness benefits upon an intact phosphate starvation response,22 which indicated that Colletotrichum sp. may also exert beneficial effects on their host under biotic
and abiotic stresses.

Pathogens, as well as endophytic fungi,
have evolved different strategies to overcome various barriers that
they encounter during the infection of their hosts.31 A previous study reported that the fungal hyphae could
directly enter root epidermal cells and produce intracellular hyphae,
and the fungus establishes a biotrophic interaction with the living
host cells and invades roots via junctions between epidermal cells
to form intercellular hyphae. Furthermore, the fungi could enter the
aboveground parts of the plant via the central cylinder.22,32 Our results showed that both the candidate fungi J162 and J211 mainly
colonized the intercellular gap of the xylem parenchyma cells of A. roxburghii roots during long-term cocultivation,
which suggested that these fungi may penetrate into tissue cells through
the intercellular space and form a nonaggressive symbiosis pattern
with the host. However, more precise investigations at the ultrastructural
level are urgently needed in future studies.

Previous studies
showed that stress-related enzymes, such as peroxidases, polyphenoloxides,
and SOD, were induced and increased when the plants were subjected
to pathogenic attack.33,34 Furthermore, chitinase and glucanase
are also important enzymes for the catalytic hydrolysis of pathogenic
fungus cell walls, which contribute to increasing the disease resistance
of the host plant.35,36 Therefore, we hypothesized that
beneficial fungi may induce stress-related enzymes to resist disadvantages
and thus improve plant growth. In our study, the activities of β-1,3-glucanase,
chitinase, and SOD were significantly increased in plants treated
with the tested fungi J162 and J211, which indicated that these two
strains enhanced the activities of stress-related enzymes to protect
the plantlets and thus influence the growth of A. roxburghii.

Additionally, to explore the possible mechanism of the endophytic
effects of J162 and J211 on plant growth and metabolism, the expression
of three growth-related genes in A. roxburghii was further investigated. A previous study found that three clones
were differentially expressed in A. roxburghii during symbiosis with a growth-promoting mycorrhizal fungus Epulorhiza sp., including two genes encoding UPRT
and AATMT, respectively, and a matK pseudogene expressed only in seedlings
after fungal treatment.37 UPRT is involved
in salvaging pyrimidines by catalyzing the formation of uridine monophosphate
from uracil and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate.38 Uracil salvage is of major importance for plant development,39 which, in our study, was markedly upregulated
by J162 and J211 inoculation, and the expression of AATMT was also
increased by both fungal treatments. Amino acids are known to play
fundamental roles in multiple processes in plants, including hormone
metabolism, cell growth, production of metabolic energy, nitrogen
metabolism, and urea biosynthesis.40 Furthermore,
matK was significantly increased in J162-inoculated plants but notably
downregulated in J211-treated plants, thus indicating different mechanisms
in the plant growth regulation of these two fungi. These data suggested
that the endophytes J162 and J211 may regulate the gene expression
of UPRT, AATMT, and matK to facilitate nutrient uptake, transportation,
and utilization, thus promoting the plant growth and secondary metabolism
of A. roxburghii. However, it is still
unknown how fungi stimulate these genes through signal transduction,
which requires further study to understand the detailed mechanism
of action.

In conclusion, we isolated a collection of 277 strains
of endophytic fungi from five Anoectochilus and one Ludisia species, among which C. globosum J162 and C. gloeosporioides J211 significantly promoted the growth and secondary metabolism
of A. roxburghii. Our results suggest
that endophytic fungi from the Anoectochilus and Ludisia species are highly beneficial
microbial resources, especially J162 and J211, which can be utilized
to improve the yield and quality of Chinese folk medicine “Jinxianlian”
in agricultural cultivation.
