Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs)
are model membrane systems consisting
of a single lipid bilayer separating an inner lumen from the outer
solution, with dimensions comparable to that of eukaryotic cells.
The importance of these biomimetic systems has recently grown with
the development of easy and safe methods to assemble GUVs from complex
biorelevant compositions. However, size and position control is still
a key challenge for GUV formation and manipulation. Here, a gel-assisted
formation method is introduced, able to produce arrays of giant unilamellar
anchored vesicles (GUAVs) with a predetermined narrow size distribution.
The approach based on micropatterned gel substrates of cross-linked
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) allows performing parallel
measurements on thousands of immobile unilamellar vesicles. Such power
and flexibility will respond to the growing need for developing platforms
of biomimetic constructs from cell-sized single bilayers.

1 Introduction
Model
lipid membranes are essential tools for unraveling the mechanisms
that drive complex biological processes at the level of cell membranes.1,2 In the family of available model lipid platforms, giant unilamellar
vesicles (GUVs) strike as a prominent member.3 These cell-sized vesicles are composed of a single bilayer that
separates an enclosed volume from the outer solution. Giant vesicles
were first used to study the intrinsic physical and chemical properties
of membranes: permeability, lipid mobility, mechanical behavior, and
phase transformations.4,5 Today, they are employed not only
in biophysics and biology but also in physical chemistry in quests
for understanding the origin of life and in several application-driven
fields such as microreactor synthesis or drug delivery.6−8

The first methods available for the formation of GUVs were
often
limited to a restricted variety of lipids. Over the past decade, many
new strategies were developed for self-assembling giant vesicles from
increasingly complex compositions of lipids and other (bio)macromolecules.8 The concomitant development of new methods for
their observation and micromanipulation has now brought giant vesicles
to the central stage of studies related to lipid bilayers. Here, the
widening community of users calls for accuracy and predictability
in the size distribution, for simplification of the methods for position
control and for progress in the statistical power of the analysis
performed on individual GUVs.

In this paper, we address these
challenges by combining the advantages
of gel-assisted methods for GUV formation with the precision and flexibility
offered by gel micropatterning. Although photolithography and microcontact
printing techniques have been previously used to attempt size control
of GUVs, these attempts lacked the advantages of gel-growing methods
and did not achieve good vesicle unilamellarity by gentle hydration
or required electrical fields to induce unilamellar vesicle formation.9−15 Photolithographic masks on an agarose gel circumvented some of these
difficulties but controlled only the spatial distribution of spread
lipids, leading to vesicle size polydispersity above 30%.16 Recently, giant lipid vesicles were prepared
also on PDMS17 and Si18 microwell arrays. As we will show here by appropriate patterning
and cross-linking of the gel films, one can generate arrays of thousands
of monodisperse giant unilamellar vesicles anchored on the substrate.
We coin this new platform as giant unilamellar anchored vesicles (GUAVs)
and demonstrate its advantages by performing fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy (FCS) experiments on the immobilized vesicles and parallel
measurements of membrane area changes induced by oxidative stress.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of Micropatterned
Hydrogel Layers
Our strategy for preparation of micropatterned,
anchored hydrogel
layers is schematically shown in Figure 1. As a hydrogel-forming material, we used
a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-based statistical terpolymer
(PNIPAAm). Its backbone included 94% of NIPAAm units as a main component,
approximately 5% of ionizable methacrylic acid units for increased
solubility in water, and 1% hydrophobic benzophenone-based cross-linker
(see the Supporting Information for the
reaction).

Figure 1 Preparation of micropatterned PNIPAAm hydrogels. (a) A PNIPAAm
terpolymer film is spin-coated on a functionalized glass substrate
and illuminated with a weak dose (0.28 J/cm2) of collimated
UV light (365 nm) to obtain an anchored, cross-linked polymer network.
(b) Further UV illumination (3.92 J/cm2) through a photolithography
mask and (c) subsequent rinsing with ethanol leads to the formation
of a PNIPAAm film with a defined pattern of shallow, weakly cross-linked
areas. (d) Submersion in aqueous solutions creates a PNIPAAm hydrogel
in which the weakly cross-linked areas swell more than the rest of
the film and form a pillar pattern. (e) White-light confocal profilometry

microscopy image (xz view) of the patterned PNIPAAm
hydrogel, swollen in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing a
small amount of rhodamine 6G that adsorbs to the gel (see text for
details).

The procedures for the synthesis
of the PNIPAAm terpolymer and
its processing into thin anchored hydrogel layers are well established
in our laboratory and described in detail in the Methods.19−22 Briefly, a thin PNIPAAm film (1.1 ± 0.1 μm in the dry
state) was spin-coated from an ethanol solution on glass substrates
prefunctionalized with benzophenone silane. The film was illuminated
with collimated UV light (Figure 1b) that lead to activation of the benzophenone groups
on both the polymer chains and the glass surface and therefore to
simultaneous cross-linking and anchoring of the PNIPAAm network.20,23 By tuning the exposure dose of the UV light, one can control the
degree of cross-linking and thus the swelling ratio RS of the PNIPAAm hydrogel films (see Figure S1 and Table S1 for details). To prepare micropatterned
hydrogels, an initial homogeneous UV illumination of the PNIPAAm film
at a low-energy dose (Figure 1a) that ensured anchoring and low-density cross-linking of
the entire film was followed by further UV illumination through a
photolithography mask (Figure 1b). The mask covered a square pattern of circles on the PNIPAAm
film and protected them from further illumination and cross-linking.
The noncovered parts were illuminated further, leading to the formation
of a strongly cross-linked background area on the film. After the
illumination, the PNIPAAm film was rinsed with ethanol, thus removing
the non-cross-linked and non-anchored polymer chains. This resulted
in the formation of a dry polymer film with shallow circular holes
with defined diameters ordered in a precise square pattern (Figure 1c). The polymer network
in these holes is less cross-linked than its surroundings, and upon
swelling with water, it swells more creating a pattern of strongly
swollen hydrogel pillars on a less swollen background (Figure 1d). A typical white-light confocal
profilometry image of a dry patterned PNIPAAm film after rinsing with
ethanol is shown in Figure 1e. The square pattern of round holes with a depth of 0.3 μm
is clearly visible. In these weakly illumined regions, more polymer
chains were not cross-linked and rinsed off by the ethanol. The rest
of the film itself has a thickness of 1 μm. Below the holes,
a 0.7 μm thick layer of polymer remains. Figure 1f shows a confocal laser scanning microscopy
(CLSM) image (xz view) of the same patterned PNIPAAm
film after swelling in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). To enable
CLSM imaging, a small amount of fluorescent rhodamine 6G molecules
that preferably adsorb to the PNIPAAm due to hydrophobic interactions22 was added to PBS. The image reveals a pattern
of strongly swollen (RS ≈ 30) hydrogel
pillars on top of the less swollen (RS ≈ 10) background.

2.2 Formation of Monodisperse
Giant Unilamellar
Anchored Vesicles
GUAVs were prepared by hydration of a dry
layer of lipids spread on the surface of a dry patterned PNIPPAm film
(Figure 2). As a model
membrane system, we used 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine
(DOPS) in a 4:1 ratio. A small amount (0.5%) of Atto488-labeled 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (Atto488-DOPE) was added
to enable confocal microscopy imaging. First, a lipid layer was deposited
on top of a dry patterned PNIPAAm film by drop casting 30 μL
of chloroform solution (1 g/L). The lipid solution spread over the
entire surface of the patterned PNIPAAm film and the chloroform evaporated
within minutes under ambient conditions. Afterward, the microscope-coverslip
glass substrate supporting the PNIPAAm film was mounted on an Attofluor
Cell Chamber (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the lipid layer facing
upward, and 600 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was slowly
added to the chamber. Within 5 min, the background gel swelled to
a thickness of approximately 10 μm (that corresponds to RS ≈ 10) and the pillars to 20 μm
(RS ≈ 30), and numerous giant vesicles
formed. The experiments were performed at room temperature, 23 °C.

sizes on a homogenous hydrogel film and (b) with a defined size on
the pillars of a micropatterned hydrogel film. A dry layer of lipids
spread on the surface of a dry PNIPAAm gel is hydrated from water
coming from below (blue arrows) and swelling the gel. (c) 2D CLSM
image of an array of uniform GUAVs, prepared on a micropatterned PNIPAAm
hydrogel. (d) 3D CLSM image of an array of 16 GUAVs zoomed in to a
single pillar with one GUAV on top.

Vesicle formation speed and mechanisms are comparable to
that observed
on PVA gels or agarose substrates.24,25 However, in
contrast to these early works that used homogeneous substrates and
thus the GUVs form randomly and have a very broad size distribution
(Figure 2a), on the
micropatterned PNIPAAm film, giant vesicles can form only on the weakly
cross-linked and strongly swollen pillars (Figure 2b). Furthermore, the giant vesicles have
a well-defined size determined by the pillars’ diameter (Figure 2d). On the strongly
cross-linked parts of the film, vesicle formation is inhibited (see Figure S2 and the Supporting Information for
details), and only very small vesicles grew in these areas. The 3D
CLSM images in Figure 2d reveal that the lipids not only form vesicles on the top of the
PNIPAAm hydrogel pillars but also partially penetrate into the polymer
network. Thus, the unilamellar vesicles are immobilized on controlled
positions, according to a predefined pattern that is a promising alternative
to other immobilization methods.26,27 We name this
new type of lipid vesicle system Giant Unilamellar Anchored Vesicles
(GUAVs). Thousands of such uniformly sized GUAVs ordered in a predefined
pattern (Figure 2c)
can be prepared in a few minutes. Similar to the vesicles formed on
PVA gels or agarose substrates,24,25 the anchored vesicles
prepared on the micropatterned PNIPAM hydrogels are unilamellar as
indicated by the similar fluorescence brightness that they show on
the CLSM images. The fact that in Figure 2c some smaller vesicles appear brighter than
the rest is caused by the limited resolution of the shown image as
demonstrated in Figure S3.

Furthermore,
the size of the GUAVs can be easily controlled by
tuning the diameter of micropatterned PNIPAAm pillars. This is demonstrated
in Figure 3 that shows
CLSM images of GUAVs formed on PNIPAAm films patterned with three
different photolithography masks. The diameters of the nontransparent
circles were 15, 30, and 50 μm. With diameters of 15.8 ±
3.1, 30.9 ± 2.4, and 46.1 ± 2.8 μm, the generated
GUAVs closely match the sizes defined by the photolithography masks.
Note that such a close correspondence of sizes cannot be determined
only by the amount of lipids available on the pillar before swelling
since there is a factor of four between the surface of a sphere and
the surface of its two-dimensional projection; formation of a vesicle
from a bilayer patch of radius R should result in
a vesicle of radius R/2. For the
GUAV technique, it is likely that the anchoring conditions of the
bilayer on the pillar, as seen in Figures 2d and 3b, also play
an important role in controlling the vesicle size.

Figure 3 Controlling the vesicle
size. GUAVs prepared by PNIPAAm gel-assisted
swelling for three different mask/pattern sizes. (a) CLSM images (xy plane) of GUAVs, labeled with Atto488. (b) CLSM images
(xz plane) of GUAVs. (c) Size distribution of the
GUAV diameters. The histograms were obtained by measuring the diameters
of roughly 90 GUAVs for each pattern. The lines represent a normal
distribution fit that yielded the values of the average GUAV diameter
and the respective standard deviation.

The strategy developed in this paper relies on the differential
swelling ratios between gel regions of high and low cross-linking
densities. After swelling, the highly swollen regions of the gel appeared
as pillars decorated with a giant vesicle. The hard regions surrounding
the pillars did not lead to giant vesicle growth. Thus, the parameters
of the pattern of the optical mask controlling the geometry of the
high and low cross-linked regions translated directly into giant vesicle
size and positioning. The method will allow preparing not only giant
vesicles with monodisperse size but also more complex but well-defined
mixtures of vesicles with different sizes anchored on predetermined
positions. In particular, it could be useful to prepare arrays of
GUAVs with sizes gradually changing, for example, between 50 μm
and 5 μm, and study the effect of vesicle size in a single microscopy
experiment.

Such an approach takes advantage of the anchoring
of GUVs after
the swelling of the hydrogel film. While the detailed nature of this
anchoring is not completely clear yet, most likely, it originates
from hydrophobic attraction between the lipids and the hydrogel films.
As discussed above, as the hydrogel-forming material, we used a statistical
terpolymer (PNIPAAm) which backbone contains also 1% of hydrophobic
benzophenone-based cross-linker units. In previous studies, we have
found that the presence of these units leads to hydrophobic attraction
between similar PNIPAAm hydrogels and partially hydrophobic molecules
such as immunoglobulin28 or rhodamine 6G.22 The existence of such attraction is also indicated
by the fact that a large number of lipids are partitioned inside the
swollen hydrogels as shown in Figure 3b. Furthermore, electrostatic interactions can also
be present and eventually lead to systematic differences in the partitioning
behavior of charged and uncharged lipids.

2.3 Lipid
Mobility in the Bilayer Membrane of
GUAVs
To demonstrate the advantages of anchored giant vesicles
with respect to position control, we investigated the mobility of
lipids by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS).29,30 Due to its high selectivity, sensitivity (down to a single-molecule
level), and extremely small probing volume (<1 μm3) that can be precisely positioned on the lipid membrane, FCS is
uniquely suited for such studies.29,30 Here, we study
the lateral diffusion of Atto633-DOPE (Atto633-1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) lipids in the membrane
of the GUAVs (Figure 4). Therefore, 0.01% of Atto633-DOPE was added to the standard lipid
mixture used for the preparation of GUAVs. The GUAVs were first imaged
with CLSM at 488 nm, the excitation wavelength of Atto488-DOPE lipids
present in the membrane at the 0.5% fraction. Next, the confocal volume
was positioned precisely at the lipid membrane on the “north
pole” of a GUAV (Figure 4a), and FCS measurements were performed with the Atto633-DOPE
lipids using an excitation wavelength of 633 nm. Due to the anchoring
of the GUAVs, the lipid membrane position was stable with respect
to the confocal volume, and thus FCS experiments could be performed
over many minutes.

Figure 4 Lipid diffusion in the bilayer membrane of a GUAV measured
by fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy. (a) Schematic of the experiment. The fluorescence
(green) of the Atto488-DOPE lipids present in the GUAV membrane at
a 0.5% fraction is used to image the vesicles and position the confocal
volume precisely at the lipid membrane. Next, excitation at 633 nm
is used to excite the Atto633-DOPE lipids that are present at a low
(0.01%) fraction suitable for FCS experiments. The temporal fluctuations
of the detected fluorescence intensity I(t) caused
by the lateral diffusion of the Atto633-DOPE lipids (red) through
the confocal volume are recorded and processed to an autocorrelation
curve. (b) Normalized autocorrelation curve G(τ)
measured for Atto633-labeled DOPE lipids diffusing in the bilayer
membrane (red circles) and the corresponding fit (red solid lines)
with a 2D diffusion model function. The autocorrelation curve measured
for the reference dye used for calibration of the confocal volume,
Atto633, freely diffusing in water (black squares) and the corresponding
fit (black solid lines) with a 3D diffusion model function are also
shown for comparison.

A typical FCS autocorrelation curve measured in this way
is shown
in Figure 4b together
with the corresponding fit with an analytical function based on a
single-component two-dimensional diffusion model.29,30 The fit yielded a value of D = (1.01 ± 0.14)
× 10–11 m2/s for the diffusion coefficient
of Atto633-DOPE lipids. This value is in good agreement with the results
of earlier FCS studies of labeled lipid diffusion in lipid GUVs.31−33

2.4 Photo-Oxidation of the GUAV Membrane
The
GUAV platform allows following simultaneously the physicochemical
transformation of lipid bilayers on many vesicles. As an example,
we studied lipid photosensitization.34−36 Photosensitizer erythrosine
(50 μM) was added to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and irradiated
at 547 nm to create singlet oxygen that oxidizes the lipid bilayers.34,35 Under such conditions, membrane area changes are expected following
the formation of hydroperoxides, the primary product of photosensitization.37−39 Therefore, we monitored the area increase of the GUAVs equator as
a function of the irradiation dose. For these particular experiments,
an array of 9 × 9 GUAVs was chosen (Figure 5), but much larger numbers of vesicles can
be monitored depending on the target resolution. As the images show,
the fate of each individual vesicle in the array can be easily monitored,
and measurements such as the changes in the relative area of the equatorial
plane (Figure 5e) can
be straightforwardly performed by image analysis.

on GUAVs. Confocal laser scanning images
of the equator of GUAVs after illumination with different irradiation
doses. (a) Before irradiation the GUAVs are uniform and completely
round-shaped. With irradiating the photo-oxidizer erythrosine, the
GUAVs become larger, deform, and move from their positions. (b–d)
The effect increases with increasing dose. Scale bars are 50 μm.
(e) Area increase of the GUAV equator as a function of energy dose.

Variations in values of the area
increase are intrinsic to this
process and also seen in GUVs, as for instance reported in ref (38), although they are likely
amplified here by heterogeneities in the anchoring conditions between
the membrane and the gel.

3 Conclusions
We have shown here that the ability to spatially modulate the crosslinking
density of a thin gel brings unprecedented size control in the gel-assisted
formation of single-bilayer vesicles. By patterning the cross-linking
density in thin gels of PNIPAAm, we have obtained essentially monodisperse
giant anchored vesicles with a variation in diameters smaller than
10%.

The strategy developed in this paper relied on the differential
swelling ratios between gel regions of high and low cross-linking
densities. After swelling, the highly swollen regions of the gel appeared
as pillars decorated with a giant vesicle, the hard regions surrounding
the pillars did not lead to giant vesicle growth. This happened because
the vesicle formation process is strongly dependent on the degree
of cross-linking and the swelling ratio even for unstructured PNIPAAm
gels (see Figure S2 and the Supporting
Information for details). While a large number of vesicles with various
sizes form on such gels, there is a general tendency that the average
size and the fraction of large vesicles are decreasing gradually with
the increase of cross-linking density (Figure S2). Thus, the parameters of the pattern of the optical mask
controlling the geometry of the high and low cross-linked regions
translated directly into giant vesicle size and positioning. The transferability
from pattern design to giant vesicle properties is an intrinsic flexible
powerful feature of the method, as it will allow preparing not only
giant vesicles of a targeted size but also more complex but well-defined
mixtures of different sizes with predetermined positions.

Indeed,
contrary to gel-assisted growth with other polymer gels,
the giant vesicles here remained attached to the substrate and positioned
on the pillars. As a result, thousands of anchored, precisely positioned
giant vesicles are formed upon simple addition of the solution to
the dry patterned gel where lipid was spread. The anchoring is due
to the lipid penetration into the dry and swollen gel, which changes
the capillary boundary conditions between the bilayers and the substrate.
Although the detailed structure of the anchoring region is likely
to determine how well the interior of the GUVs is sealed with respect
to different molecules, it does not compromise the purity of the formed
GUAVs since the gel is chemically cross-linked. It is important to
underline that the stability of this giant vesicle platform is insured
also by the chemical cross-linking of the gel film to the substrate,
resulting in a very robust formation and observation platform for
GUAVs.

Physical measurements performed on GUAVs revealed also
the possibilities
offered by this platform with respect to position control and parallel
measurements under a microscope. FCS measurements could be performed
under very stable conditions for several minutes, providing lipid
diffusion coefficients in agreement with values from the literature.
Photosensitization of the vesicles was also easily achieved, and the
resulting transformations could simultaneously be followed and qualitatively
evaluated on many vesicles. Excitingly, these achievements are a key
step toward the development in a near future of automated measurements
under an optical microscope on massive arrays of biomimetic lipid
membranes.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 4-Methacryloyloxybenzophenone
(MABP)
Ten grams (50 mmol) of 4-hydroxybenzophenone was dissolved
in 100
mL of dichloromethane (DCM), the mixture was cooled in an ice bath,
and a solution of 5.1 mL (53 mmol) of methacryloyl chloride and 7.7
mL (56 mmol) of triethylamine in 20 mL of dry DCM was added dropwise.
The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. The solvent
was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in diethyl ether. The
nonsoluble triethylammonium salt was removed by filtration. The organic
phase was washed with water three times and afterward dried over Na2SO4. The solvent was evaporated, and the crude
product was chromatographed over DCM/hexane (7:3). The product was
recrystallized from a mixture of DCM and hexane (2:8).

4.2 Functionalization of the Glass Substrates
Round microscope
cover slides (diameter: 25 mm, thickness: 150
μm) were used as substrates for the polymer films. The glass
slides were cleaned with 2% Hellmanex solution (Hellmanex II, Hellma
GmbH, Müllheim), ultrapure water (Milli-Q water, 18.2 MΩ
cm), and twice with ethanol (each time with 15 min sonication in the
corresponding solvent/solution). Afterward, the glass slides were
stored for at least 24 h in 6% benzophenone triethoxysilane ethanol
solution under argon in the dark. Then, the slides were washed with
ethanol and dried under vacuum for 1 h at 50 °C.

4.3 Poly(N-Isopropylacrylamide)-Based
Terpolymer
Ten grams (88 mmol) of N-isopropylacrylamide
(NIPAAm) (recrystallized from toluene/hexane, 1:1), 380 mg (0.37 mL,
4.4 mmol) methacrylic acid (MAA) (distillated before use), and 235
mg (0.88 mmol) 4-methacryloyloxybenzophenone (MABP) were dissolved
in 68 mL dioxane. Argon was flown through the solution for 1 h. Sixty-seven
milligrams (0.41 mmol) of azobisiosbutyronitrile (AIBN) was added
to the solution, and the reaction was stirred at 60 °C under
argon for 48 h. For purification, the reaction solvent was evaporated,
and the product precipitated from methanol in ice cold diethyl ether.
The molecular weight was Mw = 220 kg/mol,
and the polydispersity index was PDI = 1.55, as obtained from gel
permeation chromatography. See Scheme S1 for the synthetic route.

4.4 Polymer Template
Polymer films were
prepared from 10 wt % PNIPAAm terpolymer solution in ethanol. The
solution was spin-coated at room temperature onto the prefunctionalized
round microscope glass substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 s. After spin-coating,
the samples were solvent-vapor-annealed for 1 h in ethanol vapor and
afterward temperature-annealed for 1 h at 170 °C in vacuum. Then,
the samples were dried for 24 h at 50 °C under vacuum. The polymer
was cross-linked and anchored to the glass substrate by irradiation
with UV light (365 nm) using an LED (LCS-0365-07-22 High-Power LED
Collimator Source, 365 nm, 7 W, 22 mm aperture, type B). For micropatterning,
different photolithography masks with appropriate structure were positioned
onto the samples.

The total irradiation energy dose for cross-linking
was 4.2 J/cm2, 0.28 J/cm2 before and 3.92 J/cm2 after adding the photolithography mask. These values are
estimated based on a calibration experiment in which the intensity
of UV light versus the LED current was measured without any photolithography
mask between the LED and optical power meter. Thus, the real energy
dose reaching the patterned PNIPAAm films can be lower. Subsequently,
the samples were rinsed with pure ethanol and dried at 50 °C
for 1 h under vacuum.

4.5 Giant Unilamellar Anchored
Vesicle (GUAV)
Formation
Phospholipids were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
as powder. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine
DOPS were dissolved in chloroform (c = 1 g/L). As
a fluorescent marker, Atto488-labeled 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (Atto488-DOPE) was used and dissolved
in dichloromethane and methanol (8:2) (c = 1 g/L).

Lipid solutions were stored at −20 °C before use. The
final lipid solution for GUAV formation was prepared from the DOPC
solution with 20% DOPS and 0.5% Atto488-DOPE. The lipid solution (30
μL) was added to the polymer sample. After evaporation of chloroform,
600 μL PBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4) was used to grow
GUAVs.

4.6 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy
Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) experiments were performed
with a commercial setup (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), consisting of
an inverted microscope model Axiovert 200, the module LSM510, and
a Zeiss C-Apochromat 40×/1.2 W water immersion objective. The
Atto488-labeled lipids were excited with an argon ion laser with a
wavelength of 488 nm. The samples were measured in Attofluor cell
chambers at room temperature.

4.7 Determination
of the Lipid Diffusion Coefficient
via Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy
To the mixture
of phospholipids for the GUAV formation, 0.01% Atto633-labeled DOPE
was added, and the GUAVs were prepared as described above. FCS experiments
were performed on an LSM 880 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) setup. Excitation
laser light was focused on the samples using a Zeiss C-Apochromat
40×/1.2 W water immersion objective. The emission was collected
with the same objective and, after passing through a confocal pinhole,
directed to a spectral detection unit (Quasar, Carl Zeiss). In this,
unit emission is spectrally separated by a grating element on a 32-channel
array of GaAsP detectors operating in a single-photon counting mode.

An argon laser (λ = 488 nm) was used to excite the fluorescence
of the Atto488-DOPE lipids present in the GUAVs membrane at the 0.5%
fraction and thus image the vesicles and position the confocal volume
precisely at the lipid membrane. Next, a HeNe laser (λ = 633
nm) was used for excitation of Atto633-labeled lipids, and emission
in the range from 650 to 696 nm was detected with a QUASAR detection
unit. An Attofluor metal chamber was used as a sample cell. For each
sample, 10 measurements (30 s each) were performed. Obtained experimental
autocorrelation curves were fitted with a theoretical model function
for a 2D diffusion, yielding the diffusion coefficient of the Atto633-labeled
lipids in the bilayer. Calibration of the size of the confocal volume
was done by recording autocorrelation curves for a reference dye with
a known diffusion coefficient, that is, Atto633 freely diffusing in
water.

4.8 Photo-Oxidation
Erythrosine was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich as a powder and was diluted in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to a concentration of 50 μM. For imaging,
we used an LSM 880 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Jena, Germany) equipped with a Zeiss C-Apochromat 40×/1.2 W water
immersion objective. Atto488-labeled DOPE lipids were excited by an
argon ion laser with a wavelength of 488 nm, and their emission in
the range from 500 to 550 nm was detected with the QUASAR detection
unit. For irradiation of the photo-oxidizer erythrosine, we used the
microscope-attached mercury lamp (HXP 120 C, FSet43wf). Image analysis
was performed with the software ImageJ.
