In
this study, we developed a doping technology capable of improving
the electrochemical performance, including the rate capability and
cycling stability, of P2-type Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.
Our approach involved using titanium as a doping element to partly
substitute either Fe or Mn in Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2. The Ti-substituted Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 shows superior electrochemical
properties compared to the pristine sample. We investigated the changes
in the crystal structure, surface chemistry, and particle morphology
caused by Ti doping and correlated these changes to the improved performance.
The enhanced rate capability and cycling stability were attributed
to the enlargement of the NaO2 slab in the crystal structure
because of Ti doping. This promoted Na-ion diffusion and prevented
the phase transition from the P2 to the OP4/″Z″ structure.

1 Introduction
Sodium-ion
batteries (SIBs) have been drawing much attention as
candidates to replace lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) because sodium
is a much more abundant and affordable alkali metal than lithium.1−4 Lately, various cathode materials for SIBs have been developed.
In particular, layer-structured materials such as NaxCoO2 and NaxMnO2 have been attracting considerable attention.5−15 NaMeO compounds with a layered structure can be classified as being
either of the prismatic (P2) or octahedral (O3) type.16,17 In these materials, the sodium ions are intercalated between the
MeO2 slabs. O3-type materials including NaFe1/2Co1/2O2,18 NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2,19 and NaFe1/2Mn1/2O217 have lower reversible discharge
capacities than P2-type materials because of their complicated phase
transition and alignment of sodium ions. Thus, P2-type materials such
as Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3–xTixO2,20 Na2/3Co2/3Mn1/3O2,21 Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2,22,23 and Na2/3Ni1/3Ti2/3O224 have been extensively investigated. Although P2-type NaxFeO2 has been considered a promising
cathode material based on previous experimental evidence and cost,
this material is extremely difficult to synthesize because of the
instability of the Fe4+ ions in the oxide-ion framework
in air. Therefore, in an attempt to stabilize the P2 phase, Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 was synthesized
by partly substituting Fe with Mn.17

P2-type Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 (NFMO)17,25,26 is one of
the most promising cathode materials for SIBs. All of
the constituent elements (Na, Fe, and Mn) are abundantly available,
and NFMO has a high energy density of 520 W h/kg and high capacity
of 190 mA h g–1, which enhances the attractiveness
of this material as a cathode material for SIBs. However, the complicated
intercalation and de-intercalation processes of sodium ions deteriorate
the electrochemical properties including the rate capability and cycling
stability of NFMO.12,13,15,17 It has been reported that similar problems
presented by the active materials for LIBs could be overcome by doping
the crystal structure with inert alien elements.27−32 Some of these elements could improve the electrochemical properties
by stabilizing the phase transition and raising the electronic conductivity
without participating in the electrochemical reaction. Fortunately,
the doping technology has also been reported to be effective for producing
cathode materials for SIBs.33−40 On the basis of these studies, we aimed to solve the problems associated
with NFMO in terms of its rate capability and cycling stability by
partly substituting Fe with Ti or Mn in NFMO. We expected that the
higher bonding energy of Ti–O (ΔHf298K(Ti–O)
= 662 kJ/mol) than those of Fe–O (ΔHf298K(Fe–O)
= 409 kJ/mol) and Mn–O (ΔHf298K(Mn–O)
= 402 kJ/mol) would be able to stabilize the crystal structure of
NFMO when it is doped with Ti.41

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Physical Properties
All samples have
a P2-type structure with a P63/mmc symmetry, as confirmed by powder X-ray Rietveld refinement.
The final refinement profiles are shown in Figure 1a–e for NFMO, Mn–Ti05, Mn–Ti10,
Fe–Ti05, and Fe–Ti10, respectively, and the lattice
parameters are summarized in Table 1. Although each sample contains a small quantity of
unidentified impurities, they do not affect the refinement because
the observed peaks for the impurity phase are relatively weak. The
lattice parameters of each sample are compared in Figure 1f. The refined atomic parameters
are summarized in Tables S1–S5 in the Supporting Information.

The increase in the titanium content causes the a parameter to increase, whereas the c parameter
decreases, which seems to be due to the smaller ionic size of Ti4+ (0.605 Å) than Fe3+ (0.645 Å) or Mn3+ (0.645 Å). In the P2-type structure, the sodium ions
are situated in trigonal prismatic sites located between the transition
metal oxide (MO2) sheets of the layered structure. There
are two sodium sites, Na1 and Na2, which share faces or edges with
the MO6 octahedra. As shown in Tables S1–S5, in terms of occupancy, the Na2 site is preferred
to the Na1 site for all samples. This observation, which is consistent
with that of previous structural studies on a similar compound, P2-Na2/3Co2/3Mn1/3O2,11 is attributed to the Na1 site being less favorable
owing to the face-sharing characteristics of Na1 compared to the edge-sharing
Na2 site; thus, a stronger repulsion exists between Na1 and the transition
metal ion.

The effect of substituting Ti for Fe or Mn was examined
by calculating
the thicknesses of the MO2 slab and the Na layer of each
sample by employing Rietveld analysis. The results are summarized
in Figure 2 and Table 2. Substitution by
Ti4+ decreases the MO2 slab thickness but increases
the thickness of the Na layer. The decrease in the MO2 slab
is attributed to the greater bonding energy of Ti–O than that
of Fe–O or Mn–O. The enlarged Na slab thickness is beneficial
for Na-ion diffusion in the crystal structure during the charging
and discharging processes. However, the Na slab thickness of the sample
decreased with increasing Ti substitution amount from 5 to 10%, contrary
to the expectation that increasing Ti substitution would lead to the
increase in the Na slab thickness. The reason may be the change in
the valence state and ionic radius of Fe and Mn ions caused by Ti
substitution. Ti substitution to Fe or Mn would lower the valence
state of Fe or Mn and thus increase the ionic radius of Fe or Mn,
which would enlarge the MO2 slab thickness and decrease
the Na slab size. The atomic compositions of the samples were measured
by plasma–optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES), and
the results are listed in Table 3. The measurements were almost identical to the estimated
value by the amount of the precursor reagents.

shows the particle size and morphology of the samples. The particles
have irregular sizes and platelet shapes. We can see that Ti substitution
does not cause any significant change in the particle size and shape.

2.2 Electrochemical
Properties
The samples
were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate
the change in the oxidation state of the transition metal elements
in NFMO and Fe- or Mn-doped samples (Figure 4). The spectrum for Fe 2p3/2 (Figure 4a) is composed of
Fe2+ and Fe3+ of which the binding energies
are observed at 708.9 and 710.4 eV, respectively.38,43,44 In NFMO, Mn–Ti10, and Fe–Ti10,
the ratio between Fe2+ and Fe3+ is almost identical.
The spectrum for Mn 2p3/2 (Figure 4b) contains Mn3+ and Mn4+ of which the binding energies are observed at 641.2 and 644.1 eV,
respectively.36−38,40,45,46 When we compare the spectrum
for Mn 2p3/2 of NFMO, Mn–Ti10, and Fe–Ti10,
the peak intensity of Mn3+ was found to increase with Ti
substitution and reached a maximum for Fe–Ti10.

Figure 4 XPS spectra of the transition
metal element in powder samples:
(a) Fe, (b) Mn, and (c) Ti.

The XPS spectrum of Ti 2p3/2 (Figure 4c) shows the existence of Ti4+, the binding energy of which is observed at 457.0 eV.47,48 However, Ti4+ is electrochemically inert in the potential
range of 1.5–4.2 V versus Na+/Na, and it does not
contribute to the capacity during cycling. The XPS result shows that
the presence of Ti4+ has a greater effect on the valence
state of Mn than on that of Fe, and this is closely related to the
discharge capacity of the samples.

Figure 5 represents
the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve measured at 0.1 mV s–1 from 1.5 to 4.2 V for the electrodes. All electrodes exhibited two
identical redox pairs: one at low potential for Mn3+/4+ and the other at high potential for Fe3+/4+.17,26,38 As mentioned above, Ti4+ does not participate in the redox reaction over the potential range
considered in this analysis.20,39 The potential gap between
the peaks of a redox reaction implies the reversibility of the electrochemical
reaction.49 The reversibility is closely
related with the structural stability of the layered cathode materials.50 The potential gap corresponding to the Mn3+/4+ redox pair is denoted as Ea and that for Fe3+/4+ is denoted as Eb. The value of Ea of NFMO,
Mn–Ti10, and Fe–Ti10 was 0.47, 0.67, and 0.64 V for
the first scan and it changed to 0.50, 0.47, and 0.47 V at the fourth
cycle, respectively. This means that the reversibility of the electrochemical
reaction (Mn3+/4+) of NFMO reduced, whereas those of the
other samples enhanced during the four scans. Similarly, the values
of Eb of NFMO, Mn–Ti10, and Fe–Ti10
are 0.89, 0.98, and 0.85 V for the first scan and they changed to
0.87, 0.95, and 0.84 V at the fourth cycle, respectively. This means
that the reversibility of the electrochemical reaction (Fe3+/4+) of all samples was enhanced during the four scans. In addition,
the shapes of the respective CV curves appear different: NFMO exhibited
sharp redox peaks, whereas the other two samples showed broad peaks,
which indicates that NFMO would have a more distinct voltage plateau
during cycling.

Figure 5 CV profiles of (a) NFMO, (b) Mn–Ti10, and (c) Fe–Ti10
at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in the voltage range
of 1.5–4.2 V.

Figure 6 shows
the
initial charge and discharge profiles of the samples measured at 13
mA g–1 (0.05 C) in the potential range of 1.5–4.2
V. Generally, NaMeO2 with a layered structure has a profile
with multiple plateaus during sodiation/desodiation due to phase transitions.
These plateaus related with the phase transition can negatively affect
the rate capability and cycling stability.11−15,20,36,40 NFMO shows a phase transition
from P2 to OP4/″Z″ above 4.0 V during the charging process,
which badly affects the cycling stability.15,17 In particular, above 4.0 V, the charge profiles of both Fe–Ti05
and Fe–Ti10 are smoother or more sloped than those of NFMO,
Mn–Ti05, and Mn–Ti10. This means that the substitution
of Fe by Ti in NFMO can improve the structural stability by preventing
the phase transition from P2 to OP4/″Z″.37,40 The initial discharge capacity of NFMO, Mn–Ti05, Mn–Ti10,
Fe–Ti05, and Fe–Ti10 was 190, 187, 182, 181, and 170
mA h g–1, respectively. Because of the electrochemical
inactivity of the Ti ion, Ti substitution lowered the reversible capacity
relative to NFMO. We could observe the difference in the capacity
decrease caused by Ti substitution among the samples, depending on
which the element was replaced by Ti (Mn or Fe). As could be seen
in the XPS result represented in Figure 5, the ratio of Mn3+ in Mn–Ti10
increased, whereas the total amount of Mn reduced, which resulted
in a smaller capacity decrease than Fe–Ti10. Fe–Ti10,
which contains the largest amount of Mn3+, exhibited the
lowest discharge capacity among the samples. This was attributed to
the decrease in the amount of Fe3+ and total Fe, which
has a greater impact on the capacity than Mn3+. However,
caution should be exercised when interpreting the difference in capacity
among the samples only by the XPS result as it only reflects the information
on the surface chemistry. The difference in capacity may be related
with the phase transition to OP4/″Z″ to a greater extent.
The phase transition adversely affects the structural stability but
positively contributes to the capacity, exhibiting a long plateau
in the capacity–voltage profile during discharge. Thus, NFMO
shows the largest capacity, and the samples in which Ti is substituted
for Fe exhibit reduced discharge capacity, thereby preventing the
phase transition to OP4/″Z″. The black, blue, and green
arrows in the cyclic voltammograms (Figure 5) present the potential at which the reduction
of Fe4+ to Fe3+ is complete for the NFMO, Mn–Ti10,
and Fe–Ti10 samples, respectively. The black, blue, and green
points in Figure 6 correspond
to the potential indicated by the black, blue, and green arrows, respectively.
Combining these figures, we could see that the contribution of Fe3+/4+ to the overall discharge capacity of Fe–Ti10 was
greatly reduced, and this reduction was caused by the prevention of
the phase transition. The ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
was carried out for the electrodes charged up to 4.0 and 4.2 V to
confirm the effect of Ti substitution on phase transition. As shown
in Figure S1a,b, all of the electrodes
exhibited the P2 phase at 4.0 V, but NFMO and Mn–Ti10 showed
significant phase transition to OP4 at 4.2 V, whereas Fe–Ti10
almost maintained P2 phase. We could confirm that Ti substitution
for Fe could prevent the phase transition to OP4 from this result.33

Mn–Ti10, Fe–Ti05, and Fe–Ti10.

Figure 7 shows the
rate capability of the samples tested at various current densities.
All samples showed reduced discharge capacities when the current density
was increased from 13 to 1040 mA g–1. As shown in
the figures, the rate capabilities of the Ti-substituted samples were
enhanced, with the capacity retention rates of the 5% Ti-substituted
samples being enhanced the most at high current densities. At the
same time, the rate capabilities of the samples in which Fe was substituted
by Ti were higher than those of the Mn samples doped with Ti. The
rate capability has been reported to be closely related to the NaO2 slab size that supports diffusion of the Na ion, and in our
study, this was also confirmed by the correlation between the rate
capability and the layer structure illustrated in Figure 2.36,40

(d) Fe–Ti05, (e) Fe–Ti10, and (f) discharge capacity

Figure 8 shows the
cycling stabilities and discharge/charge efficiencies measured at
0.05 C (13 mA g–1) and 0.5 C (130 mA g–1) for each material. As shown in Figure 7a, the charge and discharge efficiencies
of each material were close to 100% at 0.05 C. After 45 cycles, the
capacity retention rates of NFMO, Mn–Ti05, Mn–Ti10,
Fe–Ti05, and Fe–Ti10 were approximately 77, 74, 76,
81, and 84%, respectively. In the case of the sample in which Ti is
substituted for Mn, the capacity retention rate was lower than that
of NFMO at 0.05 C, whereas the capacity retention rate of the sample
in which Fe is substituted by Ti was significantly increased. This
is closely related to the reversibility in the electrochemical reaction
shown in Figure 5.

performance and Coulombic efficiency of each cathode at
(a) 0.05 C (13 mA g–1) and (b) 0.5 C (130 mA g–1) in the potential of 1.5–4.2 V.

As shown in Figure 8b, at 0.5 C (130 mA g–1), the capacity
of NFMO
stabilized after rapidly decreasing up to ∼20 cycles. This
rapid capacity fading at an early stage is associated with the low
discharge/charge efficiency. In spite of the capacity stabilization
after ∼20 cycles, the capacity retention rate after 45 cycles
was only approximately 37%. The capacity retention rates of Mn–Ti05,
Mn–Ti10, Fe–Ti05, and Fe–Ti10 after 45 cycles
were approximately 42, 43, 48, and 64%, respectively. All of the Ti-substituted
materials had higher capacity retention rates than NFMO at 0.5 C.
This means that the capacity retention rate at high current density
can to a larger extent be attributed to Ti substitution, and this
is believed to be related with the bonding energy. In other words,
the higher bonding energy of the Ti–O bond (ΔHf298K = 662 kJ/mol) than those of Fe–O (ΔHf298K = 409
kJ/mol) and Mn–O (ΔHf298K = 402 kJ/mol) would improve
both the structural and cycling stabilities.41 Specifically, when Ti is substituted for Fe, the structural stability
could be further improved by controlling the phase transition to OP4/″Z″,
thereby greatly improving the capacity retention rate compared to
when Ti is substituted for Mn.

Figure 9 presents
the results of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement
for NFMO, Mn–Ti10, and Fe–Ti10 after the 1st and 30th
cycles. All of the Nyquist plots have two semicircles, with that appearing
at high frequencies corresponding to the film resistance (Rf) representing the resistance against the transport
of Na ions through the solid electrolyte interface film and that appearing
at mid-frequencies representing the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface between the electrode and
the electrolyte.37,51Figure 9a shows that NFMO has much larger Rf and Rct values
than the other samples. After 30 cycles, all of the samples exhibited
increased Rct, whereas Rf did not show significant change (Figure 9b). Among the samples, Rct of NFMO increased the most, followed by an increase
in Rct in the order of Mn–Ti10
and Fe–Ti10. The value of Rct is
related with the cycling stability, and we can confirm that the cycling
stabilities were improved in the order of a smaller Rct value.31,37

3 Conclusions
We proposed Ti substitution for Fe or Mn in NFMO to improve the
electrochemical properties of NFMO. The Ti-substituted samples delivered
lower discharge capacities than that of NFMO. In particular, the discharge
capacity lowered more when Fe was replaced by Ti. This difference
in the discharge capacity is believed to be associated with the change
in the lattice constant along the c-axis involved
in phase transition at above 4.0 V. Furthermore, the rate capability
and the cycling stability were greatly improved by Ti substitution.
The improved rate capability is attributed to the enlarged space for
the Na-ion transport in the NaO2 slab sandwiched between
the MeO2 (M = Fe, Mn) slabs. The cycling stability of different
samples depended on the current density. Although the cycling stability
of all samples was similar at a low current density (0.05 C), the
Ti-substituted samples exhibited superior cycling stability to NFMO
at a high current density (0.5 C). The higher cycling stability was
attributed to high charge/discharge efficiency. From these results,
we concluded that Ti substitution, especially of Fe, is an effective
approach to enhance the electrochemical properties of P2-type NFMO.

4.1 Synthesis
P2-type
sodium iron manganese
oxides—Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2, Na0.67Fe0.50Mn0.45Ti0.05O2, Na0.67Fe0.50Mn0.40Ti0.10O2, Na0.67Fe0.45Mn0.50Ti0.05O2, and Na0.67Fe0.40Mn0.50xTi0.10O2—were synthesized by a solid-state
reaction and are denoted as NFMO, Mn–Ti05, Mn–Ti10,
Fe–Ti05, and Fe–Ti10, respectively. Na2CO3 (Samchun), Fe2O3 (Samchun), Mn2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich), and TiO2 (Daejung)
were homogeneously mixed together and precalcined at 450 °C for
6 h in air. Then, the precalcined material was pelletized, and the
pellet was calcined at 900 °C for 15 h in air.

4.2 Characterization
XRD analyses were
carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Ultima VI) over
the 2θ range of 10°–80° with monochromatized
Cu Kα radiation. Crystal structures were refined using the powder
profile refinement program GSAS, for which the initial structural
model of Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 was adopted from the literature.42 The
refinement parameters were the scale factors, background, unit-cell
parameters, peak-profile coefficients, atomic coordinates of the oxygen
atoms, occupancies of the sodium atoms, and isotropic thermal parameters.
The total amount of sodium in each sample was restrained to conform
to the nominal chemical composition.

The atomic compositions
of the samples were analyzed by inductively coupled ICP–OES
(Optima 8300, PerkinElmer). The morphology of the powder was observed
using high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM, Sigma 500, ZEISS). The surface chemistry of the samples was
analyzed by XPS using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (MultiLab
2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a Mg Kα X-ray
source.

4.3 Electrochemical Properties
The electrochemical
properties of the samples were measured with CR2032 coin-type cells.
The cathode was prepared by casting a slurry on an aluminum foil with
a doctor blade. The slurry was composed of an active material, a conductive
agent (Super P, TIMCAL), and poly(vinylidene difluoride) (KF1300,
Kureha) with a mass ratio of 80:10:10. Then, the cathode was vacuum
dried in an oven at 120 °C for 12 h. The sodium metal was used
as a counter electrode. A 1.0 M solution of NaClO4 in EC/PC
(volume 1:1) was prepared and used as an electrolyte. A glass fiber
membrane was employed as a separator. All of the coin-type cells were
assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox. The coin-type cells were subjected
to galvanostatic cycling using a cycler (PNE Solution) at various
current densities in a voltage range of 1.5–4.2 V. CV analysis
was also conducted for the cells at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic data were collected
from 0.5 mHz to 1 MHz for the cells using an electrochemical workstation
(Biologic VSP).
