In recent years, superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic
membranes have shown promising results in advanced oil/water separation.
However, these membranes still have some drawbacks, like tedious preparation
process and instability, which hinder their application in oil/water
separation. Accordingly, the development of a facile approach to prepare
superhydrophilic membranes with excellent oil/water separation performance
is still coveted. Here, a copper mesh decorated with cauliflower-like
nickel (Cu mesh@CF-Ni) is synthesized via a facile one-step electrodeposition
method. Due to the surface polar −OH and −O–Ni–F
groups of the Ni(OH)2/NiOxFy shell of the cauliflower-like nickel (CF-Ni),
this Cu mesh@CF-Ni displays superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic
wettability. The results show that the Cu mesh@CF-Ni has excellent
oil/water separation efficiency (higher than 99.2%) and ultrahigh
water flux (around 20 L h–1 cm–2). Moreover, it also displays good stability in a 10 wt % NaCl solution
and 1 M NaOH solution for oil/water separation. By introducing the
CF-Ni with polar Ni(OH)2/NiOxFy components onto the surface of the
materials via a simple electrodeposition method, the materials will
acquire the capability to not only achieve oil/water separation but
also realize many other applications, like self-cleaning, underwater
bubble manipulation, and fog harvesting.

1 Introduction
Clean water is one of the most vital resources for social development.
Unfortunately, clean water scarcity has been continuously worsening
in recent decades due to increasing water pollution. Among the major
concerns are various water contaminants, such as oil pollutants, which
are mainly released into the environment by crude oil spill mishap1,2 as well as industrial oily wastewater3 from the oil refinery industry, cosmetics industry, and food processing
industry. Traditional oil/water separation methods, such as air flotation,4,5 centrifugation, chemical de-emulsification, absorption,6−9 and polymeric membrane separation,10,11 usually have
drawbacks, such as high cost, low efficiency, and membrane fouling.
Therefore, it is critical to develop advanced technologies or materials
to address the ongoing oily wastewater crisis worldwide.

As widely known, materials with superwettability (i.e., superhydrophilicity
or superhydrophobicity) have shown promising results for oil/water
separation in the past decade.12−16 Compared to superhydrophobic materials, superhydrophilic materials17,18 have many advantages, like anticlogging, antifouling, and high efficiency,
for the separation of oil/water mixtures. Decorating metal meshes
with superhydrophilic species is the most popular method to design
superhydrophilic membranes for advanced oil/water separation. To date,
various metal meshes coated with superhydrophilic hydrogel,19 copper,20 Cu(OH)2,3 zeolite,21 TiO2,13,22,23 Co3O4,24 graphene
oxide,25 waste potato,26 and nickel27 have been reported,
and they have exhibited good performance in oil/water separation.
However, such materials still have drawbacks that hinder their industrial
applications in oil/water separation, such as their tedious preparation
process, expensive reagents, and thermal instability. Therefore, the
development of a facile approach to prepare superhydrophilic membranes
with superior oil/water separation ability is in great demand.

In our previous work, we synthesized superhydrophilic materials
using a universal fluorine-induced superhydrophilicity (FIS) method
through a simple and low-cost oxy-fluorination process,28 and those fluorine-induced superhydrophilic
materials display excellent stability. By combining the FIS and porous
materials,29,30 a facile approach to address
the oily wastewater crisis can be implemented.

Here, Cu mesh@CF-Ni was synthesized via a simple one-step electrodeposition
method in a fluorine-containing electrolyte. Different from our previous
work,27 we utilized nickel foam to replace
nickel foil as the nickel resource to synthesized the Cu mesh@CF-Ni.
Due to the large specific surface area of nickel foam, the speed of
electrodeposition was enhanced, and the cauliflower-like nickel with
fluorine-containing shell was obtained. The Cu mesh@CF-Ni was analyzed
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). Due to the surface polar −OH and −O–Ni–F
groups of the Ni(OH)2/NiOxFy shell of CF-Ni, this Cu mesh@CF-Ni membrane
displays superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic wettability.
Then the Cu mesh@CF-Ni was evaluated in oil/water separation where
it showed a high oil/water separation efficiency (above 99.2%) and
ultrahigh water flux (around 20 L h–1 cm–2). Also, the remarkable anticorrosive property of Cu mesh@CF-Ni in
10 wt % NaCl solution and 1 M NaOH solution in oil/water separation
was confirmed using an electrochemical method.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Materials
The
schematic illustration of the preparation of the superhydrophilic
Cu mesh@CF-Ni via electrodeposition depicted in Figure 1a shows its application in oil/water separation.
The SEM image shown in Figure 1b reveals that the surface of the original copper mesh is
smooth and exhibits hydrophobicity (WCA = 120°). The Cu mesh@CF-Ni
membrane was synthesized by using nickel foam as the nickel source
during the nickel electrodeposition process (Figure S1). The electrodeposition process was drastic due to the large
specific surface area of nickel foam, causing the irregular morphology
of CF-Ni (Figure 1c,d).
The Cu mesh@CF-Ni membrane displays superhydrophilic wettability (WCA
= 4°, inset of Figure 1c), and the water droplet spreads out very fast on the Cu
mesh@CF-Ni (see Figure S2). At the same
time, the pore size of the Cu mesh@CF-Ni membrane was reduced after
electrodeposition. The superhydrophilic wettability and the reduced
pore size of the Cu mesh@CF-Ni membrane are beneficial to the subsequent
oil/water separation. Noteworthy, the CF-Ni shows a cauliflower-like
appearance (Figure 1d,e), which is similar to the structure reported in previous work.31 This cauliflower-like structure with large roughness
will benefit the formation of superhydrophilic materials.

To characterize the crystal structure and surface components of
the Cu mesh@CF-Ni material, XRD and XPS analyses were conducted. The
XRD spectrum of the Cu mesh@CF-Ni material shown in Figure 2a reveals that it is composed
of Cu and Ni, which is consistent with the standard cards (JCPDS-04-0836
and JCPDS-04-0850, respectively). Thus, the major component of CF-Ni
is the metal Ni. As shown in Figure 2b, the surface of CF-Ni consists of four kinds of elements,
namely, 39.85% O, 23.67% Ni, 30.20% C, and 6.28% F. The surface F
and O come from the surface oxidation and fluoridation in the nickel
electrodeposition. Additionally, as shown in Figure 2c, after the peak splitting of Ni 2p3/2, the surface Ni species are composed of metal Ni, NiO,
Ni(OH)2, and NiFn, which have
been confirmed at 852.0,32 853.7,33 855.5,34 and 857.6
eV,35 respectively. Also, the binding energy
of F 1s in Figure 2d was determined to be about 684.0 eV, fitting the typical value
of surface F species.36 Therefore, the
CF-Ni is composed of a Ni(OH)2/NiO/NiFn shell and a Ni metal core.

spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum and higher resolution (c) Ni 2p3/2 and (d) F 1s spectra of Cu mesh@CF-Ni.

We further examined the CF-Ni unit by TEM analysis. The TEM image
shown in Figure 3a
reveals the irregular appearance of the CF-Ni unit, which consists
of a rough shell (Figure 3b). This structure can greatly increase the specific surface
area, forming a thicker layer of adsorbed water for advanced oil/water
separation. Additionally, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
pattern of the CF-Ni unit indicated that the major ingredient of CF-Ni
is metal Ni (Figure 3c), which is consistent with the result of the XRD analysis. The
high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of the CF-Ni unit, shown in Figure 3d, reveals lattice
parameters of 0.203, 0.176, and 0.46 nm, which are attributed to Ni
(111),37 Ni (200) (JCPDS-04-0850), and
Ni(OH)2 (001),38 respectively.
According to a previous report, NiO and NiFn can combine with each other to form amorphous NiOxFy.35 Thus, the lattice parameters of NiO and NiFn do not correspond to those in Figure 3d. Given the interaction between NiO and NiFn, the functional Ni(OH)2/NiO/NiFn shell can be expressed as Ni(OH)2/NiOxFy with
polar terminal groups in the form of −O–Ni–F
(Figure 2c,d) and −OH
(Figure S3). Additionally, the image in Figure 3e shows that Ni,
O, and F are evenly distributed. Due to the surface polar −OH
and −O–Ni–F groups of the Ni(OH)2/NiOxFy shell of CF-Ni,
this Cu mesh@CF-Ni exhibits superhydrophilicity.

2.2 Wettability of Cu mesh@CF-Ni
It is
widely known that the wettability of the membrane has a crucial role
in oil/water separation applications.39,40 As mentioned
above, the Cu mesh@CF-Ni exhibits superhydrophilicity. It is beneficial
to form an adsorbed water layer to enhance the oil/water separation
efficiency. However, this efficiency also relies on its underwater
oleophobicity. In this section, we analyzed the underwater oleophobicity
of the Cu mesh@CF-Ni as depicted in Figure 4a, using a manmade glass tank (Figure 4b). The underwater adhesive
effect between the oil droplet and the Cu mesh@CF-Ni membrane is illustrated
in Figure 4c. The shape
of the oil droplet remained almost the same when it left the surface
of Cu mesh@CF-Ni, indicating that the adhesive force between the oil
droplet and the Cu mesh@CF-Ni is negligible. Also, the OCAs and OSAs
of five selected oils on the Cu mesh@CF-Ni membrane were measured
(Figure 4d). It is
established that the OCA is above 155° and the OSA is below 10°
for each oil. According to previous reports,21,23,41 this superhydrophilic Cu mesh@CF-Ni material
displays underwater superoleophobicity with low oil adhesion.

contact angle (OCA) and oil sliding angle (OSA). (b) The corresponding
real device. (c) Underwater oil adhesive effect of the Cu mesh@CF-Ni
membrane. (d) The OCAs and OSAs of five selected oils on the Cu mesh@CF-Ni
membrane.

2.3 Oil/Water Separation
During the oil/water
separation process, a series of oil/water mixtures were separated
once with this Cu mesh@CF-Ni membrane, and then the residual oil concentration
in the separated water was measured. The separation efficiency was
calculated as previously described19 1  

Figure 5a illustrates the visual oil/water separation process.
To illustrate it more clearly, the oil and water are dyed red and
blue, respectively. Water permeated through the membrane immediately,
and oil was retained above (see Movie S1). The residual oil contents of the five selected oils were below
5 ppm, and the separation efficiency was above 99.2%. The Cu mesh@CF-Ni
membrane showed excellent oil/water separation performance (Figure 5b). Then its durability
was evaluated by performing 30 cycles of hexane/water separation,
which revealed that the Cu mesh@CF-Ni has good durability. The water
flux was around 20 L h–1 cm–2,
which is much higher than that previously reported.3,42−44

2.4 Anticorrosive Experiments
Due to
the corrosivity of industrial wastewater, the corrosive solution might
destroy the micro/nanostructures as well as the wettability of membranes.
Therefore, the anticorrosion properties of membranes are important
to the industrial oil/water separation. Here, an electrochemical method
was used to assess the stability of the Cu mesh@CF-Ni membrane for
oil/water separation in 1 M NaOH, 10 wt % NaCl solutions, and 1 M
HCl. The Tafel polarization curves of the Cu mesh@CF-Ni membrane in
four kinds of solutions are shown in Figure 6a, and the corresponding corrosion current
density are summarized in Table S1. The
corrosion current density of the Cu mesh@CF-Ni membrane in 1 M HCl
solution is 501.2 μA cm–2, which is significantly
larger than those in H2O (1.6 μA cm–2), 1 M NaOH (25.1 μA cm–2), and 10 wt % NaCl
(31.6 μA cm–2), indicating that the Cu mesh@CF-Ni
membrane has poor stability in the 1 M HCl solution. After being immersed
in the three aforementioned solutions for 1 h, the micro/nanostructures
of CF-Ni were destroyed in 1 M HCl solution but remained the same
in 10 wt % NaCl solutions and 1 M NaOH solutions (Figure S4). Thereafter, oil/water separation experiments were
conducted in 10 wt % NaCl solution and 1 M NaOH solution. In Figure 6b, the Cu mesh@CF-Ni
membrane also showed underwater superoleophobicity in 1 M NaOH and
10 wt % NaCl solutions, and the separation efficiencies were above
98.5 and 99%, respectively. Additionally, the Cu mesh@CF-Ni membrane
has good stability in 10 wt % NaCl solution and 1 M NaOH solutions
for oil/water separation.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated the Cu mesh@CF-Ni material via a facile
electrodeposition method for application in advanced oil/water separation.
This Cu mesh@CF-Ni membrane displays superhydrophilicity and underwater
superoleophobic wettability due to the surface polar −OH and
−O–Ni–F groups of the Ni(OH)2/NiOxFy shell of the
CF-Ni unit. The experimental results demonstrated that the Cu mesh@CF-Ni
membrane has high oil/water separation efficiency (>99.2%) with strong
durability and ultrahigh water flux (around 20 L h–1 cm–2). Additionally, it displays good stability
in 10 wt % NaCl solution and 1 M NaOH solution. By introducing the
CF-Ni with polar Ni(OH)2/NiOxFy components onto the surface of the
materials by a simple electrodeposition method, these materials acquire
the capability for many other applications, such as self-cleaning,45 underwater bubble manipulation,46 and fog harvesting.47,48

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Preparation of Cu mesh@CF-Ni
The
400# copper mesh (purity ≥99.5%) was cut into 3 cm × 3
cm pieces and cleaned by an ultrasonic cleaner (40 kHz) with 10 wt
% H2SO4, deionized water, ethanol, and deionized
water.49 The Cu mesh@CF-Ni was obtained
using an electrochemical cell with a two-electrode distance of 1.5
cm. The cathode and the anode were the cleaned copper mesh and a piece
of nickel foam (3 cm × 3 cm size, 99.7% purity), respectively.
The electrolyte consisted of 99.85 wt % H2O and 0.15 wt
% NH4F. The electrodeposition was carried out at 4 V for
1 h, and the electrolyte was kept at a temperature of 25 °C.

4.2 Materials Characterization
Characterization
of the morphology of the Cu mesh@CF-Ni material was carried out by
SEM, using a JSM-6510LV scanning electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan), and TEM, using a Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope
(FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR, USA). The surface components were analyzed
by XPS using an ESCALAB250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The crystal structure was confirmed
by XRD analysis using an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer (Malvern Panalytical
Inc., Malvern, U.K.). The water contact angle (WCA), underwater oil
contact angle (OCA), underwater oil sliding angle (OSA), and underwater
oil adhesive effect were measured with an OCA20 contact angle tester
(Data Physics Instruments GmbH, Filderstadt, Germany). The dynamic
water spreading effect on the interfaces was tested by a 5 μL
deionized droplet and was monitored with a Phantom V.211 high-speed
camera (Vision Research, Wayne, NJ, USA) by capturing at 3000 fps.

4.3 Oil/Water Separation
Five oils (n-hexane, n-hexadecane, isooctane, paraxylene,
and petroleum ether) were selected for the oil/water separation experiments.
The oil/water mixture ratio is 10 (wwater/woil = 10). Two glass tubes (d = 1.5 cm) and a Cu mesh@CF-Ni placed between these tubes
were fastened with a flange and clamps. When the mixture was filled
into the tube, the water separated into a beaker below.

After
separation, 1 M HCl was used to acidify the water in the lower tube
(60 mL) to pH = 1–2, and 2 g of NaCl was added into the water
to demulsify it. Then 40 mL of CCl4 was used to extract
twice, and anhydrous Na2SO4 was used to dry
the extractant. Eventually, the oil concentration in CCl4 was measured using an infrared oil concentration analyzer (OIL-8,
China).30,50

4.4 Anticorrosive Experiments
The electrochemical
corrosion measurements of Cu mesh@CF-Ni in corrosive solutions (i.e.,
10 wt % NaCl, 1 M HCl, and1 M NaOH) were performed on a CHI760 workstation
(CH Instruments Inc., Austin, TX, USA). The working, reference, and
counter electrodes were the Cu mesh@CF-Ni, a saturated calomel electrode
(SCE), and a Pt wire, respectively. Polarization curves were plotted
by scanning the potential from (E −0.5 V)
to (E +1.25 V) with a scan rate of 1 mV s–1, where E is the open circuit potential. Then the
oil/solution mixture (wsolution/woil = 10, solution is 10 wt % NaCl or 1 M NaOH)
was separated using the Cu mesh@CF-Ni; the results were compared to
those of the oil/water mixture separation.
