Here, naphthalene
diamine-based β-diketone derivative (compound
LH) was successfully used as a dual signaling probe for divalent cations,
Fe2+ and Cu2+ ions, in bimodal methods (colorimetric
and fluorometric). It showed fluorescent enhancement for Fe2+ ion by photoinduced electron transfer mechanism and fluorescence
quenching for Cu2+ ion by charge-transfer process. Binding
stoichiometry for [LH–(Fe2+)2] and [LH–(Cu2+)2] was found to be 1:2 by Job’s plot method
and, the binding constants were calculated as 1.6638 × 1010 and 9.22929 × 108 M–1,
respectively. Compound LH exhibited OR and XOR logic gate behavior
with H+, Fe2+, and Cu2+ as inputs.
Further, the compound LH and bovine serum albumin binding interaction
showed quenching of fluorescence by Förster resonance energy-transfer
mechanism.

1 Introduction
Chemosensors
have gained much attention due to their recognition
of heavy-metal ions and importance in the environmental and biological
concentration.1,2 Chemosensors are primarily attractive
due to local observation, sensitive ion-induced fluorescence changes,
and real-time examination of the metal-ion content. The metal binding
eventually causes a change in fluorescence intensity. Sensors mostly
present are linked to a fluorophore and metal-chelating site.3 The development of sensitive chromogenic probes
has been receiving much attention in recent years due to their potential
application in clinics, biochemistry, and environment. So far, many
chromogenic chemosensors have been developed for selective recognition
of different species due to their high sensitivity, selectivity, and
simplicity.4 Among metal ions, copper (Cu2+) and iron (Fe2+) are two of the most important
transition-metal ions found in both humans and animals. The drinking
water standards and health advisories amounts of copper and iron are
limited to 1.0 and 0.3 mg L–1, as revised by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).5,6 Iron
is one of the most important elements for metabolic processes (hemoglobin,
myoglobin, and a key element in heme enzymes), being indispensable
for plants and animals, and therefore it is extensively distributed
in environmental and biological materials.7,8 Overdosage
of iron is toxic to the heart and liver and therefore causes neuroinflammation
and Alzheimer’s disease.9,10 Copper is one of the
most significant trace-metal nutrients in our body. It plays a vital
role in various processes in organisms and human health. Excessive
copper is highly toxic and may cause Wilson’s disease in humans.11,12

Recently, a field of intensive research to design bi- and
multifunctional
fluorescent ion probes has emerged.13,14 The metal-ion
detection for biological samples is highly dependent on pH and environment
and can be performed at low concentration, and the fluorescence responses
depend on several mechanisms.15−17 Developing low-cost dual sensors
with high stability and sensitivity represents another challenge in
the current research, i.e., to develop a dual-mode optical response,
a probe that can selectively detect several analytes. In this endeavor,
we have developed a dyad system (keto-amine of (Z)-5-(5-((Z)-4-oxopent-2-en-2-ylamino) naphthalen-1-ylamino)
pent-3-en-2-one) LH, which contains bis-bidentate N, O sites. This
molecule acts as an “ON/OFF” fluorescent chemosensor
for divalent iron and copper ions. We explored the molecular logic
gate behavior of compound LH with H+, Fe2+,
and Cu2+ ions as inputs. Further, to understand the binding
capability of compound LH to biomolecular carriers, bovine serum albumin
(BSA) protein binding study was also explored.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
The
naphthalene diamine
β-diketone derivative of LH, the keto-amine of ((Z)-5-(5-((Z)-4-oxopent-2-en-2-ylamino) naphthalen-1-ylamino)
pent-3-en-2-one), was synthesized by Schiff base condensation reaction18,19 between naphthalene-1,5-diamine and acetylacetone in ethanol, as
illustrated below (Scheme 1).

2.2 UV–Visible
and Fluorescence Spectral
Studies
The spectroscopic properties of LH have been investigated
by UV–vis absorption spectra and fluorescence emission spectra
in H2O/dimethylformamide (DMF) medium. Compound LH showed
maximum absorption wavelength at 330 nm. When treated with various
cations like Zn2+, Na+, Pb2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Cd2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, and Al3+,
compound LH showed a hyperchromic shift centered at 330 nm for Fe2+ and Cu2+ ions. This shows that compound LH is
selective toward Fe2+ and Cu2+ ions (Figure 1a,b).

Figure 1 (a) Absorbance spectra
of compound LH with various metal ions.
(b) Fluorescence spectra of compound LH with various metal ions in
water/DMF (9.9/0.1).

Fluorescent responses of compound LH showed that when excited
at
330 nm, LH exhibited weak fluorescence emission upon addition of various
metal cations. However, on the addition of Fe2+ ion, compound
LH produced strong fluorescence emission at 410 nm. Moreover, the
weak fluorescence of compound LH was further quenched by adding Cu2+ ion, owing to the paramagnetic nature of the latter.20 Hence, compound LH acts as a dual sensor for
Fe2+ with fluorescence enhancement and for Cu2+ with fluorescence quenching. Visual color change of compound LH
upon addition of various metal ions under long-wavelength UV–visible
light (365 nm) was observed. Compound LH showed a light green fluorescence
upon the addition of Fe2+ ion. Addition of other metal
ions did not produce any significant color change under UV–visible
light.21,22

To confirm the selectivity of compound
LH toward Fe2+ and Cu2+ ions, competitive experiments
were performed
with a wide range of metal ions. The resulting fluorescence intensities
are illustrated in Figure 2a,b. As shown in Figure 2a, the competitive cation spectral changes did not
lead to any significant variation in the Fe2+ ion spectra
and resulted in similar fluorescence spectra changes in the presence
of other metal ions. The data clearly suggest that there is no interference
of other metal ions for sensing of Fe2+ ions. Similarly,
the fluorescence quenching caused by the Cu2+ ion with
most other cations was similar to that caused by Cu2+ alone,
as seen in Figure 2b, with not much variation observed in the intensity levels. These
results indicate that the presence of other cations does not interfere
significantly with the binding of LH toward Fe2+ and Cu2+ ions.

2.3 Binding
Interaction
To understand
the binding stoichiometry between compound LH and Fe2+/Cu2+, Job’s plot experiment was carried out. Various mole
fractions of metal ions, Fe2+/Cu2+, viz., 0.1,
0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0, were prepared and
their fluorescence intensities were measured. The concentrations of
these solutions range from 1 × 10–5 to 1 ×
10–4 M. A maximum fluorescence emission intensity
was identified at 410 nm when the mole fraction of Fe2+ reached 0.6, which is indicative of 1:2 stoichiometric complexation
between compound LH and Fe2+ (Figure 3a). Similarly, for Cu2+, the minimum
emission intensity was at 0.6 mol fraction, which indicates the formation
of 1:2 complex (Figure 3b). The association constants on the basis of the Benesi–Hildebrand
equation23,24 (see Figure S12 in the Supporting Information) and Stern–Volmer quenching
equation were calculated as 1.6638 × 1010 and 9.22929
× 108 M–1 for [LH–(Fe2+)2] and [LH–(Cu2+)2], respectively (see Figure S13 in the
Supporting Information). The detection limits were calculated on the
basis of the fluorescence titrations to be 5 × 10–7 M for [LH–(Fe2+)2] and 1 × 10–7 M for [LH–(Cu2+)2] (see Figure S10 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Job’s
plots indicating (a) 1:2 stoichiometry for [LH–(Fe2+)2] complex and (b) 1:2 stoichiometry for [LH–(Cu2+)2] complex.

To further understand the interaction between compound LH
and Fe2+/Cu2+ ions, 1H NMR titration
experiments
for Fe2+ and Cu2+ were carried out in dimethyl
sulfoxide. The 1H NMR peak of imine proton of compound
LH is found at 12.95 ppm. Upon complexation with Fe2+ ions,
the imine proton is shifted downfield to 14.2 ppm. Similarly, on the
addition of Cu2+ to LH, the N–H peak was broadened
and shifted downfield to 15.65 ppm. These results clearly showed that
the coordination takes place in the imine nitrogen and the carbonyl
group of compound LH (Figure 4). The compound LH was found to be reversible with ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) solution. On adding Fe2+ ion, the fluorescence
emission of compound LH was enhanced. But when EDTA was treated with
LH–Fe2+ complex, the fluorescence became weak since
EDTA is bound to Fe2+ ion leaving the chemosensor free.
The same reversibility experiment was conducted with copper ion. This
showed that the compound LH is reversible with EDTA (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 4 1H NMR spectra of compound LH with Fe2+ and
Cu2+ cations.

2.4 Binding Mechanism for Sensing of Fe2+ and Cu2+ Ions
The proposed binding mode between
compound LH and Fe2+/Cu2+ is shown in Scheme 2. The nonbonding
electron pair of nitrogen atom transferred to naphthyl ring results
in weak fluorescence emission for LH due to photoinduced electron
transfer (PET) process.25,26

Scheme 2 Proposed Binding
Mode of Compound LH with Fe2+ and Cu2+ Ions
After coordination with Fe2+, the photoinduced electron
transfer (PET) from the receptor (N atom) to the fluorophore (naphthyl
rings) is blocked, resulting in the switching “ON” of
the fluorescence. (Scheme 2) Similarly, Cu2+ is a paramagnetic cation, which
induces fluorescence quenching response.

The fluorophore opens
a nonradiative deactivation channel and facilitates
the transfer of electron or energy, resulting in the fluorescence
quenching response of (LH + Cu2+). The weak fluorescence
of compound LH was completely quenched, which could be ascribed to
the metal–ligand charge transfer (MLCT) mechanism.27 In the complex (LH + Cu2+), paramagnetism
could induce rapid occurrence of the MLCT, and the paramagnetic quenching
property of Cu2+ was much stronger to cover the other possible
mechanisms. Similarly, for the lighted new complex (LH + Cu2+), the paramagnetic quenching property of Cu2+ played
the leading role, so (LH + Cu2+) showed a completely quenched
fluorescence, i.e., switch “OFF”.

2.5 Molecular Logic Gates
OR and XOR
logic functions (Figure 5a,b) with Fe2+ and Cu2+ ions as inputs (Tables 1 and 2) (Scheme 3) for two different pH values, 3.0 (acidic state) and 7 (neutral
state), were selected.28

In neutral condition, the
fluorescence intensity of compound LH
enhanced at 410 nm after adding 1 equiv Fe2+ ion. In acidic
medium, the addition of Fe2+ ion to compound LH exhibited
fluorescence enhancement compared to the neutral condition of compound
LH, along with a red shift. In neutral medium, the fluorescence intensity
of compound LH after adding 1 equiv Cu2+ showed a blue
shift with fluorescence quenching at 410 nm. However, in acidic condition,
compound LH with the addition of Cu2+ exhibited fluorescence
enhancement accompanied by a blue shift (see Figures S7 and S8 in the Supporting Information).

2.6 Fluorescence Imaging of Compound LH with Fe2+
The ability of compound LH to detect Fe2+ ion was examined
by fluorescence imaging. The chemosensor LH was
loaded with 10 μL of Fe2+ at 30 °C for laser
scanning confocal microscopy. The fluorescence images grew brighter
with an increase in the concentration of Fe2+ ion (Figure 6). These images proved
that a strong fluorescence enhancement resulted when Fe2+ was added to compound LH. These results support that compound LH
is an effective fluorescent sensor for Fe2+ metal ion.

image of compound LH with Fe2+ metal ion.

2.7 Binding of Compound LH
to BSA
The
binding titration of compound LH against BSA is shown in Figure 7a. The absorbance
spectrum of BSA showed two absorbance bands, viz., 280 and 330 nm.
The increasing concentration of compound LH led to a hyperchromic
shift with the formation of a new absorbance band at 330 nm (see Figure S14 in the Supporting Information). The
fluorescence spectra for the binding of BSA to compound LH were recorded.
As shown in Figure 7b, fluorescence quenching was observed for the protein by increasing
the concentration of compound LH.

Figure 7 (a) Absorbance and (b) fluorescence spectra
showing the binding
titration of compound LH to BSA.

The Stern–Volmer quenching plot for the interaction
of protein
with compound LH was studied. The binding constant (K) of compound LH to BSA was calculated as 4.96 × 10–2 M–1 (correlation coefficient = 0.99) from Figure 8.

LH.

3 Förster
Resonance Energy Transfer
The overlapping of the absorption
spectra of the acceptor molecule
with the fluorescence emission spectra of the donor molecule is the
indication of compound LH being the acceptor molecule and BSA being
the donor molecule.

The overlap integral is given by  From the spectral overlap
of the fluorescence
emission spectrum of BSA and the absorption spectrum of compound LH
(Figure 9), the overlap
integral J is calculated to be 5.9322 × 10–20 cm3 mol–1 dm3. The K2 value here is 2/3 and then Φ
= 0.15, n = 1.33, and E = 0.06389.
The calculated values of R0 and r are 4.6844 and 7.3275 nm, respectively, which suggests
that the energy transfer from BSA to compound LH occurs with a good
probability.29,30

4 Conclusions
We have developed an ON/OFF dual
fluorescent chemosensor based
on a naphthalene diamine β-diketone derivative LH for the selective
detection of Fe2+ and Cu2+ ions. The fluorescence
emission intensity of LH was remarkably high after the addition of
Fe2+ ion, and quenching was observed after the addition
of Cu2+ ion. The compound LH binds to both the metal ions
in a 1:2 stoichiometry. Binding constants were calculated as 1.6638
× 1010 and 9.22929 × 108 M–1 for [LH–(Fe2+)2] and [LH–(Cu2+)2], respectively. Further, LH exhibited OR and
XOR logic gate behavior with H+, Fe2+, and Cu2+ as inputs. Binding interaction between bovine serum albumin
and compound LH was observed by fluorescence quenching and Förster
resonance energy transfer. On the basis of the results obtained, we
suggest that the compound LH can be used as a dual sensor for simultaneous
detection of Fe2+ and Cu2+ metal ions.
