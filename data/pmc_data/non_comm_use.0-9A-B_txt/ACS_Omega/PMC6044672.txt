One of the challenges in designing
a successful drug-delivery vehicle
is the control over drug release. Toward this, a number of multifunctional
nanoparticles with multiple triggers and complex chemistries have
been developed. To achieve an efficient and maximum therapeutic effect,
a trigger dependent drug-delivery system with sustained release is
desirable. In this paper, we report the use of a combination of thermoresponsive
gold core and polymeric shell nanoparticles that can provide a sustained,
triggered release of doxorubicin, making the system more efficient
compared to individual nanoparticles. The selection of the system
was dependent on the best trigger applicable in biological systems
and a component responsive to that trigger. Because of the best tissue
penetration depth observed for radiofrequency (rf), we chose rf as
a trigger. Whereas the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) provided hyperthermia
trigger on exposure to rf fields, the thermoresponsiveness was endowed
by poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm)-based polymer
shells. AuNPs with three different compositions of shells, only pNIPAm
and p(NIPAm-co-NIPMAm) with the ratio of NIPAm/N-(isopropylmethacrylamide) (NIPMAm) 1:1 (pNIPMAm50) and 1:3 (pNIPMAm75), were synthesized. We observed that
the polymer coating on the AuNPs did not affect the heating efficiency
of AuNPs by rf and exhibited a temperature-dependent release of the
chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin. The nanoparticles were biocompatible,
stable in biologically relevant media, and were able to show a burst
as well as a sustained release, which was rf-dependent. Interestingly,
we observed that when HeLa cells were treated with doxorubicin-loaded
gold core–polymeric shell NPs and exposed to rf for varying
times, the mixture of the two polymeric shell nanoparticles induced
more cell death as compared to the cells treated with single nanoparticles,
suggesting that such multi-nanoparticle systems can be more efficacious
delivery systems instead of a single multicomponent system.

==== Body
Introduction
Conventional drug therapy,
though effective, mostly requires periodic
administration of drugs at concentrations higher than that required
at the target site, which can result in systemic toxicity. Moreover,
its effectiveness is also highly dependent on patient compliance.
To decrease the frequency of administration, dependence on patient
compliance, and enhancing the effective concentration of the drug
at the target site, nanocarriers are being exploited for drug delivery.1,2 The basic properties considered while designing the nanocarriers
are biocompatibility, drug-loading capacity, chemical handles for
bioconjugation of targeting moieties, and control over the release
kinetics of loaded drugs.

Most of the nanocarriers developed
for drug delivery show a sustained
release, where the release is governed by Fickian diffusion,3 thereby providing least control over the release.
Further efforts have led to the next generation “smart”
nanocarriers, in which the release can be triggered in response to
an endogenous or exogenous stimulus. The endogenous stimuli, such
as pH,4−6 redox,7−9 hypoxia,10 and enzymes,11,12 are based on the microenvironment specific to the target sites.
Because these triggers are continuously “ON”, once activated,
the system shows a continuous release. Alternatively, the exogenous
triggers, such as temperature,13 light,14,15 magnetic field,16 and electric current,17 can provide advanced release profiles, also
known as “on demand” release that follows “ON–OFF”
signals. In fact, till date, a number of such nanocarriers, especially
for delivery of nucleic acids, have been reported.18 These systems utilize the difference in melting temperatures
of different nucleic acid sequences for delivery, thereby making their
application highly specific to nucleic acids.19 Similarly, other systems such as nanogels are also being developed
as switchable drug-delivery systems.20,21 In the case
of nanogels, where the release is dependent on deswelling and swelling
properties, on exposure to the stimuli, most of the drug gets released
from the system, thereby resulting in availability of a lower dose
on the next trigger. Yet another approach pursued to achieve a triggered
as well as sustained release is the synthesis of core–shell
nanogels with varying degree of sensitivity to the stimuli.22,23 However, introduction of multiple layers in such systems is challenging
and perhaps involve complex chemistries. In addition, an increase
in the number of layers adds to the complexity of drug release as
well as tends to increase the overall size of the nanoparticles,23 thus increasing the probability of clearance
by the reticuloendothelial system. To overcome these, instead of incorporating
complex or multiple components in a system to control the release
profile, we propose a simple strategy of using a combination of nanoparticles,
each having varying degrees of sensitivity to an exogenous trigger,
thus obtaining a sustained, triggered release. We envision that such
a strategy will allow us to achieve a sustained and triggered release
as the trigger will have varied responses from multiple types of nanoparticles
present in the solution. We hypothesize that single nanoparticles
will be able to give an immediate or triggered burst release; if a
combination of nanoparticles is used where at one condition, only
one type of nanoparticle responds while the other remains dormant
and responds at a different condition, then a dual responsive system
can be developed from simple non-multifunctional nanoparticles. Such
systems can also be helpful in the case of combinatorial therapies,
for example, in the case of cancer treatment where the delivery of
drugs for sensitizing cells to genotoxic drugs is necessary before
the administration of genotoxic drugs to improve the overall efficiency
of the treatment.24

As a proof of
concept, here we report the use of a combination
of thermoresponsive gold core–polymeric shell nanoparticles
for demonstrating the sustained, triggered release of doxorubicin,
a chemotherapeutic agent. Whereas the thermoresponsiveness was endowed
by poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm)-based polymer
shells, the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) provided a hyperthermia trigger
on exposure to radiofrequency (rf) fields. pNIPAm is one of the well-studied
thermoresponsive polymer, with the transition temperature close to
the body temperature. In fact, the transition temperature of the polymer
can be finely tuned by incorporation of different co-monomers such
as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, vinylacetic acid, N-(isopropylmethacrylamide) (NIPMAm), and so forth in the polymer
backbone.25 However, as the use of acids
as a co-monomer also confers pH responsiveness to the nanogel, we
selected NIPMAm for the shell synthesis. Though the biocompatibility
of pNIPAm is one of the concerns limiting its clinical translation,
it has been well-established that the toxicity observed in these systems
is due to the monomer.26 In fact, the polymer
has been shown to be biocompatible at concentrations relevant to many
biomedical applications. On the other hand, AuNPs are widely accepted
for biomedical applications because of their bioinertness and biocompatibility.2,27,28 They exhibit excellent optical
resonance of their surface plasmons, resulting in strong absorbance
at a characteristic wavelength and conversion of the resonance energy
into heat. Although gold nanorods with surface plasmon resonance in
the near-infrared (NIR) region have shown potential, their practical
implementation is limited by the extent of tissue penetration (<2–3
cm).29Because the rf field has better penetration
into the body30 and is also known to efficiently
heat the AuNPs in the size range of <50 nm,31 research is now focused on the use of rf-mediated hyperthermia.

Results
and Discussion
We began our study by designing the dual component
nanoparticle
system for achieving a burst and a sustained release that can be modulated
with a trigger. Usually, a multifunctional approach is utilized to
develop a system capable of delivering cargoes in response to multiple
triggers, thus leading to a sustained, triggered release. However,
because multifunctionality in a single nanoparticle can result in
various synthetic complexities32 and can
also impede the functionality, we developed a multi-nanoparticle system
instead of a single multicomponent system. We explored a AuNP-based
system that can heat up by application of an rf electric field. Because
of their excellent ability to strongly absorb the light and efficiently
convert the photon energy into heat, AuNPs are currently being exploited
in photothermal therapy.14,33 Recently, researchers
have started investigating their ability to generate heat upon exposure
to capacitively coupled rf electric fields. rf is of interest in the
field of biomedicine, owing to its ability to penetrate deep into
the tissues than the currently used NIR wavelengths.

A study
by Moran et al. demonstrated the size-dependent heating
efficiency and concluded that the AuNPs with <50 nm heated at twice
the rate as compared to larger nanoparticles.31 We therefore synthesized ∼20 nm AuNPs (via the well-reported
Turkevich method), as evident from the single peak with absorption
maxima at 520 nm (Figure 1a). The size was also confirmed by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (Figure S2a). To render efficient
drug-loading capabilities to the AuNPs, the commonly adapted strategies
include direct adsorption of the active drug, surface deposition of
charged polymers by the layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly, surface conjugation
of thiolated amphiphilic polymers for generation of hydrophobic pockets
for carrying drugs, and deposition of a porous shell for drug loading
via absorption. The drug-loading efficiency by surface adsorption
is limited by lack of inherent porosity of AuNPs, whereas the tendency
of desorption and destabilization of polymeric layers because of protein
interactions is a concern in LBL-assembled nanoparticles.34 Although, surface conjugation of thiolated polymers
can enhance the drug-loading efficiency, their sensitivity to intracellular
glutathione (GSH) makes the system unsuitable for an externally controlled,
triggered release.9 We therefore opted
for the porous shells for enhancing the drug-loading efficiency of
our system. Additionally, as the trigger will result in the generation
of heat (hyperthermia), a thermoresponsive polymer was desired. Importantly,
the selection of appropriate temperatures for hyperthermia is crucial
as the higher temperatures may cause irreversible cellular damage,
leading to necrosis. This leads to a sudden release of necrotic cell
contents, eventually giving rise to severe inflammatory responses.
Typically, temperatures up to 45 °C35 are preferred for hyperthermia as at this temperature, a series
of subcellular events occur, which make the cells susceptible to damage
without resulting in necrosis. Therefore, temperature-sensitive polymers,
responsive at temperatures between 37 and 45 °C, were selected.
As pNIPAm-based polymers exhibit thermoresponsive property near the
physiological temperature, three core–shell nanoparticles with
varying compositions of pNIPAm and pNIPMAm with N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS) as a cross-linker
were synthesized via a well-known precipitation polymerization method.
Whereas the cross-linker BIS concentration was constant (5 mol %),
the compositions of the polymeric shells synthesized were only pNIPAm
and poly(NIPAm-co-NIPMAm) with NIPAm/NIPMAm in the
ratio of 1:1 and 1:3. These core–shell nanoparticles are named
as pNIPAm, pNIPMAm50, and pNIPMAm75, respectively,
in the manuscript.

After the synthesis of the polymer
shell on AuNPs, a red shift
of 5 nm was observed in the absorbance maxima, indicating successful
surface modification of AuNPs (Figures 1a and S3). No significant
change in the shape of the curve was observed, suggesting the absence
of aggregation of the AuNPs, which otherwise may result in the attenuation
of rf-dependent heating. The TEM images of the core–shells
confirmed the absence of aggregation and the presence of a 2 ±
0.1 nm shell around the AuNP core (Figures 1b and S2). The
nanoparticles were also characterized by DLS. The hydrodynamic diameter
of AuNPs, pNIPAm, pNIPMAm50, and pNIPMAm75 was
found to be 46 ± 2, 66 ± 1, 66.5 ± 5, and 62.5 ±
1 nm, respectively, at 25 °C (Figure 1c). The discrepancy observed in the sizes
of the nanogels by TEM and DLS is as expected because DLS measures
the hydrodynamic diameter, which is always greater than that observed
by TEM. Also, as the samples are dried and imaged under vacuum for
the TEM analysis, the shell tends to shrink, thereby further reducing
the observed size in TEM. The surface charge of the AuNPs was negative
with a reduction in the negative potential on shell formation (Figure 1d). We next investigated
the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the synthesized
nanoparticles, which is the temperature at which the polymer shell
of the nanoparticle deswells. As observed in Figures 1e and S4, a significant
change in the core–shell size was observed for pNIPAm at ∼32
°C, whereas pNIPMAm50 and pNIPMAm75 showed
size changes at around 39 and 40 °C, respectively. These changes
in sizes can be considered significant, owing to the contribution
of the AuNP core to the size of the core–shells. As the polymeric
nanoparticles with more pNIPMAm composition (75 mol %) showed only
28% size reduction even at 47 °C, the temperature at which the
cells could undergo necrosis, it was not considered for further studies.
Thus, we envisioned that at a physiological temperature of 37 °C,
pNIPAm would be deswollen and could be used for immediate release
of the shell-loaded drug, whereas pNIPMAm50 would be mostly
dormant and release the drug only at an elevated temperature. Further,
considering the deswelling observed for pNIPMAm50, we selected
a temperature between 32 and 45 °C, such that it is above the
physiological temperature where pNIPAm would release the loaded drug
and pNIPMAm50 will retain, and at the same time it is below
the necrosis temperature (45 °C). Additionally, to achieve a
triggered release from pNIPMAm50 above the physiological
temperature, 43 °C was selected as the trigger temperature.

With two selected nanoparticles in hand, we proceeded to load doxorubicin,
a potent chemotherapeutic agent, which works by intercalating with
nucleic acids inside the cells, thereby inhibiting cell growth. Because
of overlap of the absorbance spectra of doxorubicin and AuNPs and
a low concentration of doxorubicin in the loaded samples, the loading
efficiency was calculated by fluorescence intensities (ex 485/em 595
nm) after dissolving the AuNP core with aqua regia. As AuNPs have
a broad absorbance spectrum, they can result in quenching of fluorescence
signals.36 Dissolving of the AuNP core
was therefore necessary to eliminate its interference in measuring
the doxorubicin fluorescence. The doxorubicin loading observed was
comparable for core–shell nanoparticles, with 19% (192 μg/mg
of core–shells) loading for pNIPAm and 14% (138 μg/mg
of core–shells) for pNIPMAm50. Additionally, it
was also comparable to the doxorubicin loading observed in liposomes.37,38 On the contrary, only ∼6% (65 μg/mg of AuNPs) loading
was observed for AuNPs (Figure S5a). The
loading was also confirmed by deconvolution of peaks in the absorbance
spectra of doxorubicin-loaded core–shells (Figure S5b).

We first tested our hypothesis that a combination
of nanoparticles
can allow us to achieve a sustained release that can be increased
by a temperature trigger (Figure 2a). We investigated the release profile of doxorubicin
from nanogels of compositions corresponding to the polymeric shells
using equilibrium dialysis. Doxorubicin-loaded pNIPAm, pNIPMAm50, and 1:1 mixture of both the nanogels were dialyzed against
PBS initially at 37 °C for 60 min, after which the temperature
was increased to 43 °C. The initial burst release observed at
15 min can be attributed to doxorubicin adsorbed on the nanoparticle
surface (Figure 2b).
Further, as can be observed from the release profiles in Figure 2b, in the first 30
min, the release profile for pNIPAm (∼65%) was similar to that
of the free doxorubicin control, indicating a burst release attributed
to the deswelling of pNIPAm at 37 °C. Also, a comparatively less
release (∼55%) was observed from pNIPMAm50 initially,
which then stabilized for upto 60 min, thus showing a sustained release
behavior. Further, when the trigger was applied by increasing the
temperature to 43 °C, pNIPAm showed no change in the release
profile as against a significant increase in the drug release by pNIPMAm
(∼30% increase) upto 150 min. Interestingly, the release profile
for a 1:1 mixture of pNIPAm and pNIPMAm50 showed an intermediate
release profile at 37 °C, suggesting the immediate release effect
due to deswelling of pNIPAm and retention of the drug by pNIPMAm50. Further increase in temperature to 43 °C after 60
min resulted in an increase in the release, indicating the trigger-dependent
additional release from pNIPMAm50 of the mixture. Thus,
the initial drug released from the mixture can provide an immediate
effect, whereas a triggered release can provide an additional drug
release from an otherwise sustained releasing system, thereby improving
the overall efficiency of the system. These observations suggest that
indeed a burst as well as a sustained drug-release profile that can
be modulated with a trigger can be easily obtained by using a mixture
of nanoparticles compared to the individual nanoparticles. To investigate
the leakage of doxorubicin from the polymer shells, the release was
also conducted at room temperature. As can be seen in Figure S6a, no significant difference was observed
between pNIPAm and pNIPMAm at an early time point (20 min), whereas
after 60 min, the overall release increased in either of the condition.
However, a significant difference was observed between the release
from pNIPAm and pNIPMAm nanoparticles at 37 °C. The diffusion
of molecules from the nanoparticles is governed by the size and polymer
cross-linking density of the nanoparticles. Reduction in the size
enhances the rate of release, whereas an increase in the polymer cross-linking
density slows the diffusion and hence retards the release. It is interesting
to note that at 37 °C, as the pNIPAm core–shells significantly
reduce in size, the diffusion can be easier, thus increasing the release.
At 37 °C, the increase in the polymer density may retard the
release in comparison with the release at room temperature, which
is also observed in the data. For pNIPAm, retardation is observed
at higher temperature because of slower diffusion due to increased
polymer density, but eventually after 60 min, because of the smaller
size, an overall increase in the release is observed. Although for
pNIPMAm, a slight retardation is observed at higher temperature compared
to that observed at room temperature, because the size does not change,
there is no difference in the release over a longer period. We also
investigated the effect of parameters such as cross-linking density,39 pH,40 and high GSH
(10 mM),41 which have a potential to influence
the drug-release profiles. In this respect, core–shell nanoparticles
with the shell composed of different cross-linking densities of bisacrylamide
were synthesized. As can be observed in Figure S6b, at a low cross-linking density (1 mol % cross-linker),
the release was faster than nanoparticles with a high cross-linking
density (5 mol % cross-linker). Interestingly, a further increase
in the cross-linking density did not show any significant difference
in the release. Therefore, core–shells composed of 5 mol %
bisacrylamide as the cross-linker were used for cell studies. Additionally,
the drug release can also be affected by the acidic pH encountered
by the nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment or when the nanoparticles
are internalized by the cells. Interestingly, though at an acidic
pH, the overall release of doxorubicin was faster, pNIPMAm showed
a less release compared to pNIPAm. The increase in the release rate
can be attributed to the enhanced solubility of doxorubicin hydrochloride
at an acidic pH (Figure S6c). On the other
hand, GSH did not have a significant effect on the release of doxorubicin
(Figure S6d).

After confirming the release profiles and advantage of using
a
combination of nanoparticles for achieving multiple release profiles,
we evaluated the applicability of the nanoparticles as a drug-delivery
system by studying its biocompatibility, hemocompatibility, stability
in biologically relevant media, and ability to generate heat and release
the drug on exposure to rf. We assessed the biocompatibility of gold
core–polymeric shell nanoparticles by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay using HeLa cells, a cervical cancer cell line.
The nanoparticles did not show cytotoxicity at concentrations up to
0.3 nM (Figure S7a). The study on hemolytic
activity of the nanoparticles also confirmed the biocompatibility
of core–shells, as in all cases, the hemolysis was under 5%
(FigureS7b). They were also stable in 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) for up to 9 h, as observed by DLS (Figure S8). The release profile for doxorubicin
loaded core–shells was then evaluated at different temperatures.
As can be observed in Figure S9, after
60 min at 37 °C, pNIPAm showed 30 ± 2% release, whereas
pNIPMAm50 showed only 12 ± 3% release. When the system
was maintained at 43 °C, an increase in the release was observed
for pNIPMAm50. This observation is in corroboration with
the release study from the nanogel. Depending on these temperatures,
we then optimized the rf (13.56 MHz, 150 W) exposure time for our
system to attain the temperatures of 37 and 43 °C. Although a
number of studies have shown the ability of AuNPs to generate heat
on exposure to rf, the mechanisms underlying thermal dissipation are
still not well-understood. Till date, three mechanisms, that is, Joules
type heating, electrophoretic heating, and magnetic heating have been
proposed.42 The efficiency of thermal energy
dissipation also depends on factors such as AuNP size, complexity
of the medium, surface ligands, presence of salts, and rf instrument
specifications.31,43 Recently, a study by Li et al.
demonstrated the influence of even the sample holder shape on the
heating rate of AuNPs on rf exposure.44 Thus, it is important to take into account these parameters while
optimizing the exposure time and temperatures. Exposure of core–shells
in a 96-well plate to rf (13.56 MHz) at 150 W with a standing wave
ratio (SWR) close to 1 for 1 min 30 s resulted in the increase of
temperature to 37 °C, whereas exposure for 3 min increased the
temperature to 43 °C (Figure 2c). Interestingly, the surface modification of AuNPs
by polymeric shells did not affect the heating rate of core–shell
nanoparticles, and it was found to be similar to that of bare AuNPs
(Figure S10). It is worth noting that PBS
by itself also showed a slight increase in the temperature on exposure
to rf, which was only 34 °C after 3 min of rf exposure. In addition,
the temperature attained by corresponding composition nanogels was
similar to that of PBS, suggesting that only AuNPs contribute to the
heating on rf treatment (Figure 2c). The exposure times obtained from this study were
then used for all cellular studies.

Finally, we evaluated the
effect of a sustained and triggered release
of shell-loaded doxorubicin from only pNIPAm, pNIPAM50,
and combination of the two nanoparticles on the HeLa cell line. The
cells were treated with various nanoparticles while the doxorubicin
concentrations were kept constant. After 4 h of incubation, the excess
nanoparticles were removed from the culture media, and the cells with
internalized nanoparticles were treated with rf for either 1 min 30
s or 3 min. Following the rf treatment, the cells were further cultured
for 24 h, after which they were evaluated for cell viability via the
MTT assay. It is well-known that AuNPs may interfere in the absorbance
readout, but considering the very low concentration of AuNPs (upto
0.3 nM), we assume this effect to be negligible. As can be seen from Figure 3a, cells treated
with nanoparticles without doxorubicin (controls) showed no cell death,
whereas those treated with 0.7 μg/mL doxorubicin showed ∼50%
cell death. Additionally, cells treated either with pNIPMAm or the
1:1 combination of pNIPAm and pNIPMAm50 nanoparticles did
not show any cell death in the absence of the rf signal, whereas a
slight reduction in the viability was observed for cells treated with
pNIPAm because of the immediate release of doxorubicin into the medium
at the cell culture temperature (37 °C). Similarly, comparable
toxicity was observed for cells treated with pNIPAm and exposed to
RF for 1 min 30 s and 3 min (Figure 3a), suggesting that all doxorubicin is probably released
within 4 h of culture with nanoparticles. For the pNIPMAm50-treated samples, a slight reduction in viability was observed at
1 min 30 s of rf treatment, which increased to ∼40% cell death
with 3 min of rf treatment. The results observed can again be easily
explained by the release profile curves observed in Figure 2b. As the cell culture temperature
is well below the LCST of pNIPMAm50, most of the doxorubicin
is retained in the nanoparticle shell and released only after cellular
internalization and upon rf application. As the short-time rf does
not increase the temperature above the LCST, no significant decrease
is observed compared to the 3 min rf where the temperature rises above
the LCST, releasing doxorubicin intracellularly. The most striking
results were obtained for samples treated with a combination of nanoparticles,
where ∼67% cell viability was observed on 1 min 30 s of rf
exposure, which reduced significantly to ∼50% cell death upon
3 min of rf exposure. The cell death observed was higher than either
of the single nanoparticles. More importantly, the cell death in the
combination was observed in response to the trigger as without rf,
no cytotoxicity was observed because of low amount of pNIPAm nanoparticles
that can release the drug immediately. This allowed for most of the
loaded drug to get internalized without causing unwanted nonspecific
toxicity, which is desired for doxorubicin as it is known to induce
a remarkable delayed cardiotoxicity.45 With
the combination, we get an advantage of an initial very low concentration
release of doxorubicin at 37 °C, which acts as a first trigger,
with the additional dose of doxorubicin being released specifically
inside the cells after a second trigger on exposure to rf for 3 min.
In the case of only pNIPAm and pNIPMAm50, the effect can
be termed as controlled release but not sustained, as all doxorubicin
was released on exposure to the trigger, either the initial 37 °C
or the second 43 °C. These studies clearly indicate that using
a combination of nanoparticles, sensitive to a single trigger, can
enhance the overall efficiency of the treatment and provide a controlled
yet sustained release of doxorubicin.

the shell composed of a 1:1 ratio of NIPAm/NIPMAm; 1:1 mix: mixture

*: P ≤ 0.05.

We further confirmed the effect of doxorubicin on the cell
viability
by imaging live and dead cells after staining with calcein AM and
PI (Figure 3b). Calcein
AM is a nonfluorescent cell permeable dye, which is converted into
a green fluorescent dye on hydrolysis by intracellular esterases,
thereby staining only live cells, whereas PI, a cell impermeable dye,
stains dead cells as their membrane gets compromised. After 1 min
30 s of rf exposure to the cells treated with doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles,
a few dead cells (red) were observed for pNIPAm as well as the 1:1
mixture, whereas most of the cells were live (green) for pNIPMAm50 nanoparticles. On 3 min of rf exposure, maximum dead cells
were observed for cells treated with a 1:1 mixture of nanoparticles.
The fluorescence images were also used for quantification by counting
the live and dead cells in at least three representative areas of
each sample (Figure 3c). The results obtained were in agreement with the cell viability
analysis by the MTT assay and confirm the enhanced efficiency of drug
delivery in a mixture of nanoparticles as against individual nanoparticles.

Conclusions
Our study suggests a simple alternative to the development of nanoparticles
via complex chemistries for endowing one of the most important properties
for drug delivery, that is, sustained, triggered release of the loaded
drug. Whereas the single nanoparticles did result in cell death, the
effect was enhanced by using a mixture of nanoparticles. pNIPMAm50 showed a pronounced effect in response to exposure to longer
rf hyperthermia period (3 min), which was improved on using them as
a mixture with the pNIPAm-based shell, suggesting the potential of
this concept of using a multi-nanoparticle system as a more efficacious
vehicle instead of single multicomponent vehicles.

AuNP (Core)
Synthesis
AuNPs were synthesized using
the well-known Turkevich method.46 All
glassware and Teflon-coated magnetic beads were first cleaned with
aqua regia and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water. Under vigorous
stirring, 190 mL of 0.1 mg/mL HAuCl4 solution was brought
to boil in a round-bottom flask attached with a condenser. HAuCl4 was then reduced by addition of 10 mL of 1% sodium citrate
trihydrate. The solution turned from dark purple to red wine color
within 10 min and was stirred for another 20 min. It was then brought
to room temperature with continuous stirring. Then, the formed AuNPs
were characterized by ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorbance
spectroscopy, DLS, and TEM. The size obtained by the TEM analysis
and the corresponding molar extinction coefficient47 were used to calculate the AuNP concentration by using
the Beer–Lambert law.

Nanogel (Shell) Synthesis
AuNPs
coated with amine-terminated
pNIPAm (pNIPAm-NH2) were used as the seed for the shell
synthesis. As excess of the polymer can result in the aggregation
of AuNPs,48 we first optimized the amount
of pNIPAm-NH2 that can be used for coating (Figure S1). AuNPs (1 nM) were incubated with
increasing concentration of pNIPAm-NH2 (2500 Da) for 6
h, and their absorbance spectra were recorded. As the aggregation
occurred at concentrations above 3 μM (Figure S1), this concentration was used for coating the AuNPs. Also,
as a free polymer can result in the formation of nanogels without
the AuNP core, as a precaution, the nanoparticles were dialyzed against
deionized water using a 12 kDa dialysis membrane for 4 h to remove
any free unabsorbed pNIPAm-NH2.

The nanogel shells
were then synthesized by precipitation polymerization using pNIPAm-NH2-coated AuNPs as the seed, according to a previously reported
method.49 Briefly, for a 40 mL reaction,
an appropriate amount of monomers, NIPAm and NIPMAm, cross-linker,
BIS, and 130 μL of SDS (0.1 M) were added to the seed. SDS,
an anionic surfactant, is known to be involved in the early stabilization
of nuclei generated during the synthesis, leading to a reduction in
the size of the pNIPAm nanogels.50 The
mixture was heated to 70 °C under a N2 environment
with stirring for 1 h. Freshly prepared APS (260 μL of 0.1 M)
was then injected to initiate the reaction. After ∼20 min,
turbidity was observed, indicating polymer formation. The reaction
was continued for 4 h and was cooled down to room temperature with
continuous stirring. The core–shell nanoparticles were then
washed three times with deionized water by centrifuging at 12 000
rpm for 15 min. Different shell compositions used were (i) 95 mol
% NIPAm and 5 mol % BIS (pNIPAm), (ii) 45 mol % NIPAm, 50 mol % NIPMAm,
and 5 mol % BIS (pNIPMAm50), and (iii) 75 mol % NIPMAm,
20 mol % NIPAm, and 5 mol % BIS (pNIPMAm75), with a total
monomer concentration of 20 mM. Similarly core–shells with
10, 5, and 1 mol % BIS cross-linker densities were also synthesized.
The core–shell nanoparticles were characterized by UV–vis
spectroscopy for the aggregation of AuNPs and shell formation by TEM.
Shell formation was also confirmed by monitoring the temperature-dependent
size of the nanoparticles as analyzed by DLS.

Drug Loading and Loading
Efficiency
The nanoparticles
were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was then
resuspended in 200 μL of 1 mg/mL doxorubicin hydrochloride solution
such that the concentration of core–shell nanoparticles was
15 nM. They were then incubated overnight and washed twice with deionized
water by centrifugation to remove the unabsorbed drug. Drug loading
was confirmed by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy.

The
loading efficiency was calculated by fluorescence spectroscopy. As
the AuNP core interfered with the fluorescence of doxorubicin, they
were first digested with aqua regia, and then the obtained fluorescence
was used to calculate the amount of doxorubicin, using the equation
obtained from a standard plot of doxorubicin in the presence of aqua
regia. It should be noted that the fluorescence of doxorubicin is
affected by aqua regia and decreases with time (data not shown). It
is therefore necessary to record the fluorescence immediately after
addition of aqua regia. The amount of nanoparticles used for loading
was determined by drying a known concentration of core–shells.
The following formula was used for calculating the loading efficiency  

Temperature-Dependent
Drug Release
The release profile
of doxorubicin from nanoparticles was performed at room temperature,
37, and 43 °C by equilibrium dialysis. The release at different
pH values and with core–shells composed of different cross-linking
densities were carried out at 37 °C. The samples were dialyzed
using a 12 kDa cellulose membrane against PBS. For release at acidic
pH, PBS at pH 5 was used as a release medium. They were aliquoted
at different time intervals and analyzed for doxorubicin fluorescence.
The percentage release was calculated using the following formula:  

rf-Assisted
Hyperthermia
A custom-made 13.56 MHz rf
generator was used for the experiments. It was operated at a power
of 150 W while keeping the SWR close to 1. The SWR helps in adjusting
the reflected power value of the total rf power. The samples were
prepared in PBS, brought to room temperature (∼25 °C),
and were exposed to rf for different times. At the end of the exposure,
the temperature of the core–shell nanoparticles was immediately
determined by a digital thermometer. The values obtained were plotted
against time to obtain the heating rate.

Cell Viability by the MTT
Assay
Cervical cancer cell
lines, HeLa, were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS
and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a CO2 incubator. At ∼80% confluency, the cells were trypsinized,
and 104 cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate
and cultured overnight. The media was removed, and fresh media containing
UV-sterilized, doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles at varying concentrations
were added over the cells. The cells were then incubated, and after
4 h, the nanoparticle-containing media were replaced with 40% FBS
in deionized water. They were then exposed to the rf field at 150
W for 1 min 30 s and 3 min. FBS was then replaced with fresh DMEM
+ 10% FBS and further incubated for 24 h. The media was then removed,
and fresh media containing MTT at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL
was added over the cells. After 1 h of incubation, the media was removed,
and the insoluble formazan crystals synthesized by the live cells
were dissolved in 200 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide. Absorbance of
the solution was then recorded at 550 nm using a BioTek SynergyH1
multiplate reader. Cells not treated with nanoparticles were considered
as blank and used to calculate the percentage viability for nanoparticle-treated
cells. Cells treated with nanoparticles without doxorubicin were used
as controls.

Hemolysis Assay
Hemolysis assay
was performed by adding
core–shells at different concentrations to 50 μL of erythrocytes
to a final volume of 250 μL in PBS. After incubation at 37 °C
for 30 min, the cells were centrifuged at 10 000g for 5 min, and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at
540 nm to quantify the cell lysis. Cells untreated with nanoparticles
were used as the negative control, and the cells incubated with 10%
Triton X-100 were used as the positive control.

Live Cell Staining
HeLa cells were seeded in a 96-well
plate at a seeding density of 104 cells per well and cultured
overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2. UV-sterilized, doxorubicin-loaded
nanoparticles were diluted in fresh media, such that the final concentration
of doxorubicin was 0.7 μg/mL, and added over the cells. The
cells were then incubated for 4 h, and the media was replaced with
40% FBS in deionized water. One 96-well plate was exposed to rf (150
W) for 1 min 30 s and other was exposed for 3 min. FBS was then replaced
with fresh DMEM + 10% FBS and further incubated for 24 h. The media
was then removed and fresh media containing 2 μM calcein AM,
a live cell stain, and 2 μM propidium iodide were added over
the cells. After 20 min of incubation, the cells were washed and imaged
under an Olympus IX73 inverted microscope using fluorescein isothiocyanate
and PI filters. The cells without nanoparticle treatment were used
as blank.
