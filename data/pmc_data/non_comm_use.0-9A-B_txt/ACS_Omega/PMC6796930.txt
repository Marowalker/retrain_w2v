Predicting
the ability of chemical species to cross the blood–brain
barrier (BBB) is an active field of research for development and mechanistic
understanding in the pharmaceutical industry. Here, we report the
BBB permeability of a large data set of compounds by incorporating
molecular solvation energy descriptors computed by the 3D-RISM-KH
molecular solvation theory. We have been able to show, for the first
time, that the computed excess chemical potential in different solvents
can be successfully used to predict permeability of compounds in a
binary manner (yes/no) via a minimum-descriptor-based model. Our findings
successfully combine the molecular solvation theory with the machine
learning approach to address one of the most daunting challenges in
predictive structure–activity relationship modeling. The workflow
presented in this work is simple enough to be used by nonexperts with
ease.

Introduction
The tight junction
blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a complex
structure regulating the flow of chemicals into the brain.1,2 The function of BBB is to separate systemic blood flow from the
central nervous system. This in turn controls diffusion and transport
of chemicals between the two. The modes of entrance of a chemical
into the central nervous system are either via diffusion across the
BBB or via a transport system containing (non-)specific transporter
enzymes/proteins. Development of (new) drug candidates that target
different parts of the human central nervous system depends extensively
on the capability of the target molecule to pass the enigmatic BBB.
The most common quantitative index of such a capability of a molecule
is reported by the log BB,3 a logarithmic
ratio of concentrations of drug in the brain and in blood. The experiments
to measure log BB are cumbersome, time-consuming, and low yield. This
promoted development of a plethora of methods involving artificial
membranes for in vitro prediction/measurements. The most common of
these methods is the PAMPA assay, which uses an artificial membrane
to measure, help mimic, and get a crude estimate of passive permeability.4,5 The simplicity of this method is that it produces reliable predictions
based on the lipid membrane, whereas the chief drawback comes from
the absence of any active transporter. Such complexities in generating
log BB data from experiments have promoted in silico methods in predicting
BBB permeability of compounds using multitudes of molecular descriptors.6−10

The application of various computer-aided statistical methods
in
predicting BBB permeability is abundant in the literature.11−15 These reports differ in the number and types of compounds incorporated
in the predictions and the number of descriptors used in the predictive
modeling. This often leads to overfitting and resulting models that
fail to predict log BB values for molecules beyond the class for which
the model is trained. Hence, the size of the database used in training
plays a prominent role in all these modeling methods. We have recently
reported a minimum-descriptor-based model containing solvation energy
parameters for predicting log BB with reasonable accuracy and broad
applicability.16 The very limited availability
of reliable log BB data handicaps the development of log BB prediction
methods. There are efforts to supplement the “black-box”-like
predictive models in ADMET properties based on a data set of ∼200
compounds.17,18 These reports suggest a continuing
need of predictive models for the blood–brain permeability
prediction with broader applicability.

The binary prediction
method, on the other hand, unlike the log
BB experiments depends on qualitative results. Such databases contain
very simple results pertaining to the success of a molecule in crossing
the BBB (Active = yes) or failure to do so (Active = no). Such databases
for blood–brain permeability were reported by various authors
and are easy to assemble. The key feature of these databases is that
they classify compounds into three classes, namely, active(yes), inactive(no),
and borderline(yes/no). Despite sounding simple, this particular type
of data set is not so, as it depends on the choice of scale or more
commonly the threshold of classification. For example, Cruciani et
al.19 denoted compounds as (i) BBB+ (permeable)
if log BB ≥ −0.3 and (ii) BBB– (non-permeable)
if log BB < −0.3; Li et al.20 on the other hand used ≥ −0.1 or < −0.1
as a reference point for dividing their data set; finally, Adenot
and Lahana21 classified their data set
based on the CNS activity. Several studies reported predictive models
for the so-called BBB± prediction with variable accuracy. These
models contain more than 60 molecular descriptors, at least. The first
attempt to reduce the number of descriptors was reported by Zhao et
al.22 by using 19 molecular descriptors
and several fragmentation schemes yielding an overall accuracy of
90%. The most useful descriptors for predicting BBB permeability,
as proposed by these reports, were polar surface area, number of hydrogen
bond donor and acceptor atoms, molecular weight, log P, log D, number of rotatable bonds, and molar volume.
The only descriptors related to solvation used in these models were
log P and accessible surface area. The process of
a permeation of a drug from plasma into the brain involves several
solvation–desolvation processes. We have thus decided to incorporate
solvation parameters as a descriptor in predicting BBB± via the
3D-RISM-KH molecular solvation theory. The other aim of this work
is to build on to a minimum-descriptor-based model for predicting
BBB± with high accuracy. The present work differs from our previous
work in two major points. First, the present work aims in correct
classification of blood–brain permeability and is not of interest
in calculating/predicting blood–brain permeability coefficients
as described in the previous work. Second, the predictive scheme used
here strives to remove the universal correction scheme from the modeling
scheme, as the need of corrected solvation energy is replaced with
the excess chemical potential and partial molar volume of solutes
in a specific solvent as direct descriptors for prediction.

The three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the
Kovalenko–Hirata closure (3D-RISM-KH) molecular solvation theory
is based on first-principles statistical mechanics. The essence of
this theory is based on the 3D distribution functions of solvent interaction
sites around the solute molecule of arbitrary shape.23−26 A detailed description of the theory is presented elsewhere.27−29 The 3D-RISM-KH theory describes a molecule using a six-dimensional
vector composed of three positional {r} and three
orientational {Θ} degrees of freedom in the molecular Ornstein–Zernike
equation, developing to the pair correlation functions (PCF) of r and Θ of liquids. The 3D distribution functions
of solvent interaction sites around a solute molecule of arbitrary
shape are obtained from the 3D-RISM integral equation. The 3D-RISM
integral equation has an exact differential of the solvation free
energy for the KH closure, which provides an analytical expression
of Kirkwood’s thermodynamic integration eventually providing
the chemical potential (both excess and total) associated with the
solvation process. The solvation free energy of the solute macromolecule
is obtained by summation of these 3D-solvation free energy density
partial contributions over all solvent sites in the whole space. Other
thermodynamic quantities can be derived from the solvation free energy
by differentiation, thus providing an option to decompose the contributions
from the entropy and enthalpy terms. Two significant advantages of
the 3D-RISM-KH theory are (i) the capability of providing distribution
of solvent molecules around a solute of arbitrary shapes with reasonable
accuracy and (ii) calculation of partial molar volume of a solute.
The latter property calculation is a leap forward from the traditional
way of calculating them as a sum of small molecular fragments of regular
geometry only. The major drawback of this theory is overestimation
of the solvation energy, and an efficient “universal correction”
scheme was developed and used for calculating correct solvation energy.16,30,31

Results and Discussion
The objectives of this manuscript are (i) to use the 3D-RISM-KH
molecular solvation theory calculated uncorrected solvation parameter,
the excess chemical potential in solvent, as descriptors in successful
prediction on the BBB± database as a proof of concept and (ii)
to develop a minimal-descriptor-based model for such prediction. To
this purpose, we have calculated molecular descriptors out of which
27 descriptors were selected via statistical importance analysis.
Other 10 descriptors generated via the 3D-RISM-KH calculations are
excess chemical potential and partial molar volumes in five different
solvents. These 37 descriptors (variables in the QSAR equation) were
subjected to further analysis in predicting permeability for BBB±.
The summary of these descriptors is provided in the Supporting Information. Further analysis of the importance
of these 27 variables in predicting permeability through the gradient
boosting machine (GBM) and random forest (RF) method filtered out
five and eight most important descriptors, respectively. These descriptors,
as shown in Figure 1, are topological polar surface area (TPSA), highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO), dipole moment, Lipinski H-bond acceptor count, Lipinski
H-bond donor count, excess chemical potential in the n-octanol solvent, partial molar volume of a solute in the n-octanol solvent, and excess chemical potential in the
cyclohexane solvent.

Figure 1 Summary of statistical analysis: (a) Important variables
selected
via random forest (green circle, eight descriptors) and gradient boost
machine (blue circle, five descriptors) algorithms; (b) variable importance
as calculated by the random forest algorithm; (c) relative importance
of variables predicted by the gradient boost machine method. The overlapping
zone of the two circles contains descriptors common to both of the
machine learning approaches. MeanDecreaseGini is the mean of a variable’s
total decrease in node impurity weighted by the proportion of samples
reaching that specific node in each individual decision tree in a
random-forest-based classification. The larger is this value, the
larger is the contribution of the corresponding descriptor.

For all statistical analysis methods for predicting
the importance
of variables, we have found that the TPSA32 was the most important descriptor followed by Lipinski’s
hydrogen bond donor/acceptor descriptors.33 The important electronic descriptors are HOMO computed at the AM1
level, as well as dipole moment. It is interesting to note that none
of the classification methods picked excess chemical potential in
water as an important descriptor. The most important solvation-energy-based
descriptors are excess chemical potentials in n-octanol
and cyclohexane media, the former being the major contributor. This
observation can be rationalized, as the nonpolar environment provided
by a membrane is better represented by n-octanol
and/or cyclohexane solvents, whereas the effect of water is taken
care of by the other 2D-descriptors pertaining to the polarity of
the molecule.

In order to find out the optimal number of descriptors
for correct
classification of the test set of compounds, we have tested a range
in minimum % relative importance of variables (6–12%) in the
gradient boost methods on a preliminary set of 37 descriptors. This
led us to different choices, further validated by the random forest
method, with different numbers of descriptors, for example, (i) model
A with 37 descriptors, (ii) model B with 11 descriptors combed using
the random forest method, (iii) model C with 11 descriptors obtained
from the GBM method, (iv) model D with eight descriptors obtained
via random forest analysis on models B and C, and (v) model E with
five descriptors obtained via GBM analysis on models B and C. A detailed
list of all the descriptors generated for predictive modeling is presented
in the Supporting Information. All these
models were first calibrated on the training set before accessing
their accuracy in classifying compounds in the test set correctly.

The performances of different models vary significantly based on
the method of classification adopted. For all the models, the SVM
(Support Vector Machine) predicted results are the best providing
an accuracy range of 94–99.0% based on the number of variables
chosen. The excellent prediction on the test set by SVM with Model
A can be attributed to fitting with a large number of descriptors.
However, the performance of this method remains excellent for other
models, too. The GBM and weighted k-nearest neighbor
(weighted kNN) techniques work with comparable and consistent accuracy
ranging 87–90% for different models. The generalized linear
model (GLM) method performed modestly among the four methods providing
the best accuracy of ∼84% but with the minimum descriptor model.
The accuracy of predictions of different models in classifying the
test set compounds as BB-permeable (yes/1) or BB-impermeable (no/0)
is summarized in Table 1.

indices are calculated as follows: Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN +
FP + FN). Precision = TP/(TP + FP). Sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN). Specificity
= TN/(TN + FP). F1-score = 2 × (precision × sensitivity)/(precision
+ sensitivity). TP = true positive, TN = true negative, FP = false
positive, FN = false negative.

It is necessary to compare the performance of the current generation
continuum solvation models, that is, CPCM and SMD, in predicting the
permeability. As mentioned in the Database Preparation and Computational
Methods section, we have employed the semiempirical AM1 method to
calculate solvation energy for the gas-phase optimized structures
in the continuum solvation models. The primary importance analysis
of the solvation energy parameters calculated via the CPCM and SMD
models in predicting permeability showed insignificant dependence
of calculated solvation energies in different solvents. However, we
performed a modeling exercise with solvation energy descriptors from
CPCM and SMD solvation models with other descriptors from model A.
The performance of this model is excellent as that of the RISM-KH
predictions in model A obtained via the SVM method. The performance
parameters of this model are summarized in Table 2.

Further, to answer the question that we do need the
3D-RISM-KH
based parameters for a successful classification model for BB permeability,
we re-evaluated the permeability by removing 3D-RISM-KH based descriptors
and keeping only the major 2D-molecular descriptor obtained from the
previous statistical analysis. These variables are (i) HOMO, (ii)
dipole moment, (iii) accessible surface area, (iv) Lipinski H-bond
donor count, (v) Lipinski H-bond acceptor count, (vi) log S, (vii) ring count, and (viii) TPSA. This resultant model
has a very decent performance, too, although with reduced performance
indices, as provided in Table 3. The information provided by log S and x4
descriptors can be related to the log P(octanol–water)
of the solutes, and it is tempting to build models with empirical
log P as one of the descriptors. We have built models
with log P as one of the descriptors within the minimal
descriptor approach although without much success (see the Supporting Information for the detailed description).

We have analyzed over 1800 molecules with reported
BBB± properties
using different statistical methods to assess the importance of over
100 different molecular descriptors in correctly classifying the permeability.
We have found that the 2D-descriptors like TPSA and H-bond donor/acceptors
are the most significant ones in the prediction schemes. The excess
chemical potentials of the solutes computed in n-octanol
and cyclohexane solvents were found to have an important contribution
in the classification scheme. This is the first report providing a
proof of concept that 3D-RISM-KH solvation theory based predictors
can be used successfully to predict the blood–brain barrier
permeability of drug (like) molecules in a binary fashion. The accuracy
of the predictive models has shown a logical dependence on the number
of descriptors used in model building. Thus, one can build a predictive
model with perfect classification performance, but requiring a large
number of molecular descriptors. One important aspect of this study
is in assembling a minimal-descriptor-based model with high accuracy,
sensitivity, and specificity. Among different models tested here,
the minimum descriptor model, with only five descriptors, bares testimony
to this. Few classification studies on blood–brain-barrier
permeability, with a limited number of data, used only the 2D-molecular
descriptor without incorporating solvation effects. Such models should
be used with caution as they are certain to have limitations based
on the class/type of chemical functionality used for calibration.
In our hand, the model without any solvation terms also provided very
reasonable accuracy although the specificity of this model is severely
reduced in comparison to other predictive models (Figure 2). The performances of different
statistical methods in correct classification vary significantly for
different models. The performance of the SVM method in correct classification
is found to be the best for all the models. The weighted kNN model
also performs well, albeit with reduced specificity. The GBM method
is one of the fastest computing methods, at par with the weighted
kNN method in performance. The GLM method performed significantly
worse than the previous three methods. Predictions based on this method
have lowest specificity and precision for our entire data set (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Performance indices of
different models used for classification.

It is important to point that it is easy to perform the entire
modeling exercise with the help of simple computer scripts and open
source software packages. The methodology developed here has wide
practical applicability. The training set (or, for example, the entire
data set) can be used for benchmark purposes for classifying new compounds.
It is reported in previous studies that the most difficult part in
this type of prediction is to correctly classify compounds with a
negative permeability class (impermeable, no/0). The SVM-based classification
method worked well in this regard, too. The correct prediction of
the BBB– compounds is ∼75% with model D and model E.
These models used the concept of minimal descriptors in predictive
blood–brain barrier permeability. We have tested models with
hydration excess chemical potential as an additional descriptor but
without any improvement in the prediction. The excess chemical potential
in n-octanol is the most important one among all
excess chemical potentials. Our findings have an extensive application
in predicting/classification of BB permeability using Gaussian fluctuation
excess chemical potentials obtained from the 3D-RISM-KH theory as
descriptors, without the need of an elaborate correction scheme to
obtain corrected solvation energy. The models proposed in the works
compare well with those reported in previous reports of a minimal-descriptor-based
prediction model.21,34 In fact, our models have reduced
the number of misclassifications over those previously reported despite
having a larger number of data points. Our finding that the SVM-based
machine learning approach works the best for blood–brain barrier
permeability classification supports the finding by Doniger et al.,34 albeit with a smaller data set used for calibration.
Finally, the best descriptor for classification schemes is a mixture
of 2D-, electronic, and solvation parameters. It is interesting to
point that TPSA was reported as the most important descriptor for
blood–brain permeability studies for almost all the previous
reports, as we report here. The hydrogen bond donor and acceptor are
important, too, as they empirically relate to the interactions with
the polar medium, like plasma. The excess chemical potentials in n-octanol and cyclohexane solvents are the best possible
descriptors to represent solvation energetics associated with a drug
actually transferring into a hydrophobic region. A combination of
these descriptors provides a balanced model toward correct classification
of the blood–brain permeability in the present study.

Database
Preparation and Computational Methods
The database of BBB±
compounds was collected from the published
works by Adenot and Lahana,21 Li et al.,20 and Doniger et al. and contains 1864 molecules.34 The SMILES code for all the molecules are provided
in the Supporting Information. The database
is divided into a training set (75% of molecules) and a test set (25%
of molecules) by randomly assigning the molecules.

Geometries
of all molecules were optimized at the semiempirical
AM1 level using the Gaussian16 software package.35,36 The protonation state of the molecules was retained for a pH of
7.2, and all calculations were done using ionic forms, wherever applicable.
Gas-phase optimized geometries were further subjected to solvation
energy calculations in chloroform, cyclohexane, n-hexadecane, n-octanol, and water continuum using
the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) and SMD continuum
model at the AM1 level, as implemented in the Gaussian16 software
package.37,38 All RISM-KH calculations (1D for solvent
susceptibility functions and 3D for solute excess chemical potential
calculations in solvents) were done using our in-house code. A working
version of this code is implemented in the AMBERTOOLS suite of programs.39 Five solvents, namely, chloroform, cyclohexane, n-hexadecane, n-octanol, and water, were
used for 1D-RISM susceptibility calculations. The parameters for these
solvents were validated against experimental solvation energy data
sets, as reported by us.16,31 We have employed UFF40 parameters with AM1 charges for all solutes.
The 3D-RISM-KH calculations were performed using a uniform cubic 3D
grid of 128 × 128 × 128 points in the box of size 64 ×
64 × 64 Å3 to represent a solute with a few solvation
layers with convergence accuracy set to 10–4 of
the modified direct inversion in the iterative subspace (MDIIS) solver.41 The molecular descriptors of all the molecules
were generated using the MOE2018 software package.42 All statistical analysis was performed using the Rstudio
version 3.4.4.43 Several R packages were
used to aid analysis and are briefly described in the following section.44−50

Support vector machines (SVM): SVM is a supervised learning
technique
branch of machine learning and applied to both classification and
regression problems. The superiority of the SVM model over conventional
neural networks is due to the structure risk management principle
adopted by it. There are several kernel functions available for SVM
to transform data into a dimension with clear division between classes.
We have tested linear kernel, Gaussian type radial basis kernel, ANOVA
radial basis kernel, and polynomial kernel types to find the best
kernel for our classification problem. The best solution was obtained
with the Gaussian type radial basis kernel.

Weighted k-nearest neighbor (kNN): kNN is a nonlinear
approach initiated with the choice of a set of variables, randomly,
to obtain the best solution. The optimization of selection is done
by leave-one-out cross validation where each point is removed and
predicted as an average of k-nearest points (i.e.,
molecules, for QSAR analysis). The weighted version of the kNN is
modified over the original implementation by adding weights to the
Euclidean distance of the nearest neighbors based on proximity.51

Gradient boost machine (GBM): This technique
is similar to random
forest, as an ensemble learner, for performing supervised machine
learning tasks.52 It differs from RF as
the loss function is minimized iteratively to find the best tree model.

Generalized linear model (GLM): This is an improved version over
ordinary least square regression for noncontinuous data with the assumptions
that the residuals are normally distributed and a linear relationship
exists between target and model parameters using a form of maximum
likelihood estimation.53

The performance
of different statistical methods adopted in this
manuscript is calculated via construction of a confusion matrix comparing
the reported permeability (1/0) against predicted permeability (1/0)
for each method and model. The confusion matrix consists of the most
important performance indicators as true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) counts. This information
is used to calculate accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and specificity
of each model and method using the following mathematical relations: 1   2   3   4  

Another performance index, the F1-score is also used for evaluation
purposes in this work.54 The F1-score is
a measure of accuracy of a model that combines the model’s
accuracy with sensitivity. A perfect model has an F1-score of 1, while
that for a failure is 0.
