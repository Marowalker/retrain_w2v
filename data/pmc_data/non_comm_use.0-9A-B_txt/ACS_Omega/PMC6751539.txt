We
report a series of ferrocene-based derivatives and their corresponding
oxidized forms in which the introduction of simple electron donating
groups like methyl or tert-butyl units on cyclopentadienyl-rings
afford great tunability of Fe+III/Fe+II redox
potentials from +0.403 V down to −0.096 V versus saturated
calomel electrode. The spin forbidden d–d transitions of ferrocene
derivatives shift slightly toward the blue region with an increasing
number of electron-donating groups on the cyclopentadienyl-rings with
very little change in absorptivity values, whereas the ligand-to-metal
transitions of the corresponding ferricinium salts move significantly
to the near-IR region. The electron-donating groups also contribute
in the strengthening of electron density of Fe+III d-orbitals,
which therefore improves the chemical stability against the oxygen
reaction. Further, density functional theory calculations show a reducing
trend in outer shell reorganization energy with an increasing number
of the electron donating units.

Introduction
Ferrocene is a well-known
organometallic redox mediator, which
has a number of applications in almost all fields related to electrochemistry.1 The sandwich structure of ferrocene is based
on two negatively charged aromatic cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings which
creates a stable 18-electron system for Fe(+II) ions.2 It confers to the complex a high temperature robustness
up to 400 °C in air,1a,3 a reversible electrochemical
characteristic at a redox potential of +0.403 V [vs saturated calomel
electrode (SCE)] for which this latter is independent of the solvent
properties, and good solubility in most of the common organic solvents.
However, ferrocene is predisposed to various electrophilic attacks
because of the electron-rich aromatic Cp-rings.1a,4 Taking
this as an advantage, it can thus serve as a potential precursor for
synthesizing a variety of derivatives to finely reach the targeted
asset. Ferrocene is also being used in the design of novel ligand
architectures for the synthesis of various metal catalysts,5 suitable redox couples in mixed valence states,6,7 redox shuttles in catalysis,8 and for
the development of electrochemically active dendrons, dendrimers,
and polymers.1a,9−11 Ferrocene can
be used as part of a battery electrode material12 and has been proposed as a fast redox mediator in dye-sensitized
solar cells to decrease energy losses related to the dye regeneration
step.13

This paper reports a complete
study on the characterization and
density functional theory (DFT) calculations of four differently modified
ferrocenes by means of the introduction of methyl and tertiary-butyl
units to the Cp-rings. This study provides an insight, how and to
which extent the characteristics of ferrocene can be controlled or
tuned with the introduction of a simple electron donating unit to
the Cp-rings. The increased electron density on the Cp-rings further
influences the overall electrochemical and optical properties of the
whole molecule. The consequences in terms of electrochemistry, stability,
optical and magnetic properties are herein discussed.

Results and Discussion
The electrochemical properties of all the ferrocene derivatives
were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). All the Fe+III/Fe+II redox potentials
and their electrochemical reversibility were also investigated taking
ferrocene as the standard.4b,4c The voltammograms recorded
for the different ferrocene molecules in acetonitrile are shown in Figure 1. The Fe+III/Fe+II redox potential for Me10Fc+/Me10Fc was observed at −0.096 V (vs SCE) compared
to standard Fc+/Fc at 0.403 V (vs SCE) without affecting
electrochemical reversibility. The increasing number of methyl groups
on the Cp-rings gradually decreases the redox potential by ca. 100
mV (one methyl group per one Cp ring), that is, +0.302 V (vs SCE)
for Me2Fc+/Me2Fc and +0.003 V for
Me8Fc+/Me8Fc. We found a linear relationship
between the redox potential of the complex and the Hammett constant
(σp) of the substituent and its total number according
to the equation E1/2 (vs SCE) = 0.403
+ 0.291σp (Figure S1).
The synthesis of Me4Fc and Me6Fc still revealed
to be challenging despite our efforts. Indeed, the corresponding Cp
ring with two and three methyl groups (σp = 0.17)
are found to be highly unstable and forms structural isomers during
synthesis. These structural isomers revealed afterward to be rather
difficult to separate also. Other synthetic routes involving the multistep
methylation of a suitable ferrocene derivative (e.g., Fc or Me2Fc) also resulted in a mixture of isomers with very low yields.
As an alternative to these two complexes, we proposed the introduction
of two tert-butyl units which has a similar Hammett
constant (σp = 0.16) on each Cp ring, which affords
lowering of the redox potential to +0.170 V (vs SCE) while keeping
excellent electrochemical reversibility. This complex has been proposed
by Bläser et al. and then by Gleiter et al.18 This potential value lies exactly between Me2Fc+/Me2Fc and Me8Fc+/Me8Fc filling the gap with an identical synthetic procedure (Figures 1 and 2). The result is in good agreement with predicting the energetic
destabilization of the iron d-orbitals within the crystal field with
the increasing electron density on the Cp-rings by methyl or tert-butyl (tBu) groups. The
greater effect of the tert-butyl group is due to
its stronger inductive effect (σi = 0.07 vs 0.04
for CH3).19 The diffusion coefficients
of these different ferrocene molecules have been determined by cyclic
voltamperometry with different scan rates (Figures 2 and S2–S7). This parameter is particularly important for electrochemical applications
in which the mass transport limitation can control the overall cell
kinetic such as in dye-sensitized solar cells,13c molecular redox shuttle for batteries,20 or as an electroactive component in redox flow batteries.21 Randles–Sevcik equation has been utilized
after verifying (i) the linear relationship between the peak currents
(both anodic and cathodic) as a function of the square root of scan
rate, and (ii) that the system remains rapid and reversible in the
whole domain of scan rates. The obtained values of diffusion coefficients
for the different complexes are reported in Table 1. Although the introduction of the methyl
or tert-butyl group(s) onto the Cp ring will lead
to a slightly more bulky complex, which can penalize its diffusion
capacity into confined mesoporosity, it is however noteworthy to see
a beneficial effect on the diffusion property in acetonitrile likely
as a result of the increased electron density redistribution between
two Cp-rings which may have improved the ion pairing interactions
between ferrocene and PF6– (TBAPF6 used as a supporting electrolyte) in the electrolyte solution.
Twofold enhancement in the experimental diffusion coefficient value
(from DFc = 2.60 × 10–9 m2/s for ferrocene, a value in good agreement with the
literature,22 to DMe2Fc = 5.73 × 10–9 m2/s for the dimethyl ferrocene counterpart) also suggests that
there is a better ion pair interaction despite being heavier. More
methyl groups result in a greater diffusion coefficient value, reaching
as high as DMe10Fc+ = 7.87 × 10–9 m2/s and DtBuFc+ = 4.99 × 10–9 m2/s for the deca-methyl
and tert-butyl counterparts, respectively. There
are no noticeable differences on the diffusion coefficient between
the ferrocene and oxidized ferricinium·TFSI derivatives except
for the deca-methyl ferrocene complex regardless of the metal centers
being at different oxidation states. The Fe+III/Fe+II redox potential values for both oxidized and reduced ferrocene
molecules are almost identical. There is a slight downward shift of
the whole voltamperogram compared to the parental reduced form without
any significant difference in peak current or Faradaic current values
(Figure 3). This downward
shift was also noticed while CVs were being recorded after each successive
addition of AgTFSI to the electrochemical cell in order to confirm
that it is not because of any impurity (Figure S8). The reason for this downward shift of voltamperogram for
oxidized forms is not very clear at the moment and needs further investigation.

Chemical and electrochemical
stabilities of these complexes are
other aspects while considering them to be applicable. Pure ferricinium
salt is stable in the solid-state when air is excluded. However, ferricinium
salt in the solution becomes unstable in de-aerated aqueous solution
when the pH is lower than 4 or in de-aerated aprotic solvents. The
rapid decomposition of ferrocene occurs at a pH greater than 4 or
in non-aqueous solvents which can act as proton acceptors.23 The ferricinium salt reacts with molecular oxygen
in polar solvents such as acetonitrile, leading to a reactive μ-peroxy
iron radical intermediate which again reacts with ferricinium salt
further resulting in a μ-peroxy di-iron complex.24 This reactivity toward oxygen is also a function
of the type of counter ions and atmosphere of cycling.25 To better assess the electrochemical stability
of the different complexes in pure acetonitrile under ambient conditions, Figures 4 and 5 report the cyclic voltamperograms for ferrocene and the modified
complexes including either different methyl units or tert-butyl groups over 100 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. Figure 4a shows
that a gradual loss in peak currents and deteriorating shape of original
CVs for Fc and Me2Fc while carrying out successive oxidation/reduction
cycles under ambient conditions, indicating instability of oxidized
forms in solution due to a reaction with oxygen in a facile manner
as described elsewhere. This is favorable to an irreversible steady-state
current in oxidation and reduction, which is maintained over cycles
with a large overpotential greater than 500 mV. This result highlights
the rapid and continuous decomposition of electrochemically formed
ferricinium after the very few first cycles. In the case of Me2Fc, a similar decomposition of the complex is experienced
(Figure 4b). However,
this decomposition leads to the occurrence of an irreversible anodic
faradaic peak at 0.92 V (vs SCE) and a broad steady-state cathodic
current starting at −0.35 V (vs SCE) with similar features
as Fc+ except the onset, which is at a potential 200 mV
greater compared to Fc+. Interestingly, the introduction
of more than one methyl or tert-butyl unit per Cp
ring affords to greatly enhance electrochemical stability of the corresponding
oxidized forms as reported in Figure 5a–f, showing a perfectly reversible fingerprint
without any fading of peak currents upon cycling. This result suggests
that the formation of the μ-peroxo iron radicals could have
been hampered by strengthening the electron density to Fe+III orbitals. The electrochemical signature and stability are similar
regardless if we start by the ferrocene derivatives or the corresponding
ferricinium salts obtained from chemical oxidation using AgTFSI.

The inner shell reorganization energies of the different Fc derivatives
have been calculated from the fundamental definition, that is, the
energy required to bring the oxidized state at the equilibrium geometry
from the reduced state. This parameter is particularly important in
photocatalysis and in dye-sensitized solar cells for instance because
the energy requisite to undergo the “red-to-ox” reaction
results in an internal energy loss of the system. In this case, the
molecular geometry is first optimized for the cation (C) state and
the energy Ecat(C) is computed, then the
geometry is optimized for the neutral state, one electron is removed,
and the electronic energy Ecat(N) of the
cation state is computed. The reorganization energy is then defined
as λin = Ecat(N) – Ecat(C). In order to verify the accuracy and
reliability of the results, the reorganization energies of Fc, Me2Fc, and Me8Fc have also been computed using the
expression , valid
in the harmonic approximation of
the potential energy surfaces (values reported into bracket in Table 2). Here, ωn stands for the frequencies of the normal
modes of the molecule vibration and dn for their dimensionless displacements upon oxidation/reduction.
The results, reported in Table 2, show excellent agreement between the two approaches confirming
the reliability of the calculations. In all the cases, one interesting
feature of ferrocene is the niche in their very low reorganization
energies which are in the order of a few tenths of meV, in agreement
with previous studies on ferrocene.26 Such
a small reorganization energy is associated with minor variations
of the molecular geometry upon oxidation and reduction, in contrast
to polypyridyl cobalt complexes for instance used in dye-sensitized
solar cells which require more than 200 meV of reorganization energy.27 The introduction of methyl or tert-butyl units on Cp-rings induces only a slight increase of the reorganization
energy from 16 meV for Fc to 46 meV for tBu4Fc.

a Values in parenthesis are obtained
within the harmonic approximation. The outer shell reorganization
energy is computed in acetonitrile using a two-zone heterogeneous
electron-transfer model.

In addition, outer shell reorganization energy λo for electrode reactions have been computed considering a two-zone
heterogeneous electron-transfer model28  where ϵop and ϵst are the optical
and static dielectric constants of the solvent, a is the cavity radius of the redox species, and 2d is the distance between the redox species and its image
in the metal electrode, that is twice the distance d of the redox species from the surface of the electrode. The effective
radius a of the cavity of the redox species is obtained
by using an effective value of a sphere with the same volume of the
cavity obtained from the tessellation of molecular surfaces. This
distance d is usually assumed to coincide with the
position of the outer Helmholtz plane. This latter can be estimated
as the sum of the diameter of the solvent molecule (Dsolv) and the radius of the solvated ions (Rion). The parameters used in our calculations are tabulated
in Table 3.29 In contrast to the inner reorganization energy,
the introduction of methyl or tert-butyl groups on
Cp-rings leads to a decrease of the outer-sphere reorganization energy
from 780 meV for Fc to 498 meV for tBu4Fc suggesting that the modification of the pentadiene units
with methyl or tert-butyl units affords reducing
the energy of the first solvation shell.

Absorption Spectra and
Kinetic Study
The UV–visible
absorption spectra of all ferrocene and ferricinium derivatives in
acetonitrile are shown in Figure 6. Ferrocene exhibits two distinct absorption bands,
at 322 nm with a very low molar extinction coefficient (ε) of
61 L mol–1 cm–1 and at 442 nm
giving the typical orange color of the complex with ε = 95 L
mol–1 cm–1. The optical absorption
spectrum of the ferricinium counterpart has not been determined because
of fast decomposition in the solution under ambient conditions. A
stronger and broad absorption band deeper in UV is also visible with
a maximum at 205 nm (ε ≈ 50 000 L mol–1 cm–1). This latter corresponds to an allowed π–π*
transition in the Cp-rings because of its high oscillator strength
(f ≈ 0.77) in analogy with the absorption
fingerprint of benzene molecules.30 It
has also some ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) characters in
the red part of this band, explaining its broadness and the molar
extinction coefficient dropping in the range of 8000 L mol–1 cm–1.31 The origin
of the electronic transitions at 332 nm is still not clear from the
literature.32b−32d Indeed, it seems that the origin is not
entirely a symmetry-forbidden d–d transition which occurred
because of the vibrational distortion of the molecular symmetry as
one could expect.32e Indeed, Becker et
al. reported that the position of this band is independent of temperature,
whereas sharpening and shifting of the band maximum with a decrease
in temperature would be expected in this case.30b Our results show a red-shift and intensity increase of
this band by the introduction of one methyl or two tert-butyl units in each cyclopentadienyl ring. The introduction of further
methyl units leads even to a disappearance of this band or becoming
curtained off by the broadening and red-shifting of the π–π*
transition of Cp-rings and LMCT contribution. Consequently, this gives
the credit that molecular orbitals of the rings are involved in this
electronic transition at 322 nm, in agreement with Becker et al.30b This transition is thus assigned either to
a n−π* type symmetry-allowed transition of the type 3d-MO*
or alternatively to a symmetry-forbidden π–π* transition.
The band situated in the visible range at 442 nm is assigned to a
forbidden d–d transition localized on the iron metal center.
It is only slightly affected by the substitution on the cyclopentadienyl
rings. Indeed, all ferrocene derivatives have λmax at a very similar region between 442 and 423 nm, except for tBu4Fc which has λmax at 462 nm. The introduction of methyl groups in the Cp core shifts
therefore this optical transition to blue, signifying symmetry modification
by the substitution with more localized d–d transitions on
iron. The molar extinction coefficients for all the ferrocene derivatives
are comparatively identical (ε ≈ 96 L mol–1 cm–1) except for tBu4Fc which has a slightly higher molar extinction coefficient
(ε ≈ 105 L mol–1 cm–1). Considering the low molar extinction coefficient which is due
to the spin forbidden d–d transition, all these ferrocene derivatives
absorb a very negligible amount of light in the visible region.

absorption spectra of the different (a) ferrocene
and derivatives and (b) ferricinium derivatives in acetonitrile at
a concentration of 2 mmol/L.

Regardless of the derivatives, the chemical oxidation by AgTFSI
leads to a color modification of the solution turning green, which
translates into a drastic modification in the absorption spectra as
shown in Figure 6b.
All the oxidized forms absorb part in blue up to ca. 550 nm and a stronger band for
which the maximum varies more noticeably in energy from 647 nm for
[Me2Fc][TFSI] to 778 nm for [Me10Fc][TFSI].
The molar extinction coefficient is also enhanced by the substitution
in the Cp-rings, for example, from 97 L mol–1 cm–1 for [Me2Fc][TFSI] to 488 L mol–1 cm–1 [Me10Fc][TFSI]. This band is ascribed
to an allowed LMCT transition (2E1u ← 2E2g) in agreement with the literature.32b−32f The reason this band is more sensitive to substitution when in the
ferricinium oxidation state is explained on the basis of the d5-Fe(III) electron configuration which leads to a more compact
metal-to-ligand bonding and extended electron delocalization between
the metal center and Cp-rings. The substitution in the cyclopentadienyl
ring with a number of electron-donating groups, enhances the electron
density in the ligand.

The chemical oxidation process for all
the ferrocene derivatives
was also monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy (see Figures S9–S11) with successive addition
of AgTFSI. The UV–vis absorption experiment suggested a very
slow oxidation process occurred for Fc → Fc+ with
AgTFSI and probably Fc being decomposed as soon as it is getting oxidized
as stated elsewhere. While adding the successive amount of AgTFSI
to the Me2Fc solution in acetonitrile, it shows slow oxidation
of Me2Fc and gradual decomposition indicated by the color
change from green to brown. For ferrocene, the oxidation reaction
competes with the ferricinium decomposition. This is also the case
for Me2Fc to a lower extent for which the absorption value
at 653 nm decreases gradually over a few hours because of the possible
decomposition of Me2Fc·TFSI in acetonitrile (Figure 7). The chemical oxidation
for tBu4Fc, Me8Fc,
and Me10Fc is almost instantaneous. The stability of the
Fc+ form has been investigated by monitoring in situ the
modification of the UV–visible absorption spectrum over a period
of 10 h (Figure S12). For this, the absorption
value at the highest absorption peak was monitored at intervals of
5 min. The oxidized forms of tBu4Fc, Me8Fc, and Me10Fc show no noticeable change
over 10 h demonstrating the higher stability against the oxygen reaction
in good agreement with the improved reversibility in electrochemistry
upon cycling (Figure 7).

absorption band maximum as a function of time is reported in the inset.

Magnetic Properties
The room-temperature
M(H) hysteresis
loops of Fc, Me2Fc, tBu4Fc, Me8Fc, and Me10Fc ferrocene derivatives
are shown in Figure 8. Figures S13–S15 show an example
of the hysteresis loop measured at 20 K. A negative slope is measured
for all ferrocene derivatives indicating a diamagnetic behavior and
the absence of unpaired electrons. The absence of unpaired electrons
is in agreement with the six electrons occupying the t2g levels of the d-orbitals in Fe+II ions. As expected,
the ferricinium derivatives exhibit a different magnetic behavior
within the whole range of temperature from 300 K down to 20 K (Figure 8b–d). The
linear and slight hysteresis loop is the signature of a paramagnetic
behavior induced by the one unpaired electron of the Fe+III metal center. In order to extract quantitative information, magnetic
susceptibilities of the three oxidized compounds were estimated from
the slope of the M(H) hysteresis loops. The susceptibilities were
also corrected for the overall diamagnetism of the investigated oxidized
substances with an approximation given by χD = −MW/2
× 10–6 emu g–1; MW denotes
the molecular weight of the molecule.33 The temperature dependence of the susceptibilities is linear with
a Curie–Weiss behavior (χ = C/(T – θ)) without any hint of a magnetic phase
transition. Figure 7 shows χ–1 and the extrapolation to T = 0 K of χ–1 gives positive values
to θ reminiscent of ferromagnetic interactions between the spins
(see Figures S13–S15). Effective
magnetic moments were also deduced for the three oxidized derivatives
μeff = 2.823(χ × T)1/2; see Miller et al. and Gray et al. for a discussion on
magnetic properties and ordering in ferrocene-based complexes.32 The expected moment value for a single spin
is 1.73 μB. A deviation is observed for the obtained
values in agreement with previous investigations on closely related
molecules (Figure 8b).34 Indeed, the obtained values depend
on temperature and are in the range of 2.15–2.25 μB for tBu4Fc·TFSI
and 1.95–2.20 μB for Me8Fc·TFSI
and Me10Fc·TFSI, respectively. According to Miller
et al. and Reiners et al. deviation to the spin only value and temperature
dependence of the effective magnetic moment is attributed to electronic
excitations to higher levels, spin–orbit coupling and lower
symmetry (Figure 9).32,34

Conclusions
A series of ferrocene-based
compounds and their corresponding oxidized
derivatives were synthesized and characterized by optical, electrochemical,
and magnetic means. The introduction of electron-donating groups on
the Cp-rings affords to lower the redox potential to a greater extent
from +0.403 V for Fc+/Fc down to −0.096 V (vs SCE)
for Me10Fc+/Me10Fc without drastically
increasing the reorganization energy between -red and -ox forms, remaining
well below 50 meV showing high structural robustness upon electron
transfer. This modification offers a substantial enhancement in the
chemical/electrochemical stability of the oxidized forms in acetonitrile
under ambient conditions. The introduction of methyl or tert-butyl groups on Cp-rings hampers the complex decomposition against
oxygen reaction. Finally, our results show that the chemical modification
of the Cp-ring leads to a slight blue-shift of the main absorption
band for the reduced forms related to the spin forbidden d–d
transition. However, a significant red-shift and molar extinction
coefficient enhancement occurred for the oxidized forms related to
the LMCT band.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and were of reagent grade except for dried tetrahydrofuran (THF) which
was at 99.9% purity. Ferrocene (Fc) and 1,1′-dimethylferrocene
(Me2Fc) were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Bis(η5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)iron(II) (Me10Fc)
was purchased from Acros Organics. AgTFSI, 2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene,
1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene,1,3-ditertiarybutylcyclopetadiene,
1.9 mol/L t-BuLi in pentane, and 3 mol/L n-BuLi solution in hexane were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 1H, and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
400 MHz ADVANCE III HD spectrometer at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively.
When necessary, assignments of 1H and 13C signals
were performed using correlation spectroscopy and heteronuclear single
quantum correlation. High-resolution electrospray mass spectra (HRMS)
in the positive ion mode were obtained on a Q-Tof Ultima Global hybrid
quadrupole/time-of-flight instrument.

Synthesis of Me8Fc
2.47 mL (2 g, 16.35 mmol)
of 2,3,4,5-tetra methylcyclopentadienyl was taken in 20 mL THF under
Ar and at 0 °C. 10 mL (18 mmol) of n-BuLi (1.9
mol/L in pentane) was slowly added to the reaction mixture over a
period of 30 min in agreement with the literature.14 A white slurry was obtained at the end of n-BuLi addition. The reaction was further allowed to stir for another
30 min. 1.28 g (7.89 mmol) of FeCl2 was then added to this
slurry followed by gentle heating of the reaction mixture to room
temperature (20 °C). The stirring was continued for another 1
h at room temperature under Ar. The reaction mixture was then quenched
by the dropwise addition of ice-cold water. Once quenched, 50 mL of
extra water was added. THF was evaporated by a rotary evaporator followed
by the solvent extraction of the aqueous reaction mixture with hexane
(100 mL × 3). The organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and a yellow-color product was collected by evaporating the solvent
with a yield of 1.9 g (6.37 mmol, 81%).

Synthesis of tBu4Fc
tBu4Fc was synthesized following
rigorously the same synthetic procedure as for Me8Fc in
agreement with the literature.14 2 mL (1.67
g, 9.37 mmol) of bis(tertiarybutyl)cyclopentadienyl, 3.70 mL (9.37
mmol) of n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexane), and 593.19 mg
of FeCl2 were taken for the reaction. Yield: 3 g (7.49
mmol, 80%).

Synthesis and Structural Characterization
of Fc, Me2Fc, Me8Fc, Me10Fc, and tBu4Fc
Fc, Me2Fc and Me10Fc are commercially available. Me8Fc and tBu4Fc were synthesized.
Each ferrocene
derivative was fully characterized by their melting points, NMR and
high-resolution mass spectrometry and results are gathered in ESI
materials.

Oxidation Procedure for [Me2Fc][TFSI],
[tBu4Fc][TFSI], [Me8Fc][TFSI],
and [Me10Fc][TFSI]
200 mg of each ferrocene derivatives
were reacted with one equivalent of AgTFSI (silver trifluorosulfone-imide)
in 20 mL of acetone under ambient conditions.13b,15 The reaction mixture turned instantly from yellow to green. However,
chemical oxidation was maintained under stirring for another 30 min
at RT. The reaction mixture was then filtered through a 1 in. silica
pad in order to remove the Ag particles. The crude product was collected
by evaporating the solvent. The latter was further washed with hexane
(10 mL × 3) to remove any unreacted ferrocene derivatives. Finally,
the desired pure oxidized product was collected and dried.

Electrochemistry
All electrochemical experiments were
performed using a potentiostat/galvanostat VMP3 (BioLogic Science
Instruments). 100 mmol/L of TBAPF6 was used as a supporting
electrolyte and acetonitrile as a solvent. A 3 mm diameter glassy
carbon electrode (CHI instrument) was used as a working electrode,
a platinum wire as a counter electrode and a SCE as a reference electrode.
All electrochemical experiments were systematically carried out using
2 mM solution the desired compound.

Absorption Spectroscopy
and Kinetic Study
The UV–visible
absorption spectra were recorded using an Agilent Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer in acetonitrile. Spectra were recorded in the range
of 300–850 nm for the kinetic study over a period of 10 h with
intervals of 5 min.

Magnetic Properties
The magnetic
properties were investigated
using a Cryogen Free Quantum Design system equipped with a vibrating
sample magnetometer. M(H) hysteresis loops were measured under a field
of up to 1 T and from 300 K down to 20 K.

Computational Details
Equilibrium geometries of all
molecules in their neutral and cationic states have been optimized
using DFT with the B3PW91 hybrid functional and an Ahlrichs’
def2-TZVP full electron basis for all atoms including the iron center.
This combination of the functional and basis set has already proven
to give reliable estimates of geometry parameters for metallocenes.16 Normal modes of vibration of Fc, Me2Fc, and Me8Fc have been computed at the same level of
theory. The displacement of normal modes dn have been obtained by projecting the Cartesian displacements
onto the direction of normal modes by the relation17  where ω is the diagonal matrix of the
vibrational wavenumbers in γ = 2πωc/ℏ, L is the rectangular
matrix of normal modes of the neutral state expressed as linear combinations
of Cartesian displacements, and xN/C0 are the equilibrium coordinates
of the molecules in their neutral and cation states, respectively.
