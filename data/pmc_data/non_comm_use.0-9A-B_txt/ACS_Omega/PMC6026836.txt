Protegrin-1
(PG-1) is a cationic arginine-rich antimicrobial peptide.
It is widely accepted that PG-1 induces membrane disruption by forming
pores that lead to cell death. However, the insertion mechanism for
these highly cationic peptides into the hydrophobic membrane environment
is still poorly understood at the molecular scale. It has previously
been determined that the association of arginine guanidinium and lipid
phosphate groups results in strong bidentate bonds that stabilize
peptide–lipid complexes. It has also been suggested that arginine
residues are able to drag phosphate groups as they insert inside the
membrane to form a toroidal pore. However, whether bidentate bonds
play a significant role in inducing a pore formation remains unclear.
To investigate the role of bidentate complexes in PG-1 translocation,
we conducted molecular dynamics simulations. Two computational electroporation
methods were implemented to examine the translocation process. We
found that PG-1 could insert into the membrane, provided the external
electric potential is large enough to first induce a water column
or a pore within the lipid bilayer membrane. We also found that the
highly charged PG-1 is capable in itself of inducing molecular electroporation.
Substitution of arginines with charge-equivalent lysines showed a
markedly reduced tendency for insertion. This indicates that the guanidinium
group likely facilitates PG-1 translocation. Potential of mean force
calculations suggests that peptide insertion inside the hydrophobic
environment of the membrane core is not favored. We found that formation
of a water column or a pore might be a prerequisite for PG-1 translocation.
We also found that PG-1 can stabilize the pore after insertion. We
suggest that PG-1 could be a pore inducer and stabilizer. This work
sheds some light on PG-1 translocation mechanisms at the molecular
level. Methods presented in this study may be extended to other arginine-rich
antimicrobial and cell-penetrating peptides.

1 Introduction
Antimicrobial peptides
(AMPs) are attracting widespread interest
as an alternative to traditional antibiotic treatments and a potential
solution for the emergence of resistance to antibiotics.1,2 There are over 2000 AMPs discovered in nature and documented in
publicly available databases.3−5 Protegrin-1 (PG-1 RGGRLCYCRRRFCVCVGR-NH2) is a remarkably potent, naturally occurring cationic AMP,
which has 18 amino acid residues and forms a β-hairpin structure
(Figure 1). PG-1 was
first isolated from porcine leukocytes.6 It has two intramolecular disulfide bonds and is rich in arginine
(Arg). The atomic structure of PG-1 was determined from NMR experiments,
in monomeric and dimeric forms and then in octameric pores inside
lipid bilayers.7−9

Figure 1 Structure of PG-1. The arrows represent a β-hairpin
structure
pointing from the N-terminal to the C-terminal. Arg side chains are
in magenta. Disulfide bonds are in yellow.

The antimicrobial mechanism of PG-1 is proposed to be based
on
pore formation. It is believed that PG-1 binds onto membranes and
inserts inside the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayer membranes, where
it oligomerizes. Oligomers of PG-1 form pores, through which there
is fast, uncontrollable ion transport. The transmembrane (TM) potential
collapses rapidly because of this transport, and the ensuing osmotic
lysis results in quick bacterial death.10−12

There is a plethora
of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations conducted
to investigate the mechanism of action of PG-1.10−16 The majority of previous studies focused on certain stages of the
pore formation process, such as early membrane surface binding and
dimerization, or on the final pore structure. However, the process
of PG-1 membrane translocation remains enigmatic from a molecular
point of view because PG-1 has a +7 net charge at physiological pH
and is thus not expected to interact favorably with the hydrophobic
core of a lipid bilayer.

In the experiment, the 13C–31P distances
for PG-1 in the lipid membrane were found to be very short, which
suggested the formation of bidentate complexes between guanidinium
and lipid phosphate groups (see Figure 2).17−20 This complex is also commonly found in other Arg-rich AMPs and cell-penetrating
peptides (CPPs).21 Therefore, it was suggested
that the cationic Arg residues could drag the anionic phosphate groups
as they insert into the hydrophobic part of the membrane, thereby
facilitating a toroidal pore formation.17 However, it is still uncertain whether the association energy of
a bidentate complex suffices to overcome the energy barrier for membrane
insertion. In addition, toroidal pores have also been found in peptide-free
systems.22,23 The presence of a bidentate complex might
not then be necessary or sufficient for pore formation. Nevertheless,
the experimental distance measurements showed only a result in the
octameric pore state. To better understand the membrane insertion
mechanism, intermediate structures and interactions must be investigated.21

Figure 2 Schematic of the structure formed between the guanidinium
and phosphate
groups through combined electrostatic forces and bidentate hydrogen
bonding.

There are a host of studies focusing
on the translocation of peptides
across the membrane. Fuertes et al.24 suggested
that membrane-active peptides can serve as inducers and stabilizers
of pores, the formation of which may also be induced by mechanical
or electrical tensions. Sun et al.25 studied
the Arg-rich CPPs of octa-arginine peptides. They applied external
tension on the lipids to induce a pore for peptide translocation.
They concluded that octa-arginine peptides can slow down the kinetic
rate for pore closure of naturally occurring pores. Miteva et al.26 studied NK-lysin associated to a membrane and
proposed that, provided the peptide is sufficiently charged, the bound
peptides on the membrane suffice to trigger electroporation.

Herein, we describe a series of MD simulations performed using
different techniques. The adsorption of PG-1 on the membrane surface
was simulated to confirm the presence of bidentate complexes. In addition,
electroporation simulations were conducted to study the translocation
process. This protocol has been applied before to study pore formation
and transport of small molecules.27−29 Potential of mean force
(PMF) calculations were finally conducted to examine the effect of
bidentate complexes on the insertion energy barrier.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Binding of PG-1 onto the
POPE/POPG Bilayers
To investigate the interactions in the
PG-1_POPE:POPG system, we
performed three independent MD simulations (Sim 1, Sim 2, and Sim
3) by placing PG-1 2.0 nm above the bilayer surface initially. The
simulations were carried out for 50 ns. Figure 3 illustrates the time trajectory of the center-of-mass
distance between PG-1 and the average position of phosphorus atoms
on the top leaflet. It can be observed that PG-1 rapidly binds onto
the membrane surface in all simulations.

Figure 3 Distance along the membrane
normal (z-axis) between
the PG-1 center of mass and the average location of phosphorus atoms
in the upper leaflet. Distance calculations are performed using all
three sets of simulations for the PG-1 and POPE/POPG system.

Representative snapshots for Sim
2 are provided in Figure 4. During the simulations, PG-1
freely diffuses in the water subphase. We observed that the binding
process has several stages. In the beginning (0–5 ns), PG-1
rotates its axis and moves toward the lipids rapidly. It interacts
with the bilayer with either the two-terminal side or the β-turn
side. Both sides include a cluster of Arg residues, which indicates
that the positively charged residues are essential for the initial
contact through electrostatic interactions. In the next stage (5–20
ns), the remaining part of the molecule fluctuates in water until
additional Arg residues interact with the lipids. In the last stage
(20–50 ns), PG-1 has barely any conformational change and inserts
fully into the lipid head groups.

POPE/POPG simulation.
The Arg residues are represented in sticks. The phosphorus atoms of
POPE and POPG lipids are colored in gray and in purple, respectively.
Phosphorus atoms within 0.3 nm are highlighted with orange color and
their lipid tails are shown in sticks.

In line with the aforementioned results, the lipid contact
ratio
presented in Figure 5 provides clear evidence that Arg residues on both sides of the β-hairpin
have the largest number of atoms in contact with the lipids. The average
lipid contact is defined as the number of nonhydrogen PG-1 atoms within
0.3 nm of lipids divided by the total number of nonhydrogen atoms.
It is noticed that the N-terminal Arg residue has the highest contact.
This might be due to the longer length of the N-terminal side compared
to the C-terminal side (see Figure 1), which allows the N-terminal Arg residue to insert
more deeply into the bilayer.

Figure 5 Lipid contact ratio of each PG-1 residue in
the simulation. This
ratio is defined as the number of nonhydrogen PG-1 atoms within 0.3
nm of POPE or POPG lipids divided by the total number of nonhydrogen
atoms for each residue. Results are averaged over the last 20 ns of
all simulations.

To further examine peptide–lipid
interactions, Figure 6 presents the H-bonds
formed between Arg residues and lipids. For the three simulations,
the mean value of H-bonds in the last 20 ns is approximately 12. On
average, each Arg residue forms two H-bonds through the bidentate
hydrogen bonding (see Figure 2).

Results are averaged for all three simulations.

2.2 MD Simulations with TM Potential
Membrane transport of small nonpolar molecules is relatively favorable
because of the hydrophobic environment of the lipids. This process
is well-described by the solubility–diffusion mechanism.30 On the contrary, for hydrophilic molecules and
ions, it appears that the formation of a water column or a pore (we
use these two terms for contiguous water structures that span the
lipid bilayer) can facilitate lipid flip-flop and subsequent transport
of polar molecules.31 However, in conventional
equilibrium MD simulations, it is challenging to observe pore formation
because of the very long simulation time needed. There have been some
studies where pore formation was observed, but these studies utilized
relatively old force fields found to underestimate the free energy
barrier for lipid flip-flop across the membrane.32−34 More recent
atomistic simulations using CHARMM36 force fields estimate a much
larger energy cost for lipid flip-flop. For example, in recent μs-long
simulations, AMPs did not disrupt the lipid bilayer, and no pores
were observed.35

It has been suggested
that electroporation (i.e., the establishment of a potential across
the membrane along with subsequent phenomena) is a reasonable method
to induce pore formation. Moreover, there have been reports on the
transport of molecules under TM potential using MD simulations. In
this study, we apply electroporation to investigate the PG-1 translocation
and attempt to link simulations to experimental results. We have carried
out a set of simulations listed in Table 1 to investigate the effect of charge imbalanced
methods, TM potential, P/L ratio, and bidentate bonds. Each system
was simulated three separate times, starting from the same positions
but using different initial velocities in the beginning of MD.

a Arg represents the wild-type PG-1,
while Lys indicates the charge-equivalent mutant. There are three
PG-1 dimers in high P/L ratio simulation for a total of six peptides.
The three dimers were placed parallel to the membrane surface initially.
The charge imbalance can be generated by different numbers of ions
(I) or peptides (P) in the two double bilayer systems. The charge
imbalance for the peptide method (P) is generated by keeping three
dimers in one system and subsequently removing dimers in another systems.

2.2.1 PG-1 Translocation under
TM Potential
The Arg6_10e_I case displayed PG-1 translocation
(Figure 7A) under ΔQ = 10e charge imbalance. At 1.0 ns, a
water pore
was formed with some lipids reorienting likely to stabilize the pore.
The peptide started to translocate and at 2.7 ns, the Arg residue
at position 4 (Arg4) reached the bilayer center, followed
by the translocation of the N-terminal Arg residue (Arg1). This inserted state was also stable until the end of the 10 ns
simulation. In this case, peptide translocation within the membrane
was only partial. Furthermore, we observed that a strong bidentate
hydrogen bond formed between the inserted Arg residue and lipid phosphate
groups during the simulation. This indicates that the bidentate complex
might be crucial for Arg insertion, which is consistent with experimental
findings.

different cases. (A) Arg6_10e_I. (B) Arg6_14e_I. (C) Arg6_14e_P. (D)
Arg0_10e_I. (E) Arg1_10e_I. (F) Lys6_10e_I. The description of each
case is in Table 1.

The TM potential for the Arg6_10e_I
allows only one or two Arg
residues to translocate at a time. In the following analysis, the
Arg6_10e_I case is regarded as a baseline for all other tests.

2.2.2 Comparison of Charge Imbalance Methods
For the Arg6_7e_I
and Arg6_7e_P cases, there was no pore formation
during 10 ns simulations, indicating that the TM potential generated
by ΔQ = 7e was too small.
Thereby, no other results are reported here. Generally, if the TM
potential is above a threshold value, the pore formation can be observed
in a few hundred picoseconds.

Figure 7B,C illustrates PG-1 translocation with two
different charge imbalance methods, Arg6_14e_I and Arg6_14e_P, respectively.
Results were similar with both methods. In both cases, we observe
a dimer translocating into the water pore from the membrane surface
under ΔQ = 14e charge imbalance.
For the Arg6_14e_I case, the TM potential is generated by ions in
the water subphase. In contrast, for the Arg6_14e_P case, the TM potential
is generated by the charges on the PG-1 itself, suggesting molecular
electroporation.26 In other words, the
highly charged PG-1 can generate sufficient TM potential to induce
pore formation and facilitate subsequent translocation as if an external
electric field is applied. This also provides evidence that PG-1 may
serve as a pore inducer.24

Removing
one peptide dimer from a bath results in a change of ΔQ = 7e per bilayer. From the Arg6_7e_P
and Arg6_14e_P cases, the system changes rapidly from no pore formation
to one translocated dimer, as shown in Figure 7C. To have a finer control of the ΔQ, we focused on the charge imbalance method from ions only.

2.2.3 Effect of TM Potential
Figure 7A,B illustrates the
results for Arg6_10e_I and Arg6_14e_I systems, respectively. For the
Arg6_14e_I case, a large water pore was formed in the bilayer within
several ps, and a few lipid flip-flops occurred. At 0.5 ns, one Arg
residue side chain started to protrude into the water pore, and it
reached the bilayer center by 1.0 ns. In addition, one PG-1 dimer
initially parallel to the membrane near the pore opening rotated to
align along the membrane normal. Shortly after the insertion of the
Arg residue, the whole dimer translocated into the bilayer and spanned
the entire pore. The inserted state remained stable until the end
of the 10 ns simulation. In contrast, the Arg6_10e_I case only shows
partial Arg insertions for PG-1, and the Arg6_7e_I case shows no pore
formation and peptide translocation at all. Clearly, we can observe
a TM voltage dependence on the pore formation and PG-1 translocation.

2.2.4 Effect of the P/L Ratio
Previous
studies have shown that AMPs adopt two distinct orientations depending
on the peptide/lipid ratio. In one, the orientation is parallel (at
low ratio) and in another perpendicular (at high ratio) to the bilayer
surface.36 The experimentally determined
threshold P/L value for PG-1 is 1:30.37 The underlying molecular reasons for this are unclear. In this work,
we performed simulations to examine the concentration dependence of
PG-1 translocation at low P/L (1:160) and at high P/L ratios (6:160).
The high P/L ratio is above the threshold value indicated from the
experiment.

Figure 7D shows snapshots for the Arg0_10e_I case (pure membrane).
With a TM potential, the pure membrane system can also form water
pores or columns. We noticed that the pore size shrinks during the
time interval between 3.0 and 10.0 ns. The stability of the pore will
be discussed later.

Figure 7E shows
snapshots for the Arg1_10e_I case. At 1.0 ns, small water pores started
to form because of the TM potential. At 3.0 ns, lipid head groups
redistributed toward the membrane interior. By 10.0 ns, a toroidal-shaped
pore developed. However, during these simulations, PG-1 remained bound
in parallel to the membrane surface. This is in contrast to the case
at the high P/L ratio where PG-1 molecules adopted a perpendicular
orientation to the bilayer in an inserted state (Figure 7A,B).

PG-1 stayed on
the membrane surface for a low P/L ratio, likely
because of the fact that the pore was formed relatively far from the
peptide. This might be attributed to the stiffness of the bilayer
in different domains. As previously shown, PG-1 forms extensive hydrogen
bonds with lipids, which could increase the stability of this domain.
It may be less likely for lipids in the vicinity of PG-1 to form a
water defect, which may later grow into pores. Similar results have
been reported by Reigada38 who simulated
the electroporation process for heterogeneous bilayers composed of
liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered regions. These authors found
that pore formation occurs preferably in the disordered region. On
the contrary, as the P/L ratio increases, the domain for the peptide-free
lipid region shrinks. Under TM potential, pores may form around PG-1,
and the ensuing lipid movement may trigger PG-1 translocation.

2.2.5 Effect of Substitution of Arg with Lys
Numerous investigations
have been conducted to examine Arg-rich
peptides. One particular analysis involved substituting Arg residues
with charge-equivalent Lys residues. In our work, we substituted Arg
residues in the Arg6_10e_I case with Lys residues in the Lys6_10e_I
case.

Figure 7F presents representative snapshots of the Lys6_10e_I system. Compared
to wild-type PG-1, a striking difference was observed, in that the
Lys mutant has a much reduced tendency for insertion. This finding
provides compelling evidence that the Arg guanidinium group is key
for PG-1 translocation. It lends support to the assumption that bidentate
bonds in Arg–phosphate complexes play a significant role in
aiding PG-1 insertion into the water pore. Indeed, NMR experiments
have shown that Lys–phosphate interactions are less stable
than Arg–phosphate interactions.21 This also indicates that PG-1 translocation is not simply driven
by the force due to TM potential.

It has been shown in the experiment
that Arg and Lys contribute
distinctively to cell uptake for CPPs and antimicrobial potency for
AMPs. For example, Mitchell et al. has shown that a synthetic CPP,
polyarginine (Arg)n, enters the cell more
efficiently than polylysine (Lys)n.39 In addition, Schmidt et al. reported that cryptdin-4
(Crp4), a potent bactericidal peptide, showed severely reduced antimicrobial
activity for complete Lys-for-Arg substitution.40 Consistent with these results, our MD simulations provide
molecular insight, demonstrating that the difference might be attributed
to the impact of bidentate bonds on the propensity of peptide insertion
in a lipid bilayer.

2.2.6 Discharging of TM Potential
As
described in the Methods section, one drawback
of electroporation by the charge imbalance method is that the imbalance
is not reset during the simulation. The TM potential drops rapidly
after the formation of a water pore and subsequent ion transfer. To
focus on the interactions between PG-1 and lipids without a collapsing
potential, we have added weak constraints to prevent ions from passing
through the water pore. However, lipid flip-flop of anionic palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol
(POPG) or PG-1 translocation (i.e., Arg transfer) can also result
in the TM potential being discharged. Because the focus of the study
is the translocation of PG-1, along with lipid flip-flop, we did not
restrict these motions with added constraints.

It is instructive
to show the change of ΔQ in different cases,
as illustrated in Figure 8. One charge transfer will alter ΔQ by 2e. POPG flip-flop occurred within a few ns,
and all observed flip-flop events were directed from Bath 1 (with
excess negative charge) to Bath 2 (with excess positive charge), (see Figure 12.). Conversely,
Arg residues always inserted in the reverse direction. The region
of each bath was divided by the bilayer center. Phosphorus and Cζ atoms were used to determine the location of lipids
and Arg residues in the baths.

Figure 8 Change of the charge difference ΔQ across
each bilayer in the 10 ns simulations. Charge transfers due to PG-1
translocation are highlighted. The N-terminal Arg is denoted as Arg1, which has +2 charge. The Arg residue at position 4 is denoted
as Arg4. All others are due to POPG flip-flop. Results
are shown for the Arg6_10e_I, Arg1_10e_I and Lys6_10e_I systems. The
points are added every 20 ps.

As can be observed in Figure 8, the discharging rate was much faster for the Arg6_10e_I
system. It took less than 4 ns for the system to be fully discharged.
For the Lys6_10e_I system, it took about 6 ns to discharge. The Arg1_10e_I
system discharged the TM potential in more than 10 ns. Evidently,
the discharging rate is faster for systems with the higher peptide
concentration.

It is also worth mentioning that the ion constraints
implemented
in this work could be relaxed and the ion-water swap techniques may
be applied to maintain the constant voltage across the membrane. However,
care must be taken because all transfers of ions, POPG lipids, or
charged residues result in changes of ΔQ. The
user could, in principle, reset the charge imbalance for all of these
events. In practice, one must always be mindful of the artificial
nature of the simulated systems and processes.

2.3 PMF Calculation
It has been proposed
that interactions between charged protein residues and lipid phosphate
groups or water can provide the energy needed to overcome the insertion
energy barrier for charged residues to insert inside the membrane.21 It is therefore interesting to study the thermodynamic
driving forces of PG-1 insertion.

A total of 3 μs umbrella
sampling simulations were conducted to mimic the insertion processes
of lipid, PG-1, and the lipid/PG-1 complex (Figure 9). The PMF profiles for these processes were
obtained and compared (Figure 10).

Figure 9 Illustration of the pulling groups of (A) lipid, (B) PG-1,
and
(C) lipid/PG-1 complex at the bilayer center. The green spheres highlight
the pulling atoms. For (A), the pulling atom is the phosphorus atom.
For (B), the pulling atom is the Cζ atom of the Arg.
For (C), the pulling atom is the phosphorus atom, while the bidentate
hydrogen bonds are restrained by harmonic forces shown in yellow dashes.

Figure 10 PMFs for moving the pulling atom into
the center of a POPE/POPG
bilayer for the lipid, peptide, and bidentate complex. The PMFs were
obtained from umbrella sampling calculations, while the pulling atom
was restrained at a varying distance from the bilayer center of mass,
in the direction normal to the plane of the bilayer. The error bars
were determined by bootstrap analysis.

For the pure palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (POPE)/POPG
bilayer, we obtained a relative free energy barrier for a single POPE
flip-flop of 81.1 kJ/mol. The relative free energy barrier for a PG-1
Arg residue insertion was 94.9 kJ/mol. Figure 9A,B illustrates the lipid head and the Arg
residue at bilayer center, respectively. We notice that there was
no spontaneous pore formation. Only a water-filled membrane defect
(water column from one side) occurred.

The relative free energy
barrier for the lipid/PG-1 complex was
124.8 kJ/mol. This free energy is still higher than that for a single
lipid flip-flop. The actual timescale required for lipid flip-flops
ranges between minutes and hours.23 With
a higher free energy barrier, it is expected that the timescale for
the bidentate complex translocation may take even longer. Consequently,
the argument that the bidentate complex facilitates pore formation
by dragging phosphate groups as Arg residue inserts into the hydrophobic
part of the membrane appears less convincing.17

It is proposed that formation of transient water pores is
the rate-limiting
step in the process of TM lipid flip-flop.41,42 Once a pore has been formed, the ensuing lipid translocation takes
place on timescales of nanoseconds as observed from our electroporation
simulations. We reason that water pore formation can not only increase
lipid flip-flop rates but also facilitate the PG-1 translocation.

It should be stressed that the insertion processes used for PMF
calculations are not directly comparable to those of the electroporation
processes. In the latter, a water pore forms first, and lipids reorient
themselves before PG-1 insertion takes place. In the former, a water
defect is formed as the forced insertion process takes place.

It should also be stressed that the presented PMF calculations
are of artificially built systems. The definition of the PMF zero
level is entirely operational and only pertains to the presented cases.
Consequently, these PMFs alone, without reactive trajectory sampling,
can offer only very limited mechanistic interpretations. In other
words, in the absence of simulations that accurately capture the vast
phase space during the entire process of peptides moving from the
bulk water subphase onto membranes and then inside the lipid core,
any proposal of molecular mechanisms underlying biological phenomena
must be considered tentative. Unfortunately, despite amazing improvements
in both simulation software and hardware, such simulations are currently
implausible. Nonetheless, MD simulations, for all their limitations,
are often the only scientifically agreeable approach to capturing
the vast complexity of biomolecular interactions in a way fit for
forming sound hypotheses.

2.4 Stability of Water Pores
with PG-1 Inserted
It is reported from the experiment that
membrane pores induced
by membrane-active peptides have a much longer lifetime than transient
pores induced by thermal energy. Computer simulations also showed
that many membrane-active peptides can stabilize membrane pores. This
motivates us to study the role of PG-1 in pore stability.

Figure 11A shows the dynamics
of water pores for the pure membrane system (Arg0_10e_I) after we
release the constraints on ions. It is observed that the transient
water pore was resealed within 30 ns. In contrast, if there is a PG-1
inserted in a water pore (Arg6_10e_I), the pore remained open for
the subsequent 200 ns, as shown in Figure 11B. This is similar to the kinetic stabilization
of octa-arginine peptides reported by Sun et al.25 Therefore, we reason that PG-1 is able to stabilize and
slow down the kinetic rate of water pore closure. This also provides
evidence that PG-1 can serve as a pore stabilizer after insertion.24

pure membrane
pores Arg0_10e_I and (B) membrane pores with PG-1 inserted from the
Arg6_10e_I system.

2.5 Proposed
Mechanism for PG-1 Translocation
We have applied a computational
electroporation method to study
PG-1 translocation. The highly charged PG-1 generates molecular electroporation
as if an external electric field is applied. Under conditions of a
sufficient TM potential, a water pore or column will form across the
membrane.

There have been extensive studies on the collective
motions of pore formation and lipid flip-flop.41,42 It has been proposed that formation of pores unavoidably results
in lipid flip-flop. This is called the pore-mediated lipid flip-flop
mechanism. In this study, we found that with the strong interactions
of bidentate bonds in the guanidinium–phosphate complex, it
is likely that the Arg residues might be dragged by the lipids during
the diffusive TM transport through the water pores. This in turn may
lead to PG-1 insertion and translocation. The charge-equivalent lysine
mutant showed reduced permeability. This shows that PG-1 insertion
is not simply driven by strong TM potential, and the bidentate complex
may play an important role in translocation.

Although we applied
electroporation by imposing a charge imbalance
to induce pore formation, it should be emphasized that transient pores
may form under different circumstances. For example, the mechanical
stress created by peptide aggregation is also considered to produce
pores to relieve membrane line tension.25,43

In addition,
we also showed that PG-1 insertion can stabilize water
pores and slow down the kinetic rate of pore closure. We therefore
propose that PG-1 may be capable of inducing pore formation by electrical
or mechanical tension. The pore-mediated, lipid flip-flop driven PG-1
insertion process facilitates PG-1 translocation. The inserted PG-1
can further increase the stability of the water pores. The whole process
from PG-1 inducing to stabilizing water pores may form a feedback
loop, thereby highlighting a great example of collective motions in
biological membranes.

3 Conclusions
We have
applied various MD protocols to study the interactions
between PG-1 and lipids that underlie the peptide translocation process.
Arg residues are crucial for PG-1 to bind on the membrane surface.
An extensive network of bidentate bonds is formed between Arg guanidinium
and lipid phosphate groups. Electroporation simulations illustrate
that a strong TM potential results in water pore formation and the
disruption of the membrane. The charge on the PG-1 is large enough
to create TM potential to induce water pores. Lipid flip-flops and
PG-1 translocation then take place in a few ns near the water pore.
In addition, a threshold P/L appears to be necessary for the water
pores to form in the vicinity of PG-1. Furthermore, the Arg to Lys
substitution significantly reduces the insertion propensity, which
strongly indicates that the bidentate hydrogen bonds facilitate PG-1
translocation. Moreover, the inserted PG-1 can stabilize water pores.
PMF calculations show that the barrier for the bidentate complex is
still high for insertion into the hydrophobic environment. We reason
that PG-1 might be a pore inducer to facilitate water pore formation,
which is a rate-limiting step for lipid flip-flop and for PG-1 translocation.
After pore formation, lipids that flip-flop may drag PG-1 by virtue
of the bidentate bond strength. The inserted PG-1 serves as a pore
stabilizer after translocation.

4 Methods
and Theory
4.1 PG-1 Simulation System Preparation
The solvated peptide–membrane systems for various simulations
were constructed using CHARMM-GUI.44−47 The initial structures of the
PG-1 monomer and dimer were taken from the protein data bank (PDB
IDs: 1PG1 and 1ZY6, respectively.7,8) The bilayer was modeled using the 3:1 mixture of POPE and POPG
lipids, mimicking the components of the inner membrane of Gram-negative
bacteria.48 There were 120 POPE molecules
and 40 POPG molecules in the system. POPE is neutral, while the anionic
POPG has a net (−1) charge. TIP3P waters49 were added on each side of the membrane with a thickness
of approximately 3 nm. The systems were neutralized by adding potassium
and chloride as counter ions. There were 40 potassium atoms, and the
number of chloride atoms depended on the number of simulated peptides.

To investigate the interactions of PG-1 with the POPE and POPG
lipid bilayers, three sets of 50 ns simulations were performed. The
PG-1 monomer was initially placed in the water subphase, approximately
2.0 nm away from the phosphorus atoms of the upper membrane leaflet.
This system is denoted as PG-1_POPE:POPG.

4.2 Computational
Electroporation Setup
The electroporation simulations were
carried out to mimic a TM potential
and to facilitate PG-1 translocation. The system was set up with a
double bilayer configuration by duplicating a second bilayer on top
of the original bilayer (Figure 12). PG-1 molecules were initially
placed at the equilibrium position on the membrane (approximately
2.2 nm from the bilayer center) as determined by PG-1 membrane simulations
described in section 2.1. A TM potential was generated by two different methods. The
first one is by swapping ions and waters in Bath 1 and in Bath 2,
creating a charge imbalance.50 The second
one is to keep PG-1 in Bath 1 and partially remove PG-1 in Bath 2
to create a charge imbalance. The number of chloride is adjusted to
maintain a neutral system. The number of ions remain the same for
both baths. The former is considered as applying an external electric
field, while the latter is regarded as an intrinsic electric field
generated by the charges on the PG-1 itself. The charge difference
is denoted as ΔQ. The whole system maintained
zero net charge.

Figure 12 Schematic representation of the double bilayer system
with a charge
imbalance ΔQ across each bilayer. The classical
3D periodic boundary condition is implemented. POPG lipids are shown
in purple. POPE lipids are shown in gray. Potassium ions are shown
in orange. Chloride ions are shown in green. Peptides on the membrane
surface are shown in spherical beads. Waters are represented with
a semitransparent surface.

Nine test cases were considered (listed in Table 1) to investigate the effect
of four different
factors on the PG-1 translocation: (1) the comparison of the two charge
imbalance methods. (2) The influence of TM potential was studied by
varying the charge difference ΔQ in the double
bilayer system. (3) The concentration dependence of peptides was examined
by changing the peptide to lipid (P/L) ratio. (4) The importance of
the guanidinium group was investigated by substituting Arg with charge-equivalent
Lys residues.

One important drawback of the charge imbalance
method is that the
imbalance is not reset during the simulation. Once a charged particle
transfers to other sides of the membrane, the system ΔQ changes. A protocol using a swapping method has been proposed
to maintain a constant charge imbalance.51 In this procedure, the number of ions in the two solution baths
is counted frequently and, if the number differs from the initial
setup, a swapping action is carried out: an ion of one solution is
exchanged by a water molecule of the other solution bath. However,
this method only accounts for the change of charge imbalance due to
ion flow. This approach has some limitations in our system. In addition
to ions, there are anionic lipids, POPG and cationic PG-1 molecules,
in the system. Any POPG lipid flip-flop or peptide transport through
the membrane alters the imbalance as well. It is not clear how to
best deal with some of these events. In this study, to avoid such
situations, we added a weak one-dimensional constraint (force constant
100 kJ mol–1 nm–2) on the ion
positions along the membrane normal (z-direction).
This constraint still allows ions to diffuse in their original baths
but prevents them from passing across the membrane. Although the system
could still discharge because of translocation of lipids or peptides,
time scales for such events are slow enough for the dynamic events
of interest to take place well before the system is fully discharged,
as shown in the Results and Discussion section.

4.3 PMF Calculation
To calculate the
free energy of PG-1 translocation and to shed light on the importance
of the bidentate complex, we performed umbrella sampling simulations
for three systems. In system A, the lipid flip-flop free energy was
obtained by pulling a phosphorus atom of a single lipid into the bilayer
center. In system B, the energy cost of PG-1 insertion was calculated
by pulling a Cζ atom on an Arg residue into the bilayer
center. In system C, the free energy of the combined lipid and PG-1
system was measured by pulling into the bilayer center a phosphorus
atom on the lipid that has harmonic constraints on the bidentate hydrogen
bonds.

The reaction coordinate of the PMF was defined as the
distance to the bilayer center along the bilayer normal. The window
size was 0.1 nm. An umbrella potential of a force constant 3000 kJ
mol–1 nm–2 was used for each window
to hold the pulling groups together. A production run of 50 ns was
performed for each window. The PMFs were evaluated using the g_wham
tool in GROMACS.52

4.4 MD Simulation
Details
All simulations
in this work were conducted using the GROMACS 5.1 package.53 All-atom simulations were run at a temperature
of 310.15 K using a Nosé–Hoover thermostat54,55 with a coupling time constant of 1.0 ps. The semi-isotropic pressure
coupling method was used with both lateral and perpendicular pressures
(both 1 atm) independently coupled to the Parrinello–Rahman
barostat56 with a coupling time constant
of 5 ps and a compressibility of 4.5 × 10–5. Periodic boundary conditions were employed. The simulation time
step was 2 fs. The CHARMM36 force field57 was used for proteins and lipids, and the TIP3P model49 was used for waters. The cutoffs for the van
der Waals interactions and electrostatic interactions calculated using
the particle-mesh Ewald method58 were both
1.2 nm. The van der Waals interactions were smoothly turned off between
1.0 and 1.2 nm with the force-switching method. The LINCS algorithm59 was used to constrain all of the hydrogen bonds.
