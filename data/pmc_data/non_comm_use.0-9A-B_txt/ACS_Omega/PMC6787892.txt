A luminescent
terbium metal–organic framework [Tb(HPIA–)(PIA2–)(H2O)2] (Tb-MOF),
synthesized by a lanthanide metal ion (Tb3+) and nitric
heterocyclic carboxylic acid ligands H2PIA
(H2PIA = 5-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)isophthalic-acid),
was structurally characterized as a three-dimensional skeleton structure
in which layered coordination frameworks are connected by hydrogen
bonds. Based on the antenna effect, Tb-MOF can emit bright green fluorescence
under 254 nm excitation, and the fluorescence emission presents excellent
durability in aqueous solutions among a wide pH range. Moreover, the
structure of Tb-MOF also possesses outstanding thermal stabilities.
In some ways, PO43– and its derivatives
are thought to be a kind of pollutant ion causing series environmental
and health problems. The as-synthesized Tb-MOF exhibits prominent
selectivity and remarkable sensitivity for detecting PO43– as an easy-to-use fluorescent probe with low
detection limit, fast response, and wide detection range. Therefore,
Tb-MOF has significant applications in the fields of human health
and environmental monitoring.

==== Body
Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs), as one of the research
hotspots over the past few years, are a sort of self-assembly supermolecular
crystalline porous materials.1−4 MOF is usually centered on metal ions or clusters
to combine a periodic framework with organic ligands. For multiple
articles reported, due to its well-developed porosity, high surface
area, and tunable uniform pore size, MOF shows great potential application
prospect, such as drug loading,5,6 gas adsorption, storage
and separation,7,8 heterogeneous catalysis,9−11 chemical sensing,12−16 and bioimaging.17,18

Recently, the influence
of certain anions on environmental pollution
has become more and more serious, therefore such pollutant ions have
received extensive attention in many aspects.19 For instance, acid rain is made from excessive emission of NO3– and SO42–, which result from burning fossil fuels and automobile exhausts
in the air. Not only are halogen ions extremely irritating and highly
toxic to human bodies, but they are also very corrosive to many substances.20,21 About PO43–, as a derivative of phosphorus,
plays a vital role in the process of living things such as gene regulation,
genetic material, signal transmission, and energy storage.22,23 From another perspective, PO43– is
a common pollutant anion of industrial production in aquatic ecosystems,
which leads to overgrowth of algae and eutrophication of water. Besides,
excessive phosphate and its derivatives can also affect the absorption
of calcium ions in the human bodies and cause irreversible harm to
people’s life.24−26 As a pollutant anion, PO43– possesses less binding reactive sites and lower reactivity, so detection
of PO43– emerges a major challenge in
the field of chemosensors.27−29

Conventionally, contaminant
anion detection methods are expensive,
complicated, time-consuming, and difficult to operate. As one branch
of MOF, lanthanide-based MOF (Ln-MOF) has unique luminescence properties
with high luminescence purity, long fluorescence-emission lifetime,
and high luminescence quantum efficiency,30−34 which make them widely used in research and preparation
of fluorescent sensors. Meanwhile, nitrogen-containing carboxylic
acid ligands have plurality of coordination sites, and high charge
density of the lanthanide ions making it possesses unique Lewis basic
sites.35 In summary, Ln-MOF assembled by
lanthanide ions coordinated has critical influence on detection properties
because of possessing varied topologies and suitable pore size, which
make it possibly get high selectivity and sensitivity of detecting
phosphate radicals.36 Yet compared to ordinary
instrument detection methods, fluorescence-based chemosensors have
attracted widespread attention because of their fascinating properties.37

In this work, a lanthanide fluorescent
MOF characterized as a novel
three-dimensional skeleton structure was fabricated by mixing lanthanide
salts of Tb(Cl3)3·6H2O and nitric
heterocyclic carboxylic acid ligands of H2PIA (H2PIA = 5-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)isophthalic-acid) (Figure
S1 of Supporting Information) under hydrothermal
reaction with a molar ratio of 5:12. The terbium- metal–organic
framework (Tb-MOF) was tested to be highly sensitive and selective
on PO43– detection with visible luminescent
quenching. Moreover, the synthesized Tb-MOF shows great thermal stability
and structural stability in aqueous solution and acid–base
aqueous solutions. To sum up, Tb-MOF can be utilized as an ideal easy-manipulation
luminescent probe for detecting PO43– with low detection limit, fast response time, and wide detection
range, which provides possibilities of anion recognition process in
water or other more polar solvents.

Results and Discussion
Crystal
Structure
The single-crystal X-ray diffraction
analysis indicated that Tb-MOF crystallizes in P1̅
space group belonging to the triclinic system. As shown in Figure 1a, there are one
Tb(III) metal center, one HPIA– ligand, one PIA2– ligand, and two coordinated water molecules in an
asymmetric unit. Tb3+ adopts octahedral-coordinated biaugmented
trigonal prism geometric configuration analyzed by the Shape software,
in which coordinated atoms originate from six carboxylate oxygen atoms,
four different ligands, and two coordinated water molecules. The Tb–O
bond lengths and O–Tb–O bond angles are in the range
of 2.322(2)–2.493(2) Å and 52.71(7)–145.42(7)°,
respectively, which correspond with other reported Tb-MOF.38,39 The Tb3+ ions are linked by ligand HPIA– and PIA2– to construct a 2D layered structure
(Figure 1b). Furthermore,
the 2D sheet structures are joined through the O–H···O
hydrogen bond to fabricate a 3D framework with a channel of 8.8 ×
3.5 Å2 (Figure 1c,d). Intriguingly, the ligand H2PIA adopts two
different coordination modes. In ligand HPIA–, one
protonated carboxylate group is free while another is deprotonated
using μ1–η1η1-chelating coordination mode. In ligand PIA2–,
two deprotonated carboxylate groups have the same coordination fashion
as the μ2–η1η1-bridging coordination mode. In both ligand HPIA– and PIA2–, the pyrrole group is free and not involved
in coordination configuration, which can be the active sites to bind
specific chemicals (Figure 2a,b). The crystallographic data and structure refinement,
main bond length, bond angle, and hydrogen data for Tb-MOF are listed
in Tables S1–S3 of the Supporting Information.

General Characterization
of Tb-MOF
It is shown in Figure
S2 of the Supporting Information that the
tested powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the Tb-MOF corresponds
to main diffraction peaks of the simulated pattern which is obtained
by Mercury software, displaying that Tb-MOF has good phase purity.
Otherwise, the FT-IR spectrum was performed and exhibited that the
as-synthesized Tb-MOF has broad and scattered bands at 3300–2540
cm–1 as it is shown in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information, which can be attributed
to stretching vibration of −OH. The band at 1696 cm–1 of Tb-MOF shifts to 1616 cm–1, indicating that
the carboxyl group of the ligand has been successfully deprotonated
and coordinated with the Tb3+ ions. As shown in Figures
S4 and S5 of the Supporting Information, the PXRD analysis indicated that the Tb-MOF maintains structural
integrity not only in aqueous solution for 3 days but also in distilled
water at the different pH values of 2, 5, 7, 8, and 10. To further
explore the thermal stability of Tb-MOF, the thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was carried out in range 30–1200 °C (Figure S6, Supporting Information). When the temperature
rises from 30 to 120 °C, the TGA curve of Tb-MOF does not show
an obvious weightless platform, demonstrating that the structure of
Tb-MOF has not begun to breakdown. However, the weight loss of the
Tb-MOF is about 2.9% from 120 to 182 °C, which is consistent
with one coordinated water molecule contained in the asymmetric unit
of Tb-MOF (calculated as 2.8%). When the temperature is between 244
and 315 °C, the weight loss is also about 2.9%, which can be
attributed to the removal of another coordinated water molecule (calculated
as 2.8%). Finally, the structure is collapsed gradually after 493
°C.

Photoluminescence Properties
The solid-state fluorescence
property of Tb-MOF has been investigated under room temperature (Figure 3). The spectrum of
the ligand shows a broad emission peak at 393 nm with the excitation
wavelength at 331 nm, which can be responding to the π–π*
transition of H2PIA ligands. At the excitation of 319 nm,
the solid-state fluorescence spectrum of Tb-MOF has four characteristic
emission peaks of Tb3+ at 493, 546, 589, and 624 nm, corresponding
to the f–f transition at 5D4–7F6, 5D4–7F5, 5D4–7F4, and 5D4–7F3, respectively. Moreover, as shown in the inset photography of Figure 3b, the Tb-MOF can
emit strong green fluorescence color under the portable ultraviolet
lamp (excitation wavelength of 254 nm). Studies have shown that the
energy absorbed by the ligands has been transferred to the central
Tb3+ ion, which means the center metal ion is sensitized
by the ligand, basing on the antenna effect.32,40−42 Furthermore, the Tb-MOF shows splendid chemical stability
not only in the framework structure but also in relative fluorescence
intensity. There is no obvious change in the fluorescence intensity
spectra of Tb-MOF by soaking in deionized water for 7 days (Figure 4a). Besides, when
the ground solid samples were treated by acid–base aqueous
solutions with pH from 1 to 14, the fluorescence intensity was measured
and shown substantially stable with pH in the range of 3–10
at room temperature (Figure 4b).

Detecting PO43– in Aqueous Solutions
For testing the
effect on the fluorescence signal of the anions
detected by Tb-MOF, the ground Tb-MOF is dispersed in aqueous solutions
containing different anionic sodium salts (NaX, Xn– = F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, Cr2O7–, N3–, SCN–, PO43–, CO32–, SO42–, AC–, NO3–, NO2–) (with
concentration of 0.01 M). The suspensions were treated by ultrasonication
for 10 min. For its bright visible green fluorescent color, it was
observed that Tb-MOF in the solution containing PO43– showed significant fluorescence quenching phenomenon
and can be easily captured by naked eyes under a portable UV lamp
(the excitation wavelength is 254 nm) (bottom graph in Figure 5a). Besides, there is no obvious
fluorescence change while suspension contains other anions. In order
to confirm this phenomenon, fluorescence spectra of Tb-MOF in different
solutions were measured (Figure 5a). By comparing the relative fluorescence intensity
of Tb-MOF at 546 nm, only the solution containing PO43– has distinct fluorescence quenching. To further explore
the identification properties of Tb-MOF about PO43–, more experimental methods were adopted. The ground solid sample
was uniformly dispersed into the aqueous solution with gradually increasing
the concentration of PO43–. As shown
in Figure 5c, when
the concentration of PO43– reached 3.27
× 10–4 M, the fluorescence intensity at 546
nm is almost quenched entirely. Then, the luminescent intensities
at 5D4–7F5 transitions
(546 nm) were monitored which reveals orderly gradual decline, and
the detection limit is down to 4.5 ppm. Moreover, the quenching curve
of phosphate recognition analyzed by the Stern–Volmer nearly
shows a quadratic linear at the whole concentration range with a linear
fit correlation coefficient of 0.9958 (Figure 5d).43,44 The comparisons of
the Tb-MOF probe and other sensing methods for PO43– are listed in Table S4 of the Supporting Information.

Actual sewage treatment
usually contains many other anions that
may interfere with sensing of MOF-based sensors. Therefore, the anti-interfere
sensing experiment was carried out. The ground Tb-MOF (2 mg) was dispersed
in 3 mL deionized water and ultrasonicated, and the luminescent intensity
of the suspension has no obvious change after adding other anions.
Because the equal PO43– was added, the
fluorescence intensity at 546 nm quenched instantly. As shown in Figure 5b, it has been found
that the fluorescence intensity of the MOF-based sensors was still
quenched effectively while mixed with other anionic solutions after
being treated by PO43–.

Undoubtedly,
fast response is also important for practical applications
of fluorescence chemosensors. Hence, by mixing the ground Tb-MOF suspension
solution (1 mg, 2 mL) with phosphate ions (0.01 M, 1 mL), we collected
the time-response profile of Tb-MOF toward PO43–, as shown in Figure S7 of the Supporting Information, in a short period of ∼60 s contact with PO43–, the emission intensity of the Tb-MOF suspension
remains only ∼40%, which reveals that PO43– has a relatively rapid weakening effect on the luminescence of Tb-MOF.

Mechanism of the Luminescent Quenching Effect
Mechanism
of sensing analytes by fluorescence quenching of MOF materials has
been reported in several literatures in recent years. Above all, it
is likely that the following four statements: (a) the interaction
of ions with organic ligands in MOF,45,46 (b) the collapse
of the MOF structure,47,48 (c) a weak interaction of anions
with metal ions in MOF,49−51 and (d) the coverage between
the UV absorption peak of the analyte and the excitation or emission
spectra of the MOF.52,53 As shown in Figure S8 of the Supporting Information, for exploring the mechanism
of the chemical sensing by Tb-MOF to PO43–, first, the PXRD patterns of Tb-MOF treated with PO43– were obtained. Obviously, there is no significant
change, which means that the structure is not destroyed. Thus, the
fluorescence quenching caused by the collapse of the Tb-MOF structure
does not make sense. Then, the UV–vis absorption peak of PO43– shows no distinct overlap with the excitation
and emission spectra of Tb-MOF (Figure S9). As shown in Figure S10, the luminescent
lifetime has a certain degree of attenuation after being treated by
PO43–, hence the recognition mechanism
is a dynamic quenching process. After this, a further exploration
of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out (Figure 6). After being treated
with PO43–, a newly observed peak can
be assigned to 2p orbital of P element at around 135 eV (Figure S11
of Supporting Information). Other than
this, by analyzing the XPS spectra of the 3d orbital of Tb, it can
be seen that it is negatively shifted from 1244.1 to 1243.2 eV. It
is proved that PO43– has a weak interaction
with Tb3+ after entering the pore channel, which affects
the energy transfer from the ligand to the central ion. Moreover,
according to the Figure S12, it is obviously
that the binding energy of N 1s and O 1s has little change, suggesting
the N and O atoms from the ligand do not interact with PO43– ions. Above all, the fluorescence quenching
mechanism maybe attributing to the weak coordination between Tb3+ and PO43– ions.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a novel
luminescent Tb-MOF was obtained as colorless
block crystals by means of the hydrothermal method to assemble Tb3+ and nitric heterocyclic carboxylic acid. The colorless crystals
can emit characteristic green fluorescence color under the irradiation
of ultraviolet light. We found that the as-synthesized Tb-MOF can
specifically recognize phosphate ions from a series of common inorganic
anions. More importantly, with regard to phosphate ions sensing in
aqueous solution, Tb-MOF displays high sensitivity and selectivity,
visible for the naked eyes, fast response, and low detection limit
(4.5 ppm). In addition, Tb-MOF exhibits good structural and fluorescent
stability against water with a relatively wide range of pH value (3–10).
Given all the superior performance, it is believed that our work may
provide a simple and highly efficient method to monitor the content
of phosphate ions in aqueous solution.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
All reactants of H2PIA ligands, TbCl3·6H2O, and other reagents
were purchased from commercial sources and were used without further
purifications. The FT-IR spectra were analyzed with PerkinElmer Spectra
(4000–400 cm–1) using KBr pellets. Elemental
analyses for C, H, and N were characterized on a PerkinElmer 2400
elemental analyzer. The PXRD patterns were carried out for crystalline
phases on an Empyrean Panalytical apparatus with single crystal power
in the range of 5°–80° using Cu Kα radiation.
Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were monitored by a Hitachi
F-7000 Spectro-photometer at room temperature (the slit width for
the excitation and the emission were kept at 5.0 and 2.5 nm, respectively).
TGA curves were measured with a NETZSCH STA409pc apparatus under a
heating rate of 10 °C/min from 30 to 1200 °C in the nitrogen
protection. The luminescent lifetime was performed with an Edinburgh
FLS920 spectrograph under a microsecond lamp. UV–visible absorption
and emission spectra were recorded on a U-3900 spectrograph with the
adopted absorption value method. XPS was analyzed for chemical composition
of the crystal performed on Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi with a monochromatic
Al Kα.

Synthesis of Tb-MOF
By mixing TbCl3·6H2O (0.05 mmol), H2PIA (0.12
mmol) and then ultrasonic
dispersed in H2O (7 mL) evenly with pH adjusted by adding
20 μL HCl (1 M) solution. Transfer the suspension to a 25 mL
Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel. The sealed autoclave was heated
to 140 °C for 3 days and cooled to room temperature at 2 °C
per hour. The samples were washed with deionized water two or three
times to remove the impurities, and then a series of colorless block
crystals were gained. Yield: 12.8% based on TbCl3·6H2O. C22H15N4O10Tb (654.30): calcd C, 40.38; H, 2.31; N, 8.56. Found C, 39.23; H,

609.35(m), 507.19(m).

pH Stability Experiments
An amount
of ground Tb-MOF
(1 mg) has been ultrasonicated and dispersed in 3 mL aqueous solution
(adjust pH with NaOH or HCl) of pH at 1, 2, 3, ... 13, 14, and then
immersed in these acid–base aqueous solutions and sonicated
for 10 min. The suspension samples were used to do fluorescence monitoring.
After 24 h storage in beakers, the ground solid samples were washed
with deionized water two or three times and desiccated for PXRD testing.

Sensing Experiments
Two milligrams of ground Tb-MOF
were uniformly dispersed in 3 mL of varied anionic aqueous solutions
(NaX, Xn– = F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, Cr2O7–, N3–, SCN–, PO43–, CO32–, SO42–, AC–, NO3–, NO2–) (with concentration of 0.01 M) by sonicating
for 10 min, the samples of several suspensions were used for sensing
experiments with fluorescent measurements. The concentration-depending
sensing experiment was as followed. Ground Tb-MOF (1 mg) was uniformly
dispersed into the aqueous solution 1 mL by sonicating for 10 min.
Meanwhile, a PO43– aqueous solution of
10–3 M was added dropwise to the suspension for
evaluating the sensitivity toward PO43–. Then, the luminescent intensities at 5D4–7F5 transitions (546 nm) were monitored. Furthermore,
to study whether selectively identifying PO43– of Tb-MOF can be affected by other anionic species, different anions
were added with 0.01 M concentration of 3 mL (NaX, Xn– = F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, Cr2O7–, N3–, SCN–, PO43–, CO32–, SO42–, AC–, NO3–, NO2–) in
3 mg of ground solid samples, then added 2 mL of PO43– aqueous solution (0.01 M) and sonicated for 10 min
to get the suspensions, and the fluorescence test was conducted immediately.

Crystallography
The single-crystal X-ray diffraction
data for relevant Tb-MOF crystal were collected on a Bruker APEX-II
CCD X-ray single-crystal diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromatic
Mo Kα radiation at 273.15 K. The SADABS program was used for
absorption corrections. The crystal structure was solved by the direct
method through SHELXTL-97 and OLEX-2 program, and the crystal data
were refined against F2 values by the
full-matrix least-squares technique method. The position of hydrogen
atoms was determined in theory using the riding model. The detailed
crystallographic data and structural refinement information are listed
in Table S1. Selected bond lengths and
bond angles are given in Table S2. Crystallographic
data for the Tb-MOF fabricated in this paper have been deposited free

publication as the CCDC number 1852839.
