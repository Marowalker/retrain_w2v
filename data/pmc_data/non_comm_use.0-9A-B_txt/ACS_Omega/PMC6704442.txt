Breast cancer is
the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
Despite progress in drug discovery, identification of the correct
population is the limiting factor to develop new compounds in the
clinical setting. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate
the effects of a new metallodrug, [RuCl(p-cymene)(N,N-bis(diphenylphosphino)-isopropylamine)][BF4] (pnpRu-14), as a lead pnp-Ru compound by screening
and preliminary biochemical and biological studies in different breast
cancer subtypes. The results show that complex pnpRu-14 is much more effective in promoting in vitro cytotoxic effects on
HER2+ and RH+/HER2– breast cancer than the reference metallodrugs
cisplatin, carboplatin, or RAPTA-C. It is important to highlight that pnpRu-14 shows an impressive cytotoxicity against BT474 cells.
Caspase-dependent apoptosis is the mechanism of action for these compounds.
In addition, treatment of SKBR3, BT474, T47D, and MCF7 cancer cells
with pnpRu-14 caused an accumulation of cells in the
G0/G1 phase cells. The human serum albumin, DNA, and H1 histones binding
properties of the lead compound are reported. Pharmacokinetic and
biodistribution studies show a quick absorption of pnpRu-14 in serum with no significant accumulation in any of the tested organs.
This work provides evidence to support the preclinical and clinical
development of pnpRu-14 in breast cancer.

1 Introduction
Although
most of the efforts in cancer drug development are based
on the discovery of organic molecules, including those designed for
specific molecular alterations, inorganic agents like platinum compounds
are still the backbone for most therapies in the treatment of solid
tumors.1 In this context, the identification
of inorganic agents that can improve available therapies is a main
goal. In fact, metallodrugs in cancer therapy are being widely used
and a variety of quite different metals with distinctive approaches
are currently in research development.2

Ruthenium is a clear example.3 New
metallodrugs
based on ruthenium have been tested against an important number of
cancer cell lines.4 In this context, it
is expected that ruthenium metallodrugs would offer much potential
as cytostatic and cytotoxic drugs than platinum derivatives, as other
mechanisms of action beyond the mere induction of DNA damage, can
mediate their biological effect. Four Ru therapeutics have entered
clinical trials during the last years (Figure 1). NAMI-A succeeded phase I clinical studies,
but limited efficacy was obtained in phase II clinical studies,5 whereas the low solubility of KP1019 limited
further development. The KP1339 is currently undergoing clinical studies.6 TLD1433 entered phase IIa clinical trials for
nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer.7

Figure 1 Structures
of the most relevant ruthenium metallodrugs in cancer
therapy.

Because ruthenium(III) agents
are pro-drugs and need activation
by reduction, organometallic ruthenium(II) metallodrugs are being
explored. Many of them, which are particularly attractive to the medicinal
chemists because of their structural variability, have been reported
as promising antitumoral agents. The most relevant candidates were
reported by the group of Dyson.8 RAPTA-C9 derivatives are investigated as antimetastatic
agents, whereas RAED-C10 displays potent
cytotoxicity in vitro neoplastic cells.

In the field of organometallic
ruthenium(II) metallodrugs, we recently
reported aminophosphine and bis-aminophosphine compounds (from now
on pnpRu) as potential chemotherapeutic agents (Figure 2).11 Some of the
complexes displayed high in vitro antiproliferative activity in a
series of cell lines, including the platinum-resistant A2780R. Given
that a small library of such aminophosphine ligands could be rapidly
obtained, this preliminary study highlighted the potential utility
of this scaffold as an easily-tunable core in metallodrug discovery.
Herein, we aimed to explore the potential of the lead pnpRu complexes
as chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer. We focused on this tumor
type as there are limited therapeutic options mainly in the advanced
stage. We report here on the screening and preliminary biochemical
and biological studies of the lead pnpRu-14 compound
in breast cancer therapy to provide solid support for further preclinical
development of selected amino- and bis-aminosphosphine (pnp) Ru-based
metallodrug candidates.

reported.11

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Antiproliferative
Studies in Vitro
The cationic ruthenium complexes pnpRu-14 and pnpRu-15 were chosen as lead compounds because
of the high
cytotoxicity they displayed against the tumor cells screened in the
previous work.11 Specifically, pnpRu-14 was active against the Pt-resistant cell line A2780R with IC50 =
2.2 μM, while for the ferrocene containing pnpRu-15 (see Figure 2) this
value was 3.1 μM. Moreover, these two compounds were somewhat
less toxic toward noncancerous rat primary astrocytes and against
HEK-293 cells.

The antitumoral properties of the lead pnp-Ru
compounds pnpRu-14 and pnpRu-15 in comparison
with the well-studied RAPTA-C analogue were assayed by monitoring
the ability of these ruthenium complexes to inhibit cell growth using
the MTT assay, which allows the determination of mitochondrial functionality
in various types of breast malignancies, including HER2+ (SKBR3 and
BT474 cancer cells) and HR+/HER2– (T47D and MCF7 cancer cells)
breast cancer (Figure 3A).

Figure 3 pnp-Ru14 has an inhibitory effect on breast cancer cells. (A) MCF7,
T47D, BT474, and SKBR3 were exposed to pnpRu-14, RAPTA-C,
and pnpRu-15 for 72 h at the indicated concentrations.
Metabolization of MTT was determined by spectrophotometry. ANOVA was
used to determine significant statistical differences. (B) MTT metabolization
of cells exposed at the indicated concentrations of pnp-Ru14 compared
with same concentrations of carboplatin (Carbo.) and cisplatin (Cis.)
treatment for 72 h. (C) Effect of the combination of herceptin (Herc.
10 nM) with the indicated concentrations of pnpRu-14 for
72 h, in HER2+ breast cancer cells lines (BT474, and SKBR3). p < 0.05, *p < 0.01, **p < 0.001***.

While good levels of
cytotoxicity (superior to those of RAPTA)
were observed for the ferrocene-based pnpRu-15, pnpRu-14 was found to be particularly effective, reducing
significantly the viability in all tumor cells screened. Importantly,
inhibition of cell proliferation with pnpRu-14 took place
in a concentration-dependent manner.

Among the currently used
chemotherapeutics, platinum complexes
are held in high regard. In several tumors like testicular cancer,
nonsmall-cell lung cancer, or bladder cancer, the platinum therapy
is well established. It is also used in combination with other chemotherapeutic
agents in the treatment of some subtypes of breast cancer such as
triple negative.12 Therefore, the cytotoxicity
of the lead compound pnpRu-14 was compared, once again
via the MTT assay, with the clinically used metallodrugs cisplatin
and carboplatin against a panel of breast cancer cell lines (Figure 3B). Gratifyingly,
the pnpRu-14 was 8-fold more efficient at inhibiting
the growth of SKBR3 and BT474 cells, and 4-fold more efficient at
T47D and MCF7, than cisplatin or carboplatin. Additionally, pnpRu-14 showed a concentration-dependent profile in T47D
and MCF7 in contrast to carboplatin and cisplatin (Figure 3B). The outstanding potency
of pnpRu-14, particularly in the MCF7 and the BT474 cell
lines, suggested that this compound may constitute a promising drug
lead candidate suitable for further testing. In addition, the administration
of the compound increased the reduction of the % MTT transformed of
the anti-HER2 antibody Herceptin in SKBR3, particularly at higher
doses (Figure 3C).

2.2 PnpRu-14 Induces Cell Cycle Arrest
at G1 on Cell Cycle
Aiming to shed light on the suppression
of cancer cell proliferation by pnpRu-14, the mechanism
implied was further investigated (Figure 4A). For this purpose, the two hormone receptor
positive cell lines, MCF7, T47D and the two HER2+ cell lines, and
SKBR3 and BT474, were treated with pnpRu-14 for 24 h
and DNA staining with propidium iodide/RNAse was performed. Addition
of pnpRu-14 to four cell lines increased the percentage
of cells in G0/G1, although for T47D did not reach a statistical significant
level (Figure 4A).
A concomitant decrease of cells in the G2/M phase was also observed.
The biochemical analyses demonstrated a reduction of Cyclin E and
D in T47D, BT474, and SKBR3, indicative of an arrest in G1, thus confirming
the results observed with flow cytometry (see Figure 4B and statistical analysis in Figure S3 in Supporting Information).

Figure 4 pnpRu-14 leads to cell cycle arrest in G0/G1. (A)
Cell cycle progression was evaluated by flow cytometry after 24 h
of pnpRu-14 treatment, using propidium iodide DNA staining.
Histograms show the mean percentage of cells in different phases of
the cell cycle. Student t test was used to determine
significant statistical differences; (B) expression of cyclin E, D1,
B, and p27 proteins was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Calnexin
was used as a control. p < 0.05, *p < 0.01, **p < 0.001***.

In addition to the effects of pnpRu-14 on the
cell
cycle, we also explored the possibility that the compound can be responsible
for cell death (Figures 5 and S1 in Supporting Information). The
treatment with 1 μM of pnpRu-14-augmented Annexin
V staining of MCF7, BT474 and SKBR3 cells, and did not modify AV+
staining (Figure 5A).
Clear indications of apoptosis were observed in three cell lines,
MCF7, BT474 and SKBR3. Degradation of PARP was only identified in
BT474 cell lines in line with an increase of caspase 3 demonstrating
that in this particular cell line, cell death was mediated by activation
of caspases (Figure 5B,C). A similar effect, but to a less extent was observed in MCF7
and SKBR3. Finally, phosphorylation of H2AX was observed in SKBR3,
indicative of an induction of DNA damage. Taken together, these results
demonstrate that pnpRu-14 inhibits proliferation by more
than one target, including via cell cycle arrest and the induction
of apoptosis, and this effect is cell-dependent.

Figure 5 pnpRu-14 provokes apoptotic cell death in breast cancer
cells. (A) MCF7, T47D, BT474, and SKBR3 were exposed to pnpRu-14 4 at the indicated concentration for 48 h. Then, Annexin V binding
was evaluated by flow cytometry. Histograms represent the mean percentage
of Annexin V positive (AV+) or negative (AV-8) cells. Student t test was used to determine significant statistical differences.
(B) Western blot evaluation of PARP cleavage and H2AX phosphorylation
(pH2AX) on MCF7, T47D, BT474, and SKBR3 upon 48 h pnpRu-14 treatment. Calnexin was used as a control. (C) Determination of
Caspase 3 activity in cells treated as in B. p <
0.05, *p < 0.01, **p < 0.001***.

2.3 Reactivity
with Biomolecules
The
mechanisms by which ruthenium-based drugs exert their toxicity effects
remain to be fully elucidated. In order to understand the molecular
bases, several computational physicochemical for the lead compound pnpRu-14 were evaluated by DFT calculations (Table S1 in Supporting Information). Some of these parameters
are frequently used in quantitative structure-activity relationship
methods (Table 1).13 As was expected, the lipophilicity of pnpRu-14 based on the calculated α and SASA values was
lower than that of cisplatin. For cisplatin, the limiting step in
the mechanism of the cytotoxicity induction is generally attributed
to the hydrolysis of the Pt–Cl bonds.14 DFT studies indicated a more favorable solvation (ΔGsolv) of pnpRu-14 than cisplatin,
which may lead to a more favorable subsequent hydrolysis. This fact
may be consistent with the high cytotoxicity of pnpRu-14 in case DNA would be the main target. Hence, as has already been
observed with other Ru-based metallodrugs, it might point to a differential
mode of action of pnpRu-14 with respect to that of cisplatin.

It is very well-known the high affinity to DNA of
most platinum
metallodrugs.15 However, NAMI-A is known
to have weaker interactions with DNA than cisplatin, whereas KP1019
undergoes interactions similar to cisplatin. RAPTA derivatives exhibit
pH-dependent DNA damage. Although DNA is known as a major target for
metallodrugs, the environment of the nucleic acids, especially the
protein regions of chromatin also appears to be an important target.16 Histone H1 is a lysine-rich histone fraction
of chromatin and its role as DNA linker might modulate the binding
of any drug to DNA. On the other hand, human serum albumin (HSA) can
bind most therapeutic drugs. It has been demonstrated that the distribution
and the metabolism of drugs can be significantly altered because of
their binding to this protein. Regarding the binding studies to HSA,
higher affinity by certain ruthenium antitumoral agents has been observed
compared to those of cisplatin.17

To get further insights into the pharmacological properties at
the molecular level, information about the affinity of pnpRu-14 to DNA, HSA, and H1 histone were obtained by UV–vis absorption
and fluorescence spectroscopy studies. In a first step of the study,
DNA-binding studies by UV–vis spectroscopy with DNA were conducted
for pnpRu-14 and RAPTA-C (the study with cisplatin was
previously reported by our laboratory).18 The complex pnpRu-14 presented one intense absorption
band centered at 300 nm corresponding to the charge transfer between
Ru and the cymene moiety throughout the P atoms. The assignments of
the transitions were guided by the results from time-dependent TD-DFT
calculations (see Figure S2 in Supporting Information).

Figure 6A
shows
the plots of A0/(A0 – A) versus [compound]/[DNA] of pnpRu-14, RAPTA-C and cisplatin in the presence of DNA (eq 1). The binding constant, Ka values, were determined by linear regression,
and values are shown in Table 2. Additionally, the interaction of pnpRu-14,
RAPTA-C, and cisplatin with HSA and H1 histone was examined in fluorescence
quenching experiments (see Experimental Section). The binding constant, Ka values, were
determined by linear regression of a plot of (F0 – F/F) versus log[Q] (eq 4),
as shown in Figure 6B,C. Table 2 summarizes
the binding constants of pnpRu-14, RAPTA-C, and cisplatin
to DNA, HSA, and H1 histone.

The compounds interacted with DNA with binding constants, Ka, within 103–104 M–1, a magnitude comparable with those of metal complexes binding DNA
through noncovalent interactions.19 Based
on the molecular structure and positive charge of pnpRu-14, electrostatic interactions with DNA could be expected with the
negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA. However, considering that
the Ka value of the neutral complexes,
RAPTA-C and cisplatin were of similar magnitude, a different action
mechanism for its cytotoxicity could be involved. Examination of the
binding constants to the HSA and H1 proteins indicated a strong interaction
of the cationic pnpRu-14 with both proteins, whereas
the neutral compounds cisplatin and RAPTA-C show a significant lower
protein affinity. Remarkably, the binding affinity of pnpRu-14 toward H1 histones is two order of magnitude higher than RAPTA-C,
while the corresponding binding cisplatin and H1 is practically negligible.
This behavior is also appreciable when compared with the number of
H1 binding sites (n), 0.48 for cisplatin versus ≈1.18
for both Ru derivatives. This set of results supports preceding studies
in which histones and HSA proteins are good candidates for organometallics
ruthenium(II) complexes action.16,18b It seems that pnpRu-14 recognizes the chromatin structure with higher affinity
than free DNA and this fact could strongly influence in its mechanism
of action.

2.4 Pharmacokinetic and Biodistribution
Study
Accumulation and biodistribution are important factors
in drug
development. The pharmacokinetic and biodistribution for the drug
candidate pnpRu-14 were achieved by determining the content
of Ru in 19 nude mice after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration
of a single concentration of 5 mg kg–1. The mice
were sacrificed 0.1, 1.5, 4, 12, 36, and 48 h after injection. Serum,
liver, spleen, kidneys, heart, lungs, brain, prostate, ovary, and
reproductive organs were collected from each mouse and the Ru content
was determined by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry
(ICP–MS). The pharmacokinetic parameters of pnpRu-14 calculated in the 19 mice used for the in vivo study are displayed
in Table 3 and the
pharmacokinetic graphic in Figure 7A (see procedure in Experimental Section). pnpRu-14 was quickly absorbed into serum (t1/2abs = 0.5 h) and, after approximately 1.5
h, the peak serum concentration was reached. Then, pnpRu-14 was progressively eliminated from the blood compartment with an
elimination half-life greater than 12 h (Table 3). The tmax calculated
is faster than the tmax of 2.5 h found
for the biodistribution study on KP-1339/IT139, although it should
be noted that in the latter study, a concentration of 40 mg kg–1 was used.20 The elimination
half-life of pnpRu-14 is similar to compounds RAPTA-C,9 NAMI-A,21 and KP1019,22 previously reported. When the total area under
the concentration–time curve (AUCtotal) was analyzed,
7.91% of the AUC was extrapolated from the last timepoint at 48 h,
thus enhancing the confidence on the data calculated for AUC, volume
of distribution (Vd), and apparent clearance
(Clapp).

Comparison with RAPTA-C
studies9 indicate
a higher Vd which could be attributed
to a higher solubility of pnpRu-14 or a higher affinity
to plasma proteins. Serum concentration at 12 h after the injection
was 28.4 ± 10.7 ng mL–1, which is lower than
the Cmax thus suggesting a low tissue
accumulation of pnpRu-14. Similar results were reported
for water-soluble iminophosphorane ruthenium(II) compounds.23 The results could support the binding studies
reported above, in which pnpRu-14 showed a higher affinity
to HSA than RAPTA-C and cisplatin.

It is noteworthy that ruthenium
was found to specifically accumulate
not only in liver and kidneys, the organs related to biotransformation,
and elimination of exogenous compounds such as pnpRu-14 but also relatively high concentrations were detected in reproductive
organs such as prostate, ovary, fallopian tubes as well as in the
afferent and efferent ducts (Figure 7B). Nevertheless, the number of female subjects analyzed
is reduced to establish a hypothesis related to a potential activity
toward these tissues, also considering the remarkable occurrence of
interindividual variability.

On the contrary, the lowest levels
of the compound were detected
in lungs and heart. As expected, the organ samples taken from the
animals sacrificed within 90 min after administration contained the
highest levels of Ru, except for ovary and lungs, and slightly higher
levels (approx. 3-fold) were observed in kidneys and liver only 1.5
h after injection. As in similar works, the concentration of pnpRu-14 in kidneys was remarkably higher than in the spleen,10 whereas RAED-C pharmacokinetic studies revealed
the highest levels of the compound associated with the liver and kidneys,24,25 a phenomenon also observed for pnpRu-14. This phenomenon, together with the moderate clearance
and relative short half-life calculated would indicate a considerably
high rate of elimination of pnpRu-14 through liver metabolism
and/or renal clearance. Moreover, the decrease of pnpRu-14 levels in kidney between 1.5 and 12 h after dosing will indicate
that a significant amount of pnpRu-14 is being excreted
by glomerular filtration, while a second peak is observed in kidneys
12 h after the injection, possibly because of a second elimination
step of pnpRu-14 previously accumulated in several organs,
such as the reproductive system or the prostate.

Over time,
the Ru concentration was detected in all tissues analyzed,
paralleling the total Ru levels in serum, except for the brain, in
which levels below the limit of quantification of the ICP–MS
methodology or no Ru was detected for any of the timepoints analyzed.
This observation might be related to the low potential of this hydrophilic
and charged drug compound to cross the blood–brain barrier.
Nevertheless, the rapid elimination of pnpRu-14 from
the organs analyzed and the bloodstream, partly because of its charged
nature, would indicate the potential absence of serious side effects.

3 Conclusions
Chemotherapy is one of the most
potent strategies to treat cancer.
However, many limitations do exist including the identification and
selection of a specific subgroup of responsive patients. This work
is focused on the validation of an organometallic ruthenium(II) complex, pnpRu-14, as a novel anticancer drug for breast cancer therapy.
Overall, pnpRu-14 exhibits a marked antitumoral activity
in vitro against HER2+ and RH+/HER2– breast cancer, associated
with low toxicity and favorable clearance properties. Initial mechanistic
studies indicate a caspase-dependent apoptosis with cycle arrest in
the G0/G1 phase cells. The interaction of pnpRu-14 with
DNA is weak and electrostatic in nature and strong with HSA and H1
histones in comparison with the reference metallodrugs, RAPTA-C, and
cisplatin. Pharmacokinetic studies show a quick absorption in plasma
with an elimination half-life similar to that reported for other ruthenium
derivatives. Importantly, pnpRu-14 is not significantly
accumulated in any tested organs. The simple accessible synthesis
of this compound and its preliminary biological activity in vitro
makes pnpRu-14 a good candidate for further evaluation
in vivo as a potential chemotherapeutic agent against breast cancer.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of Compounds
Compounds
RAPTA-C, pnpRu-14, and pnpRu-15 were prepared
as previously described.11 Cisplatin was
obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.

4.2 Cell
Culture pnpRu-14
The positive hormonal receptor
cell lines T47D and MCF7 and the HER2+
cell line BT474 and SKBR3 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC; CCL-227) (Manassas, VA). All lines were maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum, supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL
streptomycin, and 5 mM l-glutamine, and grown in incubators
at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell culture mediums and supplements
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Carboplatin, cisplatin,
and herceptin were purchased from Accord Healthcare (United Kingdom.
MA).

4.3 MTT Metabolization Assays
For concentration
response and synergy studies, T47D, MCF7, BT474, and SKBR3 were plated
at a density of 10 000 cells per well in 48-multiwell plates.
The following day, cells were treated with different doses of the
drugs (pnpRu-14, RAPTA-C, pnpRu-15, carboplatin,
and cisplatin), alone or in combination (RU14 and herceptin), for
three days (72 h).

4.4 Cell Cycle and Apoptosis
Assay
For
cell cycle analyses, T47D, MCF7, BT474, and SKBR3 were plated at 100 000
cells per well in 6-multiwell plates. The following day, cells were
treated with pnpRu-14 (1 μM) during 24 h. Then,
cells were tripsinized, centrifuged at 800g 5 min,
and supernatant was discarded. Cells were fixed and permeabilized
with 300 μL of cold-ice ethanol [70% in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS)] for 30 min; then, 700 μL of a BSA solution (2% BSA in
PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used to wash cells and avoid
aggregate formation. Then, cell pellets were incubated with propidium
iodide/RNAse staining solution (Immunostep S.L., Salamanca, Spain).
Cell cycle was analyzed in a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

For apoptosis analyses, 100 000 cells were treated with pnpRu-14 (1 μM) for 48 h. Then, cells and supernatants
were collected and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 min. Pellets were
resuspended in 1X Annexin V binding buffer (Immunostep S.L., Salamanca,
Spain) and incubated for 1 hour in the dark with Annexin V and PI
staining solution (2.5 μL Annexin V-DY-634, 8 μL of PI
[2 mg/mL final concentration], 300 μL binding buffer, Immunostep
S.L). Percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using a FACSCanto
II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Both early (Annexin V-positive,
PI-negative) and late apoptotic (Annexin V-positive and PI-positive)
cells were included in cell death analyses.

4.5 Western
Blot
T47D, MCF7, BT474, and
SKBR3 cells were treated with pnpRu-14 (1 μM) for
24 and 48 h. Then, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with ice-cold
lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.0], 140 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 10%
glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μM pepstatin, 1 μg/mL aprotinin,
1 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, and
1 mM sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were centrifuged at 10 000g at 4 °C for 10 min and the clarified cell extracts
were quantified with BCA (Bicinchoninic Acid Kit for Protein Determination,
BCA1-1KT Sigma-Aldrich) Protein extracts (80 μg) loaded in on
6–15% SDS-PAGE gels, depending on the molecular weight of the
proteins to be analyzed. After electrophoresis, proteins in gels were
transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore Corporation). Membranes were
blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween (TBST) (100 mM Tris
[pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% of bovine
serum albumin for 2 h and, then, incubated with the corresponding
antibody in TBST for 2–16 h. After washing with TBST, membranes
were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary
antibodies (1:10 000 dilution) for 30 min and bands were visualized
by using ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).

Antibodies against cyclin
E, cyclin D1, p27, and pH2AX were from Cell Signaling Technologies
(Beverly, MA, USA). Antibodies against PARP and cyclin B were from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The rabbit polyclonal
anti-calnexin was obtained from Stressgen Bioreagents (Victoria, BC,
Canada), anti-Rabbit from Bio-Rad and anti-Mouse is from GE Healthcare.

4.6 Caspase 3 Assay
Fifty micrograms
of protein extracts from pnpRu-14 48 h-treated cells
were placed in 96-well plates in triplicate. The final volume of the
lysates was taken to 100 μL by 1× Caspase buffer (25 mM
HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose). One
hundred μL of 2× caspase reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES pH
7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.2% CHAPS, 20% sucrose, 20 mM DTT, and
10 μM fluorescently labelled caspase 3 substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC)
was added to each well containing cell lysates. The plate was shaken
to mix the solution and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h from light.
Signals were measured at 400/505 nm in a fluorescent reader (BioTek).

4.7 In Vivo Studies
To study the pharmacokinetics
and biodistribution of pnpRu-14 in vivo, BALB/cAnNR1-Fox1
nu/Fox 1 nude mice (male and female, 10 weeks old, body weight 16–27
g) were utilized. A 2:1 ratio between female and male animals was
established at each experimental group, except for the control and
48 h group. Animal care complied with the Principles of Laboratory
Animal Care and Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
The selected dose (5 mg/kg) of pnpRu-14 was intraperitoneally
administered into the animals, which were divided into seven groups:
(i) vehicle control group (n = 2), (ii) 30 min post-treatment
(n = 3), (iii) 90 min (n = 3), (iv)
4 h (n = 3), (v) 12 h (n = 3), (vi)
36 h (n = 3), and (vii) 48 h post-treatment (n = 2), respectively. First, blood was drawn from each animal
in different tubes containing EDTA, and then centrifuged at 1500g by 10 min to obtain the serum aliquots required for the
pharmacokinetic analysis. These samples were then stored at −80
°C until ICP–MS analysis. Furthermore, liver, kidneys,
spleen, lungs, heart, brain, and reproductive organs were collected
at the indicated times to determine the biodistribution of pnpRu-14. In this case, these samples were lyophilized to homogenize them
and for their preservation.

4.8 Statistical Analysis
To determine
significant statistical and fully understand group differences, to
equal variances Tukey’s test was used with ANOVA, respectively,
and to compare the media of results, Student t test
was used. The values for the statistical analyses are: *, p ≤ 0.05; **, p ≤ 0.01; ***, p ≤ 0.001.

4.9 Sample Preparation
Ruthenium content
in explanted organs (i.e., liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, heart, brain,
prostate, and reproductive system) from mice treated with pnpRu-14 or PBS solution were evaluated by ICP–MS. Additionally, the
serum content of this metal was measured at fractions collected 0.5,
1.5, 4, 12, 36, and 48 h after administering the dose of pnpRu-14.

Optimized digestion of samples was carried out in a microwave
digestor (Ethos Plus Microwave Labstation, Milestone Inc., Monroe,
CT, USA) by placing 50 μL of serum, or a fragment of each organ
specimen previously weighed, in a Teflon digestion vessel where 2
mL of 20% HNO3 (diluted from 69% purity HNO3) was added. The vessels were closed, and the samples digested with
125 W of power per vessel using a four-stage program (stage 1 heating
to 200 °C for 5 min; stage 2 holding at 200 °C for 5 min;
stage 3 heating to 220 °C for 5 min; and a final step of 5 min
at 220 °C). Then, the vessels were allowed to cool to room temperature
for 15 min prior to opening the vessels. Digested solutions were then
adjusted with ultrapure water to obtain a 10 mL solution with the
correct acid concentration to perform the analysis. All the solutions
were prepared using ultrapure water obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q
system.

4.10 Sample Analysis
The quantitative
analysis of ruthenium in the processed samples was carried out by
ICP–MS using a 7900 Series (G8403A) Agilent ICP–MS instrument
(Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) equipped with a MicroMist glass concentric
nebulizer, a quartz Scott-type double pass-cooled spray chamber, and
SPS 4 autosampler. The metal content was determined by flow injection
analysis under the following operating conditions: power 1550 W, carrier
gas 0.99 L min–1, make-up gas 0.00 L min–1, sample depth 10 mm, nebulizer pump 0.1 rps and spray chamber temperature
2 °C. The ICP–MS instrument was operated in helium collision
mode for unsurpassed interference removal. A typical performance test
in He mode is as follows: He flux 5 mL/min, m/z 7 (327 cps), m/z 89
(2542 cps), m/z 205 (481 cps). Every
sample contained 0.5 ng mL–1 erbium as internal
standard for ICP–MS measurements and all determinations were
conducted by monitoring the 101Ru signal. Serum from control
mice was spiked with the test compound to determine the extraction
efficiency.

The ICP–MS instrument was tuned using a solution
containing 1 μg mL–1 each of Ce, Co, Li, Mg,
Tl and Y (Agilent), and calibration curves were obtained using aqueous
standard solutions in identical matrix to the samples (with regard
to internal standard and 2% nitric acid) with appropriate stock standards
dilutions (Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland).

4.11 Affinity
Studies
4.11.1 Materials and General Procedure
Salmon sperm DNA was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich in 10 g L–1 aliquot. A stock solution of 1300 μM was prepared by dissolving
the sample in 0.02 M Bis–Tris buffer solutions at pH 7.4 containing
0.1 M NaCl. Bis–Tris (Sigma) and NaCl (Panreac) had a purity
of no <99.0%. Water was purified in a Milli-RO System (Millipore)
and stored at −10 °C. The nucleotide DNA concentration
was determined spectrophotometrically.24 The ratio A260/A280 for this solution was >1.8.26

HSA (≥99%) and H1 histone (%) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.
For HSA and H1 binding experiments, working solutions of proteins
(5 μM) were daily prepared in buffer solution. Stock solutions
of pnpRu-14 and RAPTA-C of 180 and 216 μM, respectively,
were prepared by dissolving the sample in methanol while cisplatin
stock solution (330 μM) was obtained by dissolving the compound
in DMSO.

4.11.2 DNA-Binding Studies
by UV–Vis Spectroscopy
Absorbance spectra were recorded
on an ETCR-762 (Jasco) spectrophotometer
in a 10 × 10 mm quartz cuvette operating at 1 nm resolution.
Titration experiments were performed at constant concentration of
metallodrugs in the sample cell. Stock DNA was added in increasing
amounts (0–200 μM) to the sample cell containing 3 mL
of a solution 10 μM of drugs in buffer and 3 mL of the solution
of buffer in the reference cell. The decrease in the absorption at
λmax was measured after each addition. The binding
constants were then determined according to the Benesi–Hildebrand
equation.27 1  where Ka is the
binding constant, εG and εHG are
the absorption coefficients of the coordination compound and the coordination
compound/DNA complex, respectively. Three experiments were carried
out for each compound (Table 2).

4.11.3 Protein Binding Studies
by Steady-State
Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Fluorescence spectra of the samples
were recorded by means of a FS5 (Edinburgh Instruments) spectrofluorometer
equipped with a time-correlated single photon counting detector. As
a light source, a Xe lamp of 150 W was employed to record the steady-state
fluorescence spectra. In the protein (HAS, H1)/metallodrug binding
experiments, 3 mL protein solutions (5 μM) were titrated in
cuvette by successive addition of a metallodrug stock solutions. The
excitation wavelengths were 295 and 283 nm for H1 and HSA, respectively,
whereas the emission fluorescence intensities were collected at 330
and 372 nm, respectively. The excitation and emission slits were fixed
at 1 and 5 nm, respectively. The step and dwell times were 1 nm and
0.1 s, respectively. For the inner filter effect fluorescence was
corrected through 2  where Fcorr and Fobs are the corrected and observed
fluorescence
intensities, and Aexc and Aem are the absorbance of the system at excitation and
emission wavelengths. Temperature was controlled at 300 K by a temperature-controlled
cuvette holder, TC 125 (Quantum Northwest) and the experiment was
repeated three times.

The Stern–Volmer equation was then
used to evaluate the quenching constant KSV of the studied drug–protein systems 3  where F0 and F are the
emission intensities in the absence and the presence
of the quencher, respectively, [Q] is the concentration
of the quencher (metallodrug), and KSV is the Stern–Volmer constant.28

For static quenching, the relationship between fluorescence
intensity
and the quencher concentration, [Q], is described
by the following equation 4  where F0 corresponds
to the fluorescence intensity of the protein in the absence of quencher, n and Ka are the number of binding
sites and binding constant, respectively.29−31

4.11.4 Computational Methodology
The
Gaussian09 (Rev. C.01) software package was used to carry out the
theoretical calculations,32 and the hybrid
density functional B3LYP method employed to generate geometries. The
effective core potential LANL2DZ was used to describe Ru atoms and
the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set was employed for the other atoms.33,34 The solvation model based on density was employed to include solvent
effects.35

HOMO and LUMO energies,
dipole moments, and polarizabilities were calculated at the B3LYP
level in the gas phase. Solvent-accessible surface areas and molecular
volumes were extracted from calculations in aqueous solution. Solvation
free energies of the chloride compound were obtained as the difference
of their free energies in water solution and in the gas phase. Electronic
transitions were analyzed at the time-dependent (TD)-B3LYP level for
the solvated molecules.
