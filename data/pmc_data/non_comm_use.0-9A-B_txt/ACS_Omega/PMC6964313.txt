Here, a hydrophilic
fumed silica (F-SiO2) was used as
a support, and we place phosphotungstic acid (HPW) onto the F-SiO2 via a simple impregnation method normally used to prepare
a HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst, which is used in oxidative desulfurization
processes. A number of characterization analyses were used, such as
X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and Transmission electron
microscopy, to prove that the HPW catalyst was homogeneously distributed
on the F-SiO2. The structural parameters of the catalyst
and the support were tested with Brunauer–Emmett–Teller,
and it was confirmed that the catalyst is a mesoporous material. Energy-dispersive
spectrometry was used to characterize the distribution of the active
component distribution. Catalytic performance was investigated using
the catalytic oxidative desulfurization process. During optimal conditions,
the removal effect of dibenzothiophene (DBT) in simulated oil can
reach 100%. After 13 cycles, catalytic activity is still high, and
the DBT conversion can still attain 95.362%.

1 Introduction
The main components of
acid rain are the sulfur oxides produced
via fuel combustion. The formation of acid rain can lead to serious
environmental pollution, destroy ecosystems, and endanger human health.
Therefore, the deep desulfurization of fuel oil has gradually become
an urgent environmental issue and requires a solution.1 Hydrodesulfurization is a relatively developed technology
that can remove the majority of sulfides. However, because of steric
hindrance, the removal effect of heterocyclic sulfides and their derivatives
is not effective. Therefore, previous studies have developed various
desulfurization technologies, such as adsorption,2 extraction,3,4 and oxidative desulfurization
(ODS). Among these methods, the ODS process is one of the most promising
because of advantages with mild reaction conditions, simple operation
processes, and highly efficient desulfurization.

Excellent desulphurization
effect required specific catalysts.
Among the various catalysts,5−8 heteropolyacids, characterized by a Keggin structure,
have attracted significant attention for catalysis applications, such
as in sulfur-containing compounds.9 In
the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide, the HPW peroxidized and
decomposed to generate an anionic peroxide metal complex W(O2)n, which provides an active site for
ODS.10 However, homogeneous heteropolyacid
catalysts pose difficulties when attempting to separate them from
the ODS process. Thus, it is difficult to use them in industrial application.
In order to overcome these shortcomings, numerous previous studies
have attempted to immobilize HPW onto a support to increase the recycle
number.

Support selection should consider the properties and
structure
of the material, which includes the presence of a strong interaction
between the support and HPW to ensure that HPW loads onto the support.
Xiao et al.11 prepared a HPW/AC (activated
carbon) catalyst using activated carbon as a support. In the simulated
oil system, they studied the thiophene removal effect, and a high
thiophene conversion can be reached to 90% at 363 K after 2 h. Catalyst
pore size is only 1.95 nm, which affects HPW loading and mass transfer
during the reaction process, resulting in a relatively long reaction
time. Yang et al.12 loaded HPW using multistage
porous silica as a support to the ODS of fuel oil. At 333 K and 0.1
g catalyst, O/S = 12, the reaction conversion can reach to 100%, after
2 h, but after the catalyst is recovered seven times, the desulfurization
effect dropped to below 96.2%. Although the catalyst has a large specific
surface area and high activity, the catalyst pore diameter is only
5.1 nm. This type of structure leads to an unevenly distributed HPW,
which results in excessive loading of the active component. In addition,
the reaction time was still 2 h with a large amount of hydrogen peroxide.
Yue et al.13 also studied HPW loading onto
silica with multistage pores, which not only maintains a high specific
surface area but also provides pore structures with different sizes
to improve catalyst performance. Under the optimal conditions, the
dibenzothiophene (DBT) removal can reach to 99.8% but dropped to 95.1%
after eight cycles. The results indicate an enhancement of catalyst
stability. However, there are few active sites exposed on the surface
are few, which does not successfully reduce the load. In order to
solve this problem, we studied the application of various supports
in ODS. In our previous studies, we studied the applications of catalysts
to improve the catalyst recovery capacity during ODS, such as HPW/NH2-MCM-4114 and HPW/mpg-C3N415 in ODS reactions. Amino
modification of the MCM-41 molecular sieve enhances the interaction
between HPW and the support, and this interaction reduces the loss
of HPW during the reaction. The amino modification reduced the amount
of catalyst and reduced the amount of HPW. The HPW/NH2-MCM-41
catalyst did not significantly decline the catalytic performance.
However, the HPW load remains as high as 20 wt %. HPW/mpg-C3N4 was prepared via the impregnation method using a mesoporous
graphite carbonitride material as the support. The HPW/mpg-C3N4 catalyst is reusable (15 cycles) without a significant
change of catalytic activity, indicating a significant improvement
in catalyst stability. Although catalyst pore size increases to 10.6
nm, HPW is prone to agglomeration because of their smaller specific
surface areas. Therefore, large loads still remain a problem. Huang
et al.16 prepared a HPW/NOLC catalyst by
doping nitrogen into an onion-like carbon (NOLC) support. The catalyst
not only has a higher specific surface area but has also a pore size
of 11.38 nm, which allows the HPW to disperse more efficiently on
the support. A HPW/NOLC catalyst (10 wt %) can achieve 100% desulfurization
effect in simulated oil within 2 h. However, the support preparation
process is complex and uses an expensive diamond carbon source. At
the same time, because of the small specific surface area of the catalyst,
HPW is prone to agglomeration and cannot be industrially produced.

Therefore, we must choose a support that has a large specific surface
area and a strong binding force with HPW. Hydrophilic F-SiO2 is an inert carrier characterized by a low bulk density, large specific
surface area, and suitable wetting properties.17 F-SiO2 can form a stable suspension in water,18 and the addition of F-SiO2 can improve
solution properties, thereby a solution wettability and surface energy
increase.19,20 HPW is also very soluble in water. These
special properties allow the effective dispersion of HPW onto the
surface of the F-SiO2 during the impregnation process with
a strong bonding force. A simple impregnation method allows the loading
of HPW onto the F-SiO2. The HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst
not only has a high activity at low loading but also has high stability.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalyst Characterization
Figure 1 displays
the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns for the F-SiO2, HPW, and HPW/F-SiO2 samples with different HPW contents (10–50 wt %).
In Figure 1, the diffraction
peak of F-SiO2 was observed at 2θ = 21.7°, which
proves that the support is amorphous silica.21 This diffraction peak also exists in the four other HPW/F-SiO2 catalysts. The characteristic diffraction peak of HPW was
not observed for 10–30 wt % catalysts with different loads,
which indicates that the amount of active component HPW loaded onto
the F-SiO2 support is relatively small. However, the characteristic
diffraction peaks of HPW at 25.72, 35.18, 38.24, 53.59, and 60.21°
were clearly observed in the 50 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst,
indicating that HPW was successfully supported on the F-SiO2 support.

Figure 2 shows the
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the HPW, F-SiO2, and HPW/F-SiO2 samples. The characteristic peaks of
the HPW were observed with the Keggin structure at 1077, 983, 896,
and 810 cm–1, which are attributed to the stretching
vibrations of the P–O, W–O, W–Ob–W, and
W–Oc–W in HPW. These results are consistent with the
results reported in previous studies.22 The peaks at 3423 and 1632 cm–1 correspond to
the peak of the hydrogen-bonded OH group on the surface of the adsorbed
water. In particularly, we did not clearly observe the P–O
band of HPW and the weakening of characteristic peaks of HPW in the
HPW/F-SiO2 samples because of broad Si–O–Si
band coverage. With the increase of load, the characteristic peak
of HPW becomes more and more obvious. The weakening characteristic
peak of HPW at 983 cm–1 (telescopic vibration of
W=O bond in WO6 octahedron) still exists in the
FTIR spectrum of the 50 wt % HPW/SiO2 catalyst. At 896
cm–1 (W–Ob–W Bridge oxygen bond vibration)
and 810 cm–1 (W–Oc–W Bridge oxygen
bond vibration), the absorption peak gradually increases with the
increase of the load, which suggests that the HPW Keggin structures
were loaded onto the F-SiO2 support successfully.23 At the same time, a force was generated between
HPW and the carrier, consistent with the XRD characterization results.

% HPW/F-SiO2, (d) 20 wt % HPW/F-SiO2, (e) 50
wt % HPW/SiO2, and (f) HPW.

The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms for the F-SiO2 and HPW/F-SiO2 samples with varying HPW contents
are shown in Figure 3A. Together, the five samples represent a type-IV adsorption isotherm
characteristic of a type-H1 hysteresis loop with a relative pressure
ranging from 0.8 to 1.0. These characteristics indicate that the F-SiO2 support has a mesoporous structure, and the mesoporous structure
still exists after loading the HPW.22Figure 3B shows the pore
size distribution curves for the 10 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 sample.
The average pore size is approximately 36 nm, which is consistent
with the pore size of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET). Figure 3C displays the F-SiO2 particle size distribution. The wide particle size distribution
is because of the clustering of the silica particles, which reduces
the bulk density of the support forming fluffy large particles, such
that HPW is more dispersed and fixed on the surface of the F-SiO2.24Table 1 lists the sample physio-chemical structure
parameters. Based on the data in the table, the catalyst specific
surface area decreased gradually with an increasing load. As the loading
increases, the specific surface area of the catalyst decreases slightly
mainly because the HPW-loaded support surface occupies a certain surface,
but it has a specific surface area, so the decrease is small. The
pore volume and size of the HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst are more
than twice those of the pure carrier. This is mainly because the fumed
silica has strong cohesiveness, a gel is formed during the preparation
of the catalyst, and the silica particles are bonded to each other.
The particle deposits cause a sharp increase in pore volume and pore
size and also increase the specific surface area, which is one of
the reasons why the loading amount increases and the specific surface
area of the catalyst does not change much. The larger specific surface
area permits a high dispersion of HPW on the support surface, and
the larger mesoporous pore size accelerates mass transfer in the reaction
process. Thus, catalysts with low loading can attain a high activity
in the ODS process.

To demonstrate the high HPW active component dispersion
on the
F-SiO2 surface, we tested HPW dispersion on the support.
As Figure 4 shows,
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses indicate that the
HPW did not agglomerate on the F-SiO2 surface, which suggests
that HPW is highly dispersed along the F-SiO2 support surface.
To verify these results, the dispersion of P and W element in the
HPW is uniform on the F-SiO2 surface using high-resolution
energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) elemental maps. These analyses
further illustrate the uniform dispersion of HPW on the F-SiO2 support.

2.2 Catalytic
Reactivity
We performed
the desulfurization process in simulated oil, which is obtained by
dissolving DBT in n-octane. From Figure 5, the sulfur removal effect
improves significantly after HPW is loaded onto the support. The DBT
conversion for 10 wt % HPW/F-SiO2, 20 wt % HPW/F-SiO2, and 30 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 is nearly 100%. The DBT
removal effect for the 5 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst is not
complete because of a low level of loading, which did not provide
a sufficient amount of active sites for the reaction. For a larger
load in the 30 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst, the load amount
induces active component agglomeration and reduces the catalyst specific
surface area, resulting in a lower desulfurization effect. The optimal
HPW load is 10 wt %, which is lower than previously reported in the
literature.12,13

Figure 5 DBT conversion in the ODS process with
varying HPW contents.

We optimized the various
reaction conditions, which include reaction
temperature, reaction time, catalyst dosage, and O/S, as shown in Figure 6. Figure 6A shows the relationship between
the DBT removal effect in simulated oil and the reaction temperature.
With an increase in temperature, the DBT conversion increases. The
sulfur removal increases rapidly between 303 and 313 K with no significant
changes after 313 K. When temperature reached 343 K, the DBT removal
effect decreased slightly because of the excessive temperature, which
caused the decomposition of H2O2 and a decrease
in the W(O2)n concentration.25 Consequently, the optimal reaction temperature
for the HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst is 313 K. The reaction temperature
in this experiment is lower than previously reported catalyst experiments. Figure 6B examines the relationship
between the DBT removal effect and reaction time. The DBT conversion
is nearly 100%. Within 1 h, the DBT had completely oxidized to sulfone
or sulfoxide, and the desulfurization effect became nearly stable
with time. Therefore, the optimal reaction time is 1 h. Compared with
previous studies, the reaction time required to obtain a 100% desulfurization
effect is shorter. As shown in Figure 6C, the O/S ratio has a significant impact on the DBT
removal. With an increase in the O/S molar ratio, the DBT desulfurization
effect increased until the O/S ratio increased to 4, after which the
desulfurization effect tended to remain stable. However, at an O/S
ratio of 12, the DBT conversion decreased slightly. This is possibly
because of an excessive amount of aqueous hydrogen peroxide attached
to the surface of the catalyst, which affects DBT adsorption on the
catalyst surface.26 However, the theoretical
O/S molar ratio for the oxidation of DBT to the corresponding sulfone
is 2, and the actual O/S molar ratio is greater than the theoretical
value because of a H2O2 component that has decomposed.
Therefore, the optimum O/S molar ratio is 4. Figure 6D shows that the DBT conversion increases
with an increase in the HPW/SiO2 catalyst dosage. When
the catalyst dosage was 0.06 g/10 mL, the desulfurization effect was
nearly 100%. This result indicates that the 0.06 g/10 mL catalyst
can provide a sufficient amount of active sites in the simulated oil.
Under the optimal conditions, the DBT desulfurization effect is near
100%, and compared with the previous catalyst, the catalyst prepared
in this experiment has higher activity. In summary, the optimal conditions
for this experiment are T = 313 K, t = 60 min, O/S = 4, and catalyst dosage = 0.06 g/10 mL.

mL, O/S = 10, t = 1 h). (B) Effects of reaction time

of catalyst dosage (t = 1 h, T =
313 K, O/S = 4).

Figure 7 compares
the catalytic activity for the various sulfides. The experimental
results show that the DBT conversion can attain 100% in 1 h, and the
benzothiophene (BT) conversion after 1 h of reaction is 73.91%, which
is because of the different sulfur atom electron density in various
sulfides. The sulfur atom electron density in DBT is 5.758, whereas
it is 5.739 in BT.27 Higher electron densities
more easily induce the oxidation of the sulfur atom. The electron
density of a sulfur atom in 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT)
is higher than the electron density of a sulfur atom in DBT. However,
the 4,6-DMDBT desulfurization effect in this experiment is lower than
the DBT removal. This deviation is possibly due to the fact that the
functional groups around the S atom hinder contact between the sulfur
atom and the catalytically active site. The electron density of the
sulfur atom of Th is 5.696, so the conversion of Th is the lowest. Figure 7 shows that the sulfur
removal for the sulfur-containing compounds, under the optimal reaction
conditions, follows the order DBT > 4,6-DMDBT > BT > Th.
Therefore,
the sulfur removal for the sulfur-containing compounds is not only
affected by the sulfur atom electron density but also by steric hindrance.

The DBT oxidation process is a quasi-first-order reaction that
conforms to the first-order reaction kinetic equation, as shown by eq 1. 1  

Based on the results shown in Figure 9A, we use eq 2 to obtain the reaction rate constant k. 2  

The reaction activation energy was calculated based on the
Arrhenius
equation, shown in eq 3. 3  

As is shown in Figure 8B, based on the Arrhenius equation, we calculated the apparent
activation energy of the 10 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst during
ODS to be 36.96 kJ mol–1. This result was slightly
lower than the previously reported value,13 which indicates that the 10 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst
had excellent catalytic activity during ODS.

rate model data at various temperatures
for catalyst 10 wt % HPW/F-SiO2. (B) Determination of reaction
activation energies.

The 10 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 was recycled, and the number
of cycles was determined, as shown in Figure 9. After the ODS reaction,
the catalyst was separated by filtration, dried at 353 K, and subjected
to the next desulfurization reaction. Figure 9 shows that, after the 11th cycle, the DBT
removal remains above 99%. After the 12th cycle, the DBT removal begins
to relatively small decrease. After 13 cycles, the DBT removal dropped
to 95.362%, which indicates that the 10 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst has excellent recyclability.

Figure 9 Effects of recycling
times on DBT conversion.

The HPW content of the
10 wt %HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst during
recycling was tested by inductively coupled plasma (ICP). Table 2 shows that the HPW
content in the fresh 10 wt %HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst is 4.86%.
The main reason is that it is impossible to completely enter the pore
structure of the carrier during the loading process. The HPW molecules
do not enter pores, causing the pores to block, which is also the
reason for the pore size bigger of the catalyst. With the increase
of the number of cycles, the content of HPW in the catalyst gradually
decreased, resulting in a decrease in catalytic performance. After
the 13th cycle, the content of HPW in the catalyst was 2.05%, and
the removal of DBT was reduced to 95.362%. The content of HPW in the
catalyst was reduced by 2.81%, indicating that the silica can effectively
fix the HPW, so that the catalyst has better stability.

Catalytic
performance decreases with the loss of the active component.
To investigate the loss of the active component, we performed a thermal
filtration experiment. When the reaction performed for 0.5 h, we filtered
out the catalyst to compare the desulfurization effect with the presence
of the 10 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst. As Figure 10 shows, the desulfurization
effect after filtration is significantly lower than in the case with
the presence of the 10 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst, indicating
that the loss of the active components in the catalyst is very small.

(A) With the presence of 10 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 as the catalyst,
and (B) 10 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 was heated filter for 0.5 h.

In the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide, HPW
peroxide decomposes
to form an anionic peroxide metal complex W(O2)n, which provides an active site for ODS. As shown
in Scheme 1, W=O
in the HPW molecule is converted from hydrogen peroxide to tungsten
peroxide and participates in the ODS reaction.

the HPW/F-SiO2 Catalyst
3 Conclusions
In summary, we successfully placed
the HPW, with a Keggin structure,
onto the F-SiO2 to prepare a simple and inexpensive HPW/F-SiO2 catalyst that is applied during the oxidation desulfurization
process. Large mesoporous channels promote mass transfer, and the
high specific surface area permits a more homogeneous distribution
of the active components, thus producing milder reaction conditions
and a more stable catalytic performance. During optimal reaction conditions,
the DBT desulfurization effect in simulated oil can reach 100% within
1 h. After recycling 12 times, the desulfurization effect had barely
decreased. After the 13 cycles, the catalytic activity began to decrease,
but the decline was relatively small, and the desulfurization effect
remained near 95.362%.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
F-SiO2 was purchased
from the Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. HPW (AR grade) was
supplied by the ChengDu KeLong Chemical Co., Ltd. DBT (99%) was supplied
by the J&K Scientific Company. Th (99%), BT (97%) and 4,6-DMDBT
(99%) were purchased from Aladdin. Acetone and methanol were purchased
from the Tianjin FuYu Chemical Co., Ltd. n-Octane
was supplied by the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All reagents
were used as received without any further modifications.

4.2 Synthesis of HPW/F-SiO2
The catalyst was
prepared via the impregnation method. First, we
dissolve 0.1 g HPW in 10 mL deionized water, and 1 g of F-SiO2 was added to the solution. We stirred this mixture for 24
h at room temperature. Solid samples were collected by filtration
and then dried at 353 K, and the catalyst was marked as 10 wt % HPW/F-SiO2. The 20 and 30 wt % HPW/F-SiO2 catalysts were
produced by changing HPW dosage.

4.3 Characterization
The catalyst specific
surface area and pore structure were tested with a Micromeritics for
ASAP-2460 Version 2.01 instrument using a low-temperature N2 physical adsorption method, during which a static method was used
for samples of N2 adsorption isotherms (77 K). Powder XRD
pattern data were acquired on a Bruker advanced D8 X-ray diffractometer
operating at 40 mA and 40 kV with Cu Kα irradiation (λ
= 0.15406 nm). FTIR spectroscopy was performed on a Nicolet AVATAR
360 spectrometer. TEM experiments were acquired using Tecnai G2 F20
S-TWIN (200 kV). TGA was performed on a Netzsch STA 449F3 analyzer
with a ramping rate of 10 K min–1 in an air flow
of 20 mL min–1. ICP experiments were tested on a
Thermo Scientific ICAP 6000 series ICP spectrometer.

4.4 Catalytic Performance Testing
DBT,
BT, Th, and 4,6-DMDBT were used raw materials for the model oil. We
tested catalyst desulphurization performance by using the above substances
as raw materials and dissolved them into 100 ppm model oil. Model
oil (10 mL) was poured into a 100 mL three-mouth flask, a quantitative
catalyst was added, and then dispersed via ultrasonication. The flask
was placed in a water bath, 36% hydrogen peroxide solution was added
at a specific O/S ratio under stirring. After the reaction completion,
the reaction solution was poured into a 25 mL beaker, and 10 mL of
methanol was added for extraction. After extraction, the sulfur content
was measured with a Coulomb instrument WK-2D.

In kinetic experiments,
the reaction activation energy was calculated by measuring the change
in the DBT concentration at different temperatures using the Arrhenius
equation.

The activity evaluation index of the catalyst is represented
by
the removal of the sulfide in the model oil. The method for calculating
the sulphide conversion is as follows 4  C0 refers to the
sulfur concentration initially in the model oil, and Ct refers to the value measured by the
Coulomb instrument WK-2D analyzer after the model oil is subjected
to the catalytic oxidation reaction.
