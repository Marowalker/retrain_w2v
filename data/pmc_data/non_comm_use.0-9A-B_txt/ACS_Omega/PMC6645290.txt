We present a new surface structure-dependent
cold cathode material
capable of sustaining high electron emission current suitable for
next-generation low turn-on field-emission devices. The low turn-on
electric field for electron emission in the cathode materials is critical,
which facilitates the low-power room-temperature operation, a key
factor required by the industrial sector. We demonstrate the facile
synthesis of polypyrrole (PPy)/tin oxide (SnO2)-based core–shell
hybrid cold cathode materials for large area applications. The technique
used here is based on a simple and economical method of surfactant-mediated
polymerization. The coupled investigation of X-ray diffraction along
with electron microscopy reveals the formation of rutile phase SnO2 nanoparticles of size ∼15 nm. These SnO2 nanoparticles act as nucleation sites for the growth of PPy nanofibers,
resulting in encapsulated SnO2 nanoparticles in the PPy
amorphous matrix. The coupling of spherical-shaped core–shell
structures of PPy/SnO2 resulted into the particle train-like
nanostructured form of the hybrid material. These core–shell
structures formed the local p–n junction between the n-type
SnO2 (core) and p-type PPy (shell). The long chains of
these p–n junctions in nanofibers result in the modification
of the electronic band structure of PPy, leading to a reduction in
the work function of the electrons. The significant surface structural
modification in PPy/SnO2 causes a prominent reduction in
the turn-on electric field for electron emission in PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite (∼1.5 V/μm) as compared to the pure PPy
(∼3.3 V/μm) without significant loss in current density
(∼1 mA/cm2). The mechanism of improved field-emission
behavior and advantages of using such hybrid nanomaterials as compared
to other composite nanomaterials have also been discussed in detail.

1 Introduction
In the recent times, we
have witnessed a colossal interest in the
research and development activity aimed at realization of the cold
cathode emitters. The widely used traditional thermionic cathode emitters
operate at very high temperature, leading to the high power consumption.
To counter this problem, it would be desirable to develop the cathode
emitter operating at room temperature. The cold cathode emitters found
potential applications in microwave electronics, vacuum microelectronic
devices, power switches, cathode ray tubes for bright lights, flat-panel
displays, advanced high-resolution electron microscopy, and so forth.1−7 The field-emission process is governed by a quantum tunneling through
the cathode surface under the influence of applied electric field.
It is well-established that the field-emission characteristics strongly
depend on the surface geometry (i.e., the aspect ratio and the surface
structure or the apex size and shape) and the spatial distribution
of the emitters (i.e., alignment and their density). The nanomaterials
with sharp geometrical features (i.e., grainy or sharp edges) provide
high local field, resulting in better field emission and are considered
as ideal candidates for such applications.8−12 Furthermore, one-dimensional structures are considered
to be the perfect configurations for cathode emitters attributed to
their concomitant properties such as improved aspect ratios, low work
functions, linearity to the charge transportation leading to high
conductivities, and high mechanical stabilities.13−17 As field-emission characteristics depend strongly
on the surface structure, a variety of organic or inorganic materials
in different structural forms are extensively investigated at nanoscale,
including single/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),8 silicon nanowires,9 GaS nanohorns,10 CdS nanowires11 and multipods,12 TiO2 nanotip array,13 ZnS nanobelts,14 graphene sheets (GS),15 ZnO nanowires,16 nanonails,17 nanopencils,17 diamond
films,18 and ultrananocrystalline diamond
(UNCD) decorated silicon nanowires19 for
the advanced electron field emitters. These nanostructure forms have
exhibited an excellent field-emission current density; however, most
of these materials have limitations like high turn-on field because
of their large electrical band gap, high self-degradation rate like
in CNTs via oxidation, and so forth which limits their practical applicability
for field-emission devices.20 To sort out
these problems, it would be desirable to develop new materials or
new nanostructural forms of the already existing materials for cathode
emitters.

Another accentuate trend is the use of intrinsic conjugated
polymers
for different electronic applications such as solar cells,14 batteries,21 supercapacitors,22 light-emitting diodes,23 light-dependent resistors,24 electromagnetic
interference shield,25 and gas sensors26 because of an easy and economical capability
of tuning their morphologies. Polypyrrole (PPy) is one such extensively
investigated conjugated polymer with great diversities of surface
structures for a wide range of surface-oriented applications.24,27 However, the field-emission properties of these polymers, particularly
PPy, are not much explored and have only few reports on pure or hybrid
structures of PPy and thus still have lots of potential for the advanced
electron emission.27−29 The emission current density from any cathode surface
can be determined by three rate-limiting processes described as follows:
(i) availability of high concentration of free electrons in the emitting
materials or injection of electrons from another source into the emitting
material, which may be a back electrode or a substrate such as silicon
or any dopant material in the interior of emitter, and the mechanism
is the so-called injection-controlled emission process, (ii) transport
of free electrons to the emitting surface of the emitter that primarily
depends on the conductive islands (such as sp2-hybridized
grains/clusters in carbon allotropes) or doping states, and the process
is known to transport controlled electron emission, and (iii) final
emission of electrons through the cathode–vacuum interface,
which is defined as the front surface-controlled emission process
and is strongly dependent on the surface structure of the emitters,
which determines the probability of electron tunneling across the
emitter–vacuum interface.30 Thus,
according to Fowler–Nordheim (F–N) hypothesis, the surface
structure (i.e., field-enhancement factor) and work function of the
cathode emitters are the key parameters for electron-field emitters.
However, the work function is an intrinsic characteristic of the given
materials under study and may be invariable. On the other hand, the
field-enhancement factor is defined as the ratio of the local field
to the applied field and is dependent on the surface structure. The
field-enhancement factor can be altered by varying parameters such
as aspect ratio and tip diameter10 and
synthesizing nanocomposites based on low work function materials such
as SnO2 (4.3 eV).10,31 Pure SnO2-based nanomaterials are well-known for cathode materials, but the
relatively high turn-on field and low current density limited their
practical applicability for device fabrications. However, the hybrid
nanostructural forms of SnO2 with an intrinsically conducting
polymer (PPy) having an sp2-hybridized carbon structure
could be a good alternative comprising the properties of both types
of organic and inorganic nanomaterials. This combination can behave
like a core–shell structure where SnO2 nanocrystalline
acts as a core, placed at the interior of the structure while PPy
acts as a shell structure, wrapped over the SnO2 nanoparticles.
Thus, SnO2 may play the role of an electron source to inject
the electrons into the PPy matrix while the PPy layer acts as a cathode
surface for the tunneling of electrons to the vacuum. In the present
study, we have prepared one-dimensional nanofibers of PPy and its
nanocomposite (PPy/SnO2) with hexagonal SnO2 nanoparticles. The prepared samples are analyzed for the structural,
morphology conformations and tested for the electron field emission
under the simplified F–N model.

2 Experimental
Details
2.1 Synthesis of SnO2 Nanoparticles
Hexagonal-shaped SnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized
by a simple hydrothermal process. In this process, the salt solution
of SnCl4·5H2O (50 mM) was prepared in 100
mL of methanol and refluxed at 150 °C for 2 h. The solution was
continuously stirred and refluxed to avoid the loss of the solvent.
It was followed by the addition of 30 mM olay amine as a capping agent
and 1 M NH3 to increase the pH of the solution. A separately
prepared solution of 50 mM KOH was added to it dropwise, and the reaction
was further carried out at the same temperature for 2 h. After that,
the solution was allowed to cool down naturally to room temperature,
and SnO2 nanoparticles were collected by the filtration.
The collected nanoparticles were then washed with a copious amount
of water and dried at 80 °C. The synthesized SnO2 nanoparticles
were further annealed at 300 °C for the removal of traces of
the solvent and to improve the crystallinity of the nanoparticles.

The following is the reaction mechanism of the synthesis of the
SnO2 nanoparticles 1   2   3  

2.2 Synthesis of PPy/SnO2 Nanoribbons
PPy/SnO2 nanoribbons were prepared by the surfactant-assisted
chemical oxidation method. For the synthesis of PPy/SnO2 nanoribbons, 15 mM solution of the cationic surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide, CTAB) was prepared in double-distilled water containing 1
M HCl. The above-prepared SnO2 nanoparticles (5 wt %) were
mixed with the surfactant solution under a constant magnetic stirring
for 45 min to ensure the homogeneous mixing of SnO2 nanoparticles.
After 45 min, the oxidant [ammonium persulfate (APS)] solution was
added dropwise to the reaction mixture and stirred. The white precipitates
of (CTA)2S2O8 crystals were observed,
which is an indication of the formation of self-assembly of the surfactant
with the oxidizing agent. The self-assemblies of surfactant–oxidant
embedded with SnO2 nanoparticles act as the nucleation
center for the growth of PPy nanoribbons. As soon as the pyrrole monomer
(30 mM) was added to the surfactant solution, the black precipitates
of PPy appeared within 10 s, which indicates the occurrence of polymerization
over the surface of SnO2 nanoparticles. The growth resulted
in core–shell-type structures, where SnO2 nanoparticles
caged in surfactant micelles behaved like the core and PPy behaved
like the shell. The growth of these core–shell structures was
carried out at room temperature for 12 h in an ambient environment
and then finally, the reaction was terminated by pouring a sufficient
amount of methanol. The as-obtained PPy/SnO2 hybrid was
collected by the filtration and washed several times alternatively
with distilled water and methanol and then finally dried at room temperature.
The prepared sample was labeled as PPy/SnO2. A similar
route has also been used for the synthesis of pure PPy nanofibers.

2.3 Sample Characterization
The morphology
of the PPy/SnO2 hybrid nanomaterials was investigated by
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using an LEO 440 electron
microscope, whereas the crystallinity of the SnO2 nanoparticles
was analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM),
using an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN microscope. The structural investigation
of the pure SnO2 nanoparticles and PPy/SnO2 hybrid
nanostructures was done through X-ray diffraction, using a D8 DISCOVER
(ASX-Bruker) instrument and an X-ray diffractometer employing Cu Kα
radiation. The molecular structural transformation of PPy due to the
incorporation of SnO2 nanoparticles in the amorphous polymeric
matrix and the formation of PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite were
further confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
using the PerkinElmer-RX1 spectrum. The field-emission measurements
were carried out in a high vacuum (3 × 10–7 mbar) condition created by a high-efficiency turbo-molecular pump
backed with the rotary pump. The electron emission current was recorded
by a Keithley 2410 source measure unit in the two-electrode geometry
at different applied voltages in a sandwich structure [indium tin
oxide (ITO)/Teflon spacer/sample/silver] as shown in Figure 1. The ITO-coated glass was
used as an anode, whereas a Teflon spacer (150 μm thickness)
was used to produce the vacuum gap between the sample and the anode.
The emission of the electron took place from the sample surface area
of ∼0.0708 cm2 through a hole (dia. 3 mm) in the
Teflon spacer used to produce vacuum gap. To scale up the reproducibility
and stability of the samples, the applied field was cycled 15 times
up to a current density of about 1 mA/cm2. The turn-on
field, which is defined as the applied electric field at the electron
emission current density of ∼1.7 × 10–7 A/cm–2, successively reduced in each cycle. Such
successive reduction in the turn-on field with each cycle of the applied
field is generally referred to the conditioning and very often for
the cathode materials, used for the cleaning of the emitter surface.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Surface
Morphological Investigations
Figure 2a shows the
TEM image of hexagonal-shaped SnO2 nanoparticles having
a particle size of ∼15 nm. The nanoparticles are highly crystalline,
as exhibited by the clear lattice planes (inset of Figure 2a). The selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern of SnO2 nanoparticles consists
of several well-defined rings (inset Figure 2a), which confirms the crystalline nature
of the nanoparticles. The lattice planes with an interplaner spacing
of ∼3.5 Å corresponding to the (110) plane show the rutile
phase of SnO2 nanoparticles. Figure 2b shows the SEM image of PPy nanoclips with
a diameter of about 72 nm and a length of about 2–3 μm. Figure 2c shows the SEM image
of the PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite consisting of long chains
of core–shell structures in the form of particles’ nanotrain-like
features. A single core–shell structure has a diameter of about
∼150 nm; however, the diameter of the prepared nanostructures
is slightly higher because of the side-by-side overlapping of core–shell
structures. However, the presence of the granule structure with fine
pores between side layers may provide a larger surface area for improved
field-emission characteristics. The length of these particle trains
is very large (5–6 μm) as compared to the pure PPy nanoclips,
which is further increased because of the knot-like heads. This is
because particle-like core–shell nanostructures are formed
because of the wrapping of PPy chains (p-type) over the SnO2 (n-type) nanoparticles. Thus, these elongated nanostructures with
increased length are presumed to be the long chains of a large number
of p–n junctions formed between the p-type PPy and n-type SnO2. The presence of these nodule-like structures and the improved
length significantly increase the electron-emitting surface area and
surface roughness, that is, electron-emitting sites at the surface,
which are backed with an electron source and SnO2 (i.e.,
the oxygen vacancies present in SnO2 nanoparticles) and
may be responsible for good field emission.

image with crystalline planes and the SAED pattern), SEM micrographs
of (b) pure PPy, (c) PPy/SnO2, and (d) mechanism of the
formation of PPy/SnO2 particles’ train-like structures.

The growth mechanism of core–shell
structures (p–n
junctions) in the surfactant-mediated approach used for the synthesis
of PPy/SnO2 hybrid nanostructures can be understood as
follows (Figure 2d).
CTAB is a cationic surfactant, whose molecule has a hydrophilic head
and hydrophobic tail; thus, in the aqueous solution at the lower concentration,
these molecules form a monolayer at the water/air interface, pointing
the tails in the air. On increasing the concentration, the agglomeration
of surfactant molecules starts in the bulk of the solution and takes
the spherical shape throughout the solution as soon as the critical
micelle concentration (0.89 mM for CTAB33) is reached. With the addition of SnO2 nanoparticles,
they are trapped inside the cages of micelles and on the addition
of APS solution, the self-assembling of surfactant micelles takes
place in the form of a (CTA)2S2O8 crystal into fibular shapes embedded with SnO2 nanoparticles.
While the polymerization proceeds, these crystals are wrapped by uniform
layers of PPy chains, resulting in the train-like nanostructural features.
The synthesis of pure PPy was also done by the same method, following
the similar mechanism of nanofiber formation without SnO2 doping.

3.2 Structural and Chemical Bonding Analysis
Figure 3a illustrates
the XRD patterns of SnO2 nanoparticles and the PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite. It is observed that the XRD pattern of SnO2 nanoparticles comprises four broad peaks located at ∼26,
31, 39, and 51° corresponding to (hkl) planes
(110), (101), (200), and (211), respectively, and well-matched with
the rutile phase of SnO2 (JCPDS 41-1145).32,34,35 The observed peaks of SnO2 are used to evaluate the crystallite size by the standard
Scherrer’s formula and are found to be ∼10–12
nm. The average crystallite size observed by XRD study is very close
to the average particle size evaluated through the HRTEM study. The
XRD pattern of the PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite also contains
peaks similar to those observed in pure SnO2 nanoparticles,
indicating the formation of the PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite.

Figure 3 (a) XRD
patterns of PPy and PPy/SnO2 nanocomposites
and (b) FTIR spectra of SnO2 nanoparticles, pure PPy, and
PPy/SnO2 nanocomposites.

The chemical structure of pure PPy, SnO2 nanoparticles,
and their nanocomposites (PPy/SnO2) has been analyzed through
the FTIR spectroscopic studies (Figure 3b). The FTIR spectrum of SnO2 consists of
an intense broad band located at ∼566 cm–1 with a satellite band observed around 648 cm–1, which are ascribed to Sn–O–Sn stretching vibration
and O–Sn–O bending vibrations in SnO2, respectively.
Apart from these fundamental bands of SnO2, some more bands
are also observed at ∼1678, 3054, and 3476 cm–1 because of the O–H group owing to the precursor materials
and environmental exposure.35 While the
FTIR spectrum of pure PPy consisting of an intense broad band at ∼3422
cm–1 associated with the N–H stretching vibration
of PPy, related with the bonding state of heteroatom (−N−)
present in the pyrrole monomer, with hydrogen. The position and the
intensity of this band are very crucial because a decrease in the
intensity of this band is directly related with the deficiency of
the hydrogen atom at the heteroatom and hence the change in the conducting
state of PPy. The doublet present at ∼2854 and 2922 cm–1 can be attributed to the C–H stretching vibration
of methyl and methylene and generally arises because of the trace
of organic precursor materials in the form of traces of surfactant
molecules and so forth. In the mid-frequency region of the spectrum,
two fundamental bands of PPy are present at ∼1558 and 1456
cm–1, which are attributed to the asymmetric (C=C)
and symmetric (C=N) ring stretching vibrations, respectively.
These bands are very crucial in understanding the conducting state
of PPy and the order of conjugation (i.e., conjugation length). The
intensity ratio of the symmetric (1456 cm–1) to
asymmetric (1558 cm–1) bands is associated with
the conjugation length, that is, the higher intensity ratio (I1456/I1558) means
the higher conjugation and the high conducting state of PPy. Besides
the fundamental bands of PPy, these bands arise because of the doping
states of PPy are also present in both the PPy and PPy/SnO2 samples at ∼1314, 1188, 1050, 924, and 796 cm–1 and can be attributed to the C–N stretching vibration, N–H
in-plane deformation, C–H out-of-plane deformation, C–H
in-plane deformation, and C–H out-of-plane bending vibrations,
respectively.36−40

All these bands of pure PPy are also present in the PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite sample. However, the major difference in the
FTIR spectrum of the PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite is that the
intensity of the N–H stretching vibration band (∼3432
cm–1) decreases significantly along with the presence
of the band associated with the O–H group at ∼3120 cm–1 and arises because of the doping of SnO2. The decrease in the intensity of the N–H stretching vibration
band can be attributed to the deficiency of the hydrogen atom at the
heteroatom (−N−)36 in the
presence of surface (on SnO2 surface)-adsorbed oxygen ions
(O2– or O–).24 The deficiency of the hydrogen atom at the heteroatom can
be ascribed to the transfer of one proton (H+ ion) to the
oxygen ion to form O–H, and a charge compensation process takes
place. Such a charge compensation process can be understood via the
chemical reactions as follows 4   5   6  or 7  

Apart from this, a doublet was observed at ∼622 and
682
cm–1 in the PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite (encircled
with dots), which can be attributed to the p–n junction bands
obtained by the overlapping of n-type SnO2 nanoparticles
by p-type PPy layers.

3.3 Field-Emission Properties
of PPy and PPy/SnO2 Hybrid Cathodes
The electron
field-emission behavior
of the pure PPy and PPy/SnO2 hybrid samples is analyzed
in terms of the simplified F–N relation of emission current
density, and the applied electric field is given by8−19,41 8  where J is the emission
current
density, Φ is the work function of the emitter material which
is ∼5.1 eV for PPy42 and ∼4.3
eV for SnO2 nanoparticles,31E is the strength of the electric applied field,
and β is the field-enhancement factor which generally depends
upon the geometry of the emitter, crystal structure, vacuum gaps,
and spatial distribution of electron-emitting centers.43A and B are
the F–N constants given by  and  6.83 × 109 eV−3/2 V m−1, where e, h, and me are the elementary
positive charge, Planck constant, and the electron mass, respectively.
The field-emission current density (J) as a function
of the applied electric field (E) is measured repeatedly
(about 15 runs) on both the PPy and PPy/SnO2 samples (Figure 4a,b), and it is observed
that in the successive run, the turn-on field decreases from 4.1 to
3.3 V/μm in PPy nanofibers and from 2.0 to 1.5 V/μm in
PPy/SnO2 p–n junctions. This type of electronic
roughing or preconditioning is an important step for the field emitter
to neutralize the defective site and clean the cathode surface. Such
electronic conditioning made the emitter surface clean which leads
to the stable high emission current at low field. However, it is an
interestingly striking feature of the prepared PPy nanofibers and
the PPy/SnO2 hybrid sample that the emission current density
remains almost constant during all cycles. Moreover, such electronic
conditioning of the samples determines the reusability of the sample
for the same applied electric field. It has been observed that beyond
the 10th run, the field-emission current and turn-on fields are not
changed significantly, which indicates that the sample becomes stable
against the electronic roughing/conditioning and suggests the potential
applicability for practical purposes. Moreover, it is observed that
the decrease in the turn-on field is very small for the PPy/SnO2 hybrid sample (∼0.4 V/μm) as compared to the
pure PPy (∼0.8 V/μm), indicating the high stability of
the PPy/SnO2 sample in terms of both the turn-on field
and the emission current. However, both samples are stable electron
emitters for cold cathode devices.

Figure 4 Field-emission J–E characteristics
of (a) pure PPy (PPy), (b) PPy with 5 wt % incorporation of SnO2 NPs (PPy/SnO2) for a different run up to 15 runs,
(c) pure PPy and PPy/SnO2 taken after electronic conditioning,
and (d) variation of ln(J/E2) vs 1/E characteristics of the samples PPy
and PPy/SnO2 in the usual F–N representation. The
straight lines indicate that the emission from these materials follows
the F–N emission mechanism.

After ensuring the stability of the samples, J–E characteristics of both samples have been
recorded and plotted in Figure 4c as the comparative curves. It is revealed from Figure 4c that the turn-on
field decreased from ∼3.3 V/μm in the PPy nanofibers
to 1.5 V/μm in the PPy/SnO2 hybrid at the same current
density, which indicates that the p–n junctions of PPy/SnO2 exhibit the same current density at a very low (at about
one third) applied electric field. The turn-on field is defined as
the electric field required for drawing the current from the cathode
surface and observed that the turn-on field for both the PPy nanofibers
and PPy/SnO2 samples is comparable or less than the nanostructures
of different materials used for field emission. For example, the turn-on
field for the GaS nanohorns is 4.2 V/μm,10 for the aligned CdS nanowires, it is ∼7.8 V/μm,11 for the multipods, it is ∼7.2 V/μm,12 for the TiO2 nanotip array, it is
∼9.4 V/μm,13 for the nanotube,
it is ∼34 V/μm,44 for the
ZnS nanobelts, it is ∼3.8 V/μm,14 for the ZnO nanowires, it is∼5 V/μm,16 for the nanonails, it is ∼7.9 V/μm,17 and for the nanopencils, it is 7.2 V/μm.17 The turn-on field ∼1.3 V/μm for
the PPy/SnO2 p–n junctions is also less than the
electric field observed in different carbon nanostructures such as
UNCD (5.6 V/μm),45 CNTs [(2.3 V/μm),46 (1.55 V/μm)47], UNCD/CNTs (4.9 V/μm),48 CNT/ZnO
films (1.3 and 2.5 V/μm),49 UNCD-decorated
silicon nanowires (3.7 V/μm),19 GS
(4.4 V/μm), GS/CsI (2.5 V/μm), MWCNTs/CsI (3.2 V/m),15 and various other nanostructures of carbon.50−53 The turn-on field of the prepared p–n junction in PPy is
also less than or equal to the MWCNT/PPy nanocomposite (1.4 V/μm)28 and PPy/tetrabutylammonium-hexafluorophosphate
(PPy/TBAPF6) nanowires (3.5 V/μm).29 The electron density is strongly dependent upon the work
function (Φ) and the field-enhancement factor (β), and
the value of β can be obtained from the F–N plots of
ln(J/E2) versus 1/E as shown in Figure 4d by considering that Φ is known. The straight lines
between the ln(J/E2)
and 1/E curves suggest that the electrons are emitted
via the cold cathode emission process determined by the barrier tunneling
and quantum mechanical processes.8−18,44−53 The field-enhancement factors (β) have been evaluated for
both samples from the slopes of F–N plots by using the relation15,42 9  where d is the thickness
of spacer. The value of the field-enhancement factor has been calculated
from the slope of F–N plots for both the pure and doped PPy
samples and are found to be 2142.24 and 5665.45, respectively, which
indicates that the PPy/SnO2 p–n junctions have the
higher field-enhancement factor as compared to the PPy and can be
attributed to the emission of electrons from the sp2-hybridized
conjugated structure of PPy assisted with SnO2 doping and
the emission directly from PPy via the higher local electric field.
The value of β for PPy/SnO2 p–n junctions
is found to be greater than the reported values for MWCNT/PPy (5480),28 PPy/TBAPF6 nanowires (∼700),29 and MWCNTs (1980).54 The field emission is strongly determined by the geometric shape
of the emitters because the geometric field-enhancement factor gives
the major contribution in the total field-enhanced factor. In the
case of the PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite, the field-enhancement
factor can be given by the product of three components of the field-enhancement
factor such as the geometric factor (βg), that is,
the granule structures distributed throughout the one-dimensional
feature of nanofibers responsible for the enhanced surface area and
surface roughness, the sp2-hybridized conjugated carbon
structure/clusters (βsp2), and the doping
of n-type SnO2 nanoparticles (βS) in the
p-type polymer matrix responsible for the distribution of a large
number of p–n junctions throughout the sample and expressed
as 10  

This is
because the parameter β is related with the local
induced field and generally expressed in terms of the ratio of local
(Elocal) to applied (Eapplied) electric field.55 Thus,
the higher value of β of PPy/SnO2 via the above-discussed
mechanism suggests the generation of the high local field (Elocal = βEapplied) at the lower applied electric field that is required for good field-emission
property of the material and also confirms the lower value of the
turn-on field for the PPy/SnO2 sample.

3.4 Mechanism of Electron Emission in PPy/SnO2 p–n
Junctions
The observation of electron
emission in these organic materials at the low turn-on field can be
understood via the three types of mechanisms. First, the higher value
of emission current at the low turn-on field in PPy/SnO2 over the pure PPy may be due to the injection of electrons from
SnO2 crystals to PPy layer due to the band bending at the
PPy/SnO2 interfaces. To explore the mechanism of the flow
of electrons across the PPy/SnO2 p–n junctions,
the energy-level diagram of PPy/SnO2 has been shown in Figure 5a,b. Figure 5a represents the energy-level
diagrams of p-type and n-type materials that represent the location
of Fermi and vacuum levels. The formation of p–n junctions
between the PPy and SnO2 modifies the band gap of PPy and
reduces the work function of the electron that can be defined as the
difference between the Fermi level (EF) and the vacuum energy level (Evac)
and having values 5.1 and 4.3 eV for PPy and SnO2, respectively.
In the equilibrium condition of the PPy/SnO2 p–n
junction, the Fermi levels of both the organic and inorganic materials
are aligned (Figure 5b). This interfacial interaction between PPy and SnO2 promotes
the tunneling of electrons across the PPy/SnO2 interface
and emission through the PPy layers. The modification in the electronic
structure of PPy causes a synergistic effect in the field emission.
The mechanism of band bending in different interfaces such as CNT–dielectric
material interface, CNT–diamond interface, CNT–aC interface,
and other materials is available in the literature.42,57,58

and n-type materials,
(b) energy-level diagram for the p–n junction between p-type
and n-type materials, (c) schematic representation for band bending
under the influence of the applied field and tunneling of electron,
and (d) demonstration of the SnO2 nanocrystals in the PPy
matrix resulting in core–shell structures, responsible for
improved field-emission characteristics.

The second mechanism that may strongly contribute in the
electron
emission is the change in the work function and the potential barrier
height due to the change in geometrical structure factors. The electron
affinity (χ) and the work function (Φ) are also strongly
dependent on the geometrical structure of the surface and can vary
with the spatial distance on the surface. In the case of granular
surfaces with patches as in the present case of PPy/SnO2, the values of these parameters change with the location on the
surface because in the equilibrium, the Fermi level remains constant
throughout the material, but the vacuum level can change with the
location. On the other hand, for the smoother surface as in the case
of pure PPy nanofibers, we can ignore the effect of the surface structure
and image forces on the work function, but the work function depends
on the position of the Fermi level with respect to the conduction
band edge that can be affected by the doping. Moreover, in the case
of smoother surfaces, the band bending takes place under the influence
of the applied field for which the electron affinity may remain constant,
but the work function may change because of the downward band bending
in the case of the strong field and referred to as the operative work
function. On the other hand, for the rough (granule) surfaces with
surface states, the upward bending will take place and cause the change
in the work function. Thus, the extent of bending and sign depends
on the strength of the field and the presence of surface states which
determines the value of the work function. Moreover, when the image
forces are taken into consideration and the external
field is present, because of the Schottky lowering or other related
effects, the barrier height due to the electron at the Fermi level
is less than the work function and defined as the apparent work function
or reduced barrier height,58 and thus the
electron emission takes place at the lower applied field.

Apart
from the contribution of local p–n junctions in the
band bending and surface structures on work function and barrier height
for electron emission, field-emission characteristics of the present
samples strongly depend on the surface morphology-arbitrated geometrical
structure factor. The incorporation of hexagonal-shaped SnO2 nanoparticles with the six sharp edges results in the granule-like
surface morphology of the prepared hybrid sample, where these granules
act as an individual electron emitter. The sharp edges of SnO2 nanoparticles act as an electron source because of the high
oxygen vacancies in SnO2, whereas the PPy layer over these
crystals acts as a tunneling layer for electron transport. The electron
emission in PPy/SnO2 may be caused by the decrease in the
work function of PPy nanofibers as discussed previously because of
the incorporation of SnO2 nanoparticles and the change
in the surface structure of the sample. It is believed here that the
surface morphology of the emitter made profound impact on the reduction
of the turn-on fields as compared to the work function due to the
major contribution of geometrical field-enhancement factor in the
induced field. It is well-reported in the literature that the whisker-like
tips emit at significant lower field as compared to the planar morphology
of the same material.56,59 Moreover, materials with the
high surface-to-volume ratios and/or the geometrical/morphological
disorderness (rough surfaces) will experience high local electric
field because such surfaces have high field-enhancement factor β,
which determines the strength of emission current occurring from electron
tunneling through the emitter–vacuum potential barrier. The
relatively high value of β parameter in the present case is
responsible for significant electron emission current at the low turn-on
field in these samples. The development of the high local field at
the interface of dielectric/semiconducting (SnO2) and highly
conducting sp2-hybridized PPy can be understood via the
mechanism demonstrated in Figure 5d because SnO2 crystals are thoroughly distributed
into the sp2-hybridized polymer matrix, that is, the conducting
sp2-bonded grain boundaries surround the dielectric crystalline
grains and under the action of external applied field, a strong local
field will develop around the SnO2 crystal at the PPy/SnO2 interface. This results in the high value of the field-enhancement
factor (β) and hence in the low-threshold field-emission behavior
of the PPy/SnO2 p–n junctions. It is reported in
the literature that the presence of sp2 clusters (size
as well as the density) may play an important role in determining
the field-emission properties of the carbon films. It is believed
that the rapid hopping or exchange of electrons between the sp2-hybridized clusters results in improved field emission. The
high sp2 content results in the overlapping of the clusters,
which plausibly improves the effective connectivity between the clusters
and hence enhanced electron delocalization or hopping between the
clusters.55,60 Thus, the conjugated structure of PPy may
be one of the reasons for high emission current at low field in these
samples. Under the influence of the external field, the electrons
are extracted from the surface of the sample, and replenishment of
the emitted electron of the surface layer is fulfilled because of
the good conductivity between the clusters. The electron emission
in such sp2-hybridized samples can be expressed as a “front
face”-type emission, which exhibit a lower threshold field.55,60,61 The size of the cluster can be
a crucial parameter for field emission; the pure PPy sample may have
small-sized clusters separated by a larger gap, whereas SnO2 doping may act as a catalyst which results in the clustering of
the sp2-hybridized carbon and hence lower turn-on and threshold
voltage in the PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite. The schematic representation
of the field-emission model for such materials is depicted in Figure 5d, in which dielectric
regions (SnO2) or crystals are surrounded by sp2-hybridized conducting (PPy) grain boundaries. These conducting grain
boundaries provided the easy pathway for the transport of electrons
and hence the improved field-emission properties. Thus, the field
emission of these samples can be explained in terms of size and number
of the sp2 clusters lying at or near the Fermi level, and
the size of clusters must be large enough for the effective connectivity
between them. Ilie et al.61 demonstrated
the effect of clusters’ size on the field threshold of different
amorphous carbon films and suggested that the optimal size of the
clusters is found to be 1.5 to 2 nm for emission depending upon the
type of the film. In summary, the enhanced field emission in these
samples can be governed by the band-bending process under the influence
of surface geometrical structures and applied field, change in the
work function of the material due to the surface states, and the improved
field-enhancement factor via the change in the surface morphology
due to the incorporation of SnO2 crystals. A continuous
supply of electrons from the SnO2 to the sp2-hybridized conjugated structure of PPy provides an easy pathway
for the tunneling of electron and hence electron emission through
the vacuum gap.

4 Conclusions
Hexagonal-shaped
SnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized
by the surfactant-directed hydrothermal process, whereas the pure
PPy and PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite have been prepared by the
surfactant-assisted chemical oxidation polymerization method. The
SEM studies reveal that pure PPy has nanoclip-like nanofibers with
a diameter of about 72 nm that changes into a nanoribbon-like morphology
of PPy nanoparticles in the SnO2-doped PPy (PPy/SnO2) sample. The change in surface morphology in the PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite may be due to the wrapping of PPy chains over
the SnO2 crystals. The presence of SnO2 nanoparticles
may play an important role in the nucleation of the PPy, resulting
in the formation of particle train-like nanostructured form of the
hybrid material, encapsulated with SnO2 nanoparticles in
the PPy amorphous matrix. The coupling of spherical-shaped core–shell
structures of PPy/SnO2 resulted in the localized p–n
junctions between the n-type SnO2 (cores) and p-type PPy
(shells). The presence of chains of these p–n junctions in
nanofibers causes a reduction in the work function for electrons via
the modification of the electronic band structure of PPy. The significant
surface structural modification in PPy/SnO2 leads to a
prominent reduction in the turn-on electric field for electron emission
in the PPy/SnO2 nanocomposite (∼1.5 V/μm)
as compared to the pure PPy (∼3.3 V/μm) without a significant
loss in current density (∼1 mA/cm2).
