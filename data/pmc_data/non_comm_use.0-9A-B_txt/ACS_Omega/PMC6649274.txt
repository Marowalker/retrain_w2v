Lead-free organic–inorganic
halide perovskites have gained
much attention as nontoxic alternatives to CH3NH3PbI3 in next-generation solar cells. In this study, we
have examined the geometric and electronic properties of methylammonium
germanium iodide CH3NH3GeI3 using
density functional theory. Identifying a suitable functional to accurately
model the germanium halide perovskites is crucial to allow the theoretical
investigation for tuning the optoelectronic properties. The performance
of various functionals (PBE, PBE+D3, PBEsol, PBEsol+D3, HSE06, and
HSE06+D3) has been evaluated for modelling the structure and properties.
The calculation of electronic properties was further refined by using
the quasiparticle GW method on the optimized geometries,
and that has an excellent agreement with the experiment. We report
from our GW calculations that the characteristic
of the density of states for CH3NH3GeI3 resembles the density of states for CH3NH3PbI3 and the effective masses of the charge carriers of
CH3NH3GeI3 are comparable to the
effective masses of CH3NH3PbI3 as
well as silicon used in commercially available solar cells.

Introduction
Efficient and cost-effective
harvesting of solar energy is a major
challenge in photovoltaics, which can meet the demands in future energy
challenges.1 Though crystalline silicon
photovoltaics dominate the solar-cell market presently, there are
still a lot of issues related to high manufacturing cost and recombinational,
reflection, and absorption losses along with efficiency issues.2,3 Lead-based hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) represents a major breakthrough
in the field of low-cost photovoltaic materials.4,5 Kojima
et al. explored CH3NH3PbI3 as a light
harvester in liquid-based dye-sensitized solar cells for the first
time in 2009.6 Since then, the power conversion
efficiencies of lead hybrid perovskites have increased from 3.8 to
over 23.7% within a decade.6−8 The significant performance of
the hybrid perovskites can be attributed to their appropriate band
gaps, large carrier lifetimes, and long carrier diffusion lengths.9,10 Solar cells based on hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 have therefore become a prospective alternative to
conventional photovoltaics owing to their efficiency, low cost and
simple processing.11 Theoretical studies
have been key to understanding the properties that encompass the structure,
stability, bandgaps, band alignments, and dielectric properties of
hybrid perovskites.12−18 Walsh and co-workers have made significant contributions in understanding
the photovoltaic performance of hybrid perovskites through their theoretical
studies that includes the effects of ferroelectric tendencies,19−22 cation dynamics,23 polyanion substitution,24 halogen replacement,25 defects,26,27 band gap engineering,28 phonon anharmonicity,29 and other physical properties.30 De Angelis
and co-workers have brought added insights into the structure, properties,
and factors that influence the exciton binding energy through their
theoretical studies.31−36 Motta et al. studied the role of organic cations in CH3NH3PbI3 and revealed that molecular rotations
of the organic cation with the resulting dynamical change in the band
structure might be the origin of the slow carrier recombination and
the greater conversion efficiency of CH3NH3PbI3.37

Despite the huge potential
of the hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, there are two main drawbacks: the
instability of the materials, which decompose in the presence of humid
air,38 and the toxicity of lead. Modifications
in the organic structures such as long alkyl chains and layered structures
have been suggested as mechanisms to increase the stability of lead
halide perovskites.39,40 To improve the stability without
affecting the performance, methylammonium has been partially replaced
by cesium in lead halide solar cell devices.41,42 Scanlon and co-workers explored the efficacy of various solar absorbers
beyond CH3NH3PbI3,43−46 cation replacement structures47,48 and anion replacement structures,49,50 to obtain
stable and efficient photovoltaic materials. However, it has become
increasingly important to replace lead to develop nontoxic and eco-friendly
alternative light-harvesting hybrid materials. The Sn-based perovskite
CH3NH3SnI3 has been shown to have
a similar structure to CH3NH3PbI3, but studies show that it suffers from low efficiency.51−54 Moving from perovskite to double perovskite such as Cs2AgBiBr6 is considered as an approach where lead can be
replaced by nontoxic cations.44,55,56 Zhao et al. employed a cation-transmutation method to design lead-free
inorganic halide perovskites such as Cs2InSbCl6 and Cs2InBiCl6, although In is already overused
in transparent conducting oxides (TCOs).57

Germanium-based materials have recently received attention
as potential
candidates for nontoxic photovoltaics as germanium belongs to the
same group as lead and tin.58−60 Kanatzidis and co-workers synthesized
a broad and structurally diverse family of polar hybrid perovskites
based on the trigonal pyramidal [GeI3]− building block.61 Krishnamoorthy et al.
synthesized germanium-based hybrid perovskite materials and reported
the power conversion efficiency of CsGeI3 to be 0.11% and
CH3NH3GeI3 to be 0.20%.62 Germanium-based hybrid perovskites are also
expected to have drawbacks such as instability due to oxidation from
(II) to (IV) as also observed in the case of tin(II)-based perovskites.
In general, the relative stability of the 2+ oxidation state increases
from carbon to lead ( Ge2+ < Sn2+ < Pb2+). Nevertheless, their stability in a confined environment
may depend on various factors such as the size of the cations. Sun
et al. compared the stability of Pb-, Sn-, and Ge- based hybrid perovskites
using density functional theory and found that the order of stability
is CH3NH3PbI3 > CH3NH3GeI3 > CH3NH3SnI3.63 However, so far, to the best
of our
knowledge, there is no experimental evidence to compare the stability
of CH3NH3GeI3 and CH3NH3SnI3. Zhao et al. reported that applying compressive
strain on CH3NH3GeI3 enables it to
achieve superior optical absorption and transport properties.64 The reported theoretical band gaps for CH3NH3GeI3 exhibit significant discrepancies:
the band gaps obtained using the PBE method ranges from 1.17 to 1.61
eV58,59,63 and those
of the hybrid functional range from 1.70 to 2.04 eV.58,63 Hence, it is vital to identify an accurate computational method
for further investigation on tuning the structure and properties of
CH3NH3GeI3.

In this article,
a systematic structural evaluation of CH3NH3GeI3 has been performed employing different
DFT and hybrid DFT methods to analyze the accuracy of each method
to reproduce the experimental structure and electronic structure.
The band structure, band gap, optical absorption, and effective masses of
CH3NH3GeI3 have been investigated
in detail. Total and partial electronic density-of-states analyses
of CH3NH3GeI3 are used to understand
the electronic contributions to the band edges. We resolve the ambiguity
of the band gap by performing the first state-of-the-art many-body
perturbation theory calculations in the GW approximation
on CH3NH3GeI3. The electronic properties
of CH3NH3GeI3 obtained from this
study are compared with those of CH3NH3PbI3 from the literature in order to evaluate the ability of CH3NH3GeI3 as a nontoxic replacement.

Results
and Discussion
CH3NH3GeI3 rhombohedral perovskite
unit cells (12 atoms per cell) were optimized starting from the trigonal
structure with the R3m space group
as determined by X-ray diffraction at 293 K.61 The 12-atom unit cell used in this structure may not be able to
capture the possible octahedral tilts and symmetry breaking in the
dynamic structure.65,66 Hybrid perovskite often displays
a dynamic average structure at room temperature, and results from
average structures have been often shown to give good insight into
the electronic properties.60,67 The unit cell consists
of corner-linked distorted octahedra of the I anions, with the Ge
cation at their center and the CH3NH3 cation
between them (Figure 1). There are two types of Ge–I bonds in the GeI6 octahedra in which Ge–I(1) is shorter than Ge–I(2).
The lattice parameters of the optimized structures of CH3NH3GeI3 such as lattice vector (a), angle (α), volume (V), and the bond distances
of Ge–I(1), Ge–I(2), and C–N are given in Table 1. Calculation carried
out using PBEsol displays an underestimation of the lattice vector,
angle, volume, and Ge–I(2) bond distance. It predicts that
the angle and Ge–I(1) bond distance are similar to the experimental
values. PBE overestimates the lattice vectors, volume, and Ge–I(2)
bond length. The angle (0.62% error) and the Ge–I(1) bond distance
(0.25% error) calculated from PBE are in good agreement with the experimental
values. HSE06 overestimates the lattice vector, volume, and Ge–I(2)
bond distance and underestimates the angle and Ge–I(1) bond
distance. The inclusion of dispersion corrections causes a reduction
in the unit cell volume and associated bond lengths. PBEsol+D3 significantly
underestimates all the lattice parameters and bond lengths. The parameters
predicted from PBE+D3 are in good agreement with the experimental
structural parameters of CH3NH3GeI3 with the lattice vector reproduced within 0.94%, angle by 1.30%,
volume by 3.11%, Ge–I(1) by 0.11%, and Ge–I(2) by 1.36%.
HSE06+D3 calculations are in good agreement with the experimental
lattice vector, volume, and Ge–I(2) bond distance. They underestimate
the angle and Ge–I(1) bond distance. Our calculated C–N
bond lengths by all the methods considered are higher than the experimental
value. The difference may be due to the finite temperature measurement
(293 K) of the experiment. Reviewing the literature on C–N
bond lengths in hybrid perovskites shows an interesting variation.
At low temperature, the bond length matches that expected from the
benchmark ammonium ion68 and agrees with
computational work (see Table S1).69−71 The bond length also agrees well with low-temperature (<200 K)
experimental structural data.72−74 At higher temperatures (>290
K), the bond lengths appear to shrink below 1.4 Å, which is more
than likely an artifact of the dynamical motion of the cation.75,76

The band structures calculated along high symmetry
directions in
the Brillouin zone using PBE+D3 are given in Figure 2a. All of the methods used give rise to similar
band structures except with different band gaps (see Supporting Information, Figure S1). CH3NH3GeI3 is characterized by a direct band gap at the Z point of the Brillouin zone for all the methods considered,
indicating possible strong optical absorption. The band gaps (Table 2) for PBEsol (0.89
eV) and PBE (1.39 eV) are greatly underestimated compared to the experimental
value (1.90 eV),61 and the addition of
dispersion correction further reduces these band gaps. These results
are as expected as the GGA method generally underestimates the band
gap of semiconductors. HSE06 predicted a band gap that is closer to
the experimental result; however, the inclusion of dispersion interactions
also decreases the band gap to 1.60 eV. Our calculation reveals that
DFT functionals with the standard proportion of D3 dispersion identified
by Grimme clearly overbind the structure.77

We
evaluated the effective mass (m*) of the charge
carriers at the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band
minimum (CBM) using the parabolic approximation. In general, highly
dispersed bands signify a high degree of charge carrier delocalization,
which results in high mobility and thus high conductivity. The theoretically
calculated effective masses of CH3NH3PbI3 at the PBE+D3 level are mh* = 0.29 and me* = 0.2367 and the reduced mass μ = 0.13 (μ
= me*·mh*/(me* + mh*)), while the experimentally determined
reduced mass of CH3NH3PbI3 is 0.09–0.15m0.78 In Table 2, we have listed our
theoretical effective masses of the holes (mh*) and electrons
(me*) and the reduced mass μ of CH3NH3GeI3 in the Z–Γ direction
for different methods. There is no significant trend observed in the
effective masses obtained from different functionals. The inclusion
of dispersion interaction reduces the effective masses for all the
methods considered. The calculated effective masses of CH3NH3GeI3 obtained at the PBE+D3 are smaller
than those of CH3NH3PbI3 obtained
using the same method67 and indicate excellent
mobility.

We have computed the optical absorption spectrum of
CH3NH3GeI3 within the transversal
approximation
and PAW method.79 The optical band gaps
for all the DFT and hybrid DFT methods considered are identical to
the fundamental band gaps obtained for the respective methods, indicating
strong symmetry-allowed VBM-to-CBM transitions.

Figure 2b shows
the total and partial densities of states of CH3NH3GeI3. The overall shape and characteristics are
found to be similar for all the other methods considered (see Figure S2 of the Supporting Information). The
VBM is mainly composed of the I(p) mixed with a small percentage of
Ge(s), while the CBM is mainly Ge(p) with a small contribution from
I(p). As shown in the inset figure, the organic cation CH3NH3+ has no significant contribution to the
band edges. The band edge characters observed here for CH3NH3GeI3 are consistent with the band edge characters
of CH3NH3PbI3, where the VBM is formed
through Pb(s)/I(p) combination, while the CBM is formed mainly by
Pb(p) orbitals.19

In summary, without
dispersion correction, PBEsol underestimates
the geometry, while PBE and HSE06 overestimate it. PBE+D3 gives rise
to the best prediction of lattice parameters and the geometry. HSE06+D3
predicted the structural parameters in good agreement with the experiment,
while PBEsol+D3 gave a poor reproduction of the observed structure.
Qualitatively, for all the methods considered, the overall shapes
of the electronic structure in terms of both the band structure and
characteristics of the density of states are found to be similar with
the exception of the band gap magnitude. DFT methods largely underestimate
the experimental band gap. Although HSE06 predicted a band gap that
is closer to the experimental result, the addition of dispersion interactions
decreases the band gap, and hence, all methods predict band gaps that
are significantly smaller than the experimental values. The introduction
of dispersion correction decreases the volume of the system for all
functionals (Table 1). This decrease in the volume changes the overlap and thus causes
a widening of the gap between the VBM and CBM. This leads to a small
increase in the band dispersion and hence a decrease in the effective
masses and subsequent narrowing of the band gap (Table 2). To address the electronic
structure, we have performed state-of-the-art many-body perturbation
theory calculations in the GW approximation using
PBE+D3 and HSE06+D3 optimized structures. In modeling lead hybrid
perovskites, it has been found that for a precise description of the
electronic structure, it is required to calculate many-body quasiparticle
energies, for example, in the framework of the GW approximation.80−84

Many-body perturbation theory, which is within the single-shot G0W0, partially self-consistent GW0, and the self-consistent GW have been applied to
our PBE+D3 and HSE06+D3 calculations. The band structure and electronic
density of states of CH3NH3GeI3 obtained
at G0W0 (PBE+D3)
are shown in Figure 3. Overall characteristics of the band structure and the density of
states are found to be similar for all the GW methods
considered (Figures S3 and S4 of the Supporting Information). The characteristics of the band structure and
the density of states obtained from the GW calculations
are in good agreement with the DFT and hybrid DFT calculations with
the exception of the varying band gaps (Table 3), and hence, we are not repeating the discussion
here. Our calculated band gap for G0W0 (PBE+D3) is in good agreement with the optical
band gap reported from the experimental optical absorption, measured
in diffuse reflectance mode (1.90 eV).61 The G0W0 calculation on the HSE06+D3 geometry slightly overestimates the
experimental band gap. The partially self-consistent GW0 and the self-consistent GW approaches
also overestimate the band gap.

The GW results
appear confusing as what was expected
to be the poorest approach (G0W0/PBE+D3) gave the closest agreement with the
experiment. However, the impact of thermal effects on the electronic
structures can be significant. Wiktor et al. considered cubic CsPbX3 and CsSnX3 and observed large band gap renormalization
due to finite temperature.85 They concluded
that the effect of temperature will be expected to be smaller for
non-cubic phases and for perovskites containing organic molecules,
in which some disorder is already present at 0 K.85 Since CH3NH3GeI3 has a
noncubic symmetry and contains organic cations, we would expect that
this effect is small but may be a factor in the apparently poorer
self-consistent GW results. In addition, the quality
of G0W0 is
known to be very dependent on the starting electronic structure.86 This may explain why the poorer PBE+D3 electronic
structure gives rise to apparently better results due to the fortuitous
cancellation of errors with the thermal effect in G0W0/PBE+D3. Self-consistent GW has been found to significantly improve the situation
where the starting electronic structure is poor, which is illustrated
by GW/PBE+D3 giving a similar band gap to that obtained
using G0W0/HSE06+D3. Self-consistent GW has been found to
overestimate gaps,86 which is consistent
with the increase observed for G0W0/HSE06+D3. Here, the excellent starting point
gives rise to the more advanced GW techniques, giving
band gaps in poorer agreement with experiments than G0W0. van Schilfgaarde has
suggested that self-consistent GW suffers from the
inclusion of unphysical contributions, giving rise to an unreasonable W even for the electron gas87,88 that may lead
to this overestimation.89

The effective
masses of electrons are slightly lower than those
of holes (Table 3),
which suggest that the electron mobility of this material may be better
than the hole mobility as observed earlier in CH3NH3PbI3.67 The effective masses of CH3NH3GeI3 calculated using G0W0 (PBE+D3) (mh* = 0.145m0,me* = 0.122m0) are comparable with those of CH3NH3PbI3 (mh* = 0.180m0,me* = 0.163m0).83 The effective mass of electrons (me*) in silicon is
estimated to be 0. 19m0, and the effective
masses of heavy and light holes (mh*) are 0.54m0 and 0.15m0, respectively.90 Hence, the effective masses of CH3NH3GeI3 calculated by our highly reliable GW calculations are comparable to those of silicon used
in commercially existing solar cells, indicating potential for CH3NH3GeI3 to be used in solar cells. The
optical band gaps are in excellent agreement with the fundamental
band gaps showing strong symmetry-allowed transitions.

CH3NH3GeI3 exhibits a direct band
gap, indicating strong absorption as observed in the case of CH3NH3PbI3, and the characteristics of
their density of states are also similar. In CH3NH3PbI3, the top of the VB and the bottom of the CB
are predominantly of I(p) and Pb(p) characters, respectively, which
is in accordance with our observed results for CH3NH3GeI3 where the top of the VB is predominantly I(p)
and the bottom of the CB is predominantly of Ge(p) states. Nevertheless,
CH3NH3GeI3 exhibits a band gap of
1.90 eV, which is higher than that of the widely studied CH3NH3PbI3 (1.50 eV). According to the Shockley–Queisser
limit, an ideal solar cell absorber material is considered to be a
semiconductor with a direct optical band gap of approximately 1.50
eV.91 CH3NH3GeI3 with its larger band gap may be suitable for photovoltaic
applications as a top layer in a tandem solar cell that moderates
the efficiency losses by using multisemiconductor layers with different
band gaps. Replacement studies on CH3NH3GeI3 by various organic cations, halides, mixed halides, mixed
metals, and mixed organic cations could be useful for tuning the structural,
electrical, and optoelectronic properties. The capability of the GW calculations to reproduce the experimental results indicates
that this procedure could be used to predict the band gaps of germanium-based
hybrid halide perovskites, which show potential for applications in
solar cells. The systematic assessment of the performance of various
functionals in this work is expected to provide valuable guidance
in further theoretical investigations for tuning the optoelectronic
properties of CH3NH3GeI3.

Conclusions
The structure, electronic properties, and optical properties of
CH3NH3GeI3 were systematically investigated
using a range of theoretical methods. We have demonstrated that the
combination of PBE+D3 geometry and G0W0 calculations exhibits better agreement with
experimental values, in regard to both geometric and electronic structure.
The fundamental band gap of the CH3NH3GeI3 is direct in nature, and the density-of-states analysis indicates
that the valence band is predominantly made up of I(p) states, while
the conduction band consists primarily of Ge(p) states. The estimated
effective masses from our GW calculations are comparable
with those of CH3NH3PbI3 as well
as those of silicon used in commercial photovoltaic cells. The optical
band gaps obtained are identical to the fundamental band gaps, indicating
strong symmetry-allowed VBM-to-CBM transition. The characteristics
of the density of states and the effective masses of the charge carriers
of CH3NH3GeI3 are in agreement with
those of CH3NH3PbI3. The band gap
(1.90 eV) of CH3NH3GeI3 indicates
that it may be suitable for photovoltaic applications as a top layer
in a tandem solar cell. Ultimately, we believe that this work provides
a promising platform for unleashing the full potential of germanium-based
perovskites for photovoltaic applications in the future.

Computational
Methods
All calculations were performed within periodic boundary
conditions
through the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP),92,93 which employs the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method94,95 to describe interactions between the core and valence electrons.
We have calculated the convergence with respect to the k point and plane wave cutoff and found that an 8 × 8 ×
8 k point mesh and a 500 eV cutoff converge the energy
to within 0.001 eV per atom. Calculations were performed by using
different approaches toward treating the exchange and correlation
to investigate their suitability in describing the structural and
electronic properties. We performed calculations using the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE)96 and PBEsol, the revised version
of PBE solids, which is reported to give improved description of equilibrium
properties of solids.97 The PBE and PBEsol
functionals generally underestimate the band gap, which is often addressed
by using a hybrid density functional such as HSE06 of Heyd, Scuseria,
and Ernzerhof.98,99 There exists an ambiguity about
the role of dispersive interactions in determining structural properties
of organic–inorganic halide perovskites. Some of the theoretical
studies have shown that it is important to consider dispersive interactions
for providing reliable predictions of structural parameters of hybrid
halide perovskites.37,100,101 Bokdam et al. suggested van der Waals (vdW) dispersion interactions
did not improve the description of the material, while hybrid functionals
and the strongly constrained appropriately normed (SCAN) density functional
gave better results.102 However, the SCAN
functional has been suggested to already include some degree of short
range dispersion, making its results good.103 Hence, we have considered DFT methods
with and without D3 corrections and examined the geometric and electronic
structures. We have included van der Waals dispersion interactions
by employing the zero damping DFT-D3 method of Grimme to account for
the dispersion interactions.77 Thus, we
have employed PBE, PBEsol, HSE06, PBE+D3, PBEsol+D3, and HSE06+D3
functionals to study the structure and properties of CH3NH3GeI3. Geometry optimizations were performed
with force convergence criteria as 0.01 eV/Å, over a range of
constrained volumes, and the equilibrium cell volume was found by
fitting the energy–volume curve to the Murnaghan equation of
state,104 which minimizes the error associated
with the Pulay stress.105 Spin–orbit
coupling effects were not considered here as they have been shown
to be negligible in germanium-based hybrid perovskites.58,59 The Brillouin zone and the high symmetry points used to generate
band structures are taken from the handbook of Bradley and Cracknell.106 The optical absorption spectrum was computed
by using the transversal approximation and PAW method, which sums
the absorption spectra over all direct valence band (VB)-to-conduction
band (CB) transitions and therefore ignores indirect and intraband
absorption, which, despite ignoring excitonic effects, has given reasonable
optical absorption spectra70,93−98 and revealed if transitions are symmetry-allowed.79,107−112 We have performed quasiparticle GW calculations
by carrying out single-shot G0W0, partially self-consistent GW0, and the self-consistent GW.86,113−115 For all GW calculations,
we employed a plane wave cutoff of 500 eV, 512 bands (20 occupied
+ 492 unoccupied bands), 8 × 8 × 8 γ-centered k point grid, comprising 128 irreducible points. Convergence
tests were performed from 400 to 1000 bands with convergence at 512
bands of absolute energies of 0.1 eV with the band gap within 0.03 eV. GW band
structures were calculated by interpolating the wavefunction using
Wannier analysis as implemented in the Wannier90 code.116
