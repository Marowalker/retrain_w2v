Biocomposites from
bio-based poly(butylene succinate) (BioPBS)
and grape pomace (GP) were made by melt extrusion–injection
molding. Grape pomace is a low value byproduct from the wine industry
that can be utilized as a filler to increase its value and to decrease
the amount of polymer required in a composite blend. Experiments were
performed with up to 50% grape pomace by weight. Composites were also
compatibilized with in situ manufactured maleic anhydride-grafted
BioPBS (MA-g-BioPBS). Flexural and impact strength
were improved with the addition of GP up to the addition of 50 wt
% GP, suggesting that at this loading the formulation reached threshold
performance. The blend of (57:40:3) BioPBS/GP/MA-g-BioPBS showed the best overall performance in terms of a balance
of both mechanical properties and thermal properties. The increase
in impact resistance confirmed that the GP acted as a reinforcing
phase. The addition of 3 wt % MA-g-BioPBS in samples
containing 40 wt % of grape pomace resulted in improvements of 28.4
and 59% in flexural and impact strengths, respectively, compared to
neat BioPBS. Heat distortion temperature increased with the addition
of grape pomace by 14.3% in a blend combination of 57% BioPBS, 40%
grape pomace, and 3% MA-g-BioPBS compared to neat
BioPBS. Scanning electron microscopy results show improved interfacial
adhesion with the addition of MA-g-BioPBS and thermogravimetric
analysis results prove that the GP is thermally stable under the processing
conditions. This study shows that GP can be successfully incorporated
into a BioPBS matrix to create biocomposites with improved thermal
and mechanical properties.

Introduction
A report from the United Nations Environmental
Program in 2014
has estimated that the environmental cost of utilizing all synthetic
plastics is more than $75 billion USD per year. Food packaging is
the biggest contributor of plastic utilization at 23% of all costs.
Soft drink packaging is the second biggest contributor at 12%. The
total amount for both food packaging and soft drink packaging is 35%
or $26.3 billion USD per year.1

The
development of biodegradable and/or compostable materials among
others is envisioned as one of the most reliable alternatives to reduce
the environmental costs associated with traditionally used packaging.
The ideal materials to be developed for these purposes are mainly
composed of a biodegradable, compostable, or bio-based polymer matrix
and a bio-based filler and/or natural fibers. These new materials,
however, must comply with specific industrial quality requirements
for their commercialization, which are mainly focused on their mechanical
and thermal properties. In this scenario, a lot of research has been
done on creating environment-friendly alternatives with optimized
properties.2−4

Grape pomace (GP) is the main byproduct of
the wine and grape juice
industries. Current reports show that around 70–75% of the
total world annual production of grapes (∼50–60 million
tons) is used for the production of wine (∼27 billion liters
a year).5 The manufacturing of wine results
in approximately 20–25% of grape pomace.6 This byproduct contains mainly the skin, seeds, and stems
of the wine grapes and it is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose,
pectin, sugars, and small amounts of proteins, lipids, and polyphenolics.7 The improper disposal of GP results in a serious
and negative environmental impact. The pomace lacks the high amounts
of nitrogen required to be used as a suitable fertilizer, and it is
only used in small quantities as animal feed.6 The skin after pressing still contains high quantities of phenolic
compounds, antioxidants, and fiber, the stem contains tannins, while
the seeds are a potential source for the production of oil as well
as fiber.5 In general, most of the wine
industries in the disposal of their wastes due to high disposal fees
and transportation costs. While research activities aimed at finding
economically viable and safe routes of extraction of fine chemicals
and materials must be encouraged, alternative uses of industrial pomaces
should also be examined. GP can also be considered for the derivatization
of energy which can be obtained through thermo-chemical processing
or pyrolysis—yielding gaseous, liquid, as well as solid fuels,
and/or novel materials including bio-based plastics.8,9 This study is focused on the development of biocomposites based
on a biodegradable matrix and GP as a reinforcing filler.

There
are several biodegradable polymers that are currently being
used for composite production, such as polybutylene adipate terephthalate
(PBAT), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)
(PHBV), polylactic acid (PLA), and poly(butylene succinate) (PBS),
among others. PBS is an aliphatic, biodegradable, and sometimes bio-based
polyester that shows promise due to its good melt processability and
biodegradability when exposed to compositing conditions.10 It is a white thermoplastic polymer with a density
of 1.25 g/cm3, a glass transition temperature of −45
to −10 °C, a melting temperature of 90–120 °C,
it can be processed similarly to polyolefin at a range of 160–200
°C under controlled conditions.11 Its
tensile strength is between polyethylene and polypropylene, and its
stiffness is between high and low density polyethylene.11 PBS is advantageous over polyolefins because
of its good biodegradability, which can make it an attractive alternative
to other nonrenewable polymers.12 PBS can
be made from either petroleum-based chemicals or it can be partially
biobased with the succinic acid portion coming from biomass. Current
production of bio-based poly(butylene succinate) (BioPBS) has a bio
content of around 54% but there is potential to produce 100% bio-based
PBS in the future when bio-based 1,4-butanediol becomes commercially
available.13

PBS has a higher cost
compared to traditionally used petroleum
polymers that are nonbiodegradable.14 In
the particular case of composite formulations, the higher cost of
the polymers can be lowered with the addition of inexpensive fillers.
In addition to lowering costs, fillers also allow the modification
or enhancement of thermal properties and mechanical properties of
the polymer matrices. Furthermore, the addition of bio-based fillers
results in the production of bio-based or totally compostable materials.
Due to these advantages, a variety of different natural fillers have
been used to create green composites.13 Natural fillers have added advantages of being renewable, sustainable,
abundant, biodegradable, and low density, and they have satisfactory
specific properties when compared to mineral fillers like talc or
glass fiber.13 Although, there has been
a huge impact on research related to the use of wood fibers and/or
grass derived fibers,3,4,15 there
has been little work done on the use of fillers sourced from post-industrial
food processing; such as tomato, grape, or apple pomace.

Bio-based
fillers face basic challenges that can be overcome by
choosing the materials and processing methods wisely, the most common
include relatively low thermal stability, lack of filler–matrix
interaction, and higher water absorption when compared with synthetic
plastics.16 The thermal stability can be
an issue if the filler decomposes below the processing temperature
of the matrix, which was not the case in the composites made. Usually,
there are compatibility problems between the natural filler and matrix
because of their different polarities. This incompatibility between
the filler and matrix causes inferior properties when compared to
a neat polymer. There are two different ways to enhance the filler
and matrix. The first way is using chemical, physical, or biological
methods to modify the surface of the filler.17 The other method is to add a reactive compatibilizer into the system
to enhance the interfacial adhesion between the polymer matrix and
the biofiller.18 In natural filler composites,
maleic anhydride (MA) is grafted to functional polymers and is commonly
used as a reactive compatibilizer.19 MA
can form a chemical bond with free hydroxyl groups on the surface
of the filler in the composite.18 In addition
to improving the interfacial adhesion, water absorption decreases
because of the strong interfacial bonding between the filler and the
polymer matrix, therefore improving the dimensional stability.20

To date there has been no research done
on grape pomace BioPBS
composites, and no research done on utilizing all the components of
pomace. Spiridon et al. (2016)21,22 have used grape seeds
in different amounts in a polylactic acid (PLA) matrix, but no work
has been done with grape pomace in a PBS matrix. Jiang et al. (2010)
and Park et al. (2009) utilized grape skins in a soy flour matrix
and found that biodegradable composites could be created with the
incorporation of the grape skins. Both groups performed flexural tests
on such materials and showed good breaking strength results, however,
no other mechanical properties were tested.7,23 Due
to the lack of literature available on incorporation of all components
of grape pomace, we believe that there is an opportunity to create
a compostable grape pomace/BioPBS-based composite with good mechanical
properties for possible food packaging applications. In this study,
we investigate the mechanical, physical, morphological, and thermal
properties of composites manufactured with bio-based poly(butylene
succinate) (PBS) and GP. GP is used as an inexpensive filler and as
a source of reinforcing filler. We also provide a general analysis
of the chemical composition of the grape pomace used, compared to
the current published data.

Results and Discussion
Fourier Transform Infrared
(FTIR) Spectroscopy
The
FTIR curve of neat BioPBS and MA-g-BioPBS were examined,
as shown in Figure 1. At 1716 cm–1, the ester carbonyl (C=O)
group was seen as a stretching vibration.24 At 1045 cm–1 there was a band corresponding to
the stretching vibrations of the −O–C–C–
in BioPBS.25 The peaks at 2945 and 1330
cm–1 corresponded to symmetric and asymmetric deformational
vibrations from the −CH2– groups in the main
chains of PBS.26 The peaks at 918, 806,
and 654 cm–1 can be associated with the −C–OH
bending in the carboxylic acid group of PBS,25 the in-plane bending of the CH2 in OC(CH2)2CO, and the −COO bending bands, respectively.27 There is one new small peak present at 1781
cm–1 which can be attributed to the maleic anhydride
grafting onto the BioPBS.28 These peaks
correspond to the succinic anhydride group.28,29 The presence of these peaks further confirms that the MA has been
grafted onto the BioPBS backbone and has been reported within the
specialized literature.3 A strong −C–O–C
stretching peak is seen at 1151 cm–1, representing
an ester linkage. At 955 cm–1, the peak corresponds
to C–0 stretching, 806 cm–1 to the in plane
bending of the CH2 in OC(CH2)2CI,
and 644 cm–1 to the −COO bending as seen
in both BioPBS and MA-g-BioPBS.

BioPBS and MA-g-BioPBS.

Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
The TGA curve for
the grape pomace is smooth, without any peaks or dips (Figure 2a). This indicates that the
sample experienced decomposition with the formation of gaseous reaction
products.30 The onset temperature for thermal
degradation was lower for the composites than that of BioPBS due to
the grape pomace having lower thermal stability. The maximum degradation
point occurred at 343 °C for the grape pomace and 400 °C
for the BioPBS. In composites, these values are intermediate between
grape pomace and the matrix. The thermal profile shows higher amounts
of carbonaceous residues also containing the ash, as shown at the
end of the curve for samples containing the grape pomace. These results
are similar to rice husk flour and wood flour-filled PBS composites.31 In general, grape pomace can be safely incorporated
with a polymer with a relatively low melting point. Table 1 shows the temperature weight
loss values and 5 and 50% weight loss. It can be seen that the GP
is the first to lose 5% of its weight. This is to be expected because
it has a lower thermal stability than BioPBS. The composites show
a 5% weight loss in between that of GP and BioPBS. All the neat BioPBS
and composites showed similar temperatures for 50% weight loss, with
the compatibilized sample having a slightly higher temperature.

The onset of decomposition
can be easily seen from the derivative
weight curve (Figure 2b). In grape pomace there are three distinct peaks which can correspond
to decomposition of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. After moisture
evaporation, the degradation occurred around the 200–450 °C
range which indicates that the components removed are less thermally
stable. Hemicellulose degradation showed a peak around 267 °C,
cellulose around 340 °C and lignin, known for degrading over
a wide range of temperatures is from around 378 °C onwards. Khiara
et al. had similar results with hemicellulose and cellulose degrading
around 166–500 °C with a peak at 288 °C corresponding
to cellulose. They also showed that lignin had a degradation zone
from 362–500 °C.32 Yang et
al. found that hemicellulose degraded at 268 °C, cellulose at
355 °C, and that lignin degraded over a range, as seen by other
authors .33 Since the grape pomace only
starts degrading around 200 °C, it is processed at 140 °C
indicating that the pomace does not decompose during processing. The
onset temperature for thermal degradation was lower for the composites
than for neat BioPBS which can be attributed to the decreased thermal
stability of the grape pomace. For example, in the blend of BioPBS/GP
of (60:40) and BioPBS/GP/MA-g-BioPBS of (57:40:3)
the peak around 266 and 270 °C in the composite corresponds to
the addition of the grape pomace and the peak at 384 and 391 °C
corresponds to the BioPBS addition, respectively. The compatibilized
samples had slightly higher stability with peaks at 270 and 391 °C
which could be due to the compatibilizer. All the other composites
showed similar behavior, however, only one blend and compatibilized
blend was shown for simplicity.

Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
(DMA)
DMA was utilized
to determine the heat deflection temperature (HDT) of the blends,
as well as the viscoelastic properties of the composites. Storage
modulus (E′) is the ratio of oscillating stress
to applied strain, related to the elastic portion of a material. It
is measured in energy stored per cycle. Loss modulus (E″) is the shifted phase component relating to the viscous
portion of a material. The ratio of E″ to E′ yields the mechanical damping factor (tan δ).

Storage modulus values of green composites are influenced by the
dispersion of the filler in the matrix and by interfacial bonding
between phases. Figure 3a shows the E′ of BioPBS and the composites
between temperatures of −60 and 100 °C. E′ for the composites increased, comparatively to neat BioPBS
in all cases. This improvement could be due to the reinforcing effect
of the pomace. The compatibilized samples performed better than their
uncompatibilized counterparts. At E′ −30
°C, the samples showed a drastic reduction which can be related
to the Tg of BioPBS. The E′ continued to decrease when the temperature was increased
up to a temperature of 100 °C, when the test was stopped. The
decrease in E′ can be related to the molecular
motion/relaxation with increasing temperatures.3,34 The
degree of loss in the composite system was very similar to the neat
polymer. With increasing temperature, the composites went through
the glass transition zone of BioPBS and softened which can be seen
in the decrease in storage modulus. The highest E′ was seen in the 55:40:5 blend of BioPBS/GP/MA-g-BioPBS.

Figure 3 (a) E′ of BioPBS, BioPBS/GP, and BioPBS/GP/MA-g-BioPBS (b) tan δ (c) loss modulus (A) neat
BioPBS, (B) BioPBS/GP (60:40 wt %), (C) BioPBS/GP/MA-g-BioPBS (57:40:3 wt %).

The tan δ plot of BioPBS and the composites
with 40–50%
grape pomace filler can be seen in Figure 3b. The damping peak, near glass transition
is associated with partial relaxation of polymer chains which allows
small groups and chain segments to move.35 The tan δ height of all the composites was lower than
that of BioPBS and the peaks were widened. The decrease with filler
incorporation has been observed by many researchers, incorporating
natural fillers into biodegradable polymers.3,36,37 The height of the tan δ loss
factor d with the addition of the grape pomace filler
corresponds to the higher stiffness from the filler. This is also
seen with the increase in E′. The filler component
of the composite controls the strain and can reduce the strain on
the interface.38,39 This could explain the behavior
of the composites mentioned above. Also, the incorporation of the
pomace can reduce the amount of movement from the polymer molecules,
as shown in the decrease in the peak height. The increase in the storage
modulus with the addition of a biofiller, decrease in tan δ
peak height, and the shift in the glass transition temperature to
higher temperatures have all been recognized by many researchers.4,38−41 The shift in Tg is shown in Table 2 and Figure 3c.

HDT is the temperature where a material deflects at
least 0.25
mm under a load of either 0.455 or 1.82 MPa. It is an important measure
for the design of products and for practical applications. High values
typically are desired for composite applications. The HDT values of
neat BioPBS along with uncompatibilized and compatibilized samples
are shown in Table 1. The HDT of neat BioPBS was around 87 °C. The composites increase
in HDT values with higher filler percentages. The values remained
almost similar from 40 to 50% load of grape pomace showing that the
matrix reached a threshold (where additional loading would not benefit
the system and properties would start to decrease). This is confirmed
by the crystallinity values obtained for these samples showing lower
values in composites loaded with 50% pomace. The observed improvements
in HDT are attributed to the improved reinforcing/stiffness effect
that composites experience, as reported in the literature.15 The improved stiffness of the composites is
also shown in relation to the flexural and tensile modulus. The HDT
values of other BioPBS composites also increased such as PBS/Basalt
fibers (85:15 wt %) increasing from 82 to 114 °C,42 PBS/switchgrass (50:50 wt %) increased from
78 to 106 °C,34 and PBS/miscanthus
(50:50 wt %) increased from 90 to 116 °C.3 The compatibilized samples increased the HDT values slightly. The
improvement can be attributed to the increased interaction between
the matrix and the filler with the addition of compatibilizer. The
increase in storage modulus of the composites also agrees with the
increase in HDT values.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
DSC was used
to determine the effects of grape pomace on crystalline temperature
(Tc), crystalline enthalpy (ΔHc), melting temperature (Tm), melting enthalpy (ΔHm), and percentage crystallinity of BioPBS. The glass transition temperature
(Tg) of neat BioPBS and the composites
from the DSC curves could not be determined. Other literature on BioPBS
composites have used DMA to report Tg values,
not DSC, possibly for the same reason.43 The melting temperature, melting enthalpy, crystallization temperature,
crystallization enthalpy, and percentage crystallinity of BioPBS as
a neat polymer and composites can be seen in Table 3. The melting temperature of BioPBS was around
115 °C (in terms of the second melting peak) since BioPBS has
a double melting behavior of melting, recrystallization, and remelting.44 The melting temperature remained very similar
among all the composites as well, suggesting that the presence of
the grape pomace filler does not affect it. The crystallization temperature
of neat BioPBS was 91°C. The crystallization temperature decreased
slightly for uncompatibilized samples, but compatibilized samples
had crystallization similar to neat BioPBS. The crystallinity of the
samples was also very similar to that of BioPBS. Neat BioPBS had a
bimodal melting peak which can be attributed to melt crystallization
phenomena.3 The bimodal peak became less
distinct with the addition of grape pomace. The addition of compatibilizer
resulted in a slight melting peak after the cold crystallization peak
and endothermic melting peak which was not present in uncompatibilized
samples.

BioPBS and the composites prepared showed two distinct
endothermic
peaks which could be a result of the presence of different lamellar
thicknesses present in BioPBS and the composites.3 Double melting peaks can be observed in semi-crystalline
polymers and polymer blends and can be explained by melt recrystallization.45 The melting peaks shifted to slightly lower
temperatures with the addition of MA-g-PBS (Figure 4), although this
change is very subtle. This could be due to the presence of the MA
group.46 The presence of the MA group could
prevent lamella growth and nucleation leading to a more imperfect
crystal structure compared to uncompatibilized samples and neat BioPBS.46

The composites’ crystallinity was not substantially
altered
after the addition of grape pomace from 40 to 50 wt %, therefore,
the degradation of the green composites is expected to be similar
to neat BioPBS.47 Crystallization behavior
increased with the addition of the coupling agent at 40% pomace load
and it remained close to 35% even in composites manufactured at 50%
filler. Thus, the increase of crystallization and on the mechanical
properties can be clearly associated with the effects of the MA-g-BioPBS on and the matrix-filler interactions. In general,
the grape pomace particles act as nucleating agents, whose behavior
is promoted by the use of MA-g-BioPBS.

Mechanical
Properties
The mechanical properties of
composites are strongly affected by the filler type and content, the
interaction of the filler–matrix, and therefore, the overall
performance of the composites can be enhanced by using coupling agents.16Figure 5a,b shows tensile modulus and tensile strength of BioPBS/GP
composites with different filler loadings, with and without compatibilizer.
Neat BioPBS had a tensile strength of 40.7 MPa and a tensile modulus
of 0.74 GPa. The incorporation of grape pomace into the BioPBS matrix
decreased the tensile strength substantially. This can be explained
by the lack of interfacial interaction and incompatibility between
the grape pomace and BioPBS. The addition of 50% grape pomace in the
BioPBS matrix showed the biggest decrease in tensile strength with
a reduction of 60%. The tensile modulus depends on the amount of filler
added into the system. The tensile modulus increased with increasing
amounts of fillers up to a filler content of 50%. For example, the
blend of BioPBS/grape pomace/compatibilizer (45:50:5) had a tensile
modulus of 1.84 GPa, a value which is 246% higher than neat BioPBS.
Both tensile modulus and strength were improved with the addition
of MA-g-BioPBS (compatibilizer). Compatibilized samples
had a higher tensile strength than their uncompatibilized counterparts
which can be attributed to the improved interfacial interaction between
the composites. The enhanced filler–matrix is thought to be
from the grafted MA groups of the MA-g-BioPBS interacting
with the hydroxyl groups of the grape pomace; the BioPBS parts are
miscible with the BioPBS in the matrix through co-crystallization.48 The expected reaction between MA-g-BioPBS and grape pomace is shown in Figure 6, as proposed in refs (49, 50). The tensile modulus did not show any dramatic
improvement between the compatibilized and uncompatibilized samples.
This is consistent with PBS/miscanthus green composites and with PLA/wood
composites.3,51 The tensile strength of PBS/grape
pomace/MA was not significantly different between the 40 and 50% grape
pomace filler. The tensile strength also did not change with different
amounts of MA. The elongation at break percentage for neat BioPBS
was found to be around 119% (Figure 5a,c). With the addition of grape pomace into the BioPBS
matrix, the elongation at break dropped to 3.5–7%. The reduction
in elongation is a common occurrence in green composites because the
addition of filler reduces the molecular mobility of the polymer chains.4

The flexural properties of BioPBS grape pomace composites
with
different amounts of fillers, with and without compatibilizer can
be seen in Figure 7a. The flexural strength of neat BioPBS was 33.65 MPa and the flexural
modulus was 0.779 GPa. The flexural strength of all the composites,
comparatively to neat BioPBS, except for the blend of 50:50 BioPBS
grape pomace decreased slightly. Other researchers have attributed
the decrease in the properties to the high ash content of the grape
pomace in comparison to other fruit pomaces.23 The increased stiffness of the BioPBS matrix after the addition
of the GP filler is thought to be the reason for this increase. The
flexural strength of the composites improved slightly in samples with
40% filler, but it decreased with a filler content of 50%. The tensile
strength and flexural strength insignificantly change because the
MA-g-BioPBS acts as a toughening agent, and therefore,
increases the strength of the composites but not their ductility.
If the reactive sites on the BioPBS are fully consumed, then more
amounts of MA-g-BioPBS will not change the strength.52 The flexural modulus increased with the increasing
filler content up to 50% filler. The flexural modulus was further
improved with the addition of compatibilizer into the system. The
compatibilized samples had an improvement in flexural strength, but
the amount of filler did not seem to change the strength at 40 and
50% filler content. The flexural modulus showed very little difference
between compatibilized and uncompatibilized samples, which is a contrast
to the improvement in flexural strength with compatibilizer. Compared
to neat BioPBS, the biggest improvement in flexural modulus was the
BioPBS/grape pomace/compatibilizer (55:50:5 wt %) blend, with a flexural
strength of 45.6 MPa and a flexural modulus of 2.89 GPa. This results
in an increase of 135.5 and 371%, respectively. The improvements can
be associated with the reinforcing effect of grape pomace.

(47:50:3 wt %), and (H) BioPBS/GP/MA-g-BioPBS (45:50:5
wt %).

The Izod notched impact strength
of BioPBS, BioPBS/GP composites,
and compatibilized BioPBS/GP composites can be seen in Figure 7b. Neat BioPBS had an impact
strength of around 24 J/m. The impact strength of the BioPBS/GP composites
improved significantly with the addition of filler at 40% compared
to the neat BioPBS, however, at 50% filler the impact strength decreased
by a very slight amount. The impact strength was improved with the
addition of compatibilizer, but not drastically. The highest improvement
was seen in the BioPBS/grape pomace/compatibilizer (57:40:3 wt %)
blend. An impact value of 38.8 J/m was obtained, a 159% improvement
over neat BioPBS. The improvement can be attributed to enhanced adhesion
between components.53 The impact strength
started to decrease with a higher filler content, regardless if the
compatibilizer was present. The impact strength increased with the
addition of GP because it absorbed the energy transferred during the
test. GP reinforces the BioPBS matrix, allowing it to withstand more
added energy. With the higher addition of GP the matrix became overloaded,
and the GP started to behave as a stress concentration factor, causing
the impact strength to decrease.

Surface Morphology
The surface morphology of the grape
pomace, neat BioPBS, and composites were all examined to determine
the interfacial bonding between the filler and the matrix through
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The degree of grape pomace dispersion
in the matrix can also be determined. As shown in Figure 8A below, there are many different
structures found in the grape pomace. These can be broken down into
two separate categories: long, straw like particles, and round particles.
The straw like particles can be from the stems found in the pomace.
The round particles could be from the seeds of the grapes. The very
different morphologies of the pomace suggest that the pomace is not
completely uniform in composition.

Figure 8 Surface morphology of grape pomace at
2000× magnification.

SEM fracture surfaces of uncompatibilized composites as seen
in Figures 9A and 10A show interfacial gaps between the matrix and
filler and filler pull out from the filler–matrix. With the
increasing filler content, an increase in filler bundles/aggregates
were seen up to a filler content of 50 wt %. The morphology was more
uniform in the blend with lower amounts of GP (Figure 10A). Similar findings have been seen in PBS/miscanthus
composites,3 PLA/kenaf composites,53 PHBV/kenaf composites,54 PHBV/PLA/miscanthus composites,15 PBS/bamboo
composites,55 PBS/kenaf fiber composites,56 and PP/bioflour composites.57 Weak interfacial adhesion can cause debonding from the
matrix which can be seen in the fracture surface morphology. Figures 9B and 10B show the SEM fracture surface of compatibilized
BioPBS composites. The compatibilized composite does not show as much
filler pull out and it has good filler dispersion in the matrix due
to the improved interfacial adhesion. The compatibilized composite
has a more uniform appearance, which can be attributed to the addition
of compatibilizer. Each of the compatibilized samples have better
performance than the uncompatibilized samples with the same ratios
of BioPBS to GP due to the enhanced interfacial adhesion.57 Similar results have been seen for PBS/miscanthus
fiber composites as well.3

Conclusions
Grape pomace (GP), an abundant byproduct
of the wine industry was
used as a filler in a bio-based PBS matrix to increase its value and
to increase the sustainability of the BioPBS blends. GP-reinforced
BioPBS composites were prepared with various amounts of fillers, up
to 50% GP by weight. MA-g-BioPBS was successfully
grafted with a grafting level of 3.88%. TGA results show that the
GP was thermally stable at processing conditions. The use of a compatibilizer
enhanced both mechanical and thermal properties when compared to uncompatibilized
counterparts and neat BioPBS. Flexural and impact properties improved
with the addition of GP up to 50% by weight. The improvement in the
properties can be attributed to the enhanced interfacial interaction
between the GP filler, the BioPBS matrix, and the maleic anhydride-grafted
compatibilizer. A balance of both mechanical and thermal properties
was found with a blend of (57:40:3) BioPBS/GP/MA-g-BioPBS, indicating that a high level of GP can be successfully incorporated
into a polymer matrix. The interfacial interaction improvement was
confirmed by SEM analysis. Overall, this study shows that a food by
product can be utilized as a low-cost filler to create bio-based composites
with improved mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Grape pomace was obtained from Andrew Peller
Winery, Grimsby ON, Canada. Injection molding bio poly(butylene succinate)
(BioPBS) grade FZ71PM was purchased from PTT MCC Biochem Co., Ltd.,
Bangkok, Thailand. It has manufacturer specifications for density,
melt flow rate (at 190 °C/2.16 kg), melting point, yield stress,
strain at break, flexural modulus, flexural stress, and heat deflection
temperature (HDT), respectively, of 1.26 g/cm3, melt flow
index of 22 g/10 min, 115 °C, 40 MPa, 170%, 630 MPa, 40 MPa,
and 95 °C.58 Maleic anhydride purchased
from Acros Organics, and the initiator, Luperox 101 (2,5-bis(tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane) technical grade, purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, were used in compatibilization.

Composite Fabrication
Grape
Pomace Preparation and Conditioning
Grape pomace
was air-dried inside a laboratory fume hood for 6 days until the moisture
content of the grape pomace was around 2.5%. The pomace was then milled
using a 1 mm sieve on a Retsch ZM 200 grinding machine at 6000 rpm
(Retsch GmbH, Germany). The pomace was then dried overnight in an
oven at 60 °C before reaching a final moisture content of below
2.5%. It was sealed in zip lock plastic bags and kept below zero for
further processing.

Maleic Anhydride Grafting Reaction
The coupling agent
was in-lab synthesized by reactive extrusion using BioPBS, maleic
anhydride (MA), and Luperox as initiators. The BioPBS was used and
dried to 1% or less before processing according to manufacturer recommendations
for this process. These components were mixed by hand in a closed
container until reaching a homogeneous mixture. This reactive extrusion
was performed in a twin-screw extruder, Leistritz Micro-27, having
a length to diameter ratio (L/D)
48:1 and 27 mm screw diameter (Leistritz advanced technologies corp.).
The ratio of reactants was of 5% of MA and 1% of initiator based on
the total weight of the polymer. The temperature profile was 160 °C
at a feeding rate of 4 kg/h which was controlled through a balanced-feed
mechanism. The screw speed was 60 rpm in a co-rotating configuration.
Strands were produced using a die with openings of 3 mm and cooled
using a water bath, and pelletized and vacuum dried to remove the
free maleic anhydride before composite manufacturing.

Purification
of Maleic Anhydride-Grafted Bio-PBS and Maleic
Anhydride Grafting Percentage
Purification of MA-g-BioPBS was performed following a modified procedure.59 To ensure that unreacted maleic anhydride was
removed, it was vacuum dried at 80 °C for 3 days. For the test,
the vacuum dried MA-g-BioPBS was then dissolved in
50 mL chloroform. The MA-g-BioPBS was then selectively
precipitated in methanol and filtered. The filtered samples were then
dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 24 h.

Back-titration was
performed to determine the amount of maleic anhydride grafting onto
the BioPBS backbone, following a modified method from Nabar et al.59 Approximately 1 g of purified MA-g-BioPBS was dissolved in 50 mL of chloroform at room temperature
for 2 h. The free grafted maleic anhydride groups potentially found
in the solution were then hydrolyzed with the addition of eight drops
(2 μL) of water at room temperature. The solution was then titrated
with 0.1 N KOH solution and five drops of phenolphthalein were added
as an indicator. The MA-g-PBS is soluble in chloroform
and did not precipitate out of the solution during titration with
KOH. The grafting percentage was calculated as follows 1  where VKOH is
the volume of KOH in liters, NKOH is the
normality of KOH solution, W is the weight of MA-g-BioPBS in grams, and 98.06 is the molecular weight of
MA in g/mol. The grafting level of the MA-g-BioPBS
was 3.88%. The grafting was higher than that calculated by Muthuraj
et al. at 2.56%,3 which can be due to the
different source of PBS.

Composite Preparation
Grape pomace
was dried overnight
at 80 °C prior to processing and the BioPBS according to manufacturer
recommendation. The moisture content of the GP was less than 2% after
drying. The biocomposites were prepared through an extrusion–injection
molding process by using a DSM Xplore 15 cm3 micro compounder
and micro 12 cm3 injection molding machine (The Netherlands).
The extruder has three independent control heating zones, with twin
screws of 150 mm length and an aspect ratio of 18. Compounding was
done with the following parameters: a screw speed of 100 rpm, processing
temperature of 140 °C in all heating zones, with a residence
time of 2 min. All the samples were formed with a mold temperature
of 30 °C, with an averaged injection pressure of 10 bar, and
injection holding time of 20 s. The PBS/GP composites were made with
up to 50% GP filler and 5% MA-g-PBS. Blends of 20,
25, 30, 40, and 50% GP were prepared. Compatibilized samples of 40
and 50% grape pomace were made with 1, 3, and 5% MA-g-BioPBS, only 3 and 5% were made for 50% GP.

Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (Nicolet 6700, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
was used on an infrared-attenuated total reflectance mode (FTIR-ATR).
The analysis was performed by plotting transmittance versus wavenumber
in the range of 4000–400 cm–1 with 128 consecutive
scans at a resolution of 2 cm–1 under an air atmosphere.

Thermal Analysis
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was
performed by using a TA instrument (TGA Q500, TA Instruments) and
according to ASTM E1131-08. The grape pomace, BioPBS, and BioPBS/GP
composites were placed into a platinum pan and heated to 800 °C
at a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen environment.
The tests were performed in duplicates. The data was analyzed using
a software from TA Instruments, Universal Analysis 2000, version 4.5A.

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) (DMA Q800, TA Instruments) was
used to determine the heat deflection distortion temperature (HDT)
under the three-point bending setting, following the standard ATSM
D648. Injection molded samples were tested until they reached a distortion
of 250 μm. The results were done in duplicates. DMA was also
used to determine the temperature dependent storage modulus (E′), as per ASTM standard D4065. The heating ramp
rate for this test was of 3 °C/min. E′
measurements were determined in dual cantilever mode with a strain
of 1 Hz and 15 μm oscillating amplitude. All tests were first
stabilized at −50 °C for 5 min before being heated in
the thermal spectral range of −50–100 °C. These
tests were performed in an air atmosphere in duplicates.

Differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed using a DSC
Q200, TA Instruments. For each sample, between 5 and 10 mg of sample
was sealed in an aluminum pan, which was heated from room temperature
to 180 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and held at that temperature
for 2 min, then cooled to −60 °C with liquid nitrogen
at a rate of 5 °C/min and held for 2 min, before a second heating
scan to 180 °C at 10 °C/min. The nitrogen flow was kept
at 50 mL/min throughout the test. The samples were dried overnight
prior to testing. Two duplicates were prepared of each sample. Three
cycles were run to erase the thermal history from the first cycle.
The second heating cycle and first cooling cycle were used for analysis
and tests were done in duplicates.

The percent crystallinity
of the neat BioPBS was calculated as
follows 2  The percentage of crystallinity of the composites
were calculated as follows 3  where ΔHc is the crystallization enthalpy of the composite sample, ΔHmo is the theoretical melting enthalpy of 100% crystalline PBS, assumed
to be 200 J/g and Wf is the weight fraction
of the grape pomace in the composites.43,60Equation 3 was used to calculate the
crystallinity of the composites because the percentage of GP added
is taken into consideration.

Mechanical Testing
The mechanical
properties of the
composites were tested using an Instron Universal Testing Machine
(Instron-3382, Massachusetts). Type IV specimens were tested according
to ASTM D638-14 with a test speed of 5 mm/min for the composites and
50 mm/min for the neat BioPBS at 50% relative humidity. Flexural properties
were tested according to ASTM D790-15 procedure B, with a crosshead
speed of 14 mm/min and a span length of 52 mm, in the three-point
bending mode. Izod Notched impact properties were tested using ASTM
D256-10. The impact tester used was a TMI monitor impact tester (Testing
machine Inc. DE). The test was performed at room temperature by using
a 6.779 J (5 ft.ib) pendulum.

Surface Morphology
Scanning electron microscopy was
performed with a Phenom ProX (Phenom World BV, Netherlands) on the
grape pomace to visualize the shape and structure of the particles.
Fracture surface morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) on a Phenom ProX (Phenom World BV, Netherlands) equipped with
back scattering electron at 10 kV acceleration voltage. The samples
used for the SEM images were fractured with a pendulum hammer to provide
a cross section for imaging.
