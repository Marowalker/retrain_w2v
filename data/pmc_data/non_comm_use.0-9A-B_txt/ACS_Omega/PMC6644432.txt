1 Introduction
Fully
understanding an industrial process is of great importance
when process improvements are to be made.1 Small quantities of byproducts formed in a reaction, which on a
laboratory scale synthesis are neglectable, become important to minimize
when the reaction takes place on a ton-scale on a daily basis. From
an industrial perspective, it is therefore important to fully understand
how byproducts are formed in a given process. With such knowledge
in hand, it could be possible to alter the reaction conditions to
diminish the byproduct formation, or even better, remove them totally.

X-ray-contrast agent iodixanol (Figure 1) can be prepared by several methods.2−4 If amide 2 is used as the starting material under basic
conditions, its anion would react with epichlorohydrin, a reagent
in the reaction, to give epoxide 1 as an intermediate
in a two-step process. Because of the reactive nature of epoxides,5 and the presence of several nucleophilic sites
in amide 2, epoxide 1 could potentially
be a precursor for the formation of several minor byproducts in addition
to the major and desired product iodixanol.

Figure 1 Structure of iodixanol,
epoxide 1, and amide 2.

Previous results have shown that amide 2 is
present
in two anionic forms, compounds 2a and 2b (Figure 2a), upon
treatment with base where anion 2a is the dominating
species.6 Anion 2b can react
with epoxide 1, which results in the formation of the
imidate byproduct depicted in Figure 2b. The formation of the imidate has previously been
proved experimentally.6 Another plausible
pathway to this product could be via the intermediate, as shown in Figure 2c. This byproduct
and other byproducts1 are then removed
from crude iodixanol during work-up and purification processes, resulting
in pure iodixanol.

Figure 2 (a) Two anionic forms of amide 2; (b) byproduct
formed
if epoxide 1 reacts with the anionic form of amide 2; and (c) potential intermediate from the reaction between
anionic amide 2 and epichlorohydrin.

Epoxide 1 is expected to have a short lifetime
under
the reaction conditions, and its isolation from the reaction mixture
is therefore not a viable option when substantial amount of material
is needed for reactivity studies and for studies directed toward elucidating
its role in byproduct formation. Herein, we communicate our synthetic
approach for the preparation of epoxide 1, which also
allowed us to confirm its presence in small amounts during iodixanol
synthesis when amide 2 is used as starting material.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
Initially,
we attempted
a protection group-free synthesis of epoxide 1 by performing
a regioselective N-alkylation7 of the acetamide
moiety within substrate 2, followed by a direct epoxidation
of the resulting alkene by a Prileschajew reaction.5 However, to our disappointment, we quickly ended up with
solubility problems of the material under solvent conditions required
to conduct the necessary synthetic transformations. To get around
the solubility issue, protection of the free hydroxyl groups was inevitable.

Substrate 2 was therefore converted to the tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl (TBS)-protected product 3 in 96% yield, utilizing standard reaction conditions (Scheme 1).8 The TBS protection group was thought to be suitable for
the chemistry required for the formation of epoxide 1 and, at the same time, to be relatively easy to remove in the final
step, utilizing a global deprotection strategy. Silyl ether 3 was then subjected to a regioselective N-alkylation of the
acetamide, resulting in the formation of the desired alkene 4 in 90% isolated yield.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Pathway toward Epoxide 1
Attempts to convert
substrate 4 directly to epoxide 7 upon oxidation
by m-CPBA in a range of
solvents9 and with hydrogen peroxide in
glycine buffer10 were all unsuccessful.
A more labor-intensive route was therefore required to prepare the
target epoxide. Thus, alkene 4 was subjected to an Upjohn
dihydroxylation in acetone/water (6:1) resulting in a clean conversion
to the corresponding diol 5 (96% yield).11−13

Treating glycol 5 with methanesulfonyl chloride
(MsCl)
under conditions described by O’Donnel and Burke14 gave predominant mesylation of the primary hydroxyl
group, resulting in the isolation of mesylate 6 in 73%
yield. In addition, 10% of the product resulting from mesylation of
both hydroxyl groups (compound 8 in Scheme 1) was isolated from the reaction.
The 1H and 13C NMR chemical-shifts for the mesyl
groups in compounds 6 and 8 were in good
agreement with literature reports for similar compounds.14−16 Treating compound 6 with 2 M NaOH (aq) in ether at
room temperature, according to the Izuhara and Katoh procedure,17 resulted in the formation of epoxide 7 (70% isolated yield) over the course of 1 h. Finally, subjecting
substrate 7 to tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in
tetrahydrofuran (THF) at room temperature gave target compound 1 in 86% isolated yield after a tedious purification process,18 which involved three rounds of flash chromatography
to fully remove all salt from the product. Attempts to remove salts
and excess TBAF from the product by using a mix of mildly acidic Ca2+ and basic ion-exchange resins were only partly successful,19 and unfortunately also resulted in significant
loss of product.

Epoxide 1 was found to be stable
under neutral conditions
and when stored neat. However, when exposed to acidic conditions,
the epoxide underwent ring opening readily. Comparing the high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatograms of compound 1 prepared herein and the reaction mixture during industrial production
of iodixanol enabled us to confirm that epoxide 1 was
indeed present in small quantities during the preparation of iodixanol
(see Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information), thus opening up for potentially being the precursor of byproducts
formed during production. Interestingly, we also found that epoxide 1 partly ring-opens to iohexol (Figure 3) on the analytical HPLC column.

iohexol.

2.2 Rotational
Conformation
The predominant
rotational conformation of the acetamide bond CO–N in compounds 2 and 3 was in the endo-form, where the carbonyl
moiety is directed toward the ring, as shown in Figure 4.20 However, the
most favored rotational isomer of the alkylated acetamide in compounds 4–7 and 1 was the exo-form. The exo-conformation
is also the dominating species in iohexol, where the acetamide is
alkylated.21 Isomerism of all compounds
was determined by the split acetyl signal in 1H NMR into
one major and one minor peak, with the endo-peak positioned downfield
of the exo-peak, because of ring-current effects.22 For compound 3, the endo-/exo-peaks were positioned
at chemical shifts 2.01 and 1.58 ppm in a 27:1 ratio, respectively,
and the equivalent peaks for compound 4 were located
at 2.18 and 1.73 ppm in a 1:20 ratio (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Endo-/exo-isomerism of
the acetamide attached to the triiodinated
benzene ring.

1H NMR analysis
conducted at 400 K (127 °C) showed
that rotation of the amide bond was more restricted in compound 4 (containing a tertiary acetamide moiety) compared with compound 3. At 400 K, the endo- and exo-peaks in compound 3 overlapped forming one broad singlet. However, for alkene 4, the endo- and exo-peaks remained separated, with an endo-/exo-ratio
of 1:7 at 127 °C, compared to a ratio of 1:20 obtained at room
temperature. Further evidence of rotational isomerism was observed,
but not investigated, in this work. For more information on the subject,
we refer to relevant literature on the topic.20−23

3 Conclusions
Epoxide 1 was prepared over six synthetic steps with
an overall yield of 25% using a strategy, where the hydroxyl groups
were protected with TBS groups. Our synthesis of compound 1 enabled us to confirm the presence of epoxide 1 in
the reaction mixture in small quantities during the synthesis of iodixanol
making compound 1 a potential starting point for byproduct
formation. Work is now going on in these laboratories to study whether
compound 1 is involved in the byproduct formation when
iodixanol is synthesized from amide 2.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General
All commodity
chemicals and
reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without
further purification. Petroleum ether (pet. ether, 40–65 °C)
was used for column chromatography. Silica gel NORMASIL 60 40–63
μm was used for flash chromatography. Proton (1H)
and carbon (13C) NMR spectra were acquired at 20 °C.
Proton and carbon NMR spectra were recorded using an Ascend 400 NMR
spectrometer from Bruker (Ascend 400), operating at 400 and 100 MHz.
NMR spectra are referenced to residual dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (δ
2.50 ppm, 1H; δ 39.52 ppm, 13C). 1H NMR data are recorded as follows: chemical shift (δ)
[multiplicity, coupling constant(s) J (Hz), and relative
integral] where multiplicity is reported as: s = singlet; d = doublet;
t = triplet; q = quartet; quint = quintet; dt = doublet of triplet;
m = multiplet; and bs = broad singlet. For 13C NMR spectra,
the data are given as chemical shift (δ), (protonicity), where
the number of protons is defined as: C = quaternary (where ArC = quaternary
aromatic carbon); CH = methyne; CH2 = methylene; and CH3 = methyl. The assignment of signals in various NMR spectra
was often assisted by correlation spectroscopy (COSY), nuclear Overhauser
effect and exchange spectroscopy, heteronuclear single quantum COSY,
and/or heteronuclear multiple bond COSY. Analytical HPLC was performed
on an Agilent 1100 or a TSP (Thermo Separation products) instrument
with UV detection at 254 nm using an RP-18 column (YMC 150 ×
4.6 mm, 5 μm). The following linear gradient program with mixtures
of water (A) and acetonitrile (B) as eluent was applied. Program:
3.0% B (0–2.7 min), 3.0–7.2% B (2.7–5.5 min),
7.2% B (5.5–16.5 min), 7.2–13.0% B (16.5–19.5
min), 13.0–45.0% B (19.5–26.5 min), 45.0% B (26.5–31.5
min). The flow rate was 1.25 mL/min. No acid was mixed with the eluents
unless otherwise stated. The amount of each component is given in
percentage, based on its relative area.

To a solution of mesylate 6 (6.5 g, 4.8 mmol)
in Et2O (150 mL) was added NaOH (10 mL, 2 M aq). After
stirring for 23 h at room temperature, the mixture was extracted with
Et2O (100 mL × 2). The extract was washed with water
(75 mL) and dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated.
The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography (petroleum
ether/EtOAc, 3:1). Concentration of the fractions with Rf = 0.22 (petroleum ether/EtOAc 7:3) yielded 4.2 g (70%
yield) of epoxide 7 as white crystals, mp 119–120

To a solution of epoxide 7 (1.64 g, 1.3 mmol)
in THF
(35 mL) was added 1 M TBAF in THF (7.2 mL, 7.2 mmol, 5.5 equiv). After
2 h, the solvent was removed by vacuum. Three subsequent purifications
using flash column chromatography EtOAc/MeOH (3:1) (Rf = 0.26) yielded 895 mg (86% yield) of epoxide 1 as a white powder, mp 285 °C (dec). IR (KBr) νmax: 3343, 2926, 2350, 1730, 1650, 1429, 1393, 1347, 1316,
