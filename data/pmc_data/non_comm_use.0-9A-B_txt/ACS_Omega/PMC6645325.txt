A sensor
for the determination of diols using 3-aminophenylboronic
acid (APBA)-functionalized hyper-cross-linked polypyrene (PPy) (APBA@PPy)
is presented. The uniform (∼1 μm in diameter) and highly
porous (628 m2 g–1 in specific surface
area) PPy spheres are fabricated via a one-pot protocol that consists
of ZnBr2-catalyzed alkylation of pyrene, a subsequent cross-linking
reaction, and concomitant self-assembly. The PPy spheres formed within
a few minutes at mild conditions are featured by an excellent structural
integrity and inertness to organic solvents. Thus, the APBA@PPy composites
(∼1 μm in diameter; 458 m2 g–1 in specific surface area) are prepared simply by substituting unreacted
bromomethyl groups on the surface of PPy spheres for APBA. The APBA@PPy
composites are successfully applied for the electrochemical sensing
of d-glucose and dopamine. A dye displacement assay is also
performed using alizarin red dye conjugated to boronic acid in glucose
buffer solution.

Introduction
Dynamic interactions
between boronic acid and diols (normally saccharide
or catechol species such as glucose and dopamine) have fueled the
development of a group of boronic acid-functionalized materials with
many applications. Since the inceptive report of covalent bonding
and reversible formation of cyclic ester linkages between boronic
acid and diols in 1954,1 boronic acid-functionalized
species have been applied in drug delivery systems,2−4 cell encapsulation,5 catalysis,6 separation
materials,7,8 battery electrochemistry,9 etc. Moreover, boronic acid-functionalized compounds have
been widely used as detection tools for chemo/biosensing of diol-containing
biomolecules, such as saccharides, dopamine, and glycoproteins.10−13 The Lewis acidic nature of trigonal boron and the rapid self-assembly
of these species have been exploited in the development of anion receptors
and sensors.14,15 Boronic acid has also been used
as a colorimetric competitive binding sensor in dye displacement assays
(DDAs), where an analyte displaces a dye from the receptor; this results
in a detectable color change that can be used to quantify the analyte.
Boronic acid has been combined with 1,2-diols containing alizarine
red S (ARS) for competitive binding assays.16,17 For example, the anion-intermediated binding of alizarin red to
boronic acids has been used to determine analyte anions in a given
system.18,19

So far, many ligands with boronic
acid groups immobilized on a
solid phase, such as magnetic nanoparticles,20 mesoporous silica,21 gold nanoparticles,22 and polymer nanoparticles,23 have been developed for solid-phase extraction of glycopeptides
and glycoproteins,24 carbohydrate recognition,25 specific detection,26,27 or transport.28,29 Boronic acid-functionalized polymers
have also been used for nucleotide isolation30 and drug delivery.31 Phenylboronic acid-grafted
nanoparticles maintain their binding capacity and selectivity.32 Recently, boronic acid-functionalized polymeric
microspheres have received attention in materials science. These microspheres
can be made by a simple and an easily upscalable method for interaction
with a variety of diols, where the binding energy for interaction
of the diols with boronic acid varies. Glucose microspheres have also
been studied on a wider scale than boronic acid microspheres.33

Polyaromatics (PArs)-based hyper-cross-linked
polymers are microporous
spherical materials synthesized by the polymerizations of low cost
aromatic monomers with good reproducibility and upscalability. The
extensive cross-linking induced during the polymerization and the
concomitant self-assembly lead to form hyper-cross-linked polyaromatic
(PAr) spheres with permanent porosity and help to prevent from subsiding
into a nonporous state.34,35

In this study,
our interest was to produce 3-aminophenylboronic
acid (APBA)-functionalized PAr. Initially, we have synthesized PArs
by self-polymerization of aromatic hydrocarbons, such as, naphthalene
(Np), anthracene (At), and pyrene (Py) via a simple one-pot two-step
reaction, that is, Friedel–Crafts alkylation using bromomethyl
methyl ether (BME) followed by cross-linking reactions.36 The PAr spheres formed in the early stage of
cross-linking are physically stable and permit the rapid filtration
of liquids, such as excess reagents, inert to all reagents and solvents,
and bear various pores used to allow for penetration of the reagents.
Furthermore, the unreacted bromomethyl groups present on the surface
of PAr spheres were utilized for the functionalization of APBA and
used the resultant APBA-functionalized hyper-cross-linked PAr (APBA@PAr)
as a new platform for the sensing of glucose, dopamine, and the dye
displacement assay. Because of the excellent electronic properties
and redox stability,37 we have used pyrene
as PAr precursor in the entire study and in the sensing study of diols
compared with other PArs, such as polyanthracene (PAt) and polynaphthalene
(PNp).

Results and Discussion
Fabrication and Characterizations of APBA@Polypyrene
(PPy)
The pyrene molecule is a valuable component for materials,
supramolecular,
and biological chemistry, due to its photophysical/electronic properties
and extended rigid structure. The electrophilic substitution of pyrene
is well-known and is known to take place regioselectively at the 1-,
3-, 6-, and 8-positions,39 which are the
most electron-rich centers. Thus, the alkylation of pyrene using BME
in the presence of ZnBr2 results in bromomethyl-substituted
intermediates, most probably at the four positions, as shown in Scheme 1. Further reactions
firstly yield linear PPy matrices; however, they quickly form cross-linked
PPy networks that are insoluble in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE). White
precipitates were observed in the reaction mixture within 5 min of
the reaction at 40 °C, demonstrating that the alkylation, polymerization,
and intermolecular cross-linking proceeded simultaneously very fast
at employed conditions. Microscopic measurements of the samples periodically
taken from the reaction mixture showed that the PPy microspheres were
formed at the early stage of cross-linking reactions. The particle
size and its distributions observed in this stage remain almost unchanged
even after the long reaction time, say 24 h.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration
of the Fabrication of APBA@PPy Composite via
the Polymerization of Pyrene, Followed by a Postmodification Reaction
of PPy with APBA Using Bromomethyl Groups on the PPy
As illustrated in Scheme 1, micropores are generated by the methylene-bridged
intermolecular
cross-linking reactions of PPy chains. The resultant insoluble PPy
networks may self-assemble into microspheres by supramolecular interactions,
such as π-stacking and CH−π interactions. As a
result, the PPy microspheres may also bear meso- and macropores, which
allow for penetration of the reagents. Figure 1a shows the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of the PPy obtained from 30 min of polymerization. Uniform
microspheres with a particle size of about 1 μm are intrinsically
fabricated without using any templates. In addition, the total specific
surface area measured by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
analysis was 628 m2 g–1 (see Figure 1c), demonstrating
that the PPy are highly porous, as expected.

(SEM) images of (a) PPy and (b) APBA@PPy,
and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore-size distribution
curves (insets) of (c) PPy and (d) APBA@PPy.

In addition to facile fabrication, it is interesting to note
that
there are unreacted bromomethyl groups on the surface of PPy. The
concentration of these groups is tunable by controlling the polymerization
conditions because it depends on the degree of cross-linking. As the
chloromethyl groups on the Merrifield resin can be used for further
functionalization,40 these bromomethyl
groups must be very useful for the further expansion of various chemistries.
For example, the APBA@PPy composite was obtained by simply reacting
APBA with the slurry of PPy at 30 °C for 24 h. Physically stable
integrity of the starting PPy results in no conspicuous changes in
the textural morphology, as shown in Figure 1b. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherm reveals that APBA@PPy (Figure 1d) retains its permanent porosity with a BET surface
area of 458 m2 g–1, which is slightly
less than that of PPy. Both PPy and APBA@PPy samples are characterized
by uniform pore-size distributions, as shown in the BJH pore-size
distribution profiles in Figure 1c,d (insets).

The existence of bromomethyl groups
on the PPy and their covalent
modification with APBA could be traced using the Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra (Figure 2a). The characteristic C–H (in −CH2Br) peak of PPy was evidenced by the wagging vibration at
1190 cm–1 and the C–Br stretching vibration
at 750 cm–1. Successful immobilization of APBA on
the surface of PPy was evidenced by the presence of a B–O stretching
mode at 1326 cm–1 and the presence of a vibration
mode at 1250 cm–1, corresponding to C–N stretching
vibrations. The covalent conjugation APBA on the PPy surface is also
confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopy (Figure 2b). The characteristic strong absorption
bands of the APBA molecule at 235 and 294 nm41 are also observed from the as-prepared APBA@PPy sample, indicating
that APBA was successfully attached onto the PPy surface. Moreover,
the fluorescence spectra of PPy and APBA@PPy samples (Figure 2c) show that the emission peak
of PPy at 505 nm due to pyrene rings in PPy shift to 485 nm for APBA@PPy.
The blue shift of the peak must be induced by the coordination of
APBA onto the surface of PPy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) profile (Figure 2d) of as-prepared APBA@PPy shows signals of B 1s at 189 eV, C 1s
at 284 eV, N 1s at 400 eV, and O 1s at 532 eV, clearly indicating
the functionalization of PPy by APBA.21 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was also used to assess the relative
composition of APBA-modified PPy. The TGA curve (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information (SI)) of APBA@PPy
shows that a minor mass loss of ∼4% is observed due to the
covalently conjugated APBA fragments. This approximate mass percentage
of immobilized APBA is similar to the percentage of APBA determined
by the XPS analysis. Employing the same procedure, APBA@PAr composites
were also successfully obtained by using Np and At as a starting materials,
as shown in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and UV–vis
spectroscopy (Figure S2 in the SI).

and APBA@PPy, and the XPS spectrum of APBA@PPy with its expanded spectra

Electrochemical Characterization of APBA@PPy
Pyrene
is perhaps the most widely studied member of the polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon family, which is made up of four fused aromatic rings
with a large π electron system. Moreover, pyrene has optimum
electrochemical redox stability compared to that of other molecules.37 In the present study, we have explored the success
of incorporating electrochemical properties of pyrene into porous
polymers. These polymers are entirely composed of sp2-hybridized
carbons bridging with sp3-hybridized CH2 groups,
conferring good thermal, chemical stability, and electrical conductivity.
The good electrochemical and kinetic performance may also be attributable
to the high surface area and different porosities of PArs.

As
a fundamental electrochemical study, the oxidation of ferrocyanide
[Fe(CN)6]4– to ferricyanide [Fe(CN)6]3– in an aqueous system served as a standard
reaction, specifically at carbon electrodes, where there is a minimum
bonding interaction between electrodes and electrolyte ions.42 The [Fe(CN)6]4–/[Fe(CN)6]3– redox process involves
in a transfer of a single electron and exhibits quasireversible outer
sphere kinetic behaviors under the circumstance that the electron
transfer is less resistant. Initially, the electrochemical activity
of as-synthesized PPy and APBA@PPy was determined by analyzing the
electrochemical reaction involving [Fe(CN)6]4– and [Fe(CN)6]3–. The electrochemical
activity of the modified electrodes was compared with that of a bare
glassy carbon (GC) electrode (GCE). The cyclic voltammograms (CVs)
of the [Fe(CN)6]4–/[Fe(CN)6]3– redox couple using different electrodes are
shown in Figure 3a.

behaviors of APBA@PPy-coated glassy carbon electrodes
in ferricyanide solution: (a) cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles of
(i) APBA@PPy, (ii) PPy, and (iii) bare glassy carbon in ferricyanide
solution (5 mM in 0.1 M of KCl) at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1; (b) CV profiles of APBA@PPy in ferricyanide solution (5 mM in 0.1
M of KCl) at different scan rates; (c) linear relationships of the
peak current vs square root of the scan rate of APBA@PPy and bare
GC; and (d) CV profiles of (i) APBA@PPy, (ii) PPy, and (iii) bare
GCE in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.1 M, pH 7.4) at the scan
rate of 100 mV s–1.

Oxidation peaks corresponding to the oxidation of [Fe(CN)6]4– and reduction peaks corresponding to
the reduction
of [Fe(CN)6]3– on the GCE electrode were
observed at 0.23 and 0.15 V, respectively. However, the peak current
for the APBA@PPy-modified GCE was comparatively higher than that of
the bare GCE. This is probably due to the large surface area of the
APBA@PPy coating as well as enhanced diffusive mass transport of the
ferrocyanide reactant to the PPy surface as compared to the case of
the uncoated one. Detailed electrochemical characterizations were
conducted for the [Fe(CN)6]4–/[Fe(CN)6]3– redox process on APBA@PPy electrodes.
For cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles, the cathodic peak current increases
with the scan rates, as shown in Figure 3b, and there exists a linear relationship
(r2 = 0.9958) between the peak current
and square root of the scan rate, as shown in Figure 3c, which indicates that the redox reaction
is diffusion-controlled.43 The surface
charge of the APBA@PPy analyzed from the ζ potential was +0.55.
In addition, the CV of positively charged particles in Ru(NH3)63+ solution indicated that there existed
electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged redox species
and the positively charged APBA@PPy (Figure S3 in SI). Furthermore, the porous structure of the APBA@PPy microsphere
makes the electrode surface flexible, facilitating the approach for
electrochemical redox analysis. Thus, the conductive properties of
the PAr-modified electrode are favorable for electrochemical sensing
applications.

APBA@PPy was applied as a diol sensing system
on the basis of two
classical methods, that is, direct sensing and the dye displacement
assay (DDA). In the direct sensing approach, diol-containing compounds,
such as saccharides or catecholamine units, are covalently and permanently
connected to a recognition unit containing the boronic acid moiety.
It is difficult to alter the selectivity of the sensing system given
that the analytes and recognition unit are covalently linked. In dye
displacement assays, sensing is easier due to the noncovalent linkage.44 The development of anion receptors and sensors
based on boron is based on the Lewis acidic nature of trigonal boron.
The rapid binding of boronic acids with diols has been widely exploited
in the context of biosensor development (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Schematic of Binding Equilibria of
APBA@PAr with Diol and OH Ion
As they are related to electrochemical sensing with boronic
acid,
processes employing surface-modified species are more suitable than
solution processes.45 Carbon nanotubes
and graphene-oxide functionalized with APBA provide an excellent platform
for sugar sensing based on specific boronic acid–diol binding.46,47 Herein, it is demonstrated that hyper-cross-linked PPys have good
sensing capability when combined with aminophenylboronic acid because
of their versatile surface modification, with the added benefit of
simplicity of preparation.

Electrochemical characterization
was utilized for direct sensing
of the diol using the boronic acid moiety. d-Glucose and
the neurotransmitter dopamine were chosen as analytes. The PPy and
APBA@PPy-modified GCEs were compared with the bare GCE, as shown in Figure 3d. Curve (i) shows
a significant oxidation peak current at about 0.73 V, which corresponds
to APBA in the APBA@PPy. Curve (ii) shows the CV profile of PPy, where
no redox peak was apparent, and curve (iii) shows the CV profile of
a bare GCE in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.4, acquired
at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. The current peak was
stable even after 20 continuous cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1 (Figure S4 in the SI).

Detection
of Diols by CV
The electrochemical behavior
of the chemosensor was evaluated using CV. The CV response of APBA@PPy
in the presence of diols, including d-glucose and the neurotransmitter
dopamine, at pH 7.4 was evaluated. The peak current of APBA@PPy decreased
with increasing d-glucose concentration (Figure 4a). d-Glucose was
used herein as an archetypal diol-containing compound because of the
course related to diabetes, a chronic, metabolic disease resulting
in abnormal levels of blood glucose. Initially, the modified electrode
was immersed in PBS with addition of glucose to the PBS electrolyte
at millimolar (mM) concentration. Boronic acid bound to glucose, and
the oxidation peak current of APBA@PPy further decreased with increasing
concentration of glucose. The initial peak current of APBA initially
was 5 μA, and it reduced to 3.4 μA with gradual addition
of glucose up to 4 mM. Note that ester formation in the presence of d-glucose may account for the decreased peak current of APBA.
In any case, the CV results indicate that APBA@PPy can be used as
a redox marker for the electrochemical determination of d-glucose in PBS. The high stability of APBA@PPy and its electrochemical
activity in pH 7.4 PBS also allowed its use for detection of the neurotransmitter
dopamine in various concentrations, similar to glucose detection.
After stabilizing the APBA@PPy-modified GCE in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4)
solution, 1 mM of dopamine was added at first to the electrochemical
cell and this was continued up to 4 mM. The electrochemical oxidation
peak disappeared with increasing concentration of dopamine. Figure 4b shows the changes
in the CV curves of APBA@PPy in PBS solution (pH 7.4) before and after
adding different concentrations of dopamine. For comparative study,
APBA@PNp and APBA@PAt were employed as sensing tools for glucose sensing
with various concentrations. The CVs of glucose detection have been
shown in Figure S5 (SI). Even though APBA-modified
PAt and PNp were showing redox peaks, the stability of peaks were
less compared to APBA@PPy because redox stability of pyrene ring influences
the electrochemical properties; moreover, uniform size distribution
of PPy spheres play a major role in the electron transportation. Furthermore,
to find affinity of other diols on this chemosensor, we have tried
sensing with low-affinity diols like sucrose and one strongly interacting
fructose with different concentration ranges (Figure S6 (SI)).

buffer, pH 7.4 with the addition of various concentrations of d-glucose: (i) 0 mM, (ii) 1 mM, (iii) 2 mM, (iv) 3 mM, and (v)
4 mM; (b) CVs of APBA@PPy/GCE with different concentrations of dopamine:

Dye Displacement Assay
of Alizarine Red Using APBA@PPy (ARS–APBA@PPy)
A dye
displacement assay essentially involves an inexpensive colorimetric
binding sensor system, where an analyte displaces a dye from a receptor.
This displacement is marked by a color change that is directly related
to the amount of analyte present. A dye displacement assay system
was developed based on the complex of APBA@PPy and ARS. The ARS–APBA@PPy
system displays a quantitative and qualitative response for glucose
sensing that can be monitored by absorption spectroscopy (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 (Top) Chemical Structure
of the Dye Alizarin Red S and (Bottom) Fluorescence
Response Based on the Displacement of Dye from the Surface of the
APBA@PPy Receptors by Glucose
Previously, Wang and co-workers reported the binding of
ARS to
boronic acid, where the fluorescence emission of the free ARS was
very low and increased notably upon binding.18 As shown in Figure S7A (SI), the fluorescence
intensity of ARS–APBA@PPy was higher than that of free ARS.
The fluorescence quenching of ARS is due to active proton transfer
between the hydroxyl group and the ketone group of the hydroxyanthraquinones.
The fluorescence of ARS increases, and the quenching mechanism is
removed upon the boronic ester formation with APBA in PPy.48 The binding process was also monitored by UV–vis
spectroscopy. Figure S4B shows that the
absorption of the ARS–APBA@PPy complex shifted to shorter wavelength
(from λmax = 520 to 450, i.e., a 70 nm blue shift)
due to binding of APBA@PPy with ARS and there was a significant change
in the absorption peak of APBA in the ARS–APBA@PPy complex.

Sugar
Detection
Binding of ARS to the APBA@PPy receptors
was confirmed, and these binding actions were utilized in a dye displacement
assay to detect the binding of sugars to these receptors. In fact,
in the most common sugars, even direct binding would be spectroscopically
inactive due to the lack of intrinsic chromophores and fluorophores.45 The use of a dye-like ARS in the DDA precludes
that problem and allows the assay using optical spectroscopy, which
is one of the fastest and simplest automated instrumental techniques.

We first optimized the pH of the glucose solution to 7.4 in PBS.
Subsequently, a well-washed and dried ARS–APBA@PPy-treated
glass slide was used as the DDA sensor. The polymer-mounted glass
slide was placed into fresh phosphate buffer solution, and portions
of solid glucose were added. Figure 5 shows the indicator (dye)-containing glass slide before
and after dipping into 1 × 10–3 M of glucose–PBS
solution. Initially, the bromine content of PPy was 4.7 mmol g–1; after treatment with the required amount of APBA,
a suitable amount of bromine was utilized in ARS binding. We assumed
that the APBA content would be similar to the existing Br content,
and this assumption was confirmed by the absorption spectra. No trace
of unreacted APBA was detected. On the basis of this reference point,
0.5 g of APBA@PPy (APBA content = 0.235 mmol g–1) was reacted with a similar amount of ARS. From the dye displacement
assay, very low displacement of ARS by glucose was evident from the
absorption spectra. No absorption peak was apparent when the ARS–APBA@PPy-treated
glass slide was dipped in PBS solution without glucose. This confirms
that ARS was perfectly bound to APBA@PPy. After adding 1 × 10–3 M glucose, some amount of ARS was released from ARS–APBA@PPy
and this positive response caused by the displaced ARS was monitored
by UV–vis spectroscopy.

before dipping (left) and
after dipping (right) into PBS.

Figure 6a
shows
the increase in the intensity of the ARS peak at 520 nm at various
time intervals; after 300 min, the intensity of the peak reached saturation.
The liberated ARS was quantified using an ARS standard curve (correlation
coefficient R2 = 0.9980) obtained with
different concentrations of ARS (Figure S8 (SI)). The concentration of ARS displaced at each time interval
is illustrated in Figure 6b. The maximum concentration of ARS displaced by glucose was
5.1 μmol in 300 min.

Conclusions
In a continued effort
to exploit the potential of hyper-cross-linked
PPy, chemical modification was achieved via a straightforward functionalization
of APBA using unreacted bromomethyl moiety on the periphery of hyper-cross-linked
PPy microspheres. The resultant highly porous microspheres were stable
and insensitive to the solvent, enabling their utility for electrochemical
sensing of d-glucose and the neurotransmitter dopamine. DDA
demonstrated that the system delivered an easily measurable colorimetric
response. These functionalized porous microspheres are promising for
potential applications in sensors.

Experimental Section
Materials
Aromatic monomers, such as anthracene (>99%),
pyrene (98%) and naphthalene (>98%; TCI, Tokyo, Japan), and glucose,
alizarin red S, dopamine, potassium ferricyanide(III), and Nafion
117 solution (∼5% in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols
and water) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further
purifications. Other chemicals such as APBA (97%) and triethyl amine
(TEA, 99%) (from Alfa Aesar, Incheon, South Korea), BME (95%) cross-linker
(TCI), and ZnBr2 (98%) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, South
Korea) were also used as received. Potassium chloride, the PBS containing
disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4) and sodium
dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4), DCE, and dichloromethane
(DCM) were obtained from Daejung Chemical Co. (Korea), and DCE and
DCM were distilled before use.

Instrumentation and Measurements
The functional groups
of the polymer were analyzed by using an FTIR spectroscopy (Nicolet
iS5; Thermo Scientific, Korea) and a PHI 5400 X-ray photoelectron
spectroscope (Mg Kα source; Physical Electronics, Chanhassen,
MN). The surface morphology and surface area of the samples were investigated
using an S-3000H scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan)
and a NOVA 3200e surface area and pore-size analyzer (Quantachrome
Instruments, Boynton Beach, FL). The surface area was determined using
the BET theory. The total pore volumes (Vt), estimated from the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure
(P/P0) of ∼0.997
at 77 K, were measured on the same instrument. The pore-size distribution
was analyzed using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH)
method combined with non-negative regularization and medium smoothing.
TGA was performed using a TGA N-1000 (Scinco, Daejeon, Korea). Fluorescence
measurement was performed on a FluoroMate FS-2 fluorescence spectrometer
(Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The excitation wavelength was set at 365
nm with a recording emission range of 365–800 nm. UV–vis
spectra (200–800 nm) were recorded on a UV-1650PC spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed
by using an Iviumstat electrochemical analyzer (Ivium Technologies,
Netherlands). All electrochemical experiments were carried out using
a conventional three-electrode system, with a platinum foil as the
auxiliary electrode, a silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference
electrode, and the modified glassy carbon electrode as the working
electrode in 0.1 M PBS aqueous solution as the electrolyte.

Synthesis
of Hyper-Cross-Linked Polyaromatics
BME (0.60
g, 4.8 mmol) was added dropwise to the DCE (15 mL) solution containing
ZnBr2 (0.54 g, 2.4 mmol) and pyrene (0.50 g, 2.4 mmol)
under nitrogen atmosphere, and then the mixture was stirred for 30
min at 40 °C. The resulting precipitate was thoroughly washed
with water and methanol until the filtrate became clear. After Soxhlet
extraction with methanol for 24 h, the spherical hyper-cross-linked
PPy was collected (60% yield) and dried overnight in a vacuum oven
at 110 °C. The concentration of unreacted −CH2Br was assayed by colorimetric estimation38 (see the SI for the detailed procedure).
The hyper-cross-linked polynaphthalene and polyanthrecene were synthesized
by a similar procedure.

Preparation of APBA@PPy Microspheres
A 0.1 g portion
of PPy spheres bearing 4.7 mmol g–1 Br on the surface
was dispersed in DCM with APBA (0.47 mmol) in the presence of TEA
at room temperature and kept for 24 h; thereafter, APBA-functionalized
PPy (APBA@PPy) was obtained. The product was thoroughly washed with
water and dried under vacuum.

Immobilization of ARS in
APBA@PPy
Five hundred milligrams
of APBA@PPy (APBA content = 0.235 mmol g–1) was
dispersed in 2 mL of aqueous solution containing ARS (0.235 mmol g–1) and was stirred for 12 h. The ARS-immobilized APBA@PPy
was washed five times with water and centrifuged. The collected sample
was dried under vacuum for 4 h.

Fabrication of the Modified
Electrode and Electrochemical Measurements
A three-electrode
electrochemical cell was employed with Ag/AgCl
as the reference electrode (3 M NaCl). APBA@PPy mounted on glassy
carbon (3 mm diameter) was used as the working electrode and a platinum
wire was used as the counter electrode. Before modification, the electrode
was successively ultrasonicated in ethanol and deionized water for
5 min, respectively. A 10 μL aliquot of APBA@PPy suspension
(a homogenous sonicated solution of 5 mg of APBA@PPy and a mixture
of 5 μL of Nafion, 495 μL of ethanol, and 500 μL
of water) was placed on the electrode surface. The electrode was dried
in air, thereby leaving the material mounted on the GC surface. The
CV measurement was conducted to characterize the fundamental electrochemical
reactions occurring to the electrodes, and K3Fe(CN)6/KCl (5 mM/0.1 M) aqueous solution was employed for the measurement.
The electrochemical performance of APBA@PPy was characterized by CV
in aqueous 0.1 M PBS electrolyte (pH 7.4) with the voltage range of
0–0.9 V using an electrochemical analyzer.

Fabrication
of ARS–APBA@PPy
ARS-immobilized
APBA@PPy was coated on the glass slide and dried for 2 h. The polymer-mounted
glass slide was placed into fresh phosphate and the absorbance was
recorded at 60 min intervals. The observed increase in the absorbance
corresponds to ARS that was competitively displaced from APBA@PPy
by glucose.
