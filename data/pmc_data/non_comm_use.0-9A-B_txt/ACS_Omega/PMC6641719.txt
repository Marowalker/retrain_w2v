Recently, we reported an Ir-catalyzed
formal [4 + 1] cycloaddition
of biphenylenes with alkenes, which gave 9,9-disubstituted fluorenes
in moderate to excellent yields. We proposed a reaction mechanism
that involved the intermolecular insertion of alkenes, β-elimination,
and intramolecular insertion based on the results of experimental
mechanistic studies. Herein, we further support the proposed mechanism
by density functional theory calculations and explain why [4 + 1]
cycloaddition proceeds rather than conventional [4 + 2] cycloaddition.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Biphenylene
contains a strained cyclobutadiene skeleton and is
an antiaromatic compound due to its planar 12-π system. Biphenylene
readily reacts with transition metal complexes to give dibenzometallacyclopentadienes
along with C–C bond cleavage because the bond dissociation
energy of the sp2 C (aryl)–sp2 C (aryl)
bond of biphenylene (65.4 kcal/mol) is much lower than that of biphenyl
(114.4 kcal/mol).1 From a synthetic point
of view, the metallacyclopentadienes can be used as a C4 unit. For
example, biphenylene reacted with a stoichiometric amount of Ni(0)
complex to generate dibenzonickelacyclopentadiene at 0 °C. Subsequent
reaction with diphenylacetylene gave a disubstituted phenanthrene
as a formal [4 + 2] cycloadduct (Scheme 1).2 Although many
examples of the catalytic formal [4 + 2] cycloaddition of biphenylene
with unsaturated motifs such as alkynes and alkenes have been reported,3 there has been only a few examples of formal
[4 + 1] cycloaddition.4 We recently reported
an Ir-catalyzed formal [4 + 1] cycloaddition of biphenylenes with
alkenes (Scheme 2).5 On the basis of the results of experimental mechanistic
studies, we proposed a reaction mechanism that included the intermolecular
insertion of alkenes, β-elimination, and intramolecular insertion
(Scheme 3). Herein,
we explore this reaction mechanism with the use of density functional
theory (DFT) calculations and elucidate why [4 + 1] cycloaddition
proceeds exclusively instead of the usual [4 + 2] cycloaddition.6

2 Results
and Discussion
We performed the DFT calculations for all
of the proposed intermediates,
wherein phenyl groups of the 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthyl
(BINAP) ligand were replaced with methyl groups for simplicity (Figure 1).7Int0 shows a catalytic active species generated
from [Ir(cod)Cl]2 and the diphosphine ligand along with
the liberation of cycloocta-1,5-diene (thermodynamic consideration
of the generation of Int0 is shown in the Supporting Information).8 The first step is the coordination of biphenylene (1) to Int0 to give a η2-coordinated
intermediate Int1, which was judged by the natural bond
orbital (NBO) analysis.9 Oxidative addition
of the iridium center to the C–C bond
of biphenylene gave Int2 via the transition state TS1 (activation energy: ΔG = 19.1 kcal/mol).
This pathway was very exothermic due to the release of the ring strain
in the cyclobutadiene skeleton. Next, the coordination of styrene
(2) to Int2 gave Int3, which
was inserted into the Ir–C bond to afford Int4 via TS2 (activation energy: ΔG = 16.9 kcal/mol). The direction of styrene coordination and insertion
was possibly controlled by steric repulsion between the phenyl group
of styrene and substituent(s) on the phosphine atom. The details of
these results are shown in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 Gibbs free energy profile from oxidative addition to migratory
insertion at 298 K (kcal/mol). Relative energies are in parentheses.

From Int4, β-hydrogen
elimination proceeded
to give iridium hydride intermediate Int5 through TS3 (activation energy: ΔG = 20.6 kcal/mol).
In our previous work, the hydrolyzed product of Int5 was
isolated and fully characterized.5 For
the next intramolecular insertion, the isomerization of the exo olefin
moiety gave Int6, wherein the carbon–carbon double
bond and Ir–C bond could become parallel. The intramolecular
insertion of Int6 afforded Int7 via TS4 along with the formation of a fluorene skeleton (activation
energy: ΔG = 19.5 kcal/mol). After isomerization
of Int7 to Int8, subsequent reductive elimination
through TS5 gave 9,9-disubstituted fluorene 3 and regenerated Int0 (activation energy: ΔG = 22.9 kcal/mol). On the basis of these results, this
reductive elimination was found to be a rate-determining step in the
[4 + 1] cycloaddition reaction (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Gibbs free energy profile from β-hydrogen elimination
step
to product at 298 K (kcal/mol). Relative energies are in parentheses.

We next performed the calculations
for the reductive elimination
of Int4 via TS6, which gives [4 + 2] cycloadduct 4 (Figure 3). The activation energy was 39.6 kcal/mol, which was much greater
than that of the rate-determining step of [4 + 1] cycloaddition (22.9
kcal/mol) (Figure 2).

Figure 3 Gibbs free energy profile of prospected [4 + 2] cycloaddition at
298 K (kcal/mol). Relative energies are in parentheses.

Furthermore, we calculated the transition state
of reductive elimination
to give the exo olefin compound 5 (Figure 4). The exo olefin 5 can be generated
from both Int5 and Int6, but the corresponding
transition states, TS7 and TS8, showed higher
relative energies than any other steps of [4 + 1] cycloaddition. Actually,
when exo olefin 5 was subjected to the reaction, no reaction
proceeded (Scheme 4). Therefore, the transformation of 5 into fluorene 3 via the C–H bond activation did not occur, and this
reductive elimination did not proceed in the reaction of biphenylene
(1) with styrene (2).

to generate exo olefin 5 at 298 K (kcal/mol). Relative
energies are in parentheses.

Scheme 4 Reaction of exo Olefin Compound 5 under Optimal
Conditions
On the basis of these
DFT calculations, we considered the preference
formation of [4 + 1] cycloadduct 3 over [4 + 2] cycloadduct 4 and exo olefin 5. Judging from the slight difference
in the activation energies, there are equilibriums from Int4 to Int8. [4 + 2] Cycloaddition from Int4 via TS6 is entropically unfavored because the biphenyl
moiety loses the flexibility compared with Int4. The
intramolecular coordination of the olefin moiety in Int5 and Int6 slows the reductive elimination for the formation
of the exo olefin 5. The most stable intermediate Int7 gives [4 + 1] the cycloadduct 3. The reductive
elimination for the formation of sp3 C–H bond readily
proceeds.

The formal [4 + 2] cycloadditions of biphenylene with
alkynes have
been widely reported, and phenanthrene derivatives have been obtained.3a−3c,3e,3f To gain an insight into the different reactivities between alkenes
and alkynes, we performed the calculations for the [4 + 2] cycloaddition
of biphenylene (1) with diphenylacetylene (6) (Figure 5). The
alkyne was coordinated to Int2 to form the intermediate Int3, which is similar to Int3 in [4 + 1] cycloaddition
(Figure 1). The alkyne
insertion gave the seven-membered metallacycle Int14 via TS9 (17.3 kcal/mol). Finally, the reductive elimination smoothly
proceeded to give phenanthrene 7 through TS10; the activation energy of this step was 21.4 kcal/mol, which is
much smaller than that of the reductive elimination from Int4 in Figure 3 (39.6
kcal/mol). This difference has already been documented to be due to
the faster reductive elimination for the formation of sp2 C–C bond than that of sp3 C–C bond.10 The activation energy of reductive elimination
is higher than that of oxidative addition (19.1 kcal/mol), which means
that the rate-determining step was the reductive elimination in the
[4 + 2] cycloaddition with alkynes.

Figure 5 Gibbs free energy profile of [4 + 2] cycloaddition
of biphenylene
(1) with diphenylacetylene (5) at 298 K
(kcal/mol). Relative energies are in parentheses.

To ascertain these DFT calculations, we examined the reaction
of
biphenylene (1) with styrene (2) and diphenylacetylene
(6) (Table 1). Although the reaction with alkyne 6 proceeded at
as low as 100 °C to give [4 + 2] cycloadduct 7 in
a moderate yield (entry 1), the reaction with alkene 2 hardly proceeded at 100 °C, and only a trace amount of [4 +
1] cycloadduct 2 was obtained (entry 2). In contrast,
biphenylene (1) was completely consumed at temperatures
higher than 120 °C (entries 3–5). These results supported
the finding that the C–C bond cleavage of biphenylene is not
a rate-determining step in the formal [4 + 1] cycloaddition, and the
activation barrier of [4 + 1] cycloaddition with styrene (2) is higher than that of [4 + 2] cycloaddition with diphenylacetylene
(6).

3 Conclusions
The present DFT calculations supported our previously
reported
reaction mechanism for the iridium-catalyzed formal [4 + 1] cycloaddition
of biphenylene with alkenes: intermolecular insertion, β-hydride
elimination, and intramolecular insertion. Furthermore, we determined
the rate-determining steps in [4 + 1] and [4 + 2] cycloadditions and
explained why the [4 + 1] cycloaddition and reductive elimination
of exo olefin compound exclusively proceeds rather than [4 + 2] cycloaddition
in the reaction of alkenes. In addition, we experimentally and theoretically
disclosed that the reaction of alkene required higher energy rather
than that of alkyne.

4 Computational Methods
All of the calculations were performed at the M0611 level of theory, using the Gaussian 09 package.12 The geometry optimizations was carried out with
a mixed basis set of LanL2DZ13 for Ir atom
and 6-31G(d) for other atoms. Vibration frequency was computed at
the same level of theory to confirm whether the structures are minima
(no imaginary frequencies) or transition states (only one imaginary
frequency). Energies of optimized structures were calculated by the
single-point calculation at the same level of theory with solvation
effects (xylene mixture, ε = 2.387900) using the SMD model.14 The molecular geometries of the transition states
were first estimated by the Reaction plus pro software package (software
to optimize reaction paths along the user’s expected ones,
HPC Systems Inc., http://www.hpc.co.jp/chem/react1.html (written in Japanese)),
based on the nudged elastic band (NEB) method,15 and subsequently reoptimized by the Synchronous Transit-guided
Quasi-Newton method with the keyword QST2 or QST3.16 Transition-state structures were confirmed to connect the
corresponding reactants and products through the use of intrinsic
reaction coordination (IRC) calculations.17

5 Experimental Details
5.1 General
Information
Proton nuclear
magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and carbon nuclear magnetic
resonance (13C NMR) spectra were recorded with ECX-500
(500 MHz) spectrometer. Chemical shift values for protons are reported
in parts per million (δ) relative to the internal standard TMS
(0.0 ppm). 13C NMR spectra were obtained by JEOL ECX-500
(125 MHz) spectrometers and referenced to the internal solvent signals
(central peak is 77.0 ppm in CDCl3). Data are presented
as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (d = doublet, m = multiplet),
coupling constant in Hertz (Hz), and area integration. High-resolution
mass spectra (HRMS) were measured with an electrospray ionization
(ESI)-orbitrap mass spectrometer. Preparative thin-layer chromatography
(PTLC) was performed with silica gel-precoated glass plates (Merck
60 GF254) prepared in our laboratory. All of the reagents were weighed
and handled in air and backfilled under argon at room temperature.
All of the reactions were performed under an argon atmosphere. Unless
otherwise noted, organic compounds and solvents were purchased from
Tokyo Kasei Co., Aldrich Inc., and other commercial suppliers and
were used without further purification.
