To date, a few studies
have investigated the potential use of a
short-pulsed laser in selective tumor cell destruction or its mechanism
of cell killing. Computer simulation of the spatial and temporal profiles
of temperature elevation after pulsed laser irradiation on an infinitesimal
point source estimated that the temperature reached its highest point
at ∼35 ns after a single 15 ns laser pulse. Moreover, temperature
elevation was confined to a radius of sub-micrometer and returned
to baseline within 100 ns. To investigate the effect of 15 ns laser
pulses on A431 tumor cells, we conjugated hollow gold nanospheres
(HAuNSs) to an antibody (C225) directed at the epithelial growth factor
receptor. The resulting nanoparticles, C225-HAuNSs, bound to the cell
membrane, internalized, and distributed throughout the cytoplasm,
with some nanoparticles transported to the vicinity of the nuclear
membrane. On using an optical microscope mounted to a tunable pulsed
Ti:sapphire laser, rapid and extensive damage of live cancer cells
was observed, whereas irradiation of A431 cells pretreated with nontargeted
HAuNSs with a pulsed laser or pretreated with C225-HAuNSs with a continuous-wave
laser-induced minimal cellular damage. Furthermore, after a single
15 ns laser pulse, C225-HAuNS-treated A431 cells cocultured with 3T3
fibroblasts showed signs of selective destruction. Thus, compared
with a continuous-wave laser, shots of a short-pulsed laser were the
most damaging to tumor cells that bound HAuNSs and generated the least
heat to the surrounding environment. This mode of action by a short-pulsed
laser on cancer cells (i.e., confined photothermolysis) may have potential
applications in selective tumor cell destruction.

1 Introduction
Selective
photothermolysis using short laser pulses was first proposed
by Anderson and Parrish in 1983,1 and the
theory of selective thermal damage was extended in 2001 by Altshuler
et al.2 Since then, the use of pulsed lasers
has been successfully translated into the clinic in dermatology and
laser treatment of skin lesions has become a mainstay in the cosmetic
industry.3−5 Intrinsic biological chromophores, such as melanin
and hemoglobin, absorb laser light and generate photothermolysis to
induce pigment bleaching and cell damage. Photothermolysis is controlled
in a spatiotemporal fashion to obtain optimal effect on a targeted
tissue with minimal effect on the surrounding tissue.

Metallic
nanoparticles such as gold nanorods and gold nanoshells
are a new type of optical absorbers that display strong optical absorption
owing to surface plasmon resonance. The peak absorption of these metallic
nanoparticles can be tuned to the near-infrared (NIR) region. It has
been reported that a short-pulsed laser can induce the formation of
nanobubbles around nanoparticles.6−8 Cells with metallic plasmonic
nanoparticles that are irradiated with a pulsed laser are believed
to be destroyed by the expansion and collapse of nanobubbles, and
such a phenomenon is referred to as a photomechanical effect.9,10

However, the mechanism(s) of cell killing and the impact of
photon–nanoparticle
interaction on cancer cells remain to be clarified. The current observations
of nanoscale phenomena on the basis of optical scattering images and
transient acoustic signal recordings are indirect and inconclusive.
For example, the detected acoustic pressure is believed to be a contributing
factor of the nanobubbles generated. However, the formation of nanobubbles
may also result from nanoparticle expansion under the pulsed laser
or vaporization of water with a rapid temperature rise in highly confined
spatial and temporal scales. The recorded scattering image may also
be attributed to nanoparticle expansion and Brownian movement upon
irradiation with a pulsed laser. In addition to laser-induced nanobubbles
and their subsequently generated photomechanical force, photothermal
energy may eventually diffuse from nanoparticles to their adjacent
environment to mediate cellular responses, including cell death. These
considerations prompted us to study the role of photothermolysis in
selective destruction of cancer cells mediated by targeted metallic
nanoparticles and nanosecond (ns) laser pulses.

A simulation
of temporal and spatial temperature variance under
nanosecond laser pulses is critically important to understanding the
effect of short laser pulses on cancer cells. The model is based on
the surface plasmon resonance phenomenon, wherein a fraction of laser
energy is coupled to electrons and forms collective excitation in
metallic nanoparticles.11−13 The plasmon lifetime of metallic
particles (one half of the dephasing time) was reported to be typically
about 10 fs.13−15 The absorbed energy is transported to other electrons
through radiation damping, also called internal thermalization.16−18 Here, electron and electron–hole pairs pick up light energy
and reach internal thermal equilibrium due to electron-to-electron
scattering. The temporal scale of this thermalization process is a
few hundred femtoseconds.16,19 Meanwhile and afterward,
the energy was transferred to a metal lattice by external thermalization.20−22 In this case, the energy of excited electrons is transferred to
the nanoparticle lattice to reach local thermalization, which takes
a few picoseconds through electron-to-phonon coupling.23,24 Thus, the typical interaction times of the surface plasmon resonance,
internal thermalization, and external thermalization were on the scale
of 10, 300, and 3000 fs, respectively. Nanoparticles convert the optical
energy to thermal energy, which eventually is dissipated in the cellular
environment through thermal convection. The rising temperature of
the lattice causes particle expansion and transfers thermal energy
to its surrounding medium. The heat dissipation time for gold nanoparticles
in aqueous solution is related to the particle size; the characteristic
time scale for relaxation varies from 10 ps for the smallest particles
examined (∼4 nm in diameter) to almost 400 ps for nanoparticles
of 50 nm in diameter.25

2 Results and Discussion
The temperature change around a nanoparticle
in a cellular environment
as a function of both position r⃗ spatially
and time t temporally can be obtained by solving
a thermal convection equation. For simplicity, we assume that the
hollow gold nanosphere (HAuNS) nanoparticle is a perfect spherical
point and that heat flux has spherical symmetry, thereby simplifying
a three-dimensional problem into a one-dimensional problem. The energy
distribution of a single-pulsed laser was assumed with a Gaussian
temporal profile. The pulsed volumetric heating of a single pulse
was thus expressed as  where τg is the pulse duration
of the full width at half-maximum. The laser has peak power P0 at time t0. This
equation can be solved once boundary and initial conditions are confined.
Using numerical methods, we obtained temperature elevation as a function
of both position r⃗ and time t. Figure 1 shows the
simulated temperature profiles. An infinitesimal point source absorbs
and transports laser energy to the surrounding medium, causing the
temperature increase. With the use of laser pulses with a 15 ns pulsewidth,
our simulation indicated that most laser energy is converted into
thermal energy. The temperature started to increase 5 ns after the
laser shot and increased in both amplitude and width to peak at 35
ns. Then, the temperature diffused with a decreased amplitude but
an increased width. The spatial range of the photothermal effect was
estimated according to thermal conduction and diffusion equations.
The temperature increase was confined in the characteristic spatial
dimension of 52 nm. Beyond a radius of 100 nm (0.1 μm), there
was no significant temperature increase. Our results support the concept
that the interaction of nanosecond laser pulses with plasmonic metallic
nanoparticles primarily mediates the conversion of optical energy
into temporal and spatial confinement of thermal energy.

of temperature profiles and thermal diffusion profiles
as a function of distance from a point absorber upon irradiation with
a 15 ns laser pulse. An infinitesimal point source absorbs and transports
laser energy to the surrounding medium to cause temperature elevation.
(A) After a single laser pulse, the temperature elevation peaked at
∼35 ns. Afterward, the temperature gradually decreased and
returned to the baseline level over a course of ∼100 ns. (B)
Owing to heat diffusion, the temperature initially increased in both
amplitude and width (solid lines). After the temperature elevation
peaked at 35 ns, the temperature decreased in amplitude but increased
in width. The simulation conditions we used were as follows: heat
capacity of blood (Cp) = 3617 J/(kg K),
blood density (ρ) = 1050 kg/m3, and thermal conductivity
of blood (k) = 0.52 W/(m K). The calculated thermal
diffusivity was 1.369 × 10–7 m2/s,
and the calculated thermal confinement size was 5.23 × 10–8 m or 52 nm in diameter. Beyond the radius of 0.1
μm, there was no significant temperature increase.

In general, pulsed laser energy is simultaneously
converted into
both thermal and mechanical (acoustic) energy by a nanoparticle. The
conversion efficiencies to each energy form are determined by laser
pulsewidth and, perhaps more importantly, the rising and
falling slope of the laser pulse. Ostrovskaya26,27 studied the effects of laser-to-acoustic energy conversion on the
interaction of pulsed laser radiation with a liquid medium and presented
a theoretical treatment for absolute values of the efficiency for
various laser properties (e.g., short pulse and long pulse) with boundary
conditions and nonlinearity. The photomechanical conversion efficiency
was found to be on the scale of 10–7. In the presence
of metallic nanoparticles, previous attempts describing both mechanical
and thermal effects of tissue interaction with nanosecond laser pulses
are likely incorrect because the transfer and conversion of all of
the energy are expected to occur on the spatial scale of nanometers
and on the temporal scale of nanoseconds.

Although a low photomechanical
conversion efficiency is anticipated
in a photon–nanoparticle interaction, metallic nanoparticles
have been widely reported as contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging
(PAI).28−30 PAI is a fast-developing biomedical imaging modality
based on the detection of a photomechanical wave, also referred to
as a photoacoustic wave, induced by the optical absorption of nanosecond
laser pulses.31 Selective uptake of nanoparticles
in cancer cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis enhances the
optical absorption of cancer cells, resulting in strong photoacoustic
signals with high sensitivity and specificity for cancer cell detection.
Nevertheless, according to our simulation, most optical energy of
laser pulses having a pulsewidth in the magnitude of nanoseconds is
transformed into thermal energy by the nanoparticles. Therefore, to
achieve a higher photoacoustic conversion efficiency for PAI in the
presence of metallic nanoparticles, femtosecond laser pulses should
be considered to generate greater photomechanical effects.

To
understand the cellular destruction process after irradiation
with nanosecond laser pulses, we used HAuNS as the NIR light absorber
and conjugated the anti-EGFR antibody (C225) to HAuNS to mediate targeted
binding and cellular internalization of HAuNSs. Transmission electron
micrographs of A431 cells treated with C225-HAuNSs revealed the intracellular
distribution of HAuNSs in the cells (Figure 2). HAuNS nanoparticles were identified as
high-density spherical particles of ∼40–50 nm in diameter
at high magnification (100 000×) and displayed a typical
hollow shell structure with 40–50 nm diameter and ∼7
nm shell thickness. Each A431 cell contained on an average 1600 ±
398 C225-HAuNS nanoparticles. More than half of these nanoparticles
(56 ± 14%) were bound to the cell membrane (Figure 2A,C), whereas the remaining
nanoparticles were distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 2A,B). In the cytoplasm,
C225-HAuNSs often formed clusters of nanoparticles enclosed in intracellular
vesicles forming gold rings with a diameter of ∼0.5 μm
(Figure 2A-iv,B-iv).
Presumably, these C225-HAuNS nanoparticles were internalized through
receptor-mediated endocytosis and localized in endolysosomes. Thus,
C225-HAuNS nanoparticles were effectively taken up by A431 cells.

transmission electron micrographs of A431 cells showing intracellular
distribution of C225-HAuNSs. (A-i) Overview of cellular distribution
of C225-HAuNSs. C225-HAuNSs were found on the cell membrane (A-ii),
in the cytoplasm adjacent to the nucleus (A-iii), and in the cytoplasmic
space enclaved by the nuclear membrane
(A-iv). Red arrows: C225-HAuNS nanoparticles. (B) C225-HAuNSs were
found in the close proximity to the nuclear membrane. Images shown
in B-i–iv were taken at increasing magnification. (C) Quantification
of intracellular distribution of C225-HAuNS in A431 cells. The data
are expressed as mean ± standard deviation calculated from three
cells.

Interestingly, a fraction of nanoparticle
clusters (4.1 ±
0.7%) in these cytoplasmic vehicles was transported to areas in close
proximity (<100 nm) to the nuclear membrane (Figure 2B,C). Further work is needed to clarify the
nature of these vehicles involved in intracellular trafficking of C225-HAuNSs. As shown by our simulation study, nuclear membranes
having the NIR absorber HAuNS localized within the effective photothermal
distance (<100 nm) might be capable of mediating significant biological
effects upon irradiation with 15 ns laser pulses.

Figure 3 shows representative
microphotographs of A431 cells after treatment with C225-HAuNS followed
by irradiation of one and two laser pulses. Before laser irradiation,
the viable cells showed cellular accumulation of C225-HAuNS clusters,
which were greenish under white light illumination due to NIR absorption.
Immediately after the first laser pulse (within 1 s), nanoparticles
turned brownish, indicating melting and collapse of the hollow spherical
structure of HAuNSs. Interestingly, microphotographic images captured
the formation of microbubbles that subsequently collapsed within seconds.
The second laser pulse shot 25 s later also induced the formation
of microbubbles owing to the presence of the remaining intact HAuNSs
in the cells. The nature of these microbubbles is not known. However,
they were most likely water vapor bubbles. Within the time frame of
less than 1 ns, the temperature in a confined space of nanometer radius
could increase rapidly to vaporize water molecules upon interaction
of a laser pulse and nanoparticles under high laser intensity. In
support of this model, others also observed the formation of water
microbubbles. Irradiation of colloidal platinum, for example, was
found to produce water vapor bubbles that condensed back to liquid
on a nanosecond time scale.32

Figure 3 Representative
microphotographs of A431 cells treated with C225-HAuNs
followed by one and two shots of 15 ns 780 nm laser pulses. The second
laser pulse was instituted at 25 s after the first laser pulse. Under
white light illumination, the greenish HAuNS clusters turned brownish.
Microbubbles (red arrows) formed and subsequently collapsed. After
the second laser pulse, additional microbubbles formed. During the
course of first and second laser pulses, blebs were shed off from
the cell membrane. Blue arrowheads: blebs shedding from laser-irradiated
cells.

After only two shots of laser
pulses, A431 cells pretreated with
C225-HAuNS were clearly injured, as evidenced by the blebbing of cell
membrane, rounded morphology, loss of tentacles, and detachment from
microplate surfaces. In contrast, A431 cells without prior treatment
with any HAuNSs that were irradiated with two shots of laser pulses
remained viable under the same conditions (Figure 4A). Unlike C225-HAuNS, A431 cells treated
with nontargeted, poly(ethylene glycol)-coated HAuNSs (PEG-HAuNSs)
did not form clusters of greenish HAuNSs inside cells with the exception
of an occasional nonspecific attachment to the cell membrane (2 of
40 cells in the field of view, or 5%). After the first shot of a laser
pulse, the cells with clusters of PEG-HAuNSs attached to the cell
surface membrane disappeared, accompanied by membrane blebbing (Figure 4B, left panel). However,
for most PEG-HAuNS-treated cells that did not have nonspecific PEG-HAuNS
attachment, no apparent change in cellular morphology was observed
after two shots of laser pulses (Figure 4B, right panel). We conclude that C225-HAuNS
mediates effective cell killing upon irradiation with one or two 15
ns laser pulses.

Figure 4 Representative microphotographs of A431 cells irradiated
without
and with PEG-HAuNS followed by shots of laser pulses. The second laser
pulse was instituted at 25 s after the first laser pulse. (A) Without
prior treatment with PEG-HAuNS, no apparent morphological changes
were noted in cells after two shots of laser pulses. (B) Cells treated
with PEG-HAuNS showed occasional nonspecific attachment of PEG-HAuNS
clusters to the membrane of A431 cells (left panel, red arrow). After
two shots of laser pulses, cells with PEG-HAuNS attached to the cell
surface showed membrane blebbing (blue arrowheads). Most cells did
not show cellular uptake of nanoparticles. No morphological changes
were observed for these PEG-HAuNS-treated cells after two shots of
laser pulses (right panel).

The cellular environment around the nanoparticle possessed
a longer
thermal relaxation time than that of metallic nanoparticles; therefore,
the fast transient temperature elevation reached a point of vaporization
rapidly and the temperature increase was estimated to be confined
to a region in a sub-mircometer scale of organelle structures if the
laser pulse was short enough. The high magnitude of transient temperature
increases in a spatially confined region, even if after only a single
pulse, induced significant cellular damage. We refer to the phenomenon
of cell damage induced by short laser pulses in the presence of NIR
light-absorbing nanoparticles as confined photothermolysis. Parameters
that would influence the thermal diffusion properties after laser
irradiation include laser pulsewidth, laser power density, and optical
properties of the nanoparticles. The rate of confined photothermolysis
in cells is presumably extended from Arrhenius law, which is used
to model cell damage in hyperthermal tumor therapy.33,34 The assumption is that the rate of cell damage is proportional to
exp(−Elaser/RT), where Elaser is the activation laser
energy, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature in kelvin. The threshold temperature
for longer laser pulses was found to vary from 65 °C for 5 s
of heating to 130 °C at a pulsewidth of 300 μs.35,36 At the short pulsewidth of 15 ns, we showed that cell damage could
be induced with a much shorter time of exposure because of confined
photothermolysis.

A431 cells treated with C225-HAuNS were illuminated
by a continuous-wave
(CW) laser beam at a wavelength of 808 nm. The CW laser power density
was 6.37 W/cm2, which was equivalent to an energy density
of 38 J/cm2 (i.e., 6.37 W/cm2 × 6 s). No
morphological changes were observed 55 s after irradiation with the
CW laser (Figure S1). In comparison, the
energy density of a single 15 ns laser pulse was 250 mJ/cm2, which was about 0.66% of the CW beam used. In the time frame of
the CW mode, the absorbed laser energy by HAuNS was converted to thermal
energy and dissipated into the surrounding medium. In the pulsed laser
mode, thermal energy was confined spatially and temporally to generate
a sharp temperature elevation and selective cell destruction. These
results indicate that irradiation with continuous-wave (CW) laser
is ineffective in disrupting C225-HAuNS–treated cells.

To investigate the selectivity of cell damage after shots of pulsed
laser, we cocultured A431 cells and 3T3 fibroblasts and treated these
cells with C225-HAuNS under the same conditions as before. Under the
microscope, these two types of cells had different morphological features.
Fibroblasts were bipolar or multipolar with elongated shapes, whereas
A431 cells were more cycloid and water drop shaped. A431 cells in
the co-culture system also had greenish spots revealing binding and
internalization of HAuNS clusters. No clusters of HAuNS in 3T3 cells
were observed.

To facilitate visualization of membrane integrity,
the cocultured
cells were shot with a single laser pulse in the presence of trypan
blue, a dye widely used as an indicator of membrane disruption. We
observed selective and extensive coloration of A431 cells throughout
the cytoplasm and membrane blebbing after the laser shot over a course
of 55 s (Figure 5A).
In contrast, no membrane blebbing or morphology change was observed
for the fibroblasts within the irradiated field. Unlike that of A431
cells, the cytoplasm of 3T3 fibroblasts had no coloration, although
a light blue color in the cell nuclei could be visualized (Figure 5B). Quantitative
analysis based on 360 A431 tumor cells showed that 97 ± 5% of
these cells were stained by trypan blue dye at 55 s after one shot
of laser pulse. Nearly half of treated A431 cells (46 ± 23%)
had membrane blebbing. Only 3 ± 5% of treated cells did not show
apparent morphological changes and trypan blue staining, possibly,
because of a lack of C225-HAuNS uptake in those cells (Figure 5B). Analysis of 78 cocultured
3T3 fibroblasts showed light trypan blue staining in 94 ± 5%
of these cells at 55 s after one laser pulse shot; none of these cells
had apparent morphological change. About 8 ± 7% 3T3 cells were
not affected by the laser pulse (no coloration or membrane blebbing)
(Figure 5C). Moreover,
the uptake of dye in 3T3 cells was much less and much slower compared
with the uptake in A431 cells (Video S1, Supporting Information). Trypan blue stain, which is based on it being negatively
charged, does not interact with cells unless the membrane is damaged.
Coloration and membrane blebbing of C225-HAuNS-treated A431 cells
suggest that one shot of laser pulse was sufficient to cause irreversible
membrane damage to these cells. The nature of uptake of the dye in
the nuclei of 3T3 cells remains to be characterized. It is possible
that this was caused by nonspecific attachment of a small number of
HAuNS nanoparticles to these cells and subsequent transient membrane
disruption upon laser irradiation.

cells and 3T3 fibroblasts

microphotographs of A431 cells showing extensive trypan blue colorization
and membrane blebbing. (B) Representative microphotographs of NIH/3T3
cells showing moderate trypan blue uptake with no morphological change.
(C) Quantitative analysis of cells with positive trypan blue staining
and membrane blebbing.

The observed high efficiency of the cell killing can be attributed
to several factors. First, internalized C225-HAuNSs (or other NIR
absorbers), which can be attached to the cell membrane or internalized
and transported to be in close contact with vital cell organelles
(e.g., cell nuclei in the case of C225-HAuNS), are capable of inducing
rapid disruption of membrane integrity, leading to exceptionally rapid
cellular damage. Second, according to our theoretical modeling, the
ns-pulsed laser generates a sharp increase in temperature, which is
confined to an area of approximately 0.1 μm in diameter. This
means that treatment with a pulsed laser could be highly selective,
provided that nanoparticles are delivered to the target cells with
high selectivity.

Unlike that with a CW laser beam or other
thermal ablation techniques
such as radiofrequency ablation, it is possible to confine cell damage
with a pulsed laser with a high spatial and temporal control. This
notion is supported by our earlier in vivo studies on mice bearing
4T1 breast tumor, in which we used a beam expander to control the
illumination size to be ∼4 mm in diameter and irradiated tumors
with the 1064 nm pulsed laser at a power density of 4.32 W/cm2 for 30 s. We observed a sharp boundary (∼200 μm)
separating the laser-ablated zone and the nonablated zone, indicating
that treatment with a short nanosecond pulsed laser is feasible and
could produce excellent control in ablation margin.37 Therefore, a pulsed laser might be used as a complement
to surgery, in situations in which tumors are located close to vital
organs (major blood vessels, nerves, etc.). With regard to potential
clinical translation, the Ti-sapphire laser used in our experiments
provides nanosecond laser pulses in the NIR region of 700–960
nm. As such, the NIR light pulses generated from the tunable laser
are 5 times less powerful than their pumping source (i.e., Q-Switched
Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm), which is widely employed in esthetic and
medical applications. We do not anticipate fundamental limitations
for moving this type of laser to the clinics. Using the industrial
safety enclosure design with an optical articular arm, the laser beam
can be safely delivered to the treatment volume in a surgical/interventional
oncology suite.

Our data highlight future research opportunities.
First, the nature
of the blebs shedding from the cells and mechanisms of cell death
need to be further defined. Second, the selectivity of cell killing
is directly related to the selectivity of cell uptake of NIR-absorbing
nanoparticles. The relative contribution of membrane-bound versus
internalized nanoparticles to cell damage remains to be determined.
In addition, future work is needed to further develop innovative nanoparticles
with low nonspecific cellular uptake in nontarget cells and the potential
therapeutic applications of short-pulsed laser in selective ablation
of tumor cells or tumor-associated stromal cells in clinically relevant
animal models of solid tumors. Finally, the laser pulsewidth is an
important consideration when studying the Au nanoparticle–laser
interaction. For example, Schomaker et al.38 described the use of femtosecond laser pulses for enhancing siRNA
transfection with low thermal impact and minimal effect on cell viability.
On the other hand, Ogunyankin et al.39 showed
that for nanobubble generation gold nanoshells prepared from silver
nanoparticle templates could be heated to the melting point of gold–silver
alloy (∼1050 °C) at the laser fluence of 5–20 mJ/cm2 with picosecond laser pulses. Therefore, further theoretical
and experimental studies are needed to clarify the effect of laser
pulsewidth on localized temperature and consequent cellular damage
in the presence of gold nanoparticles.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we report highly efficient cell killing by a single
short laser pulse. This work suggests that confined photothermolysis
mediated by targeted NIR light-absorbing nanoparticles is a promising,
highly selective treatment modality.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
We performed our studies
using hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNSs) that absorb NIR laser light.
Poly(ethylene glycol)-coated HAuNSs (PEG-HAuNSs) were obtained from
Ocean Nanotech (San Diego, CA) and anti-EGFR antibody-coated HAuNSs
(C225-HAuNS) were synthesized according to the reported procedures.40 The peak absorption of HAuNS was 780 nm, and
the hydrodynamic sizes (average diameter) of PEG-HAuNS and C225-HAuNS
were 95 and 173 nm, respectively, as measured by dynamic light scattering.
Trypan blue was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Figure S2 compares extinction spectra of PEG-HAuNS,
C225-HAuNS, trypan blue dye, and culture medium.

4.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy
C225-HAuNS-treated
A431 cells were washed and fixed with a solution
containing 3% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate
buffer, pH 7.3, for 1 h. After fixation, the samples were washed in
0.1 M cacodylate buffer, post-fixed with 1% buffered osmium tetroxide
for 30 min, and stained en bloc with 1% Millipore-filtered uranyl
acetate. The samples were washed several times in water and then dehydrated
in increasing concentrations of ethanol, infiltrated, and embedded
in LX-112 medium. The samples were polymerized in a 60 °C oven
for 2 days. Ultrathin sections were cut in a Leica Ultracut microtome
(Leica, Deerfield, IL), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate
in a Leica EM Stainer, and examined using a JEM 1010 transmission
electron microscope (JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, MA) at an accelerating
voltage of 80 kV. Digital images were obtained using an AMT Imaging
System (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp., Danvers, MA).

4.3 Experimental Setup
The experimental
setup is shown in Figure S3. A wavelength-tunable
pulsed Ti:sapphire laser pumped by a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at a
repetition rate of 10 Hz (Lotis TII; Symphotic) was used for the photothermolysis
experiment. The laser system provides laser pulses with a 15 ns pulsewidth
and wavelength options of 1064 and 532 nm and is continuously tunable
from 700 to 960 nm. A laser wavelength was selected to match the absorption
peak of the nanoparticle applied in each experiment.

The laser
beam was adjusted by a beam expander and then directed onto live tumor
cells seeded in microplates, which were placed under a Leica microscope
(Lecia Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The images were acquired using
a cooled CCD camera (CoolSNAPPro, Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD).
The incident laser energy density of the sample was regulated by controlling
either the laser pulse energy or the beam size. The laser pulse energy
was measured by a pyroelectric energy meter (PE25-C, Ophir, North
Logan, UT). The laser energy fluence on cells was calculated according
to the laser beam incident angle and verified by measurement. The
laser light from a continuous-wave diode laser (15 Plus, Doimed, U.K.)
at a wavelength of 808 nm was also directed onto tumor cells for a
side-by-side comparison with the pulsed laser light at the same wavelength.

4.4 Sample Preparation
A431 epidermoid
carcinoma cells overexpressing EGFR and NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).
To prepare the cell culture for observation using a microscope, microscope
slides (Fisher) were placed into plastic Petri dishes. The cell cultures
were incubated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere
with 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium
in the dish was replaced with fresh medium, followed by the addition
of either PEG-HAuNS (control) or C225-HAuNS to a final concentration
of 2 OD (optical density at 780 nm, ∼0.06 mg Au/mL). After
incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the cells were washed two times
using the same cell medium to remove unbound HAuNSs before laser treatment.
The microscope slides were then taken out of the Petri dish, with
a film of medium solution remaining on the surface. The slides were
then covered with a cover glass (Fisher) before laser irradiation
and microscopic observation. To examine the integrity of the cell
membrane, 20 μL of trypan blue (0.4% in phosphate-buffered saline,
Thermo Fisher Scientifics, Waltham, MA) was added to the Petri dishes
during plating.
