RNA–protein interactions have
a central role in the living
world. In this article, we examined whether primitive peptides (30
residues) consisting of four types of amino acid (Gly, Ala, Asp, and
Val) could interact with tRNA as a model of primitive RNAs in the
RNA world. By in vitro selection of binding peptides using the cDNA
display method, a characteristic peptide was selected from a random
peptide library and assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift and
pull-down assays. Interestingly, the selected peptide bound to a single-stranded
region including a loop structure of an RNA molecule with some sequence
specificity.

Introduction
RNA–protein
interactions are essential biological phenomena
that maintain the viability of living cells.1,2 In
particular, RNA binding proteins play an important role in controlling
all major steps of the lifecycle of mRNA, including translation.3 Thus, one interesting question regarding the
early stages of protein evolution on earth is how could a primitive
protein (peptide) interact with RNA. In the origin of life, the “RNA
world” hypothesis describes RNA molecules as performing self-replication
and preserving genetic information,4 and
a change toward the RNA–protein world (RNP world) occurred
with the emergence of primitive ribosomes.5 So what function did the first protein have? Previous theoretical
examination describing the emergence of the translation system suggested
that if the first protein could interact with RNA and this RNA–protein
complex could enhance the activity of a replicase-ribozyme then the
early translation systems could have evolved by a virus-like strategy
based on Eigen’s hypercycle theory.6 An RNA–protein enzyme has also been suggested to have functioned
in the transition period from the RNA world to the RNP world.7 Thus, determining whether a primitive protein
(peptide) can interact with RNA is of intrinsic importance. Primitive
proteins probably consisted of a smaller subset of amino acids when
compared with the 20 possible amino acids used presently because the
translation system and amino acid synthesis pathways were likely primitive.
A small set of amino acids, such as Gly, Ala, Asp, and Val, could
have been abundantly synthesized by electric discharges under conditions
of the primitive atmosphere on earth and by the impact of comets and
meteorites on the surface of the primitive earth.8 According to Eigen’s theory, the first codons were
GNC (N: A, C, G, and T) that encoded Gly, Ala, Asp, and Val.9 Interestingly, from the viewpoint of the present
protein analysis, Ikehara suggested that primitive proteins also consisted
of those four amino acids.10 Thus, we investigated
whether peptides consisting of these four amino acids could interact
with RNA by in vitro selection from a random peptide library consisting
of Gly (G), Ala (A), Asp (D), and Val (V) using cDNA display.

The cDNA display method is a genotype–phenotype linking
technology for in vitro selection of peptides and proteins using a
cell-free translation system.11−16 The cDNA–protein linkage is very stable in comparison with
that of similar methods (e.g., ribosome display, mRNA display) because
a cDNA molecule is covalently bonded to its coded protein via a puromycin
linker. Furthermore, any unwanted interactions originating from secondary
structures of the mRNA can be prevented because of the formation of
a cDNA/mRNA duplex with reverse transcription using a primer region
in the puromycin linker. In this study, we performed in vitro selection
using cDNA display with a 30-residue random peptide library against
tRNA (a mixture of E. coli tRNAs),
which should represent a model of structured RNA molecules in the
RNA world.

Results and Discussion
In Vitro Selection of Primitive Peptides
Consisting of Four
Types of Amino Acid
The in vitro selection process using
cDNA display with a peptide library composed of four amino acids (G,
A, D, V) from the GNC random DNA library is shown in Scheme 1. The initial DNA library was
constructed with eXact tag (Bio-Rad) and GADV regions. The eXact tag
region was removed after translation and reverse transcription, i.e.,
following the synthesis of the cDNA display library. The resulting
peptide region consisted of only G, A, D, and V. This truncated cDNA
display library was then incubated with tRNA immobilized resin beads.
After washing with selection buffer, the remaining cDNA display molecules
were collected by elution after degradation of the peptide region
with proteinase K. The cDNA moieties of the collected molecules were
amplified by PCR for the next round of in vitro selection. The theoretical
complexity of the pool is around 430 (= 1018). On the other hand, the initial size of the cDNA display library
for in vitro selection was on the order of 1014 sequences.
Our library covered only a part (<1/104) of the whole
sequence space, but this number would be quite high compared to that
of most other in vitro selections. After three rounds of selection,
the library DNA molecules were cloned and sequenced (Table S1). Although 46 clones were sequenced, only six clones
were obtained with a correct sequence that coded the four amino acids
without frame shifts. Many deletions and frame shifts were also found
in the sequences of the eXact tag region. This suggests that errors
were made during the selection process resulting from PCR. PCR of
GC-rich DNA with the normal Taq polymerase used herein
is problematic owing to its poor amplification efficiency and replication
fidelity because stable secondary structures resist melting and promote
nonspecific product formation. Comparatively, the six selected peptides
had many Val residues (Table 1).

Electrophoretic
Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)
Interactions
between the selected peptide GADV1 and tRNA molecules were analyzed
by EMSA (Figure 1)
using a chemically synthesized fluorescently labeled peptide. The
dissociation constant of the peptide and tRNA was estimated by plotting
the ratio of shifted GADV1 peptide bands against the unbound GADV1
peptide band over a range of tRNA concentrations (12.5–200
μM). The results indicate that the GADV1 peptide has a moderate
affinity toward tRNA with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant
(KDapp) of 66 ± 3 μM.
The interaction was also confirmed qualitatively by fluorescence depolarization
experiments (Figure S1). On the other hand,
a control peptide lacking several valines, GADV1–4×Val
peptide, interacts with tRNA with only a very weak affinity. The GADV1
peptide can interact with tRNA at two regions of one tRNA molecule,
or higher tRNA concentrations may result in two tRNAs being bound
for one peptide because two shifted bands were observed on the gel
at 100 and 200 μM tRNA (Figure 1). Additional experiments would be necessary to investigate
the interaction between GADV1 and tRNA in more detail. Next, four
short control peptides, DAVV, VVDV, VGDA, and DAVVVDVG, were
also tested for tRNA interaction. However, the interaction between
the short peptides and tRNA could not be detected clearly (Figure S2). These results indicate that, although
N-terminal Val residues seem to play an important role, the full-length
GADV1 peptide is required for binding to tRNA with a KDapp in the micromolar range.

Figure 1 (a) Fluorescence images
of the gels loaded with GADV1 peptide (upper
panel) and GADV1–4×Val peptide (lower panel) with different
concentrations of tRNA. The loading sample buffer that included bromophenol
blue (BPB) was loaded into the empty lanes to visually confirm alternate
lanes in the gel. The position of BPB is indicated by an arrow in
the figure. Each lane was loaded with the same amount of tRNA. However,
the fluorescence of FAM was quenched at high concentrations of tRNA.
(b) Binding curve plotted to estimate the affinity of GADV1 peptide
for tRNA. The fraction of bound peptide was estimated as follows:
[sum of the intensity of each upshifted GADV1 band at each concentration
of tRNA]/([sum of the intensity of each upshifted GADV1 band at each
concentration of tRNA] + [intensity of the free GADV1 band at each
concentration of RNA]) × 100. The concentration of GADV1 was
lower than that of tRNA; thus,the apparent dissociation constant (KDapp) can be approximated by the
concentration of tRNA that results in one-half of the GADV1 being
mobility-shifted. Curve fitting gave KDapp = 66 ± 3 μM (mean ± standard error; n = 3).

Pull-Down Assay Using Short
RNA Immobilized Beads
The
hydrophobic character of the GADV1 peptide and the absence of positively
charged residues suggest that this peptide could interact with the
accessible bases of RNA. To confirm this conjecture, pull-down assays
were performed using a “Minihelix” RNA (a part of tRNA)17 with a loop region and a UCCA single-stranded
region, a Minihelix-UCCA RNA that lacked the UCCA single-stranded
region from the Minihelix, a Duplex RNA UCCA that lacked the loop
region from the Minihelix, a Duplex RNA that lacked both the loop
region and the UCCA single-stranded region from the Minihelix, and
a single-stranded RNA that had no defined secondary structure (Table 2 and Figure S3). These RNAs were immobilized on magnetic beads,
and a pull-down assay with the GADV1 peptide was performed. All immobilized
RNAs, except the Duplex RNA, were observed to bind the GADV1 peptide
(Figure 2a). Minihelix-UCCA
and Duplex RNA UCCA could also bind the GADV 1 peptide (as could Minihelix).
These results indicate that the GADV1 peptide can interact with the
bases of loop and single-stranded regions of RNA. The GADV1 peptide
obviously binds to the single-stranded RNA most strongly in comparison
with the above Minihelix RNA, Minihelix-UCCA, and Duplex RNA UCCA.
The sequence specificity of GADV1 binding must be weak because there
are no identical exposed base sequence motifs among the Minihelix-UCCA,
Duplex RNA UCCA, and single-stranded RNA. The target molecule in the
in vitro selection experiment was a mixture of E. coli tRNA, and all of the tRNAs have only one exposed identical sequence,
which is CCA at the 3′ terminus. GADV1 may be selected as a
ligand for this universally conserved sequence. When considering that
the loop of Minihelix has a base sequence of UCG, the sequence specificity
might be decreased from CCA to YYR (Y = pyrimidine, R = purine). In
order to confirm this conjecture, several pull-down assays using Duplex
RNA UCCA, Duplex RNA UUCG (with a YYR single-stranded region), Duplex
RNA UACC (with a RYY single-stranded region), and Duplex RNA UUUU
(with a YYY single-stranded region) were performed. The results showed
that the GADV1 peptide could bind to both the UCCA and UUCG RNAs,
but it did not bind to the UACC or UUUU RNAs. (Figure 2b). The results suggest that the GADV1 peptide
can interact with YYR single-stranded regions of RNA.The single-stranded
RNA has three YYR regions, which may explain why the interaction between
the GADV1 peptide and the single-stranded RNA was observed to be the
strongest. As mentioned earlier, in the binding assay of Figure 1, the formation of
a (tRNA)1(GADV1)2 or [(tRNA)1(GADV1)1]2 complex is not likely to take place because
tRNA was in excess over the GADV1 peptide and the concentration of
GADV1 was low. Thus, two up-shifted bands may correspond to (tRNA)2(GADV1)1 or two types of (tRNA)1(GADV1)1 complex, reflecting the presence of multiple putative binding
sites in the tRNA (the loop and UCCA regions). In addition, the binding
site at the loop regions in tRNA may be the anticodon loop because
the bases in the anticodon loop in tRNA are more accessible than the
bases in the T-loop and D-loop.

RNP World and Solubility
of GADV1
Although a primitive
peptide is unlikely to adopt a specific structure, a variety of conceivable
structures containing two antiparallel β-strands and possibly
a single α-helix can be predicted for GADV1 using computer simulations
(Figure S5). In general, present day functional
small proteins (except membrane proteins) are soluble and have stable
conformations; however, the GAVD1 peptide has low water solubility
(<4 μM) because it has many Val residues and probably adopts
a dynamic ensemble of conformations. In the early stage of the RNP
world, it is assumed that the main functional molecules were still
RNAs and that proteins played a role in enhancing the function of
these RNAs. Therefore, the solubility of RNA–peptide complexes
may be more important than that of peptides alone when considering
the functional activity of such primitive peptides. A previous study
showed that proteins (>100 amino acids in length) consisting of
5
or 12 types of amino acid could acquire solubility by in vitro selection.18,19 However, peptides consisting of a smaller set of amino acids like
GADV1 might have obtained solubility by forming RNA–peptide
complexes in the last stage of the RNA world. Alternatively, there
might be very little Val in the RNA world, assuming the conditions
(simulated neutral atmospheres containing N2 and CO2) tested by Cleaves et al.20 A
decrease in the number of Val residues in a peptide should markedly
increase its water solubility. In the future, it would be very interesting
to perform in vitro selection using the GAD peptide library against
tRNA. Recently, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have been
shown to possess many functions, including post-transcriptional gene
regulation, cell signaling, and control of metabolic pathways. In
particular, intrinsically disordered regions of RNA binding proteins
often protect RNA molecules from nucleases and act as RNA chaperones.21−23 Primitive peptides (proteins) like GADV1 may have interacted with
RNA molecules in the early stages of the RNP world in a similar manner
as that observed for IDPs.

In this study, we have shown that
a peptide (selected by cDNA display) consisting of four types of amino
acid (G, A, V, and D) is able to interact with single-stranded regions
of RNA with a KDapp of 66 ±
3 μM. The selected GADV1 peptide can interact with RNAs containing
the single-stranded sequence YYR (Y = pyrimidine, R = purine). Early
peptides (proteins) such as GADV1 could have interacted with RNA molecules
in the early stages of the RNP world in a similar manner as that observed
for IDPs.

Materials and Methods
Peptide Synthesis
The selected GADV1 peptide (GVVVVVVVAAVADVDGDAVVVDVGDVDVVV)
was chemically synthesized by Toray Research Center (Tokyo, Japan).
FAM (fluorescein amidite modification) was introduced at the N-terminus
of GADV1 for the ease of fluorescence detection. The synthesized peptide
with low solubility was examined by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using a fluorescence
image analyzer to confirm of peptide concentration (Figure S6). Reversed-phase HPLC analysis showed that the fraction
of full-length FAM-GADV1 was 3% of the total synthesized peptides
(Figure S7). Other control peptides (DAVV,
VVDV, VGDA, and DAVVVDVG) were chemically synthesized and modified
with FAM (SCRUM Inc., Tokyo, Japan). GADV1–4×Val (GVVVAAVADVDGDAVVVDVGDVDVVV)
was also chemically synthesized and modified with ATTO 488 instead
of FAM (Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan).

DNA Library Construction
For affinity selection against
tRNA, random 30-mer peptides composed of Gly, Ala, Val, and Asp were
designed while facilitating the formation and purification of cDNA-displayed
proteins. The eXact tag was obtained from the Profinity eXact pPAL
Supercoiled expression vector (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) by PCR.
The amplified eXact tag was joined to the 5′ UTR fragment DNA
consisting of a T7 promoter, the tobacco mosaic virus “omega”
UTR, a Kozak sequence, and an ATG start codon by overlap extension
polymerase chain reaction (OE-PCR). DNA encoding the random 30-mer
peptides was composed of the GNC codon triplet, where N indicates
equimolar nucleotide mixtures of A, C, G, and T. The synthesized DNA
coding this random peptide was joined with the above-mentioned UTR-eXact
fragment by overlap PCR, yielding the DNA library for transcription.

Immobilization of tRNA on Agarose Beads
tRNA (total
mixture) from E. coli. (Sigma-Aldrich
Co., Saint Louis, MO, USA, catalog number R1753) was dissolved in
water (30 μM). NaIO4 (0.1 M, 150 μL) was added
to this tRNA (50 μ), and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C
for 10 min to oxidize the 3′ terminus of the tRNA. 3′-Dialdehyde
tRNA was isolated by precipitation with 1.4 mL of 2% LiClO4 in acetone followed by washing with 200 μL of acetone. The
pellet was dissolved in 100 μL of 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2,
and mixed with 100 μL of adipic acid dihydrazide-agarose resin
(Sigma-Aldrich Co.) that was prewashed three times with ultrapure
water (200 μL) using a spin column (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh,
PA, USA). The reaction mixture was shaken at room temperature for
3 h. d,l-Glyceraldehyde (67 mM, 100 μL) was
added, and the mixture was shaken at room temperature for another
1 h. The resulting imine moiety of the tRNA-resin was reduced by adding
250 μL of 1 M NaCNBH3 and incubation at room temperature
for 30 min. The agarose was washed with 500 μL of W1 buffer
(0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 300 mM NaCl, 8 M urea, and 0.1% SDS)
and then suspended in 200 μL of W1 buffer. The immobilization
efficiency was estimated by measuring the amount of recovered tRNA
in the flow-through based on UV absorbance at 260 nm using a NanoDrop
instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The immobilization
amount of tRNA was 2–3 pmol per 10 μL of bead material.

In Vitro Selection against tRNA with a GADV Peptide Library
against tRNA
The DNA library was transcribed into mRNA using
the T7 RiboMAX Express large scale RNA production system (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA), and the synthesized mRNA was purified with an RNA
purification kit (FavorPrep After Tri-18 reagent RNA clean-up kit,
Favorgen, Ping-Tung, Taiwan). Purified mRNA was hybridized to a short
biotin segment puromycin linker (SBP linker)13 under annealing conditions (heating at 90 °C for 1 min followed
by incubation at 70 °C for 1 min and subsequent cooling to 25
°C) in T4 ligase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM ATP) and ligated by T4 RNA
ligase (0.4–2.0 U/pmol mRNA, Takara bio, Otsu, Japan) and polynucleotide
kinase (0.5 U/pmol, Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) at 25 °C overnight.
Translationof the linker-conjugated mRNAs was performed by an in vitro
translation system with a Retic Lysate IVT kit (Retic Lysate IVT kit,
Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) at 30 °C for 30 min. We did not modify
this kit in order to synthesize our peptides composed of four species
of amino acid. To synthesize an mRNA–linker–protein
fusion, KCl and MgCl2 were added to the mixture (final
concentrations of 800 and 80 mM, respectively), and the mixture was
incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. The fusion library was immobilized
on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (SA-beads) (Dynabeads MyOne
streptavidin C1 streptavidin magnetic beads, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) at 25 °C for 30 min. The beads were washed three times
with 1× binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1
M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The immobilized fusions were reverse transcribed
by Super Script III reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) at 40 °C for 30 min. To release the mRNA/cDNA–protein
fusion molecules from the beads, Endonuclease V (Ambion) was added
at 37 °C for 30 min. Supernatant containing cDNA display molecules
was collected. To purify and cleave at the C-terminus of the eXact
tag peptide residue, the eXact tag purification was performed using
a Profinity eXact Mini spin column (Bio-Rad) to remove mRNA/cDNA fusions
and cleave the eXact tag at its C-terminus. In the initial round,
a cDNA display library was prepared from 40 pmol of library mRNA in
200 μL of selection buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 467 mM NaCl,
57 mM MgCl2, 13 mM CaCl2, 9 mM KCl, 0.2% Tween
20). This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min using
a tube rotator (AS ONE, Osaka, Japan) with 100 μL of tRNA-agarose
beads, which was prewashed using the selection buffer. The beads were
washed 10 times using selection buffer. The bound cDNA display molecules
were eluted from the beads with elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 6
M Urea, 2% SDS) at 37 °C for 20 min. The eluted cDNA display
molecules were precipitated with ethanol and the coprecipitant (Quick-precip
Plus, Edge BioSystems, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and were dissolved in
20 μL of water. To prepare library DNAs for the next round of
in vitro selection, T7 promoter reconstructed library DNAs were prepared
from the above precipitated cDNA display molecules by PCR using Ex
Taq HS (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) and primers 5′-GATCCCGCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAAGTATTTTTACAACAATTACCAACAACAACAACAAACAACAACAACATTACATTTTACATTCTACAACTACAAGCCACCATG-3′
and 5′-TTTCCCCGCCGCCCCCCGTCCTATCACCTCCATCTCCCCC-3′
for 25 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 25 s, annealing
at 69 °C for 20 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 30 s. The
amplified product was analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and
visualized afterward via staining with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen). A total
of three rounds of in vitro selection were performed according to
the above protocol with minor changes as follows: the cDNA display
library was prepared from 20 pmol of mRNA in the third round, the
beads were washed 20 times using selection buffer in the second and
third rounds, and the bound cDNA display molecules were eluted from
the beads by proteinase K (500 μg/μL) (Wako, Tokyo, Japan)
in proteinase K reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mM EDTA,
0.5% SDS) at 37 °C for 30 min in the third round. After the third
round, the library DNAs were the cloned using the pGEM-T easy vector
system (Promega) and NEB 5-alpha competent E. coli (high efficiency) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), and 46
DNA clones were sequenced by Operon Biotechnologies (Tokyo, Japan).

EMSA for GADV1–tRNA Interaction Analysis
GADV1
and GADV1–4×Val was dissolved in 2× selection buffer
to 1 μM. The tRNA was dissolved in water (25, 50, 100, 200,
and 400 μM). Then, 1 μL of each peptide solution was mixed
with 1 μL of each tRNA solution, and the mixtures were incubated
at 25 °C for 1 h. Native PAGE sample buffer (0.5× TBE, 30%
glycerol) was added to the mixtures, and the samples were loaded immediately
onto a 4% native PAGE that had undergone pre-electrophoresis at 100
V for 1 h. BPB dye was loaded to confirm alternate lanes. Electrophoresis
was performed at 100 V for 90 min at 4 °C, and the gel was visualized
with a fluorescence image analyzer (Pharos FX, Bio-Rad).

Pull-Down Assay
for GADV1–tRNA Interaction Analysis Using
Short RNA Immobilized Beads
Each RNA based on the sequence
of the minihelix of E. coli tRNAGly (Table 2)17 was chemically synthesized by Hokkaido
System Science Co., Ltd. (Hokkaido, Japan). Minihelix RNA, Minihelix-UCCA,
Minihelix_duplex-B, and mixtures of Minihelix_duplex-B and Minihelix_duplex_UCCA(−)
or Minihelix_duplex(−) were annealed in binding buffer (heating
at 90 °C for 1 min and then cooling to 25 °C). A total of
50 pmol of each RNA sample was immobilized onto 10 μL of SA
beads at 25 °C for 30 min. The mixtures of Minihelix_duplex_UUCG-B,
Minihelix_duplex_UUUU-B, or Minihelix_duplex_UACC-B with Minihelix_duplex_UCCA(−)
were annealed and immobilized in the same way. A total of 1000 pmol
of biotin was then added to each sample to block free streptavidin.
The beads were subsequently washed two times with 1× binding
buffer and 1× selection buffer. The GADV1 peptide in selection
buffer (10 μL, 3 μM concentration based on the intensity
of FAM fluorescence) was incubated with each bead type at 25 °C
for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with 200 μL of selection
buffer, and the remaining peptides were eluted after incubation at
90 °C for 3 min in 20 μL of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4 M urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, 3% (w/v) sucrose, optimal
amount of xylene cyanol). The eluates were subjected to 20% SDS-PAGE
and visualized with a fluorescence image analyzer.
