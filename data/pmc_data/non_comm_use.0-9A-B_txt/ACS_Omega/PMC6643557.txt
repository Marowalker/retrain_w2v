Anthropogenic
sources of xenobiotic metals with no physiological benefit are increasingly
prevalent in the environment. The platinum group metals (Pd, Pt, Rh,
Ru, Os, and Ir) are found in marine and plant species near urban sources,
and are known to bioaccumulate, introducing these metals into the
human food chain. Many of these metals are also being used in innovative
cancer therapy, which leads to a direct source of exposure for humans.
This paper aims to further our understanding of nontraditional metal
metabolism via metallothionein, a protein involved in physiologically
important metal homeostasis. The aggressive reaction of metallothionein
and dirhodium(II) tetraacetate, a common synthetic catalyst known
for its cytotoxicity, was studied in detail in vitro. Optical spectroscopic
and equilibrium and time-dependent mass spectral data were used to
define binding constants for this robust reaction, and molecular dynamics
calculations were conducted to explain the observed results.

Introduction
With the turn of the
millennium, sales of consumer products based on xenobiotic metallic
elements have increased globally. Examples of these metals are Ti,
Ni, and Sn in cosmetics,1−6 Sn, Ni, and rare earth elements in electronic cigarettes,7−9 Cd in batteries, Hg in lamps, As in older microchips, and platinum
group metals (PGMs; Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Os, and Ir) in jewelry and widely
in the automotive industry.10−13 In addition, occupational exposure and environmental
pollution can occur as a direct result of metal mining and refining.14,15 These metals have no known physiological role, and with multiple
routes of exposure, pose an unknown and largely unavoidable risk to
human health. In the case of metallotherapeutics incorporating a range
of rare metals (e.g. Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Rh, and others), humans are directly
exposed to acute concentrations. This increase in mobilization of
these rare metals results in widespread human exposure, spreading
from concentrated points and diffusing across the globe.

The
physiological response to these rare metals relies on the body’s
own protective response mechanisms to metals. Because of their nucleophilicity
and metal scavenging ability, biological thiols such as metallothioneins
(MTs) and glutathione (GSH) are involved in toxic metal resistance,
whether directly or due to a downstream response triggered by metal
exposure. Reports of these PGMs in urban environments and prevalence
and accumulation in marine life near industrial runoff indicate the
impending omnipresence and perturbance in the food chain and in daily
life.16,17 The release of these metals into the atmosphere
is traceable in arctic ice cores, indicating the widespread dispersion.18−20 This is also reflected in the increased expression of MTs and the
documented accumulation of PGMs initiated in a wide variety of marine,
shellfish, seaweed, and plant MTs, to changes in the mineral environment.
This metal accumulation in organisms can be used as a natural marker
for environmental toxicity.21−25 Regardless, while the introduction of such foreign metals triggers
an apparent defensive response, renal toxicity can still occur (e.g.
Cd in MT, itai–itai disease). The long-term storage of Cd by
MT in the kidneys raises the question about whether these xenobiotic
metals will follow this pathway and bioaccumulate. For instance, platinum
levels persist many years after anticancer treatment in the blood
of urban women.26

While the forms
of these metal pollutants are generally metallic and considered stable,
it is important to remember that these metals are not normally found
on the surface of the earth and that their introduction into the ecosystem
through mining (runoff), processing, and subsequent consumer product
disposal will ultimately cause physiological changes in affected life
forms. Without previous knowledge or history with this type of pollutant,
it is important to understand the possible response of biological
metalloproteins, such as MTs, with metals that humans and the natural
world have not traditionally but are now becoming increasingly exposed
to.

Metallothioneins
MTs are ubiquitous metal chelators found
throughout nature. The primary sequence of this family of small proteins
(∼6 kDa) consists of 30% cysteine residues, making these proteins
extremely air-sensitive, considering natively, no disulfide S–S
bonds are present. The mammalian βαMT 1A isoform is a
two domain protein (N-terminal β domain, 9 cys; C-terminal α
domain, 11 cys), whose 20 cysteine thiolates participate in metal
binding, transport, and recycling of physiological metals (Zn(II),
Cu(I)), controlling cellular metal sinks and donating cofactor metals
to metalloproteins as required.27,28 MTs also sequester
toxic soft metals, such as Cd in the first MT isolated (equine).29 A build-up of these toxic metals can result
in renal failure and death.29,30 The regulation of the
MT gene is controlled by cellular concentrations of free metals.27 This characteristic and its down-stream effects
have been implicated as a mode of resistance by MT in cancerous cells
in response to anticancer metallotherapeutic agents.

Except
for a few examples,31−34 mechanistic details of reactions of xenobiotic metal complexes with
MTs are largely unknown. Mammalian MTs are intrinsically disordered
when metal-free, but the titration of M(II) to saturation produces
two metal-thiolate clusters, one in each domain, with the 20 cysteines
involved in a network of bridged and terminally bound sulfurs. These
metals can be displaced by softer metals with a higher binding affinity.
The order of increasing binding constants of metals with free thiols
is as follows: Zn(II) < Cd(II) < Pt(II) < Bi(III) < As(III)
< Cu(I) ≈ Hg(II).30 Hg(II), and
Cd(II), for example, can displace the Zn(II) in native Zn-MT, releasing
free Zn(II) into the cytoplasm.35 The Cd(II),
Zn(II), and Cu(I) forms of MT are the most understood as they are
most commonly found in nature. Metalation with other toxic or heavy
metals results due to exposure, whether through pollution or drug
administration—rare occurrences of metal exposure that are
not understood until they are observed in effect. It is becoming clear
through studies of metalation, where M ≠ Cd(II) or Zn(II),
alternate mechanisms are in play, notably with the nonclustering As(III)
binding,36,37 or complex deconstruction of cisplatin.33 While metalation of MTs with metal ions is well
understood in vitro, the interaction of these proteins with nontraditional
metals and metal complexes-carrying ligands are not fully understood.

Exposure
to Xenobiotic Metal Complexes from Therapeutic Agents
Since
the discovery of platinum based anti-cancer drugs, developed chemoresistance
in certain cancer types has been associated with increased expression
of MT.38−41 MTs can interfere with a chemotherapeutic agent before it can reach
its desired target or act in converse to its desired cytotoxic effect.
Cellular thiols such as GSH and MT are correlated with induction and
expression in resistant cancers, although their direct causation to
resistance is unclear. MT expression levels are affected by a variety
of stress inducers21,39,41−51 including metal therapeutics, for example Au and Ag nanoparticles52−54 and Pd, Pt, and Rh particles airborne through mining and industrial
exposure.15 Cisplatin resistance and its
relationship with MT’s aggressive metal binding behavior is
the focus of much research.31,33,55−60 MTs are rich in highly reactive cysteine thiolates, which are suspected
of being involved in the interference of platinum drugs. The many
stress inducers of MT may easily cause upregulation of the protein
following a dosage of platinum drugs. This trend has been identified
by looking at MT mRNA expression and cellular MT levels in a variety
of cisplatin resistant cell lines compared to their parent lines.38,52,59,60 In medicine, new metallocomplexes show promising results in clinical
trials, many of them consisting of PGMs and related metals.61 This present study focuses on this new realm
of “nontraditional metalation” to draw attention to
the mechanism behind the metalation of xenobiotic metals to mammalian
MTs.

In this study, we turn to the specific exposure of humans
to a xenobiotic metal complex, where the clearest examples come from
well-defined cytotoxic agents. The antitumor agent and common chemical
catalyst dirhodium(II) tetraacetate (Rh2(OAc)4) and its binding reactions to MT is the focus of the study described
here.

Cytotoxic Dirhodium(II) Tetraacetate as a Model Metal Complex
The American Food and Drug Administration’s approval of
cisplatin in 1978 opened exploration of the cytotoxicity of metal-based
complexes for cancer treatment.62−64 Dirhodium(II) carboxylate complexes
[Rh2(O2CR)4 (R = Me, Et, Pr)] are
18 electron systems when coordinated by solvent, involving octahedral
coordination of each of the rhodium metals. Dirhodium(II) carboxylates
are mildly water soluble and display high in vivo antitumor activity
against multiple tumor lines.65−68 Similar to cisplatin, these dimeric compounds also
cause disruption of DNA replication and transcription, as well as
creating DNA adducts and cross-linking.69−73 Most notably, these antitumor dirhodium complexes
irreversibly bind free cysteinyl thiols, inhibiting thiol-dependent
enzymes.66,68,74 Unlike other
amino acids, the reaction of cysteines with these rhodium complexes
results in a breakdown of the carboxylate cage structure by thiolate
replacement of the O donor ligands.67,73 Their sensitivity
to sulfur coordination from cysteines in biomolecular targets means
rhodium(II) carboxylates can also act as radiosensitizers by depleting
cellular thiol sources, lowering the cell’s ability to respond
to oxidative stress.74,75 Current research has extended
the applications of rhodium compounds to medical imaging, radioactive
isotope therapy, photodynamic therapy, and protein labeling, but the
significant antitumor characteristics of these rhodium complexes remain
of great interest.65,74,75

Dirhodium(II) tetraacetate (Rh2(OAc)4), Figure 1, is the
simplest of the dirhodium(II) carboxylates. Rh2(OAc)4 is used widely as a synthetic catalyst in many organic reactions,
a unique form of potential occupational exposure. It is used to catalyze
C–H, X–H insertion and aromatic cycloaddition and has
a relatively high solubility in aqueous solutions compared to Cu(II)
acetate. Rh2(OAc)4 and related dirhodium complexes
have demonstrated significant antitumor activity; Rh2(OAc)4 administered to mice dramatically decreased the size of tumors.65−68 Tumor growth was inhibited by the interruption of DNA replication
and protein transcription. Exhaled 14CO2 from 14C-labeled Rh2(OAc)4 indicated that
the complex was decomposed within the organism. Urine analysis showed
that ∼1% of the Rh was excreted, indicating that the remaining
rhodium irreversibly bound to its target and accumulated. However,
the exact target of Rh2(OAc)4 activity is unknown,
and toxic renal side effects were high.65−68

Figure 1 Ball-and-stick representation of (Rh2(OAc)4). Teal represents Rh, red represents O,
gray represents C, and white represents H.

Because these dirhodium(II) carboxylates are uniquely sensitive
to cysteine binding, MT is a likely binding target. Another major
cellular thiol, GSH, was found to rapidly form adducts with Rh2(OAc)4 both aerobically and anaearobically.76,77 If cytotoxicity by Rh2(OAc)4 involves DNA
adduct formation or inhibition of specific enzymes, then MT would
be acting as a pretarget interference source. Alternatively, if the
cytotoxicity involves the depletion of cellular thiols, then MT would
be the desired target. This can provide beneficial information for
the design of future chemotherapeutics.

Scope and Application of
Results
To prepare for the inevitable increased exposure
of humans to xenobiotic metal complexes from many sources, it is imperative
to understand their physiological chemistry. For the success of metal-based
chemotherapeutics, it is imperative to understand drug metabolism
and resistance mechanisms. The strong correlation between cellular
thiol induction and chemoresistance requires the study of the metal
binding pathways to the key thiol molecules, especially ubiquitous
MTs. In this paper, the systematic and rapid deconstruction of the
tetraacetate ligands in Rh2(OAc)4, and the robust
Rh2 binding by the 20 cysteines in apo-βαMT
is reported. The metalation speciation was modeled using semiquantitative
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) data to obtain
relative Kf values. Time-dependent ESI-mass
spectral data show the sequential loss of the Rh2 core
ligands. The results and their impact on our understanding the cytotoxic
and environmental effects of the bioconjugation of MT and dirhodium
complexes are discussed. In the text, “MT” refers to
the 20 cysteine mammalian MTs, unless otherwise specified. “βαMT”
refers to the human isoform MT1a as described in the Methods.

Results and Discussion
Metalation Reactions of
βαMT with Rh2(OAc)4: Optical Spectroscopic
Properties
Figure 2, top, shows the UV–visible absorption spectral data
for the titration of apo-βαMT with increasing mole equivalents
of Rh2(OAc)4 added. Significantly, the UV–visible
absorption data show an increased absorption at ∼300 nm, corresponding
to the well-known cysteine S → Rh ligand-to-metal-charge-transfer
(LMCT) band. Similar absorption is also observed with GSH, cysteine,
methionine, and other biological thiols76−82 and confirms the cysteine thiol as the binding moiety involved in
the Rh2 complexation. This LMCT band is very strong and
the transition from the blue of the metal solution to the yellow of
the protein-bound product can be followed readily with the naked eye.

Figure 2 UV–visible
absorption (top) and CD (bottom) spectra for a titration of 25 μM
βαMT with the black arrow showing the direction of increasing
molar equivalents of Rh2(OAc)4. The S →
Rh LMCT band increases in absorbance at ca. 300 nm.

When compared to previous results involving Rh2(OAc)4 and the 9 cysteine apo-βMT,78 the weak absorption caused by the Rh–Rh
bond ∼580 nm is not apparent with the full, 20 cysteine apo-βαMT.
This is likely due to the broad 20 cys S–Rh absorbance overlapping
the weak Rh–Rh absorption. While previous knowledge leads us
to presume that the Rh–Rh bond remains intact, we must rely
on other data to confirm this.

In the case of the circular dichroism
(CD) spectral data (Figure 2, bottom), it is surprising that no significant spectral intensities
are observed during the titration of the full apo-βαMT.
However, the lack of a distinct CD spectral intensity is likely due
to the overlap from the presence of several structurally different
species because the mass spectral and structural cysteine modification
data indicate that the Rh2(OAc)4 has bound to
the apo-βαMT. This contrasts the results previously reported
for Rh2(OAc)4 binding to the 9 cysteine β-domain
fragment, in which a single product is formed in a 1:1 fashion, as
confirmed by ESI-MS, producing a strong CD signal.78

Early Reaction Steps and Initial Deconstruction
of Rh2(OAc)4 by Apo-βαMT: Rapid
Displacement of the Tetraacetate Ligands
 1  Figure 3 shows a series of ESI-mass spectra as a
function of increasing molar ratio of Rh2(OAc)4/MT (from 0 to 1 mol equiv). The data shown in Figure 3 provide a snapshot of speciation at very
low molar ratios during the early stages of apo-βαMT (6875
Da) metalation, described by the reaction in 1. As previously demonstrated with cisplatin,33 the apo-βαMT rapidly (within the dead time of the instrument)
engulfs the incoming Rh2(OAc)4 molecule (441.99
Da) and then systematically shreds the ligands from the metal complex
until only the Rh–Rh core is sequestered within its thiolate
binding site. The mass spectral data show the presence of the incoming
complete complex and the final isolated Rh2 core bound
to the MT. The protein species with masses of 7316, 7517, and 7758
Da are representative of Rh2(OAc)4-MT, Rh2(Rh2(OAc)4)1-MT, and (Rh2(OAc)4)2-MT, respectively. These dominant
masses gradually diminish as the acetate ligands are displaced, until
the masses of the final products of Rh2MT and Rh4MT, at 7074 and 7273 Da, respectively, dominate. The change in mass
coincides with the mass differences between the lost acetate moieties
from the Rh2(OAc)4 bound protein species, where
each acetate group has a mass of 59.04 Da.

Figure 3 Initial deconstruction
of Rh2(OAc)4 by apo-βαMT observed
with ESI-MS. Stepwise addition of 0.0–1.0 mol equiv of Rh2(OAc)4 to 20 μM apo-βαMT. Major
species are indicated by dashed lines: black for apo-βαMT,
red for Rh2MT, blue for Rh4MT, and green for
species bound to at least one complete Rh2(OAc)4 molecule. Carboxymethylated MT species are mass-shifted by ∼60
Da and are represented with a triangle.

Spectroscopically, the Rh–Rh bond can be determined
by a very weak absorbance at ∼580 nm in solution. However,
this band is overlaid by the strong S to Rh LMCT, when the Rh2(OAc)4 binds both initially and finally to the
thiols in MT. Previous studies with thiol complexation (e.g., GSH,
methionine, and so on) indicate that the thiols coordinate to the
axial positions and do not disrupt the Rh–Rh bond.77,81,82 Because of the properties of
MT metalation, we can infer that this bond has not been broken. If
the metals were separated into mononuclear metal centers, it would
be expected that the metal exchange reactions between MT molecules
observed with Cd, Hg, Cu, and so forth would also be observed with
Rh. This would result in a distribution of metals, including stoichiometric
ratios with odd numbers. However, only pairs of Rh (i.e., Rh2) are ever observed in mass differences between species, indicating
that the Rh–Rh remains locked in a bimetallic state. It remains
unclear how the Cys thiols coordinate the Rh, whether terminal cysteines
are involved, or bridging S coordination as suggested by Dunbar et
al.83

Experimental and Simulated
Formation of Rh2MT, Rh4MT, and Rh6MT
The formation of Rh2-metalated βαMT
products can be described by three stepwise bimolecular reactions,
as shown in Scheme 1. Each metalation event begins with encapsulation of the whole molecule,
followed by rapid deconstruction of the ligand structure to the dirhodium
core. The metalation continues with the formation of the ligand-stripped
Rh4MT (7273 Da) and Rh6MT (7473 Da). Figure 4 shows that a series
of stepwise metalation reactions as from 0.0 to 2.0 mol equiv of Rh2(OAc)4 were added to apo-βαMT under
equilibrium-binding conditions. The major product of the reaction
is Rh4MT, which forms rapidly, with a small amount of Rh6MT.

Figure 4 ESI-mass spectral data recorded during the titration of 20 μM
apo-βαMT with aliquots 0.0–2.0 mol equiv Rh2(OAc)4. The major species are indicated by dashed
lines: black for apo-βαMT; red for Rh2MT; blue
for Rh4MT; and green for Rh6MT. The inset bar
graphs on the right of each spectra show simulated mass spectral data
based on the model described in figure, using Kf values in Table 1. Carboxymethylated βαMT species are mass-shifted
by ∼60 Da, are represented with a triangle, and are not included
in the simulation.

Scheme 1 Proposed Bimolecular,
Stepwise Metalation Reactions for Rh2(OAc)4 Binding
to Apo-βαMT
K1–3 represent the stepwise equilibrium binding constants
for each reaction.

The further addition of
3.0 and 4.0 mol equiv of Rh2(OAc)4 did not result
in any further significant changes to the mass spectra (see Supporting Information for data). This is unexpected
as MT is known to be fluxional enough to adopt a high M(I) and M(II)
to MT stoichiometry. Because metalation does not continue, it is clear
that the structure has reached a maximum capacity. The intensity of
each metalated state is related to their equilibrium rate constants,
when described as bimolecular reactions, as shown in Scheme 1. These Ks will allow us to understand the distribution we see, with
only a small fraction of highly metalated MT species.

Using
the Hyperquad simulation speciation84 software,
the mass spectral abundances associated with these reactions were
modeled based on the concentrations and mole equivalences of the Rh2(OAc)4 added, using the equations in Scheme 1. The three relative stepwise K values (shown in Table 1) were calculated so that the
simulated model matched the experimental data, Figure 4. The calculated abundances were used to
simulate the mass spectra as seen in the red bar graph Figure 4 insets. The simulated mass
spectra closely match the experimental MS data over the course of
the titration.

Figure 5 shows the experimental speciation data extracted
from Figure 4. The
sequence of speciation clearly follows a typical noncooperative metalation
mechanism85 in which Rh2MT forms,
followed by Rh4MT and by Rh6MT. The fitted results,
the smooth lines in Figure 5, match the experimental data closely and provide the relative
binding constants as shown in Table 1.

Figure 6 shows the absorbance data of the S →
Rh LMCT band at 300 nm plotted against the addition of metal. The
rise in absorbance is correlated with the appearance of metalated
species (RhMT) in the experimental mass spectrum, Figure 4, indicating that the mass
spectrum reflects the solution phase species.

Figure 6 Absorbance data of a
titration from 0 to 2.0 mol equiv Rh2(OAc)4 overlapped

from 0 to 2.0 mol equiv Rh2(OAc)4. The % absorbance
(blue triangles) shows the increase at 300 nm from the absorbance
data in Figure 2 aligning
with the % metalated species formed (black squares). The % speciation
for apo-βαMT is shown with red circles.

Nontraditional Metalation and Metal Complex
Deconstruction Is Evident from the Mass Spectra
Mass spectrometry
is especially helpful in identifying biological targets.86 ESI-MS is a soft ionizing, high-resolution,
solution-phase technique that is ideally suited for tracking the metalation
status of MT. The advantage of using ESI-MS is that it allows for
confirmation of the presence of intermediate states in real time.
These versatile properties have been widely exploited in native ESI-MS,87 allowing detailed kinetic and equilibrium studies
of the metalation of MTs.78,85,87−98 Binding coefficients can be accurately extracted from these data.
The observed kinetic binding of Pt(II)1–7 from cisplatin
was first determined by chromatographic methods,99 which were then enhanced by our ESI-MS modeling methods,33 a similar methodology to that applied to this
current dirhodium study. The stoichiometric and structural information
provided by the ESI method is particularly important for MT because
the lack of typical protein features and its high sensitivity to oxidation
makes MT’s protein structure difficult to observe with crystallography,
NMR, or other structure elucidating methods.

The conditions
for cooperative and noncooperative bimolecular metalation of Zn(II),
Cd(II), and Cu(I) to MT have been studied with consistent stoichiometric
ratios identified primarily using ESI-MS, including traditional metalation
to form stable cluster states M(I)6S9, M(II)3S9, and M(II)4S11.37,85,88,89,91−93,100

The presence of metal-thiolate (Zn(II), Cd(II), Cu(I)) clusters
that form in higher ratios of these metals make MTs resistant to trypsin
digestion.94 However, it should be noted
that As(III) binding is not considered to involve cluster formation.
The As(III) bound to the isolated MT fragments M(III)3S9 in the β domain fragment and also M(III)3S9 in the α domain fragment and to the full protein
forms M(III)6S18,37 which means that the MT peptide flexibly accommodates a completely
different style of binding than reported for the group 12 M(II) ions.
Our results show that Rh2 binding also does not follow
traditional cluster formation of Zn(II), Cd(II), and Cu(I), as it
binds to MT in a rigid manner. MT is unable to perform its usual metal
relocation, as described in Chart 1. Therefore, a novel MT binding mode is now reported
for Rh2 in this study, which enforces the difference between
the metalation of complexes and metal ions by MTs.

Chart 1 Proposed Pathway
for Metalation of βαMT 1a by Rh2(OAc)4 at Physiological pHa
a The two pathways shown
apply to different configurations. Pathway A: Rh2MT binds
an additional Rh2(OAc)4 which is deconstructed,
forming Rh4MT of configuration I. No further metalation
occurs at this point. Pathway B: Rh2MT binds an additional
Rh2(OAc)4 which is deconstructed, forming Rh4MT involving a proposed alternate configuration II. This form
can proceed to bind a further Rh2(OAc)4, producing
Rh6MT.



The metalation of Rh2(OAc)4 to apo-βαMT can be categorized
as nontraditional metalation, because the binding of MT involves chelating
Rh2(OAc)4 followed by disassembly of the initial
metal complex by displacement of the original coordinated ligands.
ESI-MS has been used to observe this destructive effect MT has with
cisplatin and Ru-based arene complexes.31 This step-wise, sequential deconstruction of Rh2(OAc)4 has been reported previously with the 9 cysteine single apo-β-domain
fragment of MT1a. Under those conditions, one discernible product
(Rh2MT) is formed in a linear fashion.78 In this present ESI-MS study, the full, two-domain protein
has a higher sulfur availability (20 cysteines), which greatly increases
the rate of reaction and the number of possible conformers (Rh2MT, Rh4MT, and Rh6MT) that can form.
The ligand loss of the coordinating acetates and accumulation of the
sequestered metal species show that Rh2(OAc)4 does not survive intact when bound to MT. This emphasizes the destructive
effect MTs can have on both chemotherapeutically related complexes
and xenobiotic metals in inorganic and bioinorganic forms.

pH-Dependent,
Metal-Dependent Metalation Mechanism of MTs
Figure 7 shows the time-dependent metalation
of the 11 cysteine single domain apo-αMT fragment at pH <
2 with Rh2(OAc)4. This pH is extremely low;
Cd(II) cannot bind to MT due to proton competition under these conditions.
However, the results how, despite the extreme condition, the S–Rh
bond formation forms favorably. Over the time course of the reaction
(44 min), species ranging from [Rh2(OAc)4]1-MT to [Rh2(OAc)4]6-MT are
observed. This is completely different when compared with the results
from the titration carried out at pH 7.4 with the two-domain protein
(Figure 4), which resulted
in rapid metalation and systematic ligand loss.

Figure 7 (Left) Time-dependent
mass spectral data of apo-αMT at low pH (<2), recorded over
44 min following addition excess Rh2(OAc)4.
Data acquisition times are (averaging times shown) at 0 min; 17−19;
23−25; 33−34; 34−35; and 42−44 min. Red
arrows indicate mass shift resulting from the loss of (OAc)4. (Right) Labels for identifiable species in the mass spectral data
and proposed formation pathways.

In Figure 7, the key species identified are apo-αMT, [Rh2(OAc)4]1-αMT, [Rh2(OAc)4]2-αMT, [Rh2(OAc)4]3-αMT,
[Rh2(OAc)4]4-αMT, [Rh2(OAc)4]5-αMT, [Rh2(OAc)4]6-αMT, Rh2[Rh2(OAc)4]1-αMT, Rh2[Rh2(OAc)4]2-αMT, Rh2[Rh2(OAc)4]3-αMT, Rh2[Rh2(OAc)4]4-αMT, Rh2[Rh2(OAc)4]5-αMT, Rh2-αMT, and Rh4-αMT.

These data show that the unfolded, loose
structure caused by the high [H+] greatly increases cysteine
accessibility to the incoming Rh2(OAc)4 in this
single domain fragment. In the presence of excess Rh2(OAc)4, this manifests as two distinct reaction pathways: (i) ligand
replacement by thiolates following Rh2(OAc)4 binding, as described for the whole protein above, and (ii) proposed
axial coordination of Rh2(OAc)4 by cysteine.
These two reaction pathways are outlined in Figure 7, right. The acidic conditions minimize the
nucleophilicity of the cysteinyl thiols and allow for the lower Cys/metal
ratios to bind with metal ratios of up to 6× Rh2(OAc)4 per MT molecule. Despite the observation of this “supermetalation,”
the cysteine replacement of the tetraacetates still occurs albeit
significantly slower than at physiological pH.

The low pH experiment
shows that while the unfolded, 11 cysteine apo-αMT can bind
to the Rh2(OAc)4, it is unable to effectively
displace the coordinating ligands of the complex. Instead, the unfolded
peptide quickly binds to 1–6 Rh2(OAc)4 species which occupy and lock the cysteine thiolates from further
reactivity. Significantly, the MS data recorded at pH < 2 demonstrate
that Rh2(OAc)4 has a strong binding affinity,
surpassing that of Cd, which is completely demetalated from MT at
this pH. These acid-denatured conditions impede MT from attaining
efficient metal complex metabolism. This contrasts the results at
physiological pH, at which the more folded MT structure can orient
its cysteines to displace the coordinated ligands more effectively
than the unfolded protein. The key message from the data reported
here is that the initial intrinsically disordered MT structure at
physiological pH can flexibly entrap metal complexes and is necessary
to further react, deconstruct, and isolate the metal for storage.
We describe these properties as nontraditional binding of MTs, and
we expand on this subject below.

Cysteine Modification by p-Benzoquinone and N-Ethyl Maleimide Titration:
Structural Information Regarding Solvent Accessibility
The
2° and 3° structures of human MT are only defined by metalation,101 as it exhibits no 2° structural elements
or aromatic residues. A broad distribution of metalated and metal-free
MT species exists in the cell.88,89,92,93,102−104 Despite the sensitivity of the free cysteines
to oxidation, fluorescence labeling has demonstrated the presence
of metal free apo-MT in vivo in roughly equal quantities to holo-ZnMT,
both in the oxidized and reduced form.105 This confirms that metalation of MT is a posttranslational modification
that can only occur once the protein is fully synthesized because
of the cross-linking nature of metal–cysteine coordination
that forms the metal-thiolate clusters. To better understand the metalation
reaction, we use the fully demetalated apo-βαMT as the
model for the partially metalated MTs expected in vivo.

Typically,
protein structural information can be obtained by analyzing the charge
state distribution patterns in the mass spectral data. Because of
the small size of MTs, this method is not as effective, especially
to probe the apo-protein or partially metalated states. More recently,
however, structural information about MT has been obtained through
the reaction profiles of cysteine modifiers that take advantage of
MT’s cysteine rich structure. p-Benzoquinone
(pBQ) and N-ethyl maleimide (NEM)
are organic agents capable of binding covalently with free thiols,
as shown in Scheme 2. Similarly to Ellman’s reagent (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid)), this irreversible binding permits quantification of free thiols.37,92,106−108 This is observed as a predictable mass change, but in addition with
respect to MT and its 20 cysteines, the modified speciation distribution
can also provide information about the solvent accessibility of the
cysteines.108 This technique has been used
to understand metalation of apo-βαMT through partially
metalated and fully metalated Cu6MT, Cu13MT,
Cu20MT, and As6MT.89,92

Scheme 2 Structure and Reaction Mechanism Involved in the Formation of Covalent
Bonds between Cysteine and Modifiers pBQ (A, Top)
and NEM (B, Bottom)
In this present study, we used both pBQ and NEM in conjunction with mass spectrometry to quantify the
number of free cysteines and to probe the surface structure and the
solvent accessibility of the partially metalated states of Rh2MT, Rh4MT, and Rh6MT. Structural characteristics
can be inferred from the reaction profile of modification observed
in the mass spectral data.106 As expected,
the higher metalated Rh4 and Rh6-bound MT shows
less solvent accessibility because of the lower spread of the p(BQ)-modified species. The most solvent accessible species,
Rh2MT, shows two distinct distributions, indicating that
two metalated states are created. From the change in intensity for
the higher metalated states, we can infer that only one of the observed
Rh2MT species is capable of further metalation, as described
pictorially in Chart 1. This rigidity is reflected again with the lowered abundance of
Rh4MT and Rh6MT and in the decrease of the relative
log Kf values showing that progressive
metalation is less favorable.

The data in Figure 8 show modification of MT containing Rh2MT, Rh4MT, and Rh6MT by both pBQ (Figure 8A,B, left half) and NEM (Figure 8, right half). The Rh2MT, Rh4MT, and Rh6MT spectra measured prior to modification are
shown in Figure 8,
top (A,C). In B,D, these same species are present (identified by triangles)
even though excess modifier was added. Both sets of modified species
(Figure 8, lower) display
a variety of normally distributed species, as shown in Figure 8 in bar graph format (see Supporting Information for experimental data).
As described by Irvine and Stillman, cysteine accessibility can be
understood by the distribution of cysteine modified species.106 A normal distribution represents statistically
equal accessibility of the modifier to all available free cysteines.
This means that the unbound cysteines are exposed. Therefore, the
breadth or spread of the distribution tells us the number of available
cysteines, and the shape of the distribution tells us if there is
conformation specificity or equal accessibility of the free thiols. Figure 8B shows the distribution
of the modified Rh2(BQ)xMT
species (red bars). The data indicate the presence of two species,
one with x = 0–8 free cysteines and another
with x = 10–15 free cysteines. This means
that there are two distinct Rh2MT products: one coordinating
the Rh2 with 12 cysteines and the other coordinating the
Rh2 with 5 cysteines. This is harder to distinguish at
increased concentrations as the abundancies of the two distributions
overlap each other, Figure 7D. The steep rise of the modified Rh4(BQ)yMT (blue) also displays a normal distribution with y = 0–7 free cysteines. The formation of a modified
Rh6(BQ)zMT species with z = 0–4 free cysteines also can be observed (green).

of pBQ. (C) Nonmodified Rh2-, Rh4-, and Rh6-MT, represented by a triangle. (D) Solution

bar graph representation (see Supporting Information for experimental data). Persistent titrations to excess and long
incubation times did not affect the resulting spectra indicating completed
reaction. Rh2MT species shown in red, Rh4MT
species in blue, and Rh6MT species in green.

There is a small discrepancy between the number
of modified cysteines observed using pBQ and NEM.
This is likely due to the reaction occurring at physiological pH,
at which pBQ is not as effective as NEM.108 Therefore, our conclusions about the number
of free cysteines for the metalated MT is based on the greatest number
of NEM-modified cysteines for each Rh-bound complex.

Three-Dimensional
Models: Cysteine Accessibility throughout Metalation
Three-dimensional
structures constructed using molecular mechanics (MM)/molecular dynamics
(MD) modeling techniques from previously reported AsMT109,110 and CdMT111,112 metalated forms were adapted
to examine the possible metal thiolate constructs MT may adopt when
bound to dirhodium cores. The absence of aromatic and hydrophobic
residues and the absence of disulfide bonds mean that the driving
force for protein folding is the cross-linking that results from the
metalation of the cysteines, stabilized by hydrogen bond formation.
As the cysteine modification results and the MD structures indicate,
metal-free cysteine thiolates are found to be solvent accessible,113 while holo-cysteines are buried within the
protein structure. MD calculations on the holo-Rh6MT show
no change in the conformational geometry, demonstrating the holo-MT’s
rigid status.

Representative structures of apo-βαMT,
Rh2MT, Rh4MT, and Rh6MT are shown
in Figure 9. Energy-minimized
geometries using MD for apo-βαMT, Rh2MT, Rh4MT, and Rh6MT were constructed in Scigress 6.0.0
and geometry optimized using molecular mechanics (MM3) prior to MD
calculations at 300 K for 500 ps. These structures are shown in ball
and stick format in Figure 9 and in full page format along with H-bond mapping in the Supporting Information.

Figure 9 Energy minimized MD models
of apo-βαMT (A), Rh2MT (B–D), Rh4MT (E–G), and Rh6MT (H). Rh shown enlarged
in teal, cysteines shown enlarged in yellow, C in gray, O in red,
N in blue, and H in white. Structures are based on Cd7MT
structures from previously reported,111,112,116 using Scigress 6.0.0 details of the minimization
are given in the text.

The apo-βαMT model, Figure 9A, shows the structure of the nonmetalated
cysteines and how MT orients itself with respect to metalation. The
energy minimization of apo-βαMT results in a compact globular
structure, in accordance with mass spectral studies at physiological
pH.113 The cysteine residues (−SH
shown with yellow spheres in Figure 9) are oriented to the exterior when metal-free, but
coalesce toward the interior of the protein when metal-bound. In the
apo-βαMT structure, the backbone and cysteines arrange
themselves in a similar fashion to a helix, with cysteines facing
outward. This agrees with results from Irvine et al. and Rigby et
al. that the cysteine solvent accessibility in the apo form facilitates
metal binding.101,114,115

The driving force for organized structural formation in mammalian
MTs is the metal-induced folding with each sequential M–SCYS chelation event.101 Once bound
to a metal, these cysteines become buried within the protein interior,
shielding them from the cellular environment. The fully bound Rh6MT (Figure 9H, “Rh2β4αMT”) shows this clearly.
The configuration of the peptide backbone shows that MT wraps around
the metal core upon binding. This effect is observed in the partially
metalated Rh2MT and Rh4MT structures as well,
in Figure 9. When the
Rh2 is bound to cysteines that nominally form a single
domain (Figure 9; Rh2βMT, Rh2αMTI, Rh2αMTII, and Rh4αMT), the metal-bound cysteines are
buried, while the remaining metal-free cysteines maintain their external
orientation. This reflects the globular protein structure seen in
the apo-MT model, Figure 9A. However, these one-domain-bound MTs are fluxional and capable
of further subsequent metalation. In contrast, for two-domain metal
binding, like in the Rh2β2αMTI, Rh2β2αMTII, and Rh6MT, a dumb-bell-like structure typical of
M(II) ion metalation is obtained.88 When
both domains are bound, the cysteine accessibility is greatly diminished.
We consider that this accounts for the lower abundance of the Rh6MT species in the mass spectral data.

Nontraditional Metalation
and Comparison of Binding Constants across Metals
Metal binding
to MT is generally fluxional such that the metal ions can move from
site to site in search of the lowest thermodynamic product (e.g.,
the well-known change in Cu(I)-MT emission signal when Cu(I) is titrated
into Zn-MT 1A or Zn-MT 2A).117 In the case
of the dimeric rhodium binding, the bound cysteines form multiple
metalated species (Chart 1). The orientation of the initial metal binding in relation
to the MT cysteines defines how the metalation proceeds. Because of
the decreased abundance of Rh4MT and Rh6MT,
the domain location and formation of Rh2MT determine whether
the metalation continues to Rh6MT. The two distributions
for the Rh2(BQ)xMT-modified
speciation data reflect these products. The decrease in relative log Kf’s demonstrates its rigidity as metalation
progresses (Table 1). From previous work with the single β domain fragment, we
know that the β-domain accommodates 1 Rh2 moiety.78 The 11 cysteines of the α reside can accommodate
the remaining 2Rh2 if metalated efficiently (Chart 1, right pathway B). If not,
the cysteines become too tangled to accommodate further metals (Chart 1, left pathway A).

The relative Kf’s reported in Table 1 must be in absolute
values, be greater than the Kf of Cd,
as Rh2(OAc)4 binds MT at a lower pH than Cd.
However, at this time, we do not know the absolute values of this
complicated reaction. Directly comparing the metalation reaction between
chemically different metals is difficult, because of both different
binding geometries and the presence of competitive coordinating ligands.
A comparison of metalation pathways can only be made meaningfully
between isomorphous metals. Just as Cu(I) metalation of MT differs
from Cd(II) metalation, metal ion accumulation like this in MT cannot
be compared to the non-traditional, deconstructive process that MTs
exert on ligated metal complexes, as described here for Rh2(OAc)4.

Conclusions
We report the reaction
of a xenobiotic complex with MT as a test of the possible chelation
properties of MTs with transition metal complexes. Rh2(OAc)4, a robust synthetic catalyst, binds intact to the metal-free
apo-βαMT. The tetraacetate ligands are rapidly removed
upon binding by the folded MT at physiological pH, in a manner reported
previously for cisplatin. The initial reaction of the apo-βαMT
involves the displacement of tetraacetate groups by the cysteinyl
thiolates. The location and space within MT that the first Rh2 binds in the protein, which domain, governs the remaining
space in which metalation can continue. This intermediate state can
then proceed toward two structures, one of which allows the metalation
of a third dirhodium moiety, forming Rh6MT, and the other
pathway stops at Rh4MT. These branching pathways were determined
using complementary techniques of cysteine modification and mass spectrometry,
together providing speciation data for equilibrium reaction modeling.

The increase in global exposure to anthropogenic xenobiotic metals
demands updated understanding of the metabolic effects caused. Rh
and PGMs are known to exert cytotoxic and nephrotoxic activity, through
metabolic process that can increase the bioavailability. Our report
demonstrates the ease with which biological structures can greatly
change the chemical activity of rhodium. A metal’s persistence
through biological metabolism in ever changing chemical forms emphasizes
the need for long-term study and caution for the continued utilization
of these elements for human health.

Finally, of concern, we
note that long term accumulation and storage of PGMs can provoke chronic
toxic effects. Cd-bound MT has a reported half-life in the kidneys
exceeding 20 years.118 Because of the firm
and rigid binding of Rh2(OAc)4 to MT, Rh would
be expected to accumulate in a similarly dangerous manner, hindering
normal MT function. The heavy and widespread use of PGMs and their
related metals and contaminants pose a risk that cannot be ignored,
as history would remind us with the use of lead in gasoline and paints
causing widespread toxic effects. This long-term storage is also applicable
for these xenobiotic metals. The bioaccumulation of metals can pose
a significant health risk in the future.

Methods
Preparation
of Apo-βαMT
Recombinant human MT 1a (rh-βαMT
1a, referred when used in this study as “MT” unless
specified otherwise) was overexpressed with an S-tag in Escherichia coli. The S-tag was removed and the MT
purified according to previously described methods.89,111 The cleaved construct has the sequence GSMGKAAAACSCATGGSCTCTGSCKCKECKCNSCKKSCCSCCPMSCAKCAQGCVCKGASEKCSCCAKKAAAA.
This construct contains two mutations when compared with the human
MT 1A sequence archived on UniProt protein database, T27N and I51V.
These mutations are commonly found in other mammalian MTs including
other human isoforms (see Supporting Information Figure S2 for sequence comparison) and are not involved in metalation
reactions of the cysteinyl thiolates.119 The purified Cd-bound MT1a was demetalated by acidification (pH
< 2), and the resulting free Cd(II) in solution was removed by
centrifugal filtration (Amicon Ultra-4 3000 Da MWCO). Protein concentration
was calculated by remetalating a measured aliquot with CdSO4 and determining the Amax at the 250
nm shoulder characteristic of the LMCT band of Cd–S bonds (ε
= 89 000 L mol–1 cm–1).120

Because of the highly sensitive nature
of MTs to oxidation, all solutions are thoroughly evacuated and saturated
with Ar.

UV–Visible Absorption and CD Spectroscopy
UV–visible
absorption and CD spectral data were acquired on Cary UV Bio50 and
JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeters, respectively. Solutions were evacuated
and backfilled with Ar gas prior to data collection and measured in
a sealed, 1 cm × 1 cm quartz cuvette.

ESI-MS Studies
Solutions of Rh2(OAc)4 (Sigma-Aldrich) were
prepared in deoxygenated, argon-aerated, deionized water. Aliquots
containing known molar equivalents were added to the apo-MT solution
immediately prior to mass spectral data acquisition using a micrOTOF
II (Bruker Daltonics, Toronto). All solutions were at room temperature
and thoroughly deaerated using vacuum evacuation followed by Ar saturation.
NaI was used as the calibrant. Spectra were collected in positive
ion mode, as a function of time following mixing. The settings used
are described in the Supporting Information. The averaged spectra and data analysis were carried out using the
maximum entropy application in Bruker DataAnalysis 4.2 program. The
resulting spectral data were normalized, and the dominant species
were identified by mass.

Cysteine Modification by pBQ and NEM
Stock solutions of pBQ and NEM
(10 mM) were dissolved in 10% v/v methanol in water, and the solution
vials were wrapped in aluminum foil to protect from photochemical
degradation. Aliquots of the modifiers were added to protein samples
containing Rh2, Rh4, and Rh6MT, and
mass spectral data of the resulting products were obtained to identify
the species present. The modifier was titrated to excess, until the
mass spectra no longer changed between additions.

MD Models of
Rh2MT, Rh4MT, and Rh6MT Structures
Molecular modeling calculations were carried out using Scigress
Version 6.0.0 (Fujitsu Poland Ltd.). Structures, modeling parameters
and sequence information were adapted from previously reported Cd7MT and As6MT models to build the Rh2MT models.111,112,121 In brief, the Cd(II) ions were deleted and replaced with Rh(II)
prior to molecular mechanics calculations (MM3). MD calculations were
carried out at 300 K for 500 ps using the dielectric constant for
water of 78.5. Metal thiolate structures in the α domain were
based on bridging thiol arrangements in Cd7MT.

Methodology
Spectroscopic and mass spectral studies provide the identity of
the binding moiety and detailed speciation data. The mass spectral
data were simulated computationally to determine the stepwise equilibrium
constants. Cysteine modification was used initially to determine the
metalation stoichiometry by quantifying the number of cysteines not
involved in binding the Rh2(OAc)4. However,
these results directed the research focus toward understanding the
protein structural changes in metalation, using MD modeling and mass
spectral titrations under unfolded conditions. Altogether, these experiments
fully document the metalation process by which xenobiotic dirhodium(II)
tetraacetate is accumulated by MT.
