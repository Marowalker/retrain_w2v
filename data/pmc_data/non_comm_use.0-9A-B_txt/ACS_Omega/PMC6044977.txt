Human embryonic kidney
293T cells (HEK293T cells) before and after
treatment with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were measured using advanced
atomic force microscopy (AFM) force measurement technique, and the
biomechanical property of cells was analyzed using a theoretical model.
The biomechanical results showed that the factor of viscosity of untreated
HEK293T cells reduced from 0.65 to 0.40 for cells exposure to 40 μg/mL
of AgNPs. Comet assay indicated that significant DNA damage occurred
in the treated cells, measured as tail DNA% and tail moment. Furthermore,
gene expression analysis showed that for the cells treated with 40
μg/mL of AgNPs, the antiapoptosis genes Bcl2-t and Bclw were, respectively, downregulated to 0.65-
and 0.66-fold of control, and that the proapoptosis gene Bid was upregulated to 1.55-fold of control, which indicates that apoptosis
occurred in cells exposed to AgNPs. Interestingly, excellent negative
correlations were found between the factor of viscosity and tail DNA%,
and tail moment, which suggest that the biomechanical property can
be correlated with genotoxicity of nanoparticles on the cells. Based
on the above results, we conclude that (1) AgNPs can lead to biomechanical
changes in HEK293T cells, concomitantly with biological changes including
cell viability, DNA damage, and cell apoptosis; (2) the factor of
viscosity can be exploited as a promising label-free biomechanical
marker to assess the nanotoxicity of nanoparticles on the cells; and
(3) the combination of AFM-based mechanical technique with conventional
biological methods can provide more comprehensive understanding of
the nanotoxicity of nanoparticles than merely by using the biological
techniques.

1 Introduction
Nanoparticles (NPs) have
attracted tremendous interest of scientists
due to their unique properties including large surface area, small
size, special surface chemistry, etc.1 As
a result, various NPs, for example, silver-, gold-, and silica-based
NPs have been synthesized in past decades for different applications
such as drug delivery, cancer diagnostics and therapy, and antiseptic
sprays and bandages.2−4 Almost simultaneously, the biosafety of NPs has also
been receiving increasing attention by the scientific communities,
with the wide applications of NPs contained products and devices.5−7 Consequently, the effects of NPs on eukaryotic cells have been intensively
investigated, mainly with fluorescence-based detection techniques
such as 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) test, comet assay, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), flow cytometry,
and fluorescence microscopy, to examine cell viability, DNA damage,
gene expression, etc.8−11 Indeed, it has been found that many NPs have toxicity to cells and
can lead to cell death or change in cell state, normally in a dose-dependent
manner.12−14 Although significant information has been obtained
using these biological techniques in terms the toxicity of NPs, the
molecules within or extracted from the cells are usually required
to be labeled specifically for the detection in these biological techniques,
which can lead to high cost, time consumption, false positive or negative
results, etc.

With the rapid development of nanotechnology,
there has been an
increasing consensus that cell state can not only be evaluated by
using biological techniques but also be examined using biomechanical
techniques, particularly atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based force
measurement techniques.15−19 AFM is a powerful tool for the mechanical measurement of living
cells in near-physiological conditions and can be employed to study
the biological processes and functions of cells from the perspective
of mechanics. For example, the biological response of influx of Ca2+ into the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells triggered by
the opening of ligand-gated ion channels could be examined using AFM-based
mechanical measurements.20 More recently,
we used the factor of viscosity to evaluate the action of an anticancer
drug (docetaxol) on HeLa cells and found that docetaxol-treated cells
had a smaller factor of viscosity than the untreated cells.18 These studies demonstrated that the mechanical
properties of cells are very sensitive to the cell state/functional
change, strongly implicating that the influence of NPs on cells could
be examined using AFM-based mechanical measurements. Compared to those
fluorescence-based techniques, the AFM-based biomechanical techniques
are label-free and can assess the cell state from the perspective
of mechanics. Therefore, AFM-based biomechanical techniques are promising
for the evaluation of the toxicity of NPs on cells. The combination
of AFM biomechanical measurement with biological techniques should
be able to provide more comprehensive insights into the toxicity of
NPs on cells than only by using biological methods, which is critical
for accurately assessing the biosafety of NPs. Silver nanoparticles
(AgNPs) have been reported as promising antibacterial agents and tumor
inhibitors, and the toxicity of AgNPs has been investigated intensively
in recent years.21−23 However, little work has been carried out to evaluate
the toxicity of AgNPs on cells from the perspective of biomechanics,
which impedes our comprehensive understanding of the nanotoxicity
of AgNPs.

The human embryonic kidney 293T cell (HEK293T) is
a cell line derived
from the human embryonic kidney cell and has been widely used as the
model cell in the studies of NPs’ toxicity.24 In the present work, we aimed to interrogate the nanotoxicity
of NPs on eukaryotic cells by employing a sophisticated AFM-based
biomechanical technique, and explored the influence of AgNPs on HEK293T
cells. The toxicity of AgNPs on HEK293T cells was also investigated
biologically using the MTT assay, single cell gel electrophoresis,
and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to
examine the cell viability, DNA damage, and gene expression, respectively.
The mechanical data showed that the factor of viscosity of cells was
significantly decreased from 0.65 for untreated cells to 0.40 for
the cells treated with 40 μg/mL of AgNPs. The biological results
indicated that AgNPs exposure decreased cell viability, increased
DNA damage, downregulated Bcl-2t and Bclw genes, and upregulated the Bid gene. Bcl-2t and Bclw are antiapoptosis genes, whereas Bid is a proapoptosis gene.11,25,26 Interestingly, the factor of viscosity was found
to be negatively correlated with the DNA damage measured as tail DNA%
and tail moment. The work demonstrated here suggests that AFM-based
biomechanical measurement can provide researchers a physical and label-free
means to assess the nanotoxicity of NPs on cells, and that the combination
of the mechanical technique with biological methods can provide a
more comprehensive understanding of the nanotoxicity of NPs on cells
than merely by using biological techniques.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Cell Viability Test
The optical microscopic
images of HEK293T cells upon treatment with AgNPs are shown in Figure 1. From Figure 1A, it can be seen that HEK293T
cells without exposure to AgNPs (control) show a spindle shape, which
is typical for untreated HEK293T cells.8,27 However, the
cells treated with AgNPs present clear alterations in both morphology
and number (Figure 1B,C), i.e., the cells tended to turn into a roundish shape and the
cell density gradually decreased with increasing concentration of
AgNPs, similar to the effect of graphene oxide sheets on HEK293T cells
and other drugs or NPs on HeLa cells and/or MDA-MB-231 cells.8,18,28 The morphological and inhibitory
changes indicated that AgNPs are cytotoxic to HEK293T cells.

Figure 1 Representative
images of HEK293T cells following exposure to varying
AgNPs concentrations for 24 h, observed using an inverted optical
microscope: (A) 0 μg/mL, (B) 10 μg/mL, (C) 20 μg/mL,
and (D) 40 μg/mL.

To further confirm this, the cell viability was assessed
using
the MTT assay and quantified according to eq 1. Compared to the control group, the treated
HEK293T cells indeed showed decreased viability with increasing concentration
of AgNPs and the cell viability was about 69.07% of the control when
the concentration of AgNPs reached 40 μg/mL (Figure 2). This trend is consistent
with the previous studies that the cytotoxicity of AgNPs on HeLa cells,
U937 cells, and HCT116 cells is dose-dependent and increases with
the concentration of AgNPs in a certain range.29,30Figure 2 Cell
viability of HEK293T cells tested by the MTT assay. HEK293T
cells were treated with varying AgNPs concentrations (0, 10, 20, and
40 μg/mL) for 24 h. Following treatment with MTT reagents, viable
cells were quantified by measuring the OD490 of sample
wells. * indicates p < 0.05 and ** indicates p < 0.01.



2.2 Mechanical Property of HEK293T Cells
The effects of AgNPs on HEK293T cells were evaluated by measuring
the cellular mechanical properties using an AFM force measurement
technique. From the force versus distance curve, the factor of viscosity,
φ, can be obtained according to eq 2. As shown in Figure 3, the viscous energy, originating from the energy dissipation
in the process of deforming the cell, is the hysteresis between the
approach and retraction curves, indicated by the yellow area encompassed
by the approach curve, retraction curve, and zero-force line. The
elastic energy is the energy for the cellular deformation recovery,
indicated by the green area formed by the positive portion of the
retraction force curve and the zero-force line. The factor of viscosity
is equal to the ratio of the viscous energy to the total energy (the
summation of the viscous energy and the elastic energy) exerted on
the cell in the process of deforming the cell. Previous studies have
suggested that the factor of viscosity is a much more meaningful physical
parameter than the usually used Young’s modulus obtained by
the Hertz–Sneddon model because cells are viscoelastic materials
and, strictly speaking, cannot be modeled as an ideal elastic body
using the Hertz–Sneddon model.18

Figure 3 Biomechanical
analysis of HEK293T cells in phosphate buffer solution
(PBS) buffer. A sample force versus distance curve obtained on an
untreated HEK293T cell shows the tip approach (red) and withdrawal
(back). The energy involved in the indentation process includes two
parts: elastic energy (green) and viscous energy (yellow).

The calculated factor of viscosity of the cells
treated with varying
concentrations of AgNPs (0, 10, 20, and 40 μg/mL) was plotted
to a histogram, respectively (Figure 4A–D). For each concentration, more than 300
curves were measured and calculated to obtain the factor of viscosity.
The plots were fitted to Gaussian function to obtain the mean value
of the factor of viscosity that is summarized in Table 1. As shown in Figure 4D and Table 1, the factor of viscosity for the cells treated
with 40 μg/mL AgNPs has two values, i.e., 0.42 (peak #1) and
0.60 (peak #2), indicating that the cells can be roughly categorized
into two different groups, i.e., cells strongly influenced by AgNPs
and cells tolerant to AgNPs. In fact, the morphology of the cells
has been observed to be uneven from the optical microscopy image (Figure 1D), which also indicates
that cells with different states exist on the sample, likely due to
the response of cell heterogeneity on nanoparticle dose.31,32 Cells with different morphologies were also observed for HeLa cells
and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with selenium nanoparticles.28 Because individual cells were randomly targeted
in AFM force measurement, cells with different states could be measured;
as a result, the calculated factor of viscosity has more than one
value.

The cells were treated with (A) 0 μg/mL, (B) 10 μg/mL,
(C) 20 μg/mL, and (D) 40 μg/mL AgNPs for 24 h, respectively.

Factor of Viscosity

20	0.54 ± 0.01*	
40	0.42 ± 0.01 (peak #1)**	
 	0.60 ± 0.01 (peak #2)	
a * Indicates p <
0.05 and ** indicates p < 0.01.

Compared to 0.65 of the control,
the factor of the viscosity of
cells after AgNPs exposure was decreased to 0.64 for 10 μg/mL,
0.54 for 20 μg/mL, and 0.42 (peak #1) for 40 μg/mL. The
values of 0.54 and 0.42 are significantly different from 0.65 for
the control. These results mean that the influence of AgNPs on HEK293T
cells can be detected mechanically. Considering both MTT test (Figure 2) and calculated
factor of viscosity (Table 1), it is clear that the lower the cell viability, the lower
the factor of viscosity. From its definition, it is easy to understand
that the lower the factor of viscosity, the higher the relative cellular
elasticity (related to higher elastic energy).

It has been well
recognized that biomechanical changes are connected
to the cytoskeletal alterations.33,34 In a recent
study, Huang et al. found that the shape of human dermal fibroblasts
was changed from a normal spindle to a triangle when the cells were
exposed to AgNPs for a long time, concomitantly with partial cytoskeletal
contraction and actin filament rearrangement along the cell periphery.35 In our present work, the changes in the cellular
morphology such as shape and size with the increase in AgNPs concentration
(see Figure 1) also
strongly indicate the alterations of cytoskeleton, which should be
mainly responsible for the biomechanical changes of the cells, measured
by the variation in the factor of viscosity. However, because NPs–cytoskeleton
interaction is a new research area, the underlying mechanisms regarding
the influence of NPs on cytoskeleton change and the contribution of
cytoskeleton change to cellular mechanical properties are still unclear
and imperative to be further investigated by the scientific community
to fully understand the cytotoxicity of NPs.

2.3 DNA Damage
The toxicity of AgNPs
on HEK293T cells was further studied using comet assay, which is a
robust method to perform genotoxicity measurements.36 It can be seen from Figure 5 that the comet tail becomes more evident with increasing
concentration of AgNPs, as compared to the comet head, indicating
higher levels of DNA damage in the cells. The percentage of DNA in
the comet tail (tail DNA%) and tail moment were two preferable parameters
used to quantify DNA damages.37,38 Tail DNA% is defined
as 100× comet tail DNA intensity/whole cell DNA intensity, whereas
tail moment equals tail DNA% × length of comet tail. The statistical
results of tail DNA% and tail moment are presented in Table 2. The parameters are significantly
increased after the cell exposure to AgNPs (10, 20, and 40 μg/mL)
for 24 h, in comparison with the control.

detected by comet assays for HEK293T cells
treated with varying AgNPs concentrations for 24 h: (A) 0 μg/mL,
(B) 10 μg/mL, (C) 20 μg/mL, and (D) 40 μg/mL.

More interestingly, significant dose response trends were found
for both the tail DNA% and the tail moment using linear regression
(Figure 6). The goodness
of fit (adj. R2) was very high for the
samples exposed to different doses of AgNPs. In recent studies, it
was found that the DNA damage measured as tail DNA% in coelomocytes
of earthworms appeared as a positive linear response to the dose of
γ radiation,37 and that the DNA damage
in peripheral blood leukocytes of different groups of mice showed
a linear gradual increase with age.39 In
this work, we also found that the DNA damage in HEK293T cells caused
by AgNPs can be evaluated using tail DNA% and tail moment, and that
the two parameters linearly increase with the concentration of AgNPs.

in terms of (A) tail DNA% and (B) tail moment obtained at different
AgNPs concentrations (0, 10, 20, and 40 μg/mL), fitted each
with a linear regression line.

2.4 mRNA Expression Profiles of Selected Genes
To deeply understand the mechanisms of the action of AgNPs on HEK293T
cells, several key genes, including antiapoptotic Bcl2-t and Bclw genes and proapoptotic Bid gene, were analyzed using qRT-PCR (Figure 7). The results showed that Bcl2-t expression levels reduced significantly to 0.57-, 0.63-, and 0.65-fold
of the control level, respectively, after the cell exposure to 10,
20, and 40 μg/mL AgNPs for 24 h. Under the same treatment, the
expression levels of Bclw were decreased to 0.9-,
0.78-, and 0.66-fold of the control level, whereas those of Bid were upregulated to 1.31-, 1.38-, and 1.55-fold of the
control level. After exposure to AgNPs (40 μg/mL), Bclw was significantly downregulated, whereas Bid was
significantly upregulated. The data strongly suggested that AgNPs
induced apoptosis in HEK293T cells at a high AgNPs concentration (40
μg/mL),11,14 consistent with the fact that
AgNPs can induce HePG-2 cells apoptosis.12

2.5 Correlation between the Biomechanics with
DNA Damage
In this work, the factor of viscosity was used
as a biomarker to evaluate the influence/toxicity of AgNPs on cells.
On the other hand, the DNA damage was also investigated after the
cell exposure to AgNPs by using the widely accepted comet assay. To
understand the biological origin of the biomechanical change, it is
important to see whether or not the factor of viscosity can be correlated
to the DNA damage. To do this, the correlation between the change
of factor of viscosity and the change of tail DNA%, and the change
of tail moment was analyzed using Origin 8.5 software, respectively.
It was found the correlation coefficient (Pearson coefficient) for
the change of factor of viscosity and the change of tail DNA% is −0.99
(p < 0.05) and that for the change of factor of
viscosity and the change of tail moment is −0.99 (p < 0.005). It is a very interesting result because the mechanical
data are highly negatively correlated with the biological data, indicating
that the mechanical properties might be closely related with the DNA
damage and that the factor of viscosity can be employed as an effective
label-free biomechanical marker to assess the cytotoxicity of NPs.
To our knowledge, the mechanical properties of the cells were first
found to be well correlated with the DNA damage in cells upon exposure
to NPs.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
the factor of viscosity calculated from the AFM biomechanical
measurements was introduced to investigate the biomechanical properties
of the cells with or without treatment with AgNPs. In addition, conventional
biological techniques including MTT test, comet assay, and gene expression
analysis were employed to evaluate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity
of AgNPs. The biomechanical results showed that the factor of viscosity
was reduced with increasing AgNPs concentrations, indicating that
cellular structural changes occurred upon treatment with AgNPs. Biological
results demonstrated decreased cell viability, increased DNA damage,
downregulated antiapoptosis Bcl2-t and Bclw genes, and upregulated proapoptosis Bid gene for
the cells exposure to AgNPs with increasing concentrations. Most importantly,
it was discovered that the factor of viscosity can be well correlated
with DNA damage, corroborating the effectiveness of using a biomechanical
marker (the factor of viscosity) to assess the nanotoxicity of AgNPs.
It needs to pointed out that the nanotoxicity of AgNPs at high concentrations
in the cells is worthy of further investigation by developing suitable
biocompatible surface modification techniques that enable the attachment
of cells treated with high concentration AgNPs on a substrate for
the AFM force measurement. Taken together, the findings in our present
work demonstrated that the biomechanical technique can be used as
a very useful means in the study of nanotoxicity of NPs from the mechanical
perspective, and that the combination of AFM-based mechanical techniques
with biological means can help us obtain more comprehensive insights
into the toxicity of NPs than just by using biological techniques.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 AgNPs Solutions
AgNPs (CAS No. 7440-22-4,
particle size ∼60 nm measured by transmission electron microscopy,
99% trace metals basis) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai,
China). The AgNPs powder was suspended in Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ/cm,
Millipore, Billerica, MA) and sonicated at 50 W/L, 40 kHz for 50 min
to prepare the stock solution (1 mg/mL). The surface charge of AgNPs
was ∼−40 mV, measured by a Zetasizer Nano ZS apparatus
(Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, U.K.). The stock solution was
freshly prepared every 24 h to keep the quality consistent and further
diluted into cell culture media to the desired AgNPs concentrations
(10, 20, and 40 mg/L) before the cell exposure experiments.

4.2 Cells Culture and Cell Viability Measurement
HEK293T
cells (American Type Culture Collection, CRL-11268, Shanghai,
China) were cultured in Gibco Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium
1640 basic (1×) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco,
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai, China) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
solution (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China) at 37 °C in an incubator
humidified with 5% CO2 atmosphere.

The cells were
seeded in 96-well plates (100 μL/well) with a density of ∼1
× 104 cells/well and grown for 12 h at 37 °C.
Then, the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with
phosphate buffer solution (PBS, HyClone, Beijing, China). Afterward,
the cells were exposed to different concentrations of AgNPs solutions
(10, 20, and 40 μg/mL) by adding 100 μL AgNPs solution
to each well. The media containing no AgNPs were used as control.
The cells were then grown for a further 24 h at 37 °C.

The viability of the cells after exposure to AgNPs was analyzed
using a cell proliferation kit (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China).
Briefly, 10 μL of 5 mg/mL MTT solution in the PBS buffer was
added to each well and the cells were allowed to grow for another
4 h. The MTT-containing medium was removed and the cells were then
treated by adding 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide to each well
to dissolve the formazan crystal formed by live cells. The plates
were then transferred to a microplate reader (Epoch, BioTek Instruments
Inc., Shoreline, WA) and the absorbance (optical density (OD)) value
of the wells was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. The data for each condition represents
the average values taken from three replicate wells performed in three
independent experiments. The measured absorbance value (OD) of the
wells was used to calculate the inhibition rate, via the formula 1  Upon the completion
of the MTT assay, the
cell morphology was examined by observing the plates using an inverted
optical microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, TH4-200, Japan).

4.3 Nanomechanical Measurement and Analysis of
HEK293T Cells Using AFM
For mechanical measurements, 3 mL
of HEK293T cell solution (∼1 × 105 cells/mL)
was seeded in a Petri dish (60 mm × 15 mm, Corning Inc., New
York, NY) coated with poly-l-lysine and the cells were cultured
for 12 h at 37 °C at 5% CO2. The supernatant was removed
and the cells were washed with PBS twice. Afterward, the cells were
exposed to different concentrations of AgNPs (10, 20, and 40 μg/mL)
or cell culture media (control) by adding 3 mL solution to each Petri
dish. Afterward, the cells were allowed to grow for further 24 h at
37 °C at 5% CO2. Finally, the culture media were replaced
with 3 mL of PBS and the Petri dish was mounted on the AFM stage immediately
for the experiments. It needs to be pointed out that poly-l-Lysine is a biocompatible material that has been widely used for
helping the adhesion of cells on the substrate in the AFM experiments
and showed no obvious influence on cell viability.18,40

Force curves were acquired using the Dimension Edge instrument
(Bruker Nano Surfaces, Santa Barbara, CA) in PBS buffer with commercial
AFM probes (DNP-10). The probes were purchased from Bruker Corporation
(Camarillo, CA) and their nominal spring constant was 0.06 N/m (according
to manufacturer specifications). The spring constant of each probe
used was calibrated against the stiff surface of Petri dish in PBS
buffer by taking advantage of the thermal tune function contained
in the AFM control software. The AFM system coupled with an optical
microscope allowed to precisely locate the AFM tip on the central
area of the cell. The force curves were taken at a velocity of 1 μm/s,
with a threshold loading force of ∼4.5 nN on each cell. The
cell structure appeared unaffected under this threshold force because
no abrupt drops or spikes were observed in the approach force curves.
Previous studies showed that if a cell was penetrated by the AFM tip
at high loading force, abrupt drops or spikes can be observed in the
approach force curve.41 At least 10 force
curves were measured on each cell and more than 30 cells from five
independent experiments were examined. The force–distance curves
were obtained by correcting the cantilever bending by deducting the
cantilever deflection from the z-piezo movement using a home-developed
code written by Igor Pro (version 6.04, Wavemetrics Inc., Lake Oswego,
OR). The zero point is the point at which the AFM cantilever begins
to deflect upward. The mechanical property of the cells was quantitatively
analyzed from the collected force–distance curves by the factor
of viscosity,17,18 which is defined by 2  Self-developed Matlab-based procedures (version
R2010a, Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA) were employed to carry out the
calculations.

4.4 Comet Assay
HEK293T
cells were seeded
in 6-well plates (∼3 × 105 cells/well, 3 mL/well)
and cultured for 12 h at 37 °C at 5% CO2, followed
by the removal of the supernatant and washing of the cells with PBS
twice (HyClone, Beijing, China). Afterward, the cells were exposed
to culture media containing different concentrations of AgNPs (0,
10, 20, and 40 μg/mL) by adding 3 mL solution to each well.
The cells were cultured for another 24 h at 37 °C at 5% CO2. The supernatant was removed and the cells were washed with
PBS twice. Afterward, the cells were collected into a centrifuge tube,
centrifuged, washed once with, and resuspended into precooling PBS
to a concentration of ∼1 × 105 cells/mL for
use in the following comet assay.

The comet assay is a widely
accepted technique for detecting cellular DNA damages, and Trevigen
Comet Assay Kit (Trevigen Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was employed in
the current study to measure the DNA damages by following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The procedures are very similar to our recent work.8

4.5 Gene Expression Profiling
in HEK293T Cells
After treatment by AgNPs for 24 h, an RNAiso
Plus reagent kit (Takara
Biochemicals, Dalian, China) was used to extract RNAs from HEK293T
cells cultured in 6-well plates according to the instruction provided
by the manufacturer. The synthesis of cDNA was performed using the
Primer Script RT reagent Kit (Takara Biochemicals, Dalian, China)
under the guidance of the manufacturer’s instructions. A SYBR
Green RCR Kit (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) was used to carry out qRT-PCR
experiments on an ABI 7300 System (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). The primers of target genes are listed in Table 3. All the samples
were tested in triplicates and repeated three times independently.
According to previous studies, β-actin mRNA was used as the
internal control,8,42 and the data of tested genes
were normalized to β-actin mRNA by using the 2–ΔΔCT method. The expression alterations in mRNA induced by AgNPs are
expressed in quantities relative to those of the control cells, correspondingly.

4.6 Statistical Analysis
The difference
between the variables was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance
followed by Dunnet test using SPSS17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL). Igor Pro (version 6.04, Wavemetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR) and
Matlab (version R2010a, MathWorks Inc., Natick, NY) codes were written
to extract the physical parameters from the force curves to obtain
the factor of viscosity. The correlation between the factor of viscosity
and the DNA damage was analyzed using Origin 8.5 software (OriginLab
Co., Northampton, NY). The data are presented as mean ± standard
error of mean. The statistical significance (p-value)
between the control and experimental groups is denoted by * (p < 0.05), or ** (p < 0.01), or ***
(p < 0.001).
