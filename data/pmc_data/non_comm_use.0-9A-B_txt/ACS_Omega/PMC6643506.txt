The
present study reports an enhancement of the power factor of
Bi2Te3 nanorods NRs) by helium (He+) ion irradiation. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy
studies revealed the formation of amorphous layers on the surface
of the NRs at the high ion fluence. This amorphous nature is due to
the accumulation of migrating point defect clusters at the surface
of the NRs. Raman scattering experiments provide further insight to
the observed structural modifications. At higher ion fluence, impurity-dominated
scattering processes significantly enhance the value of the Seebeck
coefficient of Bi2Te3 NRs. The He+ ion irradiation up to the ion fluence of 1 × 1016 ions/cm2 improves the thermoelectric transport properties
with the highest power factor, 8.2 μW/m K2, at 390
K. Further investigations may result in the possibility of fabricating
the Bi2Te3 NRs as thermoelectric generators
with a high power factor for space applications.

Introduction
Thermoelectric generators
(TEGs) are the eco-friendly solid-state
direct energy conversion devices that have been employed to generate
electricity by harvesting heat from various sources1 using the Seebeck effect. The long lasting, reliable, and
self-maintained TEG with no moving parts have been primarily used
for power generation,2,3 refrigeration, and sensing purposes4−7 in aerospace crafts, space satellites, and power plants. Self-generating
power sources are indispensable for every satellite to function. Radioisotope
TEGs (RTG) were employed for past decades to power up the deep space
exploring satellites8 (viz. Voyager 1 and
2). In RTG, silicon- and germanium-based thermoelectric (TE) devices
are normally operated in the temperature range of 973–1200
K with low power-conversion efficiency (≈4.4%) which are ultimately
used to generate power from the radioactive fuel Pu-238.9,10

The half-life of Pu-238 is high (i.e., 86.7 years) and decays
primarily
by α-particles. The absorption of the high-energy α-particles
by the one side of the TE devices will create temperature difference
and thus used to generate power during the deep space explorations.
The poor power conversion efficiency of silicon- and germanium-based
TE devices is due to their low figure of merit values. The figure
of merit of the TE materials is denoted by, , where S, σ,
κ
and T are Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity,
thermal conductivity, and absolute temperature, respectively. The
efficient TE material should possess high power factor (S2σ) as in conductors and low thermal conductivity
(κ) as in insulators. Furthermore, Caillat et al.,11 designed a revolutionary TE devices, which is
a combination of bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3),
and other novel materials (such as Zn4Sb3, CeFe4Sb12, and CoSb3). The conversion efficiency
of the above-mentioned TE device is rather high (≈10%) and
works in the temperature window of 300–975 K.

On the
other hand, unwanted thermal load provoked by the numerous
electronics produces heat flow inside the satellite. However, this
impotent heat flow (>400 K) will have a great impact on the overall
satellite temperature and hence its design. Usually, this unwanted
heat is collected and emitted by the radiator to the deep space. von
Lukowicz et al.,4 developed a model to
effectively harvest the waste heat that flows inside the satellite
by using Bi2Te3-based TE modules. It is found
that the power of ≈50 W could be generated by placing TEG between
active and inactive electronic components inside the satellite structure.

Bi2Te312 is one
of the intensively studied and commercialized room-temperature TE
materials that are having highest values of ZT. So
far, the highest value of ZT (≈1.1) has been
obtained for bulk Bi2Te3 that is obtained by
advanced synthetic process with spark plasma sintering.13 However, further improvement of the values of ZT is extremely difficult because of the interdependency
of TE transport properties. The TE transport properties are intertwined
with each other via electronic band structures. There are many reports
in the literature14−16 that the enhanced TE performances could be achieved
in the nanostructured TE materials (i.e., nanorods (NRs), nanotubes,
and thin films). This is primarily because of the process of the phonon
blocking effect and the density of states enhancement. For instance,
Zhu et al.17 reported the maximum ZT value of 0.77 at 464 K for hydrothermally synthesized
Bi2Te3 nanotubes. Further, Zhang et al.,18 reported the synthesis of ultra thin Bi2Te3 NRs through a solution phase method and have
the ZT value of 0.94 at 373 K. In addition to the
above bottom-up nano-structuring processes, Hu et al.,19 demonstrated the top-down hot deformation approach
to enhance the TE performance of Bi2Te3-based
solid solutions through the point defect engineering mechanism.20 Besides, Guo et al.,21 reported that the high pressure sintering technique significantly
improves the TE transport properties of (Bi,Sb)2Te3 alloys. The intervention of high pressure influences the
point defects and finally modulates the carrier concentration.22 Recently, Suh et al.23 demonstrated the alternative and effective atomic-scale point defect
engineering mechanism to improve the TE performances by employing
3 MeV He2+ ion irradiation.

Date back to 1960s, the
effect of various irradiation24−27 viz., thermal neutrons, reactor radiations, protons,
and inert gas
ions on TE transport properties of Bi2Te3 were
extensively studied. The formation of defect clusters and dislocations
in Bi2Te3 by 7.5 MeV proton irradiation were
observed.25 Moreover, it has been observed
that TE transport properties are extremely sensitive to the defects
generated during the ion irradiation and have positive and negative
impacts on the TE properties. More recently, Fu et al.,27 reported that 400 keV Ne+ ion irradiation
on Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 thin
films leads to 208 and 337% enhancement in its power factor. Such
an enhancement was due to ionization-induced enhanced crystallinity.
However, the enhancement of the TE transport properties is suppressed
at high ion fluences.

Thus, the controlled adjustment of the
TE transport properties
could be accomplished in TE materials via ion irradiation. This helps
to increase their applicability in the different fields. On the other
hand, the detailed investigation of the properties of the TE material
under an extreme environment is also important to rate the potential
of TEG for energy harvesting in satellites. In the present study,
we report in-detail about the effects of 100 keV He+ ion
irradiation on morphological, structural, and TE transport properties
of the hydrothermally synthesized p-type Bi2Te3 NRs.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a depicts
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the synthesized Bi2Te3 NRs. All the peaks of the diffraction pattern are
indexed to the rhombohedral structure of Bi2Te3 with lattice parameters of a = b = 4.39 Å and c = 30.15 Å as given in
the reference pattern: JCPDS 01-080-6959 (Figure 1b). Diffraction peaks corresponding to the
impurity phases are not observed. Using the Debye–Scherer formula,
the average crystallite size of the synthesized Bi2Te3 NRs is estimated to be ≈32.5 nm. Moreover, Figure 2a and 2b displays the field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) image of the hydrothermally synthesized Bi2Te3 NRs and the Bi2Te3 NRs pellet, respectively.
The inset of Figure 2a shows the diameter distribution of the Bi2Te3 NRs and found that the average diameter and length of the Bi2Te3 NRs are 80 nm and 2 μm, respectively.
Additionally, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS spectra, as
shown in Figure 3)
results revealed the presence of Bi and Te, and the atomic concentration
of Bi and Te is 44.8 and 55.2%, respectively. The values deviated
slightly from the exact stoichiometric values. The higher atomic concentration
of Bi is attributed to the occupation of Bi ions in the Te site (i.e.,
BiTe antisite defects). The formation energy of these defects
has the lowest value (i.e., 0.2 eV) in Bi-rich growth conditions.28 Additionally, the extra peaks that appeared
in the EDS spectrum were due to the Cu grid.

The FESEM image of the Bi2Te3 NRs pellets
before and after He+ ion irradiation is shown in Supporting Information (Figure S1). There are
no significant changes in the Bi2Te3 NRs pellets
are observed as a function of ion fluence. Hence, the 100 keV He+ ion induced changes in the microstructure of the Bi2Te3 NRs were further investigated using transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and is presented in Figure 4. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images
(Figure 4a−4d) and the concordant electron diffraction patterns
(Figure 4e−4h) of the pristine and 100 keV He+ ion
irradiated Bi2Te3 NRs are presented. Furthermore,
insets of Figure 4a−4d present the bright field TEM image of the Bi2Te3 NR for various ion fluences. Pristine Bi2Te3 NR (Figure 4a) exhibited better crystallinity, which is confirmed
from the bright spots in the diffraction pattern (Figure 4e). No significant changes
in the microstructure of the Bi2Te3 NRs are
observed until the ion fluence of 1 × 1016 ions/cm2 (not shown here). A thin disordered surface layer is observed
for the ion fluence of 5 × 1016 ions/cm2 (Figure 4b). The
extended thickness of disorder (≈6 nm), starting from the surface
of the NRs, is identified for the ion fluence of 1 × 1017 ions/cm2 (Figure 4c). Also, the appearance of the halo rings along with diffraction
spots (Figure 4f−4h) in the irradiated Bi2Te3 NRs signifies the coexistence of crystalline and amorphous phases.
As the ion fluence increases, the thickness of the amorphous layer
increases. In particular, for the highest ion fluence (2 × 1017 ions/cm2), amorphous nature was extended up to
≈9 nm (Figure 4d). The HRTEM investigations revealed the presence of the damage
layer and it gradually increases with ion fluence. The similar type
of layered damage accumulations29−31 are seen in ion-implanted GaN,
Si, Ge, etc. Figure 5 illustrates the systematic, gradual evolution of the amorphous volume
fraction in the Bi2Te3 NR as a function of ion
fluence.

The Monte-Carlo-based simulation namely transport and range
of
ions in matter32 (TRIM) was performed to
explain the above-observed microstructural changes. The estimated
range (as given in Figure S2) of 100 keV
He+ ion in bulk Bi2Te3 is ≈441
nm. It is well-established that an incidence of energetic ion loses
its energy via ballistic elastic collisions (i.e., nuclear energy
loss, Sn) and inelastic electronic excitations
(i.e., electronic energy loss, Se). In
our case, it is noted that the energy loss due to inelastic electronic
excitations (Se = 2.718 keV/nm) is dominated
over the elastic collisions (Sn = 0.039
keV/nm) with high electronic to nuclear energy loss ratio (Se/Sn) of ≈70.
The thermal spike model is the most commonly adopted model to describe
the inelastic energy loss predominant ion–beam interactions
such as swift heavy ion interactions with matter.33 The above model34−40 shed light on the physics behind the formation of latent tracks,
amorphous pockets, and amorphous zones in semiconductors and insulators.
Furthermore, Kucheyev et al.41 have found
out that irradiation of nanoporous silica with α-particles,
whose energy loss is not sufficient to melt the lattice, resulted
in the non-melting thermal spikes.

In the framework of the thermal
spike model, the paramount energy
of 100 keV He+ ion will be deposited locally to the electronic
subsystem of Bi2Te3 within 10–17 s. After the thermalization of the electronic system (in 10–15 s), the energy will be transferred from the electronic
system to lattice (in 10–14 s) through electron–phonon
and electron–electron interactions. This results in the increase
of local lattice temperature. The local melting and subsequent quenching
(i.e., thermal spike) occur as the local lattice temperature exceeds
the lattice melting point. The mathematical description of the time-dependent
thermal spike process is expressed as two coupled differential equations
in cylindrical geometry42 (eqs 1 and 2) 1   2  where Te, Ta, Ce, Ca, Ke, and Ka are the
temperature, the specific heat, and the thermal
conductivity for the electronic and atomic lattice systems, respectively. A(r, t) and B(r, t) are the radial energy density
per unit time supplied by the incident ion to the electronic system
from Se and to the atomic lattice system
from Sn, respectively.

The electron–phonon
coupling strength, g describes the ability of the
electrons to transfer its heat/energy
to the atomic lattice system and subsequently dictates the extent
of lattice heating due to energy transfer. The value of g can
be estimated from the values of electron
mean free path (λ = 61 nm) in the bulk Bi2Te3 and the electronic thermal conductivity Ke = 8.9 × 10–4 W/m K using the
Wiedemann–Franz relation, Ke =
σLT. Here, σ (=120 S/m) is the electrical
conductivity of Bi2Te3 pellet at temperature T (=300 K) and L is the Lorentz constant.
Henceforth, the value of g is evaluated to be 2.35
× 1011 W/m3 K, which is several orders
of magnitude lower than the reported values for effective energy transfer.
Thus, the weak electron–phonon interactions will allow the
electronic heat/energy to spread out more quickly (i.e., before 10–12 s) throughout the material. This results in the
shorter time for lattice to heat up and consequently could induce
rearrangement of atoms which gives rise to the production of vacancies
and interstitials.

Figure 6a shows
the vacancy profile of the 100 keV He+ ion irradiated 80
nm wide bulk Bi2Te3 target. However, the TRIM
simulations consider the flat and layered geometry of the target and
it is not applicable for nanostructured target materials (viz., NRs).
Because, fraction of ions would leave likelihood from the sides of
the NRs might result in the over-estimated value of displacements
(=9/ion) and vacancies (=8/ion). The iradina simulations43 (ion range and damage in nanostructures) are
similar to the TRIM simulations, except that it works on 3 dimensional
target geometries such as NRs and nanoparticles. The input data required
for iradina simulations are similar to the TRIM simulations such as
density of the target, energy, and mass of the projectile ions. The
output data of the iradina simulation consists of the profile of displaced
atoms, vacancies, and interstitials. Figure 6b demonstrates the iradina simulation of
the ion irradiation in NRs at normal incidence. The iradina simulation
was carried out on Bi2Te3 NR that was defined
as the cylinder with 80 nm in diameter. The slice of the NR was defined
by periodic boundary condition (PBC) along z axis.
The PBC refers the translational symmetry and hence the infinite length
along z axis. The NR slice was composed of 1600 cells.
Each cell acted as the counter that records the He+ ion
interaction events. The 100 keV He+ ion beam was projected
along x axis. The spatial distribution maps of displaced
atoms, vacancies, and interstitials in the simulated Bi2Te3 NRs are displayed in Figure 6c−6e. It depicted
that each 100 keV He+ ion displaced 3 atoms and create
2.8 vacancies and 2.7 interstitials.

maps of displaced atoms (c), vacancies (d) and interstitials (e) in

displaced atoms, vacancies, and interstitials in a simulated Bi2Te3 NR at varying fluences (f).

A typical cylindrical NR of diameter 80 nm and
length 2 μm
approximately contains 5 × 107 atoms and its ion beam-exposed
region would acquire 5 × 108 ions at the highest ion
fluence (i.e., 2 × 1017 ions/cm2). This
creates a large number of vacancies and interstitials (i.e., Frenkel
pair). The total number of displaced atoms, vacancies, and interstitials
in a simulated Bi2Te3 NR at varying ion fluence
are calculated and are plotted in Figure 6f. The total
number of displaced atoms in the typical NR is estimated to be around
108 to 109, while the total number of vacancies
and interstitials are also of the same order. However, these point
defects (created during irradiation) will migrate throughout the lattice
even at liquid nitrogen temperatures.30 Consequently, the NRs experience a complex dynamic annealing process
via direct and indirect defect recombination.30 Dynamic annealing processes are prominent in NRs,44 while vacancies (interstitials) are most likely to recombine
with interstitial (vacancy) complexes. This results in the generation
of large number of antisite defects and defect complexes. The surface
of the NR serves as an effective trap for migrating defects.45,46 The accumulation of more number of defect complexes at the surface
of the NR increases the free energy of the surfaces, which acts as
the nucleation site for amorphization, collapses into an energetically
favorable amorphous state. Hence, the thickness of the amorphous layer
continuously increases with increase in defect concentration (i.e.,
ion fluence).

The changes in the vibrational modes of the Bi2Te3 pellets under 100 keV He+ ion irradiation
with
ion fluence are displayed in Figure 7a−7f. The peaks in the
Raman spectra observed around 99, 118, and 136 cm–1 were assigned to Eg2, Au2, and Ag2 modes.47 The Raman active mode Eg2 portrays in-plane atomic displacement,
whereas out-of-plane atomic displacements are demonstrated by Ag2 (Raman active)
and Au2 (Raman
inactive/IR active) modes. The atomic displacements corresponding
to these vibration modes are shown in Figure 7. The activation of the Raman inactive vibration
mode (Au2) in
the pristine sample (Figure 7a) is owing to the effects of crystal symmetry breaking48−50 that has been reported earlier. The loss of translational symmetry
of the NRs is due to the presence of confinement where the higher
energies acquired by the atoms on the surface of the NRs and are about
to move out of the plane. Additionally, the third order symmetry breaking
provoked by the BiTe antisite defects in the pristine sample
(Bi-rich growth conditions), would also contribute to the IR active
mode of vibration.

Figure 7 Raman spectra of the (a) pristine and He+ ion
irradiated
Bi2Te3 NRs with ion fluence of (b) 5 ×
1015, (c) 1 × 1016, (d) 5 × 1016, (e) 1 × 1017, and (f) 2 × 1017 ions/cm2 respectively.

Upon ion irradiation, the Raman spectra of the Bi2Te3 NRs show the three major changes. First, He+ ion
irradiation affects the intensities of the in-plane (Eg2) and out-of-plane
vibrations (Au2 and Ag2).
The variations in the intensity of in-plane and out-of-plane vibrations
as a function of He+ ion fluence are given in Figure 8a. The intensity
of out-of-plane vibrations decreases gradually upon ion irradiation.
While, in-plane vibration intensity improved up to the ion fluence
of 1 × 1017 ions/cm2, subsequently decreased
to the lowest value for highest ion fluence (2 × 1017 ions/cm2). Furthermore, it is apparent from Figure 8b that the intensity
ratio (Eg2/Au2 and Eg2/Ag2) of the vibration
modes increases with He+ ion fluence. This signifies the
hindrance of the out-of-plane vibrations in the ion irradiated Bi2Te3 NRs. A notable feature of the above effect
clearly indicates that the accumulation of defects and lattice disorder
at the surface of NRs (as confirmed by the TEM results) restricted
the longitudinal atom displacements (out-of-plane vibrations). Second,
it has been observed that the shifting of vibration modes toward lower
energies with ion fluence (Figure 8c). This could be ascribed to introduction of strain
due to lattice displacements from its equilibrium position.51,52 Furthermore, the high defect concentration in the ion irradiated
Bi2Te3 pellets relaxes the zone-center phonon
selection rule. Hence, phonons away from the Brillouin zone center
will also contribute the Raman spectra, results broad Raman peak profile
[i.e., full width at half maximum (FWHM)] in all ion irradiated Bi2Te3 samples (Figure 8d).

ratio
of in-plane to out-of-plane vibration mode intensity, (c) peak position
, and (d) FWHM of the peak as a function of ion fluence.

It has been noted that the range of the 100 keV
He+ ion
is lesser than the thickness of the pellet. However, changes in the
carrier concentration, mobility, and TE properties are due to the
consequence of the damages produced by the He+ ion irradiation.
Besides, the contributions from the undamaged regions cannot be neglected.
Hall-effect measurements confirm the p-type conductivity
of the pristine and ion irradiated Bi2Te3 pellets.
As stated above, the p-type conductivity of the Bi2Te3 could be due to of the dominance of singly
ionized acceptor type BiTe antisite defects (formation
energy—0.2 eV) when the synthesis was carried out at Bi excess
conditions.28,53 As shown in Figure 9, the room temperature carrier
concentration and the mobility of the Bi2Te3 pellets are sensitive to the 100 keV He+ ion irradiation.
The carrier concentration of the pristine Bi2Te3 pellet is much lesser and improved sequentially with the ion fluence.
The increase in carrier concentration signifies the infusion of more
number of acceptor type defects (i.e., BiTe antisite defects)
during ion irradiation. This is because of the consistent p-type conduction nature of Bi2Te3 after He+ ion irradiation. On the other hand, the mobility
of the Bi2Te3 improved until the He+ ion fluence of 1 × 1016 ions/cm2. This
is contradicting the fact that the defects, which act as scattering
center will reduce the carrier relaxation time and thus the mobility.
However, the above peculiar behavior of the carrier mobility was reported
previously23 on 3 MeV He2+ ion
irradiated Bi2Te3 thin films. It is proposed
that the grain boundary (i.e., surface conduction) plays a dominant
role in the pristine Bi2Te3. In contrast, the
ion irradiation induces more charge carriers in the bulk. Consequently,
the contribution of the bulk conductivity leads to the improved mobility
values at the intermediate ion fluence. Thereafter, due to the accumulation
of more defects under higher ion fluence, the mobility starts to decrease
accordingly.

Figure 9 Room temperature carrier concentrations and carrier mobility
for
pristine and ion irradiated Bi2Te3 samples for
various ion fluences.

Figure 10a displays
the temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient (S)
of the pristine and ion irradiated Bi2Te3 NRs.
The S of the pristine and irradiated Bi2Te3 exhibited positive values and once again confirms
the p-type conduction. In the case of typical semiconductor,
Seebeck coefficient (S) can be expressed as in eq 3 3  where kB is Boltzmann
constant, T is temperature, e is
charge of the carrier, εf is Fermi energy, Ev is the energy of the top of the valence band
and the factor, q is represented in terms of energy
(ε) dependent carrier relaxation time (τ) as in eq 4 4  

Figure 10 Temperature-dependent
TE transport properties of the pristine and
He+ ion irradiated Bi2Te3 pellets:
(a) Seebeck coefficient, S, (b) electrical conductivity,
σ and (c) power factor, S2σ.

The q factor
values ranged from −0.5 (phonon
dominated scattering process) to 1.5 (ionized impurity dominated scattering
process).54 In our case, it is observed
that the values of S were dropped significantly at
lower ion fluence (i.e., 5 × 1015 ions/cm2) and were subsequently improved at higher ion fluence. The Bi2Te3 pellet irradiated with higher ion fluence (2
× 1017 ions/cm2) exhibited the maximum
value of S (≈184 μV/K) at 390 K which
is 12% higher than that of pristine one (≈162 μV/K).
Pecheur et al.,55 considered the defects
(i.e., antisite and vacancy) as the strong perturbations in the lattice
sites. Therefore, it is apparent that the values of S are significantly influenced by 100 keV He+ ion irradiation
induced defects. This is based on the fact that the subsequent dynamic
annealing of ion-induced Frenkel pairs (i.e., vacancies and interstitials)
would generate the high density of defect clusters particularly at
higher ion fluence, which in turn act as charged Coulomb scattering
centers. It leads to impurity-dominated scattering process. Pan et
al.56 investigated the mechanism of the
ionised impurity scattering process of charge carriers behind the
improvement of the value of S in polycrystalline
AgPbmSnSe2+m samples. Hence, the low-energy charge carriers are extremely scattered
by these charged Coulomb scattering centers (i.e., defects) and leads
to increase in the average carrier energy, resulting in improved S value at the higher ion fluence. However, at lower ion
fluence, the ionised impurity dominant scattering could be inconsiderable.
This could be due to the generation of feeble number of antisite defects
(especially at 5 × 1015 ions/cm2) which
in turn acts as the effective charge carriers (as evident from Hall-effect
measurements). Therefore, it is believed that the lower values of S at 5 × 1015 ions/cm2 could
be ascribed primarily because of its improved carrier concentration.
Furthermore, the emergence of bipolar effect due to the emanation
of opposite type charge carriers deteriorated the value of S significantly at higher temperatures.

As shown in Figure 10b, the temperature-dependent
electrical conductivity (σ) of
the Bi2Te3 improved to a peak value after irradiation
at lower ion fluences (5 × 1015 and 1 × 1016 ions/cm2), then decreases with subsequent ion
fluence. On the basis of the above results, the power factor (S2σ) was calculated and presented in Figure 10c. The maximum
power factor (≈8.2 μW/mK2) was observed for
the Bi2Te3 NR irradiated up to ion fluence of
1 × 1016 ions/cm2.

Additionally,
the effect of ion-induced amorphous surface layer
of the Bi2Te3 NRs (up to 9 nm at 2 × 1017 ions/cm2) on TE transport properties should also
be considered. Because, hopping conduction is activated in the amorphous
materials between the high densities of localized states. This results
in the high values of S and σ and increases
with temperature. However, the hopping conductivity trends were not
observed in nanostructured bulk Si containing nanograins of crystalline
Si (70%) and amorphous SiOx (30%).57 In the present case, the estimated maximum volume
fraction of the amorphous region is around 4% for ion fluence of 2
× 1017 ions/cm2. Thus, the effects of the
amorphous region on the TE transport properties and Raman scattering
experiment are insignificant.

Conclusions
The Bi2Te3 NRs compacted in the form of thin
pellets were irradiated by 100 keV He+ ions to investigate
the modifications on the structural, optical, and TE properties. An
amorphous layer is observed at the surface of the ion irradiated (high
ion fluence) NRs. The accumulation of migrating defect complexes (due
to dynamic annealing process) are the prime cause for the amorphous
layer. Raman scattering experiments provide further insight to the
ion-induced structural modifications by enhancing the in-plane to
out-of-plane atom displacements. Ionized impurity-(i.e., defects)
dominated scattering process significantly enhances the value of S in the irradiated pellets (especially at higher ion fluence).
However, at lower ion fluence, the ionised impurity scattering process
is insignificant. For higher ion fluence, σ has reduced because
of more ionized impurity scatterings and results in low power factor.
The maximum value of σ was obtained for the Bi2Te3 NRs irradiated at 1 × 1016 ions/cm2. Further investigations may result in the possibility of fabricating
the Bi2Te3 NRs as TEG with high power factor.

Experimental
Procedure
Synthesis of Bi2Te3 NRs
Bi2Te3 NRs were synthesized using the surfactant assisted
hydrothermal method described in our previous work.58 In a typical synthesis procedure, bismuth chloride (BiCl3, 99.9%), sodium tellurite (Na2TeO3,
99%) were used as starting materials, while sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 99%) and sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate (SDBS, 98%) were
used as the reducing agent and surfactant respectively. All the chemicals
were of analytical grade and used without further purification.

Na2TeO3 (3 mmol) and 8 mmol of surfactant SDBS
were dissolved in the solution containing BiCl3 (2 mmol)
and NaOH (pH controller). After 2 h continuous stirring, NaBH4 (0.4 g) was added as the reducing agent. Then, the solution
was transferred to the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The
autoclave was sealed and maintained at 150 °C for 24 h. The precipitates
obtained were filtered, washed several times with distilled water
and ethanol. Then the Bi2Te3 precipitate was
dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 4 h. The Bi2Te3 powders were subsequently pressed in the form of rectangular pellets
(dimension: 10 mm × 5 mm × 1 mm) under a pressure of about
10 MPa for 10 min and sintered at 150 °C for 2 h. The pellets
of Bi2Te3 NRs were irradiated with 100 keV He+ ions at room temperature in normal incidence with ion fluences
ranging from 1 × 1016 to 2 × 1017 ions/cm2 using 150 kV ion accelerator facility.

Characterization
Technique
The crystalline phases of
the Bi2Te3 were identified with XRD (Inel, Equinox
2000) by using Cu Kα radiation (1.541 Å). The microstructure
of the pristine Bi2Te3 and the ion-induced structural
modifications were observed by using focused-ion beam FESEM (FIB-FESEM,
Zeiss, cross beam 340) and HRTEM (Zeiss, LIBRA 200FE). The FIB-FESEM
was operated with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV at the working distance
of ≈3.2 mm and the images were recorded using in-lens detector.
The HRTEM was operated with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The
TEM samples were prepared by drop casting the well dispersed Bi2Te3 NRs on the carbon coated TEM copper grids with
the aid of iso-propanol solution. Furthermore, helium ion (100 keV)
irradiation was carried out separately on Bi2Te3 NRs dispersed TEM grids to study the irradiation induced structural
modifications using TEM. The above method is entirely used for TEM
observations over ion milling method in order to avoid the artifacts
produced during the process of TEM sample preparations.

On the
other hand, the evolution of the vibrational modes of the Bi2Te3 pellets under 100 keV He+ ion irradiation
were performed by micro-Raman spectrometer (WITec Alpha RA-300), using
Nd:YAG laser with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and laser power
of 0.5 mW. The relative density of the pristine Bi2Te3 pellet (ρw = 6.72) was performed in water
using the Archimedes principle and the theoretical density (ρt = 7.83) was obtained from the standard XRD JCPDS reference
pattern. The density percentage  of the Bi2Te3 pellet
after the cold pressing and sintering was estimated to be ≈85.7%.
The Hall-effect measurements were carried out under Van der Pauw configuration
using magnetic field of 0.57 T (Ecopia, HMS 5000) at room temperature
to evaluate carrier concentration and mobility of pristine and ion-irradiated
Bi2Te3 pellets. Seebeck coefficient (S) measurements as a function of temperature were carried
out by using the bridge arrangement of two copper bars maintained
at the temperature gradient of 2 K59 under
vacuum. The temperature-dependent electrical conductivity of the Bi2Te3 pellets was measured using a standard four-probe
technique.
