A simple,
one-pot method to fabricate ordered, monodispersed Pd–CeO2 colloidal assembled spheres (CASs) was developed using the
surfactant-mediated solvothermal approach, which involves a tunable
self-assembled process by carefully controlling different chemical
reactions. The evolution process and formation mechanism of the CASs
were thoroughly investigated by time-controlled and component-controlled
experiments. For CO oxidation, this CAS nanocatalyst exhibited much
higher catalytic activity and thermal stability than Pd/CeO2 prepared by an impregnation method, and its complete CO conversion
temperature is ∼120 °C. The enhanced catalytic performance
for CO oxidation could be attributed to the synergistic effect of
highly dispersed PdO species and Pd2+ ions incorporated
into the CeO2 lattice. For this CAS catalyst, each sphere
can be viewed as a single reactor, and its catalytic performance can
be further improved after being supported on alumina, which is obviously
higher than results previously reported. Furthermore, this method
was used to successfully prepare M–CeO2 CASs (M
= Pt, Cu, Mn, Co), showing further that this is a new and ideal approach
for fabricating active and stable ceria-based materials.

1 Introduction
Pd-based catalysts have been intensively researched in recent years
because of their wide applications in various catalytic processes.1−4 For example, Pd-catalyzed carbon–carbon cross-coupling reactions
are the most important and practical reactions in organic chemistry.5,6 Supported PdOx species have been recognized
as the active sites for CH4 combustion, and an application
of Pd-only three-way catalysts represents a meaningful progress for
the removal of pollutants from exhaust gas.7,8 It
is known that the catalytic activity of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) is
closely related to their size, shape, and valence state;9−12 thus it is of great importance to maintain the morphology or physicochemical
states of Pd-active species under various reaction conditions. For
this purpose, Pd NPs are often loaded on supports, such as metal oxides,
zeolites, carbon materials, and so forth. Among these kinds of supports,
cerium oxide is considered as a unique one because of its oxygen storage/release
capacity and its redox capability to influence the chemical and electronic
states of Pd species.13

Pd/CeO2 has been widely
researched and used in various catalytic reactions, such as three-way
catalytic exhaust gas purification, volatile organic compound (VOC)
elimination, selective hydrogenations, and photocatalytic reactions.14−19 In recent years, with the help of advanced nanomaterial synthesis
technology, it is now possible to purposefully design Pd–CeO2 hybrid nanocatalysts with unique features and further improve
their functionality.20−24 For instance, Cargnello et al. designed and prepared a Pd@CeO2-type catalyst by means of the concepts of supramolecular
chemistry and showed an exceptional activity and stability in methane
combustion.25−27 Zhang et al. explored a clean synthesis of high-quality
Pd@CeO2 nanospheres by salting-out-assisted growth and
self-assembly, which improved their catalytic activity for CO oxidation.28 They recently also fabricated a Pd@CeO2 hybrid structure with tunable Pd core sizes with a simple two-step
biomolecular-assisted process without any expensive or toxic ligand.29 We have synthesized a hollow-structured core–shell-like
Pd–CeO2 nanocomposite by the hard-template method,
which exhibited enhanced catalytic activities for CO oxidation and
selective reduction of 4-nitrophenol. The Pd particles can be well
protected by the CeO2 shell, and the catalytic stability
could be well maintained even after calcination at 700 °C.30

Although many gratifying achievements
have been made, there are
still some challenges remaining. In Cargnello’s protocol, multiple
procedures are needed to obtain the hybrid structures, which is time
consuming, inevitably. Besides, large amounts of toxic organic solvents
and surfactants are required during the assembly processes. In Zhang’s
process, the size of Pd NPs is relatively large (>8 nm); thus,
the
utilization of the Pd element is not efficient enough. Therefore,
it is still necessary to develop simple and green methods for preparing
highly active Pd–CeO2 hybrid nanocatalysts with
more efficient Pd utilization.

With the help of the hands-on
experience of researchers, the key
factors for successfully synthesizing novel Pd–CeO2 hybrid structures include the manipulation of individual chemical
reactions rates, especially tuning interfacial chemical processes
among different components. In this paper, we developed a one-pot,
surfactant-assisted solvothermal method to prepare Pd–CeO2 colloidal assembled spheres (CASs). The Pd clusters were
dispersively distributed in CeO2 CASs by a one-pot method,
which is more efficient than some of the two-step processes to prepare
noble-metal/oxide nanospheres.31,32 The results showed
that the Pd–CeO2 CAS superstructure exhibited an
enhanced catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared with a conventional
Pd/CeO2-supported catalyst. Moreover, this method can be
easily extended to the synthesis of Pt–CeO2 CASs
and transition metal-incorporated CeO2 CASs.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Sample Synthesis
Pd–CeO2 CASs
CeCl3·7H2O was dissolved
in ethylene glycol (6 g CeCl3·7H2O per
100 mL of solvent) under stirring for 2 h. CeCl3·7H2O ethylene glycol solution (10 mL) and
30 mL ethylene glycol were added into a 250 mL flask under stirring
at room temperature. Then a certain amount of
K2PdCl4 was added under intensive stirring for
30 min, followed by adding 0.1 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), 2
mL of acetic acid, 0.5 mL of tetramethylammounium hydroxide (N(CH3)4OH, 25% in H2O), and 0.4 mL of concentrated
ammonia hydroxide (25–28% in H2O), forming a transparent
light-brown solution. This solution was immersed in an oil bath, and
the temperature was increased up to 130 °C; a grayish suspension
solution was obtained after 15 h of the reaction.

After the
reaction was completed and cooled down to room temperature, this mixture
was diluted with 40 mL of acetone and then centrifuged at 4500 rpm
for 15 min. The resulted solid was dispersed in the mixed solution
of acetone and ethanol (v/v = 1:1), followed by centrifugation twice
at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The obtained product was dried at 60 °C
overnight and calcined at 600 °C for 2 h.

Pd–CeO2 CAS Supported on γ-Al2O3
A certain amount of γ-Al2O3 was dispersed
in 50 mL of deionized water under ultrasonication
for 10 min. A calcined Pd–CeO2 CAS suspension (20
mL, 2.5 mg/mL) was slowly added into the Al2O3 solution under stirring at room temperature for 1 h. The product
was gathered by centrifugation and dried at 80 °C overnight.

Pd/CeO2-Imp Catalyst
The conventional Pd/CeO2 catalyst was prepared by the impregnation method with PdCl2 as the precursor. The collected powder was dried at 80 °C
and calcined at 600 °C for 2 h.

Pt–CeO2 CASs
K2PtCl4 was used as a precursor
instead of K2PdCl4. The preparation reaction
was conducted at 140 °C for
20 h, and other processes were the same as those of Pd–CeO2 CASs.

Transition Metal (M = Cu, Co, Mn)–CeO2 CASs
(M–CeO2 CASs)
CuCl2, CoCl2, and Mn(CH3COO)2 were used as precursors
with a molar ratio of 1:9 (transition metal: Ce), and the synthesis
processes were the same as those of Pd–CeO2 CASs
except the addition of PVP. For the Mn–CeO2 CAS
sample, the reaction time was prolonged to 24 h.

2.2 Catalytic Activity Testing
The catalytic
performances of samples for CO oxidation were evaluated in a fixed-bed
reactor. For a typical testing, the Pd–CeO2 catalyst
diluted with silica was loaded in a quartz-tube reactor. Then, the
feed gas containing 1 vol % CO, 20 vol % O2, and balance
N2 was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 50
mL/min. After the sample was pretreated in 10 vol % O2/N2 at 150 °C for 30 min, the temperature of the reactor
was raised at a rate of 2 °C/min from room temperature. The gas
composition was monitored online using a GC (GC 2060 system) with
a flame ionization detector (FID) and methane converter. The conversion
of CO was calculated on the basis of the change of CO concentrations
in the inlet and outlet gases.

Kinetic experiments were
performed at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 100 000
or 150 000 mL/(gcat·h). Typical conversions
of CO were kept well below 10% so that the differential conditions
could be assumed.

The stability testing was performed under
a cycling experiment.
Before the testing, the catalyst was pretreated in the feed gas at
600 °C for 30 min and then cooled down to 85 °C to test
the conversion of CO to CO2. The cycle was repeated three
times.

Turnover frequency (TOF) measurements were conducted
at 60 °C
at a GHSV of 100 000 mL/(gcat·h). The CO conversion
was obtained after 20 min of the CO reaction, and the TOF was calculated
based on the equation , where XCO is
the CO conversion, VCO is the gas flow
of CO (mol/s), NA is the Avogadro constant,
and N is the number of the catalytic sites (N = Nt·DPd, where Nt is the total
amount of Pd atom in the catalyst and DPd is the Pd dispersion).

2.3 Characterization of Samples
Elemental
analysis of the sample was done by inductively coupled-plasma atomic
emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) on a Varian 710ES instrument (Varian
Co. Palo Alto, US). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded
on a PANalytical PW 3040/60 X’Pert Pro powder diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation, which was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA
and a scanning speed of 0.5°/min. N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms of samples were measured at −196 °C on a micromeritics
ASAP 2020 instrument, and the surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method. The Pd dispersion in the catalysts was calculated by
the CO chemisorption method on AutoChem II 2920 chemical adsorption
equipment at room temperature.

H2 temperature-programmed
reduction (H2-TPR) was carried on a PX200 apparatus (Tianjin
Pengxiang Technology Co. Ltd.) with a thermal conductivity detector
(TCD). The catalyst (40 mg) was used, and the reduction gas consisted
of 5% H2/N2 with a flow rate of 40 mL/min. TPR
was run from room temperature to 800 °C at 10 °C/min.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a JEM-2100
transmission electron microscope. The sample was ultrasonically suspended
in the ethanol solvent, and one or two drops of this slurry were deposited
on a copper grid. The liquid phase was evaporated before the grid
was loaded into the microscope.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectra of samples were
obtained on a Kratos Axis Ultra-DLD photoelectron spectrometer equipped
with Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation as the excitation source. All
binding energies (BEs) were determined with respect to the C1s line
(284.8 eV) originating from adventitious carbon.

The size distribution
of spheres was measured by photon correlation
spectroscopy on a Zetasizer instrument (Malvern Instruments Ltd.)
at room temperature. The suspension was prepared with a concentration
of 0.5 mg/mL followed by ultrasonication for 15 min.

3 Results and Discussion
The Pd–CeO2 CASs were synthesized in a simple
one-pot fashion by the modified solvothermal method. As shown in TEM
images (Figure 1a,b)
and size distribution profiles (Figure S1), the as-synthesized Pd–CeO2 CASs are well monodispersed,
and their average size is 100–120 nm. The as-synthesized hybrid
spheres are composed mainly of small 2–3 nm CeO2 nanocrystals, which is consistent with the XRD results (Figure 1g). However, the
dense stacking of CeO2 nanocrystals makes it difficult
to discern the distribution of Pd species in the spheres, so high-angle
annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM)
was used to illustrate the mappings of Pd, Ce, and O components in
the CAS. As shown in Figure 1f, Pd is randomly scattered in the entire colloidal sphere,
which is different from some results reported.28,29 After calcination at 600 °C to completely remove organic residues,
the morphology of spheres remains unchanged and the size of the spheres
obviously shrinks, and their most probable diameter decreases from
110 to 80 nm (Figure S1). Also, the CeO2 size increases a bit (Figure 1c), and its XRD peaks strengthened to some extent (Figure 1g). In the HRTEM
micrograph of calcined Pd–CeO2 CASs (Figure 1d), the lattice fringes with
an interplanar spacing of 0.31 nm is associated with the (111) facet
of CeO2 NPs, and the obvious lattice discontinuities can
be observed, which characterizes further the nanosized CeO2 and the possible lattice strain. Figure 1e is the magnified picture of a single sphere
and well demonstrates that ultrasmall Pd clusters (indicated by white
arrows) are embedded in the assembled CeO2 NPs, resulting
in a strong interaction between Pd clusters and CeO2 NPs.

mapping of Pd–CeO2 CASs, and (g) XRD profiles of
the as-prepared and calcined Pd–CeO2 CASs.

To further confirm the close interaction
between Pd and CeO2 components, XPS was applied to investigate
the valence state
of Ce and Pd. As shown in Figure 2A, the peaks at BEs of 336.8 and 337.9 eV can be attributed
to the dispersed PdO clusters and the Pd–O–Ce structure,
respectively, which clearly demonstrated that the Pd species in the
Pd–CeO2 CASs interacted closely with CeO2 nanocrystals. The Ce 3d XPS spectra in Figure 2B showed a valence variation before and after
calcination. The as-prepared sample possesses more Ce3+ species that is caused by ethylene glycol during the synthesis,
and after thermal treatment, the oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ obviously occurred, indicating a thermal-induced crystallization
process.

Pd–CeO2 CASs at 600 °C.

The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the
as-synthesized
Pd–CeO2 CASs before and after calcination at 600
°C are shown in Figure 3. In the low relative pressure region, the curves reflect
a microporous structure, which may be caused by the stacking of nanocrystals
that assembled the spheres. A hysteresis, typical of type IV, appeared
in the high relative pressure region, indicating a relatively large
pore structure, which is likely caused by the stacking of spheres.
The surface area of the sample before and after being calcined at
600 °C is 89 and 80 m2/g, respectively, which is larger
than that of the core–shell Pt/Pd@CeO2 spheres reported.28,33

and calcined Pd–CeO2 CASs at 600 °C.

The formation mechanism of Pd–CeO2 CASs can be
discussed in detail based on the time-controlled experiments. Followed
by the visual variation of the reaction system, the formation process
undergoes three stages, that is, the nucleation of Pd clusters, formation
of CeO2 nanocrystals, and self-assembly of these two components.

First, the brown transparent solution gradually turned black after
20–30 min of the reaction when the temperature ramped up to
130 °C, indicating the possible formation of Pd clusters in the
solution. To verify this assumption, we characterized the solid sample
formed for 1.5 h. As shown in Figure 4, the sheetlike structure and ultrasmall Pd clusters
coexisted in the sample, but no lattice fringes can be observed. Also,
the elemental analysis shows that this sample is consisted of C, H,
O, N, Ce, and Pd elements (Table S1). The
XRD results (Figure 4f) show that it is a Ce–glycolate-like inorganic–organic
network structure and was caused by the Ce ions interacted with acetic
acid and ethylene glycol at 130 °C. The FT-IR spectrum (Figure S2) also confirmed that the Ce ions have
bonded with ethylene glycol and acetic acid on the basis of the typical
IR absorption peaks at 1562 cm–1 ν(OCO), 2942,
and 2895 cm–1 ν(C–H) C2H4.34

formed for (a) 1.5 h, (b–d) 10
h ((c) primary Pd–CeO2 CAS and (d) CeO2 nuclei), (e) 15 h, and (f) their XRD patterns.

With the increase in the synthesis time, the hydrolysis of
Ce species
was gradually promoted, and the subsequent self-assembly of nucleated
CeO2 nanocrystals formed the primary spheres (Figure 4b–d). After
10 h of the synthesis reaction, the black transparent solution gradually
became blurred, indicating the initial formation of the CeO2 structure. As shown in Figure 4c,d, the primary CAS and CeO2 nuclei can
coexist simultaneously. Finally, the Pd clusters and CeO2 nanocystals coassembled into the Pd–CeO2 hybrid
structure (Figure 4e). The XRD patterns in Figure 4f can well reflect the structure change of different
intermediate compounds formed in the fabrication process of Pd–CeO2 CASs.

To obtain a highly dispersible Pd–CeO2 hybrid
structure in a one-pot fashion, the key is to tune the reaction rates
for different chemical processes; that is, the balance between the
slow hydrolysis of the Ce precursor, Pd-cluster formation, and self-assembled
process should be critically controlled, which can be well achieved
with the help of surfactants and cosolvents. To clarify the effect
of each reagent on the synthetic results, we also designed a series
of component-controlled experiments.(1) We tested the essential role of ammonia
hydroxide, acetic acid, and N(CH3)4OH in the
synthesis of Pd–CeO2 CASs. When metal salt precursors
were added in the solution including acetic acid and N(CH3)4OH but without ammonia hydroxide, the obtained synthesis
solution was transparent black after 15 h, and only the reduction
of Pd2+ to Pd0 occurred and no assembled CeO2 nanocrystal spheres formed. This was verified by the typical
Pd peaks in the XRD pattern of the obtained product (Figure S3).

(2) When the amount of NH3·H2O was increased
2-fold up to 0.8 mL, the solution immediately
became opaque at 70–80 °C, indicating that a large amount
of CeO2 crystals formed very quickly and its nucleation
could not be controlled. The obtained spheres would severely conjugate
one another, and the bulklike structure formation was inevitable (TEM
image shown in Figure S4). These phenomena
confirmed the inevitable role of an appropriate amount of NH3·H2O, which functions as a pH regulator and affects
the hydrolysis rate of Ce ions.

(3) Although NH3·H2O is indispensable in
the successful fabrication of Pd–CeO2 CASs, its
role can be played only in the presence of acetic
acid. Without the addition of this organic acid, the produced Pd particles
would aggregate, and CeO2 nanocrystals could not be well
self-assembled into spheres (TEM image shown in Figure S5). It was reported recently that appropriate amounts
of formic acid and ammonia hydroxide could be used as a formic acid/ammonium
formate buffer solution to effectively control the OH– concentration.35 We consider that the
acetic acid/ammonium acetate plays the similar role in the fabrication
of Pd–CeO2 CASs by tuning the reaction process.

(4) N(CH3)4OH was
commonly used as a pH regulator as well as a dispersing agent in the
synthetic process, which was reported in the synthesis of aqueous
dispersible CeO2 NPs.36 PVP
helps to stabilize Pd clusters against aggregation. If PVP was not
added, the black precipitate would be formed and stuck at the flask
bottom when the synthesis reaction occurred at 130 °C for a short
time.



On the basis of the above results,
each reagent is necessary and
its dosage needs to be carefully controlled or balanced to obtain
the dispersible Pd–CeO2 CASs. To our knowledge,
it is difficult to design and prepare noble metal- or transition metal-incorporated
CeO2 hybrid nanospheres by a universal method. However,
we luckily found that the present approach of structural design could
be well used to synthesize other CAS architectures. For example, platinum
and some common transition metals (Cu, Mn, and Co) can be easily introduced
into CeO2 CASs by slight changes of experimental conditions.
As shown in Figure 5, the diameter of the as-prepared Pt–CeO2 CASs
is nearly the same as that of Pd–CeO2 CASs, and
they are mainly composed of ultrasmall CeO2 nanocrystallites,
and no Pt NPs can be observed. The XPS analysis indicates that the
Pt species existed in an ionic state (Figure S6), confirming the highly dispersed Pt species in Pt–CeO2 CASs. For transition metal-incorporated M–CeO2 CASs (M = Cu, Co, Mn), their sphere diameters are less than
50 nm, and their XRD profiles showed only the characteristic diffraction
peaks of the fluorite CeO2 structure (Figure S7), which indicates that the successful incorporation
into the CASs. Their transition metal contents were measured by the
EDS analysis (Figure S8), and Cu/Ce (at
%) = 9.5, Co/Ce = 4.2, and Mn/Ce = 6.5.

(a) Pt–CeO2 CASs,

and (d) Mn–CeO2 CASs.

To investigate the catalytic performance of the Pd–CeO2 CAS material, the CO catalytic oxidation was used as the
model reaction. For comparison, we tested the catalytic activities
of the Pd/CeO2-imp sample prepared by the impregnation
method and pure CeO2 for CO oxidation. As shown in Figure 6A, Pd–CeO2 CASs exhibited the best catalytic activity, and the temperature
(T100) of 100% CO conversion is around
125 °C, which is much lower than that of the Pd/CeO2-imp catalyst (190 °C). T10, T50, and T90 (the
reaction temperatures of 10, 50, and 90% CO conversions) were shown
in Table 1. Besides,
the Pd–CeO2 CASs also showed a good thermal stability
after the cycling testing 3 times at 600 and 85 °C (Figure 6B). A decline of
2–3% CO conversion can be observed, which can be explained
by the minor accumulation of carbonate species on the catalyst surface.37,38 The TEM image (Figure S9) showed that
the morphology of Pd–CeO2 CASs was well maintained
and no agglomeration occurred after the cycling testing 3 times. A
recent study on similar the Pd@CeO2 nanostructure showed
that at medium-high temperature and an oxidizing atmosphere cerium
could be quite volatile and some new structural features would appear,
including highly dispersed SiO2–CeOx species and rather bigger CeO2 particles.39 Therefore, after the relatively long time utilization
of Pd–CeO2 CASs in the cycling experiment at 600
°C, we cannot neglect their possible structural change, although
the morphology of Pd–CeO2 CASs could be well maintained.
Also, further detailed characterization and analysis are needed.

The kinetic data of CO oxidation on Pd–CeO2 CASs
and Pd/CeO2-imp are shown in Figure 6C. The results showed that the Pd–CeO2 CASs exhibited much higher catalytic activity (or much higher
reaction rate) than the Pd/CeO2-imp catalyst. Also, the
apparent activation energy (Ea) of the
Pd–CeO2 CAS catalyst was 44 kJ/mol, which is much
lower than that (Ea = 75 kJ/mol) of the
Pd/CeO2-imp catalyst. We have further calculated the TOF
at 60 °C; the TOF of the Pd/CeO2-imp catalyst is ∼0.026
s–1, and the TOF of Pd–CeO2 CASs
is ∼0.051 s–1 (Table 1), which also confirmed that the Pd–CeO2 CAS nanocatalyst possessed higher catalytic activity than
the Pd/CeO2-imp catalyst for CO oxidation under the same
reaction condition. Furthermore, we listed TOFs of reported Pd–CeO2 catalysts at certain temperatures for CO oxidation in Table 2, and the results
show that the catalytic activity of Pd–CeO2 CASs
is higher than that reported.

To investigate and compare the differences of reducibility
and
an interaction of Pd species with CeO2 between the Pd–CeO2 CASs and Pd/CeO2-imp catalyst, H2-TPR
was used to test these two catalysts, and the results are shown in Figure 7. In the two TPR
profiles, there are two peaks at below 200 °C, but their intensities
and positions are different. We may attribute the first peak at below
200 °C to the reduction of PdO species and the second to the
reduction of the Pd2+–O–Ce4+ linkage
structure.37,40 The calculated H2 consumption
of the first peak in Pd/CeO2-imp at 60 °C is ∼104
μmol/g and is close to the theoretical value (88 μmol/g)
for PdO reduction to metallic Pd. For Pd–CeO2 CASs,
the H2 consumption of the first peak is much lower than
its theoretical value. This is because of the fact that in the Pd/CeO2-imp sample the Pd species existed mostly in a form of PdO
by the impregnation process with few Pd2+ incorporated
into the CeO2 support; in the Pd–CeO2 CAS sample,
most Pd species formed a solid solution with CeO2 nanocrystallites
produced during the solvothermal process. Moreover, we can observe
a very small negative peak in the TPR curves of two samples (∼60
°C for Pd–CeO2 CASs and ∼80 °C
for Pd/CeO2-imp), which could be attributed to the decomposition
of PdHx species.

Figure 7 H2-TPR profiles
of 1.1 wt % Pd–CeO2 CASs and 1 wt % Pd/CeO2-imp.

In the reduction peaks at <200
°C, the total H2 consumption of Pd/CeO2-imp and Pd–CeO2 CASs is ∼211 and 427 μmol/g,
respectively, which are
higher than that when reducing PdO to Pd. Thus, it is inevitable that
the reduction peak may contain simultaneous reduction of Ce4+ ions near Pd species. This is because that the presence of noble
metals can promote the reduction of metal oxides by the H2 spillover from the metal to the oxide support, as well as the increase
of oxygen vacancies on the ceria support. With more Pd2+ ions incorporated into the CeO2 nanocrystals in the synthesis
process, the Pd–CeO2 CASs possessed more oxygen
vacancy defects; thus, more Ce4+ can be easily reduced
at lower temperatures.

For the reduction peak at 320–370
°C, it should be
attributed to the reduction of surface lattice oxygen. In the Pd–CeO2 CAS catalyst, because the Pd2+–O–Ce4+ linkage structure (Pd2+ incorporated into CeO2) existed besides highly dispersed PdO clusters, part of surface
lattice oxygen was reduced at <200 °C, which was promoted
by the reduction of Pd2+ ions, resulting in the decrease
in the peak area at 324 °C. The reduction peak at >700 °C
is ascribed to the reduction of bulk CeO2 and affected
by the CeO2 particle size. The average particle size of
CeO2 is 5–6 nm for Pd–CeO2 CASs,
and for the Pd/CeO2-imp catalyst, the particle size of
its commercial nanosized CeO2 powder is over 20 nm. This
leads to a distinguishing difference in their H2-TPR profiles.
With the decrease of the CeO2 particle size, more surface
oxygen existed in the Pd–CeO2 CASs, so the reduction
of bulk CeO2 decreased obviously.46

As shown in the characterization results above for the Pd–CeO2 CAS catalyst, the active Pd species existed mainly in highly
dispersed PdO clusters and Pd2+ incorporated into CeO2 (Pd2+–O–Ce4+ linkage
structure), which act the active sites for CO oxidation. In this Pd–CeO2 CAS hybrid spheres, the enhanced catalytic activity can be
attributed to the synergetic effect provided by two aspects: the surface
dispersed PdO clusters are more active for CO adsorption, and the
Pd2+ ions incorporated into the CeO2 lattice
creates more oxygen vacancies, which are beneficial to oxygen activation
in CO oxidation. For the Pd/CeO2-imp catalyst, the O2 activation might be weaker than that for the Pd–CeO2 CAS catalyst because of the lack of oxygen vacancies on the
surface, resulting in its lower catalytic activity for CO oxidation.

One of the advantages of ordered hybrid nanocatalysts is that every
independent unit can be viewed as an individual active reactor in
the catalytic reaction, and it is helpful to load these nanocatalysts
on high-surface area supports to further improve the overall catalytic
performance.26,29 Hence, we prepared the Pd–CeO2 CAS/Al2O3 by a simple process (seen
in the Experimental Section). The results
showed that Pd–CeO2 CAS particles could be uniformly
supported on the Al2O3 carrier (TEM image, Figure S10). The BET surface area (144 m2/g) of Pd–CeO2 CAS/Al2O3 is higher than that (80 m2/g) of the unsupported one,
and their N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms are shown
in Figure S11. After Pd–CeO2 CASs were supported, their dispersion was improved, resulting
in an increase in their catalytic performance (Figure 6D). Besides, this procedure was also applied
to fabricate the Pt–CeO2 CAS/Al2O3 sample; as shown in Figure S12, CO was completely converted to CO2 over this Pt catalyst
at 115 °C, which has a higher catalytic activity than those reported
for the Pt catalysts for CO oxidation.33,47,48

4 Conclusions
In summary,
we have developed a facile one-pot method to successfully
synthesize Pd–CeO2 CASs, in which ultrasmall Pd
clusters are embedded in the CeO2 colloidal assembly. The
synthesis process involves careful control of Pd-cluster formation,
the Ce3+ hydrolysis rate, and the subsequent assembly process.
Each surfactant/cosolvent is necessary for the successful fabrication
of this material. For CO oxidation, this Pd–CeO2 CAS sample shows a much higher catalytic activity compared with
the Pd/CeO2 catalyst prepared by the impregnation method.
The enhanced catalytic activity can be attributed to the maximized
Pd–CeO2 interface of this ordered hybrid spheres.
Moreover, after the Pd–CeO2 CAS sample
was simply supported on alumina, its overall catalytic performance
can be further improved, for instance, the temperature of the CO complete
conversion was only around 90 °C. Because this Pd–CeO2 CAS also exhibit a relatively high thermal stability, it
can potentially be valuable for other hydrocarbon abatement processes,
such as methane or propane combustion. The successful synthesis of
M–CeO2 CASs (M = Pt, Cu, Mn, Co) shows further that
this method is a new and ideal approach for fabricating active and
stable ceria-based materials.
