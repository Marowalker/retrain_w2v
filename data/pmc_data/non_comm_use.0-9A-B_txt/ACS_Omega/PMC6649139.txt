Spent
hens, a poultry by-product, have little economic value for
processing and mostly end up in landfills. However, there are concerns
over disposal of spent hens; therefore, it is pertinent to find out
alternative uses that are environmentally sound. On the other hand,
single-use plastic packaging is leading to a global environmental
crisis. In this study, proteins were extracted from spent hen, plasticized,
and processed into films by compression molding. The hybrid bionanocomposite
films were successfully prepared using glycerol as a plasticizer,
chitosan as a cross-linker, and varying concentrations of nanoclay
as a nanoreinforcement. The effects of nanoreinforcements, plasticization,
and cross-linking were then evaluated on thermal, mechanical, and
barrier properties of the prepared bionanocomposite films. Various
concentrations of nanoclay and chitosan were dispersed in the protein
matrix. However, with the same plasticizer loading, the optimum addition
of chitosan and nanoclay led to almost twofold increase in the mechanical
strength, compared to neat protein films. The results indicated that
at optimal conditions, a good intercalation and/or exfoliation of
the protein biopolymers into clay interlayer galleries was observed
leading to improved thermal, thermomechanical, and barrier properties.
These hybrid bionanocomposite films have great future potential to
be used in packaging and other applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Currently,
global annual production of plastics is over 300 million
tons with an annual growth rate of about 5%. Crude oil resources are
the main source of plastic production.1 Packaging is the third largest plastic application sector around
the globe and represents 2% of GDP in the developed world. Worldwide,
there was 31% increase in total municipal waste from 1988–2005,
and packaging was a major (37%) contributor.2 Presently, the plastic market is growing rapidly with an annual
growth rate of 30%.3 Food packaging is
the most significant application of packaging, contributing almost
2/3 of a total packaging waste.4 In the
present linear plastic economy, 90% of products is single-used and
discarded, leading to a major source of plastic litter.5 The extensive use of nondegradable synthetic
plastics for packaging is leading to concerns for the environmental
security and sustainability. The excessive reliance on petroleum-based
packaging materials can be eased by bioplastic expansion using sustainable
and renewable resources.6

Bioplastics
represent a wide spectrum of thermoplastic materials
which are obtained from biological resources or combination of both
biological and fossil fuel resources. Many studies are currently being
carried out to make new monomers from biological resources either
by industrial biotechnology or by chemical processes. Recently, various
reports have been published on utilization of waste proteins for applications
in packaging, aerospace, sports, automotive, and construction industry.7−10 Kaur et al. 2018 synthesized nanoreinforced green bionanomaterials
from chicken feather keratin proteins and suggested for multiple commercial
applications.10 Another study is reported
by de Oliveira and co-workers in 2019 prepared biopolymer films from
a by-product of cheese industry. That is, whey protein isolates as
a smart packaging to prevent the changes in conductivity of the food.10

The development of bio-based food packaging
is driven by biodegradability,
renewability, and low carbon footprint6 because majority of the bio-based food packaging can be degraded
or composted completely into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water
(H2O).11,12

Unfortunately, the plastics
prepared from neat biopolymer have
downsides such as poor mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties
as compared to conventional petro-plastics. Because of this, several
efforts have been made to enhance the properties of the biopolymers.
Exploitation of nanotechnology, incorporation of nanostructures into
biopolymers, has great potential to address these challenges and to
improve mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties of biopolymers.13−18 The integration of nanofillers such as silicate, clay, zinc oxide
(ZnO), silver, copper, gold, and titanium dioxide (TiO2) in biopolymers has been reported not only to improve mechanical
and barrier properties but also to impart other functions such as
antimicrobial, biosensing, and oxygen scavenging properties.14,19,20

For the production of bio-based
plastic materials, the use of biopolymers
from industrial by-products is highly desirable because it not only
reduces utilization of food grade protein biopolymers such as wheat
and corn but also diverts waste from landfills. One such potential
source of proteins is spent laying hens which are mostly disposed.
Because of low yield and poor quality, the meat products made from
spent hen are not able to compete with broiler meat and therefore
no longer economically viable. The current disposal methods for spent
hen such as burying, compositing, and incineration are often both
environmentally and economically unfavorable. Therefore, alternatives
uses of spent hens are needed to be explored.21,22

In Canada, approximately 26 million egg-laying hens are produced
yearly.23 Each spent hen has
∼1.8 kg meat, and on average, the whole carcass contains about
17% proteins, which represents about 8–10 kilotons of proteins
only in Canada. Herein, we report an integrated approach to harvest
proteins from whole spent birds and develop bionanocomposite materials
using nanoclay as reinforcement. Nanoclays are considered one of the
most affordable nanofillers and are well known to enhance properties
of polymeric materials if dispersed effectively. The properties of
the developed bionanocomposite materials were investigated in detail.
To the best of our knowledge, no report on the development of bionanocomposite
packaging films from spent hen proteins is available in the literature.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Proteins’ Purity
and Recovery
The high recovery of proteins is not only important
from an economic
stand point but also to determine the efficiency of the extraction
method. The protein recovery achieved by alkali-aided method mainly
depends on three factors: the solubility of protein at a high pH,
sediments size after centrifugation, and the solubility at the isoelectric
point.24 The alkali-aided method has been
used for fish muscles, chicken residue, and mechanically separated
turkey meat. However, in this study, we used this method with slight
modification for the whole spent hen to extract the proteins. Higher
alkaline pH was considered for the current study. Studies have shown
that protein’s solubility at higher pH has been attributed
to increased net negative charges on protein chains, leading to electrostatic
repulsion between the chains. At isoelectric point, protein molecule
carries no net electrical charge; therefore, charged groups are least
available for interactions with water molecules, and further exposure
of nonpolar/hydrophobic amino acids may cause increased precipitation
because of thermodynamically unfavorable interaction between water
and nonpolar groups ultimately leading to higher protein recovery.25 The same phenomenon is observed here.

The high protein recovery was contributed by the increased solubilization
at higher pH (12) and later precipitation at 5.75 pH. The protein
recovery yield and purity with our method was 74 and 96%, respectively,
which is quite higher in comparison to protein extraction available
in the literature. Omana et al.26 reported
the protein recovery yield of ∼66% with final protein contents
of 19.6% from turkey meat. Recently, functional proteins were extracted
from the bovine and porcine hearts using acid or alkali solubilization
and isoelectric precipitation. They reported the protein recovery
between 51.53 and 55.74%.27

2.2 Mechanical Strength
Stress–strain
curves are commonly used to study the mechanical properties of polymers.
The tensile strength and elongation at break are typically examined
properties to determine the polymer applications. The materials having
tensile strength lower than 5 MPa and elongation more than 100% are
considered as a rubbery material. On the other hand, glassy materials
have tensile strength more than 30 MPa and no elongation.28 Commonly, thermoplastic materials which are
used for packaging purposes having tensile strength up to 10 MPa and
elongation at break around 1000% such as low density polyethylene29 and polybutylene succinate30 derived packaging materials. The neat protein films without
plasticizer were too brittle to perform tensile tests. Therefore,
a number of plasticizers were used to achieve the required thermoplastic
behavior of the proteins derived films. Glycerol was found to be the
most suitable and compatible plasticizer among sorbitol, ethylene
glycol, poly(ethylene)glycol, and butanediol.

The nanoclay concentrations
(1, 3, 5, and 8%) were used to find out its optimum percentage to
obtain maximum mechanical strength. The films containing 5% nanoclay
displayed better mechanical properties compared to the films prepared
with other concentrations of nanoclay (1, 3, and 8%), the mechanical
properties of these films are given in the Supporting Information (Table S1). The films with better tensile strength
were considered for further characterization, and understanding the
effect of the clay on spent hen derived proteins material. The blends
were denoted as PG1 (proteins with 20% glycerol), PG2 (proteins with
25% glycerol), PGC1 (proteins with 20% glycerol and 3% chitosan),
PGCB1 (proteins with 20% glycerol, 3% chitosan, and 5% nanoclay),
PGC2 (proteins with 25% glycerol and 3% chitosan), and PGCB2 (proteins
with 25% glycerol, 3% chitosan, and 5% nanoclay). In all above-mentioned
blends, moisture was kept constant which was 10%.

The stress–strain
curves of the resulting films are presented
in Figure 1, and values
are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 shows the
stress–strain curves of films with glycerol, glycerol/chitosan,
and glycerol/chitosan/nanoclay. The results revealed an increment
in mechanical properties by the addition of 3% chitosan. Further,
by addition of 5% nanoclay, a remarkable enhancement in mechanical
strength was observed (11.37 MPa). From Table 1, it can be clearly seen that films prepared
using 25% glycerol with 3% chitosan have maximum elongation, that
is, 1590%. The plasticizer usually increases the flexibility and extensibility
of the material. Further the addition of chitosan improved the mechanical
strength of the films probably because of ionic interactions between
chitosan and protein chains, chitosan’s film-forming ability,
and H-bond network formation in the solid state.31,32

Furthermore, by the addition of nanoclay, the tensile strength
of the films was improved and extension decreased. This could be due
to hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions between the nanoclay,
protein, and chitosan, leading to improvement in the mechanical strength
of protein/chitosan/nanoclay hybrid films.33 As evident, the maximum improvement in tensile strength is at the
addition level of 5% clay most likely because of the enhanced interactions’
among components of films as described above and still relatively
homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles compared to higher concentration
of nanoclay as confirmed from the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images. The well-dispersed nanoparticles enhance the strength
as reported by other researchers in the case of layered particles.34

2.3 Structural Analysis
Fourier transform
infrared attenuated total reflection (FTIR ATR) was used to understand
the structure of pure proteins, clay, and prepared films, as shown
in Figure 2a,b. All
of the films and pure proteins show characteristics absorption bands
of polypeptide as amide A, amide I, amide II, and amide III.35−37 The absorption band at 3277 cm–1 is ascribed to
the stretching vibrations of O–H and N–H (amide A),
whereas the band at 2932 cm–1 is related to the
symmetrical C–H stretching vibrations.38 The strong absorption band at 1633 cm–1 is assigned
to the C=O stretching with minor contribution from C–N
stretching (amide I), providing information related to proteins’
secondary structure.

Figure 2 (a) ATR–FTIR spectra of pure proteins (P) and clay
(b),
ATR–FTIR spectra of PGC1, PGCB1, PGC2, and PGCB2.

The amide II region is related to the 1538 cm–1 absorption band because of N–H bending and
C–H stretches.
A weak band at 1234 cm–1 is assigned to the amide
III, which is the combination of C–N stretching and N–H
in plane bending along with the influence from C–C stretching
and C=O bending vibration.39 These
three bands give evidence about the protein conformation and backbone
structure. Literature suggested that the peak at 3277 cm–1 (amide I) is due to the α-helix structure; the range of 1539–1515
cm–1 (amide II) is attributed to the β-sheet
structure.40,41 Therefore, all of the derived
films possess two microstructures of α-helix and β-sheet.

From Figure 2a,
a clear change can be seen in intensity and position of absorption
signals around 3200, 2950, 1627, and 1525 cm–1 in
bionanocomposites as compared to pure proteins. The shift in peak
position with change in intensities shows the interaction between
proteins and clay. Particularly, there is a significant increase in
intensity around 3200 cm–1, assigned to OH stretching
vibrations, which may be attributed to the presence of more hydrogen
bonds between layers of clay and proteins in composites. The band
around 1000 cm–1 can be assigned to Si–O–Si
asymmetric stretching vibrations of nanoclay, whereas silanol hydroxyl
group shows band at 3605 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum
of neat clay.42 In the FTIR spectrum of
bionanocomposites in Figure 2a, the band around 1000 cm–1 is shifted
to 1031 cm–1, whereas in the hydroxyl region, a
broad band is obtained. These changes in both regions revealed the
interaction between protein matrix and nanoclay.

Figure 3 shows the
amide II region spectra of pure proteins and derived composites. This
region is much more sensitive to the environment of N–H group.
Therefore, this region is very useful to track changes to the environment
of N–H group and responds differently in hydrogen-bonding environment.
Generally, N–H groups which are strongly hydrogen bonded absorb
at higher frequencies.43 There is a clear
increase in relative intensity around 1545 cm–1 in
all derived films as compare to the pure proteins which is related
to the presence of stronger hydrogen-bonded N–H group in the
composites. The clay present in the bionanocomposites can form a greater
number of hydrogen bonds; as a result, number of hydrogen-bonded peptide
groups is increased.

and PGCB2.

Figure 4 represents
the second derivative region (1615–1680 cm–1) of all films along with pure proteins. It allows the direct separation
of amide I band into its components and is used to identify the position
of individual amide I bands. Second derivative analysis revealed the
absorption band as negative bands in the second derivative spectrum.
The main component bands exhibited at 1651, 1658, and 1666 cm–1 in films can be assigned to α-helices and 310-helices respectively.44 The peak
at 1674 cm–1 can be assigned to antiparallel β-sheets/aggregated
strands.45 A significant difference can
be observed in the case of PGCB1; a band at 1638 cm–1 may be due to the fact that glycerol with clay promotes the formation
of higher number of α-helix and makes more interaction with
the proteins.

2.4 Crystallinity Study of Bionanocomposite Films
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis is an important method to determine
the crystal structure and evaluate changes in the crystallinity patterns
of protein biopolymers and nanoclays. Figure 5a,b shows the XRD patterns of pure nanoclay,
pure proteins, and bionanocomposites. The bentonite showed characteristics
diffraction peaks at 2θ angle of 6.13°, 19.83°, 28.58°,
and 35.04°, whereas pure proteins exhibited diffraction peaks
around 9°, 19.28°, 37.60°, and 43.80°. The peak
at about 2θ of 9° is commonly assigned to both α-helix
and β-sheet structures.36 By comparing
the XRD pattern of composite samples with pure proteins, all composites
showed broad peak at about 19° which corresponds to the β-sheet
structure, whereas the peak at 17.8° relates to the diffraction
pattern of α-helix.46 These two peaks
cannot be clearly assigned because of overlapping signals and resulting
in a broad single peak around 19.30°.46,47 In this perspective, all of the derived composite films contain
both α-helix and β-sheets which is consistent with the
results from FTIR, whereas all other characteristics peaks of pure
proteins and clay are either completely disappeared or greatly reduced
in the bionanocomposites which showed that proteins had developed
interactions with the plasticizer and clay. The differences are more
prominent in clay-based bionanocomposites which can be seen in XRD
diffractogram of PGCBI with the appearance of new distinct crystallinity
peaks. These variations might be associated with the crystal lattice
volume and constant that can alter the crystal plane; thus, the polymer
can be intercalated or exfoliated into the clay nanoplatelets, and
the new crystal plane was formed during the process.48,49

The peaks assigned to nanoclay at 2θ of 6.13°,
19.83°,
28.87°, and 35.04° completely disappeared in the case of
PGCB1. In addition to that, three new distinct crystallinity peaks
can be observed in PGCB1 at 2θ of 27.36°, 31.39°,
and 45.41°, showing additional crystallinity regions as compared
to other nanoclay-derived film (PGCB2) probably due to some new rearrangements
leading to crystallizations. However, in the case of PGBC2, the peak
around 9° disappeared and intensity of peaks at 37.60° and
43.80° is greatly reduced as compare to pure proteins.

As proteins are semi-crystalline polymers, conformation of chains
and resulting crystallinity is prone to surface interactions. Nanofiller
has a tendency to alter the degree and rate of crystallinity with
better mechanical properties particularly strength because of the
reinforcing effect promoted by the enhanced interactions between biopolymers
and nanoparticles and development of some new regions of crystallinity.50 The similar phenomenon is observed in PGCB1,
as the native crystallinity is disrupted and new crystallinity regions
are generated leading to improved mechanical strength as compare to
PGCB2. The studies have also shown that materials’ physical
properties particularly tensile strength depend on the molecular order.33 This might be the reason of highest tensile
strength of PGCB1 among other bionanocomposites that is consistent
with the mechanical strength data given in Table 1 and FTIR second derivative which showed
more interactions between protein and nanoclay.

2.5 Effects on Thermal Properties
Thermal
properties of the bionanocomposite films were studied using differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) by heating each sample from 25 to 300 °C
as represented in Figure 6. The first peak ranging from 116.05 to 162.83 °C in
all bionanocomposite films is related to the loss of bound moisture
present in the protein matrix.51 The water
loss peak for bionanocomposites containing 20% glycerol, that is,
PGC1 and PGCB1, was at higher temperatures 139.0 and 162.83 °C,
respectively, compared to bionanocomposites with 25% glycerol (PGC2
and PGCB2). This might be attributed to the greater availability of
loosely bound moisture in the case of 25% glycerol. In the case of
PGCB1, a water loss peak at higher temperature as compared to other
bionanocomposite attributed to better clay interactions with the polar
groups of proteins leading to decreased number of polar groups available
for moisture uptake through hydrogen bonding with water molecules.
Furthermore, the bound moisture present at the interior of bionanocomposites
is surrounded by nanoclays which make loss of this moisture difficult;
therefore, a delayed peak is observed in the case of PGBC1. The pure
proteins have a peak at 209 °C might be the glass transition
(Tg) of the proteins52 but the same peak is delayed in all bionanocomposites falling
around between 235 and 250 °C. Further, the incorporation of
nanofiller has an effect on the amorphous region of the proteins matrix
and might cause the shift in Tg of bionanocomposites
toward higher temperature. The change in Tg demonstrated higher thermoplasticity of derived films as compare
to pure proteins. Also, melting (Tm) and Tg peaks of bionanocomposites do not have big
difference because of the shift in Tg.
The melting peak (Tm) of proteins is around
282 °C, and same peak in PGC1 and PGC2 is at around 260 and 273
°C, respectively. The melting region is not obvious in PGCB1
and PGCB2, might be addition of clay increased their thermal stability
due to greater interaction of plasticized proteins with the clay which
could be ascribed to the presence of protein biopolymer into clay
galleries.53 In addition, some of the hydrophilic
groups of clays interact with hydrophilic groups of proteins, which
was originally present in the interior of the protein film. This is
consistent with tensile strength values as they have greater strength
as compare to PGC1 and PGC2.

PGC1, PGCB1, PGC2,
and PGCB2.

2.6 Thermal
Stability
The thermogravimetry
and differential thermogravimetry (DTG) curves of pure proteins and
derived films are presented in Figure 7. The weight loss in all films was observed 3–4%
before 100 °C which is due to the release of free water.54 Up to 188 °C, all four bionanocomposites
are thermally stable, followed by a loss which occurs due to degradation/evaporation
of glycerol (glycerol rich region). The sharp weight loss was observed
between 250 and 405 °C, rose up to 70% which is related to the
proteins’ helix structure, destruction of peptide chain/bridge
linkages.40 At 575 °C, the weight
loss in bionanocomposites went up to 84%, attributed to the protein
skeleton decomposition and conversion into lighter elements.

Figure 7 (a) TGA and
(b) DTG of pure proteins (P), PGC1, PGCB1, PGC2, and
PGCB2.

The weight loss in the case of
PGBC1 is the least and remaining
solid residue was 23% which was highest among all derived films. The
addition of nanoclay can delay the degradation temperature and form
inorganic network that act as a barrier against the gas transfer.
Thus, the diffusion of pyrolysis gases is hindered.55 In other words, the thermal stability was improved with
the intercalated/exfoliated structure, which was due to the movement
of the biopolymer chains being reduced by the incorporation of nanoclay.33 The dispersion of clay within the protein matrix
may reduce the nature or degree of interactions (hydrogen bonding,
van der waals or ionic) between protein polypeptide chains which hold
them together, and thus properties of the composites are altered.
Similarly, better dispersion of nanoclay in the protein matrix in
PGCB1 disturbed the interactions to a greater degree between protein
chains as evident from the FTIR, XRD, and DSC. Further, the result
is very well supported from the tensile strength of PGBC1, that is,
highest among all derived films.

In the DTG curve, the minimum
of DTG curve depicts the maximum
weight loss at that specific temperature. The DTG analysis curve represents
two main degradation stages, first loss was up to 24% between a temperature
range of 185 to 194 °C which can be ascribed to loss of plasticizer
(glycerol) present in the glycerol-rich zone. From DTG graph, it clearly
represents for all of the blends, the weight loss starts from around
230 °C and reaches a maximum decomposition (24–46%) between
310 and 326 °C that is related to the protein-rich zone where
glycerol is bonded to proteins strongly.

2.7 TEM Analysis
Bionanocomposite films
were also analyzed by TEM to observe nanoclay incorporation and its
dispersion/aggregation within the protein polymer matrix. TEM images
shown in Figure 8 clearly
represent the presence of dark lines of nanoclay sheets in PGCB1 (Figure 8B) and PGCB2 (Figure 8C) bionanocomposites,
whereas the TEM image of neat sample PGC1 (Figure 8A) has no such dark lines which was taken
as a control. TEM images of both bionanocomposites (PGCB1 and PGCB2)
displayed exfoliation as well as intercalation of nanoclay sheets
in the polymer matrix as have been marked in Figure 8B,C.

Figure 8 TEM images of (A) PGC1, (B) PGCB1, and (C) PGCB2.

In PGCB2 revealed relatively less
dispersion of nanoclay in the
matrix with the intercalated region and the presence of some stacked
layers of nanoclay (Figure 8C), whereas PGCB1 exhibited clear intercalation and exfoliation
of nanoclay as marked in Figure 8B. Dispersion as stacks of silicate layers are uniformly
dispersed in the polymer. This distribution can be attributed to the
insertion of protein chains into the galleries of nanoclay which results
to good exfoliation/intercalation of silicate layers. The homogeneous
dispersion in the polymer matrix is well supported and confirmed by
the XRD investigation, where new crystallinity peaks were appeared
and nanoclay crystallinity peaks have been greatly reduced in the
PGCB1 bionanocomposite.

2.8 Viscoelastic Properties
Dynamic mechanical
analysis (DMA) is a technique, used to measure the viscoelastic properties
of the polymers with changing temperature. Proteins experience several
thermal transitions on heating or cooling as they are semi-crystalline
polymers. Thermal transitions are generally related to the chain mobility
of the polymers56 and determined from the
peak of the tan δ curve. Generally, DMA analysis is represented
as a function of temperature with storage modulus and damping or tan
δ.

Two transitions in both the storage modulus and tan
δ values of all bionanocomposites are seen in Figure 9a,b. These may be attributed
to glycerol-rich and protein-rich regions. Literature suggested that
glycerol promotes the formation of disordered structure and leads
to two glass transitions, assigned to glycerol-rich and protein-rich
domains.57,58

Figure 9 DMA thermograms E′ (a)
and tan δ
(b) PGC1, PGCB1, PGC2, and PGCB2.

Figure 9a
clearly
represents that at −90 °C, PGCB1 has the highest E′ as compared to all other bionanocomposites. With
the increase in temperature, a rapid decline in E′ was observed for PGC1 and PGC2 bionanocomposite films, whereas
clay-based bionanocomposites showed a gradual decrease. The decrease
was more prominent from 74 to 144 °C in PGC1 and PGC2, whereas
PGCB1 and PGCB2 exhibited higher and steady decrease in E′. Studies have shown that higher storage modulus is observed
because of the more interactions between filler and matrix.8

Figure 9a shows
that the drop in E′ value of all blends is
like synthetic polymers and such relaxation is thermoplastic material-related
characteristic. The transitions for all blends represent a good compatibility
of glycerol with proteins.51 The low molecular
weight of glycerol enables it to incorporate itself into the polymer
chain and lubricate it easily. Thus, the protein–glycerol interaction
is developed at the expense of protein–protein interaction.
This is in agreement with the free volume theory of the plasticization.59 The storage modulus value of film PGBC1 is highest
among all films. This is in agreement with the FTIR data, as higher
value of E′ means higher volume fraction and
better interaction between matrix and nanoparticle.60

Two transitions in the tan δ graph of all bionanocomposites
are shown in Figure 9b. These may be attributed to glycerol-rich and protein-rich regions.
Similar transitions have been found in the literature for other glycerol
plasticized films which can be assigned to glycerol-rich and protein-rich
domains.56,61 The Figure 9b, tan δ curve shows the second maxima for all
blends between −6 and 123 °C. From the tan δ curve,
an increase in the tan δ peak size of blend PGBC1 is evident
as compare to other three films. As size of tan δ is related
to the volume of fraction of the material experiencing transition,44 therefore, a higher change in tan δ peak
of blend PGCB1, suggested that it undergoes glass-transition phenomenon
to greater extent. This illustrates that more interactions are present
between proteins and nanoclay as supported by the TEM and FTIR data.

2.9 Water Vapor Permeability
One of the
most important functions of a food package is to preserve the food
from moisture or at least lower down the moisture transfer between
the food and the environment. In order to achieve this, water vapor
permeability (WVP) should be as low as possible.62 WVP and water vapor transmission rate of all bionanocomposite
films are shown in Table 2. The WVP of the films are ranging from 2.18 to 2.72 g mm/m2 d kPa. It is less permeable as compared to those films prepared
from similar kinds of proteins such as myofibrillar proteins from
turkey and fish.63 Because glycerol is
hydrophilic in nature, its concentration may increase the WVP because
of the presence of more OH groups to attract water. The same phenomenon
was observed in PGC2 and PGCB2 bionanocomposites. The bionanocomposites
with 25% glycerol contents have higher WVP compared to the film based
on 20% glycerol with 5% clay (PGCB1) which is least permeable probably
due to less glycerol content and better dispersion of nanoclay in
the protein matrix. The nanoclay particles act as physical barriers
against the movement of water molecules, that is, WVP is decreased
by the tortuous path created by the nanoclay particle for diffusion
of water molecules.64,65 The results are well supported
by the TEM analysis.

3 Conclusions
In this study, proteins were extracted from
spent hens and transformed
into the food packaging films. In the first attempt, proteins were
plasticized with glycerol and cross-linked with the help of chitosan.
Further, nanoclay was introduced successfully into the protein matrix
to enhance their mechanical strength. Compared to chitosan/glycerol
plasticized films, the nanoclay reinforced films showed substantial
improvement in mechanical strength which was almost double than the
chitosan/glycerol plasticized films. In addition to that, films have
also lower WVP, better thermal properties, and good viscoelastic behavior.
The above results suggested that spent hen proteins can be used to
develop protein/clay hybrid bionanocomposite films with improved functional
properties which make them good candidate for food packaging material.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Whole
spent hen (including
skin, bones, breast, leg, and gizzard) was received with the help
of Alberta Hatching Egg Producers (AHEP) (Edmonton, AB, Canada). The
whole spent birds were ground at Agri-Food Discovery Place (AFDP),
a world-class small scale pilot processing facility at the University
of Alberta. The birds were first ground using a meat grinder with
a 5 mm plate and then passed through a Stephan Emulsion Mill with
a 1.3 mm disk. The ground meat was divided into different samples.
The samples were filled in polyethylene bags and kept at −20
°C until use. Before extraction, samples were thawed overnight
at 4 °C. Chitosan, glutaraldehyde, glycerol, 1,2-butanediol,
sorbitol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, nanoclay (bentonite),
HCl, and NaOH were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.

4.2 Protein Extraction
For the extraction
of proteins, McCurdy method was used with some modifications.66 The whole spent hen sample was mixed with ice
cold distilled water (1:4) by using a homogenizer for 15 min. The
pH of the resulting mixture was raised to 12 by using 2.0 M NaOH under
constant stirring. Further, the slurry was centrifuged (13 000g) at 4 °C for 10 min using a controlled temperature
centrifuge. Thus, three layers were formed, an upper layer of fat,
middle layer of soluble proteins, and a bottom insoluble layer. The
middle layer, containing proteins, was separated carefully, and pH
was adjusted to 5.75 by using 4 M HCl to precipitate the proteins.
The precipitated proteins were centrifuged (13 000g) at 4 °C for 10 min. The precipitate was washed with deionized
water three times followed by filtration. Finally, it was freeze-dried
to obtain protein powder.

4.3 Protein Recovery and Purity
The total
protein content of both the raw whole spent hen and final protein
isolates was determined by a LECO (Nitrogen/Carbon) analyzer (TruSpec
CN, MI, CA, USA). Raw spent hen meat and protein isolates were freeze-dried
in a drier (LABCONCO Inc., FreeZone12, MO, CA, USA) and ground into
fine powder before analysis. The factor 6.25 was used for converting
nitrogen measurement to protein. The recovery yield was measured as
difference in total protein contents of isolates and raw material
using method reported by Omana et al.67

4.4 Sample Preparation
Initially, plasticizers
including sorbitol, ethylene glycol, poly(ethylene)glycol, glycerol,
and butanediol were scanned to find out interaction of plasticizers
with protein. The blends of protein with plasticizers (10, 15, 20,
25, 30, and 35%) were prepared and compression molded. Mostly nonhomogeneous
and too brittle films were obtained with all other plasticizers except
glycerol; therefore, glycerol was chosen and investigated further.
As protein-based films have low mechanical strength, so the study
was focused to increase the tensile strength of protein films and
only films with better mechanical strength were further studied. Glycerol
was found better plasticizer with these proteins; therefore, only
films prepared with glycerol are reported here. Different blends of
spent hen proteins were prepared. The blends using glycerol, chitosan,
and bentonite were prepared using a laboratory blender for 30 min.
Blends were sealed in a plastic bag and kept at room temperature for
72 h to give maximum time for nanoparticles to interact with the proteins.

4.5 Film Preparation
Films of plasticized
materials were prepared by compression molding the resin for 10 min
at 120 °C and 3500 psi pressure using a carver press.

4.6 Film Thickness
Digital caliper (Digi-Max
Caliper, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used to measure thickness and width
of the films at three different places, and the values were averaged.
The average film thickness was used for the determination of mechanical
properties, dynamics mechanical properties, and WVP.

4.7 Thermal Property Measurement
The
thermal stabilities of the extracted spent hen protein powder and
derived films were studied using TGA Q50 (TA Instrument, USA) under
a continuous nitrogen flow between 25 and 600 °C at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min.

The denaturation behaviors and phase
transitions were investigated using a calorimetric apparatus (2920
Modulated DSC, TA Instrument, USA) in a continuous flowing nitrogen
atmosphere. The instrument was calibrated for heat flow and temperature
using a sample of pure indium. All samples were scanned at a heating
rate of 5 °C per minute in a temperature range of 25–300
°C.

4.8 Mechanical Property Measurement
Tensile
properties (tensile strength and elongation to break) of the films
were measured in triplicate at room temperature using a universal
testing machine (Autograph AGS-X Shimadzu, Canada) following ASTM
standard method D822. The averaged specimen dimensions were 50 mm
× 9 mm × 0.4 mm (length × width × thickness).
A 50 N load cell with a crosshead speed of 0.90 mm/s was used. Before
testing, samples were equilibrated at 25 °C and 65% relative
humidity (RH) for 48 h.

4.9 X-ray Diffraction
XRD analyses were
performed using a Rigaku Ultima IV XRD unit with Co radiation operated
at 38 kV and 38 mA. The samples were scanned from 5° to 50°
(2θ) in a continuous scanning mode at rate of 2°/min with
a 0.02 step size.

4.10 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
The
viscoelastic properties of films were measured by using DMA Q800 (TA
Instrument). The films were conditioned for 48 hours in a desiccator
at 50% RH. The analysis was carried out in a tensile mode at an oscillatory
frequency of 1 Hz with an applied deformation of 0.2% during heating
with a temperature scan from −90 to 200 °C with a heating
rate 2 °C/min. Rectangular samples of average dimensions 16 ×
7 × 0.40 (length × width × thickness) were used for
obtaining tan δ and storage modulus as a function of temperature
(Paschoalick, 2003). Each sample was analyzed in duplicate at least
and average values reported.

4.11 Transmission
Electron Microscopy
TEM images of films were taken by using
a TEM/STEM Morgagni 268 (Philips,
Hillsboro, USA) instrument operated at 80 kV. Small piece of each
film was obtained, and their ultrastructure was preserved by using
fixative solution (2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1
M phosphate buffer of pH 7.3) for a week. Films were dehydrated by
rinsing with series of graded ethanol (50, 70, 90, and 100%) using
20 min of rinsing for each solution. Then, infiltration of each sample
was performed with an ethanol/spurr resin mixture (1:1 ratio for 2
h). The mixture was removed followed by the addition of fresh spur
resin only. After that each sample was embedded in flat molds with
fresh spurr resin and cured at 70 °C in an oven overnight. Film
samples of 0.4 mm thickness were sectioned and picked up on a copper
grid.

4.12 ATR–FTIR Analysis
FTIR (Bruker
Optics, Esslingen, Germany) equipped with a single bounce diamond
ATR crystal was used to determine functional group changes of the
powdered protein and prepared films. The analysis for each sample
was performed in the wavelength range of 410–4000 cm–1. All sample spectra were collected using 16 scans at a resolution
of 4 cm–1 and averaged using OPUS software version
6.5 provided by Bruker. A background spectrum of the clean ATR crystal
was taken before running the sample spectrum. Spectral examination,
measurements, and processing were done using Nicolet OMNIC spectra
software.

4.13 Water Vapor Permeability
WVP was
carried out gravimetrically using ASTM standard method E96-95 with
some modifications. The film samples were first sealed on a permeation
cell (exposed film area 3.14 × 10–3) containing
anhydrous calcium chloride (0% RH). The cell was then placed in a
desiccator containing saturated sodium chloride solution (75% RH).
The cell weight was observed after every 24 h for 6 days.
