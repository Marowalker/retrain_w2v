Hydrogels have received
considerable attention due to their potential
applications in the fields of drug delivery, tissue engineering, and
stimuli-responsive devices. Nonetheless, it is still a great difficulty
in designing hydrogels with multifunctional characteristics including
excellent antibacterial activity and appropriate mechanical and remarkable
sensing properties. In the present study, a novel type of organic–inorganic
adhesive is demonstrated, which comprises inorganic matter of amorphous
calcium phosphate particles and organic substances of poly(acrylic
acid) and chitosan. The hydrogel possesses excellent biocompatible
and antibacterial activity, unique viscoelastic properties, high quantity
of drug load, and remarkably sensitive pressure sensing, which have
potential use as antibacterial biomaterials, artificially intelligent
skins, and drug delivery carriers.

Introduction
Hydrogels, three-dimensionally
interconnected porous polymers,
have received extensive attention because of their peculiar properties
of high moisture content, hydrophilic nature, softness, and biocompatibility.
They have been widely used in biomedical fields, for instance, drug
carriers,1 tissue engineering,2 wound dressing, and artificial skins under specific
environmental stimuli-responsive conditions of pressure, pH,3 and ionic strength, strain,4 temperature,5 humidity,6 twist deformation,7 etc.8 Moreover, their particular structural
and mechanical performances can be designed to fulfill specific demands
when they are fabricated to the capacitive pressure sensors.4,9 It is of great significance for hydrogels to be developed and applied
in terms of artificial skins with the fast development of artificial
intelligence technology. Suo and co-workers developed the polyacrylamide
(PAAm) hydrogel sensors with good biocompatibility and stretchability,
which could detect a wide strain range from 1 to 500% and measure
pressure as low as 1 kPa, widely extending the designability of artificially
intelligent skins.4b Nevertheless, PAAm
hydrogels with chemical crosslinks are short of self-healing ability
and have bad intimate surface contact.4b,10 Wu et al.9a reported a mineral hydrogel consisting of amorphous
calcium carbonate (ACC) nanoparticles that interacted with poly(acrylic
acid) (PAA) and alginates, which could be utilized as a capacitive
sensor with recyclable, self-healing, and superior mechanical properties.
However, mineral hydrogels suffer from lack of antibacterial activity
or antifouling ability and of stability under low pH conditions, which
limit their widespread application. It is a big challenge to develop
high-performance flexible intelligent skins with combined properties
of antibacterial activity, excellent rheological property, and sensitiveness
to external stimuli.

Here, we investigated a unique mineral
hydrogel with physically
crosslinked frameworks of natural polymer chitosan (CS) and poly(acrylic
acid) (PAA). Chitosan was chosen because it is a hydrophilic polymer
with excellent antimicrobial, biocompatible, and biodegradable properties.11 The linear polysaccharide of each C6 unit contains
amino and hydroxyl groups, which is derived from deacetylation of
chitin from crustaceans, insects, fungi, etc. Its antimicrobial properties
are attributed to the positive charge obtained from the availability
of free amino groups in chitosan, which interacts with the bacterial
cell membrane.12

In consideration
of the mentioned concerns and the inspiration
of the mineral hydrogel originally from the biomineralization process,13 a unique organic–inorganic hydrogel with
merits of improved pH stability,14 chitosan
producing antibacterial activity, and excellent sensing capability
was designed as a novel artificially intelligent skin. As far as we
know, there remain few reports about hydrogels with similar multifunctional
properties. Herein, the hydrogel was successfully prepared through
a facile procedure, which comprises amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP)
nanoparticles entrapped within physically crosslinked polymer frameworks.
Rheological properties, self-healable and moldable properties, swelling
behaviors, drug release, and antibacterial effects of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis were investigated to develop potential applications in artificially
intelligent skins and drug delivery.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of an Elastic Compressible Self-Healing Mineral Hydrogel
The ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel was synthesized by introducing CaCl2 solution containing PAA into the solution of Na2HPO4 mixed with CS (wt % ≤ 0.1%) under vigorous
stirring at ambient conditions (see Experimental
Section). The resultant products are white sticky hydrogels
(Figure S1a, Supporting Information) with
shapeable and self-healing ability. They can be shaped into macroscopic
objects with various shapes (Figure S2,
Supporting Information). When two hydrogel cylinders with different
colors were brought into contact, they would fuse together without
any gaps in several minutes (Figure S3,
Supporting Information), which implies the excellent self-healing
property of hydrogels. However, a higher amount of CS (>0.5 wt
%)
would result in yellow, tough, nonviscous, and inelastic rubberlike
aggregates (Figure S1a, Supporting Information),
which do not show self-healing property.

The lyophilized ACP/PAA/CS
hydrogel displays interconnected porous microstructures (Figures 1 and S1c). The dry gel could recover quickly within
an hour in different solutions (Figure S4, Supporting Information) and maintain the properties as the newly
synthesized hydrogels. The dried hydrogel sample at 25 °C exhibits fast swelling
kinetics in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH = 7.4 and 8.3) and
water and reaches maximum swelling ratios of 1.5, 2.75, and 1.7 g/g,
respectively, at around 20 min.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel
formation.

The Fourier-transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra of the ACP/PAA/CS
hydrogel are displayed in Figure 2a. The peaks at 1068 and 508 cm–1 marked with a blue frame are typical phosphate bending vibration
attributed to the presence of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP).15 The X-ray diffraction pattern of the freeze-dried
ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel does not show sharp peaks (Figure S5, Supporting Information), which confirms the amorphous
feature of the hydrogel. The peak (Figure 2a) corresponding to the carboxylic group
shifts from 1720 cm–1 (υCOOH) to
1709 cm–1 (υCOO–), which implies the deprotonation of the COOH groups of PAA molecules.
This deprotonation phenomenon was also observed in the ACP/PAA hydrogel
synthesized in similar conditions without the CS polymer, suggesting
the formation of a Ca2+–COO– complex
in the hydrogel. It was reported that pure Ca2+ and PAA
molecules (Mw = 100 000) could also produce hydrogels in high
pH values.16 In the current case, the formed
ACP particles provide new nodes for the crosslinking of PAA molecules,
where deprotonated PAA can interact with Ca2+ on the surface
of ACP nanoparticles. As CS was also introduced into the hydrogel,
new bands were observed for ACP/PAA/CS hydrogels compared with the
pure ACP/PAA hydrogel. The FT-IR spectrum reveals that the intensity
and shape of amide peaks I and II at 1649 and 1589 cm–1, respectively, in CS have changed significantly in the ACP/PAA/CS
hydrogel, producing two new corresponding peaks at 1709 and 1555 cm–1 attributed to the COO– groups in
PAA9a and the NH3+ absorption of CS,17 respectively. The COO– groups in PAA
can interact with ACP as well as NH3+ groups in CS to form crosslinked frameworks
through electrostatic interaction in hydrogels. The typical models
of ACP/PAA/CS hydrogels can be illustrated in Figure 1, where ACP nanoparticles are trapped within
the frameworks of two polymers.

Figure 2 (a) FT-IR spectra for CS, ACP/PAA, and
ACP/PAA/CS. (b) Thermogravimetric
(TG) and differential scanning calorimetry curves of the ACP/PAA/CS
hydrogel.

TG measurement of the hydrogel
shows a three-stage degradation
behavior for the dry hydrogel (Figure 2b). In the first stage, the weight loss of about 23
wt % below 360°C is attributed to the release of free and structural
water.18 The second stage from 361 to 730
°C is the thermal degradation region, which includes the decomposition
of CS and PAA. The third step up to 841 °C with a mass loss of
15 wt % is ascribed to the transformation of ACP into the crystalline
state. The calculated mass percent of ACP in the dry gel is up to
35 wt %. Thus, the weight ratio of ACP with the polymer and water
is about 35:42:23.

Rheological Properties of the ACP/PAA/CS
Hydrogel
The
rheological characterization of the ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel (Figure 3a) reveals that the
storage modulus G′ and loss modulus G″ increase with the increase of angular frequency
and the former is slightly higher than the latter modulus at 25 °C,
which is a typical property of gels with a certain rigid structure.19 The values of both moduli are high, implying
the better mechanical strength of the hydrogel.20 A linear increase in both moduli with increasing frequencies
is observed, which is consistent with the Maxwell model. Besides,
the hydrogel revealed the representative property of crosslinking
materials despite the degree of crosslinking density from both moduli
with nonzero limiting values at low frequencies (Figure 3a). The shape of the storage
modulus profile is somewhere between typical curves of the polymer
with unlinked molecular chains and a soft gel.19 The rheological data of the ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel show a
higher modulus than that of the ACP–PAA hydrogel (Figure S6, Supporting Information), probably
due to the increased cohesion strength of new crosslinking between
NH3+ and COO– when CS is introduced.

Figure 3 Rheological properties
of the ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel. (a, b) Frequency
dependencies and temperatures of the storage (G′)
and loss (G″) moduli; (c) the hydrogel thixotropy;
(d) the curve of shear rate and shear stress.

A distinct increase in both G′ and G″ (Figure 3b) with an increase in temperature in the range of 25–35
°C and a slight decrease above 35 °C demonstrate the good
thermostability and the strong physical crosslinks within the hydrogel
under different temperatures. Interestingly, G′
> G″ occurs during the temperature changes,
i.e., the elastic behavior of the hydrogel is changed to the dominant
response, which is on account of the reduction of water within the
hydrogel. Figure 3c
shows that the sample displays fast recovery of mechanical properties
after a sharp oscillatory breakdown, called thixotropy. Under the
condition of an oscillatory force of 600% at a frequency of 1.0 Hz,
the G′ value decreases from 1.41 kPa to 6.8
Pa, leading to a solid–liquid state (tan δ = G″/G′ = 1.0). However, when
the amplitude is decreased to the initial force (γ = 1%) with
the same frequency, G′ will rapidly recover
to the initial value accompanying the sample to a quasi-liquid state
(tan δ > 1), which indicates that the ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel
has an excellent self-healing property as verified by the self-healable
test (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Figure 3d shows a decrease
in stress with increasing shear rates, which is a typical characteristic
of the hydrogel.

In Vitro Cell Compatibility and Antibacterial
Assay for the
ACP/PAA/CS Hydrogel
Good biocompatibility is necessary for
well-designed materials in the biomedical field.21 The in vitro cytocompatibility of the ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel
to the normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cells was detected by means of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. As displayed in Figure 4, the relative percent cell viability with
respect to concentrations of the hydrogel after 24 h was maintained
above 99%. Even at high concentrations, the hydrogel did not induce
a significant cytotoxic effect. The microscopy images show that there
were no obvious differences in the quantity and shape of NHDF cells
(Figure S7, Supporting Information). The
above results demonstrated that the ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel had no significant
influence on the growth of NHDF cells. The low cytotoxicity originates
from the good biocompatibility of the hydrogel, which may have promising
applications in the biomedical field.

Figure 4 Relative percent cell viability with respect
to concentrations
of the hydrogel extracts.

Besides serving as a barrier to avoid external bacterial infection,
a desired biomedical hydrogel with inherent antibacterial properties
will be more promising. In the antibacterial test through the direct
contact, both E. coli (Gram-negative
bacterium) and B. subtilis (Gram-positive
bacterium) strains were chosen to test the antibacterial activity
of the surface ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel. When brought into contact with
the hydrogel for 24 h at 37 °C, bacteria treated with 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl-2H-tetrazolium
chloride (CTC) were used to evaluate the respiratory activity of E. coli. Live bacteria can metabolize CTC and produce
an insoluble and red fluorescent formazan, while dead or unhealthy
ones will not reduce CTC.22 Laser scanning
confocal microscopic images showed that few healthy bacteria were
observed on the surface of the hydrogel after 24 h of incubation in
the bacterial suspension, while plenty of bacteria grew on the contrastive
glass surface (Figure 5a,c), combined with about 50% bacterial viability from the quantitative
antibacterial efficiency shown in Figure 5c,f, indicating that the hydrogel has excellent
inherent antibacterial properties to both E. coli and B. subtilis. This is mainly ascribed
to the positively charged amino groups, which could damage the bacterial
walls and destroy the integrity of the cells through electrostatic
interactions, causing the release of intracellular matter.12a,23

were used to distinguish live (red) bacteria.

Sustained Release of Kanamycin Sulfate (KS) in Vitro
Most
of the hydrogels were shown to be excellent drug carriers due
to their porous structure and excellent biocompatibility. Hence, we
performed kanamycin sulfate (KS) as a test drug and adsorbed it within
the hydrogel to improve the antibacterial activity. The contrast test
reveals that ACP/PAA/CS hydrogels are more stable than ACP/PAA hydrogels
at acidic pHs or in PBS (7.4) (Figure S9, Supporting Information), which will degrade rapidly (20 min at
pH 1.2, 80 min at pH 6.8, and 120 min at pH 7.4; the results are shown
in Figure S8, Supporting Information) and
cause the burst release of drugs. Obviously, the introduced CS molecules
provide more stable frameworks than PAA molecules alone.

The
drug KS load can reach a maximum value of 14.1%, based on the standard
curve of KS shown (Figure S10, Supporting
Information). Meanwhile, the encapsulation efficiency achieves 92.2%.
Generally, the drug release from the hydrogel follows the principles
of drug diffusion or/and hydrogel degradation. The linear graph between
the drug release and time of the system is controlled by polymer erosion,
while a parabolic curve between the drug release and time is controlled
by drug diffusion.24 From the release property
of KS-loaded ACP/PAA/CS hydrogels at pH 7.4 in vitro (Figure 6), it can be noted that the
drug release rates of the ACP/PAA hydrogel and ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel
with 0.05% reach 100% within 3 h, which is ascribed to their stability
at pH 7.4. The ACP/PAA hydrogel is lost at about 2 h at pH 7.4, and
the ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel with 0.05% shows a similar situation at 3
h, resulting in drug release (shown in Figure S8c, Supporting Information). Although the ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel
with 0.5% has good stability at pH 7.4, the maximum of the drug cumulative
release rate with 70% is lower than ACP/PAA/CS hydrogels with 0.08
and 0.1% CS that reach 90% for the maximum after 6 h. They both obey
a first-order kinetic process with a linear regression of 0.94 during
the first 6 h for the complex hydrogel made through the adsorption
method. Later, the release rate remains a constant, which indicates
that the hydrogels can sustainably release kanamycin sulfate in vitro
as a potential drug carrier.

Figure 6 Drug release properties of ACP/PAA/CS and ACP/PAA
hydrogels.

Capacitance of the Hydrogel
Sensor
The excellent viscoelasticity,
mechanical compliance, and self-healing ability of the prepared hydrogel
facilitate the construction of unique artificially intelligent skins.
Herein, a capacitive pressure sensor was designed (inset in Figure 7a) according to eq 1(9a) 1  in which C stands for the
capacitance, ε is the dielectric constant of the dielectric
layer, k is the electrostatic constant, S is the contacting area of the conducting layer, and d is the distance of the dielectric layer. This was used to measure
the capacitance changes of the device as a function of compressive
pressure at 0 and 24 h. Its capacitance remains linearly responsive
within 5 kPa (Figure 7a). The pressure sensitivity S (the slope of the
trace)25 is 5.264 kPa–1, about 31 times more sensitive than 0.17 kPa–1 of the ACC/PAA/alginate hydrogel reported by Wu group.9a However, the pressure sensitivity decreased
to 0.725 kPa–1 with a prolonged time of 24 h (Figure 7b), which is ascribed
to the water evaporation of the hydrogel. Therefore, it is important
to restrain water evaporation of the hydrogel for better pressure
sensitivity.

0 to 10 kPa at 0 h (a) and 24 h (b). (c) Durability of the sensor

variations from 152 to 160 cycles. (e) Schematic finger motion hydrogel
sensor for finger bending and unbending cyclically for 48 h. (f) Hydrogel
pressure sensor served as a flexible sensor for detecting human voice
“Ke”.

The durability test of
the sensor under a pressure of 1 kPa (Figure 7c,d) indicates the
stability of the capacitance–pressure curves for 200 cycles,
indicating the high reliability of the ACP/PAA/CS hydrogel device.
Based on the character, we assembled a capacitance sensor enveloped
by two layers of VHB tape and placed it onto a finger to detect human
finger motion (inset in Figure 7d). When the finger bends, the hydrogel deforms severely,
resulting in an increase in the capacitance signals. This alternately
straightening and bending processes were carried out many times without
an obvious loss in the capacitance peak (Figure 7e). Additionally, it can also be applied
to monitor the pressure produced by vocal cord vibration if the hydrogel
sensor was adhered to the human throat (Figure 7f). All of these properties show that ACP/PAA/CS
hydrogels have potential application as extremely sensitive pressure
sensors for artificially intelligent skins and wearable devices.

Conclusions
Briefly, novel ACP/PAA/CS hydrogels composed
of ACP particles and
macromolecules of PAA and chitosan have been prepared through a facile
procedure. The obtained hydrogels possess multiple properties including
excellent biocompatibility, self-healing ability, antibacterial activity,
good mechanical compliance, and sensing properties for highly sensitive
pressure sensing for finger motion. These hydrogels may serve as promising
materials as drug carrier vehicles and as artificially intelligent
skins, wearable devices, etc.

Experimental Section
Preparation of the ACP/PAA/CS
Hydrogel
A mixed solution
of Na2HPO4 (0.17 M) and chitosan (0.1 wt %)
with 0.1% acetic acid was slowly (3 mL min–1) poured
into another solution containing CaCl2 (0.2 M) and poly(acrylic
acid) (PAA, 5%, v/v) with stirring. A white sticky hydrogel rapidly
formed under the stir bar. After stirring for a few minutes, the turbid
solution became clear and then the product was washed with purified
water until the last washing water was clear. Hydrogels containing
different amounts of CS (0.05, 0.08, and 0.5 wt %) could be prepared
via the above procedure. The ACP/PAA hydrogel was prepared in the
same way without the introduction of CS.

Swelling Behavior of the
Hydrogel
The dry ACP/PAA/CS
hydrogel was separately dipped in PBS with different pH (7.4 and 8.3)
values at 37 °C. The mass of the wet hydrogels was weighed at
0–260 min with an interval of 20 min during the soaking. The
swelling ratio (%) was calculated according to the formula: (Wi – W0)/W0 × 100%, in which Wi is the mass of the swollen hydrogel at every time point and W0 is the mass of the hydrogel at 0 min.

Cell Culture
and Cytotoxicity Test
Cytotoxicity evaluation
for the extract of the hydrogel was obtained by means of the MTT assay
according to the International Standard ISO 10993-5:2009. The extracts
from hydrogels (100, 80, 60, 40, and 20 wt %) were prepared according
to the International Standard ISO 10993-12:2012. NHDF cells were used,
which were incubated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium with
10% fetal bovine serum plus 1% penicillin/streptomycin on 96-well
plates (5 × 103 cells/well) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. After 20 h, the media were replaced
by fresh growth media containing different concentrations of samples
for 24 h. Generally, 20 μL of MTT solution with 5 mg mL–1 PBS was pumped into each well of the plate. The NHDF
cells were cultivated for another 4 h. Then, 150 μL of dimethyl
sulfoxide was added to each well, where the supernatant was discarded.
After shaking for 10 min, the plate was measured at 490 nm using a
microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific).The cytotoxicity was
evaluated according to the equation: cell viability% = Ai/Ac × 100%, in which Ai stands for the absorbance of the sample and Ac means the absorbance of the control.

Load and
Release of Kanamycin Sulfate
The freeze-dried
hydrogel (0.1 mg) was immerged in a conical flask (100 mL) containing
15 mL of kanamycin sulfate (KS) solution (1 mg mL–1) on a shaking reactor with an agitation speed of 80 rpm at 37 °C
for 24 h. Then, the ultraviolet absorbance of KS in the solution was
detected at 278 nm by spectrophotometry to calculate its concentration
according to the standard curve. Meanwhile, the drug absorbance was
also detected after the drug-loading hydrogel was washed twice with
distilled water. The drug-loading capicity and encapsulation efficiency
were calculated according to the equations: W1/W2 × 100% and (W3 – W4)/W3 × 100%, respectively, in which W1 stands for the mass of KS within the hydrogel, W2 is the net mass of the hydrogel, W3 is the total drug mass, and W4 is the mass of the drug that remained in the solution.

The
KS-loaded hydrogels were enclosed in a teabag and introduced in the
basket of the drug release apparatus. They were then placed in 150
mL of phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS, pH 7.4) at 37°C,
and the basket was stirred at a speed of 50 rpm. Then, 5 mL of the
solution was removed at hourly intervals and the amount of KS was
analyzed by spectrophotometry. At the same time, 5 mL of fresh PBS
solution was periodically added to maintain the original PBS volume.

Bacterial Tests
E. coli (ATCC
25922) and B. subtilis (ATCC
6633) strains were chosen to detect the antibacterial activity of
the hydrogel surface through direct contact. The strains were cultured
with Luria–Bertani liquid medium, pH 7.0 in a thermostatic
incubator at 37 °C for 20 h. The hydrogels sterilized by UV irradiation
were deposited in a 6-well plate containing 2 mL of strains with a
density of 8 × 105 CFU mL–1 after
incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. The control group was carried out
with the strain solution being in contact with the glass slides instead
of the hydrogel in a similar procedure. After 24 h, CTC was utilized
to assess the vitality of the bacteria on the surface of the hydrogel
and glass slide. Each sample was observed under a laser scanning confocal
microscope (Zeiss LSM 880 microscope, Germany). The optimal excitation/emission
wavelength was 450/630 nm.

Capacitance of the Hydrogel Sensor
The dielectric layer
(30 μm in thickness) was caught between two layers of hydrogels
in connection with two metallic electrodes9a (Figure S11, Supporting Information).
Moreover, the additional two layers of polyethylene films were put
on both sides of the sensor to isolate the sensor and avoid water
evaporation. The capacitance–pressure curve of the hydrogel
sensor was recorded on a combination of a tensile machine (HY-0230,
China) with a deformation rate of 1 mm min–1 at
25 °C and an LCR meter (TH2830, China) at an AC voltage of 1
V and a sweeping frequency of 1 kHz. The LCR meter was utilized to
detect simultaneous capacitive changes under different stimuli on
the device. The pressure sensitivity S could be got
from the slope of the traces in the capacitance–pressure curve, S = δ(ΔC/C0)/δp.9b
