Photon
upconverted emission based on dye-sensitized triplet–triplet
annihilation was observed in silica gel systems containing Pt(II)
octaethylporphyrin (triplet sensitizer) and 9,10-diphenylanthracene
(singlet emitter). The triplet sensitizer was encapsulated and highly
dispersed in the silica gels prepared by the sol–gel method.
The singlet emitter was adsorbed on the silica gel pores accessible
to the outside. Phosphorescence of the triplet sensitizer was partially
quenched, and the singlet emission was enhanced with an increase in
the concentration of the singlet emitter. The emission intensity increased
in proportion to the approximate square of the irradiation power.
The triplet energy transfer from some of the encapsulated triplet
sensitizer molecules to the adsorbed singlet emitter molecules was
observed in the silica gels followed by the triplet–triplet
annihilation and upconverted singlet emission. The phosphorescence
quenching and upconverted singlet emission were more significantly
observed in the gel dried at a lower temperature (wetter gel). The
wetter gel contained higher amounts of solvent and water molecules,
in which the triplet sensitizer and singlet emitter should collide
and then the sensitized emitters should collide between themselves
during their excited-state lifetime. The photon upconversion process
required the triplet sensitizer and singlet emitter molecules to be
in an environment similar to the solvents.

Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar
cells (DSSCs) are widely investigated worldwide
as a new type of solar cell exhibiting high performance.1−3 The energy conversion efficiency of the DSSCs can be enhanced by
utilizing unavailable near-infrared light. It is important that the
higher photon energy is obtained due to the harvest dense energy,
i.e., low entropy, and utilize the energy after transforming its type
adapted to the situation.4 The photon upconverted
emission based on the dye-sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation
(TTA-UC) was investigated to convert a longer-wavelength light to
a shorter-wavelength one having higher energy.5−7 This technique
can be performed using certain organic molecules during irradiation
by a noncoherent light source instead of laser light. Such functional
molecules should be concentrated and immobilized on/in the solid particles/matrices
to efficiently induce their energy transfer and practically utilize
the energy.7−15

TTA-UC has been observed in the systems containing Pt(II)
octaethylporphyrin
(PtOEP, triplet sensitizer) and 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA, singlet
emitter).4−12,16−20 During this process, the triplet sensitizer molecules
should not interact with each other because their aggregates act as
an energy trap,8−11,16,20 whereas the triplet sensitizer molecules should sensitize the emitter
molecules to the triplet states and the resulting triplet molecules
should interact with each other to be the emitter molecules in the
singlet excited states. It has been reported that organic dye molecules
can be separately encapsulated in the silica gel pores or silica network
by the sol–gel method.21−24 It was postulated that the gel consists of amorphous,
nanosized, and highly porous particle-like units (hereinafter called
“particles”). The apparent specific surface area of
the silica gel similar to the present samples was ca. 1000 m2 g–1.25 The silica gel
had a hydrophilic surface due to the presence of one OH group per
surface silicon atom. The rhodamine dyes encapsulated in the silica
reached high concentrations without any undesirable dye aggregations
during the sol–gel transition.24 The unique behavior of the molecules encapsulated in the silica
gel is expected to produce their potential function. On the other
hand, the molecule adsorption on the silica gels leads to aggregate
formation on the surface.26−28

In this study, TTA-UC was
attempted to be observed in the sol–gel
silica systems containing PtOEP (triplet sensitizer) and DPA (singlet
emitter). The triplet sensitizer was encapsulated and highly dispersed
in the silica gels prepared by the sol–gel method. Therefore,
the sensitizer molecules cannot easily interact with each other for
their energy exchange. The singlet emitter was adsorbed from its toluene
solution on the surface and pores of the silica gel particles accessible
to the outside. Some of the encapsulated sensitizer molecules are
expected to be close to the emitter molecules and interact with them.
The emitter molecules can interact with each other. A schematic diagram
of the interaction is shown in Scheme 1. The emission and excitation spectra of the moderately
and thoroughly dried silica gel samples were observed using a fluorescence
spectrophotometer to examine the influence of the solvents remaining
in the gels on the emission process. The dependences of the emission
peak intensities on the emitter concentration and irradiation light
intensity were examined.

Results and Discussion
Phosphorescence Quenching
of the Triplet Sensitizer
The absorbance depicted in the
UV–vis absorption spectra of
the PtOEP and DPA solutions dispersing the silica gel powder samples
decreased with an increase in time due to their adsorption on the
silica particles. These adsorption data were fitted to a Langmuir
model. Figure S1 shows the Langmuir isotherms
of the PtOEP and DPA adsorption on the silica gel particles. Table S1 shows the fitting parameters (adsorption
equilibrium constants, Kad, and adsorption
capacities, Qmax) of the isotherms. On
the other hand, the absorbance of PtOEP in the DPA solutions slightly
increased, whereas the PtOEP-encapsulated gel samples were immersed
in the solutions due to the desorption of the weakly adsorbed PtOEP.
The amount of the desorbed PtOEP at 48 h was ca. 10% of the initial
amount in the silica gels.

Figure 1 shows the UV–vis diffuse reflection,
excitation, and emission spectra of the triplet sensitizer, PtOEP,
adsorbed on the surface of the silica gel particles and encapsulated
in the silica gel networks, and the singlet emitter, DPA, adsorbed
on the surface of the silica gel particles. The silica gel samples
adsorbing PtOEP and DPA were prepared by immersing in the toluene
solutions containing 60.0 μmol dm–3 (for emission
measurements) and 0.300 mmol dm–3 (for diffuse reflection
measurement) PtOEP and 20.0 mmol dm–3 DPA for 48
h separately. The diffuse reflection spectrum of the silica gel adsorbing
PtOEP at 450–600 nm was broader than that of the silica gel
encapsulating PtOEP, which was similar to the spectra in solvents.
There is a possibility for the formation of higher amounts of the
aggregates on the surface of the silica gel particles.30,31 The emission spectra of PtOEP and DPA indicated their phosphorescence
and fluorescence, respectively. The phosphorescence of PtOEP adsorbed
on the surface of the silica gel particles and encapsulated in the
silica gel networks was observed at room temperature. The phosphorescence
peak was located at 645 nm. The excitation spectral peak at 535 nm
originated from the sensitizer absorption.8−12,16−20 The emission intensity of the PtOEP encapsulated in the silica gel
networks was stronger than that adsorbed on the surface of the silica
gel particles, although their concentrations were nearly equal (ca.
0.3 μmol g–1). This indicated that the molecular
encapsulation efficiently shielded the molecules from oxygen molecules
and enhanced their emission.32,33 In addition, the high
dispersion of the molecules suppressed the interaction between the
molecules (aggregation), which caused their deactivating energy transfer.8−11,16,20 The emission peak was located at 430 nm in the gels adsorbing the
DPA. The related excitation peak at 375 nm originated from the DPA
absorption.8−12,16−20

on the surface of the silica gel particles and (2) encapsulated in
the silica gel networks and DPA (3) adsorbed on the surface of the
silica gel particles. (b) Excitation and emission spectra of the PtOEP
(1) adsorbed on the surface of the silica gel particles and (2) encapsulated

Figure S2 shows the emission decay curves
of the PtOEP adsorbed on the surface of the silica gel particles and
encapsulated in the silica gel networks. The decay curves were well
fitted to a double exponential function. The fitting parameters of
the emission decay curves are shown in Table S2. The shorter lifetime was much shorter than the values reported
as the phosphorescence lifetime in similar systems8−10 and can be
assigned to the deactivating energy transfer process due to the PtOEP
aggregates. The longer lifetime was assigned to the relatively stable
states causing the phosphorescence process. The lifetime values and
their fractions were higher for the encapsulated state than for the
adsorbed state. The activated-state stability was somewhat improved
by encapsulating in the silica gels. The molecular encapsulation more
efficiently shielded the molecules from oxygen molecules than the
molecular adsorption. The encapsulated PtOEP molecules can more strongly
interact with the DPA molecules adsorbed on the silica gel surface
than with the atmospheric oxygen molecules. The phosphorescence lifetimes
of PtOEP in the as-prepared and deaerated toluene solutions were reported
to be 0.2 and 50 μs, respectively, indicating that the oxygen
molecules quenched the phosphorescence.31 The lifetime observed in the present samples was shorter than that
observed in the deaerated toluene solution. Therefore, some of the
oxygen molecules on the surface still quenched the phosphorescence
of the PtOEP encapsulated in the silica gels. This should be one of
the factors lowering the emission efficiency.

Figure 2 shows the
dependence of the phosphorescence spectrum on the DPA concentration
in the silica gel samples adsorbing and encapsulating PtOEP. The PtOEP
and DPA adsorption on the silica gel was conducted by immersing in
toluene solutions containing 60.0 μmol dm–3 PtOEP and 5.0–20.0 mmol dm–3 DPA for 48
h. The concentration ranges of the adsorbed DPA were 75–220
and 94–340 μmol g–1 in the samples
adsorbing and encapsulating PtOEP, respectively. The phosphorescence
intensity of the PtOEP encapsulated in the silica gel without DPA
was higher than that of the PtOEP adsorbed on the silica gel without
DPA, although their concentrations were nearly equal to 0.3 μmol
g–1. The PtOEP concentration in these samples did
not depend on the DPA concentration. The phosphorescence of PtOEP
was gradually quenched with an increase in the concentration of DPA. Figure 3 shows the Stern–Volmer
plot for the phosphorescence quenching in the samples. The y-axis indicates the ratio of the phosphorescence intensity
observed without the singlet emitter (quencher, Q), Iem, to that observed with each concentration
of the adsorbed quencher, Iem0, i.e., Iem0/Iem = 1 + KSV[Q]. KSV is a quenching constant. The result indicated that
the gels contained low amounts of solvent molecules, such as toluene,
ethanol, and water, in which the triplet sensitizer should collide
with the singlet emitter in the excited-state lifetime of the triplet
sensitizer. The phosphorescence quenching behavior indicated that
the triplet sensitizer and singlet emitter molecules were in an environment
similar to the solvents.5,6 The solvent molecules
should be in the silica gel networks and on the surface of the silica
particles. The phosphorescence quenching constant, KSV, of the PtOEP molecules encapsulated in the gel (5.8
× 103 g mol–1) was higher than that
adsorbed on the silica gel (2.5 × 103 g mol–1). The encapsulated PtOEP molecules can more efficiently collide
with the absorbed DPA molecules than the adsorbed PtOEP molecules
in the present systems, which can induce their triplet-state quenching.
It has been reported that certain organic molecules encapsulated in
the silica gels transformed their structures during light irradiation
as photochromic reactions.34,35 The encapsulated PtOEP
molecules were presumed to be close to the adsorbed DPA molecules
for energy transfer of the electron-exchange mechanism.

Figure 2 Dependence
of the phosphorescence spectrum of PtOEP on the DPA
concentration in (a) silica gel samples adsorbing PtOEP and DPA and
(b) those encapsulating PtOEP and adsorbing DPA. The DPA was adsorbed
from the toluene solutions containing (1) 0 mmol dm–3, (2) 5.0 mmol dm–3, (3) 10.0 mmol dm–3, and (4) 20.0 mmol dm–3 DPA. The phosphorescence
spectra were observed upon 535 nm excitation.

silica gel samples adsorbing PtOEP and DPA and (2) those encapsulating
PtOEP and adsorbing DPA.

Photon Upconverted Emission of the Singlet Emitter
Figure 4 shows the
excitation and emission spectra of the silica gel sample containing
PtOEP and DPA. The emission peak was located at 430 nm in the silica
gel samples adsorbing and encapsulating the PtOEP. The related excitation
peak at 535 nm originated from the sensitizer absorption. The singlet
emission was enhanced when the phosphorescence was quenched with an
increase in the concentration of the singlet emitter.4−12,16−20 No emission was observed in the silica gel sample
adsorbing only DPA upon 535 nm excitation. Figures 5 and 6 show the dependence
of the DPA emission spectrum and intensity, respectively, on the DPA
concentration in the silica gel samples adsorbing and encapsulating
the PtOEP. The relative quantum efficiency of the emission is shown
in Figure S3. This result indicated that
photon upconverted emission was observed in the silica gel systems.
However, the emission efficiency was not high, due to the linear relationship
between the DPA emission intensity and the DPA concentration. The
emission should be a two-photon process. The triplet–triplet
annihilation of the DPA molecules did not efficiently occur. The reason
for this is presumed that the average distance of the triplet DPA
molecules produced by the PtOEP sensitization was far from their diffusing
distance to collide with each other in their triplet lifetime. There
is only a slight possibility of back energy transfer from the DPA
to PtOEP because the excited-state lifetime of the DPA, at most several
nanoseconds,8−10 is shorter than that of the PtOEP, at least 20 ns,
as shown in Table S2. The photon upconversion
efficiency should depend on the PtOEP concentration, which was necessarily
lower than that of the DPA under the present conditions. The slopes
were higher in the silica gel encapsulating the PtOEP than in that
adsorbing the PtOEP. This depended on the effective PtOEP molecules
without the deactivating energy transfer.

containing (1) 0 mmol dm–3, (2) 5.0 mmol dm–3, (3) 10.0 mmol dm–3, and (4) 20.0
mmol dm–3 DPA. The emission spectra were observed
upon 535 nm excitation.

Figure 7 shows
the
dependence of the DPA emission intensity on the irradiation power
density, i.e., excitation light intensity, in the silica gel samples
adsorbing and encapsulating the PtOEP. The graphs of the logarithmic
axes are also shown. The slope values for the silica gel samples adsorbing
and encapsulating the PtOEP were 2.1 and 2.0, respectively. Therefore,
the emission intensity proportionally increased to the approximate
square of the irradiation power, indicating that the emission was
a quasi-two-photon process.9,10,17,18 The energy transfer from some
of the encapsulated molecules to the adsorbed molecules and the TTA-UC
were observed in the present silica gels.

emission intensity on the excitation

Influence of Solvents on Photon Upconverted
Emission of the
Singlet Emitter
The adsorption of the PtOEP-encapsulated
silica gel for DPA was conducted by immersion in toluene solutions
containing 5.0–20.0 mmol dm–3 DPA for 6 h.
The phosphorescence intensity depended on the DPA concentration in
the PtOEP-encapsulated silica gel samples dried at 25 and 60 °C.
The PtOEP concentration in these samples was 0.28 ± 0.02 μmol
g–1, independent of the DPA concentration. The concentration
range of the adsorbed DPA was 60.0–220 μmol g–1 in the samples. Figure S4 shows the thermogravimetric
and differential thermal analyses (TG-DTA) curves of the silica gel
samples dried at 25 and 60 °C. Almost all of the solvents were
evaporated below 150 °C due to the weight losses and endothermic
peaks. The amounts of the solvents remaining in the gels dried at
25 and 60 °C were estimated to be 8 and 4 wt % of the gels, respectively.
The phosphorescence of PtOEP was gradually quenched with an increase
in the concentration of DPA in the wetter gel. On the other hand,
the phosphorescence was slightly quenched in the drier gel. Figure 8 shows the Stern–Volmer
plot for the phosphorescence quenching in the samples dried at 25
and 60 °C. The phosphorescence quenching constants, KSV, in the wetter and dryer gels were 4.4 and 1.2 ×
103 g mol–1, respectively. This indicated
that the phosphorescence quenching more efficiently occurred in the
wetter gels than in the dryer gels as expected.

for the phosphorescence quenching of samples
dried at (1) 25 °C and (2) 60 °C.

Figure 9 shows
the
dependence of the DPA emission intensity on the DPA concentration
in the wetter and dryer silica gel samples encapsulating the PtOEP.
The relative quantum efficiency of the emission is shown in Figure S5. This result indicated that the photon
upconverted emission was observed in the silica gel systems. As the
amounts of the solvents remaining in the wetter gel were twice as
high as those in the dryer gel, the emission quantum efficiency of
the former was 4 times higher than that of the latter. However, the
emission efficiency was not high based on the linear relationship
between the DPA emission intensity and the DPA concentration, although
the emission should be a two-photon process. The triplet–triplet
annihilation of the DPA molecules did not efficiently occur because
the average distance of the triplet DPA molecules was far from their
diffusing distance to collide with each other in their triplet lifetime,
similar to the above-mentioned systems. The slopes were higher in
the wetter gel than in the dryer gel.

Figure 9 Dependence of upconverted emission intensity
of DPA on the DPA
concentration of samples dried at (1) 25 °C and (2) 60 °C.

Figure 10 shows
the dependence of the DPA emission intensity on the irradiation power
in the wetter and dryer silica gel samples encapsulating PtOEP. The
graphs of the logarithmic axes are also shown. The slope values for
the wetter and dryer gels were 2.4 and 2.6, respectively. Therefore,
the emission can be regarded as a quasi-two-photon process in the
wetter silica gels. The energy transfer from some of the encapsulated
molecules to the adsorbed molecules and the TTA-UC were observed in
the present silica gels containing low amounts of the solvent molecules
such as toluene, ethanol, and water. The energy transfer process for
the triplet sensitization and triplet–triplet annihilation
process required the collision of the component molecules in an environment
similar to the solvents during their activated-state lifetime.

Figure 10 Dependence
of the singlet emission intensity on the excitation
light intensity in (1) wetter and (2) dryer silica gel systems containing
PtOEP and DPA.

Finally, Figure S6 shows the phosphorescence
decay curves of the wetter silica gel sample encapsulating PtOEP and
that encapsulating PtOEP and adsorbing DPA, as well as the emission
rise and decay curve of that encapsulating PtOEP and adsorbing DPA.
The decay components were well fitted to a double exponential function.
The fitting parameters of the emission time profiles are shown in Table S3. The phosphorescence lifetime values
were shorter in the DPA-containing sample than in the DPA-free sample
due to the quenching energy transfer. The rise time of the emission
was nearly equal to the average of the shorter and longer lifetime
values of the phosphorescence in the DPA-containing sample. The photon
upconverted emission based on the dye-sensitized triplet–triplet
annihilation was clearly observed in the silica sol–gel system,
although its efficiency was not very high.

Conclusions
TTA-UC
was observed in the sol–gel silica systems containing
PtOEP (triplet sensitizer) and DPA (singlet emitter). The triplet
sensitizer was encapsulated and highly dispersed in the silica gels
prepared by the sol–gel method. The singlet emitter was adsorbed
from its toluene solution on the silica gel pores accessible to the
outside. The emission and excitation spectra of the moderately and
thoroughly dried silica gel samples were observed. The encapsulated
triplet sensitizer emitted phosphorescence more efficiently than the
sensitizer adsorbed on the silica gel pores due to the low deactivating
energy transfer. Dependences of the emission peak intensities on the
emitter concentration and irradiation light intensity were evaluated.
The phosphorescence was quenched, and the singlet emission was enhanced
with an increase in the concentration of the singlet emitter. The
emission intensity proportionally increased to the approximate square
of the irradiation power. The energy transfer from some of the encapsulated
molecules to the adsorbed molecules and the TTA-UC were consequently
observed in the present silica gels. The phosphorescence quenching
and TTA-UC were more significantly observed in the wetter gel than
in the dryer gel. The wetter gel contained higher amounts of solvent
and water molecules, in which the triplet sensitization and TTA processes
proceeded during the triplet-state lifetime. These processes required
that the sensitizer and singlet emitter molecules were in an environment
similar to the solvents for the collision of the components. Silica
gel containing much higher amounts of solvent molecules in the gel
networks and on the surface of the particles promises to lead to a
much higher efficiency of the TTA-UC.

Experimental Section
Sample
Preparation
PtOEP (Sigma-Aldrich), DPA, ethanol,
hydrochloric acid, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and toluene (Wako
Chemicals, S grade) were used without further purification. The water
was deionized and distilled using a Yamato WG23 distiller.

PtOEP
was dissolved in ethanol at 0.100 mmol dm–3 for
the sol–gel reaction. The starting solution of the sol–gel
system contained 5.25 cm3 of PtOEP in an ethanol solution,
5.00 cm3 of TEOS, and 1.65 cm3 of 1.00 mmol
dm–3 hydrochloric acid as the catalyst. The system
without PtOEP was also prepared. The solutions were stirred during
the addition, thoroughly stirred for an additional 5 min, and then
poured into individual polypropylene vials (50 cm3). The
vials were closed with a holed cover and kept in a thermostated oven
at 60 °C for 3 days. The resulting gel samples were ground in
mortars.

The silica gel samples without PtOEP (0.100 g) were
immersed in
a toluene solution containing 0.300 mmol dm–3 PtOEP
and 20.0 mmol dm–3 DPA for 1–6 and 48 h or
in toluene solutions containing 60.0 μmol dm–3 PtOEP and 5.0–20.0 mmol dm–3 DPA for 48
h to adsorb the PtOEP and DPA. The PtOEP-encapsulated samples (0.100
g) were immersed in a toluene solution of 20 mmol dm–3 DPA for 1–6 h or in toluene solutions of 5.0–20.0
mmol dm–3 DPA for 48 h to adsorb the DPA. The two-way
preparations provided nearly the same amount of PtOEP molecules encapsulated
in the silica gels or adsorbed on the surface and pores of the silica
gel particles (ca. 0.3 μmol g–1, 1.8 ×
10–4 nm–2 on the suppose of the
specific surface area, 1000 m2 g–1 25). These samples were dried at 25 °C
for 1 day. The other PtOEP-encapsulated samples (0.100 g) were immersed
in toluene solutions of 5.0–20.0 mmol dm–3 DPA for 6 h. These samples were dried at 25 and 60 °C for 1
day to examine the influence of the remaining solvents.

Measurements
The UV–vis absorption spectra and
emission spectra were observed using a Shimadzu UV-3150 spectrophotometer
and a Shimadzu RF-5300 fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively.
A sharp cut filter was used during the excitation for the emission
spectral measurements to cut light with a wavelength shorter than
the excitation wavelength, such as the second-order light. The powder
samples were diluted with barium sulfate (Wako Chemicals, 1st grade)
for the diffuse reflection spectroscopy using the UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The powder samples (20.0 mg) were placed between two glass plates
with a window area of 1.5 cm2 to observe their emission
spectra. The relative emission quantum efficiency was estimated using
the absorption and emission intensities of the samples compared to
those of an ethanol solution of 1.00 μmol dm–3 DPA.29 The irradiation light power was
changed by neutral-density filters and measured using a Coherent LabMaX-TOP
laser power/energy meter.

Thermogravimetric and differential
thermal analyses (TG-DTA) of the silica gel samples dried at 25 and
60 °C were conducted using a Rigaku Thermo Plus EVOII TG8120
thermal analyzer.

The emission decay curves were measured using
a time-correlated
single photon counting system. The samples were excited using a green
light-emitting diode (LED) (Toyoda Gosei E1L51-3GC02) as pulse light
source with a peak wavelength at 525 nm. The detection of single photons
was conducted using a process memory (NAIG E-562), an analog-to-digital
converter (NAIG E-551), a time-to-amplitude converter (Canberra model
2043), a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R3896), and a monochromator (Bunkoukeiki
MC-25). The green LED was driven by a self-made pulse generator. The
curves were analyzed by applying an iterative reconvolution of the
instrument response function with an exponential decay model.
