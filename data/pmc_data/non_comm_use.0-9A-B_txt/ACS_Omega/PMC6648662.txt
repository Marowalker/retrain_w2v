Obtaining
molecular information from inside cells is an important
topic to understand the outcome of molecular interactions between
potential drug molecules and biomolecules inside cells. To envision
this goal, we investigated the surface-enhanced Raman scattering-based
single-cell spectroscopic method to monitor changes in intracellular
molecular signatures during mitochondrially mediated apoptosis in
real time. Triphenylphosphine-modified gold nanoparticles were localized
successfully to the mitochondria and greatly enhanced to obtain the
intrinsic Raman scattering spectrum of mitochondria and cytochrome c in the live cell. Photothermally induced apoptosis showed
a moderate decrease in the disulfide bond and a sharp increase in
β-sheet structures depending on the input-laser power, along
with morphological changes. However, chemical drug induced-apoptosis
showed more subtle changes in the disulfide bond, as well as changes
in Raman peaks corresponding to cytochrome c, and
the appearance of a new peak at 1420 cm–1, which
enabled us to study the molecular interactions within the mitochondria
in real time from a single cell, following treatment with a novel
pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor.

Introduction
The development of
cell biology strongly relied on fluorescence-based
microscopy, which uses organic fluorescent molecules, fluorescent
proteins,1 or quantum dots to monitor cellular
functions,2 morphology, and the expression
levels of specific markers.1,2 Raman scattering is
a promising technology for use in label-free biological imaging applications
because of its intrinsic ability to obtain spectroscopic information
of interest without interference from water molecules.3−5 Unfortunately, the main limitations of Raman scattering are its
extremely low signal intensity, which requires the use of a special
optical system for label-free imaging.5,6 Another way
to overcome this limitation of Raman scattering is to use the strong
ability of gold or silver nanoparticles to plasmonically enhance the
Raman scattering, which has greatly improved the ability to detect
and obtain molecular information in single living cells.7−12 Recently, Austin et al., demonstrated the use of plasmonically enhanced
Raman scattering-based single cell imaging spectroscopy to demonstrate
the effect of an anticancer drug using nuclear-targeted gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs).13 The same group also demonstrated
the capability of plasmonically enhanced Raman scattering to monitor
the entire cell cycle, showing changes in the bands around 511, 658,
844, and 1322 cm–1, corresponding to the −S–S–
vibration, guanine, sugar–phosphate and adenine, and guanine
and RNA, respectively.14,15 Both studies used nuclear-targeting
of AuNPs to monitor molecular changes occurring inside a single cell.
Systemic studies for other important subcellular organelles, such
as mitochondria, will also require the use of this Raman-based single
cell spectroscopic technology, for example, to study the interaction
of novel drug molecules with mitochondria. Mitochondria are the power
plants of the cell and play a central role in metabolic tasks and
cellular proliferation regulation. The damage and subsequent dysfunction
in mitochondria is an important factor in a range of human diseases.16−18 There are currently a large number of anticancer drug molecules
that have been developed, or are under development, that can target
the mitochondria through a diverse array of mechanisms.16−18 In this study, we focused on the spectroscopic analysis of the molecular
signal changes that occur in the mitochondria during either photothermally
or chemically induced apoptosis (Figure 1). To generate plasmonically enhanced Raman
scattering in mitochondria, we used mitochondrially targeted AuNPs.
For cellular imaging, the use of AuNPs instead of silver nanoparticles
provides substantial benefits because of their excellent biocompatibility
and strong plasmonic enhancement using near-infrared light (785 nm),
which enabled us to avoid the high autofluorescence background often
found in cell imaging studies.19

targeting of AuNPs (TPP-AuNPs) and the use of single cell Raman-based
spectroscopic analysis for mitochondria mediated apoptosis induced
either photothermally or chemically.

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization of the Triphenylphosphine-AuNPs
We selected triphenylphosphine (TPP) as the ligand for mitochondria
targeting.20,21 To prepare TPP-modified AuNPs
(TPP-AuNPs), 1 μL of TPP solution in dimethylformamide (0.1
mg/10 mL) was added to 1 mL of tannic acid modified AuNPs (TA-AuNPs,
50 nm). After shaking for 2 h at room temperature, the solution was
centrifuged at 3400 rcf for 15 min. Following this, the precipitate
was redispersed in distilled water (1 mL). Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), UV–vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and zeta potential
analysis all demonstrated the successful modification of TA-AuNPs
into TPP-AuNPs, as shown in Figure 2. The TPP-AuNPs were well dispersed in distilled water
as shown by the TEM and UV–visible spectra (Figure 2A,B). The Raman spectroscopy
analysis confirmed the change in the surface state of the TPP-AuNPs
compared to the TA-AuNPs. The TA-AuNPs showed no noticeable Raman
spectrum (black line in Figure 2C), but TPP-AuNPs (red line) showed a noticeable Raman spectrum
originating from the TPP molecule. Because of TPP binding to the AuNPs
via the Au–P bond, the Raman spectrum of the TPP-AuNPs was
different from that of the TPP powder. The TPP powder showed an intense
Raman peak at 1000 cm–1 which can be ascribed to
an in-plane C–C–C angle deformation vibration for the
phenyl rings in TPP,22 but this peak intensity
at 1000 cm–1 was significantly decreased in the
case of the TPP-AuNPs (Figure 2C).

Figure 2 (A) TEM images [TA-AuNP, TPP-AuNP solution (inset)], (B) UV–visible
spectrum, (C) Raman spectra, and (D) zeta potential analysis of TA-AuNPs
and TPP-AuNPs.

The zeta potential analysis
showed the change in the surface charge
as a result of the TPP modification. The TA-AuNPs had a strong negative
surface charge (−50.01 mV) at neutral pH, but upon changing
TA to TPP, the TPP-AuNPs showed a more positive surface charge (−30.04
mV). At a low pH (pH 2.3), the TPP-AuNPs showed a positive surface
zeta potential indicating the successful modification of the TA-AuNPs
with TPP molecules (Figure 2D).23

Analysis of Intracellular
Distribution of TPP-AuNPs
To evaluate the mitochondria-targeting
capability of the TPP-AuNPs,
TPP-AuNPs (0.1 nM) and TA-AuNPs (0.1 nM) were incubated with HSC-3
cells, and then the particle distribution inside the cells was monitored
using bright-field (B/F) and dark-field (D/F) microscopy. Figure S1 shows the time-dependent particle uptake
efficiency. Although the TPP-AuNPs were not efficiently internalized
at an early time point (3 h), the TPP-AuNPs were well internalized
into the HSC-3 cells after 6 h. Based on this result, we set the incubation
time as 6 h to allow the TPP-AuNPs sufficient time to localize to
the mitochondria. More importantly, in order to obtain molecular signals
derived from the mitochondria, the exact localization of the plasmonic
nanoparticles into the mitochondria is critical. To further examine
this, we compared the distribution of TA-AuNPs and TPP-AuNPs in a
single cell with B/F and D/F microscopy, single cell Raman imaging,
and a spectrum analysis (Figure 3A,B for TA-AuNPs, 3C,D for TPP-AuNPs).
The cells were stained with a mito-tracker to examine the distribution
of particles within the mitochondria [Figure 3A(iv),C(iv)]. The fluorescence images were
partially matched with the distribution of the nanoparticles observed
in the B/F and D/F images. It is expected that TA-AuNPs would randomly
distribute themselves in the cytosol but that TPP-AuNPs would distribute
themselves in the mitochondria. The B/F and D/F images shown in Figure 3A(i,ii),C(i,ii) provide
information on the distribution of particles inside the cell. Because
of the plasmonically enhanced Raman signal, high speed, single cell
Raman imaging was possible, as shown in Figure 3A(iii),C(iii). It took 3.3 min to obtain
single cell Raman images with a 30 ms exposure time per pixel (70
× 70 pixel) and a 2.98 mW/cm2 input laser power (785
nm). Interestingly, the Raman spectra obtained from the cells incubated
with the TA-AuNPs were not identical to each other because of a protein
corona that formed around the TA-AuNPs and their random distribution
in the cytosol [Figure 3B, Raman spectra obtained from the points 1, 2, and 3 in Figure 3A(iii)].24 However, the Raman spectra of the cells incubated
with TPP-AuNPs showed an almost identical spectra to each other [Figure 3D, Raman spectra
obtained from the points 1, 2, and 3 in Figure 3C(iii)]. The spectra displayed in Figure 3D were not identical
to that of TPP-AuNPs (Figure 2C). Even though the intrinsic Raman spectra of TPP-AuNPs can
induce an interference in obtaining the Raman spectrum of molecules
from inside cells, the spectra displayed in Figure 3D showed no significant difficulty in analyzing
the Raman spectrum as following. The Raman shift peaks located at
505, 840, and 1000 cm–1 were assigned to the −S–S–
stretching vibration,13 symmetrical lipid
−O–C–C–N– stretches and tyrosine,15 and a benzene ring stretching vibration (phenyl
alanine),25 respectively. The Raman shift
peaks located at 750, 1127, 1313, and 1581 cm–1 were
assigned to the vibrational modes typical for cytochrome c (Cyt C),26,27 (Figure 3D). In the case of Hela cells, Raman scattering
at 750 and 1581 cm–1, which were assigned to the
pyrrole breathing modes in Cyt C, were clearly observed
in a label-free Raman analysis, but the current in situ surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS)-based analysis showed a relatively small Raman
scattering intensity at 750 cm–1.27 The difference can be expected from the difference of the
Raman scattering mechanism between the normal Raman scattering and
SERS mechanism. The Raman shift peaks located at 1225 cm–1 were assigned to the amide III vibrational mode of β-sheets.15 The same Raman spectral patterns were observed
from other types of cells (human fibroblast cell, data not shown here).
Therefore, it is believed that the Raman spectra displayed in Figure 3D were close to the
Raman spectra of Cyt C in the mitochondria of a cell
(see Supporting Information Table S1 for
detailed assignment).

Time-Dependent Changes
during Photothermally Induced Apoptosis
Based on these Raman
spectra (Figure 3D)
as a starting point, we followed the changes
in the molecular signal during apoptosis induced by either photothermal
(PTT) damage or by drug molecules that would be expected to interact
with the kinases present in the mitochondria. First, we followed the
Raman signal changes over time after applying a focused 785 nm laser
for 1 s with different input-laser powers (0, 12, and 24 mW) to a
single cell. The input-laser power was focused on the area inside
cells through a 60× objective lens, and then acquired the Raman
signal changes using the same objective lens. Figure 4A shows that there were significant changes
in the cell morphology using both B/F microscopy, D/F microscopy,
and Raman imaging 30 min after exposure to a high input laser (24
mW), indicating that the cell was undergoing apoptosis. Figure 4B shows typical changes in
the Raman spectra at 5 min intervals during apoptosis (24 mW). The
disulfide Raman peak at 505 cm–1 slowly decreased
with time because of the reduction of disulfide residues of protein
by glutathione, which is one of the defense mechanisms that occurs
following cell stress.28 The Raman peak
at 840 cm–1 was relatively unchanged over time.
The Raman peak related to Cyt C at 1127 cm–1 did not change significantly. However, the Raman shift corresponding
to β-sheets (1225 cm–1), and the Raman shift
at 1585 cm–1 significantly increased after 20 min,
as shown in Figure 4B. This is because of significant structural changes in proteins
present in the mitochondria as a result of hyperthermia-induced apoptosis.
The moderate decrease in the disulfide bond at 505 cm–1 agrees well with previously reported results, where HSC-3 cells
laden with nuclear targeted AuNPs were induced to undergo apoptosis
following light illumination.15 The appearance
of the amide IIIβ-sheet Raman shift at 1225 cm–1 is related to the significant changes in the α-helical structure
of proteins (1300–1400 cm–1).

induced apoptosis in HSC-3 cells (785 nm,

shifts at 505 cm–1 (−S–S−),
1127 cm–1 (Cyt C), 1225 cm–1 (β-sheet), and 1585 cm–1 (pyrrole
ring) after applying with 0, 12, and 24 mW laser illumination.

These spectral changes were found
to be clearly correlated with
the input laser power, as shown in Figures 4C & S2. If
there was no photothermal damage to the cells, the Raman shifts were
not changed significantly (Figures 4C-0 mW & S2A). However,
when stronger photothermal damage was applied to the cell, more significant
changes in the Raman signal intensity were observed over time (Figures 4C and S2B-12 mW, 24 mW). Much faster and clearer intensity
changes were observed at high input laser powers [Figure 4C (12 vs 24 mW)]. Therefore,
it is believed that Raman-based single cell spectroscopy is a promising
way to monitor the molecular signal changes inside cells.

Time-Dependent
Changes during Dichloroacetate Induced Apoptosis
Next, we
monitored the molecular signal changes during apoptosis
induced by a chemical drug molecule such as dichloroacetate (DCA)
sodium, which is a well-known inhibitor of phosphate dehydrogenase
kinase (PDHK) that is located in the mitochondrial matrix.29−31 The LC50 for DCA in HSC-3 cells was determined to be
500 mM, as determined by a cell viability assay (Figure S3).32 Based on this, we
investigated the effect of different DCA concentrations (5, 50, and
500 mM) on HSC-3 cells using Raman scattering. Figure 5A shows the changes in the single cell morphology
induced by the addition of DCA (500 mM). Compared to PTT-induced apoptosis,
the apoptotic cell morphology changes caused by DCA were not clearly
evident, even after 30 min. However, the Raman spectra were found
to change significantly, as shown in Figure 5B. The disulfide peak at 505 cm–1 disappeared very rapidly, but the peak at 840 cm–1 was unchanged, both of which were observed for PTT-induced apoptosis
(Figure 5B). The Raman
shift at 1127 cm–1 changed significantly, splitting
into two peaks (1116 and 1141 cm–1). The Raman shift
at 1313 cm–1 also changed significantly decreasing
in intensity after 10 min. As the Raman scattering at 1313 cm– decreased further after 15 min, a new peak at 1420
cm–1, corresponding to the −CH2 bending mode for proteins and lipids, was observed. Because the
addition of DCA does not induce physical damage inside the cell, there
were no significant increases in the amide IIIβ-sheet Raman
shift at 1225 cm–1. Time-dependent monitoring of
the peaks at 505, 1127, 1225, and 1585 cm–1 showed
DCA concentration dependent changes, as shown in Figure 5C. At a low DCA concentration
(5 mM), the Raman scattering at 505 cm–1 was not
significantly changed, but small changes in the Raman shift at 1127
cm–1, corresponding to Cyt C, were
observed (Figures 5C & S4A). When the DCA concentration
was increased to 50 mM, the Raman peaks at 505 and 1127 cm–1 showed a more significant decrease with time compared to at low
DCA concentration. At 500 mM DCA, the Raman peaks at 505 and 1127
cm–1 changed very rapidly (Figures 5C & S4B) and
a new peak at 1420 cm–1 was observed, which indicates
a significant change in the intracellular environment, Cyt C, and the membrane structures of the mitochondria.

5, 50, and 500 mM DCA.

Time-Dependent Changes during Potential Inhibitor Induced Apoptosis
Both results in Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate the strong capability
of single cell Raman spectroscopy to monitor molecular changes in
the mitochondria. To further envision the capability of this method
to screen for potential drug molecules that can inhibit the mitochondrial
function, we performed the same experiment with a novel small molecule
inhibitor of PDHK (2,4-dihydroxy benzamide derivative to VER-246608),
which showed a strong potency in HSC-3 cells (Figure S5).30,33 The LC50 for the novel
PDHK inhibitor on HSC-3 cells was determined to be 0.4 mM (Figure S5).

Based on this, we investigated
molecular signal changes in mitochondria following the addition of
the novel PDHK inhibitor (50 μM, 500 μM, and 5 mM). Figure 6A shows the morphological
changes in HSC-3 cells after treatment with 5 mM of the novel PDHK
inhibitor. Although little changes were observed in the single cell
by B/F microscopy, D/F microscopy, and Raman mapping images, clear
changes in the Raman scattering spectra, could be observed, as shown
in Figure 6B. The disulfide
peak at 505 cm–1 decreased very rapidly after 10
min, but the peaks at 840 and 1000 cm–1 did not
change over time. Similar to DCA-induced apoptosis, the Raman scattering
peaks at 1127 and 1313 cm–1 showed a decreased intensity
with peak splitting. Unlike DCA-induced apoptosis, a new peak at 1420
cm–1 was not found in this case. Figure 6C shows the quantitative changes
in Raman scattering at 505 cm–1 (−S–S−),
1127 cm–1 (Cyt C), 1225 cm–1 (β-sheet), and 1585 cm–1 (pyrrole
ring) depending on the concentration the novel PDHK inhibitor (50
μM, 500 μM, and 5 mM). At the low concentration (50 μM),
the intensity of the disulfide peak at 505 cm–1 decreased
rapidly but recovered to the initial state after 10 min, indicating
the recovery of a healthy cell state. Although some small fluctuations
in the peak at 1125 cm–1 corresponding to Cyt C were observed, the peak intensity remained relatively
unchanged over time (Figures 6C & S6A). However, the Raman
scattering at higher concentrations of the novel PDHK inhibitor (500
μM and 5 mM) showed more significant changes over time (Figures 6C & S6B). The Raman signal at 505 cm–1 showed no recovery to its initial state at high inhibitor concentrations
(500 μM and 5 mM). Along with the change in the disulfide peak,
the Raman signals at 1127 and 1585 cm–1 were also
significantly decreased. It should be noted that these changes in
the Raman signals were sensitive enough to identify the molecular
signals during apoptosis, even before the morphological changes could
be identified in a single cell.

PDHK inhibitor.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have demonstrated the use of a single cell spectroscopic
tool that can monitor changes in molecular signals in mitochondria
during apoptosis using mitochondrially targeted plasmonic nanoparticles
(TPP-AuNPs) and Raman microscopy coupled with B/F microscopy, D/F
microscopy, and fluorescence imaging. Characteristic changes in the
Raman signals could be identified for both photothermally and chemically
induced apoptosis. The Raman scattering at 505 cm–1 can be used as an indicator of cellular homeostasis. The Raman scattering
at 840 cm–1 can be used as an internal standard
peak because its intensity does not change during apoptosis, regardless
of how the apoptosis was initiated. The intensity changes in the signature
peaks related to the Cyt C or β-sheet showed
a close dependence on the concentration of potential drugs or input
laser power, indicating that there is a strong potential for this
single cell Raman-based spectroscopic tool for use in future drug
screening applications.34−36
