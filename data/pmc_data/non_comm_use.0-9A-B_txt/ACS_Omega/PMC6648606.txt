Stimuli-responsive
behavior of lignin microcapsules (LMCs) has
been investigated along with the detailed characterization of their
stability profiles. The disassembly of LMCs was found to be salt species-dependent,
indicating the specific relevance of inherent kosmotropic and chaotropic
characteristics. For the first time, a connection between the Hofmeister
series and the stability profile of lignin microscale materials is
established. LMCs showed excellent stability in water and under high
temperature and pressure (autoclaving conditions). Active release
is efficiently triggered by pH changes and balancing chaotropic and
kosmotropic effects via salinity tuning.

Introduction
The microencapsulation technique, a concept
introduced by Chang
in the 1960s,1 can be defined as the process
by which one compound is coated with another compound.2,3 The coated component, or components in the case of mixtures of substances,
can be an active agent, such as pesticides, poorly soluble drugs,
flavors, or food additives.4−7

Nowadays, the microencapsulation process is
of significant interest
in academic and industrial research.6−14 Relevant investigations in microencapsulation have been performed
in the context of pharmaceutical and biomedical applications, such
as drug delivery, cell implantation, and gene therapy, as well as
applications in biotechnology such as fermentation and large-scale
cell culture involving a variety of materials and preparation technologies.12,15

The intended purpose of the microencapsulation is the relevant
criterion underlying the selection of the shell component.3,6 The suitable shell component must be chemically compatible with
the core material, to provide the desired coating properties, such
as strength, flexibility, permeability, optical properties, and stability.3 In this respect, lignins represent an interesting
option.

Almost one third of lignocellulosic biomass comprises
polyphenolic
oligomers and polymers, which are for the most part lignins.16−19 Lignins are naturally synthesized in vascular plants by the polymerization
of phenylpropane units; the resulting polymers are structurally complex
polyphenols. An even larger variety and diversity is caused by the
fact that different wood species, in combination with variable extraction
processes, result in different structural characteristics of available
lignin species20−23 (Figure 1). The valorization
of lignin waste streams from pulp and paper and modern biorefinery
processes is a crucial step for the development of a circular sustainable
economy.

Lignosulfonates (LSs) are produced
when biomass is pulped with
a metal sulfite and sulfur dioxide under acidic conditions. The resulting
LS fraction contains two types of ionizing groups: sulfonates (pKa ≤2) and phenolic hydroxyl groups (pKa ∼10). The physicochemical properties
of LSs are affected by the metal cation of the sulfite salt used during
the pulping process,24 that is, Na(I) or
Ca(II).

LSs are eco-friendly materials with a safety threshold
of 10 kg/m2, which is very much above the 1 kg/m2 required
for stabilization and the 0.3 kg/m2 used for dust control;
and residuals are resistant to decay.25 LSs possess a very low toxicity toward plants26 and aquatic animals.27 Additionally,
they are free of dioxins and other organics at hazardous levels, and
their toxic trace minerals are below the Extraction Procedure Toxicity
threshold according to United States Environmental Protection Agency.25,28 The usefulness of commercial lignosulfonate products comes from
their dispersing, binding, complexing, and emulsifying properties.29 The additive calcium lignosulfonate as described
in the Food Chemicals Codex30 has been
used for a number of years in the food industry,26 serving, for example, as an emulsifier in animal feed,
as a raw material in the production of vanillin, and as a boiler water
additive.29

Other types of isolated
lignins such as softwood kraft lignin (SKL)
are also commercially available. SKL, in particular, is cost-effective
as well as available in industrial quantities22 and displays numerous beneficial properties as an LS.10,16,31,32Figure 1 shows exemplary
structural representations of these two lignins. Depending on the
targeted field of use, SKL might represent a valid alternative for
the use of LSs.

Several studies demonstrated that lignins have
useful rheological
and viscoelastic properties to develop a structural material,16,24,33 meaningful film forming ability,31,33,34 and compatibility with a wide
range of solvents.23,24,34 Lignins are multifunctional biopolymers that carry many aliphatic
hydroxyl and phenolic groups. Technical lignins additionally present
sulfonate groups (SLS) or increased phenolic group contents and concomitant
reduced contents of aliphatic chains (SKL). The abundance of different
functional groups allows in principle for a broad range of chemical
transformations16,23,24,35 that can serve both to control reactivity
in industrial applications10,16,31,32,36 and modify physicochemical parameters such as surface adhesion properties
or thermal stabilities. The presence of the aromatic functionality
naturally provides stability, good mechanical properties, and amphiphilic
characteristics. Lignins offer, in addition to the aforementioned
properties, other significant features such as aggregation properties,10,32,36 high biocompatibility, and ability
to absorb UV light.37 The intrinsic electronic
stacking and complexing properties, as well as the possibilities for
hydrophobic interactions, make lignins ideal matrixes for microencapsulation.14,38 Interactions among lignin oligomers were shown to be fundamental
for the generation of robust microcapsules via the sonochemical method.10,14

To be qualified for their potential applications, lignin microcapsules
(LMCs) have to possess some particular characteristics, including
a suitable stability and release profile at a specific site of interest
or upon a specific type of chemical or physical trigger.

The
present work was designed to achieve both, the development
of a novel type of stimuli-responsive lignosulfonate (LS) microcapsules
and a detailed mapping of their stability under various conditions
in comparison to kraft lignin (KL) microcapsules. These two selected
technical lignins, that is, a softwood-based lignosulfonate (SLS)
and a softwood-based kraft lignin (SKL), were chosen on the basis
of their significant difference in amphiphilic character and water
solubility.

A Machiavellian assessment of the stability of microcapsules
is
necessary in case one is really interested in developing such structures
for real-life applications with very different boundary conditions
and pre-set parameters. Once formed and characterized, the study of
stimuli-triggered LMC disassembly was thus realized using selected
physical and chemical conditions, screening effects of time, temperature,
pressure, pH, salinity, osmotic stress, physiologically important
molecules, surfactant and solvents. Our study aimed at delineating
interconnected effects, trying to determine which parameter, in case
there are multiple effects present, is the determining one, such as
to eventually get hints of how to alter basic LMCs to render them
more suitable in specific settings. To guarantee overall comparability
of the results, stability studies were performed in a very strictly
standardized fashion: LMCs were evaluated by default after being subjected
to test conditions for 24 or 48 h. The scope of this study was not
to evaluate the kinetics of a potential capsule degeneration but,
as a first step in LMC stability evaluation, to get a more universal
idea of how LMCs are affected by specific physicochemical conditions.
This study wants to lay the groundwork for eventual kinetic investigations
under specific conditions pre-set by targeted applications.

Results
and Discussion
Conceptual Approach to Microcapsule Generation
When
approaching the design of microcapsules, one has to take into consideration
key issues such as biocompatibility, stability, tendency to aggregate
– that is, stacking and complexing of the matrix – and
amphiphilicity. In this study, the objective was the generation of
biocompatible microcapsules. The choice of lignin as a possible matrix
was due to its significant antioxidant activity. Such an intrinsic
lignin property shows promising potential in protecting a sensitive
loaded active ingredient from oxidative stress and degradation. To
obtain robust lignin microcapsules, two lignins with different amphiphilicities,
water solubilities, and pH-related behaviors were selected: SLS, which
is rich in sulfonate and phenolic groups, and SKL, which is rich in
phenolic groups. According to a previously reported procedure, the
lignins were dissolved in water and, an oil-in-water emulsion was
generated and subjected to ultrasonication. In brief, LMCs have been
generated on a 1 mL scale from a 10:1 mixture of aqueous SKL solution
(0.5% w/v) and olive oil treated by ultrasonication at 40 W (10% amplitude)
for 40 s. The statistical quantitative analysis, using a combination
of microscopy and ImageJ-based analysis, suggested a perfect stability
over time in a neutral pH and salt-free aqueous environment, that
is distilled water.10

For generating
higher quantities of capsules as needed in this study, this procedure
has been revisited and optimized by systematically varying the values
of pH, lignin concentration, water/oil phases ratio, ultrasonication
power, and time. As a result, a 1:1 mixture of an aqueous SKL solution
(0.5% w/v) at pH ∼12 and the oily phase, firstly magnetically
stirred for 5 min and subsequently treated by ultrasonication at 160
W (40% amplitude) for 10 min, was found to be the most efficient setup
for the generation of lignin microcapsules. This approach results
in a 5-fold increase of volume of isolated and “concentrated”,
that is, densely packed SKL microcapsules. Most noteworthy is that
using these further optimized conditions, it was also possible for
the first time to process and isolate microcapsules from SLS upon
ultrasonication starting from oil-in-water emulsions.

Assessment
of Robustness of LMCs: Time-Dependent Stability
Freshly made
and 6 month-old SLS-MCs and SKL-MCs generated using
the optimized setup display statistical quantitative characteristics
that are de facto identical in the range of the average error determined
for the chosen statistical quantitative analysis, as reported in Table 1. Consequently, the
stability index, best defined as the ratio between the number of LMCs
at day 1 and the number of the re-analyzed LMCs at day 180, is practically
equal to 1 in both cases. These results indicate that SLS-MCs and
SKL-MCs generated using the optimized protocol display stability profiles
over time, comparable to those reported in the previous studies by
our research group.10 These data suggest
that the fundamental intermolecular interactions leading to the formation
of the lignin microcapsules remain eventually unaffected by the change
of conditions used for generating LMCs, thus pointing to a noteworthy
robustness of the underlying principles of LMC formation.

Overall, these data confirm the long shelf life of
SLS-MCs and
SKL-MCs in aqueous, salt-free solutions at pH 7. Storage of LMCs in
deionized water is, however, unrealistic with respect to any application
scenario. Therefore, the stability in conditions similar to those
in intended uses of SLS-MCs, as well as SKL-MCs, especially as carrier
systems in industrial, pharmaceutical, and biomedical applications
was tested and compared.

Stimuli-Triggered Disassembly of SLS-MCs
Assessment
of Robustness of LMCs: Temperature- and Pressure-Dependent
Stability
The possible use of lignin microcapsules in biomedical
applications in the form of aqueous suspensions comprises systems
susceptible to classical sterilization by autoclaving, or freezing
for storage and preservation of LMCs hosting temperature-sensitive
actives.

SLS-MC robustness has been tested at standard sterilization
conditions, that is, under high temperature and high pressure, using
an autoclave set at 121 °C and 2026 mbar for 30 min. Interestingly,
autoclaved SLS-MCs display similar statistical quantitative analysis
data to their reference sample, evidenced by a stability index practically
equal to 1 (Table 2, entries 1 and 2). SLS-MCs are thus stable under standard autoclaving
settings as applied in industrial, pharmaceutical, and biomedical
applications.

and Pressure-Dependent Disassembly

Under classical freezing conditions, that
is, −20 °C
under atmospheric pressure, SLS-MCs undergo a drastic alteration of
the statistical quantitative key numbers when compared to their reference
sample. The stability index drops below 0.1, that is, >90% of the
SLS-MCs were disassembled (Table 2, entry 3). Given that SLS-MCs were suspended in distilled
water for these tests, the almost total disassembly of the SLS-MCs
upon freezing can be reasoned in the light of the effect of the ice
crystals formed in the aqueous environment and the internal microscopic
crystals of the oily phase within the SLS-MCs. While these data represent
a limitation in the case of temperature-sensitive encapsulants, these
results do point, on the other hand, to interesting potential in applications
in which the low temperature-triggered release is desired, for example,
in optical controls in packaging applications.

pH-Triggered
Disassembly of SLS-MCs
The pH-dependent
stability studies of SLS-MCs were carried out in a general screening
approach for identifying the conditions of disassembly of the stable
“concentrated” SLS-MCs as a function of the pH at the
site of interest, allowing eventually for the design of targeted release
protocols also via targeted chemical modifications of the lignins
before LMC formulation.

Electronic interactions have an important
role in the science of intermolecular interactions, particularly those
involving aromatic rings leading to interactions between the aromatic
moieties themselves and between both positively and negatively charged
groups and aromatic systems.39 In addition,
coulombic forces can make relevant contributions to stability or disassembly
of macromolecular and aggregated structures40,41 and thus, by analogy, to the stability or cleavage of the SLMC shell
structures.

Electrostatic forces are in general strong and have
a long range,
and they often dominate the properties of supermolecular assemblies.
Thus, a pH-triggered disassembly of SLS-MC shell structures can be
reasoned in the light of the electrostatic interactions of the system.

SLS contains two types of ionizable groups, that is, sulfonates
(pKa ∼2) and phenolic groups (pKa ∼10).24 Therefore,
from pH 1 to 2, the SLS moieties are mainly protonated leading to
a neutral net charge, which is expected to be distributed throughout
the SLS-MC shell. In this context, a possible explanation for the
cleavage of more than 90% of the SLS-MCs at these pH values (Table 3, entries 1 and 2
and Figure 2) is the
ion–dipole, that is, “cation−π”,42 interactions arising from the electrostatic
interactions between the cations, here, H+ and K+, and the lignin-inherent π systems of the aromatic groups.
These “cation−π” interactions will favor
an extended conformation in the extremes hence disassembly rather
than a compact structure of the SLS-MC shell.

On the other hand,
in the pH range of 3 to 6, the synergistic effect
of the “cation−π” interactions, here, mainly
between the sodium and the π systems of the aromatic groups,
and the intramolecular electrostatic repulsion resulting from the
deprotonation of the sulfonate groups in SLS will favor once more
an extended conformation, or disassembly, rather than a compact structure
of the SLS-MC shell. Overall, the essentially complete disassembly
of SLS-MCs, that is, more than 90% in the pH range of 1 to 6, demonstrates
the strong detrimental effect of the electrostatic interactions on
SLS-MC stability (Figure 2 and Table 3, entries 1 to 6) and underlines the importance of functional electronic
interactions between the aromatic moieties for LMC stability.

Based on these observations, a similar behavior of the SLS-based
LMCs was expected at alkaline pH. Under stronger alkaline conditions,
in addition to the sulfonate groups (pKa ∼2), the phenolic OH (pKa ∼10)
are also expected to be dissociated, displaying a negative net charge,
which is expected to be distributed throughout the SLS-MC shell. Consequently,
the intramolecular electrostatic repulsions in combination with the
previously reasoned destabilizing “metal cation−π”
interactions should favor LMC disassembly. With respect to the strong
detrimental effect observed in the acidic environments, however, an
increasing stability profile alongside the pH is observed under alkaline
conditions (Table 3, entries 8 to 14 and Figure 2A). This increased stability profile of SLS-MCs can be reasoned
in light of the increasing concentration of the hydroxide OH–, which results in increasing ionic interactions overcoming the disassembling
cation−π interactions, that is, between Na+ and the π systems of the aromatic groups.

The differences
in the detrimental effects of acidic or alkaline
buffer systems on the stability of SLS-MCs may, however, be also reasoned
on the basis of a probable stabilizing or destabilizing effect of
the ions themselves that characterize the used buffer systems, here,
chloride, phosphate, and carbonate anions. A relative increasing proportion
of phosphate and/or carbonate anions with respect to the overall ionic
contents is observed alongside the seemingly stability-enhancing increase
of pH (Table 3, entries
8 to 14). Additional hints at a strong influence of salts in general
and specific ion species in particular are visible from the stability
tests at pH 7: at neutral pH, a 5-fold increase in molarity of the
same buffer system from 0.02 to 0.1 m, corresponding to an
increase in salinity from 2.6 to 12.9 ppt, leads to a doubling of
the loss of SLS-MCs with respect to the reference sample in deionized
water (Table 3, entries
7 to 9). Therefore, the strong disassembly of SLS-MCs observed at
pH 7 in the buffer system at 0.1 m can be reasoned in the
light of the detrimental effect of the salinity (Figure 2).

In addition to the
decreasing number of SLS-MCs observed in the
pH-dependent stability screening, it is generally observed that the
remaining SLS-MCs display drastically altered statistical quantitative
characteristics with respect to the reference sample. At pH 9, >70%
of the SLS-MCs were lost, and the remaining SLS-MCs displayed a practically
doubled mean size as well as an increased PDI with respect to the
values of these statistical quantitative characteristics in the reference
sample (Table 3, entries
7 and 11). Based on these results, the mechanism of SLS-MC disassembly
can be reasoned by the following three hypotheses.

Given that
in the different pH conditions, the relative net charge
is expected to be distributed throughout the shell, in a first approach,
the mechanism of SLS-MC disassembly can be explained through a swelling/bursting
process, meaning that the different layers of the shell disintegrate
by detaching from each other due to the electrostatic repulsions in
a centrifugal progressive movement. A second hypothesis is the ripening
process, meaning that two or more small SLS-MCs merge together to
form one big SLS-MC. An alternative hypothesis is that the swelling/bursting
and the ripening processes occur simultaneously (Figure 3).

Figure 3 (A) Effect on SLS-MCs
at pH 9; (B) swelling/bursting hypothesis;
and (C) ripening hypothesis.

UV–vis analyses on representative samples in which
the remaining
LMCs display drastically altered statistical quantitative characteristics
allowed for clarifying the nature of capsule alteration (Table 4). As reported in Table 4, columns 2 and 3,
in the presence of salts, more than 50% of the SLS-MCs disassembled,
and the masses of SLS increased considerably with respect to the reference
(changed by 180 and 91 μg vs 9 μg in the reference), suggesting
a swelling/bursting process. On the contrary, when surfactants are
present (Table 4, columns
4 and 5), ∼50% of the SLS-MCs are disassembled, and the masses
of SLS are comparable to the reference (changed by 5 and 11 μg
vs 9 μg in the reference), indicating the occurrence of a ripening
process. Overall, independent of the pH effect, in surfactant solutions
(3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) and
4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethane sulfonic acid (HEPES)), LMCs
undergo ripening, whereas in nonsurfactant salt solutions they just
swell and burst.

Assessment of Salinity-Dependent
Disassembly of SLS-MCs
Electronic interactions between aromatic
moieties in organic molecules
are strongly dependent, in terms of their effectiveness, on the surrounding
conditions set by the solvent and other potential ingredients and
additives, like salts or surfactants. With respect to a discussion
of LMC stability, these facts are especially important and worth studying
given that: (i) early studies on lignin reactivity already indicated
that hydrogen bond formation and other secondary valences strongly
affect the solubility and colloidal behavior as well as reactivity
and general rheological behavior of lignins16,19,23,43 and (ii) the
generation of the LMC shell structure represents a case in which the
intrinsic stacking propensities of lignin and its hydrophobic interactions
play a key role.10

Consequently,
kosmotropic and chaotropic agents, classifiable according to the Hofmeister
theories40,44−48 and ordered in the Hofmeister series,44,49 are expected to affect the LMC shell stability. Chaotropic species
should destabilize interactions, whereas kosmotropic agents are expected
to have stabilizing effects; mechanistically, this means that ion–dipole
interactions between ions of the salts and lignin-inherent dipoles
within the aromatic moieties are more determining of the fate of the
LMCs than interactions between protons and these lignin-inherent dipoles.50 Usually, the salt concentration at which specificity
shows up is moderately high, for example, above 10–100 mm.47,51

With respect to their potential industrial,
pharmaceutical, and
biomedical applications, a connection between the Hofmeister series
and the stability of polyphenol-based nanostructures is established
for the first time; that is, the effects of physiologically meaningful
ions on LMC stability have been explicitly assessed. Particular attention
has been paid to the following kosmotropic anionic and cationic series:
PO43– < CO32– < SO42– < CH3COO– < HPO42– < Cl– < H2PO4– < HCO3–, and Mg2+ <
Ca2+ < H+ < Na+ < K+, respectively. Obviously, the chaotropic character follows
the opposite direction. The results are summarized in Table 6 and need to be seen in connection
with the results presented in Table 4 as discussed in the following paragraphs.

Similar
statistical quantitative characteristics of SLS-MCs were
observed in both deionized H2O and aqueous Na2HPO4 solutions at pH 7 and a salinity of 10 ppt (Table 5, entry 14). In contrast,
2 and 33% of the SLS-MCs were disassembled in aqueous PBS and NaCl
solutions at pH 7 and a salinity of ∼10 and 5 ppt, respectively
(Table 5, entries 3
and 10). These results underline the applicability of the Hofmeister
series for predictions regarding the SLS-MC stability: Phosphate ions
as strong kosmotropic agents have a stabilizing effect on SLS-MCs.
Chloride anions known as borderline kosmotropic/chaotropic agent,
on the other hand, are expected to be more detrimental rather than
beneficial. In the case of PBS, the phosphate anion as a strong kosmotropic
agent compensates for the deleterious effects of additionally present
relatively chaotropic species, here, chloride. This compensatory effect
is confirmed by the increasing stability profile of SLS-MCs alongside
the increasing proportion of phosphate and/or carbonate in alkaline
environments (Table 5, entries 10 to 14).

At neutral pH, 30, 55, and 60% of
the SLS-MCs were disassembled
after 48 h in aqueous NaCl solutions at 5, 9, and 15 ppt, respectively
(Table 5, entries 3,
7, and 18). These results underline the deleterious effect of a high
chaotropic content, here, presented by both sodium and chloride ions.

The phenomenon of decreased stability at increasing salinity, observed
for aqueous NaCl solutions (Table 5, entries, 3, 7, and 18) is generally also seen in
buffer systems containing both chaotropic and kosmotropic agents.
One example is the phosphate buffer system containing 84% chaotropic
agents, sodium, and dihydrogen phosphate ions and only 16% moderately
kosmotropic agent, that is, hydrogen phosphate. As reported in Table 6, entries 2 and 17, 40 and 90% of the SLS-MCs were disassembled
in the same type of buffer system by simply augmenting the buffering
capacity from 0.02 to 0.1 m, corresponding to an increase
in salinity from 2.6 to 12.9 ppt.

More than 90% of the SLS-MCs were
disassembled at neutral pH in
0.09 m solutions of CaCl2 and MgSO4 at 10 ppt salinity (Table 5, entries 12 and 13). This is most probably due to the complexation
capacity of the dications, that is, Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations, which induced the disassembly of the SLS-MC shell.

As indicated above, LMC-stability is pH-dependent. Using buffer
salts for controlling the pH does, however, also introduce chaotropic
and kosmotropic elements into the LMC solution: at different pH values,
that is, pH 1 and 7 (Table 5, entries 4 and 11), >90 and ∼70 of the SLS-MCs
were
disassembled in aqueous KCl solutions at salinities of 4.8 and 10
ppt, respectively. These results indicate that in acidic environments,
the chaotropic potential is more effective even at relatively low
salinity. The reinforcement of the chaotropic potential by the acidic
environment is also seen in buffer systems with the same proportion
of both chaotropic and kosmotropic agents.

Overall, except in
the case of the kosmotropic dicationic agents,
the analytical data summarized in Table 5 are by and large in line with expected cumulative
disassociating effects of chaotropic agents and the compensatory effect
of the kosmotropic agents, each amplified or tempered by additional
pH-related factors.49,52,53

Effect of Physiologically Relevant Organic Molecules on the
Stability of SLS-MCs
The effects of physiologically relevant
organic molecules, that is, proteins and sugars, on the stability
of SLS-MCs have been also tested in light of their potential use as
carrier systems in pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Two
bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions (6% w/v) in phosphate (pH 8)
and acetate buffer (pH 6) were labelled PBM-1 (physiological background
mixture) and PBM-2, respectively.

Portions of the SLS-MCs (25
and ∼40%) were disassembled in PBM-1 (pH 8) and PBM-2 (pH 6),
respectively (Table 6, entries 3 and 4). This can be rationalized on the basis of the
disassembling effect of the acidic environment in the case of PBM-2
and on the basis of the kosmotropic effect of the phosphate anions
in the case of PBM-1.

A 6% w/v BSA solution in distilled H2O was tested for
the “protein effect” alone; the concentration corresponds
to the physiological concentration of the overall protein content
in blood. In such a solution, no significant capsule disassembly occurred,
demonstrating that pure albumin does not significantly affect SLS-MC
stability (Table 6,
entries 1 and 2).

In a 5% w/v aqueous glucose solution, corresponding
to the standard
glucose concentration for eventual intravenous administrations, ∼20%
of the SLS-MCs were disassembled (Table 6, entry 5); this demonstrates that glucose
has slightly detrimental effects on SLS-MC shell stability.

Effect
of Surfactants on the Stability of SLS-MCs
As
intuitively expectable, the effect of surfactants on the SLS-MC stability
also has to be assessed in connection with salinity- and pH-effects
in light of potential applications of LMCs, here, especially in home
and personal care products. By definition, surfactants are compounds
that lower the surface or interfacial tension between two liquids,
between a gas and a liquid, or between a liquid and a solid.54,55 The assessment of such effects of surfactants on SLS-MC stability
was realized in 5% v/v aqueous solutions of different types of industrially
used surfactants, represented by an alcohol ethoxylate (AE-25) as
a nonionic surfactant, an amine oxide (AO) as an amphoteric surfactant,
and a high linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (HLSA) as a synthetic anionic
surfactant. Sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) and 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) were used as buffer systems
commonly used in biological contexts.

In aqueous solution of
AE-25 at neutral pH, ∼60% of the SLS-MCs were disassembled
(Table 7, entries 6
to 8). These results indicate that surfactants significantly affect
SLS-MC stability, whose effect may be eventually amplified by pH and
salinity.

Aqueous amphoteric surfactants have been tested by
using AO at
pH 8 and a salinity of 54 ppt. As results have shown, ∼70%
of the SLS-MCs were disassembled (Table 7, entries 10 to 12), underlining the high-salinity
driven relative amplification of the detrimental effect of surfactants
on SLS-MCs. In addition, the electrostatic repulsions between the
sulfonates present in the SLS-MC shell and the AO zwitterions contribute
also to the disassembling effect.

HLAS has been used as an exemplary
alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant.
Aqueous HLAS solution at pH 2 and a salinity of 45 ppt causes ∼90%
of the SLS-MCs to disassemble (Table 7, entries 2 to 4).

In aqueous surfactant solutions
of SDS (29 ppt) and MOPS (21 ppt),
40 and 30% of the SLS-MCs were disassembled, respectively (Table 7, entries 5 and 9).
In comparison to a nonsurfactant aqueous solution at relatively low
salinity, that is, NaCl (15 ppt), in which 60% of the SLS-MCs were
disassembled (Table 5, entry 18), MOPS and SDS have thus only moderate destructive effects
on SLS-MCs even at relatively high salinities.

Assessment
of the Stability of SLS-MCs in Organic Solvents
The stability
profile of SLS-MCs in organic solvents has been assessed
in light of potential applications in organic synthesis, for example
as a catalyst housing. Aqueous SLS-MC suspensions were dialyzed against
apolar aliphatic, nonpolar aromatic, and polar protic organic solvents
for 24 h. This screening aimed to evaluate the effect of osmotic stress
on the SLS-MC stability.

As reported in Table 8, ∼60 and 50% of the SLS-MCs were
disassembled in toluene and hexane, respectively. A possible explanation
for the cleavage of SLS-MCs is the lysis of the SLS-MC shells due
to osmotic effects. This is corroborated by the presence of elements
of the oily phase in the organic solvents (Table 8, entries 2 and 3). The representative fatty
acid components of olive oil revealed by the GC–MS analysis
demonstrate the cleavage of the LMC shell structures.

Hofmeister effects occur universally in aqueous electrolyte
systems;
however, some studies demonstrate the occurrence of specific ion effects
on the activity of enzymes also in non-aqueous media.56 In addition, the existence of chaotropic organic solvents,
like ethanol, has been demonstrated.57 The
complete disassembly of SLS-MCs in organic solvents can thus be attributed
to the synergistic action of the no osmosis/poor osmosis and chaotropic
potential of ethanol (Table 8, entry 4).

 

Stimuli-Triggered
Disassembly of SKL-MCs
At present,
SKL is one of the most cost-effective available lignins in industrial
quantities.22 Therefore, development of
materials based on SKL should be beneficial for the future sustainable
society and add value to a renewable resource. In this respect, a
study of stimuli-triggered disassembly of SKL-MCs was carried out
in light of their potential use as carrier systems for industrial
applications as a potential alternative to SLS-MCs previously discussed.

Assessment
of Temperature- and Pressure-Dependent Stability
of SKL-MCs
Autoclaved SKL-MCs, like autoclaved SLS-MCs, display
similar statistical quantitative analytical data in comparison to
their reference samples (Table 2, entries 1 and 2), demonstrating their suitability for applications
in which sterilization processes might be required.

Similar
to frozen SLS-MCs, the statistical quantitative characteristics of
the frozen SKL-MCs are altered significantly when compared to the
reference sample. Approximately 90% of SKL-MCs disassembled after
freezing and the remaining SKL-MCs display practically the double
of the mean size with a high PDI with respect to the reference sample
(Table 2, entry 3).

Assessment of pH-Dependent Disassembly of SKL-MCs
In
acidic environments, that is, a pH range of 1 to
6, more than 90% of the SKL-MCs were disassembled (Table 3, entries 1 to 6). This complete
cleavage of the SKL-MCs is essentially due to the “cation−π”
interactions, as discussed in the case of SLS-MCs.

However,
at alkaline pH, that is, a pH range from 8 to 12,
SKL-MCs and SLS-MCs display different stability profiles. In the alkaline
buffer systems, ∼60% of the SKL-MCs were disassembled regardless
of the molarity or the salinity, whereas SLS-MCs display an increasing
stability profile alongside the pH (Table 3, entries 10 to 14). This can be rationalized
on the basis of their different structure and the pKa difference, that is, pKa ranges from 1.8 to 6.958 and from ∼6
to ∼1116,23,59 for SLS and SKL, respectively.

In the considered alkaline
pH range of 8 to 10, the acid groups
are expected to be dissociated by and large, displaying a negative
net charge on the SKL-MC shell. Consequently, intermolecular electrostatic
repulsions should stabilize the SKL-MC. On the contrary, at low pH
values, the lower electrostatic repulsion would favor the ripening
processes. Furthermore, ionic interactions, that is, Na+ and RCOO– from the deprotonated SKL as well as
Na+ and OH–, are more favored than the
disassembling cation–π interactions,
that is, Na+ and π systems of the
aromatic groups present in SKL. In addition, the only moderate detrimental
effect of the alkaline buffer systems on SKL-MCs may be also due to
a stabilizing effect of phosphate and carbonate anions.

Assessment
of Salinity-Dependent Disassembly of SKL-MCs
As summarized
in Table 4, in the
range of the established average error, the results of the
salinity-dependent disassembly of SKL-MCs are comparable to the general
trend of the salinity-dependent disassembly of SLS-MCs.

Effect of
Organic Molecules on the Stability of SKL-MCs
Comparable
statistical quantitative analytical data were observed
in both SKL-MC and SLS-MC stability screening in organic molecules,
that is, perfectly stable in BSA and glucose and moderately stable
in PBM-1 and PBM-2. Data are given in Table 6.

Effect of Surfactants on the Stability of
SKL-MCs
The
effect of surfactants on the stability of SKL-MCs has been determined
in the same manner as already discussed above for the case of SLS-MCs.
As reported in Table 7, aqueous nonionic surfactants, such as AE-25, have a moderate detrimental
effect in both SLS-MCs and SKL-MCs, that is, ∼50% of the SKL-MCs
and ∼60% of the SLS-MCs were disassembled.

However, SKL-MCs
display a different stability profile in aqueous AO at pH 8 and 54
ppt salinity: under these conditions, they are not significantly affected,
whereas under the same conditions, ∼70% of the SLS-MCs were
disassembled (Table 7, entries 10 to 12). This difference is due to the electrostatic
repulsions between the sulfonates and the AO zwitterions resulting
in the strong disassembling effect on the SLS-MC shell.

In aqueous
HLAS solution at pH 2 and a salinity of 45 ppt, ∼90%
of both the SKL-MCs and SLS-MCs were disassembled (Table 7, entries 2 to 4), demonstrating
that the deleterious effect of the strongly acidic pH and high salinity
on SLS-MC stability is stronger than any potential stabilizing effect
of the considered surfactant.

Assessment of the Disassembly
of SKL-MCs in Organic Solvents
As summarized in Table 8, the analytical data
of the disassembly of SKL-MCs and SLS-MCs
in organic solvents have similar general trends.

Conclusions
Technical lignins have shown to be excellent matrices for the ultrasound-mediated
synthesis of microcapsules for active delivery. Irrespective of the
industrial origin, microcapsules can be efficiently synthesized with
different stimuli-responsive behaviors. Lignosulfonate microcapsules
have been synthesized, and their stability and stimuli-responsive
behavior have been studied in comparison with the responsiveness of
kraft lignin microcapsules. Strategies for increasing efficiency in
the generation of ultrasound-assisted LMCs have been achieved using
both softwood lignosulfonate (SLS) and softwood kraft lignin (SKL).

LMCs show excellent stability over time under high temperature
and pressure (autoclaving conditions). They also display excellent
to very good stability in solutions of physiologically relevant organic
molecules, that is, proteins and sugars, which is of crucial relevance
in the case of pharmaceutical applications. Stimuli-triggered disassembly
can be induced by tuning the pH conditions: they are stable in alkaline
conditions (pH 7 to 12) and disassemble under acidic conditions (pH
1 to 6). Lignosulfonate microcapsules show higher stability than the
kraft lignin ones at alkaline pH values. The salinity of the medium
is a further tool to trigger capsule disassembly and active release.
Surfactants also affect significantly LMC stability, whose effect
may be eventually amplified by pH and salinity. Figure 4 graphically summarizes the findings of this
work.

Figure 4 Overview demonstrating LMC stabilities under various conditions.

The generation of the LMC shell
structure represents a case in
which the intrinsic stacking propensities of lignin and its hydrophobic
interactions play a key role.10 Consequently,
when approaching the salinity effect on the stability of LMCs, the
chaotropic or kosmotropic nature of the salts employed has to be taken
into consideration. Therefore, this paper establishes a connection
between the Hofmeister series and stability of polyphenol-based nanostructures.
Overall, except in the case of the kosmotropic dicationic agents,
the analytical data are by and large in line with the expected cumulative
disassociating effect of chaotropic agents and the associating effect
of the kosmotropic agents.

The results as a whole indicate differences
between SLS-LMCs and
SKL-LMCs. These differences are expected from their chemical differences.
Chemical characteristics, however, can be efficiently altered by chemically
transforming specific functional groups in lignins. Such alterations
can be used for altering LMC characteristics, as has been shown by
our group in very early studies. The beauty of the simple LMCs generated
only on the basis of intermolecular interactions, however, lies in
the fact that the lignin is used as it is, omitting additional costs
and the environmental burden connected to upstream or concomitant
chemical lignin modification. The present study forms the basis for
constructing LMCs with specific stability profiles by choosing the
most suitable lignin or mixture of lignins.

without further purification if not stated otherwise. Softwood lignosulfonate
(SLS) was obtained from Borregard; softwood kraft lignin (SKL) was
obtained from the French Institute of Technology “Forêt
Cellulose Bois-construction Ameublement” (FCBA).

Preparation
of Aqueous SLS and SKL Solutions
An aqueous
SLS solution (0.5% w/v) was freshly prepared by dissolving 100 mg
of SLS in 20 mL of distilled H2O. The pH of the system
was adjusted to pH ∼12 by adding some drops of aqueous 1 n NaOH. An aqueous SKL solution (0.5% w/v) was prepared for
each use by suspending 100 mg of SKL in 20 mL of distilled H2O. The SKL solution was obtained by adding some drops of aqueous
1 n NaOH, raising the pH of the system to pH ∼12.

Preparation of Starting Emulsion and LMC Generation
The
aqueous SLS or SKL solutions (500 μL) were mixed with 500
μL of olive oil. This biphasic system was magnetically stirred
for 5 min. Using a Branson digital sonifier (Model 450L, Ultrasonic
Corporation) equipped with a 20 kHz Branson probe ending in a sonication
tip, the mixture was then ultrasonicated at room temperature (RT)
with a power of 160 W (40% amplitude) for 10 min.

Isolation of
the LMCs
The isolation of the LMCs from
the remaining liquid was realized by centrifugation of the emulsion
obtained after sonication at 5000 rpm for 15 min. The lower aqueous
phase was removed, and the foamy supernatant consisting of the LMCs
was washed as follows to remove residual lignin and oil. “Washing”
consisted of re-suspending the LMCs in 1000 μL of distilled
H2O before repeating the centrifugation and phase separation
step as previously described. This “washing” was performed
at least twice to obtain the “concentrated”, that is,
densely packed LMCs. The pH of these “concentrated”
LMCs was ∼7.

Preparation of Buffer Solutions
Buffers were prepared
using appropriate ratios of the salts establishing the buffer systems
listed in Table 9.

Preparation of Salt Solutions
Aqueous
phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) solution (0.1 m) was prepared by dissolving
0.800 g of NaCl, 0.020 g of KCl, 0.144 g of Na2HPO4, and 0.024 g of KH2PO4 in 80.0 mL of
distilled H2O.38 The pH was
adjusted to 7.4 by using 1 n aqueous NaOH before the solution
was brought to a final volume of 100 mL.

Aqueous (3-(n-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) solution (0.1 m)
was prepared by dissolving 0.523 g of MOPS in 25 mL of distilled H2O, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with 1 n aqueous
NaOH.

Aqueous (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethane sulfonic
acid (HEPES)
solution (0.1 m) was prepared by dissolving 0.596 g of HEPES
in 25 mL of distilled H2O, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4
with 1 n aqueous NaOH.

Aqueous sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) solution (0.1 M) was prepared
by dissolving 1.442 g of SDS in 50 mL of distilled H2O.
The pH of this solution was ∼7.

Aqueous NaCl solutions
at different concentrations were prepared
by dissolving 50, 90, and 150 mg of NaCl in 10 mL of distilled H2O; aqueous NaCl solutions of 0.08, 0.15, and 0.26 m with salinities of 5, 9, and 15 ppt,
respectively, were obtained. The pH of these solutions was ∼7.

Aqueous KCl, CaCl2, and MgSO4 solutions at
10 ppt salinity were prepared by dissolving 100 mg of each salt in
10 mL; aqueous KCl, CaCl2, and MgSO4 solutions
with concentrations of 0.13, 0.09, and 0.08 m, respectively,
were obtained. The pH of these solutions was ∼7.

Preparation
of Surfactant Solutions
Aqueous solutions
of selected industrial surfactants, that is, alcohol ethoxylate (AE-25),
high linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (HLSA), and amine oxide (AO), were
prepared at 5% v/v.

Preparation of Aqueous Solutions of Physiologically
Relevant
Organic Molecules
Aqueous protein solutions were prepared
at 6% w/v, that is, bovine serum albumin (BSA) in distilled H2O at pH ∼8 and mixture enzymes in phosphate and acetate
buffer systems at 6% w/v at pH 8 and 6, respectively. These mixture
enzymes were labelled PBM-1 (physiological background mixture) and
PBM-2. An aqueous glucose solution at pH 7 was prepared at 5% w/v.

Temperature- and Pressure-Triggered Release Screening
The
“concentrated” LMCs (10 μL) were dispersed
in 990 μL of distilled H2O in an Eppendorf tube suitable
for high temperatures. An aliquot was analyzed via optical microscopy
before and after the freezing and the heating processes. The freezing
was performed at room pressure (∼1000 mbar) for 1 week, and
the heating was performed in an autoclave at 121 °C at 2026 mbar
for 30 min.

Screening of LMC Disassembly in Various Aqueous
Media
The generated “concentrated” LMCs (10
μL) were
dispersed in an Eppendorf tube containing 990 μL of the medium
in which the stability of the LMCs was to be determined. LMCs were
dispersed homogeneously by gently shaking the system for 2 min. The
system was then observed for eventual macroscopic changes in its consistency
before it was kept at the various conditions for the indicated times
with occasional redispersing of eventually settled LMCs. The system
was gently shaken again, and an aliquot was taken and analyzed via
optical microscopy as discussed below.

Screening of LMC Disassembly
in Organic Solvents Via Dialysis
The “concentrated”
LMCs (10 μL) were dispersed
in an Eppendorf tube containing 990 μL of distilled H2O. The dispersion of the LMCs was performed by gently shaking the
system for 2 min. Thereafter, the system was transferred into a dialysis
bag, and the dialysis bag was placed in a beaker containing either
toluene, hexane, or ethanol and left stirring at RT for 24 h. Aliquots
of the aqueous phase were analyzed via optical microscopy before and
after the dialysis. In addition, aliquots of the toluene, hexane,
or ethanol phases were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) after concentration.

Gas Chromatography
Coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS)
Sample Preparation
Ethyl acetate (∼600 μL)
was used to dissolve the concentrated organic solvents, that is, toluene,
hexane, and ethanol phases from the dialysis process. In situ silylation
of the sample is performed by means of addition of 50 μL of
pyridine, followed by addition of 50 μL of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide 15 min
before analysis.

Measurement
Analysis was carried
out on 5 μL
aliquots using a Shimadzu GC–MS QP2010 Ultra equipped with
an AOi20 autosampler unit. An SLB-5ms capillary GC column (L × I.D. 30 m × 0.32 mm; df, 0.50 μm) was
used as the stationary phase, and He was used as the mobile phase
at 100 kPa pressure, 240 °C injection temperature, and 200 °C
interface temperature. Program: 50 °C start temperature for 1
min, 10 °C/min heating rate, and 240 °C final temperature
for 15 min. Mass analysis was performed after electron ionization
using ∼70 eV. Analysis was performed by using Shimadzu GC–MS
Solution software (version 2.61).

UV–Vis Analysis
Sample
Preparation
The generated “concentrated”
LMCs (10 μL) was dispersed in an Eppendorf tube containing 990
μL of the medium in which the stability of the LMCs was to be
determined. LMCs were dispersed homogeneously by gently shaking the
system for 2 min. After the microscopy analysis, the system was filtered
out, and the filtrate was used for UV–vis analysis.

Optical Microscopy Analysis and Statistical Analysis
Sample Preparation
The generated “concentrated”
LMCs (10 μL) was added into 990 μL of distilled H2O to form a suspension of LMCs. This suspension (5 μL)
was transferred onto a microscope carrier glass slide and covered
with a coverslip before microscopy analysis. In case the capsules
overlap to a large extent, the sample should be further diluted before
analysis.

Analysis
A Zeiss Axio Scope A1 microscope
was used
for the image analysis. All images were obtained with 100× objective
lens magnification. For optimizing the use of the 100× lens,
a drop of mineral oil was placed on the coverslip before the analysis
to function as an optical bridge.

Processing
The
pictures from the microscope were processed
by using the image analysis software ImageJ in combination with Microsoft
Office Excel-based analyses for generating statistical data for the
LMC samples. These statistical data are basically the LMC mean diameter,
the number of LMCs, the polydispersity index (PDI) of the LMC diameter
calculated according to the formula σ/μ (where σ
is the standard deviation and μ the mean diameter of the LMCs
in the sample under analysis), and the stability index, which is the
ratio between the number of LMCs after each experimental conditions
and the standard conditions.

The different screenings were performed
on the basis of statistical key figures (10 μL “concentrated”
LMCs at pH ∼7 in 990 μL distilled H2O before
analysis, RT, and 1 atm unless stated otherwise). Three images were
chosen for the software-based ImageJ analysis. Error analysis was
performed according to this protocol using 10 different samples. A
comparison between manual counting and ImageJ software-based counting
has been accomplished, screening different settings in the software.
Based on these various evaluations of the quality of the computer-based
analysis, an average error of the diameter and the number of MCs per
milliliter, 0.06 μm and 0.15 × 1012 LMCs/mL,
respectively, were established.
