The crystallization behavior of a
series of synthesized polylactide
(PLA)/poly(δ-valerolactone) (PVL) supramolecular copolymers
with 2-ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidinone (UPy) groups is
investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction.
The stereocomplexation of PLA-based supramolecular polymers (SMPs)
is strongly related to the block length, L/D ratios, and the UPy groups.
Both the increase of the PLA block length and the self-complementary
hydrogen bonding of the UPy end groups restrain the crystallization
of the PVL blocks. The stereocomplexation of PLA-SMPs is greatly promoted
by UPy groups, while the homocrystallization of PLA is constrained.
The dynamic mechanical analysis indicated that the enhanced stereocomplexation
would lead to higher thermal resistance and mechanical properties
of PLA-based SMPs.

Introduction
Supramolecular polymers
(SMPs), assembled by weak intermolecular
interaction such as metal coordination, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic
interaction, van der Waals force, and hydrophobic forces, are new
materials with a variety of reversible features.1−5 SMPs integrate not only the excellent properties
of polymers but also have the reversibility of the bond and the responsiveness
to the external environment. Because the bond energy and the bond
life of the noncovalent bond can be controlled by changing the temperature
or other environmental conditions, the noncovalent bond possesses
dynamic reversible characteristics. So far, the SMPs based on multiple
hydrogen bonds have received extensive attention because the multioverlap
and synergy among the multiple hydrogen bonds can produce a strong
binding energy. 2-Ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidinone (UPy)
is a representative multiple hydrogen-bonded motif formed by the self-complementary
quadruple hydrogen bonds.6,7 The dimerization constant
of UPy can reach 6 × 107 mol/L, which is close to
the strength of covalent linkages. However, the introduction of UPy
groups disrupts the structural symmetry of the polymer chains, and
consequently the mobility and regular folding of the polymer segments.8,9 A lower crystallinity would decrease the thermal and mechanical
properties of SMPs, which limits the wider application.

Stereocomplexation
(SC) is a unique mechanism between the stereoisomeric
polymers driven by the intermolecular hydrogen bonding, resulting
in strong crystallization capability.10,11 Therefore,
stereocomplexation technology provides a new approach to improve the
crystallization capacity of the difficult-to-crystallize or amorphous
polymer with different enantiomers. Polylactide (PLA) has two stereoisomers
poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) and poly(d-lactide) (PDLA),
and the racemic helical pairs are generated prior to the nucleation
of homo-polymorph in PLLA/PDLA blends.12,13 However, the
PLA stereocomplexation is greatly limited by the molecular weight,
L/D ratio, with limited probability for the intermolecular interaction
between PLLA and PDLA. Our former work presented enhanced stereocomplexation
by introducing soft segments, UPy end groups, and nanoparticles into
the PLA molecules.14−16 Therefore, enhancing the intermolecular interactions
between complementary enantiomers would facilitate the nucleation
and growth of SC crystallites. Pan and coauthors7,17 have
reported research work about UPy-functionalized PLA, showing that
the hydrogen-bonding interactions formed between the terminal UPy
groups of PLLA- and PDLA-enhanced sc crystallization ability and crystallization
rate. Furthermore, the dimerization of UPy groups shows good thermally
responsibility, and the dimerization is reported to dissociate at
about 80 °C.18,19 This thermal reversible behavior
provides the UPy-based SMPs shape-memory behavior and self-healing
performance, which are research interests in polymer functionalization.20 Li et al. also found that the formed network
by stereocomplex crystal as the physical cross-linking points obviously
improved the shape-memory properties of the resulting materials.21 Therefore, the preparation of PLA-based SMPs
with UPy groups could be the strategy to promote stereocomplexation.

Herein, a series of PLA-based triblock copolymer consisting of
poly(δ-valerolactone) (PVL) segment in the middle were synthesized
by sequential ring-opening polymerization. The UPy-functionalized
PLA–PVL–PLA SMPs were then synthesized by the coupling
reaction of PLA–PVL–PLA with UPy-NCO. This work focuses
on the stereocomplexation of those SMPs, compared with the stereocomplexation
behavior of stereoisomers without UPy end functionalization. The influence
of the length of PLA blocks and the L/D mixing ratios of stereoisomers
on the crystallization behaviors and thermal dynamical properties
was investigated.

Results and Discussion
PLA–PVL–PLA
triblock copolymers and UPy end-functionalized
PLA–PVL–PLA with different stereostructures of PLA blocks
were synthesized as shown in Scheme 1a. Table S1 lists the compositions
and molecular weights of PLA–PVL–PLA triblock copolymers.
In Figure S1, the 1H NMR spectra
of L-SMPs show peaks at 13.1, 11.9, and 10.2 ppm assigned to UPy groups.22,23 In Figure S2, PLA-based SMPs possess
excellent elasticity as transparent film compared to the related triblock
copolymers as white brittle films. Different physical states can be
explained by the mechanical flexibility induced by the UPy groups
with the self-complementary hydrogen bond as shown in Scheme 1c. The supramolecular multiblock
copolymer with alternating PVL and PLA blocks as stereo-multiblock
SMPs was then formed as shown in Scheme 1b. In Figure S3, the sc-SMPs with shorter PLA blocks are transparent and elastic
solids under all mixing ratios. However, the sc-SMPs with longer PLA
blocks are transparent and elastic solids with low D-SMPs content
(≤20 wt %), while those with smaller PLA blocks are opaque
and brittle solids with high D-SMPs content (>20 wt %). Therefore,
the length of the PLA blocks and the content of the D-SMPs are both
key factors affecting the physical states of the sc-SMPs and, consequently,
the crystallization and mechanical properties.

The influence of PLA block length and L/D ratios on the
crystallization
behavior of sc-SMPs was investigated. For comparison, differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of the triblock polymeric blends
without UPy functionalization are also shown in Supporting Information. The heating–cooling–reheating
curves of solvent-casting sc-SMPs are shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1a, the DSC curve of L-SMPs1.8 displays two endothermic
processes at 24–60 and 100 °C, assigned to the melting
of the PVL block and the PLLA block, respectively. With increasing
D-SMPs, the endothermic peak of PVL decreases. In Figure 1b (L-SMPs6.7), the melting
peak of PVL block disappears and the melting peak of hc-PLA at 150
°C decreases, while that of sc-PLA at 210 °C increases with
the increase of the D-SMPs ratio. The increase of the PLA length and
the enhanced stereocomplexation would constrain the crystallization
of the PVL blocks. More interesting, complete stereocomplexation could
be achieved when D-SMPs7.2 is more than 30%, which is attributed to
the flexibility of the introduced PVL blocks.15 For comparison, all L-VL-L1.6/D-VL-D1.8 blends show a melting process
of the PVL blocks at 30–60 °C in Figure S4a. For L-VL-L6.7/D-VL-D7.2 blends in Figure S4b, two melting peaks at 160 and 210 °C are assigned
to the melting of the hc-crystal and sc-crystal, respectively. When
the D content is higher than 40 wt %, complete stereocomplexation
is achieved. The comparison demonstrates that UPy-functionalization
enhances the intermolecular interactions between complementary enantiomers,
which facilitate the formation of sc-crystallites.7

Figure 1 DSC heating–cooling–reheating curves of L-SMPs/D-SMPs
blends: (a, c, e) for L-SMPs1.8/D-SMPs1.6 and (b, d, f) for L-SMPs6.7/D-SMPs7.2.

Figure 1c,e shows
the DSC cooling and subsequent heating curves of L-SMPs1.8/D-SMPs1.6.
For comparison, the L-VL-L1.6/D-VL-D1.8 blends are investigated in Figure S4c,e. The main differences were the crystallization
peak at 110 °C during cooling and then the melting peaks of PVL
at 40 °C in the second heating process, which were not obvious
in the SMPs but clear in the blends without UPy systems. On the contrary,
the melting peaks of sc-PLAs at 160 °C in the SMPS was much obvious
and also increase with the increasing D content. The hydrogen bond
between the UPy end groups behaved as cross-linking point and then
constrained the PVL crystallization, while the formed PLA sc-crystals
in the L-VL-L/D-VL-D blends acted as heterogeneous nucleating agents
for PVL crystallization.

Figure 1d,f displays
the DSC cooling and reheating curves of L6.7/D-7.2-SMPs. The two melting
peaks at 130 and 190 °C (Figure 1f) are attributed to the melting of the hc-crystal
and sc-crystal, respectively. When the D-SMPs content exceeds 30 wt
%, only the characteristic peaks of sc-crystal are present. For L-VL-L6.7
triblock copolymer in Figure S4d, a crystallization
peak is observed at 80 °C upon cooling, assigned to the crystallization
of the PLLA blocks. When with D-VL-D7.2 triblock copolymer, its crystallization
rate increases due to stereocomplexation between PLLA and PDLA blocks.
This indicates that the crystallization capacity of L-VL-L/D-VL-D
blends is increased upon stereocomplexation. However, the stereocomplexation
plays different roles in the triblock copolymeric blends with or without
UPy-functionalized groups.

Based on the above DSC, the melting
enthalpies of either PVL or
sc-PLA in different blends could be calculated from the area of the
related melting peaks as shown in Figure 2 versus the D-SMPs contents. When the PLA
length is short, the PVL melting enthalpies first increases and then
decrease with more D-SMPs introduced in the blends. A small amount
of physical intermolecular bondings could act as nucleating agents
for PVL, and the enhanced crystallinity results in the increase of
melting enthalpies. While more PLA block are involved in sterecomplexation,
the PVL molecular mobility is greatly constrained, which leads to
the decrease of the PVL melting enthalpies. In Figure 2b, as the D-SMPs contents increases, the
melting enthalpies of sc-PLA gradually increase. This indicated that
the stereocomplexation was greatly improved when the L/D ratio is
close to 1.

of the content of D-VL-D and D-SMPs in the L-VL-L/D-VL-D blends and
sc-SMPs.

Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD)
patterns of sc-SMPs and L-VL-L/D-VL-D
blends are discussed for the effect of UPy groups on the crystalline
structure. In Figure 3a, the neat L1.8-SMPs show obvious patterns at 16.8, 21.8, and 24.5°,
attributed to the (110)/(200) plane of the α crystal of PLLA
and diffraction from the (110) and (200) lattice planes of the orthorhombic
unit cell structure formed from PVL blocks, respectively.24 A novel diffraction peak arises at 12.0°
when the L1.8-SMPs blend with complementary D1.6-SMPs. The peak at
12.0° is assigned to the (110) plane of the PLLA β crystal
owing to the PLA stereocomplexation.25 With
the increasing D-SMPs amount, the peaks at 21.8 and 24.5° decrease
but that at 12.0° increases. In other words, the crystallinity
of the PVL blocks decreases, while the stereocomplex crystallization
increases in the L1.8/D1.6-SMPs. In Figure 3b, for the neat L6.7-SMPs, obvious diffraction
peaks at 16.8, 19.1, and 22.3° are assigned to the (110)/(200),
(203), and (210) planes of the PLLA α crystal, respectively.26 The diffraction peaks at 12.0 and 20.8°
are assigned to the 110 and 300/030 planes of the β crystal,
respectively.25 Moreover, these peaks increase
as the L-SMPs/D-SMPs mixing ratios approach 5/5.

Figure 3 WAXD patterns of solvent
cast (a) L-SMPs1.8/D-SMPs1.6 and (b) L-SMPs6.7/D-SMPs7.2.

To further elaborate the role of UPy end groups,
the WAXD patterns
of L-VL-L/D-VL-D blends are measured in Figure S5a. The L-VL-L1.6/D-VL-D1.8 blends show the diffraction peak
of β crystal, and the peak strength increases with increasing
D-VL-D amount. Figure S5b displays the
WAXD patterns of L-VL-L6.7/D-VL-D7.2 blends. The triblock copolymer
L-VL-L6.7 shows the WAXD pattern similar to that of L6.7-SMPs. However,
the characteristic patterns of both sc-PLA and hc-PLA are detected
for the L-VL-L6.7/D-DL-D7.2 blends. However, the related sc-SMPs blends
only present the stereocomplexes regardless of the content of D7.2-SMPs.
These results indicate that the self-complementary hydrogen-bonding
of UPy units facilitates the complete stereocomplexation of sc-SMPs.

The storage modulus and loss tangent (tan δ) of sc-SMPs
of L1.8/D1.6-SMPs are displayed in Figure 4. The storage modulus of sc-SMPs decreases
in the ranges from −50 to 0, 0 to 60, and >80 °C, attributed
to the glass transitions of PVL and PLA and softening PLA (or dissociation
of UPy dimers), respectively. The storage modulus of sc-SMPs at lower
range (<50 °C) first decreases and then increases with more
D content. This is because the strong hydrogen bonding of both stereocomplexation
and the UPy end groups limits the movement of the PVL chains. The
consequent crystallization capacity of the PVL blocks in sc-SMPs decreases.
However, a large number of stereocomplex crystals were formed with
further increasing of the mixing ratios (>30%), enhancing the storage
modulus. At higher temperature range (>50 °C, higher than Tm of PVL blocks), the storage modulus of sc-SMP
increases with increasing of the D-SMPs/L-SMPs mixing ratios. Therefore,
the stereocomplex crystallization of PLLA and PDLA blocks obviously
improves thermal resistance.

Figure 4 DMA curves of (a) storage modulus and (b) tan δ
versus
temperature for the L-SMPs1.8/D-SMPs1.6.

In Figure 4b, two
relaxation peaks at −50 to 50 °C and 50 to 80 °C
are assigned to the glass transitions of the PVL and PLA blocks, respectively.
The relaxation peak of PVL at lower temperature range first shifts
to the lower- and then higher-temperature regions with increasing
of D-SMPs content. Meanwhile, the area of PVL relaxation peak first
increases and then decreases with more D-SMPs content. This can be
explained by the first enhanced chain mobility of PVL and then increased
PVL crystallinity with more D-SMPs and also higher degree of sterecomplexation.
When the PVL block length is much longer than the PLA length, the
PVL molecule mobility was first increased and then decreased when
the D-SMPs contents increased. This result is similar with the trend
of PVL melting enthalpies against D-SMPs content. In addition, the
area of relaxation peak corresponding to the PLA block shows a decreasing
trend, attributed to the increased crystallinity and the decreased
amorphous content of PLA. This result can also be reflected by the
shift of the PLLA glass transition peak to high-temperature range
by enhanced stereocomplexation. The thermal dynamic mechanical study
indicated that the mechanical properties of sc-SMPs can be adjusted
by varying the L-SMPs/D-SMPs mixing ratios.

Conclusions
A
series of UPy end-functionalized PLA–PVL–PLA with
different stereostructure and molecular weight were synthesized. The
stereocomplexation of PLA-based SMPs was further prepared by the blending
UPy end-functionalized PLLA–PVL–PLLA and PDLA–PVL–PDLA.
The crystallization behavior of sc-SMPs is strongly influenced by
the block lengths and the L/D mixing ratios, with the comparison of
sc-triblock copolymers. The sc-SMPs presented enhanced stereocomplexation
even at unequal L/D ratio, which is attributed to the hydrogen bonding
of the UPy groups. This study presents the tailored crystallization
by introducing stereocomplexation as well as promoted stereocomplexation
by noncovalent UPy groups.

Experimental Section
Materials Details
l- and d-Lactide
(≥99.5%) (Changchun Shengboma Biological Co., LTD) were recrystallized
in dried toluene. Diethylene glycol (DEG, 99%) and δ-valerolactone
(VL, 99%) were purchased from J&K Chemical. Dihydroxyl-terminated
PVL macroinitiator was prepared as reported in the literature.27

2(6-Isocyanatohexylaminocarbonylamino)-6-methyl-4[1H]pyrimidinone (UPy-NCO) was produced by 1,6-hexyldiisocyanate
(HDI, J&K Chemical) and 2-amino-4-hydroxyl-6-methyl pyrimidine
(J&K Chemical) according to the previous literature.28

Stannous octoate (Sn(Oct)2)
and dibutyltin dilaurate
were purchased from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co. Dry toluene
was used as solvent.

Synthesis of PLA–PVL–PLA Copolymers
PLA–PVL–PLA
triblock oligomers were first synthesized using dihydroxyl-terminated
PVL macroinitiator to initiate the polymerization of lactide monomer
with Sn(Oct)2 as catalyst. The ring-opening polymerization
of lactide was carried out in a Schlenk flask under nitrogen at 130
°C overnight. The product was dissolved in dichloromethane and
precipitated in methanol three times. Then, the products were dried
in vacuum oven. The enantiomers of PLA–PVL–PLA triblock
copolymers were marked as L-VL-Lx or D-VL-Dx, where x represents the average number
molecular weight of the PLA end block based on the 1H NMR
spectra.

Synthesis of PLA–PVL–PLA Copolymers with UPy End
Groups
PLA–PVL–PLA copolymers were functionalized
with UPy as end groups by their reaction with excess of UPy-NCO. Excess
UPy-NCO was reacted with the synthesized PLA–PVL–PLA
in Schlenk flask in vacuum line. Dry toluene was chosen as a solvent
and Sn(Oct)s as a catalyst. The whole reaction was carried out under
nitrogen at 110 °C for 20 h. Excess UPy-NCO and solvent were
removed by filtration and reduced pressure distillation, respectively.
The products were first dissolved in chloroform and then with the
addition of silica and dibutyltin dilaurate under 60 °C for 2
h. Then, the final products were collected by the filtration of silica
and solvent evaporation.

Preparation of sc-SMPs
The UPy end-functionalized
PLLA–PVL–PLLA
and PDLA–PVL–PDLA blends (as L-SMPs and D-SMPs, respectively)
were mixed together in a solvent. The L/D ratios of the L-SMPs/D-SMPs
blends were chosen to be 9/1, 8/2, 7/3, 6/4, or 5/5. The blending
solution was cast in PTFE mold and dried in a vacuum oven. For comparison,
PLLA–PVL–PLLA/PDLA–PVL–PDLA blends with
different L/D ratios were also prepared by solution casting. In this
work, Lx/Dy-SMPs m/n and Lx/Dy m/n represent the L-SMPs/D-SMPs and PLLA–PVL–PLLA/PDLA–PVL–PDLA
blends, respectively, where x and y are the length of the PLLA and PDLA block, respectively, and m/n means the L/D ratio.

Measurement
1H NMR measurements were carried
out for the chemical structure characterization by a 400 MHz Bruker
AVANCE II nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin
Co., Switzerland) in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) as solvent
and tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. The molecular weight
of the synthesized product was determined by a Waters gel permeation
chromatography instrument with polystyrene as standard materials.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, METTLER) was chosen for the
measurement of the thermal properties and the crystallization behavior
of PLA copolymers and their blends. The measurement program was cooling–heating–recooling–reheating
cycle in which the sample was cooled to −80 °C, heated
to 190 or 230 °C a, and kept for 4 min. The second cooling was
back to −80 °C and then reheating to 190 or 230 °C.
The heating or cooling rate was kept at 10 °C/min for all DSC
cycles.

Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) was tested on a Brucker
D8 X-ray
diffractometer at a scanning rate of 2°/min using Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 200 mA. The samples were
scanned at the range from 5 to 35°.

Dynamic mechanical
analysis (DMA) measurement of the prepared PLA
copolymers blends were carried out by a Q800 DMA instrument with a
liquid nitrogen cooling system with tension mode. The samples were
prepared with length × width × thickness of 30 × 5.0
× 0.3 mm3. The frequency was 1 Hz and the temperature
range was between −100 and 150 °C, with a rate of 3 °C/min.
