Surface modification of atomically
thin semiconductors enables
their electronic, optical, chemical, and mechanical properties to
be tailored and allows these nanosheets to be processed in solutions.
Here, we report first-principles density functional theory calculations,
through which we show chemical functionalization of black phosphorus
using phenyl, phenolate, and nitrene species, which were widely investigated
for carbon-based materials. We find that covalent functionalization
using nitrene-derived species introduces a strong P–N dative
bond at the interface without perturbing its intrinsic electronic
structure. The Lewis basic and nucleophilic P atom attacks, through
a free pair of electrons, the Lewis acidic nitrene species. These
results are further compared to other nitrene-derived functional groups
on black phosphorus, including N-methylbenzene, N-aminobenzene, and N-nitrobenzene. We
find that by tuning the charge redistribution at the interface, the
work function of black phosphorus can be tuned by more than 2 eV.
These results suggest valuable tunability of the electronic properties
of two-dimensional layered black phosphorus by covalent functionalization
for future device applications.

Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D)
black phosphorus (BP),1−4 known as single-layer phosphorene,
is a member of layered-material family consisting of graphene, 2D
hexagonal boron nitride, and transition-metal dichalcogenides, ranging
from semimetals to semiconductors and to insulators. Semiconducting
BP shows a tunable direct band gap, anisotropic optical absorption,
and large carrier mobility, all of which may lead to potential applications
in field-effect transistors and photodetectors.4−8 However, its fast degradation upon exposure to ambient
conditions, resulting from reaction with oxygen,9,10 necessitates
surface functionalization and encapsulation to prepare devices with
long-term stability and reliability.11−13

Chemical functionalization
of atomically thin two-dimensional materials
enables tunable electronic and chemical properties and also allows
solution-based techniques for processing these materials. Covalent
functionalization of pristine graphene and carbon nanotubes has been
widely studied. The rich chemistry of carbon enables various strategies
for introducing foreign groups through covalent bonds, such as using
aryl radicals, cycloaddition, and nitrene addition, or mediated by
surface atomic defects or impurities.14−18 By introducing these radicals onto the surface, the
band gap, electronic conductivity, and solubility of graphene can
be controlled.19−22 Because of the varied chemical properties resulting from different
atoms exposed to the environment, surface modification through covalent
bonds for BP has been challenging compared to graphene. That is, the
P atoms exposed at the surface of BP have distinct chemistries with
respect to C in graphene.

Covalent functionalization of exfoliated
BP remains less explored,
although it may be more crucial because of its fast degradation upon
exposure to ambient conditions.9−12 Within the context of introducing a protective layer
on BP surfaces against ambient degradation, several encapsulation
techniques have been proposed, including the encapsulation of BP with
transparent poly(methyl methacrylate)23 and insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN).24,25 For the same purpose, using trimethylaluminum and H2O
as precursors, a thin AlOx film can be
deposited onto BP flakes by atomic layer deposition.26 Very recently, aryl diazonium chemistry, a widely studied
chemistry for graphene, has been applied to BP and the functionalized
samples have shown enhanced semiconductor performance and improved
chemical stability resulting from the surface passivation.27 However, the aryl group may also introduce a
flat energy band within the band gap of BP, leading to reduced hole
mobility, as shown recently in first-principles calculations.28 Therefore, stable covalent functionalization
of BP to modify its chemical stability and solubility without diminishing
its desirable electronic properties still remains to be developed.

In this study, we report first-principles density functional theory
(DFT) calculations, through which we propose alternate strategies
to modify the BP surface. We apply radical chemistry using three different
radicals, namely, phenyl, phenolate, and nitrene, all of which have
been widely explored previously for surface modification of graphene
and carbon nanotubes, to functionalize BP and examine their adsorption
properties and binding strength. In particular, we show that all of
the three radicals can adsorb on the BP surface. Different adsorption
modes, resulting from the varied electronic structure of the radicals,
affect the electronic properties of BP in a significantly different
way. We show that the nitrene chemistry may be a valuable strategy
for BP functionalization because the interfacial binding is stable
without perturbing the electronic structure of BP, resulting from
a strong P–N dative bond at the interface. Meanwhile, we find
that the formation of dangling bonds is the main cause for defect
levels at the Fermi level in BP when using phenyl and phenolate. We
further compare the results with other nitrene-derived functional
groups on BP, including N-methylbenzene, N-aminobenzene, and N-nitrobenzene. We
show that by tuning the polarity of the molecules the work function
of BP can be tuned by more than 2 eV. These results thus suggest valuable
tunability of the electronic and chemical properties of layered black
phosphorus by covalent functionalization.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
projected density of states (PDOS) of BP with three different functional
groups, namely, phenyl, phenolate, and nitrene species.16 Calculations using HSE06 hybrid functional show
that the pristine BP monolayer has a band gap of 1.34 eV (Figure 1a), which agrees
with reported values.29−31 The adsorptions of phenyl (Figure 1b) and phenolate (Figure 1c) introduces energy levels within the band
gap of pristine BP. These localized states within the band gap are
also found in a recent computational work and may lead to reduced
hole mobility of BP.28 Partial charge density
calculations within an energy window around the Fermi level have been
performed to illustrate the charge distribution (insets in Figure 1). The green-shaded
area in Figure 1b,c
shows the energy window used for integration.

Figure 1 Electronic structure
of BP with different functional groups, (a)
pristine BP, (b) phenyl, (c) phenolate, and (d) nitrene as well as
the optimized structures (insets). Density of states (DOS) of pristine
BP (dashed curve) and projected DOS onto P atoms (solid curves) are
shown for comparison. The black, white, red, blue, and purple balls
denote C, H, O, N, and P atoms, respectively. The shaded areas indicate
the energy window used for charge integration for the whole system.
In (b) and (c), the isosurface of the charge density plot is 0.06
eV Å–3. Configurations of interfacial bonds
formed between functional groups and BP are schematically shown next
to each optimized structure.

We find that the charge around Fermi Level is localized at
the
phosphorus at the opposite site of BP with respect to the surface
being functionalized. As discussed later, this charge localization
is caused by the broken P–P bond upon ligation of the phenyl
(Figure 1b). Because
of the same reason, that is, the newly formed P–O bond replaces
previously existed P–P bond, functionalization using phenolate
creates a very similar electronic structure (Figure 1c). Distinctly, when nitrene was introduced,
the electronic structure of BP, particularly the band-gap and band-edge
energies remain unperturbed compared to the pristine BP. We note that
DFT-Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) calculations show the
same phenomena (Figure S1). The projected
DOS of the C, O, and N in the phenyl, phenolate, and nitrene in the
adsorbed configurations are shown in Figure S2. The overlapping states between C (O) and P in phenyl (phenolate)
at the Fermi level clearly show the orbital hybridization. We also
calculated the band structure of pristine monolayer and nitrene-functionalized
BP using the PBE-D3 method, as shown in Figure S3. The band structure calculations show that adsorption of
nitrene on the BP surface does not perturb the intrinsic electronic
structure of BP. The direct band gap at the Γ point persists.
We note that the band gap is underestimated using PBE calculations
compared to the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) calculations.
All of the discussion here is thus focused on the results calculated
using the hybrid functional.

Table 1 shows the
adsorption energies of these radicals on BP. All of the adsorbates
are strongly bonded to BP, with the adsorption energy increasing from
−1.0 eV for phenolate and −2.1 eV for phenyl to −3.2
eV for nitrene. Among the functional groups examined, phenyl and phenolate
show similar adsorption configurations, in which the adsorption of
phenyl (phenolate) lifts the first-layer P atom 0.165 Å (0.101
Å), pushes the second-layer P atom away 0.292 Å (0.181 Å),
and the corresponding (broken) P–P distance is 2.96 Å
(2.64 Å), which was 2.23 Å in pristine BP. By contrast,
nitrene is more tightly bonded to the P atoms. The addition of nitrene
pushes down the surface P atom 0.108 Å instead of pulling it
outward the sheet. Displacement of the bottom-side P atom is insignificant,
and at the same time, phosphorene possesses a much shorter P–P
bond length (2.21 Å) compared to the other two cases.

(stretching) and toward BP (compression), respectively.

In the following, we show the physical
reason for the varied perturbation
of the electronic structure caused by the different radicals. Figure 2 shows a schematic
representation of the three functional groups: phenyl, phenolate,
and nitrene. The varied frontier orbitals, manifested by the charge
density shown in Figure 2, display the difference between electronic structures of the three
radicals. The phenyl and phenolate have one unpaired electron in the
p orbital, which is also evidenced by the calculated density of states
in Figure S4, whereas the nitrene group
has two valence electrons forming a free electron pair and two remaining
electrons occupying two degenerate p orbitals. This different electron
distribution leads to varied adsorption configurations and energies
on black phosphorus, as discussed later in the text. The density of
states of these ligands is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S4).

Figure 2 Structure and partial charge densities
of (a) phenyl, (b) phenolate,
and (c) nitrene. Black, white, red, and blue balls denote C, H, O,
and N atoms, respectively. The singly occupied molecular orbital of
phenyl and phenolate and highest occupied molecular orbital are shown
on the right panels.

The varied perturbation can thus be explained on the basis
of the
different electronic structures of the radicals and distinct interfacial
chemical bonds. Each phosphorus atom is covalently bonded to three
adjacent phosphorus atoms to form a puckered honeycomb structure32,33 in pristine BP. By forming three bonds with each neighboring P atoms,
each phosphorus atom also has a lone pair of electrons. The strong
interaction between surface P and the unpaired electron in phenyl
groups (P–C bond) leads to the broken P–P bond and localization
of an unpaired p electron on the P atom at the bottom (Figure 1b,c). This unsaturated P atom
at the bottom dominates the charge localized at the Fermi Level.

The strength of interfacial interaction does not correlate with
the amplitude of perturbation of the electronic structure. Although
it has the strongest interaction with the BP surface, the nitrene
group has two valence electrons forming a free electron pair and two
remaining electrons occupying two degenerate p orbitals. When introducing
nitrene to BP, the surface P atom shared its lone pair electrons with
N in nitrene (Figure 1d), forming a dative covalent bond. In other words, the Lewis basic
and nucleophilic P atom at the surface attacks, through the lone pair
of electrons, the Lewis acidic nitrene species. This bond is very
strong and does not need to break the P–P bond, leading to
very stable adsorption of nitrene (Table 1).

The nature of the dative bond is
further supported by analyzing
the charge transfer at the interface. Figure 3 shows the calculated charge transfer between
nitrene and BP. The lone pair electrons of P are shared between P
and N, leading to charge redistribution at the P–N–C
atoms at the interface. The unperturbed band structure of BP upon
adsorption of nitrene may suggest that nitrene-derived species could
be a desirable functional group to functionalize the BP layers. This
hydrophobic functionalization at the surface may help BP to resist
fast degradation upon exposure to mainly water, oxygen, and light.9,10,26

Figure 3 Charge transfer between the nitrene and
BP. The red and blue colors
indicate electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. The value
of isosurface used for plotting the charged density difference is
±0.05 e Å–3. The charge density difference
Δρ is calculated as Δρ = ρ(nitrene/BP)
– ρ(nitrene) – ρ(BP), where the ρ(nitrene/BP),
ρ(nitrene), and ρ(BP) are the charge densities of nitrene
adsorption on BP, isolated nitrene, and isolated BP, respectively,
with the atomic positions also fixed at the optimized adsorption configuration.

Next, to further tune the electronic
property of BP, we have modeled
functionalization of other nitrene-derived groups on phosphorene substrate,
including N-methylbenzene, N-aminobenzene,
as well as N-nitrobenzene, in which CH3 and NH2 are electron-donating groups, whereas NO2 is known to be an electron-withdrawing group. Because N is
more electronegative than C and H, CH3- and NH2-substituted nitrene groups are able to release electrons to their
adjacent parts, whereas N tends to withdraw electrons from ring by
inductive effects. Furthermore, N in NO2-substituted nitrene
possesses a positive charge by donating partially its lone pair electrons
to one of the O atoms, so it tends to withdraw electrons inside to
reduce its positive charge. This charge redistribution at the interface
causes a change of the surface dipole,12 resulting in changes of the work function of the material.34

We calculated the work function of BP
functionalized at only one
side of the pristine BP as well as at both sides, the latter of which
is helpful to reduce dipole interaction resulting from the periodic
boundary condition. The calculated electrostatic potential is shown
in Figure S5. Table 2 shows that among the functional groups examined,
NO2-substituted nitrene-BP shows the highest work function
compared to either pristine or nitrene-BP. Instead, there is a moderate
decrease in the value when nitrene-BP is decorated by NH2, which is one of the electron-donating groups. The electrostatic
potential profile in Figure 4 also shows a shift of vacuum level when Fermi Level is aligned
manually, indicating the strong electron-withdrawing power of NO2. Addition of CH3- and NH2-substituted
nitrene groups results in reduced work function compared to nitrene-BP.
Therefore, by introducing electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
groups into the nitrene groups, we can tune the work function by 2
eV with a rather low coverage of functional groups (one group per
18 surface P atoms). We find that the work function of BP can be further
modified by changing the density of the functional groups, in agreement
with the literature.35 For example, double
the coverage of the NO2-substituted nitrene, the work function
can be increased by an additional 0.7 eV (Table S1).

at both sides, including N-methylbenzene-BP (black
solid curve), N-aminobenzene-BP (blue dotted curve),
and N-nitrobenzene-BP (red dotted curve). Electrostatic
potentials of pristine monolayer BP (purple solid curve) and nitrene-functionalized
BP (green solid curve) are shown for comparison. The black, white,
red, and blue balls denote C, H, O, and N atoms, respectively.

In addition, we calculated the charge transfer that occurs between
the functional group and monolayer black phosphorous by performing
Bader charge analysis,36 as revealed in Table 3. We find that all
functional groups we have covered behave as acceptors, which withdraw
electrons from BP sheet (the negative sign denotes the number of electrons
that transfer from monolayer to functional groups). The changes
in charge transfer upon functionalization are linearly correlated
with the changes in work function.

The tunable work function and band-edge energies are
valuable for
building heterostructures between BP and other two-dimensional materials37 as well as metal oxides.38 It is also desirable to tune the band edges for applications
in electrocatalysis,39 in which the energy
of the conduction and valence band edges should be aligned with the
electrochemical potentials of the redox reactions. In addition, functionalization
of the BP using the hydrophobic nitrene groups may also help to reduce
contact between BP and water, and  it has shown that O2 dissolved in water may cause decomposition of the BP layers.9

Conclusions
We have systematically
investigated the adsorption of phenyl, phenolate,
and nitrene on the basal plane of black phosphorus by means of DFT
computations. We find that nitrene is a desirable functional group
for surface modification of black phosphorus because it shows very
strong thermostability and does not perturb the electronic structures
due to the interfacial dative bond. In addition, functionalization
of black phosphorus via nitrene-derived functional groups can be further
used to tune the work function. The results reported here indicate
that one can tune the substituent groups in the phenyl, phenolate,
and nitrene moieties to tune the charge transfer at the interface,
through which a tunable electronic structure of black phosphorus may
be achieved. The great tunability of the electronic properties of
black phosphorus by covalent functionalization suggests an effective
way to realize its full potential in nanoelectronic and optoelectronic
applications.

Computational Methods
DFT computations
were performed using Vienna ab initio simulation
package.40 The ion–electron interaction
was described through the projector-augmented wave approach.41 For structural optimization, the exchange and
correlation energy was represented using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) functional of the generalized gradient approximation.42 The van der Waals interaction has been taken
into account through Grimme’s DFT-D3 semiempirical method.43,44 To model the monolayer, we used a supercell containing 36 P atoms.
The Brillouin zone was sampled using a k-point mesh
of 3 × 3 × 1 for structural optimizations. A vacuum space
of at least 10 Å was included in the supercell to minimize the
interaction between the system and its replicas resulting from the
periodic boundary condition. A 400 eV cutoff for the plane-wave basis
set was adopted in all computations. The structures were relaxed until
the atomic force is smaller than 0.01 eV Å–1.

The optimized structures were then used for the electronic
density
of states calculations using the HSE06 hybrid functional.45 All of the calculations were performed using
a Gaussian smearing with a width of 0.2 eV. We have tried to increase
the cutoff energy to 500 and 600 eV for the DOS calculations with
a smaller smearing width of 0.02 eV and observed no significant difference
(see Figure S6). For comparison, the DFT-PBE-calculated
electronic structure is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). The calculated electronic structures
using HSE and PBE functionals give the same trend and support the
conclusion. The band gap was calculated on the basis of the eigenstates
at the Γ point in the Brillouin zone of BP. The work function
of pristine and functionalized BP was calculated on the basis of the
difference between the Fermi Level and the vacuum level.

The
adsorption energy of each configuration between the molecule
and the 2D BP is defined by Eads = Etotal – (EBP + Eadsorbate), where Etotal, EBP, and Eadsorbate are the energies of functionalized 2D materials,
pristine 2D materials, and the isolated functional group, respectively.
