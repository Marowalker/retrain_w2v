The effects of particle size, temperature, and leaching
time on the leaching behavior of rare-earth elements were studied.
The leaching efficiency of the rare earth reached 39.24% under leaching
conditions of hydrochloric acid concentration of 8.00 mol/L, particle
size 95% distributed below 1.5 μm, leaching time of 120 min,
and temperature of 90 °C. According to the scanning electron
microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis of the residue, the mechanism
of the leaching process was also investigated. Actually, the phase
of REFCO3 transformed into that of RECl3 and
REF3 but there was an existing intermediate transition,
where the phase of REFCO3 on reacting with hydrochloric
acid generated that of REOxF3–2x and this process also released RE3+ into
the solution. REOxF3–2x continued reacting with hydrochloric acid to release
a lot of F–, which on combining with RE3+ formed REF3 precipitation. The leaching kinetics of rare
earths follows a shrinking core model that can be expressed as 1 –
3(1 – x)2/3 + 2(1 – x) = k1t. The
activation energies are 62.1, 54.8, 35.1, and 34.9 kJ/mol, respectively.

Introduction
As an important strategic resource,
rare earths are widely applied in phosphor light-emitting diodes and
magnetic materials1,2 due to their unique physicochemical
property.3 The majority of the rare-earth
elements’ (REEs) production happens in China, which has a large
number of rare-earth resources.4 As the
world’s largest rare-earth element (REE) mineral deposits,
the Bayan Obo ore deposit has a great variety of minerals and is especially
abundant in iron, rare earth, and niobium, which have an extremely
high comprehensive utilization value. Over the past years, many countries
have begun to treat rare-earth elements as strategic and crucial materials
and started a series of mining and metallurgical activities to meet
the demand for rare-earth elements.5 Among
these activities, the mining of secondary REE-containing resources
is urgently demanded,6 such as stocks of
land-filled industrial process residues, mine tailings, metallurgical
slags,7,8 and end-of-life REE-containing products.9−11 So the research of the Bayan
Obo ore concentrate on rare-earth extraction is of great significance
for the development of the rare-earth industry in China. In the Bayan
Obo rare-earth concentrate, rare-earth elements mainly exist in the
form of bastnaesite and monazite with ratios of 6:4 or 7:3.12,13 So far, there have been developments of many smelting processes,
such as the concentrated sulfuric acid calcining method,14−16 NaOH decomposition methods,17−19 Na2CO3-roasting
decomposition methods,20−22 and
leaching with HCl–AlCl3 solution.23,24 The
method of concentrated sulfuric acid calcining is in widespread use
in the industry. Compared with other methods, this method has a relatively
lower requirement for raw materials as long as the concentrate of
grade reaches 50%. Moreover, sulfuric acid is not only cheap but also
easily available
to solve the corrosion problem. However, a lot of industrial effluents
and waste gas containing F and S are generated in the production process.
In particular, the amount of solid waste is not only large but also
its radioactive intensity exceeds the national standard, causing serious
pollution to the surrounding environment. Furthermore, the treatment
of these wastes also brings about a high cost of disposal. The alkali
decomposition is only mainly applied in treating the concentrate,
whose grades range from 55 to 60%. But there are some critical problems
awaiting to be settled in the smelting process, for instance, expensive
caustic soda price, rare-earth yield lower than that in the acid method,
and the challenge of removing calcium with acid. Ca would also enter
the rare-earth chloride solution in acid solution, affecting the quality
of rare-earth chloride products.

In view of the disadvantages
of the above smelting processes, a new green metallurgical process
is proposed by our research group to treat the mixed rare-earth concentrate,
the specific flow chart of which is shown in Figure 1.25 Bastnaesite
in the mineral could be readily decomposed into REOF accompanied by
release of CO2 during roasting;26,27 then,
a large proportion of the rare-earth elements could be extracted by
HCl. Monazite, mainly consisting of rare-earth phosphates, is highly
stable even at temperatures up to 1500 °C and do not undergo
phase change.28,29 The slag containing monazite
and REF3 was stepwise decomposed to RE(OH)3 by
using NaOH. The product that is mainly composed of RE(OH)3 continues to be combined with the leaching solution after washing
several times so that rare-earth chloride solution could be finally
obtained. In addition, the rinsing solution containing sodium hydroxide,
sodium fluoride, and trisodium phosphate anhydrous could be, respectively,
recovered due to the significant differences in solubility. This process
effectively reduces the production of waste gas in the leaching process
and has the advantages of low production cost and high recovery.

Figure 1 Flow diagram of the smelting concentrate and
material balance of rare-earth elements.

However, most of the rare-earth elements in the bastnaesite are inevitably
oxidized whose valence state increases from trivalent to tetravalent
during roasting.30,31 In the leaching process, by using
hydrochloric acid, the tetravalent rare-earth elements will oxidize
Cl–1 into Cl2, which releases into the
air and causes severe environmental pollution32 so the high cost of a reducing agent must be added to avoid releasing
chlorine in the leaching process, causing the introduction of impurities.
In addition, the waste gas containing F will be also produced during
the roasting process, which will increase the processing cost. Recently,
with continuous updation of the grinding equipment, mineral particle
size refinement has become possible and has been industrialized in
some factories. For heterogeneous reactions, the migration rate of
reactive molecules from one phase to another must be related to the
area of the interface so fine particles react faster than coarse particles
because of the larger surface area of the former.33 Unfortunately, few studies34 have been conducted on the effects of particle size refinement on
the leaching of rare-earth elements in the concentrate. The effect
of different particle sizes, temperature, and time on extraction for
REEs and mechanism of RE leaching after refining the mineral is not
yet clear.

In this paper, the method of mechanical activation
is used to pretreat the concentrate instead of the roasting process.
This mechanical activation method has the advantages of high activation
efficiency and easy operation. It enables the efficient leaching of
rare-earth elements under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, no other
impurities were introduced in the process, which fundamentally solved
the problem of waste gas pollution and waste residue treatment in
the process of rare-earth smelting and roasting. Through increasing
its specific surface area and causing its lattice defects, the activity
of mineral is extremely increased to improve the leaching rate of
rare-earth elements without adding a reducing agent and introducing
impurities. The mixed rare-earth concentrate is finely ground into
different particle sizes by a ball mill. All leaching experiments
were done at different particle sizes, temperature, and time. By analyzing
leaching rate and the phase structure of residue, the leaching regularities
and mechanism of RE are clarified.

Results
and Discussion
Material Characteristics
Figure 2 shows the
X-ray diffractogram (XRD) of the concentrate. The diffraction peak
of REFCO3 and REPO4 could be observed evidently,
which are the main phases of the ore. Without the roasting process,
the bastnaesite is not decomposed in the XRD patterns and all rare-earth
elements in the concentrate are maintained in the trivalent state.
The concentration of fluorine has also not been released into the
atmosphere to cause environmental pollution. In the subsequent process
of removing impurity, the concentration of fluorine will be used in
the production of sodium fluoride, as an important by-product, which
can be used as a pesticides and wood preservatives. This also increases
the economic efficiency and improves the atom economy. Figure 3 shows the microstructure of
the concentrate; it is obvious that the particle surface of bastnaesite
is relatively dense and compact and reacts with difficulty with a
solvent, which may lead to a low leaching rate.

concentrate.

Effect of Temperature and Reaction Time on the Leaching
of Rare-Earth Elements
The effect of temperature and time
on the extraction of rare earths was investigated at 30, 50, 70, and
90 °C for leaching time varied in the range 2–120 min. Figure 5 displays the changes
in the leaching rate with temperature as a function of time. Figure 5a reflects the variation
of the leaching rate of the unground concentrate, and Figure 5b–d, particle size of
the concentrate 95% distributed below (b) 10 μm, (c) 5 μm,
and (d) 1.5 μm. It can be seen from Figure 5 that the leaching rate of rare-earth elements
increased gradually with the increasing temperature. When the temperature
was 30 °C, the acid-leaching reaction was not fierce and the
rare-earth leaching rate increased slowly, but when the temperature
reached 90 °C, the reaction rate could greatly accelerate to
make the bastnaesite come have a better contact with hydrochloric
acid, which could increase significantly up to 39.24%. Within 2–10
min, the reaction between bastnaesite and hydrochloric acid was relatively
severe and the rare-earth leaching rate improved fast. This situation
was particularly obvious under the ground concentrate and the higher
temperature; the extraction of rare-earth elements increased at different
leaching temperatures from 10 to 60 min, as shown in Figure 5. However, the leaching rate
of rare earth increased slowly within 10–60 min. Compared with
the unground concentrate, the particle size refinement mitigates the
downward trend. The extractions were nearly constant after 60 min.
This phenomenon occurred because the recovery of La was maximum at
room temperature. However, the rise in temperature promoted the dissolutions
of Ce and Nd, whose recovery rates were low at room temperature. This
variation in recovery rates of different rare-earth elements at different
temperatures points that it is hard to extract rare-earth elements
completely in one stage, thus causing this trend.35

Effect of Particle Size
on the of
REEs
As can be seen from Figure 4, the particle size D50 of the mixed rare earth before fine grinding was 20.72 μm
and the proportion of the particle diameter below 10 μm was
small. Compared with the concentrate before fine grinding, the particle
size below 10 μm of the finely ground concentrate was obviously
predominant, which can extremely increase the specific surface area
to more fully contact with the solvents and accelerate the reaction
rate to improve the leaching rate of the rare-earth elements. Figure 5 shows that the ratio of rare-earth leaching can be improved
significantly with the refinement of particle size. At 30 °C,
bastnaesite of the mixed rare-earth concentrate without grinding was
hard to be leached, whose leaching rate was only 7.04%; when the mineral
particle size is finely ground from the particle size of 95% below
10 μm to 95% below 5 μm, the leaching rate of rare-earth
elements was improved from 9.87 to 10.13%. In contrast, the leaching
rate of the concentrate (the particle size distribution of 95% under
1.5 μm) reached 15.05% at 30 °C, increasing by 8.01%, even
better than that of the concentrate without grinding at 90 °C.
This may be because the surface of bastnaesite was relatively dense,
leading to insufficient reaction, and the refinement of mineral particle
size can increase the contact area of reactants, greatly accelerating
the reaction between minerals and leaching agents. In the process
of grinding, mineral particles under the action of impact friction
and local high temperature will also lead to the increase of stress
and energy in the lattice; thus, this greatly reduced the reaction
activation energy. Compared with Figure 5a, it can be seen from Figure 5b–d that the variation range of the
rare-earth leaching rate had been remarkably raised with increasing
temperature with the refinement of particle size. For the concentration
without grinding, when the temperature increased from 30 to 90 °C,
the leaching rates were 7.04, 8.42, 9.45, and 10.41% and there was
not much change between them. However, when the mineral particle size
is finely ground to 95% below 10 μm, the leaching rate changes
significantly from 9.87 to 21.48%. With the refinement of the particle
size, this situation obviously occurred, from Figure 5d. The leaching efficiency of REEs (the particle
size distribution of 95% under 1.5 μm) reached 39.24%. It can
be seen that the refinement of particle size and temperature have
a great influence on the leaching rate of rare-earth elements.

Mechanism of the Leaching Process
To further investigate the phase transformation of the mixed rare-earth
concentrate without roasting during leaching, it is necessary to carry
out XRD and SEM analysis of the leaching slag (the particle size of
the concentrate is 95% distributed below 1.5 μm; leaching temperature,
90 °C; reaction time, 120 min). Considering that the leaching
efficiency of the unground ore (unroasted) is low and the leaching
time is longer than that of roasted ore, it is likely that intermediate
products will be produced in the leaching reaction. Figures 6 and 7 show XRD patterns and SEM images of leaching residue-acquired raw
concentrate without stirring, and the finely ground concentrate is
heated at 90 °C for 2 h (particle size of 95% distributed below
1.5 μm).

In Figure 6a, the diffraction peaks of REFCO3, REPO4, and (Ce, La)F3 are obvious. According to the intensity
of the diffraction peaks, it can be concluded that the main phase
of the leaching slag is bastnaesite, followed by monazite and (Ce,
La)F3 phase, with a small amount of (Ce, La)OF phase. This
indicates that a large part of bastnaesite has not been leached for
unground samples. In Figure 6b, the diffraction maximum of REPO4 and (Ce, La)F3 in the leaching residue of the fine grinding concentrate
(particle size of 95% distributed below 1.5 μm) is obvious,
accompanied by the appearance of the peak of REFCO3. This
indicates that the bastnaesite is basically fully leached, which is
also in line with the high leaching rate of the fine grinding concentrate.

Figure 7a reveals
the microstructure of the bastnaesite in the leaching slag for the
unmilled sample. It can be seen from the figure that bastnaesite is
often distributed in a granular manner, with obvious dissolution traces
on the surface and often showing bumpy gullies. Within the bastnaesite,
residual particles of the (Ce, La)OF phase are found. (Ce, La)OF phase
was accidentally discovered in Figure 7b, and its existence was also confirmed by the X-ray
energy spectrum. This is a new phase generated by the unground concentrate
during acid leaching. Figure 7c showed that the (Ce, La)OF phase often retains the crystal
shape of the bastnaesite and the interior of the new phase often contains
the debris of bastnasesite. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
(Ce, La)OF phase is formed by the original deposition of the bastnaesite
during the acid leaching. X-ray energy spectrum analysis of the Figure 7c shows that (Ce,
La)OF phase often contains a small amount of P5+ and Ca2+. These P5+ and Ca2+ are generated
from fluorite and apatite in the ore dissolved during acid leaching
and adsorbed on the surface of (Ce, La)OF phase. However, the (Ce,
La)OF phase was not found in the SEM images of the milled sample.

(Ce, La)F3 phase is also a newly formed material phase
in slag leaching for both the milled sample and unmilled sample shown
in the Figure 7d,e.
In Figure 7d,e, P5+ and Ca2+ are also adsorbed on the surface of
colloidal (Ce, La)F3 phase. (Ce, La)F3 phase
presents the phenomenon of distant deposition. This explains that
a part of bastnaesite will dissolve into the solution in the form
of RE3+ and newly formed (Ce, La)OF phase retained in the
surface. As the reaction continued further, (Ce, La)OF phase also
gradually dissolved into the leaching solution. At the same time,
a huge amount of fluoride ions was immersed into the solution and
combined with RE3+, generating undissolved (Ce, La)F3 precipitation into the leach residue. The leaching residue
(Ce, La)OF as an intermediate, chemical property is very unstable,
and its content is less, which explains why XRD analysis in Figure 6a did not show the
characteristic peak of (Ce, La)OF but the X-ray energy spectrum analysis
results showed the existence of the rare-earth oxide phase whose F:O
ratio is between 3–5 to 1; so the rare-earth oxide phase is
defined as (Ce, La OxF) (x = 0.20–0.33). Figure 7e shows the (Ce, La)F3 phase in the fine grinding
concentrate leaching slag, which is often dispersed with a large number
of monazite and a small amount of bastnaesite due to its coarse particle
size, as shown in Figure 7f.

Figure 7b,e of the SEM images showed that the surface of monazite in the
two acid-leaching residues was relatively smooth and showed no signs
of dissolution, indicating that monazite remained in the leaching
residue without leaching.

According to the above results, the
acid-leaching process of mixed rare-earth concentrate is as follows.
Unlike the REOF in the roasting ore directly leached into the RECl3 solution using HCl, the structure of bastnaesite in the ore
(unroasted) was not decomposed and it would react with hydrochloric
acid (8 mol/L) to form an intermediate product, REOxF. Meanwhile, it also produced RECl3 into the
solution. The chemical properties of the intermediate product REOxF are extremely unstable. It will continue to
react with hydrochloric acid and eventually form RECl3 into
solution. At the same time, a large amount of fluoride ion was poured
into the solution and then the reaction with RE3+ would
generate insoluble (Ce, La)F3 precipitations. REOxF and REF3 would concentrate on the
mineral surface, preventing the hydrochloric acid from continuing
to interact with the ore. This may be the reason why the leaching
rate of the unroasted concentrate is lower than that of the roasted
concentrate and the leaching time is longer. The monazite in the mineral
is not basically leached. The equations of the leaching process are
as follows 1   2   3  The X-ray energy spectrum analysis results
in Figure 7d show that x = 0.20–0.33 in the equation.

Kinetics Study of Leaching Process
Because
of the acid-leaching reaction leveling off after 60 min, the kinetics
could be studied within 60 min. For the leaching process, the shrinking
core model can usually be used to interpret the liquid–solid
reaction.36 The shrinking core models are
normally represented to be the diffusion, chemical, and mixed control
models.37 One of these steps can control
the leaching process. Considering that the leaching efficiency may
be controlled by diffusion through the REOxF and REF3 layer remaining in the ore surface, the kinetic
equation can be showed as follows 4  where x represents the extraction efficiency of
rare-earth elements, t represents leaching time (min),
and k1 represents the rate constant.

To clarify the kinetics of the unground concentrate reacting with
hydrochloric acid, data were fitted against the model. In Figure 8, the plots of 1
– 3(1 – x)2/3 + 2(1 – x) and t at different temperatures indicate
that the kinetic data of the rare-earth elements (shown in Figure 5) was fitted well
to the eq 4 due to high
values of R2. According to the eq 5, Ea could be obtained as follows 5  where k1 represents the rate constant (s–1), T represents the temperature (K), R represents the
universal gas constant, 8.314 J/(K·mol), and Ea represents the activation energy (kJ/mol).

Figure 8 Plots of 1 – 3(1
– x)2/3 + 2(1 – x) and t at different temperatures for
different particle sizes of the mixed
rare-earth concentrate 95% distributed below (b) 10 μm, (c)
5 μm, and (d) 1.5 μm, respectively, and unground concentrate
(a).

Figure 9 presents that In k1 was plotted against T–1. The Ea of the rare-earth
elements under different particle size distributions was calculated
to be 62.1, 54.8, 35.1, and 34.9 kJ/mol, respectively.

Figure 9 Arrhenius plots
of In k1 and T–1 under different particle sizes of the ore 95%
distributed below (b) 10 μm, (c) 5 μm, and (d) 1.5 μm,
respectively, and unground concentrate (a).

The Ea of the reaction controlled by diffusion is
relatively low, typically about 4–12 kJ/mol. Furthermore, the
value of apparent activation energy (>41.8 kJ/mol) is one of the
characteristics of chemical reaction control.38 From Figure 9, with
the increase of the grinding degree, the reaction activation energy
of the concentrate decreased from 62.1 to 34.9 kJ/mol. It can be seen
from Figure 9 that
the fine grinding process can greatly reduce the activation energy
of the concentrate and increase the reaction rate. There is a great
difference between the activation energy of the unground concentrate
and fine ground concentrate. The activation energy of the unground
concentrate is 62.1 kJ/mol, indicating that the influence of chemical
reaction control is greater than that of diffusion control. But the
surface of the unground concentrate was very dense, causing a low
leaching rate from the images of SEM shown in Figure 3. However, the value of Ea (Figure 9b) (the particle size distribution is 95% under 10 μm) is 54.8
kJ/mol, because the degree of fine grinding may not be enough so that
it is controlled by the surface chemical reaction. The value of Ea ((c) and (d) shown in Figure 9) is 35.1 and 34.9 kJ/mol, respectively,
far less than that of the raw concentrate, between 12 and 41.8 kJ/mol,
showing that the extraction process of the concentrate (the particle
size distribution of 95% under 5 and 1.5 μm) within 60 min is
controlled by a combination of chemical reaction and diffusion through
the product layer. Although the process was controlled by a combination
of chemical reaction and diffusion through the product layer, its
chemical reaction step mostly plays a major role. With the decreasing
particle size of the ore, it increases the specific surface area of
the concentrate, causing the effects of diffusion through the layer
to become less obvious.

Conclusions
The leaching rate can be greatly improved after a fine grinding
process. The leaching efficiency of rare-earth elements was affected
by different particle sizes more remarkably than temperature. Rare-earth
extraction in the ore whose particle size is 95% distributed in 1.5
μm can reach 39.24%. XRD patterns of the residue (particle size
of 95% distributed below 1.5 μm) also showed that the bastnaesite
in the ore was nearly decomposed. In the leaching process, bastnaesite
of the unroasted ore was partly generated to REOxF3–2x and some of the
rare-earth elements are released into the solution at the same time.
REOxF3–2x continues to react with hydrochloric acid adding a large amount
of F– into the solution, resulting in the production
of REF3. REOxF3–2x presents the phenomenon of original deposition,
and REF3 precipitation presents the phenomenon of distant
deposition. SEM patterns of the residue also prove the process. The
kinetics of REEs follow the shrinking core model, whose kinetic equation
follows as 1 – 3(1 – x)2/3 + 2(1 – x) = k1t. The value of apparent activation energy is 62.1,
54.8, 35.1, and 34.9 kJ/mol, respectively.

Experimental Section
Materials
The concentrates used in the experiment are obtained from Bayan
Obo deposit, and the mixed rare-earth concentrate was selected by
flotation. The compositions of REFCO3 and REPO4 are, respectively, 78.2 and 21.2% in the ore. The chemical compositions
of the sample are measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectroscopy (ICP-AES) with a Horiba ULTIMA ICP-AES, as shown in Tables 1 and 2. In addition, 8 mol/L of hydrochloric acid is required for
the experiment (diluted by adding deionized water to analyze pure
hydrochloric acid). All aqueous solutions are prepared with deionized
water.

Experimental Procedure
The mixed rare-earth concentrate was finely ground by a ball mill
to 95% below 1.5, 5, and 10 μm, respectively, and the measurement
of mineral particle size distribution was carried out by a laser particle
analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc. LS230). All leaching experiments were
operated in glass products. To keep the reaction at a stable temperature
during acid leaching, a paddle agitator and water bath are used. For
each experiment, 8 mol/L hydrochloric acid was first charged into
the beaker slowly. When the temperature reached the preset value and
became stable, the mixed rare-earth concentrates of different particle
sizes of 20 g were also put into the beaker for the acid-leaching
experiment, respectively, starting to set a timer. During the reaction,
the system was fully mixed with the agitation speed of 300 rpm. After
the reaction reaches the expected time, the solution was filtered
to obtain the leaching solution and slag; the content of rare-earth
elements in the solution and slag was measured separately to gain
the extraction efficiency. To better explore the mechanism of the
leaching process and confirm the existence of intermediate products,
an additional experiment was needed. This experiment was conducted
such that the raw concentrate was leached by hydrochloric acid for
2 h at 90 °C on the premise of not stirring. The compositions
and phases of ore and leaching slag were analyzed by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) conducted on an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical company, the
Netherlands). The microstructure of main components in the concentrate
and residue was observed using a scanning electron microscope. All
experiments were conducted at least three times with ±4% standard
deviation. The results were the average of the three obtained values.
