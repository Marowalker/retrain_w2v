Translational diffusion
of a free substrate in crowded metabolically active spaces such as
cell cytoplasm or mitochondrial matrix is punctuated by collisions
and nonspecific interactions with soluble/immobile macromolecules/macrostructures
in a variety of shapes/sizes. It is not understood how such disruptions
alter enzyme reaction kinetics in such spaces. A novel Monte Carlo
(MC) technique, “residence time MC”, has been developed
to study the kinetics of a simple enzyme–substrate reaction
in a crowded milieu using a single immobile enzyme in the midst of
diffusing substrates and products. The reaction time lost while the
substrate nonspecifically interacts or is transiently trapped with
ambient macromolecules is quantified by introducing the residence
time “tau”. Tau scales with the size of crowding macromolecules
but makes the knowledge of their shape redundant. The residence time
thus presents a convenient parameter to realistically mimic the sticky
surroundings encountered by a diffusing substrate in heterogeneously
crowded physiological spaces. Results reveal that for identical substrate
concentration and excluded volume, increase in tau significantly diminished
enzymatic product yield and reaction rate, slowed down substrate/product
diffusion, and prolonged their relaxation times. A smooth transition
from the anomalous subdiffusive motion to normal diffusion at long
time limits was observed irrespective of the value of tau. The predictions
from the model are shown to be in qualitative agreement with in vitro
experimental data revealing the rate of alkaline phosphatase-catalyzed
hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in the midst
of 40/500/2000 kDa dextrans. Our findings from the residence time
MC model also attempt to rationalize previously unexplained experimental
observations in crowded enzyme kinetics literature. Furthermore, major
insights to emerge from this study are the reasons why free diffusion
of the substrate in crowded physiological spaces is detrimental to
enzyme function. It is argued that organized enzyme clusters such
as “metabolon” may perhaps exist to regulate the substrate
translocation in such sticky physiological spaces to maintain optimal
enzyme function. In summary, this work provides key insights explaining
why absence of substrate channeling can dramatically slow down enzyme
reaction rate in crowded metabolically active spaces.

1 Introduction
Crowding
by biomacromolecules, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and membranes,
is an all pervasive phenomenon in intracellular milieu’s such
as cell cytoplasm (site for glycolysis),1−4 mitochondrial matrix (site for tricarboxylic
acid cycle),5,6 and red blood cell interiors.7 Recent reports suggest that cytoplasm of a prokaryotic
cell may not be uniformly crowded but possess supercrowded multiplexes
along with relatively uncrowded reservoirs.8 Biochemical reaction kinetics in an intracellular environment can
be fundamentally different from a test tube where reactants are dilute
and perfectly mixed. It has been argued that in a nonhomogeneous crowded
milieu, the law of mass action can break down and reactions may follow
fractal-like kinetics.9−11

Diffusion enables substrates find their target
enzyme active site within the limited dimensions of the animal cell
(∼15 μm). Diffusion of a substrate in the intracellular
milieu can be slowed by nonspecific (soft) interactions with crowding
macromolecules and higher ambient microviscosity. Fluorescence recovery
after photobleaching results of a fluorescent probe in cytoplasm12−14 and mitochondrial matrix5 have shown
that this slowing occurs chiefly due to frequent collisions of the
small molecule (probe) with cell solids which comprise 13–15%
of isosmotic cell volume.12 Such collisional
encounters may transiently trap an intermediate/substrate of a metabolic
pathway and slow down the metabolism. Measuring metabolite levels
inside living cells has proved to be a challenging experimental task
in itself.15−19 It has been shown that molar concentration of an enzyme active site
exceeds free substrate concentration in glycolytic pathways of rat
or rabbit muscle,20 hinting that free substrate
cannot meet urgent metabolic demands. Measured diffusion coefficients
of metabolites such as ATP inside the skeletal muscle21 or rat cardiomyocytes22 are
1.4–3.5 times slower compared to aqueous solutions, perhaps
partly owing to gluey surroundings. Transient binding and unbinding
of a protein to a fixed anchor in the membrane has been shown to lead
to anomalous diffusion.23 Binding of sequential
enzymes in the glycolytic pathway to filaments has also been investigated.24 Given that all 10 enzymes in the glycolysis
pathway are in the cytosol,25 the likelihood
of a metabolite intermediate getting transiently entrapped in the
crowded cytosol is a distinct possibility.

It is hence important
to create a model to investigate how such soft interactions of the
substrate (metabolite) with surrounding macromolecules (crowders or
obstacles) influences the kinetics of an enzymatic reaction? For this
purpose, the vast heterogeneity in shapes and sizes among the crowders
in the cell interior must be accounted. Faithful representation of
such morphological diversity among crowding macromolecules (Figure 1) in a lattice model
can be tedious. Past attempts include assigning square26 or cubic spaces27 in the lattice, but these fall short in reproducing the sheer variety
in crowder shapes. Here in this work, we attempt to address this challenge
by modeling the nonspecific interaction of a substrate with an immobile
crowding obstacle in a novel way that quantifies the interaction time,
while making the shape of the crowder redundant.

Figure 1 The Crowded Cell. The
diversity in shapes and sizes of obstacles encountered by a substrate
(filled grey circles) in a crowded cell cytoplasm is illustrated schematically
(not to scale). The enzyme is represented by a cross in the center.

A tiny solute or substrate (∼500
Da) in a crowded space such as cell cytoplasm encounters myriad barriers
of an assortment of shapes and sizes (Figure 1) in its diffusive path. The translational
diffusion of this substrate in such a milieu is hindered by three
main factors.12 These are: (a) crowding
by large macromolecules or immobile structures that effectively reduce
the available volume in the medium. As a result, the substrate encounters
frequent collisions in its path, occasionally getting trapped locally
within or between barriers; (b) binding transiently to obstacles in
the medium; and (c) higher fluid-phase viscosity in the medium. Experiments
have shown that factors (a) and (b) are the chief determinants for
retarding solute translation in the cell cytoplasm. The complex interactions
of a substrate or product with a macromolecule that include ballistic
collisions, trapping, and transient binding are expected to scale
up with macromolecular size. As the size of a macromolecule increases
so does its exposed surface area available for the interaction with
the substrate. The time spent by a substrate on the surface or accessible
interior of the macromolecule is expected to rise with the macromolecule
size because of transient but frequent substrate–macromolecule
interactions aside from the strength of binding, which is likely to
be weak and uniform. The diffusion of a substrate in a crowded milieu
is therefore slowed down by two factors: (a) population density of
the macromolecules (accounted by area fraction in a 2D lattice) and
(b) size of the macromolecule with which it is interacting. In a dynamical
process, such slowing down can be accounted for by introducing interaction
time or residence time, τ. The residence time approach clearly
decouples excluded volume effects from the size of the crowder. The
former is now solely accounted by the population density of the crowder.
It is thus intriguing to investigate the enzyme kinetics in a crowded
milieu as a function of size and concentration of crowding macromolecules.

Several workers have in the past tried to model enzyme reactions
in crowded media using Monte Carlo (MC) approaches in both two9,28,29 and three dimensions.26,30 To the best of our knowledge, residence time MC approach has not
been applied by any so far. We believe that residence time is a realistic
mimic of the unproductive encounters suffered by the substrate in
a crowded cellular interior before it undergoes reaction.

In
this paper, an approach based on nonequilibrium dynamics of enzymatic
reactions in the diffusion-limited regime is considered. The objective
is to understand qualitatively the influence of crowding by macromolecules
of several different sizes on the rate of diffusion-limited enzymatic
reactions governed by nonequilibrium thermodynamics. A simple numerical
model in two dimensions (2D) based on molecular diffusion in disordered
systems coupled with enzymatic reaction is proposed here. It is predicted
that the rate of a diffusion-limited enzyme-catalyzed reaction will
experience a monotonic decrease with increase in the fractional volume
occupancy of the crowding agent and with the residence time that reflects
the molecular size of the crowding obstacle. Subsequently, the results
from the numerical model are compared with experimental findings obtained
by measuring the enzymatic rate of alkaline phosphate-catalyzed hydrolysis
of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) in an aqueous medium
crowded with dextran of molecular weight: 40, 500, or 2000 kDa present
in a range of concentrations from 0 to 20% w/w. These predictions
are shown to be in qualitative agreement with experimental observations
carried out in vitro. Furthermore, our model is taken up to explain
previous experimental results in literature. The implications of our
model in understanding substrate diffusion inside crowded metabolically
active spaces are discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Alkaline Phosphatase-Catalyzed Hydrolysis in a Crowded Medium
Experimentally measured initial reaction rates for alkaline phosphatase
(enzyme, homodimer mol wt ∼160 kDa)-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (substrate, mol wt 220 Da) in the
presence of increasing dextran (40, 500, and 2000 kDa) size are presented
here. This enzyme–substrate pair was chosen because (A) enhancement
of enzymatic rate arising from increase in thermodynamic activity
of alkaline phosphatase from dextran crowding is negligible as shown
previously by our lab31 and (B) size of
the homodimeric enzyme is large enough (>140 kDa) to be sensitive
to crowding by larger dextrans (>400 kDa) based on the discussion
presented later. The 2000 kDa dextran was specifically chosen to bring
out the role of increased nonspecific binding of the substrate to
the dextran. This will enable comparison of the results with the model
to be presented later.

Figure 2a shows gradual decrease in the reaction rate with
increasing volume fraction (proportional to % w/w) of 40 kDa dextran.
As the molecular size of dextran increases to 500 kDa, the decline
in enzymatic rate appears more pronounced especially for higher volume
fractions (20 and 25% w/w). This trend continues further for 2000
kDa dextran, where the rate drops to ∼50% at 20% w/w of this
dextran size. Figure 2b shows a plot of Figure 2a data as a function of dextran size for different volume
fractions. It is observed that significant slowing of reaction occurs
only at high volume fractions (20 and 25% w/w) of 40 and 500 kDa dextrans.
However, in presence of the largest dextran employed (2000 kDa), the
slowing of reaction rate appears noticeable from 5% w/w itself. Further
increase in volume fraction of this dextran (10–20% w/w) has
a marked effect in slowing down the enzymatic reaction. Intriguingly,
although the presence of 15% w/w of 500 kDa dextran had no measurable
effect on the reaction rate, the presence of 2000 kDa at the same
volume fraction slowed down the reaction by ∼20%. Such a dip
in the rate cannot be accounted by excluded volume effects alone,
especially as no measurable change was observed for the same volume
fraction between 40 and 500 kDa dextran. Previous results31 have demonstrated that conventional Michaelis–Menten
kinetics is not applicable in a crowded medium which is far from ideal,
where mixing is not uniform, law of mass action can break down, and
rate constants can be time dependent.9,10 For this reason,
measurements of enzyme kinetic parameters were not pursued.

sizes. (a) Plot of average normalized reaction rate of alkaline phosphatase-catalyzed
hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in the presence

concentration (in % w/w). (b) Plot of the same normalized rate against
dextran molecular weight (proportional to residence time in the model)
for different dextran concentrations.

2.2 Questions Posed by Experimental Data
(a) Results from Figure 2a reveal that at a constant volume fraction of 15%, crowding by 2000
kDa dextran exerts a marked decrease in catalytic activity in contrast
to that by 40 or 500 kDa. Specifically, such effects appear more pronounced
when size and density of the crowder is large. How can this be explained?

(b) Pastor et al. have studied
the effect of crowding dextrans in a variety of sizes on the reaction
rate of three different enzymes.32 They
showed that smaller enzymes (<42 kDa) showed no change in reaction
rate when dextran size was raised from 50 to 150 kDa. However, with
larger enzymes (∼140 kDa), reaction velocity decreases with
the increasing dextran size (50–410 kDa) when higher concentrations
of dextran (>50 mg/mL) are employed. How does enzyme size modulate
the effects of dextran crowding on reaction kinetics?

(c) As described in the Introduction, it is not clear why are free glycolytic metabolites
so scarce to find in rat/rabbit muscle?

(d) Why is the diffusion coefficient of ATP inside
skeletal muscle and rat cardiomyocytes slowed down by 1.5–3.4
fold?



To seek answers to the above questions,
we put forward the residence time MC model described below. We chose
a 2D model to keep things simple.

2.3 The Model
At any instance of time, t, the system is composed
of substrates S, an enzyme E, macromolecules (or obstacles) O, and
products P. The spatial positions of E and O are kept fixed throughout
the simulation. It is assumed that S and P both interact with the
macromolecules O. But O, which are inert, neither interact with the
enzyme E nor influence the enzymatic reaction directly. Diffusion
of S and P in the system is modeled by random walk. During diffusion,
every interaction of S with the enzyme E leads to immediate conversion
of S to P. If S or P collide with an obstacle O, they interact with
O for a while and are subsequently released. Hence, the above process
of the enzymatic reaction can be represented as 1  where OS and OP represent
the interacting states of S and P with O, respectively. The lifetimes
of OS and OP are proportional to the size of the macromolecule and
represented by the parameter called “residence time”,
τ. For simplicity, the residence time of OS and OP are assumed
to be the same. Note that, the equilibrium Michaelis–Menten
reaction reduces here to an irreversible one by instantaneous conversion
of S to P. The final equilibrium state corresponds to conversion of
all S to P. The model without incorporation of the residence time, τ,
has been explained previously.29

A residence time MC algorithm is developed to study diffusion-limited
enzymatic reactions given in eq 1 taking concentration and size of the macromolecules as parameters.
The algorithm is developed on a square lattice of size L × L defined on the xy-plane
in 2 dimensions (2D). All elements, S, P, O, and E are represented
as point particles in this model. As the interaction of S and P with
a macromolecule is proportional to its size, the size of a macromolecule
in this model is taken care in terms of the interaction time of S
or P with O and is represented by the size dependent residence time,
τ. The size of the enzyme is reduced to a point particle just
to reduce the complexity of the problem. The single enzyme is placed
at the center of the lattice, and S and O are distributed randomly
over the rest of the lattice sites with their respective concentrations, CS and CO. A lattice
site is either empty or occupied by any one of the elements. As E
and O remain immobile throughout the simulation, the diffusion of
S and P in the crowded milieu is studied in the following manner.
Depending on the status of the destination site, there are four possibilities:
(a) if the destination site is empty, S or P moves to the destination
site from the present site, (b) if the destination site is occupied
by another S or P, they remain on the same site and no displacement
occurs, (c) if the destination site is occupied by an O, P or S remains
on the same site for τ MC time steps, and (d) if the destination
site is occupied by the enzyme E, P remains on the same site but S
is converted to P with unit probability. The interaction time between
the enzyme and the product is neglected in this model. As soon as
all S and P are checked for an attempt of motion, time, t (the MC time step), is increased to t + 1. The
maximum area fraction, af = CS + CO taken is 0.4, far below
the percolation threshold of ≈0.59 for the site percolation
on the square lattice.33 Cyclic boundary
condition has been applied for the motion of S and P in both x and y directions. Reaction kinetics is
monitored by keeping track of population of products formed and the
average diffusion length of product molecules from the center of the
lattice as a function of MC time steps.

System morphology for
three different values of τ = 0, 2, and 8 at MC step, t = 212, 218, and 220 are
shown in Figure 3 for
a system with af = 0.1 and CS = 0.01. It can be seen that the substrates (black dots)
are converted to products (gray squares) and are uniformly distributed
over the lattice. For τ = 0, the macromolecules are simple obstacles
and correspond to hindrance to diffusion. The conversion rates decrease
significantly with increasing residence time, τ, as there are
more and more unreacted substrates left for higher values of τ.
Interestingly, at t = 220, although there
are no substrates in the immediate vicinity of the enzyme for τ
= 0 and 2, a significant substrate population in close vicinity of
the enzyme is observed for τ = 8.

Figure 3 The model. System morphology
at MC step (a) t = 212; (b) t = 218; and (c) t = 220 for
three different values of τ = 0 (top), 2 (middle), and 8 (bottom)
is shown with af = 0.1 and CS = 0.01. The black dots represent the substrate S and
the gray squares represent the product P. The single enzyme is shown
by a cross at the center of the lattice. For clarity, obstacles are
not shown.

To have a qualitative explanation
of the experimental results, estimates of initial reaction rates,
diffusivity, and system relaxation are made below for different parameter
sets.

2.4 Results Obtained Using the Model
Simulations were carried out for 220 (a little more than
a million) MC time steps on a 256 × 256 square lattice. The data
are averaged over 100 ensembles. There are two parameters in the system,
the crowder concentration, (CO), and residence
time, τ (macromolecular size). The system is studied for different
area fractions, af = CS + CO, and for different
residence times, τ, for a given CS to observe the effect of crowder concentration and that of the size
of the macromolecules on the yield of the enzymatic reaction. The
enzymatic reactions are characterized mainly by calculating reaction
rates and diffusivity of the system.

2.4.1 Reaction
Rate
To calculate the kinetic reaction rate, the number of
products, NP(t), is recorded
with time, t, the MC time step for a given area fraction af, and residence time, τ. At any instant
of time, the total number of molecules, that is the number of substrate
and product molecules, in the system is conserved and is given by NS(t) + NP(t) = NS(0),
where NS(0) = CS × L2 is the number of substrate
molecules initially given. As per equilibrium reaction kinetics, it
is expected that the total number of products, NP(t), at any time, t, is
given by 2  where α is the reaction rate constant. To study the effect
of af and τ on the time evolution
of the yield, the relative yields, NP(t)/NS(0), are plotted against
time, t, for different values of af, for fixed CS = 0.01, and
τ = 0 in Figure 4a and for different values of τ for fixed af = 0.1 and CS = 0.01 in Figure 4b. The yield, NP, increases slowly initially, followed by a
rapid increase, and finally saturates in the long time limit irrespective
of the parameter values. For low af or
small τ, it can be seen that the reaction is almost complete,
that is, substrates given initially are fully converted to products.
However, there is a considerable decrease in the product yield with
increase in af and with increase in τ.
With higher values of τ and af,
the reactions appear slow and remain incomplete after t = 106 MC steps. It has been predicted by numerical simulations
that classical Michaelis–Menten kinetics may not apply to enzymatic
reactions in crowded media.9 In a 1D model
of reaction diffusion with disorder, Doussal and Monthus34 also found large time decay in the species density
via real space renormalization group calculations. As most molecular
processes are characterized by the initial rate of an enzymatic reaction,
it is estimated keeping only the linear term of the exponential series
in eq 2. To collect data
in the linear regime of the reaction kinetics, the yield is calculated
after 20% conversion of the substrates to products for a given parameter
set. The effects of area fraction, af,
and residence time, τ, on the reaction rates are shown in the
insets of Figure 4a,b,
respectively. For τ = 0, the effect of area fraction, af, on α is studied for two different substrate
concentrations, CS = 0.01 and CS = 0.10. There are a few things to notice.
First, α is decreasing with the increase in area fraction, af, for a given CS in a nonlinear fashion as it is observed in experiments.35−37 Note that the thermodynamic effect of crowding on enzyme activity
is neglected here. As a consequence, the observed dependence of the
reaction rate on crowder concentration is different from the prediction
made by Ellis.38 Second, at any given area
fraction, af, there is a subtle increase
in α with the increase in CS due
to the increased likelihood of enzyme–substrate encounter at
a higher CS. Third, α is approaching
zero as the area fraction, af, approaches
1 – pc ≈ 0.4, where pc ≈ 0.59 is the percolation threshold
on a square lattice.33 For af > 0.4, the spanning path of the empty sites may get
blocked as the concentration of empty sites would become less than
60%. Consequently, the substrate molecules are trapped within the
dangling ends of the clusters formed by the obstacles and unable to
encounter the enzyme. As a result, α is expected to decrease
and go to zero at high area fraction. The effect of macromolecular
obstacle size on the reaction rate, α, is another important
aspect to look into. As the obstacle size is represented by τ,
the variation of the reaction rate, α, against τ for two
different area fractions, af = 0.1 and af = 0.2, for a given substrate concentration, CS = 0.01 are shown in the inset of Figure 4b. The reaction rate
drops substantially as τ becomes nonzero and decreases further
as τ increases. In fact, α ≈ 0 at τ = 32.
The drop in α in this case is because of the fact that, for
a fixed af, as τ increases, the
interactions of S and P with O increase and both of them remain immobile
for some time that is proportional to τ. As a result, the substrate
enzyme interaction becomes less frequent and the product yield decreases.
This event captures qualitatively the situation where the substrate
molecules are trapped or bound to a macromolecule for longer and longer
periods. It can also be noticed that for a given τ, α
is less for af = 0.2 compared to af = 0.1. This difference diminishes with increase
in τ. As τ increases, the effect of τ predominates
over the effect of crowding exerted by the higher area fraction. af. 3

= 0 and (b) for different residence time, τ, keeping CS = 0.01, af = 0.1.

and 0.1 (squares) with τ = 0 is shown in the inset of (a), whereas
the same against τ for af = 0.1
(circles) and 0.2 (squares) with CS =
0.01 is displayed in the inset of (b).

2.4.2 Diffusivity
Enzyme reaction inside
a cell cytoplasm involves several steps, namely, (i) diffusion of
a large number of substrate molecules through the complex milieu of
inert macromolecules, (ii) reaction of substrate with the enzyme to
yield products, and (iii) finally, diffusion of products away from
the enzyme (sometimes as target substrate for the next enzyme in the
pathway) through the same complex milieu of macromolecular crowding.
The diffusion process occurring here involves the collective motion
of a large number of particles in presence of disorder, which is a
more complex process than diffusion of a single tracer particle in
a disordered medium. The macromolecules surrounding the E, S, or P
are inert in the sense that they do not influence the enzymatic reaction.
However, the inert macromolecules could trap S or P when they come
in contact during diffusion. In that sense, they are “active”
disorder and one needs to study the diffusion of S or P in presence
of such “active” disorder. Generally, diffusion is modeled
by random walk, and the disordered system is modeled by spanning percolation
clusters.33 For studying diffusion, a quantity
of interest is the root mean square (rms) distance, r(t), covered by the diffusing particle in time, t. The rms distance, r(t), in 2D is given by 4  where D is the diffusivity of the
system and k is an exponent which has a value 1/2
for diffusion on a regular lattice. On the percolation cluster, diffusion
is found to be anomalous and the value of k becomes
less than 1/2.39,40 To check whether the enzyme kinetic
reaction considered here is diffusion limited or not, the rms distance, r(t), traveled by the product P after its
birth in the vicinity of the enzyme is recorded in time, t. The data is then sample averaged over 100 ensembles. To analyze
the diffusive behavior of the system, the local exponent, kt, and the diffusivity, D, are estimated using eq 5. 5  The effect of area fraction, af, and the residence time, τ, on kt and D is
studied. For τ = 0, D is plotted against af for CS = 0.01
and CS = 0.10 in Figure 5a and for af =
0.1 and 0.2 with CS = 0.01, it is plotted
against τ in Figure 5b. Variations of kt with time, t, for these parameters are shown
in the inset of the respective figures. The diffusivity, D, is found to decrease with both af and
τ. At the same time, it is important to notice that the exponent, kt, approaches to a value 1/2
in the limit t → ∞, irrespective of
the values of af and τ. This is
because at the start of the reaction, the system is not at equilibrium.
As time progresses, the dynamic events make the system evolve and
find its way. This enables diffusion to take shape and dominate. However,
in a previous study,30 certain anomalous
behavior of kt was observed
in the case of low substrate concentration, CS = 0.01, but high area fraction, af = 0.4, with τ = 0. Such effect could arise if the products
get trapped in a localized region without any connectivity path of
empty sites. Saxton has shown that diffusion becomes more anomalous
when obstacle concentration approaches percolation threshold.41 In the long time limit, the process is then
diffusive. It is interesting to note that the decrease in D with the increase in af or
τ is in accordance with the decrease of the reaction rate, α,
with the increase of the respective parameters (Figure 4, inset). The enzymatic reaction rate in
these parameter regimes is therefore mostly governed by diffusion
and can be considered a purely diffusion-limited enzymatic reaction.
For a given area fraction, af, as the
substrate concentration, CS, is increased
the diffusivity, D, is also marginally higher. Such
increase in D is due to the fact that at higher CS, the immobile obstacle concentration is less
for a given af. Hence, the products have
more free space to diffuse. On the other hand, for a fixed value of
τ and CS, if af is increased, D is decreased due to macromolecular
crowding. It is more important to note that for a given CS and af, if τ is increased,
the diffusivity is found to decrease due to enhanced macromolecule–product
(or substrate) interaction. Therefore, with the same CS and af, crowding macromolecules
with higher residence time affect the diffusivity and the enzymatic
reaction rate more compared to those with lower residence time. Thus,
increased stickiness of the crowder can profoundly diminish substrate
diffusion and consequently the enzymatic reaction rate.

time, and diffusion. (a) Plot of D against af for CS = 0.01
(circles) and 0.10 (squares) with τ = 0. (b) Plot of D against τ for af = 0.1
(circles) and 0.2 (squares) with CS =
0.01. In the inset of (a), kt is plotted against log2t for
several values of af (legend symbols correspond
to the same values of af as shown in Figure 4a) with CS = 0.10 and τ = 0; whereas the same are plotted
for several values of τ (legend symbols correspond to the same
values of τ as shown in Figure 4b) with af = 0.2 and CS = 0.01 in inset of (b).

2.4.3 Relaxation Time
The decrease in
diffusivity and the enzymatic reaction rate can also be understood
in terms of relaxation time, τR. It is defined as
the average time required to make a single move during the random
walk of t MC time steps. The relaxation time, τR, is defined as 6  where Nm(j) is the number
of moves made by the jth product (or substrate) during
the period of random walk of Tj MC steps, that is the total number of attempts a random walker
made during the walk and averaged over total number of diffusing particles, NS(0). Either due to absence/presence of crowding
or due to the absence/presence of residence time, the product (or
the substrate) can/cannot make a move to a nearest neighboring position
in each and every MC time step. The relaxation time, τR, is then a measure of the average time taken to make a single move.
In Figure 6, 1/τR is plotted against af in (a)
and against τ in (b). It can be seen that the inverse relaxation
time, 1/τR, is decreasing (or the relaxation time
is increasing) with increasing af or τ.
From Figure 6a, it
is evident that CS has a little effect
on the relaxation of the system. On the other hand, area fraction, af, and the residence time, τ, has a strong
effect on the relaxation of the system. Because the relaxation time
of the system is increasing with af and
τ, the diffusivity of the system has to decrease and as a consequence
the enzymatic reaction rate would be diminished.

and 0.10 (squares) with τ = 0. (b) Plot of 1/τR against τ for af = 0.1 (circles)
and 0.2 (squares) with CS = 0.01.

In both Figures 5b and 6b, it is interesting
to observe that rate of decrease in D and 1/τR is reduced at low af (∼0.1)
and moderate τ (1–2). This mild enhancement of diffusion
in the presence of attractive crowders has been predicted before.42 We now compare results obtained from the model
with experimental observations and prevailing views on crowding inside
cells.

2.5 Our Model and Experimental
Data
There is now a growing consensus that crowded spaces
such as cell cytoplasm cannot be regarded as a mixed bag of proteins
where excluded volume effects alone dominate.43 A polymeric crowding sensor based on fluorescence resonance energy
transfer revealed no compression inside the cell, suggesting minimal
role for excluded volume effects.44 Weak
“quinary” interactions between a macromolecule and its
surroundings can create spatial networks of macromolecules that can
define functional regions in cells.45,46 The view that
metabolic reactions in cytoplasm or mitochondrial matrix are carried
out in enzyme complexes clustered together by quinary interactions
(metabolon)47,48 and driven by substrate channeling49−51 is gaining acceptance. Indeed, a randomly scattered set of enzymes
in a metabolic pathway will experience slowed reaction rates,52 owing to diminished presence of metabolic intermediates
at the active site, random diffusion of substrates, and nonspecific
interactions of the substrate with surrounding crowder macromolecules
as revealed by the proposed residence time MC model. Our model underscores
the enormous entropic advantage accrued by sequential ordering of
enzymes.

Measurement of experimental residence times of small
molecules inside living cells is currently a challenging task. Residence
time of rRNA transcription termination factor mTTF-1 tagged with EGFP
in the nucleus of HeLa cells was measured to be 13 s.53 In absence of such data, the presented model predicts that
even in the midst of moderate levels of crowding, (af = 0.1–0.2), increased nonspecific association
of the substrate can seriously impede its diffusion, leading to steep
drop in enzyme reaction rates.

2.5.1 Model Explaining Alkaline Phosphatase Hydrolysis Results (Q. 2.2a)
The results
shown in Figure 2a
are qualitatively similar to the decrease observed in the reaction
rate (Figure 4a (inset))
and diffusivity, D (Figure 5a), with increasing area fractions of the
point obstacle. In Figure 2b, the size of dextran can be assumed to scale with the residence
time used in the model. Dextran is a flexible ribbon-like polymer.54 A higher molecular weight of dextran is likely
to offer a larger surface area, which can bind/trap the substrate
(PNPP) for sufficiently longer residence and relaxation times. Thus,
it is evident that influence of residence time on the reaction rate
predominates over excluded volume effects when size of the crowding
obstacle is large (∼2000 kDa) or when volume fraction of a
moderately sized crowding agent (∼500 kDa dextran) is high
(>15% w/w). The above result is qualitatively similar to the decrease
observed in the reaction rate [Figure 4b (inset)] and diffusivity, D (Figure 5b), with increasing
residence times of point obstacles. The trend observed with reciprocal
relaxation time (Figure 6) also mirrors the results shown in Figure 2. Thus, increased stickiness of the crowder
can profoundly diminish substrate diffusion and consequently the enzymatic
reaction rate. This is in agreement with previous experimental results
where larger molecular weight dextrans slowed the rate of alkaline
phosphatase-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl
phosphate noticeably more than smaller dextrans.31

For a quantitative comparison of the results from
the model with experimental results in Figure 2, a 3D model is necessary with further refinements
such as: (i) modifying the interaction between the obstacle and substrate
in terms of one or more intermediate steps; and (ii) a distribution
of residence times to match the complexity of the intracellular milieu.

2.5.2 Model Explaining Pastor and Co-Worker’s Results (Q. 2.2b)
Our results explain
why effects of crowding by large obstacles are more pronounced with
enzymes of larger size compared to smaller size. The ratio of enzyme
active site area to its total exposed surface area decreases rapidly
as enzyme size increases. This makes the search for the active site
in the larger enzyme more tortuous for the diffusing substrate. For
identical amounts of excluded volume, the presence of small crowders
will hold back the substrate for shorter residence times in comparison
to larger crowders (which have higher surface area to trap the substrate),
implying that when enzymes are small, reaction velocity is predominantly
affected by excluded volume.45 Thus, larger
crowders exacerbate the slow reaction rate in larger enzymes by increasing
residence time of the substrate that already has a tortuous path to
navigate to find the target active site.

The results from our
numerical model involving a single enzyme, surplus single substrate,
and numerous point obstacles clearly establish the role of volume
exclusion and residence time in slowing down the enzymatic reaction
rate.

2.5.3 Q.2.2c
Free glycolytic metabolites
are scarce to find in rat/rabbit muscle because they are more likely
to be nonspecifically bound to crowding macromolecules in the muscle
interior.

2.5.4 Q.2.2d
Diffusion
coefficient of ATP is likely to be slowed inside skeletal muscle/cardiomyocytes
for chiefly two reasons: (i) increased fluid viscosity that it experiences
and (ii) frequent collisions and nonspecific interactions of ATP with
surrounding macromolecules, which can increase the residence time
of bound ATP.

2.5.5 Model Explaining Other
Data in Literature
There
have been numerous studies on the influence of crowding agents such
as dextrans,31,55,56 Ficolls,31,36 proteins,56,57 or poly(ethylene glycol)37 on enzyme
kinetics in vitro. However, only a few studies have accounted for
the role of nonspecific binding presumably because either such binding
is hard to measure experimentally or the size of the crowders employed
were much less than 2000 kDa making such binding irrelevant. Wenner
and Bloomfeld found increased nonspecific binding of substrate/product
to Ficoll 70 during EcoRV-catalyzed cleavage of DNA. However, they
observed that reaction velocity was nearly unaffected presumably because
of the small size (70 kDa) and compact nature of Ficolls compared
to dextrans.36 Interestingly, work by Poggi
and Slade suggests that nature of the crowder (neutral vs charged)
can also play a role in influencing the enzyme kinetic parameters.56 They observed increased Vmax for anionic substrates in the presence of highly charged
crowders such as hen lysozyme in contrast to neutral crowders such
as dextrans. Perhaps reduced nonspecific binding of the substrate
with lysozyme owing to electrostatic repulsions may have contributed
to increased enzymatic activity in comparison to dextrans. Often crowding
effects can be complicated by oligomerization of the enzyme which
may enhance or diminish the activity.57 Recently, Zotter et al. measured enzymatic activity of TEM1 β-lactamase
inside living HeLa cells. They observed a reduced catalytic efficiency
for the enzyme in vivo compared to in vitro.58 The reduced activity of the enzyme was chiefly attributed to attenuated
diffusion of the substrate inside the cell owing to interactions with
cell components. Their results clearly suggest that the amount of
free substrate in the cell interior is significantly lower than the
total substrate, consistent with our arguments here. These data reinforce
further the role of sticky substrate as an enzymatic rate-limiting
factor inside the living cell and make our model pertinent.

The enzymatic reaction considered here is completely diffusion limited,
and the results obtained are explainable in terms of diffusion in
disordered systems. It is therefore intriguing to note that such a
simple model of enzymatic reaction based on diffusion and percolation
phenomena only is able to explain qualitatively the experimental observations
highlighted above.

3 Conclusions
A novel
residence time MC model is proposed to account for the myriad interactions
encountered by a diffusing substrate in crowded physiological spaces
before it reaches the target enzyme active site. The enzyme reaction
dynamics was investigated using parameters such as enzymatic reaction
rate, product diffusivity, and relaxation time of substrate/product.
It is shown that enhanced nonspecific binding/trapping of the substrate
by the crowder dramatically diminishes the enzymatic reaction rate.
The kinetic trends observed in the model with increasing residence
time of the substrate were in qualitative agreement with experimental
enzyme kinetics data obtained in aqueous media using alkaline phosphatase
and crowding dextran macromolecules in a range of sizes. Such a result
implies that free diffusion of the substrate or reaction intermediates
in a metabolic pathway can severely compromise the final product yield
in the pathway. The role of clustered enzymes held together by weak
quinary interactions while channeling the reaction intermediates for
meeting urgent metabolic demands appears to be a natural way to safeguard
against free diffusion of the substrate. The results from the proposed
model thus provide crucial insights justifying the need for the presence
of the metabolon.

4 Experimental Section
Alkaline phosphatase (bovine intestinal mucosa) and dextrans (Leuconostoc mesenteriodes) of molecular weights 40,
500, and 2000 kDa were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Pvt.
Ltd., India. The polydispersities of the dextrans were typically less
than 2.0 as reported by the manufacturer. Glycine and Na2HPO4 of analytical grade were obtained from MERCK, whereas p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt was bought from Sisco
Research Laboratories, India. All other chemicals employed were of
analytical grade.

4.1 Hydrolysis of PNPP by Alkaline
Phosphatase
A typical reaction mixture contained alkaline
phosphatase (2 μM) and PNPP dissolved in an aqueous solution
of 100 mM glycine buffered at pH 9.5. The PNPP concentration was kept
at 1 mM, which is well above the measured Km under the reaction conditions employed (0.25 mM). The concentration
of dextran in the medium was varied between 0 and 30% (w/w). For larger
dextrans, such as 2000 kDa, kinetic measurements with higher concentrations
such as 25 or 30% w/w were not possible due to problems related to
solubility and mixing. The total weight of the reaction medium was
kept constant at 1.0 g. All samples were made in deionized water.
Crowding agents increase bulk viscosity of samples. Thus, the reaction
was initiated by forcefully mixing the enzyme (typically ∼50
μL in buffered aqueous medium) with an aqueous buffered mixture
containing the substrate and crowding agent (typically ∼950
μL) in an Eppendorf tube using a syringe. This mixture was vigorously
agitated in a vortex mixer for 30 s. Immediately after, the mixture
was transferred to a cuvette, and the progress of the reaction was
conveniently monitored by recording the absorbance of the product p-nitrophenol at 450 nm after a dead time of 30 s using
a double beam spectrophotometer (CARY 100, Varian, USA). All samples
were run in duplicates. All experiments were done at room temperature
(298 K).

4.2 Calculation of Rate of Reaction
The
initial velocity, V, was obtained from the slope
(linear regression) of the first 20 s of the recorded absorbance/time
data. The initial velocity observed under identical conditions, but
in the complete absence of the crowding species, was referred to as V0. This was normalized to a value of 100 for
ease in comparison of velocities obtained in presence of crowding.
The points depicted (Figure 2) are the averages of at least three independent experiments
done on different days. Blank solutions containing a mixture of the
crowding agent (25% w/w) employed and the corresponding substrate
showed negligible change in the absorbance in the complete absence
of the enzyme under identical conditions.
