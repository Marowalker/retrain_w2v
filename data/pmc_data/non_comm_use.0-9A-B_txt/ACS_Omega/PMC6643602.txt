The
potential of pyrene-1-sulfonate to act as an emitting anion
for the development of ionic liquids is explored here. Amphiphilic
trimethylpropylammonium hepta(isooctyl)octasilsesquioxane and conventional
imidazolium, namely, 1-vinyl-3-hexyl-, 1-vinyl-3-decyl-, and 1-methyl-3-decyl-imidazolium,
featuring moderate alkyl chain length substituents, have been chosen
as countercations. The new species have been synthesized via simple
metathesis reactions involving pyrene-1-sulfonate sodium salt and
the appropriate halide cation precursors. Their thermal behavior has
been investigated by thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry
at different scanning rates. According to this latter technique, only
the trimethylpropylammonium hepta(isooctyl)octasilsesquioxane pyrenesulfonate
adduct, displaying a reversible glass transition at −4.2 °C,
may be classified as an ionic liquid. All pyrene-1-sulfonate imidazolium-based
ion pairs are crystalline solids with the melting point just above
100 °C that produce very complex, nonreversible, and scanning
rate-dependent thermograms, very likely arising from polymorphism
phenomena. Such a behavior may be attributed to the pyrene-1-sulfonate
polycyclic system, which in solution, as confirmed through spectroscopic
characterization, displays a general attitude in promoting supramolecular
structures via cation interactions. Emission lifetime measurements
on the emitting fluorophore reveal that there are at least two different
active species, whereas light scattering measurements show the presence
of aggregates with hydrodynamic radii depending on the medium and
adduct concentration. Tests aimed at investigating the potential of
these novel pyrene-1-sulfonate salts in functionalization/exfoliation
of graphite flakes are also reported here.

1 Introduction
Ionic
liquids (ILs), defined as salts melting below 100 °C,
have attracted extensive attention in the last 2 decades because of
their custom-tailored physicochemical properties, such as low vapor
pressure, wide liquid range, excellent chemical, thermal, and electrochemical
stability, dispersant capabilities, dielectric constants, extraction
capabilities, and so on.1−3 As such, ILs are highly versatile
media replacing conventional organic solvents and electrolytes, finding
applications in many strategic fields such as catalysis, electrochemical
devices, separation processes, synthesis, nanochemistry, photonics,
and, more recently, biotechnology.4−10 Anchoring of IL units to proper substrates such as polymer networks
and/or nanomaterials is a successful synthetic methodology to access
IL-based materials, usually referred to as supported ILs (SILs), with
higher processing performance and even new functions.11−17 Among others, by promoting ionic self-assembly processes, ILs and
SILs have shown to be ideal precursors leading to advanced ionic supramolecular
assemblies.18−21

ILs with intrinsic functions, usually defined as task-specific
ILs, are easily obtained by introducing active ions in IL structures.22−24 Thanks to the high disposal of organic emitter ions, this approach
is a useful means to access novel soft photoluminescent materials,
alternative to rare-earth fluorophores, for application in photonics,
sensing, optoeletronic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells, and so
on.12,25−29 By using this strategy, ILs with improved physico-chemical
properties and processing capabilities, such as solubility, photostability,
high quantum yields, and so on, differing significantly from those
of the related salts, have been obtained.30−35 Further, systematic studies also showed that the photoactivity of
ILs constitutes, to some extent, a tunable, structurally controlled
IL function.36,37

Because of the high relevance
of the so-called “POSS nanotechnology”
(POSS = polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes) in the context of materials
science, we have devoted our attention to the development of POSS-based
ILs. Briefly, POSS are cage-like hybrid units with empirical formula
(SiO1.5)x consisting of an
inner inorganic core tethered with organic substituents widely used
as efficient nanofillers inducing improved thermal, mechanical, and
oxidation stability. Interestingly, when POSS is used as a scaffold
for covalent binding of photoluminescent moieties, it experiences,
among others, a dispersing action, which results in a significant
improvement of quantum efficiency.38−42 In the course of our studies on POSS tetraalkylammonium-based
ILs,38−40 we have reported on the synthesis and photochemical
characterization of 1:4 POSS@TPPS ILs based on meso-tetrakis-(4-sulfonatephenyl)porphyrin tetraanion (TPPS) and the
POSS monofunctionalized cation, trimethylpropylammonium hepta(isooctyl)octasilsesquioxane.41 The synthesis, based on a simple biphasic chloroform/water
process, as well as the resulting optical properties, is highly dependent
on the amphiphilic nature of the bulky cation. The latter acts as
a highly dispersant agent in chlorinated solvents, reducing the well-known
aggregation tendency of the TPPS tetra-anion, both in solution and
in the solid state. Therefore, long emission lifetimes were observed
for both the TPPS anions and TPPS J-aggregates. Analogous to porphyrins,
pyrene derivatives constitute a class of attractive and thoroughly
investigated solvatochromic fluorophores widely applied in optoelectronics,
biochemistry, and sensor fields. These compounds are characterized
by long excited-state lifetime and, in concentrated solution and in
the solid state, lead to characteristic excimers because of self-association
phenomena.42−53 Furthermore, pyrene acts as a probe for the local environment polarity
because the intensity ratio of the first to third vibronic emission
bands (I/III ratio) is very sensitive to the solvent polarity.48 On the basis of these considerations, pyrene
sulfonate anions were chosen for the development of novel photoluminescent
ILs.

In the present study, we report on the synthesis and characterization
of a series of ion pairs based on monofunctionalized pyrene-1-sulfonate
(PS). Because of their high versatility and applications, besides
trimethylpropylammonium hepta(isooctyl)octasilsesquioxane, conventional
imidazolium cations, featured by “moderately” long alkyl
chains, have been also considered as PS counterions (Scheme 1). Vinyl-imidazolium-based
ILs are commonly used and they find a plethora of applications in
various fields. It is well known that their properties can be opportunely
tuned by varying the alkyl chain length. In addition, we chose to
use vinyl-imidazolium derivatives to achieve potentially cross-linkable
systems, thus tuning the IL properties. Furthermore, it has been reported
that the presence of a vinyl substituent on the imidazolium ring provides
additional hydrogen bonding interactions between the cations and anions
whose strength decreases with increasing anion size.21 The new 1:1 ionic adducts were characterized by matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry,
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC), and a series of spectroscopic techniques (NMR, UV–vis,
steady-state, and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy). We anticipate
that while the POSS–pyrene adduct is classifiable as an IL,
the imidazolium ones, featuring melting points above 100 °C,
have to be considered as simple ion pairs.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation
and Abbreviations of PS Adducts
The combination of spectroscopic and light scattering
data support
the monomeric nature of the POSS–PS adducts in solution. On
the contrary, imidazolium derivatives display a general attitude to
self-organize in supramolecular structures through cation interactions,
with the polycyclic anion acting as a nucleation center.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
As
described in the Experimental Section, PS
POSS–ammonium and imidazolium derivatives (Scheme 1) were synthesized in high
yields according to simple metathesis reactions. All new adducts have
been obtained as pale yellow solids, except for POSS–PS, which
appears very sticky, consistent with the nature of the cation. The
characterization of the new ionic adducts was carried out by elemental
analyses, conventional spectroscopic techniques (UV–vis, static
and time-resolved fluorescence emission, and NMR spectroscopy), and
MALDI–TOF spectrometry. Karl Fischer titrations reveal no significant
level of water. Nevertheless, all samples were dried under vacuum
overnight at 50 °C.

The 1H NMR spectra of the
new ionic adducts display a signal pattern consistent with the presence
of an asymmetric pyrene group between δ 8–9.5 ppm, which
well integrates 1:1 with those of the cation counterpart. The presence
of the PS polycyclic anion does not produce other significant changes
with respect to those of the parent IL halides: the only exception
concerns the up-field shifts observed for the NC(H)N imidazolium protons
that, as it is well known, are very sensitive to the nature of the
anion. MALDI-TOF mass spectra of all new ion pairs (see Supporting Information) show the presence of
a single signal corresponding to the molecular mass peak of the ionic
species.

The thermal behavior of the new ionic PS adducts has
been investigated
by DSC and TGA analyses (Table 1). As reported in Table 1 and Figure 1, the occurrence of only a reversible glass transition at
−4.2 °C and no melting point under 100 °C (DSC data)
indicate that POSS–PS may be defined as an IL. Accordingly,
imidazolium–PS must be considered as simple ion pair couples.

With respect
to POSS–PS, imidazolium derivatives afford
more complex and diversified DSC responses. Figure 1 (upper) reports the heating course for all
imidazolium samples, collected at 10 °C min–1. The curve of 1-vinyl-3-hexylimidazolium (VEIm)–PS features
a broad and weak endothermic event at 22.2 °C, followed by two
distinct exothermic peaks at 42.7 and 79.9 °C, pointing to the
occurrence of amorphous-to-crystal and solid-to-solid transitions,
respectively, together with a broad endothermic event at 124.5 °C
(Tonset). Actually, the shape of this
last peak is not sharp, suggesting overlapped melting events. DSC
thermograms of VDIm–PS present two very narrow endothermic
events (120.9 and 135.7 °C), very likely associated with the
melting of two distinct crystalline species with different arrangements
or packing.

Finally, the DSC scan of 1-methyl-3-decylimidazolium
(MDIm)–PS,
bearing a methyl group in place of vinyl on the imidazolium ring,
features a weak exothermic process (Tonset = 113.7 °C), immediately followed by a melting event at 132
°C. The observed heating transition phase profiles are not reversible.
In the corresponding cooling curves (Figure 1, lower), only a liquid-to-solid process
is observed for all the samples.

This exothermic process is
well defined for both MDIm– and
VDIm–PS (Tm = 114.0 and 104.8 °C,
respectively), while for VEIm–PS, it shows unresolved multipeaks
with Tonset at 98 °C. As expected,
by lowering the DSC heating/cooling scan rate to 2 °C min–1 (see Supporting Information), different DSC thermograms have been obtained. In the heating scan,
the melting transition for MDIm–PS is featured by two narrow
peaks at 132.1 and 135.4 °C, very likely arising from two distinct
crystal-to-liquid phase transitions. The melting process for VDIm–PS
is detected as a broad signal with a Tonset of 133.43 °C and Tmax of 138.0
°C, which is preceded by a solid-to-crystal transition. By cooling,
an unresolved double exothermal peak is observed for MDIm–PS
at 114.0 °C, while for VDIm–PS, a crystallization peak
appears at 104.8 °C. Conversely, VEIm–PS affords a heating
curve displaying an endothermal peak at 125.7 °C and a cooling
one featuring a broad exo-multipeak with Tonset at 98.0 and Tmax at 88.5 °C. The
thermal behavior of imidazolium ILs/salts has been widely explored,
and the role played by the nature of cations and/or anions, alkyl
chain lengths on the aromatic ring, and intermolecular forces and
symmetry in determining glass, melting, and meso- and polymorphic-phase
transitions has been demonstrated.21,54−56 On the basis of our experimental findings, it is reasonable to suppose
that as solids, Imi–PS can be organized in supramolecular structures,
via the alkyl chain, which can undergo “order–disorder”
or vice versa phase transitions, thus affording nonreversible heating/cooling
cycles and different DSC scanning profiles at different heating rates.57 On the other hand, recent reports have described
the role played by pyrene moieties in promoting and controlling the
polymorphic superstructures of asymmetric dendritic biphenyl-based
supramolecules.57 Our DSC data suggest
that (i) the thermal transition phase behavior of POSS–PS is
still determined by the bulky amphiphilic nature of the trimethylpropylammonium
hepta(isooctyl) octasilsesquioxane cation39 and (ii) the substitution of bromide with a PS anion produces significant
modifications on imidazolium-ILs, in terms of the melting point increase
and the overall DSC thermogram profiles.14,21 Although the DSC technique is currently used for the determination
of thermodynamic parameters of ILs/salts, it is not able to give satisfactory
information on molecular and supramolecular polymorphic structures.
Further investigation of the thermal behavior for these imidazolium–PS
ionic adducts goes beyond the aim of the present study. The thermal
stability of the new adducts was determined by TG analyses (Figure 2, Table 1) in the temperature range between
50 and 800 °C, under a nitrogen flow (60 mL min–1) and heating rate of 10 °C min–1. The TGA
profile of POSS–PS proceeds, essentially, in a large temperature
range for which two temperatures of maximum volatilization (338.8
and 465.2 °C) are observed. The imidazolium–PS adducts
afford very similar thermograms, as the mass losses take place in
a single step. As their thermal stability is concerned, TGA data suggest
that the presence of the vinyl substituent on the imidazolium ring
induces a lower stability. Accordingly, VDIm–PS displays Tonset and Tmax values
significantly lower than those observed for MDIm–PS.

and POSS–PS.

2.2 Photophysical
Behavior in Solution
All the samples displayed a similar
behavior in terms of good solubility
in solvents with different polarities [tetrahydrofuran (THF), CHCl3, and MeOH] up to millimolar concentration, where they are
stable for months, as confirmed by the invariance of the UV–vis
and fluorescence emission spectra. The photophysical properties and
aggregation behavior of these adducts have been investigated in chloroform
and methanol solution by various spectroscopic and light scattering
techniques. Pyrene-1-sulfonate–tetra-n-butyl
ammonium salt (TBA–PS) has been used as a reference. The UV–vis
and fluorescence emission spectra in chloroform and methanol are similar
for all the investigated samples. As an example, Figure 3 reports the spectroscopic
features of MDIm–PS. Absorption bands with a characteristic
vibronic fine structure, between 300 and 350 nm (upper graph), together
with a structured emission band centered at ca. 378 nm (lower graph)
are typical of the pyrene chromophore. The observed ipsochromic shift
of the absorption bands in methanol with respect to chloroform (Δλ
= −3 nm), together with intensity ratio modulation of the first
to third vibronic emission bands, is ascribable to the change in solvent
polarity. Beer’s law is obeyed up to millimolar concentrations
and no additional nonstructured band at longer wavelengths, characteristic
of excimer emission, has been observed for all the species.58 To confirm the absence of the excimer in solution,
emission spectra at different sample concentrations and excitation
spectra at different emission wavelengths have been collected (see Supporting Information). In any case, no evidence
for the presence of excimers has been obtained. The fluorescence emission
decays, in aerated solutions, show a biexponential profile with comparable
long-lifetime values from 4.6 to 4.8 ns and a short one from 1.4 for
MDIm to 2.1 ns ca. for POSS. As an example, Figure 4 shows a typical decay trace, while lifetimes
and relative amplitude values are shown in Table 2.

The two emission lifetime values
are consistently shorter than
those reported for PS sodium salt (PS–Na) in aqueous solution
but very similar to those obtained for TBA–PS in apolar solvent.
This experimental evidence underlines that the presence of oxygen
could be responsible for this discrepancy. The biexponential decay
curves observed for these PS adducts are clearly indicative of two
different species in solution.

The fluorescence anisotropy decay
[r(t)], which allows us to gain
information on the formation of supramolecular
structures via the rotational diffusion of the fluorophores, gives
a rotational correlation time of about 1 ns, which is not fully compatible
with the size of the single molecule (see data in Table 2). Further, the rotational correlation
time suggests that the free rotation of each single fluorophore is
partially inhibited.

In order to investigate the aggregation
behavior in solution, dynamic
light scattering (DLS) experiments were performed at different concentrations
of PS–imidazolium derivatives in chloroform and methanol solutions.
DLS data collected in Table 3 are in line with the presence in solution of a monodisperse
population of spheric aggregates with hydrodynamic radii RH depending on the solvent polarity and adduct concentration.
In chloroform, only some aggregate structures are detectable at low
concentrations (1 μM), while larger ones are well identifiable
at highest concentrations (100 μM). In the more polar methanol,
nanometer-sized aggregates are already detectable at very low concentrations
(1 μM). This behavior could be ascribed to assembling phenomena
involving imidazolium cations. Comparative DLS experiments, performed
on MDIm, VDIm, and VEIm bromide precursors, indicate that these compounds
have no tendency to self-aggregate, independent of the alkyl chain
length on the imidazolium ring. The absence of resonant light scattering
peaks in the PS absorption region (see Supporting Information) allows us to exclude the presence of extended
PS aggregates resulting from the strong electronic coupling of adjacent
chromophores. However, it does not exclude the formation of dimer
or small oligomers, which could be responsible for the observed spectroscopic
behavior. Hence, on the basis of these DLS and photophysical investigations,
we can speculate on the formation of supramolecular species obtained
by the interaction between PS anion as monomers, dimers, or small
oligomers embedded in nanostructured aggregates, mainly because of
countercation supramolecular self-assembly with a consequent consistent
reduction of the fluorophore mobility. We can conclude that extended
stacking is not observed, presumably owing to the great “edge”
effect due to the alkyl chains of countercations.

2.3 Interaction
of PS Adducts with Graphite Flakes
Polycyclic aromatic compounds,
based on pyrene, perylene, and so
forth, in a simple ionic or amphiphilic properly functionalized form
constitute useful species for a supramolecular approach in graphite
(GR) exfoliation to graphene as well as for noncovalent modification
of graphitic surfaces.59−61 Among others, various substituted pyrene salts have
been successfully employed in shear-assisted exfoliation of natural
GR as well as of GR flakes (GFs).62,63 On the other
hand, thanks to their ionic nature and their tunable surface tension,
ILs are an ideal “solvent” for GR exfoliation and stabilization
of graphene suspensions.64−66

Stable GFs/PS-adduct THF
suspensions have been obtained by using a sonication-assisted liquid
phase procedure as described in the Experimental
Section. These suspensions have been analyzed by UV–vis
and Raman spectroscopy, the latter being one of the most powerful
tools to investigate graphitic surfaces and edge modifications. All
the GFs@PS-adduct composites afford comparable electronic and Raman
spectra; hence, the discussion will be limited to the GFs@VDIM–PS
sample.

According to Figure 5a, the Raman spectrum of GFs is consistent with a graphitic
system
bearing no significant structural defects, featuring a disordered,
related low-intensity D peak at 1352 cm–1, a sharp
G band at 1578 cm–1, ascribed to E2g vibrational mode, and the 2D one centered at around
2718 cm–1 and characterized by two subbands, namely,
2D2 and 2D1.67

Figure 5 Raman spectra
of (a) GFs and (b) GFs@VDIm–PS. (*) Peaks
assigned to the PS moiety.

In the GFs/VDIM–PS Raman spectrum (Figure 5b), the GF pre-existing bands
show a different
intensity ratio, while new ones appear. In particular, the D band
intensity increases, the G band is slightly split at a higher wavenumber,
and the contribution D′ is now detectable at 1621 cm–1. At the same time, the 2D pattern is broader and shifted to lower
energy with the 2D1 component (at around 2690 cm–1) more pronounced.68 The intense band
in the range 900–1050 cm–1 is attributable
to the PS moiety.69

The UV–vis
absorption spectra of VDIm–PS and GFs@VDIM–PS
in THF solution are reported in Figure 6. By comparison, the modification induced by the presence
of GFs on the VDIm–PS pattern is clearly evident. Even the
fluorescence emission properties are modified (Table 3). The emission decay of GFs@VDIM–PS
shows a biexponential profile with lifetimes of 3.7 and 1.6 ns and
with relative amplitudes of 86 and 14%, respectively. The longest
lifetime is shorter with respect to that of the VDIm–PS precursor
(4.6 ns), while the relative amplitude is largely increased.

spectra of VDIm–PS in THF (solid line) and GFs@VDIm–PS
(dashed line) in THF.

Even if the supramolecular interactions between the PS anion
and
GFs occur, they are not sufficient to afford an efficient exfoliation
to graphene. For the sake of comparison, we have also explored the
capabilities of halide IL precursors in GF processing. As an example,
imidazolium bromide in THF solutions produces significant exfoliation
of GFs, [see Raman and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
analyses in Supporting Information]. This
finding suggests that the PS polycyclic system is responsible for
noncovalent functionalization of the GF surface and that the nature
of cations does not play any synergic role in the GR exfoliation process.

3 Conclusions
As part of our general interest
regarding the design and synthesis
of functional and SILs, here, we have reported on the PS anion attitude
in generating fluorescent ILs. Amphiphilic trimethylpropylammoniumhepta(isooctyl)-octasilsesquioxane
and conventional imidazolium have been chosen as countercations. The
experimental evidence shows that among the series of synthesized PS
ion pairs, only the POSS derivative exhibits an IL behavior. Different
from IL halide precursors, all imidazolium–PS derivatives display
a crystalline nature. The PS anion, which does not undergo self-assembly
processes, seems to play a main role in promoting the formation of
imidazolium polymorphic structures, which are responsible for their
complex transition phases. DLS investigations confirm the presence
in solution of nanometer-sized species whose dimension is dependent
on the solvent polarity and sample concentration; meanwhile, spectroscopic
data indicate the absence of the extended electronically coupled chromophores
in these supramolecular aggregates. These findings suggest, once more,
that the presence of bulky surfactant cations is demanding in the
design of luminescent-based PS ILs and more in general of ILs involving
highly delocalized anions. Finally, we have also explored the capabilities
of the new compounds in GF processing. On the basis of Raman data,
we suggest that simple supramolecular interactions are operating between
the PS anion and GF surface. These noncovalent forces are responsible
for the stabilization observed in THF dispersion.

4.2.5 Exfoliation/Functionalization of GFs
In a general procedure,
GFs (15 mg) and PS-based ionic adducts (30
mg) were grinded together in a mortar and then transferred into a
vessel containing 15 mL of THF. The resulting mixture was sonicated
for 24 h at room temperature then left to stand for 12 h, and finally
centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 30 min to precipitate excess GF powder.
The obtained light gray supernatant suspension has been used for analysis.
By following a similar procedure, a specimen based on GFs and VDIm–Br
was prepared for comparison.

4.3 Instruments
1H and 29Si{1H} NMR solution spectra
were obtained in deuterated
solvents at room temperature on a Bruker AMX R-300 spectrometer operating
at 300.13 and 59.62 MHz for 1H and 29Si nuclei,
respectively. Chemical shifts (δ, ppm) were referred to SiMe4. TGA were performed by means of PerkinElmer Pyris TGA7 in
the temperature range between 50 and 800 °C, under a nitrogen
flow (60 mL min–1) and heating rate of 10 °C
min–1. DSC measurements were carried out by using
a TA Q20 instrument equipped with a refrigerant cooling system with
a heating rate of 2 and 10 °C min–1, in the
−80 to +140 °C temperature range and under an anhydrous
N2 atmosphere (60 mL min–1). MALDI-TOF
mass spectra were acquired using Voyager DE (PerSeptive Biosystems)
using an acquisition protocol reported elsewhere.70−72trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]-malonitrile
(DCTB) was used as the matrix. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer calibration
and average molecular mass determination were performed as reported
in previous cases.73,74 Because of the isotopic composition,
molecular species are detected in the mass spectra as clusters of
peaks; to simplify their assignments, m/z values reported in the text are referred to the first peak of each
cluster, corresponding to the ion containing the most abundant isotope
of each element present. Micro-Raman spectra have been excited by
the 532 nm diode laser wavelength, analyzed by a monochromator equipped
with a 1800 line/mm grating, and collected by a Peltier-cooled charge-coupled
device (CCD) sensor. STEM observations were carried out with a Zeiss-Gemini
2 electron microscope, operating at an accelerating voltage of 150
kV and equipped with a MultiScan CCD camera. STEM samples are prepared
by depositing one drop of the solution on a 400 μm meshe carbon
support sputter-coated with chromium and left to dry at room temperature
for 3 h. UV–vis spectra were obtained using a Hewlett-Packard
mod. 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Static and time-resolved
fluorescence emission measurements were performed on a Jobin Yvon-Spex
FluoroMax 4 spectrofluorimeter using the time-correlated single-photon
counting technique. A NanoLED (λ = 390 nm) has been used as
the excitation source. Emission spectra were not corrected for the
absorbance of the samples. Resonance light scattering (RLS) experiments
were performed on a Jasco mod. FP-750 spectrofluorimeter, adopting
a synchronous scan protocol with a right angle geometry.75 RLS spectra were not corrected for the inner-filter
effect of the samples. Hydrodynamic particle sizes and size distributions
were measured by DLS and carried out at 25 °C by a Zetasizer
Nano-ZS (Malvern Instruments) equipped with a 633 nm He–Ne
laser using backscattering detection. Each DLS sample was measured
several times, and the results were averaged. IL stock solutions,
obtained by dissolving the adducts in CHCl3 and/or MeOH,
were stored in the dark and used within a week from preparation. The
range of concentration (1 × 10–6 to 5 ×
10–4 M) used in our experiments was determined spectrophotometrically
by using the molar extinction coefficient at the Soret maximum.
