Air-stable thin films
(50–720 nm thickness) composed of
a carbon-centered neutral π-radical with high and anisotropic
electrical conductivities were fabricated by vapor deposition of 4,8,12-trioxotriangulene
(TOT). The thin films were air-stable over 15 months
and were the aggregate of TOT microcrystals, in which
a one-dimensional π-stacking column was formed through the strong
singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO)–SOMO interaction with
two-electron-multicenter bond among the spin-delocalized π-planes.
The orientations of the one-dimensional column of TOT were changed depending on the deposition rate and substrates, where
face-on-oriented thin films were epitaxially grown on the graphite
0001 surface, and edge-on-oriented thin films were grown on glass,
SiO2, and indium tin oxide substrates under a high-deposition
rate condition. The films showed high electrical conductivities of
2.5 × 10–2 and 5.9 × 10–5 S cm–1 along and perpendicular to the π-stacking
column, respectively, for an edge-on oriented thin film.

Introduction
There have recently
been intense challenges on the application
of organic neutral radicals in various fields such as spin memories,1,2 electrical conductors,3,4 and thermal sensors5 because a molecule having an unpaired electron
works under a unique operating principle based on electronic spin.6−8 There are several successful reports on thin-film fabrications,
one of the most essential and general methods for the application
to electronic devices, based on open-shell molecules such as nitroxide
radicals,9−13 cyclopentadienyl radical,14 donor–acceptor
type triphenylmethyl radicals,15 metal
radical complexes,16 Blatter-type radicals,12,17 singlet biradicaloids,18,19 dithiadiazolyl radicals,20 and bis(dithiadiazolyl) diradicals.21,22 Neutral π-radicals, where the unpaired electron is included
in a π-conjugated system, are a good candidate for thin-film
fabrication because the delocalization of electronic spin increases
thermodynamic stability.23 For example,
vapor-deposited thin films of bis(dithiadiazolyl) diradical showed
photoconductivity,22 and vapor-deposited
thin films of phenalenyl-based singlet-biradicaloid exhibited ambipolar
field-effect transistor (FET) properties.18 Both radicals achieved one-dimensional (1D) structures by strong
intermolecular spin–spin interactions, and their thin films
showed electron-transport abilities through the 1D structures. In
general, organic semiconductors are anisotropic, and electron transport
parallel to the substrate is advantageous for FET, while that vertical
to the substrate is advantageous for photovoltaics and light-emitting
diodes.24 The control of the molecular
orientation within the thin film is, therefore, one of the most important
subjects for the high-performance devices based on neutral π-radicals.

Although electrical conductivity is one of the representative transport
properties, there are a few reports on thin-film electrical conductor
based on neutral radicals. The bis(dithiadiazolyl) diradical, of which
single crystal conductivity was very low (10–8 S
cm–1) due to the strong π-dimerization within
the π-stacking column,25 gave a thin
film with a room-temperature conductivity of 10–9 S cm–1.22 It should
be noted that the charge doping of the bis(dithiadiazolyl) diradical
using iodine increases their conductivity in 10 orders in the crystalline
state.26 Recent reports on a nitroxide
radical polymer thin film by the spin-coat and thermal annealing method
exhibited a room-temperature conductivity of 0.28 S cm–1.27 However as far as we know, the neutral
radical thin film showing high and anisotropic electrical conductivity
has not been reported.

We recently succeeded in the synthesis
and isolation of 4,8,12-trioxotriangulene
(TOT, 1) and its derivatives23,28−34 as a new class of polycyclic carbon-centered organic neutral π-radicals
with high air stability (Figure 1a).35TOT neutral
radicals are treatable under an ambient condition in both solid and
solution states even without steric protection groups, and no decomposition
was found until 350 °C.23 The origin
of this high stability is spin delocalization over the 25π electronic
system and electronic spin modulation by three oxygen atoms. TOT derivatives generally form face-to-face 1D π-stacking
columns, namely, “π-stacked radical polymer”,
in the solid state due to the strong intermolecular interaction of
singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO).35 The orientation control of the 1D column in thin films is highly
attractive because the 1D column plays an essential role for their
electronic properties such as strong magnetic interaction,23 high electrical conductivity (e.g., 2,6,10-tribromo-TOT 2: 1.8 × 10–3 S cm–1 in the crystalline state at room temperature)30 and near-infrared photoabsorption.29 Although neutral radical crystals with further higher electrical
conductivities such as some zwitterionic bis(phenalenyl) boron complexes
(0.3 S cm–1, at most)36,37 and bis(dithiazolyl)
radicals (4 × 10–2 S cm–1, at most)38,39 have been reported, the electrical
conductivities of TOT crystals are extremely high as
a single component purely organic neutral radical. The pristine TOT 1 forms a π-dimer with a staggered overlapping through
strong SOMO–SOMO interaction via the two-electron-multicenter
bonds (pancake bonding),40 and the π-dimers
further stacks to construct a 1D column along the c-axis (Figure 1b).23 In this report, we show the air-stable thin-film
fabrication (50–720 nm thickness) of 1 by the
conventional vacuum vapor deposition method as the first example of
thin films of a condensed polycyclic carbon-centered neutral π-radical
with high and anisotropic electrical conductivities (10–2 to 10–5 S cm–1). The molecular
orientations (edge-on/face-on, Figure 1c) and morphologies of the thin films are changed by
the deposition conditions, and we discuss the relationship between
molecular orientations and electronic properties of the thin films.

Results
and Discussion
Morphologies and Orientations in Thin Films
on SiO2
Thin films of 1 were fabricated
by the conventional
vacuum vapor deposition method, and the conditions and properties
of the films are summarized in Table S1 (50–720 nm thickness). The sublimation occurred over 150
°C at 0.2–6 mPa, and no residual and ash were left in
the crucible. This result implies that 1 was stable in
this sublimation condition and shows a good agreement with our previous
experiments, where the bulk 1 neutral radical did not
show any obvious decomposition even at 350 °C under air or N2 conditions.23 The obtained thin
films were highly air-stable, and no obvious decomposition was observed
under air over 15 months and also annealing at 150 °C for 5 h
in air (Figure S1). Morphologies of the
thin films on SiO2 were observed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (Figure 2a–c).
At a slow deposition rate (v = 0.2 Å s–1), two kinds of microcrystals, block- and wire-like shapes, were
found (Figure 2a).
When the deposition rate increased, the wire-like microcrystals gradually
decreased, and the block-like microcrystal grains obviously became
small (Figure 2b, v = 1.2 Å s–1). At v = 5.8 Å s–1, a uniform dense film consisting
only of the block-like microcrystals was obtained (Figures 2c and S2). The drastic change of morphologies was also investigated
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses.

thin films of 1. Thin films on SiO2 at the
low deposition rate (v = 0.2 Å s–1) (a,e), at the middle deposition rate (v = 1.2

ITO at the high deposition rate (v = 6.3 Å s–1) (d,g), and (h) 1 powder. (i) Absorption
spectra of thin films of 1 on the glass substrate. The
thin films were set perpendicular to the optical axis.

The thin film fabricated at a low rate of v =
0.2 Å s–1 showed a set of peaks (marked peaks,
2θ = 27.5° and 30.9°) nearby the main peaks (Figure 2e) that were found
for the powder sample (Figure 2h). The marked additional peaks would be afforded by the wire-like
microcrystals because they were observed only in thin films of a low
deposition rate (Figure 2a). The in-plane XRD pattern of the thin film on SiO2 at
a high deposition rate (v = 5.8 Å s–1) showed a strong peak at 2θ = 27.0° (Figure 2f), which corresponds to the
interlayer distance along the c-axis (d(102̅) = 3.26 Å, Figures S3 and S4). The out-of-plane XRD pattern, on the other hand, showed peaks
at 2θ = 9.8, 16.8, 19.6, and 25.8°, which correspond to
the periodic structures [d(21̅0) = 9.2, d(300) = 5.3, d(42̅0) = 4.2, and d(51̅0) = 3.5 Å, respectively] perpendicular
to the π-stacking columns. These XRD spectra suggest that the
microcrystals of 1 are aligned with the c-axis parallel to the SiO2 substrate and thus that the
thin film has an edge-on orientation (Figure 1c). It has been reported that a π-molecule
tends to stand perpendicular to a substrate giving an edge-on film,
when the interaction between the π-molecule and the substrate is considerably weak in comparison
with the interaction between π-molecules.27 The strong SOMO–SOMO interaction between 1 molecules forming the π-stacking column would prevent the
interaction between the π-electronic system of 1 and SiO2, and thus the edge-on orientation was constructed
on the SiO2 substrate. In addition, the acid/base interaction
of carbonyl and/or C–H on the TOT skeleton with
a highly polar surface of SiO2 substrates may promote the
formation of edge-on thin films. The diffraction peaks observed in
the thin film at a high deposition rate (v = 5.8
Å s–1) were in good agreement with those of
the single crystal (Figure S4). This indicates
that the molecular arrangement in the thin film is identical to the
crystalline state, and that the thin film is expected to exhibit a
similar conductivity to that of the bulk sample.23

A thin film of 1 deposited on a glass
substrate was
reddish brown which is similar to the color of the powder sample (Figure S5). Absorption spectra with a perpendicular
incidence for the thin films showed a broad and strong near-infrared
peak around 1050 nm (Figure 2i). This result also suggests the edge-on orientation because
this absorption band is characteristic for the 1D column of 1 and is anisotropically observed only in the direction perpendicular
to the optical axis.29 The absorption maxima
showed a slight shift depending on the deposition rate. The spectrum
of the high deposition rate (v = 5.8 Å s–1) film is similar to that of the pristine powder (λmax = 1038 and 1030 nm,23 respectively).
On the other hand, the peak top was shifted to 1096 nm at a low deposition
rate (v = 0.2 Å s–1). The
lower energy shift might be derived from minute differences in the
π-stacking structure in the 1D column as shown in the wire-like
microcrystals in the low-deposition rate film (Figure 2a).23,29 These observations
indicate that 1 formed an edge-on-oriented film (Figure 1c) on the SiO2 substrate under the high deposition rate (v = 5.8 Å s–1), where the molecules at the
interface layer contact with the substrate at the molecular edge and
the π-stacking columns were parallel to the SiO2 or
glass substrates. It is expected that the electrical conductivity
parallel to the substrate is much higher than that perpendicular to
the substrate.

Electrical Conductivities of Thin Films
It is well
known that the morphology and arrangement of an organic molecule in
vapor-deposited thin films are highly sensitive to the substrates.27,41 The vapor deposition of 1 on indium tin oxide (ITO)
at a high deposition rate (v = 6.3 Å s–1) formed a thin film with a different morphology from that on the
SiO2 substrate, where the film consisted of a larger size
of microcrystals (Figure 2d). The in-plane XRD pattern showed a strong peak at 2θ
= 27.0° similar to the films on the SiO2 substrate,
and there was no peak in the out-of-plane measurement (Figure 2g), indicating that 1 formed another edge-on thin film on the ITO substrate. In an edge-on-oriented
film, the 1D columns of 1 are parallel to the substrate
(Figure 1c), the electron
mobility parallel to the substrates would be advantageous than that
perpendicular to the substrate.39 The electrical
conductivity of the thin film of 1 on the glass substrate
at the high deposition rate (v = 6.3 Å s–1) was measured by the two-probe method (Figure 3a,b). The electrical conductivity
parallel to the substrate was found to be 2.5 × 10–2 S cm–1 at the room temperature (Figure 3c). This very high electrical
conductivity is similar to that of the single crystal of 0.32 S cm–1 at room temperature measured by the four-probe method
as expected (Figure 3c). The slight decrease in the electrical conductivity in the thin
film is caused by the randomness of the orientation of the 1D columns
within the parallel direction to the substrate, and a higher conductivity
is expected if the orientation of the 1D columns is aligned in this
direction. The electrical conductivity of the thin-film became smaller
with decreasing temperature because of the small semiconducting activation
energy (82 meV), which is also comparable to that of the single crystal
(90 meV). The similarity of the conducting properties of the thin
film and single crystal implies that the effect of impurity during
vapor deposition is negligible. It should be also noted that the thin-film
electrical conductivity of 1 (2 × 10–5 S cm–1) is much higher than the thin films prepared
from of single-component organic molecules such as bis(dithiadiazolyl)
diradical (10–9 S cm–1)22 and 2,5-bis-methylthio-7,7′,8,8′-tetracyanoquinodimethane
(2 × 10–5 S cm–1),42 and also comparable to the single-crystal conductivities
of zwitterionic bis(phenalenyl) boron complexes (0.3 S cm–1)36,37 and bis(dithiazolyl) radicals (4 ×
10–2 S cm–1).38,39 The high electrical conductivity of the thin film of 1 originates not only from the highly oriented π-stacking columns
as the conducting pathway but also from the suppression of grain boundary
resistance in the uniform dense thin film. On the other hand, the
electrical conductivity vertical to the thin film, which is perpendicular
to the π-stacked column (Figure 3b), was measured as 5.9 × 10–5 S cm–1. Although the anisotropy of electrical
conductivities of these two films cannot be directly compared because
the substrates were not the same, the electron mobility along the
π-stacking column is significantly higher than that perpendicular
to the column.

Thin Film on Graphite
Heteroepitaxy is often used to
obtain highly ordered thin films.43 Graphite
has rich π-electrons on the 0001 surface of a hexagonal crystal
system (a = b = 2.46 Å, γ
= 120°) and is often used as the substrate for epitaxially face-on
oriented ultrathin and/or monolayer films of polycyclic aromatic carbons.41,44,45 The crystal system of 1 is trigonal (a = b = 18.2 Å,
γ = 120°),23 and the c-axis epitaxial growth with a face-on orientation is expected
because of the acceptable misfit ({d(100)substrate
– d(800)TOT}/d(100)substrate = 7.5%) in organic heteroepitaxial systems.45 Furthermore, it has been reported that weak
intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds parallel to the
π-molecular plane promote the face-on orientation in thin films.46,47 In the crystal structure of 1, a 2D network is constructed
by C–H···O hydrogen bonds parallel to the molecular
plane (ab-plane)23 and
is expected to stabilize the face-on orientation. The vapor-deposited
thin film of 1 on the graphite 0001 surface of highly
oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) (Figure 4a) and graphite sheets (Figures 4b–d) showed drastically
different morphologies compared with those on the SiO2 and
glass substrates. The cross-section SEM images of the thin film clearly
showed that columnar microcrystals of 1 densely stood
on the substrates to form sheer cliff-like morphologies (Figure 4c,d). The out-of-plane
XRD pattern of the thin film on a well-peeled graphite sheet showed
only a peak at 2θ = 27.0° that corresponds to the interlayer
distance (d(102̅) = 3.26 Å) in the c-axis together with the peaks of graphite substrates (Figure 4e, top). On the other
hand, the in-plane XRD pattern showed peaks that correspond to the
periodic structures perpendicular to the 1D columns in the ab-plane, and the (102̅) peak at 2θ = 27.0°
was not found (Figure 4e, bottom). These observations clearly indicate that the thin films
on graphite substrates have an almost completely face-on orientation
on the graphite 0001 surfaces. The drastic molecular orientation change
between the films on SiO2 and graphite was also seen in
the change of the color of each film. A vapor-deposited thin film
on the single-layer graphene-SiO2 substrate was reddish
brown, while that on the SiO2 substrate was greenish brown
(Figure 4f). This is
because the 1D column perpendicular to the optical axis selectively
absorbs red to near-infrared light (edge-on film, 700–1300
nm, Figure 4g). The
anisotropy of the electrical conductivity of the face-on film is expected
to be exactly opposite to that of the edge-on film, and it is expected
that the conductivity is higher in the vertical direction. However,
because of the contact resistance between the thin film and the electrode
as well as the difficulty in the deposition of a metal electrode on
the thin film, we could not perform the accurate measurement of the
electrical conductivity. The face-on orientation was kept up to the
film thickness of 700 nm at least in the SEM observation regardless
of the deposition rate (v = 0.1–3 Å s–1, Table S1), showing that
the SOMO–SOMO interaction in the 1D π-stacking column
was strong enough to set more than 1500 molecules.

Conclusions
In conclusion, by utilizing
the high stability of the TOT neutral radical, we successfully
fabricated air-stable thin films
of 1 by the conventional vapor-deposition method as the
first thin film of the neutral π-radical having a fused polycyclic
structure with high and anisotropic electrical conductivities (10–2 to 10–5 S cm–1). A large number of stable neutral radicals have been reported,
however, those stable even in the vaporized state under high temperature
and vacuum (0.2–6 mPa) conditions to give a vapor-deposited
thin film are limited.9−12,15,17−22 In the TOT thin films, 1D π-stacking columns
were formed by the strong SOMO–SOMO interaction. The anisotropic
orientation of the 1D columns depended on the substrates: edge-on-oriented
thin films were obtained on glass, SiO2, and ITO under
a high deposition rate, and face-on oriented thin films were achieved
on the graphite 0001 surface. The electrical conductivity of the edge-on
oriented thin films showed high anisotropy: the electrical conductivity
parallel to the substrate was considerably higher than that vertical
to the substrate (10–2 vs 10–5 S cm–1). It is worth noting that the neutral radical
thin films showing anisotropic and high electrical conductivity have
not been known before the TOT thin film of the present
study. The present result suggests the potential for the TOT neutral radical as a molecular building block of organic electronic
materials and may provide a new milestone in the material exploration
in the development of organic electronic devices. Moreover, the 1D
structure of π-radical aggregation and the resultant anisotropic
electrical conductivity would be applied to novel applications based
on radicals for such as Haddon’s hypothesis,3 spintronics devices, and organic thin-film rechargeable
lithium-ion batteries without conductive additives in the electrode.
More superior electrically conductive thin films would be obtained
by using mixed-valence compounds prepared by carrier doping of the
neutral π-radical.26,30

Experimental Section
Materials
Neutral radical 1 was prepared
as we had reported.23 All of the substrates
were commercially available materials. The nonalkali glass and ITO/glass
substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min in Shibata
clean A (Shibata Scientific Tech. Ltd.), pure water, and 2-propanol.
The substrates dried in an oven were then exposed to a UV-ozone atmosphere
for 30 min. HOPG was freshly cleaved with the Scotch tape. Graphite
sheet (GRAPHINITY, KANEKA Corp.) was used without pretreatment (SEM
measurement) or peeled 24 times with the Scotch tape (SEM and XRD
measurement). Single-layer graphene–SiO2 (Graphene
Platform Corp.) was used as purchased.

Vapor Deposition
The thin films of 1 were
fabricated on the substrates by vacuum evaporation under a pressure
of 0.2–6 mPa, using vapor evaporation chambers, ULVAC VPC-260
or Kenix KXV-250. The substrates were horizontally fixed above the
evaporation source in a crucible (d = 30 or 90 mm),
and the crucible was gradually heated from room temperature to 220–270
°C, and the sublimation occurred over 150 °C. Almost all
substrate 1 mounted in the crucible evaporated under
the deposition conditions. The deposition was monitored by the measurement
of the thickness by a quartz crystal resonator in the chamber. The
thickness of the resulting film was measured using the cross-section
SEM image or stylus profilometry (Veeco Dektak 150) because of the
poor sensitivity of the quartz crystal resonator especially in the
case of d = 30 mm. The averaged deposition rate was
obtained by dividing the film thickness by the deposition time. The
deposition conditions and thickness are summarized in Table S1. The Au/1/ITO and Au/1/glass cells were fabricated by the following method: Au
electrodes were evaporated through shadow masks in a vacuum with a
pressure of ca. 2 mPa onto the thin films of 1 deposited
on an ITO electrode or a glass substrate. The cells were annealed
at 150 °C for 5 h before electrical measurement.

Measurements
Electronic spectra of KBr pellets or thin
films on glass substrates were measured on a UV/visible/NIR scanning
spectrophotometer (HITACHI U-4000). Morphology of the thin films was
observed on a high-resolution SEM (Hitachi High-Technologies FE-SEM
SU6600). The XRD measurements were performed by a diffractometer (Rigaku
SmartLab). The temperature-dependent electrical conductivities of
the edge-on film parallel and perpendicular to the substrate were
measured using the direct current (dc) two-probe method. As for the
measurement parallel to the substrate, the two-probe method using
comb-shaped electrodes was performed because of very high resistance.
The gold comb-shaped electrodes were formed by vacuum evaporation
of gold on the film of 1 with a gap of 0.25 mm (top contact, Figure 3a). In the case of
the measurement perpendicular to the substrate, the thinness of the
film prevented a measurement with the four-probe method, and we measured
in the two-probe method, where the films of 1 were formed
on the ITO electrode, and then, gold was evaporated on the film of 1. The cells were attached onto the thermal stage (As-One
HI-1000), and electrical measurement data parallel and perpendicular
to the substrate were obtained using a picoammeter/voltage source
(Keithley 6487) and dc voltage current source (ADCMT 6243), respectively.
dc electrical conductivity of the single crystal of 1 along the π-stacking direction was measured by using a Keithley
2001 multimeter combined with the standard four-probe technique. Four
gold wires of 10 μm diameter were attached to a single crystal
of 1 with carbon paint (Jeol Dotite Paint XC-12) using
gold wires of 10 μm diameter using carbon paste.
