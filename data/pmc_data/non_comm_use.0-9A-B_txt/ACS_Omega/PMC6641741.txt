Variable-temperature
NMR spectroscopy has recently emerged as a
new alternative to the magnetometry methods for studying single molecule
magnets. Its use is based on an accurate determination of magnetic
susceptibility tensor anisotropy Δχ, which is not always
achievable due to some contact contribution to NMR chemical shifts
and possible conformational dynamics. Here, we applied this approach
to cholesteryl-substituted cage cobalt(II) complexes featuring a very
large magnetic anisotropy. Conformational rigidity and large size
of the cholesteryl substituent with many magnetically nonequivalent
nuclei resulted in an excellent convergence of experimental and calculated 1H and 13C chemical shifts, thus allowing for the
determination of Δχ value for all of the synthesized cobalt(II)
complexes with a very high accuracy and providing a more reliable
zero-field splitting energy for further calculations.

Introduction
In the last decade,
molecular magnetism and single molecule magnets
(SMMs), which are organometallic and coordination compounds showing
superparamagnetism in certain circumstances,1−8 have become a hot topic in both research and application of magnetic
materials, such as in quantum information-processing devices9 and quantum computers.10 The key property of an SMM is a slow magnetic relaxation11 that results from a magnetization reversal barrier
between the states with MS = +S and −S.
The method of choice for studying an SMM behavior is usually ac-magnetometry
that directly measures the magnetic relaxation time. The higher is
the reversal barrier U to magnetization, the longer
is the time of its relaxation (if the Orbach “over-the-barrier”
relaxation mechanism prevails). For SMMs based on the first-row d-ions, the reversal barrier U is proportional
to the zero-field splitting energy D.6 The latter can also be obtained by other physical methods,
such as dc-magnetometry,12 electron paramagnetic
resonance spectroscopy,13 calorimetry,14,15 far-infrared spectroscopy,16−19 or magnetic circular dichroism.20−22 They, however,
not always provide the value of D with accuracy that
is high enough for interpreting ac-magnetometry data; some of them
even fail to correctly determine its sign.

NMR spectroscopy,
which is routinely used for studying magnetic
properties, has rarely been applied to SMMs.23−28 One of the recently developed approaches for estimating the zero-field
splitting energy by using NMR spectroscopy is based on the analysis
of variable-temperature NMR spectra.29,30 For it to
successfully recover the D value (with an accuracy
superior to many above methods), the magnetic susceptibility tensor
anisotropy Δχax should be accurately determined
through the values of a pseudocontact (dipolar) shift in an NMR spectrum;
those directly depend on the coordinates of the nuclei in a studied
compound. As molecules in a solution undergo fast (in the NMR timescale)
dynamic conformational changes (such as the rotation around single
C–C bonds, etc.), all their possible conformations should be
taken into account in such an analysis, making the extraction of Δχax from NMR spectra a real challenge.31,32 The other source of errors is a Fermi (contact) contribution to
the total NMR chemical shift, which arises from spin polarization
conveyed through molecular orbitals; it becomes negligible at a distance
of 5–6 covalent bonds. A rough estimate of the contact shifts
can be obtained from quantum chemical calculations based on the density
functional theory (DFT) methods.33

Results
and Discussion
To overcome both these obstacles that preclude
an accurate determination
of Δχax value by the proposed approach, the
studied compound should have many magnetically nonequivalent nuclei
located within a conformationally rigid fragment and at over 5–6
chemical bonds from the paramagnetic center. Although most of the
SMMs reported to date are coordination compounds,11 a number of organometallic compounds were reported to demonstrate
an SMM behavior as well.34−36 As they keep their conformation
in a solution and do not undergo chemical exchange in the NMR timescale,
they seem to be a much better choice for the determination of Δχax by this NMR-based approach than most of the coordination
compounds.27,28 To confirm the benefits of having
at least one conformationally rigid and large chemical fragment for
this purpose, here we applied the proposed approach to new cholesteryl-substituted
cobalt(II) complexes 1 and 2 with pyridine-
and pyrazole-oximate ligands (Scheme 1; see Supporting Information (SI) for more details); SMM behavior of similar complexes, so-called
clathrochelates,37 with an unusual trigonal
prism (TP) coordination geometry has recently been reported.29−31 Their iron(II) or zinc(II) analogs 1Fe and 2Zn, respectively, were obtained as diamagnetic species needed for estimating
diamagnetic contributions to chemical shifts; free ligands can sometimes
be used as well.

Scheme 1 NMR spectra of both the cobalt(II) complexes 1 and 2 at room temperature feature signals with
chemical shifts
up to few hundreds ppm (Figures S1–S14 and Tables S1–S4 in SI), and each nucleus of the cholesteryl
fragment has its own value of the chemical shift (Figures 1 and S10 in SI). Even though the cholesteryl fragment is mostly rigid, not
all of its nuclei are suitable for an accurate determination of Δχax. Among them are proton nuclei 18–19, 21–27
and carbon nuclei 21–27 (Scheme 1) owing to a free rotation around the C–C bonds;
others are proton nuclei 1–7 and carbon nuclei 1–9,
19 (Scheme 1), which
have a significant contact contribution to their chemical shifts.

Figure 1 Fragment
of 1H NMR spectrum for complex 1 in CD2Cl2 (20 °C, 14.1 T, numbering is
the same as shown on Scheme 1). The full spectrum as well as the spectra for complex 2 are given in SI (Figures S1, S9, and S10).

Apart from these exceptions
(additionally warranting the need to
have many magnetically nonequivalent nuclei in the studied compound),
all of the others were good to be used for estimating the value of
Δχax for complexes 1 and 2. Within the proposed NMR-based approach, the chemical shift
δ of these nuclei in the NMR spectra of the cobalt(II) complexes
is expressed as follows  The diamagnetic contribution δdia is the corresponding
chemical shift in the NMR spectra of the isostructural
diamagnetic analogs (iron(II) 1Fe or zinc(II) 2Zn complex); r and θ are the polar coordinates
as they result from quantum chemical calculations of the cobalt(II)
complexes after geometry optimization (see SI for details). The chemical shifts predicted by this approach (by
varying the value of Δχax) are then fitted
to those measured experimentally. The extremely good convergence (Figures 2, S15, and S16 in SI), which was observed with the magnetic
susceptibility tensor anisotropy taken as 2.2404 ± 0.0003 ×
10–31 m3 for 1 and 2.536
± 0.003 × 10–31 m3 for 2, shows that a highly accurate estimate was obtained for
these cobalt(II) complexes from their NMR spectra.

Figure 2 Correlation plots of
experimental vs calculated 1H (top)
and 13C (bottom) chemical shifts for complex 1; an average absolute error |δexp – δcalc| being 0.028 ppm. Those for complex 2 are
given in SI (Figures S15 and S16).

Note that the obtained values
of Δχax are
among the largest at room temperature for cobalt(II) compounds;31 the larger magnetic anisotropy of complex 2 apparently owes to its coordination geometry that is closer
to a trigonal prism.30

Indeed, according
to X-ray diffraction analyses of the two cobalt(II)
complexes (Figure 3), the CoN6 polyhedron adopts a slightly different geometry
(Table S5 in SI). It is nearly an ideal
trigonal prism (TP, for which the distortion angle φ is 0°)
in 2 but is distorted toward a trigonal antiprism (for
which φ is 60°) in 1; the corresponding φ
values are 0.0(2)–1.2(2) and 13.0(3)–14.4(3)°,
respectively. The reason for this difference is that both the cobalt(II)
complexes are the so-called pseudoclathrochelates:38 only one of their capping fragments is a cross-linking
boron atom, whereas the second one is an anion (Figure 3). The perchlorate anion in 1 is loosely bound to the pyridine moieties by weak C–H···OCl
contacts (O···H distance from 2.4 Å), but the
chloride anion in 2 forms strong hydrogen bonds with
the NH functionalities of the pyrazole fragments (N···Cl
3.083(5)–3.137(5) Å, NHCl 156(1)–173(1)°),
thus resulting in a more TP-like geometry. This stresses the importance
of slight modifications to the coordination environment of the metal
ion for the magnetic anisotropy of a paramagnetic compound and its
SMM properties.31

Figure 3 General views of the
cobalt(II) complexes 1 (left)
and 2 (right) according to X-ray diffraction. Hydrogen
atoms (except for those of the NH functionalities in 2), second independent moiety in 1, and solvate CHCl3 molecules in 2 are omitted for clarity.

For those nuclei in the cobalt(II)
complexes 1 and 2 that have conformational
dynamics or a significant contact
contribution to their chemical shifts in the NMR spectra, the approach
gives less accurate predictions of the Δχax value (Figures 4, S17, and Tables S1–S4), as explained above.

Figure 4 Correlation
plots of experimental vs calculated 1H (top)
and 13C (bottom) chemical shifts for complex 1; those for complex 2 are given in SI (Table S3). The black squares denote the “good”
nuclei; the red dots, nuclei with a significant contact contribution
to their chemical shifts; the blue triangles, nuclei that have some
conformational dynamics; the cyan triangles, nuclei of the ligand
that are very close to the cobalt(II) ion.

To take the contact contribution δc into
the account  we estimated it as follows, by performing
a DFT calculation of g-tensor and hyperfine interaction
constant A(33)  Although the
convergence between the resulting
chemical shifts and those measured experimentally for complexes 1 and 2 is worse than when the corresponding
nuclei were omitted from the fitting procedure (Figure 2), it is still pretty good. However, for
the nuclei affected by the conformational dynamics, the chemical shifts
predicted by this approach deviate significantly from the experimental
values (Figure S17).

Conclusions
As
a result, by using a convenient NMR-based approach, the magnetic
susceptibility tensor anisotropy Δχax in a
paramagnetic compound can be estimated with a very high accuracy,
which is a prerequisite for an accurate estimation of zero-field splitting
energy. It was, however, made possible by choosing cholesteryl-substituted
tris-pyridinoximate and tris-pyrazoloximate cobalt(II) complexes,
as they are conformationally rigid and chemically stable in solution;
the latter being even more typical of organometallic compounds. Having
a very high magnetic susceptibility tensor anisotropy, which is a
prerequisite for the SMM behavior, these cobalt(II) complexes can
also be used as paramagnetic tags for structure determination of biological
macromolecules39,40 (such as cholesterol-binding
proteins41) or as model compounds for chiral
discrimination by NMR spectroscopy.42
