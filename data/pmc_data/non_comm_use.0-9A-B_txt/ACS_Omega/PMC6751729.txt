The
pervaporation of binary alcohol/water mixtures across polymeric
membranes is modeled by combining the Maxwell–Stefan (M-S)
diffusion formulation with the Flory–Huggins (F-H) description
of sorption equilibrium. The combined M-S/F-H model shows that the
flux of each penetrant species is coupled to the driving force of
its partner penetrant. Two types of coupling contributions can be
distinguished: (i) coupling arising out of correlated motions of penetrants
in the polymer matrix and (ii) thermodynamic coupling. The focus of
this article is on the contribution of thermodynamic coupling, which
is quantified by the set of coefficients , where ai, the activity of species i, is dependent
on the volume fractions ϕi,ϕj, of both penetrants in the polymeric membrane.
Detailed analyses of published experimental data for pervaporation
of ethanol/water feed mixtures of varying compositions in both hydrophobic
(poly(dimethylsiloxane)) and hydrophilic (cellulose acetate, polyimide,
and polyvinyl alcohol/polyacrylonitrile composite) membranes show
that in all cases, the cross-coefficients Γij (i ≠ j) are negative
and may attain large magnitudes in relation to the diagonal elements
Γii. The net result is that the
permeation fluxes of each penetrant are suppressed by its partner,
resulting in mutual slowing down of permeation fluxes. If thermodynamic
coupling effects are ignored, significantly higher fluxes are anticipated
than those that are experimentally observed.

Introduction
Separations of alcohol/water
mixtures by pervaporation across polymeric
membranes are of industrial interest because of the high separation
selectivities that are achievable.1−9 Alcohol-selective separations are achievable with hydrophobic membranes
such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS).3−5,10 With hydrophilic membranes (e.g., cellulose acetate (CA), polyimide,
and poly(vinylalcohol)/polyacrylonitrile (PVA/PAN) composites), the
separations are selective to water.9,11−13 Water-selective separations are also achieved by exploiting size
exclusion in hydrophobic perfluorinated polymer membranes.14,15 For process development and design purposes, robust and accurate
models are necessary for calculation of the permeation fluxes.

Chemical potential gradients, dμi/dz, are the fundamentally correct driving forces
for transport of penetrants across polymeric membranes.6,16−18 The chemical potentials of the penetrants in the
polymer matrix are most conveniently described by the Flory–Huggins
(F-H) model that relates the component activities ai to the volume fractions, ϕi.8,19−21 For ternary mixtures of two penetrants (1, 2), and the polymer matrix
(m), there are three interaction parameters in the
F-H description of phase equilibrium: χ12, χ1m, and χ2m. The F-H model for the component activities of the penetrants is
written as follows2,8,19,21 1  In eq 1, V̅i are
the partial molar volumes, and we define   

In the Maxwell–Stefan
(M-S) diffusion formulation, which
is firmly rooted in the theory of irreversible thermodynamics, the
volumetric permeation fluxes, NiV, expressed in m3 m–2 s–1, are related to the chemical
potential gradients as16−18 2  Detailed derivations of eq 2 are provided in the Supporting Information. Essentially, in the M-S
model, the chemical potential driving force acting on a penetrant
species (left member) is balanced by (i) friction with partner penetrant
(first right member = 1–2 friction) and (ii) friction between
the penetrant and the polymer matrix (second right member).18 The molar flux of component i, expressed in mol m–2 s–1, is .
The mass flux of component i, expressed as kg m–2 s–1, is Nimass = ρiLNiV = MiNimolar, where ρiL is the liquid-phase mass density
of the pure component i, with molar mass Mi.

The M-S diffusivities
for penetrant–membrane interactions, ĐimV, are often strongly influenced by the volume
fractions of penetrants due to swelling1,3,6,16 3  In eq 3, ε11,
ε12, ε21, ε22 are
termed plasticization coefficients.
More detailed discussions on the interpretation of the magnitude,
and signs, of εij are available
in the literature.2,3,22,23

The M-S diffusivities Đ12V and  quantify
the extent to which the mobilities
of the penetrants are correlated to each other; correlation
effects have the effect of slowing down the transport of the more
mobile partners due to correlation motions with tardier partners in
the polymer matrix.17,18

Let us define a 2 ×
2 dimensional matrix [Λ] whose elements
are given by 4  The ratios  and  quantify the degrees of correlations; only one of these is independent because . We may estimate Đ12V using the
Vignes interpolation formula24 for diffusion
in binary liquid mixtures, adapted as follows17 5  with the limiting scenarios 6  Alternatively,
the degree of correlations  may be fitted to match experimental data
on mixture permeation.18

In the limiting
scenario in which correlation effects are considered
to be of negligible importance, i.e., , the matrix [Λ] simplifies to yield 7  Strictly speaking, we should
expect eq 7 to hold when
the volume
fractions of both penetrants in the membrane are negligibly small.

The parameters on the left-hand side of eq 2 may be expressed in terms of gradients in
the volume fractions by introducing a 2 × 2 dimensional matrix
of thermodynamic correction factors [Γ] 8  The four elements Γij can be determined by the analytic differentiation of eq 1.

Combining eqs 2, 4, and 8, we derive an explicit
expression for the volumetric fluxes as functions of the gradients
in the volume fractions 9  Under steady-state conditions, and assuming
that the volume fraction profiles for both penetrants across the membrane
layer are linear, the permeation fluxes across a membrane of thickness
δ may be calculated explicitly as follows17,18 10  In eq 10, Δϕi = ϕi0 – ϕiδ; i = 1,2, where ϕi0 and ϕiδ are, respectively, the volume fractions at the upstream (subscript
0) and downstream (subscript δ) faces of the membrane; the volume
fractions are in equilibrium with the bulk fluid mixtures in the contiguous
compartments, determined from solution of the F-H equations as detailed
in the Supporting Information. In the linearized
approach, the elements of each of the two matrices [Λ], and
[Γ] are evaluated at the arithmetic averaged volume fractions . The accuracy of the linearized eq 10 has been established
in an earlier work.18

Except in the
scenario in which the volume fractions of both penetrants
are vanishingly small, i.e., ϕi →
0, each of the two square matrices [Λ] and [Γ] on the
right-hand side of eq 10 will have significant off-diagonal elements; consequently, the flux
of a penetrant is coupled to the driving force of
its partner species. From eq 10, it is evident that there are two distinct and separate contributions
to coupled transports: (i) correlation effects, embodied in the off-diagonal
elements of [Λ] and (ii) thermodynamic coupling engendered by
the off-diagonal elements of [Γ]. The significance of correlation
effects has been highlighted in earlier published works.3,13,16−18 The main focus
of this article is on the significance of thermodynamic coupling effects
in alcohol/water pervaporation.

As an illustration, Figure 1a presents calculations
of Γij for the ternary mixture ethanol(1)/water(2)/PDMS(m) at 313 K for varying mass fractions of ethanol in the
liquid feed
mixture in the upstream compartment of the membrane, ω1L. Both the off-diagonal
elements are negative; particularly noteworthy are the large negative
values of Γ12. The effective driving forces for membrane
transport of penetrants ethanol, and water are, respectively, Γ11Δϕ1 + Γ12Δϕ2 and Γ21Δϕ1 + Γ22Δϕ2. The large negative value of Γ12 implies that the flux of ethanol, N1V, is strongly influenced,
i.e., suppressed, by the driving force for water transport, Δϕ2 = (ϕ20 – ϕ2δ). Although the off-diagonal element Γ21 has a small
negative value, the flux of water, N2V, is also significantly
influenced by the driving force for ethanol because Δϕ1 ≫ Δϕ2 for hydrophobic PDMS.
As an illustration of the strong influence of thermodynamic coupling, Figure 1b plots the ratio
of driving forces (Γ11Δϕ1 +
Γ12Δϕ2)/(Γ21Δϕ1 + Γ22Δϕ2) as a function of ω1L. Also plotted in Figure 1b is the corresponding ratio if thermodynamic
coupling effects are ignored, Δϕ1/Δϕ2. Neglect of thermodynamic coupling should be expected to
have the effect of severely overestimating the ethanol/water permeation
selectivity.

at the averaged volume fractions ϕi,av = (ϕi0 + ϕiδ)/2, taking ϕiδ ≈ 0. The F-H parameters and calculation details are provided
in Table S2 of the Supporting Information.

This article has threefold objectives. First, we
aim to demonstrate
that thermodynamic coupling effects are the root cause of mutual slowing-down
effects that have been observed in the published experimental studies
of Hietaharju et al.,3 and Nasiri and Aroujalian4 for ethanol/water pervaporation across PDMS membrane.
The second objective is to show that the off-diagonal elements Γ12 and Γ21 also engender mutual slowing-down
effects in hydrophilic (CA,6,7 polyimide,13 and PVA/PAN composite11) membranes. The third objective is to offer deeper physicochemical
insights into membrane permeation fluxes and selectivities by delineating
the separate influences of diffusion and thermodynamic coupling for
each of the case studies that are analyzed.

To meet the set
objectives of this article, we analyze ethanol/water
pervaporation across four different polymeric membranes: PDMS, CA,
polyimide, and PVA/PAN composite. The Supporting Information accompanying this publication provides: (i) the
F-H model parameters used in the phase equilibrium calculations and
(ii) input data on the M-S diffusivities.

Results and Discussion
Analysis
of Ethanol/Water/PDMS Permeation Data of Nasiri
Nasiri and
Aroujalian4 report experimental
data for pervaporation of ethanol(1)/water(2) mixtures across PDMS
membrane, measured at three different temperatures: T = 313, 323, and 333 K. In eqs 19 and 20 of Nasiri and Aroujalian,4 used to model their own experiments, the M-S
diffusivities are modified in the following manner to explicitly account
for cluster formation leading to mutual slowing-down effects observed
in their experiments: 11  The set of plasticization, and clustering,
coefficients, along with the zero-occupancy diffusivities are fitted
for each of the three experiment sets; see Table 2 of their paper.
Below, we adopt a different approach for modeling their three sets
of experiments, using the linearized eq 10, invoking the Vignes interpolation formula 5, along with eq 3 to describe the penetrant–membrane
interactions. From sorption equilibrium, it is noted that the volume
fractions of water, ϕ2, in the membrane are about
1–2 orders of magnitude lower than that of ethanol, ϕ1; therefore, the plasticization coefficients ε12, ε22 are taken as zero. We use the same set of
plasticization coefficients for all three sets of experiments: ε11 = 5; ε12 = 0; ε21 = 12;
ε22 = 0. The fitted values of zero-occupancy M-S
diffusivities are specified in Table S4 of the Supporting Information.

Two different scenarios A and
B are used to model the Nasiri and Aroujalian experiments. The continuous
solid lines in Figure 2a,b are obtained using scenario A, using eq 10, along with proper evaluation of Γij using the F-H eqs 1; there is good agreement with experimental data (indicated by the
symbols). The dashed lines in Figure 2a,b are model calculations using scenario B, also using eq 10, but ignoring thermodynamic
coupling contributions by invoking the assumption Γij = δij, the Kronecker
delta. The use of scenario B leads to overestimation of both ethanol
and water fluxes. This leads us to conclude that the mutual slowing-down
effects are engendered by thermodynamic coupling effects.

Figure 2 (a, b) Experimental
data (indicated by symbols) of Nasiri and Aroujalian4 for the mass pervaporation mass fluxes of penetrants
ethanol (1) and water (2) across PDMS (m) at 313
K (red circles), 323 K (blue triangles), and 333 K (green squares),
plotted as a function of the mass fraction of ethanol in the liquid
feed mixture in the upstream compartment ω1L. The continuous solid lines are
M-S model calculations (scenario A) using eqs 3, 5, and 10. The dashed lines are flux calculations in which thermodynamic
correction factors are ignored (scenario B), i.e., Γij = δij. The input
F-H and diffusivity data are provided in Tables S2 and S4 of the Supporting Information.

Further insights into the influence of negative cross-coefficients
Γ12 and Γ21 are obtained by comparing
the ratio of the mass fluxes of ethanol to water (see Figure 3). Ignoring thermodynamic coupling
(scenario B) overestimates the ethanol/water flux ratios at all three
temperatures. The influence of negative values of Γ12 and Γ21 is to suppress the flux of ethanol to a
greater extent than that of water, leading to lower ethanol/water
separation selectivity.

water for ethanol/water
pervaporation across PDMS at (a) 313 K, (b) 323 K, and (c) 333 K,
plotted as a function of the mass fraction of ethanol in the liquid
feed mixture in the upstream compartment ω1L. Model calculations using three
different scenarios A (continuous solid lines), B (dashed lines),
and C (dotted lines) are compared to the experimental data (symbols)
of Nasiri and Aroujalian.4 The input diffusivity
data are provided in the Supporting Information.

To elucidate the contribution
of the correlation effects, and also
the plasticization coefficients, εij, we performed model calculations for scenario C in which (a) correlation
effects are ignored, using eq 7, and (b) the influence of swelling is also ignored by setting
εij = 0. In scenario C, the ratio
of fluxes is described by 12  Equation 12 is essentially the thermodynamically corrected
driving
flux ratio (cf. Figure 1b), multiplied by a constant factor. The dotted lines in Figure 3 represent model
calculations of the ethanol/water mass flux ratios using eq 12. The agreement of scenario
C with experiment is comparable to that of scenario A, which includes
the effects of both correlations and plasticization. Two separate
conclusions can be drawn. First, correlation effects are of negligible
importance for ethanol/water/PDMS permeation. Second, swelling effects
do not influence permeation selectivities in the three sets of Nasiri
experiments in which the ethanol mass fraction in the upstream membrane
compartment was restricted to ω1L < 0.7. Rather, swelling effects serve primarily
to influence the magnitudes of the individual diffusivities ĐimV and fluxes NiV.

Analysis of
Ethanol/Water/PDMS Permeation Data of Hietaharju
Hietaharju
et al.3 report experimental
data on the mass fluxes of the penetrants, Nimass, for pervaporation of ethanol/water mixtures with varying mass fractions
of ethanol, ω1L, in the bulk liquid mixture in the upstream compartment at
temperatures T = 313 and 333 K. They3 also report experimental data for vapor permeation in which
the ethanol/water vapor mixture, in equilibrium with an ethanol/water
liquid-phase mixture at the corresponding dew point, is permeated
across the membrane. The experimental data for the mass fluxes of
ethanol and water are indicated by symbols in Figure 4a,b. The flux relations used by Hietaharju
et al.3 to model their own experiments
do not account for thermodynamic coupling effects (see eqs 28 and
29 of their paper). Consequently, the match of their model predictions
with experiments is extremely poor, especially for ethanol (see Figure
7 of their paper). We demonstrate that the poor match between experimental
data and model is wholly ascribable to thermodynamic coupling effects.

Figure 4 (a, b)
Experimental data (indicated by symbols) of Hietaharju et
al.3 for the pervaporation mass fluxes
of penetrants ethanol (1) and water (2) across PDMS (m) at 313 K (red circles) and 333 K (green squares), and vapor permeation
(blue triangles), plotted as a function of the mass fraction of ethanol
in the liquid feed mixture in the upstream compartment ω1L. The continuous
solid lines are M-S model calculations (scenario A) using eqs 3, 5, and 10. The dashed lines are flux calculations
in which thermodynamic correction factors are ignored (scenario B),
i.e., Γij = δij. The input F-H and diffusivity data are provided
in Tables S2 and S3 of the Supporting Information.

The continuous solid lines in Figure 4a,b are model calculations
using scenario
A, as detailed in the foregoing section; the agreement is very good
for all three data sets. We also confirmed that neglecting correlation
effects and using eq 7 to calculate [Λ] lead to nearly identical values of permeation
fluxes; this leads us to conclude that the coupling effects arise
solely from thermodynamic influences and not from correlated motions
of penetrants in the polymer matrix.

The dashed lines in Figure 4a,b represent model
calculations for scenario B in which thermodynamic
coupling effects are ignored; both the fluxes of ethanol and water
are higher than the estimations using scenario A. The explanation
for the decrease in both fluxes is traceable to the negative off-diagonal
elements Γ12 and Γ21, as shown in Figure 1a.

Figure 5 plots the
ratio of the mass fluxes of ethanol to water as a function of ω1L for the set of
experiments at 313 K. The influence of negative values of Γ12 and Γ21 is to suppress the flux of ethanol
to a greater extent, leading to lower ethanol/water separation selectivity;
consequently, the flux ratios calculated using scenario A (continuous
solid lines) are significantly lower than those calculated using scenario
B (dashed lines). Ignoring thermodynamic coupling (scenario B) overestimates
the ethanol/water flux ratios at all three temperatures.

Figure 5 Ratios of the
mass fluxes of ethanol to water for ethanol/water
pervaporation across PDMS at 313 K plotted as a function of the mass
fraction of ethanol in the liquid feed mixture in the upstream compartment
ω1L. Model
calculations using three different scenarios A (continuous solid lines),
B (dashed lines), and C (dotted lines) are compared to experimental
data (symbols) of Hietaharju et al.3 The
input diffusivity data are provided in Tables S2 and S3 of the Supporting Information.

To gauge the importance of the influence of plasticization, the
dotted lines in Figure 5 present calculations for scenario C, wherein eq 12 is used to determine the flux ratios. The
estimations of scenario C are slightly poorer than those for scenario
A, especially for the ethanol mass fractions in the upstream membrane
compartment ω1L > 0.5. This suggests that plasticization influences the
penetrant
diffusivities to different extents; this influence manifests at higher
penetrant occupancies in the membrane matrix.

Water/Ethanol Pervaporation
across Hydrophilic Membranes
Figure 6a,b presents
calculations of the ratios Γ12/Γ11 and Γ21/Γ22 for sorption equilibrium
between bulk water(1)/ethanol(2) liquid mixtures and three different
hydrophilic membranes: CA, polyimide, and PVA/PAN. For all three membranes,
the two ratios are negative and we should anticipate that thermodynamic
coupling would engender mutual slowing-down effects. For hydrophilic
membranes, correlation effects should also be expected to be of significance
because the more mobile penetrant, water, also has the higher permeation
flux. These two anticipated results are tested below using three case
studies.

Figure 6 Flory–Huggins calculations of (a) Γ12/Γ11 and (b) Γ21/Γ22 for the
sorption equilibrium of water (1) and ethanol (2) in CA (at 293.15
K), polyimide (at 293.15 K), and the PVA/PAN composite (at 333 K),
plotted as a function of the mass fraction of ethanol in the liquid
feed mixture in the upstream compartment ω2L. The F-H parameters and calculation
details are provided in the Supporting Information.

We first performed pervaporation
flux calculations for water(1)/ethanol(2)/CA
(m) using the F-H and M-S diffusivity data provided
by Mulder et al.,6,7 who established that swelling
effects are important and the experimental data could be adequately
described by choosing ε11 = ε12 =
ε21 = ε22 = 7.3.

The continuous
solid lines in Figure 7a are flux calculations
using scenario A. The negative off-diagonal elements Γ12 and Γ21 cause both water and ethanol fluxes to
be reduced below the values anticipated by scenario B, i.e., by invoking
the simplification Γij = δij.

Figure 7 (a) Molar fluxes of water (1) and ethanol (2)
across CA membrane
as a function of the mass fraction of ethanol in the liquid feed mixture
in the upstream compartment, ω2L. The continuous solid lines are M-S model
calculations (scenario A) using eqs 3, 5, and 10. The dashed lines are flux calculations in which thermodynamic correction
factors are ignored (scenario B), i.e., Γij = Γij. (b) Influence of
varying degrees of correlation on the water/ethanol flux ratios. The
Flory–Huggins and diffusivity data are provided in Table S5 of the Supporting Information.

To gauge the importance of correlation effects, Figure 7b compares the water/ethanol
flux ratios for three additional scenarios to estimate the degree
of correlations, , besides the Vignes interpolation formula 5: , , and . The assertion  essentially
implies the use of eq 7 for flux calculations.
With increasing degrees of correlation, the water/ethanol flux ratio
decreases, due to increasing retardation of the mobile penetrant water.
The dashed line in Figure 7b represents water/ethanol flux ratios ignoring thermodynamic
coupling; this shows that the influence of the negative off-diagonal
elements Γ12 and Γ21 is to reduce
the flux of ethanol more than the flux of water. The reasoning for
this is that the magnitude of Γ21/Γ22 is larger than that of Γ12/Γ11. Consequently, we should expect thermodynamic coupling effects influence
the ethanol flux to a greater extent than the water flux.

Figure 8a,b compares
experimental data11 on the molar fluxes
for pervaporation of water/ethanol mixtures across PVA/PAN composite
membrane at 333 K, with calculations (indicated by the continuous
solid lines) based on scenario A, in which the degree of correlations
is quantified as , along with
the choice ε11 = ε12 = ε21 = ε22 = 5. If thermodynamic coupling effects
are ignored and Γij = δij (scenario B calculations shown by the dashed
lines), the match with
experiments is significantly worse, and both water and ethanol fluxes
are overestimated to a significant extent.

In Figure 8c, the experimentally determined water/ethanol
fluxes ratios are compared to M-S model flux calculations using three
different degrees of correlations: , , and . The flux
ratios reduce by more than 1
order of magnitude with increasing degree of correlations.

by symbols) are compared to the model calculations using scenarios
A and B. (c) Comparison of experimentally determined water/ethanol

Figure 9a,b compares
the experimental data13 on volumetric fluxes
for pervaporation of water/ethanol mixtures across a polyimide membrane
with model calculations based on scenarios A and B. There is good
agreement between the experimental data and scenario A in which the
degree of correlations is described by , along with ε11 = ε12 = ε21 = ε22 = 2. Use of
scenario B, invoking Γij = δij, leads to overestimation of both fluxes.
To gauge the significance of correlations, Figure 9c compares the experimentally determined
water/ethanol fluxes ratios with model calculations using scenario
A to that of scenario C (using eq 12). Ignoring correlations has the effect of overestimating
the water/ethanol selectivities by about an order of magnitude.

mixtures across polyimide membrane, plotted as a function of the mass

by symbols) are compared to the model calculations using scenarios
A and B. (c) Comparison of experimentally determined water/ethanol
volumetric flux ratios (shown by the symbols) with the model calculations
using scenarios A (continuous solid lines) and C (dotted lines). The
Flory–Huggins and diffusivity data are provided in Table S6 of the Supporting Information.

For all three cases studies on hydrophilic membranes
analyzed above,
the influence of swelling serves to enhance the diffusivities of either
penetrant, but does not influence water/ethanol selectivities. On
the other hand, the influence of thermodynamic coupling effects is
to lower both water and ethanol fluxes, reducing the flux of ethanol
more than the flux of water. In other words, the influence of swelling does not completely
nullify the influence of thermodynamic coupling.

General Applicability
of the M-S Model for Describing Membrane
Permeation
In addition to the five different case studies
discussed above, the applicability of the Maxwell–Stefan model eq 2 has been established for
a number of other membrane permeation experimental studies.

For ethanol/water permeation across PDMS membrane, Aguilar-Valencia
et al.10 use the M-S formulation to rationalize
coupling between ethanol and water fluxes observed in their experiments.
Experimental data on ethanol/water pervaporation across silicone rubber
membranes are amenable to quantitative modeling with the M-S formulation.25,26 Ebneyamini et al.5 use the M-S formulation
to model their experiments for dehydration of aqueous butanol solutions
using hydrophobic membranes. However, thermodynamic coupling effects
are not of significant importance because the experiments were conducted
with dilute aqueous solutions for which both Γ12 ≈
0 and Γ21 ≈ 0. Izák et al.27,28 establish the applicability of the M-S formulation for a near-quantitative
description of the pervaporation of 1-alcohol/toluene mixtures across
low-density polyethylene membranes.

Mutual slowing-down effects
are not restricted to pervaporation
processes; they also manifest for permeation of gaseous CO2/C2H6 across a cross-linked polyethylene oxide
(XLPEO) membrane.16−18 The M-S model eq 2, with proper accounting of both thermodynamic coupling
and correlation effects, is required for quantitative modeling of
the experimental data; see Figures S14–S17 of the Supporting Information for details of analysis. Genduso et
al.29 use an analogous approach to model
coupling effects in CO2/CH4 permeation across
the XLPEO membrane.

The M-S formulation is used to describe
coupling effects during
water/alcohol permeation across both hydrophilic and hydrophobic zeolite
membranes,30 for which experimental studies31−33 demonstrate the occurrence of mutual slowing-down effects.

Conclusions
Published experimental data for alcohol/water pervaporation across
both hydrophobic (PDMS) and hydrophilic (CA, polyimide, PVA/PAN) membranes
are modeled by combining the Flory–Huggins description of sorption
equilibrium with the Maxwell–Stefan diffusion formulation.
For steady-state permeation, this combination results in eq 10, in which the matrices
[Λ] and [Γ] reflect, respectively, the diffusivity and
thermodynamic contributions. In general, each of these matrices contains
off-diagonal contributions; as a result, the fluxes of alcohol and
water are coupled to each other. The following major conclusions emerge
from our analysis.(1) For alcohol/water pervaporation across
hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes, the off-diagonal elements Γ12 and Γ21 are both negative in all of the
cases examined. Consequently, the effective driving forces for penetrant
transport are strongly influenced.

(2) For both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
membranes, the influence of thermodynamic coupling is to suppress
the flux of both penetrants, leading to mutual slowing down. For hydrophobic
membranes, the flux of ethanol is reduced to a greater extent, resulting
in lower ethanol/water selectivity. On the other hand, for hydrophilic
membranes, the water/ethanol selectivity is enhanced by the contribution
of the negative off-diagonal elements Γ12 and Γ21.

(3) For hydrophobic
PDMS membranes, correlation
effects appear to be of negligible importance because more mobile
water is practically excluded from the polymer matrix. In sharp contrast,
for hydrophilic membranes, correlation effects serve to reduce water/ethanol
selectivities to a significant extent due to retardation of water
transport.

(4) While membrane
swelling has the effect
of influencing the magnitudes of the penetrant diffusivities, the
corresponding influence on pervaporation selectivities is of minor
importance for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes.

(5) The distinction between
swelling effects
and thermodynamic coupling effects can be summarized as follows: swelling
influences diffusivities, whereas the off-diagonal elements of the
matrix of thermodynamic correction factors influence the driving forces
for transport of penetrants.
