Single- and double-component nanoparticles
consisting of two types
of diarylethenes, 1,2-bis(3-methyl-5-phenyl-2-thienyl)perfluorocyclopentene
(1a) and 1,2-bis(2-methyl-5-phenyl-3-thienyl)perfluorocyclopentene
(2a), were fabricated by a reprecipitation method. Nanoparticles
consisting of 1a exhibited orange or green fluorescence
depending on the fabrication condition and did not undergo any photocyclization
reaction. On the other hand, nanoparticles consisting of 2a underwent photoreversible photochromic reactions upon alternating
irradiation with ultraviolet and visible light. Nanoparticles consisting
of 1a and 2a exhibited fluorescence on/off
switching with rapid switching speed and high on/off contrast, accompanying
the photochromic reactions of 2a. The dependence of fluorescence
on/off switching properties on Förster distance and molar fraction
was observed and quantitatively evaluated by a simplified model.

Introduction
Photoresponsive materials
have been widely studied in various fields
because the properties of these materials can be modulated with noncontact
upon photoirradiation.1−3 Diarylethenes, which are one of the photochromic
compounds, undergo thermally irreversible and fatigue-resistant photochromic
reactions between the open-ring form and the closed-ring form upon
alternating irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) and visible light.4 Diarylethene derivatives linked to fluorophore
exhibit reversible fluorescence on/off switching accompanying the
photochromic reactions.4 When diarylethene
is in the open-ring form, the fluorophore exhibits fluorescence. On
the other hand, when diarylethene is converted to the closed-ring
form, the fluorescence is quenched because of an energy transfer from
the excited-state fluorophore to the diarylethene closed-ring form.5,6 In the case of dyad systems consisting of a diarylethene derivative
and a fluorophore, a low on/off contrast is often observed in a solution
because the system remains still at a few of diarylethene open-ring
forms at the photostationary state (PSS). In addition, high photocyclization
conversion upon UV irradiation is required to quench the fluorescence
completely because the fluorescence intensity decreases in proportion
with the photocyclization conversion of diarylethene.7−10 The fluorescence switchable diarylethene systems having the efficient
fluorescence on/off switching properties, such as high fluorescence
on/off contrast and rapid switching speed, are desirable for applications
in sensing materials,11−13 bioimaging materials for superresolution microscopy,14−17 and single-molecule memory materials.18−23

Recently, Fukaminato, Métivier, and co-workers achieved
extremely rapid and high fluorescence on/off contrast with full reversibility
and high fatigue resistance using nanoparticles consisting of a diarylethene
linked to a benzothiadiazole derivative.24 In the nanoparticles, a large number of the excited-state fluorophores
are quenched by a single diarylethene closed-ring form because
of the close intermolecular distance in high density. As a result,
the fluorescence intensity dramatically decreased even in low photocyclization
conversion of diarylethenes, which resulted in highly efficient
fluorescence on/off switching properties. Although highly efficient
fluorescence on/off switchable systems consisting of diarylethenes
and fluorophores, such as dyad,17 polymers,25−28 silica nanoparticles,29,30 and organic nanoparticles,31−33 have been reported, a complicated multistep synthesis is required
to construct the fluorescence switchable systems. If a more convenient
system with highly efficient fluorescence on/off switching properties
can be constructed, it will lead to the development of the fluorescence
on/off switchable system and great contribution to the applications
as described above.

Here, we have focused on nanoparticles consisting
of two types
of diarylethenes, 1,2-bis(3-methyl-5-phenyl-2-thienyl)perfluorocyclopentene
(1a), and 1,2-bis(2-methyl-5-phenyl-3-thienyl)perfluorocyclopentene
(2a), as shown in Scheme 1. Diarylethene 1a undergoes reversible
photochromic reactions in n-hexane and exhibits blue
fluorescence in the open-ring form with a fluorescence quantum yield
(Φf) of 0.017.34 The closed-ring
form (1b) exhibits no fluorescence. On the other hand,
crystals consisting of diarylethene 1a exhibit strong
fluorescence. Crystal 1a has two polymorphic forms (crystals 1a-α and 1a-β), which exhibit orange
and yellow fluorescence (Φf = 0.52 and 0.50), respectively.35 In addition, the open-ring form of crystal which
is produced by the photochemical ring-opening reaction in the crystal
of 1b exhibits green fluorescence (Φf = 0.15).36 However, all crystals do not
undergo photocyclization reaction. Diarylethene 2a undergoes
reversible photochromic reactions in solution and the crystalline
phase.37 Therefore, diarylethenes 1a and 2a are expected to behave as a fluorophore
and a photochromic compound in the nanoparticles, respectively. Because 1a and 2a have similar geometrical structures,
it is expected that the fabricated nanoparticles are evenly space-distributed
spheres consisting of 1a and 2a at an arbitrary
ratio, even if there is no covalent bonding between them. In addition,
it is easy to prepare their diarylethenes from commercially available
reagents in two or three steps.35,37 Therefore, the fluorescence
switchable system in this work is much more convenient as compared
with those proposed previously.

Scheme 1 Molecular Structures of Diarylethenes
Used in This Work
In this work, first, the photochromic and fluorescence
properties
of single-component nanoparticles consisting of 1a, 1b, 2a, or 2b (NP1a, NP1b, NP2a, or NP2b) were investigated to reveal the optical properties
of 1 and 2 in the nanoparticles. Next, double-component
nanoparticles consisting of 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b (NP1a/2a, NP1b/2a, NP1a/2b, and NP1b/2b) were fabricated to investigate the fluorescence on/off switching
properties. The dependence of the fluorescence on/off switching properties
of the nanoparticles on Förster distance and molar fraction
was revealed.

Results and Discussion
Photochromic and Fluorescence
Properties of Nanoparticles Consisting
of Diarylethene 1
Single-component nanoparticles
of 1a and 1b were successfully fabricated
by the reprecipitation method as described in the Experimental Section [dynamic light scattering (DLS) size
distributions are shown in Figure S1]. Figure 1 shows the absorption
and fluorescence spectra of NP1a and NP1b. The optical properties
of NP1a and NP1b are summarized in Table 1, together with those of diarylethene 1 in n-hexane and in the crystalline state.
The absorption maximum wavelength (λabs) for NP1a was observed at 387 nm, which
is almost the same as that of 1a in n-hexane. On the other hand, the fluorescence maximum wavelength (λflu) for NP1a was observed
at 596 nm, which was shifted toward longer wavelength than that of 1a in n-hexane (λflu = 480
nm). In addition, the fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) of NP1a was determined to
be 0.20. This value was much larger than that of 1a in n-hexane (Φf = 0.017).34 Moreover, NP1a did
not undergo photocyclization reaction from the open-ring form to the
closed-ring form upon irradiation with UV light. It was revealed that 1a in the nanoparticle behaves as a fluorophore.

On the other hand, the optical properties of NP1b were significantly different
from those of NP1a. NP1b has the absorption band around 450 nm,
as shown in Figure 1b. Upon irradiation
with visible light (>500 nm), 1b in NP1b exhibited the ring-opening reaction from
the
closed-ring isomer to the open-ring isomer. The absorption band at
450 nm disappeared, and a sharp band around 400 nm appeared. Here,
the open-ring isomer photogenerated from the closed-ring isomer is
called 1a′, and the nanoparticle consisting of 1a′ is called NP1a′. NP1a′ did not
undergo photocyclization reaction upon irradiation with UV light,
as well as NP1a. At the present
work, the reason why 1a does not undergo photocyclization
reaction in the nanoparticle state is not clear yet. Although NP1b exhibited no fluorescence upon
excitation at 365 nm, NP1a′ exhibited green fluorescence, as shown in Figure 1d. λflu was observed at
544 nm with Φf of 0.05. The fluorescence properties
of NP1a′ are clearly different
from those of NP1a.

As
mentioned above, crystal 1a has two crystalline
polymorphic forms (crystals 1a-α and 1a-β). Crystals 1a-α and 1a-β exhibit
the red-shifted strong fluorescence (λflu = 601 nm,
Φf = 0.52 for crystal 1a-α and
λflu = 570 nm, Φf = 0.50 for crystal 1a-β)35 in comparison with
that of 1a in n-hexane (λflu = 480 nm, Φf = 0.017).34 In addition, crystal 1a′ exhibited
green fluorescence with λflu = 491 nm and Φf = 0.15.36 However, the fluorescence
properties of these crystals are slightly different from those of
the nanoparticles. This suggests that the nanoparticles are not in
the crystalline state.

To reveal the state of the nanoparticles,
powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) measurement was performed. As shown in Figure S2, PXRD on NP1a and NP1a′ showed only
a hollow pattern, which indicates that both NP1a and NP1a′ are in the amorphous state. In the excitation spectrum, NP1a has a small shoulder band in the region
of 450–550 nm, whereas such a shoulder band was not observed
in NP1a′, as shown in Figure S3. Crystals 1a-α and 1a-β also have the large band in the region of 450–550
nm in the reflection spectra, which is attributed to the aggregates
with the intermolecular interaction of 1a.35 Therefore, NP1a is in the amorphous state containing a small part of the aggregates,
whereas NP1a′ is no aggregate
in the amorphous state.

Next, the fluorescence lifetimes of NP1a and NP1a′ were
compared. Figure S4 shows the fluorescence
decay curves of NP1a and NP1a′. Both NP1a and NP1a′ exhibited fluorescence decay with multiple components. The
faster component of <1 ns is attributed to the fluorescence of
a single molecule. On the other hand, the slower component of 1–5
ns is ascribed to the condensed state.36NP1a had a rise component of
0.014 ns. The rise component may be because of an energy transfer
from the excited energy in the single molecule to the condensed aggregate
state. Thus, the nanoparticles consisting of diarylethene 1a exhibited orange or green fluorescence depending on the
fabrication conditions of the nanoparticles.

Photochromism of Nanoparticles
Consisting of Diarylethene 2
Figure 2 shows the absorption
spectral changes of nanoparticles consisting
of 2a (NP2a) and 2b (NP2b) upon photoirradiation
(DLS size distributions are shown in Figure S5). Upon irradiation with 313 nm light, the colorless dispersion solution
of NP2a turned blue, and the
new absorption band appeared around 579 nm. The spectral change is
ascribed to the photocyclization reaction. Upon irradiation with visible
light, the solution color and absorption spectrum returned to the
initial state. The photocyclization conversion upon irradiation with
313 nm light was determined to be 87%. The value is unexpectedly high
although parallel and antiparallel conformers may coexist in NP2a. Diarylethene nanoparticles fabricated
by the reprecipitation method are usually amorphous solids; in some
cases, it may crystallize upon irradiation with microwave.24,38,39 To reveal the reason as to why
the photocyclization conversion upon irradiation with 313 nm is high,
the glass transition temperature of the amorphous solid materials
was examined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Figure S6). DSC trace of 2a in the
amorphous solid, which was prepared by melting crystal 2a followed by cooling to room temperature, exhibited a glass transition
temperature at 21 °C, which is lower than room temperature (25
°C). Thus, the photocyclization conversion in the nanoparticles
is high because the two conformers can interconvert with each other
even in the nanoparticles. In addition, NP2b exhibited a similar photochromic behavior upon alternating
the irradiation with UV and visible light. There was no difference
in the spectral changes between NP2a and NP2b, which is because
the antiparallel conformer can convert to parallel conformer in the
nanoparticles, as mentioned above. It was revealed that diarylethene 2 undergoes the reversible photochromic reactions in the nanoparticle
upon alternating irradiation with UV and visible light, even if the
nanoparticle is fabricated from either of 2a and 2b.

form (blue solid line), and the PSS upon irradiation with 313 nm light
(blue dashed line).

Fluorescence On/Off Switching
of Nanoparticles Consisting of
Diarylethenes 1 and 2
The fluorescence
on/off switching accompanying the photochromic reactions of the double-component
nanoparticles consisting of 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b (NP1a/2a, NP1b/2a, NP1a/2b, and NP1b/2b) was investigated. The DLS size distributions of the nanoparticles
are shown in Figures S7–S10. We
determined the average diameters to be 100–170 nm and estimated
the number of the molecules (sum of 1 and 2) per single nanoparticle to be 8.5 × 105 to 4.2
× 106 by assuming that the density of the nanoparticles
is the same as those of 1 and 2 in the crystalline
phase (≈1.4 g cm–3). Figure 3a,b shows the absorption spectra of NP1a/2a and NP1b/2a, respectively, at the same molar fraction of 1 and 2. Two bands were observed around 385 and
285 nm in the initial absorption spectrum of NP1a/2a. The band around 385 nm is mainly attributed to 1a, and the band around 285 nm corresponds to those of 1a and 2a. Upon irradiation with 313 nm light,
the absorption band of 2b appeared around 580 nm. On
the other hand, 1a did not undergo photocyclization reaction.
The absorption band of 2b disappeared upon irradiation
with visible light. Next, in the initial absorption spectrum of NP1b/2a, the absorption band of 1b was observed around 450 nm. Upon irradiation with visible
light, the absorption band disappeared and the band of the photogenerated 1a (1a′) appeared. 1a′ in NP1a′/2a also did
not undergo photocyclization reaction, as well as 1a′ in NP1a′ upon irradiation
with 313 nm light. On the other hand, 2a underwent the
photocyclization reaction upon irradiation with 313 nm. The photocyclization
conversions of diarylethene 2a upon irradiation with
313 nm light were determined to be 83 and 78% for NP1a/2a and NP1a′/2a, respectively.

Figure 3 Absorption and fluorescence spectra of (a,c) NP1a/2a (1a/2a =
1:1, d = 107 ± 23 nm) and (b,d) NP1b/2a (1b/2a =
1:1, d = 175 ± 48 nm) in water/THF (97:3): 1a and 2a (solid line), 1b and 2a (dotted line), and 1a and 2 at
the PSS
upon irradiation with 313 nm light (dashed line).

The photochromic properties of NP1a/2b and NP1b/2b (NP1a′/2b) were also
investigated, as
shown in Figures S11 and S12. They hardly
changed in comparison with those of NP1a/2a and NP1b/2a (NP1a′/2b). Therefore, it was revealed
that the photochromic properties of the double-component nanoparticles
can be explained by the summation of those of the single-component
nanoparticles.

NP1a/2a and NP1a′/2a exhibited orange and
green
fluorescence as shown in Figure 3c,d, respectively. The origin of the different color
fluorescence between NP1a/2a and NP1a′/2a is the same as that
between NP1a and NP1a′. The fluorescence intensities
quickly decreased upon irradiation with 313 nm light, as shown in Figure 4a. The fluorescence
was completely quenched at the PSS. This is ascribed to an energy
transfer from the excited state 1a (or 1a′) to 2b. Upon irradiation with visible light, the fluorescence
intensities returned to their initial ones. Therefore, NP1a/2a and NP1a′/2a exhibited the fluorescence on/off switching upon alternating
irradiation with UV and visible light. There was no significant difference
between NP1a/2a and NP1a′/2a in the photocyclization reaction
rate. On the other hand, the fluorescence on/off switching of NP1a/2a was faster than that of NP1a′/2a. Figure 4b shows the relative fluorescence
intensity (F/F0) relative
to the photocyclization conversion of 2a. The F/F0 values for NP1a/2a and NP1a′/2a nonlinearly decreased with the increasing photocyclization
conversion of 2a. This is due to quenching of the excited
state energy of a lot of 1a (or 1a′) by a single 2b in the nanoparticles. The fluorescence
for NP1a/2a and NP1a′/2a was almost quenched when the
photocyclization conversion was around 5 and 15%, respectively, which
indicates that the number of 1a quenched by a single 2b in NP1a/2a is larger
than that in NP1a′/2a.
This is considered to be ascribed to the difference in Förster
distance (R0) between 1a (or 1a′) and 2b in the nanoparticles because
the fluorescence on/off switching in this work is based on the Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) from 1a (or 1a′) to 2b.24 The R0 value can be described as follows40 1  where Φf is the fluorescence
quantum yield of donor in the absence of the acceptor, κ2 is the orientation factor, NA is the Avogadro constant, and n is the refractive
index of the medium. J is an overlap integral and
is estimated by using eq 2. 2  where λ is the wavelength of
the light,
εA(λ) is the molar extinction coefficient of
the acceptor, and fD(λ) is the normalized
fluorescence spectrum of the donor. The R0 values for NP1a/2a and NP1a′/2a were determined to
be 4.0 and 3.1 nm, respectively, based on eq 1 using the absorption coefficient of 2b in THF (λabs = 587 nm, εabs = 17 800 M–1 cm–1) (Figure S13), the Φf values for NP1a and NP1a′, κ2 = 2/3 of random orientations,
and the refractive index of THF. This result indicates that a longer
Förster distance results in a larger number of 1a (or 1a′) quenched by a single 2b and the faster fluorescence on/off switching.

conversion and normalized fluorescence intensity

mW cm–2) for NP1a/2a (1a/2a = 1:1, d = 131 ± 26 nm) (orange circles) and NP1a′/2a (1a′/2a = 1:1, d = 167 ± 37 nm) (green circles) in
water/THF (97:3). (b) Normalized fluorescence intensity excited at
410 nm relative to the photocyclization conversion for NP1a/2a, NP1a/2b, NP1a′/2a, and NP1a′/2b in water/THF (97:3).

Figure 5 shows repeating
cycles of the fluorescence on/off switching of NP1a/2a and NP1a′/2a upon alternating the irradiation with UV and visible light,
which could be repeated 50 times although decreases in 38 and 15%
of the fluorescence intensity for NP1a/2a and NP1a′/2a,
respectively, were observed after 50 cycles. To reveal the reason
as to why the decrease in the fluorescence intensity of NP1a/2a was large in comparison with that of NP1a′/2a, first, we investigate
the fluorescence intensity changes of NP1a and NP1a′ upon
irradiation with 313 nm light (Figure S14). The fluorescence intensities hardly decreased after irradiation
with 313 nm light for 25 min. The result revealed that the reason
as to why the fluorescence intensities of NP1a/2a and NP1a′/2a decreased upon repeating cycles is not the degradation of 1a and 1a′. Next, a stability of 2 was investigated. The absorbance around 285 nm for NP1a/2a, which is ascribed to 2a, slightly decreased after 50 repeating cycles (Figure S15). In addition, absorbance of 2b around 580 nm also decreased at the PSS. These results
indicate that 2 in NP1a/2a is degraded upon repeating cycles of the fluorescence on/off
switching. A previous study for fatigue resistance of 2 revealed that a photostable byproduct, which has an absorption maximum
wavelength at 547 nm, is produced upon repeating the photochromic
reactions.41 We could not confirm the byproduct
in the absorption spectra because the amount of the byproduct produced
by repeating the fluorescence on/off switching may be very small.
A small amount of byproduct is sufficient to decrease the fluorescence
intensity because a large number of the fluorophores are quenched
by a single quencher in the nanoparticles. We considered the fact
that the small amount of the byproduct quenched the fluorescence of 1a (or 1a′) in the nanoparticles. Furthermore, it is considered that the decrease in the fluorescence intensity
of NP1a/2a was large in comparison
with that of NP1a′/2a,
which is because of the high efficiency of energy transfer from 1a to the byproduct in comparison with that from 1a′ to the byproduct due to the stronger fluorescence of NP1a/2a in comparison with that of NP1a′/2a. The fatigue resistance of
the fluorescence on/off switching in this work is low. However, we
could provide an important knowledge that it is necessary to select
a highly fatigue-resistant diarylethene to improve the fatigue resistance
of the fluorescence on/off switching in the aggregated states.

fluorescence on/off switching of (a) NP1a/2a (1a/2a =
1:1, d = 131 ± 26 nm) and (b) NP1a′/2a (1a′/2a = 1:1, d = 167 ± 37 nm) in water/THF
(97:3) upon alternating irradiation with 313 nm light (for 30 s, 0.45
mW cm–2 (a) and 60 s, 0.48 mW cm–2 (b)) and visible light for 3 min (>500 nm).

Next, the dependence of the fluorescence on/off switching
properties
on the molar fraction of 1 and 2 was investigated. Figures S16 and S17 show the absorption and fluorescence
spectra of NP1a/2a and NP1b/2a with various molar fractions
of 1 and 2. All of the nanoparticles underwent
reversible photochromism and exhibited the fluorescence on/off switching
upon alternating the irradiation with UV and visible light. The change
of the F/F0 value relative
to the photocyclization conversion decreased with decreasing molar
fraction of 2 as shown in Figure 6. In other words, the larger molar fraction
of 2 results in the more efficient fluorescence on/off
switching properties.

Figure 6 Normalized fluorescence intensity excited at 410 nm as
a function
of the photocyclization conversion of NP1a/2a in water/THF (97:3).

We have tried to quantitatively evaluate the dependence of
the
fluorescence on/off switching of the double-component nanoparticles
on Förster distance and molar fraction. In a previous paper,
a simplified model was proposed to quantitatively evaluate the amplified
fluorescence on/off switching of the nanoparticles consisting of a
diarylethene linked to a benzothiadiazole derivative.24 This model assumes that the fluorophore is not quenched
when all diarylethenes are in their open-ring forms within R0 and completely quenched in all other cases.
In the model, the relative fluorescence intensity (F/F0) is consistent with (1 – αCF)n; where αCF is the photocyclization conversion of diarylethene and n is the number of molecules within R0. There are two types of molecules, that is, diarylethene open- and
closed-ring forms in the model. On the other hand, in this work, there
are three types of molecules, that is, diarylethenes 1a (or 1a′), 2a, and 2b at arbitrary ratio in the nanoparticles. Therefore, the model cannot
be directly used for the nanoparticles in this work. Here, to quantitatively
evaluate the dependence of the fluorescence on/off switching of the
nanoparticles on Förster distance and molar fraction, the model
was modified as follows 3  where β is molar fraction
of diarylethene 2 in the nanoparticles and (1 –
βαCF) is the probability that a molecule in
the nanoparticle
is not 2b. The fitted curve based on eq 3 matched the experimental data for NP1a/2a and NP1a/2b when the n value was 250, as
shown in Figure 4b.
Therefore, when the molar fraction of 1 and 2 in NP1a/2a and NP1a/2b is the same (β = 0.5), a single 2b quenched around 125 molecules of 1a (=n × (1 – β)) in the initial fluorescence
quenching process. On the other hand, the n value
was estimated to be 105 for NP1a′/2a and NP1a′/2b,
which is smaller than that in NP1a/2a and NP1a/2b. Therefore,
the fluorescence on/off switching speed of NP1a/2a and NP1a/2b is faster than that of NP1a′/2a and NP1a′/2b because
the number of 1a quenched by a single 2b in NP1a/2a and NP1a/2b is ca. 2.4 times larger than that in NP1a′/2a and NP1a′/2b because of the longer Förster
distance. Therefore, the multicolor fluorescence properties of 1a in the nanoparticles revealed the dependence of the fluorescence
on/off switching of the nanoparticles on Förster distance.
Here, it was hypothesized that the density of the nanoparticles is
the same as that in the crystalline phase of 1 and 2 (≈1.4 g cm–3), and the nanoparticles
are evenly space distributed spheres. By using these hypotheses and
the n values, the distances that 2b can
quench 1a (or 1a′) were calculated
to be 3.3 and 2.5 nm for NP1a/2a (and NP1a/2b) and NP1a′/2a (and NP1a′/2b), respectively. The values are close to
the R0 values calculated by the Förster
equation. This result indicates that the fluorescence on/off switching
of the nanoparticles is mainly based on FRET process from 1a (or 1a′) to 2b although various
energy-transfer processes, such as FRET, Dexter-type energy transfer,
and energy migration, may contribute to the fluorescence quenching
because the distance between the molecules is short enough to cause
the energy-transfer processes.

FRET efficiency depends on the
distance between a donor and an
acceptor.40 However, we used eq 3 for the fluorescence on/off switching
analysis of the nanoparticles because it is difficult to make the
model in consideration with the distance dependence. To determine
if it is appropriate to use the model for the analysis, the fluorescence
lifetimes of NP1a/2a at various
photocyclization conversions were measured (Figure S18). NP1a/2a exhibited
fluorescence decay with multiple components as well as NP1a (Table S1).
The average fluorescence lifetime (τAVE) values,
which were calculated from these values according to τAVE = Σ(τi × %), decreased with increasing
photocyclization conversion. However, the change was much smaller
in comparison with that of the fluorescence intensity. This result
indicates that 2b almost quenched the fluorescence of 1a within R0 in the nanoparticles
and is close to the assumption in the model. Therefore, we concluded
that it is available to use the modified model for the fluorescence
on/off switching analysis of the nanoparticles.

In addition,
the fitting curves calculated by eq 3 could match the all-experimental data of NP1a/2a and NP1a/2b at various molar fractions of 1 and 2 when the n value was constant at 250 and
the β value was changed, as shown in Figure 6. Therefore, when molar fraction (β)
for 2 was 0.5, 0.17, and 0.091, the number of 1a quenched by a single 2b was 125, 208, and 227, respectively,
in the initial fluorescence-quenching process. This number increased
with the decreasing molar fraction of 2. This is because
the probability that other 2b molecules are present around 2b decreases with the decreasing molar fraction of 2. However, the change of the F/F0 value relative to the photocyclization conversion increased
with the increasing molar fraction of 2, as mentioned
above. Therefore, a larger number of quencher, that is, 2b, leads to improve the apparent fluorescence on/off switching properties
of the nanoparticles. However, in the case of single molecule in the
nanoparticles, the opposite trend was observed. Thus, there is a trade-off
relationship between the fluorescence on/off switching properties
of the whole nanoparticle solution and the number of 1a quenched by a single 2b in the nanoparticles. As a
result, we could quantitatively evaluate the dependence of the fluorescence
on/off switching properties of the double-component nanoparticles
consisting of 1 and 2 on Förster
distance and molar fraction by using the modified model. We consider
that 1a can be replaced by other simple fluorophore if
the fluorophore is hydrophobic based on the results in this work.
This convenient system with highly efficient fluorescence on/off switching
properties will lead to the development of the fluorescence on/off
switchable system and great contribution to the applications.

Conclusions
We fabricated single- and double-component nanoparticles consisting
of diarylethenes 1 and/or 2 to develop a
convenient system with highly efficient fluorescence on/off switching
properties. The nanoparticles consisting of 1a exhibited
orange fluorescence with Φf = 0.20. On the other
hand, the nanoparticles consisting of 1b exhibited no
fluorescence, and green fluorescence was observed with Φf = 0.05 after irradiation with visible light. It was revealed
that the nanoparticles consisting of 1 exhibited multicolor
fluorescence depending on the fabrication conditions of the nanoparticles.
Moreover, 2 underwent reversible photochromic reactions
upon alternating irradiation with UV and visible light in the nanoparticle
state. The double-component nanoparticles consisting of 1 and 2 exhibited the fluorescence on/off switching with
rapid switching speed and high on/off contrast upon alternating irradiation
with UV and visible light. In addition, the fluorescence on/off switching
properties of the nanoparticles depended on molar fractions of 1 and 2, which is ascribed to the Förster
distance. The longer Förster distance and larger molar fraction
of 2 improved the fluorescence on/off switching properties,
which was supported by a simplified model. As a result, we accomplished
to construct the convenient and highly efficient fluorescence on/off
switchable system using the double-component nanoparticles consisting
of two types of diarylethenes.

Experimental Section
General
1H NMR spectra were recorded on
a Bruker AV-300N spectrometer at 300 MHz. Deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) was used as the solvent, and tetramethylsilane as an internal
standard. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed
using a Hitachi L-7150/L-2400 HPLC system equipped with a Kanto Chemical
Mightysil Si 60 column. PXRD profiles were recorded on a Rigaku MiniFlex
600 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184
Å). The nanoparticle size was determined by the DLS (Sysmex Zetasizer
Nano ZS) analysis. DSC was performed using a Hitachi DSC7000X instrument.
Absorption spectra were measured with a JASCO V-560 absorption spectrophotometer.
Photoirradiation in solution was conducted using a 200 W mercury-xenon
lamp (MORITEX MUV-202) as a light source. Monochromatic light was
obtained by passing the light through a monochromator (Jobin Yvon
H10 UV) and glass filters. Fluorescence spectra were measured with
a Hitachi F-2700 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Fluorescence quantum
yields were determined with a JASCO FP-8300 fluorescence spectrophotometer
equipped with a JASCO ILF-835 integrating sphere. All samples in solutions
were deaerated by bubbling with argon gas for 5 min before the measurements.

Fluorescence Lifetime
Fluorescence lifetimes were measured
using a time-correlated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) system. The
experimental setup for the TCSPC has been described previously.42 Briefly, a Ti:sapphire oscillator (Spectra-Physics,
Tsunami) was utilized as a pulsed light source. The operation wavelength,
pulse width, and repetition rate were set to 800 nm, 70 fs, and 80
MHz, respectively. The fundamentals of the laser were converted to
the second harmonics (400 nm) using a type I beta barium borate crystal
and used to excite the samples. The repetition rate was reduced down
to 8 MHz by using an electro-optic modulator (Conoptics, model 350),
and the excitation intensity to the samples was typically 2.2 μW
at 8 MHz. The detection of fluorescence at the magic-angle configuration
was attained by utilizing a film polarizer and a Babinet-Soleil compensator.
The fluorescence was detected using a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu
Photonics, R3809U-50) equipped with a preamplifier (Hamamatsu Photonics,
C5594) and a TCSPC module (PicoQuant, PicoHarp 300). For wavelength
selection, a monochromator (Princeton Instruments, Acton 2150) was
placed in front of the photomultiplier tube. The sample solutions
were set in 1 cm path length of the quartz cells. The typical response
time of the system was determined to be 40 ps full width at half maximum
by detecting the scattered photons from a colloidal solution.

Materials
1,2-Bis(3-methyl-5-phenyl-2-thienyl)perfluorocyclopentene
(1a)35 and 1,2-bis(2-methyl-5-phenyl-3-thienyl)perfluorocyclopentene
(2a)37 were prepared by the
method described previously. The closed-ring isomers of 1a and 2a (1b and 2b) were prepared
by irradiation with UV light of the n-hexane solution
and were isolated by HPLC equipped with a silica-gel column using n-hexane as the eluant.

Preparation of Nanoparticles
Nanoparticles were prepared
by the reprecipitation method.43NP1a or NP1b was prepared as follows: THF solution of 1a or 1b was prepared by dissolving 1a or 1b (1.9 mg) into THF (2.0 mL). The THF solution of 1a or 1b (300 μL) was quickly added to 10 mL of
distilled water, followed by vigorous stirring for 30 min. The fabricated
solution of NP1a or NP1b was used for the experiments just as it
is. NP2a or NP2b was prepared as follows: the THF solution of 2a or 2b was prepared by dissolving 2a or 2b (3.8 mg) into THF (2.0 mL). The THF solution
of 2a or 2b (10 μL) was quickly added
to 4.0 mL of distilled water, followed by vigorous stirring for 30
min. The fabricated solution of NP2a or NP2b was used for
the experiments just as it is. Double-component nanoparticles (NP1a/2a, NP1b/2a, NP1a/2b,
and NP1b/2b) were prepared as
follows: the THF solution of 1a or 1b was
prepared by dissolving 1a or 1b (3.8 mg)
into THF (2.0 mL). The THF solution of 2a or 2b was prepared by dissolving 2a or 2b (3.8
mg) into THF (2.0, 10, and 20 mL). The THF solutions containing 1 and 2 at an arbitrary ratio ([1]/[2] = 1/1, 1/0.2, and 1/0.1) were prepared by mixing
each THF solution (each 1.0 mL) containing 1 and 2. The THF solution of 1 and 2 (300
μL) was quickly added to 10 mL of distilled water followed by
vigorous stirring for 30 min. The fabricated solution of NP1a/2a, NP1b/2a, NP1a/2b, or NP1b/2b was used for the experiments just as
it is.
