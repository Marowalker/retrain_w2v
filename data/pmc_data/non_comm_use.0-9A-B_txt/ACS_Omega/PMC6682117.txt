To
ensure the stable operation of gas-insulated equipment, removal
of SF6 decomposition products of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is one of the best methods. SO2F2 is
one of the typical decomposition products of SF6, while
the Au-modified MoS2 (Au–MoS2) monolayer
is a novel gas adsorbent. Therefore, based on the first-principles
calculation, the adsorption properties of the SO2F2 molecule on the Au–MoS2 monolayer are calculated.
Furthermore, the adsorption energy, charge transfer, and structure
parameters were analyzed to obtain the most stable adsorption structure.
These results indicate that all of the adsorption processes are exothermic.
To better study the adsorption mechanism between the SO2F2 molecule and the Au–MoS2 monolayer,
the density of states, the highest occupied molecular orbital, the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and electron density difference
were obtained. At last, we conclude that the interaction between the
SO2F2 molecule and the Au–MoS2 monolayer was chemisorption. This study provides a theoretical basis
to prepare the Au–MoS2 monolayer for the removal
of SF6 decomposition products.

1 Introduction
Over the past decades,
sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) has
been widely used in gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) and other gas-insulated
equipment owing to its excellent insulating and arc extinguishing
properties.1 Even so, during the long-term
running equipment, partial discharge (PD) frequently occurs due to
the inevitable internal insulation defects.2,3 Previous
studies found that SF6 insulation gas will decompose to
low-fluorine sulfides (SFx, x = 1–5) under partial discharge.4,5 These decomposed
products would subsequently react with traces of gaseous O2 and H2O existing in SF6-insulated equipment
and form various characteristic decomposition products, including
SOF2, SO2F2, SO2, etc.6,7 The running stability of gas-insulated equipment can be greatly
affected by the decomposition products of SF6, which may
ultimately lead to the breakdown of the power system.8,9 To ensure the strong insulation of SF6-insulated equipment,
one of the effective approaches is to maintain the purity of the filled
gas, that is, removing the decomposition products of SF6 online.10,11 Considering the large concentration and
high chemical stability of SO2F2, it is urgent
to find an effective adsorbent for its removal.

Currently, the
MoS2 monolayer, with good chemical stability,
good thermal stability, high specific surface area, and high surface
activity, has become one of the research hotspots of gas adsorbent.12,13 Metal-modified MoS2 materials have been investigated
for application in gas molecules adsorption, which shows a broad application
prospect.14−16 Furthermore, based on the first-principles calculations,
researchers verified that a noble metal-modified MoS2 monolayer
shows great adsorption ability toward specific gas molecules.15,17 For MoS2 modification, Wang et al. studied the adsorption
and diffusion of noble metal atoms on MoS2 based on the
density functional theory (DFT).18−20 Studies proved that
metal modification can effectively enhance the chemical activity and
sensing sensitivity of modified MoS2 compared to that of
the intrinsic monolayer.21−23 Chen et al. studied the physical
adsorption between Au-modified MoS2 and gas molecules (SOF2 and SO2F2) that did not break the structure
of gas molecules.24 However, SOF2 and SO2F2 may also chemically adsorb on metal-modified
MoS2. For this reason, a Au catalyst-modified MoS2 monolayer was proposed as a highly effective adsorbent for SO2F2 removal in SF6-insulated equipment.25

In this study, based on the density functional
theory (DFT), the
adsorption of SO2F2 on the Au-modified MoS2 (Au–MoS2) monolayer with different initial
conditions was studied to systemically analyze the adsorption mechanism.26,27 The adsorption energy, charge transfer, electron density difference,
and density of states (DOS) were calculated to explore the interaction
mechanism between SO2F2 and Au–MoS2. This study results provide a theoretical basis for preparing
a Au–MoS2 monolayer adsorbent for SO2F2 removal in the experiment.

2 Result
and Discussion
2.1 Structural Property of
Gas Molecule Models
and Au–MoS2 Monolayer
Before gas adsorption,
to gain the most stable structure, the structures of a SF6 gas molecule and its decomposed product SO2F2 and the Au–MoS2 monolayer model were built and
optimized. Figure 1 shows the optimized structure of SO2F2 and
SF6 molecules. The bond lengths and the bond angles are
marked in the molecular structures. The central S atom in the SO2F2 molecule has an sp3 hybridization
with two O atoms and two F atoms. The same situation exists in the
SF6 molecule, where the S atom and the four F atoms have
an sp3 hybridization. The bond length of S–F in
SO2F2 is 1.611 Å, which is longer than
the S–O bond (1.442 Å) because of the smaller radius of
the O atom. The bond angle of O–S–F, F–S–F,
and O–S–O is 107.738, 94.355, and 126.741°, respectively.
The S–F bonds in the SF6 molecule are perpendicular
to each other, and the bond length is similar to the S–F bond
length in the SO2F2 molecule, which is 1.616
Å. Analysis of Mulliken atomic charges shows that the S atom
in the SO2F2 molecule has a positive charge
of 0.868e, while the O and F atoms have negative
charges of 0.214e and 0.220e, respectively.
However, the S atom in the SF6 molecule obtains a positive
charge of 1.194e, which is transferred from the F
atoms. A large number of electron transfers indicate that there is
a strong interaction between F atoms and S atom in the SF6 molecule, which ensures that the SF6 molecule has a very
stable structure.

Figure 1 Optimized structures of (a) SO2F2 molecule
and (b) SF6 molecule.

As shown in Figure 2, the Au atom approaches the Mo atom from the top site and
forms
bonds with three surrounding S atoms. The bond lengths of the Au–S
bond are 2.805 Å, and the Au atom shows a weak interaction with
the Mo atom because of the long distance between them (3.767 Å).
The bond angles of the Mo–S–Mo and S–Mo–S
in the MoS2 monolayer without Au atom modification are
both 81.55°. However, the bond angles slightly decreased to 81.34
and 80.99°, respectively, after Au modification. The obvious
changes of angle and the binding energy (−0.448 eV) indicate
that the modified Au atom has a strong interaction with the MoS2 monolayer. The carried charge of the Au atom after modification
was also calculated, which is −0.038e. This
indicates that the electron transfer from the Au atom to MoS2 and further verifies the above conclusion.

Figure 2 Top view (a) and side
view (b) of the Au–MoS2 monolayer.

To further investigate the influence of Au atom
modification on
the electronic properties of MoS2, the total density of
states (TDOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) of intrinsic
MoS2 and the Au–MoS2 monolayer were calculated,
as shown in Figure 3. It can be found that the waveform of TDOS nearly not changes except
a distinct left shift after Au atom modification. This means that
after the MoS2 monolayer is doped with Au atoms, the number
of electrons in the system increases and the metallicity is enhanced.
Near the Fermi level, the value of TDOS decreases significantly after
Au atom doping, which means that doping of Au atom evidently enhances
the metallic properties of MoS2. According to the PDOS,
the peaks of Au 5d orbitals and S 3p orbitals overlap at −5,
−3, and −2 eV, indicating that the d orbital strongly
hybridizes with the p orbital. Strong orbital hybridization means
that the Au atom and MoS2 monolayer can be well combined.

Figure 3 (a) TDOS
and (b) PDOS of Au–MoS2.

Furthermore, the band gap of MoS2 and Au–MoS2 was also calculated. It is found that the band gap changes
from 2.057 to 0.266 eV after modification. The reduction of the band
gap is conducive to electron transfer from the valence band and conduction
band. As a result, the modified Au atom acts as an active site to
form strong interaction between the Au–MoS2 monolayer
and the target gas molecules.

2.2 Adsorption
Structures of the SF6 Molecule
To ensure that
the Au–MoS2 monolayer
can act as an adsorbent for decomposition products of the SF6 molecule, we first studied the interaction mechanism between the
Au–MoS2 monolayer and the SF6 molecule
so as to ensure that the adsorbent would not affect SF6 molecules. Figure 4a–c shows one F atom, two F atoms, and three F atoms close
to the Au–MoS2 monolayer, respectively. According
to our analysis, the adsorption energies of the SF6 molecule
are −0.004, −0.001, and −0.003 eV and the transfer
charges are −0.116e, −0.021e, and −0.018e, respectively, in
three cases close to those of the Au–MoS2 monolayer,
indicating that there is only a weak force between the SF6 molecule and the Au–MoS2 monolayer. In the three
cases shown in Figure 4, the distance between the SF6 molecule and the Au–MoS2 monolayer is so far that it is difficult to form a bond and
the closest distance is 2.749 Å, which further verifies the above
conclusion. Therefore, we believe that the Au–MoS2 monolayer can be used to study as an adsorbent for the decomposition
products of the SF6 molecule.

2.3 Adsorption
Structures of Single and Double
SO2F2 Molecules
To obtain the most
stable adsorption structure, several adsorption structures with different
initial approaching sites were built for calculation. In this study,
adsorption of single and double SO2F2 molecules
was taken into account at the same time to systematically analyze
the adsorption ability of the Au–MoS2 monolayer
to the SO2F2 molecule. Figure 5 shows a typical adsorption of single SO2F2 molecule on the Au–MoS2 monolayer,
which shows the largest adsorption energy in all monomolecular adsorption
structures. The corresponding structural parameter, adsorption energy,
and total charge transfer of the SO2F2 molecule
adsorbed on the Au–MoS2 monolayer are given in Table 1. For double SO2F2 molecule adsorption, two typical structures
were obtained, as shown in Figure 6, with its parameters exhibited in Table 2. As the negative adsorption
energy shown in Tables 1 and 2, the adsorption process of the SO2F2 molecule on the Au–MoS2 monolayer
is exothermic, indicating that the adsorption process is spontaneous.

As shown in Figure 5 and Table 1, the
Au–MoS2 monolayer shows strong adsorption to the
SO2F2 molecule with an adsorption energy of
−0.559 eV. When the SO2F2 molecule approaches
the surface of the Au–MoS2 monolayer, the F1 atom
separates from the SO2F2 molecule and approaches
the modified Au atom with an Au–F1 bond length of 2.012 Å,
indicating a chemical interaction between the SO2F2 molecule and the Au–MoS2 monolayer. The
corresponding charge transfer values, Qt, calculated by Mulliken and Hirshfeld methods are −0.614e and −0.461e, respectively. Therefore,
the SO2F2 molecule acts as an electron donor
and the Au–MoS2 monolayer acts as an electron acceptor.
The bond lengths of S–O1 and S–O2 increase to 1.483
and 1.485 Å, respectively. The distance between the Au atom and
the adjacent Mo atom changes from 3.740 to 4.223 Å, and the bond
length of S–F2 also increases. Therefore, a preliminary conclusion
can be drawn from the above analysis that the Au–MoS2 monolayer can effectively adsorb the SO2F2 molecule.

To fully analyze the adsorption capacity of the
Au–MoS2 monolayer to the SO2F2 molecules, it
is necessary to explore the adsorption of double SO2F2 molecules. Therefore, we constructed all kinds of configurations
with double SO2F2 molecules adsorbing on the
Au–MoS2 monolayer. Figure 6 shows the most stable adsorption structure
of double SO2F2 molecules adsorbed on the Au–MoS2 monolayer; the S–F1 bond of the SO2F2 molecule is broken in the adsorption process, and the S atom
and F1 atom rebond to the Au atom. However, the other SO2F2 molecule keeps away from the Au modification site with
a really long distance (3.778 Å) due to the repulsive force between
gas molecules. The Qt by Mulliken for
double molecules is −0.664e and −0.007e, manifesting the weak interaction of the Au–MoS2 monolayer toward the second molecule. In addition, comparing
with the adsorption structures for the corresponding parameters of
single and double SO2F2 molecule adsorption,
we conclude that double gas molecule adsorption is basically similar
to that of single gas molecule adsorption.

2.4 Electronic
Property
To explore the
interaction mechanism between the SO2F2 molecule
and the Au–MoS2 monolayer surface, the density of
state (DOS), the molecular orbital theory (highest occupied molecule
orbital, HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecule orbital, LUMO), and the
electron density difference are discussed.

Figure 7a1,b1 shows the TDOS before
and after SO2F2 molecule adsorption, and Figure 7a2,b2 presents the
PDOS of the characteristic atoms after SO2F2 molecule adsorption. For bimolecular SO2F2 adsorption, only one molecule is closer to the surface of the Au–MoS2 monolayer. Therefore, only the SO2F2 molecule that is close to the Au–MoS2 monolayer
is analyzed in PDOS analysis.

Figure 7 TDOS and PDOS: (a1)–(a2) single SO2F2 adsorption and (b1)–(b2) double SO2F2 adsorption.

It is obvious that SO2F2 molecule adsorption
significantly changes the distribution of TDOS, which is mainly because
of the interaction among Au 5d orbital, F 2p orbital, O 2p orbital,
and S 3p orbital. For single SO2F2 molecule
adsorption, the 6s and 5d orbitals of the Au atom, the 2p orbital
of the F atom, and the 2p orbital of the O atom overlap in the range
of −0.3–0 eV, as the PDOS shows in Figure 7a2. The large overlapped area
among Au 5d, F 2p, and O 2p indicates that these orbitals are highly
hybridized during the adsorption process. The overlap between the
F 2p orbital and the Au 5d orbital is larger than the overlap between
the O 2p orbital and the Au 5d orbital, resulting in the formation
of a new Au–F bond during the adsorption process. For the TDOS
of double SO2F2 adsorption, as shown in Figure 7b2,c2, a large overlapping
area exists among Au 5d, F1 2p, and S1 3p from −0.3 to 0 eV,
indicating a strong hybridization between the SO2F2 molecule and the Au–MoS2 monolayer. Comparing
the changes in TDOS and PDOS, the hybridization degree of double SO2F2 molecule adsorption is similar to that of single
SO2F2 molecule adsorption.

To further
analyze the electronic property of the SO2F2 molecule adsorbed on the Au–MoS2 monolayer,
molecule orbital theory is taken into consideration. The distributions
for highest occupied molecule orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecule orbital (LUMO) are exhibited in Figure 8, and the HOMO energy (EHOMO), LUMO energy (ELUMO),
and the energy gap (Eg) between HOMO and
LUMO are also given in the figure.

Figure 8 HOMO and LUMO distributions and related
energies for Au–MoS2 systems: (a) Au–MoS2; (b) Au–MoS2/SO2F2; and (c) Au–MoS2/2SO2F2.

HOMO and LUMO energies for intrinsic
Au–MoS2 are
−5.402 and −5.112 eV, respectively, with an Eg of 0.290 eV. According to the orbital distributions
of HOMO and LUMO for single SO2F2 molecule adsorption,
the energy gap of Au–MoS2/SO2F2 increases to 0.981 eV, indicating that the SO2F2 molecule adsorption greatly decreases the conductivity. For the
orbital distributions of double SO2F2 molecule
adsorption systems, the HOMO and LUMO only distribute on one gas molecule
that is close to the Au modification site. The adsorption results
of double gas molecule adsorption are similar to that of single gas
molecule adsorption, and the HOMO and LUMO energies decline after
adsorption. When the double SO2F2 molecules
adsorb on the Au–MoS2 monolayer, the energy gap
has a little increase to 0.507 eV because of the repulsive force between
gas molecules. Since the electrons in HOMO and LUMO are mainly located
in the surrounding gas adsorbates, the energy reduction of EHOMO, ELUMO, and Eg confirms the strong interaction between the
SO2F2 molecule and the Au–MoS2 monolayer. As a result, SO2F2 molecule adsorption
decreases the conductivity of the Au–MoS2 system.
Therefore, we can draw a conclusion that there is chemical adsorption
between the single SO2F2 molecule and the Au–MoS2 monolayer.

The electron density difference of the SO2F2 molecule adsorbed on the Au–MoS2 monolayer with
different systems is shown in Figure 9, where the increase and decrease of the electron density
are represented by red and blue regions, respectively.

Figure 9 Electron density difference:
(a) single SO2F2 adsorption and (b) double SO2F2 adsorption.

For single SO2F2 molecule adsorption,
as
shown in Figure 9a,
both of the F atoms receive tiny electrons, while the electron density
near the S atom decreases, which is in agreement with the conclusion
that the SO2F2 molecule transfers quite a part
of electrons to the adsorbent. For the double SO2F2 molecule adsorption, as shown in Figure 9b, the electron density near the Au atom
decreases, which is similar to that of single SO2F2 molecule adsorption. For the SO2F2 molecule
close to the Au atom, the electron density of the S atom suffers a
decrease. For the other SO2F2 molecule away
from the Au–MoS2 monolayer surface, the electron
density changes slightly. Therefore, we conclude that the SO2F2 molecule acts as the electron acceptor and the Au–MoS2 monolayer acts as the electron donor in the SO2F2 molecule adsorption process. All of these indicate
that there is a certain amount of electron transfer between the SO2F2 molecule and the Au–MoS2 monolayer,
which provides a factual basis for the stable adsorption of the SO2F2 molecule on the Au–MoS2 monolayer.

3 Conclusions
In this study, the interaction
mechanism between the SO2F2 molecule and the
Au–MoS2 monolayer
surface was analyzed based on DFT calculations. First, the most stable
structures of SO2F2 and the Au–MoS2 monolayer were discussed. Then, the most stable structures
of single SO2F2 molecule adsorption and double
SO2F2 molecule adsorption structures were obtained
based on lots of initial adsorption structures. The density of states,
HOMO and LUMO distributions, and electron density difference were
analyzed to further explore its adsorption mechanism. It is found
that the SO2F2 molecule tends to chemically
adsorb on the surface of the Au–MoS2 monolayer and
the adsorption energies of the single SO2F2 molecule
and the double SO2F2 molecules are up to −0.559
and −0.681 eV, respectively, indicating a strong interaction
between the SO2F2 molecule and the Au–MoS2 monolayer. In addition, the adsorption of the SO2F2 molecule can significantly change the conductivity
and charge distribution of the Au–MoS2 monolayer.
Due the remarkable interaction between the SO2F2 molecule and the Au–MoS2 monolayer, the Au-modified
MoS2 monolayer can be used as a promising adsorbent on
removing the typical decomposition products of SF6.

4 Computational Details
All of the calculations in this
paper were carried out based on
DFT.28−30 The generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
functional was chosen to calculate the electron exchange and correlation
energy.31,32 The double numerical plus polarization was
used as the basis set, and the density functional semicore pseudopotential
was applied for core treatment.33,34 All of the geometry
optimizations were performed with the energy tolerance accuracy, maximum
force, and maximum displacement of 1.0 × 10–5 Ha, 2.0 × 10–3 Ha/Å, and 5.0 ×
10–3 Å, respectively.35,36 The self-consistent field was set to 1.0 × 10–6 Ha.37,38 The Brillouin zone was determined by the
5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point
sampling method.39,40

To avoid the interaction
between adjacent structures, a 4 ×
4 × 1 MoS2 monolayer supercell with a 15 Å vacuum
layer was constructed. The optimized lattice constant of MoS2 is 3.180 Å in this study, which is consistent with other experimental
and theoretical results.41 In the center
of the 4 × 4 × 1 MoS2 monolayer supercell, one
Au atom was added at the top of the Mo atom, which bonds with three
S atoms.

The adsorption energy (Eads) of the
gas molecule on the Au–MoS2 monolayer is defined
by eq 1 and the unit
is eV, where EAu–MoS2/gas molecule is the total energy of the system after adsorption and EAu–MoS2 and Egas molecule represent the total energies of the Au–MoS2 monolayer
and the free gas molecule, respectively. The negative value of Eads indicates that the adsorption process is
exothermic and happens spontaneously. 1  The charge transfer (Qt) between the
gas molecule and the Au–MoS2 monolayer can be obtained
by eq 2 and the unit
is e, where Qads represents
the carried charge of the gas
molecule after adsorption and Qiso represents
the carried charge of the gas molecule before adsorption. A negative Qt means charges transfer from the Au–MoS2 monolayer to the gas molecule. 2  The binding energy of the Au–MoS2 monolayer is defined in eq 3 and the unit is eV, where EAu–MoS2 is the total energy of the Au atom-modified MoS2 monolayer and EAu and EMoS2 represent the total energy of
the isolated Au atom and the intrinsic MoS2 monolayer,
respectively. The negative Ebind indicates
that the binding process is exothermic. 3
