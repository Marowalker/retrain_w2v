Recently,
synthesis, characterization, and application of carbon dots have received much attention. Natural
products are the effectual carbon precursors to synthesize carbon
dots with fascinating chemical and physical properties. In this study,
the fluorescent sensor of carbon dots derived from cranberry beans
without any functionalization and modification was developed. The
carbon dots were prepared with a cheap, facile, and green carbon precursor
through a hydrothermal treatment method. The synthetic process was
toxic chemical-free, convenient, and environmentally friendly. To
find the optimized synthetic conditions, the temperature, heating
time duration, and carbon precursor weight were evaluated. The prepared
carbon dots were characterized by UV light, transmission electron
microscopy, Raman, Fourier transform infrared, UV–vis, and
fluorescence spectroscopy. The resulting carbon dots exhibit stable
fluorescence with a quantum yield of approximately 10.85%. The carbon
dots emitted the broad fluorescence emission range between 410 and
540 nm by changing the excitation wavelength and were used for the
detection of Fe3+ ions at the excitation of 380 nm. It
is found that Fe3+ ions induced the fluorescence intensity
quenching of the carbon dots stronger than other heavy metals and
the Fe3+ ion detection can be achieved within 3 min. Spectroscopic
data showed that the obtained carbon dots can detect Fe3+ ions within the wide concentration range of 30–600 μM
with 9.55 μM detection limit.

Introduction
Nowadays, carbon dots
(CDs) receive much attention in the size
of around or below 10 nm. The structures and components of CDs have
many diverse and superior properties, which, in turn, decide their
application since they were discovered in 2004.1 The structures, properties, and applications of CDs were
mainly based on their carbon precursors. One of the most important
properties of the CDs is their fluorescence (FL) character.2 CDs have many properties and advantages over
the conventional semiconductor quantum dots or traditional FL dyes,
such as tunable wavelength, chemical inertness, good photostability,
small size, less toxicity, environmental friendliness, high biocompatibility,
high solubility, good selectivity, good sensitivity, and simple modification.3 Because of their advantages with good properties,
CDs were applied in many sectors, such as bioimaging, biosensor, biomedicine
delivery system, light-emitting devices, dye-sensitized and organic
solar cells, photocatalysis, and chemical sensors.4 To date, many efforts have been employed on the synthesis
of CDs due to their superior properties and wide applications. Various
bottom-up (microwave, thermal decomposition, hydrothermal treatment,
template routes, and plasma treatment) and top-down (arc-discharge,
laser ablation, ultrasonic treatment, electrochemical oxidation, and
chemical oxidation) approaches are used to synthesize CDs.5 From these methods, hydrothermal treatment has
been widely used to synthesize CDs because of their simplicity of
preparation, easy control of reaction, low consumption of energy,
and green approach.

Green synthesis of CDs has received much
attention, which eases
the labor, reduces both the cost and time, and produces environmentally
benign material with good quantum yield (QY).6 The carbohydrates in natural products composed of C, O, and H elements
support the production of CDs with high abundant surface functional
groups. The oxygen-related surface functional groups of CDs can enhance
water solubility and FL properties. So, natural products as the ideal
carbon precursors differ in chemical compositions with large abundant
heteroatoms. The use of toxic materials and harsh reaction conditions
can be eliminated by using natural carbon precursors. Recently, several
reports showed the successful green synthesis of CDs with excellent
solubility in water or organic solvents and strong FL properties by
hydrothermal treatment from many available natural products, such
as rose heart radish,7 citrus peels,8 tribute chrysanthemum,9 mangosteen,10 and many others. Although
the use of natural carbon precursors is an effective way to synthesize
CDs, a new natural carbon precursor is still challenging to explore
with satisfactory physicochemical and optical properties. Therefore,
the exploration of natural carbon precursors and the expansion of
their applications are highly desirable and still a hot topic. The
development of simple and cheap methods to synthesize CDs is also
highly desirable.

Heavy metal ions are one of the most hazardous
pollutants that
cause alarming environmental and health concerns.11 To date, one of the major concerns is the presence of heavy
metal ions particularly in aquatic systems.12 Fe3+ ions are one of the most plentiful metal ions in
the human body and in the environments. The excess of iron causes
severe problems, such as liver damage, kidney failure, or even death.13 In this regard, developing effective analytical
methods for the detection of Fe3+ ions or other metal ions
is very important and becomes a hot topic among researchers. Then,
the FL quenching efficiency is one of the promising approaches for
the detection of metal ions.

Recently, CDs as the FL sensor
are widely applied. The corresponding
applications have been explored with the preparation of CDs derived
from natural products. The specific application of CDs is attributed
to the different natural carbon precursors with various chemical structures.
As a result, there are many efforts to develop FL sensors for Fe3+ ions. The efforts are still made to the detailed sensing
mechanism, even though CDs with sensing abilities have been informed
continuously. Cranberry bean (CB), one of the natural products, is
a variety of common beans of the worldwide agricultural product with
high yield production and commercially available in traditional and
modern markets with cheap price. CB was used as a carbon precursor
because CB contains a large abundance of carbohydrates, proteins,
fibers, vitamins, sugars, and amino acids.14,15 Different kinds of beans contain different amounts of carbohydrates
and proteins. For example, asparagus beans, peas, lentils, soybeans,
cranberry beans, and chickpeas contain 8, 14, 20, 30, 60, and 61 g
of carbohydrates and 2.8, 5, 9, 36, 23, and 19 g of proteins in 100
g of beans, respectively.16 Compared with
the mentioned beans, CBs contain a higher amount of carbohydrates
(60 g) and proteins (23 g) with a total of 83 g for both biomolecules.
So, CB was chosen for the first time as a new and cheap carbon precursor
to synthesize CDs by the hydrothermal treatment method without functionalization
and modification. The nanostructure and functional groups of the CB-CDs
were analyzed. The emission bands of the CB-CDs shifting with the
change of excitation wavelength were observed. The CB-CDs started
as a good FL sensor for the Fe3+ ion detection among other
metal ions.

Results and Discussion
Synthetic Conditions of CB-CDs
The
CB-CDs were easily
prepared by the hydrothermal treatment method for the detection of
Fe3+ ions through FL quenching efficiency, as demonstrated
in Figure 1. The hydrothermal
treatment is the most widely used method to synthesize CDs because
of its comfort and simple operation without any extra chemicals or
equipment.17 In a hydrothermal system,
the biomolecules in the natural carbon precursors converting into
CDs may go through the process of dehydration, polymerization, and
carbonization.18 After 18 h of heating
time duration at 200 °C of temperature, the solution appeared
in brown color, denoting the formation of CB-CDs. The CB-CDs were
then irradiated under day-light and UV-light, respectively. Under
day-light irradiation, the CB-CD solution appeared as a light-brown
transparent liquid while under UV-light irradiation at a long wavelength
(365 nm), the CB-CDs showed a bright blue color. Because of good FL
properties, the CB-CDs were used for the Fe3+ ion detection.

Figure 1 Schematic
representation of CB-CDs’ formation and application.

The FL properties of CB-CDs were totally affected
by the synthetic
conditions. To achieve a high quality of CB-CDs, different synthetic
conditions, including hydrothermal time duration, hydrothermal temperature,
and CB powder weight, were evaluated by taking the FL spectrum of
CB-CDs as the parameter. The hydrothermal time duration and temperature
have valuable influences on the FL properties of CB-CDs.19 The CB-CDs showed strongest FL intensity with
the increase of hydrothermal time duration and temperature (Figure S1A,B). The optimum FL intensity was reached
with 18 h time duration, 200 °C temperature, and 1.0 g of CB
powder. The prolongation of time duration and the increase in temperature
can produce more carbon nuclei and cause an increase of FL intensity.
A short time duration and low temperature may lead to low reaction
efficiency and inadequate precursor carbonization, thus causing low
FL properties.17

In addition, the
CB powder weight dissolved in ultrapure water
was also evaluated (Figure S1C). The FL
intensity of the CB-CDs was low with a lower CB powder weight (0.25
g), and then the intensity increased when CB powder weight was increased
to 1.5 g. This result may be due to a slow reaction rate of chemical
constituents containing less amount of CB powder.20 The FL intensities of 1.0 and 1.5 g of CB powder were not
significantly changed, and then the CB powder was fixed at 1.0 g for
the synthesis. So, the optimized hydrothermal conditions were 1.0
g of CB powder in 25 mL of H2O with 200 °C temperature
for 18 h of reaction time. After evaluation of optimized conditions,
the reproducibility of the synthetic conditions was repeated three
times (Figure S1D). The result showed that
the FL intensity of CB-CDs with the same synthetic conditions gave
a similar FL character with good reproducibility and precision [relative
standard deviations (RSDs) = 1.16%].

Physicochemical Properties
of CB-CDs
The transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution (HR)-TEM images of CB-CDs
have been captured to characterize their nanostructure morphology
and size. The TEM image shows that CB-CDs marked by yellow circles
display well monodisperse nanoparticles across the whole section of
uniform spherical shapes and are well separated from each other without
apparent aggregation (Figure 2A). In the HR-TEM image, the lattice fringes were obviously
viewed and the d-spacing value was ∼0.21 nm
in the presence of the (100) lattice plane of graphitic carbon, indicating
the graphitic nature of the CB-CDs (inset of Figure 2A).21 The size
distribution of CB-CDs was overall small, ranging from 1.23 to 6.63
nm, as shown in the histogram (Figure 2B). The average size of CB-CDs was 3.96 nm. The Raman
spectrum of the CB-CDs was measured to differentiate between sp2-hybridized carbon and sp3-hybridized carbon atoms.
The spectrum shows two different bands at 1350 and 1544 cm–1, which could be associated with the D and G bands, respectively
(Figure 3A). The D
band comes from the disordered sp3-hybridized carbon atom,
and the G band comes from E2g vibration mode of the sp2-hybridized carbon atom, which indicates the graphitized nature
of CB-CDs.22 Furthermore, the Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was applied to estimate the insights
of surface functional groups of the CB-CDs. As shown in Figure 3B, FT-IR spectra exhibited
the bands of O–H bending and stretching vibrations at 737 and
3384 cm–1, respectively.2,7 Besides,
the bands of C–H stretching vibrations appeared at 2963 cm–1.23 The bands of C–H
bending vibrations appeared at around 604–895, 946, and 1456
cm–1.24−26 The band of C–O stretching
vibrations were observed at 1075 cm–1.27 Then, the bands of C=C and C=O
stretching vibrations were found at 1597 and 1671/1766 cm–1, respectively.20,28 The band at 1297 cm–1 was attributed to O–H in-plane bending vibrations.26 In addition, the band of symmetric stretching
vibrations of −COOH were observed at 1408 cm–1.7 The existence of hydroxyl, carboxyl,
and carbonyl surface groups of CB-CDs give great solubility and stability
in aqueous systems.

Optical Properties of CB-CDs
The UV–vis spectra
were carried out to investigate the optical properties of CB-CDs,
which exhibited a wide absorption band from 220 to 380 nm and a tail
extended to the visible region (Figure 4A). The little sharp absorption peak around 260–280
nm was originated from π–π* energy transition of
the conjugated C=C bonds, confirming the existence of the aromatic
π-system in the core of CDs.29 While,
a peak at 300–380 nm was related to n−π* energy
transition of C=O bonds.29 This
peak yields strong FL emission because of the excited state energy
trapping by the surface states.30 Absorption
spectra of CB-CDs at various dilution factors are given in Figure 4B. The dilution factors
significantly shifted the absorbance spectrum. At high dilution, two
distinctive absorbance peaks were observed at 225 and 275 nm specifically,
whereas at low dilution, the dominant absorbance peak from 260 to
280 nm and the shoulder peak from 300 to 380 nm were observed. The
peak at 225 nm was originated from the σ–σ* energy
transition.31 So, σ–σ*,
n−π*, and π–π* energy transitions
can be seen clearly with different dilution factors.

of CB-CDs and (B) UV–vis spectra
of CB-CD solutions (9-fold) with different dilution factors.

To further characterize optical properties, FL
spectra of the CB-CDs
were investigated. Figure 5A shows the intense peak in the FL excitation and emission
spectra. The FL spectra exhibited the optimum excitation wavelength
at 380 nm (black line) and the optimum emission wavelength at 450
nm (red line). The FL emission intensity depends on the surface nature
and the most particle numbers of CB-CDs were excited at 380 nm. Figure 5B depicts the FL
spectra of CB-CDs at various excitation wavelengths. The spectra clearly
indicated the unique excitation-dependent emission wavelength character
of CB-CDs, which is similar to that of the common FL carbon nanomaterials.
The FL spectra showing the characteristic emission peaks are clearly
red-shifted from 410 nm (black line) to 540 nm (blue line) with the
excitation wavelength from 300 to 500 nm with 20 nm increment. The
FL emission intensity first increased and then decreased. The intensity
gradually increased from 410 to 450 nm with the excitation from 300
to 380 nm and then decreased from 470 to 540 nm with the excitation
from 400 to 500 nm. These findings indicate that the emission peaks
are dependent on the excitation wavelength. The normalized FL spectra
were utilized to observe clearly the red-shift character of emission
peaks with various excitation wavelengths (Figure 5C). Several possible FL origins of CDs are
proposed, including surface state (degree of surface oxidation and
functional groups), quantum confinement effect, the synergistic effect
of the surface state, and molecular fluorescence.32

normalized FL spectra of CB-CDs at various excitation wavelengths
from 300 to 500 nm with a 20 nm increase.

In addition, the CB-CDs’ quantum yield was calculated by
performing measurement at 380 nm of excitation wavelength and the
quantum yield was approximately 10.85%. The FL spectral results strongly
suggest that the CB-CDs exhibit a good quantum yield with strong FL
properties. Table 1 shows the excitation wavelength and quantum yield comparisons of
several CDs derived from several natural carbon precursors. The CB-CDs
have high quantum yield compared with the other reported CDs.27,33−38

FL Stability of CB-CDs
The FL stability of CB-CD solution
was assessed by comparing their FL intensities with various experimental
conditions. Figure S2A shows that the FL
emission intensity was almost constant and did not display any significant
change even after continuous light irradiation for 1 h. It was noticed
that the photobleaching and coagulation were not observed in the solution
after irradiating with the light. The photobleaching-resistant property
is possibly owing to the electrostatic repulsions between the negatively
charged nanoparticles.39 This result shows
that the CB-CDs have good photostability. Moreover, the ionic strength
effect on the FL intensity of CB-CDs was measured by adding various
concentrations of NaCl solution (Figure S2B). The FL intensity remains constant and almost unchanged on increasing
the concentrations of the NaCl from 50 to 1000 mM. This result indicates
that the aggregation of the CB-CDs can be effectively controlled by
the NaCl ionic strengths and also individually separate CB-CDs under
salt interference.40 The CB-CD solution
reveals a long-term homogeneous phase without any obvious precipitation.41 The possible reason is that there was almost
no ionization of surface functional groups of CB-CDs.42 The ionic strength effect on the FL intensity described
that these CB-CDs can be applied to the extremely concentrated salt
environments due to their stable FL character at higher salt concentration.

Furthermore, thermal stability was tested by heating the CB-CD
solution from 30 to 100 °C. As shown in Figure S2C, even after heating for 100 °C, no significant decrease
in the FL intensity was observed. Higher temperature cannot induce
the permanent destruction of the surface chemical structure of CB-CDs,
indicating their high thermal stability and the minimal nonradiative
recombination centers or defects.43,44 The oxygen-rich
groups effectively control the aggregation at a higher temperature
and protect the CB-CDs from degradation induced by thermal oxidation.43 In addition, the same observation was performed
when the sample was kept for 10 days at room temperature. The FL intensity
remained unchanged, which suggests that CB-CDs show excellent photostability
even with a long time of storage at room temperature (Figure S2D). The CB-CD solution exhibits a long-term
homogeneous phase without any floater and apparent precipitation.
So, the FL character is independent of light irradiation, ionic strength,
heat, and storage time. These findings reveal that the CB-CDs have
great potency for valuable applications and commercial purpose since
the FL intensity is still high and remains fairly constant under various
conditions.

The effect of CB-CD solution pH ranging from 3 to
10 on the FL
emission intensity was also evaluated (Figure S2E). The pH value of the solution was fitted by adding 0.1
M HCl and NaOH. A pH of 3 caused a small decrease in the FL emission
intensity. Afterward, the highest intensity was observed at pH 4 and
5. The intensity increased when the pH value was increased from 3
to 5 and then decreased dramatically on changing the pH from 6 to
10. This behavior may be related to the different degrees of deprotonation
of CB-CDs at different pH values.45 The
degree of deprotonation gradually increases when the pH value decreases,
generating in a higher net surface charge which provides the CB-CDs
with hydrophilic and dispersible properties in the water, and accordingly
increasing the FL properties. Particularly, the increasing rate of
intensity slows down with decreasing pH values from 5 to 3, probably
because the protonation of CB-CDs tend to be saturated in a strong
acid environment.9 This result indicates
that the CB-CDs are very sensitive and pH-dependent to acidic and
basic conditions. The CB-CDs show a good FL behavior in acidic environments
while a comparatively low FL character in alkaline and neutral conditions.
It is shown that the pH 4 and 5 were the best pH values for the sensing
system. Due to the real pH value of CB-CDs (5.10), there is no need
to adjust the pH value of the CB-CD solution for sensing metal ions
that possess excellent FL properties in the weakly acidic environment.

Selectivity of CB-CDs toward Metal Ions
CB-CDs as the
FL sensor for the metal ion detection according to the interaction
between the surface functional groups of CB-CDs and metal ions that
can form a complex have been studied. Accordingly, FL emission intensity
of CB-CDs in the existence of various metal ions, such as Zn2+, Ca2+, Na+, K+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, Sn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+, was carried out to evaluate their sensing capability for the selectivity
of metal ions. The changes in the FL emission intensity (F/F0) at 450 nm occurred with the representative
metal ions under the same conditions at a concentration of 500 μM
after incubation for 2 min (Figure 6A). F and F0 are the FL intensity of CB-CDs with and without metal ions. These
metal ions possessed different influences on the FL behavior of CB-CDs.
The histogram was plotted by using F/F0 versus the similar concentration of metal ions (Figure 6B). The sensing potency
was evaluated by monitoring the initial FL intensity of CB-CDs for
significant changes once added with various metal ions. Notably, only
Fe3+ ions caused a significant and strong FL intensity
quenching compared with the other metal ions. The FL intensity was
quenched up to 51% in the existence of 500 μM Fe3+ ions, while other metal ions exhibited either slight or no alteration
in FL intensity with negligible effects. A slight quenching of about
15% observed in the case of Cu2+ ions that could be assigned
to possible CD/Cu2+ complex formation, however, was not
significant. This result clearly indicates that CB-CDs could be employed
as a very specific, efficient, and selective FL sensor toward Fe3+ ions due to the stronger affinity.

Figure 6 (A) FL emission spectra
of CB-CD solutions in the addition of various
metal ions, (B) relative FL intensities (F/F0) of CB-CD solutions without and with various
metal ions (excitation wavelength = 380 nm; concentration = 500 μM),
(C) FL emission spectra of CB-CD solutions in the addition of Fe3+ ions (500 μM) with real pH after addition (4.11) and
adjusted pH at 5.10, and (D) CB-CD solutions with different metal
ions with the concentration of 500 μM under UV light irradiation.

Furthermore, the pH values of CB-CD solution after
adding various
metal ions were measured. The pH of the solutions were slightly changed
to various pH values (Zn2+ = 5.06, Ca2+ = 5.06,
Na+ = 5.11, K+ = 5.12, Cd2+ = 4.78,
Ni2+ = 5.05, Co2+ = 5.05, Pb2+ =
4.75, Hg2+ = 4.97, Sn2+ = 4.27, Fe2+ = 4.95, Cu2+ = 4.91, and Fe3+ = 4.11). The
pH changes of the solutions were still around 5.10 of the real pH
of CB-CDs. Although CB-CDs on being added with some metal ions, such
as Cd2+, Pb2+, Sn2+, and Fe3+, have lower pH values than other metal ions, the FL intensities
of CB-CDs/metal ions with their real pH and adjusted pH to 5.10 did
not change. As an example, the FL intensities of CB-CDs/Fe3+ ions with the pH 4.11 (red line) and pH 5.10 (black line) were maintained
stable without any changes (Figure 6C). So, these pH values had no effect on the FL intensity
quenching due to the pH values of all solutions were still being in
the best pH range (4–5) of the CB-CD solution (Figure S2E). In addition, a photograph of the
CB-CD solutions with the addition of various metal ions (500 μM)
under UV light irradiation is presented in Figure 6D. The result shows that the CB-CD solutions
with the addition of all metal ions exhibited a FL bright blue color
under UV light irradiation except for Fe3+ ions. The CB-CD/Fe3+ complex solution dimmed the bright blue color. This result
clearly indicates that this sensing system is very selective to Fe3+ ions.

Sensitivity of CB-CDs toward Fe3+ Ions
The
reaction time effect on the interaction between CB-CDs and Fe3+ ions was first investigated to monitor FL quenching efficiency
(Figure 7A). It can
be seen that the completion of the reaction between CB-CDs and Fe3+ ions was fast and completed within 1 min of mixing time
and 2 min of incubation time. To assess the sensitivity for quantitative
detection of Fe3+ ions, CB-CD solution added with various
concentrations of Fe3+ ions (30–600 μM) was
investigated by recording the FL emission spectra. The CB-CDs without
adding Fe3+ ions displayed strong FL emission intensity
at 450 nm upon excitation at 380 nm. The intensity was quenched progressively
above 50% of its initial value with the increasing concentration of
Fe3+ ions (Figure 7B), expressing that this FL sensor is very sensitive toward
various concentrations of Fe3+ ions, which can easily and
effectively interact with CB-CDs. The plot of F/F0 and the concentrations of Fe3+ ions
ranging from 30 to 600 μM exhibited good linearity with the
correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.99663
(Figure 7C). It can
be seen that the increase in Fe3+ concentration is in accordance
with the decrease in FL emission intensity of CB-CDs. The detection
limit of Fe3+ ions was 9.55 μM (S/N = 3) and confirmed
that CB-CDs are sensitive enough to detect Fe3+ ions. The
Fe3+ ion sensing properties of the other CDs as the FL
sensors are summarized in Table 2. The results denote that the developed method exhibits
good selective and sensitive detection of Fe3+ ions compared
with the other reported methods.28,45−50 The developed method had benefits in terms of a low detection limit
and broad linear range.

Figure 7D shows
the FL excitation features of the CB-CDs/Fe3+ system. The
FL emission spectra can be obtained by both downconversion and upconversion
associated to the excitation of high-energy photons and multiphotons
of lower energy, respectively.51 Interestingly,
the FL excitation intensity of CB-CDs at 760 nm increased gradually
on increasing the concentration of Fe3+ ions. This excitation
wavelength exhibits relatively weaker or no emission at the shorter
wavelengths due to the absorption of two or more photons supporting
the electron transition from ground state to excited state.52 Considering much higher FL emission intensity,
the FL emission feature from the excitation of 380 nm is a more preferential
FL sensing platform for Fe3+ ions. Even so, the FL excitation
peak at the longer wavelength showed another characteristic behavior
and evidence of the complex interaction of CB-CDs and Fe3+ ions. Furthermore, FL excitation features of the CB-CDs/Fe3+ complex were measured by using prescan mode to specify the energy-transfer
mechanism between CB-CDs and Fe3+ ions. For the FL excitation
of CB-CDs, there are two appreciable characteristic excitation peaks
located at 380 and 650 nm. Figure 8A shows that the FL excitation peak at 650 nm was increased
dramatically after adding Fe3+ ions. The normalized peak
shows clearly the increased peak intensity at 650 nm, while the peak
at 380 nm was decreased with increasing Fe3+ ions (inset
of Figure 8A). The
FL excitation spectral shapes of CB-CDs with lower concentrations
of Fe3+ ions are in relation to the characteristics of
CB-CDs, while higher concentrations of Fe3+ ions show an
attractive change in the excitation band’s shape. The FL excitation
spectra showed the bands with higher intensity at 650 nm, which is
attributed to the absorption transition of 3d5 electrons
of Fe3+ ions from the ground state to the excited state.

excitation spectra and (B) UV–vis spectra of CB-CDs
in the presence of Fe3+ ions in the concentration range

The UV–vis absorption spectra of CB-CDs after addition with
various concentrations of Fe3+ ions were also investigated
(Figure 8B). The absorbance
at the shoulder peak (300–500 nm) was gradually hyperchromic
shifted with the increase of Fe3+ concentration, which
can be described by the smaller enlargement of CB-CDs at higher Fe3+ concentration due to the additive absorbance nature of Fe3+ ions at ∼370 nm.53 The
growth of the apparent absorbance was significantly higher and started
to reach longer wavelengths in the range of 300–500 nm shoulder
peak. Inset of Figure 8B shows clearly the distinction of UV–vis absorption spectra
between CB-CD solution and the solution after addition of 500 μM
Fe3+ ions.

Determination of Fe3+ Ions in
Real Water Samples
To investigate the significance and application
in real water samples,
this FL sensor was applied to determine the Fe3+ ions in
underground and tap water samples. Observing in the FL emission spectra,
no Fe3+ ions were found in the water samples. Accordingly,
the technique of standard addition was performed. Various concentrations
of Fe3+ ions were added to the underground and tap water
samples, and the proposed FL responses were recorded. The measurement
was repeated three times, and the average analysis was presented with
the relative standard deviations (RSDs). Clearly, the FL emission
intensity of the CB-CDs quenched when various concentrations of Fe3+ standard solution were spiked to all real water samples,
as illustrated in Table 3. The recovery ranges were between 93.24 and 100.32% for underground
water and between 92.42 and 99.27% for tap water. The low RSDs ranged
from 0.53 to 1.26% for underground water and from 0.15 to 1.78% for
tap water, verifying that this method has good accuracy and precision.
These results indicate that CB-CDs can detect Fe3+ ions
in the real samples.

Possible FL Quenching Mechanisms
The relatively high
selectivity of the CB-CDs toward Fe3+ ions over other metal
ions was attributed to the half-filled 3d orbital of Fe3+ and the unique interaction of Fe3+ ions. Fe3+ ions display the strongest FL quenching effect on CB-CDs, attributing
to greater affinity and effective/quick coordination/chelation kinetics
between the Fe3+ ions and the abundant hydroxyl (−OH)
and/or carboxyl (−COOH) groups on the surface of CB-CDs, which
facilitates the complex formation.53,54 The possible
mechanisms for FL quenching of CB-CDs by Fe3+ ions was
provided as illustrated in Figure 9A. The abundant electrons of CB-CDs in the excited
state transfer to the half-filled 3d orbital of Fe3+ ions
and lead to nonradiative electron–hole recombination due to
this coordination interaction, which results in the FL quenching.7 The existence of abundant hydroxyl and carboxyl
groups was ensured by the FT-IR spectrum. The FT-IR spectral characteristics
of CB-CDs were completely changed with the addition of Fe3+ ions, suggesting the formation of CB-CDs/Fe3+ complex
chelate (Figure S3). An extensive decrease
in the intensity for the peaks at 1408 and 1297 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectrum confirms the possible binding of Fe3+ to the −COOH and −OH groups of the CB-CDs. Compared
with the FT-IR spectrum of CB-CDs, CB-CDs/Fe3+ complex
weakened the absorbance of C–H, C=O, C=C, and
C–O bonds, indicating that the chemical bonds on the surface
of CB-CDs change because of the high affinity between Fe3+ ions and oxygen-containing functional groups from the CB-CDs. As
mentioned above, the FL intensity quenching may be due to the formation
of ferric-hydroxyl or ferric-carboxyl complexes at the surface of
CB-CDs.

Figure 9 (A) Illustration of the possible FL intensity quenching mechanism
of the CB-CDs in the addition of Fe3+ ions and (B) the
formed brown color aggregation of the CB-CDs/Fe3+ system.

Furthermore, the monodisperse CB-CDs became the
aggregated CB-CDs
by the addition of Fe3+ ions (Figure 9B). The quenching in FL intensity may also
be attributed to the aggregation of the CB-CDs.55 The aggregation of CB-CD solution after adding Fe3+ ions clearly appeared in the brown precipitation form in the bottom
of the tube (red circle) after 2 h of incubation. The complex formation
via coordination between the surface of CB-CDs and Fe3+ ions joins adjacent CB-CDs together to form the aggregation of CB-CD
solution.56 The sizes of CB-CDs increased
dramatically in the existence of Fe3+ ions, which leads
to the aggregation of the CB-CD solution.10

Conclusions
In this study, a cheap, simple, and green
method for the synthesis
of CDs by the hydrothermal treatment derived from the CB as a new
natural carbon precursor with ultrapure water without using any toxic
chemicals, any surface passivation agents, and complex equipment was
successfully developed. The optimized synthetic conditions were 200
°C temperature, 18 h time duration, and 1.0 g of CB powder weight.
Under optimized conditions, the CB-CDs are of a spherical shape with
3.96 nm of the average size. The −OH and −COOH surface
functional groups improve water solubility and FL properties of CB-CDs.
The CB-CDs exhibited a strong FL bright blue color under UV light
irradiation and FL emission, which is dependent on the excitation
wavelength. The CB-CDs are dependent on pH values and possessed good
stability to several effects, including light irradiation, ionic strength,
heat, and storage time. The FL intensity of CB-CDs was prominently
quenched in the existence of Fe3+ ions. The CB-CDs can
be utilized as the FL sensor for the selective and sensitive detection
of Fe3+ ions. The FL quenching efficiency of CB-CDs after
adding Fe3+ ions ranging from 30 to 600 μM showed
good linearity with the detection limit of 9.55 μM. The CB-CDs
possess specific binding,
high selectivity, and good sensitivity toward Fe3+ ions,
thus leading to aggregations that quench their FL intensity. Therefore,
CB-CDs can be utilized as an environmentally friendly nanomaterial
in the future sensing application for saving environments and other
important applications, such as biosensing, bioimaging, drug delivery,
and catalysis.

Experimental Section
Materials and Chemicals
CB as a carbon precursor was
purchased from a traditional market in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. ZnCl2, NiCl2·6H2O, SnCl2·2H2O, KCl, NaCl, CuCl2·2H2O, CaCl2·2H2O, and NaOH were purchased from Showa
Chemical Co. Ltd. FeCl2·4H2O, HgCl2, CoCl2·6H2O, CdCl2·xH2O, and quinine were purchased from Alfa Aesar.
FeCl3 was obtained from Shimakyu’s Pure Chemicals.
PbCl2 was bought from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrochloric acid
and sulfuric acid were obtained from J.T. Baker and Honeywell Research
Chemicals, respectively. Ultrapure water from Simplicity Millipore
water purification system (∼18.2 Ω, 25 °C) was used
as a solvent in this study.

Synthesis of CB-CDs
The CB-CDs were
prepared by hydrothermal
treatment. In a typical procedure, CB seeds were first washed with
ultrapure water and desiccated in the precision oven for 5 h at 100
°C. Then, the dried CB seeds were crushed into powder. One gram
of CB powder was placed into a Teflon-lined autoclave hydrothermal
system containing 25 mL H2O and heated for 18 h at 200
°C. After the treatment process, the solution was allowed to
cool naturally to room temperature. The solution was then separated
from large residue particles with a Whatman filter paper. The centrifugation
at 9000 rpm for 30 min followed by 0.22 μM membrane filter was
used to eliminate the remaining solid residues from the solution.
Finally, the CB-CD solution was kept at 4 °C for further use.
To optimize the synthetic conditions, different temperatures (120,
140, 160, 180, and 200 °C), heating time durations (6, 12, 18,
and 24 h), and CB powder weights (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g) were
evaluated.

Instrumentation
The channel precision
oven was used
for hydrothermal heating treatment. The FL absorption color of CB-CDs
was checked by using UV light irradiation with a long excitation wavelength
at 365 nm (Analytik Jena UVP UVGL-25). The FL spectra were recorded
by using FL spectroscopy (Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer).
FT-IR spectrum was obtained by using FT-IR spectroscopy (ALPHA FT-IR
Spectrometer from Bruker). The absorption spectra were recorded by
UV–vis spectroscopy (Spectra Academy UV–Vis Spectrometer
Detector SV-2100). The TEM images were scanned by a Hitachi HT-7700
microscope and JEM-3010 HR-TEM (JEOL, Japan). The Raman spectrum was
recorded on a Micro Raman Identify Spectrometer (ProTrusTech Co. Ltd.).

Quantum Yield Calculation
The CB-CDs’ quantum
yield was examined based on an established procedure. Briefly, CB-CDs
were diluted with ultrapure water (η = 1.33), and quinine solution
as a standard was diluted in 0.1 M H2SO4 (QY
= 54%, η = 1.33). The absorbance and FL spectra were recorded
at 380 nm. The absorbance value of CB-CDs and quinine solution was
maintained in a 1 cm quartz cuvette at 0.05. The integrated FL intensity
obtained for the sample as a function of absorbance was compared to
that of quinine using the equation: QYx = QYy(Ay/Ax)(Ix/Iy)(ηx2/ηy2) where “QY”
is the quantum yield, “A” is the absorbance
at 380 nm, “I” is the integrated FL
intensity, “η” is the solvent refraction index,
“x” refers to CB-CDs, and “y” refers to quinine.

Fluorescence Sensing of
Fe3+ Ions
To examine
the selectivity for the metal ions, 100 μL of CB-CD solution
was diluted into 900 μL of ultrapure water (9-folds). Several
metal ions (Ca2+, Zn2+, Na+, K+, Ni+, Co2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, Sn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+) were added separately into the CB-CD
solution to the concentration of 500 μM. The mixtures were mixed
with the vortex mixer for 1 min and incubated for 2 min under room
temperature. The FL emission spectra with excitation wavelength at
380 nm were recorded to check the specific metal ions that can quench
the FL intensity. To examine the sensitivity of Fe3+ ions,
various concentrations of Fe3+ ions (30–600 μM)
were added into the CB-CD solution. FL spectra with excitation at
380 nm were recorded and their FL quenching efficiency compared.

Sensing of Fe3+ Ions in Real Water Samples
The
application of this sensing method for Fe3+ ion detection
was also examined to verify the utilization of CB-CDs as the FL sensor
for real water samples, such as underground and tap water samples.
These water samples were used without further filtrations. These water
samples (500 μL) were spiked with the Fe3+ standard
solution and mixed with CB-CD solution to a final Fe3+ concentration
of 30–200 μM. The samples were then measured, and the
resultant FL spectra were recorded. The recoveries were counted by
an equation: R = [(Cz – Cy)/Cx] × 100%, where “R” is the recovery
percentage, “Cx” is Fe3+ concentration added into the water samples, “Cy” is Fe3+ concentration in
the water samples before the addition of the standard Fe3+ ions, and “Cz” is Fe3+ concentration in water samples after the addition of the
standard Fe3+ ions.7
