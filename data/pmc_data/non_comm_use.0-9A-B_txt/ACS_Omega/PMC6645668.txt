A nanocomposite
of polyaniline with graphitic carbon nitride (GCN)
nanosheets has been synthesized by a facile oxidative polymerization
of an aniline monomer and GCN to demonstrate its potential to catalyze
the synthesis of various indole-substituted 4H-chromenes.
The synthesized nanocomposite was thoroughly characterized using different
spectroscopic techniques to confirm the morphology and composition.
Subsequently, the fabricated nanocomposite was used as a heterogeneous
catalyst to synthesize several bioactive indole-substituted 4H-chromenes in an aqueous medium. Organic transformation
under benign and environmentally sustainable conditions is of paramount
importance in the view of growing environmental pollution. Water is
the universal Green solvent and has been a preferred choice of nature
to perform various reactions. The catalyst developed in this work
showed very good recyclability and adaptability for the synthesis
of various medicinally significant indole-substituted 4H-chromenes. This multicomponent reaction imparts very high atom economy
(94%) and low environmental factor (0.13).

Introduction
Over the past few decades,
the upswing in fascination for developing
valuable nanomaterials has aroused widespread interest in the scientific
community to develop a number of novel porous materials such as porous
organic polymers,1,2 zeolites,3,4 and
activated carbon.5,6 Metal-free porous organic polymers
have captivated significant attention because of their easy synthetic
approach, relatively lightweight, tunable skeleton, high specific
surface areas, and thermal stability.7−9 These properties make
porous organic materials ideal for promising applications in various
fields, such as catalysis, gas storage, and gas separation.1,10−13 These emerging materials can be considered as analogous to other
different porous inorganic materials, like metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs) or zeolites, due to the possible similarity in terms of pore
size and pore volume.8,14,15 These materials can be synthesized by various organic reactions
via different monomer building blocks, which impart flexibility to
the material to obtain desirable porosity and other properties. Porous
materials render a large active surface area and porosity for catalytic
processes.16,17 Recently, porous conjugated polymers
have been synthesized and employed as stable heterogeneous catalysts
for various organic transformations.1,18,19 Various kinds of organic polymers with high surface
area and high physical and chemical stabilities have been developed,
such as styrene-type polymers, polypyrrole, polyaniline (PANI), and
various other covalent organic frameworks.20−23 Porous organic polymers have
also been synthesized by trimerization of ethynyl group, via imide,
amide, or imine formation.24,25 Similarly other materials
have been synthesized using nitrile functionality via click reaction
or oxidative polymerization.1,7

Conducting polymers
have been perceived as a potential area of
research and possible materials for various technological applications
over the past few decades. These polymers have gained significant
recognition as functional materials due to their very high π-conjugated
length, distinctive electrical properties, and innocuous chemical
and electrochemical properties. Among the various conducting polymers,
polyaniline (PANI) has garnered noteworthy attention over the past
few decades.26,27 PANI unveils several potential
research applications, such as molecular sensors, rechargeable batteries,
supercapacitors, light-emitting diodes, electrorheological materials,
gas separation devices, etc.28−34 PANI is an environmentally and thermally stable material that makes
it comparatively congenial to handle and when doped with a Brønsted
acid imparts metallic conduction. Both soft and hard templates have
been used to synthesize PANI nanostructures.22,35 Nanostructures of PANI are of prevalent on-going research interest
due to the combination of their low-dimensional organic conduction
and high surface area. This state can assist in enhancing the properties
for catalytic applications. Various PANI nanostructures can be obtained
by inserting structure-directing agents into chemical polymerization.
PANI nanofibers and nanosheets are preferred over many noble metals
because these can be easily prepared with high surface area, high
surface-to-volume ratio, and large pore volume. Moreover, the amine
nitrogen linkage in polyaniline enables efficacious binding of reactants
at active sites during the reactions. Besides this, polyaniline differs
from other polymeric materials on account of its good flexibility
and fast charge-separation potential because of its p-orbital structure.
PANI is nontoxic and biocompatible, that make it a suitable material
for biological and chemical sensors and actuators and also various
other microelectronic devices.36−39

Several composites comprising PANI and other
semiconductor materials
have been synthesized and evidenced relatively higher catalytic activity
for pollutant degradation.40,41 The PANI–TiO2 composite was found to be efficient for degradation of acetone.42 The CuI–PANI composite was found to be
a superhydrophobic material with excellent photocatalytic activity.43 Moreover, the composites such as PANI–BiVO4 and PANI–CdS have also been synthesized and efficient
photocatalytic activity has been reported for these composites.44,45 Therefore, we anticipated that a combination of a carbon-based semiconductor,
graphitic carbon nitride (GCN), and PANI will be ideal for various
heterogeneous catalytic processes. Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN)
has also received significant attention recently due to its distinctive
structure and characteristics such as good thermal and chemical stability
and mild basic character due to nitrogen richness.46,47 All of these properties make GCN a suitable material for various
applications such as a catalyst or catalytic support material for
various organic transformation reactions.48,49 Both PANI and GCN are environmentally and thermally stable; hence,
by using a suitable doping agent, the PANI–GCN (PGCN) nanocomposite
can impart desired properties, which can be potentially used for catalytic
applications. Recently, heteroatom-doped carbonaceous materials have
emerged as catalysts for metal-free organic transformations.50,51 Similarly, PANI–GCN can also be employed as a catalyst for
various organic transformation reactions after doping with a heteroatom.
Furthermore, considering the environmental benignity, it is preferable
that the reactions be performed in Green solvents. In this regard,
water being the universal Green solvent is the first choice, as nature
uses it to perform various reactions. In addition, its huge abundance,
large temperature window, low cost, and good hydrogen-bonding ability
make it an ideal solvent for various reactions. In this work, we report
the synthesis of a PANI–GCN (PGCN) nanocomposite and ammonia-doped
PANI–GCN (NPGCN) nanocomposite as efficient heterogeneous catalysts
for the synthesis of indole-substituted 4H-chromenes.
This multicomponent reaction performed in aqueous medium imparts very
high atom economy and significantly low environmental factor. Some
representative examples of bioactive 4H-chromenes
have been presented in Figure 1 below.

Results and Discussion
Material Synthesis and
Characterization
Synthesis of
the polyaniline–graphitic carbon nitride (PGCN) nanocomposite
was performed using an oxidative polymerization method, and fabrication
of the ammonia-doped polyaniline–graphitic carbon nitride (NPGCN)
composite was performed using liquid ammonia, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Schematic diagram for
the synthesis of PGCN and NPGCN.

The phase purity and crystal structure of as-prepared catalysts
were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, and the corresponding
results are presented in Figure 3a,b. It can be seen from Figure 3a that bare polyaniline (PANI) exhibits a
weak diffraction peak at 2θ = 25.0°, which indicates the
amorphous nature of the material.52 In
addition, the absence of sharp diffraction peaks in the bare PANI
signifies its weak crystalline nature. It can be seen that graphitic
carbon nitride (GCN) shows two distinct diffraction peaks at 2θ
= 13.0 and 27.5°, which can be assigned to the (100) and (002)
reflection planes of graphitic materials (Figure 3c). The intense diffraction peak at 2θ
= 27.5° corresponds to the interplanar stacking of aromatic systems,
whereas the small diffraction peak at 2θ = 13.0° corresponds
to the in-planar tri-s-triazine units, which is consistent
with the literature.53 The XRD patterns
of PGCN and NPGCN nanocomposites in Figure 3b exhibit predominantly the diffraction planes
corresponding to GCN, which constitute the main component in these
nanocomposites.

Figure 3 XRD patterns of (a) PANI and (b) GCN, PGCN, and NPGCN
nanocomposites
and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of (c) PANI and (d)
GCN, PGCN, and NPGCN nanocomposites.

The molecular structure and functionality present in the
synthesized
materials were confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy shown in Figure 3c,d. The broad signal at 3250
cm–1 can be assigned to H-bonding vibrations of
the amine and imine moieties of PANI. The bands at 1560 and 1480 cm–1 can be assigned to C=N and C=C of aromatic
systems. The bands at 1300 and 1245 cm–1 can be
assigned to C–N stretching vibrations of the benzenoid unit,
and the band at 1115 cm–1 corresponds to the quinoid
unit of the PANI polymer.52,54 For GCN, the distinct
peaks at 1240 and 1575 cm–1 can be assigned to the
stretching mode of C–N heterocycles. Moreover, the peaks at
800 and 880 cm–1 represent the typical mode of vibration
for a triazine ring.55,56

In the case of the PANI–GCN
nanocomposite, the distinct
peaks of PANI at 1110, 1300, 1480, and 1560 cm–1 shift to higher wave numbers of 1125, 1310, 1489, and 1572 cm–1, respectively, after incorporation of GCN, indicating
the formation of a nanocomposite. In addition, the nanocomposite formation
also results in strengthening of H-bonds in the PANI polymer as evidenced
by the intensification of the peak at 3250 cm–1,
which indicates the successful fabrication of the composite. After
doping with ammonia, the peak at 3250 cm–1 due to
H-bonding vibrations becomes more intense in the case of the NPGCN
nanocomposite, which indicates the successful formation of the nanocomposite.

The morphology of as-prepared PANI, GCN, and NPGCN nanocomposites
was investigated by performing scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. Figure 4 shows SEM micrographs
of bare GCN, bare PANI, PGCN nanocomposite, and NPGCN nanocomposite.
It is evident from the images that bare PANI has some aggregated morphology,
as represented in Figure 4a,b, whereas PGCN and NPCN nanocomposites exhibit porous structures
(Figure 4c–f).
The presence of all constituent elements in the NPGCN nanocomposite
has been confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy
measurements presented in Figure S1a. TEM
images of the materials are presented in Figure 5, which shows the sheetlike wrinkled morphology
for both GCN and PANI (Figure 5a,b). In addition, the TEM images of PGCN and NPGCN nanocomposites
also show two-dimensional morphology with good blending of PANI over
GCN nanosheets to form intimate contact between them. The presence
of all constituent elements in the NPGCN nanocomposite has also been
confirmed by EDAX measurements presented in Figure S1b.

NPGCN nanocomposites.

To investigate the specific surface
area, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) (SBET) gas sorption measurements
were performed with GCN, PGCN, and NPGCN nanocomposites. The nitrogen
(N2) adsorption–desorption isotherms of all catalysts
at 77 K were obtained using the multipoint BET method to measure the
surface area and are presented in Figure 6. Figure 6a–d shows N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms for GCN, PANI, PGCN, and NPGCN nanocomposites, respectively.
It is evident from BET analysis that the surface area of GCN was 16.210
m2 g–1 and that of PANI was 26.099 m2 g–1. The surface area of the PGCN nanocomposite
had an intermediate value of 23.988 m2 g–1, but after doping with ammonia, the surface area got slightly decreased
to 21.982 m2 g–1, which might be due
to filling of the pores of the nanocomposite by ammonia or due to
the change in the chemical nature and structure of PGCN (i.e., emeraldine
HCl salt nanocomposite with GCN) to NPGCN (i.e., emeraldine base nanocomposite
with GCN). The BET-obtained parameters, including specific surface
area, specific pore volume, and averaged pore diameter of all of the
materials, have been summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information).

GCN, (b) PANI, (c) PGCN, and (d) NPGCN nanocomposites.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used
to investigate
the chemical states of different constituent elements present in PGCN
and NPGCN nanocomposites. The survey scan spectrum of PGCN and NPGCN
nanocomposites is presented in Figure S2a,b. The main elements present on the surface of these nanocomposites
are carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). A trace of chloride ions was also
found in the case of PGCN nanocomposites (Figure S2a), which confirms the formation of emeraldine salt in the
PGCN nanocomposite. However, the disappearance of the chloride ions
in the NPGCN nanocomposite, Figure S2b,
reveals the conversion of emeraldine salt to emeraldine base. Figure 7a,b shows the deconvoluted
spectra of C-1s and N-1s of the PGCN nanocomposite, whereas Figure 7c,d shows the deconvoluted
spectra of C-1s and N-1s of the NPGCN nanocomposite. In the case of
PGCN, the C-1s photoelectron signal shows two peaks at 285.2 and 288.2
eV. The XPS peak at 285.2 eV represents the carbon atoms of PANI or
graphitic carbon atom linked to the nitrogen atom of GCN, and the
peak at 288.2 eV represents a carbon atom that is bonded to three
nitrogen atoms (i.e., N(C)3) in GCN. The deconvoluted spectra
of N-1s show that there are three different kinds of nitrogen present
in the nanocomposite at binding energies of 399.0, 400.8, and 404.8
eV, respectively. The peak at 399.0 eV represents the nitrogen atom
bonded to two different carbon atoms (C=N–C), and the
two peaks at 400.8 and 404.8 eV can be assigned to the triazine ring
system (N–(C)3) and amino functional groups (C–N–H),
respectively. In the case of the NPGCN nanocomposite, the deconvoluted
XPS spectra show a similar pattern for C-1s and N-1s signals as in
the case of PGCN. However, there is a slight shift in the peak positions
of C-1s and N-1s, which confirms the change in the electronic environment
of elements in the nanocomposite after doping with ammonia. The relative
elemental composition of the elements presents in these two nanocomposites
has also been obtained by XPS and is given in Table S2 (Supporting Information).

(b) N-1s of PGCN, (c) C-1s of NPGCN, and (d) N-1s of NPGCN.

The thermal stability of GCN,
PANI, PGCN, and NPGCN was analyzed
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the obtained results are presented
in Figure 8. GCN shows
a very less initial weight loss of 12% up to 540 °C, which may
account for the loss of water molecules adsorbed on its surface. However,
after that, there is a sharp loss in weight and 100% weight loss is
observed at 740 °C, which corresponds to the loss of carbon and
nitrogen from the GCN skeleton. PANI was found to be thermally less
stable in comparison with GCN, wherein up to 240 °C, there was
only 10% loss in the initial weight, but after that, a gradual decrease
in the weight of PANI was observed, and complete weight loss was observed
at 700 °C. In the case of the PGCN nanocomposite, the thermal
stability was found to increase and only 7% weight loss was observed
up to 520 °C, followed by complete weight loss at 700 °C.
On the other hand, the NPGCN nanocomposite showed a slight decrease
in thermal stability in comparison with PGCN, which is evident from
the TGA plot. Up to 470 °C, there was only 8% weight loss in
the case of NPGCN, whereas the complete loss in weight was observed
at 680 °C. This analysis confirmed the thermal stability of our
developed nanocomposite catalysts for higher-temperature reactions
as well.

Catalytic Activity Studies
The catalytic activity of
the nanocomposites has been explored for the synthesis of indole-substituted
4H-chromenes by the reaction of salicylaldehyde or
substituted salicylaldehyde, malononitrile, and indole. The catalytic
activity was initially optimized with PGCN and NPGCN nanocomposites
(10 wt %) using a model multicomponent reaction (Scheme 1 and Table 1). Salicylaldehyde, malononitrile, and indole
were reacted in the presence of PGCN. Reactions were performed using
PGCN having 1:1 and 1:2 ratios, but instead of the desired product
(indole-substituted 4H-chromene), we evidenced the
formation of a bisindole product, which is a condensation product
of indole and salicylaldehyde. Hence, it was observed that malononitrile
remained unreacted in the reaction, whereas the other two reactants
formed the product. However, when the same reaction was performed
with the ammonia-doped nanocompsoite (NPGCN), the desired indole-substituted
4H-chromene product was obtained. Hence, we could
observe that the ammonia-doped catalyst (NPGCN) was found to be more
suitable for our model reaction to synthesize indole-substituted 4H-chromenes.

a Optimized reaction
condition: salicylaldehyde
(1.0 mmol), malononitrile (1.0 mmol), indole (1.0 mmol), NPGCN catalyst
(5 wt %), and H2O (2 mL). Reaction was performed at 55
°C temperature.

Reaction
conditions were optimized by varying several parameters,
as shown in Table 1. Initially, the reaction carried out at ambient temperature led
to average yields and required more time for the completion of the
reaction. When the temperature was increased from room temperature
(RT) to 55 °C, significant improvement in the yield of the reaction
could be observed. Several optimization reactions were conducted by
varying both the temperature and the amount of catalyst (Table 1, sl. no. 1–17).
The best-optimized conditions for the model reaction were as follows:
55 °C, 1 h reaction time, and in water medium using 5 wt % catalyst.
There was no significant improvement in the performance of the reaction
upon increasing the quantity of the catalyst further. We also checked
the performance of our reaction using other different Green solvents.
It is evident from Table 1 (sl. no. 14–16) that the reaction proceeded well with
ethanol, isopropanol (IPA), and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as well,
but the efficiency of the reaction in these solvents was found to
be less than that in water under similar conditions. Control experiments
with bare PANI and GCN were also performed to verify the potential
of these constituent materials for the above catalytic reaction (Table 1, sl. no. 11–13),
and the yields obtained were negligible.

To illustrate the diversity
of substrate scope and wide applicability
of the developed catalytic reaction, variously substituted indoles
were examined and reactions were performed (Table 2, 4a–j).
All of the substituted indoles such as 5-chloroindole, 5-bromoindole,
5-methoxyindole, 5-hydroxyindole, 5-nitroindole, 1-methylindole, and
2-methylindole resulted in the formation of indole-substituted 4H-chromenes with good to excellent yields. However, only
7-azaindole was found reluctant for the above-mentioned reaction (refer 4h in Table 2). The possible reason could be that the nitrogen atom present at
the 7-position of the indole molecule withdraws the electron density
from the five-membered-ring nitrogen atom, leading to the inactive
nature of the C3-position of indole and thereby results in the inactivity
of 7-azaindole for this reaction. We also performed reactions of indole
and malononitrile with substituted salicylaldehyde (−F, −Cl,
Br, NO2, −OMe) and found that there was not much
effect on reactivity due to substituent change on the salicylaldehyde
unit. Finally, reactions of indole and salicylaldehyde were performed
with ethyl cyanoacetate or methyl cyanoacetate to examine the change
in reactivity by changing active methylene counterparts in the reactions.
Interestingly, low yields for the reactions were observed when ethyl
or methyl cyanoacetate was used in place of malononitrile in the reaction.

Table 2 Substrate Scope for the Synthesis
of Indole-Substituted 4H-Chromene Derivatives
Table 3 presents
the formation of undesired bisindole products on the reaction of indole,
salicylaldehyde, and malononitrile in the presence of PGCN. It was
observed that PGCN has inherent acidic property, possibly due to PANI–HCl
salt formation, which promotes the bisindole formation (Table 3, 5a–f) in preference to 4H-chromenes. However,
in another case, after doping with ammonia, PGCN becomes NPGCN, which
turns its nature into basic and thereby leads to base-catalyzed synthesis
of indole-substituted 4H-chromenes (Table 2, 4a–t).

Table 3 Substrate Scope for the Synthesis
of Salicylaldehyde-Derived Bisindoylmethane Derivatives
Moreover, after synthesizing
a library of indole-substituted 4H-chromenes by the
reaction of indole, salicylaldehyde,
and malononitrile, we performed some control experiments to understand
the mechanism and change in reactivity by varying the equivalents
of the reactants. Initially, a control experiment was performed in
which 1 equiv of salicylaldehyde was reacted with 1 equiv of malononitrile
(Scheme 2, reaction
a) to form 2-imino-2H-chromene-3-carbonitrile, which
could not be isolated. However, when 2 equiv of malononitrile was
used (Scheme 2, reaction
b) in the reaction with salicylaldehyde, an interesting product 2-(2-amino-3-cyano-4H-chromen-4-yl) malononitrile was formed. However, when
1 equiv of each salicylaldehyde, malononitrile, and indole was used,
the usual indole-substituted 4H-chromene product
was formed (Scheme 2, reaction c). Similarly, we extended the scope of control experiment
to investigate the reaction with another active methylene compound.
Hence, we performed the reaction of 1 equiv of salicylaldehyde with
1 equiv of ethyl cyanoacetate and the product formed was successfully
isolated (Scheme 2,
reaction d), which confirmed the formation of intermediate formed
during the catalytic cycle. Finally, the reaction of 1 equiv of ethyl
cyanoacetate was performed with 1 equiv of each indole and salicylaldehyde,
and the usual 4H-chromene product was formed (Scheme 2, reaction e), which
could also be successfully isolated and characterized.

Scheme 2 Control
Experiments Performed Using Different Equivalents of Active
Methylene Moiety for the Synthesis of 4H-Chromenes
From the control experiments,
we came to know about the change
in reactivity of the catalyst due to the change in equivalents of
the reactants used in the reaction. Hence, we performed the reactions
of various substituted salicylaldehyde derivatives with malononitrile
or ethyl cyanoacetate shown in Scheme 3. We successfully synthesized several substituted 2-(2-amino-3-cyano-4H-chromen-4-yl) malononitrile molecules by varying substitution
at salicylaldehyde (Table 4, 6a–f). Various fluoro,
chloro, bromo, methoxy, and nitro derivatives of salicylaldehyde were
tried, and all of them resulted in the desired products, respectively.
In the reaction of salicylaldehyde and ethyl cyanoacetate, although
the reactions proceeded well, due to purification issues, the pure
products could not be isolated (Table 4, 6g–h). These substituted
2-(2-amino-3-cyano-4H-chromen-4-yl) malononitrile
molecules have shown various biological activities, and their derivatives
are used for various applications.57,58

a NP = pure product could not be isolated.

There are only few reports available
in the literature based on
the synthesis of indole-substituted 4H-chromenes.
Among them, some are catalyzed by homogeneous catalysts and some with
the heterogeneous catalysts. We also compared the activity of our
NPGCN nanocomposite catalyst with some earlier reports in the literature
(Table 5), which revealed
that our catalyst was equally good in comparison with other reported
catalysts. In addition, our developed catalyst is heterogeneous and
nonmetal in nature.

Because all of the
reactions catalyzed by NPGCN have been performed
under Green conditions, there was no waste generated during the course
of this multicomponent reaction. Hence, looking at the industry point
of view, we performed a model gram-scale reaction to show the industrial
potential of the NPGCN catalyst and is presented in Scheme 4. We performed our model reaction
with 10 mmol of each salicylaldehyde, malononitrile, and indole, respectively,
and conducted the reaction using 10 wt % NPGCN catalyst. A very good
product yield (93%) was obtained for the gram-scale reaction similar
to that for the small-scale one. Hence, we could confirm the industrial
potential of the developed NPGCN catalyst under Green and sustainable
conditions.

Scheme 5 represents
the catalytic cycle and the mechanism of the proposed catalytic reaction
for the synthesis of 2-amino 4H-chromenes. In brief,
malononitrile in the presence of the NPGCN catalyst loses its active
hydrogen and becomes nucleophilic (shown by 1). After
that, the electrophilic center of salicylaldehyde gets attacked by
malononitrile (shown by 2) and forms an intermediate 3. The intermediate 3 after the loss of a water
molecule forms another unstable 2-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)malononitrile
intermediate 4. Due to the presence of the ortho hydroxyl
group in intermediate 4, it cyclizes to form another
intermediate 2-imino-2H-chromene-3-carbonitrile 5. The intermediate 5, due to its high electrophilic
nature, easily gets attacked via Michael addition of indole to form
the product 6.

Finally, we performed recyclability studies to check the
catalytic
potential of our developed heterogeneous catalyst (Figure 9). After each cycle, the catalyst
was washed with water and ethanol followed by drying for 12 h at 70
°C and then used for the next cycle. The catalyst was successfully
recovered up to the fifth cycle without any significant loss in catalytic
activity, and more than 80% yield was obtained.

Conclusions
In
summary, the NPGCN nanocomposite prepared using ammonia-doped
PANI and GCN is proved to be highly efficient, recyclable, metal-free,
and a Green heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of various indole-substituted
4H-chromenes. The NPGCN catalyst has several distinctive
features such as high catalytic potential, excellent yields in less
reaction time, and tuning of reactivity for the applications to the
synthesis of several bioactive molecules. Furthermore, reactions performed
in water (a universal Green solvent) are also an additional benefit
of this developed protocol. In addition, the NPGCN catalyst could
be effortlessly recovered from reaction mixtures and could be recycled
multiple times without much loss in activity. Moreover, the high atom
economy (>94%) and lower E-factor (0.13) observed
for this catalytic reaction favor the synthesis of various indole-substituted
4H-chromenes similar to other Green and sustainable
approaches.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
All of the necessary chemicals
were procured
from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, and Fischer Scientific suppliers based
in India. For PANI synthesis, ammonium persulfate and HCl were purchased
from Merck, India, and aniline monomer was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
India. Liquid ammonia was purchased from Merck, India. Hexane and
ethyl acetate eluent for silica gel column chromatography were supplied
by Fischer Scientific and Merck, India, respectively. Dicyandiamide
was also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India. All of the purchased
chemicals were used without any additional purification.

Synthesis of
GCN Nanosheets
Graphitic carbon nitride
(GCN) nanosheets were prepared by a well-reported literature method.69 In brief, 5 g of dicyandiamide was placed in
a crucible and was heated at 550 °C (at a rate of 5 °C/min)
in a muffle furnace for 3 h. After this step, the material was crushed
into fine powder with the help of a mortar–pestle and recalcinated
at the same temperature (i.e., 550 °C) for another 3 h to obtain
the final yellow product.

Synthesis of PANI
Synthesis of PANI
was carried out
by an oxidative polymerization method.52,70 In this method,
aniline was polymerized in the presence of an acid (generally HCl
or H2SO4) and ammonium persulfate as an oxidant.
In brief, aniline (0.5 mL) and HCl (6 mL) were taken in a round-bottom
flask and to it 15 mL of water was added. This mixture was cooled
at 0 °C, followed by dropwise addition of ammonium persulfate
(180 mg in 3 mL water). Subsequently, the mixture was stirred continuously
for 6 h to obtain a green precipitate, which was filtered off and
washed several times with ethanol and water. Finally, the polyaniline
(i.e., emeraldine salt) product was obtained by drying at 70 °C
for 12 h.

Synthesis of PANI–GCN Nanocomposite (PGCN)52
In a round-bottom reaction vessel containing
50 mL of deionized water, 1.5 g of GCN, 550 mg of ammonium persulfate
((NH4)2S2O8), and 18 mL
of 1 M HCl were added. The above mixture was stirred for 1 h at 0
°C. After stirring for 1 h, 1.5 mL of aniline was added dropwise
to the cooled mixture and the reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C
for 10 h. After completion of reaction, the green precipitate of PANI–GCN
(PGCN nanocomposite) was filtered off and washed repeatedly with ethanol
and water until the filtering solution becomes colorless. Finally,
the obtained PANI–GCN (1:1) composite was dried at 70 °C
for 12 h. Similarly, two other nanocomposites of PANI–GCN (1:2)
and (1:4) were synthesized by varying the amount of aniline in the
above-mentioned procedure.

Synthesis of N–PANI–GCN Nanocomposite
(NPGCN)
For this synthesis, 500 mg of the PANI–GCN
(PGCN) nanocomposite
was taken in a round-bottom flask and 50 mL of 1 M NH3 solution
was added to it. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h at
RT. After 3 h, a dark blue solid of N–PANI–GCN (NPGCN
nanocomposite) was filtered off. The solid material obtained was washed
with 50 mL of NH3 solution and was dried in an oven at
70 °C for 12 h.

General Synthetic Protocol for Synthesis
of Indole-Substituted
4H-Chromenes (3a–l)
In a round-bottom 10 mL reaction flask, indole (1 mmol),
salicylaldehyde (1 mmol), malononitrile (1 mmol), NPGCN catalyst (5
wt %), and water (2 mL) were placed, and the reaction mixture was
stirred at 55 °C temperature. Progress of the reaction and subsequent
formation of the product were periodically monitored by silica-gel-coated
aluminum thin-layer chromatography (TLC). After complete conversion
of the starting material, water was decanted from the reaction mixture
and ethanol was added to the reaction flask to extract the product.
The mixture was then centrifuged to separate the NPGCN nanocomposite
catalyst. The ethanol layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate,
and the solvent was evaporated to get the crude mixture using a rotary
evaporator. The obtained crude mixture was purified by silica gel
column chromatography using eluting mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate.
All of the new compounds were characterized for melting point by 1H and 13C NMR spectra and high-resolution mass
spectrometry (HRMS) data. All of the known compounds were characterized
by 1H and 13C NMR spectra.

General Synthetic
Protocol for the Synthesis of Bioactive 4H-Chromene
Derivatives (6a–g)
In a
10 mL round-bottom flask, salicylaldehyde or substituted
salicylaldehyde (1 mmol) and malononitrile or ethyl cyanoacetate (2
mmol) were taken. The NPGCN catalyst (10 wt %) and ethanol (2 mL)
were added to the above mixture, and the reaction mixture was stirred
at ambient temperature. The progress of the reaction was monitored
by silica-gel-coated aluminum TLC. After completion of the reaction,
most of the products were precipitated out and were simply filtered
off and washed with ethanol. Finally, to remove the catalyst, the
solid residue on the filter paper was dissolved in ethyl acetate and
dried using a rotary evaporator to obtain the pure product. No column
chromatography was required. All unknown compounds were characterized
for melting point by 1H and 13C NMR spectral
and HRMS data. All of the known compounds were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectra.

Note: Those reaction
mixtures in which solid precipitates were not found were simply filtered
off to remove the catalyst. To the remaining filtrate, ice-cold water
was added, which resulted in the precipitation of the products. Finally,
the precipitates of the pure products were filtered off and dried.
