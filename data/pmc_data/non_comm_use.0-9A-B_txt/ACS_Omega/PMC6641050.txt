Although
graphitic materials were thought to be hydrophobic, recent
experimental results based on contact angle measurements show that
the hydrophobicity of graphitic surfaces stems from airborne contamination
of hydrocarbons. This leads us to question whether a pristine graphitic
surface is indeed hydrophobic. To investigate the water wettability
of graphitic surfaces, we use molecular dynamics simulations of water
molecules on the surface of a single graphene layer at room temperature.
The results indicate that a water droplet spreads over the entire
surface and that a double-layer structure of water molecules forms
on the surface, which means that wetting of graphitic surfaces is
possible, but only by two layers of water molecules. No further water
layers can cohere to the double-layer structure, but the formation
of three-dimensional clusters of liquid water is confirmed. The surface
of the double-layer structure acts as a hydrophobic surface. Such
peculiar behavior of water molecules can be reasonably explained by
the formation of hydrogen bonds: The hydrogen bonds of the interfacial
water molecules form between the first two layers and also within
each layer. This hydrogen-bond network is confined within the double
layer, which means that no “dangling hydrogen bonds”
appear on the surface of the double-layer structure. This formation
of hydrogen bonds stabilizes the double-layer structure and makes
its surface hydrophobic. Thus, the numerical simulations indicate
that a graphene surface is perfectly wettable on the atomic scale
and becomes hydrophobic once it is covered by this double layer of
water molecules.

Introduction
After the discovery
of exfoliated graphene,1 significant attention
has been focused on next-generation graphene-based
materials because of graphene’s exceptional electronic and
thermal properties.2,3 These materials are expected to
lead to several applications, such as semiconducting devices,1,4 and thermoelectric devices.2,3,5 To develop practical applications, understanding the adhesion between
these materials and water in ambient air is vital. Over the past decades,
graphene was thought to be hydrophobic;6 however, recent experimental results have called into question the
wettability of graphene. The experimentally observed hydrophobicity
of graphitic surfaces are partly due to airborne contamination on
the surface.7−15 Spectroscopic measurements, for example, indicate that the hydrophobicity
is due to adherent hydrocarbons.12 Numerical
simulations also indicate that the presence of hydrocarbons enhances
the surface hydrophobicity of graphene.16 Thus, the simple question arises as to whether graphene surfaces
are inherently hydrophilic or hydrophobic.

The hydrophobicity
or hydrophilicity of a surface is often associated
with the wettability of the surface. The water wettability is experimentally
evaluated by measuring the contact angle.6 The contact angle and thus the wettability depend significantly
on the strength of the interactions between water and the surface.
What is the wettability of pristine graphene? Developing a microscopic
understanding of the wettability of pristine graphene is greatly advanced
by numerical simulations. Water droplets on graphene surfaces have
been studied for over a decade by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.17,18 The water contact angle can be calculated using the Young equation
in terms of surface tension.19−21 The water contact angle strongly
depends on the interaction between graphene and a water molecule.
In fact, the interaction strength qualitatively affects the wettability
of graphene in simulations.22,23 Vast theoretical works
have focused on precisely determining the interaction parameters between
graphene and a water molecule.16,24−26 The recent study by Wu and Aluru provided the interaction parameters
for the Lennard-Jones potential on the basis of first-principles calculations.16 Using these parameters, they found that the
water contact angle on a pristine graphene surface is approximately
36.4°, which is less than the previously reported values and
increases with the increasing density of contaminating hydrocarbons
on the graphene surface.16 Although these
numerical studies have revealed the wettability of pristine graphene,
there still exists huge discrepancy in the droplet size between experiments
and simulations. This dilemma prevents us from understanding the graphene
wettability from a macroscopic point of view.

To understand
the wettability of graphene, the atomic-scale behavior
of interfacial water molecules on the surface must be studied. Water
molecules have been confirmed to form layered structures on a graphene
surface,27−37 and such structures are also confirmed to be formed on the surface
of carbon nanotubes.38 The formation of
an icelike water monolayer is also studied on metal surfaces and is
reported to affect the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the surfaces.39−42 In addition, two-dimensionally confined water layers are reported
to form a regular structure in the interfacial layer between graphene
and mica43 and between graphene layers.44 The existence of the interfacial water layer
on the metal oxide surface is also reported using the first-principles
calculations.45 A similar double-layer
structure in confined geometry of hydrophobic surfaces is also reported.46−48 Although the formation of the interfacial water layers is reported
on top of several hydrophobic surfaces, the relationship between the
layer formation and the wettability has not been discussed so far.

Here, we show that our simulations suggest that a double layer
of water molecules forms on the graphene surface and plays a critical
role in the wettability of graphene. To investigate the behavior of
water in surface-constrained systems, we focus on the formation of
hydrogen bonds. By examining hydrogen-bond formation, we clarify the
formation mechanism of the double-layer structure. Moreover, we examine
how the microscopic layered structure of water molecules affects macroscopic
hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties. The results of examining the wettability
of graphene surfaces from a microscopic standpoint suggest a new paradigm
in the wettability of graphene.

Results and Discussion
Formation
of Layered Structures
A water cluster was
dropped onto a graphene surface. Figure 1 shows the snapshots of the simulation with
the boundary conditions of the (32 × 32) graphene supercell.
In Figure 1, N denotes the number of water molecules. As the simulation
time progresses, a small water cluster spreads and forms a two-dimensional
island structure [see Figure 1c]. For larger water droplets, the graphene surface becomes
fully covered by water molecules. At the level of simulations, these
numerical observations indicate that the graphene surface can be wetted,
which means that the surface is hydrophilic on the atomic scale. Upon
increasing the number of molecules, it was confirmed that water molecules
formed a double-layer structure on the surface [Figure 1e]. Above the double layer, the water molecules
form no specific arrangements other than three-dimensional lump structures
[Figure 1f].

MD simulations of a water droplet falling onto a (32
× 32) graphene supercell surface. (a, b) Water droplet is positioned
above the graphene surface and (c) is adsorbed and spreads out over
the surface. (d–f) As the number of water molecules increases,
a layered structure appears.

To examine how water molecules behave on a graphene surface,
we
have investigated the spatial probability distribution of water molecules
on the surface. Figure 2 shows the distribution functions of the density of oxygen and hydrogen
atoms of water as a function of distance z from the
graphene surface. For the oxygen atoms, the density distribution shows
two peaks at z = 3.4 and 6.1 Å, as shown in Figure 2a. The appearance
of these two peaks for the oxygen distribution indicates that the
water molecules form a layered structure on the graphene surface.
For the distribution of the hydrogen atoms [Figure 2b], four peaks appear for N ≥ 384. Two peaks appear, that is, one at z = 3.2 Å and one at z = 6.5 Å, near the
peak positions of the oxygen distribution. In addition, two rather
small peaks appear at z = 4.3 and 5.1 Å, which
are located between the first two layers. These characteristic peak
distributions of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms are maintained even
as the number of water molecules increases, meaning that the double-layer
structure of water remains unchanged at the graphene/water interface.
No clear peaks are found for z > 9 Å. The
appearance
of the peaked distribution of hydrogen atoms suggests that the direction
of the O–H bonds in the first two layers is highly oriented.

atoms as a function of distance from the graphene surface. (c) Cumulative
distributions of oxygen atoms. (d) Density of the first water layer
for several sizes of graphene supercells.

We investigate the water molecules involved in the first
layer
by the cumulative distribution function with respect to distance z, as shown in Figure 2c. From the value of the cumulative distributions at
the point between the first and second layers, the number, Nlayer, of water molecules in the first layer
is estimated to be about 150 for the periodic boundary conditions
of the (16 × 16) graphene supercell. The density of the first
layer is evaluated to be 1.015 g/cm3, which remains quantitatively
unchanged irrespective of the size of the unit cell in the simulations
[see Figure 2d]. In
what follows, instead of the number of molecules, N, we define the number of layers to be L = N/Nlayer.

Orientation
Analyses
To examine the bond orientation
in the double layer, we have analyzed the direction of O–H
bonds and the orientation of the H–O–H plane of the
water molecules. Figure 3 shows the distributions of the angle θ, representing the direction
of O–H bonds with respect to the normal to the graphene surface,
and the distributions of the angle ϕ between the H–O–H
plane and the graphene plane. Both distributions are plotted as a
function of z (distance from the graphene surface).
For L ≈ 1, where only a single layer forms,
a peak appears at cos θ = 0 for the O–H bond distribution
and at cos ϕ = 1 for the H–O–H plane distribution
[see Figure 3b,e, respectively].
This indicates that the O–H bonds are parallel to the graphene
surface.a Such specific orientations of water
molecules in the first layer are also confirmed even for a greater
number of layers. For the O–H angle distributions for L ≈ 2, a new peak at cos θ = 1 appears
at the position of the first layer (z ≈ 3
Å), in addition to the peak at cos θ = 0 [see Figure 3c,i]. This means
that the O–H bonds in the first layer are primarily oriented
either normal or parallel to the graphene surface. Similar results
but with different force fields are also reported in refs (36, 50, 51). At the position
of the second layer (z ≈ 6 Å), the distribution
of the O–H bond angle shows peaks at cos θ = 0.2
and −1. Thus, in the second layer, the O–H bonds are
oriented parallel to the graphene surface or to the direction pointing
to the graphene. For the distributions of the H–O–H
plane angle [Figure 3f], a peak at cos ϕ = 1 and a broad peak near cos ϕ
= 0 appear for both the first and second layers. These analyses are
consistent with the observations that the hydrogen distribution slightly
peaks at the interlayer region [see Figure 2b]. This water-layer structure on the graphene
surface is drawn schematically in Figure 4a. The peak positions at the first and second
layers persist even for a larger number of layers, for example, for L = 6.83 [see Figure 3d,g, respectively]. Above the double layer (at about z > 8 Å), the distribution shows no distinct peaks,
which means that the O–H bonds and the H–O–H
plane are randomly oriented.

O–H bond and

Hydrogen-Bond Formations
Numerous peculiar properties
of water are well known to originate from hydrogen-bond formation.
We demonstrate that the layered structure is attributed to the formation
of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. A hydrogen bond is defined
to form if the distance between an oxygen atom of a water molecule
and a hydrogen atom of another molecule is less than 2.5 Å, which
is the standard criterion used in previous studies.52,53 The position of the hydrogen bond is defined as the midpoint between
the oxygen and hydrogen atoms that partake in the bond. Figure 4b shows the distribution of
the hydrogen bond positions as a function of z. The
distinct peaks in this distribution are similar to the density distributions
for oxygen and hydrogen atoms, as shown in Figure 4c,d, respectively. Thus, as drawn schematically
in Figure 4a, the water
molecules are definitely oriented in the layered structure. In fact,
hydrogen bonds are formed between the first two layers and also within
each layer. Such a bilayer structure has also been confirmed experimentally
on metal surfaces at low temperature.54,55 This conclusion
is consistent with the result that the O–H bonds are oriented
either parallel or perpendicular to the graphene surface.

Here,
we remark our choice of the water models in our classical MD simulations:
We have used rigid water models, including extended simple point charge
(SPC/E), TIP4P, and TIP5P models, to demonstrate the bilayer formation.
The previous study55 has used ab initio
MD simulations to explain the formation of the bilayer ice structure
on Pt surfaces. Although the molecular vibrations significantly affect
the static ice structure at low temperature, in our simulations at
room temperature, dynamical inter-molecular interactions of hydrogen
bonds dominate the formation of the bilayer structure. Thus, we suppose
that the molecular vibrations hardly affect the bilayer formation.
In addition, we remark the interaction between water and graphene:
In our simulations, we have adopted the Lennard-Jones potentials with
the parameters evaluated by first-principles calculations.16 Recent first-principles calculations using density
functional theory have revealed that the geometrical and electronic
properties strongly affect the water wettability on metal oxide surfaces.45 However, on the pristine graphene surfaces,
the interaction between water and graphene is weak and almost uniform,
leading to negligibly small polarization of a water molecule.26 This means that the geometrical effects caused
by the surface defects are negligible.

The fact that water molecules
form the structured layers described
above is of significant importance for the water wettability of graphene.
In the double layer, water molecules form hydrogen bonds within each
layer and between the layers even at room temperature. In other words,
the O–H bonds in the second layer do not extend toward the
exterior of the layer. Furthermore, the oxygen-atom lone pairs are
hydrogen-bonded with the water molecules within the layer. As a result,
no “dangling hydrogen bonds” appear on the second layer
surface. Although the hydrogen bonds instantaneously break and reform
at 298 K on the order of picoseconds because of thermal fluctuations,
the hydrogen bonds are confined within the layers to form a long-term
statistically stable structure. Therefore, an exterior water molecule
essentially cannot form a hydrogen bond on the surface of the second
layer, which means that water molecules just above the layered structure
do not reduce their energy by forming hydrogen bonds with the layer.
This argument is supported by the potential-energy profile of a water
molecule. Figure 5 shows
the potential energy of a water molecule as a function of z. The potential-energy profile in the z direction has local minima at z = 3.4 and 7.6 Å,
and the energies at these minima are lower than those of the bulk
water. This means that the interfacial water molecules on the graphene
surface are stabilized, even at the room temperature, by the formation
of the layered structures. Note that a potential-energy barrier appears
at z ≈ 9 Å (see the black arrow in Figure 5), just above the
surface of the second layer, indicating the separation in the hydrogen-bond
network between the second layer and the stacked water cluster. These
observations imply that a graphene surface covered with such a double
layer of water molecules has a hydrophobic character, whereas the
graphene surface itself is wettable on the atomic scale. For a lower
temperature, the formation of the bilayer structures is reinforced
because the hydrogen bonds are more stabilized. On the other hand,
in our simulations, the double-layer structure persists up to about
340 K.

Figure 5 Potential energy per water molecule as a function of z. The potential energy consists of the interactions between water
molecules and the Lennard-Jones potential energy between a water molecule
and graphene. The black horizontal line indicates the potential energy
of a water molecule in a free-standing slab layer (we use a 40 Å
thick slab layer), which is obtained by averaging over the water molecules
in the center region of the slab. The black arrow at z = 9.1 Å indicates the position of the potential barrier between
the double layer of water molecules and exterior water molecules.

Conclusions
We
have examined the wettability of graphene surfaces by MD simulations.
The results indicate that a graphene surface is completely wettable
on an atomic scale and that water molecules form a double-layered
structure on the graphene surface. The hydrogen bonds are confined
within and between these two layers and thus no “dangling hydrogen
bonds” extend toward the exterior of the double layers. Therefore,
the double-layer structure acts as a hydrophobic surface. In other
words, graphitic surfaces may be wet but only by the formation of
two layers of water molecules, which form a hydrophobic coating that
prevents further wetting. This picture sheds light on the relationship
between microscopic wettability and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity
on the macroscopic scale. Thus, the microscopic wettability of a surface
does not necessarily imply the wettability on a macroscopic scale.
This conceptual approach of water wettability can be applied not only
to graphene surfaces but also to other hydrophobic surfaces. These
fundamental results for interfacial water on a surface suggest that
the traditional concepts used to explain hydrophobic or hydrophilic
properties may need to be revisited.

Computational Methods
We examined MD simulations of water molecules dropped onto a graphene
surface. The water model was represented by the SPC/E model.56 We checked that the other water models, TIP4P
and TIP5P, showed no qualitative changes in our results. A single
layer of graphene with a lattice constant of 2.46 Å was assumed,
and all graphene carbon atoms were fixed in the simulations. Any interactions
between carbon atoms and water molecules were described by the Lennard-Jones
potential with the parameters proposed by Wu and Aluru.16 We checked that for four sets of parameters
appeared in ref (16) no qualitative changes of the statistical distribution were observed.
The simulations used a time step of 0.1 fs in an NVT ensemble at a
temperature of 298 K. The cutoff length is 10 Å, and the treatment
of the Coulobmic long-range interaction is by the Ewald method. A
velocity rescaling thermostat was globally applied to the system.
For the main results, we used periodic boundary conditions with a
(16 × 16) graphene supercell (the size effect of the boundary
box is discussed in the Supporting Information). Statistical quantities were obtained by averaging over 0.1 ns
after the system had reached thermal equilibrium. All simulations
in the present study were conducted using commercial software scigress me 2.0 (Fujitsu Ltd.).

a This preferential direction does not
occur when a single water molecule is adsorbed on graphene; the O–H
bonds prefer to point to the graphene surface as found in first-principles
studies.26,49 Even in our MD simulations of a single water
molecule, the O–H bonds tend to point to the surfaces.
