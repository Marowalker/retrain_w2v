Controlling
the membrane surface properties such as hydrophobicity
and hydrophilicity is critical to achieving desirable performance.
For a long time, the difference between the surface wettabilities
of superhydrophilic poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide)
(PMIA) electrospun nanofibrous membranes (ESMs) and the superhydrophobic
parent material is believed to arise from the poling effect induced
by the electrospinning process and wicking caused by the porous membrane
structure. In this study, the short-term poling effect was eliminated
using a reference, centrifugally spun nanofibrous membrane that has
a similar fiber morphology and specific surface area to those of the
ESM; consequently, we investigated the changes in the surface properties
of the ESM in detail. Chemical analysis by angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy revealed that the N and O concentrations are greater
at the surface of the ESM. In addition, analysis of the membranes
by attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
and Raman spectra revealed that large amounts of cis conformations
of the amide bonds appeared on the surface of ESM after the electrospinning
process. The results indicate that the remarkable surface properties
of PMIA ESMs mainly arise from the change in the conformation of the
amide groups from the stable trans form to the cis form. This change
was confirmed by the subsequent in situ growth of Pt nanoparticles
and the excellent dye adsorption capacity of the membrane.

Introduction
For polymer materials,
control of the surface properties is crucial
to achieving desirable performance. For instance, poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (PMIA) is a highly crystalline fibrous
polyaramid that is widely used because of its high thermal resistivity
and excellent mechanical properties.1−3 According to the X-ray
analysis of PMIA, the polymer chains are contracted from a fully extended
state by the bonds between the phenyl rings and the amide groups and
the chains interact via intermolecular hydrogen bonds.4,5 Furthermore, mutually perpendicular hydrogen bonds are repeated
alternately along the chain axis, forming a three-dimensional “jungle-gym”-type
network, which contributes to the hydrophobicity, thermal and mechanical
stability, and flame resistance of the fibers.

However, owing
to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, high crystallinity,
and lack of polar functional groups in the polymer chains, the surfaces
of the PMIA fibers are chemically inert, resulting in their poor interactions
with many dyes and solvents and low adhesion to other materials, which
poses difficulties in processing PMIA.6−8 Therefore, the surface
properties such as the wetting behavior of PMIA must be improved.

Various alternative processing routes have been developed to modify
the relatively inert polymer surface, including chemical treatment,
plasma discharge, and even treatment with supercritical carbon dioxide.9−11 For example, N-substitution of the amide hydrogen by allyl or alkyl
groups reduces the stiffness of the polymeric chain, increasing its
solubility in organic solvents.12,13 In addition, the insertion
of carboxylic acid groups into the PMIA main chain improves both the
polymer wetting behavior and its interaction with adhesive resins.
Furthermore, exposure to ultraviolet radiation improves the affinity
of the polymer for dyes.14 Finally, the
deposition of a poly(dopamine) layer on PMIA enables the binding of
metal ions, allowing metal reduction and formation of nanoparticles
(NPs), producing a polymer with electrical resistivity.15

Recently, a mixture of LiCl in N,N-(dimethylacetamide)
(DMAC) has been shown to be a solvent that, to some extent, improves
the processability of PMIA, making the polymer flexible.16,17 The lithium ions can form strong interactions with the carbonyl
group of DMAC, whereas the chloride ions are left unbound and can
act as highly active nucleophilic bases, which play a major role in
the disruption of the inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds.18 Upon elimination of hydrogen bonds, the three-dimensional
jungle-gym-type network is broken, resulting in an increase in polymer
flexibility; furthermore, the asymmetric molecular structure shows
some weak self-charged characteristics, opening the possibility of
its use as a nanofiltration membrane for reaction with heavy metal
ions.19,20 Such a processed membrane still shows low
degree of hydrophilicity.

More recently, electrospun nanofibers
of PMIA have been shown to
have improved specific surface areas, significantly enhanced surface
properties (hydrophilicity), and broad applications.21,22 For example, hydrophilic PMIA nanofibers have been applied as a
nanofibrous membrane to remove SiO2 NPs from water.23 In addition, by combining PMIA nanofibers and
an in situ polymerized fluorinated polybenzoxazine functional layer
incorporating SiO2 NPs, Tang et al. prepared a superhydrophobic
and superoleophilic nanofibrous membrane for water/oil separation.24

Interestingly, the surface properties
of PMIA nanofibers are dramatically
different from those of commercial inert fibers, becoming superhydrophilic
when the nanofibers are electrospun. This advantageous surface property
is commonly recognized as the result of the electrical poling effect
caused by the high-voltage electrospinning process and the wicking
effect resulting from the porous structure of the PMIA membranes.
However, the effect of poling can be easily lost. In addition, for
a nanofibrous material, the hydrophilicity of the surface may arise
from the surface charge characteristics or the wicking effect, which
always arises from the porous structure of the fibrous material. However,
to date, the cause of the dramatic surface changes observed for PMIA,
whether the charge resulting from the residual poling, wicking, or
another effect, is unknown.

In this study, to minimize the influence
of wicking from the porous
structure of nanofibers, we prepared a PMIA electrospun nanofibrous
membrane (ESM), and by applying a centrifugally spun nanofibrous membrane
(CSM) as a reference sample, the changes in the surface properties
of the membranes at the molecular level were investigated.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Commercial PMIA pulp (fiber length 0.5–3
mm) was provided by Chengdu Boxing Co. Ltd. (China). Analytical grade
DMAC and LiCl, used as the solvent, were purchased from Aladdin Reagents.
Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) and l-ascorbic acid were analytical grade reagents
and were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. All of the
other chemicals were of analytical reagent grade.

Preparation
of the PMIA Solution
LiCl was dried in
a vacuum dryer at 120 °C for 2 h, and the primed PMIA pulps were
treated with methanol, acetone, and ethanol successively, followed
by drying in a vacuum dryer at 80 °C for 2 h.

LiCl (0.85
g) was added to DMAC (10.7 mL) and stirred until completely dissolved.
Then PMIA pulp (1.58 g) was added to the solution and stirred at 90
°C until completely dissolved, yielding a 15 wt % solution.

Preparation of the PMIA Membranes
The 15 wt % PMIA
solution (1 mL) was fed through the plastic microtip of a 10 mL syringe.
Electrospinning was carried out at an applied voltage of 30 kV, the
distance between the collector and the tip of the syringe was 10 cm,
and the flow rate of the solution was 0.35 mL h–1. The relevant temperature and humidity were 25 ± 2 °C
and 40 ± 2%, respectively. The obtained ESM was immersed in water
and ethanol for 12 h alternately and dried at 80 °C for 10 h
to remove the solvent completely.

The CSM was prepared by a
homemade centrifugal spinning machine,25 which includes a needle, a spinneret, an annular fiber collector,
and a motor. The needle (l = 1 cm, d = 0.2 mm) was mounted on the spinneret, and the spinneret was fixed
on a shaft and controlled by the motor. In this study, the rotational
speed of the spinneret was set to 6000 rpm. The distance between the
needle tip and the rod collector was 12 cm. All fiber spinning was
performed at 25 ± 2 °C and 40 ± 2%, respectively.

A cast membrane (CM) was also prepared from the 15 wt % PMIA solution.
The post-treatment processes for the CSM and CM were the same as those
for the ESM. To ensure complete removal of the solvent, we controlled
the thickness of the CM to be less than 50 μm.

In Situ Growth
of Pt NPs on Membrane Fibers
The membrane
was first immersed in an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (15 mL, 0.01 M, 0.1 M) with agitation for 12 h to ensure
Pt adsorption on the self-charged PMIA fibers. These sites become
active sites following the nucleation and growth of Pt NPs. Then,
a certain amount of l-ascorbic acid (0.5 M), which was used
as a reducing agent, was added to the above membrane/Pt mixture, and
the reaction mixture was stirred and heated to reflux at 80 °C
for 15 min. After reflux, the membrane was removed, thoroughly rinsed
in deionized water, and dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight.
The obtained samples are denoted ESM/Pt, CSM/Pt, and CM/Pt in the
following discussion.

Dye Adsorption Experiments
The adsorption
of a dye
on the membrane in solution was studied at room temperature in batch
mode. The dye adsorption isotherms of the ESM/CSM were measured by
varying the initial dye concentrations. The membrane adsorbent (0.025
g) was placed in the aqueous solution (10 mL) containing different
concentrations of the dyes (ranging from 2 to 100 mg L–1) at room temperature. The solutions were then vigorously stirred
until equilibrium was reached. After adsorption, the sample membrane
was removed and the absorption spectrum of the solution was measured
with a UV–visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometer.

The amount of dyes adsorbed per unit mass was calculated by 1  where C0 and Ce are the
initial and equilibrium concentrations
of dyes (mg L–1), m is the mass
of the PMIA membrane sample (g), and V is the volume
of the solution (L).

In the mixed dye adsorption experiment,
the adsorbent (0.025 g)
and the aqueous solution (10 mL) with a total concentration of 30
mg L–1 of the dye were used. All of the adsorption
experiments were performed at approximately pH 7 and at room temperature.

Characterization
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images were taken using a field-emission scanning electron microscope
(FESEM, ZEISS VLTRA-55, 10 kV). Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS,
IncaEnergy-200) was used to investigate the sample compositions. The
static contact angle (CA) of water on the surface of a sample pellet
was measured by a contact angle goniometer (Rame-Hart 100-10 Model).
UV–vis absorbance spectra were measured using a Perkin-Elmer
Lambda 35 scanning spectrophotometer.

Attenuated total reflectance
Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra were recorded using
a Nicolet 5700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with an ATR apparatus. The
resolution was 4 cm–1, and the average result of
60 automatic scans from 4000 to 650 cm–1 was output
as the test result.

The Raman spectra were acquired with a Trivista
CRS Raman spectrometer
(Princeton Instruments) with a laser wavelength (λ) of 514.5
nm. All Raman spectra were parallel-polarized, which means that the
polarization of the incident photons from the laser and the polarization
of the scattered photons were parallel.

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCALab220i-XL
spectrometer with 300 W Al Kα radiation. The base pressure was
about 3 × 10–9 mbar, and the spectra were collected
mainly at the takeoff angle of 90°. The binding energies were
referenced to the C 1s line at 284.6 eV from adventitious carbon.
Wide energy survey scans were acquired from 0 to 1100 eV, and detailed
high-resolution spectra were acquired from 280 to 292 eV for C (1s),
394 to 406 eV for N (1s), and 524 to 536 eV for O (1s). The spectra
were fitted using XPSpeak41 software and Shirley background subtraction.
Atomic compositions were calculated from high-resolution spectral
peak areas after normalizing with individual atomic sensitivity factors.
For angle-resolved measurements, the electron detector angle was varied
from 5 to 30, 60, and 90°, corresponding to sampling depths of
approximately 2.5, 4.5, 7.0, and 9.5 nm.

The apparent CAs of
the samples of water were measured by the sessile
drop method using a DSA-100 optical contact-angle meter (Kruss Company
Ltd., Germany) using liquid droplets of water (3 μL in volume).

Results and Discussion
In this study, commercial PMIA was
first dissolved in a solution
of LiCl/DMAC. Subsequently, using either electrospinning or centrifugal
spinning, nanofibers were prepared. Finally, the solvent was completely
removed, yielding either the PMIA ESM or CSM, both of which had very
similar morphologies. Note that, first, to eliminate the influence
of solvent and any possible charge storage of the electrospun nanofibers
(that is, the poling effect from the electrospinning process) completely,
the following procedures were carried out. Both the ESM and CSM samples
were treated with water and ethanol for 12 h alternately and dried
at 80 °C for 10 h to remove the solvent completely. The results
of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and the wide energy
survey XPS scans demonstrate that the surfaces of both ESM and CSM
contain carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen only, and the elemental compositions
of the ESM and CSM are the same (see Figure S1). This result suggests that no new functional groups or substances
have been introduced. At the same time, alternately washing the membranes
with water and ethanol and heating at a high temperature was found
to be an efficient way to eliminate the temporary charge storage of
the electrospun nanofibers.26,27 In addition, to minimize
the influence of wicking of the nanofibrous material, the thicknesses
of the ESM and CSM samples were controlled to be less than 50 μm.

Characterization
of the PMIA Nanofibers
Figure 1 shows the representative SEM
images of the PMIA ESM (Figure 1b,c) and CSM (Figure 1e,f). The ESM nanofibers have a relatively uniform size with
an average diameter of 250 ± 50 nm, whereas those of CSM have
a broader fiber diameter distribution, which ranged from 100 to 600
nm. In addition, the fibers of CSM were loosely packed compared to
the densely packed nanofibers of the ESM formed from the same quantity
of spinning solution. During electrospinning, the fibers were densely
deposited on the collector by the force of the electric field, resulting
in a compact structure. However, during centrifugal spinning, spiral
break-up jets freely extend outwards until they meet at the annular
collector, where fibers intertwine into membranes, resulting in a
less dense membrane.

ESM and
(d) CSM. Representative SEM images of nanofibers of the (b, c) PMIA
ESM. (e, f) Representative SEM images of nanofibers of the PMIA CSM.

Figure 1a,d shows
the water contact angle values for the PMIA ESM and CSM, respectively.
Interestingly, the samples show very different wetting behaviors:
the static contact angle of the water droplet is 121.6° (hydrophobic)
for the CSM and 0° (superhydrophilic) for the ESM (N.B., the
values of static contact angles for both samples were taken at different
locations for each measurement. In particular, for the CSM, the water
droplet is in the Wenzel state and some water is left in the porous
structure of PMIA, which will influence the measured values if measurements
are made at the same point). According to wetting theories, the ESM
and CSM have nanofibrous morphologies with rough surfaces, large surface
areas (the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area (SBET) of the PMIA ESM is 21 m2 g–1 and that of the CSM is 18 m2 g–1), and high porosities, allowing the trapping of air or liquid. However,
the two nanofibers showed significantly different wettability by water.
The results of the wide energy survey XPS scans demonstrate that the
surfaces of both CSM and ESM consist of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen,
and the elemental compositions of the samples are identical (Figure S1), indicating that no new functional
groups or substance was introduced during processing.

To further
determine the differences in the membrane surfaces,
angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) was used to
construct a depth profile of the surface at the nanometer scale by
varying the signal detection angle. We determined the surface composition
(quantitative evaluation of the C, N, and O concentrations) by tilting
the sample relative to the analyzer in four angular steps (5, 30,
60, and 90°), which correspond to test depths of 2.5, 4.5, 7.0,
and 9.5 nm.28 The results are shown in Figure 2. For the CSM, there
is no obvious concentration gradient for the elements at different
detecting depths. However, for the ESM, the C concentration was found
to gradually decrease at lower sample angles and lower depths, whereas
the N and O concentrations increase. These changes in the nanofiber
surface chemical compositions may be caused by the migration of polar
amide groups to the fiber surface during the electrospinning process.

Figure 2 ARXPS
spectra of the ESM and CSM at different test depths.

Further surface investigations were carried out
to investigate
the differences between the two samples. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is
an effective surface technique, the IR rays penetrating little into
the sample (about 0.4 μm in this work); thus, ATR-FTIR can be
used to detect changes in the surface molecular structure. ATR-FTIR
spectra are shown in Figure 3, and both samples show similar absorption bands over the
whole detection range, although some band intensities are different. Figure 3a shows the N–H
stretching region (3100–3500 cm–1). The band
at 3394 cm–1 is assigned to the “free”
N–H stretching modes,29,30 where the band intensity
for the ESM is larger than that for the CSM. In the range of 650–1700
cm–1, the band at 1608 cm–1 is
assigned to the C–C stretch of the phenyl rings,31 and the band intensity in the spectrum of the
ESM is slightly lower than that in the spectrum of the CSM (Figure 3b).

Figure 3 (a) ATR-FTIR spectra
of the ESM and CSM. Enlarged spectra in the
ranges of (b) 1200–1700 cm–1 and (c) 650–850
cm–1.

There are five adsorption bands assigned to the amide groups.
Aside
from the bands of amide II (1541 cm–1, corresponding
to N–H bending vibration) and amide III (1249 cm–1, corresponding to C–N stretching vibration), which are complicated
by coupling with the backbone and aromatic rings and thus show a slight
enhancement in intensity, the amide I (1650 cm–1, corresponding to the C=O stretching vibration), amide IV
(720 cm–1, corresponding to the N–H out-of-plane
bending vibration), and amide V (685 cm–1, corresponding
to the O–C–N bending vibration) bands exhibit significant
enhancement in intensity in the spectrum of the ESM (Figure 3b,c). The appearance of an
amide V band indicates O–C–N torsions and N–H
out-of-plane deformations.32,33 Compared to the broad
and flat band in the spectrum of the CSM, a sharp and strong band
was detected in the spectrum of the ESM, suggesting that the application
of the electric field results in significant torsion and out-of-plane
deformations of the amide groups.

Furthermore, slight blue shifts
in the characteristic amide I and
amide V bands indicate an increase in the bond strength of the amide
groups.

Figure 4 shows the
Raman spectra of the ESM and CSM. The trans amide bond is stable and
is the predominant conformation for polypeptides based on the dipole
moment.34,35 In addition, the trans conformation is also
the dominant conformation for LiCl/DMAC-dissolved PMIA (CM of PMIA,
see Figure S2).19,36 Notably, both the FTIR and Raman spectra of the CSM are similar
to those of the CM (see Figure S2), and
even the water contact angles for both membranes indicate hydrophobicity
(see Figure S4). This suggests that the
trans amide bond is also the predominant conformation in the CSM.
The bands at ca. 1268, 1571, and 1622 cm–1 are derived
from amide III, II, and I,
respectively, of the trans amides of the CSM.37,38 The trans amide III band is derived from a combination of C–N
stretching, N–H bending, and some C=O stretching, whereas
the trans amide II vibration is a combination of C–N stretching
and some N–H bending motions. The amide I vibration mainly
results from a combination of C=O stretching and N–H
bending.

Figure 4 Raman spectra of the CSM (black line) and ESM (red line).

The band at ca. 1480–1490 cm–1 is derived
from cis amide II, arising mainly from C–N stretching.37,38 In the Raman spectrum of the ESM at ca. 1476 cm–1, a cis amide II band appeared that has a significantly increased
intensity compared to that in the CSM; in contrast, the spectrum of
the CM contains almost no cis amide II band, and the intensity of
the band in the CSM spectrum was weak. The fact that the spectrum
of the ESM also contains a strong trans amide band indicates that
only the conformation of the surface amide groups of the PMIA ESM
changed to cis after the high-voltage treatment, although, especially
inside the nanofibers, the stable trans conformation is still predominant.

All of the data, including ARXPS, ATR-FTIR, and Raman spectra,
reveal that after electrospinning a large number of amide groups on
the surface of the PMIA nanofibers are in the cis conformation, which
results in the exposure of a large number of C=O groups at
the surface, leading to a charged surface and interactions between
water molecules and the ESM surface. When the fibers are formed in
the absence of a high-voltage electric field, the stable trans conformation
of the surface amide groups is predominant, although a few cis amide
groups may be present occasionally because of the flexibility of the
PMIA chain.

Scheme 1 shows a
possible formation mechanism for the cis conformation of the PMIA
ESM. At first, because of the three-dimensional jungle-gym-type hydrogen-bonded
network within the PMIA chains, the bulk PMIA is hydrophobic. Using
LiCl/DMAC as the solvent, the inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds
are broken, increasing the flexibility of the PMIA chains and enabling
the occasional emergence of cis amide groups.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration
of the Formation of the cis-PMIA ESM
The flexible PMIA can be processed to yield
CSM and ESM nanofibrous
materials. The nanofibrous morphology of the CSM results in the exposure
of more cis amide groups (surface self-charged characteristics) on
the surface of the fibers. However, this self-charged characteristic
in the CSM is not sufficient to yield a hydrophilic material.

In contrast, during the electrospinning process, a Taylor cone
of the PMIA solution, which is enriched with positive charge on the
cone surface, is formed first. Then, the PMIA solution is elongated
and stretched into nanofibers by the electric field.39,40 Due to electrostatic attraction, the electronegative C=O
groups of PMIA are pulled to the surface. Therefore, in an electric
field, the conformation of the amide groups on the surface of nanofibers
changes to the higher-energy cis conformation.

Importantly,
the change from trans to cis conformation is stable,
unlike that in the electrical
poling process phenomena. Although the poling effect can be removed
easily, the PMIA ESM maintains its superhydrophilicity as an intrinsic
feature; for example, even after storage for 1 year, superhydrophilicity
can be retained (see Figure S3).

The water contact angle on the surface is an important parameter
characterizing the wetting behavior of the polymer. Although useful
for hydrophobic surfaces, contact angle measurements are limited to
hydrophilic polymers, especially for nanofibrous polymer materials
where wicking must be considered. To minimize the influence of wicking,
the thickness of membranes must be less than 50 μm, but a liquid
residue may lead to subsequent slow wicking of the whole CSM. Therefore,
to prove the charge properties derived from the enrichment of the
cis amide groups on the surface of the PMIA ESM, the in situ growth
of Pt NPs was studied and dye adsorption experiments were carried
out.

Membrane Surface Decoration with Pt NPs
The two sample
membranes were placed into a mixed aqueous solution of the Pt precursor
and l-ascorbic acid to study the surface adsorption of Pt.
As shown in Figure 5b,c, after 15 min exposure to a low concentration of the Pt precursor,
Pt NPs densely covered the surface of the ESM nanofibers. At higher
concentrations of the Pt precursor, the size of the Pt NPs increased
significantly and the Pt NPs uniformly covered the PMIA nanofibers,
forming a several hundreds of nanometers thick Pt layer. In contrast,
the CSM showed an entirely different Pt NP loading pattern. At a low
concentration of the Pt precursor, Pt NPs were deposited irregularly
on the CSM nanofibers (Figure 5e). At high concentrations of the Pt precursor, the reduced
Pt NPs were still irregularly deposited on the fibers but were larger
than those formed at low Pt concentrations (Figure 5f). Furthermore, we noticed that at the beginning
of the reaction the CSM floated on the surface of the solution and
was gradually wetted by the solution. This slow wetting can be attributed
to the wicking effect of the nanofibrous material. For use a reference
sample, we also prepared a CM and found that the membrane had a similar
Pt surface decoration behavior to that of the CSM (see Figure S4). Notably, the CM remained floating
on the surface of the solution over the whole reaction process, indicating
that there was little wicking in the CM membrane.

Figure 5 Representative SEM images
of the (a) ESM and (d) CSM, SEM images
of PMIA ESM/Pt at Pt precursor concentrations of (b) 0.01 M and (c)
0.1 M, and SEM images of PMIA CSM/Pt at Pt precursor concentrations
of (e) 0.01 M and (f) 0.1 M.

Clearly, the cis-conformation PMIA ESM, which results in
the exposure
of more C=O groups on the surface of the nanofibers, is advantageous
for the absorption of Pt ions via electrostatic attraction, resulting
in increased in situ growth of Pt NPs.

Dye Adsorption Experiments
Inspired by the effects
of the cis-conformation PMIA ESM, we tested the membrane for its effectiveness
in removing organic pollutants from water. Furthermore, because the
ESM is a macroscopic material, solid–liquid separation is easy,
occurring by settlement in a short time period. Here, we selected
Rhodamine B (RhB) as a model organic pollutant to study the dye-capturing
ability of the PMIA ESM.

Figure 6a,b shows the time-dependent UV–vis absorption
spectra of the RhB solutions treated with the PMIA membrane samples.
The initial dye concentration was fixed at 30 mg L–1. Strikingly, a significant difference in adsorption between the
ESM and CSM was observed. In comparison with the ESM, the CSM has
a poor dye adsorption capability. Notably, the PMIA ESM achieved an
ultrahigh adsorption capacity of 24.87 mg g–1 for
RhB, whereas for the CSM and CM (see Figure S5), the adsorption capacities are 10.25 and 0.93 mg g–1, respectively.

ESM and (b)
CSM. The membrane sample (0.025 g) was placed in an RhB solution (10
mL, 30 mg L–1) at room temperature. The inset image

membrane samples for RhB as a function of contact time. (d) Adsorption
isotherm curves for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB), malachite
green (MG), direct bordeaux (DB), and Congo red (CR) on the ESM.

Furthermore, the PMIA ESM exhibits
excellent adsorption capacity
for a variety of water-soluble cationic dyes (Figure 7), a property not observed for the CSM. Because
of the electronegative amide groups on the surface, the hydrophilic
PMIA ESM exhibits excellent adsorption capability for cationic dyes.
MG, DB, and MB were used to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the
ESM, and the adsorption capacities were found to be 32, 24, and 23.15
mg g–1, respectively. The adsorption of an anionic
dye, CR, was also studied, but the adsorption capacity for this dye
was only 3.02 mg g–1. By treating the PMIA ESM with
an acidic solution to change the surface charge, the adsorption of
CR was improved by 1 order of magnitude.

After 30 min, dye removal is completed. The insets are the digital
pictures of (a) the individual dye solution and (b) the mixed dye
solution before and after the adsorption treatment with the PMIA ESM.

The ability of the PMIA ESM to
absorb dyes may be attributed to
its advantageous membrane structure such as high specific surface
area, large pore volume, and unique nanofibrous morphology. However,
by comparing the two types of nanofibers, the main contributor to
the absorption appears to be the electrostatic interactions arising
from the cis amide groups on the surface of the nanofibers.

Furthermore, the adsorbed dye molecules could be removed by dipping
the adsorbed ESM in an ethanol solution (Figure 8b). As shown, the adsorbed dye molecules
are released from the ESM quickly, allowing the ESM to be reused. Figure 8a shows that after
repeated adsorption–release cycles, there is little change
in the adsorption capacity of the membrane for RhB. Consequently,
the PMIA ESM has potential applications for the rapid and deep treatment
of wastewater containing a high concentration of dye.

Conclusions
In summary, on the basis
of the experimental results for both in
situ Pt NP growth and dye adsorption, the following conclusions can
be made. When the flexible PMIA is dissolved by LiCl/DMAC, it can
be processed to yield three different membranous materials.

In comparison with the CM, the CSM is less hydrophobic because
of two reasons: first, the CSM has a larger specific surface area
owing to its nanofibrous morphology, which results in the exposure
of more cis amide groups (a surface self-charged characteristic) on
the surface of the fiber, and, second, wicking, arising from the porosity
of the nanofibrous material, occurs more easily in the CSM than in
the CM.

For the nanofibrous samples, the wettability of the
ESM is very
different from that of the CSM, and the superhydrophilicity of the
PMIA ESM can be attributed to the large number of cis amide groups
on the surface resulting from the conformational changes induced by
the electrospinning process.
Clearly, the cis amide conformation significantly enhances the electrostatic
attraction between the ESM and cations, increasing the adsorption
capacity of the membrane for the dye molecules and enhancing the in
situ growth of metal NPs.
