In this study, the waste V2O5–WO3/TiO2 denitrification
catalysts from the coal-fired
power plant were washed with water or nitric acid, followed by impregnating
different contents of V2O5. The effects of the
HNO3 concentration and the additional amount of vanadium
on the low-temperature selective catalytic reduction denitrification
activity were investigated under the condition of high concentration
of SO2 and H2O. The catalysts were characterized
by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, X-ray
powder diffraction , N2 adsorption/desorption, H2-temperature-programmed reduction, NH3-temperature-programmed
desorption , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , and Raman spectroscopy.
The evaluation results revealed that optimum activity was achieved
by using 0.8 mol/L HNO3 solution and loading 1.60 wt %
V2O5 to make the total V2O5 reach 2.3 wt %. The characterization results showed that nitric
washing can remove most of the ammonium salts deposited on the surface
of the waste catalyst and produce crystalline WO3, which
can effectively inhibit the agglomeration of vanadium species in the
process of impregnation. Furthermore, it can also increase the amount
of oligomeric VOx, which can improve the
denitration activity.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
the past decades, more and more attention has been paid to the
emission of NOx (NO, NO2) because
of its serious harm to human health and environment. More than 90%
of NOx in the atmosphere comes from the
combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas; 70% of which comes from
the direct combustion of coal. According to the statistics in 2013,1 the power industry as a large coal user accounted
for 46% of coal consumption in China. The coal-fired power plants
are one of the main sources of NOx emissions.
Among all NOx elimination technologies,
the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) by ammonia is regarded as
one of the most effective technologies. It is widely used in power
plants and other industrial sites.2 Moreover,
it is necessary to continue to expand the application of the SCR method
in flue gas denitrification of coal-fired power plants in order to
meet increasingly stringent environmental requirements. The core technology
of the SCR method is the V2O5–WO3(MoO3)/TiO2 catalyst which accounts
for 30–50% of the overall cost3 and
works in the temperature range of 300–450 °C.4

The catalytic ability of the SCR catalysts
will gradually decrease
with the increase of running time because of the deactivation of the
catalyst. The SCR catalyst deactivation is usually caused by the following
factors: blockage of fly ash and ammonium salts,5 poisoning of alkali metals6 and
alkaline earth metals,7 arsenic poisoning,8 plumbum poisoning,9 catalyst sintering,10 mechanical wear,
and so on. Therefore, it needs to be replaced regularly. Moreover,
the waste SCR catalyst (vanadium–titanium series) has been
incorporated into hazardous solid waste in China because of its own
potential environmental hazards and various heavy metals adsorbed
in the process of operation.3

Since
2013, a large number of SCR denitrification projects have
been carried out in thermal power units. Eighty percent of the SCR
catalysts is imported and their service life is 5 years. Therefore,
China will usher in the first
peak of catalyst scrapping in 2019. The waste SCR catalysts are renewable
and recyclable. Regeneration is mainly to improve the denitrification
activity of the waste catalyst, which has a low cost. Recycling is
mainly to extract TiO2, V2O5, and
WO3 from the waste catalyst, which has a high cost. Seventy
to eighty percent of these catalysts is renewable,11 and it is necessary to strengthen the research on waste
catalyst regeneration to replace the common landfill treatment.12

Taking the honeycomb type as an example,
the regeneration of the
waste catalyst is generally divided into two parts: the preliminary
washing treatment and the later active component supplementation.
The later active component supplementation is usually carried out
by immersing the block catalyst in a vanadium-containing solution;
hence, the main difference lies in the preliminary washing mode. Common
washing methods include the acid method, alkali method, acid–alkali
combined method, and ammonium salt method. The acid method includes
sulfuric acid and oxalic acid cleaning which can remove alkali metals
and other impurities on the surface of the waste catalyst.13,14 The alkali method mainly uses sodium hydroxide cleaning which can
remove aluminum sulfate deposited on the surface of the waste catalyst
and reduce its blockage.15 The acid–alkali
combined method uses alkali washing followed by acid washing,16 which aims at removing a small amount of alkali
metals introduced in the process of alkali washing. The ammonium salt
method mainly contains ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride cleaning,17 and it is found that this method can also improve
the denitrification activity of the waste catalyst.

At present,
catalyst regeneration is usually carried out by washing
a whole piece of the waste catalyst. The washing solution can effectively
remove the alkali metal, ammonium salt, and other impurities on the
surface of the waste catalyst, but the impurities in the pore passage
are difficult to clean and in some local areas, deactivation still
remained, which will also lead to misdistribution of the active components
on the carrier. Currently, sulfuric acid is commonly used during the
process of acid washing and most of the regeneration of the catalyst
focused on its recovery to the original activity as far as possible.
Therefore, in this study, the waste catalyst was first crushed and
then washed with dilute nitric acid. Finally, certain active components
were added and reshaped, which was focused on the improvement of the
overall SCR denitrification activity including the low-temperature
activity under the condition of high concentration of SO2 and H2O.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Source of Catalysts
The waste commercial
honeycomb monolith catalysts were obtained from a coal-fired power
plant in Shanxi Province provided by a catalyst recovery plant. The
catalysts had been in operation for about 40 000 h. The size
of the whole piece of the waste catalyst is 90 cm × 14 cm ×
14 cm, and the wall thickness is 1.5 mm. In addition, the surface
and the pore passage of catalysts were repeatedly rinsed using high-pressure
water in the catalyst recovery plant, so it was considered that the
original sample had been treated with water. The composition of the
waste catalyst after water washing is shown in Table 1. The waste catalyst is the V2O5–WO3/TiO2 catalyst. It
can be found that the waste catalyst contains a high concentration
of the poisoning elements such as Ca and S.

2.2 Catalyst
Regeneration
Before regeneration,
the waste catalysts were crushed to a particle size of less than 75
μm, and the regeneration solution was a mixture of oxalic acid
and ammonium metavanadate. In these experiments, the following two
methods were used to regenerate the catalysts.

One method was
to directly support active vanadium on the waste catalysts which had
been washed with water. Incipient wet impregnation was used and the
mass fractions of V2O5 were selected as 1.3,
1.8, 2.3, and 3.3%, which were based on the total vanadium content
of the catalysts. Then, the catalysts were dried at 100 °C for
10 h and calcined at 500 °C for 3 h to obtain the regenerated
catalysts.

The other method was to wash the waste catalysts
with 0.1, 0.3,
0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 mol/L HNO3 at 30 °C for 3 h, L/S
= 5, and the catalysts filtered with a lot of deionized water were
dried at 110 °C for 2 h. Then, each sample was loaded with 1.60%
V2O5 to make the total V2O5 reach 2.3%. Finally, the catalysts were dried at 100 °C for
10 h and calcined at 500 °C for 3 h to obtain the regenerated
catalysts. The catalyst samples were labeled as shown in Table 2.

2.3 Catalytic Activity Evaluation
All
the catalytic evaluations of the regenerated catalysts were tested
using a fixed-bed quartz reactor, and the inner diameter of the quartz
tube was 10 mm. The device schematic diagram of NH3-SCR
denitrification is shown in Figure S1,
and the related introduction of the experiment device was described
in our published article.18 During a denitration
experiment, the particle size of the catalyst was 0.25–0.42
mm and 200 mL/min simulated flue gas balanced with He was injected
into the system. The composition of the flue gas was NO (500 ppm),
NH3 (500 ppm), O2 (5 vol %), SO2 (1000
ppm), and H2O (10 vol %). Each flow rate was monitored
by mass flow meters and the gas hourly space velocity of the experiment
was set as 120 000 h–1. The concentration
of NO and N2O was measured by Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FT-IR). The NO conversion and selectivity of N2 were calculated according to eqs 1 and 2. 1   2  Where ηNO stands for the
NO conversion, CNO,in and CNO,out represent the import and export concentrations
of NO, respectively. SN2 is the N2 selectivity, CNO2,out is
the outlet concentration of NO2, CN2O,out is the outlet concentration of N2O, and CNH3,in is the inlet
concentration of NH3.

2.4 Catalyst
Characterization
The inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES) analysis
was carried out on an ICP emission spectrometer (SPECTRO, Kleve, Germany).
The sample digestion method was as follows: 0.06 g of sample was placed
in the reaction kettle, and then 7 mL of HNO3, 2 mL of
H2O2 and 1 mL of HF were added to the kettle
for 30 min at 120 °C. Finally, the solution was introduced from
the kettle into a volumetric flask, and the volume of the solution
was found to be 100 mL. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried
out on a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 type X-ray diffractometer equipped with
Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154056 nm). The XRD pattern
was scanned in the 2θ range from 5° to 90° at the
scanning rate of 10°/min. The specific surface area and pore
structure parameters of the catalysts were carried out with a nitrogen
physical adsorption instrument (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA).
H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR)
and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) analyses were carried out on the AutoChem II type high-performance
chemical adsorption instrument (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA).
For H2-TPR, the 100 mg sample was pretreated in a He flow
(20 mL/min) for 1 h at 300 °C and the reactor was cooled down
to 50 °C. Then, the sample was heated up to
1000 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min in a 10% H2/Ar
flow (20 mL/min), and the concentration of H2 was monitored
by the signal of the thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For NH3-TPD, pretreatment is the same as that for H2-TPR
and then exposed to 10% NH3/He at 50 °C for 30 min,
followed by a temperature ramp to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min,
and the concentration of the desorbed NH3 was also monitored
by the TCD. The FT-IR spectra were collected on a Bruker TENSOR 27
(Bruker Corporation, Karlsruhe, Germany). The Raman spectra were recorded
with a Renishaw in Via Raman spectrometer (RENISHAW LTD, UK). Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) (Jsm-6700F, JEOL, Japan) images of the samples
were obtained using an accelerating voltage of 10 kV.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Chemical Compositions of
Catalysts
The main chemical compositions of zNW catalysts
are presented in Table 3. With the increase of nitric acid concentration, the mass fraction
of V2O5 (calculated based on the mass fraction
of V) generally presents a downward trend, while it is basically maintained
at about 0.7%. The content of Na decreases gradually, and finally
about 83% of Na is removed, which greatly reduces the alkali metal
poisoning of the catalysts. A part of Fe can be effectively removed
by nitric acid washing. Besides, the content of S is greatly reduced,
while the content of Ca and Al is basically unchanged. The main forms
of sulfur may be sulfuric acid, ammonium sulfate salt, aluminum sulfate,
and calcium sulfate. However, the surface of the waste catalyst is
substantially free of aluminum sulfate and calcium sulfate. The significant
reduction of S is caused by the dissolution of a large amount of ammonium
sulfate salts or sulfuric acid on the surface of the catalyst. In
addition, the content of heavy metals such as Pb, As, and Hg is at
an extremely low level, which is basically outside the detection range
of ICP–OES. This indicates that the catalyst is not poisoned
by heavy metals.

3.2 Pore
Structure Parameters of Catalysts
The surface area, pore
volume, and average pore diameter of WW and zNW catalysts
are presented in Table 4. With the increase of the concentration
of nitric acid, the specific surface area of the waste catalyst increases
gradually and the pore size decreases generally. It can be concluded
that the appropriate increase of the nitric acid concentration can
reopen the blocked pores and increase the amount of pores with smaller
diameter, which is beneficial to the uniform distribution of vanadium
added to the surface of waste catalysts and the increase of new denitration
active sites.

Table 4 Surface area and average Pore Size
of WW and zNW Catalysts

WW	55.97	0.271	19.34	
0.1NW	57.50	0.270	18.78	
0.3NW	64.12	0.278	17.39

0.8NW	69.52	0.259	14.90	
1.0NW	69.87	0.257	14.72	
The pore size distribution of catalysts
is shown in Figure 1. Compared with the WW catalyst,
the pore volume between 2 and 16 nm of the zNW catalysts
is greatly increased with increasing concentration of nitric acid.
It is speculated that the catalyst produces many pores with pore sizes
between 2 and 16 nm. Moreover, nitric acid plays a main role in the
pore enlargement of the waste catalyst during the washing process.

distribution of catalysts.

3.3 Catalytic Activity Results
Figure 2a shows the denitration
activity profiles of the WW-x V (y %) catalysts. It can be seen that its low-temperature activity in
the range of 180–250 °C increases with increasing vanadium
content under the condition that the total V2O5 does not exceed 2.3% especially when the total V2O5 amount is 2.3%, the low-temperature activity is greatly improved.
The denitration rate increases from 30 to 80% at 225 °C. Besides,
its high-temperature activity in the range of 250–400 °C
also increased with increasing vanadium content but obviously lower
than those of WW catalysts. This is due to the masking effect on the
original active components caused by the reloaded active components.
When the total amount of V2O5 is 3.3%, the high-temperature
activity is unchanged compared with that of the former, but the low-temperature
activity is significantly decreased. Therefore, the following experiments
are based on the total amount of V2O5 being
2.3%.

Figure 2 Denitration activity of the (a) WW-x V (y %) and (b) zNW-1.60 V, 0.8NW catalysts.

According to the results of ICP, the total amount
of V2O5 can reach 2.3% when the waste catalysts
after different
concentrations of HNO3 washing were all loaded with 1.60%
V2O5. Figure 2b shows the denitration activity profiles of the zNW-1.60 V and 0.8NW catalysts. When the temperature is
lower than 225 °C, the denitration activities of zNW-1.60 V and WW-1.47 V (2.3%) are similar. However, in the temperature
range of 225–400 °C, the concentration of the acid has
important effects on the activity of catalysts. In summary, the overall
activity of the 0.8NW-1.60 V catalyst reaches the highest level. The
high-temperature activity increases to more than 85%, which is higher
than that of WW. This is consistent with the activities of 0.8NW.
Because the concentration of sulfur dioxide is different in actual
working conditions, the denitration performance under different SO2 concentrations is also investigated in order to test its
regeneration performance, which is shown in Figure S2. It can be seen that good denitration activity can still
be maintained with the change of sulfur dioxide concentration.

According to the denitration activity of all the regenerated catalysts
in the two schemes, the WW-1.47 V (2.3%) and 0.8NW-1.60 V catalysts
are selected to detect the N2O formation and N2 selectivity which is presented in Figure 3. Clearly, the N2O formation of
the 0.8NW-1.60 V catalyst is less than that of WW-1.47 V (2.3%) and
the 0.8NW-1.60 V catalyst has a better N2 selectivity which
can be above 99% in the range of 100–360 °C. It indicates
that nitric acid washing can improve the N2 selectivity
of the regenerated catalyst.

Figure 3 N2O formation (a) and N2 selectivity (b)
of the WW-1.47 V (2.3%) and 0.8NW-1.60 V catalysts.

3.4 Crystal Structures of Catalysts
The
XRD patterns of WW, WW-1.47 V (2.3%), 0.8NW, and 0.8NW-1.60 V are
presented in Figure 4. All these catalysts exhibit the typical anatase phase of TiO2, and no crystalline V2O5 species are
observed. It indicates that the crystal structure of TiO2 is not destroyed by nitric acid washing and it is still anatase.
The vanadium added to the surface of the waste catalyst is highly
dispersible.

Figure 4 XRD patterns of catalysts.

3.5 H2-TPR Analysis
The H2-TPR profiles of the WW, WW-1.47 V (2.3%), 0.8NW, and 0.8NW-1.60
V catalysts are shown in Figure 5a. The WW catalyst shows two peaks at 525 and 850 °C.
The first reduction peak is attributed to the reduction process of
V5+ → V3+, W6+ → W4+, and SO42– → SO2, and the second reduction peak is the reduction process of
W4+ → W0.19 It can be seen that the first reduction peak of both WW-1.47 V (2.3%)
and 0.8NW-1.60 V are reduced from 525 to 459 °C, indicating that
the reduction ability of these two regenerated catalysts are significantly
enhanced and close to each other, mainly because of the addition of
vanadium in the waste catalysts. Correspondingly, the low-temperature
activity of these two catalysts is greatly enhanced and also close
to each other. For 0.8NW, the first reduction peak is reduced from
525 to 475 °C and its reduction ability has also been improved
to some extent. But the peak intensity is significantly weakened because
a small amount of the vanadium is washed away by nitric acid. At the
same time, 0.8NW and 0.8NW-1.60 V show a new reduction peak located
at around 580 °C, which may be the reduction peak of crystalline
WO3 according to literature studies.20

Figure 5 H2-TPR results of (a) WW, WW-1.47 V (2.3%), 0.8NW, and
0.8NW-1.60 V and (b) zNW-1.60 V catalysts.

According to the previous research, for the V2O5–WO3/TiO2 catalyst,
WO3 is an auxiliary agent, which is introduced to compete
with the interaction
between VOx and TiO2 through
the interaction between WOx and TiO2 so as to influence the distribution and morphology of VOx on the carrier.21 Because VOx is easily distributed on
TiO2 adjacent to WOx, the content
and morphology of WOx directly affects
the state of VOx on the carrier. WOx on the carrier can be divided into amorphous
WOx and crystalline WO3, and
the appropriate amount of amorphous WOx can promote the dispersion of moderately distorted vanadium species
and prevent the self-island process of vanadium species.19 However, excessive amorphous WOx will squeeze its neighboring vanadium species and
lead to VOx aggregation or the formation
of crystalline V2O5.20 In the case of only a certain amount of amorphous WOx, when the amount of vanadium loading is low, it
is beneficial to the formation and uniform dispersion of moderately
distorted vanadium species. When the amount of vanadium loading is
high, the compression effect of WOx on
single-layer VOx will occur. Therefore,
the existence of a suitable amount of crystalline WO3 can
alleviate the competition between VOx and
WOx by reducing the richness of WOx and releasing a certain surface space on
the carrier.

As shown in Figure 2b, the denitration activity of the 0.8NW-1.60 V catalyst
is better
than that of the WW-1.47 V (2.3%) catalyst in the temperature range
of 225–400 °C. It is possible that the amorphous WOx on the surface of the WW catalyst has a
strong compression effect on the large amount of vanadium added which
leads to a certain degree of agglomeration of VOx, resulting in the decrease of activity at high temperature.
For the 0.8NW-1.60 V catalyst, because of the oxidation of nitric
acid, a certain amount of crystalline WO3 is formed on
the surface of the waste catalyst after nitric acid washing, which
can reduce the compression effect of WOx on VOx and inhibit VOx agglomeration even if the amount of vanadium is high. In this
way, more effective active sites are provided and the high-temperature
activity is also enhanced. As shown in Figure 5b, with the washing treatment at a higher
nitric acid concentration, the reduction peak strength of crystalline
WO3 increases gradually, indicating that the amount of
crystalline WO3 on the surface increases gradually.

3.6 NH3-TPD Analysis
Figure 6 shows the NH3-TPD results of
the catalysts. There are four desorption peaks
at about 90, 165, 330, and 575 °C which represent the weak acid,
medium strong acid, strong acid22 and decomposition
of ammonium sulfate on the surface of the catalysts, respectively.23 The peak of the weak acid and medium strong
acid could be related to NH3 desorbed from Brønsted
acid sites and the peak of the strong acid could belong to NH3 desorbed from Lewis acid sites.24 It can be concluded that ammonium sulfate deposits on the surface
of the waste catalyst. For WW-1.47 V (2.3%) catalysts, the peak of
ammonium sulfate has almost disappeared which may be because of the
decomposition of ammonium salts caused by calcination in the sample
preparation process, and a part of the blocked channel is opened and
the reloaded vanadium increases its low-temperature activity. However,
it can be seen from the figure that because of a certain degree of
vanadium agglomeration on the surface of the carrier, the number of
strong acid sites is greatly reduced, resulting in a decrease in the
high-temperature activity. Compared to the WW-1.47 V (2.3%) catalyst,
the number of strong acid sites of 0.8NW increases except for the
disappearance of the ammonium sulfate peak, which raises its high-temperature
activity. However, the number of weak acid sites decreases significantly,
which decreases its low-temperature activity. For 0.8NW-1.60 V catalysts,
in addition to the further increase in the number of strong acid sites,
the number of weak acid sites has also been greatly improved. Therefore,
its overall denitration activity reaches the optimum level. This shows
that most of the ammonium sulfate is washed away, and more strong
acid sites are produced under the condition of high vanadium content
after being washed by 0.8 mol/L HNO3.

of the WW, WW-1.47 V (2.3%), 0.8NW,
and 0.8NW-1.60 V catalysts.

3.7 FT-IR Analysis
Figure 7 shows the FT-IR spectra of the WW, WW-1.47
V (2.3%), and 0.8NW-1.60 V catalysts. The absorption bands at 850–1075
cm–1 are enlarged in Figure 7a. The weak band at 879 cm–1 can be assigned to the V–O stretching mode of the metavanadate
polymeric species.25 Generally, the intensity
of this peak will gradually decrease with the increase of vanadium,
and the reason is that the vanadium ions interacted with hydroxyl
groups on the surface of the carrier will gradually transform into
vanadium oxide clusters and weaken the interaction with the carrier.
The 0.8NW-1.60 V catalyst has a distinct peak at this position compared
with that of WW-1.47 V (2.3%), which indicates that there are a certain
number of vanadium ions on the surface, and the agglomeration is at
a relatively low level. The band at 987 cm–1 can
be assigned to the characteristic peak of W=O and V=O,
and the peak strength increases slightly with the increase of the
vanadium content. The band at 1050 cm–1 is related
to the typical band caused by V=O,26 in which the peak intensity increases with increasing the content
of vanadium oxides, generally. However, the peak strength of WW-1.47
V (2.3%) is less than that of WW, which indicates that the addition
of vanadium to the water-washed catalyst may give rise to the agglomeration
of vanadium oxide on the surface of the carrier, and the amount of
effective V=O is reduced, that is, the number of Lewis acid
sites is decreased, resulting in the decrease of the high-temperature
activity of the catalyst. For the 0.8NW-1.60 V catalyst, the peak
strength at 1050 cm–1 is clearly stronger than that
of the other two catalysts, which indicates that the amount of effective
V=O on its surface has increased significantly, and its high-temperature
activity is higher than that of the other two catalysts.

Figure 7 FT-IR spectra
at (a) 850–1075 and (b) 1050–1500 cm–1 of the WW, WW-1.47 V (2.3%), and 0.8NW-1.60 V catalysts.

The absorption bands at 1050–1500 cm–1 are enlarged in Figure 7b. The bands at 1211 and 1134 cm–1 are recognized
as the characteristic peaks of SO42−,27 and the band at 1400 cm–1 is
associated with NH4+.28 It can be seen that the WW catalyst has obvious peaks of SO42– and NH4+, indicating
that a certain amount of ammonium salt or other sulfates are deposited
on the surface of the WW catalyst, causing the blockage of pores.
These peak intensities of WW-1.47 V (2.3%) are greatly reduced, which
may be because of the decomposition of the ammonium salt caused by
calcination in the sample preparation process or the masking of vanadium
but some sulfates still exist. These peak intensities of 0.8NW-1.60
V are almost completely disappeared, indicating that most sulfates
can be removed by 0.8 mol/L
nitric acid washing, and it is more conducive to the distribution
of reloaded vanadium. The bands at 1450 and 1378 cm–1 are considered as the symmetric and asymmetric bending vibrations,
respectively, of NH4+ coordinated to Brønsted
acid sites,29 while the bands at 1280 and
1090 cm–1 are considered as the asymmetric and symmetric
bending vibrations of NH3 coordinated to Lewis acid sites.30 Compared with the WW catalyst, the absorption
peak strength of the WW-1.47 V (2.3%) catalyst at 1378 cm–1 increases slightly, and the Brønsted acid sites increase, which
increases its low-temperature activity. For the 0.8NW-1.60 V catalyst,
it produces two new peaks at 1450 and 1280 cm–1.
The peak strength at 1378 cm–1 is further enhanced,
and the peak strength at 1090 cm–1 is increased
significantly compared with the other two catalysts, which shows that
more Lewis acid sites are produced, increasing its high-temperature
activity.

3.8 Raman Analysis
There are four micrographs
with the same multiple taken by using a Raman spectrometer as shown
in Figure S3. The surface of the WW catalyst
is rough with a large particle size and incompact structure. It indicates
that the catalyst has a certain sintering and agglomeration phenomenon.
The yellow part on the surface of WW-1.47 V (2.3%) increases obviously
and is more aggregated, which indicates that the dispersity of vanadium
is poor. The surface of the 0.8NW catalyst is very smooth and flat,
and most of the sulfate is removed. Besides, the yellow part of the
0.8NW-1.60 V catalyst has good dispersion and no phenomenon of high
agglomeration. This is consistent with the results of SEM and element
mapping in Figure S4.

Figure 8a shows the results of Raman
spectroscopy of three samples. The bands at 396, 515, and 638 cm–1 are attributed to the anatase TiO2 structure,31 and all three catalysts have clear anatase characteristic
peaks. According to the previous study, the band at 1026 cm–1 can be assigned to the V=O vibration related to the surface
of oligomeric VOx,32 and the band at 990 cm–1 is the characteristic
peak of the V–O vibration of crystalline V2O5 when the vanadium loaded is high.33,34 The band at 800 cm–1 can be assigned to the W–O
vibration of crystalline WO3.35,36 It can be seen that the peak strength of WW-1.47 V (2.3%) at 990
cm–1 is obviously enhanced compared with that of
WW, which indicates that there are more crystalline V2O5 on the surface with distinct agglomeration. This may be the
reason for the decrease in high-temperature activity. However, the
peak of 0.8NW-1.60 V disappears at 990 cm–1 and
a new peak is generated at 1026 cm–1, showing that
the vanadium species on the surface of the sample has no agglomeration.
It produces more oligomeric VOx, which
increases its high-temperature activity. Meanwhile, the peak strength
at 800 cm–1 is significantly enhanced, indicating
that nitric acid treatment increases the amount of crystalline WO3 on the surface, which reduces the richness of WOx on the surface of the carrier and relieves the compression
effect on VOx. This effectively prevents
vanadium species from aggregating in the case of high vanadium content,
resulting in the formation of more oligomeric VOx, which is consistent with the results of H2-TPR.

Figure 8 Raman
spectra of the (a) WW, WW-1.47 V (2.3%), and 0.8NW-1.60 V
and (b) zNW-1.60 V catalysts.

The Raman bands of several zNW-1.60 V catalysts
at 850–1200 cm–1 are enlarged in Figure 8b. Compared with
WW-1.47 V (2.3%), the peak intensity of zNW-1.60
V at 990 cm–1 decreases until it disappears with
the increase of nitric acid concentration. It also means that the
amount of crystalline V2O5 is gradually decreased,
even if the total amount of vanadium is equal to each other. Finally,
more and more oligomeric VOx is produced,
which improves the high-temperature activity of the catalysts.

4 Conclusions
In this article, the mixed solution of
ammonium metavanadate and
oxalic acid was used as a precursor solution, and the regenerated
catalyst was prepared by separately loading vanadium onto the waste
catalyst after water or nitric acid washing. The conclusions can be
drawn as follows:(i) In WW-x V (y %) type
catalysts, the WW-1.47 V (2.3%) catalyst exhibits
an excellent low-temperature activity, especially the denitration
rate increases from 30 to 80% at 225 °C, but its high-temperature
activity is poor, only about 60%. In zNW-1.60 V type
catalysts, the 0.8NW-1.60 V catalyst not only has the same low-temperature
activity as the former but also has a high-temperature activity of
over 85%.

(ii) The H2-TPR and Raman results
show that nitric acid washing could generate a certain amount of crystalline
WO3 on the surface of the waste catalyst, which reduces
the compression effect of WOx on VOx when the amount of vanadium is high and
inhibits the aggregation of vanadium effectively. Meanwhile, more
oligomeric VOx are formed on the surface,
improving its overall denitration activity.

(iii) The 0.8NW-1.60 V catalyst can not
only fully achieve the denitrification effect of commercial catalysts
in coal-fired power plants but also can be applied to the environment
with lower flue gas temperature, such as glass plants and coking plants,
because of its excellent low-temperature activity and sulfur resistance.
