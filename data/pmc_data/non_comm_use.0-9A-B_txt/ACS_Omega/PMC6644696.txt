To
search for new ligands suitable for the separation of minor
actinides (MA) from lanthanides (Ln) in nuclear waste reprocessing,
theoretical (density functional theory) studies were carried out on
the complexation (structures, bonding, and thermodynamics) of La3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, and Am3+ complexes
with moderately soft donor ligands TPEN [N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine]
and PPDEN [N,N,N′,N″,N″-pentakis(2-pyridylmethyl)
diethylenetriamine] in aqueous and nitrobenzene solutions. B3LYP level
of theory was used in conjunction with the conductor-like screening
model for real systems (COSMO-RS). The metal ions in [M(NO3)2(TPEN)]NO3 and [M(NO3)(PPDEN)](NO3)2 complexes were deca-coordinated with both TPEN
and PPDEN. The enthalpy of the complexation with TPEN in an aqueous
solution was found to be negative, indicating the exothermic nature
of the reaction as observed in the experiments. The calculated values
of free energy of complexation follow the experimental trend: Am3+ > Sm3+ > La3+. Furthermore,
the calculated
free energy with PPDEN is reduced compared to that with TPEN, which
may be attributed to the ligand straining during complex formation,
which is also reflected in greater residual charges on both the Eu3+ and Am3+ central ions in the complexes of octadentate
PPDEN compared to hexadentate TPEN. The experimental complexation
selectivity of Am3+ over Eu3+ with TPEN is established
by employing COSMO-RS. Furthermore, TPEN is Am3+-selective,
whereas PPDEN is Eu3+-selective, which could be exploited
for the efficient separation of MA from Ln.

1 Introduction
There
is a continuing endeavor in the search of an appropriate
ligand molecule for the separation of lanthanides (Ln) from actinides
in nuclear waste reprocessing using liquid–liquid extraction.1,2 To reduce the radiotoxicity, it is mandatory to perform the partitioning
followed by transmutation of long-lived actinides, which requires
the separation of actinides from Ln.3 The
separation of the minor actinides (MA) from Ln is a major challenge
in nuclear waste reprocessing because of the chemical similarities
between Ln and actinides, which makes the separation very exigent.
Recently, heterocyclic ligands with moderately soft N atoms, which
show higher affinity for the actinides, are tested and used for the
separation of actinides and Ln.4−6 Among those synthesized and tested
are: tridentate 2,6-bis(1,2,4-triazine-3yl)pyridine (BTP), quadridentate
6,6-bis(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)-2,2-bipyridine ligands (BTBPs), 2,9-bis(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)-1,10-phenanthraline
(BTPhen), and hexadentate TPEN [N,N,N,N-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine].7−11 The process of MA recovery comprised two steps: the concurrent removal
of Ln and MA from high-level liquid waste, followed by the separation
of MA from Ln. Though the use of extractants like carbamoylmethylphosphine
oxide or tetraoctyl diglycolamide is ascertained in the first step,
an appropriate ligand for the second step is yet to be established,
and there is an ongoing search to pick up the suitable one. The exploration
for suitable ligands with soft donor atoms for the separation of MA
from Ln is a contemporary area of research, as ligands with soft donor
atoms, such as nitrogen and sulfur, have the preferable affinity toward
MA. Researchers in the European countries are working with the nitrogen
donor-based BTP, whereas researchers in China and USA are involved
in the research with sulfur-based Cyanex 301. However, both these
extractants have a serious disadvantage—their low chemical
stability. Recently, attention has been focused on a hexadentate ligand
called TPEN7−11 because of its high chemical stability and nongeneration of secondary
wastes by incineration, as this ligand consists of C, H, O, and N
atoms, merely. The maximum separation factor SFAm–Eu was shown to be 200 [with 1 mM TPEN at pH 4 in nitrobenzene (NB)–water],
which is significantly higher than those reported previously from
the DTPA processes12 and thus shows promise
in nuclear waste remediation. However, there are some demerits also––TPEN
has a considerable aqueous phase solubility, and its extraction ability
is greatly reduced at an acidic pH, that is, pH < 2. Nevertheless,
there is a scope of improvement by tailoring the molecule to address
the solubility and pH tolerance.

Parallel to the experimental
studies, plentiful theoretical studies13−20 have been performed to understand the actinide–Ln selectivity
through the molecular-level insights by studying the structure, bonding,
interaction, and thermodynamics of the metal ligand in the gas as
well as in the solution phase. Though theoretical studies have been
reported for BTP,21 BTBP,22−25 BTPhen,26 and others,16,17,27,28 the theoretical
understanding of complexation of TPEN with An/Ln has just begun.29 TPEN is a hexanitrogen donor, which is basically
a 2-pyridylmethyl analogue of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, H4EDTA. Recently,29 the complexation
of TPEN with An/Ln has been reported using a gas-phase optimized geometry,
followed by a single-point energy calculation employing the conductor-like
screening model (COSMO), a solvation model, but investigation on TPEN
and PPDEN [N,N,N,N,N-pentakis(2-pyridylmethyl)diethylenetriamine]
(Chart 1) for the complexation
selectivity of MA and Ln using the COSMO-real systems (COSMO-RS) model
has not been reported. The tolerance of TPEN at high acidity by introducing a suitable
group to the pyridine rings was discussed.29 Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the complexation
of the hexadentate TPEN with Ln and actinides using density functional
theory (DFT) with a higher level of solvation model like COSMO-RS
and comparison with COSMO. Additionally, a higher derivative of TPEN
with eight N donors, namely PPDEN, has been newly designed to impart
hydrophobicity and has been investigated for its complexation ability
and selectivity. Many similar theoretical studies were performed so
far using the gas-phase optimized geometry, followed by the single-point
energy calculation in solution.14−28 Also, most of the reported results used the gas-phase entropy,14−28 though it is known that the entropy in solution differs considerably
from that in the gas phase. In view of this, all the calculations
were performed with the structures optimized in the solvent, and the
thermodynamic parameters were also calculated for the solvent phase,
using the novel COSMO-RS model.

Chart 1 Structure of the Studied Ligands
2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural Parameters
A reasonable
structure of a chemical species is very important for further energetic
calculations. Hence, the various chemical species involved in the
present study are optimized, and the calculated results are compared
with the reported literature and the available experimental results.
As most of the chemical reactions take place in solution and metal
ions remain strongly hydrated, first, the hydrated metal ions are
optimized.

2.1.1 Microhydrated Metal Ions
All the
metal ions studied here were taken to be nonahydrated, as reported
in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiments.30,31 The minimum-energy structures using both the COSMO and COSMO-RS
approaches of the hydrated clusters of La3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, and Am3+ are displayed in Figure S1, and the calculated structural parameters
are presented in Table S1. The average
M–O distances using both COSMO-RS and COSMO were found to be
in fair agreement with the experimentally determined values using
EXAFS spectroscopy30,31 as well as the earlier computed
results32−34 (see Table S1). Overall,
the calculated average bond distance was found to follow the increasing
trend: Eu3+ < Sm3+ < Am3+ <
La3+ as per the experimental findings and thus confirms
the acceptance of the present computation method, which is subsequently
used for the study of the complexes of TPEN and PPDEN in the next
section. It is noted that the calculated M–O distances using COSMO-RS are always longer than that using COSMO.35,36

2.1.2 Equilibrium Structure of TPEN and PPDEN
The optimized geometries of the free TPEN and PPDEN ligands using
the COSMO-RS approach are displayed in Figure 1a,b whereas the COSMO-optimized structures
are shown in Figure S2. From the calculated
structural parameters, it is seen that the optimized structures using
both COSMO and COSMO-RS are nearly identical. In TPEN, there are four
donor “N” atoms from the four pyridine units and two
donor “N” atoms from the ethylene diamine linker, thus
making it act as a hexadentate ligand, whereas, in case of PPDEN,
there are five donor “N” atoms from the five pyridine
units and three donor “N” atoms from the diethylene
triamine linker, making it an octadentate. From Figure 1, it is seen that all the donor atoms are
not in the same plane or in the same direction. The calculated values
of the C–C (1.53 Å) and C–N (1.46 Å) bond
lengths of the amine chain of PPDEN were seen to be very close to
the experimental results of 1.53 and 1.468 Å, respectively.37

Figure 1 Optimized structures of free (a) TPEN and (b) PPDEN ligands
using
the COSMO-RS approach.

2.1.3 Equilibrium Structures of the Complexes
of Metal Ions with TPEN in Water
The optimized structures
of the La3+–TPEN complex, [La(NO3)2(TPEN)]NO3, using both COSMO and COSMO-RS are displayed
in Figure 2, whereas
those of the complexes of Sm3+, Eu3+, and Am3+ are displayed in Figures S3–S5. The calculated bond parameters are listed in Table S2. The coordination about the central metal is that
of a bicapped square antiprism (coordination number 10) with six nitrogen
atoms from one TPEN and two pairs of oxygen atoms from the bidentate
NO3– ions. One uncoordinated NO3– anion remains in the outer sphere to satisfy
charge neutrality. From Figure 2, it is seen that four donor “N” atoms from
the four pyridine units and two donor “N” atoms from
ethylene diamine are coordinated to the central metal ion in the first
sphere of coordination. In the case of the COSMO-RS-optimized structure,
the average La/Sm–Npy distance was found to be 2.770/2.692
Å, whereas the average La/Sm–Namine distance
was found to be 2.765/2.695 Å. The calculated La/Sm–N
distance was found to be very close to the X-ray experimental bond
distance of 2.72/2.636 Å.33,38 The average La/Sm–ONO3 bond length was found to be 2.727/2.595 Å
as against the X-ray-determined value of 2.587 Å. The average
Eu/Am–Npy distance was found to be 2.695/2.705 Å,
whereas the Eu/Am–Namine distance was found to be
2.695 Å. The average Eu/Am–ONO3 bond
length was found to be 2.580/2.612 Å. Recently,29 the average Eu/Am–Npy and Eu/Am–Namine distance for the charged [M(TPEN)(NO3)2]+ species in the gas phase at the M06-2X/6-31g(d)/RECP
level of theory was reported to be 2.698/2.675 and 2.788/2.788 Å,
respectively. The present results cannot be directly compared with
the reported data29 because of the differences
in the method of calculation as well as charge. It is noted that the
various M–L bond distances of the Am ion were little longer
than that of the Eu ion, indicating its more covalent nature.39 It is worth mentioning that the M–N bond
distances using COMS-RS are found to be shorter than that using COSMO,
whereas the M–O bond distances using COSMO-RS are found to
be longer than that using COSMO (see Figure 2a).

TPEN in the presence of nitrate ions using (a) COSMO and (b) COSMO-RS
approaches.

2.1.4 Equilibrium
Structure of Complexes of Metal
Ions with PPDEN in Water
The optimized minimum-energy structures
of the complexes of Eu3+ ion with PPDEN using both COSMO
and COSMO-RS are displayed in Figure 3 whereas those of the complexes of Am3+ are
shown in Figure S6. The calculated bond
length parameters are listed in Table S3.

Figure 3 Optimized structures of the complexes of Eu3+ with PPDEN
ligand in the presence of nitrate ions using the COSMO and COSMO-RS
approaches.

The central metal ion
was seen to be coordinated to eight N donor
atoms of PPDEN and two donor atoms of the NO3– anion in a bidentate mode, leading to a deca-coordinated complex
in both the COSMO and COSMO-RS structures. The average Eu/Am–Npy was found to be 2.754/2.778 Å, whereas the Eu/Am–Namine length was found to be 2.863/2.826 Å. The average
Eu/Am–ONO3– was found
to be 2.55/2.60 Å, much shorter than the Eu/Am–N bond
length. For the COSMO-RS structure, the average Eu/Am–Npy was found to be 2.772/2.764 Å, whereas the Eu/Am–Namine bond length was found to be 2.83/2.88 Å. The average
Eu/Am–ONO3 bond length was found to be
2.58/2.62 Å. The bond length predicted using COSMO-RS was seen
to be little longer than that predicted using COSMO, except for the
Eu/Am–Npy length. It is worth mentioning that the
calculated bond length of the Eu–PPDEN complex is longer than
that of the Eu–TPEN complex, perhaps because of the ligand
straining during complexation. Further, the calculated M–O
bond length using COSMO-RS is seen to be slightly longer than that
using COSMO. The various M–L bond distances for the Am ion
were seen to be longer than that of the Eu ion, as observed with TPEN.
It is noted that the complex of Eu3+ ion with PPDEN has
been reported but could not be compared because of the lack of access
to the published data.40 To calculate the
aqueous–organic (NB) biphasic metal ion selectivity, free TPEN
and its complexes with the Eu3+ and Am3+ ions
in the presence of nitrate co-anions were further reoptimized in NB.
The optimized structures of the complexes with TPEN using both COSMO
and COSMO-RS are displayed in Figures S7a,b and S8a,b. The calculated structural parameters are given in Table S4. There were no significant changes in
the optimized structures in NB. From the overall structural analysis,
it is observed that the various structural parameters of the hydrated
metal ion and metal ion complexes are in fair agreement with the available
experimental results and thus confirm the acceptance of the computational
protocol used in this study.

2.2 Thermodynamics
2.2.1 Hydration Free Energy of the Metal Ions
The accurate
free energy of hydration, ΔGhyd,
for a metal ion is very important to determine the
metal ion–ligand complexation ability as well as for the correct
prediction of the metal-ion selectivity. The ΔGhyd values for all the metal ions have been calculated
using both COSMO and COSMO-RS, and the values are presented in Table S5. The calculated ΔGhyd of the La3+, Sm3+, and Eu3+ ions with COSMO-RS is in good agreement with the experimental
results41,42 compared to COSMO. It is to be noted that
though the value of ΔGhyd of La3+ using COSMO-RS is little lower than that reported from CCSD,43 it is quite better than the value calculated
with MP2,32,42 BP86,31 and B3LYP.31 The value of ΔGhyd of the Sm3+ ion using COSMO-RS is better than that reported
from CCSD,43 MP2,32,44 BP86,32 and earlier-reported B3LYP.32 For the Eu3+ ion, the value ΔGhyd by COSMO-RS is better than that reported
from MP2,32,44 BP86,32 and B3LYP.34 The calculated ΔGhyd of Am3+ with COSMO and COSMO-RS was found to
be −779.39 and −793.57 kcal/mol, respectively. Unfortunately,
there are no experimental results available for ΔGhyd of the Am3+ ion. Therefore, the value was
compared with the reported theoretical results. Here, the value calculated
using COSMO-RS is in good agreement with the value reported from CCSD45 and quite better than the value reported using
BP86,46 B3LYP,47 and semiempirically.47 Finally, the results
shown in Table S5 indicate that our computed
(B3LYP) values of ΔΔGhyd(ΔGhyd,Eu – ΔGhyd,Am) (−21.6 kcal/mol) using COSMO-RS is in excellent
agreement with the recently reported results (−21.13 kcal/mol).20 From the overall analysis, it is seen that COSMO-RS
in combination with B3LYP performs better than COSMO and the other
reported theoretical results. This further assures the acceptance
of the adopted computational methodology here and is thus used in
the calculation of the complexation free energy, which is used for
the analysis of the stability constant.

2.2.2 Enthalpy
and Free Energy of Metal–Ligand
Complexation in Water
After obtaining the reasonable structures,
we deal with the thermodynamic functions to evaluate the stability
of the metal ion–ligand complexes in aqueous solution. The
relative stability of the complexes will help in understanding the
ability of the extractants to be used in the extraction experiments.
Earlier, the stability of Ln/An with TPEN has been reported experimentally
by measuring the enthalpy and free energy in aqueous solution. Therefore,
the thermodynamical enthalpy and free energy of the complexes in aqueous
solution have been determined using both COSMO and COSMO-RS.

2.2.3 M3+–TPEN System
The enthalpies of
the complexation reactions for La3+,
Sm3+, Eu3+, and Am3+ with TPEN in
aqueous solution using both the COSMO and COSMO-RS approaches are
presented in Table 1. The complexation enthalpy was found to be negative, indicating
the exothermic nature of the reaction as observed in experiments.48 The point to be noted is that the complexation
enthalpy calculated using the COSMO approach follows the experimental
trend: Am3+ > Sm3+ > La3+,
whereas
the COSMO-RS approach predicts the trend as Am3+ > La3+ > Sm3+, which does not match the experimental
selectivity.

The free energy of complexation for La3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, and Am3+ with TPEN
in aqueous solution
using both the COSMO and COSMO-RS approaches is presented in Table 1. In the case of both
the COSMO and COSMO-RS approaches, the calculated value of the free
energy of complexation follows the trend: Am3+ > Sm3+ > La3+, as predicted in the experiment. Overall,
the combination of B3LYP and COSMO-RS is thus confirmed as an appropriate
computational protocol for determining the complexation stability
of Ln/An with TPEN by calculating the free energy of complexation.

2.2.4 M–(NO3)3–PPDEN
System
After the above successful demonstration for establishing
the experimental complexation stability, our next aim is to test the
complexation stability for the higher derivative of TPEN, that is,
PPDEN having a higher denticity of 8 “N” donor atoms.
The complexation enthalpy of the Eu3+ and Am3+ ions with PPDEN using both COSMO and COSMO-RS is displayed in Table 2. From the table,
it is seen that the calculated value of complexation enthalpy of the
Am3+ ion with PPDEN using the COSMO solvation model is
slightly higher than that of the Eu3+ ion.

a cal/(mol·K).

After the inclusion of positive
entropy contribution, the free
energy of complexation becomes more exergonic, but the value is seen
to be higher for the Eu3+ ion over the Am3+ ion.
A similar trend was also noticed with TPEN using COSMO.

Further,
the complexation enthalpy was evaluated using the COSMO-RS
solvation model (Table 2). The complexation enthalpy was exergonic, which after the inclusion
of positive entropy contribution becomes more exergonic. Here also,
the complexation free energy for the Eu3+ ion was higher
than that of the Am3+ ion, which is reversed compared to
that observed toward TPEN using COSMO-RS. Furthermore, the calculated
free energy with PPDEN is reduced compared to that with TPEN, though
PPDEN has a greater denticity (8) than TPEN (6). Therefore, it can
be stated that the increased denticity does not always lead to a higher
interaction/free energy. A similar reduction in interaction energy
with increasing denticity for rare earths with diglycolamide was earlier
reported as a manifestation of ligand strain energy.49 In view of this, ligand strain energies (ΔEstrain) were calculated for both TPEN and PPDEN
and are presented in Figure 4. The ΔEstrain value was
calculated by taking the difference of the total energy of the free
ligand and that of the same configuration as in the complex, but after
removing the metal ion and anion(s), followed by a single point energy
calculation using the COSMO-RS solvation model. The calculated value
of ΔEstrain for TPEN (25.88 kcal/mol)
was found to be much smaller than that of PPDEN (61.23 kcal/mol) and
thus suggesting reduced interaction energy compared to TPEN. The higher ΔEstrain for PPDEN compared to TPEN is understandable
from the internitrogen distance in the free ligand compared to the
organized ligand in the metal ion complex (Figure 4). The internitrogen distance in free PPDEN
is much higher than that in TPEN (see Figure 4), and hence ΔEstrain is also much higher than that for TPEN. Also, the cavity
of PPDEN was seen to be larger than that of TPEN, as revealed from Figure S9, which resulted in a longer metal-ion–ligand
bond distance for PPDEN than TPEN, and hence a smaller interaction
energy was observed for PPDEN. It is worth noting that not only the
free energy is reduced, but selectivity is also reversed. The difference
in strain energies, ΔΔEstrain (=ΔEstrain,Eu – ΔEstrain,Am), for TPEN (2.29 kcal/mol) was found
to be reduced to 1.73 kcal/mol for PPDEN, indicating the possible
role of strain energy in reversing the TPEN/PPDEN selectivity. In
the next section, the bonding analysis has been performed to find
out the other probable reasons for the reduction in the free energy
of complexation from TPEN to PPDEN.

of the metal ion and anion (right) from the respective complexes.

2.3 Bonding
Analysis
To obtain better
molecular insights in the nature of bonding of Eu/Am with TPEN and
PPDEN, natural population analysis (NPA)50,51 was carried out on various chemical species using both COSMO and
COSMO-RS.

2.3.1 Metal Ion–TPEN Complexes
The residual charge calculated by performing NPA on the TPEN complex
of Eu ion was found to be the lowest, whereas it was the highest with
the Sm ion, though the difference is very minute (Table 3).

The complexation and the nature of
the M3+–ligand
bonding can be concluded from the partial atomic charge on the metal
ions and from the electron population in the s, d, and f orbitals
of the metal ions in the complexes. The electron populations in the
atomic orbitals of the TPEN and PPDEN ligands and their complexes
with the Am3+ and Eu3+ cations in water are
presented in Table S6. The covalent nature
of bonding is characterized by the amplification of the electron population
in the s, d, and f orbitals of the metal ions subsequent to complexation.
There is hardly any difference in the electron population of the metal
ion complexes obtained from the COSMO and COSMO-RS models.

The
LUMO–HOMO energy gaps (LHGs) of TPEN and hydrated metal
ions were determined to get a better disclosure of the molecular-level
interactions, and the computed values are presented in Table 4. Figure 5 depicts the distribution of the highest
occupied molecular orbitals(HOMO) and the lowest occupied molecular orbitals(LUMO) of TPEN in
water and NB. The identical nature of HOMO and LUMO of TPEN in water
and NB leads to close values of LHGs, indicating weak solvent dependency.

The high values of ELUMO–HOMO, χ, and η indicate the hard nature
of metal ions. Though
the hydrated Eu3+ ion was found to be harder than that
of the hydrated Am3+ ion, the interaction energy of the
Am3+ ion with TPEN was found to be higher over the Eu3+ ion. Further, the distribution of HOMO and LUMO of the complexes
of Eu and Am with TPEN in water and NB is depicted in Figure 6 to realize a better understanding
about the type of bonding. From the figure, it is seen that though
the distribution of HOMO and LUMO of the complexes of Eu in water
and NB are found to be similar, their LHGs are different. The LHG
in water is found to be quite higher than that in NB, whereas in case
of Am, though the distribution of LUMO is identical in water and NB,
the distribution of HOMO is quite dissimilar. The HOMO in water is
widely distributed over the ions and ligands, whereas in NB, it is
over the nitrate ion only, as observed for Eu. The point to be noted
is that for all the cases, the same isosurface value of 0.011 (e·bohr–3) has been used.

Figure 6 Distribution of the HOMO and LUMO of the
complexes of Eu and Am
with TPEN in water and NB.

It is worth mentioning that the distribution of HOMO and
LUMO of
free TPEN in water and NB is very similar, which leads to a very close
value of LHG, whereas in the complexes, the LHG is substantial, indicating
the role of the metal orbital making the difference. Further, the
distribution of LUMO and HOMO over the metal ion confirms the participation
of the f orbital of the metal ions. The extent of interaction of Eu
and Am with TPEN is also reflected from the different values of LHG
in water and NB. The LHG for the hydrated Am ion is smaller than that
for the hydrated Eu ion, indicating that the Am ion is softer than
the Eu ion, which perhaps resulted in a higher interaction energy
for Am over the Eu ion. Furthermore, the amount of charge transfer,
ΔN, was also determined for the metal ion–ligand
acceptor donor interaction, and the calculated values are given in Table 4. It is worth noting
that the calculated large ion–ligand interaction energy (ΔU) as well as the higher interaction of the Eu3+ ion over the Am3+ ion cannot be correlated with the higher
amount of charge transfer, ΔN, with the Eu3+ ion than with the Am3+ ion. The point to be noted
is that the value of ΔN predicted using COSMO-RS
is slightly smaller than that obtained using COSMO. In the case of
COSMO-RS, though the charge transfer, ΔN, was
estimated to be higher with Eu3+ ion than that with Am3+ ion, the value of (ΔU) was found
to be higher with Am3+ ion over that with Eu3+ ion and hence cannot be correlated. Further, the charge on the donor
“N” atom of pyridine and ethylene amine is calculated
employing both COSMO and COSMO-RS, and the calculated results are
presented in Table 5.

From the table,
it is noticed that the partial charge on the N
atoms of the pyridine moieties, higher than that on the N atoms of
the ethylene amine chain, indicates the stronger complexation of the
metal cations by the Npy than that by the Neth-amine atoms. The partial charge on the “N” donor in free
TPEN as well as in the metal ion complexes using COSMO-RS was found
to be slightly higher than that using COSMO. The augmentation of charge
on the donor “N” atoms after complexation indicates
a strong ion–dipole interaction. Npy and Neth-amine atoms in the coordinated TPEN (Table 5) molecules are more negative than those in the respective
free molecules. This is not unusual and has earlier been reported
for the terdendate nitrogen planar ligands52 and may be attributed to the withdrawal of electron density from
the less negative carbon atoms of the ligands to the more negative
N atoms (see Table S6). Note that the sum
of the partial charges on all the atoms is zero.

2.3.2 Metal Ion–PPDEN Complexes
The residual charge
on the PPDEN complex of Eu ion was found to be
smaller than that of the Am ion, though the difference is very small
(Table 6). The residual
charge on the metal ion in the COSMO approach is very close to that
in the COSMO-RS approach. The residual charge on both the Eu and Am
ions in the complexes of octadentate PPDEN was found to be increased
compared to that of the hexa-dentate TPEN, indicating a reduced interaction
with PPDEN over TPEN. There is hardly any difference in the electron
population of the metal ion complexes obtained from COSMO and COSMO-RS.

The LHG of PPDEN was
determined to obtain a better understanding
about the molecular-level interaction, and the calculated values are
given in Table 7. Figure 7 depicts the dispersal
of HOMO and LUMO of PPDEN in water and NB. The values of LHG of PPDEN
are similar in water and NB because of the identical nature of HOMO
and LUMO. From the figure, it is seen that though the distribution of HOMO
and LUMO of PPDEN in water and NB is quite identical, LHG has been
reduced compared to that of TPEN.

Further, the distribution of HOMO and LUMO
of the complexes of
Eu and Am with PPDEN in water and NB is depicted in Figure 7 to have a better understanding
about the type of bonding. From the figure, it is noticed that the
nature of the HOMO and LUMO of the complexes of Eu in water and NB
is not only found to be comparable, but their LHGs are almost matching
as noticed in the case of free TPEN, whereas in the case of Am, though
the distribution of LUMO and HOMO is identical in water and NB, their
LHGs are dissimilar. The LHG in water is found to be quite higher
than that in NB. It is worth noting that the distribution of HOMO
and LUMO of free PPDEN in water and NB is very similar, leading to
equal LHGs, whereas in the complexes, the LHG has been substantially
reduced indicating the role of metal orbital which makes the difference.
Further, the distribution of LUMO and HOMO over the metal ion confirms
the participation of the f orbital of metal ions. The extent of interaction
of Eu and Am with PPDEN is also reflected from the different values
of LHG in water and NB. The high values of ELUMO–HOMO, χ, and η indicate the hard nature
of all the metal ions studied here. Though the hydrated Eu3+ ion was found to be harder than the hydrated Am3+ ion,
the interaction energy of the Eu3+ ion with PPDEN was found
to be higher than that of the Am3+ ion when the COSMO solvation
model is employed. Furthermore, the amount of charge transfer, ΔN, was also determined for the metal ion–ligand acceptor
donor interaction, and the calculated values are given in Table 7. It is worth noting
that the calculated large ion–ligand interaction energy can
be well-correlated with the higher amount of charge transfer, ΔN, but could not be correlated with the higher interaction
of the Am3+ ion over that of the Eu3+ ion. It
is noted that the value of ΔN predicted using
COSMO-RS is slightly smaller than that obtained using COSMO solvation.
However, in case of COSMO-RS, the estimated charge transfer, ΔN, as well as the interaction energy, ΔU, was shown to be higher with the Eu3+ ion than that with
the Am3+ ion and is well-correlated.

Further, the
charge on the donor “N” atom of pyridine
and ethylene amine in PPDEN and the metal ion complex is calculated
employing both COSMO and COSMO-RS, and the calculated results are
presented in Table 8. From the table, it is noticed that the partial charge on the donor
“N” atom within the pyridine was found to be higher
than that with the ethylene “N” donor, indicating a
strong interaction with the pyridine “N” over the ethylene
“N” as observed with TPEN. The partial charge on the
“N” donor in free PPDEN as well as in the metal ion
complexes using COSMO-RS was found to be close to that using COSMO
solvation. As in TPEN, the Npy and Neth-amine atoms in the coordinated PPDEN (Table 8) molecules are more negative than the respective
free ligand, which might be due to the withdrawal of electron density
from the less negative carbon atoms of the ligands to the more negative
N atoms (see Table S6).

Overall, from the population
and LUMO–HOMO analyses, the
interaction of PPDEN is found to be smaller than that of TPEN, and
also different ionic, covalent, and ion–dipole type bondings
were revealed. From the analysis, TPEN was shown to be harder than
PPDEN.

The reactivity of the TPEN and PPDEN ligands because
of their different
denticities can also be well-depicted by the molecular electrostatic
potential (MEP). The MEP is very useful as an indicator of the sites
of a ligand molecule to which an approaching ionic species is complexed.
In view of this, we have calculated the MEPs of TPEN and PPDEN at
the B3LYP/TZP level of theory using the ADF suite of package53,54 and depicted in Figure 8. The MEP clearly reveals the different charge distributions
of TPEN and PPDEN because of their different denticities.

Figure 8 MEPs of TPEN
and PPDEN at the B3LYP/TZ2P level of theory.

Moreover, the bonding character of the complexes of Am3+ and Eu3+ with TPEN was studied by evaluating
the energy
levels of the MOs at the B3LYP/TZ2P/ZORA level of theory. The MO diagrams
of LUMO, LUMO + 1, HOMO, and HOMO – 1 for the α-spin
valence of the metal–ligand bonding for the [TPEN–M]3+ complexes (an isosurface value of 0.017 a.u. was used) are
shown in Figure 9.
From the analysis of MOs, it is seen that there is no participation
of the f orbital of Eu in HOMO, whereas the participation of the f
orbital of Am in HOMO was observed.

valence MOs of

level of theory.

2.4 Selectivity
of Eu3+ and Am3+ Toward TPEN/PPDEN in Biphasic
(Water–NB) Extraction
After establishing the complexation
stability and bonding mechanism,
our next attempt is to exploit this behavior for preferential partitioning
of Eu and Am with TPEN/PPDEN using liquid–liquid extraction.
In view of the higher complexation free energy of Am3+ with
TPEN over Ln in aqueous solution, it will be worthwhile to investigate
whether TPEN can be used for the partitioning of actinides (Am) from
Ln (Eu) in biphasic solvent extraction experiments. For this, the
biphasic extraction reaction can be modeled as 1  

The free energy of extraction, ΔGext, for the above complexation reaction has
been evaluated using the earlier reported method,55−60 and the values are presented in Table 9. In Table 9, the value of ΔG was determined
using the COSMO solvation model. Further, the selectivity between
the Am3+ ion and the Eu3+ ion is determined
using the difference in the free energy of extraction, ΔΔG = ΔGext,Am –
ΔGext,Eu.

a cal/(mol·K).

The negative ΔG value indicates that the
ligand is Am-selective and positive ΔG value
means Eu-selective. In case of TPEN, the value of ΔGext for Eu3+ ion was found to be slightly higher
than that of Am3+ ion by 0.38 kcal/mol, and with PPDEN,
the value of ΔGext was found to
be favorable by 2.05 kcal/mol for Eu3+ ion over Am3+ ion. From the calculated values of ΔGext, both TPEN and PPDEN were shown to be Eu3+ ion-selective over Am3+ ion when the COSMO solvation
model was used, which contradicts the preferential selectivity of
the Eu3+ ion over the Am3+ ion, as observed
in the experiments (DAm = 2.0 and DEu = 0.0099).7,8 The calculated
value of ΔGext using COSMO-RS is
also presented in Table 9. From the calculated values of ΔGext, it is seen that with TPEN, the value of ΔGext for the Am3+ ion was found to be higher
than that of the Eu3+ ion by 4.5 kcal/mol, indicating that
TPEN is selective for Am3+ ion over Eu3+ ion,
as observed in the experiments (DAm =
2.0 and DEu = 0.0099),7,8 whereas
with PPDEN, the value of ΔGext was
found to be favorable by 5.42 kcal/mol for Eu3+ ion over
Am3+ ion, predicting PPDEN is Eu3+ ion-selective.
From the value of ΔGext, TPEN was
found to be Am3+ ion-selective over Eu3+ ion,
and PPDEN was shown to be Eu3+ ion-selective when the COSMO-RS
solvation model was employed. Note that the calculated value of ΔΔGAm–Eu (−4.5 kcal/mol) for TPEN
in NB using COSMO-RS was found to be very close to the earlier reported
value of −5.1 kcal/mol29 at the
M06-2X/6-31g(d)/RECP level of theory, although the type of complex
was [M–TPEN–(NO3)2].

The
point to be noted is that the binding energy, ΔU, for both the metal ions with both TPEN and PPDEN was
found to be reduced for COSMO-RS over the COSMO model substantially.
This might be due to the calculated M–O bond length using COSMO-RS,
which is seen to be slightly longer than that using COSMO, as longer
the bond length, smaller is the interaction. From the value of ΔU, both TPEN and PPDEN were found to be Am3+-selective
using the COSMO model, but Am3+-selective for TPEN and
Eu3+-selective for PPDEN using the COSMO-RS model. After
the inclusion of entropy, both TPEN and PPDEN were found to be Eu3+-selective using the COSMO model, whereas TPEN remains Am3+-selective and PPDEN remains Eu3+-selective using
the COSMO-RS model. Anticipating that the COSMO-RS model is more accurate
over the COSMO model because of its superior functionality by taking
care of the structure of the solvents, one might conclude that TPEN
is Am3+-selective, whereas PPDEN is Eu3+-selective,
which might be due to the steric denticity of PPDEN than that of TPEN.
This contrasting selectivity of TPEN and PPDEN can be exploited for
the partitioning of Eu3+ and Am3+ in the nuclear
waste reprocessing. Finally, the predictability of the COSMO-RS-enabled
DFT calculation can be confirmed by performing the calculation at
a higher level of theory or by synthesizing a new PPDEN ligand followed
by experimental evaluation. It is noted that a similar computational
study for the complexation of Eu and Am with TPEN using DFT/COSMO
was recently reported by Huang et al.29 with the theoretical selectivity of Am over Eu as observed in the
present study at the B3LYP/TZVP level of theory in conjunction with
COSMO-RS.

3 Conclusions
The
enthalpy of the complexation reaction for metal ions with TPEN
and PPDEN in aqueous solution was found to be negative, indicating
the exothermic nature of the reaction as observed in the experiments.
The calculated value of the complexation enthalpy of the Eu3+ ion with PPDEN is slightly higher than that of the Am3+ ion. The point to be noted is that the complexation free energy
of the Eu3+ ion was higher than that of the Am3+ ion with PPDEN, which is opposite to that with TPEN using COSMO-RS.
Furthermore, the calculated free energy with PPDEN is reduced compared
to that with TPEN. This may be due to the higher ligand straining
for PPDEN than for TPEN. Therefore, it can be concluded that the increased
denticity always does not lead to more negative free energy. It is
worth mentioning that the free energy with PPDEN is reduced and selectivity
is reversed.

The partial charge on the N atoms of the pyridine
moieties, higher
than that on the N atoms of the ethylene amine chain, indicates a
stronger complexation of the metal cations by Npy than
by the Neth-amine atoms. The increased partial charge
on the donor “N” atoms reveals the strong ion–dipole
interaction. The residual charge on the Eu/Am ions in the complexes
of PPDEN was higher compared to that of TPEN, indicating a reduced
interaction with PPDEN than that with TPEN. Further, the covalent
nature of bonding is manifested by the greater electron population
in the s, d, and f orbitals of metal ions after complexation.

Anticipating that the COSMO-RS model is more accurate over the
COSMO model (demonstrated for metal ion hydration free energy with
COSMO-RS) because of its superior functionality by taking care of
the structure of the solvents, one might conclude that TPEN is Am3+-selective, whereas PPDEN is Eu3+-selective, which
might be due to the higher ligand straining with PPDEN than that with
TPEN. Thus, the contrasting selectivity of TPEN and PPDEN might be
exploited for the effective partitioning of the Eu3+ and
Am3+ ions from the high-level nuclear waste. Finally, the
predictability of the COSMO-RS-enabled DFT calculations needs further
investigation, either by performing the calculation at a higher level
of theory or by experiments using PPDEN. Work in this direction is
in progress in our computational and experimental molecular engineering
laboratory.

4 Computational Methodology
The hydrated
clusters of trivalent Ln (La3+, Sm3+, and Eu3+) and actinides (Am3+), TPEN
and PPDEN ligands, and their metal nitrate complexes have been optimized
in the aqueous and NB phases at the B3LYP level of theory61,62 using the TZVP basis set63,64 as available in the
electronic structure calculation program of Turbomole,65−67 that is, C (11s6p1d)/[5s3p1d], N (11s6p1d)/[5s3p1d], O (11s6p1d)/[5s3p1d],
and H (5s1p)/[3s1p] and the SVP basis set, that is, La (7s6p5d)/[6s3p2d],
Sm (14s13p10d8f1g)/[10s8p5d4f1g], Eu (14s13p10d8f1g)/[10s8p5d4f1g],
and Am (14s13p10d8f1g)/[10s9p5d4f1g]. In the case of La3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, and Am3+, an ECP core
potential was used, where 46 electrons are kept in the core of La68−70 and 28 electrons are kept in the core of Sm70 and Eu,71−73 respectively, whereas the number of core electrons
was 60 for the Am71−73 element. For other elements, all-electron basis set
was used.

The aqueous and NB phase effects were taken care by
invoking both
the COSMO74 and COSMO-RS75,76 solvation approaches.

The COSMO solvation model, which is
a simply dielectric continuum
model, does not take into account the microscopic configuration of
the solvents. To account the microscopic structure of the solvents,
a self-consistent module of COSMO-RS75,76 has been adopted,
where the sigma potential of individual solvents can be used. The
sigma potential captures the microscopic details of the solvents through
the surface charge density and has been computed here by performing
the D-COSMO-RS77,78 module as implemented in the
Turbomole program. The sigma potentials of water and NB, which are
needed for the COSMO-RS calculation, are depicted in Figure 10. The optimization of the
complexes with Sm3+, Eu3+, and Am3+ was performed using the doublet and septet spin-state, respectively.
There are numerous studies in the literature, where the B3LYP functional
has been used successfully for the calculations of the molecular properties
of high-spin Eu and Am systems.33,79−83

Figure 10 Sigma potential of H2O and NB used for the optimization
of structures, and the calculation of energy and frequency using COSMO-RS.

Hence, B3LYP was selected for
the calculations of the present Eu
and Am systems. The issue of degeneracy because of the spin is generally
checked by comparing the value of ⟨S2⟩ and S(S + 1). In the present
chemical system, the value of ⟨S2⟩ is observed to be very close to the S(S + 1) ideal values, which highly indicates that all the
chemical structures display negligible spin contamination. The vibrational
frequency was calculated using the numerical NumForce module of the
Turbomole. The default COSMO radii were used for all the elements
except La3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, and Am3+, for which the values of COSMO radii used were 2.03, 1.93,
1.90, and 1.99 Å, respectively.31,45 The dielectric
constants, ε, of 80 and 34.81 were used to represent the water
and NB environment, respectively. The computation of the solvation
free energy for the metal ions in water is performed using the cluster
water explicit solvation model.31,45

The complexation
reaction in the aqueous phase was modeled using
1:1 metal/ligand stoichiometry, as observed in the experiments, which
is given below32 2  

The zero-point energy corrected complexation energy for the
above
reaction can be written as 3  

The enthalpy of complexation, ΔHcomplx, is obtained by the following thermal corrections 4  Here, Δn is the change
in the number of moles between the products and reactants. The free
energy for the complexation reaction is determined as 5  where ΔS is the entropy
of complexation and T is the temperature. NPA50,51 was performed to understand the nature of bonding in the metal–ligand
complexes. Further, from the LUMO–HOMO analysis, the strength
of the M–L interaction can also be evaluated by the amount
of change transfer (ΔN),84 which can be calculated by eq 6 as 6  where χ
and η represent the absolute
electronegativity and absolute hardness of M or L, respectively, and
estimated as 7  where I and A correspond to the ionization potential
and electron affinity, respectively,
and can be obtained using Koopmans’ theorem85 as 8  where EHOMO and ELUMO are the energies
of the highest occupied
and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of M or L, respectively,
and can be determined from the DFT calculation.
