A simple,
practical, and rapid access to quinoxalin-2-ones 1, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines 2, quinoxalines 3, and quinoxalin-2(1H)-ones 4 has been achieved, based on the copper-catalyzed
quinoxalinone formation
of 2-haloanilines and amino acids followed by their reduction and
oxidation. The olfactory properties and lipid accumulation inhibitory
activity in cultured hepatocytes of the quinoxaline derivatives were
also evaluated.

Introduction
Quinoxaline and its
derivatives are important structural units
for the development of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional
materials (Figure 1).1 Some quinoxalines also have a pleasant
smell and savory properties.2 For instance,
5-methylquinoxaline is not only identified by its roasted coffee flavor
but also displays a nutty-type odor with a high odor intensity and
is utilized for a series of food products, such as coffee, nuts, meats,
and cocoa.2 Similarly, 2-methylquinoxaline
has been identified in roasted coffee. However, reports on the odors
of quinoxaline derivatives are still limited,2c and, therefore, the odors of many quinoxaline derivatives are unknown.
Moreover, quinoxaline derivatives are known to display a diverse range
of biological activities.1 On the basis
of recent reports,3−5 we predicted that the quinoxaline derivatives may
exert a liver-protective effect. Regarding the synthesis of the quinoxaline
derivatives, a significant amount of literature dealing with the synthesis
of quinoxaline derivatives has been published.1a,6 We
previously reported the synthesis of quinoxalin-2-ones 1 starting from 2-haloanilines and amino acids in the presence of
a copper catalyst.7 It was anticipated
that a series of quinoxaline congeners would be derived from the quinoxalin-2-ones 1 by employing simple manipulations such as reductions and
oxidations (Scheme 1). In this report, we demonstrate the synthesis of a series of quinoxaline
derivatives with different oxidation states, which include 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines 2, quinoxalines 3, and quinoxalin-2(1H)-ones 4 from quinoxalin-2-ones 1. Their olfactory properties and hepatic lipid accumulation inhibitory
activity using lipid-overloaded HepG2 hepatocytes were also evaluated.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
The syntheses of quinoxalinones
were performed
based on our previously reported procedure.7 The reactions of 2-bromoanilines with α-amino acids in the
presence of catalytic amounts of CuCl (5 mol %), DMEDA (40 mol %),
and K3PO4 (2 equiv) afforded the desired quinoxalinones 1 in moderate to excellent yields (Table 1). Quinoxalinones 1a, 1b, and 1k were synthesized for the first time
in this study. When 2-bromo-4,6-dimethylaniline was utilized as a
substrate, 1,2-dihydroquinoxaline 1k was produced instead
of the corresponding desired quinoxalinone.

Table 1 Synthesis
of Quinoxalinones and Their
Olfactory Properties
The conversions of quinoxalinones 1 to
1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines 2 were smoothly conducted
using excess lithium aluminum hydride
as the reducing agent (Table 2).8

Table 2 Conversions
of Quinoxalinones to 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroquinoxalines
and Their Olfactory Properties
The quinoxaline derivatives 3 were obtained
by the
oxidations of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines 2 with vanadium
(V) oxide.9 When (1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalin-2-yl)methanol 2j was applied under these conditions, aldehyde 3j was obtained in 11% yield. The N-methyl substrate 2i did not afford 1-methyl-1,2-dihydroquinoxaline 3i.

The pathway to quinoxalin-2(1H)-one has
been demonstrated
using quinoxalinones 1a and 1c as model
substrates (Scheme 2). Oxidation of quinoxalinones 1a and 1c with V2O5 provided quinoxalin-2(1H)-one 4a and 4c in 67 and 68% yields, respectively.
Unfortunately, the reductions of 4a and 4c to the corresponding 1,2-dihydroquinoxalines have not been successful.

Olfactory Properties
We next evaluated the olfactory
properties of the quinoxaline derivatives 1–3 synthesized in this study, which were performed by five
panelists (30–50-year-old men), including three flavorists,
by direct smelling from a sample tube. The results are listed in Table 1–3 under the structures of the compounds. Quinoxalines 3a–c and 3e were discovered
in nature2 and their olfactory properties
are already known; however, the other derivatives were evaluated for
the first time. It was found that quinoxalinones 1 tended
to have phenolic or medicine-like odors, although some of them have
chocolate- (1e and 1j) or cacaolike (1f) smells. We assume that this would be the case because
of the existence of a carbonyl group on the quinoxalinones 1. Some 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines 2 had odors of
food such as nutty (2a) and roasty (2b and 2e). Others had phenolic (2c and 2g), medicine-like (2d, 2f, and 2m), and fishy (2k) odors. Their odor qualities depended
on the number and position of the substituents and also their functional
groups. Generally, many 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines have a pungent
odor. Gratifyingly, the monomethyl-substituted quinoxalines have desirable
odors, such as coffeelike (3c), cookielike (3b), and roast chestnutlike (3e). On the other hand, the
dimethyl, ethyl, and formyl-substituted quinoxalines displayed a phenolic
(3d, 3g, and 3j) and smoky
odor (3f). Generally, quinoxalines 3 did
not display a pungent odor and had mild and desirable incenses. In
terms of each quinoxaline derivative, roasty (2a), peanutlike
(2e), cookielike (3b), coffeelike (3c), and roast chestnutlike odors (3e) have been
determined. These compounds have common structural units such as being
monomethyl substituted, especially, the 5-methyl-substituted quinoxaline.
The intensity levels of the odors of the quinoxaline derivatives synthesized
in this study were found to be as follows: quinoxalines 3 > tetrahydroquinoxalines 2 > quinoxalinones 1.

Olfactory Properties
Biological Activities
Recent research evidence has
demonstrated that the cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptor has therapeutic
value in terms of pain relief, inflammation, osteoporosis, treating
cancers, and hepatoprotection. The activation of the CB2 receptors
in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes has been reported to protect inflammatory
liver injury and attenuate liver steatosis in vitro and in vivo.3−5 In recent years, structurally diverse CB2-selective agonists exhibiting
an analgesic activity in various pain models have been discovered,
and Saari et al. have reported that the quinoxaline derivatives showed
a low-potency partial CB2 receptor agonist activity.3 Therefore, we predicted that the synthesized quinoxaline
derivatives may exert a liver-protective effect. We screened the synthesized
quinoxaline derivatives for lipid accumulation inhibitory activity
using lipid-overloaded HepG2 hepatocytes.5 The cells were exposed to 0.5 mM palmitate in the presence of each
synthesized quinoxaline derivative for 24 h; then the intracellular
neutral lipids were determined by Oil Red O staining. As shown in Figure 2A, we found that
some quinoxalinones 1 effectively prevent palmitate-induced
lipid accumulation in HepG2 hepatocytes. It is noteworthy that 8-methyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-quinoxalin-2-one (1a) and 3,6-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-quinoxalin-2-one (1f, 1m) showed
a marked decrease in lipid accumulation by about 50% compared to that
of the vehicle-treated control. In addition, tetrahydroquinoxalines 2a, 2e, 2i, and quinoxalines 3c and 3f slightly inhibited the hepatic lipid
accumulation (Figure 2B,C). These results suggest that the quinoxalinone structure might
play a potential role in lipid accumulation suppressing activity,
and some flavors might act as biofunctional materials. In future,
further studies are needed to examine the detailed molecular mechanism
underlying their actions, including CB2 agonistic activity and assess
their in vivo efficacy.

lipid accumulation
in HepG2 cells. The cells were incubated with each quinoxaline derivative
(10 μM) in the presence of 0.5 mM palmitate for 24 h in serum-free
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). The neutral

by Oil Red O staining. (A) Quinoxalinones 1a–o. (B) Tetrahydroquinoxalines 2a–o. (C) Quinoxalines 3a–k. Compounds 1k, 4a, and 4c could not be dissolved in media, so they were not included
in the data.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, a protocol for synthesizing a series of quinoxaline
derivatives, that is, the 3,4-dihydroquinoxalin-2(1H)-ones, quinoxalin-2(1H)-ones, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines,
and quinoxalines, varying in their four different oxidation states
but with the same carbon skeleton, has been developed from readily
available starting materials. These methods would serve the purposes
of the fine tuning of odorants as well as the biological activities
of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals and also the functions of materials
with the quinoxaline skeleton. Indeed, promising perfume and drug
candidates among the synthetic quinoxaline derivatives obtained in
this study have been observed in some cases. Studies for synthesizing
other quinoxaline derivatives from 2-haloanilines and amino acids
and a wide range of pharmaceutical and agrochemical activities for
the synthetic quinoxalines are now under investigation and will be
reported in due course.

Materials and Methods
Instruments
The 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were determined in CDCl3 solution using 400 and
100 MHz spectrometers, respectively. The proton chemical shifts (δ)
are relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS, δ = 0.0) as the internal
standard and expressed in parts per million. Spin multiplicities are
given as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), and m (multiplet)
as well as brs (broad singlet). Coupling constants (J) are listed in hertz. The infrared spectra were recorded by an Fourier
transform infrared spectrometer. Melting points were determined using
a Büchi melting point B-540 apparatus and are uncorrected.
The MS spectra were obtained using a mass spectrometer. The HRMS was
determined using a JEOL JNM-AX 500 mass spectrometer.

Chemicals
All chemical reagents were commercially available.
The solvents (chloroform (99%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (99%), ethyl
acetate (99%), hexane (99%), diethyl ether (99%), tetrahydrofuran
(THF) (99%), and toluene (99%)) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical
Industry Co., Ltd. and were directly used without further purification.
Unless otherwise stated, the reactions were monitored by thin layer
chromatography on silica gel plates (60 F254) and visualized with
ultraviolet light or iodine spray. Column chromatography was performed
on silica gel (60–120 mesh) using hexane and ethyl acetate.

General Procedure for the Preparation of 3,4-Dihydroquinoxalin-2(1H)-ones 1a–o
A suspension of
2-bromoaniline (1 equiv), amino acid (2–3 equiv), copper chloride
(I) (5–15 mol %), potassium phosphate (2–3 equiv), and
dimethylethylenediamine (20–60 mol %) in dry DMSO was degassed
with N2 for 5 min and stirred at 110 °C under a nitrogen
atmosphere for 24 h. The reaction mixture was quenched with water
and extracted with AcOEt. The organic layer was washed with water
and a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and then dried
over Na2SO4. After filtration, the solvent was
removed in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography
(eluent: hexanes/AcOEt) to afford the corresponding quinoxalin-2-one 1.

General Procedure for Synthesis
of 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroquinoxalines
Lithium aluminum hydride
(6.5–8.8 equiv) was dissolved in
dry THF under nitrogen at 0 °C. To the stirred solution, over
a period of 5 min, was added a solution of quinoxalin-2-one in dry
THF at 0 °C, and the mixture was refluxed for 18 h. The resulting
reaction mixture was quenched with water and AcOEt and filtered through
a Celite plug; then the solution was dried over Na2SO4. After filtration, the solvent was removed in vacuo. The
residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluent:
hexanes/AcOEt) to afford the corresponding 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline 2.

General Procedure for Synthesis of the Quinoxalines
A suspension of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline, V2O5 (2.5–3.0 equiv), and silica gel in toluene was stirred
at reflux temperature under Ar for 24 h. The reaction mixture was
cooled and filtered through a Celite plug using CHCl3.
The solvents were removed in vacuo, and the residue was purified by
silica gel column chromatography (eluent: hexanes/AcOEt) to afford
the corresponding quinoxaline 3.

Olfactory Evaluation
The olfactory properties of a
series of quinoxalinones 1, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines 2, and quinoxalines 3 were evaluated three times
every 1 or 2 days. The evaluation was carried out between 11:00 and
12:00 a.m. before lunch to obtain the most sensitive periods. The
five male panelists (35–50 years old) included a licensed smell
examiner, one of the national licensees in Japan, an analyst of volatile
components, and three flavorists. They had been trained in the objective
evaluation and expression of odors for both business and academic
research for over 15 years. They individually sniffed each compound
kept in a tube (0.8 cm × 5 cm). The amounts of the compounds
were about 20 mg each. Each panelist used as many odor-descriptive
terms as possible. Common terms used by more than 2 persons were selected
as the odorant attributes.

Biological Activity
Cell Culture
The
human hepatocyte cell line HepG2 (ATCC,
Manassas, VA) was cultured in DMEM with 5% FBS, 100 units/mL streptomycin,
and 100 μg/mL penicillin, at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Prior to the experiments, the cells were incubated
overnight with serum-free DMEM. After treatment, the cells were washed
twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with
radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 1% Triton X-100,
the phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, and the protease inhibitor cocktail.
The protein concentration of each lysate was determined using the
BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan).

Palmitate
Treatment and Oil Red O Staining
To induce
lipid overloading, HepG2 cells at the subconfluence were exposed to
palmitate-containing media. Culture media containing palmitate were
prepared, as previously described.5 Briefly,
sodium palmitate was dissolved in 50% v/v ethanol, diluted in serum-free
DMEM containing 1% w/v fatty acid free BSA, and incubated at 37 °C
for 2 h with shaking. The control medium containing ethanol and BSA
was similarly prepared. To evaluate the intracellular neutral lipid
accumulation, Oil Red O staining was performed according to the published
procedure with some modifications.5 Briefly,
the cells were fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, stained
with 1.8 mg/mL Oil Red O (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in a 60% aqueous
isopropanol solution for 15 min at room temperature, and rinsed twice
with 60% aqueous isopropanol and PBS. To quantify the cellular lipid
content, the Oil Red O was extracted with 100% isopropanol, and then
its absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a microplate reader. The
cellular neutral lipid content was normalized to the protein concentration.
