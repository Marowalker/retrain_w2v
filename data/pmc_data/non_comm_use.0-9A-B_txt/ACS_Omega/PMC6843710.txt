Quantum confinement effects in silicon
nanowires (SiNWs) are expected
when their diameter is less than the size of the free exciton (with
a Bohr radius ∼5 nm) in bulk silicon. However, their synthesis
represents a considerable technological challenge. The vapor–liquid–solid
(VLS) mechanism, mediated by metallic nanoclusters brought to the
eutectic liquid state, is most widely used for its simplicity and
control on the SiNWs size, shape, orientation, density, and surface
smoothness. VLS growth is often performed within high-vacuum physical
vapor deposition systems, where the eutectic composition and the pressure
conditions define the minimum diameter of the final nanowire usually
around 100 nm. In this article, we present and discuss the SiNWs’
growth by the VLS method in a plasma-based chemical vapor deposition
system, working in the mTorr pressure range. The purpose is to demonstrate
that it is possible to obtain nanostructures with sizes well beyond
the observed limit by modulating the deposition parameters, like chamber
pressure and plasma power, to find the proper thermodynamic conditions
for nucleation. The formation of SiNWs with sub-5 nm diameter is demonstrated.

Introduction
One-dimensional (1D) semiconductor nanostructures
exhibit extraordinary
electronic, optical, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties,
and for these reasons they have applications in very different areas
such as electronics, sensors, optoelectronics, and photovoltaics.1,2 Nanowires made of silicon (SiNWs) have attracted great interest
in the academic community because of its abundance, stability, and
nontoxicity. Important changes in the electronic structure of low-dimensional
Si take place, causing a transformation from indirect to direct band
gap and/or an increase of the band gap value. A well-known example
is the size dependence of the electronic band gap width of SiNWs:
as the wire diameter decreases, the band gap of the nanowire widens
and deviates from that of the bulk silicon.3 This happens as the diameter of the SiNWs reaches values smaller
than about 5 nm. It is known that when the diameter of the SiNW is
decreased to 3.5 nm, both the energies and the widths of the surface
and bulk plasmon peaks appear to increase.4 The behavior is more evident for the surface plasmon. The increase
in plasmon widths in small geometries has been attributed to increased
surface scattering, while the rest of the effects have been correlated
to spatial dispersion and generally to other nm-scale effects. In
another work, a high-energy resolution transmission electron microscopy
(TEM)–electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) study on SiNWs,
covered with SiO2 layers of the native oxide, is reported.
When the SiNW core diameter is small, the direct interband transitions
of Si core, due to monopolar surface plasmons, are observed, together
with the effect of thickness of the oxide shell layers on the direct
interband transition. In particular, when the wire diameter is below
10 nm, two peaks are observed due to the interband transitions of
Si, in the range 3–5 eV. They correspond to the imaginary part
of the dielectric function of Si, which in turn is related to the
single-electron excitations. A peak at about 8 eV is revealed and
is attributed to the plasmonic excitations at the Si/SiO2 interface due to the native oxide. The Si bulk plasmons peak is
observed in the range 16.6–16.9 eV.5 The electronic properties of SiNWs have been predicted by ab initio
techniques and depend on the orientation of the wires. Direct band
gaps, large band gap blue shift, and optical anisotropy between the
longitudinal and transverse direction have been found for [001]-oriented
wires. Unrelaxed [110] nanowires with size <4 nm have been found
exhibiting a direct gap; the [111] wires instead present an indirect
gap, unless the wire diameter is smaller than 2 nm, in which case,
it becomes direct.6 Sub-5 nm SiNWs, confined
in both [001] and [11̅0] directions, have been also embedded
in field effect transistors (FETs). The electrical characteristics
of the SiNW FET demonstrated step-like structures in the drain-source
current for low gate voltages and as a function of back-gate voltage
for various body lengths. This has been attributed to the confined
one-dimensional structure of the SiNW FETs. Each step-like feature
occurs at a threshold voltage corresponding to the confined carriers
occupying a one-dimensional subband.7

Such quantum properties make the SiNWs a very promising material
also for application in solar cells.1,2,8 Many top-down or bottom-up approaches have been developed
and applied for the synthesis of SiNWs. One of the most common top-down
methods is the metal-assisted chemical etching.9 It allows for obtaining very small SiNWs, with diameters
of the order of 5 nm; however, the nanostructures may present high
porosity and surface roughness.10,11 The surface roughness
affects, through the carriers recombination, the electrical yield
and the photoconversion properties in the device. For this reason,
deep knowledge and control of the nanowire roughening mechanism are
required for device application. Furthermore, it is not easy to implement
this synthesis technique within the production lines because it is
based on protocols not currently present in the industries. Another
of the most popular processes to synthesize SiNWs is based on a bottom-up
approach and it is the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) growth.12 It is known to produce nanostructures with high
surface quality.13 The VLS process is usually
mediated by the presence of a metallic particle, such as gold, which
works as a catalyst. During the growth, several processes take place:
(i) the Au nanoparticles are deposited over the Si substrate and brought
to the eutectic temperature of the Au/Si system forming alloy liquid
droplets, (ii) the precursor gas selectively decomposes on the liquid
cluster, (iii) supersaturates inside the eutectic mixture, (iv) due
to the concentration gradient, the Si atoms diffuse toward the interface
with the c-Si substrate, (v) where they nucleate the solid crystalline
Si phase leading to the formation of a 1D nanostructure. Despite the
several processes needed to take place for the formation of SiNWs,
the VLS mechanism is fast and can be well controlled through the deposition
parameters. VLS can be obtained during laser ablation,14 in physical vapor deposition systems like the
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)15,16 and in the chemical
vapor deposition (CVD). MBE systems present the drawback of requiring
high-vacuum chamber conditions. Moreover, the SiNWs diameter typically
ranges in the tens to hundreds nanometer size interval.16 This experimental evidence has been attributed
to the presence of a thermodynamic limit producing a minimum size
of the stable liquid particle.2 CVD systems
provide high control on the deposition parameters and on the morphological
characteristics of the deposited material and are already present
in the production industries.17−19 Preliminary works have shown
that it is possible to tune the partial pressure of the Si precursor
gas to obtain SiNWs with diameters smaller than 100 nm.20 The results were explained in terms of the chemical
potential of Si in the nanowires, higher than that of Si in the vapor
phase due to high surface-to-volume ratio of the nanostructure. When
the pressure is low, the chemical potential balance prevents SiNW
nucleation inside small eutectic droplets. When the pressure increases,
the vapor chemical potential increases as well and the growth of small
NWs becomes possible. The smallest observed SiNW, presented in that
case,20 a diameter of about 15 nm. However,
another part of the literature claims that the radius depends on the
eutectic composition, governed also by the partial pressure of the
gas.21,22 Therefore, the critical radius is defined
not by the thermodynamic conditions but by the kinetic ones, with
the lower limit for the size so far unknown. This is because the only
limiting step for growth is identified in the dissociative silane
absorption on the droplet, which is an irreversible process, i.e.,
once dissolved it does not re-evaporate. Thus, the chemical potential
of silicon in NWs is irrelevant for growth. The same literature predicts
that SiNWs smaller than those observed till now, i.e., 5 nm, can be
synthesized but it does not prove it experimentally. SiNWs thinner
than 5 nm were experimentally observed in one case through a double
growth step: the first step, VLS-mediated, was necessary to grow SiNWs
on the Si substrate; during the second phase, nano-Si branches were
grown on the surface of the previously grown SiNWs.23 In the design of the experiment, the double step was chosen
to exploit the small dimension of gold catalyst dots, which in those
experimental conditions diffuse over the surface of the main NWs during
the growth. It is presumable that in this case, the kinetic conditions
have led to the formation of these small nanostructures only on the
main trunks but not on the substrate surface. Some other approaches
propose the possibility of oxidizing SiNWs grown by VLS-mediated CVD.24 However, this approach has several disadvantages
such as the formation of local defects that change the crystalline
structure of the SiNWs. No results are present so far for the formation
of SiNWs smaller than 5 nm, by VLS in CVD systems, although their
synthesis has been theoretically anticipated. The focus of the present
work is to synthesize SiNWs by means of VLS-CVD and to explore the
conditions favorable to obtain quantum SiNWs. By fixing the temperature,
we study the role of the CVD chamber pressure and of the plasma power
and show that it is possible to appropriately modulate the conditions
ruling the nanostructure nucleation and obtain SiNWs with diameters
of 5 nm and smaller.

Methods
Synthesis
of SiNWs
The substrates used for the SiNWs deposition were
p-type 6″ 1–5 Ω cm Si wafers. After a brief hydrofluoric
acid (HF) dip, Au dots with a density of 2 × 1012 cm–2 and average radius of 1.6 nm were deposited by sputtering
into a K675XD magnetron sputter, and after a second HF dip, they were
loaded in the CVD chamber. The second HF dip was performed to remove
the thin oxide shell present on the surface of the gold nanodots and
to promote catalysis. More details are reported in refs (18, 19). The inductively coupled plasma-CVD, i.e.,
ICP-CVD, reactor has a vertical geometry (different from a parallel
plate capacitive plasma-enhanced CVD) in which the ignition gas (Ar)
is injected along the vertical axis of the reactor chamber and SiH4 (99.99% pure SiH4) is injected through a ring
a few centimeters above the sample. Energetic electrons diffusing
out from the Ar plasma region hit the SiH4 molecules and
give rise to their decomposition. Table 1 reports the CVD deposition parameters used
in the present experiments. The substrates used in this work were
heated at 395 °C for 1 h before the deposition, which were performed
with a gas ratio of SiH4/Ar = 30, for a total deposition
time of 30 min and changing both the plasma power (20–40 W)
and the gas pressure (20, 35, and 50 mTorr) as reported in Table 1.

Previous experiments were performed to explore larger
ranges of
these parameters but the SiNW growth was not observed.

Morphological
and Structural Characterization
After the deposition, the
samples
were analyzed using a ZEISS SUPRA35 scanning electron microscope (SEM)
with a field emission electron gun. Appropriate image processing was
used to convert the images from gray scale to black and white type
to define the threshold that identifies the edges of the structural
characterization was performed using transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) in standard and scanning modes. Energy-filtered TEM
(EFTEM) analysis was obtained with a JEOL JEM 2010F machine operating
at 200 kV equipped with a Schottky field emission gun and a post-column
Gatan Imaging Filter. The energy-filtered images at 16 eV were acquired
by selecting the energy window characteristic of bulk Si plasmon loss
in the electron energy loss spectrum (EELS).

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
SEM images acquired in a planar view of the SiNW samples deposited
at the plasma power of 20 W, setting the chamber pressure at (a) 20
mTorr, (b) 35 mTorr, and (c) 50 mTorr. As observed, the density of
the grown SiNWs is larger at 50 mTorr. In fact, at 20 mTorr, the density
of the SiNWs is equal to 4.9 × 109 cm–2, at 35 mTorr, it is 6.48 × 109 cm–2, and at 50 mTorr, it is 1 × 1010 cm–2.

Figure 1 SEM images acquired in a planar view of the SiNW samples deposited
at the plasma power of 20 W and setting the chamber pressure at (a)
20 mTorr, (b) 35 mTorr, and (c) 50 mTorr.

The qualitative observation of the SEM analysis, shown in Figure 1, preliminary suggests
that at 50 mTorr the size of the NWs decreases with respect to the
low-pressure conditions. This aspect is better quantified from the
calculation of the SiNW size distribution, reported in Figure 2 as a function of their diameter
for several chamber partial pressures of 20 mTorr (green symbols),
35 mTorr (red), and 50 mTorr (black). The graphs in the figure confirm
that the NWs grown at 50 mTorr present a density distribution peaked
at diameters smaller than those grown at 20 and 35 mTorr. At 5 nm,
the SiNW distribution provides density values of about 3 × 107 (20 mTorr), 4 × 107 (35 mTorr), and 2 ×
108 cm–2 nm–1 (50 mTorr),
respectively.

Figure 2 SiNWs size distribution determined by SEM images analysis
for the
samples deposited at 20 W of plasma power and 20 mTorr (green), 35
mTorr (red), and 50 mTorr (black) of chamber partial pressure.

Figure 3 reports
the SEM images of the SiNWs grown at a constant pressure of 50 mTorr
when the plasma power varies between 20 and 40 W. From the figure,
we can see that the SiNWs grown at a power of 20 and 30 W are almost
similar in density and size, while at 40 W, they drastically decrease
in density and increase in dimension. Moreover, the presence of roughness
on the substrate surface testifies the evident formation of Si by
noncatalyzed growth.

Figure 3 SEM images acquired in a planar view of the SiNW samples
deposited
at the Ar/SiH4 gas pressure of 50 mTorr by varying the
plasma power: (a) 20 W, (b) 30 W, and (c) 40 W.

The density results can be quantitatively understood by comparing
the size distribution for the different cases. Figure 4 displays the SiNWs size density distributions
calculated by the SEM images analysis shown in Figure 3, i.e., for the samples deposited at 50 mTorr
and 20 W (black), 30 W (red), and 40 W (green). The size distributions
at 20 and 30 W are quite similar and peak at about 10 nm, showing
that the plasma power in this range does not play a role in the SiNW
diameters and confirming what is observed before, i.e., the pressure
plays a major role in this process. At 40 W, however, the curve demonstrates
a size distribution centered at ∼60 nm. The density of SiNWs
obtained at plasma powers of 20, 30, and 40 W is, respectively, of
the order 1 × 1010, 1.1 × 1010, and
4.8 × 108 cm–2. The low density
of SiNWs grown at a power of 40 W is attributed to the noncatalyzed
growth process, which under these conditions, becomes competitive
compared to the catalyzed one. Large size is attributed to the fact
that the small gold nanoparticles become buried during the competitive
and fast SiH4 dissociation uncatalyzed process.18

Figure 4 SiNWs size distribution calculated by SEM images analysis
for the
samples deposited at 50 mTorr and 20 W (black), 30 W (red), and 40
W (green).

To further investigate the presence
of SiNWs with quantum size,
the samples have been observed by TEM analysis since the SEM resolution
is not sufficient to resolve objects below 5 nm. Figure 5 illustrates the TEM analysis
obtained on the SiNWs at 20 W and 20 mTorr. The images in (a), (b),
and (c) are taken in high-resolution mode and report SiNWs with diameters,
respectively, of 2.8, 3.5, and 4 nm. The image in (d) represents an
energy-filtered TEM acquired at 16 eV, i.e., close to the bulk Si
plasmon excitation loss, with an energy window of 4 eV. The SiNW diameters
measured correspond, respectively, to 2.8, 3.5, 4 and 3.5 nm. This
demonstrates the presence of SiNWs with sizes smaller than 5 nm.

Figure 5 TEM acquired
on the SiNWs grown at 20 W and 20 mTorr, imaged in
high-resolution TEM mode (a–c) and in energy-filtered TEM mode
by selecting the 16 eV plasmon peak (d). The SiNW diameters measured
correspond, respectively, to 2.8, 3.5, 4, and 3.5 nm.

This result has to be attributed to the high partial pressure
experienced
by the metallic catalytic particle, liquid in the eutectic phase reached
during the deposition, favoring the survival of the critical nucleus
of Si precipitated after supersaturation. During the CVD deposition,
the Si wafer with the Au dots on the surface is brought to 390 °C,
a temperature higher than the Au–Si eutectic temperature. The
Au nanodots in contact with the Si substrate form small liquid droplets
of Au/Si eutectic alloy. The Gibbs–Thomson equation in this
case is20 1  where
Δμw = μw – μv, Δμb = μb –
μv, and μw, μv,
μb are the effective chemical potentials of Si in
the NWs, in the vapor, and in the bulk state, respectively, Ω
is the atomic volume of Si, and α and rd are the NW surface free energy and the droplet radius, respectively.
For very small eutectic droplets, the inequality μw > μv is verified due to the large surface-to-volume
ratio of the NWs. During surface diffusion, the droplet size can increase
and reach a critical diameter, ruled by the allowed composition constrain
in the droplet21 to allow the SiNW growth. Equation 1 hence sets a lower
limit on the SiNWs that can grow under specific growth conditions.
The experimental evidence for the minimum SiNW width has been also
demonstrated by experimental data.20 The
explanation provided is that if the chamber pressure is increased,
μw increases leading to a more negative Δμb and allowing for the growth of small SiNWs.

Moreover, Tan demonstrated
that while the minimum droplet radius rd is univocally determined (through the thermodynamic relation eq 1) by the vapor pressure
conditions, there is not a thermodynamic constrain for the radius rNW cylindrical SiNW. As a consequence, the interplay
between initial droplet geometry and the kinetic conditions implemented
during the growth could also allow for the growth of smaller NWs,
consistent with the fact that our size distributions tend to a finite
value close to the 0 size for some process parameter settings (see Figure 4, red and black lines).
The results presented demonstrate that SiNWs with sizes ranging between
2.5 and 80 nm can be synthesized. For applications where a uniform
size is needed, other approaches can be envisaged, such as by controlling
and fixing the catalyst size or by using lithographic mask constraints.27

Conclusions
In this work, a study
on the formation of SiNWs with diameters
as small as 5 nm, grown by VLS in the plasma-based CVD system, is
reported. It is shown that the nanostructures can be obtained at pressures
in the range between 20 and 50 mTorr. The peak of the size distribution
appears at smaller sizes as the pressure increases. If the plasma
power changes between 20 and 30 W, it plays a limited role in the
size of SiNWs. The density value of SiNWs reached is as high as 1.1
× 1010 cm–2. To our knowledge, this
is the first study where SiNWs as thin as 2.8 nm are obtained through
direct deposition by VLS-CVD.
