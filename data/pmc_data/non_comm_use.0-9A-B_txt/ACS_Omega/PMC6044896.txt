Cationic
lipid-guided nucleic acid delivery holds great promise
in gene therapy and genome-editing applications for treating genetic
diseases. However, the major challenge lies in achieving therapeutically
relevant efficiencies. Prior findings, including our own, demonstrated
that asymmetry in the hydrophobic core of cationic lipids imparted
superior transfection efficiencies. To this end, we have developed
a lipid nanocarrier system with an asymmetric hydrophobic core (PS-Lips) derived from a mixture of fatty acids of food-grade
palmstearin and compared its efficiency with symmetric palmitic acid-based
nanocarrier system (P-Lip). PS-Lips exhibited
superior transfection efficiencies with both plasmid DNA (pDNA) and
mRNA in multiple cultured cells than the control P-Lip. More importantly, PS-Lips exhibited 2-fold superior
transfections with linear nucleic acid, green fluorescent protein
(GFP) mRNA in hematopoietic cells, when compared with the commercial
control lipofectamine RNAiMAX. PS-Lips was also found
to be effective in delivering genome-editing tools (CRISPR/Cas9, sgRNA
encoded pDNA with a reporter GFP construct) than P-Lip in HEK-293 cells. In the present study, we report that cationic
liposomes derivatized from natural food-grade fat palmstearin with
a natural hydrophobic core asymmetry are efficient in delivering both
linear and circular nucleic acids. In particular, PS-Lips is efficient in delivering mRNA to hematopoietic cells. These findings
can be further exploited in the genome-editing approach for treating
β-globinopathies.

Introduction
Biological findings
in the recent past, including CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
genome-editing, have widened the application window of nucleic acid
delivery for investigating and manipulating cellular processes.1 Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated
that the modification of human cells at the genetic level significantly
improves their therapeutic potentials.2−4 Vectors play a critical
role in the efficient delivery of nucleic acids.5 To date, viral vectors have been well-explored as they
are efficient in delivering nucleic acids both in vitro and in vivo.
However, the random integration of the virus vector into the host
genome, which may interrupt the essential gene expression and cellular
processes, limits their therapeutic applications.6 More importantly, the scalability of the vectors is labor
intensive and technically demanding; hence, making them into a clinically
viable product is a significant challenge.7 Hence, alternate efforts have been directed toward developing nonviral
transfection methods.8,9 Effective and safe nucleic acid
delivery requires an engineering of synthetic vectors, which are highly
biocompatible, nontoxic, and efficient in nature.10,11 Such synthetic lipids are much better than the viral vectors in
terms of safety.12 Among the nonviral vectors,
cationic lipids hold great promise, owing to their biocompatibility
and ease in robust scalability.13 However,
lower efficiencies and higher cytotoxicities limit their therapeutic
applications.14 To this end, numerous structure–activity
investigations have been performed on the molecular architecture for
enhancing their efficacy.14−16 Typically, cationic lipids consist
of a hydrophilic head group and a hydrophobic domain containing either
hydrocarbon chains or steroidal moieties connected with/without a
spacer/linker group. The molecular framework of the lipid plays an
important role in influencing the transfection properties of the liposomal
system. Prior findings, including our own, demonstrated the significance
of variation/asymmetry of chain lengths within the hydrophobic region.17−19 Taking cues from these findings, we further demonstrated that the
hydrophobic chain asymmetry that originated from food-grade coconut
oil enhanced the transfection properties of the liposomal system by
greater than 4-fold and was found to be safer, when compared with
its symmetric lauric acid (C12) analogue.20 However, greater variation in the chain lengths of the fatty acyl
chains from coconut oil, which ranges from C6 to C18:2, makes it difficult
to maintain the uniform composition from batch to batch.

To
minimize such a variation, we chose edible fat, palmstearin,
which contains minimal variation in fatty acyl chains ranging from
myristic acid (C14) to linoleic acid (C18:2) as compared to coconut
oil. In the present study, we have developed a cationic lipid nanocarrier
system (PS-Lips) with fatty acyl chains from palmstearin
and evaluated their nucleic acid delivery efficiencies in vitro using
different nucleic acids (Figure 1). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), a
well-known biophysical technique, was employed to investigate the
possible mechanism involved in enhanced transfection efficiencies
of the cationic lipid nanocarrier system, PS-Lips. Further,
we expand the horizon of the PS-Lips nanocarrier system’s
application as a toolset for delivering genome-editing tools.

Results and Discussion
Recent advances in nucleic acid delivery and genomic science, including
genome-editing with CRISPR/Cas9, have emphasized the significance
of developing safer and efficient nonviral nucleic acid delivery reagents.21,22 Among various vectors, cationic lipids are found to be promising
in delivering different types of nucleic acids such as plasmid DNA
(pDNA), shRNA, siRNA, and microRNA.23,24 Despite the
advantages, their application is limited because of lower transfection
efficiencies and higher cytotoxicities.25 In our continuous efforts to develop efficient transfection reagents
to overcome the limitations, previously, we demonstrated an intriguing
strategy of developing cationic lipids from food-grade coconut oil.20 Our prior findings convincingly demonstrated
that cationic lipids prepared using a mixture of fatty acids derived
from coconut oil impart membrane fusion and enhance gene-delivery
efficacies.20 However, the major limitation
with cationic lipids derivatized from coconut oil is the reproducibility
of the same composition because of a large variation in the fatty
acyl chain lengths, which ranges from C6:0 to C18:2 (batch to batch
variation). To overcome the limitation, we have developed a cationic
lipid pool from palmstearin, which has less variation as compared
to coconut oil. Because food-grade palmstearin (triacylglycerols)
contains myristoyl (C14) to linoleoyl (C18:2) chain lengths, we envisaged
that saponification of palmstearin yields a pool of fatty acyl chains,
which can be used as the hydrophobic core for the development of a
cationic lipid nanocarrier system containing natural fatty acyl chain
asymmetry of palmstearin (Figure 1). We anticipated that such a cationic lipid nanocarrier
system would be nontoxic and more efficient in transfection as it
is derived from a food-grade source, and such a nanocarrier system
mimics the plasma membrane fatty acyl chain composition.

Synthesis
PS-Lips, a cationic lipid nanocarrier
system with the hydrophobic core derived from commercially available
food-grade palmstearin (fatty acid mixture obtained by the saponification
method), was synthesized in three steps, as shown in Scheme 1A. Briefly, palmstearin was
saponified using aq KOH, followed by acidification with dil HCl to
obtain a fatty acid mixture. Next, the fatty acid mixture extracted
from palmstearin was converted to corresponding fatty acyl chlorides
using oxalyl chloride and reacted with N-methyl-diethanolamine
to give tertiary amine compound, b (Scheme 1A). Finally, intermediate b was reacted with 2-iodo ethanol to yield quaternary iodide
salt of PS-Lips, followed by chloride ion exchange using
Amberlite IRA 400 Cl– to yield the target compound, PS-Lips (Scheme 1A). As a control lipid, we have synthesized P-Lip (Scheme 1B), which contains
only palmitic chains in the hydrophobic core, following the same synthetic
protocol used for the preparation of PS-Lips.

(PS-Lips) and (B) Control Palmitic-Based Cationic Lipid
Nanocarrier System (P-Lip)
Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) Quantification
A portion
from the mixture of fatty acids extracted from palmstearin following
saponification was converted to corresponding fatty acyl methyl esters
for FAME quantification using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS). Next, the fatty acids from the cationic lipid nanocarrier
system, PS-Lips, were extracted by usual saponification,
converted to their fatty acyl methyl esters, and subjected to FAME
quantification. The compositions of both palmstearin and PS-Lips derived fatty acids were analyzed (Figure 2). The results showed that palmstearin contains
63% of C16 and 25% of C18:1, whereas PS-Lips had 53%
of C16 and 35% of C18:1. Other fatty acids such as C12, C14, C18,
and C18:2 were less than 6% (Figure 2). First, we confirmed that the fatty acid compositions
of palmstearin did not get grossly affected upon developing into a
cationic lipid nanocarrier system, PS-Lips (Figure 1 and Scheme 1A). The percentage of fatty
acid methyl esters obtained from the cationic lipid nanocarrier system, PS-Lips, matched <90% with the original fatty acid esters
of palmstearin in GC analysis (Figure 2). In both, the palmitate group (C16 ∼55%) and
the oleate group (C18:1 ∼35%) were found to be present as the
major aliphatic chains with a contribution of >85% (Figure 2).

acid isolation from palmstearin and PS-Lips (above) and

starting material, palmstearin, and the cationic lipid nanocarrier
system, PS-Lips, using GC analysis of fatty acid methyl
esters from palmstearin and PS-Lips (below).

Size and Zeta Potential Measurements
Next, we characterized
the physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface potentials,
and DNA-binding properties of the liposomes PS-Lips and
control P-Lip. The size of liposomes obtained by the
dynamic light scattering (DLS) study of PS-Lips and P-Lip was found to be 175.3 and 206.6 nm, respectively, whereas
the potentials were in the range of 2.6–2.8 meV for both liposomes
(Table S1, Supporting Information). Lipoplexes
of both PS-Lips and P-Lip showed sizes between
250 and 670 nm across the lipid/DNA charge ratio of 0.5:1 to 8:1 (Table
S2, Supporting Information). Similar to
the size data, the zeta potentials did not show any significant variation
for lipoplexes of PS-Lips and P-Lip. The
potentials of PS-Lips lipoplexes were found to be slightly
higher (+27.7 to +16.2 meV) across the 8:1 to 2:1 lipid/DNA charge
ratio, whereas it was +23.6 to +10.4 meV for P-Lip at
the same charge ratios (Table S2, Supporting Information). However, the zeta potentials for lipoplexes of PS-Lips and P-Lip at lower lipid/DNA charge ratios, that is,
1:1 and 0.5:1, exhibited comparable potentials of +2.2 and −6.3
meV (for PS-Lips) and +1.8 and −3.3 meV, respectively
(Table S2, Supporting Information). The
comparable potentials for PS-Lips and P-Lip could be due to the structural similarity of their cationic lipids,
equivalent charges, and hydrodynamic diameters of their lipoplexes.

DNA-Binding Study
DNA-binding studies with liposomes
of PS-Lips and P-Lip in complexation with
the pDNA (pCMV-SPORT-β-gal expressing β-galactosidase
enzyme) were performed using the conventional agarose gel retardation
assay (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Both PS-Lips and P-Lips showed high
DNA binding across the lipid/DNA charge ratio of 8:1–2:1, whereas
moderate DNA binding was observed at 1:1 and 0.5:1 lipid/DNA charge
ratios (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Physicochemical studies including DLS and gel retardation studies
revealed that the nanocarriers had better DNA-binding efficiency from
2:1 lipid/DNA charge ratios.

In Vitro Transfection Biology
In
vitro gene-delivery
efficacies of PS-Lips and P-Lip were evaluated
in multiple cultured mammalian cells including CHO (Chinese hamster
ovary cells), COS-1 (SV40 transformed African green monkey kidney
cells), B16F10 (murine melanoma cells), and HepG2 (human hepato carcinoma
cells) using pCMV-SPORT-β-gal plasmid DNA as the reporter gene
encoding the enzyme β-galactosidase, as described previously.26 Liposomes of PS-Lips exhibited
∼2–5 folds of high transfection as compared to P-Lip in the above listed cell lines at the lipid/DNA charge
ratio of 2:1 (Figure 3A). Liposomes of PS-Lips showed comparable gene-transfer
efficiencies with Lipofectamine 2000 in CHO and COS-1 cells (Figure 3A).

ratio (A). Microscopy images for cellular eGFP expression in human
embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells (B). Lipoplexes of PS-Lips and P-Lip with pDNA encoding GFP were transfected in
HEK-293 cells at a 2:1 lipid/DNA charge ratio, and images were obtained
using an inverted fluorescence microscope. Lipofectamine 2000 was
used as the positive control for transfections.

Next, we evaluated the cellular uptake and expression with PS-Lips and P-Lip using eGFP pDNA (plasmid DNA
encoding green fluorescence protein) in representative HEK-293 (human
embryonic kidney cells) at a 2:1 lipid/DNA charge ratio. Fluorescence
microscope images revealed that cells receiving lipoplexes of PS-Lips and pDNA (eGFP) showed higher fluorescence as compared
to lipoplexes of P-Lip and pDNA (Figure 3B). Further, the cellular eGFP expression
in HEK 293 cells with PS-Lips was found to be on par
with Lipofectamine 2000 (Figure 3B). In line with in vitro findings from multiple cultured
cells including CHO, COS-1, B16F10, and HepG2, liposomes prepared
from PS-Lips exhibited an efficient cellular expression
in HEK 293 than their symmetric dipalmitoyl counterpart, P-Lip. Data obtained from transfection studies and the cellular expression
suggest that PS-Lips shows an enhanced gene-delivery
activity and its efficiency is comparable with commercial Lipofectamine
2000 (Figure 3).

mRNA Transfections
After the successful demonstration
of pDNA transfections using the PS-Lips nanocarrier system,
we wanted to explore whether this nanocarrier system could deliver
linear nucleic acids such as mRNA. In this regard, we evaluated the
transfection efficiencies of both cationic nanocarriers (PS-Lips and P-Lip) in the adherent cell line, HEK-293, and
in suspension cells, K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line)
and HEL-1 (human erythroleukemia cell line), using GFP encoding mRNA
(Figure 4A–D).
Surprisingly, liposomes of PS-Lips exhibited ∼2-fold
high transfection as compared to P-Lip in HEK-293 at
the lipid/mRNA charge ratio of 8:1 (Figure 4A,B) and exhibited comparable transfections
with the commercial control RNAiMAX. Interestingly, mRNA transfections
with the PS-lips nanocarrier system exhibited 2-fold
superior transfection in both K562 and HEL-1 cells than the P-Lip nanocarrier system and commercial control RNAiMAX (Figure 4C,D). PS-Lips nanocarriers exhibited higher transfection efficiencies both with
circular pDNA and linear mRNA at different lipid/base charge ratios.
For circular DNA, maximum transfection efficiencies were observed
at a 2:1 charge ratio, whereas for linear mRNA, it was 8:1. The higher
charge ratios for mRNA compared to pDNA is possibly because of the
difference in the net ion charge on the nucleic acids. Circular nucleic
acids are compacted with a large amount of their counterions, yielding
a lower effective negative charge compared to the neutral ones.27 Hence, linear nucleic acids require a higher
charge ratio compared to circular nucleic acids.

HEK 293 (B), and suspension cell lines, HEL-1 (C) and K-562 (D). Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX was used as the positive control for mRNA transfections.

CRISPR/Cas9 pDNA Transfection
Recent findings demonstrated
that lipid-mediated toolsets for delivering CRISPR/Cas9-encoded pDNA
were found to be effective.28−30 Transfection results obtained
from pDNA and mRNA nucleic acid delivery using PS-Lips and P-Lip compelled us to evaluate their efficacies
in delivering CRISPR tools. To explore the ability of PS-Lips in delivering the genome-editing system, we evaluated the efficiency
with the pL-CRISPR.EFS.GFP plasmid construct (11.7 kb), which expresses
both Cas9 and eGFP proteins driven through the EFS promoter as a single
transcript.31 The amount of Cas9 protein
expression is directly correlated with the eGFP expression as a single
transcript producing both Cas9 and eGFP proteins aided by the self-cleaving
P2A peptides, which works through ribosomal skipping of peptide bond
formation at the terminal proline residue in the P2A peptide resulting
in the production of individual polypeptides. PS-Lips delivered the CRSIPR plasmid 1.5-fold more effectively than P-Lip (Figure 5). However, the efficacy of PS-Lips was found to be
less when compared with the commercial control Lipofectamine 3000
(Figure 5). Because
the plasmid size is large (11.7 kb), the condensation of pDNA would
have been not adequate enough to effectively transfect into the cell,
resulting in a lesser transfection efficiency for PS-Lips over Lipofectamine 3000. Further studies directed toward the combined
use of PS-Lips with DNA-condensing agents for delivering
larger size plasmids such as CRISPR plasmids are warranted. However,
to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report
on developing a cationic toolset designed with the asymmetric hydrophobic
chain lengths of food-grade vegetable fat, palmstearin, for delivering
CRISPR tools.

Figure 5 Delivery of all-in-one CRISPR plasmid. Lipoplexes of PS-Lips and P-Lip with pL-CRISPR.EFS.GFP were
transfected in
HEK-293 cells at a 2:1 lipid to DNA charge ratio; images were obtained
using an inverted fluorescence microscope, and quantification data
were obtained by flow cytometric analysis.

In vitro transfection studies including pDNA, mRNA, and CRISPR
constructs suggested that PS-Lips nanocarriers have better
transfection efficiencies compared to the symmetric P-Lip. PS-Lips nanocarriers exhibited unique characteristics
that could deliver a wide range of nucleic acids from 1 to 11 kb and
linear, circular constructs. Next, we evaluated the cytotoxicities
of the nanocarrier systems to confirm whether it had any role in the
differential transfection profiles of P-Lip over PS-Lips.

Cell Viability
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT)-based cell viability assay32 was performed in representative CHO cells using the lipoplexes
(lipid/DNA complexes) of PS-Lips and P-Lip for 24 h. Cell viability data revealed a remarkably noncytotoxic
nature (>90% cell viability, Figure S11, Supporting Information) for both the lipids across the lipid/DNA charge
ratios 8:1–0.5:1, which are used in our transfection experiments
(Figures 3 and 4) except for P-Lip at a 8:1 lipid/DNA
charge ratio (which showed ∼70% cell viability). Thus, these
cell viability results summarized in Figure S11, Supporting Information rule out the possibility of any inherent
cellular cytotoxicities playing a role behind the relatively compromised/poor
transfection efficiencies of P-Lip and PS-Lips. These results also indicate that PS-Lips is safer
to use even above the 4:1 lipid/DNA charge ratio.

To understand
the superior transfection properties of PS-Lips over P-Lip, first, we evaluated the cellular uptake of the rhodamine-PE
labelled lipoplexes and also measured the membrane fusion using FRET.

Cellular Uptake Study
Liposomes of rhodamine-PE labeled PS-Lips and P-Lip in complexation with pDNA (pCMV-SPORT-β-gal)
were used to check the cellular uptake of the lipids in representative
CHO cells at a 2:1 lipid/DNA charge ratio. The in vitro uptake studies
revealed that the lipoplexes of PS-Lips were found to
be high when compared to its control dipalmitoyl analogue, P-Lip (Figure 6A,B).

(C). Liposome–biomembrane fusion was induced by the addition
of PS-Lips and P-Lip liposomes with the
dual fluorophore (Rho-PE and NBD-PE)-labeled membrane mimicking DOPC/DOPE/DOPS/Chol
liposomal formulation. The values shown are representative of three
independent measurements.

The superior cellular uptake of lipoplexes of PS-Lips than P-Lip is corroborated with the transfection studies
and also supports the fact that possible high transfection efficacies
could be originating from the high membrane fusogenic nature of the
cationic lipid nanocarrier system from palmstearin in PS-Lips. To ascertain the fusogenic nature of PS-Lips over P-Lip, we performed FRET studies.

Biomembrane Fusogenicities
To gain mechanistic insight
into the enhanced transfection efficiencies of PS-Lips lipid nanocarrier system over the control dipalmitoyl analogue P-Lip, we assessed their relative biomembrane fusogenicities
with a dual fluorophore NBD-PE (as a donor) and Rho-PE (as an acceptor)-labelled
membrane model, DOPC/DOPE/DOPS/Chol (dioleyol-phosphatidyl choline/dioleyol-phosphatidyl
ethanolamine/dioleyol phosphatidylserine/cholesterol at 45:20:20:15,
w/w) using the FRET assay.33 The normalized
fluorescence recovery at 590 nm for the liposomes of PS-Lips and the control lipid P-Lip was 55 and 45%, respectively
(Figure 6C), suggesting
higher membrane fusogenicity of the asymmetric cationic lipid nanocarrier
system, PS-Lips, than their symmetric lipid analogue, P-Lip. These findings support the notion that enhanced transfection
efficiencies of the cationic lipid nanocarrier system might have originated
because of their higher plasma membrane fusogenicity (Figure 6C). Efficiency of cationic
lipid-mediated transfection critically depends on the lipoplexes entry
into the cells (endocytosis), release of pDNA from the endosomes to
escape lysosomal degradation, and entry into the nucleus for gene
expression. Hydrophobic chain asymmetry imparts higher membrane fusogenicity
with both plasma and endosomal membranes. Thus, it is a critical parameter
for delivering nucleic acids into the cytoplasm.

Endocytosis
Blockers Study
Towards probing the cellular
entry of lipoplexes, we pretreated cells with sucrose, a clathrin-mediated
endocytosis inhibitor reduced the methyl-β-cyclodextrin
(M-β-CD), a cholesterol depleting agent,34 nystatin, an inhibitor of caveolae-mediated endocytosis,35 and dynasore, a small molecule dynamin II inhibitor36 before transfections. Both clathrin and caveolae
inhibitors had less effect on transfections with PS-Lips compared to P-Lip. These findings suggested that membrane
fusion was driving PS-Lips from endocytosis to direct
delivery of pDNA into cytoplasm (Figure 7). Membrane fusion of the lipids is an efficient
transport of biomolecules than the endocytosis process.37,38 Liposomal systems were developed to mimic membrane fusion events.39 In line with the prior findings, our results
confirmed that the superior transfection activity of PS-Lips over P-Lips is due to the intracellular delivery of
lipoplex through membrane fusion and is less endocytosis dependent.

2:1 lipid/DNA charge ratio of PS-Lips and P-Lip lipoplexes.

Conclusions
In
this study, we demonstrated that the cationic lipid nanocarrier
system, PS-Lips, prepared using the fatty acid mixture
derivatized from food-grade palmstearin exhibited enhanced transfection
efficiencies in both adherent and suspension cells than its control
dipalmitoyl lipid analogue, P-Lip, which contributes
more than 50% of the hydrophobic core of the PS-Lips lipid
nanocarrier system. Mechanistic insight into the improved activity
of the PS-Lips lipid nanocarrier system than the control
symmetric analogue, P-Lip, using FRET and cellular uptake
studies revealed that the higher transfection property possibly results
from the fusogenic nature of the cationic lipid nanocarrier system
(PS-Lips) liposomes. We further demonstrated that the
liposomes from the cationic lipid nanocarrier system (PS-Lips) effectively delivered genome-editing tools containing CRISPR/Cas9
encoded pDNA and has an enhanced genome-editing efficiency than their
control dipalmitoyl counterpart (P-Lip). In summary,
our findings collectively demonstrate that the cationic lipid nanocarrier
system (PS-Lips) prepared using the fatty acid mixture
from food-grade oils such as palmstearin could be more effective,
economic, and safer for nucleic acid delivery and genome-editing applications.

Materials
and Methods
General Procedures and Reagents
Proton nuclear magnetic
resonance (1H NMR) spectra and electrospray ionization
(ESI)-mass spectral data were recorded on an AV 300 MHz NMR spectrometer
and an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, SanJose, CA,
USA) equipped with an ESI source or a Micromass Quattro LC triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer, respectively. Column chromatography
was performed with 60–120 mesh silica gel (Acme Synthetic Chemicals,
India). All reagents used for synthesis were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, USA unless otherwise stated. NP-40, antibiotics, and agarose
were procured from HiMedia, India. Cell lines (CHO, COS-1, and HEK-293)
were procured from the National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune, India.
Suspension cells (Hel-1 and K-562) were obtained from ATCC. Cells
were cultured in an incubator in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2/95% air. GlutaMAX
and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagents were obtained from
Thermo Scientific. CleanCap eGFP mRNA was purchased from TriLink BioTechnologies.

Syntheses
The cationic lipids, PS-Lips and P-Lip, were synthesized, as shown in Scheme 1A,B. Optimized synthesis protocols
and purification conditions for lipids are described below. Structures
of PS-Lips and P-Lip and their synthetic
intermediates were confirmed by 1H NMR and ESI-MS. Analysis
of the chemical characterizations of the lipids, PS-Lips and P-Lip, as well as those of their synthetic intermediates
shown in Scheme 1A,B
are described. The purity of both cationic lipids, PS-Lips and P-Lip, was confirmed by reverse-phase analytical
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in two different mobile
phases (100% methanol and methanol/water 99:1 v/v), and purity was
found to be >95%.

Synthesis of Palmstearin-Based Cationic Lipid
Pool (PS-Lips, Scheme 1A)
Steps a and b: Isolation of Palmstearin Fatty
Acids (Intermediate
“a”, Scheme 1A)
First, fatty acids were isolated from the
vegetable fat, palmstearin, following our previously established protocol.20 Briefly, 10 g of palmstearin (Scheme 1A) was saponificated with 10%
KOH in ethanol (25 mL) in a 250 mL round-bottom flask under refluxing
conditions for 4 h, followed by cooling to room temperature. The volume
of the mixture was reduced to half and washed with water and hexane
(2 × 25 mL each). The aqueous layer containing potassium salt
of fatty acids was collected and acidified with aqueous HCL (30%).
The fatty acid mixture of palmstearin was extracted using ethyl acetate
(4 × 25 mL) followed by brine solution. The organic layer containing
the palmstearin fatty acid mixture was concentrated to yield palmstearin
fatty acid mixture as a white solid with intermediate “a” (Scheme 1A, 9.3 g, Rf = 0.4, 10:90 v/v
ethyl acetate/hexane).

Step c: Preparation of Palmstearin Fatty
Acyl Chlorides (Scheme 1A)
The isolated
fatty acid mixture from palmstearin (10 g, 37.7 mmol, intermediate
“a”, Scheme 1A) was dissolved in a minimum amount of dry dichloromethane
(DCM, 20 mL) with a catalytic amount of dry dimethylformamide, and
oxalyl chloride (3.88 mL, 45.2 mmol) was added slowly drop by drop
at room temperature with continuous stirring for 3 h. The reaction
was stopped after confirming the complete conversion of fatty acids
to their corresponding acid chlorides with thin-layer chromatography.
The excess oxalyl chloride was removed by downward distillation at
40–45 °C. The residue upon vacuum drying afforded fatty
acyl chlorides from palmstearin (10.3 g, 96% yield, Rf = 0.7, 5:95 methanol: chloroform, v/v).

Step d: Synthesis
of Palmstearin-Derived N-Methyl-N,N-diethanolamine Difatty Acyl Esters
(intermediate “b”, Scheme 1A)
N-Methyl-N,N-diethanolamine (1 g, 8.4 mmol) was
added to the fatty acyl chlorides (5.71 g, 20.1 mmol) that were dissolved
in 20 mL of dry DCM, with stirring at room temperature followed by
the slow addition of triethylamine (2.8 mL, 20.1 mmol) at 0 °C
and continued stirring for 12 h at room temperature. After completion
of the reaction, first, the mixture was diluted with 20 mL of DCM
and washed multiple times with 5% aqueous HCl to remove triethylamine.
Next, the organic layer was washed with 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate
solution (3 × 20 mL) followed by brine solution (2 × 20
mL). The combined organic layers were collected, dried over anhydrous
sodium sulphate, and concentrated. The residue was subjected to column
chromatographic purification using silica gel (60–120 mesh
size) with 2% methanol/chloroform, v/v, as the eluent and afforded
the intermediate tertiary amine compound N-methyl-N,N-diethanolamine fatty acyl esters of
palmstearin (intermediate “b”, Scheme 1A) as a brownish
liquid (4.2 g, 82% yield, Rf = 0.8, 5:95
methanol/chloroform, v/v), which solidified upon storage at 4 °C.

Pool (PS-Lips, Scheme 1A)
Finally, N-methyl-N,N-diethanolamine fatty acyl esters of
palmstearin (1.0 g, 1.6 mmol) (intermediate “b”, Scheme 1A) were subjected to quarternization with 2.0 mL of 2-iodoethanol
(excess) under stirring at 80 °C for 6 h. After completion of
the reaction, the mixture was diluted with DCM (20 mL) and washed
with water (3 × 25 mL) followed by brine solution (2 × 20
mL). The combined organic layers were collected, dried over anhydrous
sodium sulfate, and concentrated. The crude residue was subjected
to column chromatographic purification (using 60–120 mesh silica
gel) with 4% methanol/CHCl3, v/v, as the eluent and afforded
the iodide salt of PS-Lips as a yellowish solid. The
counter iodide ion of PS-Lips was exchanged with the
chloride ion on Amberlite IRA 400 chloride resin in the chloroform/methanol
solvent mixture (30:70 v/v) and afforded a white solid of target palmstearin-based
cationic lipid pool (PS-Lips, Scheme 1A, 0.54 g, 48% yield, Rf = 0.2, 5:95 methanol/chloroform, v/v).

Synthesis of Control Palmitic-Based
Cationic Lipid (P-Lip, Scheme 1B)
Step c: Preparation of Palmitoyl Chloride
(Scheme 1B)
Palmitoyl chloride
was prepared using the same procedure as described above for palmstearin
fatty acyl chlorides (step c: preparation of palmstearin fatty acyl
chlorides, Scheme 1A) with 5 g of palmitic acid (starting material “c”, 19.5 mmol) and 2 mL of oxalyl chloride (23.4 mmol) to prepare
its corresponding acid chloride. Palmitoyl chloride (5.1 g) was obtained
with 94% yield (Rf = 0.7, 5:95 methanol/chloroform,
v/v).

Step d: Synthesis of N,N-Di[O-hexadecanoyl-2-hydroxyethyl]-N-methyl
Amine (Intermediate “d”, Scheme 1B)
Tertiary intermediate
was prepared by following the same procedure as described above for
palmstearin fatty acyl esters (step d: synthesis of palmstearin-derived N-methyl-N,N-diethanolamine difatty acyl
esters, intermediate “b”, Scheme 1A) using 6.4 g of palmitoyl
chloride (23.5 mmol, Scheme 1B) and 1 g of N-methyl-N,N-diethanolamine (8.4 mmol) with the addition of
3.27 mL of triethylamine (23.5 mmol). The intermediate tertiary amine
compound N,N-di[O-hexadecanoyl-2-hydroxyethyl]-N-methyl amine was
a yellowish liquid (4.2 g, 84% yield, Rf = 0.8, 5:95 methanol/chloroform, v/v).

Steps e and f: Synthesis of Target N,N-Di[O-hexadecanoyl-2-hydroxyethyl]-N-hydroxy Ethyl-N-methylammonium Chloride
(P-Lip, Scheme 1B)
Target symmetric cationic palmitic lipid, P-Lip, was prepared using the same procedures as described
above for the palmstearin target cationic lipid pool, PS-Lips (step e: synthesis of target palmstearin-based cationic lipid pool, PS-Lips, Scheme 1A). For this, 0.5 g of N,N-di[O-hexadecanoyl-2-hydroxyethyl]-N-methyl
amine (intermediate “d”, 0.83 mmol) was
reacted with 0.6 mL of 2-iodoethanol. The pure target N,N-di[O-hexadecanoyl-2-hydroxyethyl]-N-hydroxy ethyl-N-methyl ammonium chloride
was a white solid (P-Lip, Scheme 1B, 0.25 g, 46% yield, Rf = 0.2, 5:95 methanol/chloroform, v/v).

Measurement of Fatty Acid Composition by
GC
The fatty
acid compositions of the starting material palmstearin and PS-Lips were measured by GC following our previously reported procedure.20 Briefly, 10 mg of palmstearin and PS-Lips in two separate 25 mL round-bottom flasks was dissolved with 5%
H2SO4 in methanol solution and refluxed for
4 h. After 4 h, the contents of the reaction mixture were diluted
with 5 mL of water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The collected
organic layer was washed with brine solution and evaporated to dryness.
The fatty acid methyl ester analysis was performed on a gas chromatograph
(Agilent 6890 series) equipped with a flame ionization detector and
a capillary column DB-23 (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.5 μm
film thickness).

Preparation of Liposomes and pDNA
Liposomes (0.5 mM)
were prepared with 1:1 mol ratios of each lipid and cholesterol using
a standard protocol, as reported previously.20,26,40,41 Briefly, PS-Lips/P-Lip and cholesterol in 1:1 mol ratios
were made into a thin lipid film and hydrated with 1 mL of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated
water overnight. A brief vortex of 2–3 min at room temperature
was followed by sonication using a Branson 450 Sonifier at 100% duty
cycle and 25 W output power to produce small unilamellar vesicles.
The plasmids were amplified in DH5α-strain of Escherichia coli, isolated by alkaline lysis procedure,
and finally purified by PEG-8000 precipitation, as described previously.26 The purity of the plasmid was confirmed by the A260/A280 ratio (around
1.9) and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.

Zeta Potential (ξ)
and Global Size Measurements
Neat liposomes of PS-Lips and P-Lip and
their corresponding lipoplexes across the lipid/DNA charge ratio of
8:1–0.5:1 were subjected to global size and surface charge
measurements using the dynamic laser light scattering method on a
Zetasizer 3000HSA (Malvern UK). The measurements for liposomes
were carried in deionized water (sample refractive index = 1.59 and
viscosity = 0.89). For lipoplexes, the liposomes of PS-Lips and P-Lip were complexed with pDNA in serum-free DMEM
and diluted in the same media for size and zeta potential measurements.
The system was validated by using the 200 + 5 nm polystyrene polymer
(Duke Scientific Corps. Palo Alto, CA). The diameters of particles
(liposomes and lipoplexes) were calculated by using the automatic
mode. Each size measurement was performed at least 10 times in triplicate
(with the zero field correction), and data were tabulated as the average
of 3 measurements. Zeta potentials of each sample was measured at
least 10 times and tabulated as the average values using the Smoluchowski
approximation method for calculation of average values.

DNA-Binding
Assay
PS-Lips and P-Lip liposomes’
DNA-binding ability was assessed with the gel
retardation assay (1% agarose gel prestained with ethidium bromide)
across varying lipid/DNA charge ratios of 8:1 to 0.5:1, as previously
described.11 In brief, pCMV-SPORT-β-gal
(0.3 μg) and the liposomes of PS-Lips and P-Lip were made to complex in a total volume of 30 μL
in N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated at room
temperature for 20–25 min. The samples were loaded into the
wells after mixing with 4 μL of 6× loading buffer [prepared
using 0.25% bromophenol blue in 40% (w/v) sucrose with sterile H2O]. A power of 80 V was used for 45 min in running the gel,
and DNA bands were visualized in a Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR + imaging system
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

pDNA Transfection Biology
Cells were seeded at a density
of 15 000 (for COS-1, CHO, B16F10, and HepG2) per well in a
96-well plate 12–18 h before the transfection experiments.
Lipoplexes were prepared using pDNA (0.3 μg) with the liposomes
of PS-Lips and P-Lip at a 0.5:1 to 8:1 lipid/DNA
charge ratio (0.45–7.2 nmol) in serum-free media to a final
volume of 100 μL for 30 min. The prepared lipoplexes were added
to the cells and incubated for 3–4 h. After incubation period,
the media containing the lipoplexes were replaced with complete media.
After 36–48 h of incubation, the reporter gene activity was
estimated using our previously reported method.26 Briefly, after the incubation time, the cells were washed
with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the media and
lysed using lysis buffer of 50 μL per well (prepared with 0.25
M Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, added with 0.5% NP40). The reporter gene activity
(β-galactosidase activity) was estimated with the addition of
substrate solution of 50 μL per well [prepared by dissolving
1.33 mg of ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside
(ONPG), 0.2 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.3), and 2 mM MgCl2 in 1 mL volume] into a 96-well plate containing the lysate. Absorbance
was measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader, and the transfection
efficiency was calculated (as β-galactosidase units) using a
calibration curve (obtained with pure β-galactosidase enzyme).
The transfection experiments were performed in triplicate, and the
transfection efficacies of PS-Lips, P-Lip, and Lipofectamine 2000 are represented as the average of triplicate
experiments.

mRNA Transfection Studies
Cells
were seeded at a density
of 25 000/well (for HEK-293) and 40 000/well (HEL-1
and K-562 in a 48-well plate at least 12 h before the transfection
experiments). mRNA plexes were prepared using 0.25 μg of GFP
encoding mRNA with varying amounts of liposomes of PS-Lips and P-Lip (1.8–7.2 nmol at a 2:1 to 8:1 lipid/mRNA
charge ratio) in serum-free DMEM to a final volume of 100 μL
for 30 min. Commercially available RNAi MAX transfection reagent was
used for transfection as per manufacture protocol. The complexes were
then added to the cells and incubated for 3–4 h. After incubation
period, the media containing the lipoplexes were replaced with complete
media. GFP expression imaging was done using a fluorescence microscope
(Leica DMI 6000B) and quantified in FACS (BD Biosciences Calibur).

Cellular Uptake Studies
Cellular uptake studies of
lipoplexes were performed in CHO cell lines, stably expressing GPI-anchored
GFP (a gift from Prof. Satyajit Mayor, NCBS, India) using the established
protocols.26 In brief, rhodamine-PE labelled
liposomes, 0.5 mM liposomes (PS-Lips and P-Lip) were prepared in amber glass vials, as described in the above section
of “Preparation of Liposomes” with an additional step
of adding 0.005 mM rhodamine-PE (i.e., 1% with respect to the total
formulation content, Avanti Polar Lipids, USA). GPI-anchored GFP CHO
cells (10 000) were seeded in a 96-well plate (Corning Inc.,
Corning, NY) in 100 μL of DMEM medium 12–18 h before
the transfection experiment. Rhodamine-PE labelled liposomes of PS-Lips and P-Lip were complexed with pCMV-SPORT-β-gal
(0.3 μg/well) at a lipid/DNA charge ratio of 2:1 (total volume
of 100 μL DMEM) for 15–20 min. The complexes were then
added to the cells and incubated for 3–4 h. After 4 h of incubation,
the nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole,
and the cells were washed with PBS (2100 μL) and fixed with
3.8% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. The red
fluorescent cells were detected under an inverted fluorescence microscope
(Nikon, Japan).

Plasmid Expression Studies
For GFP
expression studies,
12–18 h before transfection, 4 × 104 HEK-293
cells were seeded in 24-well plates (Corning Inc., NY). Liposomes
of PS-Lips and P-Lip were made to complex
with eGFP-N1-encoding pDNA or pL-CRISPR.EFS.GFP (0.9 μg/well)
at a 2:1 lipid/DNA charge ratio in serum-free DMEM (total volume made
up to 100 μL) for 15–20 min. The final volumes of the
complexes were made to 400 μL with DMEM and added to the cells.
After 4 h of incubation, the lipoplexes were removed, and the cells
were supplemented with complete medium. Post 36 h of transfections,
the cells were washed with PBS (100 μL) and fixed with 3.8%
paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. eGFP-N1 expression
was observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan).

Cell Viability Assay
MTT-based colorimetric reduction
assay was performed to evaluate the cell viabilities for lipoplexes
prepared using liposomes of PS-Lips and P-Lip and pDNA (pCMV-SPORT-β-gal) in CHO cells at varying lipid/DNA
charge ratios (8:1–0.5:1), as reported previously.20 The conditions for the MTT assay were maintained
same with respect to the cell number per well and the lipid/DNA charge
ratio as used for transfection experiments described in “pDNA Transfection Biology” section. Briefly,
following the addition of lipoplexes for 4 h, the media were replaced
with complete media and incubated for another 24 h. After 24 h of
incubation, MTT (5 mg/mL prepared in PBS) was added to the cells and
incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the supernatant
was removed carefully. The purple formazan crystals were dissolved
in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/methanol (1:1 v/v). The absorbance was
measured using a microplate reader. The results were expressed as
percent viability = [A540 (treated cells)
– background/A540 (untreated cells)
– background] × 100.

FRET Assay
The
membrane fusogenicities of PS-Lips and P-Lip liposomes were measured with a dual fluorophore
labelled membrane model, as described previously.20,33 In brief, the model biomembrane lipid composition containing DOPC/DOPE/DOPS/Chol
(45:20:20:15, w/w ratio, the total lipid concentration used was 0.5
mM) was labelled with 0.005 mM NBD-PE (acts as donor) and N-Rho-PE
(acts as an acceptor) lipids (i.e., 1% with respect to the total biomembrane
mimicking formulation content, Avanti Polar Lipids, USA). Fusogenicity
experiment was performed by adding a labelled model biomembrane liposomal
formulation and PS-Lips and P-Lip liposomes
in a black 96-well plate; they were mixed well, and readings were
taken in a FLx800 Microplate Fluorescence Reader (BioTek Instruments
Inc., U.K.) at room temperature. Starting from 0 to 30 min, for every
5 min, fluorescence intensities were recorded by exciting the sample
at 485 nm and emitting at 595 nm. The fluorescent intensity of each
time interval (Ft) was
normalized with the initial intensity (Fo) and infinity intensity (Fα) of
the model membrane by fitting in the equation [Fo – Ft/Fo – Fα] × 100. Infinity fusion (100%) was determined by the emission
of Rho-PE fluorescent intensity after the complete dissociation of
the labeled biomembrane liposomal formulation with 1% Triton X-100.

Endocytosis Blocking
HEK-293 cells (6 × 104) were seeded in a 24 well plate 22–24 h before the
experiment. Prior to the addition of the lipoplexes, the respective
cells were pretreated with plain DMEM containing sucrose (450 nM),
methyl-β-cyclodextrin (2 mM), dynasore (80 μM), and nystatin
(80 μM) individually for 30 min. The medium was then removed
and replaced with DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.
The lipoplexes were then added to the cells, and the cells were incubated
at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The reporter gene activity was
quantified after 48 h using flow cytometric analysis.
