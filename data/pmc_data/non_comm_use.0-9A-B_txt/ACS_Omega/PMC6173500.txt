Protein tyrosine sulfation (PTS),
catalyzed by membrane-anchored
tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST), is one of the most common
post-translational modifications of secretory and transmembrane proteins.
PTS, a key modulator of extracellular protein–protein interactions,
accounts for various important biological activities, namely, virus
entry, inflammation, coagulation, and sterility. The preparation and
characterization of TPST is fundamental for understanding the synthesis
of tyrosine-sulfated proteins and for studying PTS in biology. A sulfated
protein was prepared using a TPST-coupled protein sulfation system
that involves the generation of the active sulfate 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate
(PAPS) through either PAPS synthetase (PAPSS) or phenol sulfotransferase.
The preparation of sulfated proteins was confirmed through radiometric
or immunochemical assays. In this study, enzymatically active Drosophila melanogaster TPST (DmTPST) and human TPSTs
(hTPST1 and hTPST2) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) host cells and purified to homogeneity in high yield.
Our results revealed that recombinant DmTPST was particularly useful
considering its catalytic efficiency and ease of preparation in large
quantities. This study provides tools for high-efficiency, one-step
synthesis of sulfated proteins and peptides that are useful for further
deciphering the mechanisms, functions, and future applications of
PTS.

==== Body
Introduction
Protein tyrosine sulfation
(PTS), one of the most common post-translational
modifications (PTMs), was first reported in 1954.1 PTS occurs in the trans-Golgi network, and the sulfated
proteins and peptides are typically transmembrane or secretory proteins.2 Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) (Enzyme
Commission number: 2.8.2.20) is a type II membrane enzyme that is
delineated to transfer the sulfuryl group from 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate
(PAPS) onto a specific tyrosine residue within target proteins and
peptides. This reaction is widespread in multicellular eukaryotic
organisms, and TPST can be detected in most tissues and cell types
in humans and rats.3,4 Total sulfated proteins were speculated
to account for approximately 1% of tyrosine residues in an organism.5 To date, approximately 300 proteins are identified
to be sulfated proteins.6 Most of these
proteins and peptides have been implicated in the intracellular trafficking
and proteolytic processing of secreted proteins. The sulfate group
can be recognized through PTS and has been identified as a key modulator
of extracellular protein–protein interactions (PPIs), which
involve hormonal regulation, hemostasis, inflammation, and infectious
diseases.6−8 PTM is believed to alter the strength of PPIs and
further modulate ligand–receptor binding, intercellular communication,
and signaling.2,9,10 A
recent proteome chip study showed that sulfated proteins can be prepared
on a chip by a TPST-catalyzed reaction.11

The preparation of TPST from Golgi-enriched membrane fractions
was reported previously.12 However, both
TPSTs (TPST1 and TPST2) were likely to be copurified from the procedures,
and methods for separating TPST1 and TPST2 have not been reported.13 Moreover, the concentration of TPSTs is not
high in the original crude extract, and TPSTs in a mixture may affect
the efficiency of PTS. The preparation of recombinant TPSTs can markedly
increase the concentration of the target enzyme and also ensure the
preparation of the desired enzyme. TPSTs in humans and mice have been
reported to be first identified through molecular cloning.14−16 Since then, similar studies have revealed recombinant TPSTs in other
species, namely, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, Caenorhabditis
elegans, and Arabidopsis thaliana.17−20

PTS is crucial for regulating various biological reactions
and
has become a target for drug design. A sulfated chemokine receptor
(C–C chemokine receptor type 5, CCR5) interacts with envelope
glycoprotein 120 (gp120) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1),
which facilitates HIV-1 entry into cells. Tyrosine-sulfated peptides
derived from gp120 potently block HIV-1 entry by mimicking the N-terminus
structure of CCR5.21 The salivary gland
of leech secretes hirudin, a potent anticoagulant protein. PTS on
hirudin enhances its interaction with thrombin, and sulfated hirudin
has become an effective drug for preventing thrombin-induced blood
coagulation.22 The preparation of sulfated
proteins and peptides is essential for studying PTS-related diseases. Table 1 summarizes methods
for preparing sulfated proteins and peptides.

Commercially available sulfated
peptides are prepared through 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-based
solid-phase peptide synthesis involving sulfotyrosine residues.23 This chemical synthesis method reveals the exact
position of the sulfated tyrosine residue in a peptide. The procedure
involves cumbersome protection and deprotection of functional groups
and is thus limited to the synthesis of small peptides. Moreover,
acidic deprotection conditions often result in desulfation, which
complicate the preparation of multiple sulfotyrosine residues in a
peptide.23 Non-native sulfated peptides
that may not exist in a biological system can also be obtained using
this method. A study expanded the genetic code method and reported
the direct cotranslational expression of sulfated tyrosine proteins
in Escherichia coli.24 The PTS site can be specifically designed by introducing
the amber nonsense codon to encode a sulfated tyrosine residue. In
contrast to the previously described chemical synthesis of sulfated
peptides, this method is favorable for synthesizing mid-sized proteins
but not small peptides. In addition, the expanded genetic code method
requires cumbersome procedures for plasmid construction, sulfotyrosyl
t-RNA synthesis, and E. coli modification.
The efficient expression of the sulfated protein is also challenging
because the sulfated protein may affect the E. coli growth.24 Another method for producing
biologically active sulfated proteins has been developed by implanting
an artificial PTS system in E. coli.25 This prokaryotic sulfated protein-generating
system involves the coexpression of two plasmids: one pertaining to
the expression of the PTS system and the other pertaining to the expression
of the target protein. The implementation of this system requires
only standard molecular biology techniques; however, the expression
of the sulfated protein may have limitations similar to those described
for the expanded genetic code method. Therefore, an efficient and
direct method is required for the in vitro production of biologically
active proteins and peptides. The sulfated proteins and peptides can
be monitored using radioactive, immunochemical, and fluorescent assays.26−29,17

In this study, we prepared
recombinant TPSTs that catalyze the
proteins and peptides in PTS with high efficiency. The P-selectin
glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) peptide or its fusion protein was used
as the target for PTS reaction.13,17,18,25 PSGL-1 is a glycoprotein found
on the plasma membrane of neutrophils or monocytes. There are three
potential tyrosine sulfation sites at the amino terminus of PSGL-1.30 To rapidly obtain substrates of high purity,
tyrosine substrates were purified using the glutathione S-transferase
(GST) fusion tag. The PTS level was negligible on GST, and the TPST
activity on GST–PSGL-1 was not affected by the GST fusion tag
(Figure S1). The GST fusion tag could be
an excellent tool for the purification of other types of PTS substrates.31,32 According to the catalyst efficiency results, we established an
optimal sulfated protein and peptide system. Herein, we report the
in vitro synthesis of sulfated proteins and peptides by using a coupled
enzyme system that does not involve cumbersome chemical synthesis
and may avoid uncertainties in a cell. This system requires enzymes
to catalyze the synthesis of activated sulfate compounds and the transfer
of the activated compounds to the target proteins and peptides. The
final sulfated proteins and peptides can be synthesized by simply
incubating all required ingredients in a batch. Thus, this method
is a direct and easy process for preparing biologically active sulfated
proteins and peptides.

Results and Discussion
Sequence Comparison among
hTPST1, hTPST2, and DmTPST
All known TPST-containing organisms,
except for D.
melanogaster, have two TPSTs.2,16 Notably,
these TPSTs differ in their sequence and enzymatic properties. We
selected three TPSTs in our study. Figure 1 shows the protein sequences of hTPST1, hTPST2,
and DmTPST, which share approximately 60% identity with a similar
length. Both hTPSTs and DmTPST show α-helical transmembrane
proteins comprising highly hydrophobic domains in the amino terminus.
According to the topological analysis of the primary sequence (Figure 1), the transmembrane
region is marked in red on the N terminus of TPSTs. The transmembrane
regions have low sequence identity (Figure 1), which increases to approximately 75% among
these TPSTs after the exclusion of this domain sequence. Truncated
hTPST2 without the transmembrane domain has been reported to be secreted
by stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.14,15 Human and rat TPSTs have been identified and characterized in human
saliva and rat submandibular salivary glands, respectively.33,34 The hydrophobic domain is likely to reduce the protein solubility
and thus interfere with protein folding and purification. In our study,
the hydrophobic transmembrane domains of hTPSTs and DmTPST were truncated,
and only the catalytic domains of the TPSTs were expressed.

Figure 1 Sequence analysis
of TPSTs from humans and D. melanogaster. The pairwise sequence alignment was performed by ClustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html) and sorted and shaded by the BOXSHADE web server (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). The black background indicates identical amino acids, and the
gray one indicates conserved substitutions. The residue colored in
red is the predicted transmembrane domain calculated by PSIPRED (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/psiform.html) and ranged from residues 6 to 28 for both human TPST1 and TPST2
and from 12 to 28 for D. melanogaster TPST. The pairwise sequence identities of these TPSTs were 57, 56,
and 65% for DmTPST–hTPST1, DmTPST–hTPST2, and hTPST1–hTPST2,
respectively. In the absence of the transmembrane region, the sequence
identity of the catalysis domain increased to approximately 75%.

Expression and Purification
of Recombinant TPSTs
To
facilitate the expression and purification of stable and active TPSTs,
we removed the TPST transmembrane domain and fused it with various
tags and fusion proteins with expression vectors (Table 2). In our study, the highest
expression of soluble TPSTs was achieved using the pET-43.1a expression
vector that contains N-utilization substance protein A (NusA) insertion.
In hTPST2 construction, we closed the his-tag on the 5′ end
of pET-43.1a for complete expression. The prokaryotic expression condition
was further optimized at 20 °C for 24 h to achieve the maximal
soluble amount of TPST and was purified to near homogeneity (Figure 2). Similar results
were obtained for the expression and purification of NusA–hTPST1,
NusA–hTPST2, and NusA–DmTPST. In this paper, the NusA-fusion
TPSTs are abbreviated for DmTPST, hTPST1, and hTPST2. In a typical
experiment, 15.3 mg (DmTPST), 5.7 mg (hTPST1), and 4 mg (hTPST2) of
the purified TPST fusion proteins were obtained from 1 L cell culture (Table 3). This is the first
detailed report on the expression and purification of active recombinant
TPSTs prepared from prokaryotic expression. Prokaryotic expressions
of TPST reported previously resulted in an inactive form and refolding
is needed.35,36 TPSTs have been expressed in
many eukaryotic systems such as HEK293-T, CHO, and SF9 insect cells
and yeast.14,15,20,37 The prokaryotic expression system generally
provides high expression of the target protein; in addition, the plasmid
can be easily constructed for the expression of heterologous enzymes.
It has been shown that coexpression of the enzyme system and the protein
substrate can be achieved in the same prokaryotic expression system
and the sulfated protein is produced simultaneously.25 This system can be very useful for both academic researchers
and the future industrial applications to produce desired properly
sulfate-modified proteins.

b Enzyme activity was measured based
on the PAPSS–TPST coupled enzyme assay by ELISA, with GST–PSGL-1
serving as the substrate. The total activity was calculated according
to the specific activity results.

c The specific activity was determined
according to the results of the HRP-produced signal per minute at
OD450nm. GST–PSGL-1 was used as the substrate; the
TPST reaction time and amount were 60 min and 10 μg, respectively.

d The purification yield was
calculated
according to the total activity results.

In this study, DmTPST was observed to yield superior
results in
terms of the total enzyme and its activity. Furthermore, we observed
that NusA is critical in the recombinant fused TPST protein not only
for promoting its expression but also for strengthening its stability
(Figure S2 and Table S2). Thus, NusA-fused TPSTs are suitable for the large-scale
synthesis of sulfated proteins/peptides in vitro that often requires
prolonged incubation time. In particular, we found that DmTPST is
a suitable catalyst for organic synthesis because its enzymatic activity
and quantity following prokaryotic expression were much higher than
those of NusA-fused human TPSTs (Table 3).

Enzymatic Synthesis of Sulfated Proteins/Peptides
Figure 3 shows two
schemes,
both of which exploit coupled enzyme activities to accumulate the
PAPS sulfonate donor that was subsequently used to generate TPST-catalyzed
sulfated proteins/peptides. TPST activity was frequently evaluated
using the radioactive-labeled PAPS; however, commercial PAPS is typically
contaminated with considerable amounts of PAP.38 PAP is a potent product inhibitor of many sulfotransferases,
and it might engender a low catalytic efficiency of TPSTs, as previously
reported.25 In the first PAPSS–TPST
scheme (Figure 3A),
PAPSS was used to catalyze the generation of PAPS from ATP and SO42–.39,40 The advantage of this
method is that the radioactive-labeled PAPS and the resulting sulfated
proteins/peptides can be obtained directly from inorganic sulfate.
The enzyme kinetics of TPST was also determined easily by the PAPSS–TPST
system. Figure 3B presents
the second scheme for the preparation of sulfated proteins/peptides.
In such a scheme, PAPS is regenerated through phenol sulfotransferase-catalyzed
MUS and PAP.41 The advantage of this method
is that the progress of protein sulfation can be continuously monitored
by a fluorometer because of the production of 4-methylumbilliferone
(MU), a fluogenic compound, from MUS.17 Excess phenol sulfotransferase was included in the reaction mixture
to catalyze the transfer of the sulfonate group from MUS to PAP and
to regenerate PAPS required for PTS. Thus, the increase in the fluorescence
signal of MU (excitation: 360 nm and emission peak: 450 nm) reflects
the amount of PTS. Unlike the previous scheme, the concentration of
PAPS can be stably controlled under this assay condition. According
to Chen et al., this factor makes the second scheme an excellent strategy
for determining the enzyme kinetics of TPSTs.17 In principle, both approaches (Figure 3) could eventually yield the desired sulfated
proteins/peptides; however, their efficiencies could markedly vary
in prolonged reaction times that are often required for synthesizing
a large amount of enzymatic products. Most enzymatic activities are
determined at their initial reaction stage to avoid various complications
following enzymatic reactions, such as the change in substrate–product
concentration and stability of enzymes. Such complications are likely
to occur in the two coupled enzyme systems. Because the objective
of the present study was to synthesize sulfated proteins, we further
developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for identifying sulfated
proteins and compared the efficacy of the two schemes for synthesizing
sulfated proteins.

Figure 3 Preparation of sulfated protein by two types of coupled
enzyme
systems. (A) PAPSS–TPST coupled PTS. Activated sulfate in PAPS
was first obtained from inorganic sulfate and ATP catalyzed by PAPSS.
The sulfated protein was prepared from PAPS and a protein substrate
catalyzed by TPST. Radioactive sulfate can be used to produce radioactive-labeled
sulfated proteins. (B) Phenol sulfotransferase–TPST coupled
PTS. PAPS is regenerated from PAP and MUS catalyzed by phenol sulfotransferase
to produce MU that yields fluorescence.

Identification of Recombinant Sulfated Proteins for High-Throughput
Screening with ELISA
The aforementioned methods for detecting
protein/peptide sulfation are typically designed for monitoring TPST
activity in a short period during the initial linear production of
sulfated proteins/peptides. A longer incubation time may be required
to obtain near completion of the final sulfated products. In this
study, ELISA was observed to efficiently detect and characterize the
final sulfated proteins through a PTS scheme similar to the aforementioned
scheme. The ELISA detection of the sulfated proteins can be performed
conveniently in an ELISA plate and determined using anti-sulfotyrosine
and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies by
incubating with TMB. GST–PSGL-1 was first coated on an ELISA
plate, which was subsequently blocked with milk. The PTS reaction
and control experiment were subsequently conducted. All reagents required
can be included in a one-pot reaction by either of the two schemes
(Figure 3). Figure 4 shows that the sulfated
proteins could be obtained only by using a complete reaction mixture
in either the PAPSS–TPST or phenol sulfotransferase–TPST
system. Negative results were obtained in the absence of both TPSTs,
the protein substrate, indicating that the sulfated proteins were
obtained through either the PAPSS–TPST or phenol sulfotransferase–TPST
system and were recognized by the anti-sulfotyrosine antibody. Figure S3 shows the progress curve of PTS using
various amounts of TPST. Data provided in Table S1 show the effect of substrate concentration on ELISA readings.
The purpose of ELISA in our research is to quickly determine the reaction
conditions for TPST and also used as a second method to confirm the
protein sulfation. Figure 4 demonstrates that sulfated proteins could also be determined
by ELISA. The amount of TPST used for catalyzing the reaction given
in the figure legend and were determined according to our previous
results shown in Figure S3 and Table S1. The PTS results determined by ELISA
were consistent with those obtained using fluorescence17 and radioactive (Figure 6) methods. However, ELISA is more direct
and convenient for determining PTS following long incubation times.
The enzymatic activity can be more conveniently determined using the
fluorescent assay (Figure 3B). The radioactive assay is cumbersome but favorable for
obtaining direct evidence and confirming the transfer of the sulfate
group from inorganic sulfate to PAPS and to the sulfated protein.

Figure 4 In situ
determination of two PTS schemes by ELISA. GST–PSGL-1
was coated on an ELISA plate, which was subsequently blocked with
milk. The immobilized GST–PSGL-1 was then treated with the
PAPSS–TPST or phenol sulfotransferase–TSPT system. Control
experiments in the absence of each critical ingredient, GST–PSGL-1,
and TPST were conducted to confirm that the PTS reaction on the target
protein proceeded as expected. The sulfated proteins/peptides were
recognized by anti-sulfotyrosine antibody, as described in the Materials and Methods section. The specific activity
was determined according to the results of the HRP-produced signal
per minute at OD450nm, and the DmTPST reaction time and
amount were 60 min and 10 μg, respectively. Each data point
was obtained from three independent measurements, and the error bar
indicates standard deviation (SD).

Comparison of the PTS Efficiency of Two Coupled Enzyme System
Sulfation Schemes with Three Recombinant TPSTs in a Long Incubation
Period
In a long incubation period, an enzyme-catalyzed reaction
may differ from a reaction with a short reaction time because of various
factors such as the stability of enzymes, accumulation of products
that may become inhibitory at higher concentrations (Ki), and change in substrate concentration (Km) that can significantly affect Vmax. Prolonged incubation in such systems may yield excess
amounts of PAP, which inhibits various sulfotransferases.42 The described PTS schemes were previously used13 for determining the initial rate as a characteristic
of the kinetics of TPSTs. However, a long incubation time will likely
be required to prepare sulfated proteins. We compared the efficiency
of the two sulfation schemes in a long reaction time (Figure 5). We coated 1 μg of
GST–PSGL-1 at a volume of 100 μL on the ELISA plate,
which was subsequently blocked with milk. PTS was conducted for 0–150
min by using either the PAPSS–TPST or phenol sulfotransferase–TPST
system. We compared the PTS efficiency of orthologous TPSTs (Figure 5) and observed that
the PTS efficiency of DmTPST was higher than that of hTPSTs on the
GST–PSGL-1 substrate. The sulfated GST–PSGL-1 was generated
by DmTPST in a short time (approximately 5 min), but hTPSTs required
more incubation time. Most species have two types of TPSTs to catalyze
PTS, except for D. melanogaster, which
has only one TPST. The two types of TPSTs might have a competitive
or regulatory relationship, influencing the specificity and sensitivity
of the substrate. Our results indicated that DmTPST maintained a high
PTS efficiency for a substrate from a different species. In the same
figure, the PTS efficiency levels of DmTPST in the two coupled enzyme
systems were compared. GST–PSGL-1 has three tyrosine residues
at the 46, 48, and 51 positions, and its PTS efficiency was different
at these residues. We calculated the yield of sulfated GST–PSGL-1
at 5 min by plotting a calibration curve. The amount of sulfated GST–PSGL-1
produced coincided with that of GST–PSGL-1 used for immobilization.
The signal of sulfated GST–PSGL-1 in the PAPSS–TPST-coupled
enzyme system continued to increase; however, the signal of the sulfated
GST–PSGL-1 in the phenol sulfotransferase–TPST system
was constant after 5 min. Therefore, the PTS reaction occurs at more
than one tyrosine residue in the PAPSS–TPST system but only
at one tyrosine residue in the phenol sulfotransferase–TPST
system. In the PTS reaction of GST–PSGL-1, the enzyme-catalyzed
reaction may behave differently for these residues because of various
factors such as PAPS or substrate concentration that markedly affects
the PTS efficiency. The phenol sulfotransferase–TPST system
does not exist in organisms, and a high concentration of PAPS may
cause inhibition. However, the PAPSS–TPST system is present
in organisms; PAPSS generates PAPS from inorganic sulfate, and PAPS
continues to be consumed in the PTS reaction. Therefore, the PAPSS–TPST
system has a lower inhibition response than does the phenol sulfotransferase–TPST
system. The effects of the two coupled enzyme systems on different
tyrosine residues will be further clarified in future studies. Finally,
the sulfated product was observed to be generated by DmTPST and the
PAPSS–TPST system.

Figure 5 PTS under long incubation time. PTS was determined
by ELISA, as
described in Figure 4, which was conducted from 5 to 150 min by using either the PAPSS–TPST
or phenol sulfotransferase–TPST system. Three recombinant enzymes,
DmTPST (circle dot), hTPST1 (triangle dot), and hTPST2 (square dot),
were examined. The reaction condition was the same as that described
in Figure 4, except
for the reaction time. PTS by the PAPSS–TPST system is shown
as filled dots and that by the phenol sulfotransferase–TPST
system is shown as open dots. The total activity was determined according
to the HRP-produced signal per minute at OD450nm, and the
TPST reaction amount was 10 μg. The mole of sulfated products
was calculated by plotting the standard curve of sulfated GST–PSGL-1
in terms of the HRP-produced signal per minute at OD450nm. Each data point was obtained from three independent measurements,
and the error bar indicates SD.

Yield and Purification of Sulfated GST–PSGL-1
According
to previous reports, the preparation of TPST for synthesizing
sulfated proteins/peptides is expensive and difficult.43 The sulfated GST–PSGL-1 generated by
DmTPST and the PAPSS–TPST system, as reported in the previous
section, was further confirmed using a traditional radioactive method.
We used GST–PSGL-1 and PSGL-1 as samples to prepare 35S-labeled sulfated proteins (Figure 6). The result revealed
that the sulfated proteins could be obtained only from a PTS reaction
mixture (lanes 3 and 7, Figure 6). In the absence of either the protein substrate (lane 1, Figure 6) or TPST (lanes
2, 4, and 6, Figure 6), the reaction yielded only negative results. The GST protein (lanes
4 and 5, Figure 6)
was not a TPST substrate and therefore also showed negative results.
These data strongly indicate that the 35S-labeled sulfated
protein obtained by this reaction scheme was synthesized from 35S inorganic sulfate. Figure 7A shows that the yield of sulfated GST–PSGL-1
markedly increased after the PTS reaction. SDS–PAGE was the
internal control for ensuring the protein quantity in each well. Western
blotting revealed GST–PSGL-1 (lane N) and sulfated GST–PSGL-1
(lane P) as the negative and positive controls, respectively. The
amount of sulfated GST–PSGL-1 was found decreasing after 180
min probably due to the high concentration of the product. The sulfated
compounds are known to be labile, and sulfotransferase may catalyze
the reverse reaction.44 It is proposed
that, following the long incubation period, the accumulation of the
sulfated GST–PSGL-1 became decreasing because of its low stability
in aqueous solution. In addition, possible reverse reactions catalyzed
by the enzyme system may also eliminate the sulfated compounds in
long incubation period because of the change of the balance between
substrate and product. However, the catalytic mechanism of the sulfotransferase-catalyzed
nonphysiologic reverse reaction has not been studied to a significant
extent. The positive control signal was stronger than the PAPSS–TPST
reaction signal because the sulfated GST–PSGL-1 had been purified.
The mixed reagent also affected the sulfated GST–PSGL-1 signal,
as observed through western blotting. GST–PSGL-1 was allowed
to react for 180 min to maximize the product yield. Next, the PTS
reactant was diluted and reloaded into the GSTrap column; the purification
procedure executed using the GSTrap sepharose column was repeated
(the detailed procedure is described in the Materials
and Methods section). The sulfated GST–PSGL-1 determined
through native PAGE (pH 8.0) is shown in Figure 7B. The sulfated GST–PSGL-1 was further
confirmed by ELISA (Figure 7C); the results revealed homogeneous sulfated GST–PSGL-1.
Any PTS substrate could be catalyzed using the coupled enzyme system
and then further purified.

The 35S-labeled substrate yielded radioactive sulfate from
PAPS synthesized in situ from 35S-containing inorganic
sulfate. Lanes “–substrate (+TPST),” “PSGL-1
(−TPST),” “GST (−TPST),” and “GST–PSGL-1
(−TPST)” were the negative controls, indicating controlled
reactions in the absence of one such component from the complete reaction
mixture. Lanes “PSGL-1 (+TPST),” “GST (+TPST),”
and “GST–PSGL-1 (+TPST)” contained a complete
reaction mixture, as described in the Materials and
Methods section for the sulfation of the substrate. The arrowheads
indicate the spot of [35S] sulfated proteins/peptides.
The bottom spots indicate unreacted [35S] sulfate and [35S] PAPS.

Conclusions
In
this study, we purified large quantities of homogenous TPSTs
from D. melanogaster and humans for
sulfated GST–PSGL-1 synthesis. Coupled enzyme methods were
used to generate sulfated GST–PSGL-1, which was subsequently
detected using ELISA. Our results on the synthesis of sulfated proteins/peptides
can contribute to studies on PTS-induced PPIs. Furthermore, the coupled
enzyme methods can be observed through radiometry and fluorimetry.
ELISA could facilitate the large-scale screening of the potential
substrate and optimization of reaction conditions. Radiometry could
accurately examine substrate candidates. Fluorimetry could enable
the real-time and rapid detection of the product at the preliminary
stage. These methods can be combined to generate and detect sulfated
products and are not limited by the size or number of substrates.
Our findings reveal that DmTPST is a highly efficient enzyme and that
the PAPSS–TPST system is an optimal method for sulfated GST–PSGL-1
synthesis. The synthesis of sulfated proteins/peptides not only facilitates
studying the basic biochemical mechanisms of TPST but also provides
materials for PTS-induced PPIs. The study results can be used to explain
the physiological function of PTS in the future.

a The primers used for clone constructs
were designed for the catalytic domain in each TPST. The transmembrane
domains predicted by the PSIPRED web server were truncated in this
study.

b The restriction sites
of the sticky
ends are underlined in each primer.

Sequence Alignment and Transmembrane Domain Analysis of TPSTs
The transmembrane region and orientation of TPSTs were predicted
by PSIPRED (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/psiform.html).45 Only the hydrophobicity scores exceeding 0 were
considered significant to be the potential transmembrane region. The
multiple sequence alignment was performed by the RE-MuSiC software
tool (http://bioalgorithm.life.nctu.edu.tw/RE-MUSIC/),46 and the sequence identity scores
were calculated by ClustalW2 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/).47 The alignment results were sorted
and shaded by the BOXSHADE web server (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html).

Clones of TPSTs and Their Substrates
The genes of human
TPST1 (hTPST1) and TPST2 (hTPST2) as well as DmTPST were subcloned
into the pET-43.1a vector. The predicted catalytic domain of TPSTs
was amplified by PCR by using specific primers (Table 4). The oligonucleotides were designed to
contain BamHI (hTPST1 and hTPST2) or EcoRI (DmTPST) restriction sites in the forward direction and the XhoI restriction site in the reverse direction. The cDNA
fragments were inserted into the BamHI–XhoI or EcoRI–XhoI double restriction sites and subsequently confirmed through sequencing
with an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA), following the standard protocol. The specific primers (Table 4) were designed to
produce self-annealed cDNA encoding the N-terminal region of PSGL-1
(ATEYEYLDYDFL). The self-annealed oligonucleotides were subcloned
into the BamHI–XhoI restriction
site of pGEX-4T-1 for prokaryotic expression.

Expression and Purification
of TPSTs and Their Substrates
A single colony of BL21(DE3)
includes TPSTs; GST–PSGL-1
plasmids were inoculated in Luria–Bertani broth with ampicillin
as the antibiotic at 37 °C. BL21(DE3) was allowed to grow to
an OD600nm of 0.4–0.6 and then induced with 1 mM
isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG), followed by
incubation for 24 h at 20 °C. The bacterial cultures were harvested
through centrifugation and then homogenized with ice-cold HisTrap
buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, and
10% glycerol) for TPST and ice-cold GSTrap buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl
at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol) for GST–PSGL-1.
The crude homogenates were centrifuged at 30 000 g for 30 min, and
the collected supernatants were individually fractionated using HisTrap
and GSTrap sepharose columns. Furthermore, TPST was eluted with 50
mL HisTrap buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 300 mM
imidazole, and 10% glycerol), and GST–PSGL-1 was eluted with
50 mL GSTrap buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 10 mM glutathione). The mixture of PTS-treated
(PAPSS–TPST or phenol sulfotransferase–TPST coupled
enzyme system) GST–PSGL-1 (i.e., sulfated GST–PSGL-1)
was diluted 10-fold with ice-cold GSTrap buffer A. The diluted solution
was reloaded into the GSTrap sepharose column, and the column loaded
with glutathione was used to elute the sulfated GST–PSGL-1.
The purity of the proteins was determined through SDS–PAGE,
and the sulfated GST–PSGL-1 was further determined through
8% native PAGE in pH 8.0.

Preparation and Determination of Isotope 35S-Labeled
Sulfated Protein Catalyzed Using the PAPSS–TPST System
PTS on GST–PSGL-1 (containing the PSGL-1 peptide at the N-terminal)
and PSGL-1 peptide (ATEYEYLDYDFL) was catalyzed using
the PAPSS–TPST system, and the PTS degree was monitored using 35S. The complete reaction mixture included a TPST substrate
(either 120 μM GST–PSGL-1 or 120 μM PSGL-1 in this
study), 4 mM Na2[35S]SO4, 1 mM ATP,
5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 mM MES buffer (pH
6.5), 5 μg recombinant PAPS synthetase (PAPSS), 4 μg DmTPST,
and 0.5 U pyrophosphatase in a final volume of 20 μL. The PTS
degree was examined by spotting 1 μL aliquot of the reaction
mixture on a cellulose TLC plate and developing the plate with n-butanol/pyridine/formic acid/water (5:4:1:3, by volume)
as the solvent system. The dried plate was exposed to a Kodak BioMax
MR film, which provided the optimal resolution for 35S
autoradiography. The photographic plate was exposed to overlap through
cellulose TLC. A liquid scintillation analyzer was used to detect
the sulfation site in terms of the number of counts per minute.

Preparation and Determination of Sulfated Proteins Catalyzed
Using the Phenol Sulfotransferase–TPST System
The
complete reaction included 50 mM MES buffer (pH 6.5), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol,
30 μM PAPS, 2 mM MUS, GST–PSGL-1, 17 mU phenol sulfotransferase,
and DmTPST (10 μg) in 100 μL solution. TPST catalyzed
the tyrosine sulfation of GST–PSGL-1 and yielded the same amount
of PAP simultaneously. Phenol sulfotransferase immediately transferred
the sulfuryl group of MUS to PAP by tyrosine sulfation and yielded
PAPS and MU. The total amount of tyrosine sulfation can be calculated
using the fluorescent signal of MU (excitation: 360 nm; emission peak:
450 nm).17

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assay-Based Detection on Sulfated
Proteins
The TPST substrate GST–PSGL-1 was coated
on a 96-well microtiter plate [DNA-BIND (N-oxysuccinimide)
modified surface] in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer overnight.
The wells were subsequently blocked with 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature
and washed three times with PBS plus Tween-20 [PBST:PBS (pH 7.4) containing
0.05% Tween-20]. PTS on the immobilized protein was catalyzed by the
PAPSS–TPST or phenol sulfotransferase–TPST system, followed
by PBST wash three times. A primary antibody (anti-sulfotyrosine IgG
antibody, 1:1000 dilution) was then added and incubated at room temperature
for 1 h. Next, an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG
antibody, 1:6000 dilution) was added, and the mixture was incubated
for 30 min at room temperature after washing three times with PBST.
HRP reaction was developed with 100 μL TMB and stopped with
100 μL of 2 M H2SO4. Finally, the sulfated
protein was determined at OD450nm.

Western Blotting
Total proteins were separated through
12% reduced SDS–PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane by using a general western transfer protocol (Bio-Rad,
USA). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in tris-buffered
saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The sulfated proteins were
probed with anti-sulfotyrosine IgG antibody (1:1000 dilution) in TBS
with Tween-20 (TBST) overnight at 4 °C. Furthermore, this membrane
was washed five times with TBST for 5 min and then immersed in TBST
with 5% milk and anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:10 000 dilution) for 1
h at room temperature. The blot was visualized by chemiluminescence
produced by HRP catalysis for 1–30 min. For examining the effects
of time on PAPSS–TPST system catalysis, a standard assay with
various reaction times (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min)
was conducted, followed by western blotting, to monitor the PTS content.
