The monoterpene thymol has been proposed as a valuable alternative
to in-feed antibiotics in animal production. However, the effectiveness
of the antimicrobial is comprised by its fast absorption in the upper
gastrointestinal tract. In this work, two glucoconjugates, thymol
α-d-glucopyranoside (TαG) and thymol β-d-glucopyranoside (TβG), were compared with free thymol
for their potential to deliver higher concentrations of the active
compound to the distal small intestine of supplemented piglets. Additionally,
an analytical method was developed and validated for the simultaneous
quantification of thymol and its glucoconjugates in different matrices.
In stomach contents of pigs fed with 3333 μmol kg–1 thymol, TαG, or TβG, total thymol concentrations amounted
to 3048, 2357, and 1820 μmol kg–1 dry matter,
respectively. In glucoconjugate-fed pigs, over 30% of this concentration
was present in the unconjugated form, suggesting partial hydrolysis
in the stomach. No quantifiable levels of thymol or glucoconjugates
were detected in the small intestine or cecum for any treatment, indicating
that conjugation with one glucose unit did not sufficiently protect
thymol from early absorption.

==== Body
Introduction
Thymol (2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol, Figure 1) is the main monoterpene component of the
essential oil derived from Thymus species. The phenolic
compound exhibits strong antimicrobial and antioxidant properties.1 Therefore, it has been used in human medicine
and the food industry for centuries.2 More
recently, phytochemicals received increasing interest for their application
in animal nutrition due to the need for a reduction in the use of
antibiotics. Thymol has been suggested as a valuable alternative for
these in-feed antibiotics, especially for weaned piglets as weaning
is a stressful event often associated with dysbiosis of gut microbiota
and proliferation of pathogens, such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, particularly in the distal small
intestine.3 Although the bactericidal capacity
of thymol has been extensively demonstrated in vitro,1,4−6 its application in animal feeds
has several limitations. Next to its volatility and pungent taste
at high concentrations, the main restriction is the fast and complete
absorption of thymol in the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT), resulting
in insignificant concentrations at the level of the lower GIT, which
are insufficient for the desired antibacterial effects.7,8 Hence, protection of the molecule is opportune to obtain effective
luminal concentrations in the distal section of the small intestine.

Encapsulation is a popular measure to increase the stability and
functional performance of essential oils. A wide array of matrices
(e.g., whey proteins, triglycerides, and maltodextrins) and techniques
(e.g., spray drying and extrusion) are available, each with their
advantages and drawbacks.9,10 However, the existing
encapsulations of essential oils are primarily designed for food and
pharmaceutical applications.9 Many of the
encapsulated feed additives are still in the laboratory stage,10 and only few formulations have been validated
in pigs, with variable success in enhancing intestinal release.11−13 Moreover, application of this approach for animal nutrition is limited
by cost considerations.14

Glycosylation is an alternative protective method that has been
used for various pharmaceuticals in the past, thus creating prodrugs.15 It also reduces the volatility of the aglycon16 and masks the pungent taste of thymol,17 which is advantageous for application in animal
feeds. Enzymatic glycosylation uses cheap resources (e.g., sucrose)
and offers the possibility to synthesize an array of glycoconjugates
with various sugar moieties in the form of mono-, di-, or polyglycosides18 Moreover, a large variety of plant secondary
metabolites naturally occur as glycosides, increasing their water
solubility and altering their biological activity.19 The functionality of these glycoside prodrugs depends on
the release of the active aglycon at the target site by cleavage of
the glycosidic bond by glycoside-hydrolyzing enzymes. These glycosidases
are present in the GIT of mammals and are either of endogenous or
bacterial origin.15

To date, only one glycoside of thymol, namely, thymol β-d-glucopyranoside (TβG), has been investigated as a protected
form of thymol in animal nutrition. Petrujkic et al.20 compared the absorption of thymol and TβG in everted
jejunal segments of the pig and concluded that the glucoconjugate
was 2.3 and 2.8 times more resistant to absorption than pure thymol
from 1 and 3 mmol L–1 solutions, respectively. Furthermore,
oral administration of TβG resulted in significant reduction
of the Campylobacter level in the crop of market-aged
broilers, whereas pure thymol did not, as compared to a negative control.21 However, TβG has not been evaluated in vivo as a feed additive in pigs.

This work focuses on thymol α-d-glucopyranoside
(TαG), the anomer of TβG (Figure 1), which has, to the best of our knowledge,
not yet been investigated for its potential to deliver thymol to the
distal small intestine. It is hereby assumed that there is sufficient
glycosidase activity present for gradual release of the active aglycon
thymol along the GIT. First, an analytical method was developed and
validated for the simultaneous quantification of thymol and TαG
in different matrices. Thereafter, an in vivo feeding
trial was conducted to test and compare the retention of TαG
along the GIT of piglets with that of free thymol and its anomer TβG.

Results
Method Validation for the Analysis of Thymol and TαG
Selectivity
The method is considered selective as no
interfering peaks originating from the matrix could be identified
at the retention times of the peaks of interest, being 10.2, 17.2,
22.0, and 23.9 min for pNPG, TαG, iPP, and thymol, respectively.

Linearity
The calibration curves, expressed as the
ratio of the peak areas of the analyte and its respective internal
standard versus concentration, were found to be linear for both thymol
and TαG over the concentration range of 5–1200 mg kg–1 for all matrices tested. Regression equations and
determination coefficients (R2) are displayed
in Table 1.

Accuracy, Precision, and Recovery
The values for the
validation parameters accuracy, precision, and recovery are listed
in Table 2. The method
can be considered accurate and precise. The accuracy ranged from 84.7
to 107.6% and 87.6 to 108.2% for thymol and TαG, respectively,
at three concentrations in four different matrices. Recoveries were
in the range of 95 to 118% for thymol and 95 to 122% for TαG.
The highest values were found in feed at a dose of 100 mg kg–1, indicating possible overestimation of the analyte concentrations
in feed. This should, however, not pose a problem in the current study
as concentrations added to the feed of the in vivo trial were 5 to 10 times higher.

Sensitivity
The LOD and LOQ are key parameters in method
validation as they determine the lowest concentration of the analyte,
which can be reliably distinguished from the baseline or quantitated,
respectively. The values for LOD and LOQ are presented in Table 1.

Based on the
obtained validation parameters presented above, the method is considered
satisfactory for its application on in vivo samples.

Concentrations of Thymol and Its Glucosides in the GIT In Vivo
To study the retention of thymol and its
two glucosides in the lumen of the GIT of pigs, animals were fed with
these compounds for 1 day in discrete meals every 2 h. All piglets
consumed the total amount of feed offered on the day of sampling.
The additive concentrations in the feed (expressed on fresh matter
basis) were analytically checked and found to differ slightly from
the intended dose (3333 μmol kg–1). The detected
values were 3603 μmol thymol kg–1 for CON,
2790 μmol TαG kg–1 plus 149 μmol
free thymol kg–1 for αGLUC, and 3369 μmol
TβG kg–1 for βGLUC. This corresponds
to a total thymol dose of 108, 88, and 101 μmol kg BW–1 for the respective treatments. Further calculations were based on
the analytically verified concentrations in the feed and expressed
on DM basis to be able to compare across compartments.

The detected
concentrations of thymol, TαG, and TβG in gastric contents
of piglets 1 to 2 h post prandial condition are presented in Table 3. Piglets orally supplemented
with pure thymol (CON) retained concentration levels in their stomach
that were, on average, 75.3% of the concentration present in the feed
(p < 0.001; Figure 2). When piglets were fed with the monoglucosides TαG
or TβG, the total thymol concentrations (sum of free and glucoconjugated
thymol) in stomach contents were respectively 71.4% (p < 0.001) and 48.1% (p = 0.001) of the original
feed levels. Additionally, the total thymol concentration at the level
of the stomach was significantly lower in βGLUC (1820 μmol
kg–1 DM) as compared to CON piglets (3048 μmol
kg–1 DM; p = 0.002), with αGLUC
piglets showing intermediate levels (2357 μmol kg–1 DM). The proportion of the intact glucosides in the total thymol
concentrations were 66 and 63% for the αGLUC or βGLUC
treatment, respectively, while the remaining part was present as free
thymol. This finding implicates that the glucosides are partially
hydrolyzed in the stomach before absorption. Additionally, there was
a trend (p = 0.069) for lower intact glucoside concentrations
in the stomach of βGLUC pigs (1149 μmol kg–1 DM) compared to αGLUC pigs (1556 μmol kg–1 DM).

Discussion
To evaluate the retention of thymol and TαG from the GIT
of piglets, it was essential to develop a reliable method to extract
these compounds from and quantify them in feed and digesta of different
gastrointestinal sites. With one exception,22 most published methods for the analysis of thymol conjugates7,20,23 involve a first step of enzymatic
hydrolysis. The amount of conjugates is then indirectly calculated
from the difference in thymol concentration before and after hydrolysis.
The accuracy of indirect methods is highly dependent on the selectivity
and progression of the enzymatic reactions.24 The method proposed in this study avoids indirect hydrolysis and
proved to fulfill all set requirements for validation. The sensitivity
was judged to be sufficiently high for quantification of the analytes
in digesta of this particular in vivo trial. If no
absorption would occur, then the dietary levels are diluted 4 times
in gastric contents (mean DM content of 25%) and 10 times in small
intestinal contents (mean DM content of 10%). Taking into account
the administered doses of thymol (500 mg kg–1) and
TαG (1040 mg kg–1), the expected maximal concentrations
amount approximately 125 and 260 mg kg–1 in stomach
and 50 and 104 mg kg–1 in small intestine for thymol
and TαG, respectively. These values are all above the LOQ. However,
it should be mentioned that, when applying lower doses, the sensitivity
of this method might be insufficient. In this case, the remaining
concentrations in the GIT are also below the range of minimum inhibitory
concentrations against several pathogens1 and thus functionally not relevant for our purpose.

The major drawback for the use of thymol as an antimicrobial compound
in live animals is its fast clearance from the upper GIT. Therefore,
the luminal concentrations in the distal small intestine remain below
the bactericidal thresholds.7,8 The lower thymol concentrations
retrieved from the stomach contents of thymol-fed piglets as compared
to the feed and the absence of quantifiable amounts in digesta from
the small intestine in this study confirm these findings. Glucoconjugation
of the monoterpene has been tested here as a way to deliver higher
concentration to the lower gut region. Glucosides are more hydrophilic
and have a larger molecular size, which makes them more resistant
to penetration of epithelial membranes.25 Moreover, the pungent taste of the aglycon is masked and its volatility
reduced by this glucoconjugation. However, it was shown by Epps et
al.26 and Levent et al.27 that TβG has no antimicrobial activity and that its
ability to reduce bacterial populations depends on the presence of
glucoside-hydrolyzing enzymes to release the active aglycon. The abundance
of glucosidase enzymes in the proximal GIT is thought to be rather
low. On the contrary, the high level of glucosidase activity in the
distal GIT should release the active aglycon at the target sites.15,28 In the current study, however, the total thymol concentration remaining
in the stomach of piglets fed with TαG or TβG was significantly
lower than that in the feed, indicating that some absorption already
took place under the assumption that thymol as such is not broken
down by microbiota in the foregut.7 Moreover,
feeding TβG resulted in total thymol concentrations in the stomach
that were 40% lower than in the thymol treatment. Supplementing TαG
gave intermediate total stomach concentrations. Hence, feeding glucoconjugates
of thymol did not result in higher luminal thymol concentrations in
the stomach as compared to supplementation of free thymol. On the
contrary, the β-glucoside form seemed to disappear faster from
the chyme than its aglycon. This is in agreement with the study of
Cermak et al.,29 who administered an equimolar
dose of quercetin or its β-glucoside isoquercitrin to pigs and
registered a 50% increase in bioavailability from the glucoside as
compared to the aglycon. Moreover, for both quercetin and isoquercitrin,
the main metabolite appeared in the blood circulation within 1 h after
administration, but the peak of the latter was higher. This indicated
that isoquercitrin was absorbed faster, but still from the same site,
namely, the upper GIT.29 Actually, intact
absorption at the level of the stomach has been suggested for some
glucoconjugated anthocyanidins without prior hydrolysis,30,31 although this was not the case for the flavonoid glucosides of quercetin32 and daidzein.33 Therefore,
it remains to be elucidated whether absorption of glucoconjugated
thymol through the gastric wall contributes to the reduced total thymol
concentration as compared to aglycon supplementation. In any case,
the observed thymol glucoconjugate clearance from the upper GI tract
does not favor the antimicrobial action in the hindgut, yet it might
promote the systemic antioxidant34 or anti-inflammatory
activity.35

In the stomach contents of αGLUC and βGLUC piglets,
more than 30% of the total thymol was present in the free form, suggesting
that hydrolysis of both TαG and TβG took place in the
stomach. Additionally, the intact TαG concentration in stomach
tended to be higher as compared to TβG (p <
0.10), despite the slightly lower TαG concentration in feed.
This implies that the α-bound conjugates might be more resistant
to hydrolysis and absorption than the β-bound ones. Early glucoside
hydrolysis was also suggested by Epps et al.,21 who found reduced counts of Campylobacter in the
crop of broilers fed with TβG. As mentioned before, intact TβG
has no antimicrobial activity, so hydrolysis and release of the biologically
active aglycon must have occurred in the crop. By contrast, Crespy
et al.32 measured virtually unaltered concentrations
of isoquercitrin in the rat stomach 30 min after gastric administration,
while 38% of the administered aglycon, quercetin, was absorbed. The
authors concluded that the stomach does not play a crucial role in
absorption nor hydrolysis of glucosides. Important differences of
this rat study with our study might be the absence of feed in the
stomach and the lack of contact between the compounds and saliva as
the compounds were administered intragastrically. Indeed, Walle et
al.36 demonstrated the hydrolysis of quercetin,
phloretin, and genistein glucosides by human saliva. It is rather
implausible that these monoglucosides were hydrolyzed by salivary
α-amylases as these enzymes are endosaccharidases that have
no effect on terminal glucose molecules,37 although the required glucosidase activity most likely originated
from bacteria and shed epithelial cells present in the oral cavity.36 Otherwise, gastric bacteria might also contribute
to glucoside hydrolysis. Unlike humans, piglets harbor relatively
large numbers of bacteria in their stomach, among which are Lactobacilli and Enterococci, who are known
to exhibit glucosidase activities.38−40 Hydrolysis due to the
low pH in the stomach does not probably add to the appearance of the
aglycon as the temperature requirements for significant acid hydrolysis
are much higher than physiological temperatures.41,42 Deconjugation of the glucosides in the feed, prior to ingestion,
might also be suggested as the presence of glucosidase activity has
been shown in many plants commonly used as feed ingredients such as
maize, soybean, and wheat.43 The occurrence
of free thymol in the current study is not likely attributable to
in-feed hydrolysis because the compounds were mixed in the feed only
1 day prior to feeding. The minor fraction of free thymol that was
present in the αGLUC feed originates from an impurity of the
TαG product. Hence, the occurrence of free aglycon levels in
the stomach contents is thought to originate mainly from bacterial
activity in both saliva and stomach, although further research is
warranted to confirm this hypothesis and to elucidate why the β-glucoside
tends to be more easily hydrolyzed than its α-isomer.

As expected, free thymol levels in the small intestine and cecum
were very low, even below the quantification limit, irrespective of
the treatment. This is largely in accordance with the findings of
Michiels et al.,7 although
they still retrieved a minor fraction of the ingested essential oils
in SI1. This difference might be explained by the way of administration:
a single dose versus spread in meals in our study and by the application
of another extraction and analysis method. Surprising was the inability
to detect any glucosides in digesta of αGLUC and βGLUC
piglets as of SI1 in our study. Similar results were obtained by feeding
black raspberry powder, containing cyanidin-3-glucoside among other
glycosides to weaner pigs. Four hours after the meal, the monoglucoside
almost completely disappeared from small intestinal contents, and
only 2% of the total intake was recovered in cecum and colon.44 We assume that the amount of monoglucosides
remaining in the chyme must be absorbed almost instantaneously in
the duodenum upon gastric emptying, as is the case for thymol. Although,
to date, no studies are available that deal with the absorption route
of thymol glucosides, much research has been done on quercetin glucosides.
With regard to the absorption of monoglucosides across the intestinal
membrane, two hypotheses exist. First, glucosides might be hydrolyzed
by small intestinal glucosidases, such as the membrane-bound lactase
phlorizin hydrolase, before trans-epithelial absorption of the aglycon
by passive diffusion occurs.45,46 Second, there might
be carrier-mediated uptake of the monoglucoside as such by the sodium-dependent
glucose transporter-1.47 Moreover, the
bioavailability and the rate of small intestinal absorption of quercetin
were demonstrated to be highly dependent on the glycoside moiety to
which it is conjugated. Indeed, glucose conjugates were rapidly absorbed,
while other glycosides, such as galactose, rhamnose, and glucorhamnose,
were more resistant to intestinal hydrolysis and absorption.29,48 Hence, it could be of interest to synthesize and investigate the
potential of thymol conjugates with glycons other than glucose or
with more than one sugar unit to obtain delayed absorption of the
aglycon.

In conclusion, we observed that glucoconjugation did not protect
thymol from early absorption in the proximal GIT of piglets. Supplementation
of TβG even seemed to increase the absorption rate in the stomach
as compared to the aglycon, as appeared from the 40% lower total thymol
concentrations in the chyme. Importantly, it was shown that both thymol
glucosides are subject to partial hydrolysis in the stomach, yet TαG
seemed more resistant than TβG. Although the contribution of
bacteria from the oral cavity and stomach is plausible, the mechanisms
of glucoside hydrolysis in the stomach need further investigation.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Thymol (99.5% purity) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Bornem, Belgium). Thymol α-d-glucopyranoside (97%
purity, 0.8% free thymol) was enzymatically synthesized according
to the procedure described by De Winter et al.18 from a reaction mixture containing thymol (5 g L–1) and sucrose (1 mol L–1) and facilitated by the
R134A mutant of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum sucrose phosphorylase (4 U mL–1). Thymol β-d-glucopyranoside (99.4% purity) was purchased from Glentham
Life Sciences Ltd. (Corsham, U.K.). The internal standards 2-isopropylphenol
(≥98% purity) and 4-nitrophenyl α-d-glucopyranoside
(99.8% purity) were purchased from Fluka (Bornem, Belgium) and Carbosynth
Ltd. (Berkshire, U.K.), respectively. All organic solvents were of
HPLC grade and water was of Milli-Q quality (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt,
Germany).

Standard Solutions and Calibration Curves
Thymol and
TαG were accurately weighed in the same tube and subsequently
dissolved in ethanol to obtain a stock solution containing 24 g L–1 of both analytes. The standard solutions were made
by further diluting the stock solution with the appropriate amounts
of ethanol. A separate calibration curve was constructed for following
matrices: feed and digesta from stomach, small intestine, and cecum.
The calibration curves were obtained by adding the standard solutions
to blank samples, resulting in final thymol and TαG concentrations
of 5, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, and 1200 mg kg–1. The blank samples from gastric, small intestinal, and cecal digesta
for matrix-matched calibration curves and the assessment of validation
parameters were pooled samples obtained from pigs fed with a diet
free from any thymol compounds. Two internal standard solutions were
prepared: 2-isopropylphenol (iPP; 25 g L–1) for
thymol7 and 4-nitrophenyl α-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG; 0.5 g L–1) for TαG.

Sample Preparation
All samples were extracted and analyzed
in triplicate, unless stated otherwise. Samples were acidified to
pH < 2 with 2% 6 mol L–1 H2SO4 solution to prevent fermentation before adding the test compounds
(validation procedure) or at sample collection (in vivo trial). The liquid–liquid extraction procedure was adapted
from Gallo et al.49 One gram of sample
was weighed in a 15 mL glass vial with a screw cap with septum. Next,
each sample was spiked with 50 μL of iPP and pNPG internal standards.
Thereafter, 2 mL of the extraction solvent consisting of ethyl acetate,
1-butanol, and 1-propanol (60:30:10, v/v/v) was added. The samples
were first vigorously mixed on a vortex apparatus for 30 s and then
shaken horizontally on an orbital shaker (300 rpm) for 1 h, followed
by centrifugation (2000g, 10 min) and transfer of
the organic top layer. The extraction procedure was repeated a second
time following 30 min shaking. Subsequently, the organic phase was
evaporated to dryness under nitrogen gas at 40 °C. The dry residue
was reconstituted in 1 mL of a mixture of water and acetonitrile (65:35,
v/v) and filtered with a cellulose syringe filter (0.2 μm).
Aliquots of 20 μL were injected in the HPLC system upon analysis.

Chromatographic Condition
Liquid chromatography was
performed on an Agilent Technologies 1200 series LC system. Chromatographic
separation was acquired on a reversed-phase C18 column (Supelcosil
LC-18, 5 μm, 25 cm × 4.6 mm i.d.) maintained at 35 °C
and protected by a Supelguard cartridge (Supelcosil LC-18, 5 μm,
2 cm × 4 mm i.d.). Mobile phases consisted of water (solvent
A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), both with 1 mL L–1 formic acid. The elution gradient was set as follows [time in minutes
(% B)]: 0 (5), 5 (5), 25 (60), and 30 (100), with a flow rate of 2
mL min–1. Thymol, TαG, and TβG were
detected at the wavelength of 280 nm.

Method Validation
The method was validated according
to the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) Guideline for
the Validation of Analytical Procedures. For each biological matrix
(feed, gastric, small intestinal, and cecal contents), the following
validation parameters were evaluated: selectivity, linearity, precision
and accuracy, recovery, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification
(LOQ). Because of budget constraints, the method was only validated
for thymol and TαG, not for TβG.

Selectivity
Selectivity was evaluated by comparing
chromatograms of nine blank samples of each matrix with corresponding
spiked samples and testing for peak interferences.

Linearity
For the linearity study, blank samples were
spiked simultaneously with thymol and TαG, as described in the
previous section (standard solution and calibration curves). The calibration
curves consisted of blank samples and eight concentration levels ranging
from 5 to 1200 mg kg–1 of both analytes. This range
was chosen based on the expected concentrations in the samples of
the current in vivo experiment. The dependent variable
in the linear regression analysis was calculated as the ratio of peak
area of the analyte/peak area of its respective internal standard.
Linearity was evaluated using linear regression analysis calculated
with the least-squares method.

Accuracy, Precision, and Recovery
Accuracy, within-
and between-day precision, and recovery were determined by analyzing
spiked samples at three different concentrations: low (50 mg kg–1), medium (100 mg kg–1), and high
(500 mg kg–1). The analysis was performed in triplicate
and on three consecutive days by the same analyst (interday precision)
for every matrix. Accuracy was calculated as the ratio between the
mean measured concentration and the nominal concentration multiplied
by 100, while precision was expressed as the relative standard deviation
(RSD) of the measured concentrations. Concentrations were calculated
from the obtained peak areas using the previously mentioned calibration
curves. Recovery was determined by comparing the response of the samples
spiked before extraction with the response from blank samples that
were spiked after extraction and drying. The response is defined as
the ratio between the peak areas of the analyte and the respective
internal standard.

Sensitivity
Sensitivity is determined by the LOD and
LOQ. For this purpose, a separate eight-point calibration curve was
constructed in the lower concentration regions (1–25 mg kg–1) for each matrix. LOD and LOQ were calculated as
the ratio of the RSD of the regression line and the slope of the calibration
curve multiplied by 3.3 and 10, respectively.

In Vivo Absorption of Thymol and Its Glucosides
Animal Housing and Treatments
The study was conducted
in accordance with the ethical standards and recommendations for accommodation
and care of laboratory animals covered by the European Directive 2010/63/EU
on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and the
Belgian royal decree KB29.05.13 on the use of animals for experimental
studies.

Eighteen female piglets (Topigs × Piétrain)
with a mean body weight (BW) of 24.0 ± 0.6 kg were selected from
a herd and housed per two in a pen with full slated floors. The stable
had a conventional ventilation scheme, ambient temperature at 24 °C,
and a 18 light/6 dark schedule. The animals were allocated to treatments
(n = 6) with stratification for BW. Subsequently,
the pens were assigned to the treatments according to a randomized
block design. Piglets were adapted to meal feeding for 7 days during
which they received an appropriate basal diet for growing piglets
(Table 4), provided
in eight equal meals per day between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. This approach
was used to mimic steady-state conditions in the GIT. The total daily
feed intake was restricted to 40 g kg–1 BW (equivalent
to approximately 90% of the ad libitum feed intake). Animals were
allowed to eat for 30 min per meal, after which the residual feed
was collected and weighed. From day 6 onward, all animals consumed
the total amount of feed provided. Water was available ad libitum
during the whole experiment. On the day of sampling (day 8), animals
received six meals of their respective experimental diets with a 2
h interval and were finally euthanized between 1 and 2 h after their
last meal. Experimental diets consisted of the basal diet supplemented
with 3333 μmol kg–1 thymol (equivalent to
500 mg kg–1; CON treatment), an equimolar amount
of thymol-α-d-glucopyranoside (1040 mg kg–1; αGLUC treatment), or thymol-β-d-glucopyranoside
(1040 mg kg–1; βGLUC treatment).

Sample Collection and Analysis
Animals were first brought
to electronarcosis followed by exsanguination. The entire GIT was
removed, exposed, and partitioned in five digesta sampling sites:
stomach, three parts of the small intestine (SI1, SI2, and SI3 corresponding
to segments of 0–25%, 25–75%, and 75–100% of
the total length, respectively), and cecum. The contents of each compartment
were quantitatively collected. An aliquot of the fresh digesta was
acidified to pH < 2 with 2% 6 mol L–1 H2SO4 and stored at −20 °C. These samples were
further processed as described earlier for determination of the concentration
of thymol and its glucosides. The remaining intestinal contents were
frozen and freeze-dried to determine dry matter (DM) contents. Feed
samples were collected to verify the concentrations of the analytes.

Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed with
SPSS Statistics 24.0 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Assumptions
of normality and equality of variances were checked using the Shapiro–Wilkinson
and Levene tests, respectively. Results were analyzed using t-tests and ANOVA procedures on the 5% significance level.
