A novel dual-response
fluorescent sensor based on a diarylethene
photoswitching unit and a dansylhydrazine functional group has been
synthesized. The compound exhibited high selectivity for Fe3+ and Cu2+ with independent fluorescence signal outputs.
In the presence of Fe3+, the sensor formed a 1:1 metal
complex, resulting in a remarkable “turn-off” fluorescence
signal. On the other hand, its fluorescence intensity was notably
enhanced (turn-on) and a color change from bright yellow to bright
blue was observed when the sensor interacted with Cu2+,
which was due to the hydrolysis reaction of the dansyl acid dye, as
confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry–electrospray
ionization and infrared spectrum. The detection limits were 9.73 ×
10–8 mol L–1 for Fe3+ and 3.49 × 10–7 mol L–1 for Cu2+, respectively. From the unimolecular platform,
two molecular logic circuits were constructed using the fluorescence
emission intensity at 557/494 nm (Fe3+/Cu2+)
as the outputs and the combined stimuli of Fe3+/ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid, Cu2+, and UV/vis as the inputs. In addition, the
sensor was successfully used to determine Fe3+ in water
samples from Ganjiang River and soil samples from Nanchang fields.

Introduction
Fluorescent chemosensor
molecules can change their fluorescence
properties upon substrate binding or metal-induced reaction. This
behavior provides an extremely sensitive optical approach for real-time
monitoring of molecular interactions. These fluorescent molecules
have been used as sensors in many fields such as biology, medical
analysis, and environmental monitoring.1 Recently, it has been reported that dual-stimuli-responsive small-molecule
organic fluorescence chemosensors displayed evidently fluorescence
quenching or enhancement upon excitation with multi-metal ions, photostimuli,
and induced reaction. These chemosensors have attracted a great deal
of attention because of their potential applications in optical devices,
controlled release, erasable memory media, optical switching, molecular
fluorescence probe, etc.2−7 Diarylethene derivatives were the most promising candidates as fluorescent
switch units because of their fast response, excellent thermal stability,
and outstanding fatigue resistance.8 During
the past decade, numerous efforts had been devoted to designing and
synthesizing diarylethene derivatives containing fluorophore groups
with strong fluorescence, such as coumarin, naphthalimide, phenanthroline,
bipyridyl, rhodamine B moieties, and so on.9−13 These functional diarylethene fluorescent probes
could be applied to detect and analyze special metal ions such as
Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Fe3+, and Al3+ with high
selectivity and sensitivity.

As one of the most essential trace
elements, Fe3+ ions
play critical roles in numerous physiological and pathological processes,
such as oxygen metabolism, enzymatic catalysis, oxygen uptake, electron
transfer, and regulation of body temperature.14,15 However, the imbalance of the Fe3+ ion within the body
could cause several diseases including various cancers, heart failure,
hepatitis diabetes, and Parkinson’s disease.16,17 Additionally, as an essential trace element in the human body, Cu2+ plays a crucial role in cellular oxygen transportation/activation,
energy generation, and signal transduction.18,19 However, excessive or deficient intake of Cu2+ is harmful
to human health and results in serious neurodegenerative diseases
including Menkes syndrome, Wilson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s.20−22 Moreover, Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions are considered
as important water pollution and toxic species because of their widespread
application in industry and in our daily life. According to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports, the upper limits of
Cu2+ and Fe3+ in drinking water or food were
1.3 ppm (∼20 μM) and 0.3 ppm (∼5.4 μM),
respectively.23,24 Therefore, it is crucial to detect
Cu2+ and Fe3+ in various biological and environmental
systems.

As transition-metal ions, both Cu2+ and
Fe3+ are known to be paramagnetic and most of the reported
Cu2+/Fe3+ fluorescent chemosensors are “turn-off”
fluorescent probes, which are not sensitive compared to the signal
enhancement detection mode.25−27 Nevertheless, there were only
a few cases of “turn-on” fluorescent response for Cu2+ and most of them were constructed from the Cu2+-catalyzed elimination reaction of hydrazides,28,29 esters,30,31 amide,32,33 and thiosemicarbazide
group.34 Other “turn-on”
fluorescent response of Cu2+ promoted by the hydrolysis
reaction has also been reported. For example, Choi et al. reported
a chemosensor based on dansyl-Schiff for the determination of Cu2+, and its fluorescence emission wavelength showed a remarkable
blue shift by the Cu2+-promoted hydrolysis reaction.35

5-Dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonate
is a fascinating fluorophore,
in which the dimethylamino moiety represents the electron donor and
the naphthalene sulfonyl unit functions as the electron acceptor.36,37 The molecule has large Stokes shift, high fluorescence quantum yield,
intense absorption band in the near UV region, and strong fluorescence
in the visible region.38−40 These characteristics, combined with the synthesis
flexibility of the sulfonic acid group, had led the dansyl fluorophore
to be a core structure in many fluorescent sensors and labels. As
previously mentioned, Cu2+ fluorescent enhancement sensors
were rarely reported because of the paramagnetic nature of Cu2+. Particularly, a Cu2+-catalyzed hydrolysis fluorescent
enhancement based on a diarylethene containing a dansylhydrazine group
has not hitherto been reported. Herein, we designed and synthesized
a dansyl-diarylethene-based “turn-on” fluorescent probe
for Cu2+ and “turn-off” fluorescent probe
for Fe3+. This molecular probe showed high selectivity,
low detection limit, large Stokes shift, and strong fluorescence change.
The schematic illustration of photochromism is shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Photochromism of
Diarylethene 1O
Results and Discussion
Photochromism and Fluorescence of 1O
The
photochromic and fluorescence properties of 1O were studied
in methanol (C = 2.0 × 10–5 mol L–1) at room temperature. 1O showed
good photochromic properties and could be triggered between their
colored closed-ring isomers 1C and colorless open-ring
isomers 1O by alternating irradiation with UV and visible
light (λ > 500 nm). The absorption spectrum changes of 1O in methanol are shown in Figure 1A. The maximum of absorption for the open-ring
isomer 1O was found at 311 nm (ε = 3.85 ×
104 L mol–1 cm–1) because
of the π → π* transition.41,42 Upon irradiation with 297 nm UV light, two new absorption peaks
appeared at 356 nm (ε = 1.59 × 104 L mol–1 cm–1) and 556 nm (ε = 1.18
× 104 L mol–1 cm–1), and this process was accompanied by a color change from colorless
to violet. This was attributed to the photocyclization reaction from
the open-ring isomer to the closed-ring isomer. The photostationary
state (PSS) was obtained in 10 min and a clear isosbestic point was
observed at 344 nm, indicating that photoisomerization was a unimolecular
process of the two species. The violet closed-ring isomer 1C could be thoroughly decolorized to colorless and the absorption
spectra of the open-ring isomer 1O could be regenerated
as a result of the photocycloreversion reaction upon irradiation with
visible light (λ > 500 nm). The coloration–decolorization
cycles of 1O could be repeated 50 times with a negligible
degradation (Figure S1, Supporting Information). In addition, the thermal stability of the open-ring and closed-ring
isomers of 1 was tested in methanol at 338 K in the dark
for more than 7 days and no change has been observed in the UV/vis
spectra and color of 1, indicating excellent thermal
stability for diarylethene 1. The cyclization and cycloreversion
quantum yields of 1 were determined to be 0.24 and 0.29
(Table 1), respectively,
by using 1,2-bis(2-methyl-5-phenyl-3-thienyl)perfluorocyclopentene
as a reference in methanol. The photoconversion ratio was 88.2% in
the PSS (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

(C = 2.0 × 10–5 mol L–1): (A) absorption spectral and color changes and (B)
fluorescence and color changes (λex = 338 nm).

The fluorescence spectrum of 1O was measured in methanol
(C = 2.0 × 10–5 mol L–1) at room temperature. As shown in Figure 1B, 1O exhibited
a strong fluorescence emission peak at 557 nm when excited at 338
nm. The fluorescence quantum yield of 1O was determined
to be 0.045 by using an absolute PL quantum yield spectrometer QYC11347-11.
Upon irradiation with 297 nm light, the fluorescence emission intensity
of 1O was progressively quenched with a remarkable hypochromatic
blue shift to 509 nm. An obvious concomitant color change from bright
yellow to dark was observed under the excitation of 365 nm light (Figure 1B, inset), indicating
the formation of the weak fluorescence closed-ring isomer 1C. The fluorescence emission intensity of 1O was quenched
to ca. 55% in the PSS, and the fluorescence quantum yield of 1C was determined to be 0.027. The fluorescence peak at the
557 nm decreases because of the closed-ring isomer, which was produced
by the photocyclization conversion reaction. The existence of a dansylhydrazine
moiety might be responsible for the residual fluorescence in the PSS.
The back irradiation with visible light (λ > 500 nm) regenerated
the original emission intensity and restored to the emission peak
of 1O (Table 1).

Fluorescence Response to Metal Ions
The binding ability
of 1O with various metal cations (5.0 equiv for Cu2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Cr3+, Co2+, Mn2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, K+, Ca2+, Fe3+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, and Ni2+)
were investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. Figure 2 shows the emission spectra and fluorescence
color change of 1O in methanol (C =
2.0 × 10–5 mol L–1). As shown
in Figure 2A, none
of these metal ions induced any significant changes in the fluorescence
spectrum of 1O except Fe3+ and Cu2+. When Cu2+ was added to the solution of 1O, the fluorescence emission intensity was enhanced sharply and the
emission peak hypsochromic-shifted from 557 to 494 nm with a concomitant
color change from bright yellow to bright blue. In contrast, the fluorescence
intensity of 1O remarkably decreased with a negligible
emission peak change and a color change from bright yellow to dark
when Fe3+ was applied to the solution. Consequently, diarylethene 1O could be used as a bifunctional selective fluorescence
sensor for Cu2+ (turn-on) and Fe3+ (turn-off)
over other competing metal ions in methanol. To estimate the specificity
of 1O, competitive experiments were performed by adding
Cu2+/Fe3+ (5.0 equiv) to the solution of 1O in the presence of other metal ions (5.0 equiv). As shown
in Figure S3 (Supporting Information),
it is clear that no obvious interference in the fluorescence was observed
when Cu2+ was added to the solutions containing 1O and the same amount of other competitive metal ions even the paramagnetic
quencher Fe3+. Additionally, there were no evident variations
in the fluorescence intensity as other competitive metal ions were
added to the mixed solutions containing 1O and Fe3+. The results indicated that other competitive metal ions
had no obvious impact on the fluorescence of 1O. This
reveals that diarylethene 1O would be a highly effective
bifunctional fluorescent probe for the detection of Cu2+ and Fe3+ over other common metal ions.

of 1O induced by the addition
of various metal ions (3.0 equiv) in methanol (C =
2.0 × 10–5 mol L–1): (A)
emission spectral changes and (B) photos demonstrating changes in
its fluorescence.

To further evaluate the
affinities between 1O and
Fe3+/Cu2+, a series of tests including fluorescence
titration analysis, Job’s plot, and mass spectrometry (MS)
were performed in this study. The results of the fluorescence changes
by titrating Fe3+ and Cu2+ into the solution
of 1O are shown in Figure 3. Upon addition of Fe3+ (0 → 3.0
equiv Figure 3A), the
original fluorescence emission intensity at 557 nm dramatically decreased
and remained almost unchanged with further titration. Compared to 1O, the emission intensity was quenched to ca. 23% owing to
the formation of a complex 1O–Fe3+.
The absolute fluorescence quantum yield was determined to be 0.005.
This fluorescence decay phenomenon may be ascribed to strong chelation-enhanced
fluorescence quenching (CHEQ).43 It should
be noted that the fluorescence of 1O could be reversibly
restored by adding excess ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to
the complex 1O–Fe3+. This was due to
the complexation–dissociation reaction between Fe3+ and EDTA. Similarly, the closed-ring isomer of 1C showed
“turn-off” fluorescent response to Fe3+.
When 3.0 equiv of Fe3+ was added to the solution of 1O in PSS, the emission peak was red-shifted by 30 nm with
fluorescence emission intensity reduction to ca. 10% in comparison
with 1O. This was due to the formation of a complex 1C–Fe3+ (Figure S4A, Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Changes in the fluorescence spectrum of
chemosensor 1 induced by Fe3+/EDTA and Cu2+ in methanol
(2.0 × 10–5 mol L–1): (A) 1O induced by Fe3+/EDTA (Inset: the fluorescence
intensity curve at 557 nm with the addition of different equiv Fe3+) and (B) 1O induced by Cu2+ with
sufficient response time (Inset: the fluorescence intensity curve
at 494 nm with the addition of different equiv Cu2+).

In contrast, increased Cu2+ concentrations (0 →
4.0 equiv Figure 3B)
resulted in a sharp fluorescence enhancement up to 5.5-fold around
494 nm with the notable fluorescent color change from bright yellow
to bright blue. The absolute fluorescence quantum yield of 1O + Cu2+ was determined to be 0.085 using the absolute
PL quantum yield spectrometer QYC11347-11. Similarly, the closed-ring
isomer of 1C also showed “turn-on” fluorescent
response to Cu2+. Moreover, by plotting the fluorescence
intensity ratio at 557/494 and 557 nm (I557nm/I557nm for Fe3+ and I494nm/I557nm for
Cu2+) as a function of Fe3+/Cu2+ concentrations,
respectively, a good linear relationship between the ratio of the
fluorescence intensities and the concentrations of Fe3+/Cu2+ (0 → 2.0 equiv) was obtained as shown in
the inset of Figure 3. The results demonstrated that 1O could quantitatively
detect Fe3+/Cu2+ at relevant concentrations.
Subsequently, the fluorescence switch properties of the complex 1O–Fe3+ and 1O + Cu2+ were performed upon irradiation with UV/vis light. The results showed
that the emission intensity of 1O–Fe3+ could be further quenched to ca. 48% because of the formation of
the nonfluorescence 1C–Fe3+ (Figure
S4B, Supporting Information), whereas the
emission intensity of the complex 1O + Cu2+ exhibited no significant change upon photoirradiation. Moreover,
it was also noted that diarylethene 1 showed a time-dependent
fluorescence intensity to Cu2+. Upon addition of Cu2+ (4.0 equiv), the fluorescence emission peak at 557 nm quickly
blue-shifted to 494 nm and the fluorescence intensity decreased slightly.
The fluorescence intensity of 1O gradually increased
till a certain time of 150 min and remained almost unchanged over
a period of time of 30 min (Figure 4A). Just like 1O, the weak fluorescence
of 1O in the PSS was also observed for a “turn-on”
signal by Cu2+ (4.0 equiv) stimulation with the time-dependent
fluorescence response (0 → 80 min). In comparison to the open-ring
isomer 1O, the response time of the closed-ring isomer 1C to Cu2+ was much shorter, indicating that 1C had higher sensitivity toward Cu2+ than 1O. The high energy of the closed-ring 1C may
be responsible for this phenomenon.44,45 Subsequently,
the reversibility of 1O/1C toward Cu2+ was investigated and the fluorescence spectrum of 1O/1C + Cu2+ could not be restored
to that of 1O/1C even when an excess amount
of EDTA solution had been added. This indicated that diarylethene 1O is a fluorescence irreversible probe for the detection
of Cu2+.

Figure 4 (A) 1O induced by Cu2+ with time
variation
(0 → 150 min) and (B) 1C induced by Cu2+ with time variation (0 → 80 min).

Considering the above results, the fluorescence enhancement
effect
between 1O and Cu2+ attracted more attention
than the Fe3+ quenching effect. It is suspected that the
Cu2+-catalytic hydrolysis reaction is responsible for this
phenomenon.46−49 In order to confirm the inference, the electrospray ionization (ESI)
mass spectrometry (MS) tracking experiments were carried out. As shown
in Figure 5, the peak
at m/z = 772.1164 (calcd = 772.1173)
corresponded to [1O + Na]+. When 2.0 equiv
of Cu2+ was added into the solution of 1O,
the original peak of 1O (m/z = 772.1164) disappeared and three new peaks were observed at m/z = 501.0248, 266.0492, and 250.0547.
It was believed that these new peaks are related to compound [2O – H]− (m/zcalcd = 501.0418), compound [3 + H]+ (m/zcalcd = 266.0963), and a new strongly fluorescent
dye hydrolysate 5-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (m/zcalcd = 250.0538), respectively.
These findings suggested that diarylethene 1O was hydrolyzed
upon catalysis by Cu2+. To further confirm that the Cu2+-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction occurs, the infrared (IR)
spectroscopy of 1O was conducted before and after adding
Cu2+. It is clearly observed that the vibration peaks of
the secondary amines ν(N–H) at 3308 and 2546 cm–1 almost disappeared after the Cu2+ addition, whereas two
new vibration peaks of hydroxy ν(O–H) were observed at
3334 and 2546 cm–1 (the associating vibration peak)
(Figure S5, Supporting Information). In
addition, the vibration peaks of the bond (νC–N = 1053 cm–1) distinctly decreased, while the vibration
peaks of νC–O = 1684 cm–1 were significantly enhanced. These results implied that diarylethene 1O was hydrolyzed in the presence of Cu2+. The
fluorescence quantum yield of hydrolysate was determined to be ca.
0.085 at the saturation. On the basis of the above-mentioned facts,
the hydrolysis reaction mechanism of 1O by Cu2+ was proposed as shown in Scheme 2. The limit of detection (LOD) of the probe for Cu2+ was determined to be 3.49 × 10–7 mol
L–1 (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The result showed that probe 1 had excellent
sensitivity for Cu2+ detection.

Scheme 2 Proposed Cu2+-Catalytic Hydrolysis Reaction
Mechanism
for 1O
The selectivity of 1O as a fluorescence sensor
for
Fe3+ was obtained through the CHEQ effect, which was different
from that of Cu2+. In order to determine the binding stoichiometry
between 1O and Fe3+, Job’s method was
used for fluorescence titration. As shown in Figure 6A, the inflection points were fixed at 0.5,
indicating a 1:1 binding stoichiometry ratio for 1O and
Fe3+. Furthermore, the formation of a 1O–Fe3+ complex was also confirmed by the ESI mass spectra. As shown
in Figure S7 (Supporting Information),
the peaks at m/z = 837.0905 (calcd
= 837.0523) corresponded to [1O + Fe3+ –
2H + 2OH–]+. The binding mechanism between 1O and Fe3+ is shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information). On the basis of these
findings, the association constant (Ka) was calculated to be 1.04 × 104 L mol–1 for 1O–Fe3+ with a good linear relationship
(R = 0.998, Figure 6B) according to the Benesi–Hildebrand equation.50,51 Subsequently, the LOD of 1O toward Fe3+ was
determined to be 9.73 × 10–8 mol L–1 by the concentration-dependent fluorescence titration experiment
(Figure 6C). Compared
to other Fe3+ sensors,52−54 the LOD of 1O was much lower, suggesting that diarylethene 1O could
serve as a good fluorescence sensor for Fe3+ with high
sensitivity and sensitivity.

Determination of Fe3+ in the Real Sample
To study
the practical application in the real sample, two real water
samples from the Ganjiang River of Nanchang City were collected. The
first sample was from upstream which was 200 m away from the city
sewage outfall and the other one was from downstream. According to
the reported methods,55,56 different amounts of Fe3+ were spiked into the real water samples. Table S1 (Supporting Information) shows the results obtained from the
probe 1O in the presence of Fe3+. A good recovery
was observed in upstream water samples, but the results showed a large
deviation in downstream water. The results indicated that the detection
limit of Fe3+ is low, indicating that 1O could
be used to detect the content of Fe3+ in the downstream
water samples. As shown in Figure 7A, a calibration curve was built within a range of
0–1.0 × 10–5 M of Fe3+ (R = 0.99352). Upon addition of 1.0 μL downstream river
water sample, the concentration of Fe3+ in the sample was
determined to be 4.09 × 10–6 M (0.22 ppm) with
three parallel experiments, which is lower than the EPA standard.
The results manifested that 1O could be served as a Fe3+ sensor for practical samples. Furthermore, solid samples
(10.0 g) were collected from the rice fields of Nanchang and made
into 30.0 mL solution sample by the wet digestion method.57−59 Then, upon addition of 1.0 μL sample, the Fe3+ concentration
of the solid samples was determined to be 2.82 × 10–2 M in the 1.0 g soil samples (Figure 7B).

point was the result of soil samples). (C) The concentration-dependent

Application in Logic Circuit
According to the above
results, the fluorescence of 1O could be modulated independently
by either light or chemical stimuli in methanol. On the basis of the
findings, a combinational logic circuit was constructed (Figure 8),60,61 in which the stimulation of light irradiation (In1: 297 nm light
and In2: λ > 500 nm visible light) and chemical species (In3:
Fe3+ and In4: EDTA) were applied as four input signals,
the changes of fluorescence intensity at 557 nm [was less than the
87% original value (turn-on)] were used as the output signal (Out1).
The output signal could be treated as “on” with a Boolean
value of “1” when strong fluorescence intensity was
larger than 55% compared with the original value, otherwise regarded
as “off” with a Boolean value of “0”.
For example, when input string values were “1, 0, 0, and 0”,
In1, In2, In3, and In4 were “on, off, off, and off”.
Upon photoirradiation with 297 light, 1O was transformed
to 1C and the fluorescence emission intensity obviously
decreased. Therefore, the output signal Out1 was “on”
and the output digit was “1”. Similarly, other stimulations
also resulted in the same “off–on–off”
fluorescence switch, and all possible logic strings of the four inputs
were concluded as a combinational logic circuit (Table 2). Similarly, another logic
circuit was constructed with the combination of three input signals
(In1: 297 nm light, In2: λ > 500 nm visible light, In5: Cu2+) and one output signal (Out2: fluorescence intensity at
494 nm) (Figure S9, Supporting Information). In this logic circuit, the output signal could serve as “on”
when the fluorescence intensity was larger than the original value,
otherwise defined as “off”. For example, when input
string values were “0, 0, and 1”, In1, In2, and In5
were “off, off, and on”. Consequently, when probe 1O was stimulated by Cu2+ and its emission intensity
at 494 nm increased significantly, the output signal (Out2) was “on”
and the output digit was “1”. All of the possible strings
of the three inputs and their corresponding outputs are listed in
Table S2 (Supporting Information).

Conclusions
In summary, a novel
dual-response diarylethene fluorescence chemosensor
for the detection of Cu2+ and Fe3+ was designed
and successfully synthesized. Our experimental results demonstrated
that diarylethene 1O was able to recognize Cu2+ and Fe3+ with remarkably different fluorescence signals
and distinct response mechanism. The quenching mechanism of Fe3+ was ascribed to the formation of a 1O–Fe3+ complex. While the corresponding fluorescence enhancement
effect of Cu2+ was studied with HRMS-ESI and IR spectra
analysis, the Cu2+-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction of 1O and the formation of a dansyl acid dye are believed to
be the root cause for the enhancement effect. On the basis of the
fact that the fluorescence of the diarylethene compound could be effectively
modulated by stimulation with light and chemical species, two combination
logic circuits were successfully designed and constructed. Furthermore,
diarylethene 1O could be utilized for Fe3+ detection in real samples. In conclusion, a new approach for designing
and constructing bifunctional fluorescence sensors had been demonstrated
in this investigation. The sensors were based on photochromic diarylethenes,
and they showed outstanding selectivity for multiple guest species
of interest as shown in this report.

General
Methods
All solvents used were of spectro-grade
and purified by distillation prior to use. Expect for K1+ and Hg2+ (their counter anions were chloride
ions), other metal ions were obtained by the dissolution of their
respective metal nitrates (0.1 mmol) in distilled water (10 mL). EDTA
was obtained by the dissolution of EDTA disodium salt (Na2EDTA) (1.0 mmol) in distilled water (10 mL).1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker AV400 (400 MHz)
spectrometer with DMSO-d6 as a solvent
and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. UV/vis spectra
were measured on an Agilent 8453 UV/vis spectrophotometer. Fluorescence
spectra were recorded with a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer.
The fluorescence quantum yield was measured with an absolute PL quantum
yield spectrometer QY C11347-11. IR spectra were collected on a Bruker
Vertex-70 spectrometer. MS analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100
ion trap MSD spectrometer. Melting point was measured using a WRS-1B
melting point apparatus. Photoirradiation experiments were performed
using an SHG-200 UV lamp, Cx-21 ultraviolet fluorescence analysis
cabinet, and a BMH-250 visible lamp. Synthesis of diarylethene 1O is shown in Scheme 3.

Synthesis of 1-(2,5-Dimethyl-3-thienyl)-2-[2-methyl-5-(dansyl-4-benzoylhydrazino)-3-thienyl]perfluorocyclopentene
(1O)
A mixture of compound 2O (0.50
g, 1 mmol) was added dropwise to isobutyl chloroformate (0.16 g, 1.2
mmol) and triethylamine (0.10 g, 1.0 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran
under stirring at 0 °C for 0.5 h. Then, compound 3 (0.32 g, 1.2 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture at 70 °C
and stirred 5 h. The reaction mixture was cooled, the solvent was
under reduced pressure, and then the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane.
The organic layer was washed with water, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated. The crude product was purified
by column chromatography using petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (3:1)
as the eluent to obtain 0.30 g of the target compound 1O as a yellow solid in 55% yield. mp 134–135 °C. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm):

Real Sample Analysis
The water sample was filtered
through a filter paper to remove some large-size impurities. The solutions
of Fe3+/Cu2+ (0.01 mol L–1) were prepared by the dissolution of Fe(NO3)3/Cu(NO3)2 in distilled water (standard solutions)
and river water (sample solutions), respectively. The intensity for
each of the four standard solutions was determined at 557/494 nm for
the fluorescence spectrum. The results were obtained, and the working
curve was prepared. The intensity of the sample solutions was determined
to find out the concentration of Fe3+/Cu2+ by
the working curve method.
