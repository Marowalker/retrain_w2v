Understanding
the role of surfactants or ligands on the growth
mechanism of metal/alloy nanoparticles (NPs) is important for controlled
synthesis of functional metallic NPs with tailored structures and
properties. There have been a number of works showing the significant
impact of surfactants/ligands on the shape-controlled synthesis of
nanocrystals with well-defined surfaces. Beyond the morphological
shape control, impact of the surfactants/ligands on the alloying structure
of bimetallic nanocrystals, however, still remains largely unaddressed.
We reveal here a significant effect of benzoic acid ligand on the
elemental growth and alloying phase structure of octahedral Pt–Ni
NPs, a class of highly active electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction
reaction in fuel cells. Contrary to previous reports showing the critical
role of benzoic acid in directing the growth of octahedral Pt–Ni
NPs, we found that benzoic acid played a minor role in forming the
octahedral shape; instead, it can strongly coordinate with Ni cation
and significantly slows down its reduction rate, leading to a phase
separation in the Pt–Ni NP products (a mixture of Pt-rich octahedral
NPs and nearly pure Ni NPs). Such phase separation further resulted
in a lower catalytic activity and stability. These results help us
comprehensively understand the effect of metal–ligand coordination
chemistry on the elemental growth mechanism and alloying phase structure
of bimetallic NPs, complementing previous emphasis on the role of
surfactants in purely morphological shape control.

Introduction
The elemental growth
kinetics of metal alloy nanoparticles (NPs)
can greatly impact their shape, composition, and thereby their phytochemical
properties. To synthesize shaped NPs with specific surface structures
and functionalities, it is usual to grow the NPs with the desire surfaces
under the protection of a certain surfactant.1 For instance, there have been intense interests in the synthesis
of octahedral PtNi alloy NPs enclosed by {111} facets, which represents
one of the state-of-the-art highly active electrocatalyst for the
cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells.2−6 Several methods have been successfully developed during past years,
including organic phase reduction using oleylamine and oleic acid
as the surfactants4,7−9 and solvothermal
synthesis in a N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) solvent with or without benzoic acid (BA) as the surfactant.3,5,10,11 Studying the effect of surfactants on the elemental growth kinetics
is critical to guide the morphology and surface compositional control
of the shaped alloy NPs.9,12−14 Although the effect of surfactants on the NP morphology/shape has
been extensively studied and more recently quantitatively analyzed
through a ligand chemistry approach,15 the
impact of surfactants on the elemental growth kinetics and alloying
phase structure of bimetallic alloy NPs has been rarely studied. This
work aims to fill this knowledge gap.

Taking the DMF-solvothermal
synthesis of octahedral Pt–Ni
NPs as a typical example, the role of BA surfactant in forming the
octahedral NPs is still in debate. Carpenter and Cui et al. showed
that the octahedral Pt–Ni NPs can be prepared by the DMF-solvothermal
reduction without any dedicated surfactants, making it an ideal method
for synthesizing octahedral Pt–Ni NPs with clean catalytic
surfaces.3,10,16 However, Huang
reported that the use of BA was critical for the growth of Pt–Ni
octahedral NPs in the DMF solvent.5,11 When BA was
replaced with phenol or benzaldehyde, only small cubes or irregular
particles formed. They concluded that it was the BA adsorbed on the
{111} facets that promoted the formation of octahedral Pt–Ni
NPs.11 Besides the unclarified role of
the BA in controlling the octahedral shape, how BA affects the alloying
structure of PtNi NPs also remains unaddressed.

Here, we reveal
the effect of BA on the elemental growth kinetics
and alloying phase structure of octahedral PtNi NPs during the DMF-solvothermal
synthesis by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) combined
with ultraviolet (UV)/visible spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR). We show that regardless the usage of BA surfactant,
PtNi octahedral NPs can be steadily synthesized by the DMF solvothermal
reduction, although BA may improve the quality of the octahedral shape.
However, it is also found that BA can significantly decrease the NP
size and more importantly slows down the reduction kinetics of Ni
precursor via forming a new Ni–(BA) complex precursor, leading
to a phase separation in the final Pt–Ni NPs. Refining previously
well-recognized shape-directing role,3,6 our results
contribute to a deeper understanding on the metal–ligand coordination
chemistry and its effect on the elemental growth mechanism and phase
separation of bimetallic alloy NPs.

Results and Discussion
We prepared Pt–Ni NPs using the DMF-solvothermal reduction
at different temperatures (120–200 °C) in the presence
and absence of BA. The as-prepared NPs were further supported on a
high-surface-area carbon support (Vulcan XC, Cabot), and their TEM
images are shown in Figure 1. In the absence of BA (Figure 1a–d, and the particle size histogram shown in Figure 1j), most of the NPs
exhibit the octahedral shape except that the NPs turn to a cuboctahedral
shape at the highest temperature (200 °C), which was ascribed
to the selective adsorption of acac ligand on the {111} facets.12 The NP size increases with the increase of reaction
temperature. The bulk compositions of the NPs were measured by inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry, showing that the Ni content
in the NPs increases with increasing temperature (from Pt62Ni38 at 120 °C to Pt30Ni70 at
200 °C). This is reasonable because the Pt ion has a more positive
reduction potential than Ni ion, and thus the Ni precursor was reduced
much slower at lower temperatures. As the temperature increases, the
reduction rate of Ni precursor increases, leading to increased Ni
content in the NPs.

without
(a–d) and with (e–h) BA at different reaction temperatures:
(a,e) 120 °C, (b,f) 140 °C, (c,g) 180 °C, and (d,h)
200 °C. (i–l) Composition and particle size distributions
of Pt–Ni NPs prepared without (i,j) and with (k,l) BA under
different temperatures measured by ICP and TEM images.

When BA was added into the reaction solution, we
obtained octahedral
Pt–Ni NPs (denoted as PtNi-BA) with much smaller NP size (about
4 nm in ledge length), as shown by the TEM images in Figure 1e–h and the particle
size histogram in Figure 1l. The quality of the octahedral shape of the Pt–Ni
NPs prepared with BA appears to be improved, confirming an auxiliary
role of BA in regulating the shaped-controlled growth in addition
to the main role of acetylacetonate ligand. The smaller particle size
also indicates a strong effect of BA in inhibiting the NP growth.
In addition, we found that the Ni content of NPs formed with BA (Figure 1k) was generally
lower than those prepared without BA (Figure 1i) at identical temperatures, although higher
temperature again resulted in higher Ni content. This indicates that
BA may slow down the reduction rate of the Ni precursor.

The
effect of BA on the alloying structure of Pt–Ni NPs
was further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure 2). In the absence of BA, all
Pt–Ni NPs show the same face-centered cubic structure, whereas
the diffraction peaks shifting to higher angles at higher synthesis
temperatures, indicating a higher alloying content of Ni in the Pt–Ni
alloy phase due to a larger contraction of lattice parameter. However,
in the presence of BA, the XRD patterns of the Pt–Ni NPs prepared
under higher temperatures show no obvious shift of the diffraction
peaks relative to the one prepared at 120 °C, even though the
Ni content also increases with increasing temperature as shown by
ICP. Instead, a separate pure Ni phase, identified by the Ni(111)
peak at 44.5°, starts to emerge at 140 °C and higher temperatures.
We therefore conclude that BA can strongly affect the elemental growth
kinetics of the octahedral Pt–Ni NPs, leading to the separated
Pt-rich NPs and nearly pure Ni NPs. The existence of a separate Ni-rich
phase in the Pt–Ni NPs prepared in the presence of BA was also
confirmed by high-angle annular-dark field scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) images (Figure S1), whereas
no pure Ni NPs were found in the synthesis without BA.

octahedral NPs prepared without and
with BA at different temperatures.

We further investigated the effect of different amounts of
BA (0,
0.25, 2.5, and 5 mmol) on the growth of octahedral Pt–Ni NPs
at 160 °C. Figure 3a–e shows that all NPs show a similar octahedral shape but
the size decreases with increasing amount of BA, indicating a strong
effect of BA in inhibiting the NP growth. The XRD result (Figure 3f) further shows
that with increasing amount of BA, the diffraction peaks shift to
lower angles, indicating decreasing alloying degree of Pt and Ni.
Again, the separate pure Ni phase identified by the Ni(111) peak at
44.5° exists on all Pt–Ni NPs synthesized with BA. Thus,
our results indicate a strong effect of BA on the elemental growth
of octahedral Pt–Ni NPs, thus leading to decreased alloying
extent of Pt–Ni and the formation of a separate pure Ni NPs.

To gain insight into the origin of the impact of BA, we conducted
UV/vis and FTIR spectroscopy of Pt(acac)2, Ni(acac)2, BA, and their mixtures in an ethanol solvent (Figure 4). Figure 4a shows that the UV/vis spectrum of a mixed
solution of BA and Pt(acac)2 is simply coincided with the
addition of the UV/vis spectrum of BA and the UV/vis spectrum of Pt(acac)2. Because the absorbance is proportional to the concentration
of the absorbent, it indicates that BA has no interaction with Pt(acac)2. In contrast, when mixing BA and Ni(acac)2 in
ethanol (Figure 4b),
both the adsorption peaks of BA (λmax = 227 nm) and
Ni(acac)2 (λmax = 295 nm) decreased, suggesting
a possible interaction between BA and Ni(acac)2.

Figure 4 UV/vis spectra
(a,b) and FTIR spectra (c,d) of mixtures of Pt(acac)2,
Ni(acac)2, and BA at room temperature. The assignment
of each adsorption band is according to refs (17) and (18). (e) Schematic of a typical
coordination of BA with Ni2+.

More information on the interaction between BA and Ni(acac)2 can be induced from the FTIR measurement (Figure 4c,d). The FTIR spectrum of
the mixed solution of BA and Pt(acac)2 again can be well
decomposed into the spectrum of pure Pt(acac)2 and the
spectrum of BA, indicating no interaction between Pt(acac)2 and BA (Figure 4c).
However, for the mixed solution of BA and Ni(acac)2 (Figure 4d), the adsorption
bands associated with the −COOH group in the BA (Figure 4d, denoted by the open marks)
weakened significantly, whereas the adsorption bands assigned to the
benzene ring (denoted by the solid marks in Figure 4c) in the BA almost kept unchanged.17 This result suggests a strong coordination of
Ni2+ with the carboxylic group rather than the benzene
ring in BA. Indeed, two new adsorption bands at 1571 and 1382 cm–1 emerged, which were assigned to the asymmetric and
stretch vibration of the −COO– group coordinated
with metal cations in several carboxylates, respectively, such as
zinc benzoate19 and sodium benzoate (see Figure S2). This indicates a likely similar coordination
of benzoate group with the Ni ion. We note that Ni(acac)2 has a higher complex stability constant (10.7) than Ni benzoate
(0.9), indicating that the acac ligand should be more strongly coordinated
with Ni. Therefore, the BA may act as additional ligands coordinated
with the Ni center (as illustrated in Figure 4e). However, because of much higher concentration
(2.5 mM) of BA than Ni(acac)2 (0.5 mM), direct replacement
of acac ligand by benzoate ligand cannot be excluded. In fact, several
previous works have also reported the formation of various coordination
structures including a chained structure between BA, Ni2+ ion, and water molecule.20 The preferential
coordination of BA with Ni2+ rather than Pt2+ can be ascribed to the existence of more empty 3d state in Ni2+, which allows the additional complex with BA.

Regardless
its detailed structure, the newly formed Ni complex
must have a stronger metal–ligand interaction compared to the
original Ni(acac)2 complex and thus would make the reduction
of Ni2+ more difficult, which would further impact the
growth kinetics of the octahedral Pt–Ni NPs. Following our
previous study, during the growth of the Pt–Ni octahedral NPs,
the Pt-rich phase grew first into a hexapod structure because of the
higher reduction potential of Pt2+, whereas the Ni-rich
phase deposited subsequently on the concave surface with the aid of
step sites,12 as schemed in Figure 5a. This sequential deposition
of Pt and Ni leads to the compositional segregation (Ni-rich facets
and Pt-rich edges/corners) in the final octahedral PtNi alloy NPs.
In the presence of BA, the reduction rate of Ni was further slowed
down so that reduction/deposition of Ni may no longer catch up the
reduction/deposition of Pt (Figure 5b). In this context, the preformed Pt-rich hexapods
will finally grow into Pt-rich octahedral NPs. Once Pt-rich octahedral
NPs complete, there will be no step sites for accommodating Ni deposition.
In addition, the absorbed BA on the surface of the Pt-rich nucleus
may also inhibit the successive deposition of Ni atoms. Therefore,
separate pure Ni NPs have to nucleate and grow separately, whereas
the preformed Pt-rich octahedral NPs showed a lower extent of alloying
compared those prepared without BA, fully consistent with the XRD
results.

Figure 5 Schematic illustration of the elemental growth mechanism and alloying
structure of Pt–Ni octahedral NPs without (a) and with (b)
BA.

Figure 6 further
compares the ORR catalytic activities of the Pt–Ni NPs synthesized
with and without BA. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA)
of the Pt–Ni NPs prepared with BA is generally larger than
those prepared without BA because of the smaller particle sizes of
the former (see Table 1). To compare their activities, we calculated the kinetic current
at 0.9 V from the ORR polarization curves and normalized them by both
the ECSA and the Pt mass. The mass activities of the PtNi-BA catalysts
have no obvious advantage over the PtNi catalysts and even showed
lower mass activity at 140 and 180 °C. More importantly, the
specific activity of the PtNi catalysts is substantially higher than
that of PtNi-BA catalysts. This is consistent with the higher Ni content
and higher alloying extent in the former. Generally, a higher alloying
degree means a higher Ni content in the Pt–Ni alloy phase.
This would result in higher content of Ni at the subsurface region
of the dealloyed Pt–Ni NPs during the ORR test, which would
further lead to a higher extent of compressive strain on the Pt-rich
surface and thus a higher ORR activity.16,21 Therefore,
although the addition of BA reduces the size of the NPs and increases
the ECSA, the phase separation caused by BA results in a decrease
in the intrinsic specific activity of the PtNi octahedral NPs because
of the attenuation of the Ni-induced strain and ligand effects.

We further evaluated the electrochemical durability of the PtNi
and PtNi-BA catalysts by conducting the accelerated durability test
between 0.6 and 1.0 V in N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 at a scan rate of 50 mV/s (Figure 7). After 4000 cycles, the mass activities of PtNi-140-BA,
PtNi-160-BA, and PtNi-180-BA decayed by 69, 68, and 57%, respectively,
whereas PtNi-140, PtNi-160, and PtNi-180 decayed by 47, 52, and 54%,
respectively. This result shows that the PtNi octahedral NPs synthesized
without BA are more stable than the PtNi-BA octahedral NPs with BA.
This is due to the smaller NPs synthesized with BA possessed increased
ratio of atoms at low-coordination sites, which are more prone to
oxidation and dissolution and easier to diffuse from the vertex and
edge to the center, thereby losing the octahedron morphology and showing
decreased catalytic activity.

Conclusions
We studied the effect
of BA on the morphology and structure of
the Pt–Ni octahedral NPs synthesized by the DMF-solvothermal
synthesis. Regardless of the presence or absence of BA, octahedral
Pt–Ni NPs can be steadily synthesized in the DMF solvent, indicating
a minor role of BA in selective protecting of the {111} facets. Moreover,
besides the conventional effect in inhibiting the NP growth and hence
decreased the particle size, we found that BA preferentially changed
the reduction/deposition kinetics of Ni by forming a new complex compound
with Ni2+, leading to slower reduction/deposition rate
of Ni and thereby a phase separation (i.e., the coexistence of Pt-rich
alloy NPs and pure Ni NPs) in the final product. Therefore, in the
presence of BA, the Pt–Ni octahedral NPs showed not only much
smaller particle size but also a low alloying extent because of the
formation a separate pure Ni NPs, which further lead to lower ORR
electrocatalytic activity and stability. Our results demonstrate that
the metal–ligand coordination chemistry can not only determine
the morphology/shape but also the elemental reduction kinetics and
alloying structure of bimetallic NPs.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Platinum(II) acetylacetonate [Pt(acac)2], nickel(II)
acetylacetonate [Ni(acac)2], and
BA were purchased from Alfa Aesar. DMF and anhydrous ethanol were
purchased from Sinopharm. Nafion solution (5 wt %) and isopropanol
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the chemicals were used
as received without further purification. The water (18 MΩ/cm)
used in all experiments was purified through a Milli-Q lab system
(Nihon Millipore Ltd.).

Synthesis of Pt–Ni NPs
In
a typical synthesis
of octahedral Pt–Ni NPs, 0.2 mmol Pt(acac)2, 0.5
mmol Ni(acac)2, and 209 mg of Vulcan XC-72 carbon support
were mixed together in 50 mL of DMF, followed by 10 min vigorous stirring.
The resulting homogeneous solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lines
stainless-steel autoclave. The sealed vessel was then heated from
room temperature to different reaction temperatures (120, 140, 160,
180, and 200 °C) for 42 h before it was naturally cooled down
to room temperature. The products were collected by centrifugation
and washed with ethanol/water three times. The as-synthesized NPs
were denoted as PtNi-120, PtNi-140, PtNi-160, PtNi-180, and PtNi-200.
The octahedral Pt–Ni NPs with BA were synthesized following
the same procedure except by adding 2.5 mmol BA to the solution before
stirring. The as-synthesized NPs were denoted as PtNi-120-BA, PtNi-140-BA,
PtNi-160-BA, PtNi-180-BA, and PtNi-200-BA.

Materials Characterization
TEM images were conducted
on a FEI Tecnai G2 spirit operated at an accelerating voltage
of 120 kV. The real metal loading and composition of the Pt–Ni
NPs was measured by ICP optical emission spectrometry (ARCOS II MV
SPECTRO). XRD patterns were collected on a D8 ADVANCE-diffractometer
(Bruker) equipped with a LynxEye detector and KFL Cu 2K X-ray tube.
UV/vis spectroscopy was carried out on an Agilent Cary 5000 spectrometer.
The FTIR spectra were measured on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50
spectrometer by placing a few drops of the solution on the surface
of a diamond cell.

Electrochemical Measurements
The
catalyst ink was prepared
by mixing 5 mg of carbon-supported Pt–Ni catalysts in 5 mL
of a mixed solution of ultrapure water, isopropanol solution, and
5 wt % Nafion, which was then ultrasonicated for 15 min. A 10 μL
aliquot was added dropwise onto a 5 mm-in-diameter rotating disk electrode
(RDE), resulting in nominal Pt loading of about 6 μg/cm2. The ink was dried in an oven at 50 °C for 20 min forming
a uniform thin film at the RDE surface. A Pt wire and a saturated
Hg/Hg2SO4 were used as counter electrode and
reference electrode, respectively. All electrode potentials were recorded
with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and iR-compensated. Before testing the oxygen reduction activities,
cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in N2-saturated 0.1
M HClO4 solution between 0.05 and 1.0 V at 100 mV/s for
20 cycles. The 20th potential cycle was recorded to evaluate the ECSA.
Linear sweep voltammetry was then conducted in O2-saturated
0.1 M HClO4 solution from 0.05 to 1.0 V at 5 mV/s (1600
rpm). The stability test was performed between 0.6 and 1.0 V in N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 at 50 mV/s for 4000 cycles.
