A polydimethylsiloxane-based
microfluidic device has been developed
for the multiplex detection of viral envelope proteins such as Zika
and chikungunya on a single platform using aptamer–analyte
interactions. The channel is integrated with microsized pillars that
increase the surface area allowing more aptamers to attach to the
incoming envelope protein molecules, thus increasing the overall sensitivity
of the system. The working of the device depends on the formation
of protein-mediated sandwich morphology that is obtained using an
aptamer and aptamer-functionalized gold nanoparticle (AuNP) pair.
The colorimetric signal is obtained upon introduction of silver reagents
into the channel, which are selectively deposited on the AuNP surface,
providing a gray contrast in the testing zone. The microfluidic channel
approach successfully detected clinically relevant concentrations
of Zika and chikungunya envelope proteins in phosphine-buffered saline
(1 pM) and calf blood (100 pM) with high specificity using gold-decorated
aptamers integrated in a microfluidic channel.

1 Introduction
Zika
fever is a mosquito-borne illness caused by Zika virus (ZIKV)
that is vectored by Aedes (Ae.) genus mosquitoes such as Ae.
aegypti.1,2 ZIKV is known to pose
a serious threat to the population worldwide; for example, nearly
440000 cases of Zika fever associated with microcephaly and central
nervous system abnormalities were reported during the Zika outbreak
in Brazil in 2015.3,4 Besides Brazil, cases associated
with ZIKV infection have also been reported in 66 other countries
to date.5 The World Health Organization
(WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC) in 2016 because of the increase in microcephaly cases and
neurological disorders that were associated with ZIKV infection.6 More than 5000 cases since 2016 have been confirmed
in United States alone as reported by the Pan American Health Organization.3 The transmission of ZIKV occurs through the bite
of a ZIKV-infected mosquito, in utero from mother to fetus and via
sexual contact with an infected person.2,7−9 ZIKV infection is usually asymptomatic; however, nonspecific symptoms
such as rash, fever, headache, vomiting, and joint pains of varying
degrees are sometimes observed.10,11 These symptoms overlap
significantly with other arboviral infections such as chikungunya
(CHIKV). Because of a shared mosquito vector as well as nonspecific
symptoms, adequate diagnosis of ZIKV infection at an early stage poses
a serious challenge, especially in resource-constrained communities
where both the viral infections are endemic.

The current diagnostic
tools for the detection of ZIKV are mainly
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),10 reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (RT-LAMP),12−16 and reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA)17 methods, coupled with external power source
and a display unit such as smart phone for an easy readout signal.18−24 These techniques often require expensive instrumentation and skilled
labor and sometimes face major disadvantages of false negative/positive
results arising from new strains or contamination.25 Other methods for diagnosis of ZIKV infection such as IgM-capture
ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and plaque reduction neutralization
test face a major challenge of cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses25 leading to ambiguous results. Therefore, there
is a dire need for the development of novel, compact, and passive
point-of-care (POC) testing tools which can provide early diagnosis
of a disease leading to a more consumer-driven health care.

To this end, we have fabricated a flexible, portable, easy-to-use
aptamer-based device for the multiplex detection of recombinant ZIKV
and CHIKV envelope proteins. Aptamers are short single-stranded oligonucleotides
that are designed using in vitro SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands
by exponential enrichment) process to bind to a specific target with
high specificity and affinity.26,27 Aptamers offer several
advantages over antibodies such as stability in a wider range of environments,
are more readily synthesized and functionalized, have higher batch-to-batch
consistency, and can be generated against a wider variety of targets.28−32 Herein, these aptamers are integrated in a microfluidic platform,
which allows for the manipulation of fluids at the micron scale and
is frequently used to distill/translate/convert operations that originally
required large, expensive equipment onto a micron-sized device.33,34 For the present study, the compatibility of polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) with microfluidic fabrication offers flexibility and optical
transparency, which facilitates observation of the colorimetric signals
produced in the presence of analytes during the test.

The current
sensor depends on the engineered sandwich morphology
consisting of aptamer1–antigen–aptamer2 for the detection
of ZIKA and CHIKV antigens (Figure 1). Aptamer1 is immobilized on the microfluidic channel,
which captures the incoming protein present in the samples. Aptamer2
conjugated with gold nanoparticles (Apt-AuNPs) is used to report the
presence of antigen by generating an output signal in the form of
color change. A silver staining technique has been used to further
amplify the color change facilitating colorimetric detection by eye.35,36 In close proximity of silver ions, AuNPs serve as an electron-transferring
agent from the reducing agent (e.g., hydroquinone) to silver ions.36,37 This leads to the deposition of metal silver over the surface of
AuNPs, which catalyzes the subsequent reactions themselves. This process
leads to continuous deposition of silver over gold, which produces
gray color in the testing zone. The intensity of developed color depends
on the concentration of analyte-bound Apt-AuNPs over the channel surface.
Thus, the present technique provides a quantitative and qualitative
strategy toward detecting arboviral proteins (antigens). The major
advantage of using an antigen capture sandwich assay is high sensitivity
and colorimetric detection capabilities with crude sample preparation.38 The approach is similar to the ELISA technique
but avoids the use of expensive plates and plate readers and is very
easy to handle. Also, the replacement of antibodies with aptamers
makes this technique more robust while maintaining the same level
of accuracy and reliability of the approach.

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of the working of current approach based
on sandwich morphology for the detection of multiple viral envelope
proteins on a single platform. The surface is first conjugated with
a linker molecule, PMPI, that attaches to the thiolated end of the
aptamers (1); the control site is blocked with bovine serum albumin
(BSA). Sample containing viral envelope protein(s) is introduced in
the channel where the aptamers specific for this protein bind the
target (2). AuNPs conjugated with protein-specific aptamers are then
flowed in and bind to other free epitopes on the previously captured
envelope protein(s) to form a sandwich morphology (3); if no arboviral
envelope protein is present, AuNPs will be washed away. Finally, silver
reagents are introduced into the channel, which get deposited onto
the surface of bound AuNPs, thereby generating a colorimetric signal
indicating the presence of arboviral envelope protein (4).

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Chemical Reagents
Recombinant Zika
virus (ZIKV) envelope protein (ZKV-005) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV)
type E1 envelope protein (CHI-001) were obtained from ProSpec (Rehovot,
Israel). The protein samples were provided to Base Pair Biotechnologies
(BPB, Pearland, TX) for synthesizing custom-made aptamers with thiol
functionalization. The aptamers showing highest binding affinity were
used for experimentation. Aptamer folding buffer, reducing buffer,
and resuspension buffer were also provided by BPB to prepare the aptamers
for immobilization. Other chemicals such as gold(III) chloride trihydrate,
trisodium citrate, phosphine-buffered saline (PBS) tablets, sodium
hydroxide, hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), acetonitrile, and magnesium
chloride (MgCl2) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). PMPI (p-maleimidophenyl isocyanate) used
for the functionalization of PDMS was obtained from Thermo Fisher
(Waltham, MA). Dow Corning Sylgard 184 Silicone Encapsulant Clear
Kit for the fabrication of microfluidic channels was purchased from
Ellsworth (Germantown, WI). SU8 and SU8 developer used during photolithography
were purchased from MicroChem (Westborough, MA). The masks were printed
by CAD/Art Services (Bandon, OR). The silver enhancement kit was purchased
from Cytodiagnostics (Burlington, ON). Silicon wafers were obtained
from Waferworld Inc. (West Palm Beach, FL). Sterile, mechanically
defibrinated bovine/calf blood was obtained from Rockland Immunochemicals
Inc. (Limerick, PA) and sheep serum was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The entire study was done using DNAse–RNAse-free water, vials
and pipette tips, obtained from Thermo Fisher.

2.2 Fabrication
of Microfluidic Channel
2.2.1 Fabrication of Master
Mold
PDMS-based
microfluidic channels were fabricated using a soft lithography technique
(Figure S1).39 The silicon wafers were cleaned thoroughly by rinsing with acetone,
isopropanol, and water, followed by nitrogen blow. These were baked
at 80 °C for 15 min to evaporate any residual water. After cleaning,
the wafers were pretreated with HMDS overnight to improve the adhesion
between the photoresist layer and wafer surface. The HMDS-treated
wafers were deposited with SU8 photoresist for the development of
master mold. The wafer was centered on the rotating stage of the spin
coater and a dollop of SU8-2050 was poured in the center. SU-8 was
spin-coated over the wafer at 2500 rpm for 50 s, which gave an average
thickness of 40–60 μm of the layer. After spinning, the
wafer was soft-baked at 65 °C for 3 min, followed by 95 °C
for 8 min. The wafer was allowed to cool at room temperature for 5
min. The next step in the lithography is to transfer the pattern of
the mask onto the SU8-deposited Si wafer. The mask was placed over
the Si wafer in the mask aligner and exposed to UV (275 nm) for 50
s. After UV exposure, the silicon wafers were baked for 1 min at 65
°C, followed by a 6 min bake at 95 °C. Upon cooling, the
wafers were developed in copious amount of SU-8 developer for 5 min,
followed by rinsing with isopropanol. If white streaks were seen,
the wafers were again kept in a fresh developer solution for few seconds
and then rinsed with isopropyl alcohol. The developed wafers were
dried using nitrogen blow and baked at 95 °C for 3 min. The fabricated
master molds were silanized using tricholorsilane for 2 h under vacuum
to make the peeling step easier.

2.2.2 Development
of Microfluidic Channels
The PDMS mixture was formed by adding
the base and cross-linker (provided
in the Dow Corning kit) in 10:1 weight ratio in a disposable plastic
weigh boat. The mixture was thoroughly mixed with a plastic-stir rod
until it became cloudy and suspended with air bubbles. The air bubbles
were removed by placing the boat under vacuum in a desiccator and
venting the desiccator periodically. Once all the air bubbles were
removed, the PDMS mixture was poured slowly onto the master mold in
a Petri dish. The Petri dish was then placed in a preheated oven at
65 °C for 1 h to cure. After curing, the PDMS hardened over the
mold and took the features of the mold as shown in Figure S2. It was then peeled off carefully and individual
channels were cut using a sharp blade. The entire channel length was
4.5 cm and the depth was measured to be around 45 μm using a
Dektak instrument (as shown in Figure S3). The diameter of the testing zone was maintained at 0.5 cm. Figure S4 shows a digital image of a single microfluidic
channel. The red color solution represents the AuNP solution in the
channel.

2.2.3 Surface Treatment of
Microfluidic Channels
The microfluidic channels were treated
with 1 mM NaOH solution
at room temperature for 16 h under gentle shaking. The samples were
then washed thoroughly with DNase–RNase-free water, followed
by drying with nitrogen blow. After this, PMPI dissolved in acetonitrile
(10 mg/mL) was applied onto the testing regions and kept for 3 h at
room temperature. The surface treatment of PDMS with PMPI offers a
free maleimide group, which shows high affinity toward the thiol bond
present at the end of aptamers. The samples were washed with acetonitrile
and working buffer (1 mM MgCl2, 1× PBS, pH 7.5) thrice
before conjugating with aptamers.

2.3 Preparation
of Aptamers and Immobilization
The obtained thiolated aptamers
(CHIKV E1 and ZIKV envelope) were
dissolved in resuspension buffer to achieve a 100 μM stock concentration.
The aptamers were diluted to 50 μM using a folding buffer and
heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Then, these were cooled to room temperature
for 15 min. This allows the aptamers to fold properly and attain their
native conformation required for binding to the target molecule. After
15 min, the aptamer solution was mixed with the reducing buffer (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine,
TCEP) in 1:1 ratio (v/v) to obtain a final concentration of 25 μM
and kept at room temperature for another 20 min. TCEP is used to cleave
the disulfide bonds (−S–S−), which allows for
free −SH group. The −SH group plays a major role in
binding of the aptamers to the AuNPs as well as the PDMS surface.

2.3.1 Immobilization on AuNPs
AuNPs were
synthesized using a standard Turkevich method in which a gold chloride
precursor salt is reduced using trisodium citrate at high temperature.40−42 The aptamers were immobilized on the AuNP surface by incubating
1 mL of AuNPs (0.2 mg/mL) with 2 μM (10 μL) of reduced
aptamers at room temperature with gentle stirring overnight. The AuNP
solution was then centrifuged down (11 000 rcf, 11 min) to
remove unbound aptamers and resuspended in working buffer. The conjugation
of aptamers was confirmed by performing gel electrophoresis on bare
and aptamer-conjugated AuNPs.

2.3.2 Immobilization
on PDMS
The prepared
aptamers were added directly to the functionalized testing zone on
the microfluidic channel and allowed to sit for 3 h with gentle stirring.
The final concentration of the aptamers used for each testing zone
was 25 μM, 20 μL. After 3 h of incubation, the channels
were washed gently with working buffer to remove unbound aptamers.
To avoid nonspecific binding of the protein, the channels were then
passivated using 1% BSA for 1 h.

2.4 Silver
Staining Procedure
The silver
staining kit containing two different solutions—solution A
(silver precursor) and solution B (reducing agent, e.g., hydroquinone)—was
obtained commercially. These solutions were diluted in half and mixed
in equal ratios (1:1) right before adding in the microfluidic channel.
This mixture was allowed to flow through the channel for 10 min by
maintaining a constant flow rate of 80 μL/min. At the end, the
channel was washed with deionized water for 15 min to stop the reaction
and remove excess silver from the channel. The presence of AuNPs allowed
the deposition of silver in the testing zone, which provided gray
color in the channel.

3 Results and Discussions
The fabricated microfluidic channels were embedded with micro-sized
pillars to increase the surface area in the testing region. The increased
surface area ensured large numbers of aptamers in the testing zone,
which increased the binding sites for the protein molecules and thus
enhanced the sensitivity of the approach. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analysis shown in Figure 2A confirms the presence of pillars in the magnified view of
the testing zone. The analysis of the vertical and lateral view (inset)
indicates that the pillars have an average diameter and height of
50 and 45 μm, respectively.

charge on the particle surface.

The microfluidic channels were treated with aqueous solution
of
NaOH to make the surface hydrophilic. Treatment with NaOH creates
a hydroxyl group (−OH) on the surface, which not only improves
the flow but also facilitates the functionalization of the surface
with other chemicals.43−45 The major advantage of using NaOH over traditional
ozone treatment is the enhanced stability of the samples irrespective
of the storage condition.43 The −OH
functionalized surface was then reacted with PMPI (p-maleimidophenyl isocyanate), that was used as a linker molecule
between aptamers and the PDMS surface. The isocyanate end (−N=C=O)
of PMPI reacts with −OH and forms urethane linkage. This renders
the maleimide end available for coupling with the thiol group present
at the end of aptamers.46−48 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) is shown in Figure 2B along with a schematic illustration of the reaction in Figure 2C. The FTIR spectrum
of PDMS–NaOH–PMPI showed peaks at 1698 and 1531 cm–1, which corresponds to amide I and amide II bands
(C=O stretching and −N–H bending), respectively.47,49,50 A distinct peak at 1585 cm–1 is also observed, which indicates the presence of
C=C in the maleimide group. After the immobilization of the
aptamers, a significant peak at ∼3410 cm–1 is observed, which is due to large number of hydroxyl groups present
on the aptamers. A peak at 1648 cm–1 is also seen,
which indicates the presence of purine and pyrimidine rings in the
aptamers.51 The FTIR data confirmed the
immobilization of aptamers over PDMS using PMPI as the linker molecule.

The characterization of the synthesized AuNPs is shown in Figure 2D,E. The UV–vis
spectrum (Figure 2D)
shows a distinctive absorbance peak at 520 nm, which represents the
surface plasmon band of the AuNPs. The transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) results indicate that the particles were uniformly distributed
and spherical in nature with an average diameter of 13 ± 2.1
nm. These particles were conjugated with ZIKV and CHIKV envelope protein-specific
aptamers using a standard protocol at a concentration of 20 nM.40 A high aptamer density results in repulsion
among the AuNPs, whereas lower aptamer density provides fewer binding
sites.28 The successful conjugation of
the aptamers onto the AuNPs was confirmed by electrophoresis of the
particles through a 0.5% agarose gel (Figure 2F). It was observed that Apt-AuNPs migrated
through the gel (red arrow), whereas bare (unconjugated) AuNPs remained
in the well (black arrow). The migration of functionalized particles
is due to the overall negative particle charge imparted by the conjugated
aptamers, which enables these Apt-AuNPs to be driven through the gel
in response to the applied voltage. Because of insufficient negative
charges on bare AuNPs,52 immediate aggregation
and color change was seen in the AuNPs in the presence of running
buffer (Tris), which inhibited the migration of the bare AuNPs through
the gel.

The present approach was first tested on a PDMS substrate
to examine
the sensitivity and selectivity of aptamers for the target arboviral
envelope proteins. A distinct color development was observed from
500 pM of CHIKV envelope protein, which intensified with increasing
protein concentrations (Figure S6). The
approach was then extended to the microfluidic channels with a controlled
flow rate (80 μL/min). The aptamer-conjugated microfluidic channels
were tested against different concentrations (10 fM to 1 nM) of both
CHIKV and ZIKV envelope proteins. Figure 3A shows distinct development of silver in
the testing zones represented by circles. The “+” and
“–” signs indicate the presence or absence of
the specific arboviral envelope protein in the testing solution. For
0 nM, PBS was spiked with BSA, which was used as the negative control
to test nonspecific interactions of AuNPs in the channel. No color
development was observed in the negative control regions in any of
the channels, which indicates high specificity of Apt-AuNPs (Figure S7). Also, for the last two channels,
only one viral envelope protein (either ZIKV or CHIKV) was injected
as per the (+) or (−) symbol. It can be seen that the ZIKV
envelope protein at a very high concentration of 10 nM did not interfere
with the CHIKV aptamers and vice versa. This clearly suggests that
the current approach is not only highly sensitive with a detection
limit of 1 pM, but also exhibits high level of selectivity among different
arboviruses such as ZIKV and CHIKV.

Figure 3 (A) Digital image of microfluidic channels
representing color change
in the testing zones in the presence of different concentrations of
protein (1, 10, 100 pM, and 1 nM). The last two channels represent
the specificity of the current sensor. The sample containing only
Zika protein (10 nM) was introduced in the channel and no color change
in the CHIKV region was observed and vice versa. This shows that the
aptamers are highly specific in nature. Negative control did not produce
any color. (B) Graph represents the change in key value (CMYK color
model) calculated using ImageJ as a function of concentration of protein.
Black and white are represented as 100 and 0, respectively. It can
be seen that the key value moves toward black attributing to the increased
deposition of silver in the testing zone.

The color change in the channels was also measured using
an image
processing software to calculate the CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow,
and key) values. The key value represents the black color, which was
used as the measure of silver development in microfluidic channels.
The more number of AuNPs results in increased silver deposition in
the testing zone, leading to an intense color change. Figure 3B shows the key value with
respect to concentration of protein. It can be seen that with increasing
protein concentration, the K value increases. The
measure of K value can be used for a quantitative
estimation of an unknown viral protein concentration sample by plotting
a standard calibration curve using a known protein concentration and
the respective key value, given similar experimental conditions.

The microfluidic device was also tested against sterile, mechanically
defibrinated calf blood and complete sheep serum spiked with the given
ZIKV and CHIKV recombinant envelope proteins as surrogates for infected
human blood/blood products. The results are represented as black key
color (K) as a function of protein concentration
(Figure 4). The testing
showed a response to as low as 1 pM of the recombinant protein in
PBS and 10 pM when tested against spiked 10% calf blood (diluted with
working buffer) or sheep serum. In the case of undiluted (i.e., 100%)
calf blood, a slight increase in K value was observed in the presence
of 100 pM (∼5 ng/mL) of the protein. Diluting the blood with
the binding buffer therefore increased the sensitivity of the system
by ∼10-fold. A comparative analysis of different detection
techniques is shown in Table S1. The present
sensor gives a minimum detection limit of 1 pM (50 pg/mL) for ZIKV
envelope protein and CHIKV envelope protein E1 in PBS, which is the
lowest obtained so far. A similar detection limit (in buffer) was
also obtained by Zeng et al. using an antibody–aptamer-mediated
sandwich assay on a 96-well ELISA plate.53 The current approach abrogates the use of expensive plates or a
sophisticated plate reader, making the device more adoptable in resource-constrained
areas.

Figure 4 Development of silver in microfluidic channels as a function of
different concentrations of ZIKV and CHIKV envelop proteins (1, 10,
and 100 pM) has been represented in terms of key value (CMYK color
code). No change in K values was observed in the
presence of 1 pM of protein for both calf blood and sheep serum samples.
Serum and 10% calf blood exhibited a slight color development at 10
pM of recombinant protein. In the case of 100 pM, a distinct color
development was observed in all the three cases.

4 Conclusions
A multiplex detection system
for ZIKV and CHIKV arboviral envelope
proteins has been developed using an aptamer-conjugated microfluidic
channel approach. This novel method implements the immobilizing aptamers
to the PDMS substrate using PMPI as the linker molecule. The channels
are patterned with microsized pillars that facilitate an enhanced
sensitivity of the approach down to detections of 1 pM (50 pg/mL)
of viral envelope protein targets in PBS and 10 pM in dilute (10%)
mechanically defibrinated calf blood. The detection is based on a
silver enhancement technique that deposits a thick silver shell over
the surface of target-bound Apt-AuNPs. This enhancement enables significant
color changes on the PDMS substrate, indicating the presence of target
protein. The device also exhibited high specificity toward the target
protein with no interference from other, off-target arboviral proteins.
The use of aptamers as the biorecognition molecule provides flexibility
to incorporate additional or alternative targets by designing the
specific aptamers and immobilizing them in the microfluidic channel.
The present approach can be extended to detect other clinically important
biomarkers for which there are few POC options available.
