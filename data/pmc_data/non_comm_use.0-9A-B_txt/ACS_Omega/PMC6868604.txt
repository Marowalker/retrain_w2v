A novel bioorthogonal gold nanoparticle
(AuNP) template displaying
interfacial nitrone functional groups for bioorthogonal interfacial
strain-promoted alkyne–nitrone cycloaddition reactions has
been synthesized. These nitrone–AuNPs were characterized in
detail using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and a nanoparticle raw formula was
calculated. The ability to control the conjugation of molecules of
interest at the molecular level onto the nitrone–AuNP template
allowed us to create a novel methodology for the synthesis of AuNP-based
radiolabeled probes.

Introduction
Positron emission tomography
(PET) is a noninvasive imaging technique
that provides valuable real-time information on physiological, biochemical,
and pharmacological processes that take place in living organisms.1−6 The engineering and synthesis of radiolabeled probes for medical
imaging with PET is an area of chemistry that is extremely active
and rich in challenges, which includes solubility and biological stability,
control of biodistribution, and preserving molar activity. Among the
different PET radionucleotides, the most employed is fluorine-18 (18F) because of its particularly favorable nuclear and chemical
properties: it offers a half-life of 110 min, a β+-branch of 97%, and a low β+-energy of 635 keV.
This allows for its facile off-site production and transportation,
for relatively long imaging experiments, and the acquisition of images
with higher resolution than those obtained using other radionuclides.7

One of the most common strategies for the
synthesis of robust and
efficient PET probes involves the use of radiolabeled prosthetic groups
that are then introduced onto the biomolecular system of interest
in the last step of synthesis. This type of synthesis involves a continuous
race against time and the decay of the radionuclide. In fact, the
biggest challenge involves the development of synthetic steps with
high reaction rates, high yields, and that take place under mild reaction
conditions while using sub-micromolar amounts of radiolabeled compounds.7−18

In recent years, bioorthogonal chemistry has started to revolutionize
the synthesis of radiolabeled probes, in particular for higher molecular
weight biologics. In fact, bioorthogonal reactions represent ideal
candidates for those critical synthetic steps because of their robustness,
versatility, fast kinetics, high yields, and mild conditions. Most
importantly, they have the potential to lead to easier and faster
synthetic protocols for the synthesis of radioactive biologics and
nanoparticles, with straightforward and approachable methods for users
with basic chemistry skills.

One of the most useful bioorthogonal
reactions is the strain-promoted
alkyne–azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). This is a variation of
the copper (I)-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition (CuAAC), whose driving
force relies on a strained C–C triple bond imbedded in an eight-membered
ring. Most importantly, the SPAAC reaction does not require the use
of cytotoxic metal catalysts, overcoming the problems associated with
their application, such as cytotoxicity, copper-promoted degradation
of peptides and proteins, and formation of insoluble copper acetylide.19−22 The typical complementary functional group or chemical reporter
of the strained alkyne is the azide because of its small dimension,
stability, and biological inertness. However, utilizing more reactive
alternatives to azides can greatly enhance the reaction rate of strain-promoted
cycloaddition, with the potential of impacting even more the synthesis
of radiolabeled probes.

Recently, a variant to SPAAC has been
proposed, which replaces
the azido functionality with a stable and biocompatible nitrone group.
The bioorthogonal strain-promoted alkyne–nitrone cycloaddition
(SPANC) reaction represents an improvement of the SPAAC because of
its faster reaction kinetics as well as tunability of the nitrone
moiety by using diverse substituents on both carbon and nitrogen atoms
of the dipole.23,24 The SPANC reaction has quickly
found applications that range from protein modification25,26 and cell surface labeling,24 to materials
science27 and radiolabelling.9−18,28 Nevertheless, it is surprising
how to date it has not found an application in the synthesis of radiolabeled
nanomaterials.

With the final goal of engineering radiolabeled
contrast agents
with higher spatial and temporal resolution, in recent years, radiochemists
have started to approach the field of nanomaterials because of their
attractive physical, chemical, and biological properties.29−31 In particular, gold-based nanomaterials represent an ideal multitasking
imaging probe because of their stability, biocompatibility, facile
conjugation to biomolecules, and their unique physical–chemical
properties. These characteristics make them useful as multimodal contrast
agents and as photodynamic therapy-contrast agents.32−37 An additional characteristic that makes them desirable in the field
of biomedical imaging is that their size, shape, and surface charge
can be easily tuned through the synthesis, and the cellular and tissue
uptake can potentially be regulated.35,38−41

Normally, gold nanomaterials-based radiolabeled probes are
synthesized
either by deposition of a radioactive element (e.g., 64Cu, 125I, and 198Au) onto the nanostructure35,36,38,42,43 or by conjugating chelating agents (e.g.,
DOTA) or prosthetic groups carrying the radioactive element onto the
nanomaterial corona.39,44 However, the former methodology
has the drawback that the size and shape of the nanomaterial substrate
can change during the redox reaction, causing destabilization of the
nanoparticle or irreversible aggregation.38 As a consequence, the precise characterization of both the metallic
core and organic corona becomes extremely challenging or even impossible.
The latter method instead relies on a “shotgun-type”
conjugation approach, which has no control over the extent of incorporation
of the desired radiolabeled prosthetic group or its quantification,
representing a major issue for potential therapeutic applications.39,44,45

In the past few years,
the Workentin research group has begun to
develop a toolbox of bioorthogonal nanomaterial templates. These are
stable (i.e., can be stored for indefinitely long periods of time
under appropriate conditions) and biocompatible nanomaterials that
display interfacial bioorthogonal moieties that are ready to react
with any molecular system of interest that carries the complementary
functional group or chemical reporter. The bioorthogonal nanomaterial
template allows for the facile and covalent modification of the nanomaterial’s
surface with reactions that are chemoselective, biocompatible, fast,
high yielding, and, most importantly, orthogonal to the surface chemistry
of the nanomaterial.46−52

In this study, we further expanded the members of this bioorthogonal
nanomaterial toolbox and synthesized and characterized small (∼3
nm) AuNPs functionalized with interfacial nitrone functional groups
(nitrone–AuNPs) for interfacial SPANC (I-SPANC) reactions.
This new bioorthogonal AuNP template is extremely resilient because
the gold core is protected by a monolayer of tri- and tetra-ethylene
glycol-based thiolated ligands (see Scheme 1). This allows the nitrone–AuNPs to
be stored indefinitely at −20 °C and be repeatedly dried
and redissolved in polar organic solvents and water with little to
no aggregation. The nitrone–AuNPs could be completely characterized,
thanks to the discrete size of their thiolated ligands, and the number
of interfacial nitrone moieties could be determined with good precision,
including the determination of a nanoparticle’s raw formula.
This allowed us to investigate in detail the interfacial reactivity
of the nitrone–AuNP template toward the I-SPANC reaction using
model molecules. Subsequently, we determine a facile protocol for
the realization of 18F-decorated AuNPs ([18F]AuNPs)
based on an I-SPANC reaction between the bioorthogonal nitrone–AuNP
template and a radiolabeled prosthetic group carrying a bicyclononyne
(BCN) moiety. The [18F]AuNPs showed a wide biodistribution
profile upon in vivo experiments. This is most likely because of the
small dimension of the nanomaterial and the ethylene glycol-based
coating, which increases the nanomaterial biocompatibility, hinders
protein absorption, and increases blood circulation time.53 Our approach to modification of nanomaterial
interfaces ensures molecular level control over the functionalization
of the AuNPs with the 18F-functionalized-BCN prosthetic
group and overcomes the drawbacks of the current synthetic methodologies
present in the literature. Lastly, the ability of our 18F-functionalized-BCN to react broadly with azides and nitrones opens
exciting opportunities for the modification of other biologically
relevant materials because of the ease with which azido and nitrone
moieties can be synthetically incorporated. Thus, the methodology
reported herein represents a general protocol for the preparation
of more structurally diverse and functional 18F-labeled
PET probes.

Results and Discussion
The method for the introduction of the nitrone moiety onto the
AuNP’s surface requires the synthesis of the appropriate thiol-containing
ligand to be used for the ligand exchange reaction with a 3 nm triethylene
glycol monomethyl ether AuNP (TEG–AuNP) starting material.
The TEG–AuNPs represent an ideal substrate for the synthesis
of a bioorthogonal nanomaterial template because of their approachable
synthesis, the possibility to synthesize them in the gram scale, and
the possibility of using spectroscopic techniques [e.g., nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)] for characterizing them and
following their interfacial reactivity. The TEG–AuNP template
is amphiphilic and extremely resilient. In fact, TEG–AuNPs
can be repeatedly dried and redissolved in water and different polar
organic solvents, dissolved in strongly acidic49 or basic solution,54 heated
at more than 100 °C for prolonged periods of time55 with little to no aggregation, and be exposed
to glutathione-rich aqueous environments with minimal evidence of
ligand exchange as per 1H NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy.54 The ethylene glycol framework has also the potential
function of prolonging the AuNP’s circulation half-life, and
reducing the AuNP’s immunogenicity, making the nanosystem suitable
for many applications in both chemical biology and nanomedicine.56−58 The desired nitrone-terminated ligand 4 was designed
with a tetraethylene glycol unit that separates the thiol head from
the nitrone moiety (see Scheme 1). The ethylene glycol linker preserves the physical–chemical
and biological properties of the AuNPs, ensures good packing of the
monolayer around the gold core, and, because of the extra ethylene
glycol unit, it allows the nitrone group to extend out of the corona
and be more accessible to react through the I-SPANC. It is worth
noting that the complementary system in which AuNPs are functionalized
with strained alkynes capable of reacting with [18F]-bearing
nitrones is also possible. However, this presents additional synthetic
challenges relating to undesired side reactivity of the strained C–C
triple bond toward the nucleophilic −SH. More importantly,
we wished to preserve the generality of the [18F]-bearing
prosthetic group, which can react broadly with azides and nitrones.
Because of the chemical stability and ease-of-introduction of azide
and nitrone groups onto diverse materials, we envisioned this represents
a more general protocol for the preparation of functional PET probes.

The synthetic strategy for the synthesis of the nitrone-terminated
thiol ligand 4 is reported in Scheme 1. Briefly, tetraethylene glycol-monosulfonate
HO–EG4–OTos was treated with triphenylmethanethiol
to prepare the protected thiol HO–EG4–SCPh31. The alcohol moiety of compound 1 was then oxidized to aldehyde using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
phosphorus pentaoxide. Aldehyde 2 was reacted with N-methyl hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of
a base to afford nitrone 3. Finally, the desired nitrone-terminated
thiol ligand 4 was synthesized by deprotecting nitrone 3 in CH2Cl2/5% trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA). Details of the synthetic procedure can be found in the Supporting Information. Subsequently, a ligand
exchange reaction was used to incorporate the nitrone-terminated thiol 4 onto the TEG–AuNPs (see Scheme 1). The ligand exchange reaction was carried
out by stirring a solution of TEG–AuNPs and ligand 4 (1:6 AuNPs to ligand 4 ratio) in CH2Cl2 for 30 min. After removing the solvent, the resulting film
of AuNPs was washed with a mixture of 10:1 hexanes/isopropanol five
times in order to remove any free thiol or disulfide. Finally, the
nitrone–AuNPs were further purified by dialysis in Milli-Q
water overnight. The resulting nitrone–AuNPs retained the solubility
properties of the TEG–AuNP starting material, being soluble
in water and polar organic solvents.

Characterization of the
nitrone–AuNPs was achieved using 1H NMR spectroscopy,
transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and XPS. Initially, the success
of the place exchange reaction was confirmed using 1H NMR
spectroscopy, see Figure 1. The 1H NMR spectrum of the nitrone–AuNPs
recorded in D2O exhibited the expected broad peaks at δH: 3.3–3.8 ppm because of the protons of the ethylene
glycol units. Additionally, new signals appeared after the exchange
reaction at δH: 7.4 and 4.4 ppm in a 1:2 ratio and
corresponded to the proton α to the nitrogen (Hb)
and the two protons of the methylene group next to the nitrone functionality
(Ha), respectively, confirming the presence of the nitrone
moiety on the AuNPs’ corona. The lack of sharp signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the nitrone–AuNPs indicates that
there was no free thiol present and confirmed the efficiency of our
cleaning protocol. Furthermore, the nitrone–AuNP sample was
monitored over an extend period of time by 1H NMR spectroscopy
and there was no evidence of free thiols, indicating very good stability
of the nanoparticle’s corona. Additionally, we observed no
hydrolysis of the interfacial nitrone moiety as indicated by no disappearance
of the nitrone’s Cα–H signal or appearance of
an aldehyde proton signal. Through the integration of the signal at
δH: 7.4 ppm, correlating to Hb, and the
integration of the signal at 3.3 ppm, corresponding to the three protons
of the terminal methyl group of the base MeO–EG3–S– ligands, it was determined that the
18 ± 2% of the thiolated ligands that compose the nanoparticle’s
organic corona comprised nitrone-terminated ligand 4,
whereas 82 ± 2% consisted of the base MeO–EG3–S– ligand.

moiety are labeled with alphabetical letters and correspond to the
protons highlighted in Scheme 1. (B) TGA of nitrone-AuNPs recorded under a stream of nitrogen
gas. (C) nitrone–AuNP’s high-resolution XPS scan of
the N 1s peak. (D) Typical TEM image of nitrone–AuNPs (scale

Further information about the
quantity and ratio of the thiolated
ligands that compose the organic corona could be obtained from the
thermogravimetric curve. The TGA showed that 33% of the mass of a
nitrone–AuNP is composed by the organic corona, see Figure 1. The first derivative
of the thermogravimetric curve (see Figure S2) showed two distinct components that were related to the two thiolated
ligands: the nitrone-terminated ligand 4 and the base
MeO–EG3–S– ligands.48 By knowing the molecular weight of the two ligands,
it was possible to calculate that 20% of the total number of ligands
were nitrone–EG4–S– and
80% were MeO–EG3–S– ligands
by mass. This was consistent with the analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum of the nitrone–AuNP.

XPS analysis further
confirmed the successful preparation of nitrone–AuNPs
and the ratio between the two different thiolated ligands (see Figures 1 and S3). The Au 4f region exhibited a pair of peaks
at 84.3 and 87.6 eV assigned to the Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 peaks, respectively, which were originated by the AuNP
cores and were shifted at higher binding energy (BE) because of the
nanoparticle size effect.59 The S 2p core
line showed the presence of two components, the S 2p3/2 at 162.8 eV and S 2p1/2 at 164.0 eV, in a 2:1 spin orbit
splitting ratio related to the Au–S bonds.60 The absence of additional components in the region 163–165
and 168–170 eV confirmed that there are no free thiols and
that our cleaning procedure was effective. Additionally, the XPS survey
spectrum of nitrone–AuNPs clearly showed the appearance of
a nitrogen peak at 399.9 eV (N 1s) with 0.6 at. %, confirming the
incorporation of the nitrone group. Furthermore, from the sulphur
to nitrogen ratio it was possible to calculate that 20% of the total
ligands on the gold core consisted of nitrone–EG4–SH, and this information was in line with the results obtained
independently through 1H NMR spectroscopy and TGA.

Finally, TEM images of nitrone–AuNPs showed that their gold
core is 2.6 ± 0.5 nm wide (Figure 1). By combining the information obtained through 1H NMR spectroscopy, TEM imaging, and TGA, and assuming that
the AuNPs have a spherical shape and are perfectly monodispersed in
size, it was possible to calculate a raw formula for the nitrone–AuNPs
of Au500(MeO–EG3–S–)200(nitrone–EG4–S–)40.61 Details of the calculations
can be found in the Supporting Information.

It is worth noting that the amount of nitrone moieties at
the AuNP’s
interface can be easily tuned through the ligand exchange by changing
the reaction time and the gold to ligand 4 ratio (see Figure S1). However, it was found that as we
increased the concentration of nitrone ligand 4 in excess
of 30% (by mole relative to MeO–EG3–S– in the monolayer), the resulting AuNPs were exclusively
soluble in water. Although this increased hydrophilicity would be
desirable for in vivo applications, because of hydrophobicity of the
[18F]-BCN prosthetic group, the resulting isoxazoline—formed
by interfacial SPANC—may display weaker water solubility. Therefore,
it is of paramount importance that the nitrone–AuNPs retain
their amphiphilicity in order to be used as phase-transfer agents,
and covalently bind those prosthetic groups in organic solvent and
carry them in water media where they can be used for their designed
application.

After confirming successful incorporation of nitrone
moieties,
we sought to evaluate the reactivity of nitrone–AuNPs toward
interfacial SPANC (I-SPANC). Because of the clean and quantitative
reactivity of SPANC,23,24 the stoichiometric information
of nitrone–AuNPs can be extended to establish the concentration
of interfacial [18F]. In order to do this and before undertaking
any radiolabeled-AuNP in vivo experiments, we performed a proof of
concept study using the fluorinated (19F) strained alkyne 13 (Scheme 2). Compound 13 was designed with a tetraethylene glycol
linker in between the strained alkyne moiety (a BCN) and the fluorine
atom in order to increase its water solubility. The detailed synthesis
and characterization of compound 13 is reported in the Supporting Information. Despite the high reactivity
of BCN, compound 13 is stable for months and can be stored
indefinitely at −20 °C.

Preparation of the 19F-Containing Prosthetic Group Compound

h; (c) compound 12, Et3N, DMF, 0 °C,
20 min. Bottom: characterization
of [19F]AuNPs.

Because we quantified
with very good precision the amount of nitrone
moieties per AuNP (0.840 μmol mg–1), for our
reactivity test, we were able to employ a 1:1 equivalent of strained
alkyne 13 to interfacial nitrones. This is remarkable
because it gives us unprecedented molecular level control over the
synthesis of conjugated and labeled AuNPs, which will assist in the
future generation of targeted agents while still controlling available
nitrone sites for late-stage radiochemistry. For future investigations,
this approach would also allow for the facile introduction of multiple
molecular systems of interest simply by altering the molar ratio of
complementary substrates. In a typical conjugation experiment, we
mixed 10 mg of nitrone–AuNPs (8.4 μmol of nitrone) with
8.4 μmol of compound 13 in a mixture CH3CN/H2O 3:1 and at room temperature. Despite bearing the
ethylene glycol linker in between the fluorine atom and the BCN moiety,
compound 13 still required an organic solvent to be dissolved.
In order to facilitate the characterization of the interfacial cycloaddition
product and obtain proof of proper interfacial reactivity, we set
up in parallel a control reaction using the model compound nitrone 7. The 1H NMR spectrum of the control reaction
showed complete conversion to the cycloaddition product as demonstrated
by the disappearance of the peaks of the starting materials, and the
appearance of the NH peak at 5.2 ppm (He), of a doublet
of triplets at 4.6 ppm belonging to CH2 alpha to the [19F] (Hf), of the BCN’s CH2 alpha
to the carbamate moiety at 4.2 ppm (Hd), of isoxazoline’s
Hc at 2.7 ppm, and of BCN’s multiplets in the 0.5–2.5
ppm region. The product of the control SPANC reaction was characterized
also by 19F NMR spectroscopy, which shows a fluorine peak
at −223.4 ppm, and by 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass
spectrometry. All the analyses confirmed a successful SPANC reaction
that proceeded cleanly and quantitatively with no generation of byproducts.
Proof for a successful I-SPANC reaction at the AuNP’s interface
could then be obtained by comparing the 1H NMR spectrum
of the control reaction product with that of the [19F]AuNPs. Figure 2 shows excellent
correspondence between the typical broad peaks of the AuNP sample
with those of the cycloaddition product 14. Furthermore,
the complete disappearance of the nitrone protons Ha and
Hb confirms a quantitative and clean I-SPANC reaction.
Complete labeling of the interfacial nitrone moieties with model compound
strained alkyne 13 was observed within 20 min. This is
consistent with our kinetics studies,51 which showed a second-order rate constant in the range of 5 ×
10–2 M–1 s–1, and literature values.62 It is worth
noting that the 1H NMR of the control reaction had to be
recorded in CDCl3 because of the limited water-solubility
of compound 14, whereas the 1H NMR of the
[19F]AuNPs could be easily recorded in D2O,
highlighting the role of the nanocarrier as a phase-transfer agent.

and referenced against residual solvents (*); (B) typical
TEM image of [19F]AuNPs (scale bar 20 nm); (C) high-resolution
XPS scan of C 1s and F 1s peaks for [19F]AuNPs.

After the I-SPANC reaction was completed and before further
characterization,
in order to ensure complete removal of any residual free prosthetic
group 13, the [19F]AuNPs were purified by
washing the nanoparticles with a 10:1 hexanes/isopropanol mixture
and by dialysis in water overnight. The purified [19F]AuNPs
were then characterized by XPS and TEM. The XPS data furnished additional
proof of successful I-SPANC reaction (see Figure 2). The XPS survey of [19F]AuNPs
shows the appearance of a peak related to the fluorine at 686.7 eV,
and the high-resolution scan of the C 1s peak exhibits the appearance
of a component at 288.0 and 289.2 eV related to O–C*=O
(carbamate group) and *C–F, respectively. The presence of the
carbamate group is also confirmed by the appearance of a shoulder
at 533.6 eV in the high-resolution scan of the O 1s peak. It should
be noted that a new component for the C–N bond of the carbamate
group should have appeared in the high-resolution scan of C 1s; however,
such a component was not observed because it falls at the same BE
region of the C–OH/O–C–O groups. Nonetheless,
the presence of such a group is clearly shown in the high-resolution
N 1s scan with a BE of ∼400 eV. Finally, TEM images (see Figure 2) show no change
in size, shape, or size distribution for the [19F]AuNPs
compared to the nitrone–AuNPs starting material. This is because
of the mild reaction condition required by the I-SPANC reaction. Together,
these results confirmed unequivocally that the nitrone–AuNPs
were able to react with the fluorinated compound 13 through
the I-SPANC to give the corresponding cycloaddition product rapidly,
cleanly, and quantitatively. Because the nitrone–AuNPs reacted
quantitatively, we established that each AuNP is now carrying on average
40 [19F] prosthetic groups, or ∼0.84 μmol
of compound 13 per milligram of AuNPs. This information
is of great importance for the use of the final [18F]AuNP
as a PET contrast agent and the development of targeted agents. Most
importantly, no loss of thiolated ligands was observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (which would show appearance of sharp signals)
over a period of 3 days at room temperature, indicating good stability
of the nanomaterial and potential for in vivo studies.

Once
we confirmed our ability to modify and quantify AuNPs with 19F as a model via I-SPANC, we proceeded with the synthesis
of the [18F] analogue of prosthetic group 13, its conjugation onto the nitrone–AuNPs, and the in vivo
biodistribution investigation through PET imaging. The synthesis of
[18F]AuNPs is reported in Scheme 3, and it is based on the synthetic strategy
for compound 13 with minor changes in order to satisfy
the radiolabeling working conditions. Most importantly, from the step
that introduces the fluorine atom on compound 9, all
the subsequent reactions leading to the [18F]AuNPs PET
agent rely on excellent reaction yields and very fast reaction kinetics
to minimize decay of 18F prior to injection. Finally, the
[18F]AuNPs were purified by size exclusion chromatography
in order to remove any unreacted prosthetic group. The entire synthesis
of the [18F]AuNPs, from 18F delivery until end-of-synthesis,
was completed in 4 h and with specific activity of 52 MBq mg–1 of AuNPs. Subsequently, we proceeded with the PET imaging study.
The representative PET image and the region of interest (ROI) analysis
reported in Figure 3 show that the [18F]AuNPs displayed a broad biodistribution
profile and collected mainly in the liver, lungs, heart, kidneys,
and bladder. This was expected because of the small size of the nanoparticles
(∼3 nm) and their ethylene glycol coating that prolongs their
circulation halftime. However, there are certain aspects that make
these [18F]AuNPs unique. More specifically, the ROI analysis
confirms that the highest uptake was recorded in the liver and in
the bladder.

min after

image (right). Bottom: SUV curves at 1 h postinjection, n = 2.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of [18F]AuNPs
Reaction conditions: (a) 18F–, K2CO3, Krypofix222,
CH3CN, 90 °C, 5 min; (b) hydrazine, CH3CN/36% H2O/0.1% TFA, 60 °C, 5 min; (c) Compound 12, Et3N, CH3CN, room temperature, 20
min; followed by 60 °C, 5 min

Whereas
the liver showed a high and instantaneous accumulation
of AuNPs presumably because of accumulation via the reticuloendothelial
system, the bladder displayed a slower and more gradual accumulation
over the first 50 min after intravenous injection. This is unusual
for particles of this size, which are normally excreted very quickly
through the renal pathway, displaying short blood circulation half-life.53,63 The high accumulation in the lungs suggests that the nanoparticles
have been trapped in the vascular bed of the lungs, which is also
unusual for 3 nm AuNPs. Taken together, the biodistribution observations
suggest that these 3 nm AuNPs behave in a balanced manner, with renal
excretion occurring concomitantly with retention in the liver and
lungs. It is possible that a level of aggregation is occurring in
vivo, resulting in the unexpected liver and lung retention, as this
is typically seen only for AuNPs of >5.5 nm hydrodynamic environment.
Whereas a recent report indicates limited brain uptake for small AuNPs
(0.07–0.13% ID/g),64 brain uptake
does not appear to be significant in this instance for the PEGylated
and nitrone-modified construct and is instead similar to reports for
slightly larger AuNPs.38,39 These findings show that the
[18F]AuNPs represent a promising template for the development
of PET imaging agents, as they have a relatively nonspecific biodistribution
and long retention time. These characteristics combined with our ability
to control at the molecular level the functionalization of the AuNP’s
corona make this nanomaterial ideal for the development of PET imaging
agents for in vivo targeting of cancer or other disease states.

Conclusions
In summary, we reported a new methodology for the synthesis of
nanomaterial-based PET contrast agents that is based on the use of
bioorthogonal nanomaterial templates. We synthesized a new bioorthogonal
AuNP template based on small (∼3 nm) amphiphilic AuNPs with
interfacial nitrone functionalities. The nitrone–AuNPs were
fully characterized using a variety of techniques including 1H NMR spectroscopy, TGA, TEM, and XPS, and the amount of interfacial
nitrone moieties was calculated with good precision using independent
methods. Furthermore, the amount of interfacial nitrone moieties can
be carefully tuned through the ligand exchange reaction and their
number determined through the methodology reported here. Changing
the amount of interfacial nitrone groups has an impact on the solubility
properties of the final nanoparticle, with the possibility of making
it water-soluble, amphiphilic, or organic solvent-soluble, depending
on the desired application.

For the first time, we then showcased
the utility of the I-SPANC
reaction and bioorthogonal nanomaterial templates for the preparation
of a radiolabeled probe. We prepared 18F-labeled AuNPs
by reacting the nitrone groups present on the nanoparticle’s
surface with a radiolabeled prosthetic group incorporating a strained
alkyne. The I-SPANC reaction was quantitative when using the 19F-surrogate and the prosthetic group was covalently bound
to the nanocarrier. Most importantly, the final [18F]AuNPs
retained their water-solubility despite the lipophilicity of the prosthetic
group, thanks to the ability of the nitrone–AuNP template to
act as phase-transfer agent. The resulting PET imaging agent was then
tested in vivo, which displayed broad biodistribution, and relatively
low uptake in background organs of the kidney, lung, and heart.

Importantly, through employing an AuNP nanocarrier, one can overcome
the limitations of injecting “free” radiolabeled agents
directly, which are often disadvantaged because of nonspecific biodistribution,
and limited tunability of their structural and chemical properties.
Instead, nitrone–AuNPs represent a versatile tool on which
simultaneous and multivalent attachment of radiolabeled prosthetic
groups, biomolecules, and drugs can be achieved with molecular level
control. This allows for in vivo targeting or labeling of chemical
reporters because of the bioorthogonal nature of I-SPANC. Furthermore,
although [18F]-labeled AuNPs are reported here, the generality
of the [18F]-BCN prosthetic group and its ability to broadly
react with azido and nitrone functionalities on other materials or
biomolecules opens unprecedented opportunities for the preparation
of more diverse PET imaging tools via simple “pour and mix”
chemistry.

Materials and Methods
The following reagents were used
as received. Triethylene glycol
monomethylether (MeO–EG3–OH), tetraethylene
glycol (HO–EG4–OH), 4-dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP), potassium thioacetate, deuterated acetonitrile (CD3CN), deuterated chloroform (CDCl3), phosphorous pentoxide
(P2O5), tetrachloroauric acid trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (TosCl), N-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (CH3NHOH·HCl),
sodium azide (NaN3), triphenylmethanethiol (HSCPh3), triisopropylsilane (TIPS), N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), phthalimide potassium, sodium iodide
(NaI), hydrazine monohydrate (H2N–NH2·H2O), cesium fluoride (CsF), and O-(benzotriazole-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All
common solvents, triethyleneamine (Et3N), sodium sulfate
anhydrous (Na2SO4), dry methanol (CH3OH), tert-butanol (tBuOH), hydrochloric
acid (HCl), TFA, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) were
purchased from Caledon. Deuterated water (D2O) was purchased
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Ethanol (EtOH) was purchased
from Commercial Alcohols. Glacial acetic acid (99.7%) was purchased
from BDH. Dialysis membranes (MWCO 6000–8000) were purchased
from Spectra/Por.

18F-Fluoride was obtained from
the Nordal Cyclotron
& PET Radiochemistry Facility at the Lawson Health Research Institute,
London, Canada. An automated synthesis unit (TRACERlab, GE Healthcare,
Schenectady, NY) was used to prepare and purify [18F] SA-64.
A V-10 evaporator (Biotage, Charlotte, NC) was used to remove the
solvent after high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification.
A PD-10 desalting column was purchased from GE Healthcare. HPLC analysis
and purification was performed on a Waters HPLC system (Milford, MA)
using a dual detector system (UV and radiometric), with the mobile
phase being CH3CN (solvent A)/H2O (solvent B)
containing 0.1% TFA. The HPLC columns were as follows: Sunfire RP-18
analytical column (Waters): 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, flow rate:
1.5 mL/min; Sunfire RP-18 semipreparative column (Waters): 10 ×
250 mm, 5 μm, flow rate: 4 mL/min. The UV detector was set to
λmax = 230 nm. C57/B6 mice (male, 10–12 weeks
age) were ordered from Charles River (Wilmington, MA) for PET imaging.
All animal studies were performed following the Canadian Council on
Animal Care guidelines and animal use protocol approved by the animal
facility of Western University. Imaging was performed using the Inveon
preclinical PET system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Knoxville TN) on
age-matched littermate mice using list mode scanning. Acquisition,
histograms, and reconstructions were all performed using the Siemens
Inveon acquisition and reconstruction software supplied with the scanner.

1H, and 13C and 19F {1H} NMR spectra were recorded on either a Varian Inova 400 MHz, Varian
Inova 600 MHz, or a Varian Mercury 400 MHz spectrometer and were calibrated
against the residual protonated solvents. TEM images were recorded
from a TEM Philips CM10. The TEM grids (Formvar carbon film on 400
mesh copper grids) were purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences
and prepared by drop-casting a solution of nanoparticles directly
onto the grid surface. Mass spectrometry measurements were carried
out using a Micro mass LCT (electrospray time-of-flight) mass spectrometer.
TGA measurements were recorded by loading the sample in a 70 μL
ceramic crucible and heating from 25 to 750 °C with a rate of
10 °C min–1. The experiments were performed
under a nitrogen flow of 70 mL min–1 in a Mettler
Toledo TGA/SDTA 851 instrument. The XPS analyses were carried out
with a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer using a monochromatic Al Kα
source (15 mA, 14 kV). The instrument work function was calibrated
to give a BE of 83.96 eV for the Au 4f7/2 line for metallic
gold and the spectrometer dispersion was adjusted to give a BE of
932.62 eV for the Cu 2p3/2 line of metallic copper. Specimens
were mounted on a double-sided adhesive tape and the Kratos charge
neutralizer system was used on all specimens. Survey scan analyses
were carried out with an analysis area of 300 × 700 microns and
pass energy of 160 eV. High-resolution analyses were carried out with
an analysis area of 300 × 700 microns and pass energy of 20 eV.
Spectra have been charge-corrected when needed to the main line of
the carbon 1s spectrum set to 285.0 eV for aliphatic carbon. Spectra
were analyzed using CasaXPS software (version 2.3.14). UV–vis
spectra were collected employing a Varian Cary 300 Bio spectrometer
in CH3CN. The FTIR spectra were carried out using KBr pellets
on a Bruker VECTOR33 spectrometer.
