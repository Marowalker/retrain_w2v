An
azine-based molybdenum (Mo(VI)) complex (M1) is exploited for
selective detection of thorium (Th(IV)) ions through a metal-ion displacement
protocol. Th(IV) displaces Mo(VI) from M1 instantly leading to the
formation of the Th(IV) complex, having orange-red emission. Consequently,
a red shift of the emission wavelength along with 41-fold fluorescence
enhancement is observed. This unique method allows detection of Th(IV)
as low as 1.5 × 10–9 M. The displacement of
Mo(VI) from M1 by Th(IV) is established by spectroscopic studies and
kinetically followed by the stopped-flow technique. The displacement
binding constant for Th(IV) is notably strong, 4.59 × 106 M–1. Extraction of Th(IV) from aqueous
solution to the ethyl acetate medium using M1 has been achieved. The
silica-immobilized M1 efficiently enriches Th(IV) from its reservoir
through solid-phase extraction. Computational studies (density functional
theory) support experimental findings.

Introduction
In
spite of significant contribution in NMR signalling, catalytic,
biological, therapeutic, and imaging applications,1−5 selective recognition of actinides is relatively
scarce compared to transition metal ions. Actinide complexes have
charming characteristics including large Stokes’ shift, sharp
emission profile, relatively high fluorescence lifetime, light-emitting
diode, and bright emission color.6−8 Thorium, a natural radioactive
and carcinogen, is present in soil, rock, water, plant, and animals
at low abundance. Continuous exposure to thorium may cause lung, liver
diseases, and bone cancer.9−13 Potential sources of thorium to environment includes mining, processing,
and accidental release from nuclear power plants.14,15 In addition, thorium is used in ceramics, gas mantles, flame spraying,
crucibles, medicines, nonsilicate optical glass, and catalysts.15,16 Moreover, in combination with magnesium, the alloy is used for coating
tungsten wires in electronic devices, influencing grain size of plutonium
for electric lamps, manufacturing refractory materials, and so forth.
Thorium oxide is used in high-temperature laboratory crucibles.15,16 Hence, analytical determination of thorium is very relevant and
time worthy.

Techniques like chromatography, electrochemistry,
inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (MS), atomic absorption, and synchrotron
radiation X-ray spectrometry are used for determination of thorium
(Th4+). However, an instantaneous, noninvasive, inexpensive,
and utterly simple method, such as fluorescence allows highly selective
visual perception of Th4+.17

Metal displacement/exchange reactions that lead to thermodynamically17 more stable structures are extremely valuable
in organometallic synthesis and catalytic cross-coupling like Stille,
Suzuki, Sonogashira, and Negishi cross-coupling reactions.18−28

For in vivo metal displacement reaction, kinetic stability/inertness
plays a key role over thermodynamic stability.29−32

Moreover, the metal displacement
approach allows highly selective
fluorescence detection of cations over a free organic probe leading
to significant advancements in recognition research.33−36

It is well known that hydrazone-based metal complexes have
been
used as drugs for cancer and leprosy. They are also used as plasticizers,
polymer stabilizers, antioxidants, polymerization inhibitors, herbicides,
insecticides, and plant stimulants.37,38

Additionally,
N–N-linked diimines known as azines, undergo
a wide variety of chemical processes and are useful derivatives for
isolation, purification, and characterization of many organic compounds.39,40

On the other hand, molybdenum complexes, precisely dioxo Mo(VI)
complexes of N, O-donor hydrazone derivatives occupied a pivotal role
in coordination chemistry,41 biological
chemistry, and catalytic transformations.42,43 Thus, above discussion highlights the importance of Th(IV) recognition,
azine-based Mo(VI) complex, and metal displacement approach for selective
recognition of trace level Th(IV). So far the literature is concerned,
few spectrophotometric probes are available for Th4+ determination.44−57

A β-diketone derivative undergoes marginal fluorescence
enhancement
in the presence of Th4+ at 500–530 nm (λEx = 360 nm).58,59 However, the probe fails to discriminate
Th4+ from UO22+, La3+,
Pb2+, and Cu2+. Moreover, the LOD (lowest detection limit) and apparent binding constant for Th4+ are very poor. A coumarin-containing oligoamide detects
Th4+ (λEx = 365 nm, λEm = 505 nm); however, La3+, Tb3+, Ho3+, Tm3+, and Gd3+ interferes. Moreover, lengthy,
hazardous synthetic route and poor LOD and binding constant limit
its practical applications.60 It is indeed
challenging to develop a fluorescence probe for heavy transition-metal
ions for their quenching action through spin–orbit coupling
or energy/electron transfer processes.

In this context, Th4+-assisted ratiometric fluorescence
enhancement of a Mo(VI) complex via the metal displacement approach
is undoubtedly a significant advancement for determination of trace
level Th4+.

Herein, an azine derivative (L), prepared
by condensing hydrazine
and 4-(N,N-diethylamino)salicylaldehyde
(Scheme S1), binds Mo(VI) through N and
O donors, leading to the eight-coordinated oxo-bridged dinuclear Mo(VI)
complex (M1), the structure of which is confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. Besides, various spectroscopic
analyses firmly establish the binding interaction between Mo(VI) and
L (Figures S1–S13 and Tables S1–S5). The density functional
theory (DFT) studies have been performed to unfold the molecular-level
interactions and origin of spectroscopic properties.

In addition,
the resulting Mo(VI) complex (M1) is utilized for
selective recognition61 of Th4+ via the metal-ion displacement approach, reflected in fluorescence
enhancement and associated color change with the formation of the
[L–Th4+] complex (M2). Spectroscopic and DFT studies
authenticated the displacement process (Figures S1–S10 and Tables S1–S5). Moreover, M1 efficiently extracts Th4+ from the aqueous
to ethyl acetate medium, allowing its enrichment.61b,61c The silica-immobilized probe (M1) is suitable for solid-phase extractive
enrichment of Th4+ from its reservoir.61d,61e

Thus, the novelty of the present work lies in the fact that
the
new Mo(VI) complex is a dual-functioning material: it enables optical
detection61f,61g of nanomolar Th4+ via the highly selective metal-ion displacement protocol and allows
extractive separation61h/enrichment of
Th4+ from aqueous solution.

Crystal Structure of the
M1 Complex
Figure 1 displays
the structure of the oxo-bridged dinuclear Mo(VI) complex (M1) along
with the co-crystallized L derived from SCXRD analysis (Table S1). L plays an important role in crystal
packing connecting hydrogen-bonded dimeric units, [Mo2O4(μ2-O)(CH3OH)2(L)]2, having methanol–oxo interactions (Figure 2). The intermolecular hydrogen
bonds exist between methanol, oxo center of M1, and two phenol −OH
centers of co-crystallized L, leading to an infinite chain of hydrogen-bonded
dimeric units, [Mo2O4(μ2-O)(CH3OH)2(L)]2···L···[Mo2O4(μ2-O)(CH3OH)2(L)]2 (Figure 2). Tables S3–S6 (Supporting Information) show selected bond lengths and angles. Consequently,
the MoO5N octahedron (methanol and one of the oxoterminal occupies axial positions) is highly distorted. Thus, trans-octahedral
angles (OMoO and OMoN) ranges from 160.67 to 162.78°, whereas
bond lengths ranges from ∼1.92Å (terminal oxo group) to
∼2.33Å (methanol). The two long bonds correspond to Mo–Oaqua and Mo–Nimine are trans-oxo groups to
terminal oxo groups. Each Mo(VI) center is bonded to one L (as chelating
N and O donors), one methanol, two terminal oxo groups, and a μ2-bridged oxo group that imposes Mo···Mo separation
∼3.57Å with Mo–O–Mo bridging angle, ∼141.45°.
This angle is significantly smaller than reported di-oxo-(μ-oxo)-Mo(VI)
dimers of monodentate ligands (Lmon), (151–171°).61 The difference in Mo–O–Mo angles
between [Mo2O4(μ2-O)Cl2(Lmono)4] and [Mo2O4(μ2-O)(CH3OH)2(L)] is notable
and may be due to higher degrees of freedom of the angles around Mo(VI)
centers for the former.

Results and Discussion
Spectroscopic
Studies
The spectroscopic properties
of the Mo(VI) complex (M1) and its optical recognition
of Th4+ have been thoroughly investigated. The methanol
solution of M1 is absorbed at 267 nm (ε = 2.7 ×
103 M–1 cm–1) and 362
nm (ε = 9.8 × 105 M–1 cm–1), assigned to π–π* and n−π*
electronic transitions, respectively.62,63 Upon addition
of Mo(VI) to L, a new band that appears at 481 nm (ε = 2.6 ×
104 M–1 cm–1) is assigned
as the L to Mo(VI) charge transfer (LMCT)64 process, whose effect is reflected in the crystal structure of M1.

The presence of nanomolar Th4+ affects
the absorption as well as steady-state emission spectra of M1, whereas other relevant cations (Mn+) viz. UO22+, Pr3+, Ce4+, Sn2+, Zr4+, Ga3+, Tl3+, In+, WO22+, La3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Er3+, Tb3+, Ho3+, Lu3+, Yb3+, Y3+, Mn2+, and their
mixture have no effect (λEx, 310 nm) (Figures 3 and 4). The effect of pH on the emission characteristics of M1 in the
presence and absence of Th4+ has directed us to perform
the entire studies at pH ∼7 (Figure S1).

Figure 3 Effect of common cations on the emission spectra of M1 (20 μM): 1-UO22+, 2-Pr3+,
3-Ce4+, 4-Sn2+, 5-Zr4+, 6-Ga3+, 7-Tl3+, 8-In+, 9-WO22+, 10-La3+, 11-Pr3+, 12-Nd3+, 13-Sm3+, 14-Eu3+, 15-Gd3+, 16-Er3+, 17-Tb3+, 18-Ho3+, 19-Lu3+, 20-Yb3+, 21-Y3+, and 22-Mn2+ (MeOH,
10 mM hydroxyethyl piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer, pH
5, λEx, 310 nm).

Figure 4 Effect of common cations on absorption spectra of M1 (20 μM). The media and ions are same as mentioned in Figure 3.

In the presence of Th4+, the green emission
of M1 (λEx = 310 nm, Figures 3 and S2) experiences
red shift to orange-red and its intensity increases up to 41-fold
with increasing amounts of Th4+ (Figure 3).

Plausible interference by relevant
cations (Mn+) during Th4+ sensing
is tested by competitive
experiments in two different ways. In the first case, the [M1–Th4+] system is titrated with different Mn+ (100 μM), whereas for the other,
the [M1–Mn+] mixture
is titrated with Th4+ (Figure S3). In the first case, the emission intensity remains unaltered, whereas
the emission intensity increased in the second case (Figure 3). The selectivity of M1 for Th4+ is further established by measuring
the emission intensity of M1 in a mixture containing
Th4+ along with various other metal ions (Figure S3). Thus, high selectivity of M1 for
Th4+ in the binary mixture as well as in the “multicomponent”
system is established.

Gradual addition of Th4+ lowers
the emission intensity
at 398 nm (λEx = 310 nm), whereas the intensity of
the new band at 557 nm (orange-red) gradually enhances (Figure 5) up to 41 (Φ = 0.72-,
4.5-fold). Moreover, the ratiometric response is associated with an
isoemissive point at 508 nm (Figure S2).
Moreover, the ratio, F557nm/F398nm also experiences 41-fold enhancement (from 0.02469
to 1.01267, Figure S4). The emission intensity
versus the [Th4+] plot is sigmoidal having a linear region
up to 0.97 μM Th4+ (Figure S5). The limit of detection (LOD) of M1 for Th4+ is 1.5
× 10–9 M (Figure S6).65 The corresponding displacement binding
constant is 4.59 × 106, calculated by applying the
Hill equation21 on fluorescence titration
data (Figure S7).66,67 On the other hand, the binding affinity of L for Th4+ calculated in a similar way is 3.17 × 105 (λEm = 525 nm; λEx = 338 nm). The LOD of L for
Th4+ is 8.6 × 10–8 M (Figure S8). Thus, the efficiency of M1 is higher
than L for optical recognition of Th4+.

mentioned (λEx = 310 nm).

The UV–vis spectrum of M1 displays an
intramolecular
CT transition at 481 nm. Gradual adding of Th4+ (0–3000
μM) lowers the absorbance of the 362 nm band (ε = 9.8
× 105 M–1 cm–1) with appearance of two new bands at 267 nm (ε = 9.6 ×
103 M–1 cm–1) and 485
nm (ε = 2.3 × 106 M–1 cm–1) involving two isosbestic points at 321 and 388 nm
(Figures 6 and S9).64 The plots of
absorbance of M1 versus added Th4+ at three different wavelengths
viz. 267, 362, and 485 nm are presented in Figure S9 (Supporting Information). The corresponding ratiometric
plots, viz. A485nm/A362nm (0.01543–5.96655) and A267nm/A362nm (2.0986–0.17126) versus
[Th4+] are presented in Figure S10 (Supporting Information).

Job’s plot68,69 from fluorescence titration data
indicates 1:1 (mole ratio) binding between Th4+ and M1
(Figure S11), corroborated by the electrospray
ionization MS (ESI-MS) spectrum of the resulting mixture (calcd m/z, 777.48; found, 777.52 for [M + Na]+).

Similarly, Job’s plot and the ESI-MS
spectrum reveal the
composition70,71 of the [Mo(VI)–L] complex
as 1:2 (mole ratio, Figures S11 and S28). In the presence of Th4+, green M1 turns orange-red
(under UV light) and pale yellow to orange-red (bare eye) (Figures 3 and 4).

The weak emission of L may nicely be rationalized
by DFT studies
that reveal its planar geometry (Figure S12), allowing the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process.69 Addition of Mo(VI) to L inhibits the PET through
initiation of CHEF, resulting weak green fluorescence (Scheme 1). On the other hand, addition
of Th4+ displaces Mo(VI) from the [L–Mo(VI)] complex
(M1) to form the [L–Th4+] complex (M2), whereby
green fluorescence turns orange-red (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Proposed Th4+sensing Mechanism
The interaction between L and
Th4+ is further supported
by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Upon addition of Th4+ to L, the phenol proton (−OH) at 12.82 ppm disappears indicating
deprotonation. Further, the imine proton (−CH=N–,
“b”) at 8.52 ppm splits into two downfield shifted peaks,
viz. 9.86 ppm (“d”) and 8.71 ppm (“c”)
(Figure S13).

The experimental molecular-ion
peak at 755.12 in the mass spectrum
of the [L–Th4+] adduct is very close to the calculated m/z, 755.25. The notable difference between
the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the [L–Th4+] adduct and L indicates the formation of the complex (Figure S14). All these support the CHEF process
involving L and Th4+, and obviously, CHEF occurs via inhibition
of the PET process.

Upon addition of Th4+ to M1,
the absorbance increases
at 362 nm (ε = 9.8 × 105 M–1 cm–1) and 485 nm (ε = 2.3 × 106 M–1 cm–1), attributed
to LMCT from L to Th4+ (Figure 6).

The FTIR spectrum of M2 (Figure S15)
displays ν(CH=N) at 1768 cm–1 while
the corresponding peak for M1 appears at 1615 cm–1. The new peak at 2245 cm–1 is due to −N=N–,
originated from delocalization of π-electrons involving the
hydrazone-N center. It is proposed that the dinuclear [L–Mo(VI)]
complex is transformed to the mononuclear [L–Th4+] complex. In consequence, π-electrons on the N-donor site
rearrange to form the −N=N– bond which is involved
in LMCT observed in M2. Besides, splitting of the 2017 cm–1 peak indicates involvement of the −NO3– group to form M2. Additionally, a new weak peak at 3486 cm–1 (−O–H stretching) indicates the presence of H2O in M2. The stretching at 2987 cm–1 in
solid-state FTIR spectra of M1 shifted to 2949 cm–1 in M2, indicating the interaction of the Mo(VI) complex with Th4+ (Figure S15). The −N–O–
stretching is found at 1380 cm–1 in the FTIR spectra
of M2.

To further establish the fact that Mo(VI) in M1 is displaced
by
Th4+ leading to M2, the energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence
(EDXRF) spectra of M1 and M2 are compared (Figure S16). For this purpose, M2 is collected from the reaction mixture
of M1 and Th4+ by partitioning between ethyl acetate and
water. However, the residue collected after removal of the organic
solvent is subjected to EDXRF, the aqueous layer is tested for Mo(VI).69c All of the results (Figures S16–S19) clearly establish the proposed sensing mechanism.

The 1H NMR titration in DMSO-d6 further strengthens the proposed interaction in solution
(Figure 7). Upon addition
of 2.0 equiv Mo(VI) to L, the imine proton (−CH=N, “b”)
at 8.52 ppm is downfield shifted to 9.66 ppm, indicating the interaction
of imine-N with Mo(VI). Moreover, the phenol proton (−OH) at
12.82 ppm disappears suggesting O-coordination via deprotonation (Figure 7).

Figure 7 1H NMR titration
of M1 with Th4+ in DMSO-d6.

On the other hand, upon addition
of 2.0 equiv Th4+ to
M1, the phenol proton [of L at 12.82 ppm that disappeared in presence
of Mo(VI)] does not reappear, suggesting involvement of phenol oxygen
to form the M2 complex (Figure 7). However, other aromatic ring protons do not change significantly,
except a small upfield shift, attributed to “through bond delocalization”
or “diamagnetic shielding” of the negatively charged
phenolate moiety. Interestingly, in the presence of 1.0 equiv Th4+, the imine proton (−CH=N–, “b”
for M1) at 9.66 ppm splits into two peaks (8.83 ppm, “c”
and 9.82 ppm, “d”), whose intensity increases with increasing
Th4+ concentration. This fact suggests “uncoordination”
of one imine-N (−CH=N–, “c”), corroborated
from the mass spectrum of the [M1 + Th4+] adduct (Figure S32). All these lead to propose the formation
of a mononuclear [L–Th4+] complex involving N and
O donors of L. Additionally, 1H NMR, FTIR, and mass spectra
of the isolated [Th(IV)–L] complex support its mononuclear
status.

Kinetics of Mo(VI) Displacement from M1 by Th4+
The kinetic studies have been performed72,73 at 362 nm by monitoring the change of absorbance of M1 as a function
of time on a stopped-flow spectrophotometer with varying amounts of
Th4+ (Figure S20). Immediately
after the pulse at 362 nm, a very rapid decay in absorbance is detected,
attributed to very fast displacement of Mo(VI) by Th4+.
Under the pseudo-first-order condition with respect to Th4+ in methanol, the absorbance remains unaltered just after ∼0.30
s. At the same time, a strong absorbance is observed at 485 nm associated
with an extinction coefficient, 2.3 × 106 M–1 cm–1. The rate constant of the displacement reaction
is ∼7.8 × 1010 M–1 s–1 (Figure S20).

Theoretical
Studies
The optimized geometry of M1 and M2 complexes has
been generated
using the correlation consistent cc-pVDZ basis set for C, N, H, and
O atoms in the gas phase. For Th4+, the Stuttgart relativistic
small-core effective core potentials and their companion basis sets
are used.74,75 A set of 8s7p6d4f/Th Gaussian basis functions
are employed for rest of the electrons (Figure S12). The highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) energy gap for optimized
M1 and M2 complexes are 0.09050 and 0.06742 eV, respectively,76 (Figure 8). Notably, DFT studies indicate ground-state CT from L to
Th4+ in the gas phase. It is observed that the energy of
both the HOMO and LUMO decreases in the Th4+ bound state
with an overall decrease of the HOMO– LUMO gap by 0.02308 eV
in M2 relative to M1. Moreover, the charge density at the LUMO of
M1 is distributed throughout the molecule. Upon excitation, the charge
density slightly shifted to the azine and Th4+ center.
After binding to Th4+, the CT becomes more prominent at
the vicinity of acceptors, azine bound to Th4+, observed
from the LUMO.

Figure 8 HOMO–LUMO energy gaps in M1 and M2.

As selectivity of the probe is highly solvent dependent,77 the emission characteristics of M1 in the presence
of Th4+ have been tested in different solvents viz., MeOH,
EtOH, dimethylformamide (DMF), CHCl3, CH3CN,
tetrahydrofuran (THF), EtOAc, dichloromethane (DCM), and dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). The sensitivity being highest in MeOH, entire studies
have been performed in MeOH.

To examine the reversibility78 of binding
between M1 and Th4+, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (200
μM) (λEx, 342 nm) is added to the mixture of
M1 (20 μM) and Th4+ (100 μM). Interestingly,
the emission intensity at 557 nm decreases, whereas it increases significantly
at 398 nm, demonstrating reversibility of the binding process.

The emission characteristic of M2 being solvent dependent,76 coordinating solvents shift the emission to
higher wavelength and lower the quantum yield (Table 1).

Table 1 Solvent-Dependent
Emission and Quantum
Yield of M2

DMSO	534	1.1	
MeOH	557	1.5

CHCl3	479	3.3	
DMF	548	0.8	
ACN	534	1.8	
EtOAc	539	2.6	
These observations in combination
with DFT results indicate that
the HOMO–LUMO energy gap (Eg) may
be tuned through variation of solvent polarity and excited-state stability
of the system. It is found that the excited state has higher dipole
moment in polar-aprotic/or polar-protic solvents than nonpolar aprotic
solvents. Moreover, the sensitivity depends strongly on the solvent
polarity.69 In noncoordinating solvents
like THF, CHCl3, and DCM, it emits at shorter wavelength
while coordinating solvents favor emission at relatively longer wavelength
with low quantum yield. In contrary, the absorption characteristic
of M2 remains almost unaffected. Figure 9 shows solvent-dependent emission spectra
and corresponding UV-light exposed colors of M2 (λEx = 310 nm).

Application
Analysis of Real Water Samples
The developed method
is applied for determination of Th4+ in real water samples
by the standard addition method.66−68 The accuracy of the
method is checked by recovery studies using different concentration
levels of Th4+ in the contaminated water. A known amount
of Th4+ (as nitrate salt) is added to the contaminated
water sample collected from Durgapur-Asansol Industrial area of West
Bengal (India). Total concentration of Th4+ is measured
using the developed method (Figure S21). Table 2 indicates the efficiency
of the developed method.

Solid-Phase Extractive Recovery of Th4+ Using Immobilized
M1
The immobilization of M1 on silica (100–200 mesh)
is achieved by following the literature procedure.79 The mixture of M1 (1.5 g) and silica (10.1 g) is refluxed
in methanol for 3 h. The solvent is removed under vacuum. The color
of silica-immobilized M1 becomes light yellow. A glass column (15
cm × 1 cm) is filled with immobilized M1 up to 12 mL bed volume
(Figure 10). Th4+ contaminated in real water is passed through the column
at a flow rate of 1 mL min–1.

Figure 10 Color of silica-immobilized
M1 after Th4+ sorption.

To establish that silica-immobilized M1 binds to Th4+, its FTIR spectra are measured before and after sorption of Th4+. Figure S22 (Supporting Information) shows a red shift of the −CH=N– stretching
from 1625 to 1990 cm–1 after sorption of Th4+. Moreover, the 1386 cm–1 band is red shifted
to 1436 cm–1. The absence of the 3219 cm–1 (−O–H) band supports Th4+ binding on silica-immobilized
M1.

Comparison of the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of
silica-immobilized M1 before and after sorption of Th4+ (Figure 11) indicates
micellial growth at the silica bead surface for later one,80 suggesting Th4+ sorption.

(Mn+) through the column filled with silica-immobilized
M1, the light yellow-colored bed turns orange-red suggesting Th4+ sorption. The sorbed Th4+ finally eluted with
the hexane–ethyl acetate mixture (1:9, v/v).

Solvent Extraction of Th4+
The solvent extraction82−85 of Th4+ from the mixture
of other relevant cations (Mn+) is carried
out using M1. Different solvents
like CH3COOC2H5, CHCl3, CCl4, and DCM have been checked. Different concentrations
of M1 (0.1 × 10–3, 0.3 × 10–3, 0.5 × 10–3, 1.0 × 10–3, and 1.5 × 10–3 M) are prepared and equilibrated
with the abovementioned mixture containing Th4+. The system
is allowed to equilibrate for 2 h at 298 K in an automatic shaker
equipped with a temperature regulator. Then, the organic layer is
separated and the concentration of Th4+ is measured using
the calibration graph (Figure 12). The distribution coefficient (D) is calculated from the equation, D = CM(org)/CM(aq), where CM(org) and CM(aq)
are concentrations of Th4+ in organic and aqueous phases,
respectively, after extraction. Table 4 indicates very high Th4+ extraction efficiency
of M1 over other cations in a competing environment at a wide pH range86−88 in ethyl acetate (Figures 13 and S23). Concentration of M2
in the organic phase is monitored from the emission intensity (λEm = 557 nm). Similarly, L also enables to extract Th4+ (82.56%) in EtOAc. However, M1 being a better extractor is used
for extraction of Th4+ ions (95.23%).

Conclusions
An azine-based Mo(VI) complex (M1) is explored
for selective detection
of Th(IV) through orange-red emission. Th(IV) quickly displaces Mo(VI)
from M1, resulting in red shift of the emission band and 41-fold fluorescence
enhancement. The LOD for Th(IV) is 1.5 × 10–9 M. The displacement binding constant of M1 for Th(IV) is 4.59 ×
106 M–1. However, the structure of M1
is confirmed by SCXRD, the recognition of Th(IV) by the displacement
approach using M1 is established firmly by spectroscopic studies and
kinetically followed by the stopped-flow technique. Moreover, M1 efficiently
extracts Th(IV) from aqueous solution to ethyl acetate. The silica-immobilized
M1 efficiently enriches Th(IV) from the mixture of other relevant
cations through solid-phase extraction. DFT studies support experimental
findings and reveal the energy parameters associated with the Th(IV)
recognition process.

Experimental Section
Materials and Equipment
HEPES buffer, 4-N,N-diethylamino
salicyaldehyde, and hydrazine hydrate
(98%) are procured from Sigma-Aldrich (India). Thorium(IV) nitrate
is bought from Merck (India). The spectroscopic grade solvents and
other analytical grade reagents purchased from Merck (India) are used
without further purification. Milli-Q Millipore (18.2 MΩ cm–1) water is used whenever required.

A Multispec
2450 spectrophotometer and Prestige 21 CE FTIR spectrometer are used
to measure respective spectra. A QTOF 60 Micro YA 263 mass spectrometer
is utilized to measure the mass spectrum in the ES positive mode.
The steady-state emission and excitation characteristics are monitored
with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter. The solution pH is measured
with a SYSTRONICS digital pH meter (model 335). The elemental analysis
is carried out using the Bruker ARTAX instrument in air. Kinetic experiment
is carried out with an Applied Photophysics SX 17MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer
(model OPT-622) in the symmetric mixing mode at 25 °C and ambient
pressure. A Bruker ADVANCE III HD (400 MHz) spectrometer is used to
record 1H NMR spectra. Chemical shifts are reported in
parts per million (ppm), and the residual solvent peak is used as
an internal reference: proton (chloroform δ 7.26), carbon (chloroform
δ 77.16), or tetramethyl silane (TMS δ 0.00) is used as
a reference. Multiplicity is indicated as follows: s (singlet), d
(doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), dd (doublet of
doublet), and bs (broad singlet). Coupling constants are reported
in Hertz (Hz). The SCXRD analysis of M1 is carried out at 150 K on
a Bruker SMART APEX CCD diffractometer using Mo Kα radiation
(λ = 0.71073 Å).
