Mono-
and bimetallic alloy Pt and Ru catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 have been investigated for the reduction of
pollutants (NOx, NH3, and CO)
generated during the continuous combustion of an aqueous urea ammonium
nitrate fuel. A Pt/Ru alloy with a Pt25/Ru75 atomic ratio has been
found to have higher activity and selectivity than those of a 50/50
alloy and monometallic catalysts. Among monometallic catalysts, Ru
was more selective toward N2 formation, whereas Pt showed
a higher selectivity toward NH3 formation. For Ru, it was
observed that the oxidizing atmosphere of NOx pollutants caused the formation of RuO2, whereas Ru in
the Pt/Ru alloy was stable under these conditions. Temperature (250–500
°C) and pressure (1–8 MPa) studies over Ru and 25/75 Pt/Ru
have concluded that the alloy catalyst at 400 °C and 5 MPa reduced
the pollutants to a minimum level with high yields of N2 (99.7%) and CO2 (99.9%). It was also observed that the
25/75 Pt/Ru catalyst remained stable up to 100 h of thermal treatment
at 400 °C. Minimal pollutants were obtained at a weight hourly
space velocity = 11 822 h–1. Characterization
studies of the spent catalyst showed that metal particles were sintered
over a period of time (8 h) and the γ-Al2O3 support was transformed into θ- and α-phases under the
hydrothermal reaction conditions.

1 Introduction
Fossil
fuels, formed during the course of hundreds of millions
of years, are fundamental building blocks of our civilization. Nevertheless,
their consumption at an ever rising rate has devastating effects on
the environment and climate. The extraction and combustion of fossil
fuels inevitably release tremendous amounts of CO2, NOx, and volatile organic compound particles and
other pollutants to the atmosphere. With increasing global greenhouse
gas emission, there is urgency to pursue all measures to develop and
deploy carbon-neutral energy technologies. Therefore, one of the most
significant scientific challenges that our society must address is
the development of a secure and sustainable energy economy. Hydrogen
is often considered as a promising environmentally friendly fuel,1 but it cannot become the direct energy coin due
to safety issues, low volumetric energy density, and costly infrastructure.2 A more favorable approach is to chemically store
hydrogen in the form of more condensed compounds such as chemical
fuels via carbon3,4 or nitrogen5,6 as
the main hydrogen carriers. The carbon-based economy is well-established;
however, the nitrogen-based analogue is not sufficiently studied.
In such an economy, nitrogen-based fuels can be used as means of energy
storage and production. Recently, a nitrogen-based fuel consisting
of an aqueous solution of ammonium nitrate (AN) with urea as a reducing
additive was suggested.7 The AN-based fuels
(e.g., urea ammonium nitrate (UAN)) are monofuels because they contain
the oxidizer (nitrate ion) as well as the reducer (ammonium ion and
urea) in the same solution. Consequently, no external oxidizer such
as atmospheric oxygen is required for their combustion. A recent study
of aqueous UAN fuels was reviewed elsewhere.8 These fuels are nontoxic, nonflammable, nonexplosive, and chemically
stable and hence safe to handle and transport.9 The aqueous UAN fuel has a volumetric energy density of 4.4 GJ m–3, which is equivalent to that of compressed natural
gas at 10 MPa. Hence, aqueous UAN may be suitable for stationary power
plant applications. The desired environmentally friendly combustion
of aqueous UAN (reaction R1) produces H2O, N2, and small amounts
of CO2. Noncatalytic steady-state experiments were carried
out to investigate the fuel combustion at several flow rates and working
pressures.8,10 It was observed that NOx emission (128 mg MJ–1) from a UAN fuel
at pressures above 15 MPa was lower than the regulation standard for
power generation. R1  Side reactions
may release pollutants during
UAN combustion such as nitrogen oxides (NO2, NO, and N2O) and CO, which can be a major cause for ozone depletion,
acid rain, greenhouse effect, and photochemical smog.11,12 Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas with a life time of 150 years
in the atmosphere and has a global warming potential (GPW) of 310
times that of CO2.13,14 Hence, further pollutant
abatement (e.g., NOx, NH3,
and CO) is required by a postcombustion catalytic process to ensure
a green fuel operation. Therefore, it is essential to develop advanced
technologies and seek better catalysts to guarantee low pollutant
emission during UAN fuel combustion.

Catalytic reduction of
NOx and CO on
supported metal catalysts is an active field.15−24 In some cases, during NOx conversion,
NH3 and N2O were found to form as undesirable
byproducts. A large variety of catalysts were studied for the decomposition
of N2O, including transition metals (Fe, Cu, Co, and Ni)
and noble metals (Pd, Ru, and Rh).25−40 These catalysts are supported on metal oxides (SiO2,
Al2O3, ZrO2, CaO, TiO2, CeO2, and Fe2O3), perovskites,
hydrotalcites, zeolites (ZSM-5, USY, BEA, and ferrierite), and mesoporous
materials (MCM-41 and SBA-15).25−40 The noble metals were preferred to other transition metals due to
their superior stability.41 Supported Ru
catalysts, especially Ru/γ-Al2O3, are
known as active catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of NOx42,43 because of their high activity
and selectivity toward N2 formation.44 However, Ru has the disadvantage of getting oxidized in
an oxidizing environment.45,46 Water also deactivates
Ru catalysts;47 however, the activity can
be restored at higher temperatures (>479 °C) by the desorption
of water from the active sites.38 Among
various formulations of catalysts including Pt, Ag, Pd, Au, Rh, Cu,
Ni, and Co, Pt-based catalysts showed an excellent performance for
NOx conversion to NH3 even
at low temperatures and were less selective to N2 formation.41,48,49 Unfortunately, these catalysts
had a narrow temperature operating window. Improving the catalyst
stability and selectivity toward NOx and
NH3 reduction requires the design of noble metal bimetallic
catalysts.

Bimetallic catalysts were widely preferred over monometallic
analogues
due to their dual functionality. It has been reported that a bimetallic
catalyst (PtRu/SiO2) improved the selectivity toward N2 formation. However, the Pt/Ru catalyst was used merely to
study NO reduction.50

One major drawback
in most of the studies mentioned above is that
the catalysts were tested using models, standard mixtures of pollutants
with known compositions. Hence, it becomes difficult to reproduce
these results in actual fuel combustion with a highly complex composition
compared to that of the model system.

The novelty in our work
is the study of catalyst performance in
a real system containing UAN postcombustion pollutants. The investigated
system includes a complex mixture of effluents, such as NOx, NH3, and CO, which has to be converted
into an environmentally friendly gas. It is very challenging to understand
the behavior of these mixtures of components in the presence of a
catalyst because they may exhibit a mutual interaction when reacting
with the catalyst site. In addition, this system is characterized
by high water content, which strongly influences the catalyst properties.
Bimetallic Pt/Ru catalysts are promising candidates for solving the
addressed problems. For support material, γ-Al2O3 was selected due to its high temperature stability and wear
resistance, along with a high surface area (∼200 m2 g–1). The aim of the presented work is to investigate
the activity of mono- and bimetallic Pt/Ru catalysts in the conversion
of NOx, CO, and NH3 pollutants
into H2O, N2, and CO2.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Ammonium
nitrate (≥99%,
Sigma-Aldrich), urea (≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), H2PtCl6 (8 wt % solution, Sigma-Aldrich), RuCl3·xH2O (Sigma-Aldrich), γ-Al2O3 pellets (1/8″, Alfa-Aesar), and Milli-Q
ultrapure water were used for fuel and catalyst preparation.

2.2 Combustion and Catalytic Experiments
Aqueous UAN combustion
was carried out in a continuous high-pressure
reactor (Scheme 1).
The fuel composition was as follows: 60% AN, 15% urea, and 25% water
by weight. The fuel was fed at a flow rate of 10 mL min–1 using a high-pressure pump (LC-20AP, Shimadzu) into a continuous
SS310 reactor (634 mm long, 60 mm internal diameter). The temperature
inside the reactor was monitored using a type-K thermocouple placed
in a sleeve inside the reactor. The reactor was heated using a three-zone
furnace (3210, Applied Test Systems) set to 550 °C at all zones.
The pressure inside the reactor was controlled by a Programmable Logic
Controller (PLC) via a pneumatic valve. The postcombustion catalyst
chamber (15 cm long, 9.4 mm I.D.) made up of SS316L was connected
in series with the outlet of the continuous reactor. The chamber was
heated by heating tapes at temperatures varying between 250 and 500
°C. The pollutant-containing gas effluent was passed through
the catalyst chamber packed with cylindrical pellets of catalysts.

Scheme 1 Experimental System Setup
The red sections indicate
the
heaters; TC, thermocouple; PT, pressure transducer; and FTIR, Fourier
transform infrared.

Mono- and bimetallic Pt/Ru
catalysts (2 wt %) were synthesized
by impregnation51 (Supporting Information, Section 1.1.). Catalysts in the form of pellets of either 2 wt %
Pt, Ru, Pt25Ru75, or Pt50Ru50 on γ-Al2O3 were placed in the chamber.
The catalyst amount was varied among 6.75 g (0.135 g metal), 3.375
g (0.016875 g metal), 1.6875 g (0.03375 g metal) and 0.84375 g (0.0675
g metal). Effluents from the catalyst chamber flowed through a pneumatic
valve and entered a heated gas receiver (11.5 L) at 180 °C, which
was kept at a constant pressure of 0.2 ± 0.01 MPa. The sampled
gas from the receiver was diluted by 99.995% N2 at 1:100
ratio using a gas dilution unit (M&C DIL-1/H). The diluted effluent
gas was analyzed using a multicomponent online Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) gas spectrometer (Gasmet CX-4000O2). The spectrometer
was calibrated using H2O, CO, CO2, NO, NO2, N2O, NH3, HNO3, and HNCO
references. The FTIR sampling frequency was ∼10 Hz with an
automatic averaging over 20 second segments. Subsequently, 15 consecutive
data points were averaged. The lowest detection limit for all gases
was 1–2 ppm.

Phase analysis via wide-angle X-ray diffraction
(XRD) was performed
for the bare supports and catalysts in the 2θ range of 5–90°
at 4° min–1.

Continuous combustion of
UAN fuel was conducted at various pressures
(1–8 MPa) with a constant fuel flow rate (10 mL min–1), to generate a steady gas output for the catalytic effluent abatement.
Catalytic experiments for the pollutant reduction were performed at
250–500 °C. Blank experiments were performed using γ-Al2O3 pellets. Mono- and bimetallic noble-metal-supported
catalysts, such as Pt/γ-Al2O3, Ru/γ-Al2O3, Pt25Ru75/γ-Al2O3, and Pt50Ru50/γ-Al2O3, were studied.

3 Results
and Discussion
Conversions, selectivity, and thermal and
mechanical stabilities
are the general parameters for the evaluation of supported metal catalysts.
It is well known that the activity of supported metal catalysts is
mainly dependent on the shape, size, distribution, and degree of agglomeration
of the metal particles on the support. The morphology and properties
of these catalysts were characterized before and after use. All of
the catalysts were calcined at 400 °C for 2 h in air and reduced
at 400 °C for 2 h in a 5% H2/N2 flow before
characterization and catalytic testing.

3.1 Characterization
of Mono- and Bimetallic Pt/Ru
Catalysts
Structural and morphological features of the catalysts
were characterized with XRD, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy
(HR-SEM), N2-sorption, and H2-chemisorption
analyses (Supporting Information, Section
1.2.) and correlated with the catalytic activity. Characteristic XRD
peaks for all of the metals and support are shown in the diffractograms
(Figure 1 and Figures S1–S4 in the Supporting Information).
In some cases, because of high dispersion, the metal peaks were not
clearly visible. After the reaction (8 h), the used catalysts were
dried at 120 °C for 2 h and characterized. For the pure Al2O3 support, the formation of a poorly crystallized
phase was evident from the broad peaks indexed for γ-Al2O3 in the obtained patterns (Figures S1–S4).

Figure 1 XRD patterns for (a) Pt/Al2O3, (b) Ru/Al2O3, (c) Pt25Ru75/Al2O3, and (d) Pt50Ru50/Al2O3 catalysts (Δ denotes
γ-Al2O3, ● denotes Ru).

The characteristic features of γ-Al2O3 (2θ = 37.3, 45.93, 66.81°) (JCPDS 75-0921)
can be noticed
in all samples of the studied mono- and bimetallic Pt and Ru catalysts.
The metallic phase of the active element (Pt or Ru) was confirmed
by XRD. The crystallite size of metal nanoparticles was calculated
using the Scherrer equation and was correlated with the size obtained
from H2 chemisorption and HR-SEM analyses (Table S2, Supporting information). It was observed
that in the fresh catalyst (Figure S1)
the Pt characteristic peaks were invisible (2θ = 39, 46, 67°)
(JCPDS No. 01-1190) but became visible after the reaction (Figure S1). This indicated that the Pt nanoparticles
grew during the reaction to 11 nm (calculated by the Scherrer equation).
Similarly, the Ru catalyst (2θ = 38, 44, 58, 69, 78.5, 84.8,
86°) (JCPDS No. 06-0663) particle size increased from 15 to 25
nm (Figure S2). In addition, the bimetallic
catalyst (Pt25Ru75) particle sizes of Pt and
Ru were found to increase to 14 and 46 nm, respectively (Figure S3). For monometallic Ru, it was observed
that after the reaction some of the Ru was converted to RuO2 (Figure S2) (2θ = 28, 39.6°)
(JCPDS No. 00-43-1027) because of the highly oxidizing NOx species. However, Ru in the bimetallic Pt/Ru catalyst
was not oxidized. Another observation was that the γ-Al2O3 support transformed into θ-Al2O3 (Figures S2 and S3) and
α-Al2O3 (Figure S3) because of the hydrothermal condition.52

The diffractogram of the fresh and used bimetallic Pt25Ru75 and Pt50Ru50 catalysts
does
not show a XRD peak corresponding to alloy formation. This implies
that the used bimetallic catalyst is either a disordered Pt/Ru alloy
or a two-phase system with Ru-rich and Pt-rich phases with a non-bcc
structure (common for alloy).50 Dispersion
and crystallite size of the fresh and spent catalysts were calculated
using H2-chemisorption analysis (Table S2, Supporting Information). For the Pt catalyst, the initial
crystallite size was found to be 3 nm, which increased to 10 nm after
the reaction, which is quite similar to XRD data. The dispersion of
the Pt catalyst also decreased from 38 to 10% during the course of
the reaction. For the Ru catalyst, the crystallite size was found
to decrease from 27 to 19 nm, which is against the trend observed
from XRD and HR-SEM. The dispersion changed from 3 to 5%.

For
Pt25Ru75, the crystallite size increased
from 2 to 18 nm, whereas for Pt50Ru50, it increased
from 4 to 18 nm, after the reaction. Hence, obviously, dispersion
of these catalysts reduced from 40 to 5% for Pt25Ru75 and from 24 to 5% for the Pt50Ru50 catalyst after the reaction (Table S2, Supporting Information).

The morphologies of fresh and spent
catalysts are shown in the
HR-SEM data (Figures 2 andS5–S8), where only Ru particles
were clearly visible in the fresh samples. The HR-SEM results were
generally in agreement with XRD and H2-chemisorption analyses
and support the fact that the metal particle size increased during
use of the catalysts. In the case of fresh Pt/Al2O3 and Pt25Ru75/Al2O3 catalysts, the nanoparticles were too small to be seen by HR-SEM
(Figures S5a and S7a). However, in the
spent catalysts, the particles’ size increased due to sintering,
making the particles sufficiently large to be seen (Figures S5b and S7b). In spent Pt/Al2O3 and spent Pt25Ru75/Al2O3, the particle size was 20 and 25–50 nm, respectively. For
Ru/Al2O3, the particle size range increased
from 11–20 to 25 nm. Similarly, for Pt50Ru50/Al2O3, the size increased from 20–25
to 25–50 nm (Figures S6 and S8).
N2-adsorption analysis determined the high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area of the Al2O3 support (208 m2 g–1), confirming its γ phase (Table S1). The lower surface area of the supported
catalysts (195–202 m2 g–1) is
due to the metal loading on the support (Table S1).

3.2 Evaluation of Catalytic Activity of Mono-
and Bimetallic Pt/Ru Catalysts
The catalytic activity of
mono- and bimetallic Pt and Ru catalysts for UAN combustion effluent
pollutant reduction was measured. Previous work on noncatalytic continuous
combustion of UAN showed that pollutant concentrations can be reduced
by increasing the pressure up to 15 MPa.53,54 At lower pressures, significant pollutant levels can exist in the
effluent stream. Therefore, a catalyst can help in reducing leftover
CO, NOx, and NH3 pollutants
in the effluent gas, especially at lower pressures. The complete noncatalytic
UAN combustion effluent composition as a function of pressure is provided
in the Supporting Information (Figure S9).

3.2.1 Activity of Pt Catalysts
Initially,
the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was tested because of
its expected activity and stability described elsewhere.41,55−57 In this work, the catalytic activity of Pt was studied
initially at 250 °C49,58 and pressures of 1,
2.5, and 5 MPa (Figure S10). The effluent
pollutant concentrations introduced into the catalysts changed with
the reactor combustion pressure. The Pt catalyst became active at
5 MPa, eliminating NO and CO, reducing the amounts of N2O (0.2 mmol ANmol–1) and NO2 (1.5 mmol
ANmol–1), and achieving a N2 yield of
96%. However, the concentration of NH3 increased from 37.4
to 108 mmol ANmol–1 following the catalytic process.
This behavior for Pt was also observed by other researchers.44,59,60 Our catalyst does not suffer
deactivation due to CO poisoning. In our case, H2 can be
possibly generated by the water gas shift reaction (WGS) of CO and
H2O (water vapor) present in the pollutant gas (R2). R2  Marcleod showed that Al2O3 support increases
the formation of NH3 in the presence
of NO, CO, and H2O.61 During
this step, hydrolysis of isocyanate groups (−NCO) also occurs,
which is a well-known route for NH3 formation.62 The −NCO group requires a catalytic site
for hydrolysis to happen (e.g. −Pt) (reactions R3–RR6) R3   R4   R5   R6  To reduce the NH3 effluent concentration
with Pt catalysts, we performed the reactions at 300 and 400 °C
at 5 MPa (Figure S11). At 300 °C,
there was no effect on the NH3 concentration, but there
was a slight decrease in N2O. At 400 °C, the NH3 concentration decreased from 108 to 11 mmol ANmol–1 and NO2 also decreased from 1.5 to 0.5 mmol ANmol–1. However, the NOx pollutants
increased. For example, NO and N2O increased from 0 to
13 mmol and from 0.2 to 7.9 mmol ANmol–1, respectively.
Therefore, monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are
not sufficiently effective in postcombustion reduction of UAN emission
levels.

3.2.2 Activities of Ru and Pt25Ru75 Catalysts
3.2.2.1 Effect of Temperature
According
to the literature, Ru/Al2O3 is more selective
to N2 formation compared with the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.43,50 The higher selectivity to N2 of the Ru catalyst in the steady-state reaction at a higher
temperature was correlated with a high coverage of the catalyst surface
with nitrogen- and oxygen-containing adsorbates, keeping the coverage
of adsorbed atomic hydrogen (H) low, thus suppressing the NH3 formation. In our system, atomic hydrogen was generated from NH3 (reducer) present in the fuel effluent mixture. With the
Ru/Al2O3 catalyst, we observed a drastic reduction
in the NH3 concentration from 45.8 mmol ANmol–1 (at 250 °C, 5 MPa) to 0.4 mmol ANmol–1 (at
400 °C, 5 MPa), consistent with the trend in the literature.
Hence, N2 formation was dominant over NH3 with
the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst.

Although Ru is
highly selective to N2 formation, it can be deactivated
by oxidation to RuO2 under the atmosphere of NOx pollutants. In an attempt to resolve this problem,
we prepared bimetallic Pt/Ru catalysts, hypothesizing that when the
two metals are intimately mixed, the oxidation resistance of Pt could
protect the Ru from getting oxidized. Compositions of Pt25Ru75/Al2O3 and Pt50Ru50/Al2O3 were selected for testing. The
reaction temperature and pressure were varied to evaluate the optimal
operating conditions of these catalysts. The Ru/Al2O3 and Pt25Ru75/Al2O3 catalysts were tested initially at 1 MPa and temperatures of 200
and 250 °C (Figure S12). Interestingly,
it was observed that even at 200 °C the Pt25Ru75 catalyst reduced the pollutants more efficiently compared
with Ru. For instance, the concentrations of pollutants over the bimetallic
catalyst (in mmol ANmol–1) were NO = 6.7, N2O = 7, CO = 0, and NH3 = 2.2 compared to those
over Ru, NO = 347, N2O = 11.8, CO = 30.5, and NH3 = 193.3. Both reduced the pollutant concentrations considerably
below those achieved without a catalyst (Figure S12).

To reduce pollutants further, tests were performed
at 250 °C,
which showed that Ru catalysts reduced the pollutants to even lower
values: NO = 8, N2O = 3.5, CO = 0, and NH3 =
1.2 mmol ANmol–1. The higher temperature also increased
the N2 yield from 79 to 99% for Ru. It was found that during
combustion at 1 MPa, the reaction of the larger amount of ammonia
and NOx effluent in the catalytic chamber
produced a large amount of heat. Consequently, the temperature difference
(ΔT) over the catalyst chamber was 240–280
°C. To avoid such large temperature variation across the catalyst
bed, further reactions with Pt25Ru75/Al2O3 at 1 MPa and higher temperatures were not performed.
Similar studies were performed with Ru and Pt25Ru75 catalysts at 2.5 MPa and temperatures of 250, 300, and 350 °C
(Figure S13). Unexpectedly, at 250 °C,
the Ru catalyst released a higher amount of NO and NH3 when
compared with reference, noncatalytic reactions (NO = 261.6 vs 156.2,
N2O = 1.5 vs 6.7, CO = 4.8 vs 12.1, NH3 = 154.8
vs 115.4 mmol ANmol–1). At 300 °C, there was
a slight improvement in the results in comparison to those at 250
°C (NO = 163.2, N2O = 7.4, CO = 6.9, NH3 = 116.1 mmol ANmol–1). When the catalyst temperature
was raised to 350 °C, there was a higher N2 yield
of 99.4% and the pollutants were reduced drastically (NO = 1.5, N2O = 6.1, CO = 0, NH3 = 0.8 mmol ANmol–1). Studies at higher temperatures with the Ru catalyst at 2.5 MPa
were not performed due to a temperature rise of 102 °C over the
catalyst. This would translate to an outlet temperature above 500
°C, damaging the experimental system. With the Pt25Ru75 catalyst (Figure S13),
there was not a significant effect on the pollutant concentrations
at 250 °C. However, at 300 °C, much smaller concentrations
of pollutants were emitted (NO = 0, N2O = 6.3, CO = 0,
NH3 = 1.1 mmol ANmol–1), with an improved
N2 yield of 99.5%. Increasing the temperature to 350 °C
led to higher pollutant concentrations (NO2 = 0.2, NO =
4.3, N2O = 8.6, CO = 0, NH3 = 4 mmol ANmol–1); hence, studies at higher temperatures were not
conducted.

The Pt25Ru75 catalyst facilitated
low pollutant
concentrations at 50 °C lower than the other catalysts, reducing
high-temperature damage to the catalyst and equipment. It is worth
noting that NO2 measurements were close to zero at all
tests performed at P = 1–2.5 MPa and were
therefore omitted from the text (the data can be viewed in Figures S12a and S13a).

On the basis of
our previous experience,8 the most optimized
noncatalytic reaction pressures for UAN combustion
with minimal pollutant emission were 15–25 MPa. The challenge
is to obtain such low pollution concentrations at lower pressures,
which will greatly simplify the reactor design. In our blank experiments,
at 5 MPa (without catalyst), we observed the following pollutant emission
(in mmol ANmol–1) at an N2 yield of 95.9%:
NO2 = 0.9, NO = 69.2, N2O = 0.3, CO = 3.3, and
NH3 = 37.4. Tests were performed with Ru and Pt25Ru75 as postcombustion catalysts at T = 250–500 °C (Figures 3 and 4). For the Ru catalyst,
at 250 °C, the pollutant levels were not reduced much (NO2 = 0.2, NO = 92.9, N2O = 0, CO = 0.3, NH3 = 45.8 mmol ANmol–1) compared to those in the noncatalytic
experiments. In fact, with the Ru catalyst, the concentrations of
NO and NH3 increased relative to those in the blank experiments.
At 300 °C, NO2, NO, and NH3 were converted,
whereas N2O and CO were generated (NO2 = 1.5,
NO = 52.8, N2O = 1.4, CO = 1.8, NH3 = 37 mmol
ANmol–1). At 350 °C, CO and NO2 were
converted and NO, N2O, and NH3 were generated
(NO2 = 1, NO = 59, N2O = 4.9, CO = 0, NH3 = 40.8 mmol ANmol–1). The final temperature
studied for the Ru catalyst at 5 MPa was 400 °C, which was found
to be optimal for pollutant emission (NO2 = 0.2, NO = 0,
N2O = 5, CO = 0, NH3 = 0.5 mmol ANmol–1). Unfortunately, N2O is a relatively stable compound,
as it decomposes at about 800 °C.63 According to the literature, a catalyst (Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/MgO) can help reducing N2O at 600 °C
in the presence of H2.43 However,
it is also reported that the catalytic activities of the Ru/Al2O3 catalysts decrease with time and the conversion
of N2O is linearly dependent on the amount of metallic
Ru.64 In our studies, we observed that
the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was undergoing oxidation
to RuO2 during the reaction, suppressing the activity of
the catalyst to convert N2O into N2. Literature
reviews show that the presence of moisture and oxygen in the feed
stream can also slightly decrease the Ru catalyst activity, probably
due to the competitive adsorption between these species with N2O on the catalytic sites.32 Similar
to this case, in our system, the catalyst is subjected to an oxidizing
environment and excess of H2O during the reaction. Therefore,
even higher temperatures of 500 °C did not promote N2O to N2 conversion significantly. Hence, for the Ru catalyst,
400 °C and 5 MPa were the best conditions to reduce the pollutant
levels.

reactions at P = 5 MPa, T = 200–500
°C, and WHSV = 5911 h–1.

Figure 4 N2 yield in the following: noncatalytic combustion,
over Ru, and over Pt25Ru75 catalysts at T = 200–500 °C and P = 5 MPa.

A similar temperature study was
performed for the Pt25Ru75 catalyst. As shown
in Figure 3, at 250
°C, the pollutant levels (in
mmol ANmol–1) were below the noncatalytic results
(NO2 = 0.5, NO = 25.1, N2O = 4.8, CO = 0, NH3 = 20.8). However, at 300 °C, the pollutant levels were
higher than those at 250 °C (NO2 = 0.7, NO = 35.3,
N2O = 11.5, CO = 0, NH3 = 31.3). A further increase
in temperature to 350 °C reduced the pollutants drastically (NO2 = 0.2, NO = 0.9, N2O = 5.1, CO = 0, NH3 = 1.5). The optimal condition for the Pt25Ru75 catalyst was 400 °C (NO2 = 0.2, NO = 0.3, N2O = 3.5, CO = 0, NH3 = 0.2 mmol ANmol–1), with a N2 yield of 99.7% (Figure 4). To completely eliminate the pollutants,
tests at temperatures of 450 °C (NO2 = 0.2, NO = 1.7,
N2O = 3.3, CO = 0, NH3 = 0) and 500 °C
(NO2 = 0, NO = 3.3, N2O = 2.3, CO = 0.4, NH3 = 0.5) were also conducted. However, the NOx, NH3, and CO levels started to rise with increased
temperature. The above temperature studies at different pressures
with Ru and Pt25Ru75 catalysts concluded that
the bimetallic Pt25Ru75 catalyst is preferable
at 400 °C and 5 MPa.

3.2.2.2 Effect
of Catalyst Content and TOF Calculation
Additional experiments
were performed to find the minimal amount
of catalyst required to achieve the lowest pollutant levels (Figure S14). We performed the tests with catalyst
(active metal) weights equal to 0.0675, 0.03375, and 0.016875 g, which
are exactly 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 the weight of the catalyst used in the
above reactions (0.135 g). This way, the WHSV value was actually increased
by sequent factors of 2. It was observed that the minimum amount of
pollutants in mmol ANmol–1 (NO2 = 0,
NO = 0.3, N2O = 3.5, CO = 0, NH3 = 0.5 at a
N2 yield = 99.5%) could be achieved with 1/2 of the catalyst
weight (0.0675 g) used in the previous tests. Further lowering the
catalyst quantity (equivalent to increasing WHSV) led to a decrease
in the conversion activity of the catalyst. Hence, a catalyst amount
of 0.0675 g (active metal), with a WHSV = 1182 h–1, was used in further studies with the Pt25Ru75 catalyst.

The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated for
both mono- and bimetallic Pt/Ru catalysts (Table S3, Supporting Information). It was calculated at T = 400 °C and P = 5 MPa by considering the
total moles of the reactants (NO, NO2, NH3,
and CO). Nitrous oxide was neglected from the calculation because
it was formed, rather than converted by these catalysts. The TOF was
found to be in the order Ru > Pt50Ru50 >
Pt
> Pt25Ru75. It was observed that the total
number
of pollutant moles converted is similar for all of the catalysts (0.09–0.11
mol ANmol–1). Thus, the TOF depended mainly on the
dispersion of these catalysts (Table S3).

3.2.2.3 Effect of Pressure
A pressure
study was performed using the Pt25Ru75 catalyst
(0.0675 g) at a pressure range of 1–7.5 MPa and a temperature
of 400 °C (Figure S15). At 5 MPa and
400 °C, the pollutant levels (in mmol ANmol–1) were as follows: NO2 = 0, NO = 0.3, N2O =
3.5, CO = 0, and NH3 = 0.5. Raising the pressure to 7.5
MPa increased most of the pollutant levels (NO2 = 0.1,
NO = 1.5, CO = 0, NH3 = 0.7), whereas only N2O decreased from 3.5 to 2.6 mol ANmol−1.

3.2.2.4 Effect of Pt/Ru Atomic Ratio
Catalytic pollutant abatement
was additionally conducted with a higher-Pt-content
bimetallic catalyst (Figure S16). A Pt50Ru50 catalyst was prepared to compare its activity
to that of Pt25Ru75 at 400 °C at 5 MPa.
This catalyst showed excellent activity in reducing the CO and NO2 levels. However, the emission of NO2, NO, and
NH3 was slightly higher than that obtained with the Pt25Ru75 catalyst. Hence, a bimetallic catalyst with
the Pt25Ru75 atomic ratio was preferred in our
studies.

3.2.2.5 Catalyst Stability
The stability
of the Pt25Ru75 catalyst was tested by heating
a spent catalyst to 400 °C for 100 h under N2 flow.
After this treatment, the catalyst was used again to treat the effluent
combustion gases at 400 °C and 5 MPa. We found that the catalyst
was completely stable and retained its original activity even after
this prolonged thermal treatment.

Overall, using bimetallic
Pt25Ru75/Al2O3 catalysts
at the optimal conditions (T = 400 °C, P = 5 MPa, WHSV = 11 822 h–1) reduced
the levels of NO, CO, and NH3 by 99, 100, and 99%, respectively.
Monometallic Pt and Ru and even bimetallic PtRu catalysts were unable
to completely eliminate the NH3 and N2O generated
during UAN fuel combustion. Instead of using these catalysts individually,
it may be more productive to use a one-pot catalyst reactor with a
ternary mixture of Pt, Ru, and Pt25Ru75 catalysts
arranged in series for complete catalytic decomposition of NH3 and N2O. A Ru catalyst plug can reduce most of
the pollutants except N2O. The next plug could be a Pt
catalyst, which can convert the N2O to NH3.
Finally, a third plug with a Pt/Ru bimetallic catalyst could convert
the generated NH3 into N2.

Future studies
can be extended to using other noble metals (e.g.,
Rh16,65,66 and Pd58). Furthermore, to improve the catalyst stability,
either supports like zeolites67 or additives
such as Ba, La, Si, Li, or K67 can be used
to increase the thermal stability of the Al2O3 support.

4 Summary
The central
theme of this project is that the UAN fuel can serve
as a future state-of-the-art energy storage and energy carrier material.
However, to become such a candidate, it must be a clean-burning and
nonpolluting fuel.

In summary, the catalytic activity, selectivity,
and stability
of mono- and bimetallic Pt/Ru-based catalysts were demonstrated for
the pollutant abatement of the UAN fuel postcombustion effluent. The
novelty in our work is the study of catalyst performance in a real
system with a complex mixture of effluents such as NOx, NH3, and CO. We have synthesized mono-
and bimetallic Pt and Ru catalysts by impregnation on a γ-Al2O3 support. The monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst reduced the levels of NO2, NO, N2O, and CO and showed higher selectivity toward NH3 than N2 formation. On the other hand, the monometallic
Ru/Al2O3 catalyst reduced pollutants, such as
NO2, NO, CO, and NH3, but was unable to decrease
the N2O sufficiently by converting it into N2. The multifunctionality of the bimetallic Pt25Ru75 catalyst enabled higher activity and selectivity compared
to those of Pt, Ru, and Pt50Ru50 catalysts.
Temperature (250–500 °C) and pressure (1–7.5 MPa)
studies concluded that the bimetallic Pt25Ru75 catalyst at 400 °C and 5 MPa (WHSV = 11 822 h–1) reduced the pollutants to a minimal level, with a high yield of
N2 (99.7%) and CO2 (99.9%). This study clearly
demonstrates that Pt is more selective toward NH3 formation,
whereas Ru is more selective toward N2 formation. The Ru
species were partially oxidized under the reaction’s oxidizing
atmosphere. However, the active species of the Pt25Ru75 catalyst were highly stable under the reaction conditions.
The γ-Al2O3 support phase transformed
into the θ-phase and α-phase due to the large steam content
in the effluent gas.

The previous catalytic studies on pollutant
reduction were mainly
focused on individual components. Our work is indeed significantly
more general using a complex mixture of real effluents (NOx, NH3, CO) from UAN combustion because
these pollutants can have mutual effects on each other in the presence
of a catalyst. Until now, the reduction of pollutants (NOx, NH3, CO) formed during combustion of
nitrogen-based fuels was achievable only at pressures above 15 MPa.
The addition of a postcombustion catalyst reduced the NOx, NH3, and CO emission even further, giving
rise to much lower emission (99–100% reduction) at a considerably
lower pressure (5 MPa). Use of bimetallic Pt25Ru75 catalysts at lower pressures along with an improved reactor design
will reduce the capital cost of future reactors. Therefore, this work
opens new opportunities and a new frontier for UAN high-pressure postcombustion
catalyzed pollution abatement.
