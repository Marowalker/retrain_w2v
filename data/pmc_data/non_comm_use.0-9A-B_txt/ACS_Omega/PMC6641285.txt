A general method,
focusing upon olefin metathesis, was developed
for the recovery of homogeneous olefin metathesis catalysts from crude
reaction solutions. This method utilizes the supramolecular host–guest
interaction between an azobenzene-modified N-heterocyclic
carbene ligand and a silica-grafted β-cyclodextrin to remove
homogeneous catalyst in a heterogeneous manner, allowing for the recovery
of more than 97% of ruthenium in solution. The robust and simple nature
of the guest molecule allows for the application of this method to
a wide range of homogeneous catalysts. This study reports the synthesis
and characterization of the said precatalyst and host compound as
well as proof-of-concept recovery trials for a number of common substrates,
with the residual ruthenium content of reaction mixtures evaluated
by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.

Introduction
Olefin metathesis has
become an irreplaceable reaction in the toolbox
of the organic chemist due to the ease with which a large variety
of olefin-containing small molecules and polymers can be synthesized.1 Arguably, the most significant breakthrough in
the area of ruthenium-based olefin metathesis was the discovery by
Grubbs and co-workers of the stable benzylidene species 1 in 1995 (Figure 1),2 which has come to be known as Grubbs’
first-generation catalyst. This ruthenium-based catalyst was an improvement
over other tungsten- and molybdenum-based metathesis catalysts at
that time owing to its increased functional group tolerance and improved
stability toward atmospheric oxygen and moisture. The addition of
a neutral N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand yielded
Grubbs’ second-generation catalyst (2),3 providing an increased stability of the catalyst,
thanks to the enhanced stability of the carbene–Ru bond. The
reactivity of this catalyst was also an improvement over its predecessors,
proving to be on par with several highly active molybdenum metathesis
catalysts. Yet another important discovery was made by Hoveyda in
1998,4 replacing the benzylidene moiety
with an o-isopropoxybenzylidene group (3),5 improving the stability of the precatalyst
even further.

the
subject of this work (4).

As the methods for performing metathesis transformations
have increased,
a great deal of effort has been applied to the design of catalysts
with increased lifetime and functionality. In this vein, the design
of catalysts that can be recovered and recycled has received increased
attention over the past several years.6 The most common method toward this goal involves modification of
the stable NHC ligand to achieve a variety of effects. Previous work
has seen the creation of heterogeneous catalysts by immobilization
of the catalyst moiety onto a solid support by way of the NHC,7,8 often using silica gel or polymer beads, though not exclusively.
Although these catalysts often show high recovery rates, they suffer
in efficiency due to the decreased mobility of the catalyst in solution.

Homogeneous metathesis catalysts have also been prepared with the
goal of recovery, again by modification of the NHC structure. A few
of the reported examples include the synthesis of soluble polyisobutylene-supported
catalysts or those with thermomorphic polymer moieties in the ligand
structure,9 as well as the inclusion of
quaternary ammonium functional groups, which allow for biphasic recovery
methods or simple filtration through silica gel.10 These catalysts tend to perform better than their heterogeneous
counterparts; however, they often do not reach the level of efficiency
of the original Grubbs’ and Hoveyda–Grubbs’ species,
and the recovery of these catalysts is seldom as effective.

Azobenzenes are an extensively studied group of molecules, which
exist primarily as the more stable trans isomer under normal conditions
but undergo cis and trans photoisomerizations when subjected to ultraviolet
and visible light, respectively. This isomerization is instantaneous
and reversible and has been applied to a variety of materials systems
with great success.11 In the presence of
β-cyclodextrin (BCD), a seven-membered macrocyclic polysaccharide,
a differential host–guest complex forms.12 The trans form of azobenzene binds strongly to the hydrophobic
inner cavity of BCD, with typical association constants of 2.5 ×
103 M–1, whereas the cis form shows almost
no affinity for BCD.13

The precedent
provided by olefin metathesis, a well-studied area
of research, in addition to the relative ease in working with the
Hoveyda–Grubbs’-type catalysts, led us to choose olefin
metathesis as the initial focus for our efforts involving catalyst
recovery. This ongoing effort in our lab is geared toward utilizing
supramolecular interactions for the efficient recycling of transition-metal
catalysts, and herein, we describe the synthesis of a ruthenium-based
olefin metathesis precatalyst that aspires to take advantage of the
homogeneous reaction efficiency and heterogeneous levels of recovery.
The linchpin of this method is the interaction between azobenzene
and BCD-modified silica gel, which can be isolated from the reaction
solution by a simple filtration. Additionally, by modifying the catalyst
structure only minimally, the catalyst will retain the high level
of efficiency that is expected for this ubiquitous class of chemical
reactions. To our knowledge, the only other example of supramolecular
host–guest interactions applied to the study of catalyst recovery
utilized adamantane as the guest moiety,14 and we hypothesize that leveraging the reversible cis/trans photoisomerization
of azobenzene will result in a more functional recovery system.

Results
and Discussion
The synthesis and study of stable NHC compounds
has seen an explosion
of research since the discovery of the first stable carbene complex
by Arduengo.15 Several different synthetic
pathways have emerged since that time, allowing for the synthesis
of a seemingly endless array of varying NHC structures.6a Our proposed ruthenium-based catalyst is only
minimally modified from the standard Hoveyda–Grubbs’
second-generation catalyst and was synthesized via the biselectrophilic
pathway according to Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Azobenzene-Containing NHC Ligand and
Subsequent Precatalyst 4
The synthesis of precatalyst 4 began with
the alkylation
of 4-phenylazophenol 5, followed by dibromination of
the terminal alkene to produce dibromide 7, our biselectrophile
intermediate. Substitution under high-temperature conditions with
2,4,6-trimethylaniline, followed by careful workup, resulted in diamine 8 in acceptable yield. The treatment of the resulting diamine
with triethyl orthoformate and ammonium tetrafluoroborate resulted
in the precipitation of the cyclized NHC precursor salt 9. Subsequent efforts to generate the desired precatalyst directly
using strong bases, such as potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide and
potassium tert-butoxide, were unsuccessful under
all conditions due to the short lifetime of the resulting carbene
(see Supporting Information for details).
An indirect route toward the catalyst was ultimately successful involving
the formation of an intermediate chloroform adduct 10 under basic conditions. Thermolysis of the chloroform adduct in
the presence of the Hoveyda–Grubbs’ first-generation
catalyst resulted in the formation of the desired precatalyst 4, which was isolated easily as a green/yellow band on a silica
gel column.

The synthesis of our desired host compound was adopted
from several
sources16 and is depicted in Scheme 2. Our synthetic route began
with the monotosylation of commercially available BCD using p-toluenesulfonylimidazole, which was then substituted with
sodium azide to afford mono-6-azido-6-deoxy-β-cyclodextrin 13. Reductive amination of this compound resulted in a monoamino-BCD
compound that was entirely insoluble in all common metathesis solvents,
requiring a different method to be adopted. To this end, compound 13 was permethylated (PM) to yield the monoazido-PM-BCD compound 14 in excellent yield after purification by column chromatography.
A Staudinger reaction with this compound yields the monoamino-PM-BCD
compound 15. The treatment of this compound with activated
silica that had been previously functionalized with isothiocyano groups
(17) resulted in the desired host complex 18, joining cyclodextrin to the silica support via a thiourea linkage.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Silica-Grafted BCD, the Desired Host Compound
The characterization of compound 18 by Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) illustrates the successful creation of our host (Figure 2). The broad peaks
at approximately 3450 cm–1 are assigned to O–H
stretching vibrations present in either unaltered BCD or on the surface
of the silica gel. The IR spectra of PM compounds 14 and 15 show no such peak, indicating that the observed O–H
stretching peaks in our host compound are due solely to those present
on the surface of silica. The sharper peaks at 2950 cm–1 are assigned to the C–H stretching frequencies of PM-BCD.
Additionally, the strong and broad peaks at approximately 1075 cm–1 in the spectra of the host compound and silica are
assigned to Si–O stretching vibrations. The combination of
these data suggests the completion of our desired host compound.

spectra of (top to bottom) isocyanate 16, host
compound 18, activated SiO2, and BCD 11.

Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was applied to host compound 18 in an effort to
quantify the degree of functionalization
of the surface of the silica gel with PM-BCD (Figure 3).
Silica gel itself shows a loss of about 5% before 200 °C, likely
due to the presence of adsorbed water on the surface of the silica.
A further 6% of weight loss is attributed to the dehydration of surface
hydroxyl groups on silica. The host compound shows water loss at about
3–4% before dropping sharply in weight between 220 and 600
°C. This steep drop in weight is expected due to the thermal
decomposition of PM-BCD moieties. This provides a direct evidence
of the grafting of PM-BCD units onto the silica gel, with a concentration
of 1.43 × 10–4 mmol PM-BCD mg–118, a value in line with similar systems,11 which was used later in calculating reaction
stoichiometry.

(blue, dotted).

A visual proof-of-concept
experiment was performed using our newly
synthesized host and guest compounds to test our hypothesis that the
homogeneous catalyst can effectively be removed from solution via
host–guest complexation (Figure 4). A vial containing 1 mg of 4 in 1 mL
of dry and degassed toluene was stirred with 2 equiv of host complex 18, based upon the surface coverage of the PM-BCD calculated
above. After 15 min of stirring, the contents were allowed to settle.
Quickly, the silica-supported host complex settled out as a dark solid,
leaving the previously golden-brown solution a much lighter yellow
(Figure 4b). Filtering
this solution through a filter paper yielded a dark solid, distinct
from both the white host compound and the dark yellow-green catalyst,
supporting our initial hypothesis about this recovery method (Figure 4c).

Catalyst 4 is
easily soluble; however, silica-bound 18 is insoluble.
(b) After stirring is stopped, the host–guest complex 18:4 settles out of solution. (c) Visual comparison
of catalyst 4, host compound 18, and host–guest
complex 18:4.

Verifying the efficiency of catalyst 4 became
our
next goal, our hypothesis being that the addition of an azobenzene
moiety to the NHC backbone should not significantly affect catalyst
activity. For this experiment, two benchmark ring-closing metathesis
(RCM) substrates were chosen, and the efficiency of 4 was compared to that of the Hoveyda–Grubbs’ second-generation
catalyst 3 (Figure 5). The RCM reactions were carried out in DCM at 40
°C under typical metathesis concentrations, and the reactions
were monitored by gas chromatography (GC) using mesitylene as an internal
standard. In the reaction of diethyl diallylmalonate (19), our developed catalyst performed comparably to 3,
reaching >90% conversion in 30 min.

Figure 5 RCM conversion analysis
of 3 vs 4 on
two common substrates. Reactions were conducted in DCM (0.1 M) at
40 °C with 1 mol % catalyst and analyzed by GC with mesitylene
as an internal standard.

The evaluation of the catalytic efficiency of 4 was
then extended to the more hindered diene 21 (Figure 5). As expected, the
reaction was more sluggish for both catalysts involved, with the Hoveyda–Grubbs’
second-generation catalyst requiring 30 min to achieve greater than
90% conversion, and full conversion took 3 h. Catalyst 4 performed adequately, though proving to be slightly less efficient
than 3, achieving only 80% conversion after 30 min and
86% conversion after 5 h. Even more hindered substrates, such as diethyl
di(2-methylallyl)malonate (23), showed a very low conversion
for both catalysts even after 5 h, indicating that catalyst 4 compares quite well overall with other commercially available
metathesis catalysts.

Having shown that catalyst 4 is an efficient olefin
metathesis catalyst and that our designed host–guest system
is capable of separating homogeneous catalysts from solution, our
focus became set on testing the efficiency of catalyst recovery. This
goal was achieved by performing a substrate screen using several well-known
metathesis substrates (Table 1). These reactions were run under optimized conditions, using
1 mol % of 4, with dry and degassed toluene as a solvent,
at 60 °C for 30 min before analysis of the crude reaction mixture
by 1H NMR spectroscopy. It should be noted that under these
conditions, the performance of 4 was much improved, with
trisubstituted olefin 22 produced in full conversion
in less than 10 min. Tetrasubstituted olefins, however, still were
produced quite sluggishly with both 3 and 4, yielding only 12% conversion after 30 min. Other RCM substrates
performed well, including those producing seven-membered rings (29) and heterocycles (25, 27). Cross
metathesis of allyl acetate (31) and ene-yne metathesis
(33) was also shown to be effective under the present
conditions.

The
manner of recovery was examined by varying the amount of host
and number of recovery cycles performed. In this manner, after RCM
of 19, host 18 was added in one portion
and stirred at room temperature for 15 min. During this time, the
reaction vessel was irradiated for brief intervals with a 500 W halogen
work lamp to ensure that only the trans form of azobenzene was present
in solution. The contents of the reaction vessel were filtered with
the host–guest complex (18:4) separated
from the solution onto a filter paper. The residual ruthenium content
of the reaction solution was evaluated by ICP-MS analysis and displayed
in parts per million, defined as micrograms of ruthenium per gram
of product.6a In this way, it was shown
that treating the crude reaction mixture twice using 2 equiv of 18 (2 × 2 equiv) was more effective than treating it
only once with 6 equiv of 18 (1 × 6 equiv), with
residual ruthenium contents of 136 and 420 ppm, respectively. Extensive
treatment with 18, a 6 × 2 equiv method, resulted
in only 57 ppm remaining ruthenium, although this additional recovery
may not justify the amount of time and the host compound consumed
in the process. Additionally, it was found that increasing the stirring
time from 15 to 60 min upon addition of 18 (2 ×
2 equiv) did not increase the amount of ruthenium recovered from solution,
with both experiments yielding 136 ppm ruthenium, indicating that
complexation occurs rapidly. After these initial experiments were
performed with 19, all other substrates and a blank sample
were treated with 2 × 2 equiv host compound 18,
and the results are displayed in Table 1. The amount of residual ruthenium after recovery by
the host compound varied from 752 ppm to as low as 52 ppm, although
all examples were greatly reduced from the starting ruthenium concentration,
calculated to be 4772 ppm. The blank sample showed essentially 0 ppm
ruthenium. It should be noted
that these results were gained simply by a vacuum filtration of the
crude reaction mixture and that centrifugation and other advanced
separation techniques did not improve the result.

These data
lend credence to our hypothesis that host–guest
chemistry can be used to effectively recover catalysts from reaction
solution, although there is still room for the system to improve to
compete with other recovery methods in the literature. The benchmark
example of heterogeneous recovery methods, for example, is the Grubbs’
group’s use of a silica-grafted olefin metathesis catalyst,
which showed ruthenium levels as low as 5 ppb in treated reaction
solutions, although these systems, as stated before, were somewhat
less efficient than homogeneous reaction conditions.7d The method developed by the Kim group for purification
of metathesis reaction products saw residual ruthenium levels between
12 and 106 ppm (0.53 and 0.06 μg of Ru/5 mg of product in the
original manuscript) for homogenous reaction conditions.17 The Bergbreiter group showed residual ruthenium
levels of about 35 ppm (calculated from the reported9b <0.3% residual ruthenium level by ICP-MS) in their system
involving the use of a metathesis catalyst supported by a thermomorphic
polyethylene polymer. Finally, the aforementioned host–guest
system for the recovery of palladium(II) catalysts14 describe a “catch efficiency” of 82% when
host and guest are combined in solution; however, no details of residual
palladium levels are given for any reaction products. As this represents,
to our knowledge, the only other example of host–guest interactions
utilized for the recovery of transition-metal catalysts in solution,
we believe that our results represent a step forward for this technology,
although further work must be done to improve the efficiency of the
system. Improvements in both catalyst design and optimization of the
host system are currently underway in our laboratory. The utilization
of the reversible cis/trans photoisomerization of azobenzene for catalyst
recycling represents the ultimate goal of this line of our research.

Conclusions
A previously unreported NHC ligand for ruthenium-based olefin metathesis
catalysts was synthesized, bearing an azobenzene tag on the backbone
of the NHC ligand. This slight structural modification was designed
with the purpose of recovery of homogeneous catalyst from reaction
solutions using silica grafted with BCD moieties, with which azobenzene
forms a well-studied host–guest complex. This interaction was
found to occur efficiently in common metathesis solvents after permethylation
of BCD. The resulting catalyst performs comparably well with commercially
available metathesis catalysts and was therefore tested against a
number of common metathesis substrates. The levels of residual ruthenium
in solution after recovery were found to be as low as 52 ppm, which
shows promise for this method of recovery, although the average concentration
of residual ruthenium must still be improved. This work represents
the first piece of a larger effort on our part to utilize supramolecular
interactions for the recovery of transition-metal catalysts from solution,
an area of study that is relatively unreported in the literature.
Additional work already underway toward this goal involves improving
the recovery rate of ruthenium by catalyst design as well as enabling
the recycling of the recovered catalyst in subsequent olefin metathesis
reactions by taking advantage of the reversible cis/trans photoisomerization
of azobenzene. Most importantly, this work represents a demonstration
of the ability of rational catalyst design to affect the properties
of a catalyst in a detailed and predictable way, an area of intense
study, which will continue to influence how catalysts and materials
are prepared for decades to come.
