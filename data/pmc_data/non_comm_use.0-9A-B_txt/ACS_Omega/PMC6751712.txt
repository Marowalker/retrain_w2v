A new method based on the coffee
ring effect was developed for
improving the sensitivity, simplicity, and robustness of surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) in determining trace levels of analytes. In
this method, a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized silver colloidal
(AgC) solution was first prepared and mixed with a sample solution.
Following deposition of the mixture solution on a solid substrate
with a rough surface, a coffee ring was formed once the solvent had
evaporated. The formation of a coffee ring not only concentrated the
analyte but also reduced the space between silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
to strengthen the hotspot effect, thereby considerably improving SERS
sensitivity. To strengthen the coffee ring effect further, the surface
roughness of the solid support and PVP content of the AgC solution
were investigated. The results indicated that an increase in surface
roughness reduced the size of the coffee rings, whereas the addition
of PVP not only stabilized the AgNPs but also improved the compactness
of the coffee rings. When applying the proposed method to determine
the phenylalanine (Phe) level in urine for rapid screening of the
phenylketonuria disorder, strong chemical interference from uric acid
(UA), which is a major component in urine, was observed. To minimize
the interference from UA, ZnO powder was applied to the urine sample
to adsorb UA prior to SERS detection. After cleaning by using ZnO,
the SERS signals of Phe were revealed for quantitative purposes. Under
the optimized conditions, both the sensitivity and reproducibility
of SERS measurement considerably improved. Quantitative analyses revealed
that the developed method is highly feasible for the rapid determination
of Phe in real samples.

1 Introduction
Surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) is the phenomenon in which
the Raman scattering of molecules is enhanced by several orders of
magnitude when these molecules are adsorbed on or nearby the rough
metal surface. This enhancement of Raman scattering is usually explained
using the electromagnetic field effect1,2 and chemical
effect.3,4 Active SERS substrates are commonly prepared
through the immobilization of suitable metal nanostructures on a solid
support and are used to detect compounds through either deposition
or soaking of sample solution. For example, silver and gold nanostructures
have been decorated on solid supports of polymer nanofibers,5,6 paper,7,8 glass,9,10 and other materials.11−13 Although the reported sensitivity for these types of substrates
is promising, the short lifetime of the substrates, which is caused
by the surface oxidation of metal nanostructures, and the tedious
fabrication procedure involved have limited the practical application
of this type of substrates. Colloidal solution-based metal nanostructures
are easily prepared using wet chemical methods and are available for
mass production. With the assistance of stabilizing agents, the lifetime
of colloidal solutions can be extended to several weeks or even months.14−17 However, the density of metal nanostructures in the colloidal solution
must generally be low to prevent coagulation. This low density of
metal nanostructures in the colloidal solution results in low sensitivity
of SERS measurements, with the observed sensitivity usually 1 or 2
orders of magnitude lower than that observed for other substrate types.18,19

To improve the sensitivity of using colloidal solutions for
SERS
detection, several methods have been developed, including heat-induced
SERS sensing,20,21 solvent-induced hotspot,22 elasticity-induced stretchable membrane,23,24 coffee ring formation,25−27 and other28 methods. Among them, methods based on the coffee ring effect
are simple in detection, while the sensitivity is acceptable caused
by the strengthening of the hotspot effect. The formation of coffee
rings involves a spontaneous process in which surface solvent evaporation
leads to the concentration of the solute on the outer surface of the
liquid droplet. The solute molecules and metal nanostructures can
be packed closely during solvent evaporation, which causes strengthening
of the hotspot effect in SERS measurements.29

Coffee rings occur frequently when chemicals30 or biomolecules31,32 are deposited onto
a suitable solid support. This phenomenon has been employed in SERS
measurements through the deposition of a mixture of analytes and metal
colloids on an appropriate solid support, with the mixture forming
droplets. After solvent evaporation, suspended particles are deposited
at the periphery to form a coffee ring because of the capillary action
and weak Marangoni flow of the solvent.33−35 In SERS applications,
the formed coffee ring pattern affects both detection sensitivity
and reproducibility. For example, if a small and compact coffee ring
is formed, the packing density of the metal colloids is high, which
results in a strong hotspot effect. Therefore, regulating the formation
of the coffee ring is crucial for achieving high performance in SERS
applications. The size of the coffee ring is affected by the contact
angle of the droplet deposited on the solid support. The larger the
contact angle, the smaller is the coffee ring. The contact angle is
dependent on the roughness36,37 and hydrophobicity38 of the surface of the solid support. Moreover,
the chemical composition of the droplet influences its surface tension39,40 and causes variation in the contact angle. Therefore, to control
the formation of a coffee ring and enhance SERS intensity, the aforementioned
parameters and their effects on SERS measurements were investigated
in the present study. As illustrated in Figure 1, the substrate roughness and droplet chemical
composition were the parameters of focus, with the objective of reducing
the size of the formed coffee ring. Polycarbonate (PC) was selected
as the substrate because of its hydrophobicity, which led to large
contact angles and thus a small coffee ring. To alter the surface
roughness of PC substrates, the PC nanofiber (PCNF) film was produced
by electrospinning using different PC solutions. The prepared PCNF
films were three-dimensional structures, and their surface roughness
was controlled through the diameter of the nanofibers and air pockets
within the structures, and hence, the contact angle of aqueous droplets
could be varied. The effect of the droplet chemical composition on
the formed coffee ring was also examined using various concentrations
of the species in the droplets.

Figure 1 Schematic of controlling coffee ring formation
by varying the surface
roughness of the solid support and droplet chemical composition.

To investigate the performance of the formed coffee
ring for SERS
detection, phenylalanine (Phe) was selected because it is a key molecule
in terms of phenylketonuria (PKU) disorder.41−43 Detecting this
compound at a low level under strong interference in the urine matrix
is challenging. The determination of Phe requires sensitive detection
because its concentration in urine is 0.3–3.5 μM in healthy
adults44 and can be as high as 100 μM
in infants with the PKU disorder.45 Therefore,
a coffee ring method was developed that detects Phe in urine and can
be used to track the PKU disorder.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characteristics of the
Prepared Silver Colloidal
Solution and PCNF Film
When creating a coffee ring for SERS
detection, the properties of the silver colloidal (AgC) solution used
and solid support of the PCNF film are critical. Therefore, the morphology
of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in AgC solutions prepared with the
addition of different concentrations of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
solutions was first examined using ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
spectroscopy. A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band located around
420 nm was observed for any of the prepared AgC solution, indicating
that AgC solutions were successfully prepared (Figure 2A). SPR bands were marginally shifted within
10 nm for any examined PVP concentrations. This observation indicates
that the prepared AgNPs using different PVP concentrations are similar
in particle size.

without
the addition of PVP. Solutions were diluted 20 times with water before
measurement. (B) Variation in the SPR band intensity of the AgC solutions

prepared with a PC concentration of 11%. (F) SEM image of the PCNF
film prepared with 18% PC solution.

For analytical considerations, the long-term stability of the AgNPs
was investigated. As displayed in Figure 2B, the SPR band intensity for AgC0, AgC0.15, AgC0.3, and AgC0.45 changed
marginally over the first two days and then remained relatively constant
over 10 days. These results suggested that the PVP-stabilized AgC
solutions can be used for long periods of time. Moreover, two AgNP
solutions (AgC0 and AgC0.3) were characterized
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The images of AgC0 (Figure 2C)
reveal AgNPs with a particle size of approximately 60 nm, with a large
variation in the particle size and the coagulation of some particles.
By contrast, for the PVP-containing solution of AgC0.3,
the particle size was narrowly distributed and some rod-like nanostructures
were present (Figure 2D). According to the magnified TEM image (inset of Figure 2D), the formed particle size
was approximately 50 nm. The distribution of the particle size of
the formed AgNPs was narrower than that of the AgC0 solution
not containing PVP. The aforementioned results indicate that the addition
of PVP not only stabilized the AgNPs but also regulated the AgNPs
to have narrow size distribution.

To determine the impact of
the surface roughness of the solid support
on the formation of the coffee ring, PCNF films with different morphologies
were prepared according to our previous study11 by varying the concentration of the PC solution from 5 to 18%. The
prepared PCNF films were characterized through scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). The results indicated that bead-free PCNF films could be prepared
when the concentration of the PC solution was higher than 13%. Figure 2E depicts an SEM
image of a PCNF film prepared from 11% PC solution. Numerous beads
with fine nanofibers can be observed in the image. When the PC concentration
was higher than 13%, the prepared PCNF films were bead-free. Figure 2F displays the SEM
image of the PCNF film prepared from 18% PC solution. This PCNF film
contained bead-free nanofibers. The diameter of the fibers ranged
from 200 to 500 nm, and the fibers were loosely packed.

2.2 Effect of Solid Support on Coffee Ring Formation
To
determine the influence of the roughness and hydrophobicity
of the solid support on the formation of a coffee ring, three types
of solid support were examined: a glass plate, a PC plate, and PCNF
films. PCNF films prepared using 18% PC solution were used in evaluations
of the ring formation performance. To ensure that the AgC and PCNF
films did not cause spectral interference, the Raman spectra of the
bare PCNF film and the coffee ring formed by depositing AgC0.3 on this PCNF film (AgC0.3@PCNF) were acquired (Figure 3A). The spectrum
of the PCNF film itself does not have any spectral features; however,
some weak spectral features are observable for AgC0.3@PCNF.
After mixing 1 mM Phe with AgC0.3 in a volume ratio of
1:1, the formed solution (Phe–AgC0.3) was deposited
on a PCNF film and dried (Phe–AgC0.3@PCNF). The
SERS spectrum of Phe–AgC0.3@PCNF is displayed in Figure 3A along with the
liquid spectrum of Phe–AgC0.3 and solid Phe. Considering
the liquid spectra of Phe–AgC0.3, Phe could not
be detected effectively if no coffee ring was formed. Once a coffee
ring was formed on the PCNF film, a high-quality spectrum could be
obtained and the spectral feature of Phe matched with that in the
conventional Raman spectrum of solid Phe. Also, the spectral features
are consistent with those in the literature,46,47 as shown in Figure 3A with band assignments. The intense symmetric ring stretching band
at 997 cm–1 was selected for quantitative evaluation
in later analyses.

(Phe–AgC0.3), and a coffee ring of Phe–AgC0.3 deposited on the PCNF film (Phe–AgC0.3@PCNF). (B) Photographs of coffee rings formed on glass, a PC plate,
and PCNF films (5–18%). (C) Peak intensities at 997 cm–1 in the dark band (outer band, ●) and center
(■) for the coffee ring formed on different solid supports
as shown in (B).

To evaluate the effect
of the surface roughness of the solid support
on coffee ring formation, a series of PCNF films were produced using
PC solutions with concentrations ranging from 5 to 18%. Phe–AgC0.3 (1 mM Phe, volume ratio 1:1) was used for characterization.
Furthermore, a glass plate and PC plate were used as points of comparison
with the PCNF films. After depositing and then drying 10 μL
of Phe–AgC0.3 solution on the prepared PCNF films,
SERS spectra were acquired from the outer band and center of the coffee
rings. Photographs of the coffee rings formed on different solid supports
are illustrated in Figure 3B. The coffee rings formed on PC and glass had a considerably
larger diameter than those formed on the PCNF films. Also, when PCNF
films produced with PC concentrations lower than 13% were used as
the support, some dark areas could be observed inside the coffee rings.
The SEM results indicated that PCNF films produced with a concentration
of 11% had beads on their surface. These beads may hinder the movement
of AgC solution during solvent evaporation and lead to dark spots
inside the coffee rings. Raman spectra were acquired in the dark band
and center areas of the coffee rings, and the variation in the Phe
intensity at 997 cm–1 for different solid supports
is illustrated in Figure 3C. Considerably more intense SERS bands with smaller variation
are observed in the spectra of the PCNF films produced from 13 to
18% PC solutions compared with those produced from 5 to 11% PC solutions.
The SERS intensities are almost 15 times stronger in the PCNF film
spectra than in the glass and PC plate spectra. On the other hand,
the higher the surface roughness of the solid support, the higher
is the intensity of the SERS signals.

2.3 Effect
of PVP Concentration on Coffee Ring
Formation
The size of a coffee ring is also affected by the
surface tension of the liquid droplets. To examine this effect, AgC
solutions were prepared with different amounts of PVP. PCNF films
prepared with 18% PC solution were used as the solid support. After
mixing an AgC solution with 1 mM Phe in equal volume, 10 μL
of the mixture was deposited on a PCNF film. After drying, the formed
coffee rings were subjected to SERS measurement. The coffee rings
formed from Phe–AgC0.15, Phe–AgC0.3, and Phe–AgC0.45 were first cross-scanned from
one end of the ring to the other. The intensity of Phe at 997 cm–1 was plotted against the location, as displayed in Figure 4A. In addition, the
Phe intensity at the dark ring and center regions was plotted against
the PVP concentration, as illustrated in Figure 4B. Figure 4A reveals that the diameter of the formed coffee ring
is approximately 2 mm, with small variation for all the examined solutions.
Thus, the PVP concentration did not strongly affect the size of the
coffee ring. However, the intensity of Phe varied significantly with
different amounts of PVP, as illustrated in Figure 4B. The variation in the band intensity was
caused by the formation of coffee rings of different widths of the
dark band. To verify this finding, the coffee rings of Phe–AgC0, Phe–AgC0.15, Phe–AgC0.3, and Phe–AgC0.45 were examined through SEM. The
resulting images for Phe–AgC0, Phe–AgC0.15, Phe–AgC0.3, and Phe–AgC0.45 are presented in Figure 4C–F, respectively. In these images, no clear
band can be observed for the coffee ring formed when no PVP was added
(Figure 4C, AgC0). The addition of PVP into the AgC solution resulted in clear
bands, and the width of the band of the coffee ring increased as the
PVP concentration was increased.

2.4 Effect of AgC Concentration
on Coffee Ring
Formation for SERS Detection
The formation of a coffee ring
can increase the tightness in the packing of AgNPs to exert a strong
hotspot effect. The amount of AgC required to form coffee rings that
exert a sufficiently strong hotspot effect was investigated. AgC0.3 solution was diluted with different amounts of water. The
diluted AgC solutions were then mixed with 5 mM Phe in a volume ratio
of 9:1 to obtain a final Phe concentration of 0.5 mM, which is the
same as the concentration used in above studies. To describe the findings
clearly, the relative concentration of AgC (AgC %) was defined as VAgC/(VAgC + Vwater) × 100%. As displayed in the plot
of the observed SERS intensity of Phe at 997 cm–1 against AgC % (Figure 5), the SERS intensity plateaued when AgC % reached 55.6%. Smaller
concentrations of AgC result in considerably reduced SERS intensity.
This result reveals that if AgC % is lower than 55.6%, the amount
of AgC is insufficient to form dark bands and to exert a strong hotspot
effect for detection. As illustrated in the photographs displayed
in the inset of Figure 5, the darkness of the ring region of the coffee ring decreased as
AgC % was decreased, whereas the width of the dark band remained constant.
If the AgC concentration is considerably diluted, it would be unable
to form a coffee ring with a strong hotspot effect. When AgC % is
close to 55.6%, the amount of AgNPs that form the coffee ring is close
to the amount of undiluted AgC mixed with the sample solution in a
volume ratio of 1:1.

in
the center (■) and dark band (●) of the coffee rings.
Phe solution (5 mM) was mixed with diluted AgC0.3 in a
volume ratio of 1:9. Inset: Photographs of the coffee rings formed
using different dilutions.

2.5 Quantitative Aspects
The linearity
of the SERS response of Phe was examined by mixing a 1:1 volume ratio
of AgC0.3 with Phe solution. The original concentration
of Phe (before mixing) in the sample solution was recorded and used
to construct the calibration curve plotted in Figure 6. A linear relationship was obtained in the
concentration region lower than 500 μM with a regression coefficient
(R2) of 0.997. The estimated detection
limit based on three times the noise level was approximately 2.35
μM. This detection limit indicates that our developed method
improves the sensitivity in SERS detection by controlling the formation
of coffee rings. Comparing with the literature reported methods, our
developed method is competitive as the reported detection limits are
in the range of 0.1–15 μM.47−52 For instance, separation techniques combined with mass detection
showed a detection limit within 1–6 μM49,50 and SERS methods gave a detection limit around 10 μM.47,48

Figure 6 Peak
intensity at 997 cm–1 for Phe located in
the dark area of the coffee ring formed by mixing an equal volume
of AgC0.3 solution with Phe of different concentrations
on an 18% PCNF film. The Phe solutions included solutions with (●)
and without (■) ZnO powder pretreatment.

In a real sample of urine, a strong matrix effect usually occurs.
Therefore, the possible interfering species in a urine sample were
first investigated. These species included amino acids and some metabolites.
Selected interfering species were detected individually by using the
optimized conditions determined previously in the present study. The
spectra obtained for amino acids and metabolites are presented in Figure 7A,B, respectively.
With the exception of tryptophan, amino acids could not be effectively
detected (Figure 7A).
Fortunately, the peak for the quantitative analysis of Phe is located
at 997 cm–1, which is not spectrally interfered
by tryptophan. In the analysis of the major metabolites in urine (Figure 7B), the spectral
features of uric acid (UA), creatinine, and urea could be observed
but not those of ammonia. In terms of spectral interference, only
UA exhibits a weak broad band at the band position used for the quantitative
analysis of Phe.

Figure 7 SERS spectra of amino acids (A) and other main species
(B) in urine.
The spectra were obtained from the ring of the coffee ring. The original
prepared concentration for each species was 1 mM. After mixing with
AgC0.3 by equal volume, 10 μL of the mixture was
deposited on a PCNF film to form coffee rings for SERS detection.

To further investigate the chemical interference
caused by the
aforementioned compounds, interfering species were added to the Phe
solution. The results are presented in Table 1. Amino acids did not cause strong chemical
interference with Phe detection. However, the compounds of UA, creatinine,
and urea caused severe suppression of the Phe band intensity. This
indicates that these species are capable of adsorbing onto the surface
of AgC and occupying the active sites, thereby suppressing the SERS
intensity of Phe. To overcome this problem, ZnO powder was employed
to adsorb the major component of UA in the urine samples. According
to the literature,53,54 ZnO strongly interacts with UA
while remaining in the solid form. To examine its capability to remove
UA, different amounts of ZnO powder were used to pretreat the sample
solution for 10 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was
employed as a sample for detection. Three aqueous solutions of 50,
100, and 200 μM UA were pretreated with different amounts of
ZnO powder to examine the powder’s cleaning efficiency. The
strong peak of UA at 1333 cm–1 (Figure 7B) was used to indicate the
residual UA after treatment with ZnO powder. The SERS spectra obtained
using the coffee ring method for nontreated UA and ZnO-treated solutions
are displayed in Figure 8A. The spectra indicate that UA was completely removed, and the amount
of ZnO required for complete cleaning varied with the UA concentration,
as illustrated in Figure 8B. Approximately 2, 4, and 8% w/v of ZnO were required to
completely remove 50, 100, and 200 μM UA, respectively (Figure 8B). Conversely, 1%
w/v ZnO could completely remove 25 μM of UA from the liquid
solution.

To further study the influence of ZnO on the detection of Phe,
50 μM Phe was treated with different amounts of ZnO and the
obtained SERS intensity of Phe at 997 cm–1 was plotted
against the added amount of ZnO (Figure 8C). The addition of ZnO was discovered to
reduce the Phe intensity; however, the Phe intensity remained at approximately
80% of the nontreated Phe intensity. These results indicate that the
interaction between Phe and ZnO was weak. Therefore, the addition
of ZnO effectively removed UA with a marginal decrease in the sensitivity
of Phe detection. To further identify any cross-interaction between
UA and Phe, a sample solution containing 50 μM Phe and 50 μM
UA was examined. After treatment with 2% w/v ZnO, the SERS intensity
of Phe remained at 80% of the original intensity, as illustrated in Figure 8D. This finding indicates
that the cross-interaction between Phe and UA was also weak.

2.6 Application of the Proposed Approach for Detecting
Phe in Urine Samples
To evaluate the accuracy of the developed
method for real-world samples, urine samples were collected from three
healthy adult volunteers for 24 h and Phe was spiked into each of
the collected sample with a concentration of 50 μM. According
to the literature,55,56 the UA concentration in a urine
sample ranges from 0.6 to 6 mM. The amount of ZnO powder required
for removing such a high concentration of UA is too high to obtain
a clear supernatant. Therefore, urine samples were diluted 10 times
before analysis. Based on above studies, 1% w/v ZnO removes 25 μM
UA. Considering that 6 mM is the highest concentration of UA found
in urine samples, 24% ZnO powder can remove all UA after 10×
dilution. Therefore, 30% w/v ZnO powder was used to clean up UA prior
to Phe detection. The standard addition method was employed to eliminate
the effect of ZnO powder on Phe detection. After the ZnO treatment,
the concentration of Phe was determined using the one-point standard
addition method. The estimated recovery was 99.2%(±6.8%), 102.4%(±1.6%),
and 97.8%(±1.2%) for the three urine samples. These results indicate
that our developed method is highly applicable for patients with PKU
disorder.

3 Conclusions
In this
study, coffee rings were successfully prepared on PCNF
films by using PVP-stabilized AgC solutions. The coffee rings were
used to determine the Phe concentration for addressing the PKU disorder.
The preparation of an AgC solution is simple and the prepared AgC
is highly stable. To improve the sensitivity of detection, the roughness
of the solid support and composition of AgC were examined. The results
indicated that a tight coffee ring formed on the hydrophobic PCNF
film produced from a high-concentration PC solution. The composition
of AgC did not affect the size of the coffee rings. The developed
method was then employed to detect Phe in urine samples. The strong
matrix effect from UA was suppressed by employing a simple cleaning
step. Successful results were obtained in the determination of Phe
in urine samples. Thus, the developed method is sensitive for Phe
detection and is readily applicable to the screening of the PKU disorder.

An electrospinning machine
was purchased from MECC Co. (NANON-1A, Fukuoka, Japan). The machine
comprised a 6 mL plastic syringe with an 18-gauge stainless-steel

4.3 Preparation of AgC Solution
The method
of preparing the AgC solution was modified from the methods in the
literature.16,17 Citrate and PVP were used as
the reducing and stabilizing agents, respectively. To prepare a 50
mL aqueous AgC solution, 1 mM silver nitrate and different concentrations
of PVP (0–0.75% w/v) were first prepared in a conical flask.
The solution was boiled for 10 min and 1 mL of 1% w/v trisodium citrate
aqueous solution was then added dropwise, after which this solution
was heated to a gentle boil for 15 min with mild stirring. The final
AgC solution had a pale greenish brown color. The prepared AgC solution
was stored in a refrigerator until use. To abridge the description,
AgC solution prepared with x % w/v PVP is abbreviated
as AgCx.

4.4 Preparation
of PCNFs
PCNF films were
prepared using our previously developed electrospinning method.6 PC pellets of different weights were dissolved
using 10 mL of a mixed solvent of THF and DMF (3:1). The PC solution
with 1.8 g of PC pellets dissolved in 10 mL of 3:1 THF/DMF solvent
was named as18% PC solution. After the PC had dissolved well, the
solution was loaded into a syringe tube. A drum collector (1000 rpm)
was used to collect the PCNF films. The electrospinning voltage, collector
distance, and feed rate were fixed at 30 kV, 50 mm, and 1.2 mL/h,
respectively. Within 3 h of spinning, self-standing PCNF films could
be produced.

4.5 Detection Procedure
For detection,
the sample and AgC solutions were mixed in a designed volume ratio.
Then, 10 μL of this mixture was pipetted carefully onto the
surface of a PCNF film. The liquid droplet that formed on the PCNF
film was dried in a 70 °C oven for 10 min and subsequently subjected
to Raman measurement.
