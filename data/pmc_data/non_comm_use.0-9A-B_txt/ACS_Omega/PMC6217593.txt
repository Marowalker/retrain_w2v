We
report the synthesis of two water-soluble BODIPY dyes with far-red
absorption and near-infrared fluorescence following cell membrane
insertion. Introduction of dicationic or dianionic groups imparts
water solubility and prevents translocation of the dye through the
plasma membrane for highly effective labeling. The dicationic form
is particularly well localized to the plasma membrane and resists
quenching even after >8 min of continuous light exposure. The dyes
are almost completely nonemissive in water and other highly polar
solvents, but display high-fluorescence yields in chloroform and upon
insertion into the extracellular leaflet.

Introduction
Optical imaging of
cells provides tremendous insight into a myriad
of biological processes,1 and fluorescence-based
imaging is an especially sensitive approach2 that is applied to wide-ranging scientific fields such as clinical
diagnostics,3 biochemistry and molecular
biology,4 and materials science.5 Fluorescence microscopy is well suited to cell-based
investigations due to its inherent high sensitivity and specificity,
spatiotemporal range and sampling capabilities, and biocompatability.6,7 Commonly used fluorescent reporters include proteins, inorganic
compounds, and small molecule dyes.8 Of
particular interest in bioimaging are far-red to NIR-emissive (>650
nm) dyes. The wavelength range of 650–1350 nm is commonly referred
to as the “physiological” or “optical”
window where light has its maximum depth of penetration into tissue.
Additionally, NIR emitters show improved signal-to-noise ratio by
avoiding autofluorescence resulting from indiscriminate excitation
of various normal cellular components.9 Longer excitation wavelengths also reduce light scattering, and
the potential for photoinduced cell damage as a high signal-to-noise
ratio plus lower energy excitation allows much longer observations
of viable cells.10

Notable NIR-emissive
dyes include cyanines,11 squaraines,11 Alexa750,12 rhodamines,12 and
phthalocyanines.13 These dyes show strong
absorbance and fluorescence, but can suffer from a variety of performance
issues, including aggregation,11 photobleaching,14 unspecific binding to cell components,15 and poor hydrophilicity.8,16 Dyes
derived from 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene17 (BODIPY
dyes) possess similar photophysical properties (strong absorptivity
and high-fluorescence quantum yield) to the dyes listed above but
are known to be photostable.18 As with
other organic dyes, BODIPYs can be synthetically modified to suit
the target applications and several derivatives have been prepared
that resist aggregation and have outstanding aqueous solubility.18,19 Improved aqueous solubility has facilitated their use in aqueous
media and minimized cytotoxicity issues commonly seen when organic
solvents such as ethanol, dimethylformamide, or dimethyl sulfoxide
are required to predissolve and/or load dyes.20 Due to these desirable traits, preparation of BODIPY dyes is currently
an active area of research in bioanalysis and bioimaging.9,21−24

Results and Discussion
We have developed a novel BODIPY
system, shown in Chart 1, that exhibits two interesting
and valuable properties: extended residence time in cell membranes
and a fluorescence “turn-on” effect in the presence
of surfactant in aqueous solution. Both of these characteristics indicate
applicability in cell membrane analyses. To demonstrate the potential
use of these dyes in membrane analyses, we selected plasma membrane
staining, an important application of fluorescence-based cell imaging.13 Outlining cells with fluorescent reporters provides
critical spatial information. Cell membranes participate in numerous
cellular events, including cell division and endocytosis. Furthermore,
patency or disruption of the plasma membrane is a hallmark of apoptosis.25 Fluorescence-based cell membrane imaging allows
for real-time visualization of these essential cellular events.26−28 In addition to membrane labeling, 1 shows additional
utility as a voltage sensing dye, which will be the subject of an
additional report.

Chart 1 BODIPY Dyes 1 and 2a
a Positions on the BODIPY core
are labeled in red.



In the effort to prepare
a photostable, NIR fluorescent, water-soluble
membrane probe, we designed dyes 1 and 2, shown in Chart 1. Both dyes are derivatives of borondipyrromethene (BODIPY),29,30 with a dibutylaminophenylene vinylene group attached to the 3-position
on the BODIPY.31,32 This dibutylaminophenylene vinylene
group extends the conjugation of the BODIPY chromophore, resulting
in >100 nm bathochromic shifts in absorbance and emission relative
to the parent chromophore.5,33 We achieved water solubility
by installing charged groups via phenylene linkers at the 8-position.
Dye 1 contains a dication prepared by alkylating diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane
(DABCO) and has excellent water solubility across the biological pH
range. Dye 2 contains a dicarboxylic acid prepared with
itaconic acid and is soluble in basic water. The butyl groups on the
aminophenylene unit balance the oleophilic nature of one end of the
molecule with the hydrophilic nature of the other end, resulting in
an amphiphilic molecule able to partially insert into micelles or
membranes with a hydrophilic end anchoring part of the molecule outside
the membrane. We investigated other alkyl groups for the aniline moiety
(dimethyl, dioctyl, methyl-hexadecyl) and the butyl groups provided
the best oleophilic and hydrophilic combination. Both 1 and 2 label cell membranes, with the hydrophobic chromophore
positioned on the membrane interior and the hydrophilic group extending
into the extracellular area. In particular, 1 is an excellent
label for cell plasma membranes with almost no signal visible from
intracellular membranes observed over several hours.

We prepared
dyes 1 and 2 following the
procedure shown in Scheme 1, designed to prepare both dyes from a common intermediate.
Intermediate 3 is an aminophenylene vinylene-substituted
BODIPY with an iodophenyl group in the meso position. We used the
iodo group to add the charged groups on 1 and 2. We prepared 3 by Knoevenagel coupling between commercially
available 8-iodophenyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl BODIPY and 4-N,N-dibutylaminobenzaldehyde, using 0.5 equiv of
aldehyde to suppress the formation of the bis-addition product. From 3, we prepared 2 in one step via Heck coupling
with itaconic acid. We prepared intermediate 6, the precursor
to 1, by Sonogashira reaction between 3 and
propargyl alcohol followed by mesylation of the alcohol group to give
intermediate 6. We transformed 6 into 1 by quaternization of 1-methyl-1-azonia-4-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane
mesylate, which was prepared by alkylation of DABCO by methyl methanesulfonate.

Scheme 1 Preparation of 1 and 2
(i) 4-N,N-Dibutylaminobenzaldehyde, p-toluenesulfonic
acid monohydrate, piperidine, toluene. (ii) Itaconic acid, Pd(OAc)2, P(o-tol)3, NBu4Br,
MeCN, NEt3. (iii) Propargyl alcohol, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, CuI, 3:1 THF/NEt3. (iv) MsCl,
NEt3, DCM. (v) MeOMs, MeCN. (vi) MeCN, 60 °C.

The absorbance and emission spectra of dyes 1 and 2 in chloroform are presented in Figure 1 and their photophysical
properties are summarized
in Table 1. Each dye
shows one main absorbance band with maxima at 625–630 nm and
one main emission band with maxima at 675–690 nm. While the
shapes of the spectra are similar to other known BODIPY dyes, the
maxima appear at longer wavelength. This is consistent with the extended
pi electronic structures of 1 and 2 compared
to other BODIPYs. Dye 1 has a slightly larger Stokes’
shift (60 nm, 0.171 eV) than dye 2 (53 nm, 0.155 eV),
indicating that in chloroform, the excited state of dye 1 is stabilized relative to that of dye 2; this may be
due to the itaconic acid group being more inductive than the DABCO
group. The measured molar absorptivity and fluorescence quantum yields
are similar to other reported far-red BODIPYs.18

To illustrate
the suitability of 1 as a fluorescent
plasma membrane-specific label, we measured the absorbance and emission
of 1 in water and in 0.7% Triton X-100 surfactant. The
spectra and photographs of the solutions are shown in Figure 2. In pure water, the main absorbance
band is broad and featureless except for a small shoulder on the high-energy
edge, and emission is minimal. However, the fluorescence excitation
spectrum does not overlap with the absorbance spectrum (Supporting
Information Figure S12), indicating that
the detected emission is not from 1. We attribute this
residual emission to either a small impurity or a slightly emissive
aggregate. In Triton X-100, the main absorbance band is narrower with
a more defined high-energy shoulder, and strong emission is observed.
The change in absorbance in response to surfactant addition is characteristic
of aggregate disruption. We believe that in pure water, the dye molecules
assemble into particles with the charged groups on the surface solvated
by water and the hydrophobic chromophores grouped together on the
interior. Such arrangements are known to broaden absorbance curves
and quench emission. Triton X-100 disrupts the aggregation by providing
a hydrophobic pocket for individual dye molecules, shielding from
both the water and other dye molecules, resulting in absorbance and
emission characteristics similar to those observed in organic solvent.
The strong fluorescence of the dyes in the surfactant solution is
most likely due to both this disruption of dye aggregation and the
placement of the dye core in the nonpolar environment of the micelle
interior. Interestingly, 1 remains nonemissive in sodium
dodecyl sulfate solution (Supporting Information Figure S13). This selectivity indicates a preference for certain
matrices, highlighting its ability to be an effective membrane probe.

(solid lines) and emission (dashed lines) of 1 in water
and 0.7% Triton X-100 surfactant. Bottom: photographs
of 1 under ambient light (left) and 365 nm light (right).

When applied in vivo to cells
and tissues,34 the dyes similarly orient
themselves with the hydrophobic chromophore
embedded into the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane while the charged
groups (dication for 1 and dianion for 2) remain in the extracellular space.35 It is common for dyes, even charged ones, to appear in intracellular
membranes. This yields a signal that is difficult to interpret; indeed,
dyes are sometimes described as dual-use with the first being a short-lived
outer leaflet reporter and the second being a mitochondrial reporter.36,37 Dianionic BODIPY 2 behaved in this manner, as shown
by the diffuse intracellular emission seen in Figure 3. This internalization is likely the result
of membrane turnover beginning with endocytosis of plasma membrane.
In contrast, the majority of the dicationic BODIPY 1 signal
persisted in the outer leaflet for over 8 h of observation, with only
a negligible amount entering the intracellular space (unpublished
results). We believe that the presence of two charges in close proximity
blocks the translocation and internalization of the dye. This allows
for greatly prolonged experiments when combined with the high photostability
of the dye. Furthermore, we observed no cytotoxicity with these probes
at concentrations 10× the working concentration (Supporting Information Figure S14). The nonemissive nature of 1 in sodium dodecyl sulfate further indicates that 1 is only emissive in specific systems.

dye 2 (right) labeled Xenopus tadpoles,

outlining of cells for dye 1 and the diffuse staining
observed with dye 2.

Conclusions
In conclusion, two new water-soluble, far-red-absorbing
and NIR-emitting
fluorescent dyes were synthesized that exhibit interesting amphiphilic
properties. Building from a common BODIPY starting dye, dicationic
and dianionic versions were made. Both of these water-soluble dyes
exhibit excellent photostability and high-fluorescence quantum yields
upon transition from a purely aqueous environment to one containing
lipophilic regions (such as aqueous suspensions of micelles or membranes),
making them intriguing candidates for cell labeling applications.
Investigation of their utility as cell membrane stains and functional
reporters of membrane potential changes (voltage sensitive dyes) is
ongoing and will be reported in another publication.
