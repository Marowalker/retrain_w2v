Graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs) have recently emerged as alternative
2D semiconductors owing to their fascinating electronic properties
that include tunable band gaps and high charge-carrier mobilities.
Identifying the atomic-scale edge structures of GNRs through structural
investigations is very important to fully understand the electronic
properties of these materials. Herein, we report an atomic-scale analysis
of GNRs using simulated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
Raman spectroscopy. Tetracene with zigzag edges and chrysene with
armchair edges were selected as initial model structures, and their
XPS and Raman spectra were analyzed. Structurally expanded nanoribbons
based on tetracene and chrysene, in which zigzag and armchair edges
were combined in various ratios, were then simulated. The edge structures
of chain-shaped nanoribbons composed only of either zigzag edges or
armchair edges were distinguishable by XPS and Raman spectroscopy,
depending on the edge type. It was also possible to distinguish planar
nanoribbons consisting of both zigzag and armchair edges with zigzag/armchair
ratios of 4:1 or 1:4, indicating that it is possible to analyze normally
synthesized GNRs because their zigzag to armchair edge ratios are
usually greater than 4 or less than 0.25. Our study on the precise
identification of GNR edge structures by XPS and Raman spectroscopy
provides the groundwork for the analysis of GNRs.

Introduction
Graphene nanoribbons
(GNRs) have attracted attention as promising
materials for nanosize electronics such as field-effect transistors.1,2 GNRs have two basic edge structures, namely zigzag and armchair,
and these edge structures have been intensively studied because the
electronic and magnetic properties of GNRs depend on them.3−9 GNRs with zigzag edges exhibit spin-polarized edge states with energies
close to the Fermi level,3−7 but GNRs with armchair edges have band gaps that are sensitive to
the ribbon width.7 The chemical properties
of GNRs are also sensitive to the crystallographic orientations of
their edges.10−12 The reactivity of zigzag edges toward halogenation
is greater than that of armchair edges because of the large number
of electrons at the zigzag edges.10

Zigzag and armchair edges in GNRs synthesized by bottom-up fabrication
have been observed by microscopic techniques such as scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM).13−15 For example, the edge electronic states have been
directly observed by STM,13−15 but long times are required for
the analysis of edge positions. Moreover, probing the entire sample
by atomic-scale microscopy is challenging; hence, it is necessary
to develop other analytical techniques.

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) is a representative surface
analysis method for determining the chemical composition and states
of carbon materials.16−24 Computational XPS has revealed defective carbon material structures
such as sp3C–sp3C,19 edge C–H,20 functional
groups,21,22 vacancy defects,23,24 and pentagonal and heptagonal rings20,23,24 in graphene. Unfortunately, spectral differences
between the zigzag and armchair edges in graphene have not been reported
because the number of carbon atoms at the edges of graphene is negligible
compared to that in its basal plane. However, it is essential to clarify
the peak positions of zigzag and armchair edges in GNRs.

Raman
spectroscopy is also among the most used methods for analyzing
carbon materials because the presence of disorder in sp2-carbon systems results in Raman spectral resonances.25 Raman spectroscopy is commonly used to determine
the number of layers, defect density, strain, thermal properties,
and level of doping in graphene by examining its signature G, D, D′,
and planar bands.26−32 Moreover, the zigzag and armchair edges in graphene have been determined
by Raman spectroscopy, which revealed that the D band of a zigzag
edge is considerably less intense than that of an armchair edge.25,33−36 In addition, several bands originating from the zigzag and armchair
edges still need to be assigned.

In this work, C 1s XPS spectra
of tetracene with zigzag edges and
chrysene with armchair edges as well as their expanded structures
were simulated using density functional theory (DFT). In addition,
the Raman spectra of GNRs were simulated to determine the spectral
differences between the zigzag and armchair edges. As a complementary
experimental approach, tetracene, chrysene, and highly oriented pyrolytic
graphite (HOPG) were analyzed by XPS and Raman spectroscopy.

Results
and Discussion
Electronic Properties
The difference
between the electronic
property of zigzag and armchair GNRs, such as the band gap, has been
reported.37−39 The reported band gaps of zigzag GNRs are smaller
than those of armchair GNRs,37 and the
band gap increases with increasing size of the GNR.38,39Table 1 shows the
band gaps for various GNRs with zigzag and armchair edges. In Table 1, chain structures
with zigzag edges are abbreviated as “ZN,”
where “Z” refers to “zigzag” and N is the number of aromatic rings (Figure 1b). Similarly, “AN” refers to chains of armchair structures with N armchair
edges (Figure 1b).
Planar structures with zigzag and armchair edges (Figure 1c) are similarly referred to
as “ZX-AY” or “AX-ZY” (Figure 1c). X and Y are the numbers of aromatic rings. Similar to the results of previous
reports, GNRs based on Z8 have smaller band gaps than GNRs based on
A8 of the same size. Moreover, the band gaps increase with increasing
size of the GNRs.

atoms are omitted.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Tetracene, chrysene,
and HOPG were analyzed by XPS, and their XPS C 1s spectra are shown
in Figure 2a. The binding
energy of the C 1s spectral peak of each sample was obtained after
adjusting the energy of the valence band edge to 0 eV (Figure 2b). The full width at half-maximum
values are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The spectra reveal the lack of C 1s peak shifts
due to adsorbed oxygen atoms, considering the number of oxygen atoms
on tetracene, chrysene, and HOPG (Figure S1). Tetracene and chrysene were examined thrice at identical positions
to confirm that the X-ray beam did not damage the samples; indeed,
no peak changes were observed (Figure S2).

Figure 2 Experimental XPS spectra acquired for tetracene, chrysene, and
HOPG: (a) XPS C 1s spectra and (b) XPS spectra at the valence band
edge.

Interestingly, the C 1s peaks
of tetracene with zigzag edges and
chrysene with armchair edges appeared at 283.9 and 283.3 eV, respectively
(Figure 2a), although
tetracene and chrysene contain identical number of carbon and hydrogen
atoms (Figure 1). Moreover,
this difference between the peak positions of tetracene and chrysene
was also observed in the simulated XPS spectra (Figure 3a–c), indicating that the C 1s peak
is positioned at a higher binding energy in the zigzag edge case.
The analogous peak in the spectrum of HOPG was observed at 284.3 eV
(Figure 2a). The differences
in the peak positions of the various samples can be explained by their
work functions, which were calculated in this study to be 4.87, 5.53,
and 3.76 eV for Z4 (tetracene), A4 (chrysene), and Z8-A8, respectively,
from the energy differences between the HOMO levels and the vacuum
level20 (Figure 1). The binding energies were observed to
decrease with increasing work function value as the valence band edge
approached the atomic nuclei.20

Having acquired and simulated
the XPS spectra of tetracene, chrysene,
and HOPG (Figures 2 and 3), the spectra of expanded aromatic
hydrocarbons with zigzag and armchair edges were next simulated (Figures 1 and 3). To determine how the peak positions in the spectra depend
on the edge structure, we simulated the XPS spectra of the expanded
chain structures, which are large-sized structures without conjugated
carbons in their basal planes (Figure 3a–c). In the chain structures based on tetracene
(Figures 1b and 3a), the C 1s peak observed at 283.9 eV for Z4 was
slightly shifted to 284.2 eV in the spectrum of Z20, but the energy
of this peak did not change further as the number of benzene rings
was increased, as in Z40. These results show that the C 1s peaks do
not undergo any extreme shifts in this system.

In the chain
structures based on chrysene (Figures 1b and 3b), the C 1s
peak observed at 283.3 eV for A4 shifted slightly to 283.4 eV in the
spectrum of A8, but this peak energy exhibited no further change with
increasing number of benzene rings (A20 and A40). Figure 3c reveals that the difference
in the Z4 and A4 C 1s peak energies is 0.6 eV, with values of 0.7
eV (Z8/A8), 0.8 eV (Z20/A20), and 0.8 eV (Z40/A40) for the remaining
differences, which demonstrates that the zigzag and armchair edges
in these chain structures are distinguishable by XPS.

Figures 1c and 3d reveal that the peak observed for Z8 (284.1 eV)
shifted to 284.3 eV as the number of tiers was increased to Z8-A4,
but no further shift was observed upon the inclusion of additional
tiers. Similarly, Figures 1c and 3e reveal that the peak corresponding
to A8 (283.4 eV) shifted to 284.3 eV as the number of tiers was increased
to A8-Z6, but no further shift was observed upon the inclusion of
additional tiers. The observed peak shifts to higher binding energies
with increasing number of tiers are ascribable to increments in the
number of conjugated carbons in the basal plane.

Comparison
of the spectra of the planar Z8- and A8-based structures
(Figure 3f) reveals
the difference between the Z8 and A8 C 1s peak energies to be 0.7
eV and that between Z8-A2 and A8-Z2 to be 0.5 eV. These results reveal
that GNR structures can be distinguished by XPS because the peaks
in the spectra of Z8-A2 (zigzag/armchair = 4:1) and A8-Z2 (zigzag/armchair
= 1:4) are observed at different energy values. However, these differences
decrease as the structures are expanded in planar directions (Figure 3f) because the number
of carbon atoms on the edges is negligible compared to that in the
basal planes. For example, the C 1s peaks for Z8-A4 and A8-Z4 are
separated by 0.1 eV, whereas those for Z8-A6 and A8-Z6 are identical
(0 eV difference) (Figure 3f).

Raman Spectroscopy
Figure 4 shows the experimental and
simulated Raman
spectra of tetracene and chrysene; the experimental spectra were obtained
at a laser excitation wavelength of 785 nm because background fluorescence
emissions can occur at shorter laser wavelengths such as 514 and 633
nm.40Tables S2 and S3 summarize the peak assignments for the Raman spectra of
tetracene and chrysene, respectively; all peaks in the experimental
spectra were assigned by observing their vibrational modes (Movies, Supporting
Information).

Figure 4 Experimental and simulated Raman spectra: (a) tetracene
and (b)
chrysene.

The experimental Raman spectrum
of tetracene (Figure 4a and Table S2) shows peaks at 997, 1179, and 1196 cm–1 that originate from C–H bending vibrations, whereas the peaks
at 1383, 1447, 1541, and 1615 cm–1 are assigned
to C–C stretching, C–C stretching vibration, C–C
ring stretching, and C–C vibration, respectively; the peak
at 3077 cm–1 is due to C–H stretching. The
experimental Raman spectrum of chrysene (Figure 4b and Table S3) shows peaks at 1018 and 1230 cm–1 that correspond
to C–H bending vibrations, whereas the peaks at 1380, 1434,
1576, and 1621 cm–1 are assigned to various C–C
stretching vibrations; the peak at 3060 cm–1 is
due to C–H stretching. Detailed peak assignments are provided
in Tables S1 and S2 and Movies (Supporting Information).
The peaks in the simulated Raman spectra match well with those in
the experimental Raman spectra (Figure 4 and Tables S1 and S2).

With these Raman spectra as references, the spectra of the expanded
aromatic hydrocarbons with zigzag and armchair edges were simulated
(Figures 1 and S3). Because only peaks in the 1000–1800
cm–1 Raman shift range are distinguishable in the
simulated spectra on the basis of the edge structure (Figure S3), only spectra in this range were analyzed
in detail (Figure 5 and Movies).

Figure 5 Simulated Raman spectra of the chain-shaped GNRs with zigzag and
armchair edges shown in Figure 1b: (a) zigzag edges and (b) armchair edges.

Several peaks originating from C–H and C–C
vibrations
are evident in the spectra of the chain structures with zigzag edges
(Figure 5a). In particular,
the intensities of the peaks at 1161 and 1180 cm–1 that originate from C–H bending vibrations on zigzag edges
in the Raman spectrum of Z4 were observed to increase with increasing
number of zigzag edges (Figure 5a and Movies). Weak peaks at 1206 cm–1, which correspond
to C–H vibrations on armchair edges, are observed in the spectra
of the chain structures with armchair edges (Figure 5b and Movies), which are also evident in the experimental
spectra of tetracene and chrysene (Figure 4); these peaks are weak because of steric
barriers that hinder C–H vibrations along the armchair edges,
as shown in the molecular structure in Figure 5b. These results reveal that C–H vibrations
correspond to strong peaks when the C–H units are present on
zigzag edges (Figure 4). The peak at 1350 cm–1 was intense (rather than
that associated with C–H vibrations) in the spectra of chain
structures with armchair edges (Figures 1a and 5b);25,33−35 this peak corresponds to C–C stretching vibrations
in chain structures with armchair edges (Figure 5b and Movies) and is referred to as the “D band.”
These spectra reveal that the zigzag and armchair edges in the chain
structures are distinguishable by Raman spectroscopy as well as XPS.

Peaks that correspond to C–H and C–C vibrations are
more apparent in the Raman spectra of the planar structures based
on Z8 (Figures 1c and 6a) and A8 (Figures 1c and 6b) than those in the
spectra of the corresponding chain structures, which is ascribable
to their more complicated structures. Among the various peaks, the
ratio of zigzag to armchair edges was determined using two peaks,
one that corresponds to C–H vibrations on zigzag edges and
the other that corresponds to C–C stretching vibrations, as
well as Raman analysis for chain structures. Other vibrational modes
are listed in the Movie in the Supporting
Information. Peaks at ∼1150 cm–1 that correspond
to C–H bending on zigzag edges are evident in the spectra of
the planar structures based on Z8, such as Z8, Z8-A2, Z8-A4, Z8-A6,
and Z8-A8 (Figure 6a), as well as structures based on A8, such as A8-Z4, Z8-Z6, and
A8-Z8 (Figure 6b).
Although the position of this peak was not very sensitive to the structure,
the peak due to C–C stretching was dramatically affected; for
example, the C–C peak at 1350 cm–1 in the
spectra of the chain structures with armchair edges (Figure 5b) did not appear at that position
in the planar structures based on Z8 (Figures 1c and 6a) and A8 (Figures 1c and 6b). This observation is ascribable to C–C structures
that change with the changing basal plane structure, whereas the C–H-edge
structures are unaffected by changes in the structure of the basal
plane.

edges shown in Figure 1c. Planar structures based on (a) Z8 and (b) A8. (c) Values of G–/G+. (d) Simulated Raman spectra of Z8-A2
and A8-Z2.

The G band is considered to be
a typical peak in the Raman spectrum
of a nanocarbon material, and it is divided into G– and G+ bands for carbon nanotubes, depending on the structure
of the nanotube. Similar separation of G– and G+ bands in the Raman spectra of zigzag GNRs has also been reported.41 The G– band and G+ bands originate from the zigzag edges and the basal plane of zigzag
GNRs, respectively, and the I(G+)/I(G–) ratio [here, I(G+) and I(G–) represent the
intensities of the G– and G+ bands, respectively]
increases with increasing width of zigzag GNRs. We also observed a
similar phenomenon in the spectra of the planar structures based on
Z8 and A8 (Figure 6); a G– band was observed in Z8, whereas the intensity
of the G+ band increased with increasing number of armchair
edges (Figure 6a,c).
In contrast, the intensity of the G– band increased
with increasing number of zigzag edges in A8 (Figure 6b,c). Clearly, the spectra of Z8-A2 (zigzag/armchair
= 4:1) and A8-Z2 (zigzag/armchair = 1:4) can be used to distinguish
these structures by determining the presence or absence of G– or G+ bands (Figure 6d). Moreover, these structures can also be distinguished
by the presence of the peak corresponding to C–H vibrations
in zigzag edges (Figure 6d). A peak at 1145 cm–1 was observed in the spectrum
of Z8-A2, but this peak was absent in the spectrum of A8-Z2, which
indicates that the structures of normally synthesized GNRs can also
be determined by Raman spectroscopy because the ratio of zigzag to
armchair edges in normally synthesized GNRs is usually greater than
4 or less than 0.25.

Conclusions
We investigated GNRs
with zigzag and armchair edges using XPS and
Raman spectroscopy by first examining chain-shaped GNRs with only
zigzag or armchair edges. The difference between the C 1s binding
energies of tetracene and chrysene was determined by XPS to be 0.6
eV, whereas that between GNRs with zigzag edges and armchair edges
was higher, at 0.8 eV. Raman spectroscopy revealed that a strong peak
at ∼1170 cm–1, which corresponds to C–H
bending vibrations on zigzag edges, appeared in the spectra of GNRs
with zigzag edges; however this peak was absent in the spectra of
GNRs with armchair edges. Instead, a strong peak at ∼1350 cm–1 corresponding to C–C stretching vibrations
was observed in the spectra of GNRs with armchair edges. These results
indicate that the zigzag and armchair edges in chain structures are
distinguishable by XPS and Raman spectroscopy. On the basis of the
analyses of the spectra of chain-shaped GNRs, the spectra of planar
GNRs with zigzag and armchair edges were estimated. XPS revealed that
the difference in the C 1s binding energies of zigzag-rich GNRs (zigzag/armchair
= 4:1) and armchair-rich GNRs (zigzag/armchair = 1:4) is 0.5 eV, which
indicates that these peaks are spectrally distinguishable. The zigzag-rich
(zigzag/armchair = 4:1) and armchair-rich (zigzag/armchair = 1:4)
GNRs could also be distinguished by Raman spectroscopy by determining
the presence of G– or G+ bands as well
as peaks that correspond to C–H vibrations on zigzag edges.
These results indicate that planar GNRs can also be distinguished
by XPS and Raman spectroscopy depending on the ratio of zigzag to
armchair edges. This improved understanding of the XPS and Raman spectroscopy
of GNRs with zigzag and armchair edges may lead to the structural
optimization of GNRs for nanosized electronic device applications.

Experimental
Section
Experimental Spectroscopy
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
viz., tetracene (98%, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), chrysene
(98%, Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd.), and HOPG (SPI-1 Grade, SPI Supplies),
were analyzed by XPS and Raman spectroscopy. To avoid sample oxidation,
the spectra were acquired soon after opening the purchased sample
bottles.

XPS (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.)
was conducted at a pass energy of 10 eV using an Al Kα X-ray
gun at 10 mA and 15 kV. Each sample was placed on a conductive copper
tape and then pressed. A flood gun was used to neutralize the charge.
The C 1s signals in each spectrum were normalized against the signal
of highest intensity. Raman spectroscopy (NRS 3200, JASCO Corp.) was
conducted using a Raman spectrometer equipped with a CCD detector
cooled with a Peltier-type cooling system. The 785 nm line of a ∼40
mW Nd/YAG laser was used for Raman excitation.

Computational Spectroscopy
Tetracene with zigzag edges
and chrysene with armchair edges were used as the initial structures
in this study (Figure 1a). To determine the spectral differences between zigzag and armchair
edges, we built chain structures with zigzag and armchair edges, as
shown in Figure 1b.
The ground-state geometry was fully optimized on the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)
level in the gas phase. From the optimized geometry, the vertical
singlet–singlet electronic transition energies were calculated
via the time-dependent DFT method. XPS spectra were simulated using
population analyses performed on the B3LYP/6-31g(d) level to calculate
the electronic energy levels; detailed procedures are provided in
the Supporting Information and other papers.20−22,42 Raman spectra were generated
from the optimized structures by vibrational frequency calculations.
All B3LYP/6-31g(d)-calculated frequencies were scaled by 0.96. The
Gaussian 0943 quantum chemistry software
package was used for all calculations.
