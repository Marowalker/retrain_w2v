Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels have found various uses
in fundamental polymer and colloid science as well as in different
applications. They are conveniently prepared by precipitation polymerization.
In this reaction, radical polymerization and colloidal stabilization
interact with each other to produce well-defined thermosensitive particles
of narrow size distribution. However, the underlying mechanism of
precipitation polymerization has not been fully understood. In particular,
the crucial early stages of microgel formation have been poorly investigated
so far. In this contribution, we have used small-angle neutron scattering
in conjunction with a stopped-flow device to monitor the particle
growth during precipitation polymerization in situ. The average particle
volume growth is found to follow pseudo-first order kinetics, indicating
that the polymerization rate is determined by the availability of
the unreacted monomer, as the initiator concentration does not change
considerably during the reaction. This is confirmed by calorimetric
investigation of the polymerization process. Peroxide initiator-induced
self-crosslinking of N-isopropylacrylamide and the
use of the bifunctional crosslinker N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide are shown to decrease the particle
number density in the batch. The results of the in situ small-angle
neutron scattering measurements indicate that the particles form at
an early stage in the reaction and their number density remains approximately
the same thereafter. The overall reaction rate is found to be sensitive
to monomer and initiator concentration in accordance with a radical
solution polymerization mechanism, supporting the results from our
earlier studies.

1 Introduction
Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)1 (PNIPAM)
is the most commonly used stimuli-sensitive smart polymer, characterized
by its well-defined lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of
approximately 32 °C2 in water. Radical
polymerization of aqueous N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM)
solution above the LCST yields soft colloidal particles in the size
range of tens of nanometers3 to a few microns.4 These so-called microgels5−7 exhibit a volume
phase transition (VPT) at the LCST of PNIPAM and have found various
uses, for instance as emulsion stabilizers,8−11 in membranes,12−14 for photonics,15,16 as drug carriers,17−19 and in bioapplications.20−26

Microgels of narrow size distribution are formed during precipitation
polymerization of NIPAM.27,28 The narrow size distribution
of these particles, which is also achieved in semibatch and continuous
polymerization processes,29,30 suggests that particle
nucleation takes place shortly after initiation and the number of
particles remains approximately constant thereafter. This has been
attributed to electrostatic stabilization by charged persulfate initiator
fragments, which accumulate on the particles as a part of the radical
polymerization process.31 The reaction-condition-dependent
chain length has been proposed as the regulating mechanism for the
number of stabilizing initiator fragments in the particles.32,33 Recently, it has been shown that the principles of radical solution
polymerization can be effectively used to regulate the stabilization
and final particle volume of PNIPAM particles.34,35

All these conclusions have been drawn indirectly by investigating
the resulting microgel properties. However, to fully understand the
formation mechanism of microgels during precipitation polymerization,
the early stages of the reaction have to be investigated directly.
But, the rapid growth of particles at typical reaction conditions36 makes the characterization of microgel formation
and growth difficult. So far, the investigation of microgel growth
has been limited to ex situ experiments, where samples were taken
from a batch reactor during polymerization and investigated using
dynamic light scattering (DLS).37 This
approach faces the problem that the polymerization process might be
disturbed by taking samples out of the batch reactor and the necessity
to quench the sample before investigation. Furthermore, this process
is time consuming and only a limited amount of samples can be taken
at a specific time. Using in situ three-dimensional (3D) DLS, we could
monitor the particle growth during the precipitation polymerization
of NIPAM under non-stirred conditions.36 The groups of Wu and Jiang performed similar investigations in two-dimensional
DLS for the synthesis of hydroxypropyl cellulose–poly(acrylic
acid) and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) microgels.38,39 In a more recent work, we developed a DLS probe with an automated
probe head, allowing the investigation of microgel formation in situ
in a batch reactor under stirred conditions.40 While these setups allowed the undisturbed investigation of particle
growth, the temporal resolution was limited to 90 s (3D DLS) respectively
30 s (2D DLS) intervals, preventing the investigation of early stages
of the reaction.

The combination of small-angle scattering and
stopped-flow techniques allows investigating temporal changes in colloidal
systems with great precision.41−43 In this work, we employ in situ
small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to investigate the effects of
monomer, initiator, and crosslinker concentration on the growth of
PNIPAM microgels in their native, undisturbed environment with a high
temporal resolution of 5 s. High flux SANS in combination with a stopped-flow
device for controlled initiation is found to be an ideal tool to track
particle and population properties in situ. Combining these techniques,
it is possible to investigate the precipitation polymerization of
NIPAM in more detail than with previous analytical methods. Understanding
the precipitation polymerization in detail is of fundamental interest
to polymer chemists and physicists and helps in improving the synthesis
methods to customize the smart particles for their numerous applications.

2 Model Expression for the Scattered Intensity
To investigate
the effect of monomer, initiator, and crosslinker concentration on
microgel formation during the precipitation polymerization of PNIPAM
microgels, SANS spectra were taken during polymerization (details
of the SANS measurements can be found in the Experimental
Section). These spectra are fitted with models described in
this section to gain information on the particle volumes and numbers
over the course of the polymerization.

In a SANS experiment,
the average scattered intensity I(q) from a dispersion of particles is proportional to the structure
factor S(q) and form factor P(q), where q = (4π/λ)
× sin(θ/2) denotes the magnitude of the momentum transfer
with wavelength λ and scattering angle θ.27 1  P(q) contains spatially averaged information on the geometry and internal
structure of the scatterers; S(q) contributes to the intensity only when the particle positions are
correlated. If the interparticle interactions are weak or the dispersion
is sufficiently dilute, particle positions in the scattering volume
are uncorrelated and S(q) →
1. We shall see that this is the case in the current work (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Form factors at various
reaction times during precipitation polymerization of NIPAM at 65
°C. Solid lines denote the model expression with instrumental
smearing. The dashed line shows the model expression without instrumental
smearing. The dotted line demonstrates that the scattered intensity
decays faster than q–3. Datasets
are arbitrarily scaled for clear presentation. NIPAM concentration
was 2.00 × 10–2 mol dm–3,
ammoniumpersulfate (APS) and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine
(TEMED) concentrations were 1.56 × 10–3 and
1.56 × 10–3 mol dm–3, respectively.

For a collection of np particles dispersed in scattering volume Vsc at nominal scattering vector magnitude q̅, the average scattered intensity is given by 2  In this expression, Δρ
is the scattering contrast between the continuous phase and the particles,
Res(q̅, q, σ) is the
instrument resolution function, RDF(R, σp) is the particle radius distribution function, and V(R) is the scattering weight of the particle
fraction with radius R. The resolution function can
be described by44,45 3  Here
σ is the smearing parameter for q̅, which
accounts for the instrument collimation configuration, beam wavelength
spread, apertures, and detector pixel size. I0(x) is the modified Bessel function of the
first kind. Pedersen45 notes that 10 point
discretization is sufficient for the calculation of the resolution
function. The same discretization was used here.

As the polymerization
takes place at a temperature of 65 °C, far above the volume phase
transition temperature (VPTT) of PNIPAM, the PNIPAM particles are
in a collapsed state. Collapsed PNIPAM particles can be approximated
as homogeneous spheres,27 adequately described
by the hard sphere form factor 4  with the scattering weight of a homogenous
sphere given by 5  Assuming the particle weight and
volume to be distributed according to the normal distribution, it
follows that 6  where g(V, σp) is the Gaussian
distribution with respect to the particle volume and σp is the polydispersity index, i.e., standard deviation of the distribution
divided by its mean. Discretization of 50 points was used in the numerical
calculation of the integral over the distribution.

The number
of particles formed during the early reaction nucleation period determines
the final particle volume of the microgels.36 Particle nuclei are formed in the early stages of polymerization,
probably by a combination of aggregation of precursor particles and
adsorption of oligo- and monomers onto precursor particles. After
a certain point, these particles are being electrostatically stabilized
by the charged initiator fragments, preventing further aggregation
of particles.31 From this point on, the
number of particles remains fixed. A model-independent method to approximate
the particle number density is the Porod invariant (Q),46 which is related to the volume fractions
of the polymer and heavy water phases in the scattering volume 7  where Φ is the volume
fraction of polymer in the particle. The unsmeared model expression I(q) was used to calculate the integral.
During the reaction, the collapsed polymer is located in particles
with average volume  and therefore the volume
fraction of polymer in the scattering volume Vsc is given by 8  where Φp is the polymer volume
fraction inside the particles, here taken as 0.42 for collapsed PNIPAM
microgels.27 The time evolution of the
number of particles in the scattering volume can be then approximated
by rearranging eq 8 into 9  

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Validity of the Model Expression
Typical data from in situ stopped-flow polymerization at various
reaction times is shown in Figure 1. After initiation of the polymerization in the mixer
chamber, the reaction mixture is rapidly directed to the observation
cuvette, where it remains stationary during the reaction. The early
reaction time scattering pattern is typically flat, except for a sharp
upturn at the low q region. Strong forward scattering
indicates the presence of large structures. The origin of this phenomenon
is likely due to small argon bubbles from mixing, as any polymer structures
present at the early reaction stage are expected to be small. With
increasing reaction time, scattering from growing polymer particles
begins to dominate the scattered intensity. This is seen from the
emergence of a form factor minimum, which shifts to smaller q values with increasing particle size.

Solid lines
in Figure 1 denote
the model expression, eq 2, fitted to the data points. Generally, the model captures well the
data features, confirming that collapsed PNIPAM particles can be treated
as homogeneous spheres. A homogeneous structure is to be expected
as the thermal blobs of a polymer in a poor solvent, such as PNIPAM
at temperatures above the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT)
in D2O, pack densely together to minimize the surface area
with the solvent.47 For reference, the
dotted line above the upmost form factor shows the unsmeared scattering
pattern without instrumental effects.

The calculation of the
Porod invariant imposes certain requirements for the system under
investigation.46 The experimental intensity
should not exhibit a strong upturn as q →
0, which is typical for aggregated systems. In addition, the scattering
intensity has to decay faster than q–3. In our experiment, smooth behavior and good model fit in the low q regime of the experimental data indicate that no aggregation
of particles takes place during polymerization. Aggregation would
be observed as intensified forward scattering and/or a kink in the
low q regime due to correlation of particle positions
in a small aggregate, in analogy to the structure factor. In fact,
the data show no evidence of a structure factor contribution in the
experimentally accessible q range, which indicates
dilute dispersion and/or weak interactions between the particles.
The model used here would not be able to describe these features if
they were present, leading to a poor fit. Comparing experimental data
to the dotted line shows that the experimental data decay faster than q–3, fulfilling the other requirement.

3.2 Particle Growth Follows Pseudo-First-Order Kinetics
Monomer and initiator concentration have considerable effects on
the final particle volume of PNIPAM microgels, which exhibits power
law behavior with respect to both of these reactants.34,35 In situ 3D dynamic light scattering experiments have shown the average
growth rate of the particles to increase with both the monomer and
initiator concentration.36Figure 2A confirms that the average
volume growth rate and final particle volume are strongly influenced
by the initial monomer concentration. Identically colored traces denote
measurement repetition under identical reaction conditions. Slightly
variable induction periods were observed for the repeated measurements,
presumably caused by trace amounts of oxygen in the instrument. Due
to this, all traces shown in Figure 2 are shifted to zero reaction time to compensate for
the inhibitory effect of the oxygen and allow for a better comparison
of reactions repeated at the same reaction conditions. The experiment
is found to be most reproducible at the lowest monomer concentration
of 2.0 × 10–2 mol dm–3. In
contrast, experiments with the higher monomer concentration show more
variation with respect to the final particle volume. The high initial
volumes with large uncertainty possibly arise from microbubbles as
discussed in the context of Figure 1.

Figure 2 Average particle volume with reaction time at 65 °C.
Repetitions under the same reaction conditions are denoted by the
color scheme. Slight shifts in the traces due to inhibitory effects
of oxygen were compensated by shifting the traces to zero reaction
time for clear presentation. (A) At various NIPAM concentrations.
APS and TEMED were used as redox initiation system. Their concentrations
were 1.56 × 10–3 and 1.56 × 10–3 mol dm–3, respectively. Solid lines are fits to eq 11. (B) At various APS
concentrations. APS was solely used to initiate the reaction. NIPAM
concentration was 3.65 × 10–2 mol dm–3. Solid lines are linear fits.

PNIPAM microgels typically have a narrow size distribution,27,28 which implies a short particle nucleation phase at the beginning
of the reaction and subsequent particle growth. If new particles would
be formed in later stages of the reaction, broadening of the particle
size distribution would be expected, as new particle nuclei would
form alongside the already growing microgel particles. These new particles
would either form new microgels, increasing the number of particles
during the polymerization, or aggregate onto existing microgel particles.
In either case, it would cause an increase in particle size distribution
that does not fit to the observed narrow size distribution for PNIPAM.
If no particle aggregation takes place during the polymerization,
the time evolution of the average particle volume during the reaction
can be assumed as follows 10  where VM is the
volume of the collapsed polymer, including water,48 polymerized from one mole of NIPAM, np is the number of particles in the batch, and Rp is the rate of monomer consumption. The experimentally
observed particle growth in Figure 2A could be well described with an equation of the form 11  where τ
is the time constant of the reaction. Single exponential behavior
implies that the particle growth rate depends only on monomer concentration,
indicating pseudo-first-order kinetics for polymerization. Furthermore,
the observed behavior requires the particle concentration to remain
approximately constant throughout the growth phase. Similar results
have been reported by Wu et al. for poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate
(PEGDMA) nanogels crosslinked with divinylbenzene.39

Pseudo-first-order behavior can take place if the
initiator concentration does not change considerably during the reaction
due to the long half-life time of the initiator. Under these conditions,
the initiator concentration can be assumed to be constant so that
the reaction kinetics depend only on the monomer concentration.49 Polymerization was initiated with an APS–TEMED
system to minimize the effects of oxygen in the stopped-flow instrument.
Peroxide–amine redox initiation is typically 1–3 orders
of magnitude faster than the corresponding peroxide without the accelerator50 and rapidly consumes any trace amounts of oxygen
in the stopped-flow cuvette. Assuming that the rate constant for the
redox reaction is of the order of 1.2 × 10–2 dm3 mol–1 s–1,50 the half-lives of the redox components are approximately
14 h, given that the concentration of 1.56 × 10–3 mol dm–3 is used for both APS and TEMED. The volume
traces in Figure 2A
approach a plateau after 20 min of reaction time, showing that the
time necessary to approach full conversion is short in comparison
with the initiator half-life. This result supports the notion that
the pseudo-first-order kinetics arise from negligible initiator consumption.

Particle growth traces for pure APS initiation without the accelerator
TEMED are shown in Figure 2B. These syntheses were performed without TEMED to investigate
the influence of initiator concentration on particle growth while
simultaneously investigating the effect of initiator-induced self-crosslinking
of NIPAM on particle number density (Figure 3). Although TEMED was used during precipitation
polymerization at varying monomer concentrations (Figure 2A), it should not strongly
affect the results in comparison to the effect of initiator concentration
(Figure 2B), as radical
initiators were used in both cases.

Figure 3 Number of particles with reaction time,
averaged over repetitions. (A) At various NIPAM concentrations. APS
and TEMED concentrations were 1.56 × 10–3 and
1.56 × 10–3 mol dm–3, respectively.
Solid lines are fits to eq 11. (B) At various APS concentrations. No TEMED was used in
these syntheses. NIPAM concentration was 3.65 × 10–2 mol dm–3.

Long and variable induction periods were observed with the
thermally decomposing initiator. The instrument was always flushed
with argon-purged D2O to remove oxygen from the system
prior to loading the deoxygenized reactants to the stopped-flow device.
Despite intensive flushing, trace amounts of oxygen in the instrument
are the most likely explanation for the initial inhibition of the
reaction.

The reaction rate was significantly reduced without
the accelerator TEMED, which is seen from the fact the particle volume
trace does not level off in a comparable polymerization time frame
as in Figure 2A. The
initial particle growth regime appears to be linear for all except
the highest APS concentration of 9.6 × 10–3 mol dm–3. The same behavior has been reported
earlier for in situ 3D DLS measurements using potassium persulfate
(KPS) as the initiator.36 The traces in Figure 2B were fitted with
a linear model. For the highest APS concentration, the fit was limited
to the linear section of the trace.

3.3 Evolution
of Particle Number Density with Reaction Time
The number
of particles with reaction time was calculated from eq 9 for batches with variable NIPAM
and APS concentration, shown in Figure 3A,B, respectively. In all cases, the number of particles
in the scattering volume approaches a plateau, confirming that the
particle number density remains approximately constant throughout
the reaction. The apparent particle number in scattering volume is
also affected by possible sedimentation of particles and convection
due to temperature gradients in the stopped-flow instrument. Given
the scattering volume of 4.8 × 10–5 dm3, all particle concentrations in this work settle in the range
of 1015–1016 dm–3,
which is compatible with values of 1015–1017 dm–3 reported earlier by Wu et al.31

For three different NIPAM concentrations
in Figure 3, the final
particle concentration varies in a nonlinear way. This is consistent
with earlier findings which indirectly showed that the particle concentration
at the end of the reaction (np) depends
on the initial NIPAM concentration in the batch. In a series of batches
with increasing NIPAM concentration, the end particle concentration
first increases, goes through a maximum, and then decreases.34,35

Peroxide initiators (used without accelerator) are known to
induce crosslinking of PNIPAM chains to the extent that microgels
are formed even without an additional crosslinker.32,33 Recently, we have shown that the crosslinks concentrate at the particle
periphery, leading to an inverted crosslinking structure in comparison
to conventional PNIPAM microgels.28 The
particle volume in the collapsed state has been shown to increase
with KPS concentration,33,36 which can be attributed
to either decreasing particle concentration or increasing water affinity
of the network due to the increased number of hydrophilic initiator
fragments.

Figure 3B shows a systematically decreasing number of particles in the scattering
volume with increasing APS concentration. If the polymer volume fraction
Φp within the particles decreased due to increased
water affinity, the apparent number of particles should increase according
to eq 9. As the opposite
behavior is observed in Figure 3B, we conclude that the particle number density does indeed
decrease with increasing peroxide initiator concentration. Previous
work has shown that the increased ionic strength due to peroxide initiator
does not significantly promote the coagulation of the nuclei34 and therefore the likely explanation for the
decreased particle density is the increased probability of irreversible
nuclei aggregation due to peroxide-induced self-crosslinking reactions.

3.4 Total Volume Growth Rate is Proportional to the
Polymerization Rate
Rearrangement of eq 10 shows that the total volume growth rate
is proportional to the polymerization rate up to a constant factor VM–1 as 12  Figure 4 shows the total volume growth rate with
NIPAM and APS concentration. The total volume growth rate increases
when both the monomer and initiator concentration in the batch is
increased, being clearly more sensitive to NIPAM concentration in
comparison to APS concentration. Earlier studies have shown the polymerization
rate to be close to the power law behavior of radical solution polymerization
with Rp ∝ [monomer][initiator]1/2 shortly after initiation.35,36 This is not
surprising, given the abundant solubility of NIPAM in water, which
implies that significant conversion takes place in the water phase
during early reaction stages.

Figure 4 Total volume growth rate extrapolated to zero
time in log–log presentation. (A) Plotted against varying NIPAM
concentration. APS and TEMED were used as redox initiation system.
Their concentrations were 1.56 × 10–3 and 1.56
× 10–3 mol dm–3, respectively.
(B) Plotted against varying APS concentration. No TEMED was used in
these syntheses. NIPAM concentration was 3.65 × 10–2 mol dm–3. Solid lines denote linear fit to the
data points.

The power law exponent
with respect to NIPAM concentration, determined here as 1.54 ±
0.07, is higher than expected based on the earlier results of 0.94
± 0.0836 and 1.05 ± 0.08.35 However, given the limited amount of experimental
data, the value is in reasonable agreement with previous work. As
expected for radical solution polymerization, the power law exponent
of 0.42 ± 0.03 in respect to APS concentration is close to half
an order of magnitude lower than for the NIPAM concentration. This
result is in good agreement with earlier results of 0.46 ± 0.0536 and 0.56 ± 0.03.35

3.5 Effect of Crosslinker Bisacrylamide on Particle
Growth Rate and Number Density
N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS) is a typical crosslinker
employed for the synthesis of microgels. Copolymerization with BIS
increases the particle size of microgels in the collapsed state, which
has been documented on multiple occasions.31,33−35Figure 5A shows that even a small addition of BIS to the monomer mixture
has a considerable effect on the average particle growth, leading
to larger final particle volume.

Figure 5 (A) Average particle volume with reaction
time with increasing bisacrylamide concentration. Repetitions with
the same reaction conditions are denoted by the color scheme. Slight
shifts in the traces due to inhibitory effects of oxygen were compensated
by shifting the traces to zero reaction time for clear presentation.
In each batch, NIPAM concentration was 3.65 × 10–2 mol dm–3, APS concentration was 1.56 × 10–3 mol dm–3, and TEMED concentration
was 3.12 × 10–3 mol dm–3.
BIS concentrations are given in the graph. (B) Number of particles
with increasing bisacrylamide concentration.

The low amounts of BIS used in the syntheses do not significantly
alter the water affinity of the network. Therefore, the likely explanation
for the increased particle size is a decrease in the particle number
density. This is confirmed in Figure 5B, which shows the decrease of particle number in the
scattering volume with increasing BIS concentration.

As the
number of particles in the scattering volume remains approximately
constant throughout the reaction, the differences in the number of
particles arise already at the onset of the reaction during the nucleation
phase. Incorporation of bifunctional bisacrylamide units to the nuclei
increase the probability of their irreversible aggregation with each
other, which leads to a decrease in the particle number density.

The effect of BIS on the total volume growth rate of the particles
was calculated from eq 12 (Supporting Information (SI): Figure S1). Even though BIS clearly decreases the number of particles in the
batch, leading to larger final particle volume, the effect on the
reaction rate is less pronounced. Therefore, the reactions were repeated
in a reaction calorimeter. The measured reaction heat is mainly due
to the cleavage of the NIPAM double bonds, which is directly proportional
to the reaction rate. In the resulting calorigrams in Figure 6, a slight influence of BIS
concentration on the reaction rate can be observed. The reaction rate
increases slightly in the reaction beginning with increasing BIS concentration,
resulting in a higher heat output and stronger peak intensity. Still,
the overall duration of the reaction remains the same, as the crosslinker
is consumed faster than NIPAM. Additionally, the total conversion
increases with rising BIS concentration. This can be attributed to
a bigger influence of the crosslinker on the total reaction enthalpy
with increasing BIS concentration.

Figure 6 Calorigrams for PNIPAM microgel syntheses
with increasing BIS concentration. In each batch, the NIPAM concentration
was 3.65 × 10–2 mol dm–3,
APS concentration was 1.56 × 10–3 mol dm–3, and TEMED concentration was 3.12 × 10–3 mol dm–3. BIS concentrations are given in the
graph.

Using the heat of polymerization
of NIPAM, determined to be 84.5 ± 0.3 kJ mol–1 in one of our previous reports,35 it
is possible to calculate the conversion depending on the reaction
time (Figure 7A). Performing
a single exponential fit of the conversion data with eq 11 on the NIPAM synthesis without
BIS shows a good agreement with corresponding fits of the scattering
data (Figure 5). But
as soon as BIS is added to the reaction, the fit shows nonsingle exponential
behavior. This is to be expected, since the reaction proceeds with
copolymerization kinetics as soon as the bifunctional monomer BIS
is added to the reaction. A two exponential equation (SI: eq S1) is used to incorporate those kinetics,
resulting in a better agreement with the experimental data (single
plots can be found in SI Figure S2). Using
these fits, the initial reaction rates (rinitial) can be determined (for details, see SI), showing an increase in the initial reaction rate with increasing
BIS concentration (Figure 7B). These results are in agreement with our earlier findings
by a combination of experimental and simulation results for poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) and PNIPAM microgels.51,52 Furthermore, Wu and Pelton documented similar findings, showing
that the reaction rate of BIS is higher than that of NIPAM.31

Figure 7 (A) Conversion during the precipitation polymerization
of PNIPAM depending on the reaction time, fitted with the single exponential eq 11 and the two exponential eq S1. (B) Initial reaction rates in dependence
of BIS concentration.

In summary, these calorimetry results are in agreement with
the scattering results, confirming that monomer concentration controls
the reaction rate. This effect is less pronounced in the scattering
data, which can be attributed to a higher error in the scattering
experiments.

4 Conclusions
In this
work, we monitored the particle growth in the precipitation polymerization
of N-isopropylacrylamide in situ by small-angle neutron
scattering (SANS). In earlier work, features of the reaction have
been deduced from the properties of the resulting polymer particles;
here, we presented data from direct measurements throughout the evolution
of growing microgels.

The average particle volume growth was
found to adhere to pseudo-first-order kinetics, indicating that the
polymerization rate is dominated by the amount of unreacted monomer
at any given reaction state. Scattering data showed that monomer,
initiator, and crosslinker concentration all affect the particle number
density in the batch, which in turn determines the final particle
volume. Of special note is the effect of crosslinking reactions: both
persulfate initiator-induced crosslinking and the bifunctional monomer
decrease the concentration of particles in the batch, presumably because
of increased probability of irreversible aggregation of particle nuclei
during the nucleation phase.

Spherical particles could be detected
rapidly after the reaction onset, after which the particle concentration
remained approximately constant. The initial polymerization rate deduced
from the total volume growth rate in the reaction was sensitive to
both initiator and monomer concentration, in accordance to the radical
solution mechanism. In case of the crosslinker concentration, the
effect on the initial polymerization rate could not be conclusively
determined using SANS, due to the low amount of crosslinker used for
the polymerization. In combination with calorimetry, however, it could
be shown that the crosslinker has a slight influence on the initial
reaction rate. The in situ measurements presented in this article
not only confirm the earlier studies that relied on indirect measurements
but further solidify our understanding of precipitation polymerization
of thermosensitive polymers.

Finally, we demonstrate that stopped-flow
SANS, in combination with sophisticated automated fitting routines
that allow analyzing large datasets, provides new opportunities to
investigate colloidal systems under nonequilibrium conditions. These
techniques will be developed further by exploring contrast variation
to provide additional detailed information on the structure of complex
colloids.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Small-Angle
Neutron Scattering (SANS)
All in situ measurements were performed
at the small-angle neutron scattering diffractometer KWS-253 at a detector distance of 20 m. The instrument
resolution was determined by a 20% wavelength spread of the neutron
beam. Precipitation polymerization was initiated in a BioLogic SFM-300
stopped-flow device, which was positioned in the neutron beam (Figure 8). SFM-300 was connected
to a Julabo refrigerated circulator set to a temperature of 65 °C.

Figure 8 Experimental
setup of the BioLogic SFM-300 stopped-flow device in the neutron beam.

NIPAM was recrystallized from
hexane; the crosslinker N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide
(BIS), initiator ammoniumpersulfate (APS), and accelerator N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) were used as
received. Separate monomer and initiator solutions of appropriate
concentrations were prepared in heavy water and deoxygenized by purging
with argon. When the accelerator TEMED was used, it was mixed directly
with the monomers. Prior to loading the monomer and initiator into
separate sample chambers of the SFM-300 instrument, the chambers,
channels, mixer, and cuvette were flushed with deoxygenized heavy
water to remove oxygen from the device.

After tempering the
monomer and initiator solutions in the chambers for at least 15 min,
the reaction was initiated by rapidly mixing the monomer and initiator
in 1:1 ratio at 65 °C. The reaction was monitored for minimum
20 min, using 5 s integration time.

Program FitIt!,a was scripted to fit approximately 15 000 datasets
from 3 individual syntheses with the model described in the previous
section.

5.2 Calorimetry
To measure the heat transferred
during the polymerization of NIPAM monomers by the cleavage of the
double bonds, an RC1su reaction calorimeter with a triple-walled 500
mL RTCal glass reactor from Mettler Toledo was used. The measuring
principles have previously been reported in the literature.54,55 The calorimeter was operated in the isothermal mode, meaning that
the reaction temperature Tr was set to
a constant value of 60 °C, whereas the jacket temperature Tj changed automatically to maintain a constant Tr. The enthalpy of polymerization is measured
by monitoring the heat transfer rate between the reaction vessel and
the heating jacket using a thermocouple embedded in the polymer matrix
in the inner glass wall of the jacket. The reaction heat curve is
obtained with a resolution of 2 s between the measurements. The polymerization
was carried out using 300 mL of reaction mixture. NIPAM, BIS, and
TEMED were dissolved in double-distilled water inside the glass reactor,
purged with argon for 30 min, and equilibrated for 30 min under stirring
(100 rpm) to the desired reaction temperature. To initiate the polymerization,
a preheated degassed solution of APS in 2 mL of double-distilled water
was added rapidly through a 3 mL syringe into the reactor.
