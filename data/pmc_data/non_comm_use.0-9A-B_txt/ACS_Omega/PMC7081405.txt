This
study aimed
to develop a highly efficient nanofilter for capturing fine particles
using electrostatic forces. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), a water-soluble
synthetic polymer, was selected as the main component of the filter
because it can be easily fabricated by electrospinning. Titanium dioxide
(TiO2) nanopowder with an anatase structure was applied
to the nanofilters as it has the highest photocatalytic activity among
the existing photocatalysts. PVA nanofilters fabricated by electrospinning
could still be dissolved in water by hydrolysis. Therefore, heat treatment
was performed to make the nanofilters stable, thereby forming C=O
bonds by keto–enol tautomerization. Structural changes in the
PVA nanofilter before and after heat treatment were investigated by
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis.
As the TiO2 concentration increased, the fiber diameter
of the PVA nanofilter decreased and a homogeneous fiber was obtained.
The filtration efficiency and pressure drop also improved significantly,
compared to those of the PVA-only nanofilter. Moreover, we observed
eco-friendly decomposition of the PVA/TiO2 nanofilter into
water and carbon dioxide by a photocatalytic reaction under UV irradiation.

Introduction
In recent years, fine
dust has emerged as a major problem worldwide.
Fine dust is classified into the categories PM2.5 (particle diameter
below 2.5 μm) and PM10 (particle diameter below 10 μm)
according to the particle diameter. Fine dust contains particles of
various pollutants, such as automobile emissions, pollens, and bacteria.1 A major problem is that existing filters for
fine dust are disposed of in landfills or incinerated, which may cause
environmental pollution. To solve this problem, studies on reusable
filters and the use of biopolymers as a filter media have been conducted.
For example, various types of filters that can be reused have been
researched, such as a filter capable of washing the collected pollutants
with water, a filter for burning off the contaminants at a high temperature,
and a filter for cleaning the fine dust using a solvent.2−5 Moreover,
various biopolymers, such as silk, chitosan, and keratin, have been
used to produce filters, either on their own or mixed with synthetic
polymers.6−9 However, reusable filters also have a restriction
on the number of reuse cycles, so they could potentially be disposed
of in the same way as a conventional filter. In addition, they have
disadvantages such as a higher unit cost in the case of biopolymer
filters, and physical properties that are not comparable to those
of synthetic polymers.

Nanofibers present an advantage, as the
filtration efficiency can be further improved compared to conventional
microlevel filters due to their high surface area to volume ratio.
There are various methods for fabricating nanofibers, such as melt-blown,
compound spinning, and electrospinning methods. Among them, electrospinning
is a method for easily producing nanofibers and is thus adopted in
this study. Various polymers have been fabricated and studied as nanofiber
filters through electrospinning.10 Among
them, poly(vinyl alcohol), PVA, is water-soluble and nontoxic and
is commonly used for producing nanofibers by electrospinning.11 It has good elasticity, excellent miscibility
with various polymers, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and
has been used in various research fields.12,13 However,
electrospun PVA fibers are water-soluble, which presents a massive
disadvantage. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted to reduce
their reactivity with water through chemical crosslinking or heat
treatment as a physical method. Studies on chemical crosslinking have
mainly used aldehyde-based crosslinking agents, such as glutaraldehyde
and formaldehyde.14,15 Since these chemical crosslinking
agents may be toxic to humans, heat treatment was used to increase
the crystallinity of PVA to increase water stability.16

There are various types of photocatalysts, such as
titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, cadmium sulfide, and tungsten oxide.
However, zinc oxide and cadmium sulfide decompose into zinc and cadmium,
which are harmful to human beings and the environment after a photocatalytic
reaction, respectively. Thus, these photocatalysts cannot be used
any longer. Tungsten oxide exhibits excellent photoactivity but has
a disadvantage of being responsive to only specific materials. On
the other hand, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely
used in the photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants as
it exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity, high durability,
and low toxicity among the existing photocatalysts.17 Among them, the TiO2 anatase type is the most
widely studied because it has the advantages of excellent photocatalytic
activity, chemical stability, environmental friendliness, and low
cost.18

PVA and TiO2 have
been mixed and applied in various forms. Most studies have focused
on the removal of organic compounds such as dye removal. For example,
removal of methyl orange using a PVA/TiO2 nanocomposite
film and nanofibers, and photocatalytic decomposition of rhodamine
B using nanofibers through electrospinning have been reported.12,19 In addition, there are several research studies on the decomposition
of an aqueous solution of PVA using the photocatalytic activity of
TiO2.20,21 However, most photocatalytic
decompositions of PVA were carried out in aqueous solution, and there
have been few studies on decomposing solid PVA using a photocatalyst
and there have been no reports of applying it to a filter.22,23 For these reasons, we tried to fabricate water-insoluble PVA/TiO2 nanofilters by heat treatment, and the photocatalytic decomposition
behavior of PVA/TiO2 nanofilters was analyzed by UV irradiation.

Results
and Discussion
The morphological
changes of the electrospun nanofibers with changes in the PVA concentration
were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Figure 1). It can be seen
that the shape of the nanofiber changes depending on the concentration
of the PVA solution. Low concentrations of PVA nanofibers contained
beads, resulting in uneven fiber formation. When the concentration
of PVA is more than a certain concentration, it can be seen that the
fibers are not evenly formed. The optimal concentration of the PVA
solution to produce nanofibers with no beads or even fibers was found
to be 13%. Hence, all electrospinning solutions used a 13% PVA solution.

electrospun nanofilters with different PVA concentrations.

PVA nanofilters heat-treated at 155 °C for 5, 10, and
15 min
were confirmed to be water-insoluble. When heat treatment was not
performed, all of them dissolved in water by hydrolysis. However,
when heat treatment was carried out for 5 min, a part of the PVA nanofilter
tended to dissolve in water, and the PVA nanofilters heat-treated
for 10 and 15 min did not dissolve in water at all. In addition, the
PVA nanofilter discolored slightly after heat treatment, as shown
in Figure 2A. Thereafter,
heat treatment of all samples was performed at 155 °C for 10
min. The weight losses of PVA nanofilters at different heat treatment
times were also measured and are listed in Table 1.

The results of the wide-angle X-ray
scattering (WAXS) analysis of PVA nanofilters before and after heat
treatment at different times are shown in Figure 2B. The WAXS pattern interestingly changed
at 2θ = 19.5°, which indicates that heat treatment causes
a change in the crystallinity of PVA nanofilters. The crystallite
size was calculated using the Scherrer equation (eq 1) and is summarized in Table 2.24,25 1  In
the above equation, τ is the average crystallite size to
the peak width in radians, K is the shape constant
near unity, β is the reflection width (full width at half-maximum,
FWHM), θ is Bragg’s angle, and λ is the wavelength
of the applied X-ray source. As the heat treatment time was increased,
it was confirmed that the crystallinity of PVA nanofilters increased,
and as the FWHM also decreased, the crystallite size increased from
1.26 nm for 0 min to 2.38 nm for 15 min after heat treatment. This
increase in the crystallite size was attributed to the removal of
residual water in the PVA nanofilters after electrospinning by heat
treatment. Moreover, the PVA polymer chain was regularly oriented
in a certain direction, which contributed to the formation of additional
crystal structures.

The
Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis results used to observe
the change in the chemical structure of the PVA nanofilter after heat
treatment at 155 °C for 10 min is shown in Figure S1. A new peak around 1142 cm–1 was
observed. Crystallization has also been reported to be associated
with the changes in the chemical structure.26−28 A peak was
observed near 1430 cm–1, which is attributed to
CH2 bonds, and it was confirmed
that it remained virtually unchanged even after heat treatment. After
heat treatment, a weak peak appeared at 1560 cm–1, which is due to the formation of a new C=O group during
the heat treatment process. The new C=O bond is formed by the
keto–enol tautomerization reaction, as shown in the reaction
in Scheme S2, and appears to be in the
keto form because, according to Erlenmeyers’ law, the keto
form is generally more stable than the enol tautomer form.29,30

The change in the filtration efficiency of the PVA nanofilter
with changing electrospinning times is shown in Figure 3. The filtration efficiency tended to increase
as the electrospinning time increased, and is given by eq 2(31) 2  where Nup and Ndown are the number of particles upstream and
downstream, respectively. For the PVA nanofilters with a short electrospinning
time (less than 3 h), the NaCl test particles were not collected properly
due to the pores in the PVA nanofilters. The reason for the increase
in the filtration efficiency of PVA nanofilters with an electrospinning
time over 3 h is that the PVA nanofilter layer thickens and the amount
of PVA nanofibers capable of trapping NaCl particles increases. The
pressure drop also tends to increase with the electrospinning time,
which appears to increase with the increasing friction between the
injected fluid and the PVA nanofibers. The pressure drop is the pressure
difference between the inlet and outlet of the fluid. The pressure
drop was also measured as shown in Figure 4 and calculated using the cake filter equation32 3  where
ΔP is the pressure drop, V̇ is the flow rate,
μ is the viscosity of the
fluid, αH is the average specific filter cake resistance
value, KH is the influence of the concentration
and cake porosity, A̅ is the averaged particle
deposition area of the filtration, and β is the resistance of
the filter medium. The PVA nanofilter with an electrospinning time
of 7 h showed a higher filtration efficiency (88.61%) compared to
the PVA nanofilter with an electrospinning time of 6 h. The performance
of a filter is known to be higher when the pressure drop of the filter
is lower and the filtration efficiency is higher.33 Therefore, PVA/TiO2 nanofilters were fabricated
using a PVA nanofilter that underwent 6 h of electrospinning. The
thickness of the PVA nanofilter was measured and is listed in Table S2; the thickness is proportional to the
electrospinning time of the PVA solution. Therefore, the filtration
efficiency followed the same trend with the electrospinning time.

Figure 4 FE-SEM images
of PVA/TiO2 nanofilters with different TiO2 concentrations.

The morphological changes in PVA/TiO2 nanofilters due
to changes in the TiO2 concentration were observed in FE-SEM
images, as shown in Figure 4. As the TiO2 concentration increased, the fiber
diameter tended to decrease (Table S3).
In addition, it was also observed that TiO2 agglomerated
on the fiber surface as the TiO2 concentration increased.
Generally, the viscosity of the electrospinning solution is one of
the important factors affecting the shape and diameter of the nanofibers.34 It is known that a thinner fiber is formed as
the viscosity of the solution decreases. For example, a fiber diameter
of approximately 60 nm was obtained at a viscosity of ∼0.04
Pa·s, whereas that of approximately 1000 nm was obtained at a
viscosity of ∼6–7 Pa·s.35,36 The
viscosities of the electrospinning solutions of P6 and P6T10 are shown
in Figure S2. The addition of TiO2 particles reduced the viscosity of PVA electrospinning solution
and thus fibers with a thinner diameter than PVA-only fibers could
be formed. As the fiber diameter decreased, the specific surface area
relatively increased. Therefore, the PVA/TiO2 nanofilter
proved to be more advantageous as filters for capturing fine particles.

The results of the WAXS analysis for P6 and P6T10 are shown in Figure 5A. A new peak was
investigated at 2θ = 26° in the XRD pattern of P6T10. This
peak is a crystal peak of TiO2 anatase, and it can be seen
that TiO2 particles were well mixed and dispersed in the
PVA nanofilters. In addition, as the FWHM decreased, the crystallite
size of P6T10 slightly increased than that of P6 and the crystallization
also increased (Table 3).

(B) filtration efficiency and pressure drop

The filtration efficiency of the PVA/TiO2 nanofilter
is summarized in Figure 5B. After the automated filter test, the NaCl particles collected
on the P6 and PVA/TiO2 nanofilters were observed by FE-SEM
as shown in Figure S3. It can be confirmed
that the nanofilters containing TiO2 particles have a higher
filtration efficiency and a lower pressure drop than PVA-only nanofilters.
This is related to the aforementioned fiber diameters, and as the
fiber diameters decrease, the ratio of the surface area to volume
increases and the pore size of the fiber decreases. Hence, the NaCl
particles were collected more effectively and the pressure drop was
reduced. In addition, the dispersity of the fiber diameter became
narrow as TiO2 was added, as confirmed in Table S3. The homogeneous distribution of the fiber diameters
influenced the improvement of the filtration efficiency and the decrease
of the pressure drop. There was no major difference between the filtration
efficiency and the pressure drop between PVA/TiO2 nanofilters.
We concluded that the fiber diameter no longer affects the filtration
efficiency and the pressure drop when it is less than a certain value.

The weight losses of PVA/TiO2 nanofilters due to UV
irradiation are shown in Figure 6A and Table S4. As the UV
irradiation time and the TiO2 concentration increased,
the weight loss of the PVA/TiO2 nanofilter due to the photocatalytic
reaction between PVA and TiO2 increased. The photocatalytic
mechanism between PVA and TiO2 is shown in Scheme S3 and eqs 4–9.21,23 4   5   6   7   8   9  The reaction
is initiated when UV irradiation
with an energy higher than the band gap of TiO2 is absorbed
on the TiO2 particles to produce electrons (eCB–)
in the conduction band (CV) and holes (hVB+) in the valence
band (VB) pair. The electrons produced react with the oxygen in air
to produce hydroxide ions, and the holes react with the PVA chain
to produce radicals in the PVA chain. Through successive reactions,
the PVA chain eventually decomposes into CO2 and H2O as final products. When the UV irradiation time was 9 days,
P6T10 showed a remarkably high photocatalytic decomposition efficiency
with a 72.11 ± 4.44% weight loss. On the other hand, in the case
of P6, no photocatalytic decomposition by UV irradiation occurred.

images of P6 and P6T10 nanofilters at different UV irradiation times

images of PVA and PVA/TiO2 nanofilters at different UV
irradiation times.

The digital images of
PVA and PVA/TiO2 nanofilters decomposed
by the photocatalytic reaction under UV irradiation are shown in Figure 6B. P6 retained its
original form even after 9 days of UV irradiation, whereas P6T10 showed
that the nanofilter was decomposed enough for the decomposition to
be visually confirmed after 9 days of UV irradiation.

The morphological
changes of a series of PVA and PVA/TiO2 nanofilters with
the UV irradiation time are shown in Figure 6C. P6 seemed to exhibit no changes in the
fiber shape and diameters. P6T2.5 and P6T5 showed pores under UV irradiation
after 9 days due to photocatalytic decomposition. P6T7.5 and P6T10,
which exhibited higher photocatalytic decomposition, showed that most
of the fibers were broken and did not maintain the filter structures
after 6 days. In addition, P6T7.5 and P6T10 also showed more agglomerates,
owing to the photocatalytic decomposition of the PVA fiber, and PVA
decomposition seemed to be accelerated.

FT-IR spectra of PVA/TiO2 nanofilters with different TiO2 concentrations
and UV irradiation times are shown in Figure 7. In the case of P6, the peak around 1560
cm–1 does not disappear but it disappeared after
9 days of UV irradiation for PVA/TiO2 nanofilters, according
to Figure S4. Thus, it was confirmed that
the PVA chain decomposed into CO2 by photocatalytic decomposition
with TiO2 following eqs 5–10. Interestingly, for
P6T10, this peak quickly disappeared after 3 days of UV irradiation.

Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was purchased from
Duksan Pure Chemistry (average Mw = 66 000).
TiO2 nanopowder with a particle size of 18 nm was purchased
from US Research Nanomaterials.

Preparation
of PVA/TiO2 Nanofilters
The fabrication process
of a series of PVA/TiO2 nanofilters is shown in Scheme 1. PVA was dissolved
in distilled water at 80 °C for 2 h to prepare PVA solutions
having concentrations of 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15%. The prepared
solution was placed in a 10 mL syringe, and four syringes were mounted
on an electrospinning device to perform electrospinning. The voltage
was maintained at 20 kV, the diameter of the syringe nozzle was 22
gauge, the tip-to-collector distance was 30 cm, the solution discharge
rate was 0.3 mL/h, and the collector rotation speed was 100 rpm. The
temperature and humidity were maintained at 25 °C and 43% with
a thermo-hygrostat, and electrospinning was performed for an hour.
An aluminum window screen serving as a support for the filter was
fixed to the collector. After confirming the proper concentration
of the PVA solution, the PVA solution was electrospun from 1 to 7
h under the above conditions to confirm the optimal electrospinning
time to fabricate the PVA filters. In the case of PVA/TiO2 nanofilters with different TiO2 concentrations, however,
the electrospinning process of the PVA/TiO2 solution was
performed for 6 h under the same spinning conditions. The fabricated
PVA/TiO2 nanofilters and their compositions are denoted
as PxTy according
to the electrospinning time and the TiO2 concentration
and are listed in Table 4.

Heat Treatment of PVA/TiO2 Nanofilters
To
prevent
the electrospun PVA and PVA/TiO2 nanofilters from dissolving
in water, additional heat treatment
was performed in a vacuum dryer at 155 °C for 5, 10, and 15 min,
respectively.

Characterization
The change in the
morphological structure of PVA nanofilters due
to the PVA concentration, the average diameter of the electrospun
PVA/TiO2 nanofiber and NaCl particles collected on the
PVA and PVA/TiO2 nanofilters, as well as the change in
the morphological structure of PVA and PVA/TiO2 nanofilters
after photocatalytic decomposition were confirmed by field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, SUPRA 55VP, Carl Zeiss, Germany).
The changes in the crystal structure of PVA nanofilters that underwent
heat treatment and PVA nanofilters with different TiO2 concentrations
were analyzed using a wide-angle X-ray scattering system (WAXS, D8
Discover, Bruker, Germany). The change in the chemical structure of
PVA nanofilters after heat treatment, photocatalytic decomposition
behavior, and decomposed products formed under UV irradiation were
investigated using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR,
Nicolet iS5, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the range of 400–4000
cm–1. The changes in the viscosity of the electrospinning
PVA solutions with different TiO2 concentrations were determined
using a rheometer (MARS III, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Filtration
Test
The filtration efficiency
and pressure drop of PVA and PVA/TiO2 nanofilters were
measured using an automated filter tester (8310A, TSI Inc.) at a concentration
of 8 ± 4 mg/m3, a flow rate of 95 L/min, and humidity
of 60%. NaCl particles with an average particle size of 0.6 μm
were used as the test particles following Korea Filter 80 (KF80) standard.

Photocatalytic Decomposition Test
The sample was irradiated
with ultraviolet light (UV) using an accelerated
weathering tester (QUV, Q-Lab) to evaluate the photocatalytic decomposition
behavior. The wavelength of the UV irradiation was 340 nm, and the
intensity of UV irradiation was 0.68 W/m2. The temperature
of the chamber was 60 °C, and the humidity was 50%. To confirm
the photocatalytic decomposition behavior at different UV irradiation
times, the samples were exposed to UV irradiation for 3, 6, and 9
days. The weight losses of PVA nanofilters after heat treatment, and
the PVA/TiO2 nanofilters after the photocatalytic decomposition
were calculated using eq 10. 10  where W0 is the weight
of the filter before heat treatment or photocatalytic decomposition,
and W1 is the weight of the filter after
heat treatment or photocatalytic decomposition.

Conclusions
In this study, photocatalytically
degradable PVA/TiO2 nanofilters were fabricated by electrospinning
to overcome the limitations regarding the disposal of existing filters
by incineration or in landfills, which might cause environmental pollution.
The optimum concentration of the PVA solution was confirmed by FE-SEM
images of the electrospun PVA nanofibers. Changes in the crystallinity,
filtration efficiency, and the pressure drop of PVA nanofilters were
observed before and after heat treatment. In addition, when TiO2 particles were added, the fiber diameter decreased by lowering
the viscosity of the PVA solution and the filtration efficiency was
effectively improved compared to that of the PVA-only nanofilter.
Moreover, we also confirmed the photocatalytic decomposition of PVA/TiO2 nanofilters by investigating the disappearance of the C=O
peaks under UV irradiation. We finally concluded that PVA/TiO2 nanofilters fabricated in this study can be used as eco-friendly
filters.
