Organic ligand complexes of lanthanide/actinide
ions have been
studied extensively for applications in nuclear fuel storage and recycling.
Several complexes of 2,6-bis(2-benzimidazyl)pyridine (H2BBP) featuring
the uranyl moiety have been reported recently, and the present study
investigates the coordination characteristics of these complexes using
density functional theory-based electronic structure analysis. In
particular, with the aid of several computational models, the nonplanar
equatorial coordination about uranyl, observed in some of the compounds,
is studied and its origin traced to steric effects.

Introduction
It
is essential to understand the behavior of actinide complexes
for the development of separation technologies and future nuclear
fuel recycling processes.1 Organic ligands,
which coordinate to lanthanides/actinides, have been studied extensively2 and will be a key element in the management and
long-term storage of nuclear waste. In this context, the tridentate
N-donor ligand 2,6-bis(2-benzimidazyl)pyridine (H2BBP),
shown schematically in Figure 1, has been studied in the past as a low-valent actinide sequestering
agent and as a sensitizer for lanthanide luminescence.3−9 We have previously reported the experimental synthesis and spectroscopic
characterization of a series of uranyl ({UO2}2+) complexes featuring the BBP ligand and its derivatives.10,11 Interestingly, crystallographic characterization of the complexes
revealed nonplanarity in the equatorial ligand coordination structure
about the uranyl moiety and a modulation of the nonplanarity with
changing ligand character, all without significant structural changes
in the uranyl moiety. Structural distortions of uranyl complexes have
been examined extensively, and much of the focus has been upon the
uranyl moiety itself.12−15 Altering both the steric and electronic characteristics of the equatorial
ligands has been shown to play a role in changing the U=O bond
lengths of the ({UO2}2+) structural unit as
well as opening up new avenues for reactivity.16,17 There has also been interest in distorting the dioxo O–U–O
bond angle from its typical linear arrangement.18−22 Recently, Hayton and co-workers reported a series
of uranyl complexes with macrocyclic ligands, whose steric constraints
push the O–U–O bond angle slightly away from its desired
linear arrangement.22 Distortion of the
equatorial ligands has also been seen previously in other uranyl complexes.22−24 For example, Berthet and co-workers reported a variety of uranyl
complexes featuring different N-donor ligands, including [(UO2)(terpy)(OTf)2] (terpy = 2,6-bis(2-pyridyl)pyridine)
and [U(phen)3][OTf]2 (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline),
which both exhibit a significant deviation from planarity.24

The aim of this study is to investigate
in detail the coordination
characteristics of BBP–uranyl complexes through first-principles
theoretical simulations and to determine the origin of the nonplanarity
of the equatorial ligands, either steric or electronic. To this end,
a series of computational experiments are carried out, which clarify
the relationship between ligand character and nonplanarity.

The three complexes, [(UO2)(H2BBP)Cl2] (1), [(UO)2(HBBP)(Py)Cl] (2), and [(UO2) (BBP)(Py)2] (3),
that were experimentally synthesized and form the primary subjects
of this investigation are shown in Figure 2. The complexes have similar BBP ligands,
which provide three coordinating bonds, but differ in the character
of the two additional ligands that complete the pentagonal equatorial
coordination structure around the uranyl moiety. Compound 1 has two Cl– groups, compound 2 has
one Cl– and one pyridine, whereas compound 3 has two pyridines as the additional ligands. There are also
concomitant differences in the charge state of the BBP ligand. As
shown in Figure 2,
N4 and N5 on the BBP ligand are protonated in compound 1 and are both deprotonated in 3. In 2,
N5, which is on the side of the pyridine attachment, is protonated,
whereas N4 is not. In terms of coordination, 1 and 2 exhibit distinct noncoplanarity with the equatorial plane
compared to 3, which is coplanar about the equatorial
plane and symmetric under reflection. One of the main objectives of
the current study is to determine whether electronic or steric effects
drive the observed coordination structure differences in these complexes.
A density functional theory (DFT)-based analysis of the crystal structures
of the three molecular complexes, 1–3, has been reported previously.10 However,
as will be shown later, crystal packing has very little effect on
the interesting structural differences related to nonplanarity about
the uranyl. Additionally, some of the complexes we simulate to investigate
trends in bonding and nonplanarity have not been synthesized experimentally,
and because the molecular crystals of these systems often depend on
incorporated solvent units, trying to predict their crystalline structures
from first-principles simulations would distract from the
main focus of this work. Therefore, in this study, we investigate
the intrinsic structural characteristics of the isolated molecular
units of BBP–uranyl complexes free from crystal packing effects.

Results and Discussion
Relevant bond lengths and bond angles
extracted from optimized
geometries of the isolated complexes are compared to experimental
molecular crystal values, as summarized in Table 1. We have shown previously10 that generalized gradient approximation (GGA)-optimized
structural parameters of molecular crystals agree reasonably well
with the experiment with errors within the 3% range. In the case of
isolated complexes, we find slightly larger differences, with bond
lengths typically longer by 3–5% compared to those of experimental
crystal structures, and we attribute this to the absence of the crystalline
environment in the calculations. However, the utility of the isolated
molecular calculations is that they enable us to identify trends in
the structural properties that are intrinsic to the complexes rather
than driven by crystal packing. For instance, the experimentally observed
trend that the BBP N–U bond lengths get progressively shorter
going from 1 to 3 is reproduced for the
isolated complexes. Accordingly, as can be inferred from Table 1, the average calculated
BBP N–U bond length decreases from 2.722 to 2.505 Å going
from 1 to 3. Meanwhile, the crystalline
O=U=O bond angles deviate from 180° by an increasing
degree going from 1 to 3, but this trend
is not observed in the simulated structures of the isolated complexes.
This is because the O=U=O bond angle is significantly
affected by crystal packing and DFT simulations reproduce the observed
trend in crystals.10 Meanwhile, the U=O
bond lengths do not change significantly across the three complexes
in both the experimental and theoretical structures.

a Equatorial
planes are generated
by sets of three points, namely, Cl1–U–Cl2 in compound 1, Cl1–U–N6 in compound 2, and
N6–U–N7 in compound 3 (see Figure 2). Units for distances and
angles are angstroms and degrees, respectively.

To better understand the origin
of the observed nonplanarity in 1 and 2,
we investigated several potential driving
factors, such as crystal packing, ligand character, and steric hindrance.
The degree of nonplanarity about the uranyl is quantified by first
defining an equatorial plane in each complex built by sets of three
points: (U1, Cl1, Cl2) in 1, (U1, Cl1, N6) in 2, and (U1, N6, N7) in 3. The angle between the equatorial
plane and a plane formed by the BBP N sites (N1, N2, N3) shows how
much the uranyl is elevated with respect to the plane of the BBP,
yielding the degree of nonplanarity. As shown in Table 1, compound 1 shows
the highest angle, whereas compound 3 is virtually flat
and symmetric, in both the experiments and computations. Complex 2 shows an intermediate nonplanar angle between compounds 1 and 3.

The realization of a nonplanar
configuration in isolated units
of complexes 1 and 2 suggests that it is
an intrinsic feature of the complexes themselves and not a result
of crystal packing effects. However, given the structural complexity
of these compounds, we still need to verify the energetic stability
of the nonplanar structures with respect to planar motifs. To this
end, we consider a model unit of complex 1 in a supercell
geometry, with the structure of the model initially configured so
that all of the equatorial ligands form a plane as shown in Figure 3. We then carry out
a constrained structural optimization whereby all of the atoms of
the BBP ligand are constrained to lie in the Cl1–U–Cl2
plane during the optimization. Once all of the forces in this planar
structure fall below 0.01 eV/Å, we release the previously imposed
constraint and allow all of the atomic positions to further relax
until all of the forces are smaller than 0.001 eV/Å. Thus, we
find that a planar configuration with almost no forces acting on the
atoms can be realized in the calculation even though its energy is
0.124 eV higher than that of the optimized nonplanar configuration,
suggesting that the planar configuration is at best a local minimum.
A vibrational analysis of the planar structure confirms the instability
through an imaginary low-frequency (26.4 cm–1) vibrational
mode with an out-of-plane displacement of the entire {UO2}2+ unit relative to the BBP ligand. This establishes
that the nonplanar geometry is indeed the intrinsically stable minimum-energy
configuration of 1 and not a result of crystal packing.
Interestingly, the geometric parameters of the optimized planar and
nonplanar configurations of the isolated complex, 1,
provide some insight into the role of sterics (see Table 2). We find that in the out-of-plane
configuration, BBP N-uranyl bond lengths are shorter
on average by ∼0.034 Å, the U–N1 and U–N2
bonds being significantly shorter, and ∠N1–N2–N3
of the BBP ligand at 115.3° is also smaller by 2.9° compared
to that in the in-plane configuration. In contrast, ∠Cl1–U–Cl2
is smaller by 5.6° and the Cl1–H1 and Cl2–H2 distances
are 9.5% shorter in the planar geometry. Thus, accommodating {UO2}2+ in the plane of the BBP ligand requires a more
open ∠N1–N2–N3, longer BBP N-uranyl bonds, and a narrower ∠Cl1–U–Cl2, all
of which suggest steric interaction in the equatorial plane between
the Cl– ions and the nearby H groups on the benzimidazole
rings of BBP. Conversely, being out-of-plane and thereby increasing
the Cl1–H1 and Cl2–H2 distances not only allows the
uranyl to strengthen its bonding to the BBP ligand but also allows
the latter to achieve an unstrained ∠N1–N2–N3
that is similar to that found in complexes 2 and 3. These findings point to the steric interaction between
the Cl– ions and the H sites on the outer benzimidazole
groups as potentially driving the nonplanarity.

To further investigate this, we consider the effect
of substituting
the Cl– ligands in complex 1 with other
halide ligands characterized by different ionic radii and electronegativities.
We note that in contrast to when the Cl– ligands
are replaced by pyridine ligands the substitution of Cl– by other halides leaves the formal charge on the BBP ligand unchanged,
enabling us to vary the properties of one set of ligands, that is,
the halides whereas leaving the properties of the BBP ligand nominally
unchanged. In Table 3, we present GGA-optimized geometric parameters for a series of molecules
derived from complex 1 by substituting Cl– with F– through I– (see Figure 4). We find that the
out-of-plane angle increases monotonically with increasing ionic radius
(rion) of the halide ligands (indicated
by labels α1 and α2), going from an almost planar structure
for F– to a nonplanar angle of 39.9° in the
case of I–. Additionally, ∠α1–U−α2
is also seen to decrease monotonically from F– to
I– with an overall change of 5%. In particular,
as shown in Table 3, (rion + 0.9 Å) is seen to be a
good approximation to the distance between each halide ion and the
nearest H site on the BBP benzimidazole groups across all of the halide
ligand complexes. This suggests that in these complexes the α1–uranyl−α2
moiety moves out of the BBP plane and simultaneously ∠α1–U−α2
reduces until the halide to benzimidazole H distance reaches approximately
(rion + 0.9 Å). An effective radius
of 0.9 Å is therefore indicated for H groups in their interaction
with halide ions. Meanwhile, the U–N1 and U–N3 bond
lengths show neither significant variation nor a systematic trend
across the halide-substituted series, whereas the U–N2 bond
length actually decreases slightly going from F– to I–. This is in contrast to complexes 2 and 3 where the reduced nonplanar angle is
also accompanied by reduced U–N1, U–N2, and U–N3
distances relative to 1. Thus, we can infer that once
the halide–benzimidazole H steric interaction is accommodated
through nonplanarity, the BBP N-uranyl bond lengths
are modulated primarily by the effective charge state of the BBP ligand.
A similar computational experiment as described before in the case
of complex 1, with structures generated by initially
enforcing perfect planarity of all atoms in the BBP ligand and the
α1–U−α2 group, indicates that the optimized
planar structures are higher in energy than the corresponding fully
unconstrained equilibrium structures by 0.025, 0.124, 0.197, and 0.316
eV in the F–-, Cl–-, Br–-, and I–-substituted complexes, respectively.
A vibrational frequency analysis further indicates that such structures
are unstable with respect to a motion of the α1–U−α2
moiety out of the plane of the BBP ligand. Soft imaginary frequency
modes corresponding to this out-of-plane motion are obtained at 18,
26, 29, and 36 cm–1 for the F–-, Cl–-, Br–-, and I–-substituted complexes, respectively. We note in this instance that
both the energy difference between the perfectly planar and unconstrained
structures and the magnitude of the unstable mode energies increase
monotonically with the halide ligand size. Interestingly, for F–, although a weakly unstable mode for out-of-plane
motion of F––U–F– is detected in the perfectly planar structure, in practice, the
F– complex assumes its lower energy equilibrium
geometry through a slight buckling of the BBP ligand itself rather
than such an out-of-plane motion.

respectively. The numbers in parentheses indicate (rion + 0.9 Å).

Having established that for a given N-donor ligand, that is, BBP,
reducing the ionic radius of the equatorial halide ligands leads to
a reduced out-of-plane angle, we next investigated if for a given
halide ligand, reducing the effective size of the N-donor ligand leads
to a similar trend. We reason that if steric hindrance is the primary
driver of nonplanarity then the effect should be similar whether it
is the size of the halide ligands or the N-donor ligand that is reduced.
Accordingly, we truncated the outer benzene rings of the benzimidazole
groups on the BBP ligand to obtain a smaller pi-conjugated ligand
(see Figure 1) such
that for a given nonplanar angle, the H atoms on the imidazole rings
of this ligand are farther away from the halide ions. This truncated
BBP (tr-BBP) ligand has the same nominal charge state as that of the
unmodified BBP ligand. We constructed four modified complexes featuring
the tr-BBP and F–, Cl–, Br–, and I– ligands as shown in Figure 5 and optimized their
geometries. We find that for each type of halide ion the degree of
nonplanarity with the tr-BBP ligand is significantly smaller than
that with the original BBP ligand as is evident from the nonplanar
angles reported in Table 4. Furthermore, we see that in the case of the larger halide
ions where perfect planarity is not attained, the final distance between
the halide ion and the nearest H atom on tr-BBP is similar to the
corresponding value observed in the case of the unmodified BBP ligand
(see Table 3). For
Cl–, Br–, and I–, (rion + 0.9 Å) is once again a
good predictor of the optimized halide to H group distance, whereas
for the smaller F– ion where planarity is reached,
this distance is larger than (rion + 0.9
Å). Finally, as before, we find a monotonic decrease of ∠α1–U−α2
and the U–N2 bond length with increasing rion, whereas the U–N1 and U–N3 bond lengths
show a weak but opposite trend. ∠N1–N2–N3 also
show a weak monotonically increasing trend across the series but with
values that are comparable to those obtained with the full BBP ligand.
Weaker trends are also apparent in perfectly planar analogues of the
tr-BBP complexes where, as before, planarity of all atoms in the tr-BBP
ligand and the α1–U−α2 moiety is initially
enforced. We find that the optimized planar structures are higher
in energy relative to the equilibrium structures by 0.058, 0.085,
0.061, and 0.064 eV, respectively, for the F–, Cl–, Br–, and I– ligand
complexes. Interestingly, a vibrational analysis of the planar structures
does not yield unstable modes corresponding to a clear out-of-plane
motion of the α1–U−α2 moiety except in the
case of the F– complex. This suggests that the planar
Cl–-, Br–-, and I–-substituted tr-BBP–uranyl complexes represent higher energy
local minima, whereas the planar F– complex, with
more compact U–N1 and U–N3 bonds and a smaller ∠N1–N2–N3,
is weakly unstable. Despite subtle variations in the behavior of the
planar structures, given that the same choice of the halide ligand
yields equilibrium structures with very different nonplanar angles
based on the size of the N-donor ligand, we are once again able to
establish the primacy of steric effects and rule out halogen electronegativity
differences, as being a significant factor in the structural trends
observed across the series of halide ligand complexes. Our computational
study shows that the structural properties of N-donor uranyl complexes
are sensitive to both the effective charge states of the ligands and
steric interactions and can be systematically tuned by incorporating
ligands of different sizes.

Conclusions
The structural properties of a series of uranyl complexes; [(UO2)(H2BBP)Cl2] (1), [(UO)2(HBBP)(Py)Cl] (2), and [(UO2)(BBP)(Py)2] (3); based on the N-donor ligand 2,6-bis(2-benzimidazyl)pyridine
(H2BBP) are investigated theoretically with a particular
emphasis on the nonplanarity observed in these complexes about the
equatorial plane of uranyl. Through a series of computational experiments,
the role of different factors such as crystal packing, ligand electronegativity,
and steric effects in driving the nonplanarity is explored. We find
that the steric interaction between bulky halide ligands characterized
by large ionic radii and nearby H groups on the benzimidazole groups
of the BBP ligand is the primary reason for the nonplanarity and the
role of other factors, such as axial uranyl distortions, is insignificant
in this regard. Furthermore, these steric effects can be exploited
to systematically tune the structural properties of these complexes
by incorporating ligands of different sizes, and we believe this will
be useful for the design of actinide complexes.

Computational Details
Electronic structure calculations were carried out using the DFT25,26 platform provided by the Vienna ab initio simulation package,27,28 which implements a planewave basis set framework in conjunction
with projector augmented wave29 pseudopotentials.
The DFT exchange-correlation energy is modeled within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof30 GGA.31 A planewave
cutoff of 400 eV is used for the wave functions, and the Brillouin
zone is sampled at the Γ point. As the uranium ion in {UO2}2+ features a nominally empty 5f shell in its U6+ oxidation state with an electronic configuration
of 1s22s22p63s23p3d104s24p64d104f145s25p65d106s26p6, f-electrons do not play a significant role
in the ground state electronic structure. Therefore, on-site Coulomb
repulsion corrections are not employed in our structural analysis.
Relativistic effects are taken into account within the core regions
of the atoms in constructing the pseudopotentials employed but are
neglected in the valence self-consistent field calculations. Supercells
of the isolated complexes are constructed within a periodic boundary
condition approach so that atoms in neighboring image cells are separated
by at least 8 Å of vacuum, and the Brillouin zone is sampled
at the zone center. Geometry optimizations are carried out until all
forces are smaller than 0.01 eV/Å. Structural models shown were
created using the VESTA-332 program.
