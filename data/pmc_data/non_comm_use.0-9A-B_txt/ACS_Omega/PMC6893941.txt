To date, the preparation
of a novel ultrafiltration membrane and
the efficient separation and purification of protein solutions have
gradually attracted widespread attention of many researchers. In this
study, a hollow porous polystyrene/ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymer
blend nanofibrous membrane (PS/EVA-BNM) was generated by electrospinning
and chemical modification and then used to separate and purify proteins
in solution. The BNM was characterized by scanning electron microscopy
and specific surface area and pore size analyses. The membrane separation
system was assembled using the BNM, which was overlaid to form the
reaction layer. The optimal conditions for protein separation were
determined by adjusting the operating pressure, filtration time, and
pH. The results showed that the rejection rate of serum albumin and
the membrane flux could reach 94.35% and 2.04 L/(m2 min),
respectively, under the following conditions: the operating pressure
was 0.10 MPa and the processing time was 1.5 h. By comparing the parameters
of the polyethersulfone commercial ultrafiltration membrane with the
PS/EVA-BNM system, it could be inferred that the rejection rate of
the latter decreased slightly, whereas its transport flux improved
several times. At the same time, the experimental results indicated
that the PS/EVA-BNM possessed excellent reusability and mechanical
properties. Additionally, the BNM could retain its nanofibrous morphological
structure after the separation of serum albumin several times in an
aqueous environment.

1 Introduction
Proteins, an important
constituent in organisms, usually exist
in relatively complex systems. In the process of production, proteins
are sensitive to changes in the pH and temperature of the external
environment, which can easily affect the structure of proteins and
cause denaturation.1,2 Currently, precipitation, ion
exchange, electrophoresis, centrifugation, and chromatographic methods
are commonly used to separate and purify proteins in solution. However,
these methods also have many disadvantages, such as high production
cost, complexity, and low separation and purification efficiency,
which are not conducive to their popularization and application.3,4 In recent years, membrane separation technology has attracted increasing
attention because of its many distinctive features, such as simplicity,
mild treatment conditions, and requiring no reagents.5−7 In the process of membrane separation, proteins in complex systems
can be separated and purified quickly and efficiently by choosing
an appropriate separation membrane and adjusting operation pressure,
filtration time, and other process parameters. Membrane separation
technology mainly utilizes the impetus on both sides of the membrane
to separate and purify the solution mixture through selective membranes.
At present, nanofibrous membranes prepared by electrospinning are
one of the hotspots in membrane separation.8 The nanofiber membranes effectively improve the separation and purification
efficiency and reduce energy consumption in the process of protein
separation and purification because of their small fiber diameter,
large specific surface area, and high porosity.9

Ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) is
a commonly used
plastic material that is prepared by high-pressure bulk polymerization
or solution polymerization of EVA. In contrast to polyethylene, vinyl
acetate monomer was introduced into the EVA molecular chain, which
reduced the crystallinity and improved the flexibility, impact resistance,
filler compatibility, and thermal sealing performance.10,11 It is well known that the properties of EVA resins mainly depend
on the content of vinyl acetate (VA) in the molecular chain. Currently,
EVA resin is widely used in various industrial fields, and the demand
for EVA as a matrix resin in hot melt adhesives exceeds 80%. The reason
is that EVA has excellent softness and heating fluidity and low temperature
resistance. Compared with thermosetting, solvent-based and water-based
adhesives, EVA materials generally have the characteristics of no
solvent, no pollution, low-energy consumption, and convenient operation.12 The EVA hot melt adhesive is solid, and it can
be processed into thin films, rods, strips, or particles according
to different requirements under ambient temperature. However, the
preparation of EVA nanofibers by electrospinning and their application
in protein separation and purification have not been reported. In
this study, EVA nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning for the
first time and used as nanofiber mesh adhesive materials. At the same
time, because nanofiber adhesives have the characteristics of small
diameter, large specific surface area, and uniform distribution of
bonding area,13 the melted EVA nanofibers
can effectively and uniformly bond materials under certain pressure
and temperature conditions, thus significantly improving the uniformity
and strength of materials.

First, polystyrene/polyvinylpyrrolidone/EVA
copolymer (PS/PVP/EVA)
hybrid nanofiber membranes were prepared by electrospinning. The PVP
components in the nanofiber membranes were removed by hydrolysis modification.
The blend nanofibrous membrane (BNM) was heated by hot pressing under
specific temperature and pressure conditions. Finally, the PS/EVA-BNM
with a uniform and dense fiber surface and porosity was successfully
prepared. Subsequently, these membranes and commercial polyethersulfone
(PES) ultrafiltration membranes were used as separation layers to
construct membrane separation systems for the same concentration of
serum albumin solution (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Preparation of PS/EVA porous nanofiber membranes and schematic
diagram of the protein separation process.

Furthermore, the BNM obtained by electrospinning and physical modification
has high porosity and is uniform and dense, which can effectively
improve the membrane flux and antifouling ability in the process of
protein separation and purification. In this paper, the separation
performance of the PS/EVA-BNM in bovine serum albumin solution was
systematically analyzed, which provided an experimental basis for
the application of nanofiber membranes in protein solution post-treatment.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Surface Morphology of PS/EVA-BNM
The PS/EVA-BNM was prepared by electrospinning and physical modification.
It was used to isolate and purify serum albumin in solution. The PS/PVP/EVA-BNM,
PS/EVA-BNM, and PES ultrafiltration membrane and the membranes after
the isolation and purification of serum albumin were examined by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and the results are shown in Figure 2. It can be clearly seen in Figure 2A that the PS/PVP/EVA-BNM
with a uniform diameter and good morphology was prepared by electrospinning
technology. The diameters of the nanofibers are between 300 and 450
nm. Figure 2B shows
that the dense and porous PS/EVA-BNM was formed by means of a chemical
modification and hot-pressing process accompanied by dissolution of
the PVP component and fusion bonding of the EVA component in the BNM.
Moreover, the morphology of the blend nanofibers was distorted and
deformed, as seen from the SEM images. Although the diameter of the
blend nanofibers increased to a certain extent (400–600 nm),
the diameter of the nanofibers became more uneven. In addition, it
can be found that the morphology of the blend nanofibers remained
stable during the process of separating and purifying the serum albumin
solution, and a large number of pores between and within the fibers
were covered with numerous protein molecules, as seen in Figure 2C. As shown in Figure 2D,E, the surface
of the commercial PES ultrafiltration membrane showed uniform nanopores
before protein separation. After separation of the protein solution,
a large number of protein molecules entered the void of the fiber
membrane and evenly covered the surface of the PES ultrafiltration
membrane, resulting in the disappearance of nanopores in the ultrafiltration
membrane.

of PS/PVP/EVA and PS/EVA nanofiber membranes before and after protein
separation, respectively. (D,E) represent the morphology of the commercial
PES ultrafiltration membrane before and after protein separation,
respectively).

2.2 Specific
Surface Area and Average Pore Size
It is well known that
the specific surface area and porosity values
of the separation membrane are some of the most important factors
in the protein separation process.14,15 In this paper,
the test results of the specific surface area and average pore size
of PS/PVP/EVA and PS/EVA nanofibrous membranes are shown in Table 1. Table 1 clearly shows that the specific
surface areas of the electrospun PS/PVP/EVA and PS/EVA-BNM are 23.85
and 162.37 m2/g, respectively. The main reason for this
phenomenon is that the PVP component in the PS/PVP composite nanofiber
membrane was dissolved and removed during the hydrolysis process.
Therefore, a large number of nanoholes with different pore sizes are
produced within and on the surface of the PS/PVP composite nanofibers.16 Although the voids of some composite nanofiber
membranes are covered during hot pressing and melting bonding of EVA
fibers, the specific surface area of the porous PS/EVA-BNM is still
significantly higher than that of the electrospun PS/PVP/EVA nanofibers.
In addition, the average pore diameter of the BNM was reduced from
28.46 to 21.5 nm after hydrolysis and hot-pressing modification. This
is because the surface of the nanofibers produced many small-diameter
nanoholes during hydrolysis modification, and hot-pressing treatment
further compressed the pores between nanofibers, resulting in a reduction
in the average pore size of the nanofiber membrane. The PS/EVA nanofiber
membrane after hydrolysis modification and hot-pressing treatment
could efficiently separate a large number of purified serum albumin
macromolecules because of its large specific surface area and small
average pore diameter.

Specific Surface
Area, and Pore Size of PS/PVP/EVA and PS/EVA Nanofibrous Membranes
 	PS/PVP/EVA-BNM	PS/EVA-BNM

average pore size (nm)	28.46	21.5	
tensile stress
(MPa)	1.98	4.62	
elongation at break (%)	24.93	20.72	
2.3 Mechanical Property
Porous nanofiber
membranes generally have poor mechanical properties, mainly because
of the uneven distribution of macromolecules and crystalline regions
in the fibers, and the fibers are easily broken in many pore regions.17,18 The mechanical properties of electrospun PS/PVP/EVA-BNM and hot-pressed
PS/EVA-BNM at a temperature of 80 °C are shown in Table 1. (Each sample in this experiment
was tested three times under the same conditions, and their average
values were calculated.) From Table 1, it can be found that the tensile breaking strength
and elongation at break of hot-pressed PS/EVA-BNM reached 4.62 MPa
and 20.72%, respectively. However, the maximum breaking strength and
elongation at break of untreated electrospun PS/PVP/EVA-BNM were only
1.98 MPa and 24.93%, respectively, under the same conditions. The
reason for this situation is that the EVA nanofibers in the BNM were
melt-deformed under high-temperature conditions to bond many adjacent
fibers, and multiple uniform and stable bonding points were formed
inside and on the surface of the BNM.19,20 Therefore,
the overall mechanical properties of the composite fiber membrane
were enhanced to some extent due to the mesh-like adhesive structure
and the topological entanglements among the nanofibers.

2.4 Membrane Separation Performance
In
this experiment, a porous PS/EVA-BNM was prepared by electrospinning
and physical modification to achieve the separation and purification
of serum albumin solution. The membrane separation performance was
characterized by the protein rejection and permeation flux of solution.
During the membrane separation process, the operating pressure, treatment
time, membrane pore size, and distribution, the solution flow rate
and other factors greatly affected the membrane separation performance.21,22 This paper mainly studies the relationship between the operating
pressure, number of membrane layers, separation time, protein rejection
rate, and solution permeation flux in the process of membrane separation.
Furthermore, the Coomassie brilliant blue method was used to determine
the protein content in the solution.

2.4.1 Effect
of Membrane Number on Protein Separation
Performance
In the experiment, the effect of different layers
of the nanofiber membrane on the separation performance of the protein
solution was studied, as shown in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3, the protein retention rate first increased
rapidly with a gradual increase in the number of membrane layers and
then reached equilibrium with approximately four membrane layers.
At this time, the equilibrium value of the protein retention rate
reached 94.35%. In contrast, as the number of layers in the separation
membrane increased, the value of the membrane flux gradually decreased.
When the number of membrane layers was less than 4, the separation
membrane maintained a high membrane flux, and the number of membrane
layers continued to increase, resulting in a rapid decrease in the
membrane flux. The reason is that with the gradual increase in the
number of membrane layers, the filtration resistance produced by the
separation membrane increased slowly in the process of protein separation.23,24 According to the comprehensive analysis, when the number of nanofiber
membrane layers in the separation device was 4, the separation and
purification process still had excellent solution permeation flux
while maintaining a high rejection rate. Therefore, the four-layer
laminated PS/EVA-BNM was selected as a separation layer to construct
a membrane separation system, and the serum albumin solution was separated
and purified in this study.

Figure 3 Effect of membrane layer numbers on protein
separation performance.

2.4.2 Effect
of Membrane Separation Time on Protein
Separation and Purification
In this study, when the operating
pressure was constant at 0.1 MPa, the relationship among the separation
time of serum albumin, membrane permeation flux, and protein rejection
rate was analyzed, as shown in Figure 4. The membrane flux of the PS/EVA nanofiber membrane
and PES ultrafiltration membrane decreased with the extension of the
filtration time. The relationship between protein retention and separation
time was also analyzed. The retention rate of PS/EVA-BNM in a serum
albumin solution gradually increased with the increasing separation
time. When the filtration time reached 1.5 h, the protein retention
rate reached 93.59%, which is basically the same as that of the commercial
PES ultrafiltration membrane. When the filtration time was further
prolonged, the protein retention rate remained basically in equilibrium.
However, the results of the membrane flux measurements were the opposite.
As the separation time increased, the solution permeability of two
different nanofiber membranes decreased. When the filtration time
was 4 h, the solution permeabilities of the two separation membranes
slowly reached a stable value. In addition, it can be seen that the
self-made blend nanofiber membrane has a large solution permeation
flux during the 24 h filtration process while maintaining a high protein
retention rate from the figure. Such experimental results exhibited
that the self-made nanofiber membrane has a good application prospect
in practical applications.

Figure 4 Effect of filtration time on membrane separation
performance.

The main reason for this phenomenon
was that the average pore size
of commercial PES ultrafiltration membrane (3.2 nm) is significantly
smaller than that of self-made PS/EVA nanofiber membrane (21.5 nm).
It was well known that the separation membrane presented that the
smaller the pore size, the stronger the solute retention ability and
weaker solution permeability it always exhibited. In addition, as
the filtration time was prolonged, on the one hand, many protein molecules
accumulated on the surface or inside of nanofibers, which further
reduced the pore size of the nanofibers and improved the protein retention
rate. On the other hand, the protein concentration inside and on the
surface of the separation membrane was significantly higher than that
of the top unfiltered solution, thus causing the flow resistance of
the membrane to increase as the separation time increased. Furthermore,
the adsorption resistance, deposition resistance, and concentration
polarization on the surface of the fiber membranes also decreased
the membrane flux.25,26 Surprisingly, the permeation
flux of the PS/EVA nanofiber membrane was approximately 4–5
times that of the PES ultrafiltration membrane (50 kD); in other words,
the separation rate of serum albumin by the PS/EVA nanofiber membrane
was faster than that of the PES commercial membrane under the same
operating pressure.

2.4.3 Effect of Operating Pressure
on Protein
Separation and Purification
In this article, the membrane
flux and rejection rate of PS/EVA-BNM and a PES ultrafiltration membrane
(50 kD) were calculated after 90 min of filtration at 0.04–0.16
MPa pressure, as shown in Figure 5. The performances of separating and purifying serum
albumin by the two fiber membranes show a certain deviation under
different operating pressure conditions, as shown in Figure 5. When the operating pressure
value was small, the membrane flux of the PS/EVA-BNM and PES ultrafiltration
membrane were relatively low at the initial stage of separation because
the power of the solution flow during the separation process was weak;
with an increase in the pressure, the flow dynamics of the serum albumin
solution were significantly stronger than the flow resistance generated
by the separation membrane. Therefore, the flux of both nanofiber
membranes increased. However, the permeation flux of the PS/EVA-BNM
increased faster than that of traditional commercial ultrafiltration
membranes. As shown in Figure 5, the permeation flux of PS/EVA-BNM was always higher than
that of the PES ultrafiltration membrane under the same separation
time and different operating pressures. The PS/EVA-BNM and PES ultrafiltration
membrane maintained a high protein rejection rate with increasing
operating pressure values at the same separation time, as seen by
observing the change in the protein retention rate. Although the protein
retention rate of nanofiber membranes fluctuated slightly, the overall
data remained relatively stable. When the separation time was constant
and the operating pressure was 0.1 MPa, the nanofiber membrane could
effectively separate the serum albumin solution. With increasing operating
pressure, slight damage to the nanofiber membrane resulted in the
loss of some proteins in the separation process, which led to a decrease
in the protein retention capacity of the membrane.27

Figure 5 Effect of operating pressure on membrane separation performance.

2.4.4 Reusability of BNM
In the actual
protein separation and purification process, the membrane separation
system not only exhibited significant protein retention performance
but also showed excellent separation treatment efficiency; thus, it
can be better applied to real life. Thus, electrospun PS/EVA-BNM can
be used to efficiently separate and purify serum albumin under an
operating pressure of 0.1 MPa and filtration time of 90 min.

Figure 6 displays
the reusability of different nanofiber membranes for the separation
and purification of serum albumin solutions. It can be observed that
the separation performance of the two membranes remained substantially
stable with the increase in reuse times under an operation pressure
of 0.1 MPa and a filtration time of 90 min. At the same time, after
five times of repeated separation, the protein retention rate of the
PS/EVA-BNM was slightly lower than that of the commercial PES ultrafiltration
membrane, but the membrane flux was approximately 4 to 5 times the
commercial PES ultrafiltration membrane flux. Therefore, the homemade
PS/EVA-BNM has good reusability. The excellent protein separation
performance compared to that of commercial membranes and other reported
data illustrates the great potential of nanofiber membranes in improving
the separation rate and energy consumption in the field of protein
purification.28

on membrane separation performance.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a PS/EVA-BNM
was obtained by electrospinning; subsequently,
a PS/EVA porous nanofiber membrane with a uniform diameter, high porosity,
and uniform fiber membrane was manufactured by hydrolysis and hot
pressing. The PS/EVA nanofibrous membranes not only can improve the
inherent strength of the membrane but also have good uniformity and
compactness after hot-pressing treatment. The membrane separation
system based on the porous PS/EVA nanofibrous membrane can be used
to efficiently separate serum albumin solution. The study shows that
the protein retention rate of porous PS/EVA-BNM can reach 94.35% and
that the membrane flux can reach 2.04 L/min. Compared with that of
the PES ultrafiltration membrane, the solution permeation flux of
PS/EVA-BNM can be greatly improved by maintaining a higher rejection
rate. Moreover, the nanofiber membrane can be reused many times. The
experimental results show that electrospun porous PS/EVA-BNM improves
the separation rate and energy consumption during protein purification
and has a significant application prospect in protein separation and
purification pretreatment.

4 Experiment
4.1 Experimental Materials
PS, PVP, and
EVA were obtained from China Pharmaceutical Group Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd. Coomassie Brilliant Blue (G-250), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), trichloromethane (CHCl3), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased
from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Serum albumin was purchased
from Shanghai Jinsui Biological Technology Co., Ltd.

4.2 Electrospinning Porous PS/EVA Nanofiber Membrane
Prior
to electrospinning, lithium chloride nanoparticles were dried
in a muffle furnace to remove the moisture contained therein. Then,
1.4 g of EVA resin particles, 0.04 g of lithium chloride nanoparticles,
13.02 g of CHCl3, and 5.58 g THF were accurately weighed
and placed in a conical bottle of proper size. The composite spinning
solution with 7% EVA mass fraction was prepared by stirring for 15
min at 40 °C in a constant-temperature magnetic stirrer. The
mass ratio of CHCl3 and THF was 7:3, and the mass fraction
of lithium chloride was 0.2%. Afterward, 3.36 g of PS particles and
1.44 g of PVP powder were accurately weighed and dissolved in 35.2
g of DMF solvent. A homogeneous spinning solution with a 12% mass
fraction was prepared by constant-temperature magnetic stirring at
40 °C. The mass ratio of PS to PVP was 7:3. The PS/PVP and EVA
spinning solutions were placed in different syringes, and the syringes
were connected to a high-voltage dc power supply. The PS/PVP/EVA blend
nanofibrous was received by a rotating drum (the drum was connected
to a ground wire). The spinning parameters were mainly as follows:
the spinning speeds of PS/PVP and EVA were 0.8 and 0.2 mL/h, the distance
between the roller and the injector was 20 cm, and the applied voltage
was 18.5 kV. Under the above conditions, after continuous spinning
for 20 h, the collected nanofiber membranes were dried in a 40 °C
vacuum drying chamber for 2 h.

Subsequently, the above mentioned
blend nanofiber membranes (0.1 g) were immersed in 200 mL of ethanol
solution to react at room temperature for 24 h. The PVP component
in the PS/PVP composite nanofibers were dissolved and removed to prepare
porous PS/EVA nanofiber membranes (0.078 g).

4.3 Hot-Pressing
Treatment of Nanofiber Membrane
The porous PS/EVA nanofibers
were hot-pressed in a YM300 hot press
for 4 h at a pressure of 4 MPa and a temperature of 80 °C. Thus,
the EVA fibers in the composite membranes could be partially melted
and uniformly and compactly bonded to multiple adjacent nanofibers,
and a PS/EVA-BNM with good mechanical properties and porous morphology
could be prepared.

According to the requirements of the mechanical
properties test, the PS/EVA dried nanofiber membranes before and after
hot pressing were first cut into 5 × 10 cm samples, and then,
the mechanical performance was investigated using a table-top tensile
tester (Instron 1185, USA). In this experiment, the sample drawing
speed was set to 10 mm/min, and each group of samples was tested 3
times, and the average value was obtained.

4.4 Characterization
Test of Nanofibers
An S-4800 scanning electron microscope
from Hitachi Company was used
to observe the morphology of various nanofiber membranes, and the
samples were sprayed with gold before testing. According to the requirements
of specific surface area and aperture analysis and measurement, the
homemade BNM and commercial PES ultrafiltration membrane test samples
were prepared, and the average pore diameter and BET specific surface
area of the nanofiber membrane were characterized by measurement of
the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms with a Conta
NOVA 2000E specific surface area and pore size analyzer.

4.5 Construction of Membrane Separation System
To analyze
the ability of the porous PS/EVA-BNMs to separate and
purify protein solutions, homemade BNMs (the thickness of each nanofiber
membrane was 0.22 mm) and commercially PES ultrafiltration membranes
were used as separation membranes. The membrane separation system
was constructed separately, and its structural schematic diagram is
shown in Figure 7.
A nylon diversion network was used as the support layer, and then,
the separation membrane was covered on the upper layer. Then, a serum
albumin solution was driven by a certain pressure, thus selectively
permeating the separation membrane to achieve the separation and purification
of proteins.

Figure 7 Electrospinning PS/EVA-BNM separation device (its “1”,
“2”, “3”, “4”, “5”,
and “6” are, respectively, serum albumin solution inlet,
nitrogen, PS/EVA-BNM, nylon drainage network, filtered solution outlet,
and serum albumin solution).

4.6 Separation Performances
A certain
quantity of serum albumin was accurately weighed and dissolved in
distilled water to prepare a 1 mg/mL serum albumin solution. Different
layers of uniform dense PS/EVA nanofiber membrane and a widely used
commercial PES ultrafiltration membrane (molecular weight of intercepted
protein was 50 kD) were used as filtration layers to construct a membrane
separation system for the separation and purification of serum albumin
solution, respectively. The retention rate of serum albumin and the
solution permeation flux of different membranes were measured to evaluate
their separation performances by regulating the pressure and filtration
time in the experiment. The protein rejection rate refers to the ratio
of the amount of serum albumin intercepted by the membrane to the
total amount of the solution, as shown in formula 1. 1  R indicates the rejection
rate of protein during membrane separation. C0 indicates the initial concentration of protein (mg/mL) in
the solution before membrane separation. CP indicates the concentration of protein in the filtrate after membrane
separation (mg/mL).

The main definition of membrane flux (solution
permeation flux) is the volume of solution penetrated by a separating
membrane per unit time and area, as calculated by eq 2. 2  J indicates the membrane
flux (L/(m2 min)). V indicates the volume
of filtrate (L). S indicates the effective area (m2) of the separation membrane. t indicates
the operation time of membrane separation (min).

To analyze
the separation and purification performance of nanofibrous
membranes with different numbers of layers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 layers
of PS/EVA-BNM were stacked together to form separation membranes.
The permeation flux and interception performance of separation membranes
were measured under the same operating conditions (the operation pressure
was 0.1 MPa, and the filtration time was 90 min). Parallel experiments
were carried out three times, and the standard deviation was calculated.
In this study, when the operating pressure was 0.1 MPa, the rotating
speed of the magnetic stirrer was set at 100 rad/min. The membrane
flux and protein rejection rate of the PS/EVA-BNMs and PES ultrafiltration
membranes were measured at different filtration times. A 1 mg/mL serum
albumin solution was used as the filtrate. In addition, the effect
of operating pressure on the membrane separation performance was studied
experimentally. The effects of operating pressure on membrane flux
and protein rejection rate were investigated when the filtration time
was 90 min and the operating pressure was between 0.04 and 0.16 MPa.
A serum albumin solution with a concentration of 1 mg/mL was separated
by PS/EVA-BNMs and commercial PES ultrafiltration membranes separately.
The nanofiber membrane was filtered and separated for 90 min under
an operating pressure of 0.1 MPa. The nanofiber membrane was washed
with distilled water 3–5 times, and the nanofibrous membrane
was backwashed with distilled water. The nanofiber membrane was reused
5 times under the operating conditions, and the membrane flux and
protein rejection rate were calculated during each separation process.
