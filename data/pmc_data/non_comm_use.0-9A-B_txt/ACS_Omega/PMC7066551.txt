Eradication of pharmaceutical drugs
from the global ecosystem has
received remarkable attention due to the extensive horrible consequences
on the human immunological system and the high rate of human deaths.
The urgent need for drug eradication became the dominant priority
for many research institutions worldwide due to the sharp increase
of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the human body, which inhibits
drug effectiveness and leads ultimately to death. Nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs
was fabricated from graphene oxide (GO) cross-linked via calcium ions
(Ca2+) with oxidized carbon nanotubes (O-CNTs) to eradicate
the well-known ciprofloxacin antibiotic drug from aqueous solutions.
The ciprofloxacin drug is medically prescribed in millions of medical
prescriptions every year and typically exists in domestic and wastewaters.
Characterization of the nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs was carried out through
spectroscopic (Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction
(XRD)), thermal (Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetry
(DTG)), and microscopic (scanning electron microscopy (SEM)) techniques.
Optimum parameters for the drug eradication process from aqueous solutions
were verified and selected as follows: contact time = 4 h, pH = 6.0,
temperature = 290 K, %CaCl2 = 0.5%, GO/O-CNT ratio = 4:1,
and adsorbent mass = 1.0 mg. The equilibrium data were fitted to different
adsorption isotherms, and the Langmuir isotherm provided the best
fit to our data. Dynamic studies demonstrated a pseudo-second-order
removal process for the ciprofloxacin drug, and thermodynamic parameters
confirmed exothermic drug adsorption (−27.07 kJ/mol) as well
as a physisorption process. For the sake of fighting against the generated
AMR, our working strategy demonstrated a removal efficiency of 99.2%
of the ciprofloxacin drug and drug uptake as high as 512 mg/g.

==== Body
Introduction
In recent years, the presence of pharmaceutical
medicines and drugs
in sewage, wastewaters, and domestic waters has been found to be responsible
for huge ecotoxicological effects on human health in different countries.1 The toxic side effects of pharmaceuticals in
water resources are extremely dangerous and have serious consequences
on human health, animals, and plants. Several studies have described
the harmful effects of pharmaceuticals on the aquatic environment
and their adverse ability to influence sexual functions and endocrine
activity of humans and animals.2,3 Nano- or microscale
concentrations of drugs were not previously considered harmful, but
it has become tremendously important to carefully monitor their concentrations
in aquatic environments.4,5 Growing drug concentrations,
especially antibiotic drugs, in sewage treatment effluents, wastewaters,
and drinking waters are mainly due to poorly metabolized drugs in
the human body secreted through human urine or dislodged feces routes.6 The increased annual consumption of pharmaceutical
drugs has led to an increase in their concentration in wastewaters,
which has reached 15 g per year per person, and it is expected to
increase in the future to 50–150 g.7 If the concentration of such drugs exceeds the shelf concentration,
they can become toxic to humans, animals, and plants. Therefore, drug
concentration in wastewaters must be measured to assess the ecotoxicity
on a daily basis.8 Latest statistics indicate
that there are more than 3700 approved pharmaceutical drugs in the
world.9 This huge number of drugs indicates
how difficult it is to treat their toxicity efficiently and how complicated
their removal techniques are in wastewaters.

Bacteria can frequently
generate resistance against antibiotic
drugs in the human body called antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The
generated resistance occurs through mutations in their genes or by
acquisition of foreign DNA coding through horizontal gene transfer,
and the bacteria can survive, and even grow, in the presence of antibiotic
drugs, leading to a condition under which the drugs become noneffective
on the patient, which aggravates with time and, at the end, may lead
to death.10−13 The most recent global statistics has declared 700,000 deaths in
2016 related to AMR and noneffective drugs,14 and the human mortality rate will reach 10 million per year by the
year 2050.15 Antibiotics in the aquatic
environment were considered responsible for human endocrine disruption.16 Moreover, pharmaceutical drugs caused a decrease
in the number of fish through increasing intersex and reducing fecundity17 and an increase in mortality rates of birds,
especially vultures.18 Such horrifying
information if not treated carefully can threaten the survival of
humans, animals, and plants on the globe. Therefore, innovative eradication
strategies must be developed to remove drugs entirely from wastewaters,
and new government regulations must be established and enforced to
eradicate pharmaceutical drugs from wastewaters. The ciprofloxacin
antibiotic is a widely used antibiotic that targets Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacteria.19 According
to the U.S. government data, there were more than 7 million medical
prescriptions for ciprofloxacin in 2019.20 Different countries have confirmed the presence of ciprofloxacin
in their municipal wastewaters and drinking water.21−25 The risk quotient (RQ) scale for ciprofloxacin was
identified as a high risk to the environment.23 Desbiolles found that ciprofloxacin is one of the most hazardous
pharmaceuticals in 75% of Mediterranean wastewater samples.8 Due to the chemical structure of ciprofloxacin,
it is considered a genotoxic compound, so it needs close monitoring
and treatment.22 Zhang conducted a study
on the relation between antibiotics and heavy metals, and the results
showed that the interaction of the antibiotic, ciprofloxacin, with
a group of heavy metals, copper, zinc, and cadmium, via coordination
sites gave rise to complexes that are more toxic than the interacting
compounds26 (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Ciprofloxacin drug.

Versatile techniques have been employed to remove pharmaceutical
drugs from wastewater, such as the conventional activated sludge process,27 anaerobic sludge digestion,28 biosorption,29 oxidation,30 reverse osmosis,31 removal using activated carbon,32 photobioreactors,
and16 nanotechnology.33 Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have two forms: single-walled and
multiwalled carbon nanotubes arranged in a hexagonal shape with outer
diameters of 4–30 nm, inner diameters of up to 0.4 μm,
length of around 1 μm, and a high adsorption surface area of
over 1000 m2/g.34 Carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) have high adsorption capacity due to their porous nature35,36 and are used to remove pharmaceutical products from wastewater.37,38 Graphene consists of a two-dimensional carbon layer that makes graphene
the thinnest material ever and has a specific surface area of about
2630 m2/g; many scientific disciplines are concerned with
the research on graphene, such as physics, materials science, chemistry,
and biology.39 Recently, oxidized graphene
(GO) nanocomposites have been used to eliminate pharmaceutical and
personal-care products.40−45 GO has a higher ability to adsorb polar materials than nonpolar
ones; the reason behind this is the strong interactions between polar
materials and polar functional groups on GO.46

In this work, we synthesized new nanohybrid materials composed
of graphene oxide (GO) and oxidized carbon nanotubes (O-CNTs) to fully
eliminate the ciprofloxacin drug from aqueous solutions. The ultimate
eradication strategy was established toward fighting against the induced
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) formed thereafter. The innovative nanohybrid
material was characterized by different techniques. Optimum conditions,
dynamics, and thermodynamics for the eradication of drugs were also
investigated.

Experimental Section
Materials
Carbon
nanotubes were purchased from Nanocyl
NC7000, graphene was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and the ciprofloxacin
drug (>99%) was gifted by a local pharmaceutical company. Other
reagents
were of analytical grade and were used as received. Tween 80, purchased
from BBC chemicals, was used as a dispersion surfactant, and its micellar
average molar mass was 79 000. Concentrated acids used in the
study were HCl (Scharlau), H2SO4 (Riedel-de
Haën), HNO3 (BBC Chemicals), and H3PO4 (Riedel-de Haën). H2O2 was obtained
from Merck.

Investigation Techniques
Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
A Bruker
FTIR spectrometer was used to investigate functional groups after
the oxidation process of graphene and multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(CNTs). Spectra were recorded in the range of 4000–400 cm–1 using KBr pellets. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
with a Netzsch Proteus thermogravimetric analyzer, was performed to
study the thermal stability of GO and multiwalled CNTs before and
after the oxidation processes. The samples were heated from ambient
temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under
a stream of inert N2 gas. The derivative thermogravimetry
(DTG) technique was used to determine the decomposition temperature
of the samples. Scanning electron microscopy [SEM; Inspect F50 scanning
electron microscope equipped with a high-resolution Schottky field
emission gun (FEG), high-vacuum Bruker energy-dispersive spectrometry
(EDS) microanalyzer, and XFlash silicon drift detector (SDD)] was
used to study the topological changes of graphene and multiwalled
CNTs before and after the oxidation processes. The samples were sputtered
by gold ions before being imaged. All images were tuned and resolved
by software programs of the instrument. UV–vis spectrophotometry
(Hach Lange DR5000 UV–vis spectrophotometer) was used to detect
ciprofloxacin concentrations at different time intervals. The samples
were scanned in the range of 200–800 nm and the maximum wavelength
(λmax) was selected as 275 nm. The
calibration curve for the ciprofloxacin drug was established, and
the drug concentration was monitored accordingly. For X-ray diffraction
(XRD) studies, a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV; 1 and 5 mm)
with Cu Kα radiation was used. An accelerating tube voltage
of 40 kV and a tube current of 40 mA were used to study the crystalline
structure of graphene and multiwalled CNTs before and after the oxidation
process. The scanning rate was 2°/min in the angle range from
5 to 60°.

Preparation of GO
Graphene (225
mg) was mixed with
30 mL of a mixture of sulfuric acid (H2SO4)
and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) (9:1 ratio) under
continuous stirring for 6 h according to Hummers’ method.47 Later on, 1.32 g of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) was added, and 675 μL of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was slowly dropped to remove unreacted KMNO4. Diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) was added, and the solution
was centrifuged and decanted. Eventually, the final product was washed
with a concentrated HCl:H2O solution (1:3 ratio) and dried.48

Preparation of O-CNTs
Briefly, 2.0
g of multiwalled
carbon nanotubes was placed in a dried 50 mL round-bottom flask equipped
with a condenser and 30 mL of 9.0 M HNO3 solution was slowly
added. The mixture was refluxed at 75 °C for 24 h, and after
completion, the oxidized CNTs were filtered and the suspended O-CNTs
particles were collected by centrifugation. The oxidized CNTs (O-CNTs)
were purified from nitric acid traces by continuous washing with distilled
water several times until the pH of the filtrate solution became neutral.
The O-CNT sample was dried at room temperature and stored until used.49

Synthesis of Nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs
Graphene oxide (GO,
0.5 g) was dispersed in 150 mL of 2.5% Tween 80 surfactant solution
(w/w) under continuous stirring at 70 °C for 2 h to make a water-dispersed
graphene oxide (GO) solution. Similarly, in a separate tube, 0.5 g
of oxidized carbon nanotubes (O-CNTs) was dispersed in 150 mL of 2.5%
Tween 80 surfactant solution at 70 °C to make a water-dispersed
CNT solution.50 The dispersed solutions
of GO and O-CNTs were slowly mixed and added dropwise into a CaCl2 solution to make 2% CaCl2 concentration under
stirring (100 rpm). For complete nucleation of the nanohybrid sample,
the mixture was left stirring overnight at ambient temperature. The
final nanohybrid product was collected by centrifugation, and the
nanohybrid GO/O-CNT materials were dried and stored until used elsewhere.

Ultimate Drug Eradication
The nanohybrid GO/O-CNT material
was placed in ciprofloxacin drug solutions of various concentrations
and shaken in a Memmert shaker for various periods of time. After
completion, the sample was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min, and
the supernatant was decanted. The ciprofloxacin drug uptake by the
nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs was calculated from the following relation 1  where qe is the
equilibrium drug uptake (in mg/g), C0 is
the initial concentration of the drug (in mg/L), Ce is the equilibrium drug concentration (in mg/L), V is the volume of the solution (in L), and w is the mass of the nanohybrid material (in g).

Batch adsorption
experiments were conducted to investigate and optimize the adsorption
conditions. For optimization of contact time, 1 mg of nanohybrid was
added into ciprofloxacin solutions having a concentration of 15 ppm
for time intervals from 0.5 to 48 h. The following parameters were
kept fixed during experiments: pH = 6.0, solution volume = 30 mL,
temperature = 17 °C, GO/O-CNT ratio = 1/1, and %CaCl2= 2.0%. For optimization of the mass of nanohybrid, different masses
in the range of 1–5 mg were used for the eradication process
at fixed pH = 6.0, solution volume = 30 mL, contact time = 4 h, temperature
= 17 °C, GO/O-CNT ratio = 1/1, and %CaCl2= 2.0%. For
optimization of temperature, batch adsorption experiments were carried
out in the 290–303 K range at fixed pH = 6.0, solution volume
= 30 mL, contact time = 4 h, nanohybrid mass = 1 mg, GO/O-CNT ratio
= 1/1, and %CaCl2= 2.0%. For optimization of solution pH,
different pH values in the range 2–11 were used at fixed contact
time = 4 h, solution volume = 30 mL, temperature = 17 °C, nanohybrid
mass = 1 mg, GO/O-CNT ratio = 1/1, and %CaCl2= 2.0%. For
optimization of the CaCl2 cross-linker, different concentrations
were used (0.5, 2, and 4%) at fixed pH = 6.0, solution volume = 30
ml, contact time = 4 h, nanohybrid mass = 1 mg, temperature = 17 °C,
and GO/O-CNT ratio = 1/1. Finally, for optimization of the GO/O-CNT
ratio, different ratios of GO to O-CNTs were used (1/2, 1/3, 1/4,
1/1, 2/1, 3/1, and 4/1) at fixed pH = 6.0, solution volume = 30 mL,
contact time = 4 h, nanohybrid mass = 1 mg, temperature = 17 °C,
and %CaCl2 = 2.0%.

Desorption Process
Desorption of adsorbed drugs on
the surface of the adsorbent is a particularly important step toward
the reuse of the adsorbent over and over in the drug eradication process.
This permits the reuse of nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs several times to remove
the ciprofloxacin drug from aqueous solutions. For this purpose, 500
mg of nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs was immersed in 500 mL of 0.4 M NaOH solution
and allowed to mix overnight at ambient temperature; then, the nanohybrid
was decanted and washed several times with distilled water to remove
traces of the ciprofloxacin drug. Nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs was dried and
stored until reused again.51

Results
and Discussion
Structural Composition
Carboxylic-functionalized
graphene
and carbon nanotubes were observed and identified through the Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) technique. Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra of graphene oxide
(GO), oxidized carbon nanotubes (O-CNTs), and nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs.
In addition, Table 1 illustrates the characteristic vibrational assignments and their
corresponding wavenumbers. In graphene oxide, a broad peak of the
hydroxyl (OH) group at 3447 cm–1, peaks of asymmetric
and symmetric carboxylate (COO–) groups at 1632
and 1385 cm–1, carbonyl (C=O) group at 1711
cm–1, and epoxy groups (COC) at 1031 cm–1 proved the successful oxidation process of graphene. Moreover, the
peak of delocalized C=C stretching at 1645 cm–1 proved the accomplished oxidation process without complete destruction
of the graphene carbon skeleton. This is a very critical step because
in some oxidation processes, a collapse of the carbon skeleton of
nanoparticles may occur. Likewise, in oxidized carbon nanotubes (O-CNTs),
peaks of dense hydroxyl (OH) groups at 3451 cm–1, respective asymmetric and symmetric carboxylate (COO–) groups at 1625 and 1385 cm–1, carbonyl (C=O)
group at 1709 cm–1 and epoxy groups (COC) at 1080
cm–1 demonstrated the complete oxidation process
of CNTs. In addition, the appearance of a dense delocalized C=C
peak at 1649 cm–1 endorsed the retained carbon skeleton
of CNTs during the oxidation process. Nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs equally
shows the functional groups of GO and O-CNTs. Cross-linking of carboxyl
groups (COO–) of GO and O-CNTs via Ca2+ ions was established by a decrease in the intensity of asymmetric
and symmetric COO– peaks and an instantaneous increase
in the intensity of the carbonyl (C=O) peak (Figure 2).

Thermal Stability
The thermal stability of compounds
was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and its derivative
thermogravimetry (DTG) technique evaluated the ability of the sample
to withstand elevated temperatures until it decomposed. The midpoint
peak of DTG thermograms shows the decomposition temperature and displays
the thermal stability of samples. Figure 3A,B shows the TGA and DTG thermograms of
graphene oxide (GO), oxidized carbon nanotubes (O-CNTs), and nanohybrid
GO/O-CNTs, respectively. Two decomposition temperatures of GO are
observed at 225 and 680 °C, respectively. The peak below 100
°C is attributed to adsorbed water on the surface of GO. The
peak at 225 °C is assigned to pyrolysis of labile oxygen functional
groups, such as CO2, CO, gases, and steam.52−54 The peak at 680 °C is due to the destruction of the carbon
skeleton of graphene oxide.55 In contrast,
oxidized carbon nanotubes display no degradation temperature up to
900 °C, as observed in the DTG thermogram (Figure 3B), which confirms the absence of disordered
carbon responsible for degradation and the presence of a tough carbon
skeleton during the oxidation process.56 It may also indicate that the oxidation process occurs on the external
surface of carbon nanotubes, as evidenced by FTIR spectra. On the
other hand, nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs displays the onset of decomposition
at 250 °C and its end at 450 °C with the midpoint peak of
decomposition at 350 °C for different GO:O-CNTs ratios (Figure 3B). During the cross-linking
of carboxylate groups (COO–) of GO with the carboxylate
groups (COO–) of O-CNTs, the decomposition temperature
of the labile oxygen groups in GO increased from 225 to 350 °C,
and moreover, the peak at 680 °C disappeared in the nanohybrid
samples. This demonstrated that the thermal stability of GO sheets
increased due to cross-linking with O-CNT cylinders at all GO:O-CNTs
ratios of the nanohybrid.

(GO), oxidized
carbon nanotubes (O-CNTs), and nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs (1:1, 2:1, and
1:2 ratios).

Crystal Structure and Interlayer
Spacings
The crystal
structure of the new nanohybrid materials was identified from X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns. The spacing between the crystal planes
of graphene, graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), oxidized carbon
nanotubes (O-CNTs), and nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs was calculated using
Bragg’s equation as follows 2  where n is chosen as 1, λ
is the X-ray wavelength taken as 1.5406 Å using Cu Kα radiation,
θ is Bragg’s angle, and d is the interlayer
spacing between crystal planes. A distinctive diffraction peak (002)
of graphene at 26.14° with an interlayer spacing of 3.4 Å
corresponds to hexagonal crystalline graphite57 between graphene nanosheets, as illustrated in Figure 4. However, GO displays two
lower intensity peaks at 11.55 and 23.00o with interlayer
spacings of 7.7 and 3.9 Å, which match with hexagonal crystalline
graphite. The interlayer spacing between crystalline planes alters
with the degree of oxidation; the higher level of oxidation of GO
yields several functional groups on the surface of GO and, subsequently,
larger interlayer spacings between GO nanosheets.58,59 The appearance of broad peaks with wider interlayer spacing values
indicates the formation of irregular disordered structures due to
labile oxygen functional groups on the surface of GO nanosheets. Moreover,
CNTs have two peaks at 25.66 and 43.38°, representing the (002)
hexagonal graphite and the (100) diffraction of graphite.60 Likewise, O-CNTs have the same two peaks appearing
in CNTs with higher intensity values. The increase in the intensity
of peaks for O-CNTs provides evidence for the successful oxidation
process, and the identical peak angles for O-CNTs and CNTs prove that
the crystal structure is not affected by the oxidation process.50 Nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs shows two peaks at 24.7
and 42.9°, regardless of the ratio of GO to O-CNTs. These diffraction
peaks correlate with the (002) and (100) crystal planes.61 Peak broadening of nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs is attributed
to the crystalline defects and disordered structures and to the exfoliation
process that occurs during the formation of nanohybrids.59,62

oxide (GO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), oxidized carbon nanotubes (O-CNTs),
and nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs (1:2, 1:1, and 2:1 ratios).

Topology
The topological structure and morphological
changes of nanoscale adsorbents were monitored using the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) technique. Graphene shows two-dimensional
nanosheets stacked above each other with 1–2 μm flake
size and versatile flake thickness (Figure 5A). However, graphene oxide shows 2D nanosheets
but with exfoliated flakes. The exfoliation occurs due to crystalline
defects that appear on the nanohybrid surface during the oxidation
process (Figure 5B).
The thin GO flakes hold hydroxyl, carboxyl, and epoxy functional groups
on their inner and outer surfaces. On the other hand, oxidized multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (O-CNTs) show cylindrical-shaped nanotubes that hold
labile oxygen functional groups (i.e., hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl,
and epoxy) on their surfaces (Figure 5C). When cylindrical O-CNTs are cross-linked with sheets
of GO via Ca2+ ions, the carboxyl groups of GO and O-CNTs
bind through the cross-linking agent (Ca2+). The threads
of O-CNTs settle down on the surface of the GO sheets, as demonstrated
in Figures 5D,E. Likewise,
at the 1:4 ratio, a higher content of threads of O-CNTs are cross-linked
with GO nanosheets (Figure 5F).

Optimum Parameters for Ultimate Eradication
Versatile
parameters and conditions were designed to inspect the optimum conditions
for ultimate eradication of drugs from aqueous solutions. For this
purpose, batch adsorption experiments were processed, and the parameters
were investigated in the following order: contact time, nanohybrid
mass, temperature, solution pH, percent of cross-linking agent (%CaCl2), and the ratio of GO to O-CNTs in the nanohybrid structure.

Contact Time, Nanohybrid Mass, and Solution Temperature
The influence of contact time, nanohybrid mass, and solution temperature
was investigated for ultimate eradication of the ciprofloxacin drug
from aqueous solutions (Figure 6A–C). For this purpose, different contact times of
drug with the nanohybrid adsorbent were selected. Clearly, drug uptake
increased exponentially in the first 4 h until an equilibrium was
established. Quick drug uptake occurred within the first 4 h, followed
by slow equilibrium drug uptake. Quick drug uptake occurred due to
the existence of many vacant sites for adsorption with no internal
resistance for diffusion.63 Beyond 4 h,
the slow drug uptake was due to slow saturated diffusion to less accessible
sites.64,65 Therefore, 4 h was selected as the optimum
time for equilibrium (Figure 6A). As shown in Figure 6B, variable nanohybrid masses in the range of 1–5 mg
were used for the eradication process; the 1 mg sample removed almost
twice the amount of drug compared with the 2 mg sample. Apparently,
with a higher nanohybrid mass, chains of GO and O-CNTs established
intermolecular interactions and accumulated above each other, thus
covering many of the active sites, which inhibited drug uptake. In
addition, for temperature optimization, batch adsorption experiments
were carried out in the 290–303 K range. Obviously, as the
temperature increased, the drug uptake decreased. This was due to
the increased kinetic energy of the surface of nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs
and the ciprofloxacin molecules in solution, which depleted the drug
uptake and minimized the adsorbent–adsorbate interactions.66

drug on

6.0, solution volume = 30 ml, contact time = 4 h, nanohybrid mass

Solution pH, %Cross-linking Agent, and GO/O-CNT
Ratio
The influence of solution pH on the drug uptake was
investigated
in the range pH = 2–11 (Figure 6D). Drug uptake shows a distribution curve over the
pH range with the maximum uptake at pH = 6.0. Adsorption of ciprofloxacin
on the surface of nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs occurs via H-bonding and/or
π–π stacking interactions. Furthermore, the ciprofloxacin
drug has two pKa values of 5.9 and 8.9.67 At pH < 5.9, ciprofloxacin is protonated
and holds positive charges, and at pH > 8.9, ciprofloxacin is deprotonated
and holds negative charges. In both cases, the presence of charges
weakens and diminishes H-bonding interactions between ciprofloxacin
molecules and the surface of nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs, which lowers the
drug uptake. In the pH 6–7 range, the ciprofloxacin drug becomes
chargeless and the strongest H-bonding with the adsorbent surface
occurs; hence, the maximum drug uptake takes place.

The effect
of concentration of the cross-linking agent (%CaCl2) in
the nanohybrid and its relation to drug uptake is investigated in Figure 6E. Clearly, the increase
in concentration of CaCl2 in the nanohybrid backbone structure
leads to a large decrease in the drug uptake due to the formation
of small-sized nanochannels in the GO networks that eliminate sorbed
water68 and, certainly, prevent larger
molecules, such as the ciprofloxacin drug, from being adsorbed on
the inner layers of the nanohybrid adsorbent. Furthermore, the variable
ratios of GO to O-CNTs in the nanohybrid give rise to different microstructures
that show versatile drug uptake, as described in Figure 6F. The maximum drug uptake
of 512 mg/g was obtained using 1:4 ratio of GO to O-CNTs. Apparently,
the 1:1 ratio shows the lowest drug uptake due to cooperatively strengthened
OH...O=C hydrogen bonds that align
and assemble O-CNT cylinders on GO sheets and hence decrease their
surface area for drug uptake,69 as observed
in the SEM image (Figure 5F).

Ultimate Eradication of Ciprofloxacin from
Aqueous Solutions
The ultimate eradication of the drug is
an extremely essential
part in this study, not only due to the importance of drug eradication
from aqueous solutions but also due to the significance of fighting
against the generated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the human
body. The generated AMR will ultimately lead to drug deactivation
in the human body and to massive number of deaths associated with
generated AMR.14 To investigate the entire
eradication process of the drug, different initial concentrations
of the drug (5–15 ppm) and different nanohybrid adsorbent masses
(1–5 mg) were used (Figure 7A). The removal efficiency (in %) was calculated with
respect to the initial concentration of the drug under optimum conditions.
Obviously, a high removal efficiency was obtained using a high nanohybrid
mass and low initial concentration of the drug. The maximum efficiency
for the entire removal process was 99.2% at 5 ppm of the drug using
5 mg of the nanohybrid adsorbent.

Regeneration
of Nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs
Batch adsorption
experiments on the regenerated adsorbent have proved the possible
regeneration of nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs for multiple adsorption–desorption
processes. The average removal efficiency of three tested samples
of the regenerated adsorbent was reduced only by 2.0% compared to
the original fresh adsorbent. This also reflected the high structural
stability of the nanohybrid adsorbent against continuous washing with
basic aqueous solutions.

Ciprofloxacin Eradication Dynamics
Versatile models
for drug eradication dynamics were investigated, and the drug uptake
proved to be a pseudo-second-order model, with the correlation coefficient
value (R2) exceeding
0.99. The second-order model is as follows 3  where qe is the
equilibrium drug uptake (in mg/g), qt is the drug uptake at time t (in
mg/g), k2 is the rate constant of drug
uptake (in g/mg min), and t is the time (in min).70 By plotting t/qt against time t, the
equilibrium drug uptake (qe) and the rate
constant of removal (k2) were determined
(Table 2). The calculated
equilibrium drug uptake (qe) was 250 mg/g,
and the rate constant of removal (k2)
was 4.71 × 10–4 g/mg min with a correlation
coefficient (R2) of 0.996
(Figure 7B).

Table 2 Kinetic Rate Constants for Ciprofloxacin
Removal Using a Pseudo-Second-Order Kinetic Model
qe,exp (mg/g)	k2 (g/mg min)	qe,cal (mg/g)	R2	
232.8	4.71 × 10–4	250.0	0.996	
Furthermore,
the mechanism of drug adsorption was validated using
the intraparticle diffusion model.71 4  where kp is the
intraparticle diffusion constant (in mg/g min0.5), and C is the adsorption constant (in mg/g). Plots of qt versus t1/2 in Figure 7C show two different straight lines, which suggest an intraparticle
diffusion mechanism and prove that many steps control the overall
drug uptake process.72 The steps include
quick external pore diffusion (film diffusion) followed by slow sorption
on the internal pore surface of the nanohybrid adsorbent (pore diffusion).73

The Boyd model74 was used to determine
the rate-controlling step of the adsorption process75 as follows 5   6  where F is the
equilibrium fractional attainment calculated from eq 5, B is the time
constant (in 1/min), and Bt is calculated from eq 6. According to the Boyd model, the plot of
Bt versus t that forms a straight line and passes
through the origin is direct proof that the adsorption process is
controlled by the intraparticle diffusion mechanism. Otherwise, the
film diffusion step is the rate-determining step. Our results show
that the straight lines of all drug uptake processes do not pass through
the origin, which suggests that the drug uptake process is controlled
by rapid external pore diffusion (the film diffusion step)72,76

Ciprofloxacin Eradication Isotherms
Isothermal determination
of the amount of drug adsorbed on the surface of an adsorbent can
be best described by adsorption isotherms. In general, the number
of vacant active sites and the size of pores on the surface of the
adsorbent play major role in the determination of the amount of drug
adsorbed. Four adsorption models were applied to the adsorption of
the ciprofloxacin drug on the surface of the nanohybrid GO/O-CNT system:
Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherms,
respectively. The adsorption isotherms exhibited linear curves with
the highest correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.97–0.98. The linearized form of the Langmuir isotherm
is as follows 7  where qmax is
the maximum amount of drug adsorbed by a complete monolayer, qe is the equilibrium drug uptake (in mg/g), Ce is the equilibrium concentration of the drug
(in mg/L), and KL is the equilibrium constant
of adsorption (L/kg). The plot of Ce/qe versus Ce forms
a linear curve, for which the constants, qmax and KL, are calculated.71 Furthermore, the Langmuir adsorption isotherm for the ciprofloxacin
drug at various temperatures is shown in Figure 7. The maximum drug uptake was found to decrease
from 270.3 to 227.3 mg/g as the temperature increased from 290 to
303 K. Likewise, the equilibrium constant (KL) values decreased as the temperature increased (Table 3). Obviously, as the
temperature increased, the kinetic energy of the drug molecules increased
and also the kinetic energy of the surface of the adsorbent increased,
which weakened the drug adsorption and led to fewer drug molecules
adsorbed on the hot surfaces of the adsorbent.

On the
other hand, the Freundlich isotherm equation is as follows 8  where qe is the
equilibrium uptake (mg/g), KF is the Freundlich
constant related to the adsorption capacity ((mg(1–1/n) L(1/n))/g), Ce is the equilibrium concentration of the drug (mg/L), and n is the heterogeneity factor.77 The plot of ln qe versus ln Ce forms a linear curve.71Table 3 shows the Freundlich parameters along with the correlation
coefficients (R2).

For the Temkin
isotherm, the linear form is as follows 9  where qe is the
equilibrium uptake (mg/g), BT = RT/bT, where bT is the Temkin constant related to the heat of adsorption
(J/mol), R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol.K), T is the temperature (K), Ce is the equilibrium concentration of the drug (in mg/L), and KT is the maximum binding energy constant (L/mg).
The plot of qe versus ln Ce forms a linear curve.71Table 3 illustrates
the adsorption isotherm parameters along with the correlation coefficients
(R2). As can be noted, all three models
could fit the experimental data.

The Dubinin–Radushkevich
(D–R) linear form is as
follows 10  where qe is the
equilibrium uptake (mg/g), β is the mean free energy (mol2/kJ2), ε is the , where R is the universal
gas constant (8.314 J/mol.K), T is the temperature
(K), Ce is the equilibrium concentration
of the drug (in mg/L), and E is the free energy (kJ/mol)
equal to . The plot of qe versus ε2 forms a linear curve.78 Experimental determination of ciprofloxacin
uptake by various
adsorbents is discussed in Table 4.

Ciprofloxacin Eradication Thermodynamics
Many important
outputs can be extracted from the thermodynamic parameters, such as
how strongly the adsorbate attaches to the surface of the adsorbent
(i.e., chemisorption or physisorption process), exothermic or endothermic
processes, and entropic changes that occur throughout the adsorption
process. The adsorption process is considered to be physisorption
when the ΔG° value is around 20 kJ/mol
and chemisorption when the value is 80–400 kJ/mol.89 Results of ciprofloxacin removal illustrated
in Table 5 suggest
that the adsorption of the drug on the nanohybrid adsorbent is physisorption.
The thermodynamic parameters could be determined using eq 10 as follows 11  where KL is the
equilibrium constant determined from the Langmuir adsorption isotherms, R is the universal gas constant, T is the
absolute temperature of adsorption (K). The plot
of ln KL versus reciprocal temperature
(1/T) yields the enthalpy change (ΔH°) and entropy change (ΔS°)
from the slope and intercept, respectively (Figure 7F), and the Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) values are calculated from ΔG° = −RT ln KL.90

303	227.3	1.97 × 105	–30.71	 	 	
a qmax and KL values were
determined from the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.

Furthermore, the exothermic enthalpy
change (ΔH°) value pointed to the successful
bond formation of the drug
with the nanohybrid adsorbent at the interface, and the positive entropy
change (ΔS°) value indicated an entropy
increase as a result of the adsorption process.91

Conclusions
In this article, new
nanohybrid adsorbents were synthesized and
characterized for ultimate eradication of the ciprofloxacin antibiotic
from aqueous solutions. Nanohybrid GO/O-CNTs was composed of graphene
oxide (GO) cross-linked via calcium ions (Ca2+) with oxidized
carbon nanotubes (O-CNTs) in a water-dispersed Tween 80 solution.
The nanohybrid adsorbents were characterized using spectroscopic,
thermal, and microscopic (FTIR, TGA, DTG, XRD, and SEM) techniques.
The new nanohybrid was validated for ultimate eradication of the ciprofloxacin
antibiotic from aqueous solutions. The ciprofloxacin antibiotic drug
is medically prescribed in millions of medical prescriptions every
year and hence exists in sewage treatment effluents, wastewaters,
and domestic waters. Optimum parameters were validated for the eradication
process, such as contact time, nanohybrid mass, solution temperature,
solution pH, %cross-linking agent, and GO/O-CNT ratio. Ciprofloxacin
removal dynamics displayed a pseudo-second-order fit with an intraparticle
diffusion mechanism. Thermodynamic parameters of ciprofloxacin removal
revealed a physisorption process and confirmed a simple desorption
process. Our results provided outstanding drug eradication of up to
99.2% and ultimate drug uptake of 512 mg/g. In conclusion, the ultimate
eradication of drugs from aqueous solutions is a proactive step in
the right direction against the generated antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) in the human body that may increase with time and, eventually,
lead to disastrous deaths and epidemics.
