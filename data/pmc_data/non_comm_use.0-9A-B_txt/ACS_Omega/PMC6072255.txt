Drug–polymer conjugation is
a simple and efficient approach
to synthesizing new, effective, and potent antimicrobial agents to
counter the problem of microbial resistance. In the present study,
a PEGylated dopamine ester (PDE) was synthesized using the PEGylation
process and synthesis of PDE was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy, elemental analysis (CHNS–O), and atomic force
microscopy techniques. Later, the antimicrobial activity of PDE was
assessed against four strains of bacteria (Bacillus
subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris; Gram (−)) and two fungi
(Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus) by the agar well diffusion
method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of PDE was also
determined by the broth dilution method against bacteria. PDE showed
significant zones of inhibition ranged from 21 to 27 mm for bacteria
and 16 to 20 mm for fungi under study, which were much higher than
those for dopamine hydrochloride. MIC values of PDE showed its potential
antimicrobial property.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Over the past few decades,
microbial resistance against antibiotics
has emerged as a major health concern with World Health Organization
reporting that most of the of the bacterial strains have acquired
resistance to commonly used antibiotics especially in the developing
countries.1 This grave global public health
threat has set an agenda for researchers to develop new compounds
or modify the existing materials with effective and potent antimicrobial
properties.

Nowadays, newer strategies have been developed to
synthesize more
efficient materials having enhanced antimicrobial property to counter
pathogenic microbial strains.2 Many researchers
reported various modified antimicrobial agents having silver,3 titanium,4 copper,5 iron,6 phenols,7 aldehydes,8N-halamines,9 etc. However, due
to their serious disadvantages such as high residual toxicity, environmental
hazards, etc., focus has been shifted to polymeric systems, which
can act as a support to other antimicrobial agents with enhanced antimicrobial
properties or themselves act as strong antimicrobial agents.10 The latter include antimicrobial polymers (AMPs),
which have numerous active groups, high efficacy, diminutive toxicity,
broad spectrum applicability, easy introduction, and simple modification
of structural and functional properties.11,12 The availability of the large number of active groups creates high
local concentration, which in turn improves antimicrobial properties
many times.13 Moreover, AMPs can be easily
tailored by polymer analogous reactions including metathesis reactions
to enhance their efficacy.14,15

Furthermore,
modification of the existing drugs by drug–polymer
conjugation through various chemical reactions such as acrylation,
acetylation, or quaternization reactions depends upon the nature or
potency of the active functional groups present on the bioactive polymer.16 One way forward is functionalization of the
existing drugs such as methyl DOPA,17 promethazine,18 chlorpromazine,19 diclofenac,20 oxyphedrine,21 dicyclomine,22 and
dopamine hydrochloride23 as these possess
antimicrobial activity in addition to their predesigned pharmacological
actions.

In view of the above discussion, the rationale of the
present research
is to design a novel, effective, and potent antibacterial and antifungal
agent by functionalization of dopamine hydrochloride using the PEGylation
process and compare its antimicrobial properties with those of dopamine
hydrochloride and some existing drugs as references. Surface modification
and functionalization of antibiotics or bioactive compounds via a
greener route is a new strategy that can enhance the antimicrobial
property of the antimicrobial agents. Poly(ethylene glycols) (PEGs)
are highly biocompatible and safe polymers reported in drug delivery.24 Various bioactive compounds especially polymers
having active functional groups can be covalently attached to different
drugs via a greener approach. In the literature, it is reported that
various dopamine-containing compounds exhibit antibacterial activities25−28 and dopamine also
had been used to synthesize numerous herbicides and drugs.29,30 Dopamine ester derivatives have been reported to have better antibacterial
properties than those of dopamine.31 These
characteristics make dopamine or its derivatives a suitable drug for
surface modification using a polymer system to develop an effective
antimicrobial agent. Hence, the polydopamine coatings of dopamine
for surface modification of various materials, formed by single-step
autoxidation of dopamine, have recently emerged as an attractive methodology
and become a very hot field of scientific technological innovation.32 The self-polymerization of dopamine requires
alkaline conditions in the presence of oxygen.33 Although dopamine itself has very moderate efficacy to
kill the pathogens, its functionalization improves the efficiency
against the pathogens.32

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Modification of Dopamine
to a PEGylated Dopamine
Ester (PDE)
The vicinal hydroxyl groups (−OH) of dopamine
were functionalized with free −COOH groups of PEG diacid, which
resulted in the formation of ester linkage (−COO−) between
dopamine and PEG diacid via acid esterification i.e., in the presence
of H2SO4, presented in Scheme 1. There was a formation of ester moiety in
the PDE with the removal of water molecule. Dopamine undergoes self-polymerization
in the presence of oxygen in an alkaline environment. However, at
acidic pH (<7), the self-polymerization is not possible without
any initiators or catalysts and it needs high temperature and pressure.
Hence, under the reported synthetic conditions, dopamine does not
undergo self-polymerization in the presence of oxygen.34

Scheme 1 Synthesis of PDE
Thus, a dangling structure with highly biocompatible PEG
and bioactive
DOPA moieties on sides is generated.

2.2 Characterization
of Modified Dopamine (PDE)
2.2.1 Elemental Analysis (CHNS–O)
In the case of dopamine hydrochloride, the elemental composition
has been reported to be: carbon (50.67%), hydrogen (6.38%), nitrogen (7.39%), and oxygen
(18.69%).35 CHNS–O analysis of PDE
is presented in Figure 1a, wherein the concentration of oxygen is 31.32%, which confirmed that the addition
of the PEG diacid polymer to dopamine molecules increased the oxygen
concentration, but it was lower than 34.77% in the CHNS–O analysis
of PEG diacid (Figure 1b). This confirmed the removal of water molecules in the esterification
process because of the decreased oxygen concentration in the dopamine
ester than in PEG diacid.

Figure 1 (a) CHNS–O analysis of PDE and (b) PEG
diacid.

2.2.2 Fourier-Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy
(FTIR) and Raman Spectrum Analysis
FTIR spectra of dopamine
and PDE were recorded to confirm the formation of ester linkage in
dopamine. The peaks observed in the FTIR spectra of dopamine were
at 3346 cm–1 (amine N–H stretching), 3270
cm–1 (phenol O–H stretching), 3050.77 cm–1 (aromatic C–H stretching), 2916.77 cm–1 (alkyl C–H stretching), 1616 cm–1 (amine N–H bending), 1519 cm–1 (aromatic
C=C stretching), 1245 cm–1 (amine C–N
stretching), 1230 cm–1 (phenol C–O stretching)
(Figure 2).36 The FTIR spectrum of PDE showed peaks at 1720
cm–1 (ester C=O stretching) and 1120 cm–1 (ester C–O stretching) with basic peaks of
dopamine, which confirmed the successful incorporation of the ester
moiety in dopamine to form PDE (Figure 2).

Figure 2 (a) FTIR spectra of dopamine and PDE. (b) Raman spectra
of PDE.

Figure 2b shows
the Raman spectrum of PDE. The two bands at around 1300–1400
and 1500–1600 cm–1 (D and G bands), due to
the catechol group, in the Raman spectrum of dopamine disappeared in the Raman spectrum
of PDE, which depicts the utilization of the −OH group for
the formation of dopamine ester.37 The
band at 1100 cm–1 in PDE was attributed to the CH
twisting, NH twisting, and CN stretching.38

2.2.3 Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Analysis
AFM is a versatile and powerful microscopy technology that can
generate images at atomic resolution with Å scale. AFM topographic
images of PDE show spherical granules having size of particles on
microscale, shown in Figure 3. The microspherical particles with rough surfaces have increased
contact between the microbial cell and PDE, which increases the killing
efficiency of PDE toward bacteria.

Figure 3 AFM images of PDE.

2.3 Antimicrobial Studies
In this study,
four bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris) and two fungi (Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus), all of
pathogenic nature,39−43 were selected for evaluating the antimicrobial activity of PDE and
precursor dopamine as the reference and ampicillin as the standard
drug control. These microorganisms were allowed to grow on agar plates,
and the zone of inhibition was measured after an incubation period
of 24 and 48 h for bacteria and fungi, respectively, under optimum
conditions of growth. Ampicillin was used as a standard antibacterial
and antifungal drug. The antimicrobial activity assay of PDE was carried
out by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method (Figure 4). Images of antibacterial
and antifungal activity of dopamine, PDE, and ampicillin revealed
that PDE exhibits potent antimicrobial activity than dopamine and
control ampicillin.

Figure 4 Images of antibacterial and antifungal activity of dopamine,
PDE,
and ampicillin (product in the pictures indicates PDE).

2.3.1 Zone of Inhibition
The diameter
of zone of inhibition was found to be microorganism-dependent, and
crucial structure–activity relationship was seen from the trends
in the antimicrobial action of PDE. PDE (1.0 μL) in 1.0 mL of
water was taken to evaluate its antibacterial activity and found to
be more active against Gram (+) bacteria than Gram (−) bacteria.
This can be better explained on the basis of difference in their cell
wall compositions. In addition to the peptidoglycan in the cell walls,
Gram (−) bacteria have an additional outer membrane, contain
higher lipid contents, and are more hydrophilic than Gram (+) bacteria;
thus, they are less susceptible to antibiotics. On the other hand,
the wall of fungal cell is more complex than the bacterial cell wall
and comprises chitin, glucans, and polysaccharides. Therefore, due
to structure complexity of the fungal cell wall, lesser diameter of
zone of inhibition was observed as compared to that in bacteria. Dopamine
does not show antimicrobial activity up to 5 mg/mL to test organisms
(Figure 4). Thus, the
ester linkage is established
as the necessary structural factor for antimicrobial activity.

The mechanism of antimicrobial action of PDE is suggested via cell
wall lysis as is the case with biocidal amines. Cell wall lysis is
associated with the attachment and penetration of antimicrobial agents,
PDE in this case, through cell membranes and results in cell death
by disruption or release of intracellular fluid.6,26,32 Therefore, extent of interaction directly
influences the killing efficiency. The PDE has microspherical particles
with a rough surface, as shown by the AFM studies, which facilitates
effective interaction between PDE and bacterial cell membranes, which
is further enhanced by the PEGylation of dopamine because of the introduction
of synthesized ester of lipophilic nature, and PDE kills various microbes
effectively than pristine dopamine. PDE showed prominent zones of
inhibition of 22.25 ± 1.75, 27.00 ± 1.00, and 21.00 ±
1.25, 24.50 ± 1.75 mm against Gram (+) bacteria (B. subtilis and S. aureus) and Gram (−) bacteria (P. aeruginosa and P. vulgaris), respectively, and
20 ± 1.00 and 16.25 ± 1.00 mm against A.
niger and A. fumigatus, respectively. No zone of inhibition was seen with dopamine hydrochloride
against the reported bacteria and fungi. Moderate zones of inhibition
of 18.25 ± 1.25 and 21.25 ± 1.00 mm were shown by ampicillin
against B. subtilis and S. aureus, respectively (Table 1, Figure 4).

2.3.2 MIC Studies
MIC is defined as the
lowest amount (mg/L) of antimicrobial agent required to impede the
visible growth of microorganisms under defined growth conditions.
In the present protocol, we used the non-fluorescent resazurin (purple
blue) dye as a redox indicator. The cytochrome reductases of live
or active microbial cells left in Sterile 96-well microtitration plates
reduce the resazurin dye to fluorescent resorufin (pink) dye, giving
a direct measure of the metabolic activity of bacterial cells.44 Hence, if there is no reduction of dye by bacteria,
then the color remains as such i.e., no growth of bacterial cells
and vice-versa. MIC values of PDE were determined for selected pathogenic
bacterial strains and fungi. S. species, P. vulgaris, B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi were found
to be the most sensitive to PDE with the MIC value of 0.156/100 μL.
The MIC value for Escherichia coli, S. aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae was found to be 0.312/100 μL, and dopamine hydrochloride showed
the MIC value of 10 mg/100 μL only against P.
vulgaris and Benthesicymus cereus (Tables 2, 3 and Figure 5). A. niger and A. fumigatus both were found to be highly sensitive
to PDE with MIC values 0.078/100 and 0.156/100 μL, respectively,
and for dopamine hydrochloride, MIC values were found to be 2.5/100
μL for A. niger and 5.0/100 μL
for A. fumigatus, shown in Table 4 and Figure 6.

3 Conclusions
In this study, a new bioactive compound of dopamine (PDE) was synthesized
by the PEGylation process, in which polymer chains of poly(ethylene
glycol) were covalently attached to dopamine hydrochloride. Furthermore,
synthesis of PDE was successfully confirmed by FTIR, elemental analysis,
and AFM techniques. Later, antimicrobial activity of PDE was evaluated
against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Results obtained from the agar
well diffusion method revealed that PDE showed strong antimicrobial
activity against bacteria and fungi under study, and these results
were close to those of the control. However, dopamine hydrochloride
did not show any zone of inhibition against bacteria and fungi. Moreover, P. vulgaris and P. aeruginosa were resistant to the control antibiotic, but their growth was significantly
affected by PDE. In view of the aforesaid, PDE is an efficient and
potent antimicrobial agent having MIC values of 0.156/100 and 0.312/100
μL in case of bacteria and 2.5/100 and 5.0/100 μL in case
of fungi and can be used in cosmetics, as a food packaging material,
and in pharmaceutical industries.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Dopamine hydrochloride
and sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3) (Hi media, India),
PEG-bis (carboxymethyl) ether (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), sulfuric acid
(H2SO4, Rankem, India), peptone, sodium chloride
(NaCl), galactose, calcium chloride (CaCl2), Tween-80,
and resazurine dye (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) were of analytical grade
and used as received. Beef extract, nutrient agar, potato dextrose
agar, yeast extract (Hi media, India), and test organisms including
Gram (+) and Gram (−) strains of bacteria (B.
subtilis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, P.
vulgaris, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. ssp, B. cereus, and S.
typhi) and two fungal cultures (A.
niger and A. fumigatus) were obtained from the Department of Biotechnology, Himachal Pradesh
University, Shimla, India.

4.2 Synthesis of PEGylated
Dopamine Ester (PDE)
Dopamine hydrochloride (1.0 g) was mixed
with 2.0 mL of PEG-bis(carboxymethyl)
ether in a flask placed in a water bath at 40–50 °C for
20 h, and 5–6 drops of H2SO4 were added
to accelerate the reaction. After the completion of the reaction,
PDE was formed, which was then washed by dropwise addition of 10%
solution of NaHCO3 until effervescence ceased, which indicated
complete removal of the acid. It was then dried at 50 °C in the
oven to evaporate water.

4.3 Antimicrobial Assay
The antimicrobial
activity of PDE was determined by the agar well diffusion method,
and the lowest concentration of the test material that inhibited the
visible growth of microbes i.e., MIC, was calculated using the broth
dilution method.45

4.3.1 Agar
Well Diffusion Method
The
bactericidal and fungicidal effects of dopamine and PDE were tested
against two Gram (+) (B. subtilis and S. aureus) two Gram (−) (P.
aeruginosa, P. vulgaris) bacteria and two fungi (A. niger and A. fumigatus). Antimicrobial
susceptibility was tested on solid agar–agar media in petriplates.46 For this, 5.0 g of beef extract, 1.0 g of yeast
extract, 2.5 g of NaCl, and 5.0 g of peptone were added in 500 mL
of distilled water. The pH of the mixture solution was maintained
at 7.5. To this solution, 13.0 g of agar was added and autoclaved
at 121 °C for 45–60 min to obtain nutrient agar media,
which was then poured onto petriplates. In each nutrient agar plate,
different bacterial cultures were spread. Thereafter, three wells
were punctured into each agar plate and ampicillin (0.025 g/500 μL),
PDE (10 μL/10 mL), and dopamine (1 mg/1 mL) were poured into
each well. In each well, 100 μL dopamine, PDE, and ampicillin
were added separately. The resulting uniform circular areas as zones
of inhibition around the wells without the growth of test bacteria
were observed and measured after incubation at 37 °C for 24 h.

For the fungal production media, 3.9 g of potato dextrose agar
was added in 100 mL of distilled water and then autoclaved at 121
°C for 45–60 min. Then, the same procedure was followed
as reported above for the bacterial study.

4.3.2 Broth
Dilution Method for Determination
of the MIC of Dopamine and PDE
To make nutrient broth for
bacterial culture, 5.0 g of beef extract, 10.0 g of yeast extract,
2.5 g of NaCl, and 5.0 g of peptone were mixed in 500 mL of distilled
water and then autoclaved at 121 °C for 45–60 min. Sterile
96-well microtitration plates were used. Each well was filled with
100 μL of nutrient broth and 10 μL of test solution: dopamine
(1 mg/1 mL) and PDE (10 μL/10 mL). Broth dilution (2-fold) was
achieved in each horizontal row by transferring 10 μL of test
solution from first well to the next and similarly in subsequent wells
so that each well had 10 μL of test solution in serially descending
concentrations.47 Then, 10.0 μL of
different bacterial cultures was added in each row one by one. For
the purpose of testing, 10.0 μL of indicator (resazurine dye)
was added in each well (0.027 g/4 mL).48 One entire vertical row of negative control contains only nutrient
broth and bacteria (no antibiotic and no synthesized material). Next
to negative control, an entire vertical row with all test bacteria
had antibiotics (+ve control) instead of synthesized material was
examined. If the color of the dye changes to pink, that means the
growth of bacteria is there, and if the color is purple, then the
growth of bacteria is inhibited by the testing sample, i.e., PDE.

For production media for fungus, 3.6 g of peptone, 3.0 g of galactose,
1.0 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of CaCl2, and 2.0 mL of Tween-80 were
added in 200 mL of distilled water and the pH of the mixture solution
was maintained at 10. Then, the solution was autoclaved at 121 °C
for 45–60 min. After this, the fungus was added into this production
media and left for 3 days for proper growth. Then, the same procedure
followed as for the MIC of bacteria.
