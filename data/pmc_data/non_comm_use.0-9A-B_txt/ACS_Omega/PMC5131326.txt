Ice
crystals nucleate and grow when a water solution is cooled
below its freezing point. The growth velocities and morphologies of
the ice crystals depend on many parameters, such as the temperature
of ice growth, the melting temperature, and the interactions of solutes
with the growing crystals. Three types of morphologies may appear:
dendritic, cellular (or fingerlike), or the faceted equilibrium form.
Understanding and controlling which type of morphology is formed is
essential in several domains, from biology to geophysics and materials
science. Obtaining, in situ, three dimensional observations without
introducing artifacts due to the experimental technique is nevertheless
challenging. Here we show how we can use laser scanning confocal microscopy
to follow in real-time the growth of smoothed and faceted ice crystals
in zirconium acetate solutions. Both qualitative and quantitative
observations can be made. In particular, we can precisely measure
the lateral growth velocity of the crystals, a measure otherwise difficult
to obtain. Such observations should help us understand the influence
of the parameters that control the growth of ice crystals in various
systems.

Introduction
Understanding and controlling the growth
of crystals, and in particular
of ice crystals, is of interest in many domains, from geophysics to
biology to food engineering. In materials science, the growth of ice
crystals in colloidal suspensions is used in processing routes called
“ice templating” or “freeze-casting”,1 where the unidirectional growth of the crystals
and their successive removal by sublimation are used to template porosity
in various materials. The microstructure, architecture, and properties
of these materials are related, to some extent, to the morphology
of the crystals grown during freezing. The dimensions and shape of
ice crystals can be controlled, for example, by the cooling rate,
the temperature gradient, the concentration and the composition of
additives and particles, the pH condition, or the presence of externally
applied magnetic or electric field.2,3 The ice
crystals may exhibit three different morphologies: dendritic, cellular
(fingerlike), or smoothed and faceted structures,4 as described by Gibbs–Curie–Wulff equilibrium.5 Two such examples are given by snowflakes or
ice crystals in saline solutions.6

Several additives have been proposed to control the growth morphologies
of ice crystals, with varying degrees of success. These additives
can be water-soluble solutes (sucrose, ethanol, and glycerol)7 or polymers (PVA and PEG).8 If these additives all affect, to some extent, the freezing
point, growth kinetics, and morphologies of the ice crystals, the
latter almost always adopt cellular or dendritic morphologies. A form
of Gibbs–Curie–Wulff equilibrium could be achieved by
using ice-binding proteins in solution (also called “anti-freeze
proteins”, AFPs). Ice shaping is the result of their binding
to ice. The first proteins to be discovered were the anti-freeze glycoproteins
(AFGPs) in Antartic fishes,9−11 followed by the report of Duman
and DeVries12 of a helical peptide in the
serum of winter flounder. Both AFPs and AFGPs can control the freezing
temperature, the crystal growth, and the size of ice crystals during
freeze–thaw cycles13 in the serum
of fishes,14 insects,15 and plants16 that experience
subzero temperatures.

Zirconium acetate (ZrAc) and zirconium
hydroxyacetate (ZrHAc) are
probably the only inorganic compounds that mimic the ice-faceting
properties of AFPs.17−19 The growth of ice crystals in the presence of ZrAc
probably occurs under the Gibbs–Curie–Wulff equilibrium.
ZrAc can thus be used as a simple model system to grow faceted crystals
and measure their growth kinetics. ZrAc in water is organized as tetrameric
stacks,20 which might mimic the repetitive
motif of certain AFPs.21,22

Although several methods
have been proposed to follow the growth
of ice crystals in situ, none of them can provide three-dimensional
(3D) real-time observations without affecting the system. Optical
microscopy is limited to two-dimensional (2D) surface observations.23 Computed X-ray tomography can provide time-lapse
3D observations, but the local absorption of synchrotron X-rays increases
the temperature and affects the growth behavior and morphology of
the ice crystals.24 Optical interferometry
has been used to track the freezing front, but it cannot provide information
about the morphology of ice crystals.25 Transmission electron microscopy can be used to image the growth
of crystals and the behavior of particles repelled by the latter,
but such experiments cannot yet be run routinely and the interaction
of the electron beam with the sample is always questionable.26 Near-infrared imaging spectroscopy was used
to investigate the morphology of ice crystals in biological materials,
but freezing was not performed in situ and the spatial resolution
is still not sufficient to image small crystals.27

Here we show how confocal laser scanning microscopy
and image analysis
can be used to investigate the growth of ice crystals as small as
tens of micrometers in situ in ZrAc solutions, stained with sulforhodamine
B, in a confined thin slab. We will show that we can follow and reconstruct
the ice crystals topography and quantitatively estimate the kinetics
of the advancing ice front while freezing using a table-top instrument.

Results
Freezing
Process
We first verified that sulforhodamine
B has no effect on the morphology of the ice crystals. A sample of
60 μL of a pristine 1 mM sulforhodamine B solution was diluted
in 1 mL of deionized water. A sample of 12 μL was prepared and
frozen. The results of the 3D topography of the frozen solution at
the temperature of approximately −22 °C, cooled at Δ(T) = −1 °C/min, is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Three-dimensional topography
of brine channels (with sulforhodamine
B) in ice. Visualization of the trace of sulforhodamine B cooled from
room temperature to approximately −22 °C at the rate of
Δ(T) = −1 °C/min. The fluorophore
is expelled from the frozen water and concentrate in small rounded
pockets. Similar effect is found in freezing of salty water and the
formation of brine pockets. The pockets are aligned along the freezing
direction y. The thickness is 28 μm.

No regular structure is observable
in the sulforhodamine B trace.
As expected, water, while freezing, rejects brine, which also contains
the fluorophore accumulated at the grain boundaries.6,28,29 With the proper fluorophore,
we can thus quantitatively and thermodynamically follow the growth
of ice crystals,30 with or without ZrAc
in the solution.

The freezing of #2(TMA-OH) and #2(NaOH) solutions
was observed
as a function of time in the x–y plane at full cooling velocity to refine the sample position, to
check the extent of condensation, and to capture the longitudinal
dendritic growth of the ice crystals.

Generally no freezing
was observed until the temperature of the
Peltier stage was below −15 °C. Due to the supercooled
state of the solution, the ice initially bursts into small dendritic
crystals, which densely populate the slab, hindering any observation.
These crystals will grow until the temperature matches the equilibrium
melting temperature Tm. This obliges us
to carefully select the x–z plane to measure: to get an overall insight into the ice crystal
geometries and growth kinetics, we select a priori a plane where we
expect that the sulforhodamine B fluorescence will dominate the transparency
of the ice and that we will observe a few large crystals. Because
of the supercooling effects when cooling from room temperature, we
opted for a seeding protocol. The solution is quickly frozen to trigger
the nucleation of ice, and the sample is then brought back to a temperature
of −10 °C and thermalized for 10 min. The ice recrystallizes
at this temperature, leaving just a few crystals. We can then use
these seeds to grow larger crystals in controlled conditions.

The supercooled state can be explained by the lack of nucleation
points, the colligative depression of the freezing point caused by
the electrolyte, and the confined state of the solution (analogous
to a similar effect in very small capillaries31). We believe that due to the confinement, the nucleating water must
override a change in internal pressure. At the critical point of the
water/ice phase transition, the ice faces a density change of approximately
−8%. This change in density must be accommodated either by
changing the volume (fixed internal pressure) or by changing the internal
pressure (at fixed volume). We hypothesize that a change in internal
pressure occurs, and the excess of pressure is accommodated by lifting
the top glass slide, that is, by increasing the volume: an effect
similar to frost weathering (ice can exert pressures on the order
of thousands of bars32). Due to this supercooled
state and by observing small crystals after the freezing burst, we
speculate that in a free-falling temperature experiment there are
two stages for ice growth:33 the rapid
dendritic/cellular growth followed by an apparent regular Gibbs–Curie–Wulff
equilibrium growth when the crystal tips reach the position where T = Tm.

Imaging Ice Crystals
An example of what we can image
both in the x–z and in the x–y planes is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Two-dimensional view
of ice crystals. (a) x–z plane:
a section of #2(NaOH) frozen at a ramp rate of
Δ(T) = −1 °C/min. Temperature gradient
along z. (b) One of the possible x–y views of the same sample showing the dark
shadows of the ice crystals. Temperature gradient along y. The c- and a-axis directions
are indicated in the lower left.

The growth orientation on the x–y plane can be tilted with respect to the edge of the image
(Figure 2b). In the x–z plane, the ice crystals may
thus be probed at a certain angle, which partially explains the elongated
morphology of the crystals along the x direction
(Figure 2a).

By collecting a series of similar images of the same x–z section as a function of time (Figure 2), the growth of
ice crystals can be visualized as 3D objects (Figure 3).

time-topography
visualizing the growth of ice crystals in solution #2(NaOH) as a function
of time at the fixed cooling rate of Δ(T) =
−1 °C/min. ZT, XT, and XZ views.

We can use such series of images to measure the transversal
and
longitudinal growth velocities of the ice crystals. Let us consider
two cross sections at different times (Figure 4) of the sample shown in Figure 3. A straight line is drawn
across the border between the solution and ice such that the facet
of the ice crystal moves perpendicular to this line. The series of
frames is then resliced along the line without interpolation. The
resulting image intensity is renormalized and binarized. A simple
code written in Octavea searches for the edge
and displays the results in terms of the length of trajectory and
growth velocities.

crystal
in #2(NaOH) at the temperature rate of Δ(T)
= −1 °C/min, without preseeding. (a) At the reference
time t = 0 (b) after t = 336 s (121
frames). The white line represents the trajectory for computing the
facet velocity.

From the analysis of
several crystals grown in controlled freezing
upon seeding, we can obtain a mean value of the transverse growth
velocities υt (Table 1). For a cooling rate of Δ(T) = −1 °C/min, the growth velocity in the TMA-OH solution
is slightly lower than that in the NaOH solution. However, no differences
are found for a cooling rate of Δ(T) = −2.5
°C/min. The growth rate of the crystals in the NaOH solution
is the same for the two cooling rates. We cannot at this point conclude
whether the growth of the crystals is kinetic- or diffusion-limited.
At this stage, the liquid water surrounding the crystals is heavily
charged in solutes, which slow down the freezing. The diffusion of
the solutes is very limited because of the low temperature and the
already high solute concentration.

–1	0.10 ± 0.03	0.07 ± 0.04	
–2.5	0.10 ± 0.03	0.10 ± 0.05	
To better understand how the morphology
of the ice crystal changes
during its growth, we developed a Python code that searches for the
liquid-crystal interface. Each frame is first filtered using a Gaussian
filter that smoothens the image, which is then segmented. Isocontours
are drawn, and the largest closed one is selected as the ice crystal
area. The filter and the detection of contours are obtained from the
Skimage34 and Trackpy35 packages. The code developed to track the contours and
compute the growth velocities is available on Figshare for anyone
to review, reuse, improve, or adapt.36 In Figure 5, the evolving contours
of the central crystal from Figure 3 are shown together.

with time. #2(NaOH)
at Δ(T) = −1 °C/min. The morphology
of the crystal changes as a function of time, from quasi-triangular
to hexagonal.

The growth of the crystal
follows several steps by changing its
apparent geometry from quasi-triangular to hexagonal. The apparent
geometry depends on the viewing angle, as found previously. In Figure 6, we select five
frames from Figure 5 with different geometries.

Figure 6 Frames contours. #2(NaOH) at Δ(T) = −1
°C/min. Black lines are guides for the eyes through the different
geometries.

From these contours,
we can measure the temporal evolution of the
perimeter and area of the crystal as well as its growth velocity.

The results for four representative crystals grown from the #2(TMA-OH)
solution cooled at Δ(T) = −1 °C/min
are shown in Figure 7. The four crystals show similar growth dynamics. The same conclusion
can be drawn from the instantaneous velocity results (Figure 8). The weighted average velocity
υA is 6.1 ± 0.4 μm2/s (computed
for one of the crystals).

vs time. #2(TMA-OH)
at Δ(T) = −1 °C/min. The area was
computed for the four crystals in the inset.

Figure 8 Area velocity. #2(TMA-OH) at Δ(T) = −1
°C/min postseeded. Area velocities computed using the data in Figure 7.

Nevertheless, we should stress that because the
cooling stage does
not provide a good control of the temperature gradient, our measurements
are somewhat position-dependent.

The same procedure was used
to measure the longitudinal growth
velocities υl in both solutions. The values obtained
for the two solutions and two cooling rates are given in Table 2.

Table 2 Average υl: Δ(T) in °C/min,
υl in μm/s
Δ(T)	#2(NaOH)	#2(TMA-OH)	
–1	0.9 ± 0.4	0.9 ± 0.5	
–2.5	2.4 ± 0.5	2.4 ± 0.4	
The values of υl depend only on the cooling rates:
neither NaOH/HCl nor TMA-OH contents seem to play any role.

A typical 3D topography of ice crystals grown from the #2(TMA-OH)
solution (after final cooling at T = −21 °C)
is shown in Figure 9. Similar morphologies were obtained for all the solutions and cooling
rates.

Figure 9 Three-dimensional topography of ice crystals grown from the #2(TMA-OH)
solution cooled at Δ(T) = −1 °C/min.
The tips of the ice crystals look like sharp chisels. Front view (top)
and back view (bottom). Dimensions are 400 × 200 × 46 μm3.

A more careful observation of
single x–z images from the
3D topography shows that single crystals
can result from the effective merging of smaller ones protruding from
the cold side: the sequence in Figure 10 of six cross sections illustrates such
merging. In the first cross section (namely “frame 1”,
where Δy = 0 μm represents the beginning
of the sequence), we see three crystals, whose partial contours are
highlighted by dotted lines. Two of them are already partially merged.
At frames 18 and 47, we observe a cross section at Δy = 27.2 and 73.6 μm from the beginning, and the gap
among the three crystals closes, so that at frame 72 (Δy = 113.6 μm) only one crystal is visible. Finally,
at frame 95 (Δy = 150.4 μm), the geometry
is perfectly hexagonal and the shape and size are retained till frame
116 (Δy = 184 μm).

of ice crystals grown in the #2(TMA-OH) solution cooled at Δ(T) = −2.5 °C/min. Top to bottom: the three crystals,
highlighted by dotted contours on the top subfigure, merged into one
and through an intermediate step become a single crystal with an hexagonal
geometry.

Discussion
The
freezing point of the solution is of particular importance.
Best results, in terms of growing hexagonal crystals, can be achieved
if, after the rapid freezing due to supercooling, one is able to bring
back the solution to a temperature close to the melting point and
melt until a few small crystals remain. In this case, only the small
crystals that remain will grow and the solute concentration in the
liquid phase will closely approximate the concentration of the unfrozen
solution. A similar method is generally used, for example, to distinguish
single ice crystals grown in a solution with green fluorescent protein
(GFP) tagged AFP37,38 and to identify their positions
with respect to the ice faces. In the current experiments, we cannot
tag the ZrAc with a fluorophore because the fluorophore has to be
smaller than the tagged molecules to avoid or reduce the interference
with the kinetic and dynamic processes of freezing. Moreover, small
fluorophores (such as the pyrene-based ones39) fluoresce under UV light that is unavailable for us with the current
equipment, and tagging ZrAc with a fluorophore could limit the ability
of ZrAc to self-assemble.

To better gauge and model the ice
crystallization, the optical
vertical resolution and the ability to isolate noninteracting crystals
during freezing should be optimized. Both conditions are inherent
to the statistical analysis of velocities and morphologies. The ability
to perform experiments with different liquid slab thicknesses should
provide information on how the confinement affects the ice growth.
If colloids are added to the initial solution of ZrAc,18 the lateral ice growth is limited by the colloids
engulfed between the crystals. Here, the lateral ice growth is limited
only by the thickness of the slab and by the proximity of other ice
crystals. Moreover, it seems that ice crystals do not prefer to grow
in contact with the glass. We believe that this is caused by the generation
of brine that cannot escape because it accumulates between the ice
and the two glass faces of the freezing chamber.

Phenomenologically,
we can say that upon rapid freezing and the
subsequent thermalization (T = Tm), the mechanism of crystal growth apparently follows
the Gibbs–Curie–Wulff conditions while the crystal evolves
along the thermal gradient. The ice crystal section expands monotonically,
going through the shape change previously described, with a preference
for the x-direction. This can be explained by the
finite size of the liquid slab in the z axis, whereas
the x- and y-directions seem infinite
from the point of view of the ice crystal. It would thus be worthwhile
to compute the surface free energy of the ice when in solution with
and without ZrAc. Within our range of measurements and setup, we cannot
identify whether the accretion of crystals is diffusion-limited or
kinetic-limited.40

To perform an
optimal experiment, it is strongly needed to control
the sample temperature with great precision, on the order of less
than 0.1 °C. We observed that the vertices of the ice crystals
were the first to reshape when the temperatures became less stable.
The tips, in particular, are the weakest features. This observation
raises the following question: if we model the ice needles as a pyramid
on the top of a hexagonal prism (which correspond to the morphologies
reported in presence of ice-shaping proteins), what will be the maximum
ratio between the basal plane and the pyramid height at the thermodynamic
equilibrium? Thus, which are the equilibrium crystallographic planes
of ice in the presence of such additives? The observations obtained
using the procedure described here could be used to validate or invalidate
the different models proposed for this problem. ZrAc is easier to
obtain and use when compared with AFPs; it can thus be used as a model
system to grow faceted ice crystals, which is difficult to achieve
with other additives.

We hypothesize that, as proved,20 ZrAc
is organized as stacks, whose length is dependent on the concentration.
Such stacks, through an adsorption mechanism similar to that of antifreeze
proteins, hinder the dendritic and cellular growth of ice crystals.
The regular stacks intuitively resemble the repeating motif of several
antifreeze proteins. The adsorption mechanism is mediated by the acetate
anions. To follow where the ZrAc goes while water freezes, one could
exchange one acetate with a small fluorophore, for example, pyrene-based
fluorophores,39 whose size and weight are
comparable with the ones of Zr tetramers (bearing in mind the limitations
previously discussed on the length and weight of the fluorophore).
In this way, we may be able to track the dynamics of ZrAc clusters
in the proximity of the ice crystal and, by measuring the local fluorescence
intensity, we may be able to link the local density with the velocity
of the ice front.41 Similarly, we could
identify how the ZrAc settles on the ice face and whether the mechanisms
are indeed similar to those of AFPs.42,43 Finally, by
using a pH-sensitive fluorophore in solution, we can quantitatively
and thermodynamically follow the freezing process to gain further
insights into how the pH distribution is linked to Zr tetramers and
stacks.

Experimental Methods
Experimental Set-Up
All measurements
were carried out
using a Leica TCS SP8 (Leica-Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) confocal
laser scanning microscope. Confocal laser scanning microscopy has
been primarily developed to image cells, proteins, or other biological
machines tagged with a fluorophore.44 The
technique is also of interest for studies in materials science,45 albeit rarely used so far.

The microscope
is equipped with two external continuous laser sources, at 488 (blue)
and 552 nm (green), driven to the optical section by two independent
optical fibers. The maximum power on the optical plane is 10 mW for
both of them. At these wavelengths, the absorption coefficient for
distilled water is approximately 0.45 × 10–3 cm–1 at 552 nm and approximately 0.25×10–3 cm–1 at 488 nm.46,47 The minimal absorption and the small intensities of both laser beams
imply that no energy is deposited along the optical path through the
sample of few tens of micrometers, as opposed to X-ray tomography
where the intense and collimated beam may locally melt the ice or
change the temperature gradient.24,48 To focus the
laser light at the region of interest, the sample stage is equipped
with 3-axis micrometric drive. Submicrometer resolution for the z-axis (or the vertical direction) is ensured by a galvanometric
stage with a run of 200 μm.

The light-detection section
includes a rotating head that can contain
six objectives: two of the positions are occupied by a Leica HCX PL
APO 40× dry objective and a Leica HCX PL APO CS 20× dry
objective: working distances of each is 670 μm. This short length
hampers the use of any encapsulating box filled with nitrogen to avoid
the condensation of water on top of the glass slide, as described
in ref (37). The collected
light is detected by two photomultiplier detectors that are fed with
photons whose wavelengths can be independently selected. The smallest
optical window is 5 nm, and the two spectra cannot overlap. With this
setup, one can independently capture two fluorophores. The digitalization
of the integrated light is at 8-bits.

For the data collection,
the 20× objective was used to image
the x–y plane and the x–z section for all resolutions.
For example, at a x–y hardware
resolution of 1024 × 1024 px2 (pixels2),
the area sampled is 775 × 775 μm2 at the minimum
optical magnification of M = 0.75× and a frame
rate of 0.388 frames/s for the scanning frequency of 400 Hz, whereas
for the x–z section a hardware
resolution of 1024 × 256 px2 gives a scanned section
of 400 × 100 μm2 at the minimum optical magnification
of M = 1.45× and a frame rate of 0.357 frames/s
at a scanning frequency of 100 Hz. For the measurements in the x–z section, the optical plane is
fixed and the sample is translated along the z-direction
by the galvanometric stage. The microscope is controlled using the
proprietary Leica LAS-AF software.

The sample stage was modified
to accommodate a three-stage Peltier
cooling device (Agilent Technologies), which is water-cooled using
a chiller (Minichiller, Huber) connected from the backside.
The temperature on the sample side is measured by a Pt100 sensor and
controlled by a Lakeshore 336 temperature controller that drives the
current amplifier of the Peltier stage. For this setup, the minimum
temperature is −25 °C. However, we can confidently reach
a temperature of >−21 °C under the working conditions.
Below this value, the temperature cannot be stabilized for times longer
than a few tens of minutes. The temperature measurement in the 0 to
−21 °C range is accurate within 0.02 °C. The maximum
linearly stabilized cooling rate is ±5 °C/min. Faster cooling
rates are possible initially, but the linearity is lost around −15
°C.

Sample Preparation
A solution of zirconium acetate
(in-house preparation of Saint-Gobain) at the initial concentration
of 22.6 g/L (solution #1) of Zr (gravitometrically
measured)17 and the original pH of 2.6
(measured using precalibrated Oregon Scientific pH-meter) was diluted
in deionized water to obtain a solution with equivalent starting Zr
concentrations of 13.3 g/L (pH = 3.2). Two identical batches were
prepared. This concentration was chosen because it is the lowest concentration
at which ice faceting has been observed.18 The pH values of one (#2(NaOH)) of the batches were then adjusted
to pH = 4.0 ± 0.1 by adding 25 mol/L NaOH solution and HCl solution
at 37 wt % (Sigma Aldrich). The latter, #2(TMA-OH), was carefully
diluted with TMA-OH (tetramethylammonium hydroxide, Sigma Aldrich)
at the concentration of 10 wt % in water without overshooting pH ≈
4. The objective was to titrate with two different base solutions
to assess whether the ionic strength of the bases and the inorganic/organic
nature of the bases influence the growth morphologies and/or kinetics.
TMA-OH is a weak base (pKb = 4.2 vs 0.2
for NaOH). The final Zr concentrations for the TMA-OH solutions were
estimated to be 11.2 g/L.

Local gelation of the solutions was
observed while adjusting using the bases: ZrAc eventually gelates
at pH > 4.4. One night of stirring was enough for complete solubilization
of the gelated part. Each solution was stained with 1 mM sulforhodamine
B (Fluotechnik, France), 60 μL/mL. The absorption/emission spectra
of sulforhodamine B are rather insensitive to pH in the range of 3–10,49 and its absorption band is excited by the laser
light at λ = 552 nm (absorption peak at λmax =566 nm and emission peak at λmax = 584 nm in water).b

The fluorescent light is collected in the
575–625 nm range.
To improve the image contrast at the liquid–solid interface,
the reflected light of the blue laser (λ = 488 nm) is integrated
in the 485–490 nm range. Following the method and setup proposed
by Neils and Diller,50 we image the ice–water
interface through the optical axis.

The measured sample is prepared
as follows (Figure 11): a 22 × 22 mm2 microscope
cover slide (borosilicate D263M, VWR, thickness ≈ 170 μm)
is attached onto the copper plate using vacuum grease, which improves
adhesion and thermal conductivity.

Figure 11 Photograph of the sample setup. Half
of the sample slide is on
the cold side of the Peltier cell, and the other half is suspended
in air because the copper plate is elevated above the surrounding
metal plate, so there is no contact on this side. A temperature gradient
parallel to the cover slip as well as perpendicular to its surface
is thus created, and ice crystals grow from the cold side toward the
hot side of the sample.

Half of the sample slide is in contact with the cold side
of the
stage (copper plate), whereas the other half is suspended in air because
the copper plate is elevated above the surrounding metal plate, avoiding
any contact on this side. The ZrAc (12 μL) solution is deposited
onto the middle of the cover slide. Another circular cover slide (15
mm diameter, approximately 170 μm thickness) is deposited on
top and sealed with nail polish. The sample thickness is kept constant
for several hours. The nail polish is porous (after evaporation of
the solvent), and observations showed that within 24 h the solution
eventually evaporated. The thickness of the thin liquid slab is δ
≥ 40 μm as measured using a x–z scan at the resolution of 1024 × 256 px2. The imaging resolution affects the measurement of the thickness
(Figure 12). To measure
the slab thickness more precisely, the optical path should be carefully
calibrated.51 With the current sample preparation
procedure, the thickness of samples made with 12 μL of solution
is approximately 68 μm. Imaging with a squared resolution (same
number of pixels in the x and z directions)
provides thickness measurements close to the expected values.

Figure 12 Variations
in the apparent measured thickness at various imaging
resolutions. To measure the true depth, the optical path should be
carefully calibrated. The two squared resolutions give values close
to the expected ones.

With this setup, we create a longitudinal temperature gradient
through the sample. To limit condensation, the sample and the objective
are surrounded by a transparent protective shield. In general, the
imaging is carried out close enough to the edge of the copper plate.
Condensation cannot, however, be avoided further on the cold side.
We also regularly check for changes in the sample thickness: a sudden
change may mean that the seal cracked during the freezing, in which
case the sample is discarded.

By scanning the x–y plane
(top view), we can measure the longitudinal growth velocity (υl) of the ice crystals on the optical plane, and by scanning
the x–z plane (section view),
we can measure the growth velocity of the edges (υt) and their morphology. However, we cannot yet acquire 3D time-lapse
images at a sufficient rate to perform the measurements in both directions
at the same time. The data acquisition was thus performed in the following
ways: we collected imagesof
the x–y plane
while cooling, to measure υl (freezing direction y).

of the x–z plane
as a function of time during the cooling to measure υt.

at a fixed temperature to obtain a
3D reconstruction
of the crystals.



The gradient of temperature
is thus along the y-direction, the thickness of the
liquid slab is measured along the z-direction, and
the lateral size is measured along the x-direction.

Postprocessing and Image Analysis
The images are post-processed
and analyzed using Fiji.52 The only digital
manipulations done before the analysis were contrast enhancement and
normalization in the automatic mode. A cross section of the frozen
sample #2(NaOH) is shown in two colors (Figure 13): magenta represents the fluorescent signal
from sulforhodamine B diluted in water, whereas cyan is the reflected
signal from different interfaces (top and bottom cover slides and
water/ice interfaces). The dark hexagon-like regions are ice crystals.

cyan reflection from liquid–glass interface. The black hexagon-like
shades are ice crystals.

A qualitative analysis was performed on the time and spatial x–z series, which we can use to
reconstruct the topography of the ice crystals, using Fiji.53 The time series (x–z–t axes) can be used to image the
growth of ice crystal, whereas the spatial series (x–y–z axes) show the
3D topography. Image segmentation was performed using the built-in
tools available in Fiji.

Conclusions
We demonstrate here
how laser scanning confocal microscopy can
be used to investigate in situ the 3D growth of ice crystals, using
a simple setup and a fluorophore. The approach was made using a model
system, an aqueous zirconium acetate (ZrAc) solution, that results
in faceted growth of ice crystals. Upon freezing, in analogy with
ice-shaping proteins, ice crystals of predictable morphologies can
develop in calibrated aqueous solutions. Because, like almost any
solute, the fluorophore (sulforhodamine B) is expelled by the growing
crystals, the ice crystals appear as black bodies immersed in a sea
of fluorescence. We were able to follow qualitatively and quantitatively
the kinetics of the growing crystals using solubilized ZrAc tetramers.
This methodology can also be used to investigate, for example, the
growth in the presence of simple polymers such as PVA, new promising
ampholitic polymers,54,55 either tagged or untagged with
fluorophores, such as it has been proved with ice-shaping proteins.38,56,57 As a minimal amount of energy
is deposited along the optical path in the sample, confocal microscopy
appears much more appropriate than X-ray computed tomography, which
is known to induce artifacts in the growth morphology of ice crystals.24
