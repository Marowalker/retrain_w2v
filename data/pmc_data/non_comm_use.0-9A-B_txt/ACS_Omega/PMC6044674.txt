Bacteria
play a crucial role in skin health. For example, Staphylococcus
aureus and Propionibacterium
acnes cause skin roughness and acne, whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis enhances innate barrier
immunity. Therefore, controlling the bacterial flora is important
in dermatology and cosmetic chemistry. In this study, the bactericidal
activities of different metal salts of lauric acid were evaluated.
The bactericidal behavior of the salts changed according to the type
of metal ion. Specifically, the Mg-, Ca-, and Mn-containing salts
effectively sterilized only S. aureus and P. acnes. Their Co, Ni, and Cu
salts sterilized all bacteria, including S. epidermidis, whereas the Zn salt proved ineffective. The Cu salt displayed the
strongest bactericidal activity. Spin-trapping, detected using electron
spin resonance, showed that this salt catalyzed the generation of
hydroxyl radicals, which can destroy bacterial cell membranes. These
findings demonstrate that metal-ion selection is an important factor
in the design of bactericidal agents for healthcare products.

Introduction
Bacteria, known as
resident microbiota, live on the surface of
human skin and play crucial roles in various skin conditions. The
skin microbiota on healthy skin surfaces contains many forms of bacteria,
such as Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Propionibacteriaceae.1−3 Staphylococcal bacteria, including Staphylococcus
aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, are present in the nasal cavity or in sebaceous glands. In addition,
Propionibacteriaceae, such as Propionibacterium acnes, cause sebaceous conditions and acne-type symptoms. In particular, S. aureus causes inflammation of atopic dry skin
as well as skin roughness and food poisoning.4,5 Conversely, S. epidermidis maintains epidermal health and enhances
innate barrier immunity.6−8 Therefore, many dermatologists
and cosmetic
chemists have focused on the two harmful bacterial florae (S. aureus and P. acnes) and the beneficial bacterial flora (S. epidermidis) for the development of bactericidal agents to control the composition
of the flora.9−12

In addition to acting as cleaning and frothing agents in cosmetics,
fatty acids exhibit bactericidal activity. This activity has been
evaluated against S. aureus, Bacillus Larvae, and Helicobacter
pylori for fatty acids bearing 12–18 carbon
long alkyl chains.13−17 Capric acid and lauric acid display a higher bactericidal activity
than that of other saturated fatty acids.13,18−20 According to Sun et al., lauric acid presents a minimum
bactericidal concentration of 1 mM against H. pylori.20 In addition, it exhibits a stronger
bactericidal activity than that of other saturated fatty acids because
its lipophilicity and water solubility promote its adsorption onto
skin cell membranes.18

Some unsaturated
fatty acids show a stronger bactericidal activity
than that of their saturated analogues.13,14,17,21−28 Greenway et al. found that linoleic acid displays a higher bactericidal
activity than that of stearic acid because of its ability to penetrate
cell membranes.22 Desbois et al. reported
that fatty acid molecules having cis-type double
bonds adsorb easily onto the cell membrane and induce membrane disruption
because of their bent structure.27,28 However, formulators
need to pay attention to the instability of these unsaturated fatty
acids against oxidation when employing them in cosmetic products.
According to Villaverde et al., linoleic acid degrades into ketone-type
compounds through peroxide formation.29

Furthermore, fatty acids have been shown to demonstrate selective
bactericidal activity. Nakatsuji et al. found that lauric acid shows
a stronger bactericidal activity against S. aureus than that against S. epidermidis.9 Moreover, Hsuan et al. reported that oleic acid
preferentially kills S. aureus.30 Powdery divalent metal salts of fatty acids,
or “soap scum”, also display strong bactericidal activity,
which is unexpected because of the low solubility of the salts. In
particular, the calcium (Ca) salt of palmitoleic acid exhibits selective
bactericidal activity against S. aureus and P. acnes.31 However, the relationship between the molecular structure
and bactericidal activity of these divalent metal salts remains unclear.
For example, an investigation into the effect of alkyl chain length
on bactericidal activity revealed that the Ca salt of lauric acid
exhibits a higher activity than that of its palmitic acid analogue.31 Furthermore, the Ca salt of linoleic acid exhibits
a stronger bactericidal activity than that of its stearic acid and
oleic acid equivalents, demonstrating that the degree of unsaturation
also affects the bactericidal activity.32

However, the effect of the counterions of fatty acid metal
salts
on bactericidal activity has not been investigated, whereas the bactericidal
activity of metal ions alone has been extensively investigated. Nies
measured the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of heavy metal
ions against Escherichia coli and found
that cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc ions exhibit MICs of approximately
1.0 mM, whereas the manganese ion exhibits an MIC of approximately
20.0 mM.33 In addition, several bactericidal
mechanisms have been proposed for metal ions. For example, copper,
zinc, and cobalt ions kill bacteria by producing radical oxygen,33−37 binding to cell membranes,38 and inhibiting
enzyme activity, respectively.39

In this study, the effect of metal ions on the bactericidal activity
of divalent metal salts of fatty acids was evaluated. The investigation
focused on the performance of salts of lauric acid, which have been
shown to have strong bactericidal activity toward S.
aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes as well as high stability
against oxygen and light.31 The metal ions
selected included alkali earth metals (magnesium and calcium ions),
transition metals (manganese, cobalt, nickel, and copper ions), and
the representative element (zinc ion). In addition, we compared the
activities of the free fatty acid and its metallic chlorides to show
the bactericidal effects of metal ions.

Results
Preparation,
Morphology, and Crystal Structure of the Divalent
Metal Salts of Lauric Acid
The divalent metal salts of lauric
acid, which were obtained in yields higher than 90%, exhibit fluidity
and hydrophobicity. When 0.01 g of salt was added to 35 g of water
in a 20.3 mm diameter screw-cap tube, powder particles floated on
the water surface and remained suspended for more than a week. The
powder retained its appearance and odor after being stored for more
than 1 month at 25 °C and 50% relative humidity. In addition,
certain powders present different colors. Specifically, Mn, Co, Ni,
and Cu salts appear pastel pink, purple, pistachio green, and powder
blue, respectively. In these transition metal salts, the vibrant colors
result from d–d transitions
or charge transfer between metals and ligands.42,43 All d orbitals are completely occupied in Zn, resulting
in a white salt. In contrast, Mg and Ca salts appear white because
alkaline earth and alkali metal ions do not contain any d electron.

Figure 1 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the obtained
divalent metal salts of lauric acid. The divalent metal salts consisted
of platelike particles, ranging from several micrometers to several
tens of micrometers in size. Corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD)
profiles are shown in Figure 2. For example, the Mg salt presents peaks at 2θ values
of 2.3° (d = 38 Å), 4.7° (d = 19 Å), and 7.0° (d = 13 Å),
whereas its Ca analogue presents peaks at 2θ values of 2.7°
(d = 33 Å), 5.2° (d =
17 Å), and 7.8° (d = 11 Å). These
peaks are attributed to (1 0 0), (2 0 0), (3 0 0), and (4 0 0) diffractions
of the bilayer structures, demonstrating that the salt particles adopt
a lamellar crystalline structure.

Bactericidal Activity of
the Divalent Metal Salts of Lauric
Acid and Metallic Chlorides
In this study, the obtained divalent
metal salts of lauric acid are categorized into four groups according
to their bactericidal activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes. The selective bactericidal activity (SBA)
group includes the salts that selectively kill S. aureus and P. acnes. The time-dependent
bacterial counts recorded upon addition of lauric acid and its Mg,
Ca, and Mn salts to three different bacteria are shown in Figure 3 and Table S1. When lauric acid is added to S. aureus and P. acnes in phosphate buffer, the bacterial counts drop from 5.3 ± 0.3 log
to less than 1 log CFU mL–1 after 3 and 24
h, respectively. In contrast, upon addition of lauric acid to S. epidermidis, the count does not change and remains
at 4.8 ± 0.0 log CFU mL–1 after 24 h.
Similarly, when the Mg salt is added to S. aureus or P. acnes in phosphate buffer,
the bacterial count decreases from 5.6 ± 0.2 log to less
than 1 log CFU mL–1 in 24 h. However, the
Mg salt does not affect the count of S. epidermidis (4.1 ± 0.1 log CFU mL–1) at 24 h.
When the Ca salt is added to S. aureus in phosphate buffer, the bacterial count drops to below 1 log
CFU mL–1 in 24 h. In contrast, the counts of P. acnes and S. epidermidis remain at 0.8 ± 1.4 and 5.1 ± 0.3 log CFU mL–1, respectively, in the presence of the Ca salt. The
addition of the Mn salt to S. aureus and P. acnes in phosphate buffer
reduces the bacterial counts from 5.8 ± 0.2 log to less
than 1 log CFU mL–1 after 1 and 3 h, respectively.
However, it does not impact S. epidermidis, which retains a count of 5.4 ± 0.4 log CFU mL–1 after 24 h. These results indicate the selective bactericidal activity
of the Mg, Ca, and Mn salts.

divalent metal salts.

circle: Ca salt; purple circle: Co salt; blue circle: Cu salt; white
circle: Zn salt.

The non-selective bactericidal
activity (non-SBA) group contains
the salts that gradually sterilize all bacteria. The time-dependent
bacterial counts upon addition of the Co and Ni salts to three different
bacteria are shown in Figure 3 and Table S1. When added to S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes in phosphate buffer,
the Co and Ni salts reduce the bacterial counts from 5.7 ± 0.1 log
to less than 1 log CFU mL–1 after 3, 24,
and 3 h, respectively. Therefore, these salts exhibit bactericidal
activity against all bacteria.

The strongest bactericidal activity
(StBA) group contains only
the Cu salt, which shows the highest activity. The time-dependent
bacterial counts obtained upon addition of the Cu salt to three different
bacteria are shown in Figure 3 and Table S1. In the presence
of the Cu salt, the S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes counts in phosphate buffer decrease from 5.8 ± 0.2 log
to less than 1 log CFU mL–1 after 1, 1, and
3 h, respectively, demonstrating that this salt rapidly sterilizes
all bacteria.

The weaker bactericidal activity (WBA) group contains
only the
Zn salt, which shows the weakest bactericidal activity. The time-dependent
bacterial counts obtained upon addition of the Zn salt to three different
bacteria are shown in Figure 3 and Table S1. In the presence
of the Zn salt in phosphate buffer, the counts S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes only decrease from 6.0 ± 0.1 to 5.0
± 0.2, 5.5 ± 0.1, and 3.1 ± 0.1 log CFU mL–1 after 24 h, respectively. Therefore, all counts remain
above 3.0 log CFU mL–1, indicative of the
weak bactericidal activity of the Zn salt.

The bactericidal
data for the metallic chlorides are shown in Figure S1 and Table S2. The four metallic chlorides
belong to the StBA or WBA group. Copper(II) chloride exhibits the
strongest bactericidal activity, that is, all bacteria are sterilized
by this salt over several hours. Conversely, cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate,
nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate, and zinc chloride exhibit weak bactericidal
activity, that is, the bacterial counts of the three bacteria do not
decrease over 3 h.

Radical Formation in the Presence of Divalent
Metal Salts of
Lauric Acid
The time-dependent electron spin resonance (ESR)
spectra of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO)-OH
upon addition of the Cu salt to a DMPO solution are shown in Figure 4a. The peaks at each
end, that is, MnO(3) and MnO(4), are the third and fourth signals
of the six standard signals for MnO. These MnO peaks exhibit g values of 2.033 and 1.981, respectively. The g values of the four DMPO-OH peaks are 2.020, 2.011, 2.002, and 1.993
in the presence of the divalent metal salts of lauric acid. The time-dependent
relative intensity of DMPO-OH at g2 by
MnO(3) is shown in Figure 4b. In addition, the hyperfine coupling constants present AN and AH values
of 14.9 and 14.9, respectively, which are consistent with DMPO-OH
formation.44 The relative intensities obtained
in the presence of the Cu salt are 1.00 ± 0.33, 1.26 ± 0.13,
1.69 ± 0.16, and 2.18 ± 0.09 at 0, 10, 30, and 60 min, respectively.
In contrast, the relative intensities obtained at 60 min in the presence
of the C12:0 fatty acid and its Mg, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, and Zn salts are
0.23 ± 0.01, 0.32 ± 0.04, 0.22 ± 0.01, 0.48 ±
0.32, 0.22 ± 0.06, 0.28 ± 0.09, and 0.31 ± 0.09, respectively.
These ESR data indicate that hydroxyl radicals form only when the
Cu salt is added to the DMPO solution.

Discussion
Morphology and Crystal Structure of the Divalent
Metal Salts
of Lauric Acid
Here, we discuss the morphology and crystal
structure of the divalent metal salts of lauric acid. All metal salts
present platelike particles with a lamellar crystalline structure.
The XRD profiles are similar to those obtained in previous experimental
studies.31,32,40,45−47 These findings demonstrate that
divalent metal salts of fatty acids, consisting of two straight-chain
fatty acid molecules and a metal ion, form lamellar crystalline structures.

Sometimes, the addition of divalent metal ions induces the formation
of vesicles or bilayer structures.48−50 Liu et al. demonstrated
that the critical micelle concentrations and aggregate morphologies
of anionic sulfonate Gemini surfactants in aqueous solution are changed
by their interaction with divalent metal counterions.50 This aggregation behavior can affect the bactericidal activity.51−53 Here, we evaluated the surface tension of aqueous solutions of divalent
metal salts of lauric acid. As shown in Table S3, the surface tension of all aqueous solutions is 70–73
mN m–1, which is almost similar to that of water,
that is, 72 mN m–1.54 These results suggest that fatty acid molecules do not form aggregation
structures because there are very few dissolved molecules in the water
phase.

Mechanism of Bactericidal Activity of the Divalent Metal Salts
of Lauric Acid
A mechanism of bactericidal activity is proposed
for each newly established bactericidal group. The bactericidal activity
of divalent metal salts of fatty acids strongly depends on the (1)
salt solubility, (2) metal-ion bactericidal activity, and (3) catalytic
activity toward hydroxyl radical formation (Table 1). In the SBA group, the Mg, Ca, and Mn salts
show similar bactericidal behaviors to those of lauric acid. We postulate
that the most important factor for this fatty acid and its three salts
is their solubilities. Lauric acid and its Mg, Ca, and Mn salts exhibit
water solubilities of 0.55, 0.07, 0.019, and 0.017 g L–1, respectively.55−58 However, lauric acid exhibits MIC values of 9.7 × 10–4, 3.9 × 10–3, and 3.9 × 10–3 g L–1 against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes, respectively.9 These MIC values are smaller than the solubilities of the divalent
metal salts, suggesting that the concentration of lauric acid in an
aqueous solution is enough to elicit bactericidal activity.33Figure 5a shows a mechanism for the bactericidal action of the SBA
group. However, the mechanism that governs selectivity remains unclear.
In general, the bactericidal mechanism of fatty acids is determined
by three factors.22,26−28,59 The first factor is fluidization and destabilization
of the cell membrane. The second and third factors are the conversion
of DNA and inhibition of enzyme activity, respectively. The selectivity
may be caused by differences in the composition of the lipids and
proteins in the cell membrane, the DNA sequence, and the tertiary
structure of the enzymes among the three bacteria.

The bactericidal
mechanism of the non-SBA group is shown in Figure 5b. The Co and Ni
salts exhibit water solubilities of 0.011 and 0.022 g L–1, respectively, which exceed the MIC of lauric acid.9,58,60 Moreover, the MIC of the metal
ions is 1.0 mM.33 These data suggest that
the bactericidal activity of the non-SBA-type salts arises from the
fatty acid molecules and metal ions. The Co and Ni salts show a synergetic
effect in their bactericidal activities, caused by both fatty acid
molecules and metal ions; cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate and nickel(II)
chloride hexahydrate are in the WBA group. Therefore, these salts
sterilize S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes indiscriminately.

Here, we discuss the reason for the strongest
bactericidal activity
of the Cu salt. Fatty acid molecules dissolved
in water are not related to the biological activity of the Cu salt
because the Cu salt displays a water solubility of 4.7 × 10–4 g L–1, which is lower than the
MIC values of the lauric acid against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes.58 We postulate
that active oxygen molecules generated by the Cu-salt-catalyzed reaction
are responsible for the strong bactericidal activity (Figure 5c). Nies showed that the generation
of radical oxygen and oxygenation of protein molecules occurred during
the bactericidal process in the presence of Cu ions.33 Thurman et al. and Zhao et al. found that hydrogen peroxide,
hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide are active molecules in this process.61,62 In the first step, the Cu2+ ions are reduced to Cu+ by reaction with water molecules63 1  In the second
and third steps, active oxygen
molecules are generated by the Fenton-like reactions (reactions 2 and 3)64 2   3  The generated hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl
radicals exhibit bactericidal activity by oxygenating the sugars and
proteins present in the cell membrane.36 The bactericidal activity of copper(II) chloride dihydrate is similar
to that of the Cu salt. However, we assume that the bactericidal mechanism
of copper(II) chloride dehydrate is different from that of the Cu
salt because no significant signals caused by active oxygen species
are observed in the ESR profiles. We postulate that solubilized Cu2+ ions in water act against bacteria directly to impart bactericidal
activity.

The bactericidal activity of the WBA group was examined.
Zinc ions
may show bactericidal activity by binding to the membranes of microorganisms.38 However, the Zn salt exhibits a water solubility
that is too low to enable bactericidal activity of its components
(Figure 5d).65 However, zinc chloride is slightly stronger
than the Zn salt. These findings show that the potential bactericidal
performance of this salt is difficult to achieve in the solid state.

Conclusions
The crystal structures and bactericidal activities
of the divalent
metal salts of lauric acid were established. All of the divalent metal
salts were isolated as platelike lamellar crystalline particles measuring
several micrometers to several tens of micrometers. They were classified
into four groups according to their bactericidal behaviors. The SBA
group, which included the Mg, Ca, and Mn salts, showed selective activity
against S. aureus and P. acnes. In this case, the dissolved fatty acid
molecules served as biologically active materials. The non-SBA group
contained the Co and Ni salts, which sterilized all bacteria. Their
biological activities stemmed from dissolved fatty acid molecules
and metal ions. Next, the Cu salt exhibited the strongest bactericidal
activity because it generated hydroxyl radicals. Finally, the Zn salt
was classified into the WBA group because of its low solubility. These
findings suggest that the nature of the metal ion plays an important
role in the design of lipid-derived bactericidal agents. Controlled
selectivity against bacteria is useful because technologies that regulate
bacterial flora are expected to become central in the fields of cosmetics
and healthcare products.

was purchased from Labotech Inc. (Tokyo, Japan).

Metal Salt
Preparation
Several metal salts of lauric
acid were prepared according to a reported method.40 As a representative example, the Mg salt was prepared as
follows: lauric acid (0.01 mol) was mixed with water (100 mL), and
sodium hydroxide (0.01 mol) in water (2 g) and magnesium chloride
hexahydrate (0.0055 mol) in water (5.0 g) were added to the lauric
acid aqueous solution. Then, the turbid solution was filtered to obtain
a white precipitate, which was washed with water and acetone to remove
any unreacted fatty acid and magnesium chloride and then dried under
reduced pressure. In the above process, lauric acid was dissolved
in suitable solvents for each metal salt. When we prepared the Ni
salt, the fatty acid was dissolved in a 50 wt % aqueous acetone solution.
In the case of the others salts (Ca, Mn, Co, Cu, and Zn salts), the
solvent was a 50 wt % aqueous ethanol solution.

If the Cu salt
was assumed to be a nonhydrate comprising two fatty acid molecules
and a copper ion, the elemental analysis results were consistent with
the calculated values. Melting point: >200 °C; elemental analysis:

salts were assumed to be dihydrates comprising two fatty acid molecules
and a metal ion, the elemental analysis results were consistent with
the calculated values. For the Co salt, melting point: >200 °C;
elemental analysis: C, 57.76%; H, 9.88%; Co, 11.07% (calcd for Co(CH3(CH2)10COO)2·2H2O: C, 58.39%; H, 10.23%; O, 19.45%; Co, 11.94%). For the Ni

consisting of two fatty acid molecules and a magnesium ion, the experimental
values from elemental analysis were consistent with the calculated
values. Melting point: 147.7–150.3 °C; elemental analysis:
C, 60.26%; H, 11.15%; Mg, 5.46% (calcd for Mg(CH3(CH2)10COO)2·3H2O: C, 60.42%;

Analysis and Characterization
Individual metal contents
were evaluated using an EDXL300 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Rigaku,
Tokyo, Japan) for the Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn salts. The magnesium
content of the Mg salt was measured with a Z-5010 polarized Zeeman
atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Melting
points were determined using a melting-point apparatus (Bibby Scientific
Ltd., Staffordshire, U.K.). SEM images were obtained using an SU8000
instrument (Hitachi High-Technologies Corp., Tokyo, Japan) at an electron
beam accelerating voltage of 1 kV. XRD analyses were performed using
a MiniFlex X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) operating at
30 kV and 15 mA to generate Cu Kα radiation.

Bactericidal
Activity
The bactericidal activities of
the divalent metal salts of lauric acid were evaluated against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes. The divalent metal
salts dispersed in 2 wt % aqueous ethanol were added to 50 mM phosphate
buffer (10 mL, pH 6) containing the target bacteria. The metal salt
concentration was 100 ppm. Bacterial counts per milliliter in the
initial state amounted to 5.6 ± 0.3 log CFU. These dispersions
were spread onto soybean–casein digest agar plates (with lectin
and polysorbate 80), and the temporal change in the number of bacteria
was monitored for 24 h. P. acnes was
cultivated under anaerobic conditions in an Anaeropack (Mitsubishi
Gas Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan) at an oxygen concentration below
0.1% and a carbon dioxide concentration exceeding 15%. In contrast, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were cultivated under aerated conditions. In addition, the bactericidal
activity of the metallic chlorides was assessed by the above method.
The evaluated samples were cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate, nickel(II)
chloride hexahydrate, copper(II) chloride dihydrate, and zinc chloride.
Three metallic chlorides, that is, magnesium(II) chloride hexahydrate,
calcium(II) chloride dehydrate, and manganese(II) chloride tetrahydrate,
were excluded from the evaluated samples because previous studies
showed that they do not have bactericidal activity against several
bacteria.33,41

ESR
The generation of hydroxyl radicals
was detected
by X-band ESR using an FR-30 spectrometer (ESR; JEOL Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan). The divalent metal salts were added to 50 mM phosphate buffer
(pH 6, 45 μL) containing DMPO (5 μL) and ethanol (0.25
μL). The temporal change in the ESR signal was evaluated for
1 h. The instrument specifications were set as follows: field: 335.300
mT; gain: 250.00; power: 4.000 mW; sweep width: 5.000 mT; modulation
width: 0.1 mT; sweep time: 2.0 min; time constant: 0.03 s; temperature:
25 °C.

Determination of Surface Tension
Solutions of the metal
salts of lauric acid were analyzed with a DM-501 contact angle meter
(Kyowa Interface Science, Tokyo, Japan) at 25 °C and 50% humidity
using the pendant drop method, with a water droplet volume of ca.
0.5 μL. The divalent metal salts dispersed in 2 wt % aqueous
ethanol were added to water (10 mL) and mixed over 3 days. The metal
salt concentration was 0.1 g L–1.
