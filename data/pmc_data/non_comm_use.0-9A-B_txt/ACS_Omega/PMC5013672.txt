Photoluminescence
(PL) of organometal halide perovskite materials
reflects the charge dynamics inside of the material and thus contains
important information for understanding the electro-optical properties
of the material. Interpretation of PL blinking of methylammonium lead
iodide (MAPbI3) nanostructures observed on polycrystalline
samples remains puzzling owing to their intrinsic disordered nature.
Here, we report a novel method for the synthesis of high-quality single-crystal
MAPbI3 nanorods and demonstrate a single-crystal study
on MAPbI3 PL blinking. At low excitation power densities,
two-state blinking was found on individual nanorods with dimensions
of several hundred nanometers. A super-resolution localization study
on the blinking of individual nanorods showed that single crystals
of several hundred nanometers emit and blink as a whole, without showing
changes in the localization center over the crystal. Moreover, both
the blinking ON and OFF times showed power-law distributions, indicating
trapping–detrapping processes. This is further supported by
the PL decay times of the individual nanorods, which were found to
correlate with the ON/OFF states. Furthermore, a strong environmental
dependence of the nanorod PL blinking was revealed by comparing the
measurements in vacuum, nitrogen, and air, implying that traps locate
close to crystal surfaces. We explain our observations by proposing
surface charge traps that are likely related to under-coordinated
lead ions and methylammonium vacancies to result in the PL blinking
observed here.

Introduction
Reporting power-conversion
efficiencies exceeding 20%,1,2 the recent emergence
of organometal halide perovskites (OHPs), methylammonium
lead iodide (MAPbI3) in particular, has enabled new possibilities
for cost-efficient photovoltaic (PV) devices.3,4 OHP
properties such as photoluminescence (PL), charge mobility, trap density,
and their PV performance, however, are found to vary largely depending
on the material preparation and processing methods,5 likely due to differences in the defect density and crystal
morphology. The conventionally employed deposition method for OHP
solar-cell fabrication is by annealing a spin-casted precursor film
at elevated temperatures,6,7 resulting in a polycrystalline
film composed of densely packed crystal grains of a few hundred nanometers
up to micrometers in size. The crystal grains in the film show large
variations in their size and morphology. PL and cathodoluminescence
from such OHP films, reflecting local charge dynamics,8−12 have recently been shown to be highly heterogeneous from grain to
grain.6,13,14 Moreover,
a recent study using simultaneous light and electron microscopy has
revealed significant variations in both PL and morphology evolution
of perovskite crystals upon light- and electron-beam-induced degradation.15 The aforementioned heterogeneity found in submicron-sized
perovskites is closely related to variations in the local ion mobility,13,15−18 trap densities,19 and local chemical
composition,6,13,16,20 which ultimately determine the device performance
on mesoscopic and macroscopic scales.17,18,21−23 Besides OHP crystals themselves,
the inherent grain boundaries in the polycrystalline films are also
found to play an important role in the properties of OHP-based devices.24,25

To best resolve such heterogeneity in the crystal properties
and
the role of grain boundaries, the link between morphology and material
properties needs to be established at the single-crystal level. Applying
super-resolution localization microscopy on individual particles on
a glass cover slide prepared using the conventional film deposition
method, Tian et al. reported on light-activated quenching sites in
single perovskite particles that cause giant PL blinking.7 Super-resolution localization on these blinking
events revealed that the localization center position was jumping
for the sub-diffraction-limit nanocrystals studied.7 Furthermore, the authors reported a strong correlation
between PL intensities and the corresponding localization center positions.7 Whereas these data represent a first-of-its-kind
report on OHP nanocrystal PL blinking, studies correlating optical
localization with morphology at the nanometer scale are still missing,
leaving the mechanism behind the PL blinking phenomenon elusive. In
particular, the sample preparation method employed in the previous
study by Tian et al.7 cannot exclude the
existence of multiple crystal grains within a diffraction-limited
spot. Therefore, single-crystalline OHP nanocrystals, nanorods in
particular, are required to minimize the effects caused by polycrystallinity
in the aforementioned super-resolution optical studies.

Although
a few studies have reported on the solution synthesis
of single-crystal OHP nanostructures,26,27 such as quantum
dots,28 rod- and wire-type crystals,29−32 and platelets,33 controlled synthesis
of OHP rods (100–300 nm) remains challenging. The surface-initiated
solution growth of a single-crystalline OHP gives well-isolated OHP
wires and plates of high quality.29,30 However, this
method requires an initial step that uses a solid surface and results
in crystals of a few microns in size.29,30 A total solution-based
synthesis of OHP nanorods (an average dimension of 800 × 50 nm2) was recently demonstrated by Zhu et al. by employing n-octylammonium cations as capping agents.31 Nevertheless, these nanorods (800 nm in length) are much
longer than the diffraction limit of visible light (200–300
nm). This makes them not ideal for super-resolution localization studies
in which 2D Gaussian is usually used to approximate the point-spread
function (PSF) of single emitters.34,35 Very recently,
Aharon et al. used octylammonium iodide and oleic acid (OA) to control
the OHP nanocrystal morphology and reported on high-yield synthesis
of OHP nanorods of 11 × 2 nm2.32 Such crystals are too small to draw useful conclusions
from the super-resolution localization studies because the resolution
of this imaging modality is only several tens of nanometers34−36 and spatial-related PL phenomena on the sub-10 nm length scale are
out of reach.

In this study, we first present a novel method
to synthesize single-crystalline
MAPbI3 nanorods with an average dimension of 160 ×
35 nm2, using a combination of oleylamine (OAm) and OA
as capping agents. It is noteworthy that the resulting MAPbI3 nanorods are exceptionally stable in toluene suspension even after
8 weeks of storage in the dark. Next, we investigate the PL blinking
of the as-prepared individual MAPbI3 nanorods using correlative
super-resolution localization optical microscopy and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM).15 Finally, we discuss
our experimental observations by proposing under-coordinated lead
ions and methylammonium vacancies to be the surface traps that lead
to PL blinking of MAPbI3 nanorods observed in this study.

Results
and Discussion
MAPbI3 Nanorods
MAPbI3 nanorods
were prepared via a two-step synthesis. The capping agents, OAm and
OA, were first dissolved in toluene. On injecting the precursor acetonitrile
solution into the capping agent toluene solution under vigorous stirring,
tiny MAPbI3 nuclei started to form, resulting in a color
change of the suspension to red. Further crystal growth was achieved
by gradually introducing additional amounts of pure toluene into the
mixture to drive further precipitation of MAPbI3 precursors.
A detailed description of the synthesis method can be found in Experimental Section.

The concentration ratio
between the two capping agents is crucial for the anisotropic growth
of MAPbI3 nanocrystals. On the one hand, when OA was used
as the only capping agent, the MAPbI3 nanocrystals grown
consisted mostly of large bulky clusters of small nanoparticles. On
the other hand, elongated thin wires were found when OAm was used
as the only capping agent. However, MAPbI3 nanocrystals
are found to be stable only in the presence of OA. In the absence
of OA, the nanowires quickly aggregate within several hours of stirring
during synthesis, leading to a clear and transparent suspension. The
anisotropic growth of nanorods is likely due to the complex dynamic
binding of OAm and OA onto certain crystal facets of MAPbI3 during crystal growth, similar to other capping agents used in the
literature.31,37−39 However, the
detailed role of OA and OAm during crystal growth remains elusive
and will be investigated in future.

The synthesis resulted in
a mixture of MAPbI3 nanorods
(∼68%), nanoplatelets (∼22%), and cuboids (∼10%),
as is also visible in the scanning electron micrograph in Figure 1a. The bulk X-ray
diffraction (XRD) pattern, shown in the upper panel of Figure 1b, matches that of the MAPbI3 film prepared by conventional thermal annealing (the lower
panel of Figure 1b),
confirming the crystalline nature of MAPbI3 nanocrystals.
The average dimensions of the nanorods are 160 ± 80 nm in length,
35 ± 20 nm in width, and 32 ± 12 nm in thickness [deduced
from SEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements], well below
the diffraction limit. Although their physical dimensions are broadly
distributed, these nanocrystals show little variation in their PL
emission peak wavelengths (763 ± 2 nm). However, we do notice
that the individual nanorods have a narrower full-width at half-maximum
(FWHM) of ∼40 nm (Figure 2d) in comparison with the PL spectrum of a bulk sample
shown in Figure 1c
inset (∼60 nm).

nanocrystals. (b) XRD patterns of solution-processed perovskite nanocrystals

response function (IRF) is shown in black (FWHM ≈ 0.4 ns).
The red decay curve can be fitted with three exponential decay components

curve can be fitted with three exponential decay components of 65.3
ns (4%), 13.5 ns (31%), and 2.2 ns (65%). The inset shows the emission
spectrum of bulk perovskite nanocrystals (FWHM ≈ 60 nm).

and the corresponding intensity histograms (in percentage) of the
same perovskite nanorod under different excitation power densities,
that is, 1, 10, 40, 160, and 630 mW/cm2.

Remarkably, the individual MAPbI3 nanorods
showed PL
lifetimes that are about 1 order of magnitude longer than those observed
on the polycrystalline MAPbI3 films under identical experimental
conditions (a 100 kHz repetition rate and an excitation power density
of 80 mW/cm2). Figure 1c shows the PL decay histogram of an individual nanorod
(the red curve) and that of a polycrystalline film prepared by the
conventional thermal-annealing method (the cyan curve). Both decay
curves were fitted with a triple-exponential function.40,41 The individual nanorod reveals characteristic decay times of 665.5,
143.4, and 22.2 ns. The polycrystalline film sample that we measured
for comparison showed characteristic decay times of 65.3, 13.5, and
2.2 ns. The longer PL lifetimes observed on the individual nanorods
are inherently related to an improved crystallinity associated with
the reduced defect density and longer charge diffusion lengths.10,13,30,42 Moreover, it is noteworthy that the PL lifetimes of individual nanorods
differ from each other, likely due to variations in defect densities
in each nanocrystal. On average, individual MAPbI3 nanorods
showed characteristic PL decay times of 485 ± 270, 127 ±
79, and 23 ± 13 ns.

PL of Individual MAPbI3 Nanorods
under Ambient Conditions
Figure 2 shows the
PL of an individual nanorod under continuous-wave (CW) laser illumination.
The nanorod in Figure 2a is 150 nm in length and 40 nm in width. The PL intensity image
of the nanorod, given in Figure 2b, closely resembles a 2D Gaussian PSF, with a slight
elongation along the longitudinal axis of the nanorod. The observed
elongation is due to the fact that the nanorod (150 nm in length)
is comparable in size with the diffraction-limited in our experiments
(∼180 nm). Therefore, the nanorod cannot be treated as an ideal
point emitter. Nevertheless, 2D Gaussian is still a reasonable approximation
of the PSF in this case. In particular, the localization fitting will
yield widths that are sensitive to changes in the shape of the PSF
and emission center positions that are sensitive to changes in quenching
or emission sites. Applying a 2D Gaussian fitting on the observed
emission patterns for localizing the center of mass of the emission
over 10 000 frames resulted in a spread of localizations within
a 10 nm radius around the geometrical center of the nanorod (Figure 2c). Even though PL
blinking was observed on the nanorod (Figure 2e–i), the localization position and
widths of Gaussian fittings did not show apparent changes throughout
the entire measurement, regardless of the PL intensity changes during
blinking (Figure S1), suggesting little
changes in the nanorod PSF during PL blinking. Such observations from super-resolution localization microscopy
are in contrast to the report by Tian et al.,7 where super-resolution localization microscopy revealed changes
in the positions of the localization centers alongside PL blinking
in most of the studied nanostructures. The difference in observations
could be related to the presence of multiple crystal grains within
a diffraction-limited area in nanostructures prepared by the conventional
film preparation method in the work of Tian et al.7 This point will be further demonstrated and discussed in
a later section, Super-Resolution Localization
Microscopy on Individual Nanorods and Nanorod Clusters (vide
infra), and is also shown in Figures S1–S3.

Next, we look into the temporal evolutions in the PL intensity
of the same single-crystal nanorod. The nanorod was not exposed to
laser light or electron beam irradiation before optical measurements.
The nanorod PL was first measured under a low laser excitation power
density of 1 mW/cm2, which is approximately one-hundredth
of the typical solar power density at the earth’s surface.
Because of the large absorption coefficient of MAPbI3,
the light penetration depth is constrained so that surface-related
phenomena dominate the experimental observations at this low excitation
power density. PL blinking observed at a very low light excitation
power readily implies that the surface defects or traps play an important
role. The laser excitation power density was then gradually increased
to 10, 40, 160, and 630 mW/cm2. At each excitation power
density, the PL of the nanorod was recorded for a fixed duration of
500 s, with a frame integration time of 50 ms. The corresponding normalized
PL intensity time traces are given in Figure 2e–i, respectively. PL blinking was
observed on this nanorod under all excitation power densities. However,
the PL intensity levels, intensity histograms, blinking frequencies,
and OFF-time durations at these different illumination power densities
vary largely. Under a low excitation power density of 1 mW/cm2, the PL blinking between two steady intensity levels (ON
and OFF) is clearly distinguishable in both the intensity time trace
and the intensity histogram in Figure 2e. It is worth noticing that the nanorod does not become
completely nonemissive in its OFF state. In many cases, the OFF-state
intensity is less than one-fifth of that of the ON state (Figures 2 and S1).

Surprisingly, the often-reported “light
soaking”
or “photo-brightening” that describes a significant
increase in PL intensity upon light illumination7,40,43 was not observed in this experiment on individual
nanorods. The “photo-brightening” phenomenon reported
in the literature is often related to the high density of traps in
perovskites prepared by the conventional method and their passivation
by a yet-unclear photo-induced mechanism.7,43,44 Therefore, the rare observation of “photo-brightening”
on single-crystalline OHP nanocrystals, which was also noticed by
Zhu et al.,31 is most likely a consequence
of inherently lower trap densities in the MAPbI3 nanorods,
which is also evident from the long PL lifetimes (Figure 1c).

Upon increasing the
laser excitation power density, we noticed
significant changes in the ON state of the PL intensity time traces
(Figure 2f–i).
Intermediate PL blinking levels that differ from the previously observed
ON/OFF states started to appear in the intensity histograms (Figure 2f–h). The
fluctuation in the ON-state intensity occurred in a continuous fashion,
which is different than the single-step PL blinking. Moreover, it
started to appear only when elevated excitation powers were applied
but not at the lowest excitation power density of 1 mW/cm2 (Figure 2e). Therefore,
the changes in the ON-state intensity are likely due to the photo-induced
process and of different origin than PL blinking. Photo-degradation,
on the other hand, is unlikely because of the low laser excitation
power densities applied in these experiments; the applied power densities
here are two orders of magnitude lower than those reported to cause
distinct photo-degradation (tens of W/cm2) within the measurement
duration of hundreds of seconds.15,45 Moreover,
photo-induced changes in the ON-state intensity of PL blinking were
mostly observed under ambient conditions, in the presence of air,
but were rarely observed in vacuum. These observations indicate that
the presence of oxygen and water vapor in air plays an important role,
likely related to the photochemical reactions at the perovskite crystal
surface.40,46−49 A detailed discussion on this
point can be found in a later section, where PL blinking under different
environmental conditions is reported (Figure 6).

Super-Resolution Localization Microscopy
on Individual Nanorods
and Nanorod Clusters
Super-resolution localization results
on individual nanorods and clusters of nanorods are compared in Figure 3. Figure 3a shows a PL image of two MAPbI3 nanostructures, whose morphology can be seen in Figure 3d. The two PL emitting
structures are an individual nanorod (420 nm in length and 60 nm in
width) and a nanorod cluster (about 500 nm in dimension). Both nanostructures
showed symmetric PSFs that are larger than the diffraction limit due
to their large dimensions. Applying Gaussian approximation on their
PSFs, localization results are illustrated in Figure 3b,c, respectively. The individual nanorods
showed a single localization position at the center of the nanorod,
even though the nanorod length clearly exceeded the diffraction limit
(∼180 nm). The widths of the Gaussian fitting (∼250
nm) at the ON state were almost constant throughout the entire measurement
(Figure S2), which indicates an almost
static PSF of the ON state during the nanorod PL blinking. The PL
image acquired by averaging several frames during the OFF state (Figure S1c) showed an almost identical PSF as
that of the ON state. Furthermore, localization fitting on the same
nanorod at different PL blinking states yielded overlaid emission
center position (Figure S1). The dim PL
intensities of the OFF events lead to less accurate position determination
and thus broader distributions. Nevertheless, localization positions
at the OFF events spread closely around the localization center position
of the ON state (Figure S1f). These observations
indicated that the entire rod, up to several hundred nanometers in
length, blinks as one whole structure. Generally, it agrees with the
earlier reports.7,50 However, contrary to those studies,
we did not observe clear shifts of the emission localization positions
accompanied by PL intensity fluctuations. At the moment, we speculate
that the observed differences may be related to our different sample
preparation methods.

Figure 3 (a) PL image of two bright spots. The spot on the left
side is
because of the PL emission from an individual perovskite nanorod.
The spot on the right side comes from a random cluster of several
perovskite nanorods. The corresponding scanning electron micrograph
on the same sample area is given in (d). The color bar shows the PL
intensity in the unit of counts per frame (50 ms). The excitation
power density was 16 mW/cm2. (b and c) Plots of super-resolution
localization events over the two bright spots in (a). The color bars
represent the numbers of localization events. (e and f) scanning electron
micrographs of the two nanostructures that correspond to (b) and (c),
respectively. Solid lines in orange and in green colors outline the
two nanostructures, respectively.

In contrast, localization on the cluster of a few nanorods
revealed
an elongated shape in the histogram plot (Figure 3c). Not only were multiple blinking intensity
levels observed for the cluster, the Gaussian fittings also varied
in width over time (Figure S2). This indicates
changes in PSFs that are most likely due to stochastic blinking of
each nanorod within the cluster. Therefore, the elongation in the
localization found in the cluster is thus due to mixed PSFs of the
closely located blinking nanorods.

Power-Law Distributions
of the ON and OFF Times
Figure 4 shows statistics
of the ON and OFF times of blinking events recorded on 14 individual
nanorods. Time traces of each nanorod were recorded for 500 s at each
excitation power density. The PL blinking OFF time and ON time histograms
of the individual MAPbI3 nanorods showed clear power-law
distributions as illustrated in Figure 4a,b. Power-law emission intermittency, which has been
generally observed on single-quantum emitters,51−58 can be expressed by the formula p(tOFF/ON) ∝ tα,
that is, the probability of ON or OFF times p(tOFF/ON) is proportional to the time interval t with an exponent α. As demonstrated in Figure 4a,b, the power-law
exponent (α) of both ON time and OFF time is independent of
the applied laser excitation power density. The ON- and OFF-time distributions
can be well simulated by the power-law exponent α = −1.6
and −1.9, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the power-law
blinking behavior of individual MAPbI3 nanorods is revealed
for the first time. The revealed power-law distributions of the ON
and OFF times are direct evidence for the presence of trapping and
detrapping processes.43,59

Figure 4 (a) Probability distributions of ON times
under different laser
excitation power densities. The red solid line shows a power-law profile
with the power parameter α = −1.6. (b) Probability distributions
of OFF times under different laser excitation power densities. The
red solid line shows a power-law profile with the power parameter
α = −1.9. (c) The OFF-time PL blinking histogram of 14
individual perovskite nanorods resembles the power law. Different
excitation power densities were examined, that is, 1 mW/cm2 (blue triangles), 16 mW/cm2 (green dots), and 160 mW/cm2 (orange squares).

Both the total number of OFF events and duration of OFF times
were
found to decrease when the laser excitation power density was increased,
as can be recognized from the OFF-time histograms in Figure 4a. Although this effect as
such has been reported and suggested to occur because of trap filling,7 a quantitative assessment as presented here has
been missing. Red solid lines, as guide for the eye, highlight the
shift of histograms toward fewer occurrences and shorter OFF times
upon higher excitation power densities. When the power density was
increased from 1 to 160 mW/cm2, the total number of OFF
events reduced by a factor of 2; the average OFF time decreased from
1.16 to 0.76 s; and the longest OFF time reduced from 93.8 to 14 s.
In addition, PL blinking became very rare when increasing the excitation
power density above 2 W/cm2.

Correlation between PL
Decay Time and Intensity of Individual
Nanorods
PL decay times were found to correlate with PL intensity
during PL blinking of individual nanorods, as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a displays an intensity time trace (red)
of an individual nanorod and the corresponding average photon arrival
times (blue), with a bin time of 1 s. Average photon arrival times
were found to shorten when the PL intensity dropped. The ON state
yielded average photon arrival times around 300 ns, whereas the OFF
state yielded them around 283 ns. The scatter plot of the average
photon arrival times within 1 s time bins versus the PL intensity
is shown in Figure 5b. A correlation between the PL intensity and average arrival times
can be clearly observed. The normalized PL decay curves of ON and
OFF states are given in Figure 5c. At the low excitation power density employed here, we did
not find changes in the PL decay times to be correlated with ON/OFF
states as a function of time nor any correlation between OFF-state
decay times and OFF times.

arrival times
measured on an individual OHP nanorod. (b) Correlation scattered plot
of average arrival times versus PL intensities. Dashed cycles are
used to highlight the ON and OFF states. (c) PL decay time histograms
of ON and OFF states.

The shortened average PL decay time found at the OFF states
indicates
the presence of rapid nonradiative pathways. One commonly reported
mechanism is Auger recombination, which is often found in the PL blinking
of semiconductor quantum dots60 and inorganic
perovskite quantum dots.58 The Auger recombination
pathways in the charged states of these systems facilitate rapid nonradiative
decay, resulting in prominently faster decay in the OFF state connected
to PL blinking.58,60,61 However, PL blinking here showed only minor shortening in PL decay
in conjunction with the OFF state (Figure 5c), in contrast to what is expected for Auger
recombination. Nevertheless, it is difficult to exclude the presence
of Auger recombination. It is noteworthy that the OFF states found
during PL blinking were not completely dark, which may indicate that
the traps affect only a part of the nanocrystals. If this is the case,
the Auger recombination can be overwhelmed by the emission that is
not affected by the traps. This point requires further investigation.

On the other hand, PL blinking linked to mechanisms other than
Auger recombination,60,62,63 resulting only in minor changes in PL decay, has also been reported
and attributed to “electron-accepting surface sites”60 or charge carrier traps that are associated
with the surface of quantum dots where coordination of ions is incomplete.61,62 Therefore, the observation of minor changes of PL decay alongside
OHP nanorods PL blinking in this study is likely related to surface
defects or surface charge trap sites, similar to their semiconductor
quantum dot counterparts. If this is the case, it can be expected
that the environment that surrounds the crystal can have an important
impact on the PL blinking behavior.

PL of MAPbI3 Nanorods in Different Atmospheres
PL blinking of nanorods
is strongly dependent on the atmosphere,
namely, vacuum, nitrogen, and air. Typical PL time traces of MAPbI3 nanorods at different conditions are illustrated in Figure 6a–c, respectively, in vacuum (10–6 mbar), in nitrogen atmosphere (1 bar), and in air (1 bar, approximately
30% humidity).

Figure 6 PL blinking time traces and histograms of perovskite nanorods
under
different environments, that is, under vacuum (a), in nitrogen under
the ambient pressure (b), and in air under the ambient pressure (c).
The same excitation power density of 16 mW/cm2 was applied.
The inset shows the scanning electron micrograph of the cluster of
three perovskite nanorods. The red lines are guide for the eye, generated
using vbFRET package.64

We next look into the effect of environment on
the PL intensity
of the same nanorod cluster. A cluster of three nanorods of similar
dimensions can be identified in the scanning electron micrograph (inset
of Figure 6a). The
three nanorods are outlined with dashed lines. The PL intensity of
this nanorod cluster was enhanced by more than 3 times by transferring
it from vacuum (∼600 counts per frame) to ambient conditions
(∼2800 counts per frame), as previously reported.15 Applying state-recognizing analysis,64 four PL intensity levels can be found in Figure 6a,b, representing
the ON/OFF blinking states of the cluster in vacuum and in nitrogen.
The number of levels identified corresponds well with the presence
of three nanorods, each with an independent ON/OFF state. However,
five intensity levels were recognized by applying the same algorithm
on the same cluster in ambient atmosphere. Note that the continuous
intensity fluctuations are significantly larger than the measurement
noise. These intensity fluctuations in the ON-state PL are highlighted
with red arrows in Figure 6c. Such fluctuations in the ON state were found on both individual
nanorods (Figure 2g,h)
and small clusters but only under relatively high laser excitation
power densities in air. Therefore, we propose that the continuous
PL intensity fluctuations of the ON state come from surface reactions
involving oxygen40,46 and/or water molecules.48,49 Moreover, the reactions are likely enhanced by photo-generated charges
and photo-induced ion mobility in the MAPbI3 nanocrystals,13 leading to an apparent excitation power dependence.

PL blinking of the same cluster behaved markedly differently in
the various tested environments (vacuum, nitrogen, and air) without
shifts in the emission spectrum. Blinking was found to be short-lived
and most frequent in nitrogen, whereas blinking of the nanorods in
air and in vacuum is less frequent. Among the three environmental
conditions, vacuum resulted in the longest OFF states. In vacuum,
18 transition events between ON and OFF states among four intensity
levels can be recognized within 120 s (Figure 6a). In air, the cluster showed 27 transition
events in the same time window (Figure 6c). By contrast, 62 transition events were observed
for the same cluster in nitrogen, which is about three times more
frequent than that in vacuum or air. However, the duration of blinking
OFF states in nitrogen was at most several seconds or less, which
is much shorter than that observed in vacuum (tens of seconds on average)
and in air (up to 10 s). The distinctly different PL blinking behaviors
of the same cluster in the three different environmental conditions
lead to apparent differences in the PL intensity histograms in Figure 6. The extreme sensitivity
of PL blinking to the environmental conditions suggests the charge
traps to be located at or close to the crystal surface. Interestingly,
we also found a small fraction of nanorods whose PL blinking was less
sensitive to environmental conditions. This observation implies the
existence of charge traps inside of the nanocrystals as well, but
with a much lower possibility. This observation supports a very recent
report on trap densities on the surface of single OHP crystals that
are two orders of magnitude higher than those in bulk.65 Hence, the traps that induce PL blinking of
single-crystal MAPbI3 are more likely at or close to the
crystal surface.

Discussion on the Possible Nature of Charge
Traps
In
summary, the key findings on PL blinking of perovskite nanorods are
listed as follows.(1) PL “photo-brightening”
under light illumination is rarely observed on the as-synthesized
MAPbI3 nanorods.

(2) ON/OFF PL blinking was observed on
the individual MAPbI3 nanorods under low-power laser excitation.

(3) Large fluctuations in
the PL ON-state
intensity and multiple intensity levels appear at elevated excitation
power densities under ambient conditions without leading to severe
structural damage.

(4) Power-law ON-/OFF-time statistics
suggest trapping and detrapping processes in PL blinking of individual
nanorods.

(5) PL blinking
of most nanorods strongly
depends on their surrounding atmosphere, indicating their sensitivity
to the surface charge traps. A small fraction of the nanorods show
less environmental dependence on their PL blinking, suggesting the
presence of trapping sites inside of the crystals.



Like other ionic materials, under-coordinated ions and
vacancies may be present in single OHP crystals. On the basis of the
formation mechanism, such as light-induced/charge-driven17 or surface reactions,66 under-coordinated ions and vacancies can be located at different
positions, either inside of the crystal or on the crystal surface.
Because of the low activation energies, ionic species including methylammonium
ions, iodine ions, and their vacancies can be mobile in the crystal,
driven by light,17,67−69 and influence
the PL properties.13,15,16

The surface traps that result in PL blinking of the single-crystal
MAPbI3 nanorods are most likely related to under-coordinated
lead ions and ion vacancies. A recent study has revealed spectral
shifts alongside iodine redistribution in MAPbI3,16 which indicates a high density of iodine ions
in the iodine-rich regions and a high density of iodine vacancies
in the iodine-poor regions. The differences in the local iodine contents
are strongly correlated with the local PL emission spectra.16 However, spectral shifts were found to be absent
during MAPbI3 PL blinking in this work. Moreover, photo-induced
iodine migration has very recently been probed using time-of-flight
secondary-ion mass spectrometry and correlated with photo-brightening
without PL blinking.13 Therefore, iodine
ions/vacancies are unlikely to be responsible for PL blinking in the
MAPbI3 nanorods. On the other hand, Yuan et al. recently
reported on instant quenching in MAPbI3 PL by a focused
electron beam.15 Taking into account the
organic nature of methylammonium and its low boiling point, local
removal of methylammonium is a logical consequence of applying a focused
electron beam on the perovskite surface, resulting in high densities
of methylammonium vacancies and under-coordinated lead ions. The instant
drop in PL upon applying a scanning electron beam on MAPbI3 supports this assumption.15

Moreover,
chemical surface passivation of under-coordinated lead
ions has been found to enhance MAPbI3 PL in several recent
studies.6,66 Therefore, besides dedicated passivation
agents, surface reactions of perovskite crystals with oxygen and water
have also been reported to result in passivation of under-coordinated
lead ions by the formation of lead oxide and hydroxide species,66 leading to improved PL. Such passivation by
surface binding involving oxygen and water may be a contributing factor
for the reported “photo-brightening” and enhancement
of MAPbI3 PL in air.40,50

The observed
power-law behavior of the PL blinking ON and OFF times,
in observation (4), suggests trapping and detrapping processes. In
the following, we address each of our key observations one by one
by proposing under-coordinated lead ions and methylammonium vacancies
as possible charge traps responsible for PL blinking in MAPbI3 nanorods. In this study, the excess amounts of methylammonium
iodide during the synthesis and the good crystallinity of the resulting
nanorods are believed to reduce the amount of under-coordinated lead
ions. Under a very low laser excitation, PL blinking reflects the
charge traps formed during crystal growth. Because under-coordinated
lead ions are expected to be rare in the synthesized crystals in this
study, the often-reported phenomenon of “photo-brightening”
by passivation of under-coordinated lead ions with oxygen or water
will be eliminated, as noticed in observation (1). However, PL blinking
can still be observed even at a low density of under-coordinated lead
ions. Because of the exceptional charge diffusion lengths up to several
microns in OHP crystals,10,42 a single charge trap
may control the PL blinking of a nanosized crystal.7,43 Therefore,
PL blinking can take place even at very low charge trap densities
in single-crystalline OHP nanorods, leading to observation (2).

The strong environmental dependence of PL blinking outlined in
observations (3) and (5) can be related to the differences in charge
trap formation probabilities because the detrapping rates in different
atmospheres are different. Furthermore, charge trap formation rates
are different for nanorods in different environmental conditions.
Because of the low boiling points of methylammonium, detachment can
be promoted by a vacuum.70 Moreover, water
vapor in air promotes the removal of methylammonium from a perovskite
surface.49,71 Therefore, both environmental conditions
of vacuum and air can easily result in methylammonium vacancies and
under-coordinated lead ions on the crystal surface, leading to higher
charge trap formation probabilities than in an inert atmosphere. In
contrast, charge trap formation in an inert nitrogen atmosphere relies
only on the thermal detachment of methylammonium from the surface.
Hence, the trap formation probability in nitrogen is expected to be
the lowest among the three environmental conditions. On the other
hand, detrapping rates can differ in different atmospheres. In vacuum
and in nitrogen, detrapping most likely involves mobile ions in the
crystal driven by light. In air, extra detrapping pathways by surface
reactions with oxygen or water may be present. PL blinking of a nanorod
is therefore controlled by trap-formation rates and detrapping rates.

It is noteworthy that the OFF state of PL blinking may not necessarily
correspond to a single trap because of the ability of a single charge
trap to quench the PL of an entire nanocrystal. Therefore, multiple
traps could result in a long-lived OFF state, and this cannot be identified
based on the intensity in this experiment. Assuming the same detrapping
rates for MAPbI3 nanorods in vacuum and in nitrogen, the
very long OFF times observed in vacuum can be understood through the
higher possibility to form multiple traps. By contrast, short-lived
OFF events found on MAPbI3 nanorods in nitrogen, where
the trap formation rate is the lowest, are likely due to single traps,
resulting in similar detrapping time (OFF time). PL blinking of nanorods
in air is, however, more complex as a result of the interplay between
detrapping processes by mobile ions and surface reactions, leading
to broadly distributed OFF times ranging from tens of seconds to hundreds
of milliseconds. However, to verify this point, further investigation
is necessary.

The fluctuations in the ON-state intensity levels
in air under
relatively high excitation power densities found in observation (3)
are most likely due to surface photochemical reactions of MAPbI3 with oxygen and water. Because it occurs only at relatively
high laser excitation power, such surface chemical reactions are likely
promoted by light or light-generated charges.72 This could also contribute to the absence of PL blinking at the
high laser excitation power density above 2 W/cm2. The
promoted surface chemical reactions by strong laser excitation result
in rapid passivation of vacancies and under-coordinated lead ions,
resulting in blocking possible trapping sites.

In summary, the
experimental observations presented in this work
yielded strong evidence for the following: (i) charge traps that cause
PL blinking of MAPbI3 nanorods, likely methylammonium vacancies
and under-coordinated lead ions; (ii) the environmental conditions
surrounding the MAPbI3 nanorods affect the PL blinking
behavior of OHP nanorods by influencing trap formation rates and detrapping
rates on the crystal surface; (iii) a single charge trap on the surface
of an MAPbI3 nanorod can dictate the PL blinking of the
entire crystal; (iv) the OFF state during PL blinking may result from
one or multiple charge traps; (iv) the light-promoted surface chemical
reactions of MAPbI3 with oxygen and water may lead to large
variations in the ON-state PL intensity and may be responsible for
the lack of PL blinking at high excitation power densities.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated a novel approach for the synthesis
of highly crystalline MAPbI3 nanorods and performed a systematic
investigation on the PL blinking of individual MAPbI3 nanorods.
We revealed two-level PL blinking of individual nanorods under low
laser excitation power densities. Moreover, super-resolution localization
study on these blinking nanorods shows single perovskite nanorods
(several hundred nanometers) to blink and to emit as a whole, demonstrating
the ability of charge traps to dominate PL emission in a single nanorod
of several hundred nanometers in length, which is qualitatively in
agreement with the earlier observations.7 Furthermore, PL blinking of nanorods showed strong light illumination
power dependence as well as environmental dependence that are related
to charge trapping and detrapping processes, evident from the power-law
behavior of the experimentally recorded ON/OFF times shown here for
the first time. PL lifetime measurements suggest processes other than
Auger recombination to contribute to the blinking of nanorods. On
the basis of the PL blinking observations on MAPbI3 nanorods
in these experiments, the charge traps that are likely related to
the under-coordinated lead ions and methylammonium vacancies on the
crystal surface are proposed to cause the PL blinking observed here.
Nevertheless, a deeper understanding on the nature of traps and the
detrapping process requires further experimental and theoretical investigations.

Experimental
Section
Materials
All the chemicals were used as received from
Sigma-Aldrich, including lead(II) iodide (99%), hydriodic acid (57
wt % in water), methylamine (33 wt % in absolute ethanol), OA, OAm
(70%, technical grade), acetonitrile, γ-butyrolactone, diethyl
ether, ethanol for spectroscopy, absolute ethanol, and toluene.

Preparation of Methylammonium Iodide (CH3NH3I)
Methylammonium iodide was synthesized by a typical procedure.7 Methylamine (27.8 mL) and hydriodic acid (30
mL) were reacted in a 150 mL round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 2
h under stirring. The precipitate was recovered by using a rotary
evaporator by removing the solvents at 50 °C. The obtained product
was redissolved in 80 mL of ethanol, recrystallized by the addition
of 300 mL of diethyl ether twice, and finally dissolved with absolute
ethanol. Methylammonium iodide was then collected by drying at 60
°C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.

Polycrystalline Perovskite
Crystals
Methylammonium
iodide (92 mg) and 32 mg lead(II) iodide were dissolved in 2 mL of
γ-butyrolactone at 60 °C. A perovskite film sample was
prepared by spin-coating the 60 °C solution onto a glass cover
slide, with a speed of 1500 rpm for 60 s. Right after spin-coating,
the sample was heated at 70 °C for 10 min. The sample was then
subjected to optical experiments right after preparation.

Synthesis of
Perovskite Nanorods
Solution A: 2.8 μL
of OAm and 5.2 μL of OA were dissolved in 5 mL of toluene. Solution
B: 9.2 mg lead iodide and 9.2 mg methylammonium iodide were dissolved
in 10 mL acetonitrile. Magnetic stirring (600 rpm) was applied throughout
the entire synthesis. Solution B (1.3 mL) was injected into Solution
A. The solution turned red in color, indicating the formation of OHP
crystals of very small sizes. After 30 s, 7 mL of toluene was added
to the mixed solution dropwise, after which the solution was kept
under stirring in the dark for 4 h. The dark brownish suspension was
then washed and redispersed in 4 mL toluene two times by centrifuging
at 3000 rpm for 30 min. The final suspension was maintained in the
dark.

XRD
XRD measurements on the prepared perovskite materials
were carried out on a STOE STADI P COMBI instrument equipped with
an imaging plate (IP position sensitive detector) as the detector.
The diffraction was measured using Cu Kα1 radiation
in transmission mode with a focusing Ge(111) monochromator.

AFM
A Smart-1000 AFM (AIST-NT) was used for AFM measurements
under ambient conditions in tapping mode with a Si tip (cantilever
length, 140 μm; resonant frequency, 200–400 kHz; spring
constant, 25–95 N/m) at a scanning rate of 0.5 Hz and a sample
line of 1024.

Integrated Optical and Electron Microscope
(iLEM)
The
iLEM system consists of an FEI Quanta FEG-250 environmental scanning
electron microscope, equipped with a modified door assembly provided
by Delmic BV, the Netherlands. This door features an optically transparent
window which enables the transmission of excitation and emission light
and holds both an EM-CCD camera (Image-EM X2, Hamamatsu) and optomechanics.
Additionally, the original SEM stage is replaced by one that is capable
of holding a high-numerical-aperture oil-immersion objective lens
(Plan Apo VC 100×, NA 1.4, Nikon), which enables high-resolution
imaging in combination with vacuum-compatible immersion oil. The ILEM
instrument is further equipped with a laser illumination system featuring
six distinct continuous-wave laser sources (405, 445, 488, 532, 561,
and 642 nm, LightHub, Omicron). The 532 nm output is employed as the
excitation source in this study. A compact spectrometer (USB4000,
Ocean Optics) is used for spectral measurements. Super-resolution
localization fitting was applied using a set of home-developed Matlab
code. A detailed description can be found in previous reports.73,74 PL time traces shown in Figure 2 were normalized by the initial ON-state intensity
after background subtraction. Half the ON-state intensity was used
as the threshold to determine the ON/OFF times.

Confocal Optical
Microscope for Time-Resolved Measurements
The confocal microscopy
results were obtained on an inverted optical
microscope (Olympus IX71) equipped with a set of galvo scanning mirrors
(Yanus IV, Till Photonics, Chromaphor). A pulsed 485 nm laser (PicoQuant,
LDH-D-C-485) was used as the excitation source. Laser repetition rates
of 100 kHz or 1 MHz were applied. Circular polarization at the sample
was achieved by a set of half-wavelength (λ/2) and quarter-wavelength
(λ/4) waveplates. An oil-immersion objective lens from Olympus which has a numerical aperture of 1.4 and 100×
magnification was used. Time-resolved single-photon counting (TCSPC)
data were acquired with fiber-coupled avalanche photon diodes and
a HydraHarp 400 system (PicoQuant).

Sample Preparation
For SEM characterization, 5 μL
of OHP nanorod suspension was drop-casted onto a 5 mm × 5 mm
silicon chip and was dried in a fume hood. For AFM measurements, 100
μL was dropped onto a clean glass cover slide for about 60 s
and was then dried by a nitrogen flow. For optical measurements, 100
μL of OHP nanorod toluene suspension was dropped onto a clean
glass cover slide and was spin-casted at 1500 rpm for 60 s. For correlative
SEM measurements after optical experiments, the sample was coated
with a thin gold film using a JOEL auto fine film coater.
