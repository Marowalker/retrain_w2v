Considering the ever-increasing
interest in metal-free materials,
some potential chemical applications of quasi-molecular
boron nitride (BN) derivatives were tested. Specifically, the behavior
of BN fragments was analyzed when given defects, producing local electron
density changes, were introduced by using topological engineering
approaches. The inserted structural faults were Schottky-like divacancy
(BN-d) defects, assembled in the fragment frame by the subtraction
of one pair of B and N atoms or Stone–Wales (SW) defects. This
study is aimed at highlighting the role of these important classes
of defects in BN materials hypothesizing their future use in H2-based processes, related to either (i) H2 activation
or (ii) H2 production, from preadsorbed hydrogenated molecular
species on BN sites. Here, it has been observed that BN species, embodying
SW defects, are characterized by endothermic H2 adsorption
and fragmentation phenomena in order to guess their potential use
in processes based on the transformation or production of hydrogen.
On the contrary, in the presence of BN-d defects, and for reasons
strictly related to local structural changes occurring along with
the hydrogen rearrangements on the defective BN fragments, a possible
use can be inferred. Precautions must be however taken to decrease
the material rigidity that could actually decrease the ability of
the BN fragment to flatten. This conversely seems to be a necessary
requirement to have strong exothermic effects, following the rearrangements
of the H2 molecules.

1 Introduction
Hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN) materials have attracted special
interest in the past years thanks to their excellent thermal and chemical
stability. h-BN is the most stable BN species under ambient conditions,
and it is a structural analogue of graphene. These two materials share
the same two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice, but, although the
B and N atomic couple represents the canonical “combo element”1 of the C atom, graphene and h-BN show different
electronic properties, the former being a gapless semimetal2,3 while the latter almost an insulator with a very large band gap.4,5 Also, BN nanotube (BNNT) and C nanotube (CNT) materials exhibit
unalike conduction behavior. BNNTs are indeed not conductive irrespective
of their morphological properties,6,7 whereas CNTs
are conductive and show band gap changes with the change in the nanotube
diameter size.8 Several nanostructured
h-BN compounds with a lattice characterized by the hexagonal symmetry
have been synthesized: nanosheets,9,10 nanocones,11 nanotubes,12 nanohorns,13 and nanorods14 as
well as several nanostructured objects, collectively named nanoflakes.

A vast literature exists on theoretical and experimental studies
of hydrogen adsorption on one-dimensional and 2D nanostructures. It
was shown that both physisorption and chemisorption of H2 are less energetically favorable on pristine h-BNNT and BNNT than
on the carbon counterparts. Furthermore, the presence of topological
point defects induces new local configurations in the h-BN pattern,
which usually implies the onset of new properties.15,16

In this scenario, defects might be relevant for imparting
a certain
affinity toward hydrogen to the BN lattices. It was suggested by Schmidt
et al.17 that the experimental conditions
in the synthetic protocols such as the arc discharge or the high temperature
generally employed and in the chemical reactions at which the single-walled
BNNTs and sheets are grown make point defects—such as vacancies,
antisites, and some very common substitutional impurities, such as
carbon and/or oxygen—highly probable. Different techniques
such as ball milling and plasma etching are also used to introduce
defects into BN-based materials.18,19 In addition
to this, Shevlin and Guo reported that point defects in h-BN sheets can be engineered via chemical etching by ammonia and
HCl gases to create vacancies and other natural defects.20

High-resolution electron microscopy has
directly shown the in situ
creation under electron irradiation of point and extended defective
structures on single-walled BNNTs.21 Interestingly,
molecular dynamics simulations were also employed to gain quantitative
information on the probabilities of creating different types of defects
in h-BN single layers under ion irradiation.16

Stone–Wales (SW) and (B,N) divacancy (BN-d) defect
topologies
are without any doubt among the most common ones in the h-BN-based
materials. SW defects originate by the rotation of 90° of a B–N
bond that causes, starting from four hexagonal rings, the formation
of two pentagonal and two heptagonal rings. BN-d defects are conversely
typical examples of Schottky defect pairs, involving one B and one
N atom. Although in general this pair of charged defects may be spatially
distributed, in practice there is a strong electrostatic interaction
between the two oppositely charged centers, which is maximized for
neighboring sites. It was demonstrated that in the case of the BN
frameworks, once a vacancy is formed, the formation energy for a subsequent
neighboring vacancy is close to zero.21 Thus, the probability of forming a second neighboring vacancy is
higher than at any other site.

In the present investigation,
the affinity toward hydrogen of the
defective small-/medium-sized BN polycyclic aromatic analogue saturated
with hydrogen, collectively identified as quasi-molecular
nanoflake (q-mn) species, was evaluated. In particular,
BN q-mns bearing BN-d or SW defects were studied
as potential hydrogen splitting materials.

The raw idea behind
this study mainly originated from the consideration
of two analogies existing between graphene-like h-BN compounds and
other metal-free materials. In fact, (i) Cortese et al.22 have already shown that N-doped carbonaceous
defective compounds give rise to largely exergonic H2 fragmentation
while (ii), as first reported by Stephan.23 Frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) arrangements, similar to those characterizing
the BN defective materials, are extremely active in H2 fragmentation.
The intriguing overlap of the features above—both connected
to the local electronic-state modifications which are necessary for
the catalytic processes and which are more conventionally obtained
by the use of metal-supported catalysts24−29—would seem to suggest that the defective BN nanoflakes could
be related to H2 cleavage phenomena and hence to transformation
processes involving atomic H, activated by electronic and/or steric
frustration phenomena that arise from the presence of topological
point defects. This possibility would seem to have been experimentally
shown by Nash et al. for defect-laden BN materials, which were actually
able to activate both H2 and olefins with measurable catalytic
rates.30 This finding clearly suggests
that not only the chemical nature of the sites, eventually modified
by the presence of oxide surface species,31 play a role in the catalytic activity of the BN materials, but also
the presence of defects and their local topology can induce catalytic
properties in periodic BN structures. With respect to this, it has
here to be recalled that the use of BN catalytic materials, both as
the metal support32−37 and as the metal-free species,38 is not
new in the literature. In particular, the BN materials were employed
for catalytic reactions that involved either the H2 use39 and its production40 or oxidative dehydrogenation31,41,42 and oxidation43 processes. However, the
systematic exploitation of defective sites in BN materials for practical
aims would represent a rather new approach, whose study could suggest
a great deal of potential future applications. In particular, to take
into account local effects related to possible deformations of the
BN surface produced by transformations following the B and N site
interactions with hydrogen species, molecular BN fragments of different
sizes have been studied rather than periodic systems that, by construction,
could not easily deviate from their starting graphene-like h-BN structure.

2 Computational Details
All the calculations reported
were performed either by a pure quantum
mechanics (QM) or by a hybrid quantum mechanics (QM)/molecular mechanics
(MM) approach, framed in an ONIOM energy extrapolation scheme.44 QM calculations were in any cases set within
the density functional theory (DFT). Differently sized BN polycyclic
molecular systems, saturated with hydrogen atoms, were calculated
by pure QM approaches. Truncated armchair nanotubes, saturated by
hydrogen atoms, were conversely calculated by QM/MM ONIOM approaches.

Gaussian 0945 was the suite of codes
employed in this study. In both the pure QM and the hybrid QM/MM approaches,
the exchange–correlation functional selected was M06-L,46 associated with the correlation-consistent polarized
double zeta basis set, cc-pVDZ, while according to the MM level of
theory, the universal force field47 was
chosen. All the geometries of intermediates and transition states
were, respectively, optimized and characterized as minimum or saddle
points on the potential energy surface with the analysis of the frequencies
calculated within the harmonic approximation. In particular, the transition
states were located by means of the optimized Berny algorithm, as
implemented in Gaussian 09.

The reaction energy (ΔEr) was
calculated as the difference between the energy of products and reactants
of a given molecular event. The activation barrier (ΔEa) was instead intended as the difference between
the energy of a given transition state and that of the species preceding
it. All the energies reported in this study included the zero-point
energy contribution.

The q-mns were built starting
from the h-BN lattice;
as models representing the pristine BN-based nanoflakes, two differently
extended fragments with stoichiometries B21N21H16 and B40N40H22 were
evaluated and specified as BN-I and BN-II, respectively. SW defects
were introduced in the BN q-mns above, obtaining
the models SWBN-I and SWBN-II (see Figure 1a,b). Atom numbering belonging to the defective
configuration is shown in Figure 1c.

SW defects.
N, B, and H atoms are given in the order: blue, pink, and gray.

The models including BN-d defects were obtained
by removing one
adjacent (B,N) couple from the hexagonal framework of the pristine
BN-I and BN-II nanoflakes. The resulting fragments characterized by
the B20N20H16 and B39N39H22 stoichiometries are identified as DVBN-I and
DVBN-II, respectively (see Figure 2a,b).

is represented
in the DVBN-I fragment. N, B, and H atoms are given in the order:
blue, pink, and gray.

The SWBNNT and DVBNNT
fragments bearing SW and BN-d defects, respectively,
were employed to account for the effect of the curvature of the BN
framework (see Figures 3 and 4). Both these fragments were obtained
by a single-walled armchair (12,12) truncated nanotube, saturated
by hydrogen atoms and having a length of 20.9 Å. They were individually
analyzed by an ONIOM QM/MM approach. In both fragments, the ONIOM
model system was the central portion of the nanotube, whereas the
real system was the central portion of the whole nanotube. In particular,
the SWBNNT and DVBNNT model systems were singularly characterized
by a B40N40 and a B39N39 stoichiometry, respectively. Finally, in the SWBNNT model, the position
of the defect was chosen considering that SW defects are less stable
when oriented along the main axis of the nanotube.48

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 H2 Splitting on Pristine BN Nanoflakes
The ΔEr values associated with
the H2 fragmentation processes, occurring in correspondence
of adjacent pairs of B and N atoms (|Bn,Nm|), were calculated for both the BN-I and BN-II fragments.
These processes, irrespective of n and m, showed to be highly endothermic
and almost isoenergetic, resulting in the involved energies of ca.
213 and 216 kJ mol–1 for the smaller and larger
fragments, respectively. This finding is in line with other studies
present in the literature. As an example, Shevlin and Guo20 reported a reaction energy of 1.95 eV for the
hydrogen chemisorption on pristine h-BN. Considering the literature
data and in agreement with our results, it is furthermore remarkable
that the increase of the BN framework size, going from q-mns to “infinite” sheets, has a negligible effect
on the ΔEr values. For the sake
of comparison, it is useful to point out that also on graphene the
hydrogen fragmentation is highly endothermic, as already demonstrated
by McKay et al.49 which evaluated for this
process a reaction heat equal to 1.89 eV.

3.2 H2 Splitting on BN Fragments Bearing
SW Defects
The presence of one SW defect determines
the formation of two heptagonal and two pentagonal rings, in which
several nonadjacent pairs of B and N atoms (Bn|Nm) are present, which are not topologically equivalent (see
double-headed arrows in Figure 1c). The distances as well as the geometrical arrangements
that characterize these different atom pairs could in principle activate
FLP chemistry.50,51 According to this, the introduced
SW defects might influence the H2 splitting processes,
which further could also be influenced by the curvature and size of
the BN fragments that frame the point defect.

In order to validate
these inferences and, in particular, to verify if it is possible to
pick out preferential H2 chemisorption constellations,
H2 splitting ΔEr values
were calculated for the BN models that include SW defects on the eight
different Bn|Nm pairs above. The
hydrogenated SWBN-I model after optimization showed a slight local
pyramidalization/extraction of both the hydrogenated boron or nitrogen
sites, as illustrated by either the dihedral angles θ(Bn) or θ(Nm), reported in Table 1. These dihedral angles
were singularly identified, considering at first the hydrogenated
B or N atom showing the hydrogen atoms in an antiperiplanar configuration
and then the subsequent (and clockwise consecutive) three nonhydrogenated
atoms of the heptagonal cycle (see Figure 5). Table 1, both for the smaller SWBN-I model and for the larger
SWBN-II model, also outlines the distances of the nonadjacent Bn|Nm pairs (dBn|Nm) and the corresponding H2 splitting energy, both reported in the order of increasing dBn|Nm values
(from 3.22 to 3.70 Å).

H atoms are given in the order: blue, pink, and gray.

B and N atom pairs, see Figure 1c.

The structural
features of the different Bn|Nm hydrogenated
pairs are almost invariant, irrespective
of the considered positions, as well as the H2 splitting
energy behavior on the same defective positions is invariant. This
is, of course, a clear indication that preferential SW binding sites
do not exist in this BN fragment. In particular, fragmentation is
in any case highly endothermic, spanning the reaction energy in between
ca. 240 and 260 kJ mol–1. Noticeably, the ΔEr values are regularly higher than the one found
for the pristine BN q-mns.

For the sake of
completeness, three adjacent |Bn,Nm| pairs of the SWBN-I model were analyzed, namely,
|B1,N1|, |B3,N5|, and |B5,N3|. The ΔEr values on these pairs of sites are obtained in the order: 144.7,
122.2, and 139.9 kJ mol–1. Although to a lesser
respect to the nonadjacent Bn|Nm pairs, in this case the H2 splitting energy is invariably
endothermic. The ΔEr values of the
adjacent |Bn,Nm| pairs are also
smaller compared to those of the adjacent pairs of the pristine fragments.
This is in line with the results of Li et al., which demonstrated
that the B–N bonds, adjacent to the B–B and N–N
bonds, are more reactive when the SW defect is framed within a series
of zigzag (n,0) single-walled BNNTs.52

The size effects of the BN model on the H2 splitting
occurring on the SW defects were investigated by adsorbing a couple
of H atoms on the SWBN-II model, which is almost double with respect
to the SWBN-I one. The splitting process was studied considering only
the nonadjacent B1|N3 and B4|N5 pairs. The latter were selected because
in the SWBN-I model, it was not possible to individuate preferential
adsorption sites, while in the same model, the selected pairs of sites
showed the lower and higher ΔEr values,
respectively. Therefore, they could be considered representative of
the whole properties of the SW defect sites of the larger model. Indeed,
significant changes, as shown in Table 1, were not observed either in the structural features
or in the reaction energies.

In order to evaluate the curvature
effects of BN fragments on the
H2 splitting processes occurring on SW defects, the SWBNNT
tubular model was considered. In particular, the H2 molecule
was fragmented on the same nonadjacent Bn|Nm atom pairs already investigated for the SWBN-I model.
The comparison of the results, reported in Tables 1 and 2, shows that
the dBn|Nm values in the SWBNNT model are slightly shorter than those
found for the SWBN-I and SWBN-II models, while the ΔEr values are on the whole smaller.

a For the numbering of the nonadjacent
B and N atom pairs, see Figure 1c.

The curvature
effects were even evaluated on adjacent couples of
B and N atoms of the SWBNNT model. The resultant ΔEr for the |B1,N1|, |B3,N5|, and |B5,N3| were in the order:
246.1, 150.1, and 176.9 kJ mol–1. These are higher
than those found for the SWBN-I model, while the former value is somehow
also out of behavior. Overall, however, the whole image has not changed, irrespective
of the model considered: H2 fragmentation is clearly strongly
endothermic on sites related to the formation of SW defects on BN q-mn materials. Thus, they would seem to be quite different
with respect to the SW carbonaceous defect analogues. These, as found
out by Letardi et al.,53 are actually able
to easily accommodate H atoms, producing exothermic transformations,
hence locally freeing a large amount of energy.

3.3 H2 Splitting on BN Fragments Bearing
Divacancy Defects
3.3.1 Reconstruction of Bonds
In a given
framework, the existence of unsaturated atoms usually implies the
possibility of bond reconstructions. For this reason, once the divacancy
in the q-mns is created, this phenomenon was taken
into account and investigated.

Two types of reconstructions
were considered. In the first construction, DVBN-I{4,10,4}R model of Figure 6a, the nanoflake shows two newly formed B–N bonds, at once
shaping 2 four-terms and 1 ten-terms cycles. In the second construction,
DVBN-I{5,8,5}R model of Figure 6b, 1 B–B and 1 N–N bonds appear
with the concomitant shaping of 2 five-terms and 1 eight-terms cycles.
The {5,8,5}R reconstructed model was found to be more stable
than the {4,10,4}R one of 45.5 kJ mol–1, thus agreeing with the findings already reported by Zobelli et
al.21

Figure 6 Optimized geometry of the reconstructed
DVBN-I{4,10,4}R (a) and DVBN-I{5,8,5}R (b) nanoflakes.
The first underwent
2 B–N bond reconstructions, whereas the second underwent 1
B–B and 1 N–N. Side and face views of the fragments
are reported in the upper and lower parts of the panel, respectively.
N, B, and H atoms are given in the order: blue, pink, and gray.

The formation of homonuclear bonds, as a consequence
of the reconstruction
of defective BN frameworks, was largely debated in the literature.
The first studies suggested that the formation of B–B and N–N
bonds was quite critical. In particular, Saito and Maida suggested
that rings with an even number of sides (e.g., squares, hexagons,
and octagons) preserved the original B–N bonds, while odd-numbered
rings (e.g., pentagons and heptagons) allowed the introduction of
either B–B or N–N bonds.54 More recently, it was conversely demonstrated that the formation
of homonuclear bonds in BN fragments is very common. In fact, as an
example, Sinthika et al. calculated the thermodynamic properties and
vibrational spectra of BN-60 fullerene-like cages, suggesting that
higher number of homonuclear N–N bonds and lower B/N atomic
ratios resulted in more stable configuration structures. Interestingly,
it was also suggested that the presence of homonuclear bonds bestow
the system with salient catalytic properties.55

All the pristine h-BN nanoflakes as well as the ones already
discussed
framing SW defects are planar, whereas the reconstructed q-mns always show strong deviations from planarity. Anyhow, the {4,10,4}
and {5,8,5} reconstructions generate two different kinds of curved
structures. In the first {4,10,4} reconstruction, the resulting nanoflake
has the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid, whereas in the second {5,8,5}
reconstruction, the resulting nanoflake has the shape of a hyperbolic
tangent. This phenomenon is clearly related to the occurrence of cycles
with either four or five terms that in honeycomb structures induce
deviations from the planarity, as already demonstrated by Miller and
Owens..56

The DVBN-II fragment has
a size almost double with respect to that
of the DVBN-I one, but in the case of the larger DVBN-II model, the
presence of BN-d defects generates remarkable structural changes.
However, at variance with the DVBN-I fragment, the DVBN-II one, besides
the minima corresponding to the {4,10,4} and {5,8,5} reconstructions,
was characterized by a minimum on its potential energy surface even
when the bond reconstructions did not occur (see Figure 7). In this case, the fragment
retained its planarity as illustrated by the values of the θ(Bn) and θ(Nm) dihedral angles, reported
in Table 3. These dihedral
angles actually would seem to show just slight misalignments of the
unsaturated atoms constituting the divacancy. The reconstructed DVBN-II{4,10,4}R and DVBN-II{5,8,5}R nanoflakes have features very
similar to those of the analogue DVBN-I ones (see Figure 7b,c). In particular, the B–B
and N–N bond lengths are equal to 1.75 and 1.50 Å, compared
with those reported by Zobelli et al. (1.93 and 1.74 Å) for the
same bonds, in larger planar models.18 Indeed,
this comparison would seem to confirm that the reconstruction is more
effective when the BN framework is smaller and hence more flexible
and prone to geometry changes.18

reconstructions, and the third showed 1 B–B and 1 N–N
bond reconstructions. For the second (b) and third (c) q-mn, side and face views are reported in the upper and lower parts,
respectively. N, B, and H atoms are given in the order: blue, pink,

The DVBN-II{5,8,5}R structure obtained through the reconstruction
of B–B and N–N bonds was found to be the most stable
one, followed by that of the reconstructed DVBN-II{4,10,4}R fragment characterized by the reconstruction of B–N bonds
(actually, less stable of ca. 10 kJ mol–1). The
non-reconstructed DVBN-II species was found to be less stable of over
300 kJ mol–1 with respect to the most stable DVBN-II{5,8,5}R.

Lattice reconstruction phenomena were also mentioned
for the periodic
h-BN lattice and nanotubes having various curvatures.21 In particular, it was demonstrated that in the presence
of BN-d defects, the appearance of homonuclear bonds, that is, of
chemical frustration, is energetically more favorable than the steric
frustration produced by smaller rings that are accompanied by lattice
configurations able to preserve the alternate boron–nitrogen
pattern.57 Thus, the reconstruction—although
influenced, in its effectiveness, by the BN fragment size (see above)—would
seem, in any case, to be a process, which on the whole occurs irrespective
from the size of the considered BN framework.

In order to evaluate
the effect of the curvature on the reconstruction
processes, the DVBNNT model of Figure 4 was investigated. Only the {5,8,5} reconstruction
was taken into account because it resulted in a stable fragment. Indeed,
regardless of the considered geometrical initial guess of the model
system (i.e., either considering the reconstructed DVBN-II{4,10,4}R and DVBN-II{5,8,5}R or the nonreconstructed DVBN-II
fragment) the optimized geometry always converged to the {5,8,5} configuration.
The structural features of the optimized DVBNNT fragment are reported
in Table 4. These features
are similar to those reported for the reconstructed q-mns. Specifically, the formed B–B and N–N bonds, following
the reconstruction, became 1.75 and 1.51 Å, respectively.

3.3.2 H2 Adsorption on Divacancy Defect
Constellations
In this section, the energetics
for the hydrogenation process of topologically nonequivalent Bn|Nm nonadjacent pairs, present in the
{5,8,5} reconstructed divacancy models, is analyzed. The choice of
these models was determined by their relative stability with respect
to that of the {4,10,4} ones. The evaluated molecular event can be
sketched as in the following 1  with X
= I, II, and H/DVBN-X{5,8,5}R, which represents the hydrogenated
species either of the DVBN-I{5,8,5}R or the DVBN-II{5,8,5}R nanoflakes, irrespective
of the defective sites occupied by the hydrogens. According to the
site numbering of Figure 8, the B1|N1, B2|N2, B2|N1, and B1|N2 couples are those that
can be hydrogenated. The B1|N1 and B2|N2 as well as the B1|N2 and
B2|N1 couples are topologically equivalent. Thus, although the B2|N2
system will also be shortly discussed, only one of these pairs for
each topological equivalent case, namely, B1|N1 and B1|N2, will be
further considered. The corresponding hydrogenated fragments will
be labeled as H/DVBN-X{5,8,5}R11 and H/DVBN-X{5,8,5}R12 (with X = I, II), respectively.

Figure 8 Details and numbering
of the DVBN-I{5,8,5}R optimized
fragment. The whole preoptimized geometry is reported in Figure 2.

Because it is well documented that the H2 fragmentation
on both metal-based and metal-free materials might induce changes
in the multiplicity of the system,22,58 the geometries
of the different species were optimized in both singlet and triplet
states.

The singlet H/DVBN-I{5,8,5}R11 species was
found to
be a minimum on the potential energy surface, whereas, irrespective
of the guess made for the geometry optimization, in the triplet state
without exception it converged to the H/DVBN-I{5,8,5}R12 fragment. Conversely, it was not possible to find a minimum on the
potential energy surface for the H/DVBN-I{5,8,5}R12 singlet
state that invariably converged either to the H/DVBN-I{5,8,5}R11 or to its isoenergetic specular isomer, H/DVBN-I{5,8,5}R22, characterized by the B2|N2 nonadjacent pair hydrogen capture.

H/DVBN-II{5,8,5}R11 was found to be a minimum both in
the singlet state and in the triplet state. Anyhow, the difference
in energy between these structures was quite relevant, with a more
stable singlet state of ca. 165 kJ mol–1. Finally,
the H/DVBN-II{5,8,5}R12 species was found to be a minimum
only in the triplet state.

These lines of evidence, on the whole,
suggest that, irrespective
of the BN fragment size and of the defective Bn|Nm site pair topology, the singlet state is consistently
the most stable, with the triplet state being associated only with
high-energy states. Besides this, another aspect deserves our consideration:
the local geometry of the hydrogenated fragments that, irrespective
of the fragment sizes, actually shows an invariant planarity of the
nanoflakes, which is clearly related to the hydrogen adsorption, causing
the breaking of the B–B and N–N bonds.

The geometrical
features characterizing both H/DVBN-I{5,8,5}R11 and H/DVBN-II{5,8,5}R11 in the singlet state
were very similar. Irrespective of the size of BN q-mn, the N1–H and B1–H bonds were 1.05 and 1.34 Å,
respectively, while the dihedral angles θ(Bn) and θ(Nm), defined as before for the SW
defect systems, were in both cases 180°, testifying the planarity
of the BN framework.

These structures were also characterized
by two supplementary bond
arrangements, namely, N2···H–N1 and B2···H–B1.
The dotted bonds formalize auxiliary interactions, while the whole
N and the B groupings, singly, recall what are classically called
hydrogen and banana bonds, respectively. To these ones, regardless
of the considered model, corresponded atomic distances, in the order,
of ca. 1.6 and 1.5 Å, for the N···H and B···H
systems.

The formation of these H bridges between N and B atomic
pairs,
with the closure of two six terms cycles, most likely, contributed
to the stability of the planar arrangements of the hydrogenated nanoflakes. Moreover, the difference between
the B–H and B···H distances (ca. 10%) suggests
a substantial equivalence of these bonds. While the slightly larger
difference observed among the N–H and N···H
bonds could be due to the presence of a slightly more stable configuration
in the fragment, determined by little local symmetry deviations.

Therefore, on the one hand, these results would suggest a substantial
equivalence between the H/DVBN-X{5,8,5}R11 and H/DVBN-X{5,8,5}R12 singlet state fragments and, on the other hand, they could
represent the cause for the impossibility of isolating, at least by
the here employed optimization algorithm, a structure where the H
atom is adsorbed on one N site diagonally facing one B site. This
analysis is supported by studies on H2 splitting occurring
on topologically equivalent N vacancy defects, embedded in graphene-like
fragments,59 that without exception showed
almost isoenergetic H on the different N defects.22

The geometrical features characterizing both
the H/DVBN-I{5,8,5}R11 and H/DVBN-II{5,8,5}R11 triplet state fragments were also found to be very similar to each
other, with the N1–H and B1–H bond distances of 1.05
and 1.20 Å. Conversely, there was a slight difference in the
dihedral θ(Bn) angles, which in the order resulted
in −24.5° and −26.0° for the species-I and
-II. These angle values presumably account for the higher energy of
the triplet state that certainly is also connected to the shorter
B1–H distance (with respect to the singlet case) and to the
fact that the H atom is not shared between the two B atoms.

The energy involved in the hydrogenation, ΔEr, was calculated considering both the DVBN-X{5,8,5}R fragments (with X = I, II) as reactants and the corresponding
H/DVBN-X{5,8,5}R11 hydrogenated fragments as products,
all of them in the singlet state. The ΔEr values were −133.7 and −206.7 kJ mol–1 for the reaction system-I and -II, respectively.

In order
to test the curvature effects on the hydrogenation energetics,
the DVBNNT (12,12) fragment was hydrogenated in correspondence of
both the B1|N1 and the B1|N2 pairs. Therefore, it is here important
to specify that the model system in the ONIOM calculation of the whole
DVBNNT (12,12) species was a reconstructed {5,8,5} fragment, which
was pretty comparable with the DVBN-II{5,8,5}R model.

The hydrogenation of the B1|N1 pair led to minima for both the
singlet and the triplet multiplicity states. As in the case of the
nanoflakes, the singlet was more stable than the triplet state by
an energy difference of −153.9 kJ mol–1.
Incidentally, this difference is very similar to that calculated for
the different multiplicity states, characterizing the H/DVBN-II{5,8,5}R11 species. As already found for the nanoflake models, the
hydrogenated B1|N2 pair, when in the nanotube, is an energy minimum
just for the triplet state species.

The hydrogenation energy,
ΔEr, value calculated for the singlet
state of the DVBNNT (12,12) fragment
was −4.7 kJ mol–1. This smaller value, with
respect to those found for the nanoflakes, is easily a consequence
of the almost fixed cylindrical structure of the nanotube, which inhibits
the formation of both the N2···H–N1 and B2···H–B1
arrangements discussed above.

3.3.3 H2 Splitting and Diffusion on
Divacancy Defects
Taking into account the extreme endothermic
behavior of the hydrogenated SW systems, the hydrogenation process
was further analyzed solely for the BN-d defects, evaluating the H
migration through the sites that characterize the divacancy defect
arrangements. Furthermore, because the blocked curvature own of the
BN nanotube even lessened the stability of the hydrogenated systems, it was
decided to study the hydrogen diffusion, just considering singlet
state species, only on the DVBN-II{5,8,5}R larger fragment,
as shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Energetic profile of the H2 fragmentation and diffusion
on sites related to the BN-d defect formation: ξ, reaction coordinates;
R, reagents; TS1, H2 splitting transition state; F11, hydrogenated
H/DVBN-II{5,8,5}R11 fragment; TS2, (N1 → N2) H diffusion
transition state; F22, hydrogenated H/DVBN-II{5,8,5}R22 fragment.

Because the hydrogenated H/DVBN-II{5,8,5}R11 was the
most stable fragment, it was at first hypothesized that the H2 molecule is split on the B1|N1 nonadjacent pair of the DVBN-II{5,8,5}R model. The activation barrier of this process resulted in
169.1 kJ mol–1. The TS1 transition state geometry
is characterized by a strong elongation in the N1–N2 bond (1.84
Å) paralleled by the formation of the B1–H and N1–H
bonds. Along with these local rearrangements, the nanoflake becomes
planar. Starting from the so-formed H/DVBN-II{5,8,5}R11, one H can diffuse from N1 to N2 with an activation barrier of 8.1
kJ mol–1, while a slight adjustment of the B2···H–B1
arrangement was observed. This transforms the starting fragment to
the specular H/DVBN-II{5,8,5}R22 isomer. The very low activation
barrier suggests a kind of H shuttling between the paired neighboring
N atoms that occur in the divacancy defects and straightforwardly
supports the inference on the equivalence arising between the two
N and the two B pairs, hence on the whole of the equivalence of the
different Bn|Nm pairs present in
the BN-d defect constellations.

In order to verify if the process above is conditioned by
a redistribution
of electronic charge density in the defective sites involved,60 a Mulliken charge partitioning scheme has been
applied to selected BN fragments, including the defective nanoflake
formation and its hydrogenation in the analysis, as summarized in
the following: 2  

Table 5 shows that,
besides one off-trend point [sites N(88)2 of species 1], there are
no consistent changes in the values of the Mulliken charges characterizing
the defective sites of the {585} environment after the reconstruction.
There are actually no basic changes even after the introduction of
hydrogen. Of course, some local modifications can be
observed at the sites directly interacting with hydrogen, but no significant
changes were noticed.

a The generic label,
X(nm)k, indicates that the atom
X, B or N, belongs to
the n-membered ring (n = m) or to the n-membered and m-membered rings (n ≠ m); k shows how many, 1 or 2, of these atoms are present in
the defective environment. By symmetry, there are in fact couples
of topologically equivalent sites, which show almost equal Mulliken
charges. For these couples of sites, the average charge values were
reported.

b Species 3 and
4 are characterized
by hydrogens interacting with B and N sites during the  process. This, of course,
can produce a
certain degree of asymmetry in the properties of these pairs of atoms
that however is, on the whole, never significant.

Finally, to study the effects of
the hydrogen saturation on the
defective q-mn BN environment, an additional H2 molecule was fragmented on the H/DVBN-X{5,8,5}R systems and analyzed in both the singlet and triplet states. The
former showed to be systematically more stable irrespective of the
considered species. In particular, the calculated ΔEr values in the singlet state individually were −278.9
and −277.3 kJ mol–1 for the smaller and larger
fragments. For the further-hydrogenated H/DVBN-II{5,8,5}R model, the ΔEa value was calculated,
which is equal to 29.3 kJ mol–1. These results confirm
the strong stabilization, characterizing the hydrogen adsorption,
and show a more affordable fragmentation of a second H2 molecule once the first molecular adsorption occurs. From these
findings, it is clear that the first H2 desorbing molecule
needs less energy with respect to the second one (ca. 69 kJ mol–1).

Keeping in mind that hydrogen desorption could also take place atomically61 and hypothesizing, for the sake of simplicity,
that a desorption occurs in sequence from the pairs of B and N sites
(or vice versa),a it is observed that the second
H2 molecule is more easily recomposed with respect to the
first one, ca. 71 kJ mol–1, irrespective of the
desorption sequence (the first desorption event from B and then from
N or vice versa). It is also observed that it is always easier to
remove the first H atom from the B site with respect to the N site,
ca. 30 and 93 kJ mol–1, in the desorption of the
first and second hydrogen pairs, respectively. It is finally observed
that the desorption events of pairs of H atoms are on the whole more
difficult than that of the corresponding H2 molecule; considering
cumulative barrier energies, the differential values of the atomic
pairs with respect to the molecular desorption are indeed ca. 375
and 235 kJ mol–1 for the first and second desorption
processes, irrespective of the H atomic desorption sequence. However,
the subsequent recomposition of the H2 molecule (from the
couple of atoms) in the gas phase leads always to an energy gain (ca.
403 kJ mol−1), which straightforwardly bring the
corresponding systems back to the whole energy conditions of the species
involved in the molecular hydrogenation of the H/DVBN−II{585}R and DVBN−II{585}R fragments, respectively.
Taking into consideration these preliminary results, the atomic desorption
followed by the formation of the H2 molecule with respect
to the H2 molecular desorption thus appears energetically
always favored but kinetically generally unsuitable.

4 Conclusions
Defective metal-free BN fragments have
been identified as potential
materials to be employed in processes involving the use or production
of hydrogen. The local defects introduced for originating local electronic
gradients potentially functional for catalytic use were either of
SW or of Schottky (divacancy defect) type. Specifically, the fragmentation
and diffusion of atomic hydrogen near the defective sites were studied.
In order to verify the effects of the size and radius of curvature
inherent in the BN species, the study was conducted on q-mns of different sizes and on nanotube fragments. This choice was
heuristic, showing a considerable reshaping ability of the nanoflake
molecular fragments, depending on the amount and nature of the hydrogen
species interacting with the different defective BN sites, which could
be connected with their specific activity. Given the local electronic
manipulations, fundamental to the purpose of the work, an analysis
was carried out of the spin-state effects on the different models,
actually studied using the DFT approach, also employing ONIOM methods.
The fragments characterized by SW defects show extremely endothermic
processes and therefore do not seem useful candidates for a practical
use. On the contrary, the local electronic changes specifically produced
in the BN q-mns by the presence of divacancy defects
determine an exceptionally exothermic fragmentation of the molecular
hydrogen on them and an almost not activated diffusion of the atomic
hydrogen. This indeed would seem to suggest the potential use of these
divacancy defective BN materials in hydrogen-based reactions. In particular,
evaluating the strong lowering of the energy barrier in the H2 splitting when a second hydrogen molecule is adsorbed on
an already hydrogenated divacancy defective environment, it is possible
to infer that these systems deserve further investigations focused
on their possible applications either as metal-free catalysts, potentially
useful in dehydrogenation processes, or as dehydrogenation reagents,
able to store hydrogen on them.
