Introduction
The five-membered nitrogen
heterocyclic compounds are gaining interest
in organic synthesis because of their presence in a wide range of
biologically active molecules. Pyrrolidines, five-membered saturated
N-heterocycles, are found in a wide variety of natural products1 and pharmaceuticals2 (Figure 1). For example,
(+)-preussin (1) is an antifungal agent and it has growth-inhibitory
and cytotoxic effects on human cancer cells3 and ramipril (2) is an angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure and congestive heart failure.4 Similarly, ABT-418 (3) is a cholinergic
channel activator, which is also used for the treatment of both Alzheimer’s
disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.2a,2b

of pyrrolidine-containing bioactive compounds.

In addition to their importance in medicinal chemistry, enantiomerically
pure pyrrolidines are used as chiral auxiliaries for a number of different
transformations.5 Apart from these, pyrrolidine-based
organocatalysts6 and chiral ligands7 are also employed in a wide range of organic
transformations. Because of their enormous synthetic importance, several
efforts have been made toward the synthesis of pyrrolidine such as
intramolecular hydroamination of alkenes,8 aza-Michael reaction,9 nitro-Mannich/hydroamination
cascade reaction,10 ring transformation
of 2-(haloalkyl)azetidines,11 [4 + 2] cycloaddition
reaction of nitroalkenes,12 [3 + 2] cycloaddition
reaction,13 cyclization of nitrogen-containing
acetals and ketals,14 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone-mediated
amido cyclization reaction,15 palladium-catalyzed
carboamination reactions of γ-aminoalkenes with aryl and vinylhalides,16 palladium-17 and
platinum-catalyzed18 coupling reaction
of N-sulfonated enynes, and gold-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization
of N-tethered alkynes.19 Lewis acids such
as FeCl320 and InCl321 have also been used for cyclization
of N-tethered alkyne-alkenol and C-tethered alkyne-allyl bromide,
respectively. N-Tethered alkyne/alkenes are gaining importance in
organic synthesis because of the formation of nitrogen heterocyclic
compounds in a diastereoselective manner.19−23 Indium(III) salts have long been used in organic
synthesis for different transformations. Indium trichloride has also
been used as a Lewis acid catalyst24 as
well as a stoichiometric reagent25 in various
organic transformations to construct heterocycles, which involves
both C–C and C–X (heteroatom) bond formations. The utility
of indium trichloride as Lewis acids is encouraged by their unique
π-acidity, alkynophilicity, relatively low toxicity, air, moisture
compatibility, and recyclability. Recently, we have developed methodologies
for the synthesis of oxygen and nitrogen heterocyclic compounds via
intramolecular C–C and C–O bond formation from N-tethered
alkyne-epoxides22 and N-tethered alkynes
consisting of alkanol and alkenol.23 We
now present a methodology for the synthesis of pyrrolidine using intramolecular
C–C bond formation from N-tethered alkyne-alkenol mediated
by InCl3 in moderate to good yields with good stereo- and
regioselectivity.

To start with, (Z)-N-(4-hydroxybut-2-en-1-yl)-4-methyl-N-(3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-yl)benzenesulfonamide
(4d) was treated with 1 equiv of BF3·OEt2 (Table 1,
entry 1)
in dichloromethane at room temperature (rt) for 12 h, but the reaction
ended with no result;
however, the starting material was recovered in 96% yield. On the
other hand, treatment with 0.2 equiv of InCl3 (Table 1, entry 2) in dichloromethane
at room temperature yielded compound 5d as the E/Z mixture
with a ratio of 18:82 in 10% overall yield. The structure of compound 5d was determined by 1H and 13C NMR
spectroscopy and comparison with the known compounds.17d Increasing the amount of InCl3 to
1.1 equiv resulted in only 18% yield with the E/Z ratio of 18:82.
The same reaction at 40 °C resulted in 25% yield with the E/Z
ratio of 20:80. The reaction with 0.2 equiv of InCl3 in
1,2-dichloeroethane (DCE) at 80 °C for 12 h gave 5d with a E/Z ratio of 15:85 in 18% overall yield (Table 1, entry 5). Changing the solvent
from DCE to CH3CN, CHCl3, and CCl4 (Table 1, entries
6–9) did not provide any good results. Addition of an external
chloride source, trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) (Table 1, entry 10), did not affect
the yield but reduced the Z-selectivity of the reaction. On the other
hand, treatment with 1.1 equiv of InCl3 at 80 °C in
DCE for 12 h gave 75% of the desired product with the E/Z ratio of
16:84 (Table 1, entry
11). InBr3 (Table 1, entry 12) is less effective under these reaction conditions,
and it produces chlorinated as well as brominated products 5d-Cl and 5d-Br with a ratio of 28:72. The E/Z selectivity
is found to be 42:58 in both the cases (see Supporting Information). This indicates that solvent DCE also participates
in the reaction as per Cook’s method.21 The ratio of E and Z configurations was determined from the crude 1H NMR. In(OTf)3 (Table 1, entries 13–14) was found to be inactive
under the similar reaction conditions. Other Lewis acids such as FeCl3 gave equal amounts of chlorinated 5d and carbonyl
product 6d with 30–40% yields under different
reaction conditions (Table 1, entries 15–16). CeCl3 was also found to
be unsuitable for this reaction. Brønsted acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid and triflic acid are found to be
ineffective as well. Therefore, 1.1 equiv of InCl3 in DCE
at 80 °C stands out to be the optimum condition for the reaction.
The low yield at a lower temperature in CH2Cl2 and DCE might be due to the poor leaving property of the hydroxyl
group. This is in contrast to Cook’s procedure where 20 mol
% InCl3 was used in CH2Cl2 to synthesize
chlorinated cabocycles from allylic bromide in very good yields at
room temperature.21 This indicates that
the allylic hydroxyl group is a poor leaving group and hence requires
a higher temperature compared to that for allylic bromide. It may
be noted that an extremely dry condition is essential for the formation
of single chloroproducts without the formation of carbonyl side product 6d.

Results
and Discussion
With these optimized conditions in hand, we
further examined the
scope of the reaction and limitations with a variety of substrates
(Table 2). The reaction
works well for both alkyl and aryl groups present in the alkyne side
chain delivering cyclized products in good yields. Substrates having
electron-donating (Table 2, entry 5) and moderately electron-withdrawing groups (Table 2, entries 6–8)
on the aromatic ring of the alkyne side chain gave desired products
in good yields. Steric effects play a considerable role in the yield
of the reaction, as reflected in substrates 4i and 4j, which produced low yields compared to those of other substrates.
On the other hand, unsubstituted alkyne (Table 2, entry 1) gave a lower yield as compared
to that of the alkyl-substituted alkynes (Table 2, entries 2–3). This might be due
to the less stability of intermediate carbocation D (where
R = H, Scheme 1) formed
during the reaction. The reaction produced exclusively a pyrrolidine
ring with exocyclic vinyl chloride at 3-position as well as a vinylic
group at 4-position. It is observed from Table 2 that the substrates having a substituted
aromatic moiety attached to the alkyne side chain (Table 2, entries 4–9) provide
better Z-selectivity than that from those having alkyl groups (Table 2, entries 2–3)
in the alkyne side chain. This might be due to the steric hindrance
of the bulky aromatic groups. There is an exception in the case of
substrate 4j. As the reaction becomes sluggish due to
the presence of the bulky 3,5-dimethylphenyl group, there is a chance
of chloride transfer from solvent DCE, which resulted in lower Z-selectivity.
The E and Z configurations of the compounds were determined by the
nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiment of compounds E/Z-5b (Figure 2) and also by comparison of E-configured 5b with the literature data.17d

All of the products were characterized by 1H, 13C, and mass spectrometry.

b The ratio of E/Z isomers is determined

On
the basis of observations, two mechanisms could be predicted
for the reaction (Scheme 1). Stepwise carbocation formation and concerted reaction as
proposed by Cook.21 The Lewis acid activates
the hydroxyl group of allylic alcohol to facilitate the nucleophilic
attack by the alkyne group to generate chairlike transition states A and B of which A is disfavored
because of the 1,3-diaxial interaction between the double bond and
the lone pair over nitrogen of the tosyl amine group.23b More stable intermediate B after
5-endo-trig cyclization forms carbocation D. There are
two possible ways of attacking carbocation D by a chloride
ion. Pathway “b” is less likely due to the steric hindrance
experienced by the incoming chloride ion with the vinyl group and
gives minor E-configured product E-5. On the other hand, attacking carbocation D via path
“a” is more likely as the incoming chloride ion experiences
less such steric hindrance with the axial hydrogen. Therefore, the
reaction via pathway “a” gives major Z-configured product Z-5 (Scheme 1). The possibility of concerted mechanism as proposed
by Cook cannot be ruled out as the reaction with InBr3 in
ClCH2CH2Cl produced both chlorinated and brominated
products 5d-Cl and 5d-Br with a ratio of
28:72 (Table 1, entry
12). As the chlorinated product is less compared with the brominated
product, the rate of reaction via the stepwise reaction is faster
than that via the concerted one. This also explains the requirement
of stoichiometric amount of InCl3 in the present procedure.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a methodology for the synthesis
of vinyl-substituted pyrrolidine with stereo- and regioselectivity
in moderate to good yields. We have also demonstrated that InCl3 can be used as a Lewis acid as well as a chlorinating agent
for the synthesis of chlorinated pyrrolidines. The major advantage
of the method is that it generates a pyrrolidine moiety having two
functional groups, i.e., exocyclic vinyl chloride at 3-position as
well as a vinylic group at 4-position of the pyrrolidine ring. The
drawbacks of the procedure are the requirements of high temperature
and stoichiometric amount of InCl3.

Experimental Section
General
Information
All of the reagents were of reagent
grade (AR grade) and were used as purchased without further purification.
Silica gel (60–120 mesh size) was used for column chromatography.
Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica
gel GF254 (0.25 mm). Melting points were recorded in an
open capillary tube and are uncorrected. Fourier transform-infrared
spectra were recorded as neat liquid or KBr pellets. NMR spectra were
recorded in CDCl3 with tetramethylsilane as the internal
standard for 1H (600, 400 MHz) or 13C (150,
100 MHz) NMR. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per
million, and spin–spin coupling constants (J) are given in hertz. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectra
were recorded using a quad time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Starting
materials 4a–j were synthesized as
per literature procedures.22,23b Compound 6d is known, and its spectral data are in agreement with the literature.19a,19b

Representative Procedure for the Synthesis of 4a–j
Synthesis of (Z)-N-(4-Hydroxybut-2-en-1-yl)-4-methyl-N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)benzenesulfonamide (4a)
Benzenesulfonamide (0.9 g, 3.1 mmol) was reacted with (Z)-4-bromobut-2-en-1-yl acetate (0.6 g, 3.1 mmol) in the
presence of NaH (0.115 g, 4.65 mmol, 55–60% suspension in mineral
oil) under a nitrogen atmosphere in dimethylformamide (25 mL) at 0
°C. After the completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture
was treated with saturated brine solution and the organic layer was
extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 30 mL) and dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4 to get the crude product of (Z)-4-(4-methyl-N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)phenylsulfonamido)but-2-en-1-yl
acetate, which was purified by column chromatography using ethyl acetate
and hexane as eluents (EtOAc/hexane, 6:4) to give the pure compound
in 60% yield. To a stirred solution of (Z)-4-(4-methyl-N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)phenylsulfonamido)but-2-en-1-yl acetate
(0.8 g, 2.0 mmol) in methanol (20 mL) was added K2CO3 (0.417 g, 3.0 mmol) at room temperature. The reaction mixture
was stirred for 4 h. After the completion of the reaction, methanol
was evaporated and washed with saturated brine solution and the organic
layer was extracted using ethyl acetate (2 × 30 mL). The crude
product was purified by column chromatography using ethyl acetate
and hexane as eluents (EtOAc/hexane, 7:3) to give desired alcohol
(Z)-N-(4-hydroxybut-2-en-1-yl)-4-methyl-N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)benzenesulfonamide, 4a, in
50% yield.

Representative Procedure
for the Synthesis of Vinylpyrrolidines
(5a–j)
Synthesis of (Z)-3-(Chloromethylene)-1-tosyl-4-vinylpyrrolidine
(5a)
To a stirred solution of N-tethered alkyne-alkenol 4a (100 mg, 0.28 mmol) in dry 1,2-dichloroethane (4 mL) was
added indium trichloride (68 mg, 0.308 mmol) at 80 °C (N2 atmosphere). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 12 h.
After the completion of the reaction, dichloroethane was evaporated
and washed with brine solution and the organic layer was extracted
with ethyl acetate (2 × 15 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent gave the crude
product, which was purified by column chromatography using ethyl acetate
and hexane (EtOAc/hexane, 2:8) as eluents.
