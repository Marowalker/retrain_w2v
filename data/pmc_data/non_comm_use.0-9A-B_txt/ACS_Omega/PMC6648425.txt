We address the anisotropic oxygen
diffusion in PrBaCo2O5.5 using first-principles
calculations based on the
density functional theory. First, the experimentally observed magnetic
properties such as ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and paramagnetic
phases are examined through systematic consideration of cobalt spin
ordering and oxygen vacancy position. Then, the diffusion mechanism
of an oxygen atom, assumed to be externally supplied, is explored
by evaluating the oxygen migration barriers with the formation of
one-dimensional oxygen-vacancy channel.

1 Introduction
Double perovskite RBaCo2O6-x (R = Y, La–Ho:
rare earth elements, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) has
been investigated because of its various
properties such as complicated magnetic structures, metal–insulator
transition, and fast oxygen diffusion.1−9 Experiments have shown that cobalt 3d spin ordering and oxygen vacancy
formation play a key role in the emergence of the properties, but
understanding of their impact on the properties is still quite limited.
Regarding PrBaCo2O5.5, a neutron and synchrotron
experiment study10 observed cobalt ions
at the center of the oxygen octahedra (CoOct) with the
high spin (HS) state (t2g4eg2, S = 2) and a spin transition to the low spin (LS) state (t2g6eg0, S = 0) at high temperature, while cobalt spin
state inside the oxygen pyramids (CoPy) remains in the
intermediate spin (IS) state (t2g5eg1, S = 1). This leads to an antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition
at 215 K and a ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition at 245 K.
Zhang et al. also found such magnetic phase transitions at 145 and
195 K in PrBaCo2O5.5 and proposed the temperature-induced
spin transition of cobalt from IS to HS.11 Another neutron diffraction study reported the absence of ferromagnetic
ordering and observed an antiferromagnetic-to-ferrimagnetic transition
at 237 K and a ferrimagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition at 255 K.12 This study suggests that the spin states of
CoOct and CoPy are, respectively, the mixed
HS–IS and the mixed IS–LS states below 340 K; those
acquire the IS state at higher temperature.

Above room temperature,
an electronic transition, i.e., metal–insulator
transition, occurs in PrBaCo2O5.5; this has
been more consistently observed compared to above the magnetic transitions.
The metal–insulator transition is found at 330–350 K,
with a structural change from orthorhombic (space group Pmma) to another orthorhombic structure (space group Pmmm).10−13 Furthermore, the vacancy order–disorder transition is measured
at 776 K, leading to the transition from an orthorhombic to a tetragonal
structure (space group P4/mmm),
resulting from the rearrangement of oxygen vacancies.13

Owing to the fast oxygen diffusion, there is great
interest in
PrBaCo2O6-x as promising
cathode or electrolyte for the so-called intermediate-temperature
solid-oxide fuel cells working in the temperature range of 500–700
°C.14−18 Although solid-oxide fuel cells have advantages such as high efficiency,
fast reaction kinetics, fuel flexibility, and low emission of pollutants,
their high operating temperature causes issues of degradation of cell
materials, need for high-temperature-tolerant materials, and delay
in start-up time.19,20 Therefore, huge efforts have
been made recently to develop an intermediate-temperature solid-oxide
fuel cells, and a comprehensive understanding of oxygen diffusion
in the candidate oxide such as PrBaCo2O6–x is of primary importance.

Experiments have
consistently reported that oxygen atoms anisotropically
diffuse through the oxide. An isotope-exchange depth profile study
found anisotropic diffusion in PrBaCo2O5.5 with
an activation energy of 1.02 eV by monitoring the differently oriented
grains.21 The detailed pathway of diffusion
in PrBaCo2O5.357 was described as an interlayer
migration between the Pr–O and Co–O layers using the
neutron diffraction method.22 Oxygen diffusion
has also been investigated by computational approaches, but there
are variations in the calculated results. A classical molecular dynamics
study found anisotropic oxygen diffusion crossing the Pr–O
and Co–O layers,23 and similar result
for oxygen vacancy migration was reported by first-principles calculation
based on density functional theory,24 although
these provide much lower energy barriers for the migration (0.3523 and 0.47 eV24) in
PrBaCo2O5.5. On the contrary, another computational
work employing data-mining technique showed that the dominant diffusion
would be given by the intralayer migration at the Co–O layers,
having the lowest energy barrier in the calculations.25

In the present study, our aim is to figure out the
microscopic
pathway of oxygen diffusion in PrBaCo2O5.5.
We perform the first-principles density functional calculations with
the Hubbard-U correction method. We first look at
how cobalt spin ordering and oxygen vacancy influence the magnetic
and electronic properties of PrBaCo2O5.5, and
the experimental and theoretical observations in literatures are discussed
for comparison. Oxygen diffusion is then investigated in terms of
migration energy barrier based on convincing magnetic and crystal
structures. One thing should be emphasized here is that our calculations
consider one extra oxygen atom to elucidate more practical situation,
which is the oxygen diffusion through the oxide in fuel cell devices.
Previous computational studies have examined how the oxygen vacancy
migrates, instead of oxygen atoms externally injected, by maintaining
the chemical composition of the host oxides.21−25

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
crystal structure of an orthorhombic PrBaCo2O5.5. The structure of PrBaCo2O5.5 is modeled by
doubling the mother material PrBaCo2O6 with
an oxygen vacancy. Along the (001) crystal direction in the oxide,
the Pr–O and the Ba–O atomic layers are alternately
ordered, and the Co–O atomic layers are positioned between
the Pr–O and the Ba–O layers. There are two types of
cobalt ions, CoOct and CoPy, in PrBaCo2O5.5 due to the presence of oxygen vacancy, while only
CoOct exists in PrBaCo2O6.

Figure 1 Unit cell structures
of PrBaCo2O5.5, with
one oxygen vacancy (gray) (a) at the Pr–O layer and (b) at
the Co–O layer. Octahedral and pyramidal environment are formed
by six and five nearest-neighbor oxygen ions (red), respectively.

Prior to examining the oxygen
diffusion in PrBaCo2O5.5, magnetic configurations
and the most likely position of
oxygen vacancies should be investigated, since they determine the
stable magnetic and crystal structures in which oxygen atoms diffuse.
Again, we aim to address the diffusion of oxygen atom that is assumed
to be externally injected. Experiments have shown that oxygen vacancies
are concentrated at the Pr–O layers, and our results also indicate
that oxygen vacancy is most likely to form at the Pr–O layers
(VO@PrO) compared to that at the Co–O
layers (VO@CoO) and at the Ba–O
layers (VO@BaO) when the lattice parameters
of the vacancy containing simulation cells were fully relaxed. For
example, VO@PrO is more stable than VO@CoO by 0.77 eV and VO@BaO by 3.06 eV in the paramagnetic phase. Therefore, the
lattice constant of the structure obtained with VO@PrO is used even for the calculation of VO@CoO and VO@BaO. The calculated
lattice constants for VO@PrO are summarized
for comparison with the experimental values in Table 1.

By taking
into account several arrangements of Co 3d spins and
oxygen vacancies, our calculations indicate that ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic,
and paramagnetic orderings are energetically likely to emerge in the
oxide (Figure 2), and VO@PrO is more likely to form than VO@CoO. The results explain the experimental5,6,10−13 and theoretical literatures23−25 reporting the concentrated oxygen vacancies at the Pr–O layers. VO@PrO is more stable than VO@CoO by 1.05 eV in the ferromagnetic and by 0.71 eV in
the ferrimagnetic phase. Structurally, the local atomic configuration
around VO@PrO is not remarkably changed,
while it shows a strong distortion around VO@CoO. We also find that the ferromagnetic spin ordering dramatically
stabilizes the formation of VO@PrO than
does the paramagnetic ordering. VO@PrO is more stable in the ferromagnetic phase than in the paramagnetic
phase by 0.92 eV. On the other hand, VO@PrO shows similar stability both in the ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic
phases. The energy difference of VO@PrO between the two phases is calculated to be only 0.01 eV. Such a
small difference seems to explain the controversial experimental observation
of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic phases.10−12 Regarding VO@CoO, the vacancy in the ferromagnetic phase
is less stable than that in the ferrimagnetic phase by 0.33 eV, differing
from the VO@PrO case. VO@BaO is quite unlikely to from in the oxide compared
to VO@PrO. VO@BaO is found to be less stable than VO@PrO by 1.84 eV in the ferromagnetic phase, by 1.93 eV in the ferromagnetic
phase, and by 3.10 eV in the paramagnetic phase.

and oxygen vacancy positions. (a, c, e) Oxygen vacancy formed at the
Pr–O layer. (b, d, f) Oxygen vacancy formed at the Co–O
layer.

Moving to electronic property,
the calculated density of states
for VO@PrO in PrBaCo2O5.5 are shown in Figure 3. PrBaCo2O5.5 exhibits a metallic feature
irrespective of the magnetic ordering, and the states at the Fermi
level are characterized by the Co 3d–O 2p hybridization. CoOct and CoPy possess, respectively, 2.60 and 2.21
μB in the paramagnetic-metal phase,
which correspond to the IS states with slightly larger values than
the ideal value (2 μB) for the IS
state. This is consistent with the experimental suggestion by Miao
et al.12 but differs from other suggestions
that explain the metal–insulator transition.10,11 In the ferromagnetic phase, CoOct has 2.63 μB and CoPy does 3.10 μB, and they have the same values in the ferrimagnetic
phase.

at the Pr–O layer. The Fermi level is set as zero.

It is noteworthy that our results do not agree
with the experimental
finding of the electronic properties; in addition, the paramagnetic–insulator
phase could not be reproduced in the calculations. Ferromagnetic and
ferrimagnetic phases are experimentally known to be insulating, and
paramagnetic phase is also insulating below room temperature and becomes
metallic at higher temperature in conjunction with a structural symmetry
change from Pmma to Pmmm. In fact,
one previous density functional study also reported that PrBaCo2O5.5 is metallic.24 Thus,
it cannot be excluded that the discrepancy may arise from the limit
of computational approach in the present work. However, our main aim
is to address the oxygen diffusion in PrBaCo2O5.5, and we believe our computational approach provides a better understanding
of the microscopic mechanism of oxygen diffusion in the oxide. In
practice, the following results in the present work explain well the
experimental observations.

Finally, we attempt to address oxygen
diffusion in terms of migration
barriers. The paramagnetic phase is chosen for the calculations, since
it may correspond to the temperature range of interest for the intermediated
temperature fuel cell application. Our calculations are carried out
based on the following reasoning. To practically simulate the oxygen
diffusion process in the case that PrBaCo2O5.5 is implemented in the fuel cell device, one added oxygen atom is
assumed to be externally supplied as a fuel. When an oxygen atom comes
into the oxide, at the beginning, the oxygen may prefer to occupy
one of the oxygen vacancies or to be positioned near the vacant sites
in the one-dimensional vacancy channel-like structure formed at the
Pr–O layers. In case of the former, the possible path of oxygen
migration to the next position would be six by crystal symmetry, as
illustrated in Figure 4. The migration energy barriers for the six paths thus determine
the most likely diffusion path in terms of energy. It is also expected
that the position of oxygen in the latter case may appear to be the
lowest energy point between the calculated migration path. We exclude
the Ba–O layers in which the formation of oxygen vacancy is
highly unlikely, as we discussed above.

Figure 4 Six migration paths for
oxygen atom. Black solid circle denotes
the oxygen vacancies, and blue arrow indicates the one-dimensional
oxygen vacancy channel along the a-axis. Several
sites of oxygen ion, corresponding to paths 1–6, are pointed
as a number.

As shown in Figure 4, the oxygen ion
site 1–2 represent the oxygen migration along
the channel in the Pr–O layers (path 1). Sites 1–3 and
1–4 correspond to the migration from the Pr–O layer
to the Co–O layer (paths 2 and 3, respectively). Sites 3–4,
3–5, and 4–6 are responsible for the oxygen migration
in the Co–O layers (paths 4–6, respectively). The calculated
energy barriers are summarized in Table 2. The oxygen diffusion path is found to be
highly anisotropic and have a two-dimensional network, possibly moving
in a zigzag manner. Oxygen atom migration along path 2 is energetically
favorable, and the calculated energy barrier is 0.99 eV, which is
close to the experimental values of 1.02 eV obtained using the isotope
exchange depth profile method21 and 1.20
eV extracted using the Arrhenius plot based on the area specific resistance.26 The results lead us to conclude that when an
oxygen atom comes into the oxide, it favors to move across the atomic
layers along the (011) (and symmetrically identical) direction, which
is perpendicular to the one-dimensional oxygen-vacancy channel. This
explains a neutron diffraction study reporting the alternate movement
of oxygen from the Pr–O to Co–O layers or vice versa
in the tetragonal PrBaCo2O5.357.22 Similar anisotropic pathways for vacancy migration
in PrBaCo2O5.5 was suggested with lower-energy
barriers by the previous theoretical studies, although these studies
do not examine an externally injected oxygen atom like in the present
work but the oxygen vacancy. A classical molecular dynamics simulation
reports anisotropic vacancy migration with an energy barrier of 0.35
eV in the temperature range from 650 to 1000 °C.23 An earlier density functional study also suggests that
oxygen migration between the Pr–O and Co–O layers is
favorable in ferromagnetic (and metallic) orthorhombic PrBaCo2O5.5, and the energy barrier for migration is calculated
to be 0.47 eV.24

Table 2 Calculated

Paths 1–6

Intra Co–O layer	4	3 → 4	1.20	
5	3 → 5	1.69	
6	4 → 6	2.72	
However,
another molecular dynamics simulation with data mining
proposes that oxygen migration is constrained to the Co–O layers
in PrBaCo2O5.5 with the barrier of 0.27 eV.25 According to our results, a much higher migration
barrier (1.20 eV) should be overcome for migration to the Co–O
layers, and it seems that the discrepancy comes from the missing quantum
mechanical description of a strong Co–O chemical bonding and
dealing with high temperature up to 1573 K in ref (25).

3 Conclusions
We have carried out first-principle calculations to investigate
the oxygen diffusion in double perovskite PrBaCo2O5.5. Ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and paramagnetic phases,
which were experimentally reported, were found with one oxygen vacancy.
All of the magnetic phases were electronically metallic, and the state
of the Fermi level exhibits the mixed oxygen 2p and cobalt 3d characterization.
Surprisingly, cobalt ions in both octahedral and pyramidal sites possess
an intermediate spin state in the paramagnetic phase, differing from
the typical interpretation of the metal–insulator transition
in PrBaCo2O6–x. Oxygen
diffusion path was examined on the basis of the obtained magnetic
and vacant structures. The paramagnetic orthorhombic phase was taken
into account for the diffusion calculations, since it is responsible
for the situation in the temperature range of interest for intermediate
temperature solid-oxide fuel cell applications. We conclude that the
main contribution of oxygen diffusivity is attributed to the migration
from the Pr–O layer to the Co–O layer or vice versa
along the direction perpendicular to the one-dimensional oxygen-vacancy
channel.

4 Computational Details
Our calculations
were performed using the project-augmented wave
method27 and the generalized gradient approximation
in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof scheme,28 with the Hubbard-U correction as implemented
in the Vienna ab initio simulation package code.29 A rotationally invariant +U method was
applied for the Co 3d states. In general, the U-values
are taken from the literature or are selected in a specific way such
as to calibrate the values, which reproduce the experimentally measured
magnetic moments in the given system.30 Here, we considered the former and the effective U-value (Ueff) of 5.0 eV, which provides
reliable results in the related materials.31,32 The electronic wave functions were expanded in a plane wave basis
set with an energy cutoff of 400 eV. The calculations were performed
using PrBaCo2O5.5 unit cells containing 19 atoms
with one oxygen vacancy. The integrations over the Brillouin zone
were carried out using an 8 × 8 × 4 k-point
grid. All of the lattice parameters and atomic coordinates were fully
optimized until the Hellmann–Feynman forces were less than
0.02 eV/Å. For simulating oxygen ion diffusion, 2 × 2 ×
1 supercells containing 40 atoms and a 4 × 4 × 4 k-point grid were used.

We specified initial magnetic
moments for each Co atom considering
the crystal field effect at the Co sites (octahedral and pyramidal
symmetry). In the calculations, the Pr 4f orbitals were treated as
the core states (valence electron configuration: 5s25p65d16s2) in the Pr pseudopotential, since
Pr is not attributed to the experimentally observed magnetization
above the temperature of 20 K,10,12,33 and the treatment of Pr 4f as the valence states in the pseudopotential
is known to have nonphysical computational consequences.34,35
