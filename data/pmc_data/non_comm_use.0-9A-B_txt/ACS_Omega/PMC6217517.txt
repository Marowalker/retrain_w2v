The
study of protein conformations using molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations has been in place for decades. A major contribution to
the structural stability and native conformation of a protein is made
by the primary sequence and disulfide bonds formed during the folding
process. Here, we investigated μ-conotoxins GIIIA, KIIIA, PIIIA,
SIIIA, and SmIIIA as model peptides possessing three disulfide bonds.
Their NMR structures were used for MD simulations in a novel approach
studying the conformations between the folded and the unfolded states
by systematically breaking the distinct disulfide bonds and monitoring
the conformational stability of the peptides. As an outcome, the use
of a combination of the existing knowledge and results from the simulations
to classify the studied peptides within the extreme models of disulfide
folding pathways, namely the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor pathway
and the hirudin pathway, is demonstrated. Recommendations for the
design and synthesis of cysteine-rich peptides with a reduced number
of disulfide bonds conclude the study.

Introduction
Conotoxins are neuropeptides
from the venom of marine cone snails,
which interact with a wide range of biological targets (e.g., ion
channels, transmembrane receptors, and transporters) and hence are
of pharmaceutical interest and of great potential as molecular probes
to study the specific subtypes of ion channels and receptors.1,2 Conotoxins consist of approximately 10–50 amino acid residues
and are classified according to their cysteine patterns.3,4 The typical CC–C–C–CC pattern defines the framework
for conotoxins of the M-superfamily comprised by ψ-, μ-,
and κM-conotoxins.3,5,6 The family of the 27 currently known μ-conotoxins4,7 selectively binds to the ion channel pore of the voltage-gated sodium
channels, thus blocking the influx of sodium ions into the cell. Therefore,
these peptides also gained interest as useful tools for research studies
in electrophysiology.100−9 μ-Conotoxins are cysteine-rich peptides
consisting of 6 cysteines which can give rise to 15 conformational
isomers of different disulfide connectivities in various combinations
of disulfide bonds.9 However, the dominant
isomer among them bears the disulfide linkage of C1–C4, C2–C5,
and C3–C8, often referred to as the “native fold”.9 The molecular principles underlying the folding
bias contributing to one particular dominant isomer is as yet unclear.
This subject is of great importance because an accumulation of cysteines
may also occur in distinct regions of larger peptides and proteins
such as that observed in defensins,10,11 resistins,12 Kunitz serine protease inhibitors,13 and various growth factors.12,14,15 In such cases, any information on their
preferred disulfide connectivity would be relevant especially in the
absence of actual chemical or structural data.

Conotoxins represent
a promising tool for studying the impact of
disulfide bonds on the folding process owing to their small to medium
size which makes them intermediates between peptides and proteins
and also their high disulfide bond content.3,5,16 We studied the μ-conotoxins GIIIA,
KIIIA, PIIIA, SIIIA, and SmIIIA (Figure 1) using unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations performed on their NMR structures. The simulation
output was correlated with the in vitro data from the oxidation reaction
for all the μ-conotoxins that had been described earlier.100−9 The individual μ-conotoxins could be grouped based on the
reaction product yield and the side product formation,17 which allowed for a functional comparison with
the computational study. For the MD studies, a rather unconventional
approach was pursued by analyzing the process of refolding; that is,
the behavior and stability of an individual peptide was observed upon
successive opening of disulfide bonds in the folded peptide NMR structures.
The analyses conducted on the resulting MD trajectories gave rise
to inferences on characteristic factors contributing to the conformational
stability of the folded conopeptides. On the other hand, we used the
distances sampled by the sulfur atoms between the reduced cysteine
residues to observe and determine if the peptide with a disulfide
bond removed in silico tries to refold or not. This enabled drawing
a distinction between the influence of the disulfide bond and the
properties exerted by the rest of the sequence to the maintenance
of close-to-native backbone conformations in peptides with computationally
reduced disulfide bonds. This consequently simulates the state at
which the peptide is at its final stage of folding and in its near-native
conformation.

The pathways for disulfide folding have been classified into
two
extreme models despite exhibiting a high degree of diversity.18 One model is represented by the bovine pancreatic
trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)-like folding, where there is a predominance
of native intermediates at various steps down the folding funnel,
and the other extreme, the hirudin pathway, is defined by highly heterogeneous
non-native intermediates. Interestingly, conotoxins are so far placed
in between these two extreme models in a hybrid BPTI–hirudin
model.18 In the present study, we thus
try to improve the clarity regarding the classification of the peptides
used herein considering the existing models. Finally, an attempt to
relate the simulation inferences from these peptides with open disulfide
bonds to their propensity (or) favorability to retain close-to-native
conformations is presented via a qualitative grouping.

Results and Discussion
Studies of conotoxin folding include, in general, experimental
approaches such as regioselective oxidation strategies, spontaneous
oxidative self-folding, and optimization of the folding methods tested,
recombinant expression, and so far available information from the
biosynthesis of conotoxins in the venom duct of cone snails. However,
it is still unresolved how exactly the cone snails produce properly
folded peptide and protein toxins. In order to approach the mechanisms
behind conotoxin folding, several studies focused on using computational
strategies to provide valuable insights into the structural features
important for the folding process, but often a combination of both
experimental and theoretical work is missing or only one conotoxin
was in the focus of most of these studies.

Oxidative Self-Folding
of μ-Conotoxins
In order
to provide the in-house experimental data for comparison with the
computational results, equal amounts of each of the selected five
μ-conotoxins (Figure 1, Table 1)
were used for the oxidation reaction according to a protocol earlier
described yielding an undirected and spontaneous formation of disulfide
bonds.100−9 Under the conditions applied, oxidation of μ-SmIIIA
and μ-PIIIA resulted in several peaks of fully oxidized product(s)
as confirmed by mass spectrometry; that is, the disulfide connectivity
of the individual fractions is different from the native (major) fold.9 In contrast, oxidation of all other peptides,
that is, μ-GIIIA, μ-KIIIA, and μ-SIIIA, resulted
in one major product confirming earlier reports (Figure 2).17,22,23

a Residues are highlighted according
to their character: basic (blue), acidic (red), polar uncharged (green),
and cysteine (yellow) (Z: pyroglutamate, O: 4-hydroxyproline). *All
peptides were used as amides. Native μ-SmIIIA occurs as the
C-terminal acid, however, is usually used as an amide.100,8 We used μ-SmIIIA as an amide for reasons of comparison because
both structures were found to be identical.30#In general, the IC50 values determined for
the toxins ion channel blocking activity at the skeletal muscle NaV1.4 expressed in Xenopus oocytes
are given, with the exception of SmIIIA where only KD is available.

The formation of one major product for μ-GIIIA and μ-SIIIA
can be explained by a rapid collapse into the favored native fold
with the disulfide connectivity C1–C4/C2–C5/C3–C6
as introduced earlier.17 For μ-KIIIA,
such a rapid collapse also results in one main product; however, the
connectivity C1–C5/C2–C4/C3–C6 is preferred here,
and the pattern C1–C4/C2–C5/C3–C6 is only present
as a minor fraction. Small differences in the elution profiles of
buffer-oxidized μ-KIIIA (the crude product), that is, product
formation, might result from the differences in batch size and composition
of the oxidation buffer compared to the results of Khoo et al.25 In the case of μ-PIIIA and μ-SmIIIA,
a different folding mechanism indicative of a slower rearrangement
results in the formation of several isomers. This can be attributed
to more diverse noncovalent interactions and electrostatic forces
compared to μ-GIIIA and μ-SIIIA. Here, it was suggested
that the native isomer accumulates via reshuffling of disulfide bonds
during the folding process and is dependent on the thermodynamic stability
of the isomer formed.17,31 Although μ-SIIIA and μ-SmIIIA
have a high sequence similarity (Table 1), the higher number of basic residues in μ-SmIIIA
(six Arg) might cause the formation of multiple isomers, whereas in
case of μ-SIIIA (two Arg and one Lys), only one isomer is preferred.17,32 μ-PIIIA forms multiple isomers possibly for the same reason.9 In contrast, the structure of μ-GIIIA tolerates
a high number of basic residues and forms only one major product compared
to that of μ-PIIIA and μ-SmIIIA.17 Several aspects influencing the folding, such as the number of hydroxyproline
residues, the loop size between the two linked cysteines, or amidation
of the C-terminus, are discussed controversially in the literature
without a clear preference indicating the uniqueness of each sequence
and the respective biological activity.17,28,33,34

Conformational Analysis
Using Molecular Dynamics
The
solution NMR structures used herein as initial conformations for starting
MD simulations were derived from the ConoServer database (Figure 1, Table 1).4,7 Comparison,
alignment, and structural differences of the μ-conotoxin structures
were discussed previously by Yao et al. and Tietze et al.9,28 All μ-conotoxins, except μ-KIIIA, possess conserved
structures that align significantly better in the C-terminal part
compared to the N-terminal region.28 A
high similarity was seen for the backbone conformations between the
loop 2 and loop 3 regions of μ-KIIIA, μ-SIIIA, and μ-SmIIIA,
which have a higher selectivity for blocking NaV1.2 over
NaV1.4 channels (Table 1). On the other hand, μ-GIIIA and μ-PIIIA,
which prefer NaV1.4 over NaV1.2, superimpose
well in the second loop between C2 and C5.9 Besides contributing to the structural rigidity, the disulfide bridges
cause cysteine residues to form a hydrophobic core, enveloped by other
charged and hydrophilic residues (Figure 1). This hydrophobic effect plays a key role
in the stability of the native fold.35

With three disulfide bridges present, there are six ways to open
them one by one. The order of disulfide bond formation during the
synthesis (and also in vivo) is not known, but as mentioned before,
the process appears to be guided by thermodynamic aspects. Regarding
the simulation strategy, it was decided to open the longest disulfide
bridge first (bridging the longest sequence in between, see Table S1) as it is expected to instantly introduce
the highest level of flexibility into the peptide backbone. The intention
for this opening strategy was to increase the conformational entropy
of the reduced version. In the case of μ-KIIIA (non-native connectivity),
the shortest disulfide bridge was opened first. This would serve as
a means to gauge the effect of loop size in retaining a stable structure.
The loops in between the three disulfide bonds differ in size (Table S1) and thus needed to be considered in
the analysis process.

It was observed during the simulations
at room temperature that
all peptides retained their initial conformation as demonstrated by
the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of Cα atoms compared to
the chosen starting NMR structure of each peptide (Table 1) with μ-KIIIA possessing
the lowest RMSD of 1.1 Å and μ-SmIIIA the highest of 2.7
Å (Figure S1, Table S2). The RMSD of the Cα atoms, the root mean square
of fluctuation (RMSF) of all atoms of each residue, and the radius
of gyration (Rg) of the whole protein were computed from each simulation
for all of the five peptides (Figure S1, Table S2).

The native structure
of μ-GIIIA displayed a hydrophobic core
formed by the cysteines and a salt bridge between R1 and D12. As the
first disulfide bond C2–C5 was removed, the distance between
the now unbound cysteines increased moderately. However, this did
not affect the overall three-dimensional conformation of the backbone
proved by only a 0.3 Å increase in the backbone RMSD, but it
could be observed that its RMSD progression is inconsistent in the
simulation especially between 30 and 50 ns. The 300 ns simulation
showed that the peptide had a stable backbone indicated by a relatively
unwavering RMSD curve between 100 and 300 ns of simulation time as
shown in Figure 3.

of disulfide bond opened versions of the five μ-conotoxins.
The comparison of backbone stability between the peptides with the
C2–C5 disulfide bond removed (black) and both the C2–C5
and C3–C6 bridges removed (red) between 100 and 300 ns of simulation
time: (A) μ-GIIIA, (B) μ-KIIIA, (C) μ-PIIIA, (D)
μ-SIIIA, and (E) μ-SmIIIA. Above the plots is a representation
of two cases of disulfide connectivity discussed. Here, red represents
the version with the single C1–C4 disulfide bond and black
represents the C1–C4/C3–C6 disulfide connectivity.

Importantly, the residues significant
for bioactivity experienced
none to a very minimal increase in fluctuations (Figure 3, Table S4). Upon subsequent removal of the second disulfide bridge
between C3–C6, an obvious stretch in the overall shape of the
peptide was observed (Figure S3). The peptide
had an excessive flexibility and adopted close to completely unfolded
conformations during different intervals in the simulation (Figure S3). Interestingly, the cysteines forming
the C3–C6 bond moved much closer to each other than the C2–C5
cysteine residues in the two disulfide bond opened structure. This
is shown by the decrease in the RMSD of the C2–C5 and C3–C6
removed peptide between 60 and 70 ns (Figure S3). In longer time scales (300 ns), it was observed that the RMSD
values dropped close to the ones with just one disulfide bond (C2–C5)
removed, indicating that μ-GIIIA tends to fold back to retain
its preferred native conformation (Figure 3). The Rg of μ-GIIIA followed an almost
identical pattern of progression to the RMSD, peaking between 40 and
65 ns before falling back toward its initial values, representing
an unfolding-(re)folding event. The fluctuations of the residues K8,
K11, R13, K16, and R19, which were reported to be responsible for
ion channel binding,3 did not show a significant
change compared to the structure with all disulfide bonds intact (Table S3). With two disulfide bridges removed,
the C-terminus including R19 and K16 showed a significant increase
in fluctuations. It has been reported that K16 has a low priority
for biological activity. Moreover, the exchange of this residue increased
the binding affinity compared to the native toxin.36 Our findings suggest that if the C2–C5 disulfide
bond alone was removed, the structure may adopt a conformation still
representing a structure close to the native fold.

μ-KIIIA
has the lowest RMSD of 1.1 Å on average with
respect to the chosen starting structure among the five peptides in
their natively folded form (Table S2).
In 100 ns of simulation time, the removal of the C2–C4 disulfide
bond, thereby altering the C4 residue, results in the loss of its
helix and increases the RMSD by 0.7 Å. However, at the 300 ns
time scale, conformations sampled by μ-KIIIA showed the reappearance
of its native helix (Figure 5). The remaining C1–C5 and C3–C6 disulfide bonds
were sufficient to retain the backbone stability and conformation,
respectively, of μ-KIIIA. The progression of RMSD and Rg for
μ-KIIIA followed the same scheme as observed for μ-GIIIA,
that is, with the structure possessing two reduced disulfides revealing
the largest variation in the conformational flexibility. It was observed
from the 300 ns simulations that unlike μ-GIIIA, the two disulfide-deficient
versions of μ-KIIIA did not regain the backbone stability of
its one disulfide bond removed counterpart as shown in Figure 3.

Although the average
RMSD of native μ-PIIIA was a decent
2.3 Å compared to the selected starting structure over the course
of the simulation, the backbone was constantly subjected to changes
as can be seen from the RMSD plot (Figure S1). The removal of the C2–C5 disulfide bond resulted in a lesser
fluctuating RMSD progression, although it came at the expense of a
1.5 Å increase in RMSD in the first 100 ns of simulation time.
Conformations sampled by this peptide between 100 and 300 ns of simulation
time showed the reappearance of its native helices (α-helix
between O8 and S14 and 3_10 helix between L3 and C5). The structure
of μ-PIIIA with both the C2–C5 and C3–C6 disulfide
bonds removed showed the largest extent of structural variation among
the five conopeptides with an average RMSD of 4.9 Å (Figure S5). The peptide did not tend to refold
within 300 ns simulation time. With one disulfide bond removed, none
of its functionally significant residues showed a pronounced increase
in fluctuations, the highest of which was a 1.3 Å increase for
R14 compared to the natively folded peptides. Unlike μ-GIIIA,
the two disulfide-deficient versions of μ-PIIIA did not regain
the backbone stability of its one disulfide bond removed counterpart.
Meanwhile, the single disulfide-deficient version of μ-PIIIA
adopted a very stable conformation, with the RMSD curve almost flat
lining between 200 and 300 ns of the 300 ns simulation (Figure S3).

In contrast, almost all residues
of μ-SIIIA displayed marginally
higher RMSF values for the one and two bond-removed structures in
comparison to the native structure containing all the three disulfide
bonds. In the one disulfide-deficient version of μ-SIIIA, although
the marginal increase in residue fluctuations was observed, the functionally
significant restudies W12, R14, and H16 revealed only a minimal increase
in the overall residue fluctuations. Another key residue R18, however,
showed a larger mobility between the native and one disulfide-deficient
versions. More importantly, the one disulfide-deficient version of
μ-SIIIA retained its α-helical motif between K11 and H16,
which is a significant aspect in terms of targeting sodium channels.37

We focused further on μ-GIIIA that
forms a single oxidation
product and μ-SmIIIA that forms multiple oxidation products
during the synthesis to illustrate the phenomenon described above
(Figure S3). The overall RMSD between the
native connectivity and the structure with one disulfide bond removed
was observed to be low in μ-GIIIA (2.1 Å) and high in μ-SmIIIA
(2.9 Å) among the five peptides. Figure S3 shows average conformations for all the three 100 ns simulations
of μ-GIIIA and μ-SmIIIA compared with their corresponding
RMSD plots. An interesting observation from both peptides with an
opened disulfide bond was the formation of new secondary structure
elements that were not present in the native state. The structure
of C2–C5-deficient μ-GIIIA achieved a reasonable equilibration
between 200 and 300 ns of the simulation, and the inspection of the
trajectory revealed that the conformations sampled by this peptide
had a 3_10 helix between K16 and Q18 (Figure 3). In μ-SmIIIA with one opened disulfide
bond, an α-helix was formed between residues R13 and H18 (Figure 2).

The stability
of this helix through the entire course of the simulation
can be accounted for by a combination of hydrogen bond formation and
the presence of the bonded C15 in the center of the helix. In comparison
with the native fold, the structure with the C2–C5 bond opened
appeared well ordered. The distribution of the hydrogen bonds around
the helix can be seen in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Comparison of μ-SmIIIA native fold and the structure
with
one disulfide bond opened. (A) Structure of the native peptide (completely
oxidized, three disulfide bonds) with 100 conformations of its basic
residues (red) superimposed with three residues marked as important
for binding activity. The distribution of hydrogen bonds shows a sparse
black area which indicates that the region surrounding it is relatively
flexible. (B) Structure of the peptide containing one opened disulfide
bond (C2–C5) showing (blue) its well-formed α-helix and
the dense well-ordered hydrogen bonding illustrated as black cylinders.
Higher rigidity inducing an improved structural stability of the peptide
in (B) in comparison to the fully oxidized peptide in (A) is apparent
from the reference RMSF plot (C). Despite the rigidity of the backbone,
the orientations of the basic residues differ from the native structure.

The μ-SmIIIA structure with
two disulfide bonds reduced formed
a less stable 3_10 helix between residues R16 and H18, increasing
the flexibility of the conformation. However, the functionality of
a conotoxin is dependent on a stable backbone structure coupled with
the favorable orientation of basic side chain residues for binding
to their target and not solely on the flexibility of a distinct part
of the peptide.3 In μ-SmIIIA, though
the 3_10 helix formation reduced the Rg of the peptide, the overall
peptide structure drifted significantly from that of the native state,
and the orientations adopted by the side chains of its basic residues
varied largely when compared to either the native or the structure
with one disulfide bond opened. Even with a single disulfide bond
removed, the functionally significant R7 showed a moderate increase
in fluctuations (Figure 4, Table S4).

The 300 ns simulations
for the disulfide-deficient species of both
μ-SIIIA and μ-SmIIIA revealed similar trends based on
the observed RMSD progression (Figure 3). In the C2–C5 disulfide removed version, between
the two, μ-SmIIIA had a marginally more stable backbone than
μ-SIIIA. However, with the C3–C6 disulfide bond also
removed, both peptides had equally unstable backbones that did not
show signs of refolding. Herewith, it is demonstrated how the individual
disulfide bridges and the residues that occur within the loops affect
the conformational stability on the basis of observed fluctuations
in the backbone and the side chain residues.

A closer means
of observing the folding behavior of the peptides
in this study is to track the movement of the opened cysteine residues
in the simulation. By tracking the distances spanned by the Sγ
atoms of the cysteines, the tendency of the peptide to fold back to
its original conformation or to explore completely new conformations
can be identified. This behavior reflects on the underlying folding
model that the peptide prefers to adopt. On the basis of this idea,
we were able to find a clear correlation between the observations
from the synthesis (Figure 2) and simulation (Figure 6). The peptides that preferred forming distinct main
products (μ-GIIIA and μ-KIIIA) in the synthesis (Figure 2) also exhibited
their preference to fold back to their original conformations as seen
from the C2–C5 Sγ distance profiles in Figure 6. This is an indicator to the
preference of the BPTI-like folding pathway. On the other hand, μ-PIIIA
and μ-SmIIIA that formed a mixture of products in the synthesis
(Figure 2) preferred
moving away from their original conformations and exploring new conformations
as indicated by the C2–C5 Sγ distance profiles in Figure 6. This reflects on
the Hirudin-like folding pathway preferred by these peptides. The
behavior of μ-SIIIA could be placed between these two extreme
cases. The videos from the MD simulations where the distances between
the opened CYS residues were tracked are provided for the cases representing
the opposite extremes, namely, μ-GIIIA and μ-PIIIA are
provided as a part of the Supporting Information.

Conclusions
The folding of smaller disulfide-rich peptides
and oligopeptides
is a less well-understood folding event because of a much higher degree
of flexibility and often a lower extent of structure-forming elements.
MD simulations are increasingly used to assist the experimental work
for understanding and predicting the folding process. Additionally,
they have been routinely used in structure–activity relationship
studies, drug discovery, and design pipelines.38−42 Previous studies using the five μ-conotoxins
investigated herein gave insights into the folding and binding modes
adopted by these peptides.9,25,28,32,36,43 Simulating the complete oxidative folding pathway following the
formation of non-native disulfide intermediates until the native disulfide
bonds are formed as reported by previous studies44,45 using coarse-grained models is not within the scope of this study.
Our work, however, aimed at determining how a particular disulfide
bond contributes to the stability of the peptide. Consequently, this
approach reviews the validity of the logic that the removal of a disulfide
bridge, that is, herein C2–C5, represents a reduction of the
backbone stability when considering RMSD and RMSF values.

With
the C2–C5 disulfide bond removed, only μ-SmIIIA
revealed a noticeable increase in the average fluctuations of its
functionally significant residues. In addition, the fact that secondary
structural elements such as α-helices were formed in some peptides
containing only two disulfide bonds suggests that in distinct cases
(e.g., μ-GIIIA), a greater structural rigidity of the backbone
may be achieved if one disulfide bridge is removed. This helix-induced
stability while strengthening the backbone might reduce the extent
of overall fluctuations of the basic residues responsible for binding
activity. The biological activity and selectivity of disulfide-deficient
mutants might differ from the native conformation as shown for μ-GIIIA
recently. Fifteen different disulfide isomers are possible for a peptide
containing six cysteines, and still three different isomers (ribbon,
bead, and globular) might occur in case of four cysteines. It has,
however, not been mentioned in the report by Han et al.46 which isomer of the μ-GIIIA analogs has
been tested because the structural characterization of the respective
products was not performed. Apart from the reports on μ-GIIIA
regarding the disulfide-deficient variants, another study by Khoo
et al.47 provides an insight into the removal
of disulfide bridge C1–C9 in μ-KIIIA, resulting in only
a minimal change in the biological activity against NaV1.2 and NaV1.4. In contrast, there are no experimental
data for the disulfide-deficient species of μ-conotoxins PIIIA,
SIIIA, and SmIIIA available so far.

With respect to drug design
and synthesis, the simplification to
two disulfide bonds would be a clear benefit for disulfide-rich peptides
and proteins. A similar study by Yu et al. on α-conotoxin cVc1.1
complements our idea of the reduction of the number of disulfide bonds.49 In this respect, we can conclude from our MD
simulations that two disulfide bridges could be sufficient to maintain
a stable backbone for the majority of the μ-conotoxins studied.
However, it is important that the deficient structure is sufficiently
supported by at least one pair of cross-linked disulfide bridges that
span to almost either ends of the sequence. From the results obtained,
a rank order of the five peptides can be provided: μ-GIIIA and
μ-KIIIA fall in the highly favorable category, μ-SIIIA
falls in the moderately favorable group, and μ-PIIIA and μ-SmIIIA
fall into the least favorable group (Figure 5). We also conclude
that the C3–C6 disulfide bridge plays the greatest role in
retaining the backbone stability for the current strategy of disulfide
bond removal employed.

native structure (black cartoon representation). From the 300 ns trajectory,
five conformations (one every 60 ns) have been used. The average RMSD
of these conformations in comparison to the reference native structure
is shown in Å. Besides displaying the regions of similarity and
dissimilarity between the native and the C2–C5-deficient versions,
the figure also provides a grouping for the five peptides in terms
of favorability of the disulfide-deficient version retaining structural
characteristics of the native peptide (based on RMSD, RMSF, and Rg).

As expected, the removal of two
disulfide bridges led to an increased
backbone flexibility, the formation of a series of intermediate conformations,
and a less stable peptide. The increased fluctuations of basic side
chain residues responsible for the interactions with the sodium ion
channels are in this case unlikely to stay in favorable orientations
for binding. Furthermore, the formation of different disulfide isomers
for μ-KIIIA, μ-PIIIA, and μ-SmIIIA in the experimental
self-folding approach indicates a difference in their folding behavior,9,17,25,29 which cannot be explained unambiguously by simulations and disulfide
removal. Finally, the observations of the structural stability of
the backbone observed and the extent to which the peptide tries to
fold back gives us clues on which disulfide folding model a particular
peptide tends to likely prefer. It must be said that this distinction
is still not completely in black and white but can be ranked or ordered
relative to each other between the extreme models (BPTI and hirudin).
Our attempt to classify the peptides between the BPTI and hirudin
folding models is illustrated in Figure 6. The correlation
of observations from the experiment and simulation as discussed earlier
in the results adds further validity to this classification proposed
in Figures 5 and 6. Thus, we have been able to demonstrate the usefulness
of molecular simulations in applications beyond the observation of
the structural behavior of a peptide in solution to being used as
a tool for the generalized assignment of peptides to established folding
models.

Materials and Methods
MD Simulations
Disulfide bonds were systematically
removed to yield a partially folded conformation as the starting structure
for the simulation. From an atomic perspective, this translates to
changing the bonded cysteines to nonbonded cysteines by protonating
the sulfur atoms. This step was done by pdb2gmx program within the
GROMACS 5.1.4 package.50,51 This approach induces the least
changes in the coordinate file to create a disulfide-deficient species
as opposed to the usually performed mutation studies where the Cys
residues are replaced by the Ala or Ser residues. It further eliminates
the errors arising from the manual manipulation of the coordinate
file. Four out of five μ-conotoxins in this study possess the
native disulfide connectivity (C1–C4/C2–C5/C3–C6),
whereas μ-KIIIA adopts a C1–C5/C2–C4/C3–C6
connection as the stable conformation.25 The following structures were used herein: PDB ID 1TCG (μ-GIIIA),22 PDB ID 2LXG (μ-KIIIA),25 S00159
(μ-PIIIA),9 BMRB 20025 (μ-SIIIA),28 and PDB ID 1Q2J (μ-SmIIIA).29 The NMR ensembles of μ-GIIIA, μ-KIIIA, μ-SIIIA,
and μ-SmIIIA had 20 structures and μ-PIIIA had 15 structures
in the respective PDB file. The first model was selected as the best
representative structure except for SmIIIA, whereas model 13 was chosen
as mentioned in the PDB file as the best model for this peptide.

GROMACS 5.1.450,51 was used for all the MD simulations
in this study. An individual peptide was placed in the center of a
cubic box that evolved to a final volume of 2.5 × 2.5 ×
2.5 nm3. TIP3P52 water model
was used as the solvent to fill the box. Appropriate amounts of Cl– ions were added to balance the positive charge of
the μ-conotoxins. Simulations were run using the AMBER99SB-ILDN53 force field, which was chosen based on its better
agreement with the NMR data and an accurate modeling of helical proteins
in comparative studies.54−56 In the process of preparing the
peptide for the production MD simulation, energy minimization simulations
were with 10 000 steps of the steepest descents minimization
protocol and convergence reached when the maximum force on any atom
is no greater than 100 kJ/mol/nm. A thermal equilibration in the NVT
ensemble at 300 K using the velocity-rescaling modified Berendsen
thermostat57 and a constant pressure equilibration
in the NPT ensemble using the Parrinello–Rahman barostat58,59 at 1 atm were carried out for 20 ns each, prior to production MD.
During both the temperature and the pressure ensemble simulations,
positional restraints on the peptides were applied using the LINCS60 algorithm. Each peptide was subjected to three
production runs, and on each run, preprocessing and equilibration
were performed independently. First, the conformation with all the
three disulfide bonds was considered as the control simulation. In
the second simulation, the link between C2–C5 (C2–C4
for KIIIA) was removed leaving the two other disulfide bonds intact.
In the third simulation, both the C2–C5 (C2–C4 for KIIIA)
and the C3–C6 disulfide bonds were removed, leaving the peptide
constrained originally by three disulfide bonds now supported by a
single disulfide bonds. The production MD was done for 100 ns for
all the peptides, and for instances with the opening of a single or
two disulfide bonds, a total of 300 ns of simulations were carried
out by running an extended 200 ns simulation from the final checkpoint
of the 100 ns trajectory. The extended 200 ns simulations were conducted
to allow sufficient sampling for the observation of events from the
refolding process such as the possibility of the unbound cysteines
coming close to each other. All simulations were conducted with a
2 fs time step and data written to the logs and trajectory at every
5 ps. Periodic boundary conditions were applied to the system. Long-range
electrostatics were accounted by the particle mesh Ewald method.61,62 For every 100 ns of simulation, 20 000 frames were written
to the trajectory. The effect of periodic boundary conditions was
adjusted by the suppression of center of mass movement from the trajectory
prior to analysis. Visualizations of conformations for the analysis
and creation of images were performed using VMD.63 The RMSD, RMSF, and Rg plots were created using the program
Grace (version 5.1.25), whereas the distances between the unbound
cysteines were plotted using the tools within VMD. The RMSD curves
were plotted for every 10 ps (10 000 frames), whereas the distance
curves were plotted for every 5 ps (20 000 frames).

Chemical
Synthesis and Purification of μ-Conotoxins
Peptides
were produced by an automated solid-phase peptide synthesis
using a standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl)-protocol
and an EPS 221 peptide synthesizer (Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments
AG, Cologne, Germany) as described earlier and purified by preparative
reversed-phase (RP) HPLC (Shimadzu LC-8A system, Duisburg, Germany).
The gradient used was 0–50% eluent B in 120 min with 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) in water (eluent A) and 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile/water
(9:1) (eluent B) on a C18 column (Knauer Eurosphere 100, Berlin, Germany)
with the dimensions 50 mm × 300 mm (5 mm particle size, 100 Å
pore size). Reduced and oxidized peptides were analyzed on a LC–ESI
micrOTOF-Q III mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany)
coupled with Dionex Ultimate 3000 (Thermo Scientific, Dreieich, Germany)
equipped with a EC100/2 Nucleoshell RP18 Gravity 2.7 μm column
(Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Analysis of the MS data was
performed using Bruker Compass Data Analysis 4.1. The LC conditions
used were as follows: eluent A was water with 0.1% acetic acid, whereas
eluent B was acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid. A gradient
of 0–60% of eluent B in 12 min was used, and detection was
at 220 nm.

Oxidation of Reduced μ-Conotoxin Precursors
Oxidative
folding of the linear μ-conotoxins GIIIA, KIIIA, PIIIA, SIIIA,
and SmIIIA in a buffer system containing redox agents was performed
as described earlier. Each μ-conotoxin (1 mg) was subjected
to oxidation, and fractions of the reaction mixture were monitored
over time by RP HPLC using a Shimadzu LC-10AT system (Duisburg, Germany)
equipped with a C18 column (Vydac 218TP54, Worms, Germany, 4.6 mm
× 25 mm, 5 mm particle size, 300 Å pore size) and the gradient
0–60% eluent B in 60 min with 0.1% TFA in water (eluent A)
and 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile (eluent B). Reaction control was performed
over a time period of 24 h, and oxidation was stopped by adding 1%
TFA in water. Monitoring revealed that the oxidation reactions were
completed within the first 60 min of the reaction time. The fractions
were collected for each peptide and subjected to LC–ESI mass
spectrometry for the confirmation of the molar mass corresponding
to the oxidized products.
