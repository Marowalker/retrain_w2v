A temperature-responsive
near-infrared reflective coating was fabricated
based on a side-chain liquid crystal siloxane polymer using a simple
wired-bar method. The cholesteric liquid crystalline polymer film
showed a blue shift of the reflection band of ∼1000 nm in the
IR region upon heating. The temperature-responsive change of the reflection
band was reversible. Compared to that of the same mixture system in
an alignment cell, the coating showed a significantly faster response.
This research demonstrates
an easy way to prepare a temperature-responsive IR-reflective coating
that shifts its reflection to a shorter wavelength upon heating. As
IR radiation of shorter wavelengths is more strongly represented in
sunlight than longer wavelengths, this coating could be used to selectively
reduce heating of an indoor space when the temperature is high. This
is promising for the future application of smart climate control.

Introduction
Near-infrared (NIR)
light, ranging from 700 to 2500 nm, makes up
50% of the total sunlight energy that reaches earth and is a significant
interior heating source of buildings.1 Transmission
and reflection of NIR from sunlight can be regulated by specialized
windows, which can reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling
of buildings while still being transparent for visible light.2−5 Smart temperature-responsive IR reflectors autonomously regulate
the temperature of indoor spaces.6 As IR
radiation of shorter wavelengths is more strongly represented in sunlight
than longer wavelengths,7 a window that
shifts its reflection to a shorter wavelength upon heating rejects
more IR at higher temperatures, which reduces heating of the indoor
space. If this can be done in a reversible and autonomous way, it
would be a major step toward the construction of energy-neutral buildings.

Temperature-responsive photonic materials are the key to this kind
of smart window, as such materials can change their reflection of
light in response to temperature changes. The reflected wavelength
of photonic materials, which operate as Bragg reflectors, is determined
by periodic structures. The reported temperature-responsive photonic
systems are based on cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs),8−10 polymeric colloids,11−13 or thermoplastic materials.14−18 Temperature-responsive photonic hydrogel polymer
coatings have been made for temperature sensors and indicators.19,20 These hydrogel coatings rely on swelling and deswelling by water
and thus require specific humidity conditions.

CLCs are an interesting
category of temperature-responsive photonic
materials, which can operate under dry conditions. CLCs can be obtained
by introducing a chiral dopant into a nematic LC. The chiral dopant
causes helical twisting of the average orientation (director) of the
molecules, which induces selective Bragg-type reflection of light.
As only one handedness of circular polarization is reflected, a maximum
of 50% of ambient light can be reflected for a single handedness of
the helix. The pitch of the helix (the distance over which the alignment
director makes a 2π rotation) in these systems determines the
wavelength of reflection.21,22 This pitch can be modified
in response to temperature, resulting in a change in the reflection
wavelength. For CLCs that also have a smectic phase, large shifts
of the reflection band have been reported at temperature changes just
above the smectic to chiral nematic transition temperature. The transition
to the smectic phase “unwinds” the helix as the smectic–cholesteric
phase transition is approached, resulting in a red shift of the reflection
band.23−29 In this way, temperature-responsive reflective systems have been
developed for various purposes.10,25,30−34 Among them, a film made of a CLC elastomer shows reversible reflection
band shifting by thermal deformation.35 However, in the fabrication methods to prepare these systems, the
LC is brought into a narrow gap between two glass plates with alignment
layers on the inside (an alignment cell), which limits their applications.
Polymer-dispersed systems seem to be a good alternative for easier
fabrication of temperature-responsive reflective coatings,36 but these have the tendency to be opaque due
to the scattering of visible light. Easy procedures, such as knife
coating, have been adopted for making static CLC color coatings37 but never for responsive ones. As such, the
development of a facile method to fabricate transparent temperature-responsive
polymer IR-reflective coatings remains a challenge.

We now report
on the fabrication of a temperature-responsive IR-reflective
coating using a simple wired-bar method. The photonic polymer film
was based on a mixture of a side-chain liquid crystalline polysiloxane
homopolymer (HP)8,38,39 and 10% of chiral dopant S811 (Scheme 1), which has a Sm–N* phase transition.
A 1000 nm reversible blue shift of the reflection band within the
IR region was observed upon increasing the temperature from room temperature
to 60 °C. The same system in a cell showed a similar change of
the reflection band as a function of temperature, but the coating
showed a significantly faster response. These results show that easily
processable responsive photonic coatings can be fabricated, which
function similar to responsive systems in cells. The main advantage
of using a coating is that it can be applied without the use of a
glass cell. This is important because in many practical applications
the use of a cell is not desirable or possible, such as for large,
uneven, or curved surfaces.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
and Characterization of the LC Mixture
The side-chain liquid
crystalline HP was synthesized by grafting
an olefinic LC onto a polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) backbone in the
presence of Karstedt’s catalyst. The structure of the HP was
confirmed by attenuated total reflectance IR spectroscopy (ATR-IR, Figure S1), gel permeation chromatography (GPC),
and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR, Figure S2). The average degree of polymerization
was 6.3 while the polydispersity was 1.21 (Table S1). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that
the polymer has both the desired smectic and nematic phases (G-8 Sm
20.7 N 75 I, Figure S3).

An IR-reflecting
chiral nematic LC mixture was created by adding 10 wt % chiral dopant
S811 to the HP (Scheme 1), dissolving the mixture in dichloromethane (DCM), and evaporating
the solvent overnight. The mixture had a cholesteric liquid crystalline
phase between 22 and 64 °C, an intermediate mesophase between
−10 and 22 °C, and glass transition at −10 °C.
Wide-angle and small-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS and SAXS) measurements
(Figure 1) showed a
diffraction peak located at q = 0.24 Å–1 (2θ = 3.386°, d = 2.6 nm) at ≤60
°C, which is a typical indication
of the smectic order. The peak in the WAXS measurement at q = 1.5 Å–1 represents the side-by-side
intermolecular spacing, which is present in both the nematic and smectic
phases. When the smectic order is present in a nematic or cholesteric
phase, this is known as a cybotactic structure.40,41 The existence of cybotactic structures in the entire cholesteric
temperature range, combined with a peak intensity increase with decreasing
temperature, reveals a gradual pretransitional effect of this system,
indicating a gradual change from a cholesteric order to a smectic
order.

temperatures upon cooling.

Temperature Response of the HP–S811 Polymer Coating
The mixture of HP–S811 was coated at 52 °C on a glass
surface with a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) alignment layer using a wired
bar. After processing, a transparent colorless 11.5 μm thick
coating was obtained (Scheme 1c). Polarizing optical microscopy (POM) analysis showed typical
planar cholesteric textures (Figure S4).
The stripes that were observed originated from the micro pattern of
the coating bar and did not significantly influence coating transparency
and properties.

The thermo-optical properties of the coating
were investigated using ultraviolet–visible–IR (UV/vis/IR)
spectroscopy. Figure 2 presents the stabilized transmission spectra of a coating at different
temperatures in two heating and cooling cycles. The bandwidth of each
reflection peak was calculated from full width at half-maximum (FWHM)
reflection, and the Bragg reflection center (λB)
was determined by the middle point of the FWHM line. The spectrum
taken first at 47.5 °C (Figure 2a, 47.5 °C initial) had a reflection band centered
at λB = ∼1380 nm. The reflection band had
a triangle-like shape with a FWHM of 210 nm. In the first cycle, between
56.7 and 30 °C, the reflection band shifted from 1225 to 2026
nm (Figure 2a). In
the second cycle, upon further cooling to 16.5 °C, the reflection
band did not disappear but was centered at 2310 nm (Figure 2b). During the two cycles,
the reflection band showed a reversible change as a function of temperature.
Some scattering was also observed, which was visible as a lower transparency
in the visible light region of the spectra. The scattering increased
as the temperature decreased, and finally at 16.5 °C, below the
Sm–N* transition point, scattering reached the highest degree.
POM images displayed a new “fingerprint” texture at
lower temperatures, indicating a homeotropic alignment of the helices
(Figure S4), which could account for the
scattering of the coating. This homeotropic alignment of mesogens
at the air–coating interface could be more favorable due to
lower surface tensions.42,43 The fingerprint structure
was more obvious on top of the planar textures when a coating surface
was obtained by a 10 μm narrow gap applicator (Figure S5). In another experiment, the temperature was raised
beyond the cholesteric to isotropic transition point. This wiped out
the alignment of the molecules as expected. When the temperature was
then lowered back to the cholesteric range, the LCs realigned poorly
and the coating became highly scattering. This should not hurt the
practical application of the coating as it is meant to be used in
the built environment, where such high temperatures should not be
reached.

and (b) 47.6 and 16.5 °C. (c) Reflection wavelength (λB) of the HP–S811 coating as a function of temperature.

Temperature Response of
the HP–S811 Cell
For
comparison, the thermo-optic behavior of the HP–S811 mixture
was also studied in a cell. The spectrum of the cell exhibited an
IR reflection peak centered at λB = 1390 nm at 52
°C with a transmittance of 65%. The cell was fully transparent
in the visible region, indicating planar alignment of the LCs. Compared
to that of the coating, the FWHM of this band was much smaller (112
nm), and its
shape was not triangular. This can be explained by the absence of
a fingerprint texture, which does not form due to the lack of an air
interface and leads to a sharper band and less scattering. The temperature
of the cell was varied between 66 and 16 °C. Figure 3a shows the temperature-dependent
reflection spectra measured after stabilization. The spectra show
the same gradual change of the reflection center along the temperature
range as was observed in the coating. In the CLC temperature range,
a 1000 nm red shift of λB was observed, that is,
λB increased from 1215 to 2190 nm. This wavelength
shift was fully reversible, as two heating and cooling cycles between
66 and 30 °C showed the same behavior (Figure S6). Below the Sm–N* transition point (22 °C),
the reflection
bands were only partially visible due to light absorption of the glass
cell but remained at the same position. This is similar to what was
seen before in the coating.

Figure 3 (a) Stabilized transmission spectra and (b)
reflection wavelength
(λB) of the HP–S811 cell as a function of
temperature. The dashed lines and hollow dots refer to the spectral
data partly out of the machine detection range.

Upon plotting the wavelength of the reflection band (λB) against temperature (Figure 3b), gradual reflection band shifts were observed. This
behavior is different from the Sm–N* systems reported earlier,
in which drastic reflection band shifting takes place within a few
degrees of temperature.44 The gradual reflection
band shift coincides with the gradual increase in the smectic order
in the CLC phase, as observed by WAXS and SAXS (Figure 1). Most likely, as reported for other systems,
this smectic order increase led to a gradual increase in pitch, leading
to a red shift of the reflection band.45,46 Below the
Sm–N* transition point, the reflection band was not changing,
revealing that the pitch did not change at these temperatures. It
should be noted that the slight decrease of the helical twisting power
of chiral dopant S811 with decreasing temperature will only have a
minor contribution to the gradual λB change.47,48

Response Time of the HP–S811 Cell and Coating
We
studied the response time of the thermo-optical changes of the
polymer LC mixture with respect to the reflection band shift and transparency
changes. Figure 4 shows
a comparison of the response of both the coating and cell upon cooling
from 39 to 30 °C (Figure 4a,b) and heating from 30 to 39 °C (Figure 4c,d). Interestingly, the responsive behavior
of the coating was different when compared to that of the cell. Upon
cooling the cell, the shift of the reflection band took place over
160 min (Figure 4a),
whereas the transparency of the cell did not change and stayed high
(Figure 4b). In contrast,
upon heating, the reflection band shifted in less than 10 min (Figure 4c), whereas the transparency
initially dropped significantly due to scattering (from 98 to 65%)
and recovered only after 410 min (Figure 4d). For the coating, the shift of the reflection
band was significantly faster upon cooling compared to that of the
cell (60 vs 160 min, Figure 4a), also without any drop in transparency (Figure 4b). Upon heating, the change
of the reflection band was also faster compared to that in the cell
(5 vs 10 min, Figure 4c). The coating had a lower initial transparency compared to that
of the cell, but upon heating, its transmittance dropped by only 5%
due to scattering (Figure 4d), and it quickly recovered in 20 min. During heating, POM
images of the coating (Figure S4) and the
cell (Figure S7) showed the formation of
focal conic textures, revealing a decrease in alignment. Even when
heating at a very slow rate of 0.1 °C/min, this disorder was
inevitable. At other temperatures, the effects were similar, and this
data is summarized in Table S2. At lower
temperatures, a longer time was needed to obtain a transparent cell
in the visible region. To make sure that the difference in kinetics
between the cell and the coating was not caused by a temperature difference,
we measured the temperature during and after the ramp. The temperature
of the cell and coating differed by less than 1 °C and vanished
entirely after the ramp. This small temperature difference cannot
be the cause for the large difference in kinetics that we observed.

the temperature ramp, and the solid symbols describe the data points
collected once the temperature has stabilized.

On the Mechanism of the Temperature-Responsive IR-Reflective
Cells and Coatings
The thickness of the coating (11.5 μm)
was shown to change only marginally with temperature (Figure S8). This reveals that the HP–S811
system undergoes helix winding and unwinding during pitch tuning without
noticeable thermal expansion or shrinkage along the helical axis.
The thickness in the cell is fixed by the cell gap; therefore, the
response mechanism of the cell and coating should be similar. We argue
that the faster response of the coating stems from the lack of a top
alignment layer. In the cell, where the stronger anchoring force determines
the alignment of the mesogens on both surfaces, helices can wind or
unwind only by discontinuous jumps of integral π rotations,49,50 which may set an energy barrier to pitch changing. In the coating,
winding and unwinding of helices can take place without integer π
rotations and barriers are therefore removed, leading to a faster
response. The scattering at intermediate temperatures is caused by
the formation of focal conic defects. At a high temperature, the mixture
has a low viscosity and the alignment, driven by the anchoring force
of alignment layers, is fast. At a low temperature, where the helical
pitch is long, planar alignment is thermodynamically favorable.24,51 However, at intermediate temperatures, neither is planar alignment
favorable nor is the viscosity low enough to quickly recover the focal
conic defects. Remarkably, the reflection band did not disappear upon
going from the N* to the Sm state, even though the temperature was
still above Tg. We assume that below the
transition temperature the mixture system adopts a twist grain boundary
(TGB A*) phase, an intermediate phase of transition where smectic
clusters form a macroscopic spiraling layer structure, which possesses
helical pitches as well.52,53

Conclusions
In this article, a mixture consisting of an LC polysiloxane and
the chiral dopant S811 has been prepared to fabricate an easily processable
temperature-responsive IR-reflective coating. The photonic coating
showed a blue shift in the reflection wavelength of light along a
broad range in the IR region (2350–1250 nm) upon heating and
was reversible. Interestingly, the response of the coating was considerably
faster compared to that of the same material in a glass cell. This
makes such a coating appealing as a temperature-responsive IR reflector
that can autonomously regulate the temperature of indoor spaces. In
the future, the reflection band of the coating can be fine-tuned to
a different wavelength of IR by changing the amount of chiral dopant
in the mixture.

Our research shows that side-chain LC polymers
can be applied as
coatable temperature-responsive IR-reflective films, opening up a
promising route toward the development of smart windows that can be
applied directly on various surfaces. Because the temperature and
optical response mechanisms of the coating are similar to those of
the cell, this reveals that other response mechanisms already reported
for a cell can now also be applied to coatings, opening up new opportunities
to fabricate temperature-responsive polymers with novel properties.

J&K Chemical (China). 6-Bromo-1-hexene was purchased from Heowns
Biochem Technologies (China). 4-Methoxyphenol and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
were obtained from Adamas Reagent, Ltd. (China). 4-Dimethylaminopyridine
was received from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (China).
PMHS (trimethylsilyl-terminated, average Mn ∼390), platinum(0)-1,3-divinyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane

and anhydrous toluene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chiral dopant
S811 was bought from Jiangsu Hecheng Advanced Materials Co., Ltd.
(China). All materials were used as received without further purification.

Characterization
The compounds were characterized by
ATR-IR (Bruker VERTEX 70) and by 1H NMR (Varian AS400;
400 MHz) using chloroform-d. The HP was analyzed
by a GPC (Waters e2695) system equipped with a refractive index detector
(Waters 2414) using tetrahydrofuran as eluent and monodisperse polystyrene
calibration standards. Phase transition temperatures of the HP were
measured by DSC (Mettler Toledo DSC 1) using heating and cooling rates
of 2 °C/min. The mixture was analyzed by both WAXS and SAXS (Ganesha
lab instrument) at various temperatures. Optical textures of the cells
and coatings were investigated by POM (Leica DM 7200P or Leica DM
2700M) with a hot stage (Linkam PE95/T95). Transmission spectra of
the cells and coatings were obtained with a UV/vis/NIR spectrometer
(PerkinElmer Lambda 950) with a two-dimensional detector module. The
temperature of the sample was controlled by a water-agent temperature
controller (EYELA NCB-1200) and was calibrated by a thermoelectric
couple. The thickness of the coating was measured by an interferometer
(Forgale Zoomsurf 3D).

Preparation of HP
The HP was synthesized
by grafting
olefinic LC 4-methoxyphenyl 4-(5-hexenyloxy) benzoate onto a polymethylhydrosiloxane
backbone in the presence of Karstedt’s catalyst as previously
reported.54,55 A detailed synthetic procedure and characterization
can be found in the Supporting Information.

Preparation of the CLC Polysiloxane Mixture
The HP
(205.8 mg) and chiral dopant S811 (22.9 mg, 10 wt %) were dissolved
in DCM. The solvent was slowly evaporated on a 55 °C hot plate
and further removed in high vacuum at 70 °C overnight to yield
a homogenous polysiloxane–chiral dopant mixture.

Fabrication
of the IR-Reflective Coatings
A few drops
of a 5.0 wt % PVA in aqueous solution were spin-coated onto 3 ×
3 cm2 clean glass plates at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The deposited
films were dried at 60.0 °C for about 1 h and subsequently rubbed
on a velvet textile cloth in one direction to induce alignment. The
glass plate with the PVA alignment layer was then placed on a hot
plate at 52 °C. A coating bar having a surface microstructure
with a waviness height of 24.4 μm and a wavelength of 202.6
μm was heated to 52 °C. The LC mixture was put on one side
of the glass plate and coated by the bar in the direction antiparallel
to the PVA layer rubbing direction. The bar was moved over the plate
several times until the material was fully covering the plate. The
resulting coating was stored on the hot plate at 52 °C. The coating
in Figure S5 was obtained using a narrow
gap applicator instead of the rod.

Preparation of IR-Reflective
Cells
Two of the glass
plates with the rubbed PVA alignment layer were imposed antiparallel
on each other and glued together using a UV glue containing 15 μm
silica particles as spacers. The mixture was filled into the cell
at 52 °C by capillary forces.
