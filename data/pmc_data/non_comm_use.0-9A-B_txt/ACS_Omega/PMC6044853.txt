We
have recently identified a new class of filamenting temperature-sensitive
mutant Z (FtsZ)-interacting compounds that possess a 2,4,6-trisubstituted
pyrimidine–quinuclidine scaffold with moderate antibacterial
activity. Employing this scaffold as a molecular template, a compound
library of amine-linked 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyrimidines with 99 candidates
was successfully established by employing an efficient convergent
synthesis designed to explore their structure–activity relationship.
The results of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay against Staphylococcus aureus strains and cytotoxicity assay
against the mouse L929 cell line identified those compounds with potent
antistaphylococcal properties (MIC ranges from 3 to 8 μg/mL)
and some extent of cytotoxicity against normal cells (IC50 ranges from 6 to 27 μM). Importantly, three compounds also
exhibited potent antibacterial activities against nine clinically
isolated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. One of the compounds, 14av_amine16,
exhibited low spontaneous frequency of resistance, low toxicity against Galleria mellonella larvae, and the ability to rescue G. mellonella larvae (20% survival rate at a dosage
of 100 mg/kg) infected with a lethal dose of MRSA ATCC 43300 strain.
Biological characterization of compound 14av_amine16 by
saturation transfer difference NMR, light scattering assay, and guanosine
triphosphatase hydrolysis assay with purified S. aureus FtsZ protein verified that it interacted with the FtsZ protein.
Such a property of FtsZ inhibitors was further confirmed by observing
iconic filamentous cell phenotype and mislocalization of the Z-ring
formation of Bacillus subtilis. Taken
together, these 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyrimidine derivatives represent
a novel scaffold of S. aureus FtsZ
inhibitors.

1 Introduction
The
inexorable rise in the incidence of serious bacterial infections
caused by multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria in health care- and
community-associated settings has become a pressing threat of public
health worldwide.1 Of particular concern
is the rise in the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. MRSA can
cause a wide range of illnesses, from mild skin and wound infections
to pneumonia and bloodstream infections that cause sepsis and death.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States
estimates that over 80 000 severe MRSA infections occur annually,
resulting in 11 000 deaths.2 This
scenario has driven the search for novel classes of antistaphylococcal
agents which act on novel bacterial drug targets.

The bacterial
cell division machinery has been considered as an
important field for exploring potential novel drug targets of antibacterial
agents.3 The filamenting temperature-sensitive
mutant Z (FtsZ) protein undoubtedly represents one of the well-characterized
and exploitable antibacterial drug targets.4−10 FtsZ is a cytoplasmic protein and highly conserved tubulin-like
guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase), playing an important role in bacterial
cell division. In order for bacteria to carry out cell division, FtsZ
monomers are required to localize mid cells through the precise positioning
of cell division site positioning proteins and self-polymerize into
single stranded straight protofilaments by means of head-to-tail association
that curve upon the hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) molecules.11 Consecutive lateral contacts between FtsZ protofilaments
produce FtsZ bundles, which eventually lead to the formation of a
contractile ring called Z-ring at the mid cell. Following the subsequent
involvement of other downstream cell division proteins, Z-ring contraction
and depolymerization complete the cell division process to furnish
identical daughter cells. Small molecules interfering the initial
stage of the FtsZ polymerization are capable of blocking bacterial
cell division, causing the abrogation of bacterial cell viability
eventually. These types of compounds have great potential to be developed
as efficacious antimicrobial agents with a novel mode of action for
clinical applications. Several high-resolution X-ray crystal structures
of FtsZ homologues have been reported.12 These results contributed to the knowledge regarding the general
organization of the FtsZ protein structure, which is known to comprise
two independent folding domains (Figure 1). The N-terminal domain forms a nucleotide-binding
site (GTP-binding site, the upper red circle of Figure 1), whereas the C-terminal domain contains
a flexible loop (T7 loop). Both the domains were interconnected via
a long central helix 7 (H7) of high rigidity.

Figure 1 Crystal structure of S. aureus FtsZ
(PDB ID: 4DXD) with labeled GTP-binding site (red circle), T7 loop, central H7,
and amino acids at positions 193, 196, and 263. The black oval indicates
the binding site of PC190723. The chemical structures of PC190723,
zantrin Z3, and FtsZ inhibitors 1–7 are shown.

Many FtsZ-interacting compounds
have been discovered and reported
to bind either the GTP-binding site or a cleft formed by the H7, T7
loop, and C-terminal β sheet (Figure 1, black oval). Some exhibit potent antibacterial
activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at the micromolar
range. PC190723 (Figure 1, top left)13−15 and its prodrugs 1a,161b,17−19 and benzamide 2(20) have been demonstrated to exhibit in vitro and
in vivo efficacy in a murine infection model. Moreover, X-ray crystallographic
analysis revealed that PC190723 binds to a narrow cleft formed by
the H7, T7 loop, and C-terminal β sheet (Figure 1, black oval).21 However, analysis of PC190723 drug-resistant mutants across various
MRSA strains revealed that all PC190723 drug-resistant isolates had
multiple mutations, resulting in amino acid substitutions that mapped
to the FtsZ protein.22 These mutations
mainly occurred at amino acid positions 193, 196, and 263 (Figure 1), which accounted
for over 90% of PC190723 drug-resistant mutants. These results suggested
that amino acid substitutions can alter slightly the overall shape
of the binding pocket without interfering the normal function of FtsZ.
Nevertheless, this change resulted in PC190723 no longer binding to
this pocket, therefore causing drug resistance. Such findings may
hinder the potential of PC190723 and other related compounds23 from being developed into agents that exhibit
the potential to target the same binding pocket for further clinical
development. On the other hand, several compounds targeting the GTP-binding
site of FtsZ have also been demonstrated to exhibit potent antibacterial
activity, including zantrin Z3,24,25 natural product chrysophaentin
A 3,26 C8-substituted GTP
analogues 4,27,28 berberine analogues 5,29,30 and naphthol derivatives 6(31,32) (Figure 1, right). Surprisingly, among these inhibitors, no
drug-resistant mutants have been reported in the literature so far,
presumably because of the fact that the GTP-binding site is very important
for recognizing the GTP molecules. Amino acid substitutions at this
binding pocket may cause improper recognition of GTP molecules and
thus hinder normal GTP hydrolysis process, therefore losing the energy
source to drive the polymerization of FtsZ monomers. We reasoned that
specially designed small molecules, which can mimic and compete with
GTP molecules to bind the GTP-binding site of FtsZ, may have greater
potential to be developed as antimicrobial agents without acquiring
drug resistance.

To take advantage of this idea, we have employed
a combined approach
of high-throughput virtual screening and biological evaluation of
natural product libraries to discover compounds with new chemical
scaffolds that target the GTP-binding site of the FtsZ protein. Our
previous study identified a new class of FtsZ inhibitor 7 bearing a 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyrimidine and a chiral aminoquinuclidine
moiety (Figure 1, bottom
right).33 This class of compounds has been
demonstrated to inhibit the GTPase hydrolysis activity of S. aureus FtsZ at a low micromolar IC50 value with moderate antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and Escherichia coli. Compound 7a also exhibited a strong synergistic effect
against various MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus
faecium strains when combined with clinically used
β-lactam antibiotics.34 However,
the structural complexity of the chiral quinuclidine scaffold and
limited compound availability from commercial sources have prevented
further development. In the present study, we report a design and
efficient synthesis of a novel amine-linked 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyrimidine
compound library with the aims of simplifying the complex quinuclidine
scaffold with simple amines and improving their antimicrobial activity.
A promising compound exhibiting potent antimicrobial activity has
been selected for further investigation regarding its interaction
with the S. aureus FtsZ protein. Because
of its structural novelty, potent antimicrobial activity, and high
selectivity against S. aureus, a new
series of such compounds may represent a promising starting point
for further investigation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Compound Library Design and Synthesis
Molecular docking
study of compound 7 and GTP molecules
using S. aureus FtsZ revealed that
the 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyrimidine moiety of 7 occupied
exactly the same binding pocket as the guanosine moiety of GTP molecules
through an extensive network of hydrogen bonds with the FtsZ protein,
suggesting that the pyrimidine moiety is crucial for binding.33 Therefore, our molecular design strategy is
to retain the pyrimidine moiety and replace the chiral quinuclidine
moiety at position 4 with various substituted amine moieties, which
offer desirable compound flexibility and physicochemical property.35 At the same time, various substituents will
be installed at positions 2 and 6. As there was no structural information
to guide the compound design, compound 7 was therefore
divided into two parts (pyrimidine head and amine tail), as outlined
in Figure 1. A compound
library would then be designed and synthesized to sequentially interrogate
the pyrimidine head and the amine tail using convergent synthesis.
With the preliminary structure–activity relationship (SAR)
in hand, compounds combining the promising structural motifs would
then be synthesized by dedicated synthesis. On the basis of this approach,
eight pyrimidine heads (Scheme 1) and 39 secondary amine tails (Chart 1) were designed and synthesized. Cyclic amine
tails (for a seven-member homopiperazine ring, amine01–23, or for a six-member piperazine ring, amine24–34) and linear amine tails (amine35–39) were included
in this study for comparison purpose. A general synthesis route of
target compounds 14 is outlined in Scheme 1. The pyrimidine heads were easily obtained
by the coupling of various acid chlorides 8a–d with silyl group-protected terminal alkyne 9 in the
presence of triethylamine under Sonogashira conditions, followed by
the subsequent addition of excess amidinium hydrochloride salts 10v–z in one pot, allowing a straightforward access
to 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyrimidines 11 under mild conditions
and in good yields.36 It is worthy to note
that the use of unprotected terminal alkyne 9 should
be avoided because of the relatively low yield of product. Deprotection
of the silyl group of 11 by acidic treatment of concentrated
hydrochloric acid in methanol afforded alcohols 12 in
quantitative yield, which were further treated with triphenylphosphine
and carbon tetrabromide to furnish the bromides 13 in
high yield (two steps). It is also worthy to note that bromides 13 were found to be unstable at high temperatures (>50
°C)
or under prolonged exposure of weakly basic medium at room temperature,
affording the elimination product of 4-vinyl pyrimidine. It is recommended
that bromides 13 should be prepared freshly and used
immediately for the next step. The compound library of amine-linked
2,4,6-trisubstituted pyrimidines 14 was then constructed
by mixing the freshly prepared bromides 13 with various
amine derivatives amine01–39 (Chart 1) in acetonitrile (ACN) at room
temperature. By employing this approach, a small library of amine-linked
2,4,6-trisubstituted pyrimidines with 99 candidates was successfully
constructed for SAR study. Similarly, pyrimidines 14 with
a sulfonamide group were also synthesized for SAR study, and their
synthesis route is depicted in Scheme 2. Treatment of selected bromides 13ay and 13az with excess 1-Boc-homopiperazine afforded Boc-protected
pyrimidines 14 (14ay_amine40 and 14az_amine40), respectively, in high yield, which were further acidified with
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in dichloromethane (DCM) to furnish pyrimidines 14 (14ay_amine41 and 14az_amine41) with a secondary amino group. Pyrimidines 14 (14az_amine42–47) with a sulfonamide group were successfully
synthesized in good yield by treating various commercially available
sulfonyl chlorides with amine 14az_amine41.

2.2 Evaluation of Antimicrobial Activities, SAR,
and Cytotoxicity against Normal Cells
The compound library
of 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyrimidines 14 was then evaluated
simultaneously for (1) their antimicrobial activities against the
Gram-positive S. aureus strain ATCC
29213 and the Gram-negative E. coli strain ATCC 25922 by measuring their MIC, which is the lowest concentration
of a compound that prevents the visible growth of bacteria in a broth
dilution susceptibility test according to the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines,37 and (2) their cytotoxicity against normal mouse fibroblasts L929
by measuring their IC50, which is the concentration of
a compound that is required for 50% inhibition. Parent compounds 7a and 7b (Figure 1, bottom right) were selected as a positive control.
Their antimicrobial activities against both the bacterial strains
ranged from 24 to 64 μg/mL, demonstrating only moderate antibacterial
activity and poor selectivity of killing between the two bacterial
strains (Table 1, entries
1 and 2). By employing progressive MIC screening together with cytotoxicity
assay, we have successfully identified several compounds that displayed
superior antimicrobial activity and selectivity against S. aureus. The results of MIC screening and cytotoxicity
assay are summarized in Table 1, in which only compounds with MIC values against S. aureus 29213 less than 8 μg/mL are shown.
Compounds with MIC values higher than 8 μg/mL are shown in the Supporting Information (Table S1). In general,
among all newly synthesized derivatives, most of them displayed potent
inhibitory activities against the growth of S. aureus along with some extent of cytotoxicity against normal cells L929.
The low IC50 values of L929 indicate that the compounds
are very toxic and may have unselective interaction with protein targets
other than FtsZ, causing high cytotoxicity against normal cells. However,
all of them exhibited very weak inhibitory activities against the
growth of E. coli even at a concentration
of 64 μg/mL. Such a weak activity against E.
coli may be attributed to their poor penetration ability
into the cytoplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, which have an outer
membrane of low permeability. From the compounds listed in Table 1, seven compounds
displaying superior potency with MIC values at 3–4 μg/mL
were identified, namely, 14dv_amine16, 14dv_amine06, 14dv_amine20, 14dv_amine07, 14dv_amine08, 14av_amine16, and 14av_amine20 (Table 1, entries 3–9).
Compared with compound 7b, their potencies were dramatically
improved by 16–21-fold. Interestingly, these compounds possess
the common structural features of a 4-pyridyl (4-Py) group at position
2 and a cyclic seven-member homopiperazine ring substituted with a
benzyl group at position 4. Detailed SAR analysis of 2,4,6-trisubstituted
pyrimidine 14 derivatives is depicted in Figure 2. For the pyrimidine head,
the 4-Py group of R2 of 14av_amine16 was very
important for potent antibacterial activity. Replacing this functional
group with others such as 3-pyridyl of 14ay_amine16,
2-pyridyl of 14az_amine16, phenyl of 14ax_amine16, and methyl groups of 14aw_amine16 resulted in a weak
antibacterial activity, implying that the nitrogen atom of the 4-Py
group is crucial for maintaining potent antibacterial activity. For
R1 group of the pyrimidine head, both the phenyl of 14dv_amine16 and the 3-pentyl group of 14av_amine16 were favorable substituents. The less bulky isopropyl group of 14bv_amine16 and the linear n-pentyl group
of 14cv_amine16 both caused poor antibacterial activity.
In general, pyrimidine head bearing 4-Py group of R2 and
phenyl or 3-pentyl groups of R1 exhibited the most potent
antibacterial activity. For SAR analysis of the amine tail (14av_amine01–14av_amine39), there were two important
structural features that gave rise to potent antibacterial activity:
(1) the cyclic seven-member homopiperazine ring with a substituted
benzyl group and (2) the benzyl group substituted with a bulky group
(tert-butyl of 14av_amine07, trifluoromethyl
of 14av_amine16, isopropyl of 14av_amine06, and bromo of 14av_amine08) at the para position, but
not at the meta or ortho position, of 14av_amine17–18. Replacing the amine tail with a cyclic six-member piperazine ring
of 14av_amine24, linear 1,2-diamine of 14av_amine35–36, or 1,3-diamine of 14av_amine37–38 resulted
in a poor antibacterial activity. It is also worthy to note that replacing
the benzylic carbon with a rigid functional group, such as carbonyl
group of 14av_amine19, sulfonyl group of 14az_amine43–44, or α,β-unsaturated ketone group of 14av_amine21–23, caused a poor antibacterial activity. These results suggested that
a more flexible and freely rotatable functional group should be installed
at this position. This observation was further supported by the low
MIC value of compound 14av_amine20, in which the benzylic
carbon was replaced with a freely rotatable CH2CH2 group.

Encouraged
by these promising results, three compounds, namely, 14av_amine16, 14dv_amine16, and 14dv_amine06, were
further selected to test against nine clinically isolated
bacterial strains including S. aureus ATCC 29247, which is an ampicillin-resistant strain, S. aureus ATCC BAA-41, ATCC BAA-1717, ATCC BAA-1720,
and ATCC 43300 which are methicillin-resistant strains, and four USA300
strains (#417, #757, #1799, and #2690), which are the predominant
strain type of community-associated MRSA in the United States. PC19072338 and compound 5(29) were also synthesized according the literature for a positive
control. The MIC screening results are summarized in Table 2. All compounds were found to
retain potent antibacterial activities against these antibiotic-resistant
strains with MIC values ranging from 1 to 6 μg/mL. Compounds 14av_amine16, 14dv_amine16, and 14dv_amine06 displayed a potent antibacterial activity against MRSA, with MIC
values of 3–6 μg/mL, which are very close to those of
reported FtsZ inhibitors (5 and PC190723). Compared with
methicillin, which is the clinically used antibiotic with MIC values
higher than 64 μg/mL against most of the MRSA, these pyrimidine
derivatives exhibited significantly lower MIC values and thus exhibited
the potential to be developed into new antistaphylococcal agents in
the future. It is worthy to mention that compound 7 did
not exhibit any antibacterial activity against these clinically isolated S. aureus strains (MIC > 48 μg/mL).

2.3 Investigation
of the Potential for the Development
of Resistance and in Vivo Biological Evaluation
A crucial
attribute of potential antimicrobial agents is that the spontaneous
development of drug resistance is not easily attained. To evaluate
the spontaneous resistance rate of these compounds in MRSA, compound 14av_amine16 was selected for the study against the MRSA strain
ATCC 43300. We plated 1 × 109 cells on agar plates
containing 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or 8× the MIC of compound 14av_amine16 and observed the degree of bacterial growth.
As shown in Figure 3A (left), almost confluent bacterial growth was observed for the
DMSO-treated bacterial cells, yet no colony was observed for the plates
treated with compound 14av_amine16 (Figure 3A, right) after 48 h incubation,
implying that the rate of emergence of spontaneous resistant mutants
was as low as <1 × 109. This low frequency of spontaneous
resistance implies a reduced probability of rapid development of resistance
against compound 14av_amine16 in clinical practice.

ATCC 43300 inoculation. Larvae were considered dead if they did not
respond to physical stimuli. Data presented are the mean of three
independent experiments.

As a preliminary measure of in vivo toxicity and efficacy,
we next
tested our lead compound 14av_amine16 in a Galleria mellonella model, which is an easy and inexpensive
in vivo model with no ethical constraints for investigating the antibacterial
activity of a compound.39 To examine the
feasibility of using G. mellonella for
compound 14av_amine16 toxicity study, we examined the
ability of compound 14av_amine16 to kill G. mellonella larvae. Various concentrations of compound 14av_amine16 dissolved in 50% poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
in saline (0, 50, and 100 mg/kg) were injected into the hemocoel of
last-instar G. mellonella larvae, and
survival was scored over time. All concentrations of compound 14av_amine16 tested did not kill the G. mellonella larvae during a 48 h period (Figure 3B). These data indicate that the formulation of 50%
PEG in saline and compound 14av_amine16 are nontoxic
and safe against G. mellonella larvae.
Next, we investigated the efficacy of compound 14av_amine16 against G. mellonella larvae infected
with MRSA ATCC 43300 (Figure 3C). Inoculation of lethal dose of 2.5 × 106 CFU/larva of MRSA ATCC 43300 led to a significant death rate. All
larvae injected with 50% PEG in saline (0 mg/kg) died within a 24
h infection period. Injection of compound 14av_amine16 at a dose of 50 mg/kg to the infected larvae was found to prolong
the survival time of the infected larvae to 36 h. Encouragingly, we
observed 20% survival rate of the infected larvae over the infection
period with increased dosage with this agent at 100 mg/kg. Compared
to the vehicle group, it was found to be highly significant (p < 0.05). Further increased dosage did not lead to improved
efficacy (data not shown). These data indicated that compound 14av_amine16 is capable of preventing or delaying the lethal
effect of MRSA ATCC 43300 in G. mellonella larvae. This suggests that compound 14av_amine16 has
strong potential for animal studies in future.

2.4 Saturation
Transfer Difference NMR Study
Saturation transfer difference
(STD) NMR spectroscopy is a powerful
and unique tool that can detect the magnetization that was transferred
from a protein to a bound ligand proton. It is commonly used to detect
the interaction between low-molecular-weight compounds and large biomolecules.40 To get further insights into the interaction
between compound 14av_amine16 and S. aureus FtsZ protein, STD NMR spectroscopy was employed to characterize
the binding properties and identify the epitopes of small molecules
that interact with a protein receptor. S. aureus FtsZ protein was expressed and purified as described in a previous
report.29 STD NMR spectroscopy was performed,
and the relative degrees of saturation for individual protons of compound 14av_amine16 are displayed in Figure 4, with the integral value of the largest
signal set to 100%. The line boarding observed was caused by compound 14av_amine16 being in close contact with the FtsZ protein,
resulting in slow tumbling rate of the protein–ligand complex,
which also confirmed that compound 14av_amine16 indeed
binds to FtsZ protein. All of the protons of compound 14av_amine16 showed some degree of enhancement, demonstrating that the molecule,
except the homopiperazine moiety, is bound to the FtsZ protein. The
largest amount of saturation transfer was observed for H1, indicating
that the pyrimidine ring of compound 14av_amine16 is
making more intimate contacts with the FtsZ protein.

Figure 4 STD effect measured for
compound 14av_amine16 binding
to S. aureus FtsZ protein. Chemical
structure and proton assignments of compound 14av_amine16 (upper panel); 1D (STD-off) spectrum displayed in blue with signal
assignment (middle panel); and STD spectrum displayed in red (lower
panel), and STD effects (ISTD/I0) for each proton are reported.

2.5 S. aureus FtsZ
Polymerization and GTPase Hydrolysis Assay
Next, we sought
to determine whether the binding of compound 14av_amine16 to S. aureus FtsZ protein led to
a change in the polymerization activity and GTPase activity of the
protein itself. To assay the polymerization activity, an in vitro
light scattering assay, in which FtsZ polymerization was detected
in solution by a time-dependent increase in light scattering as reflected
by an increase in solution absorbance at 600 nm, was employed. Figure 5 shows the relative
time-dependent absorbance at 600 nm of S. aureus FtsZ in the presence of compound 14av_amine16 at concentrations
ranging from 0 to 30 μM. It was clearly demonstrated that compound 14av_amine16 potently suppressed the self-polymerization of S. aureus FtsZ protein, with the magnitude of these
suppressing effects increasing with increasing compound concentration.
Compared with the vehicle (1% DMSO), complete inhibition of FtsZ polymerization
was observed at 30 μM of compound 14av_amine16.
In addition, we also investigated the inhibitory effect of compound 14av_amine16 on GTPase hydrolysis activity according to the
protocol described previously.33 Compounds 7a and 7b inhibited the GTPase hydrolysis activity
with IC50 values at 73 and 189 μM, respectively.
However, compound 14av_amine16 at 50 and 75 μM
displayed only moderate inhibition of the GTPase hydrolysis activity
at about 20 ± 3% and 25 ± 4%, respectively. GTPase hydrolysis
activity at higher compound concentrations (>80 μM) cannot
be
measured because of the poor compound solubility, which causes precipitation
in aqueous medium. Nonetheless, it seems very likely that compound 14av_amine16 suppresses the self-polymerization of the FtsZ
protein, probably via disrupting the GTPase hydrolysis activity of
the FtsZ protein.

concentrations

The experiments were performed in triplicate, with the symbols indicating
the mean value (N = 3).

2.6 Effects on the Bacillus subtilis 168 Cell Morphology and Localization of the Z-Ring
The
underlying mode of action of the antibacterial activity of compound 14av_amine16 was further investigated by the microscopic observation
of a rod-shaped B. subtilis 168 cell
morphology. Compound 14av_amine16 exhibited antibacterial
activity against B. subtilis 168 with
an MIC value at 12 μM. Treatment of B. subtilis cells at a sublethal concentration of compound 14av_amine16 significantly increased the cell length with average cell length
> 20 μm (Figure 6B) as compared with the DMSO-treated cells (cell length <
5 μm, Figure 6A). Interestingly,
such a phenomenon of cell elongation was also observed for other FtsZ
inhibitors reported, strongly suggesting that 14av_amine16 interacts with the FtsZ protein in vivo. The iconic filamentous
cell phenotype of FtsZ inhibitors was believed to be caused by the
disruption and mislocalization of the Z-ring. To further confirm that,
a fluorescence microscopic analysis of dynamic Z-ring formation in B. subtilis 168 was carried out by using a functional
green fluorescent protein-tagged FtsZ in B. subtilis 168. In the absence of compound (DMSO-treated), fluorescent foci
corresponding to the Z-ring formation were observed at the mid cell.
Each cell possesses only one fluorescent focus, indicating the proper
Z-ring formation and localization (Figure 6C, red arrow). By contrast, upon exposure
to compound 14av_amine16, the bacteria cell lacked mid-cell
foci. Instead, the FtsZ protein was randomly distributed as multiple
discrete foci (Figure 6E, red arrows) throughout the whole elongated cell, demonstrating
that compound 14av_amine16 caused obvious mislocalization
of the Z-ring.

3 Conclusions
In this study, a total
of 99 amine-linked 2,4,6-trisubstituted
pyrimidines, many displaying potent antistaphylococcal activity and
some extent of cytotoxicity against normal cells, has been synthesized
systematically by varying the substitutions in 2, 4, and 6 positions.
These compounds also exhibited potent antibacterial activities against
clinically isolated MRSA strains. These promising results led to the
efficacy testing of the lead compound 14av_amine16, which
revealed a very low spontaneous FOR and limited toxicity against G. mellonella larvae. Investigation of the mode of
action suggests that compound 14av_amine16 exerted its
antibacterial activity by interacting with S. aureus FtsZ protein and suppressing its polymerization, resulting in obvious
mislocalization of the Z-ring formation. In summary, these newly synthesized
2,4,6-trisubstituted pyrimidine derivatives represent a novel scaffold
of FtsZ inhibitors.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemical Synthesis
All NMR and mass
spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-III spectrometer and a Micromass
Q-TOF-2 spectrometer by the electrospray ionization (ESI) mode, respectively.
STD NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance III 600 NMR
spectrometer equipped with a QCI cryoprobe at 298 K. All reagents
and solvents were of reagent grade and were used without further purification
unless otherwise stated. The thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates
(silica gel 60F254, 0.25 mm thickness) were purchased from
E. Merck. Flash column chromatographic purifications were performed
on MN silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh). Compound purity was determined
by an Agilent 1100 series high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
system installed with a Prep-Sil scalar column (4.6 mm × 250
mm, 5 μm) at an UV detection of 254 nm (reference at 450 nm).
All tested compounds were shown to have >95% purity according to
HPLC. Amine20 was prepared from homopiperazine and 1-(2-bromoethyl)-4-trifluoromethylbenzene. Amine38 was prepared from N,N-diethyl-1,3-diaminopropane and 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl bromide.
Other amines used in this study are commercially available.

procedure in accordance with the CLSI guidelines37 and our previous reports.29,44

4.7 Cytotoxicity (IC50) Assay toward
the L929 Cell Line
Standard MTS assay was performed to determine
the cytotoxicity of all compounds toward the L929 cells. Briefly,
10 000 cells were mixed with compounds at different concentrations
in a final volume of 100 μL in each well of a 96-well plate,
followed by 3 days incubation at 37 °C. DMSO at 1% was used as
a solvent control. The half-maximal inhibition of the compounds was
determined using a CellTiter 96 AQueous assay (Promega). An aliquot
of the freshly prepared MTS/phenazine methosulfate mixture at a ratio
of 20:1 was added into each well, followed by 2 h incubation at 37
°C. Optical absorbance at 490 nm was measured with a microplate
reader. The IC50 values were determined from the dose–response
curves of the MTS assay (Prism 4.0). All experiments were performed
in triplicates, and the results will be presented as the average of
the three independent measurements.

4.12 Evaluation of Toxicity and Antimicrobial
Efficacy Using a G. mellonella Model

All larvae were incubated at 37 °C, and the mortality rates were
assessed at 12 h interval for 48 h after different treatments. All
larvae were scored as dead if they showed no signs of movement to
physical stimuli. All injections were carried out into the last left
proleg of the larvae using a 10 μL Hamilton syringe. For toxicity
evaluation, the larvae were injected with 0 (vehicle), 50, and 100
mg/kg compound 14av_amine16 only. For antimicrobial efficacy,
the larvae were inoculated with a lethal dose of 10 μL of S. aureus 43300 (2.5 × 106 CFU).
All larvae received compound 14av_amine16 of different
dosages (0, 50, and 100 mg/kg) 1 h before bacterial inoculation. All
data were analyzed for statistical significance using a log rank and
χ squared test with 1° of freedom.
