Utilization
of molecular oxygen as an oxidizing agent in industrially
important reactions is the ultimate goal to design environmentally
benign processes under ambient conditions. However, the high thermal
stability and a large O–O dissociation barrier in O2 molecule pose a great challenge toward its successful application
in the oxidative chemistry. To achieve this goal, different catalysts
based on monometallic and bimetallic clusters have been developed
over the years to promote binding and dissociation of molecular oxygen.
The successful design of efficient metal cluster catalysis needs an
in-depth knowledge of synergistic effects between different metal
atoms and intrinsic catalytic mechanisms for O2 adsorption
and dissociation. Here, we present a systematic theoretical investigation
of reaction pathways for O2 adsorption and dissociation
on Au8, Pd8, and Au8–nPdn (n = 1–7)
nanoclusters in different spin states. The density functional calculations
point out that the O2 dissociation barriers can be significantly
reduced with the help of certain bimetallic clusters along specific
spin channels. Our results particularly indicate that Au5Pd3 and Au1Pd7 show very large O2 binding energies of 1.76 and 1.69 eV, respectively. The enhanced
O2 binding subsequently leads to low activation barriers
of 0.98 and 1.19 eV along the doublet and quartet spin channels, respectively,
without the involvement of any spin flip-over for O2 dissociation.
Furthermore, the computed O2 dissociation barriers are
significantly low as compared to the already reported barriers (1.95–3.65
eV) on monometallic and bimetallic Au–Ag clusters. The results
provide key mechanistic insights into the interaction and dissociation
of molecular oxygen with Au–Pd clusters, which can prove informative
for the design of efficient catalysts for oxidative chemistry involving
molecular oxygen as a reactant.

1 Introduction
Activation
and dissociation of molecular oxygen is one of the primary
and key steps for driving environmentally and industrially important
reactions such as CO oxidation, ethylene epoxidation, hydrocarbon
oxidation, and so on.1−14 Because of its triplet ground-state and strong oxygen–oxygen
bond, molecular oxygen is kinetically very stable under ambient conditions.
Owing to these challenges, a number of catalysts based on different
metal nanoclusters15−28 have been explored toward activation and dissociation of molecular
oxygen for its successful utilization in oxidative chemistry. Among
the various nanoclusters, gold-based nanoclusters have been at the
forefront of both experimental and theoretical research for understanding
the intrinsic mechanistic pathways of O2 activation and
dissociation on metal nanoclusters.

Early experimental investigations
were carried out by the research
groups of Kaldor29,30 and Whettan31 on O2 adsorption on a series of anionic gold
nanoclusters. The authors found that O2 exhibits profound
adsorption with even sized anionic clusters and O2 reactivity
strongly depends on the cluster size and charge. Subsequently, Wallace
et al.32,33 performed detailed experimental studies
to discern the role of CO and OH coadsorption on the reactivity of
molecular oxygen with small gold clusters. Huang et al.34 using combined experimental and theoretical
methods further demonstrated molecular chemisorption and physisorption
of O2 on small sized anionic gold clusters with even and
odd number of atoms, respectively. Woodham et al.35 using infrared multiple photon dissociation spectra of
anionic O2–gold cluster complexes experimentally
provided direct evidence for the formation of a superoxo moiety upon
O2 complexation. Recent investigations by Zeng and co-workers36 unraveled that a superoxo to peroxo binding
transition of O2 molecule on anionic gold clusters occurs
at Au8–.

The above experimental
findings of O2 interaction with
gold clusters were explained by numerous theoretical studies. For
example, Mills et al.37 using density functional
theory (DFT) found that O2 binds more strongly with neutral
and anionic gold clusters having odd number of electrons. Landman
and co-workers38 suggested that small sized
anionic gold clusters (n = 1–3) prefer molecular
adsorption and large sized clusters (n = 4–8)
prefer dissociative adsorption. The authors also revealed that O2 dissociation entails very high barriers. Similar results
were found by Wang and Gong39 while investigating
O2 chemisorption on Au32 as a model system.
Jena et al.40 investigated the promotional
effect of hydrogen atom doping on the reactivity of Au8 cluster toward molecular oxygen. Zeng and Gao41 and Lyalin and Taketsugu42 in
two independent studies discerned the effect of water and ethylene
adsorption on the O2 activation and dissociation on small
sized gold clusters. Several other theoretical works were carried
out to examine the effect of factors such as charge state,43−46 doping,47−52 coadsorption,53,54 and support55−58 on O2 interactions
with gold clusters.

Although O2 adsorption and dissociation
are studied
comprehensively on monometallic gold clusters both experimentally
and theoretically, very few investigations are available wherein the
role of composition and spin state vis-a-vis O2 adsorption
and dissociation on bimetallic clusters, particularly on Au–Pd
clusters, has been elucidated thus far. Recently, García-Cruz
et al.59 studied the O2 adsorption
and dissociation on small bimetallic AumAgn clusters (m + n < 6). The authors concluded that the O2 binding
energies on the pure and bimetallic systems show a strong dependence
on the spin state of the cluster. Similarly, Joshi et al.60 revealed that Pt6 and AunPtm (n + m = 6) with a double-planar shape are catalytically
more efficient toward O–O bond activation.

Bimetallic
clusters hold a special position in the field of catalysis
as they possess strikingly distinct properties compared to the parent
metals, thereby acting as suitable candidates for design of superior
catalysts with enhanced stability, activity, and selectivity.61,62 Among the various bimetallic systems, the Au–Pd cluster catalysts
are known to display a promising efficiency for catalyzing a wide
range of oxidation reactions, namely, CO oxidation, direct synthesis
of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen, and selective oxidation
of alcohols to aldehydes.63−67 Despite their superior and promising catalytic behavior, a comprehensive
knowledge of the synergic effects between Au and Pd and the intrinsic
factors controlling the adsorption and dissociation of molecular oxygen
on these bimetallic systems are still elusive. Thus, an in-depth molecular-level
understanding of the factors controlling the O2 adsorption
and dissociation to produce atomic oxygen species on the bimetallic
Au–Pd clusters is highly imperative for their optimization
for the aforementioned oxidation reactions involving oxygen.

In this context, in the current work, DFT calculations were carried
out to systematically investigate the influence of spin state and
composition of Au–Pd bimetallic clusters on the adsorption
and dissociation of molecular oxygen. The calculations were performed
on selected ground-state conformations of monometallic Au8,/Pd8, and bimetallic Au88–nPdn (n = 1–7)
clusters according to the data available in the literature.

2 Computational Details
All the calculations were performed
by DFT using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE)68 functional as implemented in the
Gaussian 09 package.69 The coordinates
of the starting geometries for Au8, Pd8, and
Au–Pd clusters were taken from the available literature70 and fully optimized in the singlet/triplet and
doublet/quartet spin states depending on whether the cluster has even
or odd number of electrons. Geometry optimizations of the different
structures were carried out using the default convergence cutoff of
10–4 with the help of Berny algorithm. The LANL2DZ
basis set and the corresponding Los Alamos effective core potential
were used for gold and palladium atoms, respectively. For oxygen,
the TZVP basis set was used. The energetically most stable configurations
of O2 adsorbed complexes of Au8, Pd8, and Au–Pd clusters were found by adsorbing the O2 molecule both via atop/superoxo (with one metal–oxygen bond)
and bridged/peroxo (with two metal–oxygen bonds) modes on various
distinct sites in these clusters. The oxygen adsorption was studied
in two different spin states (singlet/triplet or doublet/quartet)
depending on the cluster. It is important to highlight here that O2 interaction and dissociation on closed shell metal clusters
may involve spin crossovers, and thus, computation of reaction pathways
for O2 dissociation quantitatively requires advanced wave-function-based
methods. However, because of computational restrictions, DFT in the
framework of PBE has been widely used to study the spin and structural
details of O2 adsorption and dissociation44,59,71,72 on monometallic and bimetallic clusters. Moreover, in a recent study,
Dononelli and Klüner72 showed that
the DFT/PBE and high-levelcoupled cluster singles, doubles, and triples
method results for the O2 and CO adsorption energies on
group 11 nanoclusters were in close agreement with each other. Vibrational
frequency calculations were carried out to guarantee that the optimized
structures are local minima. The O2 binding energies (Eb(O2)) were computed with the help
of the given equation  where EO2 is
the energy of the O2 molecule in the triplet
sate, EC is the energy of the cluster
in the lowest-energy spin state, and Ecomplex is the energy of the O2–cluster complexes in the
lowest-energy spin state. The transition states were located by the
linear synchronous transit method and were characterized by the presence
of single imaginary frequency corresponding to the O–O scission.

3 Results and Discussion
The geometries of the monometallic
(Au8 and Pd8) and bimetallic clusters (Au8–nPdn)
are shown in Figure 1. As reported earlier, Au8 has
a planar structure and prefers to be in the singlet spin state, whereas
the Pd8 cluster possesses a three-dimensional structure
with a triplet spin state. All the bimetallic clusters exhibit three-dimensional
structures. The bimetallic clusters Au7Pd1 and
Au6Pd2 with high percentage of Au atoms prefer
to be in the low spin singlet or doublet states as compared to the
triplet and quartet spin states. However, Au–Pd clusters with
three or more than three Pd atoms favor higher spin states of triplet
or quartet multiplicity depending on whether the cluster has even
or odd number of electrons. Thus, a spin transition is involved as
the composition of the clusters is varied with Pd, playing a dominant
role in deciding the overall spin state of the bimetallic clusters.

structures of the Au8, Pd8,
and Aun–1Pdn (n = 1–7) clusters and their corresponding
spin states.

We next look at the mode
of the O2 adsorption and binding
on the monometallic Au8 and Pd8 clusters. Figure 2 represents the equilibrium
structures of O2 adsorbed complexes of the Au8, Pd8, and Au8–nPdn clusters in their lowest-energy spin states.
The structures corresponding to the higher energy spin states and
their relative energies with respect to the lowest energy spin state
structures are given in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. It can be seen from Figure 2 that O2 adsorbs via atop or superoxo
mode of bonding on the pristine Au8 cluster with a single
Au–O bond in both singlet and triplet spin states. Among the
singlet and triplet spin states, the Au8–O2 complex in the triplet state has 1.06 eV lower energy than the singlet
state. The calculated O2 binding energy on Au8 in the triplet state was found to be 0.31 eV. Moreover, interestingly,
it was found that the Au8–O2 complex
in the singlet state has higher energy than the isolated Au8 cluster and O2 molecule. Thus, the binding of O2 molecule on Au8 cluster is not favored from a thermodynamic
point of view in the singlet spin state. No bridged or peroxo type
of bonding was seen for O2 adsorption on the Au8 cluster in both spin states. This is in line with the earlier reported
results of O2 adsorption on Au8 cluster.38,40,51,55

of Au8, Pd8, and Aun–1Pdn (n = 1–7)
clusters. The spin state of the system is given below each O2–cluster complex. All the geometrical parameters marked are
in angstroms.

In contrast to Au8, pristine Pd8 cluster
prefers a peroxo/bridged type of bonding with two Pd–O bonds
with O2 molecule both in the singlet and in the triplet
spin state. The triplet state of the Pd8–O2 complex is found to be 0.05 eV lower in energy than the singlet
state. The Pd8 cluster shows considerably higher O2 binding energies of 1.43 eV in the triplet state. To further
corroborate the enhanced O2 binding energy in the case
of the Pd8 cluster, we calculated the O–O bond lengths,
O–O stretching frequencies, and net natural bond order charges
on the O2 molecule in the lowest energy spin states of
Au8/Pd8–O2 complexes. The
abovementioned parameters are known to qualitatively describe the
interaction of the O2 molecule with metal nanoclusters.
It is well known that the O2 molecule acts as an electron
acceptor and interacts strongly with clusters which can donate electrons
easily into the antibonding orbitals of the O2 molecule.
This results in the increase in the O–O bond length and red
shift in the O–O stretching frequencies. As can be seen from Table 1, there is a notable
increase in the O–O bond length and decrease in the O–O
stretching frequency on the Pd8 cluster as compared to
the Au8 cluster. We further note a significant charge transfer
of −0.41 electrons from the Pd8 cluster to the O2 molecule as compared to the −0.05 electrons in the
case of Au8 cluster.

The lowest-energy structures
of the O2 adsorbed complexes
of Au–Pd bimetallic clusters are also presented in Figure 2. As can be seen,
O2 prefers a superoxo/atop mode of binding on Au–Pd
clusters such as Au7Pd, Au6Pd2, and
Au5Pd3 with a high percentage of Au atoms, whereas
peroxo/bridged mode of bonding is preferred by O2 on Au4Pd4, Au3Pd5, Au2Pd6, and Au1Pd7 clusters with more
than three Pd atoms. Thus, we note a superoxo to peroxo transition
in the bonding of oxygen molecule with respect to the composition
of the cluster. A similar type of superoxo to peroxo transition of
O2 binding on anionic gold clusters as a function of size
was revealed by Zeng and co-workers36 in
a recent study using photoelectron spectroscopy and DFT calculations.
Coming to the spin state, the O2-adsorbed complexes of
Au7Pd1, Au5Pd3, and Au1Pd7 clusters having odd number of electrons prefer
a doublet spin state, whereas the O2-adsorbed complexes
of Au6Pd2 and Au4Pd4 having
even number of electrons prefer to be in the triplet spin state. The
lowest-energy doublet and quartet states of O2–Au3Pd5 complexes were found to have an energy difference
of 0.02 eV, whereas the singlet and triplet spin states of O2–Au2Pd6 complexes were found to have
the same energy. The equilibrium structures of the O2-adsorbed
complexes of Au–Pd clusters in their high energy spin states
and their relative energies are given in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information. A careful analysis of
the energetics of the O2-adsorbed complexes reveals that
the energy difference between the triplet and singlet spin states
of even electron clusters and doublet and quartet spin states of odd
electron clusters decreases as the number of Pd atoms increase in
the cluster. This is particularly important as O2 adsorption
is known to involve a spin transition from singlet to triplet state
in the case of less reactive monometallic closed shell gold clusters.
Thus, incorporation of heteroatoms such as Pd in closed shell gold
clusters can be used to overcome the spin activation energy and thereby
leading to facile channels for O2 dissociation.

We
next calculated the O2 binding energies on the Au–Pd
clusters in the lowest energy spin states which are given in Table 1. O2 adsorbs
in atop mode on Au7Pd, Au6Pd2, and
Au5Pd3 clusters, with binding energy values
of 0.64, 0.61, and 1.76 eV, respectively. For clusters such as Au4Pd4, Au3Pd5, Au2Pd6, and Au1Pd7 where O2 adsorbs in a bridged manner, the calculated binding energies are
found to be 1.37, 1.26, 1.34, and 1.69 eV, respectively. Thus, importantly,
the binding energies of O2 with Au–Pd clusters are
seen to increase significantly with the increase in the Pd content
irrespective of whether the cluster is an odd or even electron one.
Thus, changing the composition by incorporating atomic species such
as Pd can be an efficient strategy to improve the binding and reactivity
of O2 with the known less reactive even electron gold clusters.
We further looked at the O–O stretching frequencies and net
negative charge on the O2 molecule on the O2–Au–Pd clusters in the atop mode as well as the bridged
mode. The calculated O–O stretching frequencies as given in Table 1 show a larger red
shift for O2 adsorption in bridged mode than in the atop
mode. The large red shift in the O–O stretching frequencies
in the case of bridged O2 adsorption is also supported
by a considerable charge transfer in to the antibonding orbitals of
O2 during O2–cluster interaction as compared
to the atop mode of O2 adsorption.

We finally investigated
the O2 dissociation pathways
in different spin states (singlet and triplet states for even electron
clusters and doublet and quartet spin states for odd electron clusters)
on the Au8, Pd8, and Au–Pd clusters.
The computed reaction energy profiles of O2 dissociation
on the Au8 and Pd8 clusters along with the reactants,
transition states, and products are given in Figure 3. The energies of the reactants, transition
states, and products in the reaction profiles are given with respect
to the energy of the cluster in the lowest energy spin state and oxygen
in the triplet spin state. As can be seen from the reaction profiles,
the singlet 1R → 1TS → 1P and triplet 3R → 3TS → 3P pathways of O2 dissociation on Au8 have very large activation barriers of 2.59 and 3.83 eV, respectively.
On the other hand, in the case of Pd8, the activation barriers
for the singlet and triplet O2 dissociation pathways are
2.03 and 1.56 eV, respectively. The product 3P is less
stable than the reactant 3R in the case of Au8 and thus O2 dissociation is more unlikely to occur on
Au8. Moreover, based on the energy analysis of the O2 dissociation pathway, it can be concluded that the process
starts with triplet 3Au8–O2 complex, passes through the singlet 1Au8–O2* transition state,
and ends with the triplet O–Au8–O product.
Thus, there are two spin crossover steps, one before the transition
state and the other after the transition state in the O2 dissociation process on the Au8 cluster. The transition
states corresponding to O2 dissociation on Au8 both in the singlet and triplet pathways connect the reactants with
the transition states as can be seen in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. For the Pd8 cluster, the O2 dissociation starts with the triplet 3Pd8–O2 complex, passes through
the triplet 3Pd8–O2* transition state, and ends with
the singlet O–Pd8–O product. Hence, only
a single spin crossover step after the transition state occurs in
the case of O2 dissociation on the Pd8 cluster.
The reaction profile diagrams for O2 dissociation on the
bimetallic clusters are presented in Figures 4 and 5. As can be
seen from the figures, the calculated activation barriers for O2 dissociation on the Au–Pd clusters range from 0.98
to 1.94 eV depending on the composition of the cluster and spin state
of the dissociation pathway. The activation barriers for O2 dissociation along certain specific spin channels on the Au–Pd
clusters are found to be very low as compared to the parent Au8 and Pd8 clusters. Among the bimetallic clusters,
Au4Pd4 shows high activation barriers of 1.94
and 1.86 eV for the singlet and triplet pathways, respectively. Importantly,
very low activation barriers of 0.98 and 1.19 eV are seen for O2 dissociation along the doublet and quartet spin channels
on Au5Pd3 and Au1Pd7 clusters.
It is important to mention that Au5Pd3 and Au1Pd7 were found to adsorb O2 strongly
with very large binding energies. Moreover, the obtained O2 dissociation barriers are significantly lower than the already reported
activation barriers (1.95–3.65 eV) on pure gold and bimetallic
Au–Ag clusters.59 The activation
barriers along the quartet and doublet O2 dissociation
pathways on these clusters were found to be 1.45 and 1.55 eV, respectively.
From the reaction profile diagrams of O2 dissociation on
Au5Pd3 and Au1Pd7, it
can be seen that the process starts with doublet 2Au5Pd3–O2 and quartet 4Au1Pd7–O2 complexes, passes
through doublet and quartet transition states, and ends with doublet
and quartet products, respectively, on these clusters. Thus, not only
do Au5Pd3 and Au1Pd7 clusters
reveal significantly low activation barriers for O2 dissociation
but also do not involve any spin crossing during the O2 dissociation. Further, the reaction energies for O2 dissociation
as presented in Table 2 are thermodynamically more favorable on the abovementioned clusters
than the other cases studied. The binding energy, activation barrier,
and reaction energy analysis of O2 dissociation on various
bimetallic clusters confirm that certain compositions can lead to
facile reaction pathways with no spin flipping involved during the
reaction coordinate. Thus, the current study highlights that the composition
of a binary cluster and spin state of the various species during a
reaction coordinate on metal clusters can play a pivotal role in deciding
the kinetic and thermodynamic feasibility of the reaction.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have carried out DFT-based calculations to investigate
the effect of composition and spin state of bimetallic Au–Pd
clusters on the O2 adsorption and dissociation. Our results
indicate that the O2 adsorption energy for both atop and
bridged mode of binding increases significantly with the increase
in the number of Pd atoms in the bimetallic clusters. Thus, the prominent
odd/even effect of O2 adsorption prevalent in pristine
metal clusters is seen to disappear in the bimetallic Au–Pd
clusters. Moreover, among the bimetallic Au–Pd clusters Au5Pd3 and Au1Pd7 are seen to
show very low activation barriers of 0.98 and 1.19 eV along the doublet
and quartet spin channels, respectively, without any spin flipping
for O2 dissociation. The considerably low activation barriers
for the above clusters are attributed to their significantly large
O2 adsorption energies. In addition to low activation barriers,
O–O bond rupture is found to be thermodynamically favorable
with negative reaction energies on Au5Pd3 and
Au1Pd7 clusters along the doublet and quartet
reaction pathways. The current theoretical study thus points out the
critical role of composition and spin state of a cluster to exploit
alternate and efficient ways of nanocatalyst design.
