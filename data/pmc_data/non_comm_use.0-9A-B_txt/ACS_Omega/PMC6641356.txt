Mn-doped maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) particles
were generated from a binary metal (Fe,Mn)-based metal–organic
framework (MOF) via thermal decomposition under air. The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy analysis revealed that the synthesis of Fe/Mn-MOF accompanied
the reduction of the metal ions. The existence of Mn ions in this
synthetic process leads to thermally stable maghemite particles under
air. A temperature-induced structural phase transition from γ-Fe2O3 to α-Fe2O3 was observed
through a mixed phase with another structure. Mn-doped γ-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3 exhibit
superparamagnetic behavior. The sample annealed at 600 °C showed
a mixed magnetic hysteresis loop indicating the existence of an intermediate
structural phase between γ-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3 during the phase conversion from FeMn-MOF. The
constructed Mn-doped iron oxides are active toward reducing nitric
oxide with NH3. The NO conversion is 97% over Mn-doped
γ-Fe2O3 calcined at 320 °C.

1 Introduction
Maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) is an Fe2O3 polymorph that consists of one-third of the tetrahedral
sites and two-thirds of the octahedral sites bearing Fe3+ cation.1 Nanosized γ-Fe2O3 is considered a promising material for many applications,
such as sensing, magnetic separation, in vivo medical imaging, drug
delivery, and hyperthermia due to its nontoxicity, biocompatibility,
chemical stability, and good magnetic property.2−4 In addition,
γ-Fe2O3 is a vanadium-free catalyst candidate
for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to remove harmful nitric oxide
gases.5,6 Thus, a variety of synthetic processes for
the preparation of γ-Fe2O3 have been reported.
However, most of the synthetic methods required complicated procedures,
many additives, and an inert atmosphere.7−9 Moreover, this material
has always suffered from innate thermal unstability.1 Thus, developing a novel and facile method to synthesize
thermally stable γ-Fe2O3 as an effective
material should be designed and is required. Metal oxide generation
derived from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) (also called coordination
polymer) is a prominent method for a variety of applications owing
to the easy preparation, tuning functionalities, and morphology modulation
of MOFs.10−13 Thermal conversion from MOFs as precursors is influenced by the
metal species, physical properties of the MOF scaffolds, temperature,
atmospheric state, and physical environment.14−19 Despite the progress achieved to date, an understanding of the mechanisms
or factors in forming the required crystal structure by thermal decomposition
from MOFs is in the early stages of development. To obtain the desired
nanomaterials, understanding the thermal transformation mechanism
derived from MOFs precursors is necessary.

Even though several
methods have been reported for the γ-Fe2O3 preparation via thermal decomposition from MOFs,
they required oxygen-free atmosphere or reduction processes.20,21 It is previously reported that doping Mn(III) into the γ-Fe2O3 structure suppresses the thermal conversion
from the γ-Fe2O3 to the α-Fe2O3 phase.22 With this
knowledge, we expected that γ-Fe2O3 can
be prepared from bimetallic MOFs bearing iron and manganese under
suitable synthetic conditions. In this study, we successfully prepared
Mn-doped γ-Fe2O3 particles via thermal
decomposition under air from an MOF containing Fe and Mn species.
Interestingly, the reduction of the metal elements is observed from
bimetallic MOF but cannot be monitored from MOFs with a single metal
species. A thermal phase transformation from maghemite was also investigated.
The structural and magnetic properties of the generated iron oxides
were analyzed. In addition, the SCR catalytic activity of Mn-doped
iron oxides was tested and linked to their structural transformation.

2 Results and Discussion
The overall process for the
preparation of Mn-doped γ-Fe2O3 and their
phase transition are displayed in Scheme 1. First, bimetallic
FeMn-MOF particles (MOF) were synthesized using FeCl3·6H2O, MnCl2·4H2O, and sodium fumarate
as precursors. Prepared FeMn-MOF was characterized by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), IR spectroscopy,
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) element analysis, and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA).

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of the Preparation of Bimetallic
FeMn-MOF
and Their Thermal Conversion to the Mn-Doped Maghemite and Hematite
The IR spectrum of the bimetallic
FeMn-MOF shows a shift in the
CO stretching frequency from 1548 to 1568 cm–1 for
the free carboxylate of organic ligand to 1592 and 1698 cm–1, indicating the coordination of ligand to iron and manganese ions
(Figure S1). The IR patterns of the FeMn-MOF
were entirely similar to those of the synthesized Fe-MIL-88A particles.

As shown in the SEM and TEM images of the prepared bimetallic MOF,
the particles exhibit a diamond shape with a length of approximately
200 nm (Figure 1).
An EDS analysis was conducted to confirm the existence of both Fe
and Mn elements in the synthesized particles (Figure 1). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted
for the FeMn-MOF under air. The removal of the water below 100 °C
and the complete thermal decomposition of organic building blocks
above 440 °C via a two-step process were observed from the TGA
curve for FeMn-MOF (Figure S2).

(b) TEM images of FeMn-MOF particles. (c) The scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-EDS maps displaying the distribution
of Fe, Mn, and O of FeMn-MOF.

Manganese-doped maghemite (γ-Fe2O3)
particles were produced through the calcination under air at 320 °C
for 1 h using a furnace. The conversion of FeMn-MOF to Mn-doped γ-Fe2O3 particles during this process was confirmed
by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, SEM, high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM), EDS mapping, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses.
The XRD patterns of these aged FeMn-MOF under air at 320 and 400 °C
for 1 h contain the (220) and (311) peaks, which synchronized well
with the structure of the γ-Fe2O3 crystals
(International Centre for Diffraction Data, ICDD No. 00-025-1402)
(Figure 2).

Figure 2 Powder X-ray
diffraction patterns of Mn-doped iron oxides annealed
at 320, 400, 600, and 800 °C.

To investigate the thermal stability and phase transition
of Mn-doped
γ-Fe2O3, FeMn bimetallic MOFs were calcined
at increased temperatures. The calcination of FeMn-MOF was conducted
at 600 and 800 °C for 1 h. The XRD patterns show sharp diffraction
peaks for (104) and (110) at 2θ = 33.18 and 35.3°, which
agree with the rhombohedral structured α-Fe2O3. It is known that γ-Fe2O3 is
a thermally unstable structure among iron oxide polymorphs. These
results show that the Mn-doped γ-Fe2O3 system is quite thermally durable because Mn(III) suppresses the
transition from the γ-phase to the α-phase, which requires
higher energy. When FeMn-MOF was thermally treated at 400 and 600
°C, FeMn-400 displays the peak at 2θ = 32.8° and FeMn-600
shows the peak at 2θ = 55.1°, which are considered as a
ε-Fe2O3 structure (ICDD No. 00-016-0653).
Additionally, the shoulder near the peak (104) in FeMn-600 was observed,
which disappeared in FeMn-800. It is postulated that a thermally induced
phase transition from FeMn-320 (γ-Fe2O3) to FeMn-800 (α-Fe2O3) was formed via
an intermediate phase.

Figure S3 displays
the HRTEM images
of the samples aged at different temperatures. It is obvious that
the increased calcination temperature induced the morphological changes.
The morphology of the γ-Fe2O3 particles
from FeMn-MOF shows an irregular shape.  From the TEM images
of prepared iron oxides via calcination, the aggregation of particles
was observed, the length of irregularly shaped particles was increased,
and they became interconnected, as the calcination temperature increased
under air. This process contains thermal oxidation of the organic
blocks and the agglomeration of metal oxide particles. An EDS mapping
analysis using STEM was conducted to identify the presence of both
Fe and Mn elements in the prepared Mn-doped iron oxides samples (Figure S4). The Mn mapping is detected throughout
all of the particles, and the Fe mapping is consistently overlapped
in all of the iron oxide particles generated at different temperatures.
The EDS mapping images prove that manganese is well dispersed in the
iron oxide particles retaining the maghemite or hematite structure.

Using Scherrer’s equation from the (311) peaks at 2θ
= 35.6°, the average crystalline size of the FeMn-320 and -400
are 10.38 and 10.9 nm, respectively. The average crystalline size
of FeMn-600 and -800 calculated with the Scherrer’s equation
are 39 and 57 nm. The particle size of FeMn-600 and -800 are larger
than the calculated crystalline size because the particles may consist
of several different crystals.

The surface area of the newly
prepared Mn-doped iron oxides particles
was measured by the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET). The
generated Mn-doped (γ-Fe2O3) shows surface
area of 62.0993 m2/g, whereas increasing the calcination
temperature reduced the surface area to 45.1486, 15.8991, and 4.0526
m2/g. The N2 adsorption/desorption curve pattern
of all of the samples is similar (Figure S5). The low surface area can be explained by the increasing calcination
temperature inducing the agglomeration of Mn-doped iron oxide particles.

To identify the chemical state and binding energy of iron and manganese
of the prepared MnFe-MOF and aged Mn-doped iron oxides, the XPS analysis
was carried out. Figure 3 displays that the peaks for FeMn-MOF for Fe 2p3/2 are
observed with the binding energy at approximately 709.01 and 710.7
eV. The binding energy at 709.01 eV designate to Fe(II) cation and
the peak at 710.7 eV is the fingerprint of Fe(III) species (Table S1).23 The XPS
spectra of Fe 2p3/2 for the Fe-MIL-88A containing only
iron show that Fe(III) species at 710.98 and the satellite peak at
717.04 eV were dominant rather than the peak at 709.64 eV of Fe(II).
In addition, the XPS analysis was conducted after the calcination
of FeMn-MOF at 320, 400, 600, and 800 °C. The XPS spectra for
all of the samples show similar patterns. The appearance of Fe 2p3/2 peaks at 709.69 and 710.83 eV of FeMn-320 represents the
coexistence of Fe(II) and Fe(III) cation. The intensity of Fe(III)
peak increased and the binding energy of Fe 2p3/2 shifted
to be higher as the heating temperature was increased.

Figure 3 XPS spectra of (a) Mn
2p for the Mn-MOF and FeMn-MOF; (b) Mn 2p
for the FeMn-320, 400, 600, and 800; (c) Fe 2p for the Fe-MIL-88A
and FeMn-MOF; and (d) Fe 2p for the calcined FeMn-MOF at 320, 400,
600, and 800 °C.

As shown in Figure 3, the Mn 2p spectra of FeMn-MOF are displayed. The Mn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks are shown at a binding energy
ranging
from 630 to 660 eV.

The asymmetric Mn 2p peaks indicate the
existence of mixed-valence
manganese. The peak at 640.47 eV is assigned to Mn(II) species and
the peak at 642.13 eV is characteristic of the Mn(III) cation, respectively.
The broad peak at 637.76 eV was also monitored, indicating the generation
of more reduced Mn species. The intensity of Mn(II) is found to be
slightly higher than that of Mn(III). The XPS analysis of the Mn MOF
is shown in Figure 3. The peak at 640.67 eV is a feature of Mn(II), whereas the peak
at 641.85 eV is characteristic of the Mn(III) species. After the pyrolysis
of FeMn-MOF at 320 °C, the XPS spectra for the binding energy
of relevant Mn species were generated. The Mn(II) of FeMn-320 can
be found in the peak at 640.76 and the peak at 641.84 eV is characterized
as the Mn(III) cation. There is also small broad peak at 639.80 eV.
As the calcination temperature increased, the binding energies of
Mn 2p3/2 peaks shifted to the higher energies and the intensity
of Mn(III) species became higher than Mn(II) species. These results
indicate that oxidation has occurred during the calcination process.
It is observed from the XPS quantitative analysis that the atomic
ratio of Fe/Mn as 6.8:3.2 (FeMn-320), 6.1:3.9 (FeMn-400), 6.6:3.4
(FeMn-600), and 5.8:4.2 (FeMn-800).

In addition, these results
suggest that a redox reaction occurred
in this bimetallic synthetic system. It is known that the γ-Fe2O3 structure is not only generated starting from
magnetite (Fe3O4) spinel formation, which consisted
of Fe2+ and Fe3+, but is also in a thermally
unstable crystal phase.10,11 It is also reported
that the calcination of iron-containing MOFs under air generated the
hematite structure (α-Fe2O3) even under
400 °C.16 Thus, the mechanism for
the γ-Fe2O3 structure formation via thermal
decomposition from bimetallic MOFs is related to the existence of
manganese in this synthetic system, and Mn3+ ions provide
thermal stability to the γ-Fe2O3 structure.

The magnetic properties of the prepared manganese-doped iron oxides
were investigated using vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at room
temperature. Figures 4 and 5 depict the plots of the magnetization
versus the applied magnetic field for the Mn-doped Fe2O3 derived from FeMn-MOF via thermal treatment. The FeMn-320
exhibited superparamagnetic behavior showing the magnetization value
of 36.24 emu/g. It is a similar magnetization value compared with
manganese-doped γ-Fe2O3.22 The magnetization of FeMn-400 was 57.143 emu/g. Although
the mixed crystal structures were observed by XRD analysis, the magnetization
of FeMn-400 increased above the magnetization of FeMn-320 exhibiting
a superparamagnetic pattern. The magnetization of FeMn-320 and -400
are much less than that of the bulk γ-Fe2O3 materials (73–74 emu/g).24 The
M–H curve after calcination of FeMn-MOF at 600 °C illustrates
that the sample exhibits a ferromagnetic and paramagnetic mixed hysteresis
loop, with a coercivity of Hc = 284.88
Oe. The magnetization value is 1.22 to −0.95 emu/g. The decreased
magnetization of FeMn-600 can be explained by the thermal phase transformation
from γ-Fe2O3 to α-Fe2O3. The magnetization curve of FeMn-800 displays a very
weak ferromagnetic behavior, showing a coercivity of 88.84 Oe. The
magnetization value is approximately 3.152 emu/g, which is approximately
three times higher than that of bulk α-Fe2O3 (0.3 emu/g).

°C, (c)
400 °C, (d) 600 °C, and (e) 800 °C from FeMn-MOF.

Figure 5 NOx conversion efficiency of FeMn-320, 400,
600, and 800 under
the conditions of 400 ppm of NO and NH3, 3% O2, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) is 30 000 h–1 and balance gas is N2.

Although the bulk α-Fe2O3 is
antiferromagnetic,
it is reported that manganese doping enhances the magnetization value
of the α-Fe2O3.25

It is suggested from the magnetic properties that FeMn-600
is the
intermediate state, whereas the γ-Fe2O3 phase is transformed into the α-Fe2O3 phase.

Because maghemite is a promising candidate as an SCR
catalyst,
the catalytic activity of the Mn-doped iron oxides having γ-Fe2O3 (FeMn-320, 400) or α-Fe2O3 (FeMn-600, 800) structures in the SCR of NO with NH3 was studied.

The NOx conversion over FeMn-320 increased as
the reaction temperature
increased, and 97% NOx removal was achieved at 250 °C. The NOx
conversion in a temperature range from 150 to 300 °C was observed
to be over 80%. The maximum NOx conversion of FeMn-400 was 93% at
250 °C. The entire conversion efficiency of NOx sharply declined.
The maximum NOx conversion of FeMn-600 and FeMn-800 was 93 and 86%,
respectively, at 250 °C. The drastic decrease of catalytic activity
after pyrolysis above 600 °C can be attributed to the phase transition
from γ-Fe2O3 to α-Fe2O3. It is reported that the γ-phase of iron oxide
exhibited a higher SCR catalytic activity than the α-phase.6 Furthermore, the surface area of the Mn-doped
iron oxide samples diminished with increased calcination temperature,
causing a lower catalytic activity of NO removal.

3 Conclusions
To sum up, we have developed a facile method
to generate Mn-doped
γ-Fe2O3, and the thermal phase transformation
to α-Fe2O3 was observed via thermal decomposition
from bimetallic FeMn-MOF. It is postulated that introducing Mn(II)
ions induces the redox reactions during the synthesis of FeMn-MOF,
which are not observed with single metal species, and are responsible
for the formation of γ-Fe2O3 via thermal
conversion from FeMn-MOF. Even though γ-Fe2O3 is a thermodynamically unstable structure, the conversion
from Mn-doped γ-Fe2O3 to Mn-doped α-Fe2O3 requires a high activation energy because Mn
ions suppress the transition. FeMn-320 and -400 display superparamagnetic
behavior at room temperature, which is an inherent characteristic
of the Mn-doped γ-Fe2O3 structure. FeMn-800
shows a very weak ferromagnetic behavior with a drastically decreased
magnetization value indicating that a thermal phase transition to
Mn-doped α-Fe2O3 occurred. Interestingly,
the mixed ferromagnetic and paramagnetic behavior was observed from
FeMn-600 despite the transformation to the α-Fe2O3 structure, suggesting the existence of an electronic phase
intermediate. The SCR catalytic activity of NO with NH3 of all Mn-doped Fe2O3 was measured. When the
γ-Fe2O3 structure was formed, a good catalytic
activity with a 97% NO conversion rate at 250 °C at GHSV 30 000
h–1 was presented. The thermal crystalline structure
transformation to α-Fe2O3 resulted in
a decreased catalytic activity.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials and Instrument
All of the
chemicals obtained from commercial resources were used without further
purification. Fe-MIL-88A particles were synthesized with modification
according to a method previously reported.17 The morphology of the synthesized materials was investigated using
a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss SUPRA 55VP)
operated at an accelerating voltage of 3.0 kV and equipped with energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) capabilities. All of the scanning and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (STEM and HRTEM, respectively) images
and electron diffraction patterns were obtained using JEOL JEM-2000EXII
and JEM-ARM200F instruments operated at 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction
studies of the crystal structure were conducted using an XRD equipped
with a Cu Kα radiation source (50 kV, 100 mA, λ = 1.541
Å) at room temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was
carried out on a TA Instruments Q500 at up to 800 °C, with a
heating rate of 10 °C under air. The field-dependent magnetization
of each sample was measured ranging from −15 to 15 kOe using
a Lake Shore 7410 vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were acquired on a KRATOS AXIS with
Mg Kα X-rays as the excitation source (1253.6 eV). The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded at 77
K on a micrometrics 3flex surface characterization analyzer apparatus.
The specific surface area of the samples was calculated using the
multiple-point Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.

4.2 Preparation of Iron–Manganese Bimetallic
Metal–Organic Framework (FeMn-MOF), Fe-MIL-88A, and Mn MOF
FeCl3·6H2O (27 g, 100 mmol) and MnCl2·4H2O (19.7 g, 100 mmol) were dissolved in
400 mL of deionized water at 60 °C. Then, 100 mL of sodium fumarate
aqueous solution (32 g, 200 mmol) was added to the mixed solution
and, subsequently, precipitate was generated. The mixture was stirred
at 60 °C overnight and cooled to room temperature. The final
brown products were isolated by centrifugation and then washed with
deionized water and acetone twice. In addition, Fe-MIL-88A and Mn-MOF
were prepared via identical procedures using only one metal species
(200 mmol).

4.3 Phase Transition of Manganese-Doped
Iron Oxides
Bimetallic MOF was moved into a ceramic boat
and placed into a
furnace. The calcination process was performed at 320, 400, 600, and
800 °C for 1 h under air condition with a heating rate of 5 °C/min
and then quenched. Hereafter, the samples prepared by this method
are called FeMn-X, where X indicates
the calcination temperature.

4.4 Catalytic Performance Test
The catalytic
activities of the prepared iron oxides for the selected catalytic
reduction of NO with NH3 were carried out in a fixed-bed
reactor with an inner diameter of 10 mm. The reaction gas composed
of 400 ppm NO, 400 ppm NH3, and 3% O2 with N2 as the balance gas. The total flow rate was 1000 mL/min and
the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 30 000 h–1. The flow rate of all of the gases were controlled by mass flow
regulators. The outlet concentrations of NO and NO2 gas
were monitored using a Testo 350k analyzer.
