Activated carbon is widely used in
many fields because of its well-developed
pore structure. Especially in hemoperfusion, activated carbon beads
derived from macroporous resin spheres are the predominant adsorbents
in hemoditoxifiers. In comparison, biomass-activated carbon attracts
more extensive attention on account of its renewability and environmental
protection. In this study, a lotus root-type monolithic-activated
carbon with a hierarchical pore structure was made from rice husks
by the injection molding process followed by carbonization and activation.
The straight square channels with the side length of about 1.3 mm
were designable, and these channels with adjustable lengths were favorable
for the fluid flow during blood purification compared with the tightly
packed carbon beads in commercialized hemoditoxifiers. Complementally,
the hierarchical nano-sized pores in the walls of the big channels
would contribute much to the adsorption capacity for the monolith.
Specifically, the adsorption of vitamin B12, a representative of middle
molecular toxins in human blood, was about 3.7 mg g–1, which was acquired by simulated in vitro hemoperfusion tests and
this demonstrated the promising application of the lotus root-type
biomass-activated carbon in hemoperfusion.

Introduction
Activated carbon (AC) has attracted various
applications such as
energy storage,1 catalyst,2 adsorption,3 and medical facility4 (hemoditoxifier) because of its light weight,
hierarchical pore structure, and other unique properties. The raw
materials of AC derive from a wealth of sources, including coal tar
pitch, sludge, ore, sawdust, and biomass materials.5 By contrast, preparation of AC from renewable biomass materials
has been focused widely all the time because they are cheap, renewable,
and environment friendly with extensive sources. For example, the
coconut shell is a well-known precursor for the production of high-quality
granular AC, which has been applied as electrode materials in supercapacitors6 and adsorbents for textile dyes.7 Similarly, Gerçel et al.8 took AC, which was made from Euphorbia rigida, to remove dispersed dye from aqueous solution, and the maximum adsorption
capacity of Disperse Orange 25 was 118.93 mg g–1 at 20 °C. Aygün et al.9 prepared
granulated AC from several biomass materials (almond shells, hazelnut
shells, walnut shells and apricot stones) and investigated their adsorption
for phenol and methylene. Particularly, for Pb (II) and Cu (II) in
wastewater, powdery AC derived from cassava peels was proved to be
an efficient adsorbent on account of its well-developed microspores
(0.14 cc g–1) and high specific surface area (473
m2 g–1).10 In comparison, rice husks are another abundant biomass raw materials
for the production of AC. Because of the high ash content (20%),11 most of which is silica, rice husks are easy
to be activated into porous materials by activators like lye solution,
zinc chloride, or just water steam.12 Tannin13 studied water purification by rice husk-derived
AC as early as in 1989, and then it was also explored to be used as
current collectors11 and adsorbents for
various dyes and some organic pollutants like Rhodamine B14 and phenol.15

Generally, AC derived from biomass raw materials is powdery or
irregularly granulated and it cannot be used directly in some fields
such as hemoperfusion because the dissociative powders may cause secondary
“pollution”, and the sharp edges of as-prepared irregular-shaped
particles may cause damage to some hemocytes in human blood. Therefore,
in hemoperfusion, spherical AC particles were developed as the adsorbent
to clear away uremia toxins including middle molecules (e.g., leptin,
peptides) and protein-bound molecules (e.g., p-Cresol,
indoxyl sulfate), in which hemodialysis could not solved.16 However, the flow resistance of blood through
the densely packed AC beads is nonnegligible, and concomitantly, the
chances of the collision between the blood cells and the beads during
the blood flowing through in the tortuous passageway would increase
dramatically. To avoid this problem, AC could be prepared in monolith
with hierarchical pores to lower pressure drop17 and promote adsorption capacity. For example, Yu at al.18 obtained honeycomb briquette-shaped activated
charcoal with 2 mm × 2 mm square channels by directly extruding
AC paste and then took it to adsorb volatile organic compounds. Bai
et al.19 prepared hierarchically porous
cellulose/AC composite monoliths to remove toxic dyes from waste water.

In this study, rice husks, which used to be the precursor for producing
powdery AC, were taken as the main raw material to prepare lotus root-type
monolithic AC with hierarchical pores by an injection molding process,
followed by carbonization and activation. The morphology, microstructure,
and chemical composition were characterized, and especially, the pore
structure evolution was studied before and after carbonization and
activation by nitrogen adsorption analyses and mercury intrusion tests.
Particularly, the adsorption of vitamin B12 (VB12), a representative
of middle molecular toxins in human blood, was evaluated by a self-designed
testing platform which simulated the in vitro hemoperfusion process.

Results
and Discussion
Morphology, Microstructure, and Chemical
Composition
The morphology and microstructure of the carbonized
rice husks and
the monoliths after being carbonized and activated are shown in Figure 1. The size of the
grinded particles of carbonized rice husks was about several to dozens
of micrometers, which was comparable to the size of powdery binder,
that is, carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC). The monoliths were cylindrical
with adjustable diameters and lengths. The intersection was uniformly
distributed with lotus root-type square holes. The side length was
about 1.3 mm, and the wall thickness was about 0.7 mm. After being
activated, more big pores appeared in the cross-section of the pore
walls (Figure 1c,d).
Compared to densely packed spherical adsorbents in the commercialized
hemoditoxifier, the lotus root-type monolithic AC could not only lower
the pressure drop during hemoperfusion because of the straight long
channels20 but also avoid the frequent
harmful collisions between the hemocytes and the densely packed spherical
adsorbents during their flow through the circuitous channels in practical
hemoperfusion. Besides the millimeter-sized straight channels in the
lotus root-type monolith, plentiful macro, meso, and micropores in
the channel walls were crucial to adsorb the toxins in the solution
or human blood. The detailed analyses about the pore structure would
be discussed in the next section.

activation (d).

It is well known that not only
the pore structure but also the
chemical composition, especially the surface functional groups, would
influence the adsorption properties of the adsorbent. In this study,
Raman and infrared spectra were adopted to examine the chemical variations
of the monolith after carbonization and activation. According to Raman
results in Figure 2a, we could find that there was no big difference between the carbonized
and activated samples, which indicated that the (002) planar crystal
structure varied little. Similar low ID/IG values in both carbonized and activated
samples indicated that the carbon in the monoliths was mainly defective.
Nevertheless, although the defects were detrimental to mechanical
and electrical properties, they would conduce to activation, and moreover,
the ubiquitous defects would be active sites, which were favorable
for efficient adsorption. Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) results (Figure 2b) indicated that the chemical bonds experienced a huge change before
and after carbonization. There were a large number of functional groups
such as −OH (3500–3400 cm–1), −COOH
(3300–2500 cm–1), and N–O (1570 and
1553 cm–1) in the carbonized samples. In addition,
silicon (Si)-related chemical bonds such as Si–O (1086 and
1080 cm–1) and O–Si–O (461 cm–1) were discernible as well. However, after activation,
most oxygen-related functional groups were disappeared, only a little
−OH and O–Si–O remained. The analyses about the
variation of chemical groups could be further corroborated by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data (Figure 2c). The ratio of C/Si increased from 9.50:1
to 12.33:1 after activation, and the atomic ratio of Si decreased
to 5.91%. The decrease of oxygen was in accordance with the FTIR results
in which −OH and −COOH were removed.

(b) spectra, and XPS spectra (c) of
the monolith after carbonization and activation.

Analyses of Pore Structures
Detailed pore structures
of the monoliths were investigated by N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms (Figure 3a,b) and mercury intrusion method (Figure 3c). The adsorption isotherms of lotus root-type
monolithic AC exhibited both the character of Type I, which was the
typical adsorption isotherms of traditional AC and that of Type H4,
which always indicated the existence of slit-like mesopores.21 More specifically, at ultra-low pressure (p/p0 < 0.01), the adsorption
volume increased a bit, which indicated that there were some micropores
while the amount was limited. As the relative pressure increased (0.01
< p/p0 < 0.8),
the adsorption capacity increased rapidly and the desorption hysteresis
loop of Type H4 appeared, which demonstrated the existence of narrow
slit-like mesopores.22,23 At higher pressure (0.8 < p/p0 < 1.0), there was no
distinct growth about the pore volume. Based on the results from the
quench solid density functional theory (QSDFT) method (inset of Figure 3b), we could find
that before activation, the micropores were mainly in the range of
1.0–1.5 nm with a single peak at about 1.2 nm. After activation,
the size distribution of micropores in the samples demonstrated a
bimodal distribution, that is, one peak at about 1.0 nm and the other
at about 1.5 nm. Moreover, a large number of mesopores with a peak
diameter at about 2.2 nm was produced, and the volume of the initial
mesopores with a peak diameter at about 5 nm was enlarged remarkably
(Figure 3b). In addition,
the results from mercury intrusion examinations showed that the sizes
of macropores concentrated in the range of 1–3 μm (Figure 3c). Therefore, as
a whole, the alkali activation process not only broadened the initial
micropores but also created more micropores and mesopores in the channel
walls. Specifically, the pore volume and specific area of the ultimate
monolithic sample achieved 1.28 mL g–1 and 329 m2 g–1, respectively. The volume of mesopores
and micropores increased more than two times after activation treatment
(Table 1). This indicated
that alkali activation was rather efficient for rice husk-derived
carbon, and this might be attributed to the inherent siliceous materials
in rice husks which was active to alkali. As a whole, the monolith
derived from the biomass carbon with a hierarchical pore structure
could be expected to be a promising adsorbent.

Adsorption Capacity
VB12 was usually adopted
as the representative of middle molecular toxins in hemoperfusion
tests.24 The molecular weight of VB12 was 1355 Da with the size of about 2.09 nm.4 Adsorption tests showed that the adsorption capacity of
the powdery AC was 10.6 mg g–1. Obviously, it could
not be used directly as the adsorbent in hemoditoxifiers because the
probable secondary “pollution” for the tiny particles
might pass through the filter screens at the two ends of the instrument
and enter the bloodstream, although inevitably, the adsorption capacity
would decrease once the AC particles were fabricated into an integrated
monolith. Figure 4 shows
the adsorption curves of the monoliths at 37 °C measured by the
self-designed testing platform (Figure 6) which simulated the practical hemoperfusion process.
The adsorption capacity decreased to 1.05 and 3.66 mg g–1 for carbonized and activated monoliths, respectively. For the activated
monolith, not only the adsorption capacity but also the adsorption
rate was much higher than the carbonized one, especially in the first
hour. The results about the adsorption capacity for the monoliths
acquired by this test platform were rather significant for this process
was particularly close to practical clinical treatment. However, the
adsorption performance should be further enhanced to bring the biomass-derived
lotus root-like porous monoliths to practical applications.

Conclusions
With resourceful rice husks as the raw materials,
lotus root-type
monolithic AC was fabricated by the injection molding process followed
by carbonization and activation. Besides millimeter-sized continuous
channels, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and mercury intrusion
tests indicated that micro, meso, and macropores were also introduced
in the wall of the channels after carbonization and activation. BET
tests showed that the pore volume and specific area of the monolithic
sample were about 1.28 mL g–1 and 329 m2 g–1, respectively. Adsorption capacity of VB12, the representative of middle molecular toxins in human
blood, was about 3.66 mg g–1 based on a specially
designed testing platform which simulated the practical clinical hemoperfusion
process. The continuous channels in the lotus root-like monoliths
could not only lower the pressure drop but also avoid detrimental
collisions between the hemocytes and the adsorbents during the blood
purification process. The micro, meso, and macropores in the channel
walls could be further developed and modified to promote the adsorption
capacity and selectivity, and thus the lotus root-type monolithic
AC with a hierarchical porous structure derived from rice husks would
be the promising candidate as adsorbents in hemoperfusion.

Materials
and Methods
Materials and Preparation
Rice husks, one of the extensive
biomaterials with the natural porous structure, were chosen as the
raw material. First, rice husks were precarbonized in an inert atmosphere
at 850 °C. Then, after the carbonized rice husks were mixed with
powdery CMC, which was used as the binder, they were further grinded
to get a more uniform dispersion and smaller particle size. Subsequently,
the powdery mixture was extruded to regular lotus root-type monolith
via an injection molding machine under 6 MPa at room temperature after
the mixture was sprinkled with a certain amount of deionized water.
Then, to remove the binder, the monolith was carbonized in an inert
atmosphere at 850 °C once again. Finally, the carbonized monolith
was activated by 10 wt % sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solution,
and it was further cleaned by diluted hydrochloric acid and deionized
water until the washing water was neutral. The whole process is illustrated
in Figure 5, and it
should be emphasized that the activation treatment was taken not only
to decrease the content of silicon but also to develop micro and mesopores
in the long channel walls. The monolithic block could be cut into
small pieces with any length needed.

monolithic AC.

Characterization
The morphology and microstructure
of the lotus root-type monolithic AC were characterized by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini SEM 500 from Zeiss). Raman examination
(LabRAM HR Evolution from HORIBA Jobin Yvon) with a 532 nm laser light
source was used to check the graphitization degree of the powders.
Meanwhile, FTIR (X70 from NETZSCH) spectroscopy and XPS (250Xl from
Thermo Fisher Co.) were adopted to examine the chemical bonds and
the chemical composition. Nitrogen adsorption (QUADRASORB SI-MP) and
mercury intrusion (AutoPore IV 9500) tests were performed to investigate
the pore structures, including specific surface area and the size
distribution of the meso, micro, and macropores. The pore distributions
were calculated by the DFT method (N2 at 77 K on carbon,
slit/cylindrical pores, QSDFT equilibrium model) and the BET method.

Adsorption Testing
VB12 (Shanghai DiBai
biotechnology Co., Ltd.), with the molecular weight of 1355 Da,24 was employed as the representative of middle
molecular toxins in human blood to assess the adsorptive capacity
of the porous samples.25 Different from
previous work, in this study, a set of the in vitro testing platform,
which simulated the practical medical hemoperfusion process, was specially
designed to measure the actual adsorption capacity of the monolithic
adsorbent in the chamber of a hemoditoxifier (Figure 6). The platform included 1000 mL VB12 aqueous solution
(80 mg L–1) keeping at 37 °C in the water bath,
a peristaltic pump, and a self-made hemoditoxifier, in which a segment
of lotus root-type sample with the diameter of about 50 mm was put
in. VB12 aqueous solution was circulated in the platform
at the rate of 200 mL min–1 with the help of a peristaltic
pump just like the practical hemoperfusion clinical treatment. The
dynamic adsorption was continued for 2 h, and the duration was just
the same as a single clinical treatment. The variations of VB12 solution concentration were detected by an ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 360 nm. The
adsorption capacities were calculated by the following eq 1 1  where Q (mg g–1) meant the adsorption capacity, and C0 and C1 were the
concentration of the
solution before and after being purified, respectively. Meanwhile, V and m were the volume of the solution
and the weight of the adsorbent. Obviously, the adsorption capacity
obtained by the aforementioned platform might be more valuable to
clinical applications compared with that got by static adsorption
in a shaking bath.25 Nevertheless, the
adsorption capacity of the powdery raw material, such as the carbonized
rice husks, which might cause blockage of the filter screen in the
self-made hemoditoxifier or could not be intercepted by the filter
screen and then “contaminated” the solution, could only
be examined by a regular shaking bath platform.26 Powder (50 mg) was added to 30 mL of VB12 aqueous
solution (80 mg L–1) in an Erlenmeyer flask, and
then the mixture was kept in the shaking bath at 37 °C and 120
rpm min–1 in the dark room for 2 h.
