Modulations of synaptic membranes
play an essential role in
the physiological and pathological functions of the presynaptic
protein α-synuclein (αSyn). Here we used solution atomic
force microscopy (AFM) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy
to investigate membrane modulations caused by αSyn. We used
several lipid bilayers to explore how different lipid species may regulate
αSyn–membrane interactions. We found that at a protein-to-lipid
ratio of ∼1/9, αSyn perturbed lipid bilayers by generating
semi-transmembrane defects that only span one leaflet. In addition,
αSyn coaggregates with lipid molecules to produce ∼10
nm-sized lipoprotein nanoparticles. The obtained AFM data are consistent
with the apolipoprotein characteristic of αSyn. The role of
anionic lipids was elucidated by comparing results from zwitterionic
and anionic lipid bilayers. Specifically, our AFM measurements showed
that anionic bilayers had a larger tendency of forming bilayer defects;
similarly, our EPR measurements revealed that anionic bilayers exhibited
more substantial changes in lipid chain mobility and bilayer
polarity. We also studied the effect of cholesterol. We found that
cholesterol increased the capability of αSyn in inducing bilayer
defects and altering lipid chain mobility and bilayer polarity.
These data can be explained by an increase in the lipid headgroup–headgroup
spacing and/or specific cholesterol−αSyn interactions.
Interestingly, we found an inhibitory effect of the cone-shaped phosphatidylethanolamine
lipids on αSyn-induced bilayer remodeling. We explained our
data by considering interlipid hydrogen-bonding that can stabilize
bilayer organization and suppress lipid extraction. Our results of
lipid-dependent membrane modulations are likely relevant to αSyn
functioning.

1 Introduction
The
detrimental Parkinson’s disease (PD) is featured by
selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.1,2 One pathogenic hallmark of PD is the formation of filamentous aggregates
known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites.3,4 Genome-wide
association studies have shown that the rare form of familial
PD is caused by missense mutations of a protein called α-synuclein
(αSyn).5 Moreover, duplication6 and triplication7 of
the SNCA gene encoding αSyn are sufficient
to cause a highly penetrant form of PD. The causative role played
by αSyn in idiopathic PD is further substantiated by observations
that intraneuronal deposits in PD brains are mainly composed of αSyn.3

αSyn is a highly conserved cytosolic
protein mainly localized
at presynaptic nerve terminals. The 140-residue protein contains an
N-terminus harboring seven imperfect repeats of eleven-residue; the
central region contains a hydrophobic domain referred to as NAC (non-Aβ
component); the C-terminus is negatively charged and largely unstructured.
Similar to apolipoproteins, the eleven-residue repeats of αSyn
enhance its membrane-binding affinity8 and
may be responsible for aggregating with lipid molecules to form lipoprotein
particles.9 Membrane association is also
supported by secondary structure studies. αSyn is largely unfolded
in aqueous solution; peripheral membrane association converts the
N-terminus of αSyn into an extended or broken α-helix.10−12 Although not fully understood, both physiological and pathological
functions of αSyn involve membrane interactions.13 For instance, overexpression of αSyn caused
membrane disruption of mitochondria,14 Golgi
apparatus,15 and endoplasmic reticulum.16

PD is featured by the accumulation of
αSyn-dominated inclusion
deposits in pathological brains. Accumulating evidence suggests that
formation of fibrillar aggregates might be a cellular mechanism to
cope with more toxic prefibrillar species.17−20 Indeed, high levels of αSyn
are directly associated with PD pathology.6,7 Despite
many strides being made in understanding the physiopathological functions
of αSyn,21 the molecular mechanism
of how αSyn gains cytotoxic properties and causes dopaminergic
neuronal death remains unclear.

The amphipathic characteristic
of αSyn confers its ability
to interact with lipid membranes,22 yielding
highly curved structures such as tubules,23−25 nanoparticles,9 and micelles.26 Membrane
interactions of αSyn could lead to nerve cell dysfunction by
different mechanisms. One possibility is that specific lipids facilitate
the generation of toxic αSyn aggregates (e.g., oligomers). A
second possibility is based on the duplication and triplication of
the SNCA gene. The resulting abnormal accumulation
of αSyn might interfere with the normal membrane fission–fusion
dynamics that are essential to synaptic vesicle cycling. A third possibility
is that αSyn participates in synaptic vesicle cycling by promoting
membrane curvature remodeling; overexpression of αSyn could
cause an imbalance between the vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis.
Together, a better understanding of the mechanism of synaptic membrane
interactions of αSyn will help elucidate both the physiological
and pathological functions of αSyn.

In this work, we used
high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM)
and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to investigate
changes in lipid bilayer material properties caused by αSyn.
Our AFM measurements can visually detect nanoscale changes in lipid
membrane topographic structures, and our EPR measurements probe molecular-level
lipid mobility and bilayer polarity. The obtained experimental data
highlight the concept that αSyn can carry out its physiopathological
functions by altering membrane properties. Many lipids play key roles
in synaptic vesicle cycling.27 Lipid-specific
interactions of αSyn might interfere with synaptic vesicle cycling.
To elucidate different synaptic lipids that might be responsible for
αSyn–membrane interactions, we selectively studied lipid
bilayers containing 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (POPG),  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), and cholesterol
(Chol) lipids. By determining the impacts of αSyn on physical
properties of lipid bilayers containing different lipid species, our
study provides useful insights into the role of various synaptic lipids
in regulating αSyn–membrane interactions.

2 Results
2.1 AFM Experiments on Planar Lipid Bilayers
2.1.1 POPC/POPG Bilayer
We used
AFM imaging to visualize the effect of αSyn on topographical
structures of mica-supported planar bilayers composed of POPC/POPG
4:1. (Unless noted otherwise, all ratios and percentages are molar
based in this paper.) AFM height image of the control bilayer
is shown in Figure 1A. The bilayer exhibited a homogeneous organization over the 10 μm
× 10 μm area. After confirming the quality of the intact
bilayer, we used a syringe pump to inject a 1 μM αSyn
solution into the AFM fluid cell. The protein incubation time was
set to zero right after the injection. After incubation of 39 min,
sporadic defects with a circular shape and a length scale of ∼2
μm were observed (Figure 1B). The image at 74 min revealed similar micron-scale defects,
accompanied by a few smaller ones with a length scale of a few hundred
nanometers. Similar micron-scale defects were observed after incubation
of 139 min. On the other hand, the in situ measurements revealed that
the surface area fraction covered by the defects increased with the
incubation time. This is quantified by image analysis showing that
the defect area fraction is 0.14, 0.20, and 0.41 at the incubation
times of 39, 74, and 139 min, respectively.

4:1 bilayer exposed to 1 μM αSyn
as a function of the incubation time. Scale bars are 2 μm. Image
height scale is indicated by the color bar at the bottom. The same
color bar (with modified height scale if noted) is applied throughout
the paper for AFM images. The area fractions of αSyn-induced semi-transmembrane defects are 0.14, 0.20, and 0.41 as the incubation time increases from 39 to 139 min.

AFM probes lipid bilayer structures
in both horizontal and vertical
directions. The sub-Å sensitivity along bilayer normal enables
us to determine the height profile of αSyn-induced defects (Figure 2). We found that
the edge of the circularly shaped defects has a depth of ∼1–1.5
nm below the bilayer surface. Considering that the thickness of POPC
and POPG bilayers is ∼3 nm,28,29 the observed
defects only span one leaflet of the mica-supported bilayer. We also
noticed that the interior of the defects contained many inhomogeneous
features. To explore the detailed structure inside bilayer defects,
we performed high-resolution AFM scans. Although not evident in micron-scale
images, numerous nanoscale particles were clearly seen in the high-resolution
image (Figure 2B).
To estimate the height of the observed particles, we selected an arbitrary
path crossing several particles (Figure 2B). Height profile along the path showed
that the nanoscale particles have a height of ∼2–6 nm
(Figure 2C).

μm for (B). (C) Height profiles along the solid green lines
in (A) and (B).

We next performed image
analysis to characterize particle sizes.
A height threshold was used to distinguish particles from the background.
(Pixels with heights larger than the threshold were considered as
particles.) To account for pixels with occasional large heights (noise),
a cutoff was used to discard particles smaller than ∼12 nm2. The resulting particles (i.e., bright regions in the binary
image) are shown in Figure S1. Particle
size was determined by the number of pixels (scaled by pixel size)
occupied by each particle. Lastly, we converted the particle size
to a particle radius by assuming that particles are circularly shaped.
The probability distribution of the determined particle radius is
shown in Figure S1. Gaussian curve fitting
resulted in a most probable particle radius of 7 nm. Collectively,
αSyn perturbed the POPC/POPG bilayer by forming semi-transmembrane
defects; the interior of the defects was dispersed with many nanoscale
particles, which have a height of ∼2–6 nm and an average
radius of 7 nm.

2.1.2 POPC Bilayer
We also used AFM imaging
to study the effect of αSyn on zwitterionic POPC bilayers. Sporadic
defects were observed after incubation with 1 μM αSyn
for 40 and 120 min (Figure 3). Interestingly, the defects have serrated edges. Image analysis
showed that the defect area fractions are 0.04 and 0.10 at the incubation
times of 40 and 120 min, respectively. These values are smaller compared
to those of the POPC/POPG bilayer at similar incubation times. Figure 4 shows two high-resolution
images encompassing one defect. Height profile indicated that POPC
defects have a depth of ∼1.5 nm (Figure 4C). Circularly shaped particles were observed
inside the defect. Height profile showed that the nanoscale particles
have a height of ∼2–6 nm. We selected a region inside
the defect to estimate the particle size (Figure S2). Gaussian curve fitting showed that the most probable defect
radius is 11 nm.

2.1.3 POPC/Chol
Bilayer
We used a POPC
+ 30% Chol bilayer to study the role of Chol in mediating αSyn–bilayer
interactions. AFM images are shown in Figure 5. Circularly shaped defects were observed
after exposing the bilayer to 1 μM αSyn. The defect area
fractions are 0.04 and 0.17 at the incubation times of 27 and 107
min, respectively. Detailed defect structures were obtained by high-resolution
scans focusing on one defect (Figure 6). Height profile showed that the defect depth is ∼2
nm, slightly larger than the values for POPC/POPG and POPC bilayers.
The interior of the defect also contained many particles. Height profile
revealed that the particles have a height of ∼2–6 nm,
the same range as for POPC/POPG and POPC bilayers. Image analysis
showed that the particle radius distribution does not conform to a
Gaussian distribution (Figure S3). Nevertheless,
the average particle radius is about 10 nm.

bars are 2 μm. The area fractions of αSyn-induced semi-transmembrane defects are 0.04 and 0.17 as the incubation time increases from 27 to 107 min.

(A) and (B).

2.1.4 POPC/POPE
Bilayer
We used POPC/POPE
bilayers to study the role of PE lipids in modulating membrane perturbations
caused by αSyn. Figure 7 shows the AFM images of a POPC + 15% POPE bilayer treated
with 1 μM αSyn. Dispersed defects were observed as the
incubation time increased from 22 to 105 min. Longer incubation resulted
in more defects. This is manifested by the defect area fractions,
which are 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 at the incubation times of 22, 58,
and 105 min, respectively. Compared to the POPC bilayer, the defect
area fraction is smaller for the POPC + 15% POPE bilayer at similar
incubation times. Height profile showed that the defects in the POPC
+ 15% POPE bilayer have a depth of ∼1 nm (Figure 8). Nanoscale particles were
also present in the interior of the defects. Height profile indicated
that the particles have a height of ∼2–6 nm. Particle
size is estimated by image analysis shown in Figure S4. A most probable particle radius of 7 nm was obtained by
Gaussian curve fitting. We also examined a POPC + 40% POPE bilayer.
After incubation with 1 μM αSyn for 106 min, no discernable
defects were observed (Figure S5). By comparing
results from POPC/POPE bilayers with a varying content of POPE, we
conclude that POPE suppressed the effect of αSyn in inducing
semi-transmembrane defects.

2.2 EPR Spectroscopy
Experiments on Lipid Vesicles
2.2.1 Lipid Bilayer Fluidity
EPR spectra
in the X-band (9.5 GHz) were used to determine lipid bilayer fluidity
(or mobility) changes upon αSyn binding. EPR spectral line shapes
are influenced by molecular motion and therefore reflect lipid fluidity.30,31 In particular, an increase in the spectral peak-to-peak splitting
and/or a broadening of the spectral line shape indicate slower molecular
motion. To assess mobility changes induced by αSyn binding,
we chose 5-doxyl stearic acid (5-SASL) as the spin probe because position
5 of the acyl chain has been demonstrated to be the most sensitive
to mobility changes in several molecular models.32,33 We note that EPR spectroscopy mainly reports an averaged change
of the microenvironment near the spin probe. Here, lipid mobility
changes were defined using the motional parameter 2A//, the peak-to-peak splitting of the spectrum, upon αSyn
binding to lipid bilayers with different compositions. The protein-to-lipid
(P/L) ratios investigated range from 1/200 to 1/50. As illustrated
in Figures 9 and S6, the 2A// values
were increased for negatively charged POPC/POPG 4:1 bilayers upon
αSyn binding, indicating a decreased lipid mobility. A comparable
decrease in lipid mobility was observed for POPC bilayers with 30%
Chol. Conversely, minimal changes were observed for zwitterionic POPC
bilayers.

Figure 9 Lipid mobility changes for POPC (red), POPC + 30% Chol (orange),
and POPC/POPG 4:1 (green) bilayers in the presence of αSyn at
three P/L ratios. The unit for the mobility change is Gauss. Greater
2A// values reflect lower lipid mobility
and membrane fluidity.

2.2.2 Lipid Bilayer Polarity
The effect
of αSyn on lipid bilayer polarity was assessed by EPR power
saturation and solvent accessibility experiments.34 Because a polarity gradient is present across lipid bilayers,
nonpolar molecules are more accessible to lipid acyl chains, while
polar agents accumulate in the solvent and around the polar or
charged headgroups of phospholipids. The equilibrium can be perturbed
by molecules that modulate the bilayer structure and organization.
EPR power saturation experiments are suitable to evaluate the polarity
of lipid bilayers and how the polarity is perturbed by macromolecules.
To achieve this information, we exploited the saturation of the EPR
signal of a nitroxide placed at a specific position (5-SASL) of the
acyl chain with increasing microwave power, which can be quantified
using the saturation parameter P1/2. P1/2 values in the presence of the nonpolar reagent
O2 and the polar reagent nickel(II) ethylenediaminediacetate
(NiEDDA) can be used to calculate a depth parameter Φ, which
reflects the polarity at a given position of the lipid bilayer. Figure 10 reports the Φ
values for POPC, POPC/POPG 4:1, and POPC + 30% Chol bilayers with
trace amounts of 5-SASL in the absence and presence of αSyn
at P/L = 1/100. To be noted, the Φ values for the bilayers without
αSyn are comparable between POPC and POPC/POPG 4:1, while the
Φ value is larger for POPC + 30% Chol. The larger Φ value
in the presence of Chol is caused by an enhanced lipid chain order
and a reduced solvent penetration. The addition of αSyn caused
no significant changes in the Φ value for POPC bilayers, confirming
the weak perturbations observed in the mobility experiment (Figure 9). On the contrary,
there is a considerable decrease in the Φ value for POPC/POPG
bilayers upon αSyn binding (35%) and an even larger decrease
for POPC + 30% Chol bilayers (43%). These data indicate that αSyn
interacts strongly with POPC/POPG 4:1 and POPC + 30% Chol bilayers,
causing more polar solvent penetration.

1/100. (D) Comparison of the percentage of the Φ value changes

values indicate lower polarity.

3 Discussion
3.1 Mechanism of Bilayer Perturbation by αSyn
We
used solution AFM to explore structural remodeling of several
lipid bilayers induced by αSyn. A common theme is the observation
of micron-scale semi-transmembrane defects after treating planar bilayers
with 1 μM αSyn − aggregation of αSyn
occurs at much higher concentrations even in the presence of
anionic lipids.35 Pore-like structures
induced by αSyn have been reported earlier.36,37 Our AFM measurements provide the first evidence that αSyn
only causes semi-transmembrane defects, not membrane-spanning pores.
The formation of semi-transmembrane defects is based on the measurement
of defect depth, which is ∼1–2 nm. Note that we
have used AFM imaging and obtained transmembrane defects with a depth
of ∼4 nm when exposing lipid bilayers to an amphipathic Prion
peptide.38 Generation of semi-transmembrane
defects requires removal of lipid molecules from the top leaflet of
the planar bilayer. Therefore, our AFM data support the mechanism
of lipid extraction by αSyn. Many amphipathic peptides have
a similar ability to extract lipid molecules from bilayer assemblies,39,40 a mechanism known as the detergent effect. After binding to lipid
membranes, αSyn transits from a disordered structure to a helix-enriched
conformation.8 Depending on the membrane
curvature, αSyn can form an extended helix12 or two broken helices.10 In
either case, αSyn exhibits an amphipathic characteristic where
hydrophobic residues are segregated on one face, and polar and charged
residues are enriched on the opposite face. The amphipathic characteristic
of αSyn is likely to be responsible for the lipid extraction
effect observed in our study. The lipid extraction effect of αSyn
is also supported by other studies. For example, αSyn caused
fragmentation of giant unilamellar vesicles;41 αSyn can act as a vesicle fusion promoter.42 Both bilayer fragmentation and vesicle fusion require lipid
extraction from the parent bilayer.

Because we only observe
defects formed in one leaflet, it seems that αSyn does not have
the ability to translocate from one leaflet to the other. This result
is in line with studies showing that αSyn only inserted into
the proximal leaflet where the protein was administrated.41 Insertion of αSyn (at low concentrations
before the formation of bilayer defects) into one leaflet will cause
an area expansion of the target leaflet, whereas the area of the other
leaflet will remain unchanged.43 The asymmetric
area expansion across the coupled leaflets might cause bilayer bulging
and tubulation.23,25,26

Within each semi-transmembrane defect, the removal of the
top leaflet
by αSyn will cause lipid acyl chains of the bottom leaflet being
exposed to water. Such an arrangement is energetically unfavorable.
We can speculate several mechanisms to counteract the unfavorable
hydrophobic effect of exposed lipid acyl chains. Our AFM imaging showed
that the number of particles in the interior of the defect is fairly
large. These particles can cover part of the exposed lipid acyl chains.
αSyn monomers that did not participate in particle formation
can contribute to shielding the exposed lipid acyl chains by residing
on the surface of the bottom leaflet. The lipids extracted from the
top leaflet may interdigitate with the bottom leaflet to form a compacted
pseudo-monolayer. Lastly, lipid molecules at the bottom leaflet may
have a slow desorption rate from the mica surface. This will result
in a temporarily trapped pseudo-monolayer.

In addition to semi-transmembrane
defects, we report ∼10
nm-sized particles formed in the interior of the defects. Two explanations
can account for the obtained nanoparticles. One is the formation of
αSyn oligomers after binding to lipid bilayers. However, the
size of the nanoparticles is larger than those of soluble oligomers
prepared from monomeric αSyn.44,45 Moreover,
protein aggregation of αSyn takes a longer time (e.g., a few
days) than the duration of our AFM experiment.46 The most likely cause for the observed nanoparticles is
that αSyn coaggregates with lipid molecules to form the ∼10
nm-sized nanoparticles. The possibility of forming lipoprotein nanoparticles
is corroborated by the apolipoprotein motif of αSyn.
Moreover, 7–10 nm-sized lipoprotein nanoparticles were reported
when incubating αSyn with lipid vesicles.9

The lipid extraction by 1 μM αSyn likely
represents
a later event following protein binding. It is conceivable that when
the concentration of αSyn becomes smaller, the probability of
developing semi-transmembrane defects will be diminished. This is
confirmed by our AFM experiments when exposing POPC/POPG 4:1 bilayers
to αSyn solutions containing lower protein concentrations. Specifically,
we found no defects at 0.2 μM αSyn and a few defects at
0.5 μM αSyn (data not shown). The observed trend is consistent
with the theory that there is a minimum number of lipid molecules
that are required to completely bind one αSyn molecule.47 Depending on the lipid bilayer composition,
the minimum number was estimated to be ∼85–2000 lipids
per αSyn.47 Bilayer destabilization
can occur when the number of lipids is smaller than the required minimum
lipid number. We estimated the P/L ratio (and the number of lipids
per αSyn) used in our AFM experiments. The fluid cell diameter
is ∼8 mm. Assuming an area per lipid of 0.62 nm2, the total number of lipids in one mica-supported bilayer is 1.62
× 1014. Assuming a fluid cell volume of 30 μL,
the corresponding P/L ratios are 1/9, 1/18, and 1/45 at 1, 0.5, and
0.2 μM αSyn, respectively. These values indicate that
at 1 μM αSyn, the number of lipids per αSyn is smaller
than the lower boundary of the required minimum lipid number (i.e.,
85). Due to the insufficiency of lipid molecules to completely bind
all αSyn molecules, bilayer disruption (e.g., lipid extraction)
can be elicited by excess αSyn. Therefore, our AFM data agree
with the theory of the minimum lipid number per bound αSyn.47

Our EPR experiments were performed at
low P/L ratios where the
probability of lipid extraction by αSyn is small. Therefore,
the obtained EPR data mostly reflect bilayer structural changes before
the formation of semi-transmembrane defects. Another aspect is that
spin probes at the inner and outer leaflets of lipid vesicles are
likely to be affected differently by αSyn because the protein
was added to the outside of the vesicles. Consequently, the obtained
EPR data reflect an averaged effect of αSyn on lipid bilayer
properties. For all the three bilayers studied, we observed an increase
in the spectral peak-to-peak splitting, although the increase was much
larger for POPC/POPG and POPC/Chol than for POPC. An increase in the
peak-to-peak splitting indicates that αSyn reduced lipid mobility
and bilayer fluidity. A similar result was reported by an earlier
EPR spectroscopy study, which showed that αSyn restricted the
segmental rotational mobility and increased the chain order of an
anionic fluid bilayer.48 A reduction in
bilayer fluidity was also reported by measuring changes in the general
polarization of POPG bilayers.49 Computational
simulations have predicted somewhat conflicting results. Both chain
ordering50 and disordering43 were reported by the same group. Overall, αSyn can
modulate structural and dynamical properties of lipid bilayers. Depending
on the mode of bilayer interactions (e.g., bilayer penetration depth),
the resulting changes in lipid bilayer properties can vary. For example,
a shallow binding to the headgroup region is likely to have less impact
on bilayer chain organization than a deep penetration into the hydrocarbon
core.

3.2 Effect of Anionic Lipids
Anionic
lipids are important constituents of presynaptic nerve terminals,
where cytosolic αSyn is located. Our AFM data of POPC and POPC/POPG
bilayers showed that αSyn caused a larger degree of bilayer
perturbation when anionic lipid POPG was present. This is reflected
in the difference of the defect area fraction. The edge of the defects
also seems different. A smoother edge in the presence of POPG may
represent a larger degree of the cooperativity of αSyn molecules
in generating bilayer defects. Despite these differences, the nanoparticles
produced by αSyn have a similar size scale (i.e., ∼10
nm radius) without or with 20% POPG. A larger degree of bilayer perturbation
in the presence of POPG is also observed in our EPR experiments. In
particular, spectral line-shape measurements revealed that αSyn
caused a larger decrease in lipid mobility for the POPC/POPG than
for the POPC bilayer. Similarly, EPR power saturation measurements
showed a more significant increase in bilayer polarity when POPG was
present. Our observation of a larger effect of αSyn on lipid
bilayers containing POPG is consistent with the long-known role of
anionic lipids in regulating αSyn–membrane interactions.
αSyn adopts a helical conformation after binding to lipid membranes.8 Helical wheel analysis showed that many basic
residues are located at the interface between the polar and nonpolar
faces.8,11 The basic characteristic of αSyn is
the primary cause for its marked preference of binding to membranes
containing anionic lipids.8,47 The strong binding
of αSyn to anionic lipids may modulate the kinetics of αSyn
aggregation.35 Interestingly, not only
the number of charges but also the position of the basic residues
was found to affect membrane association of αSyn.51 Introduction of basic residues on the hydrophobic
face of αSyn hindered its conformational change and diminished
its membrane binding.51

3.3 Effect of Chol
Synaptic vesicles
have a high Chol content.52 Although the
function of vesicular Chol remains to be defined, Chol likely participates
in synaptic vesicle cycling.53 At presynaptic
plasma membranes, Chol was found to be required for vesicle biogenesis.54 Chol can affect protein functioning by modulating
membrane material properties.55−57 In addition, Chol can act as
a ligand by directly binding to proteins. Many studies have linked
Chol to chronic neurodegenerative disorders.58

By monitoring monolayer pressure, Fantini et al. found that
αSyn had a high affinity for Chol.59 The authors also identified a segment of αSyn (residues 67–78)
called “titled peptide” that is hydrophobic and responsible
for Chol binding. Molecular simulation revealed that the binding was
facilitated by structural complementary between the rough β-face
of Chol and the hydrophobic pocket of the titled peptide.59 In addition, the N-terminus of αSyn (residues
34–45) contains a Chol recognition consensus motif. The consensus
domain was attributed as the second site for Chol binding, albeit
with a weaker affinity.59 Chol binding
may account for Chol efflux caused by exogenous αSyn.60 Chol binding may also increase the local concentration
of αSyn on membrane surfaces; the augmented protein–protein
interactions may then lead to Chol-stimulated αSyn aggregation.61

In addition to direct binding, Chol may
regulate αSyn–membrane
interactions by expanding the lipid headgroup–headgroup spacing;
the increased vacancy in the headgroup region may then better accommodate
αSyn binding and insertion. An analogy to Chol-induced expansion
of the lipid headgroup–headgroup spacing can be found when
studying αSyn binding to lipid unilamellar vesicles with different
radii. αSyn has a stronger binding affinity to vesicles with
smaller radii.8,62 The effect of vesicle curvature
(radius) on αSyn binding can be understood by considering the
intrinsic defects (e.g., vacancy) at the bilayer–water interface.63 Vesicles with larger curvature (i.e., smaller
radius) have more intrinsic defects to facilitate αSyn binding.64

The effect of Chol is revealed by our
AFM and EPR measurements
on POPC and POPC + 30% Chol bilayers. Our AFM experiment showed that
αSyn induced semi-transmembrane defects in both bilayers; the
defect area fraction was larger for POPC/Chol than for POPC bilayers.
In parallel, our EPR experiments showed that αSyn caused larger
changes in lipid mobility and bilayer polarity when Chol was present.
The enhanced bilayer perturbation in the presence of Chol can be caused
by a higher bilayer binding affinity due to Chol−αSyn
recognition.59 Alternatively, Chol expands
lipid headgroup–headgroup spacing,65 allowing more αSyn molecules to insert into the headgroup
region. The lipid mobility and bilayer polarity data from our EPR
measurements are closely related to lipid chain organization. Because
αSyn caused significant changes in lipid mobility and bilayer
polarity of POPC/POPG and POPC/Chol, it is likely that (part of) αSyn
penetrated deeper beyond the lipid headgroup region. This view
is supported by reports from neutron reflection measurements.66,67

3.4 Effect of PE Lipids
PE lipids are
the second most abundant phospholipids in mammalian cells. It accounts
for 20–50 mol % of the total phospholipids; a content of ∼45
mol % is observed in the brain.68 One unique
characteristic of PE lipids is that the polar headgroup has a smaller
in-plane area than that of the hydrophobic acyl chains. The difference
in the in-plane areas renders PE lipids a conical shape. Concomitantly,
lipid assemblies (e.g., monolayer and bilayer) composed of PE lipids
have a negative spontaneous curvature.69 In a bilayer assembly with large curvatures as exemplified by the
synaptic nerve terminals, PE lipids are preferentially packed at the
inner leaflet of the convex membrane. The second important feature
of PE lipids resides in the amine group, which is a good hydrogen-bond
donor. Interlipid hydrogen-bonding between the amine moiety of PE
lipids and the phosphate oxygen (and carbonyl oxygen) of neighboring
lipids contributes to an enhanced bilayer stability.70,71 A structural manifestation of the hydrogen-bonding is that PE lipids
have smaller areas per lipid than those of PC counterparts.72 Hydrogen-bonding renders PE-containing membranes
more resilient to perturbations imparted by external agents. For example,
PE lipids are less susceptible to ethanol-facilitated lipid desorption.73 Our recent study of an amphipathic peptide called
M2AH derived from the influenza M2 protein also showed that POPE inhibited
the activity of M2AH in modulating lipid bilayer properties.74

An earlier study using thin-layer chromatography
showed that αSyn bound to brain PE lipids; the authors also
found that PE lipids in conjugation with anionic lipids, but not PE
lipids alone, increased the helical content of αSyn.36 By monitoring birefringence and protein/lipid
mass ratio, Ouberai et al. reported that cone-shaped PE lipids enhanced
αSyn binding.75 Moreover, the binding
affinity of αSyn to planar bilayers was larger than to curved
vesicles. The authors attributed their findings to PE-induced packing
defects.75

Here we used POPC/POPE
bilayers to investigate the effect of PE
lipids in response to αSyn perturbation. The experiment was
performed at room temperature (∼23 °C). Differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) measurements have been performed by Cannon et al.
on POPC/POPE mixtures with the content of POPE ranging from 61 to
100%.76 DSC peaks were located at ∼18
and 22.4 °C for the POPE contents of 61 and 85%, respectively.
The highest content of POPE in our study is 40%. Based on the relationship
between the DSC peak position and the POPE content reported by Cannon
et al., it is reasonable to deduce that the phase transition temperature
for POPC + 40% POPE is lower than 18 °C. Therefore, the gel-to-fluid
phase transition temperature for the POPC + 40% POPE bilayer is more
than 5 °C below room temperature. Our AFM data suggested that
POPE suppressed the capability of αSyn in inducing semi-transmembrane
defects. This is reflected in the inverse relationship between the
defect area fraction and the POPE content. Notably, no defects were
observed at 40% POPE. Lipid extraction occurs during the formation
of semi-transmembrane defects. The interlipid hydrogen-bonding between
PE and PE (or PC) lipids creates a network that can act against lipid
extraction. Our view of suppressed lipid extraction by αSyn
due to interlipid hydrogen-bonding is substantiated by the finding
that PE lipids negated lipid extraction by ethanol.73 Along the same line, the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 was
found to be inactive against PE monolayers.77 Our observation of the inhibitory effect of PE lipids on αSyn
activity is in stark contrast to the report showing that PE lipids
enhanced αSyn binding.75 One plausible
explanation is that anionic lipids were used together with PE lipids
in the binding assay.75 Lipid–lipid
electrostatic interactions coexist with (and may disrupt) interlipid
hydrogen-bonding. Therefore, the binding assay data cannot be solely
accounted for by considering the effect of PE lipids. Indeed, a mixture
of PE and anionic lipids was found to increase the helical content
of αSyn, whereas PE lipids alone exerted no effect.36 A second possible explanation is that formation
of semi-transmembrane defects observed in our study represents a later
stage following αSyn binding. A larger binding affinity toward
PE bilayers does not necessarily result in more bilayer defects because
the binding and lipid extraction can be two isolated events.

Membrane curvature remodeling is a highly regulated process during
synaptic vesicle trafficking. Due to the abundance of PE lipids at
the inner leaflet of synaptic plasma membranes and the reduced membrane
interactions between αSyn and PE-containing membranes, premature
membrane remodeling caused by αSyn could be inhibited during
synaptic vesicle cycling. Alternatively, displacement of PE lipids
from synaptic active zones78 may promote
αSyn-induced membrane reorganization. As the brain ages, the
PE content in neuronal membranes can decline. In particular, a significantly
lower PE content was reported in PD patients than in control subjects.79 PE deficiency may lead to impaired αSyn–membrane
interactions, thus causing αSyn-associated abnormality.80

4 Conclusions
In this
paper, we used high-resolution AFM and EPR spectroscopy
to investigate membrane modulations caused by the cytosolic protein
αSyn. In particular, we used lipid bilayers with several lipid
compositions to explore different lipid species in regulating αSyn–membrane
interactions. We found that at high P/L ratios, αSyn perturbed
lipid bilayers by forming micron-scale semi-transmembrane defects
and ∼10 nm-sized lipoprotein nanoparticles. The obtained results
are consistent with the amphipathic characteristic and the apolipoprotein
motif of αSyn. By comparing results from POPC and POPC/POPG
bilayers, we confirm the role of anionic lipids in enhancing bilayer
perturbations caused by αSyn. We found that Chol increased the
capability of αSyn in inducing semi-transmembrane defects, decreasing
lipid mobility, and increasing bilayer polarity. The results can be
explained by an increase in the lipid headgroup–headgroup spacing
or specific Chol−αSyn interactions. We found an inhibitory
effect of the cone-shaped POPE lipids on αSyn-induced membrane
remodeling. We explained our data in the context of interlipid hydrogen-bonding
that can stabilize bilayer organization and suppress lipid extraction.
Lipid-dependent selective membrane interactions are likely important
for αSyn functioning. This is exemplified by PD-associated genetic
mutants of αSyn (A30P and A53T), which have weaker membrane
binding affinities compared to the wild type.81

5 Materials and Methods
Lipids including  POPC,
POPG, POPE, and Chol were purchased
from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 5-SASL was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Human recombinant αSyn was purchased
from Alexo-Tech AB (Sweden). Protein purity >95% was verified by
the
vendor (high-performance liquid chromatography and sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Fresh protein stock solutions
were prepared by dissolving lyophilized protein powder in 10 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) pH 7.4. Centrifugation was used to remove preexisting
fibrillar aggregates.

5.1 Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM) Imaging
Lipid mixtures were prepared by mixing appropriate
ratios of lipid
stock solutions in glass test tubes. Organic solvents (chloroform
or chloroform/methanol) were removed by a gentle stream of argon gas,
followed by vacuum pumping for ∼2 h. Lipid dry films were hydrated
in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were produced
by ultrasonication using a Sonic Dismembrator and a 3 mm microprobe.
The obtained SUVs were centrifuged briefly before planar bilayer preparation.
A Multimode 8 AFM (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) and a Nanoscope V controller
were used for solution AFM imaging (room temperature). The experimental
procedure has been reported elsewhere.38,82,83 Mica-supported planar bilayers were prepared by injecting
lipid SUVs into a fluid cell where a freshly cleaved mica film acted
as a solid substrate. SUVs in the vicinity of the mica film were attracted
onto the mica surface, followed by vesicle rupture.84,85 Each ruptured vesicle will form a bilayer patch supported by the
mica film. Because there were many vesicle rupture events taking place
on the mica surface within a short period of time, a complete bilayer
was formed by bilayer patch fusion within a few minutes. Excess SUVs
that did not participate in bilayer formation were flushed out of
the fluid cell by injecting the HEPES buffer. During the bilayer preparation
process, the AFM tip was positioned at ∼50 μm above the
mica surface. The peak-force quantitative nanomechanics (QNM) mode
was used for bilayer scanning with the peak force set to ∼300
pN. Square images were acquired using a silicon nitride probe DNP-S10
with a scan rate of 0.5–1 Hz. To eliminate potential artifacts
induced by repetitive scanning, we manually moved the AFM tip to a
different region after acquiring one or a few images at one location.
The obtained topographic (height) images were leveled by subtracting
a polynomial background. Image analysis was performed using in-house-developed
Matlab scripts.

5.2 Electron Paramagnetic Resonance
(EPR) Spectroscopy
5.2.1 Vesicle Preparation
Unilamellar
liposomes were prepared by the extrusion method. Lipids in chloroform
were mixed in a glass tube and dried as thin films under a stream
of nitrogen gas. 1–2 mol % of 5-SASL was added to the lipid
mixture. To remove residual organic solvent, the lipid films were
further dried using a vacuum pump for ∼16 h. The lipids were
resuspended in a HEPES buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) by vortexing for
1–2 min and then subjected to ≥6 freeze-and-thaw cycles.
The lipid suspension was then extruded ≥30 times through a
mini extruder with a 100 nm polycarbonate membrane (Avanti Polar Lipids).

5.2.2 Lipid Bilayer Fluidity Measurements
Lipid
bilayer fluidity measurements were carried out in X-band (9.5
GHz) on a Bruker E680 continuous-wave and pulsed EPR spectrometer
with a 4119HS high-sensitivity resonator (Bruker, Billerica, MA) at
the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL). EPR spectra were
acquired with 100 kHz modulation frequency, 2.4 mW incident microwave
power (18 dB), 0.16 mT modulation amplitude, 81.92 ms time constant,
81.92 ms conversion time, and 16 mT scan width. Samples were loaded
in 0.6 mm inner-diameter glass capillary tubes. Liposomes with
1 mol % of 5-SASL were prepared in a pH 7.4 HEPES buffer as described
earlier with a total of 10 mM lipid concentration. The protein solution
was mixed with liposomes to achieve the desired P/L ratios.

5.2.3 Lipid Bilayer Polarity Measurements
Lipid bilayer polarity
was determined by EPR power saturation experiments
in X-band (9.5 GHz) on a Bruker E680 spectrometer with a loop-gap
resonator (Molecular Specialties, Milwaukee, WI) at the NHMFL. The
samples were loaded in gas-permeable TPX capillary tubes (Molecular
Specialties) and purged using a stream of either air or nitrogen (N2) gas. EPR spectra were collected at room temperature with
100 kHz modulation frequency, 0.16 mT modulation amplitude, 10.24
ms time constant, 20.48 ms conversion time, and 0.35 mT scan width
centered on the central peak. The microwave power was ramped up automatically
from 0.06 to 118 mW, averaging the spectrum at each power for nine
times. Each power saturation experiment consisted of three sets of
spectra: first, the spectra were collected on the sample under a stream
of air to ensure membrane contact with oxygen (O2); second,
the sample was purged for at least 20 min with a stream of N2 and then the spectra were collected; third, the sample with 50 mM
of nickel(II) ethylenediaminediacetate (NiEDDA) was purged for at
least 20 min with a stream of N2 and then the spectra were
collected. The obtained saturation curves (peak-to-peak amplitude
vs microwave power) were fitted with a standard equation34,86 to derive the saturation parameters P1/2 for O2, N2, and NiEDDA spectra. Based on P1/2, the accessibility of spin probes to relaxing
agents (i.e., O2 and NiEDDA) can be estimated by an accessibility
parameter (Π).34 The dimensionless
polarity (or depth) parameter Φ was calculated from the ratio
of the accessibility values Π (O2) to Π (NiEDDA).34
