We revisit the polymorphism of paracetamol
by means of a micro-Raman
technique, which has proved to be a powerful tool for structure recognition.
Distinct lattice phonon spectra clearly identified the pure phases.
Confocality enabled us to detect phase mixing between form II and
either I or III on a micrometric scale in the same crystallite. Following
the most recent findings on surface-mediated structures, we also investigated
spin-coated films grown on glass, gold, and polystyrene substrates,
confirming the selectivity of these surfaces for the metastable form
III, which shows an unprecedented stability over a time span of several
months. A mechanism of its transformation to phase II, via a partially
ordered intermediate state, is suggested by polarized Raman measurements.

1 Introduction
Among
the various areas where polymorphism plays a relevant role,
pharmaceutics is certainly the one with the highest impact because
of its strategic role in pharmaceutical companies and in the manufacturing
processes for drug development.1−4 In fact, polymorphism has a considerable influence
on solid-state properties, leading to modifications of the biopharmaceutical
behavior of a drug. Hence, it is necessary to optimize the methods
which promote new routes for a fast and nondestructive crystal structure
recognition.

Raman spectroscopy is now recognized as one of
the most performing
analytical tools for molecular and solid-form identification. The
present work aims to investigate, by means of confocal Raman microscopy,
the polymorphism of paracetamol, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide
(Scheme 1), a common
active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). We have focused our spectroscopic
study on the low wavenumber region, typically from 10 to 150 cm–1, whose active modes, called lattice phonons, represent the vibrations of the crystal lattice and, probing the
intermolecular interactions, are very sensitive to even minor modifications
in crystal packing. This approach enables an efficient and in situ
phase characterization,5 with the possibility
of obtaining a topography of the physical purity of the sample by
the detection of a Raman map.6

Scheme 1 Molecular
Structure of Paracetamol
For paracetamol, some of the points mentioned above have
been recently
addressed by Nanubolu and Burley7,8 in the search for transient
forms of this system. The purpose here is to revisit its nonsolvated
forms and to get further hints on their phase mixing and growth behavior.
In particular, contrary to previous findings, we obtained form III
by sublimation, though with the concomitant presence of form II. In
addition, experiments of growth on substrates have been performed
by spin coating solutions of paracetamol on glass, gold, and polystyrene,
in light of the recent findings by Ehmann and Werzer.9 Besides confirming the selectivity of these surfaces for
the metastable form III, we show its unprecedented stability over
a time span of several months. The transformation of form III to II
has been studied spectroscopically, showing that this change starts
on the surface with (001) layers of form II, which subsequently propagate
into the bulk via a partially ordered intermediate state.

2 Results and Discussion
The monoclinic form I,10 present in
the commercial powder, is the most thermodynamically stable polymorph
and is the one available on the market. Form II11 is a metastable phase, which turns into form I at an ambient
temperature. It has distinct processing advantages over form I, as
it undergoes a plastic deformation upon compaction, thus allowing
for direct compression into tablets, which would result in time and
material saving when processed.12 Interestingly,
it is also slightly more soluble than form I. Finally, the metastable
form III13 is also known. Information on
the relative thermodynamic stability of the three forms and on the
phase transformation routes between them is provided by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
given in the Supporting Information (Figures
S1–S5). All crystal structures have been resolved by single-crystal
XRD, and those used in the present work are listed in Table 1.

2.1 Lattice Phonon Raman Spectra:
Forms I, II,
and III
Form I was obtained by crystallization from ethanol
and methanol as well as by sublimation and physical vapor transport
(PVT) methods, whereas form II was grown by slow cooling of the melt
at 190 °C. Following consolidated procedures,6 the lattice phonon spectra of the corresponding physically
pure polymorphs have been recorded as references and are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Lattice phonon Raman
spectra of forms I and II of paracetamol.

The growth of form III, the formerly elusive polymorph of
paracetamol,13,15 is more challenging. Although
it seems clear16,17 that this polymorph can be obtained
by a thermal cycle after amorphization,
a slight change of the experimental conditions as well as employing
covered or uncovered conditions17 is sufficient
to produce the other forms in the same crystallization process. An
exhaustive review of these methods is reported in the literature.7 We indeed obtained form III by slowly heating
the amorphous phase up to 85 °C18 and
letting the whole sample cool down overnight. As suggested in ref (17), though disputed in ref (18), in our case, the use
of a coverslip on the sample was crucial to selectively produce the
desired phase. The appearance of a new phonon profile in the Raman
spectrum (violet trace in Figure 2a) demonstrated the growth of the expected form III.7

Figure 2 (a) Raman spectra of the thermal cycle of amorphous paracetamol
to obtain form III (left side): the magnified spectrum at 85 °C
highlights the appearance of the bands at ca. 80 and 103 cm–1 of form III. Right side, images of the sample: (b) starting of the
nucleation of form III in the amorphous phase (no phonon structure);
(c) crystallization at 85 °C; and (d) magnified view at the polarizing
microscope of the transformation zone.

Quite interestingly, during the thermal treatment, we could
spot
the nucleation of the new phase at the center of the topmost layer
of the amorphous sample (see arrow in Figure 2b). From here, the slow crystallization of
form III started at 85 °C, triggering the transformation of the
entire sample, which was completed overnight after returning to an
ambient temperature (Figure 2c,d).

On the contrary, the amorphous sample kept at
room temperature,
that is, not subjected to the heating cycle, after 3 weeks displayed
a mixing of forms II and III (vide infra). Notably, the Raman spectra
of the polymorphs are clearly distinct in the region of the lattice
phonons, thus allowing for a quick polymorph identification, whereas
only slight differences in the energy interval of the intramolecular
vibrations are observed, confirming the unmodified molecular identity
in all phases, as shown in Figure S6. Lattice
phonon Raman spectra patterns strongly depend on sample orientation
as displayed in Figure S7, in which the
spectra recorded in different points of the sample of Figure 2 are given, and all peaks reported
in the literature8 for form III can be
found.

Further information was gathered by exploiting the confocality
of the Raman spectrometer, which enabled us to probe the phase homogeneity
of crystal domains at different sample depths.19 This was achieved by focusing the laser light with microscope
objectives having different numerical apertures (NAs). Typical values
of the theoretical penetration depths vary from 7.5
μm (100×) to 25 μm (50×), 150 μm (20×),
450 μm (10×), and about 900 μm (6.3×), although
the actual values may be considerably lower, depending on the sample
conditions. The spectra of Figure 3 are recorded on a sample in which crystallization
occurs starting from an amorphous phase. They qualitatively account
for the gradual decrease of the crystallinity on going from the surface
(form III + II, 50× and 100×) to inside the bulk (amorphous,
6.3×), as a valuable demonstration of the mechanism of surface
crystallization proposed by Wu.20

Figure 3 Effect of the
penetration depth in the sample of forms III + II
obtained from the amorphous phase. Form II is identified by the band
at 122 cm–1 (black arrow) and form III by the band
at 103 cm–1 (violet arrow). Red stars indicate peaks
of the substrate. The penetration depth increases from the top (100×)
to the bottom (6.3×). A picture of the sample is shown at the
right.

2.2 Phase
Mixing
The three known pure
phases of paracetamol were also found to display extensive phase mixing,
which could be analyzed by Raman mapping.19 Phase mixing is a common occurrence in polymorphism, with crystal
phases that may coexist on a micrometric scale as different domains
in the same crystallite, affecting the physical purity of the sample.6,8,19,21 In paracetamol, this mixing is selective because it involves form
II with either form I or III, but is never observed between forms
I and III. Typically, phase mixing between forms I and II occurs during
the slow cooling of the melt leading to the formation of form II (Figure S8). In a similar way, forms II and III
may coexist after formation of form III from the amorphous phase (Figure S9). This situation is pictured in Figure 4, where a Raman map
is used to show the spatial distribution of both phases in the vicinity
of the nucleation center of form III, triggered from the amorphous
phase. The map results are particularly useful, demonstrating that
the technique can provide a powerful and immediate visual representation
of the amount of form III, which, by heating and with time, spontaneously
transforms to form II.

Figure 4 Raman mapping (top) and microscope images (bottom) of
the phase
mixing between forms II and III on the same sample of Figure 2 after a few days of heating.
A false color palette visually identifies the spatial distribution
of either phase.

A final interesting point
to remark is the attainment of form III
by sublimation, although with the concomitant presence of form II,
a result not previously reported in the literature (Figure S10).

2.3 Growth on Substrates: Surface-Induced
Polymorphs
on Glass
Few layers of a given organic material on a suitable
substrate can show molecular organizations different from those found
in the bulk phase.22 Typical examples can
be found among organic semiconductors such as pentacene and thiophene
derivatives.5,23−26 These structures are often referred
to as surface-induced polymorphs (SIPs).

The same approach has
been applied to pharmaceutical compounds,27 successfully probing that films grown on substrates may selectively
stabilize a particular crystal phase.9,28 In particular,
paracetamol was studied as a model API system to show that the metastable
form III could be selectively stabilized in spin-coated films on silica
substrates subjected to thermal treatment.9

In this work, spin-coated samples of paracetamol were prepared
on glass substrates by following the protocol given in the literature9 with 1 wt % solutions of either ethanol or tetrahydrofuran
(THF) but without any subsequent heating. From both solutions, completely
amorphous samples were consistently obtained, which, over time, crystallized
with different kinetics and crystal morphologies. In detail, the samples
from ethanol crystallized in 1 day, whereas the THF ones could be
analyzed just after 1 h and form III was found to grow over large
areas of the film. Its stability as well as its spontaneous transformation
to II was followed spectroscopically, detecting a progressive rise
of the phonon peak at about 122 cm–1, as shown by
the arrow of Figure 5, which is the characteristic signature of form II in the film spectra,
as extensively discussed in the next section. The example given in Figure 5 refers to a sample
obtained by depositing 200 μL of THF solution, crystallized
as form III from the amorphous phase and whose process of transformation
under ambient conditions to form II was so slow that it was not fully
completed even in a time span of months. This exceptional persistence
in time of the metastable form III on glass represents an unprecedented
record of stability.

Figure 5 Lattice phonon spectra follow the process of transformation
of
form III to II in time. Example of a film obtained by deposition of
200 μL of a solution of THF 1 wt % on glass: (a) 1 week later;
(b) after 1 month; (c) after 2 months; (d) after 3 months; and (e)
after 7 months. Red stars indicate peaks of the substrate.

This result, besides its spectroscopic evidence,
has also been
confirmed by a specular XRD diffraction pattern of paracetamol on
glass, as shown in Figure S11, where only
a single peak has been observed. Here, the conclusion is twofold.
First, the peak position corresponds to paracetamol in its form III;
second, the presence of one peak only is the typical situation of
a sample strongly textured, where the crystal preferably contacts
the surface with one exclusive orientation, that is, the (001) plane,
like samples on silicon.9 In (001) texturing,
the molecules lie flat on the surface, so that the molecular contact
area with the underlying substrate is maximized.

Finally, we
should point out that the surface-mediated arrangement
so obtained is not a new polymorph, as strictly speaking a SIP would
be, but rather a metastable form with an unexpected stability in time.
Therefore, we would rather call it a surface-stabilized polymorph.

2.4 Transformation from Form III to II
Raman
spectroscopy is not only capable of efficiently following the
time evolution of form III to form II in paracetamol films but also
yields interesting hints about the different route taken by this transformation
in the films with respect to the bulk material.

When a smaller
amount of THF solution (150 μL, 1 wt %) is deposited on the
glass substrate, the film crystallizes to form III and rapidly switches
to form II after only 10 min at room temperature. Therefore, the rate
of transformation depends on the quantity of material deposited on
the substrate: the smaller the amount of material, the faster the
process.29 The reason for this may be that
the rate of the variation in the concentration and the level of supersaturation
change drastically, especially when using a fast evaporating solvent
such as THF. This might result in the formation of a distinct amorphous
phase or even of nuclei, which favors the formation of form II.

However, as seen in the left panel of Figure 6, we do not detect the direct transformation
of form III, but rather a change of its spectral features, which move
to a poorly defined profile with basically only one intense band located
at 122 cm–1. By comparison with the bulk crystal
spectra (blue trace of the same figure), even though at the very same
wavenumber, there exists a correspondence with one of the most intense
Raman-active phonons of form II, we do notice that all other phonon
bands are either fading or completely washed away. The full spectrum
of form II finally develops only at a later stage. Therefore, we are
inclined to consider the poorly defined pattern indicated by an arrow
in the figure as the signature of an intermediate state, which acts
as a precursor of form II before completely transforming into it.

Figure 6 Left side:
Transformation of form III to II in a film obtained
by deposition of 150 μL of a solution of THF 1 wt % on glass.
Right side: Polarized lattice phonon spectra of single crystals of
paracetamol of form II oriented as displayed. The definitions aa, bb, and ab = ba indicate the directions (horizontal and vertical bars)
of the polarization vector of both incident (red bars) and scattered
(dark blue bars) light with respect to the crystal axes. In the picture
of the sample, the crystal area analyzed is indicated by the yellow
dashed line.

To explain the nature
of such an intermediate state is not straightforward,
as it requires the knowledge of phonon response for each direction
of the single crystal and then the transfer of this information to
the film grown on the substrate. From a spectroscopic point of view,
this implies measuring polarized Raman spectra, in which a mutual
orientation between crystal axes and polarization of the exciting
laser field is selected, so that a specific correspondence of each
phonon band to its symmetry can be determined. Details on the machinery
of this procedure go beyond the aim of this paper and can be found
in a dedicated book.30 We recall that the
polarized Raman spectra of paracetamol can be found in the literature,31 but no data are available in the strategic lattice
phonon region.

Polarized phonon spectra of a single crystal
of form II are shown
in Figure 6 (right
panel), the caption of which schematically clarifies the geometry
of the experiment. The orientation of the single crystal under investigation
must be known to extract useful information from the data. Following
experimental reports12,29 and computational predictions,32 the needlelike single crystals lie on the (001)
or ab plane, which is also the crystal orientation
parallel to the molecular layers9,12,33,34 with a growth direction along a, that is, the direction of elongation of paracetamol molecules.29 With this in mind, we can label all spectra
following Porto’s notation, that is, we can identify the matrix
element (ij) of the polarizability tensor responsible
for the Raman scattering in each specific experimental configuration,30,35 as marked in the figure.

Relating oriented single-crystal
polarized phonons to the film
spectral features is now achievable. The spectrum of the intermediate
state, with the peak at 122 cm–1, corresponds almost
exactly to that indicated as (bb) in the single-crystal
polarized spectra. It looks as though the presumably random molecular
arrangement in the film of paracetamol molecules on top of the substrate
behaved as an ordered, organized structure when probed by exciting
and collecting light, both polarized parallel to the b-axis. However, the film is far from being a system comparable to
a single crystal. Thus, the correspondence between the two spectra
must indicate that identical profiles arise from altogether different
physical conditions.

To explain this correspondence, precise
information is needed on
how paracetamol crystal domains organize on a substrate. Ehmann and
Werzer9 report that the form II structure
grows with the (001) plane parallel to the silica surface. The same
orientation is found on glass, as seen in the previous section. Peterson
et al.36 suggest that there is only short-range
order along the a-axis, which is also the slow growth
direction in the calculated morphology.32 It is plausible that this situation along a is
maintained in the early stages of form III transformation to the intermediate
state, precursor of form II, implying, because of this disorder, a
loss of phonon phase correlation along a. Consequently,
for all spectral features whose intensity depends on the polarizability
matrix elements containing the a-axis, the phase
matching between the incoming polarized light and the corresponding
phonon mode fails. Accordingly, only those phonons marked as (bb) in Figure 6 do survive. This nicely explains why a specific polarized spectrum
of the single crystal appears coincident with that of the partially
disordered intermediate state of the film. In other words, the film
spectrum is reminiscent of that of the polarized crystal, but the
underlying physical meaning is different. We believe that the intermediate
state can be described as a partially ordered structure originating
on the surface and made of (001) layers of form II, which subsequently
propagate into the bulk in a process similar to the so-called surface
crystallization, whose mechanism proposed by Wu20 has been so convincingly demonstrated by the data in Figure 4.

2.5 Growth on Gold and Polystyrene
Spin-coated
films were also prepared on gold and polystyrene substrates from THF
solutions of the same concentration used for the depositions on glass.
Films on gold undergo a strong dewetting, so that only 100 μL
of solution could be deposited. Even in this case, form III appears
to be dominant in the lattice phonon spectra, even after warming the
sample above 100 °C. Only during the cooling process, the transformation
to form II was observed (Figure S12).

In the case of films on polystyrene, the identification of form III
as the one obtained by deposition was performed by specular XRD reflectivity
only (Figure S13).

It is once more
interesting to remark that by exploiting the complementary
Raman and XRD techniques to comply with phase recognition, we could
overcome the technical problems for which it was not always possible
to perform both structural and spectroscopic investigations at the
same time and on the very same sample.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have studied the polymorphism of the model API
system, paracetamol, by employing phase recognition lattice phonon
Raman microscopy.6 The unique relationship
between the phonon pattern (lattice dynamics) and
its corresponding XRD pattern (lattice structure)
makes Raman microscopy a powerful tool to complement information on
different crystal structures. After characterizing the three pure
forms of paracetamol, we have also analyzed their mixing as different
domains in the same crystallite. The confocality of the micro-Raman
technique allowed us to search for polymorphs in the crystal region
under investigation down to a spatial resolution below 1 μm.
We were thus able to discriminate the presence of different structures
as a function of the depth within the sample by a valuable tool, which
has demonstrated the mechanism of surface crystallization of the metastable
form III as proposed by Wu.20

An
important task of this work has been the characterization of
crystal forms of paracetamol in spin-coated films deposited on different
substrates, aiming to stabilize metastable phases as reported by Ehmann
and Werzer.9 Not only did we confirm the
high selectivity of Si/SiOx substrates
in the growth of form III but also succeeded to have it on glass,
gold, and polystyrene surfaces, finding a surprising stability in
a time scale of months.

the outcome of drop-casting and spin-coating depositions of 1 wt %
THF solutions on glass, gold, silicon, and polystyrene.

Scheme 2 Summary
of Nonsolvated Polymorphs Obtained by Deposition on Different
Substrates by Drop Casting (Drop) and Spin Coating (Spin)
Notably, the measurements of
accurate polarized spectra of phonon
modes have clarified the mechanism underlying the transformation from
form III to II. This occurs via an intermediate state consisting of
a partially disordered layered structure building up on top of the
film of form III grown on the glass surface. In the second step, the
fully ordered structure of the bulk is eventually reached.

In
conclusion, micro-Raman spectroscopy has confirmed to be a sound
technique to monitor crystal structures in the time scale of seconds,
also scanning them for physical impurities. The method can be applied
both to bulk crystals and thin films, offering a number of useful
applications in pharmaceutical science.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Sample Preparation and Crystal Growth
Crystals of paracetamol (Sigma-Aldrich, purity 98%) were grown from
solutions of methanol and ethanol, from the melt, by sublimation in
a glass tube and by PVT.37 Various polymorphs
were obtained, as specifically described in the Results
and Discussion section. Films on glass, gold, and polystyrene
surfaces were deposited by spin coating THF and ethanol solutions,
following the protocol described in the literature.9

4.2 Raman Spectra
Lattice phonon spectra
were obtained with a Horiba Jobin Yvon T64000 Raman spectrometer by
placing the sample on the optical stage of an Olympus BX40 microscope,
with a number of objectives of different NAs. Confocality allowed
us to achieve a spatial resolution below 1 μm and a theoretical field depth ranging from about 7 to 900 μm.
The wavenumber region spanned was typically 10–150 cm–1 to detect the lattice modes. The excitation wavelength was from
an ion krypton laser tuned at 647.1 nm. The incoming power was reduced
by neutral filters whose optical density was selected each time to
prevent sample damage, the actual power focused on the sample being
anyway less than 1 mW. Molecular identity was checked by simultaneously
detecting the intramolecular vibrations of the skeletal modes of paracetamol.
More details are available in the study by Brillante et al.6

4.3 DSC
DSC measurements
of the paracetamol
samples were performed using a DSC 204 F1 Phoenix calorimeter (Netzsch,
Selb, Germany). In the standard crucibles, a quantity of about 8 mg
of paracetamol was included. The measurements were performed under
an inert nitrogen atmosphere to prevent potential oxidation.

4.4 XRD
XRD experiments were performed
using an Empyrean reflectometer from PANalytical (Netherlands). The
radiation was provided by a copper sealed tube and a parallel beam
mirror. The beam is further defined by various slits prior entering
the three-dimensional pixel solid-state detector in one-dimensional
mode. For the heating of the sample, a DHS-900 (Anton-Paar GmbH, Graz,
Austria) system was used. This heating device directly allowed thin-film
samples to be measured at highly accurate temperatures. To prevent
sample degradation due to oxygen, a dome made from PEEK was used,
which was constantly flushed with helium.
