The worldwide use of the broad-spectrum
antimicrobial trimethoprim
(TMP) has induced the rise of TMP-resistant microorganisms. In addition
to resistance-causing mutations of the microbial chromosomal dihydrofolate
reductase (Dfr), the evolutionarily and structurally unrelated type
II Dfrs (DfrBs) have been identified in TMP-resistant microorganisms.
DfrBs are intrinsically TMP-resistant and allow bacterial proliferation
when the microbial chromosomal Dfr is TMP-inhibited, making these
enzymes important targets for inhibitor development. Furthermore,
DfrBs occur in multiresistance plasmids, potentially accelerating
their dissemination. We previously reported symmetrical bisbenzimidazoles
that are the first selective inhibitors of the only well-characterized
DfrB, DfrB1. Here, their diversification provides a new series of
inhibitors (Ki = 1.7–12.0 μM).
Our results reveal two prominent features: terminal carboxylates and
inhibitor length allow the establishment of essential interactions
with DfrB1. Two crystal structures demonstrate the simultaneous binding
of two inhibitor molecules in the symmetrical active site. Observations
of those dimeric inhibitors inspired the design of monomeric analogues,
binding in a single copy yet offering similar inhibition potency (Ki = 1.1 and 7.4 μM). Inhibition of a second
member of the DfrB family, DfrB4, suggests the generality of these
inhibitors. These results provide key insights into inhibition of
the highly TMP-resistant DfrBs, opening avenues to downstream development
of antibiotics for combatting this emergent source of resistance.

Introduction
Trimethoprim (TMP)
is a broad-spectrum diaminopyrimidine antimicrobial
agent (Scheme 1).1−3 The target of TMP is the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (Dfr). Dfrs
are ubiquitous and have long been primary targets for the treatment
of proliferative disorders such as cancer and infectious diseases
because they are essential for the synthesis of DNA precursors.4 Dfrs catalyze the reduction of dihydrofolate
(DHF) to tetrahydrofolate with the reducing cofactor NADPH.5 TMP specifically inhibits the bacterial chromosomal
Dfr (known as DfrA); moderate TMP resistance can result from its mutations.6

Scheme 1 Previously Reported Symmetrical Bisbenzimidazole-Type
Inhibitors
of DfrB1, 1 and 2,20 Have the General Structure (A) Central Core; (B) Phenoxy Moieties;
(C) Benzimidazole Moieties; and (D) Terminal Carboxylates
Bacteria may additionally express
an additional Dfr: an evolutionarily
unrelated type II Dfr (DfrB). DfrB1, also known as R67 DHFR, is the
best studied among the DfrB family. It is inert to millimolar concentrations
of TMP and therefore allows bacterial proliferation in the presence
of TMP that inhibits the chromosomal Dfr.7−10 DfrBs share no sequence or structural
relationship with the chromosomal Dfrs: they have evolved convergently
to catalyze the same reaction (reduction of dihydrofolate with NADPH)
yet do not bind TMP. As a result, Gram-negative bacteria harboring
a plasmid-borne DfrB are highly resistant to TMP (Figure 1).5,9,11−15 Thus, DfrBs are not targets of TMP and therefore
require independent inhibitor discovery.

Figure 1 Treatment of bacterial
infections with the antibiotic TMP selectively
inhibits the target, chromosomal Dfr, leading to bacterial cell death.
The presence of the evolutionarily unrelated type II Dfr (DfrB) in
bacteria allows bacterial proliferation due to its intrinsic resistance
to TMP.

As a result of its simple structure
and efficacy, the low-cost
TMP has been in constant and heavy use as an antibiotic worldwide
for decades.1,2,5 The
combination of TMP and sulfonamide (SUL) is broadly used against aerobic
bacteria and occasionally against protozoa.1 The World Health Organization has classified TMP–SUL as highly
important because of its effectiveness in the treatment of human urinary
and respiratory tract infections.1,2,5 The TMP–SUL combination is also a part of
the primary front-line treatment for infections of known or unknown
origin in veterinary applications1 and
is used in routine preventive measures, further increasing its distribution.
For example, TMP is heavily used in aquaculture of shrimp16 and fish,14,16 where it is disseminated
into surrounding waters. It is also widely used in livestock which
is of particular concern because resistance to TMP in livestock,17 especially cattle1 and swine,13,15 is known to be transferable to
humans.1,18 Consequently, the global incidence of TMP
resistance in humans is increasing;19 we
recently identified a dfrB gene integrated into a
multiresistance cassette in a North American TMP-resistant clinical
sample,10 highlighting the need for discovery
of DfrB inhibitors.

To date, few efforts have been made toward
the discovery of inhibitors
for DfrBs. In the DfrB family, only DfrB1 has been structurally and
kinetically characterized.20−24 In contrast to all chromosomal Dfrs (and their plasmid-borne, close
variants), including the human Dfr (hDfr), that share a conserved
monomeric fold with clearly defined substrate and cofactor binding
regions, DfrB1 is a doughnut-shaped homotetrameric enzyme with a single,
central active-site tunnel (Figure 2). Each protomer consists of an SH3-like domain that
contributes equally to the formation of the active site.7,23,25 The hourglass-shaped active-site
tunnel has a central neck that opens into the opposing tunnel mouths
(Figure 2). Its calculated
volume is greater than twice that of the Escherichia
coli DfrA active site, despite catalyzing the same
reaction.8 As a result of its symmetry,
it can bind two DHF substrate molecules, two NADPH cofactor molecules,
or one of each with positive cooperativity.26−28

Figure 2 Left: surface representation
of the tetrameric DfrB1. The substrates
NADPH and DHF, in sticks representation, are bound inside the active-site
tunnel (PDB code 2RK1).29 Right: close-up of the tunnel; only
two DfrB1 protomers are shown. The pABA-Glu tail
of DHF was not resolved as a result of its dynamic behavior;30 simulations indicate that it salt bridges with
a Lys32 (pink surface, left opening) at the flared active-site mouth,
opposite the Lys32 (pink surface, right opening) where the NADPH 2′-phosphate
forms a similar interaction.30

This unusual binding promiscuity has resulted in
DfrBs being considered
as poorly evolved enzymes and led to the identification of nonselective
inhibitors of DfrB1, some among which bind in two copies.4,8,27 2,4-Diaminopyrimidines, including
methotrexate (MTX) and aminopterin (AMT), known for decades to be
antimicrobial or antineoplastic inhibitors that target chromosomal
Dfrs,3,31,32 bind weakly
to apo-DfrB1, although no binding was observed with holo-DfrB1.3,9−15,27 Pemetrexed (PMTX), 2-desamino-5,8-dideazafolic
acid, 5,8-dideazapterin analogues, and 5-deazafolic acid analogues
nonspecifically not only inhibit DfrB1 in the low micromolar range
but also inhibit the human Dfr (hDfr) and other mammalian enzymes
from the folate pathway with higher affinity, precluding their use
as antibiotic agents.4,27,33,34 In addition, the mainly hydrophobic active-site
cavity of DfrB1 procures micromolar binding of various symmetrical
or asymmetrical polycyclic molecules including novobiocin.4,8,35

We previously reported
the first selective inhibitors of DfrB1,
obtained by a fragment-based design.20 Among
the weakly inhibiting, low molecular weight fragments that were identified,
1H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid was selected to
build symmetrical compounds that reflect the symmetry of the DfrB1
active site.20 The resulting symmetrical
bisbenzimidazoles offered competitive inhibition that was 100- to
1000-fold more efficient than the initial fragment, with Ki in the low micromolar range (Scheme 1).20 Preliminary
crystallographic results and kinetic analyses demonstrated that two
molecules of 1 bind simultaneously inside the DfrB1 tunnel.20 Despite having achieved selective inhibition,
little insight was obtained into the nature of the 2:1 inhibitor/target
interactions.

With the goal of achieving a 1:1 inhibitor/target
ratio that is
more amenable to downstream antibiotic development, we investigated
the contribution to binding of the substructures of 1 and 2: the central core, phenoxy moieties, benzimidazole
moieties, and terminal carboxylates (Scheme 1). In addition, the length of the molecule
and geometric constraints were explored to determine binding requirements.
Two crystal structures resolved with 1 or one among the
most effective; new inhibitors confirmed the previously proposed 2:1
inhibitor/target binding stoichiometry and, along with LowModeMD simulations
and steady-state kinetic analyses, provided insights into key binding
interactions. These findings inspired the design of analogues that
were confirmed to bind with 1:1 stoichiometry. We further revealed
a broader biological impact by demonstrating that a second member
of the DfrB family, identified in a North American TMP-resistant clinical
sample,10 is also effectively inhibited
by these novel bisbenzimidazole inhibitors.

Results and Discussion
Crystal
Structures Reveal Two Bound Molecules of the Inhibitor
DfrB1
is an unusual enzyme in that its four protomers assemble
to form a single, 24 Å-long active-site tunnel that bisects the
tetrameric structure (Figure 2).36 The homotetramer is thus defined
by a 222 symmetry where the center of the active site is situated
at the intersection of three axes of symmetry; the asymmetric unit
contains one-quarter of the active-site pore. In prior work, we identified 1 (Scheme 1) as a competitive inhibitor of DfrB1, with a Ki = 4.0 μM.20 Its Hill coefficient
of n = 2.1 and competitive mode of binding were consistent
with the simultaneous binding of more than one molecule of 1 within the active-site cavity. Consistent with this, we reported
preliminary crystallographic data suggesting that two molecules of 1 lie lengthwise in the tunnel.20

The particular symmetry of DfrB1 poses a challenge in the
course of analyzing electron density of ligands crystallized in the
active site. It has been previously shown29 that ligand binding typically breaks the crystallographic symmetry
of the DfrB1 tunnel, either upon binding the substrates NADPH and
DHF (PDB ID: 2RK1(29)) or by binding a ligand that is asymmetric
or whose symmetry does not coincide with the crystallographic symmetry
axis (PDB ID: 2RK2).29 The electron density observed in
the asymmetric unit is the average density over the four symmetric
quarters of the active site. This renders interpretation of the electron
density difficult, particularly in cases with low ligand occupancy.

To gain further insights into the mode of inhibitor binding, we
synthesized 3 that bears an asymmetric central core (Figure 3; Scheme S1; detailed synthetic methods are provided in the Supporting Information). Inhibition (Ki = 3.5 μM) is essentially unchanged from
that of 1 (Ki = 4.0 μM)
and both are selective, as no inhibition of human Dfr (hDfr) was observed
(Table 1). We obtained
a crystal structure of DfrB1 in complex with 3, which
we report here along with the completed analysis of the crystal structure
of 1 (Table S1). In both structures,
two molecules of the soaked inhibitor are juxtaposed within the tetrameric
active site, in an extended conformation (Figure 3). Only the 1,3-dioxopropan-2-ol or 1,4-dioxobutan-2-ol
central cores could be resolved; they lie in the central neck of the
tunnel. The quality of the electron density decreased toward the benzimidazole
extremities, in the direction of the active-site mouths. This is analogous
to the DfrB1:DHF crystal structure, where only the pteridin moiety
was resolved in the center of the active site29 as a result of the dynamic behavior of its pABA-Glu tail21,30 and is suggestive of a similar binding mode.

Figure 3 Crystal structures of
DfrB1 (A) with inhibitor 1 PDB
ID 6NY0 and
(B) with inhibitor 3 PDB ID 6NXZ. Because of the ambiguity of the electron
density in the asymmetric unit, we were unable to definitely assign
one enantiomer of the racemic central core of 3. We modeled
the R-enantiomer in the active site, for further analysis. As the
binding modes of 1 and 3 are slightly offset
from the center of symmetry, they are observed in two slightly different
binding modes when the asymmetric unit is expanded to show the tetramer.
The inhibitors were modeled at 0.5 occupancy per asymmetric unit.
This approximated two fully occupied binding sites in the tetrameric
active-site tunnel.

In our initial analysis of
the crystal structure of 1 in complex of DfrB1,20 the data were
not sufficient for us to confidently conclude that the density could
be definitively modeled as 1. We observe very similar
electron density in the complex with the chemically similar 3; this density was visible only when inhibitor soaking was
performed. Given these results, combined with prior reports of ligand-bound
DfrB1 structures,29 we are now confident
in modeling 1 and 3 in these crystal structures.

In Silico Reconstruction of the Network of Interactions that
Describe Inhibitor Binding
To model the missing portion of
the bound inhibitors, we built the cocrystallized inhibitor molecules
outward from the central core coordinates and performed LowModeMD
(Molecular Operating Environment). The crystal structure with 3 (PDB ID 6NXZ) was selected as a template for building all other inhibitors, reserving
the crystal structure with 1 to validate the models.
Throughout the hundreds of simulated poses obtained for the full-length
modeled inhibitors, the two molecules of 3 consistently
adopted a helical conformation along the length of the active-site
tunnel (Figure 4).
During most of the simulation, the terminal carboxylates formed electrostatic
bonds with the ε-amino of either of the two Lys32 at each tunnel
mouth and established H-bonds with the backbone of the nearby Gly35
and Ala36 (Figures 4; S1; Tables S2 and S3). We refer to this predominant bonding pattern as the “Lys32
network”. On some occasions, the terminal carboxylates of 3 also H-bonded with the hydroxyl of Ser34. Alternatively,
the terminal carboxylates interacted with the hydroxyl of two out
of the three following residues: Tyr46, Thr48, and Thr51, which we
will refer to as the “YTT cluster” (Figure 4). This confirms the dynamic
binding of the inhibitor extremities, which is consistent with the
lack of clear electron density in the complexed crystal structures.
The benzimidazole moieties of 3 established multiple
interactions with Val66, Gln67, Ile68, and Tyr69: the amine H-bonded
with the backbone carbonyl of Val66, and the phenyl and imidazole
rings formed intermittent π-hydrogen bonds or edge-to-face aromatic
interactions with the Val66 backbone amine and Tyr69, respectively
(Figure 4; Tables S2 and S3). The benzimidazole moiety,
phenoxy moiety, and central core made multiple H-bonds with Gln67
and Ile68. Occasionally, the benzenes from the phenoxy moieties of 3 formed π-hydrogen bonds with the backbone amine of
Ile68. Finally, the central core hydroxyl established H-bonding interactions
with the side-chain amide of Gln67, as observed in the cocrystal structure.

reconstruction of 3 in the active site of
DfrB1 based on the crystal structure PDB ID 6NXZ. Interactions of
DfrB1 with 3 are highlighted.

Geometry of Inhibitor Binding is Orthogonal to that of the Bound
Substrates
DfrB is a dimer of dimers: monomers assemble into
dimers by one set of contacts, and dimers assemble into a 222 symmetric
homotetramer by a distinct set of contacts, resulting in two distinct
types of dimer interfaces. The symmetry dictates that the ligand-binding
surface provided in quadrants I/II (see Figure 5) is equivalent to that created in quadrants
III/IV and that these are distinct from the ligand-binding surface
provided in quadrants I/IV and II/III (themselves equivalent). During
the catalytic cycle, positive cooperativity favors binding of DHF
onto the NADPH-bound DfrB1 (holo-DfrB1) to form the productive (DfrB1·NADPH·DHF)
complex. NADPH binding (quadrants I and II) is thus followed by the
binding of DHF (quadrants III and IV) according to an ordered mechanism
of the ternary complex formation (Figure 5).37 Naturally,
the active-site symmetry allows binding in the opposite quadrants
(NADPH in quadrants III/IV and DHF in I/II). The active site can also
accommodate the binding
of two DHF or two NADPH molecules,27,28,30,37 illustrating its promiscuity;
binding occurs in the same mode (quadrants I/II and III/IV).

Figure 5 Substrate-binding
surfaces of DfrB1 in quadrants I/II and III/IV,
identical to each other, are occupied by the substrates NADPH and
DHF (PDB ID 2RK1;28 left panel). The distinct inhibitor-binding
surfaces in quadrants I/IV and II/III, identical to each other, are
occupied by the central core of a pair of 3 molecules
(PDB ID 6NXZ; right panel). As each of the inhibitor-binding surfaces partially
occludes both of the substrate-binding surfaces, neither substrate-binding
site is accessible with the inhibitor bound surface. This provides
strong evidence that binding of DHF is incompatible with binding of
one molecule of 3 (overlay, center panel).

Figure 6 Inhibitors 4–7 and 10 and 11. Central core substitution relative to 1 and 2 is shown.

The crystal structure of DfrB1·3 demonstrates
that 3 binds with a geometry orthogonal to that of the
substrates: quadrants I/IV and II/III are occupied by either of the
bound inhibitor molecules (Figure 5). As a result of this orthogonal binding mode, binding
of an inhibitor molecule is incompatible with binding of NADPH or
DHF because of steric hindrance (Figure 5). Despite the orthogonal binding geometry
of the substrates and inhibitor and despite their structural differences,
it is remarkable that the substrates and 3 share key
binding residues: Lys32, Ala36, Tyr46, Thr51, Val66, Gln67, Ile68,
and Tyr69. Among these, Lys32, Gln67, lle68, and Tyr69 are functional
residues, justifying the inhibitory effect of 3.

In Silico
Reconstruction of the Network of Interactions with
Inhibitors 1 and 2
We used the
model of DfrB1·3 as a template to predict binding
interactions with 1 and 2. One molecule
of 3 was replaced by a first molecule of the query inhibitor
and a first LowModeMD simulation was performed. Substitution of the
second molecule of 3 by the second molecule of 1 or 2 was then followed by a second LowModeMD
simulation. A root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 2.4 ± 0.6
Å between the eight atoms constituting the 1,3-dioxopropan-2-ol
core of 1 in the crystal structure (PDB ID 6NY0) and the ensemble
of nearly 3000 simulated conformers obtained validated the model.

The interaction pattern observed for 1 and 2 throughout the hundreds of simulated poses was similar to that observed
for 3 (summarized in Tables S2 and S3; Figure S1). Again, the terminal
carboxylates formed frequent electrostatic and H-bonds with the Lys32
network and less frequently H-bonded with the YTT cluster, particularly
for 2. The benzimidazoles again established bonds with
Val66, Ile68, and Tyr69 but lost the H-bond with the Gln67 side chain.
The phenoxy oxygens of 1 bind the Gln67 γ-amide
as well as the Ile68 backbone-NH while those of 2 are
bound instead to the Val66 backbone-NH. In addition to π-hydrogen
bonding with the Ile68 backbone-NH, the phenoxy benzenes of 1 formed a novel edge-to-face interaction with Tyr69. The
central core of 3 is bound similarly to 1, but the pentyl central core of 2 lacks that H-bonding
capacity. These models indicate that the four segments generally contribute
to inhibitor binding, yet some variation is tolerated without compromising
affinity.

Does Inhibitor Length Matter?
The bound crystal structures
and simulations indicate that inhibitors 1–3 bind
lengthwise within the active-site tunnel in a helical conformation
and their carboxylates interact alternatively with the Lys32 network
or the YTT cluster at both tunnel mouths. The location of these binding
hotspots suggests that inhibitor length may play a role in allowing
establishment of contacts. To verify the effect of central core length
on affinity, central cores from 2 to 12 methylene units in length
(4 to 9) were synthesized and assayed (Figure 6, Table 1, and Scheme S1). Inhibition was observed in the low micromolar range for
compounds with central cores of up to eight methylene units (4 to 7) (≤36.1 Å; Table 1), but none was observed above
this length (8 and 9; Table 1).

As with 2, the alkyl
central cores of 4 to 7 cannot establish
electrostatic interactions. LowModeMD simulations with 4 to 7 showed that, as the length of the central core
increased, the terminal carboxylates are bound to the Lys32 network
more frequently than to the YTT cluster (Table S2). Interactions of their benzimidazole moieties were comparable
to those observed with 3 (Tables S2 and S3). The phenoxy oxygens and phenyls of 4 and 6 formed interactions with the same amino acids
as 3. In addition, the phenoxy oxygens and phenyls of 5 are bound to Val66 and Ile68 backbone-NHs. In contrast,
the (CH2)8 central core of 7 prevented
interactions of the phenoxy ring with DfrB1. The sole remaining interaction
was the π-hydrogen bond with the Ile68 backbone-NH. Increasing
hydrophobicity of the longest central cores (>(CH2)8, or >36 Å) reduced solubility, limiting the concentrations
that could be assayed; nonetheless, it was possible to determine that
they procured no inhibition at concentrations where shorter analogues
clearly did. As a result, 36 Å was considered the maximal length
for the design of further bisbenzimidazole-type compounds.

Central
Core Substitution
The H-bonding established
between the hydroxylated central core of 1 and 3 and the active site suggested that the central core was
a target for diversification. Substitution with a rigid (trans-2-butene; 10) or a bulky (phenyl; 11)
moiety (Table 1; Scheme S1) procured inhibition similar to 1 (Table 1).
Consistent with the good affinity of 2 and 4–7, which all bear an alkyl central core, this demonstrates that H-bonding
in the central core is not a key to affinity. Selectivity was maintained,
as 10 and 11 did not inhibit hDfr.

LowModeMD simulations with 10 showed no new interactions
with its rigidified central core. However, the core modified interactions
of the benzimidazole moieties, which no longer interacted with the
Val66 backbone but established a π-hydrogen bond with the Ile68
backbone instead (Tables S2 and S3). The
terminal carboxylates of 10 still H-bonded principally
with the Lys32 network and alternatively with the YTT cluster, with
the exception of Thr48.

The rigid phenyl central core of 11 established π-hydrogen
bonds with the backbone-NHs of Val66 and Ile68; the former also H-bonded
with the phenoxy oxygen, rather than the benzimidazole seen with 3, because of a slight reorganization. Our results demonstrate
that rigidification of the central core is tolerated and suggests
that further chemical diversification of the core is possible.

Contribution
of the Benzimidazole Moieties and Conformational
Freedom of the Carboxylates
In our previous report,20 inhibition was lost when the benzimidazole moieties
were removed from 2. Loss of inhibition may result from
the removal of key functional groups or from shortening the molecule.
To verify this, analogues lacking benzimidazole moieties and of central
core length varying from (CH2)6 to (CH2)12 (12 to 15)38 were assayed (Figure 7; Table 2). Only 14 demonstrated detectable inhibition of DfrB1.
The length of 14 (26.9 Å; Ki = 8.8 μM) is slightly less than that of the shortest
bisbenzimidazole inhibitor of Table 1, 4 (28.9 Å; Ki = 4.9 μM), clearly illustrating that removal of the
benzimidazoles does not necessarily abolish binding. Longer analogues
lacking benzimidazoles could not be assayed because of insufficient
solubility. No inhibition was observed with further analogues lacking
benzimidazoles where additional length was built in between the phenoxy
groups and terminal carboxylates (16 and 17) (Figure 7; Table 2; Scheme S2). Our results are consistent with the benzimidazole
moieties contributing to binding, as modeled by LowModeMD of 4, yet demonstrate that they are not critical components of
DfrB1 inhibitors (Tables S2 and S3).

Substitution
of the benzimidazoles with 2-naphthoic acid (18) (Figure 7; Table 2; Scheme S2) abolished inhibition. Benzimidazole
had been identified as a weak inhibitor of DfrB1 through a fragment-based
design, as had 2-naphthoic acid.20 Our
result demonstrates that in the context of these disubstituted symmetrical
molecules, their contribution to binding is not equivalent. The structural
analogy of benzimidazole to the adenine moiety of NADPH could be thought
to form the basis for its interactions with DfrB1; the adenine moiety
is involved in binding, as its removal decreases the affinity of NADPH.27 However, the adenine moiety in the holoenzyme
(PDB ID 2RK1) is solvent exposed, establishing no interactions with DfrB1. Notwithstanding
that ambiguity, our observations establish that the benzimidazole
moieties are significant contributors to DfrB1 inhibition. LowModeMD
performed with 14 found interactions similar to those
determined above, although the terminal carboxylates formed H-bonds
more frequently with the YTT cluster than with the Lys32 network (Tables S2 and S3). In this sole case, no H-bonding
was observed between the terminal carboxylates and Gly35 backbone-NH.
Finally, the phenoxy moieties made π-hydrogen bonds with the
Ser65 β-methylene, Val66 backbone amine, and aromatic C–H
of Tyr69, differing somewhat from other inhibitors.

Substitution
of the Phenoxy Moieties
We investigated
the impact of the phenoxy moieties on binding by modulating their
geometric constraints relative to the benzimidazole moieties. The p-orientation of 1 was modified to a m-orientation in 19 (Figure 8; Scheme S3).
Despite the m-configuration reflecting the geometry
of the flared edges of the active-site tunnel, inhibition decreased
(3-fold greater Ki) (Table 3). Simulations suggested the
conservation of the intertwined helical conformation of the 2 bound
molecules of 19. However, the m-configuration
abrogated H-bonding of the benzimidazole amines with the Val66 carbonyl
(Tables S2 and S3). Instead, the benzimidazole
amines H-bonded with Ile68. The benzimidazole rings interacted through
π-hydrogen bonds with the β-carbon hydrogen of Ser65 and
the Val66 backbone-NH. Nearly all binding contacts of the phenoxy
moieties were abolished; only the phenoxy oxygen H-bond with the Ile68
backbone-NH was maintained. The altered bonding may be reflected in the loss of affinity of 19 relative
to 1.

Addition of halogens may enhance
affinity with a target.39,40 Bromination of the
phenoxy ring was undertaken in an attempt to
complement the large hydrophobic active site of DfrB1. A slight improvement
of affinity was observed upon bromination of 3 (Ki = 3.5 μM) to yield 20b (Ki = 2.6 μM) (Figure 8; Table 3; Scheme S4). Furthermore,
bromination of an analogue of 2 with a shorter central
core to yield 21 (Figure 8; Scheme S5) also resulted
in good affinity (Ki = 1.7 μM; Table 3). LowModeMD simulations
of 20b and 21 suggest a H-bonding pattern
similar to those of 2 and 3 (Tables S2 and S3), where the H-bonds involving
the phenoxy oxygens were substituted by halogen bonding. The phenoxy
segment of 20b formed electrostatic interactions between
the bromine electropositive σ-hole and oxygen lone pair electrons
of the Val66 carbonyl and Gln67 side-chain carbonyl. The bromine electropositive
σ-hole in 21 created electrostatic interactions
with the oxygen lone pair electrons of the Val66 and Ile68 carbonyls
and Ser65 hydroxyl. Although those newly formed interactions did not
significantly improve affinity, our results demonstrate the tolerance
of DfrB1 to brominated inhibitors.

Substituting the Terminal
Carboxylates
All simulations
presented above predicted that electrostatic interactions of the terminal
carboxylates with the Lys32 network were predominant (Tables S2 and S3). In an effort to design compounds
that would obviate potential issues associated with carboxylates within
pharmacophores,7 we explored alternative
terminal substituents by converting these acids into a series of amides
(22 to 30; Figure 9, Schemes S4 and S5). The introduction of neutral moieties at this position, with or
without H-bonding substituents, was an effort to gain insights into
the structural requirements at the termini. Their poor solubility
precluded testing at concentrations greater than 50–100 μM,
as indicated (Table S4). No inhibition
was observed, supporting the hypothesis that the terminal carboxylates
play a crucial role in binding to DfrB1. Despite their shortcomings
within pharmacophores, they prove to be difficult to substitute in
this context.

Reducing Entropic Cost by Binding One Molecule
of Inhibitor
per Active Site
Enzyme kinetics with 1(20) and crystallography with 3 demonstrated
that two molecules of inhibitor simultaneously occupy the DfrB1 active-site
tunnel. In an attempt to reduce entropic cost of binding a dimer of
bisbenzimidazole inhibitors, we designed a tetrabenzimidazole analogue 31 (Table 4; Scheme S6). It is expected to display
similar binding enthalpy and should reduce entropic cost by binding
as a single copy. The inhibition potency of 31 was slightly
improved (Ki 2- to 12-fold lower than
the best inhibitors). A Hill coefficient of 1.1 ± 0.4 was determined,
confirming the desired 1:1 binding stoichiometry (Figure 10A). Its methyl ester analogue, 32, did not inhibit, reinforcing the essential nature of the
terminal carboxylates (Table S5).

b Ki was
calculated from IC50 values.

Repeated attempts at crystallization of DfrB1 with 31 were unsuccessful. LowModeMD was executed with 31 (Figure 10B; Tables S2 and S3). Electrostatic interactions,
hydrogen, and π-hydrogen bonding were all similar to those observed
with 3, apart from the congested quaternary central core.
Only one weak H-bond was modeled between a core methylene of 31 and the γ-amide oxygen of Gln67.

A second strategy
to improve entropic cost albeit with lower molecular
weight than 31 involved nonsymmetrical phenoxybenzimidazole-based
compounds 34–38, 39a, and 40–48 (Figure 11; Tables S6 and S7; Schemes S5, S7 and S8). They include the benzimidazole and phenoxy
moieties that procure affinity (Tables 2 and 3) and take advantage of
the tolerance to bromination and to modification of the central core
moiety (Table 1). However,
none inhibited DfrB1 at the highest concentration where they were
soluble (30–2500 μM; Tables S6 and S7).

Figure 11 Representative nonsymmetrical compounds 37, 40, 43, and 48.
The terminal carboxylates,
phenoxy moiety, and core were substituted. Four compounds among the
15 synthesized and assayed are shown. None among the 15 nonsymmetrical
compounds inhibited DfrB1 (Tables S6 and S7).

Pursuing efforts to improve the
entropic cost with a lower molecular
weight, we designed a V-shaped analogue of 11 based on
an o-substituted central phenyl core (33) (Scheme S1). This configuration imitates half
of 31 and was designed to fill half of the active-site
tunnel and competitively prevent DfrB1 activity. Binding a single
molecule of 33 should reduce the entropic cost yet it
would suffer from lower binding enthalpy due to loss of contacts.
Upon verification, V-shaped 33 lost little affinity (Ki = 7.4 μM, 2-fold weaker than 1) which was surprisingly similar to the affinity of its linear, p-substituted
analogue, 11 (Ki = 6.1 μM).
The Hill coefficient of 1.1 ± 0.1 confirmed the desired 1:1 binding
stoichiometry of 33 (Figure 12). Inhibitor 33 was selective,
displaying no inhibition of hDfr (Table 4).

as the mean ± standard deviation for triplicate results. Inset:
Hill plot of panel (A). The Hill coefficient is 1.1 ± 0.1. (B)
In silico reconstruction of 33 in the active site of
DfrB1 (left) and from a top view (right).

The Dixon plot analysis of the inhibition of DfrB1 with 33 at varying NADPH concentrations and saturating DHF demonstrated
that binding of 33 is competitive with respect to NADPH
binding (Figure S2). In contrast, the Dixon
analysis upon varying DHF concentrations with saturating NADPH did
not reflect a classical form of inhibition (Figure S2). Uncompetitive inhibition is expected to produce parallel
lines with a nonzero slope, whereas noncompetitive inhibition gives
intersecting lines with an x-intercept of −Ki,41 neither of which
corresponds to the observed pattern of nearly horizontal lines when
varying DHF. This demonstrates that saturating NADPH precluded binding
of subsaturating concentrations of 33. The preferential
binding of NADPH on the apo-DfrB1 (Kd1 = 2.5 μM) relative to DHF (Kd1 = 120 μM) justifies the greater impact of NADPH than DHF on
binding of 33.37

LowModeMD
simulations are consistent with one molecule of 33 preventing
binding of NADPH or DHF to DfrB1 by occupying
the active-site tunnel (Figure 12; Tables S2 and S3). As
a result of its o-substituted central core, V-shaped 33 adopted an elongated, heavily twisted conformation, precluding simultaneous
binding of two molecules of 33 (Figure S3). Because a single molecule of 33 was bound,
the frequency of contacts predicted between 33 and DfrB1
is lower than other inhibitors: all other simulations included four
terminal carboxylates, either because two molecules were bound simultaneously
or a single, 4-armed molecule (31) was bound (Tables S2 and S3). Nonetheless, the Ki of 33 (7.4 μM) remains on the same
order of magnitude as the best inhibitors (1.1 to 2.6 μM), demonstrating
that potency is essentially maintained. The nature of the interactions
was the same as that for 3 except near their central
cores because the phenyl core of 33 established π-hydrogen
bonds with the alkyl side chains of Gln67 and the Tyr69 hydroxyl.
These weak interactions were not sufficient to improve the affinity
of 33.

Benzimidazole-Based Inhibitors Are Not Aggregators
Various observations allow us to demonstrate that the DfrB1 inhibitors
are not aggregation-based inhibitors.42 First, we have demonstrated selectivity, where DfrB1 inhibitors
that are active between 1 and 10 μM do not significantly reduce
the hDfr activity at concentrations that are 10- to 100-fold greater
(Tables 1, 3 and 4). Second, inhibition
curves displayed steepness consistent with soluble behavior (Figures 10A and 12A), rather than the unusually steep pitch associated
with aggregation-based inhibition. Third, the competitive mode of
inhibition determined by observation of the bound crystal structures
with 1(20) or 3, and kinetics with 1(20) or 33, is not a characteristic of aggregators.42

DfrB1 Inhibitors Also Inhibit the Clinically
Identified, TMP-Resistant
Homologue DfrB4
We previously identified the DfrB4 coding
sequence, flanked by further antibiotic resistance genes, in a TMP-resistant
North American clinical sample.10 We further
demonstrated that expression of DfrB4 in E. coli conferred complete resistance to the highest concentration of TMP
that could be dissolved in the medium (600 μg/mL).10 DfrB4 shares 77% amino acid identity with DfrB1; the catalytic core
is highly conserved, whereas the loops and termini differ.21,30,36,43 The key residues of DfrB1 responsible for binding the benzimidazole-type
inhibitors, namely, the Lys32 network, YTT cluster, and active-site
residues, are conserved in DfrB4, suggesting that DfrB4 may be inhibited
by the same compounds. Here, we verified whether inhibitors of DfrB1
also inhibit DfrB4.

DfrB4 has not been biochemically characterized.
We first confirmed that DfrB4 possesses the Dfr activity. Its kinetic
parameters KMNADPH and kcat were
similar to those of DfrB1, and KMDHF of DfrB4 was threefold greater
(Table 5). Both DfrB1
and DfrB4 exhibit impressively high resistance to TMP (Table 5).27 Both DfrBs have a catalytic efficiency of ≈100-fold lower
than E. coli chromosomal Dfr; although
inefficient, this is sufficient to ensure bacterial host survival
in the presence of TMP.28

Five efficient DfrB1
inhibitors (1, 3, 33, 20b, and 31), representing
different features, were assayed for inhibition of DfrB4 (Table 5). The Ki values were similar for both DfrBs (1.1- to 1.7-fold difference).
Thus, both DfrBs are similarly inhibited by the simplest inhibitors, 1 and 3, and by V-shaped 33, tolerate
bromination of the phenoxy moiety (20b), and accept the
bulky tetrabenzimidazole-based 31.

The sequence
differences between DfrB1 and DfrB4 have no significant
impact on their catalytic activity, TMP resistance, or capacity to
be inhibited by the benzimidazole-based compounds tested here. Importantly,
this immediately suggests that the inhibitors reported here also inhibit
all other known members of the DfrB family, as they share 77–99%
of protein sequence identity.10

Conclusions
Our report has uncovered several features that contribute significantly
to the inhibition of DfrB1. The inclusion of terminal carboxylates
is a key feature, as their substitution abolished inhibition. The
carboxylates establish frequent hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions
with either the Lys32 network or the YTT cluster. The length of the
inhibitor is a second key feature, to allow the above interactions
to be established at both mouths of the active-site tunnel simultaneously.
A third feature is the contribution of the benzimidazoles: although
not crucial to binding, their impact is significant. A final feature
is packing within the large, symmetrical active site: simultaneous
binding of two linear bisbenzimidazole inhibitors could be substituted
with one tetrabenzimidazole inhibitor (31), or, with
little loss of affinity, by a single V-shaped bisbenzimidazole inhibitor
(33) that was modeled in a twisted conformation. The
weak contacts between the o-substituted central core of 33 and DfrB1 reveal its potential for future optimization. We have
thus validated a series of features characterizing benzimidazole-based
inhibitors that selectively inhibit the highly TMP-resistant DfrB1
and DfrB4 without affecting hDfr. We envision the future development
of DfrB inhibitors as a dual inhibitor system, where anti-DfrB antibiotics
would be coadministered with TMP, to inhibit both DfrBs and the bacterial
chromosomal DfrAs in parallel.

Purification of DfrB1 and
DfrB4 for Kinetic Characterization
Histidine-tagged DfrB1
and DfrB4 (using previously reported constructs
WT R67 DHFR pQE3228 and His6-DfrB4,10 respectively) were overexpressed
and purified as described previously4,20 with the following
modifications. The cell culture volume was 400 mL. During purification
on His-Trap HP,4 the imidazole concentration
for the plateau was 0.2 M and the elution concentration was 0.5 M.
Fractions containing DfrB were identified according to activity assay
and analysis on tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)46 and then concentrated
using an Amicon concentrator (MWCO 3000, Millipore) for application
on a Superose 12 column (1.6 cm × 55 cm) pre-equilibrated with
0.05 M potassium phosphate, pH 8.0. Fractions containing DfrB were
identified as above. Sample purity was determined by tricine SDS-PAGE.
The concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA).

Purification of the Human Dihydrofolate Reductase
(hDfr)
Overexpression of the hexahistidine-tagged human Dfr
(WT His6-hDHFR) and cell lysis was described previously.47 The lysate was applied on a 5 mL nickel-affinity
column (GE Healthcare) with an ÅKTA fast-protein liquid chromatography
system (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.5 mL/min. The column was washed
with 5 column volumes (CV) of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH
8.0) at 1 mL/min. A stepwise gradient of 0.1 M potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 8.0) containing increasing concentrations of imidazole
(0.02, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.16 and 0.2 M; 2 CV per concentration)
was applied. Fractions containing WT His6-hDHFR were identified
according to the standard spectrophotometric DHFR activity assay and
analysis on SDS-PAGE. Pooled fractions were concentrated using an
Amicon concentrator (MWCO 10 000, Millipore) and further purified
on a pre-equilibrated Superose 12 column (1.6 cm × 55 cm) with
0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Fractions containing His6-hDHFR were identified as above. The His6-hDHFR
concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay.

Construction
of the DfrB1 Variant for Crystallization Purposes
To enable
removal of the N-terminal 6-histidine tag from DfrB1
following its purification, we inserted an enterokinase cleavage site
(DDDDK) into the construct WT R67 DHFR pQE32.28 A forward oligonucleotide primer (5′-CATGGATCCAAGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGTATTCCCATCGGACGCCAC-3′);
Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON) was designed to include the protease
cleavage site (bold) and the DfrB1 sequence beginning at Val17, the
probable chymotrypsin cleavage site, with the BamHI restriction site. A reverse primer removed the 13-residue C-terminal
tail (ELGTPGRPAAKLN) that was previously introduced for other purposes28 and HindIII (underlined): 5′-GGGAAGCTTTTAGTTGATGCGTTCAAGCGCC-3′. The PCR product
obtained with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific
(Waltham, MA, USA)) was digested with BamHI and HindIII, isolated on agarose gel, and extracted according
to the “EZ-10 Spin Column PCR Products Purification Kit”
protocol (Bio Basic, Burlington, ON, Canada). The insert was ligated
to BamHI and HindIII-digested and
dephosphorylated (FastAP Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase, 30
min) pQE32 (Qiagen) with the DNA Ligation Kit Ver.2.1 (Takara, USA).
After 30 min at 16 °C, the DNA ligation solutions were transformed
into DH5α. DNA sequencing confirmed the expected construct DfrB1-His6V17Δ16/ENTK-pQE32. The DfrB1-His6V17Δ16/ENTK-pQE32 was transformed
into E. coli BL21 pRep4 (Qiagen) for
expression.

Purification and Crystallization of DfrB1
Soaked with 1
To crystallize DfrB1 in complex
with 1, an identical protein expression and purification
protocol was employed
as described in ref (24). Following expression and purification, the INSF tandem dimer, as
previously described,24 was concentrated
to 20 mg/mL in 100 mM Tris pH 8.0. Immediately before crystallization,
chymotrypsin was added to the sample in a ratio of 1:100 chymotrypsin/INSF,
and the protein was diluted to 15 mg/mL using MPD, resulting in a
final MPD concentration of 25%. Reservoirs were prepared using 750
μL of 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 and 60% MPD in a Greiner
24-well hanging-drop crystallization plate. On a siliconized glass
cover slip (Hampton Research), 1.5 μL of protein was combined
with 2.5 μL of reservoir solution and suspended over the well.
The plate was incubated at 277 K, and crystals were obtained in a
few days. Drops were soaked with 0.2 μL of a solution of 1 in 100% DMSO for a final concentration of 2 mM of 1.

Purification of the DfrB1 Variant for Crystallization
Purposes
The crystallization variant DfrB1 (DfrB1-His6V17Δ16/ENTK)
was overexpressed and purified as previously described,4,20 with the modifications noted above for DfrB1 and DfrB4. DfrB1-His6V17Δ16/ENTK was concentrated to 2 mg/mL (24 mg in total)
with an Amicon concentrator (MWCO 3000, Millipore), and it was incubated
with enterokinase (13 U) for 20 h at 22 °C. The sample was concentrated
and further purified on Superose 12 as described above, except that
the column was linked at the bottom to His-Trap HP cartridge pre-equilibrated
with 0.05 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0. This last step allows removal
of uncleaved DfrB1-His6V17Δ16/ENTK. Fractions containing
DfrB1 were identified and the purity was determined as above. The protein was concentrated with 0.05 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0–13.3
mg/mL for crystallization.

Crystallization of DfrB1-His6V17Δ16/ENTK was performed as previously described.29 Briefly, the protein concentration was adjusted
from 13.3 to 10 mg/mL by addition of a final concentration of 25%
MPD. Crystals were obtained using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion
method in a Greiner 24-well hanging-drop crystallization plate. Reservoirs
were prepared in Eppendorf tubes with 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0 55% MPD.
On a siliconized glass cover slip (Hampton Research), 2.0 μL
of protein solution was combined with 2.0 μL of the reservoir
solution. The plate was incubated at 277 K, and crystals were obtained
after 3–4 days. Drops were soaked with 0.4 μL of a solution
of 3 in 100% DMSO for a final concentration of 12 mM
of 3 five days prior to crystal harvest.

Data were
collected under standard cryogenic conditions using a
Rigaku MicroMax-007HF generator equipped with Varimax HF optics and
a Saturn 944+ CCD detector. The data were processed using HKL-2000
(Table S1).48 The integrated and scaled data were imported into the CCP4 software
suite.49 Iterative rounds of positional
and B-factor refinement using Refmac50 and
manual model building using Coot51 were
then performed, using the coordinates from PDB ID 3SFM with all solvent
and ligands removed24 as the starting model.
As the 3SFM structure was crystallized in the same space group and
with the same cell dimensions, care was taken to ensure that the same
reflections were included in the Rfree test set. During the late stages of refinement, anisotropic B-factor
refinement was introduced, and ligand and solvent molecules were incorporated
into the model. Coordinates and structure factors were deposited to
the PDB as PDB ID 6NXZ.

Kinetic Studies
For all kinetic assays, pH of solutions
was 7. IC50 and Ki values were
determined as previously described4,20 except that
the reaction volume was 100 μL. The assays were conducted in
Corning 96-well flat-bottomed polystyrene plates [Thermo Scientific
(Waltham, MA, USA)]. Initial rates (first 15% of substrate consumption)
were collected with a Beckman DTX 880 plate reader integrated with
a Biomek NX automated liquid handling workstation (Beckman Coulter,
Brea, CA). The length of compounds (4 to 9 and 12 to 18) was calculated with ChemDraw
3D (ChemOffice 2017, PerkinElmer Informatics). KMNADPH, KMDHF, and kcat was determined as previously described.4

Building Small Molecule Input Database and
Initial Pose Generation
All studied molecules were sketched
in ChemDraw Professional 16.
All atomistic 3D coordinates at pH7 were generated using the Database
Wash application in MOE2018.52 We generated
the DfrB1·(3)2 based on the 1,4-dioxobutan-2-ol
central core of the crystal structure PDB ID 6NXZ as the starting
point. The structure was prepared using the QuickPrep application
with default parameters. The two molecules of 3 were
built simultaneously in a stepwise manner using a standard structure-based
drug design workflow. The generated DfrB1·(3)2 complex was used as the input structure to dock all remaining
molecules.

Building Models of Protein·Inhibitor
Complexes
Docking of inhibitors was performed using the Dock
application in
MOE2018.52 One molecule of 3 was replaced by a first molecule of the query inhibitor. Substitution
of the second molecule of 3 by the second molecule of
inhibitor followed. The final dimer complex was assembled from each
docking run based on the best rmsd compared to 3. As
per the Placement Method, the Triangle Matcher was used with 30 retained
poses based on London dG scoring. Refinement was done in the rigid
receptor mode, and the best 10 poses from the GBVI/WSA dG scoring
function were written to the output database.

Conformational Exploration
of Ligand Dimers in the Tunnel
Conformational exploration
of each inhibitor molecule bound to
DfrB1 was performed using the LowModeMD method53 in MOE2018.52 All inhibitor
atoms were kept free while receptor atoms within the active-site tunnel
(all residues 4.5 Å from inhibitor molecules) were tethered with
10 kcal/mol starting from 0.25 Å deviation around the original
coordinates. All residues 4.5 Å from the tethered atoms were
fixed, and the rest of the system was set to inert. The Amber10:EHT
forcefield was used for LowModeMD with R-Field solvation. The exploration
was stopped after 10 000 conformations or after 100 consecutive
conformations already present in the database. All conformations with
an energy difference of 100 kcal/mol compared to the lowest energy
conformation were retained.

rmsd Calculated for 1
To profile the similarity
between the position of 1 in our simulation and in the
crystal structure, rmsds were calculated for each of the 2992 conformations
from the simulation of 1. From the crystal structure,
the three additional subunits to create the complete tetramer were
generated. Maintaining the inhibitor molecule in the position obtained
from the simulation (i.e., without performing any superimposition),
the rmsd over all inhibitor atoms present in the crystal structure
were calculated against the inhibitor in each of the four possible
symmetry-generated positions from the crystal structure, and the lowest
of the four rmsd values was used. In addition, the rmsd was calculated
after superimposing the simulated inhibitor molecules onto the crystal
structure inhibitor molecule.

Identification of Ligand-Binding
Mode
The protein ligand
interaction fingerprint application in MOE201852 was used to study the average binding mode of each inhibitor
bound to DfrB1. The calculation used the default parameters.
