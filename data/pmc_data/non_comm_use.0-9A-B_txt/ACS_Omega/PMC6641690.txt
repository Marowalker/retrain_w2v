A palladium-catalyzed
ortho-acylation of tertiary benzamides using
arylglyoxylic acids has been described. Unlike the palladium insertion
reported to occur in the distorted N–C(O) amide bond of tertiary
benzamides, the current study unveils ortho C–H palladation
in acylic or cyclic N,N-dialkylbenzamides
affording ortho-acylated tertiary benzamides in good to excellent
yields. Our experimental study on the mechanism provides information
on the tendency of the amide nitrogen toward weak coordination with
palladium as opposed to oxygen. However, density functional theory
calculations suggest coordination of amide oxygen to palladium, which
makes the mechanism especially interesting. A Pd(II)/Pd(III) catalytic
cycle and nucleophilic attack by the acyl radical rather than arylglyoxylate
anion are supported by mechanistic studies.

Introduction
Ortho-acylated tertiary
benzamides are key structural motifs that
are present in pharmaceuticals and functional materials.1 Moreover, these tertiary benzamides serve as
versatile intermediates for the synthesis of functionalized heterocycles.2 As a result, various classical methods have been
developed to prepare them.3 Among them,
directed-ortho-metallation of tertiary benzamides, pioneered by Snieckus,
has appeared as an indisputable technique for ortho-acylation.3f

Directing group-assisted transition-metal-catalyzed
ortho-acylation
in arenes using an acyl surrogate has emerged as a dependable tool
at the frontier of acylation chemistry.4 The α-oxocarboxylic acids have been used to a great extent
as convenient acyl sources with remarkable success.5 However, installation and subsequent removal of the directing
group in these acylations could limit the practical application of
the protocol. The use of a directing group would be particularly valuable
if the group is retained as a desired functionality in the product
after serving as the directing group. Toward this objective, the palladium-catalyzed
ortho-acylation of tertiary benzamides containing an alicylic or cyclic N,N-dialkylamide as the directing, functional
group was unsuccessful, largely because of palladium insertion into
the N–C(O) amide bond via N–C(O) bond activation (Scheme 1).6 Because of perturbation of amidic resonance, the N–C(O)
bond in these tertiary benzamides became activated. Thus, these distorted
tertiary benzamides were essentially employed as convenient acyl sources
in these reactions. Despite these intrinsic challenges, ortho-acylation
of tertiary benzamides with aryl aldehydes in the presence of catalytic
amounts of both Rh- and Ag-salts has been realized.7 The use of a catalytic amount of two metals for ortho C–H
bond activation, as well as the limited scope of tertiary benzamides
used in this study and inadequate information available regarding
the mechanism has left scope for further development. Perhaps most
importantly, ortho-acylation of tertiary benzamides using palladium
catalysis remains an elusive problem.

Scheme 1 Use of Tertiary Benzamides
in Acylation Chemistry
Our recent experiences with the palladium-catalyzed ortho-benzylation
of primary benzamides8 and intramolecular
acylation9 of arenes or heteroarenes using
arylglyoxylic acids as convenient acyl sources prompted us to develop
a palladium-catalyzed decarboxylative ortho-acylation of tertiary
benzamides with arylglyoxylic acids. The important question remains
as to whether a preferential ortho C–H palladation in tertiary
benzamides could be possible over the N–C(=O) bond.
Herein, we describe a palladium-catalyzed ortho-acylation of tertiary
benzamides using arylglyoxylic acids under mild conditions. The key
features include (a) palladium insertion in the ortho position of
the N,N-dialkylamide group, (b)
stabilization of palladium by coordination with amide nitrogen or
oxygen, and (c) nucleophilic attack of the electron-deficient palladium-species
by the acyl radical, as opposed to the arylglyoxylate anion. Unlike
the palladium insertion reported to occur in the N–C(O) amide
bond of tertiary benzamides, our study reveals that a preferential
ortho C–H palladation could occur in acylic or cyclic N,N-dialkylbenzamides.

Results and Discussion
Our study commenced with the reaction of N,N-diethylbenzamide 1a and phenylglyoxylic acid 2a in the presence of a palladium-catalyst and oxidant (Table 1). Previously, we9,10 and others11 demonstrated that an acyl
radical could be generated efficiently from 2a in the
presence of a persulfate reagent under thermal conditions. A judicious
choice of oxidant could serve both purposes. Therefore, persulfate
was largely used as the oxidant in our optimization study. Heating
a reaction mixture of 1a and 2a in the presence
of 10 mol % palladium acetate and K2S2O8 in acetonitrile at 80 °C for 24 h did not give any product
(Table 1, entry 1).
However, by replacing acetonitrile with 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE),
the ortho-acylated product 3a was formed in 41% yield
(entry 2). The yield was slightly improved in the presence of a different
palladium-catalyst, Pd(TFA)2 (entry 3). However, heating
a reaction of 1a and 2a in the presence
of 10 mol % Pd(TFA)2 and 3 equiv of (NH4)2S2O8 in DCE at 80 °C for 24 h had
a tremendous impact on improving the yield. Thus, under these conditions,
compound 3a was isolated in the best optimized yield
(83%, entry 4). Additional optimization using other solvents including
diglyme, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, toluene, or dimethylformamide
(DMF) was ineffective (entry 5). Interestingly, a mild oxidant could
also effect the reaction, although less efficiently (entry 6). The
reaction did not give any product without a palladium-catalyst (entry
7). A catalytic amount of an organic acid might have some influence
on the yield (entries 8–10). Although the strong acid TfOH
apparently did not have any influence, the other acids exerted a retarding
effect. Addition of a stoichiometric amount of a base significantly
reduced the yield (entry 11). Addition of a radical inhibitor such
as 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO) could markedly suppress
the formation of the product, suggesting involvement of a radical
intermediate (entry 12). Central to this investigation was the formation
of the ortho-acylated product 3a under a palladium-catalytic
condition. It is important to note that neither a product arising
from palladium insertion at the N–C(O) bond, nor an ortho,
ortho’ di-diacylated product formed in this reaction.

c Solvents such as diglyme, THF, dioxane,

Next, the ortho-acylation of 1a using various arylglyoxylic
acids was investigated (Scheme 2). Under the optimized conditions, reaction of 1a and arylglyoxylic acids containing an ortho-, meta-, or para-group
afforded the ortho-acylated tertiary benzamides 3b–i in 62–81% yields. A range of different functional
groups including methyl, halogen, alkoxy, and cyano were tolerated.
Importantly, a bromo group remained unaffected under the optimized
conditions adding value to the protocol. However, under the optimized
conditions, arylglyoxylic acid containing a tert-butyl
and ethoxy group at the para-position gave the ortho-acylated products 3j–k in the presence of a catalytic amount
of TfOH. Likewise, 2-(naphthalen-2-yl)-2-oxoacetic acid was also a
viable substrate, yielding the corresponding ortho-acylated product 3l in 88% yield. An alkyl (pyruvic acid) or heteroaryl glyoxylic
[2-(thiophen-2-yl)-α-oxoacetic acid or 2-(furan-2-yl)-α-oxoacetic
acid] acid was not compatible under the optimized conditions.

Scheme 2 Scope of Arylglyoxylic Acids
The tertiary benzamides that could participate in ortho-acylation
were also investigated (Scheme 3). Under the optimized conditions, the ortho-substituted tertiary
benzamides did not react with phenylglyoxylic acid 2a. Because of steric (methyl group) or electronic (fluoro group) effects,
the N–C(O) bond in the ortho-substituted tertiary benzamides
became distorted, leading to perturbation of amidic resonance.6 However, the meta- or para-substituent on the
periphery of the tertiary benzamides was a viable substrate for ortho-acylation
yielding the products 3m–q in 68–87%
yields. A meta-substituted tertiary benzamide 1d produced
the sterically unhindered regioisomer 3m in 82% yield.
Exclusive regiocontrol in this reaction is especially noteworthy.
3,5-Difluoro tertiary benzamide 1i was also equally competent
affording 3r in 61% isolated yield. Interestingly, reaction
of 2-naphthamide 1j and 2a gave the ortho-acylated
product 3s regioselectively. When N,N-dimethylbenzamide 1k was exposed to 2a under the optimized conditions, an ortho-acylated product 3t was isolated in 72% yield. Perhaps most importantly, cyclic N,N-dialkylbenzamides were also found to
be bonafide substrates for ortho-acylation reactions. N-Acylpyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine all reacted eventfully
with 2a yielding the corresponding ortho-acylated products 3u–w in 77–82% yields. Notably,
α-acylation to nitrogen in the cyclic ring was not observed.
These ortho-acylated products are versatile precursors for functionalized
heterocycles.2 Pivotal to the successive
realization of ortho-acylation in tertiary benzamides was ortho C–H
palladation of the tertiary benzamides under the optimized conditions.
It is noteworthy that primary (benzamide itself) and secondary aryl
carboxamides (e.g., N-methylbenzamide or N-methoxybenzamide) were not compatible under the optimized
conditions. However, N,N-diphenylbenzamide
reacted under the conditions yielding an unidentified product.

Scheme 3 Scope of Tertiary Benzamides
The following experiments were performed to gain insight
into the
reaction mechanism (Scheme 4). First, to understand whether palladation occurs at the
ortho position, a deuterium incorporation study was performed. When
compound 1e was subjected to the optimized conditions
in the absence of 2a, the reaction mixture, after quenching
with D2O, gave a mixture of the products 1e and [D]-1e in a ratio of ca. 7:3. The experiment suggested
that C–H activation was reversible
and that palladation could occur at the ortho position of the N,N-dialkylamide group. To prove the possibility
of coordination of the amide group with nitrogen, acylation reactions
were carried out under the optimized conditions with two substrates,
one wherein the NR2 group was replaced with CH3, and another wherein the CO group was replaced with CH2. Although 1o (acetophenone) did not undergo ortho-acylation
with 2a, N,N-diethylbenzylamine 1p underwent ortho, ortho’-diacylation, giving the
product 3x in 61% yield. These experiments suggest that
stabilization of palladium could occur by coordination with nitrogen.
A sterically hindered N,N-diisopropylbenzamide 1q was explored as a substrate in the reaction. Gratifyingly,
the reaction produced the ortho-acylated product 3y albeit
in moderate yield (47%). However, the bulkier N,N-dibenzylbenzamide 1r did not react under
optimized conditions. Because of the presence of a sterically crowding
group around the nitrogen, nitrogen coordination to palladium would
be difficult. This could explain the low or diminished yield of the
products. Further, N-acetyl-N-ethylbenzamide 1s was used as a substrate in the reaction. However, no reaction
occurred in this case under the optimized conditions. As the acetyl
group is able to reduce the electron density on the nitrogen, nitrogen
coordination to palladium would be difficult for electronic reasons.
Because only limited experiments were carried out to establish coordination,
the coordination of oxygen to palladium was not ruled out (see density
functional theory (DFT) calculations below). Lastly, to understand
whether an acyl radical or arylglyoxylate anion was the potential
nucleophile, the following experiments were helpful. TEMPO was able
to largely inhibit the reaction, suggesting involvement of a radical
intermediate. Another acyl source, benzaldehyde 2m, reacted
with 1a, producing 3a, which was isolated,
albeit in moderate yield. These experiments suggest that the acyl
radical formed in these reactions could undergo nucleophilic substitution
to give the product.

Scheme 4 Control Experiments
To understand the most stable structure of the palladacycle
intermediate,
DFT13 calculations were performed on the
two possible conformers, intermediates I and II (Figure 1). The geometries
were optimized using the Becke, 3-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr
(B3LYP)14 method and the LANL2DZ15 pseudo potential for Pd, and the 6-31+G(d)14 basis set for all other atoms. Optimization
and frequency calculation were performed in the gas phase and solvent
phase using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) based on integral
equation formalism (IEFPCM) solvent model in dichloroethane solvent
(dielectric constant ε = 10.36), in which the experiments were
also performed. It was observed that O-coordinated intermediate I was found to be comparatively more stable than N-coordinated
intermediate II by 10.8 kcal/mol. As theoretical speculation
can be different to experimental observation, coordination to palladium
by nitrogen or oxygen is a subject of further investigation.

Figure 1 DFT Calculation
of Palladium Intermediate I and Intermediate II.

On the basis of these experiments, the following mechanism
is proposed
(Scheme 5). Ortho C–H
palladation of 1a with Pd(TFA)2 forms either
the palladium(II) species I or II. The acyl
radical, generated in situ from 2a by reaction with persulfate
under thermal conditions,11 reacts with
either I or II to form palladium(III) species III. As (NH4)S2O8 is required
in our reaction for the reaction to be efficient, Pd(III) or Pd(IV)
could be the probable intermediate, not the Pd(II) intermediate. However,
the palladium(II) species could be the actual intermediate in the
presence of Ag2CO3 as oxidant (cf. Table 1, entry 5). The formation
of ortho-acylated product 3a is produced after reductive
elimination and Pd(II) is regenerated, thus completing the catalytic
cycle.

Scheme 5 Plausible Mechanism
In conclusion, the palladium-catalyzed ortho-acylation
of tertiary
benzamides using arylglyoxylic acids as the acyl source was developed.
A key distinctive feature is the palladium insertion into the ortho
C–H bond of the N,N-dialkylamide
group, as opposed to the N–C(O) amide bond of the tertiary
benzamides. In contrast to the literature, wherein a weak coordination
of palladium and carbonyl oxygen is reported to prevail, our mechanistic
study indicates that stabilization of palladium could occur by coordination
with nitrogen or oxygen. Further investigations into the mechanism
could reveal ample evidence of nitrogen coordination to palladium.
