Borate
toxicity is a concern in agriculture since a high level
of borates may likely exist in irrigation water systems. In this research,
transmission infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
are employed to study the thermal and photochemical reactions of isopropoxy
tetramethyl dioxaborolane (ITDB) on TiO2, with the aid
of density functional theory calculations. In addition, the possibility
for the formation of a boron-modified TiO2 (B/TiO2) surface, using ITDB as the boron source, is explored and the photocatalytic
activity of the B/TiO2 is tested. After adsorption of ITDB
on TiO2 at 35 °C and heating the surface to a temperature
higher than ∼200 °C in a vacuum, the surface is found
to be covered with both the organic components of OC(CH3)2–C(CH3)2O and OCH(CH3)2 and the inorganic components of (TiO2)BO and Ti–B–O. The organic intermediates can be further
thermally transformed into pinacolone and acetone; however, the inorganic
parts exist at 400 °C, forming a boron-modified surface. The
thermal decomposition of ITDB is proposed to be initiated by breaking
one B–O bond, forming −OC(CH3)2–C(CH3)2O–B–OCH(CH3)2 on the surface. In the case of photoreaction,
the ITDB on TiO2 decomposes under photoirradiation at 325
nm to form acetone. The boron-modified TiO2 surface can
absorb visible light, likely due to the presence of new states in
the band gap, and shows a photocatalytical activity in degrading methylene
blue, under 500 nm irradiation in air.

==== Body
Introduction
Borate esters are boron-containing
organic compounds, which have
two main classes of B(OR)3 and B3O3(OR)3. The R can be an alkyl or an aryl group. Borate
esters, trimethyl borate [B(OCH3)3] for example,
have a variety of applications as precursors for boric acid derivatives,
as boron sources to manufacture biocides and corrosion inhibitors,
as catalysts for the production of resins, or as lubricants to reduce
friction and wear.1,2

Recently, the tribological
properties of isopropoxy tetramethyl
dioxaborolane (ITDB), with the structure of [B(OCH(CH3)2)(OC(CH3)2(CH3)2CO)] shown in Scheme S1, on copper surfaces
have been investigated, which is related to the lubrication of a sliding
Cu(s)–Cu(s) contact in an electric rotor
and to the molecular structure tribological chemistry.3,4 In addition to the usage for forming tribofilms, trialkyl borates
have been employed as a boron source in preparation of boron-doped
TiO2 materials to study their photoactivities, using a
sol–gel method or via thermal decomposition over existing TiO2.5−7 Zhang et al. used Ti(OC4H9)4 and B(OC4H9)3 as the starting
compounds to prepare boron-doped TiO2 by the sol–gel
method.5 It was found that this photocatalyst
could decompose methyl orange under UV irradiation. Zaleska et al.
prepared B-doped TiO2, using Ti(OC3H7)4, B(OC2H5)3, and B(OH)3, and found its photocatalytic activity in phenol decomposition
under visible light irradiation.6 Lu’s
group deposited B on a nanotube-like TiO2 film through
B(OCH3)3 decomposition and showed its activity
in photocatalytic degradation of pentachlorophenol, with UV and visible
light exposure.7

Although borate
esters are possible precursors to prepare boron-doped
TiO2, their reactions in the preparation processes on TiO2, as well as on other metal-oxide surfaces, have not been
revealed. Besides, borate toxicity is also a concern in agriculture
since a high level of borates may likely be present in irrigation
water systems.8 Remedies of environmental
air and water pollution using TiO2 to degrade organic contaminants
have attracted great attention. In boron-doped TiO2, theoretical
calculations suggest that the boron atom may be present at an interstitial
site or as a substituent to an oxygen atom.9−11 The interstitial
boron atoms behave as an electron donor that can reduce the Ti4+ to Ti3+. In the latter case, it creates new states
in the band gap and becomes a potential, visible-light-sensitive photocatalyst.
In the present research, we investigate the thermal and photochemical
chemistry of ITDB on TiO2, explore its possibility to form
boron-modified TiO2, and evaluate the visible-light-sensitive
photocatalytic activity of the modified surface. It is found that
boron atoms are left on the TiO2 surface upon thermal reaction
of ITDB at 400 °C under a vacuum, forming a B-modified TiO2 surface, which induces photocatalytic degradation of methylene
blue deposited in the irradiation of the light at 500 nm.

Results and Discussion
We have calculated the structure of ITDB and its vibrational frequencies
because they are unavailable in the literature and help in the identification
of the surface species after adsorption of this molecule on TiO2. Scheme 1 shows
the calculated ITDB structure, with selected bond angles and lengths.
It is found that the ∠OBO in the ring (113.8°) is less
than another two ∠OBO angles (121.2 and 125.0°), implying
a possible strain present in the 5-membered ring. However, the two
B–O bond lengths in the ring (1.388 and 1.393 Å) are elongated
by ∼0.025 Å as compared to that of the other B–O
bond (1.365 Å). These structure parameters suggest that ITDB
on TiO2 is more likely to decompose through B–O
bond breakage in the ring due to the ring strain and weaker B–O
bond strength.

Scheme 1 Calculated ITDB Structure and Selected Bond Angles
and Lengths
Table 1 shows the
major calculated vibration frequencies (≥1000 cm–1) of a single ITDB molecule. From this calculation showing coupling
of vibrational modes, it can be roughly summarized that the δas(BO3) contributes to the absorptions in the range
of ∼1320–1480 cm–1, ρ(CH3) to ∼1010–1250 cm–1, δ(CH)
to ∼1320–1480 cm–1, δs(CH3) to ∼1360–1380 cm–1, δas(CH3) to ∼1440–1480
cm–1, ν(CC) to ∼1130–1380 cm–1, ν(CO) to ∼1110–1210 cm–1, ν(CH) to ∼2960–3050 cm–1,
νs(CH3) to ∼2960–2980 cm–1, and νas(CH3) to ∼3050–3085
cm–1.

results of this work.

Adsorption of
ITDB on TiO2 and SiO2
Three experimental
infrared spectra of TiO2 after adsorption
of ITDB are shown in Figure 1. The labeled 0.1 Torr (Figure 1a) denotes the vapor pressure of ITDB introduced into
the infrared cell for adsorption on TiO2 at 35 °C,
followed by cell evacuation. The infrared bands in the range of 1000–1600
cm–1 overlap considerably. Figure 1b,c shows the spectra obtained after further
introducing 0.1 and 0.2 Torr (0.2 and 0.4 Torr in total) of ITDB molecules
into the cell. From 0.1 to 0.2 Torr, the increasing band intensities,
without accompanying obvious peak shifts in frequency, indicate the
increase of surface coverage. However, the bands are not proportionally
enhanced. The peak intensities of 1151, 1386, and 2975 cm–1 increase by ∼2.45, 2.45, and 1.9 times, respectively. This
result suggests that adsorption of ITDB on TiO2 at 35 °C
may not generate just one surface species; for example, they can be
ITDB itself and its dissociative form through B–O bond breakage.
From 0.2 to 0.4 Torr, the absorptions in the range of 2800–3000
cm–1 are similar, in terms of the peak positions
and intensities. However, a very different absorption behavior is
observed between 1000 and 1550 cm–1. In addition
to the increase of overall absorbance, changes of relative peak intensities
and slight peak shifts are found. For example, the 1386 cm–1 peak is shifted to 1395 cm–1, together with the
largely increased intensity at 1151 cm–1. From 0.2
to 0.4 Torr, the relative amounts of surface species can vary, resulting
in the quite similar absorptions between 2800 and 3000 cm–1 (CHx stretching region) in contrast
to the changes in the range 1000–1550 cm–1. These can be explained if the surface species have a similar absorption
behavior or if one of the surface species has relatively very small
absorptions in the CHx stretching region.
In the range of 3400–3800 cm–1 in Figure 1, the presence of
negative peaks indicates that the adsorbed ITDB can interact with
the surface isolated OH groups, presumably via hydrogen bonding of
Ti–OH···O–B.

Figure 1 Infrared spectra of TiO2 obtained after successively
introducing ITDB vapor [from 0.1 to 0.4 Torr in total, (a–c)]
into the IR cell for adsorption at 35 °C, followed by cell evacuation.

Figure 2 shows three
infrared spectra of SiO2 (35 °C) after adsorption
of ITDB in different amounts. The SiO2 used is much less
reactive than the TiO2.12,13 The major
bands appear at 1321, 1386, 1456, 1477, and 2984 cm–1. The absorptions of ITDB below ∼1300 cm–1 have been cut off due to the absorptions of SiO2 itself.
In contrast to the case of TiO2 (Figure 1), the absorption frequencies of ITDB on
SiO2 are basically the same, without changing with the
dosing pressures. Moreover, all of the peak intensities increase by
the same ratio, indicating that only one surface species exists from
0.2 to 0.6 Torr. It is proposed that ITDB is molecularly adsorbed
on SiO2 at 35 °C. Note that, in Figure 2, the intensities of 1386 and 2984 cm–1 are much smaller that of 1456 cm–1. However, in Figure 1a,b, the absorptions at 1386 and 2975 cm–1 are
stronger than or comparable to that of 1458 cm–1, suggesting the possible decomposition of ITDB on TiO2. The observed infrared bands of ITDB/SiO2 are listed
in Table 1 and can
be assigned as follows: 1321 cm–1 to ν(CH)
+ νas(BO3); 1386 cm–1 to δs(CH3) + νs(CCC)
+ νas(OBO); 1456 cm–1 to δas(CH3) + νas(BO3);
and 2984 cm–1 to ν(CHx). For comparison, the observed infrared absorptions of ITDB/TiO2 at 35 °C (0.4 Torr, Figure 1) are also included in Table 1.

Figure 2 Infrared spectra of SiO2 obtained
after successively
introducing ITDB vapor into the IR cell for adsorption at 35 °C,
followed by cell evacuation. The spectra in the range of 2800–4000
cm–1 have been multiplied by a factor of 3.

Adsorption of 2-Propanol, Pinacol, Pinacolone,
and Boric Acid
on TiO2
To explore the reaction pathways of ITDB
on TiO2, we
have investigated the adsorption of 2-propanol and pinacol on TiO2, which contain the organic parts of OCH(CH3)2 and OC(CH3)2C(CH3)2O of ITDB, respectively, attempting to identify the reaction intermediates
generated from the ITDB decomposition. Moreover, adsorption of boric
acid (B(OH)3) on TiO2 has been studied as well,
to reveal the destiny of the inorganic BO3 in the ITDB
reaction. Figure 3a
shows the infrared spectra of 2-propanol adsorbed on TiO2 at 35 °C, followed by heating the surface to 200 °C under
a vacuum. In general, aliphatic alcohols adsorbed on TiO2 at room temperature exist both in intact, molecular form and dissociative
form of alkoxys.14,15 The adsorbed alcohols can desorb
or further deprotonate, leaving only alkoxys on the surface at higher
temperatures. The 200 °C spectrum of Figure 3a is due to adsorbed 2-propoxy, with a relatively
strong C–O stretching vibration at 1134 cm–1. Figure 3b shows
the temperature-dependent infrared spectra of TiO2 after
adsorption of pinacol and water. Note that the pinacol molecules were
co-deposited with water by spraying an aqueous pinacol solution onto
the TiO2 catalyst at room temperature. In the 35 °C
spectrum, the main infrared absorptions appear at 1132, 1155, 1374,
1467, 1560, 1621, 2938, and 2977 cm–1. Except for
the 1560 and 1621 cm–1, which could be attributed
to adsorbed carbonate (from background CO or CO2 adsorption)
and water, respectively, the other peaks are found to agree with the
gaseous pinacol infrared absorptions reported previously.16 For the adsorbed pinacol, the peaks in the range
of 2915–2992 cm–1 are due to CH3 stretching modes and the peaks from 1365 to 1467 cm–1 are due to CH3 bending modes. The strongest 1155 cm–1 peak and the shoulder of 1132 cm–1 are related to C–O and C–C–C stretching vibrations.16 The intensity ratio of 2977/1155 cm–1 (I2977/I1155) is ∼0.50. This ratio increases at higher temperatures and
can be used to strongly support the formation of pinacolone (explained
later). As shown in Figure 3b, the carbonate (1560 cm–1) and water (1621
cm–1) peaks largely decrease or disappear, as the
surface temperature is increased to 200 °C under a vacuum. A
small, broad band appears at 1675 cm–1, assignable
to a carbonyl stretching vibration. Upon heating to 250 °C, the
1675 cm–1 peak grows considerably, at the sacrifice
of the ∼1150 cm–1 intensity. The intensity
ratio of 2977/1150 cm–1 becomes ∼0.70. These
infrared changes with temperature indicate the thermal decomposition
of pinacol, forming a C = O-containing species on the surface.

Figure 3 Temperature-dependent
infrared spectra of (a) 2-propanol, (b) pinacol,
and (c) pinacolone on TiO2. 2-Propanol and pinacolone were
dosed at 35 °C, followed by heating the surface to the indicated
temperatures under vacuum. Pinacol and water were coadsorbed on TiO2. All of the spectra were recorded at 35 °C in a vacuum.

Figure 3c shows
the infrared spectrum of pinacolone adsorbed on TiO2 at
35 °C, followed by surface heating to 150 °C. Because both
pinacol and pinacolone possess several CH3 groups, they
have significantly overlapping peaks near 1150, 1360, 1470, and 2975
cm–1. However, the adsorbed pinacolone has the strongest,
characteristic C=O stretching peak at 1680 cm–1 and a much smaller C–O stretching peak at 1145 cm–1. The former peak matches the observed 1675 cm–1 peak in the 250 °C spectrum of Figure 3b, signifying the formation of pinacolone
from the pinacol thermal reaction on TiO2. For the adsorbed
pinacolone (Figure 3c), the intensity ratio of 2975/1680 cm–1 (I2975/I1680) is ∼0.50.
At 250 °C of the pinacol/TiO2 system (Figure 3b), the surface is covered
with pinacolone and residual pinacol, showing the relatively strong
peaks at 1675 and 1150 cm–1, respectively. Both
the surface species contribute to the CH3 stretching absorption
at 2977 cm–1 in the 250 °C spectrum. In other
words, the 2977 cm–1 intensity at 250 °C can
be roughly estimated from the 1675 cm–1 intensity
of pinacolone and the 1150 cm–1 intensity of pinacol,
with the known intensity ratios of I2975/I1680 = 0.5 for pinacolone and I2977/I1155 = 0.5
for pinacol. It is found that the estimated 2977 cm–1 intensity is close to the measured intensity, within a 5% difference.
This result further supports the formation of pinacolone from pinacol
thermal decomposition on TiO2.

The chemical transformation
of pinacol to pinacolone in the presence
of strong acids, H2SO4, for example, is called
pinacol–pinacolone rearrangement. This organic reaction is
initiated by the protonation of one of the OH groups in a pinacol
molecule. A carbenium ion [HO(CH3)2CC+(CH3)2] is thus formed after the detachment
of a H2O molecule. The migration of a methyl group and
dissociation of the O–H bond for the carbenium ion would generate
a pinacolone molecule. This rearrangement reaction can also proceed
on acidic solid catalysts.17 On TiO2, the surface Ti4+ ions can play an acid role and
promote the C–OH bond dissociation of pinacol and generation
of a carbenium-like ion on the surface, eventually resulting in pinacolone
formation.

Boric acid [B(OH)3] adsorption on hydrous
ferric oxide
has been carried out in aqueous solutions at pH 10.4 and investigated
with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.8 This previous
study reported three broad bands of 1150 (shoulder), 1250, and 1350
cm–1, which were assigned to the BOH bending and
B–O stretching modes of an inner-sphere trigonal (FeO)2BOH species. We have studied the adsorption of boric acid
on TiO2, with the infrared result shown in Figure 4. In the 35 °C spectrum,
boric acid adsorption causes infrared absorptions near 1326 cm–1, with the coadsorbed H2O bending peak
at 1624 cm–1. After heating the surface to 200 °C,
two broad absorptions (1211 and 1334 cm–1) below
1500 cm–1 are observed, which might be due to tightly
bound BO3 or O2BOH species.8

Figure 4 Infrared spectra of TiO2 after adsorption of boric acid
and water, followed by heating the surface to 200 °C in a vacuum.
The spectra were recorded at the indicated temperatures.

Thermal Decomposition of ITDB on TiO2
Figure 5a shows
the temperature-dependent infrared spectra of TiO2 after
adsorption of ITDB molecules. The ITDB adsorption on TiO2 (35 °C) was performed by directly introducing 0.4 Torr of the
vapor pressure into the cell, followed by cell evacuation. The infrared
spectra were recorded after heating the TiO2 surface to
the temperatures indicated in a vacuum. The 35 °C spectrum is
similar to that shown in Figure 1c. Upon heating to 100 °C, the absorption at 1398
cm–1 is relatively enhanced, although no significant
changes are observed in the entire spectral range. The peak intensity
of 1398 cm–1, relative to that of 1444 cm–1, continuously increases, as the surface is further heated to 200
°C. In the 200 °C spectrum, the major absorptions are located
at 1026, 1124, 1151, 1244, 1375, 1398, 1444, 1475, 2939, and 2975
cm–1, which are listed in Table 1. To further analyze the detailed changes
from 35 to 200 °C, the 35 °C spectrum has been subtracted
from the 200 °C one and the differential spectrum is shown in Figure 5b. The main negative
peak at 1480 cm–1, together with the smaller ones
at 1161, 2929, and 2966 cm–1, can be explained by
the decrease of adsorbed ITDB molecules due to dissociation and/or
desorption as the TiO2 is heated from 35 to 200 °C.
The positive peaks in Figure 5b, representing the increases in intensity, appear near 1024,
1137, 1217, 1329, and 1400 cm–1, which can be related
to reaction intermediates of ITDB on TiO2. Continuously
heating the surface to 250 °C causes a considerable change in
the infrared absorption pattern. The absorptions between 2800 and
3000 cm–1 decrease largely, together with the disappearance
or almost vanishing of the sharp peaks at 1151 and 1398 cm–1. A new set of peaks at 1026, 1140, 1332, 1381, and 1664 cm–1 appear in the 250 °C spectrum. The former four peaks seem to
sit on broad features. As the surface is further heated to 300 or
400 °C, only three broad absorptions are observed near 1122,
1269, and 1369 cm–1. To more clearly show the infrared
changes from 250 to 300 °C, a difference spectrum has been obtained
by subtracting the 250 °C spectrum from the 300 °C one,
with a correction factor of 0.9, as shown in Figure 5c, which shows the loss of the peaks at 1026,
1137, 1331, 1383, 1466, 1664, 2873, 2939, and 2976 cm–1. The two strongest, negative bands at 1137 [ν(CO)] and 2976
[ν(CHx)] cm–1 are
similar to the observed strong bands in the 200 °C spectra of
2-propanol/TiO2 (1134 and 2974 cm–1)
and pinacol/TiO2 (1150 and 2977 cm–1).
This resemblance suggests that the B–O bonds in ITDB have broken
on TiO2 at 250 °C, forming the organic groups of (CH3)2CHO– and −OC(CH3)2–C(CH3)2O– [or HOC(CH3)2–C(CH3)2O−]
directly bonding to the surface. The latter two species can further
be transformed into pinacolone on TiO2, which is responsible
for the negative 1664 cm–1 peak in Figure 5c. The 1331 cm–1 peak in Figure 5c
also strongly suggests the presence of 2-propoxy on TiO2, as supported by the 200 °C spectrum of Figure 3a. 2-Propoxy can further react on TiO2 to form acetone.18,19

Figure 5 (a) Temperature-dependent
infrared spectra of ITDB on TiO2 and (b, c) two differential
spectra. The ITDB was dosed at 35 °C,
followed by progressively heating the surface to the indicated temperatures
under a vacuum. All of the spectra were recorded at 35 °C. Both
the differential spectra have been multiplied by a factor of 3.

As shown in Figure 5a, organic components, such as CH3, have
been removed
from the surface at 300 °C. The observed broad features (1122,
1269, and 1369 cm–1) in the 300 °C spectrum
are from inorganic absorptions, suggesting the presence of B–O-containing
inorganic species on TiO2. (TiO)2BOH is a possible
form. However, the existence of a Ti–B–O bonding form
cannot be ruled out, which can be generated in the thermal decomposition
of ITDB on TiO2 in a vacuum, by evolving O-containing reaction
products, such as acetone and pinacolone.

It has been shown
that heating the ITDB/TiO2 from 35
to 200 °C in a vacuum can cause desorption and/or further decomposition
of the boron-containing molecules. The 200 °C infrared spectrum
of ITDB/TiO2 (Figure 5a) is considered to be originated from a reaction intermediate,
and its further decomposition forms the organic groups of (CH3)2CHO– and −OC(CH3)2–C(CH3)2O– on TiO2. It is proposed that this intermediate is generated by breaking
one of the B–O bonds of ITDB, to remove the ring strain. We
have theoretically obtained the optimized structure of the dissociative
ITDB on anatase(101) and its vibrational frequencies, as shown in Scheme 2 and Table 1. In this optimized adsorption
geometry, the B atom is chemically attached to a bridging oxygen atom
and the O atom is bonded to a 5-fold coordinated titanium atom after
the B–O bond dissociation. Moreover, the calculated vibrational
frequencies (1000–1500 cm–1) of the dissociated
ITDB agree with the 200 °C spectrum of ITDB/TiO2 (Figure 5a). On Cu(111), ITDB
is suggested to decompose primarily by B–O bond scission, forming
two surface intermediates of [−OCH(CH3)2] and [−B(OC(CH3)2–C(CH3)2O)].4 The isopropoxy continuously
reacts on the surface and generates acetone at 54 °C. The boron-containing
intermediate also reacts to form acetone (118 °C) and 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene
(91 °C), leaving B and BOx on the
surface, respectively.4

Structure of ITDB on Anatase TiO2(101)
Photoreaction of ITDB on TiO2
Figure 6 shows the
infrared spectra recorded during the photoirradiation (325 nm) process
of ITDB/TiO2 in the presence of 10 Torr of O2. Initially, the TiO2 surface is covered with intact and
dissociated ITDB. Along with the photoirradiation, the peaks relating
to ITDB decrease in intensity gradually. A new peak at 1693 cm–1 emerges at around 10 min and increases with photoirradiation
time. This peak is attributed to adsorbed acetone. The carbonyl stretching
absorption of acetone on TiO2 has been reported to be at
∼1700 cm–1.18,19Figure 7 shows the infrared spectra
recorded during the photoirradiation process of ITDB on SiO2 using the same condition as that of TiO2. It is found
that the peak intensities of ITDB do not change after 120 min photoirradiation.
New peaks from photoproducts are not observed either. The SiO2 result indicates that the ITDB degradation on TiO2 under the photon exposure is not through a direct photodissociation
mechanism but is mediated by TiO2. Electron–hole
pairs can be quickly generated as the TiO2 absorbs photons
with energy higher than the band gap. The photogenerated electrons
can be captured by O2, forming reactive oxygen anions,
such as O2–. The lifetime of the holes
is therefore increased. These reactive species of O2– and h+ would initiate an oxidation reaction
for the organic parts in ITDB, i.e., (CH3)2CHO–
and/or −OC(CH3)2–C(CH3)2O–, to form acetone.

a factor of 10.

Characterization
and Visible-Light-Sensitive Photoactivity of
the Boron-Modified TiO2 Surface
The boron-modified
TiO2 was prepared by heating an ITDB/TiO2 surface
to 400 °C in a vacuum. The infrared result of Figure 5 suggests the presence
of BO3 and/or Ti–B–O species on the surface.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to study the states
of B 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p for the ITDB adsorbed on TiO2 at
35 °C, followed by heating the surface to 400 °C under a
vacuum. The XPS results are shown in Figure 8. The peaks at 458.7 and 464.4 eV are due
to Ti4+ ions from the TiO2 substrate, with its
O 1s at 529.9 eV. No Ti3+ state at lower binding energies
is observed. The B 1s state appears at 191.7 eV. The B 1s binding
energy of B2O3 or B(OH)3 has been
reported to be ∼193.0 eV, in contrast to the ∼187.5
eV of TiB2. Besides, B 1s binding energy in the range of
191.6–192.0 eV has been attributed to Ti–B–O
species in the previous boron-doped TiO2 studies.20−22

Figure 8 X-ray
photoelectron spectra of B 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p recorded after
dosing ITDB onto TiO2 at 35 °C and subsequent surface
heating to 400 °C under a vacuum.

Figure 9 compares
the UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the B-modified
TiO2 from ITDB/TiO2 and the pristine TiO2 (Degussa P25) itself. For the latter case, it is transparent
to visible light due to the band gap of ∼3.2 eV corresponding
to ∼400 nm. With the TiO2 surface modified with
boron, the absorptions between 400 and 800 nm are enhanced, showing
its potential to be a visible-light-sensitive photocatalyst. Theoretical
calculations have pointed out that boron substitution to the oxygen
of TiO2 can create new states in the band gap.9−11 In the present case, the boron is likely in the forms of Ti–B–O
and/or (TiO2)BO on the B-modified TiO2 surface.
The states in the band gap may be originated from the boron atom and/or
from TiO2 surface defects generated by the boron-containing
species. The acceptor states in the band gap of TiO2 can
serve as stepping sites to relay the valence electrons to the conduction
band, upon absorbing visible light. In Figure 9, the band gap of P25 is estimated to be
3.05 eV (407 nm), which is approximately the onset of the sharp B/TiO2 absorption. This result suggests that the surface-modified
TiO2 with B (B/TiO2) has a similar band-gap
energy, as compared to the bare TiO2 (P25).

Figure 9 UV–visible diffuse
reflectance spectra of (a) P25-TiO2 and (b) B-modified
TiO2. The onset of the sharp
increase in absorbance for both samples is approximately estimated
to be 407 nm (3.05 eV).

The photoactivities
of the B-modified TiO2 and TiO2 (P25) are compared
in methylene blue (MB) decoloration in
an air–solid system,23 which could
be employed in self-surface-cleaning. Figure 10 shows the spectral changes of MB molecules
on the B/TiO2 and P25 particles as a function of photoirradiation
time. The initial absorbances of MB on both TiO2 samples
before photoirradiation are not exactly the same, which are probably
due to different MB coverages and/or different surface textures of
the measured samples that can affect light scattering of TiO2. Under illumination at 500 nm, the MB/TiO2 (P25) absorption
is shifted toward lower wavelengths but without inducing a large change
in integrated peak intensity between 400 and 800 nm (Figure 10a). The blue shift can be
explained by the change in the interaction of MB molecules with P25
particles after the photoillumination. MB molecule itself can absorb
visible light and becomes an electronically excited state (MB*), with
a different electron distribution from that of the ground state, therefore
producing a MB*–TiO2 interaction not the same as
MB–TiO2 one. Even as the excited MB falls back to
the ground state, the interaction of MB with TiO2 may not
completely return to the original situation. The slightly reduced
peak area after 150 min photoirradiation reveals that the extent of
MB photodegradation at 500 nm is small. As a contrast, the B/TiO2 causes a larger photocatalytic degradation of MB, as shown
in Figure 10b. In
addition to a blue shift, the absorbance of MB is continuously reduced
with photoillumination time. The visible wavelength absorption of
the B/TiO2 could generate electron–hole pairs due
to new states present in the band gap, resulting in the formation
of OH• and O2–. OH•, O2–, and h+ are active species and can react with MB, leading to its decomposition. Figure 10c shows the normalized
MB integrated peak intensities in the range of 400–800 nm as
a function of photoirradiation time for the B/TiO2 and
TiO2 (P25). The initial peak area in each case is scaled
to 1.0. The MB on B/TiO2 decreases continuously with irradiation
time, down to ∼40% after 150 min.

Summary
As shown in Scheme 3, ITDB can be dissociatively
adsorbed in –OC(CH3)2–C(CH3)2O–B–OCH(CH3)2 form on TiO2, by breaking one of
the B–O bonds. Continuous decomposition of this surface species
at a temperature higher than ∼200 °C would generate the
organic moieties of OC(CH3)2–C(CH3)2O and OCH(CH3)2 directly
bonding on the TiO2 and the inorganic components of (TiO2)BO and Ti–B–O. The organic groups can further
decompose, forming pinacolone and acetone. The boron-modified TiO2 surface (B/TiO2) absorbs visible light, possibly
due to the formation of new states in the band gap, and can photocatalytically,
at 500 nm, degrade methylene blue on TiO2 in air. Besides,
acetone is found to be the reaction product in the photoirradiation
(325 nm) of ITDB/TiO2 in O2.

Scheme 3 Proposed Surface
Reaction of ITDB on TiO2
Experimental
and Computational Methods
The TiO2 powder (Degussa
P25, ∼50 m2 g–1) containing mixed
phases of anatase (70%)
and rutile (30%) was supported on a tungsten fine mesh for infrared
measurements. The powder was first uniformly dispersed in a water/acetone
solution and then sprayed onto a tungsten mesh (1.5 × 2.2 cm2). After that, the TiO2/W was mounted inside the
IR cell. The W mesh was fully covered with TiO2 of approximately
0.05 g. The detailed TiO2/W preparation and the IR cell
structure have been reported previously.24,25 The IR cell had two KBr windows for IR transmission and was connected
to a gas manifold and a turbomolecular pump for a base pressure of
∼1.0 × 10–7 Torr. The TiO2 sample in the cell was heated to 450 °C for 24 h in a vacuum
by passing an electric current through the W mesh. The TiO2 temperature was measured by a K-type thermocouple spotwelded on
the tungsten support. To further remove possible organic contaminants
on TiO2, before each run of the experiment, its temperature
was held at 450 °C in a vacuum for 2 h and at 350 °C for
0.5 h in the presence of 3.0 Torr of O2. After the heating
treatment, the cell was evacuated when the TiO2 temperature
was decreased to 70 °C and 10 Torr of O2 was introduced
into the cell to compensate for the possible oxygen loss of the TiO2 caused by the heating treatment. When the TiO2 temperature reached 35 °C, the cell was evacuated again for
gas or vapor dosing, and an infrared spectrum was recorded as the
reference background. The procedure to prepare SiO2 (Cab-O-Sil)/W
was similar to that of TiO2/W, but the SiO2 powder
was dispersed in H2O. Isopropoxy tetramethyl dioxaborolane
(97%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-propanol (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), pinacol (98%,
Sigma-Aldrich), pinacolone (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), boric acid [B(OH)3, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich], and O2 (99.998%, Matheson)
were used as received without further purification. Each liquid reagent
was transferred to a sample tube as quickly as possible to avoid possible
contamination. Moreover, the air in the sample tube was removed by
three cycles of freeze–pump–thaw with liquid nitrogen.
The adsorption of these reagents was performed by introducing their
vapors into the IR cell with the TiO2/W. The reagent vapor
was first introduced into a segment (∼60 mL for the volume)
of the gas manifold, with a Baratron capacitance manometer to measure
the pressure. Then, the cell valve separating the segment and the
infrared cell was opened, allowing the compound to be in contact with
the TiO2 surface at ∼35 °C. The volume for
the cell was ∼300 mL. Without TiO2 in the cell,
the pressure was assumed to be dropped down to one-sixth after opening
the cell valve. The reduced pressure was reported in the experimental
results of this study. Because of the insufficient volatility of pinacol
and boric acid, their deposition on TiO2 was carried out
differently. First, the high-temperature-treated TiO2/W
sample was removed from the cell after the reference spectrum was
recorded. An aqueous pinacol (0.02 M) or boric acid (0.01 M) solution
was then sprayed onto the TiO2/W surface. Afterward, the
TiO2/W sample with coadsorbed pinacol and water (or boric
acid and water) was remounted inside the cell, followed by evacuation
overnight to partially remove adsorbed water prior to temperature-dependent
infrared measurements. Infrared spectra were recorded with a 4 cm–1 resolution by a Bruker FTIR spectrometer (Vector
22) with an MCT detector. The entire optical path was purged with
CO2-free dry air. The spectra presented here have been
ratioed against the TiO2 background spectrum. In addition,
the adsorption state of ITDB on TiO2 at 35 °C, followed
by surface heating to 400 °C in a vacuum, has been analyzed by
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using the ULVAC-PHI spectrometer
(PHI 5000 Versaprobe II), calibrated at the Ag 3d5/2 peak
and with an excitation beam of 1486.7 eV. In the photochemistry study,
both the UV and IR beams were 45° to the normal of the TiO2 sample. The UV light source used was a combination of a 350
W Hg arc lamp (Oriel Corp), a water filter, and a band-pass filter
with a bandwidth of ∼100 nm centered at ∼325 nm. The
photon power at the position of the TiO2 sample was ∼240
mW/cm2 determined by an optical power meter (Newport 1917R).
The boron-modified TiO2 (B/TiO2) was obtained
by adsorption of ITDB on TiO2 at 35 °C, followed by
heating the surface to 400 °C in a vacuum to remove the organic
moieties from the surface. The visible light absorption of B/TiO2 has been confirmed by UV–visible reflectance using
the Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer. In the study of methylene blue
(MB) photodegradation of the air–B/TiO2 system,
0.1 g of the B/TiO2 was mixed with 200 μL of an aqueous
MB solution (1.56 mM, 500 ppm). The MB/B/TiO2 slurry was
then kept in dark for 24 h and pressed into an indented circular area
(ϕ ≈ 1.0 cm) in a glass plate. The MB coating process
on B/TiO2 was conducted in a dim or dark environment to
avoid possible photocatalysis. No color fading was found for the blue
MB/B/TiO2 film by the naked eye after 24 h storage in the
dark. The loaded MB/B/TiO2 was subjected to photoillumination
at 500 nm. The blue film gradually became white along with the photon
exposure, which was further examined by UV–visible reflectance
measurements. Photoirradiation of MB/B/TiO2 was carried
out for 150 min, but the light was turned off every 30 min for the
measurements of UV–visible spectra. In terms of the following
two reasons, we chose 500 nm as the irradiation wavelength for the
photocatalytic degradation of MB on B/TiO2. The absorption
of B/TiO2 at 500 nm is relatively high and the absorption
of MB on B/TiO2 at 500 nm is relatively low, shown later,
that can avoid visible light bleaching of MB.26 The light source was a combination of a mercury lamp, a water filter,
and a band-pass filter at 500 nm (Newport, 10BPF25-500). The light
power at the MB/B/TiO2 surface was measured to be ∼28.6
mW/cm2.

The structure of an isolated ITDB molecule
and the dissociative
adsorption structures of ITDB [−OC(CH3)2–C(CH3)2O–B–OCH(CH3)2] on the anatase(101) model surface were calculated
in the framework of density functional theory using DMol3 package. In these calculations, the generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) formulation
was employed. A double-numeric quality basis set with polarization
functional (DNP), a Monkhorst–Pack k-point
set at 2 × 3 × 1, and a supercell of 24 [TiO2] units with dimensions of 7.55 × 10.89 × 21.35 Å3 were used in this study. All of the TiO2 slabs
were separated by a 12.0 Å vacuum space. The positions of the
Ti and O atoms in the first and second layers of the slabs were allowed
to be varied in the optimized structure calculations. In addition,
the vibrational frequencies of ITDB and its dissociative form on anatase(101)
were also calculated. No scaling factor was used for the reported
frequencies. The mode assignments were based on the animated molecular
vibrations.
