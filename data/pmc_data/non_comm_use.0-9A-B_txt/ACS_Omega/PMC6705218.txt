In
recent years, cases of retinal toxicity occurred in some European,
Middle Eastern, and South American countries following the use of
perfluorocarbon liquids (PFCLs) on vitreoretinal surgeries owing to
impurities in the product. Moreover, Spanish ophthalmologists reported
several toxic cases on the use of perfluoro-n-octane
Ala Octa (Alamedics, Dornstadt, Germany), raising the necessity of
reviewing the current validated methods used for assessing the safety
of PFCLs. We proved that in samples of PFCLs contaminated on purpose
with impurities previously detected in Ala Octa devices, the determination
of the so-called H-content using a 1H NMR quantitative
assay implemented with the electronic reference to access in vivo
concentrations 2 technology failed to demonstrate a correlation between
the H-content and in vitro cytotoxicity test in ARPE-19 and BALB 3T3
cell lines. Therefore, direct information on the safety of PFCLs was
provided only by the cytotoxicity test in vitro validated according
to ISO 10993-5, and the H-content was not predictive of perfluorocarbon
ocular endotamponade cytotoxicity in vitro.

Introduction
Perfluorocarbon liquids
(PFCLs) have been used effectively as an
intraoperative tool during vitreous surgery for complicated retinal
detachments since the 1980s.1 In 1990,
Sparrow et al.2 showed that the presence
of not fully fluorinated compounds at a concentration higher than
10% in PFCLs induced cytotoxicity in the fibroblast cell culture.
Recently, Pastor et al.3 reported 117 cases
of acute retinal toxicity with severe visual loss, which is mostly
characterized by retinal necrosis and vascular occlusion after intraoperative
use of perfluoro-n-octane (PFO) Ala Octa (Alamedics,
Dornstadt, Germany). Such severe adverse events raised an animated
discussion within the scientific and medical community about the safety
of PFCL medical devices,4 particularly
on the validity of the methods used for their safety assessment (ISO
10993-5 and ISO 16672),5,6 and emphasized the necessity to
review the standardized in vitro cytotoxicity test and the development
of chemical analytical methods able to detect the presence of potentially
cytotoxic compounds. To deal with the latter, Menz et al.7 developed an analytical method based on the electrochemical
determination of the fluorine produced via the reaction of partially
hydrogenated perfluoroalkanes with diamine. Moreover, they introduced
the so-called H-value, defined as the ppm content of partially hydrogenated
perfluoroalkanes as a PFCL safety criterion, and attributed an H-value
less than 10 ppm as the safety threshold.7 However, the specificity of the chemical reaction leading to the
“H-value” determination included a very narrow range
of impurities, excluding a range of other potentially high cytotoxic
contaminants, among which the impurities were identified by Pastor
et al.3 in Ala Octa PFO.

To determine
the hydrogen content (H-content) of a wider range
of partially hydrogenated compounds in PFCLs, we evaluated the possibility
to use 1H NMR spectroscopy. This is a powerful technique
for elucidating the structure of organic compounds. Furthermore, 1H NMR can be applied as a quantitative analytical technique
because the intensity of the NMR signal is proportional to the number
of nuclei and consequently to the amount of analytes.8,9 Quantitative NMR (qNMR) gives accurate and precise results when
internal standards are used10,11 because the concentration
of the analytes is directly determined via the integral value ratio.
Owing to the properties of qNMR, this technique has been used to determine
the impurities of pharmaceutical products12 and to quantify analytes to prepare calibration solution for instrumental
analysis.13 Previously, Chang et al.14 used 1,4-bis(trichloromethyl)benzene (TCMB)
in deuterated benzene as an external proton standard. Indeed, its
use as the internal standard was precluded because of the physicochemical
properties of PFCLs.15 To improve the accuracy
and precision of qNMR assays, we evaluated the feasibility of the
use of pulse length-based concentration (PULCON) determination methodology,16 which correlates the absolute intensities in
two 1D-NMR spectra via the principle of reciprocity,17 to determine the protonated impurity in commercially available
PFCL medical devices. This methodology was recently implemented in
Bruker TopSpin software under the electronic reference to access in
vivo concentration 2 (ERETIC2)18 commercial
name. Despite the usefulness of this method, only few studies on qNMR
have been reported.19−22

In order to investigate the relation between H-content and
cytotoxicity,
samples of PFO were contaminated with different concentrations of
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) corresponding to the compound with very
low H-content and two partially hydrogenated PFO analogues, HPFO and
5HPFO, corresponding to the compounds with high H-content. Both PFOA
and HPFO were previously described as toxic PFCL manufacturing residues.3 In addition to PFO-contaminated samples, 15 commercially
available PFO or perfluorodecalin (PFD) medical devices, routinely
used during vitreous surgery, were analyzed, and the H-content expressed
as ppm of H was determined. In PFO-contaminated samples and 15 commercial
medical devices, the correlation between H-content and the in vitro
cytotoxicity test in ARPE-19 and BALB 3T3 cell lines performed according
to ISO 10993-55 was investigated in order
to evaluate the relevance of H-content value as a safety criterion
for PFCL medical devices intended for intraocular use.

Results
Performance
Tests of the ERETIC2 Method with Different Analytes
Two partially
hydrogenated PFO analogs, HPFO and 5HPFO, were initially
analyzed. Their 1H NMR spectra in PFO are reported in Figures
S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum of HPFO is characterized
by a triplet of triplets (Figure S1) centered
at 5.97 ppm with a coupling constant J of 52.3 and
4.0 Hz owing to the coupling of the H nucleus with the geminal and
vicinal fluorine atoms, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum
of 5HPFO exhibits a −CH3 triplet centered at 1.22
ppm (J 7.5 Hz) and a −CH2 multiplet
(doublet of quartets) centered at 2.16 ppm, containing the contribution
of both H–H and H–F couplings.

The two PFO analyte
solutions were quantified by the ERETIC2 method using the well-separated
signals at 5.97 and 2.16 ppm for HPFO and 5HPFO, respectively, and
a 1.26 mM HPFO solution in PFO as a reference. The determined concentration
(average of three replicated measurements ± S.D.) of analytes
gave sufficient recovery (Table 1). The average recovery was 99.7 and 99.9% for HPFO
and 5HPFO, respectively, indicating that the ERETIC2 method allows
the quantification of partially hydrogenated perfluoroalkyl analogs
in the perfluorinated solvent. The relation between the concentration
determined by gravimetric and ERETIC2 methods was plotted in Figure S3. The linear regression analysis (y = 0.960x, R2 = 0.9995 and y = 1.019x, R2 = 0.9996, for HPFO and 5HPFO, respectively)
indicated that ERETIC2 gives better linearity and accuracy than the
gravimetric method according to the data obtained by Frank et al.19 in the quantification of benzoic acid, caffeine,
and l-tyrosine.

Comparison of Analyte Concentrations between the ERETIC2 and
External Standard Method
The two analytes—HPFO and
5HPFO—were alternatively quantified using TCMB as an external
standard14 (Table 1, and see Supporting Information for an exhaustive description of the procedure).

The relation between the average concentrations calculated using
TCMB as the external reference compound and ERETIC2 method was plotted
(Figure S4). The R2 values were 0.9995 and 0.9996 with a slope of 0.967 and 0.961
in the analysis of HPFO and 5HPFO, respectively, indicating that ERETIC2
gives better linearity and accuracy than the external standard method.

Cytotoxicity Analysis of PFO Contaminated with Compounds Having
Different H-Contents
The cytotoxicity of PFO solutions contaminated
with either some manufacturing contaminants described by Pastor et
al.3 (PFOA and HPFO) or 5HPFO has been
evaluated, according to ISO 10993-5,5 and
compared with their H-content (Table 2).

a According to the direct contact
test (ISO 10993-5), a sample was cytotoxic if cell viability reduction
was greater than 30%. Contaminants were dissolved in PFO (purity 99.8%,
AL.CHI.MI.A S.r.l, Italy). ND: not determined.

The PFO sample contaminated with
57 ppm of PFOA (0.0057%), corresponding
to an H-content of 0.13 ppm, was strongly cytotoxic and showed 42
and 35% reduction of cell viability in ARPE-19 and BALB 3T3 cells
after 24 h of treatment, respectively. The cytotoxicity test demonstrated
that 28 ppm PFOA (H-content of 0.07 ppm) induced cytotoxicity in ARPE-19
cells (but not in BALB-3T3 cells) with a reduction of cell viability
of 38% (Table 2), suggesting
different sensibility of these cell lines towards PFOA. To obtain
a similar reduction of cell viability of ARPE-19 cells (44%) by the
HPFO contaminant, a 12.3000% solution of HPFO in PFO (H-content of
295.13 ppm) was necessary. In these conditions, BALB 3T3 cells showed
a reduction of cell viability of 48%, resulting in more sensitivity
to contaminant. At lower concentrations of HPFO (6.1500 and 3.0750%,
corresponding to H-content values of 147.56 and 73.78 ppm), BALB 3T3
cell lines confirmed its greater resistance to the cytotoxic effects
of this contaminant. 5HPFO solutions showed high H-content from 2808.65
to 702.16 ppm and resulted in noncytotoxicity at all tested concentrations
(Table 2).

Cytotoxicity
and qNMR Analysis of PFO and PFD Medical Devices
The H-content
and cytotoxicity of 15 commercially available PFO
and PFD medical devices were determined and compared. Proton resonances
were detectable in the chemical shift region associated with hydrogen-containing
fluorocarbons (2–6.5 ppm),23 and
at lower δ than the water signal, corresponding to the general
hydrocarbon-type impurities (as example, the 1H NMR spectrum
of the PFO2 device is reported in Figure S5). The proton amount, excluding the residual proton of both deuterochloroform
lock solvent and water, is reported in Table 3.

a According to the
direct contact
test (ISO 10993-5), a sample was cytotoxic if cell viability reduction
was greater than 30%. ND: not determined.

PFD medical devices showed an H-content in the range
from 3.5 to
11.8 ppm, and all the samples were not cytotoxic in the two tested
cell lines. Commercially available PFO devices showed an H-content
in the range from 2.5 to 8.2 ppm with the exception of PFO1 and PFO2
that were characterized by an H-content of 67.97 and 54.11 ppm, respectively.
Only these two PFO medical devices, analyzed by the direct contact
cytotoxicity test, resulted in cytotoxicity with a reduction of cell
viability of 56 and 31% in ARPE-19 cells for PFO1 and PFO2, respectively.
PFO1 was cytotoxic also in BALB 3T3 cells, while no data were available
for the PFO2 sample with this cell line. All other analyzed PFO medical
devices did not significantly reduce the cell viability after 24 h
of direct contact and were not cytotoxic (Table 3).

Correlation between Cell Toxicity and H-Content
of PFCL Compounds
To evaluate any relation between the cytotoxicity
data obtained
in both cell lines for all the investigated PFCL compounds and the
respective H-content determined by qNMR, a linear regression fit was
performed. In the case of commercially available PFCL medical devices
reported in Table 3, a significant correlation was found for the abovementioned parameters
in both cell lines, being the calculated Pearson’s correlation
coefficient r = 0.8820 (p < 0.0001)
for ARPE-19 cells and r = 0.9718 (p < 0.0001) for BALB-3T3 cells as shown in Figure 1. In contrast, using the same approach, no
significant correlation was found between the H-content and cytotoxicity
of PFO solutions containing PFOA, HPFO, or 5HPFO (Figure S6). Indeed, while PFOA is cytotoxic with a very low
concentration (28 ppm) and HPFO is at a concentration of 12.30%, 5HPFO
does not show any cytotoxicity in all the range of concentration examined
and as a pure compound.

Figure 1 Correlation between H-content of analyzed PFO
and PFD samples with
cytotoxicity determined in ARPE-19 (left panel) and BALB-3T3 (right
panel) cells. Shaded areas show the confidence intervals for the fitted
lines. A significant correlation was found for both cell lines (for
ARPE-19 cells: r = 0.8820, p <
0.0001; for BALB-3T3 cells: r = 0.9718, p < 0.0001).

Moreover, the presence of a significant
correlation only in commercially
available PFCL medical devices was confirmed by a nonparametric evaluation
of data; hierarchical clustering (Ward’s method) of samples
according to their cytotoxicity and H-content gave consistent results
in both cell lines (Figures 2 and 3). For the ARPE-19 cell line,
four distinguishable clusters were detected; particularly, the cluster
comprising PFO1 and PFO2, characterized by relevant cytotoxicity (>30%)
according to ISO 10993-5, was well enucleated from the other clusters
that presented a low H-content and moderate/low cytotoxicity. Similar
behavior was found for BALB-3T3 cells, although the incomplete data
set was available.

Discussion and Conclusions
Toxic effects correlated with
prolonged use of PFCLs are very well
known since the beginning of the nineties of the last century; however,
these molecules are considered safe and well tolerated for a short
time of use. Early studies demonstrated that PFO is not toxic after
48 h of treatment in the rabbit vitreous cavity.14 Moreover, in vitro experiments using fibroblasts demonstrated
that their reduction of attachment and growth rate was because of
the presence of partially fluorinated impurities and not PFCLs themselves.2 However, several studies claimed the possibility
of retinal toxic effects.14,24 Indeed, it is well
known that the retained PFO at the vitreous cavity may activate inflammation,24−26 even if the origin of this intolerance is unclear. Some authors
correlate the chemical toxicity in animals to the impurities of PFCLs
that can cause the formation of a protein film for epiretinal membrane
formation in animals.27,28 In recent years, some cases of
adverse reactions of PFCLs and particularly of PFO have been reported.
In 2013, toxic effects related to the use of PFO were reported in
Chile and Spain, which were attributed to the careless manipulation
of the product.3 Recently, a case of PFO
toxicity has been reported, and toxicological investigation demonstrated
that in addition to organic contaminants, toxic polar compounds appeared
during storage because of PFCL oxidation due to either incomplete
purification of the synthesized product or inadequate storage.2,27 The risk of the presence or appearance of toxic substances necessitates
the development of analytical methods of PFCLs and related safety
criteria for their clinical use.

Menz et al.7 proposed the analysis of
partially hydrogenated perfluoroalkanes correlating the fluorine ions
released via the reaction with hexamethylenediamine of partially hydrogenated
PCFLs to the content in hydrogenated compounds. Based on this method,
they proposed a partially hydrogenated perfluoroalkane content of
less than 10 ppm as a safety criterion for PFCL medical devices. Unfortunately,
the mechanism of this reaction requires the presence of a CHF–CF2 moiety to proceed with the stoichiometry proposed by Menz,
whereas other partially hydrogenated PFCLs and contaminants found
in cytotoxic PFO medical devices would not react or would react with
a different stoichiometry; thus, it leads to an incorrect determination
of the content of partially hydrogenated compounds.

In the present
study, we have developed and validated a method
based on the quantitative analysis of 1H NMR spectra of
perfluorinated compounds to determine a large range of possible impurities
present in PFCLs. The proposed method permitted to detect not only
partially fluorinated compounds also detectable by the method proposed
by Menz et al.7 but also partially hydrogenated
perfluoroalkanes and other cytotoxic compounds that would not react
with hexamethylenediamine. Therefore, the present method would also
detect PFOA, perfluoroalkyl alcohols, and benzene derivatives described
by Pastor et al.3 as contaminants of Ala
Octa devices used in the patient adverse events. Such impurities may
have been formed because of PFCL oxidation or may be residues derived
from the PFCL manufacturing processes. The determination of the presence
of different classes of hydrogenated molecules in PFCLs by a single
analysis is the strength of this method. Moreover, this technique
can provide useful information on the stability of PFCLs during storage.
We analyzed 15 PFCL medical devices for clinical use in retinal surgery
currently available on the market for both the H-content and cytotoxicity.
Significant correlation demonstrated between the H-content and cytotoxicity
of analyzed products allowed us to suppose that the H-content could
be used to indirectly define the cytotoxicity of PFCL medical devices
as previously suggested by Menz et al.7 However, the hypothesis had to be strongly rejected when PFCL samples,
contaminated with highly toxic impurities previously detected in Ala
Octa devices,3 were analyzed for both the
H-content and cytotoxicity. A very high cytotoxicity was obtained
in samples contaminated with PFOA, while showing extremely low H-content
(0.13 and 0.07 ppm). Conversely, in the PFCL samples contaminated
with 5HPFO showing a high H-content (up to 2800 ppm), the cytotoxicity
was not detected. Hence a correlation between H-content and cytotoxicity
could not be confirmed in these samples having low and high H-content.
Therefore according to our study, H-content cannot be used as a safety
criterion to determine PFCL safety.

Overall, these data indicated
that the quantification of partially
hydrogenated compounds is not sufficient to determine the safety of
PFCLs. Despite the fact that the qNMR analysis, which is developed
and validated in the present study, could reliably determine the presence
of impurities in the tested samples and could warn about possible
undesired contamination, it could not directly provide any information
about the toxicity of such impurities. Therefore, the cytotoxicity
test in vitro remains the only method that can directly assess the
cytotoxicity of total impurities present in the samples and demonstrate
the toxicity or safety of the product.

In conclusion, the toxicity
of PFCL medical devices, related to
chemical contaminants due to either an incomplete purification or
unsuitable storage conditions of the raw materials, could be prevented
by systematic cytotoxicity testing of PFCL medical device batches
before their release for sale, in addition to physicochemical analyses
of raw materials during manufacturing processes. We demonstrated that
the H-content alone could not predict and guarantee the safety of
the PFCL product. The direct information on the safety of the product
in vitro can be provided only by the cytotoxicity test, provided the
validation of the method considering the particular specifications
and conditions of use of the PFCLs.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
PFOA, HPFO, and 5HPFO were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (Italy). PFO and PFD medical devices intended for intraocular
use were procured from local distributors (suppliers are indicated
from 1 to 8). Deuterated chloroform (100 atom % D) was purchased from
Armar AG (Switzerland). The reference compound TCMB was obtained from
Acros Organics (Belgium).

qNMR Analysis
All NMR spectra were
acquired via a Bruker
AVANCE III HD spectrometer (1H: 400 MHz) with a BBI probe (Bruker
BioSpin, Germany) using Wilmad coaxial NMR tubes (inner tube 2.97
mm × 1.96 mm, O.D. × I.D.) at 298 K. The data acquisition
and data processing were performed using TopSpin 3.0 software (Bruker
BioSpin). Prior to the data acquisition, the 90° pulse length
was calibrated. Each sample was well tuned and matched manually. The
acquisition parameters used for performance tests were set as follows:
pulse sequence, zg; relaxation delay (D1), 6 s; spectral width (SW), 14 ppm; data acquisition time (AQ),
3 s; dummy scans (DS), 8; number of scans (NS), 1700; spinning, OFF.
RG was automatically set by TopSpin 3.0 software (RG: 203).

The obtained NMR spectra were processed by multiplying with exponential
(0.3 Hz line broadening) and zero-filling. The phases were corrected
manually; subsequently, the baseline was corrected by a fifth-order
polynomial. Peak integration was manually selected. The slope and
bias corrections of the integral were not used. The concentration
of the analyte was quantified via the ERETIC2 method in TopSpin 3.0
software. Individual integral values, concentration, and the number
of protons in the signal used for quantitation in the reference were
entered in PULCON software; further, the concentration of the signal
in the sample was automatically calculated.

Alternatively, the
concentration was quantified via the external
standard method by dissolving 87.5 mg of TCMB in 10 mL of CDCl3 and then diluted until the final amount of the reference
compound was 79.69 μM.

Direct Contact Cytotoxicity Test in Vitro
The human
retinal pigment epithelial cell lines ARPE-19 (ATCC CRL-2302, Manassas
VA, USA) and BALB 3T3 (ATCC CCL-163, Manassas VA, USA) were grown
as a monolayer in a vehicle medium containing DMEM/nutrient mixture
F-12 medium with l-glutamine and without HEPES (Gibco, Italy),
each supplemented with 10% of iron-fortified bovine calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). ARPE-19 cell
suspension containing 2.0–3.0 × 105 cells/mL
was seeded into 96-well microtiter plates, grown to 70–80%
confluence, and washed once with 150 μL of Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline containing MgCl2 and CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich) before the application of test samples.

Ultrapure PFO, purity 99.8%, (AL.CHI.MI.A S.r.l, Italy), and HPFO
with purity 98.8% (Fluorochem, Italy) were used as positive and negative
controls, respectively. Contact time and area between the sample and
cells corresponded to 24 h and 60% area (50 μL), respectively.
The samples were deposited directly on the cells with the tip immersed
in the medium at 2/3rd depth of the well to obtain constant contact
with the cell layer.

TOX-1 in vitro toxicology assay kit, the
MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-phenyltetrazolium
bromide)-based (Sigma-Aldrich) vitality assay was used to quantify
ARPE-19 cell viability. The cells were examined microscopically (Leica
DM IL LED, Germany) by two independent operators before sample removal
and after the phase of dye extraction and cell fixing in the MTT assay.
The reactivity zone under and around the sample was graded according
to ISO 10993-5.5 Grade 4 was not applicable
in our testing conditions. The achievement of a numerical grade greater
than 2 was considered as a cytotoxic effect. At least six values were
acquired at two different 96-well microplates for all samples (vehicle,
positive control, and negative control). Mean % of cell mortality
and standard error of the mean were calculated for each sample and
experimental condition. Reduction in cell vitality greater than 30%
was considered to be a cytotoxic effect.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed
using JMP13 software for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Relations
between pairs of variables were tested by least-squares linear regression.
Pearson’s correlation coefficient r was used
to quantify the strength of the relations. A p <
0.05 was considered as statistically significant. To classify the
investigated PFCL compounds according to the pattern of their H-content
and cytotoxicity, a procedure of hierarchical unsupervised clustering
was also used. The linkage rule was according to the Ward’s
method on standardized data, and the distance measure was determined
by the standardized Euclidean distance.
