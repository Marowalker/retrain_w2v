The creaming behavior of a turbid
oil-in-water emulsion was observed
via the processes of multiphoton ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(MPI-TOFMS) and ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry (UV–vis),
and the results were compared. The transmittance measurement by UV–vis
showed that the turbidity of the toluene emulsion was decreased with
time. However, non-negligible errors are common in the measurement
of a sample with high turbidity. The online measurement by MPI-TOFMS
detected many spikes in the time profile, which revealed the existence
of toluene droplets in the emulsion. A smooth time profile suggested
that the signal intensity had initially increased, and then decreased
with time; the initial concentration of toluene was 3 g/L, which had
decreased by half after 60 min. The signal behavior obtained using
MPI-TOFMS differed only slightly from that obtained using UV–vis.
Since a change in turbidity is not the same as a change in the local
concentration of an oil component, MPI-TOFMS is useful for the analysis
of a turbid emulsion and offers additional information concerning
the creaming phenomenon of an emulsion.

==== Body
Introduction
An emulsion is a system
in which one liquid is dispersed with another
and both are immiscible. Emulsions are applied in a wide variety of
fields; many types of emulsion products are commercialized such as
inks, paints, foods, cosmetics, and pesticide spraying agents.

An emulsion has several specific characteristics that differentiate
it from a so-called normal solution. For example, differences in the
preparation conditions affect the properties even if the concentrations
of the constituents are the same. Moreover, several collapse processes
exist in an emulsion such as creaming, aggregation, coalescence, and
Ostwald ripening. These processes are sensitive to the constituents
and their concentrations, as well as to the preparation conditions.
Among the collapse processes, creaming is a phenomenon wherein the
emulsion droplets are moved to the upper or lower portions according
to the differences in density between the dispersed phase and the
continuous phase. The rate of creaming is affected by the droplet
size, the viscosity of the dispersed phase, and so on. In any case,
the condition of an emulsion changes with time. Also, collapse processes
change the qualities of an emulsion product.

Recent analytical
studies of emulsions include evaluations of collapse
processes,1,2 analysis of the interface of droplets,3−5 and analysis of emulsion products.6 Turbidity
measured by ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry (UV–vis)
has normally been used for the evaluation of emulsion stability.7−10 For instance, the time profile of turbidity was studied to evaluate
the coalescence and/or solubilization kinetics of oil in microemulsion
droplets11,12 and for determining the phase-inversion
temperature.13,14 However, when an incident light
insufficiently passes through an emulsion with rather high turbidity,
it is difficult to obtain reliable data. In the case of an oil-in-water
(O/W) emulsion, a higher concentration of an oil constituent generally
causes higher turbidity, although several other factors can also affect
the turbidity. In a normal solution with higher absorbance due to
a higher concentration, the solution should be normally diluted when
measuring transmittance and absorbance. However, in the case of an
emulsion, the size of droplets and the emulsion properties are changed
by dilution. As a result, the original behavior of a collapse process
cannot be evaluated.

Multiphoton ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (MPI-TOFMS)
has several notable and practical characteristics. The ionization
method uses ultraviolet laser pulses with high optical selectivity
and less contamination, although soot is often produced by electron
ionization sources. Moreover, TOFMS can detect all of the induced
ions in principle, and is a robust and reasonably easy way to accomplish
design and handling.15−18 MPI-TOFMS is normally applied to atomic/molecular spectroscopy19−21 and to the trace analysis of compounds in real samples such as in
an environmental setting.22−27 Although MPI is generally an ionization method for analytes in a
gas phase, several vaporization methods for liquid samples have also
been studied.28−30

Recently, we applied MPI-TOFMS to the online
analysis of an emulsion.31−37 We developed a sample introduction technique for an emulsion, and
the online mass analysis of an oil phase in an O/W emulsion without
pretreatment was achieved.31 We reported
the time profile of a peak area of an analyte, which was constructed
by plotting the peak areas of the corresponding ions in a series of
mass spectra. Spikes often appear in time profiles, particularly when
measuring an emulsion with a white turbidity. Such spikes derive from
oil droplets, and, in the case of a toluene O/W emulsion, we calculated
the minimum diameter of a toluene droplet that could be detected as
a spike.35,36 We also reported an online analysis of multiple
components in an O/W emulsion34 and that
of a multiple emulsion.33 We recently used
a styrene O/W emulsion to achieve a quantitative analysis of the oil
component in an O/W emulsion, and obtained a linear calibration curve
of styrene in a concentration of as much as 5 g/L.37

Thus far, the possibility of using MPI-TOFMS to evaluate
the creaming
of an emulsion has only been suggested.31 In the present study, the time profiles of an O/W emulsion exhibiting
a creaming phenomenon were measured by UV–vis and MPI-TOFMS,
and the monitoring of an emulsion in a cuvette via these two types
of measurement was aligned. Comparable results established the utility
of MPI-TOFMS for the evaluation of creaming.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Sample Preparation
Toluene and sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS), as an oil phase and an emulsifier, respectively,
were purchased from WAKO Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan) and
were used without further purification. Purified water was prepared
in our laboratory.

For the sample preparation, first, water
(20 mL) and SDS were added to a vial that was shaken manually until
the solid SDS was dissolved. Then, toluene was added and stirred with
a homogenizer (AHG-160D, AS ONE, Osaka) at a speed of 5000 rpm for
10 min. The concentrations of both toluene and SDS were 3 g/L with
respect to the water. After stirring, 3.5 mL of the prepared sample
was transferred to a 5 mL cuvette.

UV–Vis
To establish the degree of turbidity,
UV–vis transmittance was measured with a spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu, UV-160, Japan). To suppress the vaporization of toluene,
a cuvette with a lid was placed on the holder of the spectrophotometer.
As will be described later, a local region of the sample in a cuvette
was monitored by MPI-TOFMS. Therefore, when measuring turbidity, a
horizontal slit (2 mm in width) was placed in the front of the cuvette,
as shown in Figure 1a, in a region where the transmittance measurement was limited in
terms of height. As a result, the incident light passed through the
region 1.8–2.0 cm from the bottom of the cuvette.

Figure 1 Experimental
setup. (a) Horizontal slit (2 mm in width) was placed
in the front of a cuvette when using UV–vis. The incident light
was passed through a region 1.8–2.0 cm from the bottom of the
cuvette. (b) Emulsion in a cuvette with a lid that had a small hole
(φ 1 mm) was monitored by MPI-TOFMS. The tip of the capillary
column was set at the same height as that of the transmittance measurement,
i.e., ca. 2 cm from the bottom of the cuvette.

The wavelengths of the incident light were set to 600 and
266 nm.
While each constituent in an emulsion had no absorption in terms of
its former wavelength, the absorption for toluene was in the latter
wavelength, which approximated the wavelength of the laser pulse for
MPI. In the present study, the turbidity was expressed by −log I/I0, where I and I0 were the incident light intensity
and the transmitted light intensity, respectively.

MPI-TOFMS
MPI-TOFMS used in the present study is described
in detail elsewhere,31 and only briefly
discussed here. The sample introduction port was composed of a pair
of concentric capillary columns. An emulsion was placed in a cuvette
with a lid that had a small hole (1 mm in diameter) to suppress the
vaporization of toluene as much as possible. An inner capillary column
was inserted through the hole to introduce an emulsion. The tip of
the capillary column was set at the same height as the region of the
transmittance measurement described previously, i.e., ca. 2 cm from
the bottom of the cuvette. Ambient air flowed through an outer capillary
column, and the flow rate was adjusted to 2 mL/min via a flow meter
(RK-1250, Kofloc, Kyoto, Japan). The pressure of the vacuum chamber
was ca. 1 × 10–2 Pa.

The linear-type
TOFMS used in the present study was developed at Kyushu University,
Japan. The fourth-harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser (GAIA II, 266 nm, 4 ns,
10 Hz, Rayture Systems, Tokyo, Japan) was used for ionization. The
laser pulse, which was adjusted to ca. 20 μJ, was focused with
a plano-convex lens (f = 200 mm). The ion signals
were acquired without averaging every 0.1 s via a 1 GHz digitizer
(AP240, 1 GS/s, Acqiris/Agilent Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). The mass
resolution was typically 220 at m/z 92 when measuring a toluene O/W emulsion with a white turbidity
(see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).
The time profile for toluene shown in Figure 4a was constructed by plotting the sum of
the peak areas of m/z 92 (a molecular
ion) and m/z 91 (a fragment ion)
on a series of mass spectra. Figure 4b shows the time profile for the average of every 1200
plots, which corresponded to every 120 s, applied in the three experiments
including that in Figure 4a. It should be noted that the flow of ambient air did not
influence the time profile of the peak area of toluene, as shown in Figure 4, but was used simply
to stably introduce an emulsion into TOFMS.

Results and Discussion
Features
of an Emulsion
The features of the emulsion
prepared in a cuvette with time are shown in Figure 2. Just after the preparation, the emulsion
developed a white turbidity, the lower portion of which turned slightly
transparent with time, while the turbidity in the middle portion,
monitored using UV–vis and MPI-TOFMS in the present study,
seemed unchanged.

Figure 2 Photograph of an O/W emulsion with time.

Time Profile of Turbidity by UV–Vis
Figure 3 shows the
results
of transmittance measurement obtained by UV–vis where the wavelength
of the incident light was 600 nm. This indicates the turbidity of
an emulsion because the three constituents of the present emulsion,
i.e., toluene, water, and SDS, each had no absorption. In this study,
the turbidity of the first 5 min was seldom unchanged or was slightly
decreased, and was then clearly decreased with time at the height
of the monitoring position, although the change in turbidity could
not be confirmed by the naked eye (Figure 2). In this manner, the UV–vis time
profile measurement of turbidity was useful for evaluating the creaming
in an emulsion. However, as shown in Figure 3, the value of turbidity (−log I/I0) was more than 1.0 during
the first 35 min. That is, the transmittance was less than 10%, which
means that the incident light was seldom transmitted through the emulsion.
In conventional UV–vis spectroscopy, such an experimental condition
often results in an increase in the incidence of errors. That is,
non-negligible errors easily occur in the measurement of a sample
with turbidity such as the one in this study.

Figure 3 Time profile of the turbidity
of an O/W emulsion measured by UV–vis
at 600 nm. The error indicates the standard deviation (n = 3).

Incidentally, the value of −log I/I0 obtained at 266 nm was
saturated
at 2.1 throughout the measurement time because, in addition to the
presence of turbidity, toluene has absorption at this wavelength.
As a result, the creaming of the present emulsion could not be evaluated
using the transmittance at this wavelength. Therefore, it is quite
difficult to use UV–vis to explain the relationship between
the local concentration of a constituent of a dispersed phase and
the creaming phenomenon. The proper absorbance might have been obtained
by adding water to dilute toluene and also to reduce the turbidity,
but the properties of the resultant diluted emulsion, including any
creaming behavior, would surely be changed. A shortening of the light
path is one possible experimental condition that could enhance transmittance,
which could allow an estimation of the concentration. However, the
use of a thinner cuvette would be impractical and would likely influence
the creaming phenomenon of the emulsion because situations such as
convection differ between a thin cuvette and the rather large storage
containers that are used in practical situations.

Time Profile
of the Concentration of the Oil Phase by MPI-TOFMS
A time
profile of the peak area of toluene obtained by online MPI-TOFMS
is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the results of a time profile without averaging.
In this measurement, the recording began at the same time that the
capillary column was inserted into an emulsion. In Figure 4a, although the signal for
toluene was very small, it was surely found after ca. 100–113
s in three measurements and was then adopted as the time required
for sample introduction. After that, many spikes appeared on the time
profile, which decreased both in number and intensity with time. The
appearance of spikes suggested the existence of highly concentrated
toluene, i.e., toluene droplets.31,35 In the present
study, the number and size of the toluene droplets seemed to decrease
at the monitoring position in the cuvette with the occurrence of the
creaming of an emulsion.

Figure 4 Time profile of the peak area of toluene in
an O/W emulsion measured
by MPI-TOFMS. (a) Time profile recorded without averaging (by every
0.1 s). (b) Time profile of an average of every 1200 plots, which
corresponds to every 120 s, was applied in three experiments including
that in (a). The first plot (corresponding to the average of the first
120 s) was ignored because a time from 0 to ca. 120 s was required
to pass the sample through the capillary column (see the text). The
intensity of the second plot was set to 100%, and the right-hand scale
indicates the concentration of toluene where an intensity of 100%
is compatible with 3 g/L of toluene (see the text). The error indicates
the standard deviation (n = 3).

Next, an average of every 1200 plots, which corresponded
to every
120 s, was re-plotted. The time profile is shown in Figure 4b. The first plot (corresponding
to the average value of the first 120 s) was ignored (masked) because
a time that ranged from 0 to ca. 120 s was required for the sample
to pass through the capillary column. In addition, the average intensity
of the second plot was set to 100% in Figure 4b.

Previously, we reported the quantitative
analysis of an O/W emulsion
wherein a linear calibration curve of the oil phase of styrene in
an emulsion with up to 5 g/L was obtained.37 Although toluene was used in the present study, the results in Figure 4b suggest a change
in the concentration of toluene at the sampling position. The concentration
of toluene at the beginning of the measurement was 3 g/L. In this
figure, the right-hand scale indicates the concentration of toluene
where a signal intensity of 100% is compatible with 3 g/L of toluene.

Interestingly, the concentration increased ca. 25% during the first
few minutes, which could have been due to the introduction of a large
number of, and/or a large size of, toluene droplets. After that, the
concentration of toluene decreased at a rate of ca. 0.2 g/(L min)
from 8 to 16 min. Finally, the signal intensity was decreased by half
compared with the initial (at 2 min) signal intensity, which amounted
to a decrease of ca. 1.5 g/L after 60 min. These toluene concentrations
were still rather high and not suitable for the measurement of absorbance
by UV–vis at 266 nm, and, of course, the decrease in transmittance
that was caused by turbidity should also be taken into account. In
this manner, the creaming behavior can be quantitatively evaluated
using MPI-TOFMS, which can demonstrate the advantage of the present
method.

The changes in the signal intensities obtained by UV–vis
(Figure 3) and MPI-TOFMS
(Figure 4b) differed
slightly. That is, the turbidity was either almost constant or slightly
decreased for the first few minutes when using UV–vis, while
the concentration was somewhat increased when using MPI-TOFMS. Although
further studies are needed, one conceivable reason is as follows.
The present emulsion had a white turbidity and was polydispersed,
and at the monitoring point in the middle part of the cuvette, relatively
large oil droplets, which were moved from a lower position, were first
detected by MPI-TOFMS. Therefore, the local concentration in the middle
portion was increased first. This concentration change, however, only
scarcely contributed to the turbidity. In addition, assuming that
the latter part of the results (from 14 min or later) of Figures 3 and 4b were a single exponential decay, the decay time constants
were calculated to be 34 and 10 min, respectively. In this manner,
the differences in behavior between the turbidity and the concentration
could be detected.

MPI-TOFMS directly provides information concerning
the concentration
of an oil component in an emulsion. This method can also be used to
monitor the multiple constituents in an emulsion.33,34 Therefore, the influence of creaming on each constituent would be
evaluated. We are now studying the formulation for the signal behavior
obtained by MPI-TOFMS for a quantitative evaluation of the creaming
of an emulsion.

Conclusions
In the present study,
an O/W emulsion that showed creaming was
measured via UV–vis and MPI-TOFMS. Transmittance measurement
provided information concerning turbidity, but the measurement of
emulsions with higher levels of turbidity is difficult in principle.
On the other hand, with online mass analysis using MPI-TOFMS, the
change in the concentration of an oil phase accompanied by creaming
could be evaluated. The tendency of the change in the signal intensities
obtained from both methods was slightly different, which suggested
that the two methods provided different information, i.e., the turbidity
and the local concentration of an oil phase. The information for a
local concentration that was obtained by MPI-TOFMS would be difficult
to obtain via conventional UV–vis, which makes MPI-TOFMS a
useful tool for the evaluation of the collapse process of an emulsion.
