Introduction
Bis-heterocycles are
molecules that can be formed by two linked,
bound, spacer, or fused heterocyclic scaffolds. The purpose behind
the combination of two heterocycles is to improve their potential
applications in different areas such as chelating agents and metal
ligands, complexes or metal–organic framework precursors, as
well as electrical materials, and mainly in the development of bioactive
molecules and drugs.1−3 In this context, tetrazolo[1,5-a]quinolines4−6 and imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles7 are important fused heterocycles that exhibit
a wide variety of biological activities. For example, imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole I demonstrated to be a potent antidiabetic,8 benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole II displayed a strong antifungal
activity compared to standard fluconazole,9 and compound III showed an antibacterial activity comparable
to that of ampicillin (Figure 1).10

Figure 1 Target compounds and
some bis-heterocycles with biological activity.

The common methodologies to synthesize tetrazolo[1,5-a]quinolines need harsh conditions.11,12 Recently,
the synthesis of the fused tetrazolo[1,5-a]quinoline
scaffold using trimethylsilyl azide, a less toxic azide source, at
room temperature (RT) in quantitative yield through a SNAr/ring-chain azido-tautomerization process was reported.13 Among the one-pot reported methods for the synthesis
of imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles and their benzo[d]fused analogues, the common method consists of the construction
of an imidazole ring, which involves the condensation of 2-aminothiazole
derivatives with 1,2-difunctionalized units, such as α-haloketones
or α-haloesters.14,15 However, these methodologies
have disadvantages such as low to moderate yields, use of toxic chemicals,
reflux conditions, and limited substrate scope.

The Groebke–Blackburn–Bienaymé
reaction (GBBR)16−18 is one of the most important class of isocyanide-based
multicomponent
reactions (IMCRs)19−22 and one of the most efficient methods for the synthesis of fused
imidazo heterocycles.23 The GBBR takes
place between an aldehyde, 2-aminoazine, and an isocyanide, generally
in the presence of a suitable catalyst, such as Brønsted acids,
Lewis acids, ionic liquids, solid-supported acids, and miscellaneous
and organic bases.24,25 Particularly, only two reports
describing the synthesis of imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles
and their benzo[d]fused analogues using different
catalysts, such as Yb(OTf)326 and H3PO4/Al2O3,27 under solvent-free conditions are available.
However, these methods have limitations such as high temperatures,
the use of some expensive catalysts, and nonheterocyclic substituent
at C-3 of the imidazole ring. Interestingly, there is only one report
toward the synthesis of imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles in
water under catalyst-free conditions.28

It is highlighted that only one previously reported GBBR methodology
is available toward benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles 4a–e under solvent- and catalyst-free
conditions, which was carried out at 160 °C in good to excellent
yields (81–95%) (Scheme 1a).29 However, the scope was limited,
and the authors described only four examples, with less complexity
of the final compounds. Moreover, the use of high temperature and
limited substrate scope is the major drawbacks of this methodology.
It is noteworthy to mention that the use of heterocyclic aldehydes
in the GBBR for the synthesis of bound-type bis-heterocyclic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles analogues has been practically unexplored. In
this context, the 2-chloro-3-formyl-quinoline aldehyde has been used
in the GBBR under catalytic conditions such as γ-Fe2O3@HAp-Pr-NHSO3H30 or using stoichiometric amounts of ammonium chloride.31 However, the great disadvantage of these synthetic
protocols is the limited substrate scope toward imidazothiazoles.
Also, it is highlighted that in these protocols, the expensive and
noncommercial catalyst or nongreen solvent, long reaction times, and
high temperature were required.

Scheme 1 Closer and Previous Works Related
to the Synthesis of Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles and Benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles
As a part of our ongoing research program, in
past few years, we
have reported a novel one-pot synthesis based on IMCR methodologies
or strategies to synthesize bis-heterocycles containing scaffolds
of interest in medicinal chemistry, coordination chemistry, and in
optics.13,32−39 In 2016, we reported the one-pot synthesis of bound-type bis-heterocycles
containing the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole 8a–k and benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole
scaffolds 10a–l σ bound with different heterocycles,
under the catalyst-free microwave (MW)-assisted GBBR (Scheme 1b).40 It is important to mention that this later methodology represents
the first catalyst-free one-pot synthesis of bound-type bis-heterocycles
in which imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles were coupled with
various heterocyclic systems such as quinoline, chromone, and julolidine,
and the scope of this methodology was confirmed by the use of aldehydes
with different structural and electronic nature. To the best of our
knowledge, the synthesis of bound-type bis-heterocycles containing
imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole or benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole scaffolds and their analogues
coupled with complex heterocyclic substituent at the C-3 position
of the imidazole ring under green conditions via solvent- and catalyst-free
GBBR assisted by ultrasound irradiation (USI) has not yet been reported.
On the contrary, in all previously reported multicomponent reaction
(MCR) processes, to synthesize fused tetrazolo[1,5-a]quinolines analogues, the strategy report here is the first in which
the tetrazole ring was formed in situ and high complexity of the substituent
at the C-3 position of the quinoline ring was resulted from the functionalization
of aldehyde via the GBBR under green conditions.

The one-pot
synthesis of bound-type bis-heterocycles containing
imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles and their benzo[d]fused analogues via green or eco-friendly conditions involving the
strategy one-pot GBBR/post-transformations is an almost practically
unexplored field. Surprisingly, only one previously reported GBBR/Pictet–Spengler
strategy is available toward imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-based
polyheterocycles. However, the use of noncommercial heterogeneous
acid catalyst was necessary.41

As
far as we know, the one-pot green synthesis of fused tetrazolo[1,5-a]quinoline analogues functionalized with a heterocyclic
substituent at the C-3 position of the quinoline ring has not been
reported neither via one-pot nor stepwise methodology.

As a
part of our research program in the development of green or
eco-friendly strategies,13,42 herein, we describe
the catalyst- and solvent-free one-pot green synthesis of bis-heterocycles
containing two different fused heterocycles such as imidazo or benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles and 1,5-DsT with
quinoline moiety via the strategy one-pot GBBR/post-transformation
under mild and green conditions.

The efficient and novel one-pot
GBBR/post-transformation strategy
is a contribution in the design and development of the eco-friendly
IMCR strategies43 toward the synthesis
of bis-heterocycles (Figure 2), having the following advantages such as (a) it permits
functionalization at the C-3 position in both heterocycles (imidazole
and quinoline), (b) increases the complexity of the previously functionalized
heterocycle, (c) one-pot synthesis of two different fused heterocycles,
and (d) works under mild and green conditions. Thus, their application
to synthesize unsymmetrical bound-type bis-heterocycles containing
fused heterocycles as imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole and
1,5-DsT with quinoline via ultrasound-assisted one-pot GBBR/SNAr/ring-chain azido-tautomerization process under mild, catalyst-
and solvent-free conditions is described here. The combination of
GBBR with these processes improves their synthetic potential and increases
the molecular complexity of the GBB product. The latter one is resulting
from the synthesis of two fused heterocycles in the one-pot process
minimizing the use of reagents such as solvents and catalysts, which
are commonly needed in the GBBR (Scheme 1c).

Figure 2 Toward the synthesis of fused bis-heterocycles
via the developed
one-pot strategy based on GBBR and SNAr/ring-chain azido-tautomerization
post-transformations.

The USI is responsible for the cavitation effect, growth,
and implosive
collapse of bubbles in liquid. The USI in MCRs has emerged as a green
synthetic approach because of the milder reaction conditions, shorter
reaction times, and high yields.44 Reactions
in solvent-free and in high-viscosity solvents are favorable for sonication.45

Results and Discussion
In order
to find the optimum conditions for each of the three different
processes (GBBR/SNAr/ring-chain azido-tautomerization)
involved in the synthetic strategy toward the synthesis of unsymmetrical
bound-type bis-heterocycles 12a, 2-chloro-3-formyl-quinoline 5, 2-aminothiazole 7a, cyclohexyl isocyanide 6a, and TMSN311 were selected as
the model reaction (Table 1). In concordance with our main line research, green solvents
and moderate temperatures were studied to optimize the reaction conditions.
Initially, the one-pot process was carried out in water at RT (Table 1, entry 1) and under
heating (Table 1, entry
2). However, in both cases, the starting materials remained completely
unconsumed. When the reaction was carried out in ethanol at RT (Table 1, entry 3) and under
reflux conditions (Table 1, entry 4), the desired product 12a was obtained
in trace amount and 27% and in 43% after heating at 80 °C for
12 h under solvent-free conditions (Table 1, entry 5).

kHz). NR = no reaction.

The GBBR product was not achieved when the reaction was performed
in water under USI at RT (Table 1, entry 6). The same reaction in heating under USI
in water (Table 1,
entry 7) or ethanol (Table 1, entry 8) gave only trace and 15% of compound 12a. Under neat USI conditions at RT, only trace amount of product 12a was formed (Table 1, entry 9). To our delight, a further improvement was achieved
when the reaction was carried out at 60 °C under USI and solvent-free
conditions for 1 h, yielding the expected compound 12a in 91% (Table 1,
entry 10). Finally, we found the optimal conditions as follows: when 5 (1.0 equiv) reacted with 6a (1.0 equiv), 7a (1.0 equiv), and 11 (1.0 equiv) via catalyst-
and solvent-free conditions at 60 °C under USI (Table 1, entry 10).

Having optimized
reaction conditions, we next explored the scope
of the method by varying 2-aminoazines and isocyanides and keeping
the aldehyde component constant. As seen in Table 2, imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles 12a–h were synthesized in good to excellent yields
(84–98%). The best results were obtained by using 2-aminothiazole
or 2-aminothiazole-5-carbonitrile with cyclohexyl-, tert-butyl- and phenethyl isocyanide 90–98% (12a–c, 12e–g). On the other hand, the benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles 13a–h were synthesized in good to excellent yields (79–94%). Excellent
yields were obtained 91–94% in the case of 2-aminobenzothiazole
(13a–c). Slight lower yields 79–90% were
obtained after using 2-amino-6-fluorobenzothiazole (13e–h). Particularly, the use of p-methoxybenzyl isocyanide
produced the lowest yields 79–88% with all of the 2-aminoazines
(12d, 12h, 13d, and 13h).

Table 2 Substrate Scopea
a The reaction was carried out with
using equimolar quantities of 5, 6, 11, and 7 or 9.

Suitable crystal of compound 12b (Figure 3) was obtained, and the structure
was confirmed through X-ray diffraction analysis (CCDC 1582632; see
the Supporting Information for additional
details).

Figure 3 ORTEP diagram of compound 12b.

A plausible mechanism is outlined in Scheme 2. First, the GBBR mechanism starts with the
condensation of 2-aminothiazole 7a with aldehyde 5 to form imine 14, which may follow two possible
pathways to give the expected GBBR product. First, the well-documented
and previously suggested18 [4 + 1] cycloaddition
with isocyanide 6 (path A), and second, it may also undergo
nonconcerted path via α-isocyanide addition to form nitrilium
intermediate 15 followed by 5-exodig cyclization to afford
precursor 16 (path B).

Scheme 2 Plausible One-Pot
GBBR/SNAr/Ring-Chain Azido-Tautomerization
Mechanism
Recently, we have
reported the mechanistic computational studies
using DFT approach for the catalyst-free GBBR,40 where we found that only the nonconcerted pathway is allowed
under catalyst-free conditions. On the basis of these previous results,
we proposed that the reaction follows a nonconcerted route (path B).
It highlights the important role of the acidic proton at the C-4 position
of the quinoline ring and the condensed water in stabilization of
imine, allowing the α-isocyanide addition to generate nitrilium
intermediate 15. This later undergoes 5-exodig cyclization
to give precursor 16, followed by spontaneous 1,3-hydride
shift to give the GBBR product 17. To confirm this hypothesis,
we carried out DFT computational studies (see the Supporting Information for additional details). Figure 4 shows the energy profile for
the GBBR mechanism, taking water-stabilized imine intermediate 14 as a starting point. Axis “y”
shows the Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) in kcal·mol–1, and axis “x” shows
the reaction coordinate where we found TS14→15, which leads to the water-stabilized nitrilium intermediate 15. This reaction step has an energy barrier of 20.3 kcal·mol–1. The formation of nitrilium intermediate 15 is an endergonic process (17.4 kcal·mol–1) with respect to the imine intermediate 14. Then, following
the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC), we found TS15→16, which leads to the intermediate 16. This reaction step presents a little energy barrier of 3.6 kcal·mol–1. The formation of intermediate 16 is
an exergonic process (−3.7 kcal·mol–1) with respect to the imine intermediate 14. It is noteworthy
that stabilization due to the interaction of the water molecule along
the reaction coordinate is maintained in the intermediates 14 to 15 and their TS, which suggests an important role
to obtain low energy barriers.

Figure 4 Energy profile of the GBBR mechanism calculated
using DFT at the
M06-2X/6-311+G(d,p)//M06-2X/6-311G(d) level of theory.

After 1,3-H shift, the interaction with water is
broken by obtaining
the final product which is favored thermodynamically by −20.9
kcal·mol–1 with respect to the imine intermediate 14. Thus, a conclusion after analyzing this energy profile
is that the α-addition of isocyanide to the imine intermediate 14 is the slowest and determinant step throughout the GBBR
mechanism. Thus, 5-exo-dig cyclization of nitrilium 15 to intermediate 16 is the faster and spontaneous step
throughout the GBBR mechanism. Besides, as the barrier to form 16 from nitrilium 15 is not very large, it may
be difficult to observe this intermediate experimentally. Finally,
the reaction of TMSN3 with water (formed during imine condensation)
produces hydrazoic acid (HN3) and liberation of TMS-O-TMS.42

Next, HN3 protonates the nitrogen
of quinoline GBB product 17 to form iminium ion 18 which undergoes SNAr addition by the azide anion B to generate
intermediate 19. The subsequent elimination of chloride
ion in 19 takes place to generate precursor 20, in which the azide group undergoes ring-chain azido-tautomerization
to furnish the tetrazolo[1,5-a]quinoline σ-bound
with the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole framework 12a.

Antiamebic Activity
Amebiasis is a human intestinal
infection caused by Entamoeba histolytica characterized by bloody diarrhea, which often leads to death mainly
in tropical countries.46 In turn, protozoan
parasites have also become serious health problems worldwide because
of their ability to resist the current drugs. In this context, the
synthesis of novel compounds and evaluation for their pharmacological
properties will always worth to be investigated. Previously, we reported
the synthesis of chromone-tetrazoles32 and
fluorine-containing chromone-tetrazoles33 with in vitro activity against the parasite E. histolytica. The IC50 of these compounds was in the range of 57.1–67.3
μg/mL. In the present study, we evaluated the antiamebic effect
of two representative newly synthesized compounds 12f and 13g based on previous reports where similar compounds
shown good antibacterial activities.9,10 Compound 13g has no antiamebic activity at the maximum concentration
tested of 320 μg/mL;
meanwhile, compound 12f exhibits an IC50 =
140 μg/mL (Supporting Information). Although the IC50 against E. histolytica is
relatively high, the compound seems to be specific to the protozoa
because it has no antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus
aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. This specificity
could be important in order to not disturb the gut microbiota because
it is essential for human functions including digestion, energy metabolism,
and immune pathways of the host.47 Further
work is necessary to intensify the potency of 12f compound
by changing the structure of substituent groups in order to modify
its bioactivity against E. histolytica and on other pathogenic protozoa such as Trichomonas
vaginalis and Giardia lamblia.

Antibacterial Activity
Additionally, we screened compounds 12f and 13g against three bacterial species:
Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus ATCC
6538, Gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa ATCC 13384 and E. coli. Unfortunately,
the tested compounds were found to be inactive against the above-mentioned
bacterial species.

All synthesized compounds were characterized
by spectroscopic techniques such as 1H and 13C NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and IR.

Conclusions
The sonication-assisted one-pot green IMCR/post-transformation
strategy developed here under solvent- and catalyst-free is one contribution
toward the synthesis of bound-type fused bis-heterocycles (a) imidazole
analogues containing complex substituents at C-3 of imidazole and
(b) the fused 1,5-DsT with quinoline which have a fused imidazole
analogue at C-3. Additionally, this strategy has advantages as all
processes take place under mild and green conditions. This is the
first one-pot green GBBR strategy of bound-type fused bis-heterocycles
imidazole analogues under mild, sonication-assisted, solvent- and
catalyst-free conditions. USI reduced the reaction time and increased
the yields. This GBBR/post-transformation strategy allowed the construction
of two fused heterocycles with high complexity in one-pot under green
conditions in excellent yields. The generated endogenous water plays
dual role in the formation of two fused heterocycles, first stabilizing
imine and nitrilium intermediate to form fused imidazole and second
in the formation of fused tetrazole via in situ generating hydrazoic
acid. This is the first protocol in which the energy profile analysis
of the intermediates involved in the GBBR mechanism shows that the
acidic proton at the C-4 position of the quinoline ring and the endogenous
water played a central role in the stabilization of both imine and
nitrilium intermediates and favored the nonconcerted route (path B)
via the 5-exo-dig cyclization, which was not certain in our previous
report.34

The strategy herein reported
have advantages over the previously
reported one-pot MCR protocols toward fused tetrazolo[1,5-a]quinoline analogues that the tetrazole ring was created
in situ using mild, green, and neat conditions via endogenous water-triggered
formation of hydrazoic acid by single-proton exchange with TMSN3. The design and development of one-pot IMCR strategies coupled
with post-transformation are not only valuable as a powerful synthetic
tool to increase the complexity of the molecules which allows the
construction of polyheterocycles containing diverse privileged scaffolds
but also very important in the field of green chemistry under mild,
solvent- and catalyst-free conditions. In addition, we have demonstrated
that compound 12f is moderately antiamebic active against E. histolytica showing an IC50 = 140 μg/mL. Though the tested compounds failed to
show strong antibacterial and antiamebic activities, this study could
help to synthesize bioactive imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole
analogues using different substituents.

Antiamebic Assay
The virulent strain of E. histolytica (HM-1-IMSS) was grown axenically at
37 °C in the TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
bovine serum. Trophozoites at the exponential phase of growth were
used in all experiments. The antiamebic activity of the synthesized
imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole analogues 12f and 13g dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was
assessed using the standard dilution micromethod and subculture.33 Trophozoites (2 × 104) in 100
mL of TYI-S-33 were introduced in each well of the 96-well microtiter
plate (Nunc Thermo Scientific) and allow the parasites to adhere to
the bottom of the well at 37 °C for 2 h; then, 100 mL of different
concentrations (10–320 μg/mL) of each compound tested
in TYI-S-33 was added and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The trophozoites
were detached by chilling at 4 °C for 10 min and transferred
to new culture tubes with fresh medium without antibiotic and incubated
for 48 h at 37 °C. The final number of parasites was determined
with a hemocytometer, and the percentages of growth inhibition were
calculated by comparison with the control culture. Each test included
metronidazole (U.S.P. Poulenc, Lt. Montreal) as a standard amebicidal
drug and a control containing DMSO. The concentration of DMSO did
not exceed 1.5% in all assays performed. Each assay was performed
in triplicated and repeated two times.

Antibacterial Assay
The antibacterial activity of the
synthesized compounds was assessed by employing a standard dilution
method. The assay was carried out with several bacterial species,
the Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus ATCC 6538, and the Gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa ATCC 13384 and E. coli O55. The inoculum
was an overnight culture of each bacterial species in the LB broth
diluted in the same media to a final concentration of 100 CFU/mL.
The new synthesized compounds were dissolved in DMSO to a concentration
of 20 mg/mL. Further dilutions were performed in the LB broth containing
each bacteria species to reach a final concentration range of 10–320
μg/mL. The bacterial
growth was detected
by optical density determination at 600 nm (Spectrophotometer GeneQuant-pro
Amersham). The antibiotic cefotaxime (Sigma) was used as control bactericidal
tests of the reference strains.
