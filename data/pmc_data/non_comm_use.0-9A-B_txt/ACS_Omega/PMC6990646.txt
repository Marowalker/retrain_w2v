A series of novel
substituted 2-pyrimidylbenzothiazoles incorporating
either sulfonamide moieties or the amino group at C2 of the pyrimidine
ring were synthesized and evaluated for its antiviral potency. The
novel synthesis of the ring system was carried out by reacting guanidine
or N-arylsulfonated guanidine with different derivatives
of ylidene benzothiazole based on Michael addition pathways. The antiviral
activity of the newly synthesized compounds was examined by a plaque
reduction assay against HSV-1, CBV4, HAV HM 175, HCVcc genotype 4
viruses, and HAdV7. In the case of HSV-1, it was determined that 5
out of the 21 synthesized compounds exhibited superior viral reduction
in the range of 70–90% with significant IC50, CC50, and SI values as compared with acyclovir. In the case of
CBV4, nine compounds have shown more than 50% reduction. Comparable
results were obtained for seven of these synthesized compounds when
evaluated against HAV with only a couple of them showing 50% reduction
or more against HCVcc genotype 4. Remarkably, one compound, 9a, has shown broad action against all five examined viruses,
rendering it as potentially an effective antiviral agent. The five
potent compounds 9a, 9b, 14b, 14g, and 14h against HSV-1 have also
presented inhibitory activity against the Hsp90α protein with
IC50 in the range of 4.87–10.47 μg/mL. Interestingly,
a combination of the potent synthesized compounds with acyclovir led
to IC50 values lower than that of acyclovir alone. The
potent compounds 9a, 9b, 14b, 14g, and 14h were also docked inside the active site of
Hsp90α to assess the interaction pattern between the tested
compounds and the active site of the protein.

Introduction
Viral infections are
considered to be one of the major threats
to human health. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a member of
the Herpesviridae family, is considered to be the cause of a range
of diseases from mild uncomplicated mucocutaneous infections to more
serious infections such as cold sores and encephalitis.1 Acyclovir (ACV) is normally used in treating
infections caused by HSV-1.2 The most common
side effects caused by ACV are nausea, diarrhea, headache, and vomiting.
Coxsackievirus B4 (CBV4) virus, a member of the Picornavirus genus, has been involved in the development of insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus (IDDM) normally caused by virus-induced pancreatic
cell damage.3 Thus far, there is no specific
treatment or vaccine available for CBV4 infections. However, the only
available treatment is directed only toward relieving the symptoms
resulting from the viral infections.4 Hepatitis
A (HAV) virus normally causes inflammation and may affect the liver
functions5 but hardly results in serious
liver damage. Hepatitis C virus (HCV), however, causes chronic viral
infection and is recognized to be one of the leading causes of liver
impairment such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.6 Remarkably, sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) is used for
the treatment of HCV in combination with other medications such as
ribavirin, peginterferon-alfa, simeprevir, ledipasvir, daclatasvir,
or velpatasvir to reduce the amount of HCV in the effected body and
thus help the liver to recover.7 However,
sofosbuvir may cause some unwanted effects such as fatigue, headache,
nausea, and anemia. Infections caused by human adenovirus type 7 (HAdV7)
may include acute respiratory disease syndrome, pneumonia, pharyngoconjunctival
fever, and diseases of the central nervous system.8 Such as the case with CBV4, there is no direct treatment
against the viral infection.9 Therefore,
the development of novel drugs with superior activity against these
drug-resistant viruses will most certainly require extensive synthetic
research and clinical assessment.

Of interest here, it has been
shown on many occasions that pyrimidine,
benzothiazole, and sulfonamide structural units present within various
molecules have exhibited interesting antiviral activities. The pyrimidine
ring, for example, is the base unit of both ACV and Sovaldi, which
are used for the treatment of HSV-1 and HCV, respectively. Assessing
the antiviral potency of several published compounds, shown in Figure 1, has indicated their
promising activity against HSV-1.10 For
example, pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives A and B as well as both dimethoxyphenylpyrimidin-5(4H)-one C and thiazolopyrimidine D all showed good antiviral activities against HSV-1 compared to ACV.11 Moreover, pyrimido[2,1-b]benzothiazole
derivatives E and F showed antiviral activity
against HSV-1 with 61 and 50% reduction in the viral plaques, respectively.12 The piperidinyl amidrazone derivative G was shown to have diminished the quantity of HSV-1 viral
plaques by 62% as compared to the reference drug aphidicolin.13

Figure 1 Pyrimidine, benzothiazole, and sulfonamide compounds as
antiviral
agents.

Inasmuch, pyrimidine nucleoside
analogues, compounds H and I (Figure 1), exhibited antiviral activities
against CVB4 with an EC50 value of 9.0 μg/mL in addition
to compound J that showed an impressive EC50 of 1 μM and a selectivity
index of 141.14,15

The pyrimidine ring bearing
the benzothiazole moiety at the C5
position, compound K (Figure 1), was found to produce the optimal inhibition
for HCV replication with an EC50 value of 0.03 μM
in addition to a selectivity index greater than 550.16,17 Acyl sulfonamide L, thiazolone-based sulfonamides M, and 6-(indol-2-yl) pyridine-3-sulfonamide derivative N have all demonstrated remarkable inhibition against HCV.18−20 Some of the cycloalkylthiopheneimine derivatives bearing a benzothiazole
moiety were also synthesized and assessed for their antiviral activities
against ADV7. In this regard, compound O (Figure 1) exhibited high potent antiviral
activities with an EC50 value of 10.8 μg/mL, which
was better than the control compound ribavirin with an EC50 value of 27.8 μg/mL.21 This clearly
demonstrated that the structural units of pyrimidine, benzothiazole,
and sulfonamide present within the various molecules are a common
factor among the active compounds for combating different infectious
viruses.

Based on our experience in developing new synthetic
approaches
for the synthesis of novel benzothiazole, pyrimidine, and sulfonamide
compounds in high yield,22−33 novel compounds with potent antiviral activities are planned to
be further developed and assessed as potential antiviral drugs in
this work. To achieve the target compounds in high yield, the pronounced
reactivity of guanidine and its derivatives will also be utilized
for the development of competent strategies for the synthesis of a
novel benzothiazole pyrimidine sulfonamide ring system. This will
be done through the reaction of ylidenes of benzothiazoles with either
guanidine or sulfaguanidine derivatives. The study will be further
extended to evaluate the exceptional characteristics of these compounds
as antiviral agents.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
A series
of 2-pyrimidylbenzothiazole derivatives
were synthesized starting with the facile preparation of benzothiazol-2-yl-acetonitrile 1, which was allowed to react with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMF-DMA) 2 in ethyl alcohol at room temperature for 10 min to afford the 2-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-(dimethylamino)acrylonitrile 3 intermediate in high yield (Scheme 1).34 This intermediate was
allowed to react further with N-arylsulfonated guanidine 4a,b under basic conditions using potassium hydroxide, forming N-(4-amino-5-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl)arylsulfonamide 5a,b (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of N-(4-Amino-5-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl)arylsulfonamide 5a,b
Structures 5a,b were elucidated
on the basis of their
IR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectral analysis. The
IR spectra of compound 5a showed characteristic absorption
bands of the NH2 and NH groups in the vicinity of 3429
and 3278 cm–1, respectively. The 1H NMR
spectrum revealed a multiplet signal at δ 7.30–7.99 ppm
assigned to the aromatic protons, a broad band at δ 7.67 ppm
assigned to the protons of the NH2 group, and a characteristic
singlet signal at δ 8.32 ppm assigned to the CH proton. The 13C NMR showed 15 signals, which were attributed to the aromatic
carbons of both the benzothiazole ring and phenylsulfonyl group. The
reaction proceeded via Michael addition of the amino group of the N-arylsulfonated guanidine 4a,b to the double
bond of the enamine with elimination of NH(CH3)2 on the first instance followed by the intramolecular cyclization
through the addition of the amino group to the cyano group as to provide
the pyrimidine derivatives 5a,b.

In an attempt
to prepare the N-(8-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-methylimidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidine-5-yl)benzenesulfonamide
fused-ring structure through the reaction of compound 5a with 3-chloropentane-2,4-dione 6 catalyzed by sodium
hydrogen carbonate in refluxing ethanol, a different open structure
compound was obtained instead. The product was analyzed spectrally
and confirmed to be N-(5-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-4-(2-oxopropyl)amino)pyrimidin-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide 7 (Scheme 2). The singlet signal in the 1H NMR spectra at 4.94 ppm
assigned to the two protons of the CH2 group along with
the existence of the carbonyl signature at 1645 cm–1 in the IR data confirmed the structure of compound 7.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of N-(5-(Benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-4-(2-oxopropyl)amino)
and 4-(2-Aryl-2-oxoethyl)amino) pyrimidin-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide 7 and 9a–c
Coincidentally, N-(3-aryl-8-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidine-5-yl) benzenesulfonamide
was also not prepared by reacting 5a with 2-bromo-4-substituted
acetophenone 8a–c using similar conditions as
above. 1H NMR and IR data revealed that the products of
this reaction were N-(5-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-4-(2-aryl-2-oxoethyl)amino)pyrimidin-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide 9a–c (Scheme 2). The absence of the imidazole proton signal in the 1H NMR and the presence of the singlet signal in the range
of 5.61–5.63 ppm as well as a signal at 57.0 ppm in the 13C NMR assigned to the two protons of the CH2 group
in addition to a band at 1650 cm–1 of the carbonyl
group in the IR spectra were all consistent with the chemical structures 9a–c (Scheme 2).

To further the study, a new series of 5-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-6-arylpyrimidine-2,4-diamine 13a–c have also been synthesized by reacting 2-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)arylacrylonitrile 11c–e (prepared
by reacting arylaldehyde 10a–e with benzothiazol-2-yl-acetonitrile 1) with guanidine hydrochloride 12 in the presence
of potassium hydroxide in 1,4-dioxane under reflux conditions (Scheme 3). The structure
of the resulting compounds was confirmed by spectral and elemental
analysis. IR spectra of compound 13b, for example, showed
a band for the amino group in the vicinity of 3432 cm–1. In addition, the 1H NMR spectra showed a characteristic
signal for protons of the methyl group at δ 2.41 ppm and aromatic
protons at δ 7.07–7.65 ppm.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of 5-(Benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-6-arylpyrimidine-2,4-diamine 13a–c
Replacement of guanidine hydrochloride
in the previous reaction
with N-arylsulfonated guanidine 4a,b under the same conditions afforded the N-(4-amino-5-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-6-(4-alkylbenzene)pyrimidin-2-yl)arylsulfonamide 14a–j (Scheme 4). Spectral data of compounds 14a–j were
consistent with their proposed structures. The 1H NMR spectrum
of 14e revealed a singlet band at δ 3.78 ppm assigned
to the protons of the OCH3 group, a multiplet at δ
6.96–8.10 ppm assigned to the aromatic protons, a broad band
at δ 8.59 ppm assigned to the protons of the NH2 group,
and a broad band at δ 11.93 ppm characteristic of the NH proton.
Additionally, 13C NMR showed a signal at δ 55.7 ppm,
which was attributed to the OCH3 carbon.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of N-(4-Amino-5-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-6-(4-substituted
benzene)pyrimidin-2-yl)arylsulfonamide 14a–j
Finally, benzothiazol-2-yl-acetonitrile 1 was reacted
with carbon disulfide in the presence of sodium ethoxide for 20 min,
which afforded the disodium salt that was further reacted with methyl
iodide at room temperature to yield 2-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3,3-bis(methylthio)acrylonitrile 16. The latter was reacted with the N-arylsulfonated
guanidine 4a,b to afford N-(4-amino-5-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-6-(methylthio)pyrimidin-2-yl)arylsulfonamide 17a,b(35) (Scheme 5). Spectral data of compound 17b were consistent with the proposed structure. IR spectra of the latter
showed characteristic absorption bands of the NH2 and NH
groups at wavenumbers 3375 and 3214 cm–1, respectively.
The 1H NMR spectrum revealed two singlet signals at δ
2.37 and 2.39 ppm for the protons of CH3 and SCH3 groups, respectively, a multiplet at δ 7.41–8.12 ppm
for the aromatic protons, a broad band at δ 8.49 ppm for the
protons of the NH2 group, and a broad band at δ 11.50
ppm characteristic of the NH proton.

Biological Evaluation
Antiviral
Activity
The antiviral activities of the
newly synthesized 2-pyrimidylbenzothiazoles were evaluated in vitro
against a wide variety of viruses such as HSV-1, CBV4, HAV HM 175,
ED-43/SG-Feo (VYG) replicon of HCV genotype 4a, and HAdV7. As it is
well known that there is no specific cure available for CBV4, HCVgenotype4
and HAdV7 viruses and that available commercial remedies are only
used to treat the symptoms but not the illness itself. For this particular
reason, acyclovir was used as a commercial standard for HSV-1 against
which our new compounds are compared. In order to study the antiviral
activities, the newly synthesized compounds were first subjected to
a cytotoxicity evaluation using cell lines FRHK-4, Hep2, BGM, Vero,
and Huh 7.5 as described clearly in the Supporting Information. No significant difference was observed between
the amounts of the nontoxic doses of the various synthesized compounds,
which ranged between 60 and 120 μg/mL. The synthesized compounds
showed an apparent effect on the infected viral cell lines having
different types of genome. The percentage of viral replication was
assessed by measuring the viral load in treated cells as compared
to the untreated cell line (Table 1).

The results
indicated that nine compounds, 5a, 5b, 9a, 9b, 9c, 14b, 14c, 14g, and 14h, had remarkable
antiviral effects that exceeded 50% reduction against
the studied viruses (Figure 2). Error bars in the figure represent the standard deviation
of the measured data. The 50% maximum cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) and the 50% maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) as well as the selectivity index (SI), CC50/IC50 ratio, were evaluated for the nine compounds that exhibited greater
than 50% viral reduction against the aforementioned tested viruses
(Tables 2–4 and Figures 3–7).

Five of the synthesized
compounds, 9a, 9b, 14b, 14g, and 14h, showed
a high level of potency against HSV-1 (Figure 2). While the viral reduction of ACV hit the
99.6% mark, compound 9a reached 90%, compound 14g reached 80%, and compounds 9b and 14h reached
70% (Figure 2). Furthermore,
as shown in Table 2, the five compounds also had IC50 values ranging from
0.05 to 0.074 μg/μL, while that of ACV was 0.007 μg/μL.
Although these compounds showed high performance against HSV-1when
compared to the standard drug, two compounds in particular, 9a and 14g, showed much better performance than
ACV in terms of its CC50. Compound 9a had
a CC50 value of 0.27 μg/μL, and compound 14g had a CC50 value of 0.24 μg/μL,
whereas ACV had a value of 0.028 μg/μL (Table 2). With respect to the SI factor,
compound 9a gave an SI value of 4.29, and compound 14g had an SI value of 4.8, whereas ACV had an SI value of
4. These selectivity indices and cytotoxicity results as well as the
viral reduction percentages indicate clearly the antiviral potency
of these newly synthesized compounds, 9a and 14g, especially when compared to the standard drug, ACV.

In the
case of coxsackievirus B4, nine compounds, 5a, 5b, 9a, 9b, 9c, 14b, 14c, 14g, and 14h, showed more than 50% viral reduction (Figure 2). The IC50 values
of these compounds ranged from 0.074 to 0.093 μg/μL with
CC50 values ranging from 0.23 to 0.17 μg/μL
(Table 3). Among these
nine compounds, compound 14c (CC50 = 0.23
μg/μL) showed the highest value for the cytotoxicity,
whereas compound 14h showed the lowest inhibition concentration
(IC50 = 0.074 μg/100 μL). Furthermore, compound 9a showed the highest SI value of 2.62.

Seven compounds,
namely, 5a, 9a, 9b, 14b, 14c, 14g,
and 14h, have shown more than 50% reduction against HAV
as clearly indicated in the supplementary tables with compound 9a exhibiting the highest level of inhibitory activity among
all others against HAV with 70% viral reduction. An IC50 value of 0.078 μg/μL, a CC50 value of 0.24
μg/μL, and an SI value of 3.08 were observed of 9a against the virus as indicated in Table 3. Although compounds 14g and 14h revealed the same average reduction around 60%, compound 14g showed higher CC50 than compound 14h.

Compound 9a showed apparent activity against
both
hepatitis C virus genotype 4a and adenovirus type 7, while compound 9b showed slightly higher activity against hepatitis C virus
genotype 4a (Figure 7). As shown in Table 4, both compounds 9a and 9b have the same
cytotoxicity concentrations (CC50 = 0.25 μg/μL)
but different inhibition concentrations (IC50) with values
of 0.12 and 0.086 μg/μL, respectively.

Structure–Activity
Relationships
Based on the
above results, the preliminary structure–activity relationships
(SAR) have been established. In the case of pyrimidine substituted
with phenylsulfonamide at C2, 5a, the compound exhibited
higher activity when compared to pyrimidine substituted with tosylamide
group, 5b (Figure 2). Additionally, the presence of a variety of amino arylethanone
groups on the pyrimidine ring, 9a–c, has increased
its antiviral activities when compared to that of the starting compound 5a (Figure 2). It is also clear that compound 9a with a bromide
substituent at the para position of the aryl moiety showed higher
activity against HSV-1, CBV4, HAV, and HAdV7 (Figure 8) than that of 9b with a chloride
substituent. However, replacement of the bromide substituent on the
aryl moiety with an electron-donating group such as a methyl group, 9c, has lowered its activity (Figure 2). Similar observations can be also made
in the case of compounds 14a–h. The presence of
electron-withdrawing groups such as a fluoride or chloride group on
the para position of the aryl group (position C6 of the pyrimidine
ring), 14b, 14c, 14g, and 14h, showed higher activities than those of compounds containing
electron-donating groups such as a methyl or methoxy group, 14d, 14e, 14i, and 14j. Compounds with the methylthio group at C6 of the pyrimidine ring 17a,b showed very low activities against all tested viruses.

Hsp90α Inhibition Assay
Heat shock protein 90
(Hsp90α) present in most cell types is important for viral protein
folding, assembly, and replication.36 During
infection, HSV-1, for example, uses the Hsp90α chaperone system,
and the viral polymerase could be a client protein of Hsp90α.37 The possibility that inhibitors of Hsp90α
would also be inhibitors of HSV-1 infection has led us to examine
our newly synthesized compounds as possible novel Hsp90α inhibitors.

In order to investigate the effect of the potent HSV-1 antiviral
compounds 9a, 9b, 14b, 14g, and 14h against Hsp90α, the Hsp90α
(C-Terminal) inhibitor screening assay kit was used. A combination
of each potent compound with ACV (reference drug), in a 1:1 ratio,
was also tested. Results for all compounds were calculated as IC50 and are displayed in Figure 3. The data obtained during this study were used to
graph a dose–response curve. The concentration of tested compounds
that is required to inhibit 50% of the virus cell population, IC50, was evaluated (Figure 4). Error bars in the various figures represent the
standard deviation of the measured data. By comparing the performance
of these compounds against that of the standard drug ACV, several
observations are noted. All five compounds exhibited a potent inhibitory
effect toward Hsp90α and were active in the microgram per milliliter
solution (Table 5).

Consistent with the calculated IC50, compound 14h was the most potent Hsp90α
inhibitor with an IC50 value of 4.87 μg/mL followed
by 9a and 14g with IC50 values
of 6.33 and 8.99 μg/mL,
respectively, as compared to the ACV reference drug IC50 value of 4.78 μg/mL. It is clear that the combination of four
out of the five tested compounds, namely, 9a, 9b, 14b, and 14g, with ACV has increased
the potency of the compounds, which was reflected as a marked reduction
in the IC50 values of the original single compounds. Notwithstanding,
these combinations have also shown lower IC50 values than
that of ACV itself. For example, the IC50 values of compounds 9a, 9b, 14b, and 14g have dropped from 6.33, 10.24, 10.47, and 8.99 μg/mL to 3.35,
3.41, 3.68, and 3.12 μg/mL, respectively, when combined with
ACV in a 1:1 ratio. The resulting data indicated that a combination
of compounds 9a, 9b, 14b, and 14g with ACV is highly recommended for use as possible potent
inhibitors for Hsp90α and, consequently, inhibitors for HSV-1.

Molecular Modeling and Docking Study
To evaluate the
underlying principles behind the action of these new compounds in
inhibiting Hsp90α, a molecular docking study using a molecular
modeling environment (MOE) was performed on the reference drug ACV
and the potent compounds 9a, 9b, 14b, 14g, and 14h. The compounds were docked
with the crystal structure of the Hsp90α protein (PDB ID 3b25) through the removal
of the bound ligand, B2K (4-methyl-6-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-pyrimidin-2-ylamine),
to uncover the binding pattern of these compounds with the receptor.
The docking study revealed that the molecules had good binding energy
in the range of −5.6421 to −9.7282 kcal/mol with the
receptor within the active site. The pyrimidine ring of ACV and the
tested compounds 9b, 14b, 14g, and 14h showed hydrophobic interaction with the active
site of Phe 138 (Figures 5–10). Only one
compound, 9a, displayed one hydrogen-bonding interaction
at a distance of 3.84 Å between the sulfur atom of the benzothiazole
ring and amino acid residue Asp 102 (Figure 6). Moreover, compounds 9a and 9b interacted with the amino acid residues Met 98 and Tyr
139, respectively, through polar bonds (Figures 6 and 7). In addition,
two aren-H interactions of the benzene ring and the amino group of
compounds 14b and 14h were observed to bind
to Leu 107 and Trp162, respectively (Figures 8 and 10), while compounds 9b and 14g showed one aren-H interaction with
Asn 51 and Thr 184, respectively (Figures 7 and 9). The docking
study revealed a docking score of −9.1024 kcal/mol for compound 14h, −8.6521 kcal/mol for compound 9a,
and a docking score of −5.6421 kcal/mol for the reference drug
ACV.

Conclusions
In conclusion, 21 new
compounds of 2-pyrimidylbenzothiazoles bearing
either the amino group or sulfonamide moieties at the C2 position
of the pyrimidine ring were synthesized by reacting guanidine or N-arylsulfonated guanidine with different derivatives of
ylidene benzothiazole. The structures of all the compounds were confirmed
spectroscopically and via elemental analyses. The newly synthesized
compounds were evaluated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1,
COB4, HAV HM 175, ED-43/SG-Feo (VYG) replicon of HCV genotype 4a,
and HAdV7. Nine compounds exhibited remarkable activities against
these viruses with high cytotoxicity concentration and more than 50%
viral reduction. The most active five compounds against HSV-1 have
been also evaluated against Hsp90α with their activities compared
to that of the reference drug acyclovir. A combination of the tested
compounds and acyclovir in a 1:1 ratio, amazingly, led to increased
potency for these compounds with IC50 values lower than
that of acyclovir. The work confirms that the newly synthesized novel
compounds, 2-pyrimidylbenzothiazole derivatives, exhibit exceptional
antiviral activities and inhibitory effect on the Hsp90α protein
and thus can be useful as highly effective broad spectrum antiviral
agents.

Biological Evaluation
Cytotoxicity Test
Cytotoxicity and
antiviral tests
were carried out at The National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt. Cytotoxicity
was done according to the literature.39−41 To prepare for the tests,
50 mg of each sample was allowed to dissolve in 1 mL of DMSO. To avoid
possible contamination of the samples, 24 μL of 100× of
an antibiotic–antimycotic mixture was added to 1 mL of each
sample. Next, 100 μL of each sample was subjected to bi-fold
dilutions followed by inoculating 100 μL of each dilution in
Hep-2, Vero, BGM, FRHK4, and Huh 7.5 cell lines previously cultured
in 96-multiwell plates to determine the nontoxic dose of the examined
samples. The well plates were provided from Greiner Bio-One, Germany,
while the cell lines were obtained from the Holding Company for Biological
Products & Vaccines VACSERA, Egypt. To complete the cytotoxicity
assay, cell morphology evaluation using an inverted light microscope
and the cell viability test through the application of trypan blue
dye exclusion method was utilized.

Cell Morphology Evaluation
by Inverted Light Microscopy
As mentioned earlier, cultures
of the cell lines (2 × 105 cells/mL) were prepared.
The cultures were then incubated
at a temperature of 37 °C for 24 h in a humidified CO2 atmosphere with a 5% ratio (v/v). This is to allow for the cell
monolayers to be confluent. From each well separately, the medium
was then removed and subsequently replenished with 100 μL of
bi-fold dilutions, prepared in DMEM (GIBCO BRL), of the different
tested samples. One hundred microliters of DMEM was used as the cell
control without sample addition. All cell cultures were incubated
in a humidified 5% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere at a temperature
of 37 °C for 72 h. On a daily basis, the cell morphology was
assessed for any possible morphological alterations on a microscopic
scale such as cell rounding and shrinking, loss of confluence, and
cytoplasm granulation and vacuolization. The morphological changes
were thus scored.40

Cell Viability
Assay
Trypan blue dye exclusion method
was used in this assay.42 The aforementioned
cell cultures (2 × 105 cells/mL) were grown in 12-well
tissue culture plates. One hundred microliters of bi-fold dilutions
of the tested samples was applied after 24 h incubation for each well
as described previously. The medium was then removed after 72 h, which
is followed by trypsinizing the cells with an equal volume of 0.4%
(w/v) of the trypan blue dye aqueous solution. Viable cells were assessed
using a phase contrast microscope.

Determination of Coxsackievirus
B4, HAV HM175, Adenovirus 7,
and HSV-1 Titers Using Plaque Assay
One hundred microliters
of nontoxic dilutions was mixed with 100 μL of the different
doses of HSV-1, HAdV7, HAV HM175, and CBV4 (1 × 105, 1 × 106, and 1 × 107). Each mixture
was incubated for half an hour at a temperature of 37 °C. One
hundred microliters of 10-fold dilutions of the untreated and treated
adenovirus 7, HAV HM175, CBV4, and HSV-1 was inoculated separately
into Hep-2, FRHK4, BGM, and Vero cell lines in 12-multiwell plates,
respectively. The samples were incubated without constant rocking
as to allow for the adsorption for 1 h in a 5% CO2-water
vapor atmosphere at a temperature of 37 °C as to mimic the human
body temperature. To keep the cells from drying, the plates were occasionally
rocked. One milliliter of 2X DMEM media (Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium supplied from Gibco-BRL) in addition to another
1 mL of 1% agarose was added to each well after the adsorption is
complete. The plates were then incubated in a 5% CO2-water
vapor atmosphere at a temperature of 37 °C. Following the incubation,
the sample cells were stained with 0.4% crystal violet after fixation
with formalin, the number of plaques was counted, and the titers were
also calculated. The latter was expressed in terms of plaque-forming
units per milliliter (pfu/mL).43,44 CC50 and
IC50 were evaluated for the promising materials (viral
reduction 50% or more). CC50 referring to the 50% cytotoxic
concentration of the test extract is defined as the concentration
that reduces the OD492 of the treated uninfected cells to half the
OD492 of the untreated uninfected cells. IC50 refers to
the concentration at which the compound plaque reduction rate reaches
halfway between the baseline and the maximum. All data were taken
as the average of three measurements (triplicates).

Antiviral
Bioassay of Tested Compounds against ED-43/SG-Feo
(VYG) Replicon of HCV Genotype 4a
To carry out the antiviral
assay, a nontoxic dose of the tested compounds was used against ED-43/SG-Feo
(VYG) replicon of HCV genotype 4a. To quantify HCV RNA, qRT-PCR supplied
from Taqman probe kit (Qiagen) was used. This was done in algal extracts
treated with Huh 7.5-infected cells. According to the literature and
following the manufacturer’s instructions, a dose-dependent
decrease in subgenomic RNA copies was shown.45

Hsp90α (C-Terminal) Inhibitor Screening Assay
The Hsp90α (C-Terminal) inhibitor screening assay was used
to assess the inhibition of Hsp90α binding to its target protein
cyclophilin D (PPID). A solution of 3X Hsp90α assay buffer 2
was first diluted with water to 1x Hsp90α assay buffer 2. Four
microliters of the diluted Hspα protein (1.5 ng/μL) was
added to each well designated “Blank” and “Substrate
Control”. Two microliters of the same solution without an inhibitor
(inhibitor buffer) was added to wells assigned to “Positive
Control”, “Substrate Control”, and “Blank”.
To initiate the enzymatic reaction, 4 μL of diluted PPID was
added to each well designated “Substrate control”, “Positive
Control”, and “Test Inhibitor” and then incubated
at room temperature for 30 min. The total volume for each well was
10 μL. An amount of 10 μL of diluted glutathione (250-fold
with 1x detection buffer) was added to each well. Ten microliters
of diluted streptavidin-conjugated donor beads was also added to wells
in a 96-well plate. Alpha-counts were then read. The percentage inhibition
was calculated for the different concentrations tested against the
control, and the IC50 values against the HSPα protein
were calculated from the concentration–inhibition response
curve.

Molecular Modeling
Docking simulations
were performed
using the crystal structure of Hsp90α (PDB ID 3b25) in complex to 4-methyl-6-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-pyrimidin-2-ylamine
(B2K).46 The PDB file was retrieved from
the Protein Data Bank. The structure of chain A was processed using
the Structure Preparation application in an MOE (molecular operating
environment, 2014), and the ligand molecule was removed from the protein
active site. Subsequently, the Protonate 3D application of the MOE
was used to add the missing hydrogens and properly assign the ionization
states. The default procedure in the MOE Dock application was used
to find the favorable binding configurations of the studied ligands.
Initial placement poses generated by the Alpha Triangle matcher were
rescored and filtered using the London dG Scoring method to pick those
exhibiting maximal hydrophobic, ionic, and hydrogen-bond contacts
to the protein. This was followed by a refinement stage. The generated
poses were energy minimized using the MMFF94x force field. Finally,
the optimized poses were ranked using the GBVI/WSA DG free-energy
estimates. Docking poses were visually inspected, and interactions
with binding pocket residues were analyzed.47
