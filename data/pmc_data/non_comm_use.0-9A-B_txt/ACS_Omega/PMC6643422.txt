The development of efficient catalysts
with high activities and
durabilities for use in the dry reforming of methane (DRM) is desirable
but challenging. We report the development of a nanoporous nickel
composite (nanoporous Ni/Y2O3) via a facile
one-step dealloying technique, for use in the DRM. Focusing on the
low-temperature DRM, our composite possessed remarkable activity and
durability against coking compared with conventional particle-based
Ni catalysts. This was attributed to the aluminum oxides present on
the Ni surface, which suppress pore coarsening. In addition, the inert
bundled Y2O3 nanowires are suitable for use
as substrates for nanoporous Ni.

==== Body
Introduction
As the major components
of natural and greenhouse gases, methane
(CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are key to achieving
a more sustainable society. Accordingly, the dry reforming of methane
(DRM) into “syn gas”, which is represented by the transformation
CH4 + CO2 → 2H2 + 2CO, could
be a potential technological solution; however, this reaction requires
high temperatures (550–1000 °C), which results in significant
catalyst degradation due to material sintering and coke deposition.1−3 To date, many heterogeneous (typically Ni-based) catalysts have
been evaluated to determine their stabilities and performances and
the modification of interactions between Ni and oxide supports4−8 and/or the structural design of multicore–shell shaped species9−22 have been proposed. Overall, the enhancement of catalyst performances
is the key target, in particular, in the context of lowering reaction
temperatures.

Dealloying is an electrochemical process commonly
employed for
the leaching of less noble elements from precursor alloys to form
bicontinuous nanoporous materials.23,24 Recently,
nanoporous metals with excellent chemical and physical properties
have been prepared via dealloying, thereby leading to cross-interdisciplinary
research related to batteries, catalysis, sensing, and biotechnological
applications.25−30 However, nanopore coarsening at high temperatures can cause a degradation
in performance and the suppression of such coarsening is a challenging
issue. We herein report the preparation of nanoporous Ni composites
via the one-step dealloying of a NiYAl alloy and compare the DRM performances
and durabilities of these composites with those of conventional Ni
catalysts prepared via chemical routes. In particular, we focus on
the low-temperature DRM (450 °C) where carbon coking tends to
be significant for Ni catalysts and we wish to demonstrate that our
nanoporous Ni composites exhibit structural durability and resistance
to coking. We expect that the nanoporous Ni composites reported herein
will widen the application of nanoporous metals and inspire the design
of novel DRM catalysts.

Results and Discussion
As outlined
in Figure 1a, we initially
prepared the nanoporous Ni composite catalyst
from the dealloying of a precursor alloy by Al leaching using a 30
wt % solution of NaOH, whereas Ni does not dissolve in the strongly
alkalic solution. In addition, we compared the performances of products
obtained from two precursors, namely, Al4NiY and Al2NiY intermetallics, with Al4NiY being the more
desirable of the two, as discussed later. It should be noted here
that the nanoporous Ni/Y2O3 refers to the dealloyed
Ni12.5Y12.5Al75 (Al4NiY).
Thus, we selected the nanoporous Ni composites prepared from the Al4NiY precursor for extensive evaluation. Interestingly, this
one-step dealloying procedure employed NiYAl powders to yield bundled
urchinlike nanoporous Ni particles bearing yttrium hydroxide, Y(OH)3. Although the tangled urchinlike Y(OH)3 structure
was unexpectedly obtained, we do note that hexagonal yttrium hydroxide
nanowires have been previously prepared via hydrothermal routes.31 The driving force for growth was attributed
to the crystal structure of yttrium hydroxide, and the formation mechanism
was attributed to complex interactions between the OH– and Y3+ ions.32Figure 1b,c shows the low-magnification
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the prepared samples,
and the high-resolution image given in Figure 1d indicates that the nanoporous Ni regions
contain fine pores of ∼10–20 nm diameter. In addition,
X-ray analysis (Figure 1e) confirmed the uniform distribution of Ni and Al. Indeed, the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns showed that changes in the crystal structure
took place during dealloying, with conversion from the intermetallic
Al4NiY precursor to the fcc Ni and Y(OH)3 compounds
being followed by the conversion of Y(OH)3 to Y2O3 subsequent to the DRM reaction. This process is outlined
in Figure S1. From inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) analysis, the nominal elemental composition was determined
to be Ni20.8Y19.2Al3.5O56.5 (atom %). In addition, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area was calculated to be 8.3 m2/g. For comparison
with conventional catalysts, Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/Y2O3 composites were synthesized via a hydrothermal
method and the TEM images of these composites are shown in Figures S2 and S3. For the conventional catalysts,
Ni particle sizes were comparable to those of the nanoporous Ni/Y2O3 prepared herein, and to maximize the performance,
the volumes of the Ni and oxide components were similar.

the fine pores; (e) scanning TEM (STEM) image and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry (EDS) chemical maps of the selected area, showing
the distributions of Ni (red) and Al (green).

As shown in Table 1, Figures 2, and S4, the catalytic performances of
the prepared
composites were examined for the DRM over 100 h at 450 °C and
the results compared with those of conventional Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/Y2O3. The product obtained from
the Ni12.5Y12.5Al75 precursor gave
a slightly better performance than that obtained from Ni25Y25Al50, as shown in Table 1, and it was found by ICP analysis that the
dealloying of Al was incomplete for the Ni25Y25Al50 precursor (Table S1),
thereby suggesting that the Al-rich precursor (Ni12.5Y12.5Al75) preferentially forms the desired nanostructure
during the dealloying process. In the initial stages of the reaction,
Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/Y2O3 were
more active than our prepared samples but both caused significant
carbon coking and increased the reactor pressure due to stacking.
Indeed, to prevent breakdown of the reactor, it was necessary to terminate
the tests after ∼15 h. In contrast, the nanoporous Ni/Y2O3 composite (i.e., dealloyed Ni12.5Y12.5Al75) prepared herein maintained a moderately
high performance over 100 h and the reactor pressure remained relatively
constant, thereby indicating that carbon coking was suppressed. It
should be noted that an ideal equilibrium conversion of 59% was calculated33 for CH4 and CO2 at 450
°C, assuming that no side reactions take place, thereby indicating
that there is still scope for further improvement.

a Measurements were taken at 450 °C
after 6 h (from Figure 2).

Coking suppression in
the nanoporous Ni/Y2O3 composite was confirmed
by in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
experiments, as shown in Figure 3a,b. More specifically, H2 and CO were generated
at both 450 and 700 °C without any significant catalytic degradation
being observed and the absence of significant signals indicated that
little carbon coking took place. However, in the case of the conventional
Ni/Al2O3, the presence of abundant absorbance
signals between 1000 and 4000 cm–1 was attributed
to carbon coking (note that the bands from the CO2 phase
at 2360 and 2340 cm–1 are overlapped) and these
signals increased in intensity with increasing reaction time. Furthermore,
the scanning electron microscopy images confirmed that graphitic carbon
nanotubes covered the surface following the FTIR experiments, as shown
in Figure S5.

The deposited carbon present following
the DRM process was also
evaluated by thermal gravimetric differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA)
under ambient conditions. The mass differences between the nanoporous
Ni/Y2O3 (i.e., dealloyed Ni12.5Y12.5Al75) and the conventional Ni/Al2O3 samples after the DRM are shown in Figure 4. For comparison, the data
from the as-prepared samples that were not subjected to the DRM are
also shown. The sharp mass loss above 500 °C corresponds to the
combustion of carbon,5,22 thereby indicating that carbon
coking is indeed suppressed for the nanoporous Ni/Y2O3.

Upon comparison of the heat durability with that of the bare
nanoporous
Ni dealloyed from a NiMn precursor at 650 °C (Figure S6) in our previous study34 and with that of other bare nanoporous metals, we found that the
prepared composite exhibited an excellent durability against heat.
To determine the origin of this improved durability, the microstructure
of the nanoporous Ni/Y2O3 composite (i.e., dealloyed
Ni12.5Y12.5Al75) was examined following
the DRM test at 650 °C for 3 h and the duration test at 450 °C
for 100 h (Figure 5a,b) and the region of interest in Figure 5b is probed on the nanoporous Ni area that
does not contain Y oxide substrate; hence, Y mapping is not shown/detected
here. Representative low-magnification images are also shown in Figure S7. In both cases, the nanostructured
Ni/Y2O3 with fine nanopores (i.e., ∼20–30
nm diameter) was retained. We also observed slight pore coarsening
during the DRM test, which corresponds to the decay taking place during
the DRM (Figure 2).
Interestingly, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping
clearly indicated that oxides of aluminum were formed on the nanoporous
Ni surface and that this suppressed pore coarsening. Indeed, as surface
diffusion is the dominant mechanism of pore coarsening, a novel solution
for suppressing such surface diffusion involves the formation of a
nanometer-thick layer of alumina by atomic layer deposition (ALD).35 In this study, the nanostructure transformed
into a more active and durable nanostructure without the requirement
for the expensive ALD process, as the solid-solute Al (Figure 1e) diffused to the surface
and underwent oxidation on the nanoporous Ni. The reaction-driven
transformation of porous nanostructures into active nanostructures
can also be found in other nanoporous metals36 and intermetallic compounds.37

the elemental distributions after the DRM tests of the nanoporous
Ni/Y2O3 composite (i.e., dealloyed Ni12.5Y12.5Al75): (a) 650 °C for 3 h and (b)
450 °C for 100 h.

We subsequently performed the in situ observation of nanoporous
Ni/Y2O3 under the DRM reaction atmosphere using
TEM with an environmental cell to gain further insight into the resistance
of this material to coking. The initial microstructure present prior
to the reaction is shown in Figure 6a. Upon increasing the temperature to 600 °C under
vacuum, no change in the microstructure was observed. In addition,
no carbon coking or pore coarsening was observed for the nanoporous
Ni regions following the introduction of a mixture of CH4 and CO2 (see Figure 6b), thereby indicating the improved coking resistance
of the nanoporous structure compared to that of the Ni particles.
In the case of conventional Ni particles, carbon deposition and nanotube
growth were catalytically triggered on the Ni surface38,39 during in situ TEM observations of the conventional Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (see Figure S8).
It therefore appears that the high structural stability of the aluminum
oxide-coated nanoporous Ni could be key to understanding the improved
coking resistance. In addition, although we presume the formation
of a complex mixture between the carbon layer and the Y2O3 surface during in situ observation of nanoporous Ni/Y2O3 under the DRM reaction atmosphere, as indicated
in Figures 6d,e and S9 showing the layer-by-layer motion and the
tubelike feature, the whole Y2O3 substrate was
stable, which was also confirmed in the practical DRM tests (Figure S7). The structurally robust nature of
the inert Y2O3 wire may also account for the
improved heat durability, thereby rendering this a suitable substrate
for nanoporous Ni.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully
developed a nanoporous Ni/Y2O3 catalyst for
use in the dry reforming of methane (DRM).
This nanoporous nickel composite was prepared via a one-step dealloying
process, and the aluminum oxide from the solid-solute Al present on
the nanoporous Ni surface was found to be key to understanding the
structural stability of the catalyst against heat and coking, due
to its role in preventing pore coarsening. We found that the inert
and urchinlike bundled Y2O3 was a suitable and
robust substrate for nanoporous Ni. As we expect that the production
of these nanoporous catalysts could easily be scaled up, they can
be considered a potential alternative to traditional Ni particle catalysts
for application in the DRM and may inspire the design of novel DRM
catalysts.

Methods
Preparation of Nanoporous Metals
Nanoporous
Ni Composite
Ni12.5Y12.5Al75 and Ni25Y25Al50 (atom
%) ingots were prepared by melting pure Ni, Y, and Al (purity >99.9
atom %), using an Ar-protected arc melting furnace, where Ni12.5Y12.5Al75 was the optimal composition for dealloying.
The prepared ingots were ground using a mortar and pestle and then
sieved to obtain powdered samples with an average size of 20 μm.
The precursor powders were dealloyed in a 30 wt % NaOH (97% Wako,
Japan) solution for 4 h at 50 °C and then rinsed thoroughly with
water and dried under air.

Conventional Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/Y2O3 Composites
The Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/Y2O3 composites
were prepared by a
conventional impregnation method. More specifically, following the
dissolution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O
(0.8 g, Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol (20 mL), either Al2O3 (0.3 g, Sigma-Aldrich) or Y2O3 (0.3
g, Sigma-Aldrich) powder was added to the alcoholic solution. The
resulting mixture was stirred for 8 h, and then ethanol was removed
by evaporation at 353 K. The desired Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/Y2O3 catalysts were obtained following
calcination in a H2–Ar gas mixture (5 vol % H2) at 873 K over 4 h.

Microstructural Characterization
The microstructures
of the obtained catalysts were characterized by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, equipped with aberration correctors,
for the image- and probe-forming lens systems, CEOS GmbH) and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry (EDS, JED-2300T, JEOL). High-resolution TEM and
scanning TEM (STEM) observations were conducted at an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV, with the Cs correctors optimized for point-to-point
resolutions of 1.3 and 1.1 Å for TEM and STEM, respectively.
The samples were transferred onto a Cu grid without the use of a uniform
carbon support film. X-ray diffraction profiles were obtained using
a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation.

For in situ TEM analyses, a 1000 kV JEM-1000K RS TEM (JEOL) equipped
with an environmental cell designed at Nagoya University (Japan) was employed,
along with a point-to-point resolution of 1.5 Å. All samples
were observed in a CH4 + CO2 gas mixture (50:50,
vol %) at 600 °C over a wide range of total pressures (1–30
Pa). The current flux was measured as 0.23 A cm–2 using a Faraday gauge.

Inductively coupled plasma analysis
was performed using an IRIS
Advantage DUO instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The deposited
carbon present after the DRM process was evaluated
by using thermal gravimetric differential thermal analyzer (TG-DTA,
NETZCH, STA 2500) under air. The sharp mass loss above 500 °C
corresponded to the combustion of carbon.

Catalytic Experiments
The desired sample (100 mg) was
loaded into a 4 mm quartz tube and tested using a continuous-flow
fixed-bed microreactor under atmospheric pressure. The quantities
of CH4, CO, H2, and CO2 were monitored
and evaluated using an on-line gas analyzer (BELMass, MicrotracBEL)
and a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with thermal
conductivity detectors. The reactant gas containing 1 vol % CH4, 1 vol % CO2, and Ar for balance was introduced
into the reactor at a space velocity of 100 cm3 min–1 (W/F = 0.06 g s cm–3). The calculation
details for the DRM performance are as follows              where [...]in and [...]out represent
the gas concentrations in the feed gas and effluent gas,
respectively.

FTIR spectra of the catalyst surfaces were measured
at the operating temperature using a JASCO 6100 FTIR system equipped
with a heat chamber (ST-Japan). Each sample (5 mg) was loaded onto
the sample stage, and the reactant gas containing 1 vol % CH4, 1 vol % CO2, and Ar for balance was introduced into
the environmental cell at a rate of 10 cm3 min–1. The concentrations of the feed gas and generated gas components
were determined using micro gas chromatography (Inficon, 3000 Micro-GC).

Surface Area Measurements
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas of the samples were measured at 77 K using a BELSORP-MAX
II (MicrotracBEL Japan, Inc.). Each sample was heated at 80 °C
under vacuum for 24 h prior to measurement, and the mass of each sample
was measured using a balance.
