Giant magnetoelectric coupling is
a very rare phenomenon that has
gained much attention in the past few decades due to fundamental interest
as well as practical applications. Here, we have successfully achieved
giant magnetoelectric coupling in PbTi1–xVxO3 (x = 0–1) using a series of generalized gradient-corrected GGA
(generalized gradient approximation), including on-site Coulomb repulsion
(U)-corrected spin-polarized calculations based on
accurate density functional theory. Our total energy calculations
show that PbTi1–xVxO3 stabilizes in C-type antiferromagnetic
ground state for x > 0.123. With the substitution
of V into PbTiO3, the tetragonal distortion is highly enhanced
accompanied by a linear increase in polarization. In addition, our
band structure analysis shows that for lower x values,
the tendency to form two-dimensional magnetism of PbTi1–xVxO3 decreases.
The orbital magnetic polarization was calculated with self-consistent
field method by including orbital polarization correction in the calculation
as well as from the computed X-ray magnetic dichroism spectra. A nonmagnetic
metallic ground state is observed for the paraelectric phase for V
concentration (x) = 1 competing with a volume change
of 10% showing a large magnetovolume effect. Our orbital-projected
density of states as well as orbital ordering analysis suggest that
the orbital ordering plays a major role in the magnetic-to-nonmagnetic
transition when going from ferroelectric to paraelectric phase. The
calculated magnetic anisotropic energy shows that the direction [110]
is the easy axis of magnetization for x = 1 composition.
The partial polarization analysis shows that the Ti/V–O hybridization
majorly contributes to the total electrical polarization. The present
study adds a new series of compounds to the magnetoelectric family
with rarely existing giant coupling between electric- and magnetic-order
parameters. These results show that such kind of materials can be
used for novel practical applications where one can change the magnetic
properties drastically (magnetic to nonmagnetic, as shown here) with
external electric field and vice versa.

Introduction
The promising coupling
between electric- and magnetic-order parameters
and the potential to manipulate one by the application of the other
have attracted much attention in the past few decades. Interest in
the research on materials with such coupling has grown because of
their wide range of application in multifunctional devices.1−5 The ultimate goal of this research is to obtain single-phase multiferroics
with strong coupling between ferroelectric- and magnetic-order parameters
at room temperature. There has been a considerable recent interest
in developing lone pair-based magnetoelectrics because of their high
value of electrical polarization. Examples of such composites include
BiFeO3–LaFeO3,6 BiFeO3–SrTiO3,77 BiFeO3PbTiO3,88 BiFeO3–BiCoO3,9 LaFeO3–PbTiO3,1010 BiFeO3–BaTiO3,1111 BiCoO3–BaTiO3,12 etc. PbTiO3 (PTO) is a perovskite ferroelectric material with a Curie
temperature of 490 °C and a large tetragonal distortion with c/a = 1.0613 at room temperature. But it is nonmagnetic (NM) due to the absence
of d electrons. The Ti atom can be substituted with some magnetic
ions, as a result of which the new compound can be expected to produce
both magnetic and ferroelectric behaviors. PTO-based magnetoelectrics
could be much more interesting because of the existence of two types
of mechanisms for ferroelectricity, i.e., lone pair electrons from
Pb2+ and d0-ness from Ti4+. So, here
we examine the magnetoelectric properties of a PTO-based multiferroic
series, i.e., PbTi1–xVxO3 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.33,
0.50, 0.67, 0.75, 1), where the 6s electrons of Pb2+ and
the d0-ness of Ti4+ stabilize the ferroelectricity
and the V induces magnetism.

On the other hand, PbVO3 (PVO), which is a member of
this series (x = 1), has gained much interest in
the last few years as a strong candidate for multiferroic oxide due
to its large electric polarization. Although it is isostructural with
PTO, it shows large tetragonal distortion (c/a = 1.229). Isolated layers of corner-shared VO5 pyramids form a layer-type perovskite structure with a space group P4mm.14 PVO
has been proposed to have an antiferromagnetic ordering and a ferroelectric
polarization as large as 152 μC/cm2 due to the presence
of large structural distortions.14−18 To this point, however, the true magnetic structure
and the multifunctional nature of this material are controversial
to researchers. Shpanchenko et al.14 found
no long-range magnetic ordering with their neutron powder diffraction
measurements down to 1.5 K. Belik et al.16 proposed that PVO is a two-dimensional (2D) spin-half square-lattice
strongly frustrated antiferromagnet due to the antiferromagnetic interactions
of the next nearest neighbors. Using magnetic susceptibility and specific
heat measurements as well as band structure calculations, Tsirlin19 confirmed that the S = 1/2
square lattice of vanadium 4+ ions in PVO is strongly frustrated due
to the next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions and no
long-range magnetic ordering was found down to 1.8 K. Due to the presence
of defects or ferromagnetic (FM) impurities in the sample, it has
been very difficult to clarify the intrinsic magnetic property in
PVO. Oka et al.20 investigated the magnetic
properties of PVO by preparing a multidomain single crystal without
any magnetic impurity. The broad maximum centered around 180 K in
the temperature-dependent magnetization curve indicates the presence
of two-dimensional antiferromagnetism. Muon spin rotation measurement
displayed the presence of a long-range order below 43 K. The epitaxial
thin films of PVO have been grown21 using
pulsed laser deposition, which brings a step forward to synthesis
of multiferroic materials outside of high-temperature and high-pressure
techniques to realize devices with multifunctionalities. In another
study on PVO thin films by Kumar et al.,22 a transition from a ferroelectric-only state to a ferroelectric
and magnetic state was observed below 100–130 K using second-harmonic
generation and X-ray linear dichroism. Experimental electron energy
loss spectroscopy investigation on V–L edge shows that V in
the PVO thin films is in the V4+ state, resulting in a
d1 state.23

PVO was also
investigated computationally by different researchers.
First-principles calculations were made by Uratani et al.17 for PVO along with BiCoO3. They found
that the easy axes of spin are different: [110] in PVO and [001] in
BiCoO3 even though both have similar crystal structure.
A spin spiral structure was predicted by Solovyev24 to analyze the absence of long-range magnetic ordering
in PVO. Calculations along with experiments were performed by Parveen
et al.25 in 2012 to study the thermal properties
of PVO, and the results confirmed the observations made by Tsirlin
et al.19 Ming et al.26 made a comparative study of the structural, electronic,
magnetic, and phase-transition properties in which various exchange-correlation
(XC) functionals were used and found that PVO is a 2D C-type antiferromagnetic
(C-AF), where the d1 electron of the V4+ ion
occupies the dxy orbital. A ferroelectric-to-paraelectric
phase transition at 1.75 GPa was also noted. Zhou et al.27 revisited the structural transitions in PVO
using a series of X-ray diffraction measurements and first-principles
calculations. They found that the C-AF insulating and NM metallic
states are the ground states for tetragonal and cubic phases, respectively.
They have also noted a noncentrosymmetric tetragonal-to-centrosymmetric
cubic perovskite structural phase transition in the pressure range
of 2.7–6.4 GPa.

Milošević et al.28 performed
ab initio calculations to study the electronic structure and optical
properties of PVO (and BiCoO3). Using first-principles
density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Ming et al.29 showed a first-order tetragonal-to-cubic phase
transition with a volume collapse of 11.6% under a uniaxial pressure
of 1.2 GPa accompanied by a C-AF insulator to an NM metal. Kadiri
et al.30 studied the magnetic properties
of PVO using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations
and determined PVO as an S = 1/2 antiferromagnet
with a Néel temperature (TN) of
182 K. Recently, Oka et al.31 have examined
the cubic phase of PVO under high pressure on experimental and theoretical
bases. They determined the transition pressure to be 3 GPa and showed
that above this pressure, the semiconductor-to-metal transition associated
with the structural transition (tetragonal to cubic) occurs.

There are some reports about the transition-metal substitution
at the V site of PVO. Tsuchiya et al.32 synthesized PbFe0.5V0.5O3 under
high pressure and found the crystal structure as a tetragonal perovskite
with c/a = 1.18. The magnetic study
revealed that the compound is an antiferromagnet and the electrical
polarization is estimated to be as large as 88 μC/cm2. Arévalo et al.33 studied Ti and
Cr substitutions at V site in PVO. A tetragonal-to-cubic transition
was observed as the Cr substitution level reaches 0.4, whereas the
Ti substitution preserves the P4mm symmetry. The interesting result observed by Arévalo et al.33 was the temperature-induced phase transition
from tetragonal to cubic in PbTi0.8V0.2O3 at 730 K. But PVO decomposes to Pb2V2O7 at 570 K before reaching its transition temperature.15 In another V site, Ti-substituted PbMO3 system (where M stands for V site substituted with Ti), Ricci34 predicted multiferroicity in PbTi0.875V0.125O3 with a ferromagnetic–ferroelectric
ground state and an electrical polarization of 95 μC/cm2. Recently, Pan et al.35 have experimentally
studied the Pb(Ti,V)O3 system where the V substitution
level varies from 0.1 to 0.6. They have found that in the whole composition
range, the P4mm symmetry was preserved
and the tetragonality was abnormally improved (so the spontaneous
polarization) with the replacement of Ti with V. Interestingly, they
have also observed an intrinsic giant volume contraction of ∼3.7%
for Pb(Ti0.7V0.3)O3 during the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric
phase transition. These observed interesting findings in the substituted
systems motivated us for the present study.

In the present work,
we have shown that the V substitution in PTO
can induce magnetism, which can lead to multiferroicity in the substituted
system. Thus, our ultimate aim to design magnetoelectric materials
from nonmagnetic system is satisfied. The coupling between the electric-
and magnetic-order parameters is strong due to the presence of two
ferroelectric mechanisms (lone pair of Pb2+ as well as
d0-ness of Ti4+). The 2D magnetism arises in
PVO due to the dxy-type orbital ordering
in the ferroelectric ground state. On the other hand, the disorder
induced by the substitution may release the frustration in PVO, which
can lead to a long-range magnetic ordering. We hope the substitution
could reduce the tendency of the system to form a 2D arrangement of
V cations, which may lead to form three-dimensional (3D) magnetic
ordering.

Computational Details
All of the results presented
here are obtained from ab initio density
functional calculations using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package36 or full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave
(FP-LAPW) method (Wien2k). To obtain the ground-state structural parameters
for PbTi1–xVxO3, we have optimized the crystal structure by minimizing
the force and stress acting on the system. The generalized gradient
approximation (GGA)37 in the scheme of
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)38 is employed to treat the exchange-correlation as it gives better
equilibrium structural parameters than the local density approximation.
The ionic positions and the shape of the crystals were relaxed for
different unit cell volumes until the energy and force convergence
criteria were reached, i.e., 10–6 eV per cell and
1 meV/Å per atom, respectively. As the structural parameters
are very sensitive to electrical polarization, a very high plane-wave
cutoff energy of 850 eV39 was used. A 6
× 6 × 6 Monkhorst–Pack k-point40 mesh was used for ferroelectric PTO, and similar
density of k-points was used for all other calculations.
To find the ground-state magnetic ordering, we have considered nonmagnetic
(NM), ferromagnetic (FM), A-type antiferromagnetic, C-type antiferromagnetic
(C-AF), and G-type antiferromagnetic configurations.41 To account for the strong electron correlation associated
with V 3d electrons on the electronic structure, the GGA + U method was used with Ueff =
3 eV. The Born effective charges (BECs) were calculated by the Berry
phase method with a 8 × 8 × 8 k-point mesh
per f.u. using the modern theory of polarization.42,43 We have used periodic supercell approach to simulate the substituted
systems, i.e., for compositions with 33 and 50% V substitutions, 1
× 1 × 3 and 1 × 1 × 2 supercells were created,
respectively. Then, one Ti atom was replaced with V to mimic the experimental
conditions. The supercells are again doubled in each direction to
incorporate different magnetic orderings. Similar kind of methodology
was used to model other compositions.

The orbital moments at
the transition-metal sites were calculated
using the orbital polarization correction (SO + OP) method implemented
in Wien2k.44 In addition, we have simulated
X-ray circular magnetic dichroism (XMCD)45 spectra using Wien2k and estimated the site-selective spin and orbital
magnetic moments of V ions using the XMCD sum rules.46,47 For simulating XMCD, we have used full-potential linearized augmented
plane-wave (FP-LAPW) method based on density functional theory as
implemented in the Wien2k code. The generalized gradient approximation
within the PBE scheme was used as the exchange-correlation potential.
The muffin tin radii for Pb, V, and O were chosen as 1.66, 2.49, and
1.50 a.u., respectively. The Brillouin zone integration has been carried
out with 5000k-points. The energy convergence with a convergence criterion
of 10–5 was obtained. The spin–orbit coupling
is considered in the calculation. As the ferromagnetic state is a
metal, the plasma frequency was first calculated and included in the
XMCD calculation.

Results and Discussion
Structural Phase Stability
PVO is a C-type antiferromagnet
(see Figure 1) due
to the presence of a d electron with S = 1/2. In oxides, it can either occur in the middle of an octahedron
cage (CaVO3, SrVO3)48 or it can form a strong vanadyl bond with one O with a short bond
length (ca. 1.55–1.60 Å).49 PVO is reported to exhibit a tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition
under pressure, but no structural transition was observed from 0 K
to its decomposition temperature.16 Moreover,
the minimum (apical) V–O bond length in the VO5 pyramid
in tetragonal PVO is 1.68 Å. This relatively longer bond shows
a comparatively weaker vanadyl bond than usual. The average of the
four planar V–O bond lengths is 1.99 Å. In agreement with
these findings, the calculated Goldschmidt tolerance factor for PVO
also shows a value of 1.036, which usually indicates noncentrosymmetric
distortion.

Figure 1 C-type antiferromagnetic structure of PVO. Pb and V atoms are labeled
on the illustration as green (big) and blue (medium) spheres, respectively.
Oxygen atoms occur at the corners of the VO5 square pyramid
and are labeled as red (small) spheres. Two types of oxygen atoms
are present in PbVO3, one at apical (labeled as O1) and
the other at the planar (labeled as O2) position. The optimized atomic
positions are Pb [0, 0, 0], V [0.5, 0.5, 0.5708 (0.5677)], O1 [0,
0, 0.2128 (0.2087)], and O2 [0, 0, 0.6902 (0.6919)]. The values in
parentheses are from experimental measurements.16

Here, we have made structural
optimizations for both the ferroelectric
(P4mm) and paraelectric (Pm3̅m) phases of PbTi1–xVxO3 for x = 0, 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.67, 0.75, and 1 compositions.
The substitution of V for Ti in PTO does not affect the symmetry of
the crystal as it retains the tetragonal symmetry for the whole composition
range.35 With increasing V content (x), the lattice parameter c increases almost
linearly and a decreases gradually, as shown in Figure 2. This results in
an unusual enhancement in the tetragonality of the PbTi1–xVxO3. This
can be understood on the basis of ionic radii of Ti4+ and
V4+ ions. The coordination number of Ti4+ changes
from six to five with increasing concentration of vanadium. The ionic
radius of V4+ is 0.53 Å, whereas the ionic radii of
Ti4+ are 0.61 and 0.51 Å for sixfold and fivefold
coordinations, respectively.50 So, with
decrease in ionic radii, the lattice parameter a(b) decreases to accommodate the smaller cation. On the other
hand, with increase of V concentration, the chance of vanadyl bond
formation increases, which leads to an increase in the length of c axis. This is also the reason behind the increase in volume
with the increase of x. It may be noted that PTO-modified
ferroelectrics such as (1–x)PTO–xBi(Ni1/2Ti1/2)O351 and (1–x)PTO–xBi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O352 usually do not show high value of c/a ratio. But some of the PTO-based compounds, i.e.,
(1–x)PTO–xBiFeO3,53 BiInO3–PTO,54 and (1–x)PTO–xBi(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O355 show abnormally high tetragonality. In the present
study, the achieved maximum tetragonality (c/a) for a PTO-based compound, i.e., PbTi0.25V0.75O3, is 1.24. This value is larger than that
of some of the conventional perovskite ferroelectrics such as 0.5PTO–0.5BiFeO3 (c/a = 1.14), 0.85PTO–0.15BiInO3 (1.08), and 0.6PTO–0.4Bi(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 (c/a = 1.11). PTO-based
ferroelectric materials with large c/a possess interesting physical properties, such as high value of ferroelectric
polarization (PS), high Curie temperature
(TC), and enhanced negative thermal expansion
(NTE). In this study, we have shown that PTO-based material with large c/a value possesses strong magnetoelectric
coupling as well as giant magnetovolume effect.

Figure 2 Evolution of lattice
parameters in PbTi1–xVxO3 as a function of x. The rapidly increasing c and slowly
decreasing a result in unusual enhancement in c/a value. The inset shows the octahedral
environment changes into pyramidal one due to increase in tetragonal
distortion with increasing x.

The unit cell volume is sensitive to structural transition
in PbTi1–xVxO3, i.e., it contracts when a ferroelectric-to-paraelectric
transition takes place. For x = 0.25, the volume
contracts by 4.2% during the phase transition. Most interestingly,
the volume contraction increases with increase in V content. The volume
contraction value increases to 6.3% for x = 0.50
and 8.4% for x = 0.67. When x =
1, the volume contracts by a value as large as 10.4% at the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric
phase transition point. One of the main factors for volume contraction
in this series of compounds at the phase transition is the change
in bonding between Pb–O and Ti/V–O, which is discussed
below. PTO-based composites with a high value of volume contraction
during phase transition can give rise to interesting properties like
high NTE. Moreover, a temperature-induced phase transition is observed
experimentally for x ≤ 0.3.35 So, it can be said that for higher amount of Ti substitution
in PbVO3, TC can be measurable
without decomposition.

The cubic structure of PVO can be considered
as a special case
of ideal tetragonal perovskite with c/a = 1. The ferroelectric polarization is very sensitive to structural
parameters. So, to calculate the c/a ratio for various compositions accurately, we have calculated the
total energy as a function of c/a. We have performed this calculation with a 1 × 1 × 2 supercell,
which means we should get a minimum energy for c/a = 2 for a cubic system. Consistent with this, our E ∼ c/a graph (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) for
PVO (x = 0) shows a minimum energy for c/a = 2 for the paraelectric phase, whereas for the
ferroelectric phase, we get a noninteger c/a. To find the possible polarization path, we have calculated
the total energy as a function of Pb displacement with respect to
V/Ti–O polyhedra. Figure 3 helps us to find the easiest path of the ferroelectric
polarization and the role of Pb ions in the tetragonal distortion.
We have plotted the displacement of Pb ion with respect to VO5 pyramid along the [111] and [001] directions. The energy
versus displacement curves for both the directions have double-well
shapes. It can be seen that the lowest energy for the off-center displacements
is along the [001] direction. It shows that the ferroelectric properties
are greatly effected by the polarizability of Pb. The energy difference
between the two directions is very small (about 2 meV/f.u.) compared
to well-known multiferroic BiFeO3.39 So, in principle, the Curie temperature of PVO must be less than
that of BiFeO3. However, the TC for PVO has not been estimated yet, as it decomposes before reaching
to its paraelectric phase. But the TC of
PbTi0.9V0.1O3 was estimated to be
823 K by Pan et al.,35 and it showed an
increasing trend V concentration (measured TC’s for PbTi0.8V0.2O3 and PbTi0.7V0.3O3 are in between
823 and 873 K). Compositions with x > 0.3 decompose
before reaching their TC.

Figure 3 Total energy as a function
of displacement of Pb ion along the
[001] and [111] directions for the ferroelectric PVO. Structural relaxations
were considered through selective dynamics.

We have also performed nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations
to
find out the energetics of ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition
and to identify a minimum-energy path for the phase transition. To
calculate the minimum-energy path, we have considered the tetragonal
phase of PbVO3 as the initial structure and the cubic phase
as the tetragonal structure. Different intermediate images were created,
and the energies for all of the images were calculated considering
the volume as well as shape variation. The energies obtained are plotted
versus the images (here mentioned as reaction coordinates). The graph
given in Figure 4 results
from NEB calculations, which shows that the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric
transition involves an energy barrier of 127 meV, which is higher
than the difference between the ground-state total energies of these
two phases, i.e., ∼70 meV. It also shows the V–O coordinated
polyhedra. In the case of ferroelectric phase, the V–O polyhedron
is highly distorted and makes a pyramidal arrangement. The intermediate
images along the FE-to-PE transition path with higher energies than
the FE phase possess comparatively less distorted polyhedra. Finally,
the end product, i.e., the paraelectric phase, exhibits an undistorted
octahedron. The high energy barrier for the phase transition is consistent
with the high-temperature FE-to-PE phase transition.

Figure 4 Ferroelectric-to-paraelectric
transition path for PVO obtained
from nudged elastic band method. Both volume and shape variations
during the transition are considered. The insets show the V and O
coordination for the particular images marked by arrows. The atom
colors are the same as in Figure 1.

Chemical Bonding
The chemical bonding analysis in compounds
similar to PVO, i.e., BaTiO3 and PTO, shows that the ferroelectric
instability arises due to the hybridization interaction between Ti
3d and O 2p states.56 So, it is interesting
to analyze the chemical bonding between V/Ti and O in PbTi1–xVxO3 to reach
the depth of the origin of ferroelectricity. Experimental results
and theoretical analysis also show that a significant hybridization
is present between Pb and O.57 This also
contributes to the Born effective charges (BEC) and, consequently,
to polarization.

The charge density plot for x = 0, 0.50, and 1 compositions is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen from Figure 5a–c that the charge density between
the B-site cation and apical oxygen increases as the V concentration
increases. In PVO, the presence of strong V–O1 bond along with
lone pair electrons at the Pb2+ site weakens the Pb–O1
bond. Because of these effects, the Pb atom shifts more toward O2
to maintain the charge balance. Hence, the covalent bonding interaction
between Pb and O2 shows an increasing trend, which is evident from Figure 5d–f as the
width of the charge density increases with increase in x. These observations indicate that the increase of V concentration
in PbTi1–xVxO3 not only increases the covalent bonding between
Ti/V and O1 but also that between Pb and O2. As a consequence, the
tetragonal distortion increases with increase in x.

Figure 5 Charge density between (a) Ti and O1 in PbTiO3, (b)
V and O1 in PbTi0.5V0.5O3, (c) V
and O1 bond in PbVO3, and (d) Pb and O2 in PbTiO3, (e) PbTi0.5V0.5O3, and (f) PbVO3.

The charge density plots for PVO
in cubic and tetragonal phases
are shown in Figure 6a (top and bottom, respectively). It can be seen that the charge
density distributions at the Pb and O sites are essentially isotropic
in nature for the paraelectric phase. On the other hand, a finite
amount of charge can be seen in between Pb and O in the tetragonal
phase showing the anisotropic nature of charge density distribution.
So, it can be stated that in cubic phase, the Pb–O bond has
more ionic character and the tetragonal phase has a mixed ionocovalent
bonding character. On the other hand, the bonding between V and O
is found to have substantial covalency in both the cubic and tetragonal
phases as we can find notable charge density between these atomic
sites. But it may be noted that the covalent interaction between V
and O in tetragonal phase is stronger than that in the cubic phase.
Due to this, the V atom is shifted from the center of the octahedron
stabilizing the ferroelectric state.

Figure 6 (a) Charge density, (b) charge transfer,
and (c) electron localization
function (ELF) for the paraelectric (top) and ferroelectric (bottom)
structures.

Charge transfer distribution
shows isotropic nature at the Pb and
O sites (Figure 6b)
in the cubic phase confirming the ionic bonding between Pb and O.
The anisotropic nature of charge transfer distribution between V and
O indicates the presence of finite covalent bonding between these
atoms in the cubic phase. The charge transfer distribution between
V and O as well as between Pb and O in tetragonal phase shows anisotropic
behavior, as shown in Figure 6b, indicating the presence of finite covalent bonding between
them. It may be noted that although the covalency between Pb and O
is weaker than that between V and O in the tetragonal phase, it has
equal importance in the structural and ferroelectric properties.

Electron localization function (ELF) also provides important information
about the bonding interaction between the constituents of a compound.
It can be seen from Figure 6c that the ELF is maximum at O sites and minimum at Pb and
V sites for both the paraelectric and ferroelectric phases. Finite
ELF can be seen in between V and O in the tetragonal phase showing
the presence of finite covalent bonding between them. The presence
of the stereochemically active lone pair electrons at Pb site is also
clearly visible in the ELF plot for the tetragonal case. So, the bonding
interaction between Pb and O as well as between V and O in the ferroelectric
tetragonal phase can be concluded as having dominant ionic character
with finite covalent bonding. The difference in the bonding behaviors
of Ti/V–O and Pb–O bonds for paraelectric and ferroelectric
phases plays a crucial role for the large volume contraction during
the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition. We have also plotted
the isosurface of the valence electron localization function with
an ELF value of 0.7, which is shown in Figure 7. This figure shows the lobe like lone pairs
of hybridized 6s electrons at the Pb site. The charge density and
charge transfer plots show that finite amount of electrons from Pb
sites covalently interact with O 2p ensuring that 6s electrons of
Pb are not completely chemically inert.

Figure 7 Valence electron localization
function isosurface plotted at a
value of 0.7 for PVO in the ferroelectric P4mm structure.

The site and orbital-projected densities of states (DOS)
for paraelectric
and ferroelectric phases for their respective ground-state magnetic
configurations are shown in Figure 8a,b, respectively. It can be seen that the V 3d states
and O 2p states are spread over in the valence band in a range of
−7 eV to Fermi level (EF). The
energetically degenerate nature of these two states indicates the
presence of strong covalent hybridization between V and O. This hybridization
weakens the short-range repulsion to lower the energy of the ferroelectric
phase. The filled O 2s states form narrow bands around −18
eV (see Figure 8b).
Above that, at around −9 eV, the Pb 6s lone pair electronic
states are present with small contributions from 2p electrons. This
also confirms that the 6s electrons are stereochemically active and
not inert. Although the Pb 6p states are well separated from its 6s states and are mostly present in conduction band (CB),
a small amount of Pb 6p states can be seen, which are degenerate with
O 2p states confirming the Pb–O covalency. The hybridization
between these states enhances the stability of the ferroelectric phase
by lowering the total energy of the system. The partial DOS for PbTi0.5V0.5O3 calculated with GGA + U (Ueff = 3 eV) is given as Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. A similar
kind of DOS distribution can be seen for Pb, V, and O atoms in PbTi0.5V0.5O3 also. The almost empty d states indicate the d0-ness of Ti4+. Due to the covalent interaction between Ti and O, the charges redistribute
among themselves for which we see very small yet notable DOS in Ti
valence band.

PVO for
the respective ground-state magnetic structures in the (a) paraelectric
and (b) ferroelectric phases. The Fermi level is set to zero.

The nature and strength of the
bonding can also be determined by
crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis where the negative
and positive COHP values indicate bonding and antibonding interactions,
respectively. We have calculated the COHP among the constituents of
PVO (Pb–O, Pb–O2, V–O1, V–O2, O1–O2)
as shown in Figure 9. It can be seen that all of the occupied states for Pb–O
and V–O interactions have bonding states for both paraelectric
and ferroelectric phases. The Pb–O2 interaction for both the
paraelectric and ferroelectric phases are almost the same. But the
interaction between Pb and O1 in the ferroelectric case has more bonding
states, which are due to the hybridization between O 2p and Pb 6s/6p
states. This indicates the presence of stronger covalency between
Pb and O1 in the case of the ferroelectric phase compared to the paraelectric
one, which is also consistent with our charge density and partial
DOS analyses. In the ferroelectric phase, the V–O1 bonding
interaction is stronger than V–O2 bonding interaction, which
is due to the off-center displacement of V atom toward the O1 atom.

and ferroelectric phases describing Pb–O, Pb–O2, V–O1,

atoms, respectively.

Electronic Structure
The total DOS given in Figure 10a for the paraelectric
phase shows a metallic behavior for all magnetic configurations. From
the total DOS of the ferroelectric phase (Figure 10b), it can be seen that the nonmagnetic
phase shows a metallic state, whereas the ferromagnetic case is a
half metal with a gap of ∼0.5 eV in the down-spin channel.
But when the antiferromagnetic ordering is introduced, the exchange
potential produced by the exchange interaction pushes the V 3d states
toward the lower-energy side, which results in an insulating state
with a narrow gap. So, a combination of spin polarization, magnetic
ordering, and crystal structure plays important roles in stabilizing
the ferroelectric phase of PVO. The broad band spreading from −7
to −2 eV is mainly due to the strong hybridization between
V 3d and O 2p electrons. The localized states at around −9
eV are generated from the hybridized Pb 6s lone pair electrons. After
including the correlation effect through the Hubbard U into the Hamiltonian matrix, the states get more localized to give
a larger band gap, and this localization of the d electrons produces
a larger magnetic moment.

Figure 10 Total density of states for PVO in the non-spin-polarized,
ferromagnetic,
A-, C-, and G-type antiferromagnetic configurations for (a) paraelectric
and (b) ferroelectric phases. The Fermi level is set to zero.

The total DOS for x = 0.33, 0.50, and 0.67 compositions
were calculated with the GGA + U method, as shown
in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information.
The band gap value decreases with increase in x.
As it is known that the bond lengths and lattice parameters have direct
impact on band gaps, the decreasing band gap may be attributed to
the increase in the average Ti/V–O bond length with x in Ti/V–O6 polyhedra. (The average Ti–O
bond length is 2.07 Å in PTO, whereas the V–O bond length
is 2.11 Å in the case of PVO.) The lattice parameter c also increases with x.

The band
structures for both the para- and ferroelectric phases
of x = 1 composition are shown in Figure 11. The k-path
considered in the band structure is shown in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information. The lowest bands seen around
9 eV below the EF are due to the Pb 6s
states. It is to be noted that these bands are broader in the paraelectric
phase, whereas in the ferroelectric phase, they are more localized
in a small energy range. This explains the effect of 6s lone pair
in stabilizing the ferroelectric state. A manifold of occupied O 2p
bands are spread over a range of −7 to −2 eV. A pair
of bands separated from O 2p bands are localized just below EF. These are having V 3d character with no dispersion
along Γ–Z direction and a very weak
dispersion along X–R as well
as M–A directions indicating
a 2D characteristic in the ab plane.18 Above these band features, a narrow gap with the value
of 0.2 eV is present in the ferroelectric phase. The conduction bands
located in the vicinity of CB edge are derived from V 3d states, but
the bands at higher energy (∼3 eV) have mainly Pb 6p character.
We have also calculated the band structure with the GGA + U method. The GGA + U band structures for x = 0.5 and 1 compositions are given in Figures S5 and S6 in the Supporting Information. It can be
seen that when the V concentration is low, the vanadyl bond weakens
and therefore the dxy band gets dispersed
along the Γ–Z, X–R, and M–A directions.
This indicates that the tendency of the system to form the 2D magnetism
is reduced for lower x values.

(right) ferroelectric phases. The Fermi level is set to zero.

Magnetic Properties
We have calculated total energies
for nonmagnetic and all of the magnetic orderings mentioned above
for PbTi1–xVxO3 in both paraelectric and ferroelectric phases,
as shown in Table S1 in the Supporting
Information. PTO is a well-known nonmagnetic compound. Our total energy
calculation reveals that the C-AF is the ground state for other compositions.
It is to be noted that the C-AF and G-AF states are almost degenerate
(see Table S1 in the Supporting Information).
The present observation of C-AF state as a magnetic ground state for
PVO is consistent with experimental observation of a two-dimensional
C-AF phase and also with other theoretical studies.14,17 To identify the exact composition where the nonmagnetic-to-magnetic
transition occurs, we have plotted ΔE versus x (where ΔE = EC-AF – ENM) for the
ferroelectric phase, as shown in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information. The energy difference increases linearly
as the concentration of V increases due to the increase in localized
d electrons density per cell making the antiferromagnetic state more
stable. We have extrapolated the ΔE versus x curve, and the magnetic transition point is found to be x ∼ 0.123. This is in agreement with previous theoretical
finding by Ricci et al.34 using similar
calculations that the magnetic ground state stabilizes in PbTi1–xVxO3 for x = 12.5%.

The total energy shows
a nonmagnetic ground state for the paraelectric phase of PbTi1–xVxO3. So, the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition is
associated with a magnetic-to-nonmagnetic transition, which shows
a strong coupling between the electric and magnetic-order parameters
for x > 0.123. Now, the large values of volume
contraction
during the structural transition can also be attributed to the associated
magnetic phase transition. So, it can be said that this series of
compounds possess not only giant magnetoelectric effect but also giant
magnetovolume effect. It is to be noted that compounds with strong
magnetovolume effect can be used to convert magnetic energy into kinetic
energy or vice versa and are used to build actuators and sensors.

The orbital-projected DOS for the V 3d electrons for both paraelectric
and ferroelectric phases in PVO are given in Figure 12a,b, respectively. In the presence of a
cubic octahedral crystal field, the d level of transition-metal cation
splits into t2g (with degenerate dxy, dxy, and dzx orbitals) and eg (with degenerate dx2–y2 and dz2) orbitals. The eg levels are completely empty, whereas the t2g states
are partially filled in the paraelectric phase resulting in a metallic
state. The ferroelectric phase of PVO has a square pyramidal coordination
(Figure 1) because
of the off-center displacement of V. Due to the presence of VO5 square pyramidal environment, the t2g level of
V 3d electrons splits into b2g (dxy) and doubly degenerate eg (dyz, dxz) levels with an energy difference
of ∼1 eV. Similarly, the degeneracy of eg level
breaks to produce separate b1g (dx2–y2) and a1g (dz2) levels.24 The orbital degeneracy is broken because of
the second-order Jahn–Teller ordering. This was also noted
in the YTiO3 with d1 configuration of Ti3+ similar to V4+ in our study.58 The orbital-projected DOS for the ferroelectric phase given
in Figure 12b shows
that the localized V 3d electrons are present in the lowest-lying
dxy orbital, which is separated from other d orbitals by crystal field splitting, making a spin 1/2
antiferromagnetic ordering in the ab plane. Due to
the localized nature of this d-electron, there is a strong intraatomic
exchange splitting that shifts the unoccupied dxy states to relatively higher energy.

Figure 12 Orbital-projected density
of states for the 3d electrons in the
V site of PbVO3 in the (a) paraelectric and (b) ferroelectric
phases for their respective ground-state magnetic structures. The
Fermi level is set to zero.

We know that the electrons present in the vicinity of Fermi
level
actively participate in electrical conduction and magnetic exchange
interactions. So we have used the integrated values of the orbital-projected
DOS, i.e., from EF to −1 eV, to
study the orbital ordering. We have used the same procedure for OO
study as given in our previous studies,59,60 and such analysis
provides not only the OO pattern but also a pictorial illustration
of the orientation of a particular d orbital. The OO patterns for
ferroelectric and paraelectric phases are shown in Figure 13. It can be seen that the
V atom has a dxy pattern OO in the ferroelectric
phase. This type of orbital ordering in PVO strengthens the intraplanar
V–O–V interactions and also stabilizes the 2D magnetism.
Hence, the magnetic and orbital ordering are ingeniously coupled with
the lattice distortion and ionic displacements that result in strong
magnetoelectric coupling. But in the cubic paraelectric case, the
V–O–V interactions are strong enough to create an itinerant-electron
band with all of the t2g orbitals partially filled. So,
the OO pattern for paraelectric phase does not show a particular manner
of ordering from any of the t2g orbitals. This weakens
the exchange coupling and stabilizes a nonmagnetic ground state.

Figure 13 Orbital
ordering pattern of PVO in (left) the ferroelectric and
(right) paraelectric phases as derived from full-potential calculations.

The calculated magnetic moment
at the V site is 0.93 μB for the ferroelectric phase.
The covalency present between
V and O induces a magnetic moment of 0.05 μB at the
O site. The orbital magnetic moment at the V site evaluated using
the SO + OP method is estimated to be −0.045 μB. This indicates that the orbital magnetic moment is aligned antiparallelly
with the spin magnetic moment. The magnitude of the orbital moment
of PVO is almost 5 times less than that of BiCoO3.61 This is due to the presence of relatively larger
spin moment and stronger spin–orbit coupling in BiCoO3.

We have calculated the magnetic anisotropy energy62,63 for x = 0.5 and 1 in their ground-state C-AF configurations.
For this, we have calculated the variation of total energy by changing
the direction of the magnetization with the force theorem for the
compositions x = 0.5 and 1. The calculated relative
magneto anisotropy energies for x = 0.5 with respect
to the easy axis are 0, 0.125, 0.070, and 0.048 meV/f.u. and 0.592,
1.630, 0, and 0.185 meV/f.u. for x = 1 in the [001],
[100], [110], and [111] directions, respectively. Therefore, the easy
axis for PbTi0.5V0.5O3 and PVO are
[001] and [110], respectively. The change in magnetic easy axis from x = 0.5 to 1 can be attributed to the formation of vanadyl
bond with increase in V concentration, i.e., the x = 0.5 composition is a BiCoO3 like C-AF (so it shows
similar easy axis), and with increase in V concentration, the tendency
to form a 2D antiferromagnetism increases (which also reflects in
our band structure).

To get deeper understanding of the magnetic
properties of PVO,
we have simulated the XMCD and X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) at the
L2,3 edges of V in the ferromagnetic configuration of PVO.
The XMCD and XAS spectra along with the left- and right-polarized
spectra for V atom in PVO are given in Figure 14. By applying the sum rules46,47 given in the Supporting Information,
we have evaluated the spin and orbital moments at the V site. The
obtained orbital moment of −0.039 μB for V
is consistent with that obtained directly from the self-consistent
calculations (−0.045 μB). The sum rule analysis
results in a spin moment of 0.8 μB/V for the V L2,3 edges. However, this varies notably from the value calculated
by the self-consistent field (SCF) method, which is ∼1 μB/V. Detailed analysis on different 3d compounds by Wende et
al.64 shows that the deviation of the sum
rule results from the SCF predictions is larger for lighter 3d elements65−67 as integral sum rule analysis ignores the spectral shape of the
XMCD. So, the detailed fine structure in the XMCD of V should be fitted
with the multipole moment analysis, as explained in ref (67).

the V L2,3 edges for right circular
and left circular polarization of the exciting X-rays, X-ray magnetic
circular dichroism, and X-ray absorption spectra in PVO.

Born Effective Charge and Spontaneous Polarization
We have calculated BECs for all of the compositions mentioned above.
The diagonal components of the BECs for x = 0, 0.5,
and 1.0 compositions are given in Table 1. The formal valences for Pb, V, Ti, and
O in PbTi1–xVxO3 are +2, +4, +4, and −2, respectively.
But the diagonal components of the calculated BEC tensors for the
atoms are much larger than their nominal ionic values. This reveals
that there is large dynamic contribution superimposed to the static
charge. This is due to the strong covalency effect, where a large
amount of nonrigid delocalized charge flows across this compound during
the ionic displacement. This results in additional charges with respect
to the nominal ionic values (anomalous contribution), which are obtained
at the atomic sites. A large BEC value at the oxygen site also suggests
that a large force can be generated by applying a small field which
can stabilize the polarized state. In an effort to shed light on the
polarization of PbTi1–xVxO3 and its origin, we have evaluated the
polarization of PbTi1–xVxO3 for x = 0–1.
PTO and PVO are well-studied ferroelectrics with polarization values
of 92 and 147 μC/cm2, respectively. The calculated
polarization values increase from 92 μC/cm2 for pure
PTO to 105, 110, 118, 130, 135, and 147 μC/cm2 for x = 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.75, and 1, respectively. This
is due to the increase in tetragonal distortion with x as discussed above. The polarization calculated with point charges
showed comparatively low values. The reduction in polarization values
using point charges indicates that the covalency effect plays an important
role in deciding the polarization of these materials.

The atom-decomposed spontaneous polarization is given
for x = 0, 0.5, and 1 compositions in Figure 15. The major contribution toward
the polarization
is coming from the displacement of the O atom from its centrosymmetric
position. It can be seen that the polarization contribution of Ti
toward higher x value decreases. In contrast, an
opposite trend is seen for V atom. This is because of the enhancement
of covalency between B-site cation and O with V substitution at Ti
site.

PbTi1–xVxO3 for x = 0 (top), 0.5 (middle),
and 1 (bottom).

Conclusions
PbTi1–xVxO3 possesses strong coupling between magnetic- and
electric-order parameters for V concentration > 12.3%. Lower substituted
compositions are nonmagnetic ferroelectrics. Also, from the other
side, the inclusion of Ti at the V site increases the chance of forming
a 3D arrangement of V cations rather than 2D. The strong covalency
between Ti/V and O and notable covalency between Pb and O bring the
noncentrosymmetric distortion and stabilize the ferroelectric ground
state. The ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition is accompanied
by a magnetic-to-nonmagnetic transition for x >
0.123.
There is a large volume contraction during the above transition, indicating
a strong lattice–ferroelectric coupling and strong magnetovolume
effect. The calculations show high values of spontaneous electrical
polarizations, which are mainly due to the displacement of the apical
oxygen in the BO6 octahedra in the paraelectric phase due
to strong Ti/V–O covalent interaction. Therefore, PbTi1–xVxO3 is aseries of multifunctional compounds having giant magnetoelectric
effect where one can change the magnetic properties drastically (even
from magnetic to nonmagnetic, as shown here) by applying electric
field and vice versa, strong magnetovolume effect, induce 2D magnetism
as well as orbital ordering by electric field, strong ferroelectric–lattice
coupling, etc. Also, recent experimental studies by Pan et al.35 show that for lower V concentration, this series
shows good NTE response, and also a temperature-induced tetragonal-to-cubic
transition occurs, which makes this series more interesting for the
researchers to investigate its magneto/electro/multicaloric properties.
With all of these properties coexisting in the series, PbTi1–xVxO3 can be
useful for many multifunctional device applications.
