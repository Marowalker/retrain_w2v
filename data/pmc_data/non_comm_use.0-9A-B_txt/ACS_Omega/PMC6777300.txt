Coating techniques are key factors
in determining coated film properties.
In the present study, nanocomposite coatings of poly(vinyl alcohol)
and a nanoclay, montmorillonite, were deposited layer-by-layer using
roll (doctor blade, DB) and dip coating techniques, in an effort to
compare the impact of these techniques on the crosslinking efficiency
and oxygen barrier of the coated films. The barrier properties at
different relative humidities were tested, and the extent of nanoclay
intercalation as well as the films’ morphology was investigated.
Barrier was further improved by crosslinking the coating with glyoxal
and glutaraldehyde. Both techniques gave similar results but with
a higher impact of relative humidity in roll coated films. Better
results were achieved by tailoring the composition of those coatings
to favor a higher density of hydrogen bonding in the coating.

1 Introduction
High
oxygen barrier materials are in increasing demand for food
packaging. Numerous food products have a shelf life that could be
shortened due to an inadequate gas barrier of the package. Several
technologies have been adopted to enhance the oxygen barrier. Silicon
oxide (SiOx) coating results in a transparent coated film
that is microwavable and has a low oxygen permeability as well as
good resistance to water vapor.1,2 Its weak adhesion to
plastic substrates and ease of cracking3,4 however limits
its use in packaging. To have more flexible films, multilayer polymer
films were adopted in packaging. This structure enables achieving
the required properties (mechanical, saleability, etc.) while maintaining
a desirable appearance. Their processing, however, is complicated,
and their potential recycling, cost, and final possible barrier are
limiting factors. Blends also have been extensively studied to produce
barrier materials with a possible recycling of used polymers. High
barrier polymers like ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) and poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA) are used as the dispersed phase to reduce the permeability
of the matrix. Such a structure is cheaper than a multilayered one
and reduces the sensitivity to moisture of some high-barrier polymers.
The main challenge of blending, though, is the compatibilization of
the phases, as most of the polymers are immiscible.

Adding fillers
to polymers has gained popularity as an affordable
way to reduce polymer permeability5 and
enhance its mechanical properties.6 It
is mainly used with solution casting and extrusion, but a high filler
loading cannot be reached, as the resulting agglomeration alters the
composite’s properties.

The high aspect ratio of clays,
such as montmorillonite (MMT) (more
than 1007), slows the diffusion of oxygen
molecules through the polymer by increasing their diffusing path,
known as tortuosity.

To improve this tortuosity, the filler’s
volume fraction
and its aspect ratio are usually the considered parameters.8,9

The filler’s orientation has also an important impact
on
tortuosity, as demonstrated by Bhardwaj’s permeability model,10 even though it is not usually considered for
the modeling of nanocomposite permeability. A vertically orientated
fillers, for example, would not improve the tortuosity in the film
as does a perfectly horizontally oriented one.

An important
factor to be considered when manufacturing nanocomposites
is the chosen technique, considering its impact on these fillers’
properties. Polymer/clay nanocomposites, for instance, are often prepared
by solution and melt intercalation. The main drawback is the clay
platelets agglomeration during the processing11 that limits the amount of clay that can be incorporated in the nanocomposites,
particularly in the melt state. This may result in an oxygen barrier
not high enough for many applications. For a better barrier and acceptable
film transparency, a good clay dispersion and intercalation must be
achieved.

In some packaging applications, there is an increasing
demand for
alternative high-barrier materials due to the growing awareness about
recyclability. Such materials could be obtained with nanocomposite
coatings, as they result in a thinner structure than melt processed
or cast nanocomposites films and an easier recyclability. These coatings
have also a better barrier owing to the important fraction of clay
that can be achieved. New techniques such as layer-by-layer (LbL)
have succeeded in depositing thin nanocomposite coatings with good
orientation,12 dispersion, and intercalation
of clay platelets. This methodconsists in the successive
deposition of thin layers (polymers and/or nanofiller) on a substrate
with numerous types of interlayer interactions to hold these layers
together (electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, etc.). Depending
on their composition, the thickness of these layers can reach hundreds
of nanometers. LbL coatings have a higher gas barrier than conventional
metal or mineral oxide coating techniques, as it enables a high clay
loading without aggregation.13

LbL
deposition could be achieved with various processes, such as
spin coating,14 spraying,15,16 and dipping,17,18 for which scaling up is still
a challenge. Another technique that can be applied to LbL thin
filmdeposition is a roll-to-roll process, such as blade coating (DB).
This technique, derived from screen-printing, enables the deposition
of thin films (hundreds of nanometers) quickly with low material consumption.19 For LbL nanocomposite coatings, the filler layer
can be deposited separately from the polymer and not as a mix, like
in the case of single-layer coatings. Due to such alternate deposition,
it is possible to have a coating with a considerable amount of filler.13

LbL technique is widely applied to water-soluble
polymers, which
have high sensitivity to moisture. To further improve the oxygen barrier
at high relative humidity, there is generally recourse to crosslinking.
Dialdehyde crosslinkers (glutaraldehyde (GA), glyoxal (Gly),
etc.) are among the most frequently used ones due to their high reactivity
and increasing efficiency in crosslinking water-soluble polymers coatings,
thus reducing their sensitivity to moisture.20,21 The focus of this work is on the impact of the chosen coating technique
on the oxygen barrier at high relative humidity, which, to our knowledge
has not been addressed before.

In this study, LbL coatings of
PVA and MMT were deposited on a
PET substrate through two techniques, blade and dip coating with the
aim of comparing their efficiency in improving the coating’s
oxygen barrier at high relative humidity. To reduce the sensitivity
to moisture, the nanocomposite coatings were crosslinked with
two dialdehydes, glyoxal, and glutaraldehyde. The effect of crosslinking
on their permeability was investigated, and the oxygen permeability
of those coatings as a function of the relative humidity was reported.
Coatings morphology was analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM)
and the intercalation of clay platelets was characterized by X-ray
diffraction (XRD).

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
PVA (Mw = 140 000–186 000
g/mol) was purchased
from Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, Missouri). Natural sodium montmorillonite
(MMT) platelets (Cloisite NA+), nanoclay, with a density
of 2.86 g/cm3, were supplied by BYK (Gonzales, Texas) and
used as received. Silicon plates, supplied by EL-Cat Inc. (Ridgefield
Park, New Jersey), and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films, supplied
by ProAmpac (Terrebonne, Qc, Canada), were used as substrates for
LbL deposition. Poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) (5% aqueous solution),
supplied by MICA Corporation (Shelton, CT), was used as a primer for
all of the samples. The crosslinkers glyoxal (Gly, 40% aqueous solution)
and glutaraldehyde (GA, 25% aqueous solution), were purchased from
Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, Missouri).

2.2 Preparation
of Thin Films
PVA solutions
and MMT suspensions were prepared with deionized (DI) water. PVA solutions
were heated at 80 °C for 2 h. A PEI solution (0.6% in DI water)
was used to deposit a primer layer whether blade coated or dip coated
for 20 min and rinsed with DI water.

2.2.1 Dip
Coating
The coating deposition
cycle is a repetition of dipping in PVA and MMT solutions, rinsing,
and drying steps, as illustrated in Figure 1a. To increase the coverage of the surface,
the dipping time was 5 min for the first bilayer and the rinsing time
was 1 min. For the next layers, the dipping and rinsing times were
reduced to 1 min and 30 s, respectively. To achieve chemical crosslinking,
films were dipped in the GA or Gly solution (5% aqueous solution)
after half of the bilayers had been deposited and then at the end,
once all the 15 bilayers had been deposited.

Figure 1 Steps of layer-by-layer
assembly deposition by (a) blade coating
and (b) dip coating and (c) surface morphology of the two coatings.

2.2.2 Roll
(Blade) Coating
PVA and MMT
layers were deposited alternately by spreading the solution using
the doctor blade (Harper Scientific (Charlotte, NC); Figure 1b). As for dipping, a crosslinker
layer was applied twice, once half of the bilayers had been deposited
and at the end, after the final bilayer.

2.3 Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(Philips X’pert) was used in the wide-angle mode (wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (WAXD)), in the range from 2 to 10° at a rate
of 0.02°/s to determine the MMT interlayer spacing d(001) according to Bragg’s law. The source is copper Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å).

Permeability to oxygen
was measured via a MOCON OXTRAN 2/21 (Minneapolis) at 25 °C,
0% relative humidity, and 1 atm pressure, in accordance with the ASTM
D-3985-81. For tests with an adjustable relative humidity (RH), a
MOCON OXTRAN 10× apparatus (Minneapolis) was used at 25 °C
and a RH up to 70%. Water vapor permeability (WVP) was determined
at 25 °C via a MOCON PERMATRAN-W model 101K for 100% RH. Water
contact angle was measured at room temperature, with distilled water
as the probe liquid with a Contact Angle Goniometer OCA20 from dataphysics.
The time chosen to calculate the contact angles by the software was
5 s after a drop touches the sample surface. Five readings were measured
for each sample and an average of these values was reported and used
for the results discussion. The thickness of the coatings was determined
with a Dektak 3030 profilometer using silicon plates as substrate.
Morphology and roughness of the surface of the coated layer were examined
using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Nanoscope V Dimension Icon/Fastscan
AFM, Bruker) operated in the tapping mode in air. All of the imaging
was acquired using Intermittent Peak Force tapping using 125 μm
TESPA-V2 Air probes with the tip radius of 8 nm. The average roughness
of the samples was determined by measuring the roughness at 6 different
points. The average roughness values are reported with the standard
deviations. The surface microstructure was examined by comparing the
phase images of different samples for 5 μm × 5 μm
scan windows.

3 Results and Discussion
Dip coating is a widely used technique for fundamental studies
of LbL, whereas blade coating mimics better the industrial coating
process and can be helpful in scaling up the LbL deposition process.
Blading technique is faster than dipping, taking approximately half
the time compared to dipping due to fewer steps. This technique is
also more cost-effective, as it requires less material for each layer.
The use of DB enables a better control on the deposited volume of
the material. These techniques result in coatings with different morphologies
and properties as discussed in the following sections.

3.1 Oxygen and Moisture Barrier
Oxygen
transmission rates (OTR) of PET films coated with LbL deposited assemblies
were measured at 23 °C and 0% RH. A 15-bilayer coating reduced
the neat PET permeability considerably (Table 1). This high barrier is due, on one hand,
to an important nanoclay loading13 (>50
wt %) in the LbL coatings, which enhances the tortuosity in the film.
On the other hand, the high density of hydroxyl groups in the PVA
structure coupled to their strong hydrogen bonding,22 whether intermolecular or with MMT, can be responsible
of a considerable reduction of the free volume in the coatings, thus
reducing the permeability.

Blade
coating results in a better surface homogeneity than dip
coating as illustrated in Figure 1c. The heterogeneous surface of dipped coatings is
due to the progressive coverage of the substrate with each dipping
step, commonly known as island growth.23 For the first dipping cycles, the substrate surface is partially
covered with “islands” of polymers. The homogeneity
of the layers as well as a complete coverage of the substrate is eventually
obtained with more dipping cycles. This difference in the surface
coverage explains the better oxygen barrier of blade-coated films
with a permeability almost one third that of dip-coated films at 0%
RH.

Neat PET (16 μm) has a higher permeability than conventional
barrier polymers like PVA (1.5 cm3·μm/(m2·day·atm)).24 Coating
with 15 PVA layers only reduced this permeability by 50% with dipping
and by 80% with blading (Table 1). Increasing the number of PVA layers (30 instead of 15)
further reduced the permeability by 90%, whereas adding MMT layers,
instead, in a 15-bilayer structure (15 PVA + 15 MMT) resulted in the
highest reduction, 99%, for both dip and blade coatings. To compare
the permeability of a PVA-MMT bilayer coating and a coating with layers
of mixed PVA and MMT, a mixture of PVA and MMT was prepared by dispersing
MMT in the PVA solution while keeping the same concentration as used
for bilayer coating. The permeability of the mix coating was 10 times
higher, which is mainly due to the poorer dispersion of MMT and a
low intercalation of PVA.

Varying the relative humidity changed
the barrier results for the
two techniques. By increasing the humidity, the film is in contact
with a considerable amount of water molecules that interact with free
hydroxyl groups at the surface. This interaction affects the permeability
by altering the free volume in the coating. On one hand, water molecules
may disrupt hydrogen bonding by breaking the existing bonds and establishing
hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups.20 This
implies that a higher density of free hydroxyl groups may increase
the permeability. On the other hand, the adsorption of water molecules
results in the swelling of the coating,15 allowing a higher diffusing area for oxygen. Such a swelling can
be limited by the presence of well-intercalated MMT platelets in the
coating with a strong interaction with the polymer.25 According to these two points, the better barrier of dipped
coating at higher humidity can be related to its lower amount of free
hydroxyl groups and its reduced swelling due to the higher amount
of MMT in the coating (Figure S1). WVP
results (Table 2) confirm
this conclusion, as the blade-coated film has a higher permeability
to the hydrophilic permeant, i.e., water vapor, implying a higher
water adsorption due to free functional groups.

3.2 Crosslinking
Crosslinking with Gly
and GA reduced the oxygen permeability by 4–5 times for dipping
and 2–6 for blading. The better barrier of the Gly crosslinked
film may be due to small Gly molecules (Figure 2), which enables a faster diffusion through
the multilayer structure.

Figure 2 Structure of crosslinkers, (a) glyoxal, (b)
glutaraldehyde, and
(c) potential reaction of a dialdehyde crosslinker with PVA.

The results are shown in Table 2. At high RH, crosslinking
with GA decreased the sensitivity
to moisture for both types of coatings. Crosslinking with Gly, however,
resulted in two distinct results, with a barrier improvement for the
dip-coated film and a sharp permeabiltiy increase for the blade-coated
film. Knowing that permeability in humid conditions depends on the
interaction with water, this sharp increase of permeability with Gly
could be explained by a higher amount of nonreacted Gly molecule in
the film due to the short drying time. The presence of these nonbonded
molecules in the coatings may disrupt the established hydrogen bonds.
The barrier improvement with crosslinking for the dip- and blade-coated
film crosslinked with GA is the result of the covalent bonding that
reduces the fraction of the available hydroxyl groups. The crosslinking
mechanism of PVA with dialdehydes has already been discussed in literature,26,27 and it is described as the establishment of covalent bonds at both
crosslinker ends by creating covalent acetal bridges between polymer
chains, thus densifiying the coating (thinner coatings with crosslinking; Table 2, Figure 2).

To validate this mechanism
for an LbL structure, FTIR spectra of
the crosslinked and no coatings deposited by dipping were compared
(Figure 3). The vibration
band of PVA corresponding to C–O stretching26,28 shifted from 1096 to 1046 cm–1, which may be due
to inter- and intramolecular H-bonding interactions as well as bonding
with MMT. The peak intensity increased with crosslinking, with a higher
intensity for the Gly crosslinked coating. This change in intensity
coupled to the permeability results confirm that the crosslinking
density is higher with Gly.

Figure 3 FTIR spectra of crosslinked and no PVA-MMT coatings.

The broad peak between 3000 and
3500 cm–1 corresponds
to the hydroxyl groups in the coating. With no acid used in the crosslinking
reaction; in this study, both reaction steps are reversible. According
to the FTIR spectra, there is a higher amount of hydroxyl group in
the Gly crosslinked coating compared to the noncrosslinked and GA
crosslinked coatings. As free functional groups of dialdehyde can
be hydroxyl or carbonyl, Gly has more free hydroxyl than GA which
is confirmed by the FTIR peak at 1700 cm–1 in the
GA spectrum, specific to carbonyl groups.

As for noncrosslinked
films, dip-coated films crosslinked with
Gly and GA have a better barrier to a hydrophilic permeant (Table 2), suggesting that
even after crosslinking, blade-coated films have a higher density of free
functional groups.

To gain information about the hydrophilicity
of those coatings,
water contact angle (CA) was determined. Dip-coated films had a higher
CA with water than  blade coated films (Figure 4). Blade coated film crosslinked
with Gly had the most hydrophilic character, which would explain the
sharp increase in its permeability. Since hydrophilicity depends on
the composition of the outermost layer,29 the CA is mainly affected by the free hydroxyl groups on the surface
that are able to establish hydrogen bonds with water. The higher hydrophilicity
of blade-coated films could be explained by a lower crosslinking density,
as it is limited by the drying time.

Figure 4 Water contact angle of Gly and GA crosslinked
blade and dip-coated
films.

The hydrophilicity of those coatings
correlates well with the permeability
results at 70% RH (Figure 5), as dip-coated films have a higher CA and a lower oxygen
permeability.

Figure 5 Water contact angle and oxygen permeability of the dip-
and blade-coated
films at 70% RH without and with GA and Gly crosslinking.

Crosslinked coatings with Gly have a similar roughness
(37.7 ±
5.4 compared to 39.6 ± 8 nm; Figure S2) even though noncrosslinked dipped coating showed a higher roughness
(40.4 ± 6 compared to 18.8 ± 5.6 nm for bladed coating).
Knowing that an incomplete exfoliation of clay and the overlapping
of its platelets30 may affect the coating
roughness, clay intercalation and orientation were investigated. The
MMT basal spacing of 1.14 nm (2θ peak at 7.73°) increased
considerably for both types of coatings (Figure 6). The WAXD patterns for the PVA-MMT bilayers
deposited by blade and dip coating show a better nanoclay intercalation
for the dip-coated films (29.79, 17.89 Å compared to 23.19, 12.92
Å for blading). Considering the affinity between PVA and MMT,
the wider interlayer spacing for platelets in dip-coated films may
be explained by the better diffusion of PVA between the MMT platelets.
The dipping method allows better mobility of PVA chains as well as
longer time for diffusion. With blading, however, the volume of the
deposited layers is imposed by the doctor blade, and its diffusion
is limited by the film’s drying.

Figure 6 Wide-angle X-ray diffraction
of PVA-MMT coatings deposited by blade
coating and dipping.

To compare clay platelets orientation, the Hermans orientation
function, fCN, for each type of coating
was determined (see the Supporting Information for calculation details). This function ranges from 1 to −1/2,
with 1 for an orientation parallel to the surface and −1/2
for a vertical platelet orientation. Both techniques resulted in a
good clay platelet orientation, with a slightly better orientation
for blade coating (a value of 0.7 for fCN compared to 0.675 for dipping) as some stress is applied when spreading
the solution of PVA or MMT on the substrate.

Clay orientation
varies considerably with the used process. Extrusion
blow molding, for instance, results in a better orientation of clay
than compression molding or casting.31 Compressed
molded samples of poly(propylene) and modified clay (Cloisite 20A)
have a fCN of around 0.32 when compatibilized
and 0.27 without compatibilization.32 Clay
orientation in blown films is considerably higher with a fCN that reaches 0.8 without compatibilization33 and can be tailored by the draw ratio (DR) (0.6
(DR = 1) to 0.749 (DR = 5)).34 Single-layer
nanocomposite coatings can also have a similar orientation to LbL
coatings. A PVA/Kaolin coating,35 deposited
by a bench coater, has an orientation value of 0.76. This coating
also has a similar permeability to the studied coatings (0.7 ±
0.3 cm3·μm/(m2·day·atm)
(50% RH)), which is due to its higher thickness (5.9 μm) and
crystallinity (40%), as LbL coatings usually lack crystallinity.

3.3 Effect of Concentration of Solutions on Permeability
Despite the barrier improvement, crosslinking is an additional
coating step that does not generally use environmentally friendly
materials. To decrease the moisture sensitivity of the noncrosslinked
coatings, their composition was tailored. To this end, two approaches
were separately considered: the amount of free hydroxyl groups is
altered by improving the hydrogen bonding in the coating, and the
volume fraction of MMT in the coating is increased. This can be achieved
by increasing the concentration of the polymer solution and the MMT
suspension. For the studied PVA-MMT nanocomposite coating, the concentrations
of the polymer solution and the clay suspension affected differently
the permeability results. At 0% RH, dipped and bladed coatings showed
similar trend of permeability for low PVA solution concentration,
as illustrated in Figure 7. Bladed coatings showed a slightly better barrier and reached
a plateau at 0.3 wt %, whereas the permeability decreased further
for dipped coating to reach the same permeability as the bladed coating
at 0.5 wt %. The same trend is observed at 70% RH, with a plateau
in the range of 0.3–0.5 wt % for bladed coatings but with a
better barrier for dipped coatings.

Figure 7 Permeability at (a) 0 and (b) 70% RH for
various PVA concentrations.

A higher PVA solution concentration (0.5 wt %) increased
the coating
thickness, from 0.964 μm (for a 0.1 wt % concentration) to 1.668
μm, while the percentage per weight of the MMT in the coating
was reduced by 4% (Table S1).

This
is due to the deposition of the higher amount of PVA, as confirmed
by FTIR (Figure S3), with a higher concentration
of hydroxyl groups (3300 cm–1) and C–O bonds
(1070 cm–1) in the coating. With the increase in
the density of hydroxyl groups, there are more inter- and intramolecular
hydrogen bondings in the coating, resulting in the shift of the hydroxyl
peaks from 3378 to 3359 cm–1.

Increasing the
MMT suspension concentration did not have the same
effect on permeability (Figure 8a,b). At high and low RH, the permeability of blade-coated
films increased remarkably, whereas the permeability of the dip-coated
films started to increase from 2 wt % MMT suspension concentration
for both RH humidities and did not reach high values as in blade-coated
films. Contrary to PVA, a high concentration of the MMT suspension
did not lead to an improvement of the oxygen barrier. This could be
due to platelet agglomeration, thus reducing the tortuosity in the
coatings. The high loading of MMT in the film may also hinder the
intermolecular hydrogen bonding of PVA, which explains the considerable
increase in permeability with the higher concentration of clay suspension
(Table S1).

Figure 8 Permeability variation
with the concentration of the MMT solution
for (a) 0% and (b) 70% RH.

As mentioned previously, the increase of permeability at
high RH
is due to the established hydrogen bonds between water and free hydroxyl
groups and the possible rupture of pre-existing hydrogen bonds. Reducing
this permeability was possible with higher concentration of PVA in
the film due to a denser intermolecular interaction that lowers the
number of available hydroxyl groups to interact with water. The barrier
order shifted with the RH for these two techniques. A plausible explanation
could be that at dry conditions, the deposited layers of PVA and clay
are stuck together thus preventing the permeation of oxygen. At high
relative humidity, however, the solubility of water molecule changes
the fraction of free volume in the film. Tailoring the concentration
of clay and polymer solutions could also shed light on the clay–polymer
interface in the coatings. As clay–PVA interaction is based
on hydrogen bonding, the more established bonds there are, the more
the whole structure is maintained and the less water can penetrate.
By increasing the PVA concentration, dip coating resulted in the lowest
permeability at 70% RH. This confirms that the lower sensitivity of
dipped coatings to humidity is due to the higher density of hydrogen
bonds.

4 Conclusions
In this
study, barrier properties of two types of coating were
investigated. Bilayers coatings of PVA and MMT were deposited by the
LbL technique on a PET substrate using blade and dip coatings. The
presence of free hydroxyl groups at the surface caused a high sensitivity
to moisture for both coatings. Crosslinking this LbL structure with
dialdehydes reduced the oxygen permeability at high relative humidity.
Although the permeability was reduced by up to six times, densifying
the coating by creating covalent bonds between PVA and the crosslinker
was not enough for a better barrier. Limiting free hydroxyl groups
interaction with water by increasing the hydrogen bonding in the coating
turned out to be a better alternative. By increasing the PVA concentration
in the coating, the oxygen permeability was 26 times lower for dip-coated
films and 19 for blade-coated ones. Increasing the volume fraction
of clay was also considered as an alternative. Different concentrations
of the MMT suspension were used, and the resulting permeability led
to the conclusion that MMT concentration had a limit above which clay
platelet agglomeration increases the permeability. Finally, our results
suggest that the coating technique has a significant impact on the
coating surface structure, the extent of interlayer interaction, the
clay properties and the permeability of the coatings.
