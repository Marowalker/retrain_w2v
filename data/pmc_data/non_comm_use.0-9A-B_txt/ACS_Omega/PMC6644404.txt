A novel application of [DTBNpP] Pd(crotyl)Cl
(DTBNpP = di-tert-butylneopentylphosphine) (P2), an air-stable,
commercially available palladium precatalyst that allows rapid access
to a monoligated state, has been identified for room-temperature,
copper-free Sonogashira couplings of challenging aryl bromides and
alkynes. The mild reaction conditions with TMP in dimethyl sulfoxide
afford up to 97% yields, excellent functional group tolerability,
and broad reaction compatibility with access to one-pot indole formation.

Introduction
The Sonogashira reaction,
catalyzing C(sp)-C(sp2) bond
formation, is a vital tool in academia and industry, for its ability
to increase conjugation and rigidity in natural product synthesis,
drug development, molecular electronics, nanoscale scaffolds, and
heterocyclic chemistry.1−4 Historically, the use of copper co-catalysts with palladium allowed
for mild reaction conditions due to transmetallation, as reported
by Sonogashira.5 However, undesirable homocoupling
of acetylenes, air sensitivity, moisture sensitivity, and difficulties
in pharmaceutical purification processes prompted the need for well-refined,
copper-free systems while broadening the scope for challenging substrates.
Classic addition of a ligand to an air-stable Pd-source (such as Pd(OAc)2 or Pd2(dba)3) may encounter disruption
from inadvertent ligand coordination, catalyst impurity, or delayed
catalyst generation due to in situ formation.6−10 Even with the variety of palladium sources and ligands
currently available, arguably the most popular conditions for Sonogashira
reactions are Pd(PPh3)4, a catalyst lacking
air stability, and Pd(PPh3)2Cl2.
These reactions frequently require high temperatures, copper salts,
or additional ligands that may be pyrophoric or noncommercial, limiting
feasibility.11 Among newly published protocols
some call for atypical solvents, additives, or catalysts, and many
requiring long reaction times and show few examples of pharmaceutically
relevant heteroaromatics.12−17 Although few attractive methods are available in the literature,18,19 it is still desirable to develop a more robust protocol broadly
applicable for complex substrates.

Recently developed preformed
palladacycles20 and palladium dimers21,22 allow for a defined ligand ratio
and exhibit greater catalytic rates than their individual counterparts,
exemplifying the utility of preformed palladium complexes for numerous
carbon–carbon couplings. Additionally, these palladium precatalysts
pose an improvement to traditional catalysts by exhibiting greater
stability and feasibility in reaction set up while still providing
the same active catalyst. Despite the coordinative potential of palladium,
monoligated adducts (L1Pd0) frequently produce
a more efficient catalyst and thus there is a desire for precatalysts
capable of producing monoligated palladium in situ.23−25 The proposed
mechanism for monoligated precatalysts begins by activation to the
LPd0 state, utilizing bulky, electron-rich ligands to stabilize
a reactive catalytic species that facilitates faster oxidative addition
and efficient catalytic cycle.26,27 One of the prominent
monoligated precatalyst backbones was introduced by Buchwald in 2007:
air-stable palladacycles that are readily activated by deprotonation
under mild reaction conditions to obtain the monoligated Pd0 complex via reductive elimination of the intramolecular amine–aryl
group.28−32 Another successful, commercially available precatalysts synthesized
in 2002 by Nolan and co-workers utilize an allyl-based palladium precatalyst
that incorporates the NHC-carbene ligand. This monoligated precatalyst
is air stable, room-temperature activated and capable of performing
efficient Suzuki, Buchwald, and other cross-couplings.33,34 In 2010, Shaughnessy35 and Colacot36 found success replacing the NHC-ligand on Pd(allyl)Cl
complexes with bulky phosphines or varying the π-allyl substituents
in Suzuki, α-arylation, and amination reactions. These base-promoted,
bench-stable precatalysts reductively eliminate a noninhibitory olefin
byproduct while creating an active palladium complex proficient in
a wide range of cross-coupling reactions, including Sonogashira.27,37−39

Results and Discussion
The Sonogashira
coupling has become a prominent intermediate step
and functional group addition for medicinal chemistry projects. A
quick survey of prominent medicinal chemistry journals finds 18 references
already this year and 75 in 2017 employing the alkyne coupling, yet,
Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, and palladium salts with copper-dominated catalyst conditions.
During our medicinal chemistry efforts in synthesizing novel inhibitors
of human lactate dehydrogenase, we required a reliable and facile
Sonogashira coupling condition for library synthesis. These classical
conditions were minimally successful with our diversely functionalized
substrates and risked catalyst poisoning by incorporating nitrogen
and sulfur containing aryl groups, especially when attempting scale-up
procedures. We sought an improved catalyst and optimized condition
applicable to a wide variety of functional groups for application
in our work as well other medicinal chemistry projects that experienced
limitations similar to those listed above. The initial catalyst search
was based off the work of Soheili et al.,40 who performed Sonogashira couplings at room temperature with allyl
palladium chloride and P(t-Bu)3, without
copper, and hypothesized the formation of a monoligated active L1Pd0 catalyst using these substrates. In view of
the success of Buchwald and allyl monoligated palladium catalysts
in numerous cross-coupling reactions,41 we envisioned that preformed Buchwald and allyl monoligated palladium
precatalysts with bulky, electron-rich phosphines, have the capability
to be a bench-stable, monoligated precatalyst for copper-free Sonogashira
couplings. These next generation catalysts would provide a powerful
synthetic solution by expanding the scope, increasing catalytic rates,
and eliminating the use of pyrophoric ligands. Herein, we report the
catalytic efficiencies of several Buchwald palladacycles and allyl
monoligated palladium catalysts (Figure 1) applied to the Sonogashira reaction.

Figure 1 Currently established
palladium precatalysts: P1–P4, P6–P15. Ligand for in
situ catalyst: L1. P5 was synthesized in
house.

Initial efforts were focused on
the screening of precatalysts P1–P14 using challenging coupling partners.
The 3,5-dimethoxyphenyl bromide (1), which does not give
any product under classical Sonogashira conditions40 (entry 1 in Table 1) due to hindered oxidative addition step, and an electron-deficient
heteroaromatic alkyne (2), a representative for difficult
heteroaromatic alkynes that are frequently employed in medicinal chemistry
and pharmaceutical development, were coupled with base DABCO in tetrahydrofuran
(THF), conditions similar to those used by Soheli et al. For comparison,
several difficult electron-rich substrates, such as p-bromophenol (entry 5m), p-bromoaniline
(entry 5n), or 3-bromothiophene (entry 5r), were coupled using our protocol. The π–allyl palladium-based
catalyst (P1), which incorporated P(t-Bu)3 and a crotyl ligand, successfully produced coupling
product 3, without copper, in moderate yield (52%, entry
2). In changing the phosphine ligand to DTBNpP (P2) and
XPhos (P4) with the same palladium precatalyst, the P2 catalyst revealed to be a more efficient catalyst with
a 75% yield (entries 3 and 5).42 However,
the activity diminished dramatically when P(t-Bu)3 was replaced with P(Cy)3 (P3, entry
4). Attempting to improve yields with the η3-1-t-Bu-indenyl ligand (P5) (investigated by Hazari
et al.)43 led to only 53% yield (entry
6). The original π–allyl palladium complex without a
bulky phosphine ligand, unsurprisingly showed no appreciable product
(entries 7 and 8). Switching to Buchwald type precatalysts, both the P8 and P9 catalysts that contain the P(t-Bu)3 ligand were able to produce the desired
product, but much less effectively than P2 (23–27%
yield, entries 9 and 10). However, P10 and P11 incorporating the DTBNpP ligand markedly increased the yields to
63 and 56%, respectively (entries 11 and 12). Furthermore, P12 and P13 catalysts with P(t-Bu)2(Me) and P(t-Bu)2(n-Bu) ligand,
respectively, almost completely diminished catalyst activity (entries
13 and 14), proving the specificity of the DTBNpP ligand for this
system. The catalyst P14, a precursor to L1Pd0 and successfully used in amination reactions,10 demonstrated negligible activity within these
conditions (entry 15). Additionally, a commercially available NHC
precatalyst, P15, with a cinnamyl and chloride ligand
similar to the phosphine-based allyl precatalysts, was tested for
comparison; however, it afforded no product (entry 16). After finding P2 as the most efficient precatalyst, we then compared its
reactivity with the catalyst formed in situ. The catalyst formed from
1:1 (Pd/P) ratio of P6/L1 exhibits a slightly
higher yield after 18 h compared to P2, but a lower yield
within the first hour, likely due to formation of the active catalyst
(entry 17). Exchanging the crotyl ligand for cinnamyl to form the
in situ catalyst exhibited no significant improvement and provided
comparable product formation over time (entry 18). The addition of L1 to P2 (1:1) significantly retarded P2 activity with almost no conversion observed during the first 3 h
(entry 19). However, the activity progressed gradually to produce
a similar yield as independent P2 after 18 h (Figure 2 and entry 17 vs
entry 3). This could be due to the initial formation of the coordinately
saturated 14-electron L2Pd0. The remainder of
catalysts in Figure 2 tapered off their rate of product formation after 6 h, except for P10, which exhibited an increase in activity after 3 h possibly
due to delayed release of the aromatic amine. A comparison of the
DTBNpP-containing catalysts in Figure 2 demonstrates the efficiency of P2 compared
to its individual ligand/palladium sources and over the Buchwald precatalysts
for the Sonogashira reaction.

containing the DTBNpP ligand.

With the finding
of efficient catalyst P2, the effects
of base and solvent were next examined (Table 2). By using DABCO as the base, the reaction
achieved less than 50% yield with nonpolar (e.g., DCM and MTBE) or
polar protic solvents (e.g., MeOH and EtOH) (entries 1–4).
In contrast, using polar aprotic solvents (e.g., THF, ACN, DMF, and
DMSO) provided better conversions with 62–100% yield, DMSO
being the best solvent in this reaction condition (entries 5, 7, 8,
and 11). Several exceptions were also observed during the solvent
screening. For instance, a good yield (74%) was observed by using
the nonpolar 1,4-dioxane solvent (entry 6), but the reaction performed
poorly in NMP, a polar solvent (40% yield, entry 9). Moderate
yields were found by using Lipshutz’s Sonogoshira protocol
in water using 3% nonionic amphiphile PTS (entry 10).44 DMSO was carried through the screening of various bases
(entries 12–29). As expected, the lack of base afforded no
product (entry 12). A wide variety of inorganic bases produced excellent
yield over the course of 18 h (entries 13–16). Among them,
NaOAc was the only one that reached a high yield (86%) in 2 h (entry
13). Although KHCO3 as the base is less effective, Cs2CO3 and TBAF were found to be totally ineffective
(entries 17–19). Continuously, various organic bases were screened
under the same conditions. Sterically hindered amines, such as TMP, t-BuNH2, (i-Pr)2NH,
and Hunig’s base, reached high yields (>84%) in 2 h (entries
20–24). However, using Et2NH and Et3N
as the bases only produced product in moderate yield (56–58%)
after 18 h (entries 24 and 25). Some cyclic amines, e.g., pyrrolidine
and piperidine, were also effective bases, but required 18 h to reach
completion (entries 26 and 27). Morpholine and DBU were found to be
much less effective (entries 28 and 29). Of the bases, (i-Pr)2NH and TMP afforded product 3 (100%)
within 2 h, making them both attractive bases for this reaction. TMP
was used in subsequent optimization due to faster product formation
within 2 h; although, (i-Pr)2NH is a valuable
cost-effective substitute.

5 mol %), base (1.0 mmol), solvent (2.5 mL), rt for 18 h under argon
atmosphere.

b Yield was determined
by LC/MS with
pyrene as internal standard.

TMP was re-evaluated with alternative and sustainable solvents45 to broaden the applicability of these conditions
for purposes, such as process chemistry (Table S1). Although the THF/TMP combination was not as productive
as DMSO/TMP (Table S1, entry 1), high yields
were still obtained after 18 h (70%). Sustainable solvents, such as
2-MeTHF and sulfolane, were able to provide acceptable yields after
18 h if a greener solvent is desired (Table S1, entries 2 and 3). EtOAc, a solvent recommended for environmentally
friendly chemistry and a top 10 solvent used in GSK pilot operations
in 2005, was able to produce a 62% yield in 18 h that could likely
be increased with heating (Table S1, entry
4). ACN was the most effective solvent from this table (Table S1, entry 5) with product formation similar
to DMSO as the solvent, a positive result considering its use in process
chemistry and recommended use in medicinal chemistry.

TMP and
DMSO were chosen to evaluate catalyst loading (Table 3). The 5 mol % catalyst
loading produced a 96% yield in only 0.5 h, whereas a 2.5 mol % achieved
77% (entries 1 and 2). Both conditions were highly effective, reaching
100% yield in 1.5 h. Decreasing loading to 1 or cot0.5 mol % resulted
in significant product formation delays (48 and 42%, respectively),
though both went to completion by 18 h (entries 3 and 4). Increasing
the temperature to 60 and 100 °C allowed the catalyst load to
be decreased to 0.5 mol % while still achieving 80 and 85% yield,
respectively, in 0.5 h. For our purposes, a 2.5 mol % catalyst load
was chosen to limit palladium usage while retaining rapid product
formation at room temperature.

yield.

The attention was
then shifted to exploration of coupling partner
scope using the optimized reaction condition, namely, P2 (2.5 mol %), TMP, and DMSO. Various bromides were tested, and the
results are summarized in Scheme 1. In general, electron-withdrawing group-substituted
aryl bromides (5a–d and 5f–i) and heteroaryl bromides (5o–r) were completed within 2–4 h with high isolated yields
(65–92%). The exception was the 2-CF3 substitution
(5e), requiring 18 h to reach completion. Though the
aryl bromides with electron-donating substitutions (5j–n) had slightly lower yields (52–78%),
the electronic substitution effect seemed minimal. These examples
also demonstrated excellent tolerability of functional groups, including
nitrile, nitro group, ketone, carboxylic acid, ester, amide, as well
as unprotected hydroxyl (5l, 5m) and amino
(5n) groups. However, some heterocycles, such as 5t–aa, required slightly elevated temperature
(60 °C) to push to completion with moderate to good yields (42–87%).
Despite the challenging sterics of 4-bromo-3,5-dimethylisoxazole,
it achieved 61% conversion over 32 h, however, difficulty in purification
likely due to instability limited isolated yields (5z). In addition, an 87% yield was attained using 4-bromo-1H-indole in 6 h (5aa). The present protocol
is not applicable for aryl chlorides, as exemplified by 5i, only exhibiting bromide coupling.

Scheme 1 Scope of Bromides,,
Reaction conditions: 4 (0.5 mmol), 2 (0.8 mmol), P2 (2.5 mol
%), TMP (1.0 mmol), DMSO (2.5 mL), rt under argon atmosphere.

Isolated yield.

Stir at rt for 3 h then increase temperature
to 60 °C.

With the broad scope of bromides
obtained, various aryl- and alkyl-substituted
alkynes with electron-donating bromide 1 were then evaluated
(Scheme 2). The phenylacetylene
and aryl acetylene with electron-donating groups typically proceeded
to completion in 2 h with excellent isolated yields (7a–c). The heteroaryl acetylene, such as N-methylated
imidazole (7d), and aryl acetylene with electron-withdrawing
substitutions (7e–g) required prolonged
reaction time (12–24 h) to secure a good yield, but were still
completed at room temperature. Finally, the alkenyl- (7h) and alkyl (7i–n)-substituted alkynes
were efficiently coupled with 1 under similar conditions
to produce the desired product in excellent yield (75–96%).

Scheme 2 Coupling of 1 with Aryl and Alkyl Acetylenes,,
Reaction conditions: 4 (0.5 mmol), 6 (0.8
mmol), P2 (2.5 mol
%), TMP (1.0 mmol), DMSO (2.5 mL), rt with argon atmosphere.

Isolated yield.

Stir at rt for 3 h then increase temperature
to 60 °C.

To test the feasibility in
large-scale preparation, a 2 g scale
reaction was performed on 1 and 2 using
2.5 mol % catalyst loading. To our gratification, the reaction reached
100% conversion in 2 h with 92% isolated yield that further confirmed
the efficiency and effectiveness of this coupling protocol (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Indole Synthesis
via Sonogashira Coupling with 2-Bromoanilines,
Reaction conditions: 1. 8 (0.5 mmol), 9 (0.63 mmol), P2 (5.0
mol %), TMP (1.0 mmol), ACN (2.0 mL), rt under argon atmosphere. 2.
HCl (2.5 mmol), 90 °C.

Isolated yield.

To further test the utility
of these conditions, 2-bromoanilines
were coupled with various alkynes in hopes of intramolecular cyclization
to form the indole. Moderate yields were achieved using an unoptimized
one-pot indole synthesis utilizing the Sonogashira protocol followed
by refluxing in the presence of concentrated HCl. The method accommodated
both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating functionalities on
the bromide (10a–d), producing isolated
yields up to 78%. Additionally, the cyclization tolerated alkynes
containing an alkyl or phenol substituent while still maintaining
yields around 55% (10e, 10f). With further
optimization, we believe this one-pot approach may provide a rapid
pathway toward diverse indole library synthesis.

Conclusions
In
summary, a robust, copper-free Sonogashira coupling reaction
is described. Through extensive optimization campaign, the homogeneous
precatalyst P2, [DTBNpP] Pd(crotyl)Cl, was found to be
the most effective catalyst. Together with optimized base (TMP) and
solvent (DMSO), this condition provides a simple, mild, scalable,
and versatile alternative for the coupling of variety of aryl bromides
and alkynes. Additionally, this precatalyst provides rapid access
to indoles via the one-pot method, further expanding on the utility
of P2. We believe the preformed, air-stable P2 provides a reliable and more effective alternative to the commonly
used catalysts, such as Pd(PPh3)4 and PdCl2(PPh3)2, by retaining or surpassing
coupling efficiencies, bypassing in situ catalyst formation, forgoing
usage of pyrophoric agents, and decreasing the likelihood of catalyst
poisoning. A broad scope of both coupling partners together with high
functional group tolerability and excellent isolated yield makes it
an attractive addition to the existing Sonogashira coupling conditions
for chemical library generation, medicinal chemistry, and with potential
use in process chemistry.

Experimental Section
All commercial
solvents and reagents were purchased from commercial
sources and used without alteration. The modified water solvent (3%
PTS in H2O) was created using a 15% PTS in H2O stock from Sigma-Aldrich and water from our lab, heating to achieve
uniform consistency. Precatalysts were purchased from Strem Chemicals
(46-0028 (P8), 46-0365 (P13), 46-0358 (P11), 46-0385 (P9), 46-0275 (P6),
and 46-0295 (P7)), Johnson Matthey (Pd-162 (P1), Pd-163 (P2), Pd-170 (P4), Pd-178 (P3), and Pd-113 (P14)), and Sigma-Aldrich (RNI00185
(P10) and 794198 (P12)). Additional P2 was synthesized with procedures published by Seechurn et
al.36 NMR data comparing the commercially
available and homemade catalyst is provided in spectral data. Reaction
monitoring was performed on the Agilent 1200 series LC/MS containing
a Luna C18 (3 mm × 75 mm, 3 μm) reversed-phase column,
utilizing UV detection at λ = 220 nm. The LC/MS ran a 3 min
gradient spanning 4–100% acetonitrile in H2O modified
by trifluoroacetic acid (0.05%) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Flash
column chromatography was carried out on Teledyne Isco CombiFlash
Rf+ systems using 24G Isco Silica Gel columns (230–400 mesh)
and HPLC grade solvents. Products purified on 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were analyzed by the Varian 400 MHz in DMSO-d or CDCl3. 1H NMR spectra were referenced
to 7.26 ppm for CDCl3 and 2.50 ppm for DMSO-d. 13C NMR were referenced to 77.23 ppm for CDCl3 and 39.5 ppm for DMSO-d6. 31P NMR was referenced externally to 0.00 ppm for H3PO4. Splitting patterns are reported as: singlet (s), doublet
(d), triplet (t); quartet (q), septet (s), and other combinations
of these patterns. Coupling constants are reported in Hertz. High-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) was obtained by the Agilent 6210 Time-of-Flight
(TOF) LC/MS system. Proton and sodium adducts may be observed from
the salt exposure in the purification and mass spectrometry instrument.
In certain cases, heating was utilized.

microwave process vial (#355630), 2-bromoaniline
(0.50 mmol, 1.00 equiv), alkyne (0.63 mmol, 1.25 equiv), 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine
(169 μL, 1.00 mmol, 2.00 equiv), and P2 (10.33
mg, 0.025 mmol, 0.05 equiv) were added to ACN (1.0 mL). Remaining
ACN (1.0 mL) was added to rinse the sides. The reaction vessel was
sealed and bubbled with in-house argon for 5 min. The reaction was
stirred at room temperature for the designated time. Concentrated
HCl (2.50 mmol, 5.0 equiv) was added via syringe directly to the reaction
mixture and stirred at 90 °C for 9 h. Work up involved ammonium
chloride, EtOAc, and brine. The organic layer was concentrated and
purified on Isco silica gel columns to give the resulting product
using a gradient of 0–100% for ethyl acetate/hexanes.
