Oxide thermoelectric
materials are nontoxic, chemically and thermally
stable in oxidizing environments, cost-effective, and comparatively
simpler to synthesize. However, thermoelectric oxides exhibit comparatively
lower figure of merit (ZT) than that of metallic
alloy counterparts. In this study, nanoscale texturing and interface
engineering were utilized for enhancing the thermoelectric performance
of oxide polycrystalline Ca3Co4O9 materials, which were synthesized using conventional sintering and
spark plasma sintering (SPS) techniques. Results demonstrated that
nanoscale platelets (having layered structure with nanoscale spacing)
and metallic inclusions provide effective scattering of phonons, resulting
in lower thermal conductivity and higher ZT. Thermoelectric
measurement direction was found to have a significant effect on the
magnitude of ZT because of the strong anisotropy
in the transport properties induced by the layered nanostructure.
The peak ZT value for the Ca2.85Lu0.15Co3.95Ga0.05O9 specimen
measured along both perpendicular and parallel directions with respect
to the SPS pressure axis is found be 0.16 at 630 °C and 0.04
at 580 °C, respectively. The peak ZT of 0.25
at 670 °C was observed for the spark plasma-sintered Ca2.95Ag0.05Co4O9 sample. The estimated
output power of 2.15 W was obtained for the full size model, showing
high-temperature thermoelectric applicability of this nanostructured
material without significant oxidation.

1 Introduction
Thermoelectric (TE) modules are promising for generating electricity
from wasted heat in industrial sectors and other electromechanical
processes.1 In order to realize an efficient
TE module, it is essential to find high-performance materials with
excellent durability and robustness over high-temperature regime in
air.2,3 Oxide TE materials are desirable for harvesting
energy at high-temperature environments such as automobile exhaust,
jet engines, and industrial plants.2,4 Most of the
commercial TE materials based upon Bi–Te are suitable for low-temperature
applications (below 150 °C).5 Other
materials being researched such as skutterudites and Pb–Te
alloys are only suitable up to 400 °C or below in air.6,7 Half-Heusler alloy can operate up to 500 °C in air but for
short time and challenge with respect to the long term thermal cycling.8 Moreover, volatile elements such as Bi and Pb
in TE materials could come out of the lattice during prolonged high-temperature
operation, which in turn may degrade their TE properties eventually.
On the other hand, oxide materials are stable over temperatures exceeding
400–500 °C in air and thus provide a viable solution for
high-temperature deployment.

The effectiveness of a TE material
for power generation is determined
by a dimensionless figure of merit, (ZT), given as  where α
is the Seebeck coefficient,
σ is the electrical conductivity, T is the
absolute temperature, and κ represents the thermal conductivity.
From this relation, the TE material should have high Seebeck coefficient
and electrical conductivity with low thermal conductivity. Therefore,
an ideal TE material should have a narrow band gap and high mobility
carriers behaving like a “phonon-glass/electron-crystal”,9 that is, it should have low thermal conductivity
similar to that of an amorphous or glasslike material and high electrical
conductivity of a crystalline material. In practice, TE parameters
α, σ, and κ are closely interrelated, making it
challenging to adjust the electrical and thermal properties independently.

The oxide TE material NaCo2O4 has been shown
to exhibit a high Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity.
However, it has a poor thermal stability because of the presence of
volatile Na ions.10 NaCo2O4 has been found to be sensitive to the humidity with increasing
temperature.11,12 Out of other possibilities for
oxide materials, Ca3Co4O9 has emerged
as a promising candidate for high-temperature (<900 °C) applications
because of its reasonable TE performance and chemical stability. Additionally,
it can be fabricated from inexpensive precursors using conventional
ceramic fabrication process. The highest reported ZT value for a Ca3Co4O9 single crystal
was reported to be ∼0.87 at 700 °C,13 which was attributed to its unique layered structure consisting
of stacks of a conductive layer [CoO2] and an insulating
layer [Ca2CoO3].14 The misfit layered structure and the weak connection between these
two substructure layers were considered to result in significant phonon
scattering which assisted in reducing the thermal conductivity.15 However, the single crystal material is expensive
and has scalability challenges.

In order to fabricate a high-quality
single-phase Ca3Co4O9 material, Kang
et al. suggested a postcalcination-based
fabrication method; however, they did not report the ZT value.16 Alternative methods, such as
hot pressing and spark plasma sintering (SPS), have also been used
to synthesize high-density unmodified and doped Ca3Co4O9. The substitution of heavier and smaller Lu3+ ions on Ca sites has been shown to provide a ZT value of 0.36 at 800 °C through modification of NaCl-type [Ca2CoO3] layer of Ca3Co4O9.17 The increased ZT was obtained because of the reduced thermal conductivity and increased
Seebeck coefficient as a result of reduced Co4+ concentration.17 The Ga3+ substitution has been found
to improve the TE properties (ZT ≈ 0.26 at
700 °C) of SPS-fabricated Ca3Co4O9.18 The Ga atoms were found to be preferentially
located on the Co-sites in the NaCl-type [Ca2CoO3] layer increasing effective phonon scattering and thereby the reduced
thermal conductivity. The main reason for the lower ZT value of the polycrystalline oxide in comparison to its single crystal
counterpart is its lower power factor (α2σ)
resulting from lower electrical conductivity and lower Seebeck coefficient.
The TE properties of polycrystalline systems can be modified by controlling
microstructural factors such as grain size, grain orientation, grain
boundary, and density.

The Ca3Co4O9 system becomes unstable
on heating above 926 °C, as it starts to decompose into various
phases including Ca3Co2O6 and CoO
solid solution with CaO.19 The synthesis
of Ca3Co4O9 is performed using a
conventional solid–state reaction from CaCO3 and
Co3O4. The samples prepared from calcined powders
are sintered at 850 °C or above. For the Ca3Co4O9 ceramics, the thermal conductivity is found
to be in the range of 0.4–1.1 W/m·K depending on structure
and morphology.20 To improve the TE properties
of the Ca3Co4O9 ceramics through
microstructure control, many processing techniques have been examined
including texturing process and dual-doping.21−25

To date, nanostructured materials have been
employed for improving
TE efficiency of TE generators. Nanosized powders and pores introduce
defects and increase the density of grain boundaries giving rise to
strong scattering of long wavelength phonons, which results in reduced
thermal conductivity.9 The Ag doping/alloying
in Ca3Co4O9 has been considered as
one of the promising nanostructuring methods because of its significant
dual role, acting both as electrical connectors between grains and
phonon scattering center.26,27 The Ag inclusions with
new interfaces lead to an increased effective phonon scattering to
suppress the lattice thermal conductivity. Because Ag has high atomic
mass and comparable ionic radius (1.15 Å) with Ca (1.00 Å),
the carriers and phonon scattering centers can be tuned simultaneously
for modulating the electrical and thermal transport.28 The addition of Ag nanoparticles has also been found to
facilitate a preferential orientation of the grains (texturing) in
Ca3Co4O9.29

In prior literature, the nature of anisotropic properties
modified
through ion doping has not been investigated in detail. Here, we demonstrate
the effect of codoping at Ca and Co sites on the TE response of Ca3Co4O9 and investigate the anisotropic
behavior. The schematic view of the crystalline structure of Ca3Co4O9 and the partial substitution of
Lu/Ga on Ca/Co sites in the Ca2CoO3 insulating
layer is provided in Figure S1. Building
upon the systematic experimental results, we provide a fundamental
understanding of the mechanism responsible for the enhanced TE properties
of SPS-fabricated p-type Ca3Co4O9 with Lu3+/Ga3+ codoping. Figure 1 shows the conceptual illustration
of the randomly oriented Ca3Co4O9 and nanoscale-textured Ca3Co4O9 with Ag inclusions. The microstructure of Ca3Co4O9 was tailored by doping heavy ions and metallic inclusions.
This strategy resulted in preferentially oriented platelike nanostructure
along favorable electrical transport direction.

Figure 1 Conceptual illustration
of the randomly oriented Ca3Co4O9 and nanoscale-textured Ca3Co4O9 with Ag inclusions.

Here, we report the nanoscale texturing mechanism for the
nanostructured
high-performance p-type TE oxide material Ca3Co4O9 through nanoscale platelets and Ag inclusions. A novel
nanoscale texturing approach has been demonstrated to enhance the
power factor of Ca3Co4O9 with significant
reduction in the thermal conductivity. The Lu/Ga doping on the Ca/Co
sites with embedded nanosized inclusions, resulted in enhanced TE
properties because of the preferred grain orientation and reduced
lattice thermal conductivity. The microstructure of the SPS-fabricated
sample indicated that the Ag and heavier ions play a significant role
in nanoscale texturing of Ca3Co4O9. Collectively, this work provides fundamental understanding of the
enhanced TE response in textured and nanostructured Ca3Co4O9-based TE materials.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Phase Composition and Microstructure
of Lu
and Ga Codoped Ca3Co4O9
Figure S2a shows X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of Ca3–xLuxCo4–yGayO9 ceramics (x, y = 0, x = 0.05, y = 0.15,
and x = 0.15, y = 0.05). All the
XRD peaks were indexed to the Ca3Co4O9 phase, indicating that there is no secondary phase. Ca3Co4O9 has a layered structure which consists
of two monoclinic subsystems with identical a, c, and β parameters but has a different b-axis length.15,30 All the diffraction peaks agree
well with the reported monoclinic structure. Moreover, the big peak-shifts
in Ca3Co4O9 samples from cold isostatic
pressing (CIP) to SPS were found at 2θ ≈ 16.5° and
33.4°, as shown in Figure S2a. Because
Lu3+ (0.861 Å) and Ga3+ (0.62 Å) ions
have smaller ionic radii than Ca2+ (1.00 Å),31 the (002) and (004) diffraction peaks of codoped
samples shifted to higher 2θ angles as compared to the pristine
Ca3Co4O9 sample (Figure S2a, inset). Here, for the CIP sample, we utilized
a postcalcination method to synthesize a single-phase Ca3Co4O9 ceramics from the calcined powder at
900 °C. Previously, Kang et al. reported the single phase XRD
results for the Ca3Co4O9 ceramics
sintered at 1200 °C with the postcalcination (with heating at
900 °C for 12 h after cooling below 700 °C).16 In the present work, the XRD results indicated
single-phase (without secondary phases) Ca3Co4O9 ceramics, as shown in Figure S2a. The Rietveld method was carried out to refine XRD data, as shown
in Figure S3. The refined diffraction patterns
show that all the samples have monoclinic symmetry and the lattice
parameters were calculated to confirm the codoping effect on the crystallographic
structure. Table S1 presents the chemical
compositions and lattice parameters of the pure and codoped samples.
It is very clear that the lattice parameters were changed after codoping.
Thus, the variation in the lattice parameters indicate that Lu3+ (0.861 Å) and Ga3+ (0.62 Å) ions have
been substituted at the Ca-site (Ca2+: 1.00 Å) and
Co-site (low spin Co3+/high spin Co3+/Co4+ = 0.545 Å/0.61 Å/0.53 Å), respectively.

The microstructures of the Ca3–xLuxCo4–yGayO9 ceramics (x, y = 0, x = 0.05, y = 0.15, and x = 0.15, y = 0.05) were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as
shown in Figure S2b–d. Cross-sectional
images indicate a highly anisotropic lamella-like structure. The Ca3Co4O9 samples prepared using the CIP
method had a relative density of 82%. However, the Ca3Co4O9 sample synthesized by SPS had a high relative
density of 96%. Additionally, SPS-processed Lu and Ga codoped Ca3–xLuxCo4–yGayO9 samples (x = 0.05, y =
0.15 and x = 0.15, y = 0.05) show
a higher relative density of 96% with a closed pore structure. All
the samples consisted of the platelet-type grains stacked with same
orientation.22 The average grain size and
the thickness of platelets for the pure Ca3Co4O9 was in the range of 1.8–2.1 μm and 113–123
nm, respectively, as shown in Figure 2 and Table S2. However,
Lu and Ga codoped Ca3Co4O9 exhibited
a smaller average grain size (0.8–1.0 μm) and thinner
platelets (34–78 nm). The thickness of platelets was found
to vary with different Lu/Ga concentrations. This phenomenon was attributed
to Lu/Ga ionic radius and substitution site. Because the difference
in the ionic radius between Lu3+ (0.861 Å) and Ca2+ (1.00 Å) is higher than that between Ga3+ (0.62 Å) and low spin Co3+/high spin Co3+/Co4+ (0.545 Å/0.61 Å/0.53 Å),31 the sample containing high concentration of
Lu3+ ion exhibited thinner platelets. Consequently, smaller
grains reduced the phonon mean free path, resulting in the lower lattice
thermal conductivity. Furthermore, thinner platelets created more
interfaces compared to thicker platelets, which increased electron
scattering, resulting in lowering electrical conductivity.

Bright field transmission electron microscopy (BF-TEM) images
of
the SPS sample for Ca3Co4O9 showed
typical polygonal grains with several micrometers dimension and polycrystalline
layered structure, as shown in Figure S4a,b. Selected area electron diffraction of the different grains also
indicated randomly oriented grains. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images
of grain boundaries between three adjacent grains are displayed in Figure S4c,d. The randomly oriented grains with
the high-angle grain boundaries were found to exist in the samples,
and thus, the boundary is expected to participate in scattering of
phonons effectively.32Figure S4e,f shows high resolution images of grain boundaries
and from these images grain boundary width is calculated to be 2 nm.

2.2 Phase Analysis and Microstructure of Textured
Ca3Co4O9 with Ag Inclusions
The XRD plot for the Ca3–x–zAgzLuxCo4–yGayO9 (x = 0–0.05, y = 0–0.05, z = 0–0.05) samples
is shown in Figure 3. It is clearly seen that most of the diffraction peaks can be indexed
to the Ca3Co4O9 structure.15 An additional peak at 2θ = 38.5°
was indexed to Ag (JCPDS card # 01-1167), which can also be observed
for the heavy-ion-doped Ca3Co4O9 with
low Ag content (x = 0.05). The Ag dopants are prone
to agglomerate at the grain boundaries as a secondary phase,26 while Lu/Ga substitution will occur on Ca/Co
sites. Figure 3a shows
randomly oriented Ca3Co4O9 phase
in CS sample, whereas the XRD patterns for the SPS samples exhibit
strong diffraction peaks along the c-axis direction,
indicating evolution of texturing as shown in Figure 3b. Although Ag was used as an inclusion,
Ag+ entered into the Ca3Co4O9 lattice at Ca2+ sites, as can be seen in terms
of the variation in lattice parameters (Table S3). The inevitable Ca-site defects were originated from the
inserted Ag inclusions, which acted as phonon scattering centers to
lower the thermal conductivity.

Figure 3 XRD patterns for the samples of Ca3Co4O9, Ca2.95Ag0.05Co4O9, Ca2.9Ag0.05Lu0.05Co4O9, and Ca2.95Ag0.05Co3.95Ga0.05O9 processed
by (a) CS and (b) SPS.

In order to estimate the effect of nanoscale texturing and
engineered
interfaces on the microstructure of Ca3Co4O9 samples, the Lotgering factors method was employed to quantify
the grain orientation degree of the SPS samples. The Lotgering factors F can be described as33  where P = ∑I{00l}/∑I{hkl}, I is the intensity
of the diffraction peak and P is calculated from
XRD patterns of Ca3–x–zAgzLuxCo4–yGayO9 (x = 0–0.05, y = 0–0.05, z = 0–0.05) samples
in Figure 3. P0 is calculated from XRD plot for randomly oriented
Ca3Co4O9 sample shown in Figure 3a. The calculated
Lotgering factor increased from 0.63 to 0.82, as summarized in Table 1. The platelets within
the matrix of the doped Ca3Co4O9 samples
were highly oriented, which led to the favorable effect on the electrical
transport of Ca3Co4O9.

Ca2.95Ag0.05Co3.95Ga0.05O9	0.05	0	0.05	0.80	0.61	
The result indicated that the doping
of Ag is favorable to promote
the grain orientation.29 Ag is a key factor
in textured Ca3Co4O9 materials to
create nanoscale-thin platelike grains with more interfaces and facilitate
the preferred grain orientation. Because Ag is soft and plastic (Mohs
hardness: 2.5), a small amount of Ag in the Ca3Co4O9 matrix can be deformed during the pressing process.
Thus, it is very easy for the platelike grains to be more oriented
under pressure than in the absence of Ag. It has been found that oriented
grains can increase the electrical conductivity because of the reduced
scattering of charge carriers at the grain boundaries and because
of their shorter diffusion path.15Figure S5 shows the field emission SEM (FESEM)
images of the fractured surface of Ca3–x–zAgzLuxCo4–yGayO9 (x = 0–0.05, y = 0–0.05, z = 0–0.05) samples.
The porous microstructure existed in the CS samples, whereas SPS samples
had the dense microstructure. The pure and doped Ca3Co4O9 CS samples were found to be randomly oriented;
however, the lamellar texture containing highly oriented grains was
observed in the Ag-doped SPS samples, exhibiting enhanced Lotgering
factors (0.73–0.82). The SEM micrographs of textured samples
show preferred grain orientations in Ca3Co4O9 samples, which was consistent with XRD results. The back-scattered
electron (BSE) images of the doped Ca3Co4O9 SPS samples and the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) elemental mapping images of Ag in the respective samples are
shown in Figure 4.

processed by SPS. The EDS elemental mapping images
show the distributed Ag inclusions.

The EDS images display the distribution of Ag in the doped
Ca3Co4O9 samples indicating Ag as
a metallic
inclusion in the Ca3Co4O9 matrix.
Ag was found to exist preferentially at the boundaries between platelets,
which gave rise to a mixture of nanosized and microsized inclusions,
as shown in Figure 5a–d. In our material system (doped Ca3Co4O9 SPS samples), Ag inclusions were randomly distributed
mainly along the grain boundaries in sizes ranging from hundreds of
nanometers to micrometers, which is important for scattering wide
range of phonon spectrum.

It can be noted that the Ag inclusions had various morphology
such
as spherical shape, angular shape, and plate shape with the size ranging
from several hundreds of nanometers to micrometers. Figure 5e,f shows HR-TEM images for
the Ca2.95Ag0.05Co4O9 sample.
The layered nanostructure was maintained in the sample, and the inset
in Figure 5e shows
the fast Fourier-transformed pattern. The d spacing
of planes of Ca2.95Ag0.05Co4O9 along the c-axis was found to be about 10
Å, in accordance with d spacing calculated from
the 00l peaks of the XRD (Figure 3). The BF-TEM images of the sample showed
typical polygonal grains with the size of several hundreds of nanometers,
as shown in Figure 5g,h.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were performed
to
identify the Co valence states of the pure and doped Ca3Co4O9 samples because the electrical transport
occurs by the hopping of a hole from Co4+ to Co3+.34Figure 6 shows the 2p XPS spectra of Co ions analyzed from
Ca3–x–yAgxLuyCo4–zGazO9 (x = 0–0.05, y =
0–0.05, z = 0–0.05) polycrystalline
samples. According to the literature, for the Co4+ state,
the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks take place at 796.8
and 781.4 eV, respectively, while for the Co3+ state, the
2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks exist at 794.8 and 779.6
eV, respectively.35,36 The binding energies of all the
samples were observed between the values expected for Co4+ and Co3+, indicating that Co4+ and Co3+ valence states coexist in the samples. The Co 2p XPS spectrum
had two main peaks with a spin-orbital splitting of ∼15.0 eV,37 2p3/2 at 780.0 eV and 2p1/2 at 795.0 eV, as shown in Figure 6. The Co 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks
for the pure Ca3Co4O9 sample occurred
at 796.1 and 780.5 eV, respectively. However, two weak satellite peaks
occurred at 789.5 and 804.5 eV in the doped Ca3Co4O9 samples, which indicated the existence of Co3+.38 By curve fitting, the concentration
change of Co3+ and Co4+ was determined in the
doped Ca3Co4O9 samples, and was compared
with the pure Ca3Co4O9 sample. The
areas under the fitted curves for Co3+ and Co4+ were calculated to determine the concentration of Co3+ and Co4+, respectively. Table 2 shows the calculated relative atomic concentration
of Co3+ and Co4+. It was clearly observed that
a small amount of Ag-doping is not effective in changing the concentration
of Co3+ and Co4+ ions; however, additional Lu
or Ga doping suppressed the Co4+ concentration significantly.
The lower concentration of Co4+ was found in both Ca2.9Ag0.05Lu0.05Co4O9 and Ca2.95Ag0.05Co3.95Ga0.05O9 samples.

2.3 TE Properties of Lu and
Ga Codoped Ca3Co4O9
The
TE properties were
evaluated through conventional measurement configuration (evaluation
of in-plane electrical properties and out-of-plane thermal properties)
to compare material characteristics with that of reported in prior
literature. Please note that several prior studies have assumed that
the TE properties of the material are isotropically homogeneous. The
temperature-dependent electrical conductivity curve indicated a semiconductor-like
behavior for the SPS-based samples, as shown in Figure 7a. The electrical conductivity of CIP-based
samples becomes lower than that of the SPS-based samples above 400
°C. This decrease in conductivity was explained by noticing the
decrease in carrier concentration that also resulted in increase in
the Seebeck coefficient.39 The lower electrical
conductivity of the CIP sample was related to the randomly oriented
platelets and low density. At high temperatures (>400 °C),
the
decrease in carrier concentration in CIP sample originated from the
loss of oxygen during measurements in the helium atmosphere. Low-density
CIP sample had large interconnected pores, and thus, both the kinetics
and the thermodynamics were favorable for oxygen-loss above 400 °C.18 According to the literature, Ca3Co4O9 tends to lose oxygen around 447–457 °C40 in air and 347–357 °C41 under a nitrogen atmosphere. However, the porosity
of the SPS samples was low, which helped in reducing the loss of oxygen.

and x = 0.15, y = 0.05) from the
conventional TE measurement.

Figure 7b
displays
the in-plane Seebeck coefficient as a function of temperature for
the Ca3–xLuxCo4–yGayO9 samples (x, y = 0, x = 0.05, y = 0.15, and x = 0.15, y = 0.05). All the samples exhibited
a positive Seebeck coefficient, indicating p-type behavior. The Seebeck
coefficient of the CIP sample was significantly smaller than that
for all of the SPS samples across the measured temperature range because
the grain alignment was less pronounced in the CIP sample. Among the
SPS samples, the Ca2.95Lu0.05Co3.85Ga0.15O9 composition was found to have lower
Seebeck coefficient. According to the room temperature Hall effect
measurements, as shown in Table 3, the degraded Seebeck coefficient resulted from the
high carrier concentration (1.09 × 1019 cm–3) and low hall mobility (50 cm2/V·s). The relationship
between the Seebeck coefficient and the carrier concentration can
be described as  where kB is Boltzmann’s
constant, h is Planck’s constant, e is the charge of an electron, n is the
carrier concentration, and m* is the effective mass
of the carrier.

When the Lutetium fraction increases from 0.05 to
0.15 with decreased
Gallium fraction from 0.15 to 0.05, the carrier concentration decreases
from 1.09 × 1019 to 1.91 × 1018 cm–3. All samples show different hall mobility (μH) values at a measured n, as shown in Table 3. These values were
around 2430, 50, and 230 cm2/V·s for the Ca3Co4O9, Ca2.95Lu0.05Co3.85Ga0.15O9, and Ca2.85Lu0.15Co3.95Ga0.05O9 systems,
respectively. The increased in-plane electrical conductivity for the
Ca2.95Lu0.05Co3.85Ga0.15O9 sample at room temperature was associated with the
change in charge carrier concentration. Thus, high-concentration Ga
doping introduced more hole carriers, which was consistent with room-temperature
Hall measurements. However, the decreased carrier concentration for
the Ca2.85Lu0.15Co3.95Ga0.05O9 sample resulted in lower in-plane electrical conductivity
at room temperature. The purpose of room temperature measurement of
carrier concentration is to evaluate the effect of Lu and Ga codoping
on the TE performance improvement. The power factor is evaluated by
Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. According to the
literature, the maximum power factor is in the carrier concentration
range between 1018 and 1020 cm–3,2 as shown in Figure S6. Thus, we controlled the carrier concentration of the Ca3Co4O9 sample and carrier concentrations
of the Lu and Ga codoped samples were found to be in the range between
1018 and 1020 cm–3 at room
temperature, as shown in Table 3. Interestingly, the enhanced TE performance originated mainly
from the significant reduction in thermal conductivity because of
the phonon scattering through the point defects.

The results
indicate that the carrier concentration decreases with
Lu3+ doping, which can be attributed to the substitution
of trivalent Lu3+ for divalent Ca2+. In terms
of valence equilibrium, it can introduce Co3+ ions and
decrease the hole carrier concentration. The Hall mobility value of
each sample was in good agreement with the carrier concentration value
of the same composition.

The calculated power factors of all
the samples are shown in Figure 7c. Because the undoped
Ca3Co4O9 sample produced by SPS exhibited
the highest electrical conductivity above 300 °C with a large
Seebeck coefficient, it had the largest power factor of 5.3 μW/cm·K2 at 630 °C. The power factor of the Ca3Co4O9 sample produced by SPS was significantly improved
in comparison to the CIP sample (2.2 μW/cm·K2 at 630 °C).

The out-of-plane thermal conductivity of
the Ca3Co4O9 samples is shown in Figure 7d. The relative density
of CIP sample was
found to be 82%, while the relative density of CS sample was found
to be 57%. In the relatively high-density CIP sample, the porosity
was low and the oxygen out-diffusion kinetics was less favorable than
the CS sample. Thus, the thermal conductivity of the CIP sample (Figure 7d) is higher than
the value of the CS sample (the value will be shown in Figure 9d). The samples containing
Lu and Ga exhibited lower thermal conductivity because of nanoscale
interfaces, which could create additional phonon scattering. Thus,
these results demonstrate that Lu and Ga codoping was an effective
method to reduce the thermal conductivity of Ca3Co4O9 produced by SPS. As shown in Figure S2d,e, the grains with random orientations in these
samples also effectively scatter phonons with various mean free path
lengths to reduce the thermal conductivity.42 The doping of two smaller and heavier Lutetium and Gallium ions
in the Ca2CoO3 led to an increase in nanoscale
boundary scattering and a subsequent decrease in the lattice thermal
conductivity. The point defect scattering results from mass fluctuations
and lattice distortion. Considering the difference in mass between
the dopant Lu/Ga ions and the host Ca/Co ions, the partial substitution
of Lu/Ga for Ca/Co resulted in local vibrational changes. Furthermore,
this doping led to lattice distortion because of the difference in
ionic radius between the dopant and host ions. Therefore, the phonon
mean free path is diminished by these substitutions and this effect
causes a reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity of Ca3Co4O9. Among all of the SPS samples, the Ca2.85Lu0.15Co3.95Ga0.05O9 sample had a lowest thermal conductivity of 1.9 W/m·K
above 300 °C.

The ZT of the Ca3–xLuxCo4–yGayO9 samples
(x, y = 0, x =
0.05, y = 0.15, and x = 0.15, y = 0.05) is shown as a function of temperature in Figure 7e. The Ca2.85Lu0.15Co3.95Ga0.05O9 sample
produced by SPS reached the maximum ZT value of 0.24
at 630 °C during the conventional TE measurement. Overall, Lu
and Ga codoping successfully reduced the thermal conductivity because
of the nanoscale boundary scattering while only slightly reducing
the electrical conductivity. This had a positive effect on the dimensionless
figure of merit ZT. However, these layered nanostructure
materials had a very high directional dependence. For this reason,
the TE properties of Ca3Co4O9 samples
were measured along both perpendicular and parallel directions.

The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity, Seebeck
coefficient, and power factor along perpendicular and parallel directions
can be seen in Figure 8. The electrical conductivities were found to increase with temperature
for both directions, and all of the samples measured along the parallel
direction exhibited a significant decrease in the electrical conductivities
because of the layered nanostructure. Furthermore, it is obvious that
the Seebeck coefficient is sensitive to the measurement direction
in high temperature ranges, as shown in Figure 8b. The maximum Seebeck coefficient value
of 227 μV/K was measured at 630 °C along the perpendicular
direction, which was higher than that of the result of Wu et al. reporting
the values of samples fabricated by autocombustion synthesis and SPS.43 Because the electrical conductivities and Seebeck
coefficient values measured along the perpendicular direction exceeded
the values measured along the parallel direction at high temperature
ranges, the power factor difference in between perpendicular and parallel
directions was pronounced with increasing temperature. However, the
thermal conductivities measured along both directions (Figure 8d) were higher than the reported
values from Ca3Co4O9 polycrystalline
samples.24 All of the codoped samples show
lower thermal conductivity than the values of nondoped samples for
each direction, which was still effective in terms of nanoscale boundary
scattering. Also, all of the samples measured along the parallel direction
exhibited reduced thermal conductivities as compared to the perpendicular
direction because of the different grain alignment and orientation.
The results of the present study show similarity to those found in
the earlier experimental studies on bismuth telluride.44,45 In n-type Bi2Te3–ySey, the electrical and thermal conductivities
along the in-plane (perpendicular direction to the pressure) were
almost 4 and 2 times larger than those along the applied pressure
direction, respectively, because of the lamellar structure and the
weak van der Waals bonding between Te–Te.46,47

and x = 0.15, y = 0.05) measured
along the perpendicular and parallel directions to the SPS pressure
axis.

The ZT values
calculated for both directions are
shown as a function of temperature in Figure 8e. The highest ZT value
along the perpendicular direction was found to be 0.16 at 630 °C,
whereas the maximum ZT value along the parallel direction
was found to be 0.04 at 580 °C. When considering the ratio of
the ZT values, the value along the perpendicular
direction is 3 to 4 times higher than the value along the parallel
direction. Such measurement results suggest that perpendicular direction
to the SPS pressure axis should be the preferred direction for practical
TE applications.

2.4 TE Properties of Textured
Ca3Co4O9 with Ag Inclusions
Even after Lu/Ga
doping, the electrical conductivity of the Ca3Co4O9 is still relatively low. Thus, Ag inclusions were incorporated
into the Ca3Co4O9 matrix in order
to facilitate the preferred grain orientation and further improve
the electrical conductivity of the Ca3Co4O9. The TE properties were evaluated using in-plane electrical
properties and out-of-plane thermal properties in order to compare
material characteristics with published literature. Figure 9a shows the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity,
indicating a semiconductor-like behavior as the electrical conductivity
increases with temperature. The Ag-doped Ca3Co4O9 SPS samples exhibited a higher electrical conductivity
than that of the pure Ca3Co4O9. The
values were enhanced when only small amounts of Ag were doped in the
pure Ca3Co4O9, which agreed well
with the increasing degree of orientation. However, all CS samples
exhibited a poor electrical conductivity because of porous microstructure.

coefficient, (c) power factor, (d–f) thermal conductivity,

samples from the conventional TE measurement.

According to the prior report, the misfit-layered Ca3Co4O9 has anisotropic transport properties.43 The grain orientation along the (00l) direction dominates the electrical conductivity in the ab-plane.48 The (00l) grain-oriented Ca3Co4O9 samples
exhibited higher electrical conductivity because of higher carrier
mobility along the (00l) direction. Here, Ag was
found to be beneficial in nanoscale texturing of Ca3Co4O9 along the c-axis orientation,
thus enhancing the electrical conductivity along the ab-plane. Furthermore, Ag inclusions were expected to increase the
carrier concentration because of the formation of an impurity level
narrow band gap.29 The Seebeck coefficient
for all CS and SPS samples was positive, as shown in Figure 9b, indicating that holes were
the dominant charge carriers in the electrical transport. The value
of the Seebeck coefficient of the pure Ca3Co4O9 CS sample at 100 °C was 129 μV/K. Moreover,
with the SPS process, the above value exhibited a steady rise till
670 °C. Compared to the SPS samples, the CS samples represented
a sudden increase in the Seebeck coefficient above 400 °C. The
Seebeck coefficient is inversely proportional to the carrier concentration.
Therefore, the higher electrical conductivity resulting from higher
carrier concentration indicates a lower Seebeck coefficient of SPS
samples in the high temperature range, which is consistent with the
previous results.

The calculated power factors for all the samples
are shown in Figure 9c. The power factor
of SPS samples exhibited a monotonous increase with the increasing
temperature, and its maximum value was recorded at 670 °C. However,
the CS samples exhibited poor power factor values <1.0 μW/cm·K2 because of the lower electrical conductivity over the entire
temperature range. The power factor values of the CS samples (0.2–0.8
μW/cm·K2) were reduced in comparison to the
SPS samples (1.2–4.2 μW/cm·K2). The value
for the SPS sample was 5–6 times higher than that of the corresponding
value for the CS sample.

The out-of-plane thermal conductivity
of the Ca3Co4O9 samples is shown
in Figure 9d. Among
SPS samples, the ones containing
Ag inclusions exhibited lower thermal conductivity because of the
effective phonon scattering. The thermal conductivity values were
reduced for the Ag-doped Ca3Co4O9 ceramics with magnitude of 2.0–1.5 W/m·K over the temperature
range of 100–670 °C. These results clearly demonstrated
that the Ag inclusions were effective in reducing the thermal conductivity
of Ca3Co4O9. However, the CS samples
exhibited much lower thermal conductivity (0.4–0.8 W/m·K)
because of porous microstructure, which hindered phonon transport.
The total thermal conductivity (κ) is the sum of electronic
thermal conductivity (κe) and lattice thermal conductivity
(κl), κ = κe + κl. Because the electrical conductivity is tied to electronic
thermal conductivity through the Wiedemann–Franz law (κe = LσT, where L is the Lorentz number and T is the absolute
temperature), the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity
are interrelated. The doped Ca3Co4O9 SPS samples exhibited a higher κe than that of
the pure Ca3Co4O9 due to the increasing
σ. Therefore, the higher κe value of the Ca2.95Ag0.05Co4O9 sample was
attributed to the higher σ value among all the samples, as shown
in Figure 9a,e. However,
all the CS samples showed poor κe values because
of lower electrical conductivity values. The slight reduction in total
thermal conductivity of the doped Ca3Co4O9 SPS samples, as compared to the pure Ca3Co4O9 SPS sample, was found to be associated with
the strong phonon scattering caused by the increased boundaries, nanoplatelets,
and nanodefects resulting from the nanoscale texturing with Ag inclusions. Figure 9d,f shows that the
lowest κ and κl value was achieved for the
Ca2.95Ag0.05Co4O9 SPS
sample because of the higher texturing degree, which agrees well with
its higher Lotgering factor.

To further analyze the contributing
factors in the thermal conductivity
reduction, we need to understand the source of scattering centers.
Phonons are termed as acoustic or optical phonons based on their polarization.
Out of these, acoustic phonons are associated with the lattice thermal
conductivity. The total thermal conductivity is mainly determined
by various scattering processes, such as phonon–phonon scattering,
charge carriers, lattice disorder (vacancies, interstitials, and dopants),
boundaries, interfaces, and inclusions, all of which limit the phonon
mean free path. Short wavelength phonons are mostly scattered by impurity
atoms, whereas long wavelength phonons are scattered by larger structure
such as boundaries and interfaces.49 Considering
phonon scattering, the lattice thermal conductivity can be described
as50  where C is the specific heat
at constant volume, v is the average velocity of
sound in a material, and l is phonon mean free path.
The mean free path l indicates the distance between
collisions through random phonon scattering. Nanostructure in materials
can lead to a spatial confinement of phonons and affect phonon dispersion.
Thus, the acoustic phonons can be scattered when the structure is
similar or smaller than the mean free path of phonons. Long wavelength
acoustic phonons that have low frequency and long mean free path would
be hindered from transport. The acoustic impedance mismatch also plays
an important role in phonon reflection at the interface.51 In nanostructured bulk materials, strong phonon
scattering would occur to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity
because of a high density of nanostructures. In other words, nanostructures
in bulk materials can lead to lattice misfit and large strain (acoustic
impedance mismatch). Therefore, the inclusions in the Ca3Co4O9 system block the propagation of mid-to-long-wavelength
phonons, resulting in reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity.

The ZT of the Ca3–x–zAgzLuxCo4–yGayO9 (x = 0–0.05, y = 0–0.05, z = 0–0.05) samples
is shown as a function of temperature in Figure 9g. The maximum ZT value
of 0.25 at 670 °C was obtained for the Ca2.95Ag0.05Co4O9 SPS sample from the conventional
TE measurement, indicating about 100% enhancement as compared to all
the CS samples and 50% enhancement compared to the pure Ca3Co4O9 SPS sample. Overall, the nanoscale texturing
in conjunction with Ag inclusions successfully increased the electrical
conductivity and reduced the thermal conductivity simultaneously because
of the preferred grain orientation and nanoscale-defect-induced phonon
scattering. This improved the dimensionless figure of merit ZT. This study demonstrates that the nanoscale texturing
along with the inclusions could be a promising route toward improving
the TE performance of a material. This study can be extended to other
anisotropic material systems for improving their TE performance. Furthermore,
the nanoscale texturing refinement and inclusions of various other
metals could be utilized and implemented to achieve even higher improvement
in ZT.

2.5 Modeling Module Performance
In order
to evaluate the effect of nanoscale texturing and engineered interfaces
on TE performance of Ca3Co4O9, a
TE module including both n and p-type was designed and simulated with
nanostructured ZnO52 and textured Ca3Co4O918 samples,
as shown in the inset of Figure 10a. A pair of n-type ZnO and p-type Ca3Co4O9-based materials was selected for the 7.5 ×
3.75 × 5.52 mm3 module. The model with the ZnO and
Ca3Co4O9 was made with given boundary
conditions, which were at fixed temperatures on both hot and cold
side, as indicated in the inset of Figure 10a. The size for the TE generator legs was
2.4 × 2.4 × 4 mm3. The detailed modeling conditions
of the TE generator can be found in a paper by Lee et al.53 The newly developed Ca2.95Ag0.05Co3.95Ga0.05O9 shows a ZT value of 0.15 at 430 °C, and the performance of
this module is shown in Figure 10b–d. The module with reference materials produced
the open circuit voltage of 0.097 V and the maximum output power of
0.028 W when the temperature difference is 300 K (Thot = 400 °C, Tcold =
100 °C). For the module with textured Ca2.95Ag0.05Co3.95Ga0.05O9, the same
temperature difference condition resulted in the open circuit voltage
of 0.1 V and the maximum output power of 0.044 W. The estimated TE
conversion efficiency of the new Ca3Co4O9-based device was 1.38% (∼65% higher than the efficiency
(0.84%) of the normal Ca3Co4O9-based
device). Furthermore, the calculations indicate that output power
of 2.15 W can be obtained for the full size model (50 couples) when
the hot side temperature is 400 °C (Figure 10e).

3 Conclusions
We have demonstrated the
enhancement of TE performance of Ca3Co4O9 via nanoscale texturing and engineered
interfaces with Ag inclusions. This strategy modified the crystal
structure of Ca3Co4O9 and induced
phonon scattering by point defects, leading to lower thermal conductivity.
Codoping and SPS-based synthesis processes were found to be effective
toward improving power factor and ZT values of polycrystalline
Ca3Co4O9. Nanoscale texturing along c-axis provided advantage of higher electrical conductivity
and reduced thermal conductivity in SPS samples. Both nanoscale texturing
along c-axis and inclusions were found to be beneficial
for effective phonon scattering. The lattice thermal conductivity
of doped SPS samples at high temperatures was almost 50% reduced as
compared to undoped SPS material,18 which
led to the improvement in ZT by 50%. The Ag inclusions
also acted as electrical connectors in the matrix increasing electrical
conductivity. Overall, the synergic effect of the crystallographic-textured
Ca3Co4O9 and nanoscale inclusions
resulted in higher electrical conductivity and lower thermal conductivity,
enhancing the TE response (enhanced ZT). The anisotropy
in the transport properties was found to be critical for the TE performance
in commercial applications. We believe that these results will be
helpful in fabrication of high-performance oxide TE materials for
high-temperature applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Preparation
Ca3–xLuxCo4–yGayO9 (x, y = 0, x = 0.05, y = 0.15, and x = 0.15, y = 0.05) and Ca3–x–zAgzLuxCo4–yGayO9 (x = 0–0.05, y = 0–0.05, z = 0–0.05) ceramic
powders were synthesized through a solid-state reaction method. These
powders were sintered through either CS or SPS. A stoichiometric amount
of CaCO3 (99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), Co3O4 (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), AgNO3 (99.9+%, Alfa Aesar), Lu2O3 (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), and Ga2O3 (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) powders was mixed through ball-milling
in ethanol medium for 24 h. The mixture was dried and calcined in
air at 800 °C for 24 h. The calcined powder was further ball-milled
and in order to synthesize single-phase Ca3Co4O9, and the resulting powder was calcined again in air
at 850 °C for 24 h. The calcined Ca3Co4O9 powder was ball-milled again and mixed with a polyvinyl
alcohol binder solution. Next, the mixture was uniaxially pressed
at 1 kpsi followed by CIP at 20 kpsi for 1 min. A binder burn-out
process was performed at 600 °C for 2 h, and Ca3Co4O9 was sintered at 1200 °C for 24 h, then
cooled down to 700 °C before being sintered at 900 °C for
12 h in ambient air. Ca3–x–zAgzLuxCo4–yGayO9 samples (x = 0–0.05, y = 0–0.05, z = 0–0.05) were
conventionally sintered at 900 °C for 12 h in an ambient air.
During the processing, heating and cooling rates were set at a rate
of 1 °C/min.

To improve the TE performance of Ca3Co4O9, SPS processing was carried out for Ca3–xLuxCo4–yGayO9 (x, y = 0, x = 0.05, y = 0.15, and x = 0.15, y = 0.05) and Ca3–x–zAgzLuxCo4–yGayO9 (x = 0–0.05, y = 0–0.05, z = 0–0.05) ceramics.
The samples were heated at 850 °C under a uniaxial pressure of
50 MPa for 5 min. All samples were cut in perpendicular and parallel
directions by the low-speed diamond saw to obtain bar-shaped and disk-shaped
samples for TE measurements. Extreme care was taken to ensure that
all the thermal and electrical measurements are conducted in the same
material direction.

4.2 Material Characterization
Techniques
XRD (Bruker D8 diffractometer) was used to identify
the phases of
the CS and SPS pellets. Microstructures of the samples were analyzed
by FESEM (LEO (Zeiss) 1550 field-emission). The BSE mode in environmental
SEM (FEI Quanta 600 FEG) and EDS (Bruker EDX with a silicon drifted
detector) were used for elemental mapping. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM; FEI Titan 300) was employed to examine the morphology and microstructure
of the sample. XPS (PHI Quantera XSM) was performed using a scanning
monochromatic X-ray source with a highly focused beam (<9 μm)
to identify the chemical states of the samples. The densities of the
samples were measured by Archimedes’ method. The Seebeck coefficient
and the electrical conductivity were measured simultaneously from
100 to 670 °C using a commercial TE measurement system (ULVAC-RIKO
ZEM-3). A bar-shaped sample with dimensions 2.5 mm × 2.5 mm ×
12 mm was used for the measurement in a low-pressure (0.01 MPa) helium
atmosphere. The thermal diffusivity was measured using a laser flash
system (ULVAC-RIKO TC-1200RH). Specific heat was measured with a differential
scanning calorimeter (Netzsch DSC 404C). A disk-shaped sample of 10
mm diameter and 1 mm thickness was used for evaluating thermal conductivity.
The thermal conductivity, κ, was calculated from relation, κ
= αρCp, where
α is thermal diffusivity, ρ is density, and Cp is the specific heat. Hall effect measurements
were performed with the van der Pauw geometry and carrier concentration
(n) was then estimated using the relation VH = BI/nqt, where VH is the Hall voltage, B is the magnetic field, I is the current
across the sample, and t is the sample thickness.
Indium shot was used to make electrodes at the four edges of the top
plane of the sample and annealed at 300 °C for 10 min under nitrogen
flow to enhance the contact between the electrodes and the sample.
The Hall mobility (μH) was calculated from the relation
μH = RHσ, where RH is the Hall coefficient and σ is the
electrical conductivity.
