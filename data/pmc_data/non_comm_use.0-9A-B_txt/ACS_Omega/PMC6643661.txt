The kinetic fragility of a glass-forming
liquid is an important
parameter to describe its molecular mobility. In most polymers, the
kinetic fragility index obtained from the glassy state by thermally
stimulated depolarization current is lower than the one determined
in the liquid-like state by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, as
shown in this work for neat polylactide (PLA). When PLA is plasticized
to different extents, the fragility calculated in the liquid-like
state progressively decreases, until approaching the value of fragility
calculated from the glass, which on the other hand remains constant
with plasticization. Using the cooperative rearranging region (CRR)
concept, it is shown that the decrease of the fragility in the liquid-like
state is concomitant with a decrease of the cooperativity length.
By splitting the fragility calculated in the liquid, in two contributions:
volume and energetic, respectively, dependent and independent on cooperativity,
we observed that the slope of the fragility plot in the glass is equivalent
to the energetic contribution of the fragility in the liquid. It is
then deduced that the difference between the slopes of the relaxation
time dependence calculated in both glass and liquid is an indicator
of the cooperative character of the segmental relaxation when transiting
from liquid to glass. As the main structural consequence of plasticization
lies in the decrease of interchain weak bonds, it is assumed that
these bonds drive the size of the CRR. In contrast, the dynamics in
the glass are independent on plasticization structural effects.

Introduction
The fragility index m (eq 1) introduced
by Angell1 is a physical parameter of glass-forming
liquids, including polymers,
that characterizes the degree of deviation from the Arrhenius-type
temperature dependence of relaxation time, when approaching the glass
transition during cooling. High deviations involve high values of m. The polymer in that case is considered “fragile”.1 In contrast, if the temperature dependence of
the relaxation time τ (T) fits the Arrhenius-type
behavior, the polymer is “strong”.1 1  

The fragility index can be
obtained from the recording of the temperature
dependence of the relaxation time, from dielectric relaxation spectroscopy
(DRS) as an example. The method of thermally stimulated depolarization
current (TSDC) is also successfully used to characterize the large-scale
segmental motions responsible for the glass transition. The fragility
index may be calculated as well from both techniques2 with eq 1.
In TSDC, the sample is placed between parallel electrodes, acting
as a capacitor, and is submitted to a dc electric field at polarization
temperature Tp, which situates generally
slightly above the glass-transition temperature Tg. As a result of the electric field, dipoles reorient
within the polymer. Then, the polarized sample is cooled down, keeping
the electric field applied, to a temperature at which the characteristic
relaxation time is significantly longer. Therefore, when removing
the electric field, the polarization is maintained. The polarized
sample is then reheated, and the electric current produced by the
depolarization process is recorded as a function of time. A peak is
obtained when approaching the glass transition. Alegría et
al.3 showed that the TSDC experiments regarding
the segmental relaxation of polymers can be consistently analyzed
in the same framework often used for conventional DRS experiments,
that is, in terms of the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts (KWW)
equation.4,5 Thus, TSDC and DRS are complementary because
the latter provides the temperature dependence of the relaxation time
in the liquid-like state when the former extends the drawing of the
relaxation map to the glassy state.6 Consequently,
the fragility index calculated from both techniques may differ because
the pathway to the glass transition is different. In this paper, they
are noted as mglass and mliquid when respectively referring to TSDC and DRS data.

Some systems, such as indomethacin,7 diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A,8 pentachloronitrobenzene,9 or glycerol,10 exhibit
close values between mglass and mliquid. In other cases, higher values of mliquid are reported.11−13 Several authors14−16 observed that the discrepancy between fragility values obtained
from various experimental techniques is more pronounced for high-fragility
glass-forming liquids. According to Hutchinson,15 strong glass-forming supercooled liquids are those for
which there is very little change in the slope of the fragility plot
on passing from the equilibrium melt to the nonequilibrium glass,
whereas fragile glass-forming liquids exhibit a large change in the
slope of the fragility plot as the glass-transition region is traversed
on cooling. Arnoult et al.17 investigated
the relaxation dynamics in polylactide (PLA) from both techniques
and reported that mglass = 118 and mliquid = 189. A correlation between mliquid and the molecular structure has been
proposed by Kunal et al.18 and Dudowicz
et al.19 Polymers with very stiff backbones
exhibit high fragility index. As an example, the values of mliquid equal to 132, 156, and 214 for polycarbonate
(PC), poly(ethylene terephthalate), and poly(etherimide), respectively,
were reported.20 On the other hand, polymers
with very flexible backbones, such as polyisobutylene and polyethylene,
for which mliquid is close to 50,20 are among the strongest. However, no clear correlation
has yet been established between the polymer structure and the difference
between mglass and mliquid.

In this study, the impact of PLA plasticization
on its relaxation
map has been investigated. To do so, DRS, TSDC, and modulated temperature
differential scanning experiments (MT-DSCs) have been combined. The
addition of a plasticizer during the formulation of PLA is a common
procedure that lowers its inherent brittleness and decreases its glass-transition
temperature. The structural consequences, when increasing the plasticizer
content, can be anticipated with a simple description, by considering
a minor impact on the macromolecular chain while progressively lowering
the interchain bonding.21−24 Our objective is to investigate how this selective
interchain bond breaking affects the glass-transition dynamics.

Results
and Discussion
Impact of Plasticization on Glass-Transition
Signatures
In Figure 1 are given
the glass-transition signatures obtained for neat and plasticized
PLA from the out-of-phase component C″ of
the complex heat capacity C* obtained by MT-DSC as
a function of temperature (Figure 1a), the depolarization current versus temperature by
TSDC (Figure 1b), and
the imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity in a frequency domain
by DRS (Figure 1c).
As observed from previous MT-DSC reports,25−27 the dynamic
glass-transition temperature determined from the maximum of the C″ peak, Tα MT-DSC, is shifted toward lower temperatures when plasticizer is added
to PLA (Figure 1a).
Similarly, Tα TSDC, the maximum
temperature of the depolarization peak, shifts toward a lower temperature
when the plasticizer content increases (Figure 1b). The segmental relaxation was also investigated
above the glass-transition temperature through DRS. The results are
displayed in Figure 1c at 332 K for each sample. The segmental relaxation (at a fixed
temperature) shifts toward higher frequencies when PLA is plasticized.
This is characteristic of an increase of the molecular mobility with
plasticization. Besides, the α-relaxation temperature Tα DRS, calculated for each sample
(at the relaxation time τ = 100 s), as well as other characteristic
temperatures was reported in Table 1. It decreases with the plasticizer content in consistent
with MT-DSC and TSDC results. Overall, a good agreement is obtained
between these three techniques. In addition, it can be seen in each
inset of Figure 1 that
the width of the glass-transition signature broadens as the plasticizer
content increases from 0 to 13% w/w. Such broadening of the glass
transition when PLA is plasticized by acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC)
has also been reported in previous studies.25−27

Relaxation
Map of Plasticized PLA
The relaxation map
aims at capturing the temperature dependence of the segmental relaxation
dynamics in a temperature domain from either side of calorimetric
glass transition. The segmental relaxation in the liquid-like state
obtained through DRS exhibits a non-Arrhenius character, which can
be described by eq 2 of
Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann (VFT).28−30 2  where τ is the relaxation time corresponding
to the maximum of the relaxation time distribution, τ0 is a pre-exponent factor, D is a steepness parameter,
and T0 is the Vogel temperature. From
TSDC, as proposed by Alegría et al.,31 the segmental relaxation can be consistently analyzed in terms of
the KWW equation.4,5 The relaxation times (τ)
associated with the segmental relaxation were calculated according
to eq 3(3) 3  where Q(t) = ∫t∞I dt, Q0 is the value of the initial stored
charge, I is the intensity, and β is a parameter
depicting the non-Debye character of the segmental relaxation. The
β or βKWW parameter was determined by DRS (see Table 1). Finally, the dynamic
glass-transition temperature obtained from MT-DSC was added for each
sample. MT-DSC measurements were performed with an oscillation period
of 80 s corresponding to a solicitation frequency about 0.0125 Hz,
which provides Tα MT-DSC at a given relaxation time τ equal to 13 s approximately.
The results are presented in Figure 2.

the characteristic relaxation time of
the segmental relaxation as a function of the inverse temperature
obtained from MT-DSC, TSDC, and DRS. Empty symbols correspond to the
DRS results, crossed symbols to the MT-DSC results, and half-filled
symbols to the TSDC results.

The relaxation map highlights the difference in dynamics
for the
segmental relaxation of neat PLA in both glass and liquid states.
When approaching the glass transition on cooling (DRS), the temperature
dependence of the relaxation time strongly deviates from conventional
Arrhenius law (given in eq 4). Instead of a linear dependence, we observe that the relaxation
time increases more rapidly when approaching the glass transition.
Its dependence with temperature was fitted following eq 2. 4  

On the other hand,
TSDC relaxation times exhibit Arrhenius-like
behavior far from the glass transition and a weak curvature close
to the glass transition for every sample. As a consequence, mliquid and mglass calculated according to eq 1 for Tg = Tα (τ = 100 s) are different: mliquid = 152 and mglass =
57. The values for all systems are summarized in Table 1.

With the addition of
plasticizer to PLA, mliquid decreases
from 152 for neat PLA to 87 for PLA/13%. In
contrast, the variation of mglass with
plasticization is not significant: mglass situates between 57 and 70 for all systems. Thus, the high difference
initially observed for neat PLA between the two values is progressively
erased with plasticization.

Cooperativity and Nature of the Glass-Transition
Dynamics
As expected, plasticization shifts the segmental
relaxation to
lower temperatures for a given relaxation time in both glass and liquid.
As shown in Figure 3a, the decrease of the glass-transition temperature follows a linear
trend with the plasticizer weight content. The broadening of the glass-transition
signature with plasticization reveals a wider distribution of temperatures
associated with the segmental relaxation. TSDC and DRS relaxation
time results are supposed to intersect with each other at a given
temperature corresponding to the glass-transition temperature. The
intersection characteristics, in terms of temperature Tg,intersection and relaxation time τintersection, are summarized in Table 1. The relaxation time τ = 100 s (marked in Figure 2) is used as the
reference time for determining the glass-transition temperature. However,
it is observed (Figure 3b) that the intersection point progressively shifts in relaxation
time with plasticization. Although it initially occurs at a relaxation
time equal to 65 s for neat PLA, it deviates down to 5 s for PLA/13%.
Besides, log10[(τ)intersection (s)] follows
a linear trend with the plasticizer weight content (Figure 3b). To assess whether this
result corresponds to a change of dynamics related to plasticization
or to an uncertain determination of τintersection, the activation energy associated with the segmental relaxation
has been calculated thanks to eq 5. 5  where τ is the characteristic
time of
the segmental relaxation at Tα and R is the gas constant. The results are presented in Figure 4 in a normalized
plot Tg,intersection/T. The values of activation energy obtained at Tg,intersection/T = 1 from the liquid Ea,DRS and the glass Ea,TSDC are given in Table 1, as well as ΔEa, the difference
between these two values, also presented in the inset of Figure 4 as a function of
the plasticizer weight content.

content assessed from TSDC, MT-DSC, and DRS measurements. Dashed lines
delimit an experimental domain for the dynamic glass-transition temperature.
(b) Log (relaxation time) vs plasticizer content obtained from the
intersection point between TSDC and DRS results. This variation follows
a linear trend (dashed line).

Figure 4 Activation energy as a function of Tg,intersection/T calculated from TSDC and DRS results. The inset
shows the gap of activation energy at the glass-transition temperature
between both techniques as a function of the plasticizer weight content.
Cross shape points correspond to the activation energy values extrapolated
at Tg,intersection/T =
1.

In the supercooled liquid, for Tg,intersection/T ≤ 0.95,
the activation energy is roughly
the same (about 400 kJ mol–1) independently on the
plasticizer content. When the temperature decreases, the activation
energy increases exponentially for neat PLA until reaching a maximum
value of 932 kJ mol–1 for Tg,intersection/T = 1. The increase of activation
energy during cooling is less and less brutal when increasing the
plasticizer content in PLA and is almost linear versus Tg,intersection/T for PLA/13%. Therefore,
the value of Ea,DRS decreases importantly
with plasticization and reaches its minimum equal to 476 kJ mol–1 for PLA/13%. The activation energy trends obtained
from TSDC are quite different. For low temperatures, the activation
energy versus Tg,intersection/T seems to reach an asymptotic value. Constant values of
activation energy about 100 kJ mol–1 are observed
for neat PLA, PLA/2.5%, and PLA/5% for the lowest temperatures. When
approaching the glass transition, the activation energy increases
until reaching the value Ea,TSDC for Tg,intersection/T = 1. This
change in the molecular dynamics does not compare, however, with what
is observed in the liquid state. The highest value obtained for Ea,TSDC is close to the lowest value obtained
for Ea,DRS. Besides, the variations of Ea,TSDC with the plasticizer content do not follow
a clear trend and might not be significant. An average value about
400 kJ mol–1 might be considered, which is of the
same order as the activation energy in the supercooled liquid, for Tg,intersection/T ≤ 0.95.
As a result, ΔEa decreases with
the ATBC weight percentage following a linear tendency.

It is
worth analyzing these results in the frame of the cooperative
rearranging region (CRR) concept introduced by Adam and Gibbs.32 Many studies associate the so-called viscous
slowing down of supercooled liquids with the increase in the energy
barrier that the structural units must overcome for the relaxation
process to occur.33−36 One can assume that Ea,DRS decreases
with plasticization because of the less cooperative character of the
segmental relaxation dynamics. Adam and Gibbs32 define the CRR as the smallest subsystems in which the main relaxation
process occurs independently of the dynamics of the neighboring subsystems,
so that each region is characterized by its own thermodynamic variables
and relaxation dynamics. The possibility to calculate, ξTα3, the volume
of a CRR from the relaxation temperatures or relaxation time distribution
is suggested by Donth,37 using the thermodynamic
fluctuation approach (eq 6). 6  where Cp is the specific heat capacity
at constant pressure, kB is the Boltzmann’s
constant, Tα is the dynamic glass-transition
temperature,
ρ is the density, and δT is the mean
square temperature fluctuation associated with the glass transition.
From the in-phase and out-of-phase components of the complex heat
capacity measured from MT-DSC, the cooperativity length ξTαMT-DSC has been
calculated. Results are shown in Table 1. By plasticizing PLA, ξTαMT-DSC decreases from 3.3 to 2.0 nm
in consistent with previous observations.25−27 Therefore,
the difference in the liquid-like state between the dynamics of neat
and plasticized PLA can be related to the more or less cooperative
character of the segmental relaxation. On the other hand, no correlation
is found between the cooperativity length and the segmental relaxation
dynamics in the glass that occur similarly independently on the plasticizer
content.

Structural Interpretation of Fragility Dependence on the Dynamic
Nature
Many hypotheses were proposed in the literature to
explain the difference between mliquid and mglass in fragile glass-forming
liquids. It was suggested, for example, that these differences could
be attributed to the nonexponentiality of the segmental relaxation,13,38 so the ratio between fragility values and βKWW would
be equivalent. As shown in Table 1, for the most plasticized system, βKWW = 0.39 while mliquid/mglass is close to 1. Thus, our experimental data do not
fit this assumption. On the other hand, it has been discussed above
that a good correlation is found between ΔEa and ξTαMT-DSC, reflecting the degree of cooperativity associated with the
segmental relaxation in the liquid state. Sokolov et al.39 reported from Raman spectroscopy that strong
glass formers exhibit a high ratio between vibrational and relaxation
contributions in comparison to fragile glass formers. This would imply
that the difference in cooperativity between neat and plasticized
PLA, which reflects in mliquid, has a
structural causality.

Hong et al.40 separated mliquid into two contributions:
the isochoric fragility mV associated
with the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time
at constant volume and the balance (m – mV) that corresponds to the volume contribution.
According to this assumption, mliquid can
be expressed as 7  where κ is the compressibility and αT is the coefficient of thermal expansion of the supercooled
liquid at Tg. The ratio αT/κ goes from 0.5 to 3.0 MPa/K for a wide range of glass formers,
and ΔV# is equal to approximately
5% of the cooperativity volume. Thus, only the parameter (m – mV) is assumed to
be directly correlated with the cooperativity at the glass transition.
By assuming that the difference between mliquid and mglass could be correlated with
the cooperativity length, mV should be
close to mglass. The results presented
in Figure 5a for a
ratio αT/κ = 1.5 MPa/K (an average value with
respect to those reported by Hong et al.40 for different polymers) show indeed a good consistence between the
values of mV and mglass.

Figure 5 (a) mglass and mliquid calculated from TSDC and DRS measurements, respectively,
using eq 1, and isochoric
fragility mV obtained from eq 7. (b) Structural representation
of the two components governing the liquid fragility in neat and plasticized
PLA: (m – mV)
depends on the intermolecular interactions, whereas mV characterizes the stiffness of the backbone. (m – mV) is represented
by dashed arrows in plasticized PLA and by straight arrows in neat
PLA to highlight the respective importance of interchain interactions
in both materials.

Recently,41 we proposed a structural
interpretation of the two components governing the liquid fragility
in polymers. In this representation, (m – mV) depends on the interchain interactions, whereas mV characterizes the stiffness of the backbone.
This interpretation, depicted in Figure 5b, is supported in this study by the progressive
decrease with plasticization of mliquid while keeping mV quite constant. Indeed,
plasticization is expected to interrupt the noncovalent bonding between
the macromolecules without damaging the covalent bonding.21−24 Besides, many authors have evidenced a correlation between the cooperativity
length and the nature and content of interchain interactions. Nakanishi
et al.42 proposed, for example, a simplified
model of hydrogen-bonding network that supports the increase in the
CRR size with intermolecular bonds. Dhotel et al.43 showed that monomers of 11-bromoundecyltrimethoxysilane
organized in self-assembled monolayers exhibit cooperative relaxation
because of the strong interactions between bromoalkyl end groups at
the opposite side of the surface. On the other hand, the decrease
of interchain bonds, such as van der Waals bonds, should decrease
the cooperativity length, as reported when electron–donor and
electron–acceptor side groups are associated in statistical
methacrylate copolymers,44 or when π-stacking
is hindered in PC.45

The additional
role of structure to the segmental relaxation was
already suggested by authors interpreting the change of the slope
of τ (T) at the glass transition on the basis
of the Tool–Narayanaswamy–Moynihan model (eq 8),46−48 in such a way that mglass/mliquid = x, the nonlinearity parameter. 8  where τ0 is the relaxation
time at infinite temperature, Δh* is the apparent
activation energy, and Tf is the fictive
temperature. The first exponential characterizes the temperature dependence,
whereas the second characterizes the structure dependence. Although
contradictory results have been reported13 regarding the equality between the nonlinearity parameter and the
ratio between fragility indexes, this interpretation exhibits common
features with our results. Godard et al.49 reported, for example, that an increase of the distance of separation
of the main chains, similar to the plasticization effect, results
in a decrease of the structural exponential term when the temperature
dependence term remains constant. One may draw a parallel with the
decrease of (m – mV) while keeping mV constant during PLA
plasticization. In the present study, this structural contribution
is specifically attributed to the additional participation of neighboring
structural units to the segmental relaxation thanks to interchain
bonds, that is, the cooperativity increase.

Concluding Remarks
The evolution of activation energy associated with the segmental
relaxation dynamics differs depending on the pathway to the glass
transition. From the glass, the dynamics are initially Arrhenius-like
at low temperature; then, the activation energy progressively increases
during heating. In the liquid-like state, the possibility that the
segmental relaxation mobilizes a higher number of structural units
exists. The consequence of such an increase of the cooperativity during
cooling is that the activation energy also increases toward the glass
transition in higher proportions compared to what is observed in the
glassy state. This leads to calculate significantly higher fragility
index in the liquid from DRS than in the glass from TSDC. The specific
structural modification generated by plasticization on PLA, that is,
the selective breaking of noncovalent bonds, allows reducing the volume
contribution to the liquid fragility without impacting the energetic
contribution. As an illustration of the important role played by the
interchain cooperativity in the viscous slowing down, this procedure
erases the difference between fragility indexes calculated from the
glass and the liquid. It is worth mentioning that the conclusions
drawn in this paper should be accurate for any system series in which
the changes in the molecular dynamics are mostly caused by any modification
of the interchain interactions.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Sample Preparation
Sample preparation
procedure has been explained in Delpouve et al.27 PLA 4042D (about 96% of l-lactide and 4% of d-lactide) was provided by NatureWorks. ATBC (CAS number 77-90-7)
was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (France). PLA and ATBC were dried
at 80 °C under vacuum for 12 h before blending in an internal
mixer (Haake Rheocord 9000) at 160 °C and 60 rpm for 15 min.
The materials were dried (4 h at 80 °C under vacuum), thermo-molded
between two hot plates under 10 bars for 2 min, and then quenched
to room temperature. Plasticized PLA samples were named PLA/x % ATBC films, with the weight percentage of plasticizer x varying between 2.5 and 13 (0; 2.5; 5; 9; 13%). The average
molecular weight of the PLA (Mn = 90 500
g·mol–1 with dispersity = 2.75) was estimated
from size exclusion chromatography. The stability of ATBC into PLA
was investigated and it was proved by Dobircau et al.25 that, after several thermal cycles around the glass transition,
ATBC does not exude from PLA. All samples were kept amorphous during
this study.

Modulated Temperature Differential Scanning
Calorimetry
MT-DSC measurements were carried out by DSC Q100
(TA instruments)
under nitrogen atmosphere. The samples (about 10 mg) were put into
hermetic aluminum pans (T-Zero, TA Instruments). The calibration was
carried in three steps using standards of indium and benzophenone
for temperature calibration, indium for energy calibration, and sapphire
for heat capacity calibration. Experiments were performed under nitrogen
atmosphere (70 mL min–1) with an oscillation amplitude A = ±1.5 K, a period p = 80 s, and
a heating rate βh = 1 K min–1.
These conditions correspond to the heat cool mode, which is recommended
for a clear analysis of the glass transition from which the dynamic
glass-transition temperature Tα MT-DSC is determined. The modulation step number was estimated to be higher
than 5 during the glass transition. The complete deconvolution procedure
was done as described by Lacey et al.50 and the phase angle correction as proposed by Weyer et al.51 Before MT-DSC measurement, the samples were
heated at βh = 10 K min–1 up to
a temperature just above the glass-transition range and then cooled
at |βc| = βh = 10 K min–1 down to 0 °C in order to rejuvenate the sample.

Dielectric
Relaxation Spectroscopy
Dielectric spectroscopy
measurements were performed on 30 mm diameter and 200 μm thickness
samples by means of DRS with a broadband frequency response analyzer
(Alpha Analyzer, Novocontrol Technologies). The temperature was controlled
with a Novocontrol Quatro system. Dielectric loss measurements were
acquired every 1 °C around the glass-transition range, that is,
from Tα MT-DSC –
5 °C to Tα MT-DSC + 20 °C and over a broad frequency window from 10–1 to 106 Hz. To analyze the dielectric relaxation curves,
Havriliak–Negami complex function with a conductivity term
was used.52 9  where ω is
the angular pulsation, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity,
σ is the conductivity,
and n is a fitting parameter related to the slope
of the conductivity. Δε = εs –
ε∞ is the relaxation strength where εs is the static permittivity (low frequency) and ε∞ is the permittivity at high frequency, τ is
the relaxation time, α and β are the broadening and asymmetry
factors, respectively, and k is the number of contributions
needed to fit correctly the experimental data. The procedure to extract
βKWW is given in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).

The temperature was controlled with a Novocontrol Quatro system. The
samples were polarized in the liquid state at a temperature Tp = Tα MT-DSC + 3 °C with a direct current of 5 × 105 V m–1 for 5 min. The procedure for selecting the polarization
temperature is given in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). It is based on obtaining the best compromise between
observing the global response of the material (well-resolved peak)
and also on getting rid of parasite signatures such as conductivity
contributions. The samples were cooled down rapidly at Tα MT-DSC – 40 °C while keeping
the applied direct current to ensure the dipole orientation. Depolarization
currents were then recorded from Tα MT-DSC – 40 °C to Tα MT-DSC + 15 °C with a linear temperature ramp of 10 K min–1. The TSDC experiments were performed just after cooling to minimize
the physical aging effects that can strongly impact the mobility in
glass and therefore the experimental results.6,14,17,53
