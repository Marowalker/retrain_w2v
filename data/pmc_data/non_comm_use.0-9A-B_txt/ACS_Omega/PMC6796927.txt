In
a preliminary screening, the methanol extract of Cinnamomum
tamala leaves was found to inhibit the
swarming motility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bioassay-guided fractionation by silica gel column chromatography
led to the identification of cinnamtannin B1 (1) as one
of the active components of the extract. It inhibited the swarming
motility (at 12.5 μg/mL) and biofilm formation (at 25 μg/mL)
ofP. aeruginosa. Comparative gene expression
analysis revealed downregulation of rhlA and fliC genes upon treatment with the tannin. The tannin may
be affecting rhamnolipid and flagellin production. Thus, cinnamtannin
B1 is an active component of C. tamala responsible for inhibiting the swarming motility of P. aeruginosa.

Introduction
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa is a gram-negative
opportunistic pathogen responsible for numerous hospital acquired
infections. It can infect a wide range of hosts including worms, plants,
animals, and humans. In humans, it causes different infections in
immunocompromised conditions. This is made possible because of the
production of numerous virulence factors which facilitate the infection
process. An important virulence property of P. aeruginosa is its motility. According to the environmental condition, it adapts
to any of the three major kinds of motilities, namely, swimming, swarming,
or twitching. Of these, swarming is a social behavior, enabling dissemination
of bacteria over surfaces, and is regulated by quorum sensing regulatory
circuits.1 Nutrient limitation in medium
triggered swarming motility, resulting in the hypothesis that it is
an adaptation by bacteria to migrate to nutrient-rich regions.2 It is also implicated in niche colonization prior
to biofilm formation. Swarming bacteria are also known to be resistant
to antibiotics and overexpress virulence factors.3 Swarming has also been shown to have positive correlation
to the clinical pathogenesis of ocular keratitis.4 However, the factors inducing or suppressing swarming motility
are not yet fully known. Thus, studying compounds inhibiting swarming
motility offers an opportunity to get an insight into the mechanism,
regulating this complex process.

Many plant-derived compounds
are known to inhibit swarming motility
and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. The most notable among them are citrus flavonoids such as naringenin,5,6 tannins such as cranberry proanthocyanidins (PACs),7 and green tea polyphenols.8 In
a preliminary study involving different plant extracts to identify
inhibitors of swarming motility of P. aeruginosa, we found that the methanol extract of leaves of Cinnamomum tamala T. Nees and Eberm inhibited swarming
motility at 5 μg/mL.9 In order to
find out the active component responsible for this inhibition, we
carried out bioassay-guided purification of the active compound from
the extract and attempted to study its possible mechanism of action.
Here, we report the identification of cinnamtannin B1 as one of the
active components of the extract and its effect on the expression
of genes associated with swarming motility.

Results and Discussion
Bioassay-Guided
Purification of the Active Component
The active methanol
extract of C. tamala (CtM) was subjected
to silica gel column chromatography using chloroform,
ethyl acetate, and methanol gradients. Bioassay of the resulting fractions
revealed fraction F13 to be more active (Figure S1). F13 was further purified by successive fractionations
on silica column using ethyl acetate and methanol (9:1 to 1:1) as
eluting solvents, yielding compound (1). Subsequent bioassay
of the subfractions revealed the subfraction F13.3 and 1 to be active (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Swarm assay of subfractions F13.3 and 1 on the swarming
motility of P. aeruginosa. (A)—DMSO
control; (B)—F13.3 at 25 μg/mL; (C)—F13.3 at 6.25
μg/mL; (D)—F13.3 at 3.125 μg/mL; (E)—1 at 12. 5 μg/mL; (F)—1 at 6.25
μg/mL; (G)—1 at 3.125 μg/mL.

The subfraction F13.3 inhibited swarming at 3.125
μg/mL,
while 1 inhibited swarming at 12.5 μg/mL (Figure 1). The activity was
comparable to that of catechin, which inhibited swarming motility
at 10 μg/mL in our previous screening9 study. A thin-layer chromatogram analysis of F13.3 and 1 (F13.4 in Figure 2) revealed that F13.3 contained two closely located bands, while 1 contained the lower band of the two (Figure 2). A comparison of the subfractions with
the compounds catechin and quercetin, both of which are reported to
be present in the plant, revealed that the active compound was different
from these two compounds (Figure 2). The Rf values for catechin and quercetin were 0.872 and 0.909, respectively.
The Rf values for F13.3
a (lower band; Figure 2), F13.3 b (upper band; Figure 2), and 1 (Figure 2) subfractions were 0.5454, 0.6363, and 0.5636,
respectively. The retention factors of F13.3 a (lower band) and 1 were similar, indicating that they were the same compound.

Comparing the proton and carbon NMR and mass spectroscopy
data
to available literature,101 was identified as cinnamtannin B1 (Text S1, Figures S1–S5).

Biofilm Assay
Biofilm formation is one of the key characteristics
of P. aeruginosa, involving formation
of an extracellular matrix containing polysaccharides, rhamnolipids,
and extracellular DNA. Several natural compounds are known to interrupt
the formation of biofilm, including furanone C-3011 and malabaricone C.12 We analyzed
the effect of 1 on biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa. When viewed by a scanning electron
microscope, it was observed that the treated cells were more dispersed
and lacked the interconnecting matrix when compared to untreated control
biofilm (Figure 3).
When checked for its effect on growth, 1 did not inhibit
the growth of the bacterium (Figure S2),
indicating that the inhibition on swarming and biofilm was specific
to these pathways and not because of growth inhibition.

microscope. (A)—biofilm formed by P. aeruginosa and (B)—dispersal of bacterial cells after treatment with 1.

Comparative Gene Expression
Analysis of Swarm-Deficient and
Proficient P. aeruginosa
In
order to find the possible pathways affected by the active compound,
we performed a comparison of gene expression levels between nonswarming,
compound-treated bacteria and actively swarming untreated bacteria
by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR). Gene expression analysis
of swarm-deficient P. aeruginosa treated
with 1 showed a downregulation of rhlA and fliC genes when compared to swarming competent
bacteria (Figure 4),
whereas no significant change in the extracellular polysaccharide
genes pelA and psl was observed. rhlA and fliC genes encode proteins responsible
for the synthesis of rhamnolipids and flagella protein flagellin,
respectively. Rhamnolipids are known to contribute to swarming motility
by acting as biosurfactants that reduce the surface tension over semisolid
medium, facilitating rapid movement along the surface.13 Another requirement for efficient swarming motility
is the presence of functional flagella. In many bacteria, swarming
is associated with cellular changes including cell elongation and
hyperflagellation.1 In P.
aeruginosa, actively swarming cells were reported
to be twice as long as the cells at the center and consisted of bipolar
flagella.14P. aeruginosa mutants of rhlA and fliC genes
are reported to be deficient in swarming.13,14 A previous study using pomegranate tannins showed repression of
flagellin production and motility in Escherichia coli.15 Similarly, different tannins from
cranberry, pomegranate, and green tea inhibited the swarming motility
of P. aeruginosa, and it was partially
restored by exogenous addition of rhamnolipids to the medium, indicating
a role in rhamnolipid production.7 The
authors also proposed that the tannins could be interacting with flagellin.16 However, studies on the effect of cinnamtannins
on swarming motility have not been reported. The previous literature
data on other tannins correlate with our observation of downregulation
of rhamnolipid and flagellin genes upon treatment with cinnamtannin.
Analysis of additional regulatory genes may reveal a clearer insight
into the target of action.

Figure 4 Comparative expression levels of different genes
of P. aeruginosa upon treatment with 1 with
that of untreated cells. The graph represents expression ratios in
the log10 scale. The graph represents average values of
two independent experiments performed in triplicates with SD. *Values
are significantly different when compared to untreated control (P value < 0.001).

C. tamala is reported to contain
several tannins in addition to other flavonoids and eugenol.17−19 The major among them are the A-type PACs also known as cinnamtannins.10,20 Cinnamtannin B1 was isolated among other tannins from the bark of C. tamala and was found to contain immunosuppressive
effects on splenocytes.10 PACs from cranberry
fruit juice have been known to interfere with the adhesion of gram-negative
bacteria, especially E. coli.21−23 A detailed report on tannins inhibiting virulence properties of
bacteria is covered in the exhaustive review by Silva et al.24 Other studies revealed that tannins from cranberry,
pomegranate, and green tea blocked swarming without affecting swimming
or twitching.7,16 In another study, tannins from
the plant Anadenanthera colubrine were
found to be responsible for reduction in biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa.

Thus, our study has shown that
cinnamtannin B1 from C. tamala is able
to inhibit swarming motility and
biofilm matrix formation by P. aeruginosa. Rhamnolipid and flagellar gene expression was lowered by the tannin
based on RT PCR data. However, other possible mechanisms may also
be responsible for the observed effect.

Experimental Section
General
Experimental Procedures
NMR spectra of the
sample were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE II 400 MHz NMR spectrometer
using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. High-resolution electron
ionization mass spectrometry (HR EI-MS) spectra were recorded on an
Agilent (Santa Clara, USA) 6530 Accurate Mass Q-TOF LC/MS system.
Mobile phase used was water with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile
(1:1) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Peaks were recorded in positive
mode, and Agilent mass hunter workstation software was used for data
analysis. Purity of the sample was analyzed by reverse phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Shimadzu, Japan). Compound 1 was dissolved in HPLC grade acetonitrile. From this, 20 μL
of volume was injected to a RP-Capcell C18 MG II column (250 mm ×
4.6 mm) with a particle size of 5 μm. The sample was run in
an increasing gradient of acetonitrile (solvent B) in water (solvent
A), starting from 0 to 80% B. The oven temperature was maintained
at 30 °C, and sample detection was carried out using the photodiode
array detector at 280 and 254 nm.

Plant Material
Dried leaves of C. tamala T. Nees
and Eberm were bought from the local market in Pondicherry.
The samples were identified by Professor N. Parthasarathy, Department
of Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Pondicherry University. Specimens
of the samples were deposited in the Department of Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology, Pondicherry University [Voucher Specimen Number C. tamala (PUBMB 01)].

Extraction and Isolation
Approximately 90 g of powdered C. tamala leaves was sequentially extracted with
1800 mL of hexane, chloroform,
and methanol. All the extracts were taken in separate round-bottomed
glass flasks and were evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator
(Buchi, Switzerland). The concentrated extracts were collected and
stored in air-tight containers. From the methanol extract thus obtained,
2.4 g of extract was mixed with 230–400 silica, dried to a
free flowing powder, and was loaded evenly onto a silica column (230–400
mesh size, Merck). The column was eluted using increasing gradients
of chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol, starting from 100% chloroform
to 100% ethyl acetate and 100% methanol. The column was finally washed
with methanol/water (80:20). The eluted fractions were analyzed by
thin-layer chromatography using the solvent systems: (i) chloroform/ethyl
acetate/methanol (8:3:2) or (ii) ethyl acetate/methanol/water (10:1.65:1.35).
Similar fractions were pooled together, and each pooled fraction was
analyzed for swarming motility inhibition. The active F13 fraction
(161 mg) was again fractionated through silica column (230–400
mesh) using ethyl acetate (from 100%) and gradually increasing gradient
of methanol (till ethyl acetate/methanol 40:60) to yield F13.3. Subsequent
column chromatography of F13.3 (14 mg) using ethyl acetate/methanol
yielded 1 (18 mg).

The purity of 1 was analyzed by analytical reverse phase HPLC as described in General Experimental Procedures.

Swarming Motility
Assay
The swarming motility assay
for P. aeruginosa was performed using
the column fractions (at a concentration of 200 μg/mL each)
or the compound. The fractions or the compound dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) to make stock solutions were added to 3 mL of molten
swarm agar to the required concentrations and poured in Petriplates
(60 × 15 mm). After solidification, 3 μL of overnight grown P. aeruginosa culture was inoculated in the center
of the swarm plates. Two control plates were kept for the comparison
of results, one containing swarm medium and the other containing DMSO
with the medium. All the plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight.

To confirm the effect on swarming, the disk assay was performed
using the fractions at a concentration of 200 μg/mL each. Five
milliliters of the swarm agar media was poured in sterile plates and
was allowed to set. After solidification, 5 μL of overnight
grown P. aeruginosa culture was inoculated
at the center of the plates. Sterile disks loaded with the required
concentration of fractions and dried were placed on the agar a few
millimeters away from the culture. A control disk was loaded with
DMSO for comparison of the effect of the solvent. All the plates were
incubated at 37 °C overnight.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM) of Biofilm Formation
Biofilm assay was performed in
a 12-well plate. Each well consisted
of 1 mL of LB broth containing 1 at a concentration of
25 μg/mL. To the wells, 1 mL of 1/100 diluted overnight P. aeruginosa culture was added. Untreated control
constituted 1 mL of LB broth and 1 mL of 1/100 diluted overnight culture
of P. aeruginosa. The plate was incubated
at 37 °C overnight. The coverslips were removed from the wells
and were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fixation of
the cover slips was done using 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution and osmium
tetroxide and washed subsequently with PBS and water. The samples
were dehydrated in a series of ethanol, dried, and analyzed by SEM
at 10 kV at a magnification of 5 and 1 μm.

RT PCR Analysis
Total RNA was isolated from nonswarming
cells and swarming cells taken from 1-treated and untreated
swarm agar plates. RNA isolation was done following the protocol of
HiPurA Total RNA Isolation Kit from HiMedia (HiMedia, India). Dnase
treatment was given to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. The quality
and quantity of RNA were assessed by both agarose gel electrophoresis
and nanodrop. cDNA was prepared using the Reverse Transcriptase Kit
from Genei, Bangalore, India, using 600 ng of RNA of each sample.
Comparative gene expression levels of the genes pelA, psl, rhlA, and fliC were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Reactions
were performed using KAPA SYBR Fast Universal master mix from Sigma
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and program was
run in Roche LightCycler 96. The program consisted of a preincubation
at 95 °C for 600 s, followed by 45 cycles of a three-step amplification
cycle at 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C
for 10 s. After the reaction, the results were analyzed by the 2–ΔΔCt method.25 Expression levels were normalized against that of the rpoD constitutive gene.
