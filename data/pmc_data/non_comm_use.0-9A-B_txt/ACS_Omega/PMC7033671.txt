Ponatinib is a multikinase inhibitor
that is used to treat chronic
myeloid leukemia patients harboring mutated ABL1(T315I) kinase. Due
to the potent inhibition of FLT3, RET, and fibroblast growth factor
receptors (FGFRs), it is also being evaluated against acute myeloid
leukemia (AML), biliary, and lung cancers. The multikinase inhibition
profile of ponatinib may also account for its toxicity, thus analogs
with improved kinase selectivity or different kinase inhibition profiles
could be better tolerated. The introduction of nitrogen into drug
compounds can enhance efficacy and drug properties (a concept called
“necessary nitrogen”). Here, we introduce additional
nitrogen into the benzamide moiety of ponatinib to arrive at nicotinamide
analogs. A nicotinamide analogue of ponatinib, HSN748, retains activity
against FLT3, ABL1, RET, and PDGFRα/β but loses activity
against c-Src and P38α. MNK1 and 2 are key kinases that phosphorylate
eIF4E to regulate the protein translation complex. MNK also modulates
mTORC1 signaling and contributes to rapamycin resistance. Inhibitors
of MNK1 and 2 are being evaluated for anticancer therapy. Ponatinib
is not a potent inhibitor of MNK1 or 2, but the nicotinamide analogs
are potent inhibitors of MNKs. This illustrates a powerful demonstration
of the necessary nitrogen concept to alter both the potency and selectivity
of drugs.

==== Body
Introduction
Ponatinib, developed
by Ariad Pharmaceuticals as a multikinase
inhibitor, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
in 2012.1 It targets many of the various
cancer-driver kinases. These include kinases such as ABL1, FLT3, FGFR1-4,
and RET. Due to its impressive kinase inhibition profile, it has been
shown to potently inhibit various cancers, including chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), various fibroblast growth
factor receptor (FGFR)- and RET-driven cancers (such as nonsmall cell
lung cancer2 and thyroid cancer3). Currently, ponatinib is the only FDA-approved
drug for imatinib-resistant CML that harbors the T315I mutation.4 It is also undergoing various clinical trials
for AML, lung, and other cancers (NCT02428543; ponatinib for FLT3-ITD
acute myelogenous leukemia (PONATINIB-AML),5 NCT02265341; advanced biliary cancer with FGFR2 fusions,6 NCT01813734; ponatinib in advanced NSCLC with
RET translocations7).

Despite these
impressive arrays of cancer types that ponatinib
is currently being evaluated against, the drug is relatively toxic
and is associated with cardiovascular adverse events.8 Patients taking ponatinib have also shown side effects
of hypertension, platelet dysfunction, and peripheral arterial occlusive
disease.9 Other more serious side effects
such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and liver failure have occurred
in patients taking ponatinib.10 The unfavorable
toxicity profile associated with ponatinib could be due to the simultaneous
inhibition of cardiovascular-related kinases.11 Herein, we disclose that a nicotinamide analogue of ponatinib (HSN748),
whereby the benzamide moiety in ponatinib is replaced with a nicotinamide
analog, shows a different kinase inhibition profile to ponatinib.
Additionally, the nicotinamide analogue of ponatinib is a better inhibitor
of AML cell lines harboring secondary mutations, such as FLT3-ITD,
D835Y and FLT3-ITD, F691L, which appear upon prolonged treatment with
other FLT3 inhibitors and lead to drug resistance.12

Results and Discussion
Necessary Nitrogen, a High-Level Medicinal
Chemistry Design
Strategy
The substitution of a −CH group in a hit
compound with a N atom in aromatic and heteroaromatic ring systems
is a small modification but has potentially large effects on pharmacological
profiles. This is due to large changes in molecular and physicochemical
properties and intra- and intermolecular interactions. The methyl
group scanning is also a high-level medicinal chemistry design strategy,
and this has been extensively reviewed.13 Whereas the −CH to −Me or −Me to −CH
switch is not accompanied by a big desolvation penalty, a −CH
to N switch is accompanied by a large desolvation penalty.14 Despite this penalty, the strategic placement
of nitrogen into compounds can lead to dramatic improvement in both
potency and drug properties and this has been extensively documented
(Figure 1).15−17 A ring nitrogen can form new and stabilizing hydrogen bonding interactions
with protein residues, backbone or even form network interactions
with water molecules that interact with the protein’s residues
or backbone. For a few illustrative examples, Vanotti et al. revealed
that a strategic replacement of a phenyl group with a 4-pyridyl group
in a cell division cycle 7 (Cdc7) kinase inhibitor improved biochemical
activity by >500-fold (compounds 1 to 2, Figure 1). This
large effect
was attributed to “necessary nitrogen” in the 4-pyridyl
substitution making a key hydrogen bonding interaction with the protein
backbone (Figure 1a).15

Figure 1 Examples of the necessary nitrogen concept. Introduction
of nitrogen
into initial hits led to remarkable activity enhancement as seen in
(A) cell division cycle 7 (Cdc7) kinase inhibitors; (B) 5-HT3AR inhibitors; and (C) PLK1 inhibitors.

Esch et al. performed a N-scan on the isoquinoline 5-HT3AR inhibitor 3 (Figure 1b), with pKi = 6.7, and
arrived at the quinazoline 4 (Figure 1b) with pKi =
10 against 5-HT3AR (4300-fold enhancement).16 The newly installed N atom was not predicted
to engage in any favorable electrostatic interactions for the ligand
docking pose in a homology model of the 5-HT3AR binding
site (acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP)) yet compound 4 is greater than 2 orders of magnitude more potent than 3. Recently, Remillard et al. showed that the replacement of CH in
compound 5 to N in compound 6 increased
PLK1 binding (Figure 1c).17

These examples and others
prompted us to perform a “nitrogen
scan” on ponatinib as well as remove the methyl group on the
benzamide core of ponatinib and test the analogs (Figure 2) for inhibition against various
kinases and cancers.

analogs.

Synthesis of Ponatinib
Analogs
HSN748 and other analogs
(Figure 2) were synthesized
in two linear steps from 5-ethynylnicotinic acid (Figure 3).18−22 By introducing a nitrogen into the benzamide ring
(to make a nicotinamide), the calculated log P changed from 4.29 (ponatinib) to 3.62 (HSL420). Removing the methyl
group on HSL420 reduced the c log P even further to 3.23 (HSN748).23 The ranking of log P values can be derived
from retention times of compounds on C18 columns.24 In concordance with the calculated log P values, the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) retention
times of the analogs showed corresponding trends (Table 1).

Anticancer
Activities of Nicotinamide Analogs and Ponatinib
With compounds
in hand, we proceeded to evaluate the effects of
compounds on CML cell lines as well as FLT3, ABL1, and c-Src kinases,
which are known to be targets of ponatinib.25 Although ponatinib is not an effective inhibitor of MAPK-interacting
kinases (MNK1 and 2), we also evaluated the inhibition of the compounds
on MNK1 and MNK2. An unrelated project, using alkynyl nicotinamide
compounds, had taught us that alkynyl nicotinamide-containing compounds
were MNK2 inhibitors (unpublished work), prompting us to also evaluate
the inhibition of ponatinib analogs against MNK enzymes. The mechanistic
target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an important drug target as mTOR integrates
many stimuli and coordinates the adaptive response of many cellular
processes.26 Rapamycin is an inhibitor
of mTOR. MNK contributes to rapamycin resistance by sustaining mTORC1
activity upon rapamycin treatment in cancer cells.26 MNKs modulate mTORC1 but not mTORC2 (which includes Rictor,
rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) signaling.27,28 Thus, concurrent inhibition of MNK1 and/or MNK2 and any of cancer-driver
kinases, such as FLT3, ABL1, RET, BRAF, c-Kit, PDGFRα, and PDGFRβ,
could lead to more sustained inhibition of cancer growth. MNK1 and
2 modulate the function of eIF4E (a key player in translational control),
which is elevated in human cancers. MNK1 and 2 phosphorylate a conserved
serine (Ser209) of eIF4E to modulate function. The inhibition of both
MNK1 and 2 has been shown to lead to growth inhibition in cancers.26

With ponatinib as the standard of care
for imatinib-resistant CML harboring ABL1(T315I), we were initially
interested in how our compounds compared in the imatinib-resistant
CML line, KCL22-IR. The compounds were active against the BCR-ABL1
cell lines, K562 and KCL22, with varying activities against KCL22-IR.
Removing the methyl and substituting CH with N on the benzamide ring
(ponatinib to HSN748) did not affect anticancer properties against
the tested CML cell lines. In addition, reversing the amide bond in
HSN748 (HSL338) did not result in a change in anticancer activity.
Modification of the imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine moiety
resulted in attenuation of CML growth inhibition. Ponatinib, HSN748,
HSL338, and HSL420 all share the imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine
ring system, and they all inhibited the CML cell lines K562, KCL22,
and KCL22-IR with similar efficacies (Table 2). However, when the imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine was changed into imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (HSL381) or imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine (HSL385),
there was a decrease in potency against the CML cell lines with the
biggest difference seen in KCL22-IR. The imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine-containing compound (HSL382) was inactive against all
of the three tested cell lines. Interestingly, when the ring system
was changed to imidazol[1,2-a]pyrazine (HSL407),
activities against K562 and KCL22 were maintained, but a decrease
in activity against KCL22-IR was seen.

Compounds Exhibited Potent
Inhibition against Key Kinases
Similar trends that were present
against the cell lines were also
seen when the compounds were profiled against several kinases. Ponatinib
had less than 40% inhibition against FLT3(ITD) at 4 nM. However, several
of the nicotinamide compounds had inhibition at over 80% such as HSN748
(86%), HSL381 (91%), and HSL338 (84%) at the same concentration. There
was also an increase in FLT3(D835Y) inhibition in compounds containing
the nicotinamide. Ponatinib had a 39% inhibition against FLT3(D835Y).
When the nitrogen was added to make a nicotinamide ring (HSL420),
there was no significant change in inhibition. When the methyl was
then removed (HSN748), FLT3(D835Y) inhibition increased to 87%. This
shows that even small modifications to a kinase inhibitor can result
in drastic changes in kinase profiling. Inhibition of c-Src saw the
opposite effect. At 111 nM, ponatinib had a 98% inhibition against
c-Src. The methyl nicotinamide analogue (HSL420) inhibited c-Src at
32%, whereas HSN748 had less than 10% inhibition. For ABL1(T315I)
inhibition, it appears that a benzamide to nicotinamide switch had
no effect on inhibition. At 123 nM, both HSL420 and ponatinib had
similar inhibition against ABL1 (T315I) at 83 and 90%, respectively.
Analogs that contained the imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine
(ponatinib, HSN748, HSL338, and HSL420) system were generally more
potent than analogs that did not against ABL1(T315I). Interestingly,
when the imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine was substituted
with imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (HSL381), potency against
ABL1(T315I) was maintained at 73%. The compounds had differential
activities against MNKs. At 123 nM, ponatinib inhibited MNK2 at 32%,
whereas HSN420 and HSN748 inhibited MNK2 at 51 and 85%, respectively.
MNK2 inhibition could tolerate minimal changes to the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine as seen in HSL381 (imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine, 84% inhibition) and HSL385 (imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine, 72% inhibition).

Ponatinib is a More Promiscuous Kinase Inhibitor
than HSN748
The initial work with ponatinib analogs indicated
that HSN748 and
HSL381 had the best-combined ABL1, FLT3, and MNK2 inhibitions. HSN748
was chosen for further studies because it had a lower c log P and HPLC retention time than
HSL381 (see Table 1). Therefore, we obtained IC50 for ponatinib and HSN748
against various cancer-associated kinases (Table 3). Interestingly, as already established
in the single concentration assay (Figure 4), the inhibition profiles of HSN748 against
ABL1 (T315I) and FLT3-ITD were similar to ponatinib, but there were
some notable differences with other kinases (Table 3).

(IC50 = 55.5
± 47.3) was used as the control for P38a/MAPK14.

HSN748 was inactive against c-Src
kinase (IC50 > 1 μM),
while ponatinib potently inhibited c-Src (IC50 of 4.6 nM),
(Table 3). Src has
been shown to play various roles in the heart function. For example,
Src plays critical roles in maintaining the structure of a myocyte.29 Despite the oncogenic role played by Src in
various cancers, its inhibition could also come with the dysregulation
of normal cells and platelets.30a It is
therefore noteworthy that HSN748 does not inhibit Src, while ponatinib
does. c-Kit is an important player in hematopoiesis, and substantial
inhibition of c-kit causes myelosuppression.30b The IC50 for ponatinib against c-Kit is 3 times lower
than HSN748.

Ponatinib has been shown to inhibit FGFRs, and
it is currently
undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of biliary cancer with
FGFR2 fusion.7 Although many drugs that
target FGFRs are currently undergoing clinical trials, FGFRs have
important cardiac and liver functions and so their inhibitions could
lead to adverse events. Hyperphosphatemia is one major complication
that is associated with FGFR inhibition due to interruption to FGF23
signaling.31 Pan-FGFR inhibition has been
linked to cardiovascular dysfunction.32 On the other hand, FGFR signaling also promotes AML resistance to
drugs.33 Thus, some inhibition of FGFR
signaling might enhance the efficacy of AML therapeutics. Ponatinib
is slightly more active against FGFR1-4 than HSN748 (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Dose–response curves of ponatinib and
HSN748 against Src
and FLT3 (D835Y).

ABL1 and FLT3 are mutated
in CML and AML, respectively. Ponatinib
and HSN748 have similar activities against ABL1, ABL1 (T315I), and
FLT3-ITD. Interestingly, HSN748 has a significantly lower IC50 against FLT3 (D835Y) kinase than ponatinib (compare IC50 of 14 nM for HSN748 versus 173 nM for ponatinib, see Table 1 and Figure 3). Most FLT3 inhibitors used in the clinic
show initial efficacy, but within months some patients relapse due
to kinase mutation, which reduces the efficacy of treatment.34 The D835Y mutation is one of the most frequent
mutations observed in a study using the TKI quizartinib.35 Thus, for drug-resistant AML (due to kinase
mutation), HSN748 could be a better treatment option than ponatinib
(Table 4).

It is interesting that a −CH to −N switch
in the
benzamide of ponatinib can lead to such dramatic kinase selectivities
and potencies. Analyses of the crystal structures of ponatinib bound
to several kinases (Figure 6) did not reveal an obvious hydrogen bonding interaction between
the introduced nitrogen and the active site residue, which would enhance
binding. We however do not discount a role for an uncharacterized
active site water molecule to mediate such interactions. In a beautiful
work by Boxer et al., it was shown that the cyano moiety in bosutinib
is engaged in the water-mediated hydrogen network.36 Future work, which solves the crystal structures of target
kinases bound to HSN748, will help clarify how the nicotinamide nitrogen
enhances binding.

We proceeded to test whether the degree of inhibition
of FLT3,
ABL1, RET, and FGFR-driven cancers by ponatinib and HSN748 mirrored
the order of kinase inhibition. The IC50 for growth inhibition
by both compounds against MV-4-11 (FLT3), K562 (ABL1), and LC2/ad
(RET) was similar. HSN748 was better at inhibiting quizartinib-resistant
AML (MOLM14-D835Y cell line) than ponatinib (compare IC50 of 0.69 nM for HSN748 and 52.6 nM for ponatinib). For the gilteritinib-resistant
AML cell line, Molm14 (ITD, F691L), HSN748 was also more potent than
ponatinib (IC50 of 0.18 nM for HSN748 and 6.8 nM for ponatinib).

Conclusions
We have shown that the replacement of the benzamide
moiety of ponatinib
with nicotinamide results in enhanced activity against drug-resistant
AML, while reducing the inhibition of off-target kinases, such as
Src, Kit, and FGFRs. HSN748 is a lead compound that warrants further
consideration as an antileukemia compound, with a potentially less
toxic profile than ponatinib. We are aware that idiosyncratic toxicities
in real patient populations cannot be predicted based on in vitro
kinase selectivity alone. Nonetheless, the fact that some level of
kinase selectivity has been achieved is in the right direction toward
a safer ponatinib analog. Ongoing work will conduct further preclinical
toxicity experiments on this new ponatinib analog, with an eye toward
clinical translation.

Experimental Section
Solvents and
starting materials were purchased from commercial
sources and used without further purifications.

General Cell Culture Procedure
The human cell lines
were cultured using RPMI-1640 (Gibco), supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals), 1% glutaMAX, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Cells were seeded with 2 × 103 cells in each well
of a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then treated
for 72 h with serial dilutions of the desired compound. After the
72 h, cells were treated with the CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability Assay.
The cells were then incubated for 3 h, and absorbance at 570 nm was
measured using a microplate reader. IC50 values were then
determined with GraphPad Prism.

General Sonogashira Procedure
A
solution of bromo compound
(1 equiv), Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (10 mol %),
CuI (5 mol %), and triphenylphosphine (10 mg) in triethylamine was
deoxygenated using argon gas. A deoxygenated solution of 5-ethynyl-N-(4-((4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)nicotinamide
(1.2 equiv) in DMF was added slowly over 10 min to the solution. The
reaction temperature was increased to 55 °C and stirred for 12
h. The reaction was then diluted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer
was washed with water, saturated NH4Cl, and brine. Combined
organic layers were dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered,
and concentrated in vacuo. The pure product was obtained by flash
column chromatography.
