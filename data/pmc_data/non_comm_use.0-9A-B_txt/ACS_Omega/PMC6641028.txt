Mesocrystals
(basically nanostructures showing alignment of nanocrystals
well beyond crystal size) are attracting considerable attention for
modeling and optimization of functionalities. However, for surface-driven
applications (heterogeneous catalysis), only those mesocrystals with
excellent textural properties are expected to fulfill their potential.
This is especially true for oxidative desulfuration of dibenzothiophenes
(hard to desulfurize organosulfur compounds found in fossil fuels).
Here, we probe the catalytic activity of anatases for the oxidative
desulfuration of dibenzothiophenes under atmospheric pressure and
mild temperatures. Specifically, for this study, we have taken advantage
of the high stability of the (101) anatase surface to obtain a variety
of uniform colloidal mesocrystals (approximately 50 nm) with adequate
orientational order and good textural properties (pores around 3–4
nm and surface areas around 200 m2/g). Ultimately, this
stability has allowed us to compare the catalytic activity of anatases
that expose a high number of aligned single crystal-like surfaces
while differing in controllable surface characteristics. Thus, we
have established that the type of tetrahedral coordination observed
in these anatase mesocrystals is not essential for oxidative desulfuration
and that both elimination of sulfates and good textural properties
significantly improve the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the most
active mesocrystals have been used to model the catalytic reaction
in three-(oil–solvent–catalyst) and two-phase (solvent–catalyst)
systems. Thus, we have been able to observe that the transfer of DBT
from the oil to the solvent phase partially limits the oxidative process
and to estimate an apparent activation energy for the oxidative desulfuration
reaction of approximately 40 kJ/mol in the two-phase system to avoid
mass transfer limitations. Our results clearly establish that (101)
anatase mesocrystals with excellent textural properties show adequate
stability to withstand several post-treatments without losing their
initial mesocrystalline character and therefore could serve as models
for catalytic processes different from the one studied here.

Introduction
Organosulfur compounds of thiophenic base
are toxic pollutants
commonly found in fossil fuels (especially in diesel). As they are
responsible for air pollution and acid rain (SO2 formation
during combustion), their presence must be minimized.1−3 However, common desulfurization technologies such as hydrodesulfurization
that work relatively well for many sulfur-containing compounds require
strongly demanding conditions (high temperature and pressure) when
dealing with these sulfur compounds (mainly nonsubstituted and substituted
dibenzothiophenes, known as DBTs).4 Thus,
there is special interest to develop less demanding desulfuration
processes such as those based on the use of oxidants (oxidative desulfurization,
known as ODS). In principle, ODS can be carried out in the liquid
phase under very mild conditions (near room temperature and under
atmospheric pressure) as thiophenic compounds are among the most oxidizable
sulfur compounds.1−3,5,6 Still ODS faces significant challenges, among them the finding of
new solid catalysts that can efficiently catalyze this reaction.3

H2O2 is often used
for sulfoxidation as water
is the by-product of the catalytic reaction.7−9 Previous studies
on H/Na titanate nanotubes have shown good oxidation activity in the
presence of H2O2, though one of the conclusions
drawn from that study was that anatase clusters deactivated the catalytic
sites.10 There have been other studies
reporting that mesoporous anatase doped with phosphotungstic acid
(10%) was capable of oxidizing DBTs in combination with H2O2.11,12 However, these studies concluded
that the active species for ODS were the phosphotungstic groups. There
have been reports that TiO2 under UV-light irradiation
was capable of DBT photo-oxidation,13,14 but photocatalytic
studies are out of the scope of the results presented in this study.
However, recent studies on anatases dispersed in mesoporous carbons
(obtained after pyrolysis of Ti-based metal–organic frameworks
at 600 °C) have shown activity for oxidative desulfuration of
DBTs, though in this case the oxidant of choice was tert-butyl hydroperoxide.3 These previous
studies, and specially the one of Hicks’ group,3 led us to hypothesize that mesoporous anatases could show
adequate activity for oxidative desulfuration of DBTs using H2O2 as an oxidant.

Mesocrystals are considered
to be the optimal conformations to
both enhance and modeling material properties.15−29 More specifically, titanium oxide mesocrystals have shown improved
photocatalytic, optoelectronic, and lithium- and sodium-ion insertion
capabilities, and importantly, these unique nanostructures have facilitated
a better understanding of the functionality of materials.23,25,27,29−33 As the activity with solid catalysts mainly originates on surfaces,
and different surfaces expose different structural arrangements, the
most appropriate methods to study these processes should rely (if
possible) on single crystals.34 Furthermore,
single crystals avoid the hurdles of grain boundaries misalignments.
However, single crystals lack good textural properties. Mesocrystalline
nanostructures are characterized not only by exposing a majority of
a single crystal-like surface but also by the alignment of the nanocrystalline
building blocks. Indeed, grain boundaries exist, but their effect
is minimized by their alignment. Thus, these particular nanostructures
should allow closing the gap between nanostructures and single crystals.
Obviously, for catalysis, only those mesocrystals with good textural
properties are expected to fulfill this goal (there is a need for
surface accessibility throughout the volume). This is especially true
for the ODS of dibenzothiophenes in the presence of a solid catalyst
where high catalytic activities require good textural properties and
pore sizes around the mesoscale.3,7,35−46 Thus, the task is relatively difficult not because of exposing a
majority of a unique surface (when dealing with the most stable surface
as in anatase this is less difficult) but because of the characteristic
alignment of the building nanoblocks must be maintained with pores
in between.

The aim of the study here presented is to probe
the catalytic activity
of high surface area anatases for sulfoxidation of DBTs. More specifically,
to probe the catalytic activity of anatases through a variety of porous
mesocrystals having similar orientation and textural properties and
basically differing only on controllable surface characteristics.
As described above, the mesocrystalline character in nanostructures
(“the single-crystal behavior”) helps to better understand
the catalytic processes. Our initial idea is that the use of these
well-defined porous nanostructures could help us to better determine
limiting factors for sulfoxidation and therefore to identify pathways
for further improvement of the catalytic behavior of anatases or other
similar materials in this promising desulfuration process.

Recent
experimental and theoretical studies have prompted the interest
on obtaining anatases, exposing a large fraction of surfaces more
reactive than the (101) surface.47−49 Interestingly, stabilization
of these anatase surfaces usually requires dopants or adsorbates,
and besides, the resultant textural properties are not as good as
the ones required for sulfoxidation of DBTs.47 However, an important lesson that can be learned from those studies
is that if we aim to obtain anatase mesocrystals with good textural
properties and relatively good stability to allow some changes on
surface characteristics, these porous mesocrystals must expose a large
fraction of the energetically stable (101) surface. Some of us have
reported that uniform porous anatase mesocrystals with adequate alignment
of their constitutive building nanoblocks can be prepared by a combined
self-assembly/seeding process [majority of (101) exposed surfaces,
uniform colloidal size < 100 nm, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) areas around 200 m2/g, and pore size within the mesoscale].27,30,33 Herein, we use these porous anatase
mesocrystals for the oxidative desulfuration of DBTs under atmospheric
pressure and mild temperatures. Furthermore, by using simple post-treatments,
we are able to modify some surface characteristics while still preserving
the mesocrystalline character and textural properties. We understand
an additional advantage of these mesocrystals is their colloidal size
that allows good dispersibility of the materials when liquid suspensions
are involved (oxidative desulfuration is carried out in liquid). Detailed
characterization of all of these samples has helped us to better understand
and to optimize the activity of anatases for sulfoxidation.

Results
and Discussion
Catalysts Characterization
As mentioned
in the Experimental Section, the porous anatase
mesocrystals
used in this study were prepared following a route previously reported
by some of us.33 These mesocrystals were
further processed to alter the surface of mesocrystals in a controlled
way and later to determine the catalytic response. Specifically, the
pristine mesocrystals were treated with HNO3 and/or H2O2 (MCHN, MCH2O2, and MCHNH2O2). Details of the preparation can be found in
the Experimental Section. After different
post-treatments, preservation of the structural (including phase,
size, and mesocrystalline character) and textural characteristics
(surface area and pore size) was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
N2 isotherms, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) (Figures 1 and 2, and Table 1). Basically, all samples are anatase mesocrystals with a majority
of (101) exposed surfaces, a similar alignment of the constitutive
nanocrystals, a uniform colloidal size (approximately 50 nm), and
excellent textural properties for the oxidation of DBT compounds (mesoporous
centered at 3.5 nm and surface areas around 200 m2/g).
Preservation of the initial mesocrystalline character of the porous
colloidal aggregate was not unexpected once such aggregate is not
fragmented during the post-treatments. As described above, the (101)
surfaces are the most stable in anatase, and therefore, any rearrangement
leading to the formation of other anatase surfaces is unlikely. In
fact, one could reasonably argue that the formation of the pristine
mesocrystals, in the first place, was only possible because of the
presence of majority of the energetically favorable (101) surfaces.
Besides, possible crystal misalignments associated with crystal growth
are expected to be limited by the fact that anatase crystal sizes
remained similar after post-treatments.

Figure 1 XRD patterns, N2 isotherms, pore size distribution (BJH
model applied to the desorption curve), and TEM for pristine mesocrystals
(MC) and those treated with HNO3 (MCHN), H2O2 (MCH2O2), or HNO3 followed
by H2O2 (MCHNH2O2). Basically,
the structural, microstructural, and textural properties appear similar
after the different treatments.

Figure 2 HR-TEM pictures at different magnifications of the pristine mesocrystals
(MC) and the most severely post-treated mesocrystals (MCHNH2O2, treatment HNO3 followed by H2O2). The pictures show that MCHNH2O2 preserves the mesocrystalline character similar to that of the pristine
mesocrystals. In both samples, anatase nanocrystals within the colloidal
aggregate appear aligned in a preferential direction over extensive
areas with majority of (101) exposed surfaces.

X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), thermogravimetric
(TG) curves,
infrared (IR), and ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) studies
were carried out to estimate the surface characteristics of all mesocrystals
(including the pristine mesocrystals not previously characterized
using these techniques). For example, TiOSO4 was used as
a precursor for the synthesis of pristine mesocrystals. Sulfate groups
remaining on the surface are known to alter the catalytic activity
of anatases.34Figure 3 shows the XPS of Ti 2p and S 2p core levels
for all samples. For Ti 2p levels, the doublet arises from spin-orbit
splitting Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2.50The analysis of the Ti 2p3/2 levels (more intense signal) shows the binding energy values
of Ti 2p3/2 in all samples (Table 1) corresponding to Ti4+ (458.6
eV).51,52 The similarity in Ti 2p3/2 binding
energy values for all samples and the fact that no additional signals
were detected at lower binding energies (Ti3+ is characterized
by a shoulder, shifted approximately 2 eV to lower energy) suggest
that the post-treatment did not alter the Ti framework. Perhaps, the
most relevant result derived from the XPS study comes from the analysis
of the S 2p levels. Figure 3 and Table 1 shows the binding energy values (approximately 168.5–168.7
eV) that can be assigned to sulfate moieties.53 An analysis of their respective areas indicates a significant decrease in the
sulfate level with post-treatments (Table 1). A slight but systematic shift in the position
of the maxima was observed after different treatments. However, the
poor signal quality (especially for the H2O2-treated mesocrystals where sulfate content is low) along with the
slight shift precluded a meaningful analysis on the nature of sulfate
moieties. Furthermore, the conditions in which XPS were recorded (ultrahigh
vacuum) intrinsically limit the capability of this technique to unequivocally
determine the nature of sulfate species under operating conditions.
As we better describe below, this analysis was carried out using IR
spectroscopy. Finally, we must mention that the analysis of the O
1s core levels (Table 1) showed the typical titania signals assigned to lattice oxygens
(∼530 eV) and commonly to OHs (531.5 eV).52,54,55Table 1 summarizes the XPS binding energy values for the different
species.

Figure 3 XPS spectra corresponding to the Ti 2p and S 2p core levels for
all samples. The signal for S 2p was increased approximately 10 times
with respect to Ti 2p for a better visualization. Exact quantification
of the Ti/S molar ratio derived from the spectra is given in Table 1.

OH studies using XPS are certainly limited by the fact that
the
spectra were registered under ultrahigh vacuum conditions (10–9 Torr). Therefore, we carried out TG studies to basically
estimate whether the removal of sulfate generated new chemisorbed
OH species and to simultaneously extract some information on sulfate
losses. The results of this characterization are shown in Figure 4 and Table 1. We have also included the
TG analysis of titania P25 from Degussa (the standard for comparison,
50 m2/g). We must keep in mind that P25 is free of sulfates
(obtained from gas-phase flame synthesis using TiCl4 as
a precursor). First, Figure 4 shows a significant loss above 500 °C that must be mainly
associated with sulfates.34,56 Supporting this interpretation,
TG losses above this temperature follow the same trend as that estimated
by XPS for the content of sulfates (MC > MCHN > MCH2O2 > MCHNH2O2). Table 1 shows the estimation of the
S/Ti molar ratio
in samples by assuming that these losses mainly come from sulfates.
As expected, we observe an enrichment of sulfates on the surface (S/Ti
molar ratio from XPS higher than TG). Furthermore, the specifics of
sulfate losses are certainly ambiguous. Indeed, the sulfate losses
occur earlier for pristine mesocrystals, but the end point is detected
at lower temperatures for H2O2-treated samples
(∼470–820 °C = 350 °C for MC vs ∼630–760
°C = 130 °C for MCHNH2O2). The slower
rate for the pristine mesocrystals could be understood in terms of
a much broader distribution on sulfate bonding strengths. Basically,
sulfates on H2O2-treated mesocrystal surfaces
are lower in content and are more homogenous. Regarding the content
of chemisorbed water on samples (say OHs), a TG temperature region
between 120 and 500 °C is often used to estimate a significant
portion of these species.57 However, the
lower limit (exclusion of physisorbed water) depends on experimental
conditions, whereas in our case the upper limit slightly overlaps
with the sulfate elimination. Therefore, in Table 1, we show the losses corresponding to the
interval 150–450 °C. The pristine mesocrystals have the highest
content of sulfates and the lowest content of chemisorbed OH species.
However, all post-treated mesocrystals have similar content of chemisorbed
OH species despite the different sulfate content. These findings indicate
no straightforward correlation between the sulfate losses and OH generation.
Importantly, these results also seem to suggest that the surface of
the mesocrystals reaches saturation on chemisorbed OHs.

Figure 4 (A) TG curves,
(B) IR spectra in the sulfate region after background
subtraction, and (C) diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra (F(R) = (1 – R)2/2R) for all mesocrystals. As described in
the main text, MC corresponds to the pristine anatase mesocrystals,
and MCHN, MCH2O2, and MCHNH2O2 corresponds to the post-treated mesocrystals with HNO3, H2O2, and HNO3 followed
by H2O2, respectively. Titania P25 from Degussa
is also included in the TG and diffuse reflectance characterization.

As reported above, TG results
on sulfate losses are certainly ambiguous
and could be understood in terms of a much broader distribution on
sulfate bonding strengths of pristine when compared with post-treated
mesocrystals. Furthermore, XPS analysis is limited by the fact that
the spectra were registered under ultrahigh vacuum conditions (10–9 Torr) and the low content of sulfates (especially
for H2O2-treated samples). Thus, additional
information on the nature of the sulfate groups anchored to the surfaces
was obtained from the analysis of the IR spectra in the 1350–950
cm–1 region, where typically sulfate and bisulfate
ligands are detected.58−62 Specifically, in the pristine mesocrystals, absorption bands at
1210, 1135, 1050, and 995 cm–1 are clearly detected
(Figure 4). For post-treated
mesocrystals, the band at 1210 cm–1 decreases in
intensity to finally disappear in the H2O2-treated
mesocrystals. The bands at 1135, 1050, and 995 cm–1 also appear less intense or almost disappear, and importantly, the
separation between these bands (splitting) is less marked as the content
of sulfate diminishes in samples. Unambiguous assignation of these
bands is rather difficult as their position is within the range expected
for monodentate/bidentate sulfates, H-bonded sulfates, or bisulfate
ligands. However, the attachment of sulfates to the surfaces is understood
in terms of the loss in symmetry from a regular Td symmetry (free sulfates), to a distorted Td symmetry (outer-sphere complexes),
and to C3v and C2v symmetries (inner-sphere
complexes), with the subsequent loss in degeneration (new bands appear).58 Thus, the combination of IR and TG results suggest
that pristine mesocrystals contain a variety of strongly and weakly
interacting inner- and outer-sphere sulfate surface complexes, whereas
weakly outer-sphere sulfate complexes are likely predominant in post-treated
samples (specially H2O2-treated).

The
existence of isolated Ti(IV) sites tetrahedrally coordinated
by Si–O and OHs in titanias highly dispersed in amorphous/mesoporous
silica or zeolitic silicates is well-established.35,63−65 In fact, several studies have shown that oxidative
desulfuration reactions are catalyzed by these species.7,35,38,43 Interestingly, even though the (101) surface is characterized by
the presence of 5- and 6-fold titanium coordination,48,66 the existence of a 4-fold coordination has also been reported in
high surface area (101) anatases and often interpreted on the basis
of the existence at the surfaces of amorphous domains or simply defective
disordered clusters.67−69 Thus, to draw some conclusions on the catalytic activity
of pristine and post-treated mesocrystals toward the oxidation of
DBTs, there is a need to determine the coordination environment of
Ti(IV) ions. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy represents
a relatively simple and sensitive technique to determine Ti(IV) coordination
on solid samples, as ligand-to-metal charge transfer processes are
detected between 200 and 400 nm.63,64,70 Specifically, bands below approximately 230 nm have
been associated with the tetrahedral coordination. Above 230 nm, bands
have been typically associated with either 5- or 6-fold coordinations.64,70−72 At longer wavelengths, the spectra display the typical
broad features of bulk anatase and/or the standard for catalytic studies
(titania P25 from Degussa). Thus, UV–vis spectra were recorded
for all mesocrystalline samples with titania P25 included for comparison
(Figure 4). At 205–210
nm, both pristine (MC) and HNO3-treated (MCHN) mesocrystals
show an intense absorption band associated with the tetrahedral coordination.7,63−65 Both MC and MCHN samples contain a significant amount
of sulfate groups that could partially contribute to the 4-fold coordination
(Ti–O–S bonds). The presence of these bonds would support
the above-mentioned presence of strongly interacting inner-sphere
sulfate complexes in non-H2O2-treated samples.
However, the band is more intense for MCHN despite containing lower
content of sulfates. This result seems to suggest that acidic conditions
favor the stabilization of tetrahedral environments. Following this
argument, the stabilization of the tetrahedral coordination in the
pristine mesocrystals could be partially explained by the fact that
hydrolysis/condensation of TiOSO4 precursors is carried
out in strongly acid media (TiOSO4 is dissolved in concentrated
H2SO4). The spectra for MCH2O2 and MCHNH2O2 (H2O2 treatment was the latest for both samples) resemble that of P25.
The bands associated with the tetrahedral coordination disappear,
supporting the argument that this coordination is stabilized under
strong acidic conditions. The distinguishing broad feature that appears
at approximately 230 nm could be assigned to either polymeric 5-fold
titania species or octahedral coordination associated with the insertion
of water molecules as extraligands.64,70−72 Peroxo or superoxide groups seem to be excluded as they usually
lead to absorption bands at approximately 400–450 nm.73 These groups are characterized by their poor
stability even at room temperature,74 and
their absence must be associated with the washing and drying protocols
(60 °C under vacuum) carried out after the H2O2 treatment.

Catalytic Performance
To evaluate
the catalytic activity
of the samples, a three-phase liquid–liquid–solid [L
(oil)–L (solvent)–S (catalyst)] system was simulated,
using iso-octane as the oil phase and acetonitrile
as the solvent (polar) phase. The accepted mechanism for oxidative
desulfuration of DBTs occurs by simultaneous extraction/oxidation
of DBT in the solvent solution in the presence of the catalyst and
the oxidant. Figure 5A shows the catalytic activity of pristine (MC) and post-treated
mesocrystals (MCHN, MCH2O2, and MCHNH2O2). The catalytic activity of titania P25 (Degussa, 50
m2/g) is also included for comparison (free of sulfates). Figure 5A clearly shows that
there is an inverse correlation between the sulfate content and the
catalytic activity for the mesocrystalline samples. As described above,
the IR and TG analyses suggested that in post-treated mesocrystals
(especially H2O2-treated) not only the content
of sulfates was lower but also the interaction with the surface seemed
to be lower. Thus, the results shown in Figure 5A clearly indicate that for the oxidative
desulfuration reaction, sulfate groups inhibit the catalytic activity.
Furthermore, we also show that the sulfoxidation of DBTs does not
require Ti(IV) in tetrahedral coordination, unlike what is observed
in titanias isolated on high surface area silica or silicalite. MCHNH2O2, the most active mesocrystalline sample, also
has a lower sulfate content, and therefore, its activity is comparable
with that of P25 (no sulfates). After 10 min (Figure 5A), the catalytic activity of MCHNH2O2 doubles that of P25, even though MCHNH2O2 still contains some residual sulfates that as reported above
inhibit the catalytic activity. These results clearly reflect the
better textural properties of the mesocrystals when compared with
P25. Basically, despite MCHNH2O2 still contains
some sulfates, the higher surface area when compared with P25 (200
vs 50 m2/g) assures more active sites available for sulfoxidation.

Figure 5 (A) Conversion
efficiency of pristine and post-treated mesocrystals
for oxidative desulfuration of DBTs. The results for P25 from Degussa
are also shown. (B) Conversion efficiency as a function of the amount
of catalyst MCHNH2O2 and (C) conversion efficiency
as a function of the H2O2 content (expressed
as O/S ratio) using MCHNH2O2 as the catalyst.
The reaction conditions were as follows: for (A) 60 °C, 0.065
g of catalyst and oxidant/S (O/S) molar ratio of 12; for (B) 60 °C,
O/S molar ratio of 12 with the amount of MCHNH2O2 changing; for (C) 60 °C, 0.260 g of catalyst with O/S molar
ratio changing. In all cases, we use 350 ppm of S (in DBT) dissolved
in 65 mL of iso-octane and 12.5 mL of acetonitrile.

Figure 5A shows
that the activity of the catalyst MCHNH2O2 reaches
good conversion (80%) after 70 min of reaction time but at a relatively
slow rate. To improve the conversion rate for this catalyst, we have
modified several parameters. Figure 5B shows the catalytic activity after increasing the
amount of MCHNH2O2 catalyst (from 0.065 to 0.260
g). Increasing the amount of the catalysts leads to an increase in
the conversion rate. Full conversion was achieved only after 20 min
using 0.260 g of catalyst under the same conditions. Figure 5C shows the catalytic performance
at different H2O2 amounts (expressed as O/S
molar ratios). Increasing the O/S molar ratio leads to an increase
in conversion, reaching a maximum around a molar ratio of 12. A similar
trend has been observed for H/Na titanate nanotubes and for the photocatalytic-assisted
oxidation of DBTs by anatase.10,13 The decrease in conversion
at high H2O2 concentrations could be due to
unproductive H2O2 decomposition and/or possible
poisoning of active sites.10,13 We must mention that
O/S values can be considered high when compared with systems using
oxidants such as cyclohexanone peroxidase75,76 but are in the range expected using H2O2 as
an oxidant.9,11,77−80 As mentioned earlier, H2O2 assures water as
the by-product of the catalytic reaction, and the cost is low when
compared with other oxidants.

Transfer of organosulfur compounds
from the oil to the solvent
phase usually represents a limiting factor on sulfoxidation reactions.
Thus, the effect of mass transfer limitations has been also studied
using the most active catalyst (MCHNH2O2) in
the three-phase system configuration described above and a two-phase
L (solvent)–S (catalyst) system configuration (Figure 6A). Higher conversions were
obtained in the L–S system, demonstrating the existence of
mass transfer limitations. This result means that the liquid–liquid
extraction step does not occur fast enough and that the transfer of
DBT from the oil phase to the solvent phase limits the global rate
of the ODS process. The difference was small at the beginning of the
reaction and increased to ∼15% after 10 min of reaction time,
suggesting that mass transfer limitations become more important at
longer times.

an L–S system. For (D), T = 60 °C, O/S
= 12, 0.130 g of catalyst, and 15 min of reaction time in an L–S
system. In (D), previous to each test, the sample was washed several
times with a water–methanol solution.

Finally, the most active catalyst (MCHNH2O2) was used to obtain kinetic parameters. As a three-phase
L–L–S
system suffers from mass transfer limitations, a two-phase L–S
system was used to obtain those kinetic parameters (Figure 6B). A pseudo-first-order rate
model was found to be reasonable fit for the experimental data obtained
at four studied temperatures (50, 60, 70, and 80 °C). The specific
rate constant values (k) derived from the pseudo-first-order
rate equation were used to obtain an apparent activation energy (Ea) using the Arrhenius equation (Figure 6C). The value (approximately
40 kJ/mol) is within the range obtained for H/Na titanate nanotubes
(45 kJ/mol), polyoxometalates (55 kJ/mol), Ti-based metal–organic
frameworks (75 kJ/mol), and phosphotungstic-doped TiO2 matrixes
(55 kJ/mol).10,46,81,82 Preliminary studies on the cyclability of
the catalyst were carried out to determine its reusability (Figure 6D). The conversion
efficiency diminished only less than 10% after 4th cycle.

Conclusions
In summary, we have established that (101) anatase mesocrystals
of a monodisperse colloidal size and excellent textural properties
show adequate stability to withstand several post-treatments without
losing their mesocrystalline character. This stability has allowed
us to determine some limiting factors for efficient oxidative desulfuration
of DBTs. Thus, we have shown that sulfate groups inhibit the catalytic
activity. We have also shown that the type of tetrahedral coordination
observed in these anatase mesocrystals is not essential for the oxidation
of DBTs, unlike to what is observed in titanias highly diluted in
amorphous/mesoporous silica or zeolitic silicates. Catalytic studies
using optimized mesocrystals have allowed us to conclude that the
transfer of DBT from the oil to the solvent phase partially limits
the sulfoxidation process and to estimate an apparent activation energy
for the sulfoxidation reaction of approximately 40 kJ/mol. Finally,
our results suggest that (101) mesocrystals with good textural properties
could serve as excellent models for mechanistic studies in other catalytic
processes different from the one studied here.

Experimental Section
Mesocrystals
Synthesis, Postprocessing Protocols Using HNO3 and/or H2O2, and Nomenclature
The porous anatase
mesocrystals used in this study were prepared
following a route previously reported by some of us.33 The method consists of seeded-assisted hydrolysis/condensation
of TiOSO4 dissolved in nanomicelles undergoing a self-assembly
process driven by temperature. Details of the protocol can be found
in ref (33).

Postsynthesis treatment of mesocrystals consisted of their processing
with HNO3 and/or H2O2. The HNO3 treatment consisted of dispersing 250 mg of mesocrystals
in 20 mL of a 0.1 M HNO3 aqueous solution followed by 24
h stirring, centrifugation, washing with water several times, and
finally drying at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. The H2O2 treatment was similar to the HNO3 treatment, though
in this case a H2O2 (50 wt %) solution was used,
and the stirring was limited to 10 min. Some mesocrystals were treated
with both HNO3 and H2O2 (HNO3 followed by H2O2). The samples were
named MC (pristine mesocrystals derived from the synthesis), MCHN
(post-treatment with HNO3), MCH2O2 (post-treatment with H2O2), and MCHNH2O2 (post-treatment with HNO3 followed
by H2O2).

Characterization Methods
Phase identification was performed
by X-ray diffraction analysis using a Bruker D8 Advance instrument
(Cu Kα radiation, 40 kV, 30 mA). The crystal domain size was
determined from the X-ray profiles using the Scherrer equation. The
morphology, particle size, and crystallinity of the mesocrystals were
examined using TEM (2000 FX2, JEOL) and HR-TEM (300, JEOL). Nitrogen
adsorption–desorption isotherms were performed at −196
°C in a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 volumetric adsorption system.
The BET surface area was deduced from the analysis of the isotherm
at low pressures (0.05 to 0.20), whereas pore size distributions were
estimated using the Barrett−Joyner−Halenda (BJH) model applied to the
desorption curve. TG curves were recorded
in a Seiko EXSTAR 6300 instrument under air atmosphere (100 mL/min)
and with a ramp of 5 °C/min. Infrared spectra
were recorded in a Bruker IFS 66V-S instrument by diluting the samples
in a KBr pellet. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded
on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating
sphere. A BaSO4 disk was used as a reference. All spectra
were recorded under ambient conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectra
(XPS) registered under ultrahigh vacuum conditions (10–9 Torr) were recorded on a MicrotechMultilb 3000 spectrometer. The
spectrometer is equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer and
an Mg Kα (hν = 1253.6 eV) photon source.
An estimated error of ±0.1 eV can be assumed for all measurements.
The peak intensity was calculated from the respective peak areas after
background subtraction and spectrum fitting by a combination of Gaussian/Lorentzian
functions.

Catalytic Experiments
The catalytic
sulfoxidation of
DBTs with hydrogen peroxide was carried out batchwise in a mechanically
stirred 250 mL thermostated glass reactor equipped with a thermometer,
a reflux condenser, and a septum for withdrawing samples. In a typical
experiment, 65 mL of 350 ppm of sulfur as DBT in iso-octane (Aldrich, 99 wt %) was heated to 60 °C. Then, 12.5 mL
of acetonitrile was added to the nonpolar phase, and the catalyst
(0.065 g) was loaded into the reactor at atmospheric pressure. Finally,
a solution of hydrogen peroxide (50 wt %) was introduced into the
reactor. Aliquots were taken from the reactor at different reaction
times. Importantly, the total amount withdrawn from the reactor was
less than 10% to avoid interference in the reaction results because
of the changes in the total mass inside of the reactor. The nonpolar
phase was recovered by decantation and analyzed by a GC-PFPD (HP5890)
instrument equipped with a capillary column (HP-WAX, 25 m, 0.53 mm,
and 1.0 mm film thickness). The presence of oxidized products in polar
acetonitrile was confirmed by GC–mass spectrometry (HP5890).

The conversion of DBT was calculated by checking the remaining
sulfur in both phase systems: L–S and L–L–S.
The conversion of DBT was calculated according to the following equation XDBT = ((C0 – Ct)/C0) × 100%, with C0 and Ct being the concentration of DBT at t = 0 and t min, respectively. Aliquots
were taken from the oil phase at different reaction times after decantation
and analyzed by a GC-PFPD (HP5890) instrument equipped with a capillary
column (HP-WAX, 25 m, 0.53 mm, and 1.0 mm film thickness) using n-decane as an external standard. Importantly, the total
amount withdrawn from the reactor was less than 10% to avoid interference
in the reaction results because of the changes in the total mass inside
of the reactor. The presence of oxidized products in polar acetonitrile
was confirmed by GC–mass spectrometry (HP5890) and compared
with the available standard compounds where available.

To determine
the specific rate constant (k) at
different temperatures, we used a pseudo-first-order equation (ln(Ct/C0) = −kt), with C0 and Ct being the concentration
of DBT at t = 0 and t min, respectively.
The Arrhenius plot (k = A exp(Ea/RT)) was used to determine
the apparent activation energy (Ea) for
the oxidation reaction, with A being the pre-exponential
factor and R and T being the gas
constant and temperature in kelvin, respectively.
