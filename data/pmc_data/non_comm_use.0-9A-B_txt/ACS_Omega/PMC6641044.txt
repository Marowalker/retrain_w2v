Polymeric
ruthenium porphyrin-functionalized carbon nanotubes (Ru-PP/CNTs)
were prepared by the metallation of polymeric porphyrin-functionalized
carbon nanotubes (PP/CNTs) with Ru3(CO)12, whereas
PP/CNTs were obtained by the condensation of terephthaldehyde and
pyrrole in the presence of CNTs. The Ru-PP/CNTs have a thin layer
of highly cross-linked polymeric ruthenium porphyrin coating over
the CNT surface via strong π–π stacking interactions,
thus showing a bilayered structure with an amorphous polymeric outer
surface and an internal CNT core. Polymeric ruthenium porphyrin-functionalized
reduced graphene oxide (Ru-PP/RGO) was prepared with a synthetic procedure
similar to Ru-PP/CNTs, with RGO as the internal core. Both Ru-PP/CNTs
and Ru-PP/RGO showed excellent catalytic performance toward hydrogenation
of biomass-related ethyl levulinate (EL) to γ-valerolactone
(GVL) with Ru-centered porphyrin units as the catalytic active species.
Under optimized reaction conditions, a GVL yield higher than 99% with
a complete conversion of EL was observed over both Ru-PP/CNTs and
Ru-PP/RGO. In addition to GVL preparation, the versatile Ru-PP/CNTs
can efficiently promote reductive amination of EL with various amines
for the synthesis of pyrrolidone derivatives, with the corresponding
yields ranging from 96.3 to 88.7%. Moreover, the composite materials
of both Ru-PP/CNTs and Ru-PP/RGO behave as heterogeneous catalysts
in the reaction system and can be easily reused.

1 Introduction
The
over reliance of our society on the diminishing and nonrenewable
fossil resources such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas is pushing
researchers to find a renewable alternative for a sustainable supply
of chemicals and fuels. In this aspect, renewable and abundant biomass
is considered as a promising and potential resource to reduce our
dependence on fossil resources.1−3 In addition, the carbon-neutral
nature of the biomass can maintain the carbon balance of our environment
and diminish the negative effects triggered by the use of fossil resources
such as CO2 emission and environmental degradation. Among
the biomass-derived platform molecules, γ-valerolactone (GVL)
is a versatile building block for valuable chemicals and a green and
efficient solvent for biomass conversion.4 In addition, GVL is widely used in the food industry and has high
potential applications in the production of fuel precursors for gasoline
and diesel.5,6

GVL is generally prepared by the hydrogenation
of cellulose-derived
levulinic acid (LA) with homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts, and
ruthenium (Ru) catalysts generally exhibit excellent activity and
selectivity.7−9 Various Ru-based catalysts have been reported for
the hydrogenation of LA and levulinic ester to GVL, including homogeneous
catalysts of RuCl3–PPh3,10 Ru(acac)3–PBu3 (acac, acetylacetonate),11 Ru(acac)3–P(n-oct)3,12 Ru(acac)3–TPPTS [TPPTS, tris(3-sulfophenyl)phosphine trisodium salt],13 and Shvo catalyst,14 heterogeneous catalysts of Ru/C,15−20 Ru/MOFs (metal–organic frameworks),21 Ru/TiO2,22,23 Ru/SiO2,24 Ru/Beta-12.5 (DeAl-H-beta),25 Ru/hydroxyapatite26 Ru3(CO)12-derived Ru nanoparticles (NPs),27 Ru/SBA-SO3H (sulfonic acid-functionalized mesoporous
silica),28 and Ru/SPES (sulfonated polyethersulfone),29 and bimetallic catalysts of Ru–Re/C,30,31 Ru–Sn/C,32,33 Ru–Ni/Meso-C,34 Ru–Pd/TiO2,35 and Ru–La/Al2O3.36

Ru-based homogeneous catalysts generally
showed outstanding catalytic
performance for GVL synthesis; however, toxic and air- and moisture-sensitive
phosphorus ligands were applied in the hydrogenation reactions.37 Therefore, inspired by nature, multidentate
nitrogen ligands such as porphyrins should be an excellent candidate
to promote the catalytic reactions under phosphane-free conditions.
In fact, ruthenium porphyrin complexes were reported as versatile
catalysts in various reactions such as selective hydrogenation of trans-cinnamaldehyde,38 epoxidation
of olefins,39 hydroxylation of hydrocarbons,40 disproportionation of nitricoxide,41 aziridination of styrenes,42,43 amination of olefins and benzylic C–H bond,44,45 and photocatalytic reactions.46 Hence,
we think that ruthenium porphyrin complexes should be promising catalysts
for the hydrogenation of LA and levulinic ester into GVL. However,
in most cases, ruthenium porphyrin complexes function as homogeneous
catalysts resulting in a separation problem for catalyst recycling.
In this research, polymeric ruthenium porphyrin-functionalized carbon
nanotubes (Ru-PP/CNTs, Scheme 1c) and polymeric ruthenium porphyrin-functionalized reduced
graphene oxide (Ru-PP/RGO) were prepared as recyclable heterogeneous
catalysts for ethyl levulinate (EL) hydrogenation to GVL (Scheme 2a). The Ru-PP/CNTs
were obtained by the metallation of polymeric porphyrin-functionalized
CNTs (PP/CNTs) with Ru3(CO)12 (Scheme 1c), whereas PP/CNTs were prepared
by the condensation of terephthaldehyde and pyrrole in the presence
of CNTs (Scheme 1b).
The Ru-PP/CNTs have a thin layer of highly cross-linked polymeric
metalloporphyrin coating over the CNT surface via strong π–π
stacking interactions, thus showing a bilayered structure with an
amorphous polymeric outer surface and an internal CNT core. Under
optimized reaction conditions, a GVL yield higher than 99% with a
complete conversion of EL was observed over both Ru-PP/CNTs and Ru-PP/RGO.
In addition to GVL preparation, the versatile Ru-PP/CNTs can efficiently
promote reductive amination of EL with various amines for the synthesis
of pyrrolidone derivatives (Scheme 2a).

Pyrrolidine derivatives are widely used in many regions
such as
solvents, surfactants, and complexing agents.47−49 Generally,
pyrrolidines are obtained by the amination of LA or levulinic ester
with amines under a noncatalytic process by using formic acid50 or under catalytic hydrogenation/transfer hydrogenation
conditions by using carbon- or metal oxide-supported transition metal
catalysts, including Pt,51,52 Ru,53 Au,54,55 and Ir.56 In our case, the developed Ru-PP/CNTs smoothly catalyzed the transformation
of EL and primary amines into 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and 5-methyl-N-alkyl-2-pyrrolidones under a hydrogen atmosphere. Notably,
the 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and 5-methyl-N-alkyl-2-pyrrolidones
(alkyl = n-propyl, n-butyl, and n-octyl) were obtained in one pot with excellent yields
from 96.3 to 88.7% under the investigated conditions.

2 Results and Discussion
Polymeric porphyrin (PP, Scheme 1a) was synthesized
via direct condensation of terephthaldehyde
with pyrrole.57 The resulting PP bears
highly cross-linked and covalently linked porphyrin units throughout
the whole polymer matrices, whereas PP/CNTs (Scheme 1b) were obtained by the condensation of terephthaldehyde
and pyrrole in the presence of CNTs. The porphyrin ring is a π-conjugated
system in a planar arrangement with a total of 26 electrons and an
18π aromatic character, whereas CNTs have a sp2-hybridized
graphite structure and a π-conjugated backbone. Therefore, the
formation of a stable and uniform PP/CNT composite is presumably attributed
to the strong π–π stacking interactions between
the porphyrin units of highly cross-linked PP and the external wall
of the CNTs (Scheme 1b). Ru-PP/CNTs were achieved by the metallation of PP/CNTs with Ru3(CO)12 (Scheme 1c), whereas polymeric rhodium porphyrin complex-functionalized
CNTs (Rh-PP/CNTs) and polymeric iridium porphyrin complex-functionalized
CNTs (Ir-PP/CNTs) were prepared by the metallation of PP/CNTs with
RhCl3 and IrCl3, respectively (Scheme 1c). PP-functionalized RGO (PP/RGO)
and Ru-PP/RGO were synthesized following the same synthetic procedure
used for PP/CNTs and Ru-PP/CNTs, respectively, except that the corresponding
support CNTs were replaced by RGO. The resulting composite materials
PP/CNTs, PP/RGO, Ru-PP/CNTs, Rh-PP/CNTs, Ir-PP/CNTs, and Ru-PP/RGO
were systematically characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray
diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption–desorption, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission
spectroscopy (ICP-AES). In addition, Ru-PP/CNTs, Rh-PP/CNTs, Ir-PP/CNTs,
and Ru-PP/RGO were used as heterogeneous catalysts in the transformations
of biomass-derived LA and levulinic ester into GVL and pyrrolidone
derivatives (Scheme 2a).

SEM of PP/CNTs and typical HRTEM images of CNTs, PP/CNTs,
and Ru-PP/CNTs
are compared in Figure 1. Pristine CNTs exhibited a smooth surface with a graphitized structure
(Figure 1a,b). By contrast,
a composite material of PP/CNTs had a thin layer of PP coating of
around 3–5 nm over the CNT surface, thus showing a bilayered
structure with an amorphous and rough outer surface and an internal
CNT core (Figure 1e,f).
SEM of PP/CNTs demonstrated a uniform deposition of CNTs with a thin
layer of PP (Figure 1c,d). Both SEM (Figure 1c,d) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1e,f) analyses of PP/CNTs indicated
the fibrous and uniform composite PP/CNTs with a diameter of around
30 nm and length of several micrometers. After metallation of the
composite PP/CNTs with Ru3(CO)12 to give Ru-PP/CNTs,
TEM analysis indicated the supported ruthenium porphyrin species homogeneously
and highly distributed throughout the surface of the Ru-PP/CNTs (Figure 1g–i). The
formation of these uniform and highly distributed electron-dense regions
can be attributed to the presence of ruthenium porphyrin complexes.
The mean diameters of these electron-dense regions were around 0.72
nm (Figure 1g), which
was presumably caused by the beam damage during the TEM analysis and
the light-sensitive nature of ruthenium porphyrin complexes, leading
to decarbonylation of ruthenium porphyrin species, ruthenium atom
migration, ruthenium cluster formation, and even resulting in the
formation of ruthenium NPs. A similar phenomenon was previously observed
by the TEM analysis on iridium N-heterocyclic carbene complexes covalently
attached on CNTs,58 Ir(C2H4)2 species bonded to MgO, and the zeolite surface.59 At this stage, our XPS analysis on Ru-PP/CNTs
also confirmed the presence of Ru-centered porphyrin units in Ru-PP/CNTs
(Figure 6b, will be
discussed below). Reduction of Ru-PP/CNTs with H2 at 200
°C led to the partial formation of ruthenium NPs supported on
PP/CNTs (Ru NPs/PP/CNTs). The TEM images of Ru NPs/PP/CNTs showed
that the Ru NPs were uniform and highly dispersed throughout the surface
of PP/CNTs with a mean NP size of around 1.7 nm (Figure 1j,k), suggesting polymeric
immobilization effect of PP/CNTs on the Ru NPs. The formation of Ru(0)
NPs over PP/CNTs was indicated by the subsequent XPS analysis (Figure 6c, will be discussed
below). Moreover, Ru NPs encapsulated in N-doped CNTs (Ru NPs/N-CNTs)
were obtained by the heat treatment of Ru-PP/CNTs with a pyrolysis
temperature of 800 °C under a N2 atmosphere. HRTEM
analysis showed that the Ru NPs were encapsulated in a carbon shell
with a NP size of around 10 nm (Figure 1l,m).

Ru NPs/PP/CNTs (j,k), and Ru NPs/N-CNTs (l,m) and SEM of PP/CNTs (c,d).

Figure 2 shows typical
HRTEM images of RGO, PP/RGO, and Ru-PP/RGO. RGO nanosheets have a
wrinkled, rippled, and crumpled structure (Figure 2a,b).60,61 After the functionalization
of RGO with PP, the composite material of PP/RGO showed a thin layer
of PP with a rough outer surface (Figure 2c–e). Metallation of the composite
PP/RGO with Ru3(CO)12 gave Ru-PP/RGO; TEM analysis
showed the electron-dense regions uniformly and highly distributed
on the surface of Ru-PP/RGO (Figure 2f–h), indicating successful formation of ruthenium
porphyrin species on Ru-PP/RGO.

Figure 2 TEM images of RGO (a,b), PP/RGO (c–e),
and Ru-PP/RGO (f–h).

The obtained Ru-PP/CNTs and Ru-PP/RGO were further characterized
by powder XRD. Both Ru-PP/CNTs and Ru-PP/RGO showed two characteristic
peaks at 2θ values around 25° and 43°, as shown in Figure 3.62,63 The peak at 2θ of 25° with high intensity was assigned
as the hexagonal graphite characteristic diffraction peak (002) plane,
whereas the peak at 2θ of 43° with low intensity was related
to the (100) plane.64,65 However, the diffraction peaks
corresponding to Ru crystallite were unobserved over both two Ru catalysts,
indicating the major active species of Ru-centered porphyrin units
for the two samples. In addition, the intensity of the two characteristic
diffraction peaks at 25° and 43° observed in Ru-PP/CNTs
significantly decreased compared with those of the pristine CNTs.66 Similar changes in the intensity of the XRD
patterns were also observed between Ru-PP/RGO and RGO, as shown in Figure 3.

RGO, Ru-PP/CNTs, and Ru-PP/RGO.

distribution curve, and the textural properties for Ru-PP/CNTs, Ru-PP/RGO,
Rh-PP/CNTs, Ir-PP/CNTs, CNTs, and RGO are shown in Figure 4 and Table 1. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of the precursor CNTs is 148.6 m2 g–1, which significantly decreased to 99.3 m2 g–1 for Ru-PP/CNTs, 91.1 m2 g–1 for Rh-PP/CNTs, and 92.5 m2 g–1 for
Ir-PP/CNTs. Similarly, Ru-PP/RGO showed a decreased BET surface area
compared with the precursor RGO. The reduced surface area of Ru-PP/CNTs,
Rh-PP/CNTs, Ir-PP/CNTs, and Ru-PP/RGO is attributed to the formation
of composite materials of PP-CNTs and PP-RGO.

The solid-state 13C NMR spectra of RGO
and Ru-PP/RGO
are compared in Figure 5. RGO showed one main peak at 120 ppm designating the resonance as
a result of sp2 graphitic carbon,67 whereas Ru-PP/RGO revealed six main peaks from 192 to 104 ppm (Figure 5). The peak at 192
corresponded to the carbonyl group binding to the Ru(II) center.68 The resonances from 134 to 130 ppm were indexed
to the phenylene linkages, whereas the signals at 112 and 104 ppm
were assigned to porphyrin macrocycles.57,69−71 Finally, the peak at 120 ppm was designated to the sp2 graphitic carbon from the RGO support. The 13C NMR analysis
of Ru-PP/RGO indicated the formation of composite materials of polymeric
ruthenium porphyrin and RGO.

Figure 5 Solid-state 13C NMR spectra of RGO
and Ru-PP/GRO.

The XPS analysis was
further performed to study the chemical composition
of the sample surface. Figure 6a shows
the scan survey XPS spectrum of Ru-PP/CNTs, Ru-PP/RGO, Ru NPs/PP/CNTs,
Rh-PP/CNTs, and Ir-PP/CNTs, confirming the existence of ruthenium
for Ru-PP/CNTs, Ru-PP/RGO, and Ru NPs/PP/CNTs, rhodium for Rh-PP/CNTs,
iridium for Ir-PP/CNTs, and nitrogen for all of the five samples (Scheme 1c). In addition,
chlorine peaks were observed at 198.7 eV for Rh-PP/CNTs and at 198.4
eV for Ir-PP/CNTs (Figure 6a), which confirms the counterion function of the Cl– ion for the positively charged Rh3+ ion in the Rh-PP/CNT
and Ir3+ ion in the Ir-PP/CNT samples (Scheme 1c).72 The Ru 3d5/2 XPS of Ru-PP/CNTs showed two signals at
281.4 and 282.3 eV. The signal at 281.4 eV was characteristic of those
typical Ru2+ complexes coordinated with N-ligands, confirming
the existence of Ru(II)-centered porphyrin units in Ru-PP/CNTs,73−76 whereas the other signal at 282.3 eV was assigned to the oxidation
state of Ru(VI) corresponding to the trans-dioxo
Ru(VI) porphyrin species [RuVI(O)2PP].77,78 The formation of dioxygen species [RuVI(O)2PP] was presumably attributed to the exposure of RuII-PP/CNTs
to air atmosphere leading to the oxidation reaction. This assumption
can be proved by the fact that the oxidation of (5,10,15,20-tetramesitylporphyrinato)ruthenium(II)carbonyl
[RuII(TMP)(CO)] led to the formation of trans-dioxoruthenium (VI) porphyrin species [RuVI(TMP)(O)2].79 The Ru 3d3/2 XPS
signal of Ru-PP/CNTs at 286.0 eV strongly overlaps with the intense
C 1s peak from the support, which prevents the accurate analysis of
the Ru-oxidation state from this binding energy value.76,80−82 The Ru 3d XPS of Ru-PP/RGO is very close to that
of Ru-PP/CNTs (Figure 6b,f). In the case of Ru NPs/PP/CNTs, the Ru 3d XPS spectrum can be
deconvoluted into two sets of doublet peaks with different intensities
(Figure 6c). The doublet
with peaks at 281.4 (assigned to Ru 3d5/2) and 286.0 eV
(assigned to Ru 3d3/2) can be indexed to the RuII state. The other set with binding energies at 279.8 (assigned to
Ru 3d5/2) and 284.1 eV (assigned to Ru 3d3/2) was ascribed to the Ru0 state.83,84 This result proved that the Ru-centered porphyrin species in Ru-PP/CNTs
was partially reduced to give Ru0 NPs supported on PP/CNTs
after H2 treatment at 200 °C. In addition, the separation
distance between the Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3d3/2 peaks
was 4.0–4.1 eV. Therefore, the Ru 3d3/2 line could
be expected to fall in the range of 284.1–284.2 eV, close to
the C 1s line (284.6 eV). Therefore, the broad peak centered at 284.6
eV is attributed to a coincidence of Ru0 3d and C 1s.85

For the Rh-PP/CNT sample, the Rh 3d XPS signal can be deconvoluted
into two distinguishable doublets with different intensities. The
doublet observed with higher binding energies at 314.0 eV (assigned
to Rh 3d3/2) and 309.4 eV (assigned to Rh 3d5/2) can be attributed to the Rh3+ species, indicating the
formation of Rh(III)Cl-centered porphyrin species in Rh-PP/CNTs.86,87 The other set of doublet at 311.8 eV (assigned to Rh 3d3/2) and 306.9 eV (assigned to Rh 3d5/2) can be indexed to
the Rh0 state, suggesting the presence of Rh0 NPs supported on PP/CNTs in the Rh-PP/CNT sample,88,89 whereas the Rh3+ oxidation state was observed as the
major phase (69%) on the surface of the Rh-PP/CNT sample according
to the integration areas of the two doublets.

The Ir 4f XPS
region of the Ir-PP/CNTs showed a doublet at 62.1
eV (assigned to Ir 4f7/2) and 65.1 eV (assigned to Ir 4f5/2) with a 4f7/2/4f5/2 ratio of 4:3.
The single signal of the Ir 4f7/2 peak at a binding energy
of 62.1 eV was fully consistent with iridium in the Ir(III) oxidation
state, confirming the presence of Ir(III)Cl-centered porphyrin units
in the Ir-PP/CNTs.90,91

After a systematical characterization
of Ru-PP/CNTs, Ru-PP/RGO,
Rh-PP/CNTs, and Ir-PP/CNTs, the catalytic performance of the resulting
Ru, Rh, and Ir catalysts was subsequently investigated with EL hydrogenation
to GVL in methanol as a model reaction, using NaHCO3 as
the cocatalyst (Scheme 2a). The influence of metallic sites was initially conducted. As expected,
the target product GVL was unobserved under catalyst-free conditions
(Table 2, entry 1).
Under such conditions, NaHCO3 functioned as Brønsted
base and promoted transesterification of EL with methanol to quantitatively
give methyl levulinate (ML, Table 2, entry 1). Actually, the NaHCO3-promoted
transesterification can be smoothly performed at room temperature
by producing an ML yield around 59.6% (Table 2, entry 21). When PP/CNTs were examined as
a transition metal-free catalyst for the blank experiment, EL was
again quantitatively converted into ML with a negligible GVL yield
(Table 2, entry 2).
However, the contribution from PP/CNTs to the transesterification
was very limited at room temperature (Table 2, entry 22). As transition metal catalysts,
Rh-PP/CNTs and Ir-PP/CNTs were moderately active to EL hydrogenation,
affording GVL yields of 59.8 and 52.1% (Table 2, entries 3 and 4), respectively. In the
case of Ru-PP/CNTs, a quantitative GVL yield of 99.1% with a full
conversion of EL was obtained, suggesting an excellent catalytic performance
of Ru-PP/CNTs over Rh-PP/CNTs and Ir-PP/CNTs in terms of GVL yield
under the investigated conditions (Table 2, entry 5). The catalytic performance of
Ru-PP/CNTs, Rh-PP/CNTs, and Ir-PP/CNTs was further quantitatively
compared in terms of the GVL formation rate. Herein, the formation
rate of GVL was measured under a moderate GVL yield level of around
50%, given as the amount of formed GVL per amount of transition metal
atoms per hour for the investigated catalyst. The resulting GVL formation
rates from EL hydrogenation were 25.9 molGVL molRu–1 h–1 for Ru-PP/CNTs, 10.3 molGVL molRh–1 h–1 for Rh-PP/CNTs, and 6.9 molGVL molIr–1 h–1 for Ir-PP/CNTs, further indicating an outstanding
catalytic performance of Ru-PP/CNTs over Rh-PP/CNTs and Ir-PP/CNTs.

1.0 mmol), catalyst (0–50 mg), cocatalyst (0–0.6 mmol),
methanol (5 mL), PH2 (3.0 MPa), T (100 °C), and t (10 h).

b The reactions were performed at
room temperature rather than 100 °C. For the reactions of EL
hydrogenation to GVL, refer to Scheme 2a.

To prove
whether the organometallic Ru-porphyrin species is the
true active site of Ru-PP/CNTs for the hydrogenation reaction, Ru-PP/CNTs
were calcined at 800 °C for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere,
and Ru NPs/N-CNTs were obtained (Figure 1l,m). However, a significantly low GVL yield
of 24.3% was obtained from the Ru NPs/N-CNTs (Table 2, entry 7). Under such conditions, the reduced
catalytic performance of Ru NPs/N-CNTs on the GVL formation can presumably
be related to the significantly increased Ru NP size and the encapsulated
structure of Ru NPs, which inhibits the access of EL and the migration
of GVL away from the active site of the Ru catalyst. In addition,
Ru-PP/CNTs were further treated with H2 (3.0 MPa) at 200
°C to give Ru NPs supported on the PP/CNT composite (Ru NPs/PP/CNTs)
(Figure 1j,k). A reduced
GVL yield of 72.6% was observed from the Ru NPs/PP/CNTs compared with
a GVL yield of 99.1% from Ru-PP/CNTs (Table 2, entries 5 and 6). The above results indicate
that the Ru-porphyrin species of Ru-PP/CNTs is the true active site
for the hydrogenation reaction. The influence of Ru-PP/CNT loading
levels on the EL-to-GVL transformation revealed a rise in the GVL
yield with an increasing catalyst dosage under the investigated reaction
conditions (Table 2, entries 5, 8–11).

The influence of various cocatalysts
on the hydrogenation of EL
to GVL was further studied. In the absence of the cocatalyst, the
catalytic performance of Ru-PP/CNTs by itself was inferior, producing
a GVL yield of 9.4% (Table 2, entry 12). Notably, a combination of Ru-PP/CNTs and NaHCO3 significantly promotes the EL-to-GVL transformation, and
GVL yields of 99.1% were dramatically achieved (Table 2, entry 5). Cocatalysts Na2CO3 and NaOH were moderately active to promote the transformation
(Table 2, entries 13
and 14), whereas both potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) showed limited effects
on GVL formation (Table 2, entries 15 and 16). In general, NaHCO3 was superior
to other cocatalysts in terms of GVL yields under the
examined conditions. Reducing the loading level of the cocatalyst
NaHCO3 resulted in a significantly decreased yield of GVL
(Table 2, entries 5,
17–20).

The effect of reaction temperature on the GVL
yield indicated that
the GVL yield increased from 53.2% at room temperature to 99.1% at
100 °C under the investigated conditions (Table 3, entries 1–5). Although the transesterification
of EL with methanol was suppressed at room temperature, ML was still
observed as intermediate for the EL-to-GVL transformation. The effect
of reaction time on the reactions showed an increase in the GVL yield
with the reaction time (Table 3, entries 1 and 6–9). In addition, an increase in the
hydrogen pressure efficiently promoted the EL-to-GVL transformation
(Table 3, entries 1
and 10–11). Methanol was an excellent solvent for EL hydrogenation
to GVL over Ru-PP/CNTs, producing a quantitative yield of GVL (Table 3, entry 1), whereas
ethanol was a good reaction medium for the hydrogenation, and a moderate
GVL yield of 86.9% was obtained (Table 3, entry 12). tert-Butanol and tetrahydrofuran
(THF) were not suitable solvents for the reaction, giving low yields
of the desired product (Table 3, entries 13–14).

a Reaction conditions: EL (144 mg,
1.0 mmol), Ru-PP/CNTs (50 mg), NaHCO3 (50 mg, 0.60 mmol),
solvent (5 mL), PH2 (1.0–3.0
MPa), T (r.t.–100 °C), and t (2–10 h). For the reactions of EL hydrogenation to GVL, refer
to Scheme 2a.

To probe the reaction scope, both
ML and LA were subjected to the
Ru-PP/CNT-promoted hydrogenation reaction, and GVL was obtained in
moderate and low yields, respectively, under the investigated conditions
(Scheme 2a and Table 4, entries 1–4).
The catalytic activities of Ru-PP/CNTs and Ru-PP/RGO were further
compared. The Ru-PP/RGO-promoted EL-to-GVL transformation gave a quantitative
GVL yield of 99.3% with excellent GVL selectivity when the reaction
was carried out at 100 °C. Notably, 87.2% yield of GVL was obtained
over Ru-PP/RGO even at room temperature (Table 4, entry 6), which is remarkably higher than
that over Ru-PP/CNTs producing a GVL yield of 53.2% (Table 3, entry 5), indicating outstanding
catalytic performance of Ru-PP/RGO over Ru-PP/CNTs. As expected, Ru-PP/RGO
can also promote ML-to-GVL and LA-to-GVL transformations under the
investigated conditions (Table 4, entries 7–10).

°C), and t (10 h).

b For the reactions of EL, ML, and
LA hydrogenation to GVL and the substituent group R in the table,
refer to Scheme 2a.

In addition to the catalytic
transformation of EL, ML, and LA to
GVL, the developed Ru-PP/CNTs were further investigated as the catalyst
for one-pot reductive amination of EL with various primary amines
to give 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and 5-methyl-N-alkyl-2-pyrrolidones
(Scheme 2a). As shown
in Table 5, 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
was obtained with NH4HCO3 as the nitrogen source
under the investigated conditions. For n-propylamine, n-butylamine, and n-octylamine, Ru-PP/CNTs
efficiently promoted the reductive amination reaction, yielding outstanding
yields of the corresponding pyrrolidone products. In the cases of
benzylamine and cyclohexylamine, relatively low yields of 5-methyl-N-benzyl-2-pyrrolidone and 5-methyl-N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone
were observed, respectively, with Ru-PP/CNTs.

Table 5 Ru-PP/CNT-Promoted
Reductive Amination
of EL with Various Amines for the Synthesis of Pyrrolidone Derivativesa
a Reaction conditions:
EL (144 mg,
1.0 mmol), NH4HCO3 or amine (1.2 mmol), Ru-PP/CNTs
(50 mg), THF (5 mL), PH2 (3.0
MPa), T (120 °C), and t (24
h).

b Methanol (5 mL) was
used as the
solvent rather than THF. For the reductive amination reactions, refer
to Scheme 2a.

Ru-PP/CNTs were recycled several
times in the hydrogenation of
EL to GVL to further investigate the stability of the catalyst. EL
conversions slightly decreased from 98.4 to 94.2% after a five-cycle
experiment, and GVL yields accordingly reduced from 90.4 to 72.7%
with the recycling times. The partial loss of the catalyst activity
in the EL hydrogenation was presumably owing to a reduced Ru content
during catalyst recycling (Table 1).

Scheme 2b illustrates
the proposed mechanism for Ru-PP/CNT-promoted EL transformation to
GVL. Initially, the NaHCO3 promoted the transesterification
of EL with the solvent methanol to give ML (Table 2, entry 21). A heterolytic cleavage of H2 by the ruthenium porphyrin species [Ru(Por), Scheme 2b] on the Ru-PP/CNT catalyst
in the presence of a base led to the formation of ruthenium porphyrin
hydride species [Ru(Por)(H)].92 At this
stage, the in situ formed Ru(Por)(H) readily transferred the hydride
ions to attack the carbonyl group of ML to yield methyl 4-hydroxypentanoate.
Meanwhile, Ru(Por)(H) was converted into Ru(Por) with the loss of
the hydride ion.93 A fast intramolecular
transesterification of methyl 4-hydroxypentanoate into GVL went together
with the equimolar production of methanol.

3 Conclusions
In summary, to heterogenize porphyrin complexes for the hydrogenation
of biomass-based LA and levulinic ester into GVL, Ru-PP/CNTs were
prepared by the metallation of PP/CNTs with Ru3(CO)12, whereas PP/CNTs were obtained by the condensation of terephthaldehyde
and pyrrole in the presence of CNTs. Ru-PP/RGO was prepared with a
synthetic procedure similar to Ru-PP/CNTs with RGO as the support.
Both Ru-PP/CNTs and Ru-PP/RGO showed excellent catalytic performance
toward EL hydrogenation to GVL, with Ru-centered porphyrin units as
the catalytic active species. Under optimized reaction conditions,
a GVL yield higher than 99% with a complete conversion of EL was observed
over both Ru-PP/CNTs and Ru-PP/RGO. In addition to GVL preparation,
the versatile Ru-PP/CNTs can efficiently promote reductive amination
of EL with various amines for the efficient synthesis of pyrrolidone
derivatives. Moreover, the two composite materials of Ru-PP/CNTs and
Ru-PP/RGO behave as heterogeneous catalysts in the reaction system
and can be easily reused.

4 Method
4.1 Materials
Reduced graphene oxide
(RGO) was prepared according to the method in the literature.94 The details of materials are provided in the Supporting Information.

4.2 Catalyst
Preparation
4.2.1 Synthesis of PP/CNTs
and PP/RGO
In a typical experimental procedure for PP/CNT
synthesis (Scheme 1b), a mixture of
terephthaldehyde (600 mg, 4.5 mmol) and CNTs (400 mg) in propanoic
acid (600 mL) was ultrasonicated for 30 min. The freshly distilled
pyrrole (304 mg, 4.5 mmol) was diluted in propionic acid (40 mL) and
then added dropwise to the above-mentioned mixture under vigorous
stirring and reflux conditions. The mixture was refluxed for an additional
3 h and then cooled to room temperature and filtered. The filter residue
was washed with deionized water, methanol, and dichloromethane and
then dried overnight in an oven at 80 °C overnight. Then, the
mixture was extracted with deionized water, dichloromethane, methanol,
and THF separately for 1 day by Soxhlet extraction and then vacuum
dried at 80 °C for 12 h.

PP/RGO was synthesized using a
similar synthetic procedure of PP/CNTs with RGO (400 mg) as the support.

4.2.2 Synthesis of Ru-PP/CNTs and Ru-PP/RGO
For Ru-PP/CNT synthesis (Scheme 1c), a mixture of PP/CNTs (150 mg) and Ru3(CO)12 (50 mg, 78 μmol) was refluxed in decalin
(50 mL) for 6 h under a nitrogen atmosphere, after which it was cooled
and filtered. The filter cake was washed thoroughly with dichloromethane
and then vacuum dried at room temperature overnight to give the ruthenium
catalyst Ru-PP/CNTs.

Ru-PP/RGO was synthesized using a similar
synthetic procedure of Ru-PP/CNTs with PP/RGO (150 mg) as the support.

4.2.3 Synthesis of Rh-PP/CNTs and Ir-PP/CNTs
For Rh-PP/CNT synthesis (Scheme 1c), a mixture of PP/CNTs (150 mg) and RhCl3 (50 mg, 24 μmol) in benzonitrile (50 mL) was refluxed for
6 h under a nitrogen atmosphere, after which it was cooled and filtered.
The filter cake was washed thoroughly with dichloromethane and then
vacuum dried at room temperature overnight to give the rhodium catalyst
Rh-PP/CNTs.

Ir-PP/CNTs were synthesized using a similar synthetic
procedure of Rh-PP/CNTs with IrCl3 (50 mg, 14 μmol)
as the Ir catalyst precursor.

4.3 Catalyst
Characterization
ICP-AES
analysis was performed using a PerkinElmer Optima 8000 instrument.
Powder XRD patterns of the catalysts were obtained from an X’Pert
Pro MPD diffractometer (PANalytical) from 5° to 80° operated
at 40 kV and 40 mA with Ni-filtered Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406
nm) radiation. SEM images were recorded using a Hitachi S-4800 instrument
operated at 10 kV. The samples were placed on a conductive carbon
tape adhered to an aluminum sample holder. The morphological analysis
of the metal NPs was carried out using HRTEM (JEM-2100HR). Samples
for the HRTEM analysis were prepared by placing a drop of the suspension
of the catalyst sample in ethanol onto a carbon-coated copper grid,
followed by evaporating the solvent. XPS spectra was obtained with
a Kratos Axis Ultra (DLD) photoelectron spectrometer operated at 15
kV and 10 mA at a pressure of about 5 × 10–9 Torr using Al Kα as the exciting source (1486.6 eV). C 1s
photoelectron peak [binding energy (BE) = 284.6 eV] was used for the
binding energy calibration.

4.4 Catalytic Performance
The experiments
for the synthesis of GVL from EL were executed using a 25 mL cylindrical
stainless steel high pressure reactor. In a typical reaction, Ru-PP/CNTs
(50 mg), EL (144 mg, 1.0 mmol), NaHCO3 (50 mg, 0.60 mmol),
and MeOH (5 mL) were added successively to a batch autoclave reactor.
After the reactor was purged several times with H2, the
outlet valve was closed and maintained at 3.0 MPa (ambient temperature)
in the system controlled by a large H2 gas reservoir that
was connected to the reaction cell. The stainless steel was heated
at 100 °C for 10 h with 600 rpm stirring speed. After the reaction,
the reactor was cooled to room temperature, and the reaction mixture
was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min. The products in the liquid
phase were then analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) (FL 9790II)
equipped with a capillary column (KB-5, 0.32 mm × 30 m) and a
flame ionization detector (FID) with N2 as the carrier
gas, using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as the internal
standard.

The experiments for the reductive amination of EL
to various pyrrolidone compounds were executed in a 25 mL cylindrical
stainless steel high pressure reactor. In a typical reaction, Ru-PP/CNTs
(50 mg), EL (144 mg, 1.0 mmol), n-butylamine (88
mg, 1.2 mmol), and THF (5 mL) were added successively to a batch autoclave
reactor. After the reactor was purged several times with H2, the outlet valve was closed and maintained at 3.0 MPa (ambient
temperature) in the system controlled by a large H2 gas
reservoir that was connected to the reaction cell. The stainless steel
was heated at 120 °C for 24 h with stirring speed of 600 rpm.
After the reaction, until the reactor was cooled to room temperature,
the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min. The products
in the liquid phase were then analyzed using GC (FL 9790II) equipped
with a capillary column (KB-5, 0.32 mm × 30 m) and an FID with
N2 as the carrier gas, using pentadecane as the internal
standard.
