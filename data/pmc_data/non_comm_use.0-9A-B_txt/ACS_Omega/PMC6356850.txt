We hypothesized that
identifying plasma glycoproteins that predict
the development of heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI)
could help to stratify subjects at risk. Plasma collected at visit
2 (2005–2008) from an MI subset of Jackson Heart Study participants
underwent glycoproteomics and was grouped by the outcome: (1) heart
failure hospitalization after visit 2 (n = 15) and
(2) without hospitalization by 2012 (n = 45). Proteins
were mapped for biological processes and functional pathways using
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and linked to clinical characteristics.
A total of 198 glycopeptides corresponding to 88 proteins were identified
(data available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD009870). Of
these, 14 glycopeptides were significantly different between MI and
MI + HF groups and corresponded to apolipoprotein (Apo) F, transthyretin,
Apo C-IV, prostaglandin-D2 synthase, complement C9, and CD59 (p < 0.05 for all). All proteins were elevated in the
MI + HF group, except CD59, which was lower. Four canonical pathways
were upregulated in the MI + HF group (p < 0.05
for all): acute phase response, liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor,
and macrophage reactive oxygen species generation. The coagulation
pathway was significantly downregulated in the MI + HF group (p < 0.05). Even after adjustment for age and sex, Apo
F was associated with the increased risk for heart failure (OR = 21.84;
95% CI 3.20–149.14). In conclusion, glycoproteomic profiling
provided candidate early MI predictors of later progression to heart
failure.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease
(CVD) is the leading cause of death in minorities
in the United States.1−4 Among non-Hispanic African Americans aged 20 years and older, ∼45%
have been diagnosed with CVD.1 Development
of heart failure (HF) following myocardial infarction (MI) in African
Americans carries higher morbidity.4 The
Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is the largest single-site, prospective,
epidemiologic CVD investigation in an African American population.
JHS is the largest study in history to investigate inherited factors
that affect high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, and diabetes
in the African American population.

The goal of the present
study was to determine HF prediction markers,
using plasma samples collected after MI and before the development
of symptoms. A total of 60 JHS participants were included; all had
been diagnosed with MI before visit 2 and none had progressed to HF
by visit 2. We hypothesized that the evaluation of post-MI plasma
samples, before HF was diagnosed, would reveal glycoprotein identifiers
predictive of future HF. Because transporting drugs across the plasma
membrane is technically challenging, enriching for extracellular proteins
identifies targets most amenable to therapy.5

Results and Discussion
Glycoproteomic Analysis Identified 198 Peptides
Belonging to
88 Unique Glycoproteins (Table S2)
Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1. Of the 60 participants, 15 (25%) experienced
subsequent HF hospitalization after visit 2 (n =
15), which is consistent with past reports.6−9 The development of HF incidence
rate was 19 per 100 person-years. A history of diabetes, hemoglobin
A1C, and sex were different between groups (all p < 0.05).

Although glycosylated albumin
has been linked to diabetes prevalence,
albumin does not contain the N–X–S/T motif for typical
N-linked glycosylation.10 Using an N-linked
glycoproteomic approach, therefore, removes the need to deplete albumin
and enhances extracellular protein representation.11,12 A total of 198 glycopeptides corresponding to 88 unique proteins
were identified (data available via ProteomeXchange with identifier
PXD009870). Of the glycopeptides identified, 14 were significantly
different between groups and corresponded to six unique glycoproteins
(all p < 0.05). The six proteins significantly
different by ANOVA were apolipoprotein F (Apo F), transthyretin, apolipoprotein
C-IV (Apo C4), prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase, complement C9, and CD59
(Tables 2 and S1, Figure S1).

a MI + HF/MI ratio
was obtained by
dividing mean MI + HF intensity value by mean MI intensity value.

In addition, there were three
proteins that showed differential
expression at the individual peptide level (complement C3, heparin
cofactor 2, and polymeric immunoglobin receptor); when intensity values
were added together for all glycopeptides identified in that protein,
significance was lost (Table 3). One possible reason for individual peptides to show a difference
that is not retained in the combined protein evaluation is that proteolytic
processing of these proteins may be occurring such that differences
in protein regions are observed. Proteolytic processing of extracellular
matrix (ECM) proteins such as collagen and CD36 have been linked to
adverse remodeling of the left ventricle following MI.13,14

Immunoblotting for four of the six proteins and peptides
matched
direction and quantity with the glycoproteomic data (Tables S1 and S2). Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, complement
C9, Apo F, and CD59 showed good correlation between methods, whereas
Apo C4 and transthyretin did not.

Canonical pathway analysis
of the glycoproteomic data indicated
that the 88 proteins identified belonged to 10 pathways (Figure 1). Of the 10 pathways,
three were upregulated in participants who developed HF: acute phase
response, liver X receptors/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR), and the
activation of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
in macrophage pathways. The coagulation system was downregulated in
participants who developed HF. The remaining six pathways showed no
direction with HF, suggesting that these pathways were in response
to MI or were due to a residual confounder and were not associated
with HF. These six pathways included FXR/RXR, clathrin-mediated endocytosis,
atherosclerosis signaling, interleukin (IL)-12 signaling in macrophages,
complement, and inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase.

Figure 1 Canonical pathway
analysis identified pathways associated with
HF. Canonical pathway analysis indicated acute phase response, LXR/RXR,
and production of NO, and ROS pathways were upregulated, whereas the
coagulation pathway was downregulated, with HF after MI. The top canonical
pathways identified are listed, ranked by p value
(columns), with the green squares showing the ratio of the number
of pathway proteins identified in glycoproteomic data over the total
number of proteins in that pathway. Multiple-testing-corrected p values were calculated using the Benjamini–Hochberg
method. The threshold line corresponds to a p value
of 0.05.

Partial least squares discriminate
analysis also linked glycosylated
Apo F, transthyretin, Apo C4, prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase, complement
C9, and CD59 to the post-MI development of HF because the important
feature scores were high for all six (Figure 2A). Apo F, Apo C4, transthyretin, and prostaglandin-D2
synthase are linked to metabolic disease (specifically, to lipid metabolism),
whereas C9 and CD59 are associated with inflammation. The increase
in lipid metabolism is consistent with animal studies that have shown
upregulation of cardiac lipid metabolism is an initiator stimulus
for HF development.15 CD59 regulates complement
activation by preventing C9 from polymerizing and forming the complement
membrane attack complex.16

Figure 2 Bioinformatic analysis
identified six candidates predictive of
HF. (A) PLSDA linked upregulation of apolipoprotein (Apo) F, transthyretin,
Apo C4, prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase, and complement C9 and downregulation
of CD59 to the development of post-MI HF. (B) Transthyretin and CD59
associated with elevated levels of hemoglobin A1C. VIP—important
feature.

Of the six glycosylated proteins
that were differentially expressed,
transthyretin and CD59 were associated with elevated levels of hemoglobin
A1C (Figure 2B). As
CD59 inhibits complement activation, CD59 upregulation would protect
cells from complement-mediated damage and stimulate inflammation resolution.16 The reduction of CD59 in the setting of diabetes
provides a mechanism to dampen resolution and stimulate the development
of HF. Optimal post-MI maintenance requires mechanisms that continually
prevent inflammation by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines, stimulating
the clearance of inflammatory cells, and promoting ECM homeostasis
to maintain a stable scar.17−22 In congestive HF, inflammation and ECM turnover is a major determinant
of progressive cardiac remodeling,23 and
metabolic alterations and immune-regulated ECM turnover are closely
linked with HF progression.24 Our results
suggest cross-talk between metabolism and immunity instigating the
progression to HF, especially in participants with diabetes.

Participants who developed HF had a higher prevalence of metabolic
disease. Of the participants enrolled, 45% (27/60) were diagnosed
with diabetes. Of the participants later hospitalized with HF, 80%
(12/15) were diagnosed with diabetes compared to 38% (17/45) who did
not progress to HF. MI subjects who developed HF did not have well-controlled
glucose levels, as evidenced by higher hemoglobin A1C (Table 1).

Online Mendelian Inheritance
in Man (OMIM) disease analysis indicated
that complement deficiency
and macular degeneration were linked with the proteins identified
in the glycoproteomic screen.25 In particular,
CD59, C3, and C9 were associated with complement deficiency, whereas
C3 and Apo F were associated with macular degeneration. Interestingly,
Cheng and colleagues have reported a link between macular degeneration
and increased incidence of both MI and HF (Table 4).26 Complement
component 3 has been shown to be necessary to preserve post-MI myocardium
and myocardial physiology.27

a In the OMIM disease compendium,
complement deficiency and macular degeneration were most linked with
the proteins identified in the glycoproteomic screen.25

Apo F Predicted the Development
of HF
When stratified
by age, sex, and time interval between MI and plasma collection, Apo
F was strongly associated with an increased risk for HF (OR 21.84,
95% CI 3.20–149.14; Figure 3A). In addition, intercellular adhesion molecule 1
(ICAM1; OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.001–0.334) and leucine-rich repeat
neuronal 2 (LRRN2) protein (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25–0.98) were
associated with protection from the development of HF. After adjustment,
transthyretin, ApoC4, prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase, complement C9,
and CD59 were no longer significant. Apo F was identified as a candidate
biomarker for HF by both important feature analysis and by adjusted
analysis. Apo F, an LXR/RXR pathway member, is also known as lipid
transfer inhibitor protein for its ability to inhibit lipid transfer
between lipoproteins.28 From our results,
Apo F may also play a previously unidentified role in inflammation
regulation.

Figure 3 Apo F identified as the strongest biomarker for HF. (A) When stratified
by age, sex, and time interval between MI and plasma collection, Apo
F was associated with increased risk, and ICAM1 and LRRN2 were associated
with decreased risk from the development of HF. (B) Apo F and (C)
CD59 alone were strong predictors for HF compared to (D) all eight
proteins combined (Apo F, transthyretin, Apo C4, prostaglandin-H2
D-isomerase, complement C9, CD59, ICAM1, and LRRN2).

Plasma glycoproteins identified were analyzed for
predictability
of the development of HF following MI. Receiver operating characteristic
analysis identified that all eight markers detected by either important
feature analysis (Apo F, transthyretin, ApoC4, prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase,
complement C9, and CD59) or adjusted analysis (ICAM1 and LRRN2) could
predict the development of HF. Interestingly, Apo F and CD59 alone
were stronger predictors for HF compared to all eight markers together,
and Apo F was the strongest individual predictor for HF (Figure 3C–E). Neither
IL-6 (AUC = 0.558; p = 0.516) or IL-6 receptor (AUC
= 0.629; p = 0.147), which are known biomarkers for
HF,29 were as powerful predictors as Apo
F.

Apo F is a protein associated with both the acute phase response
and with the LXR/RXR pathway and regulates macrophage physiology through
mechanisms not fully understood. Apo F forms plasma membrane complexes
with lipoproteins, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density
lipoprotein (HDL), to facilitate the uptake or esterification of cholesterol.30 Changes in these lipoprotein complexes promote
inflammatory cell conversion from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory
phenotype or vice versa.31,32 This in turn could
lead to prolonged inflammation to enable the development of congestive
HF. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) indicated that Apo F was an upstream
regulator in the LXR/RXR pathway linked to changes in the immune response
(Figure 4). The macrophage
arm of the LXR/RXR pathway, therefore, may be vital for the post-MI
progression to HF.

Figure 4 Macrophage arm of the LXR/RXR pathway is linked to the
development
of HF. Apo F regulates this process by binding to LDL and HDL, thus
changing cell membrane lipoprotein complexes and facilitating inflammatory
cell activation.

Conclusions
The
goal of this study was to identify protein candidates in plasma
samples from post-MI JHS participants that predicted future progression
to HF. The three most salient findings were (1) Apo F was identified
as a strong predictor for future HF development; (2) upregulation
of the acute phase response and LXR/RXR signaling pathways and downregulation
of the coagulation system associated with later HF; and (3) regulation
of inflammation by metabolic pathways may be key in HF development.
Participants who were diagnosed with HF before visit 2 were not included
in this analysis to identify early markers of future HF. Our results
indicate that participants with metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes)
as a comorbidity had a higher risk of HF development, most likely
because of enhanced and prolonged inflammation leading to adverse
remodeling.

Apo F is a glycosylated protein highly expressed
by the liver and
secreted into the circulation where it attaches to lipoproteins.33 Apo F prefers binding to LDL over HDL, and binding
to LDL inhibits its ability to transfer lipids.34 Whether glycosylation of Apo F affects lipid binding is
not known. Future studies should be performed evaluating whether alterations
to Apo F glycosylation status affect protein function and risk of
developing HF. LDL also coordinates the activation of inflammatory
and apoptotic responses in leukocytes.35 Overexpression of Apo F reduces HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in
mice by increasing the clearance of HDL-C esterase in macrophages.36 This is thought to play a role in polarizing
inflammatory cells, specifically macrophages, from proinflammatory
to anti-inflammatory phenotypes.31,32 Although elevated
HDL-C associates with improved CVD outcomes,37 in patients with chronic disease such as diabetes, HDL undergoes
structural modifications that can promote and prolong inflammation.32,38,39 Some of the same pathways, therefore,
may be activated in opposite directions in the setting of comorbidities.

Nonenzymatic glycation of apolipoproteins is involved in the pathogenesis
of vascular complications of metabolic diseases including diabetes.
For example, glycosylation of ApoA-IV is associated with coronary
artery disease severity in patients with type-2 diabetes by increasing
the proinflammatory response through the nuclear receptor NR4A3.40 Similarly, IgG glycosylation associates with
CVD risk possibly through direct interaction with Fcγ receptors
and complement.41,42 In addition, Mayr and colleagues
showed a strong association between very-LDL-associated apolipoproteins
including C-II, C-III, and E with incident CVD similar to what we
observed in our study.43 Although our study
did not assess the glycosylation status of the identified proteins,
future studies evaluating the effect of diabetes on protein glycosylation
is required to understand their role in HF development. In the current
guidelines for HF, natriuretic peptides are the recommended biomarker
to aid with the diagnosis.1 Further comparison
of the proteins identified in our study with more common biomarkers
such as natriuretic peptides, C-reactive protein, and cardiac troponins
are needed to comparatively weigh and rank different biomarkers that
have been proposed. Combining biomarkers into composite scores will
also provide further discriminatory capabilities.

Glycoproteomic
evaluation of JHS samples served as a hypothesis-generating
analysis to identify possible markers for HF. Additional studies that
provide insight into the mechanisms behind Apo F regulation of lipoproteins
and how glycosylation of Apo F affects inflammatory mechanisms are
warranted. Studies delineating the connection between macular degeneration
and HF development and mechanistic investigations exploring the role
of Apo F in mediating macrophage proinflammatory signaling would also
be informative.

Limitations to this study include small sample
size and the glycoproteome
was evaluated at a single time point, which varied in its temporal
relation between MI and onset of HF across the cohort. Because of
the small sample size, we had to limit the number of covariates assessed.
Future studies with a larger sample size would be necessary to adjust
for other important variables such as BMI, diabetes, and smoking status.
Comparison of our findings with additional ethnicities/races, regions/countries,
and ages will be needed to fully understand the efficacy of the proteins
identified. In addition, future studies using serial samples are needed
to understand the dynamic nature of the proteome. We have recently
reported that LXR/RXR signaling and neutrophil phenotype following
MI distinguish sex differences in remodeling, using this same cohort.44

In conclusion, glycosylated Apo F was
the strongest predictor of
future HF identified in post-MI plasma samples. Our data suggest that
the increase in Apo F may facilitate HF development by extending the
inflammatory response after MI.

Materials and Methods
Jackson
Heart Study
JHS is a community-based cohort
study that includes 5306 noninstitutionalized African American participants
who were 21 to 94 years old at the time of enrollment and all residing
in the Jackson, MS area. JHS sampled from urban and rural areas surrounding
Jackson, MS, included representation from three metropolitan counties
(Hinds, Madison, and Rankin). Participants were residents, volunteers,
randomly selected individuals, and secondary family members of enrolled
participants.45

The analysis included
60 participants diagnosed with MI before visit 2 (2005–2008),
who had not been hospitalized with HF prior to the visit, and for
whom informed consent was obtained for ancillary studies. JHS was
approved by the institutional review board of the University of Mississippi
Medical Center, and all participants provided written informed consent
under IRB protocol #2014-0274. All participants that fit the criteria
were included in this study. Later, HF events were formally adjudicated
by JHS from 2005 to 2012. Participants were divided into two groups:
(1) those who did not develop HF by 2013 (MI; n =
45) and (2) those who were hospitalized after 2009 with HF (MI + HF; n = 15). Classification of HF was based on the following:
(1) Framingham criteria equal “HF present”, NHANES criteria
equal “HF present”, and modified Boston criteria equal
“definite or possible HF” and (2) Morbidity and Mortality
Classification Committee (MMCC) HF classification is “chronic
stable HF” or “no HF”. Two physician reviews
were required for HF classification. If there was a disagreement in
classification, a third adjudicator physician review was performed
and that diagnosis was used. The time between MI and plasma collection
was 6 ± 5 years (median = 4 years; time interval = 1–17
years). We previously evaluated this cohort for sex differences in
remodeling.44

Electrocardiogram Analysis
Standard 12-lead electrocardiogram
(ECG) measurements were recorded at visit 3 to evaluate if glycopeptides
at visit 2 predicted ECG changes at visit 3. Average QT interval was
corrected for the heart rate using the Bazett formula (QTc = QT/√RR).

Plasma Glycoproteomics
The glycopeptide capture method
was used to enrich for extracellular proteins that had glycosylation
sites; we did not evaluate the status of glycosylation. Plasma glycopeptides
were isolated label-free and captured by the solid-phase extraction
of glycopeptides method, as previously described.10,14,46,47 Plasma proteins
were reduced, alkylated, and trypsin-digested into peptides.10,14,47 The trypsinized peptide mixture
was oxidized and covalently conjugated to a solid support via hydrazide
chemistry, and glycopeptides were N-linked to the column and released
using PNGase F treatment. The released peptides were prepared using
Sep-Pak Vac C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and analyzed by liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using a Q Exactive (ThermoFisher,
Waltham, MA) together with a 15 cm × 75 μm C18 column (5
μm particles with 100 Å pore size). A target value of 1
× 106 ions at a resolution setting of 70 000
was set and 1 × 105 ions at a resolution setting of
17 500 in MS2.

SEQUEST was searched for MS/MS spectra
using Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4; Thermo Fisher) against the
human RefSeq database (November 3, 2013 version) containing 53 918
sequences. To exclude low-probability protein identifications, the
false discovery rate was set at 0.01. Spectral counting was used for
peptide quantification, and total spectral counts for each sample
were used for normalization. Missing values were replaced with 0.01
to calculate the ratio and p value. Samples were
run in duplicate, and the results were combined for analysis. A total
of 88 proteins were identified, of which 41% (36 proteins) were found
in both runs. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited
to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository
with the dataset identifier PXD009870 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/).48

Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed according
to the guidelines for antibody use in cardiovascular research.49 Validation of glycoproteomic data was performed
by regression analysis comparing mass spectroscopy peak intensity
values to densitometry of protein measured by immunoblotting and normalized
to the intensity of the total membrane stain (Table S1 and Figure S1). Samples
were volume-loaded and separated on 4–12% Criterion XT Bis-Tris
gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad),
and stained with MemCode Reversible Protein Stain Kit (Thermo Scientific)
to verify the protein concentration and loading accuracy. Membranes
were blocked with 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad), followed by overnight
incubation with primary antibody [polymeric immunoglobulin receptor
(Abcam ab96196; 1:1000), complement C9 (Abcam ab173302; 1:1000), Apo
F (Raybiotech 102-10552; 1:250), and CD59 (Abcam ab124396; 1:1000)],
followed by secondary antibody (anti-rabbit Vector PI-1000; 1:5000)
and detection with ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Substrate
(Amersham).

IL6 and IL6R ELISA
IL6 and IL6R
plasma concentrations
were measured using human IL6 (Novus; NBP2-31051) and IL6R (Novus;
NBP1-89870) ELISA kits, according to manufacturer instructions.

Statistics and Bioinformatics
Statistics are reported
according to the guidelines, statistical considerations in reporting
cardiovascular research.50 Data are presented
as mean ± SD, and all data acquisition and statistical analyses
were performed by investigators blinded to groups. The analysis of
this study compared MI and MI + HF groups; as such, two group comparisons
were analyzed by Students t-test. A statistical significance
was set at p < 0.05 (two-sided).

A model
was developed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of HF associated with
the identified glycoproteins. Logistic regression analyses were used
to evaluate associations between plasma glycoprotein markers and HF
development after MI in univariate and multivariable models, adjusting
for age, sex, and time between MI and plasma collection. Receiver
operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed
in GraphPad Prism 7, for the eight individual proteins identified
as being significantly different between groups and for a composite
assessment of all eight proteins combined.

For data visualization,
heat maps were constructed using an online
statistical tool provided in the Metaboanalyst 3.0 package (www.metaboanalyst.ca/).51,52 Signaling pathways were visualized using partial least squares discriminant
analysis (PLSDA) and canonical analysis in IPA; (QIAGEN, Redwood City; www.qiagen.com/ingenuity). For IPA, MI + HF glycoproteomic data were normalized to MI-only
datasets, to focus on pathways responsible for HF development and
not in response to MI. Multiple-testing corrected p values were calculated using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.53

protein quantification correlated with peak intensity of proteins
identified by mass spectrometry and showed a positive relationship
between the two methods; glycoproteomic results: values for individual
samples are intensity units of the peptides; definition of terms:
Xcorr—peptide score, m/z [Da]—mass/charge,
and RT (min)—retention time; immunoblotting of top six proteins
