Electricity
generation from coal, nuclear reaction, and shale gas
has brought environmental, safety, and health concerns. The electricity
industry is constantly seeking sustainable, safe, and healthy way
of electricity generation. The use of triboelectric device is promising
for producing electricity from water energy. In this study, we report
on the rapid fabrication of a 1,3-phosphorylated poly(vinyl alcohol)
gel-based triboelectric device and direct harvesting of water turbulence
energy using this device. The gel was prepared by the reaction of
poly(vinyl alcohol) with dipotassium phosphate. The synthesized gel
was characterized by mass spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis/difference
thermogravimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, Raman, and carbon and
oxygen K-edges soft X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy.

1 Introduction
Coal is one of the most affordable and largest generated sources
of electricity. The burning of coal brings many environmental issues,
such as air and water pollution. Also, the access to coal is restricted
in a global scale. This issue plus the concern of increased carbon
production are driving factors behind the development of new materials
and technology for clean energy. Nuclear power that generates electricity
through nuclear reaction has been considered as a sustainable and
clean energy. However, the well-known nuclear power station accident,
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster that happened in Japan in 2011,
has brought safety concern about the development of nuclear power.
Shale gas, the extraction of natural gas from shale rock formations,
has transformed the energy landscape in many countries. The development
of shale gas extraction was considered as an effective way to cope
with the growing electricity demand while reducing the dependence
on coal. However, the extraction of shale gas has brought concerns,
such as water pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and detrimental
health impacts. It indicates that the electricity industry has to
continue to develop safe, sustainable, and healthy way of generating
electricity.

Triboelectric devices are novel energy converters
that convert
mechanical energy into electrical energy. Triboelectric devices hold
the merits of low weight, low fabrication cost, self-power, enforced
green technology, orientation to clean energy, and resource abundance.1 The triboelectric devices were invented by Wang
and co-worker in January 2012.2 Since their
birth, research interest in seeking simple fabrication and new materials
system for triboelectric devices is growing,3 which shows the great potential for solving the issue of electrical
power shortage in developing countries, electrical power-limited regions,
and rural areas. Wang and co-workers3 proposed
the use of triboelectric devices to harvest the mechanical energy
from ocean. It was called blue energy, including that from tidal,
water wave, and ocean current.3

Following
this trend, polymer-based materials system can be one
of the answers to this demand. The polymer is generally dielectric
material, which is easily used for building up triboelectric power
on the device surface. However, no specific polymer has been proposed
as the standard raw material for making triboelectric devices so far.
Efforts are still required for searching new polymer sample for specific
triboelectric application.

Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a nontoxic,
slowly biodegradable polymer
that is widely used in paper industry. Also, it is water-soluble,
which makes it much more convenient and cheaper to be processed compared
to other polymers only dissolved in organic solvents. We aimed to
tailor it by using some nontoxic compound and use PVA-based materials
for making triboelectric devices.

Extensive research endeavor
over the past 5 years has led to progress
and development for triboelectric devices, which have been applied
to various sources, including human motion,4 mechanical vibration,5 automobile brake,6 wind,7 rotation,8 water waves,9 and
tides.10 However, new application of triboelectric
devices toward large-scale energy harvesting remains an important
task.

Turbulence is commonly observed in any flow system, such
as reservoirs,
rivers, lakes, and oceans. Especially, oceans cover more than 70%
of the earth’s surface and are exceedingly rich resources for
turbulence. However, current study of triboelectric devices for ocean
energy harvesting is focused on water waves/tides energy, referring
to the kinetic and potential energy from ocean surface waves. To the
best of our knowledge, there are no reports about triboelectric devices
for water turbulence harvesting.

Here, we report on rapid fabrication
of a 1,3-phosphorylated poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PPVA) gel-based triboelectric device and direct harvesting
of water turbulence energy using this device. PPVA gel was prepared
by the reaction of PVA with dipotassium phosphate, a nontoxic compound
widely used in food industry as a food additive. The synthesized PPVA
was characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), mass spectroscopy,
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)/difference thermogravimetry (DTG),
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and soft X-ray absorption
near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) of carbon K-edge, oxygen
K-edge. The PPVA gel was mixed with silica powder for making a triboelectric
device. We found that the electrical current output of the triboelectric
device was dependent on the magnitude of the flow speed of water turbulence.
Due to the simple chemistry, facile fabrication, and exceptional performance,
the PPVA-based triboelectric device is envisioned to play a significant
role in many low-cost and rapidly processed water/blue energy harvesting
applications.

2 Results and Discussion
To synthesize the PPVA gel, dipotassium phosphate (20 g) was first
mixed with ultrapure water (200 mL) in a 500 mL beaker and stirred.
After a clear solution was obtained, PVA (15 g) was added to the beaker.
Heating at 80 °C temperature was applied to the beaker. After
stirring the mixture for 15 min, a clear and soft gel was obtained.
The gel was washed with ultrapure water 10 times and stored for further
characterization. It should be mentioned that in the stirring process,
normal magnetic stirrer was not workable given that the gel emerging
in the solution from the very beginning was very sticky. To overcome
this difficulty, we used a Teflon rod (length = 15 cm) driven by a
Worm Gear Direct Current (DC) motor with the rated torque of 21 kg
cm to stir the gel. A proposed synthesis scheme for PPVA is shown
in Scheme 1. The structure
of PPVA is similar to that of Pupkevich’s work.11 The surface morphology of the synthesized gel
was characterized by the SEM (Figure 1). Interestingly, the synthesized gel surface shows
a nanopillar feature (Figure 1c).

gel with different imaging scale: (a) 500 μm; (b) 5 μm;
and (c) 100 nm.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Phosphorylated
Poly(vinyl alcohol) Gel
Polymer chemistry of PPVA can be studied by mass spectra
(Figure 2a), TGA curve,
and
DTG curve (Figure 2b). As proposed by Hanton,12 the molecular
weight distribution is determined by the number-average molecular
weight, MN, the weight average molecular
weight, MW, and the polydispersity ≅ MW/MN. The two average
molecular weights are the first two moments of the distribution of
oligomer molecules.12 Using this method,
these parameters can be calculated as: MN = 5487.076, MW = 7593.756, and polydispersity
= 1.384.

Figure 2 (a) Mass spectra of phosphorylated poly(vinyl alcohol). (b) The
TGA/DTG curves of phosphorylated poly(vinyl alcohol).

The TGA and DTG curves are shown in Figure 2b. The weight loss at 50–150
°C
is due to moisture vaporization. The weight loss at 250–350
°C is due to the degradation of the PPVA molecule. The weight
loss at 350–450 °C is possibly due to the byproduct generated
by PPVA during the TGA thermal degradation process. The DTG curve
shows three peaks at 143, 321, and 431 °C.

Soft X-ray absorption
spectroscopy, a complementary technique to
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, unravels the electronic structure
of the materials by elucidating the local electronic structure and
bonding. We exploited the XANES of carbon and oxygen K-edge absorption
measurement to probe the electronic bonding and structure of the PPVA
sample. Figure 3 shows
the carbon K-edge absorption spectroscopy of the PPVA film formed
on the gold-sputtered silicon wafer substrate. For comparison, the
carbon K-edge XANES spectrum of graphite and PVA are presented in Figure 3. The graphite spectrum
exhibits peaks at 285.4 eV (π*), 291.8 eV (σ*), 292.9
eV (σ*), 297.9 eV (σ*), 303.7 eV (σ*), and 307.8
eV and a shoulder at 319–336 eV. The PVA spectrum presents
peaks at 287.5, 292.6, 294.6, and 299.5 eV and a shoulder at 307.2
eV.

Figure 3 Carbon K-edge XANES spectra of graphite, poly(vinyl alcohol) and
phosphorylated poly(vinyl alcohol) samples.

For PPVA, the carbon K-edge XANES spectra show peaks at 284.5,
288. 8, 293, 297.5, and 300.3 eV. Two distinctive peaks, which are
also observed in the absorption spectrum of the graphite, are the
resonances due to the transitions from C 1s electron state to π*
and σ* states. These features have sp2 bonding characteristics
and appear at 284.5 eV (π*) and 293 eV (σ*) excitation
energies for PPVA in Figure 3. The broad peak centred at 293 eV photon energy embeds σ*(C–O)
resonance as well. The shoulder located at the left side of this peak
at 292 eV is attributed to the σ* resonance of the (C–C)
bond.13,14 The strong absorption peak between sp2-derived π* and σ* resonances emerges from transitions
from C (1s) state to the unoccupied state of carbon that functionalized
with oxygen. Concomitant with the XPS results detailed below, it is
determined that this prominent peak with 289 eV excitation energy
in the PPVA absorption spectrum is a band depicting C (1s) →π*(C=O)
transition. The C 1s XPS spectrum also confirms the formation of C=O
bond, shown in Figure 5. Both absorption and excitation energies of this bond indicate that
the bond is a part of carboxyl (COOH) functional group. Note that
there exists a shoulder at the middle intensity of this peak with
a 288 eV excitation energy. We assign this absorption feature to σ*(C–H)
resonance. Two sharp absorption peaks residing at higher photon energies
around 300 eV in the spectrum are identified as L-edge transition
of potassium in the PPVA sample. The peaks at 297.5 and 300.3 eV are
transitions from 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 electronic
states of potassium. These absorption energies of the L-edge peaks
are higher than those of reported as around 294 and 297 eV.15 However, it has been also published that if
potassium involves in a strong ionic bonding, it results in an L-edge
absorption energies shift as much as 3 eV.14,16 Moreover, we assign the peak above the potassium L-edge features,
appearing as a broad band around 303 eV as a σ*(C=O)
resonance.17

The oxygen K-edge XANES
spectra (Figure 4)
was also used to investigate the nature
of oxygen bonding in the sample. For the PPVA sample, we observe two
distinctive features in the O K-edge XANES spectra at 531.4 eV and
537 eV and a shoulder around 550–580 eV. The peak at 531.4
eV is a transition from oxygen 1s electronic state to π*(C=O)
unoccupied state. The main peak at 536 eV is attributed to σ*(C–OH)
and (C–O–C) bonds, as indicated from the O 1s XPS spectra
of the sample (Figure 5c). We think the shoulder residing at 539.7
eV photon energy stems from an oxygen 1s electron transition to σ*(C=O)
bond, which is shown in the O 1s XPS spectra (Figure 5c). It has been documented that oxygen K-edge
absorption spectrum discloses σ*(P–O) resonance at 535
eV;18 we believe that the shoulder at this
absorption energy in Figure 6 has a contribution from the (P–O) bond.19 The shoulder around 550–580 eV can be
assigned to the transition from O (2p) to the defect state of the
sample. Compared to the oxygen K-edge absorption spectrum of PPVA,
that of PVA showed two peaks at 531.8 and 537.1 eV and a shoulder
around 550–580 eV. The spectroscopic meaning of the peaks at
531.8 and 537.1 eV for PVA is similar to the peaks at 531.4 and 537
eV for PPVA. The peak at 531.8 eV for PVA represented oxygen 1s electronic
state to π*(C=O) unoccupied state. The peak at 537.1
eV for PVA is assigned to the resonance of σ*(C–OH) and
(C–O–C) bonds. We speculated that the shifting of the
photon energy and the change in the intensity for the peaks of PPVA
were due to the introduction of P–O resonance.

The XPS scans in Figure 5 show the expected C 1s, O
1s, and P 2p peaks. The synthesized
XPS profile of C 1s presented three peaks at 284.5, 285.9, and 288.9
eV, which are attributable to the C–H, C–O–C,
and carboxylate −COO species.20 The
synthesized XPS profile of O 1s showed three peaks at 531.5, 532.2,
and 532.9 eV, which are assigned to phosphate,21 C=O,22 and C–O–C/C–OH.22

The synthesized XPS profile of P 2p showed
a peak at 133.6 eV,
which is attributed to phosphate.21 The
XPS survey (Figure 5a) was employed to find out qualification of the element. As shown
in Table 1, C 1s shows
the highest atomic percent and P 2p shows the lowest atomic percent.

at 835. 9, 911.1, 1085.3, 1243.1, 1325.0, 1419.4, 1574, 1741, 2912.

of PPVA showed much sharper peaks at 520, 938, 1080, 1259, 1382, 1426,
1656, 1713, 2941, and 3276 cm–1. The peak at 520
cm–1 is attributed to the in-plane vibration of
the C–C=O group.23 The weak
peak at 938 cm–1 is due to the C–C stretching.24 The peak at 1080 cm–1 is assigned
to the P–O– groups.24 The
peak at 1259 cm–1 is attributed to the P=O
double bonds.24 The peak at 2941 cm–1 is assigned to C–H stretching.24 The peak at 3276 cm–1 is assigned
to O–H stretching.25

1449, 1500, 2433, 2738, and 2931 cm–1 and a shoulder
at 1655 cm–1. The band at 428 cm–1 is due to the P(OH)2 bend.26 The band at 1086 cm–1 is assigned to C–H
vibration.23 The band at 642 cm–1 is attributed to O–C=O in-plane bending mode.23 The band at 923 cm–1 is due
to the C–C stretching. The band at 2931 cm–1 is attributed to C–H vibration.23 The band at 1449 cm–1 is assigned to the mixture
of C–H bending and O–H bending.27

A triboelectric device was rapidly fabricated by using the
synthesized
PPVA gel (Figure 7a).
First, three different kinds of dielectric materials were made by
mixing PPVA gel with varied wt % of silica powder, which were pure
PPVA gel, 9 wt % silica-filled PPVA gel, and 15 wt % silica-filled
PPVA gel. Then, they were put inside a plastic bag, which was set
under a heavy iron cylinder. A man was standing above the cylinder.
The weight of his body (165 lbs) would be used to press the PPVA gel
into a slide. The thickness of the slides made was around 1 mm. Finally,
the triboelectric device was made by the origami of the slides.

Figure 7 (a) Configuration
of the phosphorylated poly(vinyl alcohol)-based
module for water turbulence energy harvesting. Here, the bulks with
different color represented different phosphorylated poly(vinyl alcohol)-based
layers filled with certain amount of silica powder. Light blue layer:
9 wt % silica filled. Green layer: No silica filled. Pink: 15 wt %
silica filled. A bridge rectifier was wired for alternating current
(AC) to direct current (DC) conversion. A microampere meter was used
for monitoring the electrical current generated when this module was
pressed by water flow. (b) The image of a triboelectric device with
a 1,3-phosphorylated poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer for water turbulence
energy harvesting.

As presented in Figure 7a, the light-blue
layer represented the PPVA gel filled with
9 wt % silica; the green layer indicated a pure PPVA gel without filling
any silica; the pink layer represented PPVA gel filled with 15 wt
% silica. It should be noted that the weight of the silica powder
used in the device was carefully chosen and optimized. Filling too
much silica powder into the PPVA gel would make it very stiff, causing
much difficulty in the continued material processing, such as mixing,
stirring and slide-pressing, bending, and origami-construction. Also,
introducing too much silica powder into the PPVA gel would lead to
the increase in the electrical resistance of the whole device, which
made the electrical current undetectable with a microamperemeter. Figure 7b presents the actual
image of the triboelectric device made.

The electrical current
was expected to be generated when external
pressure was applied to this triboelectric device. A commercial bridge
rectifier (model: KBP307) was connected to the device for AC-to-DC
convention. A microampere meter was wired to monitor the change in
the electrical current. A silver paste was used for electric contact.
To generate water turbulence, turbine blades were self-developed.
First, commercial 1 feet by 2 feet, 22 gauge weldable steel sheet
(model: M-D Building Products 56066) were cut into small rectangular
steel sheets (dimension: 1.5 cm by 6 cm) and a round steel sheet (diameter:
8.5 cm). Those small rectangular sheets were bent and soldered on
the surface of the round steel sheets using an ordinary 60 W electronic
soldering iron kit.

A Worm Gear DC motor (rated torque 21 kg
cm) with a speed controller
was purchased from Amazon. Then, one end of an iron rod (length: 10
cm, diameter: 4 mm) was soldered to the DC motor and anther end of
the rod was soldered to the turbine blades. It should be mentioned
that all the soldering in the operation was done by the electronic
soldering iron kit, which was convenient for laboratory operation.
These turbine blades were driven by the DC motor (Figure 8c) and placed inside a tank
of water to generate a turbulence flow. A flow sensor was employed
to measure the flow speed of the water turbulence. The flow speed
of the water turbulence was adjusted through the speed controller
of the DC motor. A tank of Milli-Q water (5 gallon) was prepared.
The triboelectric device fabricated was placed inside the water tank
to harvest the triboelectric current where the water turbulence was
constantly hitting the triboelectric device.

Figure 8 (a) A man was standing
above an iron cylinder, whose body weight
would be used to press the phosphorylated poly(vinyl alcohol) gel
into a slide. The phosphorylated poly(vinyl alcohol) gel was put inside
a plastic bag and set under an iron cylinder. (b) The iron cylinder
(diameter: 8 cm, thickness: 3.5 cm) was used (the one in (b). (c)
Blades were made to generate water turbulence. Here, the blades were
connected with a DC motor. By controlling the speed of the DC motor,
we could generate the water turbulence with various speeds.

As shown in Figure 9a, the current harvested was dependent on
the flow speed of the water
turbulence. This indicated that the fabricated PPVA-based triboelectric
device could be used as a prototype for harvesting water turbulence
energy. When two different layers of dielectric materials were in
close contact, the electric current would be generated. This triboelectric
effect has been well known for decades, which was called as triboelectrification.
However, a full-scale debate is still under way on what makes it happen.28 It has been proposed that energy level misalignment,
ion transfer, and/or materials species transfer could result in electron
charging.28

Figure 9 (a) Electrical current
generated depended on the water flow velocity.
(b) Diagram showing the formation of the electrical polarization P1 and P2. Here, P1 was the electrical polarization between the
blue and green layers, whereas P2 was
the electrical polarization between the green and pink layer.

In the following, we derived a
simple mechanism to explain the
phenomena that the triboelectric current generation depended on the
flow speed of the water turbulence based on the fabricated triboelectric
device.

We considered that it was due to the interaction of
electrical
polarization of the dielectric layers. Figure 9b indicates the formation of electrical polarization
on the surface between dielectric layers. When water turbulence hit
the triboelectric device, the device was pressed. In this process,
the dielectric layers were squeezed to generate electric charge, leading
to the formation of P1 and P2. Here, P1 was the electrical
polarization between the blue and green layers, whereas P2 was the electrical polarization between the green and
pink layers. The final polarization for electric current generation
was P1–P2 or P2–P1. When the water turbulence moved away from the triboelectric
device, the whole device was released. The electrical polarization
disappeared. But when it was hit by water turbulence, electrical polarization
was produced again. If the water turbulence hit the device at a higher
speed, a bigger electrical polarization could be expected, given that
much more areas of the dielectric layers were squeezed and much more
electric charges were generated. That is the reason why the higher
speed of the water turbulence speed would lead to a higher triboelectric
current (Figure 9a).

It should be noted that we used ultrapure water for this proof-of-concept
experiment in laboratory with room temperature. However, the performances/stability
of the triboelectric devices are probably affected by salinity, pH
value, temperature, or external environment (e.g., wind with high
speed). For instance, when the triboelectric device is placed inside
sea or river or reservoir for practical application, the change in
salinity, pH value, temperature, and even speed of wind, may bring
some impact on the device. For example, the weight of high-salinity
water may hit the triboelectric device heavily and generate a much
more triboelectric energy compared to that of the low-salinity water
with the same speed; the water with high salinity/high pH value/high
temperature may degrade the device, given that the device was mainly
made by the polymer; the wind with high speed may bring extra triboelectric
energy for the device. The consideration of these impacts is valuable
and paves the way for our future endeavor in the practical application
of the PPVA-based triboelectric device.

3 Conclusions
We synthesized PPVA polymer gel using simple chemistry. The gel
was characterized by mass spectroscopy, TGA/DTG, FTIR, XPS, SEM, Raman,
and carbon and oxygen K-edges XANES. A triboelectric device was fabricated
by folding different layers of dielectric materials made by PPVA/silica.
The triboelectric device was used to harvest water turbulence energy.
In future applications, the triboelectric device can be expected to
be scaled up in a network for large-scale energy harvesting from the
ocean.

XPS, and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the carbon and oxygen
K-edges near edge structure.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
was performed via a TA Instruments Q600 SDT under nitrogen atmosphere
with a 100 mL/min flow rate. Dynamic ramps were performed at the rate
of 10 °C/min from 50 to 750 °C in N2.

Matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (Bruker
UltrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF) was used to study the polymer. The matrix
of cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used.

Raman spectra were
obtained through a Johin Yvon Horiba LABRAM
Integrated Raman spectroscopy system equipped with an HeNe laser (excitation
wavelength: 632.81 nm). The Raman spectra were collected with 0.2
cm–1 resolution in the wavenumber range of 100–3000
cm–1.

The XPS analyses were performed via
a K-Alpha XPS instrument (Thermo
Scientific). The FTIR spectra were collected via a ThermoFisher Nicolet
IS 10 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer equipped with
a Smart iTR diamond ATR accessory and with deuterated-triglycine sulfate
detector. The FTIR spectra collected were average of 32 scans with
4 cm–1 resolution in the wavenumber range of 4000–400

4.3 Soft X-ray Absorption Spectra
of Carbon and
Oxygen
The K-edges near edge structure spectra were obtained
by using a variable-line-space planegrating-monochromator (VLSPGM)
beamline. This beamline facility was constructed by the Center for
Advanced Microstructures and Devices, Louisiana State University,
Baton Rouge, LA. It provides a resolution better than 0.20 eV at the
carbon K-edge. The soft X-ray beamline monochromator that is equipped
with two interchangeable gratings can deliver monochromatic photons
in the energy range of 180–1000 eV. The total electron yield
technique is used for collecting the absorption spectra. The sample’s
drain current was measured with an energy step size of 0.20 eV. A
gold-sputtered mesh was used to acquire primary beam current for spectra
normalization. The base pressure of the vacuum chamber was kept at
2 × 10–9 Torr. A graphite foil was used as
a reference sample to calibrate the energy scale of the grating and
identify the carbon-edge absorption of the sample. The sample was
dried over night on a gold substrate before measurement.
