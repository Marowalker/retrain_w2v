The widespread use
of stimuli-responsive hydrogels is closely related
to their synthesis efficiency. However, the widely used thermal-responsive
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogels usually
require a time-consuming synthesis process to produce (more than 12
h) and exhibit a relatively slow response speed in the field of cryo-polymerization.
In this study, a sequence of thawing polymerization after freezing
polymerization by a two-step method of free radical polymerization
for the efficient synthesis of PNIPAM hydrogels (merely 2 h) with
an excellent comprehensive performance is demonstrated. Results show
that the overall performance of the as-synthesized PNIPAM hydrogels
is at the top level among reported works despite the significantly
reduced preparation time. Moreover, after incorporating multi-walled
carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), the PNIPAM hydrogels exhibit a rapid near-infrared
(NIR) light-response and programmable shape-morphing capability. It
is believed that such a viable and time-saving synthetic method for
producing PNIPAM hydrogels of high performance will lay a solid foundation
for drug delivery and smart actuators.

1 Introduction
Stimuli-responsive
hydrogels are a kind of macromolecule polymers
with three-dimensional network structures. By receiving external environmental
stimuli, such as pH,1 light,2 temperature,3 ionic
strength,4 and electric/magnetic field,5 the hydrogels undertake reconfiguration of a
molecular structure, which can dramatically change their volume or
physicochemical properties. Due to their unique characteristics, the
stimuli-responsive hydrogels show great potential in various applications,
including smart sensors/actuators,6 biomedicine,7 artificial muscles,8 and soft robots,9 which have drawn considerable
interests from both academic and industrial communities. Among stimuli-responsive
hydrogels, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM),
as a typical thermal stimuli-responsive hydrogel, has drawn extensive
attention due to its biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and high water
retention.10 Most importantly, PNIPAM hydrogels
have a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in water of ∼32
°C close to the physiological temperature.11 Upon heating above LCST, PNIPAM chains in a solution possess
an inverse solubility and change from hydrophilic to hydrophobic,
thus undergoing a phase transition from coil to globule to cause a
large volume change.12 However, the volume
change of conventional PNIPAM hydrogels usually exhibits a slow stimuli
response due to the formation of a “dense skin layer”.13 The so-called “dense skin layer”
significantly prevents the out-diffusion of water molecules from the
gel matrix, prolonging the equilibrium swelling and deswelling time
of hydrogel, ranging from a few hours to even a few days.14,15 Such slow responsiveness severely restricts the practical application
of PNIPAM hydrogels and becomes one of the most serious challenges
to be solved.

By far, various methods have been developed to
improve the stimuli-responsive
characteristics of bulky PNIPAM hydrogels, which can be mainly classified
into four categories, including semi-interpenetrating networks (SIPN),16,17 chemical grafting,18,19 porogens,20,21 and nanofillers.14,22 The SIPN method introduces linear
hydrophilic long-chain polymers (e.g., sodium alginate (SA),23 poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA),24 and poly(vinyl-pyrrolidone) (PVP)25) into PNIPAM networks to increase the water release channel, thereby
achieving rapid water diffusivity. The elasticity and swelling ratio
of the PNIPAM hydrogel improve using the SIPN method, but the thermal
response time is still limited to hundreds of seconds.17 The grafting method used to modify the surface
chemical composition and functional groups of original materials is
also utilized to improve the thermal-responsive characteristics of
PNIPAM hydrogels. Studies have shown that PNIPAM hydrogel can improve
its deswelling response by grafting hydrophobic side chains (within
20 min).26 Fast thermal and pH-responsive
hydrogels can be achieved by grafting poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) with PNIPAM chains (within
60 min).27 In addition, the PNIPAM hydrogels
grafted with α-cyclodextrin18 and
poly(vinyl alcohol)formaldehyde (PVF)19 exhibit good biocompatibility, flexibility, and rapid thermal response
(90–200 s). However, this preparation method is relatively
complicated and time consuming, and the as-prepared hydrogels tend
to lack elasticity and fatigue resistance. To eliminate the blocking
effect induced by the dense skin layer, porous microstructures were
adopted to enrich the water transport channels and thereby improve
the thermal responsiveness of hydrogels using porogens, such as cryogenic
solvents20,28 and emulsifiers.21 Among the porogen methods, freezing polymerization is one of the
most effective strategies for preparing porous PNIPAM hydrogels with
a fast response due to its simplicity, convenience, and additive-free
procedure. For example, poly[NIPAM-co-(di-n-propylacrylamide)] P(NIPAM-co-DPAM) hydrogels
prepared by freezing polymerization can achieve rapid swelling and
deswelling.29 However, these porous structures
can also reduce the elasticity of hydrogels, causing collapse of the
porous structure as the volume shrinks, resulting in the blockage
of the water transport channels with a relatively prolonged swelling/deswelling
time in tens of minutes. Moreover, the mass swelling ratio of these
porous hydrogels is relatively small (usually in the range 10–20).
In order to further improve the thermal responsiveness and elasticity
of the hydrogel, various nanofillers, such as silica pellet (SiO2),30−32 tungsten sulfide (WS2) nanosheets,33 polyaniline (PANI),32,34 and titania (TiO2) nanoparticles,35 are added into PNIPAM hydrogels to form hybrid hydrogels
due to their high mechanical properties and good dispersibility. Although
the above methods combining freezing polymerization and the functional
nanofillers can successfully reduce the response time of PNIPAM hydrogels
from dozens of minutes to dozens of seconds,32−34 their production
procedures are usually time consuming (e.g., generally requiring at
least 12 h or even 72 h for the synthesis of PNIPAM hydrogels) with
potential toxicity issues associated with the residual solvent/additives.36 Therefore, there is still lack of a rapid and
cost-effective method to synthesize additive-free PNIPAM hydrogels
with an excellent comprehensive performance, including fast response,
large swelling ratio, low toxicity, and desired mechanical properties.

In this study, we propose a simple two-step method for the efficient
synthesis of additive-free PNIPAM hydrogels. The synthesis of PNIPAM
hydrogels is carried out by freezing polymerization (−20 °C)
at first and then thawing polymerization (4 °C) (denoted as the
FT method), which is contrary to the traditional synthetic methods14,30−32,35 following the sequence
of polymerization (e.g., at 15 °C) first and then freezing step
(denoted as the PF method). The proposed FT method can form a 3D ice
crystal sacrifice skeleton within 1 h at −20 °C, thereby
rapidly forming interconnect porous microstructures in PNIPAM hydrogels
during the thawing polymerization step at 4 °C. As a result,
PNIPAM hydrogels with a high comprehensive performance, that is, fast
response, large swelling ratio (e.g., up to 41), and excellent fatigue
resistance (more than 100 cycles at 80% strain), can be achieved within
2 h, which significantly improves the production efficiency. Moreover,
doping biocompatible multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) offers
the PNIPAM hydrogels exceptional near-infrared (NIR) light responsiveness
for remote controllability. This PNIPAM-MWNT nanocomposite hydrogel
exhibits a fast response and controllable shape-morphing capability
via NIR laser irradiation. The proposed two-step synthesis method
is cost-effective and time saving for the production of high-performance
PNIPAM hydrogels, which is promising for the applications of smart
actuators, biomedicine, and drug delivery.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis Strategy
We synthesize
PNIPAM hydrogels using the rapid two-step method as shown in Figure 1. The method adopts
the two-step sequence of freezing polymerization first at −20
°C, which is performed in a frozen state and then thawing polymerization
at 4 °C. Based on the crystallization theory of the solvent37 and the exothermic reaction of the redox system,
we choose −20 and 4 °C as the experimental temperatures.
In the first step of freezing polymerization, the polymerization rate
of the hydrogel is extremely low due to the low-temperature effect.
Results show that the gel fraction of 1 h freezing polymerization
(step 1) is zero (Table S1, Supporting Information). This phenomenon indicates that the formation of ice crystals is
not hindered by gelation during the first hour of freezing polymerization,
which creates conditions for the porosity of the hydrogel. After 1
h of thawing polymerization (step 2), the gel fraction increases to
66.5% (Table S1), indicating the necessity
of thawing polymerization in our two-step process. Notably, the gel
fraction increases to 57.8% (Table S1)
in 2 h of freezing polymerization (step 1), indicating that gelation
starts in the second hour of freezing polymerization. It can be inferred
that only the chain extension reaction occurred during the first hour
of freezing polymerization without obvious gelation. The relationship
between the polymerization time in the different step and the gel
fraction is shown in Table S1. The conventional
freezing polymerization approach is usually pre-polymerization at
first and then freezing polymerization (PF method). This method has
a small amount of gelation before the formation of ice crystals, so
cross-linking barriers need to be broken during the formation of ice
crystals. And the subsequent low-temperature polymerization takes
more time to form micro-porous hydrogels with a loose pore wall. Therefore,
the whole synthesis process usually requires a relatively long production
time over 12 h, which limits massive applications. In contrast, in
the first step of our FT method,
the aqueous solution of a mixed precursor (containing the monomer N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM); the oxidative involved in
the redox initiator, ammonium persulfate (APS); the reductive component, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-ethylenediamine (TEMED); and the cross-linker, N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (Bis))
is frozen at −20 °C to induce the formation of ice crystals
(Figure 1a,b). In this
step, the monomers in the unfrozen liquid microphase are subjected
to a slow chain extension reaction due to the low activity of the
initiator at −20 °C. The free long chains do not retard
the formation of ice crystals, thereby ensuring the porosity and pore
interconnectivity of the hydrogel network within a short period (merely
1 h) (Figure 1c,d).
In the second step, the rapid thawing polymerization occurs at 4 °C
due to the increased activity of the initiator to form a complete
three-dimensional cross-linked network (Figure 1d,e). During this process, ice crystals melt
to form pores. Therefore, the entire synthesis period of our proposed
two-step method is merely 2 h, which is significantly shorter than
the conventional methods.14,16,17,20,21,23−25,28,31−35,38,39 PNIPAM hydrogels using the FT method (denoted as FT PNIPAM) and
the PF method (denoted as PF PNIPAM) were both prepared for the performance
comparison. The as-prepared hydrogels were stored in water before
use.

monomers thawing polymerize at 4 °C.

2.2 Thermal Responsiveness of FT PNIPAM Hydrogels
The thermal responsiveness of the as-synthesized FT PNIPAM hydrogels
with different polymerization times is shown in Figure 2. PNIPAM hydrogels would undergo a volumetric
shrinkage (Figure 2a inset) when they are heated above LCST (∼32 °C) due
to the coil-globule transition of PNIPAM chains. Our results show
that, with a low concentration of chemical cross-linker Bis (0.2 mg/mL),
the hydrogels exhibit a consistent change in the swelling ratio (SR,
mass ratio), with the SRmax ranging from 37 to 41 (Figure 2a). Although the
polymerization time is greatly shortened, the swelling ratio remains
relatively high in our two-step process. In fact, with the fixing
of a constant dry weight, the FT PNIPAM hydrogel has a larger swelling
ratio than that of the PF method (Figure S1, Supporting Information). For the 2/2 h hydrogel (x/y h refers to freezing polymerization x h and the thawing polymerization y h; see the Experimental Section for details), the thermal-responsive
SR reaches up to >41 below LCST, and the swelling ratio variation
(ΔSR, ΔSR = SRmax – SRmin) also reaches 38 as the temperature increases from 20 to 45 °C,
higher than those of most hydrogels as reported (Figures 2a,d and S1). More remarkably, the FT PNIPAM hydrogels also exhibit
much faster thermal-responsive rates than the PF PNIPAM hydrogels
between 20 and 45 °C (Figures 2b and S2). For example,
at 45 °C the volume of the 2/2 h hydrogel (cylindrical shape
with a diameter of 15 mm and thickness of 3 mm) could shrink 65 and
91.5% just within 10 and 20 s, respectively. For comparison, the PF
PNIPAM requires 40 s to achieve the shrinkage of 71%. And the volume
swelling rate of the 2/2 h FT hydrogel is also very fast; it takes
30 s for the complete volume recovery at 20 °C, in contrast to
220 s of volume recovery for the PF PNIPAM (Figure S2 and Video S1). Moreover, the
volume swelling-deswelling process of the FT PNIPAM hydrogels is highly
reversible and repeatable with the temperature-induced stimulation
cycling between 20 °C (volume swelling) and 45 °C (volume
deswelling) for 10 cycles without obvious decrease (Figure S3). We use the swelling rate (νswell) and deswelling rate (νdeswell) to represent the
thermal response rate of the FT PNIPAM hydrogels. Swelling rate νswell = ΔSR/tswell, where tswell is the full swelling time. Deswelling
rate νdeswell = ΔSR/tdeswell, where tdeswell is the
full swelling time. To the best of our knowledge, the response rate
and the ΔSR value are among the top ones as compared with the
related works using the same cross-linker from the literature (Figure 2c,d).14,16−25,28,31−35,38,39 Moreover, the time required for synthesizing the high-performance
FT PNIPAM hydrogels using our method is the shortest according to
the literature (Figure 2d).14,16,17,20,21,23−25,28,31−35,38,39

2.3 Mechanical
Properties of FT PNIPAM Hydrogels
The additive-free FT PNIPAM
hydrogels also exhibit excellent elasticity
and fatigue resistance (Bis concentration: 0.2 mg/mL). The compression
properties of the fully swollen FT PNIPAM hydrogels (a cylindrical
shape with a diameter of 15 mm and thickness of 15 mm) are shown in Figure 3. The hydrogels have
a large water retention capacity, and even under 80% deformation,
they can recover to their original shape after the stress is released
(Figure 3a), indicating
significantly enhanced mechanical properties compared with PF PNIPAM,
which is fragile and easily broken under a strain over 55% (Figure S4). As for the FT PNIPAM hydrogels prepared
using different polymerization times, they all have a similar elasticity
at 80% strain, but only the corresponding stress is slightly different
(Figure 3b,c). It is
indicated that the FT PNIPAM hydrogels using our two-step FT method
can be synthesized in 2 h without sacrificing their mechanical performance.
Notably, the FT PNIPAM hydrogel can withstand the cyclic compression
of 80% strain more than 100 times. Figure 3d shows that, during the cycle compression
test of the 2/2 h hydrogel, the curves of the first compression and
the last compression (the 100th) are almost coincident, and the stress
value corresponding to 80% strain is stable at around 11 ± 1
kPa (Figure 3d,e).
Notably, the previous work in the literature conducted only 10 cycles
of stress tests33,34 or the non-repetitive tests17,19 for the mechanical performance characterization of as-synthesized
hydrogels. In comparison, we conducted a hundred cyclic stress–strain
tests for the FT hydrogels that remained nearly intact without any
visible structural damage, indicating that the FT PNIPAM hydrogel
has an excellent fatigue resistance and stability. Unfortunately,
our FT hydrogels have weak tensile properties due to the gel’s
porosity. The poor tensile properties could be improved in future
study through a double cross-linking network and the addition of physical
cross-linkers.

and last stress–strain curves of 100 cyclic compression tests

2/2 h hydrogel with respect to the cycle number.

2.4 Morphological Analysis of FT PNIPAM Hydrogels
In order to further explore the polymerization mechanism of our
FT method, we perform scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation
on the hydrogels at the end of the first step (Figure S5) and the second step (Figure S6). At the end of the first step, the SEM images show that
the gelation degree of the FT PNIPAM hydrogel increases with the increase
of the freezing polymerization time. At 2 h of the first step, the
pores in the hydrogel are basically formed, and there are many filaments
between the pores, which are un-cross-linked PNIPAM long chains. At
9 h of the first step, the filaments between the pores are reduced,
and the pore walls piled up. The pore wall structures are basically
formed at 12 h of the first step. However, at the end of the second
step, the prepared FT PNIPAM hydrogels with different polymerization
times all have microscopic porous structures (Figures 4a and S6) due
to the accelerated gelation in the thawing polymerization step (the
second step). For example, the pore size distribution of the PNIPAM
hydrogel with 2/2 h polymerization time ranges from 30 to 60 μm,
and the average pore size is as large as 48 μm (Figure 4b,c). Notably, the average
pore size of FT PNIPAM hydrogels gradually decreases with the increase
of polymerization time due to the increase in gelation. In contrast,
SEM characterization shows that the PF PNIPAM hydrogels have a smaller
pore size and a very low pore interconnection (Figure S7). This is because PNIPAM has partially gelled during
the formation of the ice crystals, and the tight network formed by
the gelation prevents the formation and distribution of ice crystals40−42 in the PF method. Moreover, Figure 4d shows that the hydrogel with 2/2 h polymerization
time has the highest area porosity of 68.4% (the area porosity is
defined as the ratio of the pore size area to the total area). The
average pore size and porosity together determine the water transfer
speed in the hydrogel.

times. (a) SEM image of the freeze-dried 2/2 h PNIPAM hydrogel. (b)

times.

2.5 Performance
Optimization of FT PNIPAM Hydrogels
The concentration effect
of the chemical cross-linker Bis is also
investigated to optimize the performance of FT PNIPAM hydrogels. Figure 5 shows the hydrogel
properties with respect to Bis concentrations. The PNIPAM hydrogels
exhibit a decreased swelling ratio and volume change rate as the Bis
concentration increases (Figures 5a,b and S8). For example,
the SRmax of Bis 0.2 (Bis z refer to the Bis concentration
(mg/mL) of PNIPAM hydrogels) hydrogel is 41.4 and the ΔSR is
38, while the SRmax and ΔSR of the Bis 2.0 hydrogel
are only 21.2 and 16.1, respectively. Besides, the percentages of
volume decrease of the Bis 0.2 hydrogel and Bis 2.0 hydrogel are 91.5
and 72%, respectively. Figure S9 shows
that the increase of Bis concentration leads to a slight decrease
in the pore size and an increase in the thickness of the pore wall
of the FT hydrogel. Notably, there are many small pores in the pore
wall of these hydrogels. This is because of the tiny ice crystals
formed by the water remaining in the pore wall during the freeze-drying
process, leaving many small pores on its surface. Interestingly, this
change in the pore structure only changes the swelling ratio of the
FT hydrogel but has a slight effect on the swelling/deswelling time
(Figure 5a,b). Results
indicate that we can adjust the swelling ratio and volume change percentage
of the hydrogels by changing the Bis concentration but hardly change
the response time. For mechanical properties, the breaking strain
decreases monotonously with the increase of Bis concentration (Figure 5c,d). It is expected
that the cross-linking degree of hydrogels becomes higher with the
increase of Bis concentration, which leads to thicker pore walls and
smaller pores, thus showing increased stress under the same applied
strain. For the 50% strain, the stress value of the hydrogel samples
gradually increases with the increase of Bis concentration (Figure S10). Without particular specification,
0.2 mg/mL Bis and polymerization time 2/2 h were adopted to produce
the optimal FT PNIPAM hydrogel for further experiments.

2.6 Shape Morphing of FT PNIPAM-MWNT Nanocomposite
Hydrogels
Among thermal-responsive hydrogels, rapid NIR light-responsive
hydrogels have received widespread attention from researchers due
to their simplicity, remote control, and shape morphing capability.43,44 These advantages create opportunities for remote manipulation of
smart devices, which is promising in many applications. Generally,
the high response rate is indispensable in many practical applications,
such as NIR light-controlled actuators and soft robots. Therefore,
it is of great significance to develop NIR light-responsive hydrogels
with fast response.

In this work, an excellent NIR light-responsive
hydrogel (Figure 6)
is also developed by the incorporation of MWNTs with the rapid two-step
FT method. When the NIR laser is turned on, the MWNTs absorb the photon
energy of NIR irradiation and locally heat the hydrogel above LCST,
causing the nanocomposite hydrogel to shrink. And when the laser is
turned off, the shrunken volume returns to its original shape quickly
due to water absorption (Figure 6a). In the experiment, the volume of the nanocomposite
hydrogels (cuboid shape with a length of 3.5 mm, width of 7 mm, and
thickness of 1 mm) shrinks ∼84% within 8 s upon exposure to
the NIR radiation (5 W cm–2) and fully recovered
within 8 s upon shutoff of the NIR irradiation (Figure 6b,c). The rapid photo response is also caused
by the porosity of the hydrogels (Figure S11). Moreover, the repeatability of the NIR driven-responsive function
is investigated by exposing the nanocomposite hydrogels under continuously
on and off NIR laser irradiation (power density of 5 W cm–2 and time interval of 8 s). Experimental results show that the NIR
light-responsive behaviors of the as-synthesized PNIPAM-MWNT nanocomposite
hydrogels are highly repeatable (Figure 6d and Video S2).

hydrogels. (a) Schematic illustration of volumetric variation of nanocomposite
hydrogels controlled by NIR laser exposure and removal. (b) Optical

hydrogels under NIR radiation in water. Vt is the volume at time t. V0 is the volume at the equilibrium swollen state.
(d) Repeatability of shrinkage–recovery cycles of nanocomposite
hydrogels under periodic on-off NIR radiation.

Besides the excellent NIR light responsiveness, the PNIPAM-MWNT
nanocomposite hydrogels (denoted as PMNC hydrogels) also possess the
shape-morphing capability with controlled NIR irradiation. Figure 7 shows the controlled
shape-morphing behavior of a single-layer PMNC hydrogel under the
NIR radiation (Figure 7a,b). Upon placement of a cuboid (length of ∼2 cm, width of
∼5 mm, and height of ∼5 mm) PMNC hydrogel in a Petri
dish at room temperature, NIR radiation (5 W cm–2) produces a local volumetric shrinkage along the irradiation direction,
as shown in Figure 7a,b. Moreover, the PMNC hydrogel also exhibits a high responsive
rate of NIR light-responsive behavior, which is among the top level
according to the literature (Figure 7c).33,45−50 The typical shrinkage and recovery time of the PMNC hydrogel are
15 and 8 s, respectively. Furthermore, the deformation direction of
the PMNC hydrogel can be precisely tuned by controlling the irradiation
position of NIR laser (Figure 7a,b, Videos S3 and S4). For example, when irradiating the upper
surface of the PMNC hydrogel, the hydrogel bends upward. Lastly, we
use the hyperelastic gel theory to study large deformations in polymeric
gels subjected to an inhomogeneous swelling caused by external mechanical
loads. For the kinetics of solvent migration, we make use of the similarity
between heat conduction and mass diffusion. Therefore, instead of
reformulating an entirely new user-defined element, we can use the
inbuilt coupled temperature-displacement analysis in ABAQUS for simulation
studies. This analogy significantly reduces the amount of time taken
for the finite element formulation of gel-swelling kinetics. Interestingly,
the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental
results (Figure 7a,b),
further demonstrating that our model can use the programmed hydrogel
structure to guide the design of complex shape-morphing structures.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a cost-effective two-step FT method for the efficient
synthesis of porous PNIPAM hydrogels with fast response, large swelling
ratio, and high fatigue resistance has been successfully developed.
The proposed two-step procedure following the freezing polymerization–thawing
polymerization sequence ensures the porosity and pore interconnectivity
(as opposed to the polymerization-freezing sequence) within a significantly
shorter period (merely 2 h instead of a dozen hours or a few days),
resulting in an enhanced performance of thermal responsiveness and
swelling ratio of the PNIPAM hydrogel. Furthermore, by adding MWNTs,
the PNIPAM hydrogel has shown excellent photo-thermal response characteristics,
which possesses rapid NIR light responsiveness and programmable shape-morphing
capability. The cost-effective and efficient synthesis method for
fabricating high-performance hydrogels is expected to pave a way toward
various potential applications, including drug delivery, bioengineering,
and smart sensing.

g), APS (2 mg/mL, 10 mg), and variable Bis (1–10 mg) were dissolved
in deionized water (5 mL) to obtain a homogeneous solution in an ice
bath. And the mixture was followed by deoxygenation with N2 (99.99%) for 10 min; then, TEMED (10 μL) was added under vigorous
stirring at 0 °C for 30 s. Next, the mixed solution was quickly
transferred to a refrigerator with a preset temperature. The synthesis
was carried out in two steps: the first step is to induce the ice
crystal at −20 °C and the second is to further polymerize
at 4 °C. A thermostatic refrigerator was used to control the
temperature required for the experiment. It was observed that the
mixed solution formed a frozen state within 4–5 min at −20
°C. Subsequently, the gels were taken out and immersed in deionized
water for 12 h to remove any unreacted reagent and water was replaced
every 4 h. After that, the gels were stored in deionized water. In
the experiments, the two-step polymerization time was typically set
to 1/1, 2/2, 9/9, 12/12, and 24/24 h. The as-prepared PNIPAM hydrogels
were designated x/y h, in which
“x” represents the freezing polymerization
time of the first step (at −24 °C) and “y” indicates the thawing polymerization time of the
second step (at 4 °C). In addition, the hydrogel properties were
optimized by varying the Bis concentration (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and
2.0 mg/mL). And the hydrogels were marked as Bis z, in which “z” represents the Bis
concentration.

4.3 Synthesis of PF Hydrogels
PF PNIPAM
hydrogels were synthesized from the order of first polymerization
and freezing. In brief, NIPAM (0.1 g/mL, 0.5 g), APS (2 mg/mL, 10
mg), and Bis (0.2 mg/mL, 1 mg) were dissolved in deionized water (5
mL) to obtain a homogeneous solution in an ice bath. And the mixture
was followed by deoxygenation with N2 (99.99%) for 10 min;
then, TEMED (10 μL) was added under vigorous stirring at 0 °C
for 30 s. Next, the mixed solution was quickly transferred to a refrigerator
with a preset temperature. The mixed solution was first polymerized
at 15 °C for 15 min and then frozen at −24 °C for
24 h.

4.4 Synthesis of FT PNIPAM-MWNT Nanocomposite
Hydrogels
In brief, surfactant SDBS (8 mg/mL, 40 mg), MWNTs
(0.5 mg/mL, 2.5 mg), and deionized water (5 mL) were mixed under ultra-sonication
for 30 min to form a uniform dispersion. Then, NIPAM (0.1 g/mL, 0.5
g), APS (2 mg/mL, 10 mg), and Bis (0.2 mg/mL, 1 mg) were added to
the mixed dispersion and stirred to obtain a homogeneous dispersion
in an ice bath. And the mixture was followed by deoxygenation with
N2 (99.99%) for 10 min; then, TEMED (10 μL) was added
under vigorous stirring at 0 °C for 30 s. Next, the polymerization
time of the two-step method was set to 2/2 h to prepare the PNIPAM-MWNT
nanocomposite hydrogels.

4.5 Determination of Gel Fraction
of FT PNIPAM
The gel fraction was measured by the gravimetric
method. At the
end of the first step, we quickly exposed the sample to air and immersed
in a large amount of water to prevent it from continuing to polymerize.
Then, we washed the sample three times repeatedly to remove unreacted
components. Thereafter, the sample was dried at 90 °C under vacuum
until the constant weight was reached. The gel fraction was obtained
from the ratio of the gel mass after polymerization to the monomer
mass before polymerization. The gel fraction in the second step was
measured using the same method.

4.6 SEM of
Hydrogels
The porous structures
of freeze-dried hydrogels were observed by field emission SEM (Nova
NanoSEM 450) at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The freeze-dried
samples were prepared by rapid freezing of swollen hydrogels under
liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) for 15 min and drying in a freeze-drier
(FreeZone, Labconco) at −48 °C for 48 h. Then, the specimens
were coated with a thin gold layer for SEM observation.

4.7 Characterization of Thermal-Responsive Properties
The
gravimetric method was utilized to monitor the swelling degree
of PNIPAM hydrogels in the range from 20 to 42 °C (temperature
interval: 3 °C). The specimens were cut into discs with a diameter
of 15 mm and a height of 3 mm. The temperature was controlled by a
water bath pot. Before each measurement, the hydrogel samples were
completely swelled at 20 °C for 1 h. Then, each hydrogel sample
was put into the water bath pot. At a certain temperature, the samples
were immersed in water for 10 min and then taken out. The surface
water of samples was removed by a filter paper to record the sample
weights (WT). The swelling ratio (SR)
of hydrogel samples was determined according to the following equation:
SR = WT/Wd, where Wd and WT were the weight of the dried gel and the weight of swollen
gels at different temperatures, respectively. The weights of dry gel
were measured with an electronic balance (OHAUS, EX125DZH) after drying
each sample under vacuum at 80 °C until the weight become constant.

For the swelling-deswelling behavior, the thermo-responsive equilibrium
volume change behaviors of the hydrogel discs were recorded by a digital
camera at 20 and 45 °C, respectively. In the volume change behaviors
of the hydrogel, we assumed that the hydrogels are homogeneously shrunk
and swollen. The dynamic volumetric variation of the hydrogels would
be defined as Vt/V0 = (dt2 × ht)/(d02 × h0), where V0 represents
the initial equilibrium volumes of hydrogels at 20 °C and Vt represents the volumes of
hydrogels at time t in the process of thermal response; d0 and h0 represent
the initial diameters and heights of hydrogels at 20 °C, respectively;
and dt and ht represent the diameters and heights
at time t in the process of thermal response, respectively.

4.8 Characterization of Mechanical Properties
The compressive test of as-prepared hydrogels was measured by a
dynamic mechanical analyzer (RSA-G2, TA, USA). The swollen specimens
were cut into a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 15 mm and a height
of 15 mm and compressed at a strain rate of 10 mm/min. After each
test, an appropriate quantity of deionized water was added to the
sample to ensure that the sample was in a fully swollen state. The
compressive test was operated at room temperature.

4.9 Morphology Analysis
The average pore
size was calculated by manually measuring the diameter of 100 pores
with the imageJ software, and the pore size distribution was statistically
obtained from the diameter of 100 pores. The area porosity was calculated
by the threshold function of imageJ.

4.10 Characterization
of NIR Light Responsiveness
The laser head (wavelength of
808 nm, output power of 500 mW, LM8085003D12-AL)
was used for the NIR light-responsive tests. In order to measure the
volume change of the PNIPAM-MWNT hydrogels responding to the NIR light,
the swollen hydrogel samples were cut into cuboids (length of 3.5
mm, width of 7 mm, and thickness of 1 mm) and exposed to NIR light
at a power density of 5 W cm–2 in water at room
temperature. And to investigate the NIR light-responsive reversibility
of the proposed PNIPAM-MWNT hydrogels, the laser was set to turn on
and off for 8 s duration. The thermo-responsive equilibrium volume
change behaviors of the above samples were recorded by a digital camera.
The dynamic volume change ratios were defined as Vt/V0 = lt × wt × tt/(l0 × w0 × t0), where Vt and V0 were the volumes of hydrogels at time t and
at the beginning (t = 0), respectively; and lt, wt, tt and l0, w0, t0 were the length, width, thickness
of the hydrogels at time t and at the beginning of
NIR illumination, respectively.

4.11 Finite
Element Analysis of Hydrogels
The commercial software ABAQUS
(SIMULIA) was used to carry out the
finite element analysis (FEA), in which the implicit solver was used
to calculate the deformations and stress–strain curves. The
geometrical nonlinearities were considered in the FEA. Eight-node
linear hybrid brick elements with reduced integration were adopted,
with refined meshes to ensure computational accuracy. We assume local
equilibrium at all material points within the volume and subsequently
describe the equilibrium condition by applying the hyperelastic gel
theory developed by Hong et al.51
