The
first-time use of the oxazaborolidine complex in transfer hydrogenation
was accomplished. It was prepared without difficulty from cheap materials:
ethanolamine and BH3·THF. A general and efficient
method for copper-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of a variety of
N-heteroaromatics with an oxazaborolidine–BH3 complex
under mild reaction conditions afforded the corresponding hydrogenated
products in up to 96% yield. Mechanistic studies indicate that the
hydrogen source originated from water and borane that coordinate with
the nitrogen atom of oxazaborolidine. Accordingly, a plausible mechanism
for this reaction was proposed. This method was successfully used
in the key step synthesis of natural products (±)-angustureine
and (±)-galipinine in three steps.

Introduction
Chiral oxazaborolidines
have proven to be powerful and effective
catalysts not only for asymmetric reduction of ketones but also for
Diels–Alder reactions, giving excellent enantioselectivity
(Scheme 1).1 In 1981, Itsuno and co-workers first reported
the asymmetric reduction of achiral aromatic ketones with a mixture
of chiral amino alcohols and a borane–tetrahydrofuran complex
in 60% ee and high yield.2 In 1987, Corey
and co-workers discovered that chiral amino alcohols and borane led
to the formation of chiral oxazaborolidines, which were considered
to be rapid and highly enantioselective catalysts for the reduction
of achiral ketones.3 Later, Corey and Loh
reported that chiral oxazaborolidines were highly effective not only
for the Mukaiyama aldol reaction but also for the Diels–Alder
reaction.4 Recently, Bach and Poplata have
reported the highly enantioselective (82–96% ee) intermolecular
[2 + 2] photocycloaddition reaction of cyclic enones promoted by the
chiral oxazaborolidine–AlBr3 complex.5 Although great progress has been made since the
discovery of this new reaction, the type of reaction is still limited.1b,6 It is highly desirable to expand the application of oxazaborolidines
to different types of reactions.

Scheme 1 Application of Oxazaborolidine
Saturated N-heteroaromatics
are important building blocks for biologically
active natural alkaloids and in the manufacture of commercial drugs.7 Direct hydrogenation of N-heteroaromatics has
emerged as an efficient and straightforward strategy for this preparation.
Despite this, the hydrogenation of N-heteroaromatics remains a challenge
in organic chemistry. This is because of the high resonance stability
of heteroarenes or the potential poisoning and/or deactivation of
the catalyst caused by the nitrogen atom in heteroarene or their hydrogenated
products.8 During the past decade, a number
of homogeneous and heterogeneous metal catalysts, such as Ir,9 Ru,10 Rh,11 Co,12 Mo,13 and Fe,14 have been
used in the hydrogenation of N-heteroaromatics. These methods usually
require high H2 pressures, high reaction temperatures,
and expensive catalysts or ligands. Transfer hydrogenation offers
an alternative method in avoiding the use of flammable hydrogen gas.15 To the best of our knowledge, oxazaborolidine
complexes have not been applied in transfer hydrogenation of N-heteroaromatics.

Can we direct the use of borane (BH3) in the reaction?
Borane is a common reagent in synthetic organic chemistry and has
been widely used in many different types of reactions. However, the
BH3 group coordinates to the nitrogen atom of quinoline
and generates stable monoborane complexes.16 The question now is, how do we solve this problem? In 2017, Shi
and co-workers reported B(C6F5)3-promoted
hydrogenation of N-heterocycles with ammonia borane (BH3·NH3) at 80 °C with 50–87% yields.15h However, BH3·NH3 is an expensive reagent compared to the commercially available BH3·THF. Thus, we have designed a simple oxazaborolidine–BH3 complex based on previous work with chiral oxazaborolidine,
for the reduction of ketone. The complex was synthesized from relatively
inexpensive materials: ethanolamine and BH3·THF. The
advantage is that chiral oxazaborolidine is easily formed for asymmetric
reduction.

Herein, we describe the first successful application
of an oxazaborolidine
complex in the copper-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of N-heteroaromatics
under mild reaction conditions.

Results and Discussion
To initiate our study, 2-methyl quinoline (1a) was
chosen as a model substrate. First, various boron reagents were screened
as the hydrogen source and generated in situ from BH3·THF
with 1,2-diols, 1,2-amino alcohols, 1,2-diamines, 2-aminobenzyl alcohol,
and 1,2-dihydroxybenzene as the hydrogen source precursor (Table 1, HSP1–6).
Cuprous chloride was chosen as the catalyst. The reaction gave the
desired product 2a in 50% yield with HSP2 (Table 1, entry 2). We also evaluated
different copper catalysts (entries 7–12). When copper(II)
perchlorate hexahydrate was used as a catalyst, the yield increased
to 88% (entry 8). However, when THF was replaced with a different
solvent (entries 13–16), the yield decreased. To our delight,
when the temperature increased to 40 °C, the reaction gave 2a in 94% yield (entry 17). When we decreased the reaction
time to 12 h, the yield was still acceptable (entry 18). When the
reaction proceeded without the addition of metal salts, the desired
product 2a was not obtained (entry 19). The results indicate
that the metal salt is instrumental in activating the heterocyclic
ring and is a hydrogen source for the reduction to the desired product.
Lastly, the reaction was carried out under anhydrous conditions with
anhydrous copper trifluoromethanesulfonate and dry BH3·THF
(entry 20), which had been generated from sodium borohydride. However,
only the starting material but no desired products were obtained.
A controlled experiment was also done without HSP under standard conditions
(entry 21), and only the 2-methyl quinoline boron complex was observed.
This indicated that water and HSP are necessary for the reaction,
which has assisted us in understanding the reaction mechanism.

With
the optimized reaction conditions established, we extended
our study to various quinoline substrate derivatives. The results
are summarized in Table 2. First, quinolines bearing a methyl at position 2, 3, or 4 on the
pyridine ring (Table 2, 1a, 1c, 1d), or a methyl
at position 6, 7, or 8 on the benzene ring (1e–1g) were tested. The reaction proceeded smoothly under mild conditions,
and the corresponding 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines were obtained in
87–95% yield. Furthermore, quinolines bearing the sterically
hindered phenyl at position 2 on the pyridine ring (1i) gave the desired product in 82% yield. Interestingly, even with
the phenyl at position 4 on the pyridine ring, which is a challenging
substrate, it was successfully hydrogenated to 2h in
excellent yield (95%). In addition, we were glad to discover that
quinolines bearing furyl (1j) or thienyl (1k) afforded the desired products in good yield. Next, we evaluated
quinolines bearing electron-withdrawing groups on the benzene ring,
including F (1l, 1r) and Cl (1m). The desired products were obtained in good yields. Quinolines
bearing electron-donating groups, such as OMe (1o, 1p) and Me (1q), were also tested, and the desired
products were obtained in good to excellent yields. However, quinoline
bearing the strong electron-donating group of NMe2 (1n) had a significant influence on the reaction, with only
70% yield being obtained. Finally, this method was further applied
to the 2,3-disubstituted quinolines (1s, 1t), affording the corresponding products in good yields (2s, 95%; 2t, 88%) and moderate diastereoselectivity (2s, d.r. = 2.96:1; 2t, d.r. = 2.73:1). Fused
quinolines (1u, 1v) were hydrogenated to
afford the corresponding products in 88–89% yields (2u, d.r. = 1.36:1; 2v, d.r. = 1.32:1).

Encouraged by these results,
we applied this method in the reduction
of a few important N-heteroaromatics, including quinoxaline (Table 3, 3a–3f), acridine (3g), and phenanthroline (3h). Quinoxaline, with a mono- or disubstituted methyl, was reduced
to give high yields under mild conditions. Acridine reacted smoothly,
affording the desired product in 88% yield. Interestingly, phenanthroline,
which is a challenging substrate, was reduced to yield either partially
or completely hydrogenated products. When phenanthroline was subjected
to the standard reaction conditions, two products, in low yield, were
observed. However, the yield improved with the addition of cesium
carbonate, and the partially hydrogenated major product 4h was obtained in 65% yield.

(4.0 equiv).

d Cs2CO3 (2.0

To understand the
mechanism, we performed deuterium-labeled experiments
(Scheme 2). We replaced
THF with D2O, and the desired hydrogenated product was
obtained in 23% yield, showing high deuterium incorporation at position
3 (eq 1). When the deuterium oxazaborolidine complex and D2O were used in the reaction, trideuterated 6 was obtained
(28%) with high deuterium incorporation. Because BH3 or
BD3 was generated from NaBH4 or NaBD4 and its content was much lower than 1 M solution, it resulted in
a lower yield. These results demonstrated that H2O and
BH3 are the H-donors for this transfer hydrogenation reaction.
Water offers the H-atom at position 3 on the product and borane offers
H-atoms at positions 2 and 4 on the product.

Scheme 2 Deuterium-Labeled
Experiments
On the basis of experimental
results, we have proposed a plausible
mechanism (Scheme 3). First, the copper catalyst and oxazaborolidine complex A forms the active catalytic species B. Then, B coordinates to quinoline (1b) to afford complex C. Subsequent transfer of the hydride from BH3 to
position 2 on quinoline forms intermediate D and releases
catalytic species E. Active catalytic species B regenerates from catalytic species E and oxazaborolidine
complex A. Intermediate D undergoes hydrolysis
to give 1,2-dihydroquinoline F, which isomerizes to 1,4-dihydroquinoline G. 1,4-Dihydroquinoline G isomerizes to enamine H,15f which is reduced by a similar
catalytic cycle to form intermediate J. Eventually, the
hydrolysis of intermediate J gives tetrahydroquinoline
(2b). This explains the reason for the formation of the
product that was only deuterated at position 3 of 2-methyl quinoline 5 in the deuterium-labeled experiments (Scheme 2, eq 1).

Scheme 3 Plausible Mechanism
We went on further to apply our method in the
key step synthesis
of natural products. (±)-Angustureine17 and (±)-galipinine,18 which have
been isolated from the bark of the tropical American shrubby tree Galipea officinalis, have multiple biological activities.19 The reaction begins with 2-aminobenzyl alcohol 7 and various ketones 8 to afford quinolines 9.20 This is followed by copper-catalyzed
transfer hydrogenation with oxazaborolidine complex under mild conditions,
giving 10 in high yields. Methylation21 easily gave the final natural product 11 in
a total of 3 steps (Scheme 4).

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have successfully expanded the use of oxazaborolidine
complex in the copper-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of N-heteroaromatics
under mild reaction conditions. The oxazaborolidine complex was prepared
without difficulty from cheap materials: ethanolamine and BH3·THF. A variety of N-heteroaromatics were successfully converted
to the corresponding reduced products with good to excellent yields.
Deuterium-labeled experiments were also undertaken and showed that
water and borane, which coordinate to the nitrogen atom of oxazaborolidine,
are the hydrogen sources. Furthermore, this method was used in the
key step synthesis of natural products (±)-angustureine and (±)-galipinine
in three steps. We are currently investigating the application of
the oxazaborolidine complex in different heteroaromatics, including
asymmetric transfer hydrogenation.

Experimental Section
General
Information
All reactions were set up using
standard Schlenk techniques under argon gas. Reactions were monitored
by thin-layer chromatography carried out at 0.2 ± 0.03 mm using
UV light as the visualizing agent in silica gel as developing agents. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
AVANCE III HD 400 spectrometer (1H: 400 MHz. 13C: 101 MHz). CDCl3 was used as the solvent, and tetramethylsilane
(TMS) was used as the internal standard. Chemical shifts (δ)
for 1H and 13C NMR spectra are given in ppm
relative to TMS. The residual solvent signals were used as references
for 1H and 13C NMR spectra and the chemical
shifts converted to the TMS scale (CDCl3: δH = 7.26 ppm. δC = 77.16 ppm). Coupling constants
(J) are expressed in Hz. The following abbreviations
were used to designate chemical shift multiplicities: s = singlet,
d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet, and br = broad. Column chromatography
was performed using silica gel (200–300 mesh). Visualization
of the developed chromatogram was performed by UV absorbance (254
nm) unless otherwise noted. High-resolution mass spectral (HRMS) data
were recorded on a SHIMADZU LCMS-IT-TOF by analytical center at Sichuan
University. N-Heteroaromatic substrates 1h–1i,221j–1k,20a1s–1t,20a1v,20a3b,233c,24 and 9a–9b20a were synthesized
according to reported procedures, and other substrates were obtained
from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification.

General Procedure A for Copper-Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation
of N-Heteroaromatics
To a 25 mL Schlenk tube equipped with
a magnetic stirrer bar were added ethanolamine (1.0 mmol, 61.08 mg)
and BH3·THF (1.0 M in THF, 2 mL, 2.0 mmol) at 0 °C
under an argon atmosphere. The tube was sealed and the mixture was
allowed to stir at room temperature for 24 h. The oxazaborolidine
complex was prepared after the solvent was removed under vacuum. To
the Schlenk tube with the oxazaborolidine complex (1.0 mmol) were
added Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.1 mmol),
N-heteroaromatics (0.5 mmol), and THF (2.0 mL) under an argon atmosphere.
The tube was sealed and the mixture was allowed to stir at 40 °C
for 24 h. Then, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The product was purified by column chromatography
on silica gel using petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (15:1–8:1,
v/v) as eluent.

General Procedure B for the Synthesis of 6
In a round-bottom flask fitted with a rubber stopper and an argon
inlet, NaBD4 (6 mmol) was suspended in 5 mL of diglyme.
This flask was connected through a plastic cannula to a second flask
containing a solution of ethanolamine (2 mmol) in 4 mL of anhydrous
THF at 0 °C. The second flask was vented through a plastic cannula
bubbling into THF. Iodine (6.2 mmol) in diglyme (5 mL) was added into
the first flask dropwise over 1 h by syringe. At the end of the addition
of I2, the temperature of the second flask was brought
to room temperature and the stream of argon was continued for 2 h.
Deuterium oxazaborolidine was prepared after the solvent in the second
flask was removed under vacuum. To a 25 mL Schlenk tube equipped with
a magnetic stirrer bar were added deuterium oxazaborolidine complex
(1.0 mmol), Cu(CF3SO3)2 (0.1 mmol),
D2O (1.2 mL), and 2-methlyquinoline (0.5 mmol). The tube
was sealed and the mixture was allowed to stir at 40 °C for 24
h. Then, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The product was purified by flash column chromatography
on silica gel using petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (10:1, v/v) as eluent.
