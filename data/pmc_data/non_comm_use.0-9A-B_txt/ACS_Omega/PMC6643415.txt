Hybrid
powder coatings (HPC) with low friction and high hardness
enhance the sliding speed and allow interlocking or meshing products
to slide effortlessly within each other, saving energy. In automobiles,
they decrease fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emission. In the
present work, a new insight of the key role played by the coverage
density of triethoxyphenylsilane (TPS) grafted to SiO2 nanoparticles
over the friction coefficient, hardness, elastic modulus, and roughness
of HPC is presented for the first time. In all cases, a very low amount
(0.1 wt %) of functionalized or unfunctionalized SiO2 nanoparticles
were added to a powder-coating formulation based on polyester resin.
HPC formulated with functionalized nanoparticles at a suitable coverage
density (HPC–TPS3) exhibited significantly low friction coefficient
(μ = 0.12), strong wear resistance (under dry sliding conditions
at 1 and 5 N of load), low roughness (Rq = 3.5 nm), and high hardness and elastic modulus on the surface.
We demonstrated that it is possible to tune the macroscopic properties
by varying only the coverage density of TPS that is chemically attached
to SiO2 nanoparticles. Also, a physicochemical explanation
was disclosed, wherein a hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance between
−OH and phenyl groups was proposed. In all cases, the phenyl
group allows the migration of functionalized nanoparticles through
the polyester matrix, enhancing the hardness and elastic modulus on
the surface. Thus, the functional nanomaterial design with tunable
coverage density is a powerful tool to improve the physical and superficial
properties of powder coatings using low amounts of nanomaterial.

1 Introduction
Hybrid powder coatings
(HPC) are very attractive materials from
a scientific and industrial point of view because of their easy processability,
higher surface coverage, and high rate of reuses1 with energy saving. Furthermore, because they are solid
powders (free of volatile organic compounds), they are considered
environmentally respectful with a wide range of uses in office furniture,
tools, windows, automobiles, and household appliances and as a barrier
to prevent corrosion of metal structures.2

Many efforts have been focused to obtain HPC with improved
physical–chemical
properties by means of nanoparticle addition of SiO2,3−7 TiO2,6,8 CaCO3,9 or nanoclays10,11 into saturated8 or un-saturated polyester,5,10,11 carboxylated polyester,6,7 and
polyester/epoxy.5,9 In particular, polyester resins
used in HPC are solids, with carboxyl-terminal groups, which react
with suitable cure agents, such as triglycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC)
to obtain HPC with good mechanical and esthetic properties. Nonetheless,
although the presence of neat or functionalized nanoparticles/nanofillers
enhances the mechanical6 and adhesion properties,7 as well as reduces the wear rate and decreases
the friction coefficient (μ) of coated samples,12 large amounts of nanoparticles must be used to achieve
significant results; however, this strategy changes the flowability
and as a consequence their melt viscosity.6 Particularly, scientific works regarding HPC based on carboxylated
polyester resins and functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles
are scarce, for example: Mirabedini and Kiamanesh6 added 1, 2, and 3 wt % of commercial functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles (R972, functionalized with dimethyldichlorosilane
and HDK H30 functionalized with dimethylsiloxy) to a powder coating
formulation. The authors found that HDK H30 increased the hardness,
tensile strength, and elastic modulus of the coatings because of the
good chemical interactions between functionalized nanoparticles and
the polymeric matrix. Puig et al.7 studied
organo-modified amorphous silica particles (OSP) with trifunctional
organosilane (alkyl-triethoxysilane) as an adhesion promoter in a
polyester powder coating. The results show that OSP incorporation
(1, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 wt %) leads to an improvement in their corrosion
protection of the coatings, as well as in their adhesion properties
up to 2.5 wt %. Concentrations beyond 2.5 wt % promote the formation
of aggregates, leading to the detriment of mechanical and electrochemical
performance.

Moreover, a suitable design of new nanofillers
with multifunctional
performance offering good dispersion into the polymeric matrix, without
strong flowability changes and using small amounts of nanomaterial
(<1 wt %), is highly demanded. Therefore, it is clear that despite
the existing industrial and scientific interest, fundamental aspects
regarding how the “graft density” or “coverage
density” of functional SiO2 nanoparticles affects
the macroscopic properties of the coatings (frictions, roughness,
etc.) have not been addressed yet. On this basis, some fundamental
questions have not been answered, such as how
is the coverage density (also known as graft density) of TPS onto
SiO2 nanoparticles tuned and how many groups are possible
to chemically attach? What is the optimal concentration of functional
groups that allows obtaining a composite with improved properties?
Is there any chemical compatibility between the functional organic
groups and the polymeric matrix?

Hence, the role of the coverage
density or graft density of triethoxyphenylsilane
(TPS) functional groups chemically attached on SiO2 nanoparticles
over the macroscopic properties of HPC is studied for the first time
to offer some answers to the questions proposed previously. Several
levels of graft density (Gφ) of
TPS on SiO2 nanoparticles were obtained, wherein a plateau
of maximum functionalization was reached. Three kinds of Gφ were selected and “scaled-up” to
produce 1 g of material. In all cases, 0.1 wt % of functionalized
or neat SiO2 nanoparticles was added to a powder coating
formulation, to obtain a hybrid coating with enhanced physical properties.
Herein, we find that the friction coefficient (using a load of 1 and
5 N), wear resistant, roughness, hardness and elastic modulus of HPC
can be modulated by varying only the coverage density of TPS chemically
attached to SiO2 nanoparticles; and this coverage density
can be modified controlling the amount of functionalizing agent added
during the functionalization reaction. Also, a physicochemical explanation
was disclosed, wherein a hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance between
−OH and phenyl groups was proposed. In all cases, the phenyl
group allows the migration of functionalized nanoparticles through
the polyester matrix, enhancing the hardness and elastic modulus on
the surface. Thus, we demonstrate that the functionalization of SiO2 nanoparticles with a judicious amount of organic molecules
is the best way to obtain new enhanced materials using very low amounts
of functional filler (0.1 wt %).

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Functionalization Mechanism
of NPSiO2 with TPS
The covalent grafting of alkoxysilane
coupling
agents (well-known as silylation reaction) has been carried out typically
in aqueous solutions by a sequential hydrolysis/condensation reaction,
wherein the activation of the surface by inorganic acids or using
acidic aqueous solutions is necessary to improve the grafting process
(e.g., sol–gel). Nonetheless, it is poorly reproducible and
is a non-homogeneous process, because it produces an island-type grafting
due to condensation and clustering of the alkoxysilane agents; furthermore,
water is formed as a by-product affecting the chemical equilibrium,
because the condensation rate reaction begins to dominate over the
hydrolysis reaction. To avoid this, herein we performed the silylation
reaction without any catalyst under anhydrous conditions using toluene
as the nonpolar solvent. These reaction conditions promote excellent
reproducibility and a uniform distribution of grafts (similar to those
obtained during controlled vapor deposition). Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the
silylation reaction of NPSiO2 with TPS under anhydrous
conditions and nitrogen atmosphere at 60 °C.

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of the silylation mechanism between NPSiO2 and TPS at 60
°C.

Figure 1 shows the
schematic silylation mechanism wherein the coupling mechanism consists
of combined nucleophilic substitutions at the silicon atoms of both
surface siloxane and silylating agent.13 Following Figure 1, first the nucleophilic attack is favored through bonding electron
delocalization induced through a concerted nucleophilic attack of
a silicon atom of the siloxane group by the oxygen atom of the ethoxy
group13 because electron donor ability
of oxygen decreases in the order C–O–C > C–O–Si
> Si–O–Si. In this case, alkoxysilane moieties and
the
ethoxy group were chemically anchored to a silicon atom of siloxane,
forming a new Si–O–Si bond and Si–OEt, respectively.
After that, a second nucleophilic substitution occurs when a neighboring
oxygen atom of the silanol group attacks the silicon atom of the alkoxysilane,
which leads to a new Si–O–Si bond and ethanol as a by-product.
Thus, a covalent attachment of alkoxysilane to the surface is achieved,
wherein the phenyl group is considered a “hanging group”
from the silica surface, which imparts the desired functionality.

Besides, it is well known that the mechanism of silylation in the
presence of toluene anhydrous (no polar solvent) is nucleophilic (because
in the presence of aqueous solution it is electrophilic) and as a
consequence the graft takes place mainly on the hydrophobic portion
of the silica surface (siloxane groups) and to a lesser extent over
the hydrophilic portion (free silanols), as it will be demonstrated
by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) in another section of this paper.
Furthermore, the stoichiometry of surface reactions with several alkoxysilanes
(RSiX3, R2SiX2, R3SiX),
wherein X = Cl, OCH3 or OC2H5 and
R = organic group, has been extensively studied, and also, it has
been well established that using bifunctional (R2SiX2) or trifunctional (RSiX3) alkoxysilanes to modify
any surface, one of two Si–X groups per bonded functional group
remain unreacted14 as shown in Figure 1.

2.2 ATR–FTIR Qualitative Evidence of NPSiO2 Functionalized
with TPS
Alkoxysilane (TPS), neat
NPSiO2 (without functionalization), and functionalized
surface of NPSiO2 with different amounts of alkoxysilane
(FSiO2–TPSX|X=1,...,5) were characterized by attenuated total reflectance
(ATR)–FTIR, and their spectra are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 ATR–FTIR spectra
corresponding to alkoxysilane TPS, unmodified
NPSiO2, and NPSiO2 functionalized with TPS (FSiO2–TPSX|X=1,...,5) at several graft densities.

Figure 2 shows
characteristic
vibrations corresponding to TPS: C–H stretching (νC–H 3072–3029 cm–1) corresponding
to the aromatic or unsaturated C(sp2)–H and out-of-plane
ring C=C bending at 700 cm–1. Aliphatic:
C–H 2975 cm–1 νasCH3, 2887 cm–1 νsCH3, 2927 cm–1 νasCH2,
1391 cm–1 δasCH2, 786
cm–1 δsCH out-of-plane. Symmetric
and asymmetric stretching vibrations at 1079 and 1295 cm–1, respectively, were observed and attributed to C–O–Si.
NPSiO2 exhibited a broad intermolecular hydrogen bond centered
at 3387 cm–1 corresponding to silanol (Si–OH)
groups. At 503, 786 cm–1, and in the region of 830–1200
cm–1 a very strong vibration attributed to stretching
vibrations of Si–O–Si bonds was observed.

Indeed,
as can be seen in Figure 2, the graft density increases with the alkoxysilane
content fed. In all functionalized materials, C–H stretching
at 3011 cm–1 corresponding to unsaturated C(sp2)–H (from TPS) was observed. Overtones or combination
bands in the range of 2000–1600 cm–1 corresponding
to the aromatic ring were identified in NPSiO2 functionalized,
indicating the presence of TPS. Undeniably, all these vibrations are
more evident when a high graft density was obtained. Furthermore,
aliphatic groups also were observed which is in good agreement with
the silylation mechanism showed in Figure 1, wherein ethoxy groups of the TPS molecule
were chemically attached to the NPSiO2 surface and some
of them did not participate in the silylation reaction.

Interestingly,
as the graft density increased, the broadband at
1103 cm–1 corresponding to siloxane groups (Si–O–Si)
of NPSiO2 was divided into two well-defined bands: at 1227
and 1064 cm–1. The first band (1227 cm–1) was attributed to the new covalent bonds Si–O–Si
formed by (i) the reaction between siloxane groups from the silica
surface and Si–OEt from alkoxysilane during the silylation
reaction, and (ii) the subsequent reaction between Si–OH and
Si–OEt (see the mechanism in Figure 1). The second band at 1064 cm–1 was attributed to unreacted Si–O–Si groups from the
silica surface. Also, the intensity of bending vibrations of Si–O–Si
at 808 and 503 cm–1 decreased notoriously when a
high amount of alkoxysilane was used. This fact is in good agreement
with the reaction mechanism showed before and it is confirmed that
the graft takes place mainly on the hydrophobic portion (siloxane
groups) of the silica surface as was mentioned previously.

2.3 Graft Density Analysis of NPSiO2 Functionalized with
TPS
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
was used to analyze pure and functionalized NPSiO2 with
different graft density of alkoxysilane (FSiO2–TPSX|X=1,...,5) in order to obtain
more understanding about: (i) the silylation reaction, (ii) the optimal
graft density (Gφ), and (iii) the
grafting yield (Gy) behavior. First, #OH/nm2 on the NPSiO2 surface was calculated (using eq 6, see the Experimental Section) to be 2.8 OH/nm2. This value
is consistent with values reported by Mueller et al.15 for the same kind of NPSiO2 (A200) measured
using TGA coupled with a mass spectrometer (TGA/MS). Also, here we
propose a simple way to calculate the #OH/nm2 as follows 1  where wti is the initial sample
weight before running TGA. Thus, using eq 1, we obtain 2.75 OH/nm2 in concordance
with the result obtained previously using eq 6. On the other hand, functionalization of
dry NPSiO2 by reacting TPS alkoxysilane coupling agent
can be easily carried out in toluene to give a monolayer,16 although for some alkoxysilanes possessing reactive
groups, multilayers can be built up by repeated reactions between
2 alkoxysilane molecules and two previously chemisorbed layers.14 During the functionalization reaction, a molar
excess of alkoxysilane has been employed in order to achieve the maximum
coverage or maximum Gφ, which is
shown as a plateau level in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Graft density (Gφ) and
grafting
yield (Gy) of functionalized nanoparticles
(FSiO2–TPSX|X=1,...,5) as a function of alkoxysilane concentration.

In Figure 3, graft
density increases and grafting yield decreases as a function of the
alkoxysilane concentration. Consequently, as the alkoxysilane content
increases the full saturation or maximum coverage of the nanoparticles
surface is gradually reached, which is evidenced when no perceptible
changes in the graft density value are observed. In this case, saturation
of the nanoparticle surface by TPS was reached when a plateau level
was obtained at Gφ = 0.79 μmol/m2 (0.47 molecules/nm2) using [TPS]0 =
18 μmol/m2. This Gφ value (0.79 μmol/m2) is lower than those values
reported in the literature when trialkoxysilane or chlorosilane coupling
agents have been used.14,16,17 Nevertheless, the surface coverage value depends strongly on both
the alkoxysilane molar composition and the functional group structure.
Also, it has been reported that alkoxysilane possessing one phenyl
group attached to the silicon atom in their structure significantly
decreases the surface coverage in a factor of 2.14 In the present contribution, the fact to obtain a plateau
level reveals the full coverage of the nanoparticle surface by the
TPS; although this only represents 17.2% of Si–OH that had
reacted, which suggests steric hindrance limitations. Table 1 shows the values obtained for
the graft density Gφ in μmol/m2 and molecules/nm2, grafting yield (Gy), and the percent of functionalization or level of surface
coverage (f) for all functionalized materials obtained
here.

c Gφ2 (molecules/nm2) = Gφ1 × NA × 10–24.

d Gy was
calculated using eq 5 (see Experimental Section).

e f (%) = (Gφ2/2.75) × 100.

As revealed in Table 1, different levels of Gφ for each
kind of functionalized nanoparticles (FSiO2–TPSX|X=1,...,5) were obtained from Gφ = 0.36 μmol/m2 (f = 7.8%) up to reach the saturation at Gφ = 0.79 μmol/m2 (f = 17.2%). According to these results, three kinds of functionalized
nanoparticles with different density of functional groups labeled
as FSiO2–TPS1 (low Gφ, f = 7.8%), FSiO2–TPS3 (medium Gφ, f = 11.4%), and FSiO2–TPS5 (high Gφ, f = 17.2%) were chosen to be added to a powder coating formulation.
Therefore, 5 g of each selected functionalized material (FSiO2–TPSX|X=1,3,5) was obtained under the same procedure described to produce 1 g
of functionalized material, with the aiming to produce enough quantity
of functionalized nanoparticles in order to be incorporated into a
powder coating formulation and then to study the Gφ effect over their macroscopic properties. All
“scaled up” functional materials exhibited the same Gφ1, Gφ2, and % f that those obtained using 1 g NPSiO2, confirming thus the excellent reproducibility of the silylation
reaction without a catalyst under anhydrous conditions.

2.4 HPC Formulations Based on Polymer/Nanoparticles
As
was described in the Experimental Section,
functionalized NPSiO2 with TPS produced here “at
large scale” (FSiO2–TPSX|X=1,3,5), pure NPSiO2, and
R972 were added (0.1 wt % in each case) into a powder coating formulation
based on polyester resin/TGIC/degassing and flowing agents (99.9 wt
%). HPC formulations obtained here (HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5, HPC-A200, HPC-R972) and control
sample (PC, without nanoparticles) were characterized by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), wherein two significant events as revealed
in Figure 4 were observed.

Figure 4 Glass
transition temperature (Tg) and
cross-linking temperature (Tcrosslinking) of HPC (HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5, HPC-A200, HPC-R972) and control sample (PC, without
nanoparticles).

The glass transition
temperature (Tg) of powder coating formulation
without nanoparticles (PC) was observed
at 58.49 °C as well as an exothermal event at 179.3 °C (ΔH = 10.1 J/g). This latter was attributed to cross-linking
temperature (Tcrosslinking), which is
due to the cure reaction between the carboxyl groups from the end
of polyester chains and the epoxy groups from TGIC, as was described
by Piazza et al.11 Interestingly, a decrement
of ∼1.7–2 °C on the Tg of HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5 was produced when FSiO2–TPSX|X=1,3,5 were added (0.1 wt %) to the powder
coating formulation, respectively. Herein, we propose that this decrement
on the Tg could be associated with a suitable
dispersion of nanoparticles into the polymer matrix.18 This proper surface segregation of nanoparticles can produce
a “plasticization effect” due to (i) the good interfacial
interaction between the polyester matrix and the phenyl group (from
TPS) and (ii) the additional free volume provided by the “plasticizer”
(nanoparticle + functional segment), facilitating thus the segmental
movements in the polymer chains,19 which
promote a Tg reduction. Also, for all
HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5, the cross-linking enthalpy was practically the same (ΔH = 16.1, 15.8, 16 J/g) but not their Tcrosslinking. In this sense, HPC–TPS1 (low Gφ) exhibited a cure temperature of 185.8
°C, which represents an increase of 6.5 °C in comparison
with the cure temperature of the control sample (PC = 179.3 °C).
Furthermore, we observed that as the Gφ increases, the Tcrosslinking diminished
up to 181.7 °C (high Gφ). This
phenomenon can be equivalent to increasing the amount of nanofiller
added to a polymeric matrix;11 meanwhile
in our case, we only systematically increase the number of functional
groups (coverage density or Gφ),
maintaining fixed the total amount of nanoparticles added (0.1 wt
%) to the powder coating formulation. This result is a clear evidence
that modulating the coverage density can to induce a significant change
on the thermal macroscopic properties of powder coatings formulations.
On the other hand, when pure NPSiO2 (A200) or R972 was
added (0.1 wt %) to the powder coating formulation to obtain HPC-A200
and HPC-R972, respectively, and a slight increase of around 1 °C
(respect to PC) on the Tg was observed.
NPSiO2 (A200) and R972 possess hydroxyl and dimethyl groups
on their surface, respectively. In both cases, these functional groups
can promote nanoparticles agglomeration because of their high incompatibility
with the polymer matrix, resulting in an increase in the powder coating
stiffness.

2.5 Tribological Properties
of HPC Electrostatically
Deposited onto Carbon Steel Sheets
Each HPC (HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5), HPC-A200, HPC-R972
as well as the control sample (PC) were electrostatically deposited
onto carbon steel sheets and thermally cured to obtain a homogenous
film. The typical tribological curves of hybrid coatings at two normal
loads of 1 and 5 N during 25 000 and 12 500 sliding
cycles are given in Figure 5A,B, respectively. In Figure 5A, all hybrid coatings (HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5, HPC-A200, HPC-R972) and control
sample (PC, without nanoparticles) were subjected to a normal load
of 1 N to assess their corresponding friction coefficient (μ).
In all cases (except in PC), the content of nanoparticles was 0.1
wt %. The control sample PC exhibited a μ ≈ 0.15 during
the first 18 000 sliding cycles; after that, the μ increased
suddenly until an approximate value of μ ≈ 0.43. This
abrupt increase is due to that during the tribological analysis (using
a ball-on-disc tribometer, under dry-sliding conditions), the ball
quickly wore-out the coating, exposing thus the coating–substrate
interface as revealed in Figure 6B, which shows the wear tracks observed on the hybrid
coating using an optical microscope. The wear rate (mm3/Nm) and the volume lost (mm3) also are shown in Figure 6A.

Figure 5 Curves of friction coefficient
(μ) vs sliding cycles for
hybrid coatings (HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5, HPC-A200, HPC-R972) and control sample (PC, without
nanoparticles). (A) measured under an applied force of 1 N during
25 000 sliding cycles. (B) measured under an applied force
of 5 N during 12 500 sliding cycles. In all cases, sliding
speed was of 0.05 m/s.

Figure 6 Hybrid coatings (HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5, HPC-A200, HPC-R972) and control sample (PC,
without nanoparticles): (A) curves of volume lost (mm3)
and wear rate (mm3/Nm) measured under an applied force
of 1 and 5 N during 500 m. (B) Wear tracks observed for each sample
using an optical microscope.

Hybrid coatings HPC-A200 and HPC-R972 in Figure 5A failed since the beginning
of the tribological
test, showing the highest value of μ ≈ 0.47. In this
case, we propose that the presence of −OH groups (from A200)
and −CH3 (from R972) promoted a poor dispersion,
an unfavorable compatibility, and the presence of agglomerations.
These latter produce big and fitful lumps on the surface of the coating
[as will be disclosed later by atomic force microscopy (AFM)], which
are worn-out together with the adjacent polymeric matrix due to the
abrasive wear by the steel ball. This deeper penetration in the hybrid
coating is clearly observed by the wear tracks in Figure 6B. The fast wear rate at the
beginning of the test is due to the lack of cohesive strength in the
hybrid coatings HPC-A200 and HPC-R972.

Interestingly, very different
tribological behaviors were observed
by only tuning the coverage density of TPS (graft density, Gφ = 0.36, 0.52, and 0.79 μmol/nm2) over the silica nanoparticles using functional hybrid coatings
(HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5). Thus, tribological performance corresponding to the HPC–TPS1
sample was similar to that observed in the control sample. In this
case, FSiO2–TPS1 (low Gφ = 0.36 μmol/nm2 of TPS) was used, wherein some
−OH groups were functionalized with TPS; however, this low
coverage density seems to be enough to promote a similar performance
to the control sample. Nevertheless, if silica nanoparticles are not
functionalized or the functional groups are incompatible with the
matrix, the tribological test fails quickly as was discussed previously.

When a high Gφ = 0.79 μmol/nm2 of TPS is used to obtain HPC–TPS5, the friction coefficient
progressively increases from μ ≈ 0.13 to μ ≈
0.15 during the first 10 000 sliding cycles; after that, the
coating fails reaching μ ≈ 0.45. Here, the maximum coverage
of NPSiO2 by TPS was obtained; and this high density of
groups produces a good interaction (chemical affinity) between them,
producing agglomeration of nanoparticles. This coalescence due to
the presence of highly functionalized nanoparticles prevents their
effective dispersion within the coating, which affects their tribological
performance. In all cases, fluctuations in the friction curve were
observed, which indicate a stick-slip behavior.

Good compatibility
between the inorganic filler and the polymer
matrix is highly desirable to improve the macroscopic properties of
any composite. In the case of HPC–TPS3, an optimum graft density
(Gφ = 0.52 μmol/nm2) or coverage density was obtained. The suitable balance between
−OH groups unfunctionalized and functional groups of TPS (phenyl
groups in TPS are of the same nature that the polymeric matrix) suggests
a good dispersion of FSiO2–TPS3 within the coating,
which improves the compatibility with the polymeric matrix and promotes
a positive effect on the toughness of the polymer coating. Surprisingly,
the wear track in this sample was not possible to observe under the
optical microscope, as the volume lost during all test round was 1
× 10–4 mm3 (see Figure 6). Figure 5A shows the lowest friction coefficient obtained
here of about μ ≈ 0.12 during all tribological tests
(500 m, 25 000 sliding cycles). Also, the fluctuation associated
with the stick-slip behavior was noticeably minimized.

On the
other hand, when the load is increased up to 5 N (see Figure 5B), the control sample
(PC) and hybrid coatings (HPC–TPS1, HPC–TPS5, HPC-A200,
and HPC-R972) failed at the beginning of the tribological test. Indeed,
the friction, wear tracks, and the amount of wear debris increased
as increasing normal load, which is in good agreement with the Archard’s
wear law.20 Nonetheless, the hybrid coating
HPC–TPS3 exhibited a good wear resistance, maintaining a μ
≈ 0.15 during 12 500 sliding cycles. These results suggest
that the surface of HPC–TPS3 (Gφ = 0.52 μmol/nm2) is hard and strong with a flat
topography without lumps (see AFM analysis).

2.6 Surface
Analysis by AFM
As was described
previously, the sample HPC–TPS3 (Gφ = 0.52 μmol/nm2) exhibited the lowest friction
coefficient at 1 and 5 N of nominal load. We believe that the functionalized
nanoparticles (at this suitable graft density) promote a good dispersion
in all surfaces, which enhances the surface hardness. This is due
to the mechanical interlocking phenomenon between the functional group
(TPS) in the SiO2 nanoparticles and the polymer; thus,
the surface roughness (root mean square, Rq, also called rms) noticeably decreases as is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 2D and 3D AFM images
and roughness analysis of hybrid coatings
(HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5, HPC-A200, HPC-R972) and control sample (PC, without nanoparticles).

In the case of HPC, HPC-A200 and
HPC-R972, the polymer matrix does
not interact with the functional groups on the surface of A200 (−OH)
or R-972 (−CH3). These chemical groups are incompatible
with the polymer matrix, leading to large particle agglomerates as
a consequence of the close contact between aggregates. This phenomenon
is translated into a sharp topography with high Rq values: 31.2 and 26.6 nm, respectively, with a low tribological
performance and a high friction coefficient. On the other hand, PC
(control sample) and HPC–TPS1 exhibited the same surface roughness Rq = 10.3 nm. This result is in good agreement
with the evolution of the friction coefficient observed for the same
samples during the tribological test (see Figure 5). In this case, HPC–TPS1 does not
promote any changes in the surface roughness, because FSiO2–TPS1 exhibited a low graft density (Gφ = 0.36 μmol/nm2) with a functionalization
efficiency of 7.8%, which means that there exists many available −OH
groups on the NPSiO2 surface and/or a lot of NPSiO2 unfunctionalized. Nevertheless, when densely covered nanoparticles
(Gφ = 0.79 μmol/nm2) by TPS are used (wherein a “plateau” of maxima functionalization
was obtained using large amounts of TPS: 18 μmol/nm2) to obtain HPC–TPS5, the surface roughness exhibited a slight
decrease up to reach Rq = 8 nm. Nonetheless,
this decrease in the roughness does not promote a surface with low
friction coefficient during all tests, as was disclosed before. It
is due to the high density of TPS groups onto the nanoparticles (or
low amount of −OH groups unfunctionalized), which produces
a good chemical affinity between TPS groups and as a consequence their
agglomeration. In perspective, this effect is similar when the −OH
groups predominate over the TPS groups in the HPC–TPS1 sample.

Interestingly, using a medium-functionalized material (FSiO2–TPS3 with Gφ = 0.52
μmol/nm2), a good “balance” between
−OH and TPS groups (HPC–TPS3, case) can promote a coating
with enhanced macroscopic properties: low friction coefficient (μ
≈ 0.12–0.14 during all dry tribological test at 1 and
5 N), high Young modulus and hardness, and low roughness (Rq = 3.5 nm), as shown in Figure 7.

2.7 Mechanical Properties by
Nano-indentation
On the basis of the surface roughness results
and the frictional
coefficient analysis of each system, we can correlate these two parameters
as shown in Figure 8A, wherein the HPC–TPS3 exhibited the lowest both roughness
(3.5 nm) and friction coefficient (μ ≈ 0.12–0.14)
corresponding to a load of 1 and 5 N, respectively.

Figure 8 (A) Roughness vs friction
coefficient. (B) Cross-sectional SEM
image of HPC. (C,D) Mechanical properties (hardness and Young modulus)
by nano-indentation in the cross section of hybrid coatings (HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5 and control sample
(PC, without nanoparticles).

In general, we can affirm that the low roughness is contributed
to the friction coefficient reduction as no micro-structured or textured
surfaces were observed by AFM. On the other hand, the high wear resistant
exhibited by HPC–TPS3 should be related to the specific hardness
on the surface. In order to analyze this important issue, both the
hardness and Young modulus of HPC (HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5) and the control sample (PC,
without nanoparticles) were obtained by nano-indentation on the cross
section of each sample (depth profile with 10 nano-indentations per
sample) as is schematized in Figure 8B. “0” position means hardness and elastic
modulus measurements onto the solid–gas (outer coating-air)
interface, and “10” position means hardness and elastic
modulus measurements onto the solid–solid (inner coating–metallic
substrate) interface. Between them (0–10), we measure 8 nano-indentation
to scanning the transverse direction on the powder coating.

As shown in Figure 8C,D, the PC mechanical properties (hardness and Young modulus) were
constant through the cross section of the powder coating. Certainly,
this behavior is expected because the PC does not have any nanomaterial
in their formulation, preserving their same mechanical properties
through their thickness. Interestingly, HPC–TPS3 exhibited
both the greater hardness (350 ± 10 MPa) and the highest Young
modulus (10.1 ± 0.5) GPa onto the outer cross-sectional surface.
In all hybrid materials, the hardness and the elastic modulus values
decreased as the nano-indentation analysis progressed transversely
through the coating, until reaching an average value located near
to the coating center (depth: 40 μm). After that, the mechanical
properties observed at more depth, increased slightly until to reach
the solid–solid interface (depth: 80 μm). This behavior
suggests the presence of a migration phenomenon of nanoparticles through
the powder coating toward the interfaces as is schematized in Figure 9A–C.

energy behavior corresponding to HPC with low, medium, and high grafting
density. (D–F) SEM images of 100Cr6 balls after frictional
experiments, corresponding to HPC (HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5).

Nanoparticle migration could be produced during the melting
process
before curing and was attributed to the suitable concentration of
phenyl groups chemically attached to the silica nanoparticles, which
are compatible with the polyester resin (bulk). As shown in Figure 9B, using nanoparticles
with medium coverage density (HPC–TPS3, case), a good hydrophobic–hydrophilic
balance between phenyl groups and −OH, respectively, was produced.
Functionalized nanoparticles possess the suitable amount of phenyl
groups per nm2 like to promote their good dispersion into
the polyester matrix, avoiding thus their agglomeration. Consequently,
functionalized nanoparticles can migrate easily through the polymer
to the top surface, enhancing the surface hardness (350 MPa), Young
modulus (10 GPa), and it also promotes a low roughness (3 nm) and
low superficial energy (28 mJ/m2, measured by using a goniometer
and using the Owens–Wendt–Rabel and Kaelble equation).

Meanwhile, in Figure 9A,C when functionalized nanoparticles with a low graft density were
used (HPC–TPS1 case, many available −OH groups without
reacting and/or several unfunctionalized nanoparticles), or in the
opposite case, when functionalized nanoparticles with a high graft
density were used (HPC–TPS5 case, a lot of phenyl groups chemically
attached to the NPSiO2 but some −OH unfunctionalized),
the hydrophobic–hydrophilic balance between phenyl groups and
−OH was lost. Thus, the high density of −OH groups (HPC–TPS1
case) or phenyl groups (HPC–TPS5 case) onto the nanoparticle
surface promotes in both cases their agglomeration by the chemical
affinity between −OH groups or between phenyl groups. Nonetheless,
the presence of phenyl groups promotes the migration of these agglomerates
to the coating surface, propitiating a very rough surface, a high
specific surface energy, a high friction coefficient, but with a slight
improvement in the hardness and Young modulus in the top-coating.

Finally, the interaction between 100Cr6 balls and the HPC surfaces
(HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5) was analyzed. Figure 9D,F shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs corresponding
to the 100Cr6 ball after the tribological test for the samples HPC–TPS1
and HPC–TPS5, respectively. In both cases, coatings debris
surrounding the contact surface of the ball were observed, which is
consistent with the hardness and the roughness obtained by AFM analysis.
These surfaces exhibited a sharp topology with several lumps that
can be breaking or wearing by the action of the load on the ball.
Also, a film transfer on the ball in both cases was not observed.
An SEM micrograph corresponding to the 100Cr6 ball after the tribological
to the sample HPC–TPS3 is shown in Figure 9E. In this case,
does not debris was observed on the contact surface around the ball,
neither does the presence of a film-transfer that could reduce the
friction coefficient.

3 Conclusions
On the
basis of the aforementioned discussion in the previous section,
it could be concluded that a deeper insight regarding how the graft
density (Gφ) of TPS groups onto
NPSiO2 affects the macroscopic properties of HPC is offered
for the first time. Here, several graft densities or coverage density
(from 0.36 up to 0.79 μmol/nm2) of NPSiO2 with TPS were obtained by varying the amount of TPS (1.25, 4.54,
9.07, 13.3 and 18.0 μmol/m2) used in the functionalization
reaction of NPSiO2 under a nucleophilic substitution mechanism
and anhydrous conditions. A “plateau” of maxima functionalization
was reached using 13.3 μmol/m2 of TPS. HPC formulated
with functionalized nanoparticles at a suitable coverage density (Gφ ≈ 0.52 μmol/nm2, HPC–TPS3 case) exhibited significantly low friction coefficient
(μ = 0.12), strong wear resistance (under dry sliding conditions
at 1 and 5 N of load), low roughness (Rq = 3.5 nm), and high hardness and elastic modulus on the surface.
We demonstrated that it is possible to tune the macroscopic properties
by varying only the coverage density of TPS that is chemically attached
to SiO2 nanoparticles. Also, a physicochemical explanation
was disclosed, wherein a hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance between
−OH and phenyl groups was proposed. In all cases, the phenyl
group allows the migration of functionalized nanoparticles through
the polyester matrix, enhancing the hardness and elastic modulus on
the surface. Thus, the functional nanomaterial design with tunable
coverage density is a powerful tool to improve the physical and superficial
properties of powder coatings using low amounts of nanomaterial.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Silica
nanoparticles (NPSiO2, AEROSIL A200, Evonik, ø = 12 nm, 2.75
OH groups/nm2) and a specific surface area 201 m2/g (measured by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, BET) was dried
during 4 h at 150 °C under vacuum before use, in order to remove
the physically adsorbed water. Hydrophobic-fumed silica AEROSIL R972
(fumed silica after being treated with dimethyldichlorosilane) from
Evonik, ø = 16 nm, and BET = 127 m2/g. Toluene anhydrous (99.8 +% Aldrich), TPS (98 +% Aldrich, Mn = 240.37 g/mol), methanol (CH3OH,
99.98 +% T.J. Baker), polyester resin with carboxyl terminal groups
(Sun Polymers International Inc.: Tg =
62 °C, 25–40 mg KOH/g, Mn =
7680 Da, Đ = 1.39), and TGIC (Mn = 7845 Da, Đ = 1.46, Tg = −1.84 °C) as cure agent were
used as received.

4.2 Instrumentation
New functional groups
chemically attached to the silica surface from FSiO2–TPSX|X=1,...,5 were analyzed by
ATR using a Frontier MIR PerkinElmer ATR–FTIR spectrometer
of 4000–400 cm–1 using 12 scans and 0.4 cm–1 of resolution at room temperature. Coverage density
was calculated by TGA and was performed in a TA Instrument SDT Q600
system using alumina crucibles and heating from room temperature up
to 900 °C at 10 °C/min under a feed of ultrahigh purity
nitrogen gas (100 mL/min). Co-rotating twin screw extruder (L/D) = 40 at 120 rpm and 110 °C was
used to obtain all formulations of HPC. Thermal characterization of
formulations of HPC (HPC-A200, HPC-R972, HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5), and control sample (PC, without
nanoparticles) were analyzed by DSC in a TA Instruments DSC Q200 system.
Typically, 1–2 mg of each sample was placed into an aluminum
pan (Tzero) and under nitrogen flux (100 mL/min) was subjected to
the following thermal treatment: (1) a heating (10 °C/min) from
0 °C up to 120 °C; (2) 120 °C isothermal for 1 min;
(3) a cooling at 10 °C/min from 120 °C up to 0 °C;
(4) 0 °C isothermal for 1 min; and (5) a heating at 10 °C/min
over the range of 10 °C up to 300 °C. Thermal transitions
were obtained in the second heating cycle when the polymer thermal
history was eliminated. TGA was performed in a TA Instrument SDT Q600
system using platinum crucibles and heating from room temperature
up to 800 °C at 10 °C/min under a feed of ultrahigh purity
nitrogen gas (100 mL/min). Tribological performance of coatings under
dry sliding condition was evaluated using a ball-on-disc tribometer
(Anton Paar) under ambient conditions (relative humidity of 30–40%)
using loads of 1 and 5 N and a sliding speed of 0.05 m/s and 100Cr6
balls of 6 mm of diameter as counterparts. The radius of the wear
track was set to 7 mm and the sliding distance was 500 m. Friction
force was dynamically measured and the friction coefficients were
obtained when the measured forces were divided by the applied load.
The wear coefficient of each sample was then calculated from the volume
of material lost during the friction run using the following eqs 2 and 3 2   3  where Wrate is
the wear rate coefficient, Vlost is the
volume of material lost, F is the normal load, and s is the sliding distance. R and d are respectively the radius and width of the wear track
and r is the radius of the steel-ball. The wear track
on the ball was observed using a Scanning Electron Microscopy JEOL
6010 system. AFM (Asylum MFP 3D) was used to investigate the roughness
of the coatings, which was correlated with the friction coefficients
obtained. Noncontact (“tapping”) mode was used to obtain
all topographic images using a rectangular cantilever AC160TS-35.
Finally, nano-indentation experiments were carried out using a Hysitron
TI950 Triboindenter (Hysitron Inc., Minneapolis USA) with 150 nm diamond
Berkovich tip. The triboindenter was used in quasi-static indentation
mode in order to measure the elastic modulus (Young modulus) and hardness
of the hybrid powder coating cross-section.

4.3 Functionalization
of NPSiO2 with
TPS
Several levels of graft density (Gφ) were obtained using 0.25, 0.91, 1.82, 2.67, and 3.61
mmol of TPS as revealed in Table 2.

Table 2 Functionalization Reaction Conditions
TAG	NPSiO2 (g)	triethoxyphenylsilane (TPS) (g)	(μmol/m2)a	
FSiO2–TPS1	1	0.06	1.25	
FSiO2–TPS2	1	0.22	4.54	
FSiO2–TPS3	1	0.44	9.07

FSiO2–TPS5	1	0.87	18.0	
a Is the initial alkoxysilane molar
concentration in the feed per unit area of silica surface in μmol/m2.

Thus, NPSiO2 A200 (1 g, previously dried) was placed
into a jacketed glass reactor of 250 mL in the presence of anhydrous
toluene (28.5 mL). The glass reactor equipped with addition funnel,
condenser, and magnetic stirrer was sealed, purged with anhydrous
nitrogen (15 min), and it was immersed in an ultrasonic bath (15 min)
to enhance the nanoparticles dispersion. After that, the mixture was
heated up to 60 °C, and then, the required amount of TPS dissolved
in anhydrous toluene (1 g) was added dropwise. The functionalization
reaction was stirred for 24 h at 60 °C. Functionalized NPSiO2 with TPS (FSiO2–TPS) was isolated by vacuum
filtration using a nylon membrane of 0.2 μm and were washed
exhaustively with methanol (3 times) under vigorous stirring. Finally,
FSiO2–TPS nanoparticles were isolated and dried
during 24 h using a vacuum oven at room temperature and were stored
into a desiccator prior characterization. Thus, five kinds of functionalized
NPSiO2 possessing different graft density (Gφ) were obtained (FSiO2–TPSX|X=1,...,5). Moreover, with
the aim to have enough quantity of functionalized nanoparticles, we
performed a second experimental set, wherein 5 g of FSiO2–TPS1 (low Gφ), FSiO2–TPS3 (medium Gφ),
and FSiO2–TPS5 (high Gφ) were obtained following the same procedure disclosed above. Each
material with different graft density was later incorporated into
a powder coating formulation.

4.4 Grafting
Density Analysis
The graft
density (Gφ) or coverage density
of TPS on the NPSiO2 surface (FSiO2–TPSX|X=1,...,5) was calculated
by TGA using eq 3 4  where WA200 is the weight loss of SiO2 nanoparticles (dihydroxylation)
before functionalization and W60–800 is the weight loss between 60 and 800 °C corresponding to the
thermal decomposition of TPSX|X=1,...,5. Mn is the molecular weight
of the degradable part of the grafted TPS and Sspec is the specific surface area of NPSiO2 A200.
Also, using Gφ, it is possible to
obtain the grafting yield (Gy), which
corresponds to the fraction of alkoxysilane (TPS) attached to the
silica surface with respect to [TPS]0 5  where [TPS]0 is the initial alkoxysilane
molar concentration in the feed per unit area of silica surface in
μmol/m2. On the other hand, according to Mueller
et al.,15 it is feasible to obtain the
OH surface density of pure NPSiO2, which can be calculated
as follows 6  where
wt60 and wt800 represent the sample weights
at the corresponding temperatures, MwH2O is the molecular weight of water, NA is Avogadro’s constant, α = 0.625
is a calibration factor,15 and (#OH/nm2)800 = 1 and represents the number of OH/nm2 remains on the NPSiO2 surface at 800 °C.21

4.5 HPC Formulations
In order to study
the graft density (Gφ) effect over
the macroscopic properties of the powder coatings resulting, we performed
three hybrid powder coating formulations (HPC–TPS1, HPC–TPS3,
and HPC–TPS5) based on (polyester resin/TGIC/degassing &
flowing agents)/FSiO2–TPSX|X=1,3,5, (99.9)/0.1 wt %. Furthermore, silica
nanoparticles A200 and R972 also were used (instead of functionalized
SiO2 nanoparticles) at the same weight content (0.1 wt
%) in order to obtain hybrid powder coating formulations (HPC-A200
and HPC-R972) to make comparisons and to study trends. An additional
powder coating formulation without nanoparticles (PC) as “control
sample” also was done. In all cases, each powder coating formulation
was homogenized using a high-power disperser, which produces a high
shear force to disperse all components. The homogeneous powder dispersion
was subsequently extruded to avoid premature curing of the system.
The hotmelt materials were passed through cooled rollers in order
to obtain hard, cool, and brittle flakes, which were broken into small
flakes using a rotating hammer. The small flakes were then pulverized
in a high-speed lab-mill and were sieved to obtain powder coating
nanocomposites with a particle size of 30–35 μm.

4.6 Coatings Electrostatically Deposited on Carbon
Steel
In all cases, control sample (PC) and HPC obtained
here (HPC-A200, HPC-R972, and HPC–TPSX|X=1,3,5) were applied onto carbon steel sheets
(previously degreased) of 5 cm × 10 cm (width and length) and
2 mm of thickness using a WAGNER electrostatic spray gun (output voltage
of 60 kV). After that, the coated samples were cured for 15 min at
190 °C. The coated samples exhibited a homogenous thickness of
70 ± 6 μm (measured using an Elcometer 456 Coating Thickness
Gauge instrument). Finally, all cured coating samples were characterized
by AFM and tribology.
