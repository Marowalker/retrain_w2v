Cesium lead halide perovskite (CsPbX3, with X = Br,
Cl, I) nanocrystals have been found to undergo severe modifications
under the high-energy electron beam irradiation of a transmission
electron microscope (80/200 keV). In particular, in our previous work,
together with halogen desorption, Pb2+ ions were found
to be reduced to Pb0 and then diffused to form lead nanoparticles
at temperatures above −40 °C. Here, we present a detailed
irradiation study of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals at temperatures
below −40 °C, a range in which the diffusion of Pb0 atoms/clusters is drastically suppressed. Under these conditions,
the irradiation instead induces the nucleation of randomly oriented
CsBr, CsPb, and PbBr2 crystalline domains. In addition
to the Br desorption, which accompanies Pb2+ reduction
at all the temperatures, Br is also desorbed from the CsBr and PbBr2 domains at low temperatures, leading to a more pronounced
Br loss, thus the final products are mainly composed of Cs and Pb.
The overall transformation involves the creation of voids, which coalesce
upon further exposure, as demonstrated in both nanosheets and nanocuboids.
Our results show that although low temperatures hinder the formation
of Pb nanoparticles in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals when irradiated,
the nanocrystals are nevertheless unstable. Consequently, we suggest
that an optimum combination of temperature range, electron energy,
and dose rate needs to be carefully chosen for the characterization
of halide perovskite nanocrystals to minimize both the Pb nanoparticle
formation and the structural decomposition.

Introduction
Research
interest in lead halide perovskites, with the chemical
formula APbX3 (with A+ = CH3NH3+, NH2CH=NH2+, Cs+, and X– = Cl–, Br–, I–), has surged exponentially
over the last few years due to their remarkable performance in both
photovoltaics1−3 and optoelectronics.4−8 However, halide perovskites are known to undergo rapid degradation
under irradiation from several sources (UV and visible light, X-rays,
electrons), heating, or exposure to moisture.3,9−12 In a recent work from our group, we studied the electron beam-induced
transformations of CsPbX3 nanocrystals,99 by means of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
and found that high-energy (80–200 keV) electron irradiation
induces a radiolysis process in which both the halogen desorption
and Pb2+ reduction to Pb0 occur. Our results
were similar to those of the previous works that reported electron-stimulated
desorption processes.13−16 We found that two factors, the incident electron energy and the
substrate temperature, are important in the transformation process
of CsPbX3 nanocrystals: (i) 200 keV electrons induce less
damage than 80 keV electrons and (ii) the rate at which the Pb0 species aggregate into Pb nanoparticles depends on the temperature.
Finally, no Pb nanoparticles were observed below −40 °C.99

In the present study, we focus on the
electron beam-induced transformations
in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals at T ≤
−40 °C, with an incident electron energy of 200 keV. We
demonstrate that the electron beam induces the decomposition of CsPbBr3 and the nucleation of crystalline domains of various compositions
and phases, including CsBr, CsPb, and PbBr2. The CsBr and
PbBr2 domains are unstable under irradiation. It is known
that in alkali halides (e.g., CsBr), stimulated halogen desorption
can be induced by UV laser,17 electron,18,19 or ion irradiation.20 Halogen loss also
occurs for PbX2 under light and electron irradiation.21,22 In the present CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, in addition to the
Br loss accompanying Pb2+ reduction, electron irradiation
induces the desorption of Br from the CsBr and PbBr2 domains.
These two combined processes result in an exceptionally high Br loss
at low temperatures. Our data show that the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals
are unstable even when irradiated at low temperatures, that is, even
if the formation of Pb nanoparticles is hindered under these conditions.
These findings suggest that caution should be taken in the characterization
of halide perovskites involving radiation sources even at low temperatures,
and that an appropriate temperature range needs to be chosen for the
specimen to minimize both Pb nanoparticle formation and structure
decomposition. For instance, for 200 keV electrons in the dose rate
range of 106–107 e–/Å2/s, the optimum temperature is −40 °C.

Results
and Discussion
We studied in detail the transformations induced
in the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with two different morphologies,
namely nanosheets
(rectangular shaped, ∼3 nm thick, with lateral sizes ranging
from hundreds of nanometers up to a few micrometers) and nanocuboids
(an edge length of 20–40 nm), to appreciate the possible effects
of the surface-to-volume ratio, reported to affect the damage rate
in our recent work.99 The details of the
synthesis procedures are reported in the Experimental
Section.

Electron Irradiation of CsPbBr3 Nanosheets (Two-Dimensional
(2D) Case)
High-angle annular dark field-scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM)
images of a CsPbBr3 nanosheet were acquired by increasing
the electron dose, that is, increasing the exposure time with a fixed
dose rate (see Figure 1). The methods for calculation of dose and dose rate are explained
in detail in the Experimental Section. All
of the images reported in Figure 1 were recorded at a sample temperature of −90
°C. At first, the surface of the investigated nanosheet became
rough and then the nanosheet turned into a porous structure composed
of many nanometer-sized domains. The morphological evolution of the
nanosheets at other temperatures is reported in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information (SI).

Figure 1 HAADF-STEM images showing
the morphological evolution of a CsPbBr3 nanosheet at −90
°C with increases in the electron
dose.

To elucidate the nature of the
nanometer-sized domains in the porous
structure, the evolution of selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
patterns from the nanosheets at increasing irradiation doses throughout
the whole investigated temperature range were acquired and are summarized
in Figure S2 of the SI. The results of
these analyses indicate that, as long as the sample temperature was
below −40 °C, the samples underwent similar transformations
under irradiation.

The azimuthal integrations (Figure 2a) of four sequential SAED
patterns (A–D in Figure 2b) of a single nanosheet
at −120 °C show that the nanosheet loses its perovskite
structure rapidly, with new diffraction peaks appearing. The comparison
with the reference data from the ICSD database reveals that, among
the new peaks (labeled in Figure 2a), peak 1 mainly arises from CsBr, peak 2 corresponds
to CsPb, and peaks 3 and 4 result from both CsPb and PbBr2. In particular, CsPb is an equiatomic semiconducting Zintl alloy,
in which each Cs is tetrahedrally coordinated with a [Pb4]4− tetrahedral polyanion cluster, and the valence
electrons of the Cs atoms are transferred to the lead clusters.23 The formation of CsPb likely arises from the
bonding of the Pb4 clusters with the surrounding Cs+ ions. This is because the Pb diffusion is drastically reduced
below −40 °C, favoring the clustering process instead,
with the formation of CsPb particles. In the studied temperature range,
it is known that no phase transitions occur in CsBr, CsPb, and PbBr2. The powder-diffraction X-ray diffraction data from the ICSD
database for these three compounds, which were taken at room temperature
(RT), are a good approximation of the crystal structure below −40
°C. (See more about the crystal structure of CsBr nanocrystals
at different temperatures in Figure S3 of
the SI.)

and PbBr2 (ICSD: 202134). (c) Zoomed-in view of the white-boxed
regions in high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (inset) performed on
a corner region at −60 °C, showing the appearance of CsPb,
CsBr, and PbBr2 crystalline domains.

High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analyses further confirmed the
formation
of CsPb, CsBr, and PbBr2 domains (Figure 2c). Br and Pb atoms at the corners and edges
of CsPbBr3 nanosheets have a lower coordination, and their
electronic configuration can be more easily altered by electron irradiation.99 As a result, the CsPb crystals appeared first
at the edge of nanosheets and later in the inner regions (Figure 2c). The decomposition
and recrystallization of CsPbBr3 into these nanodomains
is driven by the organization of the system into a more favorable
state through the ionizing radiation-induced elemental diffusion.24 This type of behavior is not at all limited
to CsPbBr3 because various works on different materials
have reported the decomposition and crystallization under electron
irradiation from the starting single crystals into nanodomains. These
nanodomains could have either the original composition and crystal
structure of the initial crystal, or even different ones.24−27

Among the new peaks appearing in Figure 2a, the intensity of the dominant peak from
CsBr (peak 1) decreases when increasing the electron dose. This is
due to the decomposition of the CsBr domains upon further electron
irradiation (see Figure S4 of the SI).
The instability of CsBr under electron irradiation at the same temperature
and at the same level of electron irradiation was investigated with
the experiments conducted on pure CsBr nanocrystals, for which the
syntheses are found in the Experimental Section. These were found to turn into hollow particles under electron irradiation,
accompanied by the loss of Br, with only the Cs species remaining.
The reader is referred to Figures S5 and S6 for the structural evolution and electron-stimulated Br desorption
from pure CsBr nanocrystals. The PbBr2 domains are also
not stable under further electron irradiation (see Figure S7 of the SI). Consequently, the Br loss from the CsPbBr3 nanosheet below −40 °C was much more significant
than at higher temperatures (such as −10 °C and RT), as
demonstrated by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) study
later in the article. Figure 3 reports the variation in Br concentration (in atom %) from
the quantification of the EDS spectra obtained by increasing the electron
dose on a single CsPbBr3 nanosheet (see Figure S8 of the SI). The Br concentration decreased from
58 to 20% when the temperature was below −40 °C; for comparison,
variations in the Br concentration at −10 °C and at RT
are also shown in Figure 3: it is evident that the concentration remained around 58%
in those cases.

One may argue that the decomposition may be due
to electron beam
induced contamination. In a TEM, the electron beam causes the formation
of hydrocarbon ions by reacting with stray hydrocarbons in the path,
which then condense into a carbon-rich polymerized film. The local
decrease in temperature would accelerate this deposition of the contamination
on top of the sample surface, which could help to increase the decomposition
rate. However, in the present work, the presence of contaminants from
the residual gas is strongly reduced by a liquid nitrogen–cooled
cryogenic trap close to the objective polepieces. Moreover, the contamination
is mostly removed by irradiating the sample at low magnification before
the measurements (namely beam showering) via hydrocarbon cracking.28 Therefore, the acceleration of decomposition
at lower temperatures is not likely contributed by the contaminants.

Overall, we conclude that under electron irradiation below −40
°C, the CsPbBr3 nanosheets transformed into randomly
oriented CsBr, PbBr2, and CsPb domains. Subsequently, CsBr
and PbBr2 decomposed under further irradiation and resulted
in a porous morphology.

Electron Irradiation of CsPbBr3 Nanocuboids (Three-Dimensional
(3D) Case)
To generalize the above electron beam-induced
transformation of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals at low temperatures,
we also conducted the same study on a different morphology. Figure 4a reports the evolution
of CsPbBr3 nanocuboids under electron irradiation at −60
°C, at which an interesting morphological change occurred. The
CsPbBr3 nanocuboids first became rounder due to the preferential
Pb2+ reduction and Br desorption occurring at the undercoordinated
sites at the corners. Then, the nanocrystals transformed into hollow
nanostructures under further irradiation. The transformation of nanocuboids
at all of the temperatures below −40 °C followed a similar
path, as reported in Figure S9 in the SI.
In analogy with the 2D case, CsBr, CsPb, and PbBr2 domains
were formed, which is shown in the zoomed-in view of several subsequently
acquired HRTEM images of a CsPbBr3 nanocuboid (Figure 4b). The HRTEM analysis
indicated that the CsPbBr3 nanocuboids were enclosed by
the {001}, {110}, and {11̅0} facets with the orthorhombic phase
(Figure S10). The models for various crystal
structures involved were built using VESTA29 and are shown in Figure 4c. In particular, the CsBr domain has an epitaxial relationship
with the parent lattice in the CsPbBr3 structure: CsBr
(100)//CsPbBr3 (200) and CsBr [01̅1]//CsPbBr3 [001]. The models illustrate that the “reshaping”
process of the nanocuboids is enabled by the formation of new crystalline
domains. The effect is more noticeable in the 3D case than in the
2D case (nanosheets) due to the presence of extended surfaces in all
of the three orthogonal directions in the 3D case. Similar to the
2D case, the overall elemental analysis of the nanocuboids indicates
that, under electron irradiation below −40 °C, the Cs/Pb/Br
ratio (atom %) changed from the initial stoichiometry (1:1:3) to 1:1:0.3,
corresponding to a Br loss of as high as 90%.

electron dose at −60 °C. (a) HAADF-STEM images. (b) Zoomed-in
view of the white-boxed region of the HRTEM images (inset) demonstrating
the four domains formed on a CsPbBr3 nanocuboid under irradiation
(at the condition of imaging). (c) Crystal structure models of the
initial perovskite structure and the four domains generated.

A question may arise whether the
different illumination conditions
have different damage behaviors on the perovskite nanocrystals: HRTEM
(wide-beam illumination) and STEM (scanning probe). The local dose
in HRTEM conditions is lower, but the sample is under continuous exposure,
whereas the local dose in the STEM is much higher, but the structure
can relax before the probe reaches that point again. This is evaluated
by observing the evolution of nanocuboids, which is reported in Figure S11 of the SI, under different illumination
conditions. It is found that the nanocuboids evolve into hollow morphologies
at low temperatures in all of the cases. However, a slight difference
was observed: the hollow structure is round in shape in the STEM mode,
whereas the edges of the hollow structure tends to be faceted in the
HRTEM mode. This is because the electrons continuously impact on the
sample in the HRTEM mode, and the decomposed products crystallize,
which gives rise to the faceted edges.

At higher temperatures
(i.e., RT), the nanocuboids with 20–40
nm edges experienced much less damage (i.e., Br loss) than the 3 nm
thick nanosheets,99 whereas the damage
at lower temperatures (below −40 °C) was equal for these
two morphologies due to the hollowing process. A brief comparison
shows that the effect of surface-to-volume ratio of the perovskite
nanocrystal does not play a relevant role with regards to the electron
beam-induced damage at low temperatures.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, the transformation process of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals
under electron beam irradiation at low temperatures
reveals a very different scenario to that of the higher temperatures.
The formation of Pb nanoparticles reaches a possible (final) stable
stage at T > −40 °C. However, at T ≤ −40 °C, the decomposed products crystallize
into several compounds under electron irradiation, including CsPb,
PbBr2, and CsBr, favored by the limited diffusion of Pb.
Electron irradiation further causes the desorption of Br from the
CsBr and PbBr2 domains. The Br loss is consequently much
more significant than in the high-temperature case. Voids are formed
and coalesce, and finally give rise to porous and hollow morphologies,
both in the 2D case (nanosheets) and the 3D case (nanocuboids). The
present findings will most likely apply to other types of perovskite
and perovskite-related materials.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Cobalt(II) bromide (CoBr2, 99%),
cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, reagentPlus, 99%),
1-octadecene (ODE, technical grade, 90%), oleylamine (OlAm, 70%),
oleic acid (OlAc, 90%), and toluene (anhydrous, 99.8%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the chemicals were used without any further
purification.

Synthesis
Rectangular CsPbBr3 nanosheets
∼3 nm thick, with lateral sizes ranging from hundreds of nanometers
up to a few micrometers, were synthesized by a colloidal procedure
reported elsewhere.30 CsPbBr3 nanocuboids with an edge length of 20–40 nm were synthesized
by a colloidal procedure similar to the one reported recently,99,31 with the difference being that the synthesis was performed at room
temperature (RT).99 CsBr nanocrystals were
synthesized by a colloidal approach in which 0.087 g CoBr2 was dissolved in 2 mL ODE together with 1 mL OlAm and 1 mL OlAc
at 100 °C. Then, after the complete solubilization of CoBr2 salt, a 0.5 mL Cs-oleate solution (0.325 g Cs2CO3 dissolved in 5 mL oleic acid) was quickly injected.
Five minutes later, the reaction mixture was cooled by immersing the
flask in a water bath. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded
and the particles were redispersed in toluene.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM)
The nanocrystals
were deposited on an ultrathin carbon film supported on a holey carbon
film coating 400 mesh TEM copper grids. The electron beam irradiation
experiments were conducted in a 200 kV TEM (JEOL JEM-2200FS) equipped
with a spherical aberration corrector (CEOS) for the objective lens
and an in-column image filter (Ω-type). A Gatan cryotransfer
holder (model 626) with liquid nitrogen cooling, equipped with a Model
900 Smartset cold stage controller, was used for observing the electron
beam-induced transformation at different temperatures in the range
of −180 °C < T < 25 °C. The
use of a direct detection camera could significantly reduce the dose
rate and slow down the damage process reported here, but the damage
could not be removed completely. Because we aimed at observing the
effect of irradiation, a CCD camera with 2048 × 2048 pixel (UltraScan
1000, Gatan Inc.) resolution was used to record the HRTEM images.
The SAED patterns were acquired by filtering the elastically scattered
electrons through a 20 eV energy slit. The corresponding profiles
were obtained by azimuthal integration and background subtraction
using the PASAD plugin.32 The STEM images
were acquired in HAADF mode to enhance the compositional variations
in the image contrast. The dose rate range used is 106–107 e–/Å2/s. A Bruker Quantax
400 system with an XFlash 5060 detector was used for the EDS. The
nanocrystals’ composition was estimated from the EDS spectra
in the thin-film approximation (Cliff-Lorimer) by fitting the Cs Lα,
Pb Lα, and Br Kα lines with a relative error of 10% for
Cs, 10% for Pb, and 4% for Br, evaluated as the standard deviation
in the fit.

Dose Calculation
The CCD camera
with 2048 × 2048
pixel (UltraScan 1000, Gatan Inc.) resolution was calibrated using
the direct electron detection camera (K2 Summit, Gatan Inc.) for which
the number of electrons can be directly counted (when used in counting/super-resolution
mode).

In the TEM mode, an image is acquired under the same
condition as for irradiation. From image parameters read from Digital
Micrograph: counts C that represents the number of
electrons per pixel for acquisition dwell time, pixel number N, irradiation time t, acquisition time T, and acquisition area A, the accumulated
dose D is calculated based on the following equation  In
the STEM mode, we first measure the probe
current using the following method: acquire a TEM image of the STEM
probe on UltraScan 1000, read the counts C (number
of electrons per pixel in the acquisition dwell time) and pixel number N, the probe current I is calculated by
the equation  With a spot size of 1.5 nm and a convergence
semiangle of 16 mrad, the probe current is 68 pA (corresponding to
a current density of 3.8 × 103 A/cm2).

The probe current can be changed by selecting the spot size. On
the basis of the probe current and irradiation time t and scan area A, the accumulated dose D is calculated using the equation
