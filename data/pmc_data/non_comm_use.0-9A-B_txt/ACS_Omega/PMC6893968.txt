Antiviral therapy is crucial for the circumvention of
viral epidemics. The
unavailability of a specific antiviral drug against the chikungunya
virus (CHIKV) disease has created an alarming situation to identify
or develop potent chemical molecules for remedial management of CHIKV.
In the present investigation, in silico
studies of dihydrorugosaflavonoid derivatives (5a–f) with non-structural protein-3 (nsP3) were carried out.
nsP3 replication protein has recently been considered as a possible
antiviral target in which crucial inhibitors fit into the adenosine-binding
pocket of the macrodomain. The 4′-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids
displayed intrinsic binding with the nsp3 macrodomain (PDB ID: 3GPO)
of CHIKV. Compounds 5c and 5d showed docking
scores of −7.54 and −6.86 kcal mol–1, respectively. Various in vitro assays were performed to confirm
their (5a–f) antiviral potential
against CHIKV. The non-cytotoxic dose was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide assay and was found to be <100 μM. The compounds 5c and 5d showed their inhibitory potential for
CHIKV, which was determined
through cytopathic effect assay and plaque reduction assay, which
show inhibition up to 95 and 92% for 70 μM concentration of
the compounds, respectively. The quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction assay result confirmed the ability of 5c and 5d to reduce the viral RNA level at 70 μM
concentration
of compounds to nearly 95 and 93% concentration, respectively, in
cells with CHIKV infection. Further, the CHIKV-inhibitory capacity
of these compounds was corroborated by execution of immunofluorescence
assay. The executed work will be meaningful for the future research
of studied dihydrorugosaflavonoids against prime antiviral entrants,
leading to remedial management
to preclude CHIKV infection.

Introduction
The cases of chikungunya viral fever are
burgeoning every year. Infections are not only limited to Asia and
Africa; recently, the epidemics of chikungunya have been reported
from Central and South America.1,2 Concerning the data
obtained from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme
(NVBDCP, India), the number of infected people identified in April
2018 was 9175, 4875 from Karnataka following 1375 from Gujarat and
966 from Maharashtra. Earlier research studies have shown that there
is considerable resource burden from chikungunya outbreaks, which
escalates in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Therefore, cases of
chikungunya viral fever have increased in the continent of Asia and
various parts of the world. The name chikungunya originates from “Makonde”,
meaning “to become twisted”. It denotes the “curved”
appearance of those going through joint ache as a result of chikungunya
infection. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spreads by mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The common eukaryotic hosts are primates and humans. In humans,
the symptoms associated with CHIKV are nausea, fever, joint pain,
vomiting, rashes, and persistent arthralgia. Clinical manifestation
is one of the bases for the diagnosis of chikungunya infection, but
the confirmation of disease can only be made after laboratory tests.
Suspected cases are validated by positive anti-Chikungunya virus IgM
or IgG results or by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results.3,4

In Togaviridae family, CHIKV comes under the genus Alphavirus.
Alphaviruses are configured as enveloped positive-sense single-stranded
RNA viruses. There are 29 members in the alphavirus genus; some members
of the genus contain several animal and human viruses like Ross River
virus, Sindbis virus (SINV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV),
Semiliki Forest virus (SFV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus
(VEEV), etc. They are furthermore categorized into Old World and New
World viruses reliant on the changes that occurred in their life cycle,
fatality, and clinical manifestations. Basically, the Old World viruses
CHIKV, SINV, SFV, etc. engage the protein nsp2 to downregulate the
host cell transcription, have less demise percentage, and stimulate
arthralgia. The New World viruses VEEV, WEEV, etc. use virus capsid
protein (CP) to downregulate the host cell transcription, have high
casualty frequency, and generate encephalitis.

Crystallographic
studies and cryoelectron microscopy of different alphaviruses and
their proteins deliver vital information regarding the molecular organization
and the distribution of the virion structural portions.5−12 Encapsidated by 240 copies of CP, the RNA genome of CHIKV makes
the nucleocapsid core.13,14 The grown-up alphavirus virion
(70 nm in diameter) has an envelope, which is derived from the host,
having T = 4 icosahedral symmetry embedded with 80
spikes. Trimers of E1 and E2 (surface glycoproteins) heterodimers
build up every spike.15 CHIKV bears a genome
of almost ∼11.7 kb, polyadenylated at the 3′ end and
capped at the 5′ end. The non-structural polyproteins (nsP1234)
are encoded by the 5′ two-third open reading frame (ORF) of
the genome. The three chief structural proteins (capsid (C), E1, and
E2) are encoded by the 3′ one-third ORF of the genome.16 The functioning of non-structural protein (nsP)
promotes the construction of distinct mature non-structural proteins
(nsp1–4). nsP1 is the capping enzyme, nsP2 is the viral helicase
and protease, and nsP4 is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has
an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain.17 The role of nsP3 was not very well defined. However, recently,
McPherson et al.18 have reported that CHIKV’s
nsP3 macrodomain hydrolyzes ADP-ribose groups from mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated
proteins and the activity of nsP3 mono(ADP-ribosyl)hydrolase is somewhere
decisive for CHIKV replication and virulence in mice. At the N-terminus,
nsP3 encompasses a very preserved MacroD-type macrodomain. The protein
fold in the macrodomain is remarkably conserved, which is present
in numerous plus-strand RNA viruses, and it attaches to ADP-ribose.
Mutant viruses missing hydrolase activity were incapable of replicating
in mammalian BHK-21 cells or mosquito, A. albopictus, cells and quickly regressed the catalytically inactivated mutants.

Despite the increasing number of chikungunya patients, haplessly,
to date, no antiviral remedy or vaccine is available in the market
for the cure of CHIKV-infected patients. Some CHIKV vaccine approaches
have been analyzed, together with inefficient, live weakened, and
DNA chimeric vaccines. However, questions associated with protection
and efficiency have stalled the development of current vaccine entrants.19,20 Besides, drugs testified via in vitro screening of chloroquine,
ribavirin, and arbidol to curb CHIKV progress have failed to produce
noteworthy therapeutic aids in clinical samples.21−24 In the recent past, high-throughput
assays have been established to figure out probable inhibitors of
CHIKV. Literature search has provided the information regarding analysis
of 356 natural product molecules and clinically recommended medicines
to counteract CHIKV replicon, and an accompanying test with the surrogate
infection model of Semliki Forest virus (SFV),25 during analyses of 3040 small compounds as inhibitors of
CHIKV nsP2, was also tested by the phenotypic assay protocol.26 Still, the problem for the prevention and treatment
of
CHIKV fever is recalcitrant. Therefore, it is necessary to work in
a streamlined manner to overcome this severe menace.

Flavones
are naturally occurring polyphenolic secondary metabolites that exist
all over in plants. They have shown enormous potential in the field
of medicinal chemistry.27 They are very
beneficial in our daily life28 to boost
up immunity and can be used as a preventive measure for various ailments,
by consuming flavone-rich products such as green tea, fruits, etc.
In our laboratory, we had prepared naturally occurring rugosaflavonoid
and its derivatives.29,30 Before formation of rugosaflavonoids,
we had
obtained dihydrorugosaflavonoids (Scheme 1).30,31 We had screened these
compounds for tuberculosis in our previous studies, and we found that
halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids were much better antitubercular
agents than rugosaflavonoids.31

Scheme 1 Schematic
Depiction of the Synthesis of Dihydrorugosaflavonoids30,31
Due to nonavailability of the antiviral drug
against CHIKV, mostly natural compounds have been subjected to screening
for antiviral activity to obtain lead molecules using high-throughput
assays.32−35 Therefore, in this study, we have checked the antiviral potential
of our compounds against the CHIKV. First, using molecular docking,
the target site for the compounds was identified in CHIKV. The non-structural
viral proteins have a crucial role in the replication and survival
of CHIKV. Among nsP1–nsP4, nsP3 has a natural ligand ADP-ribose
that binds to its macrodomain, which is highly conserved.36 The docking of these compounds into the nsP3
macrodomain indicated that the halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids
interacted and fitted more effectively in its pocket. This binding
property of halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids with nsP3 invigorated
us to screen these compounds for antiviral efficacy against CHIKV.

In this study, the docking potential of dihydrorugosaflavonoid
derivatives with the macrodomain of nsP3 and their antiviral potential
against CHIKV are reported. Based on the outcomes of antiviral screening
using CHIKV-infected Vero cells, the dihydrorugosaflavonoids were
assessed with several assays. The cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition
and plaque reduction assays were conducted to determine the inhibitory
potential of compounds on CHIKV replication, and quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to assess the reduction
of viral RNA levels in the infected cells. An immunofluorescence assay
(IFA) was carried out to investigate the reduction in CHIKV antigen
upon treatment with the screened compounds.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
The dihydrorugosaflavonoid moiety has three
rings A, B, and C (Figure 1).30,31 All of the synthesized compounds
have dissimilarities in ring B. The ring A has a hydroxyl group at
the 7th position and an ester group at the 5th position.
Rest of the changes are only in ring B with differently substituted
benzene. They were obtained during the synthesis of analogues of rugosaflavonoid
(6a–f) as an intermediate before
the synthesis of the final product (Scheme 1).31

Figure 1 Basic backbone
of dihydrorugosaflavonoid and ADP-ribose with numbering. Note: This
figure has similarity with that in our previous paper, which has been
shown
in ref (31). ADP-ribose
is a known structure, which has been drawn by us and also shown in
ref (47).

As per Gaspar et al.,27 flavonoids are still a valid scaffold in medicinal chemistry. Recently,
Lani et al. have published the antiviral potential of baicalein and
fisetin against CHIKV.34 These compounds
possessed the same backbone, so it was pertinent to check their inhibitory
potential for CHIKV. Recently, the synthesis of these compounds has
been reported by our group.30 All of the
spectral data have been provided in the Supporting Information (Supporting Information File 1).

In Silico Studies
Molecular Docking of nsP3 with Halogenated Dihydrorugosaflavonoids
The nsP3 has three key domains, a central zinc-binding region,
a very conserved N-terminal macrodomain, and a poorly conserved, not
properly structured acidic and highly phosphorylated C-terminal domain.
The functions of various cellular proteins to influence signaling,
stress granule assembly, and viral replication are controlled by the
C-terminal domain.35,36 The exact role of the central
zinc-binding region and N-terminal macrodomain is not well categorized.
Macrodomains are known to have a conserved protein fold detected from
archaea to higher eukaryotes considered for their affinity to the
small molecule ADP-ribose and its analogues. In positive-strand RNA
viruses such as alphaviruses, coronaviruses, and hepatitis E virus,
the macrodomains are the integral part of the nsPs.37−46 According to Rungrotmongkol et al.,47 the molecular understanding of the particular binding of ADP-ribose
to the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain revealed that nsP3 amino acids Asp 10,
Ile 11, Asn 24, Asp 31, Gly 32, Val 33, Cys 34, Ser 110–Tyr
114, Val 133, and Arg 144 act as the critical residues in the binding
pocket, which make molecular contacts with the ligand. Also, the ribose
and diphosphate units of the ADP-ribose were found to play a significant
role in making molecular contacts with the amino acid residues of
nsP3 in the CHIKV nsP3–ADP-ribose complex (Figure 2a,b).

Figure 2 Molecular docking of
nsP3 with natural ligand ADP-ribose and dihydrorugosaflavonoids. (a)
Two-dimensional image of ligand interaction of nsp3 with ADP-ribose
in the binding pocket; (b) three-dimensional ligand interaction diagram
of nsP3 with ADP-ribose showing critical residues of nsP3 (binding
pocket) such as residues Asp 10, Ile 11, Arg 144 (with adenine), Asn
24, Asp 31–Cys 34 (with sugar moiety), Ser 110–Tyr 114,
and Leu 108 (with phosphate group) entailed in interactions with ADP-ribose;
(c) interactions of the chloro derivative of dihydrorugosaflavonoid
(5c) with nsp3, with hydrogen bonds shown in blue and
halogen bonds in gray; and (d) interactions of the bromo derivative
of dihydrorugosaflavonoid (5d) with nsp3.

The chloro derivative of dihydrorugosaflavonoid
(5c) showed interaction of halogen with Arg 144 (Figure 2c). The carbonyl
oxygen of ring C formed hydrogen bonds with Ser 110, Thr 111, and
Gly 112. Asp 10 and Ile 11 are also nearby. Val 33 interacted with
ring oxygen. 5c also showed bonding with Leu 109. Thr
114 interacted with the carboxylate group attached with ring A. All
of these amino acid residues of the binding pocket are critical and
are also active in the binding of nsp3 macrodomain with ADP-ribose
(Table 2).

The
bromo derivative of rugosaflavonoid (5d) showed binding
in the potential site pocket of the nsp3 macrodomain and showed interactions
with Asn 24, Gly 112, and Asp 31 (Figure 2d). The docking scores of 5c and 5d were found to be −7.54 and −6.86
kcal mol–1, respectively (Table 1). These effective binding interactions (Table 2) indicate that these compounds may interfere with the function
of nsP3 macrodomain and thus inhibit the replication of CHIKV. Therefore,
to evaluate the inhibitory potential of halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids
against CHIKV, the antiviral assays were performed using Vero cell
lines by observing the cytopathic effect (CPE), plaque reduction assay,
the quantification of the viral genome RNA by qRT-PCR, and using immunofluorescence
imaging.

ADME/T Analysis
In the process of drug discovery development,
various rules were considered but suffered various limitations.48 Therefore, a combination of pharmacodynamics
(PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK), which explains the interaction of
an organism with the drug, is important to be studied. PD evaluates
what the drug does to the body, and PK explains how body responds
to the drug. The main
components of PK are absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
(ADME), finally associated with toxicity (ADMET). Although ADME properties
explain the utmost pharmacological performance of small molecules,
the toxicology study
ensures no injury to the organism with no side effects. According
to Hodgson, “A chemical cannot be a drug, no matter how active
nor how specific its action, unless it is also taken appropriately
into the body (absorption), distributed to the right parts of the
body, metabolized in a way that does not instantly remove its activity,
and eliminated in a suitable manner—a drug must get in, move
about, hang around, and then get out”.49 Haplessly, to address all of these parameters is time-consuming
and cumbersome due to the intricacy of human body, where all of these
parameters affect each other. It has not only limitations to interactions
within the body but also several restrictions due to gender, age,
genetic state, disease, etc. In this case, in silico technologies
can be helpful to compute these calculations based on the mathematical
algorithm used in the in silico software. Although it does not give
full guaranty that it is going to work 100% in the living system,
it saves our time in the selection of molecule to be considered for
further studies. Therefore, ADME/T properties were studied using Qikprop
software of Maestro.

In Table 3,31 values of parameters
such as QP log Po/w, QP log HERG, QPP
Caco, QP log BB, QPP MDCK, QP log Kp,
QP log Khsa, and percentage of human oral
absorption are shown for compounds 5a–f. QP log Po/w reports the expected octanol/water partition
coefficient. Its range should be −2 to 6.5. The values for 5a–f obtained were between 2.2 and 2.7.
QP log HERG predicts IC50 values for the
blockage of HERG K+ channels. Its defined range is above −5.0.
The values obtained for dihydrorugosaflavonids were between −4.7
and −4.8, which are above −5.0. QPP Caco gives an idea
about the apparent Caco-2 cell permeability in nm s–1. The Caco-2 cell is a model for the gut–blood barrier. Below
25, it is considered as poor, and above 500, it is considered as significantly
good. Its computational values for compounds 5a–f were found to be between 318 and 411, which are not great
but not poor also. QP log BB calculates the brain–blood partition
coefficient. Its acceptable range is −3 to 1.2. The compounds
(5a–f) under study showed these values
from −1.13 to −0.76. QPP MDCK predicts apparent MDCK
cell permeability in nm s–1/MDCK cell, which is
identified to be a good
imitator for the blood–brain barrier. Its acceptable range
is 25–500. Its values for dihydrorugosaflavonoids (5a–f) were obtained between 150 and 465. QP log
KP predicts the skin permeability. Its acceptable range is −8
to −1.0. For compounds 5a–f, its values were obtained between −2.9 and −2.1. QP log Khsa predicts affinity toward human serum albumin. Its tolerable
limit is −1.5 to 1.5. For compounds 5a–f, its values ranged between 0.68 and 0.207. It is mentioned
that the percentage of human oral absorption range of 25% is weak
and 80% is significant. For compounds 5a–f, these values were obtained between 88.32 and 90.67. These
results support that the compounds have all of the values in the acceptable
range.

Antiviral Studies
Cell Cytotoxicity Testing
The tetrazolium-based cell
viability assay was conducted to investigate and detect the maximum
nontoxic dose (MNTD) for both the compounds 5c and 5d. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay is dependent on the reaction of water-soluble
compound (MTT) with an insoluble formazan product by viable cells
with active metabolic activity. Thus, the color produced due to the
formation of formazan is a suitable marker of only viable cells. Different
concentrations of the 5c and 5d compounds
were assessed by MTT assay at 24 h. Both compounds did not display
toxicity up to 85 μM as >70% of Vero cells were viable (Figure 3a,b). Half-maximal
cytotoxicity (CC50) was calculated from the plotted graph
and represented as a dotted line. So, all of the antiviral assays
were performed using 30–70 μM concentration of both the
compounds.

by the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and Dunnett’s
post-test. ***P < 0.0001. Values are mean ±
standard deviation of two experiments, which are performed in triplicates.
VC is the virus control.

Assessment of Antiviral Activity via Cytopathic Effect
After evaluation of MNTD for both the compounds, the different non-cytotoxic
concentrations of 5c and 5d compounds were
screened on virus-infected Vero cells to find out the possible effects
of the compounds. Viral-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) assay was
evaluated at 48 hpi (Supporting Information File 1). The compounds 5c and 5d exhibited
a significant reduction of CHIKV-induced CPE at less than 70 μM
concentration.

Plaque Reduction Assay
The reduction in the CHIKV infectivity
in the presence of 5c and 5d compounds was
assessed by plaque reduction assay. In the case of 5c-compound-treated CHIKV, virus inhibition was observed nearly up
to 95% at 70 μM, 88% at 50 μM, and 80% at 30 μM
concentration, while 5d-treated-CHIKV showed 92% at 70
μM, 86% at 50 μM, and 84% at 30 μM, as compared
to control (Figure 3). Other compounds (5a, 5b, 5e, and 5f) did not show inhibition of CHIKV.

The
effective concentration (EC50) of 5c and 5d was determined from antiviral curves. The EC50 of 5c compound was 26.14 μM (Figure 4a) with a selectivity index (CC50/EC50) of 4.33 (CC50 = 113.4 μM (Figure 3a)). The EC50 of 5d compound was 28.39 μM (Figure 4b; selectivity index = 4.19; CC50 = 119 μM (Figure 3b)). The reported EC50 values are the means of
two experiments, which are performed in triplicates. It clearly shows
that 4′-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids (5c and 5d) possess better inhibitory potential than other
substituted dihydrorugosaflavonoid compounds for CHIKV.

Figure 4 Demonstration
of antiviral activity against CHIKV in treated Vero cells. Dihydrorugosaflavonoid-treated
Vero cells (pretreated cells) were infected with CHIKV at an MOI of
1 for 90 min. Followed by virus adsorption, the infection medium was
changed with the medium containing compounds for 24 h. After 24 hpi,
the supernatant was collected for determining percent reduction of
viral titer by plaque reduction assay: (a) 5c compound;
(b) 5d compound. The graphs show the dose-dependent curves
of 5c and 5d. In the analysis, EC50 values of 5c and 5d are 26.14 and 28.39
μM, respectively. EC50 thresholds are marked with
a dotted line. Statistical significance is analyzed by nonlinear regression
(curve fit). Values are mean ± standard deviation of two experiments,
which are performed in triplicates.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Conventional RT-PCR methods
are still one of the reliable diagnostic methods for studying viral
load in supernatants and clinical samples. Here, qRT-PCR was used
for validating the antiviral effect of 5c and 5d by quantifying CHIKV RNA levels in the infected cells. The reduction
in the viral RNA level was observed when treated with 5c and 5d compounds at 24 hpi. The CHIKV RNA levels upon
treatment with 70 and 50 μM 5c were reduced to
closely 95 and 90%, respectively, whereas in case of 5d, with 70 and 50 μM, the RNA levels of CHIKV were reduced to
∼ 93 and 91%, respectively (Figure 5).

of Vero cells treated with 5c and 5d compounds,
by real-time PCR. Compounds were added to the cells 12 h before CHIKV
infection and were present in the post-infection medium. Viral RNA
in infected cells was quantified 24 h post-infection using β-actin
as endogenous control by qRT-PCR performed in triplicates. By using
the comparative Ct method, the relative amount of mRNA was calculated.
The fold change in treated cells was compared with virus control and
is presented logarithmically. Statistical significance is analyzed
by the one-way ANOVA test and Dunnett’s post-test. ***P < 0.0001. Values are the mean ±standard deviation
of two experiments, which are performed in triplicates.

Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA)
Immunofluorescence staining
allows rapid diagnosis of viral antigen in the infected cell using
monoclonal antibodies against the virus-specific antigen. One of the
two envelope glycoproteins present in the chikungunya virus named
E2 glycoprotein has been used as the viral antigen in this study for
virus detection by IFA. Here, CHIKV at an MOI of 1 was propagated
in Vero cells for 36 h with 5c and 5d compounds
at 70 and 50 μM concentrations. IFA measured detection of the
intracellular virus
with an envelope-specific monoclonal antibody (E2 mAb). Additionally,
no E2-expression was visualized in a negative control sample, while
CHIKV-infected cells were positive for E2-expression. Figure 6 clearly shows that both 5c and 5d compounds inhibited CHIKV at 70 and
50 μM concentrations.

Figure 6 Evaluation of the antiviral effect by indirect
immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Viral inhibition was assessed by IFA
by treatment with 5c and 5d compounds. Cells
were observed at 36 hpi; micrographs with green fluorescence indicate
the virus load as determined with anti-E2 mAb and fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) conjugated secondary antibody (green), and blue fluorescence
indicates the nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). Infected Vero cells with compound treatment (5c, 70 μM (c); 5c, 50 μM (d); 5d, 70 μM (e); 5d, 50 μM (f)) and cell control
(containing no virus (a)) are shown. Virus control images are represented
in (b). Cells were observed by a fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems)
with a 20× objective lens. Scale bar is 50 μm.

Due to nonavailability of an antiviral drug or
vaccine against CHIKV, various approaches have been considered all
over the world to identify the lead molecules restricting CHIKV infection
or replication. In this piece of work, molecular docking of dihydrorugosaflavonoids
with nsP3 showed their interaction with the key residues of nsP3 that
bind ADP, which supports the possibility and indicates that these
compounds are potential antivirals for CHIKV. This is confirmed in
this study by performing various antiviral assays. The CPE and plaque
reduction assay displayed that compounds 5c and 5d potentially inhibit CHIKV infection. Further, qRT-PCR assay
results clearly show the potential of these two compounds in the suppression
of viral RNA levels in infected cells. Furthermore, the antiviral
activity of dihydrorugosaflavonoids toward CHIKV is also well delivered
by IFA.

Conclusions
Flavonoid compounds have received many
rewards
by showing their potential in medicinal chemistry. Dihydrorugosaflavonoids
belong to the same class and display their potential to inhibit CHIKV
replication. In conclusion, it could be explicated that halogenated
dihydrorugosaflavonoids with the appropriate modifications are deserving
candidates for additional study to find out the accurate facts of
their mechanism of action and effective anti-CHIKV therapeutics.

Antiviral Cell-Based Assays
Cells and Viruses
Vero cells (NCCS, Pune, India) were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM;
HiMedia, India) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Gibco), 100 units of penicillin, and 100 mg of streptomycin/mL
at 37 °C and in a 5% CO2 incubator. Using the virus
adsorption technique, CHIKV (accession number, KY057363.1; strain,
119067)50 stocks were prepared in Vero
cells and stored at −80 °C until needed. By using the
plaque-forming assay, the virus titer is calculated. Plaque-forming
unit per milliliter (PFU/mL) was used to quantify the virus titer.

Cytotoxicity Studies
The cytotoxicity of 5c and 5d compounds for Vero cells was measured using
MTT (Sigma) in a 96-well plate format. Stocks of 5c and 5d compounds were prepared by dissolving in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), and the working concentration was prepared by further diluting
in culture media. At 90% confluency, the media were removed, and media
containing different dilutions of compounds were added into each well.
Wells with 0.1% DMSO were considered as control. After 24 h, MTT was
added to each
96-well in a volume of 20 μL of 5 mg mL–1 stock
and
incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Upon completion
of incubation, DMSO was added to dissolve formazan crystals. The absorbance
was read at a wavelength of 570 nm using citation three
multi-mode plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). The experiment
was done in triplicates.

Assessment of Antiviral Activity
Vero cells were seeded
onto a 24-well plate at a cell density of 2 × 105 cells/well.
Cells were treated with compounds 12 h prior to infection (before
infection). At MOI of 1, the cell monolayer was infected with CHIKV
with gentle shaking after every 15 min for 90 min. The inoculum was
discarded, and the cell monolayer was washed twice to ensure that
there is no chance of secondary infection. Compounds were also added
in the post-infection media containing DMEM with 2% FBS for 24 h (after
infection). Infected cells were incubated with 0.1% DMSO as the negative
control. After 24 hpi, the supernatant was collected for determining
virus titer by plaque-forming assay. After collecting the supernatant,
TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added (as per manufacturer’s
protocol) to the adherent cells in a 24-well plate to isolate RNA
for qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the CPE of CHIKV on the Vero cell line appeared
in ∼48 h after the cell infection. Hence, the effect of inhibitory
compounds on the CPE was observed after 48 hpi with an inverted light
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Dose–response cell viability
and antiviral curves were used to determine EC50 and CC50. The ratio of CC50/EC50 is the selectivity
index, which gave an idea of the therapeutic window of the dihydrorugosaflavonoid
compounds.

Plaque Reduction Assay
To perform the plaque assay
for measuring the virus titer, a Vero cell monolayer was seeded in
24-well plates at 2 × 105 cells per well. 5c and 5d compound treatment and infection were the same
as described in the assessment of antiviral activity. The final DMSO
concentration in both the compounds was 0.01% v/v. The infected cells
were treated with varying concentrations of each compound in DMEM
with 2% FBS and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for
24 h. At 24 hpi, the cell supernatant was harvested, and the 10-fold
serial-diluted CHIKV supernatant was added to the Vero cells and incubated
at 37 °C for 90 min while the untreated but virus-infected cells
were taken as control. Afterward, cells were overlaid with 1% carboxymethyl
cellulose in MEM with 2% FBS and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 48 h, the overlay medium was discarded, then the cells
were fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 2 h, and cells were stained with
1% crystal violet solution for plaque visualization.

Dose–response
curves were generated by measuring percent inhibition in the plaque
reduction assay for a particular range of compound concentrations.
Varying concentrations of each compound were used to generate inhibition
curves for calculating the 50% effective concentration (EC50). EC50 of each compound was calculated by plotting the
graph of percent inhibition of the compound at different concentrations
vs. compound concentration. The plaque reduction assay was performed
in triplicates for a particular concentration of the compound and
was repeated twice to verify the constant inhibition results.

Quantitative Real-Time (qRT) PCR
Vero cells were seeded
onto 12-well plates at a cell density of 4 × 105 cells
per well.16,175c and 5d compounds’
treatment and infection were the same as described in the assessment
of antiviral activity. For quantification of viral genome after 24
h of incubation with or without the compound, the supernatant was
discarded and trizol was added to the plate. RNA was purified according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified RNA was treated with
DNAse to remove any traces of genomic DNA (Promega) and then subsequently
used for cDNA preparation using the AccuScript high fidelity cDNA
synthesis kit (Agilent) with 1 μg of extracted RNA. The forward
and reverse primers used for amplification51,52 are given in Table 4.

Negative and positive controls were included for PCR
amplification. Nuclease-free water was used instead of the RNA sample
as a negative control to screen possible contamination. RNA extracted
from the untreated CHIKV supernatant was used as a positive control.
Experiments were done in triplicate and repeated twice for accuracy
of the result. PCR runs were carried out according to the standard
KAPA SYBR fast universal qPCR kit on a QuantStudio 5 System (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The cycling conditions are as follows:
95 °C for 20 s and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 s and 60
°C for 20 s. Fluorescence was detected after each cycle. To analyze
data, fold change difference between control samples and compound-treated
samples was calculated using ΔΔCt values.

Immunofluorescence Assay
Vero cells were seeded onto
a 6-well plate at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells
per well. Cells were treated with 70 and 50 μM concentrations
of 5c and 5d compounds prior to and after
CHIKV
infection. At 36 hpi, cells were washed three times with PBS and then
fixed with methanol:acetone (1:1) for 1 h at room temperature followed
by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton-X-100. After washing, cells were
incubated with antibodies against CHIKV, i.e., anti-alphavirus (1:100,
SANTA Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), for 1 h and then incubated with fluorescein
(FITC)-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (1:250, Sigma) for
30 min at 37 °C. The plate was then rinsed with PBS and counter-stained
with DAPI (Sigma) for 15 min. Then, the image was captured by two
trained persons, under a fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems).
All experiments were repeated thrice to verify the results.
