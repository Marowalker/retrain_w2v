Feasibility of performing multiple
coulometric titrations in a single course of electrolysis is presented.
In these titrations, three pairs of cathode and anode compartments
were connected with a network of electrodes and salt bridges. Passage
of current through the cell caused concurrent electrolysis in cathode
and anode compartments. Electrogenerated reagents produced in these
compartments were used as titrants for quantifying the analyte samples.
Endpoints of the titrations were determined from the visual color
change of an indicator. The charge passing through the cell was monitored
and Faraday’s laws of electrolysis were applied to assess the
quantitative relation between the charge and analyte concentration.
Experimentally determined coulombs required to titrate aqueous potassium
hydrogen phthalate, MnO4–, OH–, and S2O32– were 0.100,
0.466, 0.103, and 0.0934 C, respectively. These results matched with
estimated values of 0.0965, 0.482, 0.0965, and 0.0965 C, respectively.
Agreement between the coulombs determined from experimental results
and reaction stoichiometry suggests a feasible application of concurrent
coulometric titrations. Efficacy of the method was tested for determining
the active ingredients in household vinegar and vitamin C dietary
supplement tablets. Quantities of acetic acid and ascorbic acid in
these products were 5.1% and 980 mg, respectively, agreeing with the
quantities determined from volumetric titrations (5.1% and 990 mg)
and manufacturer’s label (5.0% and 1000 mg).

Introduction
Coulometric Titrations
In coulometric titrations, a reagent is produced in an electrolytic
reaction at a cathode or an anode. In a secondary reaction, an electrolytically
produced reagent chemically reacts with the analyte sample and the
endpoint of the titration is determined by a suitable detection method.
Charge passing through the cell is monitored and Faraday’s
laws of electrolysis are applied to determine the amount of reagent
produced at an electrode. Coulometric titrations offer a number of
advantages over conventional titrations;1 in particular, they eliminate preparation and standardization of
reagents. A small amount of reagent can be produced without volumetric
quantification. Reagents that are unstable to use because of volatility
or reactivity can be employed as coulometric titrants and dilution
effects do not occur during the titration. Over several decades, numerous
reports presented coulometric titrations applied to a wide field of
applications.1−30 Reviews of coulometric titrations illustrate a broad scope of its
analytical applications.7,13,18 A variety of substances have been analyzed by coulometric titrations,
including porphyrins,24 mercury complexes,25 thiols,26 cations
and anions,2,27,29 complexes of nickel,21 biodiesels,12 and reference standards.5,6 Coulometric
Karl–Fischer analysis was applied to characterize microemulsions19 and porphyrin assemblies.9 Laboratory experiments of an academic interest present
coulometric analysis of common household products.10,11 Several innovative methods demonstrate coulometric devices for inexpensive,
rapid, and sensitive analysis. These methods include double-pulse
compensation,14 titration in a liquid drop,15 application of a paper-based device,16 and electrode modification with ion-selective
membranes.17,23 A study on electrocatalyzed water
oxidation combines coulometry with cyclic voltammetry and quartz crystal
microbalance.22 Salient features of coulometric
titrations continue to attract researchers from various areas of chemistry.
However, there are relatively few reports on the coulometric methods
leading to electrolytic production of reagents in multiple compartments
and enabling quantification of multiple analyte samples in a single
course of electrolysis.16,18

Feasibility of Concurrent
Coulometric Titrations
As current passes through the cell,
an electrolytically produced reagent (or titrant) chemically reacts
with the analyte sample added to one of the compartments. Three cascading
electrolysis cells producing three electrogenerated reagents enable
three independent titrations. Continuous monitoring of charge permits
the quantification of reagent produced in each compartment. In view
of this hypothesis, in this article, we test the feasibility of performing
concurrent coulometric titrations using a multicompartment cell. An
electrolysis of water (eq 1) produces the reagent OH–(aq) at the cathode.
Three electrolysis cells connected in series facilitate electrolytic
production of OH–(aq) ions, concurrently in three
compartments. Since the same current passes through the electrolysis
cells, the charge passing through the cells facilitates the quantification
of OH–(aq) ions produced in each cathode compartment.
In the secondary reaction, the electrogenerated reagent chemically
reacts with the analyte sample, the primary standard KHP (KC8H4O4H) (eq 2), and the endpoint of the titration is determined
using a suitable acid–base indicator.

Exploring Other Electrolytically
Produced Reagents for Titrations
Fe2+(aq) is produced
in the cathode compartment by electrolytic reduction of Fe3+(aq) (eq 3).1 Three electrolysis cells connected in series
facilitate electrolytic production of Fe2+(aq) ions, concurrently
in three compartments. In the secondary reaction, Fe2+(aq)
chemically reacts with MnO4–(aq) added
as an analyte (eq 4)
and the endpoint of the titration is determined using MnO4–(aq) as a self-indicator.

Electrolysis of
water in an anode compartment produces H+(aq) (eq 5). Similarly, oxidation
of I–(aq) produces I2(aq) (in form of
I3–(aq) in presence of excess iodide)
(eq 7). These reagents
chemically react with OH–(aq) and S2O32–(aq) (eqs 6 and 8), respectively. We test
the applicability of the cell for the quantification of OH–(aq) and S2O32–(aq), as the
analytes.

Analyte 4: S2O32–(aq) 7   8  Visual indicator: 1% aqueous starch

Results and Discussion
Cathodic charge passing through the cell linearly changed with
the concentrations of KHP (Figure 1) and MnO4–(aq) (Figure 2). Similarly, the
anodic charge linearly changed with the concentrations of OH–(aq) (Figure 3) and
S2O32–(aq) (Figure 4). These linear relations indicate
that the amount of charge responsible for producing reagents in concurrent
titrations quantitatively relates to analyte concentration. Blank
trials of titrations for each analyte indicated nearly 0 C of charge.
Blank trials ensured minimal contributions of interfering ions competing
with the titration reaction. Faraday’s laws of electrolysis
applied to eqs 1 and 2 account for 0.0965 C/μmol of KHP(aq). Slope
of the plot (0.100 C/μmol) agreed with this estimate (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Plot of the charge passing
through the cathodes versus the amount of KHP placed in the cathode
compartments.

Figure 2 Plot of the charge passing
through the cathodes versus the amount of MnO4–(aq) placed in the cathode compartments.

Figure 3 Plot of the charge passing through the anodes versus the amount of
OH–(aq) placed in the anode compartments.

Figure 4 Plot of the charge passing through the anodes
versus the amount of S2O32–(aq) placed in the anode compartments.

Mole relations (eqs 3 and 4) between MnO4–(aq), Fe2+(aq), and Fe3+(aq)
indicate that 5 F or 482 426.5 C charge is equivalent to 1
mol of MnO4–(aq) (or 0.482 C) charge
equivalent to 1 μmol of MnO4–(aq).
This value agreed with the slope of 0.466 C/μmol (Figure 2).

Equations 5 and 6 indicate that
the passage of 1 F (or 96 485.3 C) charge corresponds to 1
mol of OH–(aq). This value (0.0965 C/μmol)
estimated from eqs 5 and 6 agreed with the experimentally determined value
of 0.103 C/μmol (Figure 3). Similarly, the value estimated from eqs 7 and 8 (0.0965 C/μmol)
agreed with the experimentally determined slope of 0.0934 C/μmol
(Figure 4). Quantitative
results of the concurrent titrations of KHP(aq), MnO4–(aq), OH–(aq), and S2O32–(aq) are presented in Table 1.

Table 1 Estimated
and Experimentally Determined Charges for Concurrent Coulometric Titrations

charge per micromole of analyte (in C/μmol) from stoichiometry and Faraday’s laws of electrolysis	experimentally
determined charge per micromole of analyte (in C/μmol) from the slope	coefficient of variation (%) (n = 5)	
KHP(aq)	0.0965	0.100	3.6	
MnO4–(aq)	0.482	0.466	3.3	
OH–(aq)	0.0965	0.103	2.1	
S2O32–(aq)	0.0965	0.0934	1.5	
The linear relations between the charge and the amount
of reagent were consistent with the simultaneous titrations using
reagents from both compartments. Equations 1 and 9 indicate that
0.0965 C charge accounts for neutralizing 1 μmol of acetic acid.
The experimentally determined value of 0.0987 C/μmol of acetic
acid agreed with this estimate. Similarly, an estimate (from eqs 7 and 10) of 0.193 C/μmol of ascorbic acid agreed with the experimentally
determined value of 0.189 C/μmol.

Quantities of acetic
acid and ascorbic acid determined from simultaneous coulometric titrations
were 5.1% and 980 mg, respectively, in agreement with the quantities
determined from volumetric titrations (5.1% and 990 mg).

Conclusions
The coulometric titrations offer a number of advantages over conventional
titrations1 and the proposed concurrent
coulometric titrations offer added features (Supporting Information, Table S1). Easy to construct, unbreakable and
transparent poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) cell, disposable salt bridges,
and small reagent volumes (about 2 mL in each compartment) add to
the salient features of coulometric titrations.

Proposed concurrent
coulometric titration method offers flexibility of combining multiple
independent titrations. Three concentrations of an analyte can be
concurrently titrated in three cathode compartments (as presented
in Figures 1 and 2), or three anode compartments (as presented in Figures 3 and 4), or a combination of two different analytes simultaneously
titrated in respective compartments (Figure 5). The simultaneous titrations helped achieve
six titrations in a single-course electrolysis.

Figure 5 Plot of the charge passing
through the cathodes and the anodes versus the amounts of acetic acid
(blue circles) and ascorbic acid (orange circles) titrated simultaneously.
Microliters and milligrams of vinegar and finely powdered supplement
tablet, respectively, were added to the compartments to achieve desired
concentration.

Quantities of acetic
acid and ascorbic acid determined from simultaneous titrations (5.1%
and 980 mg, respectively) agreed with the quantities from manufacturer’s
label (5.0% and 1000 mg, respectively). Relatively small coefficients
of variation (mean value ≤3.6% for titrations presented in Figures 1–4 and ≤2.7% for titrations presented in Figure 5) validated the repeatability
of titrations. Deviations in titration results are presented in the
Supporting Information section (Tables S2 and S3). Monitoring concentrations of acetic acid and ascorbic
acid are important in view of diet intake.31,32 Simultaneous coulometric method presented in this study exemplifies
this monitoring.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
reagents were obtained from Fisher Scientific and used as received.
Platinum wire (0.5 mm diameter) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Multicompartment
electrolysis cell was made of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) based
on the procedure described previously.33 Three pairs of electrolysis cells were connected by platinum wires
and the platinum wires in the terminal cathode and anode compartments
were connected to the coulometer (Figure 6). Adjacent pairs of cathode and anode compartments
were connected with disposable salt bridges. Obbligato-Objectives
Faraday-MP potentiostat was connected to a computer via USB connection,
serving as a coulometer. The current passing through the cell for
the titrations ranged from 4 to 10 mA. Desired amounts of analyte
sample, electrolyte, and indicator were added to the relevant compartments.
The contents of the cell for each analyte are summarized in Table S4 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 6 Schematic diagram
of the electrolysis cell: C1 and A1 represent the cathode and the
anode compartments of the first cell, respectively. SB represents
a salt bridge. C2, A2, C3, and A3 represent the cathode and anode
compartments of the second and the third cell, respectively. Platinum
wires served as terminal cathode and anode (in C1 and A3 compartments,
respectively) and interconnecting electrodes between three cells.

The concentration of KHP was directly
determined from its mass. The concentrations of other analytes (MnO4–(aq), OH–(aq), and S2O32–(aq)) were individually determined
from volumetric titrations.

Concurrent Titrations Using Cathodically
Produced OH–(aq) as the Reagent
Desired
volumes of KHP(aq) were added to three cathode compartments as presented
in Table S4. As current was passed through
the cell, OH–(aq) ions produced in the cathode compartments
chemically reacted with the KHP(aq). Completion of this secondary
chemical reaction was monitored by visual color change of the indicator.
The cathodic charge passing through the cell was recorded as the titration
endpoint (colorless to pink) was reached in each cathode compartment.
The titrations were repeated for three successively higher concentrations
of KHP(aq). Thus, the titration of six concentrations of KHP (2.59–15.5
μmol) were performed in two courses of electrolysis. Average
coulombs for five independent sets of experiments are presented in Figure 1.

Concurrent
Titrations Using Cathodically Produced Fe2+(aq) as the
Reagent
Electrolytically produced Fe2+(aq) served
as a titrant in an independent set of titrations of MnO4–(aq). Analyte MnO4–(aq) serving as a self-indicator prompted the endpoint of the titration
(purple to colorless). Multicompartment titrations of MnO4–(aq) were performed in the similar way as the
titrations of KHP(aq). Figure 2 presents the response of the cathodic charge passing through
the cell to the concentration of MnO4–(aq) in 0.48–2.9 μmol range, determined from five independent
sets of experiments.

Concurrent Titrations Using Anodically Produced
H+(aq) and I2(aq) Reagents
During the
course of electrolysis, H+(aq) ions were concurrently produced
in the anode compartments (eq 5). Validity of the cell was tested for the titration of OH–(aq) ions with the electrolytically produced H+(aq) ions. NaOH(aq) as an analyte sample with increasing concentrations
was placed in three anode compartments with an indicator. Electrolytically
produced H+(aq) chemically reacted with OH–(aq) (eq 6). As stated
earlier, the charge passing through the cell was recorded as the titration
endpoint (yellow to red) was reached in each anode compartment. The
titrations were repeated for successively higher concentrations of
OH–(aq). Figure 3 presents the response of the anodic charge passing
through the cell to the concentration of OH–(aq)
in 9.7–58 μmol range, determined from five independent
sets of experiments.

Similar titrations were performed for the
quantification of S2O32–(aq)
using electrolytically produced I2(aq) reagent. Charge
was recorded as the titration endpoint (colorless to black) has been
reached. Figure 4 presents
the response of the anodic charge passing through the cell to the
concentration of S2O32–(aq)
in 10–62 μmol range, determined from five independent
sets of experiments.

Simultaneous Titrations Using Reagents Produced
in Both Compartments
In a course of electrolysis, reduction
in the cathode compartment and oxidation in the anode compartment
results in producing two reagents. These reagents were used as titrants
for simultaneous titrations of two different analyte samples. We tested
the feasibility of using both reagents to simultaneously titrate two
analyte samples. In this course of electrolysis, we quantified active
ingredients (acetic acid and vitamin C) from two household products.
Concurrently produced OH–(aq) and I2(aq)
in the respective compartments served as titrants for acetic acid
and ascorbic acid, respectively (Table 2). Desired moles of analyte samples were placed in
the alternate compartments. This was achieved by placing vinegar samples
in C1, C2, and C3 compartments and ascorbic acid samples in A1, A2,
and A3 compartments (Figure 6). Figure 5 presents the electrolysis charge required to produce the titrant
and reach the endpoint for each analyte sample. Five independent sets
of experiments are presented. Five data points for each acetic acid
concentration are nearly overlaid. Vertical and horizontal scatter
for the data points for ascorbic acid represent small variations in
the recorded charge and measured mass of analyte sample, respectively.
