Bioinspired
superhydrophobic substrates have been used in many
scientific and technological areas. These substrates can trap atmosphere-linked
air pockets at the solid–liquid interface, offering an opportunity
to address the oxygen-deficit problem in many reaction systems. Herein,
we addressed the oxygen-deficit problem in metal oxide electrochemical
deposition by using a triphase electrode possessing an air−liquid−solid
joint interface. Oxygen in the interface is directly available from
the air phase for sufficient OH– production via
oxygen cathodic reaction, thereby offering us a green approach to
fabricate two-dimensional mesoporous ZnO nanoarrays over a wide range
of current densities. Further, because metal oxides are deposited
at the triphase interface, sufficient O2, a natural electron
scavenger required in photocatalytic reaction to suppress the recombination
of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, can be directly supplied,
and we demonstrated their enhanced photocatalytic reaction kinetics
in water remediation. The present work highlights a powerful interface-engineering
strategy for fabricating metal oxides with unprecedented photocatalytic
ability.

1 Introduction
Inspired
from the natural nonwetting surfaces, artificial superhydrophobic
substrates have been fabricated and used in many scientific and technological
areas, including drug release,1 crystal
assembly,2 enzymatic reactions,3−7 and photocatalysis.8 Immersed in an aqueous
solution the superhydrophobic surface traps numerous air pockets at
the solid–liquid interface, linking atmospheric oxygen to the
electrode surface by which sufficient oxygen can be rapidly supplied
from the ambient atmosphere.9,10 This approach offers
an excellent opportunity for addressing the oxygen-deficit problem
in many reaction systems.11−13

We report here a green
approach for electrodeposition of ZnO, a
model oxide, by using a triphasic electrode system with an air–liquid–solid
(A–L–S) interface. Because of its excellent optical
and electrical properties two dimensional (2D) mesoporous ZnO has
received great attention in a wide variety of fields.14−16 Various methods have been reported, including electrodeposition,
ionic layer epitaxy, thermal plasma, and solvothermal.17−20 Of these approaches, electrodeposition is of considerable interest
because of its low cost and easy scale up. During electrodeposition,
OH– is first generated by reduction of an oxygen
source which, in turn, reacts with Zn2+ to form Zn(OH)2. ZnO is subsequently formed via dehydration between the OH
ligands.21 For the electrodeposition reaction
to efficiently proceed, it is necessary that a certain concentration
of toxic additives, such as NO3–, H2O2 or ClO4– be available
at the electrode/electrolyte interface (e.g. NO3– + H2O + 2e– → NO2– + 2OH–).22,23 While natural oxygen (O2) is an effective electron acceptor,
and can easily be reduced at the electrode surface to generate OH– (O2 + 2H2O + 4e– → 4OH–),24 the
extremely low solubility and slow mass transport rate of oxygen in
aqueous solutions has limited its practical application in metal oxide
deposition.25

In this work, we address
the O2 deficit problem in ZnO
electrodeposition by developing an A−L−S triphase electrochemical
reaction interface as illustrated in Figure 1a. Such a reaction system allows for the
rapid transport of O2 directly from the atmosphere to the
electrode surface, rather than through the liquid phase as common
with conventional diphase electrodeposition systems, where it is electrochemically
reduced to produce OH–. The A−L−S
triphase electrochemical reaction interface enables a locally high
interfacial pH value independent of the bulk phase condition. The
resulting OH– will react with Cl– and Zn2+ ions to produce Zn5(OH)8Cl2. Crystal growth is limited along the (001) direction
because of preferential adsorption of Cl– in the
surface, hence, 2D Zn5(OH)8Cl2 nanosheets
are formed.26 Consequently, 2D mesoporous
ZnO nanosheets can be obtained via a thermal phase transformation
approach as illustrated in Figure 1b.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic illustration of Zn5(OH)8Cl2 synthesis by electrodeposition using an A−L−S
triphase reaction interface. Oxygen is directly transported from the
ambient atmosphere to the electrode surface. OH– is in situ generated through the oxygen reduction reaction (O2 + 2H2O + 4e– → 4OH–), which enables a locally high interface pH. (b) Evolution

2 Results and Discussion
To fabricate the triphase
electrodeposition system, a microporous
carbon fiber substrate was first subjected to a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE) treatment (see Experimental Section for details). Figure 2a shows a typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) top view image
of the microporous electrode substrate and a nearly spherical water
droplet placed on the substrate with a water contact angle (CA) of
152° ± 2°, indicating a superhydrophobic surface. One
side of the substrate, where the electrodeposition reactions take
place, is then exposed to a brief oxygen plasma treatment to reduce
the interfacial resistance and enhance the electron transfer between
the substrate and the electrolyte. Partially immersed in an aqueous
electrolyte, an A−L−S triphase interface is formed because
of the air pockets trapped at the electrode/electrolyte interface.

image of the nanoporous electrically conducting carbon
fiber substrate used in this work; the inset is a photograph of a
spherical water droplet placed on the substrate with a water CA of
152 ± 2°, indicating a superhydrophobic surface. (b,d–f)
are FE-SEM images of the samples fabricated at current densities of
−2, −0.3, −7, −10 mA/cm2, respectively,
with insets showing magnified images. (c) XRD patterns of samples
deposited at current densities of −0.3 mA/cm2 (black
curve), −2 mA/cm2 (red curve), and −7 mA/cm2 (blue curve) using the triphase electrode.

Figure 2b is a typical
SEM image of the hexagonal structured Zn5(OH)8Cl2 2D nanoarrays electrodeposited at a current density
of −2 mA/cm2 using the triphase electrode; the nanosheets
are about 1.2 μm in diameter and 30–50 nm in thickness.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-prepared samples (red
curve of Figure 2c)
can be respectively indexed to (021), (202), and (205) of the standard
Zn5(OH)8Cl2 (JCPDS card no. 07-0155).
In marked contrast, no materials are obtained (date not shown here)
when the deposition is attempted using a traditional diphase electrode
(e.g. hydrophilic carbon fiber, fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate),
where oxygen at the reaction interface has to diffuse through the
liquid phase.

To help understand the formation process of hexagonal
Zn5(OH)8Cl2 nanosheet arrays, using
a triphase
electrode synthesis experiments were carried out at different current
densities ranging from −0.3 to −10 mA/cm2. At a relatively low current density, −0.3 mA/cm2, see Figure 2d and
the black curve of Figure 2c, only a small amount of hexagonal Zn5(OH)8Cl2 nanosheets were obtained, with most of the
material having no regular microstructure. At low current densities,
OH– is produced at low concentration, and hence,
Cl– plays a major role in determining the resultant
morphology.27 At higher current densities,
−0.5 to −7 mA/cm2, a higher local interfacial
pH value is obtained, leading to the formation of a higher density
of regular hexagonal Zn5(OH)8Cl2 nanosheets
(Figure 2e and blue
curve of Figure 2c).
When the current density was further increased beyond −8 mA/cm2 ZnO nanoparticles, rather than nanosheets, were obtained.
In this case the high interfacial pH value favors the direct reaction
between OH– and Zn2+ with the subsequent
formation of Zn(OH)2. ZnO nanoparticles are formed because
of dehydration between the OH ligands.28Figures 2f and S1 show that ZnO nanoparticles, approximately
70 nm in diameter, are obtained at a current density of −10
mA/cm2.

The hexagonal Zn5(OH)8Cl2 nanosheets
are converted to ZnO nanosheets by thermal transformation. Figure 3a shows the XRD patterns
of the nanosheets, thermally converted from Zn5(OH)8Cl2, deposited at a current density of −2
mA/cm2. All peaks can be respectively indexed to (100),
(002), (101), and (102) of the standard hexagonal ZnO structure (JCPDS
card no. 36-1451). Figure 3b shows a typical SEM image of the ZnO nanosheet arrays; the
hexagonal nanosheet microstructure is maintained with the thermal
treatment. Each of the nanosheets has a mesoporous structure, with
the pores homogeneously distributed across the sheet as seen in Figure 3c. According to the
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images at low (inset of Figure 3d) and high resolution
(Figure 3d), the nanopores
inside nanosheet lie in the range of 5–40 nm. The clear 0.28
nm fringe spacing corresponds to the d-spacing of
ZnO(101) planes suggesting good crystallinity of the as-prepared 2D
mesoporous nanosheets. These results confirm that the triphase electrode
enables successful synthesis of 2D mesoporous ZnO nanosheets using
a relatively benign (green) solution.

ZnO nanosheets. (b,c)
are, respectively, FE-SEM images of mesoporous nanosheets at low and
high magnifications. (d) High resolution TEM images of a mesoporous
ZnO nanosheet.

We subsequently investigated
the use of ZnO nanosheets synthesized
at the A–L–S triphase interface as photocatalysts for
organic pollutant remediation in water. Despite great efforts to optimize
photocatalytic activity of ZnO,29−34 the reaction interface architecture, a crucial factor to the performance
of photocatalysis has received few attentions.8 Here, we investigated the reaction interface architecture effect
on the photocatalytic reaction. Because the mesoporous 2D ZnO nanosheets
were deposited at the A–L–S triphase interface, O2, an efficient natural electron scavenger needed to suppress
recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs during
photocatalytic reaction can be directly supplied from the air phase
(Figure 4a), thereby
resulting in much enhanced reaction kinetics.8,35−37 To understand the unique interfacial effect, control
experiments were conducted where the air phase was replaced by nitrogen, Figure 4b, in which case
needed O2 could only be supplied from the liquid phase.
Rhodamine B (RhB) dye was chosen as a model pollutant to establish
a performance baseline. Figure S2 shows
the experimental setup for the photocatalytic degradation experiments
which were performed under ultraviolet (UV) light illumination (Figure S3, black curve).

Figure 4 Degradation of RhB under
UV light illumination. (a,b) are, respectively,
illustrations of photocatalytic reaction interface based on the A–L–S
triphase system and nitrogen–liquid–solid (N–L–S)
system. (c) Degradation of RhB by mesoporous ZnO nanosheets based
on the A–L–S triphase system (red curve) and N–L–S
triphase system (blue curve). (d) Photocatalytic kinetic of mesoporous
ZnO nanosheets based on the A–L–S triphase system (red
curve) and N–L–S triphase system (blue curve).

As shown in Figures 4c and S4, RhB
degradation at 120 min was
approximately 95% using the A–L–S triphase reaction
system, a value approximately 2.8 times higher than that obtained
using a N–L–S system. Under the condition of only light
irradiation without photocatalysts there is virtually no RhB degradation.
The kinetics of RhB degradation were investigated using the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
kinetics equation [ln(C/C0) = −kt] for a first-order reaction, based
on which the apparent rate constant (k) can be calculated. Figure 4d shows virtually
straight lines for these two photocatalytic reaction systems, with
correlation coefficients higher than 0.99. The k value
of A–L–S reaction was calculated to be 0.02366 min–1, a value approximately 7-fold higher than that of
the N–L–S system (0.00331 min–1).
These results indicate that the solid–liquid–air triphase
photocatalytic reaction interface is very advantageous for promoting
photodegradation kinetics. In the A–L–S photocatalytic
system, sufficient O2 at the interface can be supplied
directly from the air phase, which can efficiently remove photogenerated
electrons from the surface of the photocatalysts, thereby suppressing
the electron–hole pairs recombination and generating larger
amounts of oxidative reactive oxygen species such as O2•– and OH• for efficient
oxidation reaction.8,35,36

3 Conclusions
In summary, by development and
use of an A–L–S triphase
electrochemical reaction system we have addressed the long-standing
O2 deficit problem inherent to electrodeposition of metal
oxides. The triphase reaction system enables the rapid transport of
oxygen, a natural electron acceptor, from air phase to the reaction
interface for sufficient production OH– concentrations.
We have demonstrated the system with synthesis of 2D mesoporous ZnO
nanosheets, and applied these in application to photocatalytic degradation
of RhB, an organic pollutant. The triphase reaction system reported
here can be readily extended to electrodeposition of other metal oxides,
and thus represents a novel opportunity for obtaining high-performance
photocatalysts.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Zinc chloride (ZnCl2, ≥98%)
was purchased from Sigma (USA). Potassium chloride
(KCl, ≥99.8%), and ethanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). RhB was used as probe pollutant.
All chemicals were directly used without further purification. All
solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ·cm,
Hitech laboratory water purification system).

4.2 Preparation
of ZnO Nanostructures
A carbon fiber substrate filled with
carbon powder (∼20 nm)
was cleaned by sonication in water and ethanol (15 min each) and then
immersed in a PTFE suspension (2 wt %) for 10 min. It was removed
from the suspension, dried in air, and then annealed at 350 °C
for 30 min. At this point the carbon fiber substrate showed superhydrophobic
properties. The superhydrophobic carbon fiber substrates were then
cleaned by using a mixture of ethanol and water (for 3 min) in an
ultrasonic bath and dried in air. One side of the substrate was then
exposed to a short-term oxygen plasma (100 mW, 3 min) treatment. Mesoporous
ZnO nanosheets were prepared on the substrates by cathodic electrodeposition
from an aqueous solution composed of 50 mM ZnCl2 and 2.0
M KCl kept at room temperature for 3 min, followed by thermal decomposition
removing HCl(g) and H2O(g) at 400 °C. Electrodepositions
were carried out on a CHI 660E workstation (CHI Instruments Inc.,
Austin, USA) with a platinum wire as the counter electrode and a saturated
calomel electrode as a reference electrode.

4.3 Photocatalytic
Measurements
The photocatalytic
performance was evaluated by the photodegradation of RhB in water.
The photodegradation reactions were conducted in a quartz cell (1.0
cm × 1.0 cm × 4.5 cm) containing 2 mL of RhB (15 mg/L).
The portion of substrate covered by ZnO was immersed in RhB solution,
while another part of substrate (free of ZnO) was exposed to air.
2D mesoporous ZnO nanosheets obtained at −2 mA/cm2 were chosen as photocatalysts. The mass of the photocatalyst deposited
on the substrate was 0.5 mg. Before testing, an absorption step was
carried out in the dark to reach the absorption–desorption
equilibrium. The photocatalytic system was then illuminated with a
UV lamp. The absorption spectrum of the RhB solution was measured
every 15 min using the UV–vis spectrophotometer, with absorption
used to calculate the concentration of the remaining RhB. Photocatalytic
reactions were also conducted in a N–L–S system, with
the air phase of the triphase interface replaced with nitrogen.

4.4 Characterization
Morphologies were
observed by SEM (Hitachi S4700, Japan) and TEM (Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin,
America). XRD analysis was performed using an X-ray powder diffractometer
(X’Pert Pro MPD, Holland Panalytical). A CA goniometer (JC2000D6,
Powereach, Shanghai, China) was used to measure the water CA. Plasma
treatment was performed using a plasma cleaner (SAOT, 5D, China).
Photocatalytic degradation was measured by a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Evolution 220, Thermo, America).
