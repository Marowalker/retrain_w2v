Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited
neurodegenerative disease
caused by the expansion beyond a critical threshold of a polyglutamine
(polyQ) tract near the N-terminus of the huntingtin (htt) protein.
Expanded polyQ promotes the formation of a variety of oligomeric and
fibrillar aggregates of htt that accumulate into the hallmark proteinaceous
inclusion bodies associated with HD. htt is also highly associated
with numerous cellular and subcellular membranes that contain a variety
of lipids. As lipid homeostasis and metabolism abnormalities are observed
in HD patients, we investigated how varying both the sphingomyelin
(SM) and ganglioside (GM1) contents modifies the interactions between
htt and lipid membranes. SM composition is altered in HD, and GM1
has been shown to have protective effects in animal models of HD.
A combination of Langmuir trough monolayer techniques, vesicle permeability
and binding assays, and in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) were
used to directly monitor the interaction of a model, synthetic htt
peptide and a full-length htt-exon1 recombinant protein with model
membranes comprised of total brain lipid extract (TBLE) and varying
amounts of exogenously added SM or GM1. The addition of either SM
or GM1 decreased htt insertion into the lipid monolayers. However,
TBLE vesicles with an increased SM content were more susceptible to
htt-induced permeabilization, whereas GM1 had no effect on permeablization.
Pure TBLE bilayers and TBLE bilayers enriched with GM1 developed regions
of roughened, granular morphologies upon exposure to htt-exon1, but
plateau-like domains with a smoother appearance formed in bilayers
enriched with SM. Oligomeric aggregates were observed on all bilayer
systems regardless of induced morphology. Collectively, these observations
suggest that the lipid composition and its subsequent effects on membrane
material properties strongly influence htt binding and aggregation
on lipid membranes.

==== Body
Introduction
The expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ)
tract near the N-terminus
of the huntingtin (htt) protein is the primary cause of Huntington’s
disease (HD), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder.1 Expanded polyQ domains in htt are directly correlated with
a propensity to aggregate into a variety of proteinacious structures
ranging from small oligomers to fibrils.2−7 There is also a strong correlation of the age of onset and disease
severity with the length of the polyQ domain, with ∼35 repeat
glutamines being the critical threshold required for the disease.8−10 The exact mass of htt depends on the size of the polyQ domain, but
full-length htt is approximately 350 kDa and 3144 amino acids in size,
based on a polyQ domain of 23. The polyQ domain is contained within
the 1st exon of htt and begins at the 18th residue. htt undergoes
a variety of cleavages to produce a variety of N-terminal fragments
comparable with exon1,11,12 and numerous lines of evidence
support the notion that N-terminal fragments are directly involved
in HD pathogenesis.2,12−14

Several
functions have been attributed to the htt protein,15 and many of these functions are directly related
to interactions between htt and lipid membrane interfaces.16−20 htt localizes to specific subcellular surfaces21 and functions in the transport of lipid vesicles (endocytic,
synaptic, and lysosomal), especially along microtubules.17−20 htt is also essential for the normal development of several perinuclear
membrane organelles, including mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum
(ER).22,23 Furthermore, htt localizes with brain membrane
fractions24 and intimately interacts with
a variety of specific membrane lipid components,25−29 including anionic phosphatidylinositol phosphates,
consistent with an electrostatic-based mechanism for membrane association.26−29 With regard to htt-exon1, the first 17 amino acids of htt (Nt17) directly preceding the polyQ tract functions as a lipid-binding
domain. Nt17 lipid-binding is facilitated by the formation
of highly conserved amphipathic α-helix,21,30−32 and post-translational modifications of Nt17 can alter the affinity of htt for lipid membranes.33

Beyond these normal functions of htt, there is increasing
evidence
that lipid interactions may play a role in the toxic gain of functions
associated with the expansion of polyQ in htt, as membrane-related
changes (including mutant htt membrane association and induced disruption
as well as altered membrane composition) are observed in HD.27,29,34−36 Whereas mutant
htt is primarily associated with the formation of microscopic inclusion
bodies in the cytoplasm and nucleus,13 about
one-half of the endogenous htt partitions with the membranes after
subcellular fractionation of neuronlike clonal striatal cells.25 Furthermore, htt associates with a variety of
membranous organelles, including mitochondria, ER, tubulovesicles,
endosomes, lysosomes, and synaptic vesicles.37−39 Lipids are
even incorporated within htt aggregates observed in mouse models,
and the surface of htt inclusion bodies contain membranous structural
elements.24,40 A variety of amino-terminal mutant htt fragments
directly bind the lipid membranes, aggregate and alter the mechanical
properties of the membrane, and ultimately cause membrane leakage
in vitro.41−46 Perinuclear inclusions of htt have been linked to disruption of
the nuclear envelope in HD mouse models,36 and expanded polyQ can embed into ER, resulting in membrane distortion.47

Protein/lipid membrane interactions have
been shown to potentially
play a role in a number of amyloid-related diseases.43 Membrane composition may directly influence htt aggregation
and related toxicity. In this regard, there are a variety of lipid
homeostasis and metabolism abnormalities associated with HD. Specifically,
sphingomyelin (SM) fatty acid composition in cerebral white matter
is altered in both juvenile and adult onset HD with an increase in
short-chain fatty acids; this finding has been attributed to disturbed
myelination of nerves.48,49 Metabolic profiling of presymptomatic
HD in sheep found a marked decrease in plasma sphingolipids, which
may reflect a disease signature,50 whereas
an untargeted metabolomics approach in the STHdH cell line model of
HD identified altered sphingolipid metabolism.51 Furthermore, reduced glycosphingolipid concentration is
observed in erythrocytes, striatum, and caudate in both HD patients
and animal models.52,53 Glycosphingolipid species play
a number of roles in maintaining neuronal viability, and in particular,
GM1 has neuroprotective properties upon exposure to a variety of toxic
entities ranging from glutamate to amyloids.54,55 Reduced levels of gangliosides may be related to the observed reduced
synthesis of GM1 in fibroblasts from HD patients as well as in cell
and animal models of HD.56 The expression
of glycosyltransferases is altered in HD, resulting in disrupted glycolipid
and ganglioside metabolic pathways in the caudate.53 GM1 deficiencies have been observed in the YAC128, R6/1,
and R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD as well as in caudate samples
from human HD patients.53,56,57 Interestingly, the GM1 content in the plasma membrane of HD cells
correlated with a cell’s susceptibility to apoptosis.56 Collectively, these observations have led to
a number of studies exploring the use of GM1 as a potential therapeutic
agent. For example, addition of GM1 to the striatal cell line models
of HD resulted in a protective effect against htt toxicity, restoring
cell survival to wild-type levels.56 The
additional GM1 activates AKT (Ser/Thr-specific protein kinase), resulting
in enhanced phosphorylation of mutant htt,56 and phosphorylation is known to reduce mutant-htt accumulation and
induce toxicity.58−60 The intraventricular infusion of GM1 in a symptomatic
transgene HD mouse model induced phosphorylation of residues 13 and
16 within Nt17 and attenuated htt toxicity, restoring normal
motor function.61 Beyond simply adding
GM1, mitochondrial modulators, alpha-lipoic acid and acetyle-l-carnitine, were able to enhance glycosphingolipid levels in an experimental
HD cell model.62 Although the primary importance
of htt aggregation in HD has long been appreciated, the impact of
specific lipid components to modulating htt aggregation and its direct
interaction with membrane interfaces is poorly understood.

Here,
we characterize the interaction of N-terminal htt fragments
with total brain lipid extract (TBLE) lipid membranes that contain
varying exogenous amounts of sphingolipids, SM or GM1. The use of
a variety of membrane models [lipids monolayers at the air/buffer
interface, large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), and supported lipid
bilayers] and biophysical techniques [in situ atomic force microscopy
(AFM), Langmuir trough techniques, and vesicle association/permeability
assays] enabled us to test a range of SM and GM1 concentrations, which
can amplify any weak htt–sphingolipid interaction to determine
how varying the SM and GM1 concentrations affects the interactions
of htt with lipid membrane interfaces.

Results and Discussion
Addition
of SM or GM1 Modifies the Insertion of htt into Lipid
Membranes
To understand how the sphingolipids, SM and GM1,
with a common sphingosine backbone but varying headgroups (SM—phosphocholine;
GM1—complex oligosaccharide) alter the interactions between
htt and lipid membranes, monomeric htt peptide (Nt17-Q35-P10-KK) insertion into TBLE monolayers with varying
amounts of exogenously added SM or GM1 was measured using a Langmuir
trough (Figure 1).
Upon injection to the subphase, the peptide molecules partition between
the bulk and air/buffer interface because of the presence of the amphipathic
N-terminal lipid-binding domain, Nt17, until an equilibrium
spreading pressure is reached (Π = 17.3 mN/m at 900 nM peptide42). Pure TBLE monolayers and those doped with
10 or 20 wt % exogenous SM or 5 or 10 wt % GM1 were spread at the
air/buffer interface and compressed to a physiologically relevant
surface pressure of 30 mN/m.63,64 The amounts of exogenous
SM and GM1 to be added were determined from preliminary screening
experiments that suggested the SM-impacted htt/lipid interactions
up to an addition of 20%, whereas the impact of GM1 saturated after
the 10% increase. The exogenous amounts of SM and GM1 added to the
TBLE system are not physiological. Though TBLE with 10% GM1 or 30%
SM will not be found within a cell membrane, these limits were chosen
to provide a clear experimental system to determine how these lipid
components interacted with htt. The monolayers were held at this pressure
as freshly prepared monomeric peptide was injected into the subphase,
and the average area per molecule at the interface, an indication
of peptide insertion, was monitored until equilibrium was reached.
Then, the pressure was lowered 4 mN/m, and the process was repeated.
The addition of either SM or GM1 at any concentration decreased the
extent of htt peptide insertion into the monolayer at each surface
pressure (Figure 1).
These decreases were statistically significant (p < 0.05) compared to control using a t-test,
except for addition of GM1 at surface pressures greater than 26 mN/m
and addition of SM at a surface pressure of 26 mN/m. The reduced insertion
scales with the SM content; pure TBLE had a 28% total increase in
the area, whereas adding 10 wt % exogenous SM resulted in a 23% area
increase and 20 wt % SM had an 18% increase. However, the reduction
in insertion associated with increased GM1 concentration was similar
for both 5 and 10 wt % used here at ∼20% total increase in
the area. Of note, regardless of the amount of exogenous SM or GM1,
Nt17-Q35-P10-KK inserted into the
lipid monolayers at surface pressures higher than the previously measured
equilibrium spreading pressure, indicative of a driving force for
the peptide to interact with the TBLE membrane. This experiment measures
htt peptide association with and insertion into the lipid monolayer,
as determined by the headgroup chemistry and the lipid packing density
dictated by the phase state of the layer.

lipid monolayers of varying (A) TBLE/SM and (B) TBLE/GM1 ratios at
the air/buffer interface, expressed as % insertion at each surface
pressure. The error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3 separate experiments).

To ascertain how the addition of exogenous SM or GM1 affects
TBLE
membranes in decreasing the amount of htt peptide insertion, individual
surface pressure versus mean molecular area isotherms were measured
for the pure components and a series of binary mixtures of TBLE with
SM or GM1 (Figure 2A,B). As pure TBLE and SM had similar isotherms, an increase in the
SM content did not dramatically affect the TBLE monolayer isotherm.
In terms of lipid mixtures, the lipid raft hypothesis proposes that
naturally occurring lipids such as sphingolipids, glycosphingolipids,
and cholesterol specifically aggregate in the plane of the membrane
driven primarily by hydrogen bonding between the lipid headgroups
and alignment of saturated hydrocarbon chains.65 The SM brain extract used here is a heterogonous mixture
consisting of SM molecules with a sphingosine backbone bound to one
of a variety of amide-linked fatty acids, of which the prominent ones
are stearic (C18:0, 50%) and lignoceric (C24:1, 21%) acids. Adding
this mixture of SM lipids to TBLE has a complex effect. Because of
the hydrogen-bonding capabilities in the sphingosine backbone, neighboring
headgroups can be tightly bound and locally ordered.66 The SM molecules containing saturated hydrocarbon fatty
acid chains contribute to this close packing, but the lignoceric acid
has a cis-double bond in the chain that promotes disorder and fluidity,
resulting in a film with a packing density (on average) similar to
that of TBLE. The decreased amount of htt insertion, as measured by
an increase in the monolayer area at a constant surface pressure in Figure 1, that scales with
the SM content suggests that the solidifying effect of the increased
hydrogen-bonding network in the lipid headgroup region may prevent
the physical insertion of Nt17.

isotherms of (A) pure TBLE, pure SM, and
binary mixtures of TBLE and SM and (B) pure TBLE, pure GM1, and binary
mixtures of TBLE and GM1, measured at 30 °C. Average area per
molecule was calculated assuming an average TBLE molecular weight
of 850 g/mol.

By contrast, the TBLE/GM1
isotherms clearly demonstrate TBLE monolayer
condensation upon addition of GM1, relative to ideal mixing (Figure 2B) where the inclusion
of negatively charged bulky oligosaccharide headgroups did not appreciably
change the area per molecule at a specific pressure. Comparison of
the mean molecular area of the binary mixtures to that of a theoretical
mean area consistent with ideal mixing of the TBLE with GM1 suggests
that exogenous GM1 causes condensation or stiffening of the monolayer.
This is in agreement with both the lipid raft hypothesis, where ordered
regions of the membrane are enriched in gangliosides, and the GM1-induced
lateral condensation of lipids seen in binary DPPC/GM1 membranes.67 The GM1 condensation effect can be explained
by the electrostatic interactions between the headgroups, alignment
of dipole moments within their headgroups, and the tendency of gangliosides
to have cooperative interactions qualitatively attributed to hydrogen
bond formation between adjacent sugar residues.68,69 Our interpretation is that the small condensation effect seen at
low GM1 concentrations dramatically decreases the amount of htt peptide
insertion that leads to membrane lateral expansion.

SM and GM1
Alter the Susceptibility of Vesicles to htt-Induced
Permeability
Although lipid monolayers are a convenient model
for the outer leaflet of a cell membrane, it should be noted that
in addition to in-plane interactions between monolayer components,
cross-leaflet interactions between the lipids in bilayer membranes
also affect lipid packing, and these effects are not captured in a
monolayer model,70 prompting the need for
lipid bilayer assays to complement the measurements. As we have shown
previously, Nt17-Q35-P10-KK peptides
permeablize TBLE vesicles, allowing content leakage.42,45 To determine if altering the SM or GM1 content of TBLE bilayers
changed the membrane susceptibility to permeabilization by the htt
peptide, calcein dye leakage assays with LUVs were performed. Disruption
of the LUV membrane by external agents via mechanisms ranging from
short-lived pore formation to complete vesicle lysis results in calcein
release, dilution, and increased fluorescence emission from the unquenched
dye, allowing permeabilization to be correlated with the fluorescence
intensity. Solutions of predominately monomeric Nt17-Q35-P10-KK were mixed with vesicles comprised of
TBLE containing varying amounts of exogenously added SM or GM1, and
maximum fluorescence signal was measured (Figure 3). Measurements were taken after 3 min of
exposure to the peptide, as both our previous studies on related systems42,45 and our current work indicate that the peptide interacts with membranes
to induce the maximal amount of leakage, and hence the fluorescence,
within this timeframe. Nt17-Q35-P10-KK induced a significant calcein release from LUVs comprised of
pure TBLE, that is, approximately 30% increase in relative fluorescence
at the highest peptide concentrations compared to 0.7% arising from
control volumes of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) buffer (Figure 3). As the SM content of the LUVs was increased, the extent of calcein
dye leakage induced by exposure to Nt17-Q35-P10-KK drastically increased, with maximum leakage at the highest
SM levels (Figure 3A). Just 5% addition by mass of SM to TBLE LUVs significantly increased
permeabilization at all peptide concentrations, except at a peptide
concentration of 0.484 μM (based on t-tests, p ≤ 0.02), and the addition of 30 wt % SM approximately
doubled the permeabilization. All increases in calcein dye leakage
associated with SM content greater than 5% were statistically significant
(based on t-tests, p ≤ 0.02).
Increased susceptibility of SM containing LUVs to Nt17-Q35-P10-KK-induced permeabilization was unexpected
based on the decreased amount of peptide insertion into TBLE monolayers
enriched in SM, as measured on a Langmuir trough. This suggests that
SM increases the efficiency of lipid-bound htt to induce membrane
permeabilization, such that a lower concentration of membrane-inserted
htt resulted in greater content leakage. This may be attributed to
the disruption of the sphingosine H-bonding network, which could increase
leakage for comparable amounts of peptide insertion. By contrast,
decreased insertion of htt into membranes containing exogenous GM1,
as measured by Langmuir isotherms, did not correlate with a significant
change in membrane permeabilization of LUVs based on t-tests (Figure 3B).

of different (A) TBLE/SM ratios or (B) TBLE/GM1 ratios, exposed to
Nt17-Q35-P10-KK (or buffer acting
as a control) as a function of the peptide concentration. The error
bars indicate one standard deviation (n = 3 separate
experiments).

Enriching TBLE with SM
or GM1 Alters the Extent of htt-Exon1
Binding to Lipid Vesicles, as Determined by a TBLE/PDA Binding Assay
To verify that enhancing the lipid content of TBLE with SM or GM1
would modulate the interaction of a larger fragment of htt, full-length
htt-exon1, with lipids, we performed a TBLE/PDA vesicle lipid-binding
assay (Figure 4). This
assay uses mixed vesicles comprised of phospholipids and polymerized
PDA, which appear blue because of absorbance λmax ≈ 640 nm. Upon interaction with an exogenous particle or
macromolecule, the PDA side-chain groups in the vesicle can become
disordered, leading to an irreversible distortion of the side chains
that strains the polymer backbone. This disruption leads to a change
in the effective conjugated length of the PDA bonds, resulting in
a rapid, visible color change to red.71,72 The colorimetric
response can be used to quantify peptide/membrane interactions and
interfacial membrane processes such as protein aggregation that would
cause structural perturbations of the lipid interface. PDA-based vesicles
have been used to study a variety of protein/lipid interactions, including
those involving amyloid proteins.73−75 The TBLE/PDA vesicles
were systematically prepared with different ratios of lipid components.
These included pure TBLE, TBLE enriched with 10, 20, or 30% SM by
mass, and TBLE enriched with 5, 10, or 15% GM1 by mass. These different
vesicle preparations were exposed to freshly prepared htt-exon1(51Q)
at a concentration of 20 μM, and % CR was measured for 16 h
(Figure 4). Typically,
an initial steady increase in % CR is observed upon exposure of TBLE/PDA
vesicles to htt-exon1(51Q), and the % CR eventually reaches a quasi-steady
state. As the exogenous SM content was enriched from 0 to 10%, the
interaction of htt-exon1(51Q) with the vesicles was significantly
reduced (p ≤ 0.02 at each time point, based
on a t-test). However, an increase in the SM content
resulted in enhanced htt/lipid interaction (p ≤
0.02 at each time point based on a t-test). The interactions
between htt and vesicles enriched with 20 or 30% SM were indistinguishable.
The enhanced % CR associated with the addition of SM at 20% or higher
is consistent with the increased leakage measured by the calcein dye
assay, suggesting that the PDA assay detects an induced change in
the membrane associated with disruption. In comparison with the calcein
dye leakage assay, the reduced % CR associated with the addition of
10% SM suggests that SM enhances the susceptibility of membranes to
htt-induced damage. Though less htt peptide is physically inserted,
leading to reduced lateral expansion in the SM-doped TBLE membrane,
the associated htt disrupts and permeabilizes the membrane more effectively.
A small 5% increase in GM1 to the vesicles modestly decreased the
htt/lipid interaction at early time points. Increasing the GM1 content
by 10 or 15% dramatically inhibited the interaction of htt-exon1(51Q)
with the lipid vesicles (p ≤ 0.02 at each
time point based on a t-test), which was consistent
with the previous measurements of decreased peptide insertion into
the lipid monolayer.

error bars indicate 1 standard deviation (n = 3).

SM and GM1 Modulate the
Morphological Changes in Lipid Bilayers
Associated with Exposure to htt
We investigated the influence
of SM or GM1 on the aggregation of htt on lipid membranes using in-solution
AFM. Supported lipid bilayers on mica were systematically produced
with varying lipid contents. These lipid bilayers included pure TBLE,
TBLE + 10 wt % SM, TBLE + 20 wt % SM, TBLE + 5 wt % GM1, and TBLE
+ 10 wt % GM1. Such supported lipid bilayers are known to retain several
important properties associated with lipid membranes, such as lateral
fluidity,76 and similar systems have been
used as model surfaces to study protein aggregation with lipid membranes.33,41−43,45,77−82 Pure TBLE bilayers and those with exogenously added SM or GM1 were
all smooth in appearance [root mean square (rms) roughness less than
0.2 nm], with no indication of distinct micron-scale lipid domains
or phase separation prior to exposure to htt-exon1(51Q) (Figure 5A), and were stable
with no induced morphological changes for at least 8 h under continuous
AFM imaging. Having established that supported bilayers appropriate
for this study could be made from the different lipid mixtures, these
model bilayers were systematically exposed to freshly prepared aliquots
of htt-exon1(51Q) at a final protein concentration of 20 μM
in the AFM fluid cell and continuously imaged using AFM in-solution,
allowing for the direct tracking of protein aggregation on the bilayer.
Only continuous TBLE bilayers (40 × 40 μm in size), as
assessed by AFM imaging, were exposed to htt-exon1(51Q), and observations
were limited to these verified regions of the continuous bilayer.

lipid bilayers of TBLE, TBLE + 10% SM, TBLE + 20% SM, TBLE + 5% GM1,
and TBLE + 10% GM1 prior to exposure to any htt-exon1(51Q). (B) Sequential

surface in the sequential images. (C) Zoomed-in AFM images demonstrating

Height and volume histograms of oligomeric aggregates observed on
TBLE bilayers presented as a function of time. To ease visualization,
the histograms were normalized for each time point by setting the
value of the most common height or volume to 1.

Consistent with our previous studies,45 pure TBLE bilayers exposed to 20 μM solutions of
htt-exon1(51Q)
quickly (within 1 h) develop regions characterized by extensive roughness
(rms roughness greater than 1.0 nm) and appearance of discrete, oligomeric
htt aggregates (Figure 5B). These regions of increased roughness expand in area and become
increasingly rougher with time (observed for up to 5 h). Previous
reports have correlated these morphological changes with altered mechanical
properties of the lipid bilayer and membrane leakage.42,45,46 Although the number of oligomers
observed on the surface increased with time, these oligomers appeared
to be stable (Figure 5C,D). That is, specific individual oligomers could be identified
in subsequent images without large changes in their size. As a population,
the average size of oligomers did not change with time (a mode of
4–5 nm in height and ∼22 000 nm3 in
volume that was uncorrected for the size of the AFM probe) (Figure 5D). Collectively,
these observations suggest that the TBLE bilayer promotes and stabilizes
these specific oligomeric species. htt fibrils were not observed on
lipid bilayers during the time course of the experiment. The same
htt-exon1(51Q) construct has been shown to readily form fibrils over
the same time course under the same preparation conditions and concentration
in the absence of lipids.83 The lack of
fibril formation on the pure TBLE bilayer suggests that the lipid
system either promotes the formation of aggregates off the pathway
to fibrils or that aggregate intermediate oligomers are stabilized
by interaction with the membrane.

When TBLE bilayers were enriched
with 10 or 20% SM, the morphological
changes associated with exposure to htt-exon1(51Q) were altered (Figure 6A,B). When TBLE was
enriched with 10% SM, the regions of the bilayer altered were smaller
in area and had a smoother, plateau-like appearance. These regions
increased in height with time. These regions were also not associated
with the abundant formation of oligomeric aggregates. With the addition
of 20% SM to TBLE bilayers, regions of increased roughness that were
associated with the appearance of small oligomers initially developed;
however, the morphology of these regions evolved with time to eventually
form plateau-like domains that extended 10–16 nm above the
surface, corresponding to the height of several lipid bilayers. These
plateau-like domains are clearly distinguishable in phase-contrast
AFM imaging, suggesting that they are mechanically different than
the unaffected regions of the bilayer (Figure 6C). Fewer htt oligomers were observed on
bilayers that contained 20% exogenous SM compared with pure TBLE.
Oligomers observed on bilayers with the 20% extra SM were initially
slightly smaller (a mode of 2–3 nm in height and ∼20 000
nm3 in uncorrected volume) than the stable oligomers associated
with aggregation of htt on pure TBLE bilayers (Figure 6D). After 2 h, the oligomers observed on
lipid bilayers with 20% SM increased in size, but were still slightly
smaller than those observed on pure TBLE.

(D) Height and volume histograms of oligomeric aggregates observed
on TBLE bilayers enriched with 20% SM, presented as a function of
time. To ease visualization, the histograms were normalized for each
time point by setting the value of the most common height or volume
to 1.

When TBLE bilayers were enriched
with 5 or 10% GM1, the resulting
morphological change associated with exposure to htt-exon1(51Q) was
similar to that observed on pure TBLE bilayers; however, the area
of the bilayer altered decreased with increasing GM1 content (Figure 7A,B) parallel to
the lipid monolayer insertion and TBLE/PDA binding assays, which indicated
decreased htt insertion/association at a higher GM1 concentration.
Patches of increased bilayer roughness that were highly associated
with the appearance of htt oligomers developed, but these areas developed
more slowly with increasing GM1 content. The number of oligomers increased
with time on bilayers with both 5 or 10% enrichment with GM1, and
these oligomers were morphologically indistinguishable from those
observed in pure TBLE bilayers (a mode of 4–5 nm in height
and ∼22 000 nm3 in uncorrected volume; Figure 7B,C). The oligomers
were also stable as individual oligomers could be observed in subsequent
images for several hours, and their dimensions did not appreciably
change. After 5 h of exposure to htt-exon1(51Q), some fibrils could
be observed in one trial with TBLE + 5% GM1 (Figure 7A).

To quantify the interaction
of htt-exon1(51Q) with the supported
bilayers containing various amounts of SM or GM1 as observed by AFM,
the percentage of the surface that displayed any altered morphology
and the rms roughness of those regions were determined as a function
of time via image analysis (Figure 8). Despite the differences in the developed morphology
associated with exposure to htt-exon1(51Q), with the addition of 10%
SM, the percent area of the total bilayer altered was smaller compared
with that observed with pure TBLE bilayers; but the addition of 20%
SM resulted in an increased area of the bilayer with an altered morphology.
This relative area of altered morphology observed by AFM was consistent
with our PDA assay, which measures interfacial disruption induced
by htt-exon1(51Q). With the addition of GM1, there was no significant
change in the area of the bilayer surface displaying altered morphology
until enrichment with 10% GM1, when the modified surface area was
lessened, and there was no significant change in the rms roughness
of these regions compared with the pure TBLE controls.

Role of htt/Lipid Interactions in HD Pathogenesis
The
interaction of htt with membranous surfaces may mediate pathogenesis
in several ways. These include the direct promotion or stabilization
of specific aggregate species,42 compromised
mechanical integrity of cellular and subcelluar membranes,36,41,44,46,47 and altered trafficking of htt within the
cell.21 Several lines of evidence point
to a prominent toxic role for oligomeric species,84−86 and lipids
may promote the formation and stability of specific oligomeric species.
Such a scenario is consistent with our direct observation of stable
oligomers that formed on the various bilayers studied here and previous
reports indicating that synthetic polyQ peptides aggregate differently
on bilayer surfaces compared with mica substrates.42 If specific htt conformations or aggregates play a pivotal
role in HD, understanding how specific lipid components may shift
the relative abundance of disease relevant conformations may be critical.
Although enriching TBLE bilayers with GM1 reduced the total insertion
of the peptide into lipid monolayers and the accumulation of htt on
lipid bilayers, it did not result in a significant reduction of membrane
permeabilization in our study, suggesting that reduced susceptibility
of membranes to htt-induced disruption may not contribute to the protective
effect associated with GM1 replacement in HD models. As GM1 modulates
the action of numerous cellular receptors, GM1 deficits associated
with HD interrupt the processes associated with these receptors that
can be rescued by restoring GM1 levels. In addition, GM1 treatments
were found to enhance htt phosphorylation in mice, which is known
to reduce htt-related toxicity.56,61

Previously, we reported that
enriching TBLE bilayers with cholesterol resulted in large plateau-like
domains upon exposure to htt-exon1(51Q) of the bilayer, similar to
those seen in SM-doped membranes; however, these cholesterol-enriched
membranes were resistant to htt-induced permeabilization in contrast
to SM-enriched ones.45 One key difference
between these two systems is that the plateau-like regions that developed
in the bilayers enriched with SM grew to be thicker and mechanically
different (based on phase imaging) compared to the unaffected regions
of the bilayer. In the case of membranes enriched with cholesterol,
oligomeric aggregates of htt were not observed to form on the membrane
surface at any time to an appreciable extent.45 With this in mind, it is interesting to note that enrichment with
SM (of at least 20%) and GM1 here resulted in htt-induced membrane
permeabilization (Figure 3) to a similar or greater extent compared with pure TBLE bilayers
and that oligomers (although sometimes transient) were observed under
all of these conditions (Figures 5–7). Collectively, these
observations suggest that the formation of oligomers may play a key
role in the ability of htt to induce membrane permeabilization. These
findings also justify the need for the analysis of how the altered
membrane composition affects the htt peptide structure upon binding.

Conclusions
Lipid interactions are associated with a number
of wild-type functions
attributed to htt. Membrane damage and altered lipid homeostasis are
the biochemical features of HD, and this htt-induced damage to membranes
represents a potential toxic mechanism in HD, as a similar membrane
disruption has been associated with a number of other amyloid-forming
proteins. As a result, determining the factors that regulate the affinity
of htt for membranes is critical not only for understanding the normal
functions of htt but also for identifying ways to modify htt–lipid
interactions for potential therapeutic strategies. In this study,
we investigated the role of sphingolipids, SM and GM1, in modulating
the interaction with and subsequent aggregation of model htt peptides
(both synthetic and recombinant) on TBLE lipid membranes and the associated
consequences. The exogenous addition of SM or GM1 to TBLE lipid monolayers
reduced the insertion of htt, likely due to the increased extent of
the sphingosine backbone hydrogen-bonding network within the membrane.
The extent of htt-induced vesicle permeabilization was not affected
by the addition of GM1, whereas increasing the SM content enhanced
the susceptibility of vesicles to htt-induced permeability; though
less htt was inserted into the membranes containing a higher concentration
of sphingolipid, the disruption induced by htt caused more content
leakage. In agreement with the lipid monolayer insertion experiments,
the total interaction of htt with bilayers enriched with GM1 was reduced,
as measured by both a colorimetric assay and AFM. Although the extent
of bilayer alteration caused by exposure to htt was reduced with increasing
GM1 content, the actual morphological features associated with the
affected regions of the bilayer, including oligomer formation, were
consistent with those observed on pure TBLE. The extent of htt/lipid
interaction varied greatly with the SM content, and the induced morphological
changes of the bilayer were distinct in comparison with those observed
on pure TBLE bilayers. These observations suggest that sphingolipid
composition strongly influences the material properties of the lipid
membrane, which affects htt binding and aggregation, and that subsequent
oligomer formation on the interface may correlate with membrane permeabilization.

Methods
Peptide
Preparation
A synthetic, model htt peptide
consisting of the Nt17 domain, 35 glutamines (sufficient
for aggregation),87 a polyproline (polyP)
domain 10 residues in length, and 2 C-terminal lysines, referred to
as Nt17-Q35-P10-KK, was obtained
via custom synthesis (Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, New
Haven, Connecticut). Lysines were added to enhance solubility. Established
protocols for disaggregation and solubilization of the peptide were
used.88 In short, the peptide was dissolved
overnight in a 1:1 mixture of TFA (Acros Organics) and hexafluoroisopropanol
(Acros Organics) at 0.5 mg/mL. A stream of N2 was used
to evaporate the solvent, and the residual solvent was removed using
a Vacufuge concentrator for 3 h (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY). The resulting
peptide films, stored at −20 °C, were then dissolved in
ultrapure water adjusted to pH 3 with TFA at a concentration of 200
μM. This solution was subsequently diluted in PBS (10 mM phosphate,
140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl) (Life Technologies) to a final concentration
of 20 μM and a final pH of 7.3.

Purification of Glutathione
S-transferase (GST)–htt-Exon1
Fusion Proteins
GST–htt-exon1 fusion proteins containing
51 repeat glutamines were purified, as previously described.89 Briefly, the GST–htt fusion proteins
were expressed by induction in Escherichia coli with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at 30 °C
for 4 h, and the cells were lysed with lysozyme (0.5 mg/mL). Fusion
proteins were purified from the lysate with a GST affinity column
via liquid chromatography (LPLC, BioRad). Relevant fractions were
identified by ultraviolet absorption and confirmed by gel electrophoresis.
Before use in any assay, the solutions of fusion proteins were centrifuged
at 20 000g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove
preexisting aggregates. GST was cleaved by Factor Xa (Promega, Madison,
WI), and this cleavage initiates aggregation. Experiments were carried
out in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl). To ensure efficient
GST cleavage, the GST–htt-exon1 fusion protein and the respective
cleavage agents were incubated for 1 h on ice prior to their addition
to any assay.

Langmuir Trough Configuration
All
lipid monolayer surface
pressure versus molecular area isotherms and peptide insertion experiments
were performed in a Teflon Langmuir trough with symmetric barriers
(large inverted microscopy model, NIMA Technologies, Coventry, England).
A stationary Wilmhelmy balance (NIMA Technologies, Coventry, England)
was used to measure the surface pressure at the air/buffer interface.
All measurements were collected at 30 ± 0.5 °C, and the
trough temperature was maintained with a circulating heated water
bath (Isotemp 3016D water circulator, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Lateral Compression Experiments
Lipid monolayer isotherms
were conducted to characterize monolayer phase behavior as a function
of lipid-packing density and membrane composition. Stock TBLE (Avanti
Polar Lipids) (extract lipid headgroup composition: 9.6 wt % phosphatidylcholine,
16.7 wt % phosphatidylethanolamine, 1.6 wt % phosphatidylinositol,
10.6 wt % phosphatidylserine, 2.8 wt % phosphatidic acid, and 58.7
wt % unknown) was obtained in chloroform and used without further
purification. Because of the uncharacterized composition of TBLE,
an average TBLE molecular weight of 850 g/mol was assumed. SM (brain,
porcine; Avanti Polar Lipids) was received in powder form and was
dissolved in chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich). In the SM brain extract,
the amide-linked fatty acid bound to the sphingosine backbone varies
with the following composition: C16:0 2%, C18:0 50%, C20:0 5%, C22:0
7%, C24:0 5%, C24:1 21%, and others 10%. GM1 ganglioside (brain, ovine,
sodium salt; Avanti Polar Lipids) was received in powdered form and
dissolved in 8:2 chloroform/methanol. TBLE was mixed in different
ratios with SM or GM1 to a total spreading concentration of 0.4 mg/mL
and stored in glass vials at −20 °C. The lipid monolayer
was formed by dropwise addition of the spreading solution on the PBS
(pH = 7.3) surface; the solvent was allowed to evaporate for 15 min.
Barriers compressed the monolayer at 6 cm2/min, and isotherm
measurements in the form of surface pressure (mN/m) versus mean area
per lipid molecule (Å2/molecule) were taken at 1 s
intervals until monolayer collapse.

Measuring Peptide Insertion
into a Lipid Monolayer
Insertion experiments were performed
to quantify the Nt17-Q35-P10-KK peptide
insertion into pure TBLE
and mixed TBLE/SM and TBLE/GM1 monolayers. The lipid monolayer was
compressed to a surface pressure of 30 mN/m to match the lateral density
of a cellular bilayer,63,64 and then, the barriers were switched
to feedback mode to maintain a constant surface pressure by adjusting
the monolayer surface area. Lyophilized peptide was rehydrated in
TFA/PBS, as described above, and immediately injected beneath the
compressed monolayer to obtain a 900 nM final peptide concentration
in the subphase. After 10 min, if no increase in the average area
per molecule to signify peptide insertion was observed, the maintained
surface pressure was reduced 4 mN/m and the process was repeated down
to a minimum of 14 mN/m. Percent insertion of the peptide at each
surface pressure was determined as a % increase in the area [(Afinal – Ainit)/Ainit × 100].

Vesicle Preparation
for Leakage Assay
LUVs of TBLE,
TBLE/SM, and TBLE/GM1 were prepared to determine internal content
leakage caused by htt peptide insertion. Lipid films, evaporated from
stock solution with a stream of N2, were hydrated in 70
mM calcein (Sigma) in 10 mM Tris, pH = 7.3 via 5 min of vortexing
and 5 min of sonication. The vesicles were treated with 7 freeze–thaw
cycles in ethanol/dry ice and warm water baths and then extruded 11
times through a 100 nm-pore polycarbonate filter (Avanti). The excess
dye was removed with size exclusion chromatography using Sephadex
G-50 beads (Sigma-Aldrich). Vesicle diameter size uniformity (120–160
nm depending on vesicle composition) was confirmed with dynamic light
scattering [Zetasizer ZS90 (Malvern Worcestershire, UK)]. Lipid concentration
was determined by a phosphorus assay adapted from Anderson and Rouser.90,91 Briefly, a lipid fraction (500 μL) and 8.9 N H2SO4 (225 μL) were vortexed and heated at 210 °C
for 20 min. After cooling, 6% H2O2 (75 μL)
was added and heated for an additional 25 min at 210 °C until
the solution was colorless. After cooling, 1.95 mL of ultrapure water,
5% molybdic acid (225 μL), and 10% ascorbic acid (225 μL)
were added, and the solution was placed in a boiling water bath for
10 min. Absorbance at 820 nm was measured using a Jasco V-550 UV/visible
spectrophotometer (Jasco, Easton, MD) and compared to a KH2PO4 reference plot to calculate the final lipid concentration.

Vesicle Leakage Assay
TBLE LUVs with exogenous SM (0–30
wt %) or GM1 (0–15 wt %) were exposed to the Nt17-Q35-P10-KK peptide in a concentration range,
resulting in peptide/lipid molar ratios ranging from 1:67 to 1:1.7
at 25 °C. Lyophilized peptides were hydrated as outlined above
and used promptly to minimize the presence of nonmonomeric species.
Fluorescence at 515 nm (495 nm excitation) from calcein was measured
prior to peptide exposure and 3 min after peptide administration using
a RF-1501 spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD). Vesicles were
then completely lysed using 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) to measure the
maximum calcein fluorescence. Vesicle leakage caused by the peptide
was calculated by 1  where If is the
fluorescent intensity after peptide addition, II is the initial fluorescence of the LUVs, and IT is the total fluorescence intensity after complete lysis.

TBLE/PDA Lipid-Binding Assay
TBLE/PDA assays were performed
using previously reported protocols.75,92 In summary,
diacetylene monomers 10,12-tricosadiynoic acid (GFS Chemicals, Columbus,
OH), TBLE, and an appropriate amount of either SM or GM1 were dissolved
in a solution of 1:1 chloroform/ethanol. Total lipid and PDA was always
mixed in a 2:3 molar ratio. The solution was evaporated off in a rotary
evaporator. The resulting films were resuspended in Tris-buffered
saline, heated to 70 °C, sonicated for 5 min at 100 W using a
sonic dismembrator (FisherSci), and stored at 4 °C overnight
to ensure self-assembly of the vesicles. Polymerization of the diacetylene
monomers was accomplished by irradiation at 254 nm with 7 lumens for
10 min (room temperature with stirring), which results in a blue color.
Polymerized TBLE/PDA vesicles were exposed to htt-exon1(51Q) at a
final concentration of 20 μM. TBLE/PDA vesicle samples were
also exposed to 1× buffer A (negative control) or NaOH (pH 12)
(positive control). All experiments were performed in triplicate in
a 96-well format, and the colorimetric response at 500 and 640 nm
was recorded for 16 h with an Infinite M1000 Pro plate reader (TECAN,
Switzerland) at 25 °C. A quantitative value representative of
the blue-to-red color transition was obtained by determining the %
CR, defined as75,92 2  where PB is the red/blue ratio of
absorbance
(A) defined as Ablue/(Ablue + Ared). Ablue is the absorbance at ∼640 nm (absorbance
at this wavelength range results in a blue color), Ared is the absorbance at ∼500 nm, PB0 is the red/blue ratio of the control sample (before induction of
color change), and PBI is the value obtained for the vesicle
solution after addition of peptides.

AFM Imaging Conditions
In-solution AFM experiments
were performed with a Nanoscope V MultiMode scanning probe microscope
(Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with a closed-loop “vertical
engage” J-scanner and a sealed tapping fluid cell. Images were
acquired with silicon cantilevers (VISTAprobes) with spring constants
of ∼0.1 N/m, scan rates of ∼2 Hz, and drive frequencies
ranging from ∼8 to 10 kHz. AFM images were processed and analyzed
using MATLAB and its image processing toolbox (Mathworks, Natick,
MA), as previously described.83

Preparation
of Supported Bilayers for AFM Experiments
TBLE, SM, and GM1
(Avanti Polar Lipids) were dissolved in chloroform
(Fisher Scientific) and mixed at appropriate ratios to have samples
of pure TBLE and TBLE spiked with specific weight percentages of exogenously
added SM or GM1. The chloroform was evaporated off using a Vacufuge
concentrator (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY). The resulting lipid films
were resuspended in buffer A (pH 7.3) at 0.5 mg/mL. To form vesicles,
these lipid suspensions underwent five sequential freeze–thaw
cycles, followed by 15 min of sonication in a bath sonicator. The
resulting vesicle solutions (35 μL) were injected into the AFM
fluid cell. The formation of a continuous bilayer on mica via vesicle
fusion was observed by continual AFM imaging, and all AFM experiments
were performed between 23 and 25 °C. The fluid cell was flushed
to remove vesicles remaining in solution. htt-exon1(51Q) was then
injected into the cell to a final concentration of 20 μM, and
the protein was present for the entirety of the experiment.
