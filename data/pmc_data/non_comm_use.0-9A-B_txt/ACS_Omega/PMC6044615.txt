A chemical printing
method based on gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-assisted
laser ablation has been developed. By rastering a thin layer of AuNPs
coated on a rat kidney tissue section with a UV laser, biomolecules
are extracted and immediately transferred/printed onto a supporting
glass substrate. The integrity of the printed sample is preserved,
as revealed by imaging mass spectrometric analysis. By studying the
mechanism of the extraction/printing process, transiently molten AuNPs
were found to be involved in the process, as supported by the color
and morphological changes of the AuNP thin film. The success of this
molecular printing method was based on the efficient laser–nanomaterial
interaction, that is, the strong photoabsorption, laser-induced heating,
and phase-transition properties of the AuNPs. It is anticipated that
the molecular printing method can be applied to perform site-specific
printing, which extracts and transfers biochemicals from different
regions of biological tissue sections to different types of supporting
materials for subsequent biochemical analysis with the preservation
of the original tissue samples.

Introduction
Extraction constitutes
a critical task for chemical analysis in
different aspects, such as food and water analysis, botanical analysis,
and pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.1−3 The analytes
embedded in samples are required to be isolated and concentrated for
chemical analysis. Conventional extraction methods, including solvent
extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, and solid-phase extraction,
are applied to different analytical purposes.4−6 Solvent extraction
is the most common approach but possesses several limitations. Specifically,
it involves a series of procedures (i.e., sample homogenization, dispersion,
and shaking) and also requires proper selection of the solvent that
can achieve a balance between extraction efficiency and matrix interference.7 More importantly, however, the spatial distribution
of the analyte molecules cannot be reconstructed after solvent extraction.
The delocalization of biomolecules results in the loss of critical
bioinformation, such as the histochemical distribution of biomarkers
and localization of drug metabolites in target organs.

Recently,
researchers have developed a solid-state extraction/printing
method for biological tissues based on picosecond infrared laser ablation.8−11 Biomolecules, such as peptides/proteins, were extracted upon irradiation
by picosecond infrared laser pulse. Water in the biological tissues
would absorb the infrared laser energy via the O–H bond vibrations.
This absorbed energy was then converted to thermal energy, which can
heat up the irradiated region instantaneously and facilitate molecular
extraction and transfer.12 The solid-state
extraction/printing process can retain the localization of analyte
molecules for subsequent analysis, which is particularly useful for
the biological tissue analysis and cannot be achieved by conventional
solvent extraction. However, the use of an infrared laser would require
the presence of water in the sample, which may not be generally practical
for dry or preserved samples. Furthermore, infrared lasers are less
available, unlike ultraviolet (UV) lasers, which are commonly found
in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometers. Therefore, it would
be advantageous to develop a laser-based solid-state extraction/printing
technique using a UV laser.

An in situ solid-state extraction/printing
method based on the
interaction of a UV laser with AuNPs was developed in the current
study. AuNPs with a strong UV absorption property can serve as an
efficient media for harvesting the laser energy and extracting the
biomolecules from a rat kidney tissue section. Using the solvent-free
argon–ion sputtering technique, AuNPs can be homogeneously
deposited on the tissue sample surface to form a thin-film layer.13 Strong photoabsorption of AuNPs arose from the
resonant oscillation of the surface electrons of the AuNPs, which
is known as surface plasmon resonance (SPR).14−19 After the absorption of laser photons via electronic interband and/or
intraband transitions,20−24 AuNPs can convert the photon energy to thermal energy. Laser-induced
heating, phase transition, or even explosion of the AuNPs would occur
if a significant amount of laser energy was deposited, which has been
suggested to promote the desorption process of the analyte molecules.22−24 The nanosecond time frame superheating and the transient molten
state of the noble metal nanoparticles upon laser irradiation could
possibly drive out the molecules from the interior of the sample and
promote an in situ solid-state extraction/printing process. Abundant
analyte molecules could then be extracted and transferred from the
tissue section to a smooth supporting substrate. The integrity of
the printed sample can be revealed by performing an imaging mass spectrometric
analysis. Here, various kidney metabolites have been detected in the
printed samples, with spatial distributions matched with those in
the original kidney tissue section. The results of this proof-of-principle
study demonstrated the feasibility of the solid-state sample extraction
method using the interaction of a UV laser with AuNPs for performing
the chemical printing of biological tissue sections.

Results and Discussion
Chemical
Printing by AuNP-Assisted Laser Ablation
A
AuNP-precoated kidney tissue section and two clean glass slides were
arranged in a sandwich-like setup (Figure 1). Upon laser irradiation from the back side,
the analytes were ejected from the front side of the tissue section
and transferred to the clean glass slide (i.e., supporting substrate)
to form the molecular transferred sample (i.e., printed sample). In
addition, the printed sample exhibited a pale pink color. To identify
the analyte molecules transferred in the printed sample, AuNP-assisted
laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry was performed. The abundant
analyte molecules were detected from the printed sample, although
they were not all identified in this proof-of-principle experiment.
The mass spectrum with an m/z range
of 20–500 is shown in Figure 2. An accurate mass analysis was performed to identify
the compounds detected from the printed sample. Four metabolite ions
were identified, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The metabolite ions at m/z 132.0335 and 146.0484 were identified
as [aspartic acid – H]− (28.8 ppm) and [glutamic
acid – H]− (21.2 ppm), respectively. Moreover,
deprotonated [hypoxanthine – H]− and [xanthine
– H]− were the metabolite ions detected at m/z 135.0305 (1.5 ppm) and 151.0261 (3.3
ppm), respectively. The identification of the detected biochemical
as compared with reference standards was further confirmed by tandem
mass spectrometric analysis as shown in Table S1.

b Tandem MS data are shown in Table
S1 of the Supporting Information.

To examine the integrity of the
printed sample, imaging mass spectrometric
analysis was conducted. Molecular ion images of the four identified
metabolite ions are shown in Figure 3. The metabolite ions of [aspartic acid – H]− (m/z 132.0) and
[glutamic acid – H]− (m/z 146.0) were evenly distributed on the entire kidney tissue
section. Deprotonated hypoxanthine (m/z 135.0) was mainly located at the medulla and pelvis regions of the
kidney section, whereas the metabolite ion of [xanthine – H]− (m/z 151.0) was
mainly located on the cortex region. Some other metabolites with clear
histological distributions, including those at m/z 92, m/z 134, m/z 258, m/z 457, and m/z 473, could also be
detected, as shown in Figure S1, although
they were not identified in this proof-of-principle experiment. In
general, histological distributions of the metabolite ions in the
printed sample resembled those of the tissue (Figure 4), which revealed that the delocalization
of biomolecules during the printing process was insignificant. It
is believed that a small laser ablation area and a close distance
between the tissue and the supporting substrate would prevent the
delocalization of biomolecules during the printing process, and thus
the integrity of the printed sample was well-preserved.

Figure 3 Spatial distributions
of four deprotonated metabolite ions in the
printed sample revealed by imaging mass spectrometry, including aspartic
acid, hypoxanthine, glutamic acid and xanthine.

Figure 4 Preservation of the histochemical information in the printed sample.
Spatial distributions of the nine selected metabolite ions at m/z 92, 132, 134, 135, 146, 151, 258, 457,
and 473 in the (a) printed sample were similar to those in the (b)
original rat kidney tissue section.

In addition, it was noted that the molecular printing could
not
be achieved without applying the AuNPs, as shown in Figure 5. In a control experiment,
only half of a kidney tissue section was coated with a thin layer
of AuNPs. After laser irradiation, a pale pink color was only observed
in the sample region coated with AuNPs, whereas the control region
without the AuNP coating remained colorless (Figure 5a). Furthermore, the printed sample was only
observed on the supporting substrate corresponding to the AuNP-coated
tissue section region (Figure 5b). In the subsequent imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) analysis
of the printed sample, selected molecular ions (including those at m/z 132, 135, 146, and 151) could only
be detected from the pink region of the printed sample, as shown in Figure 5c. The results revealed
that a thin layer of AuNPs were essential for the printing process.

Figure 5 Essential
role of AuNP coating in the molecular extraction/printing
demonstrated by a control experiment. (a) After laser irradiation,
only the lower half of the kidney tissue section, which was coated
with AuNPs, appeared pink, whereas no observable change was noted
for the upper half without the AuNP coating. Furthermore, printed
sample was only observed for the lower half of the tissue section,
as shown in (b). In addition, (c) metabolite ions were only detected
in the lower half (i.e., pink region) of the printed sample by using
imaging mass spectrometry.

This chemical printing method could also be applied to transfer
the biomolecules from biological tissues to other types of supporting
materials, such as nitrocellulose membrane and paper, as shown in Figure 6a–c, with
the preservation of the original tissue sample. The printed sample
on the nitrocellulose membrane and paper substrates could then be
analyzed using other biochemical approaches, though it remains to
be explored. Moreover, another distinctive advantage of the printing
method is its capability of site-specific printing for the selected
regions of the tissue section, as shown in Figure 6d, in which the cortex, medulla, and pelvis
regions of the kidney section could be separately printed on the different
supporting substrate. The printing method is similar to the technique
of laser capture microdissection25 for
the isolation of the targeted site from tissue samples.

membrane.

Proposed Mechanism of AuNP-Assisted
Chemical Printing
We anticipated that, upon laser irradiation,
AuNPs would undergo
laser-induced heating, followed by phase transition, such as melting,
as reported in our previous study22−24 and shown in a schematic
diagram (Figure S2), illustrating its effect
on the molecular extraction/printing process. Cell membranes would
be destroyed by the heat generated from AuNPs, and biomolecules embedded
in the tissue would be extracted and trapped by the transiently molten
AuNPs. In fact, the melting of AuNP thin films after laser irradiation
was evidenced from the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination
result, as shown in Figure 7. Prior to laser irradiation, a thin film of AuNPs was uniformly
coated on the tissue surface (Figure 7d). However, after laser irradiation, spherical nanoparticles
were generated (Figure 7e). The formation of spherical nanoparticles after laser irradiation
was also observed for the AuNP thin-film coating with different thicknesses
(Figure S3). The morphological change of
AuNP coating indicated that the phase transition occurred during the
molecular extraction/printing process upon laser irradiation. In addition,
spherical nanoparticles could also be observed on the surface of the
printed sample, as shown in Figure 7f, which revealed the role of AuNPs for carrying the
biomolecules to the supporting substrates during the molecular extraction/printing
process. Apart from the SEM result, the significant color change of
the AuNP coating on the tissue sample also implicated the morphological
change of the AuNP thin film during the extraction/printing process.
As shown in Figure 7a,b, the AuNP coating changed from slight blue-green (prior to laser
irradiation) to pale pink (after laser irradiation). It is well-reported
that the color change of AuNPs is related to the plasmonic resonance
property, which is highly dependent on the change of particle morphology
and size.19,26 As shown in the inset of Figure 7e, some smaller AuNPs were
formed on the laser-ablated tissue, and more smaller AuNPs were transferred
to the printed sample (inset of Figure 7f), which could account for the color change of the
tissue (from blue-green to pink) and support the transfer of materials
to the printed sample. Because the majority of the laser photoenergy
has already been modulated by the AuNPs, it is believed that the laser
would have minimal effect(s) to the integrity of the analyte molecules/biological
tissue.

Figure 7 Phase change (i.e., melting) of the AuNP thin film during the molecular
extraction/printing process, as supported by the optical color and
morphological changes before and after laser irradiation. The color
of the AuNP coating on the kidney tissue section changed from (a)
bluish green to (b) pink after molecular extraction. From the scanning
electron micrograph, (d) the AuNP coating was even and homogenous
before laser irradiation. However, after laser irradiation, spherical
AuNPs were (e) generated on the tissue section and (f) transferred
to the printed sample, which revealed a phase change of the AuNP thin
film and accounted for (c) the pink color of the printed sample. The
smaller AuNPs responsible for the pink color are shown in the insets
(red box) of (e,f).

Effect of Laser Fluence
on Chemical Printing
Previous
studies revealed that high laser fluence could induce high laser-induced
heating and subsequently cause a higher extent of phase transition.22−24 It is anticipated that the higher extent of laser-induced heating/phase
transition of AuNPs could result in higher molecular extraction efficiency,
and thus more biomolecules could be transferred to/printed on the
supporting substrate. Laser fluence between 67 and 126 mJ/cm2 (maximum fluence) using a constant thickness of AuNP thin-film coating
(5.0 nm) was adopted to investigate the effect of laser fluence on
molecular extraction/printing efficiency. Ion intensities of five
selected characteristic metabolite ions with small-to-medium mass
range, including the ions at m/z 92, 135, 258, 457, and 473 with clear histological distributions,
detected from the printed sample were plotted against the laser fluence,
as shown in Figure 8a. The results revealed that the ion intensities of selected ions
increased gradually with laser fluence from 67 to 111 mJ/cm2 and became steady when the laser fluence was beyond 111 mJ/cm2. The increasing trend of ion intensities might be because
of higher molecular extraction efficiency, as a consequence of higher
laser-induced heating and extent of phase transition. In addition,
different extraction efficiencies were observed among the five selected
metabolite ions, which could be because of their different binding
interaction with the transiently molten AuNPs during the extraction
process. A SEM examination was carried out, and the result was shown
in Figure S4. It was observed that the
amount of spherical nanoparticles formed on the printed sample was
found to increase with the applied laser fluence. The average number
of spherical nanoparticles increased from 42 ± 13 to 108 ±
17 when the laser fluence applied to the molecular extraction/printing
increased from 67 to 126 mJ/cm2 (Figure S4). The increase was statistically significant at the confidence
level of 90% (based on the Student’s t-test).
The increasing amount of spherical nanoparticles generated could be
attributed to the higher degree of superheating and the extent of
melting of AuNPs. Hence, more biomolecules could be extracted and
transferred to/printed on the supporting substrate with the assistance
of more newly formed spherical nanoparticles. Thus, an increasing
trend of molecular extraction/printing efficiency could be observed
with the increasing laser fluence (Figure 8a).

Figure 8 Effects of laser fluence and thickness of AuNP
coating on the molecular
extraction/printing efficiency. In general, the efficiency was found
to (a) increase with laser fluence and (b) decrease with AuNP coating
thickness, based on the measured intensities of five selected metabolite
ions.

Effect of Thickness of
AuNP Coating on Chemical Printing
As shown in Figure 8b, the ion intensities of the
five selected characteristic metabolite
ions (including m/z 92, 135, 258,
457, and 473) detected from the printed sample were plotted against
the thickness of AuNP thin-film coating (from 5.0 to 5.5 nm) using
a constant laser fluence of 111 mJ/cm2. An opposite trend
between the molecular extraction/printing efficiency and the thickness
of the thin film was observed, that is, the thinnest coating, 5.0
nm, resulted in the highest extraction efficiency and vice versa.
From the SEM examination results, the sizes of those spherical nanoparticles
formed after laser irradiation were found to increase with the thickness
of AuNP coating (Figure S5). As shown in Figure S5b,c, for the smallest film thickness
(i.e., 5.0 nm), the majority of AuNPs generated on the tissues after
laser irradiation was <200 nm in diameter and contributed to 70%
of the total particle coverage area. When the film thickness increased
to 5.3 nm, the size of the AuNPs increased in general and some of
them were 300–400 nm in diameter. When the film thickness increased
to 5.5 nm, some much larger AuNPs (>400 nm in diameter) appeared
and
dominated the total particle coverage area (>70%). The trend of
the
particle sizes was inversely correlated with molecular extraction
efficiencies, that is, the larger the laser-induced spherical nanoparticles
that were formed, the lower the ion intensities that were detected.
A possible reason for this could be the relatively larger proportion
of the extracted biomolecules that was embedded in the internal volume
of the newly generated spherical AuNPs, especially for larger spherical
AuNPs which have a smaller surface-to-volume ratio. Hence, in the
subsequent SALDI-MS analysis of the printed sample, larger spherical
AuNPs could not desorb most of the biomolecules embedded in the internal
volume, whereas smaller spherical AuNPs having a higher surface-to-volume
ratio could desorb the extracted biomolecules more readily.27 Overall, the results demonstrated that higher
laser fluence and thinner AuNP coating were more favorable for the
efficient extraction/printing process.

Conclusions
A
novel chemical printing method for a biological tissue based
on AuNP-assisted laser ablation was developed. Biomolecules from a
rat kidney tissue section have been successfully extracted and printed
onto a supporting substrate. Imaging mass spectrometric analysis showed
that the distribution of biomolecules in the printed sample was similar
to the histochemical distribution of the metabolites in the original
kidney tissue sections, showing that the integrity of the printed
sample was well-preserved in the printing process. The printing process
utilized efficient photoabsorption, laser-induced heating, and phase-transition
properties of AuNPs. The effects of laser fluence and thickness of
the AuNP thin film on the extraction/printing efficiency were systematically
investigated. In the mechanistic study, upon laser irradiation, a
thin layer of AuNPs on the tissue section would undergo rapid heating
and become transiently molten, which could facilitate the extraction
of biomolecules embedded in the tissue. The extracted biomolecules
would then be engulfed into the resolidified AuNPs, and subsequently
transferred to/printed on the opposite supporting substrate because
of the thermal and/or pressure gradient generated by laser irradiation.
The findings of this proof-of-principle study demonstrated that the
molecular printing of biological tissues can be achieved by employing
AuNPs and a UV laser. This printing technique would be suitable for
handling tiny samples (e.g., tissue sections and biopsies), which
might be challenging for conventional solvent extraction. Moreover,
the developed chemical printing technique will be able to transfer
the biomolecules from site-specific regions of a biological tissue
section to different types of supporting materials, such as nitrocellulose
membrane or paper, for other subsequent biochemical analysis with
the preservation of the original tissue samples.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Aspartic acid, hypoxanthine, glutamic acid,
and xanthine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA)
with a purity of 95% or above.

Animal Tissue and Sample
Preparation
Animal tissues
were collected in compliance with animal use and care regulation of
The University of Hong Kong. Frozen kidney tissues of a male Sprague
Dawley rat were cryosectioned (12 μm thickness) at −20
°C chamber temperature using a cryostat (FE/FSE, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Inc. Waltham, MA, USA) and thaw-mounted on clean TED glass
slides (thickness: 0.13–0.16 mm, 18 × 18 mm; Ted Pella,
Inc., Redding, CA, USA). The UV–visible absorption spectrum
of the TED glass slides in the range of 250–600 nm is shown
in Figure S6. Optimal cutting temperature
(OCT) solution was used to fix one side of the sample to the cryostat
support. To avoid contamination, particular care was taken to avoid
any contact of the OCT solution with the exposed side of the tissue.

Chemical Printing by AuNP-Assisted Laser Ablation
The
tissue sections mounted on clean glass slides were then coated with
a thin layer of AuNPs using argon-ion sputtering. The sputter coater
(SCD 005; Bal-Tec AG, Liechtenstein) was operated using an ultrahigh-purity
argon gas (99.999%) and a high-purity gold target (99.99%; Ted Pella,
Inc., Redding, CA, USA). For the molecular printing, the following
sputtering conditions were applied: sputtering current: 30 mA; sputtering
time: 30 s; distance between the gold target and the sample: 50–75
mm; and chamber pressure during sputtering: 0.04–0.06 mbar.

To perform the printing by the AuNP-assisted laser ablation, a
clean TED glass slide, which acted as a supporting substrate, was
placed on top of the AuNP-coated rat kidney tissue section to form
a sandwich-like setup (Figure 1). This sandwich-like setup was then mounted tightly on a
modified stainless steel MALDI sample plate using an electrically
conductive tape (9713 XYZ-Axis; 3M, St. Paul, MN, USA), with the supporting
substrate touching the MALDI sample plate. The indentation (117 ×
71 mm2 in area and 0.2 mm in depth) of the modified MALDI
plate was used to partly compensate for the thickness (0.26–0.32
mm) of the double-glass-slide setup. The tissue section with a thin
layer of AuNP coating was ablated by a pulsed laser (Nd:YAG solid-state
smartbeam laser with a wavelength of 355 nm and pulsed duration of
6 ns, Azura Laser AG, Berlin, Germany) with a firing frequency of
20 Hz to generate the printed sample on the supporting substrate.
The laser shot number for each raster position was set at 30, and
the raster step size was set at 70 μm. After laser ablation,
the optical images of the tissue sections and the printed samples
were recorded using a digital camera equipped with a macrolens (EOS
550D with EF 100 mm f/2.8 Marco USM, Canon, Japan).

To elucidate
the effects of laser fluence and thickness of AuNP
thin-film coating on the molecular-printing process, different laser
fluence range and different thickness of AuNP coating were adopted.
Laser fluence between 76 and 100% (67.2–126.4 mJ/cm2) was used to examine the effect of laser fluence on molecular printing.
Each tissue section for the study was coated with the same thickness
(5 nm) of AuNP coating. For studying the effect of thickness of AuNP
coating, different thicknesses of AuNP coating were generated by tuning
the distances between the gold target and tissue samples (including
75, 70, 65, 60, 55, and 50 mm). The thicknesses of the AuNP thin films
were determined to be 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5 nm using a
transmission electronic microscope (Figure S7). In addition, UV–visible absorption spectroscopic measurement
using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Cary 60 UV–vis,
Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was also performed to monitor
the increase in the AuNP-coating thickness, as the increment of AuNP-coating
thickness would increase the UV–visible absorption path length
and thus increase the absorbance generally (Figure S8). Each sample was ablated with a laser at the same laser
fluence (111 mJ/cm2). For both studies, the laser shot
number, firing frequency, and raster step size remained the same.

SALDI-MS was adopted to evaluate the extraction efficiency (i.e.,
the amount of biomolecules being transferred to the supporting substrate);
all of the printed samples were subsequently coated with AuNPs using
the same sputtering conditions (sputtering current: 30 mA; sputtering
duration: 20 s; sputtering distance: 53 mm; and chamber pressure during
sputtering: 0.04–0.06 mbar). The same conditions of AuNP coating
would ensure a fair comparison of the extraction efficiency.

SALDI-TOF
Mass Spectrometric Measurement
Ultraflex
II MALDI-TOF/TOF MS with a 355 nm solid-state laser (Bruker Daltonics,
Bremen, Germany) was employed for the molecular printing and SALDI-based
imaging MS analysis. The mass spectrometer was operated in a negative
reflectron mode. The ion source 1, ion source 2, lens, reflector 1,
and reflector 2 voltages were set at 20.00, 18.42, 8.18, 21.00, and
9.62 kV, respectively. The detector voltage was set at 1611 V. The
ion-extraction delay time was set to 850 ns for SALDI-based imaging
MS analysis. The laser fluence was set at a range between 80 and 86%
(89–104 mJ/cm2), with a firing frequency of 15 Hz.
The laser shot number for each raster position was set at 5, and the
raster step size was set at 70 μm. The effective dimension of
the laser spots in a circular shape was ∼135 × 135 μm.
The mass spectra were acquired in the m/z range of 20–800. The gold cluster ions (Au–, Au2–, and Au3–) generated from the AuNP-coated molecular-transferred sample were
employed for internal mass calibration. Instrument control and MS
data acquisition were performed using FlexControl software (version
2.4, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), and data processing was conducted
using FlexAnalysis software (version 1.2, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen,
Germany). The IMS data and molecular images were processed and exported
using BioMap software (version 3.8.0.3; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland).

Tandem mass spectrometric experiments were performed on a UltrafleXtreme
MALDI-TOF/TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) instrument with
a 355 nm solid-state laser (Nd:YAG solid state smartbeam II laser
with pulsed duration of 3 ns). LIFT mode was employed for recording
the dissociation of metastable ions of selected precursor ions by
laser-induced excitation. Precursor-ion-selection window range is
0.45% of the parent mass. The ion source 1, ion source 2, lens, reflector
1, and reflector 2 voltages were set at 7.49, 6.79, 3.50, 29.52, and
14.00 kV, respectively. The LIFT 1 and LIFT 2 voltages were set at
19.00 and 3.95 kV, respectively. The laser power was set to 50–80%
with a firing frequency of 100 Hz. The ion-extraction delay time was
set to 90 ns. The detector voltage was set at 2391 V.

Electron Microscopic
Examination
A scanning electron
microscope (S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope, Hitachi
High-Technologies, Japan) was employed for the examination of the
morphology and the size of AuNP coating on the rat kidney tissue surface
(before and after molecular printing) and on the supporting substrates
after molecular printing. A transmission electron microscope (Tecnai
G2 20 S-TWIN; FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) was employed for the examination
of the thickness of AuNP thin-film coating.
