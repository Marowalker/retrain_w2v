One of two-dimensional
transition metal dichalcogenide materials,
tungsten disulfide (WS2), has aroused much research interest,
and its mechanical properties play an important role in a practical
application. Here the mechanical properties of h-WS2 and
t-WS2 monolayers in the armchair and zigzag directions
are evaluated by utilizing the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
and machine learning (ML) technique. We mainly focus on the effects
of chirality, system size, temperature, strain rate, and random vacancy
defect on mechanical properties, including fracture strain, fracture
strength, and Young’s modulus. We find that the mechanical
properties of h-WS2 surpass those of t-WS2 due
to the different coordination spheres of the transition metal atoms.
It can also be observed that the fracture strain, fracture strength,
and Young’s modulus decrease when temperature and vacancy defect
ratio are enhanced. The random forest (RF) supervised ML algorithm
is employed to model the correlations between different impact factors
and target outputs. A total number of 3600 MD simulations are performed
to generate the training and testing dataset for the ML model. The
mechanical properties of WS2 (i.e., target outputs) can
be predicted using the trained model with the knowledge of different
input features, such as WS2 type, chirality, temperature,
strain rate, and defect ratio. The mean square errors of ML predictions
for the mechanical properties are orders of magnitude smaller than
the actual values of each property, indicating good training results
of the RF model.

1 Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted
the research interest
from both academia and industries due to their glorious properties,1−4 since graphene was successfully obtained from the graphite for the
first time using mechanical exfoliation in 2004.5 Although graphene possesses outstanding thermal, electrical,
and mechanical properties,6−8 the characteristic of zero band
gap limits its direct applications in nanoelectronics, such as field
effect transistors (FETs),9 which drives
the researcher to discover novel 2D materials with the desired semiconducting
features. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are emerging materials
with fascinating physical properties,10,11 which have
the chemical formula of MX2 (M is a transition metal atom
and X is a chalcogen atom). TMDCs have direct band gaps and can be
widely used in FETs,12 planar batteries,13 and nanogenerators.14 In the TMDC family, it has been demonstrated that tungsten disulfide
(WS2) has a direct energy gap of ∼2 eV, a strong
spin–orbit coupling, and the splitting of valence bands at
K/K′ points, which ensures that WS2 be the next-generation
candidate in nanoelectronics, spintronics, and optoelectronics.15−17 Ovchinnikov et al. have reported that the WS2-based FETs
displayed excellent electrical properties,18 such as the n-type behavior with a high room-temperature on/off
current ratio of ∼106. Moreover, at low temperatures,
the metallic behavior in the WS2-based FETs was possessed
at high charge carrier densities and mobilities as high as ∼140
cm2 V–1 s–1 (above
300 cm2 V–1 s–1 for
bilayers). The thermal conductivity of WS2 monolayer has
been evaluated by experimental measurement19 and first-principles theory,20 which
were equal to 32 W m–1K–1 and
31.8 W m–1 K–1, respectively.

Although the electrical and thermal properties of WS2 have
been widely investigated, its mechanical properties such as
the deformation and fracture under different temperatures and pressures
have not been given enough attention. Several works have been performed
to evaluate the mechanical properties of several other TMDCs. Bertolazzi
et al. experimentally measured Young’s moduli of monolayer
and bilayer MoS2 and the values were 270 ± 100 GPa
and 200 ± 100 GPa, respectively.21 By making use of the first-principles theory, Young’s moduli
of MoS2 were investigated to be 200.2 ± 0.2 GPa and
200.4 ± 0.4 GPa in armchair and zigzag directions, respectively;
the corresponding ultimate strengths were equal to 23.6 GPa and 16.1
GPa.22 The averaged Young’s modulus
of suspended MoS2 nanosheets was measured to be 330 ±
70 GPa, which was equivalent to graphene oxide.23 It has been displayed that the mechanical properties of
WSe2 were independent of the layer thickness.24 For multilayer WSe2, the fracture
strength and fracture strain were 12.4 GPa and 0.073, respectively,
and Young’s modulus was 167.3 ± 6.7 GPa. Also, by utilizing
the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, MoSe2 monolayer
was found to possess different fracture strengths and fracture strains
along the armchair and zigzag directions, which both decreased with
increased temperature.25 However, to the
best of our knowledge, there are no systematical investigations about
the mechanical properties of WS2 under the effects of different
phases, chiralities, temperatures, strain rates, and vacancy defects.
Therefore, it is worth evaluating the mechanical responses of WS2 to enrich this research gap.

Applications of machine
learning (ML) techniques in material science
have attracted growing attention in recent years.26−28 Most of the
models used in property predictions are supervised ML algorithms,
meaning the model needs to be trained on large amounts of dataset
to find the inherent correlations between the input features and output
targets. The dataset for ML algorithms can be obtained either experimentally
or numerically. For numerical studies, the generation of the training
dataset is computationally intensive and time consuming, which creates
a tremendous challenge. Recently, with the help of high-performance
supercomputers, the training dataset can be obtained within a reasonable
amount of time by carefully selecting and designing the sampling properties
and data structures. Random forest (RF) is a versatile and robust
ensemble ML algorithm based on decision trees for both classification
and regression problems,29 which can gain
accuracy as the trees grow without suffering from overtraining. It
has been successfully employed in several fields such as image classification,30 voice recognition,31 weather forecast,32 and material classification.33 On account of its extraordinary capability,
the RF algorithm is utilized to predict the mechanical properties
of WS2 with the help of MD generated training dataset in
this work.

TMDCs possess several structural phases on account
of the different
coordination spheres of the transition metal atoms. The features of
two stable phases are trigonal prismatic (h-phase) and octahedral
(t-phase) coordination of metal atoms. In this work, we systematically
apply MD and ML techniques to investigate the effects of WS2 type, chirality, size, temperature, strain rate, and defect ratio
on mechanical properties. First, the chirality dependence and size
dependence of mechanical properties of WS2 are evaluated.
Afterward, we analyze the effects of temperature, strain rate, and
vacancy defect on fracture performances of WS2. Finally,
after training the ML algorithm with MD results, ML is further applied
to predict the fracture strains, fracture strengths, and Young’s
moduli on h-WS2 and t-WS2.

2 Methodology
Random forest machine learning algorithm is an ensemble technique
that can be used in both classification and regression tasks. The
RF algorithm is composed of multiple decision trees (DTs)34 and a technique called Bootstrap Aggregation,
also known as bagging.35 It utilizes the
same learning algorithm but train each learner on a different set
of data. The RF algorithm combines multiple DTs in determining the
final output rather than relying on individual DTs. Mean square errors
(MSEs) are applied to assess the model performances, which is calculated
by the following equation 1  where n is the number
of
samples, i is the sample index, y is the target value, and ŷ is the predicted
value. An illustration of the RF algorithm is shown in Figure 1. Each box with a blue background
color represents an individual DT, and the RF is composed of an ensemble
of DTs. There are two general issues with ML model trainings, i.e.,
overfitting and underfitting. The overfitting problem can be caused
by the ML algorithm being too complex for the training data or the
dataset is too small. An overfitted model will predict the training
data with very high accuracy or very low MSE but has poor generalization
performances on the test or new data. This is due to the fact that
the model is learning from the noise of the data instead of the actual
relationships between variables. In contrast to overfitting, an underfitted
model could not describe the training data and therefore misses the
trends, which also means the model cannot be generalized to new data.
For example, underfitting could occur when using a linear model to
describe a second-order polynomial dataset. Since the RF algorithm
is a very versatile approach, underfitting is unlikely to occur for
the dataset used in this work. To battle the overfitting problem and
validate the trained model, a 10-fold cross-validation is used.

All simulations are performed utilizing the open source software
Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS).36Figure 2 displays the atomic configurations of h-WS2 and
t-WS2. The pink solid spheres represent W atoms, and yellow
solid spheres represent S atoms. The armchair and zigzag chiralities
are along the x direction and y direction,
respectively. To model the W and S atom interactions within the h-WS2 and t-WS2 monolayers, the two different Stillinger–Weber
potentials developed by Jiang et al. are employed, respectively.37 The time step is set as 0.5 fs. Periodic boundary
conditions are employed in all directions to eliminate the edge effects.
Moreover, we add a vacuum layer of 10 nm in the z direction to avoid the atomic interaction with the system image.
The simulation process is as follows: we first relax the original
WS2 structure using the Polak–Ribiere version of
the conjugate gradient algorithm. The system is then switched to the
isothermal–isobaric ensemble (NPT) to further eliminate the
system residuary stress at 0 bar for 300 ps. Thereafter, the WS2 system is elongated with a designated strain rate, where
the elongation of WS2 system will abide by the following
equation 2  where L0 is the
original system length, Lt is the length of the system at time t, and ε
is the strain rate. We apply the uniaxial displacement along either
the armchair or zigzag direction and hold the pressure along the other
two directions as zero. For each simulation, five independent simulations
with different velocity seeds (initial conditions) are performed,
and the final values are calculated by averaging each simulation with
the standard deviations shown as error bars.

of h-WS2. (c, d) Side and
top views of t-WS2.

We perform 3600 (2 types × 2 directions × 6 temperatures
× 5 strain rates × 6 defect ratios × 5 initial conditions)
MD simulations as input files to generate enough data points for the
ML algorithms, which are organized in a hierarchical structure. When
3600 MD simulations are finished, we collect all strain–stress
results and postprocess them using a MATLAB script. Afterward, the
fracture strain, fracture strength, and Young’s modulus with
a given type, direction, temperature, strain rate, and vacancy can
be extracted. Finally, 80% of MD results are then inputted into the
ML algorithms for the model training and 20% of the data points are
isolated to test the ML model performance.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Effects of Chirality and
Size
First,
the chirality dependence of the mechanical properties of WS2 is studied. The system is stretched after the relaxation process
in NPT at 1 K by employing a constant strain rate of 1 × 10–4 ps–1 in the armchair or zigzag
direction. The strain–stress relations for h-WS2 and t-WS2 with size 5.42 × 6.26 nm2 (x × y nm2) are depicted
in Figure 3. At the
small strain level, the linear variation in the strain–stress
curves can be observed from Figure 3, which reveals the elastic mechanical response. On
the contrary, the relation between stress and the applied strain under
high strain values becomes nonlinear, and plastic deformation generates
for both h-WS2 and t-WS2. Moreover, with the
further increased strain, the stress finally arrives at the maximum
value and suddenly drops down, which is due to the system fracture.
We attribute this elastic–plastic deformation transition to
the phase transformation in WS2 during elongation.25

Figure 3 Strain–stress profiles of h-WS2 and
t-WS2 in the zigzag and armchair directions at 1 K and
a strain
rate of 1 × 10–4 ps–1.

The fracture strength is defined
as the maximum stress the system
can withstand, and the corresponding strain represents the fracture
strain. The h-WS2 possesses the higher averaged fracture
strength and fracture strain in the armchair and zigzag directions,
which are equal to 14.74 GPa, 0.22 and 14.09 GPa, 0.25, severally.
However, the lower fracture strengths and strains for t-WS2 are 7.72 GPa, 0.15 and 7.65 GPa, 0.17, respectively. Afterward,
Young’s moduli of WS2 are calculated by fitting
the low strain level (<0.02) stress–strain curves. For h-WS2, the calculated Young’s moduli are 119.44 GPa and
117.89 GPa along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively,
and for t-WS2, the corresponding Young’s moduli
are 95.38 GPa and 94.11 GPa. We attribute the mechanical discrepancy
between h-WS2 and t-WS2 to the phase structure
difference. Due to the different coordination spheres of the transition
metal atoms, WS2 displays the discrepant bond stretching
and bending interactions in these two phases, which subsequently leads
to diverse physical properties. For instance, h-WS2 acts
as a semiconductor, whereas t-WS2 similar to metal has
no band gap.38 From Figure 3, we also find that there are weak anisotropies
in both h-WS2 and t-WS2 owing to the variations
of bond length (W–S and S–S) and bond angle (S–W–S)
under the tensile stress.39 To exhibit
the fracture differences between h-WS2 and t-WS2, Figure 4 displays
the crack propagations along the armchair direction. It can be observed
that the force required to break the bonding in t-WS2 is
much lower than that in h-WS2. This phenomenon coincides
with the results displayed in Figure 3. The similar phenomenon has been reported in other
2D materials.22,40,41 It has been reported that the calculated Young’s moduli of
borophene along the armchair and zigzag directions at 1 K are ∼1203
GPa and ∼562 GPa, respectively, and the obvious difference
mechanical properties between disparate chirality could be observed.40 Similarly, Mortazavi demonstrated that the ultimate
tensile strength of C3N monolayer in the armchair direction
was around 2.4 GPa larger than that in the zigzag direction.41 It should be noted that even though the mechanical
properties along different directions are similar at a low strain
level, the deformation behaviors at a high strain level depict the
significant discrepancy, which consists well with the first-principles
calculation of MoS2 monolayer.22

h-WS2 and (b) t-WS2. The color bar denotes the
atomic forces in the unit of eV Å–1.

In general, the physical properties
of 2D materials exhibit size
dependence with the effect of the material edge. For example, due
to phonon boundary scattering, the thermal conductivities of MoS2 and MoSe2 will decrease with the reduction of
the material length.11 Hence, it is significant
to investigate the size dependence of the mechanical properties of
WS2. Here we build other three dimensions of h-WS2 and t-WS2 monolayers with sizes 1.08 × 1.25, 10.84
× 12.52, and 21.69 × 25.04 nm2, aside from the
previous 5.42 × 6.26 nm2. The relations between calculated
fracture strain, fracture strength, and Young’s moduli and
system sizes are depicted in Figure 5. We can notice that the fracture strains, fracture
strengths, and Young’s moduli of h-WS2 and t-WS2 keep convergent with the varied size, which manifests that
WS2 shows size-independent in current size range. Therefore,
we choose the system of 5.42 × 6.26 nm2 in subsequent
MD simulations to save computational cost.

strain, (b) fracture strength, and
(c) Young’s modulus with system dimensions at 1 K and a strain
rate of 1 × 10–4 ps–1. Each
data point is averaged from five independent simulations with different
initial conditions. The error bars represent standard deviations.

3.2 Effects
of Temperature and Strain Rate
In practical applications,
the nanoelectronics is frequently operated
under versatile physical environment, for example, extreme temperature
and high loading strain rate, which can alter the mechanical properties
of structural materials or even cause unexpected structural failures.
Therefore, here we analyze the influences of temperature and strain
rate on the mechanical properties of the WS2.

Different
temperatures of 1, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 K are employed in the
NPT ensemble. In view of the similar variation trends for t-WS2, the strain–stress profiles for h-WS2 variations
with temperature are only displayed in Figure 6. It can be found that the increased temperature
makes the fracture phenomena arise earlier in both directions for
h-WS2. The fracture strain, fracture strength, and Young’s
modulus with different temperatures are also calculated by using the
same method in the above studies, which are depicted in Figure 7. When the temperature increases
from 1 to 500 K, the fracture strains along the armchair and zigzag
directions decline monotonically from 0.22 to 0.13, from 0.25 to 0.14
(for h-WS2) and from 0.15 to 0.06, from 0.17 to 0.07 (for
t-WS2); the corresponding fracture strengths accordingly
decrease by 22.79%, 19.92% and 40.65%, 39.82%. This temperature-induced
reduction in the WS2 mechanical properties resembles with
other 2D materials.42,43 The effect of temperature may
stem from the following three reasons: (1) The kinetic energy is transferred
into strain energy during the deformation due to tensile stress,
and the kinetic energy of atoms increases at the elevated temperature,
which decreases the strain energy.44 (2)
Due to the applied tensile stress, the binding energy between atoms
decreases, which generates the lower energy barrier for breaking the
chemical bonds.25,44,45 (3) The thermal fluctuations of atoms enhance at elevated temperature,
and cause that the lower energy barrier is more likely to be overcome.42 Based on the above discussion, we can deduce
that high temperature accelerates the fracture formation and propagations
in both h-WS2 and t-WS2. Although the fracture
strain and fracture strength exhibit the obvious temperature dependence,
the temperature sensitivity of Young’s modulus is relatively
slight. The calculated Young’s moduli along the armchair and
zigzag directions are slightly reduced from 119.44 to 113.59 GPa,
from 117.89 to 111.77 GPa (for h-WS2), and from 95.38 to
82.81 GPa, from 94.11 to 81.75 GPa (for t-WS2), severally.
It can also be observed that since t-WS2 are apt to deform,
the temperature sensitivities of the mechanical properties of t-WS2 are more obvious than those of h-WS2.

of strain–stress curves with temperature from
1 to 500 K for h-WS2 in the (a) zigzag and (b) armchair
directions with a constant strain rate of 1 × 10–4 ps–1.

and (c) Young’s modulus of h-WS2 and t-WS2 in the zigzag and armchair directions with a constant strain rate
of 1 × 10–4 ps–1. Each data
point is averaged from five independent simulations with different
initial conditions. The error bars represent standard deviations.

Moreover, we set different strain
rates of 1 × 10–4 (i.e., the aforementioned
strain rate), 2.5 × 10–4, 5 × 10–4, 1 × 10–3, and 2.5 × 10–3 ps–1 in
MD simulations to study the effect of strain rate. The relations
between strain rate and fracture strains, fracture strengths, and
Young’s moduli of h-WS2 and t-WS2 at
1 K are shown in Figure 8. We observe that the fracture strains and fracture strengths keep
almost unchanged and the calculated Young’s moduli have an
unconspicuous reduction with an increased strain rate. Our results
agree well with the previous results about the effect of strain rate
on the mechanical properties of MoSe2.25

and (c) Young’s modulus of h-WS2 and t-WS2 in the zigzag and armchair directions at 1 K.

3.3 Effect of Vacancy Defect
Previous
investigations have reported that vacancy defects can alter and tune
the physical and chemical properties of 2D materials.46,47 It has been observed that the electronic transport was transformed
by generating defect-induced localized states in defective MoS2.46 Furthermore, the increasing
vacancy defects decreased the thermal conductivity of graphene due
to the enhanced phonon defect scattering and the suppressed low frequency
phonons.47 The general method for the synthesis
of high-quality WS2 is chemical vapor deposition on SiO2/Si,48 hexagonal boron nitride,49 or reusable Au foil substrates.50 However, owing to the imperfection of chemically grown
process in 2D materials, structure defects including vacancies are
particularly noticeable.51 Therefore, it
is worthy of evaluating mechanical responses with different vacancy
defect ratios. In graphene monolayer, the type of defect can also
affect the thermal and mechanical properties, which includes the single-vacancy
defect, double-vacancy defect, multi-vacancy defect, and Stone–Wales
defect.52−55 To investigate the effect of defects on the mechanical properties
in WS2, we created random defects including different vacancy
defect types with vacancy concentration from 0 to 5% in both h-WS2 and t-WS2.

Effects of vacancy defect on
the mechanical properties of h-WS2 and t-WS2 at 1 K and 1 × 10–4 ps–1 are shown in Figure 9. When the vacancy defect ratio increases from 0 to 5%, the fracture
strengths for h-WS2 and t-WS2 in the armchair
and zigzag directions will decrease by 48.35%, 49.67% and 44.26%,
48.73%, respectively; the decline proportions of the fracture strain
are 54.89%, 60.41% and 51.30%, 62.10%. Moreover, the corresponding
Young’s moduli strictly reduce from 119.44 to 92.15 GPa, from
117.89 to 90.00 GPa and from 95.38 to 73.62 GPa, from 94.11 to 72.44
GPa with vacancy defects up to 5%. The similar effect of vacancy
defects has been observed in other 2D systems.22,42,56 Gan et al. using the first-principles theory
investigated the effect of regular vacancy defect, i.e., 3 ×
3 × 1 MoS2 supercell structure with one sulfur missing
vacancy, on Young’s moduli and ultimate strengths. They found
that this vacancy defect could reduce Young’s moduli and fracture
strengths from 200.0 ± 0.2 to 194.2 ± 0.2 GPa, from 23.6
to 17.8 GPa and from 200.4 ± 0.2 to 191.8 ± 0.4 GPa, from
16.1 to 15.4 GPa in the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.22 The defect dependence of mechanical properties
of phosphorene was investigated by utilizing the MD simulations. When
the vacancy concentration was 2%, in comparison with the pristine
structure, the fracture strength of phosphorene along the armchair
and zigzag directions decreased by 39% and 41%, respectively; the
corresponding fracture strains dropped by 34% and 39%.42 The effect of vacancy defect may be attributed
to the following points: (1) The WS2 monolayers have stress
concentration at the vacancy defects, where the stress concentration
can affect the fracture behaviors.57,58 (2) The fracture
of WS2 monolayers is originated by the nucleation of a
vacancy defect, and the increasing vacancy defect enhances the nucleation
phenomenon. (3) The integrity of pristine WS2 can be broken
by vacancy defects, and the vacancies disorder and weaken the W–S
bond interaction.22,42,56 As a consequence, the subsistent vacancy defects accelerate the
formation and extension of crack under the tensile stress.

strength, and (c) Young’s modulus of h-WS2 and t-WS2 in the zigzag and armchair directions at 1 K and a strain

3.4 Machine
Learning Predictions
The
mechanical properties of h-WS2 and t-WS2 are
calculated in both zigzag and armchair directions under six different
temperatures, five different strain rates, and six different defect
ratios. Therefore, each data point is associated with five input features,
i.e., type, chirality, temperature, strain rate, and defect ratio,
and three output target values, i.e., fracture strain, fracture strength,
and Young’s modulus. The dataset is split into training and
testing with portions of 80% and 20%, respectively. We use a 10-fold
cross-validation to inspect the accuracies of trained models for the
sake of flagging overfitting or selection bias. It should be noticed
that the dataset is split using a stratified method rather than the
random method, which can ensure the effect of the most important feature
on the training results. Figure 10 displays the evaluated Pearson’s correlation
between each pair of input features and output targets. The correlation
coefficient ranges from −1 to 1 corresponding to the strongest
negative and positive correlations. It is observed that the type of
WS2 has the strongest impact on its fracture strain, fracture
strength, and Young’s modulus. However, since there are only
two categories for the WS2 types, it is less likely to
have a biased data selection compared to other features. Therefore,
the second most significant impact factor, i.e., defect, is used for
the data split. We employ the feature scaling to get better results
and normalize all input values between 0 and 1 to uniform the distribution
of feature spaces.

Figure 10 Pearson’s correlations among different features
and target
outputs.

To find the best parameter for
the RF algorithm, a grid search
method is used to determine the optimal values to be used for the
hyperparameters. Two hyperparameters, i.e., max-depth and n-estimator,
are optimized in the grid search. The max-depth refers to the maximum
depth of the tree and n-estimator is the number of the trees in the
forest. Ideally, the performance of the model will increase with the
growing number of trees but one needs to be cautious to avoid the
overfitting problems. A list of max-depth values ranging from 3 to
10 is explored. For n-estimator, different values of 1, 10, 100, 1000,
and 2000 are used. The best combinations of max-depth and n-estimator
are 9 and 1000, respectively. A 10-fold cross-validation is conducted
to verify the accuracy of the trained model as well as overfitting.
Once the model is trained, the RF regressor is used to predict the
mechanical properties of WS2 on the test data. As shown
in Figure 11, the
predicted mechanical properties from the trained RF model soundly
match those generated from the MD simulations, indicating the validity
of the ML model. The overall MSEs for fracture strain, fracture strength,
and Young’s modulus are 9.2 × 10–6,
1.9 × 10–2 GPa, and 3.8 GPa, respectively,
which are several orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding
properties.

strength,
and (c) Young’s modulus with MD simulation results. The red
and black square dots represent ML predicted and target values, respectively.

Even though the mechanical properties
of h-WS2 and t-WS2 monolayers can be successfully
predicted by the RF regressor,
it is worth noting that there are some limitations associated with
the current trained model. To save computational time, only five impact
factors including system type, chirality, temperature, strain rate,
and defect were considered in this work. Therefore, the model cannot
be employed on systems where other impact factors such as isotopic
doping or chemical functionalization existence; otherwise, the addition
of each new impact factor would drastically bring out the increase
of computational time. Meanwhile, the model is specifically trained
on the mechanical properties of WS2, and new train datasets
are required for other materials. Nevertheless, the successful implementation
of the machine learning technique to mechanical property prediction
sheds some light on data-driven materials studies and paves the way
for solving engineering problems using the state-of-the-art artificial
intelligence approach.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion,
the mechanical properties of h-WS2 and
t-WS2 monolayers are investigated systematically using
the MD simulations and machine learning technique. The trained ML
model can predict the mechanical properties of WS2 with
the knowledge of input features including WS2 type, chirality,
temperature, strain rate, and defect ratio. The MSEs between ML predicted
and MD simulation generated results are 9.2 × 10–6, 1.9 × 10–2 GPa, and 3.8 GPa for fracture
strain, fracture strength, and Young’s modulus, respectively,
which are several orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding
properties. On account of the different coordination spheres of the
transition metal atoms, the fracture strain, fracture strength, and
Young’s modulus of t-WS2 are lower than those of
h-WS2. The fracture strain reduction ratios of h-WS2 and t-WS2 in the armchair and zigzag directions
are 41.20%, 43.08% and 57.78%, 60.82%, respectively, as the temperature
enhances from 1 to 500 K. Furthermore, the fracture strengths accordingly
decrease by 22.79%, 19.92% and 40.65%, 39.82%. We attribute the decrease
of mechanical properties to the decreased strain energy, the decreased
binding energy, and the enhanced atoms thermal fluctuations. The fracture
strains and fracture strengths are almost unchanged, and the calculated
Young’s moduli have the trivial reduction with the increased
strain rate. The increasing vacancy defect from 0 to 5% is found to
decrease the fracture strain, fracture strength, and Young’s
modulus on account of the stress concentrations, the increasing fracture
nucleation, the disorderly W–S bonds, and the material softening.
