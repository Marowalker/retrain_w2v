A Si-based
anode maintaining its high electrochemical performance
with cycles was prepared for the nondegradable lithium-ion battery.
Nanoscaled Si particles were mechanochemically coupled with approximately
3 nm thick oxide layer and n-carbon (nanoscaled carbon) crystallites
to overcome silicon’s inherent problems of poor electronic
conductivity and severe volume change during lithiation and delithiation
cycling. The oxide layer of SiOx was chemically
formed via a controlled oxygen environment during the process; meanwhile,
the n-carbon crystallites were obtained by mechanical fragmentation
from ∼70 μm sized multilayered graphene powders with
a low degree of agglomeration. The Si-based composite anode, processed
by the above-mentioned mechanochemical coupling, maintained a superior
discharge capacity of 1767 mA h/g through 100 cycles with a Coulombic
efficiency exceeding 98% at a current density of 100 mA/g. According
to our current study, the coupling of the Si particles with oxide
layer and n-carbon crystallites was found to be a significantly efficient
way to prevent the performance degradation of the Si-based anode.

Introduction
Modern electronic products
require higher energy capacity and longer
lifetime for power source, such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).1 Graphite, a popular anode material for LIBs,
is known to possess a layered structure that could dampen any volume
change arising from the intercalation and deintercalation of lithium
ions, resulting in a longer lifetime of the anode electrode. Despite
the excellent cyclic stability, graphite exhibits a serious drawback
of relatively low theoretical capacity of 372 mA h/g.2,3

On the other hand, Si materials for the LIBs possess a high
specific
capacity of approximately 4200 mA h/g, but several critical issues,
such as high capacity irreversibility and cyclic instability, need
to be resolved.4−7 The high capacity irreversibility and cyclic instability are caused
by the inherent low electronic conductivity and large volume change
of silicon during lithium-ion insertion/extraction.8,9 Extensive
approaches, such as the application of nanoscaled Si particles along
with carbon coating, have been made to overcome their low electronic
conductivity and large volume change in the anode Si-based electrode.10−17 However, the electrochemical performance through the approaches
mentioned above showed a limited improvement; the discharge capacities
measured decreased to less than 1500 mA h/g even before 50 cycles.

Recently, various graphene materials with a high conductivity,
large surface area, and mechanical flexibility have been employed
to improve the performance of Si-based anode materials.18−27 The performance and fabrication method of the Si/graphene composites
are summarized in Table 1. The composites in the form of graphene sheets are prepared by various
methods of hybridizing,18 wrapping,19 encapsulating,20,21 nanostructuring,22 and mixing23−27 of the Si particles with graphene (or reduced graphene
oxide, rGO) materials. Liu et al. reported a reversible capacity of
1433 mA h/g after 100 cycles with a membrane-structured Si/rGO bilayer
at 100 mA/g (capacity retention of about 78.9%).22 Chen et al. synthesized Si nanoparticles and ball-milled
for 10 h with a sole purpose of mixing with graphene oxide, followed
by a reduction process. The Si/graphene nanocomposite electrode with
modified binders was fabricated. The prepared anode showed a considerably
improved discharge capacity of 725 mA h/g (capacity retention of about
43.1%) after 50 cycles compared with 484 mA h/g (capacity retention
of about 31.2%) with a conventional binder of carboxymethyl cellulose
(CMC) at 400 mA/g.25 On the basis of the
previous studies on the Si/graphene (or rGO) composite anodes in the
form of graphene sheet, cyclic stability seems to be markedly improved
by the employment of graphene materials rather than carbon coating,
but the enhancement of capacity retention was still limited.

In the current study, a Si-based
composite anode of Si/SiOx/n-carbon crystallites
was fabricated by
a mechanochemical coupling process to take full advantage of the inherent
characteristics of crystalline Si, oxide, and carbon crystallites,
for the benefit of high capacity and cyclic stability of LIBs. The
graphene of tens of microns was mechanically fragmented into n-carbon
crystallites and simultaneously coupled with the Si particles in a
uniform manner and without losing the crystallinity of the Si material.
Meanwhile, the particles have gone through a chemical process through
a controlled oxygen atmosphere to form a nanothick oxide layer onto
the surface of the particles. The morphology and microstructural changes
in the fabricated composite anode were investigated and discussed
in connection with the electrochemical performance.

Results and Discussion
The mechanochemical coupling process adopted to fabricate the Si/SiOx/n-carbon crystallite composite is schematically
shown in Figure 1a.
For the process, spherical Si particles with the diameter of about
100 nm were mixed with rGO multilayered sheets in the size range of
∼70 μm in a chamber filled with 3–5 mm zirconia
balls, which is connected with Ar and oxygen gas lines. Figure 1b shows X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns for the composite samples that were processed for various
times from 0 min to 24 h. Main diffraction patterns for cubic crystalline
Si are observed for the processed samples up to 30 min at 28.4°,
47.3°, and 56.1°, which correspond to (111), (220), and
(311) lattice planes, respectively. However, the sample processed
for more than 1 h showed a peak of SiO2 and a considerably
decreased principal Si peak at 28.4°, suggesting the development
of crystalline SiO2 (stishovite phase) at the expense of
Si. This result is consistent with the oxygen percentage analysis
performed with the samples, as summarized in Table 2. This result was also confirmed by the abrupt
discharging capacity decrease with the sample processed for 1 h, as
shown in Figure 4a.
In addition, the appearance of broad patterns after 24 h processing
indicates that the crystalline structure of SiO2 (stishovite
phase) turned into a disordered structure.

The Raman spectra obtained from the samples in Figure 1b show the characteristic peaks
for carbonaceous materials, as shown in Figure 1c. Broad peaks at 1350 and 1590 cm–1 represent the D and G disordered bands induced and graphitic features,
respectively.28 The measured D/G peak intensity ratios of the samples increase from
0.74 to 0.99, indicating a microstructure with a higher fraction of
disordered structure at up to 1 h and then cannot be measured at more
than 1 h because of the final change in multilayered rGO particles
into noncrystalline carbon particles. Notably, the intensity of a
sharp peak at 519 cm–1, an indication of the presence
of Si, moved gradually to 512, 506, 505, 504, and 500 cm–1 with the respective processing time of 10 min, 30 min, 1, 2, and
24 h, suggesting that Si particles are mechanically stressed and turn
into an amorphous structure.29,30

The change in
the morphology and mapping of the principal elements
of C and Si in the composite samples after a selected processing time
for 0 min, 30 min, and 1 h is observed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM)/focused ion beam (FIB), as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a–c shows the morphology change with processing
time. Meanwhile, Figure 2d–f displays the elemental mapping in the samples, in which
yellow and blue color refer to carbon and Si element, respectively.
From Figure 2a, a multilayered
graphene sheet is observed to be present separately with spherical
Si particles before the mechanochemical coupling process. The corresponding
elemental mapping is shown in Figure 2d, which is coincident with the layout of the graphene
and Si elements. With the progress of the mechanochemical coupling
process, the multilayer graphene was transformed into a particular
shape and intermixed with the Si particles as observed in Figure 2b,c, where (b,c)
refers to the morphology after 30 min and 1 h processing, respectively.
The elemental mapping of the samples after 30 min (refers to Figure 2e) and 1 h (refers
to Figure 2f) processing,
however, showed a clear contrast among them. Mostly, carbon particles
seemed to occupy the void formed among the Si particles that are loosely
combined with 30 min processing, resulting in the apparent carbon
dominant mapping, as shown in Figure 2e. It can be inferred from this observation that the
multilayered graphene sheets have gone through brittle fracturing
and transformed into smaller particular powders and filled the voids
among the loosely combined Si particles. On the other hand, 1 h processing
gave rise to cold welding of the slightly deformed Si particles, culminating
in the agglomerated lump of Si. The fractured, relatively smaller
carbon particles were distributed onto the Si lump, resulting in the
larger Si dominant mapping as observed in Figure 2f. These results are well in accord with
the XRD and Raman data exhibited in Figure 1b,c, where the 1 h processed sample showed
the crystallinity loss of Si and increased disorder in the graphene
structure.

the samples with a selected processing time for (d) 0 min, (e) 30

respectively.

To investigate the effect
of the process on the oxidation of Si
particles, we conducted energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analysis
with the selected samples obtained before and after 30 min and 1 h
processing. As expected, Si particles were progressively oxidized
with the processing time. The results are summarized in Table 2. The oxide layer observed in
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) exhibited thicknesses of about
3–5 and 8–10 nm after 30 min and 1 h processing, respectively
(Figure S1).

A closer observation
of the processed samples was carried out by
high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images, with elemental mapping showing
more detailed morphology changes with processing time. Figure 3a–c shows the detailed
morphologies of the samples after 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h processing.
The corresponding carbon mapping is shown in Figure 3d–f. A single, not agglomerated Si
particle of about 100 nm is observed, as in Figure 3a. After 1 h processing, the Si particles
were observed to be agglomerated, as explained in Figure 2. With 2 h processing, severely
fractured and agglomerated Si particles were observed, as shown in Figure 3c. The carbon mappings
showed the carbon particles distributed into voids among the Si particles
(Figure 3d) and onto
the Si lump (Figure 3e,f), confirming the observation explained in Figure 2e,f.

The first charge–discharge performance of
the samples was
investigated in a voltage range of 0.01–1.5 V with a loading
current of 100 mA/g, as shown in Figure 4a. The first discharging
capacity of the sample before the mechanochemical coupling process
was measured as 1753 mA h/g with the reversibility of 58.6%. Compared
with 4200 mA h/g of the Si material, the lower capacity was expected
owing to the oxide naturally formed onto the Si particles (refer to Table 2) in the electrode.
The discharge capacity was increased to 2000 mA h/g with a reversibility
of 70.7% after 10 min of the process. This enhancement had been achieved
due to the formation of a physical bond between Si particles and n-carbon
crystallites in the agglomerate. The discharge capacity was markedly
increased to 2151 mA h/g after 30 min processing with a higher reversibility
of 73.5%. This substantial improvement originates from the sturdy
coupling between Si particles and n-carbon crystallites, as well as
the effect of a homogeneous agglomerate size and superior particle
density, as shown in Figure 2b. On the other hand, the discharge capacity was drastically
decreased to 1038 and 520 mA h/g after 1 and 2 h processing, respectively.
The abrupt performance deterioration is associated with the destruction
of the efficient network structure for steady electronic conduction
caused by severe agglomeration and fracturing of the particles, as
observed in Figure 2c. On the basis of the comparison of the performance with the morphology
and structure of the samples, the uniform distribution of the Si particles
onto the n-carbon crystallite support material and the optimal physical
coupling between materials seem to play a pivotal role in the improvement
of the performance of the Si-based anode. The composite after 30 min
processing exhibits a considerably higher tap density of ∼0.730
g/cm3 compared with nanosized Si (∼0.131 g/cm3).

at various loading currents and (e) cycling performance up to 300
cycles except for initial cycles at 100 mA/g (charging curve: dash
line, discharging curve: straight line, charging capacity: close point,
and discharging capacity: open point).

The effect of the mechanochemical coupling on the performance
was
also investigated with a sample. The sample was prepared as follows:
each rGO and Si particles were mechanochemical-coupling-processed
for 30 min separately, and then they were simply mixed to fabricate
an electrode by a mortar and pestle. The measured initial discharging
capacity and reversibility of the sample showed a considerably lower
initial discharging capacity of 1020 mA h/g and a reversibility of
40%, compared with 2151 mA h/g and 73.5%, respectively, of the sample
processed for 30 min of mechanochemical coupling as suggested above,
verifying the effectiveness of the process (Figure S2).

The cyclic stabilities of the samples were monitored
with charge–discharge
capacity variations for up to 100th cycle as measured in Figure 4b at 100 mA/g with
cutoff potentials of 0.01 and 1.5 V versus Li/Li+. The
discharge capacity, 1690 mA h/g, of the sample prior to the mechanochemical
coupling remained relatively stable for up to around 30th cycle and
subsequently decreased abruptly and continuously to less than 1000
mA h/g. The abrupt discharging capacity decrease was also observed
in the previous reports.31,32 This result implies
that the coupling between Si particles and rGO was not strong enough
to overcome the accumulated strain caused by the repeated volume change
in Si during charge–discharge cycles, resulting in the drastic
discharging capacity decline after 30 cycles because of the disconnection
of Si particles from the rGO electronic network. By contrast, samples
that were processed for up to 30 min maintained a high discharging
capacity (about 1661 mA h/g for 10 min and 1767 mA h/g for 30 min
processed samples) during 100 cycles. These outstanding results seemed
to originate from the formation of agglomerate of Si particles and
n-carbon crystallites, as well as the oxide shell formed onto the
Si particle. On the contrary, the samples processed for 1 h and longer
showed a markedly lower discharging capacity with the cycle, less
than 500 mA h/g after 10 cycles for a 1 h processed sample and less
than 100 mA h/g after 10 cycles for a 2 h processed sample. These
results are in good agreement with the XRD and morphology observation
for the samples processed for 2 h and longer; the failure of steady
electronic conduction by n-carbon crystallites is due to severe agglomeration
and fracture of the composite (Figure 2e). We can infer from the results discussed above that
the sturdy and stable bonding among the constituent elements of the
composite anode (such as Si and n-carbon crystallites) is an important
factor to maintain high discharging capacity and to improve the cyclic
performance of the composite anode, which was achieved in our study
by a mechanochemical coupling process for an optimized short period
of 30 min.

To confirm the superiority of n-carbon crystallite material to support
Si electrode by the mechanochemical coupling process, we prepared
and tested a set of composite materials composed of Si/Super P (SP,
TIMCAL, Super P Li, a conventional conducting carbon for electrodes);
sample (C) was manually mixed using a mortar and pestle, and sample
(D) was mechanochemical-coupling-processed for 30 min. Sample (C) abruptly decreased the discharge capacity with cycles
because of severe volume change during lithiation (charge) and delithiation
(discharge) cycling, and sample (B) showed a relatively high stability
with cycles but markedly lower discharge capacities compared with
the counterpart prepared with rGO instead of Super P, suggesting that
rGO is an optimum supporting material for the Si electrode by mechanochemical
coupling (Figure S3).

Meanwhile,
electrical resistances of the samples before cyclic
testing are shown in Figure 4c with the Nyquist plots measured by electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS). The resistance of the samples is observed to gradually
decrease with the process for up to 30 min and then markedly increased
with 2 h processing. The resistance changes observed in EIS are consistent
with the variation in initial discharging capacity and reversibility
of the samples; the changes are reduced with the process time of up
to 30 min and then abruptly increased after 1 h processing. These
results support the effect of the sound coupling for the electronic
network between Si particles and n-carbon crystallites.

The
cyclic stability at various current rates was also examined
with the sample, which had been processed for 30 min to see the high-speed
charge and discharge performance. At different currents ranging from
100 to 5000 mA/g, the sample showed a stable performance (Figure 4d). Compared with
the case of 100 mA/g in Figure 4b, the sample also showed high cyclic stability at a high
loading current of 500 mA/g, as shown in Figure 4e, maintaining discharge capacity of approximately
1300 mA h/g through 300 cycles. In comparison, a mixture of Si/rGO
particles prepared without the process showed severe discharging capacity
decay, validating the effectiveness of the mechanochemical coupling
process.

Conclusions
In summary, for improving the electrochemical
performance of the
Si-based anode for the LIBs, a mechanochemical coupling process was
pursued to provide an active Si material with the physical stability
and electronic conductivity during charge–discharge cycles.
The process was implemented by coupling nanosized Si particles to
the excellent electronic network of n-carbon crystallites, with the
simultaneous formation of SiOx layer onto
the Si particles. Unlike the conventional way of utilizing the graphene
in the form of sheets, the multilayered graphene sheet was, in our
study, fragmented into particular type powders and made to direct
contact with the individual, not agglomerated Si particles to maximize
the effective contact surface among them. The mechanochemical coupling
process was carried out by making use of a planetary ball mill under
a controlled oxygen atmosphere. The Si@SiOx/n-carbon crystallite composite anode fabricated by the process for
an optimized period of 30 min showed excellent performance; a high
discharging capacity of 1767 mA h/g (corresponding to 1289 mA h/cm3) was maintained through 100 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency
of more than 98% except for initial cycles at a current density of
100 mA/g. The excellent performance appears to be attributed to the
mechanochemical coupling, a facile and economical method to fabricate
a high-performance composite electrode, in which n-carbon crystallites
have been utilized to physically and electronically support the Si@SiOx particles.

Experimental Section
Material
Preparation
A set of homogeneous mixture was
prepared with Si nanopowder (99%, APS ≈ 100 nm, Alfa Aesar
Co.) and rGO powder (RGO-V30-100, STANDARD GRAPHENE Co.) in a weight
ratio of 80:20 using a mortar and pestle for 10 min. Then, the prepared
mixture was mechanochemical-coupling-processed under a controlled
oxygen environment in a high-energy planetary mill loaded with 5 and
3 mm zirconia balls in a weight ratio of 2:1 at 300 rpm for 10 min
to 24 h. The synthesized Si@SiOx/n-carbon
crystallite composites were finally annealed at 900 °C for 3
h under an Ar + 4% H2 atmosphere.

Characterization
To examine the morphology, crystallinity,
and microstructure of the samples, SEM with FIB, XRD (Rigaku D/max
2500 diffractometer) using Cu Kα radiation, confocal
Raman microscopy (FEX, Nost Co., Ltd) with 532 nm wavelength incident
laser light, and TEM (HR-TEM, JEM-3010, JEOL Ltd) were utilized. Tap
density of the samples was measured according to the ISO 3953 procedure.
Electrochemical characterization for the as-prepared Si@SiOx/n-carbon crystallite electrode was done with CR2032
coin-type cells, in which a metal lithium foil was used as the counter
electrode. All 40 μm thick electrode (about 0.45 mg/cm2) in the cells were prepared by mixing the Si@SiOx/n-carbon crystallite composite as an active material powder
and NaCMC (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) binder
in a weight ratio of 90:10 to form a homogeneous slurry in deionized
water without additional conducting carbon black powder. A solution
of 1.2 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate
and dimethyl carbonate (3:7 v/v, PANAX ETEC) containing 1% vinylene
carbonate (VC) additive was used as the electrolyte. The electrodes
were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 24 h, turning the electrode
thickness to about 20 μm, before being transferred into an Ar-filled
glovebox for cell assembly. The coin cells were charged and discharged
between 0.01 and 1.5 V versus Li/Li+ by applying a loading
current of 100 mA/g at 25 °C for electrochemical characterization.
By using an EIS (Bio-Logic Co., VMP3), we carried out impedance analyses
with a Nyquist plot in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 mHz with
an ac amplitude of 10 mV. The cyclic stability of the samples was
also examined through 100 cycles at 100 mA/g and higher loading currents.
