To
investigate the effect of carbohydrate moieties on the pharmacokinetic
profile of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitors, carbohydrated
derivatives of the established PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceutical PSMA
I&T were developed and evaluated. As observed for the reference
PSMA I&T, the natGa/natLu complexes of the
respective galactose-, mannose-, and cellobiose-conjugated analogs
showed high PSMA affinity. Carbohydration had almost no effect on
the lipophilicity, whereas PSMA-mediated internalization was reduced.
The specific binding toward human serum albumin (HSA) decreased from
78.6% for [natLu]PSMA I&T to 19.9% for the natLu-labeled cellobiose derivative. Compared to [68Ga]PSMA
I&T, [68Ga]PSMA galactose displayed lower nonspecific
tissue and kidney accumulation but also slightly lower tumor uptake
in small-animal positron emission tomography (μPET) imaging.
Biodistribution studies confirmed reduced unspecific uptake in nontarget
tissue and decreased renal accumulation of the metabolically stable
[68Ga]PSMA galactose derivative, resulting in overall improved
tumor-to-tissue ratios. However, carbohydration has no significant
beneficial in vivo effect on the targeting performance of PSMA I&T.
Nevertheless, carbohydration expands the repertoire of feasible modifications
within the linker area and might be a valuable tool for the future
development of PSMA inhibitors with decreased kidney uptake.

==== Body
Introduction
Prostate-specific membrane
antigen (PSMA), a type II transmembrane
protein, was discovered to be considerably overexpressed on most prostate
cancer (PCa) cells and to correlate with its expression level the
more advanced the disease becomes.1−4 The exceptional target characteristics of
PSMA enabled the development of radiolabeled PSMA inhibitors and antibodies
for imaging and endoradiotherapy of PCa.5−11 Although [68Ga]PSMA-HBED-CC (Figure 1) is the most widely studied PSMA agent for
clinical PCa-PET imaging, [177Lu]PSMA I&T and [177Lu/225Ac]PSMA-617 (Figure 1) are currently used for endoradiotherapy
of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).12−15

Radioligand therapy with [177Lu]PSMA I&T is well
tolerated and has been demonstrated to be an efficient treatment option
in advanced mCRPCa. No renal toxicity was observed, and only a few
cases of heavily pretreated patients developed grade 3 or 4 hematological
toxicity, thus confirming the safety of [177Lu]PSMA I&T.13 Dosimetric studies revealed that tumor lesions
received the highest radiation doses (3.3 mGy/MBq), followed by the
parotid glands (1.3 mGy/MBq) and the kidneys (0.8 mGy/MBq), which
shows the parotid glands and the kidneys to be dose limiting.14 On the basis of the experience gained so far,
patients have already been treated with up to 10 cycles of 177Lu-labeled PSMA inhibitors without significant side effects, which
relativizes the focus on the kidney as a “dose-limiting organ.”
However, a reduction of unwanted tissue uptake is generally recommended
during the drug development of radiolabeled tracers to reduce the
possible adverse effects.

A well-established approach to reduce
unwanted renal accumulation
of peptidic tracers and to enhance their in vivo elimination is the
introduction of carbohydrate moieties.16−19 Several investigations have shown
that the conjugation of a carbohydrate can significantly alter the
in vivo and in vitro parameter and thus, for instance, reduce the
kidney uptake, reduce unspecific tissue binding, or improve the overall
biodistribution profile of the radiolabeled ligand. Therefore, with
the intention to develop a PSMA inhibitor with low kidney uptake,
we used PSMA I&T as a starting point and introduced a free amine
group within the suberic acid spacer for rapid derivatization. After
the conjugation of three different thio-linked carbohydrate moieties
(two monosaccharides: galactose, mannose; one diglycoside: cellobiose),
we evaluated the novel carbohydrated compounds with respect to the
most important parameters, such as affinity, internalization, and
lipophilicity. Additionally, we investigated the effect of carbohydration
on albumin binding. On the basis of the in vitro data, [68Ga]PSMA galactose was selected for a further comparative in vivo
evaluation with [68Ga]PSMA I&T in CB-17 severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) mice.

Results
Synthesis
The
introduction of thioglycosides into the
linker region was achieved using Fmoc-l-Asu(OtBu)-OH as the starting point (Figure 2). The protection of the free carboxylic group and
the concomitant removal of the tBu protecting group
with trifluoroacetic acid yielded 90% of 4 after RP-HPLC
purification. Coupling of 4 with the binding motif 1 and subsequent benzyl deprotection resulted in 92% yield
of 7. DOTAGA-(I-y)fk was synthesized as previously published
and condensed with 7 to establish 9 without
further purification.20 After Fmoc and
subsequent tBu deprotection, 10 was
obtained in 41% yield after RP-HPLC purification. Condensation of 10 with the PfpOH-activated thioglycosides 11, 12, and 13 facilitated the final carbohydrated
derivatives 14, 15, and 16 in
yields of 3 to 10% after deacetylation and purification via RP-HPLC.

Radiochemistry
68Ga Labeling
The synthesis of the 68Ga-labeled PSMA inhibitors (e.g.,
5.0 nmol) was achieved
within 15 min after the start of the radiosynthesis and resulted in
specific activities ranging from 35 to 53 GBq/μmol after cartridge
purification. The radiochemical purity for all compounds was ≥97%.

177Lu Labeling
With minor modifications
to the previously published protocol, 177Lu labeling was
accomplished with radiochemical purities ≥98% and specific
activities ranging from 10 to 53 GBq/μmol.21

125I Labeling
([125I]I-BA)KuE,
the reference ligand for all in vitro studies, was synthesized according
to procedures mentioned in the literature.20,22−24 Destannylation of the precursor 17 was
achieved with [125I]NaI and peracetic acid within 10 min
at room temperature. Consecutive cartridge purification, tBu deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid, and purification via RP-HPLC
resulted in the final product ([125I]I-BA)KuE with a radiochemical
purity ≥99% and a radiochemical yield of 41 ± 10%.

PSMA Affinity (IC50)
Binding to PSMA was
determined using LNCaP human prostate cancer cells in a competitive
binding assay with the natGa or natLu analogs
of 14, 15, and 16 and ([125I]I-BA)KuE (c = 0.2 nM) as the radioligand.
For comparison, the IC50 values of PSMA I&T (1) were taken from a previous publication,7 in which the same binding assay was performed. The results
given in Table 1 show
that the affinities of the monosaccharide derivatives 14 and 15 were not significantly higher compared to that
of the reference PSMA I&T (1). The introduction of
the disaccharide cellobiose (16) lowered the affinity,
also not significantly. The different stereochemistry of the carbohydrates
used in 14 and 15 showed minimal effect
on the binding affinity.

were performed using LNCaP cells (150 000/well) and ([125I]I-BA)KuE (c = 0.2 nM) as the radioligand.
Cells were incubated in HBSS (1% BSA) at 4 °C for 1 h. Internalization

binding (%) was determined via HPLC and nonlinear regression calibration
using the tR of the natGa-
and natLu-labeled PSMA inhibitors.* = P > 0.05; ** = P < 0.05.

Internalization
LNCaP cells were
used to investigate
the cell surface binding and internalization of the 68Ga-
and 177Lu-labeled compounds 14, 15, and 16. The cell surface-bound fraction after 60 min
incubation ranged from 0.6 to 1.0%, whereas the internalized fraction
displayed values from 1.3% for 68Ga-16 to
11.3% for 177Lu-14 for the total applied activity.
Normalized to the uptake of ([125I]I-BA)KuE, the results
in Table 1 show that
all carbohydrated compounds exhibited significantly lower values in
comparison to 1 and the 68Ga-labeled compounds
internalized less than the 177Lu-analogs. Differences in
the stereochemistry of 14 and 15 resulted
in slightly higher internalization of the galactose derivative.

Human Serum Albumin Binding
Albumin binding was determined
using a human serum albumin (HSA) column connected to an HPLC system.25,26 Column calibration was always performed prior to the analysis of
the natGa- and natLu-labeled PSMA inhibitors
and resulted in a coefficient of determination (r2) > 92% in all experiments. The results given in Table 1 display a range of
HSA binding from 6.9% for natGa-15 to 78.6%
for natLu-1. Comparing 14 and 15, stereochemistry had only a marginal influence on the albumin-binding
values. Overall, carbohydration reduced the albumin binding in comparison
to the reference ligand 1.

Lipophilicity
For all compounds, the respective 177Lu-labeled analogs
were more lipophilic than the 68Ga-labeled counterparts.
The introduction of a sugar moiety altered
hydrophilicity only to a negligible extent and not significant with 68Ga-14 being the most hydrophilic carbohydrated
PSMA inhibitor displaying a log P value of −4.15
± 0.07. Data for 68Ga- and 177Lu-1 were obtained from a previously published report and are
added in Table 1 for
comparison.27

Metabolic Stability
The in vivo stability of [177Lu]PSMA galactose was investigated
in a healthy mouse 60
min postinjection (p.i.). Figure 3 shows the extracted samples from the urine, blood,
and kidneys, which were analyzed using radio-HPLC. The extraction
rate of 177Lu-14 using 2-PMPA as a competitor
was ≥31% per investigated tissue (≥0.5 MBq) and enabled
sufficient signal intensity. 177Lu-14 was
found to be stable over 60 min in all analyzed fractions.

μPET Imaging and
Biodistribution
68Ga-14 exhibited
lower uptake in non-PSMA-expressing
tissue but also reduced tumor accumulation compared to 68Ga-1 (3.7 ± 0.5% ID/mL vs 5.8 ± 0.3% ID/mL;
85 min p.i.; Figures 4 and 5). The specificity of the PSMA-mediated
tissue uptake of 68Ga-14 in the kidneys and
the xenograft was confirmed by the coinjection of 2-PMPA (8 mg/kg),
which reduced the uptake in these tissues to the background level.

The logarithmic plot
of the time–activity curves (TACs)
in Figure 5 shows a
linear decrease of 68Ga-14 from the heart
and muscle tissue. Direct comparison of 68Ga-1 and 68Ga-14 in the linear TAC in Figure 5 illustrates the
reduced tumor uptake of 68Ga-14 compared to 68Ga-1 (3.7 ± 0.5 vs 5.8 ± 0.3% ID/mL, 68Ga-14 and 68Ga-1, 85
min p.i.). However, it also shows that 68Ga-14 accumulates to a lower extent in the kidneys with an earlier onset
of elimination (43.1 ± 2.2 vs 74.6 ± 3.6% ID/mL, 68Ga-14 and 68Ga-1, 85 min p.i.).

Except for the blood value 1 h p.i., 68Ga-14 showed decreased tissue uptake compared to 68Ga-1 (Figure 6). Reduced accumulation of 68Ga-14 was further
seen in the spleen, kidneys, and tumor (3.86 ± 1.32 vs 4.37 ±
0.64% ID/g uptake in tumor, 68Ga-14 and 68Ga-1, 1 h p.i.). Progressive clearance of 68Ga-14 from the kidneys and other tissues was
visible up to 3 h after injection, whereas tumor uptake remained constant
(3.85 ± 0.54% ID/g, 3 h p.i.).

Discussion
The
recent development of PSMA ligands has resulted in highly specific
radiolabeled agents for radioguided surgery, endoradiotherapy, and
imaging of PCa.6,7,27−31 One of the widespread clinically used compounds is PSMA I&T,
a ligand recently developed by our group.32 Although no significant side effects have been observed so far,
possible adverse reactions due to unwanted uptake of [177Lu]PSMA I&T (1) in the kidneys and salivary glands
might impact the cumulative radioactivity dose, which can be administered
for endoradiotherapy.14

Several investigations
by our group have demonstrated that carbohydration
is a valuable tool to optimize the pharmacokinetics of compounds showing
unfavorable in vivo distribution patterns.17,19,33−37 It was also shown that depending on the utilized
sugar moiety, the adjustment of renal drug handling is feasible.34,38,39 Therefore, in this study, we
have aimed at developing carbohydrated PSMA inhibitors with preserved
bioactivity to investigate the effect of carbohydration on the in
vivo profile of the theranostic tracer PSMA I&T.

The conjugation
of the thioglycosides of galactose and mannose
to the suberic acid linker unit between the binding motif and the
peptidic scaffold surprisingly resulted in slightly higher affinities
than in the parent compound 1 (Table 1) and demonstrated the unexpected tolerability
of PSMA I&T to incorporate bulky hydrophilic moieties in close
proximity to the S1-binding pocket.

These results are, however,
in contrast to a recently published
report by Bouvet et al.40 Their [18F]FDG-based PSMA ligand exhibited only moderate binding to PSMA,
whereas every other compound, modified with an aromatic residue, was
found to have a significantly higher affinity.40 The hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the S1-binding site
of PSMA, which is amenable for π-stacking and π-cationic
interactions with hydrophobic motifs, explains this observation because
no such interactions are possible with a carbohydrate, such as [18F]FDG.41 Yet, PSMA I&T was
developed with the intention to interact in a bidentate mode with
the binding cavity of PSMA and the remote arene-binding site through
the peptidic spacer and, therefore, probably compensates the potentially
negative steric requirement of the sugar moieties. Moreover, the tunnel
region of PSMA was reported to be partially tolerant toward structural
modification,42,43 which might explain the fact
that even the disaccharide analog natLu-16 exhibited a reasonably high affinity (IC50 = 12.5 ±
2.3 nM).

Although lipophilicity was only negligibly affected
and resulted
in log P values ≤ −3.85 for all investigated
compounds, carbohydration had a considerable and significant impact
on tracer internalization. In concordance with previous reports,7,20 the 68Ga-labeled compounds exhibited constantly lower
intracellular activity than the respective 177Lu-labeled
analogs, and notably, the lowest internalization efficiency of only
4.0 ± 0.6% [relative to the reference ([125I]I-BA)KuE]
measured in this study was observed for 68Ga-16. This observation might be explained by either the hexa- or the
heptadentate complexation of gallium and lutetium, respectively, and
thus the resulting additional free carboxylic group in the case of
gallium, which might impede the in vitro interactions, which are necessary
for internalization. A detailed structure–activity relationship
about the mechanism of internalization after ligand binding to PSMA
has not been reported so far. However, the general mechanism has been
shown to rely on endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits.1,44,45 Our data suggest that sterically
demanding carbohydrates at this conjugation side of the molecule affect
the internalization process of PSMA and display a low tolerance for
bulky hydrophilic moieties within the tunnel region. Further, an additionally
negative charge in the chelator region reduces the internalization
rate. These results are in agreement with the findings of Liu et al.,
who stated that the binding of the inhibitor induces a conformational
change in PSMA, which either interferes with or contributes to the
interaction of PSMA’s cytoplasmatic tail with clathrin and
the clathrin adaptor protein-2.46

Analogous to the decreased internalization rate, binding to human
albumin declined significantly. After carbohydration, the value of natGa-14 is more than six times lower compared
to that of natGa-1 (7.7% vs 48.7%; 1 h), and
the same effect was observed for every other tested carbohydrated
derivative in this study (Table 1). It is known that human albumin binds especially
to molecules with lipophilic structures and negative charges in close
proximity. It is therefore reasonable that the carbohydrates interfere
with the interaction of albumin with the otherwise lipophilic suberic
acid structure of the parent ligand PSMA I&T. Because of the positive
results observed by Suzuki et al.34 regarding
the reduction of kidney uptake after conjugation to galactose, ligand 14 was used for further investigation.

Delayed plasma
clearance is especially interesting for possible
therapeutic applications. Increased tracer activity in the blood pool
leads to higher tracer availability and thus increases the probability
of the ligand to bind the target and to be potentially internalized.
This can be achieved, for example, through the introduction of an
albumin-binding tag, as demonstrated for radiolabeled folic acid compounds
and recently for PSMA ligands.47−49 In contrast, low plasma protein
binding might be beneficial in terms of the low background activity
for PET imaging quality with earlier acquisition after intravenous
injection and reduced radiation doses during endoradiotherapy because
radiolabeled PSMA tracers are retained at the target side. A higher
unbound fraction in the blood pool should result in a faster plasma
clearance, if the renal clearance into the bladder is considered as
the primary elimination process.50,51 This situation
was clearly demonstrated in the dynamic μPET imaging and, compared
to [68Ga]PSMA I&T, reduced background activity and
faster plasma clearance of 68Ga-14 were visible
(Figures 5 and 6).

Yet, in contrast to the dynamic PET study,
the biodistribution
study showed an elevated blood activity level for the carbohydrated
compound 68Ga-14 compared to 68Ga-1. A possible explanation, besides the limited number
of PET studies, is the possible metabolite formation. Nevertheless,
no substantial metabolite formation of 177Lu-14 after 60 min p.i. was observed (Figure 3). Hence, the elevated blood uptake of 68Ga-14 has so far not been attributable to a
specific effect but rather explainable through the reduced unspecific
uptake in other tissue compartments, as shown in the biodistribution
study. Except for the blood value at 1 h p.i. (1.53% ID/g vs 0.96%
ID/g, 68Ga-14 vs 68Ga-1, respectively), equal (bone, pancreas) or lower uptake in all other
investigated tissues was visible for 68Ga-14 compared to 68Ga-1 (Figures 7 and 6). Yet, only
the ligand uptake in the lung, spleen, and pancreas is significantly
lower compared to the reference PSMA I&T (P <
0.05). Taking the superior in vitro parameter of nat/177Lu-14 compared to the nat/68Ga-labeled derivative
into account, a biodistribution study with 177Lu-14 should result in a higher tumor uptake because of the higher
affinity and internalization. However, the increased plasma protein
binding would also lead to a higher blood uptake and therefore probably
level out the tumor-to-tissue ratios.

A similar observation
regarding blood uptake was reported by Susaki
et al.39 All carbohydrated vasopressin
derivatives in their study displayed a higher blood level in comparison
to the non-carbohydrated compound. Likewise, they contributed this
effect to decreased unspecific tissue uptake and thus the resulting
elevated plasma levels. Suzuki et al. showed additionally that derivatization
with galactose reduced binding to microsomal kidney and liver fractions.34

Several groups emphasize the importance
of the internalization
to increase the tumor accumulation of PSMA ligands.20,44,52,53 The lower
internalization of 68Ga-14, therefore, probably
caused the slightly reduced tumor uptake compared to 68Ga-1 (3.85 ± 0.54 vs 4.37 ± 0.64% ID/g, 1
h p.i.). In this respect, reduction of the internalization upon carbohydration
may be considered as a drawback, and other carbohydrate moieties should
be evaluated to investigate if distinct glycosides or other positions
within the molecule are able to increase the internalization while
maintaining high affinity. However, recent reports about the superiority
of radiolabeled somatostatin-2 (sst2) antagonists compared
to sst2 agonists and other tracer groups have led to reconsideration
of the importance of the parameter internalization.54−57 It is so far not clear if a “real”
antagonistic PSMA inhibitor without internalization would perform
similarly to the sst2 antagonists. Hence, further studies
regarding the internalization mechanism of PSMA and its importance
are needed.

Conclusions
Carbohydration altered the in vitro properties
of PSMA I&T,
but without significant benefit in vivo. Although high affinity was
maintained, the internalization rate and especially the HSA binding
dropped considerably after the introduction of a carbohydrate moiety.
The derivatives 14, 15, and 16 demonstrate the possibility to conjugate highly hydrophilic bulky
carbohydrates to PSMA I&T-based structures and thus increase the
repertoire of pharmacokinetic modifications for further development
of PSMA ligands, especially for compounds suffering from high lipophilicity.

Radiolabeling
68Ga Labeling
For in

the 68Ga-labeled compounds were prepared using a fully
automated system employing a 68Ge/68Ga generator
(iThemba Labs, South Africa) connected to GallElut+ system (SCINTOMICS

PSMA-positive LNCAP
cells (CLS: 300265;
Cell Lines Service GmbH) were cultivated in Dulbecco modified Eagle
medium/nutrition mixture F-12 (1:1) (DMEM-F12, Biochrom) supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom) and kept at 37 °C in a humidified
5% CO2 atmosphere. One day (24 ± 2 h) prior to all
in vitro experiments with LNCaP cells, the cultivated cells were harvested
using a mixture of trypsin/ethylendiaminetetraacetate (0.05%/0.02%)
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged. After centrifugation,
the supernatant was disposed and the cell pellet was resuspended in
culture medium. Afterward, cells were counted with a hemocytometer
(Neubauer) and seeded in 24-well plates. IC50 values were
determined by transferring 150 000 cells/mL per well into 24-well
plates, whereas internalization was assessed by transferring 125 000
cells/mL into 24-well PLL-coated plates.

Determination of IC50 and Internalization
Detailed information regarding
affinity and internalization experiments
is provided in the Supporting Information.20

Summary
The determination
of binding affinity (IC50) was performed using LNCaP cells
at 4 °C with ([125I]I-BA)KuE as the radioligand and
the respective natGa- and natLu-PSMA inhibitors.
After incubation for 1
h, the cell-bound and free activity were separated and quantified
in a γ-counter. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

For internalization experiments, the 68Ga- and 177Lu-labeled compounds were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C.
Afterward, the experiments were stopped through placing the 24-well
plate on ice for 5 min. After separation of the supernatant (unbound
fraction), the cell-surface-bound activity was removed through incubation
with a 2-PMPA solution for 5 min. Finally, the internalized activity
was gained through lysis with 1.0 M NaOH solution. All fractions were
collected and quantified in a γ-counter, and the uptake was
calculated relative to the uptake of ([125I]I-BA)KuE as
the reference. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

HSA
Binding
HSA binding experiments were performed,
as previously described, by the application of an HSA column connected
to an HPLC system with a UV–vis detector.25 The mobile phase consisted of a binary gradient system
with a constant flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Mobile phase A consisted
of an ammonium acetate solution (50 mM, pH 6.9); mobile phase B was
2-propanol (HPLC grade, VWR, Germany). The gradient of mobile phase
A was 100% from 0 to 3 min and from 3 min to the end of each run;
mobile phase B was set at 20%. On each experimental day, the column
was calibrated with nine reference substances to confirm the performance
and to conduct the nonlinear regression. Afterward, the PSMA inhibitors
with unknown HSA binding were measured. All substances were dissolved
in a 0.5 mg/mL concentration and 5–10 μL was injected
for each run. Further information is provided in the Supporting Information.

Lipophilicity
The log P values were
determined, as previously described, using the shake flask method.20

Statistical analysis was performed for
affinity, internalization, and lipophilicity using a t-test (Microsoft Excel software). All analyses were two-tailed and
considered as type 3 (two-sample unequal variance). A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

In Vivo Experiments
All animal experiments were carried
out in accordance with the general animal welfare regulations in Germany
(Deutsches Tierschutzgesetz, approval #55.2-1-54-2532-71-13). For
the xenograft tumor model, LNCaP cells (approximately 107 cells) were suspended in a serum-free DMEM-F12 medium and Matrigel
(BD Biosciences, Germany) (1:1) and inoculated onto the right shoulder
of 6 to 8 weeks old male CB-17 SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories,
Sulzfeld, Germany). Animals were used for in vivo studies after the
tumor size reached 4–8 mm in diameter.

Metabolic Stability
[177Lu]PSMA galactose
(177Lu-14; 25 MBq) was injected into the tail
vein of a healthy CB-17 SCID mouse (n = 1), which
was sacrificed after 60 min. Samples of the urine and blood were immediately
taken. Kidneys were frozen with liquid nitrogen, homogenized, and
extracted with 2-PMPA solution (500 μL, 400 μM in PBS).
After centrifugation at 15 000g for 5 min,
the suspension was ultrafiltrated and analyzed by radio-HPLC. The
blood sample was centrifuged at 6000g for 5 min to
obtain the plasma. To remove the proteins from the plasma, ice-cold
MeCN was added to the sample, which was later incubated for 10 min
at 4 °C. After concomitant centrifugation and ultrafiltration,
the sample was analyzed by radio-HPLC. The urine sample was used without
any further preparation.

μPET Imaging
Imaging experiments
were conducted
using a Siemens Inveon small-animal PET. The resulting data were analyzed
by the associated Inveon Research Workplace software. Mice were anaesthetized
with isoflurane, and the compounds [68Ga]PSMA I&T (68Ga-1) and [68Ga]PSMA galactose (68Ga-14) (0.2 nmol, 7.0 and 12 MBq, respectively)
were injected via the tail vein (n = 1). Dynamic
imaging was carried out after on-bed injection for 90 min. The static
blockade image was obtained after 1 h p.i. with 15 min acquisition
time. Blockade was performed by coinjection of 8 mg/kg of 2-PMPA.
All images were reconstructed using an OSEM 3D algorithm without scanner
and attenuation correction.

Biodistribution
Approximately 10.0 to 11.0 MBq (ca.
0.2 nmol) of [68Ga]PSMA galactose (68Ga-14) and 6.3–7.0 MBq (ca. 0.2 nmol) of [68Ga]PSMA I&T (68Ga-1) were injected into
the tail vein of LNCaP tumor-bearing male CB-17 SCID mice (n = 4), which were sacrificed after either 1 h p.i. (68Ga-1 and 68Ga-14) or
3 h p.i. (68Ga-14). Selected organs were removed,
weighted, and measured in a γ-counter. Statistical analysis
for the biodistribution study was performed using a t-test (Microsoft Excel software). All analyses were two-tailed and
considered as type 3 (two-sample unequal variance). A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
