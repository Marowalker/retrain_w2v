Solution-processable D−π–A−π–D
structured two organic small molecules bearing thienyl diketopyrrolopyrrole
(TDPP) and furanyl diketopyrrolopyrrole (FDPP) as central acceptor
units and cyano on the π-bridge and phenothiazine as the terminal
donor units, coded as TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN, are designed and synthesized. The C–H arylation and Suzuki
coupling protocols have been adopted for synthesizing the molecules.
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) were constructed with
these molecules as the donors and phenyl-C71-butyric acid
methyl ester as the acceptor yielding power conversion efficiencies
(PCE) of 4.0% for FDPP-PTCN and 5.2% for TDPP-PTCN, which is the highest PCE reported so far from the small molecular
DPP–phenothiazine-based architecture for solution-based OSCs.
The effect of heteroatom substitution on thermal stability and optoelectronic
and photovoltaic performances is also systematically investigated
herein. This work demonstrates that replacement of oxygen with sulfur
in these kinds of small molecules remarkably improves the photovoltaic
performance of OSCs.

1 Introduction
The research related to solution-processed bulk-heterojunction
(BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) comprising narrow band gap polymer
or small molecule as electron donor and fullerene derivative as acceptor
has led to considerable improvement in terms of device performance
in past decades.1−6 When we compare the polymeric donor materials with small molecule
donor, the polymeric donor counterparts have shown better film-forming
features.7 Apart from the morphological
advantage, polymer semiconductors undergo batch-to-batch variations
during synthesis, uncertain synthetic reproducibility, and laborious
purification procedures. In contrast, the small molecules provide
a number of advantages over polymers.8,9 The power conversion
efficiencies (PCEs) up to 10% have recently been achieved from SMD-based solar cells by proper molecular engineering and device optimization.10,11 For high performance of BHJ solar cells, an ideal photoactive donor
molecule should have broad light absorption and enhanced light coupling
with solar spectrum, proper frontier energy levels, high crystallinity
with excellent film morphology, high hole mobility, and good miscibility
with electron acceptors.12−14 Typically, SMDs for organic photovoltaics
(OPVs) are push–pull chromophores where electron donor and
electron acceptor moieties are coupled with each other in conjugated
structures to simultaneously obtain reduced band gaps, which results
in higher short circuit current density (Jsc) and low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels,
which enhances the open-circuit voltage (Voc).15,16 The aforesaid mentioned properties make
small molecules potential donor materials for BHJ solar cell devices.17

Among those outstanding SMDs, dithienosilole
(Si)-, dithienogermole
(Ge)-, and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-derived molecules have been
extensively investigated for solar cell fabrication because of their
excellent photophysical and electrochemical features.18 However, dithienosilole- and dithienogermole-based materials
are highly expensive and involve tedious purification steps. Moreover,
coupling reaction can be performed by Stille coupling method only
for these categories of molecules, whereas all possible coupling protocols
can be adopted to synthesize DPP-based molecules. The DPP-derived
molecules posses several novel properties, like intense light absorption
in the visible region, strong electron-withdrawing nature, high co-planarity,
easy synthetic protocol, photochemical stability, and high charge
carrier mobility.19−26 Because of tunable frontier molecular energy levels, affirmative
optoelectronic properties, and compatibility with both of the fullerene
and non-fullerene electron acceptors, DPP-based molecules served as
promising electron donors.27 DPP moiety
has been also used to design non-fullerene acceptors for photovoltaic
applications.28,29

Recently, solar cells constructed
from SMDs based on D−π–A,
D–A–D, D−π–D, A–D–A,
and D−π–A−π–D types of design
templates with linear, triangular, and cross-shaped geometries have
resulted in promising PCEs.17,30,31 The linear D−π–A−π–D-type
molecular architecture has attracted immense attention as this structure
efficiently reduces the energy band gap of the resultant molecule
and tunes the redox properties via intramolecular charge transfer
(ICT) among the donor and acceptor moieties.13,32 Maglione et al. have designed three DPP-based low band gap SMDs
functionalized with various electron-rich spacers, such as thiophene,
thienothiophene, and thiazole terminated with phenothiazine (PT) rings
in D–A–D pattern, which led to a maximum PCE of 0.7%
in solar cells.33 Jang et al. synthesized
a PT–DPP based molecule with a thiophene spacer, which exhibited
PCEs up to 1.8%.34 In 2013, Zhang et al.
reported SMDs in A–D–A template consisting of DPP as
an electron-accepting moiety (A) and PT as an electron-donating group
(D), which yielded a PCE of 0.75%.35 The
same group subsequently reported a D−π–A−π–D-type
SMD consisting of DPP as the electron-withdrawing group, triphenylamine
as the electron-donating moiety, and acrylonitrile as π-linkages,
which exhibited PCE of 2.9% with relatively higher open-circuit voltage
(Voc).36 An
NIR absorbing D−π–A−π–D structured
DPP-based SMD, coded as DPP–DTF, yielded a PCE of 4.3% in BHJ
solar cells.13 An efficiency of 2.2% was
obtained from single-component OSC using a DPP-based organic dyad.14 A 1D supramolecular assembly organic gel has
also been reported, which was used as an additive in poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl})-based OSC and a high PCE of 7.9% was achieved.37 Some representative DPP-based donor molecules
are demonstrated with their respective PCEs in Figure 1.32,36,38

Figure 1 Structures
of small molecule donors used in this work along with
some representative donor molecules.

Incorporation of atoms with high electron affinity, such
as fluorine
on the D–A conjugated backbone, or a good electron-withdrawing
group such as cyano at their vinylic linkage may effectively stabilize
the energy levels and simultaneously decrease the HOMO level of the
resultant molecule, which in turn helps in obtaining high Voc in OPV devices. It is seen that isoelectronic
substitution or systematic replacement of heteroatom in the aromatic
heterocycle of electron donor not only modulates the electron-donating
capacity of the donor molecule, but also potentially enhances its
optoelectronic properties, such as optical absorption and charge carrier
mobility, which in turn favorably influence the OPV device performance.39,40 Moreover, the thiophene-containing DPP-based conjugated molecules
have attracted more attention compared to the furan-containing DPP
materials in the area of photonic devices in spite of having matching
energy levels and approximate degree of aromaticity of both of the
candidates.41

In this paper, we have
synthesized two new low band gap SMDs by
C–H activation and Suzuki coupling, coded as TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN, with D−π–A−π–D
molecular template composed of thienyl diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP)
and furanyl diketopyrrolopyrrole (FDPP) as central acceptor units
and cyano on the π-bridge and PT as the terminal electron donor
unit for application in BHJ solar cells (Figure 1, Scheme 1). C–H activation is a simple and effective
tool to obtain targeted molecules avoiding several severe critical
reaction conditions and allows to access energy-efficient and economy
products. The reasons for choosing PT as terminal moiety are attributed
to their excellent electron-donating nature and good charge transportation
properties.42 Four 2-ethylhexyl branched
alkyl groups were attached to the molecular backbone to ensure the
solubility in common organic solvents for solution process technique.
These small molecules displayed longer absorption wavelengths with
suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels with phenyl-C71-butyric
acid methyl ester (PC71BM) to build blends well organized
for attaining a high PCE. Although DPP and PT both are regarded as
excellent units to design photoactive materials, the highest reported
PCE of the OSCs made from DPP–PT unit based SMDs is still below
1%.35 In this work, the newly invented
SMDs, TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN, show PCEs
of 5.2 and 4.0%, respectively, when blended with PC71BM
in solar cells. The cross-sectional structure of solar cell device
is shown in Figure 2 along with the energy band diagram. These findings strongly suggest
that the adopted molecular design strategy as discussed here is a
constructive method to improve the PCE of DPP–PT based OSCs.
It further confirms that the band gap can be fine-tuned by introducing
cyano on the π-bridge and varying the heteroatom within the
same group of the periodic table.

level diagram of TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 UV–Visible
Absorption
The
UV-absorption spectra of both TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN molecules in solution and in thin films are presented in Figure 3. The resultant optoelectronic
data are displayed in Table 1. In solution state, TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN showed different absorption bands with similar absorption spectra,
the maximum absorption (λmax) at 619 nm (ε
= 64 489 M–1 cm–1) and
626 nm (ε = 82 676 M–1 cm–1) with the absorption onset (λon) at 667 and 655
nm, respectively, which derives from ICT among the donor and acceptor
moieties. In thin film state, the absorption spectra of TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN were somewhat broadened and red shifted
nearly in between 25 and 35 nm (λmax and λon are 659 and 648 nm and 726 and 700 nm, respectively) compared
to the solution phase, demonstrating that both small molecules, TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN, are aggregated effectively
in the solid state owing to strong intermolecular π–π
interaction obtained from the greatly conjugated backbone structure.
The λon at 726 and 700 nm in thin films is proportionate
to an optical band gap of 1.70 and 1.77 eV for TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN, respectively. We have also recorded
that absorption spectra for the blends with 1:1 and 1:3 ratios of
donors and PC71BM, respectively (Figures S1 and S2), are red shifted and covering from 300 to 900 nm. TDPP-PTCN shows a different vibronic peak at the extended
wavelength close to the absorption edge compared with FDPP-PTCN molecule. This indicates the presence of some well-ordered structure
and strong molecular stacking in the film.

2.2 Electrochemical Properties
The HOMO
and LUMO properties of two new molecules were estimated using cyclic
voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques.
These experiments were performed at room temperature in DCM solutions
of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as an electrolyte, Pt wire
as the counter electrode, Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode,
and ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an external
standard. The CV and DPV plots of TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN are personated in Figure 4 and the corresponding data are summarized
in Table 2.

solution.

New Small Molecule Donorsa
donors	Eox (V)	Ered (V)	E0–0 (eV)	HOMO (eV)	LUMO (eV)	
TDPP-PTCN	0.12	–1.79	1.91	–5.25	–3.34	
FDPP-PTCN	0.16	–1.83	1.99	–5.29	–3.39	
a The HOMO and LUMO values were calculated
by using the chemical formula HOMO = −(Eox + 5.13) eV and LUMO = −(Ered + 5.13) eV, where Eox and Ered values were taken from oxidation and reduction peaks,
respectively.43

From the CV we have estimated the HOMO and LUMO energy
levels of TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN, which
were obtained
as −5.25, −5.29 and −3.34, −3.39 eV, respectively.
The electrochemical band gaps of TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN were 1.91 and 1.99 eV, respectively. Both dyes exhibit
two broad oxidation waves and one reduction wave. The reduction wave
at −1.78 and −1.82 V corresponding to the DPP core was
observed in TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN, respectively.
Both TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN molecules show
two oxidation waves observed at 0.52, 0.12 V and 0.46 , 0.16 V respectively,
first because of the oxidation of terminal PT and the other because
of the oxidation of thiophene/furan near the DPP core. The energetically
favorable frontier energy levels of both the SMDs and PC71BM acceptor provide sufficient driving force for smooth exciton dissociation
and successful electron transfer in the blend. Generally in BHJ OSCs
the deeper HOMO level of synthesized donors was advantageous for high Voc, when used as the donor along with PC71BM as an electron acceptor.

2.3 Thermal
Properties
The thermal stability
of the TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN molecules
was explored by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and their plots
are shown in Figure 5. When the temperature was raised from room temperature to 800 °C
under nitrogen atmosphere, we can notice from the TGA graph that both
of the compounds showed decent thermal stability up to 395 °C.

Figure 5 TGA of TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN measured
at 10 °C min–1 under inert atmosphere.

2.4 Photoluminescence
(PL) Measurement
In order to scrutinize the charge separation
phenomena and photoinduced
electron transfer among the TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN donors with PC71BM acceptor, PL quenching was performed
in o-dichlorobenzene solution with increasing content
of PC71BM. Figure 6 shows the PL spectra for the pristine SMDs, TDPP-PTCN:PC71BM, and FDPP-PTCN:PC71BM
blend solutions by varying the weight ratios of donor–acceptor
starting from 1:0 to 1:4. When the concentration of PC71BM is gradually increased, the intensity of PL peaks at 663 and 654
nm for TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN, respectively,
dramatically decreases, which reflects an efficient photoinduced charge
separation process in between the donor materials with acceptor PC71BM.38,44 The Stern–Volmer coefficient
(Ksv) was calculated from the linearly
fitted slope of ηo/η versus c plot, where ηo and η are the emission efficiency
in the absence and presence of the quencher, that is, PC71BM, and c is the quencher concentration. The molecular
weights of TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN are taken
as 1396.65 and 1365.89 g/mol, respectively. The values of Ksv are estimated to be 4.1 × 105 and 3.6 × 105 M–1. As per the
literature, the higher value of Ksv is
a sign of efficient charge transfer from donor to acceptor.45Figure S3 shows the
PL spectra of TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN with
different ratios of PC71BM, which indicate excellent quenching
characteristics.

2.5 Photovoltaic Performance
To study
the photovoltaic performance of newly developed SMDs, viz. TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN, devices were constructed using PC71BM as the acceptor material in traditional device architecture
of ITO/MoOx (∼10 nm)/SMDs:PC71BM (∼130 nm)/Al (∼100 nm). The device fabrication
process of OSCs is described in the Experimental
Section. Figure 7 represents the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices measured under
AM 1.5 G illuminations, that is, 100 mW cm–2, and
the corresponding photovoltaic results are displayed in Table 3. The optimized OSC device tells
that the blend ratio 1:3 of TDPP-PTCN:PC71BM exhibits the highest performance, with a PCE of 5.2%, Voc of 0.80 V, Jsc of 10.46 mA cm–2, and FF of 0.62, whereas FDPP-PTCN:PC71BM shows the best device performance,
with a PCE of 4.0%, Voc of 0.79 V, Jsc of 9.42 mA cm–2, and FF
of 0.53. As per our knowledge, the PCE of 5.2% is the highest value
reported so far from the DPP—PT based systems for SMD OSCs
using solution process technique. By varying the blend ratio from
1:1 to 1:3, Jsc and FF increase; however, Voc remains almost constant. Both SMDs shows
the high value of Voc (∼0.8 V)
because of the deep HOMO energy levels. We anticipate that further
device optimization and film morphology will greatly enhance the device
performance.7b

2.6 Spectral Response of Solar Cells
To understand the process of photon-to-electron conversion, the corresponding
EQEs of the devices at various wavelengths were measured after illuminating
the device area with a monochromatic light source. Figure 8 shows the EQE curves of the
newly synthesized SMDs:PC71BM blend ratio of 1:3. As seen
from the graph, the FDPP-PTCN:PC71BM-based
device exhibits an effective photoconversion efficiency covering the
wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm. On the other hand, the EQE value
of TDPP-PTCN:PC71BM blends reaches up to 44%
and it observes a broader spectral response than the former one extending
up to 900 nm, which contributed to a higher Jsc value in these devices. The values of Jsc calculated by integrating the EQE spectra coupling
with solar spectrum of AM1.5G are 10.61 and 9.34 mA cm–2 for TDPP-PTCN:PC71BM- and FDPP-PTCN:PC71BM-based OSCs, respectively, and closely resemble
the measured values within ±2% error. As per the above results,
we also concluded that replacing the furan with a thiophene from central
DPP core can expressively progress the photoconversion efficiency
and broaden the response range.

from SMDs:PC71BM with 1:3 ratio.

2.7 Surface Topology
The nanoscale surface
topology of the photoactive blend films was visualized with atomic
force microscopy in tapping mode on a scanning area of 2 μm
× 2 μm. The TDPP-PTCN:PC71BM and FDPP-PTCN:PC71BM based blend films showed very
smooth surface with root mean square (rms) roughness of only 2.84
± 0.34 and 3.28 ± 0.51 nm, respectively (Figure 9). The lower rms value of film
roughness improves the metal–semiconductor contact, which is
advantageous for exciton dissociation and charge collection. Hence, TDPP-PTCN:PC71BM-based OSC is expected to perform
better, which is reflected in our photovoltaic results, as shown in Table 3.

3 Conclusions
In summary, two D−π–A−π–D
architecture functional small molecules TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN have been designed and synthesized by C–H
activation and Suzuki coupling reaction for application in small molecule–based
OSCs. These materials have suitable photonic properties, such as near-IR
and wide-ranging light absorption in the visible region and suitable
FMO levels as electron donors to construct solar cell devices with
popular electron acceptor PC71BM. Both of the molecules
have good thermal stability up to 395 °C as confirmed by TGA.
The new donor molecules possess excellent electron-donating capability
as confirmed by PL quenching experiments. The Ksv values are found to be 4.1 × 105 and 3.6
× 105 M–1 for TDPP-PTCN:PC71BM and FDPP-PTCN:PC71BM blends,
respectively. The OSCs fabricated from TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN with PC71BM exhibited the highest PCEs
of 5.2 and 4.0%, respectively. This is the highest PCE reported till
date in the DPP–PT-based systems from solution-processed small
molecular OSCs. This study demonstrated that PT is a potential electron-donating
unit in combination with DPP to make efficient conjugated small molecular
donor for solar cell application. This study also reveals that changing
the heteroatom substitution of the DPP moiety and employment of cyano
group on the π-spacer in the D−π–A−π–D
type SMDs can remarkably improve the photovoltaic properties.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis and Characterization
The
synthetic procedures for both TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN small molecules are represented in Scheme S1 (Supporting Information). The Knoevenagel condensation reaction
of 10-(2-ethylhexyl)-10H-phenothiazine-3-carbaldehyde
and 4-bromobenzyl cyanide was performed using sodium ethoxide as a
base in an ethanol solvent, resulting in compound 3 with a yield of
92%. The Miyaura borylation reaction was carried out using bis (pinacolato)
diboron (B2Pin2), KOAc, and Pd(dppf)Cl2 in dry 1,4 dioxane, resulting in compound 4 with very good yield.
Further, the target molecules TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN were synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reaction in high yields
of 81 and 74%, respectively, and by C–H activation (Scheme 1). Both TDPP-PTCN and FDPP-PTCN molecules were fully characterized by
the 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI–TOFMS
(see Supporting Information). These molecules
are highly soluble in most of the organic solvents, such as chloroform,
dichlorobenzene, and so on because of alkyl chains.

in 45 mL degassed tetrahydrofuran and 3 mL of 2 M Na2CO3 solution; then the solution was again degassed with N2 gas for 15 min, then Pd(PPh3)4 (28.8
mg, 0.025 mmol) was added, and refluxed for 12 h under inert atmosphere
of nitrogen. After cooling down to room temperature, solvents were
removed under reduced pressure and extracted with DCM, dried over
Na2SO4. The extracted solvent was removed by
rotary evaporation and the crude product was precipitated in methanol
and then sonicated for 10 min and filtered through Buchner funnel.
Finally, it was washed with excess of methanol and acetonitrile to
remove the impurities and purified by column chromatography using
silica gel, eluting with dichloromethane and hexane to afford the

4.2 Material Characterization
A Shimadzu
UV-1800 spectrometer was used for UV–vis absorption spectrum.
All solution-state UV–vis experiments were performed in CHCl3. Thin films were prepared by spin coating by using CHCl3 solution onto glass. For an electrochemical measurement,
we performed CV on a CH instrument using three electrodes. The redox
potentials of the SMDs were calculated in CH2Cl2 containing 0.1 M Bu4NClO4 as an electrolyte.

4.3 Device Fabrication
Both the donor
compounds and PC71BM were dissolved in chlorobenzene in
different donor–acceptor ratios (1:1 to 1:4) to prepare the
blend solution. 1,8-Diodooctane was used as an additive to improve
the solubility of the molecules further. The donor concentration was
kept at 10 mg mL–1. The solution was kept on magnetic
stirrer overnight at 60 °C inside a glove box. ITO glass substrate
was thoroughly cleaned with multiple solvents, such as deionized water,
isopropanol, and acetone followed by ultra-sonication for 60 min.
Subsequently, ITO substrates were exposed to ultraviolet ozone irradiation
for 15 min to improve surface properties. First, a layer of molybdenum
oxide (MoOx) with targeted thickness of
10 nm was deposited by thermal evaporation at a chamber pressure below
10–7 Torr. The device active layers were then spin-casted
at 1500 rpm for 1 min in a glove box. Finally, 100 nm thick Al was
deposited to form the cathode. After completion of device fabrication,
substrates were encapsulated using epoxy.

4.4 Device
Characterization
The light
current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were recorded with
a Keithley 236 source meter unit under simulated AM 1.5G irradiance
of intensity 100 mW cm–2. The solar simulator was
standardized with an NREL-certified reference cell. During electrical
characterization of solar cells, a cover plate with an aperture of
10 mm2 area was used to define active device area accurately.
The spectral response of the devices was characterized by PV Measurement,
Inc. system.
