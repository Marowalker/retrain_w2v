Herein, we present an optimized bottom-up
approach to fabricate
homogeneous Au nanostars with plasmon resonances fully tunable between
the red and the infrared. The synthetic method relies on the kinetic
control of the reaction upon optimization of the reactant concentrations
(i.e., gold seeds, reducing agent, and gold salt). Optical enhancing
properties of the obtained materials are demonstrated by using SERS
with visible and infrared lasers.

Introduction
Plasmonic particles
have many applications in catalysis,1 nonlinear
optics,2 enhanced spectroscopy (i.e., SERS,
MEF, and SEIRA),3 biology,4 and medicine,5 because of their
ability to generate strong electromagnetic
fields at their surface upon excitation with the appropriate light.
Both the energy and intensity of these fields, also denoted as localized
surface plasmon resonances (LSPR), depend strongly on the material,
the size, and especially the morphology of the particle.6

Among different morphologies, spiked
particles such as nanostars
(NSt), consisting of spherical cores with protruding sharp tips, are
among the most efficient plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs). In these NPs,
the LSPR is highly confined at the tip of the spike, whereas the core
acts as an electron reservoir.7 In fact,
these NPs are among the very few morphologies that allow for single
particle spectroscopy.7b,8 Notwithstanding, the characteristic
plasmonic response of spiked NPs begins at the near-infrared (NIR),
and although this response can be proficiently exploited for applications
such as detection in cells and tissues,9 light-triggered drug delivery,10 or photothermal
therapies,11 it inhibits the applicability
of these materials under visible light.

It is already established
that, during the synthesis of gold nanostars
(AuNSt), the spikes are produced because of a preferential growth
of the twin boundaries of spherical seeds with a well-defined multitwined
crystallographic structure. In fact, these regions are the most reactive
areas at the seed surface.12 Consequently,
during the growth process, each twin boundary starts growing and develops
a spike that generates new twin boundaries. This process results in
the growth of more spikes, leading to multispiked structures.12c,13 Besides the use of different seeds, the control over the reduction
kinetics and the selective facet reduction are the two key aspects
that influence the NSt morphology. Both factors are correlated and
influenced mainly by four variables: the temperature, the solvent,
the reducing agent, and the reaction time.12c Generally, the temperature plays a crucial role by accelerating
or slowing down the reduction kinetics as it is raised or decreased.14 However, for temperatures below 60 °C,
there is no appreciable effect on the shape or optical properties
of the AuNSt.13b On the other hand, the
classical approach for preparing AuNSt is achieved by the reduction
of gold ions using poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)13b in N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF).15 In this synthesis, DMF not only
acts as the solvent but also plays an important role in improving
the reduction capacity of PVP via an increase of the polymer solubility.7c Notably, the replacement of DMF by another less
polar solvent, such as ethanol, slows the reaction rate by reducing
the PVP solubility.12c

Herein, we
present an optimized bottom-up approach to fabricate
highly homogeneous AuNSt, with tunable LSPR response, by controlling
the amount of reactants (i.e., gold seeds, reducing agent, and gold
salt) and the reaction time. This synthesis enables the precise control
over the tip reshaping which, in turn, allows for the fine tuning
of the LSPR energy from the infrared to red. Further, to demonstrate
the effect of the LSPR tunability on the optical enhancing properties
of the stars, SERS intensities of the different materials are also
characterized with visible and NIR lasers using a model analyte.

Results
and Discussion
Influence of the Seed Concentration on the
Plasmon Tunability
The classical method for AuNSt fabrication
designed by Liz-Marzan’s
group7c relies on the use of gold seeds
with well-defined crystallinity (crystal facets formed by {111} planes)
that are transferred to ethanol using PVP as the stabilizer.16 Then, the star-shaped NPs are obtained by adding
the seeds to a solution containing PVP, DMF, and a gold salt (i.e.,
HAuCl4). This process is a seed-mediated approach, and
therefore, our first attempts to tune the LSPR of AuNSt were focused
on varying the amount of seeds added to the growth solution, as typically
reported for similar processes.17 As expected,
a systematic variation of the amount of seeds allows for the tuning
of the LSPR. However, as shown in Figure 1, such tunability is limited to a very restricted
spectral range (approximately 700–900 nm). Moreover, a further
increase in the amount of seeds to achieve larger blue-shifts leads
to the formation of spheroidal particles. Thus, using this approach,
the production of NSt with optical properties within the visible range
is hampered.

Figure 1 (A) Normalized UV–vis spectra of a set of synthesis,
using
the traditional DMF/PVP seed-mediated approach, where AuNSt are produced
by varying systematically the amount of spherical seeds added to the
solution. The spectrum highlighted in blue corresponds to the particles
obtained via the standard protocol. (B) TEM images for the particles
of the spectra shown in (A). Scale bar = 100 nm.

As an alternative to overcome this limitation, preformed
AuNSt
can be used as seeds and subsequently overgrown. In this strategy,
previously reported for nanorods,15,18 the {111}
facets of Au nanorods are selectively grown using PVP. Consequently,
the formed rods are thicker, while still maintaining sharp tips, and
the LSPR shifts to the blue. Therefore, the first step to produce
tunable AuNSt was the synthesis of highly homogenous AuNSt seeds by
the classical PVP/DMF seed-mediated approach as previously described.7c This protocol usually yields AuNSt with a maximum
plasmon contribution around 750 nm. Nonetheless, in our experiments,
we choose to produce AuNSt with LSPR around 850 nm to demonstrate
the excellent tunability, from the NIR to the visible range, provided
by the method.

Influence of the PVP Concentration on the
Plasmon Tunability
Besides stabilizing the NPs, PVP also
acts as a reducing agent.
Therefore, different concentrations of PVP, using ethanol as the solvent
to slow the reaction rate,12c were investigated
to optimize the best conditions while all other parameters (volume,
[AuNStseed], and [HAuCl4]) were maintained constant.
The [HAuCl4]/[AuNStseed] ratio (R1) is critical to effectively modify the morphology and,
thus, the optical properties of particles.18 Thus, as previously discussed for the preparation of thick nanorods,
a low concentration ratio of gold salt to seeds was selected
as the starting point (R1 = 1.7). Then,
the concentration of PVP was varied in relation to a fixed concentration
of gold salt (8.57 × 10–5 M), according to
the [HAuCl4]/[PVP] ratio (R2) in the 0.1 to 1.5 range.

Figure 2A shows some examples of the variation of
the LSPR profile with time for reactions with different R2. The degree of the blue-shift as a function of time,
for each reaction (R2 from 0.1 to 1.5),
is presented in Figure 2B. Although plasmonic shift cannot be considered a direct measurement
of the growth kinetics of NPs, it is directly related to the shape
transformation. A simple examination of the temporal response of the
LSPR reveals a Langmuir shape (exponential rise to the maximum value),
which indicates first-order kinetics. Following the Prout–Tompkins
model19 1  which when integrated and
rearranged 2  where θ is the conversion
fraction, t is the time of reaction, and k is the conversion-fraction-dependent rate constant. Assuming
the conversion factor is Δλ/Δλ0, eq 2 can be rewritten
as 3  and directly used to fit the
kinetic data. The blue-shift, expressed as Δλmax, and the variation of k with R2 are presented in Figure 2C,D, respectively. These results reveal that, although
for a fixed concentration of gold salt all reactions display LSPR
blue-shifts with time, its overall variation increases with R2. This indicates that larger PVP concentrations
promote shape stabilization as previously reported.20 On the other hand, [PVP] also affects the transformation
kinetics. As it can be observed, the transformation kinetics is faster
as R2 decreases (Figure 2D). However, it is interesting to point out
that, for all R2 values, the transformation
kinetics is slow, ranging from 100 h for R2 = 1.5 to 150 h for R2 = 0.1. Thus, with
the aim of increasing both the reaction rate and the LSPR tunability,
the effect of [HAuCl4] at fixed [PVP] was also investigated.
To this end, a R2 of 0.2 ([PVP] =
4 × 10–4 M) was defined. This value is around
20 times smaller than the conventional amount7c and was selected because, although it does not promote the larger
blue-shift or reaction rate, it still provides full colloidal stability
to the AuNSt in solution.

overgrowth process

(D) kinetic constant with R2.

Influence of the HAuCl4 Concentration on
the Plasmon Tunability
The [HAuCl4]/[AuNStseed] ratio (R1) usually influences
the final particle size and therefore strongly affects the optical
response of the final structures. For example, for elongated particles,
a sequential increase in R1 yields thicker
nanorods that may finally be transformed into octahedrons.15,18Figure 3A shows examples
of several reactions where R1 was varied
at fixed AuNStseed and PVP concentrations. The extent of
the blue-shift as a function of time for each reaction (i.e., for R1 from 0.1 to 1.5) is illustrated in Figure 3B. Analogous to the
kinetic curves obtained by varying R2,
those presented here show a Langmuir-shaped profile and, thus, were
fitted with eq 3. Notably,
the total blue-shift dramatically increases with R1, that is, with [HAuCl4], reaching LSPR below
600 nm for the largest gold salt concentration (Figure 3C). Surprisingly, the reaction rate severely
decreases with R1. The blue line (Figure 3D) shows an exponential
decay of the reaction rate as more gold salt is added to the reaction
until stabilization is reached for R1 values
above 0.3 (purple line). Notably, for low values of R1 (0.1 and 0.2), the gold salt is fully consumed
before higher blue-shifts can be achieved. For values between 0.3
and 1.5, the kinetic constant remains very similar. This fact is in
contrast to the increase of this parameter as a function of R2 (Figure 2D). When [PVP] is raised, at fixed gold salt and AuNStseed concentrations, the reaction rate decreases because the
polymer tends to wrap the NPs, making the interaction of the gold
ions with the metallic surface more difficult. On the other hand,
the formation of complex species between Au(III) and PVP is well-known,21 promoting the stabilization of the ions in solution.
Differently, when [HAuCl4] is increased, at low PVP and
seeds concentrations, the kinetic constant remains steady due
to the low amount of polymer on the particle surfaces, which slows
the epitaxial reduction process of the particle (PVP also acts as
the reducing agent).

process
at low, optimal, and high R1. (B) Transformation
kinetics at different R1 at fixed concentrations
of AuNStseed and PVP. Variation of the (C) maximum blue-shift
and the (D) kinetic constant, obtained by fitting eq 3 to the data, with R2.

On the other hand, the
UV–vis spectra reveal a gradual increment
of the LSPR intensity when R1 is increased
from 0.1 to 0.6 (Figure 3A and Figure S1). Above this value of R1, the LSPR intensity drops. Thus, for the efficient
modulation of LSPR, [HAuCl4] should be relatively low to
avoid fast reduction kinetics but high enough to enable LSPR tuning.

Effect of the Reaction Time on the Plasmon Tunability
The
above results make it clear that the LSPR can be appropriately
tuned by the thermodynamic control of the reaction. However, this
control requires careful readjustment of the reactant concentrations,
which may considerably decrease the reaction rate. Alternatively,
the kinetic control of the reaction can provide AuNSt at the desired
LSPR (below 600 nm) with increased intensity and narrower plasmonic
bands. This is clearly displayed in Figure 4. Here, NSt were overgrown under optimized
conditions (R1 = 0.6 and R2 = 0.2, where [AuNSt] = 1.24 × 10–4 M, [PVP] = 4 × 10–4 M, and [HAuCl4] = 8 × 10–5 M). Aliquots of the colloids
were sampled over time and mixed with a large amount of PVP to quench
the reaction. UV–vis spectra and TEM and optical images of
each aliquot were then acquired. The results show that the LSPR position
can be kinetically controlled (Figure 4A) and finely tuned in the very broad 570–870
nm spectral range. Notably, LSPRs display narrower features with intensities
higher than the initial AuNSt seeds (in some cases, more than 50%
larger). On the other hand, TEM images exhibit AuNSt with well-defined
tips (Figure 4B and Figures S2 and S3).

TEM images corresponding to the highlighted spectra shown in (A).

images of the obtained solutions of AuNSt.

Origin of the Plasmon Tunability
To gain further understanding
on the origin of such outstanding plasmon tunability, a detailed morphological
characterization of the colloidal materials was performed. To this
end, the structure of more than 100 AuNSt from each of the samples
shown in Figure 4 and Figures S2 and S3 was examined in terms of (i)
tip length, (ii) tip thickness, (iii) tip angle, and (iv) core diameter.
Their corresponding histograms are shown in Figures S4–S7. These morphologic parameters together with their
LSPR maximum for all samples are presented in Figure 5. Notably, the factor that
influences the most the plasmon position is the tip angle, as previously
predicted in the literature,7a,7b with the tip length,
core diameter, and tip thickness as minor contributors.

parameters (tip length, tip thickness, tip angle, and
core diameter) of the prepared AuNSt as a function of their maximum
LSPR response.

Optical Enhancing Properties
of the Tunable NSt
To
test the effect of the plasmon tuning on the optical enhancement properties
of the prepared NSt, benzenethiol (BT) was used as an optical probe.
Diluted samples of AuNSt (10–4 M in gold) containing
a BT concentration of 10–6 M were explored with
a macrosampling accessory using two laser lines, 633 and 785 nm. All
the samples yielded the characteristic SERS spectra of BT for both
lasers (Figure 6A).
However, the intensity provided by each sample excited with the different
laser lines was very different (Figure 6B). For the NIR laser (785 nm), maximum intensities
were provided by NSt with a plasmon centered at 795 nm. Then, intensity
abruptly decayed, both for red- and blue-shifts. Conversely, for the
red line (633 nm), maximum intensity was provided by the NSt with
the plasmon located at 657 nm. Following a similar trend to that observed
for the infrared laser, the enhancement of the AuNSt decreased significantly
for NSt, with plasmons shifted both to higher and lower wavelengths.
Both excitation lines provide maximum SERS intensities when the LSPRs
are centered slightly to the red of the excitation line, with a subsequent
decrease in the intensity as the electromagnetic coupling between
the LSPR and the excitation line also decreases.22 Thus, the trend of plasmon correlation with excitation
frequency is strictly followed in full agreement with previously reported
results for plasmon-sampled SERS.23

respectively. (B) Variation for both excitation lines of the SERS

Conclusions
In
summary, we show the possibility of tuning the optical response
of spiked NPs from the NIR to the visible range, while retaining a high
plasmon efficiency. Plasmon tunability arises from the kinetic control
during a seed-mediated process, where the seeds are standard NSt.
Through the careful control of the reactant concentrations and the
appropriate quenching of the reaction at the desired time, it is possible
to finely control the plasmon position of the AuNSt. Optical characterization
through plasmon-sampled SERS indicates full correlation between the
SERS intensity, the laser line, and the plasmon position. Finally,
the fine control of the LSPR position of these interesting particles
may broaden the applicability of NSt in many fields, such as plasmonic
catalysis, nonlinear optics, enhanced spectroscopy, biology, and medicine.

Methods
Materials
PVP (MW = 25000) was purchased from Roth.
Gold(III) chloride trihydrate (99.9%, HAuCl4·3H2O), trisodium citrate dihydrate (≥99.5%, C6H5Na3O7·2H2O), and
absolute ethanol (≥99.9%, EtOH), were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
DMF (≥99%) was acquired from Fluka. All reactants were used
without further purification. Milli-Q water (18 MΩ cm–1) was used in all aqueous solutions, and all the glassware was cleaned
with aqua regia before the experiments. SERS experiments were carried
out on a Renishaw Raman inVia System using a macrolens collector and
two laser lines (633 and 785 nm).

Synthesis of Spherical
Gold Seeds
Spherical multitwined
gold NPs of approximately 12 nm in diameter were produced by a modification
of the well-known Turkevich method.24 Briefly,
the Au particles were prepared by boiling 500 mL of Milli-Q water
using a condenser to prevent solvent evaporation. Next, 11 mL of sodium
citrate (0.1 M) was added (final citrate concentration was 2.2 mM)
under vigorous stirring. After 10 min, a HAuCl4 aqueous
solution (833.0 μL, 0.1 M) was added, and the mixture was allowed
to react for 30 min under continuous boiling and stirring. During
this time, the color of the solution gradually changed from colorless
to purple to finally become deep red. The final Au concentration was
1.6 × 10–4 M.

Transfer and Concentration
of the Spherical Gold Seeds
After cooling, the produced Au
seed particles were transferred to
ethanol using PVP as a phase transfer agent.16b Concretely, the gold NPs (500 mL) were added drop by drop under
vigorous stirring to a previously sonicated (30 min) aqueous PVP solution
(500 mL, 0.27 mM). To guarantee that PVP adsorption on the gold NP
surface was complete, the reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at
room temperature. To transfer the PVP-stabilized particles into ethanol,
the volume of the solution was firstly reduced using a Rotavapor for
1 h at 60 °C and 90 mbar, until a total volume of approximately
250 mL was left. Finally, the Au seeds were centrifuged twice (9000
rpm, 45 min), the supernatant was discarded, and the particles were
dispersed in 40 mL of EtOH to achieve a final Au concentration of
16.2 × 10–4 M.

Synthesis of AuNSt and
Tuning the λmax by Varying
the Amount of Spherical Au Seeds
AuNSt were prepared following
a modification of the standard PVP/DMF approach.2,7c,25 Eight different flasks were prepared by
dissolving 1g of PVP in 5 mL of DMF; after its complete dissolution,
the mixtures were further sonicated for 30 min to assure homogeneity
of the polymer in the solution. Next, an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (17.25 μL, 0.0997 M) was added to each bottle under
vigorous stirring at room temperature. Immediately after, different
volumes of the PVP-coated Au seeds in ethanol ([Au0] =
16.2 × 10–4 M) were rapidly added (5, 10, 20
30, 40, 60, 70, 100, and 150 μL) to the solutions. Within 15
min, the color of the solutions changed from pink to blue, indicating
the formation of AuNSt. The solutions were left under stirring overnight
to assure the reduction of all reactants. The AuNSt were cleaned via
centrifugation (7500 rpm, 40 min) and resuspended in 5 mL of EtOH.
Note that the amount of seeds used for the standard NSt synthesis
corresponds to 40 μL.

Synthesis of AuNSt Seeds
AuNSt were
produced in the
same way as previously stated, but in this case, a total volume of
60 mL was prepared. To do this, 12 g of PVP was dissolved in 60 mL
of DMF; after its complete dissolution, the mixture was further sonicated
for 30 min. Next, an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (207 μL,
0.0997 M) was added under vigorous stirring at room temperature. Immediately
after, 400 μL of the Au seeds in ethanol ([Au0] =
16.2 × 10–4 M) was rapidly added, and the solution
was left under stirring overnight. The AuNSt were cleaned by two centrifugation
steps, first at 7500 rpm for 40 min and second at 7000 rpm for 10
min; in both steps, the particles were resuspended in 60 mL of EtOH.
This solution was kept to further use them as NSt seeds. The obtained
AuNSt exhibit a maximum absorbance peak around 850 nm and a final
Au concentration of 1.93 × 10–4 M.

Determination
of [PVP] in Solution
It is important
to note that, because the standard synthesis of AuNSt requires the
use of a large excess of PVP, the appropriate cleaning of the NPs
to be used as seeds is of paramount importance. For example, Figure S8 shows the LSPR variation for the three
reactions following exactly the same synthetic protocol but with AuNSt
at different cleaning levels. When the particles were used without
cleaning, no LSPR shift was observed (Figure S8A). Further, even when the same cleaning protocol was followed (three
cycles of centrifugation), severe disagreement was found within the
LSPR blue-shift (Figure S8B,C), revealing
that the PVP concentration was different for each sample even when
the performed cleaning procedure has been apparently the same.
Therefore, to ensure equal PVP concentration, the AuNSt were cleaned
seven times, redispersing each of the centrifuged particles in a solution
with well-defined PVP content. In this way, it is possible to know
the PVP concentration of each solution without affecting the NP stability.
The absorbance maximum of PVP is around 213 nm; however, after an
exhaustive UV–vis study of this system, we choose to monitor
the absorbance of 280 nm as it showed a good linear correlation with
the PVP concentration (Figure S9). It is
important to mention that this linear relation is highly dependent
on the Au concentration in the solution. Therefore, different values
are observed for different Au concentrations. Figure S9A,B shows the UV–vis spectra of two solutions
of NSt at two different Au0 concentrations, where the PVP
content was gradually changed. Figure S9C shows that, for both cases (and also for three extra different Au
concentrations), there is a clear linear trend with the PVP concentration
but different for each of the Au concentrations.

Influence of
the PVP Concentration
Nine different AuNSt
aliquots (2 mL) of the previously prepared AuNSt seeds were further
cleaned prior to use by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 10 min five
times. After the first centrifugation, the particles were resuspended
in EtOH, and the other four times were in an EtOH/PVP solution with
a defined PVP concentration (0.05, 0.07, 0.12, 0.143, 0.17, 0.21,
0.28, 0.43, and 0.85 mM). The final volume was 2 mL for each sample.
This cleaning procedure was performed to adjust the exact PVP content
of the AuNSt solutions to avoid affecting the final PVP concentration
during the overgrowth process. The influence of the PVP concentration
was tested by adding 1.3 mL of the NSt seeds to EtOH/PVP solutions
containing PVP concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.85 mM (the same
as the seed solutions) at a fixed HAuCl4 concentration.
Their growth kinetics was monitored by UV–vis. The final HAuCl4 and AuNStseeds concentrations used were 8.57 ×
10–5 and 0.5 × 10–4 M, respectively.
The [HAuCl4]/[AuNStseeds] was 1.7, and the [HAuCl4]/[PVP] was varied from 0.1 to 1.5.

Influence of the HAuCl4 Concentration
To
test the influence of the HAuCl4 concentration, R2 was kept constant at 0.2 and the [HAuCl4]/[AuNSt] ratio was varied from 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0,
to 1.5. The AuNSt seed concentration was kept constant at 1.24 ×
10–4 M. Thus, HAuCl4 concentrations of
1.2 × 10–5, 2.4 × 10–5, 4.9 × 10–5, 7.4 × 10–5, 9.9 × 10–5, 12.4 × 10–5, and 18.6 × 10–5 M were used.

Tuning the
λmax of AuNSt
To tune the
λmax, 80 mL of Au stars with λmax at 870 nm was produced. After the synthesis, the obtained AuNSt
were cleaned as previously described. After cleaning, the obtained
AuNSt were prepared to have concentrations of PVP and Au0 of 4 × 10–4 and 1.24 × 10–4 M, respectively. Next, HAuCl4 was added to have a final
concentration of 8 × 10–5 M. The solution was
energetically mixed and then divided in fifteen different aliquots,
5 mL each, and left undisturbed. The evolution of the NSt was monitored
by UV–vis with time and was stopped at the desired wavelength
by the addition of 5 mL of PVP solution in EtOH (1.5 × 10–3 M). Next, the NSt solution was cleaned by centrifugation
(7000 rpm, 10 min) and redispersed in 5 mL of a PVP/EtOH solution
(2.5 × 10–4 M) to assure their stability over
time.

Characterization
UV–vis spectroscopy (Thermo
Scientific Evolution 201) and TEM (JEOL 1011 operating at 100 kV)
were performed to characterize the optical response and size of the
NPs. TEM samples were prepared by drying ethanolic suspensions on
carbon–Formvar-coated 200 mesh copper grids.
