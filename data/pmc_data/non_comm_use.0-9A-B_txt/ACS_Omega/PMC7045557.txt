In this work, the
catalytic gasification of sewage sludge in supercritical
water was investigated in a batch reactor (460 °C, 27 MPa, 6
min), and the separate and combined effects of the catalyst on the
H2 production and phosphorus yield were investigated. The
experimental results indicated that K2CO3 alone
improved the H2 yield, gasification efficiency (GE), and
carbon gasification efficiency (CE). The largest H2 yield
of 54.28 mol/kg was achieved, which was approximately three times
that without a catalyst. Furthermore, the inorganic phosphorus (IP)
yield increased with the addition of K2CO3.
However, when H2O2 was added, the H2 yield quickly decreased with increasing H2O2 coefficient, and more than 97.8% of organic phosphorus (OP) was
converted into IP. The H2 yield increased with the addition
of various K2CO3/H2O2 ratios,
whereas the IP yield decreased.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Sewage sludge is an inevitable
product of wastewater treatment.
The amount of sewage sludge has increased with the construction and
expansion of wastewater treatment plants while stricter policies have
limited its disposal.1 Sewage sludge contains
complex organic materials mainly consisting of carbohydrates (∼14%),
proteins (∼40%), lipids (∼10%), lignin (∼17%),
and ash (30–50%).2

Various
techniques for converting sewage sludge into useful secondary
energy have been developed.3−5 One of the methods for energy
recovery is the gasification of sewage sludge in supercritical water.6 Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) is regarded
as an emerging economical and environmentally friendly technology
for sewage sludge treatment and hydrogen production.7

In recent years, many research studies on the supercritical
water
gasification of sewage sludge have been reported.8−11 To improve the hydrogen yield,
a small amount of oxidant was added in the SCWG process. Both hydrogen
yield5,12 and removal efficiency of organic matter5 in sewage sludge could be improved with the addition
of oxidant (H2O2) in the SCWG of sludge.

The gasification reaction could be accelerated with the addition
of suitable catalysts in SCWG, resulting in an increase in hydrogen
production. These catalysts include metals, carbon, metal oxides,
and alkalies (e.g., KOH, NaOH, K2CO3, and Na2CO3). Alkali catalysts are widely employed for
high hydrogen production and inhibition of tar/char formation.13−15

When the K2CO3 catalyst was added in
the
SCWG process, the gasification efficiency (GE) was enhanced.7 Gong et al.8 also
reported that the hydrogen yield was higher when a combined catalyst
with different Ni/NaOH ratios was used. A multicomponent catalyst
consisting activated carbon and Na2CO3 has been
reported to enhance production and the removal of organics.5

Phosphorus is essential for the growth
of life. As phosphate
resources
have gradually become scarce, it is necessary to look for a sort of
recyclable, environmentally friendly phosphorus resource.16 Sewage sludge has a high phosphorus content,
approximately 8% (w/w), which makes it a potential source of the P
nutrient.17 Phosphorus recovery from sewage
sludge using different methods (e.g., chemical oxidation, subcritical
water process, and SCWG) has been investigated.18−23 Also, the gasification of sewage sludge in supercritical water for
hydrogen production and phosphorus recovery has been investigated.11,24,25 However, systematic studies on
the effects of K2CO3 and H2O2 on hydrogen production and phosphorus recovery during SCWG
of sludge have not been reported.

In this work, the catalytic
gasification of sewage sludge in supercritical
water with the addition of K2CO3 and H2O2 was studied, and the effects of the catalyst separately
and the combined
effects of K2CO3 and H2O2 on hydrogen production and phosphorus recovery were investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effects of K2CO3 and
H2O2 Individually on Gas and Phosphorus Yield
Figure 1 illustrates
the effects of varying the amount of the K2CO3 additive on the H2 gas and phosphorus yields from the
SCWG of sludge at 460 °C and 27 MPa after 6 min. As shown in Figure 1a, an increase in
H2 yield was obtained as the K2CO3 concentration increased. When the K2CO3 concentration
increased from 0 to 8 wt %, the H2 yield increased from
19.86 to 54.28 mol/kg, which was approximately three times that without
catalyst. Unlike the H2, the CO2 yield increased
from 7.13 to 12.57 mol/kg and then reduced to 10.65 mol/kg as the
K2CO3 increased. An inflection point at a concentration
of 6 wt % for K2CO3 was observed. Meanwhile,
the CO and CH4 yields hardly changed with an increase in
the K2CO3 concentration. These results agreed
with previous reports, which showed slight changes in the CO and CH4 yields with increasing K2CO3.26,2726,27 The comparison of this study with previous literature28−35 is shown in Table 1.

and (d) total phosphorus (TP) yield in the liquid sample and solid
residue.

As shown in Figure 1b, similar to the
change in the CO2 yield, the GE and
CE values increased from 49.78 and 257.34% to 80.8 and 368.09%, respectively,
with an increase in the amount of the K2CO3 additive.
As the K2CO3 concentration continued to increase,
the GE and CE reduced to 73.2 and 326.78%, respectively.

As
mentioned above, K2CO3 had an important
catalytic effect on the H2 yield, and the catalytic effect
was enhanced as the K2CO3 concentration increased.
Several previous studies36−38 have reported that alkali catalysts
could significantly enhance the water gas shift reaction (eq 1) 1  Regarding
the catalytic mechanism, the primary
role of the K2CO3 catalyst is to improve the
water gas shift reaction. The catalytic effect of the K2CO3 catalyst can be explained by the following reactions.

K2CO3 reacts with water to produce KHCO3 and alkali. 2  Alkali reacts with CO to form formate salt. 3  Formate salt reacts with water to form H2. 4  KHCO3 decomposes to form CO2. 5  The phosphorus yield
in a liquid sample was
also determined, as shown in Figure 1c,d. The OP yield and the amount of TP in the liquid
production decreased as the amount of K2CO3 increased,
whereas the IP yield and the concentration of TP in the solid residue
increased. The OP yield decreased from 14.6 to 5.08% when the K2CO3 concentration increased from 0 to 8 wt %. OP
was mostly converted into IP within a short time. However, the amount
of TP in the residue increased with the amount of K2CO3, which increased from 36.97 to 52.54%. This result is in
agreement with a previous work.39

Sullivan and Tester40 reported that
OP could be completely eliminated and converted into phosphate in
the final residue within a short time. Under supercritical operating
conditions, gasification proceeds quickly and converts compounds containing
phosphorus to orthophosphoric acid, which can be neutralized to its
corresponding salts and precipitated in the solid residue. The OP
contained in sewage sludge is composed of a collection of phospholipids,
phosphonic compounds, and nucleic acids, which could be eliminated
and converted to IP completely by increasing the K2CO3 concentration, resulting in an increase of IP and TP in the
solid residue.

The gas production and phosphorus yield were
measured when different
amounts of H2O2 (reflected by different oxidation
coefficients varying from 0.5 to 2.5) were added to the SCWG process
of sludge at 460 °C and 27 MPa after 6 min, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Effect of the amount
of H2O2 on the gas and
phosphorus yields from the SCWG of sludge at 460 °C and 27 MPa
after 6 min: (a) gas yield, (b) GE and CE, (C) IP and OP yields, and
(d) TP yield in the liquid production and solid residue.

As shown in Figure 2a, the H2 yield quickly decreased from 3.37 to
0.14 mol/kg
with an increase in the H2O2 coefficient from
0.5 to 2.5, whereas a H2 yield of 19.86 mol/kg was obtained
without the addition of the oxidant. A similar decrease in the CH4 content from 8.16 to 0.15 mol/kg was also observed. However,
the CO2 yield increased directly from 7.13 to 29.77 mol/kg
as the H2O2 coefficient increased from 0 to
2.5.

As shown in Figure 2b, when the H2O2 coefficient was 1.5,
the GE
was higher than 100%. It increased from 114.86 to 131.6% as the H2O2 coefficient increased from 1.5 to 2.5. In addition,
the CE also increased from 333.54 to 502.08% with the addition of
H2O2. As shown in Figure 2c,d, when the H2O2 coefficient
was 2.5, over 97.8% of OP was converted to IP. The amount of TP in
liquid production decreased as the H2O2 coefficient
increased from 0 to 2.5, whereas the concentration of TP in the solid
residue increased. The total mass balance of phosphorus was between
97.7 and 98.8%.

It has been reported that a large amount of
oxidant can enhance
the oxidation reaction and convert combustible gases into H2O and CO2, thereby leading to a decreased H2 yield.28 Our experimental results coincided
with these published results. The experimental results indicated that
a greater number of carbohydrates and phosphorus organic compounds
were decomposed with the addition of H2O2. As
the H2O2 coefficient increased, the oxidation
reaction became dominant in the supercritical water. H2 and CH4 were converted to CO2 and H2O, with an excess of H2O2, which led to a decrease
in the H2 yield. The maximum H2 yield was obtained
without the addition of H2O2. In addition, an
increase in the decomposition of organic compounds and the combustion
of gas containing carbon with the addition of an oxidant to the SCWG
process contributed to a higher CO2 yield, as well as increased
GE and CE values.

The organic phosphorus contained in sewage
sludge is composed of
a collection of phospholipids, phosphonic compounds, nucleic acids,
phosphoproteins, etc. In SCWG, the sufficient H2O2 primarily promotes the oxidation and decomposition of organics in
sludge into small molecule intermediate products at the initial and
middle stages. The P–C bond is promoted to crack with the addition
of H2O2, and OP was converted completely to
IP, resulting in an increase of the IP yield and TP yield in the solid
residue.

2.2 Effect of the Combination of K2CO3 and H2O2 on Gas and Phosphorus
Yields
The effect on the gas and phosphorus yields by simultaneously
adding K2CO3 and H2O2 was
investigated at 460 °C and 27 MPa after 6 min.

We first
assumed that the catalytic effects of H2O2 and
K2CO3 were independent. When they were added
in different proportions, the calculated value of hydrogen production
for the mixture was assumed to be the sum of the results from H2O2 and K2CO3 catalyzation
separately.

As shown in Table 2, there were large differences between the theoretical
values and
experimental data, indicating that H2O2 and
K2CO3 have a synergistic effect on the reaction.
The magnitude of the difference between the theoretical values and
experimental data first increased and then decreased, which indicated
that the K2CO3:H2O2 ratio
also affected the reaction.

2.29	37.81	40.10	22.65	
0.59	47.52	48.11	23.70	
To investigate this further, both K2CO3 and
H2O2 were added to the SCWG of sludge at various
ratios. As mentioned above (shown in Figure 2), when the H2O2 oxidation
coefficient was greater than 1.0, oxidation rather than gasification
dominated in the supercritical water. To investigate the synergistic
effect of K2CO3 and H2O2 on the SCWG reaction, the amount of H2O2 in
the additive mixture (K2CO3 + H2O2) was below the theoretical demand for oxidation. When the
K2CO3:H2O2 ratio was 1:1,
the amount of K2CO3 was approximately 2 wt %.
Five different K2CO3:H2O2 ratios were investigated. As shown in Figure 3a,b, the H2 yield increased from
5.47 to 29.06 mol/kg as the K2CO3:H2O2 ratio increased from 1:4 to 4:1. The H2 yield
obtained with a K2CO3/H2O2 ratio of 1:1 was greater than 21.5 mol/kg, which was obtained with
2 wt % K2CO3. The CO2 yield decreased
from 20.35 to 8.39 mol/kg and then increased to 11.4 mol/kg. The inflection
point of the K2CO3/H2O2 ratio was observed at 1:1. The trends of the GE and CE were similar
to that of the CO2 yield.

from the SCWG of sludge
at 460 °C and 27 MPa after 6 min: (a) gas yield, (b) GE and CE,
(C) IP and OP yields, and (d) TP yield in the liquid production and
solid residue.

The effect of the combination
of K2CO3 and
H2O2 on the phosphorus yield was also determined,
as shown in Figure 3c,d. The IP yield decreased from 95.9 to 90.49% as the K2CO3/H2O2 ratio increased. This result
coincided with those for K2CO3 and H2O2 separately. However, OP increased as the ratio increased.
The fraction of TP in the solid residue first decreased from 71.94
to 46.78% and then increased to 50.23%. When the amount of H2O2 increased, OP was almost completely converted to IP.

As shown in Figure 3a, the mixing ratio of K2CO3 to H2O2 affected the H2 production and phosphorus
yield. When the ratio of K2CO3 to H2O2 was less than 1:1, the amount of H2O2 was greater than that of K2CO3 and
incomplete oxidation dominated in the SCWG process. Xu et al.27 reported that H2 and CO will be fully
oxidized to H2O and CO2 in case of excess of
oxidant, which results in a decreased H2 yield. However,
because of the incomplete oxidation with insufficient H2O2, CO will be generated from hydrocarbons in sludge.
The production of CO promoted the water gas shift reaction (eq 1), enhancing the H2 yield. With K2CO3, the yield of hydrogen
is higher than that without K2CO3 (Table 3). The K2CO3 alkali catalyst had more effect on the water gas shift
reaction. In contrast, the effect of K2CO3 on
gasification was much stronger than that of H2O2 when the ratio was greater than 1:1. In the SCWG process, H2 was mainly derived from the reforming reactions of small
intermediates.41

In the absence of K2CO3 or H2O2, it is difficult for
high-molecular-weight organic compounds
to break down into low-molecular-weight compounds. When H2O2 was added, the gasification products mainly consisted
of low-molecular-weight linear compounds. Meanwhile, complex organic
matters such as cyclic compounds were enhanced to open the ring, resulting
in the generation of low-molecular-weight linear compounds. Further
gasification of these intermediates will be promoted with the addition
of the K2CO3 catalyst. The compounds in the
raw sewage sludge solution and the liquid gasification products are
shown in Table 3.

As shown in Table 3, the main compounds in the raw sewage sludge solution are dimethoxybutane
and other complex carbohydrates, with small amounts of nitrogen and
phosphorus compounds. In the chromatogram, the ratio of the peak area
of dimethoxybutane is 13.25%, which is approximately twice the area
of any other compounds before gasification. After gasification in
supercritical water, the main compounds in the liquid products are
phenolic compounds and a few nitrogen compounds with small molecular
weights. Methylbenzaldehyde is the main compound in the liquid products,
with a 10.98% peak area ratio in the chromatogram. Therefore, K2CO3 in the additive mixture can effectively enhance
the gasification of the intermediates as soon as possible. With the
increase of the mass fraction of K2CO3, the
TP content in solid residues decreased and the IP yield increased
gradually. This indicated that organic phosphorus can be completely
converted under the catalysis of K2CO3.

3 Conclusions
Few studies have attempted to simultaneously
recover phosphorus
and generate syngas from sludge using SCWG. However, the influence
of alkali catalysts on phosphorus recovery in the SCWG of sludge has
not been reported. The effect of the combination of K2CO3 and H2O2 on the hydrogen production
and phosphorus yield was investigated for the first time in this work.
When K2CO3 was used as a single additive, GE
and CE were improved with the increase of K2CO3. Hydrogen yield was approximately three times that without a catalyst.
The OP in the sewage sludge could be eliminated and converted to IP
by increasing the K2CO3 concentration. However,
when H2O2 was added separately to the SCWG process,
the H2 yield sharply declined and carbon dioxide was the
dominant gaseous gasification product. Furthermore, more than 97.8%
of the OP was converted to IP. H2O2 and K2CO3 have a synergistic effect on the gasification.
With the increase of the ratio of K2CO3 to H2O2, the K2CO3 catalyst had
more effect on the water gas shift reaction, resulting in improvement
of the hydrogen yield. Meanwhile, under the catalysis of K2CO3, more organic phosphorus can be completely converted
into inorganic phosphorus (IP), resulting in a decrease of the TP
yield and an increase of the IP yield.

4.2 Supercritical Water Gasification
System
The SCWG of the sewage sludge was performed in an
HC276 stainless
steel batch reactor, which was purchased from the Huaan Supercritical
Extraction Co., Ltd., Nantong, Jiangsu, China. The reactor was described
in detail in an earlier study.42

In a typical experiment, 3.0 g of sewage sludge with deionized water
(100 mL) was added in the reactor. Different amounts of K2CO3 catalysts were mixed with the sewage sludge. Then,
this mixture was loaded into the reactor. The reactor was electrically
heated at an average heating rate of 3 °C/min. Once the reaction
temperature (460 °C) was reached, the reaction was maintained
for 6 min. At the end of each experiment, heating was stopped and
the reactor was rapidly cooled to room temperature with cooling water.
After the reactor had cooled, gas and liquid samples from the reactor
were collected and submitted for analysis. Methods for the collection
and separation of solid and liquid products have been described previously
in detail.42

4.3 Analytical
Methods
An Elementar Vario-III
was used to analyze the organic elemental of sewage sludge. Furthermore,
Agilent 890A/5975C was used to analyze the gasification liquid product,
which was equipped with a DB-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm id, 0.25
μm film thickness) using high-purity helium as the carrier gas.
Mass spectrometry was performed in a selected ion-monitoring mode.
The mass spectrometry (MS) transfer line temperature was 270 °C,
and the ion source temperature was 220 °C. The column temperature
was initially held at 60 °C for 5 min, increased to 270 °C
at a rate of 30 °C/min, and held at this temperature for 5 min.
The injection volume was 10 μL. The total flow rate of the carrier
gas was 25.0 mL/min, and the split flow rate was 20.0 mL/min.

The TP content in the dewatered raw sewage sludge and gasification
solid residue were analyzed using an Agilent inductively coupled plasma-optical
emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The amount of TP in the liquid sample
was analyzed using Chinese national methods (Ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric
method, GB 11893-89). In addition, the SMT methodology was used to
quantify the IP in the liquid sample.

The gas samples were analyzed
with a gas chromatograph (Nanjing,
GC5890), which was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TDX-01)
to determine the H2, CH4, CO2, and
CO concentrations.

The TP and IP yields were determined as follows 6   7  The OP yield was obtained by subtracting
the
IP yield from the TP yield.

The oxidation coefficient was defined
as8 8  The gas yield (GH2,GCH4, GCO2, and GCO), GE, and CE have been described in detail in an earlier
study.42
