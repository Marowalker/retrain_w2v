Poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS)
is a widely used conductive polymer (CP) for applications in electronic
devices. In the context of transparent electrodes or soft actuators,
the uptake of water by PEDOT:PSS is an essential element in the performance
of the physical system. We study the water uptake of pure films and
films treated with ethylene glycol (EG) commonly used to enhance the
electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS. Gravimetric analysis was used
to investigate the water sorption–desorption of PEDOT:PSS and
its change with the EG treatment for a wide range of configurations
(thickness, temperature, and relative humidity). We demonstrate that
a simple Fickian model cannot correctly represent the experimental
results; we therefore introduce a fully coupled reaction–diffusion
scheme. This model describes the transport of diffusing molecules
into the polymer film, taking into account, in addition to the classical
diffusion mechanism, the reaction between the reactive sites of the
polymer network and the water molecules. We demonstrate that solvent
treatments have a direct influence on the kinetics of the water uptake
of PEDOT:PSS films in terms of diffusivity, solubility, and rate of
reaction. The proposed model can be used to accurately predict the
water uptake of CP films in the case of complex three-dimensional
configurations that are needed for the design of complex actuators.

Introduction
Because of their lightweight, flexibility,
and ease of processability,
organic conductive polymers (CPs) are widely applied in electronic
devices.1 The most successful polymer is
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS).
Its tunable electrical properties (conductivity can reach 4000 S/cm
by using proper treatment2−4), low-voltage-driven actuation
mechanism,5 and the recently revealed self-healing
effect6 make PEDOT:PSS a good candidate
for transparent electrodes, organic solar cells, organic light-emitting
diodes, wearable textiles, artificial muscles, sensors, and actuators.1,5,7−10

PEDOT:PSS features a strong
coupling among its chemical, mechanical,
and electrical behaviors, which has resulted in many applications
in the field of electromechanical actuators.11 The mechanism of actuation comes from the hygroscopic nature of
PSS that very easily absorbs water from the environment. Water molecules
can actually exist in very different configurations. As shown by ref (12), based on the observation
of isosteric heat of sorption, water molecules will mainly be adsorbed
on the hydrophilic sulfonic acid groups at a low sorption degree.
At a higher sorption degree, the active sites are totally saturated
and water is in a free-water configuration. The absorbed water molecules
increase the distance between the PEDOT:PSS grains, causing a volume
increase. When an electric current is applied, the Joule effect results
in the generation of in-the-volume heat, consequently changing the
temperature. It results in the release of the previously absorbed
water molecules, which translates into geometrical shrinking at the
macroscale. PEDOT:PSS-based actuators can be operated under low voltages
(0–10 V) that makes them particularly appealing for wearable
electronic applications.5

Considering
the phenomenology described above, water content plays
a major role in PEDOT:PSS actuation properties. This phenomenology
has been well studied for other families of CPs such as polypyrrole,
with the pioneering work of Okuzaki’s group,13−15 but still additional
data are needed in case of PEDOT:PSS. More generally, all properties
of PEDOT:PSS are highly dependent on its water content. A decrease
in Young’s modulus, along with an increase in the relative
humidity (RH) of the environment, was reported in previous studies.16 This happens because of the weakened hydrogen
bonding between the PEDOT and PSS grains, during the water uptake
of hygroscopic PSS. In addition, water molecules increase the distance
between PEDOT oligomers, resulting in an increase of electrical resistivity.17 A change in the distribution of both stress
and strain was also observed.16 These results
illustrate the crucial role of the water sorption mechanism of PEDOT:PSS
in modifying the complete behavior of the film. Today, the phenomenological
aspects of the PEDOT:PSS actuation and water sorption are well known.
The amount of water vapor sorption decreases with an increase in temperature
and hysteresis between the sorption and desorption isotherms that
were previously reported,11 and there is
a good understanding of the sorption isotherms from the thermodynamic
viewpoint. Interesting works have been done recently, investigating
the effect of microstructure (and especially the PEDOT:PSS ratio)
on the coupling among water sorption, swelling, and electrical properties.18 However, to the best of our knowledge, there
is no model or systematic data to describe the interplay among water
absorption, mechanical expansion, and electrical stimulus. Elucidating
the role of each component in the actuation properties is needed to
further optimize and tailor soft actuators based on such materials.

The objective of this paper is to provide a reliable macroscopic
modeling of the water uptake in PEDOT:PSS films that can be used to
better design transparent PEDOT:PSS electronics or actuators. To do
so, we explore a wide range of experimental conditions, both during
the sorption and desorption tests in order for our set of data to
discriminate between the different modeling approaches.

We first
used gravimetric analysis to understand the absorption–desorption
mechanism by monitoring the water uptake of the film at a macroscopic
level. The obtained data clearly show that a simple Fickian model
presents severe limitations; we therefore need a more complex modeling
approach. We decide to adopt the reaction–diffusion scheme
proposed by El Yagoubi et al.19 to model
the water uptake behavior. This model takes into account the reaction
between water molecules and the substrate, in addition to the classical
diffusion. Finally, we discuss how the constitutive parameters of
this model are modified when classical treatments, such as pretreatment
or post-treatment with ethylene glycol (EG), are used.

Materials and Methods
Material Preparation
An aqueous PEDOT:PSS dispersion
(Clevios PH1000) was purchased from HC Starck, Inc. PH1000 was chosen
because of its high electrical conductivity in comparison to other
commercially available grades. It has a 1:2.5 w/w ratio of PEDOT to
PSS. We study three types of films: pure, pretreated, and post-treated
PEDOT:PSS. For each configuration, a drop-casting technique was used
to prepare the films. A square Petri dish of size 8.5 cm × 8.5
cm, covered with a Teflon paper, was plasma-treated to remove the
impurities and to maximize wettability. An Expanded Plasma Cleaner
PDC-001 from Harrick Plasma was used at high power and 400 mTorr pressure,
for 5 min. An adequate amount of the dispersion was then poured into
the dish and cured in a fume hood for 48 h, at room temperature.

The pretreatment process was performed by adding the solvent EG (3
wt %) to the aqueous PEDOT:PSS dispersion. The solution was mixed
for 6 h in a fume hood.

The post-treatment process was performed
on a pure PEDOT:PSS film.
The pure PEDOT:PSS film samples were placed inside a beaker filled
with EG for 6 h and then removed.

The pretreated and post-treated
films were annealed at 120 °C
for 2 h. Let us note that we use “pretreated” and “post-treated”
for naming samples after EG addition or EG rinsing and that we do
not refer to oxidation/reduction of the CP. Three sample thicknesses
(2L) were considered for pure films: 2L = 15 μm, 2L = 50 μm, and 2L = 100 μm, whereas only 50 μm was used for pretreated
and post-treated films. The choice of relatively large thicknesses
is motivated by applications on soft robotics and soft actuators,
for which thicknesses are usually much larger compared to the films
used for transparent electrodes. Film thicknesses were measured using
a digital micrometer with a 1 μm accuracy. The drop-casting
method is known for the ease of film preparation, but this method
makes it difficult to control the film thickness and uniformity. Therefore,
there was a 10% variation of thickness in polymer film samples. For
this reason, the thickness of each individual sample was measured
after processing, in order to secure accurate data.

Gravimetric Test
For gravimetric measurements, dried
polymer films were cut into 7 mm by 7 mm squares using a CO2 universal laser system PLS 6.75. The following laser settings were
used: speed: 5.0%; pulses per inch: 750; Z-axis:
4.00 mm; and power: 0.5, 1.5, and 2%, depending on the thickness of
the film.

An IGAsorp dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) analyzer (Hiden
Isochema) was used for gravimetric measurements. The temperature and
RH, within the isolated chamber, were controlled while monitoring
the mass uptake of the specimen with an embedded 10 μg resolution
microbalance. The polymer samples were placed on a suspended stainless
steel mesh inside the chamber, in order for both sides of the film
to be exposed to the environment. Three configurations of the material
were considered: pure, pretreated, and post-treated PEDOT:PSS. For
each configuration, different samples were tested at different temperatures
(26, 37, 50, and 80 °C) and RH’s (30, 60, and 80%), making
a total of 36 different configurations. For each configuration, both
the absorption and desorption responses were investigated. Each test
was repeated three times.

We performed a systematic conditioning
of the film: the water content
of the film was removed prior to humidity exposure by drying the sample
inside the equipment until the mass equilibrium was reached. The dried
polymer films were exposed to a flow of 250 mL/min moist air until
stabilization, followed by a desorption test, by keeping the temperature
constant but prescribing the humidity level to 0%. The gas environment
was controlled by mixing wet air with a dry flow of nitrogen. The
DVS analyzer allowed the measurement of the mass uptake, m(t), every 20 s, which is a relatively high rate.

The results from the gravimetric tests were plotted as a ratio
of the mass of absorbed water by the PEDOT:PSS film, Δm, to the mass of the dry sample, m0, defined as relative water uptake 1  where 2  

Numerical Implementation
Gravimetric tests were reproduced
using the COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2 software in which we implemented
the model described briefly in the section and completely in the Supporting Information. Assuming that the thickness
of the polymer film is much less than its width and length, a one-dimensional
simulation was conducted. Considering the symmetry of the film, half
of the thickness (L) was analyzed. The RH values
were taken directly from the results file of the DVS chamber, for
all configurations, to reproduce a real environment.

The mass
uptake was derived, considering both the free (w)
and bonded water (Y) 3  where MH2O = 0.018 kg/mol is the molar mass of water, ρ0 = 1350 kg m–3 is the initial density, and V0 is the initial volume of the sample.

The simulation and experimental curves were compared using a MATLAB
Optimization Toolbox function “lsqnonlin”, which solves
nonlinear least-squares data-fitting problems. The seven parameters
of the model (S0, S1, D0, D1, kh, kr,
and R0; see Supporting Information) were optimized. “lsqnonlin” minimizes
the sum of squares of the vector-valued function, which is the difference
between the experimental and simulation data. Also, the initial value
of the function and its lower and upper bounds were specified individually,
for each parameter. Iteration terminates when the solver reaches the
stopping criteria specified by the user. For this problem, stopping
criteria were the tolerance of the function value (1 × 10–8) and the number of maximum iterations (500). Each
curve was optimized separately, and the parameters found for the first
simulated curve were used as initial values for the next curves.

Results
Here, we only discuss raw experimental results
without introducing
any modeling consideration or opinion, which we will do in the Discussion section.

Figure 1 shows the
evolution of the relative water uptake of pure PEDOT:PSS as a function
of % RH change, at a constant temperature of 50 °C, for three
thicknesses: (a,b) 15, (c,d) 50, and (e,f) 100 μm. The corresponding
data for other temperatures are available in the Supporting Information (Figures S4–S7). Gravimetric
experiments were found reproducible for all configurations. One test
for each case is presented. Stabilization of mass was reached for
all experimental configurations during the 3 h absorption test. We
only plot the first hour of water absorption and the first hour of
water desorption. The amount of absorbed water varies from a minimum
of 3% (30% RH, 80 °C, see Figure S7) to a maximum of 56% (80% RH, 26 °C). All sorption curves (Figure 1a,c,d) display a
saturation plateau that is constant until desorption starts.

Figure 1 Sorption–desorption
curves for (a,b) 15, (c,d) 50, and (e,f)
100 μm thick pure PEDOT:PSS films exposed to 30% RH, 60% RH,
and 80% RH at 50 °C. The water uptake is dimensionless and defined
by eq 1.

It is important to note the asymmetry between the
absorption and
desorption processes. During the absorption process, the polymer film
uptakes water molecules relatively fast at the beginning, but the
desorption process appears much slower. After a 1 h desorption process,
we found that the PEDOT:PSS films still contained some residual mass
uptake. We also observed that higher humidity level slightly increases
the amount of residual water in the network.

Figure 2 illustrates
the sorption–desorption curves for a 50 μm pure PEDOT:PSS
film exposed to 60% RH at four different temperatures. The amount
of diffused water decreases with an increase in temperature. This
result is consistent with Okuzaki’s findings.11 The saturation point is reached faster at higher temperatures,
both for sorption (Figure 2a) and desorption (Figure 2b).

Figure 2 (a) Sorption and (b) desorption curves for a 50 μm
pure PEDOT:PSS
film exposed to 60% RH at 26, 37, 50 ,and 80 °C.

Figure 3a presents
how the solvent treatment affects the water uptake process. We still
do not introduce any model here and only focus on facts that can be
directly observed from the experimental curves. The results indicate
that the EG treatment (both pretreatment and post-treatment) induces
a decrease of water uptake in the film, at saturation, in comparison
with pure films, because of the structural changes it causes. The
water uptake of the pretreated film is also always higher than the
one of the post-treated film. This is consistent with the removal
of PSS sites from the surface of the PEDOT:PSS film during the post-treatment
process, which results in a decrease in the amount of reactive sites
that bond with water molecules. In addition, the normalized water
content of the post-treated film after 1000 s of desorption is less
than that of pure and pretreated films (Figure 3b). A slightly faster water release is due
to the lower number of reactions taking place in the polymer network
associated with less PSS. It means that the part of free volume-associated
water is more important in post-treated films than in other films,
which is also consistent with the removal of PSS by washing. We would
ascribe the slower desorption in the pretreated film compared to pure
films to a reorganization of the microstructure (at constant PSS content).
Because of the changes in conformation in the chains, the microstructure
rearranges, resulting in a more dense network, less free volume, and
slower desorption. This effect is, however, of second order as the
associated variations are very small.

Discussion
These experimental results (asymmetry in
kinetics between absorption
and desorption and the existence of a non-negligible amount of residual
water uptake after drying) suggest a non-Fickian absorption behavior.
Indeed, we tried to represent these experimental results using a simple
Fickian approach, but we could not represent both absorption and desorption
with a unique set of material parameters. An example is provided in
the Supporting Information (Section 1).
Our results suggest a much more complex response that should be taken
into account for the interactions between the diffused water and the
substrate. The change in the microstructure triggered by the EG treatment
can also strongly influence this interaction.

We adapt a more
general model introduced by El Yagoubi and Lubineau.19 In addition to the classical diffusion, it takes
into account the reaction of water molecules with the substrate that
result in a global diffusion–reaction mechanism. The diffusing
molecules, w, and the reactive site of the polymer, R, form a complex Y 4  where w, R, and Y coexist in the domain Ω. The unit
of concentration is mol m–3.

We assume a first-order
reaction for which the global rate of creation/consumption
of water (rw) is given by the concentrations
of reactants and products and by the rate constants (kh: rate constant of the forward reaction, kr: rate constant of the backward reaction) in a constant
volume 5  where kh in m3 mol–1 s–1 and kr in s–1 are the functions
of temperature.

The change of water concentration, at any point
and any time, is
the result of both the diffusion of free water and its interaction
with the substrate (to create the complex Y made
of the substrate and bonded water), such that 6  where j is the free-water flux. The full model is described in the Supporting Information (Section 2). The free-water
flux (and diffusion of water in general) mainly depends on two material
parameters: the diffusivity D (in m2 s–1) and the solubility S (in mol m–3 Pa–1). In case of non-Fickian diffusion,
these material parameters eventually largely depend on the microstructure
that evolves in time because of the reaction. Indeed, any structural
reorganization will modify the free volume and the internal diffusion
path, eventually modifying the effective macroscopic diffusion coefficient
and solubility that measure how fast the diffusion is and how much
can be absorbed, respectively. We model the effects of these microstructural
changes in a simple way. From a macroscopic perspective, we assume
a linear relationship among the reaction product Y, the diffusivity D, and/or the solubility S 7  

As Y is the product
of the reaction, with an initial
concentration equal to zero, a linear relationship is the most simple
model we can have that comes naturally from an asymptotic expansion
around zero. Of course, more complex relations could be imagined,
but these would not be relevant here as we could not discriminate
between them based on the available experimental data. To summarize,
this model describes the progressive conversion of the reactive sites
(R) of the substrate into bonded water (Y) by interaction with the diffusing water (w). The
initial concentration of the reactive site available in the polymer
film to undergo chemical reaction is noted R0. The complete formulation of the model, for our case, and
the numerical implementation in COMSOL Multiphysics and MATLAB Optimization
toolbox, are given in the Supporting Information.

After a necessary calibration step (described in the Supporting Information), we first demonstrated
that this diffusion–reaction model was able to describe the
absorption–desorption results for pure, pretreated, and post-treated
films at all (T, % RH) configurations. The data for
the 50 μm film exposed to three humidity levels at 50 °C
are presented in Figure 4a–c, where dashed lines represent the corresponding simulation
results. Figure 4d–f
shows the contribution of “diffusing” (w) and “reacting” (Y) water into the
water uptake of pure, pretreated, and post-treated PEDOT:PSS films
at 50 °C exposed to 60% RH. According to these results, mass
uptake comes mainly from the diffusion of free water, but the bonded
water described in the “reaction part” largely contributes
to explain the response during desorption. The proposed model described
all configurations with similar accuracies.

between the simulation and experimental
curves for 50 μm at 50 °C; (d–f) contribution of
“diffusing” and “reacting” water into
the water uptake of PEDOT:PSS exposed to 60% RH.

It is then interesting to study and explain how
the parameters
of the model vary with the different configurations. The initial solubility
constant S0, the initial diffusivity constant D0, and the quantity R0 of the sulfonate groups accessible for reaction at the beginning
of the process are of particular interest. At room temperature, and
for pure PEDOT:PSS, their values were S0 = 11.1 mol m–3 Pa–1, D0 = 1.6 × 10–12 m2 s–1, and R0 = 2730 mol m–3, respectively.

Figure 5 illustrates
how the aforementioned parameters vary with various solvent treatments
and at different temperatures. The way these parameters change, depending
on the configuration, provides additional insights into the physical
process and the following important parameters as discussed below.

Figure 5 Evolution
of (a) solubility constant S0, (b) diffusion
constant D0, and (c)
concentration of available reactive sites R0 with temperature increase for pure, EG-treated, and post-treated
films.

About the Solubility Constant S0 with Temperature
In all cases, S0 decreases with a temperature increase (Figure 5a). Higher temperatures lead to the strengthening
of the hydrogen bond between the PSS chain and the PEDOT:PSS grains.20 This means that it will be more difficult for
the water molecules to bond with the sulfonate groups, as less space
is made available for the uptake of water.

About the Diffusivity Constant D0 with Temperature
D0 increases
with a temperature increase for all film types (Figure 5b); however, the change is not drastic, compared
to S0. This can be explained by two competing
mechanisms: (i) the increase in temperature causes an increase in
the kinetic energy of diffusing molecules, resulting in an acceleration
of the diffusion process (this mechanism usually explains the exponential
change with temperature of the diffusivity constant for a pure Fickian
process) and (ii) the drying polymer film becomes densely packed,
decelerating the diffusion process. The first phenomenon is dominant,
as D0 still has a positive trend with
the increase in temperature.

About the Quantity of Available Sites for Reaction R0 with Temperature
The decrease of the reactive
substrate concentration (R0) with temperature
is also ascribed to the change in the microstructure. Less PSS is
accessible to undergo a chemical reaction in the compacted structure,
which translates into a reduction of the apparent quantities of sites
available for reaction (R0). An in-depth
investigation of the change in the microstructure with temperature
can be found in ref (20)

The observed evolution of these parameters with the addition
of solvents (Figure 5) is also compatible with the expected changes in the PEDOT:PSS film’s
structural order as discussed below.

About the Evolution with EG Pretreatment
Adding an
EG solvent into the PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution changes the conformation
of the PEDOT chains from a benzoid (coiled) to a quinoid structure
(linear).21 This leads to an increase in
the number of interchain interactions because interactions among chains
of linear conformation are facilitated, compared to the coiled conformation.
Therefore, EG enhances the organization of the microstructure and
promotes a more packed configuration.22,23 Such a microstructure
will be more difficult to penetrate and will leave less free volume
for the diffusion process to happen. These changes can be seen in Figure 5a, where the solubility
of the pretreated film is lower than the solubility of the pure film;
it results in the slow diffusion process (D0 decreased, see Figure 5b) and in the reduction of concentration of accessible sulfonate
groups for bonding (see Figure 5c).

About the Evolution with EG Post-Treatment
The pure
PEDOT:PSS film was post-treated by immersion into the EG solvent,
which partially removes the hygroscopic PSS from the surface. Therefore,
it uptakes the least amount of water among the three films (Figure 5a), resulting in
a reduction in the concentration of reactive sites for water molecules
to bond with (Figure 5c). The bulk of post-treated film remains similar to that of the
pure film, which explains the similarity in the diffusion coefficients
for both films (Figure 5b).

Finally, the chemical reaction between the diffusing molecules
and the substrate is described in our model by the forward (kh) and backward (kr) rate constants, which follows Arrhenius’ law 8  where A is a pre-exponential
factor, Rg is the universal gas constant,
and Ea is the activation energy.

Figure 6 illustrates
how the logarithm of rate constants changes with the inverse of temperature.
The lines fit to Arrhenius’ law for the temperatures 26, 37,
50, and 80 °C. The EG treatment significantly affects the temperature
dependence of the rate constants. The differences between the slopes
for pure and treated films can be attributed to the morphological
reorganization taking place after the solvent treatment. The values
of Ea for the different film types are
given in Table 1. For
both rate constants, the activation energies of EG-treated films are
higher than those for the pure film.

(b) kr with temperature, for pure, EG-treated,
and post-treated films.

Conclusions
We have studied the absorption–desorption
mechanism of PEDOT:PSS
and investigated the effects of EG treatment (pretreatment and post-treatment).
Gravimetric tests were used to provide the evolution of water uptake
in polymer films at different temperatures and RH levels. Following
the pretreatment with EG, a morphological reorganization of the polymer
network and a loss in free volume resulted in a decrease in water
uptake. For the post-treated film, the removal of the hydrophilic
sites of PSS contributed to the reduction in the amount of water reacting
with the polymer.

The water transport process was described
using a diffusion–reaction
model by implementing it in a COMSOL Multiphysics and MATLAB optimization
toolbox. A set of parameters was identified to describe the kinetics
of sorption and desorption. The simulation results showed the same
trend as the one found in experimental tests for solubility change.
The evolution of each key parameter with respect to temperature and
solvent treatment was found consistent with the physical considerations.

This study highlights the dependence of the behavior of PEDOT:PSS
on the environmental conditions and the influence of EG treatment
on water transport kinetics. This is the first step in the establishment
of a complete Multiphysics model needed for the design of complex
PEDOT:PSS-based components.
