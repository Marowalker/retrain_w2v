The
local environments within an amphiphilic polymer shell wrapped
around lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles were probed using
steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy techniques.
Emission lifetime measurements of pyrene chromophores trapped within
the polymer shell reveal that there are at least two environments,
where the organic pyrene molecules are encapsulated in hydrophobic
environments that have lower polarity than in water. The migration
of pyrene chromophores from their initial location to another location
was also observed, demonstrating that the polymeric shell provides
both hydrophobicity and mobility for entrapped molecules. These results
offer insight into what outcomes can be expected when chemical reactions
are carried out in these nanoassemblies, especially if they are to
be used as nanoreactors for synthesis or delivery vehicles for therapeutics.

1 Introduction
Water-dispersible
nanoassemblies composed of amphiphilic polymers
wrapped around inorganic nanoparticles offer confined lipophilic spaces
that sequester hydrophobic species from the bulk aqueous environment
(Figure 1). These microenvironments
can result in significant changes in how the encapsulated molecules
behave compared to the same molecules dispersed in bulk solution.1 The changes in properties of molecules within
a confined microenvironment include molecular dynamics,2 fluorescence,3 bond
vibrations,4 binding affinities,5 and electrochemistry.6

Figure 1 Proposed
structure of the water-dispersible nanosystem. Amphiphilic
polymers encapsulate inorganic nanoparticles and provide a hydrophobic
inner layer where hydrophobic molecules can be trapped. The hydrophilic
outer layer renders the entire assembly water dispersible.

Previously, we showed that the reversible photochemical
reactions
of hydrophobic chromophores, which typically require nonpolar organic
solvents for optimal performance (the reactions are significantly
suppressed in water), can be carried out to the same extent in water
when they are entrapped within a nanoassembly’s polymeric shell.7−10 In these cases, the nanoparticles are upconverting nanoparticles
(UCNPs) composed of crystalline NaYF4 doped with trivalent
lanthanide ions such as Er3+ and Tm3+, which
have the interesting optical property that they absorb multiple photons
of 980 nm near-infrared light and combine them to emit UV and visible
photons of several wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum.11,12 We have used these UCNPs to activate reversible photochemical reactions
of small photochromic molecules encapsulated in water-dispersible
nanoassemblies. Clearly, the fact that the photochemical behavior
observed in nonpolar solvents is retained in aqueous solutions is
due to the fact that the chromophores must reside in nonpolar local
environments even though the entire assembly is in water. One can
speculate that the chromophores are located close to the surface of
the nanoparticles as this is likely to be the least polar environment
(Figure 1), although
this speculation requires evidence to support it. This is the focus
of the studies described herein. A better understanding of the polarity
of the shell will also help determine how versatile are the nanoassemblies
for carrying out specific photoreactions and for trapping small molecules.
For example, if free water is present within the polymeric shell,
many photoreactions will be affected because they are limited or completely
shut down when water is present.13−15 In other cases, such
as the photochemical release of caged compounds using benzoin derivatives,
water interferes with the photolysis pathway and generates different
products than when carried out in “dry” environments.16 The importance of the local environment to control
photoreactions has also been highlighted when reactions are carried
out within micelles or other supramolecular systems.17,18 It is, therefore, important to predict if small molecules and reactants
within confined spaces are localized in one environment with defined
properties or if they are in several environments each having different
properties, which could lead to different reactivities within the
same assembly. Two illustrative and opposing examples are (1) sodium
dodecyl sulfate micelles that incorporate molecules in one average
environment display one type of reactivity, whereas (2) molecules
within bile salt micelles can be located in unalike binding sites
resulting in different behaviors.19−21

Our goals are
to elucidate the microenvironments of our previously
reported nanoassemblies in much more detail to provide guidelines
for applying them as delivery systems and as catalysts for carrying
out biphasic hydrophobic/hydrophilic reactions in a homogeneous dispersion.
The focus is to identify whether the nanoassemblies have local areas
of different polarities for trapping a hydrophobic molecule, which
could infer that these sites have different contents of water. We
chose to use encapsulated pyrene chromophores as they are commonly
used fluorescent molecules to probe the polarity of local environments.
This is achieved by comparing the ratio of the intensities of the
first to third vibronic emission bands (I/III ratio) of the five distinct
bands in the emission spectrum,22,23 which is very sensitive
to the polarity of the solvent surrounding the chromophore.22,23 A larger I/III ratio indicates higher polarity such as when pyrene
is in an aqueous solution, whereas a smaller value reflects the pyrene
molecules residing in less polar conditions, as for example pyrene
located in less polar solvents,22,23 trapped within micelles,
or encapsulated within dendrimers.17,18,24 This solvent-dependent fluorescence has made pyrene
one of the most versatile probes to characterize microenvironments.17,25 In this report, we use pyrene to investigate the nature of the amphiphilic
polymer shell using a combination of steady-state and time-resolved
spectroscopy and show that there are at least two microenvironments
existing in our nanosystems.

2 Results and Discussion
The synthesis of the nanoassembly of interest is shown in Scheme 1 and follows the
same general “plug-and-play” protocol we have previously
used.7,9 In the first step, cumene-terminated poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (PSMA) is stirred with JEFFAMINE 2070
in chloroform to produce the amphiphilic polymer P1.
Treating this polymer with the oleic acid-coated lanthanide-doped
UCNPs (β-NaYF4: 2 mol % Er3+, 20 mol %
Yb3+) (NaYF4:ErYb) and pyrene, followed by replacing
CHCl3 with basic water induces the self-assembly process
and results in the final nanosystems (P1-NP-pyr) where
the polymer is wrapped around the nanoparticle and the pyrene chromophores
are trapped within the hydrophobic shell. Two batches were prepared
by this procedure from the identical starting materials to compare
the reproducibility of self-assembly. This route can also be used
to prepare control nanoassemblies lacking the pyrene chromophores
(denoted “P1-NP” in this paper) by omitting
the pyrene in the self-assembly step.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Pyrene-Containing
Nanoassembly P1-NP-pyr
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the uranyl
acetate-stained
nanoassemblies show the presence of the organic shell as indicated
by faint rings surrounding the darker inorganic nanoparticles for
both batches of P1-NP-pyr (Figure 2a,b). This observation is consistent with
our previously reported nanoassemblies.7 Because the two nanoassemblies are made from the same sample of
UCNPs and TEM typically shows only inorganic structures with high
contrast, the average sizes of both batches are identical (average
size = 24.1 ± 0.8 nm not accounting for the faint halos that
surround the dark images), which correlate with that for the original
oleic acid-coated UCNPs.26 The size distribution
of the nanoassemblies including the organic shells can be estimated
using dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques, which results in
an average hydrodynamic diameter of 32.8 ± 0.3 nm for the first
batch of P1-NP-pyr (Figure 2c) and 32.8 ± 0.7 for the second batch
(Figure 2d).26 If the thickness of the organic outer layer
is estimated using the idealized, fully extended view of the mPEGs
side chains, a value of 10–11 nm is the result. However, the
combination of TEM and DLS measurements suggests thicknesses of 8.7
± 0.9 and 8.7 ± 1.1 nm (the average size of inner UCNPs
subtracted from the total hydrodynamic diameter), implying that in
aqueous environments, the polymeric shell around the nanoparticles
exists in a slightly compressed form rather than being fully extended.
This result also suggests that it is unlikely that each nanoparticle
is surrounded by more than one polymer layer.

and polymeric shell (light halo). DLS measurements showing the hydrodynamic
size distribution of P1-NP-pyr nanoassemblies dispersed

(batch 1, solid line; batch 2, dashed line). (f) UV–vis absorbance
spectra of aqueous dispersions of P1-NP-pyr (batch 1,
1.6 × 10–6 M pyrene, solid line; batch 2, 3.4
× 10–6 M pyrene, dashed line), and the control
sample without pyrene (dotted line).28

The differences between the two
batches are observed when the amount
of organic material is analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
which showed that there is more than twice the weight loss in the
second batch than that in the first (Figure 2e). This difference in weight loss indicates
that the second batch of P1-NP-pyr nanoassemblies must
have a larger amount (2.5 times) of organic material surrounding the
core UCNPs. Although these TGA measurements also show that there are
more nanoparticles in batch 2 because of weighing error, this increase
is less than 30% (3.04 × 10–3 g for batch 1
and 3.89 × 10–3 g for batch 2) and does not
account for the 2.5 times increase in the organic material. Because
DLS shows that the two batches have similar sizes, the difference
in weight loss could be explained by assuming that the polymer coating
is more densely packed around the nanoparticles and/or there is a
higher loading of pyrene chromophores trapped within the polymer layer.
The latter explanation is supported by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy,
although the polymer accounts for the majority of the difference in
mass. Figure 2f shows
the characteristic absorption bands between 300 and 350 nm corresponding
to the pyrene chromophore in an aqueous dispersion of both batches
of the nanoassemblies P1-NP-pyr. The presence of these
bands confirms the successful encapsulation of pyrene within the nanoassemblies,
and the amount of chromophore measured is higher than the water solubility
of pyrene (0.67 × 10–6 M).29Figure 2f also shows that there is substantially more pyrene (almost twice)
within the polymer shell of the second batch compared to the first.
On the basis of the absorbance spectra and TGA, the average number
of pyrene chromophores within each batch of P1-NP-pyr can be estimated to be 30 for the first and 55 for the second.26 This difference in pyrene loading may contribute
to different fluorescent emission properties of the two batches as
explained below.

The emission spectra (λex =
335 nm) of aqueous
dispersions of both batches of P1-NP-pyr are shown in Figure 3, and they both show
the characteristic emission from a pyrene monomer that has a progression
of vibronic peaks. In the case of the first batch of the nanoassemblies,
the lack of a broad emission band between 450 and 550 nm where the
emission for the pyrene excimer typically appears suggests that the
encapsulated chromophores are not in close proximity to each other.17,30 This is not true for the second batch, and a weak excimer emission
in the spectrum can be seen in the inset in Figure 3b. This emission is only apparent when the
fluorescent spectrum is recorded shortly after the preparation of
the sample, and the excimer emission disappears after a period of
time (dotted line in Figure 3b). We attribute the presence of an excimer emission in the
case of the second batch to the higher average number of pyrenes residing
within the same volume of polymer shell as described previously. This
would result in a higher probability that two or more pyrenes will
be in close proximity. The fact that the excimer emission vanishes
after a period of time is strong evidence, showing that the chromophores
remain mobile within the polymeric shell rather than confined in one
location, and they relocate into different environments over time.

Figure 3 Normalized
(to 383 nm) fluorescence spectra (λex = 335 nm) for
aqueous dispersions of (a) first batch of P1-NP-pyr (1.6
× 10–6 M pyrene) and (b) second batch
of P1-NP-pyr (3.4 × 10–6 M pyrene).28 The dotted lines are the spectra measured after
a period of time (10 days for the first batch and 23 days for the
second). The excimer emission in the case of the second batch, which
disappears after a period of time, is shown in the inset. Any minor
shifts in the peak maxima (typically 2 nm or less) between both batches
can be attributed to a shift in the monochromator alignment and the
determination of spectra with different bandwidths.

Although the wavelengths at which the individual
bands appear in
the emission spectra of pyrene in water and encapsulated pyrene measured
with the same experimental conditions show only a small shift (Figure S3),31 the
relative intensities of bands I and III are different.26 The I/III ratio measured for an aqueous solution
of pyrene (0.5 μM) is 1.97 ± 0.0132 but drops to 1.26 ± 0.04 for batch 1 of P1-NP-pyr and 1.15 ± 0.03 for batch 2. These results indicate that on
average, pyrene must reside within a less polar environment than water,
which presumably is the polymeric shell surrounding the UCNPs. The
difference in the I/III ratios between the two batches of nanoassemblies
suggests that the pyrenes are partitioned in different environments
in each batch, and that there are either more pyrenes located in a
less polar environment in the second batch compared to the first,
or that batch 2 has more apolar environments than batch 1. At this
stage, it is important to appreciate that the steady-state emission
spectra in Figure 3 correspond to a weighted average of all of the pyrene chromophores
residing in their different environments, where the contribution is
greatest for the chromophores with the longest lifetimes. Time-resolved
experiments can provide more details as to the distribution of environments
as described below.

Time-resolved experiments on both batches
of the nanoassembly P1-NP-pyr show the presence of several
kinetic decay components
(Figure 4).26 Light scattering contributes to the decays as
a fast component following the excitation pulse. Control experiments
for P1-NP show an emission (Figure 4a) that in addition to the scattering can
be adequately fit with two exponentials that have lifetimes shorter
than 6 ns (Tables S1 and S2). Given the
fact that UCNPs only absorb around 975 nm,33 we attribute these two components to the fluorescence decay of impurities
trapped within the oleic acid ligand shell. The lifetimes for the
emission of the control are significantly shorter than that for pyrene
and are accounted for by fixing the values in the decay for P1-NP-pyr and by assuming that scattering follows the instrument
response function (IRF) of the system.26 In the analysis below, we focus only on the decay of the pyrene
emission. The fluorescence decays for both batches of the nanoassemblies
have two long-lived components (Figure 4b) with lifetimes assigned to the pyrene emission that
change upon storing the samples. When first measured, the lifetimes
for batch 1 are 60 ± 20 and 217 ± 6 ns with pre-exponential
factors of (14 ± 7) and (86 ± 8)% for the short and long
lifetimes, respectively. For batch 2, the initial lifetimes were 29
± 6 and 184 ± 3 ns with (30 ± 2) and (70 ± 2)%
pre-exponential factors, respectively. After 3 weeks of storage, the
measured lifetimes for batch 1 change to 89 ± 4 and 236 ±
1 ns, with the increased contribution of the shorter lifetime component
(25 ± 2)% [compared to (14 ± 7)% initially]. For batch 2,
the changes in lifetimes are smaller (34 ± 6 and 200 ± 4
ns after 3 weeks and 23 ± 4 and 213 ± 7 ns after 10 weeks)
and the change in pre-exponential factors takes longer to occur [(34
± 2) and (66 ± 2)% after 3 weeks and (55 ± 3) and (45
± 3)% after 10 weeks] for the short and long lifetimes, respectively
(Tables S1 and S2). This result emphasizes
the need to perform time-resolved experiments in conjunction with
steady-state ones as the I/III ratio is a composite value reflecting
a weighted average when pyrenes are located in more than one environment.

Figure 4 Fluorescence
decays (black) of aqueous dispersions for (a) P1-Np control
experiment and (b) first batch (1.6 × 10–6 M)28 of P1-NP-pyr monitored at 400 nm
(λex = 335 nm). The fitting
curves (red lines), instrument response function (IRF) (blue line),
and residuals between the calculated and experimental data (lower
panel) are also shown. No IRF is shown for the P1-NP-pyr emission (b) because it is narrow on this time window.

Although the actual lifetimes from both batches
of P1-NP-pyr are different, the fact that two pyrene
fluorescence lifetimes are
recovered from the fit of the decays in both cases indicates that
the pyrene chromophores are located in at least two different environments
with different properties. We are not able to differentiate between
environments where excited pyrene has similar lifetimes. The presence
of more than two environments, but with similar properties, is supported
by the change in the absolute values of the lifetimes over time. Therefore,
the analysis of the lifetime data is made at a qualitative level where
two different binding regions exist, one with short lifetimes (20–90
ns) and a second one where excited pyrene has longer lifetimes (180–240
ns) than that in water (130 ns).

We do not believe that the
lifetimes measured correspond to pyrene
leaking out of the nanoassemblies as supported by the fact that when
an aqueous dispersion of P1-NP-pyr is centrifuged, no
emission can be detected from the supernatant, showing that it is
unlikely that any of the two lifetimes recovered from the emission
decay is due to “free” pyrene. Therefore, the two lifetimes
observed correspond to pyrene in different environments within P-NP-pyr. The different lifetimes and pre-exponential factors
obtained for two different batches are likely related to the different
loadings of pyrene of the nanoparticles. Although a concentration
dependence study of pyrene loading of the nanoparticles is beyond
the objective of this study, the variability of the photophysical
parameters for the pyrene emission shows that different distributions
of small molecule loading of the nanosystem occur, which are not apparent
from usual characterization of the system with TEM and DLS.

The lifetime for pyrene in aerated water is reported to be 130
ns.34,35 In our measurements, the calculated lifetimes
are longer, indicating that some pyrenes are located in a less polar
environment than water, which is presumably within the organic polymeric
shell, and this assumption is in agreement with the lower I/III ratios
determined from our steady-state fluorescent measurements. The shorter
lifetimes (60 ± 20 and 29 ± 6 ns) may be attributed to the
fact that some pyrenes are in close proximity to the UCNP surface,
resulting in energy-transfer processes that could partially quench
the pyrene emission.36,37 These results support the proposed
cartoon structure of the nanoassembly shown in Figure 1. The less polar environment where pyrenes
are encapsulated is provided by the hydrophobic chains of the amphiphilic
polymer, and the oleic acid ligands coating UCNPs, leading to both
shorter and longer lifetime components. The hydrophilic mPEG outer
layer renders the nanosystem water-dispersible, and the amphiphilic
polymeric shell projects water out to maintain a hydrophobic environment
inside the shell for photochemistries to happen. It should be noted
that the I/III ratio is not sufficiently low to eliminate the possibility
that some pyrenes could be located in this outer layer, which is more
polar than the inner layers.

The increased contributions of
the shorter lifetimes (60 ±
20 and 29 ± 6 ns) after storage suggest that the pyrenes are
gradually migrating within the polymeric shell to locations closer
to the nanoparticle surface, where the pyrene fluorescence is partially
quenched. This behavior also explains why the excimer emission can
be observed in batch 2 of the nanoassembly initially but eventually
disappears after stored at ambient condition for several days. This
molecular migration phenomenon makes our nanosystem a very interesting
candidate for nanoreactors because one can imagine that performing
photochemistry in these nanoreactors (of which partition molecules
from bulk environment but still allow partial molecular freedom) will
be different compared to performing photochemistry in free solution
and in strictly confined solid crystalline structures.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the emissive
characteristics
of pyrene chromophores are useful to probe the nature of the local
environments within the amphiphilic layer of the polymer-encapsulated
UCNP nanosystem. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy
suggest the presence of different local environments in the polymeric
shell, which are less polar than water and where the organic pyrene
chromophores can reside. This explains why we7,9 and
others38 have previously demonstrated that
photoresponsive molecules retain their phototactivity in similar nanoassemblies
even though the entire system is in water. We also observe the migration
of the pyrene chromophores within the polymeric shell, and this property
of the polymeric shell makes the nanoassembly a very interesting candidate
for nanoreactors because the mobility of reagents can be exploited
to control bimolecular reactivity. The work presented here should
help in guiding the design of future generation nanoreactors and drug
delivery vehicles, which have the potential to convert water-insoluble
reagents or prodrugs into water-soluble products and drugs using UCNPs
and photochemistry.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
4.1.1 General
Pyrene
was purchased from
Aldrich and was recrystallized twice from a solvent mixture of EtOH/H2O (9:1) before being used in encapsulation experiments. The
purity of pyrene was checked by time-resolved fluorescence experiments
(λex = 335 nm, λem = 383 and 395
nm) for a 0.5 μM pyrene solution in aerated water, where a monoexponential
decay (133–135 ns) was observed. Poly(propylene glycol)bis(2-aminopropyl
ether) (JEFFAMINE 2070) was received as a gift from Huntsman Inc.
Cumene-terminated PSMA was purchased from Aldrich. Methanol (99.9%,
spectro analyzed for use in UV range, Fisher Scientific) and ethanol
(95%, Commercial Alcohols) were used as received, and aqueous solutions
were prepared with deionized water (≥17.8 MΩ cm, Sybron
Barnstead System).

4.1.2 Transmission Electron
Microscopy
TEM images were obtained using a Tecnai Osiris
scanning transmission
electron microscope operating at 200 keV. For the nanoparticles dispersed
in CHCl3, a small amount of this dispersion was drop-cast
on a carbon formvar-coated copper grid (400 mesh, Ted Pella, part
# 01814-F) and air-dried before imaging. For samples dispersed in
water, dilute colloids of the nanoparticles dispersed in water (5
μL) were placed on thin, carbon formvar-coated copper grids
held by anticapillary tweezers (400 mesh, Ted Pella, part # 01814-F).
Water was then slowly removed under reduced pressure overnight in
a vacuum desiccator. For the uranyl acetate staining, the dried grid
with an aqueous sample on it was held with anticapillary tweezers
and a drop (5 μL) of saturated uranyl acetate aqueous solution
was drop-casted onto the grid. A piece of absorbent tissue was placed
underneath and in contact with the grid to adsorb extra uranyl acetate
solution. Another drop (5 μL) of deionized water was placed
on the grid, and again kimwipe was used to absorb the extra. The sample
was then left in air for 5 min and used directly for imaging. The
shape and size of the NaYF4:ErYb nanoparticles and nanoassemblies
were evaluated from the collected TEM images.

4.1.3 Dynamic Light Scattering
DLS measurements
were carried out using Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS. The colloidal samples
were held in a 10 mm path length plastic cuvette (BrandTech, Catalog
# 759220). A nanoparticle concentration of ∼1 mg/mL was employed
for the measurements.a DLS measurements were
conducted at 25 °C.

4.1.4 Thermogravimetric Analysis
A typical
TGA sample was prepared by removing an aliquot amount (1 mL) of the
aqueous dispersion using a pipette to a clean scintillation vial and
drying it under high vacuum at room temperature. When the sample was
completely dry, the residue was dissolved in minimum amount of CHCl3 and the solution was carefully transferred into the TGA heating
pan, at which time the solution was completely evaporated in air before
the TGA experiment was started. The TGA experiment was performed on
a Shimadzu TGA-50 analyzer. The weight loss was analyzed by heating
the sample from room temperature to 500 °C at the rate of 5 °C/min.

4.1.5 Optical Spectroscopy Sample Preparation
Concentrated pyrene stock solutions (∼1 mM) were prepared
in methanol, and this stock solution was injected into deionized water
to make solutions of 0.5 μM. The nanoassembly samples were used
as prepared. All measurements were done in aerated solutions.

4.1.6 Synthesis of β-NaYF4: 2
mol % Er3+, 20 mol % Yb3+ Nanoparticles (NaYF4:ErYb)
In a typical synthesis, Y(CH3CO2)3 (3.9 mmol), Yb(CH3CO2)3 (1.0 mmol), and Er(CH3CO2)3 (0.1 mmol) were added to a 100 mL three-neck round-bottom flask
containing 75 mL of octadecene and 30 mL of oleic acid. The solution
was stirred magnetically and heated slowly to 120 °C under vacuum
for 30 min to form the lanthanide oleate complexes and to remove residual
water and oxygen. The temperature was then lowered to 50 °C,
and the reaction flask was placed under a gentle flow of nitrogen
gas. During this time, a solution of ammonium fluoride (0.74 g, 20
mmol) and sodium hydroxide (0.50 g, 12.5 mmol) dissolved in methanol
(50 mL) was prepared via sonication. Once the reaction reached 50
°C, the methanol solution was added to the reaction flask and
the resulting cloudy mixture was stirred for 30 min at 50 °C.
The reaction temperature was then increased to 70 °C, and the
methanol evaporated from the reaction mixture. Subsequently, the reaction
temperature was increased to 300 °C as quickly as possible and
maintained at this temperature for 60 min under the nitrogen gas flow.
During this time, the reaction mixture became progressively clearer
until a completely clear, slightly yellowish solution was obtained.
The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. The nanoparticles
were precipitated by the addition of ethanol and isolated via centrifugation
at 4500 rpm corresponding to a relative centrifugal field (RCF) of
approximately 1000. The resulting pellet was dispersed in a minimal
amount of hexanes and precipitated with excess ethanol. The nanoparticles
were isolated via centrifugation at 4500 rpm and then dispersed in
chloroform for subsequent experiments.

4.1.7 Synthesis
of Hybrid Nanoassembly without
Pyrene (P1-NP)
A stirring solution of cumene-terminated
PSMA (25 mg, 0.016 mmol, Mn = 1700) in
CHCl3 (1 mL) was treated with JEFFAMINE 2070 (160 mg, 0.016
mmol, Mn = 2070) in CHCl3 (1.0
mL), and the solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. The
reaction mixture was then treated with a solution of the oleate-coated
UCNPs (NaYF4:ErYb) in CHCl3 (250 μL, 42
mg/mL)a and stirred for 1 h. The reaction mixture
was evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator. The oily residue
was treated with aqueous NaOH (3 mL, 0.01 M, pH 12) and sonicated
for 5 min, and any trace amounts of CHCl3 were carefully
removed using a rotary evaporator to afford a clear aqueous solution.
This solution was transferred using a pipette into two 1.5 mL conical
centrifugation tubes and centrifuged at 20 600 RCF for 25 min.
The supernatant was removed from the pellets of nanoparticles using
a pipette, and the pellets were redispersed in deionized water (3
mL for each sample) with the help of sonication. The tubes were centrifuged
for 25 min at 20 600 RCF, and the supernatant was removed from
the pellets of nanoparticles using a pipette. The nanoparticles were
redispersed in deionized water (3 mL for each sample) with the help
of sonication; the two samples were combined and passed through a
0.2 μm filter (Acrodisc syringe filter) to obtain the final
stock solution of encapsulated nanoparticles for further characterization.

4.1.8 Synthesis of Hybrid Nanoassembly with Pyrene
(P1-NP-pyr, Two Batches)
A stirring solution
of cumene-terminated PSMA (25 mg, 0.016 mmol, Mn = 1700) in CHCl3 (1 mL) was treated with JEFFAMINE
2070 (160 mg, 0.016 mmol, Mn = 2070) in
CHCl3 (1.0 mL), and the solution was stirred overnight
at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then treated with a
solution of the oleate-coated UCNPs (NaYF4:ErYb) in CHCl3 (250 μL, 42 mg/mL)2 and a stock solution
of pyrene in CHCl3 (1.4 × 10–3 M,
71 μL, 1 × 10–7 mol) and stirred for
1 h. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness using a rotary
evaporator. The oily residue was treated with aqueous NaOH (3 mL,
0.01 M, pH 12) and sonicated for 5 min, and any trace amounts of CHCl3 were carefully removed using a rotary evaporator to afford
a clear aqueous solution. This solution was transferred using a pipette
into two 1.5 mL conical centrifugation tubes and centrifuged at 20 600
RCF for 25 min. The supernatant was removed from the pellets of nanoparticles
using a pipette, and the pellets were redispersed in deionized water
(3 mL for each sample) with the help of sonication. The tubes were
centrifuged for 25 min at 20 600 RCF, and the supernatant was
removed from the pellets of nanoparticles using a pipette. The nanoparticles
were redispersed in deionized water (3 mL for each sample) with the
help of sonication; the two samples were combined and passed through
a 0.2 μm filter (Acrodisc syringe filter) to obtain the final
stock solution of encapsulated nanoparticles for further characterization.

4.1.9 Optical Spectroscopy
UV–vis
spectra were recorded from 200–800 nm using Varian Cary 1 or
Cary 100 spectrometers. Steady-state fluorescence emission spectra
were collected using a PTI QM-40 fluorimeter. Emission spectra were
recorded between 350 and 500 nm or 350–550 nm if excimer emission
was observed, at excitation wavelengths of 331 or 335 nm. The step
size was 0.25 nm, the integration time was 0.5 s, and the slits for
both monochromators were set to either 1 or 2 nm bandwidths. The time-resolved
emission decays were collected using an Edinburgh Instruments OB920
single photon counter. Samples were excited at 335 nm using an EPLED-330
light-emitting diode, and the emission decays were recorded at 400
nm. The emission monochromator slits were set to a bandwidth of 16
nm. The IRF was collected by recording the scattering of silica in
a dilute LUDOX (Aldrich) solution and setting the emission wavelength
to 335 nm to match the wavelength of the LED. Fluorescence experiments
were carried out at 20 °C. The pyrene purity experiments were
measured in 10 × 10 mm quartz cells, and 2 × 10 mm quartz
cells were used for the UCNP experiments. For the latter, the cell
faced the excitation beam so that the sample was irradiated through
the 10 mm path length.

4.1.10 Data Fitting
The fluorescence
decays were fit to a sum of exponentials (eq 1), and the quality of the fits was judged
by the χ2 values (0.9–1.2), and the randomness
of the residuals. 1  

Each fluorescent
species has an associated
lifetime (τi) and a pre-exponential
factor (Ai), where the
sum of the Ai values
is unity. Reconvolution with the IRF was employed when analyzing the
decay for the emission of the UCNP sample in the absence of pyrene,
whereas a tail fit was used for the fit of the decay collected over
longer time windows when pyrene was present because the excitation
pulse is narrow for these experiments.

The values for the
average sizes were obtained
directly from the DLS instrument using Malvern General Purpose &
Multiple Narrow Mode NNLS (non-negative least squares) algorithm to
treat the autocorrelation equation of the intensity trace describing
sample intensity fluctuation recorded during the experiment.


These values are the total concentrations
of pyrene encapsulated in the nanoassemblies obtained using the absorption
of pyrene as measured by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy (λ
= 335 nm) divided by the molar absorptivity of pyrene in acetonitrile
(38 704 M–1 cm–1), calculated
from the data obtained in this study (see Supporting Information for details). The assumption is that the molar
absorptivity of pyrene in acetonitrile is similar to that for pyrene
in the nanoassembly.

The I/III ratio depends
on the resolution of the spectra, which is determined by the bandwidth
of the emission monochromator. On the instrument used, a value close
to 1.97 was obtained. For detailed discussion on experimental artifacts,
