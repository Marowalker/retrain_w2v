The
thermodynamic properties of hydrophobic hydration processes
have been analyzed and assessed. The thermodynamic binding functions
result to be related to each other by the mathematical relationships
of an ergodic algorithmic model (EAM). The active dilution dA of species A in solution is expressed as dA = 1/(Φ·xA) with thermal factor Φ = T–(Cp,A/R) and (1/xA) = did(A), where did(A) = ideal dilution.
Entropy function is set as S = f(did(A),T). Thermal
change of entropy (i.e., entropy intensity change) is represented
by the equation (dS)d = Cp dln T. Configuration change of entropy (i.e., entropy density change)
is represented by the equation (dS)T =
(−R dln xA)T = (R dln did(A))T. Because
every logarithmic function in thermodynamic space corresponds to an
exponential function in probability space, the sum functions ΔHdual = (ΔHmot + ΔHth) and ΔSdual = (ΔSmot + ΔSth) of the thermodynamic space give birth, in
exponential probability space, to a dual-structure partition function
{DS-PF}: exp(−ΔGdual/RT) = Kdual = (Kmot·ζth) = {(exp(−ΔHmot/RT))(exp(ΔSmot/R))}·{exp(−ΔHth/RT) exp(ΔSth/R)}. Every hydrophobic hydration process
can be represented by {DS-PF} = {M-PF}·{T-PF}, indicating biphasic systems. {M-PF} = f(T,did(A)), concerning the solute, is monocentric and produces
changes of entropy density, contributing to free energy −ΔGmot, whereas {T-PF} = g(T), concerning the solvent,
produces changes of entropy intensity, not contributing to free energy.
Entropy density and entropy intensity are equivalent and summed with
each other (i.e., they are ergodic). From the dual-structure partition
function {DS-PF}, the ergodic algorithmic
model (EAM) can be developed. The model EAM consists of a set of mathematical
relationships, generating parabolic convoluted binding functions R ln Kdual = −ΔGdual/T = {f(1/T)*g(T)} and RT ln Kdual =
−ΔGdual = {f(T)*g(ln T)}. The first function in each convoluted couple f(1/T) or f(T)
is generated by {M-PF}, whereas the
second function, g(T) or g(ln T), respectively, is generated
by {T-PF}. The mathematical properties
of the thermodynamic functions of hydrophobic hydration processes,
experimentally determined, correspond to the geometrical properties
of parabolas, with constant curvature amplitude Campl = 0.7071/ΔCp,hydr. The dual structure of the partition function conforms
to the biphasic composition of every hydrophobic hydration solution,
consisting of a diluted solution, with solvent in excess at constant
potential.

1 Introduction
In 1980, Lumry1 proposed to consider
the thermodynamic functions enthalpy and entropy in biochemical reactions
as divided into two parts, namely, thermal (or compensative) and motive
(or work) functions, respectively. Moreover, Lumry regretted that
very rarely the dual nature of water had been considered in biochemical
equilibria. Lumry2 observed that enthalpy,
entropy, and volume data obtained for processes studied in aqueous
solvent generally have been assumed to apply to a solute process,
without consideration of the coupling between the process and the
two-state equilibrium of water. It followed then that significant
chemistry knowledge deduced from reactions in aqueous media may be
wrong. Most free-energy information is likely to remain uncomplicated,
but enthalpy, internal energy, entropy, and volume data are generally
suspected, since have they been rarely analyzed as to take the two
species of water into account. Another point touched by Lumry, again
about biochemical equilibria in aqueous solvents, concerned the peculiar
properties of the thermodynamic functions enthalpy and entropy. Lumry
recommended to consider enthalpy and entropy as composed of two parts
each, thermal and motive. Lumry,2 however,
stated that thermal and motive parts of enthalpy and entropy were
not usually experimentally determinable. Lumry much appreciated also
the property observed by Benzinger,3 supported
by Lee and Graziano,4 that some of the
components of the thermodynamic functions compensate each other and
do not contribute to free energy.

We have been studying5−8 for the last 10 years the thermodynamic properties
of the hydrophobic hydration processes, including the reactions of
protein denaturation and micelle formation, specifically considered
by Lumry. In contrast, however, with the pessimistic opinion expressed
by Lumry, we have succeeded to calculate numerically thermal and motive
components of enthalpy and entropy in every one of the many hydrophobic
processes examined, by taking advantage of constant hydrophobic heat
capacity ΔCp,hydr. By assuming that water is composed of cluster WI, cluster (iceberg) WII,
and free molecules WIII, we have built
up a molecular model for hydrophobic hydration processes that yields
very significant self-consistent results, notwithstanding that the
experimental data are referred to apparently different processes,
from protonation of carboxylato anions and noble gas solubility in
water to protein denaturation, micelle formation, and many others.
Several points will be addressed:(i) Dual-structure partition function
{DS-PF} = {M-PF}·{T-PF} is indicative
of the biphasic structure of every hydrophobic hydration system, with
the motive function {M-PF} = f(T,did(A))
referred to the reacting solute and the thermal function {T-PF} = g(T) referred to the excess solvent, respectively.

(ii) Dual-structure partition function
{DS-PF} is valid for every hydrophobic
hydration system.

(iii) Hydrophobic heat capacity ΔCp,hydr is constant in each
compound, independent of T.

(iv) Thermal free energy (−ΔGth/T) referred to {T-PF} is invariably zero.

(v) The second law of thermodynamics is
related to both entropy intensity and entropy density.

(vi) Every dual-structure partition function
of probability space generates, in thermodynamic space, parabolic
convoluted binding functions R ln Kdual = (−ΔGdual/T) = {f(1/T)*g(T)} and RT ln Kdual = (−ΔGdual) = {f(T)*g(ln T)}, constituting
an ergodic algorithmic model (EAM). In consequence, constant hydrophobic
heat capacity ΔCp,hydr, which is inversely proportional to the geometrical constant curvature
amplitude Campl (Campl = 0.7071/ΔCp,hydr) of both parabolic binding functions, results to be an
invariable property of every hydrophobic hydration process.

(vii) Condition of null thermal
free energy
(−ΔGth/T = 0) is an invariable property of the thermal partition function
{T-PF}, which is referred to a large
statistical molecule population (solvent) and can be treated by methods
of statistical thermodynamics.

(viii) Motive partition function {M-PF}
is monocentric, with linear van’t
Hoff equation (−ΔGmot/T) = f(1/T) in thermodynamic
space, as in any normal monophasic system with constant Kmot. The partition function {M-PF}, being referred to an ensemble composed by very few elements
(moles, solute) ruled by binomial distribution, cannot be treated
by methods of statistical thermodynamics.

(ix) Consistency or inconsistency of ergodic
algorithmic model (EAM) with computer simulations of free-energy functions
is discussed. Computer simulations concerning the dual-structure partition
function {DS-PF} requires necessarily
the introduction of quasi-chemical approximations,9 associating molecule statistical distributions of {T-PF} to mole binomial distribution of {M-PF}. The potential distribution theorem (PDT),9 which is referred to a nonexistent monophasic
system, is inconsistent with the ergodic algorithmic model (EAM).

(x) The essential reaction
of the hydrophobic
effect is, in class A, the reaction of iceberg formation with phase
transition

  whereas in class B, the reaction,
with opposite
phase transition, is  with iceberg reduction. It is worth mentioning
that the processes of iceberg formation in class A and iceberg reduction
in class B, taking place in the solvent, with reduction or increment
of solvent volume, respectively, produce changes in the thermodynamic
properties of the solute.

This manuscript is the first part
of the three-part study of hydrophobic
hydration processes:I. Dual-structure partition function for
biphasic aqueous systems.

II. Entropy density and entropy intensity:
ergodic algorithmic model (EAM).

III. Validation of (EAM) model.



In Part II, the molecular interpretation of the entropy intensity
changes and of the entropy density changes is discussed. The variability
of entropy density is bound, at constant temperature T, to changes of ideal dilution did(A) = 1/xA multiplied by the thermal factor
= f(τm2) = T–(Cp,A/R). The thermal factor represents, at constant temperature,
the thermal energy associated with each molecule. τm2 represents the squared mean sojourn time of each molecule.
Sojourn time is the time spent by each molecule to run 1 length unit.
The variability of entropy intensity is bound to changes of velocity
of the molecules, produced by changes of temperature, through the
same thermal factor, in systems, like as a pure liquid, whereby no
concentration change is possible. Both processes, variation of entropy
density and variation of entropy intensity, produce changes of energy
dispersal, i.e., changes of entropy. The connections of EAM with computer
simulations will be discussed. Computer simulations will be conditioned
by the molar reactions taking place in every hydrophobic hydration
process.

In Part III, the analysis is extended to a large population
of
compounds of very different size and very different molecular structure.
The statistical analysis over a population of about 80 compounds with
about 600 experimental points has confirmed that EAM is valid in every
hydrophobic hydration process, leading to unitary values of entropy
change and enthalpy change, with variability at the limit of the experimental
error. Statistical validation states the general applicability of
EAM and indicates that the same properties of hydrophobic hydration
process will be found in every such process taking place in biological
ambient and in every process of drug design.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Dilution, Thermal Energy
Dispersal, and Entropy
For statistical thermodynamics, the
number of possible locations
(configurations) for a solute molecule in the whole solution volume
is a measure of the state probability of that solute. The larger the
number of possible locations, the larger the solvent volume. The state
probability of a solute, therefore, is proportional to the volume
in which the solute is dissolved, i.e., to solute dilution. The identification
of solvent-to-solute ratio (dilution) as homologous with configuration
multiplicity is an important connection to statistical thermodynamics.
A basic statistical setting is the relationship between state multiplicity,
state probability, and entropy density. If we suppose to subdivide
the solvent into many submicroscopic cells, we can consider each cell
as a possible location for a solute molecule. The larger the number
of accessible cells, the more probable a molecule can find a cell
for location. The cell multiplicity, therefore (expressed as the number
of solvent molecules per solute unit), identifies the statistical
state probability Ω, calculated by Boltzmann equation 1  In a solution, the number
of available cells
is directly proportional to dilution (expressed as solvent-to-solute
ratio): consequently, dilution, which is a number expressing the dispersion
of solute molecules, is also homologous with the number expressing
statistical state probability Ω. If the concentration cA is expressed in molar fraction (solute-to-solvent
ratio), its reciprocal, ideal calculated dilution did(A) = 1/xA, represents the
solvent-to-solute ratio. Ideal dilution did(A), therefore, which is a parameter of matter dispersion, corresponds
to an exponential probability factor in probability space 2  whereby we show how ideal dilution did(A) is an exponential function homologous
with statistical state probability Ω of statistical thermodynamics
of eq 1.

The molecules,
however, tend to disperse over all of the available accessible microcells,
stirred by thermal energy in such a way that the molecules carry thermal
energy to every available accessible microcell. This point has been
stressed by Lambert10 who has launched
a campaign to inform students that using the simple numerical probability
without any mention of energetic involvement might be misleading.
Lambert speaks of energetic “enablement”. The energetic
involvement recommended by Lambert is essential to obtain any entropy
change from matter dispersion change.

Regarding this energetic
involvement, we can recall an analogy.
If we let a drop of purple solute fall into a colorless liquid solvent,
the thermal energy will bring the solute molecules to disperse all
over the whole volume of the solvent, thus obtaining a pale pink color.
Suppose that energy identifies with a purple layer covering each molecule:
the color is dispersed all over the solvent volume. Dispersion of
energy is analogous to dispersion of color. With dispersion of energy
measured by the thermodynamic function entropy density Sdens, we can suppose Sdens to be inversely proportional to the intensity of the solution color.
For the moving solute molecules, every microcell of solvent is potentially
a location. Each solute molecule, however, carries with it a portion
of thermal energy, supposed to be purple, in such a way that dispersion
of matter measured by ideal dilution did(A) = 1/xA becomes at the same time dispersion
of “purple red” energy, i.e., entropy density. Without
thermal agitation, the purple solute molecules would have been resting
at the initial point, so the same resting would have occurred for
energy, and as a consequence, we could not observe any entropy density
change. The dispersion of matter did(A), therefore, is proportional to a change of entropy density in the
thermodynamic space: we can write, at constant temperature, the entropy
density differential 3  We can
introduce the energetic “enablement”
recommended by Lambert by substituting the concentration xA by activity aA, where aA = Φ·xA. The Lambert’s thermal energy factor (THEF, with Φ
= T–(Cp,A/R)) representing the energetic involvement
recommended by Lambert’s is a measure of the thermal energy,
supposed to be “purple red”, associated with each molecule.
THEF is a source of ergodicity of the chemical systems. The ideal
dilution did(A) = 1/xA is transformed into the active dilution dA = 1/aA: the reciprocal factor
(1/Φ), therefore, transforms the parameter of matter dispersion did(A) = 1/xA into
the parameter of energy dispersion dA =
1/aA and hence into an entropy parameter.
We can consider that the entropy Sdens can be expressed as the function of activity of A as 4  The active dilution dA can be set 5  and the differential of
entropy can be rewritten
as 6  By developing eq 6, we obtain 7  The two terms of eq 7, representing entropy
density and entropy
intensity differential changes, respectively, are related to the changes
of energy dispersion at molecular level: the first term indicates
the change of energy dispersion in space, i.e., change of entropy
density, whereas the second term corresponds to the change of energy
dispersion in time, i.e., change of entropy intensity, respectively
(see Part II, Section 2, for molecular interpretations of entropy
density and entropy intensity).

Equation 7 implies
the formulation of the entropy function, bound to an extended second
law of thermodynamics (see Appendix A). The
reappraisal of the traditional formulation of the second law is necessary
because the usual expression of the second law, with condition to
entropy, dS = δrevQp/T ≥ 0 (being δrevQp/T = Cp dT/T = Cp dln T ≥ 0), is inadequate. It is, in fact, clearly referred to
the only thermal entropy change, or entropy intensity change due to
heat transfer, in conformity with Clausius’ definition of the
second law. The existence of the configuration entropy changes or
entropy density changes requires the extension of the validity of
the second law. Entropy intensity and entropy density are equivalent
(ergodic) and are summed up or subtracted to each other.

At
constant temperature (dln T = 0), the
entropy change reduces to eq 3, but we have to remind the reader that the reciprocal THEF
(1/Φ ≠ 1) is implicitly active, even if constant for
[∂(1/Φ)/∂T]T = 0. In such isothermal conditions, the variation of entropy density
as a function of ideal dilution ln did(A) = ln(1/xA) can be measured by experimental
determinations of variations of xA: every
potentiometer or pH meter, in fact, becomes, at constant temperature,
an effective entropy density meter. Entropy, therefore, is a function
of ideal calculated dilution did(A), which
is homologous, at constant temperature, with state probability.

We can now search for other functions homologous with state probability
and dependent on dilution. To endeavor these functions, we recall
the Boltzmann equation for statistical ensemble 8  where Ω is a partition function referred
to an ensemble of molecules as the function of kB = 1.3806 × 10–23 J K–1. The number Ω is an extremely large quantity calculated by
statistical mechanics methods and not accessible by experiment. We
calculate the Nth root of Ω (N is Avogadro number: NAv = 6.022 ×
1023) and transform Ω into the partition function ZM referred to a population of moles as the function
of R (R = 8.31451 J K–1 mol–1) 9  where ZM is a
molar partition function.aZM is, in principle, experimentally accessible, being on
mole chemical scale. By differentiation, we obtain 10  at constant T, whereby we
put in evidence, in comparison to eq 3, the parallelism between entropy density, logarithm
of partition function, and logarithm of ideal dilution.

At the
same time, however, this is the point strongly supported
by Lambert:10 dilution is a measure of
energy dispersion (i.e., energy dispersion (or energy dilution) means
entropy concentration) because the molecules, moved by thermal energy,
represented by the factor (1/Φ) (reciprocal THEF) in eq 5, tend to spread over every
accessible solvent cell, thus changing dilution. This process goes
on until it reaches the minimum concentration and consequently the
maximum dilution compatible with the system conditions. In such a
way, dilution from parameter of matter dispersion becomes a parameter
of energy dispersion, i.e., a parameter of entropy density. Lambert
regrets that statistical thermodynamic authors insist on the probabilistic
aspect of multiplicity without any mention of energy involvement.
We have shown above how the energy “enablement” of configuration
entropy, as suggested by Lambert, can be explained by introducing
the reciprocal of energetic factor THEF (1/Φ = T(Cp,A/R)), multiplying the ideal calculated dilution did(A). In contrast, pure thermal changes of entropy intensity
can be observed whenever heat dispersion in time, due to changed velocity
of the molecules, takes place even without any concentration change
((1/xA) = 1 in eq 6), as for example in a solvent or in a pure
nonreacting liquid. For the solvent or a pure liquid, in fact, it
is constitutionally impossible to define a concentration change. In
these systems, therefore, we can observe changes of entropy intensity
only.

2.2 Configuration Change of Entropy: Entropy Density
Being on search for thermodynamic functions depending on dilution,
which is homologous with configuration, we have analyzed the formation
constant of the equilibrium A + B = AB 11  By considering that did(A) = 1/xA, did(B) = 1/xB, and did(AB) =
1/cAB,
the formation constant can be rewritten as a ratio of ideal dilutions 12  with clear connection to
the settings of statistical
thermodynamics, whereby the configurations as state probability are
homologous with ideal calculated dilutions. It is worth noting, in
fact, that if the concentration is expressed in molar fraction, the
ideal dilution did(A) = (1/xA) represents the molar (solvent-to-solute) ratio. The
dilution is homologous with the statistical partition function Ω,
which represents the molecular (solvent-to-solute) ratio. By calculating
the logarithm R ln K at temperature T, we move from probability space
(K) to thermodynamic space 13  and by recalling
that for component A 14  and so on for other terms,
we can write 15  showing that (R ln K)T, being formed by a sum of
entropy density terms, is itself an entropic function. The character
of total entropy density of R ln K = (−ΔG°/T) conforms to the statement of statistical thermodynamics that, according
to the second law of thermodynamics, a system assumes the configuration
of maximum entropy, at thermodynamic equilibrium. This state probability,
in fact, maximizes the discrete Gibbs entropy.

In general terms,
ln K is a specific value of a general equilibrium
quotient ln QK. By considering
that R  dln did(B) ∼ R  dln did(AB), the differential of equilibrium quotient QK can be expressed as 16  A change of QK corresponds, therefore,
at constant temperature, to a change of
dilution and hence to a change of entropy density. The partition function
in probability space is homologous with dilution. The logarithm of
equilibrium quotient, the logarithm of the partition function, and
the logarithm of equilibrium constant can be reported along the dilution
axis in the diagram (Figure 1), where we report the vector representation of Gibbs equation
in thermodynamic space. In this diagram, we report the configuration
(dilution) change of entropy (entropy density) on the abscissa axis
and the thermal change of entropy (entropy intensity) on the ordinate
axis.

projection of (−ΔG°/T) on z axis: −ΔΓØ/T = (−ΔG°/T) cos(π/4).

The next function analyzed has been the chemical potential
(partial
molar function) 17  a function introduced to represent the dependence
of free energy from concentration of each reactant 18  with xA the concentration
of A, in molar fraction.b

For a given
temperature, a molecule has a higher chemical potential
in a high concentration sector and a lower chemical potential in a
low concentration sector. 19  after differentiation 20  and with sign changed,
we obtain 21  This equation shows how the differential d(−μ/T) also is a configuration change of entropy density and
can be reported on the dilution axis of the diagram in Figure 1.

The Gibbs equation,
referred to a monocentric partition function,
is represented in Figure 1 as a vector (bold type) composition 22  The reaction is assumed to be exothermic (ΔHØ < 0). We note that
{−ΔHØ/T} (thermal entropy intensity) is by construction
necessarily equal to ΔSH (change of entropy density) 23  Both are, in fact, legs of an isosceles right
triangle. The equivalence demonstrates the ergodic property of the
thermodynamic system. In fact, eq 23 states that an enthalpy divided by temperature T (i.e., entropy intensity) is transformed by projection
onto the dilution axis into a configuration change of entropy (i.e.,
entropy density). Thus, we find on the x axis a total
change of entropy density vector ΔSTOT = −ΔGØ/T, which represents the
sum of the entropy vectors ΔSH (entropy density equivalent to entropy intensity) and ΔSØ (change of entropy density) 24  This vector can also be
represented along
dilution axis as entropy density function ((dS)T ≡ (dSdens)). Every configuration change of entropy or change of entropy density
in reacting mole ensembles (REMEs)c can be reported,
as dilution-equivalent on x axis (Table 1). We want, however, to stress
once again the point that the dilution differential R  dln dA is actually
enabled to represent dispersion of energy, as a change of entropy
density, only because the ideal calculated dilution did(A) is associated with the active dilution d(A) to the reciprocal thermal factor THEF (1/Φ = T(Cp,A/R)) (cf. eq 5).

One special
point is worth noting, concerning the diagram in Figure 1 and van’t
Hoff function. By determining the equilibrium constant R ln K at different temperatures for
any kind of reaction, we measure in any case changes of entropy density,
which can be reported on dilution axis. Then, by calculating the derivative
∂(R ln K)/∂(1/T) for these configuration data (van’t Hoff equation),
we “calculate” the molar enthalpy ΔHØ. In a general regular reaction, the derivative
∂(R ln K)/∂(1/T) is a constant ΔHØ. In hydrophobic reactions, we obtain the experimental enthalpy ΔHdual that varies following a straight line as
in eq 31. In any case,
ΔH/T is an entropy intensity:
this means that, by applying van’t Hoff equation, we calculate
entropy intensity changes from measurements of entropy density. If,
in a different experiment on the same reaction, we employ a calorimeter
to measure reaction enthalpy and obtain an experimental value of molar
enthalpy ΔHØ or ΔHdual equal to that previously “calculated”
from concentration (i.e., configuration) determinations (cf. eq 23). This result is possible
because of the ergodic properties of the thermodynamic systems (cf.
Part II, Section 223). The ergodic condition
defines the equivalence between energy dispersion in time, or entropy
intensity, due to temperature T and hence velocity
of molecules, and energy dispersion in space, or entropy density,
due to dilution d.

The correspondence of the
enthalpy term (−ΔHØ/T) or entropy intensity
term in Gibbs equation with a change of entropy density term labeled
ΔSH can be explained. The entropy
term ΔSØ can be calculated
as 25  where Tmax is
the temperature at which (−ΔHØ/T) → 0, obtainable by extrapolation
to (1/T) = 0 of van’t Hoff equation. According
to the second law and Carnot cycle, the term (−ΔHØ/T) represents
thermal entropy transferred to the environment in an irreversible
process. Within Gibbs equation, however, the thermal entropy term
(−ΔHØ/T) is transformed and measured as an equivalent configuration
entropy density term 26  This entropy density
term ΔSH is increasing when the
temperature is decreasing, with
the consequence that the equilibrium constant R ln K, which is an entropy density function, is increasing at
low temperature. Hence the total entropy is increasing as well. Equation 26 represents a further
example of ergodic property, based on an equivalence between entropy
intensity (thermal) and entropy density (configurational). The equivalence 27  corresponds to equivalence of entropy (cf.
Part II, Section 223).

The ergodic
property of a system consists, experimentally, in the
parallelism between the binding functions R ln Kdual = {f(1/T)*g(T)} and RT ln Kdual = {f(T)*g(ln T)} and the binding quotients dependent on dilution R ln QK = {f(1/did(A))*g(T)} and RT ln QK = {f(did(A))*g(ln T)}, respectively
(thermal equivalent dilution (TED)) (cf. Part II, Section 323).

2.3 Probability Space and Thermodynamic
Space
The equilibrium constant K is related
to free
energy in thermodynamic space by 28  that by transformation into an exponential
becomes a monocentric partition function 29  in probability space. The exponential probability
factor is, therefore, represented by the equilibrium constant K, which has been shown, in analogy with QK, to be homologous with ideal calculated dilution did(A). This means that state probability too
is homologous with dilution.

Altogether, eqs 28 and 29 represent the
connection between probability (or dilution) space and thermodynamic
space. By analogy, we can move from Gibbs equation (eq 22), in thermodynamic space, to an
exponential expression in probability space 30  This equation tells us that the free-energy
probability factor exp(−ΔGØ/RT) can be factorized into a product of two probability
factors, namely, exp(−ΔHØ/RT), which depends on the reaction enthalpy of
the thermodynamic space, and exp(ΔSØ/R), which depends on the reaction entropy of the
thermodynamic space.

We have shown that, following the ideas
of Lumry,1,2 notwithstanding his pessimistic opinion
on the experimental accessibility
of thermal and motive components of the thermodynamic functions, we
have calculated separated7 thermal and
motive entropy as well as thermal and motive enthalpy, respectively.
We have found (cf. Part II, Section 3) that the observed enthalpy
ΔHdual determined as derivative
in ∂(1/T) of the binding function R ln Kdual = {f(1/T)*g(T)} can be represented in the thermodynamic space as 31  where ΔCp,hydr, hydrophobic heat capacity, is a constant independent
of temperature T. On the other hand, we have found
that the observed entropy ΔSdual determined as a derivative in ∂T of the
binding function RT ln Kdual = {f(T)*g(ln T)} can be represented in the
thermodynamic space by 32  where the slope ΔCp,hydr is numerically equal to the slope
of
the enthalpy function ΔHdual for
the same compound. We have obtained the expressions in eqs 31 and 32 by
applying the extrapolation of ΔHdual to T = 0 and of ΔSdual to ln T = 0, respectively, by taking advantage
of constantd ΔCp,hydr. We have thus identified the intercepts ΔH0 and ΔS0 as
the motive components ΔHmot and
ΔSmot, respectively, foreseen but
not calculated by Lumry. The constancy of heat capacity ΔCp,hydr is necessary by both
analytical geometry and chemistry constraints (cf. Part II, Section
3).23 We can write, therefore 33  and 34  The accuracy of the extrapolation procedure,
based on ΔCp,hydr constant, has been confirmed by the successive self-consistent results
(cf. Part III),24 calculated for both motive
and thermal components in every element of the many reactions examined.

Equation 34, whereby
entropy ΔSdual, experimentally determined,
is the result of a summation of entropy density (ΔSmot = ΔSdens) with entropy
intensity (ΔSth = ΔSints), is a further proof of ergodic property
of these systems. The ergodic hypothesis assumes the equivalence of
configuration changes of entropy (entropy density), depending on space
variables, with thermal changes of entropy, depending on time variables
(entropy intensity) (i.e., the sum ΔSdual = ΔSdens + ΔSints is valid) (see Part II, Section 2). Each function
in thermodynamic space yields an exponential function in probability
space, as shown in Table 2. Therefore, from eqs 33–34 of the thermodynamic space,
we can pass to the probability factors in probability (dilution) space 35  and 36  The probability
factors of eqs 35–36 can be grouped together in a unique product partition
function at
dual structure 37  The dual-structure partition function {DS-PF} of eq 37, valid for every hydrophobic hydration reaction, results
to be the product of two distinct partition functions: a motive partition
function {M-PF} = f(T,did(A)) multiplied
by a thermal partition function {T-PF} = g(T). {M-PF} is of concern of the reacting solute and can give origin
to configuration changes of entropy, i.e., changes of entropy density,
whereas {T-PF}, concerning the solvent,
can produce thermal changes of entropy, i.e., changes of entropy intensity.

a Nonreacting molecule ensemble (NoremE): S ≡
ΔSth.

The motive thermodynamic functions enthalpy (ΔHmot) and entropy (ΔSmot) are referred, in fact (see Part II, Section 4),23 to a reacting mole ensemble (REME), where the
difference
ΔH between levels is on the mole scale a multiple
of RT and ΔS is on the mole
scale of the order of multiples of R (R = 8.314 J K–1 mol–1; capital
M = mole). The mole ensemble is constituted by few elements (moles).
The variability of S is, at constant temperature,
of the order of R times the differential of logarithm
of reciprocal concentration, expressing the molar solvent-to-solute
ratio (see eq 3).

The thermal functions enthalpy, ΔHth, and entropy, ΔSth, concerning
the solvent, are referred to a nonreacting molecule ensemble (NoremE;
small m = molecule), which is characterized by enthalpy
levels very narrowly spaced, with interlevel separation of the order
of magnitude kBT on the
molecule scale, where kB is the Boltzmann
constant (kB = 1.3806 × 10–23 J K–1). NoremE is composed of an extremely large
number of elements (molecules). NoremE is independent of concentration
or dilution so that only thermal changes of entropy intensity can
be produced (cf. (dS)x=1 = Cp dln T in eq 7).

We
set a thermal probability factor referred to a NoremE 38  The thermal functions in the
thermodynamic
space show special properties. By introducing the explicit values
of the differentials, we obtain 39  and 40  

If we calculate the integral of eq 39 and then divide by Tup, we obtaine 41  where ΔSth is clearly identical to the result of the
integration of eq 40. Therefore, we confirm
that 42  conform to eq 38 is a property of any thermal partition function {T-PF}. We obtain the relation for thermal free
energy 43  which is invariably zero in accordance with eqs 38 and 42. This result
is in contrast with the formula widely reported
in the literature (cf. eq 79 in Part. II, Section 8 and citations
therein),23 whereby the thermal free energy
is erroneously stated to be different from zero.

Therefore,
we can set the probability thermal factor as 44  where (−ΔHth/T) ≈ −ΔCp,hydr ln T and ΔSth = ΔCp,hydr ln T

In conclusion, the division of the thermodynamic
functions into
two parts, motive and thermal, proposed by Lumry (and numerically
calculated by us for all of the many compounds examined), is a consequence
of the special dual-structure partition function {DS-PF} (cf. eq 37), valid for every hydrophobic hydration process.

The introduction
of the dual-structure partition function {DS-PF} = {M-PF}·{T-PF} has been
inspired by the suggestion of Lumry who proposed that the experimental
functions ΔHdual and ΔSdual in hydrophobic hydration were separated
into two parts, respectively, ΔHdual = ΔHmot + ΔHtherm and ΔSdual = ΔSmot + ΔStherm. Because a sum of exponent means a product of exponentials, we proposed
the exponential product of eq 37. The thermal exponential is subject to the condition exp(−ΔGtherm/T) = ζth = 1, with (−ΔGtherm) =
0. This condition has been considered as indicative of a system at
constant potential. The solvent, in a very diluted solution, is in
excess and it does not change its concentration i.e., it is at constant
potential. Therefore, the thermal function is suited to represent
the properties of the solvent. The dual structure of the partition
function corresponding to the biphasic composition of the system is
confirmed by the curved shape of the binding functions R ln Kdual = {f(1/T)*g(T)} and RT ln Kdual =
{f(T)*g(ln T)} obtained by mathematical development of the dual-structure
partition function, the binding functions result to be convoluted
functions, whereby the primitive (f) function, either f(1/T) or f(T) of the motive component, which is linear, is modified by the secondary
(g) function, either g(T) or g(ln T) of the thermal
component. We can identify the thermal partition function {T-PF} = g(T) or g(ln T) as the partition
function of the nonreacting solvent and the motive partition function
{M-PF} = f(1/T,1/did(A)) or f(T,did(A)) as the partition
function of the reacting solute.

2.4 Ergodic Algorithmic Model (EAM)
The
ergodic algorithmic model (EAM), obtained by development of the dual-structure
partition function {DS-PF} of eq 37, is based on a complex
network of mathematical relationships connecting the whole set of
experimental thermodynamic data (see Part II, Table 323).

2.4.1 Motive and Thermal Ensembles
We
express the total statistical probability of the thermodynamic state
of the system7,8 in analogy with eq 37 by 45  where Kdual is
the observed equilibrium constant, ΔHdual is the observed reaction enthalpy, and ΔSdual is the observed entropy change. The formation constant Kdual has been demonstrated to be homologous
with a partition function of statistical thermodynamics (cf. Table 1). At constant temperature,
reciprocal concentration (i.e., dilution) in probability space is
a measure of both formation constant and partition function.

The reciprocal concentration is related to the configuration changes
of entropy density (cf. eq 3). The exponential factor exp(−ΔGdual/RT) of the topological probability
space, therefore, is homologous with the topological space of experimental
reciprocal concentrations or dilutions.

An equilibrium constant
is not the only probability parameter suitable
to monitor the equilibrium conditions of the system: in the solubility
of gases or liquids, the parameter is saturation concentration; in
micelle formation, the parameter is critical micelle concentration;
in protein denaturation, the parameter is the denaturation quotient Qden; and so on.

In Table 3, we can
note the correspondence between product probability functions (block
C) and observed probability functions (block D), thus showing how
the functions of the ergodic algorithmic model (EAM) conform to the
observed thermodynamic functions.

As shown in eq 64, the thermal probability factor (or thermal partition function
{T-PF}) is multiplied by a motive probability
factor (or motive partition function, {M-PF}). The latter function is referred to a reacting mole ensemble (REME)
(see Part II, Section 4)23 with equilibrium
constant Kmot 64  Thus, we obtain a total dual-structure product
probability factor {DS-PF} 65  The total
probability factor Kdual is the product
of two partition functions: Kdual = Kmot·ζth with ζth = 1 (cf. eq 37). The constant Kmot is the motive partition
function {M-PF} of the solute, referred
to a reacting ensemble (REME) with (−ΔGmot/RT) ≠ 0, whereas
ζth is the thermal partition function {T-PF} of the solvent, referred to a nonreacting molecule
ensemble (NoremE), with (−ΔGth/RT) = 0.

The curved binding functions (convoluted
functions) obtained by
developing {DS-PF} (see block C in Table 3) can be compared
to the curved binding functions obtained by interpolation of the experimental
data reported in a van’t Hoff plot (see block D in Table 3). The tangents ΔHdual and ΔSdual of the experimental binding functions interpolating the experimental
data are calculated as a sum of two terms (ergodic) as shown in eqs 33 and 34, respectively. From the experimental data, we obtain the
following expressions for enthalpy and entropy probability factors,
respectively 66   67  which clearly conform to eq 65.

2.4.2 Binding Functions
By passing to
the logarithms of the partition functions, we move from probability
space, homologous with the reciprocal concentration (dilution) space,
to thermodynamic space, where we measure energy, enthalpy, and entropy
(see Appendix B). We thus obtain the expressions
presented in block C of Table 3. We note that, in Table 3, the observed binding functions 68  and 69  are expressed in J K–1 mol–1 (entropy
scale) and J mol–1 (enthalpy
scale), respectively, thus confirming that they are in the thermodynamic
space.

The two functions in eq 68 and in eq 69, respectively (see Appendix C), present
diagrams with curvature, depending on the value of ΔCp,hydr. The thermal factor
can be either of class A when ΔCp,hydr > 0 or of class B when ΔCp,hydr < 0. If ΔCp,hydr > 0, the binding functions
(cf. Section 2.5.3) are monotonic
convex at constant curvature amplitude, whereas if ΔCp,hydr < 0, the binding
functions are monotonic concave at constant curvature amplitude. The
curvature amplitude is a constant typical of each parabola and is
inversely proportional to the constant heat capacity ΔCp,hydr (Campl = 0.7071/ΔCp,hydr) thus showing how ΔCp,hydr is constant for mathematical conditions. On
the other hand, because ΔCp,hydr is bound to a phase transition of water from solvent
WI to solute (WII) in all of the compounds of
class A or from solute (WII) to solvent WI in
all of the compounds of class B, respectively (see the definitions
of the properties of class A and class B), ΔCp,hydr results to be constant for chemical
conditions also. Any phase transition from WI (solvent)
to WII (iceberg) is characterized, in fact, by constant
entropy change equal to an enthalpy change divided by temperature,
which means that heat capacity could be labeled as entropic function
ΔCp,hydr = ΔHp,hydr/T = ΔSp,hydr. The
passage of state of pure water to form an iceberg is analogous to
evaporation, although with its own characteristics, with Δsp,w = Cp,w = 75.36 J K–1 mol–1. The interpretation of Δsp,w = Cp,w as a constant value of entropy change for a phase transition
has the important implication that the existence of the phase transition
WI (solvent) → WII (iceberg) (with nw = 1) explains the abnormal high value of heat
capacity of liquid water. This high value is inconsistent with a simple
redistribution of energies over degrees of freedom of a nonreacting
water molecule, as for usual interpretation of heat capacity. The
phase transition of water, in fact, should take place even when we
determine heat capacity of pure liquid water by calorimetry, thus
giving a prominent contribution to heat capacity.

By passing
to the logarithms as in eqs 68 and 69 and then differentiating,
we obtain the relations collected in Table 4. In Table 4, we note that, by assuming ΔCp,hydr constant and independent of temperature,
we arrive at identical ΔCp,hydr by both enthalpy route and entropy route. The same equality
of ΔCp,hydr from
either enthalpy or entropy is obtained by treating the experimental
data. We can conclude, therefore, that the experimental data conform
to the ergodic algorithmic model (EAM) and contain in themselves ΔCp,hydr constant, independent
of temperature. We can thus confirm once again that the heat capacity
ΔCp,hydr is constant
for both chemistry and analytical geometry constraints.

2.4.3 Characteristic Properties of Binding Functions
The
relationships between experimental data, free energy, enthalpy,
and entropy as expressed by the two binding functions R  ln Kdual = {f(1/T)*g(T)} =
−ΔGdualØ/T and RT  ln Kdual = {f(T)*g(ln T)} = −ΔGdualØ are reported in Table
5 of Part II. Being ΔCp,hydr ≠ 0, the functions R ln Kdual = {f(1000/T)*g(T)} and RT ln Kdual = {f(T)*g(ln T)} are curvilinear (Figure 2a,b) represented by second-degree polynomials (see Appendix C). It is worth mentioning that the convex
curves in Figure 2a,b
are referred to the experimental solubility data of helium in water.
These kinds of processes concerning gases belong to class A of the
hydrophobic hydration processes. If we calculate the derivatives ∂(R ln Kdual)/∂(1/T) and ∂(RT ln Kdual)/∂T and plot them
against T and ln T, respectively,
we obtain linear plots (Figure 3a,b). We remind that the indicated derivatives correspond
to the tangents at any point of the curves in Figure 2a,b. The value of the tangent at any point
in the diagram R ln Kdual = f(1/T) (cf. Figure 3a) corresponds to
the value of −ΔHdual, whereas
the value of the tangent at any point in the diagram RT ln Kdual = f(T) (cf. Figure 3b) corresponds to the value of ΔSdual. In these diagrams, TH is the temperature at which ΔHdual = 0 and corresponds to the minimum of the top diagram of Figure 2a. Analogously, TS is the temperature at which ΔSdual = 0 and corresponds to the minimum of the
respective upper diagram of Figure 2b. According to the ergodic algorithmic model presenting
curved binding functions, the apparent dual enthalpy (i.e., the experimental
enthalpy) represented by the tangent of one binding function is composed
of two terms, motive (i.e., entropy density) and thermal (i.e., entropy
intensity) (cf. eq 33).

Figure 2 Solubility of helium11 (class A): (a) R ln Kdual = {f(1/T)*g(T)} = (−ΔGdual/T) = f(1000/T), to calculate enthalpy
(see Figure 3a, below);
(b) RT ln Kdual = {f(T)*g(ln T)} = (−ΔGdual)
= f(T), to calculate entropy (see Figure 3b).

Figure 3 Water solubility of helium11 (class
A): (a) enthalpy plot, ΔHdual =
0 at TH; (b) entropy plot, ΔSdual = 0 at ln TS.

The motive enthalpy ΔHmot is
independent of the temperature, whereas the thermal enthalpy ΔHth depends exclusively on the temperature with
proportionality factor ΔCp,hydr. 79  At TH, the enthalpy
is zero because 80  therefore, by introducing eq 79 into eq 80, we can calculate 81  In this equation, the extrapolation
to T = 0 has been applied, and the extrapolation
to ln T = 0 will be applied in eq 84: these procedures are legal because
ΔCp,hydr is constant.

On the other hand, with the same arguments already used for enthalpy
and TH, we can calculate the motive entropy 82  The relationships
presented so far are referred
to solubility data of argon that is a reaction belonging to class
A with ΔCp,hydr > 0 and iceberg formation. The condition ΔCp,hydr > 0 characterizes the binding
functions as convex.

Analogous relationships are valid for reactions
belonging to class
B, with iceberg reduction (see Appendix C).
The curves in the diagrams of class B present a maximum instead of
a minimum, i.e., are concave. This is shown in an application of these
relationships referred to processes of class B (Figure 4a,b). Talhout et al.12 studied the binding affinity of a series of hydrophobically modified
benzamidinium chloride inhibitors binding to trypsin, using isothermal
calorimetry and molecular dynamic simulation techniques. The binding
functions R ln Kdual and RT ln Kdual reported as the function of (1/T) and T, respectively, show curved plots, as expected
for hydrophobic hydration processes (cf. Figure 4a,b) of class B. The affinity between ligand
benzamidinium chloride and enzyme is due presumably to the formation
of hydrophobic bonds as revealed by the negative values of the reaction
heat capacity ΔCp,hydr (ΔCp,hydr <
0). The condition ΔCp,hydr < 0 characterizes the functions as concave. The diagram
(−ΔG/T) = f(1/T) with a maximum confirms that we are dealing
with a hydrophobic hydration process of class B. The tangent of the
curve is 83  This tangent is variable
with temperature 84  At the maximum, the tangent ΔHdual is nil 85  We define TH as
the temperature at which ΔHdual =
0.

Figure 4 Hexabenzamidimium chloride binding to trypsin12 (class B): (a) R ln Kdual = (−ΔGdual/T) = f(1000/T), with enthalpy as tangent; (b) RT ln Kdual = (−ΔGdual) = f(T), with entropy
as tangent.

Analogously, the plot
(−ΔGdual) = f(T) is a curve with a maximum
at a different temperature. The tangent to this curve is 86  In this case also, the tangent
varies with
temperature 87  At the maximum, ΔSdual is nil 88  We define TS as
the temperature at which ΔSdual =
0. Talhout et al.12 report the data ΔCp,hydr, TS, and TH, concerning the binding
curves of eight compounds (Table 5). The thermodynamic data of every compound in the
list conform to the ergodic algorithmic model (EAM).

2.4.4 Motive
Functions Disaggregated as the Functions
of ξw
The separation of the thermodynamic
functions ΔHdual and ΔSdual into thermal and motive components as proposed
by Lumry1,2 and calculated by us by applying the ergodic
algorithmic model (EAM) 89  can be exploited to extract very
useful pieces
of information from the experimental binding functions. If we accept
the scheme of the ergodic algorithmic model (EAM) that separates the
motive and thermal functions, we have 90  At temperature TH corresponding to the
maximum in the diagram (−ΔGdual/T) = f(1/T),
we have 91  and hence
(Figure 5) an exact
compensation between thermal and
motive enthalpy 92  By knowing ΔCp,hydr from TED, we can calculate
ΔHmot (Figure 6). Analogously, for entropy in class B, we
have 93  From ΔCp,hydr, we can calculate for each compound,
by applying
TED (cf. eq 104 below) 94  where Cp,w = 75.36 J
K mol–1 is the
heat capacity of liquid water.

data reported by Talhout et al.12 for the
ligand benzamidium chloride (class B).

Figure 6 Calculation of ΔSmot from the
data reported by Talhout et al.12 for the

The motive functions ΔHmot and
ΔSmot calculated for a homogeneous
set of compounds can be disaggregated by plotting them against ξw = |nw| (Figure 7) of each compound of the set. The enthalpy
interpolating function (Figure 7A) for the set of ligands (substituted benzamidinium chlorides)
studied by Talhout et al.12 is 95  that is coincident with the mean value of
class B ⟨Δhred⟩B = +23.7 ± 0.6 kJ mol–1 ξw–1 (see Table 4a in Part III).24

Figure 7 Disaggregation of motive functions in class B: (A) ΔHmot and (B) ΔSmot as functions of the pseudostoichiometric number ξw.

The entropy interpolating function
(Figure 7B) in the
same group of compounds is 96  The slope is compared to the mean value of
unitary entropy of class B ⟨Δsred⟩B = +432 ± 4 J K–1 mol–1 ξw–1. The comparison
of the unitary values calculated from the data of Talhout et al.12 with the unitary values reported in Table 5
of Part III24 demonstrates that the foundations
of the model are sound. A constant value of ΔCp,hydr, independent of temperature, is
a necessary property to construct the linear functions ΔHdual = f(T) and ΔSdual = f(ln T) used by Talhout et al. Specifically,
the numbers ξw = |n| calculated
from the slopes of the linear thermal functions can be successfully
employed to disaggregate the corresponding motive functions in a homologous
series of compounds. All of the numerical values of the thermodynamic
functions are self-consistent. The separation of the dual functions
into thermal and motive components leads to coherent numerical results.
These proofs represent further validations of the EAM model itself
because the statistical analysis is indisputable (cf. Section 5 in
Part III).24

2.4.5 Ergodic
Properties
We can complete
the description of the ergodic algorithmic model (EAM) by introducing
the formal mathematical expression of ergodicity of hydrophobic hydration
systems.

The analysis of the binding functions of the ergodic
algorithmic model (EAM) assumes that the function entropy is a measure
of “energy dispersal” in the system. The concept of
“dispersion” can be clearly grasped by analogy with
concentration xA of species A and its
reciprocal ideal dilution did,A = 1/xA. did,A is a measure
of the volume in which 1 mol is dispersed (see Appendix
C). If we suppose to measure a quantity ε of energy density,
the dispersion of energy is given by 1/ε. The thermodynamic
function entropy S is proportional to such energy
dispersal, 1/ε. The dispersal of energy can take place by two
different mechanisms: (a) energy dispersion in time and (b) energy
dispersion in space. The dispersion in time depends on the velocity
of the molecules through the variable temperature T, whereas the dispersion in space depends on variable concentration xA or better on variable dilution did,A = 1/xA. The dispersion
of energy in time increases with temperature T because
the temperature is proportional to the squared mean velocity of the
particles. In fact, if the molecule is running faster, then the energy
carried by the molecule flows more rapidly through the cell, increasing
the dispersion of energy over a longer path in time unit. The dispersion
of energy in time is measured by the squared mean sojourn time, τm2. The sojourn time τ i of ith particle is the time spent by one
molecule to run the length unit (τ i = 1/li). As for dispersion
in space, if we imagine that each molecule is carrying an amount of
energy, when we dilute the molecules, we dilute, at the same time,
the energy associated to each molecule, thus increasing the dispersion
of energy in space. We call entropy intensity the dispersion of energy
in time as the function of temperature T, whereas
we call entropy density the dispersion of energy in space as the function
of dilution did(A). We obtain in such
a way for entropy density 97  and for entropy intensity 98  The ergodic hypothesis assumes that
the variability
in time of entropy or entropy intensity in a thermodynamic system
is equivalent to the variability in space of entropy or entropy density:
entropy intensity and entropy density can be summed up (ergodicity)
because both are parameters of energy dispersal. We have experimentally
verified that in every hydrophobic hydration system, the equivalence
can be experimentally found as thermal equivalent dilution (TED):
variability of R ln K as the function of 1/T is parallel to the variability
of R ln K as the function
of 1/did,A.

The activity of a species
A is set as 99  where xA is the
concentration of A in molar fraction and Φ = T–Cp,A/R is the thermal factor. The thermal equivalent dilution
(TED) principle becomes 100  whereby a change
of entropy density, as obtained
from the motive partition function {M-PF} = {f(1/T)*f(did(A))} is experimentally determined by measuring
a parallel change of entropy intensity by means of the binding function R ln Kdual = {f(1/T)*g(T)} at constant did(A). The potential
distribution theorem (PDT),9 based on a
monocentric partition function, without distinction of entropy density
and entropy intensity, is inconsistent with the dual composition of
biphasic hydrophobic hydration systems (Table 6).

On the other hand, the development
of the theorem PDT called “quasi-chemical
approximation” (improperly defined approximation) is valid
because it considers the different distribution types of the two phases:
molecule statistical distribution of the solvent (entropy intensity)
and mole binomial distribution of the reacting solute (entropy density)
(cf. Part II, Section 10.b).23

2.5 Hydrophobic Heat Capacity, ΔCp,hydr
2.5.1 ΔCp,hydr, Equilibrium Constant,
and TED
The ergodic algorithmic
model (EAM) is completed by the relationships between binding functions
and activities of the reacting species. The TED method based on the
assumption of the validity of the so-called “ergodic hypothesis”
(see Part II, Section 2)23 has appeared
as a potent experimental tool to evaluate the number nw of moles of water WI involved in each reaction.8 The number nw can
be either positive or negative. The number nw will be positive in the processes of class A and negative
in the processes of class B. The number nw, as determined by TED, was assumed at first as being simply proportional
to the volume of the incoming solute and dependent on a generic concentration
of water molecules W. During subsequent researches, however, it has
been proved to correspond to the real number ξw =
|nw| of water clusters WI involved
in each reaction (cf. eqs 98 and 99) and as such we can consider
it. This has opened the way to determine the real number ξw, whereby the water units WII enter as reactant
in every hydrophobic hydration process. The absolute value ξw = |nw| was adopted because in
a group of reactions (class B) nw is negative
and the introduction of the absolute value transfers any change of
sign to the associated thermodynamic quantity, with meaningful thermodynamic
and molecular implications.

The relationship between hydrophobic
heat capacity Cp,hydr and number ξw = |nw| through TED can be found by recalling that eq 95 can be written as a double derivative in
ln T 101  We can set a dissociation constant, valid
for class A 102  where aA, aWII, and aB indicate activities of the species. The changing
of the equilibrium
constant at different temperatures can be represented by a series 103  where R ln K0 = (−ΔG°mot/T).

The second
moment of the distribution is represented in eq 99. Alternatively, the
second moment can be written as the first derivative of the differential
changes δ1 ln aA, δ1 ln aB, δ1 ln aWII induced by the first moment (derivative) 104  Because changes δ1 ln aA and δ1 ln aB compensate
each other, their contribution
is null 105  and then the hydrophobic heat capacity
is
expressed by 106  The TED principle for a
species X with activity aX states 107  where Cp,X is the heat capacity and SX is
the configuration change of entropy of X.

Therefore, we obtain
for the factor (aWIII)ξw of water WII the following equality 108  where Cp,w = 75.36 J K–1 mol–1 is
the isobaric heat capacity of liquid water.

Alternatively, by
changing sign to ξw, we set
an association constant, valid for class B 109  and obtain 110  which represents the curvature
in the binding
functions of class B that present a maximum. There is a relationship
between change in virtual dilution and curvature analogous to that
between ΔCp,hydr and curvature. This means that the curvatures depend on the number
ξw = |nw|. The determination
of the pseudostoichiometric number nw can
be achieved by the variation of virtual dilution ∂(−nw ln aWII/∂ln T ≠ 0) and
hence the variation of the equilibrium constant brought about by the
Lambert thermal energy factor Φ of water molecules WII when the temperature is changing. The reaction coefficient ξw is qualified as “pseudo” because it is in general
noninteger, indicating the ratio between volume of incoming moiety
and volume of cluster WI. We can verify that the variation
of the virtual dilution dWII of water WII (dWII = 1/aWII) is the unique cause
of the curvature (as convoluted function, cf. Figure 9) in the plot (−ΔGdual/T) = f(1/T), as it is ΔCp,hydr.

The coherence and self-consistency of the numerical
results obtained
by applying TED can be considered as the experimental proofs of the
validity of the “ergodic theory or ergodic hypothesis”:
we can now speak of “ergodic properties” of thermodynamic
systems, dismissing the word “hypothesis”. The energy
fluxes in intensity (thermal) and density (configurational) entropy
are equal (cf. Figure 5 in Part II).23

2.5.2 ΔCp,hydr and Phase Transition
in Water WI
The hydrophobic hydration processes
are characterized by large values
of heat capacity ΔCp,hydr. The values of heat capacity 111  are calculated
in general by plotting the
values of the observed enthalpy change ΔHdual against T and then by interpolating the
points by a straight line of equation 112  where ΔCp,hydr is the hydrophobic heat capacity.13 The same rule holds for both calorimetric and
van’t Hoff enthalpy. There has been, however, some debate whether
this equation is exactly valid or only approximately valid. The question,
in other words, is whether the heat capacity ΔCp,hydr is constant and independent of
temperature. We have, therefore, controlled many and many times the
linearity of the experimental data. We have experimentally studied,14 by potentiometry, the protonation constants
of about 40 carboxylic acids at different temperatures. In each case,
we have found that the plot ΔHdual = ΔH0 + g(T) is invariably linear with constant slope ΔCp,hydr. For a homogeneous group
of about 10 carboxylic acids, the value of ΔCp,hydr has been found to be equal. Therefore,
in this group of acids, ΔCp,hydr is constant by changing not only the temperature but
also the acid. On the other hand, we have proved (see Part II, Section
3) that ΔCp,hydr is necessarily constant for both mathematical and chemical constraints.

We have, then, analyzed the experimental data of solubility in
water of more than 50 gases and liquids as determined in other laboratories.15 Next, we passed to the study of the denaturation
processes16,17 and then to the study of micelle formation
processes.18 All of the experimental data
of every hydrophobic hydration process give origin to linear plots
of the function ΔHdual = ΔH0 + g(T).
This behavior conforms to the ergodic algorithmic model (EAM), whereby
ΔCp,hydr is necessarily
constant for analytical geometry constraint. The hydrophobic heat
capacity is constant for chemical constraint also because ΔCp,hydr = (ΔHp,hydr/T) = ΔSp,hydr represents the entropy
change for state passage of water  A peculiarity
of the data concerning each
compound examined was that the experimental data of entropy ΔSdual when plotted against ln T presented linear plots of the function ΔS = g(ln T).17 Moreover, the slope of the diagram ΔSdual = ΔS0 + g(ln T) (i.e., ΔCp,hydr) was numerically equal to the
slope found in the diagram ΔHdual = ΔH0 + g(T) for the same compound. It is possible, therefore, to
set an equation similar to eq 32 113  The equality of the coefficients in the two
diagrams is possible only if ΔCp,hydr is constant and independent of temperature,
in accordance with the equal curvature amplitudes of both binding
functions.

All of these findings representing the experimental
evidence that
ΔCp,hydr is independent
of the temperature actually conform to the ergodic algorithmic model
(EAM).

Another significant characteristic of ΔCp,hydr is that in certain processes,
we find ΔCp,hydr > 0 and in others, ΔCp,hydr < 0. Even in the compounds with negative ΔCp,hydr, we find the identity
of the coefficients ΔCp,hydr in the diagrams ΔHdual = ΔH0 + g(T) and ΔSdual = ΔS0 + g(ln T). We have defined the processes with positive heat capacity (ΔCp,hydr > 0) as belonging
to
class A and those with negative slope (ΔCp,hydr < 0) as belonging to class B. The
hydrophobic heat capacity ΔCp,hydr = ±ξwCp,w (where Cp,w = 75.36 J K–1 mol–1 is
the isobaric heat capacity of liquid water) depends on the stoichiometry
of the reaction with phase transition between water components WI, WII. In class A, the reaction with phase transition
is  whereas in class B, the reaction
with opposite
phase transition is  with iceberg reduction. It is worth
noting
that iceberg formation in class A and iceberg reduction in class B,
respectively, produce changes of the thermodynamic properties of the
solute. As any entropy change, in analogy with Trouton’s law,
ΔCp,hydr could
be labeled as ΔHp,hydr/T. For any phase-transition entropy, ΔCp,hydr = ΔHp,hydr/T is constant,
independent of the temperature. In general, the phase transition takes
place for each compound at a fixed temperature; in these cases, however,
the condition holds at all temperatures of measurement.

The
curvature amplitude of the binding functions is inversely proportional
to the constant hydrophobic heat capacity ΔCp,hydr, as confirmed by an analysis (see Section 2.5.3) of the
experimental data concerning the denaturation of proteins.

2.5.3 ΔCp,hydr and
Curvature Amplitude of Binding Functions
Coming specifically
to protein denaturation, belonging to class A,
we have shown8 that in the plot (−ΔGdual/T) = {f(1/T)*g(T)}, the
curves obtained at different pH and different temperatures19 present the same curvature. In fact, the tangent
of the function is 114  The family of tangents of
a curve (i.e., the
values of ΔHdual) calculated at
different values of the abscissa are straight lines of variable slopes.

By calculating the derivative of ΔHdual with respect to the variable T, we obtain
the heat capacity 115  We note that if the original function (−ΔGdual/T) = f(1/T) were a straight line, as in normal van’t
Hoff plots, the derivative of eq 110 would be a constant at any temperature and the derivative
in eq 111 would be zero.
Therefore, if ΔHdual were constant
at different temperatures, we should have ΔCp,hydr = 0. On the other hand, if the
function (−ΔGdual/T) = f(1/T) is a curve,
then ∂(Hdual)/∂T ≠ 0, and hence we can conclude that the function is not a
simple function f(1/T), rather it
will come out to be a convoluted function (−ΔGdual/T) = {f(1/T)*g(T)}. If
by deriving further eq 84, we obtain 116  then we conclude that ΔCp,hydr is constant. Therefore, the curvature
amplitude of van’t Hoff plot is constant as well. The reciprocal
value of ΔCp,hydr is a measure of the curvature amplitude of the function (−ΔGdual/T) = {f(1/T)*g(T)}. The experimental data
for DMS derivative of chymotrypsinogen19 are reported in Figure 8A. If the curvature of van’t Hoff plot is constant
and independent of T, a vertical displacement downward,
simply by changing pH, of the experimental values of log Qden gets curves. Labeled a–d in Figure 8A, without altering
the curvature. From a single curve, therefore, one can obtain sections
displaced downward to bring every section to values of log Qden around zero. The concentration quotient Qden = αden/(1 – αden), as it is well known, can be reliably measured, in fact,
at values around 1 (i.e., log Qden = 0). The displacement produced by changing pH keeps the curvature
constant because the constant curvature amplitude is inversely proportional
to the constant ΔCp,hydr (Campl = 0.7071/ΔCp,hydr). The sections a–d, in
fact, of the curve measured at different pHs result to be displaced
downward to bring them at ordinate values around the line log Qden = 0. The experimental curves a–d
obtained at different pHs can be brought again onto the same common
curve e by a simple parallel upward displacement because they have
constant curvature (Figure 8B). This type of curve conforms to the mathematical algorithm
presented in Part II, Section 3 and to the properties of a geometrical
parabola (see Appendix C) g(T), as shown by an analysis of the data obtained
by Pfeil and Privalov.20

These authors have reported a list of values of enthalpy
and entropy
for native (HN and SN) and denatured (HD and SD) lysozyme.21,22 The thermodynamic
functions have been measured at six different values of pH (7–2).
From the tabulated values, we have calculated the functions Hden = HD – HN and Sden = SDD – SN (we
recall that Hden and Sden are the observed experimental thermodynamic functions
analogous to Hdual and Sdual, respectively). The calculated values of Hden are reported in Table 7, and the calculated values of Sden are reported in Table 8. The observed values of enthalpy and entropy as functions
of T and of ln T, respectively,
are shown in Figure 9A,B.

Even the data reported by Pfeil and Privalov,20 therefore, confirm all of the properties typical
of the
ergodic algorithmic model (EAM) as found in any denaturation diagram.
Both convoluted binding functions R ln Kdual= (−ΔGdual/T) = {f(1/T)*g(T)} and RT ln Kdual= (−ΔGdual) = {f(T)*g(ln T)} are convex, with the same constant curvature amplitude,
as shown by the linear derivatives (tangents) ∂(R ln Kdual)/∂(1/T) and ∂(RT ln Kdual)/∂T reported in Figure 9A,B, respectively.

3 Conclusions
The analysis of the procedure
followed by us in the study of hydrophobic
hydration processes has made possible to set an ergodic algorithmic
model (EAM) based on a dual-structure (motive/thermal) partition function,
{DS-PF}. From this dual-structure partition
function {DS-PF}, a homogeneous set
of parabolic binding functions R ln Kdual = {f(1/T)*g(T)} and RT ln Kdual = {f(T)*g(ln T)} can be derived, suited to describe coherently all of the properties
of this important series of reactions. These results have been obtained
as a development of the suggestion put forward by Lumry1,2 of considering the thermodynamic functions enthalpy and entropy
as composed of two parts, thermal and motive, respectively. By examining
the theoretical foundations of this proposal, we have concluded that
the system of every hydrophobic hydration process is biphasic and
that the dual-structure partition function {DS-PF} 117  represents the probability state of these
processes. The probability state has been demonstrated to be homologous
with dilution (i.e., reciprocal concentration) and as such it is amenable
of experimental determination. On the other hand, by passing to the
logarithm of the partition function, we move from probability space
to thermodynamic space, whereby we can experimentally determine free
energy, enthalpy, and entropy. The fundamental homology relationship
between ideal dilution did, partition
function ZM, formation quotient QK, and formation constant K (or other equivalent potential function) has permitted to show how
the mathematical expression of each function, partition function,
formation constant, formation quotient, or chemical potential can
be considered, at constant temperature, as a configuration (dilution)
change of entropy density (dS)T = (R dln did(A))T and reported on the
same abscissa axis in the geometrical plane where we can plot the
vector representation of Gibbs equation 118  The vector representation
is referred to the
abscissa axis, where dilution and configuration change of entropy
density (dS)T = (R dln did(A))T are reported, and to the ordinate axis whereby
thermal change of entropy intensity (−ΔHØ/T) is reported. The vector geometry
shows how there is a necessary perfect equality between thermal entropy
intensity vector −ΔHØ/T and an entropy density
component vector ΔSH. The equality is necessary because both are legs of an isosceles
right triangle. The equality 119  is the mathematical formulation of the ergodic
property of the chemical systems. The ergodic condition requires that
dispersion of energy in time is equivalent to dispersion of energy
in space. In terms of molecular processes, this means that thermal
change of entropy intensity, produced by temperature and, therefore,
by molecular velocity, equals the change of entropy density produced
by dilution (see Part II,23 Section 2).

In any hydrophobic hydration process, the hydrophobic heat capacity,
ΔCp,hydr results
to be a remarkable characteristic quantity. The hydrophobic heat capacity
ΔCp,hydr is a constant
that behaves as a phase-transition entropy intensity change (ΔHp,hydr/T),
similar to the Trouton constant. The Trouton law states that the ratio
ΔHevap/Teb = ΔSevap is constant for many
liquids, independent of temperature. By accepting as legal,f being hydrophobic heat capacity ΔCp,hydr actually constant, the extrapolation
of ΔHdual to T =
0 and of ΔSdual to lnT = 0, we have been able to calculate the function ΔHmot separated from ΔHth as well as ΔSmot separated
from ΔSth, respectively. From the
separate functions in the thermodynamic space, we have gone back to
the probability space. Thus, we have obtained a dual-structure product
partition function {DS-PF} valid for
every hydrophobic hydration process.

The product partition function
{DS-PF} of eq 113 is the product
of a motive partition function multiplied by a thermal partition function.  The thermal
partition function {T-PF} is referred
to the solvent, whereas the motive
partition function {M-PF}is referred
to the solute. The solvent is represented by a nonreacting molecule
ensemble (NoRemE), whereas the solute is represented by a reacting
mole ensemble (REME). The thermal functions ΔHth/T and ΔSth do not contribute to free energy because they compensate
each other at any temperature, giving null thermal free energy (−ΔGth/T = −ΔHth/T + ΔSth = 0). On the other hand, {M-PF} is referred to the solute, yielding non-null motive free
energy, (−ΔGmot/T ≠ 0). The introduction of the Lambert thermal energy factor
(THEF) Φ = T–(Cp,A/R) associated
with the concentration is the source of ergodicity of the thermodynamic
systems, generating the thermal equivalent dilution (TED) principle.

From {DS-PF}, an ergodic algorithmic
model can be developed consisting of a set of parabolic binding functions R ln Kdual = {f(1/T)*g(T)} and RT ln Kdual = {f(T)*g(ln T)} (see Appendix C and Part II,23 Section 2). The binding
functions of any hydrophobic hydration process are curved parabolic
functions. The geometrical properties of the binding functions are
representative of the characteristics of the thermodynamic properties
of each hydrophobic hydration process. In fact, the tangents to the
binding functions correspond to the observed thermodynamic functions
enthalpy ΔHdual and entropy ΔSdual, respectively: ΔHdual for each compound is a linear function of T with slope ΔCp,hydr, whereas ΔSdual is
a linear function of lnT with identical slope ΔCp,hydr. This same coefficient
ΔCp,hydr is inversely
proportional to the constant curvature amplitude of both parabolic
binding functions in every compound examined and is, therefore, a
constant independent of temperature T for each compound.
Moreover, the hydrophobic hydration heat capacity ΔCp,hydr results to be constant, independent
of temperature, for chemical conditions, too. In fact, we have shown
that ΔCp,hydr =
±ξwCp,w (where Cp,w = 75.36 J K–1 mol–1 is the isobaric
heat capacity of liquid water), depends on the stoichiometry of the
reaction (phase transition) between water components WI, WII, and WIII. The coefficient ±ξw is the power of the ligand WII in an association
or dissociation constant, K = aA{(aWII)±ξw·aB–1},
where aA, (aWII)±ξw, and aB indicate activity of the species. The positive
coefficient +ξw is referred to a reaction of iceberg
formation (class A) with dissociation constant Kdiss, whereas the negative coefficient −ξw is referred to a reaction of iceberg reduction (class B)
with association constant Kass. As a function
of a pseudostoichiometric coefficient ±ξw, ΔCp,hydr remains the same as
far as the reaction is the same. For the same reason, the coefficient
ΔCp,hydr is equal
for both enthalpy (ΔHdual = ΔHmot + g(T))
and entropy (ΔSdual = ΔSmot + g(ln T)) functions.

By a general survey of the literature concerning
the hydrophobic
hydration processes, we can conclude that the proposal of considering
these systems as biphasic with the inherent adoption of the dual partition
function represents a novelty and is promising of profitable results
in this important field.

One more point of advancement of this
paper is that, by applying
the thermal factor Φ = f(τm2) = T–(Cp,A/R) to the
concentration parameter xA, we have opened
the way to computer calculations of the ergodic properties of chemical
solutions.

Appendix A
Solution Entropy
and the Second Law of Thermodynamics
The second law of thermodynamics
deals with energy dispersal, on
which the idea of entropy was founded. The entropy change can be either
entropy intensity or entropy density, which are equivalent (ergodicity).
They can be summed up or subtracted from each other, notwithstanding
the different molecular mechanisms:(a) Entropy intensity change is produced
by a temperature change dln T.

(b) Entropy density change is produced
by a dilution change dln did.



Therefore, entropy S being
a function
of two variables T and did, as shown in eq 7,
the relationship can be formalized as A.1  and by differentiating, in explicit
form,
we can write for component A

 A.2  By considering that for component A A.3  where
δrevQp is the reversibly exchanged heat, we
obtain the correct expression of entropy in solution A.4  with (δrevQp/T) ≥ 0 and
(R dln did(A)) ≥ 0. The second law of thermodynamics puts to entropy the
condition A.5  This old expression, usually
found in the
texts for the characteristic conditions of entropy change imposed
by the second law of thermodynamics, considers only entropy intensity
but ignores the existence of entropy density. The old expression,
in fact, is adequate for thermal machines doing mechanical work or
in general for processes involving only heat transfers. The definition
of the limitations of entropy (≥0) follows the second law of
thermodynamics. We can recall the definition of Clausius of the second
law of thermodynamics (1856): “Heat can never pass from colder
to warmer body without any other change, connected therewith, occurring
at the same time”. The expression of eq A.5 is, however, inadequate for reacting chemical
systems involving concentration changes. We can add, therefore, a
further sentence, concerning entropy density changes, to the definition
of Clausius, as a consequence of eq 5 and inherent limitations. The following are the results
of the complete second law, for systems out of equilibrium:(i) Heat can never pass,
at constant dilution,
from colder to warmer body without any other change, connected therewith,
occurring at the same time and

(ii) Molecules can never pass, at constant
temperature, from more diluted to more concentrated solutions without
spending chemical or electrochemical work.



Both definitions are valid and correspond to the common sense that
confirms that as heat tends to pass spontaneously from hot to cold
bodies to disperse energy, the solute in a solution diffuses from
concentrated to diluted solutions, thus obtaining dispersion of the
energy carried by molecules. Both processes are entropic effects,
whereby the system is evolving toward a state of maximum entropy:(i) (dS)d = (δrevQp/T) ≥ 0 (entropy
intensity
change, at constant dilution) and

(ii) (dS)T = (R dln did(A)) ≥ 0 (entropy density change, at
constant temperature).

a set of mathematical relationships (Table B2), which is different from that of a normal
constant. The characteristic property of the experimental constant Kdual is that the binding functions R ln Kdual = {f(1/T)*g(T)} and RT ln Kdual =
{f(T)*g(ln T)} are convoluted parabolic curves. The curvature amplitude,
ΔCp,hydr (heat
capacity), is invariably constant in each compound, identical for
both enthalpy and entropy.

b ΔCp,hydr = ±ξwCp,w (with Cp,w = heat capacity of water).

The heat capacity ΔCp,hydr depends on the number
ξw of water molecules
WI involved in each reaction and on the molar heat capacity
of liquid water Cp,w (ΔCp,hydr = ±ξwCp,w, where ξw is an absolute number and Cp,w = 75.36 J K–1 mol–1). The number ξw is positive (+) for convex curves
and negative (−) for concave curves. The sign (+) is for compounds
of class A (those forming iceberg WII from water WI (solvent)), whereas the sign (−) holds for compounds
of class B (those transforming iceberg WII into water WI (solvent)). Water WI constitutes the solvent,
whereas iceberg WII belongs to the solute. Values of ΔHmot and ΔSmot are calculated from the curves of Table B2. For enthalpy, the value of ΔHmot is calculated by extrapolation to T = 0 of the tangent B.11  whereas for entropy,
ΔSmot is calculated by extrapolation
to ln T = 0 of the tangent B.12  At this point, the question arose:
why do
we find binding functions as straight lines in normal reactions and
as parabolic curves in hydrophobic hydration processes? We found an
answer by considering that for normal reactions, we are dealing with
a monophasic system represented by a monocentric partition function Km (e.g., van’t Hoff equation from monocentric
function), whereas in hydrophobic hydration processes, we have two
phases, pure solvent and solute. Each phase is represented by a constant:
constant ζth = 1 for the solvent and constant Kmot for the solute, respectively, thus obtaining
a product constant Kdual B.13  representing a dual-structure partition function
{DS-PF}. The constant Kmot represents a monophasic distribution as does any normal
constant Km, whereas the experimental
dual constant Kdual represents a biphasic
distribution. If the solution under consideration is extremely diluted
in water, as is the case of every hydrophobic hydration process, the
solvent in excess is at constant composition, hence at constant potential.
Under these conditions, the molecular frame (MF) approach27 can be applied. According to MF, the solvent is considered a continuum,
for example, to vacuum in ideal gas or as an implicit solvent in computational
procedures. The mathematical development (Table B3) of Kmot is
practically identical to that of a normal constant Km (cf. Table B1), whereas the development of ζth (ζth = 1) is practically null (cf. Table B4).

By comparing Table B4 with Table B1, we
observe that Kmot depends on temperature T in the same way as a constant Km for a normal reaction (as in van’t Hoff equation), with constant
ΔHmot. In Table 4, we observe that ζth depends
exclusively on temperature (ΔHth = ΔCp,hydr·T). In fact, as far as the solvent is concerned, we observe
that the solvent constitutes a nonreacting system for which free energy
ΔGth/T is invariably
null, as shown in the following equations for protein denaturation B.26  where Td is the
temperature in the middle of transformation. Please note that the
two integrals should be almost equal (≈) because of the small
ineffective difference in the lower limits T = 0
and ln T = 0, respectively, under the condition
that Td > 273 K ≫ 1 K so that B.27  because B.28  Therefore, we can conclude that the
whole
hydrophobic hydration system is composed of two phases (solvent and
diluted solute) and consequently the partition function comes out
to be a dual-structure partition function {DS-PF} B.29  

Appendix C
Parabolic Binding Functions from {DS-PF}
By developing the dual-structure partition function
{DS-PF}, we obtain curved binding functions R ln Kdual = {f(1/T)*g(T)} and RT ln Kdual = {f(T)*g(ln T)}, which are convoluted functions,
as regular parabolas. The double dependence on T in
{f(1/T)*g(T)} and in {f(T)*g(ln T)} is a consequence of the
dual structure of {DS-PF} = {M-PF}·{T-PF}. The second function g(T) in {f(1/T)*g(T)} or g(ln T) in {f(T)*g(ln T)}, respectively, derived from the thermal factor {T-PF}, is the origin of the parabolic curvature
induced to R ln Kmot = f(1/T) or to RT ln Kmot = f(T), respectively, which are linear functions
derived from the motive factor {M-PF}. It is very useful, therefore, to show how the properties of each
hydrophobic hydration process correspond to the geometrical properties
of the parabola function.

The general equation for a parabola
is C.1  and for a parabola passing through the origin
is C.2  In these parabolas, the Focus F has coordinates F(0, 0.5/a). To
calculate the curvature amplitude of a parabola, we search for the
value x giving y = 0.5/a C.3  thus
obtaining C.4  and hence C.5  from which
we calculate the curvature amplitude Campl (represented by segment F-C in Figure 10) C.6  Equation C.2 corresponds to the thermodynamic functions C.7   C.8  In these parabolas, the focus has
coordinates F(0, 0.5/ΔCp,hydr), the curvature amplitude is C.9  In the following diagrams, we represent
parabolas
passing through the origin, to show how the sign of ΔCp,hydr is determinant to get
convex (ΔCp,hydr > 0, Figure 10)
or concave (ΔCp,hydr < 0, Figure 11) functions, respectively.

Figure 10 Convex parabola amplitude is inversely proportional
to a > 0 (a → ΔCp,hydr > 0).

Figure 11 Curvature amplitude: Campl = 0.7071/ΔCp,hydr.

referred to axes: x(1/T), y(R ln K) (Figure 12A).

Figure 12 Convex
(class A) parabolic binding functions (R ln Kdual) = {f(1/T)*g(T)} and

The function represents
a parabola, with curvature amplitude: Campl = 0.7071/ΔCp,hydr.

The first derivative D.1  is plotted in a diagram
with axes: x(T), y(ΔH): the function is a straight line with
slope ΔCp,hydr.
The second mixed derivative
results to be D.2  with Campl = 0.7071/ΔCp,hydr.

The differentials at denominator (∂(1/T) ∂T) correspond to the abscissa axes
of the two successive diagrams, thus showing how the binding function y(R ln Kdual) = {f(1/T)*g(T)} is a double-convoluted function in
(1/T, T) space.

Binding Function
(RT ln Kdual) = {f(T)*g(ln T)}
The
diagram is referred to axes: x(T), y(RT ln Kdual) (Figure 12B).

The function represents a parabola, with
curvature amplitude: Campl = 0.7071/ΔCp,hydr.

The first derivative D.3  is plotted in a diagram with axes: x(ln T), y(ΔS): the function is a straight line with slope ΔCp,hydr. The second mixed derivative
results to be D.4  with Campl = 0.7071/ΔCp,hydr.

The differentials
at denominator (∂T ∂ln T) correspond to the abscissa axes of the two successive
diagrams, thus showing how the binding function RT ln Kdual = {f(T)*g(ln T)} is a double-convoluted function in (T, ln T) space.

Common Second Derivative
The second
mixed derivatives
of the two curved binding functions are equal D.5  Both binding
functions are parabolas with
equal curvature amplitude Campl = 0.7071/ΔCp,hydr.

The second mixed
derivatives in eq D.5 represents the connection between the two binding functions R ln Kdual and RT ln Kdual: ΔCp,hydr cannot be nonconstant
because it represents the constant curvature amplitude of both binding
functions.

Axis Transformation
The matrix product D.6  represents the transformation from
binding
function R ln Kdual = {f(1/T)*g(T)} to binding function RT ln Kdual = { f(T)*g(ln T)}. The matrix {Ttr} operates an axis transformation
from axis (1/T) to axis (ln T), by multiplication factor (T ln T) (Figure 13).

Figure 13 Axis transformation from space (1/T, T) to space (lnT, T).

The matrices of the product in
explicit format become  The
function transformation R ln Kdual = {f(1/T)*g(T)} → RT ln Kdual =
{f(T)*g(ln T)} is not a function multiplication, rather a geometrical
transformation from space (1/T, T) to space (T, ln T). The
binding function R ln Kdual is expressed in entropy units (J K–1 mol–1); the binding function RT ln Kdual is expressed
in enthalpy units (J mol–1).

Function Convolution
In functional analysis, convolution
is a mathematical operation on two functions, f and g, to produce a third function C{f * g}, which expresses how the shape of
one function (f) is modified by the other function
(g).

The function couples {f(1/T)*g(T)} and
{f(T)*g(ln T)}, at constant did(A)=(1/xA), represent function convolutions. The convoluted
functions are generated by the dual structure of the partition function  The modified f functions,
i.e., the first function f(1/T)
in the convolution {f(1/T)*g(T)}, or the first function f(T) in the convolution {f(T)*g(ln T)}, respectively,
are generated by {M-PF} (motive partition
function), whereas the modifying g functions, i.e.,
the second function g(T) in the
convolution {f(1/T)*g(T)}, or the second function g(ln T) in the convolution {f(T)*g(ln T)}, respectively,
are generated by {T-PF} (thermal partition
function).

In hydrophobic hydration processes, the f functions RlnKmot = f(1/T) and RT ln Kmot = f(T),
those to be modified by functions g, are linear functions
(e.g. van’t Hoff equation), whereas the convoluted functions
are curvilinear.

dilution, did(A) = 1/xA; cf. eq 21.

c See Part II, Section 4.23

d The
extrapolations to T = 0 and to ln T = 0 outside the experimental
range do not imply that the system will follow experimentally these
functions but that we can separate completely the effects of the temperature.
With the same procedure, by extrapolating the law of thermal expansion
of the ideal gas to T = 0 (V = V0 (1 + αt) with α
= 1/273), W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) established the Kelvin scale of
the absolute temperatures T = (t + 273)/K.

e The symbol ≈
(practically equal
to) is appropriate because the integration limits of ∫ΔCp,hydr dT are from T1 = 0 to Tup, whereas the integration limits of ∫ΔCp,hydr dln T are from T1 = 1 (T1 ≈ 0) to Tup, under the
condition that Tup > 273 ≫ 1.

to T = 0 and to ln T = 0.
