Ruthenium-containing
tetraphenylporphyrin (Ru-TPP) molecule was
prepared, and the structural elucidation was confirmed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), CHN, and mass spectral
analyses. The incorporation of ruthenium ion into the cavities of
the macromolecule was confirmed from the disappearance of the 1H NMR signal, characteristic of the N–H bond (−2.72
ppm in TPP). The CHN and mass spectral analyses of the ligand and
metallomacromolecules are consistent with the theoretically calculated
values. The homogeneous Ru-TPP macromolecule is grafted on the surface
of aminosilane-, diaminosilane-, and iodosilane-functionalized SBA-15
molecular sieves. The successful grafting of Ru-TPP on functionalized
mesoporous molecular sieve materials was evident from low-angle powder
X-ray diffraction, 13C magic angle spinning NMR, and scanning
electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray analyses. The resultant
homogeneous and heterogenized Ru-TPP catalysts were used for the utilization
of carbon dioxide (CO2) under moderate reaction conditions.
The homogeneous Ru-TPP catalyst showed first-order kinetics with respect
to epoxide with the exclusive formation of cyclic carbonate (about
98%) and an activation energy of 16.07 kg/mol, which is much lower
than some of the reported catalysts. Ru-TPP grafted on aminosilane-
and iodosilane-functionalized materials showed better catalytic activity
(above 90% conversion and 83–96% cyclic carbonate selectivity)
and reusability for the chosen reaction.

1 Introduction
CO2 is an important constituent of air with a typical
concentration of ∼400 ppm. The conversion and utilization of
CO2 into gasoline, cyclic carbonates, useful chemicals,
and so forth are currently interesting research areas.1 The International Panel on Climate Change has reported
that CO2 concentrations have increased by 19%,2 which contributes to climate change via global
warming. Consequently, CO2 is considered the most abundant
and cheapest source of carbon that can be utilize for the synthesis
of various organic products.3 During the
last three decades, various materials have been used as CO2 adsorbents, including zeolites, metal organic frameworks, porous
carbon, and carbon nanotubes.4 Another
important process employs CO2 for electrochemical reduction
to methanol, formic acid, methane, and other compounds.5 Similarly, the utilization of CO2 as
a renewable carbon feedstock in the synthesis of cyclic carbonate
is an important process as well as growing field of research, both
from academic and industrial points of view.6−18 Cyclic carbonates are important intermediates and building blocks
in the synthesis of various fine chemicals, such as carbonates, glycols,
carbamates, and pyrimidines, as well as solvents for polymeric resins.6 They are widely used as aprotic polar solvents,
organic synthetic intermediates, and in some biomedical applications.19 Recent reports have demonstrated the application
of cyclic carbonates as versatile etherifying agents for lignin and
tannin functionalization, which are the most important and widely
available renewable sources of aromatic structures.20 Reportedly, for the utilization of CO2, both
homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts require vigorous reaction
conditions, such as relatively high pressure, temperature, solvents,
and expensive cocatalysts, because of the low reactivity of CO2.9−18,21−25 Therefore, researchers are interested in developing
efficient catalysts for the utilization of CO2 by the conversion
of epoxide into the corresponding carbonate, under comparable reaction
conditions.

It is well known that biological systems convert
CO2 by photosynthesis in the presence of metallomacromolecules.
In this
regard, various metalloporphyrin molecules have been demonstrated
as potential catalysts for several organic transformations, particularly
bifunctional porphyrin-based systems, which show high catalytic efficiencies.
Ema et al. reported bifunctional Mg porphyrins as efficient catalysts
for CO2 coupling to epoxides.23 Noble-metal-based catalysts exhibit high activities toward the activation
of CO2, hydrogenation, and other reactions. However, product
recovery and purification are difficult when these catalyst systems
are applied; therefore, finding an ideal catalyst for the CO2 cycloaddition system7,23 is challenging. Ruthenium-based
organometallic complexes are known as noble metal catalysts, which
are often used commercially in many reactions26 such as hydrogenation,27−29 olefin metathesis,30−32 C–C bond formation,32,33 C–H bond activation,34 electrochemical reduction,35,36 and steam reformation of hydrocarbons.36,37 Ruthenium chemistry is interesting because of its existence in variable
oxidation states from −2 to +8.37 Furthermore, Ru-based organometallic complexes are widely used for
the reduction of CO2 to formaldehyde and electrocatalytic
and photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate38−40 and methanol.41−43 Moreover, Ru-based pincer complexes can be used for
highly efficient electrocatalytic reductive conversion of CO2.3 Porphyrin molecules are analogous to
pincer ligands which form stable metalloporphyrin complexes, a versatile
class of homogeneous catalysts suitable for the electrocatalytic reduction
of CO244−46 and CO2 coupling with epoxides.47−49 It is also worth mentioning here that ruthenium-based porphyrin
complexes were also shown as promising catalysts for alkene epoxidation,
cyclopropanation,50,51 oxidation52 reactions, and so forth. In addition, metalloporphyrin
(magnesium and aluminum)-based systems are also used for carbon dioxide
utilization by epoxide coupling with CO2.53−55 However, to the best of our knowledge, ruthenium tetraphenylporphyrin-based
complexes are not explored for CO2 utilization.

Herein,
ruthenium-containing tetraphenylporphyrin macromolecule
was prepared for the first time, and the resulting metallomacromolecule
was heterogenized on the functionalized SBA-15 materials. The prepared
materials were thoroughly characterized by several spectroscopic and
analytical techniques. The homogeneous Ru-TPP macromolecules and surface-grafted
materials were used for the carbonylation of epoxides using CO2 at moderate reaction temperature, pressure, and without any
solvent.

2 Experimental Protocol
2.1 Preparation
of the Catalyst
All experiments
were conducted using the Schlenk technique. Before the experiments,
all the solvents and starting materials were dried by a standard procedure.56

2.2 Synthesis of Ru-Tetraphenylporphyrin
Complex
meso-Tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP)
was prepared by
refluxing freshly dried pyrrole (0.027 mol) and benzaldehyde (0.028
mol) in 100 mL of propionic acid for 2 h (Scheme 1). After the stipulated period, the reaction
mixture was cooled to 25 °C, filtered, and washed thoroughly
with methanol. The resulting purple crystals were air-dried and recrystallized
in dichloromethane. The ruthenium-incorporated meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (Ru-TPP) complex was prepared by dissolving
the metal salt (RuCl3·XH2O; 1 mmol) in 5 mL of dry acetone, followed by introducing a solution
containing 1 mmol of TPP in 45 mL of dry acetone (Scheme 1). The final mixture was refluxed
under N2 atmosphere for 24 h. After the completion of the
reaction, the solvent was removed and washed with pentane to remove
impurities, after which the product was isolated.56,57

Scheme 1 Syntheses of TPP and Ru-TPP
2.3 Synthesis of Functionalized SBA 15
SBA-15
was prepared as per the reported procedure (see Supporting Information), using the pluronic P123
triblock copolymer(poly (ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene
oxide) EOnPO70EOn as a surfactant (see Supporting Information). The calcined SBA-15 support (6.5 g) was preactivated
at 200 °C in an air oven, followed by drying in a vacuum, in
a round-bottom flask to remove the physisorbed molecules. Subsequently,
a predetermined amount (3 mmol/g of solid support) of N-[3-(trimethoxy silyl)-propyl]-ethylenediamine/(3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane/(3-iodopropyl)trimethoxysilane
was introduced to the activated SBA-15 support material.58−60 The mixture was refluxed in dry toluene (30 mL/g of support) for
24 h under N2 atmosphere. This procedure was repeated thrice
to completely convert the surface silanol groups into organofunctionalities.
The resultant mixture was cooled to room temperature, washed with
dichloromethane, and then dried in vacuum to afford the final product
(SBA-X-functionalized materials). The materials that were functionalized
using diamino-, amino-, and iodosilane are represented as SBA-D, SBA-A,
and SBA-I, respectively (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Functionalization of SBA-15 with Various Organosilanes
2.4 Synthesis of Ru-TPP–SBA-X
The grafting of the Ru-TPP complex on the functionalized material
(SBA-X) was achieved by introducing 0.05 mmol Ru-TPP in 50 mL of dry
methanol suspended with 1 g of the support material (SBA-X), followed
by refluxing for 24 h under N2 atmosphere. Subsequently,
the metalloporphyrin (Ru-TPP)-grafted materials were collected by
separating the solvent and washing with methanol and dichloromethane;
subsequently, the product was vacuum-dried.56−60 Ru-TPP grafted on diamino-, amino-, and iodo-functionalized
SBA-15 are represented as Ru-TPP–SBA-D, Ru-TPP–SBA-A,
and Ru-TPP–SBA-I, respectively (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Ru-TPP–SBA-X
2.5 Catalytic Studies
In a typical reaction,
2 mL (30 mmol) of epichlorohydrin was introduced into a 50 mL autoclave
containing 0.01 g (0.0126 mmol) of the homogeneous catalyst (Ru-TPP);
subsequently, the autoclave was flushed with CO2 several
times. The reaction was charged with the required CO2 pressure
of 4 bar. The reaction was performed at 80 °C for 8 h. Afterward,
the reactor was cooled to room temperature, and the excess CO2 was vented out. The results were analyzed quantitatively
by gas chromatography using an FID detector equipped with an HP 88
column (Mayura Analytical model 2100). The products were further confirmed
by gas chromatography (GC), mass spectrometry (MS) and Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) data. Similarly, the reaction was carried out by
using a heterogeneous catalyst in which 2 mL (30 mmol) of epichlorohydrin
was introduced into a 50 mL autoclave containing 0.1 g of the heterogeneous
catalyst (Ru-TPP–SBA-A/Ru-TPP–SBA-D/Ru-TPP–SBA-I),
and the autoclave was flushed with CO2 several times. The
reaction was performed at 100 °C for 8 h, with the required CO2 pressure of 4 bar (Scheme 4).6

Scheme 4 Carbonylation of
Epichlorohydrin Using CO2
3 Characterization Methods
FT-IR spectra of
all the materials were recorded on a PerkinElmer
spectrum-2 FT-IR spectrometer in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 using the KBr method and were collected with 4 cm–1 resolution and 120 scans. The UV–vis spectrum
of the homogeneous and DR-UV–vis spectra of the Ru-TPP heterogenized
samples were recorded on a PerkinElmer LAMBDA 35 spectrometer. The 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the porphyrin
ligand and the metalloporphyrin molecule were recorded using CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the standard on a
Brücker AVANCE III 400 instrument. Electrospray ionization
time-of-flight mass spectra were recorded on a Brücker maXis
mass spectrometer using methanol as the solvent. Elemental analyses
were performed on an Elementar vario MICRO cube by grinding the sample
into a fine powder and packing in an aluminum foil. Solid-state magic
angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra were recorded on a Brücker
AVANCE 400 wide bore spectrometer equipped with a superconducting
magnet with a field of 7.1 T using a 4 mm double-resonance MAS probe
operating at a resonant frequency of 79.4 MHz that was employed for 29Si MAS NMR. In each case, the samples were packed in 4 mm
zirconia rotors and subjected to a spinning speed of 10 kHz; single-pulse
experiments with a pulse duration of 4.5 μs and a relaxation
delay time of 6 s were used for recording all 13C MAS NMR
patterns. All chemical shift values are expressed with respect to
glycine for 13C nucleus. The textural properties [Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH)
average pore volume] of the heterogenized samples were followed by
N2 sorption measurements at −196 °C using an
automatic micropore physisorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020,
USA). The samples were degassed at 110 °C for 10 h under a pressure
of 10–3 Torr prior to each run. Powder X-ray diffraction
patterns of all the heterogenized materials were collected on a Bruker-D8
high-resolution X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.5418), in the 2θ range of 0.5–10° with a scan
speed and step size of 0.5°/min and 0.02°, respectively.
The morphology and particle size of materials were obtained from the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images on an EVO MA15 Zeiss microscope
operated at 10–20 kV. Finely crushed powder samples were “dusted”
on a double-sided carbon tape and mounted over the sample holder.
Gold sputtering of the materials was carried out on a gold sputter
coater JEC 300, to avoid charging and make the surface conducting.
Finally, the specimens were analyzed in secondary electron imaging
mode at different magnifications and desired voltages. Thermogravimetric
analyses (TGAs) were performed using a TGA instrument (PerkinElmer
STA 6000) under a nitrogen atmosphere, with a heating rate of 10 °C/min,
ranging from 40 to 850 °C. Elemental compositions present in
the final materials were determined using a wavelength-dispersive
X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (ZSX PRIMUS Primus, Rigaku). Calibration
of the equipment was carried out using standards containing ruthenium
with different concentrations. The net intensity (peak-background)
of the standards was used for calibration, and ruthenium contents
in the catalyst samples were obtained from the calibration curve.

4 Results and Discussion
The homogeneous macromolecular
ligand (TPP), ruthenium-containing
porphyrin complex (Ru-TPP), and heterogenized Ru-TPP complex (Ru-TPP–SBA-X)
were characterized using various analytical and spectroscopic techniques.
Ru-TPP and heterogenized ruthenium porphyrin served as potential catalysts
for the carbonylation of epichlorohydrin using CO2, under
moderate reaction conditions.

The FT-IR spectra (Figure 1) of TPP and the corresponding
ruthenium complex (Ru-TPP)
show characteristic bands in the region of 4000–450 cm–1. For TPP, most of the bands appear in the region
of 450–970 cm–1 because of the in-plane bending,
out-of-plane bending, ring rotation, and ring torsion modes of the
TPP skeleton. Additionally, the sharp vibrational bands observed at
3342 and 1595 cm–1 correspond to N–H stretching
and symmetric angular deformation in the N–H plane of the pyrrole
ring. The incorporation of the ruthenium ion into TPP is supported
by the disappearance of these two sharp bands. The above fact confirms
that the metal ion is covalently bonded to the nitrogen present in
TPP. After ruthenium incorporation, a new shoulder peak was observed
at 462 cm–1 which corresponds to the Ru–N
bond.61 In addition, there are characteristic
shifts in bands from 1472 cm–1 (TPP) to 1483 cm–1 (Ru-TPP) and from 1175 cm–1 (TPP)
to 1230 cm–1 (Ru-TPP). This may be because of the
coordination of TPP to the Ru center.55 Furthermore, 1H NMR studies support the formation of
Ru-TPP (Table 1). The
characteristic peak at −2.74 ppm, which is in the highly shielded
region, corresponds to the N–H protons of TPP, and the peak
is absent in Ru-TPP (Supporting Information Figure S1).62 Therefore, it is confirmed
that Ru is bonded to the nitrogen center of TPP. The other peaks,
being characteristic of the phenyl porphyrin framework, remain identical
for both the TPP ligand (Supporting Information Figure S2) and the Ru-TPP complex. 13C NMR spectral studies
show peaks at 120 (meso-carbon), 127, 126, 142 (phenyl carbon), and
134 ppm (pyrrolic carbon), which are again identical for both TPP
and Ru-TPP. The formation of Ru-TPP was further confirmed by mass
spectral analysis. In the mass spectrum of Ru-TPP, the parent ion
peak appeared at 788.37 (calculated m/z value = 786.07), corresponding to Ru-TPP [C44H28Cl2N4Ru+4H+] (Figure
S3 in Supporting Information). The successful
formation of Ru-TPP was further confirmed by CHN analysis (Table 1), where the theoretical
and experimental values are in agreement with each other.

The
UV–vis spectrum (Figure 2) of TPP shows peaks at 424 (Soret band), 517, 550,
591, and 649 nm (Q bands), characteristic of the porphyrin macromolecular
structure. Upon Ru ion incorporation, the pyrrole nitrogen of TPP
is coordinated to the Ru ion to form a Ru-TPP complex. Consequently,
the intensities of the Q bands at 517 and 550 nm were decreased and
those at 591 and 649 nm disappeared.62 This
trend could be because of the improved structural symmetry (D4h point group) and lowered
energy gap of the Ru-TPP complex compared to that of TPP (D2h point group). After thorough
characterization, the homogeneous catalysts were grafted on the surface
of the functionalized SBA-15 and were characterized systematically
by various spectral and analytical techniques.

Figure 2 UV–vis spectra
of (a) TPP and (b) Ru-TPP.

The FT-IR and 13C MAS NMR spectra were used to confirm
the covalent grafting of the Ru-TPP complex on the surface of the
functionalized SBA-15 material. The FT-IR spectra (Figure 1) show a vibration band at
2934 cm–1, which corresponds to the C–H stretching
of the aliphatic groups of the silane moiety. The peaks which appeared
at 1659, 1477, and 694 nm correspond to the NH2 wagging
modes of the amine and diamine groups on the functionalized SBA-15
material. All the spectra displayed the typical band characteristics
of Si–O–Si stretching, which appeared around 1080–1200,
and 458 cm–1 which is indicative of the binding
modes of vibration. Therefore, the molecular structure was intact
after the immobilization of Ru-TPP on the functionalized SBA-15. The 13C NMR spectra (Figure 3) of the diaminosilane-grafted Ru-TPP showed peaks at 8.2
(C1), 19.6 (C2), 36.8 (C3), 42.4
(C5), and 51 ppm (C6), which correspond to the
aliphatic carbon functionalities arising from the diaminosilane linker.
Similarly, aminosilane- and iodosilane-grafted Ru-TPP show peaks at
14.2 (C1), 28.8 (C2), and 49.00 (C3) ppm corresponding to the aliphatic
carbon functionalities of the aminosilane and iodosilane linkers;56−60 all the grafted samples show peaks at 150, 137, 140, 133, 125, 128,
and 122 ppm which are characteristic of TPP.56

Figure 3 13C MAS NMR spectra of (a) Ru-TPP–SBA-D, (b)
Ru-TPP–SBA-A, and (c)Ru-TPP–SBA-I.

The incorporation of bulk Ru-TPP was evident from the low-angle
powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern as well as the decrease in
the surface area and pore volume, which is observed in N2 sorption studies. The low-angle XRD patterns of Ru-TPP grafted on
various functionalized SBA-15 materials are shown in Figure 4. All the samples show the
typical peaks of the SBA-15 structure with decreasing relative intensities
as well as broadened X-ray reflections. Pure SBA-15 shows X-ray reflections
around 2θ values of 0.85, 1.51, and 1.73, corresponding to the
(100), (110), and (200) planes of the hexagonal mesoporous structure.
Incorporation of bulk Ru-TPP into functionalized SBA-15 leads to a
shift in 2θ values that corresponds to the (100) plane at 1.05,
1.08, and 0.95 for Ru-TPP–SBA-I, Ru-TPP–SBA-D, and Ru-TPP–SBA-A,
respectively. The observed shift in the 2θ value supports the
fact that bulk Ru-TPP was incorporated on the surface of the functionalized
SBA-15.

N2 sorption isotherms (Figure 5) of Ru-TPP grafted on the functionalized
SBA-15 exhibit a typical type-IV isotherm as per the IUPAC classification.
A well-defined, sharp inflection shows the uptake of N2 in the relative pressure range of 0.6–0.8 because of the
capillary condensation of N2 inside the primary mesoporous
sample. Ru-TPP–SBA-D, Ru-TPP–SBA-A, and Ru-TPP–SBA-I
show a drastic decrease in the surface area and pore volume (Table 2), compared to the
parent sample (SBA-15); this confirms that Ru-TPP was encapsulated
in the mesoporous channels of the functionalized SBA-15.

Further, the pore size distribution
is shown in the range of 4–7
nm, which supports the intactness of mesoporosity, and is useful for
molecular diffusion. The SEM image (Figure 6) confirms the hexagonal morphology, which
is retained even after the grafting of Ru-TPP; the presence of an
organometallic complex is confirmed by the surface roughness, and
EDAX shows the presence of ruthenium ions in the grafted material.

To understand the surface environment of the Ru-TPP
complex, 29Si NMR spectra of SBA-15, SBA-15-A, and Ru-TPP–SBA-A
were studied (Figure S4). Pure SBA-15 displays
three broad resonances with the chemical shifts between −110
and −97 ppm, which can be assigned to the Q4, Q3, and Q2 species58−60 of the silica framework
of Qn = Si(OSi)n(OH)4–n. The 29Si NMR spectra of a representative heterogenized sample (Ru-TPP–SBA-A)
show two peaks around −67 and −110 ppm, which correspond
to the T and Q sites of silicon.58−60 The stronger signal
at −110 ppm corresponds to the Q4 sites, indicating
the complete condensation of organosilane with the surface silanol
groups. The peak that appeared around −67 ppm corresponds to
the T3 sites, which are due to the covalent bonding of
the organosilane on the SBA-15 surface. The 29Si NMR spectrum
of SBA-15 is similar to those of heterogenized samples because the
chemical environment of silicon remains unchanged upon the metallocomplex
grafting.58−60 The above studies confirmed that the introduction
of Ru-TPP on the surface of functional molecular sieves does not affect
the framework environment.

The stability of the Ru-TPP complex
and the heterogenized samples
was followed by TGA. The TGA curves for Ru-TPP, Ru-TPP–SBA-D,
Ru-TPP–SBA-I, and Ru-TPP–SBA-A are shown in Figure  S5
(Supporting Information). TGA of Ru-TPP
shows [see Supporting Information Figure
S5a] two distinguishable weight losses in the temperature range of
200–350 and 350–575 °C, respectively, and no weight
loss till 200 °C; this suggests that the complex is stable up
to 200 °C. The first-stage weight loss of about 9% is due to
the decomposition of axial ligands, and the second-stage weight loss
of about 80 wt % in the temperature range of 350–575 °C
is due to the decomposition of the macrocyclic porphyrin units. In
the case of heterogenized catalysts (Ru-TPP–SBA-A, Ru-TPP–SBA-I,
Ru-TPP–SBA-D) [see Supporting Information Figure S5b], there is no appreciable weight loss till 200 °C,
which suggests that the Ru-TPP-grafted samples are stable up to 200
°C. Furthermore, there is no distinguishable weight loss for
the organic linker and the metallocomplex, which suggests that the
Ru-TPP macromolecule is strongly grafted on the surface of the functionalized
SBA-15.

5 Catalytic Studies
Ru-TPP and heterogenized
Ru-TPP-immobilized materials were fully
characterized, and their catalytic activities were assessed using
the carbonylation of epichlorohydrin in liquid phase by CO2 (Scheme 4).

The reaction was performed at different temperatures and times
using a homogeneous catalyst (Ru-TPP), and the reaction conditions
were optimized. The controlled experiment at different reaction intervals
was carried out for both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts (see Figure S6), and the complete conversion of epoxide
was evident around 7–8 h. The effect of the reaction temperature
on the catalytic activity and product selectivity is shown in Figure 7. The complete conversion
of epichlorohydrin was evident even at 80 °C, with the exclusive
formation of the carbonylated product. The formation of the carbonylated
product was confirmed by GC–MS (see Supporting Information Figure S7) and FT-IR spectra (Figure 8). The FT-IR spectra show the
peak corresponding to the C=O stretching at 1798 cm–1, which is characteristic of cyclic carbonates.63 The increase in the reaction temperature facilitates the
formation of ring-opened products.

reaction over Ru-TPP
(reaction conditions: Ru-TPP (catalyst) = 0.01 g (0.0126 mmol), reactant
= 30 mmol, 2 mL, 4 bar CO2 pressure, and 8 h).

Figure 8 FT-IR spectra of the carbonylated product obtained by the reaction:
(A) epichlorohyrin and (B) carbonylated product [(4-chloromethyl)-1,3-dioxane-2.

The activation energy of the reaction with the
Ru-TPP catalyst
was determined by examining the carbonylation reaction at different
temperatures and times. Furthermore, a straight line with a negative
slope was obtained by plotting the log of the concentration of the
reactant versus time, which corresponds to the first-order reaction.
The best fit of the experimental data was found by using a first-order
kinetics (Figure 9)
model with respect to epichlorohydrin (substrate). The studies were
repeated at various temperatures and times, and the rate constants
were calculated using the first-order equation (see Supporting Information, Table S1, for the rate constant calculation).
The rate constants were found to be 0.0068, 0.0091, and 0.0092 s–1 at 80, 100, and 120 °C, respectively. The activation
energy was then calculated from the Arrhenius equation as follows

To obtain the activation energy,
each combination of the rate constants
was used to calculate the mean activation energy, which was estimated
to be 16.07 kJ mol–1. Furthermore, it was found
that the Ru-TPP catalyst could efficiently catalyze the carbonylation
of epichlorohydrin with the highest turnover number (TON) of 2335
when the reaction was conducted for 8 h using 0.0127 mmol of catalyst;
the catalytic activity of homogeneous catalysts was further continued
by only introducing an additional 30 mmol of epichlorohydrin for four
subsequent runs (Table 3). It was evident that the substrate conversion decreased steadily
over the period of runs (Table 3, as also evident from the TON of individual runs), and the
total TON of about 5924 was evident after four cycles.

a Reaction conditions:
Ru-TPP (catalyst)
= 0.01 g (0.0126 mmol), reactant = 30 mmol (2 mL), 4 bar CO2 pressure, 80 °C, and 8 h. TON = no of moles of a reactant consumed
in a reaction/no of moles of a catalyst.

A further catalytic study was carried out with heterogeneous
catalysts,
that is, heterogenized Ru-TPP catalysts. Both diamino- and iodo-functionalized
heterogeneous catalysts showed excellent conversions but poor selectivity
for the carbonylated product at 80 °C (Figure 10a). As the temperature increased to 100
°C, the iodo- and amino-functionalized heterogeneous catalysts
(Ru-TPP–SBA-I and Ru-TPP–SBA-A) facilitated the complete
conversion with the exclusive formation of the carbonylated product
(Figure 10b), and
the catalytic activity remained nearly constant up to four cycles
(Table 4). In particular,
the homogeneous (Ru-TPP) and heterogeneous catalysts (i.e., Ru-TPP–SBA-A
and Ru-TPP–SBA-I) retained their catalytic activity for several
cycles (Tables 3 and 4), whereas in the case of Ru-TPP–SBA-D, the
activity drastically decreased in each cycle (see Table S2), which may be because of the steric hindrance results
from the bulkier diaminosilane functionality, leading to the weak
interaction of Ru-TPP and SBA-D. In the first cycle, the catalyst
(Ru-TPP–SBA-D) showed 92% conversion with the formation of
an 83.8% carbonylated product, and the activity was drastically decreased
to 23% in the subsequent cycles (see Table S2 in the Supporting Information). Thus, further studies only focus
on using Ru-TPP, Ru-TPP–SBA-A and Ru-TPP–SBA-I catalysts.
The ruthenium content present in the heterogeneous catalysts was calculated
using the XRF technique, and it shows about 0.38, 0.12, and 0.03 wt
% of Ru in Ru-TPP–SBA-A, Ru-TPP–SBA-I, and Ru-TPP–SBA-D,
respectively. The corresponding TON of these heterogeneous catalysts
was found to be 9170 (Ru-TPP–SBA-A), 25 000 (Ru-TPP–SBA-I),
and 81 176 (Ru-TPP–SBA-D).

The plausible
mechanism for carbonylation is given in Scheme 5. In the present
reaction system, the ring opening of epichlorohydrin was facilitated
by the ruthenium center, followed by the reaction with CO2 and subsequent ring closure to produce the corresponding carbonate.
The presence of any acidic functionality led to the formation of hydroxylated
chloropropane (1,3-dicholoropropane-2-ol), as shown in the mechanism
(step 2). The selectivity of the hydroxylated product was increased
by the use of the heterogeneous catalyst, probably because of the
residual surface hydroxyl functionalities present in the functionalized
SBA-15. The homogeneous Ru-TPP and the highly active heterogeneous
catalysts were studied for various scopes of the substrate, and the
results are summarized in Table 5. Irrespective of the cyclic ring size, the complete
conversion of cyclic epoxide into the corresponding carbonate was
evident.

a Reaction conditions: Ru-TPP (homogeneous
catalyst) = 0.01 g, reactant = 30 mmol (2 mL), 4 bar CO2 pressure, 80 °C, and 8 h; Ru-TPP–SBA-I/Ru-TPP–SBA-A
(heterogeneous catalyst) = 0.1 g, reactant = 30 mmol (2 mL), 4 bar
CO2 pressure, 100 °C, and 8 h.

After the reaction, the structure
of the heterogenized catalyst
remains intact, and it is evident from the 13C-MAS NMR
spectra of the used catalysts (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). The spectra show peaks at 150, 137,
140, 133, 125, 128, and 122 ppm that are characteristic of TPP and
at 14.2, 28.8, and 49.00 ppm, corresponding to the aliphatic carbon
functionalities of the aminosilane and iodosilane linkers. To check
the metal leaching from the heterogenized catalysts, the hot filtration
test was carried out by filtering the catalyst after treating the
catalyst and the reactant at 100 °C under atmospheric conditions
for 2 h. Subsequently, the reaction was studied using a filtrate solution
under a CO2 atmosphere (see Supporting Information in Table S3). The catalysts Ru-TPP–SBA-A
and Ru-TPP–SBA-I showed about 1.2 and 1.7% conversions on the
filtrate solution, confirming that there is no leaching of the Ru-TPP
complex from the heterogeneous surface. In addition, the catalytic
activities of our catalytic systems were compared with some of the
recent literature reports on similar systems (Table S4). Our catalysts clearly showed similar activity and
good cyclic carbonate selectivity, even at a relatively low pressure,
when compared with previous studies.

6 Conclusions
Ruthenium-containing tetraphenylporphyrin (Ru-TPP) molecule was
prepared for the first time and grafted on various functionalized
SBA-15, such as amino-, diamino-, and iodo-functionalized SBA-15 materials.
The structural elucidation was confirmed by 1H NMR, FT-IR,
CHN, and mass spectral analyses. The grafting of Ru-TPP on functionalized
mesoporous molecular sieve materials was evident from low-angle powder
XRD, 13C MAS NMR, N2 sorption, and SEM–EDAX
analyses. The high thermal stability of the homogeneous as well as
heterogeneous catalysts was evident from TGA. The resultant homogeneous
(Ru-TPP) and heterogenized Ru-TPP (Ru-TPP–SBA-X) catalysts
were used for CO2 utilization at moderate reaction conditions.
The carbonylation reaction by Ru-TPP, the homogeneous catalyst, follows
first-order kinetics with respect to epoxide, with the exclusive formation
of cyclic carbonate, and the energy of activation is much lower compared
to the reported catalysts.64 Ru-TPP grafted
on aminosilane- and iodosilane-functionalized materials shows promising
catalytic activity and reusability for carbonylation. Further, the 13C MAS NMR spectra of used catalysts show that the structure
of the catalysts remains intact even after several runs.
