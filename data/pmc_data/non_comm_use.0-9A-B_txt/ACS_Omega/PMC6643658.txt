Poly(trimethylene
terephthalate) (PTT)/silica nanocomposite films
were successfully fabricated using a novel sol–gel approach.
The synthesis of these nanocomposites is being carried out by hydrolysis
and condensation of tetraethoxysilane using trifluoroacetic acid with
a small amount of water. The scanning electron microscopy and zetasizer
result showed that the silica particles with a size range of 80–100
nm were homogeneously dispersed in the PTT matrix. The effect of different
amounts of silica on crystallization of PTT was investigated using
X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and optical
microscopy. Polarized light microscopic results revealed that the
spherulite size gradually decreased with increasing silica loading
and increased with crystallization temperature for a given nanocomposite
during isothermal melt crystallization. PTT with a small amount of
SiO2 melt crystallized at low temperatures showed banded
spherulites. DSC results revealed that nonisothermal cold crystallization
temperature decreased with silica content, whereas no significant
change in nonisothermal melt crystallization behavior was observed
with silica content. The crystallinity of isothermally melt crystallized
PTT increased with both crystallization temperature and silica loading.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Poly(trimethylene terephthalate)
(PTT) is an aromatic polyester
with three methylene groups in the glycol unit joining other aromatic
polyesters such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(butylene
terephthalate) (PBT). PTT has better elastic recovery and low modulus
than PET, PBT, and polyamide 6, and it is an ideal candidate for soft
and stretchable fibers.1−5 PTT was first synthesized in 1941 using propane diol and dimethyl
terephthalate. It was not commercially available until 1998 due to
the cost of propane diol. DuPont and Shell Chemical introduced new
ways to make propane diol that leads to the commercialization of PTT
and fundamental research of PTT. PTT has also been used in optical
communications, optical data processing, and nonlinear optics. Melt
crystallization and cold crystallization of PTT have been investigated,
and conformational and morphological changes during crystallization
were conducted by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and
optical microscopy.5−11

Polymer nanocomposites derived from nanoscale additives and
polymer
matrix became interesting new type of composite materials. Several
methods such as melt blending, intercalation, and in situ intercalative
polymerization have been used for the preparation of these nanocomposites.12−20 Among them, montmorillonite clay,12−19 carbon nanotubes,20 and SiO2 nanoparticles21−28 are commonly used as nanofillers. The crystallization behavior of
semicrystalline polymers in the presence of nanofillers has been investigated
extensively;29−35 and studies have shown that nanoparticles can influence the flow,
crystallization, and the final morphology of the polymer. The characteristics
of polymer nanocomposites depend on the type of interaction between
nanoparticles and the polymer matrix.36−39 It has been demonstrated that
dispersion of nanoparticles plays a significant role in mechanical,
physical, and crystallization behavior of polymer nanocomposites.

The polymer/silica nanocomposites were prepared recently by the
in situ sol–gel reactions.33−40 It has been shown that silica derived from silicon precursors enhance
physical and mechanical properties of polymers. The sol–gel
syntheses of organic–inorganic nanocomposites are being carried
out using silane-coupling agents such as alkoxy silanes as precursors.
Alkoxy groups hydrolyze during sol–gel process in the presence
of water and form cross-link network. PTT/silica nanocomposite was
prepared via the sol–gel technique and in situ polymerization.26 It has been shown that PTT chains were grafted
on the surface of silica. PTT nanocomposite prepared by this technique
showed high mechanical properties. This study reports the synthesis
of PTT/silica nanocomposites using an in situ sol–gel process
using PTT and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). The effect of silica on isothermal
and nonisothermal melt crystallization of PTT was investigated. The
novelty of this work lies on that the silica nanoparticles were created
within the PTT phase for the first time using the solvent for PTT.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of PTT
Nanocomposites
The sol–gel method is an efficient
method to prepare inorganic
networks. It offers several advantages such as controlling particle
size by optimizing conditions such as pH, concentration, and temperature.
In the present study, PTT/silica nanocomposites with varying amount
of TEOS (1–10 wt %) were fabricated using the sol–gel
technique by adding silica precursor to PTT trifluoroacetic acid solution
contained 10 wt % water. The dispersion of silica particles in the
PTT matrix was determined to understand the physical and mechanical
properties and morphology of PTT nanocomposites. Figure 1 illustrates scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of PTT nanocomposites containing 5 wt % TEOS
by weight at two different magnifications along with SEM image of
PTT nanocomposites containing 10 wt % TEOS by weight. These SEM micrographs
clearly show that nanoscale spherical silica particles were homogenously
distributed within the PTT matrix. However, SEM image of PTT containing
10 wt % TEOS shows aggregation of SiO2 nanoparticles. Silica
particle size of 80–100 nm was determined using SEM. The effect
of silica loading on polymer molecular weight was investigated using
viscosity measurement using trifluoric acid as solvent. No significant
change in molecular weight was observed. PTT/silica nanocomposites
were recently prepared by the traditional two-stage melt poly-condensation
method.26 It was shown by FTIR and NMR
spectroscopy that PTT chains were grafted on the surface of silica
particles. It was also reported that molecular weight of PTT gradually
decreased with increasing silica content. The decrease in viscosity
average molecular weight was attributed to the small amount of ethanol
produced during polymerization.

Figure 1 SEM images of PTT nanocomposite with 5
wt % TEOS at two different
magnifications (a, b) and PTT nanocomposite with 10 wt % TEOS (c).

The size of the prepared silica
particles was further determined
using zetasizer instrument. To determine the size of the SiO2 particles, PTT nanocomposites films were dissolved in trifluoroacetic
acid and filtered through the membrane filter to separate SiO2 particles from the polymer. Silica particles were then suspended
in a solvent and stirred for 30 min. The average size of the particles
was determined as 80 nm, shown in Figure 2. It is in good agreement with our SEM findings.
These PTT nanocomposite films were then characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD). The presence of SiO2 particles within the PTT polymer
matrix was not confirmed by XRD. XRD pattern of neat SiO2 shows a broad reflection at ∼2θ = 25, suggesting amorphous
phase of silica. It was absent in the XRD pattern of PTT nanocomposites
due to low concentration.

Figure 2 Particle size analysis report of the silica
particles stirred for
3 h.

The effect of the nanoparticles
on the crystal structure of PTT
was further investigated by XRD. A single crystal form has been identified
for PTT.40−42 The unit cell of this crystal form was identified
as triclinic, with a = 4.637, b =
6.226, c = 18.64 Å, α = 98.4°, β
= 93°, and γ = 111.5°. The XRD results showed that
PTT crystal form is not affected by the presence of nanoparticles,
but a significant change in crystallinity of PTT nanocomposite compared
to neat PTT was observed.

2.2 Crystallization Studies
of PTT/SiO2 Nanocomposite by Optical Microscopy
The effect of silica
on morphology of melt crystallized pure PTT and its nanocomposites
was studied by optical microscopy. It is clear from optical micrographs
that both the melt crystallization temperature and the silica content
influence the morphology of melt crystallized PTT. Figure 3 shows the optical micrographs
of PTT/SiO2 nanocomposite melt crystalized at 120, 150,
and 180 °C for 30 min. Optical micrograph of neat PTT crystallized
at 120 °C shows a well-defined spherulite morphology without
banded structures roughly about 200 microns. In contrast, a significantly
different morphology was observed for PTT with 1 and 2 wt % TEOS.
Spherulites with banded structures are seen for PTT nanocomposites
with 1 and 2 wt % TEOS, and these banded structures disappeared when
the TEOS content increased more than 2%. Figure 3A clearly shows that the spherulite size
decreases with increasing TEOS content, suggesting heterogeneous nucleation
in the presence of silica. As a result, the number of spherulites
increased with increasing silica content. Similar observation was
made for PTT nanocomposites crystallized at 150 and 180 °C, but
there were no banded structures observed at these crystallization
temperatures.

Figure 3 Optical micrographs of PTT nanocomposite films with different
amounts
of TEOS: (a) neat PTT, (b) 1%, (c) 3%, (d) 5%, and (e) 10% melt crystallized
(A) 120 °C, (B) 150 °C, (C) 180 °C.

Effect of melt crystallization temperature on spherulitic
morphology
of PTT was studied previously.5,43,44 It was apparent that spherulite size increased with increasing crystallization
temperature for both neat PTT and PTT nanocomposites. Figure 4 displays PTT with 5 wt % TEOS
melt crystallized at 120, 150, and 180 °C for 30 min. The orientation
of the crystalline lamella along or perpendicular to the spherulite
radius is evident from Maltese cross pattern. It can also be seen
that the spherulite size increases with increasing melt crystallization
temperature, indicating a slower crystallization rate at higher temperature.18 The spherulite size of melt crystallized PTT
nanocomposite with 5 wt % TEOS at 120 to 150 to 180 °C increases
from about 50 to 70 to 100 μm, respectively. It was observed
that the introduction of higher loadings of silica at higher melt
crystallization temperatures forms smaller spherulites. This suggests
that silica particles act as nucleating agent and form larger number
of nuclei. Since larger number of nuclei forms simultaneously within
a limited space, spherulites grow smaller.

Figure 4 Optical micrographs of
PTT nanocomposite with 5% TEOS melt crystallized
at (a)120 °C, (b) 150 °C, (c) 180 °C.

PTT crystallized from the melt was studied by optical
microscopy
and shown that PTT exhibits three crystallization regimes I, II, III.
PTT forms axialites or elliptically shaped spherulites in regime I
and changes to banded and nonbanded spherulites in regime II and III,
respectively.44 The banded spherulites
were dominant at crystallization temperature above 195 °C (regime
II) and the banded morphology disappears at crystallization temperature
below 195 °C, in good agreement with our previous observation.5 In the present study, banded spherulites were
seen for PTT nanocomposites with small amount of SiO2 at
120 °C. Bands in these spherulites appear to be in regular interval
with dark and bright bands. It is clear that nanoparticle plays similar
role as higher melt crystallization temperature due to decrease in
rate of crystallization and heterogeneous nucleation.

2.3 Thermal Characterization of the PTT/Silica
Nanocomposite
It is well known that the crystallization plays
a significant role in the properties of polymer nanocomposites.18−24 Therefore, the effects of SiO2 on isothermal and nonisothermal
melt crystallization and cold crystallization behavior of PTT nanocomposites
were investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
Thermal properties obtained from DSC scans are listed in Table 1. The weight loss
measurement of neat PTT and its nanocomposites with varying amounts
of silica as a function of temperature was carried out using thermogravimetric
analysis to determine thermal stability. The amount silica determined
in each PTT nanocomposite is also given in Table 1. The DSC curves of amorphous PTT and PTT
nanocomposite films nonisothermally cold crystallized at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min are depicted in Figure 5a. The melting curve of nonisothermally cold-crystallized
PTT/SiO2 nanocomposites is shown in Figure 5b.

TEOS loadings from 30 to 100 °C (a) neat PTT, (b) 3%, (c) 5%,
(d) 10%. (b) DSC heating scans of PTT nanocomposite films with different
TEOS loadings: from 100 to 180 °C (a) neat PTT, (b) 3%, (c) 5%,

Table 1 DSC Data of Neat
PTT and Its Nanocomposites
Derived from First Heating Scans
sample	SiO2 content (wt %)	Tcc (°C)	Tm (°C)	ΔHc (J/g)	
PTT	0	56	217	30	
PTT/3%TEOS	0.9	46	218	25	
PTT/5%TEOS	1.4	41	219	19	
PTT/10%TEOS	2.5	42	218	17	
The DSC scan of neat PTT amorphous film in Figure 5a showed two transitions
that were attributed
to glass-transition temperature (Tg at
45 °C) and a cold crystallization temperature (Tcc at 56 °C). The Tg of
PTT nanocomposites is not seen in their DSC scans, suggesting that
the incorporation of nanoparticles in the PTT matrix does influence
the Tg of PTT. The Tcc of PTT nanocomposites was observed at lower temperatures
compared to neat PTT, and the Tcc appeared
to decrease with the increasing SiO2 content. For example,
the Tcc is shifted to 46 °C for PTT
nanocomposite with 1% TEOS, and the Tcc is shifted to 41 °C for PTT nanocomposite with 10% TEOS. The
heat of nonisothermal cold crystallization exotherm (ΔHcc) of neat PTT is found to be 30.0 J/g, whereas
the ΔHcc of PTT nanocomposite with
10% TEOS is found to be 17.0 J/g. It is clear that the ΔHcc decreases with TEOS loading. This is probably
due to inability of PTT chains to be incorporated within the crystals
because of faster cold crystallization rate. Similar studies were
conducted for PTT/clay nanocomposites to show the effect of clay on
morphology of PTT.16 It was shown that
the Tcc increased with increasing clay
content, suggesting lower crystallization rate. The decrease in crystallization
rate with addition of clay in PTT nanocomposites was attributed to
the interaction between the PTT chain and clay preventing the mobility
of the PTT chains.16 A slight increase
in the melting temperature (Tm) of PTT
with the increasing TEOS content was observed.

Nonisothermal
melt crystallization of PTT and its nanocomposites
with different TEOS loadings was investigated at a cooling rate of
10 °C/min. Figure 6 shows the DSC cooling curves of PTT nanocomposites from the melt.
In the case of neat PTT, nonisothermal melt crystallization peak, Tc, appears around 202 °C; however, Tc shifts to slightly lower temperature in the
presence of SiO2. Finally, isothermal melt crystallization
of PTT nanocomposites was carried out at 120, 150, and 180 °C
in an oven for 30 min. Figure 7 shows the DSC heating scans of PTT nanocomposites with varying
amounts of TEOS melt crystallized at 150 °C, and similar patterns
were observed for PTT nanocomposites melt crystallized at 120 and
180 °C. It is clear from the Figure 7 that the melting temperature of PTT increased
with increasing SiO2 content at all melt crystallization
temperatures studied. Melting endotherm shows two peaks, and they
are attributed to bimodal distribution of crystallites. The increase
in melting temperature with silica content is attributed to lamella
thickness increase due to increase in crystallinity. Figure 8 shows the crystallinity of
PTT nanocomposites melt crystallized at different temperatures (120,
150, and 190 °C) for 30 min. Crystallinity (χc) values for pure PTT and its nanocomposites were determined using
the heat of fusion (ΔHo) value of
100% crystalline PTT. It should be noted that the heat of fusion of
a perfect PTT crystal was multiplied by the fraction of PTT in each
sample. The crystallinity values increased slowly with crystallization
temperature (Tc), whereas the crystalline
fraction (χc) increased rapidly with the increasing
SiO2 content, indicating that PTT crystallizes more in
the presence of SiO2.

3 Conclusions
PTT/SiO2 nanocomposites were synthesized via the novel
sol–gel reaction between TEOS and PTT. X-ray diffraction and
scanning electron microscopy techniques revealed the formation of
these nanocomposites. It was found that the size of the silica nanoparticles
in the PTT matrix was about 80–100 nm. SEM results confirmed
that the dispersion of nanoparticles is uniform up to 5% silica content,
and nonuniform dispersion was apparent for those containing more than
5% silica content.

The introduction of silica nanoparticles
on crystallization behavior
of PTT nanocomposite was investigated using DSC. Crystallinity of
PTT nanocomposites increased with TEOS content compared to neat PTT.
It was found that the size of the spherulites depends on the crystallization
temperature as well as the silica content. The spherulite size increased
when the crystallization temperature increased from 120 to 180 °C,
whereas the spherulite size decreased with increasing TEOS content
at a given crystallization temperature, suggesting that the addition
of silica modifies the crystallization behavior of PTT.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Poly(trimethylene
terephthalate)
pellets with weight and the number average molecular weight about
78 000 and 34 000 g/mol, respectively, were received
from DuPont, and its viscosity of 0.85 dL/g was measured in dichloroacetic
acid at 23 °C. The molecular weight distribution was approximately
2.0. Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. All of the chemicals were used without further
purification.

4.2 Preparation of Polymer/Silica
Nanocomposite
PTT pellets (0.5 g) were placed in a beaker,
and 36.0 mL of trifluoroacetic
acid and 4.0 mL of water were added. The pellets were dissolved at
low temperature with continuous stirring until the pellets were dissolved
completely. Once all of the pellets were dissolved, amounts of 10,
5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 wt % tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) were added and stirred
until the solution becomes clear. The solution was allowed to dry
for about 24 h at room temperature. After 24 h, the fully dried samples
were triturated to fine powder using mortar and pestle and stored
in the desiccator.

Neat PTT and PTT nanocomposites amorphous
films were prepared using following procedure: 0.158 g of fine powder
was sandwiched between two Teflon sheets and melt pressed at 260 °C
and held 10 000 lb pressure for 5 min and subsequently transferred
to an oven preheated to the desired crystallization temperatures (Tc): 120–180 °C for 30 min for crystallization.

4.3 Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Thermal
properties of neat PTT and PTT/silica nanocomposites were
measured using a TA Instruments Differential Scanning Calorimeter
Q2000. Indium and zinc standards were employed for temperature and
heat of fusion calibration. The glass-transition temperature, melting
temperature, and cold crystallization temperature of melt crystallized
PTT and its nanocomposites crystallized at various temperatures were
obtained by heating the sample from 30 to 250 °C at a rate of
10 °C/min. Nonisothermal melt crystallization of PTT nanocomposites
was carried out by heating from 30 to 260 °C at a heating rate
of 10 °C/min, held at 260 °C for 5 min, and then cooled
from 260 to 25 °C at a cooling rate of 10 °C/min. Nonisothermal
cold crystallization of PTT nanocomposites was carried out by heating
from 30 to 260 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. 3–5
mg was used and onset values were taken as melting, cold crystallization,
and nonisothermal melt crystallization temperatures. Integration of
melting peak was carried out between 195 and 235 °C to determine
heat of fusion. The crystalline fraction was determined using the
equation below.  Where ΔHm is heat of fusion of
the sample, ΔHcc is heat of cold
crystallization, and ΔHo is heat
of fusion of 100% crystalline polymer and x is the
wt % TEOS. Heat of fusion of 100% crystalline polymer
PTT was taken as 145.63 J/g.6−10

4.4 Microscopy
Morphology of melt crystallized
PTT and PTT nanocomposite films was examined using a Nikon polarized
optical microscope equipped with a 35 mm Minolta X-700 camera. PTT
nanocomposite film samples were prepared by placing a piece of film
between a glass slide and cover slip. The spot advanced program was
used to take all photographs and measurements of the samples. Scanning
electron microscopy images were examined using a field-emission scanning
electron microscope with Oxford EDS Detector (FESEM-EDS) using a 5
kV accelerating voltage at New Jersey Institute of Technology. Images
were recorded from the surface of cry-fractured samples coated with
silver for enhanced conductivity.

4.5 X-ray
Diffraction (XRD)
XRD scans
of PTT nanocomposites were obtained at room temperature using the
Scintag X1 Advanced Diffraction System equipped with Ni-filtered Cu
Kα radiation as a source of radiation. The copper anode generates
a desired radiation of 1.54 A, and the samples were scanned at room
temperature from 5 to 60° at the rate of 2.4°/min with a
step size of 0.020°.

4.6 Zeta Seizer Analysis
Malvern zeta
seizer was used to analyze the samples for the size of the particles.
About 1 mL of nanosuspension was placed in a vial and inserted into
the slot for measurement in zeta seizer. It works on the principle
of dynamic light scattering technique. It is an ideal technique for
measurement of size of nanoparticles without perturbation for convenient
size analysis. Dynamic light scattering works on the principle that
particles in solution are in constant thermal motion called Brownian
motion, which is dependent on the size and temperature of the particles.
This diffusion speed is measured by illuminating the particles with
a laser and the scattering intensity of light will fluctuate at a
particular angle, which is detected by a photodiode array detector.
Intensity changes are given as a correlation function, which provide
size and size distribution.
