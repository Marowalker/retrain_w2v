Remediation process produces high-value
functional material from
low-cost or valueless waste feedstock. Current research demonstrates
an innovative solvothermal approach to effectively react sulfuric
acid on polyethylene (PE) chains, modifying the PE at a moderate temperature.
In this process, the polymer undergoes a cross-linking step above
120 °C, whereas above 500 °C, it transforms into turbostratic
carbon structures. Scanning electron micrographs confirmed the free-standing
carbon sheet architecture. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction
verified the amorphous/disordered sp2/sp3 hybrid
carbon structure in the produced carbons. A high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area of 752.3 and 673.5 m2/g for low-density PE-derived
carbon (LDPE-C) and high-density PE-derived carbon (HDPE-C), respectively,
was recorded. Thermogravimetric analysis analysis established a total
mass retention of 50 and 46% for LDPE and HDPE, respectively, from
sulfonated materials. Li-ion battery composite anode comprising LDPE-C
and HDPE-C, with a binder and a carbon additive (vs lithium), produced
230 and 350 mA h/g specific capacities for LDPE-C and HDPE-C, respectively,
when cycled at room temperature at C/5 rate. Elevated temperature
(50 °C) battery cycling produced 290 and 440 mA h/g specific
capacities for LDPE-C and HDPE-C, respectively, at C/5 rate. On the
basis of the literature survey, this is the first report, which demonstrates
that a solvothermal sulfonation process followed by thermal treatment
successfully converts waste LDPE and HDPE plastic bags to functional
energy-storing carbons.

==== Body
Introduction
Globally, around 300 million tons of plastic
were produced in 2013
to fulfill the growing demand.1 Soon after,
most of the used plastic (>85%) makes its way to landfill and oceans,
where it takes hundreds of years to decompose into small fragments.2 As plastic slowly degrades with sunlight, it
becomes smaller and starts releasing toxic chemicals into the environment.3 This approach disturbs our ecosystem. In 2014,
Eriksen et al. estimated that at least 5.25 trillion plastic particles
weighing around 269 000 tons4 are
submerged or floating in the sea. Currently, there is an unsustainable
trend, where waste plastics are shipped for recycling to countries
with lower environmental standards.1 However,
this approach is not economical, appealing, or benign for our environment
and the overall ecosystem.

Typically, closed-loop recycling
approach is used in most thermoplastics
because energy recovery from plastics is very poor, air emission controls
are needed, and byproduct ash could be hazardous. Moreover, polyethylene
(PE) with colorants, dyes, labels, and sticky additives5 increases the difficulty in recycling. PE has
been proposed for more than four decades as a low cost (1 $/kg) carbon
precursor with a high (86%) carbon content. In 1972, Saglio et al.
pyrolyzed saturated chlorinated6 PE to
obtain carbon. Zhang and Sun produced carbon fibers7 by reacting ultrahigh molecular weight PE with H2SO4 acid at 180 °C followed by carbonization in the
He atmosphere at 1100 °C, yielding 55 wt % carbon fibers. Recently,
Hameed et al. prepared microporous8 carbon
with high-density PE (HDPE) using H2SO4 at 120
°C and carbonization at 1150 °C under a N2 atmosphere,
obtaining a 51.9 wt % yield. However, with the former methods, carbon
was produced in limited quantities without potential applications.

Hydrothermal carbonization is known to produce carbonaceous materials
from biomass precursors using water.9−12 Because of self-generated pressures
at low temperatures in a hydrothermal system, it resembles the natural
process of coal formation.9 Previously,
dry autoclaving of PE (thermolysis under self-generated pressure at
an elevated temperature in a closed system) produced solid, dense,
low surface area functional carbon spheres. The as-obtained carbon
spheres were studied as lithium-ion battery anodes,13 sodium-ion battery anodes,14 and lubrication additives.15 PE is also
remediated into carbon nanotubes (CNTs)16 via dry autoclaving. Typically, carbonaceous materials are synthesized
from hydrocarbons through expensive and complex multistep processes,
with the special requirement of plasma and reducing gases becoming
complicated to scale-up. Our innovative solvothermal upcycling approach
generates high pressure at a low temperature, which improves PE sulfonation
reproducibly with a high carbon yield. Our solvothermal upcycling
approach totally gets rid of plastic waste, converting them into functional
carbonaceous materials for multiple applications including battery
anodes.

Experimental Section
Low-density PE (LDPE) and HDPE
bags were obtained from Ziploc and
HILEX, respectively. After their general household usage, they are
used as feedstock in our solvothermal process. Concentrated H2SO4 (98%) was obtained from BDH and used as received.

Synthesis
of Sulfonated PEs
Typically, 1 g of LDPE
or HDPE was immersed in 20 mL of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) in a 120 mL capacity Teflon vessel with a Teflon cap. Because
of the dominant sulfuric acid component, we define our process as
solvothermal and not hydrothermal. Sulfuric acid is known to be a
powerful protonating agent, oxidizing agent, and dehydrating agent
(remove or replace molecules from organic compounds). The PE/acid-loaded
Teflon vessel was inserted into a solvothermal Parr reactor and heated
to 110 °C for 12 h, followed by natural cooling to room temperature.
Typically, waste solid PE thermally melts at 115–135 °C,
above which, it transforms into hazardous gases (CO2, CO,
H2O, and CxHy) without converting into a valuable carbon product. To achieve
carbonaceous materials, it is essential to transform some H atoms
of PE chains to SO3H groups. After opening the reactor,
the obtained black sheets and flakes were washed with deionized water
several times to remove the unreacted acid. The obtained sulfonated
flakes were dried overnight at 80 °C, which are named as LDPE-S
and HDPE-S, respectively. After solvothermal synthesis, both sulfonated
materials (LDPE-S and HDPE-S) increase their masses by 28 ± 6
and 23 ± 9%, respectively.

Carbonization of Sulfonated
PEs
In a tubular split
furnace, LDPE-S or HDPE-S was separately carbonized for 2 h in an
alumina crucible inside a quartz tube under Ar flow (200 mL min–1) at 900 °C. The heating and cooling rates were
10 °Cmin-1. The exit of the tube furnace was connected
to a water tap, which collected the formed byproducts during the carbonization
process of sulfonated flakes. Sample yields of carbon products were
weighted after carbonization and named as LDPE-C and HDPE-C. These
carbonaceous materials were then ground in an agate mortar to form
a free-flowing carbon black powder. Carbonization shows a total mass
yield (PE to carbon conversion) of 63 ± 5% for LDPE and 54 ±
3% for HDPE.

Characterization Techniques
Scanning
electron microscopy
(SEM) and elemental mapping were performed by using a JEOL scanning
electron microscope instrument (JCM-6000PLUS, JED-2300 AnalysisStation).
Raman spectra were collected using a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope
with a 633 nm laser; a low laser power of 2 mW was used to avoid sample
burning/modification. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected
using a Riguka SmartLab X-ray diffractometer operated at 40 kV and
40 mA with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154 nm); the
samples were measured from 10° to 80° with a scan rate of
2.5° per minute. Surface area analysis of black carbon powders/sheets
was performed in a Quantachrome Instruments analyzer after outgassing
the materials at 300 °C for 24 h. Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was performed using a thermal analyzer system (i1000, IS Inc.)
with flowing argon gas (99.997%) at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 from room temperature to 1000 °C.

Electrochemical
Tests
Lithium-ion battery anode electrodes
were prepared with 80% of waste PE-derived carbons, 10% of polyvinylidene
difluoride (KYNAR HSV900, Arkema Inc.) binder, and 10% of carbon black
additive (TIMCAL Super P Li). The composite slurry was homogenized
for 20 min by employing a Thinky planetary mixture in the presence
of seven to eight drops of N-methylpyrrolidone at
a constant speed of around 8000 rpm. Using the Dr. Blade technique,17 the slurries were deposited on a battery-grade
copper foil using an MTI laminate coater with approximately 40 μm
thickness, and the obtained foils were dried overnight at 80 °C.
Electrodes of 12 mm diameter were punched out, and CR-2032-type half-coin
cells (MTI Corp) were assembled in a high-purity argon glovebox (NEXUS
II Vacuum Atmospheres Co.) with <1 ppm of O2 and moisture.
Celgard 2500 polypropylene was used as the separator, a lithium metal
foil (MTI Corp) was used as the counter electrode, and 1 M LiPF6 with EC:DMC (1:1) was used as the organic electrolyte.
Cyclic voltammetric analysis was carried out for the fabricated lithium
cells comprising either LDPE-C or HDPE-C derived carbon between 0.005 and 2.0 V at the scan
rate of 0.2 mV s–1 by employing a Gamry 600 potentiostat/galvanostat/ZRA.
Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling was performed using
an Arbin cycler between 0.005 and 2.0 V with a theoretical capacity
of 372 mA h/g, which was used to calculate the corresponding C rates
(1 C = 372 mA/g). For kinetic and cell degradation studies, an elevated
temperature charge–discharge cycling was conducted at 50 °C
in an ESPEC oven.

Results and Discussion
Scheme 1 demonstrates
the novel solvothermal approach for the fabrication of carbon chips
from the used plastic bags and its effective use in lithium-ion battery
anodes. The chemical formula of PE, the solvothermal reactor assembly
comprising acid, inert gas treatment, chiplike morphology of carbon
(artistically decorated), and the prepared coin cells are presented.
Typically, PE thermally melts at 115–135 °C, above which
it transforms into hazardous gases (CO2, CO, H2O, and CxHy) without converting into a valuable carbon product. To methodically
achieve carbonaceous materials, an oxidative dehydrogenation accompanied
by SO3H functionalization is carried out in a solvothermal
Teflon inner lining reactor. Hydrothermal reaction facilitates SO3H functionalization. During the high-temperature treatment,
the removal of sulfonic acid groups takes place followed by cross-linking18 above 500 °C to remove all of the remaining
−H2, −CO, −CO2, −H2O, and SO2 to yield pure carbon. Finally, lithium-ion
coin or button cells were made, and Li-ion storage performance was
studied.

Scheme 1 Solvothermal Process for the Manufacture of Carbon Chips from
Used
Low- and High-Density Plastic Bags, Their Chiplike Morphology, and
Effective Use in Lithium-Ion Battery Anodes
To comprehend the morphology of the obtained carbonaceous
materials,
SEM images and elemental mapping analysis were taken for the LDPE-C
and HDPE-C carbon materials, as described in Figures 1 and 2. The larger
plastic pieces (both LDPE and HDPE) are converted to carbon pieces,
which got fragmented into free-standing carbon sheet/flake architectures
as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The particle width is dependent on
the grinding process. Gentle milling of the obtained LDPE-C and HDPE-C
in an agate mortar with pestle leads to carbon chiplike particles
with several microns width. The thickness of the carbon chips is 25.28
± 4 and 11.86 ± 2.4 μm for LDPE-C and HDPE-C, respectively.
The thickness is dependent on the initial feedstock precursor (LDPE
and HDPE bags) thickness. The observed shrinkage in diameter from
the feedstock waste plastics to the carbon product is approximately
25%. This shrinkage could be explained by the release of molecules
(−H2, −CO, −CO2, −H2O, or SO2) during the elevated temperature treatment.18 Carbon chips prepared from the HDPE yielded
more porous carbon structures compared to LDPE, possibly due to the
thermochemical reaction with inorganic colorants during the elevated
temperature heat treatment. Furthermore, the presence of carbon and
the trace amount of sulfur are measured in the LDPE-C carbon material,
as described in Figure 1c,d. In HDPE, trace amount of colorants is present that leads to
additional impurities, revealed in the XRD (Figure 4b) and elemental mapping (Figure 2d–h) for the obtained
carbon product. As seen in Figure 2c, the carbon obtained from HDPE possesses more than
90% carbon (Figure 2d) and remaining S (Figure 2e), Mg (Figure 2f), Al (Figure 2g),
and O (Figure 2h).
The presence of colorant impurities are consistent with the XRD HDPE-C
(Figure 4b).

and (h) oxygen in the HDPE-C carbon material.

Amorphous/turbostratic nature of LDPE-C and HDPE-C was analyzed
by Raman spectroscopy and XRD patterns. Figure 3a,b depicts the Raman spectra of LDPE and
HDPE and its derivative materials. LDPE bags show Raman bands (red
curve) at 1067, 1132, 1299, 1441, 1455, and 1465 cm–1 corresponding to different behaviors, such as bending, twisting,
and stretching of CH2. HDPE shows different Raman bands
(red) because of additional components/impurities such as pigments
of different colors. A strong peak at 1580 cm–1 (blue)
of LDPE-S and HDPE-S is indicative of the cross-linking and aromatization
during the solvothermal synthesis.18 LDPE-C
and HDPE-C confirm the disordered carbon nature (yellow curves) from
PE plastic bags, showing peaks at 1350 and 1580 cm–1 that relate to the D and G bands.18 Raman
spectroscopy studies confirm the transformation of plastic bags into
carbonaceous materials during solvothermal processing followed by
pyrolysis.

(LDPE-S) and carbonization (LDPE-C) process and (b) as-received HDPE
after the solvothermal synthesis (HDPE-S) and carbonization (HDPE-C)
process.

The XRD pattern depicted peaks
corresponding to (002) and (001)
Miller turbostratic or amorphous planes of carbon in LDPE-C (Figure 4a) and HDPE-C (Figure 4b). These broad diffraction peaks indicate the amorphous carbon
structure.19 However, HDPE-C shows strong
peaks corresponding to (220), (400), (422), (440), and (620) Miller
planes. These diffraction peaks are analogous to the MgAl2O4 crystal structure. It is known that HDPE could have
pigments/colorants that contains MgO and alumina. With the thermal
treatment, these impurities in the raw material are converted into
the MgAl2O4 structure. So, the derived carbon
materials of HDPE-C contain around 10% MgAl2O4. These colorant impurities are observed in SEM–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (Figure 2c–h) as well as TGA measurements (Figure 6).

Figure 4 XRD patterns of carbon
chips derived from plastic feedstock: LDPE-C
(a) and HDPE-C (b).

Additional detailed characterization
of carbon chips was performed
through N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of LDPE-C
(Figure 5a) and HDPE-C
(Figure 5b). These
curves reveal the behavior of H3 isotherm (IUPAC classification)
for both the samples;20 HDPE-C compared
with LDPE-C shows a high hysteresis suggesting the existence of macropores.21 SEM images in HDPE-C show macropores, possibly
generated because of the thermochemical reaction of colorant impurities
with HDPE during pyrolysis treatment. The decrease in the surface
area is also a result of the contaminant present in HDPE, as shown
in Table 1. Density
functional theory (DFT) pore size distribution is shown for LDPE-C
(Figure 5c) and HDPE (Figure 5d). In addition to the pores at around 1.5 nm, in HDPE-C,
4 nm pores are also observed possibly due to the contribution from
the inorganic contaminants.

and (b) HDPE-C. The DFT pore size distribution and pore volume for

TGA of feedstock LDPE
plastics (red) and solvothermally treated
plastics (black) were performed under an argon atmosphere to determine
the remaining mass yields. Figure 6a demonstrates that LDPE starts
degrading above 400 °C and completely becomes gaseous phase,
with no solid mass remaining above 500 °C. This confirms that
the thermal decomposition of LDPE in an inert atmosphere does not
lead to fabricated carbon-based materials. Alternatively, the sulfonated
PE starts showing mass loss from the beginning until it reaches 600
°C. This is a result of conversion of cross-linked PE to a carbon-based
material. Around 50% yield remains after the TGA characterization
of LDPE. Figure 6b
presents the TGA of feedstock-trashed HDPE (red) and solvothermally
sulfonated HDPE (black). Analogous to LDPE, the thermal decomposition
of HDPE is observed till 500 °C. However, between 500 and 700
°C, additional kink is measured because of inorganic colorant/pigment
transformation. Remaining 10 wt % content is the pigments that were
detected as MgAl2O4 in the presented XRD pattern
(Figure 4b). However,
sulfonated HDPE has analogous behavior to LDPE with additional kink
between 100 and 200 °C, as a result of sulfur melting and/or
its interactions with inorganic pigments. Continuous loss of sulfur
due to its weak bonding with polymers and analogous behavior has been
reported in sulfur/CNT22 and carbon compartment/sulfur23 materials.

Figure 6 TGA of LDPE and LDPE-S (a) and HDPE and
HDPE-S (b).

To investigate the electrochemical
characteristics, the cyclic
voltammetric analysis was carried out for the assembled lithium cells
comprising LDPE-C and HDPE-C carbon materials between 0.005 and 2.0
V versus Li+/Li at the scan rate of 0.2 mV s–1 for three cycles, as shown in Figure 7a (LDPE-C) and Figure 7b (HDPE-C). In the first cycle of cyclic voltammograms,
significant irreversible redox processes appear, which are associated
with the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation on the carbon
surface,24,25 intercalation–deintercalation process,
and followed by the capacitive ionization/deionization26,27 and adsorption/desorption28,29 processes in line with
the electromotive force. The obtained strong reduction peak is at
0.8 V related to SEI formation24,25 during the first lithiation
on the carbon surface of LDPE-C and HDPE-C carbon materials. Obviously,
it can be seen that the Li+ ion storage occurs by the capacitive
ionization/deionization26,27 and adsorption/desorption28,29 processes on the carbon surface that leads to the cyclic voltammograms
with a wide hysteresis.24,25 In addition to this
phenomena, the Li-ion intercalation–deintercalation process
takes place during cycling in the short-range order amorphous carbon.30

Figure 7 Cyclic voltammetric analysis of fabricated lithium cells
using
(a) LDPE-C and (b) HDPE-C carbon materials between 0.005 and 2.0 V
vs Li+/Li at 0.2 mV s–1 for the first
three cycles.

Figure 8a,b shows
the first and second discharge (lithiation) and charge (delithiation)
curves for LDPE-C and HDPE-C samples, respectively. First cycle capacity
losses of 40 and 43% (25 and 50 °C, respectively) for the LDPE-C
sample with higher lithiation/delithiation potential is evident. Analogous
43 and 45% (25 and 50 °C, respectively) capacity losses in HDPE-C
are also noticed, reflecting significant SEIformation. This loss is
associated with electrolyte breakdown, forming SEI on larger surface
area carbon chips with irreversible adsorption of Li at surface defects
and surface-attached O or S atoms.31 The
decrease in the charge–discharge potentials during the second
cycle is an outcome of stable SEI formation and its stabilization
on later cycles.32 The recorded specific
capacities are slightly enhanced than the theoretical (372 mA h/g)
capacity of graphite in the LDPE-derived carbon sample. HDPE-derived
carbon yields improved capacities compared to LDPE-derived carbons
because of additional inorganic impurities which participated in the
electrochemical redox or alloying reactions.33

Figure 8 Room
(25 °C) and elevated temperature (50 °C) voltage
profiles of (a) LDPE-derived C and (b) HDPE-derived C obtained at
C/10 rate (1 C = 372 mA/g current density). Room-temperature voltage
profiles using various current densities for LDPE-C (c) and HDPE-C
(d) samples.

The room-temperature
voltage profiles for LDPE-C and HDPE-C electrodes
cycled at various currents are shown in Figure 8c,d, respectively. Both LDPE-C and HDPE-C
showed similar behavior in the first two cycles. Even at 1 C high
current density, the charge and discharge capacities are greater than
200 mA h/g because of the shorter diffusion distance in carbon chips.
For standard graphitic materials, typically, the anode particle size
is 10–20 μm requiring additional time for charging or
discharging.30

Figure 9 summarizes
the galvanostatic cycling results of LDPE-C and HDPE-C anodes. Figure 9a,b shows the rate
studies performed utilizing various current densities, yielding reversible
capacities of 230 and 290 mA h/g (25 and 50 °C, respectively,
for LDPE-C). A slight increase in capacity to 350 and 440 mA h/g (25
and 50 °C, respectively for HDPE-C) is recorded at C/5 rate.
At 1 C rate (i.e., 1 h charging and 1 h discharging), the capacity
drops to 160 and 210 mA h/g (25 and 50 °C, respectively) for
LDPE-C and 240 and 270 mA h/g (25 and 50 °C, respectively) for
HDPE-C. Long cycle stability of the carbon sample was studied through
a cycling rate of C/5 (Figure 9c). After initial 20 cycles, a stable reversible capacity
of 200 mA h/g is achieved for both LDPE-C (red) and HDPE-C (black).

HDPE-C (b) at 25 and 50 °C, respectively. (c) Long-term cycling

Conclusions
The described novel
solvothermal upcycling approach totally gets
rid of low- and high-density waste plastic bags by converting them
into functional carbonaceous materials. The presented solvothermal
upcycling approach generates high pressure at a low temperature, improving
PE sulfonation reproducibly with a high carbon yield and forming mesmerizing
carbon chips. Raman spectroscopy and XRD verified the turbostratic/amorphous
carbon structure for both LDPE-C and HDPE-C. However, XRD identified
MgAl2O4 impurities in HDPE-C, aroused from the
pigment-derived impurities. Solvothermal upcycling process obtained
a moderate Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area
of 752.3 and 673.5 m2/g for LDPE-C, and HDPE-C, respectively.
TGA analysis of low- and high-density plastics and their sulfonated
derivatives provided the scientific reaction mechanism with the understanding
of the cross-linking phenomena. Li-ion batteries prepared from upcycled
LDPE-C and HDPE-C anode materials demonstrated their fascinating function
in Li-ion storage at elevated and room temperatures.
