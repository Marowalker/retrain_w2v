Layered two-dimensional
transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) alloys
with strong intralayer ionic-covalent bonds and weak interlayer van
der Waals bonds have been extensively studied in recent years owing
to their tunable electronic and optoelectronic properties. However,
the relationship among atomic bond identities, band offset, and related
semiconductor-to-metal transition in ternary alloys of TMDs with different
thicknesses under hydrostatic pressure at the atomic level remains
largely unexplored, despite the fact that it plays an important role
in the functionality of TMD-based devices. In this work, we investigate
the thickness-dependent band offset and semiconductor-to-metal transition
in Mo(1–x)WxS2 with different thicknesses under hydrostatic
pressure based on the atomic-bond-relaxation correlation mechanism.
It was found that the compression ratio in the out-of-plane direction
is significantly higher than that of in-plane, and the band shift
and semiconductor-to-metal transition are significantly modulated
by the hydrostatic pressure, number of layers, and composition. The
theoretical predictions are consistent with the experimental observations
and calculations, suggesting that our approach can be suitable for
other layered TMDs.

1 Introduction
Two-dimensional transition-metal
dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) have
been heavily studied owing to their diverse applications in nanoelectronics,
optoelectronic devices, as well as energy harvesting and so on.1−5 These materials belong to layered structures, and the band structures
vary from semiconducting to semimetallic with combinations of elemental
composition.6 Among them, the sulfide TMDs
(MS2) (M = Mo, W) are used in the wide-ranging fabrications
of optoelectronic nanodevices, high responsive photodetectors, and
transistors because of their large bandgap of 1–2 eV, high
on/off ratio (∼108), and room-temperature mobility
of >200 cm2 V–1 s–1.1−3,7−10 Furthermore, to integrate MS2 for advanced applications, many possibilities have been employed
to extend the related material properties by external means, such
as strain,11 doping,12 and external fields.13

Recently, alloying semiconductors provide an avenue to achieve
continuously tunable band structure, carrier mobility, and effective
mass, as reported by both theory and experiment for Mo(1–x)WxS2,12,14,15 and the negative values of mixing
enthalpy mean that Mo(1–x)WxS2 has good thermodynamic stability
at room temperature.16−18 However, these methods are finite and irreversible
for the band structures and band offsets. In particular, external
pressure can also be used as an effective method to modulate the relevant
physical and chemical properties of 2D materials, and some achievements
have been obtained, for example, MoS2 and WS2 monolayer, bilayer, and the corresponding bulk counterparts can
undergo a semiconductor-to-metal transition under the condition of
pressure.19−34 Under the condition of hydrostatic pressure, the compressive rate
in the direction of out-of-plane was significantly higher than that
of in-plane because of their unique layered structures due to the
strong intralayer ionic-covalent bonds and the weak interlayer van
der Waals (vdW) interactions.19−22,24,26,27 On the other hand, the electronic
properties have also been changed under hydrostatic pressure.21,22,24,27,31−34 Especially, the bandgap of bulk
TMDs was found to be reduced consequently and to become metallic with
increasing pressure, whereas the bandgap of the monolayer gradually
increased in the small pressure range.21,22,31,32 Importantly, the evolution
of band structure combined modulation of composition and number of
layers under hydrostatic pressure has gained an increased interest.
However, for the aspect of theoretical method at the atomic level,
the role of hydrostatic pressure on the band evolution in Mo(1–x)WxS2 is still
lacking. Therefore, it is necessary to address the related underlying
mechanism in TMD alloys, including (i) the variation of bond identities
involved in bond length, bond energy, and bond angle with the composition
and pressure, (ii) the relationship between number of layers and bandgap
under pressure, and (iii) the origin of pressure-dependent semiconductor-to-metal
transitions under different composition and number of layers.

2 Principle
Structurally, layered material, Mo(1–x)WxS2, consists
of intralayer
ionic-covalent bonds and is stacked with interlayer vdW interaction
. Notably, each layer contains a single layer of metal atoms and two
planes of dichalcogenide atoms and thus forms a sandwiched structure,
which are coordinated through ionic-covalent interactions. The intralayer
bonding of M–S in each S–M–S trilayer is strong,
and the weak vdW force exists at the interlayer. For the case of a
Mo(1–x)WxS2 with number of layers n, the
total energy can be expressed as 1  where Uintra and Uinter are the M–S potential of intralayer
and interlayer interactions, respectively, Udis is the distortion energy originally from the lattice mismatch
of MoS2 and WS2. Conventionally, the potential
function of Born–Mayer–Huggins-type was employed to
consider the ionic, covalent, and weak vdW interactions among atoms,
and which has been successfully applied to various ionic solid materials35,36 2  

The first term represents the Coulomb potential
(Z is the atomic charge on atom i or j, and e is the elementary
electric charge, rij is
the interactions distance),
and the second and third terms correspond to the short-rang exchange
repulsion potential and the dipole–dipole vdW dispersive interactions
(Aij, σij, and ρij are
the constants for each atom pair, and Cij is the constant for each atom), respectively. The
fourth and fifth, respectively, correspond to the More-type and angle
potentials (Dij, kϕ, and αij are the bond potential parameters, ϕ is the bending
angle, r0 and ϕ0 are
the distance and angle of atoms at minimum energy, respectively),
which are the covalent interactions. The interaction potentials of
intralayer are employed by More-type, angle, and Coulomb potentials.37,38 The atomic interaction of interlayer corresponds to the Coulomb,
short-rang exchange repulsion, and vdW potential.36

In the case of intralayer M–S bond (using dij to describe the M–S
bond length),
the interaction potential between M and S consists of bond stretching, Ubond, bond angle variation, Uangle, and Coulomb electrostatic potential, Ucoul.37,38 Thus, we have 3  Here, Ubond = D ×
[1 – e–α(dij–d0)]2, , and , where kθ and kψ are the bond potential
parameters. It is found that the force constant is almost the same
for MoS2 and WS2, and thus, the parameters should
be approximately equal. In our case, we take D =
19.945, α = 0.858, kθ = 0.9387,
and kψ = 0.8631 as the representative
values in our calculations,39,40d0 is the bond length, θ and ψ are the S–M–S
bond angles in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, respectively. Zi and Zj are the partial electrostatic of M and S.
In the case of Mo(1–x)WxS2, the composition-dependent partial
electrostatic charge is , whereas the values are
0.76 and −0.38
for Mo and S atoms and 0.84 and −0.42 for W and S atoms, respectively.39,41 In addition, the lattice parameters of the alloy follow the Vegrad’s
law,42a0(x) = (1 – x)·aA + x·aB, c0(x) = (1 – x)·cA + x·cB, and , where x is the composition, aA and aB are the
distances of S–S along x-direction for MoS2 and WS2, cA, and cB are the distances of S–S along the z-direction for MoS2 and WS2, respectively.
The M–S bond length, , and
the band angle,  and .38

Notably, for the case of Mo(1–x)WxS2, the
total bond length
is unchanged as the lattice parameter follows the Vegrad’s
law,42 such that ∑Δdij = 0, whereas , where ΔdW–S and ΔdMo–S are the variations
of W–S and Mo–S bond lengths.43−45 However, the
variation of bond length in the alloys would lead to the distortion
energy. Moreover, the distortion energy can be related with the composition
in the intralayer, that is, Udis = Ω·x(1 – x), where Ω is the constant.44−46 In addition, the interlayer interaction in Mo(1–x)WxS2 contains
the Coulomb electrostatic energy, Ucoul, short-range exchange repulsive potential, Urep, and dipole–dipole vdW dispersive interactions, UvdW (t denotes the interlayer
distance of S–S). Also, the vdW interaction between M–M
and M–S can be negligible because the coupling of interlayer
from M–M and S–M is far weaker than that of S–S,
thus, the electronic coupling of two adjacent layers is mainly determined
by the interlayer interaction of S–S.47 Thus, the interlayer energy of each S atom is36,48 4  Here, , , and , where i and j are the S atoms of adjacent layers. The constants of S–S
include Aij = 0.00714
eV, σij = 0.17 Å, ρij = 3.66 Å, and C =
49.19 eVÅ6.48 Therefore,
the variation of energy in the intralayer and interlayer under the
approach of pressure is ΔUintra and
ΔUinter, respectively. Combining
the interactions from intralayer and interlayer, the variation of
average single bond energy in the system induced by hydrostatic pressure
can be obtained as 5  where N is the number of
atoms, and zn is the
layer number dependence of coordination number (CN). Notably, the
effective CN of monolayer, bilayer, and bulk MS2 are 4,
6, and 12, respectively.49

Physically,
the cohesive energy is EC = znEn, where EC and En are the cohesive
energy and single bond energy, respectively. Subsequently, the cohesive
energy of the system under hydrostatic pressure is 6  where EnA and EnB are the layer number dependence
of single
bond energy in MoS2 and WS2, respectively. According
to the atomic-bond-relaxation (ABR) correlation mechanism,50−52 a nanosystem can be approached as a core/shell configuration. Considering
the discrepancy of bond order between the core interior and the surface
shell, the intra-atomic potential well depression from Eb to En = cn–mEb, where cn = 2/(1 + exp((12 – zn)/8zn)) is the bond contraction coefficient, Eb denotes the single bond energy of the bulk counterpart, and
the index m = 2.7 is the bond nature factor.50−52 Moreover, in terms of the band theory,50 the Hamiltonian for the Mo(1–x)WxS2 under hydrostatic pressure
can be shown in the form: Ĥ = Ĥ0 + Ĥ′ = −ℏΔ2/2M + Vatom(r) + Vcry(r + RC), where M is the
atomic mass, Vatom(r)
is the intra-atomic trapping potential and Ĥ′ = Vcry(r + RC) is the periodic potential of the crystal,
that is, the interaction binding potential or crystal potential, RC is the lattice constant. Also, the bandgap
width is proportional to the first Fourier coefficient of the system.53 Thus, the bandgap is proportional to the single
bond energy that can be written as mean cohesive energy per bond,
⟨E0⟩, that is, Eg = 2|V1| ∝ ⟨E0⟩, where V1 = ∫Vcry(r)eik·r. Consequently,
combining with the relationship shown above, the composition, pressure,
and layer number dependence of bandgap in Mo(1–x)WxS2 under
hydrostatic pressure is 7  where EbA and EbB are the average
single bond energy of bulk MoS2 and WS2, respectively,
and Eg,bA is the bandgap of the bulk MoS2 counterpart.

3 Results and Discussion
In general, TMDs belong to the
space group P63/mmc,
and consist of a hexagonal plane of
M atoms sandwiched by two hexagonal planes of S atoms. Along the z-direction, the AB stacking is preferred in the bulk, multilayer,
and bilayer because of the most stable state. Interestingly, the lattice
parameters are almost the same for MoS2 and WS2, resulting in the stacking configuration that does not change the
alloys of Mo(1–x)WxS2.54Figure 1 shows the crystalline
structure of Mo1–xWxS2. Note that the structure of Mo1–xWxS2 responds to the hydrostatic pressure in an anisotropic way
because of the anisotropic modulus of elasticity.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of
M(1–x)WxS2. θ is the in-plane S–M–S
angle, ψ is the out-of-plane S–M–S angle, t is the distance of adjacent layer. The related parameters
are listed as: aA = 3.160 Å, cA = 3.16 Å, aB = 3.155 Å, cB = 3.16 Å, and t0 = 3.13 Å.54

In the light of the relationship
mentioned above, we calculate
the pressure-dependent bond parameters of Mo(1–x)WxS2, as
shown in Figure 2.
Clearly, in Figure 2a,c, the lattice parameter, a, and the bond length, d, decrease slightly with increasing pressure. Moreover,
the lattice parameter and M–S bond length of MoS2 (WS2) reveal a linear decrease under hydrostatic pressure
with a rate of 0.0107 and 0.004 Å/GPa (0.0096 and 0.0023 Å/GPa),
respectively. It is also found that the thickness of intralayer defined
by S–S distance increases slightly under pressure due to the
Poisson effect (see Figure 2b). In addition, the change of intralayer bond parameters
results in the increase of in-plane angle, θ, whereas decrease
of out-of-plane angle, ψ under pressure (see Figure 2d,e). Notably, the interlayer t decreases strongly under pressure, reflecting the weak
vdW interaction of interlayer, and shrinks abruptly with pressure
especially below 20 GPa (see Figure 2f). Obviously, our predictions are consistent with
the first-principles calculations.26,27

(d), and interlayer t (f) in M(1–x)WxS2.

Moreover, the composition-dependent
elastic modulus of Mo(1–x)WxS2 in the
intralayer can be expressed as: , where Yl is the elastic modulus of MS2. The intralayer elastic
moduli of MoS2 in x-, y-,and z-directions are 200.3, 197.8, and 511 GPa,
whereas those x- and y-directions
of WS2 are 218 and 211 GPa, respectively.55,56 Also, we can get the elastic modulus in the z-direction
through the relationship: Yx-(MoS2)/Yx-(WS2) = Yz-(MoS2)/Yz-(WS2), then that in the z-direction of WS2 is equal to 545 GPa. Ghorbani-Asl et
al.56 indicated that the stress–strain
relation curves of monolayer MS2 satisfy the Hooke’s
law, and the uniaxial tensile strain can reach up to 19%. Furthermore,
the elastic modulus in the interlayer can be obtained by taking the
second derivative of the interlayer interaction, that is, ,57 where Γ
is the number of atoms in a unit area, and in our calculation, we
take Γ = 11/nm2. Therefore, we have the change of
bond parameters under hydrostatic pressure 8  where v∥ and v⊥ are the Poisson’s
ratio in the in-plane and out-of-plane of intralayer. Note that the v∥ = 0.21 and v⊥ = 0.27 for the Mo(1–x)WxS2.55,58,59

Figure 3 shows
the
change of unit cell volume in Mo(1–x)WxS2 at the composition of x = 0, 0.5, and 1 as a function of pressure with the bulk,
bilayer, and monolayer, respectively. In general, the relationship
between volume and pressure is described by the third-order Birch–Murnaghan
equation:60,61, where B and B′ are the bulk modulus and its first-order
pressure derivative,
ξ = V/V0 is the
ratio of volume addressed after and before being compressed, and V0 represents the volume under ambient pressure, V is the pressure-dependent unit cell volume, and V = a(x)b(x)[nc(x) + (n – 1)t]. Notably, the composition-dependent
bulk modulus can be described by:62B(x) = [(1 – x)·aABA + x·aBBB]/a0(x). Evidently,
in Figure 3, we see
that the change of volume is large due to weak interlayer interaction.19−21,23,24 Also, we obtain the bulk modulus of MoS2 (WS2), which is 57.92 ± 0.98 GPa (59.68 ± 2.47 GPa) with its
first pressure derivation, B′ = 3.59 ±
0.06 GPa (3.69 ± 0.15 GPa). Our results agree with the related
experimental measurements and theoretical calculations.19,20,24 Nayak et al.21 and Chi et al.24 reported that the bulk moduli of bulk MoS2 are 57 GPa and 57.86 ± 0.30 GPa with B′ being 4.6 and 5.28 ± 0.01 GPa, respectively. Selvi
et al.20 revealed that the bulk modulus
of bulk WS2 is B = 61 ± 1 GPa with B′ = 9.0 ± 0.3 GPa. A similar method is used
with Mo(1–x)WxS2 with the monolayer and bilayer, and the results
are shown in Figure 3d. Moreover, the corresponding values are listed in Table 1. Importantly, the bulk modulus
of monolayer Mo(1–x)WxS2 is larger than that of the bilayer
and bulk counterparts because the monolayer has only strong covalent
bonds and lacks weak vdW bonds. Also, the bulk modulus of Mo(1–x)WxS2 has
an approximately linear increase with increasing composition due to
similar lattice parameters of MoS2 and WS2.

equation.

Figure 4 shows the
various kinds of energy change in M(1–x)WxS2 with different
layers under the condition of hydrostatic pressure. Especially, the
distortion energy in M(1–x)WxS2 expresses a dramatic increase
and then decrease with increasing x, and it can be
attributed to the bond mismatch of MoS2 and WS2. Notably, the red points in the figure are the results of our calculations
when the composition equals to 0, 1/3, 2/3, and 1, respectively. Therefore,
the composition-dependent distortion energy of Mo1–xWxS2 for each
atom can be obtained. Also, we get the interaction parameter of Ω
= 1.027 eV (see Figure 4a). In addition, Figure 4b–d show the pressure-dependent energy change of single
M–S bond in M(1–x)WxS2, including bond stretching,
bond angle variation, and electrostatic interaction with the composition
at x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, respectively. Obviously,
the energy from bond stretching and bond angle relaxation is monotonically
decreasing, and the electrostatic interaction increases approximately
linearly with increasing pressure. Figure 4e depicts that the interlayer interaction
of an S atom decreases approximately linearly with increasing pressure
in terms of eq 4. According
to the ABR consideration,50−52 external perturbation such as
doping and pressure can lead to the system relaxing spontaneously
to a new self-equilibrium state. Therefore, some physical quantities
such as cohesive energy will be different from that of the bulk counterparts.

interactions of an S atom, and (f) change of average single bond energy
for the monolayer, bilayer, and bulk M(1–x)WxS2 as a function
of pressure, respectively.

Theoretically, the cohesive energy is defined as: EC = znEn, and the cohesive
energies
of monolayer MoS2 and WS2 are 1.35 and 2.15
eV, respectively.49 For the case of Mo(1–x)WxS2, the average single bond energy can be expressed as
the function of composition, number of layers, and hydrostatic pressure,
that is, Eb(x,p,n) = (1 – x)EnA + xEnB + ΔE. In Figure 4f, we can see that the single bond energy in the bulk Mo(1–x)WxS2 immediately
decreases with applied pressure due to the strong interlayer interactions.
Whereas in the case of bilayer and monolayer, the single bond energy
in a small pressure range increases initially. Interestingly, it will
intersect with the composition at 0 < x < 0.46
due to the existence of distortion energy.

Furthermore, Figure 5 depicts the bandgap
of MoS2, Mo0.5W0.5S2,
and WS2 as a function of pressure under
the condition of monolayer, bilayer, and bulk, respectively. Evidently,
the bandgaps of MoS2, Mo0.5W0.5S2, and WS2 in bulk counterparts decrease with increasing
pressure. For the cases of bilayer and monolayer, the bandgaps increase
first, and then gradually decrease with increasing pressure. In detail,
in Figure 5a, we can
see that the extreme points at 19.2, 21.1, and 24.3 GPa correspond
to the bandgaps of 2.08, 2.21, and 2.47 eV for the monolayer MoS2, Mo0.5W0.5S2, and WS2, and the metallization at pressures of 68.8, 76.2, and 81.5
GPa, whereas the extreme points for the bilayer at 4.3, 6.9, and 10.8
GPa indicate the bandgaps of 1.58, 1.61, and 1.89 eV. Also, the metallization
for the bilayer is at pressures of 38.4, 41.5, and 43.7 GPa, respectively.
Furthermore, the metallization of bulk MoS2, Mo0.5W0.5S2, and WS2 at pressures of
23, 27, and 30 GPa, respectively. Interestingly, there will be the
intersection between the bandgaps with the composition x < 0.46 by the range of pressure less than 5 GPa. Importantly,
the pressure of extreme point and metallization increase with increasing
W composition, whereas the extreme point vanishes with increasing
number of layers owing to the strong interaction between the interlayer.
This result can be a good response to the variation of Mo(1–x)WxS2 over
the entire pressure range. Similarly, Nayak et al.31 and Kim et al.34 found that
the bandgaps of bulk MoS2, Mo0.5W0.5S2, as well as WS2 decrease continuously, whereas
those of the monolayer and bilayer increase initially and then monotonously
decrease to zero at which the metallization occurs with increasing
pressure in terms of experimental measurements and ab initio calculations.
Interestingly, higher W composition in monolayer Mo(1–x)WxS2 contributes
to a greater pressure-sensitivity of direct bandgap opening. In addition, Figure 5b shows the bandgap
of monolayer Mo(1–x)WxS2 as a function of pressure in the small
pressure range. Obviously, a near-linear enhancement of the bandgap
is shown below 6 GPa, whereas its increment slows down above 6 GPa.
Importantly, our predictions are consistent with the previous works.31−34 In fact, the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band
maximum (VBM) are dominated by d orbitals of metal elements and the
p orbitals of S atoms.31,34 For the case of monolayer Mo1–xWxS2, the orbitals move away the Fermi level at lower pressure,
resulting in the bandgap increasing as the pressure enhances, whereas
the rising rate increases with increasing W composition. At higher
pressure, the orbitals interact strongly between M d and S p, resulting
in the decrease of bandgap and finally there is an overlap of VBM
and CBM. Importantly, there has been a direct-to-indirect transition,
while the intralayer interaction of in-plane plays a dominant role
for the process of metallization.31,34 Similarity,
the trend of bandgap in bilayer Mo1–xWxS2 is consistent with
the change of monolayer under pressure, but the magnitude of the change
is somewhat different because of the limitation of interactions between
layers. In the case of bulk Mo1–xWxS2, the VBM and CBM are
close to the Fermi level with applied pressure because of the limit
of sulfur–sulfur interactions, resulting in the decrease of
bandgap and finally metallization. Moreover, the metallization pressure
increases when the W composition enhances.

values in a small pressure range for monolayer M(1–x)WxS2.

Based on the discussion mentioned
above, we further explored the
pressure, composition, and layer number dependence of semiconductor-to-metal
transition in Mo(1–x)WxS2, as shown in the Figure 6. In detail, the solid line represents the
transition point. Clearly, it can be concluded that the transition
from semiconductor-to-metal is more easy with increasing number of
layers. When the layer number is fixed, the transition pressure increases
with increasing W composition. Similarly, Nayak et al.31 indicated that as the number of layers increase,
the transition pressure of semiconductor-to-metal in MoS2 decreases. Kim et al.34 also showed that
the transition pressure of semiconductor-to-metal increase with increasing
number of layers, whereas lower W composition results in a delayed
semiconductor-to-metal transition in Mo(1–x)WxS2. Importantly,
the physical origin of transition for the monolayer Mo(1–x)WxS2 can
be attributed to the change of M–S bond length under pressure
because of the absence of interlayer interactions. For the bilayer
and bulk alloys of Mo(1–x)WxS2, the compression of interlayer
becomes more favorable than that of intralayer, indicating that the
interlayer coupling of S–S increases at the pressure, resulting
in the transition of semiconductor-to-metal, and the metallization
under pressure is mainly determined by the coupling of layers.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
we propose a quantitative approach to investigate the
relaxation of bond identities, band offset, and semiconductor-to-metal
transition in Mo1–xWxS2 with different number of layers under
hydrostatic pressure in terms of ABR correlation mechanism. It was
found that the bulk modulus of monolayer Mo(1–x)WxS2 is significantly
larger than that of its bilayer and bulk counterparts due to the lack
of interlayer interaction, and the bulk modulus of bilayer is slightly
larger than that of bulk because the bulk modulus is mainly controlled
by interlayer interactions, whereas the bulk modulus increases slightly
with increasing composition. In nature, the variations of bond identities
change the total energy of the entire system. Thus, the bandgaps of
monolayer and bilayer show a blue-shift and then red-shift with increasing
pressure, whereas the bandgap of bulk Mo1–xWxS2 displays a red-shift
with increasing pressure owing to the strong coupling of interlayer.
Moreover, the transition of semiconductor-to-metal decreases with
increasing layer number in the Mo1–xWxS2 under pressure approach.
Also, the transition pressure increases with increasing W composition
when the layer number is fixed. Our predictions are in good agreement
with the available experimental observations and calculations, suggesting
that the method can be suitable for the layered materials for the
desired applications.
