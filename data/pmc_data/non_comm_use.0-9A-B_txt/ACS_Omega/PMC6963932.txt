One-pot synthesis has been developed for 4-carboethoxybenzo[h]coumarins starting from α-/β-naphthols. Accordingly,
diverse 4-carboethoxybenzocoumarins can be synthesized in moderate-to-excellent
(31–75%) isolated yields. The synthesis involves
initial oxidation of naphthols to the intermediary 1,2-naphthoquinones
with 2-iodoxybenzoic acid followed by a cascade of reactions, namely,
Wittig olefination, Michael addition, β-elimination, and cyclization.
Furthermore, we have comprehensively investigated the excited-state
properties of differently substituted 4-carboalkoxybenzo[h]coumarins. It is shown that they exhibit low to high fluorescence
quantum yields (1–36%) and excited-state lifetimes (ca. 1–7
ns) depending on the substitution pattern and solvent employed.

Introduction
Coumarins, 2H-benzopyran-2-ones,
are an important family of heterocyclic aromatic compounds with their
benzopyranone core scaffold present in a wide range of natural products.1 In general, benzopyranones are well known for
diverse biological activities such as anti-inflammatory,2 antifungal,3 anticlotting,4 antioxidant,5 anticancer,6 acetylcholinesterase inhibition,7 etc. Despite their structural simplicity, they have garnered
much importance because of their unique photophysical properties such
as high-fluorescence quantum yields, large Stokes shifts, and respectable
photostability. Indeed, they continue to be exploited in functional
materials, for example, laser dyes,8 organic
light-emitting diodes,9 nonlinear optical
materials,10 and so forth and in phenomena
such as sensing.11 Although coumarins are
excellent fluorescent probes, their low-lying absorption and emission
wavelengths (high energy) limit their applications somewhat. Consequently,
there is a continuing interest in exploring the properties of π-conjugated
coumarins and benzo-fused coumarins. Insofar, as the latter is concerned,
four structurally different categories are known depending on the
way in which the ring is annulated in each case, cf. Figure 1. Benzo[g]coumarins
are the most studied systems because of linear benzo-fusion, which
results in a large shift in the absorption maximum because of linear
π-conjugation.12

Figure 1 Different benzocoumarins (BCs) derived from benzoannulation of coumarin.

Although benzo[c]coumarins with
cross-conjugated feature have been found to be almost nonemissive,
they too have been good synthetic targets and are found to exhibit
moderate fluorescence quantum yields depending on the nature of the
substituent(s).13a,13b They are also found to constitute
a number of natural products that exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial
activities.13c Similar to benzo[g]coumarins, benzo[h/f]coumarins also exhibit rich photophysical properties, Figure 2. It has been found that for
similar donor and acceptor substituents, benzo[g]coumarins
and benzo[f]coumarins show mostly red-shifted and
blue-shifted absorption maxima, respectively, while benzo[h]coumarins show a borderline behavior.14 Indeed, the latter compounds, that is, benzo[h]coumarins, are the ones that are most often employed as two-photon
fluorescent probes; their higher bioavailability makes them promising
candidates for various cellular imaging applications.15 Thus, a rich chemistry with simple skeletal features makes
coumarins attractive targets to synthetic chemists. The conventional
synthesis of coumarins is by the Pechmann condensation.16 Although a number of improved methods are now
known, the use of conc. H2SO4 at high temperatures
limits the applicability of Pechmann condensation when certain sensitive
functional groups are present. A number of name reactions such as
Perkin, Reformatsky, Wittig, Knoevenagel, Kostanecki, and so forth
have been employed for diversity-oriented synthesis of coumarins.17 In recent times, synthesis of various coumarins
by C–H bond activation using transition metal-based catalysts
such as Pd(OAc)2, Rh2(OAc)4, and
so forth have also been reported.18 The
latter protocols, unfortunately, are associated with experimental
conditions involving high temperature, requirement of inert atmosphere,
tedious workup, and so forth.

probes15 (3–8) containing
the benzo[h]coumarin scaffold.

We have, for quite some time, been concerned with
oxidations mediated by 2-iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX)19 and Oxone.20 We recently showed
that α-/β-naphthols that are readily oxidized to 1,2-quinones
can be set up for a number of consecutive/tandem reactions in the
same pot, leading to 4-arylthio-1,2-naphthoquinones, 4-arylthio-1,2-diacetoxynaphthalenes,
5-arylthio-/5-aminobenzo[a]phenazines,21a and carbazolophenazines.21b In continuation of these investigations, we sought to explore
one-pot annulations to access benzo[h]coumarins via
initial Wittig olefination of 1,2-quinones generated from phenols
by IBX—followed by intramolecular cyclization and subsequent
base-mediated elimination; it should be noted that IBX, a hypervalent
iodine(V) reagent, has emerged as an indispensable innocuous organic
oxidation reagent in recent years for a variety of organic transformations
that include conversion of alcohols to carbonyls,22 dehydrogenation of aliphatic ketones to α,β-unsaturated
ketones,23a benzylic compounds to aryl carbonyls,23b thioamides to 1,2,4-thiadiazoles,23c and
so forth. Herein, we report facile one-pot synthesis of diverse benzo[h]coumarins in excellent isolated yields starting from β-naphthols.
It is shown from a comprehensive investigation of the photophysical
properties that differently substituted benzo[h]coumarins
exhibit respectable fluorescence quantum yields and large Stokes shifts.

Results and Discussions
One-Pot Synthesis of Benzo[h]coumarins
The oxidation of phenols and naphthols by IBX to 1,2-quinones is
a well-known reaction.24 The chemistry
of 1,2-quinones has been immensely investigated in the literature.25 In particular, a number of reactions have been
documented for 1,2-naphthoquinones derived from α- and β-naphthols.
The reaction of 1,2-quinone with triphenylcarbethoxymethylene-phosphorane
ylide to afford 4-carboethoxycoumarin was investigated in much detail
by Tarantili and co-workers.26 However,
the substrate scope was virtually not explored. As mentioned earlier,
we wished to develop, in continuation of our IBX-mediated investigations,
one-pot syntheses of BCs using IBX-mediated oxidation
of α- and β-naphthols to intermediary 1,2-quinones as
the key reaction and by subjecting the latter to Wittig olefination
in a consecutive fashion as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 One-Pot Synthesis of Benzocoumarins
To begin with, the one-pot synthesis was investigated
at room temperature in a variety of solvents by employing β-naphthol
as a representative substrate. Accordingly, oxidation of α-
or β-naphthol was initially performed with IBX (1.2 equiv) in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and the resultant 1,2-quinone was subjected
to Wittig olefination with the ylide (2.4 equiv) by introducing different
solvents. At this time, NaHCO3 was also introduced as a
base to facilitate cyclization, vide infra. As can be seen in Table 1, the yield of BC could be improved from 30 to 70% when the duration of the
reaction and amount of the base were increased (entries 1–4, Table 1); the structure of BC was established by comparison of the spectroscopic data
with that reported in the literature.27 Also, its structure was unambiguously established by single crystal
X-ray crystallography, (see Supporting Informtaion, Figure S1). The product BC was also isolated in 52–64%
yields when the reaction was carried out after oxidation in toluene–acetonitrile
mixtures by varying the equivalent of the base employed and the duration
of the reaction (entries 5–7). Although the reactions did lead
to the desired product in moderate-to-very good yields in solvents
such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane (DCE), DMSO, acetonitrile,
and so forth, the best result was obtained when the reaction was conducted
over a period of 20 h in DCE by employing 2.4 equiv of the ylide and
4.6 equiv of NaHCO3 (entry 12); the product was isolated
in 75% yield. Thus, the one-pot synthetic procedure using the reagent
system IBX/Ph3PCHCO2Et/NaHCO3 (1.2/2.4/4.6
equiv) was applied to a variety of naphthols to access diverse carboethoxy-substituted BCs, the results of which are collected in Scheme 2.

c The duration here refers to
the reaction time for conversion of 1,2-quinone to the end products.

d Reaction was carried out at
40 °C.

As can be seen, a number of ethyl 2-oxo-2H-benzo[h]chromene-4-carboxylates (BCs) are obtained in respectable isolated yields. All the products
were characterized by comprehensive spectroscopic data. Regardless
of the nature of the substituent present and the substitution pattern
of β-naphthol, the reactions were found to go to completion
within 24–36 h, as monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
As is evident from Scheme 2, α- and β-naphthol and α-bromo-β-naphthol
yielded the parent BC in high yields. It should be mentioned
that the formation of another isomer, characterized as naphthofuranone
(NF), that is, (E)-ethyl 2-(2-oxonaphtho[1,2-b]furan-3(2H)-ylidene)acetate (NF), was also obtained in most cases; the yield of the latter varied
from 3 to 12%. Exception is the case of 4-methoxy-α-naphthol,
which yielded almost 57% of an inseparable mixture of NF (NF-5-OMe) and BC (BC-6-OMe), as revealed by 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of the
mixture (see Supporting Information, Figure
S12). As can be seen, bromo-substitution of naphthol at 4 and 6 positions
leads to the corresponding BCs in very good yields; 4-bromo-α-naphthol
and 6-bromo-β-naphthol afforded the corresponding BCs (BC-6-Br and BC-8-Br) in 64 and 74% yields,
respectively. In fact, 6-bromo-β-naphthol yielded the corresponding BC (BC-8-Br) in the highest yield. Also, the
formation of the minor NF isomer was not observed in
these cases. 6-Hydroxy- and 7-acetoxy-β-naphthols also yielded
likewise hydroxyl- and acetoxy-BCs (BC-8-OH and BC-9-OAc) as the only products in 55 and 68% yields,
respectively. On the other hand, NFs were isolated as
minor products in 3 and 6% yields from the differently substituted
6-p-tolyl-β-naphthol and 4-p-tolyl-α-naphthol. Intriguingly, NF isomers were
found to be formed in high yields from various methoxy-substituted
naphthols. For 6-methoxy-β-naphthol and 8-methoxy-β-naphthol,
the minor NF isomers (NF-7-OMe and NF-9-OMe) were isolated in 9 and 12% yields, respectively;
of course, BCs were obtained as the major products in
52 (BC-8-OMe) and 31% (BC-10-OMe) yields.
As mentioned earlier, NF and BC isomers,
isolated as a mixture in near equal yields from 4-methoxy-α-naphthol,
could not be separated; the combined yield of the two products is
57%. The steric and electronic factors evidently manifest differently
leading to varying ratios of BC and NF.
It is not immediately apparent to us as to how the steric and electronic
factors prevail in different naphthols leading to the observed product
distributions.

Mechanism of One-Pot Cascade Reactions
As mentioned
at the outset, the formation of BCs/naphthofuranones
involves a cascade of several reactions. The mechanism of cascade
reactions was probed with β-naphthol as a representative substrate
by 1H NMR spectroscopy, cf. Figure 3. Accordingly, initial oxidation of β-naphthol
with IBX in DMSO leads cleanly to the formation of ortho-naphthoquinone I-1 (Scheme 3) within 15–25 min as revealed by
TLC analysis; o-iodoxybenzoic acid is produced as
the reduction product, and this transformation has been sufficiently
investigated.21a,21b Subsequently, the addition of
base and ylide furnishes the Wittig olefination product I-2, whose identity is evidenced from the appearance of a distinct olefinic
signal in 1H NMR at 6.84 ppm, cf. Figure 3. In the presence of excess ylide, one observes
disappearance of this signal with concomitant appearance of the signals
attributed to the formation of BC and NF. Indeed, as the reaction goes to completion, the signal attributed
to I-2 at 6.84 ppm (Figure 3) vanishes completely. Clearly, the excess
ylide attacks the intermediate I-2 in a Michael addition
fashion leading to the adduct, which may undergo base-mediated elimination
of triphenylphosphine to yield hydroxynaphthalene-fumarate as product I-4; the cluttered signals in NMR preclude identification
of this intermediate. The latter, upon deprotonation with NaHCO3, may partition itself between intramolecular 5-exo and 6-exo
cyclizations leading to five-membered oxonaphtho[1,2-b]furan-3(2H)-ylidene (NF) and six-membered
4-carbethoxybenzocoumarin (BC), respectively. The relative
rates of these cyclizations evidently manifest in the observed ratios
of the isomeric products with the BC being formed in
most cases predominantly.

Excited-State Properties of BCs
The absorption
and emission spectra of nine differently substituted BCs, that is, BC, BC-6-Br, BC-8-Br, BC-8-OH, BC-8-OMe, BC-10-OMe, BC-9-OAc, BC-6-Tol, and BC-8-Tol, were recorded in three different solvents, namely, cyclohexane,
acetonitrile, and methanol, which are representative of nonpolar,
polar aprotic, and polar protic solvents, respectively. An exception
was the case of BC-8-OH for which toluene was employed
instead of cyclohexane because of solubility issues. The concentrations
of the solutions of all compounds employed for spectral acquisitions
were typically in the range of 10–30 μM. The UV–vis
absorption spectra recorded at ca. 25 °C for all compounds were
found to taper off in the region of 450–475 nm. As can be seen
in Figure 4, the absorptions
are not much influenced by variation of the solvent from cyclohexane
to acetonitrile to methanol. However, dramatic changes are noteworthy
in the emission spectra. The parent 4-carboethoxybenzocoumarin, that
is, BC, shows a very structured emission in cyclohexane
in the region between 400 and 650 nm with a maximum at 455 nm. In
contrast, the emission maximum shifts to 510 and 515 nm in acetonitrile
and methanol solvents, respectively. Additionally, the emissions are
devoid of a structured feature and are broad. A similar behavior is
observed for all BCs with the exception of BC-8-OH and BC-6-Tol (see Supporting Information, Figure S5); the latter two compounds show broad emission in the
nonpolar solvent as well. The emission maxima were found to shift
bathochromically in a polar protic solvent such as methanol, which
is suggestive of polar excited states. Thus, all the molecules were
found to show solvatochromic emission behavior. The absorption and
emission maxima along with the observed Stokes shifts in the three
chosen solvents are collected in Table 2. The Stokes shifts were found to vary from 78 to 163
nm with the maximum shift being observed for BC-6-Tol. The above trends in Stokes shifts are in good agreement with those
observed for different coumarin derivatives with substituents at different
positions.28 It is well known that coumarins
bearing electron-withdrawing substituents at position 4 exhibit larger
Stokes shifts than those bearing the same substituents at position
3. In general, the Stokes shift is an outcome of several electronic
factors active in a given molecule, for example, the electron-donating/withdrawing
power of the substituent, degree of electron delocalization, charge
transfer, etc. In 4-carboethoxybenzocoumarins, the observed trends
in Stokes shifts may be attributed largely to intramolecular charge
transfer in the excited states.28 Because
of the more planar structure of 3-substituted coumarins, the energy
band gap between the ground and excited states is relatively small.
In contrast, 4-substituted coumarins are associated with a higher
energy gap, which is responsible for their higher Stokes shift values.

Notably, the excited-state properties, that is, quantum
yields of emission, singlet lifetimes, nonradiative decay rate constants,
and so forth, for this class of BC–esters have
been examined only little, if any.14,29 We therefore
undertook a comprehensive investigation of their fluorescence quantum
yields and excited-state lifetimes in three solvents; the quantum
yields were determined against quinine sulfate as the standard. The
singlet lifetimes were obtained by picosecond time-correlated single
photon counting. These data for all the compounds are consolidated
in Table 2.

A
perusal of the data in the Table 2 shows that best quantum yields are observed for the
parent BC in all the three solvents; the quantum yields
are as high as 30–36% in cyclohexane and acetonitrile. However,
the quantum yield decreases to ca. 15% in methanol. Bromo substitution
depreciates the quantum yields in all the three solvents as reflected
by the data for BC-6-Br and BC-8-Br; evidently,
the heavy-atom effect plays a significant role in these systems. For
these two compounds, not only are the quantum yields of fluorescence
lower in all the three solvents when compared to those of the parent BC but also the singlet lifetimes too are shorter, in particular,
in cyclohexane and acetonitrile. Otherwise, for all other compounds,
the following observations hold true: (a) hydroxy (BC-8-OH) and methoxy (BC-8-OMe) groups at the C8 and C10 (BC-10-OMe) position exert strong influence in that the polar
excited state is seemingly stabilized in a polar aprotic solvent such
as acetonitrile, leading to respectable quantum yields of emission
(ca. 20–23%) and longer lifetimes (ca. 6–7 ns); however,
the hydroxy-substituted one (BC-8-OH) shows comparatively
lower quantum yields and shorter lifetime than the methoxy-substituted BCs in a polar protic solvent such as methanol attesting to
the fact that hydrogen-bond-mediated proton-transfer quenching mechanism
is likely to contribute to the deactivation of the excited state.30 (b) p-Tolyl-substitution at
C8-position modifies the absorption and emission properties through
extended conjugation; higher quantum yields and longer singlet lifetimes
are noteworthy. However, a similar substitution at C6-position hinders
conjugation through the steric effect, leading to promotion of deactivation
mechanisms through torsional motions as reflected by very short lifetimes
and low quantum yields in all the solvents. (c) Acetoxy substitution
at C9-position seemingly serves as an electron-withdrawing group,
leading presumably to a decrease in the charge-transfer character,
which is reflected in short lifetimes in a polar aprotic solvent such
as acetonitrile. In a nutshell, most 4-carboethoxybenzocoumarins show
respectable quantum yields of emission in nonpolar solvents (20–30%)
and those with polar effects exhibit longer singlet lifetimes and
better emission in a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile. Of
course, a drastic reduction in both quantum efficiencies and singlet
lifetimes is observed for all in a polar protic solvent such as methanol.

Conclusions
One-pot synthesis of 4-alkoxycarbonylbenzocoumarins
was surmised starting from α-/β-naphthols via initial
oxidation of the latter to 1,2-naphthoquinones followed by a cascade
of reactions involving Wittig olefination, Michael addition, β-elimination,
and cyclization. It is shown that diverse 4-carboethoxybenzo[h]coumarins can be accessed in a facile manner and in respectable
isolated yields starting from α- and β-naphthols. The
structures of two BCs and also that of a concomitantly
formed minor isomer, that is, NF, have been unambiguously
established by X-ray crystallographic studies. Furthermore, we have
comprehensively investigated the excited-state properties, quantum
yields of emission, and singlet lifetimes for a series of 4-carboethoxybenzo[h]coumarins. The excited states of most BCs are considerably polar, as reflected by large Stokes shifts and
solvent-dependent absorption features. They are found to exhibit respectable
quantum yields of emission in nonpolar and polar aprotic solvents.
For the derivatives with substituents that render the excited states
polar, high quantum yields of emission and longer lifetimes are observed
in a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile with quite the opposite
being observed in a polar protic solvent. Of course, the substituents
such as bromine attenuate both emission and lifetimes.

Experimental Section
General Aspects
The commercially available starting
materials were used as received without any further purification.
The solvents were distilled prior to use. Reaction monitoring was
done using Merck TLC silica plates, and the compounds were purified
by column chromatography using silica gel of 100–200 mesh.
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on
400 and 500 MHz spectrometers. The electrospray ionization (ESI) mass
spectra were recorded on an ESI-QTOF machine. IR spectra
were recorded on a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer. Melting
points of all the compounds were determined using a standard apparatus.

Synthesis of Carboalkoxy-Substituted Coumarins
The
procedure for the synthesis of carboalkoxy-substituted benzocoumarin
from β-naphthol is described below. A similar procedure was
followed for the synthesis of other BCs.

To a solution
of naphthol (100 mg, 0.69 mmol) in 0.5 mL of DMSO was added IBX (0.23
g, 0.83 mmol), and the resultant mixture was allowed to stir in the
open atmosphere. After complete conversion to the ortho-naphthoquinone intermediate in 15–30 min as revealed by the
complete disappearance of the naphthol in TLC monitoring, the reaction
mixture was diluted with 20 mL of DCE. Subsequently, NaHCO3 (267 mg, 3.19 mmol) and the triphenylcarbethoxymethylenephosphorane
ylide (0.58 g, 1.66 mmol) were introduced into the reaction pot. The
reaction was allowed to stir at 40 °C, and the progress was monitored.
After the reaction was over (24–36 h), the contents were transferred
to a separating funnel, and the organic matter was extracted with
chloroform. The extract was washed with NaHCO3, dried over
anhyd Na2SO4, and concentrated under vacuum.
The crude reaction was subsequently subjected to column chromatography
using EtOAc/pet ether (1:10) as an eluant to afford the BC as a yellow solid in 70% yield. The minor isomer was isolated in
6% yield.

Single-Crystal X-ray Structure Determinations
As mentioned
earlier, the structures of BC and one of its derivatives,
that is, BC-9-OAc, were determined by X-ray crystallography,
see Supporting Information, Figure S1.
The single crystals of BC and BC-9-OAc were
grown by slow evaporation of their solutions in chloroform. Likewise,
the structure of one of the side products, that is, NF, was also determined by X-ray crystallography. The crystals of NF were obtained by liquid diffusion method, whereby hexane
was allowed to gradually diffuse into its solution in chloroform.
The crystals thus grown were subjected to intensity data collection,
and the structures were determined and refined subsequently, cf. the Supporting Information for crystal data.

UV–Vis Absorption and Steady-State Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The spectroscopic measurements were carried out using spectroscopic-grade
solvents. The UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded at 298
K using a Shimadzu UV-1800 double-beam spectrophotometer with an accuracy
of ±1 nm. The steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded
on a Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer with an accuracy of ±1 nm.
For both the cases, standard quartz spectrophotometer cells of path
length 1 cm were used. The slit width for the excitation and the emission
monochromator was kept 2/2 nm for all the measurements. The purities
of the compounds were confirmed by recording excitation spectra in
each case with respect to three different emission wavelengths. The
fluorescence quantum yields were measured in three different solvents
against quinine sulfate as the standard.

Time-Resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The fluorescence
lifetime measurements were carried out using a commercial TCSPC setup
(Life Spec II, Edinburgh instruments, U.K.). The diode laser of wavelength
375 nm and pulse width ∼88 ps (EPL-375, Edinburgh Instruments,
U.K.) was employed for excitation of the sample. The full width at
half-maximum of the instrument response function (IRF) is ∼120
ps with a setup target of 8000 counts. The emission polarizer was
positioned at the magic angle (54.7°) polarization with respect
to the excitation polarizer. The IRF was measured using a suspension
of the scatterer (Ludox) in water with the emission monochromator
set at the same wavelength as the excitation source. The commercial
software FAST (version of the software) supplied by the same company
was used to fit the fluorescence decays. The average lifetime of the
compound was measured from the sum of the lifetime components multiplied
by their weighted amplitudes (eq 131) via the reconvolution process.
Furthermore, the lifetime decays were fitted to either single exponential
or bi-exponential functions. Fluorescence lifetime decay of each compound
was measured by monitoring the photons at the fluorescence maximum. 1  where I(t) and I(0) are the fluorescence intensity at time t and 0, respectively, t is the time, and
αi and τi are the contributing amplitude and their corresponding lifetimes,
respectively. The quality of the fitted data was judged from the reduced
chi-squared value (χ2), by using FAST software provided
with the instrument.
