The reactive cysteine residue at
position 106 (Cys106) of DJ-1
is preferentially oxidized under oxidative stress, generating oxidized
DJ-1 (oxDJ-1). Oxidation of Cys106 to sulfinic acid changes the biologic
action of DJ-1 and increases its cytoprotective properties. The similar
activation step is known in peroxiredoxins (Prxs), in which oxidation
of reactive Cys to sulfinic acid induces polymerization of Prxs and
changes its enzyme characteristic from peroxidase to molecular chaperone.
In the present study, oxDJ-1 was prepared and its polymerization and
related amino acid residues were investigated. We found that oxDJ-1
formed a characteristic polymer with disulfide bonds and with noncovalent
and covalent binding other than disulfide. The physiological concentration
of glutathione resolved the polymer form of oxDJ-1, and glutathionylation
of other two Cys residues, such as Cys 46 and 53, was detected. Mutant
analysis indicated the necessity not only of Cys106 but also of Cys46
for the polymer formation. The cellular experiment demonstrated that
the electrophilic quinone treatment induced a high-molecular-weight
complex containing oxDJ-1. Dynamic polymerization of oxDJ-1 with a
ring and a stacked structure was observed by an atomic force microscope.
Collectively, these results clearly demonstrated the characteristic
polymer formation of oxDJ-1 with a disulfide bond and noncovalent
and covalent binding other than disulfide, which might be related
to the biologic function of oxDJ-1.

==== Body
Introduction
DJ-1 is a member of
the DJ-1/Hsp31/PfpI superfamily, and its function
as a molecular chaperone has been reported.1,2 An
apparent molecular mass of the DJ-1 monomer is 22 kDa in sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), forming a dimer
in physiological condition. DJ-1 is a multifunctional protein that
is involved in various physiological processes, including transcriptional
regulation, signal transduction, and mitochondrial function.3 DJ-1 is related to regulate the transcriptional
activity of Nrf2 and p53 and to change glutathione (GSH) metabolism
and the expression levels of heat-shock and uncoupling proteins.4 DJ-1 is also identified as a regulator of the
20S proteasome.5 DJ-1 plays a significant
role in antioxidative defense; its loss of function increases the
sensitivity of cell death induced by oxidative stress.6 DJ-1 regulates signal mediators of oxidative stress, such
as ASK1 and PTEN, via direct interactions with these proteins.7 The function of DJ-1 as a redox-activated chaperone
might account for these multiple interacting proteins and functions.
DJ-1 is known as a product of PARK7, a causative
gene of familial form of Parkinson’s disease, and its loss
of function with mutation is related to the onset of this neurodegenerative
disease.8

DJ-1 possesses three cysteine
residues at positions 46 (Cys46),
53 (Cys53), and 106 (Cys106), which play an important role in the
biological function of DJ-1.9 Cys106 is
a critical residue for DJ-1 function, and several studies demonstrated
that Cys106 substitution to Ser mutant lost its biological function,
including its role in antioxidative defense.6,9 Cys106
is a reactive cysteine with a depressed pKa of 5.4, in which thiolate accepts a hydrogen bond from a protonated
side chain of glutamate at position 18.10 Cys106 is sequentially oxidized to cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH),
cysteine sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H), and cysteine sulfonic
acid (Cys-SO3H).11 DJ-1 oxidation
is induced by several oxidative stimuli, such as hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2), paraquat, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine,
and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA).11,12 It has been reported
that 6-OHDA is rapidly oxidized by molecular oxygen to generate the
superoxide anion, H2O2, and 2-hydroxy-5-(2-aminoethyl)-1,4-benzoquinone
(pQ).13 We have previously
reported that the decrease of GSH induced by arylating pQ, which is oxidatively generated from 6-OHDA, is an important step
for 6-OHDA-induced DJ-1 oxidation.14 Cys-SO2H can be oxidized to Cys-SO3H; however, Cys106-SO2H in oxidized DJ-1 is stable because of the surrounding amino
acid residues.15 The crystal structure
of human DJ-1 revealed that Cys53 at the dimer interface is within
4 Å of each other, which makes a disulfide bond.9,16 Further, the thiol residue of Cys53 is exposed to the outside and
is covalently modified by dopamine-derived arylating quinone, which
is generated in the presence of tyrosinase.17 On the other hand, Cys46 plays a relevant role for the preservation
of three-dimensional structure of DJ-1 and is not reactive against
dopamine-derived quinones.9,16,17

To detect Cys106-oxidized DJ-1 (oxDJ-1) conveniently, we have
prepared
specific antibodies (Abs) against oxDJ-1 to allow oxDJ-1-specific
western blotting, immunostaining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) to be carried out.18,19 Our recent
data suggest that oxDJ-1 levels in the brain, heart, and skeletal
muscle are high.20 These regions have high
mitochondrial loads in both mitochondrial mass and respiratory demand.
The substantial connection between oxDJ-1 and mitochondrial function
has been demonstrated.15 In addition, Cys-SO2H-driven mitochondrial localization is known to be important
in the neuroprotective role of DJ-1.16 We
prepared an oxDJ-1 recombinant protein to use as an immunogen.21 We found that the treatment of human DJ-1-expressed Escherichia coli with H2O2 resulted
in the specific oxidation of Cys106 to Cys-SO2H/-SO3H, but not in irreversible oxidation of Cys46 and Cys53, which
could be purified by His-tag-affinity chromatography. The recombinant
oxDJ-1 protein was used for western blotting and ELISA; however, its
structure was not characterized yet.

The Cys-SO2H
form of DJ-1 is postulated to be the active
form of DJ-1 with increased chaperone activity.9,22 These
properties of DJ-1 have a similarity to peroxiredoxin (Prx), which
is known to catalyze the removal of H2O2 and
organic hydroperoxides.23 The Prx family
consists of two groups, that is, 1-Cys Prx and 2-Cys Prx, depending
on the numbers of conserved Cys.24 2-Cys
Prx catalytically reduces H2O2 to water using
thioredoxin as a reductant. 2-Cys Prx has a reactive Cys residue to
be oxidized; this oxidation causes the protein structure of Prx to
shift from low-molecular-weight species to high-molecular-weight (HMW)
polymer complexes.25 This conformational
change triggers a peroxidase-to-molecular chaperone functional switch.
It has been known that the polymer formation of Prx is depending on
the oxidation of Cys and that GSH, a cellular major reductant, promotes
its structure changes from decamer to dimer via glutathionylation
of Prx and concomitantly inactivates its molecular chaperone function.26 In the case of DJ-1, oxidation-dependent increase
of chaperone activity has been identified; however, the detailed protein
structure and the role of Cys residues have not been elucidated.

In the present study, we characterized the three-dimensional structure
of the oxDJ-1 recombinant protein, particularly the role of Cys residues
and the polymer formation with covalent and noncovalent bonds. We
also examined the formation of HMW oxDJ-1 in cellular experiments.
Finally, we observed the dynamic polymer formation of oxDJ-1 using
an atomic force microscope (AFM).

Materials and Methods
Materials
Isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) and H2O2 were purchased from Wako Pure
Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). The reduced form of GSH, 6-OHDA,
catalase, and anti-β-actin (AC-15) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St Louis, MO). A protease inhibitor cocktail tablet was obtained
from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)
agarose was purchased from QIAGEN GmbH (Hilden, Germany). Benzoquinone
(BzQ) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan). Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12, 11320-033)
was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA), and fetal
bovine serum (FBS, GPK0029) was purchased from HyClone (Logan, UT).
SH-SY5Y cells were obtained from the American Tissue Type Collection
(Manassas, VA). Other chemicals used were of the highest quality commercially
available. Monoclonal antibodies against oxDJ-1 were prepared as previously
described.18

Preparation of DJ-1 and
oxDJ-1 Recombinant Protein18
Full-length
human DJ-1 cDNA (570 bp,
NM_007262) cloned into pEXP1-DEST was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS, and a fusion DJ-1
protein with a 6-His tag at the amino terminus was obtained. Until
the absorbance value of the medium at 600 nm had reached 0.5, the
bacterial culture was grown in the Luria-Bertani medium with 50 μg/mL
ampicillin. Protein expression was induced by 0.5 mM IPTG addition.
After 2 h, DJ-1 in the cells was oxidized by the addition of 150 mM
H2O2 for 15 min at 37 °C. In the case of
DJ-1 recombinant protein, H2O2 treatment was
not conducted. These recombinant proteins were purified by using Ni-NTA
agarose. The oxidation of Cys106 in purified proteins was confirmed
by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), described below. We observed by MS analysis
that Cys106 of purified recombinant oxDJ-1 protein was fully oxidized
to sulfonic acid. In addition, it was also confirmed that in oxDJ-1
recombinant protein, the unoxidized form of Cys106 was not detected.

SDS-PAGE for Western Blotting and Silver Staining
Protein
samples were denatured in the SDS sample buffer [63 mM Tris-HCl (pH
6.8) containing 0.012% bromophenol blue, 5% sucrose, and 2% SDS] for
5 min at 95 °C (nonreduced condition). To reduce protein samples,
1% beta-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) was added to SDS sample buffer and
then heat treatment was conducted. After separation of the samples
by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel), the proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P
Transfer Membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for the western blot analysis.
The membranes were blocked in a Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing
0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 5% skimmed milk powder (Snow Brand
Milk Products, Tokyo, Japan), incubated with anti-oxDJ-1 mAb (clone
M106, 1 μg/mL, ref (18)), mouse anti-DJ-1 mAb (clone 3E8, 1 μg/mL, Medical
& Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), or anti-β-actin
mAb (AC-15) at 4 °C for 18 h, and incubated with HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies for at least 1 h. After the incubation with Immobilon
Western (Millipore), the immunoreactivity was visualized with an LAS-4000
luminescence imager (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). For silver staining,
the separated proteins were stained with the Dodeca Silver Stain Kit
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).

Liquid Chromatography Coupled
with Tandem MS (LC–MS/MS)
Analysis
The oxidation of Cys in oxDJ-1 and DJ-1 recombinant
proteins was evaluated by MALDI-TOF MS. Proteins were separated by
SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. The stained band was excised,
treated with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (AB, pH 8.8) containing 50%
acetonitrile, and then dehydrated with acetonitrile. The gel pieces
were rehydrated in 25 mM AB solution-containing dithiothreitol (DTT)
(10 mM) and alkylated with iodoacetamide (55 mM). To analyze the glutathionylation,
DTT was removed. After dehydration with acetonitrile, the gel pieces
were rehydrated on ice for 30 min in 50 mM AB solution-containing
trypsin (sequence grade, 10 μg/mL, Promega) and digestion was
performed for 18 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were extracted
and concentrated with a SpeedVac (Thermo Electron). The samples were
mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and subjected to a
MALDI-TOF MS 4800 Plus (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA). Peptide samples
for detailed sequence analysis were separated and spotted on a plate
for MALDI-TOF MS analysis with a capillary liquid chromatography (LC)
system coupled to an auto-spotter DiNa ASM-T-MaP (KYA TECH, Tokyo,
Japan). UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein databases were used to identify
peptide fragments. Data were processed with the ProteinPilot 3.0 software
(AB SCIEX).

Gel Chromatography
AKTA prime plus
(GE Healthcare)
was used for the fractionation of DJ-1/oxDJ-1 recombinant proteins.
Purified DJ-1/oxDJ-1 protein samples were fractionated by using a
Sephacryl Column (HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl Columns S-300 HR, GE Healthcare)
equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM NaCl.
To determine the molecular weight, following standard proteins were
used: 240K, mouse catalase; 160K, bovine γ-globulins; 66K, bovine
serum albumin (BSA); and 44K, ovalbumin.

Cell Culture and Treatment
Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y
cells were routinely maintained in a D-MEM/F-12 medium containing
10% heat-inactivated FBS and antibiotics (0.05 U/mL penicillin, 0.05
mg/mL streptomycin; Invitrogen) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of
CO2 (5%) and air (95%). para-Quinone was
prepared as described previously.13 Indicated
concentration of 6-OHDA was dissolved in D-MEM/F12 and reacted at
37 °C for 15 min in the presence of catalase. After the reaction,
generated pQ was added to the cells. After the treatment,
cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing
150 mM NaCl, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.5% Triton X-100,
50 mM NaF, and 1 mM Na3VO4, and a protease inhibitor
cocktail tablet] at 4 °C for 30 min. Cellular debris was removed
by centrifugation. The bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) was used for the determination of protein
concentration with BSA as the standard.

Transfection of Small-Interfering
RNA (siRNA)
The human
DJ-1-siRNA were designed and manufactured by Invitrogen, according
to the current guidelines for effective knockdown by this method.
The target sequences for DJ-1-siRNA (#1: 5′-AGCAGACUCAGAUAAAUUCUGUGCG-3′
and 5′-CGCACAGAAUUUAUCUGAGUCUGCU-3′, and #2: 5′-CCAGCUUCGAGUUUGCGCUUGCAAU-3′
and 5′-AUUGCAAGCGCAAACUCGAAGCUGG-3′) were used. The
siRNAs were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells at a concentration of 100
pmol/105 cells by Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Invitrogen) 3
days before further experiments.

High-Speed AFM (HS-AFM)
Observation
AFM imaging of
DJ-1 was performed in solution using a laboratory-built HS-AFM setup.27−29 Each DJ-1 sample was deposited on a mica surface and incubated for
5–10 min. Unattached molecules were removed by washing with
observation buffer (50 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid–NaOH (pH 7.5) containing
100 mM NaCl). Imaging was carried out in the tapping mode, using small
cantilevers BL-AC10DS-A2 or custom-made BL-AC7DS-KU4 (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan). The set-point amplitude was 80–90% of the free oscillation
amplitude, and the cantilever-free oscillation amplitude was ∼1.5
nm. The imaging rate, scan size, and feedback parameters were optimized
to enable visualization with a minimum tip force. The obtained HS-AFM
image sequences were processed and analyzed by a custom software.

Statistical Analysis
Data are reported as mean ±
standard deviation of at least three independent experiments. The
statistical significance of the difference between the determinations
was calculated by an analysis of variance using Tukey’s test
for multiple comparisons. The calculation method was described in
each figure legend. Values of p < 0.05 were considered
significant.

Results
Formation of HMW Polymer
in Oxidized DJ-1
On the basis
of the previous studies showing the oxidation-dependent chaperone
activity of DJ-1 and polymerization of Prxs, we determined the MW
of oxDJ-1 under nondenaturing conditions. To prepare oxDJ-1 recombinant
protein, E. coli expressing human DJ-1
was treated with H2O2, then cells were lysed,
and oxDJ-1 recombinant protein was purified by Ni-NTA column chromatography,
as described previously.18 The oxidation
of almost all Cys106 to Cys-SO2H/SO3H was confirmed
by LC–MS/MS analysis. Next, oxDJ-1 protein was subjected to
gel chromatography.19 Proteins in each
fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE under reduced and nonreduced conditions
and then detected by anti-DJ-1 Ab. OxDJ-1 bands were detected not
only in dimer at 44–66 kDa standard proteins of gel chromatography
(Fr. 20–24) but also in the polymer at 160–240 kDa standard
proteins of gel chromatography (Fr. 12–17) (Figure 1A). Fr. 11 was a void fraction.
We found that under nonreduced condition, HMW bands of oxDJ-1 at 60,
120, and 250 kDa were detected in Fr. 12 and 13 by western blotting,
whereas these oxDJ-1 bands were mostly detected at 25 kDa under reduced
conditions (Figure 1A). These results suggest that detected HMW bands of oxDJ-1 at 60–250
kDa in Fr. 12 and 13 are formed via disulfide bonds between oxDJ-1
molecules. Further, the polymer form of oxDJ-1 at 160–240 kDa
in Fr. 12 and 13 is formed via noncovalent bonds between HMW oxDJ-1
molecules; therefore, it is considered that the polymer form of oxDJ-1
is formed via both disulfide and noncovalent bonds. In addition, a
reducing agent-resistance band at 45 kDa was observed under reduced
conditions, which suggested the presence of a covalent bond form of
oxDJ-1 other than a disulfide bond (Figure 1A). These bands recognized by anti-DJ-1 Ab
were detected by silver staining of proteins. The HMW bands of DJ-1
in western blotting were obvious rather than those in silver staining.
A concentration-dependent study of H2O2 for
DJ-1 oxidation suggests the concentration-dependent increase of HMW
oxDJ-1 at 60 and 120 kDa, which approximately corresponds to dimer
and tetramer (Supporting Information Figure
S1).

Figure 1 Polymer formation of oxidized DJ-1 via noncovalent and covalent
binding. (A) Polymer formation of oxDJ-1 recombinant protein. Purified
oxDJ-1 protein was separated by gel chromatography, and the oxDJ-1
content of each fraction was determined by using western blot analysis
under nonreduced (upper panel) and reduced condition (lower panel).
The fractions where each standard protein was eluted are indicated
by arrows. The results of silver staining at Fr. 13 and 25 are shown
in the right of each panel. These results suggest that detected HMW
bands of oxDJ-1 at 60–250 kDa in Fr. 12 and 13 (nonreduced,
WB) are formed via disulfide bonds between oxDJ-1 molecules and that
the polymer form of oxDJ-1 at 160–240 kDa in Fr. 12 and 13
is formed via noncovalent bonds between HMW oxDJ-1 molecules. It is
considered that the polymer form of oxDJ-1 is formed via both disulfide
and noncovalent bonds. (B) Gel chromatography of DJ-1 recombinant
protein. Purified DJ-1 protein was subjected to gel chromatography
as described above. The polymer form of DJ-1 was not detected clearly
at Fr. 12 and 13.

In the case of DJ-1 recombinant
protein, a dimer form with a disulfide
and a covalent bond other than a disulfide bond were detected; however,
the polymer form of DJ-1 was not detected clearly at Fr. 12 and 13
(Figure 1B). In the
western blotting of native DJ-1 under both reducing and nonreducing
conditions, HMW DJ-1 was slightly observed from Fr. 23 to Fr. 25,
where were fractions of dimer or monomer in gel chromatography, which
suggests the formation of HMW bands during the sample preparation
for SDS-PAGE. Collectively, these results suggest that there is a
characteristic polymeric form of oxDJ-1 with a disulfide bond and
noncovalent and covalent binding other than a disulfide bond.

Depolymerization
of oxDJ-1 by GSH and Glutathionylation of oxDJ-1
Next, we
evaluated the effects of reducing agents, such as 2-ME,
DTT, and GSH, on polymer formation of oxDJ-1. These reducing agents
at 1 and 2 mM were added to oxDJ-1 recombinant protein in Tris-buffered
saline, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE
under nonreduced conditions. The HMW bands of oxDJ-1 in silver staining
were weak but obvious in the control lane (Figure 2A). Relatively strong reducing agents, such
as 2-ME and DTT, could reduce HMW bands of oxDJ-1, particularly the
60 and 120 kDa band, whereas GSH at physiological intracellular concentrations
slightly but obviously decreased HMW oxDJ-1 (Figure 2A). Further, we found the depolymerization
of oxDJ-1 by GSH treatment in gel chromatography analysis (Figure 2B). To characterize
the action of GSH on oxDJ-1, LC–MS/MS analysis was conducted
for each band detected by protein staining. As a result, we found
glutathionylated Cys at positions 46 and 53 of oxDJ-1 at the 60 kDa
band (Figure 2C). Glutathionylation
of oxDJ-1 at the 60 kDa band was also observed in western blot analysis
using anti-GSH Ab, whereas glutathionylation was not observed in GSH-treated
DJ-1 (Figure 2D). Glutathionylation
of oxDJ-1 at 60 kDa band was completed during 1 h and was detected
stably to 6 h at 37 °C (Supporting Information Figure S2). Glutathionylated oxDJ-1 was observed around the dimer
form of oxDJ-1 in gel chromatography analysis (Figure 2E). Taken together, these results suggest
that oxDJ-1 is depolymerized via the reduction of Cys46 and Cys53,
implying the significant role of disulfide bond formation for the
polymerization of oxDJ-1.

Figure 2 Depolymerization of oxidized DJ-1 by GSH. (A)
Effects of reducing
agent on oxDJ-1 polymerization. Reducing agents such as GSH, 2-ME,
and DTT were added to oxDJ-1 recombinant proteins in tris-buffered
saline (pH 7.4) and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Protein
samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing condition and
visualized by silver staining. We found that reducing agents could
reduce HMW bands of oxDJ-1, particularly the 60 and 120 kDa band.
(B,C) GSH-treated oxDJ-1 protein was separated by gel chromatography,
and proteins in each fraction were detected by silver staining under
nonreducing condition (B). Detected bands were subjected to in-gel
digestion (C). Peptide samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Identified
peptide sequences with confidence intervals greater than 95% are shown
in green. The sequences indicated by yellow and red correspond to
confidence intervals higher than 50% and lower than 50%, respectively.
The MS/MS spectrum of peptides predicted to contain Cys-GSH. We found
glutathionylated Cys at positions 46 and 53 of oxDJ-1 at the 60 kDa
band. (D) GSH-treated oxDJ-1 and DJ-1 proteins were subjected to western
blot analysis using anti-GSH and anti-DJ-1 antibodies. Glutathionylation
of oxDJ-1 at 60 kDa was detected. (E) GSH-treated oxDJ-1 was subjected
to gel chromatography, and each fraction was subjected to western
blotting using anti-GSH antibody. Glutathionylated oxDJ-1 was detected
around dimer form.

Substantial Role of Cys46
for the Polymerization of oxDJ-1
To determine the role of
Cys residue of DJ-1 for the polymerization
of oxDJ-1, we prepared mutant recombinant proteins, in which Cys was
substituted to Ser. To confirm the role of irreversible oxidation
at Cys106 on polymerization, E. coli-expressing mutant DJ-1 (C106S) was similarly treated with H2O2 and polymerization of purified oxDJ-1 (C106S)
protein was analyzed by gel chromatography and western blotting. The
LC–MS/MS analysis of oxDJ-1 (C106S) showed the mutation of
Cys106 to Ser and reversible oxidation of Cys53 (Table 1). Cys46 of oxDJ-1 (C106S) was
not detected (Table 1). Seventy-five and 150 kDa bands of HMW oxDJ-1 (C106S) were detected
under nonreduced conditions and at 75 and 60 kDa bands under reduced
conditions, respectively; however, the polymer form of oxDJ-1 (C106S)
around Fr. 12 was not observed (Figure 3A). We further analyzed the polymerization of double
mutant DJ-1 (C46/53S) treated with H2O2. Irreversible
oxidation of Cys106 and mutation of Cys53 to Ser were confirmed by
LC–MS/MS analysis, whereas Cys46 was not detected (Table 1). In gel chromatography
analysis, obvious formation of polymer in oxDJ-1 (C46/53S) was not
observed (Figure 3B).

(A,B) Purified recombinant protein of oxidized DJ-1(C106S) (A) and
oxidized DJ-1(C46/53S) (B) was separated by gel chromatography and

under nonreduced (upper panel) and reduced condition (lower panel),
respectively. The fractions where each standard protein was eluted
are indicated by arrows. The results of silver staining at indicated
Fr. are shown in the right of each panel. The polymer form of oxDJ-1
(C106S) (A) and oxDJ-1 (C46/53S) (B) around Fr. 12 was not observed.

proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE under reduced condition and then were visualized
by protein staining. The band corresponding to oxDJ-1 was subjected
to in-gel digestion and MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Identified peptide
sequences with confidence intervals greater than 95% are shown in
the sequence column, and the position of Cys is indicated with an
underline. Identified modification of Cys is shown in the modification
of Cys column. Carbamidomethyl, carbamidomethyl Cys; dehydroalanine,
the position of Cys was detected as dehydroalanine; trioxidation,
cysteine sulfonic acid (Cys-SO3H); serine, the position
of Cys was detected as Ser.

We further analyzed polymer formation of a single mutant oxDJ-1
(C46S) and oxDJ-1 (C53S). Because expression levels of both single
mutants were low and LC–MS/MS analysis of both mutants was
difficult, we confirmed irreversible oxidation of Cys106 by specific
Ab against oxDJ-1. We confirmed the oxidation of Cys106 of DJ-1 (C46S)
(Figure 4A) and DJ-1
(C53S) (Figure 4B)
to Cys-SO2H/SO3H by H2O2 treatment. These single mutants were subjected to the gel chromatography
analysis. We found that oxDJ-1(C53S) (Figure 4D), but not oxDJ-1(C46S) (Figure 4C), formed a polymer, which
suggests the substantial role of Cys46 for the polymerization of oxDJ-1.

(A) and oxidized DJ-1(C53S) (B) was subjected to western blot analysis
using anti-DJ-1 and oxDJ-1 Ab, respectively. The oxidation of Cys106
of DJ-1 (C46S) (A) and DJ-1 (C53S) (B) to Cys-SO2H/SO3H by H2O2 treatment was confirmed by
western blot analysis using oxDJ-1 Ab. (C,D) These recombinant proteins
were further separated by gel chromatography and protein content of
each fraction was determined by using western blot analysis under
reduced condition. The fractions where each standard protein was eluted
were indicated by arrows. We found that oxDJ-1(C53S) (D), but not
oxDJ-1(C46S) (C), formed a polymer, which suggests the substantial
role of Cys46 for the polymerization of oxDJ-1.

Formation of a Covalently Bound oxDJ-1 by Arylating Quinones
As described above, oxDJ-1 formed a covalent bond dimer other than
disulfide bond. To further get insight for the formation of a covalent
bond oxDJ-1, we examined the effects of arylating quinone based on
the previous report.17 At first, purified
DJ-1 and oxDJ-1 recombinant proteins were incubated with arylating pQ generated from 6-OHDA at 37 °C for 1 h and then
subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting under reducing conditions
to evaluate the formation of a covalent bond dimer. In both DJ-1 and
oxDJ-1 recombinant proteins, we observed the increase of HMW bands
with a covalent bond other than a disulfide bond by western blotting
and protein staining (Figure 5A). It was notable that the formed HMW bands were relatively
high in pQ-treated oxDJ-1 (Figure 5A). We also examined the effects of arylating
BzQ on the formation of HMW bands in both DJ-1 and oxDJ-1 (Figure 5B). These results
suggest that arylating quinone can form HMW DJ-1/oxDJ-1 with a covalent
bond other than a disulfide bond.

Figure 5 Formation of a covalently bound DJ-1 and
oxDJ-1 by arylating quinones.
(A,B) Purified recombinant DJ-1 (upper panel) and oxDJ-1 proteins
(lower panel) were incubated with each concentration of arylating para-quinone (pQ) (A) and BzQ (B) at 37
°C for 1 h, respectively. After incubation, the formation of
a covalently bound DJ-1 and oxDJ-1 with HMW was evaluated by SDS-PAGE
and western blotting under reducing condition, respectively. We found
that arylating quinone can form HMW DJ-1/oxDJ-1 with a covalent bond
other than a disulfide bond.

The formation of HMW DJ-1/oxDJ-1 with a covalent bond by
arylating
quinone was evaluated in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Cells
were treated with pQ and BzQ for 3 h at 37 °C,
and then whole cell lysates were subjected to western blotting using
anti-DJ-1 and anti-oxDJ-1 mAb under reduced conditions, respectively.
An obvious HMW DJ-1 band with a covalent bond, particularly at the
50 kDa band, was detected (Figure 6A). OxDJ-1 blotting also showed that the HMW band at
50 kDa contains oxDJ-1 (Figure 6A). Quinone treatments were extended to 6 h, but no obvious
change of HMW band levels was observed (Supporting Information Figure S3). A concentration-dependent study of
BzQ suggests that the 50 kDa HMW band forms in a concentration-dependent
manner from 50 μM BzQ treatment (Supporting Information Figure S4). The specificity of the HMW band was
further confirmed by DJ-1-deficient SH-SY5Y cells, which were prepared
by a siRNA method (Figure 6B). In nontransfected and negative control oligo-transfected
cells, the formation of HMW DJ-1 at 50 kDa was observed by BzQ treatment,
whereas this HMW band was significantly decreased in DJ-1 siRNA-treated
cells (Figure 6C).

was detected by western blot analysis using anti-DJ-1 and oxDJ-1 Ab.

Atomic Force Microscope Observation of the
Polymer Form of oxDJ-1
Finally, we investigated the structural
characterization of DJ-1/oxDJ-1
recombinant protein by AFM, which can observe the structure of biological
samples at a nanometer scale in a state close to the nature in various
environments, including liquid.30 In the
AFM analysis of DJ-1 recombinant protein, we observed that DJ-1 protein
had a uniform shape in general and partly had some high/large molecules
(as indicated by arrows, Figure 7A). The enlarged AFM image showed that approximately
70–80% of the molecules had a cylindrical shape (as indicated
by a dotted line, Figure 7A). It is thought that this AFM image of DJ-1 molecule was
consistent with the reported X-ray crystal structure of the DJ-1 dimer.
In addition, the remaining 20–30% was lower than this cylindrical
molecule and diffusing vigorously (Supporting Information S5 Movie_DJ-1), which suggests the presence of
a monomer form of DJ-1.

and oxidized DJ-1 recombinant

Scale bars are shown in each picture. Some high/large molecules are
indicated by each single arrow, and typical DJ-1 molecule with a cylindrical

recombinant protein is shown. Some high/large molecules are indicated
by each single arrow. The enlarged AFM image of oxDJ-1 with a tetramer
or the ring structure is indicated by the arrows. (C) Several variants
of the oxDJ-1 polymer form are shown with a schematic diagram. Movies
of these observations are shown in Supporting Information S6 and S7 Movie_oxDJ-1.

In the case of AFM analysis of oxDJ-1 recombinant protein,
we found
that the oxDJ-1 protein had a nonuniform shape with variations in
molecular height compared to that of DJ-1 (Figure 7B). Focusing on large molecules, we found
two distinct structures: a tetramer structure and a ring structure
with an approximate hexamer (indicated by arrows, Figure 7B). The frequency of a tetramer
was higher than the ring structure; these two forms were not observed
in DJ-1, which suggests the oxidation-dependent formation. The polymer
form of oxDJ-1 recombinant was fractionated by gel chromatography
and subjected to AFM analysis; however, the AFM observation was similar
and it appears that these polymer forms are partly broken by the procedure
to bind oxDJ-1 protein to the mica surface. The further observation
of the tetramer structure suggests several variants of the oxDJ-1
polymer form (Figure 7C). These possibilities are shown with a schematic diagram. One is
the tetramer or the ring under the tetramer (Figure 7C). During AFM observation, the tetramer
was broken and then the ring structure and/or tetramer were appeared
(Supporting Information S6 and S7 Movie_oxDJ-1).
These observations suggest the dynamic properties of the oxDJ-1 polymer.

Discussion
In the present study, we have revealed the formation
of a polymer
form of oxDJ-1 via several types of binding, such as disulfide bonds
and noncovalent and covalent binding other than disulfide. The recombinant
oxDJ-1 protein used in the present study was prepared by H2O2 treatment of human DJ-1-expressing E.
coli.18 The cells were
lysed and subjected to a purification procedure. This oxidation method
prepared Cys106-oxDJ-1 successfully, and Cys46 and Cys53 were not
oxidized to Cys-SO2H and/or Cys-SO3H.18,21,31 We observed that direct treatment
of DJ-1 recombinant protein with H2O2 resulted
in the random oxidation of all Cys residues,18,21 which suggested the preferential oxidation of Cys106 in intracellular
fluid. Polymer formation was not observed in the nonoxidized form
of DJ-1, which indicated the significance of Cys106 oxidation. Further,
the treatment of the polymer form of oxDJ-1 with reducing agents,
such as GSH, dissolved its complex, which indicated the critical role
of disulfide bond formation. It has been shown that the oxidation
of Cys106 proceeded under GSH depletion;14 therefore, the possibility was considered that severe deficiency
of thiols generates the polymer form of oxDJ-1.

A physiological
concentration of GSH could resolve the polymer
form of oxDJ-1 and glutathionylation of Cys residue was observed in
HMW oxDJ-1 by LC–MS/MS analysis and western blotting. Glutathionylated
Cys46 and Cys53 were mainly observed in the covalently bound dimer
form of oxDJ-1, and glutathionylation was not detected in the monomer
form of oxDJ-1 under the denaturing condition of SDS-PAGE, which suggests
that GSH bonded to Cys46 and Cys53 might be removed by further reaction
with GSH. Cys46 and Cys53 are close to the dimerization interface.16,32 Cys53 is present in the surface of DJ-1 and forms disulfide bonds
between DJ-1 molecules, whereas Cys46 is located inside the protein
and contributes to its stability in maintaining the basic structure
of DJ-1.9,33 Therefore, glutathionylation of both Cys46
and Cys53 in the covalently bound dimer form of oxDJ-1 shows that
these Cys residues appeared on the oxDJ-1 surface and reacted with
GSH, suggesting the change of three-dimensional structure of oxDJ-1.
Multiple disulfide formation was suggested by the results of Figure 1A. Not only Cys53
but also Cys46 contribute to the disulfide bond formation of the oxDJ-1
polymer. Mutant analysis showed the indispensable role of Cys46 in
polymer formation; that is, Cys46 appears to contribute to both protein
stabilization and disulfide formation in oxDJ-1.

We found that
electrophilic pQ and BzQ proceed
to form HMW DJ-1 with covalent bonds other than disulfide bond in
the in vitro experiment. These quinones could induce polymerization
of both DJ-1 and oxDJ-1 recombinants, whereas it was found that oxDJ-1
preferentially formed HMW form compared with DJ-1. Electrophiles react
not only with Cys but also with other nucleophilic amino acids such
as Lys and His.34,35 Although amino acid residue reacting
with pQ and BzQ was not identified, there is a possibility
that these electrophiles directly react with the polymer form of oxDJ-1
and stabilize its structure. It has been reported that DJ-1 is covalently
modified by dopamine quinones and that Cys53 is the most reactive
and forms a covalent dimer in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas Cys46 is not
reactive.17,36 In the cellular experiment in the present
study, the covalently bound HMW DJ-1 was found to be formed by BzQ
treatment. The band (50 kDa) was mainly detected as the HMW DJ-1/oxDJ-1
with a covalent bond in BzQ-treated SH-SY5Y-cells (Figure 6A), whereas 60 and 45 kDa bands
were detected in BzQ-treated recombinant DJ-1/oxDJ-1 (Figure 5B). The former is the products
from endogenous DJ-1/oxDJ-1 inside the cells, whereas the latter was
generated by the direct reaction of DJ-1/oxDJ-1 recombinant protein
with BzQ. It is considered that this experimental condition is one
of the causes for the difference between these. Furthermore, the components
of these experiments were different, and it is considered that the
HMW DJ-1/oxDJ-1 with a covalent bond was formed with other proteins
in BzQ-treated SH-SY5Y-cells. Western blot analysis using the oxDJ-1-specific
antibody revealed that the HMW DJ-1 complex contained oxDJ-1. The
oxDJ-1 monomer was obviously decreased by BzQ treatment, which suggested
the preferential polymer formation of oxDJ-1.

AFM is a powerful
tool for observing protein structures in solution;30,37 thus, supporting observations were obtained for the biochemical
analysis described above in the present study. In the DJ-1 recombinant
protein, the dimer form was mainly observed, whereas several forms
including polymer was observed in oxDJ-1 recombinant protein. The
AFM observation showed the presence of tetramer and hexamer oxDJ-1,
and some of these were stacked. It is also interesting to note that
these polymers were dynamic and are changing during the observation.
These observations also imply the stabilization of the oxDJ-1 polymer
by covalent bindings, such as disulfide bonds. The polymer oxDJ-1
was fractionated by gel chromatography and subjected to AFM analysis;
however, the observation was unchanged, which suggested that the fixation
of proteins to the mica surface might affect observation.

In
conclusion, this study clearly showed the formation of the polymer
form of oxDJ-1 with disulfide bond and noncovalent and covalent binding
other than disulfide. The possible model of polymerized oxDJ-1 is
shown in Figure 8.
These structural changes of DJ-1 with oxidation might relate to the
physiological role of DJ-1 on redox chaperone and antioxidative defense.
