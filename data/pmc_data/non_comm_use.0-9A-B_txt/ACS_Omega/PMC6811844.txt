The purpose of this study is to present
the poly(caprolactone) (PCL) functionalization by the covalent grafting
of poly(sodium styrene sulfonate) on electrospun scaffolds using the
“grafting from” technique and evaluate the effect of
the coating and surface wettability on the biological response. The
“grafting from” technique required energy (thermal or
UV) to induce the decomposition of the PCL (hydro)peroxides and generate
radicals able to initiate the polymerization of NaSS. In addition,
UV irradiation was used to initiate the radical polymerization of
NaSS directly from the surface (UV direct “grafting from”).
The interest of these two techniques is their easiness, the reduction
of the number of process steps, and its applicability to the industry.
The selected parameters allow controlling the grafting rate (i.e.,
degree of functionalization). The aim of the study was to compare
two covalent grafting in terms of surface functionalization and hydrophilicity
and their effect on the in vitro biological responses of fibroblasts.
The achieved results showed the influence of the sulfonate functional
groups on the cell response. In addition, outcomes highlighted that
the UV direct “grafting from” method allows to moderate
the amount of sulfonate groups and the surface hydrophilicity presents
a considerable interest for covalently immobilizing bioactive polymers
onto electrospun scaffolds designed for tissue engineering applications
using efficient post-electrospinning chemical modification.

Introduction
During the past years, electrospinning, a broadly
used technique that allows to make porous structures with fibers having
dimensions ranging from micrometer to nanometer scale,1 has offered many opportunities to adapt different
physical, chemical, and biological properties of a material for biomedical
applications. Due to its manufacturing facility, versatility, and
adaptability, electrospinning has been used in many fields including
biomedical and pharmaceutical applications and other applications
such as filtration, solid-phase extraction absorbent, waterproof fabrics,
energy applications, biosensor immunoassay, enzyme immobilization,
sensing, sound absorption, and antifungal mats.2 This process has been widely studied in tissue engineering
to generate nanofiber structures based on different biocompatible
and biodegradable polymers and produce scaffolds, which must own fundamental
characteristics such as biocompatibility, nontoxicity, porosity, and
sufficient mechanical properties.

Tissue engineering and regenerative
medicine have been the most studied applications in the biomedical
field. Indeed, the formation of a biocompatible and biodegradable
biomatrix in three dimensions composed of both a biomaterial and human
body cells is the main interest of the electrospinning techniques
in the tissue engineering field since it can mimic human tissues composed
of nanoscale fiber structures on which cells can attach, organize,
and develop.3 Electrospun membranes has
been used in tissue engineering for vascular prosthesis,4 cardiac tissue regeneration,5 cell expansion scaffolds,6 protecting
cells from oxidative stress conditions,7 bone reconstruction,8,9 cartilage,10 nerve tissue regeneration,11−13 and skin.14

Many
polymers are used in electrospinning for various applications, particularly
biomedical applications. Among these polymers, polycaprolactone (PCL),
with a widely documented use and due to its excellent mechanical properties
and slow degradation, is a suitable material for use in tissue engineering
applications.
The interaction between the biomaterial surface and cells is crucial
for biomedical devices. One of the most important physicochemical
properties of a biomaterial is the surface wettability as it allows
to modulate the protein adsorption and the consequent cell behavior.
Against the hydrophobic nature of PCL, which leads to a lack of favorable
cell response, different strategies have been established in tissue
engineering approaches. These include adsorption of biomolecules onto
the surface, the introduction of polar groups by surface treatment,
and immobilization of bioactive compounds covalently attached to the
scaffold surface.15−21

Our LBPS group’s
recent research have shown that cell adhesion and differentiation
can be favored using polymers or copolymers bearing anionic groups
such as sulfonate, carboxylate, and phosphonate.22−24 The distribution of these ionic groups along
the surface creates active sites, which can interact with extracellular
proteins, such as fibronectin, implicated in cell response. Poly(sodium
styrene sulfonate) (polyNaSS) was successfully grafted onto the surface
of different biomaterials (titanium,25−34 PET,35−37 or
PCL17−21,38), and many studies achieved in our laboratory demonstrated that
the grafting of polyNaSS onto biomaterial surfaces modulate the cellular
and bacterial response.28,32,34

As reported in previous studies,18,28,38 one of the benefits of the polyNaSS covalent
grafting onto biomaterial surfaces is to allow a great stability of
the grafting. Indeed, in vivo prostheses implantations performed in
rabbits demonstrate the maintenance of the coating biological activity
up to 12 months. Recently, polyNaSS-grafted total hip prostheses (THPs)
have been selected and allowed to be tested in a human clinical trial.

In a recent work, assuming that UV irradiations have been used
successfully for the surface modification or functionalization of
different polymers for biomedical applications, we developed a simple
method of radical grafting, which allows the successful grafting of
a bioactive polymer (polyNaSS) covalently to PCL surfaces using UV
irradiation.38 Reaction parameters have
been investigated in order to optimize the yield of polyNaSS grafting
onto PCL film surfaces. However, although our laboratory has been
successful in developing polyNaSS UV grafting on different biomaterial
surfaces,26,27,33,38 until now, this technology has never been applied
to electrospun fiber scaffolds.

Several studies report the various
possible functionalization of electrospun fiber scaffolds for biomedical
applications, but most of them present incomplete research on treatment
parameters, complexity of setups, and complexity of the technological
design of the used techniques as in the case of co-axial electrospinning
or a cylindrical-type multinozzle electrospinning system.2 Our approach is different and is set up to make
it easier, efficient, and reproducible as applicable post-electrospinning
surface functionalization. In this contribution, we investigate the
functionalization of the electrospun PCL fiber scaffold by the covalent
grafting of a bioactive polymer to develop potential scaffolds for
tissue engineering applications. To achieve this goal, we carried
out two “grafting from” techniques: (i) thermal grafting,
which requires a surface activation by ozonation, and (ii) UV grafting
with or without surface activation by ozonation, and compared the
differences between these grafting techniques in terms of surface
modification, surface hydrophilicity, and effect of the process steps
on the intrinsic PCL properties. Preliminary studies to test the biological
responses onto these functionalized electrospun PCL fiber scaffolds
were carried out to evaluate the effect of sulfonate groups together
with surface hydrophilicity on the fibroblast behavior and demonstrate
that these potential scaffolds are biologically acceptable to living
cells (biocompatible). For that, fibroblast cell viability and morphology
were evaluated onto the functionalized PCL fiber scaffolds.

Results and Discussion
PCL Fiber Scaffold Morphology
The fabrication of the
PCL fiber scaffolds is shown schematically in Figure 1. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
micrographs of the electrospun fiber scaffold microstructure are shown
in Figure 2. The electrospinning
conditions such as the concentration of polymer solution, applied
voltage, flow rate, and tip-to-collector distance were optimized to
obtain a continuous stretch of fibers, together with uniform bead-free
PCL fibers.

Figure 1 Schematic of electrospinning device.

Figure 2 SEM images

and histogram of fiber diameter distribution.

In the biological performance of the electrospun
fiber scaffold, fiber diameter and pore diameter have a primordial
role to play as it modulates the cell–cell and cell–membrane
interactions. Adequate pore size (high porosity) and interconnected
pore network are essential criteria for tissue engineering as it enables
better cell infiltration and vascularization.39 In this work, from the SEM micrographs, a fiber diameter distribution
and an average fiber diameter were determined from a minimum of 50
fibers (Figure 2).
All the PCL fibers constituting the scaffolds present a micrometer
size (>1 μm), and the average fiber diameter was measured
as 3.28 μm ± 0.3 with a narrow diameter distribution from
2.8 to 3.8 μm. Furthermore, we performed pore size measurements
as explained above. The pore size of the PCL electrospun fiber scaffold
ranged from 6 to 30 μm. As a result of the electrospinning parameters
optimized to produce these PCL fiber scaffolds, we obtained uniform
pores with a pore diameter quite large for an electrospun fiber membrane
designed for tissue engineering applications with the aim of improving
the cell penetration.39 Finally, we can
observe that the fibers cross in the different layers without having
a fusion between them (Figure 2, yellow arrows).

Characterization
of polyNaSS Grafting onto PCL Fiber Scaffold Surfaces
PolyNaSS
covalent grafting to the PCL electrospun fiber scaffold surface was
performed using the “grafting from” technique (Figure 3). The “grafting
from” process included the thermal and UV grafting. As shown
previously in studies carried out in our laboratory, radical polymerization
enables the covalent grafting of bioactive polymers onto PCL surfaces.17−21,38 This technique
requires the activation of the PCL surface by the creation of a surface
layer of PCL (hydro)peroxides by an ozone generator. Thereafter, the
PCL surfaces were immersed in an aqueous solution of NaSS monomer,
and by heating the solution or irradiating it with UV light, the decomposition
of the PCL (hydro)peroxide radicals was induced, and these radicals
initiate the polymerization of NaSS. Recently, we have demonstrated
the possibility of grafting ionic polymers directly to the PCL surface
without preliminary activation of the surface; this direct “grafting
from” without surface activation allowed us to improve the
UV grafting process by removing the activation step.38 To optimize the efficiency of polyNaSS grafting onto PCL
surfaces, we have investigated the reaction parameters and identified
the optimal process conditions in terms of polymerization time, UV
power, activation step, and monomer solution. In this article, we
applied the previously established conditions on polyNaSS grafting
onto PCL film surfaces.38 We used various
techniques to show that the covalent grafting of ionic polymers bearing
sulfonate groups was successful onto the electrospun PCL fiber scaffolds.
The presence of sulfonate groups onto the grafted PCL surface was
demonstrated using surface characterization techniques as toluidine
blue (TB) colorimetric method, contact angle measurement, Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra recorded in the attenuated total
reflection mode (ATR-FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with
Oxford energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). Possible changes in the intrinsic properties of PCL have been
studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Grafting parameters
used in this work are summarized in Table 1.

We determined the amount of polyNaSS
grafted onto the surface of the different samples using the TB colorimetric
method (Figure 4).
We found that, as for the grafting onto PCL films,38 the polyNaSS grafting rate onto the PCL fiber scaffold
reached a maximum value (1.06 ± 0.15) × 10–4 mol g–1 for UV grafting 1 h with 20 min ozonation
(UV grafted 1 h – Oz 20 min). The rates for the two thermal
grafting with ozonation 20 min were (2.14 ± 0.29) × 10–5 mol g–1 and (9.49 ± 0.18)
× 10–5 mol g–1 after 1 and
3 h of polymerization at 45 °C, respectively. The amount of grafting
for the UV direct grafting (without surface activation) was (4.37
± 0.14) × 10–5 mol g–1. As for the grafted samples, we also dosed the grafting rate onto
the ungrafted PCL fiber scaffold. It shows a grafting rate of (1.56
± 0.34) × 10–6 mol g–1, which means more than a log difference compared to the lowest grafting
rate observed on grafted scaffolds. PolyNaSS, which is known to be
an ionic and hydrophilic polymer, when grafted on the PCL surface,
should lead to a decrease in contact angle compared to an ungrafted
PCL surface. We can observe, according to Figure 4, that the presence of polyNaSS grafted onto
the PCL fiber scaffold surface leads to contact angles lower than
that of the ungrafted PCL fiber scaffold. The ungrafted samples gave
a contact angle of 123 ± 2.5°. Thermal grafting 1 h –
Oz 20 min results in a contact angle value of 68.4 ± 0.9°,
and UV direct grafting 1 h gave a contact angle value of 34.3 ±
1.9°. For the thermal grafting 3 h – Oz 20 min and UV
grafting 1 h – Oz 20 min, the contact angle values were 0°,
which means that these two techniques gave superhydrophilic surfaces.
The higher amounts of grafted poly(NaSS) combined with the significantly
lower contact angle value (0°) observed for the thermal grafting
3 h and UV grafting 1 h (both with activation of 20 min ozonation)
compared to the thermal grafting 1 h – Oz 20 min and UV direct
grafting 1 h suggest a more homogeneous and complete covering of the
surface by the grafted polyNaSS. This is likely due to the creation,
owing to the ozonation step, of a surface layer of PCL (hydro)peroxides
increasing the available radicals leading to the initiation of NaSS
polymerization.

rates
and contact angles for ungrafted and grafted PCL fiber scaffolds (PFSc).

The FTIR spectra showed, in the grafted PCL
fiber scaffolds, the presence of specific peaks of the polyNaSS onto
the sample surfaces. Figure 5 shows the spectra of polyNaSS, ungrafted PCL fiber scaffold,
and four grafted PCL fiber scaffolds with polyNaSS (thermal grafting
1 h – Oz 20 min, thermal grafting 3 h – Oz 20 min, UV
grafting 1 h – Oz 20 min, and UV direct grafting 1 h) between
700 and 3000 cm–1. The aromatic ring and the symmetric
vibrations of the SO3– groups generated
a NaSS doublet (O=S=O) located at 1010 cm–1 (Table 2). The absorption
of the sulfonate was detected by the peak at 1130 cm–1, which is also associated with asymmetric vibrations (Table 2). Finally, a series of peaks
between 1498 and 1658 cm–1 are attributed to stretching
vibrations of bonds (C=C) of the benzene ring (Table 2).

As expected, the intensity
of the peaks is more pronounced on samples with a high amount of polyNaSS
grafting. In addition, by comparing FTIR analyses of the polyNaSS
grafted PCL fiber scaffolds to the FTIR spectra of polyNaSS-grafted
PCL films carried out in a recent work,38 we observed that the grafting on PCL fiber scaffolds makes it possible
to point out more characteristics peaks of the polyNaSS than in the
case of grafting on PCL films and this can be explained by the difference
in the architecture of the two surfaces since the available area on
these scaffolds is larger than for a flat surface. However, considering
that the PCL is an organic compound, it is difficult to be able to
locate the other peaks of polyNaSS among all those of the PCL. The
absence of polyNaSS-specific peaks was verified on ungrafted samples.

XPS analyses were performed on the different PCL fiber scaffolds
following the different treatments and NaSS different grafting conditions.
The assumed structure of PFSc and PFSc-polyNaSS grafted are presented
in Figure 6. Each condition
is made in triplicate.

(right) formula with the different carbon and oxygen atoms assigned
in XPS.

On the general spectra, Figure 7a, representing the untreated
PFSc, we note the expected presence of oxygen and carbon with peaks
centered at 531 and 285 eV, respectively. There is a slight difference
between the theoretical atomic percentages and the observed ones,
with more carbon than expected, probably due to some carbon contamination
due to XPS analyses. When looking at the high-resolution XPS spectra
for C1s and O1S regions, the raw data can be decomposed into four
contributions and two contributions, respectively. Regarding the C1s
region, the four contributions are assigned as ascribed in Figure 6, following the different
chemical environments of the carbon atoms. Quantitative analyses show
a good agreement between the theoretical distribution and the experimental
one (Table 3), with
only a small overexpression of the C1 at low binding energy
(BE), again due to carbon contamination. The O1s region show two contributions
assigned to both chemical forms of oxygen atoms present in the PFSc,
with a very good agreement for the observed atomic percentages compared
to the expected one (Figure 6 and Table 3).

Following the polyNaSS grafting under different conditions,
each survey spectrum shows the additional presence of Na1s at 1071
eV (accompanied with its corresponding Auger peak at 497 eV) and S2p
at 168 eV (together with the S2s peak at around 230 eV), suggesting
the successful grafting of polyNaSS onto these PFSc. The grafting
is also confirmed when looking at the O1s high-resolution XPS spectra
(Figure 7b–e),
with the appearance of a shoulder contribution at low binding energy,
531.6 eV, assigned to O3 oxygen atoms (Figure 6).

Table 3 lists the different atomic percentages of
region and contribution for these four grafted PFSc. There is a great
variability in the atomic percentages of S2p according to the different
PFSc series as well as on the different C/S and O/S ratios, as expected
following the colorimetric assay measurements. Looking at the experimental
results compared to the theoretical ones, several differences can
be noticed. First of all, all atomic concentrations of Na are very
low, and this can be explained by the rinsing conditions applied after
grafting procedures. When looking at the atomic percentages of S2p,
they are, most of the time, smaller than the expected values, except
for the UV 1 h – Oz 20 min grafted sample, which almost fits
the theoretical value. This is also observed for the contribution
of O3 oxygen atoms with much lower observed percentages
ranging from 1 to 7% as opposed to the 19.2 expected value (Table 3). These data clearly
suggest that the polyNaSS grafting efficiency is not the total and
it is also a function of the grafting conditions themselves.

Regarding the efficiency of polyNaSS grafting, it is clear that the
surface activation step by ozone treatment is necessary to optimize
the polyNaSS grafting return because, in the absence of this ozonation
step, the grafting rates is minimal (PFSc UV 1 h direct grafted).
Under identical conditions (thermal grafted 1 h – Oz 20 min),
grafting under UV irradiation is better than thermal grafting (grafting
UV 1 h – Oz 20 min vs thermal grafting 1 h – Oz 20 min,
respectively). Finally, more polyNaSS is grafted after 3 h as polymerization
time in thermal grafting than after 1 h (thermal grafting 3 h –
Oz 20 min vs thermal grafting 1 h – Oz 20 min, respectively).

Finally, the grafting rates according to the different conditions
were calculated in order to compare with the TB colorimetric measurements.
For this purpose, we have estimated the grafting rates by dividing
the theoretical ratios involving sulfur by the experimental ones;
these values are reported in Table 4. Figure 8 shows a comparison between the XPS obtained values and those obtained
by TB colorimetric assay measurements.

obtained values and those obtained by TB colorimetric assay measurements.

There is a relatively
similar trend between XPS values and chemical dosing by TB measurements,
except for the UV 1 h direct grafting where XPS percentages show a
lower grafting rate than thermal grafting 1 h – Oz 20 min,
but this is probably due to the porous morphology of the PFSc where
polyNaSS is grafted not only on the surface fibers but also on the
fibers located deep in the PFSc, making these deeply grafted molecules
accessible by TB chemical assay measurement but not by XPS analyses.
The XPS results for the different grafted PFSc surfaces were consistent
with the TB, contact anglem and FTIR-ATR results.

Effect of polyNaSS Grafting Processes on PCL Thermal
Properties
Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),
possible changes in PCL intrinsic properties (melting temperature
and crystallinity degree) have been investigated. We have reproduced
the four different processes of the grafting (ozonation, heating at
45 °C, and UV irradiation) without introducing the NaSS monomer
to simulate the grafting steps in order to study the effect of these
steps on the thermal properties of PCL independently of the presence
of polyNaSS grafting itself. The thermal properties (melting temperature
and crystallinity degree) of the untreated and treated PCL fiber scaffolds
analyzed are listed in Table 5.

Table 5 Thermal Properties of Untreated and Treated PCL Fiber
Scaffolds

ozonated 20 min + UV irradiated 1 h	61 ± 0.7	49.2	
UV irradiated 1 h	60 ± 0.2	49.5	
Untreated PFSc showed a melting temperature (Tm) of 58 °C and crystallinity degree (Xc) of 49.7% (Table 5), which is consistent with the literature.18 It was found that the grafting steps whether
this is by ozonation, heating, or UV irradiation slightly increased
the melting temperature. On the other hand, no significant variations
in crystallinity degree occurred after the different treatments, whatever
the grafting method used (thermal or UV) (Table 5). It has already been shown that the polyNaSS
thermal grafting onto PCL film surfaces does not alter the thermal
properties of PCL;18 however, these results
remain to be confirmed with further studies on all PCL properties
after the grafting process.

Evaluation
of the Cell Response
Cytocompatibility, including the absence
of toxicity and the good cell integration, is the key requirement
for the biocompatibility of a biomaterial. The principal objective
of the cell response experiments was to observe the possible differences
of cell behavior on four PCL scaffolds functionalized by different
techniques of grafting and exhibiting different degrees of surface
hydrophilicity and compare them to each other as well as an ungrafted
PCL scaffold. Fibroblast L929 cells was used to evaluate the biological
response onto the PCL scaffold surfaces to appreciate the cytotoxicity,
adhesion, spreading, and cell morphology.

Cytotoxicity Evaluation
MTT assay was performed as a first
step of the evaluation of the cytocompatibility of the polyNaSS-grafted
scaffolds (Figure 9). Cells cultured on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) plates were
used as a reference. The ungrafted PCL scaffold exhibited 88.3 ±
4.8% cell viability; this result was expected since the PCL is a known
cytocompatible polymer. PolyNaSS-grafted PCL scaffolds, for their
part, showed a cell viability of >90%. The thermal grafted 3 h
– Oz 20 min and UV grafted 1 h – Oz 20 min scaffolds
showed the higher percentage of viability (≈93%), and the thermal
grafted 1 h – Oz 20 min showed the least percentage of viable
cells (91.5 ± 2.6%) among the functionalized scaffolds (Figure 9).

Figure 9 Percentage

and different polyNaSS-grafted PCL scaffolds.

Likewise,
cell viability values found for the different grafted scaffolds are
quite similar; therefore, we cannot conclude that there is a difference
in cell viability among the different grafted scaffolds despite the
differences in polyNaSS grafting rates and surface hydrophilicity.
MTT assay measurements proved the noncytotoxic nature of the polyNaSS
grafting and showed instead that the polyNaSS grafting onto PCL scaffolds
slightly improves the cell viability even for a short direct contact
time (48 h) in the conditions tested here.

Cell Adhesion (Spreading and Morphology)
The adhesion,
spreading, and morphology of L929 fibroblast cells onto ungrafted
PCL scaffold and grafted PCL scaffold (thermal grafted 1 h –
Oz 20 min, thermal grafted 3 h – Oz 20 min, UV grafted 1 h
– Oz 20 min, and UV direct grafted 1 h) surfaces was evaluated
after 4 and 7 days of culture by analyzing the SEM micrographs of
scaffolds on which the cells were fixed for 30 min at 4 °C in
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Figures 10 and Figures 11). From the micrographs, we can observe that the cells had
attached to the scaffold network at the two time points on both the
ungrafted and grafted scaffolds. At day 4 (Figure 10), for the ungrafted PCL scaffold (contact
angle = 123°), the cells were not well spread in comparison to
the thermal grafted 1 h – Oz 20 min (contact angle = 68.4 ±
0.9°) and UV direct grafted 1 h (contact angle = 34.3 ±
1.9°) scaffolds where the cells were polygonal in shape with
a well spreading and cling to the surrounding fibers at different
points with the formation at some places of cytoplasmic protrusions
to attach the cell to a remote fiber. The analyses of micrographs
for the thermal grafted 3 h – Oz 20 min and UV grafted 1 h
– Oz 20 min scaffolds, which present a contact angle of 0°,
showed that the cells took a rounded shape and was not well spread
onto the fibers (shape can be clearly observed at magnifications with
100 and 300 μm scale). In addition, on these two grafting conditions,
the cells tend to individualize without extending their cytoplasm
and thus were attached to the fibers on fewer points than for the
grafted scaffolds exhibiting a contact angle greater than 0°.

Figure 10 SEM micrographs
at different
magnifications of L929 fibroblast cells attached and spread onto the
ungrafted PCL fiber scaffold and polyNaSS-grafted PCL fiber scaffolds
taken at day 4 and contact angle values of each condition.

Figure 11 SEM micrographs
at different magnifications of L929 fibroblast cells attached and
spread onto ungrafted PCL scaffold and polyNaSS-grafted PCL scaffolds
taken at day 7 and contact angle values of each condition.

By day 7 (Figure 11), the adherent cells have become more elongated than for the day
4 time point, and this can be explained by the fact that the cells
are on scaffolds that present a three-dimensional-like structure formed
by the different fiber layers superimposed on each other; therefore,
the cells have taken the time to adapt to this structure quite different
from a flat surface. While observing in detail the micrographs taken
at day 7 (Figure 11), the first thing that can be noted is that the cells are less spread
on ungrafted scaffolds compared to grafted scaffolds.

We can
also observe that the cells tend to stay mostly on the surface of
the ungrafted scaffold, while for the grafted scaffolds that present
hydrophilic surfaces, the cells were integrated into the scaffold
network and cling to fibers located on planes other than the surface.
However, when grafted scaffolds are compared to each other and given
the differences in the degree of hydrophilicity of the surface, we
observed that the cells cultured on superhydrophilic surfaces with
a contact angle of 0 ° (thermal grafted 3 h – Oz 20 min
and UV grafted 1 h – Oz 20 min) were less spread and tend to
become individualized, revealing uncovered scaffold spaces between
cells.

On the thermal 1 h – Oz 20 min and UV direct 1
h grafted scaffolds (hydrophilic surfaces) with contact angles of
68.4 ± 0.9° and 34.3 ± 1.9°, respectively, the
cells are well elongated with extensions in all directions while clinging
to the fibers. They are well spread compared to cells cultured for
the same time point on superhydrophilic scaffolds. Moreover, by elongating
and proliferating, the cells assemble and unite to form what looks
like a cellular tissue that can be clearly observed at magnifications
with 300 μm scale. Therefore, the cells covered a large part
of the scaffold surface for these two conditions. These outcomes at
day 7 confirm those observed above at day 4.

Scaffold Surface Coverage/Distribution by Cells
To
confirm the trends revealed in the above results, cell surface coverage
and distribution was appreciated by analyzing the SEM micrographs
taken at different culture time points: 2, 4, 7, and 10 days. Measurements
of the percentage of the surface scaffold covered by cells in relation
to the total scaffold surfaces were recorded using ImageJ software.
Results of distribution/coverage of cells are shown in Figure 12. As can be seen, cell coverage
data over 2 days showed that the cells on both the grafted and ungrafted
PCL scaffold surfaces supported steady proliferation to equivalent
levels, with a slight increase observed on the various grafted scaffolds,
which are consistent with the results of cytotoxicity at day 2 (Figure 12.). Indeed, since
cell viability is slightly higher for the different grafted samples,
the surface coverage by the cells must also be slightly higher compared
to ungrafted scaffolds. Beyond day 2, the ungrafted PCL scaffolds
exhibited less cell coverage than grafted scaffolds, this was not
unexpected since the grafted scaffolds present a hydrophilic surface,
which is known to be most suitable to support cell proliferation.
Although the grafted scaffolds showed better cell coverage than ungrafted
scaffolds, when compared to each other and given the substantial difference
of contact angle values, we noted that scaffolds with superhydrophilic
surfaces (thermal grafted 3 h – Oz 20 min “CA = 0°”
and UV grafted 1 h – Oz 20 min “CA = 0°”)
showed, at all time points, less cell coverage than scaffolds with
a hydrophilic surface (thermal grafted 1 h – Oz 20 min “CA
= 68.4°” and UV direct grafted “CA = 34.3°”)
on days 4, 7, and 10. Finally, we observed, among all the grafted
scaffolds, that the UV direct grafted 1 h scaffold presented slightly
higher cell coverage than the others.

Figure 12 Percentage
of scaffold surface covered by L929 fibroblast cells at different
time points (2, 4, 7, and 10 days).

These outcomes were consistent
with expectations based on data from the cell adhesion and morphology
conducted over 7 days with time points at 4 and 7 days and confirm
that, as for the spreading and morphology, the grafted scaffolds with
hydrophilic surfaces presented better spread cells, that is, more
coverage/distribution on the scaffold surfaces since a well spreading
cell will cover more surface area and the more the cells are spread
the larger the area they cover on the scaffold.

To interpret
these results and to be able to explain the observed effects, concerning
the adhesion, spreading, and the percentage of cell coverage, we can
refer to the work of Bacakova et al.40 It
was revealed that the adhesion and growth of cells is optimum on materials
with moderate wettability because, on these surfaces, the adhesion-mediating
proteins are adsorbed in an almost physiological conformation and
well recognized by the cell adhesion receptors. Specifically, it has
been demonstrated that the cells adhered in higher numbers to more
hydrophilic materials than hydrophobic material surfaces and were
spread over a larger area. This phenomenon can be explained by the
fact that the spatial conformation of the adsorbed molecules that
mediate cell adhesion plays a primordial role. Furthermore, on hydrophilic
surfaces, these molecules are adsorbed in a more flexible form, which
allows them to be reorganized by the cells and thus provides access
for cell adhesion receptors to the adhesion motifs on these molecules.
However, it has been also demonstrated that a high rate of adsorbed
protein could even be disadvantageous for cell adhesion due to denaturing
of the proteins, and this finding is particularly important in the
case of our study since we have compared the effect of not only hydrophobic
and hydrophilic surfaces but also superhydrophilic surfaces, which
presented a contact angle of 0°. In addition, Keselowsky et al.41 reported that an optimal cell adhesion occurs
only to moderately hydrophilic surfaces. They demonstrated that, on
highly hydrophilic surfaces, especially on superhydrophilic surfaces
(contact angle of <2°), cell attachment and spreading are
limited or completely disabled. This observation can explain why on
polyNaSS-grafted scaffolds exhibiting a contact angle of 0° (thermal
grafted 3 h – Oz 20 min and UV grafted 1 h – Oz 20 min),
the cells were less spread and adhered to the scaffold fibers with
a lower number of adhesion sites. This phenomenon is visible on the
micrographs taken for these superhydrophilic surfaces, especially
the UV grafted 60 min – Oz 20 min scaffold at day 4 (Figure 10). Elsewhere, previous
studies carried out in our laboratory proved that the modulation of
the cell behavior is as much influenced by the chemical composition
of the exposed surface to binding proteins and cells as by the hydrophilic
properties of the surface.18,21 Moreover, the sulfonate
groups of the polyNaSS grafting can stimulate the cell adhesion and
activate cell spreading as a result of the ability of the sulfonate
groups to permit the modulation of the adsorption of adhesive proteins
and the modulation of their conformation. As it has been shown by
El Khadali et al.22 on polyNaSS-grafted
biomaterial surfaces, the most important parameter is the ratio and
distribution of the ionic groups in the active sites. In addition,
Rohman et al.18 have reported that the
grafted polyNaSS due to its negative charge provided by the location
of sulfonate functions on the polyNaSS aromatic ring contributes to
a better cell response for fibroblasts. It has been demonstrated that,
even if the study was carried out on another PCL surface (PCL films),
which differs therefrom of a flat surface compared to the PCL fiber
scaffold surface, which presents a complex architecture formed by
the fiber network, on a low sulfonated surface, that is, with a moderate
grafting rate (and automatically a moderated hydrophilic surface character),
the spreading of cells is enhanced. A hypothesis have been formulated
that it is not necessary to develop PCL surfaces grafted with a high
polyNaSS grafting rate in order to promote the cell response.

Outcomes of this study confirmed the results obtained previously
concerning the improvement of the cell response obtained on polyNaSS
grafted surfaces and demonstrate the positive effect of the grafting
of polyNaSS on the fibroblastic response even on a complex architecture
surface such as a biodegradable scaffold formed by a network of electrospun
fibers. Moreover, we have demonstrated that a moderated grafting rate
can provide suitable effects on the cell behavior.

Conclusions
The purpose of this research
article was to demonstrate the feasibility of covalent grafting, under
UV irradiation, a bioactive polymer onto the electrospun PCL fiber
scaffold (PFSc) designed for tissue engineering applications and highlight
the influence of this bioactive polyNaSS polymer on the biological
response once it is grafted onto the scaffold surface.

Analyses
of the PCL fiber scaffold morphology show continuous stretch of bead-free
PCL fibers with uniform large pores.

The differences between
four covalent “grafting from” methods are compared in
terms of surface functionalization, hydrophilicity, and their effect
on the in vitro biological response of fibroblasts.

The “grafting
from” with surface activation gives dense and homogeneous polyNaSS
grafted scaffold surfaces for both thermal (3 h) and UV initiation
processes resulting in superhydrophilic surfaces. Thermal grafting
1 h with surface activation and UV direct grafting give moderated
polyNaSS grafted resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. Thermal analyses
demonstrated that the grafting processes did not alter the PCL intrinsic
properties whatever the grafting method used.

The fibroblast
biological response varied with the grafting rate and surface hydrophilicity.

Assays using L929 fibroblast cells showed no evidence of cytotoxicity
when cells were in direct contact with any of the polyNaSS-grafted
PFSc surfaces or the ungrafted PFSc control. It was found that better
adhesion, enhanced spreading, and higher scaffold surface coverage
of the fibroblast cells were shown when seeded onto the moderated
grafted PCL fiber scaffolds.

The bioactive polyNaSS polymer grafted effectively modulates the
fibroblast cell response when it is present in moderate amounts on
PFSc surfaces.

Outcomes highlighted that the UV direct “grafting
from” method, with a very easy process, allowing to moderate
the amount of sulfonate groups and the surface hydrophilicity presents
a considerable interest to develop bioactive and biodegradable PCL
fiber scaffolds, which can be used in tissue engineering applications.

To conclude, based on the results obtained in this work, the bioactive
and biodegradable PCL fiber scaffold grafted with polyNaSS could be
considered in the next generation of bioactive synthetic scaffolds.
The possible applications of these bioactive scaffolds, that is, covalently
grafted with polyNaSS, which we are focusing on, are periodontal regeneration,
spina bifida healing, and cartilage regeneration. For the last one,
some experiments have started and show that the differentiation phenotype
of mesenchymal cells toward chondrocytes is enhanced by the bioactive
electrospun PCL fiber scaffolds. Otherwise, further studies with other
cell types had to be conducted in order to accurately capture the
different application fields of these potential scaffolds.

Experimental Section
Materials
All chemical products were used as received unless
otherwise noted and obtained from commercial suppliers. Polycaprolactone
(PCL) granules (Mn = 8 × 104 g mol–1) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Solvents
used for the preparation of electrospinning polymer solutions were
obtained from Fisher Scientific for chloroform and from Carl Roth
for dimethylformamide. Distilled water was obtained from a Millipore
Milli-Q Plus water purification system equipped with a 0.22 μm
filter (resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C). Sodium styrene
sulfonate (NaSS; Sigma) used for the grafting process was purified
by recrystallization in a mixture of water/ethanol (Carlo Erba) (10:
90 v/v).26,27,33,38 The purified NaSS was then dried under atmospheric
pressure at 50 °C overnight and then stored at 4 °C. Fibroblast
L929 cell line (mouse C3H/An adipose connective tissue) was purchased
from the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC
85011425).

Electrospun PCL Fiber Scaffold
(PFSc) Preparation
PCL was electrospun using a homemade electrospinning
device, schematically presented in Figure 1. PCL was first dissolved in a mixture of
chloroform and dimethylformamide (90/10 v/v) to prepare a 15% w/v
solution and stirred overnight before use. The polymer solution was
then loaded into a 10 mL glass syringe fitted with a 20 G (0.9 mm)
blunt-tipped needle. The solution was continuously ejected using a
syringe pump at a rate of 2 mL h–1. The voltage
used for electrospinning was 9 kV, and the distance between the needle
and the collector was 20 cm. The deposition time was 2 h for all experiments.
PCL electrospun fiber scaffolds were dried overnight at room temperature
to remove the solvent, and small disks of 16 mm ± 0.5 mm in diameter
were cut after complete drying as experiment samples.

Scaffold Characterization
The fiber diameter
and the morphology of the scaffold were characterized using a Hitachi
TM3000 SEM. The distribution of fiber size and average fiber diameter
was determined from analyzing a minimum of 50 fibers from the scaffold
SEM images. The average pore size was determined by measuring a diameter
of a virtual sphere between fibers in the same plan or in the nearly
plan.42 All scaffold characterization measures
were done using Image J software.

“Grafting from” of polyNaSS onto Electrospun PCL Fiber
Scaffold Disks
Grafting with Surface
Activation
For the polyNaSS grafting process after a surface
activation, the first step was to suspend the samples at room temperature
(30 °C) under stirring in distilled water (dH2O).
With a pressure of 0.5 bar and an oxygen flow rate of 0.6 L min–1, an ozone generator BMT 802 N (ACW) allows the generation
of ozone. This step creates (hydro)peroxide functions onto the PCL
surface. After an ozonation step, the PCL fiber scaffold disks were
transferred into a round-bottom flask containing a 0.7 M degassed
aqueous solution of NaSS. The grafting was performed as follows:1. Thermal grafting: To allow the graft
polymerization of NaSS, the system was maintained at 45 °C for
1 or 3 h.

2. UV grafting:
The activated PCL fiber scaffold disks transferred into the round-bottom
flask were irradiated with UV light (365 nm with Lotoriel UV lamp)
for 1 h at room temperature under stirring.



UV Direct Grafting without Surface
Activation
In this grafting process, the samples were directly
immersed into a round-bottom flask containing a 0.7 M degassed aqueous
solution of NaSS and irradiated with UV light at room temperature
under stirring. The UV device used was a Lotoriel lamp from Lot Quantum
Design.38 After the polymerization process
and before characterization, the grafted surfaces were rinsed for
48 h with dH2O and dried overnight at 37 °C.

Surface Characterization
The
polyNaSS grafting rate onto PCL fiber scaffold surfaces was first
determined using the toluidine blue (TB) colorimetric method. Then,
it was characterized by water contact angle measurement (WCA), Fourier
transform infrared spectra recorded in attenuated total reflection
mode (ATR-FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS).

Toluidine Blue Colorimetric
Method
In order to dose the polyNaSS grafting rate, TB assay
(Carl Roth) was carried out onto three PCL fiber scaffold disks for
each grafting. The polyNaSS-grafted disks were immersed in a TB solution
(5 × 10–4 M) at 30 °C for 6 h to allow
complexation of TB with the anionic groups of the grafted polymers
on surfaces. It is assumed that 1 mol of toluidine blue forms a complex
with 1 mol of sulfonate group.43 After
incubation, the samples were washed in NaOH aqueous solution (1 ×
10–3 M) for 5 min to remove the noncomplexed TB
molecules. Decomplexation of TB was done by soaking the samples in
a 10 mL mixture of acetic acid/dH2O (50/50 v/v; Fisher)
for 24 h at room temperature. The concentration of decomplexed TB
was measured by visible spectroscopy at 633 nm using a Perkin Elmer
Lambda 25 spectrometer. Ungrafted PCL films were used as controls
and found to generate low unspecific TB complexation, which was further
subtracted. Three films were used per analysis. Ungrafted PCL fiber
scaffold disks were used as controls and found not to react with the
TB solution.

Water Contact Angle
Measurements
To measure the static water contact angles onto
the different PCL fiber scaffold surfaces, we used a DSA10 contact
angle measuring system from KRUSS GmbH. To determine the contact angles,
a droplet of water was suspended from the tip of a microliter syringe
supported above the sample stage. The image of the droplet was captured,
and the contact angle of dH2O (2 μL) on the surface
was recorded 10 s after contact using DSA drop shape analysis software
from KRUSS. Three measurements were taken and averaged.

ATR-FTIR Analyses
The Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra, recorded in an attenuated total reflection
(ATR), were obtained using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum Two Spectrometer.
A diamond crystal (4000–500 cm–1) with a
resolution of 4 cm–1 was applied. The PCL fiber
scaffold disks were uniformly pressed against the crystal, and for
each surface, 128 scans were acquired.

SEM Analyses
Using a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi
TM3000), we analyzed the surface microtopography of the grafted PCL
fiber scaffold disks (without sample preparation).

X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Analyses
XPS analyses were performed using an Omicron Argus spectrometer
(Taunusstein, Germany) equipped with a monochromated Al Kα radiation
source (hν = 1486.6 eV) working at an electron
beam power of 300 W. Photoelectrons emission was analyzed at a takeoff
angle of 90°; the analyses were carried out under ultrahigh vacuum
conditions (≤10–10 Torr) after introduction
via a load-lock system into the main chamber. Spectra were obtained
by setting up a 100 eV pass energy for the survey spectrum, and a
pass energy of 20 eV was chosen for the high-resolution regions. Binding
energies were calibrated against the C1s binding energy of aliphatic
carbon atoms at 284.8 eV. Element peak intensities were corrected
by Scofield factors.44 Casa XPS v.2.3.15
software (Casa Software Ltd., UK) was utilized to fit the spectra,
and Gaussian/Lorentzian ratio was applied (ratio = 70/30).

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed
using a DSC 8000 calorimeter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, USA). Measurements
were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. PCL samples were scanned
once from −80 to 100 °C at a heating and rate of 10 °C/min.
Enthalpy (ΔHm) and temperature of
melting (Tm) were calculated from the
first and only scan using a Pyris software platform: the melting temperature
was taken at the maximum of the peak, and the melting enthalpy was
calculated as the melting peak area surface. The degree of crystallinity
(Xc) was calculated using eq 1: 1  where ΔHm0 stands for the melting enthalpy of 100% crystalline
PCL (ΔHm0 = 135 J g–1).45 For each scaffold condition, three samples were
analyzed.

Biological Assays
PCL Scaffold Surfaces Preparation
Before the biological assays, ungrafted and grafted PCL fiber scaffold
surfaces were washed consecutively under stirring at room temperature
as follows: with saline aqueous solution 1.5 M sodium chloride (NaCl;
Fisher), with saline aqueous solution 0.15 M NaCl, with pure water,
and with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (Gibco). Each step
lasts 3 h and has been repeated three times. The PCL fiber scaffolds
were finally air-dried and sterilized by exposure to ultraviolet light
for 15 min on each side.

Cell Seeding
onto PCL Fiber Scaffold
Fibroblast L929 cells were seeded
onto sterilized PCL fiber scaffolds, maintained on the bottom of individual
wells of 24-well TCPS using polypropylene inserts at a density of
5 × 104 cells/well, and allowed to adhere and spread.
Analysis of cell association with the PCL fiber scaffolds was assessed
using the following methods.

Cell
Viability
Cell viability was evaluated using MTT assay.46 We used a standard cell line toxicity test to
appreciate the cell viability. In this assay, we maintained a mouse
fibroblast cell line L929 in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% FBS, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified
air containing 5% CO2. The mitochondrial dehydrogenases
of viable cells cleave the yellow (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) (MTT, Sigma) substrate to produce purple formazan crystals.
After 48 h incubation of cells within the scaffolds, 50 μL of
a freshly prepared MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to each well and
incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Cell media was then discarded, and
0.5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide was used to dissolve the formazan crystals.
As a control, we used cells treated with MTT without scaffold. The
absorbance was measured at 570 nm47 using
a microplate reader (ELx800, BioTek). Mitochondrial activity as an
indicator of cell viability was calculated as the absorbance ratio
between cells cultured within scaffolds and nontreated cells (blank).

Cell Morphology
The morphology
of L929 fibroblasts onto the control PCL fiber scaffold and polyNaSS-grafted
PCL fiber scaffolds was studied at 2 and 7 days (n = 2 for each condition at each time point). In this assay, the ungrafted
or polyNaSS-grafted PCL fiber scaffold disks are placed on the bottom
of individual wells of 24-well TCPS plate and maintained using Teflon
inserts. Cells were seeded onto samples at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and allowed to adhere and spread to two time points
(2 and 7 days). After these time periods, the medium was removed,
and samples were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered serum (PBS)
then fixed for 30 min at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS,
washed twice with PBS, and finally once with ultrapure water for 5
min. The samples were stored at 4 °C overnight before observation.
Cell morphology and spreading was evaluated from the SEM images using
SEM (Hitachi TM3000).

Scaffold Surface
Coverage/Distribution by Cells
Scaffold surface coverage
by cells was evaluated by analyzing the SEM micrographs of scaffold
surfaces seeded by L929 fibroblast cells. Cell seeding and fixation
was performed according to the same protocol as the cell morphology
study. In this assay, the cells were cultured onto scaffolds for time
points: 2, 4, 7, and 10 days. From the SEM micrographs taken at different
time points, the calculation of the percentage of the surface scaffold
covered by cells in relation to the total scaffold surface was recorded
using ImageJ software (n = 3 for each condition at
each time point).
