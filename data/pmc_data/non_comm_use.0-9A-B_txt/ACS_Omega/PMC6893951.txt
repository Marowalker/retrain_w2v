Aptamers are well-established biorecognition molecules
used in
a wide variety of applications for the detection of their respective
targets. However, individual SELEX processes typically performed for
the identification of aptamers for each target can be quite time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and costly. An alternative strategy is proposed herein
for the simultaneous identification of different aptamers binding
distinct but structurally similar targets in one single selection.
This one-pot SELEX approach, using the steroids estradiol, progesterone,
and testosterone as model targets, was achieved by combining the benefits
of counter-SELEX with the power of next-generation sequencing and
bioinformatics analysis. The pools from the last stage of the selection
were compared in order to discover sequences with preferential abundance
in only one of the pools. This led to the identification of aptamer
candidates with potential specificity to a single steroid target.
Binding studies demonstrated the high affinity of each selected aptamer
for its respective target, and low nanomolar range dissociation constants
calculated were similar to those previously reported for steroid-binding
aptamers selected using traditional SELEX approaches. Finally, the
selected aptamers were exploited in microtiter plate assays, achieving
nanomolar limits of detection, while the specificity of these aptamers
was also demonstrated. Overall, the one-pot SELEX strategy led to
the discovery of aptamers for three different steroid targets in one
single selection without compromising their affinity or specificity,
demonstrating the power of this approach of aptamer discovery for
the simultaneous selection of aptamers against multiple targets.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In almost 30 years since
their initial report,1,2 aptamers
selected through the SELEX process have been established as reliable
recognition molecules for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.
They have been proposed as viable antibody replacements because of
their numerous attractive properties,3,4 including (i)
the possibility to bind virtually any kind of target, (ii) high affinity
and specificity, (iii) reproducible chemical synthesis, (iv) stability
at a variety of environmental conditions, (v) reversible denaturation,
(vi) in vitro selection, (vii) possibility of site-directed modification,
and (viii) potential tuning of kinetic parameters.

The classic
SELEX process exploited for aptamer selection involves
the initial use of a highly diverse oligonucleotide library (1014 to 1016 variants) for performing iterative rounds
of target binding, partitioning of bound sequences, and subsequent
amplification for following rounds. Different variants of this process
have been proposed over the years to accommodate specific targets
and applications, as has been extensively reviewed.5−7 Negative SELEX
was introduced to eliminate sequences with affinity to the matrix
used for target immobilization,2 while
counter-SELEX was incorporated to remove sequences with affinity to
structurally similar or potentially interfering molecules.8 Other variants have been developed to shorten
the selection process (e.g., FluMag-SELEX,9 capillary electrophoresis,10 and microfluidic
SELEX11) or to enable the selection of
aptamers to different types of targets (e.g., cell SELEX,12 capture-SELEX,13 and
graphene oxide SELEX14) or with desired
properties (e.g., Photo SELEX15). The idea
of using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify aptamer candidates
instead of the classic cloning-sequencing approach was first introduced
by Hoon et al.16 Since then NGS has not
only enabled the analysis of thousands of sequences instead of just
a hundred at best but it has also paved the way to gain further insights
into the selection process. The realization of massive parallel sequencing
of multiple rounds has facilitated the monitoring of the abundance
and persistence of certain sequences throughout SELEX, and new bioinformatics
approaches have consequently been developed to enable the analysis
of the vast data sets obtained from NGS.17,18

Despite the huge advances made in the aptamer selection process,
a new selection still has to be performed for each new target. In
an effort to bypass this limitation, a one-pot SELEX strategy is proposed
in this work, as depicted in Figure 1. It relies on the use of counter-SELEX, NGS, and bioinformatics
analysis in order to simultaneously identify aptamers for three distinct
but structurally similar targets in one single selection. The selection
was performed by successive incubations of the ssDNA sub-libraries
with each of the targets, followed by NGS of the pools from the last
stage of the selection and monitoring of the sequence variability
and abundance in each pool to identify unique persistent sequences.
It was hypothesized that the preferential abundance of a sequence
in only one pool originating from a single target would be related
to its specificity for the desired target and absence of cross-reactivity
with the other two targets used in the same selection process. Even
though counter-SELEX is a common approach for removing sequences binding
to undesired molecules and NGS has been used before for aptamer discovery,
the combination of the two with the bioinformatics analysis proposed
herein has not been reported before. The model targets used to validate
this hypothesis were the steroids estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone.
Steroids belong to a family of hormones involved in many physiological
processes and are used as biomarkers in many fields, including reproductive
health,19,20 cancer diagnostics21 as well as in doping control,22 and the
detection of environmental pollutants.23,24 Steroid-binding
aptamers have already been reported, with the majority of these reports
targeting estradiol, and their binding properties were evaluated in
a previous work.25 Of the various reported
estradiol aptamers, those developed by Kim et al.26 and Alsager et al.27 have been
widely adopted in various applications.28−31 In the case of progesterone,
only one aptamer has been reported to date,32 which has been exploited33,34 despite the fact that
it cross reacts with other steroids.33−35 Finally, testosterone-binding
aptamers have been reported36 but to date,
no application of this aptamer has been reported. The structural similarities
between steroids are quite high thus obtaining aptamers with high
specificity for these small molecules is a challenging task. In this
work, we establish the suitability of the proposed one-pot SELEX approach
to identify multiple specific aptamers in one selection process. The
binding properties of the identified aptamers were characterized,
and the selected aptamers were exploited in microtiter plate assays
for the individual detection of each of estradiol, progesterone, and
testosterone. Finally, their performance was compared to previously
reported aptamers to further highlight the benefits of the proposed
strategy.

targets.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Selection Strategy
The objectives
of the selection process employed were twofold: (1) perform one single
selection and identify multiple aptamers binding to distinct but structurally
similar targets and (2) achieve specificity for each desired target
with no cross-reactivity with the other non-target molecules. To demonstrate
the proposed one-pot SELEX approach for selection of aptamers against
several targets, the steroids estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone
were chosen as models because of their high structural similarities
(see structures in Figure S1, Supporting Information) and their simultaneous occurrence in biological samples, where
any cross-reactivity would impede their reliable quantification. To
promote specific aptamer selection, counter-SELEX is typically employed
using potentially interfering molecules, separately or in combination.
In this work, up to four separate incubations were performed sequentially
per round, each utilizing different types of modified magnetic beads:
(a) control beads (with their reactive groups blocked with sulfo-NHS
acetate) to exclude sequences with affinity for the matrix of the
beads alone, (b) progesterone, (c) testosterone, and (d) estradiol-modified
beads to select sequences with affinity for each of these steroids.
The beads used in each round are detailed in Table S1 (Supporting Information), and a schematic representation
of the selection is illustrated in Figure 1. The selection was performed at different
stages, starting with the estradiol beads and gradually incorporating
the other steroid beads in the selection according to Figure S3 (Supporting Information). During the last stage
(rounds 11–15), the ssDNA library was initially incubated with
the control beads and the supernatant from this incubation, containing
unbound sequences, was then sequentially incubated with the progesterone,
testosterone, and estradiol beads in three separate incubation steps,
using the specific conditions for each round (Table S1 and Figure
S3, Supporting Information). To simplify
the selection, minimize the duration and also lower the costs, only
the estradiol-binding pool from each round was ultimately used for
the preparation of ssDNA for the following round. Because of the high
structural similarities between the three targets, cross-reactive
sequences in all pools were expected. A preliminary evaluation of
the selection process up to round 11 indeed confirmed this. The ssDNA
pool prepared from the estradiol beads (last incubation step in each
round) appeared to bind to all three steroid-bead types (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

2.2 Identification of Aptamer Candidates
To identify sequences from the last round of selection with the desired
specificity to each target, several points were considered: (i) the
three targets share very high structural similarities (Figure S1, Supporting Information); therefore, complete
elimination of cross-reacting sequences from the pools was considered
unlikely; (ii) each sub-library was prepared from the DNA bound on
the estradiol beads at the end of each round; therefore, it was expected
that the majority of binders to the other two targets progesterone
and testosterone were removed from the selection; (iii) comparison
of the composition of the data sets obtained from the last round for
each target (E2–R15, P4–R15, and T–R15) was expected
to be useful in identifying sequences with preferential abundance
in only one of the target pools; (iv) the pools from round 15 binding
to the progesterone and testosterone beads would presumably contain
persistent, generic steroid binders as well as some unique sequences
binding specifically to each steroid target.

As already mentioned
above, the pool from round 11 contained sequences binding to all three
targets, even though preferential binding to estradiol was observed
(Figure S4, Supporting Information). This
was expected considering that only the estradiol-binding pool was
used for the preparation of the sub-library for each succeeding selection
round. Also, the ssDNA pool used for the last selection round (round
15) contained very few remaining sequences binding to the progesterone
and testosterone beads compared to the estradiol beads [apta-PCR affinity
assay (APAA) assay, data not shown].

The bioinformatics analysis
aiming at discovering specific binders
to each steroid target was initiated by performing a general statistics
analysis of the raw data. This can be found in the Supporting Information (Table S2). With the exception of round
11 of the estradiol selection (E2–R11) that gave a very low
read number (268), which can be attributed to sample preparation issues,
all the other pools sequenced gave an average of 100 000 reads
thus enabling in-depth analysis of sequence variability and representation.
The seven sequences with highest number of copies (most over-represented
sequences based on 100% sequence identity) in pools E2–R11
and E2–R13 were designated as Seq.1–Seq.7 and were initially
analyzed. Their ranking and high abundance in each of the pools sequenced
suggested possible binding to all three steroid targets (Table S3, Supporting Information). This was confirmed
experimentally with an APAA which verified their cross-reactivity
with all three steroids tested (Figure S5, Supporting Information). This finding reinforces the widespread belief
that the most abundant sequences are not necessarily the best binders,
in terms of binding affinity and/or specificity. In search of specific
sequences in silico, the pools from round 15 for the three steroids
were compared in order to identify sequences with preferential abundance
in only one of them as detailed in the Supporting Information. This analysis led to the identification of the
sequences E1–E30, P1–P18, and T1–T7 for estradiol,
progesterone, and testosterone, respectively. Their sequences can
be found in Tables S4–S6 (Supporting Information) and information regarding ranking and abundance in Table S7 (Supporting Information). Multiple sequence alignment
of all these sequences let to the identification of sequence families
as shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). Based on the information of abundance and sequence families, a
total of six aptamer sequences were chosen for further characterization.
These were E11, E26, and E28 for estradiol, P5 and P6 for progesterone,
and T6 for testosterone. Their abundance in the different target pools
from round 15 can be seen in Figure 2, while their sequences and predicted structures are
found in Table S8 and Figure S7 (Supporting Information). These sequences were ultimately chosen for experimental evaluation.

pools sequenced. E2, P4, and T correspond to the steroids estradiol,

2.3 Screening of the Aptamer Candidates
The characterization of the individual aptamer candidates was performed
with the aim of determining their affinity for their respective target
and ultimately choosing the most appropriate candidate(s) for assay
development and cross-reactivity studies. It is essential to study
the binding properties of small molecule binding aptamers with multiple
techniques in order to confirm their affinity and also exclude the
effect and/or participation of the matrix used for target immobilization
to the binding event. It is also critical to corroborate their performance
in application-specific conditions because their performance in one
application does not guarantee their functionality in another one.
To this end, the affinity dissociation constants (KD) of the selected aptamer candidates were evaluated using
three independent methods. Initially, the APAA was used. The utility
of this assay for monitoring aptamer-small molecule interactions has
already been demonstrated.25,36 The conditions employed
for this assay mimic the ones used during the selection process, where
the steroid targets are immobilized on magnetic beads and the binding
of unmodified aptamers is detected after PCR amplification and gel
electrophoresis. The beads used for target immobilization were different
compared to the ones used during the selection, in size and binding
capacity. This was done deliberately to demonstrate the absence of
matrix participation in the binding event. As can be seen in Table 1 and Figure S8a (Supporting Information), all aptamers exhibited
very high affinity for their respective target with the calculated KDs in the low nanomolar range (1.55–27.15
nM).

Constants (KDs) of the Aptamers Using
APAA

 	P6	1.55 ± 0.19	0.9251	
Testosterone	T6	2.61 ± 0.52	0.9790	
The second assay used for KD determination
was bead-enzyme linked aptamer assay (bead-ELAA). The same steroid-magnetic
beads used for APAA were employed for this assay, while the aptamers
were modified with a 5′-biotin label to allow direct colorimetric
detection using a streptavidin-polyHRP reporter. The calculated KDs are shown in Table 2, and the binding curves are shown in Figure
S8b (Supporting Information). Aptamers
E28 for estradiol, P5 and P6 for progesterone, and T6 for testosterone
performed equally well in bead-ELAA as in APAA, with the KDs calculated again to be in the low nanomolar range (0.44–39.09
nM). On the other hand, even though the binding of the E11 aptamer
to estradiol was clearly detected, the calculation of the KD was ambiguous; thus, its affinity could not
be determined. Surprisingly, no binding of the E26 aptamer to the
estradiol beads was observed, and it was hypothesized that this could
be attributed to the modification of the sequence with the 5′-biotin
label. Indeed, after the introduction of a T15 spacer between the
biotin label and the 5′-end of the aptamer, the binding properties
of the aptamer were restored. The KD of
the (T15)–E26 aptamer was determined to be 9.12 nM, which was
in the same range as the other aptamers. Because of the loss of binding
of the 5′-modified E26 aptamer to its target, it can be assumed
that its 5′-end is involved in the binding event.

Finally, a microtiter plate-based assay was developed
for the facile,
quantitative measurement of the steroids. This plate-enzyme-linked
aptamer assay (plate-ELAA) was based on the immobilization of the
CMO-steroid derivatives on maleimide-activated plate wells through
an amino-thiol compound. Two different amino-thiols were evaluated
(Figure S10, Supporting Information), and
11-amino-1-undecanethiol containing a long C11 spacer arm (15 Å)
resulted in the specific detection of the immobilized steroid using
a biotin-modified aptamer. Cysteamine was not suitable because it
resulted in high background signals in the absence of the aptamer
and steroid, maybe because of insufficient blocking of the surface
by the layer formed by the short chain (C2, 4 Å). Following immobilization
of the steroids on the plate, the binding affinity of the biotin-modified
aptamers to their respective targets was determined. The calculated KDs are shown in Table 3, and the binding curves are shown in Figure
S8c (Supporting Information). The high
affinity of all aptamers demonstrated with the previous two assays
was also successfully corroborated with plate-ELAA, with KDs in the low/sub-nanomolar range (0.57–2.22 nM).
The small variations observed in the KDs obtained with the different assays could be partially attributed
to the different immobilization levels and spatial distribution of
each steroid on the respective surfaces used (magnetic bead or microplate
well). In addition, the modification of the aptamers at their 5′-end
could potentially affect their binding properties, as was observed
with the E26 aptamer. A further determining factor could be the steric
accessibility, facilitating aptamer-small molecule target binding,
which to some extent is determined by the spacer used to immobilize
the target molecule. The binding of aptamers to small molecules is
often an intercalation event within stems, loops, or three-way junctions,
and it has been proposed that the hydrophobic cavities formed in the
central branching points of three-way junctions can accommodate low
polarity compounds such as steroids37 and
cocaine.38 This kind of DNA folding can
also be observed in the predicted structures of the selected steroid-binding
aptamers (Figure S7, Supporting Information). It is therefore plausible that the long C11 spacer used to tether
the steroid to the microplate surface provided more steric freedom
to facilitate binding, as well as a favorable spatial distribution.
On the other hand, the magnetic beads contain a short C3 spacer arm
which might not facilitate equally well the recognition or stabilization
of the complex after binding. However, the aptamers were expected
to perform well in the APAA and bead-ELAA assays because magnetic
beads were actually used for target immobilization during the selection
process.

2.4 Competitive Plate-ELAA for the Analytical
Determination of Steroids
The detection of small molecular
weight targets is typically achieved using competitive assays. The
design of the competitive ELAA developed in this work for aptamer-based
steroid detection is illustrated in Figure S9 (Supporting Information). The assay was based on the ELAA described
above, which was used for the determination of the binding affinity
of the selected aptamers. Several factors were optimized in order
to enhance the performance of the assay. The amino-thiol compound
used for the immobilization of the steroids on the maleimide-activated
microplate wells was 11-amino-1-undecanethiol, as detailed above and
in the Supporting Information (Figure S10).
The concentration of the CMO-steroid used for immobilization was 100
μM as the use of higher concentrations was not observed to significantly
increase the signals. In order to achieve the lowest possible detection
limits, the duration of the preincubation and incubation steps needs
to be very carefully optimized. The preincubation step is performed
off-plate and consists of the incubation of the biotinylated aptamer
with the sample containing the target molecule. The sample–aptamer
mixture is then added to the wells containing the immobilized target,
and any aptamer not bound to the target in solution is thus available
to bind the immobilized target. Finally, the aptamer–target
complexes in solution are washed away, while the aptamer bound to
the plate-immobilized target is detected using via addition of streptavidin-polyHRP.
Several combinations of preincubation/incubation times were tested
varying from 5 to 30 min for each step (Figure S11, Supporting Information), achieving limits of detection (LOD)
in the range of 14.5–565.4 nM, with shorter incubation times
enhancing sensitivity (Table S9, Supporting Information). To facilitate sample handling within a reasonable period of time,
a combination of 10 min for each of the preincubation and incubation
steps was selected to be optimal. The effect of temperature on assay
performance was then evaluated. The LOD achieved at 22 °C was
lower (80 nM estradiol) compared to that obtained at 37 °C (1079
nM), and 22 °C was thus chosen for all further experiments (Figure
S12, Supporting Information). These conditions
were in fact observed to be optimal for all aptamers (data not shown).
The concentration of each aptamer was also optimized as detailed in
the Supporting Information (Figure S13)
and the concentrations used for the final assays (0.5–12.5
nM) are shown in Table S10 (Supporting Information).

Using these optimized parameters, competition assays were
carried out with steroid concentrations in solution ranging from 13
pM to 200 μM. To establish the selectivity of the aptamers for
their cognate targets, the assays were also performed for the other
two non-target steroids. Each aptamer was therefore studied in combination
with its designated target immobilized on the plate, whereas different
concentrations of the non-target steroids where used in solution for
the competition. The LOD of each aptamer for its respective target
was calculated in the range of 46–183 nM (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Sensitivity and specificity
of the competitive plate-ELAA assays
for steroid detection. The upper panel shows the binding curves of
all aptamers, whereas the LOD and EC50 values calculated for each
steroid are shown below.

Aptamer E28 was found to be the most specific aptamer
for estradiol
among those tested, with an LOD for the target steroid at least 10-fold
lower than those obtained for the non-target steroids (LOD of 46 nM
for estradiol, compared to 462 nM for progesterone, and 1261 nM for
testosterone). Additionally, the EC50 values for progesterone and
testosterone were >10-fold higher. The P5 progesterone aptamer
also
performed well, achieving an LOD of 112 nM for progesterone and significantly
higher LODs of 1373 and 1060 nM for estradiol and testosterone, respectively.
Finally, the testosterone aptamer also performed well, achieving an
LOD of 103 nM for testosterone, and again having markedly higher detection
limits of 1090 and 4725 nM for progesterone and estradiol, respectively.
The excellent binding properties of this aptamer are also reflected
by the EC50 values, which were more than 14-fold and 170-fold higher
for progesterone and estradiol, respectively, as compared to the EC50
value for testosterone.

The binding properties of the aptamers
developed in this work were
compared to other steroid-binding aptamers previously reported in
the literature. In the case of estradiol, various aptamers have been
reported, but the most exploited ones for assay development exhibited
a KD of 13026 and 50 nM.27 Only one progesterone aptamer
has been reported with a KD of 17–112
nM, depending on the method used by the authors to monitor the binding
event.32 There is also only one report
in the literature describing testosterone aptamers and the KD of the various candidates ranged from 0.5
to 50 nM.36 All these aptamers were identified
using classic SELEX approaches where each selection was dedicated
to a single target, and their binding properties were determined using
different approaches. To enable the direct comparison of all the reported
aptamers, an ELAA was used for KD determination.
As can be seen in Figure S14a,b (Supporting Information), the estradiol-binding aptamers reported by Kim et al.26 and Alsager et al.27 exhibited very high affinity for estradiol with KDs in the low nanomolar range, 7.29 and 5.12 nM, respectively.
The binding affinity of these aptamers is thus comparable with the
affinity exhibited for the estradiol-binding aptamers reported in
this work (KDs of 0.87–2.22 nM).
The high affinity of the P4G13 progesterone aptamer reported by Contreras
Jiménez et al.32 was also corroborated
(KD = 1.65 nM, Figure S14c, Supporting Information), which was within the
same range as the affinity displayed by the progesterone aptamers
identified by the one-pot SELEX detailed here (KDs of 0.57–2.03 nM). Finally, the T5 testosterone aptamer
developed by Skouridou et al.36 also demonstrated
extremely high affinity (KD = 0.5 nM,
Figure S14d, Supporting Information), very
similar to the affinity exhibited by the T6 candidate selected in
this work (KD = 0.80 nM). Overall, it
can be concluded that the devised SELEX strategy for one-pot selection
using multiple but structurally similar targets can lead to the identification
of specific aptamers with high affinity, comparable or even superior
to that of aptamers selected via classic SELEX approaches.

3 Conclusions
The selection of aptamers
for various targets employing different
SELEX strategies has been widely reported. However, typically each
SELEX is dedicated to the selection of aptamers for a single target.
We demonstrate that the combination of counter-SELEX selection steps,
NGS, and bioinformatics analysis can lead to the identification of
aptamers binding distinct targets. The steroids estradiol, progesterone,
and testosterone were used as the model target molecules. The estradiol-binding
pool at the end of each round was used as a sub-library for all succeeding
rounds. Progesterone and testosterone were gradually incorporated
in the selection which consisted of sequential incubations of the
ssDNA sub-library with each target. Upon completion of the one-pot
SELEX, NGS was performed to monitor the abundance of sequences within
each pool from the last stage of the selection. This aimed at identifying
potential aptamer candidates with preferential abundance in only one
of the pools which was hypothesized to be related to their specificity.
The binding properties of the selected aptamer candidates were evaluated
using three independent methods. All aptamers exhibited very high
affinity for their corresponding target with KDs in the range of 0.44–27.15 nM, depending on the method
used. Finally, competitive microtiter plate assays were developed
using the selected aptamers and the detection of all steroids was
achieved with LODs in the range of 46–183 nM. In terms of specificity,
most of the aptamers evaluated performed remarkably well because the
obtained LODs for each target steroid were at least 10-fold lower
compared to the ones for the non-target steroids. The best performing
aptamers, E28 for estradiol and T6 for testosterone, also demonstrated
more than 10-fold higher EC50 values for the non-target steroids compared
to the values for their cognate target. These aptamers will be exploited
in lateral flow assays for use at the point-of-care/need, with several
potential applications including monitoring of fertility, where it
is important to specifically detect estradiol and progesterone, while
testosterone levels, which are innately low in females, should be
of low or no significance. An alternative application is the combined
detection of estradiol and testosterone to define maturity of sturgeon
eggs for caviar collection, where the levels of progesterone are irrelevant.
It is crucial to demonstrate the specificity of the aptamers in the
context of the final application assay, and we have demonstrated that
the presence of up to ca. 1.6 μM of the non-target steroids
did not significantly affect the signals obtained with the competitive
plate-ELAA assays; therefore, they are not expected to interfere with
the detection of the target steroid. The strategy presented in this
work could be further expanded to other targets and allow the simultaneous
identification of aptamers binding structurally similar targets with
appropriate specificity depending on the assay requirements, thus
shortening the overall duration and reducing costs related to aptamer
discovery.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Selection Process
For the simultaneous
selection of aptamers binding independently to estradiol, progesterone
or testosterone, a SELEX process was designed, comprising of successive
steps of negative and positive selections using control beads and
three different types of steroid-functionalized magnetic beads (Figures 1 and S2, Supporting Information). The preparation of the
steroid beads is described in the Supporting Information (Figure S1) and the selection strategy is summarized in Table S1.
Each steroid was incorporated at different stages of the selection
as it is summarized in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). In the first round, the random library was incubated with the
estradiol-functionalized beads in binding buffer (20 mM Tris, 100
mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5), followed by washing with
the same buffer and recovering the bound ssDNA for use in the next
round. Negative selection using control magnetic beads (blocked with
sulfo-NHS acetate) was incorporated in the second round to remove
sequences with affinity for the bead matrix. The supernatant obtained
following this incubation step, which contained unbound ssDNA sequences,
was then transferred to a tube containing the estradiol-beads for
positive selection. For rounds 3–10, progesterone-beads were
introduced to the selection process for incubation with the unbound
ssDNA pool after incubation with the control beads. Unbound ssDNA
from the progesterone-beads (supernatant from the progesterone-beads)
was then incubated with the estradiol-beads. For the final rounds
11–15, the testosterone-beads were incorporated. The ssDNA
input pool was incubated first with the control beads, and unbound
ssDNA from each step was successively incubated with the progesterone-beads,
testosterone-beads, and finally the estradiol-beads. At the end of
each selection round, the estradiol-beads were resuspended in 20 μL
of ddH2O and were used directly for PCR amplification with
library-specific forward and phosphorylated reverse primers. For this,
2 μL of the resuspended beads were added to 100 μL of
PCR master mix, and a three-step program was performed as follows:
2 min at 95 °C, 8–16 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30
s at 58 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C, and 5 min at 72 °C.
The PCR reaction was then used as the template for asymmetric PCR
(20 μL per 100 μL of the master mix) which was done under
the same conditions as the first PCR with the exception of the exclusion
of the reverse primer from the master mix and the performance of only
eight cycles during the second step. Finally, lambda exonuclease was
added to the asymmetric PCR reaction for digestion (1.5 h at 37 °C)
and the generated ssDNA was isolated by column purification. Before
each selection round, the ssDNA input pool was diluted in binding
buffer to a final volume of 100 μL, heated at 95 °C for
3 min, and then slowly cooled down to 4 °C before use. Each incubation
step was performed for 30 min at 22 °C under tilt rotation using
2 μL of each bead type. The progress of the selection process
is detailed in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

4.2 NGS and Bioinformatics Analysis
DNA
bound to the estradiol-beads (selection rounds 11, 13, and 15), progesterone-beads
(selection round 15), and testosterone-beads (selection round 15)
was analyzed using NGS. Each sample containing the respective beads
with bound DNA was individually amplified using PCR with different
forward primers, containing distinct barcode sequences, a common reverse
primer, and the resulting dsDNA was column-purified. The pools were
sequenced using Ion Torrent NGS (Centre for Omic Sciences, Eurecat
Technology Centre, Reus, Spain) and the fastq raw data was imported
into the Galaxy web server for analysis. An overall evaluation of
the data and general statistics were obtained using the “FASTQC”
tool. The format of the data was then converted to FASTA using the
“FASTQ to FASTA converter”. The length of the sequences
was constrained to library length (80–100 bp) using the “Filter
sequences by length” tool in order to remove amplification
and sequencing artifacts from the data sets. Unique sequences were
then identified using the “Collapse” tool. The most
abundant sequences from the estradiol rounds 11 and round 13 were
identified after collapsing, analyzed, and characterized as detailed
in the Supporting Information. The first
100 sequences in each pool from the last selection round with the
most number of copies were then searched for unique sequences present
in only one of the pools. The number of copies of each of the selected
sequences within the first megabyte of raw data of each pool from
the last selection round was then registered. Finally, selected candidates
with preferential abundance in only one of the pools were identified
as potential binders with specificity to each target (see the Supporting Information for more details). Multiple
sequence alignment of these sequences using the external tool Clustal
Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) was finally performed in order to identify sequence families. Based
on this information and the number of copies of each sequence in each
of the target pools, the final aptamer candidates were chosen for
characterization.

4.3 Affinity Dissociation Constants (KD) Determination by APAA
APAA was performed as
previously described.36 Each unmodified
aptamer (156 pM to 10 nM) was incubated with each of the four types
of magnetic beads (control, progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol)
in binding buffer for 30 min at 22 °C under tilt rotation. After
thorough washing, steroid beads with bound sequences were amplified
using PCR using library-specific primers and the intensity of the
gel electrophoresis bands was estimated using the ImageJ software.
The KDs of the aptamers were calculated
using the GraphPad Prism 6 software and the “One site—Specific
binding with the Hill slope” model. Triplicate measurements
were carried out for each aptamer concentration tested.

4.4 KD Determination
by Bead-ELAA
For bead-ELAA, the aptamer candidates were modified
with a 5′ biotin label, with or without a T15 spacer. Each
modified aptamer (1.56–200 nM) was separately incubated with
the four different types of magnetic beads (control, progesterone,
testosterone, and estradiol) for 30 min at 22 °C under tilt rotation
in binding buffer. The beads with bound aptamers were then washed
and streptavidin-polyHRP80 (0.05 μg/mL in binding buffer) was
added, followed by another 30 min incubation step. After a final washing
step, the beads were resuspended, TMB substrate was added, and following
a brief incubation at room temperature, an equal volume of 1 M H2SO4 was added to stop color development. The supernatants
were separated from the beads using a magnet, transferred to a microtiter
plate, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The KDs of the aptamers were calculated using the GraphPad
Prism 6 software and the “One site—Specific binding
with Hill slope” model. Triplicate measurements were carried
out for each aptamer concentration tested.

4.5 KD Determination
by Plate-ELAA
Plate-ELAA was performed using maleimide-activated
plate wells functionalized with 11-amino-1-undecanethiol hydrochloride
(MUAM, 100 μM in PBS) after overnight incubation at 4 °C.
The wells were washed with PBS followed by the addition of a mixture
of the CMO-steroid derivatives with EDC/NHS and incubation for 2 h
at 22 °C for steroid immobilization. After washing with PBS,
the wells were blocked with sulfo-NHS acetate (1 mM in PBS) for 1
h at 22 °C followed by a final washing step with PBS. Different
concentrations of each modified aptamer (with a 5′ biotin label,
with or without a T15 spacer, in binding buffer) were then added to
each of the wells and incubated for 30 min at 22 °C, followed
by washing, the addition of streptavidin-polyHRP80 (0.05 μg/mL
in PBST), and another 30 min incubation. Finally, the wells were washed
with PBST, the TMB substrate was added, and color development was
terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 1 M H2SO4 followed by measurement of absorbance at 450 nm. The KDs of the aptamers were calculated using the
GraphPad Prism 6 software and the “One site—Specific
binding with Hill slope” model. Triplicate measurements were
carried out for each aptamer concentration tested.

4.6 Detection of Steroids by Competitive Plate-ELAA
The selected aptamers were used for the development of competitive
microplate-based assays for the detection of each steroid. The optimization
of various assay parameters is detailed in the Supporting Information. MUAM-functionalized microplate wells
were initially prepared followed by the immobilization of the CMO-steroid
derivatives as detailed in the “Plate-ELAA” section.
Each aptamer (0.5–12.5 nM) was pre-incubated with free steroid
solutions (13 pM to 200 μM in binding buffer containing 5% v/v
ethanol) for 10 min at 22 °C (“pre-incubation step”).
The aptamer-steroid mixtures were then transferred to the steroid-immobilized
microplate wells, followed by another 10 min incubation at 22 °C
(“incubation step”). After thorough washing with PBST,
streptavidin-polyHRP80 (0.05 μg/mL in PBST) was added and incubated
for further 30 min at 22 °C, followed by a final washing step
and addition of the TMB substrate. The signal at 450 nm was recorded
following the addition of an equal volume of 1 M H2SO4. The signals obtained as a function of the concentration
of the free steroid were plotted with GraphPad Prism and fitted to
a sigmoidal model (four parameter logistic model where X is the log concentration). The LODs were defined as the highest
signal obtained (top of the fitted curve) minus three times its standard
deviation (Top – 3SDTop), and they were interpolated from the
fitted curves. The EC50 values were calculated directly by the software.
Triplicate measurements were performed for each target concentration.
