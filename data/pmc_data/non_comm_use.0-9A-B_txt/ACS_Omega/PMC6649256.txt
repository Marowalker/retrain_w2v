Here
we describe the synthesis and spectroscopic and structural
characterization of various borazine-doped polyphenylenes displaying
high doping dosages (16–18%). Capitalizing on the condensation
reaction approach, the desired products were formed using a mixture
of p-phenylendiamine and aniline with BCl3, followed by the addition of an aryl lithium derivative. The use
of mesityl lithium (MesLi) yields strained multiborazine derivatives,
which proved to be unstable in the presence of moisture. However,
when xylyl lithium (XylLi) was used, chemically stable multiborazines
were obtained, with oligomers showing molecular weight up to 104, corresponding to 16–18 monomer units. While the dimer,
trimer, and tetramer could be isolated as pure products and their
structure characterized by mass and NMR analysis, higher oligomers
could only be isolated as mixtures of B-hydroxy-substituted
derivatives and characterized by gel permeation chromatography. The
structures of the dimer and trimer derivatives were confirmed by X-ray
analysis, which nicely showed the presence of the two and three borazine
rings spaced by one and two 1,4-aryl bridges, respectively. Notably,
the trimer forms a porous crystalline clathrate. The peripheral xylyl
and phenyl moieties of each molecule intramolecularly embrace each
other through C–H and π–π stacking interactions.
Steady-state UV–vis absorption characterization suggested that
the molecules are UV absorbers, with the extinction coefficient linearly
scaling with the degree of oligomerization. On the other hand, low-emission
quantum yields were obtained for all derivatives (<7%), suggesting
that high BN-doping dosages dramatically affect the emission properties
of the doped polyphenylenes.

Introduction
In the last decade,
the development of doping methods1−3 to replace C=C
bonds with B=N has proved to be one
of the most promising synthetic approaches to tailor material properties
both at the molecular and the nanoscale levels.4−11 The interest is related to the peculiar characteristics of polar
B=N bonds that,10 being isoelectronic
and isostructural to C=C bonds, allow the tuning of the optoelectronic
properties12−14 of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and parent molecular
graphenes without significant peripheral modifications of the molecular
scaffold.15−23 In this respect, a lot of efforts have been dedicated to the development
of BN-doped polymeric8,24−28 and dendrimeric29 materials
for applications in gas storage and separation,30 optoelectronic devices,19,21,22,27,31 self-assembly on surfaces,32−34 and in the bottom-up synthesis
of BN-doped nanographenes.35,36 Although suffering
from low stability toward hydrolysis,37 El-Kaderi’s porous polyborazino materials, prepared by condensation
reaction and used to store H2, are certainly the seminal
examples in the field (Figure 1).38,39

Figure 1 Synthetic strategy toward borazino-doped
polymers and oligomers.

Inspired by Nagasawa’s observations, who reported
a moisture-stable B-trimesityl-N-triphenylborazine in 1965,
and later by the group of Yamaguchi,40 our
group dedicated a lot of effort on the development of BN-doped polyphenylenes
that are chemically and thermally stable.29 In particular, we recently described the divergent synthesis of
borazino-doped polyphenylenes, taking advantage of the decarbonylative
Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction between ethynyl and tetraphenylcyclopentadienone-borazine
based precursors. Owing to the possibility of functionalizing the
borazine core with different groups on the aryl substituents at the
N and B atoms, we have prepared borazino-doped polyphenylenes featuring
different doping dosages (ρ) and orientations (o). The ρ value is defined as the percentage of the aryl units
that have been substituted with the borazine analogues, whereas the
orientational parameter o defines the relative orientation
between the doping borazine rings.29 Detailed
photophysical investigations showed that, increasing the ρ value
to 6%, the strong fluorescent signal is progressively reduced. On
the contrary, a negligible effect of the orientational o doping was observed. This observation suggested that high values
of ρ accelerated the nonradiative deactivation of the singlet
excited state through a possible combination of intersystem crossing,
increased charge separation character of the excited state and vibrational
relaxation.29 To further expand and study
the doping portfolio of polyphenylenes, we envisaged to prepare oligomeric
BN-doped polyphenylenes featuring higher doping dosages. Conceptually,
high ρ values can be achieved either by (i) replacing as many
phenyl rings as possible with borazine rings or (ii) reducing the
number of peripheral and core phenyl rings. Building on the latter
approach, in this work we report on the synthesis of oligomeric borazines
in which the hexaphenyl aryl bridge is replaced by 1,4-aryl linkers.
Capitalizing on the condensation reaction between aniline and BCl3 followed by the addition of an organolithium aryl derivative,31,40 we have isolated BN-doped polyphenylenes with high ρ values
(>16%). X-ray characterization confirmed the structures of the
dimeric
and trimeric borazines, whereas photophysical investigations confirmed
the UV-absorption properties of the materials, as well as their doping-dependent
emission properties.

Results and Discussion
Building
on El-Kaderi’s approach,38,39 we attempted the preparation
of borazine-doped polyphenylenes using
BCl3 in the presence of a given mixture of aniline and p-phenylendiamine in refluxing toluene (Scheme 1a). A first attempt was carried
out using a 4:1 mixture of aniline and p-phenylendiamine
with BCl3, followed by the addition of MesLi. Purification
of the reaction mixture with SiO2 gel column chromatography
led to the isolation of 1Mes and 2Mes in 10 and 2% yield, respectively.
When using a 2:1 ratio of aniline and p-phenylendiamine,
high quantities of oligoborazinic fractions were obtained after addition
of MesLi. Similarly, molecule 1Mes was isolated in 6% yield along with a fraction containing a mixture
of oligomers. Separation of the oligomeric mixture via recycling-gel
permeation chromatography (Rec-GPC, Scheme 1b) led to the isolation of dimer 2Mes (5% yield) and a fraction containing
trimer 3Mes (3% yield). The molecular
structures of the oligomers were identified by NMR spectroscopy and
mass spectrometry, the latter allowing the detection of the peak corresponding
to the molecular ion (M+).

However, degradation of both 2Mes and in particular 3Mes was noticed upon exposure to ambient moisture condition, which
made
the isolation of pure 3Mes an
impossible task using classical chromatographic techniques. Suitable
crystals for X-ray analysis were obtained for molecule 2Mes (Figure 2) by slow evaporation of a CHCl3 solution.
As expected, the crystal structure shows the presence of two borazine
rings, linked at the nitrogen atoms through a 1,4-aryl spacer. The
molecular structure reveals a substantial deviation from the orthogonal
arrangement of the aryl substituents and the borazine ring with an
interplanar angle between 55.5 and 77.3°. Interestingly, the
intra-annular distance values between B and N atoms within the borazine
rings are between 1.441(1) and 1.448(1) Å, whereas the average
internal NBN and BNB angles are 117.09(7)° and 122.31(7)°,
respectively. The central BN core displays a significant structural
deformation, with a r.m.s. deviation of 0.14 Å of the core BN
atoms from the average plane.

clarity reasons.

When looking at the crystal
structure of 2Mes, one can clearly
notice that the 4-methyl group
of Mes substituents at the bay position undergoes steric clashes,
forcing the two neighboring BN cores to accommodate on two parallel
planes (interplanar distance of 0.14 Å), straining the dimeric
derivative and distorting the borazine ring. This results in a reduced
steric protection of the boron atoms, which possibly leads to an increased
susceptibility of the borazine cores toward hydrolysis. All together,
these observations suggest that, if one wants to improve the stability
of such oligomeric borazines toward hydrolysis, B-aryl moieties bearing
no substituents at the para position should be used. Therefore, we
conjectured that addition of xylyl lithium (XylLi) would afford uncongested
oligoborazines with a reduced strain content. Building on this idea,
we reacted a 2:1 mixture of aniline and p-phenylendiamine
with BCl3 and quenched it with XylLi. Capitalizing on a
combination of multiple chromatographic separations (see the Supporting Information), we could isolate 1Xyl (16% yield), 2Xyl (7% yield), 3Xyl (1% yield), 2XylOH (2%
yield), 4Xyl (0.1% yield, probably
as a mixture of iso and normal isomers, Scheme 1) along with an inseparable mixture of oligomeric
products. The structural identity of the monodispersed fractions was
first demonstrated by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), which
confirmed the molecular mass for all oligomers (1Xyl, [C42H43B3N3]+ calcd, 622.3736; found, 622.3766; 2Xyl, [C78H78B6N6]+ calcd, 1164.6846; found,
1164.6812; 3Xyl, [C114H114B9N9]+ calcd, 1708.0035;
found, 1707.9987; 2XylOH, [C70H70B6N6O]+ calcd,
1076.6169; found, 1076.6207; and 4Xyl, [C150H150B12N12]+ calcd, 2251.3223; found, 2251.3375). As the mixture
of higher oligomers could not be separated, the product was analyzed
using size exclusion chromatography calibrated on a poly(methylmethacrylate)
standard (Figures S31 and S32). GPC analysis
suggested that the fraction is mainly composed by oligomers displaying
MW up to 104 Da, scoring an average molecular weight of
1900 Da and a dispersity of 1.97. The 11B NMR spectrum
displayed a peak centered at 37.5 ppm (diagnostic for borazine core)
together with a low-intensity resonance at 25.2 ppm, typical of a
boron specie linked to an oxygen atom. Considering that the IR spectrum
of these oligomers closely resembles that of 2XylOH (see experimental part) with an intense OH-stretching
absorption band centered at 3612 cm–1, it is suggested
that higher oligomers are mainly composed of hydroxylated species.

Suitable crystals for X-ray diffraction were obtained for 1Xyl (slow evaporation of CHCl3, Figure 3), 2Xyl, 3Xyl (diffusion of pentane in a CHCl3 solution, Figures 4 and 5), and 2XylOH (slow evaporation
of a 1:1 CH2Cl2/petroleum ether mixture, Figures 6 and 7). Whereas the X-ray structure of 1Xyl closely resembles that obtained
from the tri-B-mesityl derivatives previously reported
by us (Figure 3),31 the structure of bisborazine 2Xyl is less strained (Figure 4d) than that of its congener, 2Mes. Contrary to 2Mes, the absence of the 4-methyl groups lessens the
steric hindrance between the B-aryl substituents, allowing the two
borazine cores in 2Xyl to adopt
a tilted conformation with an interplanar angle of 32° (Figure 4b). As a result,
the boron atoms in the borazine core remain sterically shielded by
the methyl groups, thus making derivative 2Xyl chemically stable toward hydrolysis, just as monomeric
derivative 1Xyl.

The same conformational pattern observed for dimer 2Xyl was also noticed in the X-ray
structure
of 3Xyl (Figure 5). In this case, three borazine units are
linked through two 1,4-aryl spacers. If one considers the central
borazine as the reference core, the two peripheral borazine rings
adopt opposite tilted arrangements because of the steric hindrance
between the xylyl substituents at the concave bay position, with interplanar
angles of −53.0 and 53.5°, respectively. At the molecular
level, the conformation develops into a helicene-type structure, with
both enantiomers equally present in the crystal structure (Figure 5b–d). When
looking at the crystal packing, it is apparent that molecule 3Xyl forms a hierarchized hexagonal
porous network at the solid state (Figure 6) with each pore surrounded by six molecules
and displaying a diameter of 32 Å (Figure 6c). In the hierarchical structure, the molecules
between different pores (Figure 6a,b) are held together by CH−π interactions
through the interdigitation of peripheral aryl and phenyl groups (Figure 6a). Interestingly,
three solvent molecules of pentane are also entrapped in the noncovalent
hexagonal framework through CH−π interactions at each
vertex.

As far as 2XylOH is concerned,
we found out that the molecule can crystallize in two different polymorphs
α [unit cell: a = 18.861(4) Å; b = 22.390(4) Å; c = 14.820(3) Å]
and β [a = 11.350(2) Å; b = 16.679(3) Å; c = 32.207(6) Å], forming
rod- and plate-shape crystals, respectively. In both polymorphs, the
crystal structure of 2XylOH appears
to be strain-free. Whereas in polymorph β the two borazine cores
adopt an almost co-planar conformation (interplanar angle of 1.5°, Figure 8b), in the α
crystals the BN rings form an interplanar angle of 39° (Figures S4, S5 and S8). If one considers molecule 2Xyl being stable under ambient conditions,
it is unlikely that 2XylOH could
arise from direct hydrolysis of its arylated derivative. As we could
isolate only derivatives bearing the B–OH group at the bay
position, one can hypothesize that the hydrolysis reaction could occur
at the B–Cl groups that, being sterically hindered, did not
react with XylLi.

coefficient at excitation wavelengths.

In order to study the effect
of high doping dosages on the optoelectronic
properties of borazine-polyphenylenes, the steady-state UV–vis
absorption and emission properties of 1Xyl, 2Xyl, 3Xyl, and 4Xyl were studied (Figure 8, Table 1).
As reported in the absorption spectra displayed in Figure 8a, all borazine-doped polyphenylenes
absorb in the UV spectral region, with absorption maxima ranging from
260 to 280 nm. Although the extinction coefficients linearly scale
with the molecular size of the oligomers when passing from 1Xyl to 4Xyl (Figure 8b),
no significant bathochromic shifts are observed. These observations
suggest that the absorption properties of these oligomers are additive,
and that no significant π-conjugation occurs upon extension
of the oligomers. Luminescence studies of air-equilibrated CH2Cl2 solutions of all borazine derivatives showed
significant radiative UV emission profiles (λmax =
266, 272, and 280 nm, Table 1) and very short lifetimes (τfl = 1.24–1.66
ns, Table 1) consistent
with the presence of excited singlet radiative deactivation. No significant
changes in the emission profiles were observed at 77 K for the fluorescence
spectra. All solutions showed very low quantum yields (Φem = 2–7%; Table 1). These data are in line with those obtained with highly
doped borazino-polyphenylenes, for which high BN dosages enhance the
deactivation rate of the singlet excited state.29 When cooled to 77 K, non-negligible phosphorescence emission
has been also observed (Figure 8), showing double-peak emission profiles, also in line with
borazino-polyphenylenes.29 Representative
phosphorescence lifetime measurements showed long-lasting emission
profiles (τph ca. ∼1.11–1.56 s).

Conclusions
In conclusion, in this
paper we have reported the synthesis, through
a condensation reaction, of borazino-doped polyphenylene derivatives
displaying high doping dosages (16–18%). The use of MesLi yielded
strained derivatives, the latter revealing to be unstable in the presence
of moisture. However, in the presence of XylLi, chemically stable
derivatives were obtained, with a maximum degree of oligomerization
of 16–18 units. Whereas the dimer, trimer, and tetramer could
be isolated as pure products, higher oligomers could be only isolated
as mixtures and characterized by GPC. The structures of the dimer
and trimer molecules were confirmed by X-ray analysis, which nicely
showed the presence of the two and three borazine rings spaced by
one and two 1,4-aryl bridges, respectively. Notably, the trimer formed
a porous crystalline clathrate with pentane at the solid state. Photophysical
characterization suggested that the molecules are UV absorbers, with
the excitation coefficient linearly scaling with the degree of oligomerization.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, Acros Organics, TCI, Apollo Scientific, Alfa Aesar,
and Fluorochem and were used as received. Solvents were purchased
from Fisher Scientific, whereas deuterated solvents from Eurisotop
and Sigma-Aldrich. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were dried on
a Braun MB SPS-800 solvent purification system and further dried over
activated 4 Å molecular sieves. 2-Bromomesitylene and 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene
were dried over activated 4 Å molecular sieves. Aniline was distilled
from CaH2 under N2 and stored away from light
in an N2 atmosphere. Aniline was left on CaH2 overnight prior to distillation. Low-temperature baths were prepared
using different solvent mixtures depending on the desired temperature:
−84 °C with ethyl acetate/liq. N2, and 0 °C
with ice/H2O. Anhydrous conditions were achieved by drying
Schlenk tubes or two-neck flasks by flaming with a heat gun under
vacuum and purging with nitrogen. The inert atmosphere was maintained
using nitrogen-filled balloons equipped with a syringe and needle
that was used to penetrate the silicon stoppers used to close the
flasks’ necks. Additions of liquid reagents were performed
using plastic syringes. Degassing of solutions was performed using
the freeze–pump–thaw (fpt) procedure: solutions were
frozen using liquid nitrogen and kept under vacuum for 10′
before thawing. Molecular sieves (4 Å) were activated by heating
at 165 °C under vacuum overnight and by further heating with
heat gun under vacuum immediately before use. All reactions were performed
in dry conditions and under inert atmosphere unless otherwise stated.

Synthesis of Borazines 1Mes and 2Mes
In a flame-dried
20 mL Schlenk-type flask, aniline (0.26 mL, 2.85 mmol), p-phenylendiamine (0.15 g, 1.40 mmol), and dry toluene (6 mL) were
added. The mixture was heated at 80 °C under Ar and BCl3 (1 M in heptane, 6.00 mL) added dropwise. The resulting suspension
was stirred under refluxing conditions for 18 h, then cooled down
to rt and subjected to 5 fpt cycles to remove the excess HCl. In parallel,
to a solution of 2-bromomesitylene (0.71 mL, 4.70 mmol) in dry THF
(15 mL), tBuLi (1.7 M in hexanes, 5.80
mL) was added dropwise at −84 °C. The solution was allowed
to warm at 0 °C and stirred for 10 min. The degassed toluene
suspension was thus transferred to the organometallic-containing THF
solution at 0 °C and allowed to react for 18 h at rt. The final
mixture was diluted with EtOAc (90 mL) and washed with water (3 ×
100 mL) and brine (50 mL). The organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure. The products were
purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluent: PE*/CH2Cl2 8:2) to afford 1Mes (36 mg, 6%) as a white powder. Additionally, a mixture of
other products was obtained. These were separated by Rec-GPC using
CHCl3 as eluent to afford 2Mes (40 mg, 5%) as a white powder. *Petroleum ether.

Synthesis of Borazines 1Xyl, 2Xyl, 3Xyl, and 4Xyl
In a flame-dried 100 mL Schlenk-type
flask, aniline (0.49 mL, 5.37
mmol), p-phenylendiamine (0.29 g, 2.68 mmol), and
dry toluene (12 mL) were added. The mixture was heated at 80 °C
under N2 and BCl3 (1 M in heptane, 11.5 mL)
added dropwise. The reaction was cooled down to 0 °C and stirred
for 10 min. The resulting suspension was heated under refluxing conditions
for 18 h, cooled down to rt, and subjected to 5 fpt cycles to remove
the excess HCl. In parallel, to a solution of 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene
(2.16 mL, 16.08 mmol) in dry THF (40 mL), nBuLi (1.6 M in hexanes, 10.70 mL) was added dropwise at −84
°C. The solution was allowed to warm at 0 °C, and stirred
for 10 min. The degassed toluene suspension was transferred to the
organometal-containing THF solution at 0 °C and allowed to react
for 18 h at rt. The final mixture was diluted with EtOAc (150 mL)
and washed with water (2 × 100 mL) and brine (2 × 100 mL).
The organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and evaporated under
reduced pressure. The solid residue was precipitated from cold MeOH
and filtered. The resulting white solid was purified by silica gel
column chromatography (eluent: PE/CH2Cl2 7:3)
to afford 1Xyl (182 mg, 16%)
and 2Xyl (107 mg, 7%) as white
powders. Additionally, three fractions composed by mixtures of products
were obtained. The first two fractions were purified by Rec-GPC using
CHCl3 as eluent. Purification of the first fraction afforded 3Xyl (19 mg, 1%) and 2XylOH (22 mg, 2%) as white powders. Purification
of the second fraction gave 4Xyl (iso and n isomers), which was further purified
with preparative thin-layer chromatography (eluent: PE/CH2Cl2 6:4) to give the desired product (2 mg, 0.1%). The
third fraction was analyzed by GPC at Warwick University and resulted
in a mixture of hydroxylated oligomers (see Section S4 of the Supporting Information for GPC analysis).
