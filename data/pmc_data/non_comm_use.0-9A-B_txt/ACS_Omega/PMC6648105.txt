Fluorescent
nitrogen-doped graphene oxide dots (NGODs) have been
demonstrated as an on–off nanosensor for the detection of Hg2+, Au3+, and H2O2. As compared
to l-cystine, where the luminescence signal recovery results
from the detachment of Hg2+ from the NGODs, signal recovery
through l-ascorbic acid (turn-off–on model) has been
attributed to the reduction of Hg2+ to Hg0.
The sustainable recovery of the photoluminescence signal is demonstrated
using common citrus fruits containing vitamin C (l-AA), suggesting
a promising practical usage of this sensing system. Additionally,
the sensitivity of NGOD- and AA-originated signal recovery from the
Hg(II)–NGODs mixture has been successfully tested in Hg2+ ion-spiked tap water from three different places. Mimic
devices were executed and verified on the basis of characteristic
spectral changes, and the possible utility of this system in electronic
security and memory element devices has also been demonstrated. Considering
an easy synthesis process and excellent performance of NGODs, this
investigation opens up new opportunities for preparing high-quality
fluorescent NGODs to meet the requirements of many applications.

Introduction
Carbon-based fluorescent
nanomaterials1,2 have
attracted attention because of their low-cost design and possible
applications in different fields such as photocatalysis, optoelectronics,
bioimaging,3−6 and sensing. Some of the reported fabrication methods7,8 are relatively complicated and accompanied with the requirement
of strong acids, which could be environmentally undesirable and hazardous.
Because of low toxicity, simple preparation methods, and relatively
stable fluorescence signal output from carbon dots (CDs), accurate
detection results have been reported for several metal ions, biomolecules,9,10 temperature,11 pH,10 small organic molecules,12 and
hydrogen peroxide.13,14

In particular, H2O2 has broad industrial
applications with vital significance in various processes,13,14 such as a by-product in several enzyme-catalyzed reactions, namely,
lactate, cholesterol, glucose oxidase, and so forth.15−17 In order to obtain uninterrupted electron transfer, different types
of composite materials (enzymes, polymers, dyes, metals, and metal
oxides) have been proposed for H2O2 sensing.
Among several analytical techniques (electrochemical,18 spectrophotometry,19 chemiluminescence,20 and fluorimetry21), due to the industrial importance of H2O2, fluorimetry has been found to be a simple, fast, and sensitive
approach for the detection of H2O2. Chakraborty
et al.22 reported the fluorescence quenching
of C-dots (turn-off) sensor for H2O2 in the
presence of Fe2+. Recently, Chakraborty et al. and Bhunia
et al.22,23 reported H2O2 sensors
(turn-off) from hemoglobin-derived and hemoglobin-functionalized Fe2+-containing CDs. Zhang et al. and Wang et al.24,25 have also reported sensitive detection of H2O2 (turn-off), using fluorescent CDs coupled with other noble metals.
Song et al.26 found H2O2-originated quenching of yellow fluorescence from CDs synthesized
from relatively toxic o-phenylenediamine.

Among
the metal ions, Hg2+ is one of the most dangerous
inorganic pollutants for the environment27−32 because of its persistence, accumulation, and high toxicity, that
is, its exposure has been reported to cause several diseases (neurological,
reproductive, and digestive) and even mortality.33−37 Adverse effects of Hg2+ ions call for
an urgent need to develop a fast and convenient detection technique.27−37 Apart from the detection of different metal ions, such as Ag+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Fe3+, Cr6+, Zn2+, Au3+, and Co2+,
graphene-based Hg2+ sensors have been studied in the last
decade because of low cost, fast response, and high sensitivity. Among
the recent Hg2+ sensors, Zhang and Chen28 reported the specificity (fluorescence quenching; turn-off)
of hydrothermally synthesized N-doped CDs using folic acid as N and
C precursors with a detection limit of 0.23 μM. In succession,
N/S co-doped (Wang et al.) CDs prepared with a simple microwave method29 without any functionalization revealed the detection
limit of 0.18 μM for Hg2+ and a linear signal recovery
in the presence of cyanide and hydrogen sulfide (HS–) anions. Yan et al.30 and Zhang et al.31 also reported the fluorescence quenching and
the restoration of the signal through cysteine because of the binding
preference for Hg2+. Recently,32 pineapple peel-derived CDs have been tested for reversibility of
the fluorescence signal from the CD nanoprobe with alternate addition
of Hg2+ and l-cystine (l-Cys) and additionally
demonstrated for their possible utility in electronic security devices
and memory element. Although, using nitrogen-doped carbon nanodots
derived from various carbon sources reported the “turn-off–on”
Hg2+ sensor using a photoluminescence (PL) recovering agent
such as cyanide/hydrogen sulfide ions and cysteine, simultaneous implementation
of low cost and sustainable efficient recovery from renewable/green
inexpensive methods is still challenging.

Ascorbic acid (AA)
and citrus fruits have recently been found effective
in recovering the luminescence signal (“on-off-on” sensor)
from citric acid-based CDs through the reduction of Cr6+/Fe3+ to Cr3+/Fe2+. Some groups33−36 have reported a similar “off-on” approach with AA
for Fe3+/Cr6+-originated PL quenching of hydrothermally
prepared CDs and g-C3N4 nanosheets, respectively.
The turn-ON fluorescence in the presence of AA is explained through
the redox reaction between Fe3+/Cr6+ (reducing
to Fe2+/Cr3+) and AA. Recently, Luo et al.37 reported a switchable sensor based on N and
S co-doped CDs to determine AA content in common fruits via signal
recovery of Fe3+ (off) caused fluorescence quenching of
CDs.

Furthermore, in spite of the proposed therapeutic use of
gold,
Au3+ is known to be toxic for human beings as the soluble
salts of gold have been reported to damage kidneys, nervous system,
and liver.33 Because of the possible usefulness
of fluorescent probes as an analytical tool in the field of medicine,
environment, and chemistry, Gu et al.38 and Liao et al.39 reported CDs/NCDs as
a fluorescent label-free detection of Au3+.

Considering
all of the above facts, in this study, citric acid
and urea were chosen to hydrothermally prepare fluorescent nitrogen-doped
graphene oxide dots (NGODs) for fluorimetry-based detection (turn-off)
of H2O2, Hg2+, and Au3+ along with the sustained recovery of the signal for Hg(II) using
AA and citrus fruits. We additionally demonstrate the application
of such system as a molecular keypad lock and memory device using
logic gates.

Results and Discussion
The size
distribution of as-prepared NGODs was analyzed through
transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Figure 1a). The corresponding histogram (shown in Figure 1b) taken over 55
particles reveals its narrow-size distribution. The measured particle
size range of 2–5.5 nm, with an average diameter of 3.8 ±
1.7 nm (Figure 1b),
is in good agreement with the already reported data.40

Figure 1 (a) TEM image of as-prepared NGODs and (b) size distribution analysis
from (a). (c) Fluorescence emission spectra of NGODs after excitation
of 290–400 nm, (d) analysis of excitation wavelength vs intensity
from PL spectra, and (e) UV–visible spectra and PLE spectra
of NGODs at 441 nm. The inset shows NGODs illuminated under daylight
and UV light 365 nm.

Figure 1c
shows
the fluorescence emission intensity of NGODs at excitation wavelength
range from 290 to 400 nm. It is clear that NGODs emit strong blue
fluorescence at 441 nm after the irradiation (inset of Figure 1e). The PL emission intensity
increases from 270 to 340 nm and then decreases in the range of 350–400
nm, indicating 344 nm as the optimal excitation wavelength for NGODs
(Figure 1d). The PL
excitation (PLE) spectrum measured at 441 nm (emission) (Figure 1e, blue spectra)
additionally confirms the same. Moreover, the as-prepared NGODs exhibit
two distinct absorption bands at around 235 nm (π → π*)
and 344 nm (n → π*) in the UV–visible spectrum
(Figure 1e, black spectra);
the absorption at 344 nm (in conformity with the PLE results) is attributed
to nitrogen (the doping element) as well as the strong absorption
band corresponding to the graphitic structure.41

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of NGODs (Figure 2a) exhibits a sharp
peak centered
at 11.31°, which is attributed to the graphitic structure with
an interlayer spacing (001) of 0.78 nm.42−44 The survey scan of NGODs
clearly shows the major peaks at 532, 400, and 285 eV, corresponding
to the characteristic peaks of O 1s, N 1s, and C 1s, respectively.
The occurrence of the N 1s (400 eV) peak confirms the existence of
nitrogen atom in NGODs (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) peaks of C 1s, O 1s, and N 1s are deconvoluted to understand
the chemical species present in NGODs. After deconvolution of C 1s
peak of NGODs, C–C/C=C (284.3 eV), C–O (285.6
eV), C=O (287.7 eV), and O–C=O (289.2 eV) are
observed (Figure 2b),
revealing the existence of carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups
on the surface of NGODs. Additionally, the contribution of C–N
(286.5 eV) confirms the successful incorporation of N atoms onto the
NGOD structure.

Figure 2 (a) XRD patterns of as-prepared NGODs (the inset shows
enlarged
view of the NGOD peak); deconvoluted XPS spectra of (b) C 1s, (c)
O 1s, and (d) N 1s peaks of NGODs.

Figure 2c,d
showing
the deconvoluted O 1s (531.6 and 533.0 eV assigned as C=O and
C–O, respectively) and N 1s peaks (pyridinic N at 399.6 eV
and graphitic N/amine N at 401.3 eV) of NGODs also reveals similar
results. Hence, XPS results confirm the presence of N as well as oxygen-containing
functional groups in NGODs. Additionally, the Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectrum of NGODs, shown as Figure S2 (Supporting Information), exhibiting a strong peak at 3320
cm–1, designated to O–H group (stretching
vibration), is in good agreement with the XPS observation with respect
to the O 1s peak. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface suggests
good hydrophilic property of NGODs. Other bands located at 2343 and
1644 cm–1 in the NGOD-based materials correspond
to the N–H bond (stretching vibration) and C=C bond
(bending vibration), respectively, of graphene.45

Because of the sensitivity of NGOD’s PL properties,
they
have been investigated for H2O2 sensing. Figure 3a shows the PL spectra
(λex = 344 nm and λem = 441 nm)
obtained for NGODs in aqueous solution with the addition of H2O2 in the concentration range of 22–3777
μM. As expected, the PL intensity of NGODs decreases with increasing
H2O2 concentration, for example, with [H2O2] = 3.7 × 10–3 M, the
PL from the NGOD solution was quenched by more than 90%. Figure 3b displays the concentration
of H2O2 versus PL intensity at 441 nm. A good
linear correlation (R2 = 0.974) is shown
under low concentrations ranging from 0 to 225 μM with 0.2 μM
as a limit of detection (LOD) at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The
possible quenching mechanism after the adsorption of H2O2 on NGODs has been attributed to the electron transfer.
In fact, it is well known that organic groups such as alcohols can
be oxidized to aldehydes or carboxylic acids by the presence of H2O2 which is reduced to H2O13 and hence modify the chemical environment around
NGODs leading to the change of the PL properties of the nanoprobes.
Herein, the PL reduction rate depends mainly on the adsorption of
H2O2 at the surface of NGODs, reducing the electron-transfer
process.

Figure 3 PL quenching pattern of NGODs in deionized water with the presence
of different concentrations of H2O2 (a) PL vs
wavelength for λex = 344 nm, (b) PL peak intensity
vs H2O2 concentration (the inset shows linear
fit at low concentrations; R2 = 0.974),
and (c) possible quenching mechanism due to H2O2 adsorption on NGODs, wherein the alcohol groups are oxidized to
aldehyde groups.

The addition of different
Hg2+/Au3+ concentrations
to NGODs (Figures 4 and 5a,c) results in a drastic decrement
in the PL signal intensity, implying an electron transfer between
NGODs and Hg2+/Au3+. The fluorescence spectroscopic
changes indicate that the Hg2+/Au3+ ions coordinate
with different functional groups (i.e., amine, hydroxyl, and carboxyl)
present on the surface of NGODs because of the electron donor character
of nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) atoms. Hence, the coordination between
functional groups on the surface favored and facilitated the electron
transfer between NGODs and Hg2+/Au3+.46 In other words, the proposed quenching mechanism
suggests the involvement of Hg2+/Au3+ ions as
efficient electron acceptors or holes giving rise to the initiation
of nonradiative electron transfer. The electrons in the excited state
of NGODs can transfer to the unfilled orbitals (6p/6d) of Hg2+/Au3+, leading to significant quenching in the PL signal.
This observation establishes NGODs as a potential candidate for the
turn-off Hg2+/Au3+ sensor. For Hg2+ and Au3+, turn-off sensing shows a good linear correlation
with R2 as 0.954 and 0.995, respectively,
under concentrations ranging from 0 to 275 μM and 0 to 300 μM
with LOD to be 0.2 μM for Hg2+ and 0.25 μM
for Au3+ at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 (Figure 5b,d). The TEM images (Figure 5e,f) illustrate the
agglomeration of NGODs after adding Hg2+ (250 μM).
The added Hg2+ coordinated with the functional groups around
the NGODs and led to an increase in the size of the complex (several
metal ions aggregated numerous NGODs) with respect to the original
NGODs (ref to Figure 1a).

concentration (except Au3+ at 300 μM) and (b) corresponding
normalized graph at λem = 441 nm (F0 = NGOD PL intensity in deionized water and F1 = PL intensity with the metal ions). The selectivity
was additionally checked with Ag+, Mn2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ (ref to Figure S3).

deionized water after the presence of Hg2+ and Au3+ ions, and their corresponding (b,d) concentration vs intensity analysis

Au3+ are 0.954 and 0.995, respectively) and high-resolution
TEM images of before (e) and after the addition of (f) agglomeration
due to the formation of the Hg2+–NGODs complex.

The sensing system NGODs–Hg2+ can be modified
by the addition of small organic molecules.47 Although the recovery of the PL signal from the NGODs–Hg2+/Au3+ complex was tested with various compounds,
such as glucose (Glu), l-tyrosin (l-Tyr), l-Cys, and l-AA (Figure 6a), efficient recovery is observed only for l-AA and l-Cys case. For instance, the PL of NGODs was recovered
with an equimolar solution of AA in the NGODs–Hg2+ system (Figure 6b).
Nevertheless, it was observed that the PL intensity at 441 nm fails
to change with the addition of only l-AA to the NGOD solution,
indicating that l-AA did not affect the emission. The results
indicate that PL recovery of NGODs could be attributed to the redox
reaction between Hg2+ and l-AA. It is well known
that the diol group of l-AA is oxidized to an 1,2-diketo
group of the dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) along with the reduction
of the metal.48 In this case, the Hg2+ should reduce to Hg0 as proposed by Zheng.49 Hg(0) has much lower ability to chelate NGODs,
and the PL of NGODs can be partly restored (≈70%). All of these
results indicated that the NGODs/AA could develop an effective fluorescence
“on-off-on” sensor for the detection of Hg2+. By the way, the addition of l-Cys to the system-containing
NGODs–Hg2+ (quenched state) reveals that the relative
emission intensity will be restored being close to that observed for
NGODs in almost 90% (Figure 6b). This behavior has been observed in related systems and
has been attributed to the high affinity of Hg2+ for the
thiol group,50 which favors the formation
of the l-Cys–Hg2+ complex as described
by Zheng49 and showed at Figure 8. Thus, l-cysteine
separates the metal ion from the hydrophilic groups on the surface
of NGODs recovering the fluorescence. The PL signal intensity recovery
from NGODs–Hg2+–l-Cys/l-AA complexes is found to be very close to the original NGODs–l-Cys/l-AA PL intensity.

Figure 6 (a) Comparison of PL
recovery: PL intensity ratio before and after
the addition of 100 μM of l-AA, l-Cys, l-Glu, and l-Tyr (F1 and F2 correspond to PL intensities before and after
the addition of the PL recovering agents, respectively) and (b) %
regained PL at three different concentrations of AA and cystine.

Although the turn-off mechanism
is shown by both the metal ions
(Scheme 1), that is,
Hg2+ and Au3+, the recovery of the PL (i.e.,
turn-off-on) using l-Cys and l-AA is only observed
in the case of Hg2+. The absence of PL recovery (or reversibility)
after its annihilation in the presence of Au3+ could be
attributed to the strong characteristic bonding between the carboxylate
anions and Au+ ions. Upon the addition of l-AA
or l-Cys to the NGODs–Au3+ system, a redox
reaction takes place, that is, transformation of Au3+ ion
into Au+ ion (reduction) accompanied with a simultaneous
oxidation of l-AA to DHAA as schematized in the bottom part
of Scheme 1. Additionally, l-Cys can also be oxidized to disulfur derivative (R–S–S–R).
The Au+ ion has been reported to form stable complexes
with carboxylate ions;44 thus, Au+ ions are not removed from the surface of NGODs, and their presence
at the periphery inhibits the PL recovery (remains off).

Scheme 1 Schematic
Illustration of the Proposed Mechanism: Hg2+ Detection
and PL Recovery Using AA and Cystine (Upper Part of the
Schematic) and Au3+ Detection Using l-Cys (Bottom
Part of the Schematic)
As the variation in the order of l-Cys/l-AA and
Hg2+ addition in the NGOD luminescent probe system is found
to significantly influence the resultant PL signal, Figure 6b shows the effect of its addition
order at 3 different concentrations of l-Cys/l-AA,
for a fixed concentration (250 μM) of Hg2+. Although
the PL signal recovery in the NGODs–Hg2+ system
is attained by both the analytes l-Cys (blue bar) and l-AA (black bar), after the addition of Hg2+ in NGODs–l-Cys and NGODs–l-AA systems (i.e., reversing
the order of addition in NGODs), Figure 6b clearly shows the appearance of the turn-on-on
signal for NGODs–l-Cys and turn-on-off signal for l-AA (red bar), as the PL signal is retained even after the
addition of Hg2+ in NGODs–l-Cys (bluish-green
bar), which is on contrary to the case of NGODs–l-AA,
where the signal drops (red bar) to less than 50% (below the green
line).

Hence, after the annihilation of NGODs’ PL through
Hg2+, recovering the PL through l-AA reveals the
possibility
of having a reusable optical sensor (testing through repetitive additions
demonstrated in the following section). The recovery of PL intensity
in NGODs–Hg2+–l-Cys and NGODs–Hg2+–l-AA complexes, tested for 3 different concentrations,
corresponds to around 90 and 70%, respectively, revealing the independence
of the recovered signal with respect to l-Cys/l-AA
concentration. The detailed real-time PL measurements were carried
out to know the time taken to complete the reaction from turn-off
state to turn-on state (and viceversa) at different concentrations
of l-Cys/l-AA (Figures S4–S6), revealing the difference in the reaction time for l-Cys
and l-AA. Similarly, several citrus fruits tested for the
recovery of PL signal intensity and the analysis graphs of concentration-dependent
reduction of Hg2+ to Hg0 are presented in Figure 7 (PL spectra are
presented in Figure S7). Already reported
works related to PL recovery by l-Cys and l-AA are
shown in Supporting Information Figures
S8 and S9.

Figure 7 Comparison of sustainable PL recovery from Hg2+ detection:
PL intensity ratio before and after the addition of different concentrations
of various citrus fruits: (a) green lemon, (b) fanta lemon, (c) mandarin
orange, (d) tangerine orange, and (e) cotton candy grapes. The citrus
fruit juice was filtered using a filter paper and then diluted to
1/100 times with respect to the original concentration.

To further test whether our NGODs could be used
in a real environment,
the utilization of NGODs as a fluorescent probe to detect Hg2+ ions in tap water (TW) was examined with the water from three different
places within Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico. Three types of TW were
named TW1, TW2, and TW3. Similar to the results with deionized water,
decline/quenching and recovery of emission intensity at 441 nm was
observed after adding Hg2+ ions into NGOD-added TW (formation
of NGODs–Hg2+ complex) followed by the addition
of the l-AA to NGODs–Hg2+ complex (Figures S10 and S11). The values of F/F0 versus the concentrations of Hg2+ ions detection are plotted in Figure S9d. Therefore, in spite of the interference from various minerals
and contaminants existing in TW samples, the NGODs could still exhibit
sensitive detections as well as recovery of fluorescence response
toward the Hg2+ ions, suggesting that the as-prepared NGODs
are capable of detecting and recovering the fluorescence from Hg2+ ions in a practical environment system.

The above
observations open the possibility to use the proposed
system for designing the mimic devices using basic logic gates (NOT and OR).

Basic Idea of Logic Gates
Applied to the Optical Hg2+ Sensing System
The
basic logic gates (NOT and OR gates)
fabricated in this work use the characteristic PL emission response
at 441 nm (at λex = 344 nm) of the NGOD probe, upon
the addition of Hg2+ ions (quenching) and l-Cys/l-AA (recovery) as chemical inputs32 and the recorded variation in the PL emission as the output signal.
Hence, in the present system, the output signal symbolizes an “off”
state (with a Boolean arithmetic value of “0”), when
the value of the PL emission intensity from NGODs is less than 50%
and considered as an “on” state (with a Boolean arithmetic
value of “1”) when the emission is more than 50%.

Figure 8a–c shows the basic design of the two-input
logic operation system using NGODs, which can operate as two different
kinds of gates, depending on the metal ions and analytes (Hg2+/Au3+, l-Cys/l-AA), used as chemical
inputs. Boolean expressions 0/1 were treated as gate inputs with/without
the presence of Hg2+. As specified previously, the difference
in the emission intensities of NGODs (at peak wavelength 441 nm) was
choosen as the output signal for analyzing on and off states of the
system. The presence of the metal ion Hg2+/Au3+ as an input in the absence of its counteranion l-Cys/l-AA represents the system expressed as the NOT gate (input
A in Figure 8a), considered
as one of the simplest logic gates. Corresponding truth table is shown
as Figure 8b, where
“0/1” in the input represents absence/presence of Hg2+ in the probe solution (NGODs), results in an output “1/0”
representing the retention/quenching of the PL signal. Figure 8c shows the truth table corresponding
to the formation of the OR gate, where one of the inputs is the output
from the NOT gate (a system with/without Hg2+) and the
other is the analyte (l-Cys/l-AA) added to regain
the PL signal. Hence, different chemical inputs can lead to the formation
of four possible input string combinations: (i) (0/0), representing
the presence of Hg2+ and absence of PL recovering analyte;
(ii) (0/1), representing the presence of Hg2+ and PL recovering
analyte; (iii) (1/0), representing the absence of Hg2+ and
presence of PL recovering analyte; and (iv) (1/1), representing the
absence of Hg2+ and presence of PL recovering analyte.
Corresponding simulation results are presented in Supporting Information Figures S12 and S13.

of logic functions of NGODs with two
chemical inputs Hg2+ and l-Cys/l-AA and
(b) truth table for input A and output A (Al) with its
corresponding digital input and output signals representing NOT gate,
and (c) truth table for input 1 (from the output of input A) and input
2 (l-Cys/l-AA) strings with its corresponding digital
input and output signals representing OR gate, respectively. As conventionally
accepted notations, the 0/OFF state represents no luminescence and
1 represents luminescence. (d) Bar diagram representing the change
in the emission intensity of NGODs (chemical inputs were represented
as A = l-AA; H = Hg2+; F = off state and O = on
state, respectively) and (e) schematic representation of a KSL model
using NGODs as the molecular fluorescence system.

The annhilation of NGODs’ FL intensity due to the
formation
of the NGODs–Hg2+ complex, coincide with the NOT
gate, that is, off state. Upon addition of l-Cys/l-AA (input 2 in the OR gate), the PL intensity was recovered, with
almost 90 and 70% with l-Cys and l-AA, respectively.
Thus, an OR gate has been constructed using Hg2+ and l-Cys/l-AA as input 1 and input 2, respectively. The
presence of “turn-on state” in either one or both inputs
(input 1 and input 2 in the OR gate) in the system is expressed as
a turn-on state in the output. This clearly confirms that the decreased
emission intensity in NGODs–Hg2+ is recovered by
the NGODs–Hg2+–l-Cys/l-AA
complex formation. Thus, for future applications the proposed NGOD
probes can possibly be used as molecular/chemical logic gates for
the identification of Hg2+ in the real contaminated water
samples through PL switching pattern and the use of fruit juices as
recovering agents can be a step towards sustainable approach.

Security
Lock-Type Mimic Device or Functioning of Molecular
Logic Gates
The molecular/chemical computing (keypad lock)
system, as a modern strategy for information security, has been proposed/utilized
for restricted data applications.32 In
the present work, we have tested the possible incorporation of switching
behavior idea (used in electronic security devices) in the present
NGOD-Hg+2 ± l-AA system (Figure 8d,e). The PL emission signal difference represented
in the form of a keypad security lock (KSL) system is shown inFigure 8e. For using NGODs
as a probe in a security keypad sensing device for Hg2+, the PL probe (NGODs) was exposed to the molecular/chemical inputs
(Hg2+, l-AA) (NGODs–Hg2+, NGODs–l-AA). The hydroxyl groups present in l-AA will reduce
Hg2+ to Hg0, resulting in desorption of Hg2+ from the NGOD surface, leading to the off-on behavior. Thus,
although operating, if we add l-AA to the system containing
NGODs–Hg2+ (quenched state), the relative emission
intensity will recover to around 69 ± 2% (with respect to the
NGODs–l-AA complex system), which implies a turn-on
state, whereas if we added Hg2+ to the system containing
NGODs–l-AA (with the PL signal), the luminescence
decreases to almost 40%, which denotes the turn-off state. Thus, changing
the order of signal inputs, change in the output signals (PL intensity),
enables the usage of the probe (NGODs) in designing a molecular/chemical
keypad lock system. The lock can be removed (i.e., changing to the
turn-on state; Figure S9e vertical column;
H–A–O representing Hg2+ followed by AA resulting
in the on state) using the order of inputs as NGODs → Hg2+ → l-AA, whereas we can lock again (i.e.,
change to turn-off state; Figure 8e horizontal column; A–H–F representing
AA followed by Hg2+ resulting in off state) the device
using the order of inputs NGODs → l-AA → Hg2+.

In other words, in the crossword puzzles representing
security lock devices (shown in Figure 8e), the analytes (Hg2+ and l-AA) used in
the present case as chemical input signals, were named H and A (for
Hg2+ and l-AA, respectively), and existence of
PL signal (>70%) was interpreted as the output signal. The symbols
O and F represent on and off states, respectively. Although executing
the password, pressing H followed by A, the emission output will turn
the switch on (O), (turn-on state), pressing A succeeded by H will
cause turn the switch off (F) (turn-off stateFigure 8d). Thus, the password AHF will lock the
device, whereas the password HAO opens the lock without fail. The
corresponding simulation results are presented in Figure S14.

Mimicking Memory Devices
Due to
the observed switching
behaviour (the reversibility upon alternating the addition of l-Cys/l-AA
and Hg+2), the proposed structure/setup has been analyzed
for its possible usage as memory element in logic circuit for processing
information at molecular-level (Figure 9).

Figure 9 Reversibility of NGOD probe with the alternate addition
of (a)
Hg2+ and l-Cys, (b) Hg2+ and l-AA, (c) l-Cys and Hg2+, (d) l-AA and
Hg2+ (the concentration of Hg2+, l-Cys,
and l-AA was maintained at 250 μM), and (e) feedback
loops with write–read–erase–read function, (f)
sequential logic circuit of the memory unit, and (g) truth table of
the memory unit. In Figures (a)–(d), X-axis represents sequence
of addition.

After the addition of l-Cys/l-AA to the probe
NGODs–Hg2+ complex, different cycles of real-time
PL measurements reveal time-dependent change in the PL signal intensity
from the sample mixture containing NGODs–Hg2+–l-Cys complex (Figure 9a,b) and NGODs-Hg2+-l-AA (Figure 9c,d). As discussed earlier (ref to Figure 6b), the recovery
of PL signal intensity was observed. Although after the first addition
of l-Cys into the NGODs–Hg2+ complex (Figure 9a), there was a significant
change in the PL signal intensity, subsequent additions made no change
in PL intensity signal, indicating that the NGODs–Hg2+–l-Cys complex system is not suitable for the reuseable
memory device at this molar equivalent with respect to Hg2+. However, in the case l-AA, there was a noticeable change
according to the additions of Hg2+ in the probe system,
which means that the NGODs–Hg2+–l-AA complex can be used as a reuseable memory device (Figure 9b).

The addition of l-Cys/l-AA to the probe NGOD
solution (before the addition of Hg2+) reveals no significant
change in the signal intensity (Figure 9c and d). In the real-time PL measurements from the
sample mixture containing the NGODs–l-Cys–Hg2+ complex (Figure 9c) (even after 10 min) no significant change in the signal
intensity is observed whereas an immediate drastic decrement is revealed
in the FL intensity for the NGODs–l-AA–Hg2+ complex (Figure 9d). These results confirm the strength of NGODs–l-Cys complex as compared to NGODs–l-AA complex
where the former retains the PL and prevents the charge transfer even
after the incorporation of Hg2+. As per the PL analysis
(Figure S4), after the addition of Hg2+ to the NGODs–l-Cys complex, there is slight
decrement (i.e., ≈2% as compared with the original signal from
the NGODs–l-Cys complex) in the PL intensity; after
the alternative addition of l-Cys and Hg2+ to
the above system, there is no observable change in the PL peak intensity;
hence, it is acting as a turn-on-on sensor. In the case of the NGODs–l-AA–Hg2+ complex, there is around 60% decrement
(from around 90% of the NGODs–l-AA complex) in the
PL intensity, demonstrating the formation of the turn-on-off Hg2+ sensor in the case of the NGODs–l-AA–Hg2+ complex.

Furthermore, similar to the logic circuits
(implementation of Boolean
functions to store the information) demonstrated before, where they
can be controlled through one or more logic inputs (connected through
a response loop), for obtaining one output (identified as memory element
for the given inputs),32 in the present
case, for imitating the behavior of a memory element, chemical input
Hg2+ (input 1 is the output of NOT gate) is used as reset
and l-Cys/l-AA (input 3) as set (Figure 9e,f). The operation of Figure 9e is almost similar
to that of Figure 8a, except the use of memory element as an input to the AND gate.
The input of memory element is the previous output of the circuit
(i.e., the initial input to the memory element is “0”
representing an “off” state). Hence, four possible input
string combinations for set are (0/0), (0/1), (1/0), and (1/1). One
of the inputs (input 2; from Figure 9e,g) of set depends on the input 1 and memory element;
another input in set (input 3) strings 0/1 represents the absence
and presence of l-AA into the system.

Figure 9f shows
schematic representation of the “Erase–Read–Write–Read”
nature of the present system i.e., as a first step the addition of
Hg2+ to NGODs as a probe shows the quenching effect in
the PL signal intensity, which shows erase nature of the system. As
the second step, the addition of l-AA to the NGODs–Hg2+ complex shows the PL signal recovery, which signifies “write”
nature of the system. In between these erase and write nature, it
shows “read” nature representing the information that
was memorized, showing a continuous “erase–read–write–read”
cycle with alternative additions of Hg2+ and l-AA. The corresponding simulations were done and are presented in Supporting Information (Figures S15 and S16).
Hence, the proposed system can possibly be used as a molecular microprocessor,
that is, as a possible substitute for the conventional memory element
in ICs (integrated circuits).

Conclusions
Sustainable
reusable mercury sensing nanoprobes, synthesized via
hydrothermal treatment using citric acid as a carbon precursor and
urea as a nitrogen dopant, reveal the characteristic excitation wavelength
independent emission at 441 nm. Sharp XRD peak centered at 11.31°,
confirming the formation of NGODs, is attributed to the graphitic
structure with an interlayer spacing (001) of 0.78 nm. Highly fluorescent
NGOD-based sensing probes are found to be selective and sensitive
for the detection of enzyme-free H2O2 and label-free
Hg2+/Au3+ ions with the LOD of about 0.20, 0.20,
and 0.25 μM, respectively. The sustainable PL signal recovery
of almost 70%, after the detection of Hg2+ ions, is observed
using AA and naturally available citrus fruits. As compared to the
already reported PL recovery of the NGODs–Hg2+ system
through l-cysteine, where the PL signal recovers ≈90%
using double the molar equivalents with respect to Hg2+, 70% signal recovery through AA is achieved with equivalent proportions
of the corresponding metal ion. The fluorescent switching mechanism
has been attributed to the reduction of Hg2+ to Hg0 followed by its segregation from the sensing probe and hence
contributing to the recovery of the PL signal. In the case of Au3+, the absence of PL recovery (or reversibility) has been
attributed to the strong characteristic bonding between the carboxylate
anions and Au+ ions, formed because of the redox reaction
resulting in the reduction of Au3+ to Au+, accompanied
with a simultaneous oxidation of l-AA and l-Cys
to DHAA and disulfur derivative (R–S–S–R), respectively.
The proposed Hg(II) sensor was also tested and verified on real water
samples. Furthermore, the NGOD-based multiple logic gates were designed,
and their capacity of mimicking a memory device at the molecular level
with chemical inputs of Hg2+ ion and l-Cys/l-AA has been demonstrated. Such NGODs have possible applications
as molecular microprocessors, an alternative for the traditional memory
element in integrated logic circuits.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis
of NGODs
NGODs were prepared by the hydrothermal
method, using citric acid (0.2 g) and urea (0.38 g) (Sigma-Aldrich)
in wt. ratio of around 1:2, in 50 mL of deionized water (18.2 MΩ
cm), stirred (15 min), and kept in a Teflon autoclave at 180 °C
for 60 min. NGODs were stored at RT for further use.

Characterization
Optical properties, including UV–visible
and fluorescence spectra, of as-synthesized NGODs were monitored by
dual beam PerkinElmer LAMBDA 950 and Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer,
respectively. JEOL JEM-ARM200F was used to carry out TEM measurements
for determining the particle size distribution of the synthesized
NGODs. A 100 mesh Cu grid with a lacey carbon film was used for the
sample preparation by drop-casting of NGODs and subsequent evaporation
under ambient conditions. A Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer with Cu
Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) was used for measuring
the diffraction pattern. For surface-sensitive quantitative analysis,
Al Kα radiation photon energy (1486.6 ± 0.2 eV) from an
ESCA Ulvac-PHI 1600 photoelectron spectrometer was used. The FTIR
spectra of NGODs in the aqueous medium were measured using a Varian
660-IR FTIR spectrophotometer. Electronic circuit modeling was executed
using Proteus 8 Professional.

Selectivity and Sensitivity
Procedure
To determine
the relative selectivity of NGODs toward Hg2+, interference
studies were conducted on some common heavy metal ions in the presence
of NGODs (5 μL of NGOD’s stock solution in 400 μL
of 250 μM metal ion solution). The PL response of NGODs was
examined under identical conditions/concentrations of 4 mg/mL NGOD
solution with 250 μM Fe2+, Cu3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Hg2+, Ag+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Zn2+ ions, arsenic, l-Cys, l-AA, l-glutamic acid, glucose, fructose,
sucrose, and 300 μM Au3+. All of the heavy metals
and analytes were of analytical grade and used as received from Sigma-Aldrich.
Among these, Hg2+ and Au3+ show a significant
decrease in PL intensity with increasing concentration. Similar procedure
was used for the detection of H2O2. Then, the
PL spectra measured for recording the PL signal intensity.
