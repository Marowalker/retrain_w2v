For
a solid acid-catalyzed dehydration of biomass-derived carbohydrates
into useful furan derivatives, a suitable porous solid acid catalyst
having an optimum acidic density and its strength is required to avoid
cascade reactions in biomass conversion processes. A large-pore mesoporous
zirconium phosphate (m-ZrP) was prepared hydrothermally
using P123 as a template in water solvent, which resulted in a higher
pore diameter (>9 nm) having wormhole-like pore structures with
balanced
Lewis (L) to Brönsted (B) acid sites. The effects of calcination
temperature (500–800 °C) on the textural, acidic/basic,
and structural properties of the m-ZrP with its catalytic
performance for glucose dehydration to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)
were investigated in a pure water media as a green and sustainable
alternative solvent. The larger number of L and B acid sites and basic
sites with their appropriate strengths were clearly related with a
better catalytic performance in terms of glucose conversion and HMF
yield. The strong L acid and basic sites in the m-ZrP efficiently promoted the glucose isomerization to fructose,
which dehydrated exclusively on the weak B acid sites resulting in
a maximum conversion of glucose (83.8%) and HMF yield (46.6%). The
adjusted acidic and basic sites with large mesopore sizes make the m-ZrP yield a higher reaction rate (2.78 mmol gcat–1 h–1) and turnover frequency
(11.68/h) for conversion of glucose to HMF, which showed higher catalytic
activity than those of a small-pore m-ZrP and other
mesoporous heterogeneous and homogeneous acid catalysts.

1 Introduction
Global
warming due to an increase in CO2 emissions is
creating disastrous phenomena, and alternative renewable chemicals
and fuels have gained popularity due to their sustainability, low
contributions to carbon cycles, and lower emissions of greenhouse
gases.1 The use of CO2-neutral
biomass as a raw material represents an appealing solution with unprecedented
impact on energy security. Because biomass-derived carbohydrates are
abundant and widely distributed, the production of biofuels and fine
chemicals from carbohydrate biomass is expected to be more sustainable
than that of lipid biomass.2−5 The main drawback of carbohydrate biomass as a feedstock
for industrial application is the presence of excess oxygen (40–45
wt %) within the molecular structures.6 There are three methods, fermentative conversion, hydrogenolysis,
and dehydration, for removing oxygen from carbohydrate biomass, and
the dehydration method is one of the most attractive and promising
approaches because it directly converts the carbohydrate biomass into
furanic compounds without reducing the carbon atom number of the feedstock.4,7 Furan derivatives, namely 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural,
have been identified as key biorefining intermediates for the production
of biofuels, solvents, fine chemicals, polymers, and plastics.8 HMF is a more multifunctional molecule than furfural
because it consists of both aldehyde and hydroxyl functional groups
in a furan ring structure. HMF is also a good starting material for
the synthesis of precursors of dialdehydes, ethers, amino alcohols,
pharmaceuticals, and macrocyclic compounds.9 HMF and its derivatives listed as top 10 biomass-derived platform
chemicals10,11 are present in a variety of food sources,
especially in heat-treated foods, which has a calculated consumption
rate below 5–150 mg per person.4 However, HMF is synthesized mainly by the dehydration of the expensive
and limited fructose resource in nature that involves the loss of
three water molecules. These problems drive industrial attention to
utilizing the most abundant and cheapest carbohydrate of glucose (main
building block of biomass) for the HMF synthesis.12 As a result, the one-pot synthesis of HMF from glucose
has the considerable attention of many research groups.

The
one-pot synthesis of HMF from glucose is generally carried
out by the copresence of basic or Lewis and Brönsted acid catalysts,
wherein the glucose isomerizes into fructose on the base or Lewis
acid catalysts followed by fructose dehydration into HMF preferably
on the Brönsted acid catalysts. Therefore, the combination
of the basic and/or Lewis with Brönsted acid sites in solid
acid catalysts has been demonstrated successfully for the conversion
of glucose into HMF.13−17 For instance, one-pot HMF synthesis from glucose has been reported
over the combination of hydrotalcites (solid base) with Amberlyst-15
(solid acid) in the presence of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF);13 however, HMF
separation seems to be problematic during distillation steps due to
the high boiling point (153 °C) of DMF. Moreover, a number of
solid acid catalysts such as inorganic metal oxides, metal phosphates,
functionalized silica, zeolites, and heteropoly acids have been studied
to produce HMF from glucose in water, organic solvents, biphasic and
mixed solvents, ionic liquids, and supercritical water.18 However, the side reactions such as rehydration
of HMF to levulinic acid and formation of humins (arising from the
oligomerization/polymerization of glucose itself and HMF) were usually
reported during acid-catalyzed glucose conversion, especially in aqueous
media, due to unbalanced Lewis (L) and Brönsted (B) acid sites.19 Therefore, it is necessary to develop a suitable
solid acid catalyst having an optimal acid site density to avoid the
cascade reactions. Among the solid acid catalysts, metal phosphates
are well-known for their cooperation between L and B acid sites in
carbohydrate biomass conversion.19−21 Moreover, HMF selectivity
is well explained as a function of B acid site concentration and its
acidic strength.19−22

Among the family of metal phosphates, zirconium phosphate
(ZrP)
having an appropriate amount of B to L acid sites showed significant
activity for dehydration of fructose, glucose, and xylose in water,
organic, or biphasic solvents.19−21,23−27 However, the glucose conversion into HMF in the presence of exclusively
water solvent over ZrP has not been studied much until now. Because
water as a green solvent included in an original biomass has the ability
to solubilize both glucose and HMF, aqueous phase conversion of carbohydrates
to chemicals is a promising technique.15,28 Asghari et
al.23 found 72.3% conversion of glucose
with 23.5% HMF yield in subcritical water at 240 °C. Weingarten
et al.21 compared ZrP and tin phosphate
at 40% glucose conversion, where ZrP showed higher selectivity of
HMF (37.5%) than tin phosphate (23.9%). Therefore, the selectivity
of HMF, particularly in water solvent, needs significant further improvement.19,29 The catalytic properties of solid acid catalysts including ZrP strongly
depend on its textural, acidic, and structural properties, which in
turn are significantly influenced by its synthesis protocol.19−21,23,26,30 However, the surface area and porosity of
the synthesized ZrP is not satisfactory, and thus organic amines,24 cetyltrimethylammonium bromide,25 and Pluronic F12727 have been
used as a template to enhance the textural properties of ZrP. Although
the template-assisted ZrP exhibited an appreciable surface area (120–316
m2/g), small pore diameters in the range of 2–6
nm were reported.24,25,27 However, the mesoporous materials, particularly transition metal
oxides obtained using block copolymers (e.g., Pluronic P123), typically
showed a larger pore diameter of 5–14 nm than those achieved
with organic amines or ammonium templates.31,32 Hence, to enhance the pore size, we have chosen P123 and water to
synthesize mesoporous ZrP catalysts (m-ZrP).

In the present study, m-ZrP was prepared hydrothermally
by using P123 as a soft template using water solvent to introduce
larger mesoporous structures with high surface area for an easy diffusion
pathway of bulky carbohydrates along the balanced acid sites. To the
best of our knowledge, the synthesis of large-pore m-ZrP and its usage as a heterogeneous solid acid catalyst for glucose
dehydration into HMF via the one-pot synthesis method using exclusively
pure water solvent has not been studied so far. The effects of calcination
temperature on the structural, textural, and acidic/basic properties
of m-ZrP have not been investigated. The synthesized m-ZrP showed an excellent activity for the synthesis of
HMF from glucose in an aqueous phase using a green and sustainable
alternative water solvent under mild reaction conditions for an easy
separation of final products. The efficiency of m-ZrP catalyst after its recycle tests with the comparison of other
acid catalysts have also been addressed.

2 Results
and Discussion
Xu et al.27 studied
the influence of
phosphorus to zirconium (P/Zr) molar ratios for fructose dehydration
and found that the catalyst with a P/Zr molar ratio of ∼1 performed
with excellent activity in terms of both conversion and HMF yield.
Therefore, we initially selected the P/Zr molar ratio of 1.0 to study
the effects of calcination temperature (500–800 °C) on
the textural, acidic/basic, structural, and catalytic properties of
the m-ZrP catalysts.

2.1 Textural,
Surface Acidic, and Basic Properties
of m-ZrP
The pore size distribution curves
and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the m-ZrP catalysts calcined at different temperatures are shown
in Figure 1. The pore
size distributions of the m-ZrP catalysts, irrespective
of the calcination temperature, were found to be broader up to 100
nm (Figure 1) and revealed
the larger average pore diameters in the range of 9.9–13.7
nm by increasing the calcination temperature from 500 to 800 °C
(Table 1). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of all the calcined m-ZrP catalysts were almost identical (inset in Figure 1), which corresponds
to type IV for the characteristics of mesoporous materials. Both BET
surface area and pore volume were found to decrease with an increase
in calcination temperature (Table 1). It is worth noting that the m-ZrP
catalysts have improved the pore size (>9 nm) as compared to the
previously
reported m-ZrP, which has a lower average pore size
of 2–6 nm.24,25,27 This result clearly revealed the significance of usage of the structure-directing
agent of P123 for an enhanced mesoporosity of the m-ZrP, which seems to largely help for easy diffusion with an improved
selectivity of HMF.7

and N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms (inset) of the m-ZrP catalysts calcined
at different temperatures of 80–800 °C.

Because of the amphoteric nature of zirconia-based
catalysts,15 the amounts and strengths
of acid and basic
sites on the m-ZrP catalysts were determined by NH3- and CO2-TPD. Figure 2(a) shows a broad desorption profile of NH3 ranging from 50 to 540 °C for all of the m-ZrP catalysts. It indicates that a higher heat of adsorption of
ammonia over L acid sites compared to that over B acid sites due to
the copresence of those acid sites.19 The
solid acid strengths were not changed much while increasing the calcination
temperatures of the m-ZrP catalysts by revealing
the NH3 desorption at weak (∼130 °C) and moderate
to strong (∼300–540 °C) strengths of acid sites.
The m-ZrP catalysts also displayed medium and strong
basic strengths appearing at the separate desorption temperatures
of ∼300–380 and ∼620 °C as shown in Figure S1 from the CO2-TPD analysis;
however, significantly lower basic sites than the corresponding total
acid sites were clearly observed as summarized in Table 1. The concentrations of total
acid and basic sites, which correlate with the surface area of the m-ZrP catalysts, were steadily decreased with increasing
calcination temperatures from 1.25 mmol/g on m-ZrP-500
to 0.44 mmol/g on m-ZrP-800. It is well-known that
both L and B acid sites are required for the conversion of glucose
to HMF, and thus, the natures of the acid sites were distinguished
by FT-IR spectroscopy of the adsorbed pyridine (Py-IR). The Py-IR
spectra of the m-ZrP catalysts exhibited the characteristic
absorption bands at 1540 cm–1 for the pyridine molecules
coordinated to B acid sites and bands at 1448 cm–1 for the covalently bonded pyridine molecules with L acid sites (Figure 2b).20 The representative catalytically active B and L acid sites
on the m-ZrP catalyst are also shown in the inset
of Figure 2b. The coexistence
of another strong absorption band at ∼1490 cm–1 can be generally assigned to the combination of B and L acid sites.33 By increasing the calcination temperatures (mainly
from 600 to 800 °C) on the m-ZrP catalysts,
the concentrations of both B and L acid sites were found to decrease
(Table 1), although
the decrease of B acid sites was more than that of L acid sites, which
showed that L acid sites were stronger than B acid sites. The strengths
of L and B acid sites were further confirmed by varying the pyridine
desorption temperatures from 150 to 350 °C as shown in Figure S2. The L acid sites were observed to
be strong enough as compared to B acid sites because the former acid
sites, regardless of calcination temperature, were present even after
heating at 350 °C. The B/L ratios were decreased continuously
with increasing pyridine desorption temperatures from 150 to 350 °C,
although m-ZrP-500 and m-ZrP-600
catalysts retained their maximum acid sites (∼0.15) up to 350
°C in comparison with m-ZrP-700 and m-ZrP-800 catalysts as shown in Figure 3. It suggests the stable preservation of
the active acid sites on m-ZrP-500 and m-ZrP-600, which are responsible for enhanced catalytic activity as
well. The stronger L acid sites in the m-ZrP catalysts
could promote glucose isomerization to fructose, which can be dehydrated
exclusively on the weak B acid sites with an optimal acid strength
to maximize HMF yield.7 The B and L acid
sites calculated from the molar extinction coefficient method for
bands at 1540 and 1448 cm–1, respectively, are summarized
in Table 1. The maximum
B (∼0.034 mmol/g) and L (∼0.116 mmol/g) acid sites were
observed for m-ZrP-500 and m-ZrP-600,
which were found to be slightly smaller than the total acidic sites
measured by NH3-TPD due to the different proton affinity
and basicity of ammonia and pyridine molecules.33 A very lower amount of B acid sites in m-ZrP-800 (0.008 mmol/g) may be due to the surface hydroxyl groups
condensed (caused P–O–P bonds) at higher temperature.23 The results also showed that the amounts of
L acid sites, irrespective of calcination temperature, were significantly
higher (∼3–4-times) than those of B acid sites. The
B/L ratios on the m-ZrP catalysts also decreased
in the following order of calcination temperatures, 500 ≈ 600
> 700 > 800, as summarized in Table 1.

2.2 Morphology and Surface Structures of m-ZrP
TEM microscopic images of the calcined m-ZrP catalysts showing spherical morphology with aggregates
of particles (Figure S3). The particles
were found to have sizes in the range of ∼10–25 nm.
The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images displayed wormhole-like pore
structures (Figure 4a), which strongly suggests their highly amorphous natures.22 Similar wormhole-like pore structures were also
observed by CTAB-assisted synthesis of the m-ZrP.34 The HR-TEM results of all the calcined m-ZrP catalysts at 500–800 °C showed almost
similar uniform morphologies and porous structures. As expected, the
PXRD patterns displayed no distinct characteristic peaks of the Zr
and P crystallites by only showing two broad peaks in the 2θ
ranges of 15–40° and 40–70° (Figure S4). The crystalline phases for either ZrP and/or zirconia
are not observed in the PXRD pattern of the m-ZrP
catalyst even calcined at 800 °C, which supports the amorphous
nature of the framework walls of the m-ZrP.

Figure 4 (a) HR-TEM
images, (b) FT-Raman (i) and FT-IR (ii) spectra, and
(c) XPS spectra of the m-ZrP catalysts calcined at
different temperatures.

The surface phosphate species of the m-ZrP
catalysts
was differentiated by using FT-Raman spectroscopy. It is generally
accepted that the bending and stretching vibrations of phosphate groups
occur at 400–700 and 1000–1200 cm–1, respectively.35 As shown in Figure 4b(i), all calcined m-ZrP catalysts displayed one intense band assigned to the
stretching PO2 vibration mode at around 1040 cm–1 while merging other phosphate bands in the regions of 850–1150
cm–1 and another broad band at ∼440 cm–1 for the bending vibration of PO43–.36 The surface phosphate species seems
to be insignificantly changed when the calcination temperatures of
the m-ZrP catalysts increased from 500 to 800 °C.
However, the more intense peak at 1040 cm–1 on m-ZrP-600 suggests the well-developed zirconium phosphate
phases. The calculated PO2/PO43– ratios were on the order of 8.3 (m-ZrP-600) >
7.2
(m-ZrP-500) > 6.9 (m-ZrP-80)
> 6.8
(m-ZrP-700) > 6.4 (m-ZrP-800).
The
FT-Raman results were also confirmed by the FT-IR results. The FT-IR
spectra exhibited the broad bands centered at ∼1070, 756, and
537 cm–1 (Figure 4b(ii)). The band at ∼1070 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of the P–O–Zr
bond.37,38 After the calcinations of m-ZrP from 500 to 800 °C, the band in the P–O stretching
region (1000–1200 cm–1) shifted toward higher
wave numbers by ∼50 cm–1, which indicate
that the P–O bonds in the tetrahedron sites become more covalent
states. The presence of a weak band at ∼756 cm–1 corresponds to the asymmetric vibration of bridging P–O–P
(polyphosphate) bonds.34 The shoulder at
633 and band at 537 cm–1 could be attributed to
deformation modes of P–O–H and PO4.39 The band shifts at 1070 cm–1, and a relatively larger band intensity at 537 cm–1 can be possibly attributed to the generation of surface defect sites
related with the acidic characters, especially on m-ZrP-500 and m-ZrP-600, which are in line with the
results of FT-Raman analysis as well.

High-resolution XPS spectra
of the m-ZrP catalysts
showed the characteristic peaks for P2p, Zr3d5/2, and O1s
in their corresponding binding energies of ∼134, 183, and 532
eV, respectively. As shown in Figure 4c, no appreciable changes of surface properties of
zirconium and phosphorus species were observed when increasing the
calcination temperatures of the m-ZrP catalysts.
The presence of the P2p peak at 134 eV indicates that phosphorus existed
in a P5+ oxidation state on the m-ZrP
catalysts.40 The Zr3d consist of two peaks;
one intense peak at 183.4 eV for 3d5/2 and another peak
at 185.8 eV for 3d3/2, which were characteristic of Zr4+.41 The O1s peak might be fitted
by three components situated at binding energies of ∼529.8,
531.8 and ∼534 eV.40 The intense
O1s peak at 531.8 eV, irrespective of calcination temperature, corresponds
to oxygen combined with phosphorus; the broadness of the O1s peak
at a lower binding energy (∼529.8 eV) showed oxygen atoms of
the zirconia framework, and a higher binding energy (∼534 eV)
is for oxygen atoms attributed to carbon.40 The higher intensity of the O1s peak at 531.8 eV in all m-ZrP catalysts indicates that the O–P species is
dominant as compared to that of the O–Zr species. Interestingly,
the relatively larger peak intensity of 529.8 eV on m-ZrP-500 and m-ZrP-600 suggests the well-structured
zirconium phosphate phases compared to that of m-ZrP-800,
which were also supported by the results of FT-Raman and FT-IR results.
There were no significant differences in the surface atomic compositions
of P/Zr ratios before (80 °C) and after calcination (500–800
°C). Comparisons of XPS surface data with SEM-EDS could allow
for obtaining insights about the distribution of Zr and P elements.
As shown in Figure S5, the EDS pattern
at different positions confirmed the uniform distribution of Zr and
P elements by overlapping P peak with the Zr peak for all of the calcined
catalysts.37 In addition, the obtained
surface molar ratios of P/Zr are near 1 (Table 1), which fairly matched with the theoretical
molar ratio predetermined in the preparation procedures. We believe
that those well-structured amorphous zirconium phosphate phases are
responsible for the larger amounts of total acid sites with higher
B/L ratios on m-ZrP-500 and m-ZrP-600.

2.3 Catalytic Activity: Effect of Calcination
Temperature of m-ZrP
For the influence of
calcination temperature on the activity of the m-ZrP
catalysts to be studied, all catalysts calcined in the range of 80–800
°C were evaluated for the dehydration of glucose with water solvent,
and the results are summarized in Table 1. The conversion of glucose decreased with
increasing calcination temperatures. As-synthesized m-ZrP-80 displayed a higher glucose conversion of 90%, which decreased
to 70% with increasing calcination temperature up to 800 °C under
the reaction conditions with 0.1 g of catalyst at 155 °C for
6 h. In contrast, an increased yield of HMF was observed (43.2%) until
the calcination temperature of 600 °C (m-ZrP-600).
Upon further increasing the calcination temperature up to 800 °C,
a decrease in HMF yield was observed (32.7%) on m-ZrP-800 by showing a maximum HMF yield on m-ZrP-600.
On the other hand, the yield for fructose showed continuously increasing
trends from 4.0 to 7.2% with an increase in the calcination temperature.

Regardless of calcination temperature, trace amounts of undesirable
byproducts, namely levulinic, formic, and lactic acids and humins,
were also observed. The humins are both water-soluble and -insoluble
(both have been considered as humic substances). The color of the
final reaction mixtures was found to be pale yellow (Table S1), which indicates that a significant amount of black
humic substances was not formed under the reaction conditions employed.42 The quantification of these unwanted byproducts
and carbon mass balance was not fully achieved in this study. We assumed
that the yield for the organic acids may be significantly lower as
a very dilute concentration of glucose reactant (0.5 wt %) used in
this study, and thus, a lower amount of HMF available in the reaction
mixture can be used for further rehydration reactions.19 As per the HPLC peak area, however, the amounts
of the organic acids formed varied significantly according to calcination
temperature. For instance, the m-ZrP-80 resulted
in a considerably higher amount of lactic acid formation than that
of calcined m-ZrP catalysts. It is reported that
a preferential cascade reaction of carbohydrates in aqueous media
over L acid sites and the presence of P123 surfactant may result in
lactic acid.43,44 On the other hand, the m-ZrP-500 and m-ZrP-600 displayed an equal
amount of levulinic and formic acids, whereas the m-ZrP-700 and m-ZrP-800 exhibited a higher amount
of formic acid formation than that of levulinic acid. The formation
of organic acids, which was significantly varied with calcination
temperature, seems to depend on the structural and textural properties
of the m-ZrP catalysts besides the nature of acidic/basic
sites. The levulinic and formic acids may be produced from HMF rehydration
over B acid sites.22 For the cascade reaction
to be confirmed, a comparative experiment was carried out for the
fructose dehydration over homogeneous H2SO4 catalyst
under the same reaction conditions. We observed much higher yield
for levulinic (44%) and formic (13%) acids with very low HMF yield
(<1%), which confirms that the weaker B acid sites seem to be suitable
for a selective formation of HMF.

Many literature studies reported
that glucose can also be directly
dehydrated to HMF over B acids alone. However, the cascade reaction
(i.e., isomerization followed by subsequent dehydration) has a lower
activation barrier, and thus, it has been known to be faster than
the direct dehydration.7 Therefore, we
believed that the m-ZrP followed the cascade reaction,
whereby L acid and/or basic sites promoted the isomerization of glucose
to fructose, which can be dehydrated to HMF on the B acid sites. To
understand the structure–activity relationships, we have compared
the properties of the m-ZrP catalysts calcined at
500–800 °C. The larger variations in all structural, textural,
and acidic/basic properties as well as catalytic activity were found
by indicating the significant influences of calcination temperature
(Table 1). The correlations
between acidic characters in terms of L and B acid site concentrations,
B/L ratios, and activities on all the calcined m-ZrP
catalysts revealed that the glucose was isomerized into fructose and
is mainly catalyzed by the strong L acid sites, whereas dehydration
of fructose to HMF may be catalyzed by both B and L acid sites but
mostly weak B acid sites (Figure 5a). Besides L acid sites, glucose conversion was correlated
with the amount of total acidic and basic sites as well (Table 1). Furthermore, the m-ZrP catalysts calcined in the range of 500–700
°C exhibited a higher HMF yield (40–43.2%), which was
fairly correlated to both B acid site concentrations and B/L ratios
(Figure 5b). Although
the B acid sites of m-ZrP-800 were found to be much
lower, it also exhibited an appreciable yield for HMF (32.7%), which
may be attributed to the possibility of regeneration of some hydroxyl
groups via the hydrolysis of condensed P–O–P bonds in
water media.23 These results clearly indicate
a significant influence of the calcination temperatures of the surface
properties of the m-ZrP catalysts, and it can alter
the acid site concentrations along with total acidity besides the
textural and structural properties of the m-ZrP catalysts.
Though among all the m-ZrP catalysts the HMF yield
was found to be higher on m-ZrP-600, there was not
much difference in the conversion of glucose over m-ZrP-500 and m-ZrP-600. Therefore, m-ZrP-600 was selected for further studies to optimize the amount
of water, reaction time, catalyst concentration, and temperature to
achieve the maximum yield for HMF as well as glucose conversion.

and HMF yield with Brönsted (B) acid sites and (b) HMF yield
with B/L ratios over the m-ZrP catalysts calcined
in the range of 500–800 °C.

2.4 Catalytic Activity: Amount of Solvent and
Catalyst, Reaction Time, and Temperature
The dehydration
reaction of glucose was further studied with different water amounts
of 20, 30, and 40 g over 0.1 g of m-ZrP-600 catalyst
at 155 °C for 2 h. The glucose conversion was steadily increased
with an increase in the amount of water (Figure 6a). At 20 g of water, the conversion of glucose
was 47.2%, which was enhanced up to 60.7% by increasing the water
to 40 g. However, HMF yield was slightly decreased upon increasing
the amount of water that may be due to solvation effects.20 The reported studies revealed that exposure
of the solid acid catalyst to a polar solvent such as water can possibly
change the intrinsic nature of the acid surface due to solvation effects,
although L acid sites in aqueous media have still been well-known
active sites for isomerization of glucose to fructose.20 The conversion of glucose was significantly
higher at 40 g of water, and yet the HMF yield was relatively comparable
with the amount of water studied; thus, 40 g of water was chosen as
an optimum amount for the rest of the studies. It is important to
mention that organic solvents like DMSO and biphasic systems, namely
water/methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), showed a promising HMF yield
(>50%);18 however, complicated separation
of HMF from organic solvents and formation of aldolic products, such
as aliphatic ketone derivatives, from MIBK over acid-catalyzed condensation
reactions were reported as difficult and energy-consuming processes.45 For the disadvantages associated with organic
solvents and HMF-extracting solvents (i.e., MIBK) to be overcome,
pure water can be used as a green and sustainable alternative solvent
for HMF production, although it showed a relatively lower HMF yield.
As shown in Figure 6b, the reaction time variation study showed an exponential increase
in the conversion of glucose from 25.5% for 1 h to 80.2% for 6 h.
Similarly, a substantial enhancement in the yield of HMF was observed
by increasing the reaction time from 25.5% for 1 h to 45.1% for 5
h. However, because no further improvement in the yield of HMF was
observed after 6 h, all further experiments were performed for 6 h.

(b) reaction times, (c) catalyst amounts, and (d) reaction temperatures
using m-ZrP-600. Reaction conditions: glucose = 0.2
g. (a) time = 2 h; (a, b) m-ZrP-600 catalyst = 0.1
g; (b–d) H2O = 40 g; (a–c) temperature =
155 °C; (c, d) reaction duration = 6 h; (d) m-ZrP-600 catalyst = 0.125 g.

By increasing the catalyst amounts from 0.075 to 0.15 g,
the conversion
of glucose was increased from 70.8 to 87.8% (Figure 6c). Similarly, the HMF yield was also increased
from 41.5 to 46.1% by increasing the catalyst amounts; however, by
further increasing the catalyst amount up to 0.15 g, the yield was
slightly decreased to 45.3%. Therefore, further studies have been
carried out with 0.125 g of catalyst. A higher amount of the catalyst
increased the availability of acid sites, which favor the accessibility
of a higher number of glucose molecules to the acid sites and thus
enhanced the conversion and yield as well. However, at a much larger
amount of catalyst, some cascade reactions can possibly occur by further
reaction of HMF. The effects of reaction temperatures were studied
in the temperature range of 145–165 °C as shown in Figure 6d. The progress of
the glucose consumption and HMF formation was monitored by HPLC chromatograms
that was evidenced by a successive significant decrease of glucose
concentration (at ∼8.6 min) with a moderate decrease in the
peak intensity (at ∼35.9 min) assigned to HMF as shown in Figure S6. The results showed a significant increase
in glucose conversion from 59 to 92.6% with a slight decrease in HMF
yield (49.2–42.4%) by increasing the temperature from 145 to
165 °C. The yield for HMF was relatively higher (49.2%) at 145
°C, whereas the conversion of glucose was found to be lower (59%)
compared to either results at 155 or 165 °C. Nevertheless, at
155 °C, both glucose conversion (82.6%) and HMF yield (46.1%)
were fairly comparable to those obtained at 165 °C (92.6%) and
145 °C (49.2%), respectively.

2.5 Catalytic
Activity: Effect of Type of Carbohydrates
and P/Zr Molar Ratios
Besides the glucose carbohydrate as
a reactant, the production of HMF was also compared with fructose
and sucrose carbohydrates. The results showed the successive increase
in the conversion of fructose to sucrose (95–100%) under identical
reaction conditions (Figure 7). The increase in fructose conversion was mainly due to a
higher reactivity of ketohexoses (i.e., fructose) than that of aldohexoses
(i.e., glucose). The complete conversion of sucrose, a disaccharide
of glucose and fructose units, can be explained by the easy hydrolysis
activity of sucrose to glucose and fructose. These results are consistent
with those of previous reports in the literature.19,22,32 However, it is interesting to note that
the HMF yield from glucose (46.1%) is ∼2-times higher than
that of the obtained yield from fructose (23.5%). On the other hand,
the HMF yield from sucrose was intermediate (32%) to those of the
glucose and fructose reactants (Figure 7). The higher yield from both glucose and sucrose carbohydrates
can be attributed to the presence of the balanced B to L acid site
ratio of ∼0.3 on m-ZrP-600, which can favorably
catalyze glucose over fructose as previously reported by other researchers.19,22 Moreover, as we discussed earlier, the weaker B acid sites have
been known to be more selective toward HMF formation from fructose,
and the stronger L acid sites promote the degradation and polymerization
of fructose and/or HMF to unwanted byproducts, which resulted in a
very low yield of HMF from fructose. Under the same reaction parameters,
a comparative experiment of fructose dehydration over Lewis acid (ZrOCl2) confirmed the formation of black humic substances with lactic
and levulinic acids besides a very low yield for HMF (∼4%).
Glucose conversion to HMF involves an additional isomerization step
to fructose, which was efficiently catalyzed by L acid and basic sites.
Sucrose can be easily hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose units,
both of which are simultaneously dehydrated to HMF, and thus, HMF
yield from sucrose is intermediate to those of glucose and fructose.
Our results clearly envisaged that glucose could be converted to HMF
as efficiently as fructose if a suitable amount of B and L acid sites
are present in the solid acid catalysts. Thus, from an industrial
point of view, glucose as a feedstock, owing to its availability and
main building block of biomass, is more economical than fructose for
the production of HMF and other platform chemicals.

and their corresponding yields for
HMF. Reaction conditions: carbohydrate = 0.2 g; H2O = 40
g; m-ZrP-600 catalyst = 0.125 g; temperature = 155
°C; time = 6 h.

The effect of P to Zr molar ratio on the catalytic activity
of m-ZrP has been studied by varying the P/Zr ratios
to 0.75,
1.0 (previous reference m-ZrP catalyst), and 1.25.
As the L and B acid site concentrations were decreased with an increase
in P content, both conversion of glucose and HMF yield decreased,
which indicating that the acid sites of the m-ZrP
could be controlled by varying the P contents, although the B/L ratio
lies in a similar range (Table 2). The decrease of B acid sites possibly due to the formation
of a polyphosphate (P–O–P) group by sacrificing P–OH
groups and Lewis acid sites may be due to the domination of the O–P
species as compared to that of the O–Zr species.33,34 The phosphorus-rich m-ZrP catalyst (P/Zr = 1.25)
having lower L (0.087 mmol/g) and B (0.027 mmol/g) acid sites showed
a lower glucose conversion of 73.3% and HMF yield of 40%, which increased
to 83.8 and 46.6%, respectively, with a decrease of P content (P/Zr
= 0.75). The reference catalyst (P/Zr = 1) also had comparable textural
and acidic properties along with catalytic activity (Table 2) to those of the catalyst having
a P/Zr = 0.75. Figure S7 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (a), pore size distribution
profiles (b), NH3-TPD profiles (c), and pyridine-adsorbed
FT-IR spectra (d) of the varied P/Zr molar ratios after being calcined
at 600 °C. The isotherms of all three catalysts were observed
to be of type IV (Figure S7a), typical
for mesoporous materials. The BET surface areas of the m-ZrP catalysts were observed to decrease with an increase of P contents,
whereas the reverse trend was found for both pore volume and pore
diameter as well (Table 2). The pore size distribution of the m-ZrP catalysts
(Figure S7b) showed the presence of wider
pore distributions with a larger pore diameter in the range of 9.4–11.6
nm (Table 2).

2.6 Catalytic Activity: Reusability of m-ZrP-600
The reusability of m-ZrP-600 was examined by carrying
out consecutive recycle reaction
runs. After the reaction, the catalyst was separated from the reaction
mixture, washed 3 times with deionized water followed by with acetone
(∼40 mL in each time) to remove the adhered reactant and product
molecules from the catalyst surface and thermally activated at 500
°C before the next reaction cycle with fresh reactants. The small
quantity of formed humic substances was deposited on the catalyst
surfaces after the recycle reaction, which tended to become a dark
brown color (inset of Figure 8). As shown in the HPLC chromatogram (Figure S8), the catalyst exhibited a similar yield for HMF,
although the glucose conversion showed a slight decrease monotonously
from 82.6 to 74.8% until three recycle runs (Figure 8). The loss of activity may be due to the
changes of surface property of the m-ZrP, and thus
pyridine-IR and XPS were further analyzed. Pyridine-IR spectra of
the used catalyst (after 3 runs) showed the presence of both B and
L acid sites up to 250 °C (Figure S9a); however, an increase in B acid sites from 0.034 (fresh) to 0.079
mmol/g (used) and a significant decrease in L acid sites from 0.115
(fresh) to 0.03 mmol/g (used) were observed (Table 1). This observation suggests that the active
L acid sites converted to B acid sites in water solvent during the
successive runs. XPS spectra of fresh and used (after 3 runs) m-ZrP-600 catalysts (Figure S9b) clearly showed the peaks for P2p, Zr3d, and O1s; although the corresponding
peaks of used catalyst were observed at slightly lower binding energy
with broadness relative to that of fresh m-ZrP-600
catalyst.

glucose concentration = 0.5 wt %; catalyst = 62.5 wt %; temperature

2.7 Catalytic Activity: Comparison of Catalytic
Performance with Other Catalysts
Some heterogeneous mesoporous
metal oxides such as Al2O3, ZrO2,
and W/ZrO2 and representative homogeneous catalysts such
as H2SO4, H3PO4, and ZrOCl2 have been further tested for the dehydration of glucose to
HMF in water media with a view to compare the activity of m-ZrP-600 under optimized reaction conditions. The dehydration
of glucose over a series of selected homogeneous catalysts showed
significant variations in glucose conversion (Table 3). For instance, H2SO4 and H3PO4, which are strong B acids, displayed
lower conversions of glucose (9.3–17.7%) as well as HMF yields
(3.5–5.4%). On the other hand, the Lewis acid metal salt of
ZrOCl2 showed the highest glucose conversion of 98.5% with
a very low HMF yield (2.7%). The reaction mixtures obtained were found
to be dark-brown with black colors (Table S1), which indicates that side cascade reactions on the L acid sites
were more favorable. These results clearly confirm that the glucose
was converted efficiently by L acid sites, whereas the stronger B
acids (H2SO4) are not efficient for the glucose
conversion. The m-ZrO2, an amphoteric
metal oxide, showed a lower acidity (0.55 mmol/g) and thus resulted
in lower activity (36.2%) with HMF yield (12.4%), whereas m-Al2O3, Lewis acid, having 0.29 mmol/g
of total acid sites46 could slightly improve
both the glucose conversion (41.6%) and HMF yield (15.6%) (Table 3). The heterogeneous-catalyzed
glucose dehydration solution appeared to be a pale yellow to pale
brown color (Table S1). To confirm the
effects of pore size of the m-ZrP, we performed the
glucose dehydration reaction over the zirconium phosphate having two
different pore sizes at which the m-ZrP with a large
pore size of 10.9 nm exhibited the highest glucose conversion (82.6%)
with HMF yield (46.1%) than that of a small pore of 3.9 nm (72.1%
conversion and 31.2% yield). The activity variations of the small
(Figure S10a) and large (Figure S10b) pore m-ZrP clearly distinguished
the effects of mesoporosity on the diffusions of reactants and products.
The superior performance of the large pore m-ZrP
clearly indicated that the solid acids having a large pore size with
suitable amounts of B and L acid sites facilitated the easy diffusion
of glucose and HMF molecules under the present reaction conditions.
A similar observation was also reported by Dutta et al.37 The pore size distribution of the m-ZrP catalyst with small pores showed the presence of a narrow pore
size distribution with intrinsic mesoporous structures (Figure S11). Although a very low HMF yield of
3.9%, with lactic acid beside unconverted fructose (∼16%),
was observed on m-W/ZrO2, the L acid sites
of tungstated zirconia catalyst were reported to be highly stable,
being not diminished in aqueous media;47 thus, comparable glucose conversion was obtained. Representative
HPLC chromatograms of glucose dehydration to HMF on the different
heterogeneous mesoporous catalysts are shown in Figure S12. A plausible mechanism for HMF formation via fructose
from isomerization of glucose is demonstrated in Scheme 1. As shown in the inset of Figure 2b, the m-ZrP catalysts have both Lewis (Zr+) and Brönsted
(P–OH) acid sites; therefore, we believe that both acid sites
may take part in the reaction. The strong L acid sites of m-ZrP have the potential to initiate glucose isomerization
via an intramolecular hydride shift15 and
then stepwise dehydration of fructose to HMF on the weak B acid sites
as depicted in Scheme 1. It is also important to mention that the basic sites of the m-ZrP catalysts may also take part in the isomerization
of glucose into fructose via the proton transfer mechanism, which
was clearly described by Osatiashtiani et al.15

in Aqueous Media via Isomerization of Glucose to Fructose over Strong
Lewis Acid Sites (Zr+) and Stepwise Dehydration of Fructose
to HMF on Weak Brönsted Acid Sites (P–OH) of the m-ZrP Catalyst
The kinetic profile of the dehydration of glucose (Figure S13) showed a continuous decrease in the
concentration of glucose with reaction time. The glucose concentration
[glucose, mmol] was calculated by subtracting the consumed concentration
from the initial concentration of glucose substrate. The initial reaction
rate at 45 min (mmol gcat–1 h–1) showed the activity of the m-ZrP calcined at different
temperatures in the order of 3.26 (m-ZrP-500) >
2.78
(m-ZrP-600) > 2.16 (m-ZrP-700)
>
1.34 (m-ZrP-800), which were found to be significantly
higher as compared to the reported bilayer sulfated zirconia grafted
on SBA-15 (∼0.2 mmol gcat–1 h–1).16 Turnover frequency
(TOF) values were calculated by dividing the rates for HMF formation
by the total concentrations of B and L acid sites. The TOF of m-ZrP-600 was found to be 11.68/h, which was very high as
compared to the previously reported ZrP (1.62/h) and titanium phosphate
(1.08/h) for fructose and inulin dehydration48 and zirconia (4.7/h)49 and sulfated zirconia
(∼0.065/h)15 for glucose dehydration
in aqueous media. A higher TOF of 26.77/h was also observed over ZrP
(∼80% fructose conversion) at 3.35 MPa under a subcritical
water environment at 240 °C23 that
may be due to high reactivity of fructose besides the high temperature
and pressure. Though a low concentration of glucose with a relatively
higher reaction time was used in our study, HMF yield and glucose
conversion over m-ZrP in an aqueous phase were observed
to be higher due to its larger pore size and higher acid sites with
proper B/L ratios as compared to previously reported heterogeneous
solid acid catalysts such as Nb4W4,17 SnP,21 sulfated ZrO2 (S-ZrO2),15,50 Ti–Cl (TiO2 prepared from chloride precursor),50 TiO2 nanotubes (NT)51 or TiO2 nanoparticles (NP),52 and Nb2O522 or H3PO4/Nb2O5·nH2O53 as summarized in Figure 9 and Table S2. Overall, m-ZrP can
be one of the appealing catalysts for the environmentally benign synthesis
of HMF from glucose due to its high reaction rate with stability,
optimal acid sites of mesopores, and reproducible in an aqueous phase
using water as a green and sustainable alternative solvent.

solid acid catalysts compared with the present m-ZrP

from glucose.

3 Conclusions
Large mesoporous zirconium phosphate catalysts (m-ZrP) with wide pore size distribution up to 100 nm were prepared
by a simple hydrothermal method and calcined at 500–800 °C,
which were evaluated for the dehydration of glucose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF) in pure water as an environmentally benign green solvent. The
calcination temperatures of the m-ZrP catalysts have
significant influences on the textural, acidic/basic and surface properties
as well as the activity of the m-ZrP catalysts. Our
results clearly revealed the significances of the usage of P123 with
pure water resulted into the formation of large mesoporous structures
and more number of accessible Lewis (L) and Brönsted (B) acid
sites, which facilitated easy diffusion pathways of carbohydrates
and for HMF possibly as compared to the small pore m-ZrP. The m-ZrP catalyst having a higher concentration
of acidic and basic sites with suitable strengths showed a higher
glucose conversion and HMF yield. The study also revealed that glucose
can be converted to HMF as efficiently as fructose if a suitable amount
of L and B acid sites are present on the catalyst surfaces. The reusability
test of m-ZrP-600 (calcined at 600 °C) showed
similar yields for HMF until three recycle runs. Among the various
homogeneous (H2SO4 and ZrOCl2) and
mesoporous heterogeneous catalysts (Al2O3, ZrO2 and W/ZrO2) studied, the m-ZrP-600
exhibited the highest glucose conversion and HMF yield, which can
provide an efficient and sustainable process for both the catalyst
synthesis and production of HMF from glucose in water media.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of m-ZrP Catalysts
The m-ZrP catalysts
were prepared from aqueous
solutions of zirconium and phosphate precursors (zirconium oxychloride
(99%), Kanto Chemical Co.; orthophosphoric acid (85% in water), Duksan
Pure Chemicals Co.) using P123 (Sigma-Aldrich) as a nonionic polymeric
structure-directing agent. In a typical procedure,32 P123 (5 g) was dissolved in a solution of deionized water
(∼80 g) and orthophosphoric acid (∼5 g) under continuous
stirring. An aqueous solution of zirconium oxychloride (16.1 g) was
added to the above solution. The colloidal precipitate formed was
stirred at room temperature (∼23 °C) for 3 h. The whole
mixtures were then heated in a polypropylene bottle at ∼95
°C for 3 days. After cooling, the white material obtained was
filtered, washed thoroughly with deionized water, dried at 80 °C,
and calcined in the range of 500–800 °C. The resulting
white sample was designated as m-ZrP–T, where
T represents the calcination temperature (°C). The concentration
of the orthophosphoric acid was varied in the range of 0.025–0.075
M to obtain m-ZrP-600 with different phosphorus to
zirconium (0.75–1.25) molar ratios. Moreover, to compare the
catalytic activities, a small pore mesoporous ZrP (P/Zr ratio = 1)
was prepared with Pluronic F127 using the EISA process followed by
being calcined at 600 °C.37 The mesoporous
metal oxides such as zirconia (m-ZrO2),54 tungstated zirconia (m-W/ZrO2),55 and alumina (m-Al2O3)46 were also
prepared for comparative studies as described in the literature.

4.2 Characterization of m-ZrP
Catalysts
Specific surface area, pore volume, and average
pore diameter were obtained from N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms at −196 °C by a Micromeritics TRISTAR-3000 after
in situ pretreating the catalyst at 200 °C for 6 h. The specific
surface area and pore size were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively.

Temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) was used to estimate total surface acidity by a BELCAT-M instrument.
NH3 is a strong nonsite-specific base (pKb ∼ 5) that adsorbed on both B and L acid sites.
In a typical procedure, the catalyst was pretreated at 500 °C
for 2 h and then cooled to 50 °C. NH3 gas (99.99%)
was introduced to the catalyst for 30 min at a flow rate of 50 mL/min
followed by purging for 15 min. The catalyst was then heated at a
rate of 10 °C/min up to 700 °C, and the amount of desorbed
NH3 was measured. CO2-TPD was also carried out
to obtain basic sites on m-ZrP catalysts by following
the same procedure as mentioned in NH3-TPD. The Fourier-transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine (Py-IR) was also
used to differentiate B and L acid sites on the catalyst by a Nicolet
6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In a typical procedure,56 ∼30 mg of a thin catalyst pellet was
pretreated at 350 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min under
vacuum conditions. Subsequently, 5 μL of pyridine was injected
into the static vacuum system by using a microsyringe for adsorption
of pyridine to the catalyst for 10 min followed by desorption of physisorbed
pyridine for ∼30 min. The Py-IR spectra were recorded at different
temperatures after in situ heating from 150 to 350 °C. The B
and L acid site concentrations and B/L ratios were calculated from
the characteristic peak areas measured after pyridine desorption at
150 °C by the molar extinction coefficient method as described
in the literature.33

Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of the catalysts
were obtained with a TECNAI G2 instrument operated at an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of all
calcined catalysts were obtained using an X’PertPowder (PANalytical)
operated at 40 kV with a Cu Kα radiation of 0.1540 nm in the
diffraction range of 2θ = 5–70° at a scanning rate
of 4°/min. Raman spectrum of the powder catalyst was obtained
by a Bruker FRA 160/S FT-Raman spectrophotometer equipped with a 300
mW Nd3+:YAG laser emitting at 1064 nm. The Raman spectra
were recorded with 64 scans with a resolution of 4 cm–1. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer
Frontier IR spectrometer in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1. The electronic states
and surface concentrations of zirconium and phosphorus species on m-ZrP were recorded using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) with an ESCALAB MK-II instrument. The Al Kα X-ray source
having 1486.8 eV energy under a working pressure of 10–7 Pa with a resolution of 0.05 eV was adopted to analyze the Zr3d5/2 and P2p peaks. The binding energy (BE) of zirconium and
phosphorus species was adjusted with a reference BE of C1s (284.4
eV). The ratios of P/Zr were calculated to verify the surface concentrations
of zirconium and phosphorus species. The distribution of Zr and P
elements at different positions on m-ZrP were done
using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) combined
with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (JEOL, JSM-7600F).

4.3 Activity Measurement for the Dehydration Reaction
The dehydration reaction of glucose was carried out using a liquid
phase batch reactor. Then, 0.5 wt % glucose solution (a lower concentration
was taken deliberately to minimize humin byproduct formation) using
deionized water, and the required amount of m-ZrP
was charged in a 100 mL Pyrex glass vessel. The batch reactor was
purged with nitrogen, and reactant mixtures were magnetically stirred
at 500 rpm at a temperature of 155 ± 3 °C for 6 h. After
the reaction, the mixture was filtered prior to analysis on a YL9100
HPLC system (Young Lin) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column (300
× 4.6 mm) and a refractive index detector (RID). The column temperature
was maintained at 35 °C and 0.01 N H2SO4 solution was used as mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min.
Known concentrations of both glucose and HMF were used as standards,
and multipoint calibration curves were used for quantification. The
conversion of glucose and yield for HMF were calculated by applying
