A novel
glycosyl hydrolase family 11 xylanase gene, xynMF13A, was cloned from Phoma sp. MF13,
a xylanase-producing fungus isolated from mangrove sediment. xynMF13A was heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris, and the recombinant XynMF13A (rXynMF13A)
was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. The temperature and pH
optima of purified rXynMF13A were 45 °C and pH 5.0, respectively.
rXynMF13A showed a high level of salt tolerance, with maximal enzyme
activity being seen at 0.5 M NaCl and as much as 53% of maximal activity
at 4 M NaCl. The major rXynMF13A hydrolysis products from corncob
xylan were xylobiose, xylotriose, xylotetraose, and xylopentaose,
but no xylose was found. These hydrolysis products suggest an important
potential for XynMF13A in the production of xylooligosaccharides (XOs).
Furthermore, rXynMF13A had beneficial effects on Chinese steamed bread
production, by increasing specific volume and elasticity while decreasing
hardness and chewiness. These results demonstrate XynMF13A to be a
novel xylanase with potentially significant applications in baking,
XOs production, and seafood processing.

==== Body
Introduction
Mangroves are salt-tolerant forest ecosystems
that are situated
between terrestrial and marine environments of tropical and subtropical
regions.1 These ecosystems are considered
to be unique and dynamic environments because their geochemical characteristics
such as salinity, soil humidity, and nutrient concentration are cyclically
modified by periodic tidal flooding.2 Mangrove
forests are characterized by high biological productivity and are
the second most productive and rich marine ecosystems after coral
reefs.1 In mangrove ecosystems, close relationships
in the recycling and conservation of nutrients have been found among
soil microorganisms and plants.3,4 Mangroves have very
high rates of biomass production because they receive sufficient light
and have access to abundant nutrients from mud that is rich in organic
matter.5,6 Considerable amounts of leaf litter, twigs,
bark, wood, inflorescence material, and other detritus are generated
from mangrove forests and decomposed by the productive and diverse
microbial community living in mangrove sediments.6,7

Fungi are major components of the microbial community in mangrove
forests, playing important roles in the nutritive cycle that supports
the mangrove ecosystem.4 Moist conditions,
rich organic matter, aeration, and the low pH of mangrove ecosystems
favor a very high fungal biodiversity.8,9 Both culture-dependent
and culture-independent methods have demonstrated high fungal diversity
in mangrove ecosystems.9−12 Mangrove fungi play important roles in the early stages of organic
matter decomposition through the efficient production of a wide range
of extracellular degradative enzymes.13 Plant cell walls are the major organic matter in mangrove ecosystems;
cell wall hydrolysis is a complex process in which hemicellulose digestion
is the initial step, prior to cellulose hydrolysis.14,15

Xylan, the predominant component of hemicellulose, is composed
of a backbone chain of β-1,4-linked xylopyranose units with
substituted side chains at different positions.16 Because of the complex components and structure of xylan,
the synergistic action of several xylanolytic enzymes is required
to completely hydrolyze xylan. These enzymes include endo-1,4-β-d-xylanase, β-d-xylosidase,
α-d-glucuronidase, α-l-arabinofuranosidase,
and arylesterase.17,18 Among them, the most crucial
enzyme is endo-1,4-β-d-xylanase (E.C.
3.2.1.8), which randomly cleaves β-1,4-glycosidic bonds of the
xylan backbone and hydrolyzes it into xylooligosaccharide (XO) and
xylose. On the basis of sequence similarities of the catalytic domain,
135 glycosyl hydrolase (GH) families have been identified, with xylanases
belonging to families 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 43.18 The vast majority of xylanases are confined to GH families
10 and 11.

Mangrove fungi are of special interest because they
constitute
the second largest ecological group of marine fungi and are adapted
to extreme conditions, which make them a rich source for novel metabolite
and enzyme discovery.19,20 Xylanase activities have been
widely reported for fungi isolated from mangroves.21−23 However, few
studies of mangrove fungi have focused on novel xylanase gene discovery.
In this study, a xylanase-producing fungus, Phoma sp. MF13, was isolated from a mangrove sediment. A novel GH11 xylanase
gene (xynMF13A) was cloned from it and expressed
successfully in Pichia pastoris. Enzyme
characterization suggests that the recombinant enzyme, rXynMF13A,
is a salt-tolerant xylanase with potential application in baking,
XOs production, and seafood processing.

Results and Discussion
Strain
Identification
Using xylan as the sole carbon
source, a xylanase-producing fungus was isolated from mangrove sediment
of the Sankou natural conservation site. The 18S rDNA sequence (948
bp) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequence (571 bp)
of strain MF13 were compared with those in NCBI using BLASTn analysis.
The 18S rDNA sequence showed a nucleotide identity of 99.37% with Phoma herbarum (AY337712) and Phoma sp. sh1 (AB252869) and of 99.26% with Phoma sp. RMF1
(EF532930). The ITS sequences showed a nucleotide identity of 99.83% with Phoma sp. TMS-2011 (HQ630963), 99.65% with Phoma sp. 3TMS-2011 (HQ631000), and 99.13% with Phoma sp. 1OB-2014 (KM387394). The phylogenetic tree obtained
by applying the neighbor-joining method also identified the same classification
(data not shown). Thus, on the basis of the 18S rDNA sequence and
the ITS region sequence, the strain MF13 was classified into the genus Phoma and designated as Phoma sp. MF13. The genus Phoma is considered
to be one of the largest fungal genera, and many species have been
isolated from mangrove ecosystems.9,24 Diverse novel
metabolites and bioactivities (e.g., antihypertensives, antioxidants,
antithrombotics, and anticancer drugs) have been derived from mangrove-isolated Phoma species.25−27 Moreover, although xylanase activity
has been reported from isolated Phoma species,28,29 no reports have focused on novel
xylanase discovery from Phoma species
isolated from mangroves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report of gene cloning, heterologous expression, and biochemical
characterization of a xylanase from Phoma.

Gene Cloning and Sequence Analysis of xynMF13A
A fragment of 213 bp was amplified by using the CODEHOP
primers X11-F and X11-R. The 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences
amplified by thermal asymmetric interlaced-polymerase chain reaction
(TAIL-PCR) were assembled with known fragment sequences to give a
full-length xynMF13A of 749 bp. The cDNA of xynMF13A was amplified by xynMF13A-F and xynMF13A-R, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 696 bp starting
with ATG and terminating with TAA was identified. On the basis of
the alignment of the xynMF13A gene sequence and its
cDNA sequence, an intron, 53-bp long, was found that interrupts the
coding sequence of xynMF13A. The ORF of xynMF13A encodes a protein of 231 amino acid residues, including a putative
signal peptide of 19 residues and a catalytic domain of GH family
11. The theoretical molecular weight and isoelectric point of XynMF13A
are 24.42 kDa and 9.17, respectively.

The deduced amino acid
sequence of xynMF13A showed highest identity with
the following putative fungal xylanases: 91% with Ascochyta
pisi (CAA93120), 90% with Epicoccum
nigrum (OSS44936), 90% with Ascochyta
rabiei (KZM24001), and 82% with Alternaria alternata (XP_018385581). Moreover, XynMF13A showed 65% identity with xylanase Xyl5 from Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (AAK27974)30 and 63% identity with xylanase XYN-L4
from Pithomyces chartarum (AGV40651)31 and with XynZG from Plectosphaerella
cucumerina (ABA08462).32 On the basis of multiple sequence alignments of XynMF13A with three
characterized xylanases and four highly identical GH11 xylanases,
two putative catalytic residues (Glu125 and Glu216, known to be conserved in eight xylanases) were identified in XynMF13A
(Figure 1). Taken together,
these results demonstrate XynMF13A to be a novel xylanase belonging
to GH family 11.

Expression and Purification of rXynMF13A
The mature
protein coding gene of XynMF13A was cloned into the
pPICZα-C vector and then transformed into P.
pastoris X-33 competent cells. After induction with
methanol (0.5% every 12 h) for 120 h, significant xylanase activity
(about 20.1 U mL–1) was detected in the culture
supernatant of the positive transformants, demonstrating successful
expression of xynMF13A in P. pastoris. After purification by Ni-affinity chromatography, the recombinant
xylanase (rXynMF13A) migrated as a single band of approximately 27
kDa in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
(Figure 2).

Enzyme Characterization
Fungal xylanases are generally
neutral or acidic,33 and rXynMF13A has
a pH optimum of 5.0. It retained more than 80% of its maximum activity
between pH 4.0 and 7.0 (Figure 3a), with good stability. The pH stability profile showed that
purified rXynMF13A was highly stable from pH 5.0 to 10.0 and retained
more than 70% of its maximum activity throughout this range (Figure 3b). The majority
of known fungal xylanases are optimally active at mesophilic temperatures
(from 40 to 50 °C). For rXynMF13A, the optimal temperature was
45 °C when assayed at pH 5.0 (Figure 3c), and the enzyme retained 50% of maximum
activity when assayed at 30–50 °C. However, there was
a sharp decline at temperatures above 50 °C, with only 40% of
maximum activity being observed at 55 °C. Purified rXynMF13A
was stable at 40 °C and retained 89% of its initial activity
after incubation for 60 min (Figure 3d); however, at 50 and 55 °C, the half-lives of
the enzyme were approximately 5 and 2 min, respectively. Using beechwood
xylan as the substrate, the Km, Vmax, and kcat values
for rXynMF13A were 3.16 ± 0.33 mg mL–1, 2688.17
± 1.98 μmol mg–1 min–1, and 1075.27 ± 0.75 s–1, respectively. The
specific activity of rXynMF13A for beechwood xylan was 1322.82 ±
4.86 U mg–1.

3).

The effects of different metal
ions and chemical reagents on purified
rXynMF13A activity are shown in Table 1. Slightly enhanced enzyme activity was observed in
the presence of 5 mM Ag+, Zn2+, Fe3+, or Li+. However, in the presence of 5 mM Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, or Fe2+, the activity
of rXynMF13A decreased to 60–80% of its initial activity. Mn2+ or Hg2+ (5 mM) significantly inhibited the activity
of rXynMF13A. The remaining metal ions had little or no effect. Unlike
most xylanases, whose activity is usually enhanced by β-mercaptoethanol,34 the activity of rXynMF13A was completely inhibited
by 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. SDS is an anionic detergent and a
strong denaturant that inhibits most xylanases at a low concentration.34,35 In contrast, rXynMF13A showed good resistance to SDS.

Effect of NaCl on the Activity
and Stability of rXynMF13A
Salt-tolerant xylanases are usually
isolated from microorganisms
found in marine or saline environments, and such xylanases have potential
applications in seafood processing.35−37 One geochemical characteristic
of mangroves is high salinity. The effect of salt on the activity
and stability of XynMF13A was determined given that it contains a
putative signal peptide, which suggests its potential segregation.
Purified rXynMF13A showed excellent tolerance to various concentrations
of NaCl and was very stable at high NaCl concentrations. It exhibited
maximal activity (105%) in 0.5 M NaCl, which is approximately equivalent
to the salinity of seawater (Figure 4a), and it retained approximately 54% of its activity
in 4 M NaCl. Moreover, purified rXynMF13A showed strong tolerance
to sustained exposure to these high concentrations of NaCl, retaining
more than 92 and 72% xylanase activity after incubation with 3 or
4 M NaCl, respectively, at 37 °C for 1 h (Figure 4b). Salt-tolerant proteins have been shown
previously to have a high ratio of acidic to basic amino acids, with
a deficiency of hydrophobic amino acids.38 Amino acid sequence analysis of XynMF13A revealed a low ratio of
acidic to basic amino acids (4.3% vs 6.5%). However, there was a high
ratio of polar (70.1%) to nonpolar amino acids (29.9%). These results
were similar to those for the GH11 xylanase from the marine isolate, Bacillus subtilis cho40.37 Further, the ratio of acidic amino acids of the two salt-tolerant
GH11 xylanases was much lower than that for the salt-tolerant GH10
xylanases (Table 2).
The reason for salt tolerance by xylanases is unknown and requires
more investigation at the structural level.

Hydrolysis Product Analysis
One of the most important
xylanase applications is the production of XOs from agricultural wastes
(e.g., corncobs, rice hulls, straw, bran, and bagasse), which have
a high content of xylan.39,40 XOs are particularly
important as food additives, in feed formulations, and in pharmaceuticals.39 XOs are not carcinogenic, are low in caloric
content, have good thermal properties, and are pH-stable.41 Hence, rXynMF13A was assessed for its ability
to produce XOs by hydrolysis of corncob xylan. Hydrolytic products
were separated and detected by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (Figure 5). The main hydrolytic
products were xylobiose (X2), xylotriose (X3), xylotetraose (X4),
and xylopentaose (X5) with a small amount of other XOs that had a
low degree of polymerization (DP). No xylose was found. With increased
time of hydrolysis, the amount of each type of XOs increased but their
relative amounts remained essentially unchanged. These results demonstrate
rXynMF13A to be a strict endo-β-1,4-xylanase.
It is important to note that hundreds of xylanases have been characterized,
but only a few hydrolyze xylan into XOs with low DP and without producing
xylose.35,42 The rXynMF13A hydrolysis products from corncob
xylan are mainly XOs with a DP from two to five, demonstrating its
potential application for the production of XOs from corncob xylan.

(lanes 2), 1 h (lanes 3), 4 h (lanes 3), and 10 h (lanes 5).

Effect of rXynMF13A on
Chinese Steamed Bread Quality
Another important food-industry
application for xylanase is baking.16,18 Xylanase is
added to bread formulas to increase bread volume and
thus improve bread quality.43,44 In China, about 40%
wheat flour is used to make Chinese steamed bread (CSB), a traditional
food with a history of hundreds of years.45 However, only a few studies have focused on the use of xylanases
for CSB. For example, XynA from Streptomyces sp. FA146 and a thermostable xylanase
from Chaetomium sp.47 have positive effects on CSB, increasing specific volume
and decreasing firmness. In this study, three concentrations of rXynMF13A
were assessed for their effect on the quality of CSB and compared
to a control condition in which no xylanase was added. As shown in Table 3, with increasing
enzyme concentration, rXynMF13A improved CSB specific volume and elasticity
while decreasing hardness and chewiness of CSB. The specific volume
of CSB, with different concentrations of rXynMF13A, was higher than
that of the control. When 0.75 U g–1 rXynMF13A was
used, the specific volume was 0.109 higher than that of the control,
that is, 4.45% higher. With the addition of 0.75 U g–1 xylanase, CSB hardness and chewiness decreased by 25.7 and 25.2%,
respectively, when compared to the control. These results suggest
that rXynMF13A has beneficial effects on the quality of CSB. Hence,
this xylanase could be combined effectively with other enzymes such
as α-amylase, cellulase, and glucose oxidase to improve CSB.48

Conclusions
In this study, a novel
GH11 xylanase gene (xynMF13A) was cloned from a mangrove
fungus and expressed in P. pastoris, and the resultant expressed protein
was purified and characterized. The results demonstrate XynMF13A to
be a salt-tolerant enzyme, with a high degree of salt resistance up
to 4 M NaCl. Hydrolysis products generated from corncob xylan by this
xylanase are mainly xylobiose, xylotriose, xylotetraose, and xylopentaose,
though no xylose was found. Furthermore, XynMF13A had a beneficial
effect on CSB by improving specific volume and elasticity while at
the same time decreasing hardness and chewiness. Hence, XynMF13A is
a novel xylanase with excellent potential for both basic research
and industrial applications.

Xylanase-Producing Fungi Isolation
Mangrove sediments
were sampled from Shankou Mangrove National Nature Reserve in Beihai
city, Guangxi province, China (29° 50′ 32″ N, 109°
45′ 36″ E). One gram of sediment was suspended in sterilized
water and diluted stepwise to concentrations of 10–1, 10–2, 10–3, and 10–4. Subsequently, 0.1 mL of each diluted soil suspension was spread
onto screening agar plates containing 0.5% (w/v) beechwood xylan,
0.5% (w/v) peptone, and metal salts (0.1% KNO3, 0.05% K2HPO4, 0.05% MgSO4, 0.05% NaCl, and 0.05%
FeSO4). After incubation at 25 °C for 2–3 d,
one of the fast-growing fungal colonies (identified as MF13) was separately
transferred to fresh screening agar plates for further purification.
The strain MF13 was identified by PCR amplification and sequencing
of the 18S rDNA and intergenic region sequence (ITS) of ribosomal
DNA, as described elsewhere.49

Full-Length

were excised, purified, cloned into the pMD18-T vector, and then sequenced.
The complete sequences were assembled from the known fragment sequences
using Vector NTI 10.3 (InforMax, USA).

was extracted and purified from the mycelia of MF13 grown in potato
dextrose liquid medium containing 0.5% xylose by using an RNeasy Plant
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using a TransScript
One-Step gDNA Removal and cDNA Synthesis SuperMix kit (TransGen Biotech,
Beijing, China).

Cloning of xynMF13A from
cDNA and Sequence
Analysis
The full-length cDNA of xynMF13A was amplified by PCR using the specific primers xynMF13A-F and xynMF13A-R (Table 4) and sequenced by Invitrogen. Identification
of the ORF was performed using Vector NTI 10.3 (InforMax, MD, USA),
and the putative signal peptide was predicted using SingalP 4.1 Server
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/).52 The DNA and protein sequence similarities
were assessed using BLASTn and BLASTp programs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).

Expression and Purification of XynMF13A in P.
pastoris
The XynMF13A coding sequence without
the predicted signal peptide was amplified by using primers xynMF13A-m-F and xynMF13A-m-R (Table 4). The PCR product
was digested with EcoR I and Xba I and inserted into vector pPICZα-C with in-frame fusion of
the α-factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to construct the recombinant plasmids. The recombinant clones were
selected on low-salt lysogeny broth agar plates containing 100 μg
mL–1 zeocin and confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing.
The recombinant plasmid, pPIC-xynMF13A, was linearized
with Pme I and transformed into P.
pastoris X-33 competent cells by electroporation using
a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Positive transformants
were screened on yeast extract peptone dextrose sorbitol plates (1%
yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 1 M sorbitol, and 1.5% agar)
containing 100 μg mL–1 zeocin. Positive colonies
with strong resistance to zeocin were transferred to buffered glycerol
complex medium (BMGY: 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 100 mM pH 6.0
potassium phosphate, 1.34% YNB, 4 × 10–5% biotin,
and 1% glycerol) and grown at 30 °C for 48 h. The cells were
harvested by centrifugation, suspended in buffered methanol complex
medium (BMMY: 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 100 mM pH 6.0 potassium
phosphate, 1.34% YNB, 4 × 10–5% biotin, and
0.5% methanol), and cultured at 30 °C for 120 h. Methanol (0.5%)
was added to cultures every 24 h for the purpose of induction. Samples
were withdrawn at intervals, and supernatant xylanase activity was
measured, as described below.

To purify the His-tagged recombinant
protein (rXynMF13A), culture supernatants were collected after centrifugation
(13 000g, 4 °C for 5 min) and concentrated
by using an ultrafiltration membrane (PES5000, Sartorius Stedim Biotech,
Göttingen, Germany). The concentrate containing rXynMF13A was
loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA agarose gel column and washed with
a linear imidazole gradient of 20–200 mM in Tris-HCl buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.6). The purity and
apparent molecular mass of the purified rXynMF13A were estimated by
SDS-PAGE (12.0% running gel). The protein concentration of the purified
rXynMF13A was determined using an EsayII-BCA Protein Quantitative
Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China), using bovine serum albumin
as the standard.

Xylanase Activity Assay
Xylanase
activity was determined
by measuring the release of reducing sugar from substrates, using
the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method.53 The reaction mixture contained 0.1 mL of appropriately diluted enzyme
and 0.9 mL of McIlvaine buffer (pH 5.0) containing 1% (w/v) beechwood
xylan as the substrate. After incubation at 45 °C for 10 min,
1.5 mL of DNS reagent was immediately added to stop the reaction and
the mixture was boiled for 5 min. When the reaction mixture had cooled
to room temperature, the presence of reducing sugars was determined
spectrophotometrically at 540 nm. The amount of reducing sugars was
estimated based on the linear portion of an equivalent xylose standard
curve. One unit (U) of xylanase activity was defined as the amount
of enzyme that released 1 μmol of reducing sugar equivalent
to xylose per min. Enzyme activity was measured by this procedure
unless otherwise noted. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Biochemical Characterization
Beechwood xylan was used
as the substrate for enzyme characterization. The optimal pH of purified
rXynMF13A activity was determined at 37 °C in buffers of pH range
3.0–11.0. McIlvaine buffer (0.2 M Na2HPO4/0.1 M citric acid) was used for pH 3.0–7.0, 0.1 M Tris-HCl
for pH 7.0–9.0, and glycine–NaOH for pH 9.0–11.0.
For the pH stability assay, the appropriate dilution of purified rXynMF13A
was incubated in buffer at pH 3.0–11.0 at 37 °C for 1
h, and the residual enzyme activity was measured at pH 5.0 and 45
°C. The initial activity of rXynSL3 was set as 100%.

The
optimal temperature of purified rXynMF13A was determined over temperature
ranges of 10–60 °C in McIlvaine buffer (pH 5.0). The thermostability
of rXynMF13A was determined by measuring the residual activity after
preincubation of the enzyme in McIlvaine buffer (pH 6.0) at 40, 45,
50, and 55 °C without substrate for various time periods.

The Km, Vmax, and kcat values for XynMF13A were determined
in McIlvaine buffer (pH 5.0) containing 1–10 mg mL–1 beechwood xylan and 0.1 mL of enzyme solution (2.56 U mL–1) at 45 °C. Km and Vmax were determined by using the nonlinear regression
computer program GraFit (Erithacus, Horley, Surrey, UK).

The
effects of different metal ions and chemical reagents on purified
rXynSL3 activity were measured at 37 °C in McIlvaine buffer (pH
5.0) containing, separately, 5 mM (final concentration) LiCl, NaCl,
KCl, AgCl, CaCl2, CoCl2, HgCl2, FeCl3, CrCl3, MnSO4, ZnSO4, MgSO4, NiSO4, CuSO4, FeSO4, Pb(CH3COO)2, EDTA, SDS, and β-mercaptoethanol.
Purified rXynSL3, without any additive, was used as a control, and
its activity was set as 100%.

The effect of NaCl on purified
rXynMF13A was determined at 45 °C
in McIlvaine buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.25–4.0 M NaCl. To
examine its resistance to salt, rXynMF13A was incubated with 3 or
4 M NaCl at 37 °C for 1 h, and the residual enzyme activity was
measured in McIlvaine buffer (pH 5.0) at 45 °C.

Hydrolysis
Products Generated from Corncob Xylan by rXynMF13A
Purified
rXynMF13A was mixed with 1% (w/v) of corncob xylan in
McIlvaine buffer (pH 5.0) and incubated at 45 °C for 8 h. Hydrolysis
products were analyzed by TLC using silica gel G-60 and developed
in a solvent system consisting of butanol, ethanol, and water (5:3:2,
v/v/v). Carbohydrate products were visualized by spraying with a mixture
of 1% (v/v) aniline, 1% (w/v) diphenylamine, and 5% (v/v) phosphoric
acid in acetone. Xylose, xylobiose, xylotriose, xylotetraose, and
xylopentaose were used as standards.

Application of rXynMF13A
for CSB Making
The recipe
for CSB is 100 g of wheat flour, 0.8 g of dehydrated yeast, 0.8 g
of NaCl, 10 g of sugar, and 48 mL of water. A mixture of dehydrated
yeast and rXynMF13A was dissolved in 37 °C water before making
the dough. The effect of xylanase was studied by adding rXynMF13A
in dosages of 250, 500, and 750 U kg–1 flour. After
mixing and kneading, the dough was sheeted 30 times. The dough was
then rounded, placed in a mold, and proved for 1 h at 37 °C and
80% relative humidity. The proved dough was steamed for 20 min using
a steam tray and boiling water. The control sample was prepared as
described above, but without adding xylanase.

The quality of
CSB was evaluated by determining its weight, volume, hardness, elasticity,
and chewiness. Loaf volume measurements were taken using the rapeseed
displacement method after 2 h of steaming. Specific volume (the volume
to the weight, mL g–1) was calculated as the ratio
of volume to weight of the loaf. The hardness, elasticity, and chewiness
were determined using a texture analyzer (TA-XT plus) and Texture
Expert software. The TPA mode was used, and the test conditions were
as follows: test speed, 1 mm/s; trigger type, auto; tare mode, auto;
trigger force, 5 g; distance, 10.0 mm; and time, 10.00 s.
