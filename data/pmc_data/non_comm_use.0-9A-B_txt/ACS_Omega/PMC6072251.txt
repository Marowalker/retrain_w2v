Removal
of oral biofilms involves the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials,
which eradicate both pathogenic and protective oral commensal species.
Ideal therapeutics for dental caries should be able to selectively
inhibit pathogenic biofilms caused by Streptococcus
mutans. S. mutans extracellular
glucosyltransferases (Gtfs), particularly GtfB and GtfC, synthesize
predominantly water-insoluble glucans, which contribute to the structural
scaffold of biofilms. The lead stilbene identified through our docking
study against the catalytic domain of GtfC is a natural product known
as piceatannol, which inhibited S. mutans biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner, with considerable
selectivity over growth inhibition of S. mutans and commensal streptococci. Binding kinetic analysis of piceatannol
was performed using Octet RED against both GtfB and GtfC, which produced
low micromolar KD values. Piceatannol
inhibited S. mutans colonization in
an in vivo drosophila model and a rat model of dental caries.

Introduction
Causative relationships between Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and dental caries have
been established over the years.1 As the
primary etiological agent, S. mutans has developed multiple mechanisms to integrate into the dental biofilm
(plaque) to colonize tooth surfaces. One of the prominent pathways
is initiated when S. mutans produces
glucans, high-molecular-weight sticky glucosyl polymers, via glucosyltransferases
(Gtfs) and adheres to the tooth surfaces, which then trap other oral
bacteria, food debris, and salivary components to create a cariogenic
biofilm environment.2

S. mutans possesses three Gtfs,
which are products of gtfB, gtfC, and gtfD genes; GtfB synthesizes
mostly insoluble glucans containing more of α-1,3-linked glucans
and GtfC synthesizes a mixture of soluble and insoluble glucans, whereas
GtfD synthesizes predominantly soluble glucans (containing more α-1,6-linked
glucans).3,4 Previous work in this field has revealed
that the deletion of gtfB and gtfC genes in S. mutans markedly disrupted microcolony formation and biofilm formation.5 Biological and immunochemical properties of both
these enzymes are very similar. Genes encoding GtfB and GtfC lie next
to each other, have 76% amino acid sequence homology, and are subject
to similar regulatory processes.6−8 Therefore, GtfB and GtfC are valid
targets for the structure-based discovery of S. mutans biofilm inhibitors.

Current approaches to eradicate dental
biofilms include its mechanical
removal and the use of nonspecific broad-spectrum antibiotics.9 The removal of bacterial biofilms through brushing
demands frequent repetition because the tooth surfaces are rapidly
recolonized.10 Similarly, antimicrobial
agents in mouthwashes such as chlorhexidine and delmopinol lack selectivity,
affecting both pathogenic species and commensal beneficial species,
and give rise to undesired side effects such as vomiting, diarrhea,
addiction, or teeth discoloration.9

Numerous natural products and their derivatives have been investigated
for their potential to inhibit cariogenic plaque formation. These
include constituents found in cranberry, plant lectins, crude extracts
of Morus alba leaves, and components
found in barley coffee.11,12 Most of the reported
studies suggest these agents to be effective against biofilm formation
of S. mutans through varying degrees
of regulation of Gtfs.11,13 In addition, several small molecules,
including anthraquinones,14 apigenin,15,16tt-farnesol,17,18 chitosan,19 7-epiclusianone,20,21 α-mangostin,22 myricetin,23,24 and honokiol25 have been characterized and shown to have antibiofilm
activity toward S. mutans. However,
the majority of these compounds do not exhibit high selectivity against S. mutans biofilms. Chemical structures of a few
of these natural products are given in Figure 1.

Prior studies have indicated
that resveratrol inhibits glycolytic
acid production and Gtf activity of S. mutans, when tested using an ethyl acetate extract from Pediomelum cuspidatum root, which is composed of
polydatin, resveratrol, anthraglycoside B, and emodin.26−28 Our laboratory has a long-standing interest in developing selective
anti-biofilm agents that target S. mutans virulence,29 and we have recently explored
the effect of small molecules against S. mutans biofilms and developed Gtf-selective inhibitors.30−32 Nevertheless,
there are no reports related to stilbene’s possible effect
on the virulence of dental biofilms. Because of the promise demonstrated
by polyphenols in the inhibition of Gtf and the ability of S. mutans to assemble biofilms, in the present study,
we have performed in silico docking on natural and synthetic polyphenols
against the X-ray crystal structure33 of
GtfC’s catalytic domain active site and have successfully identified
low micromolar inhibitors of both glucan production and S. mutans biofilm formation.

Results and Discussion
Structure-Based
Virtual Screening of Natural Polyphenols
The three-dimensional
(3D) crystal structure of GtfC in the complex
with acarbose has been successfully employed to develop Gtf-selective
inhibitors.33 We thus performed in silico
docking, using FlexX/LeadIT software package, on a database of compounds
containing at least one phenolic group against the high-resolution
X-ray crystal structure of GtfC (PDB code: 3AIC).33 Top scoring
compounds were examined for their binding interactions with key residues
such as Glu515, Ala478, Tyr430, Asp959, Leu333, Gln960, Asp477, and
Asp588, druglike properties based on Lipinski’s rules, and
synthetic feasibility.

Inhibition of S. mutans Biofilms
by Natural and Synthetic Stilbenes
Stilbenes obtained from
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) were first evaluated for their
biofilm inhibitory and growth inhibitory activities using previously
reported assays.34 The results are summarized
in Table 1. A range
of activities were observed, with several compounds being inactive
(compounds 1–3 and 13) and a few
demonstrating inhibition of both S. mutans growth and biofilm at the micromolar range.

Table 1 Biofilm
and Growth Inhibitory Activities
of Stilbenes
a Average of at least five measurements;
NI: no inhibition; NA: not available.

Our studies have demonstrated that the stilbene scaffold
alone
does not possess a biological effect against S. mutans, as both the E and Z isomers were
inactive (compounds 1 and 2). A significant
effect is seen with the variation of substituents. Compounds 3 and 4 maintain the regiochemistry of the substituents
but differ in their functional groups. Whereas dihydroxyl stilbene 4 has demonstrated biofilm formation and growth with IC50 values of 344 and 854 μM respectively, diamino analogue 3 did not produce any activity in either growth or biofilm
formation. Similarly, compound 5 is a diamidine compound
that also has an extra hydroxyl group and has demonstrated biofilm
formation and growth with IC50 values of 104 and 179 μM,
respectively.

Compounds 6–9 explore the
regiochemistry and
the substituent effect of hydroxyl stilbenes. Compound 6 is the least active compound of this class, showing a high micromolar
range activity. This compound also does not have any substituents
on one of the rings. Compounds 7 and 8 are
natural products, resveratrol and piceatannol, respectively. These
compounds differ by the inclusion of one extra hydroxyl group. Previous
studies have shown resveratrol to inhibit S. mutans biofilm.26,27,35 In comparison to that, compound 8 shows a marginally
better activity toward S. mutans biofilm
with a 52 μM IC50 value and also demonstrates increased
(11-fold) selectivity. Compound 9 is a trimethoxy, monohydroxy
analogue of piceatannol that maintains its regiochemistry. This scaffold
demonstrated less biofilm inhibition, increased growth inhibition
compared to piceatannol (8), and decreased selectivity,
which suggests that the OH groups are important for the selectivity.

Because the glucan synthesis pathway involves the degradation of
glycosidic bond in sucrose and the formation of new glucosidic bonds
between glucosyl units, we were interested in exploring the effect
of attaching a glucose unit to one of the active compounds. Compound 12 is a glucoside analogue of piceatannol 8,
with the methylation of one of its hydroxyl groups. This compound
also shows similar activity when compared to that of compound 9. However, compound 13 is a piceatannol analogue
that has a glucose substituent that is not attached through a glucosidic
bond, and this compound is not active against biofilm and growth.
Finally, compounds 10–11 are miscellaneous scaffolds
that resemble a stilbene. Of these compounds, compound 11 demonstrated considerable activity against the S.
mutans biofilm. Overall, piceatannol (8) is the compound identified from this study that demonstrated good
activity and selectivity toward S. mutans biofilm inhibition.

Our Lead Compound, Piceatannol, Inhibited
Biofilms Selectively
Over Growth
A comparison of piceatannol’s ability
to inhibit S. mutans biofilm with reverastrol
and E-stilbene shows our lead to be the most potent
at 200 μM (Table 1 and Figure 2A). Upon
further analysis of the compound’s effect on S. mutans growth, we have identified previously studied
resveratrol26,27,35 and a novel agent called piceatannol to demonstrate biofilm inhibitory
activity with IC50 values of 102 and 52 μM, respectively,
with minimal bactericidal activity. We chose piceatannol for further
analysis because of its source of existence, simplicity of structure,
and ease of synthesis. Piceatannol is found in several natural sources
ranging from roots of Norway spruces, seeds of the palm Aiphanes horrida, and in Gnetum cleistostachyum.36 It is also a metabolite of resveratrol,
which is found in red wine, grapes, and passion fruit.37

Docking Analysis of Piceatannol in the GtfC
Active Site
Our docking model (Figure 2D) of piceatannol shows several key interactions.
This pocket
docked by the compound is at the same space occupied by acarbose,
a weak inhibitor of GtfC that was cocrystallized with GtfC.33 The best docked structure, visualized by UCSF
Chimera molecular modeling system, showed interactions of six amino
acids: Asp909, Asp477, Glu515, His587, Asp480, and Trp517. It is already
reported in the literature that binding of acarbose to Glu515 compromised
the acid/base catalyst function, whereas interaction with Trp517 blocked
the acceptor glycosyl moiety, explaining the inhibitory effects shown
by acarbose when bound to GtfC.33 The hydroxyl
functional groups interact with
Asp477, Asp480, and Glu515 and have interactions with Asp909 and Trp517.
The binding free energy of piceatannol predicted by FlexX software
was −25 kJ/mol, indicating a stable and strong binding with
the protein.

Binding and Inhibition of Gtfs by Piceatannol
and Resveratrol
To verify the docking results, we used the
Octet system to evaluate
the binding of potent small-molecule compounds to GtfB and GtfC. Recombinant
His-tagged GtfB and GtfC were produced, and HIS1K Biosensor was employed
to capture and quantify His-tagged Gtfs for binding kinetic characterization.
The kinetics of the binding of piceatannol and resveratrol with GtfB
and GtfC were examined and are shown in Figure 3A–D. The best binding fits were observed
with piceatannol, producing KD values
of 14.6 μM (Figure 3A) and 1.58 μM (Figure 3B) for GtfB and GtfC, respectively. These data are
consistent with the zymogram results, as the compound is more active
against GtfC when compared to GtfB. Resveratrol was also subjected
to the same analysis. Its KD values are
144 and 510 μM for GtfB and GtfC, respectively (Figure 3C,D). The piceatannol scaffold
is more potent toward GtfB. All four experiments produced reliable R2 values and fit well in the 1:1 binding mode.

(E) Results of the zymogram assay conducted with serial dilution concentrations

of compound treatment on the GTF enzyme production.

In addition to quantitative analysis, we performed
a zymogram assay
to evaluate the inhibition of Gtf enzymatic activity qualitatively,
as reported.3 Natural products, resveratrol
and piceatannol, were added to the growth media initially to see if
they had an effect on glucan production. The results parallel the
observations seen in biofilms, as piceatannol greatly reduced glucan
production when compared to the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control.
Resveratrol showed marginal inhibition. To assess the dose-dependent
effect, a zymogram assay was performed using same amounts of Gtf proteins
in each of the lanes resolved on the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and submerged in different concentrations
of the lead compound. Our results show an apparent decrease in the
bottom band where GtfC produces its glucans; a decrease in the upper
band is also observed in which GtfB and GtfD are comigrated, suggesting
that the compound inhibits at least two, if not all three Gtfs (Figure 3E,F). The zymogram
assay on resveratrol and E-stilbene paralleled the
biofilm inhibition. A higher inhibition was seen with piceatannol
in comparison to resveratrol, whereas the inactive E-stilbene in the biofilm assay showed no glucan inhibition. These
results suggest that the biofilm inhibition by the potent compound
is directly related to the inhibition of glucan production by Gtfs.

Piceatannol Does Not Inhibit the Growth of Commensal Streptococcal
Species
To evaluate the selectivity of piceatannol, we examined
its ability to affect bacterial viability in both biofilm and planktonic
cells of S. mutans. The viability of
the biofilms and the planktonic cells of S. mutans were not significantly impacted by the treatment of piceatannol.
Furthermore, piceatannol was used to assess its effect on the growth
of other oral commensal species (Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii) at concentrations
ranging from 50 to 400 μM. At the biofilm IC50 value
of 52 μM, less than 10% of growth of S. mutans, S. sanguinis, and S. gordonii is inhibited by piceatannol. Piceatannol
inhibits S. mutans cell viability by
37% at 400 μM and has reduced toxicity to S.
sanguinis and S. gordonii, decreasing the cell density by ∼15–18% (Figure 4A). Thus, piceatannol
exhibits significant selectivity for biofilms.

Piceatannol Inhibited S. mutans Colonization
in Vivo
The effect of piceatannol on S. mutans colonization in vivo was first evaluated
using a sucrose-dependent drosophila colonization model.38 Briefly, Gfp-tagged S. mutans bacteria were used to infect flies along with the treatment of piceatannol
at 50 μM in a feeding-assay (Figure 4B). DMSO was used as the negative control
(Figure 4B2) and gtfB mutant, a known biofilm defective strain, was used
as the positive control (Figure 4B3). The intensity of the fluorescence was measured
in the guts of the flies fed with the Gfp-tagged bacteria after 7
days of infection. A significant decrease in fluorescence was observed
when treated by piceatannol (Figure 4B4), producing an effect similar to that observed in
the gtfB mutant (Figure 4B3). These data suggest piceatannol inhibits S. mutans colonization in vivo.

We further
evaluated the in vivo efficacy of resveratrol and piceatannol using
a rat model of dental caries.39,40 The treatment of both
stilbenes produced a significant reduction in the buccal, sulcal,
and proximal surface caries scores of the treated animals, with piceatannol
demonstrating a greater reduction (Figure 5A). Although bacterial colonization appeared
to be reduced by the treatment with the tested stilbenes, it was not
statistically significant when compared with the control group treated
with water (Figure 5B). These data suggest that both piceatannol and resveratrol selectively
inhibit virulence factors, Gtfs and Gtf-mediated biofilm formation,
and do not affect the bacterial growth. At the time of sacrifice and
the removal of the mandible, there were no obvious differences in
the oral tissue (mucosal and gingival tissues) between the treated
and nontreated rats. Furthermore, because the treated rats did not
lose weight over the course of the study in comparison with the control
group, we believe that the natural stilbenes are safe and nontoxic.

Conclusions and Future Perspectives
Modulation of cariogenic
biofilms formed by S. mutans is a viable
strategy for the prevention and treatment of dental
caries. Considering the selectivity of polyphenols toward inhibiting S. mutans biofilms rather than altering its cell
viability, we have explored polyphenol scaffolds in an effort to develop
selective anti-biofilm agents. Here, we investigated the antimicrobial
and anti-biofilm activities of a small series of stilbenes against
the cariogenic bacterium S. mutans.
The identified lead compound, piceatannol, exhibited anti-biofilm
activity against S. mutans in the low
micromolar range with a selectivity index of about 11 through the
inhibition of the Gtfs, a key virulence factor of S.
mutans. This compound showed marginal inhibition of
the growth of S. mutans, S. sanguinus, and S. gordonii at high micromolar concentrations, suggesting its selectivity and
nontoxicity. Piceatannol inhibited S. mutans-induced cariogenecity in vivo. Thus, our study demonstrated a virulence-selective
therapeutic approach. This study has laid the foundation for additional
preclinical and clinical studies to explore the potential of piceatannol
as a new natural product-based drug that can be used for dental caries
prevention and treatment.

Methods
Structure-Based 3D Database
Search
The cocomplex crystal
structure of GtfC and acarbose (PDB code: 3AIC)33 was utilized
for the purposes of in silico docking. The active site residues were
selected using the a 6.5 Å parameter of the crystallized ligand,
acarbose, and residues Asp588 (H-acceptor) and Gln960 (H-donor) were
used to generate a pharmacophore. We accessed the ZINC database to
obtain a small library of polyphenolic small molecules and docked
them using FlexX. Binding energies less than −20 kJ/mol were
selected for further investigation, such as their druglike properties
based on Lipinski’s rules, binding interactions with key residues,
and synthetic feasibility.

Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions
Todd-Hewitt
broth (THB) agar plate and 5% CO2 in THB or in chemically
defined biofilm medium supplemented with 1% sucrose were used to grow S. mutans UA159 and various Gtf mutants, S. sanguinis SK36, and S. gordonii DL1 statically at 37 °C.41

Small-molecule compounds were obtained from the NCI. Stock solutions
(10 mM) were prepared in DMSO and arrayed in a 96-well format for
biological screening.

S. mutans Biofilm
Formation and
Inhibition Assays
A well-established protocol to study S. mutans biofilm formation in 96-well flat-bottom
polystyrene microtiter plates was used in triplicate.31,42 The stock solutions were prepared in 100% DMSO, and the final concentration
of DMSO used in the assays was 1%. Minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration
of compounds was determined by serial dilutions. The most potent of
these scaffolds were progressed into further evaluations.

Inhibition
of the Activity of Gtfs Determined by Zymographic
Assays
A previously reported zymographic assay was utilized
for the investigation of Gtf enzymatic activity.43 A 1:100 ratio of fresh 5 mL of THB with 50 μL of
selective compounds at a series of concentrations was used to dilute S. mutans UA159 cultures overnight and grown to OD470 of 1.0. The final concentration of DMSO used in the assays
was 1%. After the centrifugation at 4 °C, the supernatants were
isolated and filtered through a 0.22 μM pore size filter membrane
and dialyzed at 4 °C against 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH
6.8) with 10 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), followed
by a second dialysis against 0.2 mM sodium phosphate containing 10
μM PMSF. Samples (4 mL) were concentrated to 40 μL by
a 100K Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter (Merk Millipore Ltd.).

Next, 10 μL of each concentrated culture supernatant was applied
to 8% SDS-PAGE in duplicate. One gel was subjected to Coomassie blue
dye for protein detection, whereas the other one was subjected to
the zymographic assay, as described.43 The
resultant white opaque glucan bands were visualized against a black
background.

Cell Viability of S. mutans and
Commensal S. gordonii and S. sanguinis
Cell viability and the small-molecule
effect on it were investigated according to previous reports.42 DMSO served as the control group and provided
a relative comparison for the number of colony-forming units (cfu)
per milliliter for each compound at different concentrations determined
after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. The final concentration of
DMSO used in the assays was 1%.

Colonization of Drosophila
Colonization of flies was
performed, as described.38,44,45 Cultures of Gfp-tagged (green fluorescent protein) S. mutans UA159 grown to the middle log phase were
spun down and resuspended in a solution containing 5% sucrose and
50 μM of each compound. The resuspended cells (100 μL)
were aliquotted onto a sterile filter that was placed on the surface
of 5 mL of solidified 5% sucrose agar in a plastic vial. Upon drying
of the vials at room temperature for 30 min, the flies were introduced
to the vessels. Male Canton S flies (1–3 days old) were treated
with antibiotics for 2 days and starved for 3 h before addition to
vials supplied with S. mutans (10–14
flies per vial). A Nikon eclipse 90i microscope, equipped with an
Epi-fluorescence and NIS elements AR imaging system, was used to analyze
the colonization of flies by Gfp-tagged strains, as described.38

Dental Caries Rat Model
A previously
established rat
model of dental caries was used to study S. mutans in vivo colonization.46,47 Fischer 344 rats used
in this study were bred and maintained in Trexler isolators. At the
age of 20 days, rat pups were removed from isolators and randomly
assigned into five groups. Group A consisting of 3 female + 3 male
rats were treated with resveratrol; group B consisting of 3 female
+ 3 male rats were treated with piceatannol; group C consisting of
3 female + 3 male rats were treated with water; group D consisting
of 3 female + 2 male rats were not treated; group E consisting of
2 female + 3 male rats were neither treated nor infected by UA159.
Rats were then infected with S. mutans UA159 for 3 consecutive days and provided a caries-promoting Diet
305, which contains 5% sucrose (TD.80406, diet with 62% corn starch,
Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI), and sterile drinking water ad libitum.
The rats were then treated with stilbene, water, or not treated, respective
of their study group, as described above at 100 μM twice daily
for 4 weeks beginning 10 days post infection. Drinking water was withheld
for 1 h after each treatment. Rats were weighed at weaning and after
45 days at the termination of the experiment. The animals were euthanized,
their mandibles excised for microbiological analysis of plaque samples
on MS agar plates and BAP and for scoring of caries by the method
of Keyes.48 All experimental protocols
were approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee and in accordance with the relevant
guidelines and regulations.

Octet RED Analysis
Octet RED full
kinetic-binding analysis
was performed for piceatannol and resveratrol against GtfB and GtfC.
GtfC and GtfB were purified, as described previously.30 The Octet RED 96 system (ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA) was
used to determine the rate constant, KD. Phosphate buffer with 2.5% (w/v) DMSO was used as the negative
control. The dip-and-read Anti-Penta-HIS (HIS1K) Biosensor containing
Penta-His antibody from Qiagen preimmobilized on a fiber optic biosensor
was used to capture the Gtf proteins with high affinity and specificity.
Three-fold serial dilution treatment from 200, 66.6, 22.2, 7.4, and
2.46 to 0 μM was used to study the stilbenes in phosphate buffer.
Sensorgrams and the accuracy of the analysis was then calculated using
the ForteBio Octet RED analysis software (ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA).
