Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is a popular
material in membrane field
because of its excellent mechanical property, thermal stability, and
chemical resistance. Unfortunately, PAN nanofibers produced by electrospinning
are not suitable for interfacial polymerization process directly due
to its hydrophobicity and large average pore size. In this work, the
cross-linked chitosan (CS) solution was coated on the nanofiber surface
to fabricate a sublayer, based on which thin-film composite (TFC)
membranes were prepared using m-phenylenediamine
and 1,3,5-trimesoyl chloride as the monomers. The impact of the different
sublayers on the performances of TFC PAN nanofiber membranes for forward
osmosis (FO) was studied by varying cross-linked CS concentrations.
The results indicated that the increased CS concentration not only
led to the relatively denser polyamide layer, but also changed its
morphology. In the reverse osmosis process, NaCl rejection increased
from 46.5 to 83.5%. Salt flux from feed solution to draw solution
decreased from 25.8 to 8.9 g·m–2·h–1 (0.1 M NaCl solution as feed, 2 M glucose solution
as draw solution, FO mode). This study found that the sublayer had
noteworthy impact on the separation layer and helped us to pave the
way to design high-performance FO membranes.

1 Introduction
Water scarcity has become
one of the most serious issues around
the world due to continuous industrialization and population growth.1 Researchers have implemented several measures
to increase water supply, such as desalination and water reuse.2 Membrane processes (e.g., reverse osmosis (RO)
and nanofiltration (NF)) are believed to be effective and economical
due to their versatility, low investment of equipment, and easy operation.3 RO is now the most popular desalination process,
comprising 61% of the global share, followed by multistage flash at
26% and multieffect distillation at 8%.4 After the rapid development in the past 2 decades, however, the
energy required to separate potable water from seawater has nearly
reached the theoretical minimum energy of desalination.5 Therefore, the pretreatment and post-treatment
stages of the large-scale seawater reverse osmosis plants have been
focused to improve the energy efficiency. Forward osmosis (FO) as
an emerging technology capable of extracting water from feed solution
(FS) (low osmotic pressure) into draw solution (DS) (high osmotic
pressure) can achieve high water recovery as hybrid systems with RO.2

Thin-film composite (TFC) nanofiber membranes
prepared by interfacial
polymerization (IP) have been very attractive for constructing high-efficiency
composite membranes. Similar to RO and NF membranes, most of FO membranes
were fabricated in the type of TFC membranes. Generally, TFC membranes
have a multitier structure: a top layer responsible for the separation
of water and solute, an asymmetric porous support layer providing
a platform for IP, and a nonwoven substrate that gives mechanical
support for high hydraulic pressure operation (Figure 1A). Furthermore, TFC membrane is one of the
most widely applied types as both the selective and support layers
can be individually adjusted for specific needs.6−8 Nevertheless,
the difference lies in the design criteria of membranes.9 In the traditional membrane processes driven
by the hydraulic pressure, generally the polyamide top layer, dominating
the membrane performance (permeate flux, rejection, antifouling properties,
and the chemical durability), has received much more attention than
the support layer.10,11 When RO or NF membranes were
applied in the FO process, the membrane performances were far lower
than expected values.12,13 This phenomenon is mainly attributed
to internal concentration polarization (ICP), which reduced effective
osmotic driving force and created severe flow resistance within thick
and dense support layers.14 Hence, it is
necessary to redesign a new form of a support layer specifically for
FO processes. Nanofibers fabricated by electrospinning technology
have attracted tremendous attention in water filtration due to their
desirable properties for FO process, such as relatively high porosity
and interconnected pores with uniform pore sizes.15,16 Compared to conventional phase inversion membranes, the more open
structures of nanofibers provide a different platform for the IP.
McCutcheon’s group found that the polyamide layer delaminated
from polyethersulfone nanofibers easily due to the poor adhesion between
the polyamide and nanofibers.17 Wang et
al. prepared TFC FO membranes with two different surface pore sizes
of poly(vinylidene difluoride) nanofiber substrates.18 By comparing the two cases, the larger pore sizes of nanofibers
would decrease the cross-linking of the polyamide layer. Thus, the
large pore sizes and porosity endow the TFC membranes with the high
permeation while sacrificing the salt rejections. Other researchers
have addressed this issue by considering hydrophilic materials for
their favorable wettability to improve the salt rejection. Huang et
al. fabricated hydrophilic nylon 6,6 nanofibers as the support layer.19 Preferable performances were achieved, but it
should also be noted that these nanofibers were subjected to swelling
when exposed to water, meaning there were dramatic decreases in mechanical
strength. In addition, the results of poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofibers
also proved that the pressure resistance of hydrophilic nanofibers
should be enhanced, especially under high-pressure operation.20

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the traditional three-layered TFC
membranes
(A) and a novel three-layered composite TFC membrane presented in
this work (B).

To the address the mechanical
stability problem of hydrophilic
nanofiber support, our previous study adopted hydrophobic (water contact
angle: 108°) polyimide (PI) microporous nanofiber as support.
However, we found that polyamide layer could not be formed directly
on the PI nanofiber surface. Thus, a novel polymerization procedure
involving two IP procedures was developed to address this problem.21 Although the polyamide layer was successfully
synthesized according to the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images,
the salt rejection was comparatively unsatisfactory. Moreover, there
are only a few studies on how the polyamide layer affected by the
pore size of support membrane influences FO performance. Some previous
research works have proved that the cross-linking of the polyamide
layer is closely related to the pore size of the support layer, thus
leading to the different salt rejections and performances.18,22 Although the supports with different pore sizes were synthesized
with the same material in the studies, other properties were different,
such as thickness, porosity, and tortuosity, which also could affect
FO performance. It was uncertain whether these performance differences
were mainly caused by the polyamide layers or the supports themselves.

In this study, we also found that the hydrophobic polyacrylonitrile
(PAN) nanofibers were not suitable for IP process.20 Therefore, we introduced a new concept of a three-layered
composite membrane introducing a cross-linked chitosan (CS) sublayer
onto hydrophobic PAN microporous nanofibers to facilitate the IP process
(Figure 1B). The cross-linked
CS layer not only improved the wettability of the hydrophobic nanofibers,
but also provided the smooth and uniform surface for the IP. Aiming
at reducing ICP, the thickness of the membranes was controlled without
any backing layers (nonwoven substrates). The degree of cross-linked
CS layer was tailored by changing the glutaraldehyde (GA) and CS concentrations.
The intrinsic permeability properties and FO performance of the TFC–CS–PAN
membranes were examined. As these TFC FO membranes had identical supports,
the role of the polyamide layer alone on the FO performance was explored
without the disturbance of supports. We found that sublayer inserted
between supporting layer and separation layer had a noteworthy impact
on the separation layer, thereby leading to different performances.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphologies of Support
Layers and Active
Layers
The uniform PAN nanofibers were successfully fabricated
by electrospun, and their average diameter is 397.5 ± 46.3 nm
from Figure 2A. Considering
the electrospun PAN nanofibers are hydrophobic (water contact angle
can be 128°), it is difficult to form well-distributed liquid
layer when the aqueous phase is poured onto the nanofiber surface.23 There are large holes (>1 μm) on the
surface,
which is inappropriate for the IP procedures. As a result, the resultant
TFC membrane has low NaCl rejection after the IP procedure. Therefore,
it is necessary that nanofibers should be modified before the IP reaction.
First, the unmodified nanofiber supports were prewetted by the CS
solution to prevent the penetration of the cross-linked CS solution,
which was consistent with the observation from Figure 2E,F. When the CS–GA concentration
increased, the cross-linked layers covered the nanofiber network and
the nanofibers became invisible (Figure 2C,D). This indicated that the cross-linked
CS layers were successfully coated on the surface of PAN nanofibers.

CSGA–PAN-1 (magnification 10k×); (B) top surface of CSGA–PAN-2

(E) cross section of CSGA–PAN-3 (magnification 30k×);
and (F) cross section of CSGA–PAN-4 (magnification 30k×).

The top surface and cross-sectional
SEM images for polyamide selective
layers of TFC–CS–PAN membranes are shown in Figures 3 and 4. All TFC–CS–PAN membranes possess typical ridge-and-valley
structure without any defects from Figure 3. Figure 4 shows that the polyamide selective layers have strong
adhesion with the supports. This might contribute to the chemical
interaction between trimesoyl chloride (TMC) and the cross-linked
CS layer. According to the attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform
infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of the CSGA–PAN membranes and the
structural composition of CS, it was certain that −NH2 groups did exist on the surface of the CSGA–PAN membranes.
Other research works also reported that heat treatment could induce
the further cross-linking reaction between the residual unreacted
amine and acyl chloride groups.24,25 Thus, when the TMC
solution was poured on the m-phenylenediamine (MPD)-impregnated
support, the −COCl groups of TMC not only reacted with the
−NH2 groups of MPD, but also with those of CS.26 As a result, the newly formed byproduct of the
IP, −CONH, had generated good adhesion between the polyamide
layer and cross-linked CS layer. The average thickness of the polyamide
layers is approximately 100 nm for all four supports. Generally, no
notable morphological difference is observed on the top surface and
cross-sectional SEM images due to the same IP procedures.

Therefore, the surface morphologies
of the TFC–CS–PAN
membranes and the CSGA–PAN membranes were further characterized
by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As described in Figure 5, forming smoother cross-linked
CS layer leads to a decrease of the roughness of nanofiber surface
in terms of Ra and Rmax, which results in a slight decrease of the roughness of
polyamide layer. These results indicate a good agreement with the
SEM images.

membranes.

2.2 Chemical
Composition of CSGA–PAN and
TFC–CS–PAN Membranes
The ATR-FTIR spectra in Figure 6 confirm the presence
of the cross-linked CS layer and polyamide layer. Characteristic peaks
of PAN are located at 2243.3 and 2243.0 cm–1 representing
−C≡N stretching.6 Compared
to PAN nanofibers, the peaks of CSGA–PAN-4 at 1651.1 and 1559.2
cm–1 ascribed to amide −C=O (amide
I peak) and −N–H (amide II peak) become stronger due
to the cross-linking of CS chains.6 The
absence of the peak at 1590 cm–1 (−NH2 band) also confirms the occurrence of cross-linking reaction
between GA and the NH2 groups.27−29 The emerging
peak of TFC–CS–PAN-4 at 1610.9 cm–1 could be attributed to the aromatic amide of the polyamide layer.30 Moreover, the peak at 2243 cm–1 almost disappears in the spectra of TFC–CS–PAN-4,
which also indicates that the polyamide layer and the cross-linked
CS layer are flawless and shield the −C≡N stretching
from being characterized by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.

(a) PAN nanofibers, (b) cross-linked CS,
(c) CSGA–PAN-4, and (d) TFC–CS–PAN-4 membranes.

The formation scheme of polyamide
(Figure 7) shows that
a polyamide layer usually consists
of the cross-linking and linear structure. In this formation scheme, X represents the cross-linking portion of the resulting
polyamide and Y represents the linear part. If X = 1, the O/N ratio is 1 and the resultant polyamide is
fully cross-linking. Similarly, when Y = 1, the O/N
ratio is 2 and the resultant polyamide is fully linear.31 The relative atomic fractions and the cross-linking
degrees of the polyamide layer are presented in Table 1. The cross-linking degree of the active
layer could be estimated from following eqs 3 and 4 1   2  On the basis of the X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy
(XPS) results, the cross-linking portions increase from 0.11 to 0.80
with increasing CS and GA concentrations. In other words, smaller
pore size result in higher cross-linking degree of active layers,
thus affecting membrane performances.

2.3 Water Contact Angles and
Mechanical Property
Figure 8 shows the
water contact angles of PAN nanofibers and CSGA–PAN and TFC–CS–PAN
membranes. The water contact angles decrease significantly from 132°
for PAN nanofibers to 45–61° for CS-coated membranes,
implying that the membrane surface becomes more hydrophilic. This
could be attributed to abundant hydrophilic groups like −NH2 and −OH groups on the cross-linked CS layers. The
improvement of the hydrophilicity together with the smoother surface
of cross-linked CS layers might be beneficial to the IP processes.
Compared to those of CSGA–PAN, the water contact angles of
the TFC–CS–PAN membranes increase to 72–75°.
The reason might be that relatively more hydrophobic polyamide layers
had covered the hydrophilic groups of the cross-linked CS layers.
Moreover, the fact that the larger roughness has an effect on the
enhancement of the surface hydrophilicity accounts for this phenomenon.32,33

Table 2 shows
that
the PAN nanofibers have excellent mechanical properties. Only a slight
reduction in the mechanical properties was observed when nanofibers
were tested in wet states. Therefore, these modified nanofibers could
avoid the swelling state when exposed in water and become an appropriate
candidate for water treatment.

2.4 RO Performance
The PAN nanofibers
and CSGA–PAN membranes were first tested under RO mode. The
PAN nanofibers’ pure water permeability (PWP) can be as high
as 10 283 ± 992 L·m–2·h–1·bar–1 (LMH·bar–1), which exhibits superior PWP. This should ascribe to the water
transport pathway provided by the unique scaffold-like structure with
high porosity and low tortuosity. Also the hydrophobic property weakens
the interaction between water molecules and the pathway; thus, flow
resistance is reduced and water molecules slide through the pathway.34 As shown in Figure 9, the average pore sizes of the PAN nanofibers
and CSGA–PAN membranes are 483, 463, 452, 305, and 24.1 nm.
Increasing the CS and GA concentrations in cross-linking CS solution
can dramatically minimize the pore sizes of membranes surface and
make preparations for next IP procedures.

and average pore size: (A) PAN nanofibers
(483 nm), CSGA–PAN-1 (463 nm), CSGA–PAN-2 (452 nm),
and CSGA–PAN-3 (305 nm) and (B) CSGA–PAN-4 (24.1 nm).

Figure 9A,B presents
the permeabilities of water and NaCl, respectively. As revealed in Table 3, the performances
of TFC–CS–PAN membranes follow the same trend as those
of the CSGA–PAN membranes. Pure water permeance A decreases with decreasing pore sizes of the support. On the other
hand, NaCl rejections gradually increase with decreasing pore size.
Considering the fact that the morphologies and kinds of functional
groups are similar among these TFC–CS–PAN membranes,
the performance differences might be caused by the cross-linking degree
difference. According to the XPS results (Table 1), the higher X value means
the more aromatic amides of the cross-linking portion presented in
the polyamide layer. Therefore, TFC–CS–PAN membranes
based on the support with smaller pore size exhibited a lower water
permeation and a higher NaCl rejection.

2.5 FO Performance of the Standard Mode
Figure 10C,D reveals
the FO performances of water flux (Jv)
and reverse salt flux (Js) in standard
mode. Unexpectedly, the differences of the FO performance seem less
significant compared to those of the RO performance. Jv decreases 24.8% and Js is
6.0% in PRO mode, while the PWP decreases 75% and NaCl rejection increases
37% under RO mode. The reason might be that the substrate plays a
more important role in the FO process than that in the RO process.
In the RO process, the water flux and salt rejection are dominated
by the active layers, while the substrates merely provide the mechanical
support.35 The concentration polarization
of both internal and external can be ignored when the feed concentration
is not very high.36 However, when it comes
to the FO process, Jv and Js are affected by both the active layer and the substrate
due to the fact that driving force is the osmotic pressure difference
across the membranes.37 Let us take FO
mode as an example. When the active layer is placed against the feed
solution (AL-FS mode, named as FO mode as well), the membrane surface
osmotic pressure (πD,m) on the permeate side was
diluted and found to be inevitably lower than the bulk draw osmotic
pressure (πD,b). In the meantime, the membrane surface
osmotic pressure (πF,m) on the feed side was concentrated
and higher than the bulk feed osmotic pressure (πF,b). Therefore, the experimental osmotic pressure difference (ΔπE = πD,m – πF,m) across
the membranes would be lower than the theoretical one (ΔπT = πD,b – πF,b).37

Figure 10 Membrane performance: (A) PWP of the CSGA–PAN membranes,
(B) FO performance of the glucose mode, (C) water flux of the standard
mode, and (D) reverse salt flux of the standard mode.

When the pore sizes of the TFC–CS–PAN
membranes decrease,
the flow resistance increases and Jv should
decrease accordingly. Meanwhile, it also results in the higher salt
rejection, meaning that less amounts of salt passed through the selective
layers and the πF,m was less concentrated. Therefore,
the new osmotic pressure difference (ΔπE′)
was closer to ΔπT. In other words, the driving
force should be higher. Moreover, considering that flow direction
of Js is opposite to that of Jv, decreasing Jv facilitates Js.38,39 As shown in Figure 11A, Jv and Js of the standard mode
are affected not only by the flow resistance but also by each other.
In fact, the decreasing effect of the increased flow resistance on Jv and Js has been
counteracted by the increase of driving force to some extent. As a
result, the changes of FO performances are not so significant as those
of RO performances.

Figure 11 FO process of (A) the standard mode and (B) the glucose
mode.

2.6 FO Performance
of the Glucose Mode
In practical FO applications, the feed
solution cannot be the deionized
(DI) water that has little osmotic pressure and the draw solution
can be other kinds of solutes that have smaller diffusion coefficient
than NaCl.40,41 Moreover, the aforementioned
discussions indicate that the FO performance of the standard mode
had inherent limitations. To address these issues, the glucose mode
(2 M glucose solution as draw solution, 0.1 M NaCl solution as feed,
FO mode) was adopted to measure the FO performance. In this mode,
water and salt (NaCl, Js) have the same
flow direction, which is from the feed to the draw solution. Glucose
is chosen as draw solution for several reasons: (i) given that the
molecular weight of glucose is 180.16 g·mol–1, even the TFC–CS–PAN-1 with the lowest NaCl rejection
(46.5%) have >95% rejection of glucose. Compared to Js, the reverse salt flux (glucose) can be ignored; (ii)
the osmotic pressure of the 2 M glucose is 55 atm, which is close
to the osmotic pressure (47 atm) of 1 M NaCl.42,43

Figure 11B
demonstrates the FO process of the glucose mode. When flow resistance
increases, Jv and Js decrease 65.5 and 36.7%, respectively, indicating that the
pore sizes of the polyamide layer become smaller. And the data were
also close to the 75% decrease of the PWP and 37% increase of the
NaCl rejection under RO mode. Due to the same flow direction of the
water and salt flux, the salt flux is no longer suppressed by the
water flux. Furthermore, the decreasing Js also indicate that less amounts of salt reach the membrane surface
on the draw solution side and πF,m becomes smaller.
From this perspective, the driving force is reduced. Another noteworthy
thing is that the Jv of glucose mode is
lower than that of standard mode although the driving force is almost
same. It should be related to the different diffusion coefficient
of the draw solutes. Glucose as draw solution with larger molecular
weight has the lower diffusion coefficient (0.7 × 10–9 m2·s–1) and is more likely affected
by ICP than NaCl (1.4 × 10–9 m2·s–1).40,41

For the proper evaluation
of FO glucose performance of the introduced
membranes, the comparison of other reported membranes is summarized
in Table 4. Water flux
of the TFC–CS–PAN membranes is relatively high compared
to the other membranes when glucose is draw solution and DI water
or low-concentration NaCl is feed solution. Overall, the introduced
method to fabricate membranes expands FO membrane industrial applications
and produces commercial FO membranes with high water flux and salt
rejection.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, a sublayer of cross-linked CS fabricated on the hydrophobic
PAN microporous nanofibers could facilitate the IP process and have
a significant impact on membrane performances. Using these identical
PAN nanofibers as supports, the role of the polyamide layers as a
singular independent variable was focused. Generally, we found that
increasing the CS–GA concentrations not only decreased the
pore sizes of the sublayer, but also changed the surface properties.
On this basis, the formed polyamide layers became more selective and
led to different RO and FO performances. Therefore, introducing the
sublayer into the selective layer and supporting layer could be an
alternative method when designing new membranes (Figures 12 and 13).

4.2 Fabrication of PAN Nanofibers
The
method we used to fabricate the PAN nanofibers is modification of
the previous published work.48,49 PAN powder (10 wt %)
was dissolved in a co-solvent system of DMAc and DMF with 1:1 weight
ratio under room temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution. A 10.0
mL of the as-prepared solution was placed into a syringe pump and
electrospun onto a piece of paper using a laboratory-scale electrospinning
system, and the specific experimental conditions of PAN electrospinning
are summarized in Table 5. After 4.5 h electrospun time, the pristine nanofiber mat was peeled
off and then sandwiched between two pieces of paper and laminated
through a paper laminator (no. 3893, Deli, China) at 120 °C to
improve the mechanical property and obtain the smooth surface for
further preparation of polyamide barrier layer. Thicknesses of the
membranes were determined using a digital microcaliper, and they decreased
from 80 ± 5 to 60 ± 3 μm after 120 °C hot-pressing
(Table 6).

4.3 Surface Modification with
CS
The
modification method involves cross-linking of CS and GA. CS powder
was dissolved in a 200 mL mixture of water and acetic acid and stirred
at 50 °C for 4 h to obtain a homogenous solution. The CS solution
was poured onto the as-electrospun nanofibers for 20 min and then
placed upside down during the drying process in ambient temperature
to remove the redundant CS solution on the surface. In the meantime,
a certain amount of GA solution was added into the 200 mL CS solution
for cross-linking for 20 min and then the GA–CS solution was
poured onto the CS side of the composite nanofibers for another 20
min, followed by removing the excessive GA–CS solution and
drying thoroughly. The GA–CS solution contains 1.25, 1.50,
1.75, and 2.0 g of CS with the addition of 4, 4.8, 5.6, and 6.4 g
GA, respectively. For convenience, these composite membranes were
denoted CSGA–PAN-1, CSGA–PAN-2, CSGA–PAN-3, and
TFC–CSGA–PAN-4, respectively.

4.4 IP of
Polyamide Layer
The selective
layer was prepared by the conventional IP method.17 TMC (0.15 wt %, n-hexane as solvent) solution
and MPD (3.0 wt %, pure water as solvent, SDBS 0.1 wt % as surfactant)
solution were used for the IP. Sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS),
like sodium dodecyl sulfate, is a common type of surfactant.50 They can lower the interfacial tension due to
their amphiphilic nature.51 Therefore,
we believe that the use of SDBS can improve the wettability of the
support, promote monomer migration to the interface region, and enhance
the efficiency of the polymerization.52 First, the side of the modified nanofiber mats was contacted by
the MPD solution for 300 s. Excess MPD solution was removed from the
support surface using an air knife. The nanofiber supports were then
dipped into TMC solution for 120 s to form the polyamide film. The
resulting composite membranes were subsequently cured in an oven at
80 °C for 5 min for further polymerization. The TFC–CS–PAN
membranes were thoroughly washed and stored in DI water at ambient
temperature. Likewise, these TFC membranes were named as TFC–CS–PAN-1,
TFC–CS–PAN-2, TFC–CS–PAN-3, and TFC–CS–PAN-4,
respectively.

4.5 Characterizations
The water contact
angles (θ) of nanofiber membranes were measured by a contact
angle meter (JC2000A, provided by Shanghai Zhong Cheng Digital Equipment
Co., Ltd., China). Five different locations for the membranes were
subjected to the droplet of 2 μL water. All samples were tested
three times and averaged. The morphologies of the membranes were observed
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy
(AFM) images. The nanofiber membranes were coated with Pd via sputtering
before being examined by a scanning electron microscope (JEOL, JSM-5600LV).
The average fiber diameter of the nanofibers was determined by measuring
20 different fibers. The roughness of the membrane’s top surface
was characterized by AFM (Nanoscope IIIa Multimode) with a scanning
area of 5.0 μm × 5.0 μm. The surface chemical composition
of membranes was characterized by an ATR-FTIR spectrometer (Thermo
Nicolet Corporation). The mechanical property was evaluated using
QJ210A (Shanghai Qingji Instrument Technology Co. Ltd., China). Membranes
were cut into rectangular stripes of 4.0 cm × 1.5 cm dimensions
and pulled in tension at a constant elongation speed with an initial
length of 2.0 cm. The total porosity ε (%) of the resultant
membranes is determined by the gravimetric method as defined in the
following equation 3  where m1 (g) is
the weight of the wet membrane without excess water on the surface, m2 (g) is the weight of the dry membrane, ρw (g·cm–3) is the water density, and
ρp (g·cm–3) is the polymer
density.

4.6 Evaluation of Membrane Performance
A laboratory-made cross-flow RO testing unit (2 bar) was used to
evaluate the intrinsic properties, which were the pure water permeability
(A) (PWP, L·m–2·h–1·bar–1, abbreviated as LMH·bar–1) and the observed salt rejection (Rs). Both of them can determine the salt permeability (B) (L·m–2·h–1, abbreviated as LMH) of prepared TFC membrane described elsewhere.53 The feed concentration (1000 ppm NaCl) and the
salt concentration were measured using a DDS-11A conductance meter
(Shanghai Neici Instrument Company, China). Both A and B are the intrinsic
properties and are used to derive the structural parameter of the
membranes.54 The average pore sizes and
distributions of PAN nanofibers, CSGA–PAN-1, CSGA–PAN-2,
and CSGA–PAN-3 were determined by the bubble-pressure method
(Beishide Instrument 3H-2000PB, China), while CSGA–PAN-4’s
were characterized by the solute transport of a 100 mg·L–1 dextran (molecular weight 40k–2000k) solution
via ultrafiltration experiments.55,56

The
FO performance was determined by two kinds of process. In the standard
process, 1.0 mol·L–1 (M) NaCl solution was
used as draw solution (DS) and DI water was used as the feed solution
(FS). Osmotic flux tests were carried out in both FO (the active layer
faces the feed solution) and pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO, the active
layer faces the draw solution) mode. The water flux (Jv, L·m–2·h–1, abbreviated as LMH) was defined as the volume change of feed solutions
per unit time and unit area. Similarly, the reverse salt flux (Js, g·m–2·h–1, abbreviated as gMH) from the draw solution to the feed solution
was calculated by dividing the NaCl mass flow rate by the membrane
area and test time. The structural parameter (S)
can be determined by the following equation modified without considering
the effect of external concentration polarization in the PRO process54 4  where Ds is the
diffusion coefficient of the draw solute, Jw is the measured osmotic flux, A is the pure water
permeability, B is the solute permeability, and πdraw and πfeed are the osmotic pressure of
the bulk draw solution and feed solution, respectively.

In another
process, denoted as glucose mode, 2.0 M aqueous glucose
solution was used as draw solution (DS) and 0.1 M NaCl solution was
used as the feed solution (FS). Osmotic flux tests were carried out
in FO mode. Different from standard mode, the salt flux (Js) of glucose mode was from the feed solution to the draw
solution, which was also detected by the conductance meter in the
draw solution.
