As one of the branched-chain amino
acids, l-valine is
an essential nutrient for most mammalian species. In this study, the l-valine producer Corynebacterium glutamicumΔppcΔaceEΔalatΔpqo was
first constructed. Additionally, an improved biosensor based on the
Lrp-type transcriptional regulator and temperature-sensitive replication
was built. Then, the C. glutamicum strain
was mutagenized by atmospheric and room temperature plasma. A sequential
three-step procedure was carried out to screen l-valine-producing
strains, including the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS),
96-well plate screening, and flask fermentation. The final mutant
HL2-7 obtained by screening produced 3.20 g/L of l-valine,
which was 21.47% higher than the titer produced by the starting strain.
This study demonstrates that the l-valine-producing mutants
can be successfully isolated based on the Lrp sensor system in combination
with FACS screening after random mutagenesis.

==== Body
Introduction
l-Valine is
one of the nine essential amino acids that
must be supplied in the diet.1 It is largely
produced through microbial fermentation, and the production capacity
reached 2 thousand tons per year, with a market value of 45 million
dollars.2 Microbial production of l-valine has been established using various industrial microorganisms,
including Brevibacterium flavum,3Escherichia coli,4Corynebacterium glutamicum,5 and Bacillus subtilis.6 As a well-known workhorse for the production
of amino acids such as l-glutamate,7l-lysine,8l-isoleucine9 and l-threonine,10C. glutamicum is also viewed
as an attractive microorganism for the production of l-valine.

Industrial strains for the production of l-valine were
usually developed by traditional random mutagenesis or metabolic engineering.
The traditional strategies, which utilize toxic analogues, have been
used to produce the most efficient amino acid producing strains of C. glutamicum. Because of the inefficient genetic
manipulation of C. glutamicum and heavy
workload required to identify high-yield strains from very large mutant
libraries,11−13 metabolic engineering has emerged as a more efficient
solution for the production of specific amino acids and their precursors.14 Furthermore, the genome sequences of several C. glutamicum strains have been reported,15,16 and a high l-valine production phenotype was also obtained
through rational genetic engineering manipulation.17−22 In C. glutamicum, the l-valine
biosynthesis pathway competes with many by-product pathways, such
as l-alanine and lactic acid. Consequently, the strategies
to improve the yield of l-valine have largely focused on
the enhancement of downstream synthesis pathways in combination with
the inhibition of competing pathways.14

Rational design and subsequent metabolic engineering represents
an important tool for developing industrial production strains.23 However, because of the high complexity of carbon
and energy fluxes in living cells, rational approaches to strain development
are often restricted by the current knowledge of bacterial physiology.24 However, the limits of rational strain engineering
can be overcome by nonrational high-throughput approaches based on
random mutagenesis and sequential efficient screening methods.25 the biosensors that detect intra- and extracellular
metabolites or environmental signals are ubiquitous in nature.26 The use of biosensors has proven to be a highly
valuable tool to specifically transform the intracellular product
concentration into a screenable optical output, such as fluorescence.11,13,27 Transcriptional factor (TF)-based
biosensors for the high-throughput screening of engineered bacteria11,28,29 and fast selection of desirable
mutations30 are widely used because of
their ability to detect a wide variety of metabolites.29 In recent years, a large number of TF-based
biosensors have been applied for the screening of high-value products
such as amino acids,12,23,28,31,32 organic acids,33,34 and other microbial chemicals.12,35−41

In this study, adaptive evolution driven by an l-valine
biosensor in combination with fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) approach following rational genetic manipulation and atmospheric
and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis was successfully applied
to improve the l-valine production in C. glutamicum. This approach demonstrates the power of combining rational design
with biosensor-driven laboratory evolution approaches to improve the
production of specific amino acids.

80) was used for preparing competent cells of C. glutamicum. An LBHIS medium (2.5 g/L of yeast extract, 5 g/L of tryptone, 5
g/L of NaCl, 18.5 g/L of Brain Heart Infusion powder and 91 g/L of
sorbitol) was used for C. glutamicum transformation. When necessary, 30 mg/L of kanamycin was added to

Construction
of the Lrp-Based Biosensor
For the construction
of the biosensor, the rrnB terminator was amplified
from the pTRCmob plasmid using the primer pair rrnB-F/R,
digested with EcoRI and EcoRV, and
ligated into the same sites of the pTRCmob backbone
digested, resulting in pHL201.

The fragment containing the C. glutamicumlrp ORF28 and the intergenic region of lrp-brnF was amplified using the primers lrp-F and lrp-brnF-R. The egfp ORF was amplified by PCR using the primers gfp-F/R.
The two resulting fragments lrp-brnF and gfp were ligated by overlap-extension PCR. The PCR product
was digested with SacI/BamHI, and
ligated into the same sites of pHL201, resulting in the plasmid pHL202.

The temperature-sensitive C. glutamicum replicon rep was amplified from pDTW10943 using the primer pair rep-F/R. The PCR product
was then digested with SpeI and EcoRV, and inserted into pHL202, resulting in the plasmid pHL203. The
temperature sensitivity of pHL203 was tested in C.
glutamicum ATCC13032. The strains were grown in an
LBG medium in the presence of kanamycin at 30 °C for 16 h, then
introduced into a fresh LBG medium without kanamycin and grown at
30 or 37 °C. Samples were taken after 12 h, diluted, and spread
onto LBG plates with or without kanamycin, and grown at 30 °C
for 36 h. The colonies were counted on both plates and the proportion
of kanamycin-resistant cells in the sample was calculated.

C. glutamicum was seeded into an
LBG liquid medium and grown overnight, then transferred to a fresh
LBG medium at an initial OD562 of 1. When the OD562 reached 5, l-valine was added to a final concentration
of 0–40 mM. The fluorescence and OD562 were determined
after continuous culture at 30 °C for 2 h. Fluorescence measurements
were carried out using a SpectraMax M2 multidetection microplate reader
(Molecular Devices, CA, USA). The eGFP fluorescence was measured at
excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 530 nm, respectively.44

Construction of the Initial C. glutamicum Strain for ARTP
Chromosomal
inactivation of the ppc gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxylase (PEPC), aceE encoding the Elp subunit
of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex (PDHC), alat encoding aminotransferase (AT)
and pqo encoding pyruvate/quinine oxidoreductase
(PQO) in C. glutamicum ATCC13032 was
performed using the suicide vector pK19mobsacB.45 The primers used in this study were designed
according to the genome sequence of C. glutamicum and are listed in Table 2. The upstream fragment ppcU of the ppc gene
was amplified from the genomic DNA of C. glutamicum ATCC13032 using the primer pair ppcU-F/R; the downstream fragment
ppcD of the ppc gene was amplified using the primer
pair ppcD-F/R. The two fragments ppcU and ppcD were purified, mixed,
ligated by overlap extension PCR, and the fusion product was ligated
into the vector pK19mobsacB,45 resulting in the plasmid pK19mobsacB-Δppc.

The
plasmid pK19mobsacB-Δppc was
introduced into C. glutamicum ATCC13032
by electroporation and transformants were selected on
LBHIS agar supplemented with 30 mg/L of kanamycin.45 The kanamycin-resistant transformants were further grown
for 12 h in an LBG medium, and subsequently selected again on the
LBHIS plates supplemented with 10% sucrose. The sucrose-resistant
and kanamycin-sensitive colonies were further grown in an LB medium.
The deletion of ppc was further confirmed by PCR
using the primers ppc-V and ppc-R.
The cells of the mutant strain HL101 grew on the plate without antibiotics.
Similarly, the aceE gene in the genome of HL101 was
deleted, resulting in the strain HL102. Next, the alat gene in the genome of HL102 was deleted, resulting in the strain
HL103. Finally, the pqo gene in the genome of HL103
was deleted, resulting in the strain HL104. The replacement at the
chromosomal loci was verified by PCR using the primer pairs aceE-V/aceED-R,
alat-V/alatD-R, or pqo-V/pqoD-R, respectively.

Mutagenesis by ARTP and
Determination of Optimal Treatment Time
An ARTP-IIIS instrument
(Wuxi TMAXTREE Biotechnology Co., Ltd,
Wuxi, China) was used to carry out the ARTP mutagenesis.46 Pure helium was used as the plasma working gas
to irradiate the samples on the stainless-steel plate. The operating
parameters were as follows: (1) the radio frequency power input was
100 W; (2) the distance between the sample plate and the plasma torch
nozzle exit was 2 mm; (3) the helium gas flow rate was 8 SLM (standard
liter per minute); and (4) the temperature of the plasma jet was at
25–30 °C. The mutagenic effect was only dependent on the
treatment time.

The C. glutamicum strain HL104/pHL203 was grown to an OD562 of 10 in the
LBHIS medium (mid-log phase). To determine the optimal treatment time,
the cells were washed twice with 50 mL of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), after which 10 μL of the cell suspension (1 × 108 cells per milliliter) was spread on the sterilized steel
plate, and exposed to the ARTP nozzle exit for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
30, and 40 s. After each treatment, the samples were washed down with
1 mL of PBS into fresh sterile tubes, properly diluted, and cultured
on a solid medium with 30 mg/L of kanamycin at 30 °C for 2 days.
An untreated culture was used as a control. The appropriate treatment
time was selected based on the lethality rate, which was calculated
as follows  

Fluorescence Microscopy and Spectroscopy
After ARTP
treatment, HL104/pHL203 was cultivated on LBHIS plates at 30 °C
for 12 h, transferred into shake flasks containing 25 mL of LBHIS
with 30 mg/L of kanamycin, and grown for 2 days. The resulting cells
were harvested by centrifugation at 8000g for 10
min at 4 °C, followed by washing in PBS three times.44 The washed cells were resuspended in PBS and
vortexed for 5 min to obtain a uniform suspension. The cell suspension
was diluted to an optical density OD562 of 0.1 to avoid
internal interference44 and collected to
measure their GFP fluorescence by flow cytometry. The cells were screened
using a MoFlo XDP Flow Cytometry Sorter (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton,
CA, USA). The fluorescence signal of the eGFP reporter was measured
at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and the emission was detected
using a 530 nm band-pass filter. The “purify model”44 was used to improve the ratio of positive cells
in the library. All isolated cells were cultivated on LBHIS agar plates
with 30 mg/L of kanamycin at 30 °C for 48 h for further analysis.
The cells were transferred into 96-deep-well plates with 500 μL
of a fresh fermentation medium per well, and cultivated at 30 °C
for 48 h, at a shaking frequency of 1200 rpm and a shaking diameter
of 3 mm in a Microtron shaker (Infors, Switzerland).24,28 The biomass and the eGFP fluorescence of the cultures was measured
using a SpectraMax M2 multidetection microplate reader.44

Fermentations
The seed medium contained
25 g/L of glucose,
30 g/L of corn steep liquor (CS001, Angel Co., Ltd, China), 5 g/L
of urea, 1 g/L of KH2PO4·3H2O, and 0.5 g/L of MgSO4, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0
using 1 M KOH. The fermentation medium contained 120 g/L of glucose,
20 g/L of corn steep liquor, 20 g/L of (NH4)2SO4, 1 g/L of KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L of
MgSO4, 0.01 g/L of FeSO4·7H2O and 0.01 g/L of MnSO4·H2O. The pH was
adjusted to 7.0 and 20 g/L of CaCO3 was added to balance
the pH of the medium. When necessary, 30 mg/L of kanamycin was added
into the medium.

For flask cultivation, seed cultures grown
at 30 °C for 12 h were used to inoculate 25 mL of fermentation
medium in 250 mL flasks to an initial OD562 of 1.8. The
cultures were incubated at 30 °C and 200 rpm in rotary shakers
for 72 h. Samples were harvested for the determination of residual
glucose, biomass, and amino acids as described below.

Analysis of
Residual Glucose, Biomass and Amino Acids
The concentration
of residual glucose was determined using the SBA-40C
biosensor analyzer (Shandong Academy of Sciences, China).47 The cell density was determined by measuring
the optical density at 562 nm (OD562) using a UV-1800 spectrophotometer
(Beijing Ruili Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd, China). The levels
of amino acids were analyzed by HPLC on a 1200 series instrument (Agilent,
USA) according to the method reported by Kőrös et al.48

Results and Discussion
Construction of the Lrp-Based
Biosensor
To design a
biosensor that responds to elevated intracellular concentrations of l-valine, a module based on the transcriptional regulator Lrp
of C. glutamicum was constructed. The egfp coding sequence was cloned behind the plasmid region
containing the open-reading frame of lrp and the
intergenic region of lrp-brnF. Thus, the expression of egfp was placed under the control of the PbrnF promoter, which
intrinsically responds to the intracellular concentration of l-valine. When the biosensor plasmid pHL200 was introduced into C. glutamicum ATCC13032, a discernible fluorescence
signal above the autofluorescence of wild-type C. glutamicum was detected (Figure S1). To prevent
this leaky expression, the rrnB terminator was cloned
in front of Lrp to block the impact of other parts of the plasmid.
Furthermore, the rep replicon was replaced by a temperature-sensitive
replicon, resulting in the plasmid pHL203 (Figure 1a), which was again introduced into C. glutamicum ATCC13032. This construct effectively
reduced the background fluorescence and improved the performance of
the biosensor (Figure S1). The normalized
fluorescence intensity (fluorescence/OD562) was very low
when no l-valine was added and did not increase significantly
when added l-valine concentration was below 0.1 mM. Fluorescence
intensity increased significantly with the increase of the added l-valine concentration when added l-valine concentration
was higher than 1 mM (Figure 1b). The results were similar to that reported in a previous
study.49 This may be attributed to the
fact that the biosensor detects the intracellular rather than the
extracellular l-valine concentration. Although this method
is not particularly precise, it confirmed that the biosensor is functional.
The results indicated that the biosensor could work to detect different
levels of l-valine by generating corresponding levels of
fluorescence intensity. Temperature-sensitive plasmids can be maintained
at a given permissive temperatures,50 which
is favorable for further studies. The biosensor developed by Mustafi
et al. could not be easily removed from C. glutamicum, which complicates the subsequent transformation for metabolic engineering.28 By contrast, the plasmid pHL203 developed in
this study can be easily removed by increasing the temperature. The
temperature-sensitivity of pHL203 was confirmed in ATCC13032/pHL203
(data not shown) and was consistent with the results reported by Hu
et al.43

Construction of C. glutamicum Knockout
Mutants
The optimization of the intracellular
pyruvate pool can increase the l-valine production in C. glutamicum.19 Pyruvate
can be transformed into acetyl-CoA, oxaloacetate, l-alanine,
acetate, and l-valine (Figure 2). PEPC encoding by ppc converts phosphoenolpyruvate
to oxaloacetate, decreasing flow to l-valine. Deleting of
gene ppc increased l-valine production (Figure 3b). The elp subunit of PDHC
encoding by aceE converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.
Therefore, gene aceE was deleted in HL102. As shown
in Figure 3b, l-valine production increased and l-alanine became the major
by-product of strain HL102. l-alanine was formed by catalyzing
pyruvate with two enzymes encoding by alat and avat. However, l-alanine was still the major by-product
of the strains HL103 and HL104, even though the alat gene was disrupted (Figure 3b). More l-valine was accumulated though the growth
rate of HL104 was decreased because of the deletion of pqo. After 72 h of cultivation, HL104 produced 2.64 g/L of l-valine. Overall, the results demonstrated that the inactivation
of the PEPC, PDHC, AT, and PQO improved the l-valine production.
The inactivation of PEPC (encoded by ppc), which
converts phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate, was reported to improve
the l-valine production (36). A C. glutamicum strain with a mutant variant of aceE produced more l-valine than the control.17,43 The elimination
of PQO, which converts pyruvate into acetate, was also reported to
increase the l-valine production by increasing pyruvate levels.51 These above four candidate genes had been deleted
individually, but not simultaneously for strain development in some
previous studies.

conditions (a) and l-valine production (b) of C. glutamicum strains ATCC13032 (wild type), HL101,
HL102, HL103, and HL104. The fermentation was carried out in 250 mL
shake-flasks.

Consequently, the genes ppc, aceE, alat, and pqo were deleted from C. glutamicum ATCC13032 before mutagenesis by ARTP.
This engineering strategy, which was applied before the mutagenesis,
provided a more favorable starting strain to reduce the labor-intensity
of the whole project.

High-Throughput Screening of the ARTP-Mutants
Using the Biosensor
To allow the high-throughput screening
of strains with increased l-valine production, the plasmid
pHL203 was introduced into
the l-valine producer strain HL104. Random mutations were
induced by ARTP-irradiation, and high l-valine-producing
mutants were screened. HL104 cells containing the biosensor plasmid
were treated with helium-based ARTP for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and
40 s, respectively. The lethality rate was over 90% when the exposure
time exceeded 20 s (Figure 4). Therefore, the optimal exposure time was set at 20 s, with
lethality ranging from 90 to 95%.

Figure 4 Lethality rate of C. glutamicum irradiated
by ARTP. The line shows the lethality rate of cells treated by ARTP
with a radio-frequency (rf) power input of 100 W for 5, 10, 15, 20,
25, 30, and 40 s. The data represent the means ± SEM (n = 3).

An efficient producer
strain is one of the key factors that can
make or break the industrialization of biotechnological processes.
A rational design for the metabolic engineering of industrial strains
has been proved to be a valuable approach, but the design and engineering
of bacterial strains remains challenging because of the complexity
of the bacterial physiology. Consequently, random mutagenesis and
screening strategies are still widely used for strain development.27 The generation of genetic diversity is a key
first step in high-throughput screening. The ARTP mutation breeding
system is an effective method to generate genetic diversity and improve
product yields.37,46 ARTP can produce a variety of
high-energy, evenly distributed particles acting on the strands of
DNA in the microbial cells under atmospheric pressure, causing mutations
through an incomplete gene repair process.46 ARTP can generate hundreds of genomic modifications for FACS screening
using a suitable biosensor. Moreover, beneficial mutation can be obtained
by screening mutant libraries of strains that have first been modified
using metabolic engineering.24 The affected
sites can be identified by genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.

After mutagenesis, C. glutamicum cells were incubated in LBHIS medium at 30 °C for 12 h and
were then subjected to shake-flask fermentation for 2 days to promote
the l-valine production, and were then analyzed and sorted
by FACS. To ensure that the mutant library is sufficiently large,
about 108 cells were screened by FACS. The top 0.04% of
the screened cells according to the fluorescence intensity were sorted
and cultivated on LBHIS agar plates. The selected mutants were then
seeded into individual wells of 96-deep-well plates containing a fermentation
medium with 1% acetate. Acetate was added to support the growth of l-valine producing mutants with decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase
activity. In this strategy, biomass is produced from acetate and the l-valine production from glucose is initiated during the stationary
phase after the acetate is completely consumed.52

After 2 screening rounds, 900 isolates were preliminarily
selected
from the genetic library, and only 53 of the selected isolates were
further confirmed that they exhibited obviously increased fluorescence
intensities than the starting strain in 96-well plate fermentations.
Eight improved mutants with the highest relative fluorescence intensity
(Figure 5a) and three
negative mutants showing no obvious fluorescence change (Figure 5a) were then chosen
to inoculate in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask, and allowed to grow for
3 days at 30 °C and 200 rpm for the production of l-valine.
In order to explore whether the changes of fluorescence intensity
were caused by the sequence variations of the biosensor, the rrnB-lrp-brnE-gfp functional region of
the plasmid in eight improved mutants was confirmed by DNA sequencing,
and no mutations were found. The results demonstrated that the increase
of fluorescence was caused by the change of l-valine content
and not by the mutation of the biosensor.

Analysis of l-Valine Production by the Screened Mutants
Biosensor systems and high-throughput FACS screening rely on the
detection of intracellular signals intensity rather than extracellular l-valine concentration. Thus, quantitative analysis of l-valine titer was also needed to determine the metabolite production
in the supernatant of isolated mutants.

The biomass and amino
acid production of the top eight mutants and control strain are shown
in Figure 5. The top
eight mutants produced more l-valine than the control strain
after 72 h of fermentation. The best mutant HL2-7 produced is an l-valine titer of 3.20 g/L, which was a 21.47% improvement over
the control strain (Figure 5b). After 5 rounds of cultivation, the mutant HL2-7 still
produced 3.15 g/L of l-valine, suggesting that the observed
production phenotype was genetically stable. As expected, the negative
isolates showing no observed changes in the fluorescence properties
exhibited l-valine production comparable to the starting
HL104 strain. In addition, the mutants with only a moderate increase
in fluorescence intensity also demonstrated varying degrees of increase
in the l-valine production (Figure S2). Overall, these results suggest that the combination of ARTP with
biosensor-based FACS screening can be used to improve the l-valine production in C. glutamicum.

It should be noted that, although the selected isolates improved
the production of l-valine, the titers of the by-products
alanine and lysine were still high in most mutants (Figure 5c). One possibility was that
the ARTP random mutagenesis may result in specific pathway optimization
by redesign of unknown regions, and allowed to more carbon fluxes
for the l-valine production without disturbing the byproduct
synthesis pathways. According to the previous studies, the factors
affecting the production of l-valine include the expression
level of l-valine biosynthesis genes, feedback inhibition
of key enzymes, and the supply of NADPH.5,14,24,51 The sequencing of the
eight mutants have been completed, and the mutation sites are still
in the process of analysis and verification. Structural Variation,
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, and Small InDel results were shown
in Table S1. A lot of Structural Variation
at the genomic level were found in each mutant, indicating the strain
was damaged greatly after the ARTP mutation. The number of SNP and
Small InDel in each mutant were fewer. Some sites have been reported
before, such as the mutation of ilvBN, which reduces
the feedback inhibition regulation. Some sites have not been reported,
which need further experimental verification. The sources of variability
in internal l-valine accumulation among the mutants derived
from HL104 will be analyzed and identified in the future studies.

In the present work, we successfully established a biosensor-driven
laboratory evolution approach for the improvement of the growth and
metabolite production of industrially relevant strains by directly
selecting individual cells based on the fluorescence output of the
biosensor using FACS.
