Copper–cyclodextrins
(CDs)-catalyzed aerobic oxidation of
alcohols under aqueous conditions and a concomitant formation of Cu2O–cyclodextrin nano-superstructures (Cu2O–CD nps) during the reaction are reported. The use of affordable
copper and cyclodextrin combination for aerobic oxidation precluding
organic solvents makes it a benign methodology. Intriguingly, a diverse
array of Cu2O–CD nps with unique morphologies was
obtained by varying copper salts, cyclodextrins, and bases. The nano-superstructures
were characterized by different techniques, such as X-ray diffraction,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetric
analysis, scanning electron microscopy, time of flight secondary-ion
mass spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy to confer
their authenticity. Interestingly, the nano-superstructures showed
promising catalytic efficiency for a one-pot three-component propargylamination
reaction. The used particles were found to be recoverable and recyclable
for propargylamination for up to three cycles, with no loss of catalytic
activity. Moreover, the concomitant formation of Cu2O–CD
nanostructures and their self-segregation during an aerobic oxidation
reaction under homogenous conditions is a first-of-its-kind method
depicting simultaneous catalysis and metal waste valorization (SCMWV).
Overall, this new approach of reaping the benefits of homogenous metal
catalysis and simultaneously sequestrating the metal into a high-value
product might pave the way to develop many such SCMWV protocols in
future.

Introduction
Aerobic oxidations
are all important upcoming green organic reactions,
which utilize cheap and abundant molecular oxygen to synthesize valuable
organic compounds.1 Amongst them, the oxidation
of alcohols2 is an indispensable transformation,
well known with N-oxide radicals (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO), 9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane N-oxyl, etc.),3 nanocarbons,4 graphene/graphite oxide,5 supported metals,6 and metal catalysts.7 Unlike the conventional oxidation methods, aerobic
oxidations delineate the need for extra steps to treat and dispose
oxidant waste, as they generate the nontoxic side product water. For
this reason, they are not only regarded as economical but also environmentally
beneficial. Unfortunately, despite the substantial benefits, several
factors, such as fire (or explosion) hazards of organic solvents,
the need for modified plant designs, along with specialized equipment,
limit its large-scale utility. Additionally, requisites such as elevated
temperatures and pressures (to compensate the “limiting oxygen
concentrations”) for achieving significant conversions escalate
the overall cost of the process. Thus, on account of these drawbacks,
aerobic oxidations are seldom preferred in the pharmaceutical and
fine chemical industry.8 In this context,
from the perspective of green chemistry, to make oxidations safe and
sustainable, the use of benign solvents such as water can be a promising
alternative. Owing to its abundance, nontoxicity, and nonflammability
water has been explored as solvent by many research groups and proven
to be an excellent cost-effective replacement for the toxic solvents.9 The other aspects such as the ability to enhance
reactivity and selectivity make it a promising candidate. However,
the solubility of organic substrates negates the advantages and makes
it difficult to channel the full utility. In such cases, the use of
supramolecular catalysts such as cyclodextrins (CDs)10 emulates the solubility issues.

Cyclodextrins, also
known as “Shardinger’s dextrins”
are toroid-shaped cyclic oligosaccharides comprised of several glycopyranose
units linked by 1,4-glycosidic bonds. They possess a hydrophilic outer
surface and a hydrophobic cavity. The cavity is accountable for the
selective reversible binding of molecules (inclusion phenomenon) driven
predominantly by hydrophobic11a,11c and noncovalent interactions.11b The fascinating feature of cyclodextrins akin
to enzymes has been widely exploited for various reactions, such as
oxidations,12 reductions,13 protections,14 cycloadditions,15 and epoxide ring opening.16 Besides these, several other uses of native/modified CDs
include capping agents of metal nanoparticles and semiconductor nanocrystals,
templates for nanocluster composites, nonporous metal organic frameworks,
and molecular recognition. Furthermore, from the standpoint of biomimicking
catalysis, CD–metal complexes mimicking the active sites of
metalloenzymes is an upcoming area of interest which is vastly expanding,
especially the catalysis by the copper–CD dyad.17 Moreover, many essential molecular oxygen activator
enzymes found in some aerobic organisms are known to house the copper
cofactor. Also, copper is an inexpensive, non-noble metal widely known
for its catalytic versatility.18 Therefore,
considering the advantageous characteristics of copper–CD and
the limitations of aerobic oxidations, we decided to exploit the same
combination for biomimetic oxidation of alcohols under aqueous conditions.
During such an effort, we serendipitously discovered the unusual concomitant
formation of Cu2O–CD nano-superstructures (Cu2O–CD nps) while carrying out the aerobic oxidation
of alcohols in water (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Comparison of Previous Methods and Our Report
Generally speaking, in metal
catalysis, homogenous reactions are
considered superior to heterogeneous reactions because of their performance
tunability, scope for improvement through ligand design and better
understanding of the mechanisms at molecular levels. Unfortunately,
factors such as the generation of copious metal waste, high energy
consumption, and the use of hazardous solvents make the homogenous
reactions uneconomical and prevent their significant potential for
industrial utility. Even the recently emerging alternate methods that
make use of alternate solvents, such as ionic liquids,19 scCO2,20 and switchable systems (fluorous solvent systems),21 to separate the homogenous catalysts via multiphase catalysis22 are less tangible, as the procedures involved
are complex and cumbersome. Under such circumstances, the discoveries
of new methods which are conducive for catalysis and facilitate the
spontaneous metal recovery are highly desirable. Therefore, with a
view to the same purpose, we present herein a novel approach of simultaneous
catalysis and metal waste valorization (SCMWV), wherein a possible
solution to the burgeoning problems of metal waste recovery and disposal
are provided. Moreover, this report validates the concept of “simultaneous
waste valorization” which might pave way for the development
of greener and sustainable protocols.

Results and Discussion
Initially, we started our investigation using piperonyl alcohol
as a model substrate with the combination of copper(II) acetate and
β-cyclodextrin, Na2CO3 as base, and with
TEMPO as an additive under aqueous conditions at room temperature.
The substrate took 24 h for complete conversion to afford piperonal
in 91% yield (Table 1, entry 1) without any over oxidation side products. With this preliminary
result, we screened various bases, cyclodextrins, and copper salts
to achieve the best conversions of alcohol. K2CO3 (1 equiv) was found to be most effective of all of the bases tried
and was continued for further study (Table 1, entry 6). Reducing the equivalents of base
has drastically reduced the product yields (Table 1, entries 7–10), whereas no further
change in yields was observed when the amount was increased to 2 equiv
(Table 1, entry 11).
Although the yields were promising with various cyclodextrins during
the initial screening (Table 1, entries 12–15), β-CD was selected for further
study taking into account the cost of benefit. Of the various copper
salts tested, copper acetate afforded the best conversions (Table 1, entries 16–18).
The optimum amount of copper and CD for obtaining the maximum substrate
conversion was found to be 10 mol % each. An increase of the amount
of copper–CD gave almost same yield, whereas a decrease in
the amount resulted in lowering of yield. Nevertheless, the reactions
without either one of them, that is, copper, CD, or TEMPO, showed
meager progress (Table 1, 19–21).

These
results indicated that Cu, CD, and TEMPO are essential for
the smooth conversion of alcohols. Overall, the best combination to
achieve maximum conversions turned out to be 10 mol % Cu(OAc)2·H2O, 1 equiv of K2CO3, 10 mol % of β-CD and 10 mol % of TEMPO. Thus, with the set
of optimized conditions in hand, we further proceeded to test various
substrates for their conversions. A variety of functional groups,
such as CH3O, Cl, OH, NO2, CH3, and
alkynyl were tolerated to afford the products in good to moderate
yields (96–65%). The electronic effects played a major role
in the reactivity of the substrates, which can be clearly seen in Table 2. The electron-donating
groups afforded products in better yields when compared to the electron
withdrawing groups, a trend that is comparatively similar to that
observed in earlier reports. The other substrates such as heterocyclic
and secondary alcohols also underwent smooth conversions to afford
the respective aldehydes in good yields (90–78%). Unfortunately,
the catalyst showed very poor activity toward aliphatic alcohols.
Surprisingly, in all of the reactions tried in Table 1, the end of the reaction was accompanied
a significant amount of an “orange-reddish precipitate”.
All of these reactions followed a typical color change pattern, wherein
an initial homogenous blue solution (characteristic of copper) slowly
transformed to a hazy bluish hue, which after 20 min turns green and
finally after an hour into an orange-reddish mixture, as shown in Figure 1. All of the precipitates
obtained were analyzed by several characterization techniques, such
as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
to validate their composition and morphology. The powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) spectra (Figure 2) recorded for the sample (conditions: Table 1, entry 6) showed peaks for the lattice planes
[1 1 0], [1 1 1], [2 0 0], [2 2 0], and [3 1 1], which were indexed
to Cu2O (JCPDS: 05-0667). The XRD spectra of all of the
different samples obtained in Table 1 exhibited peaks corresponding to both CD and Cu2O (Figures S1−S3, SI). A
deviation of CD peaks when compared to those of the native CD in all
of the samples endorsed the formation of a Cu2O–CD
composite. The shift is apparently because of the interaction of CDs
with Cu2O. The XRD for the sample obtained under the conditions
without cyclodextrin (Table 1, entry 20) showed patterns corresponding to both oxides of
copper, that is, Cu2O and CuO (Figure 2). Surprisingly, a year-old precipitate,
when checked by powder XRD, did not display any peaks corresponding
to CuO (Figure S4, SI). On the other hand,
precipitate formation was not seen when each of the precursors, that
is, TEMPO, alcohol, and base, alone were employed
for the reaction along with copper and CD. On the basis of these results
and also recalling the fact that CDs are nonreducing sugars, it can
be concluded that Cu and CD interactions play a crucial role in preventing
over oxidation of the formed oxides and the reduction of copper metal
might be because of the oxidation of alcohols mediated by TEMPO/oxygen.
Furthermore, to understand the surface morphology of the precipitates,
we proceeded to analyze them by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
technique. As shown in (Figure 3), when CDs such as β-CD, α-CD, randomly methylated
β-CD, and γ-CD are employed for the reaction, different
morphological structures of spherical shape (α, β, γ-CD)
and rosylike shapes were formed (Figure 3A–D). The other examples wherein potassium
carbonate was incrementally varied from 20 mol % to 1 equiv, various
structures resembling cabbages and urchins were obtained. Whereas,
only spherical aggregates were formed with 1 equiv of Na2CO3, K3PO4, and Cs2CO3. Surprisingly, the shapes of the particles were discrete
in the cases of CuCl2, CuSO4·5H2O, and CuBr2 (Figure S5, SI). From the above SEM studies, it can be concluded that the morphologies
and surface structure of the supernanostructures can be tuned by changing
the CDs, copper salts, and bases. In continuation to the characterization
of the precipitates, we further proceeded for the X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis to establish the oxidation state of copper.

As shown in Figure 4, a sharp peak at 932.8 eV corresponding to CuI 2p3/2 of Cu2O was observed. A shoulder at 934.5 eV
corresponding to CuII 2p3/2 along with satellite
peaks at 943.5 and 963.5 eV, which are diagnostic of a CuI (3d9 shell),23 were also observed.
The peaks corresponding to cyclodextrin (carbon) were also noticeable
in the XPS survey (Figure 4). The presence of CD in the sample was also supported by
the time of flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS-TOF) analysis.
A peak of m/z = 1173 provided a
strong basis for the presence of β-CD, which can be assigned
to the single charged K-ion adduct of the intact β-CD molecule.
The spectra also showed secondary ion peaks at m/z = 163 and 325, attributable to one and two glycopyranose
units of CD, respectively (Figure S6, SI).

(b) Cu(I) peak.

Besides these studies,
to establish the distribution of copper
and CD in the formed particles, the SEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) mapping was carried out (Figure 5). The actual distribution of carbon in the sample
cannot be distinguished in the mapping because of the conductive carbon
tape used in the sample preparation. The Cu map follows a spherical
distribution in the CD matrix, with the O map coinciding as well.
Thus, strongly suggesting that Cu and O are evenly distributed and
the superstructures are consistently composed of Cu2O–cyclodextrin.
Likewise, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the
same sample has proved that the particles are high-density compact
metal aggregates (Figure 6).

(SEM-EDX) and elemental mapping data images of Cu2O–CD
superstructure.

24 h and (B) after 1 h.

Overall, on the basis of the above-discussed characterization
and
control experiment studies, we propose a mechanistic rationale for
the formation of particles (Scheme 2). At first (step 1),17 the
dissolved copper and CD might be forming a complex in the solution,
followed by reduction of copper with subsequent alcohol oxidation
mediated by TEMPO (step 2) to afford Cu2O nanoparticles
stabilized by CDs via capping. Many of such initially formed particles
may aggregate to afford the superstructures (step 3).

Scheme 2 Plausible
Mechanism for the Formation of Hybrid Cu2O–CD
Nano-Superstructures during Aerobic Oxidation
Steps:
(1) Cu–CD interaction
in aqueous solution, (2) capping of Cu2O by CDs, and (3)
formation of Cu2O–CD aggregates.

Even though the above studies provided insights to understand the
superstructures’ formation, it is equally important to quantify
the amount of copper converted into the oxide. As revealed by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) studies (Figure S7, SI),
the precipitates obtained were hydrated; therefore, an indirect method
was adopted to estimate the copper conversion. After careful separation
of precipitate from the solution, the filtrate was subjected to inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) analysis to find out the amount of unreacted
copper. The amount of copper converted to Cu2O was back-calculated
and was found to be 82.5% (copper conversion to the oxide) in a typical
run.

However, the same indirect method could not be adopted
to quantify
the amount of cyclodextrin present in the hybrid, as the freeze-dried
recovered CD from the solution was highly hygroscopic and made the
task unfeasible. To our surprise, the XPS and EDAX analysis of the
obtained composite did not show any presence of potassium thus confirming
that much of the potassium has remained in the aqueous phase of the
reaction mixture. The same aqueous mixture containing the potassium
carbonate salt was reused for the alcohol oxidation by charging it
with cyclodextrin, alcohol, and copper. The oxidized product obtained
in the reaction
was 93% consistent to the native one (Figure S8, SI). Therefore, the base present in the aqueous phase was
also found be recyclable for further reactions.

Having completed
the particle synthesis and aerobic oxidation,
our attention was drawn toward finding a utility for the as-synthesized
particles. A thorough literature survey revealed that Cu2O is used as the catalyst for various organic transformations. Therefore,
we chose to test the same for a three-component propargylamines synthesis.
In a typical study, benzaldehyde, piperidine, and phenylacetylene
were taken and heated at 100 °C under solvent-free conditions
(Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Cu2O–CD-Catalyzed Propargylamines Synthesis
To our delight, we found that
the particles successfully catalyze
the reaction to afford the product in 85% (isolated yield). As the
reaction was carried under neat conditions, it was possible to reuse
the catalyst just by recovering the crude product by addition of ethyl
acetate. After decanting the solvent, the round bottom flask containing
the catalyst was air-dried and checked for the propargylamination
reactions. Likewise, we were able to recycle the Cu2O–CD
catalyst for three cycles with no loss in catalytic activity, affording
the products with only slight variation of yields (Figure 7). The ICP analysis of the
ethyl acetate extracts were carried out to check for any leaching
of the copper from into the solution. The analysis revealed that only
a negligible amount of copper has leached into the solution (7.2 ppm).
Additionally, the surface and XRD analysis of the used catalyst (third
cycle) was carried out to probe for any compositional and structural
changes. The SEM analysis did not show any morphological changes thus
confirming the intactness of the particles (Figure S5, O, SI). No significant change in peaks of the XRD
pattern also endorsed that the catalysts did not undergo any change
(Figure S9, SI). All of these studies indicated
a possible surface-mediated catalysis.

synthesis.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have developed a sustainable protocol for the
aerobic oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by copper–cyclodextrins
under aqueous conditions at room temperature. A serendipitous concomitant
formation of Cu2O–CD nano-superstructures during
the aerobic oxidation precluding any extra reducing agents is reported
for the first time. The morphological tuning of particles with variation
of copper salts, CDs, and bases was thoroughly investigated. The formed
particles were systematically characterized and shown to be efficient
catalysts for one-pot three-component propargylamination. They were
also recyclable up to three cycles with no loss of catalytic activity
to consistently afford the product in good yields. Various techniques
showed the evidence for the intactness of the formed structures thus
supporting propargylation to be taking place via a heterogeneous pathway.
Apparently, this study has provided substantial insights regarding
the metal waste valorization. Even though prevention of waste is always
better than treating it, with the current existing knowledge, waste
prevention is not always possible, and yet many reactions are still
in practice due to the nonavailability of alternate processes. In
this context, the discovery of new organic reactions, wherein the
generated waste is “simultaneously valorized” while
substrates are undergoing conversion, might pave the way to make organic
reactions greener. Further studies to develop such similar simultaneous
catalysis metal waste valorization (SCMWV) protocols are underway
in our group.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All reagents and starting materials
were obtained commercially from sources and were used without
additional purification. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed
on silica (Silica Gel 60 F254) precoated aluminum plates, and the
products were visualized by a UV lamp (PHILIPS TUV 8W lamp) and I2 stain. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded
on a (Shimadzu XRD-6100 using Cu Kα radiations = 1.5405
Å) powder diffractometer instrument. Transmission electron microscopy
studies were performed using a Philips CM200 transmission electron
microscope at 100 kV. ICP-atomic emission spectroscopy was performed
using the ARCOS model instrument from M/s Spectro, Germany. The 1H and 13C NMR were recorded in CDCl3 using the residual solvent peak as a reference on an Avance III
and Bruker NMR spectrophotometer at 400 and 101 MHz, respectively.
In most cases, column chromatography was not required. Passing the
crude product through a short pad of silica gel afforded the analytically
pure product.

General Reaction Procedure for Oxidation
of Alcohols
To a solution of copper acetate (20 mg, 10 mol
%) in water (10 mL),
β-cyclodextrin (113 mg, 10 mol %) was added. The solution turned
to transparent blue after 5 min. To this, potassium carbonate (138
mg, 1 mmol) was added and stirred for another 10 min (solution turned
into hazy blue color). Later, alcohol (1 mmol) and TEMPO (31 mg, 20
mol %) were added and vigorously stirred under air at room temperature
till complete conversion of the starting material as seen by TLC.
After completion of the reaction, the residue was filtered and ethyl
acetate (3 × 10 mL) was added to extract the product. The combined
organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified on a short
pad of silica gel using petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (most cases
filter column) to obtain the pure product.

General Reaction Procedure
for Propargylamines Synthesis
A mixture of benzaldehyde (102
μL, 1 mmol), piperidine (119
μL, 1.2 mmol), phenylacetylene (165 μL, 1.5 mmol), and
Cu2O–CD (50 mg) were stirred in a round bottom flask
at 100 °C for 1 h. After completion of the starting material,
as monitored by TLC, the reaction was cooled to the room temperature.
To this, ethyl acetate (3 × 5 mL) was added, stirred at room
temperature for 5 min, and later centrifuged to separate the catalyst.
The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate,
concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the crude product. The
crude was purified on a short pad of silica (petroleum ether/ethyl
acetate) to obtain the pure product.
