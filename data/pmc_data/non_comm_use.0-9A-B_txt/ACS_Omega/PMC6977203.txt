In this study, an in situ-generated
hydrofluoric acid (HF) was
used for sandstone acidizing, where an acid precursor (ammonium fluoride
NH4F) reacted with a suitable oxidizer (sodium bromates
NaBrO3) in an exothermic reaction. First, the new chemical
mixture was prepared to react with pure quartz samples and the reaction
effluent was analyzed to identify the presence of Si+ ions
using the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) technique. Core flooding
experiments were performed using Gray Berea sandstone cores (6 in.
length and 1.5 in. diameter). A preflush stage of 5 PV of 7 wt % HCl
was injected to remove any calcite content in the core. The main chemicals
were then flushed for 3 successive cycles of 1 PV each. To assure
core integrity, scratch tests and NMR scans were run on the core sample
before and after the treatment. The new chemical mixture could dissolve
the quartz sample and reduce its weight by 80 mg. The concentration
of the dissolved Si+ ions was more than 90 ppm. This proves
the capability of the chemical mixture to generate HF. The initial
core permeability was measured at a stabilized flow rate of 2 cm3/min to be 33 mD. After the acid preflush stage, the core
permeability reduced to 31 mD. Core permeability increased immediately
after the first treatment cycle and reached 41 mD. At the end, the
core flooding results showed a permeability improvement for Gray Berea
sandstone cores by almost 40%. The ICP analysis of the effluent showed
a total amount of chelated Si+ ions of about 10.5 mg. In
addition to the high temperature generated in the near-wellbore area,
the pressure increased because of the produced nitrogen gas from the
exothermic reaction and reached about 600 psi. The scratch test showed
an increase in the sample uniaxial compressive strength from 7432
to 9235 psi. The dynamic Poisson’s ratio and the dynamic Young’s
modulus increased as well from 0.17 to 0.19 and from 2159 to 3585
ksi, respectively. The enhancement in the mechanical properties of
the core can be attributed to the presence of the potassium element
in Berea cores and its solidification reaction with the HF generated.
The NMR measurements of the core sample before and after the acidizing
process show an increase in the core porosity; however, the core preserved
its original pore system. Upon application of this new stimulation
technology, the true production potential of sandstone reservoirs
can be achieved, well tubular corrosion will be minimized, and handling
hazardous chemicals such as HF will be avoided. Most importantly,
controlling the reaction rate, by controlling the amount of exothermic
chemicals, can ensure deep acid penetration as well.

1 Introduction
The term “formation
damage” refers to the decrease
in the formation permeability by different improper activities. Operationally
and economically, formation damage is considered an undesirable problem
that is expected to take place at any stage of the reservoir life.1 As expressed by Amaerule et al.,2 “formation damage is an expensive headache to the
oil and gas industry”. Bennion3 described
formation damage as, “the impairment of the invisible, by the
inevitable and uncontrollable, resulting in an indeterminate reduction
of the unquantifiable!”

Formation acidizing and hydraulic
fracturing are both two common
solutions to mitigate the formation damage problem. The hydraulic
fracturing process aims to bypass the damaged zone around the wellbore
by creating a high permeability path within the reservoir that is
connected to the well.4−6 On the other hand, acidizing treatment aims generally
to enhance the well productivity by either dissolving the formation
rock itself or removing the well-induced damage.7−11 Acid treatment was initially used to stimulate carbonate
reservoirs by dissolving the rock matrix.12 However, with the industry development, special types of acid were
evolved to treat sandstone reservoir damage that occurs during drilling,
completion, enhanced oil recovery, or even production period.13,14

Sandstone matrix acidizing, where the acid is injected at
a pressure
lower than the formation fracture pressure and reacts near the wellbore
area, can reach as deep as only 1 ft.15 The main goal of sandstone acidizing is not to influence a large
deep portion of the reservoir but to highly improve or restore the
near-wellbore permeability.16 Sandstone
formations are therefore commonly stimulated using hydrofluoric acid
(HF)-based systems, which may also be blended with strong mineral
acids, organic acids, esters, and combinations thereof.17−19

The process of sandstone acidizing with mud acid is quite
challenging
as it comprises various stages containing different fluids. Some precipitation
reactions could take place during any stage of sandstone acidizing.
This may harm the stimulated formation and reduce its permeability
and porosity.12,20 The sandstone acidizing process
comes in three main phases.21,22 The first stage is
called a “preflush” in which the main purpose is to
dissolve the formation carbonates and evict the inhabitant saline
water. The second stage or the mud acid stage comprises mainly injection
of HCl and HF acids with prestated concentrations. The main purpose
of this stage is to get rid of all the near-wellbore materials that
thought to be restricting the production such as clays and feldspars.
Finally, the “after flush” stage which aims at pushing
the mud acid stage further into the reservoir and wash out the byproducts
resulted from the previous reactions. The chemicals used in this final
stage can vary between hydrochloric acid (HCl), ammonium chloride
(NH4Cl), or even a pure hydrocarbon solvent such as diesel
oil.

The reaction of mud acid with sandstone formations is a
fast reaction,
and the acid is spent quickly before reaching the proper depth.23 Fines migration would probably occur after mud
acid treatment and restore the formation damage. The reaction of HF
with silicate minerals produces fluosilicic acid that reacts with
the different cations present in the formation and produces precipitates
such as CaSiF6, Na2SiF6, and K2SiF6.24−26 In addition to the reservoir
problems caused using conventional HF, surface handling of the stimulating
chemicals is very risky to the working crew and to the equipment.
Both HF and HCl are highly corrosive and require high safety precautions
to deal with.27

The first trial of
sandstone formation acidizing using a mixture
of HCl and HF was run by Halliburton in 1933 in Texas. Unexpectedly,
the results were disappointing and discouraging. After that, in 1939,
a mixture of 12% HCl–3% HF was introduced under the name of
“mud acid” or “regular strength mud acid”
and it gave promising results once pumped downhole.28 Because silica is the main mineral constituent of sandstone,
its reaction with HF at low temperatures occurs at a low rate.29 On the other hand, aluminosilicates such as
clays and feldspars react rapidly with mud acid throughout a three-stage
reaction to produce some insoluble precipitates as shown in the following
reaction equations (eqs 1–3).30−32 1  

Then the produced fluosilicic acid reacts with different aluminosilicates
such as potassium feldspars throughout a secondary reaction as follows 2  

After that,
the ratio of fluorine (F)/aluminum (Al) continues to
decrease in the aluminum fluoride compounds because of their reaction
with aluminosilicate compounds in the presence of HCl. This reaction
chelates the aluminum ions from the aluminosilicates leaving silica
gel as a precipitate as following 3  

The previous
three stages of the reaction of sandstone rock minerals
with conventional mud acid take place along the offset distance from
the well into the reservoir (Figure 1). The primary stage is near the wellbore where the
aluminum and silica fluorides are produced. The secondary stage is
where the primary products go under slow reaction to form silica gel
which preprecipitates in the reservoir. Further away from the well,
a tertiary reaction takes place where more precipitating silica gel
is produced. This gives an indication of the failure potential of
the sandstone stimulation process with the conventional mud acid method.

Figure 1 Three
stages of the reaction of mud acid with the sandstone matrix.

To solve the problems associated with stimulating
sandstone formations
using conventional mud acids, some trials were made to find more appropriate
alternatives for mud acid. Templeton et al.33 proposed the approach of self-generating in situ HF. Templeton et
al. used a water-soluble fluoride salt (e.g., ammonium fluoride) along
with an organic acid ester (e.g., methyl formate) in order to generate
HF as described by eqs 4 and 5. However, this method suffers from two
main issues. First, organic esters are highly flammable. Second, temporary
damage can occur during the reaction of HF with the formation clays,
which forms some insoluble products such as ralstonite.34 4   5  

In order to overcome the problem
of the quick reaction and consumption
of conventional mud acid, Gdanski35 and
Ayorinde et al.36 adopted the use of some
retarded acids such as fluoroboric acid (HBF4) and fluroaluminic
and hexa-fluro-phosphonic (HPF6) acids. The use of these
weak acids aims at increasing the depth of penetration of the acid
treatment by generating HF at a slower rate. The preliminary results
of this approach are better than the use of conventional mud acid.
However, the acid depth of penetration was not highly increased and
the formation consolidation problem along with the unwanted precipitation
of HF reactions with sandstone minerals are not retarded that much.27

Rogers et al.37 proposed the formulation
consisting of 10% citric acid along with 1.5% HF without any further
additives for stimulating sandstone formations containing the zeolite
mineral. The proposed formulation showed an effective dissolution
to the zeolite particles without creating silica gel precipitation.
This could prevent the postdamage problem caused by conventional mud
acid treatment. However, the used HF did not penetrate deep into the
formation and reacted only with the shallow damage and scale deposits
around the wellbore.34 Al-Dahlan et al.29 used the phosphonic acid-based retarded HF (PRHF)
system to stimulate sandstone formations. The results show that the
PRHF could not extract the calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) ions from
the clay minerals.

Mahmoud et al.26 used 20 wt % GLDA (glutamic
acid-N, N-diacetic acid) combined
with 1 wt % HF to stimulate different sandstone cores. Computed tomography
scans showed a reduction in the CT number values because of precipitation
of CaF2. Al-Harbi et al.38 used
solutions of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) containing ammonium
bi-fluoride with sandstone cores. The amount of AlF3 precipitated
was a strong function of the Al/F ratio in the solution. Li et al.39 introduced a new acid system that consists of
a combination of chelating agents, phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and NH4F for high-temperature applications for
sandstone reservoirs. The new acid system has a low corrosion rate
and prevented the precipitation of CaF2.

Karale et
al.40 used a pH buffer solution
to activate an exothermic reaction downhole. They used sodium nitrite
and ammonium chloride as the main reactants for their exothermic reactions.
One of the reactants can be injected to the formation first or both
can go together, and then, a pH buffer solution with the pH value
less than 4 is injected to activate the exothermic reaction described
by eq 6. The generated
heat increases the formation temperature and in turn increases the
acid reaction rate. This method was initially developed for increasing
the efficiency of acidizing low-temperature dolomite formations. Al-Nakhli
et al.41 proposed the use of thermochemical
reaction as a novel cost-effective method for heavy oil recovery.
This new approach is called the ExoClean technique that provides in
situ steam generation for thermal recovery of deep oil wells. They
reported the increase in system pressure and temperature to be 3470
psi and 600 °F, respectively, after the reaction is completed. 6  

Alade et al.42 used the concept
of thermochemical
reactions for enhancing the production of heavy oil and condensate
reservoirs. They evaluated the kinetics and energy associated with
the thermochemical reaction and concluded that the initial temperature
highly affects the reaction rate. The reaction duration decreased
from almost 18 min under the ambient temperature of 20 °C to
about 6 min under 75 °C. Moreover, the change in enthalpy ΔH
for this chemical reaction was 369 kJ mol–1, regardless
of the operating temperatures.

A recently adopted technique
for generating HF involves the oxidation
of ammonium fluoride salt with a strong oxidizer. This oxidation reaction
is an autocatalytic reaction that requires heat to initiate. Hull
et al.43 used sodium bromates (NaBrO3) as a powerful oxidizer to react with ammonium fluoride and
produce HF according to eq 7. This reaction requires heating the reaction medium up to
150 °C for 3 h in order to produce a transparent solution. 7  

The main objectives of this work are
to overcome the drawbacks
of conventional mud acid treatment by adopting a novel approach of
generating an in situ HF system. This is accomplished by combining
what Hull et al.43 and Karale et al.40 did together. In other words, this research
aims at combining the application of thermochemical reaction that
can generate heat up to 200 °F with the application of oxidizing
ammonium fluoride salt under high temperature in order to generate
in situ HF. Combing the two mentioned concepts together would help
in generating the heat required for the endothermic oxidation reaction
of ammonium fluoride, producing a high-pressure pulse that is capable
of removing any byproduct precipitation. Nitrogen gas is also expected
to be produced which would be of a good benefit for diverting the
acid solution during the acidizing treatment. The generated acid will
be used to remove the damage from the sandstone formations, while
the generated pressure pulse provided enough energy to flow back the
well and create some microfractures.

In order to achieve the
objectives of this work, all the required
materials were first prepared, including the thermochemical fluids,
the acid-generating fluids, pure quartz samples, and sandstone core
samples. The general methodology followed was to ensure the validity
of the proposed concept by carrying out different tests and measurements
such as the quartz solubility test, core flooding experiments, inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, NMR scans, and finally scratch tests.
These tests evaluate different chemical, petrophysical, and mechanical
parameters of the used chemicals and rock samples.

2 Results and Discussion
The initial results of adding the
in situ acid-generating fluids
and the thermochemicals to the aging cell along with the quartz samples
for 24 h at a temperature of 90 °C showed a change in the quartz
sample weight from 3.4040 to 3.3235 g with some notches on the surface
of the quartz sample (Figure 2a,b). This reduction in the quartz weight by 80.5 mg proved
the formation of HF that can dissolve the silicate minerals and reduce
the quartz weight. Moreover, these notches observed on the sample
surface indicate the active reaction zone between the generated HF
and the silica mineral. The ICP results of the experiment final solution
showed a silicon ion (Si+) concentration of 91.43 ppm.
The heat is not only the desirable product out of the exothermic reaction.
Nitrogen gas (N2) also evolves and increases the system
pressure by 600 psi.

reactions with a weight of 3.3235 g with notches on the surface because

The Gray Berea sandstone
core and the saturating fluid properties
are listed in Table 1. The elemental composition of the Gray Berea sandstone cores using
the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis is listed in Table 2, while the mineralogy analysis
of the core is shown in Figure 3. As expected, Si and O2 represent the most abundant
elements in the Berea rock sample. This is reflected by the high quartz
content that the core possesses which reaches up to 87%. The core
is also distinguished by the high potassium content present in the
potassium feldspars. Because the dry weight of the Berea core is about
356.6 g, it must contain an amount of quartz that weighs about 310
g.

The initial
core permeability was measured using the 3 wt % KCl
solution. At a stabilized flow rate of 2 cm3/min, the core
permeability was calculated to be 33 mD. Flushing the core with 5
PV HCl, having a concentration of 7 wt %, led to a decrease in the
core permeability to 31 mD (the core lost about 4.8% of its original
permeability). This can be attributed to the reaction of HCl with
the clay minerals (chlorite, illite, and kaolinite) existing in the
core. This matches with the observations of Thomas et al.44 and Kamal et al.45 about the effect of HCl acid on the clay-containing rocks. HCl reacts
with chlorite to produce ferric hydroxide which is a gel material
that can plug the pore throats. Also, HCl reacts with both illite
and kaolinite and causes fines migration. The main treatment started
by injecting 0.5 PV of the acid-generating solutions (ammonium fluoride
and sodium bromates) followed by 0.5 PV of the exothermic chemicals
(ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite). The system temperature is
then increased to 90 °C to initiate the exothermic reaction.
The inlet and outlet valves of the core are then closed, and the first
soaking period of about 30 min was performed. The core inlet pressure
started to increase, indicating the start of the exothermic reaction.
The maximum reached inlet pressure during this stage was about 611
psi. The same flushing and soaking procedures were followed during
the second and third cycles. The increase in the inlet pressure during
the second and third cycles was 456 and 424, respectively. The inlet
pressure profile corresponding to each flooding stage is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Inlet pressure profile
measured in psi during the whole treatment
process of the Gray Berea sandstone core.

Core permeability has increased immediately after the first treatment
cycle and reached 41 mD. After the second cycle, the permeability
increased more and reached about 44 mD. No noticeable change in the
core permeability was found after the third treatment cycle. Finally,
the core is flushed by 3 wt % KCl from the reverse direction (backflow)
and the final permeability was measured. The final permeability measurement
showed an enhancement in the core permeability by about 40%. All the
effluents were collected for ICP-optical emission spectrometry (OES)
analysis to determine the total amount of the dissolved Si+ ions. The permeability measurement after each flooding stage is
shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Core permeability
values measured in mD as calculated after each
treatment cycle.

The ICP-OES results showed
the presence of Si+ ions
in each effluent after each treatment stage. This again proves the
generation of HF inside the Berea sandstone core. Figure 6 shows the cumulative amount
of the chelated Si+ ions from the core after each treatment
cycle. There is a gradual increase in the cumulative amount of the
chelated Si+ ions after the first two cycles. However,
there was a sharp increase in the amount of the Si+ ions
chelated from the core after the third cycle. This is also clear from
analyzing the effluent from the after flush stage. The reason behind
this is the maturity of the reaction after the first two cycles and
the ability of the injected chemical to be exposed to a larger area
of the rock. The total chelated amount of Si+ ions from
the core reached 10.5 mg. This is corresponding to a total dissolved
amount of 22.5 mg of quartz (silica). This could be the reason behind
the permeability enhancement of the Gray Berea sandstone core after
this treatment process.

Figure 6 Cumulative amount of Si chelated from the Gray
Berea core after
each treatment cycle.

NMR measurements for
the Gray Berea core before and after the treatment
showed an increase in the core final porosity. This is attributed
to the amount of silica and other minerals that were dissolved from
the core by the generated acid. Moreover, the NMR measurement did
not exhibit any change in the core pore system which indicates no
plugging created. As shown in Figure 7, the relaxation time (T2) curves of the core before and after the treatment represent only
one main peak. This means that the core preserved its integrity and
no other pore systems were created, just the existing pores were enlarged.
The major T2 value for the fresh core
was about 158 ms, while it reached more than 280 ms after acidizing
treatment. This indicates that the enlargement happened to the core
pore system after the in situ acid treatment.

Figure 7 T2 relation time measured by the NMR
technique for both fresh and acidized Gray Berea cores.

Another way that can confirm the core integrity after the
acidizing
treatment is the results of the scratch test. These results show an
enhancement in the rock mechanical parameters such as uniaxial compressive
strength (UCS), sonic parameters (compressional and shear waves),
and the dynamic elastic parameters (dynamic Young’s modulus
and Poisson’s ratio). Figures 8 and 9 show the scratched cores
with the groove created along the core whole length. The UCS value
increased by about 1800 psi after the acid treatment as shown in Figure 10. The compressional
wave velocity increased from 2471 m/s to about 3227 m/s, while the
shear wave velocity increased from 1558 m/s to about 1987 m/s (Figure 11). The increase
in the sonic waves is reflected by an increase in Young’s modulus
and Poisson’s ratio by about 1400 ksi and 0.02, respectively
(Figures 12 and 13).

Berea SS
core with the recorded rock strength in MPa.

core with the recorded rock strength in MPa.

Young’s modulus of the Gray Berea core measured
in ksi before and after the acid treatment.

Figure 13 Dynamic
Poisson’s ratio of the Gray Berea core measured
before and after the acid treatment.

The increase in the rock mechanical strength can be attributed
to the generation of the fluoboric acid from the reaction of the excess
amount of HF generated with the brome source (NaBrO3) as
described by eq 8.46 The generated fluoboric acid can react with
the potassium source in the Gray Berea core and form a solid precipitate
of potassium tetrafluoborate (KBF4) under high-temperature
conditions. This solidification occurring inside the core is the main
reason for increasing the core strength. Moreover, the heat generated
from the exothermic reaction could increase the strength of sandstone
samples.47 8  

3 Summary and Conclusions
Sandstone formations
have a complex mineral composition consisting
of silica, calcite, feldspars, and clays. The stimulation of sandstone
formation using conventional mud acid is a risky job that can increase
the formation damage rather than enhancing the formation productivity.
In this work, a novel approach for acidizing sandstone formations
using in situ-generated HF has been developed. An acid precursor (ammonium
fluoride NH4F) reacted with a suitable oxidizer (sodium
bromates NaBrO3) in an exothermic reaction. In addition,
it produces a high-pressure pulse (about 600 psi) accompanied by the
evolving nitrogen gas. This helps to evict any potential precipitations
that may result from the acidizing treatment. The following are the
main conclusions that can be drawn from this study:The in situ-generated HF could dissolve
the silica minerals
from the quartz sample.

A Gray Berea
sandstone core was successfully stimulated
using core flooding. The core permeability got enhanced by about 40%
with a final permeability value of 44 mD compared to an initial permeability
of 31 mD.

The ICP analysis of the core
flooding effluent showed
a total amount of 10.5 mg of silicon chelated from the core.

The NMR measurement for the stimulated core
before and
after the treatment showed an increase in the core porosity because
of the minerals dissolved.

The scratch
test results showed an enhancement in the
core mechanical properties because of the solidification reaction
that took place between the injected chemicals and the potassium mineral
in the Berea core.

The core UCS value
increased by about 2200 psi after
the acid treatment, while the dynamic Young’s modulus and Poisson’s
ratio increased by about 1400 ksi and 0.02, respectively.



Besides the generated acid, the produced
temperature and pressure
will increase the acidizing process efficiency and the acid depth
of penetration. This approach will, additionally, eliminate all the
hazards and high safety precautions taken during the mud acid treatment.
All the injected chemicals are environmentally friendly and do not
cause any harm to the well.

4 Recommendations for Future
Work
In order to maximize the output from this research,
the following
points are highly advised to be taken into consideration:Carrying out the core flooding tests
with longer cores
(1 ft or more) in order to get a representative response like that
of an actual well.

Examining more types
of sandstone formations with different
quartz and clay contents to check the effect of the novel fluid mixture
on them.

Carrying out thin-section analysis
for the tested sandstone
cores in order to characterize the nature of their clay content and
know if they will be affected with the acid flow path.



5 Experimental Section
The methodology
of this research can be divided into different
phases. Each phase is carried out separately in order to evaluate
the stated approach for generating the in situ HF and stimulating
the sandstone formations.

5.1 Chemical Preparation and
Quartz Dissolution
In this stage, a pure quartz sample is
tested with the proposed
chemical mixture to check the concept of HF generation. The pure quartz
is used to avoid any reaction complication because of the impurities,
clays, and feldspars that may exist in sandstone cores. The concentration
of the thermochemical reactants (NH4Cl & NaNO2) is kept constant for this stage at the basis of a 1:1 molar ratio.
The molar ratio of the sodium bromate to the ammonium fluoride was
1:2. The quartz samples were weighed by using a digital balance with
a high accuracy of up to 0.1 mg. Then, the samples were dispersed
with the chemical mixtures in Teflon liners. The mixtures were stirred
for a specific period and then kept in aging cells and placed in a
digital oven for 24 h under a temperature of 90 °C (Figure 14). After that,
the aging cells were removed from the oven to cool down and the remaining
quartz is weighed to check for any weight change while the effluent
was tested by ICP-OES for the concentration of Si+ ions.

cell with a Teflon liner (on the right) where the pure quartz
samples are mixed with the chemical compounds and sealed to withstand
the high pressure generated. The cell is then kept in the electrical
oven (on the left) at a temperature of 90 °C for 24 h.

5.2 Core Flooding
In this stage, core
flooding was conducted using Gray Berea sandstone cores. The Gray
Berea core represents sandstone formations with moderate to high permeability.
The core flooding system consists of a high-pressure syringe pump
used to transfer the injected fluids from three transfer cells. A
sandstone core of 6 in. length and 1.5 in. diameter was placed in
a core holder that is preserved in an oven. The inlet and outlet pressures
of the core are continuously measured by pressure transducers that
are connected to an automatic data acquisition system “OMEGA”.
A constant back-pressure of 366 psi is imposed on the flow system
to ensure homogeneous flow within the core (Figure 15).

Figure 15 Core flooding system used for stimulating the
Gray Berea sandstone
cores.

The sandstone treatment process
had different stages. First, a
solution of 3 wt % KCl is injected continuously at a constant rate
until the steady-state flow is achieved. The KCl concentration was
chosen based on the recommendations of Schneider48 to increase the clay stability. For the Gray Berea core,
the flow rate was set to be 2 cm3/min. The pressure drop
during this stage is used to calculate the core initial permeability
using eq 9. A preflush
stage of 5 PV of 7 wt % HCl is injected to dissolve any calcite content
that may exist in the core. The concentration of the preflush acid
was determined based on the recommendations of McLeod and Norman.49 The core permeability is measured using the
3 wt % of KCl solution to determine the amount of damage occurred
to the core after the HCl flooding stage. After that, the core is
flushed by 1 PV of the main chemical mixture and left for soaking
for about 30 min. There are two options to activate the exothermic
chemical reaction: whether to increase the whole system temperature
up to 90 °C or to inject acetic acid with pH ≤ 4. The
end of the soaking period is marked by the end of the chemical reaction.
The flushing and soaking cycle is repeated for 3 successive cycles.
Finally, the final core permeability is measured by the backflow of
the 3 wt % KCl solution. All the effluents produced during the treatment
process are kept for analyzing the Si+ ions using the ICP-OES
system. 9  where K is the core

in mD, q is the flow rate in cm3/min,
μ is the injected fluid viscosity in cP, L is

core in psi.

5.3 Pore System and Core Integrity
Evaluation
The pore system and rock mechanical properties
are evaluated before
and after the coreflooding test using the NMR technique and the scratch
test. The Oxford Geospec NMR rock core analyzer is used for scanning
the core with the NMR technique before and after the flooding. This
version comes with an operating frequency of 2 MHz. It has two different
cells, the standard one that can withstand samples of 2 in. diameter
and 5 in. length. The other “P5 Overburden cell” can
withstand samples of 1.5 in. diameter and 2 in. length. The maximum
working pressure and temperature of this device are 5000 psi and 100
°C, respectively. The core was first saturated with brine solution,
and then, the scanning process took place. The T2 relaxation time is recorded to give an indication of the
pore size distribution and the different pore size systems that may
exist in the rock.

The scratch test equipment was used to assess
the core mechanical property change after the stimulation treatment.
The scratch test involves creating a groove on a surface of a specimen
using a cutter. The test is carried out under a highly controlled
kinematic process as the cutting depth and the cutter speed are highly
controlled and kept constant. The groove depth reaches only 1 mm or
less, depending on the sample strength. While scratching the sample,
the force applied on the cutter is monitored and then interpreted
to give an indication of the rock strength and the UCS value.50 The test is conducted along the entire specimen
length. The cutter in this test has a width of 10 mm with a back-rake
angle of 15° and a velocity of 4 mm/s. By using the sonic mode
in the machine, the compressional and shear waves (VP and VS) are measured along
the sample length. The values of the sonic waves along with the rock
density (ρ) can be used to calculate the dynamic elastic properties
of the rock sample by using the following two eqs 10 and 11. 10   11
