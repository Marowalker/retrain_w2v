This
study aims to synthesize novel fused spiro-4H-pyran
derivatives under green conditions to develop agents having
antimicrobial activity. The synthesized compounds were initially screened
for in vitro antibacterial activity against two Gram-positive and
three Gram-negative bacterial strains, and all the compounds exhibited
moderate to potent antibacterial activity. However, compound 4l showed significant inhibition toward all the bacterial
strains, particularly against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli with minimum
inhibitory concentration values of 125 μg/mL for each. The toxicity
studies of selected
compounds (4c, 4e, 4l, and 4m) using human red blood cells as well as human embryonic
kidney (HEK-293) cells showed nontoxic behavior at desired concentration.
Growth kinetic and time–kill curve studies of 4l against S. pneumoniae and E. coli supported its bactericidal nature. Interestingly,
compound 4l showed a synergistic effect when used in
combination with ciprofloxacin against selected strains. Biofilm formation
in the presence of a lead compound, as assessed by XTT assay, showed
complete disruption of the bacterial biofilm visualized by scanning
electron microscopy. Overall, the findings suggest 4l to be considered as a promising lead for further development as
an antibacterial agent.

Introduction
Over the past decades,
bacterial resistance toward commonly used
antibiotics is an epidemic health plague worldwide, and it might become
a serious threat to public health.1 World
Health Organization (WHO) has pointed out that the infections caused
by resistant bacteria may increase severe complications for the health
of the community in a near future or even death.2 Additionally, biofilm formation also plays an important
role in bacterial infection as well as drug resistance. Reports suggested
that biofilm formation causes more than 80% of bacterial infections.3 A number of bacterial infections such as periodontitis,
endocarditis, chronic lung infections, skin infections, etc., occur
due to biofilm formation on biotic surfaces.4 Biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces such as catheters, surgical
instruments, and other medical equipment lead to nosocomial infections.5 Such problems have constantly emerged due to
the limitation of nontoxic and effective antibacterial drugs and their
overuse in medical treatments and animal farming.6 Recently, different classes of compounds such as peptides,
small-molecule inhibitors, and fatty acid conjugates are reported
as antibacterial agents, which directly act on the biofilm.7−9 The new discovery of appropriate antibiotics has been vital to human
survival especially for immune-compromised patients and patients with
AIDS because all microbes are resistant to almost all presented drugs.10 In the present scenario, the development of
newly discovered antibiotics speedily reduced after the great discovery
of penicillin in 1950s and 1960s.11 Currently,
the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus responsible for health care-associated soft tissue infections is
the most studied pathogens.12 This clinically
isolated S. aureus bacterium has developed
resistant to the generally recommended antibiotics including β-lactams such as oxacillin, ampicillin as well as methicillin.13 One the other hand, the Enterococcus
faecium bacterial strain is also resistant to vancomycin
drug, which is almost the last remedy to multidrug resistant bacterial
strains.14 Therefore, it is clear that
the rapid development of effective antibacterial agents with an innovative
and alternative mode of action to cure drug-resistant bacterial infections
urgently solicited.

Spirocyclic core containing compounds has
pronounced pharmacological
activities and widely present in numerous natural and biologically
active molecules.15 It is a clear fact
that the presence of a spiro carbon in a molecule leads to structural
rigidity, which significantly influences the biological activities.
Especially, the oxindole core containing a spirocyclic stereo center
at the C-3 position embodies a privileged heterocyclic scaffold found
in natural products as well as synthetic pharmaceuticals.16 Spirooxindoles containing a pyran ring have
drawn noteworthy attention to organic as well as medicinal chemists
due to their varied range of pharmacological activities including
antimicrobial,17 antimycobacterial,18 antifungal,19 anticancer,20 antioxidant,21 and
photochromic properties.22 Similarly, 4H-pyran fused with dimedone/chromenes containing isatins
showed a broad range of biological properties such as anticoagulant,
spasmolytic, antioxidant, antibacterial, and diuretic activities.23−25 Recently, Zarei et al. synthesized mono- and bis-spiro-4H-pyran and reported biological studies of the synthesized
compounds.26 They have also described that
the spiro-4H-pyran derivatives bearing dimedone and
isatin motifs have eminent antioxidant efficacies and exhibited strong
antibacterial activities against the Escherichia coli bacterial strain compared to the positive control gentamicin. The
naturally occurring alkaloids, for example, (+)-calanolide A and rhodomyrtone
have also fused pyran and pyranocoumarin motifs (Figure 1).27 Similarly, the compounds pyranokunthone B and 4H-pyranonaphthoquinone (α-lapachones) exhibit antimalarial and
antitumor activity, respectively, while zanamivir is used as a medication
for the treatment of influenza caused by influenza A and B viruses
(Figure 1).28,29

active 1,4-naphthaquinone derivatives and comparison with target compounds.

Recently, (E)-N-methyl-1-(methylthio)-2-nitroethenamine
(NMSM) has drawn significant attention as an important synergistic
building block due to the presence of push–pull skeleton for
the synthesis of various O/N-heterocyclic ring systems via multicomponent
reactions (MCRs).30 By using an MCR strategy
and NMSM as a building block, we have synthesized 4H-chromen-5-ones and N-methyl-1,4-dihydropyridines
under neat conditions.31 Therefore, in
continuation of our effort to develop green and sustainable methods
for the synthesis of small heterocycles having biological activities,32,33 herein, we investigate an expedient, environmentally benevolent,
regioselective three-component reaction for the preparation of spiro-4H-pyrans using oxygen containing 1,3-dinucleophilic sources
(cyclic-1,3-diketone, 4-hydroxycoumarin, and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthaquinone),
isatins, and NMSM under catalyst-free conditions as an antibacterial
agent (Scheme 1).

the One-Pot Synthesis of Novel Fused Spiro 4H-Pyrans
Results and Discussion
Chemistry
Initially,
we have chosen dimedone 1a (1.0 mmol), isatin 2a (1.0 mmol), and NMSM 3a (1.0 mmol) as model substrates
to optimize the reaction
conditions, and for the same model substrates, a number of trial reactions
were performed (Table 1). In our initial endeavor using 10 mol % of I2, the reaction
was carried out at room temperature for 24 h as well as on refluxing
in ethanol for 8 h and provided product 4a in 28 and
84% yield, respectively (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). The proposed structure was confirmed by
spectroscopic techniques such as IR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR. The 1H NMR spectrum of 4a showed characteristic
two signals of the N–H proton at δ = 10.45 and 10.48
ppm, and 13C NMR spectra revealed a signal at δ =
48.5 ppm for spiro carbon of the newly formed 4H-pyran
ring. On the other hand, the IR vibrational stretching frequencies
and HRMS data also supported our obtained product as 4a.

Encouraged by these above results, other acidic and
basic catalysts
were screened, using piperidine, DBU, p-TSA, AcOH,
and l-proline (10 mol % of each) at refluxing ethanol, which
provided the isolated yields of 4a as 40, 25, 79, 72,
and 66%, respectively (Table 1, entries 3–7). Interestingly, the best yield of compound 4a as 89% was achieved when the reaction was performed without
a catalyst in refluxing ethanol for 5 h (Table 1, entry 8). Next, to examine the solvent
effect, the same model reaction was screened with different solvents
or mixed solvents. We have observed that changing the solvent fails
to improve the yield of the desired product (Table 1, entries 9–14). Thus, the catalyst-free
conditions under refluxing ethanol emerge as optimal reaction conditions
in terms of time and yield.

After getting the optimized reaction
conditions in hand, we are
delighted to extend our investigation toward assessing the generality
of this protocol. For the same conditions, the different reactions
were performed by using dimedone and NMSM with other isatin derivatives
bearing functionalities such as 5-NO2, 5-Br, 5-Cl, and N-Me. All the reactions ensued smoothly to accomplish the
desired products (4b–4e) with good
yields (83–88%) (Table 2).

conditions: 1,3-dinucleophilic

b Isolated yields.

Again, we carried out the reaction
of cyclohexane-1,3-dione and
5-H/5-Cl/5-NO2 isatin with NMSM under optimized reaction
conditions, which yielded the corresponding products 4f, 4g, and 4h with yields 88, 87, and 86%,
respectively. Further, the feasibility of this reaction was also examined
with other analogues of 1,3-dinucleophilic oxygen sources such as
4-hydroxycoumarin and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthaquinone with isatin derivatives
and NMSM under optimal conditions. We were fruitful in isolating corresponding
products 4i–4m in good yield (70–80%)
as shown in Table 2.

The newly synthesized spiro-4H-pyran derivatives
were fully characterized by standard spectroscopic techniques such
as IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, HRMS, and elemental
analysis. Finally, the structure of the compound 4e was
unambiguously confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis (CCDC 1887180).
A colorless single crystal was grown by slow evaporation of the CH3CN solvent, and the crystal was mounted for X-ray crystallography
on a glass fiber. The
ORTEP depiction of the representative compound 4e is
shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 ORTEP
representation of compound 4e (CCDC 1887180).

The formation of compounds can be rationalized via a domino
reaction
pathway as illustrated with a plausible mechanism shown in Scheme 2. The first step
is conceivable and simple condensation of dimedone (oxygen containing
1,3-dinucleophilic sources) with isatin to give a Knoevenagel condensate I, which underwent Michael-type addition with NMSM to an intermediate II. Then, the intermediate II undergoes imine–enamine
tautomerism and leads to the formation of species III. Again, the intramolecular O-cyclization of species III furnished compound 4a via intermediate IV by the elimination of −MeSH. But during our investigation,
we did not perceive 4a′ even in a trace amount,
thereby rendering our protocol highly regioselective.

In Vitro Antibacterial
Activity
The inhibitory potential
of synthesized compounds 4a–4m was
evaluated against two Gram-positive, (Streptococcus
pneumoniae MTCC 655 and Enterococcus
faecalis MTCC 439) and three Gram-negative (E. coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella typhimurium MTCC 3224, and Pseudomonas auroginosa MTCC 2453) bacterial strains. Initially, in vitro screening was
performed at 250 μg/mL as the single highest concentration to
identify potent compounds and excluded those compounds that are ineffective
at this concentration. At this concentration, compounds 4c and 4e were found to be selective inhibitors of P. auroginosa with complete growth inhibition. Similarly,
compound 4m selectively inhibited S. typhimurium and S. pneumoniae with 100% growth
inhibition. Among all, compound 4l emerged as the lead
molecule, which showed complete inhibition of all the bacterial strains
used in this study (Table 3).

Further, based on above observation,
we selected compounds 4c, 4e, 4l, and 4m to
calculate minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value (in μg/mL)
against those bacterial strains, which are completely inhibited at
250 μg/mL. Compounds 4c and 4e showed
moderate activity with MIC values of 250 μg/mL for each against P. auroginosa. Similarly, compound 4m showed moderate activity against S. typhimurium with an MIC value of 250 μg/mL and good activity against S. pneumoniae with an MIC value of 125 μg/mL as shown
in Table 4.

Interestingly,
compound 4l showed significantly good
inhibition of all the bacterial strains, particularly against S. pneumoniae and E. coli with an MIC value of 125 μg/mL. Therefore, compound 4l with potent selective inhibition of bacterial strains was
selected for further pharmacological investigations.

The minimum
bactericidal concentration (MBC) was determined to
explore the killing efficiency of compounds against selected strains.
The bactericidal property of compounds was determined up to the three
generations of bacteria. The results showed that P.
auroginosa is a more sensitive bacterial strain to
such spiro-4H-pyran-based compounds. The MBC values
of compounds 4c and 4e were determined as
≤500 μg/mL, while for 4l, it was noted as
≤250 μg/mL. Compound 4m also showed a good
killing effect with an MBC value of ≤500 μg/mL against S. typhimurium and S. pneumoniae bacterial strains (Table 5).

Structure–Activity
Relationship
Based on aforementioned
data of Table 3 and Table 4, the following conventions
could be presumed about the preliminary structural–activity
relationship (SAR). It is quite clear from the above results that
the fusion of the spiro-4H-pyran core ring with 1,3-dinucleophilic
oxygen containing compounds had a pronounced influence on antibacterial
activity. The compounds in which the 4H-pyran ring
has fused by 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthaquinone (4l and 4m) showed a good antibacterial activity as compare to the
compounds having fusion of dimedone. While the fusion of the core
4H-pyran ring by 4-hydroxycoumarin (4i– 4k) displayed moderate activity. In general,
it is perceived that the fusion of dimedone, 4-hydroxycoumarin, and
2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthaquinone with the 4H-pyran ring
plays a dynamic role in the antibacterial activity.

Hemolytic
and Cytotoxicity Assays
The cytotoxicity
of selected compounds, that is, 4c, 4e, 4l, and 4m, was determined by hemolytic assay
on human red blood cells (RBCs). Ciprofloxacin was used as the reference
drug (Figure 3A). Approximately
30 to 40% cell lysis was observed at 400 μg/mL concentration
of compounds. Although at higher concentration, that is, at 400 μg/mL,
the hemolytic activity of compound 4l showed slightly
high toxicity with 32% cell lysis than ciprofloxacin, but at lower
concentration, it showed comparability to less or almost equal hemolysis.
Compound 4l at 200 and 100 μg/mL (conc. near its
MIC values) showed 20 and 13% cell lysis, respectively. Thus, results
indicated negligible toxicity of the tested compounds, especially 4l, which showed potent antibacterial activity. Further, to
extend the cytotoxicity evaluation on the human normal cell line,
the synthesized compounds were also evaluated on HEK-293 cells using
MTT assay. The selected compounds were tested in a concentration range
of 0–400 μg/mL for 48 h, and interestingly, it was found
that the treatment of these compounds does not affect the viability
of the HEK-293 cell even at more than 200 μg/mL concentration.
However, in the case of compounds 4e and 4m, minor cytotoxicity was observed at higher concentration (400 μg/mL).
The cell cytotoxicity results suggested that the selected compounds
are noncytotoxic to normal human cells in the studied concentration
range (Figure 3B).

(B) Cell viability of HEK-293 cells incubated with increasing concentrations

Disk Diffusion Assay
The antibacterial potential of
compound 4l was also determined by disk diffusion assay
on a solid nutrient agar medium at the concentration corresponding
to 0.5MIC (62.5 μg/mL), MIC (125 μg/mL), and 2MIC (250
μg/mL).

The dose-dependent zones of clearance were observed
in the presence of various concentrations of test compound 4l. Moreover, 18, 17, and 14 mm clear zones of inhibition with an additional
3 ± 1 mm opaque zone of inhibition with a standard deviation
of 0.47 were measured around the disk of 2MIC, MIC, and 0.5MIC, respectively,
on the lawn culture of E. coli. Similarly,
17, 15, and 14 mm clear zones of inhibition with an additional 3 ±
1 mm opaque zone of inhibition with a standard deviation of 0.47 were
measured around the disk of 2MIC, MIC, and 0.5MIC, respectively, on
the lawn culture of S. pneumoniae (Figure 4). The results indicated
the inhibitory potential of 4l at various tested concentrations.

Spot Assay
The
viability of bacterial cells in the
presence of various concentrations of test compound 4l was also determined by the spot assay. The bacterial cells were
exposed for 6 h to the test compound 4l and cultured
on a nutrient agar medium.

The results shown in Figure 5 clearly indicated the bactericidal
nature of compound, which significantly affects the viability of E. coli and S. pneumoniae even in 6 h. A confluent growth of E. coli and S. pneumoniae at 0.5MIC showed
no visible effect on the cell, but at higher concentration, that is,
MIC and 2MIC, significant inhibition occurred. Moreover, no S. pneumoniae growth was observed after treated with
2MIC of 4l. The experiment was performed in triplicate
at three different times.

(−) sign as
(i) untreated and treated with (ii) 0.5 MIC, (iii) MIC, and (iv) 2MIC
of compound 4l for (a) E. coli and (b) S. pneumoniae.

Growth Kinetic Studies
To investigate the effect of
the potent compound 4l on the growth of S. pneumoniae and E. coli bacterial cells, growth kinetic studies were accomplished. The bacterial
cells were exposed to different concentrations of the test compound
(2MIC, MIC, and 0.5MIC). Ciprofloxacin-treated cells were used as
a positive control, and untreated cells were used as a negative control.
The growth curve of untreated bacterial cells showed slightly diauxic
growth with clear lag, exponential or log, brief stationary, and decline
phases of the cell cycle. The bacterial cells did not display any
substantial growth when exposed to the 2MIC and MIC of 4l with a continuous lag phase of 24 h.

However, at sub-MIC of 4l, growth was observed between 16 and 18 h in E. coli, which increased with a very slow growth
rate. Similarly, at the same concentration, that is, 0.5MIC, the growth
in S. pneumoniae was observed between
18 and 20 h. The results clearly showed the bactericidal nature of
compound 4l against both Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive
bacterial strains as no significant growth detected even after 24
h at higher concentrations. The study suggested that compound 4l is an effective inhibitor of pathogenic with tested bacterial
strains (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Growth
kinetic assay showing no growth of E. coli and S. pneumoniae at MIC and 2MIC
of 4l favors its bactericidal nature.

Time–Kill Curve Assay
To determine the bacteriostatic
or bactericidal nature of lead compound 4l, time–kill
kinetics was performed against S. pneumoniae and E. coli bacterial strains at
MIC and 2MIC.

The killing activity was observed up to 24 h.
Compound 4l showed bactericidal activity at 2MIC.

Although no complete eradication of bacterial population was observed,
significant decrease in log10 CFU/mL with respect to time
was observed at MIC. At higher concentration, which equals to 2MIC,
complete eradication of E. coli was
observed after 24 h. Similarly, in the case of S. pneumoniae, 2MIC of compound 4l almost completely killed bacterial
cells (Figure 7). Moreover,
results clearly indicated the bactericidal nature of compound 4l at higher concentration.

(b) S. pneumoniae.

Synergistic Study
In vitro synergistic antibacterial
activity of compound 4l was performed with standard drug
ciprofloxacin (CIP) against all the five strains: P.
aeruginosa, S. typhimurium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, and E. coli. Many-fold decrease
in MIC values of compound 4l was observed when used in
combination with CIP.

The results indicated that the compound 4l showed synergy with CIP against Gram-positive strains E. faecalis and S. pneumoniae with fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values of
0.27 and 0.29, respectively. Further, no synergistic relation was
found against P. aeruginosa and S. typhimurium with high FICI values, that is, 1.06
and 1.01, respectively. Moreover, partial synergistic activity was
found against E. coli with an FICI
value of 0.53 (Table 6).

a Synergy and antagonism were defined
by FIC indices of <0.5 and >4, respectively. An FIC index result
of >0.5 but <4 was considered indifferent.

Confocal Laser Microscopy
The cellular uptake of compound 4l by bacterial cells
was determined by performing confocal
laser microscopy on the E. coli strain.
A nucleic acid binding dye, DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole),
was used to stain bacterial cells. DAPI is a fluorescent dye, which
strongly binds to the A-T rich region of DNA and, upon excitation
at 358 nm, emits blue fluorescence as emission spectra at 461 nm.
Untreated as well as treated cells (exposed MIC of compound 4l for 3 h) were stained and observed under a confocal laser
microscopy. Figure 8 demonstrates that untreated cells are live and do not emit blue
fluorescence, while in the treated sample, reduction in the number
of living cells occurs. A significant number of cells emit fluorescence,
which clearly indicates cell lysis due to the presence of compound 4l. Thus, compound 4l has potent antibacterial
property, which may further be explored to develop better pharmacophore.

Biofilm Assessment by XTT Assay
Biofilm formation is
an important virulence attribute of pathogenic microorganisms. Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. pneumoniae were used to determine the effect of compound 4l on
biofilm formation. The concentrations equal to 4MIC, 2MIC, and MIC
were used to explore its biofilm inhibition activity. The results
indicated that compound 4l almost completely disrupted
biofilm formation in the Gram-positive strain S. pneumoniae even at lower concentration, which equals to its MIC value. Similarly,
97, 80, and 77% reduction in absorbance was observed, which clearly
indicates the reduction of biofilm formation in the E. coli strain. Thus, the compound 4l was found to be a potent disruptor of biofilm formation. Moreover,
at sub-MIC, that is, MIC/2, MIC/4, and MIC/8, significant reduction
in biofilm formation was observed (Figure 9).

inhibition in E. coli and S. pneumoniae in the presence of 4MIC, 2MIC, MIC,
MIC/2, MIC/4, and MIC/8 concentrations
of compound 4l.

SEM Analysis of Biofilm
The quantitative assessment
of biofilm formation by XTT assay was further examined under scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). Biofilm formation on the surface of materials
occurs due to secretion of the extracellular matrix, which primarily
consists of polysaccharide. Two concentrations equal to 2MIC and MIC
values of compound 4l were taken to compare the efficacy
against biofilm formation with untreated cells.

The cells in
untreated samples appeared in clusters and embedded in the extracellular
matrix (Figure 10a).
The sample treated with 2MIC showed very few scattered bacterial cells.
Similarly, significant damage in biofilm formation showed at MIC (Figure 10). The results
clearly indicated the inhibition of biofilm disruption after exposed
to compound 4l and strongly supported the data of the
previous experiment.

Docking Studies
Methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs)
are first-row transition metalloenzymes with five conserved metal
ion-binding residues in the active sites, which involve in the cleavage
of N-terminal methionine during protein synthesis. This process is
highly crucial for the survival of bacterial cells, which enable MetAP
as an emerging drug target for bacterial infections. Although more
information is needed to prove MetAP as a selective drug target of
compound 4l, our previous studies on heterocyclic compounds
as inhibitors of MetAP and its crucial role in post-translational
modifications of bacterial proteins prompt us to determine the binding
pattern of 4l using an in silico approach.34 Thus, docking studies were performed with MetAPs
of E. coli (PDB ID: 1c21) and S. pneumoniae (PDB ID: 4km3) to support in vitro antibacterial results.
Docking results of ligand 4l with EcMetAP and SpMetAP showed good interaction with binding
energies of −7.6 and −7.0 kcal/mol, respectively.

It interacted with MET112, GLN130, TYR234, and ASP253 residues within
the binding site of EcMetAP (Figure 11b). Moreover, MET112 is a common residue,
which also interacts with the natural substrate methionine of MetAP.
Similarly, ligand 4l interacted with ASP195, HIS199,
and HIS252 amino acid residues within the binding pocket of SpMetAP (Figure 11d). HIS199 is a metal-binding residue of SpMetAP and present in the active binding site of protein. Thus, on
the basis of docking score and interacting residues, the results clearly
indicate ligand 4l as a possible inhibitor of MetAPs
and also support in vitro antibacterial potential.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed an environmentally benevolent protocol
for the synthesis of fused spiro-4H-pyran derivatives
in good to excellent yields from the reaction of oxygen containing
cyclic-1,3-dinucleophiles, isatins, and NMSM in the absence of the
catalyst. The promising features of the presented protocol include
clean reaction profile, easy workup, avoidance of toxic catalysts,
etc. The newly synthesized compounds were tested for their in vitro
antibacterial activity, and compounds 4a–4l exhibited moderate to potent antibacterial activity against S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, E. coli, S. typhimurium, and P. auroginosa. The compound 4l showed significant inhibition of all the bacterial strains
with potent activity against S. pneumoniae and E. coli with MIC values of 125
μg/mL for each. The hemolytic and MTT assays showed the nontoxic
nature of compound on human red blood cells (hRBCs) as well as HEK-293
cells. The study suggests that compound 4l has good potential
to disrupt the biofilm formed by bacterial strains and thus may be
a possible antibacterial agent against biofilm-associated bacterial
infections. Moreover, docking results also supported candidature of
compound 4l as a possible inhibitor of bacterial MetAP
drug target for bacterial protein synthesis. Thus, the potential of
compound 4l to inhibit a broad range of pathogenic bacterial
strains prompts us to select it as a lead compound for further optimization
and SAR studies to explore its mechanistic and other biological properties.

Chemistry
Typical Procedure for the Preparation of
Spiro 4H-Pyrans (4a–4m)
In an oven-dried
10 mL round-bottom flask was charged with a mixture of isatins (1.0
mmol) and 1,3-dinucleophilic oxygen sources (cyclic-1,3-diketone,
4-hydroxycoumarin, and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthaquinone) (1.0 mmol) with
NMSM (1.0 mmol) at refluxing ethanol (5 mL). The resulting mixture
was left for stirred, and reaction progress or consumption of starting
materials was monitored by TLC. After completion of the reaction as
indicated by TLC, the resulting precipitate was cooled. Then, the
precipitate was filtered by using a Buchner funnel and washed with
a cold ethanol solvent. The crude products were recrystallized from
hot acetonitrile, which provide the pure products.

Biological Evaluation
In Vitro Screening of Synthesized Compounds
All the
synthesized compounds 4a–4m were
screened for their antibacterial properties against Gram-negative
(E. coli ATCC 25922, S. typhimurium MTCC 3224, and P. auroginosa MTCC 2453) and Gram-positive (S. pneumoniae MTCC 655 and E. faecalis MTCC 439)
bacterial strains. The sensitivity of these tested organisms toward
synthesized compounds was initially determined at 250 μg/mL
concentration. DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) was used to dissolve synthesized
compounds and appropriately diluted in a test medium. All the five
bacterial strains were grown up to a mid-log phase and diluted with
sterilized nutrient broth to achieve suspension of cells according
to McFarland standards. Inoculums (200 μL) were poured in 96-well
plates, and 250 μg/mL conc. of test compounds was added. The
plates were incubated at 37 °C and 160 rpm for 24 h. After an
incubation period, the growth was measured in terms of optical density
(O.D.) at 580 nm using a Thermo Scientific MultiskanGo plate reader.
The % inhibition of growth was measured using the following formula  where A stands
for absorbance. The experiment was repeated twice in two different
times.

Based on screening, we determined MIC values of selected
compounds for respective bacterial strains using the broth microdilution
technique according to the standard protocol for antimicrobial assessment
by CLSI.35 Ciprofloxacin (CIP) was used
as a positive control. Concentration gradient (250 to 0.122 μg/mL)
of test compounds was maintained in 100 μL of nutrient broth
medium into 96-well plates. Further, each well was inoculated with
100 μL of freshly prepared bacterial cell suspension containing
approximately 5 × 106 cells and incubated at 37 °C
with constant stirring at 160 rpm. Further, the bactericidal efficiency
of test compounds was determined by minimum bactericidal concentration
(MBC). Briefly, the cells treated with a concentration gradient from
2000 to 62.5 μg/mL selected compounds in 96-well plates were
incubated 37 °C for 24 h. After an incubation period, the 10
μL of medium from the wells in which no visible growth appeared
was transferred to 100 μL of fresh medium and incubated at 37
°C for 24 h. The MBC was determined as the concentration range
at which no growth occurred even after three generations. The experiment
was performed in triplicate.36

Cytotoxicity
Studies by Hemolytic and Cell Viability Assays
The hemolytic
activity of compounds 4c, 4e, 4l, and 4m on human RBCs was determined
according to the previously reported method.36 Briefly, human blood from a healthy individual was collected in
EDTA-containing tubes and immediately centrifuged at 2000 rpm and
room temperature for 10 min to harvest erythrocytes. The erythrocytes
were then washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution and diluted
to obtained 10% (v/v) erythrocytes/PBS suspension. The suspension
was further diluted a 1:10 ratio in the same buffer. A dilution series
of 400 to 3.125 μg/mL test compound was maintained in 100 μL
of PBS solution in microcentrifuge tubes and introduced to the same
value of diluted erythrocytes/PBS suspension. Ciprofloxacin was used
as the reference drug, while 100% cell lysis was obtained using 1%
Triton X-100. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the microcentrifuge
tubes were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for
10 min. To obtain the absorbance at 450 nm, 150 μL of supernatant
fluid was transferred to a 96-well plate, and values were measured
using a Thermo Scientific MultiskanGo plate reader. The hemolysis
percentage was calculated by the following equation  

For human cell-based
studies, HEK-293
cells were procured from National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune,
India and maintained in DMEM media augmented with 10% heat-inactivated
FBS and 1% antibiotic cocktail solution in a 5% CO2incubator
at 37 °C. To observe the cytotoxicity of selected synthesized
compounds, MTT assay was used as per the published protocols.37 In short, the cells were plated at a density
of 9000–10,000 cells/well of a 96-well cell culture plate and
grown overnight. After 24 h, the cells were treated with increasing
concentration of each compound (0–400 μg/mL) for 48 h
at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The stock solutions of
each compound were made in DMSO, and the working solutions (1000μg/ml)
were made by diluting the stock in phosphate buffer saline (PBS),
pH 7.4. The mixture of compounds and culture medium were aspirated
after a stipulated time period, and cells were washed three times
with PBS (pH 7.4). Subsequently, from a 5 mg/mL stock solution of
MTT, 20 μL of MTT and 100 μL of cell culture medium were
added to each well, and cell plates were incubated for 4–5
h (37 °C in the CO2 incubator). After that, 4–5
h incubation, the supernatant was pipetted out, and the purple formazan
crystals were then dissolved by adding 150 μL of DMSO. The absorbance
was measured at 570 nm using multiplate ELISA reader (BioRad). The
% of cell viability was calculated and plotted as a function of concentration
of compound.

Disk Diffusion Assay
Based on antibacterial
potential
and hemolytic activity, we select compound 4l for further
exploration of their biological properties. We also determined the
antibacterial properties of 4l using disk diffusion assay.
The nutrient agar medium was autoclaved, allowed cooling up to approximately
45 °C, and poured into a sterilized Petri dish. On the basis
of susceptibility, Gram-negative E. coli ATCC 25922 and Gram-positive S. pneumoniae MTCC 655 were used as test organisms. After solidification, freshly
prepared inoculums of E. coli and S. pneumoniae were spread over agar plates, and 6
mm sterile disk of Whatman no. 1 filter paper was put at appropriate
distance for various concentrations of test compounds. DMSO (14 μL)
was used as a negative control, while one disk was left blank. Three
disks were impregnated by 2MIC, MIC, and 0.5 MIC of 4l followed by the incubation of agar plates at 37 °C for 24 h.
After incubation, the zone of inhibition was measured using HiAntibiotic
Zone Scale-c. The experiment was performed in triplicates at three
different times.

Spot Assay
Spot assay was performed
to check the killing
effect of compound 4l. Mid-log phase cells of Gram-negative E. coli ATCC 25922 and Gram-positive S. pneumoniae MTCC 655 were harvested and diluted
with sterile PBS to obtained cell suspension according to McFarland
standards. Suspension (2 mL) of each bacterial strain was exposed
to 2MIC, MIC, and 0.5MIC of test compound and further incubated at
37 °C and 160 rpm for 6 h. In the meantime, nutrient agar plates
were prepared as mentioned previously. After incubation of 6 h, a
spot (2 μL) from each sample was put at equidistance on the
nutrient agar plate. The plates were again incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. The growth of bacterial cells was observed after an incubation
period. The experiment was performed in triplicate in three different
times.

Growth Curve Studies
Growth curve study was performed
against E. coli (Gram-negative) and S. pneumoniae (Gram-positive) bacterial strains.
Concentrations, equivalent to 2MIC, MIC, and 0.5MIC, of compound 4l were dispensed into the separate conical flasks containing
50 mL of freshly prepared sterile nutrient broth medium. The medium
was inoculated with approximately 5 × 106 cells/mL
obtained from the log phase of E. coli and S. pneumoniae and incubated at
37 °C and 160 rpm. Aliquot (1 mL) from each sample was removed
at a regular time interval (i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18,
20, 22, and 24 h), and growth was measured turbidometrically at 580
nm using a Thermo Multiskan spectrophotometer. A graph was plotted
between time duration (in h) and O.D. to determine the effect of compound 4l on the growth cycle of test organisms.38

Time–Kill Curve Assay
Time–kill
curve
assay was performed to determine the bactericidal or bacteriostatic
nature of the lead inhibitor 4l against Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. pneumoniae strains. The freshly prepared sterile nutrient broth medium was
inoculated by fresh culture (approximately 2 × 106 cells) of test organisms in different conical flasks. The cells
were further two-fold diluted and exposed to the test compounds at
the concentrations corresponding to its 2MIC and MIC values, separately.
Untreated cells were used as a negative control. All the conical flasks
were incubated at 37 °C and 160 rpm. At predetermined time points
(0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h after incubation with agitation at 37 °C),
a 100 μL aliquot was removed from each solution and properly
diluted in sterile saline water. A 50 μL aliquot from each dilution
was spread over the nutrient agar plate. Then, the colony counts were
determined after incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. All the time–kill
curve experiments were conducted in duplicate, and mean colony count
data (log10 CFU/mL) were plotted as a function of time
for each strain.39

Synergistic
Assay
The fractional inhibitory concentration
index (FICI) or synergistic activity of compound 4l with
antibacterial drug ciprofloxacin was determined by the previously
reported microdilution checkerboard method in 96-well plates.40 Briefly, compound 4l was serially
diluted from 250 to 0.122 μg/mL conc. horizontally, while CIP
was diluted from 2 to 0.016 μg/mL conc. vertically in a sterile
nutrient broth medium. The plates were inoculated with approximately
2 × 106 cells of freshly prepared P.
aeruginosa, S. typhimurium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, and E. coli strains. The plates
were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The concentrations at which
no visible growth appeared were determined as the MIC values of compound 4l and CIP in combination. The FICI was calculated using the
following formula  

Synergy and antagonism were defined
by FIC indices of <0.5 and >4, respectively. An FIC index result
of >0.5 but <4 was considered indifferent.

Confocal
Laser Microscopy
Confocal laser microscopy
was performed to determine the bacterial cell lysis caused by lead
inhibitor 4l. The log-phase bacterial cells of E. coli were harvested by centrifugation at 3000
rpm for 15 min and washed twice with phosphate buffer saline. The
cell suspension was adjusted according to McFarland standards, and
then cells were exposed to MIC of 4l for 3 h at 37 °C.
After exposure to test compound, the cells were again washed with
PBS and counterstained with DAPI for 30 min in the dark. The cells
were further washed to remove extra dye using PBS buffer solution.
The slides for treated and untreated samples were prepared, fixed
using poly(l-lysine), and observed under a confocal laser
scanning microscope Leica DMRE equipped with a confocal head TCS SPE
(Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and a 60× water immersion objective
with a laser of 532 nm wavelength.

Biofilm Assessment by XTT
Assay
Biofilm formation in E. coli and S. pneumoniae was determined
by the semiquantitative method using XTT (2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)
carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium-hydroxide) reduction assay with slight modification
in the previously known method.29 Briefly,
aliquots of 100 μL of standardized cell suspension of S. pneumoniae and E. coli prepared in a sterile nutrient broth medium containing 0.5% additional
glucose and poured into the wells of the microtiter plate. The plate
was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in static conditions to establish
the biofilm. After an incubation period, the medium was discarded
and gently washed two times with PBS to remove nonadherent cells.
Further, 100 μL of freshly prepared medium containing 4MIC,
2MIC, and MIC of compound 4l was added to the wells.
The plate was again incubated at 37 °C for 24 h under static
conditions to determine the metabolic activity of the biofilm. The
medium was discarded and washed with PBS to remove the nonadherent
cells followed by the addition of 100 μL of prepared XTT salt
solution (HiMedia, India). The plate was incubated at 37 °C in
dark for 90 min. The bacterial dehydrogenase activity reduces XTT
tetrazolium salt to XTT formazan, resulting in a colorimetric change
(turns to orange) that was correlated with cell viability. The colorimetric
changes were measured spectrophotometrically at 490 nm. The % inhibition
data were interpreted from dose–response curves.

Biofilm
Formation Assessment by SEM
Biofilm inhibition
property of compound 4l was also determined by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) in E. coli. Sterile nutrient broth (3 mL) containing 0.5% additional glucose
was poured into the six-well plate (Tarson) and incubated with freshly
prepared primary culture of E. coli. Glass pieces (10 mm2) were sterilized and dispensed
into the medium for biofilm formation on the surface. The plate was
incubated at 37 °C for 6 h followed by addition of test compound.
The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for the next 24 h. After
incubation, the glass pieces were removed and gently washed with PBS
and kept in fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde
(PF) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) overnight. Samples were again
washed with PBS and dried to examine under a scanning electron microscope.

Docking Studies
The interaction between ligand and
targeted protein was determined by molecular docking using the computational
method. Docking studies were performed with methionine aminopeptidases
of E. coli (PDB ID: 1c21) and S. pneumoniae (PDB ID: 4km3). The 3D coordinates of both proteins
retrieved from RCSB protein data bank (www.rcsb.org/pdb) in PDB format.
The heteroatoms and water molecules were removed from the crystal
structure of MetAPs, which followed by energy minimization using a
Swiss PDB Viewer tool. The structure of compound 4l was
drawn using ChemDraw, and its 3D coordinate was generated using online
SMILES translator. The energy minimization of ligand was done using
a Swiss PDB Viewer tool. The desired format (PDBQT) for docking was
obtained using an ADT tool. Autodock Vina 4.2 software was used for
the docking process.41 Grid dimensions
of X, Y, and Z covering
completely EcMetAP protein molecule were 44, 46,
and 46, respectively, with 1 Å spacing, and those covering the SpMetAP protein molecule were 46, 50, and 42, respectively
with 1 Å spacing. Dimensions of the center grid box were 14.24,
−13.11, and
11.173 in the case of whole EcMetAP and 14.08, −55.61,
and 5.29 for SpMetAP molecule blind docking. Complex
with the minimum binding energy and involving interactions with important
residues of binding pocket was chosen as the basis for further interface
analysis. The visualization of docked outfile and interacted residues
was done in PyMOL.42
