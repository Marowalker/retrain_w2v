In
this study, a simple solution-mixing method is used to develop
a kind of excellent flexible, electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs).
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon blacks (CBs) as cofillers were
added into Ag-based pastes. The use of the two fillers is due to the
consideration that these two materials may provide positive synergistic
effects for improving the conductivity of ECAs. The conductivity,
flexibility, cyclability, and oxidation resistance of ECAs with different
contents of carbon fillers were studied. It was found that a small
amount of CNTs or CBs can dramatically improve the ECAs’ conductivity.
Solution-mixing method brings excellent carbon nanofiller dispersion
in polymer matrix. Highly dispersed CNTs and CBs among the Ag flakes
formed three-dimensional conducting networks to improve the conductivity
of ECAs. The conductivity of ternary hybrid ECAs (with addition of
3 wt % CNTs and 2 wt % CBs) with a low content of 55 wt % Ag flakes
is higher than that of the ECAs filled with only the Ag content over
65 wt %. Meanwhile, by selecting thermoplastic polyurethane resin
as the matrix, the ECAs exhibited excellent mechanical compliance.
The resistivity did not change when the ECAs were bended at a 60%
flexural strain or pressed under 1200 kPa. Additionally, the adhesion
strength of the new composited ECAs is better than that of a commercial
ECA (Abletherm 3188). Further, no obvious conductivity change was
observed when the sample was stored in ambient air condition at 80
°C and 60% relative humidity (60%) for 15 days.

Introduction
Ever evolving advances
in electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs)
have encouraged many developments in microelectronics.1 ECAs were regarded as one kind of most promising substitutions
to replace traditional joining materials such as Tin–lead (Sn–Pb)
solders in applications for printed circuits, coupled resonators,
thin-film devices, and flexible electronics.2−5 Compared with traditional Tin–lead
(Sn–Pb) solders, ECAs have many advantages such as more environmental
friendly, easy processing, lower processing temperatures, and allowing
higher resolution for fine-pitch interconnection capability.6−8 Although ECAs have many advantages, there are still many challenges
in achieving the replacement of traditional solders and fulfillment
of rigid requirements for interconnecting materials. The use of significant
amount of metal fillers for the current ECAs limits their widespread
applications in the field of flexible electronics.9−11 It is highly
advantageous and challenging to reduce the cost of metal fillers while
maintaining excellent electrical conductivity.

Reducing high
cost of metal fillers is closely associated with
a few approaches including engineering filler surfaces,12,13 adding additional conductive agents,14−16 or sintering nanofiller.17−19 Adding additional conductive agents into the ECAs is the most popular
method to enhance their conductivity. On the other hand, many efforts
have been to expand the possibilities of using carbon nanomaterials
in electronics due to their benefits of low weight, high mechanical
performance, high electrically conductivity, and low cost.20,21 Because of their unique electrical, chemical, and mechanical properties,
of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered as a kind of most promising
material for electronics. CNTs, as kind of one-dimensional (1D) conductive
materials, possess a high aspect ratio, which greatly decreases the
electrical percolation thresholds in polymer matrix.22−24 In addition, CNTs have low manufacturing price, which would make
them ideal additional conductive agents to connect Ag flakes in ECAs
through building a conductive networks for reducing the cost of ECAs.25

Although CNTs are excellent additional
materials, it is difficult
for one kind of material to fulfill the requirements for various applications.
To achieve low cost and high conductivity, more than one type of filler
with different dimensions is necessary to prepare ECAs. These materials
include zero-dimensional atomic particles (e.g., nanocarbon black
(nano-CBs) and silica), 1D rod-like nanofillers (e.g., carbon nanotubes
and silver nanowires (NWs)), and two-dimensional (2D) layered nanofillers
(e.g., clay platelets, and graphene).26−30 In fact, because of their differences in shapes and
element components, each kind of nanomaterial has its own unique ability.
Positive synergistic effects of these nanoparticles on improving the
electrical and other properties of polymer matrix are expected.

Therefore, some researchers turned to prepare three-dimensional
(3D) hierarchical conductive networks with the hybrid of two or three
conductive agents of different shapes and sizes.31−33 Tang et al.31 reported a simple method to build a 3D foam-like
conductive network structure by using CNTs and graphene sheets as
the 1D and 2D nanoconstituents and latex-polystyrene microspheres
as cofillers. The introduction of a second conductive filler of graphene
significantly changed the conductive network morphology of conductive
polymer composites filled with CNTs. Luo et al.32 fabricated a kind of adhesives with CNTs and Ag flakes.
Their results showed that CNTs used there as conductivity fillers
could bridge the neighboring silver flakes to accelerate the electron
transportation. Fu et al.33 also studied
the ECAs based on the ternary hybrid of Ag microflakes, Ag nanospheres
(Ag-NSs), and Ag nanowires (Ag-NWs) and demonstrated that a small
amount of Ag-NSs or Ag-NWs could dramatically improve the conductivity
of the ECAs filled with single Ag-microflakes (MFs). The Ag-NSs
and Ag-NWs with appropriate contents have a synergistic effect in
improving the conductivity of the ECAs.

In this research, we
focused on combining the merits of the properties
of CNTs and the extremely low cost of activated carbon black (CBs).
The goal of this research is to achieve high conductivity of ECAs
by adding a small amount of carbon nanomaterials with difference dimensions.
We used activated CNTs and CBs as additional conductive nanofillers
for electrically conductive adhesives. Generally, typical ECAs contain
polymer matrices and conductive fillers. To reduce the use of metal
contents, some of the studies have reported the use of various nanomaterials
included a small amount of metal nanoparticles/nanowire, nanowires,
or carbon nanomaterials, and even conductive nanopolymers34−36 as additional conductive agents. However, adopting CNTs and CBs
as cofillers to achieve low cost and high conductivity due to their
unique positive synergistic effects has still not been reported.

For the prevention of their agglomeration, the CNTs used herein
were functionalized with carboxylic groups by an acid treatment process
and were called active CNTs. Small amount of activated CNTs and CBs
were dispersed in the thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as flexible
conductive adhesives. These different nanostructured carbon materials
were introduced to significantly change the conductive network morphologies
of ECAs filled with Ag flakes. The electrical properties of ECAs with
hierarchical structures were better than those of ECAs with CBs or
CNTs alone. The enhanced properties can be attributed to the synergy
between CBs, CNTs, and Ag flakes in forming a 3D conducting networks
with high quality.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of ECAs
The detailed preparation of the
ECAs is described in detail in the Experimental Section. Briefly, acid-treated CNTs (Figure S1) prepared according to known literature37 and carbon blacks were mixed homogeneously in 1,4-dioxane. Polyurethanes
(Figure S2) particles (TPU resin) were
added to the mixture. And then, Ag flakes were put into the mixture.
The obtained mixture was dried under vacuum to form the ECAs. Detailed
compositions for the ECAs are given in Table 1.

Characterizations
of Acid-Treated CNTs
Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra of CNTs before and after acid treatment are
presented in Figure 1a. The peaks appearing at around 3436, 1720, and 1213 cm–1 were assigned to −OH, COO, and C–C–O stretching
present in carboxylic groups (−COOH), respectively.38 Meanwhile, the intensities of peaks around 3436
and 1720 cm–1 considerably increased after acid
treatment. The acid-treated CNTs were further investigated by Raman
spectra and transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Figure S3). A detailed description of the Raman spectrum characteristics
is given in Figure S3. These characterizations
demonstrated the successful oxidation of CNTs for the generation of
acid-functionalized CNTs.

Figure 1 (a) FT-IR spectra of raw and oxidized CNTs and
(b) dispersion test
of CNTs in 1,4-dioxane (5 mg CNTs/20 mL 1,4-dioxane).

The pictures of the dispersion of pristine CNTs
and acid-treated
CNTs at a concentration of 25 mg mL–1 are shown
in Figure 1b. The pristine
CNTs could not be well-dispersed in 1,4-dioxane at a concentration
of 25 mg mL–1 after 24 h of bath sonication. These
pristine CNTs precipitated after sonication. However, the acid-treated
CNTs were homogeneously dispersed in 1,4-dioxane after sonication
under similar conditions as those for pristine CNTs, and the dispersion
is stable even after standing for 24 h without visible agglomerations.
In contrast, CBs can be dispersed easily in 1,4-dioxane by facile
sonication method. After sonication, no visible particles were recognized
in CBs 1,4-dioxane suspension (Figure S4).

Bulk Resistivity and Conduction Mechanism
The bulk
resistivity of a series of ternary hybrids is shown in Figure 2a, and the obtained resistivity
could be as low as 32.84 × 10– 5 Ω
cm at 55 wt % silver loading after curing at 180 °C and cooling
to room temperature for measurement. The resistivity of TPU–ECAs
(2 wt % CB, 3 wt % CNTs, and 55 wt % Ag flakes) is one-tenth that
of TPU–ECAs with 55 wt % Ag flakes only, which is even less
than that of TPU–ECAs filled with 65% Ag flakes only. These
results showed significant contribution of the addition of CNTs and
CBs into the traditional Ag flakes-based ECAs in improving their conductivity.

In the case of ternary hybrid adhesives, high electrical
conductivity
was obtained by simply adding carbon materials instead of using a
lot of expensive Ag flakes. Two main key factors can contribute to
the high conductivity of the ternary hybrid adhesives. One factor
is that more than one type of conductive fillers with different dimensions
have positive synergistic effects on improving the conductivity of
ternary hybrid adhesives. The introduction of second and third conductive
fillers can significantly change the conductive network morphologies
of the adhesives. Thus, carbon-fillers are used to construct 3D continuous
conductive networks with high-quality interconnections in the polymer
matrix. Figure 2b shows
that electrical properties of the adhesives with such 3D hierarchical
structures are much better than those of binary adhesive with CBs
or CNTs alone. The enhanced properties are attributed to the synergy
effect of CBs and CNTs in forming 3D conducting networks with appropriate
CBs/CNTs ratios. In Figure 2b, ternary hybrid adhesives (55% Ag flakes) with 2 wt % CB
and 3 wt % CNTs have the lowest bulk resistivity among various compositions
we studied.

Another factor is the choice of solution-mixing
method for adhesive
preparation. In conductive adhesives, charge carriers are transported
along the interconnected conductive fillers embedded in the polymer
matrix. Thus, the construction of highly dispersed conductive network
plays a crucial role in the fabrication of conductive adhesives with
superior electrical properties. Compared to the results obtained from
melt blending, which only realizes the macroscopic dispersion of fillers
due to high viscosities of the composites,39 solution-mixing method we used here can be considered to obtain
better fillers dispersion in a diluted solution. This solution-mixing
process comprises three main steps: (1) dispersing nanofillers in
a suitable suspension solvent; (2) mixing the resulting suspension
with the polymer; and (3) forming target adhesives after solvent evaporation.
We dispersed carbon nanofillers in 1,4-dioxane for a suspension and
mixed the resultant suspension with TPU pellets by mechanical stirring
and high-power ultrasonication to promote filler dispersion. This
leads to form 3D continuous interconnected fillers distribution in
the polymer matrix.

It is important to note that ternary hybrid
adhesives (TH-ECAs)
exhibit high electrical conductivity even when prepared at low curing
temperature. Figure 2c shows that ternary hybrid adhesives, which was prepared by curing
at 120 °C, with 55 wt % Ag flakes (named as C-4, Table 1) had a bulk resistivity of
58.16 × 10–5 Ω cm. For comparison, the
bulk resistivity of PU–ECA with Ag flakes (65 wt %) only is
about 8-fold of that of C-4 when prepared at the same curing temperature
of 120 °C. It was found that even a trace amount of carbon materials
could reduce the resistivity significantly. Although using higher
curing temperature could also bring about lower electrical resistivity
(from 473 × 10–5 to 28.6 ×10–5 Ω cm for the 65 wt % Ag-based ECAs) when curing temperature
was increased from 120 to 200 °C without the addition of carbon
materials, higher curing temperature is harsh for temperature-sensitive
devices with high cost for processing the adhesives. The scanning
electron microscope (SEM) images gave the morphologies of the dispersion
of silver flakes and hybrid carbon materials in C-4 TH-ECAs (Figure S5). The results showed that hybrid carbon
materials have obvious aggregations in the TPU resin matrix. Carbon
materials dispersed well to bridge the neighboring silver flakes and
build 3D hierarchical structures for TH-ECAs.

Conductivity under Mechanical
Deformation
Recently,
flexible electronics have attracted scientists’ attention significantly.
For application in flexible devices, the ECAs are required to keep
their conductivity under mechanical deformation. Figure 3 shows the resistivity change
of TH-ECAs films under flexural forms of mechanical deformation. The
bending deformation of a free-standing TH-ECAs film was tested using
a custom-made stretching machine. The testing approach with a bending
angle of a custom-made stretching machine is illustrated in Figure 3a. Figure 3b gives the TH-ECAs’
resistance change as a function of flexural strain. Only very small
resistance changes (within 10%) were observed even after bending at
a flexural strain up to 60%. Moreover, the normalized resistance change
is less than 20% even after 500 cycles of bending (Figure 3c).

of bending test of PU–ECAs. (b)
Bulk resistivity of PU–ECAs as a functional of flexural strain.
(c) Electrical resistance variation of PU–ECAs with different
degrees of mechanical bending.

Besides the above properties, the resistivity of the TH-ECAs
was
also stable under pressure. There is only less than 15% resistivity
change after the film was pressured under 1200 kPa (∼12 atmosphere
pressure) (Figure 4b), showing excellent electrical properties under deformation.

Figure 4 (a) Schematic
of the high-pressure test of TH-ECAs. (b) Bulk resistivity
before and after high-pressure test.

Conductivity upon Continuous Thermal Treatment
We performed
2 weeks aging experiments at 80 °C with relative humidity of
60% (60% rh) to test the time-dependent resistivity changes (Figure 5a). The results were
obtained by averaging 12 measurements from different areas of each
tested sample. For TH-ECAs annealed at 80 °C, the bulk resistivity
maintains basic stability, showing good thermal stability of the ECAs.
In contrast, the resistivity of conventional PU–ECAs with 55
wt % Ag content only while without the carbon fillers increased
by 40%.

fillers in aging experiment at 85 °C under 60% rh. (b) Contact
angles on TH-ECAs. (c) Contact angles on PU–ECAs containing
55 wt % silver fillers.

For understanding the possible reason for this performance,
we
studied the surface properties of the ECAs. The surface wettability
is shown in Figure 5b. The contact angle between distilled water and TH-ECAs (C-4) substrate
was 107.2° (Figure 5b). However, the contact angle between distilled water and the common
TPU–ECAs substrate (with 55 wt % Ag) without the addition of
fillers of CNTs and CBs was only 79.90° (Figure 5c). This change might be attributed to the
addition of hydrophobic fillers. This comparison demonstrates that
TH-ECAs have excellent moisture resistance, which might be favorable
to increase the oxidation resistance to result in good thermal stability.

Adhesion Strength
The adhesion properties of ECAs on
aluminum surface were investigated by a lap shear test elaborated
in Figure 6a. The adhesion
properties of TH-ECAs (C-4), pure TPU, and PU-based ECA without the
addition of carbon materials were assessed. It was found that the
adhesion strength of TH-ECAs (C-4) was 0.10 kg mm–2, which is lower than that of pure PU resin (0.16 kg mm–2, Figure 6b). This
indicated that a high inorganic filler content will lead to a low
adhesive property. However, this value is still higher than that of
a commercially available PU-based ECA (Abletherm 3188 with 0.06 kg
mm–2) without the carbon material. This might be
because the obtained ternary Ag–TPU adhesive with a low Ag
content of 55 wt % is superior to those with a much higher Ag-MF content
of over 65 wt %.

test results of TH-ECAs, pure PU, and commercial ECA (Abletherm 3188).

Demonstration of Applications
of C-4 ECAs
Light-emitting-diode
(LED) chips were attached to TH-ECAs on a paper substrate as a demonstration
of the new type adhesive application. The brightness of these LED
chips was constant for not only a flat device (Figure 7a) but also on a device under high flexural
state (Figure 7b),
indicating excellent conductivity of the ECA circuits under mechanical
deformation. This might provide a potential alternative for flexible
and printed electronics.

does not change when flexible circuits are bent.

Comparison of Conductivities of This Work and Few Recent Works
Table 2 gives a
comparison of the conductivities of the above-studied ECAs and those
given in some other works. It was found that our TH-ECA (C-4), which
contains only 55 wt % silver filler, has a very low electrical resistivity
of 32.84 × 10–5 Ω cm. By comparing our
results to those of other works reported in Table 2, we concluded that high conductivity of
conductive adhesives with lower silver content can be achieved by
our approach. These properties may be beneficial for the goal of increasing
electrical conductivity while reducing the use of expensive metal
fillers.

Conclusions
In this study, new TPU–ECAs
have been prepared. These TPU–ECAs
offered high electrical conductivity by adding activated CNTs and
CBs as additional conductive agents. Highly dispersed CNTs and CBs
provide positive synergistic effects to reduce the resistivity of
the TPU–ECAs. The electrical resistivity reached as low as
32.84 × 10–5 Ω cm using only 55 wt %
silver loading and remained quite stable at flexural strain or under
high pressure (1200 kPa). By grafting a small amount of hydrophobic
CNTs, good thermal stability was achieved. The adhesives also exhibited
excellent adhesion due to the use of relatively small amount of silver
contents. The combination of these advantages are expected to enable
the TPU–ECAs to have a very bright future as flexible and printed
electronics.

Experimental Section
Materials
Nonfunctionalized
multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(CM-95) were obtained from Hanwha Nanotech (Beijing, China). Conductive
carbon black (Printex XE2B) was purchased from Evonik Degussa GmbH
(Germany). 1,4-Dioxane and thermoplastic polyurethane (TUP) were obtained
from Adamas Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Ag flakes with average
diameters of 8–10 mm were purchased from Bolong Silver Industry
(Changsha, China).

Preparation of Acid-Functionalized CNTs
The CNTs were
acid-treated with H2SO4 and HNO3.
CNTs, 0.2 g, were treated with 75 mL of H2SO4 and 25 mL of HNO3 to generate functional groups on the
surfaces of the CNTs. After 12 h sonication process in the acid, acid-functionalized
CNTs (named O-CNT) were centrifuged and washed for neutralization.

Preparation of ECAs
First, acid-treated CNTs and carbon
blacks were mixed homogeneously in 1,4-dioxane. Second, TPU particles
(the structure of polyurethane is given in Figure S2) were added to the mixture. Then, Ag flakes were put into
the mixture under stirring at 600 rpm for 3 h. The obtained mixture
was dried under vacuum (about 20 Pa) for 24 h to remove the solvent.
Detailed compositions for the ECAs are given in Table 1. The TUP/carbon nanocomposite ECAs films
were prepared via the solvent-evaporation method (Figure S1).

Characterization and Measurements
The morphologies
of carbon fillers, Ag flakes, and ECAs were observed using a scanning
electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4300, Japan). Transmission electron
microscope (TEM) was operated at 200 kV using a JEOL-2100F microscope
(Tokyo, Japan). For the observation of CNTs only, the sample for TEM
was prepared by dispersing carbon materials in 1,4-dioxane by ultrasonication.

The samples for volume resistivity measurements were prepared according
to a four-point probe system (RTS-9, 4 PROBES TECH, Guangzhou, China).
First, two parallel strips of 3 meters of tape were placed 2.54 mm
apart along the length of a standard glass slide of 25.4 mm ×
76.2 mm. Second, a small amount of ECA was added in the space between
the 3 meter tape. Then, a scalpel was used manually to squeeze the
ECAs into the space between the two 3 meter tapes. After the samples
were heated at various temperatures for 2 h, the volume resistance
of the ECAs was measured by a four-point probe and the volume resistivity
(ρ) was calculated from eq 1. 1  where R is the sheet resistivity
of the sample and A is the thickness of the sample.

The samples for adhesion test were prepared according to Liu’s
previous work.43 Briefly, an aluminum sheet
with a dimension of 100 mm × 25 mm × 2 mm was polished to
prepare the adhesion test. Afterward, two rectangular aluminum alloy
sheets with an overlap length of 10 mm were fixed with the as-prepared
adhesives. Then, the samples were heated at 180 °C for 2 h. Measurement
of the adhesion of the ECAs was conducted by an electronic tensile
testing machine (Instron 2367, Norwood). The adhesion can be calculated
from eq 2. 2  where W and L are the length and the width of the bonding parts of the
sample
and F is the force applied to break the bond.

The bending of the adhesive sample was carried out using a custom-made
stretching machine, which is illustrated in the Supporting Information
(Figure S6). The flexural strain can be
calculated from eq 3. 3
