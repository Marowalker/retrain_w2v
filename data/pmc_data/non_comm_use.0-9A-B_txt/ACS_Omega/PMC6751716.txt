Biodegradable Mg alloys have good
bioactivity and suitable mechanical
properties, which is desirable for application in the clinical fields.
However, the biocompatibility of Mg alloys during the degradation
process has always been a concern. In this paper, the corrosion behavior
of AZ91 alloys in a simulated cell culture environment was studied,
especially the insoluble corrosion product during the degradation
was characterized, and the biocompatibility of the insoluble corrosion
products was evaluated. The results of immersion test showed that
the corrosion rate of the AZ91 alloy was low under the condition of
high CO2 and humidity, especially in phosphate-buffered
saline. Moreover, the insoluble corrosion product was MgCO3·3H2O, which showed a needle-like, circular aggregated,
and square-radial feature. Meanwhile, MgCO3·3H2O showed poor cell biocompatibility by increasing the pH and
Mg2+ content of the culture solution, which may affect
the biocompatibility of Mg alloys.

1 Introduction
In recent years, Mg alloys
have been widely studied about their
application as bone implants due to their excellent properties such
as suitable elastic modulus and bioactivity.1−4 Meanwhile, their potential application
as a cardiovascular stent has also been conducted.5−9 However, Mg alloys have a high corrosion rate in
aqueous environments, so the alloying, mechanical treatment, and surface
treatment methods are necessary to enhance their corrosion resistance.10−13 A very fast degradation rate will induce some biocompatibility problems,
although it could lead to an alkaline environment, which is the main
reason of the antibacterial properties of Mg alloys.14 Fei et al.15 revealed that Mg-2Nd-Zn
(NZ20) alloys have adverse effects on neurons, endothelial cells,
and osteoblast due to the high pH and Mg2+ content of the
NZ20 extract. In addition, Riaz et al.16 found that the degradation of AZ31 in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) could increase the viscosity of the immersion solution, which
may cause some blood complications due to its gelatinization of blood.

There are many studies about the bad effect of the high pH and
Mg2+ content on the biocompatibility of Mg alloys. However,
few studies are related to the effect of insoluble corrosion products
produced during the degradation process of Mg alloys on the biocompatibility
of Mg alloys.17 Therefore, it is necessary
to study and understand the functions of insoluble corrosion products.
The systemic study on insoluble corrosion products is generally limited
to in vitro corrosion of Mg alloys.18,19 For instance,
Cai et al.20 revealed that Mg(OH)2 and CaHPO4·2H2O films were formed successively
in the corrosion process of Mg-Zn-Zr-xNd alloys.
Li et al.21 discovered that the MgF2 coating was replaced by the Mg(OH)2 film during
the degradation of fluoride-treated AZ31B alloys. Qu et al.22 found that the corrosion rate of AZ31B immersed
in NaCl solutions saturated with CO2 was reduced, because
CO2 can decrease the corrosion rate of the Mg alloy by
promoting the formation of an insoluble product (Mg2(OH)2CO3). Hence, it is clear that the insoluble corrosion
products play an important role in the degradation of the Mg alloy,
and the composition of insoluble corrosion products of Mg alloys is
different under different corrosion conditions. However, there is
still no study focused on the properties of the insoluble corrosion
products produced during the degradation process of Mg alloys under
a cell culture environment (37 °C, 5% CO2, and saturated
degree of humidity). The cell culture environment is more similar
to the internal environment of a living organism, which is beneficial
to better simulate the degradation of the Mg alloy in vivo.

In this work, the corrosion behavior of AZ91 Mg alloys in the simulated
cell culture environment was investigated, especially the insoluble
corrosion products formed in the experiment. The biocompatibility
of the insoluble corrosion products was also evaluated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 The Immersion Tests
2.1.1 pH Variation
The pH values of corrosion
solutions are shown in Figure 1. It can be found that the pH of the two immersion solutions
ranged from 6.0 to 9.0. As is well known, the degradation of magnesium
can make the surrounding environment alkaline, and the pH of the immersion
solution was more than 10 without surface treatment.23,24 The abnormality, decrease, and small vibration of pH on the 4th
day may have originated from the addition of CO2. Then,
the pH of the immersion solution increased slowly on the 7th day for
A group (the red line shown in Figure 1). It was reported that HPO42– and HCO3– can delay the corrosion of
fluoride-coated AZ31B.21 Hence, in this
experiment, it is possible that the degradation of the AZ91 alloy
is buffered by the immersion solution containing HPO42– and HCO3–. Then, the
pH value of the solution decreased suddenly on the 8th day owing to
the protection of corrosion products formed on the surface of Mg alloys.
Also, with the balance between the protective effect of corrosion
products and the corrosion effect of solutions on Mg alloys, the pH
increased slightly and finally leveled off. On the other hand, the
pH of the AZ91 alloy immersed in PBS increased in the first 3 days
because of the corrosion of Mg alloys. Meanwhile, the buffering effect
of PBS and the precipitation of degradation products inhibited the
increase in the pH value, but the corrosion rate of the Mg alloy did
not decrease owing to Cl–. Hence, after 3 days,
the pH value of the immersion solution slightly decreased, then increased,
and finally leveled off. Qu et al.22 revealed
that the pH of NaCl solution saturated with CO2 was 4;
therefore, PBS was acidic in the early stage, which may be due to
the dissolution of CO2. Compared with the pH value of the
culture medium, the change in pH value in PBS was relatively hysteretic,
which indicates that the buffering effect of PBS was stronger than
that of the culture medium for the AZ91 alloy.

solutions in the immersion test for 12 days.
The red line and the blue line represent the pH variation of the AZ91
alloy immersed in the culture medium (A group) and PBS (B group),
respectively.

2.1.2 The
Weight Loss of AZ91 Mg Alloys in the
Immersion Test
The weight loss of AZ91 Mg alloys is shown
in Figure 2a. The weight
losses of the AZ91 alloy were 6.167 and 4.267 mg in the culture medium
(A group) and PBS (B group) for 12 days, respectively. The results
revealed that the corrosion of AZ91 in the culture medium was more
serious than that in PBS. Thus, the corrosion rate of the magnesium
alloy can be calculated according to the following formula:25 1  where C is
the corrosion rate (mm/year), K is the conversion
coefficient (8.76 × 104), Δm is the weight loss in the immersion test (g), A is the exposed surface area (cm2), T is the immersion time (h), and D is the density
of the Mg alloy (1.80 g/cm3). According to formula 1, the corrosion rates of the
AZ91 alloy in the two groups were 0.592 and 0.413 mm/year, respectively,
as shown in Figure 2b. Obviously, the corrosion rate of AZ91 in the culture medium was
greater than that in PBS. Meanwhile, compared with Mg alloy samples
without the environment of CO2 incubator, the mass loss
of our samples was much smaller.23,26

Figure 2 (a) Weight
loss and (b) the relative calculated corrosion rate
of the AZ91 alloy in the immersion test. The weight losses of the
AZ91 alloy in the culture medium (A group) and PBS (B group) were
6.167 and 4.267 mg, respectively. The corrosion rates of the AZ91
alloy in the two groups were 0.592 and 0.413 mm/year, respectively.

2.1.3 The Morphologies of Mg
Alloys after the
Immersion Test
The surface morphology of the AZ91 alloy immersed
in the culture medium (A group) and PBS (B group) for 12 days is shown
in Figure 3. In Figure 3a, the obvious local
corrosion can be seen. Then, the corrosion of B group was slight in Figure 3c,d. Hence, it is clear that the corrosion
degree of the AZ91 Mg alloy immersed in the culture medium (A group)
was more serious than that in PBS (B group) (Figure 3a–d). The optical microscopy pictures
showed that Mg alloys of two groups corroded (the black part in Figure 3e–i). Moreover,
the pit corrosion can be found in Figure 3h,i (the black circular spots in the pictures).

Digital photos. (e–j) Optical microscopy pictures. Panels (a),
(b), (e), (f), and (g) are the corrosion morphology of AZ91 immersed
in the culture medium (A group), while panels (c), (d), (h), (i),
and (j) are the corrosion morphology of AZ91 immersed in PBS (B group).

The weight loss, corrosion rate, and morphology
of the AZ91 alloy
show that the corrosion effect of the culture medium on the AZ91 alloy
is greater than that on PBS. The buffer system that existed in the
two immersion solutions alleviates the erosion of Cl– on Mg by bonding with Mg2+.27 At the same time, the precipitates formed by the combination of
buffering substances and Mg2+ have a certain protective
effect on magnesium alloys.28 Even though
the difference of the buffer system could cause the difference of
the corrosion rate, the addition of CO2 to the immersion
environment may reduce this difference when the immersion test was
carried out in the CO2 incubator.29 Therefore, proteins may be the main reason for the difference for
the corrosion of AZ91 alloys in the culture medium and PBS. There
are some studies showing that proteins adhered to the surface of Mg
alloys and formed a protective layer to inhibit the corrosion of Mg
alloys in the short-term immersion.27,30 However, with
the extension of the immersion time and the diffusion and shedding
of the layer, the corrosion of Mg alloys would accelerate.31,32 Hence, the difference of the buffer system and proteins can affect
the degradation of AZ91.

2.2 Characteristics
of the Insoluble Corrosion
Products
2.2.1 The Formation of the Insoluble Corrosion
Products in the Immersion Test
Optical microscopy images
of the insoluble corrosion products in the immersion test are shown
in Figure 4. The insoluble
corrosion products had three shapes: the needle-like products, the
circular aggregates, and the square-radial products. The needle-like
products could be formed when the AZ91 alloy was immersed for 4 days
(Figure 4b,f). Moreover,
a large number of the needle-like products were formed from the AZ91
alloy immersed in both the culture medium (A group) and PBS (B group).
The length of the needle-like products in the immersion solution was
different, as shown in Figure 4b,f. Next, a large number of circular aggregates of the needle-like
products in the immersion solutions can be observed in Figure 4c,h. The abundant square-radial
products appeared after the AZ91 alloy was immersed in the culture
medium for 10 days (Figure 4d). However, the square-radial products were not found in
PBS, while the circular aggregate of the needle-like products appeared
in abundance (Figure 4h).

Figure 4 Optical microscopy images of the insoluble corrosion products in
the immersion test. (a–d) Microscopy pictures of the insoluble
corrosion products of AZ91 immersed in the culture medium (A group)
for 1, 4, 7, and 10 days, respectively. (e–h) Microscopy pictures
of insoluble corrosion products of AZ91 immersed in PBS (B group)
for 1, 4, 7, and 10 days, respectively. The insoluble corrosion products
with three different forms are denoted by boxes. The red boxes represent
the needle-like products, the yellow boxes are the circular aggregates,
and the green box shows the square-radial products.

The size distribution of needle-like insoluble corrosion
products
after 4 and 7 days of immersion is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a,c shows the size distribution of the insoluble corrosion
products in the culture medium (A group) and PBS (B group) after 4
days immersion, respectively. The results showed that the size of
products in the culture medium was between 8.199 and 31.689 μm,
and that in PBS was between 11.168and 55.543 μm (detailed data
is shown in Table 1). The size of most products in the culture medium was in the range
of 15–25 μm, and that in PBS was in the range of 20–40
μm. Figure 5b,d
is the size distribution diagram of insoluble corrosion products in
the culture medium and PBS after 7 days immersion, respectively. It
was found that the size of products in the culture medium and PBS
ranged from 13.527 to 36.785 μm and 9.852 to 67.608 μm,
respectively. Most products in the culture medium were between 20
and 30 μm in size, and those in PBS were between 15 and 45 μm.
The mean size of needle-like insoluble corrosion products is shown
in Table 1. It is found
that the size of needle-like insoluble corrosion products in the culture
medium was smaller than that in PBS. Needle-like insoluble corrosion
products in PBS had a large difference in size. Meanwhile, according
to the size statistical results of insoluble corrosion products in
size after 4 and 7 days of immersion, the overall size of products
changed slightly.

4 and 7 days of immersion. (a, b) Size distribution of needle-like
insoluble corrosion products of AZ91 immersed in the culture medium
(A group) for 4 and 7 days, respectively. (c, d) Size distribution

B	4	29.546	11.168	55.543

The insoluble corrosion products
were rich and at the bottom of
the Petri dish, which may hinder the cell attachment in cell experiments.
At the same time, those products were free and diverse in shape: needle-like,
aggregate, and radial. Thus, the size of the insoluble corrosion products
was different, but it was in the scale of micrometers. These characteristics
of the insoluble corrosion products may lead to the blockages in blood
vessels and may be detrimental to tissue repair.

2.2.2 XRD Patterns of the Immersion Products
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the immersion products are
shown in Figure 6. Figure 6a,b shows the XRD
patterns of the immersion products of AZ91 immersed in the culture
medium and PBS, respectively. The main components of immersion products
were NaCl and MgCO3·3H2O. Among them, NaCl
was the component of the immersion solution. Hence, the insoluble
corrosion product was MgCO3·3H2O.33,34

patterns of the immersion products of the AZ91 alloy immersed
in (a) the culture medium and (b) PBS.

2.2.3 SEM of the Immersion Products
The
immersion products of the AZ91 alloy immersed in the culture medium
and PBS are shown in Figure 7a,b. In Figure 7a, the immersion products consisted mainly of the large and irregular
product, while relatively small and regular rods were seen in Figure 7b. There was no needle-like
product in the immersion products, which is formerly observed in Figure 4. The small and regular
rod-like products observed could be MgCO3·3H2O, which were in various forms, such as needle, rod, and radial,
under different environments.35−37 Therefore, there was only the
square product in SEM images owing to the change in pH or temperature
during the drying of immersion products.37

Figure 7 SEM
images of the immersion products. The immersion products of
the AZ91 alloy immersed in (a) the culture medium and (b) PBS, respectively.

As is well known, during the corrosion of the AZ91
alloy, the following
reactions take place: 2   3  

The dissolution of CO2 and the existence of HCO3– can buffer
the alkaline environment because
the ionization reaction of HCO3– is greater
than the hydrolysis under alkaline conditions. The reaction equation
is as follows: 4   5  

Then, the formation equation of MgCO3·3H2O is deduced as the following:38,39 6  

Under an environment of 37 °C, 5% CO2, and
saturated
degree of humidity, the insoluble corrosion product of AZ91 is MgCO3·3H2O. However, there are many other ions
in the blood, such as Ca2+, which may affect the composition
of the insoluble corrosion products of Mg alloys. Therefore, it is
necessary to further study the insoluble corrosion products of Mg
alloys under the physiological environment.

2.3 Biocompatibility Evaluation of MgCO3·3H2O
2.3.1 The Morphology of MgCO3·3H2O
The morphological images of MgCO3·3H2O are shown in Figure 8. The results showed that MgCO3·3H2O had the square shape in Figure 8a,d. There was the needle-like MgCO3·3H2O in Figure 8b,c,e,f. It can be seen that the square MgCO3·3H2O can be converted into the needle-like product with the increase
in culture time. Accordingly, it is confirmed that the small and regular
rod-like products in Figure 7 were MgCO3·3H2O.

Images of the experimental group with 1.0 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O (D group) for 1, 3, and 5 days, respectively.

2.3.2 The pH Variation of Culture Solution in
the Biocompatibility Test of MgCO3·3H2O
The pH of the culture solution in the biocompatibility test of
MgCO3·3H2O is shown in Figure 9. It can be found that the
overall pH was between 5.5 and 7.0. Then, after 1 day of culture,
the pH among the three test groups was similar and close to 6.25.
For the next 4 days, the pH of the experimental group with 1.5 mg/mL
MgCO3·3H2O increased slowly and reached
7.0, the pH of the experimental group with 1.0 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O changed slightly, and the pH of the blank control
group slightly reduced to 5.5 due to the rapid proliferation of cells.
It is obvious that the pH of the culture solution increased with the
increase in MgCO3·3H2O content.

Figure 9 pH of the culture
solution in the biocompatibility test of MgCO3·3H2O (C, experimental group with 1.5 mg/mL
MgCO3·3H2O; D, experimental group with
1.0 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O; and E, blank control
group (0.0 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O)).

2.3.3 The Mg2+ Content in Culture Solution
The Mg2+ content of the culture solution in the biocompatibility
test of MgCO3·3H2O is shown in Figure 10. The results showed
that the difference of Mg2+ content in the culture solution
was large, and the maximum and minimum of Mg2+ content
were 599.778 and 73.111 μg/mL, respectively. During the biocompatibility
test, the Mg2+ content in the experimental group with 1.5
mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O (C group) first increased
and then decreased slowly, and that in the group with 1.0 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O (D group) varied greatly and showed
no trend. However, the daily mean values of Mg2+ content
in C group and D group were 420.333 and 290.000 μg/mL, respectively.
Hence, the Mg2+ content in C group was larger than that
in D group, even though their content was small.

Figure 10 Concentration of Mg2+ in the culture solution of the
biocompatibility test of MgCO3·3H2O (C,
experimental group with 1.5 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O; and D, experimental group with 1.0 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O).

2.3.4 The
Cell Number in Biocompatibility Test
The cell number of the
coculture test of MgCO3·3H2O and cells
for 1, 3, and 5 days is shown in Figure 11. The results of the biocompatibility
test showed that the blank control group (0.0 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O) had the fastest cell proliferation, followed
by the experimental group with 1.0 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O, and the experimental group containing 1.5 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O showed the slowest rate of cell proliferation.
It was found that the cell number of the group containing 1.5 mg/mL
MgCO3·3H2O increased slightly for 5 days.
Except the higher pH and Mg2+ content of the culture solution
(details are shown in Figures 9 and 10),
there was no room on the bottom of the Petri dish for the cell proliferation,
which was covered by MgCO3·3H2O, as shown
in Figure 8b,c). In Figure 11, it was found
that the cell number was not significantly different in the three
groups after 1 day of coculture test. Moreover, after 3 days of coculture
test, there was a slight difference in the cell number between the
two experimental groups, which was obviously different from the control
group. After 5 days of coculture test, the cell number between three
groups was evidently different.

Figure 11 Cell number in the coculture test for
1, 3, and 5 days (C, experimental
group with 1.5 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O; D, experimental
group with 1.0 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O; and E,
blank control group (0.0 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O)).

In addition, the cell viability
of the coculture test is listed
in Table 2. The results
showed that the relative cell activity of the two experimental groups
was greater than 50% only after 1 day of coculture test. The relative
cell activity in the two experimental groups was quite different after
1 and 5 days of coculture test (the difference was more than 20%),
while there was no significant difference after 3 days of coculture
test. The relative cell viability of the group with 1.0 mg/mL MgCO3·3H2O increased slightly after 5 days of coculture
test (from 22 to 26%). However, it is clear that the cell viability
roughly decreased with the increase in culture time and the concentration
of corrosion products. Hence, the inhibitory effect of MgCO3·3H2O on cells was more obvious with the increase
in content and culture time.

the Coculture Test

C	1.5	59	15	5

E	0.0	100	100	100	
In addition to increasing
the pH and Mg2+ content of
the culture solution and occupying the growth space of cells, the
needle-like shape may be one of the reasons for the poor biocompatibility
of MgCO3·3H2O. Figure 12 shows the phagocytosis of pig iliac endothelial
cells (PIEC) to needle-like MgCO3·3H2O.
To the best of our knowledge, macrophages can phagocytize the degradation
products of Mg alloys, and vascular endothelial cells also have the
function with the phagocytosis of foreign bodies.40−42 Then, according
to the study of Champion and Mitragotri,43 the needle-like morphology was conducive to the phagocytosis of
macrophages. Hence, it is hypothesized that PIEC would start the phagocytosis
at the two ends of the needle-like corrosion product. PIEC may be
dead when the cells devour the needle-like products due to the products
having a size similar to cells.

coculture test of 1.0 mg/mL
MgCO3·3H2O and cells for 5 days. The red
boxes show the phagocytosis of PIEC to needle-like MgCO3·3H2O.

The schematic process
of the degradation of the AZ91 alloy and
the phagocytosis of PIEC is shown in Figure 13. The insoluble immersion product of AZ91
in the environment of high humidity and CO2 content was
MgCO3·3H2O. MgCO3·3H2O had various forms like needle-like and rod-like (Figure 4). However, the collected
MgCO3·3H2O was the square rod-like product
(Figure 7). Interestingly,
the square rod-like MgCO3·3H2O changed
to the needle-like product with the development of the coculture of
MgCO3·3H2O and PIEC (Figure 8). MgCO3·3H2O
showed poor biocompatibility because its addition increased the pH
and Mg2+ content of the cell culture environment. Meanwhile,
PIEC may be dead due to devouring of the needle-like MgCO3·3H2O.

Figure 13 Schematic process of the degradation of the
AZ91 alloy and the
phagocytosis of PIEC.

In this paper, the insoluble
corrosion products of Mg alloys and
their effect on the biocompatibility of the Mg alloy were studied.
The product MgCO3·3H2O showed poor biocompatibility,
and the reason is analyzed as much as possible. However, due to the
difference between the in vivo and in vitro environment, understanding
the mechanism of MgCO3·3H2O affecting cell
growth is still needed. The study on insoluble corrosion products
is beneficial to further explore the complex effects of Mg alloy degradation
on organisms.

3 Conclusions
The
results of pH and weight loss in the immersion test revealed
that the degradation of AZ91 alloy can be alleviated by the high humidity
and CO2 content. Moreover, the corrosion of AZ91 in the
culture medium was obvious and more uniform, compared to that in PBS.
Therefore, the corrosion rate of the AZ91 alloy in PBS was slower
than that in the culture medium. The insoluble corrosion product of
AZ91 was MgCO3·3H2O, which showed three
shapes, needle, square, and radial, in the immersion test. The biocompatibility
test showed that MgCO3·3H2O could inhibit
the cell proliferation by increasing the pH and Mg2+ content
of the culture solution, and the inhibited effect of MgCO3·3H2O on the cells was more obvious with the increase
in culture time and content of products.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Preparation of AZ91 Mg Alloys
The
commercial standard AZ91 Mg alloy (Wuxi Taicheng Metal Material Products
Co. Ltd.; composition of AZ91 is shown in Table 3) with a diameter of 8 mm and a thickness
of 3 mm was used in this work. Samples of Mg alloys were ground by
a 400 grit SiC paper. Then, they were ultrasonically cleaned for 10
min with ethanol (C2H5OH, guaranteed reagent,
Beijing Chemical Works) to remove grease and other impurities. After
that, Mg alloys were dried in cold air. Before the immersion test,
Mg alloys were sterilized by ultraviolet irradiation for 30 min.

4.2 Immersion Test
First, the specimens
were divided into two groups, with three parallel samples for each
group. All of the Mg alloys were weighed before the immersion test.
Subsequently, the specimens were immersed in two different corrosion
solutions: the culture medium (A group) and phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS; B group). The composition of corrosion solutions is shown in Table 4. The samples were
subjected to the immersion test with an immersion rate of 0.880 cm2/mL (the volume of the corrosion solution was 2 mL). Lastly,
the experiment was carried out in a carbon dioxide (CO2) incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, and saturated degree
of humidity) for 12 days. The corrosion solution was not changed during
the immersion test.

The pH of the corrosion solution
was measured daily, the formation
of insoluble corrosion products was observed every 3 days using an
optical microscope, and the size of the needle-like insoluble corrosion
products was counted. After the immersion test, the corrosion solution
and products were collected after ultrasound treatment for 30 min,
which were eventually dried at 80 °C for 90 min to gain the powder
of corrosion products. Then, Mg alloys were removed from the corrosion
solution and cleaned by 200 g/L chromium trioxide (CrO3; 99.99%, Aladdin) solution for 10 min. Subsequently, Mg alloys were
rinsed by distilled water and dried in hot air. The corroded Mg alloys
were weighed, and the morphologies of Mg alloys were observed using
an optical microscope after 12 days immersion. Finally, the corrosion
products were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Cu Kα, D/max-A,
Rigaku, Japan) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Zeiss, Germany).

4.3 Biocompatibility Evaluation
In this
experiment, the insoluble corrosion product (MgCO3·3H2O, purity, ≥99%, Shanghai Kaishefeng Industrial Co.
Ltd.) was tested. Pig iliac endothelial cells (PIEC; Shanghai Zhong
Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology Co. Ltd.) were used to evaluate the biocompatibility
of MgCO3·3H2O. Moreover, the cell culture
medium was composed of 90 vol % cell basic (RPMI-1640 medium, Gibco)
and 10 vol % fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone) followed by the addition
of penicillin–streptomycin solution (Hyclone) at a ratio of
1000:1. The density of the cell suspension was 10 × 104 cells/mL. Then, they were seeded in 35 mm Petri dishes (the volume
of the cell suspension was 2 mL). Subsequently, the Petri dish was
divided into three groups, and the UV-sterilized insoluble corrosion
product was cultured together with the cell suspension. In the first
group (C group), the concentration of the corrosion product was 1.5
mg/mL; in the second group (D group), the content was 1.0 mg/mL. The
third group (E group) was the blank control group (the concentration
of the corrosion product was 0 mg/mL). The experiment was carried
out in a CO2 incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2,
and saturated degree of humidity). After 1, 3, and 5 days of culture,
the cell number of the biocompatibility test was recorded, and the
morphologies of MgCO3·3H2O were observed.
The pH and content of Mg2+ in the culture solution were
detected daily.
