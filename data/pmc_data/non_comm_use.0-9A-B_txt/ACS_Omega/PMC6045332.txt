Electroactive biomaterials
that are easily processed as scaffolds
with good biocompatibility for tissue regeneration are difficult to
design. Herein, the synthesis and characterization of a variety of
novel electroactive, biodegradable biomaterials based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene)
copolymerized with poly(d,l lactic acid) (PEDOT-co-PDLLA) are presented. These copolymers were obtained
using (2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methanol
(EDOT-OH) as an initiator in a lactide ring-opening polymerization
reaction, resulting in EDOT–PDLLA macromonomer. Conducting
PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymers (in three different proportions)
were achieved by chemical copolymerization with 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene
(EDOT) monomers and persulfate oxidant. The PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymers were structurally characterized by 1H NMR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry
confirmed the electroactive character of the materials, and conductivity
measurements were performed via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
In vitro biodegradability was evaluated using proteinase K over 35 days, showing 29–46% (w/w) biodegradation. Noncytotoxicity
was assessed by adhesion, migration, and proliferation assays using
embryonic stem cells (E14.tg2a); excellent neuronal differentiation
was observed. These novel electroactive and biodegradable PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymers present surface chemistry and charge
density properties that make them potentially useful as scaffold materials
in different fields of applications, especially for neuronal tissue
engineering.

==== Body
Introduction
Biomaterials play a
pivotal role in the field of tissue engineering1 and have been used to induce and accelerate various
phenomena, such as tissue regeneration in wound healing;2 rapid repair of articular cartilage with very
little capacity for spontaneous healing;3 and regeneration of damaged tissues using highly porous scaffold
biomaterials4 in bones,5,6 the
cardiovascular system,7,8 muscles,9,10 blood
vessels,11,12 and the neuronal system.13−15

Stem
cells are unspecialized cells with the capacity for self-renewal
and pluripotency.16 Stem cells maintain
these characteristics when grown in the presence of leukemia inhibitor
factor (LIF).17 The derivation of embryonic
stem cells (ESCs) from the inner cell mass of blastocyst stage embryos
was first reported in 1981.18 ESC culture
in the absence of LIF leads to the spontaneous formation of suspended
cell aggregates, called embryoid bodies (EBs).19 Once adhered, the migration of cells at the periphery of
EBs is stimulated. ESCs can differentiate into the cell types of all
three germ layers and give rise to any mature cell of the adult organism,
making them an unlimited supply for basic research and a promising
therapeutic tool for regenerative medicine.20,21 Functional differentiated cells can potentially repair or replace
tissue damaged by diseases or injuries,22 such as diabetes, heart attack,23 Parkinson’s
disease, and spinal cord injury.24 However,
protocols that allow for the better control of ESC differentiation
into specific neuronal lines still require optimization. Microenvironmental
mechanical properties detected by cells in contact with substrates
have the ability to influence cell adhesion, migration, proliferation,
and differentiation.25,26 In recent years, there has been
an increasing interest in developing materials that function as support
matrices for guiding more effective cellular differentiation. These
biocompatible polymeric substrates also facilitate cell transplantation
because cooperation between cells is preserved, which is essential
to their communication and survival.27

Biodegradable biomaterials are solid polymeric materials and devices
that provide temporary sustentation during tissue healing procedures
and enhance self-repair from injury.28,29 Biodegradable
biomaterials should not provoke sustained inflammatory or toxic responses
upon implantation in the body and should have an acceptable shelf
life. Their biodegradation time should match the healing or regeneration
process, and furthermore, biodegradation products should be nontoxic
and be metabolized and cleared from the body. Finally, biodegradable
materials should have acceptable mechanical properties for the desired
application.30 In this context, biodegradable
polymers based on polyesters appear to be promising candidates because
of their good biocompatibility. Among these polyesters, polyglycolide,31,32 polylactides [poly(l lactic acid) (PLLA), poly(d-lactic acid) (PDLA) or poly(d,l lactic acid) (PDLLA)],33−35 and polycaprolactones13,36 have been the most
studied. The difference in biodegradability between PDLLA and PLLA
lies in the fact that PLLA presents higher crystalline structures,
which lead to lower biodegradation rates. Variations in the size and
thickness of PDLLA can affect the hydrolysis rate.37−39 Biodegradation
rates can also be controlled by adjusting the molecular weight of
PLA40 or by changing the feed mole ratio
of the biodegradable polymer in a copolymer composition.41

Electroactive biomaterials are a new generation
of “smart”
biomaterials based on conducting polymers (CPs).42 Poor molecular interaction with cells is the main challenge
to face for the use of CPs as biomaterials,43 even though their biocompatibility can be highly improved by doping
with specific anions44,45 but, despite this, electroactive
polymers still present low or no biodegradability.46

Schmidt and co-workers47 proposed a
novel biodegradable and electrical CP for biomedical applications
based on a triblock polymer comprising three electroactive monomer
units (polypyrrole–thiophene–polypyrrole) linked with
degradable ester linkages to an aliphatic linker (4 carbons). Jing
and co-workers48 proposed a biomaterial
based on a conducting and biodegradable copolymer, consisting of an
aniline pentamer (AP) with a PLA triblock, called PLA-b-AP-b-PLA. Because of Jing’s approach for
conducting and biodegradable copolymer biomedical application, a large
number of modified copolymers have been developed, such as an electroactive
star-shaped memory polymer,49 and others
mainly based on aniline oligomers,41,50 and blends
with PDLLA,51 among others.52−56 However, polyaniline (PANI)-based polymers still show cytotoxicity
because of their conductive emeraldine forms being stable only at
pH levels lower than 4, thereby limiting their use in biomedical applications.48,57,58 In this sense, other CPs, such
as those based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene) (PEDOT), arise as
an alternative for biomedical applications because they are electroactive
in the whole pH range.

Concerning about the role of PEDOT among
the different kinds of
CPs, it has emerged as the champion material in the organic bioelectronics
field, both in the biosensing domain and also for integration with
living cells (both in vitro and in vivo). Also, it can be synthesized
in many versatile ways, such as chemical oxidative polymerization,
vapor phase polymerization, or direct electrochemical polymerization,
mainly as thin film to be incorporated in a wide spectrum of devices.59

Recently, some works presenting different
strategies to achieve
PEDOT derivatives such as a (bio)functional dioxythiophene monomer60−62 have been published. Mawad and co-workers showed a functionalized
PEDOT synthesized from a modified EDOT-COOH which is possible to link
with hydrophilic polymers similar to PEG to obtain PEDOT hydrogels.63 Other interesting approach was used by Zhu and
co-workers which used EDOT-OH to synthesize functionalized PEDOT copolymers,
formed by EDOT-PC (functionalized with phosphorylcholine) and EDOT-MI
(with maleimide), with surface chemistry mimicking cell membrane with
resistance to nonspecific enzyme/cell binding and recognizing target
cells specifically.64

The challenges
for developing biomaterials for active scaffolds
by electrical stimulation include (1) the difficulty of working with
CPs which can only be obtained over electrodes by electrochemical
synthesis; (2) to achieve surface chemistry which enables surface
charge keeping biocompatibility for living cells culture; and (3)
poor compatibility between conducting and biodegradable polymers.
Here, we report the synthesis of a novel electroactive, biodegradable,
and noncytotoxic copolymer (PEDOT-co-PDLLA) which
joins the properties of both homopolymers in a single biomaterial.
This is the first report of an electroactive biodegradable biomaterial
based on PEDOT, offering the possibility of tuning conductivity and
biodegradability by changing the composition.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of Conducting and Biodegradable Copolymer of PEDOT-co-PDLLA
The synthesis of PEDOT-co-PDLLA
is shown in Scheme 1. The first step was the synthesis of a novel electroactive
macromonomer, EDOT–PDLLA, using EDOT-OH as the initiator, and
polymerizing PDLLA through a lactide ring-opening reaction catalyzed
by Sn(oct)2. This macromolecule corresponded to the biodegradable
moiety of the copolymer. The second step was the formation of PEDOT-co-PDLLA at three different molar ratios, that is, 1:05,
1:25, and 1:50 PEDOT:PDLLA.

Synthesis of Conducting and Biodegradable Copolymer PEDOT-co-PDLLA, and (C) Structural Representation of Copolymer
with Charge on Conducting Backbone of PEDOT and Branched PDLLA Chains
To follow the proportion of
PEDOT:PDLLA in this synthesis, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) analyses were performed
for all prepared copolymers (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). In the EDOT–PDLLA spectrum, at 5.25 and
1.50 ppm, the corresponding multiplet signals of CH and CH3 of the PDLLA structure are shown. Additionally, the singlet at 6.36
ppm and a group of multiplets at 3.95–4.45 ppm are likely related
to EDOT bonded to PDLLA chains. By analyzing the relative intensity
of the signals, the EDOT signals are much lower than the PDLLA signals
because of the higher amount of lactic acid units in the polymer compared
with EDOT. A signal at 2.4 ppm was also observed in the other spectra
and corresponded to the residual solvent. Regarding the PEDOT-co-PDLLA spectra, a singlet observed at 4.20 ppm corresponding
to the CH of EDOT monomers in the PEDOT chain confirms the formation
of the copolymer. By integrating the singlet at 4.20 ppm which corresponds
to 2 CH present in every EDOT unit and comparing with the multiplet
centered at 5.25 ppm (corresponding to CH from PDLLA), it was possible
to obtain the actual molar ratio of 1:20, 1:40, and 1:80, respectively.
Even though, for the whole manuscript, the feed synthesis proportion
will be maintained for indicating the different copolymers.

The infrared spectra of EDOT–PDLLA and PEDOT-co-PDLLA at three proportions are presented (Figure S1, Supporting Information). It is possible to see
that the EDOT–PDLLA spectrum presents two bands at 765 and
872 cm–1, which are diminished in the polymerized
structures. For a better comprehension, DFT/PBE-D3/def2-TZV was used,
and the theoretical spectrum obtained presented two bands with low
intensity at 765.88 and 872 cm–1. These vibration
groups are represented in Figure 1. Moreover, Figure S2 (Supporting Information) presents vibrations in 2998–2850 and at
1756 cm–1 for all spectra, corresponding to CH and
CH3 stretching and C=O, respectively, confirming
the higher amounts of PDLLA in the structures.65−67

Figure 1 DFT/PBE-D3/def2-TZV optimized
structures of EDOT–PDLLA macromonomers.
Arrows indicate the most important contributing vibrations in the
calculated band at (A) 766.88 and (B) 872 cm–1.

Figure 1 shows two
different vibrations that explain the results at the highlighted bands,
in the macromonomer spectrum (see Figure S2, Supporting Information). The one at the lower wavenumber corresponds with
the symmetrical bending of the H atoms vicinal to the S atom in EDOT.
The other band, at higher energy, corresponds with the same asymmetrical
bending. Because these vibrations were not present in the other molecules,
this showed that these are the bonding sites to other monomers during
the polymerization.

Other bands in the spectra must also be
analyzed, that is, at 1090,
1130, 1190, 1450, 1640, and 1750 cm–1, especially
in the spectrum corresponding to the 1:25 proportion, where all of
the bands are enlarged and a shoulder at 1640 cm–1 is clearly observed. All of these vibrations are related to the
PDLLA backbone and can be assigned to ρCH2 mode (1090
cm–1), νC–C (EDOT–PDLLA) (1130
cm–1), τCH2 (1190 cm–1), and δCH2 (1450 cm–1); related
to the C atom in PDLLA backbone vicinal to the PEDOT one. The band
at 1640 cm–1 is related to the νC=O
mode of the segments located far away from the conductive backbone,
whereas the band at 1750 cm–1 can be assigned to
the carbonyl group of the ester segment close to the PEDOT backbone.
In the spectrum of the macromonomer EDOT–PDLLA, these bands
are all sharp indicating that these vibrations do not present high
degree of freedom, an indication of a more rigid structure. As already
mentioned, in the spectrum corresponding to the copolymers, the bands
are broad and enlarged, a consequence of higher degree of interactions
of the biodegradable backbones, leading to a conformation that induces
the conductive backbone to be more twisted.

Electrochemical Behavior
Cyclic voltammetry was used
to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the three PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymers with different proportions. Figure 2 shows the j/E potentiodynamic profiles of the different
films deposited onto glassy carbon electrodes. The electrochemical
response of a film of the macromonomer is also presented for comparison.

Figure 2 j/E potentiodynamic profiles
of bare glassy carbon (black), EDOT–PDLLA (gray), and conducting
biodegradable copolymer films of PEDOT-co-PDLLA 1:05
(red), 1:25 (green), and 1:50 (blue) in phosphate buffer electrolytic
solution. v = 0.01 V s–1.

Figure 2 shows the
fifth voltammetric cycle of each copolymer films after stabilization
in phosphoric buffer solution compared with bare vitreous carbon electrode
and with a spin-coated macromonomer (EDOT–PDLLA) film. The
full data with all cycles for each copolymer are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). By comparing
the j/E profile of the bare glassy
carbon electrode with that of the macromonomer film (EDOT–PDLLA),
the current generated with the macromonomer was found to be lower
than that on the bare electrode, confirming the macromonomer’s
insulating character. All PEDOT-co-PDLLA films in
the three different proportions showed typical cyclic voltammograms
as those observed for PEDOT, with oxidation peaks starting at −100
mV for the 1:50 copolymer and at 125 mV for the 1:25 and 1:05 copolymers
and the corresponding reduction ones. The peaks appear very broad
and not well-defined, but it is clear that the current is higher by
increasing the EDOT/EDOT–PDLLA ratio in the copolymer formation.

Table 1 shows the
conductivity values obtained by ac impedance measurements for different
PEDOT-co-PDLLA proportions compared with other conducting
and biodegradable copolymers based on aniline trimers and pentamers.40−42,48,68 The lowest PEDOT content (1:50) had conductivity comparable with
undoped aniline trimers. The intermediate PEDOT content (1:25) had
a slightly higher conductivity than aniline trimers doped with CSA.
The highest PEDOT content (1:05) had the highest conductivity among
all conducting and biodegradable copolymers, with a value 2.5 times
higher than that of the 1:25 PEDOT-co-PDLLA. These
results correlated with the voltammograms obtained from PEDOT-co-PDLLA films in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer.
In contrast to aniline-based copolymers, which are only highly conductive
at pH lower than 2 (the main problem to be solved for their application
in cell interfaces), PEDOT was stable at physiological pH values of
7.4.48,58,68 See the Supporting Information (Figure S3).

amide) copolymers. PEDOT-HA/PLLA: poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
doped with hyaluronic acid/poly (l-lactic acid) composite.

The PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymers showed conductivity
ranging from 4 × 10–8 to 5 × 10–5 S cm–1, as shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S4) and following conductivity equation
(eq 1), comparable with
other biomaterials.40−42,48,68 These conductivity values could indicate that EDOT–PDLLA
macromonomers enabled the formation of copolymers with degrees of
conjugation higher than aniline trimers/pentamers. On the other hand,
the loss of conjugation of the conducting backbone because of steric
effects related to the twisting of the PEDOT moieties functionalized
with long pending PDLLA chains cannot be ignored and will lead to
very low conductivities. Table 1 shows that by doubling PEDOT proportion from 1:50 to 1:25,
conductivity of PEDOT-co-PDLLA increases 103 times. When PEDOT changes from 1:25 to 1:05, around the same proportion
than before, conductivity increases just 2.5 times. Different effects
must affect the bulk conductivity such as the increase in the degree
of oligomerization together with a very twisted conducting backbone.
It is already known for PANI that oligomers with 20 units already
show conductivities similar to the polymeric chains70 and the same conclusion was reached for PEDOT studies.71 Therefore, in the present case, the slight increase
in conductivity (2.5 times) for 1:25 to 1:05 must be related to a
more important effect of the twisting of the chain. Even with an expected
higher degree of oligomerization, a very coiled conformation would
avoid conjugation as already known for PANI and polypyrrole.70,72−74

However, these macromonomers did not necessarily
form extremely
long chains as PEDOT itself. There are some experimental evidences
that the formed structures were PEDOT oligomers with chain lengths
that allow sufficient conjugation to achieve conductivity but were
far from pure doped PEDOT chains. It must be remembered that during
the oxidative synthesis in acetonitrile, only the soluble part is
used. As pure PEDOT is not soluble in organic solvents, all solid
precipitate is discarded. Some attempts were made to electropolymerize
the macromonomer74 but even that a rise
in current is observed corresponding to the oxidation of EDOT–PLLA,
no film is formed onto the electrode because of the formation of soluble
oligomers. In other words, this strategy to produce a new electroactive
and biodegradable biomaterial is very versatile and suggests that
a branched copolymer with conducting moieties was obtained, as illustrated
in Scheme 1.

Biodegradability
Tests
The biodegradation behaviors
of the three PEDOT-co-PDLLA polymers with different
proportions were studied in vitro by using proteinase K, a high activity enzyme responsible for the biodegradation of polyesters.75−77Scheme 2 shows the
chemical reactions for PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymers
and images of the PEDOT-co-PDLLA films before and
after 35 days of biodegradation.

Physical Aspects of PEDOT-co-PDLLA Films before and

Assay
The biodegradation profiles
of PEDOT-co-PDLLA
films of different proportions are shown in Figure 3, from which it can be inferred that the
lower the PDLLA content (higher PEDOT content) is, the faster the
biodegradation. The biodegradation of the macromonomer EDOT–PDLLA
in the same conditions and in the same period of time is also presented.

profiles of EDOT–PDLLA (black) PEDOT-co-PDLLA
1:05 (red), 1:25 (green), and 1:50 (blue) at 37
°C and 60 rpm.

The 1:05 copolymer (higher
content of PEDOT) biodegrades much more
rapidly than the others, whereas 1:25 and 1:50 do not present significant
difference from macromonomer of EDOT–PDLLA, possibly because
of the very low content of PEDOT in those copolymers. After 35 days,
1:05, 1:25, and 1:50 PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymers reached
45.9 ± 4.1, 35.6 ± 2.0, and 29.2 ± 2.0% weight losses,
respectively. Furthermore, its weight loss can be attributed to soluble
components cleaved by the enzyme and water molecules (Scheme 2A), but the remaining copolymer
films seem much more fragile when compared to the initial states (Scheme 2B). A few strategies
for tuning biodegradation rates have included changing the number
average molecular weight (Mn) of the biodegradable
moiety.40 The approach presented here employed
a fixed molecular weight electroactive EDOT–PDLLA macromonomer
and changed the molar ratio of EDOT–PDLLA to EDOT to obtain
PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymers with different biodegradation
rates.

Compared with recently synthesized
conducting and biodegradable
copolymers presented in the literature (Table 2), the PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymers
displayed an acceptable range of time for biodegradation. Although
our approach resulted in branched copolymers, their biodegradability
behavior was closer to those obtained for aniline trimers and pentamers
in block copolymers,40,41,56 which biodegrade much more rapidly than PEDOT-HA/PLLA composites.65 This provided strong evidence that the conducting
moiety of PEDOT is composed of oligomers long enough to present electroactivity
and conductivity but could be suitable for biomedical applications.
These copolymers are readily consumed by macrophages during the normal
wound healing response, thereby reducing the chances for long-term
adverse effects.47,78

Water Contact Angle of
PEDOT-co-PDLLA Films
The wettability of
the different PEDOT-co-PDLLA
copolymers were analyzed, and the results are listed in Table 3. It can be seen that the higher
PDLLA content in the copolymer is, the lower the water contact angle.
A polystyrene plate dish functionalized for cell culture was used
as a control and had a contact angle of 28° ± 3°. The
contact angle of the macromonomer EDOT–PDLLA was also measured
for comparison showing a more hydrophilic character than all of the
copolymers.

Cytotoxicity
Biocompatible polymers have been used
to replace parts of living systems or to provide intimate contact
with living tissues. To investigate the potential biocompatibility
of the PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymers with biological
systems, cytotoxic assays were performed with E14.tg2a ESCs using
trypan blue exclusion dye (Figure 4), as were adhesion and migration assays using neural
precursor cells (NPCs) sourced from predifferentiated ESCs induced
by embryoid body (EB) suspension cultures (Figure 5).

were
tested against the control (traditional polystyrene plate), on which
the cells were cultured for 24 h. (A) Optical microscopy images, calibration

compositions were tested against the commercial plastic dish (control),
to which the EBs adhered and the peripheral cells migrated. (A) Phase-contrast

culture, with a calibration bar corresponding to 200 μm; (B)
numbers of EBs adhered to the respective polymeric substrates; (C)
mean ratio of the migration halo normalized by the respective area
of each EB. Data are reported as mean values ± SD; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

Cell viability assays showed a slight decrease in proliferation
of the cells grown on PEDOT-co-PDLLA-based polymers
within the first 24 h. However, this decrease was only significant
for the PEDOT:PDLLA 1:25 composition, in which a more irregular dispersion
of particles occurred, possibly because of a decreased solubility.
Cell viability tended to decrease by approximately 10% when cells
were cultured on the copolymers compared with controls. However, this
reduction was not significant for any composition.

In the absence
of LIF, ESCs formed three-dimensional aggregates
called EBs, which recapitulate early mammalian embryogenesis with
spontaneous cell differentiation and generation of precursor cells
of the three germ layers.19 To form EBs,
undifferentiated ESCs were cultured in nonadherent Petri dishes, and
neuronal differentiation was induced by retinoic acid. After this
stage, EBs preferentially gave rise to mature neural cells as neurons
and glial cells. EBs were plated on traditional plastic plates and
on PEDOT-co-PDLLA-based polymers with PEDOT:PDLLA
proportions of 1:50, 1:25, and 1:05. EBs that had adhered on the substrates
were counted, and cell migration halos from the EBs were measured
with ImageJ software for a minimum of 30 EBs per condition (Figure 5). Good adhesion
of the EBs on the copolymers was observed; however, suitable PEDOT
levels in the cell support matrix composition bring together favorable
properties for adhesion of EBs, whereas higher amounts of PEDOT (i.e.,
composition 1:5) tended to inhibit cell adhesion and delayed cellular
migration within the first 24 h. A significant decrease in the mean
migration halo of adhered EBs on the PEDOT-co-PDLLA
substrates (1:25 and 1:05) was observed compared to the controls.

The cells were induced to neuronal differentiation and assayed
after 7 and 14 days. Cell morphologies after 7 days of differentiation
are shown in Figure 6, and the expression patterns of neuron-specific immunomarkers are
shown in Figure 7.
During the differentiation progress, cells expand more on the conductive
polymers than on traditional plastic, exhibiting an elongated shape
with more extensive neurites.

The cells were fixed
and immunostained on days 7 and 14 of the
differentiation process. Immunofluorescence assays (Figures 7 and 8) showed that neuronal differentiation was enhanced by PEDOT-co-PDLLA coatings.

staining by StrataQuest analysis software (TissueGnostics). Images
of phase-contrast and DAPI and Alexa488 fluorescent channels were
overlaid (column 1); migration halo analysis by combining and processing
images of DAPI and phase-contrast ROI (column 2); measurement of the
total lengths of anti-MAP2-tagged neurites (column 3).

Following 7 days of induction to neural differentiation,
immunostaining
for βIII-tubulin, indicative of young neurons, was observed
(Figure 7, first column
in red). Cells cultured on conductive polymers showed higher βIII-tubulin
staining and more neurite outgrowth compared to the control cell culture
substrate, suggesting that the nature and surface charge density provided
by the new polymeric substrates were crucial for neuronal differentiation
and orientation of neuronal extensions. After 14 days of differentiation,
a visible increase occurred in immunostaining for microtubule-associated
protein-2 (MAP2) expression, characteristic for mature neurons (Figure 7, third column in
green). This increase in MAP2 immunostaining was especially observed
for the PEDOT:PDLLA 1:50 polymer, suggesting that PEDOT-co-PDLLA polymers promote the maturation of neurons together with neurite
outgrowth, improving the complexity of the neural network. As further
seen in Figure 7 in
the control experiment, fewer mature neurons (MAP2-positive cells)
and higher staining intensity of glial cells (anti-S100β-positive
cells) were observed. This suggested that neurogenesis was favored
by PEDOT-co-PDLLA polymer substrates.

A quantitative
analysis of fluorescence images of DAPI (cell nuclei)-
and MAP2-positive neural progenitor cells with Alexa 488 secondary
antibody was performed using StrataQuest analysis software (TissueGnostics; Figure 8). The migration
area of the cells surrounding the EBs and the total length of the
neurofilaments were much larger when these agglomerated cells had
adhered to the PEDOT-co-PDLLA matrices. The 1:50
copolymer showed the best performance in the cell culture and differentiation
of neural progenitor cells, with 24 257 μm migration
halos and 13 885 μm neurofilament lengths. These values
represented increases of 65 and 370%, respectively, compared with
controls.

Discussion
Biological effects including
cell adhesion, migration, and biocompatibility
of a scaffold are essential for its applications in tissue engineering.
Cell attachment is a crucial prerequisite for biological applications
because when NPCs attached onto a scaffold under appropriate conditions,
they proliferate and differentiate into different cell types.

Surface charge density promotes electrostatic interactions between
the scaffold and the anchoring proteins of cells that trigger cell
signaling that models cell spreading, migration, and differentiation.
The orientation and adsorption rate of serum proteins in the substrate
is also affected by their surface charge, interfering in the activation
of integrins that feel the surrounding environment.79

In this context, Saltó and co-workers80 examined whether it is possible to modulate
the attachment
of neural stem cells onto oxidized and reduced PEDOT/tosylate surfaces,
and its results show that oxidized PEDOT increased (and reduced PEDOT
decreased) the adhesion of two different types of neural stem cells.
They explained that effects related to PEDOT surface in different
oxidation states could dictate the orientation of proteins, hence
controlling the stem cell adhesion and density. In other words, high
contents of adsorbed proteins are not favorable for optimal adhesion
for the two stem cell systems but rather their orientation. A dense
protein layer (observed on reduced surface of PEDOT) that is tightly
bound may prevent the formation of an ideal extracellular matrix onto
the substrate that allows optimal interaction with cells.

Furthermore,
Svennersten and co-workers44 proposed a
model to explain different effects of reduced and oxidized
surfaces on cell adhesion and viability of MDCK cells on PEDOT/tosylate
surface. Onto reduced surface (negative charged), fibronectin linked
in an optimal structure with RGD-domains readily to bind to ανβ3 integrin, confirming that hypothesis
that protein orientation plays an important role in the adhesion process.
Also, they mentioned that in terms of surface chemistry, groups as
−OH, −COOH, and −NH2 can bind to α5β1 integrin, whereas ανβ3 integrin is more specific in binding to −COOH.

Because the chemical composition, stiffness, wettability, topographical,
and electrical properties of the substrates can affect the biological
effect of the biomaterial, it becomes difficult to identify specifically
its origin;81,82 fortunately, the comparison experiment
offers some clues:

Compared with commercial polystyrene, PDLLA-based
copolymers present
the advantage of containing −COOH and −OH groups that
improve the surface chemistry for interaction with components of the
cell membrane. Besides that, during PEDOT-co-PDLLA
synthesis, the oxidation of PEDOT with persulfate leads to positive-charged
chains of PEDOT doped with SO42– as counter-ions.
Charge density increases proportionally with the PEDOT content from
1:50 to 1:05.

The nature of a charge density in CP electrodes,
in analogy to
that created by well-defined Helmholtz layers on metal electrodes,
has to our knowledge never been described, which makes it even more
complicated to understand the interface of CPs with cell culture.
Because positive-charged PEDOT chains are in contact with water, proteins,
and different ions in the culture media, it is possible to state that
ions exchanged to counter-balance charges in PEDOT chains in a dynamic
equilibrium process simultaneously with proteins adsorbing to form
an adherent monolayer. This adsorption process is dominated by an
entropic gain by releasing the otherwise low-entropy water that is
near the interface.83,84 Moreover, it is not well-understood
if charges on the surface or electric fields generated by the motion
of ions close to the interface have direct influence on cell processes
such as adhesion, migration, and differentiation. However, it is well-known
that cell membrane is constituted by phosphatidylserine which induced
a negative charge and plays an important role in electrostatic interactions.85 In addition, neuronal cells have negative potential
in terms of balance of ions inside and outside cells,86 and it has been widely studied in the role of electric
field and stimulation on controlling ions signaling for neuronal cells.87,88

Undifferentiated ESCs require plasma-treated cell culture
polystyrene
which provides a negative charge on plastic surface encouraging cell
attachment. Higher growth of ESC colonies was observed for control,
followed by copolymers with the best dispersion of PEDOT, suggesting
that the presence of positive charges is critical for attachment and
proliferation of stem cells, in agreement with Saltó and co-workers.80

Surface properties as wettability and
roughness play a very important
role in modelling cellular adhesion. Adhesion of human fetal osteoblastic
cells was enhanced on PLLA with 5 nm Rq compared to polystyrene substrates with 3.84 nm,89 bringing evidence that the differences of nanotopography
of the concerned polymers can affect these cellular processes on other
cell models as neural cells.

The water contact angles of the
reduced and oxidized states of
PEDOT/tosylate electrode44 are 30°
± 5° and 58° ± 6°, respectively, that are
similar with contact angles of polystyrene surface (28° ±
3°) and oxidized PEDOT-co-PDLLA (51° to
64° dependent of PEDOT content), which suggests to be also a
condition to favor the growth of neural cells on the copolymer against
the control.

No obvious cytotoxicity of PEDOT-co-PDLLA could
be observed for neural stem cells. The good performance of PEDOT-co-PDLLA is consistent with the previous studies of films
based on both PDLLA and PEDOT which exhibited friendly interaction
with neural cells. Traditional tissue cultured polystyrene plates
have no charge, and data show that 7 days after retinoic acid removal
and FGF and N2 addition, the staining revealed an overall
difference in βIII-tubulin positive cells which is increased
when the cells are grown on PEDOT-co-PDLLA. Apart
from excellent noncytotoxicity, it is remarkable that PEDOT-co-PDLLA can enhance the ESCs differentiation toward astrocytes
and especially neurons. Charge and surface chemistry are key points
to the improved differentiation processes.

Conclusions
The
design of stimuli–response copolymers is an important
developing research area of biomaterials. Such novel biomaterials
should provide an optimal environment for the in vitro growth and
development of cells. Herein, PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymers
were synthesized and presented excellent electroactivity with a wide
conductivity range depending on the PEDOT content. The presence of
PDLLA segments offered the copolymers biodegradability, which should
be ideal for biomedical applications. In vitro cell experiments with
ESCs showed that the PEDOT-co-PDLLA substrates were
noncytotoxic and enhanced the differentiation process to neural cells.
Migration halos and neurofilament lengths were increased in 65 and
370%, respectively, compared with controls, for copolymers containing
1:50 PEDOT:PDLLA; this proportion presents increased hydrophilicity
and lower conductivity when compared to other copolymers with higher
amount of PEDOT. As discussed, charge and surface chemistry are key
points for the understanding of the mechanism of the differentiation
processes. These fabricated PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymers
can serve as novel electroactive, biodegradable, and biocompatible
materials potentially useful in different applications.

Experimental
Section
Materials
(2,3-Dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methanol (EDOT-OH) and 3,6-dimethyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione
(lactide) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Organometallic catalyst
tin(II)-2-ethylhexanoate (Sn(oct)2) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Toluene (99.5%), acetonitrile (99.5%), hexane (98.5%) chloroform (99.5%),
and methanol (99.5%) were purchased from Synth and were distilled
before use.

Chemical Synthesis of Conducting and Biodegradable
Copolymers
PEDOT-co-PDLLA
The first step of synthesis
was to obtain an electroactive macromonomer of EDOT–PDLLA.
3,6-Dimethyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione (2.76 g, 20 mmol), hydroxymethyl
EDOT (100 mg, 0.6 mmol), and tin(II)-2-ethylhexanoate (0.016 mL, 0.05
mmol) were stirred at 110 °C with 7 mL of toluene for 24 h. The
solvent was removed by distillation under reduced pressure (20 mBar,
60 °C). The obtained solid product was purified by recrystallization
with a (1:4) hexane/methanol mixture, separated by decantation and
vacuum dried until constant mass. The yield obtained from this procedure
was 98%.

1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3-d): δ 1.48–1.83 (m, 3H, Hh), 3.80–3.90
(m, 2H, He), 4.07–4.13 (m, 1H, Hd), 4.21–4.28
(m, 2H, Hc), 5.00–5.30 (m, 1H, Hg), 6.35
(s, 2H, Ha) ppm.

13C NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3-d): δ 16.7 (Ch), 66.7 (Cc), 69.0 (Cg), 69.2 (Ce), 72.5 (Cd), 116.4 (Ca), 129.0 (Cb) 169.4 (Cf) ppm.

The second step is composed of obtaining the
conducting and biodegradable
copolymer of PEDOT-co-PDLLA. For this, 2.7 g of the
macromonomer of EDOT–PDLLA was dissolved in 17.5 mL of dried
acetonitrile and kept under magnetic stirring at 30 °C for 2
h. Subsequently, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene (EDOT) (0.06 g, 0.42 mmol;
0.12 g, 0.81 mmol; and 0.60 g, 4.20 mmol) and NH4S2O8 (0.18 g, 0.8 mmol; 0.36 g, 1.62 mmol; and 1.80
g, 8.0 mmol) were added to the reaction vessel to obtain the proportions
of 1:50, 1:25, and 1:05 of PEDOT:PDLLA, respectively, and kept under
magnetic stirring at 30 °C for 24 h. After the reaction medium
changed to dark blue, only the soluble fraction was placed in another
glass vessel and the solvent was removed by distillation under reduced
pressure (20 mBar, 60 °C), and the resultant solid obtained was
PEDOT-co-PDLLA. Scheme 1 shows the structure and a representative
illustration of PEDOT-co-PDLLA, as analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy.

1H
NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3-d): δ 1.48–1.83
(m, 3H, Hh), 3.80–3.90
(m, 2H, He), 4.07–4.13 (m, 1H, Hd), 4.20
(s, 2H, CH2ofthiophenes, Hj), 4.21–4.28
(m, 2H, Hc), 5.00–5.30 (m, 1H, Hg), 6.32
(s, 2H, Ha) ppm.

13C NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3-d): δ 16.7 (Ch), 66.7 (Cc), 69.0 (Cg), 69.2 (Ce), 72.5 (Cd), 99.0 (C-thiophene,
Cj), 116.4 (Ca), 129.0 (Cb) 169.4
(Cf) ppm.

Instrumentation
1H and 13C spectra
were recorded on a Bruker AIII 500 MHz spectrometer at 500 and 125
MHz, respectively. Chloroform-d (CDCl3) was used as a solvent, and tetramethylsilane served as an internal
standard.

Infrared spectra were obtained with a Frontier Fourier
transform infrared spectrometer (PerkinElmer) with an attenuated total
reflection accessory. The spectra were captured in the 4000–600
cm–1 range, and an average of 32 scans was taken
at a resolution of 4 cm–1.

Electrochemical
experiments were performed using a multipotentiostat
Autolab M101 (Metrohm), controlled by NOVA 1.11 software. All experiments
were performed using a platinum sheet and Ag/AgCl/Cl–(sat) as counter and reference electrodes, respectively.

For electrochemical experiments, EDOT–PDLLA or PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymer thin films were deposited onto glassy
carbon electrodes; while for cell culture experiments, indium tin
oxide (ITO)-coated glasses were used as substrates. Moreover, 20 mg/mL
solutions of each copolymer or macromonomer in chloroform were prepared;
then, 200 μL of each solution was slowly casted on the substrate
(either glassy carbon electrode or ITO) by using an Ossila spin-coater
under constant 3000 rpm rotation.

The conductivity of the copolymer
films was measured by placing
the copolymer films between two identical gold electrodes (diameter
of 1 cm) and using a multipotentiostat Autolab M101 (Metrohm). The
ac impedance was measured over a 0.01 to 105 Hz frequency
range and an amplitude of 10 mV. The conductivity was calculated using eq 1(90) 1  where σ is the conductivity in S cm–1, R is the Ohmic resistance of the
copolymer, l is the distance between the two electrodes,
and A is the area of the electrodes.

For biodegradation
tests, a traditional procedure was employed.76,77 The PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymer films were placed
in a vial 2 cm in diameter. Phosphate buffer solution was prepared
at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. Each vial with copolymer film was weighed,
and 5 mL of PBS, 1 mg of proteinase K, and 0.5 mg
of chloramphenicol were added. The vials were placed in a 37 °C
shaker at a rotating speed of 60 rpm. The buffer and proteinase
K solution were replaced every 24 h to maintain the activity.
Copolymer films were withdrawn every 7 days and washed twice with
deionized water. Films were dried in an oven at 50 °C overnight
and vacuum-dried for 2 days to remove moisture. Dry specimens were
weighed, and the mass loss was calculated by the following equation 2  

Static
water contact angle measurements were used to evaluate the
surface hydrophilicity of the PEDOT-co-PDLLA copolymers
at different proportions. A drop of Milli-Q water was placed onto
the surface of the sample, and a picture of the water drop was taken
by a PixeLINK digital camera, coupled with Nikon optics. The images
were then analyzed with ImageJ software to obtain the contact angle.
The average of five measurements at different positions on the film
was taken to calculate the contact angle.

In Silico Structure Optimization
The macromonomer structure
was optimized by DFT calculations with ORCA 3.0.391 using the PBE functional92 and
atomic basis set Ahlrichs-def2-TZV,93,94 and to consider
dispersion effects, Grimme’s dispersion (D3) with the Becke–Johnson
damping parameter95 was used. Hereafter,
this process is named DFT/PBE-D3/def2-TZV. EDOT bonded to three units
of an LA chain was used as a monomer model.

Cell Culture and Differentiation
Undifferentiated E14.tg2a
mouse ESCs were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM), supplemented with 1% nonessential amino
acids (NEAA), 15% ESCs qualified fetal bovine serum (FBS), 7 μg/mL
leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL
streptomycin. EBs were formed in suspension by culturing 5 ×
106 cells in nonadherent plates in high glucose DMEM medium
without LIF and with 1% NEAA and 20% FBS for 2 days, followed by 4
days of neural differentiation induction by 2 μM retinoic acid,
changing the medium every 2 days. The EBs were plated on polymer scaffolds
in DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast
growth factor and 1% Bottenstein’s N-2 formulation to induce
neuronal differentiation during 14 days. Incubation was carried under
5% CO2 and 95% humidity at 37 °C.

Cell Viability
Assay
To investigate the biocompatibility
of the polymeric scaffolds with different compositions, E14.tg2a cells
were seeded at a density of 1 × 105/cm2 onto traditional polystyrene plates or onto copolymers films with
proportions of 1:50, 1:25, and 1:05 of PEDOT:PDLLA deposited on ITO
glass substrates. After 24 h, ES colonies were detached using TrypLE
Express and dissociated into single cells. Dead cells were stained
with 0.08% trypan blue dye mixed with cell suspension (1:1). Cell
viability was determined by counting stained and unstained cells with
a Neubauer chamber on an inverted microscope.

Embryoid Body Attachment
and Cell Migration Assay
Cell
adhesion was evaluated by the number of EBs able to attach onto the
polymeric substrates. After formation and neural induction, 30 EBs
were plated onto traditional plastic surfaces or PEDOT-co-PDLLA-based scaffolds with increasing concentrations of PEDOT. Cells
were incubated at ideal conditions for 24 h. Then, the medium with
unattached EBs was changed. EBs adhered onto the polymeric surfaces
were counted. To measure cell migration from the EBs, images were
recorded after 48 h, and migration halos were analyzed and quantified
with StrataQuest software (TissueGnostics). This imaging analysis
program analyzed data obtained from tissue or cell culture slides
using a workflow similar to that of flow cytometry. Gating procedures
were used to determine cell populations positive or negative for epitope
expression of interest. DAPI fluorescence was used as a master channel
for cell quantification. Images of phase-contrast and DAPI and MAP2-staining
Alexa488 fluorescence channels were overlapped. Migration halo analysis
was performed by combining and processing the images of DAPI and phase-contrast
ROI. Total length measurements of anti-MAP2-tagged neurites were performed.

Immunofluorescence Staining Assay
Differentiated cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature,
followed by three washes with PBS. The cells were incubated with blocking
solution (0.05% Triton X-100 and 4% FBS in PBS) for 1 h and subsequently
incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The next day,
PBS washes were followed by incubation with secondary antibody for
2 h at room temperature in the dark. The primary antibodies used and
their dilutions were β3-tubulin and MAP2 (1:200). Alexa488 anti-rabbit
and anti-mouse antibodies (1:1000) were used as secondary antibodies.
The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and incubated for
counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyllindole (DAPI).
DAPI was used as the master channel to identify nuclei.
