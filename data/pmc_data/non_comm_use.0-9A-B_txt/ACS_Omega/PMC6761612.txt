A practical and efficient
method has been developed for the preparation
of optically active α-hydroxyphosphonates through resolution
of the racemates. Treatment of racemic diethyl 1-hydroxy-1-phenylmethylphosphonate
(1) with (+)-dibenzoyl-L-tartaric anhydride gave two
diastereomeric esters 2 and 3 in the presence
of bismuth triflate (15 mol %) in an 86:14 ratio. The two diastereomeric
esters were separated by simple column chromatography, and the structure
for the major diastereomer was determined by X-ray crystallographic
analysis. Simple hydrolysis of the isolated major diastereomer in
the usual manner afforded (R)-O,O-diethyl-1-[hydroxyl(phenyl)methyl] phosphonate 1. The advantages of the present method are that the operation is
simple and easy to handle, along with rapid and good yield preparations
of both enantiomers of the racemic α-phosphonates 1. Diastereoselective reactions of various racemic α-hydroxyphosphonates
with d-Bz-L-TA in the presence of Bi(OTf)3 are also described.

Introduction
α-Substituted
phosphonates have received considerable attention
in medicinal and organic chemistry.1−5 Among α-substituted phosphonates, α-hydroxyphosphonates
and their acids are considered as structural analogues of α-hydroxycarboxy
acids that possess potential biological activities applicable to inhibitors
against EPSPS synthase, autotoxin inhibitors, and enzyme inhibitors
toward rennin and HIV protease.6−8 Moreover, α-hydroxyphosphonates
are a convenient precursor for the synthesis of other biologically
significant α-substituted phosphonates such as α-aminophosphonates.
It is not surprising that the biological activity is often dependent
on the absolute configuration of the α-position of the phosphoryl
compounds.9−11 Therefore, the preparation of α-hydroxyphosphonates
in the enantiomerically pure form can be an attractive research area
in view of medicinal chemistry.

Various synthetic methods have
been described for the synthesis
of racemic α-hydroxyphosphonates.12−18 Beside these works, many researchers are challenging to obtain the
enantiomerically pure forms by using various methods including asymmetric
dihydroxylation of vinylphosphonates and hydrophosphonylation of aldehydes
with asymmetric catalysts. To obtain optically active α-hydroxyphosphonates
from the racemates, many works report the kinetic resolution of racemic
α-hydroxyphosphonates by lipase-catalyzed acyl transfer reaction
or hydrolysis reaction of their acyl counterpart.19−21 However, the
resolution of racemic α-hydoxyphosphonates with chemical resolving
agents is rarely examined. In this context, we have pursued to find
efficient resolving agents for racemic α-hydroxyphosphonates.22−25

l-Tartaric anhydride (L-TA) and O,O′-dibenzoyl-l-tartaric
anhydride
(d-Bz-L-TA) have been employed as efficient chiral resolving
agents for the separation of racemic alcohols and amines (Figure 1).26 In the resolution with these resolving agents, the racemic
alcohols and amines are usually converted to a diastereomeric mixture
of the half-esters derived from d-Bz-L-TA, which are
readily separated by column chromatography. There is only one literature
note discussing the application of d-Bz-L-TA as a chiral
resolving agent for the separation of racemic aminophosphonates.27 As part of our efforts to develop facile and
practical methods for the separation of racemic phosphonic and phosphinic
acid derivatives,31−33 we have recently developed a novel method for the
preparation of (R)- and (S)-pyrrolidine-2-phosphonic
acids through resolution of (±)-diethyl pyrrolidine-2-phosphonate
by the formation of diastereomeric amides with d-Bz-L-TA.34 In our continuous research program
directed to the preparation of optically active α-substituted
phosphonates, now, we have focused on the method applicable to the
resolution of α-hydroxyphosphonates. Herein, we report on the
preparation of optically active α-hydroxyphosphonates through
Lewis acid-catalyzed stereoselective acylation of racemic diethyl
1-hydroxy-1-phenylmethylphosphonate (rac-1) with d-Bz-L-TA.

Figure 1 Structures of α-hydroxyphosphonates, L-TA, and d-Bz-L-TA.

Results
and Discussions
Racemic diethyl 1-hydroxy-1-phenylmethylphosphonate
(rac-1) was prepared in a quantitative yield according
to an earlier reported
method by our laboratory (Scheme 1).35d-Bz-L-TA was prepared via the thermal heating of a mixture of l-tartaric
acid and benzoyl chloride (3 equiv) according to the method reported
by Bell.26

Scheme 1 Preparation of rac-1 and d-Bz-L-TA
Reaction of d-Bz-L-TA and rac-1 was examined
to give the diastereomeric mixtures of 2 and 3 under the various conditions. The diastereomeric ratios were determined
by 31P NMR analysis of the reaction mixture. The results
and experimental data for screening conditions are listed in Table 1. Upon treatment of rac-1 (1.0 equiv) with d-Bz-L-TA (1.0 equiv)
in CH2Cl2 (5 mL) at room temperature for 24
h without catalyst, no reaction occurred to give 2 and 3 (entry 1). However, in the presence of DMAP (10 mol %),36 the reaction proceeded at room temperature in
CH2Cl2 for 24 h to give a mixture of 2 and 3 in a low yield (36%). Under this reaction, the
individual enantiomer was acylated with d-Bz-L-TA in
an approximately similar rate to give 2 and 3 in the ratio of 51:49 (entry 2).

We anticipate
that if the acylation of the individual enantiomer
with d-Bz-L-TA significantly differs in their reaction
rates, the kinetic resolution of rac-1 would be feasible.
Keeping this in mind, acylation of rac-1 with 1 equiv
of d-Bz-L-TA was studied in the presence of various Lewis
acids.33−41

In these experiments, no reaction was observed when FeCl3 and ZnCl2 were used as catalysts (entries 3 and
4). Upon
using AlCl3 and BiCl3, equal amounts of the
half esters 2 and 3 were obtained in low
yields after 24 h (entries 5 and 6). No catalytic activities were
observed with Sc(OTf)3 (entry 7). In an effort to find
good catalytic systems, we are interested in using bismuth triflate
(Bi(OTf)3), which is a nontoxic and eco-friendly Lewis
acid catalyst that has been reported for many organic transformations.28,29 It has also been shown that Bi(OTf)3 is one of the most
efficient catalysts for the large scale acylation of alcohols.30 Interestingly, when the reaction was conducted
with Bi(OTf)3 (0.15 equiv) in CH2Cl2 for 24 h, the mixture of 2 and 3 was obtained
in 58% yield in a ratio of 83:17 (entry 8). In this reaction, a large
amount of (S)-diethyl 1-hydroxy-1-phenylmethylphosphonate
((S)-1) remained unreacted and isolated.
The enantiomeric excess (ee) of (S)-1 obtained from this reaction was determined by HPLC analysis to be
83% (Chiralpak OD-H column).

To improve the diastereomeric ratio
of 2 and 3, the effects of the amount of
Bi(OTf)3, the reaction
times and temperatures, and solvents were investigated (entries 8–20).
The results showed that decreasing the reaction time resulted in only
a slight loss in the diastereoselectivity, along with decreasing the
reaction yields (entries 8–11). Decreasing amounts of the catalyst
gave a marked decrease in the yield of the mixture of 2 and 3, without a significant loss in the diastereomeric
ratios (entries 9 and 12–13). The reaction temperature strongly
affects the yield but not the diastereoselectivity. When the reaction
was carried out at −40 °C for 24 h, the reaction yield
was decreased to 37% with no remarkable change in stereoselection
(entry 8 vs 15). The results for the reactions conducted in various
solvents showed that there was no reaction when methanol and CH3CN were used as polar protic and nonprotic solvents (entries
19 and 20), while using dioxane and toluene, the half esters 2 and 3 were obtained in modest yields in moderate
selectivity (entries 16 and 18). It is worthy to note that the acylation
of rac-1 proceeds to give an equal amount of individual
diastereoisomer in a moderate yield when the reaction was conducted
in THF at room temperature (entry 17). When the reaction was conducted
with 0.5 equiv of anhydride, the mixture of 2 and 3 was obtained in 40% yield with a good diastereoselection
of 83:17 (entry 21).

The diastereomeric esters 2 and 3, obtained
by the optimal reaction conditions (entry 10), and enantioenriched
(S)-1 were readily separated by column
chromatography. Stereochemistry of the major diastereomer 2 was determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The crystal structure
of 2 is illustrated in Figure 2. At this stage, the analysis clearly shows
that the major diastereoisomer 2 is derived from (R)-1 by preferential reaction with d-Bz-L-TA under the same conditions. The enantiomeric excess of unreacted
(S)-1 was determined by HPLC analysis
using a chiral column (Chiralpak OD-H column).

−0.06 (4).

To constitute the resolution
of racemic α-hydroxyphosphonates 1, finally, hydrolysis
of 2 and 3 in an ammonia medium (25%) at
room temperature for 2 h was carried
out to yield (R)-1 and (S)-1 in quantitative yields, respectively. The specific
rotations of (R)-1 and (S)-1, prepared by our present method, were determined
to be [α]D20 + 24.5 (c 0.5, CHCl3) and [α]D20 −21.7(c 0.8, CHCl3), respectively. These data are in
good agreement correspond to reported data by Nesterov and Kolodiazhnyi
(Scheme 2).42

Scheme 2 Separation of Enantiomers of Compound 1 with d-Bz-L-TA
To survey the origins of the diastereoselectivity, interaction
of the rac-1 and d-Bz-L-TA with Bi(OTf)3 was studied by NMR experiments. In these experiments, the
chemical shift change of signals of 1H, 13C,
and 31P corresponding to rac-1 and d-Bz-L-TA was investigated in the presence or absence of Bi(OTf)3 (Table 2). The 31P NMR experiment with rac-1 shows that the phosphorus
atom resonated in downfield in the presence of Bi(OTf)3, as compared with that in the absence of Bi(OTf)3. On
the other hand, the 13C NMR analysis for interaction between d-Bz-L-TA and Bi(OTf)3 showed that chemical shift
corresponding to the C=O group of the anhydrous moiety shifts
to downfield in the presence of Bi(OTf)3. 1H
NMR analysis of the mixture of rac-1 and Bi(OTf)3 showed the broad signal corresponding to the OH group shifts
to downfield (Δδ = 0.62). On the basis of these results,
possible transition states for the Bi(OTf)3-catalyzed stereoselective
esterification of rac-1 with d-Bz-L-TA are
envisaged as shown in Scheme 3. In this mechanism, Bi(OTf)3 has a borderline
role and would coordinate not only to the ester moiety (C=O)
of d-Bz-L-TA but also to the P=O and OH groups
of rac-1, leading to dually activated transition states
(TS-A and TS-B), in which the activated
substrates would make two reaction sites (carbonyl and hydroxyl sites)
close. Subsequent acylation takes place readily through the nucleophilic
addition of the hydroxyl group of rac-1 to the bismuth-coordinated
anhydride to yield the compounds 2 and 3, respectively. On the basis of the Felkin-Anh model, it seems that
the TS-B produced from (R)-1 would more favorable than TS-A produced from (S)-1 due to highly steric hindrance of the
phenyl groups of (S)-1 and d-Bz-L-TA (Scheme 3).

In order to establish the generality of the present method, diastereoselective
reactions of various racemic α-hydroxyphosphonates 4 with d-Bz-L-TA in the presence of Bi(OTf)3 were examined, and the obtained results are summarized in Table 3. The diastereoselective reaction of α-hydroxyphosphonates bearing
aromatic ring with para-methoxy and para-nitro substituents gave a mixture of the corresponding 5 and 6 in a ratio of 89:11. This protocol was also applied
to α-hydroxyphosphonates bearing styryl- and naphthyl groups.
The reaction of the compounds 4c and 4d with d-Bz-L-TA in the presence of Bi(OTf)3 gave the
corresponding 5 and 6 in a ratio of 87:13
and 88:12 in moderate yields, respectively. α-Hydroxyphosphonate
with the nonaromatic substituent 4e also gave the corresponding 5 in 15% yield in the presence of Bi(OTf)3 for
24 h.

The diastereoselective
reaction of a quaternary α-hydroxyphosphonate 7 with d-Bz-L-TA in the presence of Bi(OTf)3 failed to give the corresponding diastereoisomers of 8 and 9 (Scheme 4). Surprisingly, the 31P NMR of the reaction
mixture showed two peaks for the compound 7 due to the
combination of compound 7 with d-Bz-L-TA in the presence of Bi(OTf)3 in TS (Figure S33 in the Supporting Information).

Scheme 4 Diastereoselective
Reaction of Compound 7 with d-Bz-L-TA in
the Presence of Bi(OTf)3
We have shown both enantiomers of diethyl 1-hydroxy-1-phenylmethylphosphonate
(rac-1) can be accessed by resolution of the racemic
mixture with (+)-dibenzoyl-l-tartaric anhydride (d-Bz-L-TA). In this study, we found that Bi(OTf)3-catalyzed acylation
of rac-1 with d-Bz-L-TA was preferable to
react with the R-enantiomer, as compared with the S-enantiomer in their reaction rates. This phenomenon was
applicable as a novel method for kinetic resolution of rac-1 to give diastereomerically pure 2 and enantioenriched
(S)-1. We have also studied the diastereoselective
reaction of various racemic α-hydroxyphosphonates with d-Bz-L-TA in the presence of Bi(OTf)3. The features
of the present method open up new ways for both enantiomers of 1-hydroxyphosphonate
derivatives.

Diethyl 1-Hydroxy-1-phenylmethylphosphonate
(rac-1)
This compound was obtained according
to the method reported
in our report.35 Diethyl phosphite (5.65
mL, 40 mmol) was added to a stirred mixture of benzaldehyde (4.16
mL, 40 mmol) and MgO (2 g) at ambient temperature. The resultant mixture
was mixed thoroughly with a mortar and pestle for 1 h. The mixture
was suspended in CH2Cl2 (100 mL) and the filtrate
was evaporated. The pure product of rac-1 was obtained
by recrystallization in CH2Cl2/n-hexane in 90% yield. White crystal, mp (n-hexane/CH2Cl2) = 76 °C.

Preparation of O,O′-Dibenzoyl-l-tartaric anhydride (d-Bz-L-TA)
d-Bz-L-TA was prepared according to the literature reported
method by Bell26 with a modification. A
mixture of l-(+)-tartaric acid (4.3 g, 28.7 mmol) and benzoyl
chloride (7.2 mL, 115 mmol) were heated at 130 °C for 15 h. The
mixture was cooled to room temperature, and during cooling, a light
brown solid was formed. The solid was washed with cold ether (100
mL) to give pure d-Bz-L-TA in 87% yield after recrystallization
from toluene. White crystal: mp 196–198 °C [Lit.43 mp 195–199 °C], 1H NMR

Compound rac-1 (1.22
g, 5 mmol) and Bi(OTf)3 (0.49 g, 15 mol %) were dissolved
in CH2Cl2 (5 mL). A solution of d-Bz-L-TA (0.85 g, 2.5 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5 mL) was added
dropwise into the reaction mixture. The mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 6 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue
was passed through a short column (silica-gel) using EtOAc-MeOH (100:0
to 95:5 v/v) as an eluent to give a crude mixture of 2 and 3 as a white solid and an unreacted compound 1 ((S)-1). The individual diastereomers 2 and 3 were subsequently separated by silica-gel
chromatography using a mixture of EtOAc–MeOH (100:0 to 95:5

(R)-Diethyl 1-Hydroxy-1-phenylmethylphosphonate
(R)-1
A solution of ester 2 (0.584 g, 1 mmol) in ethanol (7 mL) containing aqueous ammonia
(25%, 6 mL) was left at room temperature for 2 h. The volatiles were
removed in vacuo and the residue was passed through a short column
(silica-gel) using EtOAc as an eluent to give (R)-1 (0.205 g) in 84% yield.44 [

Diethyl
1-Hydroxyphosphonates (4 and 7)
The compounds were obtained according to the method reported
in our report.35 Diethyl phosphite (5.65
mL, 40 mmol) was added to a stirred mixture of aldehyde or acetophenone
(40 mmol) and MgO (2 g) at ambient temperature (60 °C in the
case of acetophenone). The resultant mixture was stirred for 1–12
h (depends on the nature of the carbonyl compound). The mixture was
suspended in CH2Cl2 (100 mL) and the filtrate
was evaporated. The pure products of 4 and 7 were obtained by recrystallization in CH2Cl2/n-hexane.
